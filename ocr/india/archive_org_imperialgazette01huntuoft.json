HUNTER, C.S.I., C.I.E, LL.D.,\nDIRECTOR-GENERAL OF STATISTICS TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA.\n\nVOLUME I.\nABAR TO B\u00c1L\u00c1SINOR.\n\nSECOND EDITION.\n\nTR\u00dcBNER & CO., LONDON, 1885.\nTO HER MOST GRACIOUS MAJESTY\n\nVICTORIA\n\nQUEEN OF ENGLAND AND EMPRESS OF INDIA\n\nTHIS WORK IS BY HER ROYAL PERMISSION\n\nDEDICATED.\nPREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION\nOF 1881.\n\n'WE are of opinion,' wrote the Court of Directors in 1807 to their servants in Bengal, 'that a Statistical Survey of the country would be attended with much utility; we therefore recommend proper steps to be taken for the execution of the same.' The despatch from which these words are quoted forms one of a long series of instructions in which the East India Company urged a systematic inquiry into its territories. The first formulated effort in Bengal dates from 1769, four years after that Province came into its hands; the latest orders of the Court of Directors on the subject were issued in 1855, three years before the administration of India passed from the Company to the Crown. During the interval many able and earnest men had laboured at the work, manuscript materials of great value had been amassed, and several important volumes had been published. But such attempts were isolated, directed by no central organization, and unsustained by any continuous plan of execution.\n\nThe ten years which followed the transfer of the government of India to the Crown in 1858, produced a new set of efforts towards the elucidation of the country. Conspicuous among them was the work begun in 1866 under the direction of Sir Richard Temple, when Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces.\u00b9 The controlling power in England had now passed from a body of experts, the Court of Directors, to Parliament\n\n\u00b9 Executed by Mr. Charles Grant (now Sir Charles Grant, K.C.S.I.), of the Bengal Civil Service, sometime Member of the Viceroy's Legislative Council and Foreign Secretary to the Government of India.\nand the nation at large. Accurate and accessible information regarding India was become, under the new system, an essential condition for the safe exercise of that control. Accordingly, in 1867, the Viceroy, acting on instructions from Her Majesty's Secretary of State, ordered an account to be drawn up for each of the twelve great Provinces of India.\n\nThe Provincial Governments struck out widely divergent schemes for conducting the work. It was as if a command had issued from some central power for a Statistical Survey of all Europe, and each nation set about its execution on a separate plan. It became apparent that vast sums of money would be expended, while considerable uncertainty existed as to the results. One local Government started on a scale which, if generally adopted, would have involved an outlay of \u00a3100,000 for the District materials alone. The head of another Province himself carried out the work, expeditiously and at scarcely any cost to the State; but on a system which, although admirably suited to the territories under his care, could not be applied to the rest of India. Meanwhile, the commercial community and various public bodies were pressing upon the Government the necessity of systematic organization, with a view to ensure uniformity in the execution of the work. Without such uniformity, the Council of the Asiatic Society pointed out that, when the local compilations came to be finally digested into the General Account of India, there would be no basis for comparative statistics, and much of the original work would have to be gone over again de novo.\n\n1 These Provinces, or rather political divisions under separate administration, were\u2014(1) Bengal; (2) Bombay; (3) Madras; (4) The North-Western Provinces and Oudh; (5) The Punjab; (6) Assam, in 1867 included in Bengal; (7) Central Provinces; (8) British Burma; (9) The Berars, under the Resident at Haiderabad; (10) Mysore and Coorg; (11) Rajputana; (12) Central India.\u2014Orders of the Government of India, No. 1758, dated 19th October 1867.\n\n2 Mr. Alfred Lyall, C.B., of the Bengal Civil Service, then Commissioner of West Berar; now Sir Alfred Lyall, K.C.B., and Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh.\nThe Viceroy arrived at the same conclusion; and in 1869, His Excellency directed me to visit the various Provincial Governments, with a view to 'submit a comprehensive scheme for utilizing the information already collected; for prescribing the principles' to be thenceforth adopted; 'and for the consolidation into one work of the whole of the materials that may be available.'\n\nIn carrying out these instructions, I found that the series of previous efforts had failed from two distinct causes. In one class of cases, a central officer of rank and ability had been appointed; but he had not been supported by adequate machinery for collecting the local materials. In another class, the District Officers had been left to work each on his own plan, without the guidance of any single mind. The first class had failed from want of local organization; the second, from want of central control.\u00b9 The task set before me consisted, in fact, of two separate stages\u2014First, a 'local inquiry,' con-\n\n\u00b9 The Governor-General in Council thus summed up the previous efforts, in a Resolution dated the 8th September 1871: 'Three distinct series of operations have in time past been undertaken or encouraged by the Government, with a view to obtaining trustworthy accounts of the country, such as might form a Gazetteer of India; the whole representing a very large outlay, commencing as far back as 1769, and one of the efforts costing \u00a330,000 for merely collecting the materials for part of a single Province. From a variety of causes, all more or less proceeding from defective organization, this large expenditure, while accumulating isolated materials of great value, failed to yield any systematic and comprehensive result.' The Resolution then reviewed the fresh operations ordered by the Secretary of State in 1867: 'Various schemes were set on foot to give effect to these orders, some of them so costly as to be altogether disproportionate to the results to be obtained. But His Excellency in Council observes that excessive costliness is not the only unfortunate effect of the want of organization, which left each local Government to invent a scheme of its own, irrespective of what was being done in other Provinces. There was, in fact, no unity of plan or central supervision, and the results did not contain the materials required for the comparative statistics of the Empire. . . . Widely different schemes have been propounded by the local administrations, some of them involving a very extravagant outlay, others of too meagre a character. Each local Government has given its own interpretation to the work; and the experience of the last few years shows that, in the absence of a central organization, the cost of the enterprise will swell to an enormous total, while the same heterogeneous incompleteness, which rendered all previous efforts infructuous, will again result.'\nducted on a uniform scheme, throughout each of the [then] 240 Districts, or administrative units, of British India: Second, the consolidation of the materials thus obtained into one book. The first stage could be effected only by a Statistical Survey of India; the second is represented by The Imperial Gazetteer. No basis existed at that time for either of these works. A Census had never been taken for British India; and in some Provinces the different departments of the same Government grounded their financial and administrative demands on widely diverse estimates of the population.\n\nAccordingly, in 1869, I submitted to the Governor-General in Council a Plan for a Statistical Survey and an Imperial Gazetteer of India.\\(^1\\) It endeavoured, First, to eliminate the causes of previous failures, by providing a uniform scheme, a local mechanism, and a central control. Second, to clearly define the objects of the present undertaking. These objects were partly of an administrative and partly of a general character; namely, 'for the use of the Controlling Body in England, of administrators in India, and of the public.' Third, to secure the co-operation of the Provincial Governments,\u2014lukewarm heretofore in such matters,\u2014by respecting their individuality, and by modifying the uniform scheme to suit the circumstances of their several Provinces. Fourth, to collect the materials at once systematically and cheaply, by enlisting the unpaid agency of the District Officers throughout India under a central control. The Government was pleased to approve of this Plan, and to 'secure for the execution of the design the supervision of the designer.'\n\n'The operations,' wrote the Governor-General in Council, 'will extend over ten separate Governments which, with their Feudatory States, administer a territory of \\(1\\frac{1}{2}\\) million square miles and govern a popula-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Printed at the Home Secretariat Press, 144 pp. folio. Calcutta, 1870.\n\n\\(^2\\) Proceedings of the Government of India, dated 8th September 1871.\ntion estimated at 200 million souls [since found to be 255 millions]. The work represents, therefore, a series of local inquiries and comparative statistics, spread over an area but little less than that of all Europe, excepting Russia, and a population then exceeding that of all Europe, less Russia. With a view to securing uniformity in the materials, I drew up six series of leading questions, illustrating the topographical, ethnical, agricultural, industrial, administrative, and medical aspects of an Indian District. These have served as a basis for the Statistical Survey throughout all India. With a view to securing punctuality of execution, Provincial Compilers were appointed, each responsible for getting in the returns from the District Officers within the territories assigned to him; for supplementing those returns by information from heads of Departments and other local sources; and for working up the results into the Statistical Account or Gazetteer of the Province. In this way, the unpaid co-operation of the administrative staff throughout the 240 Districts of India was enlisted, the best local knowledge was brought to bear, while in each Province a paid editor was answerable for the completion of the Provincial Account on a uniform plan and within a reasonable time. The supervision of the whole rested with me, as Director-General of Statistics to the Government of India. During one-half of each year, I visited the various Provinces, especially Bengal, which I retained in my own hands as Provincial Editor in addition to my duties as Director-General. The other half of each year, I devoted to testing and working up the results.\n\nDuring the past twelve years, the Statistical Survey has been conducted throughout the whole of British India. The District forms the administrative unit in India, and the Statistical Survey furnishes an elabo-\n\n1 Circulated to the Provincial Governments, under the title of 'Heads of Information required for the Imperial Gazetteer.'\nrate account of each of the 240 Districts. The Province is the administrative whole in India, and the Statistical Survey groups all the District materials into fifteen Provincial Accounts or Gazettes. Such a work, if it is to furnish a basis for administrative action in India, and supply data to the Controlling Body in England, must be at once comprehensive and minute. The District and Provincial Accounts will form about 120 printed volumes, aggregating 50,000 pages, of which 90 volumes, making over 32,000 pages, were issued by 1880. The operations have (1881) been completed throughout 12 Provinces and 210 Districts, representing a population of about 190 millions of souls.\n\n**The Statistical Survey of British India (1881).**\n\n| Province                  | Area in Square Miles | Population       | Number of Districts | Number Vols. and Pages printed: Jan. 1881 | Provincial Compiler |\n|---------------------------|----------------------|------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| 1.

The number of Districts is taken from the Parliamentary Abstract for 1877, except that Aden is added, and the number for Bengal is reckoned at 47, being the actual number of Districts dealt with in the Statistical Account of Bengal. Slight alterations have since been made; but the figures will remain substantially the same, till the results of the new Census are known. Mysore was returned to Native Rule in 1881.\n[Since the foregoing table was prepared in 1881, the Statistical Survey of British India has been completed in 119 volumes, aggregating 54,504 pages (1885).]\n\nThe Feudatory States and Chiefdoms, exceeding 300 in number, with 50 millions of people, were from the first placed outside the scope of the Statistical Survey. In these territories it was unsuitable to attempt minute investigations, which the native princes would have been likely to misunderstand, and able to frustrate. Accordingly, my Plan of 1869 restricted the Statistical Survey to the British territories, but pointed out that the Native States must be included in the ultimate compilation for all India, that is, the Imperial Gazetteer. Steps were therefore taken to bring together the information already existing regarding the Native States, and to supplement it. In States temporarily under British management, this was quite practicable; and Major Powlett's account of Alwar supplies an admirable specimen of what may be done under these circumstances.\n\nApart from such exceptional cases, I found that the 300 Native States of India had to be dealt with in five great groups. The first and most numerous class comprised the States and Chiefdoms which are in political dependence on the Provincial Governments. These States have accepted a large measure of British supervision, and the Provincial Compilers were able to draw up fairly adequate accounts of them. The second group consisted of the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na States; and two valuable volumes have been collected regarding them by Mr. Lyall (now Sir Alfred Lyall, K.C.B.) when Governor-General's Agent.\u00b9 For the third group, including the Central India States, I did not find myself in a position to bring forward specific proposals; and in the case of several of them, this book will add but little to the sum of human knowledge. In the fourth group, or the territories of the Niz\u00e1m, efforts were made at an\n\n\u00b9 The R\u00e1jput\u00e1na Gazetteer, 1879-80.\nearly stage to obtain the necessary materials from His Highness' Government. The fifth group consisted of Frontier and Independent States, such as Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n, Burma, and Nep\u00e1l. Some account of such States would be expected in the Imperial Gazetteer of India. But any account of them, drawn up from official sources and issued under the authority of the British Government, might give rise to uneasiness among the Princes who rule those territories, our neighbours and allies. After full consideration, it was decided that no special inquiry should be made with regard to trans-frontier Independent Kingdoms, and that no official documents should be used. The articles upon them in the Imperial Gazetteer are, accordingly, a mere reproduction of accounts already before the public; and for them no responsibility attaches to the Government.\n\nOf the five groups of Native States, therefore, the first was satisfactorily dealt with by means of the Provincial Compilers; the fifth can scarcely be said to have been dealt with at all. In the three intermediate groups, many isolated efforts were made, and a special Assistant was deputed to me in the Foreign Office, Calcutta, with a view to putting together the materials already existing. His labours were afterwards supplemented in the Political Department of the India Office. But the confidential relationship between the Government of India and its Feudatory States, the dislike of the native Princes to inquiries of a social or economic character, and the scrupulous delicacy of the Foreign Office to avoid grounds of offence, have rendered a complete treatment of such territories impossible. I beg that those who use this book will believe that the occasional meagreness of the results, and the inadequate treatment of certain Native States, are due not to want of anxious effort on my part, but to the conditions under which I worked. In some cases I have had to fall back on the old materials compiled, at the expense of the Court of\nDirectors, by Mr. Edward Thornton in the India House, and published by their authority, in four volumes, in 1854.\\(^1\\) As a whole, therefore, the articles on the Native States represent a much less exact method of inquiry than those on the British Provinces. They will be found, however, to mark a material advance in our information regarding Feudatory India. The basis for more systematic operations, a Census of the Feudatory Territories, does not exist; and a Statistical Survey of the Native States still remains unattempted.\n\n[Including the less exact work thus done for the Native States, the results of the Statistical Survey of British and Feudatory India, now (1886) make 128 printed volumes, aggregating 60,000 pages.]\n\nThe two primary objects of the operations were 'for the use of Indian administrators,' and 'for the use of the Controlling Body in England.' The 128 volumes of the Statistical Survey were expressly compiled for these purposes; and of the twelve years which have elapsed since its commencement, the first eight were devoted to that part of the work. But these 128 volumes, although by no means too elaborate for administrative requirements, are practically within the reach of but a small official class. The third object of the undertaking had been defined in my original Plan, to be 'for the use of the public;' and the remaining four years of the twelve have been chiefly occupied in reducing the voluminous records of the Statistical Survey to a practicable size for general reference. The result is now presented in the nine volumes of The Imperial Gazetteer.\n\n\\(^1\\) Under the title of *A Gazetteer of the Territories under the East India Company and of the Native States on the Continent of India.* (4 volumes.) This work, excellent at its date, was compiled between the years 1844 and 1854; Mr. Thornton being paid a sum of money by the Court of Directors in addition to his salary, 'it being distinctly understood that the copyright is to vest in the East India Company' (*Resolution of the Court of Directors*, 18th February 1846).\nPrevious Gazetteers had described, with industry and sometimes with eloquence, the famous cities of India, its historical sites, and great Provinces. But in the absence of systematic materials, they had to depend on the chance topography of tourists, or on a place happening to find its way into the records of the India House. A petty hamlet in which some traveller had halted for a night, or any locality which had formed the subject of a correspondence with the Court of Directors, stood out in bold relief; while great tracts and rivers, or the most important features of large Provinces, were passed over without a word. My first business, therefore, was to take care that every place which deserved mention should be enumerated; my second, to see that it received neither less nor more space than its relative importance demanded.\n\nWith a view to the first object, I sent circulars to the Provincial Editors and District Officers, calling for a return, upon clearly-stated principles, of every town, river, mountain, historic site, religious resort, commercial fair, harbour, or other place of importance in each District of British India. This list I checked from the Statistical Survey, and supplemented with many places which, although of no local significance, had obtained prominence in the literature of India. Eleven thousand names were thus arranged in alphabetical order. No such list had ever before been compiled for Her Majesty's Indian Empire. After being thinned out, it was printed in a folio volume, and forwarded to all the Local Governments in India, with a request that they would ascertain that the enumeration was correct as regards the territories under their care. I finally revised the list by the light of their suggestions, and selected about 8000 places for treatment in the Imperial Gazetteer.\n\nDuring the interval which elapsed before their replies could be received, I drew up model articles\nshowing paragraph by paragraph the method of treatment; and I got together the missing materials for Provinces where the Statistical Survey had not sufficiently advanced to yield them. In this way, I placed in the hand of each contributor to The Imperial Gazetteer the names of the places of which he was to treat, together with the complete materials for dealing with them, and also an exact mould into which those materials were to be squeezed.\n\nThe value of the work, as a guide to administration, is impaired by the fact that its figures cannot be brought up to date. The basis of Indian statistics is still the Census of 1872, taken a few months after my appointment as Director-General; and the Government has decided that the publication of the Gazetteer must not be delayed, with a view to obtaining the results of the new Census of 1881. Even the Census of 1872 does not supply a uniform basis for the whole of India; and in certain Provinces I have had to work on enumerations taken in 1867, 1868, 1869, and 1871. Much labour has been expended in bringing up the economic statistics to a more recent date, with the help of Administration Reports, and by special inquiries. But the length of time necessarily occupied by a Statistical Survey of a Continent, nearly equal to all Europe less Russia, rendered it inevitable that the results should refer to different years during its progress. My figures represent substantially the population statistics of India in 1872, with the administrative and trade statistics from 1875 to 1879. In some cases, even this degree of uniformity has not been found practicable; in others, I have brought the facts down to 1880. But the reduction of the statistics of India to a uniform basis must be deferred for a second edition, after the results of the new Census are obtained.\n\nIn its other aspect, as a book for general reference, the\nImperial Gazetteer is also less perfect than I could have wished in several points. The Governor-General in Council found that the task of collecting the administrative materials and statistics would prove a burden quite as heavy as he deemed expedient to lay upon the Local Governments. The historical aspects were expressly left to the voluntary research of the Provincial compilers. From the first, one of the Local Governments objected even to this moderate scope being allowed for matters not directly of an official character. The emphasis which the Governor-General in Council laid in 1875 on the responsibilities of the Provincial Governments for the tone and contents of the work, seemed to several of them to render general disquisitions unsuitable. Even in the Provinces of Bengal and Assam, which I retained in my own hands as Provincial Editor, every sheet had to receive the sanction of the Local Government before it was printed off. Many topics of social or political interest were excluded; and a general introductory volume, after being in part printed, was not issued.\n\nBut if the history of India is ever to be anything more than a record of conquest and crime, it must be sought for among the people themselves. Valuable historical materials had been collected for the Statistical Survey; and in 1877, the Secretary of State for India decided that a wider scope should be allowed me for their use in the Imperial Gazetteer. I have done my best to give effect to that view; and it will be seen, for the first time in these volumes, that every Indian District has its own history. The true territorial unit of Indian history is, indeed, much smaller than the British District. For example, he who would study the history of Oudh must search for it in the *pargan\u00e1* or parish; in other parts of India, the *zamin\u00e1rd\u00ed* or estate is the historical unit; in others, the chiefship; while in a few, the rural districts were mere appendages to the great cities. Had it been\npermitted me to subject the rural annals of India to systematic inquiry, as I wished, a rich harvest would have been gathered in. The historical accumulations made by the wayside, in conducting the Statistical Survey, have proved of much value. But in attempting to incorporate them into the Imperial Gazetteer, I have had frequently to choose between using materials which, owing to the earlier instructions, I had been unable to test; or rejecting statements, in themselves new and interesting, but which, in the later stages of the work, I could not personally verify.\n\nThe latitudes and longitudes have, with a few exceptions, been revised by the Surveyor-General's Department.\u00b9 I have to thank General Sir H. Thuillier for many years of friendly help, and Colonel J. T. Walker for more recent assistance, in the geographical details. Areas, distances, and similar details have been taken from the latest scientific measurements; but the frequent changes in the jurisdiction of Indian Districts introduce an element of variation difficult to eliminate. In some cases, averages will not work out correctly, as in the rates of local taxation per head, where the municipal area often differs from the town area taken for the census. In other instances, the items will not add up; as in certain Districts where the religious classification of the people does not yield the exact total arrived at by the general enumeration. There are not very many discrepancies of this sort, and no labour has been spared to get rid of them. But in several cases I cannot go beyond the figures supplied to me by\n\n\u00b9 The longitudes require a constant correction of minus $2\\frac{1}{2}$ minutes ($-0\u00b0 2' 30''$) to reduce them from the adopted value of $80\u00b0 17' 21''$ for the longitude of the Madras Observatory, on which they have been based, to the value of $80\u00b0 14' 51''$, which was determined electro-telegraphically in 1876-77. It is not improbable that some further minute correction may be hereafter made; and the Surveyor-General has deemed it undesirable that the values of all the individual longitudes should be altered, until the final determination has been arrived at.\nthe local authorities; and although I may see that there is something wrong, I am unable to set it right. I beg that those who may come after me will, in improving on my work, remember the conditions under which it has been done. When it was begun, no one knew exactly the population of a single Province of India, or of a single District of Bengal. In the latter Province alone, the Census of 1872 suddenly disclosed the presence of 22 millions of British subjects whose existence had never previously been suspected. The population of Bengal and Assam, up to that time reckoned at 40 millions, was ascertained in 1872 to number $67\\frac{3}{4}$ millions of souls.\n\nThe spelling of names of Indian places has long formed a subject of controversy. Without a uniform system of rendering them, an alphabetical Gazetteer could not start; and one of my first duties was to lay down a system for transliterating Indian Proper Names. In existing Gazetteers of India, the same word appears under many forms. The best work of this class gives eleven different spellings of the same town, not one of which is exactly correct; and in order to be sure of finding a place, the inquirer has to look it up under every possible disguise. The truth is, it requires a careful study of the vernacular languages of India, and some knowledge of Sanskrit, which forms the key to them, before one is able to spell local names correctly in the native alphabets. It next requires a well-considered system of transliteration in order to render such names into the English character. For it must be remembered that the Sanskrit alphabet has fifty letters or signs, while the English alphabet has only twenty-six. Thus, the Roman alphabet has but one letter for the consonant $n$; the Sanskrit has four letters for it, in its various modifications, as a dental, lingual, palatal, and guttural. On the other hand, the Indian alphabets attach a uniform sound to each vowel; while in English, the same\nvowel may have several sounds, such as \\( u \\) in *but*, *put*, *cure*, *rural*. Indian names can therefore be represented only in a loose and popular manner in our alphabet; unless, indeed, we manufacture a new Roman alphabet with additional letters, by means of accents over the vowels, dots under the consonants, italics, or similar devices of typography.\n\nA recognition of this fundamental difficulty should make an Indian spelling-reformer moderate in his aims and patient of opposition. I first collected about 15,000 names of places, written out by competent natives in the vernacular character; and transliterated them accurately on the method adopted by the Royal Asiatic Society. But the multitude of accented vowels and dotted consonants convinced me that such precision was impracticable for popular use. I therefore re-transliterated them on a more simple system, discarding dotted consonants altogether, using as few accents as possible over the vowels, and abstaining from liberties with the alphabet which would give it an un-English look, and perplex the ordinary reader. My object was, not to write a paper for the Asiatic Society's Journal, but to lay down a uniform system which might afford a practical settlement of the long dispute about Indian orthography, by being adopted by all fairly educated men.\n\nThe task was complicated by the circumstance that three systems had co-existed during nearly a century. For two of the rivals a good case might be made out. Popular usage had drawn at random from all three, and a number of important places had thus obtained an historical or literary fixity of spelling. Well-known names of this last class, when transliterated in an unwonted fashion, or by a rival method, had a strange look, which afforded scope for pleasantries. Yet one system had to be accepted and resolutely adhered to. The method which I have adopted does not attempt to represent the fine distinctions of the Sanskrit con-\nsonants, such as the dental and lingual \\(d\\). But it attaches a uniform value to each vowel, namely, \\(a\\) and \\(u\\) as in rural; \\(e\\) as in grey, m\u00e9chant; and \\(i\\) and \\(o\\) as in police. The accented \\(\u0101\\), \\(\u012b\\), and \\(\u016b\\) represent the long forms of the same vowels in Sanskrit, or the sounds in the English words far, pier, and lure.\n\nSome Indian names, however, have grown so familiar as to render a rectification of their spelling impracticable. Such names have been considerately dealt with. I found that they arranged themselves under two classes. In the first class, the popular or historical fixity of spelling had so hardened and set as to preclude any alteration whatever; thus, Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay. In the second class, it was possible to bring the spelling somewhat nearer to the uniform system, without destroying the historical or popular identity of the word. For example, the multiform terminal pur, pore, poor, poore, a city, might be uniformly given in its correct Hindi form as pur, even if the body of the word could not be rectified; while the similar termination nagar, nagore, nugger, nuggur, naggore, etc., a town, might be uniformly rendered nagar. Such a system, like all compromises, was open to the strictures of both the extreme parties\u2014of the scrupulous purists on the one hand, and of the obstinate upholders of the old confused spelling on the other. It commended itself to the intermediate body of reasonable men. The Government of India, in 1870, accordingly promulgated my system of transliteration in the Official Gazette, and formally authorized its adoption.\n\nIt remained to organize machinery for enforcing its general use. Several of the leading Indian journals expressed their willingness to adopt a uniform system of spelling which presented no typographical difficulties. Up to that time, the same place used to appear under diverse forms in the different newspapers, and was\noften variously rendered in different columns of the same journal. A printed volume containing the correct spelling of all Indian places was circulated to the Press, to literary institutions, libraries, publishing houses, and to the official Departments. But the chief sources from which Indian news is derived, and from which Indian orthography emanates, are the Government Gazettes and Administration Reports. The official Gazettes in India give much of the information which in England would be communicated by Her Majesty's Ministers to Parliament. Each Provincial Government has its own set of Reports and its own Gazette\u2014the latter sometimes swelling into a weekly folio of over a hundred pages, filled with State papers. The Governor-General requested each of the Provincial Governments to draw up a list of places within its own territories, spelt on my system. These lists, after receiving his sanction, were to be published in the Gazettes, and to be thenceforth adopted in them and all other official publications.\n\nThe Provincial Governments carried out the principles of transliteration with varying degrees of uniformity, and took widely different views as to the number of names which had obtained a popular fixity of spelling. This was inevitable; and the Governor-General in Council, in revising the lists, endeavoured to remove divergences and to attain the maximum degree of uniformity. Owing to the number of languages and alphabets used in India, the work extended over nearly ten years. The Provincial Governments have been induced to reconsider their first efforts; and in each new edition, they have approached more closely to the lines originally laid down. In one Presidency, indeed, the latest revision has advanced beyond the limits of accuracy which I had thought practicable. Throughout India, every year sees the uniform system of spelling more generally introduced; it has been accepted in the\nParliamentary blue-books at home, and is irresistibly forcing its way into the English press.\n\nMeanwhile, the Imperial Gazetteer had to march on. The Government decided that the publication of the whole work should not, in any circumstances, be delayed beyond the year 1881. The proof sheets had to pass under the revision of the Secretary of State in Council; and most of them were, accordingly, printed in 1879 and 1880. I therefore did my best to arrive at the true spelling of each name, starting from my own lists in the vernacular character, and usually accepting the Provincial lists as drawn up by the Local Governments, when they arrived in time; although not delaying the work by waiting for their final revision.\n\nIt sometimes happened that adjoining Governments adopted different renderings for the same word, such as a river or a border district; while each Government introduced variations in revised editions of its own list. If an attempt were made to introduce a uniform system of spelling proper names for all Europe, similar delays and difficulties would arise. It must be remembered, too, that India has no common alphabet, like the Roman alphabet in Europe, but a variety of local characters, which render the same word by different letters.\n\nThus, apart from the difficulty of dental and lingual forms; the commonest of all terminals, pur, a town, is spelt with a short u in Hindi and by most of the Sanskrit family of alphabets, and with a long \u00fc in the Urdu alphabet, derived from Arabic sources. Dialectal variations also play a confusing part; a universal place-name like Sivapur or Shivapur, being hardened into Sibpur in Bengal, and softened into Hiwapur in the adjoining Province of Assam. It will therefore be possible to discover instances in which the rendering of a name in the Imperial Gazetteer differs from that ultimately sanctioned by the Government of India.\nBut candid inquirers will, I hope, find the degree of uniformity which has been arrived at by the Provincial Governments and myself, more surprising than the occasional variations.\n\nI must not let this work pass from my hands without expressing my sincere thanks for the help which I have so liberally received in its preparation. It has been officially described as the only example of a national undertaking of the sort, being carried out under the uninterrupted direction of one mind, from the initial District Survey to the final alphabetical compilation in a Gazetteer. But such merits as it may be found to possess, are due in large measure to the zealous and friendly help of my fellow-workers. I feel especially grateful to the District Officers throughout India who have supplied the local materials. On their unselfish labours the fabric of this work, as, indeed, of the whole Indian administration, rests. The Provincial Compilers of the Statistical Survey, enumerated on page xii., have also my sincere thanks. In particular, the volumes of Mr. Atkinson on the North-Western Provinces; of Mr. Campbell on the Bombay Presidency; and of Mr. Rice on Mysore, form models of administrative research. Mr. Hughes' work on Sind also deserves high praise.\n\nThe condensation of the Statistical Survey of the Provinces into The Imperial Gazetteer has been conducted chiefly in England, where the cost of literary work is much less than in India. In that task I have had, at intervals, the aid of Mr. H. P. Platt, Fellow of Lincoln College; Major-General J. Clarke, formerly Commissioner in Oudh; Mr. J. S. Cotton, late Fellow and Lecturer at Queen's College, Oxford; Mr. Grant Allen, late of Merton College, Oxford; Miss Alice Betham (now Mrs. Mackenzie), sometime Acting Tutor of Girton College, Cambridge; Miss Margaret Robertson; Mr. G. Barclay, M.A.; the Rev. E. Cunningham, M.A.; Mr.\nPhilip Robinson, late Professor of History in the Government College, Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. I shall ever look back with pleasure to my connection with this able and friendly body of fellow-workers. To Mr. Cotton, and to Mr. Charles Dollman who has been my assistant throughout, I owe in a special manner my thanks.\n\nApart from the literary compilation, I have endeavoured to bring the best practical knowledge to bear upon the revision of the work. My obligations in this respect to distinguished Indian Administrators are too numerous to be specifically detailed. But I desire particularly to thank Sir William Muir, formerly Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces, for his kind revision of the article on those territories; Sir William Robinson, sometime Acting Governor of Madras, for his contributions to articles on that Presidency, and for his untiring friendly help; Sir Robert Montgomery and Sir Henry Davies, sometime Lieutenant-Governors of the Punjab; Mr. Lewin Bowring, C.B., sometime Chief Commissioner of Mysore; and General Fytche, C.S.I., sometime Chief Commissioner of British Burma, for their personal contributions to, or revisions of, the articles on the Provinces which they formerly ruled. Mr. J. H. Batten, sometime Commissioner of Kum\u00e1un and Garhw\u00e1l, supplied in chief part the articles on these Districts. Many other retired administrators have, in like manner, enriched my materials with monographs on the territories in which their life\u2019s work was done. In each of the principal articles, I have tried to get the sheets revised by the person with the largest administrative experience of the Presidency or Province. To Colonel Yule, C.B., the editor of Marco Polo, I am indebted for scholarly and most generous aid in all articles which deal with the medi\u00e6val history of India.\n\nA separate Archaeological Survey is now at work in India; but only a very small portion of its results reached me in time to be incorporated into the Imperial\nGazetteer. The existence of that Survey precluded me from independent researches within its jurisdiction. I hope, therefore, that the next edition of this work will deal more fully and accurately with Indian antiquities than it has been in my power to do. But the reader will find how deeply my pages are indebted to the Reports already issued by General Cunningham, the head of the Arch\u00e6ological Survey; and to Dr. Burgess, the Arch\u00e6ological Surveyor for Western India. Mr. W. Rees Philipps has assisted me in the revision of the Madras articles, and supplied interesting materials regarding the Christian population. Mr. Buchan, the secretary to the Royal Scottish Meteorological Society, kindly revised the section of article INDIA which deals with his branch of science. My obligations to other friends, too numerous to enumerate here, are mentioned in the body of the work. Finally, I beg to tender my thanks to their Excellencies the Viceroy of Portuguese India, and the Governor-General of French India, for their courtesy to me while visiting their territories; and for materials placed at my disposal by the chiefs of their respective administrations.\n\nI cannot close these acknowledgments without recording my sense of the fairness with which I have invariably been treated by the Governments that have had to supervise the work. Twelve years ago, I laid down the conditions which I regarded as essential for the right conduct of the enterprise, and on which I was willing to undertake it. Very deliberately, indeed not till two years afterwards, were those conditions accepted by the Supreme Government of India of that day. But it attached to them a proviso that each of the Local Governments should be responsible for the general scope and contents of the Provincial Accounts of its own territories; and the Secretary of State accepted a similar responsibility in regard to the final compilation of The Imperial Gazetteer.\nThe result was that, as already stated, every page of the twenty volumes of the Account of Bengal had to be passed by the Government of that Province, and every sheet of The Imperial Gazetteer has been submitted to the Secretary of State. But during the progress of the work, the personnel of the Local Governments has changed over and over again. More than thirty Governors or heads of administrations have ruled the Indian Provinces, while four successive Viceroys and four Secretaries of State have directed the Indian Empire. Some of these great functionaries have held decided opinions of their own on many important questions which arose in the conduct of the operations. The work, therefore, is the result of several not perfectly parallel forces. On the one hand, there was myself with a staff of fellow-workers, anxious to adhere to the Plan as originally laid down; on the other hand, there were a number of shifting Governments, local and central, some of them divergent in their views, and any one of them able to render my position difficult, and even, for a time, to impede the work.\n\nThe delicacy of the situation was enhanced by the circumstance, that many points had to be decided in my absence from the head-quarters of the Government of India. From the first, during half of each year I was visiting the Local Governments, or on circuit through the Provinces; latterly, I have been in England for considerable periods, while compiling the Imperial Gazetteer. I have to thank the Indian Governments, not only for the patience with which they have always listened to my views, but for the courteous reconsideration of decisions which they had arrived at in my absence. I undertook to see the work to an end, and I was placed in the best position for doing so. I have been enabled to examine the various Provinces of India with my own eyes, to study their local circumstances, and to travel\nover fifty thousand miles by every means of civilised and uncivilised transport.\n\nIf I have brought to a successful issue an enterprise in which abler men had failed, it is due to the support which I have thus received. The Governor-General in Council, or the Secretary of State, might at any time have simply ordered me to adopt the methods or measures which seemed to him best. Yet not only has there never been a single occasion during the twelve years in which commands have thus been substituted for argument; but orders, passed after full deliberation, have been modified or rescinded to suit what I believed to be the requirements of the work. No revision by the Indian Government could take the primary responsibility off myself. This has been generously recognised throughout; and the double supervision has never been permitted to give rise to a strain in the conduct of the undertaking. Whatever blemishes or deficiencies may be found in these volumes are due, therefore, not to the difficult double system of responsibility imposed by the Government, but to my own self, or to the fundamental conditions under which statistical inquiries have to be conducted in India.\n\nNow that the twelve years' work is over, and nothing can be added or taken away, I feel those blemishes and deficiencies acutely enough. When I started, I had two national enterprises in my mind: the *Ain-i-Akbari*, or statistical survey of India, conducted three hundred years ago by the Finance Minister of Akbar, the greatest of Mughal Emperors; and the military survey of Egypt, executed by France in the first quarter of the present century.\u00b9 The former is a masterpiece of\n\n\u00b9 Description de L'Egypte, ou recueil des observations et des recherches qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites en Egypte pendant l'exp\u00e9dition de l'arm\u00e9e Fran\u00e7aise. (36 volumes, 1821.) Twenty-one years were given to this magnificent work, four of them being devoted to local inquiries at the time of the military occupation, and seventeen being spent in working up the results.\nadministrative detail; the latter a brilliant effort of organized research. It was my hope, and the wish of the Viceroy\u2014now, alas! gone from this world\u2014who most deeply impressed his personality on the undertaking, to make a memorial of England's work in India, more lasting, because truer and more complete, than these monuments of Mughal Empire and of French ambition.\n\nThe scientific aspects of the country, its fauna, flora, and geology, already form the subject of elaborate volumes. For the most important of them, such as the fishes, botany, geology, meteorology, and medical aspects of India, special Surveys or Departments exist. It would have been improper for me to intrude upon the ground so ably occupied. I have therefore confined myself on these heads to brief but careful sketches, such as might be useful to practical administrators, and referred the scientific inquirer to the separate standard works, or to the publications of the professional Indian Surveys.\n\nI have ever borne in mind that the work has been paid for by the Indian people, and that it was primarily designed as an aid to the better government of their country. Since the authority passed from the Company to the Crown, fundamental changes have taken place alike in the central control and in the local administration. As already mentioned, the transfer of the controlling power from the Court of Directors, a small body with special knowledge of the country, to Parliament, an assembly whose members have had for the most part no opportunity of studying Indian affairs, caused the necessity for a standard account of India\n\n'La France,' says the preface, after setting forth the brilliant and numerous staff of savants who took part in the survey, 'avait r\u00e9uni tous ses efforts pour la conqu\u00eate de cette contr\u00e9e; tous les efforts des arts ont \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9s pour sa description.' The area dealt with was only a fraction of that now covered by the Statistical Survey of India; the cost of the operations was many times as great. The results were sumptuously published under an Ordonnance du Roi, dated 1820, and dedicated to His Majesty Louis XVIII., in 25 volumes of letterpress and 11 double folios of maps and illustrations.\nto be more keenly felt. No book exists, sufficiently accurate and sufficiently comprehensive, to be generally accepted as a work of reference. Contradictory assertions can therefore be safely hazarded on almost every point of Indian statistics; and Indian discussions commonly lose themselves in a wilderness of irrelevant issues.\n\nBut if a standard account of India is required for the Controlling Body in England, the altered conditions of Indian service have rendered such a work still more necessary for the local administrators. The Company's servants accepted India as their home, and generally remained a long time in one District. But under the beneficent policy of the Queen's Proclamation, the natives of India every year engross a larger share of the actual government. The English administrators are accepting their ultimate position as a small and highly-mobilised superintending staff. They are shifted more rapidly from District to District; and the new system of furlough, with a view to keeping them at the utmost efficiency, encourages them to take their holidays at short intervals of four years, instead of granting long periods of idleness once or twice in a quarter of a century's service. They have not the same opportunities for slowly accumulating personal knowledge of one locality; on the other hand, their energies are not allowed to be eaten away by rust. An officer, who had spent a dozen years in one District, might have little to learn from a printed account of it; but to the present generation of quickly changed 'officiating' functionaries, such a work is indispensable.\n\nThe thanks, gazetted and private, of the Provincial Governments prove that the Statistical Survey has fulfilled this its primary design in India. I hope that The Imperial Gazetteer will be found to answer the same purpose for the Controlling Body in Parliament, and the\nEnglish public. It furnishes, for the first time, an account of India based upon a personal survey of the country, and upon an actual enumeration of the people. I trust that it may transfer many Indian questions from the region of haphazard statement to the jurisdiction of calm knowledge. 'Nothing,' I wrote in my original Plan, submitted to the Viceroy in 1869, 'nothing is more costly to a Government than ignorance.' I believe that, in spite of all its defects, this work will prove a memorable episode in the long battle against ignorance; a breakwater against the tide of prejudice and false opinions flowing down upon us from the past; and a foundation for a truer and wider knowledge of India in time to come. Its aim has been, not literary graces, nor scientific discovery, nor antiquarian research; but an earnest endeavour to render India better governed, because better understood.\n\nFor the first time in the history of our rule, an opportunity has fallen to me of finding out the truth about the Indian people, and of honestly telling it. Whether I have used that opportunity in a worthy spirit, and whether I have succeeded in the task in which so many previous attempts have failed, it is for others to judge. Sound knowledge is of slow growth, and no intensity of effort can do in twelve years for India what centuries of local research have accomplished for Europe. But when I compare the basis for future effort created by these volumes, with the absence of any systematic materials when I commenced the work, I feel that the first and most difficult stage has been passed. If the statistical survey of the Mughal India, conducted by Akbar's Finance Minister, had afforded such a basis, it would have proved invaluable to English administrators. What would European scholars not give for a similar account of the Roman Empire! The territories dealt with in these volumes far exceed the Provinces which paid tribute to the Great Akbar, and contain a population exactly double Gibbon's estimate of\nall the nations and races that obeyed Imperial Rome. I leave the work to the charitable judgment of those who can contrast it with the efforts of Indian statists who have gone before me; I also leave it with a sure confidence that it will be improved by brethren of my Service who come after me.\n\nW. W. Hunter.\n\nApril 12, 1881.\nPREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.\n\nThe circumstances under which the Statistical Survey and the Imperial Gazetteer of India were undertaken, and the methods by which the operations have been carried out, are explained in the preface to the first edition of this work. That edition was compiled from materials collected between 1868, the year of the Punjab Census, and 1877. Its central foundation was the first attempt at a general census of India, conducted throughout the greater part of the country in 1871 and 1872. The present edition takes as its starting-point the last Census of 1881, which was also the first complete and fairly synchronous Census of India. Its administrative statistics chiefly refer to the years 1882\u20131884, but in certain of the larger questions dealt with, the facts are brought down to 1885.\n\nEvery article in the original edition has been submitted to the Provincial Governments of India, and through them to the District Officers, for criticism and suggestions. Valuable local information, received from these sources, has been incorporated; in some cases, however, without the possibility of personally testing its precision. The vast economic and social changes which are taking place in India have involved still larger additions. The rapid expansion of India\u2019s foreign trade, of her internal railway system, and of steam factories, has profoundly affected the industrial equilibrium. Old centres of commerce, old staples of produce, the old domestic hand-manufactures, have in parts of the country declined. New cities, new marts, new ports, new staples, and new manufactures by machinery,\nhave sprung up. The progress of municipal institutions and of Local Government Boards has, during the same period, tended to remodel the fabric of rural administration. In the ten years ending 1884, the latest date for which the final returns are published, the foreign trade of India increased from 102 to 157 millions sterling; Indian shipping (outward and inward) from $4\\frac{3}{4}$ to $7\\frac{1}{4}$ million tons; the number of telegrams from $\\frac{3}{4}$ of a million to $1\\frac{3}{4}$ millions; and the number of letters or articles sent through the Indian Post Office from 116 to 203 millions. During the last seven years of that period, the ascertained attendance at Indian schools rose from $1\\frac{3}{4}$ to 3 millions of pupils.\n\nSo far from representing 'the stationary stage' of civilisation, according to a former school of English economists, India is now one of the most rapidly progressive countries of the earth. An effort has been made, in these volumes, to bring out the salient features of this great awakening of an Asiatic people to Western modes of thought and to the modern industrial life. In some cases, indeed, the detailed comparisons between present and past statistics may prove wearisome to the reader.\\footnote{The considerations which have guided the selection of the years for the purposes of comparative statistics are fully explained at page 457 of volume vi.} But without such comparisons, it was not found possible to convey a clear understanding of the existing problems of Indian administration and of Indian progress.\n\nArticles which, in the first edition, were found inadequate to the needs of commercial enquirers have been amplified; or, as in the case of the HUGLI RIVER, have been rewritten from fresh investigations, conducted personally on the spot. In others, an attempt has been made to incorporate the results of researches published since the first edition appeared. Thus, in article INDIA, the chapter on Buddhism endeavours to exhibit the new lights derived from the Chinese and Tibetan records; while additional chapters on the history of Christianity in India (A.D. 190 to 1881), and on the growth of the Indian vernaculars\nand their literatures, have been written from original materials, supplied, in part, by the now completed Statistical Survey. As many of the subjects dealt with in that article are still questions of historical or scholarly discussion, rather than ascertained facts, the author's views are offered on his own responsibility, and a personal tone has been adopted which is absent from the rest of the work.\n\nBut while the present edition has thus been enriched by fresh local enquiry, it has had to encounter a peril from which the original edition was exempt. The Government deemed it expedient that, in bringing out the first edition, the author should be placed in immediate contact with the printers in England. In regard to the present edition, it was not found possible to afford the same facility for the accurate execution of the work. The time necessarily occupied in transmission of printed materials from India to England and back has precluded the possibility, save in exceptional cases, of more than a single revision of the proof-sheets. It can scarcely be hoped that twelve volumes of figures and statistics, published under these conditions, will be free from blemishes and oversights. But the author begs the reader to believe that anxious effort has not been spared to secure the utmost accuracy attainable in the circumstances.\n\nIf the result should prove not unsatisfactory, it is due in no small measure to the admirable arrangements made by the printers, and to the circumstance that the corrections inserted in the proof-sheets in India have been checked in the final revise by Mr. J. S. Cotton in England. The author has also received the valuable assistance of Mr. Charles Dollman throughout the whole process of revision; and of Mr. F. Baness (now deceased), Mr. Stanley Shaw, and Mr. D. Atkinson during stages in the progress of the work.\n\nSpecial acknowledgments are due to Babu Jaikissen Mukharji for the use of his large and excellent library at Uttarp\u00e1ra in\nH\u00fagl\u00ed District. The facilities afforded by this unique storehouse of local literature, alike in the English and the Vernacular tongues, have materially aided in the verification of statements, the avoidance of errors, and the addition of new facts. They have tended to lessen the inevitable disadvantages under which literary work has to be done in India, separated by half the globe from those great libraries of reference, which more fortunate writers in England have at their disposal.\n\nW. W. Hunter.\n\nUttarpura in Bengal,\nFebruary 1886.\nVOWEL SOUNDS.\n\na has the sound of a as in rural.\n\u00e1 has the sound of a as in far.\ne has the vowel sound in grey.\ni has the sound of i as in police.\n\u00ed has the vowel sound in pier.\no has the sound of o as in bone.\nu has the sound of u as in bull.\n\u00fa has the sound of u as in sure.\nai has the vowel sound in lyre.\n\nAccents have been used as sparingly as possible; and omitted in such words or terminals as pur, where the Sanskrit family of alphabets takes the short vowel instead of the long Persian one. The accents over i and \u00fa have often been omitted, to avoid confusing the ordinary English reader, when the collocation of letters naturally gives them a long or open sound. No attempt has been made by the use of dotted consonants to distinguish between the dental and lingual d, or to represent similar refinements of Indian pronunciation.\n\nWhere the double oo is used for u, or the double ee for i, and whenever the above vowel sounds are departed from, the reason is either that the place has obtained a popular fixity of spelling, or that the Government has ordered the adoption of some special form.\n\nI have borne in mind four things\u2014First, that this work is intended for the ordinary English reader. Second, that the twenty-six characters of the English alphabet cannot possibly be made to represent the fifty letters or signs of the Indian alphabets, unless we resort to puzzling un-English devices of typography, such as dots under the consonants, curves above them, or italic letters in the middle of words. Third, that as such devices are unsuitable in a work of general reference, some compromise or sacrifice of scholarly accuracy to popular convenience becomes inevitable. Fourth, that a compromise to be defensible must be successful, and that the spelling of Indian places, while adhering to the Sanskrit vowel sounds, should be as little embarrassing as possible to the European eye.\n\nW. W. H.\nAbar or Abor Hills.\u2014Tract of country on the north-east frontier of India, occupied by an independent tribe called the Abars. It lies north of Lakhimpur District, in the Province of Assam, and is bounded on the east by the Mishmi Hills; on the west by the Miri Hills; but it is not known how far the villages of this tribe extend north towards Tibet. The term Abar, an Assamese word, signifying barbarous or independent, is applied by the Assamese to many frontier tribes; and especially to those with whom they are least acquaint. Thus, the N\u00e1g\u00e1s to the south of Lakhimpur and Sibs\u00e1gar Districts, are divided into Abar and non-Abar N\u00e1g\u00e1s. The latter are those whose settlements adjoin the plains, and are called by the name of the Dw\u00e1r or pass through which their road runs; the former are the interior tribes, who have little or no commerce with the plains. The Abars, par excellence, however, who call themselves P\u00e1dam, occupy the tract of country defined above. They constitute two main groups, called respectively, the Bar (Bor) Abars (or \u2018Great Abars\u2019), and the Pasi-meyong Abars. The former dwell in the hilly country between the Dihang (Dihong) and Dibang (Dibong) rivers, having their chief settlement, Damloh (or Damroh) P\u00e1dam, in the high ranges to the north of the former river; the latter occupy the country between the Dihang river and the Miri Hills. The manners and customs of this people have been fully described by Colonel Dalton, in his Ethnology of Bengal. He holds that the Abars, together with the cognate tribes of Miris, Daphlas, and Akas, are descended from a Tibetan stock. The Abars are a quarrelsome and sulky race, violently divided in their political relations. In former times, they committed frequent raids upon the plains of Assam, and have been the subject of more than one retaliatory expedition. Since 1862 they have fairly observed the agreements then made with the British Government, by which they formerly received annually certain small presents of cloth, hoes, and other articles\n(commuted into a money payment since 1880), and engaged to keep the peace along their own border. In 1880-81, however, there was a threatened migration of some Abar villages from the west to the east of the Dibang, where they would command the route taken by the Mishmis to and from Sadiya. In order to prevent this movement, which it was anticipated would lead to disturbances, the Government in 1881-82 advanced a military and police guard to Nizamgh\u00e1t, on the Dibang, about 34 miles north of Sadiya. This move led to some acts of hostility on the part of the Abar village of Pado, and an attempt was made to surprise one of our patrols. The establishment of a line of outpost stations, however, checked any further aggressive movements, and since 1882 the Abars have lived peaceably in their own villages.\n\n**Ab\u00e1z\u00e1i.**\u2014Fort and village on the north-western frontier of India, in Peshawar District, Punjab, 24 miles north of Peshawar city, on the left bank of the Swat river, and 1 mile from its exit from the hills. The river, here 150 yards wide, is crossed by a ferry, and is the highest point in British territory where a ferry is stationed. The fort, which lies between Ab\u00e1z\u00e1i village and the hills, was constructed in 1852, and has been very effective in preventing raids by the Utam\u00e1n-khels and other hill tribes upon British territory. It consists of a star with six bastions, and a square keep in the centre, all constructed of mud. It is surrounded by a ditch 30 feet wide and 8 feet deep. The wall is 16 feet in height, with a thickness of 10 feet at the bottom and 4 feet at top. The garrison ordinarily consists of 100 infantry and 50 cavalry, and the armament of one 18 and one 12 pounder bronze gun. The total population of the fort in 1881, including camp servants, was 220, of whom only 7 were females. Ab\u00e1z\u00e1i village is a picturesque place of about 130 houses, well wooded, and lying on the banks of the river.\n\n**Abbott\u00e1b\u00e1d.**\u2014Tahsil of Haz\u00e1ra District, Punjab, comprising parts of the mountain valleys drained by the Dorh and Haroh rivers, together with the hill country eastward.

Lat. $24\u00b0\\ 35'37''$ N., long. $72\u00b0\\ 45'16''$ E.; 45 miles N.E. from D\u00eds\u00e1 (Deesa), and 50 miles N.N.E. from Siddh\u00e1pur. Lieutenant-Colonel James Tod, formerly Political Agent in Western R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, and well known as the author of *The Annals of R\u00e1jasth\u00e1n*, was the first European who visited Ab\u00fa, and, for practical purposes, he may be said to have discovered the place in the early part of the present century; for, as he expresses it in his *Travels in Western India*, \u2018the discovery was my own. To Ab\u00fa I first assigned a local habitation and a name, when all these regions were a terra incognita to my countrymen.\u2019 Although regarded as part of the Ar\u00e1valli range, Ab\u00fa is completely detached from that chain by a narrow valley about 15 miles across, in which flows the western Ban\u00e1s; and it rises from the surrounding plains of M\u00e1rw\u00e1r like a precipitous granite island from the sea, with a base about 20 miles in length, enclosed in a broad belt of dense jungle. The top spreads out into a picturesque plateau, about 14 miles in length and 2 to 4 in breadth, broken by fantastic peaks and surrounded by a natural wall of granite. The natural features of Mount Ab\u00fa are very bold, and the slopes, especially on the western and northern sides, extremely precipitous; on the east and south, the outline is more broken up into spurs with deep valleys between. Advantage has been taken of one of these valleys on the east side to make a cart road from Rukki Kishan to the top of the hill, about 11 miles in length, which will shortly be the main line of communication with the plains. Highest point, Guru S\u00edkar, or the Saint\u2019s Pinnacle, in the northern part of the plateau, 5653 feet above sea level. There are two marble mines on the hill, but the stone is of too crystalline and hard a texture to be worked. Ab\u00fa is the summer residence of the Governor-General\u2019s Agent for R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, and a hot-weather resort for Europeans. The ascent is made by a good road from the Ab\u00fa Road Station of the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na State Railway, on the east side of the hill, the distance from the station to the Ab\u00fa post-office being 16 miles. The station, with an English church, club, barracks, hospital, and Lawrence School, is charmingly situated near the s.w. end of the high undulating plateau, being nearly 4000 feet above sea level, and some 3000 feet above the plains below. There are two rocks near the station called the Nun and the Toad, from their curious resemblance, in outline, to a veiled woman, and to an immense toad. Loftier heights surround the station, and a beautiful little lake, about half a mile long, called Nakhi Tal\u00e1o,\u2014popularly translated the \u2018Nail Lake,\u2019 but more appropriately the \u2018Gem Lake,\u2019\u2014lies 3770 feet\nabove the sea. In 1822 Tod described this water as 'about four hundred yards in length,' and the counterpart of the lake three miles above Andernach on the Rhine. 'It is,' he writes, 'surrounded by rocks, wooded to the margin, while the waterfowls skim its surface unheeding and unheeded by man; for on this sacred hill neither the fowler's gun nor the fisher's net is known, \"Thou shalt not kill\" being the supreme command, and the penalty of disobedience, death.'\u00b9 Great changes have taken place on Ab\u00fa since then; the Nakhi Tal\u00e1o is still a beautiful sheet of water, and from different points in the walk surrounding it, delightful views are obtained. It contains a few small tree-clad islands, and a bandh or dam has recently been built across the gorge at the west end (where the overflow runs off), in order to increase the depth of the water, fears having been entertained that it might run dry, or nearly so, should an exceptionally light monsoon occur.\n\nThe eastern end of the lake towards the station is shallow and weedy, but the other portions are deep, the average depth being from 20 to 30 feet, and near the centre towards the dam, about 100 feet. But though there is now a finer sheet of water, the beauty of the lake scenery has somewhat suffered, as the wooded islands have been much submerged, and their trees nearly all killed. The fishing in the lake is inferior; there were formerly only two kinds of small fish, the singhi and gar\u00e1\u00ed, but some murrel were put in a few years ago, and other sorts might be added with advantage. Numerous otters inhabit the lake, and it is doubtful whether they would allow the fish to grow to any size. The origin of the name of the lake is doubtful. According to local legends it is said to have derived its name from its having been excavated with the nails of the gods, who dug a cave in the earth to protect themselves from the giant Mahik As\u00far, who had obtained the favour of Brahm\u00e1, by his intense worship of the deity, and had become all-powerful.\n\nIt is during and just after the rainy season that Ab\u00fa wears its most charming aspect; the streams then flow fresh and full everywhere, and ferns abound. There are also several waterfalls, that at the head of the Rukki Kishan valley below Hetamj\u00ed being especially fine after a heavy fall of rain.\n\nThe great mass of Ab\u00fa is composed of rocks of primary formation, the mountains having been formed by an upheaval of igneous granitic rocks of crystalline structure and concrete texture, consisting mainly of syenite, ill adapted for building purposes and expensive to work. The absence of limestone on Ab\u00fa is a serious inconvenience, as all lime required has to be brought from below, rendering building on the hill very expensive.\n\nThe slopes and base of Ab\u00fa are clothed with dense forests of the various trees common to the plains and to the neighbouring Ar\u00e1valli\n\n\u00b9 Tod's Travels in Western India, pp. 115, 116.\nrange, interspersed with great stretches of bamboo jungle. The plateau is well wooded in parts, but in the neighbourhood of the station many of the hills have become denuded of timber. Since 1868, however, attention has been given to forest conservancy, and the cutting and burning of trees and shrubs on the summits and upper slopes have been prohibited with beneficial results.\n\nNo complete account of the fauna of Ab\u00fa has yet been written. Of the larger carnivora, tigers occasionally stray up the mountain, and panthers and black bear are more commonly met with. The smaller beasts of prey are not numerous; hy\u00e6nas have occasionally been seen, but the jackal and fox never. The sambhar is the only deer which ascends the hill, but the spotted deer or chital is common at the base. Porcupines and hares are tolerably plentiful. Snakes are not common on the summit, the cobra and a species of viper being the only deadly snakes. The insect life during the rains is also less abundant than on the plains. Grey quail and snipe are to be seen in the cold season, but jungle fowl are scarce, and the partridge is rarely found.\n\nThe climate of Ab\u00fa throughout the greater portion of the year is agreeable and healthy. During the hot season, which commences about the middle of April, the temperature has been known to rise to $98^\\circ$ in the shade, but this is very unusual, as the thermometer seldom exceeds $90^\\circ$; and, owing to the dryness and lightness of the atmosphere and the absence of hot winds, the heat at this period of the year is not generally trying to the constitution of Europeans. The following figures give the mean temperature in the shade for each quarter of the three years ending 1880: first quarter, $62^\\circ$ F.; second quarter, $79^\\circ$; third quarter, $73^\\circ$; fourth quarter, $66^\\circ$: annual mean, $70^\\circ$. It is supposed that the temperature on Ab\u00fa has increased since the hill was first occupied as a sanitarium, owing to the reckless way in which many of the summits have been cleared of timber, and to the consequent drying up of several springs and streams at an early period of the year. The rains usually commence with thunderstorms about the middle of June. During this season fog and drizzle prevail, but the temperature is cool and pleasant, and there is none of the stifling damp heat of the plains; the climate also is healthy at this time. The rainfall is generally heavy, but not excessive, and varies greatly from year to year. The average for seventeen years ending 1880 was 68 inches. The rains usually cease as they begin, with thunderstorms, about the middle of September. There is a good deal of fever and ague, generally of a mild type, during the short interval of warmer weather following the autumn monsoon. Throughout the cold season from November to March, the climate is very healthy and bracing, and fires are required in the houses; the temperature at this time seldom falls below $40^\\circ$, and the average is $60^\\circ$. On the whole, Ab\u00fa may be considered as possessing a\ngood climate, combined with the charms of beautiful scenery. Earthquakes are frequent.\n\nPerennial springs of water on the summit of Ab\u00fa are singularly few and small, but good water can be got in almost every valley within twenty or thirty feet of the surface by sinking wells through the clay.\n\nThe civil portion of the sanitarium consists of the Residency of the Agent to the Governor-General, and forty or fifty scattered bungalows occupied by members of his staff, the Government offices, visitors, etc. The military portion affords accommodation for about 200 men, including quarters for 26 families. Like most hill stations, Ab\u00fa is nearly empty of European residents during the cold season. The most noteworthy public institution is the Lawrence School, one of several institutions in different parts of India, founded in 1854 by the late Sir Henry Lawrence, for the education of the children and orphans of British soldiers.\n\nThe permanent residents are not numerous, and consist mainly of Lok cultivators. The shopkeepers and artisans are Musalm\u00e1ns. The Cham\u00e1rs work as coolies, and do all the thatching, tiling and building. The Bhils also work as coolies, and bring grass, wood, etc., into the station. The whole population of Ab\u00fa during the summer season may be reckoned in round numbers at 4500, at other times 3500.\n\nThe crops grown on Ab\u00fa include wheat, barley, Indian-corn, pulse, rice, and a few inferior grains. Potatoes are also largely grown and exported.\n\nThe native revenue officials consist of one k\u00e1md\u00e1r for the whole of Ab\u00fa, with a n\u00e1ib under him and two th\u00e1n\u00e1d\u00e1rs, all paid by the ruler of Sirohi.\n\nIn and around the station the roads are good, and most of them adapted for light carriages; the principal one runs to the Dum\u00e1ni Gh\u00e1t, known to the residents as \u2018Sunset Point,\u2019 overlooking An\u00e1dra and the plains on the west side of Ab\u00fa. There are also several bridle-paths by means of which many of the most beautiful views on Ab\u00fa can now be enjoyed with ease and comfort. The heights of various positions on the plateau and in the station and its immediate vicinity are as follow: R\u00e1mkund peak, south of the lake, 4354 feet; Am\u00e1da Dev\u00ed peak, north of the lake, 4721 feet; church, 3849 feet; Residency, 3930 feet; Kue-k\u00e1-Pah\u00e1r, at the extreme s.w. corner of the plateau, 4598 feet; Deoli hill, 4335 feet; Bem\u00e1li peak, 4542 feet; Parok, on the south-east, 4572 feet; Achalgarh, 4688 feet; Nair\u00e1, 4686 feet; Jh\u00e1k\u00e1, 5196 feet; Nagara tal\u00e1o, 4933 feet; on the north-west the plateau is precipitous to the plains of Sirohi.\n\nIt is as the site of the most exquisite Jain buildings in the world, and as a place of pilgrimage, that Mount Ab\u00fa is celebrated. Tod styles Mount Ab\u00fa the Olympus of India. The following details are con-\ndensed, principally from an account furnished by Mr. Burgess, Arch\u00e6o-\nlogical Surveyor to the Government of Bombay. In the thirteenth\ncentury, Mount Ab\u00fa, the ancient Ar-Buddha,\\(^1\\) was held by the Parm\u00e1rs\nof Chandravat\u00ed, vassals of the old Hindu kings of Guzer\u00e1t. The site of\nChandravat\u00ed, a little to the south-east of Ab\u00fa,\u2014once a splendid capital,\n\u2014is now indicated only by mounds of ruined temples and palaces. The\nMuhammadan Sult\u00e1ns of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d first, the Th\u00e1kurs of Girm\u00e1r more\nrecently, and up to the present day the head-men to whom the chief of\nSirohi grants charge of the village, have carried away and burnt into\nlime the marble slabs, columns, and statues, so that few fragments are\nleft except such as are covered by d\u00e9bris.\n\nAlthough Ab\u00fa is not one of the greater Jain tirthas, or holy places, it\ncan boast of at least two of the most beautiful of Jain temples. These\nare at Deulw\u00e1r\u00e1, or Devalw\u00e1r\u00e1, the place of temples, about a mile north\nof the station.\\(^2\\) There are five temples in all, one of the largest being\nthree-storied, dedicated to Rishabhan\u00e1th, the first of the twenty-four\nT\u00edrthank\u00e1rs, or deified men, whom the Jains worship. The shrine,\nwhich is the only enclosed part of the Rishabhan\u00e1th temple, has four\ndoors, facing the cardinal points. The image inside is quadruple, and\nis called a Chaumukh, a not unfrequent form of this T\u00edrthank\u00e1r. On\nthe west side, the temple has a double mandap or portico, and on the\nother three sides single ones, each supported on 8 columns. The\ncorners between the domes are occupied by 6 more columns, which,\nwith the 4 columns added to each octagon to form the square, give\n16 on each quarter between the lines of entrance. Over the square\nformed by the pillars on the lines of the inner sides of the octagons,\nrise the pillars of the second story, whilst the walls of the shrine are\ncarried up to the roof. This form of temple, with its four approaches,\nample domes, and shady colonnades, is a fine type of the Jain style of\ntemple architecture, and from it, by very simple modifications, the\nother prevalent forms may easily be deduced. North of Rishabhan\u00e1th\u2019s\nChaumukh, and on a raised platform, is another large temple, without a\nspire, but with a roofed mandap, which is locally known by the name of\nBenchasah\u2019s. South-east by south from the Chaumukh is a third temple,\nenclosed by a high wall, and known as Dailak, or the temple of Ad\u00edvara\n(or Rishabhan\u00e1th) and Gorakhlanchan.\n\nTo the west of the Chaumukh stand the two finest temples of Ab\u00fa:\nthe one known as Vim\u00e1lasah\u2019s, dedicated to Ad\u00edvara, or Adin\u00e1tha,\nanother name for Rishabhan\u00e1th, the first T\u00edrthank\u00e1r; and opposite it,\non the north side, the temple of Vastup\u00e1la and Tejahp\u00e1la, dedicated to\n\n\\(^1\\) Derived from the Sanskrit Ar, mountain, and Buddh, wisdom.\n\\(^2\\) These temples are now under the management of the Committee of the Jain\nmah\u00e1jans of Sirohi, who collect the revenues, which they devote to the current\nexpenses and repairs of the temples.\nNemin\u00e1th, the twenty-second of the Tirthank\u00e1rs. The date of the former seems to be given in an inscription in which the following sentence has been read: \u2018Samvat 1088 (A.D. 1031), by the blessing of Amb\u00e1, Vim\u00e1lasah built the temple of Ad\u00edn\u00e1tha: this plate records its repair in Samvat 1379 (A.D. 1322), on Monday the ninth day of the light fortnight of Jaistha.\u2019 Several inscriptions over the shrines around the court are dated in Samvat 1245 (A.D. 1188), and record their dedication to S\u00e1ntin\u00e1th, the 16th, and Aran\u00e1th, the 18th T\u00edrthank\u00e1r, by \u2018Yasodh\u00e1v\u00e1la, of the race of Pr\u00e1gv\u00e1ta,\u2019 or his family.\u00b9 Both the temples of Vim\u00e1lasah and of Vastup\u00e1la are built of white marble, and carved with all the delicacy and richness of ornament which the resources of Indian art at the time of their erection could devise. Inscriptions fix the date of the Vim\u00e1lasah temple at 1031 A.D., and the construction of the Vastup\u00e1la edifice from 1197 to 1247.\n\n\u2018Were twenty persons,\u2019 says Mr. Fergusson,\u00b2 \u2018asked which of these two temples were the most beautiful, a large majority would, I think, give their vote in favour of the more modern one, which is rich and exuberant in ornament, to an extent not easily conceived by one not familiar with the usual forms of Hindu architecture. The difference between the two is much the same that exists between the choir of Westminster Abbey, and Henry the Seventh\u2019s chapel that stands behind it. I prefer the former, but I believe that nine-tenths of those that go over the building prefer the latter.\u2019\n\nThe temple of Vim\u00e1lasah is constructed on the usual model of Jain temples, which, though of very great variety as to size, are generally similar in plan. It consists of a shrine lighted only from the door, containing a cross-legged seated figure, in brass, of the first Jaina-Ad\u00edsvara, to whom this temple is dedicated. In front of this is a platform, which, with the shrine, is raised three steps above the surrounding court. The platform and greater part of the court are covered by a mandap, or outer portico, cruciform in plan, and supported by forty-eight columns. The eight central pillars of this porch are so arranged as to form an octagon, supporting a dome, which, together with its circular rims and richly-carved pendant, forms the most striking and beautiful feature of the entire composition. The whole is enclosed in an oblong courtyard about 140 feet by 90 feet, surrounded by fifty-five cells, each of which contains a cross-legged statue of one or other of the T\u00edrthank\u00e1rs. The door-posts and lintels of these cells or subordinate shrines round the court, are carved in most elaborate devices, with human figures interspersed with foliage and architectural ornaments of the most varied\n\n\u00b9 Asiatic Researches, vol. xvi. p. 312.\n\u00b2 Picturesque Illustrations of Ancient Architecture in Hindust\u00e1n, p. 39.

In front of these cells, and forming porticoes to them, is a double colonnade of smaller pillars, their bases standing on a platform raised three steps above the court. In a small cell in the south-west corner is the image of Amb\u00e1j\u00ed, a dev\u00ed or familiar goddess, always associated with Nemin\u00e1th. Vastup\u00e1la's temple is dedicated to Nemin\u00e1th, and as the adjoining cell also contains a colossal black marble image of the same T\u00edrthank\u00e1r, it may possibly be an indication that this shrine was likewise at first dedicated to Nemin\u00e1th. On each of the three outer faces of the central dome of the mandap, the roof is carried on tall pillars to that of the corridors in front of the cells, thus leaving two small square courts near the front corners of the enclosure, besides the open space round the central shrine, to admit light to the whole area.\n\n'Externally,' says Mr. Fergusson, 'the temple is perfectly plain, and there is nothing to indicate the magnificence within except the spire'\u2014or rather pyramidal roof\u2014'of the cell peeping over the plain wall; though even this is the most insignificant part of the erection.' 'And,' as he remarks elsewhere, 'the external porch, too, is insignificant, so that one is totally unprepared for the splendour of the interior; but I do not know anything in architecture so startling as the effect when the door is opened, and the interior bursts on the astonished traveller.'\n\nFacing the entrance is a square building supported by pillars, and containing nine statues of elephants, each a single block of white marble, about four feet in height. On each of them is (or rather was, for the Mogra, or Mughal iconoclast, has been at work here) a male figure seated on a rich howdah beside the Mahaut. They represented the Seth, or merchant, Vim\u00e1lasah, and his family, going in procession to the temple. He, however, having been carried off, an equestrian statue of him has been placed in the doorway,\u2014'a most painful specimen of modern art, made of stucco, and painted in a style that a sign-painter in England would be ashamed of.'\n\nIn Vastup\u00e1la's temple a procession similar to this, with an elaborately-carved spire resembling the later forms of the Buddhist dahgoba in the centre, occupies the place of the cells behind the shrine in that of Vim\u00e1lasah. 'It is separated from the court by a pierced screen of open tracery, the only one,' so far as Mr. Fergusson knows, 'of that age,\u2014a little rude and heavy, it must be confessed, but still a fine work of its kind. Behind it are ten elephants of very exquisite workmanship, and with rich trappings sculptured with the most exquisite precision. The \"Mogra R\u00e1j\u00e1\" has, however, carried off the riders. In this case, however, the loss is not so great, as behind each elephant is a niche containing statues in alto-relievo of those who were, or were to be, mounted on them. There are Vastup\u00e1la, with his one wife; Tejahp\u00e1la,\n\n1 Tod says this cell is dedicated to Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed (Travels, p. 106).\n2 History of Indian and Eastern Architecture, vol. ii. p. 237.\nwith two; and their uncle, who seems to have been blessed with three\u2014in short, the whole family party. The men are fine-looking fellows, all with long, flowing beards; the ladies are generally sharp-visaged, sour-looking dames' (Fergusson's Pictorial Illustrations of Architecture in Hindust\u00e1n, p. 49).\n\nThe Temple of Vastup\u00e1la and Tejahp\u00e1la stands on the north of Vim\u00e1lasah's, and is entered from the court between them by a stair near the west end of the enclosure. It contains several inscriptions in Sanskrit (Asiatic Researches, vol. xvi. pp. 284-330; Ind. Antiquary, vol. ii. pp. 255 ff.). Over the doors of the cells, or kulik\u00e1s, which surround the central fane, are 46 inscriptions recording their construction, and grants for the worship of the different images they enshrine, chiefly by Tejahp\u00e1la and his kindred, and dated from Samvat 1287 to 1293 (A.D. 1230 to 1236). The brothers Vastup\u00e1la and Tejahp\u00e1la were Porw\u00e1l\u00e1 bani\u00e1s of An\u00e1hilapattan, who served as chief ministers to V\u00edra Dhav\u00e1la, the first of the W\u00e1ghel\u00e1 dynasty of Guzer\u00e1t.\n\nThe mandap, or portico, forms one of the distinguishing characteristics of the Jain style of architecture, as well as its most beautiful feature. In most existing instances it is surmounted by a dome, resting on eight columns out of twelve, which form a square with four columns on each side, including the corners. These pillars terminate in the usual bracket capital of the East. 'Upon this,' as Mr. Fergusson describes it, 'an upper dwarf column or attic, if it may be so called, is placed to give them additional height; and on these upper columns rest the great beams or architraves which support the dome. As, however, the long bearing is weak, at least in appearance, the weight is relieved by the curious angular strut or truss of white marble, which, springing from the lower capital, seems to support the middle of the beam.' The arch formed by the two struts between each pair of columns is known as a tor\u00e1na. 'That this last feature is derived from some wooden or carpentry original,' continues Mr. Fergusson, 'can, I think, scarcely be doubted.'\n\nOn the octagon, formed by the massive marble architraves across the heads of the pillars, rests the dome, also of white marble, finished with a delicacy of detail, a richness, and an appropriateness of ornament unrivalled by any similar example either in India or Europe. A single block over the angles of the octagon suffices to introduce the circle. Above the second ornamented course, sixteen brackets are inserted, the lower sides of each being wrought into a sitting figure with four or six arms. The brackets support statues, male and female; and the spaces between are wrought with elaborate ornamentation. Above their heads is a circle of twenty-four pendants, and inside this a sort of scolloped pattern, whilst in the centre is a pendant of the most exquisite beauty. Of the ornaments, Mr. Fergusson remarks that 'those introduced by the Gothic architects in Henry the Seventh's chapel at Westminster, or at\nOxford, are coarse and clumsy in comparison.' (For a further account of the Ab\u00fa temples, with drawings and photographs, see Mr. Ferguson's valuable works, the History of Indian Architecture and Pictorial Illustrations of Architecture in Hindust\u00e1n; also a paper on Mount Ab\u00fa in the Indian Antiquary, vol. ii. pp. 249 ff., Sept. 1873; and the R\u00e1jput\u00e1n\u00e1 Gazetteer, vol. iii. pp. 145 to 150.)\n\n**Achala Basanta** *(Eternal Spring).*\u2014Peak of the Assi\u00e1 range, Cuttack District, Bengal.

School for boys attended by 71 pupils; also girls' school, with 40 pupils. Police outpost station.\n\n**Aden.**\u2014Peninsula, isthmus, and fortified town, under the Government of Bombay, on the south coast of Yemen Province, Arabia Felix. The British territory was formerly limited to the peninsula of Aden proper, and extended to the Khor Maks\u00e1r creek, two miles north of the defensive works across the isthmus. In 1868, the island of S\u00edrah (now connected with the mainland by a masonry causeway) and the peninsula of Jebel Ihs\u00e1n, or Little Aden, were acquired by purchase from the Sult\u00e1n of Lahej. In 1882, owing to the increasing population of Aden town, a further small tract of territory was acquired by purchase beyond the Khor Maks\u00e1r creek, extending to just beyond the village of Im\u00e1d on the north, and to Shaikh Othm\u00e1n on the north-west. Lat. 12\u00b0 45' N., long. 45\u00b0 4' E. The area of Aden peninsula is 21 square miles, and of Little Aden peninsula, 15 square miles, and of the newly acquired tract, 34 square miles: total, 70 square miles; population (1881), 34,860; or including the garrison and shipping, as also the island of Perim, 35,932, of whom nearly 23,000 are males. The inhabited peninsula is an irregular oval, 15 miles in circumference, with a diameter of 3 to 5 miles, connected with the continent by a neck of land 1350 yards broad, but at one place nearly covered at high spring tides. The causeway and aqueduct, however, are always above, although at certain seasons just above, water. Aden consists of a huge crater, walled round by precipices, the highest peak being 1775 feet above the sea. Rugged spurs, with valleys between, radiate from the centre. A great gap in the circumference of the crater has been rent on its sea face, opposite the fortified island of S\u00edrah, by some later volcanic disturbance. The town and part of the military cantonment are within the crater, and consequently are surrounded on all sides by\nhills. The Census return shows the area to be 116 square miles. Lavas, brown, grey, and dark green, compact, schistose, and spongy; breccias; and tufas, form the materials of this volcanic fortress; with occasional crystals of augite, sanidin, small seams of obsidian, chalcedony in the rock cavities, gypsum, and large quantities of pumice stone, of which several thousand tons are exported yearly to Bombay. The scanty vegetation resembles that of Arabia Petrea, and consists only of 94 species; the more arid forms of the Dipterygium glaucum, Caparidiceae, Risida amblyocarpa, Cassia pubescens, Acacia eburnea, and Euphorbiaceae, predominating. The harbour, Bandar Tawayih, or Aden West Bay, more generally known as Aden Back Bay, lies between the two peninsulas of Jebel Shum Shum and Jebel Ihs\u00e1n, and extends 8 miles from east to west by 4 from north to south, and is divided into two bays by a spit of land, running off half a mile to the southward of the small island of Aliyah. Depth of water in the western bay from 3 to 4 fathoms; across the entrance, $4\\frac{1}{2}$ to 5 fathoms, with 10 to 12 fathoms 2 miles outside. Bottom, sand and mud. There are several islands in the inner bay; the principal, Jazirah Sawayih or Slave Island, is 300 feet high, and almost joined to the mainland at low water. Lightship visible 10 miles. Large vessels lie off Steamer Point. At present (1881) the town of Aden consists of 5254 inhabited houses; it is nearly 1400 yards broad.\n\n**History.**\u2014Aden formed part of Yemen under the ancient Himyarite kings. It has been identified with the Eden of Ezekiel xxvii. 23, whose merchants traded \u2018in all sorts, in blue clothes, and brodered work, in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords, and made of cedar.\u2019 Aden, the \u1f08\u03c0\u03b1\u03b2\u03af\u03b1 \u03b5\u1f50\u03b4\u03b1\u03b9\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd of the Periplus, is mentioned as \u1f08\u03b4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b7\u03bd, one of the places where churches were erected by the Christian embassy sent forth by the Emperor Constantius, 342 A.D. Its position rendered it an entrep\u00f4t of ancient commerce between the provinces of the Roman empire and the East. About 525 A.D., Yemen, with Aden, fell to the Abyssinians, who, at the request of the Emperor Justin, sent an army to revenge the persecution of the Christians by the reigning Himyarite dynasty. In 575 the Abyssinians were ousted by the Persians. Anarchy and bloodshed followed. The rising Muhammadan power reached Aden ten years after the Hijirah. It became subject successively to the Umayyah Caliphs, the Abbassides (749 A.D.), and the Kar\u00e1mite Caliphs (905), until the period of Yemen independence under its own Im\u00e1ms (932 A.D.). Aden continued in the early centuries of Isl\u00e1m to be a place of flourishing commerce. It carried on a direct trade with India and China on the east, and with Egypt (and so indirectly with Europe) on the west. In 1038, Aden was captured by the Chief of L\u00e1hej, and remained under his successors till 1137. During the next three centuries it was frequently taken and retaken by the conflicting powers\nin the south of Arabia. About the year 1500, the Yemen Im\u00e1m then in possession, constructed the aqueduct of 9 miles from B\u0131r Mahait into Aden, the ruins of which exist at this day. In 1503, Aden was visited by Ludovico de Varthema; ten years later it was attacked by the Portuguese under Albuquerque, who had been charged by King Emmanuel to effect its capture. His expedition left India on the 18th February 1513, with 20 ships and 2500 sailors, and reached Aden on Easter eve. The assault was delivered on Easter Sunday. An outwork with 39 guns fell to the Portuguese; but, after a four days' bloody siege, Albuquerque was repulsed with great slaughter, and had to content himself with burning the vessels in the harbour and cannonading the town. In 1516, the Mameluke Sult\u00e1n of Egypt failed in a similar attack. Later in that year, the fortress was offered to the Portuguese under Lopo Soares d'Albergaria; but the defences having been meanwhile repaired by the native governor, it was not delivered up. About 1517 Selim I., Sult\u00e1n of Turkey, having overthrown the Mameluke power in Egypt, resolved to seize Aden as a harbour, whence all the Turkish expeditions against the Portuguese in the East, and towards India, might emanate. This project was carried out in August 1538 by an expedition sent forth by his son, Solym\u00e1n the Magnificent, under the admiral R\u00e1is Sulaim\u00e1n. The Turkish sailors were conveyed on shore, lying on beds as if sick; and the governor was invited on board the Turkish fleet, where he was treacherously seized and hanged. The Turks strengthened the place by 100 pieces of artillery and a garrison of 500 men. For a time Aden, with the whole coast of Arabia, remained under the power of Solym\u00e1n the Magnificent. Before 1551, the townsmen had rebelled and handed the place over to the Portuguese, from whom, however, it was retaken in that year by Peri Pasha, the Capidan of Egypt, and still more strongly fortified. In 1609, Aden was visited by the East India Company's ship Ascension, the captain being well received, and then thrown into prison until the governor had got as much as he could out of the ship. Next year, Admiral Sir Henry Middleton also visited Aden, and one of his ships being left behind, a similar act of treachery was repeated. About 1614, Van den Broeck arrived on behalf of the Dutch East India Company, was, as usual, well received, but obtained a hint that he had better leave, and returned unsuccessful to India. In 1618, by the desire of Sir Thomas Roe, British Ambassador to the Emperor of India, we received permission to establish a factory at Mokha. In 1630, the Turks were compelled to evacuate Yemen, and Aden passed again to the native Im\u00e1ms of that province. In 1708, the French visited the port, and in 1735 it was seized by the Abd\u00e1li Sult\u00e1n of L\u00e1hej. During the next seventy years, it formed the subject of constant struggles among various Arabian claimants. In 1802, Sir Home Popham concluded a treaty of friendship and commerce with the chief; and in 1829 the\nCourt of Directors thought of making it a coaling station, but abandoned the idea owing to the difficulty of procuring labour. Aden was attacked by the T\u00fcrkchi Bilm\u00e1s in 1833, and sacked by the Fadhlis in 1836. The Chief soon afterwards committed an outrage on the passengers and crew of a British bungalow, wrecked in the neighbourhood; and in January 1838, Captain Haines, on behalf of the Government of Bombay, demanded restitution. It was arranged that the peninsula should be ceded for a consideration to the British. But various acts of treachery supervened, and it was captured in January 1839 by H.M. steamers Volage, 28 guns, and Cruiser, 10 guns, with 300 European and 400 native troops under Major Baillie\u2014the first accession of territory in the reign of Queen Victoria. Captain Haines thus described its condition when it passed into British hands: 'The little village (formerly the great city) of Aden is now reduced to the most exigent condition of poverty and neglect. In the reign of Constantine, this town possessed unrivalled celebrity for its impenetrable fortifications, its flourishing commerce, and the glorious haven it offered to vessels from all quarters of the globe. But how lamentable is the present contrast! With scarce a vestige of its former proud superiority, the traveller values it only for its capabilities, and regrets the barbarous cupidity of that government under whose injudicious management it has fallen so low' (MS. Journal, pp. 44, 49).\n\nAden under British Rule.\u2014A stipend of 541 German crowns was assigned to the Sult\u00e1n during his good behaviour. But the Abd\u00e1li proved fickle, and in three attacks, the last in 1841, he was repelled with heavy loss. In 1844 he implored forgiveness, and his stipend was restored. In 1846, a fanatic, named Sayyid Ism\u00e1il, preached a jih\u00e1d among the neighbouring tribes, but was routed. Occasional outrages in the neighbourhood, such as atrocities on boats' crews and plunderings, have from time to time disturbed the peace; but each has been very promptly checked. The adjacent peninsula of Jebel Ihs\u00e1n, Little Aden, was obtained by purchase in 1868; an advance of the Turkish troops on the L\u00e1hej territory took place in 1872, but was withdrawn in consequence of representations made by Her Majesty's Government to the Porte. Perim, a volcanic island in the Straits of Babel-Mandeb, 1\u00bd miles from the Arabian, and 11 miles from the African coast, had been visited by Albuquerque in 1513, taken possession of by the East India Company in 1799, and finally re-occupied as an outpost of Aden in 1857. In 1839, the inhabitants numbered 6000, exclusive of the military; 15,000 in 1842; 17,000 in 1856; 19,289 in 1872; and 34,860 in 1881. The European residents and Christians now number 2595; Muhammadans, 27,022; other Asiatics, 2184. The P\u00e1rs\u00eds (236), Jains (157), and Hindus (2666) have most of the trade in their hands. The Som\u00e1l\u00eds, from the African coast, and the Arabs do the hard labour\nof the port. There are also a few Arab merchants of substance. Many of the Som\u00e1lis and Arabs have no homes, but find their meals at the cook-shops, and sleep in the coffee-houses or in the open air. The increasing pressure of the civil population upon the military town and garrison, led to arrangements being made to acquire a suitable site to locate the large number of natives among the classes who lead a hand to mouth existence, and by the purchase of the Shaikh Othm\u00e1n tract, in February 1882, the difficulty of want of room has been removed.\n\nThe food of the whole population, civil and military, is imported, Aden and the adjacent country producing not a blade of grain. Rice comes from Calcutta, Bombay, and Malab\u00e1r; jo\u00e1r (Sorghum vulgare), b\u00e1jr\u00e1 (Panicum miliaceum), and Indian corn (Zea mayz) are carried on camels from the interior. Coarse grass and the straw of jo\u00e1r and b\u00e1jr\u00e1, are brought for the horses and camels from the L\u00e1hej and Fadhli Districts in the neighbourhood. The people have an untidy and make-shift air, which contrasts with the personal cleanliness of an Indian population. This arises partly from the scarcity of water, partly from the temporary nature of their residence and out-of-door life. They earn high wages in the various employments incident to a busy entrep\u00f4t and port of transhipment. Domestic servants receive \u00a31, 10s. to \u00a33 per mensem; grooms, \u00a31; boatmen, messengers, etc., \u00a31 to \u00a31, 10s. These classes also get 3 gallons of water per day, besides their wages. Porters and day-labourers earn from 15s. upwards, according to their industry. The cost of living is high.\n\nThe Trade of Aden has immensely developed under British rule. From 1839 to 1850, customs dues were levied as in India. In 1850, the Government of India declared Aden a free port, and thus attracted to it much of the valuable trade between Arabia and Africa, formerly monopolized by Mokha and Hod\u00e1\u00edda. Customs duties are levied on spirits, wines, etc., salt, and arms. A transhipment fee of \u00a310 (Rs. 100) per chest is levied on all opium, other than of Indian growth, imported for transhipment or re-export. The average value of imports and exports during the seven years preceding the opening of the port in 1850 was \u00a3187,079; during the next seven years it was \u00a3602,820, besides inland traffic. During the next seven years ending 1864-65, the exports and imports averaged \u00a31,131,589; in 1870 they had reached \u00a31,747,543. For the year 1881-82, the total value of the sea import trade was \u00a32,107,623. The total value of the sea export trade was \u00a31,602,423. The inland trade was also considerable; the total value of camel loads that entered Aden with different articles, including fresh provisions, water, firewood, and fodder, was \u00a321,285. The total estimated value of the land import trade was \u00a3189,900, and of the land export trade was \u00a385,686. The opening of the Suez Canal has more than doubled the trade of Aden, and in 1881-82 it amounted to\n\u00a33,710,108, sea and land combined, exclusive of the value of goods transhipped. The growing importance of the port may be inferred from the steamer traffic, which in five years has risen from 894 to 1214 steamers. Of the merchant steamers in 1882, 843 were British, 88 French, 51 Austrian, 42 Spanish, 35 Italian, and 23 Dutch. During the forty-three years of British rule in Aden, therefore, the population has multiplied itself nearly six-fold, and the trade has risen from under \u00a3100,000 per annum to nearly 4 millions, or by forty-fold. Aden now forms not only the great seat of the Arabian trade with Africa, but an entrep\u00f4t and place of transhipment for an ever increasing European and Asiatic commerce. Since the opening of the Suez Canal, the visits of ships of foreign navies are becoming more frequent yearly, 61 having visited the port in 1882, necessitating a vessel of war of some size being always stationed at Aden.\n\nThe Administration is conducted by a Political Resident, two Assistant Residents, and a Cantonment Magistrate, who is also, ex officio, an Assistant to the Resident. The Resident is also Military Commandant, and is usually an officer selected from the Bombay army, as are also his Assistants. The police number 141, including two European inspectors, the cost being \u00a33550 in 1881-82, and the proportion being one policeman to 247 of the population. The cost of the water police was \u00a3464. Daily average number of prisoners (1881) in jail, 69; 50 per cent. of the offences being committed by the half-savage African Som\u00e1l\u00eds. The number of civil suits disposed of in 1881-82 was 2047, affecting \u00a38577 worth of property. Aden is politically subject to the Government of Bombay, and for legal purposes is held to be a part of India, civil and criminal justice being regulated by a special Act of the Indian Legislature. The Port of Aden, in charge of a Conservator, is regulated by the Indian Ports Act. Average annual number of letters despatched (1881-82), 190,303 (as against an average of 98,651 from 1871 to 1876); other articles, 33,848; parcels, 590; money orders paid, \u00a31444. Average annual number received\u2014letters, 150,324 (as against an average of 97,506 from 1871 to 1876); other articles, 72,440; parcels, 919; money orders issued, \u00a319,281. The realizations from sale of stamps, etc., amounted to \u00a33742. The actual revenue of Aden in 1881-82 was \u00a310,760; but, adding remittances, deposits, and the proceeds of bills, etc., the total amount was \u00a3108,160. The chief sources of revenue are excise, stamps, and salt. The municipal administration is usually conducted by the Second Assistant Resident, and defrayed from a \u2018Municipal Fund\u2019 raised by local taxes and rates, amounting in 1881-82 to \u00a37426. Expenditure in the same year, \u00a37283. \u2018The Good Shepherd Convent,\u2019 under a Mother Superior and Roman Catholic clergyman, gives shelter to emancipated slave-girls. The garrison of Aden in 1881-82\ncomprised two batteries of artillery, a battalion of the Seaforth Highlanders, a company of sappers and miners, and a Native regiment, the 22nd.\n\nClimate and Water Supply.\u2014The average temperature of Aden is 83\u00b0 F. in the shade, the mean monthly range being from 76\u00b0 in January to 91\u00b0 in June, with variations up to (and sometimes exceeding) 102\u00b0. The lulls between the monsoons in May and in September are specially oppressive. The mortality among the Europeans, although greatly increased by sick or dying men from the passengers and crews of ships, only amounts to 23 per thousand, and Aden ranks as a rather healthy station for troops; but it is a well-ascertained fact, that long residence impairs the faculties and undermines the constitution of Europeans, and even natives of India suffer from the effects of too prolonged an abode in the settlement. The climate during the north-east monsoon, or from October to April, is cool and pleasant, particularly in November, December, and January. During the remainder of the year, hot sandy winds, known as sham\u00e1l, or north, indicating the direction from which they come, prevail within the crater, but on the western or Steamer Point side, the breezes coming directly off the sea are fairly cool. During the eleven years preceding 1871, the mean annual rainfall was 2.45 inches, the largest rainfall in any of those years being 8.03 inches. In 1871 only \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of an inch fell, and during the four years 1871\u201374 the average fall was \\(3\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches. During the years 1876\u201381, the average fall of rain was 2.5 inches. The Aden rainfall may be said to vary from \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of an inch to \\(8\\frac{1}{2}\\) inches, with an irregular average of about 3 inches. Since the restoration of the tanks, commenced in 1856, they have only been filled three times, in May 1866, May 1870, and September 1877. The water supply forms, perhaps, the most important problem at Aden; but it has been found that the most reliable means of supply is by condensing, and but little is now drawn from the wells and aqueducts. It is obtained from four sources\u2014wells, aqueducts, tanks or reservoirs, and condensers. The following description is abridged from a Report by Captain F. M. Hunter, First Assistant Resident, dated 1877:\n\n(1.) Wells.\u2014These may be divided into two classes, within and without British limits.\n\nWater of good quality is found at the head of the valleys within the crater, and to the west of the town, where wells are very numerous; they are sunk in the solid rock to the depth of from 120 to 190 feet; in the best the water stands at a depth of 70 feet below sea level. The sweetest is the Banian Well, situated near the Khuss\u00e1f valley; it yields a daily average of 2500 gallons; the temperature of the water is 102\u00b0 Fahrenheit, the specific gravity .999, and it contains 1.16 of saline matter in 2000 gallons.\nClose to the village of Shaikh Othm\u00e1n, and on the northern side of the harbour, there is a piece of neutral ground, nominally British property, and called the Hiswah, where the bed of a mountain torrent meets the sea. After very heavy rains on the neighbouring hills, the flood occasionally empties itself into the harbour by this outlet. From wells dug in the watercourse, a limited supply of water may always be obtained. It is brought over to the southern side of the bay in boats, and it is also conveyed in leather skins on camels round by land across the isthmus into the settlement. Water of a fair quality is also obtained from wells in the village of Shaikh Othm\u00e1n, and is carried into Aden by land on camels. During the hot season, these Hiswah and Shaikh Othm\u00e1n wells yield no inconsiderable portion of the quantity of water used by the civil population, as may be gathered from the fact that in the year 1881\u201382, 63,080 camel-loads of water, or upwards of 3,154,500 gallons, passed the barrier gate.\n\n(2.) Aqueduct.\u2014In the year 1867, the British Government entered into a convention with the Sult\u00e1n of L\u00e1hej, by which they obtained permission to construct an aqueduct from two of the best wells in the village of Shaikh Othm\u00e1n, seven miles distant. The water is received inside the fortifications into large reserve tanks, and it is thence distributed to the troops and establishments, and also to the public in limited quantities, at one rupee per 100 gallons. This water is of an indifferent quality, and is only fit for the purposes of ablution. The Sult\u00e1n of L\u00e1hej has recently sold the territory through which the aqueduct passes, and has commuted his share of the profits for a monthly payment of Rs. 1200 or \u00a3120. The aqueduct cost \u00a329,693 to construct, and the original intention was to extend the work up to Dar\u00e1b, eight miles farther inland. This latter place is situated on the bank of the torrent, the outlet of which, on the northern side of the harbour, has been already referred to, and the object was to take advantage of the rainfall in the months of May, June, July, August, and September, on the hills some twenty miles farther inland, before the thirsty sands had time to drink it up.\n\n(3.) Tanks or Reservoirs (see Playfair\u2019s History of Yemen).\u2014The expediency of constructing reservoirs in which to store rain-water, was recognised in Arabia at a very early date. They are generally found in localities devoid of springs, and dependent on the winter rains for a supply of water during the summer months. The most remarkable instance on record is the great dam at Mareb, assigned to 1700 B.C. (?). Travellers who have penetrated into Yemen describe many similar works in the mountainous districts, while others exist in the islands of Said-ud-d\u00edn, near Zaila; in Kotto in the Bay of Amphilla; and in Dhalak Island, near Massowah.\n\nThose in Aden are about fifty in number, and, if entirely cleared\nout, would have an aggregate capacity of nearly thirty million imperial gallons.\n\nThere is no trustworthy record of the construction of these reservoirs, but they are supposed to have been commenced at the time of the second Persian invasion of Yemen, *circa* 600 A.D. They cannot be attributed to the Turks. The Venetian officer who described the expedition of the Rais Sulaim\u00e1n in 1538, when Aden was first conquered by the Turkish nation, says: 'They (the inhabitants of Aden) have none but rain-water, which is preserved in cisterns and pits 100 fathoms deep.' Ibn Bat\u00fata also mentions the tanks as the source of the Aden water supply in his day (*circa* 1330). Mr. Salt, who visited Aden in 1809, describes the tanks as they then existed:\u2014'Amongst the ruins some fine remains of ancient splendour are to be met with, but they only serve to cast a deeper shade over the devastation of the scene. The most remarkable of these reservoirs consists of a line of cisterns situated on the north-west side of the town, three of which are fully eighty feet wide and proportionately deep, all excavated out of the solid rock, and lined with a thick coat of fine stucco, which externally bears a strong resemblance to marble. A broad aqueduct may still be traced which formerly conducted the water to these cisterns from a deep ravine in the mountain above; higher up is another, still entire, which at the time we visited it was partly filled with water.'\n\nWhen Captain Haines, then engaged in the survey of the Arabian coast, visited Aden in 1835, some of the reservoirs appear to have been still in a tolerably perfect state. Besides the tanks built high up on the hills, several large ones were traceable round the town. But the necessary steps not having been taken to preserve them from further destruction, they became filled with d\u00e9bris washed down from the hills by the rain. The people of the town carried away the stones for building purposes, and, with the exception of a very few which could not be easily destroyed or concealed, all trace of them was lost, save where a fragment of plaster, appearing above the ground, indicated the supposed position of a reservoir, believed to be ruined beyond the possibility of repair.\n\nIn 1856, the restoration of these magnificent public works was commenced, and thirteen have been completed, capable of holding 7,718,630 gallons of water. It is almost impossible to give such a description of these extraordinary walled excavations as would enable one who has not seen to thoroughly understand them. Trees have now been planted in their vicinity, and gardens laid out, making the only green spot in the Settlement. The Shum-Shum (*Shams-sh\u00fan*) hills, which form the wall of the crater, are nearly circular; on the western side the rainfall rushes precipitously to the sea, down a number of long narrow valleys unconnected with each other; on the\ninterior or eastern side, the hills are quite as abrupt, but the descent is broken by a large table-land occurring midway between the summit and the sea level, which occupies about one-fourth of the entire superficies of Aden. The plateau is intersected by numerous ravines, nearly all of them converging into one valley, which thus receives a large proportion of the drainage of the peninsula. The steepness of the hills, the hardness of the rocks, and the scantiness of the soil upon them, combine to prevent absorption; and thus, a very moderate fall of rain suffices to send down the valley a stupendous torrent of water, which, before reaching the sea, not unfrequently attains the proportions of a river. To collect and store this water, the reservoirs have been constructed. They are fantastic in shape. Some are formed by a dyke built across the gorge of a valley; in others, the soil in front of a re-entering angle on the hill has been removed, and a salient angle or curve of masonry built in front of it; while every feature of the adjacent rocks has been taken advantage of and connected by small aqueducts, to ensure that no water is lost. The overflow of one tank has been conducted into the succeeding one, and thus a complete chain has been formed. In 1857, when only a very small proportion of the whole had been repaired, more water was collected from a single fall of rain on the 23rd October than the whole of the wells yield during an entire year. It is manifest, however, that a large city could never have entirely depended on this precarious source of supply; and the Sovereign of Yemen, Abdul-Wah\u00e1b, towards the close of the 15th century, constructed an aqueduct to convey the water of the Bir Mahait (Playfair says 'Bir Hameed') into Aden. The ruins of this magnificent public work exist to the present day.\n\nThe restoration of the tanks, including repairs, had cost about \u00a337,000 up to the 31st March 1874. When there is water in the tanks, the condenser in the crater, where the larger portion of the troops are stationed, is not worked. The water collected, besides being issued to the troops, is also sold to the public at one rupee per 100 gallons. But when the rain fails and the tanks are exhausted, a skin containing 5 gallons of brackish water has at times sold for 8 annas, or nearly one shilling.\n\n(4.) Condensers.\u2014Shortly before the opening of the Suez Canal, Government foresaw the necessity of obtaining a plentiful and unfailing supply of good water, and in 1867, several condensers, on the most approved principle, were ordered from England. A brisk trade in distilled water sprang up, and six condensers are now worked, by the Government and private companies, capable of yielding 52,000 gallons per diem, or a sufficient supply for 10,400 Europeans at 5 gallons per head. In 1881-82, condensed water was sold at the following rates, excluding carriage:\u2014\nIsthmus, Rs. 2. 0. 4 (say 4s. 0\u00bdd.) per 100 gallons.\nSteamer Point, I. 12. 3 (,, 3s. 6\u00bdd.) ditto.\nCamp, I. II. 6 (,, 3s. 5d.) ditto.\n\nThe cost of working the condensers in 1881-82 was \u00a36090.\n\nThe Fortifications of Aden are now of a character commensurate with the importance of the place. But details regarding them would be unsuitable in this work.\n\nThe Arab tribes with whom we have to deal at Aden are the following, viz.:\n\nThe Abd\u00e1li, inhabiting a district lying in a north-north-westerly direction from Aden, called L\u00e1hej, about 33 miles long and 8 broad. Al Hautah, the capital, where the Sult\u00e1n resides, is situated about 21 miles from the Barrier Gate. The population of this district is about 15,000. The Abd\u00e1lis are the most civilized but least warlike of all the tribes in south-western Arabia.\n\nThe Fadhli, inhabiting two large districts, with a seaboard of 100 miles extending eastward from the boundary of the Abd\u00e1li. Shograh, their chief seaport, is situated 60 or 70 miles from Aden. The Fadhlis are proud, warlike, and independent. Their number of fighting men is about 6700.\n\nThe Akr\u00e1bi, inhabiting a district, the coast line of which stretches from Bir Ahm\u00e1d to Ras Amr\u00e1n. This tribe have a high reputation for courage.\n\nThere are other tribes, but as they do not reside in the immediate vicinity of Aden, it is unnecessary to refer to them. The Arab chiefs in the neighbourhood are nearly all stipendiaries of the British Government.\n\nThe language of the Settlement and country is Arabic, but other Asiatic tongues, as Urdu, Persian, Guzerathi, Sindhi, etc., as well as several European languages, are spoken and understood.\n\n[An admirable monograph has been written on Aden by Captain F. M. Hunter, under the title of the Aden Gazetteer, 232 pages, Tr\u00fcbner & Co., London, 1877. The present article has been condensed chiefly from Captain Hunter's volume.]\n\nAdevi Av\u00falapalli.\u2014Mountain, Cuddapah District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 13\u00b0 28' 27\" N., long. 78\u00b0 26' 35\" E.\n\nAd\u00edna Masjid.\u2014Celebrated ruined mosque in Panduah (Paruah) town, Maldah District, Bengal. One of the most remarkable surviving specimens of Path\u00e1n architecture.\u2014See PANDUAH.\n\nAdjai (Ajaya, 'The Invincible').\u2014A river of Bengal, rises on the boundary between the Districts of Haz\u00e1r\u00edb\u00e1gh, Monghyr, and the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s, and, after draining the south-western portion of the latter District, follows a winding south-easterly course, forming the boundary line between Bardw\u00e1n and Bimbh\u00fam as far as the village of Bhedi\u00e1,\nwhere it assumes a due easterly direction until it joins the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed just north of Katw\u00e1. During the rains, the river is sometimes navigable by cargo boats as far as the point where it enters Bardw\u00e1n District from the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s; at other seasons it is fordable throughout its course. There is a ferry at Sankh\u00e1i on the road from Bardw\u00e1n to B\u012brbh\u00fam. The Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed and the Adjai frequently overflow their banks, causing considerable damage to the crops on the neighbouring lands. To protect the country to some extent from these floods, embankments of an aggregate length of 22 miles have been raised at three different points on the right bank of the Adjai, and an embankment 3 miles long has also been constructed on the left bank.\n\nPrincipal tributaries:\u2014In the Sant\u00e1l Pargan\u00e1s are the Darua, the Patro and the Jainti; in B\u012brbh\u00fam, the Hingl\u00e1 nadi; and in Bardw\u00e1n, the Tun\u00ed and Kun\u00far nadi's. The produce of the rich valley of the Adjai in B\u012brbh\u00fam District now finds its way to Calcutta and the other markets of Bengal via the Bolpur Station of the East India Railway. This station has rapidly grown into the most important railway centre in B\u012brbh\u00fam.\n\n**Adjunta.**\u2014Village and cave temples, Nizam\u2019s Dominions. See Ajanta.\n\n**Adoni.**\u2014T\u00e1luk, Bellary District, Madras Presidency. Area, 503,680 acres (787 square miles), chiefly under \u2018dry\u2019 cultivation; population (1881), 122,085, or 155 to the square mile, dwelling in 2 towns, and 192 villages, and occupying 23,272 houses, 14 per cent. of the whole being Muhammadans. Land revenue demand (1882), \u00a318,224; 1 civil and 3 criminal courts; strength of police 100 men, distributed at 10 stations. The language spoken is a mixture of Tel\u00fagu and Canarese; Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed is used by the Musalm\u00e1ns. The assessment on irrigated land (nunja) varies from 2s. to \u00a31, 4s. od. per acre, and on dry land (punja) from 3d. to 6s. per acre. An additional rate of 10s. per acre is charged on the lands watered by the Tungabhadra channel. This channel irrigates an area of 965 acres, assessed at \u00a3937, and from which a second crop is always obtained. The only important tanks in the t\u00e1luk are those at Chikka-Tumb\u00e1lum, and Halhervi, which together irrigate 1342 acres, assessed at \u00a3815. Among the non-agricultural population, weaving forms the chief occupation, the Adoni fabrics being highly thought of throughout the Presidency. There is a large export of silk and cotton cloths. The chief towns are Adoni, Kosgi, Kavut\u00e1l, Nagaldinna, and Emmigan\u00far; six others, Hatchalli, Halhervi, Kot\u00e1kal, G\u00fadkal, Hiss\u00e1rmurvani, and Nand\u00e1varam, have each over 2000 inhabitants. No other t\u00e1luk in the District has so many large places. The Madras railway passes through the t\u00e1luk, and there is one metalled road, the highway from Bellary to Sikandar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Secunderabad).\n\n**Adoni (Adw\u00e1n\u00ed).**\u2014Town in the Adoni t\u00e1luk, Bellary District, Madras\nPresidency. Lat. $15^\\circ 37' 30''$ N., long. $77^\\circ 19' 10''$ E. The second largest town in the District, having a population (1881) of 22,441; namely, Muhammadans, 8235; Hindus, chiefly of the Vall\u00e1lar and Kaikalar castes, 14,129; and Christians, 67; houses, 3750. Cloth of cotton and silk (the latter made from the Collegal cocoons), and carpets constitute its chief manufactures, and occupy more than a third of the total adult male population. The municipal revenue amounted in 1881-82 to \u00a31608; the incidence of taxation, including tolls, being 1s. 3d. per head. Adoni is distant from Madras 307 miles, and from Bellary 66 miles, and has been connected by rail with both towns since 1870, in which year a station was opened here. Good roads run to Guti (Gooty), Bellary, Kurn\u00fal, and Sirag\u00fapa, while numerous country roads converging on Adoni, act as feeders to the railway. Cholera used at one time to be frequently epidemic here, but, owing to recent municipal reforms in street-widening, cleansing, and sanitation, the health of the town has of late improved greatly. The allotment for sanitary purposes in 1880-81 was \u00a3570. Death-rate, 21 per 1000, and birth-rate 24\u00b74 per 1000 of population included within municipal limits. The fort of Adoni, now in ruins, stands upon five rocky granite hills to the north-west of the town, two of the peaks known as Bar\u00e1kila and T\u00e1l\u00edb\u00fanda, rising to a height of 800 feet above the plain. Half way up is a fine tank of drinking water. On the summit of the T\u00e1l\u00edb\u00fanda, is a fig-tree standing alone, which is visible for 20 or 30 miles from every direction, and is an excellent landmark. The t\u0101hsild\u00e1r of the t\u00e1luk holds his court here, and the town has also a dispensary, telegraph and post offices, and a Deputy Collector's court.\n\nAdoni, as the capital of an important frontier tract in the fertile Do\u00e1b of the Kistna and Tungabhadr\u00e1, played a conspicuous part in the intestine wars of the Deccan. Traditions allege that it was founded in 1200 B.C. by Chandra Sen, in the reign of Bhim Singh, ruler of B\u00edd\u00e1r (Beder). Subsequently it was absorbed by the Vijay\u00e1nagar R\u00e1j\u00e1s; and when, in 1564, that dynasty fell by the defeat at T\u00e1l\u00edkot, Adoni became a stronghold of the Muhammadan kings of the Adil Sh\u00e1hi dynasty of Bijapur and Golkonda. They added to its strength by building the lower forts and the outer walls. The revenue of the District, of which this fortress was the centre, amounted then to '675,900 pagodas,' and the military establishment consisted of 4000 horse and 8000 foot. Ferishta refers to it as 'situate on the summit of a high hill, and containing many lakes and fountains of sweet water, with princely structures.' In 1690 it was taken after a determined resistance by the generals of Aurangzeb, and included in the Governorship of Bijapur. As the central authority of Delhi declined, Bijapur was merged in the territories of the Niz\u00e1m, and the fortress and province of Adoni became a family fief of a younger branch of the house.\nThus, in 1748 it was held by Muzaffar Jang, and on his death (1752) it descended, through the influence of M. Bussy, to his son. In 1757, it passed to Bas\u00e1lat Jang, the brother of the Subahd\u00e1r of the Deccan, who, making it his capital, attempted to establish an independent principality. Haidar Al\u00ed twice attacked the fortress without success, and though in 1778 he defeated the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s under its walls, and in the following year laid waste the country round, it did not surrender. In 1782 Bas\u00e1lat Jang died, and Haidar Al\u00ed soon afterwards. In 1786, Tipu, by a siege of a month, took the fort and razed its battlements. After the peace, Adoni was restored to the Niz\u00e1m, and in 1799 was ceded to the English.\n\n**Adrampet** (*Adrampatnam, Adiv\u00edra R\u00e1mapatnam* in T\u00e1mil: \u2018The city of the great hero R\u00e1m\u00e1\u2019).\u2014Seaport in the Pattukotta t\u00e1luk, Tanjore District, Madras Presidency.

Of the inland trade, fish forms an important item, being sent from the coast as far as to Trichinopoli. A large (Government) salt manufacture also exists here, the salt marsh lying between the town and Point Calimere, being one of the most extensive in the Presidency, and producing salt of superior quality. The average annual revenue from this salt marsh amounts to about \u00a315,000. The sharp angle of the coast immediately above it, protects the port from the north-east monsoon, while Ceylon on the south-east, protects it from the violence of the gales from that quarter. The Grand Trunk Road, on which it is situated, connects it with the principal coast towns, while the District road affords communication with the chief places inland. Post-office, customs and salt stations.\n\n**Adur or Audur.**\u2014Sometimes applied to an estate, but properly the name of a family, who are K\u00e1valgars of certain villages in Nellore District, Madras Presidency. The Adur chiefs enjoyed, under the police system of native rule, the privileges of \u2018Men K\u00e1valgars,\u2019 i.e. anciently leaders of professional robber gangs, with rights of black-mail over certain clusters of villages. Under the title of \u2018Men K\u00e1valgars,\u2019 they were recognized by successive rulers as a police, and were subsidized to abstain from or prevent depredations. They were subordinate to the Poligars, who were held answerable for the \u2018Men K\u00e1valgars\u2019 within their limits.\n\n**Adyal.**\u2014Town in Sakoli tahs\u00edl, Bhand\u00e1ra District, Central Provinces. Population (1881) 3092; namely, Hindus, 2793; Muhamm\u00e1dans, 108; Jains, 11; and aboriginal tribes, 107.\n\n**Aeng.**\u2014River and town in British Burma.\u2014See AN.\n\n**Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n** is the name applied, originally in Persian, to the\nmountainous region between North-Western India and Eastern Persia, of which the Afgh\u00e1ns are the most numerous and the predominant inhabitants. This extensive application of the term Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n, is scarcely older than the short-lived empire founded by Ahmad Kh\u00e1n in the middle of the last century. The Afgh\u00e1ns themselves are not in the habit of using it. Their territories lie beyond British India, but some account of them will be useful to many who have to consult this book. It is, however, necessary to explain that no official authority attaches to the account contained in this article, the materials for the preparation of which are obtained from information already available to the public. With the kind permission of Colonel Henry Yule, C.B. (the author), and of Messrs. A. & C. Black (the publishers), this article is partly condensed from that on Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n in the ninth edition of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, by far the ablest and most systematic account of the country yet published. I have also added information derived from more recent travellers and surveys. The following notice includes the Haz\u00e1ra mountains, but not that part of the Oxus basin which is now under Afgh\u00e1n rule, and which will be treated of separately as Afghan-Turkistan.\n\nAfgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n Proper forms a great quadrilateral tract of country, extending from about 61\u00b0 to 71\u00b0 E. long., and from 30\u00b0 to 35\u00b0 N. lat. This territory corresponds fairly to the aggregate of the ancient provinces of Aria (Her\u00e1t), Drangiana (Seist\u00e1n), the region of the Paropamisadae (K\u00e1b\u00fal), and Arachosia (Kandah\u00e1r), with Gandaritis (Pesh\u00e1war and Yuzufz\u00e1\u00ed). Though the last territory belongs ethnically to Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n, an important part of it now forms the British District of Pesh\u00e1war, whilst the remainder acknowledges no master.\n\nBoundaries.\u2014The boundaries of Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n can be stated here only in rough geographical outline, and from the area thus broadly defined, many portions will have to be deducted, being occupied, as they are, by independent or semi-independent States and tribes, who owe no allegiance to the Amir. Subject to this understanding, the boundaries may be thus given:\n\nOn the north: beginning from the east, the great range of the Hindu Kush, a western offshoot of the Him\u00e1layas, parting the Oxus basin from the Afgh\u00e1n basins of the K\u00e1b\u00fal river and the Helmand. From long. 68\u00b0 this boundary continues westward, in the prolongation of the Hindu Kush, called Koh-i-B\u00e1b\u00e1. This breaks into several almost parallel branches, enclosing the valleys of the Har\u00ed-rud or river of Her\u00e1t, and the Murgh-\u00e1b or river of Merv. The half-independent Haz\u00e1ra tribes stretch across these branches and down into the Oxus basin, so that it is difficult here to assign a boundary. It is assumed to continue along the range called Safed Koh or \u2018White Mountain,\u2019 which parts the Her\u00e1t river valley from the Murgh-\u00e1b.\nOn the east: the eastern base of the spurs of the Sulaim\u00e1n and other mountains which limit the plains on the right bank of Indus, and the lower valleys opening into them; the said plains (the 'Der\u00e1j\u00e1t') and lower valleys belonging to British India. North of Pesh\u00e1war District the boundary is, for a space, the Indus; thereafter the limit lies in unknown country, between the Afgh\u00e1n and Dard tribes.\n\nOn the south: the eastern part of the boundary, occupied by practically independent tribes, Afgh\u00e1n and Bal\u00fach, is hard to define, having no marked natural landmarks. But from the Sh\u00e1l territory (long. 67\u00b0), belonging to the Bal\u00fach State of Khel\u00e1t, westward, the southern limits of the Helmand, as far as the lake of Seist\u00e1n to a peak called Kuh Malik-i-Siyah, in lat. 30\u00b0 and long. 60\u00b0 40', complete the southern boundary. Thus, the whole breadth of the Bal\u00fach country, the ancient Gedrosia, a dry region occupying 5 degrees of latitude, intervenes between Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n and the sea.\n\nThe western boundary runs from Kuh Malik-i-Siyah north-eastward to a point near Nad\u00e1li on the Helmand, so as to exclude a part of the plain of Seist\u00e1n on the further bank of the lake, and then bending westwards, crosses the lake to near the meridian of 61\u00b0. Thence it runs nearly due north, along this meridian to a point on the Har\u00ed-r\u00fad, or river of Her\u00e1t, about 70 miles from that city, where it encounters the spurs of the Safed Koh, which have been given as the northern boundary.\n\nBut if the limits of the entire Afgh\u00e1n dominions are taken as they are at present supposed to exist, the western boundary will continue north along the Har\u00ed-r\u00fad to Sarakhs, in lat. 36\u00b0 30', and the northern boundary will run from this point along the borders of the T\u00farkom\u00e1n desert, so as to include Andkhoi, up to Khoj\u00e1 S\u00e1leh ferry on the Oxus. The Oxus, to its source in the Great P\u00e1m\u00edr, forms the rest of the northern boundary. These enlarged limits would embrace the remainder of the Haz\u00e1ra mountain tracts, and the whole of what is now called Afgh\u00e1n T\u00fark\u00edst\u00e1n, as well as Badakhsh\u00e1n with its dependencies. Bhagis is included within, while Bajour and Sw\u00e1t are excluded from Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n.\n\nThe extreme dimensions of Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n, as at first defined, are about 750 miles from east to west, and about 450 miles from north to south; and if we take the external limits of the whole Afgh\u00e1n dominion, the extent from north to south will be increased to about 600 miles.\n\nThe whole country, excepting parts of the K\u00e1bul valley, and a triangle roughly defined by the positions of Kandah\u00e1r, Her\u00e1t, and the Seist\u00e1n Lake, and a small part bordering the desert on the north-west, has an elevation of more than 4000 feet above the sea, and vast regions lie upwards of 7000 feet.\n\nNatural Divisions.\u2014(1.) The K\u00e1bul basin; (2.) the lofty central part of the table-land on which stand Ghazn\u00ed and Kil\u00e1t-i-Ghilz\u00e1i\nembracing the upper valleys of ancient Arachosia); (3.) the upper Helmand basin; (4.) the lower Helmand basin, embracing Girishk, Kandah\u00e1r, and the Afgh\u00e1n portion of Seist\u00e1n; (5.) the basin of the Her\u00e1t river; and (6.) the eastern part of the table-land, drained by streams, chiefly occasional torrents, flowing towards the Indus.\n\nThe K\u00e1b\u00fal basin has as its northern limit the range of the Hindu Kush; a name which properly applies to the lofty snow-clad crest due north of K\u00e1b\u00fal, and perhaps especially to one pass and peak. But it has been conveniently extended to the whole line of alpine watershed, stretching westward from the southern end of P\u00e1m\u00edr, and represents the Caucasus of Alexander's historians. Its peaks throughout probably rise to the region of perpetual snow, and even on most of the passes beds of snow occur at all seasons, and on some, glaciers. No precise height has been stated for any of its peaks, but the highest probably attain to at least from 20,000 to 25,000 feet. The height of the Kushan Pass is estimated by Lord at 15,000 feet; all the passes, some 20 in number, are near, or over, 12,000 feet.\n\nRivers.\u2014The K\u00e1b\u00fal river (the ancient Kophes) is the most important river of Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n. It may be considered as fully formed about 30 miles east of K\u00e1b\u00fal, by the junction thereabouts of the following streams:\u2014(a.) The K\u00e1b\u00fal stream, rising in the Un\u00e1i Pass towards the Helmand, which, after passing through the city, has been joined by the Logar river, flowing north from the skirts of the Ghilz\u00e1i plateau. (b.) A river bringing down from the valleys of Ghorband and Panjsh\u00edr a large part of the drainage of the Hindu Kush, and watering the fruitful plain of D\u00e1man-i-Koh (the 'Hill-skirt'), intersected by innumerable brooks and studded with vineyards, gardens, and fortalices. This river was formerly called B\u00e1r\u00e1n, a name apparently obsolete, but desirable to maintain. (c.) The river of Tagao, coming down from the spurs of the Hindu Kush on the K\u00e1f\u00edr borders.\n\nAbout 30 miles farther east, the Alishang enters the K\u00e1b\u00fal on the left bank, from Laghm\u00e1n, above which the Alishang drains western K\u00e1f\u00edrist\u00e1n. Twenty miles farther, and not much beyond Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d, the K\u00e1b\u00fal receives from the same side a confluent entitled, as regards length, to count as the main stream. In some older maps this bears the name of K\u00e1ma, from a place near the confluence, and in more recent ones K\u00fanar, from a district on its lower course. Higher up it is called the river of K\u00e1shk\u00e1r, also the Beil\u00e1m. It seems to be the Choaspes, and perhaps the Malamantus of the ancients. It rises in a small lake near the borders of P\u00e1m\u00edr, and flows in a south-west direction through the length of K\u00e1shk\u00e1r or Chitr\u00e1l, a State whose soil lies at a height of 6000 to 11,000 feet. The whole length of the river to its confluence with the K\u00e1b\u00fal river cannot be less than 300 miles, or considerably longer than that regarded as the main stream, measured to its\nmost remote source. The Landai, an important tributary, joins near Peshawar, bringing in the Sw\u00e1t (Soastus), and waters of Bajaur.\n\nThe basin of the K\u00e1b\u00fal river is divided by the Paghm\u00e1n range, an offshoot of the Hindu Kush, from the Helmand. The road to T\u00farkist\u00e1n leads up to the head waters of the stream that passes K\u00e1b\u00fal, crossing for a brief space into the Helmand basin by the easy Pass of Un\u00e1i (11,320 feet), and then over the Koh-i-B\u00e1ba, or western extension of the Hindu Kush, by the Hajjikh\u00e1k Passes (12,190 and 12,900 feet), to B\u00e1mi\u00e1n.\n\nThe most conspicuous southern limit of the K\u00e1b\u00fal basin is the Safed Koh, Spin-gar of the Afgh\u00e1ns ('White Mountain,' not to be confounded with the western Safed Koh already named), an alpine chain, reaching in its highest summit, S\u00edk\u00e1rram, to a height of 15,620 feet, and the eastern ramifications of which extend to the Indus at and below Attock. Among the northern spurs of this range are those formidable passes between K\u00e1b\u00fal and Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d, in which the disasters of 1841-42 culminated, and the famous Khaibar (Khyber) Passes between Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d and Peshawar. This southern watershed formed by the Safed Koh, is so much nearer the K\u00e1b\u00fal river than that on the north, that the tributaries from its northern side, though numerous, are individually insignificant. The K\u00e1b\u00fal finally enters the Indus above the gorge at Attock.\n\nThe lowest ford on the K\u00e1b\u00fal river, near Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d, is a bad one, and only passable in the dry season. Below the K\u00fan\u00e1r confluence, the river is deep and copious, crossed by ferries only, except at Naushera (Nowshera), below Peshawar, where there is usually a bridge of boats. The rapid current is unfavourable to navigation, but from Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d downwards, the river can float boats of 50 tons, and is often descended by rafts on inflated skins.\n\nA marked natural division of the K\u00e1b\u00fal basin occurs near Gandamak, above Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d, where a sudden descent takes effect from a minimum elevation of 5000 feet to one of only 2000. The Emperor B\u00e1bar says of this:\u2014'The moment you descend, you see quite another world. The timber is different; its grains are of another sort; its animals are of a different species; and the manners and customs of its inhabitants are of a different kind.' Burnes, on his first journey, left the wheat harvest in progress at Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d, and found the crop at Gandamak, only 25 miles distant, but 3 inches above ground. Here, in truth, nature has planted one of the gates of India. The valleys of the upper basin, though still in the height of summer affected by a sun of fierce power, recall the climate and products of the finest parts of temperate Europe; the region below is a chain of narrow, low, and hot plains, with climate and vegetation of an Indian character.\n\nThe remainder of the country, regarded by the Afgh\u00e1ns as included\nin Khor\u00e1s\u00e1n, exhibits neither the savage sublimity of the defiles of the K\u00e1b\u00fal region, the alpine forests of its higher ranges, nor its occasional nests of rich vegetation in the valleys, save in the north-east part adjoining Safed Koh, where these characters still adhere, and in some exceptional localities, such as the valley of Her\u00e1t, which is matchless in richness of cultivation. The characteristics of this Khor\u00e1s\u00e1n country are, elevated plateaux of sandy or gravelly surface, broken by ranges of rocky hills, and often expanding into wide spaces of arid waste, which terminate to the south-west in a regular desert of shifting sand. Even in cultivated parts there is a singular absence of trees, and when the crops are not visible, the Khor\u00e1s\u00e1n landscape has an aspect of great desolation and emptiness. Natural wood, however, is found in some parts of West Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n, as in the almost tropical delta of the Helmand, in the Ghor territory, and on the Her\u00e1t river below Her\u00e1t. The trees appear to be for the most part willows, tamarisks, and the like, with little body of foliage.\n\nNext to the K\u00e1b\u00fal river in importance, and probably much exceeding it in volume, as it certainly does in length, is the Helmand (Etymander), the only considerable river in its latitude from the Tigris to the Indus. The Helmand has its highest sources in the Koh-i-B\u00e1ba and Paghm\u00e1n hills, between K\u00e1b\u00fal and B\u00e1mi\u00e1n. Its succeeding course is through the least-known tract of Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n, chiefly occupied by Haz\u00e1ras; indeed, for a length of nearly 300 miles down to Girishk, where the Helmand is crossed by the principal route from Her\u00e1t to Kandah\u00e1r, we know of no published account of the river. The character of the Helmand is said to be that of a mountain river, flowing between scarped rocks, and obstructed by enormous boulders till within 40 miles of Girishk. At that point it enters on a flat country, and, extending over a gravelly bed, begins to be used for purposes of irrigation. Forty-five miles below Girishk, and just below Kala-i-Bist, the Helmand receives its greatest tributary, the Arghand-\u00e1b, flowing west of Kandah\u00e1r from the high Ghilz\u00e1i country. The Helmand here becomes a very considerable river, said to have a width of 300 or 400 yards, and a depth of 9 to 12 feet. But this cannot be the case at all seasons, as fords occur at intervals as far down as P\u00falalik, 100 miles from the mouth. The desert draws near the left bank in its lower course, and throughout its last 150 miles, the moving sands approach to within 1\u00bd miles. The vegetation on the banks is here of a luxuriant, tropical character. The whole of the lower valley seems to have been once the seat of a prosperous population, and there is still a good deal of cultivation for 100 miles below Girishk. Even this, however, has much fallen off, and lower down still more so, owing to disorders and excessive insecurity.\n\nThe course of the Helmand is more or less south-west from its\nsource, till in Seist\u00e1n it approaches meridian $62^\\circ$, when it runs nearly north, and so flows on for 70 or 80 miles, till it falls into the lake of Seist\u00e1n by various mouths. The whole length of the river is about 650 miles. Ferrier considers that it has water enough for navigation at all seasons, from Girishk downwards. At present, boats are rarely seen, and those in use are very clumsy; inflated skin-rafts are employed for crossing.\n\nNext to the Helmand is the Har\u00ed-r\u00fad, rising at an elevation of 9500 or 10,000 feet in lat. $34^\\circ 50'$, long. $66^\\circ 20'$, at a point where the Koh-i-B\u00e1b\u00e1 range branches off into the Koh-Siah and Safed-Koh ranges which form its north and south watersheds. Receiving the waters of several streams, its volume is great at the village of Obeh; here its waters are drawn off by canals for purposes of irrigation. After leaving Her\u00e1t its volume is again increased by other large tributaries; and as it enters Persian territory it divides into two branches, the largest of which flows, without being turned to any account, to within a short distance of Sarrakhs, where it is lost in the steppes. The rise of this river in the spring or season of floods is very considerable; it is then deep and exceedingly difficult to cross. Above Obeh the course is very rapid, and there are several cataracts many feet in height. The whole length of its course may be put down at 500 miles. Minor streams of Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n: The Arghand-\u00e1b, Tarn\u00e1k, Arghest\u00e1n, Dori, Kh\u00e1sh-r\u00fad, Farrah-r\u00fad, Har\u00ed-r\u00fad, K\u00faram, and G\u00famal.\n\nLakes.\u2014As nothing is known of the lake in which the Lor\u00e1 is said to end, and the greater part of the lake or swamp of Seist\u00e1n is excluded from Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n, there remains only the Ab-i-est\u00e1da, on the Ghilz\u00e1i plateau. This is about 65 miles south of Ghazn\u00ed, and stands at a height of about 7000 feet, in a site of most barren and dreary aspect, with no tree or blade of grass, and hardly a habitation in sight. It is about 44 miles in circuit, and very shallow; not more than 12 feet deep in the middle. The chief feeder is the Ghazn\u00ed river. The Afgh\u00e1ns speak of a stream draining the lake; but this report seems ill-founded, although an outflow occurs at intervals from the south end of the lake (as in 1878), and the saltiness and bitterness of the lake argue against it. Fish entering the salt water from the Ghazn\u00ed river, sicken and die.\n\nProvinces and Towns.\u2014The chief political divisions of Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n Proper, in recent times, are stated to be, Kabul, Jalalabad, Ghazni, Kandahar, and Herat, to which are sometimes added the command of the Ghilz\u00e1s and of the Haz\u00e1ras.\n\nAfter the capitals of these divisions, there are but few other places in Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n which can be called towns. The following may be noted here:\n\nIstdl\u00edf is a town in the Koh-i-D\u00e1man, 20 miles N.N.W. of K\u00e1b\u00fal, which was stormed and destroyed, 29th September 1842, by a force\nunder General M'Caskill, to punish the townspeople for the massacre of the garrison at Ch\u00e1rik\u00e1r, and for harbouring the murderers of Burnes. The place is singularly picturesque and beautiful. The rude houses rise terrace over terrace on the mountain-side, forming a pyramid, crowned by a shrine embosomed in a fine clump of planes. The dell below, traversed by a clear, rapid stream, both sides of which are clothed with vineyards and orchards, opens out to the great plain of the D\u00e1man-i-Koh, rich with trees and cultivation, and dotted with turreted castles; beyond these are rocky ridges, and above all the eternal snows of the Hindu Kush. Nearly every householder has his garden with a tower, to which the families repair in the fruit season, closing their houses in the town. The town is estimated, with seven villages depending on it, to contain about 18,000 souls. The inhabitants are T\u00e1jiks, and, contrary to the usual habits of these people, are among the most turbulent class in the country. They have the reputation also of being the best foot-soldiers in Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n, and are a healthy handsome race, fond alike of sport and of war. Coarse cloths, l\u00edng\u00eds and s\u00fasi are manufactured, and a trade in them is maintained with T\u00farkist\u00e1n. There are about 50 families of Sikh shopkeepers. Lat. 34\u00b0 50' N., long. 69\u00b0 7' E.\n\nCh\u00e1rik\u00e1r lies 36 miles north of K\u00e1bul, and about 20 miles north of Ist\u00e1lif, at the north end of Koh-i-D\u00e1man, on the high road to T\u00farkist\u00e1n. Lat. 35\u00b0 3' N.; long. 69\u00b0 10' E. It is watered by a canal, which leaves the Ghorband river at Kalai-Shafi. In 1882, it contained about 3000 houses, and a covered market-place, the traders and shopkeepers being mostly Sikhs, of whom there are about 150 families. Iron ore is brought here in great quantities from the Ghorband mines, and worked up principally for the K\u00e1bul market. There are several mud forts within the town, the largest being the Kala-i-Kazi. In this neighbourhood was the Triodon, or meeting of the three roads from Bactria, spoken of by Strabo and Pliny. Ch\u00e1rik\u00e1r is still the seat of the customs levied on the trade with T\u00farkist\u00e1n. It is also the residence of the governor of the Kohist\u00e1n or hill country of K\u00e1bul, and a place of considerable commerce. During the British occupation, a Political Agent (Major Eldred Pottinger, famous in the defence of Her\u00e1t) was posted here with a G\u00farkha corps under Captain Codrington and Lieutenant Houghton. In the revolt of 1841, after severe fighting, they attempted to make their way to K\u00e1bul, and a great part was cut off. Pottinger, Houghton (with the loss of an arm), and only one sepoy then reached the city, though many were afterwards saved.\n\nKil\u00e1t-i-Ghilz\u00e1i has no town, but is a fortress of some importance on the right bank of the Tarn\u00e1k, on the road between Ghazni and Kandah\u00e1r, 89 miles from the latter, and at a height of 5543 feet. The repulse of the Afgh\u00e1ns in 1842, by a sepoy garrison under Captain\nCraigie, was one of the most brilliant feats of that war. Lat. $32^\\circ 7'$ N.; long. $66^\\circ 55'$ E.\n\nGirishk is also a fort rather than a town, the latter being insignificant. It is important for its position on the high road between Kandah\u00e1r and Her\u00e1t, commanding the ordinary passage and summer ford of the Helmand. It was held by the British from 1839 till August 1842; and for the last nine months of that period amid great difficulties, by a native garrison only, under a gallant Indian soldier, Balwant Singh. Lat. $31^\\circ 45'$ N.; long. $64^\\circ 37'$ E.\n\nFarrah belongs to the Seist\u00e1n basin, and stands on the river that bears its name, and on one of the main routes from Her\u00e1t to Kandah\u00e1r, 164 miles from the former, 236 miles from the latter. The place is enclosed by a huge earthen rampart, crowned with towers, and surrounded by a wide and deep ditch, which can be flooded, and with a covered way. It has the form of a parallelogram, running north and south, and only two gates. As a military position, it is of great importance, but it is excessively unhealthy. Though the place would easily contain 4500 houses, there were but 60 habitable when Ferrier was there in 1845, nor was there much change for the better when Colonel Pelly passed in 1858. Farrah is a place of great antiquity; it would seem to be the Phra of Isidore of Charax (1st century), and possibly also the Prophthasia, though this is perhaps to be sought in the great ruins of Pesh\u00e1war\u00e1n, farther south, near L\u00e1sh. According to Ferrier, who alludes to 'ancient chronicles and traditions,' the city on the present site within the great rampart, was sacked by the armies of Ghinghiz (Chengis Kh\u00e1n), and the survivors transported to another position farther north, where there are now many ruins and bricks of immense size (a yard square), with cuneiform letters, showing that site to be greatly older than the time of Ghinghiz. The population came back to the southern position after the destruction of the medi\u00e6val city by Sh\u00e1h Abbas, and the town prospered again till its bloody siege by N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h. Since then, under constant attacks, it has declined, and in 1837 the remaining population, amounting to 6000, was carried off to Kandah\u00e1r. Such are the vicissitudes of a city on this unhappy frontier. Lat. $32^\\circ 26'$ N.; long. $62^\\circ 8'$ E.\n\nSabzav\u00e1r, the name of which is a corruption of old Persian, Isphiz\u00e1r, 'horse-pastures,' forms another important strategic point, 93 miles from Her\u00e1t, and 71 miles north of Farrah, in similar decay to the latter. The present fort, which in 1845 contained a small b\u00e1z\u00e1r and 100 houses, must once have been the citadel of a large city, now represented by extensive suburbs, partly in ruins. Water is conducted from the Har\u00ed-r\u00fad by numerous canals, which also protect the approaches. Lat. $33^\\circ 17'$ N.; long. $62^\\circ 17'$ E.\n\nZarni is a town in the famous but little explored country of Ghor, to\nthe east of Her\u00e1t, the cradle of a monarchy (the Ghor dynasty) which supplanted the Ghaznevides, and ruled over an extensive dominion, including all Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n, for several generations. Ruins abound; the town itself is small, and enclosed by a wall in decay. It lies in a pleasant valley, through which fine streams wind, said to abound with trout. The hills around are covered with trees, luxuriantly festooned with vines. The population in 1845 was about 1200, among whom Ferrier noticed some Gheber families (remarkable, if correct). The bulk of the people are S\u00faris and Ta\u00edmi\u00fan\u00eds, both apparently very old Persian tribes. The statements in this paragraph rest entirely on Ferrier's authority.\n\nLash is also a fort rather than a town, and is situated 60 miles southwest of Farrah, on the summit of a scarped sugar-loaf eminence, immediately under which flows the Farrah-r\u00fad. Its position with reference to Her\u00e1t, Persia, and Kandah\u00e1r is of very great strategical importance, and for this reason the chief is always possessed of much political influence. There are not more than 70 or 80 houses within its enceinte, but there are always several thousand tents of nomads encamped in its vicinity. Lat. 31\u00b0 43' N.; long. 61\u00b0 35' E.; height 1400 feet.\n\nGhori\u00e1n, situated 35 miles due west of Her\u00e1t, on an extensive and well-cultivated level plain, is a town containing some 500 households, and a fort, built by the Persians in the war with the Afgh\u00e1ns in 1856, on the site of the old citadel, whose battlements are in part still standing without the ditch. On the advance of Persian arms to Her\u00e1t in 1837, this place was given up by treachery, and in 1844 the citadel was demolished by Y\u00e1r Mu\u1e25ammad, to court the favour of the Persian monarch. Lat. 34\u00b0 20' N.; long. 61\u00b0 27' E.\n\nNatural Productions.\u2014Minerals.\u2014Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n is believed to be rich in minerals, but few are wrought. Small quantities of gold are taken from the streams in Laghm\u00e1n and the adjoining districts. Famous silver mines were formerly wrought near the head of the Panjsh\u00edr valley, in the Hindu Kush. Iron of excellent quality is produced in the (independent) territory of Baj\u00e1ur, north-west of Pesh\u00e1war, from magnetic iron sand, and is exported. Iron is also found or reported to exist in the Mahs\u00fad Waz\u00edr\u00ed country. K\u00e1b\u00fal is chiefly supplied from the Perm\u00fal\u00ed (or Farm\u00fal\u00ed) District, between the Upper K\u00faram and G\u00famal, where it is said to be abundant. Iron ore is most plentiful near the passes leading to B\u00e1mi\u00e1n, and in other parts of the Hindu Kush. Copper ore from various parts of Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n has been seen, but it is nowhere worked. Lead is found, e.g., in Upper Bangash (K\u00faram District), and in the Shinw\u00e1ri country (among the branches of the Safed Koh), and in the Kakar country. There are reported to be rich lead mines near Her\u00e1t scarcely worked. Lead, with antimony, is found\nnear the Arghand\u00e1b, 32 miles north-west of Kil\u00e1t-i-Ghilz\u00e1i; in the Wardak hills, 24 miles north of Ghazn\u00ed; in the Ghorband valley, north of K\u00e1bul; and in the Afr\u00edd\u00ed country, near our frontier. Most of the lead used, however, comes from the Haz\u00e1ra country, where the ore is described as being gathered on the surface. An ancient mine of great extent and elaborate character exists at Feringal, in the Ghorband valley. Antimony is obtained in considerable quantities at Sh\u00e1h-Maks\u00fad, about 30 miles north of Kandah\u00e1r. Silicate of zinc in nodular fragments comes from the Zhob District of the Kakar country. It is chiefly used by cutlers for polishing. Sulphur is said to be found at Her\u00e1t, dug from the soil in small fragments, but the chief supply comes from the Haz\u00e1ra country, and from P\u00edrkisri, on the confines of Seist\u00e1n, where there would seem to be a crater or fumarole. Sal-ammoniac is brought from the same place. Gypsum is found in large quantities in the plain of Kandah\u00e1r, being dug out in fragile coralline masses from near the surface. Coal (perhaps lignite) is said to be found in Zurmat (between the Upper K\u00faram and the G\u00famal) and near Ghazn\u00ed. Nitre abounds in the soil over all the south-west of Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n, and often affects the water of the k\u00e1rez or subterranean canals.\n\nClimate.\u2014The climate of a country like Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n is necessarily as diversified as its physical configuration, due almost entirely to difference of elevation rather than of latitude. Taking elevation then as our guide, we find the winter at Ghazn\u00ed, 7280 feet in elevation, most severe, the thermometer sinking to 10\u00b0 and 15\u00b0 Fahr. below zero. Before the 15th December, the passes over the Hindu Kush are closed to all but footmen, and the full force of winter sets in about the middle of January, the thermometer frequently falling 10\u00b0 and 12\u00b0 below zero; and no change occurs before March. In the Haz\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1t also, as well as in K\u00e1bul, the winter is excessively severe. Rigorous as is the winter in the Ghazn\u00ed district, it diminishes in severity as the country falls, and is mildest at Kandah\u00e1r where snow falls only in severe seasons. In Her\u00e1t the winter is tolerably mild, and at Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d it is as mild as in India. As regards the winter season generally in Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n, it may be safely surmised that it is intense above an elevation of 5000 feet; below this elevation it decreases in proportion to the height. The heat of summer is almost everywhere great, except in the very elevated parts of the Hindu Kush and other lofty mountains. In the Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d District the heat during summer is so intense as to produce simooms and destroy animal life. Even at K\u00e1bul, though at an elevation of 5780 feet, the thermometer ranges from 90\u00b0 to 100\u00b0 in summer. At Kandah\u00e1r and Seist\u00e1n it is frequently above 110\u00b0 in the shade, and hot winds blow, accompanied by frequent dust storms. At Her\u00e1t the temperature at this season is generally moderate, and the climate one of the most\nagreeable in Asia. Ferrier says, that for nine months the sun shines with the greatest splendour in Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n, and that the nights are even more beautiful than the days. The monsoon which deluges India has scarcely any effect in this country farther west than the Sulaim\u00e1n range, the rainfall in winter being slight and in summer of rare occurrence. The hot season lasts from June to September; the autumn, winter, and spring months from October to May. In winter, acute pulmonary affections prevail, and from September to November fevers and bowel complaints are very rife.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The great variety of climate and elevation, enriches Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n with the products alike of the temperate and the tropical zones. In most parts of the country there are two harvests, as in India. One of these, called by the Afgh\u00e1ns bah\u00e1rak, or the spring crop, is sown in the end of autumn and reaped in summer. It consists of wheat, barley, and a variety of lentils. The other, called p\u00e1izah or tirm\u00e1i, the autumn crop, is sown in the end of spring and reaped in autumn. It consists of rice, varieties of millet and sorghum, of maize, Phaseolus mungo, tobacco, beet, turnips, etc. The loftier regions have but one harvest. Wheat is the staple food over the greater part of the country. Rice is largely distributed, but is most abundant in Sw\u00e1t (independent), and best in Pesh\u00e1war (British). It is also the chief crop in K\u00faram. In the eastern mountainous country, bajra (Holcus spicatus) is the principal grain. Many English and Indian garden stuffs are cultivated; turnips in some places very largely, as cattle food. Sugar-cane and madder are important products, together with a great variety of melons, grapes, and apples; dried fruits, indeed, form a staple export from Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n to India. Canal irrigation is employed in the K\u00e1b\u00fal valley, while in the western provinces the karez, a peculiar underground aqueduct, is much resorted to.\n\nDomestic Animals.\u2014The camel of Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n is of a more robust and compact breed than the tall beast used in India, and is more carefully tended. The two-humped Bactrian camel is sometimes seen, but is not a native. Horses form a staple export to India. The best of these, however, are brought from Maim\u00e1na, and other places on the Khoras\u00e1n and T\u00farkom\u00e1n frontier. The indigenous horse is the y\u00e1b\u00fa, a stout, heavy-shouldered animal, of about 14 hands high, used chiefly for burden, but also for riding. It gets over incredible distances at an ambling shuffle, but is unfit for fast work, and cannot stand excessive heat. The breed of horses improved rapidly under the late Am\u00edr Dost Muhammad, who took much interest in it. As a rule, colts are sold and worked too young. The cows of Kandah\u00e1r and Seist\u00e1n give very large quantities of milk. They seem to be of the humped variety, but with the hump evanescent. Dairy produce is important in Afgh\u00e1n diet, especially the pressed and dried curd called kr\u00fat (an article and\nname perhaps introduced by the Mongols). There are two varieties of sheep, both having the fat tail. One bears a white fleece, the other a russet or black one. Much of the white wool is exported to Persia, and now largely to Europe and Bombay. Flocks of sheep are the main wealth of the nomad population, and mutton is the chief animal food of the people. In autumn large numbers are slaughtered, their carcases cut up, rubbed with salt, and dried in the sun. The same is done with beef and camel's flesh. The goats, generally black or parti-coloured, seem to be a degenerate variety of the shawl-goat. The climate is found to be favourable to dog-breeding. Pointers are reared in the Kohist\u00e1n of K\u00e1b\u00fal and above Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d\u2014large, heavy, slow-hunting, but fine-nosed and staunch, very like the old double-nosed Spanish pointer. There are greyhounds also, but inferior in speed to second-rate English dogs. The khandi is another sporting dog, most useful, but of complex breed. He is often used for turning up quail and partridge to the hawk.\n\nIndustrial Products.\u2014These are not important. Silk is produced in K\u00e1b\u00fal, Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d, Kandah\u00e1r, and Her\u00e1t, and chiefly consumed in domestic manufactures, though the best qualities are carried to the Punjab and Bombay. Excellent carpets\u2014soft, brilliant, and durable in colour\u2014were made at Her\u00e1t, and usually sold in India as Persian. But the manufacture received a check, and for a time ceased altogether, in 1863. The weavers migrated to Birjand, although a well-known pattern of Persian carpet is still called the Her\u00e1t\u00ed. Excellent felts, and a variety of woven goods, are made from the wool of the sheep, goat, and Bactrian camel. A manufacture, of which there is now a considerable export to the Punjab, for the winter clothing of our irregular troops, besides a large domestic use, is that of the post\u00edn, or sheepskin pelisse. The long wool remains on, and the skin is tanned yellow, with admirable softness and suppleness. Pomegranate rind is a chief material in the preparation. Rosaries are extensively made at Kandah\u00e1r from a soft crystallized silicate of magnesia (chrysolite). The best are of a semi-transparent straw colour, like amber. They are largely exported, especially to Mecca.\n\nTrade.\u2014Practically, there are no navigable rivers in Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n, nor any roads for wheeled carriages. Hence goods are carried on beasts of burden, chiefly camels, along roads which often lie through close and craggy defiles, and narrow stony valleys, among bare mountains, or over waste plains. Though from time immemorial the larger part of the products of India, destined for Western Asia and Europe, has been exported by sea, yet at one time valuable caravans of these products, with the same destination, used to traverse the rugged Afgh\u00e1n roads. The great trade routes are the following:\u2014(1) From Persia by Meshed (Mashad) to Her\u00e1t. (2) From Bokh\u00e1ra, by Maim\u00e1na to Her\u00e1t. (3) From\nthe same quarter, by Karshi, Balkh, and Khulm, to K\u00e1b\u00fal. (4) From the Punjab, by Pesh\u00e1war and the Tat\u00e1ra or Abkh\u00e1na passes to K\u00e1b\u00fal. (5) From the Punjab, by Pesh\u00e1war and Jamr\u00fad, through the Kha\u00edbar pass to K\u00e1b\u00fal. (6) From the Punjab, by the G\u00famal or Ghwal\u00e1ri pass to Ghazn\u00ed. (7) From Sind, by the Bolan pass to Kandah\u00e1r. There is also a route from Eastern T\u00farkist\u00e1n by Chitr\u00e1l or Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d, or to Pesh\u00e1war by D\u00edr; but it is doubtful how far there is any traffic at present.\n\nTowards Sind the chief exports from or through Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n are wool, horses, silk, fruit, madder, and assaf\u0153tida. The staple of local production exported from Kandah\u00e1r is dried fruit. The horse trade in this direction is chiefly carried on by the Sayyids of Pish\u00edn, Kakars, Bakh-tiy\u00e1ris and Bal\u00fachis. The Sayyids also do, or did, dabble largely in slave-dealing. The Haz\u00e1ras furnished the largest part of the victims. Burnes' early anticipation of a large traffic in wool from the regions west of the Indus, has been amply verified, for the trade has for many years been of growing importance; and in 1876-77 the shipment of wool from Sind had reached nearly 20,000,000 lbs. The importation to Sind is chiefly in the hands of Shik\u00e1pur merchants. Indeed, nearly all the trade from southern Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n is managed by Hindus. That between Meshed (Mashad), Her\u00e1t, and Kandah\u00e1r is carried on by Persians, who bring down silk, arms, turquoises, horses, carpets, etc., and take back wool, skins, and woollen fabrics. The chief imports by Pesh\u00e1war into Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n through India, are, cotton, woollen, and silk goods from England; and coarse country cloths, sugar, tea, indigo, Benares brocades, gold thread and lace, scarves, leather groceries, and drugs from India. The exports are raw silk and silk fabrics of Bokh\u00e1ra, gold and silver wire (Russian), horses, almonds, raisins, and fruits generally, furs (including dressed fox-skins and sheep-skins), and bullion.\n\nThe trade with India is thus estimated. I give the latest figures which I have been able to obtain (1884):\n\n| Exports to India | Imports from India | Total |\n|------------------|-------------------|-------|\n| With Sind (1880-81), | \u00a332,732 | \u00a3172,182 | \u00a3204,914 |\n| With Punjab (1880-81), | 324,061 | 986,006 | 1,310,067 |\n| **\u00a3356,793** | **\u00a31,158,188** | **\u00a31,514,981** |\n\nThe Sind figures include part of the trade with Khel\u00e1t, which cannot be separated, but the return omits some passes, and the Bolan exports do not include the large item of wool which enters Sind farther south.\n\nA relic of the old times of Asiatic trade has come down to our day in the habits of the Afgh\u00e1n traders, commonly called Povind\u00e1s, who are at once agriculturists, traders, and warriors, and who spend their lives in carrying on traffic between India, Khoras\u00e1n, and Bokh\u00e1ra, with strings of camels and ponies, banded in large armed caravans, to pro-\ntect themselves, as far as possible, from the ever-recurring exactions on the road. Bullying, fighting, evading, or bribing, they battle their way twice a year between Bokh\u00e1ra and the Indus. Their summer pastures are in the highlands of Ghazn\u00ed and Kil\u00e1t-i-Ghilz\u00e1i. In the autumn they descend the Sulaim\u00e1n passes. At the Indus they have to deposit all weapons with our officers: for, once within the British frontier, they are safe. They leave their families and their camels in the Punjab, and take their goods by rail to Calcutta and the Gangetic cities, or by boat and steamer to Kar\u00e1chi and Bombay. Even in Assam or in distant Rangoon, the Povind\u00e1 is to be seen, pre-eminent by stature and by lofty air, not less than by his rough locks and filthy clothes. In March, they rejoin their families, and move up again to the Ghilz\u00e1i highlands, sending on caravans anew to K\u00e1b\u00fal, Bokh\u00e1ra, Kandah\u00e1r, and Her\u00e1t, the whole returning in time to accompany the tribe down the passes in the autumn. The name Povind\u00e1 is supposed to be derived from the Persian P\u00e1rwinda, a bale of goods, and seems to be indifferently applied to the Loh\u00e1n\u00ed (the most important section), Waz\u00edr\u00eds, Kakars, Ghilz\u00e1s\u00eds, or any other tribe, temporarily or permanently forming part of this singular \u2018trades\u2019 union.\u2019\n\nRaces of Afghanistan. \u2014 These may first be divided into Afgh\u00e1n and non-Afgh\u00e1n, of whom the Afgh\u00e1n people are predominant in numbers, power, and character. A full and very interesting account of them will be found in Dr. Bellew's admirable work. Of the Afgh\u00e1ns proper there are about a dozen great clans, with numerous sub-divisions. Of the great clans the following four are the most important:\n\nThe Dur\u00e1n\u00eds, originally called Abd\u00e1l\u00eds, a name which has been traced to the Ephthalites and Abdela of the Byzantine writers of the 6th century. It was changed to Dur\u00e1n\u00ed from the title of Duri-Dur\u00e1n, \u2018Pearl of the Age,\u2019 assumed by Ahmad Sh\u00e1h of the Saddoz\u00e1i branch of the Popalz\u00e1s\u00eds, when he usurped the supreme power at Kandah\u00e1r on the death of Nadir Sh\u00e1h in 1747, since which time the Dur\u00e1n\u00eds have been the ruling tribe. Their country may be regarded as comprising the whole of the south and south-west of the Afgh\u00e1n plateau, but mainly in the tract between Her\u00e1t and Kandah\u00e1r.\n\nThe Ghilz\u00e1s\u00eds are the strongest of the Afgh\u00e1n clans, and perhaps the bravest. They were supreme in Afghanist\u00e1n in the beginning of the last century, and for a time possessed the throne of Ispah\u00e1n. They occupy the high plateau north of Kandah\u00e1r, and extend, roughly speaking, eastward to the Sulaim\u00e1n mountains, and north to the K\u00e1b\u00fal river (though in places passing these limits), and they extend down the K\u00e1b\u00fal river to Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d. On the British invasion in 1839, the Ghilz\u00e1s\u00eds showed a rooted hostility to the foreigner, and great fidelity to Dost Muhammad, though of a rival clan. It is remarkable that the old Arab geographers of the 10th and 11th centuries place in the Ghilz\u00e1i country\na people called Khilijis, whom they call a tribe of T\u00fcrks, to which belonged a famous family of Delhi kings. The Ghilzais are said to look like T\u00fcrks, whilst the possibility of the identity of the names Khiliji and Ghilz\u00e1i is obvious, and the question touches others regarding the origin of the Afgh\u00e1ns.\n\nThe Yusufz\u00e1s occupy an extensive tract of hills and valleys north of Pesh\u00e1war, including part of the Pesh\u00e1war plain. Except those within the British District of Pesh\u00e1war, they are independent; they are noted, even among Afgh\u00e1ns, for their turbulence.\n\nThe Kakars, still retaining in great measure their independence, occupy a wide extent of elevated country in the south-east of Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n, among the spurs of the Toba and Sulaim\u00e1n mountains, bordering on the Bal\u00fach tribes. But the region is still very imperfectly known.\n\nThe other Afgh\u00e1n clans are the Khuzi\u00e1nis, chiefly in the Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d district; the Mohmandz\u00e1sis, in the hills north-west of Pesh\u00e1war, chief town L\u00e1lpura; the Khataks, chiefly in the districts of Pesh\u00e1war and Koh\u00e1t; the Utm\u00e1n Khel, in the hills north of Pesh\u00e1war; the Bangash, in the Koh\u00e1t, K\u00faram, and M\u00edranz\u00e1i valleys; the Afr\u00edd\u00eds, in the west and south of the Pesh\u00e1war district; the Orakz\u00e1sis, in the T\u00edra highlands, north and west of Koh\u00e1t; and the Shinw\u00e1r\u00eds, in the Khaibar hills and eastern valleys of the Safed-Koh.\n\nOf the non-Afghan population associated with the Afgh\u00e1ns, the T\u00e1jiks come first in importance and numbers. They are intermingled with the Afgh\u00e1ns over the country, though their chief localities are in the west. They are regarded as descendants of the original occupants of that part of the country, of the old Iranian race; they call themselves P\u00e1rsiw\u00e1n and speak a dialect of Persian. They are a fine athletic people, generally fair in complexion, and resemble the Afgh\u00e1ns in aspect, in dress, and much in manners. But they are never nomadic. They are chiefly agriculturists, while those in towns follow mechanical trades and the like, which the Afgh\u00e1n seldom does. They are generally devoid of the turbulence of the Afgh\u00e1ns, whom they are content to regard as masters and superiors, and lead a frugal, industrious life, without aspiring to a share in the government of the country. Many, however, become soldiers in the Amir's army, and many enlist in our local Punjab regiments. They are zealous Sunnis. The T\u00e1jiks of the D\u00e1man-i-Koh of K\u00e1bul are said to be of an exceptionally turbulent and vindictive character.\n\nThe Kizilb\u00e1shis or 'Red Heads' may be regarded as modern Persians, but more strictly they are Persianized T\u00fcrks, like the present royal race and predominant class in Persia. Their immigration dates only from the last century, in the time of N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h (1737). They are chiefly to be found in K\u00e1bul as merchants, physicians, scribes, petty traders, etc., and are justly looked on as the more educated\nand superior class of the population. They are a fine race, and very fair in complexion, and fill important posts in the civil administration of the country. Many serve in our Indian regiments of irregular cavalry, and bear a character for smartness and intelligence, as well as for good riding. They are Shi\u00e1s, and heretics in Afgh\u00e1n eyes. It is to the industry of the P\u00e1rsiw\u00e1ns and Kizilb\u00e1shis that the country is indebted for whatever wealth it possesses, but few of them ever attain a position which is not in some degree subservient to the Afgh\u00e1n.\n\nThe Haz\u00e1ras have their stronghold and proper home in the wild mountainous country on the north-west of Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n Proper, including those western extensions of the Hindu Kush, to which modern geographers have often applied the ancient name of Paropamisus. In these, their habitations range generally from a height of 5000 feet to 10,000 feet above the sea. This portion, known as the Haz\u00e1raj\u00e1t, has always been almost entirely independent of the ruler of K\u00e1b\u00fal, and it is said no Afgh\u00e1n can pass through it.\n\nThe Haz\u00e1ras generally have features of a Mongol type, often to a degree that might be called exaggerated, and there can be little doubt that they are mainly descended from fragments of Mongol tribes, who came from the east with the armies of Ghinghiz Kh\u00e1n and his family, though other races may be represented among the tribes called Haz\u00e1ras. The Haz\u00e1ras generally are said by Major Leech to be called Mughals by the Ghilz\u00e1\u00eds; and one tribe, still bearing the specific name of Mongol, and speaking a Mongol dialect, is found near the head waters of the Murgh-\u00e1b, and also farther south on the skirts of the Ghor mountains. But it is remarkable that the Haz\u00e1ras generally speak a purely Persian dialect. The Mongols of the host of Ghinghiz were divided into tum\u00e1ns (ten thousands) and haz\u00e1ras (thousands), and it is probably in this use of the word that the origin of its present application is to be sought. The oldest occurrence of this application that M. de Khanikoff has met with, is in a rescript of Ghazan Kh\u00e1n of Persia, regarding the security of roads in Khoras\u00e1n, dated A.H. 694 (A.D. 1294\u201395).\n\nThough the Haz\u00e1ras, in the more accessible of their districts, pay tribute to the Afgh\u00e1n chiefs, they never do so unless payment is enforced by arms. The country which they occupy is very extensive, embracing the upper valleys of the Arghand-\u00e1b and the Helmand, both sides of the main range of the Hindu Kush, nearly as far east as the longitude of the Andar-\u00e1b, the hill country of B\u00e1mi\u00e1n, and that at the head waters of the Balkh river, the Murgh-\u00e1b, and the Har\u00ed-r\u00fad, altogether an area of something like 30,000 square miles. The Haz\u00e1ras are popularly accused of loose domestic morals, like the ancient Massagete. They manufacture gunpowder, are excellent shots, and, in spite of the nature of their country, are good horsemen, riding at speed down very steep declivities. They are said to have a j\u00f6del like the\nSwiss. They are often sold as slaves, and as such are prized. During the winter many spread over Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n, and even into the Punjab, in search of work. Excepting near Ghazn\u00ed, where they hold some lands and villages, the position of the Haz\u00e1ras found in the proper Afgh\u00e1n country, is a menial one. They are Shi\u00e1s in religion. The majority speak Persian.\n\nAim\u00e1k is a term for a sept or section of a tribe. It has come to be applied, like the haz\u00e1ra, to certain nomadic or semi-nomadic tribes west of the Haz\u00e1ras, of whom we have been speaking, and immediately north and east of Her\u00e1t. These tribes are known as \u2018the four Aim\u00e1ks.\u2019 It is difficult in the present state of information regarding them, sometimes contradictory, to discern what is the broad distinction between the Aim\u00e1ks and the Haz\u00e1ras, unless it be that the Aim\u00e1ks are principally of Ir\u00e1nian or quasi-Ir\u00e1nian blood, the Haz\u00e1ras of Turanian. The Aim\u00e1ks are also Sunnis. Part of them are subject to Persia.\n\nHindk\u00eds.\u2014This name is sometimes given to people of Hindu descent scattered over Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n. They are said to be of the Kshattriya or military caste. Occupied in commerce, they are found in most of the large villages, and in the towns form an important part of the population, doing all the banking business of the country, and holding its chief trade in their hands. They pay a high poll-tax, and are denied many privileges, but thrive notwithstanding. The J\u00e1ts of Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n doubtless belong to the same vast race as the Jats and J\u00e1ts, who form so large a part of the population of the territories now governed from Lahore and Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee), and whose origin is so obscure. They are a fine, athletic, dark, handsome race, considerable in numbers, but poor, and usually gaining a livelihood as farm-servants, barbers, sweepers, musicians, etc.\n\nBal\u00fachis.\u2014Of Iranian stock, are represented in Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n by a number of hill tribes in the south-east corner. Some also squat among the abandoned tracts on the lower Helmand; the more important are known as Kasr\u00e1n\u00eds, Hozd\u00e1rs, Khos\u00e1bs, Lagh\u00e1r\u00eds, Gurch\u00e1n\u00ed, Marris, and Bugt\u00eds; they are a fierce and savage people, professing Isl\u00e1m, but not observing its precepts, and holding the grossest superstitions; vendetta is their most stringent law; they are insensible to privation, and singularly tolerant of heat; camel-like in capacity to do without drink; and superior to the Afgh\u00e1ns in daring and address.\n\nThere remain a variety of tribes in the hill country north of the K\u00e1b\u00fal river, speaking various languages, seemingly of Pr\u00e1kritic character, and known as Koh\u00edst\u00e1n\u00eds, Laghm\u00e1n\u00ed, Saf\u00eds, etc.; apparently converted remnants of the aboriginal tribes of the K\u00e1b\u00fal basin, and more or less kindred to the still unconverted tribes of K\u00e1f\u00edrist\u00e1n, to the Chitr\u00e1l people, and perhaps to the Dard tribes, who lie to the north of the Afgh\u00e1n country on the Indus.\nThe tract called K\u00e1frist\u00e1n, due north of the Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d district, and extending to the snows of the Hindu Kush, is supposed to be inhabited by a fair, interesting, and somewhat mysterious people, who are called Siah Posh K\u00e1firs (black-clothed unbelievers), who may be one of the earliest offshoots of the Aryan race, or perhaps part of the original stock itself, and who are said to have remained for ages in or near their original home. Few Europeans have seen any of this curious race, and even the Muhammadans bordering on their frontiers are unable to give any information respecting them. It is reported that they have some distinctly European customs, as sitting on chairs and using tables, and are affirmed to build their houses of wood, of several stories in height, and that they are much embellished with carving. Major Tanner states that the carving of the houses in Aret, the nearest village to K\u00e1frist\u00e1n reached by him in his attempt to explore this country, was most remarkable. It is possible that some of the Greco-Bactrians, when driven from the cities in the valley of the K\u00e1b\u00fal river, may have sought refuge in this almost inaccessible region, and have been absorbed by the old population. Up to the present time they have resisted all the attempts of the Afgh\u00e1ns to subdue and convert them to Muhammadanism, though those who live on the borders have had to submit, and are called Nimchas. See article KAFIRISTAN.\n\nAn able officer of the staff in India (General Sir Charles Macgregor) has lately made a careful attempt to estimate the population of Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n, which he sets down at 4,901,000 souls, of whom about 2\u00bd millions are supposed to be Afgh\u00e1ns. This includes the estimated population of Afgh\u00e1n T\u00fark\u00edst\u00e1n (about 642,000), the people of Chitr\u00e1l, the K\u00e1firs, and the independent Yusufz\u00e1\u00eds.\n\nThe pastoral and agricultural stages of human development may still be seen side by side in Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n. The nomad tribes roam through the wide plains of Khor\u00e1s\u00e1n; the agricultural sections are settled in village communities. As a race, the Afgh\u00e1ns are very handsome and athletic, often with fair complexion, a flowing beard, generally black or brown, though sometimes red; the features highly aquiline. The hair is shaved off from the forehead to the top of the head, the remainder at the sides being allowed to fall in large curls over the shoulders. Their step is full of resolution, their bearing proud, and apt to be rough. They are passionately fond of hawking and hunting. The women have handsome features of Jewish cast (the last trait often true also of the men); fair complexions, sometimes rosy, though usually a pale sallow; hair braided and plaited behind in two long tresses, terminating in silken tassels. They are rigidly secluded, but intrigue is frequent. In some parts of the country the engaged lover is admitted to visits of courtship analogous to old Welsh customs.\nThe Afgh\u00e1ns, inured to bloodshed from childhood, are familiar with death, audacious in attack, but easily discouraged by failure; excessively turbulent and unsubmitive to law or discipline; apparently frank and affable in manner, especially when they hope to gain some object, but capable of the grossest brutality when that hope ceases. They are unscrupulous in perjury, treacherous, vain, and insatiable; passionate in revenge, which they will satisfy in the most cruel manner even at the cost of their own lives. Nowhere is crime committed on such trifling grounds, or with such general impunity, though when it is punished, the punishment is atrocious. 'Nothing,' says Sir Herbert Edwardes, 'is finer than their physique, or worse than their morale.' Elphinstone has touched his sketch with a more friendly hand.\n\nPolitical Institutions.\u2014The men of the section (kandi) of a village, having come to a decision, send their representative to a council of the whole village, and these again to that of the sept (khel), and the appointed chiefs of the septs finally assemble as the council (jirgah) of the ill\u00fa or tribe. These meetings, in all their stages, are apt to be stormy. But when once a council has decided, implicit compliance is incumbent on the tribe, under heavy penalties, which the maliks, or chiefs of tribes, have the power of enforcing. Justice is administered in the towns, more or less effectively, according to Muhammadan law, by a k\u00e1zi and muft\u00eds. But the unwritten code by which Afgh\u00e1n communities in their typical state are guided, and the maxims of which penetrate the whole nation, is the Pukht\u00ednw\u00e1li, or usage of the Path\u00e1ns, a rude system of customary law, founded on principles such as one might suppose to have prevailed before the institution of civil government. A prominent law in this code is that called Nanawati, or 'entering in.' By this law, the Path\u00e1n is bound to grant any boon claimed by the person who passes his threshold and invokes its sanctions, even at the sacrifice of his own life and property. So also, the Path\u00e1n is bound to feed and shelter any traveller claiming hospitality. Retaliation must be exacted by the Path\u00e1n for every injury or insult, and for the life of a kinsman. If immediate opportunity fail, a man will watch his foe for years, with the cruel purpose ever uppermost, using every treacherous artifice to entrap him. To omit such obligations, above all the vendetta, exposes the Path\u00e1n to scorn. The injuries of one generation may be avenged in the next, or even by remoter posterity. The relatives of a murdered man may, however, before the tribunal council, accept a blood-price. The crimes punished by the Path\u00e1n code, are such as murder without cause, refusal to go to battle, contravention of the decision of a tribal council, adultery.\n\nThe Afgh\u00e1ns are Muhammadans of the Sunn\u00ed or orthodox body, with the exception of a few tribes, perhaps not truly Path\u00e1n, who are Shi\u00e1s.\nThey are much under the influence of their *mull\u00e1s*, especially for evil, and have a stronger feeling against the Shi\u00e1 heretic, than against the unbeliever, their aversion to the Persians being aggravated thereby. But to those of another faith they are more tolerant than most Muhammadans, unless when creed becomes a war-cry.\n\n**Government.**\u2014Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n has from time to time been, and is now, under one prince, but it is hardly a monarchy as we are wont to understand the term. It is rather the government of a dictator for life over a military aristocracy, and within this, a congeries of small democracies. The *sard\u00e1rs* govern in their respective districts, each after his own fashion; jealous, ambitious, turbulent, the sovereign can restrain them only by their divisions. There is no unity nor permanence. In war, as in peace, chiefs and soldiers are ready to pass from one service to another without scruple. The spirit of Afgh\u00e1n character and institutions was tersely expressed by an old man to Elphinstone, who had urged the advantages of quiet and security under a strong king: \u2018We are content with discord, we are content with alarms, we are content with blood, but we will never be content with a master.\u2019\n\n**Revenues.**\u2014The revenues of Dost Mu\u1e25ammad Kh\u00e1n were estimated in 1857 at 4,000,000 rupees, or about \u00a3400,000. This included Afgh\u00e1n T\u00farkist\u00e1n, but not Her\u00e1t, which he did not then hold. The Her\u00e1t revenue was estimated some years before (probably too low) at \u00a380,000. In the latter years of Dost Mu\u1e25ammad (1863), the revenue is stated to have amounted to \u00a3710,000, of which the army cost \u00a3430,000. In 1879 the revenue of Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n, including Afgh\u00e1n T\u00farkist\u00e1n, was estimated at \u00a3733,000. Information on this subject is very imperfect, and not always consistent. Yak\u00fab Kh\u00e1n told a British officer (Major Biddulph) in 1880 that the whole revenue of Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n, including Maim\u00e1na and Badakhsh\u00e1n, amounts to about \u00a31,500,000, of which a large portion is paid in kind. The chief sources of revenue are said to be, land, town duties, customs, the produce of the royal demesne, fines, forfeiture, mint, etc. There seems to be a tax on the produce of the soil, both in kind and in money, and a special tax on garden ground. A house tax of about 5 rupees is paid by all who are not Path\u00e1ns. The latter pay a much lighter tax under another name, and the Hindus pay the separate poll-tax (*jaziya*). Taxes are paid on horses, etc., kept, and on the sale of animals in the public market. In many parts of the country, collections are only made spasmodically by military force. The people are let alone for years, till need and opportunity arise, when an army is marched in and arrears extorted. Customs dues at K\u00e1b\u00fal and Kandah\u00e1r, are only $2\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent. nominally, but this is increased a good deal by exactions. There is a considerable tax on horses exported for sale, and a toll on beasts of burden exporting merchandise, from 6 rupees on a loaded camel, to 1 rupee on a donkey.\nMilitary Force.\u2014According to the old system, the Afgh\u00e1n forces were entirely composed of the \u00fal\u00eds, or tribesmen of the chiefs, who were supposed to hold their lands on a condition of service, but who, as frequently as not, went over to the enemy in the day of need. As a counterpoise, the late Amir Dost Muhammad began to form a regular army. In 1858, this force contained 16 infantry regiments of (nominally) 800 men, 3 of cavalry of 300 men, and about 80 field-pieces, besides a few heavy guns, largely increased of late years. There were also Jezailch\u00ed (riflemen) irregulars\u2014some in the Am\u00edr\u2019s pay, others levies of the local chiefs; and a considerable number of irregular cavalry. The pay is bad and extremely irregular, and punishments are severe.\n\nLanguage and Literature.\u2014Persian is the vernacular of a large part of the non-Afgh\u00e1n population, and is familiar to all educated Afgh\u00e1ns. But the proper language of the Afgh\u00e1ns is Pusht\u00fa, or Pukht\u00fa, classed by the most competent as Aryan or Indo-Persian dialects. The oldest work in Pusht\u00fa, is a history of the conquest of Sw\u00e1t by Shaikh M\u00e1li, a chief of the Yusufz\u00e1\u00eds, and leader in the conquest (A.D. 1413\u201324). The literature is rich in poetry; Abdur Rahm\u00e1n (17th century) being the best known poet. Pusht\u00fa seems to be but little spoken west of the Helmand.\n\nHistory.\u2014The Afgh\u00e1n chroniclers call their people Beni-Isr\u00e1il (Arabic for children of Israel), and claim descent from King Saul (whom they call by the Muhammadan corruption T\u00edl\u00ed\u00fa), through a son whom they ascribe to him, called Jeremiah, who again had a son called Afgh\u00e1na. This story is repeated with great variety of detail in the Afgh\u00e1n poems and chronicles. But the oldest of these appears to be of the 16th century; nor do we know that any trace of the legend is found of a previous date.\n\nIn the time of Darius Hystaspes (B.C. 500), we find Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n embraced under various names, in the Ach\u00e6menian satrapies. Alexander\u2019s march led him to Artacoana (Kain), a city of Aria, and thence to the country of the Zarang\u00e6 (Seist\u00e1n), to that of the Euerget\u00e6, upon the Etymander (Helmand river), to Arachosia, thence to the Indians dwelling among snows in a barren country, probably the highlands between Ghazn\u00ed and K\u00e1b\u00fal. Thence he marched to the foot of the Caucasus, and spent the winter among the Paropamisadae, founding a city, Alexandria, supposed to be Hupi\u00e1n, near Ch\u00e1r\u00edk\u00e1r. On his return from Bactria, he prosecuted his march to India by the north side of the K\u00e1b\u00fal river. The Ariana of Strabo corresponds generally with the existing dominions of K\u00e1b\u00fal, but overpasses their limits on the west and south.\n\nAbout 310 B.C., Seleukos is said by Strabo to have given to the Indian Sandrokottos (Chandragupta), in consequence of a marriage contract, some part of the country west of the Indus, occupied by an Indian\npopulation, and no doubt embracing a part of the K\u00e1b\u00fal basin. Some sixty years later, occurred the establishment of an independent Greek kingdom in Bactria, which eventually extended into Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n. The K\u00e1b\u00fal basin formed the starting-point of Gr\u00e6co-Bactrian expeditions into India, and is rich in coins of that dynasty. In the 7th century, Hwen Thsang, the Chinese pilgrim, 630\u201345 A.D., found both T\u00fark\u00ed and Indian princes reigning in the K\u00e1b\u00fal valley. The last Hindu prince of K\u00e1b\u00fal succumbed to the Muhamm\u00e1dans in the 10th century. The great dynasty of Mahm\u00fad of Ghazn\u00ed had its seat in Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n, as had also the later one of Ghor, both of which conquered India. More or less connected with Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n were the so-called Path\u00e1n dynasties that reigned at Delhi from the 12th to the 16th century.\n\nThe whole of Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n was conquered by Tim\u00far, and K\u00e1b\u00fal remained in the hands of a descendant till 1501; soon after which, another more illustrious descendant, Sult\u00e1n B\u00e1bar, captured it, adding Kandah\u00e1r in 1522. For the next two centuries, K\u00e1b\u00fal was held by the Mughal Emperors of Delhi, Her\u00e1t by Persia, while Kandah\u00e1r repeatedly changed hands between the two. In 1708, Kandah\u00e1r expelled the Persians, and set up a chief of the Ghilz\u00e1i tribe; in 1715, Her\u00e1t also became an independent Afgh\u00e1n State. In 1720\u201322, the Ghilz\u00e1\u00eds took Ispah\u00e1n, and held the throne of Persia for a short space. N\u00e1d\u00edr Sh\u00e1h of Persia reoccupied the Afgh\u00e1n Provinces (1737\u201338), and held them till his assassination in 1747. During the anarchy which followed his death, the different provinces of Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n were gradually formed into a single empire under Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1ni, and the Persians were again expelled. On Ahmad Sh\u00e1h\u2019s death in 1773, the Afgh\u00e1n sovereignty included the Punjab and Kashmir on the south-east, and extended to T\u00fark\u00edst\u00e1n and the Oxus on the north.\n\nIn 1809, in consequence of the intrigues of Napoleon in Persia, the Hon. Mountstuart Elphinstone had been sent as envoy to Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1, then in power, and had been well received by him at Pesh\u00e1war. This was the first time the Afgh\u00e1ns made any acquaintance with Englishmen. Lieutenant Alexander Burnes visited K\u00e1b\u00fal (then ruled by Am\u00edr Dost Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, of the Barakz\u00e1\u00ed family) on his way to Bokh\u00e1ra in 1832. In 1837, the Persian siege of Her\u00e1t, and the proceedings of Russia, created uneasiness, and Burnes was sent by the Governor-General as Resident to the Am\u00edr\u2019s court at K\u00e1b\u00fal. But the terms which the Am\u00edr sought, were not conceded by the Government, and the rash resolution was taken, of re-establishing Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1, long a refugee in British territory. Ranj\u00edt Singh, M\u00e1h\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of the Punjab, bound himself to co-operate, but eventually declined to let our expedition cross his territories, though a Sikh force, with Sir Claud Wade and a small British detachment, advanced through the Khaibar. The \u2018Army of the Indus,\u2019 amounting to 21,000 men, therefore assembled in\nUpper Sind (March 1838), and advanced through the Bolan Pass, under the command of Sir John Keane. Kohandil Kh\u00e1n of Kandah\u00e1r fled to Persia. That city was occupied in April 1839, and Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1 was crowned in his grandfather's mosque. Ghazn\u00ed was reached on the 21st July; a gate of the city was blown open by the engineers (the match was fired by Lieut. afterwards Major-General Sir Henry Durand), and the place was taken by storm. Dost Muhammad, finding his troops deserting, passed the Hindu Kush, and Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1 entered the capital (7th August). The war was thought at an end, and Sir John Keane (made a peer) returned to India, leaving behind 8000 men, besides the Sh\u00e1h's force, with Sir William Macnaghten as Envoy, and Sir Alexander Burnes as Resident.\n\nDuring the two following years, Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1 and his allies remained in possession of K\u00e1b\u00fal and Kandah\u00e1r. The British outposts extended to Saigh\u00e1n, in the Oxus basin, and to Mull\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n, on the lower Helmand. Dost Muhammad surrendered (Nov. 3, 1840), and was sent to India, where he was honourably treated. From the beginning, insurrection against the new government had been rife. The political authorities were over confident, and neglected warnings. On the 2nd November 1841, revolt broke out violently at K\u00e1b\u00fal, with the massacre of Burnes and other officers. The position of the British camp, its communications with the citadel, and the location of the stores were the worst possible; and the general (Elphinstone) was shattered in constitution. Disaster after disaster occurred, not without misconduct. At a conference (23rd December) with the Am\u00edr Dost Muhammad's son, Akbar Kh\u00e1n, who had taken the lead of the Afgh\u00e1ns, Sir William Macnaghten was murdered by that chief's own hand. On the 6th January 1842, after a convention to evacuate the country had been signed, the British garrison, still numbering 4500 soldiers (of whom 690 were Europeans), with some 12,000 followers, marched out of the camp. The winter was severe, the troops demoralized, the march a mass of confusion and massacre; for there was hardly a pretence of keeping the terms. On the 13th, the last survivors mustered at Gandamak only twenty muskets. Of those who left K\u00e1b\u00fal, Dr. Brydon only reached Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d, wounded and half dead. Ninety-five prisoners were afterwards recovered. The garrison of Ghazn\u00ed had already been forced to surrender (10th December). But General Nott held Kandah\u00e1r with a stern hand, and General Sale, who had reached Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d from K\u00e1b\u00fal at the beginning of the outbreak, maintained that important point gallantly.\n\nTo avenge these disasters and recover the prisoners, preparations were made in India on a fitting scale; but it was the 16th April 1842 before General Pollock could relieve Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d, after forcing the Khaibar Pass. After a long halt there, he advanced (20th August), and gaining rapid successes, occupied K\u00e1b\u00fal (15th September), where Nott,\nafter retaking and dismantling Ghazn\u00ed, joined him two days later. The prisoners were recovered from B\u00e1mi\u00e1n. The citadel and central b\u00e1z\u00e1r of K\u00e1b\u00fal were destroyed, and the army finally evacuated Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n in December 1842.\n\nSh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1 had been assassinated soon after the departure of the ill-fated garrison. Dost Muhammad, released, was able to resume his position at K\u00e1b\u00fal, which he retained till his death in 1863. Akbar Kh\u00e1n was made Waz\u00edr, but died in 1848.\n\nThe most notable facts in later history must be briefly stated. In 1848, during the second Sikh war, Dost Muhammad, stimulated by popular outcry, and by the Sikh offer to restore Pesh\u00e1war, crossed the frontier and took Attock. A cavalry force of Afgh\u00e1ns was sent to join Sher Singh against the British, and was present at the battle of Gujr\u00e1t (21st Feb. 1849). The Afgh\u00e1ns were hotly pursued to the passes.\n\nIn 1850, the Afgh\u00e1ns re-conquered Balkh, and in January 1855, friendly intercourse, which had been renewed between the Am\u00edr and the British Government, led to the conclusion of a treaty at Pesh\u00e1war. In November 1855, the Am\u00edr made himself master of Kandah\u00e1r. In 1856 came the new Persian advance to Her\u00e1t, ending in its capture, and the English expedition to the Persian Gulf. In January 1857, the Am\u00edr had an interview at Pesh\u00e1war with Sir John Lawrence, at which the former was promised arms and a subsidy for protection against Persia. In consequence of this treaty, a British mission under Major Lumsden proceeded to Kandah\u00e1r. The Indian Mutiny followed, and the Afgh\u00e1n excitement strongly tried the Am\u00edr\u2019s fidelity, but he maintained it. Lumsden\u2019s party held their ground, and returned in May 1858.\n\nIn 1863, Dost Muhammad, after a ten months\u2019 siege, captured Her\u00e1t; but he died there thirteen days later (9th June), and was succeeded by his son Sher Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n. The latter passed through many vicissitudes, in rivalry with his brothers and nephews, and at one time (1867) his fortunes were so low that he held only Balkh and Her\u00e1t. By the autumn of 1868, however, he was again established on the throne of K\u00e1b\u00fal, and his competitors were beaten and dispersed. In April 1869, Sher Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n was splendidly received at Amb\u00e1la (Umballa) by the Earl of Mayo, who had shortly before succeeded Sir John Lawrence as Viceroy. Friendly relations were confirmed, and the Am\u00edr received the balance of a donation of \u00a3120,000 which had been partly paid by Sir John Lawrence. A present of artillery and arms was also made to him, followed by occasional aid.\n\nIn the early part of 1873, a correspondence which had gone on between the Governments of Russia and England resulted in a declaration by the former that Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n was beyond the field of Russian influence; while the Oxus, from its source in Lake Sir-i-K\u00fal to the\nwestern limit of Balkh, was recognised as the frontier of Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n. The principal events between 1873 and 1878 were the Am\u00edr\u2019s efforts in 1873 to secure a British guarantee for his sovereignty and family succession; Lord Lytton\u2019s endeavours in 1876, to obtain the Am\u00edr\u2019s consent to the establishment of British Agencies in Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n; and the Pesh\u00e1war Conference, with a similar view, in 1877, which was brought to an end by the death of the Am\u00edr\u2019s envoy.\n\nIn July 1878, a Russian mission, under General Stolietoff, was received with honour at K\u00e1b\u00fal; while the Am\u00edr Sher Al\u00ed shortly afterwards refused permission for a British mission, under Sir Neville Chamberlain, to cross his frontier. After some remonstrance and warning, an ultimatum was despatched, and, no reply being received up to the last date allowed, the Am\u00edr\u2019s attitude was accepted as one of hostility to the British Government. On the 21st November, an invasion of Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n was decided upon, and within a few days the British forces were in full occupation of the Khaibar Pass and the K\u00faram Valley, after inflicting severe defeats on the Afgh\u00e1n troops. The Am\u00edr fled from K\u00e1b\u00fal on the 13th December, accompanied by the members of the Russian mission, and, on the 21st February 1879, died, a fugitive, at Mazar-i-Shariff, in Afgh\u00e1n T\u00farkist\u00e1n. His second son, Y\u00e1k\u00fab Kh\u00e1n, who had been kept a close prisoner by his father at K\u00e1b\u00fal, but was released before the Am\u00edr\u2019s flight, was recognised by the people as Am\u00edr. In May 1879, Y\u00e1k\u00fab adjusted all differences by voluntarily coming into the British camp at Gandamak, and signing the treaty which bears the name of that place. Its chief features were the rectification of the frontier in the sense proposed by the British, the acceptance of a British Resident at K\u00e1b\u00fal, and the complete subordination of the foreign relations of Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n to British influences. Under that treaty, Major Sir Louis Cavagnari was appointed to this post, and was welcomed to the city with great apparent cordiality by the Am\u00edr Y\u00e1k\u00fab Kh\u00e1n. Owing, however, to intrigues, which will probably never be unravelled, the fanatical party was allowed to gain head. On 3rd September 1879, the Residency was attacked by a rabble of townspeople and troops, and the British Resident and his escort were murdered, after a valiant defence. In October 1879, an avenging force marched under General (now Sir Frederick) Roberts up the K\u00faram, and occupied K\u00e1b\u00fal. The B\u00e1la Hiss\u00e1r, including the fort and palace, was partially destroyed. The Am\u00edr, Y\u00e1k\u00fab Kh\u00e1n, whose complicity was suspected, abdicated, and was removed to India; and the guilty city remained under British occupation for a year. A new Am\u00edr, Abdur Rahm\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, was recognised on the 22nd July 1880; and the punitive purposes of the expedition having been accomplished, the British troops were withdrawn from K\u00e1b\u00fal in August 1880.\n\nAntiquities.\u2014The basin of the K\u00e1b\u00fal river abounds in remains\nof the period when Buddhism flourished, beginning with the Inscribed Rock of Shahb\u00e1zgarhi, or Kapur-di-giri, in the Pesh\u00e1war plain, which bears one of the replicas of the famous edicts of As\u00f3ka (not later than B.C. 250). In the Koh-i-D\u00e1man, north of K\u00e1b\u00fal, are the sites of several ancient cities, the greatest of which, called Baghr\u00e1m, has furnished coins in scores of thousands, and has been supposed to represent Alexander's Nicaea. Nearer K\u00e1b\u00fal, and especially on the hills some miles south of the city, are numerous topes. In the valley of Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d are many remains of the same character. In the neighbourhood of Pesh\u00e1war are numerous ancient cities and walled villages, in many cases presenting ruins of much interest, besides the remains of topes, monasteries, cave temples, etc.; and frequently sculptures have been found on those sites, exhibiting evident traces of the influence of Greek art. The Mah\u00e1ban mountain, near the Indus, which has been plausibly identified with the Aornos of the Greeks, and the hills more immediately compassing the Pesh\u00e1war valley, abound in the ruins of ancient fortresses. At Talash, on the Panjkor\u00e1 river, are ruins of massive fortifications; and in Sw\u00e1t, there are said to be remains of several ancient cities.\n\nIn the valley of the Tarn\u00e1k are the ruins of a great city (Ul\u00e1n Rob\u00e1t), supposed to be the ancient Arachosia. Near Girishk, also, on the Helmand, are extensive mounds and other traces of buildings; and the remains of several great cities exist in the plain of Seist\u00e1n, as at Pulki, Pesh\u00e1war\u00e1n, and L\u00e1sh, relics of ancient Drangiana, not yet sufficiently examined. An ancient stone vessel, preserved at a village near Kandah\u00e1r, is almost certainly the same that was treasured at Pesh\u00e1war in the 5th century as the begging-pot of Sakya-Muni. Of the city of Ghazn\u00ed, the vast capital of Mahm\u00fad and his race, no substantial relics survive, except the tomb of Mahm\u00fad and two remarkable brick minarets. To the vast and fruitful harvest of coins which has been gathered in Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n and the adjoining regions only a passing allusion can here be made.\n\nAfgh\u00e1n-T\u00farkist\u00e1n is a convenient name applied of late years to those provinces in the basin of the Oxus which are subject to the Am\u00edr of K\u00e1b\u00fal. Badakhsh\u00e1n and its dependencies, now understood to be tributary to the Am\u00edr, are sometimes comprised under the name, but will not be so included here. The whole of the Afgh\u00e1n dominions consist of Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n as above described, Afgh\u00e1n-T\u00farkist\u00e1n, and Badakhsh\u00e1n with its dependencies. This article is abridged from the same published source as the preceding one.\n\nThe territories here included are, beginning from the east, the kh\u00e1n\u00e1ts or principalities of Kund\u00faz, Khulm or T\u00e1shkurghan, Balkh with Akcha; and the western kh\u00e1n\u00e1ts of Sir-i-p\u00fal, Shibarkh\u00e1n, Andkh\u00f3i, and Maim\u00e1na, sometimes classed together as the Ch\u00e1r Wil\u00e1yat, or\n'Four Domains;' and besides these, such part of the Haz\u00e1ra tribes as lie north of the Hindu Kush and its prolongation, defined in the article Afghanistan. The tract thus described includes the southern half of the Oxus basin, from the frontier of Badakhsh\u00e1n on the east, to the upper Murgh-\u00e1b river on the west. The Oxus itself forms the northern boundary, from the confluence of the Kokch\u00e1, or river of Badakhsh\u00e1n, in $69\\frac{1}{2}\u00b0$ E. long., to Khoj\u00e1 S\u00e1leh ferry, in $65\u00b030\u2032$ E. long. nearly. Here the boundary quits the river and skirts the Turkom\u00e1n desert to the point where the Murgh-\u00e1b issues upon it in about lat. $36\u00b040\u2032$ N. Along the whole southern boundary there is a tract of lofty mountain country. Thus, in the east, south of Kund\u00faz, we have the Hindu Kush rising far into the region of perpetual snow, with passes ranging from $12,000$ to $13,000$ feet and upwards. South of Khulm and Balkh is the prolongation of the Hindu Kush, called Koh-i-B\u00e1ba, in which the elevation of the cols or passes seems to be nearly as high, though the general height of the crest is lower. The mountains then fork in three branches westward,\u2014viz. Koh-i-Si\u00e1h, 'The Black Mountain,' to the south of the Har\u00ed-r\u00fad or Her\u00e1t river; Koh-i-Safed, 'The White Mountain,' between the headwaters of the Har\u00ed-r\u00fad and the Murgh-\u00e1b; and a third ridge north of the latter river, called the Tirband-i-T\u00farkist\u00e1n Mountains. The second branch (Safed-Koh) has been assumed in the article Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n as the boundary of that region. Almost nothing is known of these mountains, except from the journey of Ferrier, who crossed all three watersheds in four days of July 1845. He describes the middle range as very lofty, with a good deal of snow on the pass; the southern range as not so high, the northern one as not nearly so high. The chief rivers, excluding the Oxus, are, beginning from the east: (1) the Aksaraj, with its tributary the river of Kund\u00faz; (2) the river of Khulm; (3) the Deh\u00e1s or Balkh river; (4) the rivers watering the Ch\u00e1r Wil\u00e1yat, viz. the Sir-i-p\u00fal-ab and the Sangalak, which lose themselves in the desert below Andkhoi; (5) the Murgh-\u00e1b, which, after flowing north-westward in the Paropamisus, turns northwards, reaching Merv, where formerly it formed a fertile oasis, the nucleus of ancient Margiana. Beyond this, it is lost in the desert.\n\nThe province of Balkh deserves special note. Balkh Proper is the populous and well-watered territory upon the eighteen canals which draw off the waters of the Balkh-\u00e1b, and on which there are said to be 360 villages. No trace has been discovered of the ancient splendours of Bactra, nor do the best judges appear to accept Ferrier's belief, that he saw cuneiform inscriptions upon bricks dug up there. Remains are scattered over some 20 miles of circuit, but they consist mainly of mosques and tombs of sun-dried brick, and show nothing even of early Muhammadan date. The inner city, surrounded by a ruined wall of 4 or 5 miles in compass, is now entirely deserted; a scanty population\nstill occupies a part of the outer city. In 1858, Muhammad Afzal Kh\u00e1n, ruling T\u00fark\u00edst\u00e1n on behalf of his father, Dost Mu\u1e25ammad, transferred the seat of the Afgh\u00e1n Government, and the bulk of the population, to Takht\u00e1pol, a position which he fortified, some 8 miles east of the old city; and this remains the capital of the Afgh\u00e1n territories on the Oxus.\n\nThe Population of Afgh\u00e1n T\u00fark\u00edst\u00e1n is estimated at 642,000, including 55,000 for Badakhsh\u00e1n, probably too low an estimate for the latter. The T\u00e1jiks, or people of Ir\u00e1nian blood, are probably the representatives of the oldest surviving race of this region. They are found in some districts of Balkh and valleys of Kund\u00faz. Khost, in Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n Proper, is also said to be chiefly occupied by them. Uzbegs seem to be the most numerous and ruling race; and there are some other T\u00fark tribes not classed as Uzbegs. There seem to be a good many families claiming Arab descent; Afgh\u00e1ns, especially about Balkh and Khulm; and in the towns some Hindus and Jews.\n\nProducts and Industry.\u2014Rock salt is worked at Chal, near the Badakhsh\u00e1n frontier, as well as beyond that frontier. Pistachio nuts are grown largely in the hill country of Kund\u00faz, together with the adjoining districts of Badakhsh\u00e1n, and the whole supply of India, Central Asia, and Russia is said to be derived from this region. Fruit is abundant and excellent, especially in Khulm and Balkh. Andkhoi, before its decay, was famous for the black sheepskins and lambskins which we call astrakh\u00e1n, and also for a breed of camels in great demand. Kund\u00faz produces a breed of horses, highly valued in the K\u00e1b\u00fal market under the name of Katagh\u00e1n. Maim\u00e1na also is famous for horses, which are often exported to India, and is a mart for carpets, and textures of wool and camel\u2019s hair, the work of T\u00farkom\u00e1n and J\u00e1msh\u00edd\u00ed women. Slave-dealing and man-stealing have long been the curse of this region, but late changes have tended to restrict them.\n\nHistory.\u2014Ancient Balkh, or Bactra, was probably one of the oldest capitals in Central Asia. There Persian tradition places the teaching of Zoroaster. Bactriana was a province of the Ach\u00e6menian empire, and probably was occupied in great measure by a race of Ir\u00e1nian blood. About b.c. 250, Theodotus, governor of Bactria, under the Seleucid\u00e6, declared his independence, and commenced the history, so dark to us, of the Gr\u00e6co-Bactrian dynasties, whose dominions at one time or another\u2014though probably never simultaneously\u2014touched the Jaxartes and the Gulf of Kachh (Cutch). Parthian rivalry first, and then a series of nomad movements from Inner Asia, overwhelmed the isolated dominion of the Greeks (circa b.c. 126). Powers rose on the Oxus, known to the Chinese as Yuechi, Kweishwang, Yetha, Tukh\u00e1ras, dimly identified in Western Asia and Europe, as Kush\u00e1ns, Hai\u00e1thala, Ephthalit\u00e6 or White Huns, and Tochari. Buddhism, with its monas-\nteries, colossi, and gilded pagodas, spread over the valley of the Oxus. We do not know what further traces of that time may yet be revealed; but we see some in the gigantic sculptures of B\u00e1mi\u00e1n. The old Arab historians of the Muhammadan conquest, celebrate a heathen temple at Balkh, called by them Naobih\u00e1r, which Sir Henry Rawlinson points out to have been certainly a Buddhist monastery (Nava-Vih\u00e1ra). The name Naobih\u00e1r still attaches to a village on one of the Balkh canals, thus preserving, through so many centuries, the memory of the ancient Indian religion. The memoirs of the Chinese pilgrim Hwen Thsang, in the first part of the 7th century, give many particulars of the prevalence of his religion in the numerous principalities into which the empire of the Tukh\u00e1ras had broken up; and it is remarkable how many of these states and their names are identical with those which still exist. This is not confined to what were great cities like Balkh and B\u00e1mi\u00e1n; it applies to Khulm, Khost, Baghl\u00e1n, Andar\u00e1b, and many more.\n\nAs Hai\u00e1thala, or Tokh\u00e1rist\u00e1n, the country long continued to be known to Muhammadans; its political destiny generally followed that of Khor\u00e1s\u00e1n. It bore the brunt of the fury of Ghinghiz, and the region seems never to have effectually recovered from the devastations and massacres which he began, and which were repeated in degree by succeeding generations. For about a century these Oxus provinces were attached to the empire of the Delhi Mughals, and then fell into Uzbeg hands. In the last century they formed a part of the dominion of Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1ni (see AFGHANISTAN), and so remained under his son Tim\u00far. But during the fratricidal wars of Tim\u00far's sons, they fell back under the independent rule of various Uzbeg chiefs. Among these, the Katagh\u00e1ns of Kund\u00faz were long predominant; and their chief Mur\u00e1d Beg (1815 to about 1842) for some time ruled K\u00fal\u00e1b beyond the Oxus, and all south of it from near Balkh to near P\u00e1m\u00edr.\n\nIn 1850 the \u00c1fgh\u00e1ns recovered Balkh and Khulm; by 1855 they had also gained Akcha and the four western kh\u00e1n\u00e1ts; Kund\u00faz in 1859. They were proceeding to extend their conquests to Badakhsh\u00e1n, when the Am\u00edr of that country agreed to pay homage and tribute.\n\nAntiquities.\u2014The best known, and probably the most remarkable, are the famous colossi at B\u00e1mi\u00e1n, with the adjoining innumerable caves. In the same locality are the ruins of the medi\u00e6val city destroyed by Ghinghiz, the great fort called Sayyid\u00e1b\u00e1d, and the ruins of Zoh\u00e1k. At Haibak are numerous caves like those of B\u00e1mi\u00e1n. Balkh seems to have little or nothing to show, though excavation would probably be rewarded. The little known or unknown valleys of Badakhsh\u00e1n contain remains of interest, but our only notices of them are so highly spiced with imagination as to be worthless.\nAfzalgarh.\u2014Town in Bijnaur (Bijnor) District, North-Western Provinces, on the left bank of the R\u00e1mganga. Lat. $29^\\circ 23' 51''$ N., long. $78^\\circ 43' 3''$ E. Distant from Calcutta 938 miles; from Nagina, 15 miles. Named after a Path\u00e1n chief, Naw\u00e1b Afzal Kh\u00e1n, who founded it during the brief domination of that race in Upper India (1748\u20131774). His brick fort was dismantled after the Mutiny of 1857, and is now quite in ruins. The town has decayed of late, and cultivation is encroaching upon its site. It has a small trade in forest timber and bamboos. A small colony of weavers manufacture excellent cotton cloths, described by Mr. Markham as \u2018almost equal to English,\u2019 some specimens of which obtained a prize and silver medal at the Agra Exhibition of 1867. Population (1881) 7797, comprising 5459 Muhammadans and 2341 Hindus. For conservancy and police purposes a small municipal tax is levied under the provisions of the Chaukid\u00e1ri Act (xx. of 1856). First-class police station; post-office.\n\nAgai.\u2014Town, Part\u00e1bgarh District, Oudh; 27 miles from Part\u00e1bgarh town, and 28 from R\u00e1i Bareli.

Government school.\n\nAgar.\u2014Petty State of the S\u00e1nkhera Mehv\u00e1s, in Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha, Bombay Presidency. Consists of 28 villages. Area, 17 square miles; estimated revenue in 1879, \u00a31000. The chief pays a yearly tribute of \u00a318 to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda.\n\nAgar.\u2014Town and pargan\u00e1 of the Gwalior State, under the Western Malwa agency of Central India. The town is situated on an open plain, 1675 feet above the sea, on the bank of a lake 3 miles in circumference. Distant 41 miles north-east of Ujjain, with which place it is connected by a metalled road. Lat. $23^\\circ 43' 30''$ N., long. $76^\\circ 4' 45''$ E. Population (1881) 6193. Fort with stone rampart. Agar is the headquarters of one of Sindhi\u00e1\u2019s revenue districts; he maintains no troops here, but the Central India Horse, consisting of 2 cavalry regiments (one of which is stationed at G\u00fana) under the command of English officers, has its head-quarters here. A horse and cattle fair is held here in the month of April.\n\nAgarp\u00e1r\u00e1.\u2014Town in the District of the 24 Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal, now known as the South Barrackpur municipality. Lat. $22^\\circ 41'$ N., and long. $88^\\circ 24' 57''$ E. Population (1881) 30,317, namely Hindus 21,952, Muhammadans 7490, and \u2018others\u2019 875.

Ten miles by the H\u00fagl\u00ed river from Calcutta.\n\nAgart\u00e1l\u00e1 (also called Natan Haveli or \u2018New Town\u2019).\u2014Capital of Hill Tipperah State, Bengal, and the occasional residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1; 38 miles north of Kumilla (Comillah), with which it is connected by a\nroad. Lat. $23^\\circ 50' 30''$ N., long. $91^\\circ 23' 5''$ E. A mere village, but increasing in size and importance. Population in 1881, 2144. Contains a palace of the R\u00e1j\u00e1, jail, police station, school, and hospital.\n\n**Agartal\u00e1, Old.**\u2014Village in Hill Tipperah State, Bengal, situated about 4 miles east of the present capital. Population (1881) 1186. Residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s until 1844, when the capital was removed to the new town. The ruins of the old palace still stand, together with some monuments to the R\u00e1j\u00e1s and R\u00e1n\u00eds. On some of these ruins new buildings have been erected, in which the R\u00e1j\u00e1 has generally resided since 1875. Adjacent to the palace is a small temple much venerated by the hillmen, and containing 14 heads of gold, silver, and other metals, which represent the tutelary gods of the Tipperahs. Every one who passes the temple is expected to bow his head.\n\n**Ag\u00e1shi.**\u2014Town and port in the Bassein Sub-division of Th\u00e1n\u00e1 (Tanna) District, Bombay Presidency, 10 miles north of Bassein, and 3\u00bd miles west of Vir\u00e1r Station on the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway, with which it is joined by a metalled road. Lat. $19^\\circ 27' 45''$ N., long. $72^\\circ 49' 30''$ E.; population (1881) 6823; Hindus numbering 5168, Christians 1500, and Muhammadans 155. Average annual value of trade at the port of Ag\u00e1shi, for five years ending 1879\u201380\u2014exports, \u00a331,847; imports, \u00a38565. Post-office. In the early part of the 16th century Ag\u00e1shi was a place of some importance, with a considerable timber and shipbuilding trade. It was twice sacked by the Portuguese\u2014in 1530, and again in 1531. In 1530, as many as 300 Guzer\u00e1t vessels are said to have been taken; and in 1540, the Portuguese captured a ship on the stocks at Ag\u00e1shi, and afterwards made several voyages to Europe. Ag\u00e1shi drives a great trade with Bombay in plantains and betel leaves, its dried plantains being the best in the District. There is a Portuguese school here, and a large temple of Bhav\u00e1n\u00ed-shankar, built in A.D. 1691, which enjoys a yearly grant from Government of \u00a35. The bathing place close to the temple has the reputation of effecting the cure of skin diseases.\n\n**Agastya-malai.**\u2014Mountain peak, 6200 feet above the sea, in the Ag\u00fasthivaram taluk, Travancore State, Madras Presidency. Lat. $8^\\circ 5' 30''$ N., long. $77^\\circ 33' 50''$ E. The Tambraparni river has its sources on this hill. Formerly an important astronomical station. The boundary between Travancore State and Tinneveli District runs over the hill.\n\n**Aghwanpur-Mughalpur.**\u2014Town in Morad\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Rohilkhand, North-Western Provinces. Population in 1881, 5277, namely Muhammadans 3003, and Hindus 3274.\n\n**Agoada Headland and Bay.**\u2014An inlet, and bold, bluff headland on the coast of Goa, Western India, in lat. $15^\\circ 29' 26\\cdot3''$ N., long. $73^\\circ 45' 55\\cdot1''$ E. The Agoada Head appears nearly flat-topped from\nseaward, and is about 260 feet high at its highest part, with a revolving light on its summit, 5 miles distant from Mormagao hill flagstaff. The construction of the Goa railway and the prospects of an important trade springing up at Mormagao, render it expedient to describe the Agoada headland in some detail. I condense the two following paragraphs from the Report of the Marine Survey, by Navigating Lieutenant Petley, R.N., in 1881.\n\nThe Agoada headland forms part of the north side of Agoada Bay, and is $1\\frac{3}{4}$ miles long east and west, but only half a mile wide at its greatest breadth north and south. The north side of the hill is joined to the mainland, which is here low and sandy and covered with cocoanut groves. The beach, which runs from the headland nearly due north, is also low and sandy, and has at all times a heavy surf breaking on it. The whole of the north side of the hill is fortified, as also a portion of the south and west sides. Where no fortifications have been built, the sides of the hill are inaccessible. The fortress, which is on the south side of the headland, is composed of a citadel on the crest of the hill, and a fort with barracks, etc., on the shore at the foot, the two being connected by an unfortified wall, with covered ways running up the sides of the hill. Within the citadel stands the lighthouse, and in the north-east bastion is a pillar marking a great trigonometrical station, while in the north-west bastion is a signal station with a flag-staff. This part of the fortress is surrounded by a deep moat cut out of the laterite rock. The lower fort, now used as a jail, is garrisoned by 60 officers and men, who form a guard over the military prisoners confined there. The saluting battery is outside the fort, as are also the houses of the commandant, customs officers, and pilots for the river. Immediately to the eastward of the fort is a small landing jetty where good water can be procured at any time of the tide.\n\nAgoada Bay, on the south side of Agoada head, is about $1\\frac{3}{4}$ miles long. At the head of the bay, and two miles east of Agoada lighthouse, is the entrance to the Mandovi river, which is narrowed by sandbanks on either side to only about one cable. The entrance to this river is protected on the north side by the fort of Reis Magos, which is built on the south-east extremity of Reis hill, and on the south side by the fort of Gaspar-dias, which bears from the former nearly due south, distant 8 cables. The shore between Agoada headland and Reis Magos fort is fringed with rocks for the greater part of the distance, extending farther off shore as the Reis Magos fort is approached, where they are dry at low water for a distance of three-quarters of a cable. Reis hill, 9 cables w.n.w. of Reis fort, is 150 feet high; its summit is bare, while the base and slopes of the hill are covered with cocoa-nut trees and jungle.\n\nAgra.\u2014Division or Commissionership in the North-Western Provinces, including the six Districts of Agra, Muttra, Farrukhabad,\nEtah, Etawah, and Mainpuri, all of which see separately. Lat. 26\u00b0 21' 30\" to 28\u00b0 1' 30\" N., long. 77\u00b0 19' 15\" to 80\u00b0 3' 15\" E. The Division is bounded on the north by Aligarh District; on the east by the Ganges which separates it from Bud\u00e1un and Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur Districts and from Oudh; on the south by Jal\u00e1un and Cawnpur Districts; and on the west by the native States of Bhartpur, Dholpur, and Gwalior. Area in 1881, 10,151 square miles. The Census of 1881 disclosed a population of 4,834,064, namely males 2,629,283, and females 2,204,781, residing in 8125 villages and inhabiting 681,482 houses; average density of population, 476\u00b72 per square mile; houses per square mile, 67\u00b71; persons per occupied house, 7\u00b72. Classified according to religion, the population consisted of\u2014Hindus, 4,377,955; Muhammadans, 422,460; Jains, 27,423; Christians, 6582; Sikhs, 534; Jew, 1; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 9.\n\nAgra.\u2014District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, lying between lat. 26\u00b0 44' 30\" and 27\u00b0 24' N., and between long. 77\u00b0 28' and 78\u00b0 53' 45\" E. Area (1881) 1850 square miles; population (1881) 974,656 souls. Agra is a District of the Division of the same name, and is bounded on the north by Muttra (Mathur\u00e1) and Etah, on the east by Mainpuri and Etawah, on the south by Dholpur and Gwalior States, and on the west by Bhartpur State. The administrative head-quarters are at the city of Agra.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of Agra is an artificial administrative division, including territory on either bank of the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1), which runs obliquely through its midst and divides it into two unequal portions. The northern and smaller section forms a part of the Do\u00e1b, or great alluvial plain between the Ganges and the Jumna. Its interior consists of the level and unbroken plateau which characterises the whole of that monotonous tract. The soil is a rich and productive loam, irrigated with water from the Ganges canals, and varied only by narrow ridges of sandy hillocks or barren stretches of saline \u00fasar plain. But as we descend towards the Jumna river, we encounter a broad belt of branching ravines, deeply scored by the torrents which carry off the surface drainage in the rainy season, and either totally bare of vegetation or covered with bab\u00fal trees and scrub jungle. At the foot of this uncultivated slope lies a narrow strip of kh\u00e1dir or modern alluvial deposit, which produces rich crops of wheat and sugar-cane without the necessity for artificial irrigation. The southern and larger portion of the District, lying on the west bank of the Jumna, presents the same general characteristics as the Do\u00e1b region, except that it is even more minutely intersected by ramifying ravines. The Utanghan traverses the heart of this portion, while its southern boundary is formed by the large and turbulent stream of the Chambal, whose volume often surpasses that of the Jumna itself. From either river a network of gorges spreads\nupwards towards the alluvial plateau above. This plateau maintains the general level of the Gangetic plain till it meets, on the south-western border of the District, a low range of sandstone hills, the farthest outliers of the great Vindhyan ridge. The narrow strip of land enclosed between the three main channels of the Jumna, the Chambal, and the Utanghan, consists almost entirely of ravines and the small patches of level ground which divide them. The north-western pargan\u00e1s, however, present a wider expanse of unbroken ground, through which the Agra Canal distributes its fertilizing waters. The city of Agra itself is situated on the west bank of the Jumna, about the centre of the District. It contains the famous mausoleum of the T\u00e1j Mahal, and many other works of architectural interest, details of which will be found in the account of Agra City.\n\nHistory. \u2014 The District of Agra has scarcely any history, apart from that of the city. The Lodhi kings of Delhi had a residence on the east bank of the Jumna, which was occupied by B\u00e1bar after his victory over Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Kh\u00e1n in 1526. Its foundations are still to be seen opposite the modern Agra. B\u00e1bar fought a great and decisive battle with the R\u00e1jputs near Fatehpur Sikri in 1527. His son Hum\u00e1yun also resided at old Agra, until his expulsion in 1540. Akbar lived in the District for the greater part of his reign, and founded the present city of Agra on the west bank. The town of Fatehpur Sikri also owes its origin to the same Emperor, and dates back to the year 1570. A tank of twenty miles in circumference, which he constructed in its neighbourhood, can now be traced only in the fragmentary ruins of the embankment. The mausoleum at Sikandra, five miles from Agra, marks the burial-place of the great Mughal organizer. It was built by his son Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, and has a fine entrance archway of red sandstone. Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, however, deserted Agra towards the close of his reign, and spent the greater part of his time in the Punjab and K\u00e1b\u00fal. Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n removed the seat of the imperial court to Delhi, but continued the construction of the T\u00e1j and the other architectural monuments to which the city owes much of its fame. After the successful rebellion of Aurangzeb against his father Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, the deposed Emperor was assigned a residence at Agra. From the year 1666, the District dwindled into the seat of a provincial governor, and was often attacked by the J\u00e1ts. During the long decline of the Mughal power, the annals of the District are uneventful; but in 1764 Agra was taken by the J\u00e1ts of Bhartpur under S\u00faraj Mall and Walter Reinhardt, better known by his native name of Samru. In 1770 the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s overran the whole Doab; but were expelled by the imperial forces under Najaf Kh\u00e1n in 1773. The J\u00e1ts then recovered Agra for a while, and were driven out in turn by Najaf Kh\u00e1n in the succeeding year. After passing\nthrough the usual convulsions which marked the end of the last century in Upper India, the District came into the hands of the British by the victories of Lord Lake in 1803. Under our strong and peaceful government, the annals of Agra call for no special notice up to the date of the Mutiny. The city was long the seat of government for the North-Western Provinces, and remained so until the events of 1857. The outbreak of the Mutiny at Agra in May of that year will be related under AGRA CITY. As regards the District, the tahsils and th\u00e1n\u00e1s fell into the hands of the rebels, after the defection of the Gwalior contingent, on the 15th of June. By the 2nd of July the N\u00edmach (Neemuch) and Nasir\u00e1b\u00e1d (Nusseerabad) mutineers had reached Fatehpur Sikri, and the whole District became utterly disorganized. On the 29th, however, an expedition from Agra recovered that post, and another sally restored order in the Ihtim\u00e1dpur and Firoz\u00e1b\u00e1d pargan\u00e1s. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Awah maintained tranquillity in the north, while the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bhad\u00e1war secured peace on the eastern border. But after the fall of Delhi in September, the rebels from that city, joined by the bands from Central India, advanced towards Agra on the 6th of October. Four days later, Colonel Greathed\u2019s column from Delhi entered Agra without the knowledge of the mutineers, who incautiously attacked the city, and hopelessly shattered themselves against his well-tried force. They were put to flight easily and all their guns taken. The rebels still occupied Fatehpur Sikri, but a column despatched against that post successfully dislodged them. On the 20th of November, the last villages remaining in open rebellion were stormed and carried; and on the 4th of February 1858, the last man still under arms was driven out of the District.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1853 returned the total inhabitants of Agra District at 1,001,961. The population in 1872, according to the Census of that year, but allowing for recent transfers, which have decreased the area from 1907 to 1849 square miles, was 1,076,005. The latest Census in 1881 (area 1849 square miles) returned a total population of 974,656, showing a decrease of 101,349, or 9\u00b742 per cent. in the nine years. The male population in 1881 numbered 526,801, and the female, 447,855; proportion of males 55\u00b75 per cent. Average density of population, 526\u00b78; number of towns and villages, 1201; number of occupied houses, 165,439; number of villages per square mile, 0\u00b764; houses per square mile, 89\u00b74; inmates per occupied house, 5\u00b78. As regards the religious distinctions of the people, 857,957, or 88\u00b70 per cent., were returned as Hindus, and 99,809, or 10\u00b72 per cent., as Musalm\u00e1ns. There were also 11,476 Jains, 409 Sikhs, 4997 Christians, and 8 P\u00e1rs\u00eds. The three higher castes of Hindus numbered 123,847 Br\u00e1hmans, 94,144 R\u00e1jputs, and 50,323 Bani\u00e1s. Among the lower castes, Ah\u00edrs amounted to 37,839, Cham\u00e1rs\nto 152,656, K\u00e1yasths to 11,093, J\u00e1ts to 57,461, Kachh\u00eds to 45,640, Lohs to 24,007, Koris to 29,719, Kumbhars to 15,448, Mallas to 21,018, and N\u00e1is to 19,559. The Musalm\u00e1ns were divided into 97,818 Sunnis and 1991 Shi\u00e1s. The rural classes live almost entirely in mud huts; but in the south-west of the District, near the quarries, stone houses are common, and even the poorer people live in cottages of unhewn stone roughly piled together. Dwellings with a large court-yard, accommodating many families, and surrounded by a ditch enclosing a mud wall, are known as garhs or forts. They were dotted all over the country in Hindu and Muhammadan times.\n\nThe District contained, in 1881, six towns with a population exceeding 5000 souls\u2014namely, Agra, 141,188; Firoz\u00e1b\u00e1d, 16,023; T\u00e1jganj (suburb of Agra City), 12,570; Sh\u00e1hganj (also a suburb of Agra), 6445; Fatehpur S\u00edkri, 6243; and Pin\u00e1hat, 5697. These figures show a total urban population of 188,166 souls, as against 769,490 forming the rural population. Of the total of 1201 villages and towns, 219 contain less than two hundred inhabitants; 445 from two to five hundred; 320 from five hundred to one thousand; 152 from one to two thousand; 44 from two to three thousand; 15 from three to five thousand; 3 from five to ten thousand; 1 from ten to fifteen thousand; 1 from fifteen to twenty thousand; and 1 with upwards of a hundred thousand inhabitants. As regards occupation, the Census Report of 1881 classifies the male population into the following six great divisions:\n\n\u2014Class 1. Professional class, including the military, Government, and other officials, and the learned professions, 13,168; (2) domestic class, including household servants and lodging-house keepers, 7909; (3) commercial class, including merchants, traders, and carriers, 15,786; (4) agricultural class, including cultivators, gardeners, and sheep and cattle tenders, 208,183; (5) industrial class, including artisans, 90,191; (6) indefinite and non-productive class (including 20,986 general labourers, 13 persons of rank and property without office or occupation, and 170,565 male children), 191,564.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014In the Do\u00e1b, the soil is generally rich and fertile, but elsewhere its productiveness is much impaired by the prevalence of ravines. Their detrimental influence extends far beyond the area actually occupied by their sloping sides; for wherever any declivity begins, the surface soil is washed away, leaving scarcely enough mould for seed to germinate in; while nearer to the actual declivity a belt of sandy loam occurs, where the produce is always poor and uncertain. The kh\u00e1dir or low-lying silt, however, which stretches between the ravines and the river-sides, is usually rich and fruitful. The course of agriculture does not differ from that which is common throughout the whole upper Gangetic plain. The crops are divided into the kharif or autumn harvest and the rabi or spring harvest. The kharif crops\nare sown after the first rain in June, and reaped in October or November. They consist of bajra, joar, moth, and other food-grains; and cotton, which is not ready for picking till November. The rabi crops are sown in October or November, and reaped in March and April. They consist of wheat, barley, oats, peas and other pulses. Manure is used, where it can be obtained, for both harvests; land is allowed to lie fallow whenever the cultivator can afford it; and sometimes from paucity of labourers. As a rule, the same soil is not planted for both spring and autumn harvests in a single year, but occasionally a crop of early rice is taken off a plot in August, and some other seed sown in its place for the spring reaping. Rotation of crops is practised in its simplest form; autumn staples alternate with spring, wheat and barley being substituted for cotton and bajra, while gram takes the place of joar. Sugar-cane, tobacco, indigo, poppy, and vegetables are also grown. The total area under cultivation in 1880-81 was 731,708 acres; of which 23,045 acres were irrigated by Government works, 159,408 acres were irrigated by private individuals, and 549,255 acres were unirrigated. The uncultivated area consisted of 191,410 acres of grazing and cultivable land, and of 202,485 acres of uncultivable waste. Total assessed area, 1,125,603 acres or 1759 square miles. Gross amount of Government assessment, \u00a3178,884; average per acre of cultivation, 4s. 10\u00bdd., or per acre of cultivated and cultivable land, 3s. 10\u00bdd. The total amount of rent, including cesses, paid by the cultivators in 1881 was \u00a3319,528, or an average of 8s. 2d. per cultivated acre. Agriculturists form 56\u00b761 per cent. of the total population, the area of cultivable and cultivated land being 1\u00b774 acre per head of the agricultural population. From the statistics of out-turn during the last quarter of a century, it appears that the amount of cotton and superior cereals has been greatly on the increase; but as additional land has been brought under tillage at the same time, there has been no corresponding diminution in the growth of cheaper food-grains. Most of the cultivators are badly off and in debt. Even the landowners are far from rich, owing to the minute subdivision of property. In the greater number of cases the tenants possess rights of occupancy. Wages rule generally as follows: Coolies and unskilled labourers, 2\u00bcd. to 3\u00bcd. per diem; agricultural labourers, 2\u00bcd. to 3d. per diem; bricklayers and carpenters, 6d. to 2s. per diem. Women are paid about one-fifth less than men, while children receive from one-third to one-half the wages of adults. The average prices current of food-stuffs are about as follow: Wheat, 25 sers per rupee, or 4s. 6d. per cwt.; rice, 7 sers per rupee, or 16s. per cwt.; joar, 30 sers per rupee, or 3s. 9d. per cwt.; bajra, 30 sers per rupee, or 3s. 9d. per cwt. Both wages and prices have risen 15 or 20 per cent. in the last thirty-five years.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014The District suffers much in periods of\ndrought, as it depends largely on natural rainfall for its water supply. Famines from this cause occurred in 1783, in 1813, in 1819, and in 1838. In the last-named year as many as 113,000 paupers were being relieved at one time in Agra city alone, while 300,000 starving people immigrated into the District in search of work or charity. Prosperity returned very slowly, and for many years traces of the famine might be observed on every side. In 1860\u201361 the District was again visited by a severe scarcity, though it did not suffer so greatly as the country immediately to the north. In April 1861, 18,000 persons were employed on relief works, and 2000 on irrigation works; in July, the daily average so occupied had risen to 66,000. Wheat rose to 10 sers per rupee or 11s. 2d. per cwt. in September 1860, but fell again to 15 sers, or 7s. 6d., by July 1861; and the effects of this famine were not so severe or so lasting as those of the drought of 1837\u201338. The last great scarcity was that of 1868\u201369. The failure of rain in the autumn of the former year destroyed the kharif crops, and confined the spring sowings to irrigated lands. The rabi was saved by rain in January and February; but distress began to be felt from September 1868. The famine was never really dangerous in the District itself, as rain fell in the west; but crowds of fugitives trooped in from the Native States of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, bringing want and disease in their train. Work was found for the able-bodied on the Agra Canal, while gratuitous support was afforded by Government to women and invalids. Distress (which was again severely felt in 1877\u201378) becomes serious in this District when the scarcity of the cheap autumn food-stuffs forces labouring people to consume the better and more expensive grains of the spring crops. When prices rise to a rate of 12 or 13 sers per rupee (8s. 7d. to 9s. 4d. per cwt.), they are beyond the purchasing power of the labourer, and famine is reached.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The trade of the District centres mainly in the city of Agra. There are, however, several indigo factories and two cotton screws in the rural parts, besides the usual village manufactures of pottery and coarse cloth. Large cattle markets are held at Sult\u00e1npur, Kandharpur, Jarra, and Shams\u00e1b\u00e1d. The chief commercial fair is that of Batesar, on the right bank of the Jumna, at which about 150,000 persons attend the Bathing Festival, and a great trade is transacted in horses, camels, and cattle. Large quantities of stone are quarried in the south-west of the District, and exported by the Jumna, after being dressed and carved at Agra. The system of communications is excellent. The East Indian main line of railway runs through the whole Do\u00e1b section, with stations at Firoz\u00e1b\u00e1d, T\u00fandla, and Barhan; and sends out a branch from T\u00fandla to Agra, which crosses the Jumna by a bridge belonging to the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na State Railway. The latter line runs from Agra to Bombay, via Bhartpur,\nJaipur and Ajmer, and has a length of 20 miles within the District. The Sindhia State Railway leaves the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na line at Agra, and, after crossing the Utanghan and Chambal, proceeds to Gwalior, via Dholpur. Muttra is connected with Agra by a line of railway on the narrow gauge leaving the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na railway at Achnera in Agra District. By means of this branch, the Hathr\u00e1s and Muttra railway is brought into communication with the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na system. The city of Agra is thus the railway centre to which the various lines converge, as well as the commercial entrep\u00f4t of the District. Good metalled roads connect Agra with Muttra, Al\u00edgarh, Cawnpur, Et\u00e1wah, Gwalior, Karauli, Fatehpur Sikri, and Bhartpur. The Agra Canal has one navigable channel, and the Jumna still carries a large amount of heavy traffic eastward. A daily English newspaper, the Delhi Gazette, is published at Agra city. There were also in 1880\u201381 three vernacular papers, the Agra Akhbar, the Haiyat-i-Jaw\u00edd\u00e1n\u00ed and the N\u00e1s\u00edm-i-Agra, besides five vernacular periodicals, and twelve private printing presses.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The District staff varies according to administrative exigencies, but consists normally of a Collector-Magistrate, one or two Joint Magistrates, an Assistant, and two uncovenanted Deputies, besides the usual fiscal, medical, and constabulary establishment. Agra is the head-quarters of a civil and sessions judge, who has also jurisdiction in Muttra. In 1880\u201381 there were 20 civil and revenue judges, and 25 officers with magisterial jurisdiction. The whole amount of imperial revenue raised in the District in 1880\u201381 amounted to \u00a3227,788, being at the rate of 4s. 8d. per head of the population. Total cost of officials and police of all kinds, \u00a330,777. In 1880\u201381 the regular District police force consisted of 744 officers and men, besides 431 employed in towns or municipalities, and a cantonment police of 68 men; total strength of police force, 1243. These figures give an average of 1 policeman to every 1\u00b752 square mile of area and to every 800 persons of the population. There was also a rural police consisting of 2160 village and 98 road patrol chaukid\u00e1rs. The District contains the Central Jail for the Division, the average number of prisoners in which, during the year 1880\u201381, amounted to 2082\u00b741, of whom 1937\u00b727 were males and 145\u00b714 females. The average cost per head was \u00a33, 3s. 3d.; average earnings of each hard labour prisoner, \u00a34, 12s. od. There is also a District jail, which contained in the same year a daily average of 501\u00b703 prisoners, all of whom were males. The average cost per prisoner was \u00a33, 4s. 8\u00bdd., and the average earnings of each prisoner \u00a31, 10s. Two lock-ups in the civil station and cantonments contained in 1880\u201381 a daily average of 45\u00b750 prisoners, of whom 2\u00b725 were females. Seven main lines of telegraph leave the Agra station\u2014to Al\u00edgarh, Bhartpur, Cawnpur, Dholpur, Muttra, and the two railways. There are also telegraph offices at all the stations.\non the East Indian and Rajputana lines. The District contains 17 imperial and 12 local post-offices, with a tendency to increase. Such figures, without a date attached to them, should be taken throughout these volumes as usually below the present facts. The total number of Government and aided schools in Agra District in 1880-81 was 245, attended by 7683 pupils, being at the rate of 1 school to every 7'53 square miles. There are, however, a number of private schools, unaided and uninspected; and the Census Report of 1881 returned 9391 males and 976 females as being under instruction, and 31,776 males and 1248 females as not under instruction, but able to read and write. Four institutions for higher education exist at Agra\u2014namely, the Government College, St. John's College, St. Peter's College, and Victoria College. The Sikandra Orphanage School is an excellent institution, which, in addition to affording education, has a well-managed industrial department. Those who wish to continue their English studies are drafted to St. John's College, and many such are now employed as teachers and clerks in different parts of the country. Most of the boys, however, take to handicrafts; and smiths and carpenters trained here, find ready employment on the different railways. The institution also supplies trained proof readers, compositors, pressmen, bookbinders, tailors, gardeners, and domestic servants. In the girls' branch, needlework and useful domestic arts are taught. Anglo-veracular schools are established at Agra and Fatehpur Sikri. For fiscal purposes the District is divided into seven tahsils and seven parganas. The land revenue in 1880-81 amounted to \u00a3178,395. Agra contains three municipalities\u2014namely, Agra, Fatehpur Sikri, and Firozabad. In 1881-82 their joint income amounted to \u00a320,875, and their united expenditure to \u00a320,408. The incidence of municipal taxation was at the rate of 2s. 3\u00bdd. per head of the population within the municipal boundaries.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014Agra District, from its proximity to the sandy deserts on the west, is very dry, and suffers from greater extremes of temperature than the country farther east. Though cold in winter and exceedingly hot in summer, the climate is not considered unhealthy. Mean annual temperature is about 75\u00b0 F.; lowest monthly average about 59\u00b0 in January, and the highest, 95\u00b0 in June. The following are the official figures for 1880-81: Highest maximum, 116\u00b07\u00b0 in June; lowest minimum, 39\u00b06\u00b0 in January; mean maximum, 91\u00b06\u00b0; mean minimum, 68\u00b07\u00b0; general mean, 80\u00b02\u00b0. Average annual rainfall, 26'46 inches; rainfall in 1880-81, 15'72 inches, or 10'74 inches below the average. There are six charitable dispensaries in the District,\u2014four in Agra, and one at Fatehpur Sikri and at Firozabad. There are also a leper asylum and poorhouse at Agra city. [For further information regarding Agra District, see the Agra Settlement Report,\nAgra.\u2014Tahsil of Agra District, North-Western Provinces, lying along the river Jumna, and containing the great city from which it derives its name. Area, 206 square miles, of which 143 are cultivated. Population (1881) 266,206; land revenue, \u00a322,846; total revenue, \u00a339,009; rent paid by cultivators, \u00a343,657. The tahsil contains five civil and twelve revenue courts, with a regular police force of 533 officers and men, distributed at eleven police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); number of chaukid\u00e1rs or village watchmen, 313.\n\nAgra.\u2014Chief city of Agra District, North-Western Provinces. Lat. 27\u00b0 10' 6\" N., long. 78\u00b0 5' 4\" E.; population in 1881, including cantonments and the suburbs of T\u00e1jganj and Sh\u00e1hganj, 160,203. Agra is the second city in size and importance in the North-Western Provinces (excluding Lucknow, in Oudh), and is situated on the right bank of the river Jumna, about 300 miles above its confluence with the Ganges. Distance by rail from Calcutta, 841 miles; from Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, 277 miles; and from Delhi, 139 miles.\n\nSite and Area.\u2014The city of Agra occupies a bend of the Jumna, where the stream turns sharply to the east. The fort is perched in the angle thus formed, on the edge of the bank. In the rainy season, one side of it overhangs the swollen river. The old walls enclosed an area of about 11 square miles, half of which is now inhabited, while the remainder consists of ruins, ravines, and bare patches of open ground. The cantonments lie to the south of the fort, and between them on the river bank a little eastward rises the famous mausoleum of the T\u00e1j Mahal. North-west of the fort stretch the buildings connected with the civil station: while between the station and the Jumna lies the native city, better built than any other town in the North-Western Provinces, and containing a much larger proportion of stone houses. The site is generally level, but a few ravines intersect the European quarter and the native city, while the space between the T\u00e1j and the fort is a mass of tangled gorges, running southward in the direction of the cantonments. Agra is a well-built and handsome town, and its numerous architectural works, as well as the prominent part which it bore in Mughal history, give it a lasting interest to the tourist and the student.\n\nHistory.\u2014Before the time of Akbar, Agra had been a residence of the Lodhi kings, whose city, however, lay on the left or eastern bank of the Jumna. Traces of its foundations may still be noticed opposite the modern town. B\u00e1har occupied its old palace after his victory over Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Kh\u00e1n in 1526; and when, a year later, he defeated\nthe R\u00e1jput forces near Fatehpur S\u00edkri and securely established the Mughal supremacy, he took up his permanent residence at this place. Here he died in 1530; but his remains were removed to K\u00e1b\u00fal, so that no mausoleum preserves his memory amongst the tombs of the dynasty whose fortunes he founded for a second time. His son Hum\u00e1yun was for a time driven out of the Ganges valley by Sher Sh\u00e1h, the rebel Afgh\u00e1n Governor of Bengal, and after his re-establishment on the throne he fixed his court at Delhi. Hum\u00e1yun was succeeded by his son Akbar, the great organizer of the imperial system. Akbar removed the seat of government to the present Agra, which he founded on the right bank of the river, and built the fort in 1566. Four years later, he laid the foundations of Fatehpur S\u00edkri, and contemplated making that town the capital of his empire, but was dissuaded, apparently, by the superior advantages of Agra, situated as it was on the great waterway of the Jumna. From 1570 to 1600, Akbar was occupied with his conquests to the south and east; but in 1601 he rested from his wars, and returned to Agra, where he died four years later. During his reign, the palaces in the fort were commenced, and the gates of Chittor were set up at Agra. The Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr succeeded his father, whose mausoleum he built at S\u00edkandra. He also erected the tomb of his father-in-law, Itm\u00e1d-ud-daul\u00e1, on the left bank of the river, as well as the portion of the palace in the fort known as the Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr Mahal. In 1618, he left Agra and never returned. Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n was proclaimed Emperor at Agra in 1628, and resided here from 1632 to 1637. It is to his reign that most of the great architectural works in the fort must be referred, though doubtless many of them had been commenced at an earlier date. The Mot\u00ed Masjid, or Pearl Mosque, the Jam\u00e1 Masjid, or Great Mosque, and the Kh\u00e1s Mahal, were all completed under this magnificent Emperor. The T\u00e1j Mahal, generally allowed to be the most exquisite piece of Muhammadan architecture in the world, commemorates his wife, Mumt\u00e1z-i-Mahal.\n\nIn 1658 Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n\u2019s fourth son, Aurangzeb, rebelled and deposed him; but the ex-emperor was permitted to live in imperial state, but in confinement, at Agra for seven years longer. After his death, Agra sank for a while to the position of a provincial city, as Aurangzeb removed the seat of government permanently to Delhi. It had often to resist the attacks of the turbulent J\u00e1ts during the decline of the Mughals; and in 1764 it was actually taken by the Bhartpur forces under S\u00faraj Mall and the Swiss renegade Walter Reinhardt, better known by his native name of Samru. In 1770, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s ousted the J\u00e1ts, and were themselves driven out by the imperial troops under Najaf Kh\u00e1n four years later. Najaf Kh\u00e1n then resided in the city for many years with great state as imperial minister. After his death in 1779, Muhammad Beg was governor\nof Agra; and in 1784 he was besieged by the forces of the Emperor Sh\u00e1h Alam and Madhuj\u00ed Sindhia, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 prince. Sindhia took Agra, and held it till 1787, when he was in turn attacked by the imperial troops under Jhulam K\u00e1dir and Ism\u00e1il Beg. The partisan General de Boigne raised the siege by defeating them near Fatehpur Sikri in June 1788. Thenceforward the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s held the fort till it was taken by Lord Lake in October 1803. From this time it remained a British frontier fortress; and in 1835 the seat of government for the North-Western Provinces was removed here from Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. The English rule continued undisturbed until the Mutiny of 1857. News of the outbreak at Meerut reached Agra on the 11th of May, and the fidelity of the native soldiers at once became suspected. On the 30th of May two companies of Native Infantry, belonging to the 44th and 67th Regiments, who had been despatched to Muttra to escort the treasure into Agra, proved mutinous, and marched off to Delhi. Next morning their comrades were ordered to pile arms, and sullenly obeyed. Most of them then quietly retired to their own homes. The Mutiny at Gwalior took place on the 15th of June, and it became apparent immediately that the Gwalior contingent at Agra would follow the example of their countrymen. On the 3rd of July the Government found it necessary to retire into the fort. Two days later the N\u00edmach (Neemuch) and Nasir\u00e1b\u00e1d (Nusseerabad) rebels advanced towards Agra, and were met by the small British force at Sucheta. Our men were compelled to retire after a brisk engagement; and the mob of Agra, seeing the English troops unsuccessful, rose at once, plundered the city, and murdered every Christian, European or native, upon whom they could lay their hands. The blaze of the bungalows was seen by our retreating troops even before they reached the shelter of the fort. The mutineers, however, moved on to Delhi without entering the town; and on the 8th, partial order was restored in Agra. During the months of June, July, and August, the officials remained shut up in the fort, though occasional raids were made against the rebels in different directions. The Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces (John Colvin), the seat of whose government lay at Agra, was one of the officers thus shut up. He died during those months of trouble, and his tomb now forms a graceful specimen of Christian sculpture within the fort of the Mughals. After the fall of Delhi in September, the fugitives from that city, together with the rebels from Central India, advanced against Agra on October the 6th. Meanwhile, Col. Greathed\u2019s column from Delhi entered the city without the knowledge of the mutineers, who unsuspectingly attacked his splendid force, and were repulsed, after a short contest, which completely broke up their array. Agra was immediately relieved from all danger, and the work of reconstituting the District went on unmolested. The\nGovernment continued to occupy the former capital until February 1858, when it removed to Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, which was considered a superior military position. Since that time Agra has become, for administrative purposes, merely the head-quarters of a Division and District; but the ancient capital still maintains its natural supremacy as the finest city of Upper India, while the development of the railway system, of which it forms a great centre, is gradually rendering it once more the commercial metropolis of the North-West.\n\nArchitectural Works.\u2014Most of the magnificent Mughal buildings, which render Agra so interesting in the eye of the traveller, are situated within the limits of Akbar\u2019s fort. They illustrate and justify the criticism, that the Mughals designed like Titans and finished like jewellers. Their bare outlines can alone be indicated in this article. But a description of rare literary charm and architectural value will be found in Mr. Fergusson\u2019s History of Indian Architecture (ed. 1876). Mr. H. G. Keene\u2019s Handbook to Agra will be found a useful guide. The fortress is built of sandstone, and its vast red walls and flanking defences give it an imposing appearance as viewed either from the land or the water. The oldest structures within its lines are composed of the same red stone, and date from the reign of Akbar. In front of the main entrance there used to be a walled square or place d\u2019armes, known as the Tripolia, which has now been dismantled, and the ground is occupied by a railway station. Facing the gateway, and outside the enclosure of the fort, stands the Jam\u00e1 Masjid, or Great Mosque, elevated upon a raised platform, and reached by a broad flight of steps.\n\nThe Jam\u00e1 Masjid of Agra.\u2014The main building of the mosque is divided into three compartments, each of which opens on the courtyard by a fine archway, and is surrounded by a low dome, built of white and red stone in oblique courses, and producing a somewhat singular though pleasing effect. The work has all the originality and vigour of the early Mughal style, mixed with many reminiscences of the Path\u00e1n school. The inscription over the main archway sets forth that the mosque was constructed by the Emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n in 1644, after five years\u2019 labour. It was built in the name of his daughter, Jah\u00e1n\u00e1ra, who afterwards devotedly shared her father\u2019s captivity when he was deposed by Aurangzeb. This is the noble-hearted and pious princess, whose tomb lies near the poet Khusrus, outside Delhi. It is a cenotaph of pure white marble, with only a little grass, religiously planted and watered by successive generations, growing at one end of the slab. The adjacent Persian inscription records the last wish of this devoted lady: \u2018Let no rich canopy surmount my grave. This grass is the best covering for the tomb of the poor in spirit; the humble and transitory Jah\u00e1n\u00e1ra, the disciple of the holy men of Ch\u00edst, the daughter of the Emperor\nSh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n.' The splendid Jam\u00e1 Masjid at Agra is the public memorial of this princess, whose modest grave lies near Delhi. The dimensions of the Agra mosque are 130 feet in length by 100 in breadth.\n\nThe Fort.\u2014From the Jam\u00e1 Masjid we cross the square to the fortress, whose walls are 70 feet high, and a mile and a half in circuit; but as they are only faced with stone, and consist within of sand and rubble, they have no real strength, and would crumble at once before the fire of modern artillery. A drawbridge leads across the deep moat which surrounds the crenelated ramparts, and gives access, through a massive gateway and up a paved ascent, to the inner portal. The actual entrance is flanked by two octagonal towers of red sandstone, inlaid with ornamental designs in white marble; the passage between them being covered by two domes, and known as the Delhi gate. Within it, beyond a bare space once occupied by a courtyard, lie the palace buildings, the first of which is known as the Diw\u00e1n-i-\u00e1m, or Hall of Public Audience, formerly used as an armory. It was built by Aurangzeb in 1685, and did duty as an imperial hall and court-house for the palace. The roof is supported by colonnades, which somewhat impair the effect of the interior. This hall opens on a large court or tilt-yard: and while the Emperor with his grandees sat in the open hall, the general public occupied three of the cloisters. A raised throne accommodated the sovereign, behind which a door communicated with the private apartments of the palace. The Diw\u00e1n-i-\u00e1m has been of recent years vulgarized by hasty decorations: its pillars and arches covered with white stucco, feebly picked out with gilt lines. The main range of buildings does not belong to Akbar's time, but was built by his son and grandson. The centre consists of a great court, 500 feet by 370, surrounded by arcades, and approached at opposite ends through a succession of corridors opening into one another. The Diw\u00e1n-i-\u00e1m is on one side, and behind it are two smaller enclosures, the one containing the Diw\u00e1n-i-kh\u00e1s, and the other the harem. Three sides were occupied by the residences of the ladies, and the fourth by three white pavilions. The Diw\u00e1n-i-kh\u00e1s, or Hall of Private Audience, consists of two corridors, 64 feet long, 34 feet broad, and 22 feet high, both built in 1637. It is being repaired in a spirit of fidelity to the original, although it is still unfortunately in the hands of the workmen, and littered with their materials and tools (1884). The Machi Bh\u00e1wan, or court between these and the Diw\u00e1n-i-\u00e1m, was probably built by Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n. On the river side of this court are two thrones, one of white marble and the other of black slate. The sub-structures of the palace are of red sandstone, but the corridors, rooms, and pavilions are of white marble elaborately carved. Next to the Diw\u00e1n-i-kh\u00e1s comes the Shish Mahal, or Palace of Glass, which was an oriental bath adorned with thousands of small mirrors. To the south, again, lies a large red building called the Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr Mahal, with a fine\ntwo-storied fa\u00e7ade and relieving lines of white marble; one of the inner courts is 70 feet square, and both are of red stone. Between them is a handsome entrance on pillars. The Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr Mahal presents some admirable examples of Hindu carving, with projecting brackets as supports to the broad eaves and to the architraves between the pillars, which take the place of arches. This Hindu form is adopted in the Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr Mahal and in the neighbouring Samam Bh\u00farj instead of the arch; and the ornamentation of the former is purely Hindu. The exquisite Mot\u00ed-Masjid, or Pearl Mosque, stands to the north of the Diw\u00e1n-i-\u00e1m. It is raised upon a lofty sandstone platform, and has three domes of white marble with gilded spires. The domes crown a corridor open towards the court and divided into three aisles by a triple row of Saracenic arches. The Pearl Mosque is 142 feet long by 56 feet high, and was built by Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n in 1654. It is much larger than the Pearl Mosque at Delhi; and its pure white marble, sparingly inlaid with black lines, has an effect at once noble and refined. Only in the praying oblongs on the floor is colour employed\u2014a delicate yellow inlaid into the white marble. There is, however, in the Agra Fort a second and much smaller Pearl Mosque, which was reserved for the private devotions of the Emperors. This exquisite miniature house of prayer is entirely of the finest and whitest marble, without gilding or inlaying of any sort.\n\nThe T\u00e1j Mahal with its beautiful domes, \u2018a dream in marble,\u2019 rises on the river bank. It is reached from the fort by the Strand Road, made in the famine of 1838, and adorned with stone gh\u00e1ts by native gentlemen. The T\u00e1j was erected as a mausoleum for the remains of Arjamand Benu Begam, wife of the Emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, and known as Mumt\u00e1z-i-Mahal, or Exalted of the Palace. She died in 1629, and this building was set on foot soon after her death, though not completed till 1648. The materials are white marble from Jaipur, and red sandstone from Fatehpur S\u00edkri. The complexity of its design and the delicate intricacy of the workmanship baffle description. The mausoleum stands on a raised marble platform, at each of whose corners rises a tall and slender minaret of graceful proportions and exquisite beauty. Beyond the platform stretch the two wings, one of which is itself a mosque of great architectural merit. In the centre of the whole design, the mausoleum occupies a square of 186 feet, with the angles deeply truncated, so as to form an unequal octagon. The main feature of this central pile is the great dome, which swells upward to nearly two-thirds of a sphere, and tapers at its extremity into a pointed spire, crowned by a crescent. Beneath it, an enclosure of marble trellis-work surrounds the tombs of the princess, and of her husband, the Emperor. Each corner of the mausoleum is covered by a similar though much smaller dome, erected on a pediment pierced with graceful Saracenic arches.\nLight is admitted into the interior through a double screen of pierced marble, which tempers the glare of an Indian sky, while its whiteness prevents the mellow effect from degenerating into gloom. The internal decorations consist of inlaid work in precious stones, such as agate and jasper, with which every spandril or other salient point in the architecture is richly fretted. Brown and violet marble is also freely employed in wreaths, scrolls, and lintels, to relieve the monotony of the white walls. In regard to colour and design, the interior of the T\u00e1j may rank first in the world for purely decorative workmanship; while the perfect symmetry of its exterior, once seen, can never be forgotten, nor the aerial grace of its domes, rising like marble bubbles into the clear sky.\n\nThe T\u00e1j represents the most highly elaborated stage of ornamentation reached by the Indo-Muhammadan builders\u2014the stage at which the architect ends and the jeweller begins. In its magnificent gateway, the diagonal ornamentation at the corners which satisfied the designers of the gateways of the Ihtim\u00e1d-ud-Daul\u00e1 and Sikandra Mausoleums is superseded by fine marble cables, in bold twists, strong and handsome. The triangular insertions of white marble and large flowers have in like manner given place to fine inlaid work. Firm perpendicular lines in black marble, with well-proportioned panels of the same material, are effectively used in the interior of the gateway. On its top, the Hindu brackets and monolithic architraves of Sikandra are replaced by Moorish cusped arches, usually single blocks of red sandstone, in the kiosks and pavilions which adorn the roof. From the pillared pavilions a magnificent view is obtained of the T\u00e1j gardens below, with the noble Jumna river at their farther end, and the city and fort of Agra in the distance.\n\nFrom this beautiful and splendid gateway one passes up a straight alley, shaded by evergreen trees, and cooled by a broad shallow piece of water running along the middle of the path, to the T\u00e1j itself. The T\u00e1j is entirely of marble and gems. The red sandstone of the other Muhammadan buildings has disappeared: or rather the red sandstone, where used to form the thickness of the walls, is in the T\u00e1j overlaid completely with white marble; and the white marble is itself inlaid with precious stones arranged in lovely patterns of flowers. A feeling of purity impresses itself on the eye and the mind, from the absence of the coarser material which forms so invariable a material in Agra architecture. The lower walls and panels are covered with tulips, oleanders, and full-blown lilies, in flat carving on the white marble; and although the inlaid work of flowers, done in gems, is very brilliant when looked at closely, there is on the whole but little colour, and the all-prevailing sentiment is one of whiteness, silence, and calm. The whiteness is broken only by the fine colour of the inlaid gems, by lines in black marble, and by delicately written inscriptions, also in black, from the\nKuran. Under the dome of the vast mausoleum, a high and beautiful screen of open tracery in white marble rises round the two tombs, or rather cenotaphs, of the emperor and his princess; and in this marvel of marble, the carving has advanced from the old geometric patterns to a trellis-work of flowers and foliage, handled with great freedom and spirit. The two cenotaphs in the centre of the exquisite enclosure have no carving, except the plain Kalamd\u00e1n, or oblong pen-box, on the tomb of the Emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n. But both the cenotaphs are inlaid with flowers made of costly gems, and with the ever graceful oleander scroll.\n\nThe Tomb of Ihtim\u00e1d-ud-Daul\u00e1 rises on the left bank of the river. Ihtim\u00e1d-ud-Daul\u00e1 was the waz\u00edr, or prime minister, of the Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, and his mausoleum forms one of the treasures of Indian architecture. The great gateway is constructed of red sandstone, inlaid with white marble, and freely employing an ornamentation of diagonal lines, which produce a somewhat unrestful Byzantine effect. The mausoleum itself in the garden looks from the gateway like a structure of marble filagree. It consists of two stories: the lower one of marble, inlaid on the outside with coloured stones chiefly in geometrical patterns, diagonals, cubes, and stars. The numerous niches in the walls are decorated with enamelled paintings of vases and flowers. The principal entrance to the mausoleum is a marble arch, groined, and very finely carved with flowers in low relief. In the interior, painting or enamel is freely used for the roof and the dado of the walls; the latter are about $3\\frac{1}{2}$ feet high, of fine white marble inlaid with coloured stones in geometrical patterns. The upper storey consists of pillars of white marble (also inlaid with coloured stones), and of a series of perforated marble screens stretching from pillar to pillar. The whole forms a lovely example of marble open filagree work.\n\nAkbar\u2019s Tomb lies five miles from Agra, on the Muttra road, at Sikandra (q.v.).\n\nAmongst the modern buildings may be mentioned the Government College on the Drummond Road, the Central Prison, and the Judges\u2019 Courts. The Catholic Mission and Orphanage is also of interest for its relative antiquity, having been founded as early as the reign of Akbar, through the influence of the Jesuit fathers, when the Portuguese were the only Europeans who had much communication with India. In the cemetery are many tombs of early date with Armenian inscriptions.\n\nPopulation.\u2014By the Census of 1872, the total population of the city and station of Agra was returned at 149,008 souls, of whom 79,344 were males, and 69,664 females. In 1881, the total population was returned at 160,203, including the troops in cantonments, and the suburbs of T\u00e1jganj and Sh\u00e1hganj. Excluding the suburbs, the population consisted of 141,188 souls, of whom 77,368 were males and\n63,820 females. Hindus, 97,372; Muhammadans, 38,328; Jains, 1009; Christians, 4073; 'others,' 406. The city itself is remarkable for the comfort and solidity of its domestic architecture. The houses of the better classes are three or four storeys high; the upper floors being often decorated with carved balconies, and the lower floors are open, and surrounded by pillared verandahs.\n\nManufactures, Trade, etc.\u2014Agra is a great grain mart, whence traders to the south and west draw their supplies; and it is a centre where the sugar or other produce of Rohilkhand and the north converges, before being finally dispersed to the places of consumption. It has also a large manufacture of shoes, pipe stems, and gold lace. But to Europeans the main specialit\u00e9 of Agra is its inlaid mosaic work, like that of the T\u00e1j, which is still as beautifully and deftly fabricated as in the days of the Mughal Emperors. From the minuteness and delicacy of the work, it is necessarily very expensive. The chief imports of Agra are sugar, tobacco, grain, salt, and cotton, while the exports consist of darris or cotton carpets, gold lace, and wrought stone from the quarries of Fatehpur Sikri, and the Bandroli hills. The city has hardly maintained its commercial position of late years, as it lies away from the main line of the East Indian Railway. It is connected by a branch line from T\u00fandla (distant 13 miles), which crosses the Jumna by a bridge; while the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na State Railway from Bhartpur now affords access on the west, and the New Sindhia State Railway connects it with Dholpur and Gwalior on the south. When these lines are united with the Bombay system, their convergence at this point will doubtless render Agra once more the commercial metropolis of Northern India. In addition to these modern means of communication, the old imperial road through Muttra enters the town from the north-west, while the Fatehpur Sikri and Bhartpur roads communicate with the western country. The Jumna is also used for heavy traffic, though superseded by the railways for passengers and light goods.\n\nMunicipality.\u2014Agra has a municipality of 25 members, of whom 8 are official, and 17 elected by the taxpayers. In 1881-82 its gross income amounted to \u00a319,609, of which sum \u00a316,085 was raised by octroi; while its total expenditure was returned at \u00a319,114; incidence of taxation, 2s. 5\u00bdd. per head of the population (160,203) within municipal limits. [For further information regarding Agra City, see the authorities which I have quoted at the end of the last article (AGRA DISTRICT); also a useful little handbook to Agra, by H. G. Keene, C.S., Calcutta, 1878; and Fergusson's History of Indian Architecture (ed. 1876), a truly admirable work.]\n\nAgra Canal.\u2014An important irrigation work, available also for navigation, in Delhi, Gurg\u00e1on, Muttra, and Agra Districts, and Bhartpur State. The canal receives its supply from the Jumna river at Okla,\nabout 10 miles below Delhi. The weir across the Jumna was the first attempted in Upper India, on a river having a bed of the finest sand. The weir is about 800 yards long, and rises 7 feet above the summer level of the river. From Okla, the canal follows the high land between the Khari-nad\u00ed and the Jumna. Its course is fairly parallel with the Jumna throughout at a distance of from 3 to 12 miles from the river bank. The canal finally joins the Utangan river about 20 miles below Agra. Navigable branches connect the canal with Muttra and Agra, the latter of which has a lock into the Jumna, so that, as the main line is itself navigable, boats can pass by it from Delhi into the Jumna again at Agra city. The canal was finally opened in March 1874, and irrigation commenced from it in the following cold weather. It commands a total area of 375,800 acres as follows:\u2014Delhi District, 8600 acres; Gurg\u00e1o District, 92,300 acres; Muttra District, 114,200 acres; Agra District, 113,100 acres; and Bhartpur State, 47,600 acres. The length of the main and branch canals is 140 miles, with 313 miles of distributaries, making a total of 453 miles. The capital account of the canal up to the 31st March 1881, excluding interest, was \u00a3840,312. The Agra Canal is now a reproductive public work, and in 1880\u201381 yielded a profit over expenses of \u00a327,401, or 3\u00b740 per cent. The area actually irrigated in that year was 141,405 acres.\n\nAgra.\u2014Village in Khuln\u00e1 District, Bengal, about 1 mile N.E. of Kapilmuni, containing remains of old buildings, supposed to be the residences of early settlers in the Sundarbans.\n\nAgra Barkhera.\u2014Petty State or guaranteed Th\u00e1kurate under the Bhop\u00e1l Political Agency (Central India). Lat. 23\u00b0 57\u2032 N., long. 77\u00b0 32\u2032 E. The chief of the State holds the rank of Th\u00e1kur, with a grant of 12 villages from Sindhia, to whom he pays annually \u00a3588 as istamr\u00e1\u0301 dues or quit-rent. In 1857 the then chief Th\u00e1kur, Chattar S\u00e1l, joined the rebels, and his estate was confiscated; the villages held from Sindhia were, however, afterwards restored to the present chief, Th\u00e1kur Balwant Singh, who also receives from Karw\u00e1i \u00a330, and from Sindhia \u00a3237, yearly. Estimated revenue, \u00a3700; population (1881) about 4500.\n\nAgradwip.\u2014Island in the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed river, Nadiy\u00e1 District, Bengal; scene of one of the principal annual fairs and festivals of the District, held in April or May for a week, and attended by about 25,000 pilgrims. Lat. 25\u00b0 33\u2032 45\u2033 to 23\u00b0 37\u2032 N., long. 88\u00b0 17\u2032 15\u2033 to 88\u00b0 19\u2032 15\u2033 E.\n\nAgrah\u00e1ra Vall\u00e1lur.\u2014Town in the Coimbatore taluk, Coimbatore District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 10\u00b0 58\u2032 30\u2033 N., long. 77\u00b0 3\u2032 38\u2033 E. The population is mainly agricultural. Situated on the Noyil river, five miles south-east of Coimbatore, and near the Pathan\u00far Railway junction. The wet lands of the village are of high value.\n\nAgroha.\u2014Ancient town in Fateh\u00e1b\u00e1d tahsil, Hiss\u00e1r District, Punjab. Situated 13 miles north-west of Hiss\u00e1r. Original seat of the Agarw\u00e1la\nBaniy\u00e1s, and once a place of great importance. Remains of a fort still visible about half a mile from the existing village; ruins and d\u00e9bris half buried in the soil on every side, attest its former greatness. It has now lost all its former importance, and in 1881 contained a population of only 1156 souls. Captured by Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn Ghori in 1194, since which time the Agarw\u00e1la Baniy\u00e1s have been scattered over the whole peninsula. The clan comprises many of the wealthiest men in India.\n\n**Agror or Agrore (Ughi).**\u2014Frontier valley in the Mansahra tahsil of Haz\u00e1ra District, Punjab, comprising the upper basin of the river Kunhar. It consists of three branches of mountain glens, 10 miles in length and 6 in breadth. The lower portions form a mass of luxuriant cultivation, thickly dotted with villages, hamlets, and groves, and surrounded by dark pine-clad heights, whose depressions occasionally disclose the snowy peaks of the main range in the distance. These valleys are alike in their nature; they have no strictly level spaces, but consist rather of terraced flats which descend from the hills. Water is abundant and perennial, so that failure of crops seldom occurs. Lat. $34\u00b0 29'$ to $34\u00b0 35' 15''$ N., long. $72\u00b0 58'$ to $73\u00b0 9' 30''$ E. The population chiefly consists of Sw\u00e1tis and G\u00fajars, and was returned at 10,666 in 1881. Muhammadanism is the almost universal creed. Sole manufacture, common country cloth; trade purely local, except a small export of grain. The valley is under the direct management of the Kh\u00e1n of Agror; but the British Government maintains a th\u00e1n\u00e1 or police station under an inspector. Disturbances occurred in 1868, which resulted in the temporary removal of the Kh\u00e1n under surveillance to Lahore; but he has since been restored to his authority in the valley. Agror is exposed to raids from beyond the frontier, and a military force is maintained for the preservation of order. Area, 41,285 acres, of which 20,820 are cultivated.\n\n**Ag\u00famb\u00e9.**\u2014A pass in the Udipli taluk, South K\u00e1nara District, Madras Presidency, connecting Mysore with K\u00e1nara. Lat. $13\u00b0 29'$ to $13\u00b0 29' 30''$ N., long. $75\u00b0 6' 20''$ to $75\u00b0 8'$. The trunk road from Mangalore to the Nagar division of Mysore meets this pass, and much coffee and sandal-wood are conveyed through it to the coast, the pass being practicable for wheeled vehicles. The distance from the bottom to the top is about 5 miles, and the parallels are so arranged that the ascent is nowhere more than 1 in 18 feet.\n\n**Ag\u00fastisvaram.**\u2014Taluk in Travancore State, Madras Presidency. Area, 97 square miles; population (1881) 78,979.\n\n**Agwanpur-Mughalpur.**\u2014Town in Morad\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces. Population (1881) 5277, namely, Hindus, 2274; and Muhammadans, 3003; area of town site, 90 acres.\n\n**Agwon.**\u2014Revenue circle, Rangoon District, British Burma, N.E. of mouth of Rangoon river. Sandy, and fringed with belts of jungle and\nhigh grass, near the sea; open plains, slightly undulating towards the north, farther inland, with marshes well known for their fisheries. The population is chiefly engaged in agriculture, fisheries, and salt-making. Agwon has lately been divided into two revenue circles, North and South Agwon.\n\nAhams.\u2014A tribe of Sh\u00e1n descent inhabiting the Assam valley; and, prior to the invasion of the Burmese at the commencement of the present century, the dominant race in that country. The great Sh\u00e1n nation originally occupied a tract of country extending from Tipperah in the west to Yunan and Siam in the east, known as the kingdom of Pong, with its capital at the city now called Mogoung by the Burmese on the upper waters of the Irrawadi. The date of their first arrival in the Brahmaputra valley is variously given by different authorities. Colonel Dalton in his Ethnology of Bengal, following Robinson's History of Assam, states: 'In the reign of Sukampha, the thirteenth sovereign of the Empire of Pong (who succeeded his father A.D. 777), his brother Samlonpha, who was the general of his forces, having subjugated Cachar, Tipperah, and Manipur, pushed across the hills to the valley of the Brahmaputra, and commenced there a series of conquests by which the Sh\u00e1ns gradually reduced the whole country from Sadiy\u00e1 to K\u00e1mrup to subjection.' Robinson adds that Samlonpha, having effected a foothold in Assam, informed his brother of his successes, and announced his intended return. The Pong king, however, suspected his designs, and formed a conspiracy for poisoning Samlonpha, which, coming to the latter's knowledge, led to his remaining in Assam. From Samlonpha, the subsequent princes of the Aham dynasty are said to be descended. The Assam Census Report gives a different version, placing the advent of the Sh\u00e1ns nearly five centuries later. That Report states the proximate cause of their invasion of Assam to have been a dispute as to the accession to the throne of the Pong kingdom in 1228 A.D. Chukapha, one of the claimants, being set aside, left his native country with a scanty following, and marching north-westwards across the Patkoi range, entered Assam. He reached it by the valley of the N\u00e1mr\u00fap river, a tributary of the Buri Dihing. This legend probably records the last of a series of inroads from the Sh\u00e1n country. Chukapha, however, was the first ruler to assume the name of Aham, 'the peerless,' for himself and his people. He also gave the name, now altered to Asam or Assam, to the country. On the conversion of the Aham king Chatumla to Hinduism in 1654 A.D., a divine origin was discovered for his family by the Br\u00e1hman priests; and a long list of forty-eight names leads down from Indra, the king of the gods, to Chukapha, the first of the real Aham kings. Chatumla took the Hindu name of Jagadaya Singh; and since then, Hindu titles and names have been assumed by the Aham princes and their people.\nFor a century and a half from 1228, the successors of Chukapha appear to have ruled undisturbed over a small territory extending along the Dihing river. In 1376, they first came into contact with the Chuti\u00e1s, who then occupied the inhabited portions of Lakhimpur and Sibs\u00e1gar. After a struggle lasting 124 years, the Ahams finally overthrew the Chuti\u00e1 monarch in 1500, and made Garhgaon (q.v.) in Sibs\u00e1gar District their capital. From that time the Aham kings ruled over the country between Sadiy\u00e1 in Lakhimpur and Kali\u00e1bar in the north of Nowgong District. The extension of their power westward down the valley of the Brahmaputra was very gradual, and by no means uniformly successful. In 1563, their newly acquired territory in Sibs\u00e1gar was overrun, and their capital taken, by the Koch king, who, however, made no attempt to retain his conquests. In restoring their power, the Ahams entered into a struggle with the Cach\u00e1ris in Nowgong and Eastern Darrang, which ended in an alliance between them to defeat a threatened Muhammadan invasion in 1615. The Ahams soon afterwards extended their power to Gauh\u00e1ti. Half a century later, a second Muhammadan invasion under Mir Juml\u00e1, Aurangzeb\u2019s general, took place. But M\u00edr Juml\u00e1, after seizing the Aham capital, and imposing a tribute upon its ruler, was forced to retreat to Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 on the south bank of the Brahmaputra. The Aham kings now held sway over the entire Brahmaputra valley from Sadiy\u00e1 to near Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1, and from the skirts of the southern hills to the Bhuti\u00e1 frontier on the north. Their main strength, however, was on the borders of Sibs\u00e1gar and in Southern Lakhimpur, where the foundation of their power had originally been laid. The dynasty attained the height of its power under Rudra Singh, who is said to have ascended the throne in 1695.\n\nIn the following century, the Ahams began to decay, alike from internal dissensions and from the pressure of outside invaders. An insurrection of a religious sect known as Mo\u00e1m\u00e1riy\u00e1s compelled the removal of the Aham capital from Garhgaon to Rangpur, also in Sibs\u00e1gar. Continuous internecine dissensions again forced the removal of the capital farther to the west, till it was finally fixed at Gauh\u00e1ti in K\u00e1mr\u00fap. The Burmese were called in to the assistance of one of the contending factions in 1810. Having once obtained a foothold in the country, they established their power over the entire valley, and ruled with merciless barbarity until they were expelled by the British in 1824\u201325.\n\nThe Ahams retained the form of Government in Assam peculiar to the Sh\u00e1n tribes, and which may be briefly described as an organized system of personal service in lieu of taxation. (See article Assam.) In all other respects their national customs succumbed to Hinduism, and they are now completely Hinduized in religion, although distinguishable by their features from other Hindus. The Census Report\nstates that a special class of Ahams called Chasdang are found only in Sibs\u00e1gar District. 'The name is a term of office denoting the guards or executioners who lived within the precincts of the Court, sleeping underneath the platform upon which stood the bamboo palace of the king. These people still retain some of their old liberties; they drink strong liquor, eat swine's flesh and fowls, and bury their dead. But the national Sh\u00e1n deity, Chang or Song, whom Chutapha is said to have stolen and carried away with him from Mogoung, and to whose influence the success that attended his emigration is ascribed, has long been forgotten by all except a few of the Bailungs or astrologers, and the Deodhas or priestly class, who still retain at least a tradition of their old faith, and some written records of their own language.' The total number of Ahams in Assam in 1881 is returned in the Census Report at 179,283, of whom 117,872 were living in Sibs\u00e1gar, and 51,588 in Lakhimpur. [For further particulars regarding the Ahams, their system of administration, etc., see post, article Assam; Colonel Dalton's Descriptive Ethnology of Bengal, 1872; Robinson's Assam; Report on the Tribes of the North-Eastern Frontier of Bengal; the Bengal Census Report of 1872; and the Assam Census Report of 1881.]\n\nAhankaripur (Gosainganj).\u2014Town in Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Oudh, 22 miles from Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d town. Population (1881) 4280, of whom 2796 were Hindus and 1455 Muhammadans. Named after its founder, a Barw\u00e1r chief called Ahankari Rai. Considerable export trade in hides to Calcutta. Government school. An important railway station on the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway. A considerable market is springing up in the neighbourhood of the station.\n\nAh\u00e1r.\u2014Ancient ruined city in Udaipur Native State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, lying 3 miles east of Udaipur town. It is said to have been founded by As\u00e1ditya upon the site of the still more ancient capital, Tamba Nagari, where dwelt the Tuar ancestors of Vikram\u00e1ditya before he obtained Awinti or Ujjain; from Tamba Nagari its name was changed to Anandpur, and at length to Ah\u00e1r, which gave the patronymic of Ah\u00e1ria to the Gehlot race. Vestiges of immense mounds still remain to the eastward called the Dhulkot (or fort destroyed by the ashes of a volcanic eruption), in which sculpture, pottery, and coins are found. Some very ancient Jain temples are still to be traced, erected apparently from the ruins of shrines still older; and the ground is strewed with the wrecks of monuments and old temples whose stones have been used in erecting the cenotaphs of the R\u00e1n\u00e1s.\n\nAh\u00e1r.\u2014Ancient town in Bulandshahr District, North-Western Provinces; lying on the right bank of the Ganges, 21 miles N.E. of Bulandshahr. Population (1881) 2736. Police station, post-office, school. Large fair in June, at which crowds assemble to bathe in the Ganges. The town abounds in temples, which are, however, of no great\nantiquity nor of any architectural interest. There is a small red sandstone mosque, apparently of the time of Akbar. The town possesses no local trade, and it is now in a very decayed condition. A bridge of boats crosses the Ganges at this place in the dry months. Large tumuli in the neighbourhood testify to its former importance; probably the capital of a Hindu principality before the advent of the Musalm\u00e1ns. The Nagar Br\u00e1hmans of Ah\u00e1r became Muhammadans under Aurangzeb, and retained their proprietary rights till 1857, when they forfeited their lands by complicity in the Mutiny. Their property was then conferred on R\u00e1j\u00e1 Gursahai Mall of Morad\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\nAhiri.\u2014Zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri, constituting the southern portion of Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 District, Central Provinces. Lat. $18\u00b0\\ 57'30''$ to $20\u00b0\\ 52'30''$ N., long. $79\u00b0\\ 57'$ to $81\u00b0\\ 1'E.$; area, 2672 square miles; villages, 309; occupied houses, 4702; population (1881) 25,896, namely 13,379 males and 12,517 females. Hilly on the east and south, and famed for its magnificent forests. Much of the teak has been felled, but many thousand fine trees still remain. Inhabitants almost entirely Gonds; languages, Gond\u00ed and Tel\u00fagu. The proprietor is first in rank of the Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs, and is connected with the family of the Gond kings.\n\nAhiri.\u2014Forest in the chiefship of the same name, yielding teak of great value; two blocks named Bemaram and Mirkall\u00fa have been reserved by Government and marked out by boundary lines. Lat. $19\u00b0\\ 18'30''$ to $19\u00b0\\ 27'45''$ N., long. $80\u00b0\\ 7'$ to $80\u00b0\\ 13'15''$ E.\n\nAh\u00edrw\u00e1s.\u2014A ruined fort in Holkar's dominions, in Central India. Lat. $22\u00b0\\ 31'N.$, long. $76\u00b0\\ 31'E.$ Situated in the pargan\u00e1 of Satw\u00e1s, and distant from B\u00e1gli 14 miles. Celebrated as the last refuge of the Pind\u00e1ri leader, Chitu, who was eventually killed by a tiger in the surrounding jungle.\n\nAh\u00edy\u00e1ri.\u2014Village in Darbhanga District, Bengal. Lat. $26\u00b0\\ 18'N.$, long. $85\u00b0\\ 50'45\"E.$ Population (1881) 2162. Scene of religious gathering, called Ahaly\u00e1sth\u00e1n, attended by 10,000 people; contains a fine temple with images of R\u00e1m\u00e1 and S\u00edt\u00e1.\n\nAhmad\u00e1b\u00e1d (Ahmedabad).\u2014A District in the Province of Gujar\u00e1t (Guz\u00e9r\u00e1t), Northern Division, Bombay Presidency, lying between $21\u00b0\\ 57'30''$ and $23\u00b0\\ 24'30''$ N. latitude, and $71\u00b0\\ 20'$ and $72\u00b0\\ 57'30''$ E. longitude. Total area, 3821 square miles, with 9 towns and 853 villages. Population (1881) 856,324. The chief town and administrative headquarters of the District are at Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d city.\n\nAhmad\u00e1b\u00e1d District is bounded on the west and south by the peninsula of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, on the north by the northern division of the Baroda territory, on the north-east by the M\u00e1h\u00ed K\u00e1ntha territory, on the east by the State of B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor and the British District of Kaira, and on the south-east by the State and Gulf of Cambay. The boundary line is irregular, and two of the Sub-divisions\u2014Par\u00e1ntij in the north-\neast, and Ghoga (Gogo) in the south\u2014are cut off from the main body of the District by the territories of native chiefs. The compactness of the District is also broken by several villages belonging to Baroda and K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r lying within it, while several of its own are scattered in small groups beyond its own borders.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The general appearance of the District shows that at no very remote period it has been covered by the sea. The tract between the head of the Gulf of Cambay and the Rann of Kachh (Cutch) is still subject to overflow in high tides. In the extreme south, and also just beyond the northern boundary, are a few rocky hills. But between these points the whole of the District forms a level plain, gradually rising towards the north and east, its surface unbroken by any inequality greater than a sand-hill.\n\nThe chief feature of the District is the river S\u00e1barmati, which rises in the north-east, near the extremity of the Ar\u00e1valli range, and flows towards the south-west, falling finally into the Gulf of Cambay. Its total course is about 200 miles, estimated velocity in September 2 to 4 feet, with a discharge of from 1500 to 90,000 cubic feet per second, and the drainage area about 9500 square miles. The river has several tributaries both above and below Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d city, of which some are of considerable size. The S\u00e1barmati is not navigable. In all parts of the District, except in the west, where the water is so salt as to be unfit even for the purposes of cultivation, wells exist in abundance, and in most places good water is found at a depth of about 25 feet. The District is also well supplied with reservoirs and tanks for storing water, not only near towns and villages, but in outlying parts; these cover an area of some 14,000 acres. Though in favourable years a sufficient supply of water is thus maintained, after a season of deficient rainfall, many of the tanks dry up, causing much hardship and loss of cattle. The only large lake in the District is situated in the south of the Viramg\u00e1m Sub-division, about 37 miles south-west of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d. This sheet of water, called the Nal, is estimated to cover an area of 49 square miles. Its water, at all times brackish, grows more saline as the dry season advances, till at the close of the hot weather it has become nearly salt. The borders of the lake are fringed with reeds and other rank vegetation, affording cover to innumerable wild-fowl of every description. In the bed of the lake are many small islands, much used as grazing grounds for cattle during the hot season. In the north of the District, near the town of Par\u00e1ntij, in a hollow called the Bokh (lit. a fissure or chasm), are two smaller lakes. Of these, the larger covers an area of about 160 acres, with a depth of 30 feet of sweet water; and the smaller, with an area of 31 acres, is 8 feet deep in the rains and cold season, but occasionally dries up before the close of the hot weather.\nGeologically, Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d District is an alluvial plain, bounded on the south by a range of hills, about 700 feet in height; and in the north-east, by sandstone rocks close to the surface.\n\nWith the exception of a quarry in the Viramg\u00e1m Sub-division, from which small slabs of stone are obtained for building purposes, Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d is without minerals. There are no forests in the District, but the common trees of Gujar\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t) are found near villages and in the fields. The domestic animals are cows, buffaloes, oxen, camels, horses, asses, sheep, and goats. The breed of cattle is held in esteem. Government stud stallions are stationed in the District, and the efforts to improve the local breed, by the introduction of Arab sires, have been fairly successful. Tigers are found in the jungles in the north-east. The smaller kinds of game are obtained during the cold season in great numbers, especially quail, duck, and snipe. Fish abound.\n\nHistory.\u2014Although Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d District contains settlements of very high antiquity, its lands are said to have been first brought under tillage by the Anhilw\u00e1r\u00e1 kings (746\u20131297 A.D.). Notwithstanding their wealth and power, large portions remained in the hands of half independent Bh\u00edl chiefs, who eventually tendered their allegiance to the Emperor Akbar (1572). Except Gogo, all of its present lands were included in the district sark\u00e1r of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, some outlying portions being held in the position of tributary chiefdoms. In the middle of the 18th century (1753), after the capture of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, the Peshw\u00e1 and the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r found it convenient to continue this distinction between the central and outlying parts. A regular system of management was introduced into the central portion, while the outlying chiefs were only called on to pay a yearly tribute, and so long as they remained friendly, were left undisturbed. Until their transfer to the British, in 1803, the position of the border chieftains remained unchanged, except that their tribute was gradually raised. The first English acquisition in the District was due to the aggression of the Bh\u00e1unagar chief, who, intriguing to obtain a footing in Dholera, drove the people to seek British protection. The Bombay Government was implored for years to take possession of Dholera and to protect its inhabitants from their neighbour's aggressions. In 1802, the offer was accepted, the cession being sanctioned by the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r, then the Peshw\u00e1's Deputy. Sir Miguel de Souza was sent to examine and report upon this new possession, and he was of opinion that the cession would be of little value without the addition of other adjoining estates. These were also ceded, and in the following year, 1803, Dholka was handed over to the British for the support of a subsidiary force. In 1817, in order to provide for the regular payment of additional troops, the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r granted to the English, in perpetual gift, his own as well as the Peshw\u00e1's share in the city of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, and in other portions of the District. The territory\nacquired in 1802-3 remained under the Resident at Baroda till 1805, when it was included in the charge of the newly appointed Collector of Kaira. On the 1st of January 1818, in consequence of fresh cessions of territory, Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d was made a separate District. In 1886-87, this District will become open to resettlement, the first settlement having taken place in 1856-57.\n\n**Population.**\u2014In 1857, the population numbered 650,223, and 829,637 in 1872. The Census of 1881 returned a total population of 856,324, or 224 persons to the square mile. Of these, 729,493, or 85\u00b718 per cent., are Hindus; 83,942, or 9\u00b780 per cent., Musalm\u00e1ns; 652, or 0\u00b708 per cent., P\u00e1rs\u00eds; 1528, or 0\u00b718 per cent., Christians; 38,470, or 4\u00b749 per cent., Jains; 233 Jews; and 1996 aborigines. Males 439,394, females 416,930; dwelling in 199,996 houses; number of houses per square mile, 87\u00b74; persons per occupied house, 4\u00b728. Proportion of males to the total population, 51\u00b731. Among the Hindus the males number 375,879, the females 353,614; and Musalm\u00e1n males 42,086, females 41,856.\n\nAmong the Hindus, the merchant or *baniy\u00e1* class is the most influential; but, contrary to the rule in other parts of Guzer\u00e1t, the Sar\u00e1wak *baniy\u00e1s*, or Jain merchants, are superior to the Meshri *baniy\u00e1s* or Br\u00e1hmanical traders, in wealth. The wealthiest members of both classes employ their capital locally, supplying the funds by which the village usurers and dealers carry on their business. Those who do not possess sufficient capital to subsist solely by money-lending, borrow at moderate rates of interest from their caste-fellows of greater wealth, and deal in cloth, grain, timber, or sugar. The poorest of all keep small retail shops, or move from place to place hawking articles required by the rural population for their daily consumption. Besides engaging in trade, both the Sar\u00e1waks and Meshri *baniy\u00e1s* are employed as clerks, either in Government or private offices.\n\nAlthough Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d is one of the first manufacturing Districts of the Bombay Presidency, the large majority of the people support themselves by agriculture. Among the Hindus, the chief cultivating classes are the Kunb\u00eds, R\u00e1jputs, and Kol\u00eds. There is also in most parts of the District a sprinkling of Musalm\u00e1n cultivators or Bor\u00e1s, as well as Musalm\u00e1ns of the common type. The Kunb\u00eds, who number 109,690, or 12\u00b78 per cent. of the total population, are an important class. Many of them are skilled weavers and artisans, and some have risen to high positions in Government service, or have acquired wealth in trade; but the majority are engaged in agriculture and form the bulk of the peasant proprietors in Guzer\u00e1t. There is no real difference of caste between Kunb\u00eds and Pattid\u00e1rs, though Pattid\u00e1rs will not now intermarry with ordinary Kunb\u00eds. Both classes are excellent cultivators. Immorality is uncommon among them, and crime rare. They are also more intelligent\nand better educated than the rest of the agricultural population. The Kunb\u00eds are divided into three classes\u2014Lew\u00e1s, Kad\u00e1v\u00e1s, and Anj\u00e1n\u00e1s. Female infanticide, owing to the ruinous expenses attached to marriage, having been found prevalent among the Kunb\u00eds, the provisions of Act viii. of 1870 were applied to the Kad\u00e1v\u00e1 and Lew\u00e1 Kunb\u00eds. Two of the marriage customs of the Kad\u00e1v\u00e1 Kunb\u00eds are deserving of notice:\u2014\n\n(1) When a suitable match cannot be found, a girl is sometimes formally married to a bunch of flowers, which is afterwards thrown into a well. The girl is then considered a widow, and can now be married by the n\u00e1tr\u00e1 (second marriage) form\u2014a cheap process. (2) At other times they marry a daughter to a man already married, previously obtaining his promise to divorce her as soon as the ceremony is completed. The girl is afterwards given in n\u00e1tr\u00e1 to any one who may wish to marry her.\n\nNext in position to the Kunb\u00eds are the R\u00e1jputs, who still retain to some extent the look and feelings of soldiers. They are divided into two classes:\u2014(1) Gar\u00e1si\u00e1s, or landowners; and (2) Cultivators. The former live a life of idleness on the rent of their lands, and are greatly given to the use of opium. There is nothing in the dress or habits of a cultivating R\u00e1jput to distinguish him from a Kunb\u00ed, though, as farmers, they are far inferior in skill and less industrious. Their women, unlike those of the Gar\u00e1si\u00e1s, are not confined to the house, but help their husbands in the labour of the field. The character of the Kol\u00eds, as agriculturists, varies much in different parts of the District. In the more central villages, their fields can hardly be distinguished from those cultivated by Kunb\u00eds, while towards the frontier they are little superior to other aboriginal tribes. Crimes of violence are occasionally committed among them; but, as a class, they have settled down in the position of peaceful husbandmen,\u2014a marked contrast to their lawless practices fifty years ago.\n\nClassified according to caste, the chief among the Hindus were 43,000 Br\u00e1hmans, 48,653 R\u00e1jputs, 15,377 Cham\u00e1rs, 7188 Shimpis (tailors), 11,621 barbers, 109,690 Kunb\u00eds, 176,268 Kol\u00eds, 20,555 Kumbh\u00e1rs (potters), 11,659 Loh\u00e1rs, 40,626 Mah\u00e1rs, and 10,758 Sut\u00e1rs (carpenters). Of the 83,942 Musalm\u00e1ns, 77,326 are Sunnis and 6616 Shi\u00e1s. Of the 1528 Christians, 559 are Europeans, 53 Eurasians, and 916 are native converts.\n\nThe language chiefly spoken is Guzer\u00e1thi, but in the towns Hindust\u00e1ni is generally understood.\n\nThere were in 1881, 862 inhabited State and alienated villages, giving an average of 0\u00b722 to each square mile, and 993\u00b74 inhabitants to each village. The total number of houses in 1881 was 199,996 occupied and 134,089 unoccupied, or an average of 87\u00b74 to each square mile, and about 4 persons per house.\n\nThe chief towns of the District are\u2014(1) Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, population,\ncity 124,767, cantonment 2854; (2) Dholka, population 17,716; (3) Viramgam, population 18,990; (4) Dholera, population 10,301; (5) Dhandhuka, population 10,044; (6) Gogo (Gogha), population 7063; (7) Parantij, population 8353; (8) Morasa, population 7031; and (9) Sanand, population 6984.\n\nManufactures.\u2014Ahmadabad holds an important place as a manufacturing District. Except the preparation of salt, carried on near the Rann, most of its manufactures are, however, centred in the city of Ahmadabad. At Khargor\u00e1, about 56 miles north-west of Ahmadabad, are situated the salt works, from which salt is distributed through Guzer\u00e1t. A railway has been carried into the heart of the works, and a large store has been built at Khargor\u00e1. Minor dep\u00f4ts have been constructed at Ahmadabad, Broach, and Surat. Other stations on the railway are supplied by a contractor. Salt is sold at all dep\u00f4ts and railway stations at one uniform price of Rs. 3. 7. (6s. 10d.) per 80 lbs. The salt is made not from sea water, but from brine, found at a depth of from 18 to 30 feet below the surface. This brine is much more concentrated than sea water, and contains in proportion about six times as much salt. Saltpetre is largely manufactured in the neighbourhood of the salt-works. The other manufactures are silk, gold and silver work, hardware, copper and brassware, pottery, woodwork, cotton cloth, shoes, blankets, soap, and paper. In 1881, there were four steam cotton mills, working 57,928 spindles and 684 looms.\n\nIn consequence of the importance of its manufactures of silk and cotton cloth, the system of caste or trade unions is more fully developed in Ahmadabad than in any other part of Guzer\u00e1t. Each of the different castes of traders, manufacturers, and artisans, forms its own trade guild. All heads of households belong to the guild. Every member has a right to vote, and decisions are passed by a majority of votes. In cases where one industry has many distinct branches, there are several guilds. Thus among potters, the makers of bricks, of tiles, and of earthen jars, are for trade purposes distinct; and in the great weaving trade, those who prepare the different articles of silk and cotton form distinct associations. The objects of the trade guild are, to regulate competition among the members, and to uphold the interest of the body in any dispute arising with other craftsmen. For example, in 1872, the cloth dealers agreed among themselves, that they would reduce the rates formerly paid by them to the sizers or t\u00e1g\u00e1s; the sizers on their side refused to prepare cloth at the reduced rates. The dispute lasted for about six weeks, and during that time the sizers remained out of work. The matter in dispute was at last settled, and a formal agreement by both parties was drawn up on stamped paper. Again, to modify the competition of the members of a craft, the guild appoints certain days as trade holidays, when any\nmember who works is punished by fine. This arrangement is found in almost all guilds. A special case occurred in 1873 among the Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d bricklayers. Men of this class in some cases added 3d. to their daily wages by working extra time in the morning. But several families were thrown out of employment; accordingly the guild met, and decided that as there was not employment for all, no man should be allowed to work extra time. The decisions of the guilds are enforced by fines. If the defender refuses to pay, and the members of the guild all belong to one caste, the offender is put out of caste. If the guild contains men of different castes, the guild uses its influence with other guilds, to prevent the recusant member from getting work. Besides the amount received from fines, the different guilds draw an income by levying fees on any person beginning to practise his craft. This custom prevails in the cloth and other industries. But no fee is paid by potters, carpenters, and other inferior artisans. An exception is also made in the case of a son succeeding his father, when nothing has to be paid. In other cases the amount varies, in proportion to the importance of the trade, from \u00a35 to \u00a350. The revenue derived from these fees, and from fines, is expended in feasts to the members of the guild, and in charity. Charitable institutions or sad\u00e1varat, where beggars are daily fed, are maintained in Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d at the expense of the trade guilds.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Exclusive of lands belonging to other territory situated within its limits, Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d District contains a total area of 2,445,440 acres, of which 607,822 acres are arable assessed Government land, and 731,458 acres t\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri, or a total of 1,339,280 acres, of which 1,248,216 acres were returned as cultivated in 1881\u201382. Of the cultivated area, 9637 acres or 0\u00b78 per cent. were garden lands; 1,164,536 acres or 94\u00b73 per cent. were dry crop lands; and 60,578 or 5 per cent. were rice lands. Of the total area, 248,635 acres or 10\u00b721 per cent. have been alienated by the State; and 1,400,416 acres or 57\u00bd per cent. are either t\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri, i.e. held by large landowners, or mehw\u00e1si, i.e. held by chiefs of the classes who pay a tribute instead of a regular assessment.\n\nThe two principal varieties of soil are the black and the white. In many parts of the District, both kinds occur within the limits of the same village; but on the whole, the black soil is found chiefly towards the west, and the light-coloured soil in the east. With the help of water and manure, the light-coloured soil is very fertile; and though during the dry weather, especially where subject to traffic, it wears into a loose fine sand, yet after rain has fallen, it again becomes tolerably compact and hard. Two other varieties of soil are less generally distributed; an alluvial deposit of the S\u00e1barmati river, the most fertile soil in the District, easily irrigated, and holding water at the depth of\na few feet below the surface; and in the north-east of the District, a red stony soil, like that of Belg\u00e1um in the south of the Presidency.\n\nAs compared with the other British Districts of Guzer\u00e1t, an important peculiarity of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d is the great extent of land held by the class of large landholders called t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs, who own the lands of 387 villages, or 46\u00b747 per cent. of the whole number in the District. Their possessions comprise the border land between Guzer\u00e1t Proper and the peninsula of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. Historically, this tract forms \u2018the coast, where the d\u00e9bris of the old R\u00e1jput Principalities of that peninsula was worn and beaten by the successive waves of Musalm\u00e1n and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 invasion.\u2019 But these estates are part of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r rather than of Guzer\u00e1t. Their proprietors are K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r chiefs, and their communities have the same character as the smaller States of the western peninsula. The t\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri villages are held by both Hindus and Musalm\u00e1ns. Among the Hindus are the representatives of several distinct classes. The Chud\u00e1sam\u00e1s are descended from the Hindu dynasty of Jun\u00e1garh in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, subverted by the Musalm\u00e1n kings of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, at the end of the 15th century; the W\u00e1ghel\u00e1s are a remnant of the Solanki race, who fled from Anhilw\u00e1r\u00e1 when that kingdom was destroyed by Al\u00e1-\u00fad-d\u00edn in 1297 A.D.; the Gohels emigrated from M\u00e1rw\u00e1r many centuries ago; the Jh\u00e1l\u00e1s, akin to the W\u00e1ghel\u00e1s, were first known as Makw\u00e1r\u00e1s; the Th\u00e1k\u00e1r\u00e1s are the offspring of Solanki and Makw\u00e1na families, who lost position by intermarriage with the Kol\u00eds of M\u00e1hi K\u00e1ntha. The Musalm\u00e1n families are for the most part relics of the old Muhammadan nobles of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d. Besides these, there are a few estates still held by descendants of favourites of the Mughal or Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rulers; by Molesal\u00e1ms, converted R\u00e1jputs of the Parm\u00e1r tribe, who came from Sind about A.D. 1450; and by Musalm\u00e1n officers from Delhi, in the service of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. All Parm\u00e1rs and Musalm\u00e1ns are called Kasb\u00e1t\u00eds, or men of the Kasb\u00e1 or chief town, as opposed to the rural chiefs. There are also other Kasb\u00e1t\u00eds, who say that they came from Khor\u00e1s\u00e1n to Patan, and received a gift of villages from the W\u00e1ghel\u00e1 kings.\n\nLandowners of this class are subject to the payment of a fixed quitrent to Government. In other respects they are considered absolute proprietors. In the course of time, the estates have become so subdivided, that in most villages there are several shareholders, mutually responsible for the payment to Government of the whole quit-rent. One of their number is generally appointed manager, and entrusted with the duties of collecting their shares from the different members. The first settlement of the District took place in 1856\u201357, and the next will take place thirty years after, in 1886\u201387. Under the shareholders are tenants, by whom the work of actual cultivation is carried on, and who receive from the landlord a share in the crops, varying from 40 to\n50 per cent. In the year 1862 it was found necessary to adopt special measures for the relief of many of the talukdars, who were sunk in debt; 469 estates were taken under the management of Government, and a survey was undertaken and completed in 1865-66, with the view of ascertaining precisely the area and resources of the different villages. The claims brought against the landlords were then enquired into, and the total amount awarded to the creditors fixed at \u00a3136,040. Of this sum \u00a3128,963, or 94.79 per cent. of the whole, had, up to the end of 1876, been repaid, and of the \u00a355,000 advanced by Government, only \u00a313,647 were outstanding.\n\nAs in other parts of Guzerat, there are in Ahmadabad two sets of agricultural operations\u2014one ending in the early or kharif, lasting from July to November; and the other in the late or rab\u00ed harvest, from November to March. The cultivating season is generally considered to begin immediately after the first fall of rain in June or July. A month or two before this, however, manure is carted to the field, and left there exposed to the action of the sun; and after a fall of rain, the manure is spread over the ground and ploughed in. The plough used is of the most simple construction, costing from 6s. to 8s. After two ploughings, each to the depth of 4 or 5 inches, the ground is considered ready for the seed, which is sown by a drill plough. Several English ploughs have been distributed in the District, and they are appreciated by the cultivators, as the land is found to derive lasting benefit from deeper ploughing. The advantages of a free use of manure are admitted by the husbandmen; but, at the same time, as a great part of the cowdung is burnt as fuel, the ground is but scantily manured. The District is not favourable for direct river irrigation, as most of the rivers flow in deep, narrow channels with sandy beds. At the same time, there are many spots along the course of the S\u00e1barmati, Kh\u00e1ri, and Bh\u00e1dhar rivers, where, by means of a frame on the banks, water is raised in leather bags. Well water is also used to a considerable extent. The irrigation from tanks and reservoirs is almost confined to the early part of the cold season, when water is required to bring the rice crops to maturity. The Government irrigation works in the north-eastern Sub-division of the District, constructed at a cost of \u00a328,000, are designed to irrigate once in three years' rotation 30,000 acres.\n\nThe agricultural stock in the possession of the cultivators during 1881-82 was returned at 64,303 ploughs; 21,247 carts; 151,539 bullocks; 123,280 buffaloes; 85,926 cows; 7203 horses; and 72,077 sheep and goats. Of the total of 1,248,216 acres under actual cultivation in the same year, cereals occupied 602,761 acres, or 48.3 per cent.; pulses, 72,305 acres, or 5.8 per cent.; oil-seeds, 23,000 acres, or 1.8 per cent.; fibres, 162,812 acres, or 13.0 per cent.; tobacco, 1293 acres;\nsugar-cane, 2769 acres; indigo, 200 acres; other dyes, 495 acres; and miscellaneous crops, 4166 acres. In addition, 391,245 acres were fallow or under grass.\n\n**Natural Calamities.**\u2014During the past two centuries and a half, fourteen years have been memorable for natural calamities. Of these, three were in the 17th, six in the 18th, and seven in the 19th centuries. In the 17th century, the year 1629 is said to have been a season of great famine; and 1650 and 1686 were years of drought and scarcity. In the 18th century, 1718 and 1747 were years of scarcity, and 1771 was one of pestilence. The years 1714 and 1739 were marked by disastrous floods in the S\u00e1barmati. In 1755, extraordinarily heavy rains did considerable damage to the city of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d. The famine, which reached its height in 1790\u201391, and from having occurred in Samvat 1847, is known by the name *satt\u00e1lo*, lasted through several seasons. In the 19th century, the years 1812\u201313 were marked by the ravages of locusts; 1819\u201320 and 1824\u201325 were years of insufficient rainfall. In 1834, the rainfall was again short, and the distress was increased by vast swarms of locusts. In 1838, there was a failure of the usual supply of rain. In 1868, another disastrous flood of the S\u00e1barmati occurred. In September 1875, the city of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d and three eastern Sub-divisions were visited by extraordinary floods of the S\u00e1barmati river. Two iron bridges and a large portion of the town were washed away; and throughout the District 101 villages suffered very severely. In years of famine and scarcity, immigration from M\u00e1hr\u00e1 and other places is said to have added to the local distress.\n\n**Roads, Trade, etc.**\u2014Before the introduction of railways, the main route of the trade of Central India and M\u00e1lwa passed through Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d District. The general means of transit included carts drawn by two or more pairs of bullocks, camels, and pack bullocks. Thirty years ago there were no made roads in the District; and during heavy rain the country became impassable to carts, and traffic was suspended. At present the means of communication are three\u2014by road, by rail, and by sea. Within the last few years, many good roads have been constructed; and for internal communication, the common Guzer\u00e1t cart, drawn by two, and sometimes four bullocks, is still in use. In 1880\u201381, there were 85 miles of metalled road, and 309 miles of road suitable for fair weather traffic only. The Bombay Baroda and Central India Railway runs through the District for a distance of 93 miles, the R\u00e1jput-\u00e1na State Railway for a distance of 15\u00be miles, and the Dhol\u00e1-Wadhwan branch of the Bh\u00e1unagar-Gondal Railway for a distance of about 20 miles. The seaports of the District are Dholera and Gogo; towns at one time of importance, but whose trade has of late years been falling off. The imports comprise sugar, piece goods, timber, metal, grain, cocoa-nuts, and molasses; the exports are cotton, seeds, and grain.\nThe trade of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d is almost entirely carried on by local capital. The great distance from Bombay is said to have given a distinctive character to its merchants, as compared with those of Southern Guzer\u00e1t. They are more conservative, and less extravagant. Bankers make advances to each other on personal security for short periods at from 2 to 6 per cent. per annum. In all transactions, when an article worth more than the amount advanced is given in pledge, the rate of interest in the city is reported to be so low as from 3 to 4 per cent. per annum, without any reference to the circumstances of the borrower.\n\nThe wages in 1881\u201382 of skilled labourers, such as masons, carpenters, and bricklayers, were 1s. 3\u00bdd. a day; those of able-bodied agricultural labourers, 5d. a day; the hire for carts and camels, 3s. a day. The current prices of the chief articles of food during 1881\u201382 were\u2014for wheat, 5s. 3\u00bdd. per maund of 80 lbs.; for barley, 2s. 1\u00bdd.; for rice, from 8s. 6d. to 10s. 9d.; for millet or bajra, 4s. 1\u00bdd.; for Indian millet or joar, 3s. 6d.; for split peas or dal, 5s. 1\u00bdd.; for gram, 3s. 1\u00bdd.; for flour, 6s. 8\u00bdd.; for clarified butter or ghee, \u00a33, 5s. od.; and for salt, 5s. 9\u00bdd.\n\nAdministration.\u2014For administrative purposes, Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d is divided into seven t\u00e1luks or Sub-divisions, viz. Daskroi, Samand, Viramgam, Dholka, Dhandhuka, Parantij-Morasa, and Gogo. Of these, six are generally entrusted to covenanted assistants, and one is under the Collector\u2019s personal control. The supervision of the District treasury is in the hands of an uncovenanted assistant, styled a Deputy Collector. These officers have, under the supervision of the Collector, the chief management of the different administrative bodies, local funds, and municipal committees within the limits of their revenue charges. The revenue charge of each fiscal Sub-division is placed in the hands of a native officer, styled m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r, who is entrusted with magisterial powers. For the settlement of civil disputes, there are seven courts. Thirty-two officers, including eight Europeans, share the administration of criminal justice. In the year 1881 the total strength of the District or regular police force was 1200 officers and men; the cost of maintenance was \u00a321,191. These figures show an average of one man to every three square miles as compared with the area, and one man to every 691 souls as compared with the population. The cost of maintenance is equal to \u00a35, 10s. od. per square mile, or 6d. per head of population. In 1881, the Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d jail contained a daily average of 479 convicted prisoners, including 45 females, showing one prisoner to every 1788 of the population. The total expenditure was \u00a32,312, 18s., or \u00a34, 16s. 7d. per head. The District contains 19 post-offices and 12 telegraph offices.\n\nIn 1881\u201382 the whole amount of revenue raised, including imperial, municipal, and local funds, was \u00a3358,285, showing an incidence of 8s. 4d. per head of population. The land tax alone produced\n\u00a3143,974. The District local funds created since 1863 for works of public utility and rural education, realized in 1880-81 a total revenue of \u00a311,647, against an expenditure of \u00a39282. There are seven municipalities in the District; of these 1 is a city corporation and 6 are town corporations, namely:\u2014Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d city, population, 124,767; Dholka, 17,716; Viramg\u00e1m, 18,990; Dhandh\u00faka, 10,044; Gogo, 7063; Par\u00e1nt\u00edj, 8353; and Mor\u00e1s\u00e1, 7031. The total municipal receipts in 1881-82 amounted to \u00a332,553; and the total expenditure to \u00a348,852. The incidence of municipal taxation, per head of population, was 3s. 6d., and of income 2s. 9d. There are eleven dispensaries and two hospitals. During 1881-82, 98,647 patients were treated, of whom 95,418 were out-door, and 3229 in-door patients. There is a lunatic asylum at Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d city, where, in 1881, 141 persons were treated. In the same year 25,311 persons were vaccinated. The total number of deaths reported in the fourteen years ending 1879 was 261,122, or an average yearly mortality of 18,652, or 22\u00b748 per 1000. In 1881 the registered deaths were, males, 13,757; females, 12,040: total, 25,777, showing a ratio of 30\u00b799 per 1000.\n\nIn the year 1880-81 there were 193 Government schools, or an average of about one school for every five villages. Of the whole number, 13 were girls\u2019 schools. The average daily attendance at these schools was 6792 pupils, or 2\u00b755 per cent. of 265,970, the population between six and twenty years of age. The receipts for educational purposes were \u00a38980, and the expenditure \u00a36650. Of the total expenditure on education, \u00a31419 was defrayed by imperial, and \u00a34284 by local and other funds. In 1881-82, the Government schools numbered 200. There are 11 printing presses in the District, publishing 3 newspapers and 6 periodicals.\n\nExcept in the southern tracts lying along the sea-coast, the District, especially towards the north and east, is subject to considerable variations of temperature. Between the months of November and February, periods of severe cold occur, lasting generally from two days to a week. During the hot months, from February to June, the heat is severe; and as the rainfall is light, the climate in the rainy season is hot and close. October is the most sickly month. The average annual rainfall between 1852 and 1861 was 37\u00b735 inches; between 1862 and 1871, 22\u00b789 inches; and in 1875, 27\u00b751 inches were registered. The mean temperature, on an average of the last ten years ending 1880, is 82\u00b73\u00b0 F., the maximum within doors being 110\u00b0, and the minimum 52\u00b0.\n\n[For further information regarding Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d District, see the Bombay Gazetteer, vol. iv. 1879: an admirable volume edited by Mr. James Campbell, C.S., from information chiefly supplied by Mr. F.

Lely, C.S., and Mr. Beyts, and published by the Bombay Government.]\n\nAhmad\u00e1b\u00e1d (Ahmed\u00e1b\u00e1d) City.\u2014The chief city in the District\nof the same name, Bombay Presidency, 310 miles north from Bombay, and about 50 miles north of the head of the Gulf of Cambay. Lat. $23^\\circ 1' 45''$ N., long. $72^\\circ 38' 30''$ E. Population (1881) 127,621, including 2854 in cantonments.\n\nAhmad\u00e1b\u00e1d ranks first among the cities of Guzer\u00e1t, and is one of the most picturesque and artistic in the whole Bombay Presidency. It stands on the raised left bank of the S\u00e1barmati river, about 173 feet above mean sea level. The walls of the city stretch east and west for rather more than a mile, and enclose an area of about 2 square miles. They are from 15 to 20 feet in height, with 14 gates, and at almost every 50 yards, a bastion and tower. The bed of the river is from 500 to 600 yards broad; but except during occasional freshes, the width of the stream is not more than 100 yards. To the north of the city, the channel keeps close to the right bank; and then, crossing through the broad expanse of loose sand, the stream flows close under the walls, immediately above their south-western extremity. The city is built on a plain of light alluvial soil or gor\u00e1t, the surface within the circuit of the walls in no place rising more than 30 feet above the fair-weather level of the river. From its position, therefore, the city is liable to inundation. In 1875, the floods rose above the level of a large portion of the town, causing damage to 3887 houses, valued at about \u00a358,208. Beyond the city walls the country is well wooded, the fields fertile and enclosed by hedges. The surface of the ground is broken at intervals by the remains of the old Hindu suburbs, the ruins of mosques, and Musalm\u00e1n tombs. The walls of the city were first traced by Ahmad Sh\u00e1h (1413\u20131443), the second of the dynasty of the Musalm\u00e1n kings of Guzer\u00e1t, on the site of the more ancient city of Ash\u00e1wal. In A.D. 1486, they were put into thorough repair by the greatest of his successors, Mahm\u00fad Sh\u00e1h Beg\u00e1ra; and at a cost of \u00a325,000 were, in the year 1832, again restored under the British Government. In 1573, Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d was, with the rest of Guzer\u00e1t, subjugated by Akbar.\n\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d was one of the most splendid cities of Western India. There were, according to Ferishta, 360 different wards, each surrounded by a wall. The decay of the Mughal Empire, and the rise of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 power, led to disastrous changes. Early in the 18th century, the authority of the Court of Delhi in Guzer\u00e1t had become merely nominal; and various leaders, Musalm\u00e1n and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1, contended for the possession of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d. In the year 1738, the city fell into the hands of two of these combatants, D\u00e1m\u00e1ji G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r and Momin Kh\u00e1n, who, though of different creeds, had united their armies for the promotion of their personal interests, and now exercised an equal share of authority, and divided the revenues between them. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 chief, D\u00e1m\u00e1ji G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r, having subsequently been imprisoned by the Peshw\u00e1, the\nagent of his Mughal partner took advantage of his absence, to usurp the whole power of the city, but permitted D\u00e1m\u00e1j\u00ed\u2019s collector to realize his master\u2019s pecuniary claims. D\u00e1m\u00e1j\u00ed, on obtaining his liberty, united his forces with those of Raghun\u00e1th R\u00e1o, who was engaged in an expedition for establishing the Peshw\u00e1\u2019s claims in Guzer\u00e1t. In the troubles that followed, combined Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 armies gained possession of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d in 1753. The city was subsequently recaptured by Momin Kh\u00e1n in 1755\u201356, and finally acquired by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in 1757. In 1780, it was stormed and captured by a British force under General Goddard. The British, however, did not then retain it. The place was restored to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, with whom it remained till 1818, when, on the overthrow of the Peshw\u00e1\u2019s power, it reverted to the British Government.\n\nIn the days of its prosperity, the city is said to have contained a population of about 900,000 souls; and so great was its wealth, that some of the traders and merchants were believed to have fortunes of not less than one million sterling. During the disorders of the latter part of the 18th century, Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d suffered severely, and in 1818, when it came under British rule, was greatly depopulated and a melancholy wreck. In 1851, it contained a population of 97,048, in 1872 of 116,873, and in 1881 of 124,767 souls in the city, and 2854 in the cantonments. The Hindus, numbering 86,544, or 67\u00b781 per cent. of the entire population, form the wealthiest and most influential class. The Sar\u00e1waks or Jains come next in the order of importance, being the wealthy traders, merchants, and money-lenders of the town. The Kunb\u00ed caste supplies a large proportion of the weavers and other artisans. Though the majority of Musalm\u00e1ns, who number 27,124, or 21\u00b725 per cent. of the entire population, seek employment as weavers, labourers, and peons, there are a few wealthy families who trade in silk and piece goods.\n\nAhmad\u00e1b\u00e1d is the head-quarters of the Guzer\u00e1t Jain or Sar\u00e1wak sect, who have upwards of 120 temples here. Though in and around the city there is no place deemed holy enough to draw worshippers from any great distance, no less than twenty-four fairs are held, and every third year the Hindu ceremony of walking round the city barefooted is observed.\n\nThe peculiarity of the houses of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d is, that they are generally built in blocks or pol, varying in size from small courts of from five to ten houses, to large quarters of the city containing as many as 10,000 inhabitants. The larger blocks are generally crossed by one main street with a gate at each end, and are subdivided into smaller courts and blocks, each with its separate gate branching off from either side of the chief thoroughfare.\n\nAhmad\u00e1b\u00e1d was formerly celebrated for its commerce and manufac-\ntures in cloth of gold and silver, fine silk and cotton fabrics, articles of gold, silver, steel, enamel, mother-of-pearl, lacquered ware, and fine woodwork. The prosperity of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, says a native proverb, hangs on three threads\u2014silk, gold, and cotton; and though its manufactures are now on a smaller scale than formerly, these industries still support a large section of the population. All the processes connected with the manufacture of silk and brocaded goods are carried on in the city. The raw silk comes through Bombay from China, Bengal, Bussorah, and Bokh\u00e1ra, the yearly supply of about 200,000 lbs. of silk being valued at \u00a3150,000. Bokh\u00e1ra silk has but recently been introduced in small quantities. It arrives ready made for weaving, and is used only for the woof. Of both the white and yellow varieties of China silk, the consumption is large. Bussorah silk arrives in a raw state. The best is valued at 36s. to 38s. a pound. The Bengal silk holds almost the same position in the market as silk imported from Bussorah. Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d silk goods find a market in Bombay, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, Central India, N\u00e1gpur, and the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s Dominions.\n\nThe manufacture of gold and silver thread, which is worked into the richer varieties of silk cloth and brocade, supports a considerable number of people. Tin and electro-plating is also carried on to some extent. Many families are also engaged as hand-loom weavers, working up cotton cloth. In addition, four steam factories, established within the last twenty years, give employment to about 2000 hands in spinning and weaving. Black-wood carving is another important industry, and the finest specimens of this class of work may here be seen.\n\nThe common pottery of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d is greatly superior to most of the earthenware manufactures of Western India. The clay is collected under the walls of the town, and is fashioned into domestic utensils, tiles, bricks, and toys. To give the clay a bright colour, the potters use red ochre, or ramchi, white earth, or kh\u00e1ri, and mica or abrak, either singly or mixed together. No glaze is employed, but the surface of the vessels is polished by the friction either of a piece of bamboo or of a string of agate pebbles. A few of the potters are Musalm\u00e1ns, but the majority are Hindus. A considerable manufacture of shoes and leather work generally gives employment to a large number of the people.\n\nAhmad\u00e1b\u00e1d has long been famous for its manufacture of paper, which is exported to various parts of the Bombay Presidency, including the Native States of Guzer\u00e1t, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, and Cutch. A small quantity finds its way into the territories subject to Sindhia and Holkar. In consequence of foreign competition, the manufacture has of late years declined. At present, its use is confined to the Native States, and the native mercantile classes, whose system of book-keeping and mode of binding require tough and close-grained paper. For the same reason, though stamped paper is now imported from England, the vernacular\nregisters in Government offices are still kept on Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d paper. Six kinds are manufactured, chiefly from jute rags, in sheets $17\\frac{1}{4}$ to $29\\frac{1}{2}$ inches long, and in breadth from 16 inches to $27\\frac{3}{4}$ inches. The price of a sheet varies, according to size and quality, from $\\frac{1}{8}$d. to $2\\frac{1}{2}$d. Raw jute or other fibre is seldom worked up, the material commonly used being old gunny bags and other kinds of jute sackcloth, mixed with pieces of damaged European paper. The craft, like many other industries in Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, is a guild monopoly. The workers are all Muhammadans, and the trade is regulated by an association called the paper guild, k\u00e1gdini jam\u00e1t.\n\nThere are within municipal limits about $27\\frac{1}{2}$ miles of road fit for the passage of wheeled vehicles. The principal streets run across the town from north to south. The Oliphant road, 40 feet broad, with side footpaths, runs from west to east. It does not pass through the thickly peopled parts of the city, but rows of houses are gradually rising on either side of it. The streets are kept well watered, and are lighted at night by kerosene oil lamps. There are in all 64 Hindu caste lodges, and 14 markets. Besides the chief market places near the centre of the city, grain markets are held in open spaces. There are two libraries in the city, the principal one being located in the Hem\u00e1bh\u00e1i Institute, the upstairs hall of which is used for public lectures and meetings.\n\nThe military cantonment is situated to the north of the city, at a distance of $3\\frac{1}{2}$ miles. The road leading to the cantonment, lined with avenues of fine trees, forms a favourite resort of the inhabitants, both in the morning and evening. The camp is the head-quarters station of the Northern Division of the Bombay Army, commanded by a Major-General.\n\nThe total yearly income of the city municipality amounted in 1881\u201382 to \u00a328,449, and the expenditure to \u00a344,498; incidence of municipal taxation, 4s. 7d. per head. There are, besides the usual public offices, two churches, an arsenal, a hospital, a lunatic asylum, an asylum for lepers, two dispensaries, and 18 Government and missionary schools, of which 4 are girls\u2019 schools; in addition, about 100 private schools are taught by Br\u00e1hmans. A home for animals, called the Panjr\u00e1pol, is another interesting institution of the city.\n\nThe well-water is brackish and unfit for drinking. The richer classes use for drinking purposes rain-water stored in cisterns in their own houses; the lower orders obtain their supplies either direct from the river, or from the water pumped into the city at the expense of the municipality.\n\nThe Architecture of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d illustrates in a very interesting and characteristic manner, the result of the contact of Saracenic with Hindu forms. The vigorous aggressiveness of Isl\u00e1m, here found itself confronted by strongly vital Jain types, and submitted to a compromise\nin which the latter predominate. Even the mosques are Hindu or Jain in their details, with a Saracenic arch thrown in occasionally, not from any constructive want, but as a symbol of Isl\u00e1m. The exquisite open tracery of some of the windows and screens, form memorials\u2014which no one who has seen them can forget\u2014of the wonderful plasticity of stone in Indian hands. \u2018The Muhammadans,\u2019 says Mr. James Fergusson, \u2018had here forced themselves upon the most civilised and the most essentially building race at that time in India; and the Ch\u00e1luky\u00e1s conquered their conquerors, and forced them to adopt forms and ornaments which were superior to any the invaders knew or could have introduced. The result is a style which combines all the elegance and finish of Jain or Ch\u00e1lukyan art, with a certain largeness of conception, which the Hindu never quite attained, but which is characteristic of the people, who at this time were subjecting all India to their sway.\u2019 The exigencies of space preclude any attempt at detailed description.\n\nThe following list of the remains of most interest in the city and its neighbourhood, has been supplied by the Archaeological Surveyor:\n\nI. Mosques\u2014(1) Ahmad Sh\u00e1h; (2) Haibat Kh\u00e1n; (3) Sayyid Alam; (4) M\u00e1lik Alam; (5) R\u00e1n\u00ed Isni (not S\u00edpri); (6) S\u00eddi Sayyid; (7) Kutab Sh\u00e1h; (8) Sayyid Usmani; (9) Mi\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n Chishti; (10) S\u00eddi Bas\u00edr; (11) Muh\u00e1fiz Kh\u00e1n; (12) Achat B\u00edbi; (13) Dast\u00far Kh\u00e1n; (14) Muhammad Ghaus, and the Queen\u2019s and Jam\u00e1 Mosque.\n\nII.

Also the section on Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d city in the Bombay Gazetteer, vol. iv. 1879, which I have referred to at the end of the last article, q.v.]\n\nAhmadgarh.\u2014Village in Bulandshahr District, North-Western Provinces; distant 28 miles south-east from Bulandshahr, and 6 miles north from Pah\u00e1su. Post-office and school. Weekly market. North of the village is a small lake, on the borders of which are ruins of fine buildings founded by Ani R\u00e1i, the Badg\u00fajar R\u00e1j\u00e1 of An\u00fapshahr, and named after his title of Ahmad Kh\u00e1ni.\n\nAhmadnagar (Ahmednagar).\u2014A District in the Deccan, or Central\nDivision, Bombay Presidency, lying between $18^\\circ 20' 0''$ and $20^\\circ 0' 0''$ N. lat., and $73^\\circ 42' 40''$ and $75^\\circ 45' 50''$ E. long. Area, 6666 square miles. Population (1881) 751,228 souls.\n\nTo the north-west and north lies N\u00e1sik District; on the north-east the line of the God\u00e1vari river separates Ahmadnagar from the Dominions of the Niz\u00e1m. On the extreme east, from the point where the boundary leaves the God\u00e1vari to the extreme northern point of the Shol\u00e1pur District, it touches the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s Dominions, a part of the frontier being marked by the river S\u00edna. On the south-east and south-west lie the districts of Shol\u00e1pur and Poona, the limit towards Shol\u00e1pur being marked by no natural boundary. But to the south-west, the line of the Bh\u00edma, and its tributary the Ker\u00e1, separates Ahmadnagar from Poona; and farther north the District stretches westwards, till its lands and those of Th\u00e1n\u00e1 (Tanna) District meet on the slopes of the Sahy\u00e1dri hills. Except in the east, where the Dominions of the Niz\u00e1m run inwards to within ten miles of the city of Ahmadnagar, the District is compact and unbroken by the territories of Native States, or outlying portions of other British Districts.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The principal geographical feature of the District is the chain of the Sahy\u00e1dri hills, which extend along a considerable portion of the western boundary, throwing out many spurs and ridges towards the east. Three of these spurs continue to run eastwards into the heart of the District, the valleys between them forming the beds of the Prawar\u00e1 and M\u00fal\u00e1 rivers. From the right bank of the M\u00fal\u00e1, the land stretches in hills and elevated plateaux to the Ghor river, the southern boundary of the District. Except near the centre of the eastern boundary, where the hills rise to a considerable height, the surface of the District eastwards, beyond the neighbourhood of the Sahy\u00e1dri hills, becomes gradually less broken. The highest peaks in the District are in the north-west; the hill of Kalsub\u00e1i, believed to attain a height of more than 5000 feet above the level of the sea; and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 forts of Kil\u00e1 Patt\u00e1 and Harischandragarh. Farther south, about 18 miles west of the city of Ahmadnagar, the hill of P\u00e1rmer rises about 500 feet above the surrounding table-land, and 3240 feet above sea level.\n\nThe chief river of the District is the God\u00e1vari, which for about 40 miles forms the boundary on the north and north-east. Farther south, the streams of the Prawar\u00e1 and M\u00fal\u00e1, flowing eastwards from the Sahy\u00e1dri hills along two parallel valleys, unite, and after a joint course of about 12 miles fall into the God\u00e1vari in the extreme north-east of the District. About 25 miles below the junction of the Prawar\u00e1, the God\u00e1vari receives on its right bank the river Ghor, which rises in the high land in the east, and has a northerly course of about 35 miles. The southern parts of the District are drained by two main rivers, the S\u00edna\nand the Ker\u00e1, both tributaries of the Bh\u00edma. Of these, the S\u00edna, rising in the high lands to the right of the M\u00fal\u00e1, flows in a straight course towards the south-east. The river Kera, rising in the Sahy\u00e1dri range and flowing to the south-east, separates the Districts of Ahmadnagar and Poona. The Bh\u00edma itself, with a winding course of about 35 miles, forms the southern limit of the District. Besides the main rivers, there are several tributary streams and watercourses, many of which in ordinary seasons continue to flow throughout the year. Except in some of the villages situated in the high lands, where water is scarce, the District is fairly supplied with streams and wells.\n\nThere are no minerals or quarries deserving notice. Though there are no large forests, a considerable area of hill land, covered with small trees, has been set apart to form State reserves. Of domestic animals, the bullocks, varying in value from \u00a32 to \u00a36, are small and weak, two pairs of them being required to draw a plough. The horses, especially those bred near the river Bh\u00edma, though small, are strong, and formerly mounted the famous Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 cavalry. Pains are taken by Government to improve the local breed, nine stallions being stationed in the District for this purpose. There is also a breed of ponies, strong and enduring, and well suited to the wants of the people. In the forests and mountains there are tigers, bears, panthers, and bison, and in the plain country wolves abound. The rivers contain considerable quantities of fish, for the most part of an inferior description.\n\nHistory.\u2014A summary of the chief events in the history of the District, which from 1508 to 1636 formed one of the Musalm\u00e1n kingdoms of the Deccan, will be found in the article on the City of Ahmadnagar. On the fall of the Peshw\u00e1\u2019s power in 1817, the country was formed into a British District.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1872 returned a total population of 773,938 persons, or 116\u00b743 to the square mile. The next regular general Census, of 1881, showed a total population of 751,228 in an area of 6666 square miles, the average density being 112\u00b769 persons per square mile; the males numbered 381,602; the females 369,626, and the percentage of males was 50\u00b779. Of the total population in 1881, 684,184, or 91\u00b707 per cent., were Hindus; 39,592, or 5\u00b727 per cent., Musalm\u00e1ns; 179 P\u00e1rs\u00eds; 15,497, or 2\u00b706 per cent., Jains; 4821, or 0\u00b764 per cent., Christians; 65 Jews; 8 Sikhs; and 6876, or 0\u00b791 per cent., aboriginals. Classified according to castes, the Br\u00e1hmans numbered 32,581; R\u00e1jputs, 2794; Ling\u00e1yat, 3229; Kunb\u00ed, 304,818; Kol\u00ed, 26,753; M\u00e1l\u00ed, 32,639; Banj\u00e1ri, 30,072; Shimpi, 3451; Dhob\u00ed, 4041; Nh\u00e1vi, 7928; Koshti, 7933; Kumbh\u00e1r, 6068; Loh\u00e1r, 3802; Son\u00e1r, 8139; S\u00fat\u00e1r, 7858; T\u00e9li, 7206; Cham\u00e1r, 13,523; Dh\u00e1ngar, 39,527; M\u00e1ng, 19,165; Mah\u00e1r, 62,091; and \u2018other\u2019 Hindus (low castes), 59,881.\nThe bulk of the population belongs to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 race, who are generally cultivators and artificers, and, as a rule, darker in complexion than the Br\u00e1hmans. Besides the low or depressed castes,\u2014Mah\u00e1r, M\u00e1ng, Dh\u00e1ngar, Cham\u00e1r, and R\u00e1mosi,\u2014there are many wandering tribes, of which the chief are called Wad\u00e1ri, Kaik\u00e1di, and Kol\u00e1ti. Of hill tribes, beside Bh\u00edls, the Th\u00e1kurs, W\u00e1ralis, and Kathodis may be mentioned; they form a distinct race, generally met with in the wilder tracts of the western District. The members of these tribes are still fond of an unsettled life, and have to be carefully watched to prevent their resuming their predatory habits. With the exception of a few Bor\u00e1s who engage in trade and are well-to-do, the Musalm\u00e1ns are in poor circumstances, being for the most part sunk in debt. Since the District has come under British management, there has been a large immigration of M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris. These men come by the route of Indore and Kh\u00e1ndesh, and are almost entirely engaged in money-lending, and trading in cloth and grain.\n\nOf the Musalm\u00e1ns, 39,545 are Sunnis, and 47 Shi\u00e1s. The P\u00e1rs\u00eds are all Sh\u00e1hansh\u00e1hi, and the Jews are all Beni-Israel. Of the Christian population, the greater number have been converted from the Mah\u00e1r and M\u00e1ng low-castes since 1831, by missionaries belonging to an American Society. Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 is the general language of the country, though some of the hill tribes in the west speak a dialect of their own.\n\nThere were, in 1881, 1334 inhabited State and alienated villages, including 7 towns, giving an average of one village to five square miles, and 563\u00b713 inhabitants to each village. The villages are, as a rule, surrounded by high mud walls; but of late years these fortifications have been allowed to fall into disrepair. The total number of occupied houses in 1881 was 105,386, and of unoccupied, 29,408, or an average of 20\u00b720 to each square mile; number of persons per occupied house, 7\u00b712. The cost of building a large stone house of the better class is reported to vary from \u00a3400 to \u00a3800. The houses contain, for the most part, very scanty furniture. Even the dwelling of a well-to-do trader has but little except a small stock of brass vessels, some beds of the cheapest description, and a few raz\u00e1\u00eds or cotton-stuffed quilts. Unlike the artisans of Guzer\u00e1t, the mechanics of Ahmadnagar do not associate together in trade guilds.\n\nThe chief towns of the District are\u2014(1) Ahmadnagar city, with a population of 32,903 souls in city and 4589 in cantonments; (2) Sangamer, population 8796; (3) P\u00e1thardi, population 6734; (4) Kharda, population 5562; (5) Shrigonda, population 5278; (6) Bhing\u00e1r, population 5106; and (7) Sonai, population 5483.\n\nThe staff of village servants includes, as a rule, the head man (p\u00e1tel); the accountant (kulkarni); the family priest (joshi or bh\u00e1t); the potter (kumbh\u00e1r); the barber (nh\u00e1vi); the carpenter (sut\u00e1r); the blacksmith\n(loh\u00e1r); the shoemaker (cham\u00e1r); the tailor (shimp\u00ed); the washerman (parit); the sweeper (bhangi); the watchman (rakhw\u00e1ld\u00e1r); the Musalm\u00e1n priest (mull\u00e1); the temple keeper (guru). Villagers join together to build temples or dig wells. The rich give a contribution in money, while the poor supply their labour. Depressed castes, such as Mah\u00e1rs, M\u00e1ngs, Cham\u00e1rs, and Dh\u00e1ngars, are not allowed to draw water from the village tank. In most villages, the head man still possesses much influence. He is on all occasions put forward as the official representative of his village. He is also the social head, and on the occasion of a wedding in his family, or of the birth of a son, gives a dinner to the whole community. The village council (panch\u00e1yat) decides questions of caste and sometimes of money disputes. The Muhammadan priest or mull\u00e1, besides attending the mosque, kills the sheep and goats offered by the Hindus as sacrifices to their gods. So thoroughly has this strange custom been incorporated with the village community, that Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s generally decline to eat the flesh of a sheep or goat unless its throat has been cut by a mull\u00e1 or other competent Musalm\u00e1n.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Exclusive of lands belonging to other territory situated within its limits, Ahmadnagar District contains a total area of 4,266,240 acres, of which 2,519,379 acres are arable assessed land, and the remainder uncultivable waste. Of the arable assessed land, 2,278,125 acres were in 1881-82 under cultivation. The soil varies much in different parts of the District. Towards the north and east, it is as a rule a rich black loam; while in the hilly parts towards the west, it is frequently light and sandy. By reason of this variation in soil, it is said that a cultivator with ten acres of land in the north of the District is better off than one with a holding twice as large in the south. Though a single pair of bullocks cannot till enough land to support a family, many cultivators have only one pair, and manage to get their fields ploughed by borrowing and lending bullocks among each other. Garden lands are manured; but, as a rule, for ordinary dry crops nothing is done to enrich the soil. Cultivators are employed in ploughing in March, April, and May; in sowing the early khar\u00edf crops in July; and in harvesting the early crops from November to February. There are no tanks for irrigation, but there is a good deal of irrigation from wells, especially in the northern parts. The District, though possessing in many parts a fertile soil and a fair supply of water, not unfrequently suffers from drought. To meet this evil, three large irrigation works have been constructed by the Government. These works together can supply 41,510 acres, but in 1876 water was used for less than 500 acres. The ordinary Bombay land revenue system prevails throughout the District. Lands are held under the survey tenure, bearing rents fixed as far as possible according to the intrinsic value of the soil, and liable to revision at the expiry of a lease generally\nof thirty years' duration. The first settlement took place in 1843-44, and re-settlement operations are now in progress; they were commenced in 1876-77, the total cost up to 1881-82 being \u00a333,824. In 1881-82 the gross land revenue receipts were \u00a331,661; after the re-settlement, the receipts in that year amounted to \u00a343,140; the total increase of land revenue resulting from the re-settlement being \u00a335,232 since 1876-77.\n\nThe stock in the possession of the cultivators of State villages during the year 1881-82 was returned at 59,332 ploughs; 22,294 carts; 246,228 bullocks; 42,231 buffaloes; 163,540 cows; 17,451 horses; 417,197 sheep and goats; and 8066 asses. The staple crops are wheat (Triticum vulgare) and gram (Cicer arietinum), in the vicinity of the rivers God\u00e1vari and Bh\u00edma; Indian millet or jo\u00e1r (Sorghum vulgare) throughout the rest of the District, except in the inferior soils near the hills, where the chief crop is millet or b\u00e1jra (Holcus spicatus). These grains are grown both on dry and irrigated lands. Among other products, sugar-cane, p\u00e1n (Piper betel), and vegetables of many kinds are raised in irrigated land. In some of the superior soils near the God\u00e1vari, hemp (Crotalaria juncea) is sown. In the north-east, cotton (Gossypium herbaceum) and inferior rice (Oryza sativa) are cultivated to a small extent. Of the area under cultivation in 1881-82, inclusive of the acreage twice cropped (11,485), grain crops occupied 1,662,250 acres, or 72.96 per cent.; pulses, 162,165 acres, or 7.12 per cent.; oil seeds, 88,226, or 3.87 per cent.; cotton and other fibres, 38,682 acres, or 1.69 per cent.; tobacco, 6428 acres; and miscellaneous crops, 11,937 acres, or 0.52 per cent.\n\nAhmadnagar District is not subject to blights or floods. Occasionally wheat is affected by a disease called t\u00e1mbr\u00e1. Under this disease, as the name implies, the grain turns a copper colour and withers away. Though the country is liable to drought, scarcity, deserving the name of a famine, has seldom occurred since the District came into the hands of the British. In 1791, 1792, and 1794, there was much misery owing to the increase in the price of grain, occasioned by the disturbed state of the country. A few years later (1803-04) the depredations of the Pind\u00e1ris, who accompanied the army of Holkar, caused much suffering, and so severe was the distress that children are said to have been sold for food. The price of wheat rose to 4s. a pound. The last severe famine occurred in 1877. The prevailing prices of produce in the District in 1881-82 were, for wheat, 5s. 1d. per maund of 82 lbs. for rice, best, 8s. 10\u00bdd.; common, 7s. 3\u00bed.; b\u00e1jri, 2s. 10\u00bdd.; jo\u00e1r\u00ed, 2s. 3d.; gram, 3s. 3d.; split peas (d\u00e1l), 4s. 3\u00bed.; salt, 6s. 9d.; and flour (wheat), 5s. 10\u00bdd.\n\nTrade, etc.\u2014In former days a considerable trade between Upper India and the seaboard passed through this District. The carriers\nwere a class of Banj\u00e1ris called Lum\u00e1ns, owners of herds of bullocks. But since the opening of the two lines of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, the course of traffic has changed. Trade is carried on almost entirely by means of permanent markets. From all parts of the District, millet and gram are exported to Poona and Bombay. The imports consist chiefly of English piece-goods, tin sheets, metals, groceries, salt, and silk. The chief manufacturing industries are the weaving of s\u00e1ris or women's robes and inferior turbans, and the manufacture of copper and brass pots. Weaving is said to have been introduced into the District soon after the founding of the city of Ahmadnagar (A.D. 1494) by a member of the Bh\u00e1ngri\u00e1 family, a man of considerable means, and a weaver by caste. Of late years the industry has risen in importance. This change seems due to the fall in the price of yarn, now spun by steam-power at Bombay. The number of hand-looms in Ahmadnagar city alone has increased from 213 in 1820 to 2000 in 1882. The yarn consumed in these looms is said to come chiefly from Bombay, either imported from Europe or spun in the Bombay steam factories. Ahmadnagar s\u00e1ris have a high reputation; and dealers flock from neighbouring Districts and from the Niz\u00e1m's Dominions to purchase them. Many of the weavers are entirely in the hands of money-lenders, who advance the raw material and take possession of the article when made up. The workmen are generally paid at the rate of from 2s. to 4s. for a piece of cloth from 14 to 16 cubits long, and from 2 to 2\u00bd cubits wide. A piece of cloth of this size would take a man and his wife from 2 to 4 days to weave. An ordinary worker will earn at his loom about 10s. a month. The weavers, as a class, are said to be addicted to the use of intoxicating liquors. In 1820 this craft was almost entirely confined to members of the weaver caste, S\u00e1li or Kosti. But many classes, such as Br\u00e1hmans, Kunbis, Kong\u00e1dis, and M\u00e1l\u00eds, now engage in the work. Among former industries that have died out, are the manufactures of paper and carpets. The place of the country paper has been supplied by cheaper articles brought from China and Europe, and Ahmadnagar carpets have ceased to be in demand.\n\nExcept three or four mercantile houses in the city of Ahmadnagar, there are no large banking establishments in the District. The business of money-lending is chiefly in the hands of M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri Baniy\u00e1s, most of them Jains by religion, who are said to have followed the camps of the Mughal armies at the end of the 15th century. They did not, however, commence to settle in the District in large numbers until the accession of the English in the first quarter of the present century. Since then they have almost supplanted the indigenous money-lenders, the Deccani Br\u00e1hmans. A Baniy\u00e1 from M\u00e1rwar, anxious to start as a money-lender, generally brings what capital he may have in bills of\nexchange, or in gold and silver ornaments. On arrival he finds many of his caste fellows and acquaintances ready to give him a helping hand. For a month or two he may travel about, making inquiries and learning the course of local trade. He then decides on some village where he thinks he can see his way to a good business. He rents a small house and opens a shop, offering for sale either piece-goods, grain, or groceries. He is never overreached in a bargain, never sells save at a profit, and is most frugal in his personal expenditure. He very soon commences to lend small sums on the security of household articles or personal ornaments. As his connection gradually enlarges, he advances money on crops and land. His stock of grain increases from year to year. Some of it he sends away to Poona or Bombay, storing the rest underground against a failure of crops or a rise of prices. When he has been eight or ten years in the Deccan, he returns to M\u00e1rw\u00e1r to bring some of his family to his new home. As years go on, his profit increases, and he grows wealthy. He builds himself a large house, marries his children into the families of other M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri settlers, and probably never again leaves the Deccan.\n\nThe rate of interest charged for an advance of grain is from one-fourth to one-half the value of the grain advanced. The same rates are charged whether the grain is advanced for seed or for the support of the borrower and his family. Among the cultivating classes, few are free from debt, and many of the poorer peasants are said to be in hopelessly involved circumstances. The depressed condition of the cultivators of this District was brought to the notice of Government between 1848 and 1858. In the following years, the high prices of agricultural produce which accompanied the American war helped to free them from their difficulties; but the recent fall in prices, combined with the increased pressure of creditors for payment, was accompanied by much general discontent in the District, and by several serious offences against the persons and property of money-lenders.\n\nThe depressed condition of the peasantry in this part of India has since formed a subject of inquiry by a special Commission appointed by the Government of India. As a rule, they are sober, indulging in the use neither of liquor nor of opium. An agricultural labourer is usually paid at the rate of about \u00a32 a year and his food. Wages for day-labourers employed in harvesting are, as a rule, 5 sheaves per 100 of the number cut and uprooted and tied by the individual, whether man or woman. For work on the threshing-floor, one pound of grain, or about 1\u00bdd., or 1 anna per 100 sheaves, trodden out or winnowed is allowed. For other work, the wages are\u2014for a woman, from 2\u00bdd. to 3d.; children, 1\u00bdd., paid in cash, weekly or monthly. Masons and carpenters earn from 1s. to 1s. 3d. a day; domestic servants in native houses, 6s. a month, besides food.\nThe Dhond and Manmad State Railway, connecting the south-eastern and north-eastern branches of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, at the stations named, runs for a distance of 122\u00bd miles (very nearly its entire length, 145 miles) through this District, via the town of Ahmadnagar; and the District is besides well supplied with roads. Of a total length of 370 miles of road within its limits, 31 miles are bridged and metalled, 274 are spread with gravel or sand, and 31 made fit for traffic during the monsoon, while 65 miles are unmetalled. All the main lines of communication have been constructed by the State, and are kept in repair at a yearly charge of not less than \u00a35400. The metal used is basaltic trap, of which there is a plentiful supply in almost every part of the District.\n\nAdministration, etc.\u2014For administrative purposes, the Ahmadnagar District is divided into eleven taluks or Sub-divisions, viz. Ahmadnagar, Parner, Sangamner, Kopargaon, Shrigonda, Akola, Jamkhed, Kaljat, Newasa, Sheogaon, Rahuri. The administration in revenue matters is ordinarily entrusted to a Collector and 3 assistants, of whom 2 are covenanted civil servants. For the settlement of civil disputes there are 9 courts, besides the District Court. Thirty officers conduct the administration of criminal justice, of whom 5 are Europeans.\n\nIn the year 1881-82, the total strength of the District or regular police force, was 626. The total cost of maintaining the force was \u00a312,085, 14s., of which \u00a3254 was raised from local sources. These figures show one man to every 10'65 square miles as compared with the area, and one man to every 1200 souls as compared with the population. The cost of maintenance is equal to \u00a31, 16s. 3d. per square mile, or 3\u00bdd. per head of the population. In 1881 the Ahmadnagar jail contained a daily average of 204 convicted prisoners, including 21 females, showing one prisoner to every 3794 of the population; the total cost was \u00a31316, 4s. od., or \u00a36, 6s. od. per head.\n\nThe District contains 54 post-offices and a Government telegraph office. There is a military cantonment with a population of 4589 persons.\n\nThe District local funds, created since 1863 for works of public utility and rural education, in 1881-82 yielded a revenue of \u00a313,388, against an expenditure of \u00a313,729. There are 4 municipalities in the District, namely: Ahmadnagar town, population 32,905; Sangamner, 8796; Bhingar, 5106; and Puntamba, 4094. In 1881-82 the total municipal receipts amounted to \u00a36628, and the total expenditure to \u00a35555. The incidence of taxation varied from 2\u00bdd. to 3s. 4\u00bdd. per head. Land revenue in 1881-82, \u00a3121,985; gross revenue, \u00a3176,612, including \u00a312,923 on account of excise (spirits and drugs).\n\nBesides the civil hospital in Ahmadnagar city, there are three dispensaries\u2014at Sangamner, Nivasa, and Sheogion. In 1881-82 a total\nof 30,063 patients were treated, of whom 405 were in-door patients. The number of vaccinations was 22,144 in 1881\u201382. The people are said to consent willingly to the operation.\n\nThe number of deaths reported in the year ending 1881\u201382 was 21,279, showing an average mortality for the year of 28\u00b731 per thousand of the population. During the same year the number of births is returned at 24,313, or 12,554 males and 11,759 females, being an average birth-rate of 31 per thousand of the population.\n\nIn the year 1881\u201382 there were 257 Government schools, including 19 girls\u2019 schools, or an average of 1 school for every 5 villages, or to 31 square miles, with an attendance of 13,675 pupils. In Ahmadnagar there are 2 libraries and 3 newspapers.\n\nClimate.\u2014The rainy season generally begins in the early part of June, and ends in November. The average annual rainfall during the ten years ending with 1881 was returned at 26\u00b703 inches; in 1875 the total registered was 20\u00b759 inches. The principal diseases are fever and smallpox. Guinea-worm and ophthalmia are also very common complaints.\n\n[For further information concerning Ahmadnagar District, see Selections from the Records of the Bombay Government, No. cxxiii., New Series, containing papers relating to the revision of assessment in six talukas of the Ahmadnagar Collectorate, printed 1871.

Area 619 square miles. Contains 2 towns and 107 villages. Population (1881) 108,950 souls, of whom 55,333 are males and 53,617 females; Hindus are returned at 94,728, Muhammadans at 9,416, and others at 4806.\n\nAhmadnagar (Ahmednagar) City.\u2014Chief town of the District of the same name, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 19\u00b0 5' N., long. 74\u00b0 55' E.; area, 3 square miles; population in 1881, 37,492 souls, including 4589 inhabiting the cantonments. The Hindus number 29,239; Muhammadans, 5934; Jains, 915; Christians, 1128; Parsis, 176; \u2018others,\u2019 100. Ahmadnagar is the third among the cities of the Deccan and the seventeenth in the Bombay Presidency. It is situated on the plain of the river Sina, about 12 miles from its source, and on its left bank. The city has a commonplace appearance, most of the houses being of the ordinary Deccan type, built of mud-coloured sun-burnt bricks, with flat roofs. It is surrounded by an earthen wall about 12 feet in height, with decayed bastions and gates. This wall is said to have been built about the year A.D. 1562 by King Husain Nizam Shah. The adjacent country is closed in on two sides by hills. Ahmadnagar was founded in A.D. 1494 by Ahmad Nizam Shah, originally an officer of the Bakhmani State, who, on the breaking\nup of that Government, assumed the title and authority of an independent ruler, and fixed his capital at this place, named after its founder. It was built on the site of a more ancient town called Bingar. Ahmad Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h was succeeded in 1598 by his son Burhan Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h. In his reign the State attained high prosperity, until his defeat by Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Adil Sh\u00e1h, king of Bijapur, in A.D. 1546. Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h died in A.D. 1553, and was succeeded by his son Husain Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h. This prince also suffered a very severe defeat from the King of Bijapur, in A.D. 1562, losing several hundred elephants and 660 pieces of cannon; amongst them the great gun now at Bijapur, considered to be one of the largest pieces of brass ordnance in the world. Husain Sh\u00e1h of Ahmadnagar was subsequently confederated with the Kings of Bijapur, Golkonda, and B\u00e1d\u00e1r, against R\u00e1j\u00e1 R\u00e1m of Vijayanagar, whom in A.D. 1564 they defeated, made prisoner, and put to death at T\u00e1l\u00edkot, in the present British District of Belg\u00e1um. Husain Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, nicknamed Div\u00e1n\u00e1, or the insane, from the extravagance of his conduct, was in A.D. 1588 cruelly murdered by his son Miran Husain Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, who, having reigned ten months, was deposed and put to death. Miran was succeeded by his nephew Ism\u00e1il Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, who, after a reign of two years, was deposed by his own father, who succeeded by the title of Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h II., and died in A.D. 1594. His son and successor, Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, after a reign of four months, was killed in battle against the King of Bijapur. Ahmad, a reputed relative, was raised to the throne; but, as it was soon afterwards ascertained that he was not a lineal descendant, he was expelled the city; and Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h, the infant son of Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, was placed on the throne under the influence of his great-aunt, Ch\u00e1nd B\u00edbi (widow of Ali Adil Sh\u00e1h, king of Bijapur, and sister of Murtaza Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h of Ahmadnagar), a woman of heroic spirit, who, when the city was besieged by Mur\u00e1d, the son of Akbar, defended in person the breach which had been made in the rampart, and compelled the assailants to raise the siege. These events took place in 1595. In 1599, Prince Dany\u00e1l Mirz\u00e1, son of Akbar, at the head of a Mughal army, captured the city of Ahmadnagar. Nominal kings, however, continued to exercise a feeble sway until 1636, when Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n finally overthrew the monarchy. In 1759, the city was betrayed to the Peshw\u00e1 by the commandant holding it for the Government of Delhi. In 1797 it was ceded by the Peshw\u00e1 to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 chief Daulat R\u00e1o Sindhia. In 1803, it was invested by a British force under General Wellesley, and surrendered after a resistance of two days. It was, however, shortly after given up to the Peshw\u00e1; but the fort was again occupied by the British in 1817, by virtue of the treaty of Poona. On the fall of the Peshw\u00e1, Ahmadnagar became the head-quarters of the Collectorate of the same name.\nThe population of the city was 17,000 in 1817, and 26,012 in 1850. By 1881, the total population of the city had risen to 32,903, and that of the cantonment to 4589; total, 37,492, namely, males 19,220, and females 18,272. The Hindus numbered 29,239; Muhammadans, 5934; Jains, 915; Christians, 1128; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 176; \u2018others,\u2019 100. Some of the Br\u00e1hmans are tradespeople; most, however, are employed in work requiring education and intellect. The bulk of the population consists of S\u00fadras, engaged in various occupations. The Musalm\u00e1ns are, as a rule, uneducated and indolent. They are employed in weaving, cleaning cotton, and in domestic service in the houses of well-to-do Hindus. The M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris are the most prosperous class. The chief manufacturing industries of the city are the weaving of s\u00e1ris, and the manufacture of copper and brass pots. Ahmadnagar is celebrated for the strength and durability of its carpets. Of the articles manufactured in the city, estimated in 1875\u201376 at about \u00a3111,657, cotton and silk cloths contributed \u00a355,687, and copper and brass pots \u00a343,920. One street is devoted to the houses and shops of grain dealers. The shops of the cloth-sellers form another street. The trade of cloth-selling is chiefly in the hands of M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris, who combine it with money-lending.\n\nHalf a mile to the east of the city stands the fort, built of stone, circular in shape, about 1\u00bd mile in circumference, and surrounded by a wide and deep moat. This building, which stands on the site of a former fortress of earth, said to have been raised in 1488, was erected in its present form by Husain Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, grandson of M\u00e1lik Ahmad, in the year A.D. 1559. In the year 1803 the fort was surrendered to the British army after a severe bombardment of two days. The breach then made in the fort is still visible. The city has numerous specimens of Muhammadan architecture, several of the mosques being now converted into Government offices or used as dwelling-houses by European residents. The Collector\u2019s office is held in a mosque built in the 16th century. The Judge\u2019s Court was originally the palace of a Musalm\u00e1n noble, built about the year 1600; the buildings at present used as a jail and a civil hospital were formerly mosques. Six miles east of the city, on a hill between 700 and 800 feet above the level of the fort and city, stands a large unfinished tomb, now fitted up as a sanitarium for British troops. Close to the city is a marble tablet, let into the wall, which contains the names of the English officers and men who fell in storming it. Ahmadnagar contains an American church, a P\u00e1rs\u00ed agj\u00e1ri (fire temple), and two or three Hindu temples, a High School, with a branch and seven vernacular schools. The municipality was established on the 1st March 1855, and has an income (1881\u201382) of \u00a35610. Since the establishment of the municipality, the roads have been widened and drained, and several new streets opened out. The\ncity is now well supplied with water by various aqueducts from sources ranging from two to six miles from the city. The wells inside the city are brackish.

Estimated area, 802 square miles; villages, 321; occupied houses, 14,076; population (1881) 81,454, namely, males 42,409, and females 39,045; average density of population, 101.5 per square mile. Hindus numbered 78,427; Muhammadans, 2768; Jains, 214; 'others,' 45.\n\nThe principality consists of the famous hill-fortress of Ajaigarh, with the surrounding territory, besides an outlying tract between Jaso and Pann\u00e1. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 lives at Naushahr, a neat, regularly built town at the northern base of the hill on which is perched the ancient fort. The mean elevation of the plateau on the summit of the hill is 1340 feet above sea level, and 860 feet above that of the surrounding country. The fort itself stands 1744 feet above sea level. The eminence is composed of granite, overlaid by a bed of sandstone, and presenting all round a perpendicular face of rock some 50 feet in height. North-east of the main hill, and separated from it by a deep ravine, rises the opposite height of Bihonta. The fort stands on the southern crag, and is enclosed by a rampart running round the bold face of the rock. It is composed in part of exquisitely-carved shafts, pedestals, and cornices, the relics of ancient Jain temples. Over the whole surface of the plateau lies scattered a profusion of ruins, statues, and stone fragments. In their perfect state the temples must have been of great magnificence. At present they are tenanted only by large monkeys, and by serpents of great size, which glide and harbour among the fragments strewing the ground. The fort belongs to the same period as the other famous Bundela stronghold of K\u00e1l\u00ednjar, about the 9th century A.D. Ajaigarh formed a portion of the territories ruled over by the famous Bundela chieftain Chhatar S\u00e1l. On the partition of Bundelkhand after Chhatar S\u00e1l's death, about 1734, the country around Ajaigarh was included in the share allotted to his son Jagat R\u00e1i; but in 1800 it was captured by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s after a six weeks' siege. On the cession of portions of Bunkelkhand to the British in 1803, a British force was sent to take possession of Ajaigarh; but the governor of the fort, in consideration of a bribe, handed it over to one Lakshman Dawa, a famous marauding chieftain. With a view to the pacification of the country, Lakshman Dawa was confirmed by the British in the possession of the State; but in 1809, owing to his persistent turbulence, it was necessary to send a force against him, which captured the fort after a severe engagement. Lakshman Dawa then withdrew, and the British granted the principality to Bakht Singh, the former Bundela ruler. His representative still holds\nthe position of chief, with the title of Sawai Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1, and pays a tribute of \u00a3701. The total revenue from all sources amounts to about \u00a322,500. The State suffered severely from famine during the great scarcity in Upper India in 1868\u201369. The chief maintains a military force of 150 cavalry, 100 infantry, 16 guns and 50 artillerymen. He receives a salute of 11 guns.\n\nAjanta (Adjunta) or Indhy\u00e1dri, also known as S\u00e1tm\u00e1la and Ch\u00e1ndor.\u2014Hill ranges at the south-west extremity of Ber\u00e1r, running into the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s Dominions, and skirting the Bombay District of Kh\u00e1ndesh. They support the northern side of the great table-land of the Deccan, and form the watershed of the feeders of the God\u00e1vari and T\u00e1pt\u00ed rivers. With their spurs and continuation, known as the S\u00e1tm\u00e1la range, they cover the whole of the B\u00e1sim and W\u00fan Districts, and the southern half of Buld\u00e1n\u00e1 District, in Ber\u00e1r, rising into peaks of over 2000 feet in height. They consist, excepting in their alluvial river valleys, almost entirely of trap; well-wooded, picturesque, and abounding in game, they form the retreats of the aboriginal tribes. (See Bhils.) One of their passes in the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s Dominions contains the famous rock temples of Ajanta described in the following article.\n\nAjanta (Adjunta).\u2014A village and ravine celebrated for its cave temples, situated at the head of one of the passes or gh\u00e1ts that lead down from the Ajanta or Indhy\u00e1dri Hills on their south-west face, and near to the Ber\u00e1r and Kh\u00e1ndesh frontiers, but within the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s Dominions. Lat. 20\u00b0 32\u2032 30\u2033 N., long. 75\u00b0 48\u2032 E.; 220 miles north-east of Bombay, 55 miles north-north-east of Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d, in the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s Dominions, and 24 miles north of the field of Assaye. Four miles north-north-west of the town are the caves to which it gives name. The caves have been identified as those mentioned by Hwen Thsang, on the eastern frontier of the kingdom of Pul\u00e1kesi. The best route for visiting these striking memorials of Buddhism, is by the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, from Bombay to Pachora Station (231 miles), and thence by bullock cart to Fard\u00e1pur, where there is a travellers\u2019 rest-house. A bridle path leads from Fard\u00e1pur to the ravine of Len\u00e1pur (3\u00bd miles), in which the caves lie; and it is by this route, not from the village of Ajanta above the pass, that they are best visited. The defile is wooded, lonely, and rugged, the caves being excavated out of a wall of almost perpendicular rock, about 250 feet high, sweeping round in a hollow semicircle, with the W\u00e1ghar\u00e1 stream below, and a wooded rocky promontory jutting out from its opposite bank. The caves extend about a third of a mile from east to west, in the concave scarp composed of amygdaloid trap, at an elevation of 35 to 110 feet above the bed of the torrent. The ravine, a little higher up, ends abruptly in a waterfall of seven leaps (s\u00e1t k\u00fand), from 70 to over 100 feet in height. From the difficulty of access to them, the Ajanta caves were but little\nvisited until within the last forty years; in 1843 Mr. Fergusson's paper on the rock-cut temples of India created a general interest in these remarkable works of art.\n\nTwenty-four monasteries (vih\u0101ras) and five temples (chaityas) have been hewn out of the solid rock, many of them supported by lofty pillars, richly ornamented with sculpture, and covered with highly-finished paintings. Mr. Fergusson's admirable woodcuts and descriptions (History of Indian Architecture, pp. 122-159, ed. 1876) have brought these beautiful excavations within reach of the English public. The following brief description has been condensed chiefly from materials furnished by Mr. Burgess, Archaeological Surveyor to the Government of Bombay. The five chaityas, or cave temples for public worship, are usually about twice as long as they are wide, the largest being 94\u00bd feet by 41\u00bc. The back or inner end of the chaitya is almost always circular; the roofs are lofty and vaulted, some ribbed with wood, others with stone cut in imitation of wooden ribs. A colonnade cut out of the solid rock runs round each, dividing the nave from the aisles. The columns in the most ancient caves are plain octagonal shafts without bases or capitals; in the more modern ones they have both bases and capitals, with richly ornamented shafts. Within the circular end of the cave stands the daghoba (relic-holder), a solid mass of rock, either plain or richly sculptured, consisting of a cylindrical case supporting a cupola (garbha), which in turn is surmounted by a square capital or tee (toran). The twenty-four vih\u0101ras, or Buddhist monasteries, containing cells, are usually square in form, supported by rows of pillars, either running round them and separating the great central hall from the aisles, or disposed in four equidistant lines. In the larger caves, a verandah cut out of the rock, and with cells at either end, shades the entrance; the great hall occupies the middle space; with a small chamber behind, and a shrine containing a figure of Buddha enthroned. The walls on all the three sides are excavated into cells, the dwelling-places (grihas) of the Buddhist monks. The simplest form of the vih\u0101ra or monastery, is a verandah hewn out of the face of the precipice, with cells opening from the back into the rock. Very few of the caves seem to have been completely finished; but nearly all of them appear to have been painted on the walls, ceilings, and pillars, inside and out. Even the sculptures have all been richly coloured. Twenty-five inscriptions\u2014seventeen painted ones in the interior, eight rock inscriptions engraved outside\u2014commemorate the names of pious founders in the Sanskrit and Magadh\u00ed tongues.\n\nOne monastery has its whole fa\u00e7ade richly carved, but as a rule, such ornamentation is confined in the monasteries (vih\u0101ras) to the doorways and windows. More lavish decoration was bestowed upon the temples (chaityas);\u2014the most ancient of them have their fa\u00e7ades sculptured,\nwhile in the more modern ones, the walls, columns, entablatures, and daghoba are covered with carving. The sculpture shows little knowledge of art, and consists chiefly of Buddhas, or Buddhist teachers, in every variety of posture, instructing their disciples.\n\n'The paintings,' writes the Archaeological Surveyor, 'have much higher pretensions, and have even been considered superior to the style of Europe, in the age when they were probably executed. The human figure is represented in every possible variety of position, displaying some slight knowledge of anatomy; and attempts at foreshortening have been made with surprising success. The hands are generally well and gracefully drawn, and rude efforts at perspective are to be met with. Besides paintings of Buddha and his disciples and devotees, there are representations of streets, processions, battles, interiors of houses with the inmates pursuing their daily occupations, domestic scenes of love and marriage and death, groups of women performing religious austerities; there are hunts; men on horseback spearing the wild buffalo; animals, from the huge elephant to the diminutive quail; exhibitions of Cobra di capello, ships, fish, etc. The small number of domestic utensils depicted is somewhat remarkable,\u2014the common earthen waterpot and lotid, a drinking-cup, and one or two other dishes, a tray, an elegantly-shaped sort of jug having an oval body and long thin neck with lip and handle, together with a stone and roller for grinding condiments, being all that are observable. The same lack of weapons of war, either offensive or defensive, is also to be noticed. Swords, straight and crooked, long and short, spears of various kinds, clubs, bows and arrows, a weapon resembling a bayonet reversed, a missile like a quoit with cross-bars in the centre, and shields of different forms, exhaust the list. There is also a thing which bears a strong resemblance to a Greek helmet, and three horses are to be seen yoked abreast, but whether they were originally attached to a war chariot cannot now be determined. The paintings have been in the most brilliant colours\u2014the light and shade are very good; they must have been executed upon a thick layer of stucco. In many places, the colour has penetrated to a considerable depth.' Of the date of these paintings it is difficult to form a very definite estimate, nor are they all of the same age. The scenes represented are generally from the legendary history of Buddha and the J\u00e1takas, the visit of Asita to the infant Buddha, the temptation of Buddha by M\u00e1ra and his forces, Buddhist miracles, the J\u00e1taka of King S\u00edbi, legends of the N\u00e1g\u00e1s, hunting scenes, battle-pieces, the carrying off of the relics of Ceylon, etc.\n\nThe cave temples and monasteries of Ajanta furnish a continuous narrative of Buddhist art during 800 years, from shortly after the reign of Asoka, to shortly before the expulsion of the faith from India. The\noldest of them are assigned to about 200 B.C.; the most modern cannot be placed before the year 600 A.D. For many centuries they enable us to study the progress of Buddhist art, and of Buddhistic conceptions, uninfluenced by Hinduisms. The chief interest of the latest chaitya, about 600 A.D., is to show how nearly Buddhism had approximated to Br\u00e1hmanism, before the convulsions amid which it disappeared. The liberality of the Indian Government had enabled Major Gill to take up his residence in Ajanta, and to prepare a magnificent series of facsimiles from the frescoes. These unfortunately perished in the fire at the Crystal Palace in 1860, but reductions of two of the more important of them, and of eight detached fragments, exist in Mr. Spier's Life in Ancient India, and renewed efforts are being made by Government, to render the matchless art-series of Ajanta available to the western world.

The Province comprises the two tracts known as Ajmere and Merw\u00e1ra (the latter of which see separately), and is entirely surrounded by Native States. It is bounded on the north by Kishangarh and Jodhpur (M\u00e1rw\u00e1r); on the west by Jodhpur (M\u00e1rw\u00e1r); on the south by Udaipur (Meyw\u00e1r); and on the east by Kishangarh and Jaipur (Jeypore). The two tracts originally formed distinct Districts, but they were united under one officer in 1842; they have again been divided, and now form distinct Districts of the Division of Ajmere-Merw\u00e1ra, under the charge of a Commissioner of Ajmere-Merw\u00e1ra, who has his headquarters at the town of Ajmere. The whole forms also a Chief Commissionership; the Agent of the Governor-General for R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, with his head-quarters at Ab\u00fa, being ex officio Chief Commissioner of Ajmere-Merw\u00e1ra. Of the total area of 2711 square miles for the united tracts, kh\u00e1l\u00e1s\u00e1, rent-free, and j\u00e1gir villages occupy 798 square miles in Ajmere; towns, 40 square miles; istimr\u00e1ri estates in Ajmere, 1272 square miles; Meyw\u00e1r-Merw\u00e1ra, 266 square miles; and M\u00e1rw\u00e1r-Merw\u00e1ra, 72 square miles. The number of villages on the Government rent-roll are 698,\u2014Ajmere 368, Merw\u00e1ra 330. The land revenue in 1880\u201381 amounted to \u00a333,050, namely, Ajmere \u00a324,093, Merw\u00e1ra \u00a38957. Gross revenue for the united tracts, \u00a395,843.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of Ajmere-Merw\u00e1ra occupies the crest of the great R\u00e1jput\u00e1na watershed; the rain which falls upon the summit finding its way either by the Chambal into the Bay of Bengal, or by the L\u00fani into the Gulf of Cutch. The plateau on whose centre stands the town of Ajmere may be considered as the highest point in the plains of Hindust\u00e1n; and from the circle of hills which hem it in, the surrounding country slopes away on every side\u2014towards river valleys on the east, south, and west, and towards the desert region on the north. The Ar\u00e1valli range, which divides the plains of M\u00e1rw\u00e1r from the high table-land of Meyw\u00e1r, forms the distinguishing feature of the District. Rising first from the alluvial basin of the Jumna into the ridge at Delhi, this broken chain runs south-westward across the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na States, and crops out to a considerable height near the town of Ajmere, where it assumes the form of several parallel hill ranges. The greatest elevation, on which is perched the fort of T\u00e1r\u00e1garh, rises immediately over the city to a height of 2855 feet above sea level, and between 1300 and 1400 feet above the valley at its base. The N\u00e1g-pah\u00e1r or Serpent hill, 3 miles west of Ajmere, attains a scarcely inferior elevation. About 10 miles from the city, the hills subside for a short distance; but in the neighbourhood of Be\u00e1war, the head-quarters of Merw\u00e1ra, they\nreappear once more as a compact double ridge, enclosing the valley *pargan\u00e1* from which that station derives its name. The two ranges approach each other at Jow\u00e1j\u00e1, 14 miles south of Be\u00e1war, and finally meet at K\u00fakra, in the north of the Todgarh *tahsil*. From this village there is a succession of hills and valleys, to the farthest extremities of the District. On the M\u00e1rv\u00e1r side, the Ar\u00e1valli chain gradually becomes bolder and more precipitous, till it finally merges into the Vindhyan system near the isolated height of Ab\u00fa. The portion of the District east of the range, is an open country, with a slope to the east, and broken only by gentle undulations. West of the N\u00e1g-pah\u00e1r, on the other hand, the plains become an unbroken sea of barren sand. The average level of the valleys is about 1800 feet. Owing to its elevated position at the centre of the watershed, Ajmere-Merw\u00e1r\u00e1 possesses no rivers of any importance. The Ban\u00e1s, its principal stream, rises in the Ar\u00e1valli hills, 40 miles n.w. of Udaipur (Oodeypore), and enters the District at the extreme s.e. corner, near the cantonment of Deol\u00ed. During the rains it becomes unfordable, and, as no ferries exist, travellers from Deol\u00ed can only cross into the District by means of extemporized rafts.\n\nFour other insignificant rivulets\u2014the Kh\u00e1r\u00ed Nad\u00ed, the D\u00e1i Nad\u00ed, the S\u00e1garmati, and the Saraswati\u2014swell into violent torrents after heavy rains. But the great tank embankments form the most interesting feature in the hydrography of the District. They are constructed by damming up the gorges of hill streamlets; and several of them, as for instance the Bis\u00e1lya tank, the An\u00e1s\u00e1g\u00e1r, and the Ramsar in Ajmere; the Dilw\u00e1r\u00e1, K\u00e1l\u00ednjar, Jow\u00e1j\u00e1, and B\u00e1lad in Merw\u00e1r\u00e1, date back to periods long anterior to the British occupation. As many as 435 of these valuable works now irrigate and fertilize the District, due in most part to the untiring energy and benevolent exertions of Colonel Dixon, who administered various portions of this tract from 1836 to 1857. The tanks become dry by the month of March, and their moist beds are then cultivated for the spring crops. Four small natural reservoirs, scarcely deserving the name of lakes, are also found in the depressions of the sand-hills, the most important of which is the sacred lake of Pushkar. The Ar\u00e1valli range abounds in mineral wealth, but no mining operations are at present carried on. The T\u00e1r\u00e1garh hill is rich in lead, copper, and iron, and mines have been worked. The lead mines of this hill were farmed by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s for \u00a3500 yearly. On the British acquisition of the country, Mr. Wilder, the first Superintendent of Ajmere, took the mines under direct management, and they produced annually from 400 to 500 tons of lead. The Ajmere military magazine was the chief customer, and on its ceasing to take the metal in 1846, the mines were closed. The lead is universally allowed to be purer and of a better quality than European pig-lead, and it was chiefly owing to the want of fuel, and of proper means of transport, that this\nindustry has become extinct; now that the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na State Railway is completed, there are hopes of its revival. The general character of the District is of plutonic hypogene formation, and no organic remains have yet been discovered. The hills are schistose for the most part, and a very hard dark grey granite appears to underlie the schistose strata throughout. The cultivated soil is a mixture of one-third stiff yellow loam and two-thirds sand, consisting of disintegrated mica schist and felspar. Pure silicious sand is rare. Except in the beds of the tanks, no alluvial soil is found in the District, and there is much carbonate of lime in tracts where the Euphorbi\u00e6 are most common.\n\nGood building materials abound throughout the District, and stone is largely used for purposes for which wood is employed elsewhere in India. The best stone quarries are at Sr\u00ednagar and at Sillora, not far from Ajmere. There are quarries also at At\u00edtmand and at Khet\u00e1 Khera, in the vicinity of Be\u00e1war, and at Deogarh 10 miles s.e. from Todgarh. The District was entirely denuded of trees long before the British period, but great pains have lately been taken for re-afforesting the arid hill-sides. There is not much cover for large game in the District, but leopards are found in the western hills from the N\u00e1g-pah\u00e1r down to Dawer; tigers, hy\u00e6nas, and wolves are rare. Wild pigs are preserved by most of the Th\u00e1kurs who have large estates, as pig-shooting is a favourite amusement of R\u00e1jputs. A few antelope and ravine deer are also to be seen. Of small game the bustard and florikin are occasionally met with, and geese, duck, and snipe are found in the cold weather.\n\nHistory.\u2014Tradition refers the foundation of the fort and city of Ajmere to R\u00e1j\u00e1 Aj\u00e1, a Chauh\u00e1n R\u00e1jput, about the year 145 A.D. Aja at first attempted to build his stronghold on the N\u00e1g-pah\u00e1r, where the proposed site is pointed out to the present day; but as his evil genius destroyed each night the walls erected during the day-time, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 transferred his fortress to the neighbouring hill of T\u00e1r\u00e1garh. Here he constructed a fort which he called Garh B\u00edtl\u00ed, and in the valley below, known as Indrakot, he founded a city which he called after his own name, Ajmere. Finally, toward the close of his life, he retired as a hermit to a mountain gorge, 10 miles from his newly-built capital, where the temple of Aj\u00e1p\u00e1l still commemorates his death-place. Authentic history begins, at Ajmere, with the advent of the Muhammadan conquerors. In A.D. 685, Dola R\u00e1i, Chauh\u00e1n ruler of Ajmere, joined the Hindu alliance in resisting the first isolated efforts of Musalm\u00e1n aggression under Muhammad K\u00e1sim, the Arab conqueror of Sind, but was defeated and slain by the invaders. His successor, Man\u00edk R\u00e1i, founded S\u00e1mbhar, from which the Chauh\u00e1n princes thenceforth derived their title. We hear no more of the little R\u00e1jput State till the year 1024, when Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad took the route vi\u00e2 Ajmere, in his famous expedition against the temple of Somn\u00e1th. On his way he sacked\nAjmere, and destroyed the gods and temples; but the fort of T\u00e1r\u00e1garh gave shelter to the towns-people, and Mahm\u00fad, who had no leisure for sieges, proceeded on his desolating course to Guzer\u00e1t. On his way back he had intended marching by the Ajmere route, but his guides misled him into the desert. The Ajmere R\u00e1jputs hung upon his army, inflicting severe losses, while thousands of the Muhammadans died of thirst. The guides confessed they had revenged Somn\u00e1th, and were put to death. Vis\u00e1ladeva, or Bis\u00e1ldeo, who shortly afterwards ruled at Ajmere, made himself famous by the construction of an important tank, the Bis\u00e1ls\u00e1g\u00e1r. He also conquered Delhi from the wild Tu\u00e1rs, and subdued the hill tribes of Merw\u00e1r\u00e1, whom he enslaved as drawers of water in the streets of Ajmere. An\u00e1, grandson of Bis\u00e1ldeo, constructed the embankment which forms the An\u00e1 S\u00e1g\u00e1r lake, on which Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n long afterwards erected a noble range of marble pavilions. Someswar, the third in descent from An\u00e1, married the daughter of Anang P\u00e1l Tu\u00e1r, king of Delhi; and from this marriage sprang Prithwi R\u00e1j\u00e1, the last of the Chauh\u00e1n dynasty, who was adopted by Anang P\u00e1l, and thus became ruler of Delhi and Ajmere. This marks the culminating-point in the independent history of the District. Ajmere had ranked with Delhi, Kanauj, and Ujjain, as one of the R\u00e1jput breakwaters against Muhammadan invasion. The united kingdom of Delhi and Ajmere was now submerged beneath the advancing tide, and the downfall of the inner R\u00e1jput States, Kanauj and Ujjain, followed. In 1193 A.D., Prithwi R\u00e1j\u00e1, the king of Delhi and Ajmere, was defeated and put to death in cold blood by Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn Ghori, and the Muhammadan power was thenceforth established over Upper India. Shortly afterwards, the Musalm\u00e1n leader took Ajmere, massacred such of the inhabitants as opposed him, and reserved the rest for slavery. He then granted the country to a relative of Prithwi R\u00e1j\u00e1, under a heavy tribute. In the following year, Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn overthrew the Rahtor kingdom of Kanauj, after which event the Rahtor clan emigrated to M\u00e1rw\u00e1r. The Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Ajmere did not long remain faithful to his Muhammadan suzerain. He plotted with the Rahtors and Mers to throw off his dependence on Kutab-ud-d\u00edn, the founder of the Slave dynasty at Delhi; but Kutab-ud-d\u00edn marched unexpectedly against him in the hot season, and the Ajmere R\u00e1j\u00e1 shut himself up in his fortress, and in despair threw himself and his wives on the funeral pile. The Musalm\u00e1n leader then attacked the Mers and R\u00e1jputs, and after some reverses, in the course of which he found himself in turn besieged in Ajmere, succeeded in annexing the Ar\u00e1valli country to his own dominions. Sayyid Husain received charge of the T\u00e1r\u00e1garh fort; but after the death of Kutab-ud-d\u00edn in 1210, the Rahtors and Chauh\u00e1ns joined in a night attack on T\u00e1r\u00e1garh, and massacred the garrison to a man. The shrine of Sayyid Husain still forms the most conspicuous\nobject at T\u00e1r\u00e1garh; his tomb, with those of his comrades and his celebrated charger, standing within an enclosure which bears the name of Gunj Sh\u00e1hid\u00e1n, or Treasury of Martyrs. More than three centuries later, the greatest of the Mughal sovereigns, Akbar, vowed that if a son were born to him, he would walk on foot to this shrine. His eldest son, Sal\u00edm, was born 1570, and the Emperor walked in procession to Ajmere, and offered thanks at the Martyrs\u2019 tomb. Shams-ud-d\u00edn Altamsh, the successor of Kutab-ud-d\u00edn, restored the authority of the Delhi princes, which was not again disturbed until the invasion of Tim\u00far. After the sack of Delhi by the Mughals, and the extinction of the house of Tughlak, R\u00e1n\u00e1 Kumbho of Mew\u00e1r took advantage of the prevailing anarchy to seize Ajmere; but the adventurous Hindu was soon after assassinated, and the city fell into the hands of the Muhammadan kings of M\u00e1lw\u00e1 in 1469. The M\u00e1lw\u00e1 princes retained their hold upon the tract until 1531, when their kingdom was merged in that of Guzer\u00e1t. Thereupon, M\u00e1ldeo Rahtor, prince of M\u00e1rv\u00e1r, took possession of Ajmere. He strengthened the fortress of T\u00e1r\u00e1garh, and built in part a lift to raise water from a spring at its foot; but the work, which still stands, as solid as at its first construction, was never completed. For twenty-four years the Rahtors held the District, after which period it passed under the rising power of Akbar in 1556. The great Mughal administrator included the territory in a subahat, which took its name from the town of Ajmere, and comprised the whole of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. It formed an integral portion of the Mughal empire for 194 years, from the reign of Akbar himself to that of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h. The District was an appanage of the royal residence at Ajmere, where the family of B\u00e1bar had a country-seat, to maintain their authority among the warlike R\u00e1jput chieftains of the surrounding tracts. Akbar built himself a fortified palace just outside the city. Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr and Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n often honoured it with their presence; and Sir Thomas Roe, the ambassador of James I., presented his credentials to the former Emperor at the Ajmere court, on the 23rd December 1615. Our envoy also visited a \u2018house of pleasure of the king\u2019s,\u2019 behind the T\u00e1r\u00e1garh hill, \u2018a place of much melancholy delight and security.\u2019 Ajmere formed the capital of the Mughal empire during several years of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr\u2019s reign. Thomas Coryat, the pedestrian traveller of the 17th century, or \u2018world\u2019s foot post,\u2019 as he called himself, walked from Jerusalem to Ajmere, and spent only \u00a32, 10s. od. on the road. He dated his book at Ajmere:\u2014\u2018Thomas Coryat, traveller for the English Wits, greeting. From the court of the Great Mogul at Asmere\u2019 (London, 1616). A vivid account of the court at Ajmere, of the city, and of its neighbourhood, is preserved in Sir Thomas Roe\u2019s Journal, 1615, 1616. It was at Ajmere, too, in 1659, that Aurangzeb defeated the forces of his unfortunate brother D\u00e1r\u00e1, whose flight and privations\nare graphically narrated by the traveller Bernier, an eye-witness of his miserable retreat. After the fall of the Sayyids in 1720, during the first stages of decline in the Mughal empire, Ajit Singh, of Marwar, seized on Ajmere, and murdered the imperial governor. Muhammad Shah recovered the post for a while, but ten years later he yielded it once more to Abhay Singh, who succeeded his father as ruler of Marwar. Ram Singh, son of Abhay Singh, during the course of a territorial quarrel with his uncle, called in the treacherous aid of the Marathas, under Jai Apa Sindhia. After a series of intrigues and counter-plots, whose details defy simplification, Jai Apa was murdered, and an arrangement was effected in 1756, by which Bijai Singh, a cousin and rival of Ram Singh, surrendered the suzerainty of Ajmere to the Marathas, being himself confirmed in his possession as a vassal on payment of a triennial tribute. For the next thirty-one years, the Marathas held the District; but in 1787, when Madhuj Sindhia invaded Jaipur (Jeypore), the Rahtors rose in defence of their brethren, recaptured Ajmere, and annulled their tributary engagement. Three years later, the Marathas, led by De Boigne, defeated the Rahtors at Patan, and once more occupied Ajmere, which they did not again lose till its cession to the British. After the Pindari war, Daulat Rao Sindhia made over the District of Ajmere to our Government, by treaty dated June 25, 1818. From that epoch, the history of Ajmere becomes merely administrative and social. In 1820, the tract known as Merwara was conquered and annexed; but its annals will be found under a separate heading. The long incumbency of Colonel Dixon, who took a deep interest in the welfare of the District and its people, was productive of much good to Ajmere. Tanks and other public works were vigorously pushed forward, while the fiscal arrangements were adjusted in such a manner as to encourage agriculture and develop commerce. So successful were these measures in winning the confidence of the people, that the Mutiny of 1857 left this outlying region almost unaffected. On the 28th of May, two regiments of Bengal infantry, and a battery of Bengal artillery, revolted at the military station of Nasirabad (Nusseerabad); but the European residents were protected by a regiment of Bombay infantry, while a detachment of the Merwara battalion adequately guarded the Ajmere treasury and magazine. Civil government received no interruption; the mutinous regiments marched direct to Delhi, and the agricultural classes held entirely aloof from the revolt. The great famine of 1868-69 is the only event which has since troubled the quiet annals of Ajmere-Merwara.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1872 returned the total population of Ajmere-Merwara at 316,590 souls, or 316,032 exclusive of Europeans, inhabiting an area of 2711 square miles, and distributed among 91,199 houses. The Census of 1881, the fourth of a series commencing in\n1865, returned a total population of 460,722 souls for the District, including Europeans and railway passengers; these figures show an increase of 144,132 over those of 1872; the totals for each tract, separately, being 359,288 for Ajmere and 101,434 for Merw\u00e1ra. These figures yield the following averages for the united District; for Merw\u00e1ra alone, see Merwara: Persons per square mile, 170. Classified according to sex, there were\u2014males, 248,854; females, 211,878; proportion of males in total population, 54 per cent. Classified according to age, there were\u2014adults: males, 166,136; females, 140,922: total, 307,058, or 67 per cent. of the whole population\u2014children: boys, 82,708; girls, 70,956: total, 153,664, or 33 per cent. of the whole population. The total number of houses has been returned at 86,353, of which 64,118 are given as occupied, and 22,235 as unoccupied, or 31 houses per square mile, and for the occupied houses 7 persons per house. In unoccupied houses are included shops, temples, mosques, etc. As regards the religious distinctions of the people, Ajmere-Merw\u00e1ra is still an essentially Hindu District, in spite of its long subjection to the Muhammadan power and the continued presence of the Mughal court. As many as 400,519 persons, or 87 per cent. of the population, profess some sort of Hinduism; while only 57,809, or 13 per cent., belong to the faith of Isl\u00e1m. Amongst the Hindus, 24,308 are Buddhists or Jains; 182 are Sikhs, and 376,029 are Hindus proper. The District also contains 94 Jews; 75 P\u00e1rs\u00eds; 1230 Europeans and Americans; 196 Eurasians and 799 native Christians. The agricultural population amounted to 132,702 persons. As regards the distinctions of caste or tribe, the Br\u00e1hmans numbered 22,388, of whom only 1869 live in Merw\u00e1ra, including 1082 living in Be\u00e1war town; these have no dealings with the other Br\u00e1hmans, who consider them an inferior class. The R\u00e1jputs are returned at 14,965 souls; they hold no land as cultivators, though they have large possessions under the peculiar forms of tenure known as t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r\u00ed and bh\u00fam, some account of which will be found in a later section. They are still warlike and indolent, much addicted to the use of opium, and proud of their distinguished descent from the warriors who carried the Aryan standards from their mountain home to the Eastern Sea. Every man among them carries arms, and none will touch a plough except under the extreme pressure of necessity. Amongst the various clans or sub-divisions of R\u00e1jputs, the Rahtors greatly preponderate in numbers, wealth, and power, forming the social aristocracy of Ajmere, and possessing feudal rights over a large portion of the soil. The Kachw\u00e1has come next in point of numbers. The Chauh\u00e1ns, once the dominant R\u00e1jput clan, now number only 1145. The mercantile tribes, of whom the principal are the Mahesr\u00ed Agarwal\u00e1s, Osw\u00e1ls and Saraog\u00eds, number 39,641. Of these the Osw\u00e1ls are the most notorious for good business\nhabits, general intelligence, and good humour; their females are generally taught to read and write Hindi, and many are singularly clever in keeping accounts. The J\u00e1ts and G\u00fajars comprise the original cultivators of the soil, returned at 32,690 and 31,788 souls respectively. In Ajmere, as elsewhere, the J\u00e1ts possess a fine physique and excellent agricultural qualities. They have monopolized the best villages, and display great energy in digging wells and improving their land. The G\u00fajars, on the other hand, keep up their usual character as lazy cultivators, with a greater aptitude for grazing than for tillage. The minor castes are very numerous, about one-third of the total population, but present no special interesting features. The population is generally industrious, but in a state of indebtedness, the result of extravagance in marriages, funeral feasts, and periodical famines. Though ordinarily classed as Hindus, the aboriginal tribes found in Merw\u00e1r\u00e1, known as Mers (Mhairs), are little fettered by the observances of caste, which have never been rigidly introduced among their wild gorges and jungle-clad hillsides. There is a class of Br\u00e1hmans in Merw\u00e1r\u00e1 who receive gifts and offerings from the hill-tribes, and who freely partake of meat and spirits; they have forsaken their religion, and bear no relation to the other Br\u00e1hmans. The present tendency of the Mer\u00e1ts seems to take the direction of an approach towards Isl\u00e1m. For long the Mer\u00e1ts and Mers formed a difficult problem to the English Government. Previous to our accession, they had been accustomed to live, almost destitute of clothing, by the produce of their herds, by the chase, and by plunder. But soon after the cession to us of Ajmere in 1818, the Mer country also came under British influence, and the predatory instincts of the people have at the same time been controlled and utilized by forming them into a Merw\u00e1r\u00e1 battalion. As the peaceful results of British rule developed, and the old feuds between the Mers and their R\u00e1jput neighbours died out, the Mer battalion was transformed into a police force. The men strongly objected to this change, and pleaded a long period of loyal usefulness to the State. They have accordingly been again erected into a military battalion, and brought upon the roll of the British army. The Division contains in all 735 villages and 4 towns with a population exceeding 5000 souls,\u2014namely, Ajmere (48,735), Be\u00e1war or Nay\u00e1nagar (15,829), Nas\u00edr\u00e1bd (Nusseerabad) (21,320), and Kekri (6119). Other important towns are Pisang\u00e1n (4922), Bhinae (4251), Mas\u00fada (3849), Pohkar (3392), S\u00e1war (3943), Deoli (3559). Ajmere is the head-quarters of the united Division, and Be\u00e1war of the Merw\u00e1r\u00e1 tract; Nas\u00edr\u00e1bd (Nusseerabad) forms the principal cantonment; Kekri has a declining trade, now transferred to Ajmere. The Districts include no other town of more than local importance, with the exception of Pushkar, a famous place of Hindu pilgrimage. M\u00e1rv\u00e1r\u00ed and Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed are the prevailing languages.\nAgriculture.\u2014In Ajmere-Merw\u00e1r\u00e1, as in the other parts of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, cultivation is carried on with great difficulty, owing to the insufficient and precarious nature of the water supply. Artificial irrigation is thus rendered imperatively necessary, while famines and scarcity recur with almost regular severity. The area under cultivation in the united tracts in 1880-81, was 993 square miles,\u2014Ajmere 896, Merw\u00e1r\u00e1 97,\u2014of which 51,949 acres were irrigated, and 119,467 unirrigated. The cultivable waste was 139,898 acres, uncultivable 481,099. The assessed rate per acre of cultivated land varied from 5s. 6\u00bdd. to 2s. 9d.; and of waste, from 3s. 7\u00bdd. to 1s. 4\u00bdd. The chief crops are maize, barley, jodr, and bajra. Cotton pulses, oil-seeds, wheat, and gram rank next in extent, while sugar-cane is only grown in the Pushkar valley, where it can be raised without irrigation. Poppy for opium covers a small area in Be\u00e1war and Todgarh, principally for exportation. The area occupied by each of the above is as follows: wheat, 8683 acres; other food grains, 148,350; pulses, 32,825; drugs and spices, 1333; oil-seeds, 9188; cotton, 11,694; sugar-cane, 406; miscellaneous, 2414. Water-nuts are not grown. Fish are caught in some of the lakes, but the people don\u2019t eat fish, and it is only in the An\u00e1s\u00e1g\u00e1r at Ajmere, and the sacred lake of Pushkar, that fish permanently exist, while religious prejudice prevents their being killed in the latter lake. Manure is largely used in Merw\u00e1r\u00e1, but less frequently in Ajmere Proper. Merw\u00e1r\u00e1 has also 40 per cent. of its cultivated area under irrigation, while in Ajmere the proportion so treated is only 25 per cent. The condition of the people is still far from satisfactory. They depend for their lives in times of scarcity upon the money-lending classes, who derive their capital ultimately from the Seths of Ajmere. The mortgagees of land draw more than the landlord\u2019s share from the produce of the soil, as interest upon advances. The dangerous facility of borrowing, produced by the influx of capital into the District since the introduction of British rule, has plunged all classes into debt. In the case of the larger proprietors, Government has given some relief, by liquidating the principal and collecting a moderate interest from the indebted Th\u00e1kurs; but with the peasantry, weighed down under the accumulation of hereditary indebtedness, such a system of relief would be practically impossible. Wages and prices have increased considerably of late years. In 1850 coolies received 2\u00bdd. per diem; in 1881, they obtained 6d.; in 1850, the wages for skilled labour were 6d. per diem; in 1881, they had risen to 1s. The period of daily labour has also decreased meanwhile from 10 to 8 hours. The domestic animals of the District are small and weak. The agricultural stock in 1880-81 comprised 145,131 cows and bullocks; 1124 horses; 967 ponies; 5096 donkeys; 195,257 sheep and goats; 301 camels; 3553 carts and 21,508 ploughs. The following were the prices current of food grains in 1873: Best rice, 4 sers per rupee,\nor 28s. per cwt.; common rice, 8 sers per rupee, or 14s. per cwt.; barley, 20 sers per rupee, or 5s. 7d. per cwt.; wheat, 15 sers per rupee, or 7s. 6d. per cwt. In 1881, the average prices ruling in sers of 2 lbs. in the District were for best rice, $7\\frac{1}{2}$ sers per rupee (2s.); wheat, 17 sers; \u00e1tta, $13\\frac{1}{2}$ sers; barley, 28 sers; gram, 24 sers; Indian corn, 29 sers; j\u00f3\u00e1r, 23 sers; b\u00e1jra, 19 sers; urd, 14 sers; cotton, $2\\frac{1}{4}$ sers; sugar, $2\\frac{1}{2}$ sers; ghi, $1\\frac{3}{4}$ sers; firewood, $3\\frac{1}{4}$ sers; tobacco, $1\\frac{1}{2}$ sers; salt, $11\\frac{1}{4}$ sers.\n\n**Land Tenures.** \u2014 The soil of Ajmere-Merwar\u00e1 is held on tenures analogous to those which prevail in the adjacent Native States. The territory throughout R\u00e1jput\u00e1na may be broadly divided into two classes,\u2014kh\u00e1ls\u00e1, or Crown domain; and zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri, or land originally held in barony by feudal chiefs, under obligation of military service, but now owned on a tenure known as istimr\u00e1ri. Kh\u00e1ls\u00e1 land, however, might be alienated by the Crown as endowment for a religious institution, or in j\u00e1gir as a reward of service to an individual and his heirs. Throughout all R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, the State in its kh\u00e1ls\u00e1 territory retains the actual proprietary rights, standing in the same relation to the cultivators as the feudal chiefs stand to the tenants on their estates. In j\u00e1gir lands, these rights are transferred to the j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1r. But immemorial custom in the kh\u00e1ls\u00e1 of Ajmere, allowed a cultivator who effects permanent improvements, such as sinking wells or constructing embankments, thereby to acquire certain privileges in the soil so improved. Such a cultivator was protected from ejectment by prescriptive law, so long as he paid the customary share of the produce. He might sell, mortgage, or give away the well or embankment, together with the hereditary privileges it entailed, which thus practically amounted to proprietary rights. Unirrigated land being of little value in Ajmere, the State gradually became restricted in its proprietorship to the waste or grazing lands; and since 1850 it has abandoned its claim to the ownership, and transformed the kh\u00e1ls\u00e1 villages into bh\u00e1y\u00e1ch\u00e1ra communities, owning the surrounding soil in common. This change, however, is little understood by the people, who still regard the British Government in the light of a landlord. The zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri estates are usually held on the tenure known as istimr\u00e1ri, originally a feudal holding, under obligation of military service. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, however, who would obviously have found it impolitic to encourage the warlike tendencies of their R\u00e1jput vassals, commuted for a fixed tribute the duty of furnishing a contingent to aid the suzerain power. The chieftains accordingly acquired the habit of regarding themselves as holders at a fixed and permanent quit-rent; and although, during the earlier portion of our rule, extra cesses were levied from time to time, in 1841 the British Government remitted all such collections for the future, and granted sanads to the various istimr\u00e1rd\u00e1rs, declaring their existing assessments to be fixed in perpetuity, without liability to re-settlement. A relief, however, is\nlevied on successions, its amount being separately stipulated in each sanad. Another mode of tenure, known as bh\u00fam, and confined to R\u00e1jputs, consists essentially in the possession of a hereditary inalienable title to the soil, free of revenue to the State. In return, the bh\u00fami\u00e1s bind themselves to perform certain police duties, such as guarding against dacoity or theft; and also to indemnify losses due to crimes which they ought to have prevented. This rude device for the protection of property, handed down from an earlier and a weaker Government, is already becoming obsolete; and the bh\u00fami\u00e1s have been permitted in certain cases to commute their responsibility, though still remaining liable to be called out as an armed militia, for the suppression of riots or rebellion. In Merw\u00e1r\u00e1, where no settled government existed before the British occupation, and where the people found plunder more congenial than agriculture, no revenue was ordinarily paid, and accordingly no tenures sprang up. At its first land Settlement, therefore, the British Government acted as landlord, gave leases, built tanks, and collected one-third of the produce as revenue. At the Settlement of 1851, however, all cultivators were recorded as proprietors. Speaking generally, throughout Merw\u00e1r\u00e1 a non-proprietary cultivating class can hardly be found, except on the estates of the feudal chieftains. No rent law exists; rentals are collected exclusively in kind; suits for arrears rarely occur, and suits for enhancement are unknown. Custom regulates the rates; and, as cultivators are still deficient in number, a competition for labour exists between the landlords rather than for land among the labourers.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Ajmere-Merw\u00e1r\u00e1, like the neighbouring portions of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, lies peculiarly exposed to the disasters of drought and famine. In ordinary years of scarcity, the people in the afflicted tracts emigrate to more favoured regions, returning home in time for the sowings of the succeeding year. But when both the south-western and north-eastern monsoons fail, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na is exposed, in local phraseology, to the miseries of a \u2018treble famine,\u2019 due to the lack of grain, grass, and water. Serious scarcity occurred in Ajmere-Merw\u00e1r\u00e1 in 1819, in 1824, in 1833, and in 1848. The dearth of 1861, which produced such disastrous results in the North-Western Provinces, affected only the eastern border of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na; while M\u00e1rv\u00e1r, Ajmere, and the whole tract dependent on the south-western monsoon, secured an abundant harvest. But in 1868\u201369, a treble famine of the most disastrous sort, desolated the whole of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. In Ajmere, the harvests for the four preceding years had been insufficient, and the District accordingly entered on the famine with its stock of grain exhausted. On every side, the surrounding Native States themselves suffered severely; and Ajmere stood isolated from other British Districts, in the midst of an extensive famine tract. Transport was almost impracticable, as the failure of grass rendered the\npack-cattle unable to work. Owing to the scarcity of fodder, cows were offered for sale at 2s. a head in August 1868. At the same time, wheat sold for 10 sers per rupee, or 11s. 2d. per cwt.; and barley, jo\u00e1r, and grass at 12 sers per rupee, or 9s. 4d. per cwt. Relief works were set on foot; emigration went on uninterruptedly; while, on the other hand, crowds of starving poor poured into the District from M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, accompanied by their herds, which consumed the little grass still remaining. Early in 1869, although poor-houses were established, the people were reduced to support themselves upon the bark of trees and roots. The kharif harvest of 1869 proved a partial failure, and the distress became terrible. Food could not be procured at any price. Before the close of the famine, it was calculated that 105,000 persons, or 25 per cent., had perished, besides 33 per cent. of the cattle. Government had expended altogether \u00a3152,007, of which sum \u00a323,000 were gratuitously distributed. The famine left the District thoroughly impoverished, and deeply indebted, nor can its prosperity be expected to revive before the lapse of many years. It is hoped, however, that the opening of the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na State Railway, which has relieved Ajmere-Merw\u00e1r\u00e1 from its previous isolation, will prevent the recurrence of so severe a visitation, by affording a means of access to the rich grain stores of the Do\u00e1b. A tendency to the equalisation of prices has already disclosed itself.\n\nForests.\u2014Forest conservancy, so long neglected in this District, is now making steady progress. The total area of reserved forests in 1880-81, was returned at 77,875 acres, or 121.6 square miles. There were also 35 acres appropriated for nurseries and plantation operations. The following is the list of tracts reserved: in Ajmere, Madar Hill, 2812 acres; N\u00e1g-pah\u00e1r, 2660 acres; T\u00e1r\u00e1garh valleys, 1016 acres; Sr\u00ednagar and Bir, 3575 acres; Raja\u00f3s\u00ed, 1260 acres; and D\u00e1nta, 1244 acres. In Merw\u00e1ra: Chang, 2341 acres; Hattun and Sheopura, 1920 acres; Biliaw\u00e1s and T\u00e1r\u00e1garh, 3172 acres; Todgarh and Bar\u00e1kh\u00e1n, 40,048 acres; Dilw\u00e1r\u00e1 and Chang Birs, 235 acres; Borwar and Kotra, 3923 acres; Auspah\u00e1r, 1466 acres; and Dewair, 12,203 acres. The total expenditure on plantations down to 1880-81 was \u00a33463. For the year the expenditure was \u00a31242, and the income \u00a3112.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The city of Ajmere was in ancient times an entrep\u00f4t for the trade between Bombay and Upper India, and a factory was early established by the East India Company at this important centre. The District forms the natural mart for the interchange of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na produce with European goods or Upper Indian and Bombay wares. The trade of Ajmere city was for some years on the decline, but the railway has largely revived its importance, while Be\u00e1war (or Nay\u00e1nagar) and Nas\u00edr\u00e1b\u00e1d (Nusseerabad) have lately made rapid progress. The chief imports consist of sugar and European cloth; the\nprincipal exports comprise cotton, for which Be\u00e1war forms the great local mart, grain and poppy seeds, which are despatched to P\u00e1li in M\u00e1rv\u00e1r. The District has no manufactures except a few salt-pans. Till quite lately, the transit trade was entirely carried on by camels and bullocks, but these have now been largely superseded by the railway. Communications have rapidly improved of late years. The famine of 1869 gave a great stimulus to the construction of metalled roads, of which the District now possesses several, the principal among them connecting Ajmere city with Agra, N\u00edmach (Neemuch) and Mhau (Mhow), and Nas\u00edr\u00e1bd (Nusseerabad) with Deol\u00ed. Merw\u00e1r\u00e1 had hardly any roads before the famine, but a good track now runs to Todgarh, and two others lead over the passes into Mas\u00fada and Meyw\u00e1r. The length of metalled roads is 226 miles, unmetalled 365 miles. The R\u00e1jput\u00e1na State Railway connects the town of Ajmere with Agra, Nas\u00edr\u00e1bd (Nusseerabad), and Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, in Bombay; while the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na-M\u00e1lw\u00e1 line connects Ajmere and Nas\u00edr\u00e1bd (Nusseerabad) with the Khandw\u00e1 station of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. The local traffic over these lines far exceeds any expectations that had been formed, and the effect in cheapening many commodities at Ajmere has been considerable. Ajmere is now connected with three great main lines: with the East India Railway at Agra; the Bombay Baroda Railway at Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d; and the Great Indian Peninsula Railway at Khandw\u00e1.\n\nAdministration.\u2014Ajmere-Merw\u00e1r\u00e1 forms a Division under a Commissioner, whose head-quarters are at Ajmere city. The Commissioner has the powers of a Civil and Sessions Judge, and has direct management of the Police, Registration, Jail, and Education affairs. The Ajmere District is administered by an Assistant Commissioner, who has his head-quarters also at Ajmere; and Merw\u00e1r\u00e1 is administered by an Assistant-Commissioner, whose head-quarters are at Be\u00e1war, 33 miles distant from Ajmere. The united Division forms also a Chief Commissionership under the Foreign Department; the Governor-General's Agent for R\u00e1jput\u00e1na being ex officio Chief Commissioner of Ajmere-Merw\u00e1r\u00e1, having the powers of a chief revenue authority and of the highest court of appeal in civil and criminal cases. The Chief Commissioner is assisted in the administration of the Division by 43 officers invested with various magisterial powers. The total revenue, imperial, local, and municipal, raised in the Division during the year 1880\u201381 amounted to \u00a3121,062, and the total expenditure to \u00a370,398. The imperial receipts were returned at \u00a394,602, of which \u00a338,235 were due to the land tax. The other principal items of receipt were stamps, excise, and fees in law courts. The total strength of the police force during the same year was 582 men of all grades, being in the proportion of one policeman to every 4'65 square miles, and every 792 of\nthe population. The cost of maintenance amounted to \u00a39044, or \u00a33, 6s. 9d. per square mile, and 6\u00bdd. per head of the population. The whole number of crimes reported to have been committed in the united Division, during the same year, was 2184, being at the rate of one crime to every 1'24 square mile of area, and every 211 of the population. The Division contains but one place of confinement for criminals, which is also the central jail for the whole of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, receiving prisoners from all the Political and Criminal Courts throughout the Province. During the year 1880, it contained 1109 convicts, of whom 1035 were males and 74 females. The daily average number of inmates was 463. The average annual cost per head amounted to \u00a33, 18s. 3d., and the average earnings of each prisoner to \u00a33, 7s. 6\u00bdd.\n\nThe receipts by sale of jail manufactures in 1880 amounted to \u00a31005, the expenditure for materials amounted to \u00a3628, showing a net amount to credit of \u00a3377. The total expenditure on the prison for the year amounted to \u00a32272. Education still remains in a backward state, when compared with other portions of Northern India. In 1880-81 the Division possessed a total number of 139 schools, with a joint roll of 5417 pupils. The United Presbyterian Mission has 6 stations in Ajmere, and maintains 60 schools, with a total of 1989 pupils. The Ajmere College, opened in 1851, was affiliated to the Calcutta University ten years later, and contained 211 students in 1881. The Mayo College, set on foot by the late Earl of Mayo, on the occasion of his visit to R\u00e1jput\u00e1na in 1870, is supported partly by the interest on a sum of nearly 7 l\u0101khs of rupees (\u00a370,000), contributed by the native chiefs, and partly by an annual allowance from Government. It is intended as a purely aristocratic College for the whole of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, where the sons of R\u00e1jput noblemen may be brought into direct contact with European ideas, under healthy influences of physical and moral training. The College has been carried on since 1875, and its first Principal was Major St. John of the Royal Engineers. The council or governing body of the College consists of all the principal chiefs of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, and the Political Agents accredited to their States, with the Viceroy as President, and the Agent to the Governor-General in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na as Vice-President. The Division contains three municipalities, Ajmere, Be\u00e1war, and Kekri. In 1880-81 their joint revenue amounted to \u00a311,230, the greater part of which was derived from an octroi duty. The incidence of municipal taxation was at the rate of 2s. 6\u00bdd. per head of their united population.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014Ajmere-Merw\u00e1ra lies on the watershed of the continent, and on the border of the arid zone of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, outside the full influence of the two monsoons, from whose spent and wasted force it derives a partial and precarious rainfall, varying much in quantity from year to year. The average annual amount for the\nnineteen years ending 1881, was 22.56 inches at Ajmere, and (for 26 years to 1881) 20.64 inches at Beawar. The maximum at the two stations during this period was 43.40 inches in 1862, and the minimum was 5.50 in 1868, the year of the great famine. The rainfall in 1881 was returned at 21.21 inches for Ajmere, and 20.60 for Beawar. The climate is healthy; with cold, bracing weather in December, January, and February, when hoar-frost not infrequently covers the ground in the early morning. The mean monthly temperature in the shade showed 90.5\u00b0 F. in May, 87.1\u00b0 in July, and 73.0\u00b0 in December 1875. The maximum reading was 112\u00b0 in May, and the minimum 62.0\u00b0 in December. The District suffers from no special endemic disease, except fever in Ajmere city; but epidemics of cholera frequently occur, while dysentery, skin diseases, and pleurisy cause many deaths. Ophthalmia is common, and guinea-worm sometimes attacks hundreds of people in a single year. The annual death-rate per 1000 of the total population was returned in 1880-81 at 34.4. The District contained seven charitable dispensaries in 1875, which afforded relief to 24,575 persons, of whom 454 were in-door patients. The lunatic asylum had 19 inmates during the same year, 11 of whom were discharged as cured.\u2014[For further information, see Rajputana Gazetteer, 1879; Gazetteer of Ajmere-Merwara, by Mr. J. D. Latouche, C.S., 1875; Provincial Administration Reports, 1880-81 and 1881-82; Census Report, 1881; Departmental Reports, 1880-81 and 1881-82.]\n\nAjmere.\u2014City and administrative head-quarters of Ajmere-Merwara Division, Rajputana. Lat. 26\u00b0 27' 10\" N., long. 74\u00b0 43' 58\" E. Population in 1881, 48,735, namely, males, 27,347, and females, 21,388. Hindus numbered 26,685; Muhammadans, 18,702; Jains, 2575; Christians, 720; Parsis, 22; Jews, 21; and Sikhs, 10. Distant from Bombay 677 miles north; from Agra, 228 miles west. Occupies the lower slope of the Taragarh hill, crowned by the lofty fortress of Taragarh; on the north side lies the Anasagar lake. A stone wall, with five gateways, surrounds the city, which has well-built, open streets, containing many fine houses. Founded, according to tradition, by the eponymous Raja Ajai, in the year 145 A.D. Underwent many dynastic changes during the Middle Ages. A full account of its history will be found under Ajmere-Merwara. Akbar built a fortified palace just outside the walls, where Jahangir and Shah Jahangir often resided. Sir Thomas Roe, the ambassador of James I of England, visited the city in December 1615, and presented his credentials to Jahangir. His journals present a vivid picture of Court life at Ajmere in 1615 and 1616. In 1791, the fort underwent a siege by the Marathas under De Boigne, who captured the city on the 22nd August. The original town, known as Indrakot, stood in the valley through which the road leads to Taragarh; here a number of Musalmans families\nstill reside. Among the objects of interest in or near the city, the most noticeable is the Dargah, an object of veneration alike to Muhammadans and Hindus. It marks the burial-place of the saint, Khw\u00e1ja Muezzin-ud-d\u00edn-Chishti, more briefly known as Khw\u00e1ja S\u00e1hib, who came to Ajmere in the year 1235, shortly before the invasion of Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn. He succeeded in converting many of the inhabitants, and worked several miracles, whose memory is handed down in numerous legends. His eldest lineal descendant still ranks as spiritual head of the shrine. The Dargah lies on the southern side of the city, and comprises, amongst other buildings, a partially ruined mosque, erected by Akbar; another mosque of white marble, the gift of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, still in perfect repair; and the tomb of the Khw\u00e1ja himself, a square-domed edifice with two entrances, one of which is spanned by a silver arch. A festival called Urs Mel\u00e1, of six days' duration, is held annually at the Dargah. One peculiar custom of this festival may be mentioned. There are two large cauldrons inside the Dargah enclosure, one twice the size of the other; these are known as the great and little deg. Pilgrims to the shrine propose to offer a deg feast. The smallest sum with which to buy the rice, butter, sugar, almonds, raisins, and spices to fill the large deg is \u00a3100; the donor, besides the actual cost of its contents, has to pay about \u00a320 more as presents to the officials of the shrine, and as offerings at the tomb. The materials for the small deg cost exactly half the sum required for the large one. After this gigantic rice pudding has been cooked, it is scrambled for, boiling hot. Eight earthen pots of the mixture are first set apart for the foreign pilgrims, and it is the hereditary privilege of the people of Indrakot, and of the menials of the Dargah, to empty the cauldron of the remainder of its contents. All the men who take part in this hereditary privilege are swaddled up to the eyes in cloths, to avoid the effect of the scalding fluid. When the cauldron is nearly empty, all the Indrakotis tumble in together and scrape it clean. There is no doubt that this custom is very ancient, though no account of its origin can be given. It is generally counted among the miracles of the saint, that no lives have ever been lost on these occasions, though burns are frequent. The cooked rice is bought by all classes, and most castes will eat it. The number of pilgrims at this festival is estimated at 20,000. The Arhai-din-ka-jhonpra (shed of two and a half days), a mosque situated on the lower slope of the T\u00e1r\u00e1garh hill, originally formed a Jain temple, but was converted into a place of Muhammadan worship (A.D. 1236) by Altamsh or Kutab-ud-d\u00edn, in two and a half days, according to tradition. It ranks as the finest specimen of early Muhammadan architecture now extant; but its gorgeous prodigality of ornament, and delicately-finished detail, are referred by General Cunningham to the earlier Hindu workmen, whose handicraft has been incorporated in the Musalm\u00e1n\nbuilding. Government has lately undertaken to repair this magnificent relic, which had long exhibited signs of decay and insecurity. The Daulat B\u0101gh, or Garden of Splendour, built in the 16th century over the An\u00e1 S\u00e1gar lake by Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, now serves as the abode of the Chief Commissioner. Elegant marble pavilions, commanding a full view of the town, stand on the very edge of the lake, in which, as in a crystal mirror, the surrounding hills are reflected. The garden itself is of great extent, and full of venerable trees. Akbar's massive, square, fortified palace, on the north side of the city, served for some years as an arsenal for the British military authorities, but now does duty as a tahs\u012bl and treasury. Ajmere derives its water-supply from the An\u00e1 S\u00e1gar tank, by two masonry channels passing underground, with openings at intervals. One channel passes through the city, the other just outside it; the latter fills a handsome reservoir called the Mad\u00e1r Kund. Two natural springs, known as the Jh\u00e1lra and the Diggi, are also largely resorted to for water. There are very few good wells about the town, and there are none within the walls. The transport trade of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na centres in the city, and has largely increased since the opening of the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na State Railway. Several important firms of Seths have their head offices in Ajmere, with branches throughout R\u00e1jput\u00e1na and other parts of India. They act chiefly as bankers and money-lenders, transacting a large business with the Native States.\n\nThe city contains two institutions for higher education, the Ajmere and the Mayo Colleges, details of which are given under the heading of AJMERE-MERWARA DISTRICT. It also includes a jail, dispensary, post-office, and telegraph station. The head-quarters of the Merw\u00e1r\u00e1 Battalion were transferred to Ajmere in 1871. Municipal income in 1880\u201381, \u00a36576, or 2s. 1d. per head of population within municipal limits.

Lat. 26\u00b0 48\u2032 20\u2033 N., long. 82\u00b0 14\u2032 40\u2033 E. The interest of Ajodhya centres in its ancient history. In the present day, the old city has almost entirely disappeared, and its site is only known by heaps of ruins. But in remote antiquity, Ajodhya was one of the largest and most magnificent of Indian cities. It is said to have covered an area of 12 yojan, equal to 96 miles, and was the capital of the kingdom of Kosala (corresponding to the modern Oudh), and the court of the great King Dasaratha, the fifty-sixth monarch of the Solar line in descent from R\u00e1j\u00e1 Manu. The opening chapters of the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana recount the magnificence of the city, the glories of the monarch, and the virtues, wealth, and loyalty of his people. Dasaratha was the father of R\u00e1ma Chandra, the hero of the epic. With the fall of the last of the Solar line, R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sumintra, the one hundred and thirteenth monarch, Ajodhya became a wilderness, and the royal families dispersed. From different members of this scattered people, the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Jaipur, Udaipur, Jamber, etc., claim descent. A period of Buddhist supremacy followed the death of the last king of the Solar dynasty. On the revival of Br\u00e1hmanism Ajodhya was restored by King Vikram\u00e1ditya (circa 57 A.D.). He is said to have traced out the ancient city, and identified the different shrines and spots rendered sacred by association with events in the life of R\u00e1ma, the deified son of Dasaratha. The most important of these are the R\u00e1mkot, or fort and palace of the king, the Nageswar N\u00e1th shrine, sacred to Mah\u00e1deo, the Maniparbat or sacred mound, and a few temples still visited by thousands of pilgrims. After Vikram\u00e1ditya, the kingdom of Kosala, with Ajodhya as its capital, was ruled successively by the Sam\u00fadra P\u00e1l, Sr\u00edbastam, and Kanauj dynasties, until the period of the Muhammadan conquest. Kosala is also famous as the early home of Buddhism and of its modern representative, Jainism, and claims to be the birthplace of the founder of both these faiths. The Chinese traveller, Hwen Thsang, in the 7th century, found twenty Buddhist temples, with 3000 monks, at Ajodhya, among a large Br\u00e1hmanical population. Many Jain temples exist, but are of modern restoration. Other more recent temples (dating from about 150 years back) mark the supposed birthplaces of five of the principal hierarchs of the faith. The Muhammadan conquest has left behind it the ruins of three mosques, erected by the Emperors B\u00e1bar\nand Aurangzeb, on or near the site, and out of the materials, of three celebrated Hindu shrines known as (1) the Janmasth\u00e1n, marking the place where R\u00e1ma was born; (2) the Swarga-dw\u00e1ra mandir, on the spot where his body is said to have been burned; and (3) the Taret\u00e1-k\u00e1-Th\u00e1kur, famous as the scene of one of his great sacrifices. The modern town of Ajodhya (1881) contains 2545 houses, 864 being of masonry. Population 11,643, of whom 9499 are Hindus, 2141 Muhammadans, and 3 \u2018others.\u2019 There are 96 Hindu temples, of which 63 are Vishnuvite and 33 Sivaite; 36 Musalm\u00e1n mosques. Principal buildings\u2014Darshan Singh\u2019s or M\u00e1n Singh\u2019s temple, erected about 30 years ago, and the Hanum\u00e1n Garhi. Little local trade is carried on; but the great fair of R\u00e1m\u00e1n\u00ed held here every year is attended by about 500,000 people. [For further information, see The Oudh Gazetteer (1877). The article AJODHYA was contributed by Mr. P. Carnegy, Commissioner of Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d.]\n\nAjodhya.\u2014A considerable trading village in Bardw\u00e1n District, Bengal.

Lat. 16\u00b0 8' N., long. 74\u00b0 17' E. The chief is a feudatory of Kolh\u00e1pur.\n\nAka Hills.\u2014Tract of country on the north-east frontier of India, occupied by an independent tribe called Aka. It lies north of Darrang District, Assam, bounded east by the Daphl\u00e1 Hills, and west by independent Bh\u00fat\u00eda tribes. The following brief account of this tribe is mainly condensed from Colonel E. T. Dalton\u2019s Descriptive Ethnology of Bengal (Calcutta, 1872). The Akas call themselves Hrusso, and are divided into two clans\u2014the Haz\u00e1r\u00ed-khoas, or \u2018eaters of a thousand hearths;\u2019 and the Kap\u00e1s-chors, or \u2018thieves that lurk in the cotton fields.\u2019 These are both Assamese nicknames, indicating the terror inspired in former days by their raids into the Brahmaputra valley. The Aka country is very difficult of access, the direct road from the plains leading along the precipitous channel of the Bhoroli river, which divides the Aka from the Daphl\u00e1 country. Farther north lies the country of the Mig\u00eds, a kindred clan, with whom the Akas intermarry, but who rarely visit the plains except to support the Akas in mischief. Under the native Government of Assam, the Haz\u00e1r\u00ed-khoas had acquired a right to levy black mail on the people of the plains, which they regularly enforced; and hence probably their name. The Kap\u00e1s-chors exercised the right without having obtained a licence; and one of their chiefs, the T\u00e1gi R\u00e1j\u00e1, mercilessly plundered the people till he was captured in 1829, and confined a close prisoner in the Gauh\u00e1ti jail. After an imprisonment of four years he was released, but his first action on reaching his native hills after obtaining his freedom was to put to death all who had been concerned\nin his capture. He afterwards attacked and cut up a British outpost stationed at the head of the pass leading into his country. During the next seven years, although vigorously pursued, he not only evaded capture, but made fresh raids on the plains. At length he and his subordinate chiefs surrendered; and upon their taking a solemn oath to respect the peace of the frontier, they were amnestied, and small pensions were allotted to them. In 1873, a small piece of land in the plains, 49 acres in extent, was granted to the Haz\u00e1ri-khoa clan. The Kap\u00e1s-chor Akas subsequently received a similar grant of land of the same extent as the Haz\u00e1ri-khoas, under the orders of the Chief Commissioner. In 1875\u201376, the boundary between the Kap\u00e1s-chors and Darrang District was demarcated by the Deputy-Commissioner. This clan, a few years ago, adopted a degraded form of Hinduism, together with the worship of the god Hari. But the tribal gods are F\u00faxo, the god of the mountains and streams; Fir\u00e1n and Siman, the gods of war; and Satu, the god of house and field; to all of whom propitiatory offerings are made at stated seasons, with thanksgiving sacrifices on the birth of children. The Aka houses are similar to those of the Mir\u00eds, but are more carefully and substantially built, with a well smoothed and closely fitting plank floor, raised on piles. All the household utensils are of metal. Large copper vases for water are obtained from Tibet and Bh\u00fat\u00e1n, and cooking pots and plates of brass from Assam, whence they also purchase iron and steel for making arms. A few possess muskets, but their chief weapons are the crossbow and poisoned arrows, a light spear, and a sword about four feet long. They are a brave people, and the men strong and well made. They are disliked and feared by their eastern neighbours, the Daphl\u00e1is, with whom they have very little communication. Since the foregoing article was written, the Akas have again given trouble. Towards the end of 1883 they showed their old turbulent spirit. The reservation of a tract of country in the north of Darrang District as Government forest was resented by the tribe, who claimed it as their own land. They made a sudden descent upon the plains at B\u00e1lipar\u00e1 in Darrang, within a few miles of Tezpur, the head-quarters of the District, and left behind them some imperious demands upon the Deputy Commissioner. They then carried off several native forest officers as hostages. Their refusal to return their captives led to an expedition being sent against them. The expeditionary force, under the command of General Sale Hill, C.B., started in December 1883, and returned to Tezpur on the 1st February 1884. All its objects were satisfactorily accomplished, namely, the recovery of the captives, the surrender of all fire-arms, the payment of the fine inflicted by the British Government, the complete submission of the tribe, and the survey of the country.\n\nAk\u00e1lgarh (or Al\u00edgarh, as called by Muhammadans).\u2014Town in\nWazir\u00e1b\u00e1d tahsil, of Gujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la District, Punjab. Lat. 32\u00b0 16' N., long. 73\u00b0 52' 0\" E. Pop. (1881) 4312, comprising 2329 Muhamma-\ndans, 1846 Hindus, 136 Sikhs, and 1 'other.' Third-class munici-\npality; income in 1880-81, \u00a3160, derived from octroi; expenditure,\n\u00a3148; incidence of municipal taxation, 8\u00bdd. per head. First-class\npolice station and post-office. The town is of no commercial impor-\ntance, and its best claim to note lies in its being the residence of a\nfamily of Kshattriyas of the Chopra caste, to which belonged the\ncelebrated Diw\u00e1n S\u00e1wan Mall and his son M\u00falr\u00e1j, Governors of\nM\u00falt\u00e1n in the latter days of Sikh rule.\n\nAkalgarh.\u2014Town in Karmgarh tahsil, Pati\u00e1la State, Punjab.\nPopulation (1881) 2907; namely, Hindus, 1465; Sikhs, 265; Jains,\n33; and Muhammadans, 1144; number of houses, 485.\n\nAkalkot.\u2014Feudatory State, one of the old Sat\u00e1ra J\u00e1girs, or of the\nDeccan J\u00e1girs, according to modern nomenclature, Bombay Presi-\ndency; lying between lat. 17\u00b0 17' 45\" and 17\u00b0 44' N., and long. 75\u00b0 56'\nand 76\u00b0 28' 30\" E. Bounded on the north, east, and south, by the\nNiz\u00e1m's Dominions, and on the west by the British District of Shol\u00e1pur.\nArea, 498 square miles; 104 villages. Population in 1881, 58,040, or\n116 persons to the square mile. Gross revenue in 1880-81, \u00a334,343.\nExpenditure, \u00a334,577. Akalkot forms part of the table-land of the\nDeccan. The country is open, undulating, and remarkably free from\ntracts of waste or forest land, and is intersected by the Great Indian\nPeninsula Railway. A few streams cross the State, but they are all\nsmall; the Bori, the largest, being nearly dry during the greater part\nof the year. The climate is comparatively cool and agreeable, with an\naverage rainfall of 30 inches during the six years ending with 1872.\nThe registered rainfall in 1881 was 30\u00b741 inches. Fever, rheumatism,\ndiarrh\u0153a, and dysentery, are the most prevalent complaints. Within\nthe limits of the State there are neither mines nor forests. The chief\nagricultural products are Indian millet (Holcus sorghum), rice, sugar-\ncane, gram, wheat, and linseed. Of the total population, 49,971 are\nHindus, 7590 Muhammadans, and 479 belong to other religions. A\nsurvey of this State, completed in 1871, shows that (exclusive of\nalienated villages) 271,259 acres are cultivable, and 24,313 uncultivable.\nThe cultivable State lands have been assessed at an average rate\nof 1s. 8d. per acre, yielding a total yearly income of \u00a323,760. The\nchief occupation of the inhabitants is agriculture, supporting 35\u00b714 per\ncent. of the population. The only other industry of any importance is\nthe weaving of cotton cloth, turbans, and women's robes, a calling that\ngives employment to about six hundred families.\n\nIn the beginning of the 18th century, the Akalkot territory, which\nhad formerly been part of the Musalm\u00e1n kingdom of Ahmadnagar, was\nsubject to the supply of a contingent of horse granted by S\u00e1hu, the\nruler of Sat\u00e1ra, to a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 officer, the ancestor of the present chief. On the British annexation of Sat\u00e1ra in 1849, the Akalkot chief became a feudatory of the British Government. In 1868, the contingent of horse was disbanded, and a yearly money payment of \u00a31459 was substituted. The family follows the rule of primogeniture, and holds a charter (sanad) authorizing adoption. The State does not maintain any military force; the regular police number 59. In 1866, on account of his misrule, the Chief was deposed, and the State placed under the management of the British Government until his death in 1870. During the minority of the heir, a Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 by caste (who, at the time of his accession, was a child of two years of age), the territory is managed by the Collector of Shol\u00e1pur, who is also styled \u2018Political Superintendent, Akalkot,\u2019 and whose office is known as the Shol\u00e1pur Agency. The Chief is a first-class Sard\u00e1r of the Deccan; he was educated at the R\u00e1jar\u00e1m College at Kolh\u00e1pur. A portion of the funds of the State are yearly set apart for the construction of public works; a dispensary has been established at the town of Akalkot. There are 19 schools in the State, attended by 619 pupils.\n\n**Akalkot.**\u2014Chief town of the State of Akalkot, in political connection with the Bombay Presidency.

Bounded on the north by the S\u00e1tputra Hills; on the south by the S\u00e1tm\u00e1l\u00e1, or Ajanta range, which separates it from B\u00e1sim and Buld\u00e1n\u00e1 Districts; on the east by Ellichpur and Amr\u00e1oti Districts, and on the west by Buld\u00e1n\u00e1 and Kh\u00e1ndesh Districts. Area, 2660 square miles. Greatest length north and south, 72 miles; greatest breadth east and west, 63 miles. Number of villages on the Government rent-roll, 1194; and of revenue sub-divisions 5. Land revenue, \u00a3178,810; total revenue (gross), \u00a3238,785 (1881). Population, according to the census of 1881, 592,792, or 223 per square mile of area. The town of Akola, on the river Morn\u00e1, is the administrative head-quarters of the District, and of the Judicial Commissionership of Ber\u00e1r. The District is sub-divided for fiscal purposes into 5 t\u00e1luk, viz. Akola, Akot, Balapur, Jalgaon, and Khamgaon.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District is almost a dead level. The Purna, a non-navigable river, forms the main line of drainage, and receives seven tributaries in its westward course through the District, which it divides into two almost equal parts. Two conical-shaped hills, one in the south of the B\u00e1l\u00e1pur t\u00e1luk, the other in the Akola t\u00e1luk, rise abruptly from the plain. The soil is for the most part a rich black alluvial mould. Forest reserves, 88 square miles, chiefly plantations of\nBabul (Mimosa arabica) for supply of fuel and small timber. In the coverts bordering the hills, panthers, hyenas, wolves, black bears, and wild hog are found. The increase of cultivation under British administration has driven away the tiger, which is now rarely seen. Antelope, sambhar, bustard, florican, pea-fowl, duck, teal, partridge, and quail are met with in plenty, while the rivers abound in fish.\n\nThe District antiquities are few. At P\u00e1t\u00far there is a temple cut out of the solid rock. Several temples built of dressed stone without cement are also found; the finest of these are at Pinjar and B\u00e1rsi T\u00e1kli. The Chhatri or pavilion of black stone, supposed to have been built by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Jai Singh, the R\u00e1jput prince, who was one of Aurangzeb\u2019s best generals, may still be seen at Balapur. There are 19 Dargahs (saints\u2019 tombs); of these the most noteworthy is that of P\u00edr N\u00e1mad Aulia Ambia at Dharur, who is said to have led the forlorn hope at the storming of Narnala, when besieged by the Delhi Emperor. At Sh\u00e1hpur, near B\u00e1l\u00e1pur, are ruins of the palace built by Prince Mur\u00e1d Sh\u00e1h, son of Akbar, who commanded in this Province, and died here in 1599 A.D. Of modern Hindu temples there are 169 in all, and 56 masjids or mosques of varying antiquity. The salt wells are the most curious mineral speciality of this District. They are sunk into what is supposed to be \u2018a kind of subterranean lake or reservoir of water,\u2019 extending more than fifty miles in length, and about ten in breadth, on both sides of the Purna river, from the village of P\u00e1t\u00farda on the west, into Amr\u00e1oti District on the east, the principal wells being close to Dahihanda; the water in this underground lake is supposed to be very deep, but it has never been properly fathomed. The diameter of the shafts is 3 or 4 feet, and their inner surface is lined with basket-work; at 90 to 120 feet, a thick and strong band of gritstone is met with, through which, when pierced, water rushes violently up 15 or 20 feet. The salt is produced by natural evaporation of the water, which is drawn up and exposed in salt-pans; it contains deliquescent salts, which give it a bitter taste, and spoil it for exportation. The supply of salt from these wells is inexhaustible, but the wells are no longer allowed to be worked.\n\nHistory.\u2014Local tradition preserves the memory of independent R\u00e1j\u00e1s who governed from Ellichpur, and asserts that the princes preceding the Muhammadans were Jains. The tract now forming Akola District, was presumably included in the territory acquired by Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn in 1294, in his first expedition to the Deccan. At his death, the Hindus reasserted their independence, but were crushed, and their last R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Deogarh was flayed alive in 1319, from which date Ber\u00e1r became permanently subject to Muhammadan rule. The B\u00e1hmani dynasty, with the Im\u00e1d Sh\u00e1h\u00ed rulers, and the Ahmadnagar princes, held sway in succession until 1594\u201396, when the Emperor Akbar\nannexed Ber\u00e1r, and formed it into an imperial Province. His son, Prince Mur\u00e1d Mirz\u00e1, built a palace for himself in Akola District in 1596; and the District was included in Sark\u00e1r Narn\u00e1la. On the death of Akbar, M\u00e1lik Ambar, an Abyssinian, recovered part of Ber\u00e1r, and in 1612 fixed a standard rent-roll, the memory of which still survives. But his influence was short-lived; and from 1596, Akola practically remained a province of the Mughal empire. Its revenue system, as organized by Todar Mall, was introduced about 1637\u201338, from which year the Fasli era runs in this District. In 1671, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1, Prat\u00e1p R\u00e1o, Sivaji\u2019s general, plundered as far east as K\u00e1ranja (in Amr\u00e1oti District), and exacted a pledge from the village officers to pay chauth. In 1717, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s obtained formal grants from the Ministers of the Emperor Farrukhsiyyar. But in 1724, Chinkhilich Kh\u00e1n, Viceroy of the Deccan, under the title of Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk, obtained a decisive victory over Farrukhsiyyar\u2019s party. Since this date, Ber\u00e1r has been reckoned a dependency of the Niz\u00e1m\u00e1t at Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyderabad). But throughout the 18th century, a long struggle went on between the Niz\u00e1m and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, for the revenues of the Province. By the battle of Argaum, a village 36 miles north of Akola, General Wellesley broke the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 power under Raghuji Bhonsla; and the District, as a section of Ber\u00e1r, was in part formally made over to the Niz\u00e1m in 1804, the remainder being transferred at the conclusion of the Pind\u00e1ri war. The exactions of the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s revenue officers led to frequent outbreaks. In 1841, Mogat R\u00e1o planted the flag of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 Bhonslas on the walls of J\u00e1mod, in the north of Akola District. More serious disturbances took place in 1849 under Ap\u00e1 S\u00e1hib, and were only put down by British troops. Akola was one of the Districts assigned by the Niz\u00e1m to the British, for the maintenance of the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyderabad) contingent, under the treaties of 1853 and 1861.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The District population, as ascertained by the Census of 1867, was 460,615. A later return (1876\u201377), based, however, only on estimates, shows a population of 523,913 on an area of 2660 square miles, being 196 per square mile. No Census of the District was taken in 1872. The Census of 1881 gave the total population at 592,792, or 222\u00b78 persons per square mile. Adult males numbered 204,524; adult females, 183,392; male children under twelve, 103,522; female children under twelve, 101,354. Total males, 308,046; total females, 284,746; grand total, 592,792. Classified according to religion, the Hindus numbered 539,068; Muhammadans, 49,337; aborigines, 59; Jains, 3736; Sikhs, 93; Europeans, 74; Eurasians, 165; native Christians, 149; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 108; and Jews, 3. The Census Report returned the aboriginal tribes at only 59, according to religious classification; according to race, they number 7160. The great majority have now abandoned their primitive faiths and adopted some form of Hinduism,\nwhile some have been converted to Christianity. The distribution of the Hindus by caste showed 18,632 Br\u00e1hmans; 10,922 R\u00e1jputs; 207,253 Kunb\u00eds; 53,421 M\u00e1lis; 66,781 Mahars; and 178,694 other Hindu castes. Most of the Hindus are of low class, and some, as the P\u00e1s\u00eds, lead a wandering life. The Kunb\u00eds (Hindu cultivators) worship and pay vows at Muhammadan shrines, whose custodians (Muj\u00e1wars) officiate at ceremonies forbidden by the Kor\u00e1n. Among the Muhammadans there were 1411 Sayads; 560 Mughals; 9749 Path\u00e1ns; 32,413 Sheikhs; and 5204 others. The Musalm\u00e1ns consult the Hindu Joshi, a priest astrologer, for auspicious days. The M\u00e1nbhavs, a Hindu sect bound to, but not rigidly observing celibacy, number 812 in Akola District. A new sect, acknowledging no tie but that of absolute dependence on and service to the sacred t\u00falsi plant (Ocymum sanctum), sprang up in 1860\u201370. No castes are excluded, and a Br\u00e1hman belonging to it must offer obeisance to the M\u00e1l or necklace of T\u00falsi root beads, worn by an outcast Dher. The patw\u00e1ri-ship of Mauza Agar, in the Akola t\u00e1luk, is held by a Muhammadan convert family, a most exceptional case in Ber\u00e1r. The distribution of the population of the District by occupation showed that there were 9448 males, and 368 females, total 9816, belonging to the \u2018professional class\u2019; 3454 males, and 240 females, total 3694, to the \u2018domestic\u2019; 7687 males, and 77 females, total 7764, to the \u2018commercial\u2019; 153,799 males, and 88,882 females, total 242,681, to the \u2018agricultural\u2019; 31,811 males, and 25,211 females, total 57,022, to the \u2018industrial\u2019; and 101,847 males, and 169,968 females, total 271,815, to the \u2018indefinite and non-productive\u2019 classes. The principal towns are Akola, population 16,614; Akot, 16,137; Khamgaon, 12,390; Balapur, 11,244; Jalgaon, 10,392; Shegaon, 11,079; Patur, 7219; Hiwarkhed, 7300; Waodegaon, 6096; Barsi Takli, 5377; Jamod, 5258; Sonala, 5130; Argaum (Arg\u00e1on), 4625; and Pinjar, 3311.\n\nThe Holi, Dasah\u00e1ra, and Pola are the principal festivals, the latter in honour of the plough cattle of the village. The languages generally spoken by the people of the District are Mar\u00e1th\u00ed and Urdu.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The principal kharif or autumn crops of the District are cotton, great millet (jo\u00e1r), b\u00e1jra, pulses, and til; and the most valuable rab\u00ed or spring crops are wheat, gram, linseed, peas, mustard, and tobacco. Market garden crops, generally irrigated, include sugar-cane, onions, p\u00e1n, sweet potatoes, plantains, grapes (at Jumbod only), etc. The principal natural products are dyes and gums. Some jute is grown near B\u00e1lapur. Such rotation of crops as experience has shown to be necessary is practised. The average produce of land per acre is for cotton, 58 lbs.; wheat, 282 lbs.; oilseeds, 196 lbs.; jo\u00e1r, 186 lbs.; tobacco, 304 lbs.; rice, 64 lbs.; and gram, 260 lbs. Grass is cut and stacked at the end of the rains. The strong-rooted grass called kund,\noffers, in deep soils especially, great obstruction to ploughing; but the best black soil, if it has been properly cleared of this grass, does not require ploughing more than once in fifteen or twenty years, and is merely scarified with a steel-edged implement called *wakhar*. The farmers consider frequent ploughing exhausting. *Banni* cotton (the best and earliest variety) is gathered in November, and *jari* in December; if well cared for, each kind should yield three pickings. The current prices in *sers* of 2 lbs. ruling in the District in 1880\u201381, per rupee (2s.), were for clean cotton, $2\\frac{1}{4}$ *sers*; wheat, $22$ *sers*; gram, $32$ *sers*; rice, $10\\frac{1}{2}$ *sers*; *jo\u00e1r*, $36\\frac{1}{4}$ *sers*; oil-seed, $12\\frac{1}{2}$ *sers*; and tobacco, $3\\frac{1}{4}$ *sers*. Horses, inferior, and few in number; ponies, more numerous, and better of their kind. Oxen, which are ridden as well as driven, are noted for their beauty, strength, activity, and endurance. The agricultural stock of the District in 1880\u201381 was, 245,376 cows and bullocks, 62,328 buffaloes, 5725 horses and ponies, 5258 donkeys, 72,946 sheep and goats, 150 camels, 22,674 carts, and 15,577 ploughs. The total area professionally surveyed (1881) showed 1,464,960 acres under cultivation, 30,720 acres cultivable, and 206,720 acres uncultivable waste, including 52,029 acres of grazing land. The most important crops in 1880\u201381 were\u2014cotton (two kinds), 342,498 acres; *jo\u00e1r* (the staple food of the people), 535,453; linseed, 83,596; wheat, 134,415; *b\u00e1jra*, 51,689; gram, 79,690; *til*, 5864; lac, 53,864; tobacco, 1814; *urd*, 1756; hemp or flax, 917; rice, 758; *tur*, 16,775; *kurdi*, 1729; sugar-cane, 538; other products, 22,717 acres. The average rate per acre, in 1880\u201381 of land suited for cotton was 2s. 8d.; wheat, 3s. 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d.; oil-seed, 3s.; *jo\u00e1r*, 2s. 8d.; tobacco, 5s. 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d.; rice, 3s. 7\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)d.; gram, 3s. 4\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)d.\n\n**Land Tenures.**\u2014When Akola was assigned to the British, the only recognised title to land was actual possession by the cultivator, with payment of revenue. Certain rights and prescriptive privileges were allowed to long-settled occupants; but, as a rule, all ancient proprietary rights had been extinguished by the *t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs* and revenue farmers. The British Government has now given stability to the tenure of land by instituting leases for thirty years, under which the occupant is, subject to specified restriction, acknowledged as a heritable proprietor. The wage of a harvest labourer, when he is not paid in kind, is 4\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d. to 6d. a day.\n\n**Natural Calamities.**\u2014Owing to the scarcity of water, the District suffers greatly in years of extreme drought. In 1862, a year of famine, the loss of cattle was very great. Severe visitations of cholera are common.\n\n**Manufactures and Trade.**\u2014Coarse cotton cloth is woven in nearly every village; and at Akot and B\u00e1lapur, good cotton carpets and turbans are manufactured. Weekly markets are held in every con-\nsiderable village and town, and petty traders visit the most frequented of these with foreign groceries and cheap manufactures. Three principal fairs\u2014at P\u00e1t\u00far Shaikh B\u00e1bu, in February, lasting twenty days; at Son\u00e1la, in November, five days; and at Akot, in November, twelve days\u2014attract large numbers of traders from long distances.\n\nChief imports, sugar, salt, hardware, piece goods, wheat, oil, opium, cocoa-nuts, and rice; principal exports, cotton, wheat, linseed, gh\u00ed, indigo (a little), saffron, and cattle. The trade products of the District, before the construction of the railway, were conveyed by a class of carriers, called banj\u00e1ras, or owners of pack-bullocks; but the railway and new roads have impoverished these people to such an extent that they are now labourers, not carriers as of old. Kh\u00e1mgaon, now the largest cotton mart in Ber\u00e1r, is connected with the Great Indian Peninsula main line of railway, by a branch nearly 8 miles long; its trade is over \u00a34,000,000 sterling a year. Other cotton marts have risen in importance, specially Shegaon, distant 11 miles east, on the main line, which is more conveniently situated for cotton from the north of the District, and is a formidable rival to Kh\u00e1mgaon, having a trade of about \u00a32,543,000; Akot, of about \u00a3377,000; and Akola, of about \u00a31,000,000.\n\nRoads and Railways.\u2014There are 261 miles of made road in the District, and 65 miles of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, having seven stations, pass through it. One of the stations, J\u00e1num, forms the junction for Kh\u00e1mgaon, to which place there is a State line, 7\u00bd miles in length.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The District is administered by a Deputy-Commissioner, with whom are associated 5 Assistant or extra-Assistant-Commissioners, 5 Tahsildars, and 4 Honorary Magistrates; a Civil Surgeon, a Superintendent of Police, and an Executive District Engineer. In 1880\u201381 the total revenue of the District was \u00a3238,785, of which \u00a3178,810 was derived from land. The total cost of officials and police of all kinds for the same year was put down at \u00a39483. Sanctioned strength of police, 92 officers and 470 men. One central jail at Akola; daily average of prisoners in 1880, 595; cost per head, \u00a36, 6s.; death-rate, 3\u00b796 per cent. Crimes attended with violence have much decreased under British rule. Muhammadan convicts form more than one-fifth of the jail population, while their proportion to the Hindu District population is about one to eleven. Number of Government and aided schools, in 1881, was 254, with 9629 scholars. At Akola there is a college for training teachers. Branches of the Ber\u00e1r Government Central Book Depot supply the District with English, Mar\u00e1thi, Sanskrit, Persian, and Urdu works; two newspapers, the Ber\u00e1r Sam\u00e1-ch\u00e1r and the Urdu Akhb\u00e1r, are also published. Akola (population 16,608), Kh\u00e1mgaon (population 12,390), and Shegaon (population 11,079), are municipalities.\nMeteorological Aspects, etc.\u2014The hot season begins in March, and lasts for about three and a half months, during which sunstrokes followed by cholera often occur. The rains commence about the middle of June, and last until the end of August. September and October are usually hot and moist. The coldest season is from November to February; frost is very rare. It is said that the great extension of cultivation since British rule, has decreased the water in the wells. Average temperature at Akola town in the shade in May, $114^\\circ$ F.; in December, $45^\\circ$. Average annual rainfall at Akola, about twenty-four inches.\n\nPrincipal diseases: Cholera, which is endemic; fevers; and bowel complaints. In 1880, seven Government dispensaries afforded relief to 46,515 patients, of whom 548 were in-door. The number of births registered in 1880 was 23,792; deaths, 12,567. Death-rate, 26\u00b72 per 1000. Average death-rate 48\u00b72, and births 49\u00b75 per 1000 of the population; deaths by snakes or wild beasts in 1880\u201381, 34. Number of vaccine operations in the same year, 17,541; the Muhammadans are less ready than Hindus to have their children vaccinated.

Akola was long the head-quarters of a sub-district under the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s Government, its old brick fort and stone-faced walls with bastions still testifying to its importance. It formed the scene of a battle (date uncertain) between the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s troops and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. Pind\u00e1ri Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n was defeated in 1790 below its walls, by the Bhonsla general; and General Wellesley encamped in it for a day in 1803. During the later years of the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s rule, it declined, owing to the malpractices of the native officer in charge, who robbed...\nand did not keep off other robbers; and many of the inhabitants emigrated to Amr\u00e1oti. Under the British Government, it has increased in trade and population, and is now the head-quarters of the Judicial Commissioner of Ber\u00e1r. The town is bisected by the Morn\u00e1 river, Akola Proper being on the west bank, and T\u00e1jn\u00e1pet, with the European houses and Government buildings, on the east. There are two market days, the principal one being held at T\u00e1jn\u00e1pet on Sundays, and the other at Akola on Wednesdays. A cotton market was established about 1868 in T\u00e1jn\u00e1pet, with presses, and the trade developed rapidly. Public buildings: Commissioner\u2019s and Deputy-Commissioner\u2019s offices; courts; jail; barracks; a town hall; a church; post-office; hospital; charitable dispensary; rest-houses for both European and native travellers; schools.

Between the hills are rich valleys watered by unfailing streams. Turan Mall hill overlooks the pargan\u00e1 from the east. The hills are believed to contain veins of silver, copper, and iron. The heat of the plateau is at all times moderate; during the winter months the cold is severe, ice forming in wells and streams. During the monsoon the fall of rain is excessive. The inhabitants are Bhils, belonging to the two tribes of V\u00e1rl\u00eds and P\u00e1vr\u00e1s. Five passes lead from Kh\u00e1ndesh into Akr\u00e1ni; the one most used is the N\u00e1n\u00e1g\u00e1o Pass; the others, the Dodh\u00e1buv\u00e1, the Ch\u00e1ndseli, the Surp\u00e1n, and the Kuraip\u00e1n\u00ed, are much more difficult. The export of grain from Akr\u00e1ni is considerable, the exports being estimated at about \u00a31400. The chief owns two villages, and draws a yearly pension of \u00a3286, 16s., and has the title of R\u00e1n\u00e1. The family ranks high, and has intermarried with the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1s of Baroda and the R\u00e1n\u00e1 of Chhota Udaipur. The total revenue in good seasons is about \u00a31500.\n\nAkyab.\u2014District in Arakan Division, British Burma, lying between 20\u00b0 and 21\u00b0 24' N. lat., and between 92\u00b0 14' and 94\u00b0 E. long.; area 5535 square miles; population (1881) 359,706 souls. Of the total area 662 square miles are returned (1881) as cultivated, 968 as culti-\nvable waste, and 3905 as uncultivable. Bounded on the north by the Chittagong Hill Tracts; on the south by numerous straits and inlets of the sea; on the east by the Arakan Yoma mountains, separating it from Independent Burma; and on the west by the Bay of Bengal. The administrative head-quarters are at Akyab town, on the Kuladan river.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Akyab consists of the level tract lying between the sea and the Arakan Yoma mountains, and of the broken country formed by a portion of their western spurs and valleys. Through these hills flow the three principal rivers of the District,\u2014viz. the Mayu, Kuladan (Koladyne), and Lemru,\u2014at first mountain torrents, but spreading out on the plains into a network of channels, and forming a delta as they merge into the sea by interlacing tidal creeks. The Mayu rises in the mountains forming the north-western boundary of the District, and, after following a south-south-east course, reaches the sea a few miles north-west of Akyab. The Kuladan, the most important river of Akyab, enters the District at the village from which it takes its name, and marks the boundary for a distance of about 16 miles; it rises in the main range in the neighbourhood of the Blue Mountain (5676 feet), and falls into the sea at Akyab town. Its mouth forms a spacious harbour, but the entrance is rendered difficult by a bar. In the rainy reason, it is navigable by vessels of 400 tons burden for 70 miles above Akyab, and by boats of 40 tons for 50 miles higher. The Lemru enters the District in its eastern portion, about 12 miles east of the village of Mahamuni, and also rises in the main range far in the north, and falls into the sea in Hunter\u2019s Bay. The Arakan Yoma range, in long. 94\u00b0, forms the eastern boundary of Akyab, and its spurs cover the whole portion of the District east of the Lemru. A pass leading across this range, connects the District with Upper Burma. In the west, between the Naaf and the Mayu rivers, and terminating near the mouth of the latter, is the steep Mayu range, the southern part of which runs parallel with, and not far from, the coast. This range is traversed by several passes, which are only practicable for foot passengers. Through one of these, the Aleh-khaung, the Burmese force retreated before General Morrison, during the first Burmese war (1824\u201325). Between the Mayu and Kuladan rivers, in the north-western portion of the District, the country is hilly, and broken by numerous intervening spurs and valleys, running parallel to the Mayu range. The forests form a most important feature of Akyab District, and contain a valuable supply of timber of many kinds. The low ground near the sea is covered with forests of mangrove; farther inland the principal trees are the sit (Albizia procera), the pyin-ma (Lagerstr\u00e6mia regin\u00e6), the kabaung (Strychnos nux vomica), the ka-nyin (Dipterocarpus alata) and the lekpan (Bombax malabaricum). But the most valuable timber is found on the lower ranges. On these, the tree most frequently met\nwith is the *pyin-kado* (Xylia dolabriformis), of which some has, at various times, been exported for railway sleepers. The wood is used for bridges, boats, house-posts, etc., and is much esteemed. Teak plantations have of late years been made in the upper parts of the tract drained by the Kuladan and Lemru rivers. Numerous other valuable timber trees are found, among which may be mentioned the *thit-pauk* (Dalbergia sp.) and *thingan* (Hopea odorata), used for boat-building. Bamboo abounds everywhere.\n\n**History.**\u2014Akyab was the metropolitan Province of the native kingdom of Arakan, and the history of that country centres in it. The following sketch will therefore recapitulate the leading facts, which have been collected from the Burmese annals, for the whole of Arakan. The earliest traditions, obscure and for the most part incredible, endeavour to magnify the connection between Arakan and India, the cradle of the Buddhist faith. Long before the birth of Gautama Buddha, the Burmese chroniclers state that an Arakanese kingdom, with its capital at R\u00e1mawadi, near the modern Sandoway, paid tribute to the king of B\u00e1r\u00e1n\u00e1si (*Benares*). Ages later, Sekkyawadi, who was in a future life to be born as Gautama Buddha, reigned in Benares, and allotted to his fourth son, Kanmyin, \u2018all the countries inhabited by the Burman, Sh\u00e1n, and Malay races, from Manipur to the borders of China.\u2019 Kanmyin peopled his dominions with a multitude of non-Aryan tribes from the north-east, and settled the progenitors of the present Arakanese upon a strip of land between the Yoma Mountains and the sea, which they still inhabit. The only value of these traditions is, that they point to a connection with India, and to Aryan influences, prior to the introduction of Buddhism. But it should be remembered that they were compiled in a Buddhistic age; and their historical accuracy may be judged of from the circumstance, that the number of years during which Kanmyin\u2019s dynasty reigned, is represented in the Palm-Leaf Records by a unit followed by 140 cyphers.\n\nThe Muhammadans make their appearance in Arakan about 800 A.D.; several of their ships having been wrecked on R\u00e1mri island, not far south of Akyab; and their crews settled in the adjoining villages. The Arakanese capital still continued at R\u00e1mawadi, near the modern Sandoway. In the 9th century, the King of Arakan made an expedition into Bengal, and set up a pillar at Chittagong, which, according to the Burmese tradition, takes its name (Sit-ta-gaung) from a remark of the conqueror, that \u2018to make war was improper.\u2019 Towards the end of the 10th century, the King of Prome, in the Irawadi valley, pressed hard upon southern Arakan; and the capital was removed northwards to Mrohaung (\u2018Old Arakan\u2019), in Akyab District, where it continued (with intervals), until the head-quarters of the Province were finally changed to Akyab town, by the British, in 1826. The next five\ncenturies are filled with annals of invasions from the south and east, by the Burmese, Sh\u00e1ns, Talaings, Py\u00fas, and other tribes from beyond the Yom\u00e1 ranges, which separate Arakan from the Irawadi valley, and with internal revolutions or dynastic struggles among the Arakanese themselves. A Burmese inscription at Buddh-Gay\u00e1, in Beh\u00e1r, describes a king of Arakan in the 12th century, as \u2018Lord of a hundred thousand Py\u00fas,\u2019 or inhabitants of the Pagan kingdom in the Irawadi valley, to which kingdom Arakan seems then to have been subject. Between 1133 and 1153 A.D., reigned Gaw-laya, \u2018to whom the kings of Bengal, Pegu, Pagan, and Siam did homage,\u2019 and who built the temple of Mahati, in Akyab District, a few miles south of the capital, \u2018Old Arakan.\u2019 This temple, second only to that of Mah\u00e1m\u00fani, was occupied as a fort by the Burmese troops in 1825, and unfortunately destroyed by our troops in driving them out. The oldest Arakanese coins, bearing the emblems of royalty, belong to the 12th century. In the 13th century the Arakanese began to push northwards into south-eastern Bengal, and twice received tribute or presents (circa 1237 and 1294 A.D.) from the Bengali kings at Sonargaon, in Dacca District. A dynastic struggle in Arakan led to the King of Ava being called in as an ally in 1404, and the kingdom remained subject to him till 1430, when its independence was established, and Mrohaung (\u2018Old Arakan\u2019) was again fixed on as the capital. During the remainder of the 15th century, Arakan enjoyed comparative rest; but the 16th century brought fresh attacks by the Burmese from the interior, and by the Portuguese from the seaboard. In 1531, the capital, \u2018Old Arakan,\u2019 was fortified against the latter adventurers, by a stone wall 18 feet high; and in 1571, it was further strengthened by lakes excavated around it, traversed only by narrow causeways. Between 1560 and 1570, the Arakanese conquered Chittagong, and the King\u2019s son was appointed governor. This connection with the northward, led the Arakanese King to realize the power of the encroaching Mughal Empire. He accordingly encouraged the Portuguese corsairs and outlaws from Goa to make shore settlements on the coast of Arakan, provided them with wives and lands, and gave over Chittagong to them as a pirate harbour. These river bandits formed a good defence against the Mughal galleys; but they also proved troublesome to their Arakanese patrons. About 1605, the nest of sea-robbers at Chittagong threw off their nominal allegiance to the Arakan King; and in 1609, the latter resumed their grants of land, and drove them out of that harbour. They took refuge in the island of Sandwip, at the mouth of the Ganges, where they first put every Muhammadan to death, and whence they next despatched an unsuccessful expedition against Arakan. Their leader, Sebastian Gonzales, a low Portuguese, had been successively a common soldier, a dealer in salt, and a pirate. One of the rival kings of Arakan, being\ndriven by a dynastic revolution to seek refuge at Sandwip, was first received with ostentatious hospitality, then forced to give his sister in marriage to the Portuguese ruffian, and died suddenly, not without suspicion of poison. Gonzales joined with the new Arakan King against the Mughals, then destroyed the Arakan fleet, and entered into treaty, as an independent prince, with the Portuguese Viceroy at Goa, to invade Arakan. The admiral and the pirate chief were separately defeated; the former fell in action, the latter was deserted by his followers, and perished miserably. The King of Arakan took possession of Sandwip, whence he annually plundered the Bengal Delta, carrying off the people as slaves to Arakan. In 1661, Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1, the Mughal Viceroy of Bengal, and son of the Emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, being defeated by his brother, Aurangzeb, sought refuge in Arakan, and was received with great pomp. But the Arakan King soon afterwards demanded his guest's daughter in marriage; and, on being haughtily refused, he seized and drowned the Muhammadan prince, and killed all his sons. The princess whom he had sought in marriage, stabbed herself rather than submit to the embraces of an infidel barbarian; two of her sisters took poison, and the third, forced to wed the Arakan King, either died of grief, or was brutally murdered when about to become a mother. Not one of Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1's family survived; and his father, the aged Emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, bitterly exclaimed, 'Could not the cursed infidel have left one son alive to avenge the wrongs of his grandfather!'\n\nThis marks the climax of Arakanese power and insolence. Aurangzeb, although glad to be rid of a rival brother, determined to show that no member of the imperial family might be thus treated with impunity. Sha\u00edst\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n, his Viceroy in Bengal (1664\u20131675), first joined with the Portuguese to inflict a crushing punishment on the Arakan King; then seized Chittagong, and treated his Portuguese allies as pirates and traitors. During the next century dynastic struggles wasted Arakan, and exposed it to every sort of foreign and domestic calamity. In 1784, the Burmese gave the final blow to the ancient kingdom of Arakan. The Burmese armies broke into the country in three separate bodies, each under command of a royal prince, and annexed the whole Province. The Arakanese fled in great numbers, from the barbarities of the conquerors, into British territory, and settled in Chittagong, and on the estuary and islands of the Ganges. Others revolted, but their risings were cruelly suppressed; and the survivors again found shelter within the British frontier. The Burmese monarch, having in vain demanded the surrender of the refugees, attacked the East India Company's elephant-hunters, sent retaliatory expeditions into our Districts, insolently seized the British island of Sh\u00e1hpur\u00ed, between Akyab and Bengal, and drove out our detachment in charge of it.\nAfter much forbearance and remonstrance, Lord Amherst declared war against the Burmese on the 24th Feb. 1824. The following account of our operations in Akyab District is condensed from Captain Spearman's narrative in the *British Burma Gazetteer*:\n\n'A force under General Morrison moved on Arakan, and another, under Sir Archibald Campbell, operated by way of the valley of the Irawadi. On the 2nd February 1825, the first detachment of British troops crossed the Naaf from Chittagong; and, after a tedious but unopposed march, arrived in front of Arakan town on the 28th of the same month, supported by a flotilla under Commodore Hayes, which, not without resistance on the part of the Burmese, had proceeded up the Kuladan and through the creeks. \"Old Arakan\" was found to be strongly fortified, the Burmese commander having added to the ancient entrenchments, and erected a line of stockades along the hills. The single pass through the hills to the town, was at the northern extremity of the line of defence, and this was protected by several guns and four thousand muskets; the total garrison was 9000 men. The ground in front was clear and open, and the only cover was a belt of jungle which ran along the base of the hills, while beyond this again the ground was fully exposed to the enemy's fire. On the morning of the 29th March, the storming party, under Brigadier-General M'Bean, advanced to attack the pass. It consisted of the light company of the 54th Regiment, four companies of the 2nd Regiment L.I., the light companies of the 10th and 16th M.N.I., and the rifle company of the M\u00e1gh Levy, and was supported by six companies of the 16th Regiment M.N.I. Under the well-directed and steady fire of the Burmese, and the avalanche of stones which they poured down upon the heads of the troops, the British were repulsed; and at last, when Captain French, of the 16th Regiment M.N.I., had been killed, and all the remaining officers wounded, the storming party retreated. The plan of attack was then changed, and it was determined to attempt to turn the right flank of the Burmese, whilst their attention was occupied by an attack on their front. On the 30th March, a battery was erected to play upon the works commanding the pass, and on the 31st it opened fire. At about eight in the evening, a force under Brigadier Richards left the camp; it consisted of six companies of the 44th Regiment, three of the 26th, and three of the 49th Native Infantry, thirty seamen under Lieutenant Armstrong of the *Research*, and thirty dismounted troopers of Gardener's Horse. The hill was nearly five hundred feet high, and the ascent steep and winding. All remained quiet till shortly after eleven, when a shot from the hill showed that the enemy had discovered the approach of Brigadier Richards' party. This single shot was followed by a short but sharp fire, when the Burmese turned, and the hill was in the possession of the British. The next day a six-pounder was dragged up the\nhill, and fire was opened on the heights commanding the pass; while at the same time, Brigadier Richards moved against it from the position which he had taken the night before, and Brigadier M'Bean along his original line of advance. The Burmese, after a feeble defence, abandoned the works and the town. The capture of Arakan town ended the war as far as the Arakan Province was concerned. The Burmese troops at once abandoned R\u00e1mr\u00ed and Sandoway, and retreated across the mountains into Pegu; and the steady advance of Sir Archibald Campbell up the valley of the Irawadi, driving the Burmese forces before him, prevented any attempt on their part to disturb our possession. This advance ended at Yandab\u00fa, where a treaty was signed on the 24th February 1826, by which Arakan and Tenasserim became British territory.\n\nOn the withdrawal of the main body of the British army from Burma, one regiment was left in Akyab, and a local Arakan battalion was raised. Next year (1827), and again in 1836, unsuccessful efforts were made to tamper with the local irregulars, or to stir up the people. With these momentary exceptions, the peace of the Province has remained absolutely undisturbed since its annexation in 1826, and all classes have heartily accepted the rest and security guaranteed by British rule.\n\nPopulation.\u2014On its annexation in 1826, Arakan was found to be almost depopulated. In the first years of British rule, the descendants of those who had escaped to Chittagong on the Burmese conquest returned in large numbers, and inhabitants flocked in from the adjoining territories of the King of Burma. In 1831, the population of Akyab District, then inclusive of the adjoining Hill Tracts on the north (now forming a separate District), had risen to 95,098; in 1852, to 201,677. Since 1862, when the Provinces of Arakan, Pegu, and Tenasserim were erected into a separate administration, as British Burma, large accessions of inhabitants have taken place, both from native territory and our own Bengal seaboard. In 1872, the population of Akyab District, inclusive of the Hill Tracts, was close on 300,000. Exclusive of the Hill Tracts, Akyab District had a population of 276,671. In 1881, the total population of the District, as at present existing, was returned at 359,706, the following being the classes represented and their numbers:\u2014Hindus, 8812; Muhammadans, 99,548; Christians, 1114; Buddhists and Jains, 230,046; Nat worshippers and others, 20,186; the adult males numbered 148,028; females, 105,152; total, 253,180. Children under twelve years, males, 55,096; females, 51,430; total, 106,526. Number of occupied houses, 68,057; number of persons per square mile, 65; per house, 5\u00b728. The agricultural population numbered 263,104, or 73\u00b715 per cent. of the total population. There is a small community of Chinese included among the Buddhists. Nat worshipper is a term\nused in British Burma to denote the non-Buddhist indigenous races, whose sole religion consists in a kind of worship of spirits or demons, supposed to reside in the hills, forests and streams, and to preside over the destinies of mankind. The Arakanese are of Burmese origin, but separated from the parent stock by the Arakan Yoma mountains, and they have a dialect and customs of their own. Their kingdom was conquered by the Burmese during the last century, but they have remained distinct from their conquerors. Their type of face is as much Aryan as Mongolian, and in character and habits they partially resemble the Indian races. Females are secluded, and early marriages of girls are now frequent. Many of the Muhammadans included in the Census, are men who had come from Chittagong to the District for the working season. The resident Muhammadans are, chiefly, the descendants of slaves of the Burmese and Arakanese monarchs. They differ from the Arakanese only in their religious observances; they use the Burmese alphabet and speech, but among themselves preserve, colloquially, the language of their ancestors in Bengal. The Hindus have been in the country for many generations. Among them, the Manipuri Br\u00e1hmans were invited by the Burmese as astrologers; a few Doms, a very low and despised caste, were brought from Bengal to serve as pagoda slaves. In Burma, the strange custom prevails of employing outcastes as sweepers of the pagodas. The Doms, now released from their hereditary slavery, have become cultivators, but have risen no higher in social rank. The Muhammadan immigrants intermarry freely with the women of the country; while the Hindus, from caste prejudices, rarely do so. The Hill Tribes (14,499) are fully described in the articles on the ARAKAN and CHITTAGONG HILL TRACTS. The Chauntha are of the same race as the lowland Arakanese, but inhabit the banks of mountain streams. The number of persons employed in agriculture was (1881) 116,060; and in mechanical arts, manufactures, etc., 22,055. The agriculturists numbered 263,104, or 73'15 per cent. of the whole population. The only towns are AKYAB on the Kuladan (Koladyne) river, population 33,989; and 'Old Arakan' or MROHAUNG ('old town'), the ancient fortress and capital of the kingdom of Arakan, population 3000. Besides these two towns, the District contains only 1 village with 1000 to 2000 inhabitants; 44 villages with 500 to 1000; 542 with 200 to 500; and 1340 with fewer than 200\u2014making in all 1929 towns and villages.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Rice forms the staple crop, and is grown in the extensive fertile plains, stretching from the foot of the northern hills to the sea-coast. It is exported from the port of Akyab, which is very easy of access by the numerous creeks around it, and has a spacious harbour. Acreage under cultivation (1881)\u2014rice, 341,523 acres; oil-seeds, 219 acres; sugar, 88 acres; tea, 170 acres; cocoa-nuts, 433 acres; betel-\nnuts, 795 acres; *dhani*, 8208 acres; plantains, 1844 acres; *p\u0101n* (betel-leaf), 714 acres; vegetables, 1874 acres; hemp, 90 acres; mixed fruit trees, 9101 acres; chillies, 3000 acres; indigo, 2 acres; and tobacco, 8 acres. Cattle disease and the cyclone of 1867 threw 39,000 acres out of cultivation in 1868. The high prices during the Bengal scarcity of 1874, gave a new impetus to rice cultivation. The holding of each cultivator averages $8\\frac{1}{2}$ acres. The current prices of the chief articles of food during 1880\u201381 per maund of 80 lbs. were\u2014 for rice, 4s. to 5s.; sugar, \u00a31 to \u00a31, 10s.; salt, 3s.: and the average produce of land per acre in lbs., for indigo, was 200; for oil-seeds, 910; for sugar-cane, 672; for tobacco, 370; for vegetables, 1000; and for tea, 106. The *taungya*, or nomadic system of husbandry, still lingers in Akyab District. It resembles the *jum* tillage of the Hill Tribes in Chittagong. The *taungya* cultivator burns down the jungle, raises a rapid series of exhausting crops from the open spot, and then deserts it for a fresh clearing. Some tribes cultivate the same patch for two or three years, after which the hamlet migrates *en masse*. Another process is thus described by the Chief Commissioner of British Burma:\u2014\u2018A hill-slope is selected in the cold weather; its jungle cut down in April, and burnt in May, the ashes being spread over the ground; and several crops are sown together at the beginning of the rains (June).\u2019 The harvest continues from August to October. The Indian corn ripens at the end of July; a crop of melons and vegetables follows in August; the rice harvest is reaped in September; and a cotton crop concludes the exhausting series in October. \u2018The same spot,\u2019 adds the Chief Commissioner, \u2018can only be cultivated on this system once in ten years.\u2019 It is profitable as long as a superabundance of fresh land is available, and is now being abandoned as wasteful, before the increasing pressure of the population. The *taungya* cultivator pays no rent, but a poll-tax of two shillings a year *per family* in Arakan; and *per male* in Tenasserim and other parts of British Burma. The more economical tillage by the plough, is gradually extirpating this primitive form of husbandry in Akyab District. In 1855 there were 5355 *taungya* cultivators or \u2018cutters;\u2019 in 1879 the number had fallen to 4895; in 1881, to 4310. In 1882 the number was much greater, but I have been unable to ascertain whether the increase was nominal or real, up to the time when this sheet had to be printed off. Agricultural stock has increased rapidly, notwithstanding the plague of 1867. In 1881, the agricultural stock of the District comprised 109,969 buffaloes; 160,996 cows and bullocks; 373 horses and ponies; 6802 sheep and goats; 7512 pigs; 4544 carts; 56,030 ploughs; and 14,434 boats. The chief means of communication in the country are the tidal creeks, which account for the large number of boats returned. The Chittagong men are the chief carriers of grain, from the interior of the District to the\ntown of Akyab. Wages are high; unskilled labourers are reported (1881) to earn from Rs. 15 to Rs. 30 (3s. to 6s.) a month in the shipping season, and skilled labourers Rs. 60 (\u00a36).\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014A little salt is manufactured near the Naaf river, by a mixed process of solar evaporation and boiling; but the quantity diminishes each year, owing to the cheapness of imported salt. There are no mines and quarries in the District. About 700 persons are employed in making earthen pots, in Akyab, Minbra, and Rathaidaung. Before its conquest by the British, large boats from Mrohaung ('Old Arakan'), up the river, visited the ports of Bengal for British manufactures of muslins, woollens, cutlery, piece-goods, glass, and crockery. A small trade was also carried on with the other Burmese ports on the east. When the British Government removed the restrictions on trade imposed by the Burmese, Akyab quickly rose into an important seat of maritime commerce.\n\nCommunications, Trade.\u2014The trade of the District centres in the town of AKYAB (q.v.). There are no railways in Akyab; communication is carried on chiefly by water. Total length of roads within the District, 83 miles; of water communication, 2460 miles.\n\nRevenue, etc.\u2014The revenue has more than kept pace with the increase of population. In 1828, the whole revenue of the three Districts, that were then included in the Province of Arakan, was estimated at \u00a322,000 per annum. In 1831, Akyab District alone yielded \u00a324,019; in 1840, \u00a337,970. In 1837, the old native taxes on forest produce, huts, boats, houses, sugar-presses, handicraftsmen, etc., had been abolished, making a remission of \u00a39735. By 1875, the gross revenue of the District from land, capitation tax, excise, etc., but exclusive of municipal and local funds, had risen to \u00a3208,369. In 1875, the land-tax amounted to \u00a359,465. The taungyas, or nomadic cultivators, paid \u00a3331. The capitation tax, paid by all males between 18 and 60 years of age, was, in 1875, assessed on 70,040 persons; and yielded \u00a328,359, at the rate of about Rs. 4 (8s.) per head of the assessed population. The excise revenue amounted to \u00a315,773. Customs have increased from \u00a318,159 in 1855\u201356 to \u00a337,785 in 1865\u201366, and \u00a370,062 in 1875\u201376. In 1881, the land revenue alone amounted to \u00a370,171, and the gross or total revenue to \u00a3231,727, including \u00a3127,315 for customs dues, excise, timber, etc.; \u00a331,423, capitation tax on 77,489 persons; \u00a3948 for fisheries; and \u00a31827, house-tax on 8749 houses. The local taxes not included in the Imperial revenue amounted to \u00a38643.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The District is administered by a Deputy Commissioner, an Assistant Commissioner, a Magistrate for the island and town of Akyab, eight extra-Assistant Commissioners, an Akhun-wun, or a revenue officer, a Superintendent of Police, a Civil Surgeon, an Executive\nEngineer, a Collector of Customs, a Master Attendant, a Deputy-Inspector of Schools, a Telegraph Superintendent, and a Postmaster. Akyab has 9 judicial and revenue sub-divisions, and is divided into 126 circles, of which 114 are denominated kywon, or islands, being situated in the lowlands, and 12 are called khyauung, or streams, being in the hill districts; these circles contain altogether 1928 villages. Each circle is placed under an indigenous officer, thugyi, whose duties are to collect the revenue, to preserve order, and to assist the police in the apprehension of criminals, to compile statistics, and to settle disputes concerning land. Each circle comprises from 3 or 4 to 15 or 20 villages. The thugyi is assisted by the gaung, or village head. The police force of the District consisted, in 1880, of 457 men, and 5 officers, costing \u00a39490. Number of prisoners in Akyab Jail, 745 in 1881\u2014employed in stone-breaking, coir-pounding, jute-spinning, road-making, carpentry, smiths' work, and timber-sawing. The total expenditure on jails in 1881 was \u00a32205, of which a little more than one-third was defrayed by the profits arising from convict-labour. In 1880, the total number of patients treated in the Hospital and Dispensary was 4157. There are (1881) 3 Government and 114 private inspected schools in the District, attended by 2465 pupils. The total expenditure on these schools in 1881 amounted to \u00a31632. There are also a number of private uninspected schools; and the Census Report of 1881 returns 13,031 boys and 2498 girls as under instruction, and those who are able to read and write as 56,333, including 1797 females. The Government School, established in 1846, was made a High School in 1875. One newspaper is published in the District, the Arakan News, at Akyab.\n\nClimate, etc.\u2014The climate of Arakan is malarious. Average rainfall for the five years ending 1882, 182.7 inches. [For further information, see The Gazetteer of British Burma, vol. i. (1879-80); Provincial Administration Reports, 1880-81 and 1881-82; Census Report, 1881; and Departmental Reports to 1881-82.]\n\nAkyab.\u2014Town, seaport, and head-quarters of Arakan Division and of Akyab District, British Burma; at the mouth of the Kuladan river. Lat. 20\u00b0 6' 45\" N., long. 92\u00b0 56' 30\" E. Formed into a municipality in 1874. Originally a Magh fishing village, Akyab dates its prosperity from the time when it was chosen as the chief station of the Arakan Province, at the close of the first Burmese war (1826). The troops and civil establishments were removed here from Mrohaung, or Myohoung ('Old Arakan'), the last capital of the Arakanese kingdom, owing to the unhealthiness of that town; but the military were afterwards withdrawn, and the cantonment abandoned, except by the European civil officers. Under British rule Akyab rapidly grew into the seat of an extensive rice trade, being accessible by boats from the\nfertile plains in the interior, and possessing a good harbour, protected from the south-western monsoon by Savage Island, on which the lighthouse is situated. The town is 15 feet above the level of the sea at half-tide, with places below the sea level at high water, but it has been laid out with broad raised roads, forming causeways, with deep ditches on either side. The chief obstacle to the advancement of the city is the want of labour; the roads, ditches, tanks, etc., are almost entirely the work of convicts. An influx of inhabitants from the Chittagong coast and Mrohaung had, before 1836, developed the Magh fishing village into a thriving seaport, and the town now possesses numerous public buildings and substantial houses. In 1868 the inhabitants numbered 15,536; in 1872, 19,230; in 1881, 33,998, classified thus:\n\n|        | Males | Females |\n|--------|-------|---------|\n| Hindus | 6,243 | 121     |\n| Muhammadans | 11,730 | 1,834   |\n| Buddhists | 6,932 | 6,004   |\n| Christians | 943 | 173     |\n| Others | 15    | 3       |\n| Total  | 25,863 | 8,135   |\n\nThese figures include the floating population. The disproportion in the sexes amongst the Muhammadans and Hindus is owing to the number of men who come to the town for the rice season, to work either in conveying the unhulled rice from the interior, or as coolies in the rice mills.\n\nThe chief public buildings are the court-house, jail, custom-house, hospital, markets, two churches, travellers' bungalow, circuit-house, and Government schools. Akyab has five steam rice-husking mills, and several merchants' offices. The gross municipal revenue (from port dues, market rents, sale of town lands, etc.) in 1880-81 was \u00a39143; expenditure, \u00a38275. The following figures give an idea of the rapid growth of trade at Akyab: In 1826, when we obtained the Arakan Province, Akyab was a fishing village. After the cession of Arakan by the treaty of Yandab\u00fa, the old capital of Mrohaung was abandoned as the seat of government, and Akyab on the sea-coast selected instead. It had an excellent harbour, and the numerous creeks which intersect the country in its neighbourhood afforded easy means of communication with the interior. All restrictions on trade were removed, and as rice was in great demand and could be largely supplied by the District, the harbour came to be visited by ships and steamers in yearly increasing numbers. In 1830-31, during the shipping season between October and April, 140 square-rigged vessels cleared out, carrying cargoes valued at \u00a37378. In 1833 the number had increased to 178, and the value of the cargoes to \u00a39381. In 1840-41 the exports of rice, husked (15,970 tons) and unhusked\n(75,255 tons), amounted to the total value of \u00a3114,220, and the number of vessels cleared out in that year was 709. Ten years later, in 1851-52, though the number of ships cleared out had fallen to 394, the total value of the exports amounted to \u00a3168,382. The principal export trade was then with Madras, whence the grain was re-shipped as Madras rice. The annexation of Pegu at the conclusion of the second Burmese war, 1852-53, made but little difference in the trade of Akyab. The export of rice, husked and unhusked, continued to increase as did the trade generally. In 1861-62, the value of imports was \u00a3562,749, and of exports \u00a3460,153; ten years later, in 1871-72, the value of the imports was \u00a3763,764, and of the exports \u00a3546,016; aggregating \u00a31,309,780. In 1881-82, the values were\u2014imports, \u00a3735,132; exports, \u00a3920,057; total, \u00a31,655,189. Rice and petroleum are the two principal exports from Akyab, valuable sources of supply of the latter having been lately discovered on the Borongo Islands and in R\u00e1mri. There is but little import trade from Europe direct, almost all requirements being brought from India and from Rangoon. The imports from the United Kingdom consist of coal and machinery; of Indian produce from Indian ports, apparel, rope, cocoa-nuts, gunny bags, metals, mineral and vegetable oils, gh\u00ed, salted fish, silk piece goods, spices, sugar, and raw tobacco; and of foreign merchandise from the same ports, cotton twist, yarn and piece goods, hardware and cutlery, liquors, machinery, metals, and silk and woollen piece goods. The exports consist almost entirely of rice, husked and unhusked, hides and horns, cutch, mineral oil, salted fish, and betel-nuts. The course of trade, and the large revenues raised in Akyab District, render the import and export of treasure large. The average annual import of treasure during the five years ending 1881-82 was \u00a3422,841; the exports amounting to \u00a399,962. 'Akyab' is supposed to be a corruption of 'Akyat-daw,' the name of a pagoda in the neighbourhood, probably once a landmark for ships. In the Burmese language the place is called Tsit-twe, because the British Army encamped here in 1825.\n\nFrom the statistics given in the foregoing article, it will be seen that Akyab had grown from a fishing village to a town of 15,536 inhabitants during the first forty years of British rule, and that during the past thirteen years it has more than doubled its population\u2014from 15,536 to 34,000. In the fifty years from 1831 to 1881, its trade has multiplied more than 220 times, or from \u00a37378 to over 1\u00bd millions sterling. As communications are developed with Bengal, it is hoped that the labour difficulty will be still further diminished\u2014the difficulty which stands in the way of an immense expansion of the trade of Akyab town.\n\n**Akyaw.**\u2014Revenue circle of Thoon-khwa District, British Burma. Northern portion more cultivated than the south, which is a forest.\nInhabitants principally traders, fishermen, and rice cultivators. Land revenue (1874\u201375) \u00a3299. Capitation tax (1875\u201376) \u00a3180.\n\n**Al\u00e1bakhshpur.**\u2014One of the business quarters of Patna City, Bengal, with large trade in oil-seeds. Lat. 25\u00b0 36' N., long. 85\u00b0 15' E.\n\n**Al\u00e1g\u00e1r.**\u2014Range of low hills, Mad\u00fara District, Madras Presidency; about 12 miles in length, average height 1000 feet above the sea. Sandstone predominates in their composition, but a great variety of geological formations are found at their base. On the south-east face, at the foot of the hill, stands the Kall\u00e1r-Al\u00e1g\u00e1r Kovil, the ancient temple of the Kall\u00e1ns or Kall\u00e1rs, situated 12 miles north-east of Mad\u00fara. Lat. of Al\u00e1g\u00e1r Hill, 10\u00b0 6' N., long. 78\u00b0 17' 15\" E.\n\n**Al\u00e1hy\u00e1r-jo-Tando (Tando Al\u00e1hy\u00e1r).**\u2014T\u00e1luk in the H\u00e1l\u00e1 Subdivision, Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Sind, Bombay Presidency, lying between 25\u00b0 8' and 25\u00b0 50' N. lat., and between 68\u00b0 37' and 69\u00b0 2' E. long. Population (1881) 66,126; namely, Muhammadans, 49,319; Hindus, 10,467; Sikhs, 2242; aboriginal tribes, 4091; others, 5. Area, 696 square miles, with 61 towns and villages; number of occupied houses, 12,941. Revenue (1880\u201381), \u00a310,058; being \u00a39536 imperial, and \u00a3522 local.\n\n**Al\u00e1hy\u00e1r-jo-Tando (Tando Al\u00e1hy\u00e1r).**\u2014Chief town of t\u00e1luk of same name in Sind, Bombay Presidency. Lat 25\u00b0 27' N., long. 68\u00b0 45' E. Founded about 1790 by a son of the first sovereign of the Talpur dynasty. Population (1881) 3898. Trade in sugar, ivory, silk, cloth, cotton, oil, and grains; yearly amount about \u00a311,600; besides transit trade of \u00a316,100. Municipal revenue in 1880\u201381, \u00a3694; disbursements, \u00a3514; taxation per head, 3s. 2\u00bdd. Under the Talpur dynasty, the town attained considerable commercial importance, but has declined in modern times, especially since the opening of the railway line in 1861, between Kotri and Kar\u00e1chi which diverted the trade of northern Sind. Extensive cultivation of cotton; raw silk, metal pots, and ivory, are largely imported; silk weaving and ivory work form the chief local industries. The chief buildings are the fort, subordinate judge's court, post-office, dispensary, school, and market.\n\n**Al\u00e1ipur.**\u2014Trading village in Khuln\u00e1 District, Bengal, at the junction of the Bhairab and Ath\u00e1r\u00e1bank\u00e1 rivers. Lat. 22\u00b0 49' N., long. 89\u00b0 41' E. Noted for the manufacture, on a large scale, of excellent pottery.\n\n**Alaknanda.**\u2014River in Garhw\u00e1l District, North-Western Provinces; one of the main upper waters of the Ganges. It rises in the snowy ranges of the Him\u00e1layas, and runs through the central valley which forms the upper part of the Garhw\u00e1l District. The river is numbered among the sacred streams of India; and each of the points where it meets a considerable confluent is regarded as holy, and forms a station in the pilgrimage which devout Hindus make to Him\u00e1chal. The Alaknanda is itself formed by the junction of the Dhauli and Saraswati (Sarsuti) and receives in its course the Nand\u00e1kini, the Pindar, and the\nMand\u00e1kini. At Deopray\u00e1g it is joined by the Bh\u00e1girathi, and the united streams are henceforward known as the Ganges. Though the Alaknanda is the more important in volume and position, the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed is popularly considered the chief source of the holy river. The character of the Alaknanda is that of a mountain stream, and the only town upon its banks is Sr\u00ednagar in Garhw\u00e1l. Floods not unfrequently occur, one of which, before the British occupation, swept away the greater part of the town. Gold was formerly found in the sands of this river, but the search is so little remunerative that it has been discontinued.\n\n**Alamb\u00e1da\u00ed.**\u2014Town in Coimbatore District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 12\u00b0 9' N., long. 77\u00b0 49' E. On right bank of the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery), 65 miles east of Seringapatam. An important place in the 17th century. Garrisoned for a short time in 1768 by British troops, but relinquished on the advance of Haidar \u00c1lf\u2019s army.\n\n**Alamd\u00e1ng\u00e1.**\u2014Trading village on the Pang\u00e1s\u00ed river, Nadiy\u00e1 District, Bengal, and a station on the Eastern Bengal Railway; 93 miles from Calcutta. Since the opening of the railway, the rice trade has largely increased. Lat. 23\u00b0 45' 30\" N., long. 88\u00b0 59' 30\" E.\n\n**Alamg\u00edr Hill.**\u2014One of the peaks of the Assi\u00e1 range, in Orissa. Lat. 20\u00b0 37' N., long. 86\u00b0 16' E. On the summit of a precipice of this hill, 2500 feet above the neighbouring country, stands a mosque, built (1719 A.D.) by Shuj\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, the Orissa Deputy of the Naw\u00e1b Murshid Kul\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, and endowed by him with a grant of 60 acres of land. Every morning and evening, the people of the neighbourhood, Hindus as well as Muhammadans, offer homage at the shrine.\n\n**Alamg\u00edrnagar.**\u2014An ancient fort, which once commanded the mouth of the Meghna river; it long formed a pirate stronghold, but was stormed and taken from the Arakanese by the Mughals under Husain Beg, the general of Naw\u00e1b Sha\u00edst\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n, in 1664\u201365 A.D.\n\n**Alamnagar.**\u2014Village in Bh\u00e1galpur District, Bengal, situated in lat. 25\u00b0 33' 45\" N., long. 86\u00b0 56' 21\" E., about 7 miles south-west of Kishenganj. This was once the principal village of a powerful Chandel family, which at one time possessed fifty two adjacent townships, and enjoyed a considerable revenue. The estate, however, was squandered away, and at present only two villages remain to the family. Ruins of fine tanks, earthenware ramparts of forts, and of a large family residence, alone remain to show the former wealth of the owners. The prevailing castes are R\u00e1jputs and Br\u00e1hmans.\n\n**Alamnagar.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in tahsil Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, Hardoi District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Kheri District, on the east by Pih\u00e1n\u00ed, on the south by North Sara, and on the west by Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d pargan\u00e1. This part of the country appears to have been held originally by the Thatheras, until, at some uncertain period in the later days of Hindu\ndominion, a band of Gaur Kshattriyas crossed the Ganges from Kanauj and drove them out. Shortly before the fall of Kanauj, the Nikumbhs obtained a footing in the *pargan\u00e1*, and occupied the country side by side with the Gaurs, until the latter, in the reign of Akbar, grew rebellious, and were expelled by Naw\u00e1b Sadar Jah\u00e1n, the illustrious founder of the line of Pih\u00e1n\u00ed Sayyids. The fortunes of the Nikumbhs fell before the rising power of the Sayyids. Village after village was wrested from them, until at length the last of their possessions passed into the hands of the Sayyids, who named the *pargan\u00e1* Alamnagar, after the then reigning Emperor Alamgir I. (Aurangzeb). The Nikumbhs did not recover their position until about a hundred years ago, when the Naw\u00e1b Asaf-ud-daul\u00e1 resumed the revenue-free domain of the Pih\u00e1n\u00ed and Muhamdi Sayyids, and bestowed it upon the depressed Nikumbhs and Gaurs, who had thus an opportunity of again engaging for a portion of their lost possessions. Area of the *pargan\u00e1*, 59 square miles, of which only nineteen in the middle of the tract are cultivated. On the east and west are almost unbroken belts of *dh\u00e1k* and thorn jungle, teeming with game. Government land revenue demand, \u00a32451, at the rate of 1s. 3\u00bdd. per acre of area. Population (1881) 18,282. Average density of population, 309 per square mile. The village of Alamnagar consists of a cluster of 76 houses with a population of 545 in 1881.\n\n**Alamnagar - Thomsonganj.** \u2014 Town in S\u00edt\u00e1pur District, Oudh. Population (1881) 7984; namely Hindus, 5527; Muhammadans, 2312; Jain, 1; Christians, 71; \u2018others,\u2019 73. Area of town site, 38 acres.\n\n**Alamparai,** \u2014 Village in Chengalpat (Chingleput) District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 12\u00b0 16\u2032 N., long. 80\u00b0 3\u2032 E. Situated on the coast, on the southern confines of the Chingleput District, about midway between Pondicherry and Chingleput town. It was granted to Dupleix by Muzaffar Jang, the Subahd\u00e1r of the Deccan, in 1750, and was the scene of many events during the struggle between the French and English. In 1758, a severe naval engagement between the squadrons of these nations was fought opposite the village. It was a French d\u00e9p\u00f4t and fort during the siege of Madras, and was captured by Sir Eyre Coote in 1760. Formerly famous for its oyster-beds.\n\n**Alampur.** \u2014 Petty State of Gohelw\u00e1r, in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency. Consists of one village.

Police outpost station; village school; market twice a week. The town is named after Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, the last Emperor of the Sayyid dynasty, who is said to have founded it after his abdication of the throne of Delhi and retirement to Bud\u00e1un, 1450 A.D. The estate within which the town lies has been held for ages by S\u00e1raswati Br\u00e1hmans, who claim to have obtained it from Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn.\n\n**Alatt\u00far (Elatt\u00far).** \u2014 Town in Malab\u00e1r District, Madras Presidency.

It is held in honour of Krishna every year on the occasion of a Hindu religious festival (R\u00e1spurnim\u00e1), celebrated in October or November. The god is worshipped by the devotees with offerings of dried rice, and hence the name. The fair lasts from eight to fifteen days, and is attended by about 75,000 or 80,000 persons. A considerable trade is carried on here at this time.\n\n**Al\u00e1walpur.** \u2014 Town in Kart\u00e1rpur tahsil, Jalandhar (Jullundur) District, Punjab. Lat. $31^\\circ 26'$ N., long. $75^\\circ 42'$ E. Population (1881) 3802, comprising 2206 Muhammadans, 578 Hindus, and 18 Sikhs. Third-class municipality.

This pargan\u00e1 appears to have been originally in the hands of the Bhars; and local tradition asserts that a prominent Bhar chieftain, named Alde, built a fort and city on the high left bank of the G\u00famti, the ruins of which still exist, and which gave its name to the pargan\u00e1. The only traces of Bhar occupation now visible consist of numerous old forts and ruined towns. Several settlements of Hindus were made during the Bhar period. As the Muhammadan power in Oudh became gradually consolidated, the Bhar supremacy languished, and ultimately the aboriginal race entirely lost their footing. The principal Hindu tribes who have settled here are the Sakarw\u00e1rs, Raghubans\u00eds, Ujaini\u00e1s, Bais, P\u00e1ndes, K\u00farm\u00eds, and R\u00e1jkum\u00e1rs. The R\u00e1jkum\u00e1rs are the latest arrivals, but they soon became the most powerful, and the rights of other clans rapidly declined until this pargan\u00e1 (among others) may now be considered as the R\u00e1jkum\u00e1rs\u2019 zamind\u00e1ri. The great R\u00e1jkum\u00e1r estates in Aldemau are Der\u00e1, Meopur, N\u00e1n\u00e1mau, and P\u00e1ras-patti. Their chiefs were at deadly feud with each other down to the time of the annexation of Oudh, and much blood has been shed from their jealousies. The pargan\u00e1 contains an area of 349 square miles, or 223,373 acres, of which 112,480 are cultivated. Government land revenue, \u00a320,218, being at the rate of 3s. per acre of arable land. Population (1881), Hindus, 158,446; Muhammadans, 10,046; total, 168,492. Average density of the population, 485 per square mile. Several classes of professional thieves have their home in this pargan\u00e1.\n\nAlengad.\u2014T\u00e1luk in Travancore State, Madras Presidency. Area, 208 square miles. Population (1881) 66,753.\n\nAlguada.\u2014Dangerous reef in the Bay of Bengal, off the coast of Pegu, British Burma. Bearing from Diamond Island, 3\u00bc leagues south-south-west. Lat. 15\u00b0 40\u2032 15\u2033 N., long. 94\u00b0 16\u2032 45\u2033 E. The rocks extend 1\u00bc mile north and south, level with the surface of the sea, and have outlying reefs at some distance. This dangerous spot is known to the Burmese as Nagarit Kyauk, but to the rest of the world by the name given to it by the Portuguese mariners, Alguada. The main reef has a granite lighthouse 144 feet high, with first-class catadioptric light, revolving once in a minute, visible twenty miles. A work of great labour, commenced in 1861, and completed in 1865 under the superintendence of Captain (now Major-General) A. Fraser, C.B. The Alguada reef lies on the submarine volcanic band which stretches from Sumatra to the delta of Bengal.\n\nAli\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Village in Bar\u00e1 Banki District, Oudh; about 30 miles east of Bar\u00e1 Banki town, on the road from Dary\u00e1b\u00e1d to Rudaul\u00ed. Lat. 26\u00b0 51\u2032 N., long. 81\u00b0 41\u2032 E.; population (1881) 1883. Formerly celebrated for its looms, and a considerable seat of the cloth trade; now declined owing to competition of English goods. Inhabitants principally weavers.\nAlib\u00e1gh.\u2014Sub-division of Kol\u00e1ba (Colaba) District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 194 square miles; contains 3 towns and 169 villages. Population (1881) 76,138, of whom 38,355 were returned as males, and 37,783 as females. Hindus numbered 72,476; Muhammadans, 2119; and \u2018others,\u2019 1543.\n\nAlib\u00e1gh.\u2014Chief town of Kol\u00e1ba District, and head-quarters of the Sub-division of Alib\u00e1gh, Bombay Presidency; 19 miles south of Bombay. Lat. 18\u00b0 38' 55\" N., long. 72\u00b0 54' 50\" E. Alib\u00e1gh was named after a rich Muhammadan, who lived about two centuries ago, and who constructed several wells and gardens in and near the town, many of which still exist. On entering the harbour, the buildings of the town are hid from view by a belt of cocoa-nut trees. The only object of mark is the Kol\u00e1ba fort,\u2014on a small rocky island, about one-eighth of a mile from the shore,\u2014once a stronghold of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 pirate-captain Angri\u00e1. (See Kolaba District.) About 2 miles out at sea, to the south-west of the Kol\u00e1ba Fort, a round tower, about 60 feet high, marks a dangerous reef, covered at high water, on which several vessels have been wrecked. Population (1881) 6376; namely, Hindus, 5674; Muhammadans, 407; Jains, 66; Christians, 55; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 2; \u2018others,\u2019 172. Municipal revenue (1881), \u00a31076; rate of taxation, 2s. 6d. per head; municipal expenditure, \u00a3652. The town is supplied with drinking water from a lake, recently made, distant about a mile and a half to the north-east, on the road to Dharamtar, and contains a sub-judge\u2019s court, a customs house, hospital, jail, schools, and a post-office. The gardens of Alib\u00e1gh, which yield cocoa-nuts and some fine varieties of graft mangoes, are among the best in the District. Average annual value of trade at the port of Alib\u00e1gh, for five years ending 1881-82:\u2014Exports, \u00a314,224; imports, \u00a320,263.\n\n\u00c1li Bandar.\u2014Small town on the Gonni river, in Tando Muhammad Kh\u00e1n Sub-division, Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 24\u00b0 22' N., long. 69\u00b0 11' E. Remarkable as the site of a dam, \u2018the only work of public utility ever made by the Talpur dynasty,\u2019 which, however, by causing the deposit of silt above the town, cut off its water communication with Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d. The channel below the town, once a main estuary of the Indus, dried up from the same reason, and the District of Saira (formerly remarkable for fertility) became a part of the Rann, or Great Salt Waste of Cutch (Kachchh).\n\n\u00c1liganj.\u2014Tahsil or Sub-division of Etah District, North-Western Provinces. Lies between the Ganges and the K\u00e1li Nadi, intersected by the Burh Gang\u00e1 and Fatehgarh branch of the Lower Ganges Canal. It comprises the four minor fiscal divisions (parg\u00e1ns) of Azamnagar, Barna, Pati\u00e1li, and Nidhpur. Area, 525 square miles, of which 352 are cultivated. Population (1881) 186,364; land revenue, \u00a324,279; total revenue, \u00a327,421; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a359,380. In\n1883, the tahsil contained one magisterial court, with four th\u00e1n\u00e1s or police circles. The regular police force numbered 65 men; town police, 58; and village watch or rural police, 411 men.\n\nAl\u00edganj.\u2014Town in Etah District, North-Western Provinces; 32 miles north-west of Fatehgarh. Lat. 27\u00b0 29' 20\" N., long. 79\u00b0 12' 40\" E. Population (1881) 7436, comprising 4787 Hindus, 2411 Muhammadans, 237 Jains, and 1 Christian; area, 96 acres. Rather a large agricultural village than a town. A wide metalled road, containing the principal b\u00e1z\u00e1r, runs through the town from north to south, crossed by another metalled road at right angles. The shops are, for the most part, built of mud, but there are a few large brick-built houses, the residences of the wealthier traders. Police station, post-office, large clean sarai or native inn. Chief trade\u2014grain, indigo-seed, and cotton. Tri-weekly market. The town contains two unpretending mosques and a large mud fort, constructed in 1747 by Y\u00e1kut Kh\u00e1n, a Muhammadan convert, whose family are still the principal landowners. Municipal income in 1880\u201381, \u00a3340, chiefly from octroi dues; expenditure, \u00a3283; incidence of municipal taxation, 1\u00bdd. per head of population within municipal limits.\n\nAl\u00edganj.\u2014Village in Kheri District, Oudh. Lat. 28\u00b0 9' N., long. 80\u00b0 40' E. Population (1881) 117c; namely, Hindus 932, and Muhammadans 238. Bi-weekly market. Ruins of old mud fort.\n\nAl\u00edganj Sew\u00e1n.\u2014Town in S\u00e1ran District, Bengal, and headquarters of the Sew\u00e1n Sub-division. Lat. 26\u00b0 13' 23\" N., long. 84\u00b0 23' 43\" E. Population (1881) 13,307; namely, Hindus, 8115; Muhammadans, 5184; Christians, 8. The place is noted for the manufacture of superior pottery (red and black glazed, as well as unglazed and porous), brass vessels, and chintzes. Boats can come up the river D\u00e1h\u00e1, on which the town is situated, at all seasons. Distance from Chhapr\u00e1, 40 miles; from Dinapur, 54. Municipal income in 1881\u201382, \u00a3523.\n\nAl\u00edgarh.\u2014District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, lying between 27\u00b0 28' 30\" and 28\u00b0 10' N. lat., and between 77\u00b0 31' 15\" and 78\u00b0 41' 15\" E. long. Area, 1955 square miles. Population (1881) 1,021,187. Al\u00edgarh is the southernmost District of the Meerut (Mirath) Division, and is bounded on the north by Bulandshahr District; on the east by Etah; on the south by Muttra District; and on the west by Muttra District and by the river Jumna (Jamun\u00e1). The administrative head-quarters are at the civil station of Al\u00edgarh, adjoining the town of Koil (Koel).\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Al\u00edgarh forms a portion of the great alluvial plain lying between the Ganges and the Jumna, and known accordingly as the Do\u00e1b. Its surface is one broad unbroken level, having a general elevation of about 600 feet above the sea, with a slight slope toward the south-east. On either side, it dips down abruptly into the hollow\nvalleys of the two great rivers, which flow at a depth of about 60 feet below the central plateau. The watershed between them is composed of a low sandy ridge, along whose summit the course of the Ganges Canal has been carried. That magnificent work passes almost through the centre of the District from north to south, and distributes its waters by minor channels to the thirsty plain on either hand. Near the town of Akr\u00e1bad it divides into two terminal branches, which severally run to Cawnpur and to Et\u00e1wah. Under the influence of this great fertilizing agent, the plain of Al\u00edgarh presents, in the cool season, an almost uninterrupted sea of green and smiling cultivation, interspersed with numerous flourishing villages. The jungle, which covered a large portion of the District at the commencement of the British occupation, is rapidly disappearing; and, with the spread of tillage, the country is now being denuded of trees. The total area under groves, such as mango and other fruit trees, etc., is only 5676 acres. There are few Districts which present such a bare appearance, and none where more efforts should be made to induce the people to plant trees. This has been partially attained by the Government allowing a remission of revenue for land under groves, and a considerable extension of tree plantations is anticipated. The principal plantation trees are nim, mango, j\u00e1mun, pipal, bab\u00fal, mahu\u00e1, far\u00fas, and ber. S\u00e1l, and the better sorts of timber for building purposes, are imported. The soil throughout the District may be said to consist of a rich fertile loam, which becomes much indurated wherever it comes into constant contact with water; whilst here and there are large tracts of sandy soil. To the north-east, the land bordering the Ganges possesses a more or less sandy soil. To the west, along the high bank of the Jumna, the soil is sandy for a few miles, but then comes pure loam, with occasional hillocks or high ridges of sand. In the north of the District, the eastern tracts are inferior to the western, and neither are so fertile as the tracts to the south. The substratum is entirely kankar, or nodular limestone, which is found everywhere a few feet below the surface, and in several places crops out. It is used for building purposes, and in the form of coarse gravel for metalling roads. On the higher grounds, which sever the small streams from one another, extensive patches of barren land occur, known by the name of \u00fasar. They are caused by the efflorescence of a noxious salt, called by the natives reh, and no plant or weed will grow upon the soil which it covers. It forms a white crust on the ground, and the spots on which it has gathered stand out upon the landscape glistening white in the sun, like snow on a bright winter's day in more northern climates. Unfortunately the spread of irrigation seems to have contributed to its increase, as the water, which percolates the earth, brings this deleterious saline substance to the surface. The Ganges marks the boundary line in the north-east\ncorner of the District, and the Jumna runs along the western frontier for about 16 miles. The two main rivers are bordered by strips of lowland, largely used for grazing; and the Ganges shifts its channel from time to time, thereby exposing fresh alluvial tracts, whose deep deposits of decaying vegetable matter render them singularly fertile. The minor rivers and streams are the following:\u2014The K\u00e1li Nad\u00ed, which flows through the District from north-west to south-east, into Etah District. Largely used for irrigation, and also affords an escape for the excess water of the canals. The river is bridged at the eleventh mile on the road from Al\u00edgarh to Morad\u00e1b\u00e1d, where in high flood the river has a breadth of 187 feet, and a depth of 14 feet; and in the hot season a breadth of 30 feet, and a depth of 8 feet. It is also bridged at the twenty-second mile on the Al\u00edgarh and K\u00e1sganj road, where the stream has a width of 250 feet and a depth of $14\\frac{1}{2}$ feet in seasons of flood, and a width of 60 feet and a depth of $5\\frac{1}{2}$ feet in the hot season. The N\u00edm Nad\u00ed also flows through the north-east of the District, and eventually falls into the K\u00e1li Nad\u00ed. It is bridged at Malsai and Bhikampur, and its waters are largely used for irrigation. The river has a breadth of 200 feet, and a depth of 8 feet in the rains. The Karon Nadi, Isan, Sengar, and Rind are minor streams, which, though of considerable breadth and depth, are, as a rule, dry in the hot and cold weather. The Ganges Canal enters Al\u00edgarh from Bulandshahr District on the north, and flows in a generally straight south-easterly direction into Etah District, and ultimately joins the Ganges at Cawnpur. From Akr\u00e1b\u00e1d, a branch canal is thrown off to the south, but afterwards turns eastwards, and runs parallel to the main canal at a distance of about 5 miles, also into Etah District, after which it again turns southward and joins the Jumna in Et\u00e1wah District. To a general view, the plain of Al\u00edgarh displays one of the most fruitful and prosperous tracts of the Upper Doab.\n\nHistory.\u2014The few facts in the early annals of the District which can now be recovered centre around the ancient city of Koil, of which the fort and station of Al\u00edgarh form a suburb. A popular legend informs us that Koil owes its origin to one Kosh\u00e1rab, a Kshattriya of the Lunar race, who called the city after his own name; and that its present designation was conferred upon it by Balar\u00e1m, who slew here the great demon Kol, and subdued the neighbouring regions of the Do\u00e1b. Another tradition assigns a totally different origin to the name. The District was held by the Dor R\u00e1jputs before the first Muhammadan invasion, and continued in the hands of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Baran until the close of the 12th century. In 1194 A.D. Kutab-ud-d\u00edn marched from Delhi to Koil, on which occasion, as the Muhammadan historian informs us, \u2018those who were wise and acute were converted to Isl\u00e1m, but those who stood by their ancient faith were slain with the sword.\u2019 The city was thenceforward administered\nby Musalm\u00e1n governors, but the native R\u00e1j\u00e1s retained much of their original power. The District suffered during the invasion of Tim\u00far in the 14th century, and participated in the general misfortunes which marked the transitional period of the 15th. After the capture of Delhi by the Mughals, B\u00e1bar appointed his follower, Kachak Ali, governor of Koil (1526); and in the reign of Akbar, the town and District were organized on the general scheme by which that great Emperor endeavoured to consolidate and unify his wide dominions. Many mosques and other monuments still remain, attesting the power and piety of Musalm\u00e1n rulers during the palmy days of the Mughal dynasty. The period was marked, here as elsewhere, by strenuous and successful proselytizing efforts on the part of the dominant religion. But after the death of Aurangzeb, the District fell a prey to the contending hordes who ravaged the fertile stretches of the Do\u00e1b. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s were the first in the field, and they were closely followed by the J\u00e1ts. About the year 1757, Suraj Mall, a J\u00e1t leader, took possession of Koil, the central position of which, on the roads from Muttra and Agra to Delhi and Rohilkhand, made it a post of great military importance. The J\u00e1ts in turn were shortly afterwards ousted by the Afgh\u00e1ns (1759), and for the next twenty years the District became a battle-field for the two contending races. The various conquests and reconquests which it underwent had no permanent effects, until the occupation by Sindhia took place in 1784. The District remained in the hands of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s until 1803, with the exception of a few months, during which a Rohill\u00e1 garrison was placed in the fort of Al\u00edgarh by Ghul\u00e1m K\u00e1dir Kh\u00e1n. Al\u00edgarh became a fortress of great importance under its Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 master; and was the d\u00e9p\u00f4t where Sindhia drilled and organized his battalions in the European fashion, with the aid of De Boigne. When, in 1802, the triple alliance between Holkar, Sindhia, and the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of N\u00e1gpur was directed against the British, the Niz\u00e1m, and the Peshw\u00e1, Al\u00edgarh was under the command of Sindhia\u2019s famous partisan leader, Perron, while the British frontier had already advanced to within 15 miles of Koil. Perron undertook the management of the campaign; but he was feebly seconded by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 chieftains, who waited, in the ordinary Indian fashion, until circumstances should decide which of the two parties it would prove most to their interest to espouse. In August 1803, a British force under Lord Lake advanced upon Al\u00edgarh, and was met by Perron at the frontier. The enemy did not wait after the first round of grape from the British artillery, and Perron fled precipitately from the field. Shortly after, he surrendered himself to Lord Lake, leaving the fort of Al\u00edgarh still in the possession of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 troops, under the command of another European leader. On the 4th September, the British moved forward to the assault; but they found the fortifications\nplanned with the experience and skill of French engineers, and desperately defended with true Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 obstinacy. It was only after a most intrepid attack, and an equally vigorous resistance, that the fortress, considered impregnable by the natives, was carried by the British assault; and with it fell the whole of the Upper Do\u00e1b to the very foot of the Siw\u00e1liks. The organization of the conquered territory into British Districts was undertaken at once. After a short period, during which the pargan\u00e1s now composing the District of Al\u00edgarh were distributed between Fatehgarh and Et\u00e1wah, the nucleus of the present District was separated, in 1804. Scarcely had it been formed when the war with Holkar broke out; and his emissaries stirred up the discontented revenue-farmers, who had made fortunes by unscrupulous oppression under the late Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 rule, to rise in rebellion against the new Government. This insurrection was promptly suppressed (1805). A second revolt, however, occurred in the succeeding year; and its ringleaders were only driven out after a severe assault upon their fortress of Kamon\u00e1. Other disturbances with the revenue-farmers arose in 1816, and it became necessary to dismantle their forts. The peace of the District was not again interrupted until the outbreak of the Mutiny. News of the Meerut revolt reached Koil on the 12th May 1857, and was here followed by the mutiny of the native troops quartered at Al\u00edgarh, and the rising of the rabble. The Europeans escaped with their lives, but the usual plunderings and burnings took place. Until the 2nd July, the factory of Mandrak was gallantly held by a small body of volunteers in the face of an overwhelming rabble, but it was then abandoned, and the District fell into the hands of the rebels. A native committee of safety was formed to preserve the city of Koil from plunder, but the Musalm\u00e1n mob ousted them, and one Nas\u00edm-ull\u00e1 took upon himself the task of government. His excesses alienated the Hindu population, and made them more ready to side with the British on their return. The old J\u00e1t and R\u00e1jput feuds broke out meanwhile with their accustomed fury; and, indeed, the people indulged in far worse excesses towards one another than towards the Europeans. On the 24th August a small British force moved upon Koil, when the rebels were easily defeated, and abandoned the town. Various other bodies of insurgents afterwards passed through on several occasions, but the District remained substantially in our possession; and by the end of 1857, the rebels had been completely expelled from the Do\u00e1b. With that episode the history of Aligarh fortunately closes.\n\nPopulation.\u2014An enumeration in 1853 returned the total inhabitants at 1,134,565. The population in 1872, according to the Census of that year, but allowing for some trifling changes of area, amounted to 1,073,256. The latest Census in 1881 returned a total population of 1,021,157 (on an area of 1955 square miles), showing a decrease of\n52,069 or 4.8 per cent. in the nine years. The male population in 1881 numbered 551,279, and the female 469,908; proportion of males in total population, 54 per cent. Average density of population, 522 per square mile; number of towns and villages, 1743; number of occupied houses, 124,573; number of villages per square mile, 89; houses per square mile, 63.7; inmates per house, 8.1. As regards the religious distinctions of the people, 901,144, or 88.2 per cent., were returned as Hindus, and 117,339, or 11.5 per cent., as Muhammadans. There were also 2377 Jains, 26 Sikhs, 289 Christians, and 10 Parsis.\n\nOf the four great classes into which the Hindus are divided, the Br\u0101hmans numbered as many as 136,664 souls. They are chiefly landowners. The R\u0101jputs amounted to 75,841, amongst whom the J\u00e1d\u00fans and Chauh\u00e1ns are the most numerous. They are also landholders. The Baniy\u00e1s, or trading classes, are returned as 50,817 souls. They are a wealthy body, chiefly absenteees, who follow their trades as money-lenders and brokers in the larger towns. The Cham\u00e1rs are the most numerous amongst the low castes, amounting to 172,451 persons, or 16.9 per cent. of the whole population; but they are generally poor, almost serfs of the proprietor, and tied by debt to the soil, with which they were transferred by custom. The J\u00e1ts come next in number, with 83,605 souls, and rank far the first in social and political importance, from the industry with which they cultivate their villages. They have a hereditary feud with the R\u00e1jputs, and the two tribes will not inhabit the same villages. Gadari\u00e1s, or shepherds, number 31,906; Lodh\u00eds, 37,331; Kol\u00eds, 29,521; K\u00e1chhis, 23,618; Kah\u00e1rs, 26,445; and Ah\u00edrs, 12,099. There were 42 native Christians in the District in 1881. Seven towns had populations exceeding 4000 souls\u2014namely, Tappal, 4712; Jalali, 4939; Harduaganj, 4520; Sikandra Rao, 10,193; Atrauli, 14,374; Hathras, 25,656; and Koil (with Aligarh), 61,730. These figures show an urban population amounting to 126,124 souls, leaving a rural body of 895,033. Of the total of 1743 towns and villages, 456 contained less than two hundred inhabitants in 1881; 708 from two to five hundred; 379 from five hundred to a thousand; 153 from one to two thousand; 22 from two to three thousand; 21 from three to five thousand; 2 from ten to fifteen thousand; 1 from twenty to fifty thousand; and 1 with over fifty thousand inhabitants. The northern half of the District abounds with the ruins of old forts. The language of the peasantry is Hind\u00ed, tinged in the south with the Braj dialect, but the better classes speak the Urdu of Delhi. As regards occupation, the Census Report returns the male population under six main heads, as follows:\u2014Class (1) Professional, including civil and military and the learned professions, 11,131; (2) domestic servants, lodging-house keepers, etc., 2183; (3) commercial class, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 13,497;\n(4) agricultural class, including cultivators, gardeners, tenders of sheep and cattle, etc., 198,620; (5) industrial, including manufacturers, artisans, etc., 91,642; (6) indefinite and non-productive (being 52,291 general labourers and 182,115 male children or persons of unspecified occupation), 234,406.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Almost all the cultivable land in Aligarh is under tillage, only 12 per cent. of the available area, or 121,168 acres, being returned as cultivable waste, while 88 per cent., or 897,172 acres, is reported as being under cultivation. The area of uncultivable waste is returned at about 208,000 acres. The greater portion of the cultivable land still available consists of wide tracts of poor sand and alluvial khadir near the banks of the great rivers in the northern divisions of Atrauli and Khair. The area under grass for pasturage is very restricted. The few wide uncultivated pasture lands in Atrauli and Khair must sooner or later come under the plough, and in a short time cultivation will have reached its limit in this District, where even now the pressure of the population on the soil is severely felt. Aligarh has in many places two, and in some three, harvests a year. The principal products are wheat (182,045 acres), barley (93,463 acres), jo\u00e1r (159,106 acres), and bajra (70,405 acres). The cultivation of cotton has largely increased of late years, and the returns show 119,715 acres employed for that purpose, while indigo, another rising staple, is grown on 29,013 acres. Of the total cultivated area, 433,516 acres, or 48\u00b73 per cent., are under kharif, or rain crops, of an estimated total value of \u00a3826,564, and 450,946 acres, or 50\u00b73 per cent., are under rab\u00ed, or cold-weather crops of a total estimated value of \u00a31,245,511. Estimated grand total value of both kharif and rab\u00ed crops \u00a32,072,075. The average out-turn of cotton is 2 maunds, or 1 cwt. 1 qr. 24 lbs., per acre; value on the field, \u00a32, 4s.: while wheat produces about 17 maunds 20 sers, or 12 cwts. 3 qrs. 6 lbs., per acre; value on the field, \u00a32, 16s. Irrigation is widely practised, as many as 648,017 acres, or 72\u00b73 per cent. of the cultivated area, being artificially supplied with water in 1875, while only 248,357 acres, or 27\u00b77 per cent., were dependent upon the precarious rainfall. Canals afforded water to 114,406 acres, and 524,406 acres were irrigated from wells, the residue of 10,005 acres being supplied from tanks. The main line of the Ganges Canal has a length of 48\u00b762 miles within the District; and from it 269 miles of greater distributaries, 49 miles of lesser distributaries, and 487 miles of small channels draw their supplies. The people are fairly well off. Besides the ordinary tenures by zamind\u00e1ri, pattid\u00e1ri, and bh\u00e1y\u00e1ch\u00e1ra, there is another known as t\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri, by which the minor proprietors are responsible for their share of the revenue to a superior holder, called a t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r, the latter being in his turn responsible to Government for the whole revenue of his subordinates, on which he\nreceives a fixed percentage. This tenure has grown up through some confusion at the early settlements between the actual possession of land and the responsibility of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 revenue-farmers for the taxes of the country farmed by them. Most of the District is cultivated by tenants-at-will; only 29 per cent. of the area is held by tenants with rights of occupancy. Rents are chiefly paid in cash, and vary much with the means of communication and irrigation. Good irrigated lands in the best situations let at \u00a31, 2s. 7d. an acre, but the same class of soil without artificial water-supply, rents at only 10s. 6d. an acre. Outlying dry lands are rated at from 3s. 3d. to 6s. an acre. Wages ruled as follows in 1875:\u2014Blacksmiths, carpenters, masons, 7\u00bdd. per diem; labourers, 3\u00bcd. to 4\u00bdd.; coolies, 3d.; women, 2\u00bcd.; boys, 1\u00bed. Agricultural labourers obtained 3d. a day and 1 lb. of bread. Food-stuffs have risen steadily in price of late years. In 1870, wheat was 18\u00bd sers the rupee, or 6s. 0\u00bed. per cwt.; barley, 28\u00bd sers the rupee, or 3s. 11\u00bdd. per cwt.; and jo\u00e1r, 26\u00be sers the rupee, or 4s. 2\u00bcd. per cwt. Prices in Al\u00edgarh District for 1882 are returned as follow: wheat, 20\u00bd sers or 41 lbs. the rupee; barley, 27 sers or 54 lbs. the rupee; jo\u00e1r (large millet), 24 sers or 48 lbs. the rupee; rice, 14 sers or 28 lbs. the rupee; b\u00e1jra (common millet), 22\u00bd sers or 45 lbs. the rupee; gram (pease), 21\u00bd sers or 43 lbs. the rupee.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014The District of Al\u00edgarh is comparatively free from the danger of famine, owing to the prevalence of irrigation, more especially through the instrumentality of the great Ganges Canal. Famines often occurred before the opening of that important work; the most severe one in the present century was due to the drought of 1837. The District shared the unfortunate season of 1868\u201369 with neighbouring tracts, and the result was dearth and scarcity; but actual famine was averted by the influence of the Ganges Canal, and large quantities of grain were exported to less favoured regions. The inestimable value of the canal was thoroughly tested on that occasion, as Aligarh, which formerly used itself to suffer from want of food, was enabled not only to supply its own needs, but also to relieve the pressing necessities of the Punjab and the Native States to the south. Prices rose very high during the scarcity, but the market was ruled by the demand for increased exports rather than by any danger of local distress. Prices were at their highest in December 1868, when wheat was selling at 8\u00bc sers per rupee, or 13s. 6d. per cwt., and jo\u00e1r, the ordinary food of the poorer classes, at 11 sers per rupee, or 10s. 2d. per cwt.\n\nCommerce and trade, etc.\u2014The principal articles of export from Al\u00edgarh are grain, cotton, and indigo. The principal grain marts are H\u00e1thras, Koil, Atrauli, Sikandra R\u00e1o, and Harduaganj. Allowing for food and seed requirements, it is estimated that an average of\n1,354,451 maunds or 991,651 cwts. is available as food for cattle, for reserve store, and for exportation. Nearly all the kharif grain crops, except pulses, are consumed locally, and the exports are confined to wheat, barley, bajra, and gram, which are cold weather (rab\u00ed) crops, and to pulses. Cotton cultivation has increased to such an extent of late years, as to make it one of the characteristic products of the District. About 212,603 maunds, or 156,198 cwts., of cotton are estimated as the average annual amount which is left for exportation, after all the needs of home consumption have been supplied. The indigo trade is also flourishing and important, the District being studded with factories, which numbered 171 in 1873, and produced 3625 maunds, or 2663 cwts., of the marketable dye. There has been an extraordinary increase in the cultivation of indigo by natives during the past fifteen years. Oil-seeds and saltpetre form other important items in the export trade. The imports consist of sugar, rice, Manchester goods, spices, metals, tobacco, timber, and manufactured articles generally. H\u00e1thras is the chief centre of trade, but Koil has also an extensive commerce. Excluding the five municipal towns of Koil, H\u00e1thras, Atrauli, Sikandra R\u00e1o, and Harduaganj, there are 180 markets in the District, or one to about every 10 villages. Cattle, grain, country cloth, vegetables, sweetmeats, toys, brass utensils, and petty articles of domestic consumption are the chief commodities. Religious-trading fairs are held on the occasions of Hindu festivals, and by Muhammadans during the period of the Muharram. The means of communication in Aligarh District are excellent, and new routes are in progress or under consideration. The East Indian Railway crosses the District from north to south, with stations at Somna, Aligarh (Koil), P\u00e1li, and H\u00e1thras road. The Oudh and Rohilkhand line diverges from the East Indian at Al\u00edgarh, and runs north-east, with stations at R\u00e1mpur (for Harduaganj) and R\u00e1ipur (for Atrauli). A new State line of railway on the narrow gauge was opened in 1880, starting from the H\u00e1thras road station of the East Indian Railway to Muttra, a distance of 29 miles, of which 15 lie within Al\u00edgarh District, with stations at H\u00e1thras city and Murs\u00e1n. The Ganges Canal is also largely employed for through traffic. The Grand Trunk Road enters the District at its south-east corner, and proceeds by Sikandra R\u00e1o, Koil, and Somna, into Bulandshahr District, where one branch leads to Delhi, and another to Meerut. Its total length in Aligarh District is 49\u00bd miles. There are 229 miles of first-class roads in the District, most of which are metalled and bridged; and in addition to these, the chief villages, marts, and police stations are connected by a network of cross-country roads, 90 miles being second class, and 182 third. The District contains a remarkable native association, the Al\u00edgarh Institute and Scientific Society, founded in 1864 by Naw\u00e1b\nSayyid Ahmad Kh\u00e1n, C.S.I. Its main object is the translation into the vernacular language of modern scientific and historical works. It possesses a library of 2000 volumes, and a reading-room for English and native papers. A journal is published twice a week in connection with the society, known as the Aligarh Institute Gazette; printed in English and Urdu. Two other newspapers were printed at Al\u00edgarh in 1881, the Bharat Bandu, a weekly; and the Dharma Sam\u00e1j Patr, a monthly journal. A periodical called the Tas\u00e1n\u00edl-i-Ahm\u00e1di, is also published in connection with the Aligarh Institute, and there are two private presses.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1860, the revenue from all sources amounted to \u00a3197,837, of which \u00a3178,299, or 90\u00b712 per cent. of the total, was contributed by the land tax. At the same date, the expenditure amounted to \u00a352,146, or little more than one-fourth of the revenue. In 1870, the total receipts had risen to \u00a3223,709, of which \u00a3196,655, or 87\u00b790 per cent. of the whole sum, was contributed by the land tax. At the same time the expenditure had decreased to \u00a343,472, or less than one-fifth of the revenue. In 1880\u201381, the gross revenue of the District had risen to \u00a3250,606, of which \u00a3213,403, or 85\u00b714 per cent., were derived from the land. The total cost of officials and police of all kinds in the same year, was \u00a337,781. The principal items of receipt, exclusive of land tax, are judicial charges, and stamps. The last land settlement was made in 1871\u201373, and will remain in force until 1901. The District is administered by a Magistrate-Collector and his Assistant, with about five or six Deputy Collectors, about as many tahsild\u00e1rs, and six Honorary Magistrates. There were four muns\u00edfs, besides the Judge of Al\u00edgarh. Twenty magisterial and 22 civil and revenue courts were held in the District in 1880\u201381. The regular District police numbered 489 men in 1881, besides 532 employed in towns and municipalities; total, 1021 officers and men, maintained at a total cost of \u00a310,035, of which \u00a36814 was paid from provincial, and \u00a33221 from local sources. There was also a rural or village police numbering 1999. The total machinery for the protection of persons and property consisted, therefore, of 3020 men of all ranks, giving an average of one man to every 0\u00b761 square mile and to every 3274 inhabitants. Al\u00edgarh is infested by a clan of gipsy-like vagrants, known as Hab\u00faras, whose sole profession is thieving, and who give much trouble to the police authorities. A single jail suffices for the criminal population of the District; the average number of prisoners was 562 in 1850, 481 in 1860, 470 in 1870, and 496 in 1881. In 1860, the number of convicts admitted was 1660; in 1870, 1260; and in 1881, 1482. Education is rapidly spreading, both in the higher and lower departments. The number of schools, aided and unaided, in 1860 was 427, and the children under instruction were returned as\n4964; while the cost of maintenance amounted to \u00a32314. In 1871 the number of aided schools had decreased to 370, but their pupils had risen to 7941; while the expenditure on education had increased to \u00a35426. The total number of Government-inspected schools in 1880 was 221, attended by 6722 pupils. This is exclusive of unaided and uninspected private schools, for which I have been unable to obtain any returns for 1880, but which probably make up the total of schools and pupils to double the figures given above. The Census Report of 1881, however, returned 8834 boys and 144 girls under instruction in that year; besides 25,706 males and 388 females able to read and write but not under instruction. The District is subdivided into six tahsils and fourteen parganas, with an aggregate in 1874 of 2045 estates, owned by 27,175 registered proprietors or coparceners; the average land revenue from each estate amounted to \u00a3100, 2s. 2\u00bdd., and from each proprietor, to \u00a37, 10s. 9d. There are five municipal towns, Koil (including Aligarh), Harduaganj, Sikandra Rao, Atrauli, and Hathras (qq.v.). In 1880\u201381, their united revenue amounted to \u00a39803, of which \u00a38064 was derived from octroi dues; their joint expenditure was \u00a38579. The incidence of municipal taxation was at the rate of 1s. 8\u00bdd. per head of their population.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Aligarh is that of the Doab plain generally. The year is divided into\u2014the rainy season, from June till October; the cool season, from October till April; and the hot season, from April till June. The mean temperature of three daily observations in 1880 was as follows:\u2014January 53\u00b05 F., February 65\u00b02, March 76\u00b06, April 80\u00b03, May 90\u00b03, June 93\u00b03, July 82\u00b0, August 87\u00b0, September 87\u00b05, October 76\u00b0, November 66\u00b05, December 58\u00b08. The average rainfall for the thirty-five years ending 1881 was 26.24 inches; the maximum being 31 inches in 1863\u201364; and the minimum, 14.3 inches in 1866\u201367. The rainfall in 1881 was 27.70 inches, or 1.46 above the average. The only endemic disease prevailing in the District is a malarious fever; but cholera and typhoid fever occur in an epidemic form, especially during years of scarcity. In 1880, the number of deaths reported was 27,706, or 27.1 per thousand inhabitants; and of these 22,514 were assigned to fever. There are dispensaries at Koil, Hathras, Sikandra Rao, and Khair. Cattle-disease is common, and assumes a virulent form when the rains first set in; the animals gorge themselves with rank grass after the long scarcity of the dry months. Foot-and-mouth disease is also prevalent. [For further information, see The Gazetteer of the North-Western Provinces, vol. ii., by Mr. E. T. Atkinson, C.S. (Allahabad, 1875); Administration Reports of the Government of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, particularly that for 1880\u201381; and the admirable Settlement Report of Aligarh District, by Mr. W. H. Smith, C.S., 1874.]\nAligarh.\u2014Town and administrative head-quarters of Aligarh District, North-Western Provinces, situated in lat. $27^\\circ 55' 41''$ N., long. $78^\\circ 6' 45''$ E.; distant 803 miles north-west from Calcutta, and 84 miles south-east from Delhi; area, 452 acres. Population in 1881 (with the town of Koil), 61,730, comprising 38,253 Hindus, 22,504 Muhammadans, 676 Jains, 264 Christians, and 33 'others.' The fort and civil station of Aligarh adjoin the large native city of Koil, which may be conveniently treated under the same heading. Koil is a handsome and well-situated town, the centre of which is occupied by the high site of an old Dor fortress, now crowned by S\u00e1bit Kh\u00e1n's mosque, a conspicuous object from the surrounding plain. The history of this place has been given under Aligarh District. The fort, 740 feet above the sea level, founded at a much later date than the city, was captured by Lord Lake in 1803. It was held by Perron, the partisan general of Sindhia, but on the first approach of Lord Lake's forces he fled to H\u00e1thras and thence to Muttra. The fort was stormed by the British on the 4th September, and carried after a desperate resistance; with its fall, the whole Upper Do\u00e1b passed into our hands. The place was naturally strong, owing to its position in the midst of large swamps and deep morasses, and it had been fortified with the greatest skill by its French engineers. The native troops at Aligarh joined the Mutiny of 1857, and the town was successively plundered by the Mew\u00e1tis of the neighbouring villages, by the passing rebel soldiery, by Nas\u00edm-ull\u00e1 during his eleven days' rule, and by the British troops. The East Indian Railway has a station here, which is also the junction station with the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway. The post-office workshops for the manufacture of carts, bags, and other postal apparatus, give employment to over 700 workmen. The Aligarh Institute has a library of 2000 volumes and a public reading-room, furnished with the leading English and vernacular journals. Details regarding this institution, and respecting the Aligarh press, have been given under Aligarh District. Public buildings\u2014the courts, Anglo-Oriental college, the Anglo-vernacular schools, jail, and church, also a dispensary and a railway telegraph office. The principal trade is in cotton, for pressing which there are screws, under both European and native management, near the railway station. Manufactures unimportant, except a little pottery. Total municipal revenue in 1880\u201381, \u00a35278, of which \u00a34452 was derived from octroi dues; expenditure, \u00a34704.\n\nAligarh.\u2014Tahsil or sub-division of Farukhabad District, North-Western Provinces, comprising the parganas of Amritpur, Paramnagar, and Kh\u00e1khat-mau; area, 187 square miles, of which 59,611 acres or 93\u00bd square miles are cultivated. Population (1881) 76,085; land revenue, \u00a312,187; total revenue, \u00a313,649; rental paid by cultivators,\n\u00a323,556. The tahsil contains one criminal court, and comprises the two police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s) of Aligarh and Allahganj. Strength of the regular police, 29 men, besides 178 chaukid\u00e1rs or village police.\n\nAl\u00edgarh.\u2014Village in Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d District, and head-quarters of Al\u00edgarh tahsil, situated about a mile west of the Rohilkhand trunk road, 8 miles north-north-east of Fatehgarh town. A small and insignificant village, only noticeable as the site of the tahsil, and containing a first-class police station and an imperial post-office. Market twice a week. The village is stated to be exceptionally unhealthy, owing to the unwholesomeness of its drinking water.\n\nAl\u00edgarh.\u2014The site of a small fort on the west bank of the H\u00fagl\u00ed river, near Garden Reach, 5 miles below Calcutta, which was taken by Lord Clive at the re-capture of Calcutta, on the 30th December 1756. Only the site now remains.\n\nAl\u00edg\u00e1um.\u2014Town in Poona District, Bombay Presidency, on the river Bh\u00edma. Lat. 18\u00b0 35' N., long. 74\u00b0 23' E.; 32 miles east from P\u00fana (Poona).

Population (1881) 384,972, including 259,018 Hindus, 121,458 Muhammadans, 168 Buddhists, 4193 Christians, and 135 'others.' Number of villages, 1017; of houses, 78,106, of which 76,098 are occupied; average number of persons per square mile, 916\u00b760; of villages per square mile, 2\u00b756; and of houses per square mile, 185\u00b797; average number of persons per village, 378; and per house, 5\u00b70. Al\u00edpur has been the head-quarters Sub-division of the District since 1759; it includes the Suburbs of Calcutta, and is divided into the six th\u00e1n\u00e1s, or police circles, of Tollyganj, Bhangor, Son\u00e1rpur, Bishnupur, Atchipur, and Bar\u00e1nagar. In 1882\u201383, it contained 12 Magisterial Courts, and a total police force of 1231 men. Since March 1883, the Sub-division has been increased by the addition of the th\u00e1n\u00e1s of B\u00e1ruipur, Matl\u00e1, and Jainagar, comprising the former Sub-division of B\u00e1ruipur, which was abolished on that date on account of the opening of the Diamond Harbour railway having rendered the Courts at Al\u00edpur more accessible than those at B\u00e1ruipur. Including these additions, the Sub-division now (1883) contains a total area of 862 square miles, with 1825 towns and villages, and 103,600 occupied houses. Total population, 584,460; namely, Hindus, 395,118; Muhammadans, 183,768; Buddhists, 183; Christians, 5135; and 'others,' 259.

Lat. 22\u00b0 31' 50\" N., long. 88\u00b0 24' E. It forms a southern suburb of Calcutta, and contains Belvedere House, the\nresidence of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, and a number of handsome mansions. It lies within the limits of the South Suburban Municipality, and is a cantonment of native troops. The strength of the military force ordinarily stationed at Alipur is as follows:\u2014Small detachment of Bengal Cavalry, one Native Infantry Regiment and wing of another. There is a well-supplied market at Kidderpur, less than a mile off. A handsome and well-stocked Zoological Garden has been opened in this suburb. There is a large Central and District jail at Alipur, mainly filled with long-term male convicts from various Districts of Bengal; the total number of prisoners on the 31st December 1881 was 2015; the daily average number of prisoners during that year was 1974. There is also a Central and District jail for females at Russa in the neighbourhood, which, at the end of 1881, contained 181 prisoners. On the Calcutta maid\u00e1n opposite Alipur Bridge, stood two trees under which duels were fought. It was here that the famous meeting, in 1780, between Hastings and Francis took place.\n\nAlipur.\u2014Civil station and head-quarters of the Baxa Sub-division of Jalpaiguri District, Bengal. It is situated on the road from Kuch Behar to Baxa, on the north bank of the Kalj\u00e1n\u00ed river, which separates Jalpaiguri District from Kuch Behar State; distance from Kuch Behar town, 10 miles, and from Baxa, 22 miles. The nearest railway station at the present time (1883) is Mughal-h\u00e1t, on a branch of the Northern Bengal State railway, 30 miles distant, but an extension is now in course of construction to Kuch Behar town, only 12 miles distant. There are also good roads to Kuch Behar and Jalpaiguri town. Alipur is also the head-quarters of the officer in charge of the Baxa forests, and contains a large and well-stocked timber depot.\n\nAlipur.\u2014The southernmost tahsil of Muzaffargarh District, Punjab.

The lands comprising this State were granted by Hindupat, R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Panna, to Achal Singh, and the grant was confirmed to his son, Part\u00e1b Singh, by Ali Bah\u00e1dur. On the British occupation, Part\u00e1b Singh obtained a sanad confirming him in his possession, and granting him the right of adoption; and his great-grandson, Hindupat, succeeded in 1840. On the death of Hindupat in 1871, he was succeeded by his son Chhartarpatti, on whom the title of R\u00e1i Bah\u00e1dur was conferred at the Delhi Darbar in 1877. The chief belongs to the Purihar caste of R\u00e1jputs; he maintains a force of 180 infantry with 2 guns.\n\n**Alipura.**\u2014Chief town of Alipura State, Bundelkhand, North-Western Provinces.

Area, 836 square miles; population (1881) 56,827, dwelling in 312 villages, and occupying 10,136 houses. Hindus numbered 35,834; Muhammadans, 1871; Jains, 167; aboriginal Bhils, 18,955. Males, 29,227; females, 27,600. The country is mountainous, and covered with jungle. The chief products are b\u00e1jra (Holcus spicatus) and makka or Indian corn. There is no record of the date when this State was established, or of its first rulers. It appears, however, owing to its wild and hilly position, to have been little disturbed during the turmoils caused by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 invasion of M\u00e1lwa. Immediately before the establishment of British supremacy in M\u00e1lwa, R\u00e1n\u00e1 Prat\u00e1b Singh was chief of Ali R\u00e1jpur. He had in his service a Mekr\u00e1ni adventurer, named Mus\u00e1f\u00edr, who put down pretenders to the succession and managed the State after the\nR\u00e1n\u00e1's death, in trust for his posthumous son Jaswant Singh, who died in 1862, leaving a will by which he divided the State between his two sons. The British Government, in consultation with the neighbouring chiefs, set this will aside, and allowed the elder son, Gangdeo, to succeed to the whole State; but during the later years of Gangdeo's life, his incapacity for rule, and the consequent anarchy, compelled the British authorities to take the territory temporarily under management. Gangdeo died in 1871, and was succeeded by his brother, R\u00e1n\u00e1 R\u00fap Deoj\u00ed, who died on the 29th October 1881. He was succeeded by a cousin named W\u00e1je Singh, who is now (1883) a minor. During his minority, the State is managed by a minister appointed by the British Government. The chief, who is a Rahtor R\u00e1jput, bears the title of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1n\u00e1, and is entitled to a salute of 9 guns. Revenue in 1881-82, \u00a39500. Ali R\u00e1jpur was formerly tributary to Dh\u00e1r, but the latter State ceded its rights to the English in 1821; and the Chief now pays a tribute of \u00a31100 direct to the English Government, of which \u00a31000 is paid to Dh\u00e1r, as former feudal lord, and the remainder received as a contribution to a police fund. The sum of \u00a3150 per annum is also contributed for the M\u00e1lwa Bh\u00edl Corps. There are 5 schools and 1 dispensary in the State. The military force of the Chief consists of 2 field guns, 9 horse, and 150 policemen.\n\nAli-R\u00e1jpur.\u2014Chief town of the Ali-R\u00e1jpur State, under the Bh\u00edl Agency of Central India. Lat. 22\u00b0 11' N., long. 74\u00b0 24' E. Contains about 1000 houses, and a population (1881) of 4100. The streets are broad, straight, and airy, and lined with shops. The old palace is a handsome building, and is used as a residence by the State officials, and contains the treasury; near it are the school, dispensary, and jail. Opening on to the b\u00e1z\u00e1r is the 'B\u00e1ra,' containing the Chief's residence. Two creeks and about a dozen wells\u20143 of them being good\u2014form the water supply. Post-office.\n\nAliw\u00e1l.\u2014Village in Ludhi\u00e1na District, Punjab. Situated on the left bank of the Sutlej (Satlaj), 9 miles west of Ludhi\u00e1na town, in lat. 30\u00b0 57' N., long. 75\u00b0 37' E. Famous as the scene of the great battle of the first Sikh war. At the end of June 1846 it was held by Ranj\u00far Singh, who had crossed the river in force and threatened Ludhi\u00e1na. On the 28th, Sir Harry Smith, with a view to clearing the left or British bank, attacked him, and after a desperate struggle thrice pierced the Sikh troops with his cavalry, and pushed them into the river, where large numbers perished, leaving 67 guns to the victors. The immediate consequence of the victory of Aliwal was the evacuation of the Sikh forts on the British side of the Sutlej, and the submission of the whole territory east of that river to the British Government.\n\nAliy\u00e1r.\u2014River in Coimbatore District, Madras Presidency.\n\nAllah\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Division, under a Commissioner, in the North-Western\nProvinces, lying between $24^\\circ 47'$ and $26^\\circ 57' 45''$ N. lat., and between $79^\\circ 19' 30''$ and $83^\\circ 7' 45''$ E. long., and including the six Districts of Cawnpur, Fatehpur, Banda, Allahabad, Hamirpur, and Jaunpur, all of which see separately. Area of Allahabad Division, 13,745 square miles; population (1881) 5,754,855, including 5,194,243 Hindus, 549,900 Muhammadans, 99 Sikhs, 778 Jains, 23 Jews, 30 Parsis, and 9782 Christians or 'others.' Number of towns and villages, 11,934; number of occupied houses, 1,032,732; average density of population, 418.6 per square mile; towns and villages per square mile, 0.86; inmates per occupied house, 6.5. The total adult male agricultural population of the Division is returned at 1,350,820, cultivating 5,004,928 acres, or an average of 3.71 acres each. The total population of the Division, however, including women and children, dependent on the soil, numbers 3,916,758, or 68.06 per cent. of the total population. Of the total area of 13,745 square miles, 13,430 are assessed for Government revenue, of which 7702 are returned as under cultivation, 3004 as cultivable, and the remainder as uncultivable. Total Government assessment of Allahabad Division, including cesses on the land, \u00a3821,958, or an average of 4s. 5d. per cultivated acre. Rental paid by cultivators, including cesses, \u00a31,592,836, or an average of 6s. 4\u00bdd. per cultivated acre.\n\nAllahabad.\u2014District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the North-Western Provinces, lying between $24^\\circ 47'$ and $25^\\circ 47' 15''$ N. lat., and between $81^\\circ 11' 30''$ and $82^\\circ 21'$. Area, 2833.1 square miles; population (1881) 1,474,106. Allahabad is a District in the Division of the same name, and is bounded on the north by Partabgarh District in Oudh; on the east by Jaunpur and Mirzapur; on the south by the Native State of Rewa; and on the south-west and west by Banda and Fatehpur. Greatest length of the District from east to west, 74 miles; maximum breadth from north to south, 64 miles. The administrative head-quarters are at Allahabad, the capital of the North-Western Provinces.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of Allahabad is situated at the confluence of the Jumna (Jamuna) and Ganges, and its limits embrace the territory lying between the two great streams, together with portions beyond their outer banks. These rivers apportion the District into three well-marked Sub-divisions:\u2014(1) The Doab, or triangular wedge of land enclosed by the converging channels of the Ganges and Jumna. The northern side of this alluvial region shares the general characteristics of the Gangetic Doab, of which it forms the easternmost extremity. It stretches along the south bank of the Ganges in a level and highly cultivated plain, the monotony of which is only broken by patches of usar, whitened with the saline efflorescence known as reh. But the southward slope, through which the surface drainage\nflows into the Jumna, is furrowed by ravines. The Sas\u00far Khaderi, Kinhai, and other small streams which take their rise in the watershed between the main rivers, and drain into the Jumna, have scooped out for themselves in the light and sandy soil a series of mimic gorges, closely simulating the beds of mountain torrents. (2) The trans-Ganges tract, stretching from the north of that river, to the borders of Oudh, Jaunpur, and Mirz\u00e1pur; and (3) the trans-Jumna tract, extending from the south bank of the Jumna down to the frontiers of B\u00e1n\u00e1, Rew\u00e1, and Mirz\u00e1pur. At the apex of the Do\u00e1b tract, close to the confluence of the two great rivers, is the city of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. The natural sub-divisions of this Do\u00e1b tract, with an area of 821 square miles, are\u2014(a) The level tract in the centre, consisting at the edges, of light, high-lying loam, sinking gradually westward, and stiffening into clay soil. In the higher lying lands, the crops are mainly jo\u00e1r, b\u00e1jra, cotton, gram, masur\u00ed, etc. Proceeding westward, jo\u00e1r and b\u00e1jra are replaced by rice; and gram, etc., by wheat, barley, and flax. It is only in the western portion of this centre tract that irrigation is practicable to any appreciable extent. (b) The ravine lands along the banks of the Ganges, Jumna, and Sas\u00far Khaderi, consisting of a very light sandy soil, with a substratum of kankar. The crops here consist mainly of the poorer staples, and irrigation is impracticable, owing to the prevalence of kankar, and the great depth before water is reached. (c) A magnificent strip of alluvial land (kachhar or char) under the banks of the Ganges, flooded in the rains, and subject to changes from fluvial action, but growing splendid spring crops without need of irrigation. (d) The Jumna tari, a fine moist soil, flooded in the rains, but growing good wheat and other spring crops without irrigation. It resembles the Ganges kachhar, but is below that tract in general fertility. The trans-Ganges, or north-eastern sub-division, has three descriptions of soil answering to those of the Do\u00e1b tract\u2014(a) the Ganges kachhar, (b) the raviny bank, (c) the level upland. But this part of the District has a much more extensive water-supply, and far surpasses the Do\u00e1b in general fertility. It contains a denser population, with a better class of tenantry. Thriving villages lie close together all over its surface, and scarcely any patches of waste land can be found. Facilities for irrigation abound, and the finer qualities of grain and pulses are very extensively cultivated, together with sugar, which forms one of the most valuable crops of the District. The trans-Jumna tract to the south-east is the largest of the three sub-divisions, and the most varied in physical features. The drainage is entirely into the Ganges and Jumna, the main feeder being the river Tons. Latitudinally, the tract is divided into two parts by a range of low stone hills, which enter the District about 4 miles south of the Ganges. North of these hills, in the Ganges valley there are the usual alluvial lands, though not so\nextensive as on the opposite bank of the river. Along the Jumna and Tons run strips of sloping tari. Above these, on all three rivers, occur raviny ridges; while farther inland are level tracts sinking gradually into a trough at the foot of the hilly country. South of the stone range, the aspect of the country changes entirely. The land rises by a series of sandstone terraces toward the Kaimur range (an outlier of the great Vindhyan plateau), whose summits slope up beyond the British frontier, in the neighbouring State of Rewa. Each long roll of the terrace declivity is topped by a cultivated table-land; but the intermediate ridges are stony and untilled, covered with scrubby jungle\u2014the haunt of leopards, wolves, antelopes, and wild boars. These barren spurs have a sparse and scattered population, whose villages often lie at great distances from one another.\n\nThe main rivers of the District are the Ganges, Jumna, Tons, and Belan. The Ganges, after entering Allahabad at its north-western corner, flows a south-easterly course for 78 miles. The breadth between the high banks of the river, corresponding with the breadth of the stream at high flood, varies from one to six miles, and averages about two and a half or three miles. The average breadth of the stream when at its lowest in May and June is about three-quarters of a mile. During the rainy season, the river is navigable for any kind of craft, the average depth being 60 or 70 feet. In the dry season the depth goes down to 15 or 20 feet, but navigation is difficult for large boats at this time, on account of the number of shifting sand-banks. The river has no permanent bridges, but bridges of boats are maintained from October to June at Rajghat, where the Grand Trunk Road crosses the river towards Delhi; and also at Phaphamau, the starting-place of the main road to south-eastern Oudh. In the rains, these bridges are replaced by ferries. Boat ferries also ply between the principal villages. Frequent changes take place in the course of the stream, and alluvion and diluvion take place yearly on a large scale, and become a fruitful source of affrays and litigation in the land courts. The Jumna enters the District at its south-west corner, holding a course of 63 miles east by north-east, till it effects a junction with the Ganges opposite Allahabad city. The Jumna differs from the Ganges in its narrower valley, its more constant bed, the greater clearness of its waters, and the greater number and depth of the ravines on its banks. The breadth of the stream in time of flood averages a mile and a half, and in the dry season half a mile. It is navigable at all seasons of the year, but in the hot months navigation by large cargo boats is impeded by numerous shallows. Average depth in the rains, 80 feet; and in the hot season, 16 feet. A permanent railway bridge spans the river about a mile above its junction with the Ganges, and ferries are maintained at the more important crossings. The Tons river rises in the Kaimur Hills.\nsouth of the District, and flows a north-easterly course till it falls into the Ganges some 19 miles below the confluence of that stream with the Jumna. The river has a rocky bed, and stony rapids are met with every few miles up to within a short distance of the Ganges. Navigable by small boats, but at certain places only. Crossed by the East Indian Railway bridge two or three miles above its mouth, and by several boat ferries. The Belan, also rising in the Kaim\u00far Hills, enters the District from the south-east, and flowing a westerly course, falls into the Tons on the Rew\u00e1 border. The bed of the river is stony, and numerous rapids render navigation impossible. Ferries are maintained at road crossings during the rains; at other seasons the river is almost everywhere fordable. The other streams and watercourses of the District are quite unimportant, and only contain water in the rainy season. The only lake of any importance is the Alw\u00e1ra jh\u00edl, in the extreme west of the District, a shallow but permanent sheet of water, $2\\frac{1}{2}$ miles long by 2 miles broad, whose marshy flats are covered with wild-duck, teal, coot, and other waterfowl. Excellent sport may also be obtained among the hills of the trans-Jumna region. Minerals are few, but good building stone is found at Part\u00e1bpur, Deoria, and R\u00e1japur. The stone used for building Akbar's fort came from the Deoria and Part\u00e1bpur quarries, which are conveniently situated for water carriage on the south bank of the Jumna.\n\n**History.**\u2014In the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata, the country round Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d bears the name of V\u00e1ran\u00e1vata, and was the scene of the exile undergone by the famous P\u00e1ndava brethren. At the period of the Ram\u00e1yana, the trans-Ganges region was ruled by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kosala; and we learn that R\u00e1ma was welcomed, on his banishment, at Singror in this District, by Guha, King of the Bhils. The mythical hero of the Solar race crossed the Ganges in a boat, entered Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, and proceeded over the Jumna into Bundelkhand. But the earliest authentic information which we possess with reference to the District is obtained from a sculptured monument in the fort at Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, erected by the Buddhist King Asoka about the year B.C. 240. This pillar, a tall and slender monolith with a tapering shaft, bears in addition to the edict of its original founder, Asoka, a later inscription detailing the conquests of Samudra Gupta, about the second century after Christ; and it was re-erected in 1605 by the Mughal Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, who has commemorated thereon his accession in a Persian legend. Fa Hian, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim, found the District still a part of the Kosala kingdom about A.D. 414; and two centuries later, his countryman, Hwen Thsang, visited Pray\u00e1g (the Hindu name of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d), where he records the existence of two Buddhist monasteries and many Hindu temples. From this time, we know nothing of the history of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d until the invasion of Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn Ghori in 1194. The District was\nthen conquered by the Musalm\u00e1ns, in whose hands it remained until the introduction of British rule. During the 13th and 14th centuries the country round Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d was included in the fief of Karra, at which town the Governor had his head-quarters. Karra was the scene of the famous meeting between Muiz-ud-d\u00edn and his father in 1286. The son had just succeeded Balban on the throne of Delhi, and the father was making his way up from Bengal to oppose him. They met at Karra, and, inspired with an aversion to bloodshed, conferred with each other from boats in the middle of the Ganges, and resolved to march together to the capital. Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d was in the possession of Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn at the end of the 13th century, and it was in the town of Karra that he basely murdered his uncle, the aged Sult\u00e1n Firoz Sh\u00e1h. Under succeeding princes, the history of the District is a tedious narrative of ambitious revolts and their barbarous suppression. About 1529, Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d was wrested from the Path\u00e1ns by B\u00e1bar, and its modern name was bestowed upon it by the Emperor Akbar. Prince Sal\u00edm had his residence here as Governor during the lifetime of his father; and the mausoleum in the Khushru-b\u00e1gh commemorates Sal\u00edm\u2019s rebellious son. Early in the 18th century, when the Bundelas under Chhatar S\u00e1l (see BANDA) were beginning their successful national movement against the Mughal power, Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d was overrun by the Bundela and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 chieftains. During the subsequent anarchy, the Oudh Government at one time held the supremacy; at another, the ubiquitous Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s were in possession; and still later, in 1765, the English restored the town to Sh\u00e1h Alam, the phantom Emperor of Delhi. For some years, Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d was the seat of the imperial court; but in 1771 Sh\u00e1h Alam removed to Delhi, and threw himself into the arms of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. The British held that his eastern dominions were vacated, and sold the abandoned Provinces to the Naw\u00e1b of Oudh for 50 l\u00e1khs of rupees. Sh\u00e1h Alam remained a State prisoner in the hands of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s until 1803, when the victories of Lord Lake set him free. Meanwhile difficulties arose from time to time with regard to the payment of the Oudh tribute, which was permanently in arrears; and in 1801 the Naw\u00e1b agreed to a compromise, by which he made over his territory between the Ganges and the Jumna to the British Government in lieu of tribute. The District of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d formed part of the tract thus ceded. During the Mutiny of 1857, the Sepoys at Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d revolted (June 6th), and massacred most of their officers. At the same time the populace rose throughout the city, set free the prisoners in jail, and murdered every European and Eurasian upon whom they could lay hands. Happily, however, the British forces held the fort with the aid of a Sikh detachment; and on the 11th of June, Colonel Neill arrived to take the command. The insurgents were promptly attacked and repulsed; and only a fortnight after the outbreak, the city and station\nwere once more in the hands of the authorities. Soon afterwards, Havelock arrived at Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d; and, the position having been secured, the main army passed on for Cawnpur. No further disturbance arose, and the peaceful course of administration in the District has never since been interrupted.\n\n**Population.**\u2014An enumeration in 1853 returned the total number of inhabitants at 1,379,788. The population in 1872, according to the Census of that year, but allowing for subsequent changes of area, amounted to 1,396,241. The latest Census, in 1881, returned a total population of 1,474,106, showing an increase of 77,865, or 5\u00b77 per cent. in the nine years. The male population in 1881 numbered 741,730, and the female 732,376; proportion of males in total population, 50\u00b73 per cent. Average density of population, 520\u00b73 per square mile; number of towns and villages, 3509; number of occupied houses, 288,647; number of villages per square mile, 1\u00b723; houses per square mile, 101\u00b78; inmates per house, 5\u00b71. As regards the religious distinctions of the people, 1,272,408, or 86\u00b73 per cent., were returned as Hindus, and 195,201, or 13\u00b72 per cent., as Muhammadans. There were also 6079 Christians, 337 Jains, 68 Sikhs, and 13 P\u00e1rs\u00eds. Amongst the Hindus, the Br\u00e1hmans formed the largest body, amounting in all to 182,294 persons. The other chief tribes were the R\u00e1jputs (50,703), Baniy\u00e1s (41,300), Ah\u00edrs (144,619), Cham\u00e1rs (149,449), Gadar\u00edas (40,819), K\u00e1chhis (59,723), K\u00e1yasths (19,336), K\u00farm\u00eds (134,550), Mallahs (38,492), P\u00e1s\u00eds (98,119), and Telis (26,641). The Musalm\u00e1ns are divided by religion into 185,402 Sunnis and 9799 Shi\u00e1s. The District contains only one town with a population exceeding 5000\u2014namely, Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, including the civil station and cantonments, and the suburbs of Katra and D\u00e1r\u00e1ganj, with a total population of 148,547. See Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d City. Of the total of 3509 towns and villages, 1427 contained less than two hundred inhabitants in 1881; 1282 from two to five hundred; 580 from five hundred to a thousand; 177 from one to two thousand; 28 from two to three thousand; 10 from three to five thousand; and 1, Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d city and suburbs, with upwards of a hundred thousand inhabitants. The District contains no walled or fortified places; but the fort of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, commanding the junction of the Ganges and the Jumna, is strongly guarded, and garrisoned by a European force. The ruins of a few small fortresses also line the bank of the Jumna. Most of the houses are mud-roofed, but the better sort are tiled. In the towns there are two-storied buildings, and in Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d itself the wealthy bankers have erected several showy mansions at Kydganj. The various trades possess their panch\u00e1yats, or caste guilds, which practically operate like European trades-unions. Under their influence a Baniy\u00e1 would not be allowed to undersell his fellow-tradesmen, nor a labourer to work for less than the\ncurrent rate of wages. But the *panch\u00e1yats* also take note of religious questions, and punish social or moral delinquencies by expulsion from caste. The village community generally embraces a governing body of Th\u00e1kurs, Ah\u00edrs, or Br\u00e1hmans, who own the land, and let out the greater portion to inferior cultivators; a well-to-do peasantry of K\u00e1chhis, K\u00farm\u00eds, and Lodhis (some of them also landholders), tilling the soil under the Th\u00e1kur landlords, whom they regard as a superior race; a small number of Baniy\u00e1s, who act as bankers or shopkeepers; and finally, a labouring class, consisting of Cham\u00e1rs, P\u00e1sis, and other dark-skinned races, of slighter build and inferior physique to the higher castes. Each community also includes the usual village officers\u2014the headman, the *patw\u00e1ri* or accountant, the family priest, the barber, and all the minor functionaries of the native system. As regards occupation, the Census Report of 1881 returned the male population under the following six classes:\u2014(1) Professional, including civil and military, and the learned professions, 17,405; (2) domestic servants, inn and lodging-house keepers, 6920; (3) commercial, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 13,868; (4) agricultural, including cultivators, gardeners, tenders of animals, etc., 337,267; (5) industrial, including manufacturers, artisans, etc., 81,900; (6) indefinite and non-productive (being 24,690 general labourers, and 259,680 male children or persons of unspecified occupation), 284,370.\n\n**Agriculture.**\u2014Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d is one of the Districts where cultivation has nearly reached its utmost limit, very little waste land fit for tillage being now left uncultivated. The *khar\u00edf*, or autumn crops, are sown in June, on the first appearance of the rains, and reaped in October and November. Food-stuffs are the staples of this harvest, the principal crops being rice, pulses, *jo\u00e1r* and *b\u00e1jra* (millets). Cotton is sown at the same time, the coarser varieties being picked in November or December, and the finer in April or May. The *rab\u00ed*, or spring crops, are sown in October and reaped in March or April. They consist of wheat, barley, and other grains. Manure is used for both harvests, wherever it can be obtained. The acreage under the different crops was ascertained at the time of the last land settlement (1876\u201377) to be as follows:\u2014*Khar\u00edf* crops\u2014*jo\u00e1r*, 49,546; *b\u00e1jra*, 75,982; cotton, 41,153; indigo, 8942; pulses, 110,399; Indian corn, 89; millets, 25,164; rice, 155,003; hemp, 960; oil-seeds, 1895: total *khar\u00edf*, 469,133 acres. *Rab\u00ed* crops\u2014wheat, 79,921 acres; barley, 182,536; *birra*, 94,001; gram, 109,703; peas, 40,001; *mas\u00fari*, 9118; oil-seeds, 18,626: total *rab\u00ed*, 533,906. Miscellaneous crops\u2014sugar-cane, 18,853; poppy, 3573; tobacco, 1229; gourds, 2073; garden crops, 2787; *p\u00e1n*, 106; grass for grazing, 1691: total miscellaneous crops, 30,312 acres. Grand total of area under cultivation, 1,033,351 acres. As a rule, the same land is not allowed to bear two crops a year, but sometimes advantage is taken of a simple\nsystem of rotation to secure a second harvest after rice has been grown for the kharif. The area of land growing two crops at the time of the settlement was returned at 58,720 acres. Irrigation is carried on by means of wells, tanks, and jhils, there being no canals in the District. The area under irrigation at the time of the settlement was 376,330 acres, or 36\u00b74 per cent. of the total cultivation, of which 207,416 acres were in the rich trans-Ganges tract, or 66\u00b72 per cent. of the cultivated area. In the sterile southern or trans-Jumna tract, irrigation was only carried out in 63,564 acres, or 16\u00b71 per cent of the cultivated area. The area under trees according to the settlement measurements is 72,304 acres, the trans-Ganges pargan\u00e1s in the north-west being the best wooded, and the trans-Jumna in the south-east, the worst. Near Allah\u00e1bad city, groves of guavas, oranges, custard apples, pomegranates, lemons, plantains, karonda, j\u00e1mun, etc., cover a considerable area, and yield large profits. In the villages, the mango predominates; and mahu\u00e1, tamarind, and aonla trees are grown to some extent. The indigenous or jungle trees are the pip\u00e1l, nim, g\u00falar, shisham, bab\u00fal, ber, dh\u00e1k, etc. Where there are many small proprietors, the owner often cultivates the whole of his little estate in person. More frequently, however, the greater part of an estate is leased to cultivating tenants, and only about 15 per cent. of the area is held by the proprietor as s\u012br, or homestead. The total adult male agricultural population of the District was returned in 1881 at 332,116, cultivating 1,080,448 acres, or an average of 3\u00b725 acres each. The total agricultural population, however, including women and children, numbered 986,947, or 66\u00b795 per cent. of the District population. Of the total area of 2833 square miles, 2783 are assessed for Government revenue, and of these 1662 are returned as cultivated, 451 as cultivable, and the remainder as uncultivable. Total Government assessment, including local rates and cesses on land, \u00a3278,211, or an average of 5s. 2\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Total rental paid by cultivators, \u00a3397,438, or an average of 7s. 4\u00bcd. per cultivated acre. The tenures of land belong to the three standard classes of the North-Western Provinces\u2014zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri, where the land is owned in common and the profits divided by the shareholders, none of whom possesses a separate plot; pattid\u00e1ri, where each shareholder owns a plot on his own account, while the whole estate remains answerable to Government for the revenue in common; and bh\u00e1y\u00e1ch\u00e1ra, where the rights and interests of each shareholder are regulated, not by ancestral custom, but by actual possession. Wages ruled as follows in 1877:\u2014Coolies and unskilled hands, 2\u00bdd. to 3\u00bed. per diem; agricultural labourers, 2\u00bcd. to 3d. per diem; bricklayers and carpenters, 6d. to 2s. per diem. Women get about one-fifth less than men, while children under 12 are paid at from one-half to one-third. Prices of food grains have risen greatly of late years. Dividing the years of the present\ncentury into three periods, viz. (1) from the earliest period of British rule up to first settlement in 1833, (2) from 1833 to the Mutiny, and (3) from the Mutiny down to 1876, the average prices of the staple food grains were as follow:\u2014Wheat, 1st period, $26\\frac{1}{4}$ sers per rupee, or 4s. 3d. a cwt.; 2nd period, $20\\frac{3}{4}$ sers per rupee, or 5s. 10d. a cwt.; 3rd period, $18$ sers per rupee, or 6s. 3d. a cwt. Barley, 1st period, $35\\frac{3}{4}$ sers per rupee, or 3s. 1d. a cwt.; 2nd period, $32\\frac{1}{2}$ sers per rupee, or 3s. 5\u00bdd. a cwt.; 3rd period, $24$ sers per rupee, or 4s. 8d. a cwt. Gram, 1st period, $32\\frac{3}{4}$ sers per rupee, or 3s. 5\u00bdd. a cwt.; 2nd period, $38$ sers per rupee, or 3s. a cwt.; 3rd period, $22$ sers per rupee, or 5s. 1d. per cwt. Rice, 1st period, $21\\frac{3}{4}$ sers per rupee, or 5s. 2d. a cwt.; 2nd period, $16\\frac{1}{3}$ sers per rupee, or 6s. 10\u00bdd. a cwt.; 3rd period, $15$ sers per rupee, or 7s. 6d. a cwt. Jo\u00e1r, 1st period, $41\\frac{1}{2}$ sers per rupee, or 2s. 8\u00bdd. a cwt.; 2nd period, $33\\frac{3}{4}$ sers per rupee, or 3s. 4\u00bdd. a cwt.; 3rd period, $24$ sers per rupee, or 4s. 8d. a cwt. B\u00e1jra, 1st period, $39$ sers per rupee, or 2s. 11\u00bdd. a cwt.; 2nd period, $33$ sers per rupee, or 3s. 5d. a cwt.; 3rd period, $23\\frac{1}{2}$ sers per rupee, or 4s. 9\u00bdd. a cwt. Prices in Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d District were returned for 1882 as follow:\u2014Wheat, $18\\frac{1}{4}$ sers, or 37 lbs. per rupee; barley, $28$ sers, or 56 lbs. per rupee; gram (pease), $26\\frac{1}{4}$ sers, or 53 lbs. per rupee; rice, $20$ sers, or 40 lbs. per rupee; jo\u00e1r (great millet), $33$ sers, or 66 lbs. per rupee; b\u00e1jra (common millet), $30$ sers, or 60 lbs. per rupee.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Famines from drought occurred in Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d in 1770, 1783, 1803, 1819, and 1837, and severe scarcities in 1813, 1860\u201361, 1868\u201369, and in 1873\u201374. In the two famines antecedent to British rule, beyond a little gratuitous relief at the capital, no measures appear to have been taken for the relief of the starving multitudes. In 1803, considerable remissions of revenue were made, and large advances for the purchase of seed and plough cattle were granted, but there was no regular famine organization. The exportation of grain was prohibited in 1813. Public relief works in times of famine were first started in 1837, and besides remissions and advances by Government, a great deal was done by private subscriptions. The distress in Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d in this year was very great, though not quite so disastrous as in the country to the west of Cawnpur. The scheme of relief then sketched out was fully developed in subsequent scarcities, and improvements in the means of communication have also done much to diminish the intensity of such calamities. But for these, there is no doubt these later scarcities would have been as disastrous as their predecessors. In 1873\u201374, severe scarcity existed in the wild and barren hill-country and the trans-Jumna pargan\u00e1s. Extra poor-houses were temporarily established, and, by the prompt and vigorous action of Government, the people were enabled to tide over the season. The rains of 1874 put an end to the danger, and no further assistance was needed.\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The bankers and large traders of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d are chiefly Kshattriyas and Baniy\u00e1s, though a few Br\u00e1hmans and Bengalis conduct large businesses. The leading houses have agencies at Calcutta, Benares, Mirz\u00e1pur, Cawnpur, Agra, and H\u00e1thras. Large quantities of cotton, grain, and miscellaneous agricultural produce used to be sent down the two great rivers in native sailing craft; but the main channel of transport is now the East Indian Railway. Besides the principal towns, there are nineteen considerable markets which carry on an outside as well as a local trade, to an estimated value of about \u00a350,000 annually. The principal local b\u00e1z\u00e1rs or petty markets are returned as numbering 45. No minerals are found in the District, except nodular limestone or kankar and the saline earth of the \u00fasar plains, which is utilized for the manufacture of salt and saltpetre. The principal fair is that known as the M\u00e1gh Mel\u00e1, held on the plain near the fort of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d in December and January. It lasts for a whole month, and is attended by as many as 250,000 persons in ordinary years, either for religious or commercial purposes. Every twelfth year is a special occasion, and the last kumbh mel\u00e1 in 1882 is estimated to have been attended by at least a million of devotees at one time. The great bathing-day is at the time of the new moon. The means of communication are excellent and varied. The East Indian Railway main line runs through the whole length of the District from south-east to north-west. It enters from the side of Mirz\u00e1pur, and runs for 36 miles south of the Ganges; at N\u00e1in\u00ed it crosses the Jumna by a magnificent iron girder bridge (1110 yards long and 106 feet above the river), and passes close to the city of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d; thence it runs north-westerly through the Do\u00e1b pargan\u00e1s, and emerges from the District 43 miles from Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. The stations on this line within the District boundaries are Nahw\u00e1i, S\u00edrsa road, Karchh\u00e1na, N\u00e1in\u00ed, Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, M\u00e1na\u00fari, Bh\u00e1rw\u00e1ri, and Sir\u00e1thu. The Jabalpur (Jubbulpore) branch of the East Indian Railway, the through route to Bombay in connection with the Great Indian Peninsula line, runs through the trans-Jumna pargan\u00e1s, with stations at Jasra and Siur\u00e1jpur. It diverges from the main line at N\u00e1in\u00ed Junction, and passes into Rew\u00e1 23 miles south-west of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. Passenger steamers formerly plied between Calcutta and Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d until superseded by the railway. The Grand Trunk Road, running nearly parallel with the East Indian Railway, passes through the District for 76 miles and conveys the main local traffic. Other good roads connect Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d with all the surrounding centres of population. Total length of communications\u2014railways, 102 miles; metalled roads, 207 miles; unmetalled roads, 626 miles; navigable rivers, 141 miles. There is a free public library, which contained about 8700 volumes in 1877; besides an Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d Institute, for the social, moral, and intellectual improvement of the people. The District possesses\nfive English newspapers\u2014the *Pioneer*, a daily paper, with its weekly issue the *Pioneer Mail*, the *Commercial Gazette*, *Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d Advertiser*, *Railway Service Gazette*, and *Exchange Gazette*, besides a weekly vernacular newspaper, the *Dabir-i-Hind*, and the Presbyterian Mission press. There are also several private printing presses, both English and vernacular.\n\n**Administration.**\u2014The District staff generally consists of a Collector-Magistrate, two joint-Magistrates, and one assistant-Magistrate, and two deputies, besides the usual civil, fiscal, and constabulary officers. The total revenue of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d District in 1880\u201381 was \u00a3289,839, of which \u00a3237,224, or 81\u00b784 per cent., was derived from the land tax. The total cost of officials and police of all kinds in the same year, was \u00a342,858. Twenty-one civil and revenue, and the same number of magisterial courts were open. The regular District police force numbered 884 officers and men, besides 386 employed in towns. Total, 1270 officers and men, maintained at a cost of \u00a314,852, of which \u00a312,003 was contributed from provincial, and \u00a32848 from local sources. In addition, there is also a rural police or village watch numbering in 1880\u201381, 3425. The total machinery for the protection of person and property, consisted, therefore, of 4695 men of all ranks, giving an average of one man to every 0\u00b751 square mile, or one to every 314 inhabitants. The total number of Government inspected schools in 1880 was 170, attended by 5593 pupils. This is exclusive of uninspected and unaided schools, which are numerous, but regarding which returns are not obtainable. The Census Report of 1881 returned 12,747 boys and 851 girls as under instruction; besides 40,013 males and 1908 females as able to read and write, but not under instruction. The principal educational institution is the Muir College at Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, with Principal and Professors. In 1880 it contained 79 students, not including the Law Class. The College, which is affiliated to the Calcutta University, has a special Law Class attached to it, attended in 1880 by 21 students. There are three places of confinement for prisoners in Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. The Central Jail, at N\u00e1ini, contains all the prisoners from the whole Division who are sentenced for a term of years. It had a daily average number of 2119 in 1880, of whom 126 were females. The District Jail, in the Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d Station, takes the short-term prisoners only; daily average in 1880, 720\u00b794, including 50 females. In the Magistrate\u2019s lock-up, prisoners under trial are confined during inquiry; daily average in 1880, 41\u00b775, of whom 2\u00b725 were females. The worst criminals are sent to the Andamans. The Postmaster-General for the North-Western Provinces has his office in Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, and there are 11 post-offices in the District. The telegraph runs side by side with the railway, and has offices at all the railway stations. The Government has a head telegraph office at the Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d station,\nwith branches at Katra, and in Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d city. The District is subdivided into 9 tahsils and 14 parganas, as follows:\u2014(1) Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d tahsil, comprising the pargan\u00e1 of Chail; (2) Sir\u00e1thu, comprising the pargan\u00e1 of Karra; (3) Manjh\u00e1npur, comprising the pargan\u00e1s of Kar\u00e1ri and Atharban; (4) Sor\u00e1on, comprising the pargan\u00e1s of Sor\u00e1on, Naw\u00e1b-ganj, and Mirz\u00e1pur; (5) Ph\u00falpur, including the pargan\u00e1s of Sikandra and Jh\u00fase; (6) Handia, including the pargan\u00e1s of Mah and Kiw\u00e1i; (7) Karchh\u00e1na, comprising the pargan\u00e1 of Arail; (8) B\u00e1ra, corresponding to the pargan\u00e1 of B\u00e1ra; and (9) Meja, comprising the pargan\u00e1 of Khair\u00e1g\u00e1rh. Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d is the only municipality in the District. In 1880\u201381 its total receipts were returned at \u00a322,248, of which \u00a315,104 was derived from octroi; expenditure, \u00a321,330.\n\nSanitary Aspects.\u2014Amongst the bare sandstone hills of the trans-Jumna pargan\u00e1s, the seasons are marked by the excessive heat and dryness which characterise the adjoining principality of Rew\u00e1. Elsewhere, however, the District has the same climate as the remainder of the Gangetic Do\u00e1b. Though the hot weather lasts from April to November, yet the dry west winds are not so trying here as in the upper country; and during the rains a cool breeze generally blows from the Ganges or the Jumna. The average rainfall of the ten years from 1872 to 1881 was 31.18 inches; the greatest fall was 42.4 inches in 1872, and the least was 17 inches in 1880. The general health of the District is good. Number of deaths registered in 1881, 41,917, or 28.43 per 1000 of the population. There are nine charitable dispensaries and one hospital in the District, at which 62,892 patients received medical relief in 1881. Besides these Government institutions, Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d contains a large hospital under private management, and an Eye hospital, neither of which receives any Government grant. The number of hakims, b\u00e1ids, and English educated Bengali medical practitioners is remarkably large, owing to the large number of sick who flock to the city. There is also a municipal hospital for contagious diseases. [For further details, see the Settlement Report of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d District, by F. W. Porter, Esq., C.S. (1878); the Provincial Administration Reports for 1880\u201381\u201382; and Census Report of 1881; more general information will be found in Kaye\u2019s History of the Sepoy War, Elphinstone\u2019s History of India, and Sir Henry Elliot\u2019s Persian Historians, especially the index in the eighth volume.]\n\nAllah\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Head-quarters tahsil or sub-division of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces, forming the extreme end of the wedge enclosed between the Ganges and the Jumna. Area, 312 square miles, of which 203.7 are cultivated. Population (1881) 318,059. Land revenue (excluding cesses), \u00a331,795; total revenue, \u00a336,728. In 1883, the tahsil contained 5 civil and 14 criminal courts, with 9 th\u00e1ns or police circles; strength of regular police, 146, and of rural police (chaukid\u00e1rs), 495.\nAllah\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014City in the Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d District, and the seat of Government for the North-Western Provinces. Lat. 25\u00b0 26' N., long. 81\u00b0 55' 15\" E. Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d is the third city of the North-Western Provinces (excluding Oudh) in size, and the first in administrative importance. It lies on the left bank of the Jumna, on the wedge of land formed by its confluence with the Ganges, and is distant 564 miles from Calcutta by road, and 89 from Benares. The population in 1872, including cantonments and suburbs, amounted to 143,693. In 1881, the total population (inclusive of cantonments) was returned at 148,547, made up as follows: Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d City, with Kydganj, 87,644; Katra-Colonelganj, 12,254; Civil Station, 25,710; Cantonments, 9780; and D\u00e1r\u00e1ganj, 13,159. The total population was divided into 99,518 Hindus, 43,558 Muhammadans, 140 Jains, 5257 Christians, and 74 'others.' The military force stationed at Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d on the 1st January 1882, consisted of two batteries of artillery, one regiment of European and one of Native Infantry, and a regiment of Native Cavalry. The cantonment population in 1881 numbered 9780. Total area of town and cantonments, 22,202 acres. On the angle formed by the junction of the Ganges and the Jumna stands the fort, its walls and glacis towering above the river banks. The civil station, cantonments, and city occupy the plain between the rivers; stretching back for a distance of over 6 miles from their point of junction. The town somewhat recedes from the Ganges, but reaches down to the Jumna bank, from which a few ravines run upwards into the level expanse. A large tract of low-lying land stretches along the Ganges bank, with the thriving suburb of D\u00e1r\u00e1ganj inland on the higher ground towards the fort. The English quarter is handsomely laid out with broad, well-watered roads, planted on both sides with trees. Many of the European residences stand in large compounds, or parks, and the Station is adorned with public buildings and gardens. The native town consists of a network of narrow streets, intersected by a few main roads. The houses are of every description, from the mud hovel of the suburbs to the garden palace of the Alop\u00ed B\u00e1gh, and the modern mansions of the wealthy native merchants in D\u00e1r\u00e1ganj and Kydganj. The East Indian Railway enters the city from the east by a magnificent bridge across the Jumna. Two bridges of boats lead over the Ganges; while the great rivers afford a water-way to all the principal cities of Bengal and the North-West. The Grand Trunk Road also passes through Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\nThe fort and city as they now stand were founded by Akbar in 1575; but a stronghold has existed at the junction of the two rivers since the earliest times (ante, p. 186). It was from this post, probably, that the Aryan Kshattriyas secured their conquests on the upper valleys of the Ganges and the Jumna, or overawed the yet unsubdued aborigines of Lower Bengal. The town was visited by Megasthenes, the ambassador\nof Seleukos, in the 3rd century B.C. The Chinese Buddhist pilgrim, Hwen Thsang, in the 7th century A.D., gives a circumstantial account of the city, under the name of Pray\u00e1g, which it still bears amongst the Hindu population. He describes it as \u2018situated at the confluence of the two rivers, to the west of a large sandy plain. In the midst of the city stood a Br\u00e1hmanical temple, to which the presentation of a single piece of money procured as much merit as that of one thousand pieces elsewhere. Before the principal room of the temple there was a large tree with wide-spreading branches, which was said to be the abode of a man-eating demon. The tree was surrounded with human bones, the remains of pilgrims who had sacrificed their lives before the temple, a practice which had been observed from time immemorial.\u2019 General Cunningham, from whom this passage is extracted, adds (1871):\u2014\u2018I think there can be little doubt that the famous tree here described by the pilgrim is the well-known \u201cundecaying Banian tree,\u201d which is still an object of worship at Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. This tree is now situated underground, at one side of a pillared court, which would appear to have been open formerly, and which is, I believe, the remains of the temple described by Hwen Thsang.\u2019 The sacred Banian is next mentioned in the pages of Rash\u00edd-ud-d\u00edn, who states that \u2018the tree of Pr\u00e1g\u2019 is situated at the confluence of the Jumna and Ganges; and this notice may be referred to the date of Mahm\u00fad of Ghazni. The sacred relic still exists, and represents to the devout mind a large trunk with spreading branches. So far as one can be certain without digging it up, it seems to be merely a forked post or log, stuck into the ground with its bark on, and renewed secretly by the attendant priests when it threatens to decay.\n\nDuring the early middle ages, Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d was probably in the hands of the Bh\u00edls. The Musalm\u00e1ns first conquered it in 1194, under the guidance of Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn Ghori; and for two centuries the surrounding country formed part of the Karra Province, until that Division was merged in the eastern principality of Jaunpur. B\u00e1bar wrested the District from the Path\u00e1ns in 1529, and in 1575 Akbar re-named the city as Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d and erected the fort. Towards the end of Akbar\u2019s reign, Prince Sal\u00edm, afterwards the Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, held the governorship of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, and lived in the fort. On Sal\u00edm\u2019s accession, his son Khusru rebelled against him, but was defeated and made over to the custody of his brother Khurram, the future Emperor Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n. Khusru died in 1615, and the mausoleum in the Khusru B\u00e1gh at Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d was erected in his honour. Throughout the 18th century, Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d experienced the usual reverses of Upper India during the disastrous period of Mughal decline. In 1736 it fell into the hands of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, who held it till 1750, when the city was sacked by the Path\u00e1ns of Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d. In 1753, Safdar Jang, the Naw\u00e1b of Oudh, seized upon the city, and retained possession till 1765. The English,\nafter their victory at Buxar (October 1764), restored it to the Emperor Sh\u00e1h Alam (1765). But in 1771, when he threw himself into the hands of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, they held that it had escheated, and sold it to the Naw\u00e1b of Oudh for 50 l\u00e1khs of rupees. As the Naw\u00e1b\u2019s tribute was in a state of perpetual and progressive arrears, an arrangement was effected in November 1801, by which the city and District, together with the Do\u00e1b generally, were ceded to the British. Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d was the seat of the Provincial Government from 1833, when the North-Western Provinces were constituted a separate administration, till 1835, when the capital was removed to Agra. Agra remained the seat of the Government of the North-Western Provinces until 1858. After the suppression of the Mutiny in that year, Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d again became the provincial capital, and has continued to be so up to the present date.\n\nDuring the Mutiny of 1857, Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d became the scene of one of the most serious outbreaks and massacres which occurred in the North-Western Provinces. The news of the outbreak at Meerut reached Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d on the 12th May. The native troops in the cantonment consisted of the 6th Bengal Native Infantry, a wing of a Sikh regiment, and two troops of Oudh Irregular Horse. A small body of European artillerymen were brought in from Chan\u00e1r fort as news of the spread of the rebellion arrived. Disquieting rumours soon prevailed in Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, but precautionary measures were taken in the fort and approaches to the city, and affairs remained quiet for some time. The Sepoys of the 6th volunteered to march against the rebels at Delhi, and at the sunset parade on the 6th June the thanks of the Governor-General were read to the regiment for their devoted loyalty. At nine o\u2019clock that very evening the Sepoys rose in open rebellion, fired upon and murdered most of their officers, and plundered the treasury. Many military and civil officers were in the fort at the time of the rising. The city rabble joined in the plunder and bloodshed; the jail was broken open, the dwellings of the Christian residents sacked and burnt, and every European or Eurasian captured, was murdered in cold blood. The work of destruction only ceased from want of anything further to destroy, and a sort of provisional insurgent government was established in the city, under a man called \u2018The Maulvi,\u2019 who proclaimed the restored rule of the Delhi Emperor. The little garrison of Europeans and loyal Sikhs held together in the fort until the arrival of General Neill with a party of the Madras Fusiliers on the 11th June. On the morning after his arrival, General Neill assumed the offensive against an insurgent rabble in the suburb of D\u00e1r\u00e1ganj, which was carried and destroyed. On the 15th June, after having despatched the women and children to Calcutta by steamer, Neill opened the guns of the fort upon the suburbs of Kydganj and M\u00falganj, which were occupied after some\nopposition. On the 17th June the Magistrate proceeded to the city Kotwali and re-established his authority, without opposition. The rebel leader 'the Maulvi' escaped; and on the morning of the 18th, Neill with his whole force marched into the city, which he found deserted.\n\nHavelock arrived at Allahabad shortly after, and the united force moved on to Cawnpur. Although the surrounding country remained for a time in rebellion, there was no further disturbance in Allahabad itself. In 1858, after the suppression of the Mutiny, Allahabad was definitively selected as the seat of Government for the North-Western Provinces.\n\nThe fort still forms a striking object from the river. It crowns the point where the Ganges and the Jumna unite. But the ancient castle of the Musalm\u00e1n governors no longer remains; the high towers having been cut down, and the stone ramparts topped with turfed parapets and fronted with a sloping glacis. The changes, rendered necessary by modern military exigencies, have greatly detracted from the picturesque-ness of the fort as a relic of antiquity. Within the enclosure lie the officers' quarters, powder magazine, and barracks, while the old palace is now utilized as an arsenal. An enclosure and garden just inside the gateway contains the celebrated pillar of Asoka, which bears an edict of this great Buddhist Emperor, circ. 240 B.C. The pillar was further inscribed in the 2nd century A.D. with a record of Samudra Gupta's victories and sovereignty over the various nations of India. It was re-erected by the Mughal Emperor Jahangir, who added a Persian legend, to commemorate his accession in 1605 A.D. Finally, it was set up in its present position by a British officer in 1838. Near the pillar stands the subterranean temple which covers the undying Banian tree. This building, dedicated to Siva, passes as the traditional place where the Saraswati, or Sarsuti, unites with the Ganges and the Jumna. The moisture on the walls of the underground chamber affords sufficient proof of its existence for the satisfaction of devotees. The Khusru Bagh, or garden and mausoleum of Prince Khusru, stands close to the railway station. The tomb consists of a handsome domed building, in the style of the Taj, the interior being painted with birds and flowers. Two minor mausoleums occupy sites in its neighbourhood. Among noteworthy modern buildings are the Government offices and courts, the European Barracks, the Roman Catholic Cathedral, Trinity Church, and the Thornhill and Mayne Memorial, containing the library and museum. The Muir Central College at Allahabad is the chief educational establishment of the North-Western Provinces. Sir W. Muir instituted the scheme, and Lord Northbrook laid the foundation-stone in 1874. The Mayo Memorial and Town Hall completes the list of handsome public buildings. Government House stands in a park-like enclosure on slightly rising ground, and has a central suite of\npublic rooms, with a long curved wing on either side containing the private apartments. The Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d Central Jail at N\u00e1in\u00ed is one of the largest prisons in India, and admirably managed.\n\nAllah\u00e1b\u00e1d is not famous for any particular trade or manufacture, but it has long been a mart of considerable general importance; and since the formation of the railway system of Upper India enormous quantities of goods pass through the town. There is a local trade in gold and silver ornaments; but Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d is rather an exchange mart for the purchase and sale of goods produced at other places, than a d\u00e9p\u00f4t for articles manufactured within the city itself. A great religious fair, known as the Magh Mel\u00e1, is held in December and January on the plain near the fort, just above the junction of the Ganges and the Jumna. It is one of the largest in the Province, being ordinarily visited by about 250,000 persons; but at the great fair held every twelfth year, the Kumbh Mela, as many as a million pilgrims are present at one time. The great bathing-day is at the new moon, but pilgrims and traders attend the sacred spot throughout the whole month. The religious ablutions are presided over by a peculiar class of Br\u00e1hmans, who bear a bad character for turbulence and licentiousness.\n\nThe local administration of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d is conducted by a municipal board, under the Municipal Act of 1883 for the North-Western Provinces. In 1880-81 the total municipal revenue amounted to \u00a322,248 (of which \u00a315,104 was derived from octroi), while the gross expenditure was \u00a321,330.

Lat. 24\u00b0 21' N., long. 69\u00b0 11' E. A long bank of earth, partly saline, mixed with sand and shells; about 50 miles in length, and in places 16 miles broad. It was upheaved by the earthquake of 1819, across the Pur\u00e1n\u00e1 branch of the Indus. In 1826, an overflow of the Indus breached the Band, the waters expanding, just below the cutting, into a vast lake (called by Burnes the 'Lake of Sidree'), now merged in the Rann of Cutch (Kachchh).\n\n**Allahganj.**\u2014Town in Aligarh tahsil, Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces, situated on the Rohilkhand Trunk road, 13 miles north-north-east of Fatehgarh town. The town, or rather village, contains a police station, post-office, village school, and a sar\u00e1i or inn for native travellers. A market is held twice a week, but the sales are confined to the ordinary trade in grain and cloth. An encamping ground outside the village marks the first stage for troops marching to Sh\u00e1jh\u00e1h\u00e1npur or Bareli.\n\n**Allan-myo.**\u2014Frontier town, Thayet District, British Burma. On left bank of the Irawadi (Irrawaddy) and close to the old Burmese town\nof Myedeh. Lat. $19^\\circ 21' 25''$ N., long. $95^\\circ 17' 30''$ E. Built during the Burmese War, it has rapidly risen in importance, and is now a flourishing seat of export trade for a large tract on the east of the Irawadi. Called after Major Allan, of the Madras Army, who demarcated the adjoining boundary line between British and Independent Burma. The residence of an Assistant Commissioner. Population (1881) 5825; namely, Buddhists, 5403; Muhammadans, 144; Hindus, 89; and Christians, 189.\n\n**Alleppi (Aulapolay, Allapalli).**\u2014Chief port and second largest town in Travancore State, Madras Presidency. Lat. $9^\\circ 29' 45''$ N., long. $76^\\circ 22' 31''$ E.; population about 30,000. Situated on the coast 33 miles south of Cochin, and 464 from Madras; it lies between the sea and an extensive tract of paddy-fields bordering the backwater, which here forms an extensive lake. Safe roadstead all the year round. The export trade has an average annual value of \u00a3220,446, and consists chiefly of vegetable produce, coffee, cardamoms, ginger, pepper, cocoa-nuts, coir, and fish. Alleppi is a depot for the products of the Travancore forests, and is the seat of two coir matting manufactories. The average annual import trade amounts in value to \u00a3157,476. The harbour returns for 1880\u201381 show a total of 323 ships of all kinds as having called, aggregating a tonnage of 172,709. Excellent anchorage always available; for although there is no protecting headland, a very remarkable mud bank, or floating mud island, of about $1\\frac{1}{2}$ mile in length, breaks the force of the roughest seas, and ensures shelter to vessels in the roadstead. The lighthouse, 85 feet high, bears a revolving white light, visible 18 miles out at sea.\n\nThe canal connecting the port with the great backwater to the north-east, passes through the centre of the town, at right angles to all the main streets, which cross it by seven bridges. A tramway, worked by coolies, conveys heavy goods from the end of the iron pier, newly constructed, to the warehouses. The soil on which the town is built is sandy; the general health is good; average mean temperature, $82^\\circ$. Among the public buildings are the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja\u2019s palace, the zil\u00e1 and munsif\u2019s courts, hospital, school, travellers\u2019 bungalow, postal, telegraph, and customs offices; also a school and a church, built by Protestant missionaries. To the last is attached a small Christian community.\n\nBartolomeo records that Alleppi was opened to foreign trade in 1762, and mentions the canal, from the port to the backwater, as being then in existence. In 1809 a detachment of European soldiers and Company\u2019s Sepoys, who had halted here on their way up the coast, were treacherously massacred by the Nairs.\n\n**Allur (or Pantalalliru).**\u2014Town in Nellore District, Madras Presidency. Lat. $14^\\circ 41' 30''$ N., long. $80^\\circ 5' 21''$ E.; houses, 1061;\npopulation (1881) 5190,\u2014mainly rice cultivators; three fine tanks provide ample irrigation. Sub-magistrate's court, post-office.\n\n**All\u00far cum Kottapatnam (Ak\u00fala All\u00far).**\u2014Village and port on the sea-coast, in Nellore District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 15\u00b0 27' (All\u00far) and 15\u00b0 26' 40\" (Kottapatnam) N., long. 80\u00b0 9' 45\" (All\u00far) and 80\u00b0 12' 15\" (Kottapatnam) E. Population (1881) 6267, nearly 30 per cent. being of the trading caste of Kamattis; houses, 1378. The export trade consists chiefly in the dry grains and oil-seeds of Cumbum (Kambam), Dup\u00e1c, and the Addanki country. The coast canal from Madras passes through the town. It is the station of a superintendent of sea customs and of a sub-magistrate.\n\n**Almodh.**\u2014Chiefship in Chhindw\u00e1ra District, Central Provinces, consisting of 52 villages, situated among the Mah\u00e1deo Hills, between 22\u00b0 17' and 22\u00b0 25' N. lat. and between 78\u00b0 18' and 78\u00b0 30' E. long. Area, 52 square miles; occupied houses, 565; total population (1881) 3133, namely 1647 males and 1486 females. The j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1r is one of the Bhop\u00e1s or hereditary guardians of the Mah\u00e1deo temples. He receives from the Government an annual allowance of \u00a317 in lieu of pilgrim tax, and pays an annual tribute of \u00a33, 10s. od. Almodh village is a mere hamlet of 59 houses, picturesquely situated at a high elevation. It is, however, very inaccessible from all sides, and the j\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1r has removed his residence to a more populous village at the foot of the hills.\n\n**Almora.**\u2014Chief town and administrative head-quarters of Kumaun District, North-Western Provinces; 5494 feet above sea level. Lat. 29\u00b0 35' 16\" N., long, 79\u00b0 41' 16\" E.; population (1881) 7390 (including the cantonments), comprising 6323 Hindus, 866 Muhammadans, and 201 Christians. The population within municipal limits in 1881 was only 4813. It stands on the crest of a ridge, and for centuries formed one of the strongholds of its native rulers, in whose history it played an important part. In 1744, the aggressions of the Rohill\u00e1s sent a Muhammadan force for the first time into Kum\u00e1un. They captured and plundered Almora, but after a few months retired, disgusted with the poverty of the country and the rigours of the climate. The country round Almora again formed an important strategical centre in the Gurkh\u00e1 War of 1815, which was concluded by the evacuation of the post on the 26th of April, after a heavy cannonade by Colonel Nicholls, and the surrender of the town and Kum\u00e1un to the British power. Almora is a substantially-built and prosperous little town, and the local demand for labour is so great that a hillman can pay his whole land tax for a year by a week's work at the station. Municipal revenue, chiefly from house tax, in 1881, \u00a3517; expenditure, \u00a3443.\n\n**Al\u00far.**\u2014Village in Hassan District, Mysore State, 7 miles west of Hassan. Lat. 12\u00b0 59' N., long. 76\u00b0 3' E.; population (1881) 853. Chief rice mart of Hassan District.\nAl\u00far.\u2014T\u00e1luk of Bellary District, Madras Presidency. Area, 646 square miles, containing 107 villages, and 12,039 occupied houses; population (1881) 65,586 (namely, 33,212 males and 32,374 females), of whom 8 per cent. were Muhammadans. Land revenue (1882-83), \u00a322,201; cost of administration, \u00a3745; number of criminal courts, 2; police stations, 6; police strength, 49 men. The t\u00e1luk is within the civil jurisdiction of the Adoni munsif. Of the total acreage (405,530) about 90 per cent. is under cultivation, 341,396 acres being 'dry,' and only 652 'wet.' The large proportion under crops is due to the fact of the soil being of the best black cotton description, rendering this small t\u00e1luk one of the richest in the District; while the remarkably small area of 'wet' cultivation is due to the absence of irrigation channels and tanks, the only river, the Hagri, being almost useless for agricultural purposes, from its wide sandy margins and shifting bed. The dead level of the country, too, makes artificial storage extremely difficult; hence there is not a single tank of any size. The principal crops are cotton and cholum, the centre of the trade for the former being at Mol\u00e1g\u00e1velli. About 60 miles of road intersect the t\u00e1luk and connect the chief towns, Al\u00far, Hariv\u00e1nam, Mol\u00e1g\u00e1velli, Chikka Hott\u00far, Holl\u00e1lg\u00fand\u00ed, and Chipp\u00e1giri.\n\nAl\u00far.\u2014Town on the Trunk Road in the Al\u00far t\u00e1luk, Bellary District, Madras Presidency. Population (1881) 2021. Except as the headquarters of the t\u00e1luk, of no importance. Travellers' bungalow, several minor official establishments, police station, grant-in-aid school.\n\nAlv\u00e1rkurichchi (Alw\u00e1rtir\u00fanagari).\u2014Town in Tinneveli District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 8\u00b0 47' 45\" N., long 77\u00b0 25' 45\" E.; population (1881) 5956; namely, 5799 Hindus, 16 Muhammadans, and 141 Christians. Situated on the right bank of the Tambraparni river, 19 miles south-east of Tinneveli.\n\nAlwa (Alava).\u2014Petty State of the Sankhera-Mew\u00e1s, in Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha, Bombay Presidency. Area, 6 square miles; estimated revenue, \u00a3600. The Chief is a Chauh\u00e1n R\u00e1jput, with the title of Th\u00e1kur, and pays tribute of \u00a36, 14s. to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda.\n\nAlwar.\u2014State in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na Agency and the Government of India. It was, in the early days of the East India Company, known as Machery (Mach\u00e1ri), from a town of that name formerly the residence of the R\u00e1o R\u00e1j\u00e1s. Bounded on the north by the British District of Gurg\u00e1on, the B\u00e1wal pargan\u00e1 of N\u00e1bh\u00e1 State, and the Kot K\u00e1sim pargan\u00e1 of Jaipur (Jeypore); on the east by the State of Bhartpur, and Gurg\u00e1on District; on the south and west by the State of Jaipur; situated between lat. 27\u00b0 5' and 28\u00b0 15' N., long. 76\u00b0 10' and 77\u00b0 15' E. Number of villages, 1806. Area, 3024 square miles. Population (1881) 682,926, of whom 526,115 were Hindus, 151,727 Musalm\u00e1ns, 90 Christians, and 4994\nJains, giving an average of 225\u00b78 souls to the square mile; the number of inhabited houses returned at the same time was 101,348. The Meos are the most important race in the State, and the agricultural portion of them is considerably more than double any other class of cultivators, except Cham\u00e1rs. They occupy about half the territory, mainly in the north and east, and own some 448 villages. They are divided into 52 clans, of which the 12 largest are called P\u00e1ls, and the smaller Gots. Claiming to be of R\u00e1jput origin, the Meos are now all Musalm\u00e1ns in name; but their village deities are the same as those of Hindus, and they observe several Hindu festivals, in addition to Muhammadan. As agriculturists they are inferior to their Hindu neighbours. The R\u00e1jputs (26,889), though the ruling class, do not form a twentieth of the population of the State. The Br\u00e1hmans were returned at 75,965, of whom about half were agriculturists. The other classes of Hindus returned were\u2014J\u00e1ts, 29,725; Ah\u00edrs, 50,942; G\u00fajars, 39,826; Baniy\u00e1s, or trading castes, 42,212; Cham\u00e1rs, 69,201; Balais, 6616; others, 149,579; and M\u00ednas, 38,164. There are no very wealthy people in the State, and only a few rich; these last are found not in the city of Alwar, but in the villages of R\u00e1jgarh and B\u00e1s of the Kishangarh pargan\u00e1.\n\nRidges of rocky and precipitous hills, generally parallel and lying north and south, are a feature observable throughout the whole State, which, however, to the north and east is generally open. The hills attain a height of nearly 2400 feet above the level of the sea, and about 1600 feet above the level of the surrounding country. The S\u00e1bi is the chief stream in the State, and forms for 16 miles the western boundary. Owing to its high banks it is useless for irrigation; it dries up after the rains. A fine railway iron bridge, resting on masonry piers, crosses it just beyond the Alwar border. The other streams are the R\u00faparel, Chuh\u00e1r Sidh, and Lindwa; the two former are valuable irrigation channels. Slate, marble (black, white, and pink), slate-coloured sandstone, talc, red ochre, iron, copper, lead, and potash, are produced in abundance in the hills, and in the vicinity of the capital. Large and small game of every kind abound in the State.\n\nOriginally, Alwar State consisted of petty chiefships, which till the middle of the last century owed allegiance to Jaipur and Bhartpur. The founder of the present family was Prat\u00e1p Singh, a Nar\u00faka R\u00e1jput, who at first possessed but two villages and a half, Mach\u00e1ri being one of them. During the minority of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Jaipur, and while J\u00e1ts, Mughals, and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s were contending with each other, he succeeded, between 1771 and 1776, in establishing independent power in the greater part of the territory which now forms the southern half of the State. In the war carried on by M\u00edrza Naj\u00edf Kh\u00e1n against the J\u00e1ts, he united his forces at an opportune moment with those of the\nformer, and aided him in defeating the enemy at Bars\u00e1na and at Dig (Deeg). As a reward for his services, he obtained the title of R\u00e1o R\u00e1j\u00e1, and a sanad authorizing him to hold Mach\u00e1ri direct. In 1776 he took advantage of the weakness of Bhartpur, to wrest from the J\u00e1ts the town and fort of Alwar. His brethren of the Nar\u00faka clan of R\u00e1jputs then acknowledged him as their chief. He was succeeded by his adopted son Bakht\u00e1war Singh, during whose time the country was overrun by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. At the commencement of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 war of 1803\u20136, Bakht\u00e1war Singh allied himself with the British Government; and the famous battle of Lasw\u00e1ri, in which Sindhia\u2019s forces were completely defeated by Lord Lake, was fought about 17 miles east of the town of Alwar. After this campaign, the British Government conferred on Bakht\u00e1war Singh the northern Districts of the present State, and thereby raised his revenue from 7 to 10 l\u00e1khs. The new Districts lay in the tract well known in Mughal history as Mew\u00e1t, or the country of the Meos.\n\nIn 1803, the Chief of Alwar accepted the protection of the British Government; and a treaty of alliance, offensive and defensive, was concluded, on the basis that Alwar should pay no tribute, but that its troops should co-operate with the British Government when required. In 1811, it was found that intrigues, threatening the independence of Jaipur, were being carried on in Alwar, with the connivance of the Chief; and that the existing treaty approached too nearly to an equal alliance to allow of Government interference. A fresh engagement was therefore made, by which the R\u00e1o R\u00e1j\u00e1 was expressly prohibited from political intercourse with other States. In 1812, Bakht\u00e1war Singh took possession of the forts of Dhobi and Sikr\u00e1wa, with adjoining territory belonging to Jaipur, and refused to restore them on the remonstrance of the Resident at Delhi. A British force was moved against him; but on its arrival within one march of his capital, Bakht\u00e1war Singh yielded, and restored the usurped territory. Bakht\u00e1war Singh was succeeded by his nephew and adopted son, Bani Singh; but as he had also left an illegitimate son, Balwant Singh, a dispute arose about the succession, and the British Government advised a suitable provision being made for Balwant Singh. The advice was disregarded, and an attempt was made to murder Balwant Singh\u2019s chief supporter, when staying with the British Resident. Accordingly, after the capture of Bhartpur in January 1827, a force advanced towards Alwar, and Bani Singh was compelled to make over to Balwant Singh the northern tracts, which in Lord Lake\u2019s time had been conferred upon his father. Balwant Singh died childless in 1845, and his possessions then reverted to Alwar. Bani Singh died in 1857, after the outbreak of the Mutiny. An Alwar contingent was sent towards Agra to co-operate with the British forces, but it was headed by a traitor, who betrayed it to the rebels, and it was dispersed.\nBani Singh was succeeded by his son Sheod\u00e1n Singh, at that time thirteen years of age. The Muhammadan ministers obtained an ascendency over the young chief, which caused a rising of the R\u00e1jput nobles to expel them. On this, it was considered advisable to appoint a Political Agent at Alwar, to advise and assist the council of regency during the young chief's minority. Soon after Sheod\u00e1n Singh's accession to power, the affairs of the State fell into confusion, and discontent was shown by insurrection. In 1870, a council of management, presided over by a British officer, was appointed, by whom the State was governed. Sheod\u00e1n Singh died in 1874, without any legitimate descendant, either lineal or adopted, and it was considered advisable that a ruler should be selected from the collateral branches of the ruling family. The choice between those having the strongest claims was left to the twelve Kotris, as the Naruka families are called, and the selection fell upon Th\u00e1kur Mangal Singh of the Th\u00e1na family. The Chief of Alwar, who has the title of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1o R\u00e1j\u00e1, enjoys the right of adoption, and is entitled to a salute of 15 guns. In 1866, an extradition treaty was concluded with Alwar. British coin has been introduced into the State. In 1865, the R\u00e1j\u00e1 agreed to give the land required for railway purposes free of cost, and to compensate the owners. He also consented to cede full jurisdiction in such land, short of sovereign rights, to the British Government, and to surrender all transit and other duties on goods passing through. The Delhi branch of the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na State Railway now runs through the State, nearly bisecting it from north to south, and joins the line from Agra to Jaipur at Bandikui Junction, which is just beyond the southern boundary of the State. Several roads are in course of construction as feeders to the railway. Of the fairs held in the State the most important are those at Bil\u00e1li, at Chuhar Sidh, and at the capital.\n\nFor fiscal purposes Alwar State is divided into 14 t\u00e1sils, viz. Tij\u00e1ra, Kishangarh, Mand\u00e1war, Bahror, Govindgarh, R\u00e1mgarh, Alwar, B\u00e1ns\u00far, Katumbar, Lachhmangarh, R\u00e1jgarh, Th\u00e1na Gh\u00e1zi, Baldeogarh, and Partabgarh. Fifty-five per cent. of the whole area of the State is under cultivation, half being irrigated; the crops produced are the millets bajra and jo\u00e1r, barley, gram, cotton, Indian corn, wheat, pulses, oil-seeds, tobacco, sugar-cane, and opium. During the last century and a quarter no less than ten famines have occurred in Alwar, of which five were specially severe. The State also suffers occasionally from floods and locusts. The manufacture of iron was in former times a great industry in the State, but it has fallen off of late years, the out-turn at the present time being about 660 to 700 tons a year; and since the introduction of British coin for the cumbrous takka, the production of copper has also declined. The manufactures are not of much account; a good deal of paper is made at Tij\u00e1ra, and inferior\nglass from a peculiar earth, a few miles east of the capital. The imports are sugar, rice, salt, and piece goods.\n\nThe revenue of the State in 1875 was \u00a3232,431; expenditure, \u00a3201,329; the government was carried on by a council of administration under the Presidency of the Chief, with three Courts, appellate, revenue, and criminal. There are several schools in the State, and three dispensaries at Alwar city, Tij\u00e1ra, and R\u00e1jgarh, for each of which a cess of one per cent. is levied. Alwar pays no tribute or contribution to local contingents. The Chief maintains an army of 1800 cavalry, 4750 infantry, 10 field and 290 other guns, and 369 artillerymen. [For further information, see Major Powlett's Gazetteer of Alwar (edition 1878), and the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na Gazetteer, vol. iii., Alwar Section, by Major Powlett (1880).]\n\nAlwar.\u2014Capital of the Native State of the same name, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na; situated nearly in the centre of the State. Two modes of deriving its name are current: one, that it was anciently called Alpur, or 'strong city;' the other, that by an interchange of letters, it is a form of the word Arbal, the name of the main chain with which the hills near the city are connected. The first historical mention of the town is in Ferishta, who speaks of a R\u00e1jput of Alwar contending with the Ajmere R\u00e1jputs A.D. 1195. The city is protected by a rampart and a moat on all sides, except where the rocky hill range, crowned by the fort, secures it from attack. There are five gates, and the streets are well paved. The chief buildings within the city are\u2014(1) the R\u00e1j\u00e1's palace; (2) the cenotaph of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Bakht\u00e1w\u00e1r Singh; (3) the temple of Jagann\u00e1th; (4) the court-house and revenue office; (5) an ancient tomb, said to be that of one Tarang Sult\u00e1n, brother of the Emperor Firoz Sh\u00e1h, called the Tripolia. The Muhammadan shrine of most account in the city is that of one Bhikan, after whom a street has been named. Just 1000 feet above the Tripolia is the fort (lat. 27\u00b0 34' 4\" N., long. 76\u00b0 38' 28\" E.), containing a palace and other buildings, erected chiefly by the first two Nar\u00faka rulers of Alwar. Its ramparts extend along the hill-top and across the valley for about 2 miles. It is said to have been built by Nikumbh or Nikumpa R\u00e1jputs, and has undoubtedly been in the hands successively of Kh\u00e1nz\u00e1d\u00e1s, Mughals, Path\u00e1ns, J\u00e1ts, and Nar\u00fakas. Below the fort are two important outworks, called respectively the Chitanki and the K\u00e1b\u00fal Khurd. There are also five considerable temples belonging to the Jain and Saraogi sects, of whom there are about 400 families. The Lake of Siliserh, more than a mile in length, and about 400 yards in average width, is 9 miles south-west of the city; and to an aqueduct which brings its waters to Alwar is due the beauty of the environs. The lake abounds with fish, and much game is to be found in the neighbourhood; it is a favourite resort of pleasure parties. The Banni Bil\u00e1s palace and\ngarden, situated about a mile from the town, are famous for their picturesque situation. The Residency,\u2014about a mile and a half from the city,\u2014a fine tank for the use of the town, and an excellent jail on the Tij\u00e1ra road, are the principal works in the suburbs, and good metal roads, in and around the town, keep up communications in every direction. Major Powlett (Gazetteer of Alwar, London, 1878) mentions many other interesting places of public resort in the neighbourhood of the city. The same authority states that in 1872 the population of the city and suburbs was 52,357, and that the most numerous classes are Br\u00e1hmans, Baniy\u00e1s, and Cham\u00e1rs. In 1881 the Census returned a total population of 49,867; namely, 37,100 Hindus, 12,680 Muham-madans, and 87 others.\n\n**Alwaye.**\u2014Town in Kannutan\u00e1d District, Travancore State, Madras Presidency. Lat. 10\u00b0 6' 50\" N., long. 76\u00b0 23' 31\" E.; population (1881) under 3000. The Portuguese and Dutch selected it as the sanitarium of Cochin, and such it is still considered. Situated on the river Alwaye (Pery\u00e1r), 20 miles from Cochin.\n\n**Alwaye.**\u2014River in Cochin State, Madras Presidency; named by the early Portuguese the \u2018Fiera d\u2019Alva.\u2019 It forms a branch of the Pery\u00e1r, which it joins at Alwaye town, and enters the Cochin estuary a few miles from that city. Cochin derives its drinking water from the Alwaye river.\n\n**Am\u00e1l\u00e1.**\u2014D\u00e1ng State, Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency. Area 200 square miles; population about 4700. Estimated gross revenue, \u00a3300. The Chief, a Bhil, lives at Modal, and has no patent allowing adoption, the family following the rule of primogeniture. Owing to the wild and unhealthy nature of the country, the internal resources of the State are practically unknown. The inhabitants are ignorant and superstitious, and make little or no progress.\n\n**Amal\u00e1p\u00faram.**\u2014Town in Bellary District, Madras Presidency. Population (1881) 3165.\n\n**Amal\u00e1p\u00faram.**\u2014T\u00e1luk of God\u00e1vari District, Madras Presidency.

It is irrigated by three navigable main canals from the anicut, namely the Lolla, the Gaun\u00e1war\u00e1m, and the Amal\u00e1p\u00faram, which supply water to all the various branch channels. The country is flat, very rich and productive, and the central part is noted for its cocoa-nut, areca-nut, and plantain plantations. Several branches of the God\u00e1vari flow through it or along its border, in their course to the sea. In the bed of one, the Vasishta God\u00e1vari, there are valuable islands formed by accumulated deposits of silt. No special industry; the principal trade\nis in cocoa-nuts and oil, areca-nuts, paddy, grain, oil-seeds, cloth, and cotton twist, exported by the canals to Cocan\u00e1da, R\u00e1j\u00e1mahendri (Rajahmundry), and Ellore. No imports except salt. The chief towns are Amal\u00e1p\u00faram, Palivela, R\u00e1li, and Amb\u00e1jipetta.\n\n**Amal\u00e1p\u00faram** ('The Sinless City').\u2014Town in the t\u00e1luk of the same name, in God\u00e1vari District, Madras Presidency.

Area, 527 square miles, with 2 towns and 223 villages. Population (1881) 88,986, or 169 to the square mile, mainly agriculturists. Hindus numbered 75,944; Muhammadans, 6812; 'others,' 7130; occupied houses, 14,196. Of the total area, 82 per cent. is arable land, 13 per cent. is waste, and the remainder is taken up by village sites, roads, and rivers. Flat for the most part, and widely tilled in the north; the southern portion, broken by a low chain of hills, being less cultivated. The T\u00e1pti forms the northern boundary for about 20 miles, and with its tributaries, the Bori and P\u00e1njhr\u00e1, affords an unfailing supply of water for irrigation. Contains 223 villages with 3237 working wells, and, in addition to the chief town, the following market towns, where weekly marts are held: Bet\u00e1wad, Bah\u00e1durpur, V\u00e1rsi, and Shir\u00e1s\u00e1la.

On the weekly market-day, cocoons and raw silk to the value of \u00a32000 to \u00a35000 are often sold. The rates for cocoons at each bandh or breeding season are fixed here for the whole District.\n\n**Am\u00e1pur (Am\u00e1npur).**\u2014Small trading town in K\u00e1sganj tahsil, Etah District, North-Western Provinces, situated on the Delhi and Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d road, 13\u00bd miles from Etah town. The town is the seat of a considerable trade in cotton, grain, and indigo seed, and contains several wealthy bankers and merchants; although it has declined in importance since the opening of the Grand Trunk road. A small municipal income, in the shape of a house-tax, is levied for police and conservancy purposes, under the provisions of Act xx. of 1856.\n\n**Amar\u00e1pura ('The City of the Gods').**\u2014A town of Independent Burma, situated on the right bank of the Irawadi (Irrawaddy) river. Lat. 21\u00b0 57' N., long. 73\u00b0 4' E. It was founded in 1783, as a new capital for the Burmese kingdom. It increased rapidly in size, and in 1810 its population was estimated at 170,000; but in that year the town was destroyed by fire, and this disaster, together with the removal of the Native Court in 1819, caused a decline in the prosperity of the place. It remained the capital till 1822. In 1827 its population was calculated at only 30,000. An estimate made by Major Grant Allan from an enumeration of the houses (in 1835) gave the population within the walls at 26,670, or, including the immediate suburbs, 90,000. Since then it has suffered another severe calamity from an earthquake, which\nin 1839 destroyed the greater part of the city. It again became the capital about 1838, soon after the accession of Tharawaddi in 1837; and it had been re-occupied before the earthquake of 1839. The late king (who recently died in 1878) removed the seat of his government to Mandalay, about 1860. Amar\u00e1pura is regularly laid out; but, with the exception of a few temples, the town is built only of bamboos, although several of the buildings, being richly gilt, have a showy appearance. The most remarkable edifice is a celebrated temple, adorned with 250 lofty pillars of gilt wood, and containing a colossal bronze statue of Buddha. The remains of the palace of the Burmese monarchs still exist in the centre of the town. During the time of its prosperity, Amar\u00e1pura was defended by a rampart and a large square citadel, with a broad moat, the walls being 7000 feet long and 20 feet high, with a bastion at each corner. Whilst it was the capital, a very few of the principal houses were built of timber, the others being of bamboo. The Chinese quarter was of brick.\n\n**Amar\u00e1p\u00faram.**\u2014Town in Anant\u00e1pur District, Madras Presidency.\n\n\u2014See AMRAPUR.\n\n**Amarkantak.**\u2014Hill in Rew\u00e1 State, Baghelkhand; 3493 feet above sea level. Lat. 22\u00b0 40' 15\" N., long. 81\u00b0 48' 15\" E. The hill forms a portion of the S\u00e1tpura range, and its summit consists of an extensive plateau. Interesting for its temples around the sources of the sacred river Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda), and for its waterfalls.\n\n**Amarn\u00e1th** (or Ambarn\u00e1th, literally 'Immortal Lord,' a name of Siva).\u2014Small village of about 300 inhabitants, in Th\u00e1n\u00e1 District, Bombay Presidency. The old Hindu temple, situated in a pretty valley less than a mile east of the village, is interesting as a specimen of genuine Hindu architecture, possibly dating as far back as the 11th century A.D. An inscription found on it is dated Sak 982 (A.D. 1060). It was probably erected by M\u00e1mv\u00e1nir\u00e1j\u00e1, the son of Chitt\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1deva, a M\u00e1h\u00e1mandalessw\u00e1ra, or feudatory king of the Konkan, under the Ch\u00e1lukya of Kaly\u00e1n, in the Deccan. The temple itself faces the west, but the mandap or antar\u00e1l\u00e1, the entrance hall, has also doors to the north and south. Each of the three doors has a porch, approached by four or five steps, and supported by four nearly square pillars\u2014two of them attached to the wall. The mandap is 22 feet 9 inches square. The roof of the hall is supported by four very elaborately carved columns. In their details no two of them are exactly alike; but, like the pillars in the cave temples of Ajant\u00e1, they have been wrought in pairs, the pair next the shrine being if possible the richer. The gahb\u00e1r\u00e1 or shrine, which is also square, measures 13 feet 8 inches each way. It appears to have been stripped of its ornamentation, and now only contains the remains of a small linga, sunk in the floor. The outside of the building is beautifully carved. The principal sculptures are,\nthree-headed figure with a female on his knee, probably intended to represent Mah\u00e1deva and P\u00e1rvat\u00ed; and on the south-east side of the Vim\u00e1n\u00e1, K\u00e1l\u00ed. The sculpture, both on the pillars of the hall and round the outside, shows a skill not surpassed by any temple in the Presidency. [For a more detailed account, illustrated with fifteen plates, see Indian Antiquary, vol. iii. pp. 316 ff. (Nov. 1874), and vol. xiv. of the Bombay Gazetteer, pp. 2 to 8.]\n\n**Amarn\u00e1th.**\u2014Cave in Kashmir State, Punjab; situated among the mountains which bound that territory on the north-east. Lat. $34^\\circ 15' N.$, long. $75^\\circ 49' E$. It consists of a natural opening in a gypsum rock, about 30 yards in height and 20 in depth, and is held to be the dwelling-place of the god Siva. Dr. Vigne in his *Travels in Kashmir* (1842) mentions this as a resort of pilgrims, whose prayers are supposed to be favourably answered if the pigeons which inhabit its recesses fly out at the sound of their tumultuous supplications. A great fair is annually held here at the Saluna festival. The water falling from the roof forms a stalagmitic column, said to form the image of the god, and believed by the worshippers to wax and wane along with the moon.\n\n**Amarw\u00e1ra.**\u2014Village in Chhindw\u00e1ra District, Central Provinces, situated on the road to Narsinghpur. Government school, police station.\n\n**Amatti** (or Colepett).\u2014Town in Coorg, situated in the Coffee District, and known as the 'Bamboo,' 6 miles from Virajendrapett, on the high road to Mysore. Large weekly market on Sundays, frequented by the coolies from the adjoining estates. Head-quarters of the P\u00e1rpattig\u00e1r of the N\u00e1d. Post-office and school with 31 pupils. Population (1881) 667. Distant from Merk\u00e1ra 20 miles.\n\n**Amb.**\u2014Estate (j\u00e1g\u00edr) in the extreme north-western corner of Haz\u00e1ra District, Punjab, and separated from independent Path\u00e1n country by the Indus. It consists of 204 square miles of mountain country, which was granted in perpetuity to the family of the Naw\u00e1b, at the time of the annexation of the Punjab. The present Naw\u00e1b is described as one of the most trustworthy of the border chieftains. He rendered good service to the British during the operations in the Agror valley in 1868, in reward for which he was created a C.S.I. Besides the j\u00e1g\u00edr within Haz\u00e1ra District, which is under ordinary British administration, the Naw\u00e1b holds as feudal territory the cis-Indus tract of Tan\u00e1wal in the north-west corner of the District, and also the entirely independent State of Amb beyond the Indus. The village of Amb, on the right bank of the river, contains about 300 houses, built of stone and sand. It is situated on the south of a ravine, at the north of which is a small fort containing the Naw\u00e1b's residence.\nAmb\u00e1d.\u2014T\u00e1luk in Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d territory, Nizam\u2019s Dominions. Situated in the north-west. Area, 860 square miles. Population (1881) 116,168, of whom 58,768 are males and 57,400 females; 56 per cent. of the total population are agriculturists. Of the area, 685 square miles are cultivated, 138 cultivable, and 37 uncultivable waste. Land revenue, \u00a332,723. This amount is subject to revision, as a new settlement is being introduced (1883). Chief towns of the t\u00e1luk are, Amb\u00e1d (4000), Jamkher (3418), Rohilgarh (946), Vih\u00e1mandav (2234), G\u00fcnsaungi (1318), Ektuni (1030). The t\u00e1luk contains 241 villages, 22 of which are alienated. After the final subjugation of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s by the British, the District of Amb\u00e1d, with others, passed under British rule for a short period, until its cession to the Niz\u00e1m, under whom it was made a circ\u00e1r and included the following Districts: Ver\u00fal, Fulamberi, Hars\u00fal, Wal\u00faj, Chikhli, J\u00e1lna, Rakshasbh\u00e1wan, and Badnapur. In 1862 Amb\u00e1d was formed into a zil\u00e1 having under its jurisdiction six t\u00e1luks, viz. Pathri, Purbh\u00e1ni, Jaln\u00e1pur, Narsi, Paitan, and Amb\u00e1d. Four years later this new arrangement was abandoned, the head-quarters of the District being removed to Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d, of which District Amb\u00e1d became a t\u00e1luk.\n\nAmb\u00e1d.\u2014Chief town and head-quarters of Amb\u00e1d t\u00e1luk, Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d territory, Nizam\u2019s Dominions. Situated near the centre of the t\u00e1luk, in an undulating plain, and surrounded on three sides by low hills. Tradition ascribes its foundation to a Hindu prince, named Amba, who, wearied of the cares of Government in his own State in Northern India, is said to have taken up his abode in a small cave to the east of the town, which he founded and named after himself. The site of the cave is now occupied by a handsome temple. The town once enjoyed great prosperity, of which it retains but a remnant now. Principal trade, cotton and grain. Population about 4000. Contains no buildings of any interest. There is a small fort in the eastern quarter, in which the tahs\u00edld\u00e1r resides and holds his court. Weekly market, held on Thursdays. An annual fair, lasting ten days, is held in connection with the temple at the cave, which is visited by several thousand people.\n\nAmb\u00e1g\u00e1rh Chauki.\u2014Chiefship or zamind\u00e1ri in Ch\u00e1nda District, Central Provinces, lying between 20\u00b0 35' and 20\u00b0 51' 20\" N. lat., and between 80\u00b0 31' 15\" and 80\u00b0 52' E. long.

The town contains a good many brick-built houses, and the bazar consists of a double roadway, with a centre line of poor-looking shops. The roads are well made and drained, and in places paved with brick. Ambahta was originally a cantonment for Mughal troops. It is a comparatively modern town, and contains two mosques dating from Humayun's reign. Police outpost, branch post-office, well-kept school.

Classified according to religion, the population consisted of\u2014Hindus, 997,280; Muhammadans, 525,012; Sikhs, 195,787; Jains, 3495; Christians, 7448; Buddhists, 4; Parsis, 6; and 'others,' 11. Of the total area of 3963 square miles, 2763 are assessed for Government revenue, of which 1775 are returned as cultivated, 405 cultivable, and the remainder uncultivable. Total Government assessment, including rates and cesses on the land, \u00a3181,235; rental (estimated) paid by the cultivators, including cesses, \u00a3478,026.\n\nAmbala (Umballa).\u2014District in the Lieut.-Governorship of the Punjab, lying between $29^\\circ 49'$ and $31^\\circ 12'$ N. lat., and between $76^\\circ 22'$ and $77^\\circ 39'$ E. long. Area, 2570 square miles; population in 1881, 1,067,263 souls. Ambala is the central District in the Division of the same name. It is bounded on the north-east by the Himalayas; on the north by the Sutlej; on the west by the Native State of Patiala and the District of Ludhiana; and on the south by the District of Karnal and the river Jumna. The administrative head-quarters are at Ambala City.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of Ambala forms a portion of the\nlevel plain intermediate between the Sutlej and the Indus, stretching along the foot of the Lower Him\u00e1layas. A strip of Pati\u00e1la territory, jutting into the District from the south-west, separates it into two unequal portions, connected only by a narrow isthmus immediately below the hills. Towards the Him\u00e1layas, the frontier is comparatively simple, as the first upward undulation of the great range generally marks the limits of the British domain, beyond which lies the Native State of N\u00e1han or Sirm\u00far (Sarmor). But at two points in its course our boundary projects into the hill country; once at its eastern extremity, on the bank of the Jumna, where a valuable upland timber forest lies within the British line; and again midway between the two rivers, nearly opposite the narrowest point, where our territory expands so as to include a large hill tract, known as the Kot\u00e1ha pargan\u00e1, and composed of two parallel ranges, the sources of the river Ghaggar. This mountainous region differs widely in its physical features and in the character of its inhabitants, from the level plain at its foot. It is covered by the forest of Morni, in whose midst, enclosed by projecting spurs, lie two remarkable lakes. A hill divides them from one another, but some hidden communication evidently exists between their basins, as the level of either is immediately affected by any withdrawal of water from its neighbour. The people regard them as sacred; and a ruined temple in honour of Krishna, which stands upon the bank of the larger lake, is the scene of a great annual festival. The village and fort of Morni lie considerably higher up the mountain-side. Below the hills, the face of the country assumes at once the appearance of a level plain. It has, however, a uniform slope towards the south-west; and near the hills its surface is broken at intervals by the beds of mountain torrents, which form the characteristic feature in the physical aspect of the District.\n\nBesides the great boundary streams of the Sutlej and the Jumna, each of whose beds passes through the various stages of boulders, shingle, and sand, the District is traversed in every part by innumerable minor channels. The Ghaggar rises in N\u00e1han State, passes through the Kot\u00e1ha pargan\u00e1, crosses the District at its narrowest point, and enters Pati\u00e1la almost immediately; but near the town of Amb\u00e1la it again touches on British territory, and skirts the border for a short distance. It is largely used for irrigation, the water being drawn off by means of artificial cuts. When in flood, the current is too dangerous for boats, and on all other occasions the stream is fordable. The Amb\u00e1la and Simla road crosses the river by a ford about half-way between Amb\u00e1la and K\u00e1lka. During the rains the mails are carried over on elephants. A tributary of the Ghaggar, the Saraswati or Sarsuti, once according to tradition an important river, but now largely desiccated by irrigation channels and the silting up of dams, runs through the heart of the southern tract. It rises in the low hills\njust beyond the border of the District in N\u00e1han State, and emerges into the plains at Z\u00e1dh Budri, a place esteemed sacred by all Hindus. A few miles after entering the plains, the river disappears for a time in the sand, but percolating underground, re-emerges about three miles farther south, at the village of Bh\u00e1wantpur. At Balchhapar it again sinks below the surface, but afterwards re-appears, and flows onward in a south-westerly direction, and after crossing Karn\u00e1l ultimately joins the Ghaggar in Pati\u00e1la territory. Amongst other streams may be mentioned the Chutang, Tangri, Bali\u00e1li, M\u00e1rkanda, Beg\u00e1na, Kush\u00e1la, Sukhia, and Sombh. The Western Jumna Canal takes its rise at H\u00e1thi K\u00fand in this District (where the Jumna finally debouches from the hills on its western bank), and runs parallel with the lessened stream till it reaches the Karn\u00e1l boundary. A section of the Sirhind Canal also passes through a portion of Amb\u00e1la District.\n\nThe aspect of the country is generally pleasing; the submontane tract being diversified by undulating slopes, while the plains are well wooded and abundantly interspersed with green mango groves. The neighbourhood of the hills, and the moisture imparted by the numerous torrents, give an air of freshness and beauty to the otherwise monotonous scenery. In clear weather, the Him\u00e1layas may be seen from any part of the District. The mango is common in the southern part of the District, where fine groves of these trees prove a source of considerable income to the landholders. The commonest timber tree is the k\u00edkar (Acacia arabica), which grows almost everywhere. The other indigenous trees are the p\u00edpal (Ficus religiosa), sir\u00eds (Acacia sirissa), t\u00fat (mulberry), s\u00e1l (Shorea robusta), bargat or banyan tree (Ficus indica), semhal (Bombax heptaphyllum), f\u00e1ris (Tamarix orientalis), and dh\u00e1k (Butea frondosa). There are several extensive forest areas. The most important, though not the largest, is the Kalesar forest, covering 13,917 acres, and composed of valuable s\u00e1l trees. Gold is said to be found in minute quantities among the sand washed down by some of the minor hill streams. The only mineral product, however, of any importance is limestone; large quantities of which are brought down by the streams from the hill, and form deposits, which are collected and burned. Game abounds in all the wilder tracts, and beasts of prey are also common. The reward for killing a tiger or leopard is 3os.; for cubs, 6s.; and for a wolf, 1os.\n\nHistory.\u2014Amb\u00e1la and its neighbourhood are intimately associated with the earliest dawn of Indian history. The strip of country included between the S\u00e1raswat\u00ed (Sarsuti) and the Ghaggar is the Holy Land of the Hindu faith, the first permanent home of the Aryans in India, and the spot where their religion took shape. Hence the sanctity of the S\u00e1raswat\u00ed even in modern times attracts the faithful, not only from neighbouring Districts, but even from Orissa and the remotest corners of\nBengal. Its banks are everywhere lined with shrines, but the towns of Thanesar and Pihewa form the chief centres of attraction; and a tank filled by the S\u00e1raswati at the former place is annually bathed in by some 300,000 persons. The country teems with traditions of the great conflict between the P\u00e1ndavas and the Kauravas, whose exploits are detailed in the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata. The earliest authentic information which we possess with reference to this District is, however, derived from the Itinerary of Hwen Thsang, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim of the 7th century. He found it the seat of a flourishing and civilised kingdom, having its capital at Srugna, a town identified by General Cunningham with the modern village of S\u00fagh, near Jag\u00e1dhri. The evidence of coins found on the spot in great abundance shows that Srugna continued to be occupied down to the time of the Muhamma-dan conquest.\n\nThe country around Amb\u00e1la, like the rest of Upper India, fell to the successive Muhammadan dynasties of Ghazni and Ghor, but has no special mention in the records of their conquests. About the middle of the 14th century, the Emperor F\u00edroz Sh\u00e1h constructed a canal to supply the town of Hiss\u00e1r, which probably coincided in the main with the present Western Jumna Canal. Under Akbar, Amb\u00e1la District formed part of the Subahat or Governorship of Sirhind. But the practical interest of the local annals begins with the rise of the Sikh principalities south of the Sutlej during the latter half of the 18th century. As the central power of the Empire relaxed under the blows of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s on the one side, and the Afgh\u00e1ns on the other, numerous Sikh marauders from the Punjab proper began to extend their encroachments beyond the Sutlej, and ere long acquired for themselves the heart of the country between that river and the Jumna. When the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 supremacy fell before the British in 1803, the whole tract was parcelled out among chiefs of various grades, from the powerful R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Pati\u00e1la, Jh\u00ednd, and N\u00e1bha down to the petty sard\u00e1r who had succeeded in securing by violence or fraud the possession of a few villages. But after Ranj\u00edt Singh began to consolidate the Sikh territories within the Punjab, he crossed the Sutlej in 1808, and demanded tribute from the cis-Sutlej chieftains.\n\nThus pressed, and fearing for themselves the fate which had overtaken their brethren, the Sikh princes combined to apply for aid to the British Government. The responsibility of protecting the minor States from their powerful neighbour was accepted by the British, and the treaty of 1809, between our Government and Ranj\u00edt Singh, secured them in future from encroachment on the north. Internal wars were strictly prohibited by a proclamation issued in 1811; but with this exception the powers and privileges of the chiefs remained untouched. Each native ruler, great or small, had civil, criminal, and fiscal jurisdiction\nwithin his own territory, subject only to the controlling authority of the Governor-General's Agent at Amb\u00e1la. No tribute was taken, nor was any special contingent demanded, although the R\u00e1j\u00e1s were bound in case of war to give active aid to the Government. The right to escheats was the sole return which we asked for our protection. The first Sikh war and the Sutlej campaign of 1845 gave Government an opportunity of testing the gratitude of the chieftains. Few of them, however, displayed their loyalty more conspicuously than by abstaining from open rebellion. Their previous conduct had not been such as to encourage Government in its policy towards them, while their mismanagement was amply testified by the universal satisfaction with which the peasantry of lapsed principalities accepted the British rule.\n\nA sweeping measure of reform was accordingly introduced, for the reduction of the privileges enjoyed by the Sikh chieftains. The Political Agency of Amb\u00e1la was transformed into a Commissionership, and the police jurisdiction was handed over to European officers. In June 1849, after the second Sikh war had brought the Punjab under our rule, the chiefs were finally deprived of all sovereign power. The revenues were still to be theirs, but the assessments were to be made by British officials and under British regulations. Even previous to this arrangement, portions of the modern District had lapsed to Government by death or forfeiture; and the reforms of 1849 brought Amb\u00e1la nearly to its present proportions. During the Mutiny of 1857, although incendiary fires and other disturbances gave much ground for alarm, especially at the first beginning of disaffection, no actual outbreak occurred, and the District was held throughout with little difficulty. In 1862, the dismemberment of Thanesar District brought three new pargan\u00e1s to Amb\u00e1la; and four years later, another exchange of territory finally gave it the existing area and boundaries.\n\n**Population.**\u2014In 1854, the population of Amb\u00e1la, including those portions of Thanesar which have since been incorporated with this District, amounted to 957,078 souls. In 1868, after the addition of Thanesar, it had risen to 1,028,418, on an area corresponding to the present District (2570 square miles). In 1881, the Census disclosed a total of 1,067,263, or an increase of 38,845 or 3\u00b76 per cent. during the thirteen years. The population in 1881 was distributed over 2570 square miles, with 2226 villages and towns, and 146,517 occupied and 54,873 unoccupied houses. Number of resident families, 251,649. From the above figures, the following averages may be deduced:\u2014Persons per square mile, 361; villages per square mile, 0\u00b787; houses per square mile, 78; persons per village, 479; persons per occupied house, 7\u00b728. Classified according to sex, there were\u2014males, 588,272; females, 478,991; proportion of males, 55\u00b711 per cent. The preponderance of the male sex was at one time greater, amounting in\n1854 to 56.32 per cent.; there has therefore been an increase of over 1 per cent. in the number of females as compared with males, which affords just ground for the belief that infanticide, if not actually suppressed, has decreased. A further cause for the disparity of the sexes is the large military population. Classified according to age, there were, under 15 years\u2014boys, 212,478; girls, 174,151: total children, 386,629, or 36.21 per cent. of the population. As regards religious distinctions, Hindus numbered 689,612; Muhammadans, 304,123; Sikhs, 68,442; Jains, 1307; Christians, 3773; and Parsis, 6. The percentages of each religion in the total population were as follows:\u2014Hindus, 64.61; Muhammadans, 28.49; Sikhs, 6.42; Christians and \u2018others,\u2019 0.47. The Muhammadans are sub-divided according to religion, into 299,056 Sunnis, 4664 Shi\u00e1s, and 9 Wah\u00e1b\u00eds. Among the various races of the District, the Jats rank first in number, with a total of 171,257, of whom 111,257 were Hindus, 47,279 Sikhs, and 12,429 Musalm\u00e1ns. In the northern pargan\u00e1s they form the chief proprietary body, and keep up their usual reputation for industry and frugality. The Cham\u00e1rs come next, with 140,751; namely, Hindus, 130,349; Sikhs, 10,398; and Muhammadans, 4. Pottery is the hereditary handicraft of this caste, but its members may be found in all menial positions, as the lowest social grade of the District. In Bengal and other parts of India, they are skinners and leather-workers. The R\u00e1jputs, once the leading landowning tribe, still possess many small estates, but are careless and unsystematic cultivators, generally poor and involved in debt. Out of a total of 92,833 members of this caste, 22,608 are returned as Hindus, 203 as Sikhs, and 69,222 as Muhammadans. The Br\u00e1hmans number 65,035, and follow their customary avocations as priests, agriculturists, shopkeepers, and domestic servants. By religion, 64,396 are returned as Hindus, 323 as Sikhs, and 316 as Muhammadans. The Gujars (51,077) are almost equally divided between Hinduism and Isl\u00e1m, 25,408 being returned as Hindus, 25,614 as Muhammadans, and 55 as Sikhs. As elsewhere, they are fonder of cattle-breeding than of agriculture, and show the ancestral tendency towards a wild, lawless life. The other leading tribes and castes are the following:\u2014Sain\u00ed, 63,054, namely, Hindus 61,346, Sikhs 988, and Muhammadans 720; Jh\u00ednwar, 47,104, namely, Hindus 44,030, Sikhs 1092, and Muhammadans 1982; Ch\u00fahra, 41,756, namely, Hindus 40,871, Sikhs 853, and Muhammadans 31; Baniy\u00e1, 40,069, namely, Hindus 39,034, Sikhs 83, Jains 952, but not a single Muhammadan; Arain, 30,881, namely, Hindus 336, and Muhammadans 30,545; Tarkh\u00e1n, 25,265, namely, Hindus 19,094, Sikhs 1561, and Muhammadans 4610; Jul\u00e1ha, 24,931, namely, Hindus 3300, Sikhs 117, and Muhammadans 21,514; Tell\u00ed, 17,577, namely, Hindus 117, and Muhammadans 17,400; Loh\u00e1r, 16,550, namely, Hindus\n9066, Sikhs 341, and Muhammadans 7143; Kumbhar, 15,598, namely, Hindus 12,808, Sikhs 161, and Muhammadans 2629; N\u00e1\u00ed, 14,932, namely, Hindus 10,609, Sikhs 352, and Muhammadans 3971; Kamboh, 12,988, namely, Hindus 10,106, Sikhs 1717, and Muhammadans 1165; Khattri, 8154, namely, Hindus 7668, Sikhs 481, and Muhammadans 5; Son\u00e1r, 7332, namely, Hindus 6648, Sikhs 102, and Muhammadans 573; Gad\u00e1ri\u00e1, 6671, all Hindus. The exclusively Muhammadan tribes consist of\u2014Sheikhs, 28,920; Path\u00e1ns, 9845; Sayyids, 8543; Penja, 6684; and Biluch\u00eds, 1070. The religious mendicant class is largely represented in Amb\u00e1la. Of 10,434 Fak\u00edrs, 9939 are returned as Muhammadans, 473 as Hindus, and 22 as Sikhs; while of 11,897 Jugts, 7758 are returned as Hindus, 4091 as Muhammadans, and 48 as Sikhs. Of the 3773 Christians, 3473 were Europeans or Americans, 74 Eurasians, and 224 natives. The Church of England numbered 2253 adherents, the Roman Catholics 896, Presbyterians 177, Wesleyans 5. The inhabitants of the Kotaha pargan\u00e1, in the hill country, are a simple quiet race, clinging almost without exception to the Hindu faith of their forefathers, deeply devoted to their homes, and seldom visiting the plains. Proprietary right is kept up amongst them with more than Indian tenacity; a family may be absent for a hundred years, yet their names will be held in remembrance, and their descendants may return at any time to reclaim their possessions without a remonstrance. The places of pilgrimage in the District are very numerous. Along the sacred S\u00e1rasw\u00e1t\u00ed (Sarsuti), the whole year round, there is a constant succession of festivals at one shrine or another; and religious fairs are held at many other towns scattered about the country. The attendance at these fairs has fallen off of late years, owing to the dislike of the people to the sanitary regulations rendered necessary by outbreaks of cholera. The total agricultural population amounted in 1881 to 530,266 persons. The Census of 1881 returned the 11 largest towns with their population as follows:\u2014Umballa City and Cantonment, 67,463; Jagadhri, 12,300; Sadhawra, 10,794; Rupar, 10,326; Shahabad, 10,218; Buriya, 7411; Thanesar, 6005; Kharar, 4265; Radaur, 4081; Ladwa, 4061; Pihewa, 3408. These figures show an urban population of 140,332 persons, or 13\u00b72 per cent. of the total population. Of the 2226 villages and towns in the District, 794 contain less than 200 inhabitants, 874 from 200 to 500, 379 from 500 to 1000, 130 from 1000 to 2000, 28 from 2000 to 3000, 14 from 3000 to 5000, 2 from 5000 to 10,000, 4 from 10,000 to 15,000, and 1 upwards of 50,000. As regards occupation, the Census classifies the adult male population over fifteen years of age into seven main groups as under: (1) Professional, including civil and military, and the learned professions, 30,502; (2) domestic and menial servants, 34,426; (3) commercial, including\nmerchants, traders, carriers, etc., 10,642; (4) agricultural and pastoral, 295,302; (5) industrial, including manufacturers, artisans, etc., 125,950; (6) indefinite and non-productive, including labourers, 23,291; (7) unspecified, 47,411.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The cultivated area of Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 District in 1881 amounted to 951,890 acres, leaving 692,959 acres uncultivated, of which 187,539 are returned as cultivable, 127,151 as grazing land, and 378,269 as uncultivable waste. The staple crops are wheat, barley, and gram for the spring harvest; with rice, jo\u00e1r, b\u00e1jra, Indian corn, moth, cotton, and sugar-cane for the autumn harvest. Poppy, tobacco, and hemp are also grown, but only for home consumption. The area under each crop in 1881 was returned as follows:\u2014Wheat, 354,045 acres; rice, 88,598; jo\u00e1r (great millet, Sorghum vulgare), 98,443; b\u00e1jra (spiked millet, Pencillaria spicata), 7341; kangni (Italian millet, Panicum italicum), 1013; mak\u00e1i (Indian corn, Zea mayz), 131,005; jau (barley), 59,793; chin\u00e1 (Panicum miliaceum), 12,440; gram (Cicer arietinum), 107,723; moth (Phaseolus aconitifolius), 18,423; matar (peas, Pisum sativum), 1456; m\u00e1sh (Phaseolus radiatus), 16,859; m\u00fang (Phaseolus mungo), 1528; mas\u00fari (Ervum lens), 23,110; poppy, 3680; tobacco, 6750; coriander seed, 162; chillies, 584; linseed, 3509; sarson (mustard, Sinapis dichotoma), 14,564; til (Sesamum orientale), 1001; t\u00e1r\u00e1mira (Sinapis eruca), 3422; cotton, 65,650; hemp, 1830; safflower, 12,012; indigo, 944; vegetables, 5543; sugar-cane, 37,097; other crops, 390 acres. Total, including twice-cropped land, 1,078,916. The quality of the crops is steadily improving, the higher cereals, tobacco, cotton, and sugar-cane being largely substituted for inferior food-grains, such as millets and pulses. This improvement is the result of an increase in material prosperity, enabling the peasantry to incur a larger outlay upon their farms. Manure is used to a slight extent in the neighbourhood of villages, and rotation of crops is so far understood that the same staple is seldom sown on a single plot for two years in succession; but the land is incessantly cultivated year after year, never lying fallow for more than six months at a time. The average out-turn of produce per acre is returned as follows:\u2014Rice, 400 lbs.; indigo (manufactured), 16 lbs.; cotton (raw), 218 lbs.; sugar (refined), 184 lbs.; opium, 16 lbs.; tobacco, 610 lbs.; wheat, 706 lbs.; inferior grains, 424 lbs.; oil-seeds, 265 lbs.; fibres, 117 lbs. Irrigation is practised on 173,499 acres, 22,463 acres being watered by Government works, and 151,936 acres by private individuals. The Western Jumna Canal supplies part of the District with water, while the remainder is irrigated from wells worked with a Persian wheel or a hand-lever. Near the hills water lies so close to the surface that it may be obtained in the river beds by scratching away a little of the earth; in the upland plain, however, at a distance\nfrom the mountains, many villages do not possess a well, even for drinking purposes, but depend entirely for water supply on the surface drainage collected in tanks. Where irrigation is not available, no spring crop can be grown.\n\nThe condition of the people is generally comfortable, and they are seldom in debt to any great extent; but near the larger towns the peasantry have become ambitious of a better style of living, which often induces them to exceed their means, especially in the matter of dress and personal ornament. The total capital necessary for a small holding of, say 10 acres of land, is about \u00a311, namely \u00a310 for the price of a pair of average plough bullocks, and \u00a31 for the necessary implements. For a similar-sized holding of irrigated land, about double the above capital is necessary for two pairs of bullocks and the well-fittings. The latter, in this part of the country, are extremely inexpensive, consisting merely of a rope running over a wheel, and an earthenware or leather bucket. The agricultural stock of the District in 1878\u201379 was returned as follows:\u2014Cows and bullocks, 349,270; horses, 8600; ponies, 3035; donkeys, 11,767; sheep and goats, 131,492; pigs, 8896; camels, 112; carts, 10,205; ploughs, 90,816; boats, 62. Of the total area of 2570 square miles, 1068 square miles are assessed for Government revenue. Of these, 624 square miles are returned as cultivated, and 202 as cultivable. Total Government assessment, including rates and cesses on land, \u00a390,857. Estimated actual rent paid by cultivators, \u00a3274,892. All the villages, except quite an insignificant number, are in the hands of cultivating communities. The j\u00e1gird\u00e1rs, or persons holding assignments of revenue for particular estates, are naturally very numerous, owing to the historical origin of their tenure. They include the families of all the chiefs whose powers were reduced in 1849, and in most cases they are Sikhs by religion. Another peculiar tenure of the District is that known as chah\u00e1ram, which took its rise from a common custom of the cis-Sutlej Sikhs, when struggling with the native proprietors for the possession of a particular village, to compromise the matter by assigning half the revenue to each of the contending parties. Most of the tenants have rights of occupancy. Rents ruled as follows in 1880\u201381, according to the quality of the soil, its irrigable capabilities, and the nature of the crop grown:\u2014Rice, from 6s. 1\u00bdd. to 11s. 10\u00bdd. per acre; wheat, from 5s. 1\u00bdd. to 19s. 7\u00bdd. per acre; inferior food-grains, from 4s. to 12s. per acre; oil-seeds, from 4s. 4\u00bdd. to 10s. 10\u00bdd. per acre; cotton, from 9s. to 15s. 3d. per acre; other fibres, from 3s. 4\u00bdd. to 12s. per acre; indigo, from 4s. 1\u00bdd. to 8s. 6d. per acre; sugar, from 14s. 7\u00bdd. to \u00a31, 9s. od. per acre; opium, from 15s. 7\u00bdd. to \u00a31, 7s. per acre; tobacco, from 12s. to \u00a31, 2s. 6d. an acre. Wages in kind remain stationary, but money wages and prices have doubled within the last\nfew years. In 1881, agricultural and unskilled labourers received from 3d. to 4\u00bdd. per diem; while artisans obtained from 7\u00bdd. to 10\u00bdd. per diem. Bullock carts hire at the rate of 1s. 9d., and camels at 1s. 3d. per day. The following were the prices of food-grains and the principal crops in January 1881, per cwt:\u2014Wheat (best), 6s. 7d.; flour (best), 7s. 6d.; barley, 4s. 4d.; gram, 5s. 3d.; Indian corn, 4s. 10d.; jo\u00e1r, 4s. 6d.; b\u00e1jra, 5s. 4d.; rice (best), 16s.; d\u00e1l, 5s. 11d.; potatoes, 7s.; cotton (cleaned), \u00a32; sugar (best), \u00a32, 9s. 10d.; tobacco, 14s.; and salt, 10s. 2d. per cwt.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Amb\u00e1la suffers, like the neighbouring Districts, from the effects of drought. In 1860\u201361 it shared the famine which desolated the surrounding country. The autumn rains of 1860 failed utterly, and the rain crop withered in the ground. So great was the heat that even the jungle tracts produced no grass, and the cattle died off by thousands. A sprinkling of rain fell in December, but did not prove sufficient for the spring sowings; and the rabi crops also failed completely, except where means existed for artificial irrigation. Wheat rose to 8 sers per rupee (14s. per cwt.), and the mortality from disease and hunger began to be serious. Refugees from Bikaner and Hari\u00e1na flocked into the District, as usual on such occasions, and augmented the local distress. The dearth continued to be felt throughout the summer, until the ripening of the autumn harvest, which fortunately turned out to be exceptionally good. The year 1869\u201370 was elsewhere one of famine, but the distress did not reach Amb\u00e1la, where a moderate harvest was gathered in. Relief was necessarily provided for the starving poor from Bikaner, Hiss\u00e1r, and Sirsa, but charity was not required by the inhabitants of the District themselves. Local subscriptions sufficed for all demands.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014Amb\u00e1la being mainly an agricultural District, has little trade or manufactures deserving special notice. Small articles of iron-work are made at R\u00fapar, carpets at Amb\u00e1la, and coarse country cloth in every village. The principal centres of trade are Amb\u00e1la, R\u00fapar, Jag\u00e1dhri, Kh\u00edzr\u00e1b\u00e1d, B\u00faria, and Khar\u00e1r. The Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway traverses the District for a length of 42 miles, entering it by a bridge across the Jumna, a few miles south of Jag\u00e1dhri, and leaving it by another across the Ghaggar, 6 miles west of Amb\u00e1la city. There are stations at the city and cantonments, at Bar\u00e1ra, and at Jag\u00e1dhri. The Grand Trunk Road enters Amb\u00e1la District from Karn\u00e1l, a few miles east of Thanesar, whence it runs nearly north as far as Amb\u00e1la, where it turns north-west, and passes into Pati\u00e1la territory, after a course of 38 miles in the District. The Amb\u00e1la and K\u00e1lka road (for Simla) leaves the Grand Trunk Road a few miles above the Amb\u00e1la cantonment, and runs nearly north for 38 miles to K\u00e1lka, at the foot of the hills. This road is metalled through-\nout, and crosses the Ghaggar by a ford about midway. A detention of a few hours sometimes occurs at the crossing after heavy rain in the hills. The Saharanpur road runs from Ambala south-east via Mulana and Jagadhri for 39 miles. There are also several minor lines of unmetalled road connecting the towns and principal villages. Total length of metalled roads, 191 miles; unmetalled roads, 468 miles. Lines of telegraph run by the side of the Grand Trunk Road and the railway. A project for a railway line from Ambala to Kalka at the foot of the hills in order to further facilitate communication with Simla has been for some time under consideration. The line has been surveyed, estimates have been drawn up, and the undertaking only awaits official sanction to be carried out.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The administrative staff ordinarily includes a Deputy Commissioner, 3 Assistant and 2 Extra-Assistant Commissioners, besides the usual medical, fiscal, and constabulary officials. In 1872-73, the revenue of the District from all sources amounted to \u00a3102,024, of which sum \u00a374,827, or nearly three-fourths, was derived from the land-tax. In 1880-81, the revenue amounted to \u00a3111,070, of which \u00a378,262 was derived from the land. The other principal items are stamps and local rates. The imperial police in 1880 numbered 913 officers and men, who were supplemented by the following special bodies:\u2014Municipal police, 102; cantonment police, 123; and ferry police, 11. The total machinery, therefore, for the protection of person and property amounted to 1149 officers and men, being at the rate of 1 policeman to every 2'23 square miles and to every 929 of the population. The District contains 2 prisons, one at Ambala, the other at Rupar. The former is the local jail, and its inmates are the criminals of the District. In 1880 it had a total of 2344 prisoners, and a daily average of 615, of whom 13 were females. The Rupar jail is a depot or central prison, to which convicts are brought from other Districts to be employed upon the canal works. It contained in 1880 a total of 3552 prisoners, and a daily average of 2066, all males. The number of schools maintained or assisted by the State numbered 98 in 1880, and were attended by 5262 pupils. The number of private and unaided schools is large; there are at least 293 indigenous schools attended by 3401 pupils. The Census of 1881 returned a total of 6201 boys under instruction; 26,790 males as able to read and write, but not under instruction, and 555,281 as unable to read and write. Of the female population, only 164 girls are returned as under instruction, and 604 others as able to read and write. Ambala also contains an Institution for Government Wards, who in this District are necessarily numerous, owing to the large number of jagirdar families. It is hoped that great good has already been effected by thus bringing the sons of influential Sikh gentlemen into constant contact with European\nopinion. For fiscal and administrative purposes, Amb\u00e1la is divided into 6 tahsils and 15 pargan\u00e1s, with a total of 2226 villages, owned by 100,809 proprietors or coparceners; average land revenue, including local rates and cesses, from each proprietor, a little less than \u00a31. The District includes one second-class municipality, Amb\u00e1la, besides 10 of the third-class, namely, Jag\u00e1dhri, S\u00e1dhaura, R\u00fapar, B\u00fariy\u00e1, Thanesar, Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, Khar\u00e1r, Pihewa, Radaur, and L\u00e1dwa. In 1880-81 their aggregate municipal revenue amounted to \u00a37537, and their expenditure to \u00a36464; population within municipal limits, 99,646.\n\nSanitary Aspects.\u2014The average yearly rainfall is about 36 inches. In 1880 the rainfall amounted to 40.3 inches, of which 5.3 inches fell from January to May; 34.4 inches from June to September; and 0.6 inch from October to December. Fever is the most prevalent disease of the District; but bowel complaints carry off a large number of persons annually, and small-pox occasionally appears in a violent epidemic form. Goitre and cretinism are extremely common on the banks of the Ghaggar, where diseases of the spleen also affect a very great proportion of the inhabitants. The villages along its course are exceedingly unhealthy and much under-populated. Blindness prevails in Amb\u00e1la to a greater extent than in any other part of the Punjab. The average of blind persons in the District is 1 in every 126 inhabitants, as compared with 1 in 1037 in England. The total number of registered deaths from all causes in 1880 was 30,423, or an average of 30 per thousand of the population. No less than 22,069 deaths, or 21.87 per thousand of the population, were due to fevers. The District contains a civil hospital at Amb\u00e1la city, and second-class dispensaries at R\u00fapar, Jag\u00e1dhri, Thanesar, and S\u00e1dhaura, which afforded relief in 1880 to 79,948 patients. There is also a leper asylum at Amb\u00e1la town. In addition to the medical aid afforded by the established dispensaries, 3 hakims or itinerant native doctors are maintained by Government, and travel over the District.

S. Melvill, Esq., C.S., 1855; and the Report on the Revised Settlement of the Southern Pargan\u00e1s of Amb\u00e1la District, by W. Wynyard, Esq., C.S., 1853. The District is at present passing through a revision of the Settlement, 1883.]\n\nAmb\u00e1la.\u2014Tahsil or Sub-division of Amb\u00e1la District, Punjab. Area, 366 square miles; population in 1881, 220,477; namely, 132,124 Hindus, 12,167 Jains, 72,007 Muhammadans, and 4194 Christians and 'others'; average density of population, 602 per square mile.\n\nAmb\u00e1la.\u2014City and cantonment of Amb\u00e1la District, Punjab, and civil head-quarters of the District, situated on an open plain 1040 feet above\nsea level, and 3 miles east of the river Ghaggar. Lat. $30^\\circ 21' 25''$ N.; long. $76^\\circ 52' 14''$ E. The town was founded probably in the 14th century by an Amba Rajput, from whom it derives its name, but was a place of little importance prior to the British occupation of the Province. In 1809, when the cis-Sutlej States came under British protection, the estate of Ambala was held by Daya Kaur, widow of Sardar Gurbaksh Singh, its Sikh possessor. Daya Kaur was temporarily ejected by Ranjit Singh, but was restored by General Ochterlony. On Daya Kaur's death, which occurred in 1823, the little principality lapsed to the British Government, and Ambala town was fixed on as the residence of the Political Agent for the cis-Sutlej States. In 1843, a cantonment was established a few miles south of the town. In 1849, the Punjab came under British rule, and Ambala was made the head-quarters of a District. The town is unwalled, and consists of two portions, a new and an old quarter. In the old part of the town the thoroughfares are narrow, dark, and tortuous, so as to scarcely permit of the passage of a single elephant; but the newer portion, which has sprung up in the direction of the cantonment, consists of fine open roads, well laid out. Indeed, the long straight military roads of the cantonment give a certain monotony to the European quarter which strikes a stranger as wearisome and unpleasant. In March 1869, a grand Darbar was held at Ambala, on the occasion of the visit of the late Amir of Afghanistan, Sher Ali.\n\nThe water supply of the town was up till lately very insufficient; but recent public works and municipal improvements have to a great extent remedied this evil. The cantonment lies four miles southeast of the city, and covers an area of 7220 acres. The ordinary garrison comprises 3 batteries of artillery, 1 regiment of European and 1 of native cavalry, besides 1 regiment each of European and native infantry. The central portion of the cantonment is laid out with good broad metalled roads, shaded in many instances by lines of fine old pipal trees. The church is considered the handsomest in the Punjab. There are also a club-house, several hotels, and a staging bungalow. The Civil Station lies between the city and cantonment, and contains the usual District offices\u2014a court-house and treasury, jail, hospital, American mission school, and Government Wards Institution. Ambala is well situated for commercial purposes, midway between the Jumna and the Sutlej rivers, at the point where the Punjab and Delhi Railway intersects the Grand Trunk Road. Its importance is enhanced by the fact that it is at present the nearest station on the railway to the summer seat of the Government of India at Simla; and a branch line to Kalaka at the foot of the hills, 39 miles in length, is about to be undertaken. Owing to this circumstance, Ambala contains a large number of English shops; and a brisk trade in European commodities\nis carried on. The city is a great grain mart for the produce of the District and of the Independent States to the West. It also carries on a considerable trade in hill products, ginger, and turmeric. Chief exports\u2014cotton goods, grain, and carpets; imports\u2014English cloth and iron, salt, wool, and silk.\n\nThe population of the town and cantonment, which in 1868 numbered 50,696, had increased in February 1881 to 67,463, made up as follows: \u2014 Hindus, 34,522; Muhammadans, 27,115; Sikhs, 1867; Jains, 410; Christians and \u2018others,\u2019 3549. Amb\u00e1la city and civil station, with a separate population of 26,777, has been constituted a second-class municipality; revenue in 1880-81, \u00a32253; expenditure, \u00a31992.\n\nAmb\u00e1l\u00e1pulai.\u2014T\u00e1luk in Travancore State, Madras Presidency. Area, 121 square miles; population (1881) 93,104.\n\nAmb\u00e1peta.\u2014Estate in God\u00e1vari District, Madras Presidency. Quit-rent or peshkash, \u00a31614.\n\nAmbarn\u00e1th.\u2014Village and temple in Th\u00e1na District, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See AMARNATH.\n\nAmb\u00e1sam\u00fadram.\u2014T\u00e1luk in Tinnevell\u00ed District, Madras Presidency; contains 92 towns and villages. Area, 569 square miles, or 364,160 acres, of which 9026 acres are zamind\u00e1ri, 7943 in\u00e1m, and the rest Government land. Of the area of Government land, 63,685 acres are under cultivation, and 62,912 fallow. Land revenue, \u00a338,147. The Tambr\u00e1parni river flows through the t\u00e1luk, joined, about four or five miles before its debouchure from the mountain range, by the Servi\u00e1r in five falls, at a famous spot, known as Papanassam, where many thousand pilgrims annually congregate. The t\u00e1luk contains 50 Siva temples, whose annual income in cash amounts to \u00a31647, and endowments in land and jewels to \u00a35744. There are two zamind\u00e1ris, Singampatti and Urk\u00e1d, in the t\u00e1luk. Population (1881) 165,152, namely 78,882 males and 86,270 females; density, 290 persons per square mile; number of occupied houses, 36,881. (See TINNEVELLI.)\n\nAmb\u00e1sam\u00fadram.\u2014Town and head-quarters of the Amb\u00e1sam\u00fadram t\u00e1luk, Tinnevell\u00ed District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 8\u00b0 42' 45\" N., long. 77\u00b0 29' 15\" E. Population (1881) 8770, namely 8383 Hindus, 313 Muhammadans, and 54 Christians. Head-quarters of Sub-divisional officer.\n\nAmbatm\u00fari.\u2014Pass in the Uppinangadi t\u00e1luk, South K\u00e1nara District, Madras Presidency; between 13\u00b0 0' 45\" and 13\u00b0 4' N. lat., and between 75\u00b0 29' 15\" and 75\u00b0 33' 45\" E. long. It leads into Mysore, but is little used.\n\nAmbela (Umbeyla).\u2014Mountain pass situated just beyond British territory, north-east of Pesh\u00e1war District, Punjab. The pass has acquired importance, as being the route selected on various occasions when\npunitive military expeditions have been rendered necessary against the predatory mountain clans along the border. The last and most important of these was in 1863. A colony of Wah\u00e1bi Muhammadans, established at Sit\u00e1na in the Sw\u00e1t country, and made up of religious fanatics, escaped criminals, mutinous soldiers, and political refugees from British India, had been a source of trouble and anxiety to the Punj\u00e1b Government since the annexation of the Province. This fanatical colony, throughout the whole period between 1850 and 1863, had kept the border tribes in a state of chronic hostility to British rule. They themselves, however, wisely avoided direct collision with the British authorities, till in 1857 they boldly made a plundering inroad into our territory, and attacked the camp of a British officer. Accordingly, in 1858, a force 5000 strong was marched into the hill country through the Ambela Pass. After some difficulties, the column destroyed the villages of the tribes who had rendered assistance to the Wah\u00e1bi fanatics, razed or blew up two forts, and destroyed the traitor settlement at Sit\u00e1na. Engagements were entered into with the border tribes that they would prevent the fanatics from re-entering their territory, and the Sit\u00e1na lands were made over to one of these tribes. Scarcely two years elapsed, however, before the rebel colony had regained their influence over the wild highland clans, and recommenced their inroads on to British territory, the tribes either rendering them active assistance, or allowing them free passage through their territory. These frontier inroads culminated in an attack in September 1863 upon the camp of our Guide Corps, and in a declaration of a Holy War (jih\u00e1d) by the fanatics against the English infidels. A strong military force was organised in the Punj\u00e1b, to put a stop once and for all to these maraudings; and on the 18th October 1863 a British army of 7000 men under General Sir Neville Chamberlain marched out of cantonments, and the following evening entered the Ambela defile. The hill tribes all threw in their fortunes with the rebel fanatics, and on the 20th the British force was brought to a halt before it cleared the pass, and reinforcements were summoned. The coalition of tribes, at one time numbering 60,000 men, kept up a constant series of harassing attacks on the British position, capturing some pickets and inflicting heavy loss. The force was kept acting entirely on the defensive till December, when the further reinforcements raised the strength of the column to 9000 regular troops. Meanwhile diplomatic efforts were being made to break up the coalition, and some of the chiefs withdrew, while others were wavering. On the night of the 15th December, a successful night attack was made on the enemy\u2019s position, and on the 16th the village of Ambela was captured and burned. The coalition thereupon dissolved, and the Bunair tribes, on whom the rebel settlement mainly depended, entered into an engagement with us to\nburn the fanatics in their stronghold. In less than a week, a strong British brigade, reinforced by the Bunairs, advanced through the mountains to the fanatical settlement, and reduced it to ashes. The force returned to the Ambela Pass on the 23rd December, and on the 25th re-entered British territory, not a shot being fired on its homeward march. The British loss during the campaign amounted to no less than 227 killed (British and native) and 620 wounded. The total loss of the enemy was reported at 3000 killed and wounded.\n\n**Amber (Amer).**\u2014The ancient but now decayed capital of Jaipur (Jeypore) State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, about 5 miles north-east of the present capital, Jaipur Town. Lat. $26\u00b0 58' 45''$ N., long. $75\u00b0 52' 50''$ E.; population (1881) 5036, namely 4346 Hindus, 665 Muhammadans, and 25 'others.' Its picturesque situation, almost entirely surrounded by hills, and at the mouth of a rocky mountain gorge, in which nestles a little lake, has attracted the admiration of travellers. The margin of the lake is dotted over with beautiful buildings, and the hill slopes which surround it are clothed in the rains with green foliage. Jacquemont and Heber have both recorded the deep impression made by the beauty of the scene. Amber is reached from Jaipur by a good road, suitable for horse-carriages; but the ascent to the palace, and the exploration of the site of the ancient city, must still be done on elephant or pony-back (1883). A day thus spent at Amber is usually one of the most enjoyable which falls to the lot of the traveller in India. The name of Amber occurs in Ptolemy, but nothing is known in regard to its early history. In A.D. 1037, the Kachhw\u00e1ha R\u00e1jputs, shortly after obtaining a footing in this part of the country, conquered Amber from the King of the Sus\u00e1wat Min\u00e1s after a protracted struggle. The seat of R\u00e1jput power was thereupon transferred to Amber, which became the capital of the country, and gave the name to the state. There are many objects of interest at Amber. The old palace ranks second only to Gwalior as a specimen of R\u00e1jput architecture. Commenced about 1600 A.D., a century later than the Gwalior palace, by R\u00e1j\u00e1 M\u00e1n Singh, who erected the Observatory at Benares, it was completed early in the 18th century by Siw\u00e1i Jai Singh, who added the beautiful gateway which bears his name, before transferring his capital to Jaipur city in 1728. It lacks the fresh and vigorous stamp of Hindu originality, which characterises the earlier buildings at Gwalior, and instead of standing on a lofty pedestal of rock, it lies low. But nothing could be more picturesque than the way in which it grows, as it were, out of its rocky base, and reflects its architectural beauties on the water. The interior arrangements are excellent, and the suites of rooms form vistas opening upon striking views of the lake. The ornamentation and technical details are free from the feebleness which had already begun to paralyze Hindu architecture; and they\nbear the impress of the influence which Akbar managed to stamp on everything done during his reign. Amber contains many large and handsome temples, and was at one time much frequented by ascetics and religious devotees from all parts of India. A small temple, where a goat is every morning offered up to K\u00e1l\u00ed, preserves the tradition of a daily human sacrifice on the same spot, in the pre-historic times anterior to R\u00e1jput ascendancy. Few of the temples, however, are now maintained, and the glory of Amber has departed. The palace, although still kept in good order, and occasionally visited by the Chief, is generally silent and deserted. The fort which crowns the summit of a hill, 400 or 500 feet above, is connected with and defended the palace. It has been from time immemorial the State treasury and prison, and remains so to the present day; the Kachhw\u00e1ha R\u00e1jputs having engaged, on wresting the fort from the M\u00edn\u00e1s, to maintain the treasury here for ever. Mr. Fergusson, from whose work some of the foregoing sentences have been condensed, has given an excellent description of Amber in his History of Eastern Architecture, p. 480, ed. 1867.\n\nAmbg\u00e1on.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Ch\u00e1nda District, Central Provinces. Lat. 20\u00b0 38' 30\" N., long. 79\u00b0 59' 45\" E.; area, with its dependent zam\u00ednd\u00e1r\u00eds (excluding Ah\u00edr\u00ed), 1212 square miles. It contains 67 villages and 4 zam\u00ednd\u00e1r\u00eds. Hilly, and, except near the Waingang\u00e1 river, covered with jungle; much intersected by tributaries of the Waingang\u00e1. Chief productions, rice, tas\u00e1r silk, and jungle products, with large import trade in salt from the east coast. Telugu is spoken in the south, Mar\u00e1th\u00ed in the north. The local traders of the pargan\u00e1 are Telingas. Principal place of interest, Markandi; largest villages, Garhchiroli and Ch\u00e1murs\u00ed. The village of Ambg\u00e1on contains a population of only 483 souls.\n\nAmbika.\u2014River in Surat District, Bombay Presidency. Rises in the B\u00e1nsda hills, and after flowing through Baroda territory, westward, in two separate channels, enters Surat District, through which it flows in a winding course over a deep bed of sand between the Chikhli and Jal\u00e1lpur Sub-divisions, falling into the sea 15 miles south of the Purna. The town of Gandevi, about 12 miles from the mouth, is the limit of the rise of the tide. At a point about 6 miles from the sea, the railway crosses the Ambika by a bridge 875 feet long and raised 28 feet above the level of the river. The Ambika is joined by two considerable streams, the K\u00e1veri and Kharer\u00e1, and, below the junction, widens out into a broad estuary. About a mile and a half from the entrance is a bar, covered at low water to a depth of three or four feet, with a tidal rise of 22 feet. Vessels of considerable size can pass up for about 6 miles as far as to Bilimora; beyond this, for five miles, only boats of 50 tons and under can proceed. The K\u00e1veri and Kharer\u00e1 are both crossed by railway bridges, 688 feet and 625 feet in length.\nAmb\u00falup\u00e1li.\u2014Town in the Amb\u00falup\u00e1li t\u00e1luk of Travancore State, Madras Presidency. Lat. 9\u00b0 23' N., long. 76\u00b0 24' 30\" E.; population about 3000. A canal connects it with Alleppi, and a great annual festival, held here in April, attracts some local trade. Headquarters of the t\u00e1luk; magistrate's and munsif's courts. Famous in history as the scene of Fra Paolo Bartolomeo's protest against the compulsory attendance of Christians at Hindu festivals. Until 1754 it was the capital of the Chembagach\u00e1ri R\u00e1j\u00e1s.\n\nAmb\u00far (Amb\u00fardr\u00fag, Petamb\u00far).\u2014Town in the Vellore t\u00e1luk, North Arcot District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 12\u00b0 50' 25\" N., long. 78\u00b0 44' 30\" E.; population (1881) 10,390, namely, 5991 Hindus, 4388 Muhammadans, and 11 Christians. A well-built and compact town, about 30 miles from Vellore, 79 miles from Bangalore, and 112 miles (by rail) from Madras, situated at the foot of the Kadapan\u00e1tham Pass, which leads from the Eastern Hills of the B\u00e1r\u00e1mahal; it lies on the south bank of the P\u00e1l\u00e1r river. The railway station is within half a mile of the town, and an excellent road connects it with Vellore and Salem. The Amb\u00far Dr\u00fag peak towers above the town. It possesses a considerable trade in oils, gh\u00ed, and indigo, which the Labbay merchants (Nagar Muhammadans) collect here for export to Madras both above and below the gh\u00e1t, but since the opening of the railway in 1860 Amb\u00far has lost its monopoly of the gh\u00e1t carrying trade. The fort, situated on the almost inaccessible Amb\u00far Dr\u00fag, and commanding an important pass into the Carnatic, was in past times keenly contested. In 1750, the first pitched battle in the great wars of the Carnatic was fought under its walls, in which Anwar-ud-d\u00edn, the Naw\u00e1b of Arcot, was defeated by Muzaffar Jang. This battle is remarkable as being the first occasion in which European troops played a conspicuous part in Indian warfare. In 1768, the fort was gallantly defended by the 10th regiment of Madras Infantry. Twenty years later it was besieged by Haidar Al\u00ed, and taken; only, however, to be restored by the Treaty of Mangalore. In the expeditions against Mysore, in 1792 and 1799, this fortress was occupied as a point of great importance on the line of communications.\n\nAmb\u00farp\u00e9t.\u2014Town in Salem District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 12\u00b0 47' 15\" N., long. 78\u00b0 45' 15\" E.; houses, 1411; population (1881) 6700. A suburb of Vaniyamb\u00e1di.\n\nAmer.\u2014Town in Jaipur State.\u2014See Amber.\n\nAmet.\u2014Town in the Native State of Udaipur (Oodeypore), R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Situated in a fine valley, nearly surrounded by hills, on the banks of the Chandrabh\u00e1g\u00e1, a tributary of the Ban\u00e1s. One of the first-class nobles of the State, owning 51 villages, resides here. The town is walled.\n\nAmethi.\u2014Village in Farukh\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces, situated on the right bank of the Ganges, about a mile east of Farukh-\n\u00e1b\u00e1d town, of which it forms a suburb. A small income is derived from a house tax under the provisions of Act xx. of 1856, for police and conservancy purposes. Beneath the village, the Ghatiagh\u00e1t boat-bridge conveys the Rohilkhand Trunk Road across the Ganges.\n\n**Amethi.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 of Sult\u00e1npur District, Oudh. Bounded on the north by Isauli and Sult\u00e1npur pargan\u00e1s, on the east by Tappa Asl, on the south by Part\u00e1bgarh District, and on the west by Rokha J\u00e1s pargan\u00e1. Amethi is an important pargan\u00e1, occupied by a clan of Kshattriyas, known as the Bandhalgot\u00eds. Of the 365 villages comprising the pargan\u00e1, all but one are owned by this clan. R\u00e1j\u00e1 Madhu Singh\u2019s estate consists of 318 villages, covering an area of 265 square miles, and paying a Government land revenue of \u00a320,103. The Bandhalgot\u00ed clan is confined to Amethi, and does not possess a single village outside the pargan\u00e1. The members are alleged to be descended from a female bamboo-splitter who married a servant of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Hasanpur. It is alleged that they still, on certain ceremonial occasions, make religious offerings to a specimen of the ancestral implement\u2014the b\u00e1nska or knife used in splitting the bamboo. The Bandhalgot\u00eds themselves, however, repudiate this humble origin. According to their own account they are Surjabans\u00ed Kshattriyas, belonging to the branch of the clan now represented by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Jaipur, and descended from a scion of that house, who 900 years ago, when on a pilgrimage to Ajodhya, was led to settle here through a vision, by which it was disclosed to him that he and his successors were to become the hereditary lords of this part of the country. Area of the pargan\u00e1, 299 square miles, of which 131 are cultivated; population (1881), Hindus, 151,104; Muhammadans, 8514: total, 159,618. Average density of population, 523 per square mile.\n\n**Amethi Dungar.**\u2014Town in Lucknow District, Oudh; 17 miles from Lucknow, on the road to Sult\u00e1npur. Lat. 26\u00b0 45' 20\" N.; long. 81\u00b0 12' E. An ancient town, supposed to be of Bhar origin. It has repeatedly changed hands between the Hindus and Musalm\u00e1ns, and the inhabitants belong to these religions in about equal proportions. Population (1881) 5654, namely, Hindus 2739, and Muhammadans 2922; number of houses, 1151; area of town site, 110 acres. Seat of flourishing weaving trade; thriving export trade in hides and horns; Government school. A small revenue for police and conservancy purposes is raised under the provisions of Act xx. of 1856.\n\n**Amg\u00e1on.**\u2014Estate or zamind\u00e1r\u00ed in the eastern portion of Bhand\u00e1ra District, Central Provinces; area, 144 square miles, of which 47 are returned as under cultivation; villages, 61; occupied houses, 5577; population (1881) 27,524; namely, 13,625 males and 13,899 females. Amg\u00e1on village has a large weekly market. Near it extends some miles of low rocky jungle, infested with leopards, and the estate\ngenerally is noted for the number of man-eating tigers which have been killed from time to time.\n\n**Amgaon.**\u2014Village in Narsinghpur tahsil, Narsinghpur District, Central Provinces. Population (1881) 2492\u2014namely, Hindus, 2108; Kabirpanthis, 18; Muhammadans, 177; Jains, 6; aboriginal tribes, 183.\n\n**Amherst.**\u2014District in Tenasserim Division, British Burma, lying between 14\u00b0 59' and 17\u00b0 71' N. lat., and between 97\u00b0 30' and 98\u00b0 53' E. long.; area, 15,189 square miles; population in 1881, 301,086. Bounded on the north by the Salwin (Salween) and Kyun-eik rivers; on the east by the Thaung-yin river, and by the mountains which form the boundary between British and Burmese territories; on the south by the Malwe, a spur of the same range; and on the west by the Bilin (Bhfleng) river and the Gulf of Martaban. The administrative head-quarters of the District and Division are at Maulmain.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014Amherst District occupies the Thatun plain, lying between the Bilin (Bhfleng) and the Salwin (Salween) rivers, and the country lying north, south, and east of the mouths of the Salwin, Gyaing, and Attaran. Round Maulmain are alluvial plains watered by these rivers; shut in by the Dawna Hills, and south of Maulmain by the Taung-nyo chain, running parallel to the coast. In the extreme east is a narrow and densely-wooded region, broken by the Dawna range and its spurs; to the south is the valley of the Ve, situated between the Taung-nyo Hills and the sea, drained by numerous streams, with a general direction to the west. Tha-tun, or the country between the rivers Salwin (Salween) and Bilin (Bhfleng), has one main chain running northwards; Bilugyun, an island one mile west of Maulmain, and a township of Amherst District, is also traversed by a ridge of hills from north to south. The chief mountains in the District are the Dawna, starting from the Mula-yit Hill, an immense mass of rock, 5500 feet high, in 16\u00b0 5' 45\" N. lat., and 98\u00b0 42' 3\" E. long. They throw out numerous spurs, and run north-west for 200 miles, dividing the waters of the Haung-tharaw and Hlaing-bhwai from those of the Thaung-yin. This range presents in most parts the appearance of a wooded plateau of laterite cut up by drainage into hills. At places, the underlying rocks project into the bed of the Thaung-yin, and indicate volcanic agency. The main range and its offshoots form the watershed between the Bay of Bengal and the Gulf of Siam. The hills to the west of the main range undulate for some distance gently to the southward, but end in barren limestone ridges. From the Tsadaik Hill, in 15\u00b0 17' 25\" N. lat., and 95\u00b0 15' E. long., the Taung-nyo chain extends north-west to Maulmain, forming the Attaran watershed, and finally disappears in a small island at the mouth of the Gyaing. North of Maulmain and east of this river is a short range of limestone rocks (16 miles long), called Zwet-ka-beng. The main chain terminates at Kama-thaing, a little to\nthe south of Ky\u00fan-eik, the northern boundary of the District. There are two passes across these hills; the northern one a cart track from Kyauk-sari; the southern one a metalled road from Zemath-weh to Tha-t\u00fan. Large quantities of paddy are annually brought by the latter route to Maulmain by the rivers Binlaing (Benglaing) and Salw\u00edn. Several passes over the Dawna range connect the District with Siamese territory. The most important leads from Myawadi, an old and once fortified town on the Thaung-y\u00edn, to Rahaing, 45 miles east; and in the south-west monsoon, boats go down the Meinam from this town to Bangkok in eight days. The journey from Maulmain to Bangkok, by the famous pass of the Three Pagodas, occupies on an average 25 days. The route is by boat up the Attaran as far as Kann\u00ed (Kanee), and thence by elephants across the watershed.\n\nThe Salw\u00edn, Gyaing, Attaran, Thaung-y\u00edn, Bil\u00edn (Bhileng), are the chief rivers of the District. (1) The Salw\u00edn rises in Chinese territory, and after a tortuous course falls into the sea at Maulmain, where it is joined by the rivers Gyaing and Attaran. Its channel is broad, shallow, and obstructed by shoals, rendering it unnavigable by sea-going vessels, except at its southern mouth. Just below Martaban, the Salw\u00edn is divided into two branches, by Bil\u00fa (Bheeloo) island. The southern, the entrance for ships, is seven miles wide at its mouth; the northern branch is still broader, but is dangerous and altogether impracticable for shipping. Its chief tributaries are the Yonzalin, a river of the Salw\u00edn Hill Tracts; and the Binlaing. (2) The Gyaing, formed by the junction of the Hlaing-bhwai and the Haung-tharaw, flows almost due west till it falls into the Salw\u00edn at Maulmain town. It is choked by islands and sandbanks, but is navigated by native boats all the year round. The Haung-tharaw valley consists of several plateaux, separated by abrupt descents. (3) The Attaran river is formed by the junction of the Zam\u00ed (Zamee) and Winraw, two small streams which unite a few miles above the site of old Attaran. The river then takes the name of the Attaran, and flows north-westward, draining the country between the Taung-nyo chain and the low undulating hills west of the Dawna range, till it joins the Salw\u00edn on its south bank at Maulmain. It is a narrow, deep, and sluggish stream flowing for part of its course between high banks, shut in by dense overhanging foliage. (4) The Thaung-y\u00edn rises in the Dawna Hills, and forms the north-eastern boundary of the District; after a north-west course of 197 miles, it joins the Salw\u00edn. Its breadth varies from 100 to 1000 feet, but numerous rapids render it unnavigable. The remaining streams are of little importance. Off the coast, a little south of 16\u00b0 N. lat., is Double Island, with a lighthouse showing a first-order dioptric fixed light, with a catadioptric mirror, visible 19 miles.\n\nThe teak forests of Amherst District are extensive. Those on the\nDawna Hills rank among the most important in British Burma. For conservancy purposes they are divided into five tracts\u2014viz., the D\u00fcntham\u00ed (Doonthamee), Hlaing-bhwai, Thaung-y\u00edn, Haung-tharaw, and Attaran. (1) The D\u00fcntham\u00ed forests, between the rivers D\u00fcntham\u00ed and Salw\u00edn, cover 60 square miles, and in 1859 contained 14,340 first-class trees growing on dry ground. Excellent 'crooks' for ship-building are obtained, and the rivers afford the means of transit. (2) The Hlaing-bhwai and lower Salw\u00edn forests lie east of the Salw\u00edn, and on the Hlaing-bhwai and its feeders; they are chiefly valuable for their supply of crooked timber. Teak is found here only on level ground; but its growth is irregular, owing principally to the remains of old taungya cultivation. The teak forests are open and much exposed to jungle fires. (3) The Thaung-y\u00edn forests, on the hills forming the west watershed of the Thaung-y\u00edn river, contain regularly-grown trees of gigantic size. Bamboo and pyingado also abound in this tract. The teak localities in parts are hedged in by dense evergreen forest, stretching down to the banks of the Thaung-y\u00edn and its tributaries. Some of the most valuable teak in British Burma is found on the sandstone of the hills between the Thaung-y\u00edn and its tributary the Meh-pa-leh. In one locality, 550 first-class trees occupied an area of $\\frac{1}{3}$ of a square mile. These are tall and regular. Of five trees taken at random from among the larger ones of the Meh-pa-leh forest, the average girth was 11 feet, and the length of stem to first branch 74 feet. Higher up the hills, teak localities give place to impenetrable forests, where the height of the trees nearly equals that of the Wellingtonia of California. A specimen of *dipterocarpus* had a girth of 20 feet, and a height to the first branch of 160 feet. (4) The Haung-tharaw forests have been stripped of their best trees; teak is now found only in isolated patches. At one locality above the fall of the '99 islands,' the trees were magnificent; but the teak had been converted into short logs and afterwards abandoned, owing to the impossibility of conveyance down the channel between the islands. These logs, after ten years' exposure, were still sound. During the last few years, attempts have been made to clear the channel of the Haung-tharaw by blasting. In 1873\u201374, 545 tons of stone were thus removed near the '99 islands.' (5) The Attaran forests are situated on both banks of the Zam\u00ed (Zamee) and Winraw, and cover an area of 100 square miles. For some years after the cession of Martaban and Tenasserim, the timber was so recklessly felled\u2014the grantees working for speedy returns\u2014that in 1850 only two small teak forests had been left. In 1860 the greater number of trees were found to be hollow or attacked with epiphytic ficus. At this time it was proposed that these tracts should continue in the hands of private parties; subsequently, however, they were declared 'reserved Government forests.' Such tracts were worked under one-\nyear permits for the removal of seasoned timber only. Where the private tenure was recognised, thirty-year permits were given, and the removal of timber under 7 feet 6 inches in girth was strictly prohibited. *Padauk*, furnishing a hard, heavy wood; *anan* (Fagroea fragrans), a timber hardening under water; *pyinma, thingan* (Hopea odorata), and numerous other valuable timbers abound.\n\nThe Geological Formation of Amherst District has never been completely examined by a professional survey. A conspicuous and picturesque feature in the country round Maulmain and in the Salwin valley, is the massive limestone occurring in steeply-scarped hills with overhanging cliffs, which exhibit the appearance of what they undoubtedly were at no remote period in geologic time, i.e. seagirt rocks. These, even now, during the rains can only be approached by boats. In the hills there are 23 groups of caves, of which those above the sea level promise a rich harvest to future explorers. Lead ore occurs in the Taung-nyo Hills, and near Martaban, schorl rock and crystals, schist, and hornblendic rock are found. Hot springs exist in eleven places in Amherst District, and are always found near the limestone outcrops. The largest and most important are at Attaran Yeb\u00fa (Yeboo), on the Attaran, about two miles inland from the old town of Attaran. Here there are ten hot-water ponds, in some of which the temperature is 130\u00b0 F.; carbonic acid is evolved in large quantities, and the ground around the springs is highly impregnated with iron. The Attaran springs are said to approach in their composition nearest to the celebrated spring of T\u00f6plitz, and their medical properties render them excellent remedies in a number of diseases, especially liver complaints. The Burmese use the waters in cases of fever and skin-disease. Dr. Morton found on analysis that the springs contain much calcareous matter; they deposit carbonate of lime.\n\nHistory.\u2014The history of Amherst District is for many centuries a monotonous chronicle of wars and incursions. Claimed by the Siamese on the east, and by the Peguans on the west, the country had no rest until the former were expelled and the latter conquered by the Burmese. The ancient capital, Martaban, was founded in 1269 A.D. by Narapad\u00eds\u00edth\u00fa, a Burmese King of Pagan, who erected a Buddhist Pagoda there, and planted a colony of thirty families to take charge of it. Aleinma was appointed governor. At this time the country east of the Salwin belonged to Siam. On Aleinma\u2019s refusal to appear at the Court of Narapad\u00eds\u00edth\u00fa\u2019s son and successor, Talapya was appointed in his place. But, aided by the Shans, the ex-governor soon returned, drove out and killed Talapya, and resumed office, probably as tributary to Siam. For many years the Burmese kingdom was harassed by the Chinese from the north, and its sovereigns were unable to exert any authority in the south. Magad\u00fa, a native trader of Martaban, who had risen in favour\nat the Siamese Court, was appointed governor of the capital during one of the king's absences. He eloped with the king's daughter, and, returning to Martaban, treacherously murdered Aleinma. In 1281 he was recognised by the King of Siam, and from this time is known in history as King Wariy\u00fa. Wariy\u00fa's ambition was not yet satisfied. North of Martaban lay a country called Kanpalan\u00ed (Kanpalanee), which he eventually conquered. Whilst the King of Kanpalan\u00ed was away on a hunting excursion, his capital was pillaged, and his daughter made captive. About this time the King of Martaban aided the King of Pegu, who had also effected his independence, in expelling the Chinese, who had defeated the King of Pagan and were attacking Pegu. Quarrels soon arose between the two monarchs, which ended in Wariy\u00fa's annexing Pegu. This king was succeeded by his brother, who perished in a rebellion. In the reign of the next sovereign, Zawaw-bin-maing, Labon, Tavoy, and Tenasserim were added to the kingdom, which already extended nearly to Prome on the north and to Bassein on the west. From this time the history of Martaban merges in that of Pegu. Between 1563 and 1581 Caesar Frederic, the Venetian, visited Martaban; he found there 'ninety Portugal merchants and other base men which had fallen at difference with the governor of the city.' The King of Pegu 'had gone with a million and four hundred thousand men to conquer the kingdom of Siam,' and in his absence the Portuguese caused a disturbance in the capital. From this time the country was the theatre of continual wars and rebellions. The kings of Siam succeeded in re-annexing the site of the modern Maulmain and the territory to the south, and in conquering the portion of the Province lying east of the Salw\u00edn. In the latter half of the 18th century, Alaungpay\u00e1 and his successors obtained possession of the country, and retained it till after the first Anglo-Burmese war, when the Burmese were forced to cede to the British the tract east of the Salw\u00edn (1826); the remaining portion was annexed after the second Burmese war by Lord Dalhousie, in 1853.\n\nAntiquities.\u2014Bhil\u00fa (Bheeloo) island, in the estuary of the Salw\u00edn, alone contains 60 pagodas. Tradition fondly alleges that the Kalaw pagoda was erected in order to receive a relic of Gautama during the reign of the Indian Buddhist King Asoka. The most famous pagodas at Martaban are the Myathiendhan (1282 A.D.), attributed to King Wariy\u00fa; the Shwe Dagon, ascribed to 1288 A.D.; the Kyaik-kha-pan pagoda, built in 1199 A.D. by Aleinma. The Tha-t\u00fan (Tha-hoon) pagoda is the oldest and most celebrated of all. The Burmese chroniclers absurdly assign it to the year 594 B.C. It is said to have been built in honour of a visit of Gautama Buddha, and as a receptacle for a hair of the holy man. The chief pagoda at Maulmain is the Kyaikthan-lan, built on the northern spur of the hill near Martaban. There\nare several small but ancient pagodas near Maulmain containing relics of Buddha. Tha-t\u00fan (Tha-htoon) and Martaban, once the capitals of independent kingdoms, are now in ruins, but still exhibit traces of their former importance.\n\nPopulation.\u2014Before 1826, Amherst was the scene of perpetual warfare between the kings of Siam and Pegu, and was ravaged in turn by their troops, and by the Burmese armies of Alaungpay\u00e1 and his successors. When the country east of the Salw\u00edn was annexed in 1826, it was found to be almost uninhabited. In February 1827, Maung Sat, a rebel Talaing chief, known to the English of that day as the Syriam R\u00e1j\u00e1, settled, with 10,000 followers, in Maulmain and its neighbourhood. After a few years, a further influx of 20,000 immigrants from Burmese territory took place. In 1829, the population of the country stretching from the Thaung-yin to the Pakchan (which includes the present Districts of Tavoy and Mergui) was about 70,000 souls. In 1835 it had risen to 85,000, and in 1845 to 127,455. This rapid increase was due to immigration from Pegu native territory, and on a small scale from India to Maulmain, which rose from a fishing village into a flourishing town. In 1855, Amherst District comprised only the country east of the Salw\u00edn (Salween) between the Thaung-yin river and Tavoy District, and had a population of 83,146. In 1860 this number had increased to 130,953, and in 1870 to 235,747. During this decade Tha-t\u00fan sub-division was transferred from Shwe-gyin District. In 1872, at the first regular Census, the District population was, exclusive of Maulmain town, which is now constituted a separate District, 193,468. By February 1881 the inhabitants had increased to 301,086, or by 64 per cent. in nine years. The Census was taken over an area of 15,189 square miles, and in 1021 villages; number of houses, 53,906, of which 50,483 were occupied, and 3423 unoccupied; average persons per square mile, 19\u00b782; towns or villages per square mile, 0\u00b707; number of houses per square mile, 3\u00b754; persons per occupied house, 5\u00b796. Classified according to sex, there were 160,221 males and 140,865 females. Divided according to religion, there were Buddhists, 283,072; Muhammadans, 7599; Hindus, 6690; Christians, 3040; n\u00e1t or demon-worshippers, 685. The disproportion between the sexes (males, 53\u00b722 per cent.; females, 46\u00b778) is chiefly owing to the large immigration of male labourers. During the Burmese occupation of the country, the coast tracts of Tenasserim were peopled chiefly by Talaings, called by themselves \u2018M\u00fan;\u2019 and they now form over 11 per cent. of the population. It is not known whether this tribe came directly down the Irawadi (Irrawaddy) from Pegu, or whether they migrated via the Brahmaputra, and so through Arakan to their present settlements. At a later date, Dravidians from Teling\u00e1na established trading colonies in \u2018Ram\u00e1yana\u2019\u2014i.e., the country between\nthe mouths of the Salwin and Bassein rivers. These colonists soon merged in the wild race of the M\u00fcn, and their name, 'Talaing,' by which this mixed people is known to all but themselves, alone shows their connection with 'Teling\u00e1na.' Their language is harsh and guttural, and essentially different from Burmese; and after the first Anglo-Burmese war, it was cruelly proscribed by the Burmese sovereign. In Pegu it has almost died out, but still prevails in Amherst District. The Karens generally occupy the hilly country in the District, and both Sgaw and Pwo or Pgho are fully represented. The pure Burmese are few in number. The Taungh\u00fas are an isolated race; they are swarthy and sturdily built, and have a language, dress, and customs of their own. They have no written character, but their traditions are preserved to them by professional story-tellers. The Arakanese and the Shans may be considered as permanent settlers, as are also some of the Hindus and Muhammadans, amongst whom are included Burmese women converted before marriage with Musalm\u00e1ns. Such marriages are frequent. Many Hindus and Muhammadans, however, only come to the District to make a little money, and look forward to returning to India. On the banks of the Attaran there is a Muhammadan colony. The Hindus are clustered in the towns and villages near Maulmain. The number of towns and villages in Amherst in 1881 was 1021\u2014of which 495 contained less than 200 inhabitants, 400 from 200 to 500, 95 from 500 to 1000, 25 between 1000 and 2000, 4 from 2000 to 3000, and 2 from 3000 to 5000. The chief towns are MAULMAIN, AMHERST, and MARTABAN, although the former is now separately administered. MAULMAIN is situated at the points of junction of the Salwin, Gyaing, and Attaran rivers, in lat. 16\u00b0 38' N. and in long. 97\u00b0 38' E. Although now created an independent District, it is within the limits of Amherst, and is the head-quarters of the District. It was made a cantonment in 1826 for the main body of the troops in Tenasserim by General Sir Archibald Campbell. He selected it as the best position to overawe the Burmese, who still retained Pegu, and had a force at Martaban on the opposite bank of the Salwin. Its natural fertility and the discovery of the valuable teak forests, together with the cruelties of the Burmese in Pegu, induced immigration, and Maulmain sprang into importance. In 1881 the population amounted to 53,107. AMHERST (Kyaik Kham\u00ed) is a small station on the sea-coast, in lat. 16\u00b0 15' N. and in long. 97\u00b0 34' E. On the cession of Tenasserim it was chosen to be the seat of the local Government, and called after Lord Amherst, the Governor-General; but in 1827 Maulmain became the head-quarters station. MARTABAN came under British rule in 1854, and was transferred from Shwe-gyin District to Amherst in 1864\u201365. It once formed the capital of an independent State, but afterwards belonged at different periods to Burma, Pegu, and Siam, until its capture by the English.\nAgriculture, etc.\u2014The cultivated portions of the District are Tha-t\u00fan sub-division (forming about five-sixteenths of the whole cultivated area), Bil\u00fa (Bheeloo) island, the plains east of Maulmain, the tract between the Taung-nyo Hills and the sea stretching from Maulmain to Amherst town, and the country around Ye in the south. The plains between the Salw\u00edn and Hlaing-bhwai, and the Haung-tharaw and Attaran are almost entirely inundated during the rains, and sometimes are several feet under water. Rice is the chief produce; it is extensively grown along the banks of the Gyaing. In 1869\u201370, the total area under tillage was 318 square miles; in 1873\u201374, 401; in 1875\u201376, 461; and in 1881\u201382, 587 square miles. In the last-mentioned year, 513 square miles were under rice, and the gross yield of unhusked rice was about 246,259 tons. Dhani and betel palms are largely cultivated; tobacco and sesamum are also grown; cotton in small quantities only, and chiefly by the Karens on the hill-sides, as other crops at present are more profitable. In 1875\u201376, there were 1189 sugar-cane plantations. Some of the cane is exported to Rangoon. The number of taungyas, or jungle clearings, is small, the hillmen being few. The land is almost entirely in the hands of small proprietors holding it direct from the State, and cultivating it themselves, aided by the members of their families. Occasionally labourers are hired, who are paid in kind to the value of from 6 to 8 rupees (12s. to 16s.) a month, according as they live and board with their employers or not. There are no large landed proprietors in the District. The average size of a holding is from 10 to 15 acres, and the average rent from 2 to 3 rupees (4s. to 6s.) per acre.\n\n**AREA UNDER CULTIVATION IN AMHERST DISTRICT IN ACRES.**\n\n| Year    | Rice   | Sugar | Cotton | Vegetables | Betelnut | Cocoanut | Dhani | Fruits | All other kinds | Total Acres |\n|---------|--------|-------|--------|------------|----------|----------|-------|--------|----------------|-------------|\n| 1855-56 | 77,459 | ...   | ...    | Unknown    | ...      | ...      | ...   | ...    | 13,329         | 90,788      |\n| 1868-69 | 161,345| 133   | 1313   | 7180       | 3430     | 110      | 3083  | 12,930 | 3,009          | 192,533     |\n| 1869-70 | 170,400| 948   | 569    | 7702       | 3375     | 1023     | 4262  | 12,470 | 3,262          | 204,011     |\n| 1870-71 | 176,998| 875   | 599    | 7660       | 3386     | 1062     | 4312  | 13,754 | 2,955          | 211,601     |\n| 1871-72 | 187,353| 834   | 1610   | 3375       | 1062     | 4307     | 12,601| 2,439  |                | 213,581     |\n| 1872-73 | 197,082| 993   | 1016   | No returns | 3472     | 1066     | 4644  | 12,585 | 2,520          | 223,378     |\n| 1873-74 | 220,497| 955   | 877    |            | 3468     | 1060     | 4585  | 12,731 | 2,249          | 246,422     |\n| 1874-75 | 242,848| 1107  | 778    |            | 3500     | 1060     | 4643  | 14,027 | 2,530          | 270,493     |\n| 1880-81 | 304,070| 1423  | 571    | 4476       | 3697     | 1226     | 5180  | 11,509 | 1,530          | 333,682     |\n| 1881-82 | 328,345| 1439  | 651    | 2520       | 3763     | 1241     | 5383  | 12,084 | 5,462          | 350,883     |\n\nIn 1881\u201382, 4733 square miles of cultivable land were still waiting for cultivators; while 9929 square miles were returned as uncultivable. The agricultural stock has rapidly increased. Between 1855\u201356 and 1881 the number of buffaloes rose from 36,501 to 90,645; cows, bulls,\nand bullocks, from 5297 to 79,247; carts, from 2356 to 9068; ploughs, from 1029 to 32,448; and boats, from 4320 to 6094. The most important natural product is teak, which, since the country came into our possession, has formed the staple article of local commerce. Indeed, the District owes its early prosperity to the timber trade, and the impetus which it gave to immigration. Most of the timber is of foreign growth, and is brought down the rivers from Siam and Chengmai for shipment at Maulmain. The mode of bringing it to market is as follows:\u2014The selected trees are first girdled; three years later they are felled, marked, and dragged by elephants to the bed of the stream which taps the forests, and left there until the rains, when the waters rise. They then float down\u2014in some cases untouched and unseen, and in others, as in the Thaung-yin, followed and guided by men and elephants\u2014till they reach the kyodan, or rope station, where their further progress is arrested. Here parties of foresters are stationed, who recognise their own timber, draw the logs to the bank, and form them into rafts. These are taken by raftsmen to the Government timber-station, where they must be entered in the forest revenue books, and the duty, if any, paid before they can be taken farther down the river to the ships awaiting them, or to the saw-pits at Maulmain. At the kyodan on the Salwin, where the river, narrowed to a third of its ordinary breadth, runs between two perpendicular cliffs, an immense cable, stretched across, intercepts the floating logs as they collect during the night. At dawn, numbers of foresters are seen, each trying to get his own logs ashore and clear of the rest. Sometimes the weight of the timber snaps the cable, and the whole mass is carried swiftly down the river, either to be stranded by the current or lost by being drifted out to sea, or to be landed by practised men, who make this their profession and receive salvage at a fixed scale. The other natural products are gamboge and stick-lac; the ka-nyin, yielding a varnishing oil; and a drug having all the properties of camphor, extracted by distillation from a plant belonging to the sub-division of Verbenaceae eupatoriae. Communication is carried on chiefly by boat. Total length of water communication within the District, 500 miles. A metalled road runs southwards as far as Kwan-hla, a distance of 38 miles. It will eventually be prolonged to Tavoy and Mergui. At Kwan-hla, a branch road leads westward to Amherst, 16 miles distant; a road leads from Maulmain to the Gyaing; and a short metalled way, 4\u00bd miles, connects Zemathway with Tha-tun (Tha-htoo). Another road has been made from Martaban northwards to Tha-tun, and thence to Shwe-gyin. Total length of roads in the District, 62 miles. A telegraph line extends from Maulmain past Tha-tun to Shwe-gyin (with a branch thence to Rangoon) and on to Taung-ngu (Toung-gnoo), and another line runs from Maulmain to Amherst.\nManufactures, etc.\u2014Sugar is manufactured for home consumption and for export, chiefly in Tha-t\u00fan. The demand for rice and teak in the English and Indian markets, the discovery of valuable forests, the rapid increase of population, and the convenient position of Maulmain, gave a great stimulus to trade. The principal exports are timber and rice. The first shipment of teak to England was in 1839. It is now sent in large quantities to the United Kingdom and to India, to continental Europe, and in small quantities to the Straits. In 1873\u201374, the value of timber exported was \u00a3582,483, and in 1881\u201382, \u00a3823,009. Rice was formerly sent chiefly to the Straits, but now large shipments are made to Europe and India. In 1876\u201377, its total export was 56,383 tons, and in 1881\u201382, 56,726 tons. In 1881\u201382, 7 steam rice cleaning mills were at work in the District, besides several steam saw-mills. There is a small trade in hides and cotton. The principal imports are cotton and woollen piece-goods, twist, tea, sugar and sugar-candy, spirits, vegetable oils, silk goods, and tobacco. In 1855\u201356, the value of imports was \u00a3358,302, of exports \u00a3439,092\u2014total, \u00a3797,394; in 1864\u201365, the value of imports was \u00a3693,021, of exports \u00a3874,834\u2014total, \u00a31,567,855; in 1875\u201376, the imports were \u00a3598,738, exports \u00a31,184,436\u2014total, \u00a31,783,174; in 1880\u201381, the imports (including treasure) were \u00a3979,011, and the exports \u00a31,482,580\u2014total, \u00a32,461,591. In 1881\u201382, the imports amounted to \u00a31,004,066, and the exports to \u00a31,400,837\u2014total, \u00a32,404,903. This represents the foreign and coasting trade; but there is also a considerable inland trade between Amherst and Siam, the imports mainly comprising cattle and sheep, and the exports of English piece-goods. In 1880\u201381, the value of this trade was\u2014imports \u00a314,554, exports \u00a35137; but this is greatly below the average, owing to the fact that the passes were for a time in the hands of a gang of Siamese d\u00e1k\u00e1its.\n\nAdministration.\u2014On the cession of the Tenasserim Provinces, they were considered so unproductive that at one time their surrender was seriously contemplated. The discovery of the teak forests, however, soon proved a source of wealth and prosperity. In 1855\u201356, the total revenue of Amherst District, exclusive of Tha-t\u00fan (Tha-htoo), derived from land, capitation, fisheries, customs, excise, etc., amounted to \u00a344,936; in 1862\u201363, to \u00a393,486; in 1872\u201373, to \u00a3137,737; in 1875, to \u00a3168,741; and in 1881\u201382, to \u00a3121,400, or including Maulmain town, to \u00a3181,964. The land revenue alone rose from \u00a340,319 in 1872 to \u00a345,313 in 1873, and to \u00a363,221 in 1881\u201382. This increase was owing to the enlarged area of taxable land, caused partly by the improvement in the rice trade, and partly by cultivable land having been reclaimed in the Tha-t\u00fan and Zaya townships. For some years after the cession of Tenasserim, the land revenue was\nrepresented by a levy of 25 per cent. upon the crop, calculated at an average *ad valorem* rate dependent on the market price of grain. In 1834 this system was abolished, and payment by acreage substituted. Two rupees 8 annas (5s.) per acre were fixed as the maximum rent of the best lands. In addition to the imperial revenue, a local revenue is raised from town and District funds, and the cess levied on the land revenue and fisheries. In 1872, the local rates amounted to \u00a32837; in 1875-76, to \u00a35445. For administrative purposes the District is divided into 11 townships\u2014viz., Tha-t\u00fan (Tha-htoo), Hpagat, Martaban, B\u00edl\u00fagyun (Bheeloogywon), Than-lwin-Hlaing-bhwai, Gyaing-Than-lwin, Gyaing-Attaran, Zaya, W\u00e1kar\u00fa (Wakharoo), Ye-Lamaing, Haung-tharaw. These are subdivided into revenue circles. Judicial staff\u2014a Judge at Maulmain, with civil and criminal jurisdiction; and 18 presiding officers in the District, of whom 14 have civil, criminal, and revenue powers. In 1882 the regular police force, excluding Maulmain town, was 719 men, maintained at a cost of \u00a316,948. Crimes of violence are chiefly committed by the Karens, Taung-th\u00fas, and Shans; and in 1880-81, an organized robber gang held undisturbed sway over the passes near the Siamese border, and completely closed the roads, and put a stop to trade for several months. The jail at Maulmain is one of the central prisons of British Burma. In 1880, the total number of prisoners was 2292, the daily average prison population being 333. They are employed in gardening, wicker and coir work, tailoring, cotton-spinning, stone-breaking, etc. Including Maulmain town, the District contained 361 schools in 1880-81, with 8295 pupils, of which 129 received some form of aid from Government, and 232 were unaided indigenous monastic schools. These last have been lately brought under Government supervision, as a means of spreading sound primary instruction among the people. In 1873, 89 of these schools were visited with the consent of the Buddhist P\u00fangy\u00eds, or teachers, and the pupils examined. In 1880-81, 350 such schools were inspected by the Government examiners, and 118 of them received grants-in-aid. The Census Report of 1881 returned 8438 boys and 1092 girls as under instruction; and 34,738 males and 967 females as able to read and write, but not under instruction. Two newspapers are published in the District. The Government High School, established in Maulmain in 1835, had 110 pupils on its roll in 1880-81. St. Patrick's School was started in 1842 by the Roman Catholic Mission; the Maung-gan Anglo-Vernacular School is now incorporated with it. In Maulmain, the Morton Lane and St. Joseph's Schools, and the Church of England Orphanage, are for girls only. In 1843 the American Baptist Mission set up a Normal school in Maulmain for Karens, in which Burmese is taught. Speaking generally, the education of Burmese women has hitherto been neglected, but they are inde-\npendent, active, and shrewd. The petty trade is almost exclusively in their hands.\n\nClimate, etc.\u2014Fevers and rheumatism are the most prevalent diseases. The average annual rainfall at Maulmain for the 32 years ending in 1881, was 189.67 inches. In 1881, 205.88 inches of rain fell in Maulmain town. The temperature in the same year was thus returned\u2014May, max. 99.9\u00b0 F., min. 73.5\u00b0; July, max. 85.8\u00b0, min. 71.5\u00b0; December, max. 91.4\u00b0, min. 61.7\u00b0. Amherst District has suffered terribly from cattle-disease, which is imported almost annually from the Shan States. In 1876, between January 1st and August 30th, 12,562 cattle died. [A considerable literature has of late years sprung up with regard to British Burma, and several excellent works are now available to the public. It would be invidious for me to make selections among these books for special mention. But for additional official information the following authoritative works may be consulted:\u2014The British Burma Gazetteer, 2 vols., 1879 and 1880; the Burma Census Report of 1881; the Provincial Administration Reports for 1880\u201381 to 1882\u201383; and the Meteorological Report for 1881.]\n\nAmherst.\u2014Town in Amherst District, British Burma, on the W\u00e1kar\u00fa (Wakharoo) river; lat. 16\u00b0 4\u2032 40\u2033 N., long. 97\u00b0 35\u2032 30\u2033 E. It is situated on the sea-coast about 30 miles south of Maulmain by river and 54 by road, on an elevation, airy and open to the sea-breeze. On account of its accessible position, on a river which is navigable for some distance and possessing a good harbour at its mouth, Amherst was, in 1826, made the capital of the Province. It was called after Lord Amherst, the Governor-General; its native name is Kyaik Kham\u00ed. In 1827 the head-quarters were transferred to Maulmain. As a sanitarium, Amherst is strongly recommended; on the inland side, the town is sheltered by a bold range of wooded hills, and it is a favourite summer retreat of the people of Maulmain. For some years it was garrisoned by a small detachment, afterwards replaced by a police guard. Amherst is now important only as a pilot station with a telegraph office. Population in 1881, 2953.\n\nAmi.\u2014River of the North-Western Provinces; rising from a small lake in Basti District, and flowing in an easterly and south-easterly direction, it falls into the R\u00e1pti on its left bank. Except during the rains, the river, though deep in some places, is a narrow sluggish stream. Its waters are extensively used for irrigation, and the fisheries are valuable. The river is bridged at three places. During the rains it is navigable by boats of about four tons burthen; but the course of the stream being difficult to follow owing to floods, and to sunken trees, navigation is attended with some risk. Very little deposit is left behind by the subsiding of the floods, but what there is, is a fertilizing loam, and the crops grown thereon are exceptionally good.\nAmindivi Islands.\u2014See Laccadives.\n\nAmingadh.\u2014Town in Kal\u00e1dgi District, Bombay Presidency; 9 miles west of Hungund, and 34 miles south-east of Kal\u00e1dgi.

The town has a post-office and a large cattle market\u2014the sale of cattle is said to reach the yearly value of \u00a32500. It is also a great mart for cocoa-nuts and rice, which reach Amingadh westwards from the sea-coast.\n\nAmjhera.\u2014Revenue division of Gwalior State, in M\u00e1lwa, Central India, comprising 250 villages, and lying between lat. $22^\\circ 16'$ and $22^\\circ 47'$ N., and between long. $74^\\circ 40'$ and $75^\\circ 15'$ E. It was formerly a petty State. In the Mutiny of 1857, the chief was tried and hanged for rebellion; and eventually the State lapsed to Sindhia, with the outlying pargan\u00e1s of B\u00e1gh, Bankaner, Man\u00e1war, Dikth\u00e1n, and S\u00e1g\u00f3r. Area, 584 square miles; extent from north-east to south-west, 42 miles, and from south-east to north-west, 33 miles.\u2014Revenue, \u00a327,366. Opium is cultivated to a considerable extent; other special crops are cotton, maize, sugar-cane, etc. Chief town, Amjhera, $12\\frac{1}{2}$ miles west from Dh\u00e1r. The town was once populous, but is now in ruins; it has a fine tank, with a good camping ground to the eastward.\n\nAmliy\u00e1ra.\u2014See Amalyara.\n\nAmmapet.\u2014Town in Salem District, Madras Presidency. Lat. $12^\\circ 9' 15''$ N., long. $78^\\circ 41'$ E.; population (1881) 7003; namely, 6704 Hindus, 278 Muhammadans, and 21 Christians; houses, 1181. A suburb of Salem town.\n\nAmm\u00e1y\u00e1n\u00e1yakan\u00far.\u2014Large estate in Dindigal t\u00e1luk, Mad\u00fara District, Madras Presidency. The battle fought here in 1741 decided the fate of Dindigal, which thus fell into the hands of Chanda S\u00e1hib; and the estate also figured somewhat conspicuously in the incursion of Haidar Ali (1757). It was one of the five palaiyams which the invader failed to resume, but it was afterwards sequestrated by Tipu S\u00e1hib. On the British occupation, it was restored to its original status as a tributary palaiyam, and assessed at \u00a31397 per annum. In 1862 an increase to \u00a31508 was recommended. Government, however, decided that the original assessment, reduced by \u00a33, should be considered permanent. The South Indian Railway passes through this estate, with a station at the head-quarters town of Amm\u00e1y\u00e1n\u00e1yakan\u00far.\n\nAmm\u00e1y\u00e1n\u00e1yakan\u00far.\u2014Village in Dindigal t\u00e1luk, Mad\u00fara District, Madras Presidency.

Celebrated as the site of a battle between the J\u00e1gird\u00e1r\nand the Niz\u00e1m, 7000 Muhammadan tombs being still pointed out; also for an old temple to Mah\u00e1deo on the river bank, with miracle-pool below. Government school.\n\n**Amner** (or *Jilpi-Amner*).\u2014Small fort in the Melgh\u00e1t, in the north of Ellichpur District, Ber\u00e1r. Lat. 21\u00b0 31' 45\" N., long. 76\u00b0 49' 30\" E. Stands in a commanding position at the apex of the triangle formed by the junction of the Garga and T\u00e1pt\u00ed rivers, the only approach being from the north-west, on a level with the left bank of the T\u00e1pt\u00ed, which, though here entirely of earth, is very steep and lofty. The fort covers about an acre, is quadrangular in shape, built of brick, and has four flanking bastions. A mosque with minarets in its west angle is a conspicuous and picturesque object. Dismantled, and its guns removed in 1858.\n\n**Amod.**\u2014Sub-division of Broach District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 176 square miles, containing 1 town and 47 villages; occupied houses, 8483; population (1881) 39,641, or 225 to the square mile. Hindus numbered 27,653; Muhammadans, 7837; 'others,' 4151. Of the total area, 81 per cent. is cultivated, 3\u00bd per cent. cultivable waste, 8 per cent. uncultivable waste, and 7\u00bd per cent. occupied by village sites, roads, tanks, and rivers. In the neighbourhood of the Dh\u00e1dhar river, which forms its north boundary, the country is wooded. Chiefly black cotton soil; water supply deficient. Of the cultivated area, grain crops occupy a third, and cotton a half.\n\n**Amod.**\u2014Chief town of the Sub-division of the same name in Broach District, Bombay Presidency; about a mile south of the Dh\u00e1dhar river, 21 miles north of Broach, and 30 miles south-west of Baroda.

Bounded on the north by Bet\u00fal District, on the east by the river Wardha, which marks the whole boundary in this direction, on the south by B\u00e1sim and W\u00fan Districts, and on the west by Akola and Ellichpur Districts. Area, 2759 square miles, of which 2327 square miles were returned in 1880-81 as cultivated, 108 square miles as cultivable, and 324 as uncultivable waste; population according to the Census of 1881, 575,328, or 208$\\frac{1}{2}$ per square mile. Number of towns and villages, 1015; and of revenue sub-divisions, 4. Land revenue (1881), \u00a3157,598; total revenue (gross), \u00a3202,099. The District is sub-divided for fiscal purposes into the following t\u00e1luks, viz:\u2014Amr\u00e1oti, Chandur, Morsi, and Murtazapur. The town of Amr\u00e1oti is the administrative head-quarters of the District, and of the Commissionership of East Ber\u00e1r.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Amr\u00e1oti District is a plain about 800 feet above sea level, with a gentle slope from north to south; parts of it are considerably higher, and the general flatness is broken by a chain of barren rocky hills between Amr\u00e1oti and Ch\u00e1ndur. Soil extremely fertile, principally a black loam, except in the higher parts of the District, where it is shallow and poor. The river P\u00farna flows westward through a part of the District, and for about 16 miles marks the boundary between it and Ellichpur; the remaining streams, forming deep channels in the rainy season, run eastward, and drain into the Wardha, which is not navigable in Amr\u00e1oti District. Game of the larger sorts still abounds in the wooded parts of the District, in which the area of reserved forests is 26,268 acres, and of unreserved 62,672 acres. Forest area of Amr\u00e1oti Hills, 78 square miles. The District forests yielded in 1880-81 a total revenue to Government of \u00a35891; expenditure, \u00a3905.\n\nHistory.\u2014Tradition relates that a great company of Warh\u00e1r\u00eds, who had come to Amr\u00e1oti to witness the votive ceremonies of Rukmini before her marriage, settled there, and gave their name to the country now called Ber\u00e1r, which was held by R\u00e1jput princes for some centuries. Amr\u00e1oti, with the rest of Ber\u00e1r, fell to Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, nephew and son-in-law to the Delhi Emperor Feroz Ghilzai, in 1294. The rise and fall of the B\u00e1hmani dynasty (1347-1525), the ninety years of Ber\u00e1r independence under the Im\u00e1d Sh\u00e1hi princes, its eventual cession to Akbar (1596), belong to the history of the Province rather than to the account of Amr\u00e1oti District. After the death of Aurangzeb, Chin Khilich Kh\u00e1n, viceroy of the Deccan, under the title of N\u00edz\u00e1m ul Mulk, obtained in 1724, as the fruit of three victories, a divided dominion with the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. From this date, Ber\u00e1r has been always nominally subject to the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d dynasty. By the partition treaty of 1804,\nthe whole of Ber\u00e1r was made over to the Niz\u00e1m; and Amr\u00e1oti, as a part of it, is included in the Districts assigned to the British Government by the Niz\u00e1m, under the treaties of 1853 and 1861.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1867 showed a population of 407,276, on an area of 2566 square miles. The returns of 1877 showed a population of 546,448, on an area of 2767 square miles. The Census of 1881 returned the population at 575,328 souls, on an area of 2759 square miles, as follows: Adult males, 201,792; adult females, 182,485; children below 12\u2014males 96,259, females 94,792: total males, 298,051; total females, 277,277. The excess of births over deaths is stated to be 16 per cent. Classified according to religion, there were\u2014Christians, 366; Sikhs, 119; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 103; Hindus, 527,467; Muhammadans, 41,118; Jains, 6127; 1 Buddhist, and 27 professing aboriginal religions. According to castes, Br\u00e1hmans in 1881 numbered 15,936; R\u00e1jputs, 11,706; K\u00fanbis, 159,768; M\u00e1l\u00eds, 57,127; Mahars, 79,492; other Hindu castes, 192,108; non-Hindus or aborigines, 17,484. The aborigines that have been returned are stamped by their physical appearance and customs as belonging to an earlier type than the general population. The agricultural population numbered 312,417; the non-agricultural, 262,911; occupying 102,190 houses, or an average of 5\u00b76 souls to each house. Each Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 village, according to custom, has a pat\u00e9l and a patw\u00e1ri at its head; the pat\u00e9ls are usually K\u00fanbis, but a few are Br\u00e1hmans. The pola, a great festival, is annually celebrated in the villages in honour of the plough cattle. There are seven principal fairs, at which many curious local customs are observed. The principal towns are\u2014Amr\u00e1oti, pop. 23,550; Karanja, 10,923; Badnera, 6460; Khola-pur, 6452; Talegaon, 5506; Mangrul, 6122; Morshi, 5592; Ner Pinglai, 6644; Shendurjana, 8501; Warud, 6607; Murtazapur, 4837; Anjangaon-Bari, 2888. Of the 1015 villages comprising the District in 1881, 375 contained less than two hundred inhabitants, 330 had from two to five hundred, 188 from five hundred to a thousand, 77 from one to two thousand, 21 from two to three thousand, 14 from three to five thousand, 8 from five to ten thousand, and 2 upwards of ten thousand. As regards occupation, the Census Report classifies the male population into the following six divisions\u2014(1) professional, 8343; (2) domestic, 2452; (3) commercial, 6431; (4) agricultural, 150,941; (5) industrial, 30,937; and (6) indefinite and non-productive, including male children, 98,947. The vernacular language of the people is Mar\u00e1th\u00ed and Urdu.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The staple crop is cotton, of which two varieties are said to be indigenous to Ber\u00e1r\u2014(1) Banni, sown towards the end of June, and ripens in November; (2) Jari, sown in the deep black soil of the P\u00farna valley, a fortnight later than banni, and seldom ready before the 15th December. Several varieties of pulse are grown.\nAmong vegetables, the potato is indifferent, but the yam is excellent; many cucurbitaceous and wild plants are raised or gathered. Irrigation is little resorted to, although storage tanks would be of great service in the hot season. The average rate per acre of land, in 1880\u201381, suited for cotton was 1s. 10\u00bdd.; wheat, 2s. 10d.; oil-seed, 2s. 1\u00bdd.; jo\u00e1r, 2s.; tobacco, 3s. 11d.; rice, 2s. 4\u00bdd.; gram, 2s. 2\u00bcd. The cultivated area in 1880\u201381 was 1,489,117 acres, of which 7608 acres only were irrigated. Grazing land, 85,948 acres. The most important crops were\u2014jo\u00e1r (great millet), 575,390 acres; cotton, 434,903; wheat, 129,388; linseed, 80,067; tobacco, 7308; b\u00e1jra, 2179; rice, 1045; gram, 27,225; tur, 78,391; til, 20,517; pulses, 700; hemp, 2717; kurdi, 1111; lac, 17,397; sugar-cane, 881; other products, 20,737. Jo\u00e1r is the staple food of the people, and its stalk (karbi) is the staple fodder for cattle. The agricultural stock of the District comprised in 1880\u201381, 294,555 cows and bullocks; 61,608 buffaloes; 2191 horses; 4908 ponies; 3477 donkeys; 96,657 sheep and goats; 694 pigs; 100 camels; 29,143 carts; 21,384 ploughs. The average produce of land per acre is\u2014cotton, 87 lbs.; wheat, 474 lbs.; oil-seeds, 274 lbs.; jo\u00e1r, 400 lbs.; tobacco, 312 lbs.; rice, 406 lbs.; and gram, 204 lbs.\n\nThe current prices ruling in the District in 1880\u201381, per rupee (2s.), were, for clean cotton, 2\u00bd sers or 5 lbs.; wheat, 23 sers; gram, 28 sers; rice, 10\u00bd sers; jo\u00e1r, 31 sers; oil-seed, 15 sers; tobacco, 2\u00bd sers. The rate of wages for skilled labour is 1s. 9d.; for unskilled, 4\u00bdd. per day.\n\n**Land Tenures.**\u2014The native collectors and revenue-farmers admitted no rights, except the prescriptive claims of resident cultivators, to hold at such rates as might be fixed, together with a few quasi-proprietary privileges in wells and orchard lands. Under British rule, the Bombay system of survey and settlement has been adopted, by which, subject to certain restrictions, the occupant is absolute proprietor of his holdings. The assessment is fixed for 30 years, and can then be enhanced only on good reason being shown. Under this system the proprietors often work co-operatively. The few large landowners cultivate most of their lands by hired labour, themselves supplying seed and plough cattle. Revenue free tenures are granted for village offices, personal services, religious and charitable endowments.\n\n**Natural Calamities.**\u2014In the great famine of 1839, many villages moved *en masse* towards Agra, streaming through S\u00e1g\u00e1r cantonments like files of ants, scrambling for every scrap of food and leaving a long line of corpses behind them. Hailstorms often cause great destruction to the crops.\n\n**Manufactures.**\u2014None, except coarse cotton cloth, and a few wooden articles for domestic use. Khol\u00e1pur is the seat of an ancient silk industry.\n\n**Trade.**\u2014Cotton, for which Amr\u00e1oti has long been famous, was\nanciently carried on pack-bullocks to Mirz\u00e2pur on the Ganges, 500 miles distant. The P\u00e2rsi merchants claim to have been the first to send the Amr\u00e1oti fibre to Bombay in 1825\u201326. The Great Indian Peninsula Railway has immensely developed the trade, and there are now several cotton presses at Amr\u00e1oti town. This city also carries on a large import trade in spices, salt, English piece-goods, and fine cotton stuffs from N\u00e1gpur; sugar, molasses, and turbans from Delhi, and gold embroidery from Benares. The internal traffic of the District is chiefly conducted by weekly markets, and at seven principal marts,\u2014viz. Kondanpur (a fair), Bhiltek, Amr\u00e1oti town, Morsi, Ch\u00e2nd\u00fbr, Murtaz\u00e2pur, Badnera.\n\nRoads and Railways.\u2014There were in 1880\u201381\u2014made roads, 522 miles; railways, 69 miles Great India Peninsula, with stations at short intervals, and 5\u00bd miles of State Railway from Badnera Junction (Great India Peninsula) to Amr\u00e1oti. The receipts for the latter line amounted in 1880\u201381 to \u00a33942.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The District is administered by a Deputy Commissioner, with whom are associated 20 assistants, and tahsild\u00e2rs or sub-divisional collectors. In 1877, the total revenue of the District amounted to \u00a3198,195, of which \u00a3153,978 was contributed by the land revenue. In 1880\u201381, the total revenue was returned at \u00a3202,099, of which \u00a3157,597 was derived from the land. The total cost of officials and police in 1881 was \u00a310,435. Justice is administered by 17 magistrates and 8 civil judges. Heinous crimes have greatly decreased under British rule, but convictions for petty offences have increased. There is one central jail at Amr\u00e1oti; daily average number of prisoners (1880), 546; yearly cost per head, \u00a36; death-rate, 3\u00b795 per cent. The Muhammadans, less than one-twelfth of the District population, supply more than a fifth of the prisoners, the remainder being chiefly low-caste Hindus or aborigines. Sanctioned strength of police, 96 officers and 487 men, being 1 to every 987 of the population. The proportion to area is 1 policeman to 5 square miles. Schools, aided and inspected by Government, numbered 99 in 1881, with 6003 scholars, and 70 indigenous schools with 1199 pupils. The Census Report of 1881 returned 6137 boys and 75 girls as under instruction; besides 14,691 males and 187 females as able to read and write, but not under instruction. The only municipality is Amr\u00e1oti town, constituted under Act IV. of 1873, but local committees for administration of town funds have recently been started in 41 villages in this District.\n\nMeteorological Aspects, etc.\u2014Hot weather begins in March, but without the scorching westerly winds of Upper India; and lasts till the rains set in about the middle of June. These continue for about three months, and the air is moist and cool. September and October are hot and steamy, and the most unhealthy months. The cold season lasts from November to end of February, but the sun is even then\npowerful in the middle of the day. Frost very rarely occurs. The temperature in May registers in the shade $114^\\circ$ Fahr.; in December the minimum reading is about $51^\\circ$ Fahr. The rainfall in 1880-81 at Amr\u00e1oti town was 16.40 inches, of which 13.30 fell between June and September. This, however, is much below the average, which is returned for the previous 22 years at 30.89 inches. The principal diseases are cholera, malarious fevers, bowel complaints, and skin affections. The number of deaths registered in 1880, from all causes, was 10,193; ratio of deaths per thousand, 20.9. Snake-bites and wild beasts killed 71 persons. The number of births registered in 1880 was 18,238, or 36.4 per 1000 of population. Seven charitable dispensaries afforded medical relief to 36,980 patients, at an expenditure of \u00a31443, contributed by Government, local funds, and subscriptions. In 1881, 20,061 persons were vaccinated by the staff of the Vaccination Department. [For further details, see the Ber\u00e1r Gazetteer, by A. C. Lyall, Esq., C.S., 1870; Provincial Administration Report, 1880-81; Census Report, 1881; Departmental Reports, 1880-81.\n\nAmr\u00e1oti.\u2014Head-quarters t\u00e1luk of Amr\u00e1oti District, Ber\u00e1r. Area, 672 square miles, containing 3 towns and 245 villages. Population (1881) 163,456, comprising 85,333 males and 78,123 females, or 243.23 persons per square mile. Hindus numbered 144,454; Sikhs, 41; Muhammadans, 16,824; Christians, 356; Jains, 1677; P\u00e1rs\u00eds, 77; \u2018others,\u2019 27. Area occupied by cultivators, 369,077 acres. The total revenue of Amr\u00e1oti t\u00e1luk in 1883 was \u00a359,121; the land revenue amounted to \u00a346,497. The number of civil courts was 3; of criminal courts, 4; of police stations, 5; of regular policemen, 302; of village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 364.\n\nAmr\u00e1oti.\u2014Municipal town and head-quarters of the District of same name, Ber\u00e1r. Lat. $20^\\circ 55' 45''$ N., long. $77^\\circ 47' 30''$ E.; population, according to Census of 1881, 23,550, comprising 12,859 males and 10,691 females. Of the total population, 17,675 were Hindus, 4725 Muhammadans, 851 Jains, 266 Christians, 20 Sikhs, and 13 P\u00e1rs\u00eds. A branch (State) railway of 6 miles joins the town with the Great Indian Peninsula line at Badnera, which is 411 miles from Bombay, 140 miles from N\u00e1gpur, and 1332 miles from Calcutta, by rail. Height above sea level, 1222 feet. A strong stone wall of from 20 to 26 feet high, circuit 2\u00bc miles, surrounds the town, having five gates and four wickets (khirki). The wall was begun in 1807 by the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s Government, to protect the wealthy traders from the Pind\u00e1ris. The Kh\u00ednd\u00e1ri (bloody) wicket is said to be so called from 700 persons having fallen in a fight close to it in 1818. The town is divided into two parts\u2014the Kasb\u00e1 and the Pet. In the middle of the last century a large number of people, who had been driven from Akola by the tyranny of the t\u00e1lukd\u00e1rs, emigrated to Amr\u00e1oti;\nand a new accession was derived from the same cause forty years ago. The water supply of the town is bad, most of the wells being brackish. The most remarkable native buildings are the Temple of Bh\u00e1wan\u00ed, also called the Amba Temple, said to have been built a thousand years ago (and which has supplied a doubtful derivation for the name of Amr\u00e1oti); together with seven other temples, built about a hundred years ago. Amr\u00e1oti is celebrated for its cotton trade, and gives its name to the class of fibre of which it is the entrep\u00f4t. Until the Great Indian Peninsula Railway diverted the business to Bombay, the Amr\u00e1oti cotton was chiefly sent to Mirz\u00e1pur, on the Ganges, upon pack-bullocks. In 1842, a single merchant is said to have despatched 100,000 bullock-loads by this route to Calcutta. Amr\u00e1oti now ranks next to Kh\u00e1mga\u00f3n as a cotton mart, and is the richest town in Ber\u00e1r, with the most numerous and substantial commercial population. In 1880\u201381 the trade by rail of this town was\u2014imports, \u00a3538,247; exports, \u00a3727,951. In 1804, General Wellesley encamped here after the capture of G\u00e1wilgarh. It had then no commercial importance. In 1848, during the Niz\u00e1m\u2019s rule, the price of jo\u00e1r (great millet), the staple food of the people, rose 400 per cent.,\u2014from 10s. to \u00a32 per candy,\u2014owing to the want of rain; and the populace murdered Dhanr\u00e1j Sah\u00fa, a wealthy trader, who had bought up large quantities of rice. Principal public buildings\u2014Court-houses, Commissioner\u2019s and Deputy Commissioner\u2019s offices, jail, lines for police and one company of native infantry, hospital, dispensaries, library and reading-room, church with cemetery, post and telegraph offices, rest-houses for Native and European travellers. Population within municipal limits in 1881, 22,945; municipal taxation, \u00a32988, or 2s. 7\u00bdd. per head; expenditure, \u00a33819. Amr\u00e1oti has one newspaper, the Pramod Sindh\u00fa, and a High School, attended by 99 scholars. In 1877 there were 13 cotton \u2018mills or large manufactories\u2019 in Amr\u00e1oti and the neighbourhood; 1640 \u2018private looms or small works,\u2019 employing in all 5788 cotton-workers, of whom 11 were European superintendents; also, 700 wool looms, 36 silk, and 798 looms for \u2018other fibres,\u2019 employing 12,000 workmen.\n\nAmr\u00e1pur.\u2014Native State in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See UMRAPUR.\n\nAmr\u00e1pur.\u2014Town in Madaksira t\u00e1luk, Anantapur District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 14\u00b0 8' N.; long. 77\u00b0 1' 15\" E.; houses, 936; population (1881) 3165. Formerly called Nad\u00edmepalli, the old site being about half a mile to the west. In the neighbourhood are some fine druapair (cocoa-nut) gardens. Situated on the road from Chitaldr\u00fag to Chitt\u00far. Large weekly market.\n\nAmr\u00e1pur.\u2014Petty State of the P\u00e1ndu Mehw\u00e1s, in Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha, Bombay Presidency. Area, 1\u00be square miles; estimated revenue (1882), \u00a350. Pays a tribute of \u00a320 to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda. The chief village lies in lat. 21\u00b0 36' N., long. 71\u00b0 6' E.\nAmr\u0101vati.\u2014River in Coimbatore and Trichinopoli Districts, Madras Presidency. It has its source in the confluence of several streams that run from the north-eastern spurs of the Anamalai range into the Anjen\u00e1d valley, whence it debouches into Coimbatore District, at the village of Kall\u00e1puram, and, after flowing through the t\u00e1luks of Udumalpetai, Dh\u00e1r\u00e1puram and Kar\u00far, falls into the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery) river at the village of Tir\u00famakudal, on the Trichinopoli boundary. In its course of 122 miles, the Amr\u0101vati is crossed by 16 anicuts and 6 temporary dams, which drain off for the fields so much water, that in ordinary seasons the river is nearly exhausted before it joins the K\u00e1veri (Cauvery). Lat. 10\u00b0 58' N., and long. 78\u00b0 13' 45\" E. The Government revenue in 1881, from the 21,620 acres of wet or rice lands irrigated by this river, amounted to \u00a313,052, or an average rate of about 12s. per acre. Kar\u00far and Dh\u00e1r\u00e1puram are the most important towns on its banks. Navigation is possible only for the smallest class of boats.\n\nAmr\u0101vati (Amara Ishwara, Dharamikotta, sometimes called Dipal Dinna).\u2014Town in the Satnapalli t\u00e1luk, Kistna District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 16\u00b0 34' 45\" N., long. 80\u00b0 24' 21\" E.; population (1881) 2155. Situated on the south bank of the Kistna river, 62 miles from its mouth, 20 miles north-west of Gant\u00far (Guntoor), and close to the site of the ancient Dharamkotta. Of great interest for the antiquary, as one of the chief centres of the Buddhist kingdom of Vengi, and for its tope. The tope was first examined in 1797, when drawings were made; and subsequently portions of the sculptures from the processional circle and daghoba were sent by Sir Walter Elliott to England. Amr\u0101vati has been identified with Hwen Thsang\u2019s To-na-kie-tse-kia, and with the Rahmi of Arab geographers. Subsequent to the disappearance of Buddhism from this region, the town became a centre of the Sivaite faith. When Hwen Thsang visited Amr\u0101vati in 639 A.D., it had already been deserted for a century, but he speaks in glowing terms of its magnificence and beauty. No vestige of the central daghoba now remains in situ, but Mr. Fergusson has ascertained its dimensions and general appearance by piecing together the fragments in the India Museum, London. Very careful and artistic representations of the tope, with its daghoba and interesting rail, pillars, and sculptures, will be found in Mr. Fergusson\u2019s Tree and Serpent Worship, and in his History of India Architecture (ed. 1876). Its elaborate carvings illustrate the life of Buddha, and supply valuable materials for the study of tree and serpent worship in India. See also \u2018Report on the Amr\u0101vati Tope, and Excavations on its Site in 1877,\u2019 by Mr. Robert Sewell.\n\nAmr\u0101vati, or Chati\u00e1, Hill.\u2014Close to the village of Chati\u00e1, in Cuttack District, Bengal. Lat. 26\u00b0 37' N., long. 86\u00b0 5' E. At the\neastern base of the hill are the remains of an old fort, with an extensive rampart made of laterite, 4 feet deep, and said to have been 2 miles square. On a platform within the ramparts are the remains of the fort; and another platform contains two images of the goddess Indr\u00e1n\u00ed, cut out of slate-stone, and remarkable for their elegance and beauty. A spacious tank, called the nil-pukur, covering about 20 acres, is situated within half a mile of the hill, in the centre of which are the ruins of an old building of considerable dimensions.\n\nAmreli.\u2014Division of Baroda State, Guzer\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency, comprising the Districts of Amreli and Okh\u00e1mandal in the peninsula of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r.

A Beng\u00e1l\u00ed weekly newspaper, the Amrit\u00e1 B\u00e1z\u00e1r Patrika, was formerly published here, but is now printed in Calcutta. A sam\u00e1j or theistic congregation was formed here in 1859, and consisted in 1870 of 15 members, but has since ceased to exist, most of the members having joined the Vaishnav sect.\n\nAmritsar.\u2014Division or Commissionership in the Punjab, lying between 31\u00b0 10' and 33\u00b0 50' 30\" N. lat., and between 74\u00b0 14' 45\" and 75\u00b0 44' 30\" E. long., and including the three Districts of AMRITSAR, GURDASPUR, and SIALKOT, each of which see separately. Area of Amritsar Division, 5354 square miles; population (1881) 2,729,109, comprising 1,474,319 Muhammadans, 921,171 Hindus, 328,927 Sikhs, 2867 Christians, and 1825 others.

Amritsar is bounded on the north-west by the river R\u00e1vi, which separates it from Si\u00e1lkot District; on the north-east by the District of Gurd\u00e1spur; on the south-east by the river Be\u00e1s (Bi\u00e1s), which divides it from Kapurth\u00e1la State; and on the south-west by the District of Lahore. The administrative head-quarters are at the town of AMRITSAR.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District of Amritsar is an oblong strip of country extending from side to side of the B\u00e1ri Do\u00e1b, or alluvial tract between the Be\u00e1s and the R\u00e1vi. Though apparently a level plain, it has in reality a gentle slope from east to west, as indicated by the course of its boundary rivers, and by the variations in the water levels. The right bank of the Be\u00e1s is high and abrupt, crowned with a series of bluffs and sand-hills, which occasionally attain an elevation of 60 feet above the stream at their base. From this point the level gradually falls away towards the channel of the R\u00e1vi, whose eastern bank does not exceed a few feet in height. In the neighbourhood of the R\u00e1vi, water may be found at less than 20 feet below the surface, whereas in the higher ground to the eastward it can rarely be reached at a depth of 50 feet. On either river, a belt of kh\u00e1dar, or low-lying silt, fringes the margin of the modern bed, changing year by year, according to the action of the floods. A hundred years ago, the Be\u00e1s is said to have run seven miles from its present course, and traces of its ancient bed are still discernible. At Waz\u00edr Bhola, where the river is crossed by the Punjab and Delhi Railway, and by the Grand Trunk Road, the low water or winter channel varies from 300 to 400 feet in width, but swells in flood time to three-quarters of a mile. The stream, a seething torrent during the rains, and 35 feet deep, dwindles in the winter to a mean depth of perhaps 6 feet, and is even fordable in places. A fine railway bridge spans the river at Waz\u00edr Bhola, and ferries are maintained at 11 other places. The R\u00e1vi is fordable everywhere during the winter and spring months, but in the rainy seasons the depth is from 18 to 20 feet, and ferries are kept up at the principal crossing places. At Kakkar, on the Amritsar and\nGujr\u00e1nw\u00e1la road, a bridge of boats is maintained across the river, except during the four months of flood. Between the great boundary streams, several lines of drainage enter Amritsar from Gurd\u00e1spur, and after heavy rains bring down a considerable volume of water, collected from the high grounds of that District. Of these, the most important is the Kirran or Sakki. The soil of Amritsar consists mainly of alluvial clay and loam, usually good and cultivable, though interspersed with patches of barren sand, or tracts of the deleterious saline efflorescence known as kalar. The District includes several strips of waste land, known as rakhs, more or less covered with inferior timber-trees and coarse grass, some of which are under the charge of the Forest Department, while others are preserved for the sake of fodder alone. These rakhs were more numerous, and of far greater extent, twenty years ago than at present. Cultivation has rapidly increased, and large grants of waste land have been made to native officers of the army, the country around Amritsar and Lahore, known as the m\u00e1njha, having ever been the great recruiting ground, where retired soldiers endeavour, if possible, to obtain a grant of land in the neighbourhood of their homes. Apart from the rakhs, the scarcity of trees, particularly in the south, is a marked feature of the District. What trees there are, have been planted in the neighbourhood of villages or on the borders of fields. The only characteristic trees indigenous to Amritsar are the phul\u00e1hi (Acacia modesta), far\u00e1sh (Tamarix orientalis), dh\u00e1k (Butea frondosa), and jh\u00e1nd (Prosopis spicigera). The last-named species is a gnarled and knotted bush, highly valued for fuel. Many other fruit-bearing or forest trees have been successfully introduced of late years. The District has no mineral produce except kankar, or nodulated limestone, deposited in layers a few feet below the surface, and largely used for road-metalling and the manufacture of lime. Salt was formerly obtained from the saline earth of the kalar plains by evaporation, but this industry is now practically extinct, owing to the superior supply obtained from the mines of Jhelum District. Amritsar is not, on the whole, a good District for sport, although the southern half is well stocked with the common antelope and chik\u00e1ra (ravine deer); and black-buck stalking is obtainable. Wild pigs are found occasionally in the rakhs or fuel plantations. Wolves are the only beasts of prey. The feathered game comprise the black and grey partridge, sand-grouse, pea-fowl, quail, ortolan, wild duck and geese, snipe, crane, ibis, and curlew. In the Be\u00e1s river the mahsir affords excellent fishing; but in the R\u00e1vi this fish, although numerous, is said to refuse the bait. Such statements must, however, be received with hesitation; as in similar cases which have been investigated by experts, the fish are always found to be ready to take some particular form of bait, if sufficiently fine tackle be employed. In\nboth rivers, the large *rahi* (the *ruhi* of Bengal) is caught for sale by native fishermen.\n\n**History.**\u2014Amritsar contains no noteworthy relics of an early date, and the interest of its local annals begins with the rise of the Sikh power. The *guru* or high priest, Angad, successor to N\u00e1nak, founder of their sect, inhabited the village of Khad\u00far, near the Be\u00e1s, in the south of this District, where he died in 1552. Amar D\u00e1s, third *guru*, lived at Govindw\u00e1l in the same neighbourhood, and was succeeded on his death in 1574 by his son-in-law R\u00e1m D\u00e1s, who became the fourth spiritual leader of the rising sect, and died in 1581. R\u00e1m D\u00e1s laid the foundations of the future city of Amritsar upon a site granted by the Emperor Akbar. He also excavated the holy tank from which the town derives its name of *Amrita Saras*, or Pool of Immortality; and in its midst, on a small island, he began to erect a temple, the future centre of Sikh devotion. Arjan, the fifth *guru*, son and successor of R\u00e1m D\u00e1s, completed the sacred building, and lived to see the growth of a flourishing town around the holy site. In spite of persecution, the sect rapidly increased in numbers and importance; but Arjan, having become involved in a quarrel with the imperial governor of Lahore, died a prisoner at that city in 1606. Under his son, Har Govind, the Sikhs first offered resistance to the imperial power. The *guru* defeated a force sent against him; but was ultimately obliged to leave the Punjab, and died an exile in 1644\u201345. Guru Govind, the tenth spiritual chief in succession to N\u00e1nak, organized the Sikhs into a religious-military commonwealth; in which all men were equal, and all were soldiers. In 1708, Banda, the chosen friend and disciple of Govind, the last of the *gurus*, returned to Amritsar, and preached a religious war against the Muhammadans. Henceforth the character of the Sikh resistance entirely changed. Amritsar was the centre of a constant struggle, waged with varying fortune by the Sikhs, at first against the imperial governors of Lahore, and afterwards against Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Dur\u00e1ni. Time after time, the Musalm\u00e1ns succeeded in capturing their capital; but after each defeat the enthusiasm of the young faith rose again with unabated vigour. The last great disaster of the Sikhs was in 1761, when Ahmad Sh\u00e1h routed their forces completely at the second great historical battle of P\u00e1n\u00edpat, near Delhi, and pursued them across the Sutlej (Satlej). On his homeward march he destroyed the town of Amritsar, blew up the temple with gunpowder, filled in the sacred tank with mud, and defiled the holy place by the slaughter of cows. But, true to their faith, the Sikhs rose once more as their conqueror withdrew, and this time initiated a final struggle, which resulted in the secure establishment of their independence. The desecrated shrine was restored, and Amritsar became for a while the capital of the Province. Each of the Sikh Confederacies\nhad its own quarters in the city. In the division of their territory, the greater part of Amritsar District fell to the chiefs of the Bhang\u00ed Confederacy. Gradually, however, Ranjit Singh, who obtained possession of Lahore in 1799, brought the whole surrounding country under his own sway. The Bhang\u00ed chieftains succumbed in 1802, and before long the whole District was included in the dominions of the Lahore prince. With the remainder of the Punjab, it came under British rule after the second Sikh war, in 1849. As originally formed, the Amritsar District included the Sub-division of N\u00e1row\u00e1l, transferred to Si\u00e1lkot in 1867; and other redistributions of territory have also taken place from time to time. On the outbreak of the Mutiny in May 1857, great anxiety was felt for the safety of the Govindgarh fortress, just outside the walls of Amritsar. It was garrisoned mainly by native troops of suspected regiments, and a few artillerymen were the only Europeans on the spot. The city, on the other hand, remained quiet, and the peasantry evinced a loyal readiness to aid the local authorities in case of need. The danger was at length averted by the timely despatch in carriages of a company of British infantry from Meean Meer (Mi\u00e1n M\u00edr).\n\n**Population.**\u2014An enumeration of the population in 1855 returned the total number of the inhabitants in the tract now composing Amritsar District at 720,374. The Census of 1868 returned the number at 832,838, and that of 1881 at 893,266 persons. The latter enumeration was effected over an area of 1574 square miles, and gave the following results:\u2014Total population, 893,266; number of villages and towns, 1039; number of houses, 156,492, of which 121,155 were occupied, and 35,337 unoccupied. From these data the following averages may be deduced:\u2014Persons per square mile, 567; villages per square mile, .66; persons per town or village, 860; houses per square mile, 99; persons per occupied house, 7.37. Classified according to sex, there were\u2014males, 490,694; females, 402,572; proportion of males, 54.9 per cent. Classified according to age, there were\u2014under 15 years, males, 181,119; females, 144,521: total, 325,640, or 36.45 per cent.;\u2014above 15 years, males, 309,575; females, 258,051: total, 567,626, or 63.55 per cent. As regards the religious distinctions of the people, Muhammadans numbered 413,207; Hindus, 262,531; Sikhs, 216,337; Christians, 869; Jains, 312; and others, 10. The principal tribes of the District include 205,434 J\u00e1ts (of whom 16,843 are returned as Hindus, 151,107 as Sikhs, and 37,483 as Muhammadans); 32,495 Kashmir\u00eds, exclusively Muhammadans; 34,753 Br\u00e1hmans, namely, Hindus 34,120, and Sikhs 633; R\u00e1jputs, 27,665, namely, Hindus 1818, Sikhs 450, and Muhammadans 25,391; Khattris, 31,411, namely, Hindus 29,036, and Sikhs 2375; and Aroras, 20,613, namely, Hindus 14,771, and Sikhs 5842. The J\u00e1ts constitute 55.7 per cent. of the agricultural population. The Sikh J\u00e1ts in this and the neighbouring\nDistricts formed the flower of the armies which contested the fields of Moodkee (Mudki), Ferozsh\u00e1h, and Sobr\u00e1on with the British troops, and ventured again to face them in a second campaign. They are a peasantry of which any country in the world might be proud, admirable as soldiers in time of war, and equally admirable in peace for their skill and perseverance as agriculturists. The Kashm\u00edris are exclusively Muhammadans, and reside in the city of Amritsar, where they carry on their manufacture of the famous Amritsar shawls. Slight in person and uncleanly in their habits, they bear a bad reputation for trickery and litigiousness. Large numbers of the Br\u00e1hmans are engaged in agriculture, while others find employment as domestic servants. The Khattris and Aroras form the trading classes of the towns and villages. R\u00e1jputs are found as agriculturists only in the low-lying lands bordering upon the R\u00e1vi and the Be\u00e1s; most of them follow miscellaneous occupations in the city of Amritsar. The other classes of the District are made up as follow:\u2014Ch\u00fahra, 107,011 (Hindus 102,242, Sikhs 2351, and Muhammadans 2415); Jh\u00ednwar, 45,360 (Hindus 16,236, Sikhs 5554, Muhammadans 23,570); Tarkh\u00e1n, 34,984 (Hindus 4101, Sikhs 21,095, Muhammadans 9788); Kumbhar, 29,175 (Hindus 6156, Sikhs 2429, Muhammadans 20,590); Loh\u00e1r, 18,778 (Hindus 1039, Sikhs 4769, Muhammadans 12,970); N\u00e1i, 14,694 (Hindus 4834, Sikhs 3447, Musalm\u00e1ns 6404); Kamboh, 13,654 (Hindus 2844, Sikhs 6814, Muhammadans 3996); Chhimba, 13,379 (Hindus 3273, Sikhs 3956, Muhammadans 6150); Mir\u00e1sis, 11,046 (all but 90 being Muhammadans); Son\u00e1r, 8605 (Hindus 5085, Sikhs 2860, Muhammadans 660). The exclusively Muhammadan tribes are\u2014Shaikh 8280, Sayyid 5003, Path\u00e1n 4349, Ar\u00e1in 44,708, Julaha 41,593, Barw\u00e1la 13,180, Bharai 6157, Chang\u00e1r 4712, and G\u00fajar 4168. Classified according to sect, the Muhammadans were returned as follows:\u2014Sunn\u00eds, 409,092; Shi\u00e1s, 1543; Wah\u00e1b\u00eds, 541; Far\u00e1iz\u00eds, 28; and unspecified, 2003. Of the total Christian population, 562 were returned as Europeans, 66 as Eurasians, and 241 as natives. By sect, the Christian population consisted of\u2014Church of England, 533; Roman Catholics, 175; Presbyterians, 46; Baptists, 39; others and unspecified, 76.\n\nThe eight most important towns are\u2014Amritsar (151,896), Jandiala (6535), Majitha (6053), Ramdas (4498), Tarn Taran (3210), Vairowal (5409), Sarhali Kalan (5197), and Bundala (5101), of which the first-named six are municipalities. Amritsar, the administrative head-quarters of the District, is second in size to Delhi alone amongst the cities of the Province, and inferior to none in political importance. It is the sacred city of the Sikhs, and the centre of their religious aspirations. No other town in the District can lay claim to more than local importance. Of the 1039 villages and towns, 172 are returned as containing in 1881 less than 200 inhabitants; 337\nfrom 200 to 500; 304 from 500 to 1000; 175 from 1000 to 2000; 27 from 2000 to 3000; 18 from 3000 to 5000; 5 from 5000 to 10,000; and 1 of over 50,000. The principal fairs are the Diw\u00e1li held at Amritsar in November, and the B\u00e1is\u00e1khi in April. They are primarily of a religious character; but of late years horse and cattle fairs have been held at the same time, at which large transactions take place, and prizes are given by Government. The chief other religious gatherings are two large fairs held at Tarn T\u00e1ran in March and August; one in November at R\u00e1m\u00edtirth, a place of Hindu pilgrimage 8 miles north-west of Amritsar city; at Govindw\u00e1l, Dera N\u00e1nak, Khad\u00far, and other Sikh shrines. As regards occupation, the Census Report of 1881 divides the adult male population into the following seven classes:\u2014(1) Professional, including civil, military, and the learned professions, 16,568; (2) domestic service, 29,069; (3) commercial, including merchants, traders, and carriers, 5807; (4) agricultural and pastoral, 114,728; (5) industrial, including manufacturers, artisans, etc., 93,008; (6) indefinite and non-productive, 22,476; (7) occupations not specified, 27,919.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Only a small proportion of the soil is unfit for tillage, and a considerable area receives irrigation from the B\u00e1ri Do\u00e1b Canal, which draws its supplies from the R\u00e1vi in Gurd\u00e1spur District. Amritsar is traversed both by the main canal and by a branch which passes westwards towards Lahore. In a great part of the District, wells are also in use for irrigation, either independently or as supplementary to the canals. Cultivation has been largely extended of late years under the security of British rule. In 1851 there were 149,483 acres of irrigated land, and a total of 596,748 acres under cultivation; in 1864 the irrigated area had risen to 179,914 acres, and the total extent of cultivation to 633,080 acres; in 1880\u201381 the irrigated area had further increased to 242,903 acres, and the total extent of cultivation to 766,773 acres. Area irrigated from Government canals, 97,256 acres; by private irrigation, 145,647 acres. A large proportion of the tillage is thus protected against drought by artificial means. The staple products of the rabi, or spring harvest, are wheat, barley, and gram. Mustard, flax, lentils, safflower, and lucerne grass for fodder are also cultivated, together with small quantities of poppy and tobacco. For the kharif, or autumn harvest, rice, Indian corn, jo\u00e1r, pulses, cotton, and sugar-cane are the all-important crops. The grain is principally grown for home consumption, while sugar and cotton form the staples of the export trade. In 1880\u201381 the acreage of the principal crops was returned as follows:\u2014Wheat, 297,032 acres; rice, 24,747; makai or Indian corn, 51,499; jo\u00e1r or great millet, 52,501; barley, 41,578; other cereals, 13,045; gram, 100,061; other pulses, such as moth, matar, m\u00e1sh, mung, mas\u00far, 30,390; poppy, 560; tobacco, 1966; chillies, 891; coriander seed, 37; oil-seeds, 9595; cotton, 16,347;\nhemp, 1407; vegetables, 14,369; sugar-cane, 33,085 acres. Wheat and barley for the spring harvest are ordinarily sown in September or October, and reaped in March or April. For gram, the seasons both of sowing and reaping are a little earlier. The preparation for the autumn harvest is begun with the commencement of the rainy season, and sowing ought to be completed before the middle of August. The average out-turn of the principal crops per acre was returned as follows in 1880-81:\u2014Wheat, 738 lbs.; rice, 960 lbs.; inferior grains, 480 lbs.; gram, 530 lbs.; oil-seeds, 320 lbs.; fibres, 380 lbs. The estimated available agricultural stock in the District is shown as under:\u2014Cows and bullocks, 174,056; horses, 1443; ponies, 1475; donkeys, 6098; sheep and goats, 47,214; pigs, 50; camels, 311; carts, 1875; ploughs, 56,129. The soil is the property of village communities, held subject to the payment of a land tax to the State. Out of 1077 villages, in 1873-74, only 59 retained the whole of their land in common; amongst the remainder, the division of land in accordance with the shares of the co-parceners has been carried out with greater or less completeness. Villages in which no undivided common land remains are exceptional. The whole village is in any case responsible to the Government for the land tax assessed upon it. The number of sharers in 1873-74 was returned at 87,804, and the gross area at 1,214,716 acres; allowing for each proprietor, including land let to tenants, an average holding of 13\u00b78 acres. The tenants of the District in the same year were thus classified: Occupancy tenants, 15,411; average holding, 5 acres; tenants holding conditionally, 1186; average holding, 3 acres; tenants-at-will, 32,447; average holding, 4 acres. Most of the occupancy tenants pay rent in the form of a percentage upon the land tax falling to their holdings. With this exception, rent is taken almost universally in kind. The estimated agricultural population is returned at 368,502, or 41\u00b73 per cent. of the District population, of whom 114,728 are males above 15 years of age. Average area of cultivated and cultivable land, 2\u00b74 acres per head of the agricultural population. These figures, however, include only agriculturists pure and simple, and are exclusive of the considerable number who combine agriculture with other occupations, and also of those who depend indirectly in great measure for their livelihood on agriculture. Of the total area of 1574 square miles, 1225 are assessed for Government revenue, of which 983 square miles are cultivated, 128 cultivable, the remainder being uncultivable waste. Amount of Government land revenue, including local rates and cesses on the land, \u00a3100,034, or 3s. per acre of cultivated land; estimated amount of rent actually paid by the cultivators, \u00a3236,830, or an average of 6s. 6d. per cultivated acre. Cash wages in 1880 ruled as follows:\u2014Unskilled labourers, from 3\u00bed. to 4\u00bdd. per diem; skilled labourers, from 9d. to 1s. per diem. Agricultural labourers are paid in kind at the rate of 2\u00bd lbs. of grain per diem; but\nwhen reaping they receive a measure (bh\u00e1ri) containing 32 lbs. of grain; and when husking, 5 per cent. of the produce. These landless day-labourers form about five per cent. of the District population, and when not engaged in field labour, earn their livelihood by handicrafts, chiefly basket-making. The following were the prices current per cwt. of food-grains and principal products in 1880-81:\u2014Wheat (best), 6s. 9\u00bdd. per cwt.; flour (best), 7s. 4d.; barley, 4s. 8d.; best gram, 5s. 8d.; Indian corn, 5s. 1d.; jo\u00e1r, 5s. 1d.; b\u00e1jra, 6s. 3d.; best rice, 8s. 1\u00bdd.; cotton, \u00a32, 4s. 9d.; sugar (refined), \u00a32, 4s. 9d.; tobacco, 12s. 9d. per cwt.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014The north and west of the District are comparatively secure from drought, through the abundant facilities for irrigation which exist in that tract; but in the south-eastern parg\u00e1n\u00e1s, which are higher and more sandy, there must always be risk from the abnormally dry seasons. In 1861, and again in 1869, the failure of the rains rendered necessary the opening of relief works. On both occasions the high price of food caused great distress in the city of Amritsar, to which the indigent peasantry from the neighbouring Districts were attracted in thousands by its reputed wealth. The District as a whole did not suffer materially from the scarcity, and the peasants of the irrigated portions secured large profits from their crops. On January the 1st, 1870, wheat was sold at 9\u00bd sers per rupee, or 11s. 9\u00bdd. per cwt.; gram, at 13\u00be sers per rupee, or 8s. 2d. per cwt.; and Indian corn, at 17\u00bc sers per rupee, or 6s. 4d. per cwt.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014As a commercial centre, Amritsar takes precedence of every town in the Punjab, with the exception of Delhi. Its imports are estimated at an average value of \u00a32,500,000, and its exports at \u00a31,500,000. Bokh\u00e1ra, K\u00e1b\u00fal, and Kashm\u00edr to the west and north, and R\u00e1jput\u00e1na on the south, supply its markets with their produce, and largely depend upon it for the purchase of their Indian and European wares. It is also the great emporium for the home traffic of the Punjab proper, gathering local products of every kind for exportation, and supplying half the merchants of the Province with English piece-goods or other imports from Calcutta and Bombay. The principal items of the Indian trade are grain, sugar, oil-seeds, salt, tobacco, tea, cotton, silk, wool, metals, and leather. The sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 of the city is the manufacture of shawls from the fine woollen undergrowth of the goats found on the high plateau of Tibet. (See AMRITSAR CITY.) Important horse and cattle fairs are held on the chief festivals. The local trade centres so entirely within the city, that the smaller towns are thrown completely into the shade. Jandi\u00e1la, R\u00e1md\u00e1s, Maj\u00edtha, Tarn T\u00e1ran, and Vairow\u00e1l are, however, local marts of some importance. The Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway traverses the heart of the District, with stations at Waz\u00edr Bhola, Jandi\u00e1la, Amritsar, Kh\u00e1sa, and At\u00e1ri. There\nare two good metalled roads; the Grand Trunk line, which enters the District from Jullundur by a ferry across the Sutlej (Satlej), and passes on to Lahore, through Amritsar; and the road from Amritsar to Path\u00e1nkot, in Gurd\u00e1spur, at the foot of the Him\u00e1layas. The total mileage of communications in 1881 was thus returned: Railways, 61 miles; metalled roads, 76 miles; unmetalled roads, 288 miles; navigable rivers, 41 miles. There is a Government line of telegraph by the side of the Grand Trunk road, with a station at Amritsar. The railway line of telegraph is also open to the public. There are five vernacular printing-presses in Amritsar, and one missionary newspaper.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The revenue derived from the District in 1875\u201376 was \u00a3107,196, of which the land tax contributed \u00a383,921, or nearly four-fifths. The land tax was summarily assessed in 1849\u201350 at \u00a386,197, but reductions were afterwards found necessary, and granted accordingly. In 1880\u201381, while the total revenue derived from the District had increased to \u00a3127,862, the amount contributed by the land tax had fallen to \u00a379,359. The administration is carried on by 13 civil and revenue officers, who exercise both judicial and magisterial powers. The staff usually includes 3 covenanted civilians. In 1880\u201381, there were 15 civil and revenue judges, and 14 magisterial officers at work in the District. In the same year, the regular District police numbered 412 men, besides a municipal police of 496, and 5 cantonment police. There is also a body of village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), whose number, however, is not on record. The District jail at Amritsar contained in 1880 a total number of 2950 prisoners of all classes; daily average prison population, 431, of whom 19 were females. Education has made great progress in this District. In 1880\u201381 the returns show 134 schools supported or aided by the State, having a total roll of 7147 pupils. A normal school for teachers was established here in 1865 by the Christian Vernacular Education Society, and nearly 300 men have been trained in the institution. There is also a model school capable of receiving 100 boys. There is no complete official record of the number of private and unaided schools; but the indigenous schools (unaided) number at least 256 with 3719 pupils. The Census report of 1881 returned a total of 8656 boys as under instruction, and 24,869 other males as able to read and write. The principal educational establishments are a female normal school, the higher and middle departments of the District school, and the various mission schools in receipt of grants-in-aid. Female instruction has received considerable attention in Amritsar, 1320 of the scholars in 1880 being girls. The Census, however, only returned 450 girls as under instruction. For administrative purposes the District is divided into 3 tahsils, namely, AMRITSAR, AJNALA, and TARN TARAN, and 23 pargan\u00e1s. The aggregate revenue of the six municipal towns amounted,\nin 1880-81, to \u00a332,607; while their united expenditure reached a total of \u00a332,020.\n\nSanitary Aspects.\u2014The climate of Amritsar is considered more temperate in the summer months than that of many other places in the Punjab; and this fact is doubtless due to the comparative proximity of the hills, joined with the general extension of tillage and irrigation. During the winter months the atmosphere is pleasant and healthy, and frosts are frequent. The annual average rainfall for the 21 years ending 1880 amounted to 26.3 inches. In 1880, the rainfall was considerably below the average, and only 19.1 inches fell, distributed as follows:\u2014January to May, 1.9 inch; June to September, 16.4 inches; October to December, 0.8 inch. The mean temperature in the shade in May 1880 was 91.1\u00b0 Fahr.; in July, 85.2\u00b0; in December, 55.6\u00b0. The highest reading in 1881 was 113\u00b0 in May; and the minimum 36.5\u00b0 in December. The total number of deaths officially recorded in the District during 1880 was 23,914, being at the rate of 26.78 per thousand of the population. No less than 14,621, or more than one-half of the registered deaths, are due to fevers. Amritsar District contains a civil hospital, with two branch dispensaries, and a midwifery school in Amritsar city; and dispensaries at Tarn T\u00e1ran, Ajn\u00e1la, Maj\u00edtha, and At\u00e1ri, which afforded medical assistance in 1880 to 71,147 patients. At Tarn T\u00e1ran there is a leper asylum, the largest in the Punjab, with a total of 352 inmates in 1880. [For further details, see the Amritsar District Gazetteer, by D. J. H. Ibbetson, Esq., C.S.; the Punjab Census Report for 1881; the Punjab Provincial Administration Reports, 1881 to 1883; the Report on the Revised Settlement of Sialkot District in the Amritsar Division, by E. A. Prinsep, Esq., C.S., 1863.]\n\nAmritsar.\u2014Tahsil of Amritsar District, Punjab; situated in the middle of the B\u00e1ri Do\u00e1b plain, between 31\u00b0 28' 15\" and 31\u00b0 51' N. lat., and between 74\u00b0 44' 30\" and 75\u00b0 26' 15\" E. long., and deriving its name from the city of Amritsar, which lies within its boundaries. Area, 550 square miles; population (1881) 430,418; namely, Muhammadans, 191,830; Hindus, 149,279; Sikhs, 88,125; and Christians and others, 1184. Amritsar tahsil comprises the following nine fiscal divisions (t\u00e1lukas or pargan\u00e1s)\u2014Jandi\u00e1la, Sathi\u00e1la, Bund\u00e1la, Maht\u00e1bkot, Mattiw\u00e1l, Chawinda, Maj\u00edtha, Amritsar, and Gilw\u00e1li. The administrative staff consists of the Commissioner of the Division, the Deputy-Commissioner of the District, Judicial Assistant, four Assistant Commissioners, one tahsild\u00e1r, three munisifs, and one honorary Magistrate. These officers preside over twelve civil and nine criminal courts, with five police stations, 572 regular police, and 414 village watchmen. The land revenue of the tahsil is \u00a339,377.\n\nAmritsar.\u2014City in Amritsar District, Punjab, and the head-quarters\nof the Division; situated 32 miles east of Lahore city, in a depression of the B\u0101ri Do\u00e1b, midway between the Be\u00e1s and R\u00e1vi rivers. Lat. $31^\\circ 37' 15''$ N., long. $74^\\circ 55' E$. Population (1881) 151,896. Next to Delhi, Amritsar is the wealthiest and most populous city of the Punjab, and the religious capital of the Sikhs. The city was founded in 1574 by Guru R\u00e1m D\u00e1s, the apostle of the Sikhs, upon a site granted by the Emperor Akbar, around a sacred tank, from which the city takes its name. A temple was erected in the centre of the t\u00e1luk, and Amritsar (literally 'The Pool of Immortality') became the capital of the rising sect. Another account mentions that an ancient city, Chak, formed the nucleus of the Sikh saints' capital. Ahmad Sh\u00e1h destroyed the town in 1761, blew up the temple, and defiled the shrines with bullocks' blood. After his retirement in the succeeding year, the Sikh community assumed political independence, and Amritsar was divided between the various chiefs, each of whom possessed a separate ward as his private estate. The city gradually passed, however, into the power of the Bhang\u00ed Confederacy, who retained the supremacy until 1802. In that year R\u00e1njit Singh seized Amritsar, and incorporated it with his dominions. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 spent large sums of money upon the great shrine, and roofed it with sheets of copper gilt, whence the building derives its popular name of the Golden Temple. He also erected the fortress of Govindgarh, to the north-west of the city, nominally for the protection of the pilgrims, but in reality to overawe their tumultuous assemblages. Part of the massive wall with which he surrounded Amritsar still remains, but the greater portion has been demolished since the British occupation. The present city is handsome and well-built, its oldest portions dating back only to the year 1762, while the greater part is of very recent erection. Near the centre lies the sacred tank, from whose midst rises the Darb\u00e1r S\u00e1hib, or great temple of the Sikh faith, the focus of the believer's aspirations. It stands upon a rectangular platform, connected with the land by a marble causeway, and consists of a square block surmounted by a gilded dome. Many of the inlaid decorations had been carried off by the Sikh marauders from the tomb of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr and other Muhammadan monuments. The service at the Golden Temple consists of the reading of the Granth, or sacred book of the Sikhs, with hymns and a musical accompaniment. It is of an impressive character, and daily attracts throngs of the faithful. The city contains several minor tanks and temples, besides a lofty column, known as the B\u00e1ba Atal, built over the tomb of a son of Guru Har Govind. A short distance north-west of the modern wall stands the fort of Govindgarh, built by Ranjit Singh in 1809, and now garrisoned by a company of British infantry with a battery of artillery. North of the city are the civil lines, and beyond them the military cantonment, occupied by two companies of native infantry. The Sind, Punjab, and\nDelhi Railway has a handsome station half a mile north of the city. The chief public buildings are the court-houses and treasury, the Protestant and Roman Catholic churches, post-office, telegraph office, police station, jail, hospital, and Government school-house, and the Municipal Town Hall. Two great religious fairs are held in Amritsar during the months of November and April. Besides its political importance as the sacred city of the Sikh faith, Amritsar forms the head-quarters of several heterodox or fanatical sects.\n\nAmritsar is the most flourishing commercial city of the Punjab, and it has become the great entrep\u00f4t and starting-place for the trans-Him\u00e1layan traffic. The value of the imports into Amritsar in 1879-80 amounted to \u00a32,422,337, and in 1880-81 to \u00a33,153,428; exports in 1879-80, \u00a3933,765, and in 1880-81, \u00a31,303,098. Total trade in 1879-80, \u00a33,356,102; in 1880-81, \u00a34,456,526. The great increase of imports was in wheat, gram, rice, salt, and refined sugar; and of exports, in wheat, hides, and skins. Trade is carried on with Bokh\u00e1ra, K\u00e1b\u00fal, and Kashmir on the north, and with Calcutta, Bombay, and the other Indian seats of commerce southward. There is, however, some probability that, since the opening of the railway to Pesh\u00e1war in 1883, the Central Asian traders may begin to deal directly with Bombay and Calcutta. The principal imports are grain, pulses, sugar, oil, salt, tobacco, cotton, English piece-goods, Kashmir shawls, silk, glass, earthenware, hardware, tea, and dye-stuffs. The exports are chiefly the same articles, passed through in transit; together with the manufactures of the town, which consist mainly of woollen fabrics and silks. The sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 of the city is the manufacture of shawls from the fine undergrowth of the goats (pashm) on the plateau of Tibet. The pattern of the best shawls is produced on the loom; the common kinds are woven of a single ground shade, and afterwards embroidered in colours. The looms employed number about 4000. The workers are Kashmir\u00eds, whose first settlement took place about the year 1803. Besides the shawls of home manufacture, Amritsar forms the chief mart for the genuine fabrics of Kashmir. Several European firms have agents in the city to make their purchases; and the total annual value of shawls exported to Europe is stated at \u00a3200,000, of which the local manufacture contributes \u00a380,000. I take these statements from official sources, but I have been informed that, owing to the decreased demand in Europe for Kashmir shawls, this branch of trade in Amritsar is declining. A full-sized shawl of the best quality will fetch from \u00a340 to \u00a350 on the spot; smaller sizes range in price from \u00a312 to \u00a330. The manufacture, which requires the utmost skill in manipulation, is learned by the workmen from their earliest childhood. The Amritsar fabric, however, is inferior to that of Kashmir, owing among other causes to the adulteration of the wool, which practice is never allowed\nin Kashmir. The other principal items of manufacture are woollen cloth, silk goods, and gold thread embroidery. Important horse and cattle fairs are held on the two great religious festivals.\n\nThe city is steadily increasing in population. In 1868 the inhabitants were returned at 135,813; while at the time of the Census of 1881 they had risen to 151,896, made up of 75,891 Muhammadans, 61,274 Hindus, 13,876 Sikhs, 9 Jains, and 846 'others,' mainly Christians. Males, 86,714; females, 65,182. The city contains 26,346 occupied houses; average persons per inhabited house, 5'7'.\n\nThe site of Amritsar is very flat, and its drainage difficult to effect. The water supply is obtained from wells, in which impurities commonly occur. Hence Amritsar suffers much from any epidemic which visits the Punjab; and cholera, fever, diarrhoea, and dysentery are very prevalent. An extensive scheme of drainage is now (1883), however, in course of construction, and other sanitary and conservancy measures are being carried out with a view to raising the standard of health of the city. The civic administration of Amritsar is conducted by a municipality of the first class. Municipal income in 1880-81, \u00a330,544; expenditure, \u00a331,070.\n\nAmroha.\u2014Tahsil of Moradabad District, North-Western Provinces; consisting of a level plain traversed by the Ban, Kurala, and Ganguru streams, and bounded on the east by the Ramganga river. The Sot (or Yar-i-Wafadar) flows southward for a few miles from its source in a swamp near Amroha town. Area, 383 square miles, of which 264 are under cultivation; number of villages, 498; land revenue, \u00a313,300; total revenue, \u00a314,202; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a358,228. The tahsil contains one civil and one criminal court, with two police stations (thanas). The regular and municipal police number 64; and the village police (chaukidars), 472 men.\n\nAmroha.\u2014Ancient town and municipality in Moradabad District, North-Western Provinces; 23 miles north-west of Moradabad, by road; frequently mentioned by the Musalm\u00e1n historians. Lat. 28\u00b0 54' 40\" N., long. 78\u00b0 31' 5\" E.; population (1881) 36,145, comprising 10,644 Hindus, 25,377 Muhammadans, 97 Jains, 20 Christians, and 7 'others.' Area of town site, 397 acres. Contains a tank, and tomb of Shaikh Saddu. The affairs of the town are managed by a committee of 9 members, 3 of whom are officials, and 6 elected; municipal income in 1880-81, \u00a31462, of which \u00a31416 was derived from octroi; expenditure, \u00a31460; average incidence of taxation, 9\u00bdd. per head of population.\n\nAmsin.\u2014Pargana in Faizabad (Fyzabad) District, Oudh; bounded on the north by the river Sarju or Gogra, on the east by Tanda pargana, on the south by the Madha river, and on the west by Haweli Oudh, and Pachhimrath parganas. The aboriginal Bhars have left many ruins\nin this pargan\u00e1; they themselves have disappeared. The ancient Hindu clans still represented in the pargan\u00e1 are the Barw\u00e1r and Raikw\u00e1r Kshattriyas, who came to the country about 300 years ago. The former were at one time powerful, but their villages have within the last thirty years passed into the hands of others. Of the 180 villages comprising the pargan\u00e1, 79 are included in the estate held by the late Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 M\u00e1n Singh, a Br\u00e1hman; the Gargbans\u00eds hold 44; Musalm\u00e1ns, 21, etc. These estates were all formed in the present century. To the old landed families of Barw\u00e1rs and Raikw\u00e1rs only 6 villages remain of their ancient estates. The tillage is very good. Irrigation is largely resorted to. Area, 99 square miles, of which 63 square miles are cultivated and 14 square miles cultivable but not under tillage. Population in 1881: Hindus, 53,878; Muhammadans, 5471; others, 29: total, 59,378. The Br\u00e1hmans are the most numerous section of the population; and, next to them, the Kshattriyas or R\u00e1jputs. Markets are held in 10 villages. The Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway runs through the pargan\u00e1.\n\nAmsin.\u2014Town in Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Oudh, and head-quarters of Amsin pargan\u00e1. Population (1881) 1308, consisting of 901 Hindus and 407 Muhammadans; houses, 496.\n\nAmura Bhauriari (Amwa Byria).\u2014A village in Champ\u00e1ran District, Bengal. Lat. 26\u00b0 47' N., long. 84\u00b0 19' E.\n\nAmurn\u00e1th.\u2014Cave in Kashmir State, Punjab.\u2014See Amarnath.\n\nAmw\u00e1.\u2014Collection of villages in Gorakhpur District, North-Western Provinces, 68 miles from Gorakhpur town. Lat. 26\u00b0 51' N., long. 84\u00b0 16' 15\" E. The population consists chiefly of agriculturists belonging to low Hindu castes. The Bur\u00ed Gandak, on whose bank Amw\u00e1 formerly stood, has now changed its course and flows some miles to the east; but the alluvial tract between the village and the river is still subject to occasional fertilising floods.\n\nAn, or Aeng.\u2014River in Kyauk-py\u00fa (Kyouk-hpyoo) District, Arakan Division, British Burma; rises in the Arakan Yoma Mountains, and flows by a south-westerly course into Combermere Bay. Navigable by large boats 45 miles from its mouth during spring tides.\n\nAn, or Aeng.\u2014Township in Kyauk-py\u00fa (Kyouk-hpyoo) District, British Burma. Area, 2883 square miles; population (1881) 20,658. It consists of a hilly and densely-wooded country, entirely occupying the eastern portion of Kyauk-py\u00fa north of the Ma\u00ed (Maee) river, and bounded by the Arakan Yoma mountains. The chief rivers are the An and the Ma\u00ed (Maee). Large quantities of rice, tobacco, and sesamum are raised for exportation in the river valleys near the seacoast. From Upper Burma, via the An Pass, are imported ponies, tea, coarse sugar, lacquered ware, and other articles. Gross revenue (1881) \u00a32950. Area under cultivation (1881-82), rice, 10,627 acres; and\nmiscellaneous, 296 acres;\u2014agricultural stock: horned cattle, 4369; pigs, 2630; ploughs, 1094; and boats, 781. Before 1826, An formed a Burmese Governorship; after our conquest it was united with Sandoway, and in 1833 was erected into a separate District, with portions of the present Kyauk-py\u00fa and Akyab Districts joined to it. In 1838, the head-quarters were removed from An to Kyauk-py\u00fa, and 11 circles were added to it from Ramri (Ramree) District. In 1852, Ramri and An were united into Kyauk-py\u00fa District.\n\nAn, or Aeng.\u2014Town and head-quarters of An township, Kyauk-py\u00fa (Kyouk-hpyoo) District, British Burma; situated in lat. 19\u00b0 49' 30\" N., and long. 94\u00b0 4' 45\" E., on the river An, 45 miles from its mouth. An important seat of transit trade between the Arakan coast and Independent Burma; it forms, indeed, the starting-place for the great trade route over the Yoma mountains to Ava. The pass rises from 147 feet to 4517 feet above the sea level. The descent is steepest on its eastern side, the gradients averaging 472 feet per mile. The stockade at the summit of the pass was captured from the Burmese by a British detachment in 1853. Population of An town (1881) 1492, chiefly engaged in commerce; houses, 401.\n\nAnagund\u00ed.\u2014The capital of the Narapathi dynasty of Southern India in the 14th century.\u2014See Vijayanagar.\n\nAn\u00e1hadgarh.\u2014Town in An\u00e1hadgarh tahsil, Pati\u00e1la State, Punjab. Population (1881) 5449, namely, Hindus, 2136; Sikhs, 1949; Jains, 27; Muhammadans, 1337. Number of houses, 1060; average inmates per house, 5\u00b714.\n\nAnaim\u00fadi (Anam\u00fadi).\u2014A plateau in the upper ranges of the Anamalai Hills, in Travancore State and Coimbatore District, Madras Presidency, averaging 7000 feet above the level of the sea, and enjoying a climate similar to that of Utakamand (Ootacamund). The plateau is uninhabited, except for occasional visits from ibex-hunters or the wild hill tribe of Puliy\u00e1rs. This jungle tribe sell to the people of the plains great quantities of honey, which they obtain at a fearful risk, by swinging themselves at night (when alone can the formidable rock bees be approached) by long chains of rattan rings over the precipices, to the face of which the honeycombs are ind ched. Between Anaim\u00fadi and the next plateau lies an extensive flat plain watered by several streams.\n\nAnak\u00e1palle (Anakapalli).\u2014Estate in Vizagapatam oistrict, Madras Presidency. Originally only tributary to the Vizper ram R\u00e1j\u00e1s, it passed entirely into the hands of the family by purchase at auction in 1802, subject to a tribute (peshkash) to Government of \u00a32997 per annum, and was resold by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 to Gode Jaggappa. It consists of 16 villages and 17 hamlets, and comprises some of the richest land in the District. Annual rent value, with five other attached estates, \u00a317,609.\nAnak\u00e1palle.\u2014T\u00e1luk in Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency. Area, 313 square miles. Contains 145 towns and villages, and 154 hamlets, all zam\u00ednd\u00e1r\u00ed (belonging to private estate-holders), with 27,929 occupied houses and 131,637 inhabitants. Classified according to religion, there were in 1881\u2014Hindus, 130,267; Muhammedans, 1367; and Christians, 3. Government land revenue, as apart from zam\u00ednd\u00e1r\u00ed, \u00a3127. One criminal court. In civil matters, it is within the jurisdiction of the munsif\u2019s court at Rayavaram. Chief town, Anak\u00e1palle.\n\nAnak\u00e1palle (Anakapilli).\u2014Town in Anak\u00e1palle t\u00e1luk in Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 17\u00b0 41' 20\" N., long. 83\u00b0 3' E. Situated on the S\u00e1r\u00e1danadi river and the great trunk road, 20 miles south-west of Vizagapatam; also connected by road with P\u00fadimadaka, which serves as its port. A rising town of recent growth, and an agricultural centre, with an export trade in molasses and a little cotton. Population (1881) 13,341; namely, 13,197 Hindus and 144 Muhammedans; number of houses, 3810. The municipal revenue in 1880-81 amounted to \u00a3915. Birth-rate 29' per 1000, and death-rate 18'9 per 1000 of population included within municipal limits. Most of the surrounding country belongs to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Vizian\u00e1garam. There was a political disturbance here, speedily quelled, in 1832. Being the head-quarters (kasb\u00e1) of the t\u00e1luk, it possesses the usual subordinate courts, jail, dispensary, and school. In population, Anak\u00e1palle ranks fourth among the towns of the District.\n\nAnamalai (Annamally, literally \u2018Elephant Mountains\u2019).\u2014A range of hills and table-lands in Coimbatore District and Travancore State, Madras Presidency. Lat. 10\u00b0 13' 45\" to 10\u00b0 31' 30\" N.; long. 76\u00b0 52' 30\" to 77\u00b0 23' E. They form a portion of the great Western Gh\u00e1ts, and eventually merge into the Travancore Hills. A sub-montane strip (tar\u00e1i), overgrown (except on the side of Coimbatore District) with dense jungle, and dangerous from its malarious exhalations, belts their base; but the higher lands have been described in terms of admiration for their perennial streams, splendid timber, and excellent building stone. The soil supports a flora of extraordinary variety and beauty; while the climate equals in salubrity that of any sanitarium, and in suitability for coffee cultivation, etc., any plantation of Southern India. The scenery is said to be at once grand and lovely. These plateaux therefore seem, if their natural advantages have not been exaggerated, to fulfil in a singular degree all the requirements of a site for European colonization. Difficulty of access, want of labour, the fever-tract that encircles them, and the unhealthiness of the lower range, have, however, to be contended with. The hills are divided into two ranges\u2014the higher and the lower. The higher varies in height from 6000 to 8000 feet, and consists for the most part of open grassy hills and valleys, filled with a forest growth similar to that of the Nilgiris. It\ncontains Michael's valley, named after Captain Michael, who may be said to have discovered the range in 1851; and the Tanakka table-land. The lower range averages a height of 2000 feet, and is densely wooded with valuable timber. The Government forest, which for many years supplied the Bombay dockyards with teak, lies at the extreme west of this range. It includes not only the reserved forest within the Coimbatore limits, which is the sole property of Government, but also an extent of forest within Malabar District, leased for 99 years from the proprietor, the Namburi of Kolingad, on a stump fee for all timber felled. The estimated extent of this forest is 80 square miles. The teak trees are felled on the plateau about 3000 feet above sea level, and the logs are dragged by trained elephants to timber slides, by which they are slipped down to the plain. Some logs are floated by river to Ponani, others are carted to Potanur junction or Coimbatore, on the Madras Railway, and others are brought and sold at the depot in Anamalai town. The saw is very little used in this forest; the work is done by skilled Malayalam axe men from Palghat. Since the abolition of the Bombay dockyard, the receipts from this forest have seriously fallen off, and the Burma teak competes with the Anamalai timber in the market. The teak in the forest had been overworked, and some years must elapse before it can recover. The chief streams of these hills are the Khundali, Torakadavu, and Konalar. The two latter meet at the foot of Pal Malai, where the joint stream pours over a precipice 300 feet high, and (under the name of the Torakadavu) rushes down densely-wooded gorges to the lowlands, where it joins the Ponai. The chief peaks are Anamudi, 8850 feet, the highest in Southern India; Tangachi, 8147; Kathu Malai, 8400; Kumarikal, 8200; and Karrinkola, 8480. Five others average a height of 7200 feet. The range of the thermometer throughout the year is not known; but in December it has been as low as 30\u00b0 F., and from February to May 1874 the minimum recorded was 45\u00b0; the maximum 86\u00b0. Geologically, the Anamalai range resembles the Nilgiris, being gneiss of the metamorphic formation, freely veined with felspar and quartz, and interspersed with reddish porphyrite. The abundance of teak, veng\u00e9 (Pterocarpus marsupium), blackwood (Dalbergia latifolia), and bamboos, make the flora of great commercial value. Several new species of plants have been found. Elephants, bison, sambhar, and ibex are still numerous.\n\nThe hills are virtually uninhabited. On the northern and western sides are found small scattered colonies of Kaders ('lords of the hills') and Malassers. Over a wider range, members of the Puliyar and Maravar tribes are met with. The Kaders will perform no menial labour, but make excellent guides and assistants to sportsmen. They are described as a truthful and obliging people, exercising some\ninfluence over the other forest folk. They are of small stature, and in feature slightly resemble the African; but their type is that of other aboriginal hill tribes, and is more nearly allied to the Australian than to that of the negro. They file the front teeth of the upper jaw as a marriage ceremony. The Malassers are more amenable to civilisation, and occasionally take to cultivation and adopt settled habits. The Puliy\u00e1rs are a wild-looking race, who number in all about 200, living in five villages among the lower plateaux. Their religion is a demon-worship, their marriage system monogamous, and their food anything. They are the only natives available for carrying loads. The Marav\u00e1rs form a very small clan, distinguished for their timidity and nomadic habits. They have no fixed habitations, but wander over the mountains with their cattle, erecting temporary huts, and seldom remaining more than a year at one place. They worship the idols of the Puliy\u00e1rs. All these hill tribes are keen hunters, and eke out a subsistence by gathering wild forest produce, gums, stick-lac, turmeric, cardamoms, honey, and wax, which they sell or barter to the lowlanders, to whom they are generally in debt. Coffee-planting has already been commenced, and on the western side of the Torakadavu valley, three estates have been opened out. They have as yet been free from both leaf disease and the 'borer.' Land on the Anamalais is sold under the ordinary waste-land rules, at an upset price of 10s. per acre, plus the cost of demarcation, the purchaser guaranteeing to bring the lands under cultivation within a certain period. Although at present uninhabited, the upper plateaux disclose traces of a population in pre-historic times, in numerous dolmens, or Cyclopean monuments, similar to those found on the Nilgiris and Shevaroys, and in the plains of Coimbatore, Salem, and Malab\u00e1r.\n\nAnamalai.\u2014Town in Coimbatore District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 10\u00b0 35' N., long. 76\u00b0 59' 30\" E. Situated on the Aliy\u00e1r river, 23 miles south-east of Palgh\u00e1t, and 10 miles from the lower spurs of the Anamalai range. Population (1881) 5578; namely, Hindus, 4853; Muhammadans, 723; Christians, 2; number of occupied houses, 1239. Rice is largely cultivated, but the principal crop is a dry one\u2014cholum (Sorghum). A large tract of forest land has been gradually cleared away towards the south, to make room for the augmented cultivation required. An important Government depot for the timber felled in the neighbouring plateau has long been established here, a good cart-road connecting it with Poll\u00e1chi. A market, chiefly for forest produce, is held weekly. Anamalai is described by Ward and Connor as having been an important town about the middle of the 18th century; almost all the temples in the place were destroyed by Tipu Sult\u00e1n.\n\nAnamasam\u00fadrampet.\u2014Village in Nellore District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 14\u00b0 41' 40\" N., long. 79\u00b0 43' E. Contains a fine mosque, one of the most ancient in this part of the country, and the scene of a\ngreat annual gathering in July of nine days, to celebrate the *Urusu*, a festival held in honour of the founder, Khw\u00e1ja Rahmat-ull\u00e1. The mosque has an endowment of eight villages, its trustee holding the title of *Pirz\u00e1da*.\n\n**Anand.**\u2014Sub-division of Kaira District, Bombay Presidency. Area, 243 square miles, with 2 towns and 72 villages, and 35,901 occupied houses. Population (1881) 154,118; namely, Hindus, 140,506; Muhammadans, 12,118; 'others,' 1494. Males, 83,229, and females, 70,889. Average density of population, 634 per square mile. Formed in 1867 from the Nadiad, Mah\u00fadha, Th\u00e1sra, and Borsad sub-divisions. Of the total area, 17 square miles are occupied by the lands of alienated *mehw\u00e1si* villages; 86\u00b763 per cent. are cultivated, and 2 per cent. are cultivable waste, the remainder being taken up by roads, rivers, ponds, and village sites. Except towards the east, where the land is bare of trees, uneven and seamed with deep ravines, the whole is a flat, rich plain of light soil, well tilled and richly wooded. The water supply is scanty. The average rate per acre of assessed arable land is 4s. The rates of assessment, introduced between 1863 and 1867, remain in force till 1891\u201392. Of the total population, 91 per cent. are Hindus, chiefly of the Koli and K\u00fanbi castes.\n\n**Anand.**\u2014Chief town of the Anand Sub-division, Kaira District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 22\u00b0 32' 30\" N., long. 73\u00b0 0' 45\" E.; population (1881) 9271; Hindus 8120, Muhammadans 534, Jains 530, Christians 75, P\u00e1rs\u00eds 8, 'others' 4. A station on the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway, 40 miles south of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d. The town contains the ordinary sub-divisional courts and buildings, and a post-office.\n\n**Anand\u00e1pur.**\u2014Christian village in Coorg. Population (1881) 150. Church and school. A Christian settlement was established here in 1857 by the Basel Mission, composed chiefly of liberated Holeyas, who were formerly the slaves of the Coorgs.\n\n**Anandpur.**\u2014Petty State in North K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency. Consists of 33 villages, having 7 independent tribute-payers. Estimated revenue in 1876, \u00a32911; tribute paid to the British Government, \u00a371, 10s.; to the Naw\u00e1b of Jun\u00e1garh, \u00a320, 10s.\n\n**Anandpur.**\u2014Town in Una *tahsil*, Hoshi\u00e1rpur District, Punjab; situated at the base of Naina Devi peak, on the left bank of the river Sutlej (Satlaj). Lat. 31\u00b0 15' N., long. 76\u00b0 34' E. Founded in 1678 by Guru Govind, the tenth and last spiritual successor of N\u00e1nak, the founder of the Sikh faith. Residence of the principal branch of the sacred family of Sodh\u00eds, or descendants of Guru R\u00e1m D\u00e1s (*see* Amritsar District), and head-quarters of the Nihang sect of Sikhs. The town is known as Anandpur Makhow\u00e1l, to distinguish it from other towns of the name of Anandpur. The name means 'city of rest' or 'enjoyment,' and seems to have been conferred by, or in the time of, the Sikh Guru Govind.\nGreat annual religious fair, attended by an enormous concourse of Sikhs. Centre of trade for Jandbar\u00ed or trans-Sutlej tract. Head-quarters of police sub-division, post-office, dispensary. Population (1881) 5878, comprising 3589 Hindus, 1361 Sikhs, and 928 Muhammadans; number of inhabited houses, 1378. The town has been constituted a municipality of the third class. Municipal income in 1880\u201381, \u00a3236; expenditure, \u00a3193.\n\nAnandpur.\u2014Village in Midnapur District, Bengal, with considerable silk manufacture. Lat. 21\u00b0 41' 50\" N., long. 87\u00b0 35' 30\" E. Population (1881) 3351.\n\nAnant\u00e1giri.\u2014Village in Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency. Situated 3111 feet above the sea, on the crest of the Galikonda Hills, which here form the boundary between the Vizian\u00e1gram and Panchipenta domains. Population about 250. Coffee estate.\n\nAnant\u00e1pur.\u2014Ancient town in the S\u00e1gar t\u00e1luk, Shimoga District, Mysore State. Lat. 14\u00b0 4' 50\" N., long. 75\u00b0 15' 10\" E.; population (1881) 503. This town was several times the point of attack during the wars of Haidar and Tipu, and in the insurrection of 1830.\n\nAnant\u00e1pur (Anantapuram).\u2014District in the Madras Presidency, created on the 5th January 1882, comprising the seven t\u00e1luks of G\u00fatti (Gooty), T\u00e1dpatri, Anant\u00e1pur, Dharm\u00e1varam, Penukonda, Madaks\u00edra, and Hindupur, which previously formed part of Bell\u00e1ry District. The separation of these seven t\u00e1luks from the large and unwieldy District of Bell\u00e1ry is one of several administrative improvements in the Madras Presidency since the famine of 1877. Anant\u00e1pur District lies between 13\u00b0 41' and 15\u00b0 13' N. lat., and 76\u00b0 50' and 78\u00b0 12' E. long.; area, 5103 square miles; population (1881) 599,889. In point of size Anant\u00e1pur ranks fifteenth, and in population twentieth, among the Districts of the Madras Presidency. It contains 900 inhabited villages, including 10 towns. Bounded on the north by Karn\u00fal (Kurnool) District, on the south and west by Mysore territory and Bell\u00e1ry District, and on the east by Cuddapah District.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District in its northern and central portions is a high plateau, generally undulating, with large granite rocks or low hill ranges rising here and there above its surface. Trees are scarce except in the immediate neighbourhood of villages. In the north, regada or black cotton soil prevails, but farther south this gives place to red soil. In the southern t\u00e1luks the surface is more hilly. The plateau there rises to 2600 feet above the sea level. In the northern t\u00e1luks water is scarce, but in the southern, which are the garden of the District, it is abundant. The sacred Penn\u00e1r, which flows through five of the seven t\u00e1luks, is dry for the greater part of the year. On its banks stand Hindupur, the chief town of the t\u00e1luk of that name, Penna-hobleem (which possesses a very sacred Hindu temple frequently visited by\npilgrims), P\u00e1midi (famous for its dyed cloths), and T\u00e1dpatri, the temples in which attract about 20,000 votaries annually. The river Chitravati rises in the south of the District, and fills the large tanks at Bukkapatnam and Dharmavaram. The low Muchukota hill ranges, and those farther south near Pamadurti, are worth mention simply as producers of the Harwickiabinata, a valuable timber. There is a remarkable fortress rock at G\u00fatti (Gooty) 2171 feet above sea level, and a similar but larger rock at Penukonda, with an elevation equal to that of Bangalore, i.e. about 3100 feet. Masses of granitic rock are numerous. Good iron is to be had in abundance. Copper, lead, antimony, and alum are all found. Salt and saltpetre are extracted from the soil. The diamond mines in the T\u00e1dpatri and Gooty taluks have not yielded any revenue since 1813, but are now again attracting attention. The fauna of the District includes among mammals the tiger (very rare), leopard, cheeta or hunting leopard, wolf, black bear, hy\u00e6na, wild boar, antelope, and deer. Birds of prey of many sorts are common. There are also the bustard, florican, peafowl, partridge, snipe, goose, various kinds of waterfowl, parrots, and numerous small birds. Venomous snakes are occasionally seen. The flora is scanty. The babul (acacia-arabica), the ber, and the wild date are the chief indigenous trees. The mango, the cocoa-nut, the palm, the tamarind, the banian, and many other trees have been introduced.\n\nHistory.\u2014This District formed part of the kingdom of Vijayanagar. In 1564, at the battle of T\u00e1likut, the Vijayanagar sovereign R\u00e1ma R\u00e1j\u00e1 was overthrown by the allied armies of the Sult\u00e1ns of Bijapur, Golkonda, Daulat\u00e1b\u00e1d, and Ber\u00e1r, and his capital was then plundered and destroyed. R\u00e1ma R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s brother, Tirumala R\u00e1j\u00e1, retired to Penukonda, which place bears signs of having formerly been a populous and extensive town. Anant\u00e1pur, the present head-quarters, was founded in 1364 by Chikkappa Udayar, Dew\u00e1n to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Vijayanagar. It was for some time the stronghold of a race of Naid\u00fas. Gooty fortress stands as a monument of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 power and heroism. The District around Gooty remained subject to Golkonda, and had in its own turn the p\u00e1leg\u00e1rs of R\u00e1idr\u00fag, Anant\u00e1pur, and Harpanhalli under subjection. After the death of Sivaji, the great Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 chief, in 1680, the whole District, which had made him a show of allegiance, was overrun by Aurangzeb, whose power was not, however, formally established, and the revenues of the District were never regularly remitted to the Imperial treasury. After Aurangzeb died, and the Niz\u00e1m rose into power, all the p\u00e1leg\u00e1rs, and notably of Gooty, asserted their independence. Meanwhile Haidar Ali, the usurper of the Mysore throne, was bent upon extending his supremacy over the neighbouring country. While Kodikonda, Madaks\u00edra, Hindupur, and others yielded, Gooty held its own, and successfully resisted his attacks and demands for a\ntime. Gooty, however, eventually succumbed to his power, and Haidar Ali made it his head-quarters for two years, and held his possessions against both the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and the Niz\u00e1m. The surrounding palay\u00e1ms became the acknowledged tributaries of Mysore. On Haidar\u2019s death, all of these threw off their allegiance to Mysore. Tipu, the son of Haidar, succeeding to the throne, brought back the rebellious chiefs to his authority. Tipu, however, was soon involved in war with the British. On the conclusion of the campaign in 1789, he had to part with his last conquests in favour of the Niz\u00e1m. In 1800 the Niz\u00e1m ceded certain tracts of land, the present District of Anant\u00e1pur included, to the East India Company in lieu of a Subsidiary British force. When the Company attempted to collect the revenue, a rebellion of the p\u00e1g\u00e9rgs broke out, which was, however, effectually quelled by General Campbell. The more turbulent were expelled from their estates, and the rest were terrified into submission. The revenue administration was entirely taken out of their hands, and the maintenance of armed forces prohibited. In 1800, Colonel Munro was appointed Principal Collector of the ceded Districts, which have ever since been under British rule. The t\u00e1lukhs which now form Anant\u00e1pur District were, as already stated, comprised within Bell\u00e1ry District of these ceded territories until 1882; and they have no separate administrative history from the rest of Bell\u00e1ry (q.v.).\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1881 gave a total population for Anant\u00e1pur District of 599,889 persons, as compared with 741,255 in 1871, showing a decrease of 141,366, or 19\u00b707 per cent., due to the Famine of 1876\u201378; the t\u00e1lukhs of Gooty and Madaks\u00edra were the tracts worst affected. The population in 1881 was returned as inhabiting 10 towns and 890 villages, in an area of 5103 square miles, and as occupying 119,128 houses. Number of persons per square mile, 117, varying from 172 in the t\u00e1luk of Hindupur to 81 in Dharm\u00e1varam; number of persons per occupied house, 5\u00b70. In point of density, Anant\u00e1pur stands nineteenth among the Districts of the Presidency. The males numbered 305,452, the females 294,437, the proportion being 509 males to 491 females in every 1000 of the total population. Of children under ten years, there were 61,697 boys and 64,241 girls, total 125,938; between the ages of 10 and 20, there were 72,748 males and 64,130 females, total 136,878. Classified by religion, 558,585, or 93\u00b712 per cent. of the total population, are Hindus; 40,239, or 6\u00b771 per cent., are Muhammadans; the remainder being 857 Christians, 129 Jains, and \u2018others\u2019 79. Among the Christians, the number of Europeans, Eurasians, and natives is included in the figures given for Bell\u00e1ry District. Classified according to worship, the Hindus are nearly equally divided between Sivaites and Vishnuvites, the small remainder being returned as Lingayats and \u2018others.\u2019 According to\ncaste, the Hindus were distributed as follows:\u2014Br\u00e1hmans (priests), 15,153, or 2'71 per cent.; Kshattriyas (warriors), 1153, or 0'21 per cent.; Shett\u00eds (traders), 15,232, or 2'72 per cent.; Vall\u00e1lars (agriculturists), 175,723, or 31'46 per cent.; Id\u00e1iyars (shepherds), 78,037, or 13'98 per cent.; Kamm\u00e1lars (artisans), 7403, or 1'33 per cent.; Kanakkan (writers), 268; Kaikalar (weavers), 24,682, or 4'42 per cent.; Vanniyan (labourers), 297; Kushavan (potters), 4972, or 0'89 per cent.; Sat\u00e1ni (mixed castes), 6523, or 1'17 per cent.; Shembadavan (fishermen), 82,257, or 14'72 per cent.; Sh\u00e1n\u00e1n (toddy-drawers), 5944, or 1'07 per cent.; Ambattan (barbers), 9286, or 1'67 per cent.; Vann\u00e1n (washermen), 12,387, or 2'21 per cent.; Pariahs, 78,240, or 14'01 per cent.; and \u2018others,\u2019 41,028, or 7'33 per cent. In this District, the proportion of agriculturists, shepherds, and fishermen is higher than the general average. Classified according to occupations, 7390 were returned as belonging to the professional class: of these, 463 were females; 1498 to the domestic class, of whom half were females; 7692 to the commercial class, of whom 1518 were females; 264,884 to the agricultural class, 106,951 being females; 70,435 to the industrial class, of whom 28,764 were females; the remainder, 247,990, to the indefinite and non-productive class, 155,986 being females. About 59'63 per cent. are returned as workers, on whom the remaining 40'37 per cent. of the population depend; 70'85 per cent. of males, and 47'98 per cent. of females were workers. The percentage of educated to the total population of each religion was, Hindus, males 8'95, females 0'28; Muhammadans, males 10'03, females 0'66; Christians, males 43'52, females 16'17. The Kor\u00e1vars deserve special notice as a class of habitual criminals. They speak a dialect of their own. Their dwellings are constructed of water-grass matting, and are carried from place to place, as the habits of the tribe are nomadic. They feed upon mice, rats, etc. They revere neither Br\u00e1hmans nor temples. A Kor\u00e1var can marry only one lawful wife. Early marriages are not known among them. About 10 towns have a population of over 5000, and 20 others over 2000 inhabitants each. Of the town population, 19'68 per cent. are Muhammadans; 80 per cent. of the total population may be considered as rural. Canarese, Telugu, and Hindust\u00e1ni are the languages spoken. Telugu is most commonly in use.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Of the total area (3,288,308 acres), 576,864 acres consist of barren ground, including sites occupied for non-agricultural purposes. Of the remainder, about one-third is under cultivation and assessed, and 613,504 acres are held as in\u00e1m or revenue-free. The area actually under tillage (1,067,749 acres) may therefore be taken at about one-third of the total area, and at 65'0 per cent. of the cultivable area. Of the cultivated area, 84,360 acres for the first crop, and 13,498 for the second, total 97,858 acres, were cultivated.\nunder irrigation. Of the cultivable area (1,641,219 acres) not under field cultivation, 20,620 acres are pasture and forest lands. The cultivated area is divided officially, as in other Madras Districts, into 'wet,' 'dry,' and 'garden' lands. Dry land is that on which crops are raised without the help of artificial irrigation. The chief crops are kambu, cholam, ragi, and korra, and these form the staple food of the masses. Wet lands are artificially irrigated, and are exclusively devoted to rice and sugar-cane. 'Garden' lands produce cocoa-nut, betel-leaf, plantains, wheat, tobacco, chillies, turmeric, vegetables and fruits. Manure in some form or other is always applied. Crops are not cultivated in any recognised order. The statistics of 1881\u201382 show that there were in that year in the District 26,847 buffaloes, 89,013 bullocks, 66,648 cows, 10,807 donkeys, 110 horses, 855 ponies, 241,250 sheep, 98,897 goats, 12,752 pigs, 6953 carts, and 51,433 ploughs. The prices of produce at the end of the same year, per maund of 80 lbs., were for rice, 5s. 3d.; for wheat, 5s. 1\u00bdd.; for other grains, from 2s. to 2s. 8\u00bdd.; for salt, 7s. 1\u00bdd.; for sugar, 32s.; for cotton, 8s.; and for hemp, 8s. 4d. The price of field bullocks ranges from \u00a35 to \u00a320 a pair. Buffaloes, though much cheaper, are seldom used for ploughing. The agricultural implements in use are all of the most primitive kind. There has been, however, a marked improvement of late in many points. The old cart, with solid wheels of stone or wood, the axle revolving with the wheel, has given place to open wheels, with tire, spokes, and axle. There appears to be a desire in the people to sink artesian wells and adopt English ploughs. People have begun to recognise and appreciate the principle of segregation during outbreaks of cattle distemper. Prices have been steadily rising. Where money payments obtain, agricultural labourers and ordinary artisans now receive double, and even treble, the wages given prior to 1850. The field labourers, however, are, as a rule, paid in kind, and the rise of prices of grain, therefore, has not affected them. In other cases, the cultivator has been benefited. Rice during 1840\u201350 averaged 24 lbs. for the shilling, between 1850\u201360 the price rose to 20 lbs., and since 1860 has averaged 10 lbs. for the shilling. Cholam, during the same period, rose in price from 58 to 38 and 23 lbs. for the shilling.\n\nNatural Calamities. \u2014 The earliest famine on record is that of 1792\u201393. In that year, rice, which is largely produced in Anantapur and other taluks in the District, sold at 4 lbs. for the shilling, and cholam, the staple food of the masses, at 12 lbs. for the shilling. Prices rose 300 per cent. in 1803, and wholesale emigration was the result. Cholera treading on the heels of the Gantur (Guntoor) famine in 1833, carried away thousands of persons at Gooty. There was also considerable mortality from starvation. In 1851, a storm swept over the District and damaged the tanks and irrigation works, and before the\ncompletion of the repairs, the ruin of the crops was consummated by heavy and unseasonable rainfall (1852). The failure of rain in 1853, six inches only having fallen, produced famine. A large portion of the cattle in the District succumbed to it, but prompt recourse to relief works arrested the spread of mortality among the people. In 1866, famine reappeared. Relief works helped to remove the popular distress in a great measure. Cholera broke out, and its ravages were so dreadful that people ceased to attend to their dead. Anantapur was one of the Districts most severely affected by the great famine of 1876-77. A system of organised relief, in the shape of public works, and of gratuitous distribution of food, checked its ravages to a considerable extent.\n\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014Among the agricultural products of the District, rice ranks first in the southern, and cotton in the northern parts. The former is largely exported to the surrounding British Districts of Cuddapah, Karnul (Kurnool), and Bellary, and also to the adjoining Districts of the Mysore State. Cotton goods, cloth, rope, and tape are the chief manufactures. Paper is also manufactured in the Dharmavaram taluk. Oil-seeds, sugar-cane, hemp, and indigo represent important mercantile interests. Jaggery is largely exported to other places. Gooty taluk still maintains its important industry of chintz-stamping. The manufacture of glass bangles is carried on in many places. Earth salt used formerly to be largely manufactured, but since the introduction of the Government monopoly this industry is now only clandestinely carried on. An Inspector of Salt Revenue with an establishment has recently been introduced into the District for the detection and prevention of illicit manufacture. The North-Western Line of the Madras Railway passes for 57 miles through the extreme north of the District, with stations at the towns of Tadpatri, Rayalcheruvu, Gooty, and Guntakal. The existing road and railway communication require development; there are only 857 miles of made road (imperial and local) in the District. The main road from Bangalore to Secunderabad enters the District near Kodikonda, and leaves it near Gooty, after passing through Anantapur town. Under the Local Fund Act a district road cess is levied at the rate of $6\\frac{1}{4}$ per cent. on the land assessment, to provide for the maintenance of the roads. One-third of this road cess, aided by various other receipts, is employed to supply the needs of the District in education, vaccination, sanitation, etc. There are neither newspapers nor printing-presses at Anantapur.\n\nAdministration.\u2014Until the 5th of January 1882, Anantapur District formed part of Bellary District, which was included in the tracts known as the Ceded Provinces. A full account of the revenue history of these provinces generally, will be found under the article on Bellary District, to which reference should be made. For admini-\nstrative purposes the District is divided into 7 taluks, namely, Anantapur, Dharmavaram, Gooty, Hindupur, Madaksira, Penukonda, and Tadpatri.\n\nCivil justice is administered by four grades of courts\u2014the village munsif's, the District munsif's, subordinate judge's, and the court of the Civil Judge. The last is also the Sessions Court for Criminal cases; subordinate to it are the magistrates of all grades. This District has not a separate Civil and Sessions Court, being included within the jurisdiction of the Bellary Judge. There is a sub-jail in each taluk, for the confinement of prisoners. The District Jail is in Bellary town. Police duties are conducted by a specially employed regular force, which numbered in 1881-82, 597 officers and men of all ranks, being in the proportion of 1 to every 1005 of the population. Anantapur is the only municipal town, with an annual income of \u00a3800 expended on local improvements.\n\nThe state of education in this District is backward, but steps are being taken to promote it. I have not received separate statistics of the schools included in Anantapur District, as distinguished from the general education returns for the District of Bellary, within which Anantapur was, until 1882, comprised.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate is peculiarly dry. The average annual rainfall is only 17 inches. The daily temperature ranges from 67\u00b0 F. to 83\u00b0 in November and December, and rises sometimes to as high as 100\u00b0 in May even at midnight. Since 1820, eighteen years have been officially recorded as seasons of epidemic cholera. Fever exists in an epidemic form. Small-pox is very common. Cattle diseases have several times made havoc, especially between 1840-50, and in 1857 and 1868. Gratuitous medical advice and attendance is provided from local and municipal funds for the poorer classes at the civil dispensaries at Gooty, Tadpatri, Kaliandrug, Penukonda, and Anantapur. The number of such dispensaries is being increased. There is no District surgeon.

Area, 868 square miles, with 123 villages and 16,466 occupied houses. Population (1881) 91,816, namely, males 47,546, and females 44,270; total revenue, \u00a319,486; land revenue (1881-82), \u00a310,775. Of the total acreage, about 70 per cent. is under cultivation, the 'wet' lands yielding the larger half of the whole assessment. The general appearance of the taluk is a level plain bounded on the north and north-east by hills. About 80 miles of made road keep communications open between the chief towns, Anantapur, Bukkarayasamudram,\nT\u00e1dmari, and Sing\u00e1namalla. The largest tanks of the t\u00e1luk are those of Anant\u00e1pur and Sing\u00e1namalla, each irrigating over 2000 acres. Chief town, Anant\u00e1pur. The highest point in the t\u00e1luk is Chiyedu Dr\u00fag, 1200 feet above the level of the plain. The t\u00e1luk is within the civil jurisdiction of the munsif at Gooty; number of criminal courts, 3; police stations, 9; strength of police, 144.\n\nAnant\u00e1pur.\u2014Town in Anant\u00e1pur District, Madras Presidency, 32 miles south of Gooty (G\u00fati), and 62 miles south-east of Bell\u00e1ry. Lat. 14\u00b0 40' 58\" N. long. 77\u00b0 39' E.; houses, 1133; population (1881) 4907, namely, Hindus 3488, Muhammadans 1407, and 12 Christians; municipal revenue (1880-81), \u00a3757; incidence per head of rateable population, 8d. The head-quarters of the District, with chief police and magisterial courts, sub-jail, dispensary, school, post-office, travellers' bungalow. Anant\u00e1pur, said to be the western limit of the true Karn\u00e1taka-desa or Canarese country, was founded in the 14th century by the D\u00edw\u00e1n of the Vijayanagar court, to whom the site was granted in consideration of military service, and in whose family it remained till Haidar Ali absorbed it in 1775. A large tank in the vicinity, constructed in 1364 A.D. by damming up the Pand\u00fa river, irrigates land assessed at \u00a31200.\u2014See Anantas\u00e1garam.\n\nAnant\u00e1pur.\u2014Shrine in the Ray\u00e1chot t\u00e1luk, Cuddapah District, Madras Presidency. The Gang\u00e1 J\u00e1tra festival is held here, and nearly all the S\u00fadra community of the surrounding villages assemble on the occasion. The importance of this festival has much lessened of late years.\n\nAnantas\u00e1garam.\u2014The ancient name of Hande Anant\u00e1pur ('The Eternal City of Hande'), a town in Anant\u00e1pur District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 14\u00b0 40' N.; long. 77\u00b0 40' E. It was built in 1364 A.D. by the D\u00edw\u00e1n of the Vijayanagar family, who dammed the Pand\u00fa river at this place, and built a village on either side of the stream, the western one being named Anantas\u00e1garam after his wife Anant\u00e1. The embankment was breached soon afterwards; and, to prevent similar disasters in the future, a daughter of the chief of the village was sacrificed to the river deity, being built up alive in the repairs of the breach.\n\nAnantas\u00e1garam.\u2014Town in the Atmak\u00far t\u00e1luk, Nellore District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 14\u00b0 34' 30\" N., long. 79\u00b0 26' 30\" E.; population (1881) 2548, namely, Hindus 2212, and Muhammadans 336; number of occupied houses, 533. Contains a fine mosque, and a remarkable tank, 40 feet deep, paved and riveted throughout; constructed 1522 A.D.\n\nAna\u00fak.\u2014Township in Tavoy District, Tenasserim Division, British Burma. A narrow strip occupying the western portion of the District, and traversed throughout its length by a low range of hills\n(highest point 500 feet), forming the western watershed of the river Tavoy. In the north is the large sweet-water lake Hein-seh (15 miles long and 6 to 8 miles broad), fed by numerous streams, and emptying itself into the sea by a narrow mouth obstructed by a sand-bar. Chief products, rice, the nipa palm, and salt. Population (1881) 24,630, 74 villages, 13 revenue circles. Gross revenue, \u00a36512; namely, land revenue, \u00a33813; capitation tax, \u00a31905; tax on nets, \u00a3180; salt tax, \u00a3233; local cess, \u00a3381.\n\nAnchittai-durgam.\u2014Hill fort in Salem District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 12\u00b0 21' N., long. 77\u00b0 45' 45\" E. Notable for its gallant defence in 1760 by Makdum Ali, against the superior forces of Khanda Rao. The village of Anchittai, in the vicinity, is 8 miles from the nearest Mysore boundary.\n\nAndaman Islands.\u2014Situated on the east side of the Bay of Bengal, and forming a continuation of the archipelago which extends from Cape Negrais in British Burma, to Achin Head on the north coast of Sumatra. They lie at a distance of 590 geographical miles from the Hugli mouth of the Ganges, and 160 miles from Cape Negrais, stretching from 10\u00b0 30' to 13\u00b0 45' N. lat., and from 92\u00b0 15' to 93\u00b0 15' E. long. They were surveyed in 1789-90 by Lieutenant Archibald Blair, who made a circuit of the entire archipelago, and who embodied the result of his researches in general charts, plans, and a Report containing much useful information for mariners. They consist of the Great and Little Andaman groups, surrounded by a number of small islands. The most considerable of these latter are Interview Island, immediately west of Stewart's Sound; Outram, Henry Lawrence, and Havelock Islands, east of Andaman Strait; and Rutland Island on the south. Between the Andamans and Cape Negrais there are two small groups, Preparis and the Cocos. The Great Andaman group, including Rutland Island (which might be looked upon as a continuation), is 156 miles in length and 20 miles in breadth, and it may therefore be said to have an area of about 1760 square miles. It comprises three large islands\u2014the Northern, Middle, and Southern Andaman, separated from each other by two narrow straits, of which one, Andaman Strait, is navigable; the other, separating Middle and North Islands, is not passable by boat at low water. Macpherson's Strait, separating Rutland from South Andaman, is navigable. The length of the different islands is as follows:\u2014North Andaman, 51 miles; Middle Andaman, 59 miles; South Andaman, 49 miles. The Little Andaman, which lies about 30 miles south of the larger group, is 30 miles long and 17 miles broad; it is separated from the main group by a strait called 'Duncan Passage.' Port Blair, the principal harbour, is situated on the south-east shore of the southern island of the Great Andaman group, in lat. 11\u00b0 41' 13\" N., and\nlong. $92^\\circ 42' 44''$ E. It is one of the most perfect harbours in the world, and half the British Navy might ride in it; while its central position in the Bay of Bengal gives it immense advantage as a place of rendezvous for a fleet. Stretching across the mouth of the harbour is Ross Island, running nearly north and south, with a passage into the port on either side. It was declared a port under the Indian Ports Act on the 18th April 1877. The other ports are\u2014Port Campbell, on the west coast of South Andaman; and Port Cornwallis, on the east coast of North Andaman.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The most conspicuous geographical feature of the islands is a central range of mountains in the Great Andaman group, the highest point of which, Saddle Peak, reaches an elevation of about 2400 feet, with an escarped side towards the east, and a sloping declivity to the west. There are many other little hills, most of them covered with jungle, 'scarcely to be equalled for its density and unhealthiness in any part of the Eastern world,' and the islands are indented by bays and inlets. On the east coast, as far south as Long Island, there is a great deficiency of water. The scenery is beautiful. Graceful forest trees shoot up to a height of more than 100 feet, with large clumps of bamboos, from 30 to 35 feet high; palms abound. The banian and the almond, the ebony, the sundri and the poplar, the redwood, and the iron-tree which turns the edge of the axe, are all found in the Andaman forests, mixed in beautiful confusion with cotton-trees, screw pines, and arborescent euphorbias. The mangrove is very abundant, inhabiting the low-lying pestilential swamps between the hills, and giving shelter to the loveliest orchids. Everywhere a dense undergrowth renders the jungle impenetrable by man or beast, and innumerable creepers, stretching from tree to tree, prevent the escape of malarious exhalations. The general character of the vegetation is Burmese, but there are also Malayan types not found on the adjacent continent. A remarkable fact in connection with these islands, is that cocoanut-trees are rarely seen on them, though they are abundant on the Nicobars, the nearest of which is 72 miles to the south, and on the Cocos, which are 30 or 40 miles to the north. There is a remarkable absence of animal life in the islands. Almost the only mammals are hogs (which are used for food), rats, and ichneumons. The iguana is found, also scorpions and snakes of various kinds. Birds are rare; amongst those observed are pigeons, paroquets, Indian crows, woodpeckers, kingfishers, and a few sea-fowl. Edible birds' nests are found in the recesses of the rocks. Fish in great variety is very abundant all round the coast; among other kinds may be mentioned grey mullet, rock cod, skate, soles; prawns, shrimps, cray-fish, oysters, etc. There are also large sharks. Turtles are plentiful, and are frequently sent to Calcutta. Near Port Blair, in the South Andaman, the principal rocks\nare grey tertiary sandstone; in other parts, serpentine and indurated chloritic rock are seen. Traces of coal have been discovered in the rock, but no seam. Coral reefs surround the islands on all sides; on the west they are continuous and extensive, and reefs occur 20 or 25 miles from the shore.\n\nHistory.\u2014The islands cannot be identified with certainty in Ptolemy, but Colonel H. Yule, from whose admirable account in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica much of the information in this article is taken, thinks it 'probable that this name itself is traceable in the Alexandrian geographer.' The name Andaman first appears distinctly in a remarkable collection of Arab notes on India and China (9th century), translated by Renandot and again by Reinaud. 'But it seems possible,' says Colonel Yule, 'that the tradition of marine nomenclature had never perished; that the \u1f08\u03b3\u03b1\u03b8\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bd\u1fc6\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 was really a misunderstanding of some form like Agdaman, while \u039d\u1fc6\u03c3\u03bf\u03b9 \u0392\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9 survived as Lank\u00e1 B\u00e1ll\u00fas, the name applied by the Arabs to the Nicobars. The islands are briefly noticed by Marco Polo, who probably saw, without visiting them, under the name Angamanain, seemingly an Arabic dual, \"the two Angamans.\" Our connection with the islands began in 1789, when the Bengal Government established on them a convict settlement, and a harbour of refuge for ships blown out of their course. During seven years the settlers struggled against the deadly malaria of the jungles, the arrows of the natives, and the failure of supplies from the mainland; till, in 1796, the Indian Government found itself compelled to bring away the remnant and to abandon the Colony. Throughout the next half-century, the Andamans appear in the records only as a cluster of cannibal islands, peopled with fierce fish-eating tribes, who promptly killed the savant we had sent to study their natural history, cut off stragglers from two troop-vessels that had gone ashore, and murdered shipwrecked crews. These atrocities at length forced on the Indian authorities the re-occupation of the islands. A new settlement was projected in 1855, and the number of life prisoners left by the Mutiny, led to the establishment of the present convict colony in 1858, when the whole group was formally annexed, and placed in 1872 under an officer who is now styled 'Chief Commissioner and Superintendent, Andaman and Nicobar Islands,' in direct correspondence with the Supreme Government. The first officer who was then appointed in charge of the settlement was Captain H. Mann. The settlement had again a hard struggle for life. The Arab geographers describe the Andamanese as 'savages who eat men alive; black, with woolly hair; in their eyes and countenances something frightful; who go naked, and have no boats\u2014if they had, they would devour all who pass near.' These stories, and Marco Polo's legend of them as dog-faced anthropophagi, gave place to stern\nrealities. The convict settlement found itself surrounded by savages of a low and ferocious type, who decorated themselves with red earth, mourned in a suite of olive-coloured mud, used crying to express the emotions of friendship or joy, bore only names of common gender which they received before birth, and whose sole approach to the conception of a God, was that of an evil spirit who spread disease. For five years they continued bitter enemies of the colony, 'repulsing all approaches with treachery, or by showers of arrows,' murdering every one who strayed into the woods, and plotting robberies and arsons of a merciless sort. By degrees, however, the British officers persuaded them to a better mind, by stern reprisals on the guilty, and by building homes near the settlement for the less hostile\u2014sheds where they might be protected from the tropical rains, and receive food and medicines. Latterly an orphanage has been established for their children. The most memorable event in the history of the Andaman Islands is the assassination at the foot of Mount Harriet, of the lamented Earl of Mayo, Viceroy and Governor-General of India, while on a tour of inspection, on the 8th February 1872. In 1876 a regulation for the government of these islands was passed, and is still in force. In 1877 the island of South Andaman was declared a settlement under its provisions.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The population of the Andamans, in addition to the convicts and the establishment required for their safe keeping, etc., consists of the aborigines, to whom reference has been made in the preceding paragraphs. The mutineer element, which was of course largely represented in the convict population, on the re-establishment of the settlement in 1858, has now nearly died out, and the colony is replenished from the jails of Bengal, Madras, Bombay, and British Burma. In 1867, the population of Ross Island, exclusive of the aborigines, was returned as follows:\u2014Prisoners of all classes, 2330; officials and free residents, 371; European troops, 111; sappers, 128; marines, 20; police, 60\u2014total, 3020. The total convict population of the whole settlement on the 1st January 1867 was 6678, of whom 6643 were Natives, and 35 Europeans and Eurasians. In 1870, the total convict population was 7460, and in 1871, 7603. Since then, only life prisoners have been sent to the colony. In 1881, there were at the end of the year 11,452 convicts, of whom 8790, or 76\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) per cent., were life, and 2662, or 23\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) per cent., term convicts. The gross cost per convict was \u00a313, 5s. 7\u00bdd. The number of self-supporting convicts in the same year were, 1982 men and 651 women. Owing to the withdrawal of the greater part of the Native Infantry garrison, the police force was raised in 1881 to 736 men of all ranks. The aborigines of the Andamans are of a very low type\u2014apparently negroid, whose origin is involved in obscurity. Indications are not\nwanting that the race to which they belong was widely diffused, tribes of somewhat similar character being found in the mountains of the Malay Peninsula, in the interior of Great Nicobar, in the Philippines, and even in Tasmania (the last now extinct). Their origin has been the subject of much discussion, and remains a curious and very interesting ethnographical problem. A r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of various hypotheses is given in the Calcutta Review for January 1878, No. cxxxii. Their skin is very black, and they are of small stature, very few of them exceeding 5 feet in height, while many are much shorter. They have a robust frame, and their unhealthiness must be attributed to the exposed nature of the lives they lead in a very damp climate. Few of them pass the age of forty, and the race seems to be gradually dying out. A gentleman who visited the islands in 1869, only saw one woman who had as many as three children; and he was informed that no other family possessed more than two. From April 1868 to 1869, 38 deaths were reported, and only 14 births, among the aborigines who resided near our settlements. In 1881\u201382, 27 deaths were reported amongst the aborigines residing near Port Blair. Their present number is unknown, conjecture varying from 2000 to 10,000; those who live in the neighbourhood of our settlements are divided into tribes, rarely above 30 strong. They go naked and live in leaf dwellings, or rather enclosures, which cannot be called huts; their food, which consists chiefly of turtle, wild roots and fruits, honey, fish, and when they can get it, hog, is always cooked. They are good archers, making their own bows and arrows, and they shoot and spear fish with great dexterity. They are quite at home in the water, being perfect divers and swimmers, and they manage their rough but neatly fashioned canoes very expertly. They are monogamists, and those under British influence seem to be of a kindly disposition among themselves, quite fearless, and though irritable, not vindictive. Their language is very deficient, they have no numerals, and the inhabitants of Little Andaman are said not to understand those of South Andaman. All the islands in the group are visited several times during the year, and friendly relations have been maintained and extended with the inhabitants of all, except those of Little Andaman, who still refuse to accept our advances towards them, and evince the utmost hostility on our approach. It is hoped that by frequent visits, and by showing our friendly intentions towards them, they may come to look upon us as friends and not as enemies. Even during the years which have elapsed since I commenced this Gazetteer, a considerable improvement in our relations with the natives has taken place.\n\nAgriculture is absolutely unknown to the aboriginal population; and with the exception of patches here and there, which have been cleared by the convicts, the islands are almost totally uncultivated. A small\ntea garden of about $3\\frac{1}{2}$ acres of china and hybrid shrubs, was started a few years ago, and the manufacture of tea has at last been commenced, the out-turn in 1881 being 142 lbs.; a sample of this tea was sent to Calcutta, and was valued at 2s. 4d. per pound, and very favourably reported on; the whole was taken over by the Commissariat Department at 2s. a pound. Sugar-cane, arrowroot, paddy, Indian corn, cocoa-nuts, and garden produce are all cultivated in ample quantities for local consumption. The area of land under cultivation and pasture in 1882 was nearly 10,000 acres, and the amount of actual revenue paid into the treasury, in 1881, was \u00a37401. Swamp reclamations and forest clearings are being carried on with great energy; cocoa-nuts are being largely planted, and it is expected that these plantations will in a few years yield a large revenue. Two new villages have been founded, one in the northern District, named Namuna Ghar, and the other in the southern, named Brookesabad. Sheep and cattle breeding is increasing yearly, and it is expected that the settlement will become self-supporting in a few years, in the matter of slaughter cattle. In 1881-82, there were 4225 horned cattle in the settlement.\n\nMedical Aspects, etc.\u2014The old ill-fame of the Andamans, as regards unhealthiness, is disappearing under a more careful medical supervision. The islands have been steadily improving in this respect for several years past. In 1881-82, out of an average convict population of 11,128, the average daily sick amounted to 1087; the percentage of deaths being only 4.56 per cent., as against 2 per cent. in 1869, 3.9 per cent. in 1868, and 10.16 per cent. in 1867. The percentage in 1871 was about the same as in 1870. In 1880-81, the daily average sick for the year was 11.09 per cent. as compared with 10 per cent. in 1879-80. The average annual death-rate from all causes for the five years ending 1880-81, is 5.1 per cent. The number of deaths in 1880-81 was returned at 522; and the largest number of admissions into hospital takes place in May. The climate is very moist; the islands being exposed to the full force of the south-west monsoon, only four months of fair weather (February to May) can be counted on. The rainy season lasts from June to September, and what is called the \u2018moderate\u2019 season, from October to January. The average annual rainfall at Port Blair for the fourteen years ending 1882 was 118.25 inches, varying from 100.09 to 155.7 inches. The annual mean temperature is about 82\u00b0 F. The aborigines suffer, as might be expected, from fevers, colds, lung complications, bowel complaints, headache, toothache, and rheumatism. They have recently begun to appreciate the value of quinine. The sea-tract around the Andaman Islands is, according to Piddington (Law of Storms), subject to cyclones \u2018of terrific violence, though they seem to be of rare occurrence.\u2019 Communication is kept\nup with Calcutta and Rangoon by a monthly mail service under contract with the British India Steam Navigation Company. [The Andaman Islands have formed the subject of a number of official Reports. See Selections from the Records of the Home Department; and for recent information, the Administration Report of the Andamans and Nicobars for 1882-83.]\n\n**Andar.**\u2014Gh\u00e1t in South K\u00e1nara District, Madras Presidency.

Government school.\n\n**Andhra.**\u2014Ancient name of one of the principal kingdoms in Eastern India, and at one time applied to the whole country of Teling\u00e1na, although this extended application ignored or included the coast kingdom of Kalinga. The Peutingerian Tables, presumed to be earlier than Ptolemy, omit all mention of Kalinga, but speak of Andr\u00e9 Indi. Ptolemy (A.D. 150) mentions Kalinga, but not Andhra. The Pur\u00e1n\u00e1s mention both\u2014as do Pliny and Hwen Thsang (A.D. 630). At the latter date, Andhra was recognised as one of the six great Dravidian Divisions. An Andhra dynasty, according to Wilson, reigned in Magadha about 18 B.C. Sanskrit writers call the Telugu language Andhra, and the Dravidian tongue generally Andhra-Dravida-Bh\u00e1sh\u00e1. The ancient capital is believed to have been Orangal (Warangal), afterwards the capital of the Ganapatis.\n\n**Andhra.**\u2014Estate in Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 18\u00b0 20' 45\" N., long. 83\u00b0 15' E.; population (1881) 7846, inhabiting 1791 houses, grouped into 50 villages and 11 hamlets; area, 3080 acres. This estate is all that to-day represents the great Dravidian Division of Andhra. The ancestor of the present proprietor obtained the estate from the Jaipur (Jeypore) chief, and on his descendants allying themselves with the Vizian\u00e1gram family, Andhra passed under the patronage of that house. It was assessed at the time of the Permanent Settlement at \u00a3138.\n\n**Andipatti.**\u2014Range of hills in Mad\u00fara District, Madras Presidency, running from the Travancore chain, and known during the last 15 miles of its length (altogether 55 miles) as the N\u00e1ga Malai. They nowhere exceed 3000 feet in height, and being covered with thorny scrub or\nquite bare rocks, are uninhabited. Abounding in game, bison, deer of several kinds, pigs, leopards, and, at certain seasons, elephants. Lat. of chief peak, $9^\\circ 56' N.$, long. $77^\\circ 44' 30'' E.$\n\n**Andipatti.**\u2014Town in Madura District, Madras Presidency.

Population (1881) 6041; namely, Hindus 5856, Muhammadans 13, and Christians, 172; number of houses, 819. The pagoda of Andipatti has received from Government, since 1806, an annual grant of \u00a324, which was formerly paid in cash, but is now deducted from the assessments on the village lands. The Paliaput of Andipatti comprises 8 villages, paying a revenue to the p\u00e2leg\u00e2r of \u00a31500, of which about \u00a3600 are paid as peshkash and road-cess to Government. The family is an ancient one, and is connected with some of the Madura p\u00e2leg\u00e2rs.\n\n**Andiyur.**\u2014Town in Coimbatore District, Madras Presidency. Lat. $11^\\circ 34' 45'' N.$, long. $77^\\circ 37' 45'' E.$ Situated on a tributary of the Bhawani river, 12 miles from Bhawani, and, by the District road, 30 miles from the Erode station of the Madras Railway.

The fort, maintained till 1800, is now a ruin. The town is notable for its temple, a building of great sanctity, and as having been the scene of one of the most desperate of the M\u00e1p\u00edlla (Mopla) outrages in 1849.\n\n**Angarb\u00e1ri.**\u2014A detached peak of the Saranda Hills in Singbh\u00fam District, Bengal; height, 2137 feet. Lat. 20\u00b0 30' N., long. 85\u00b0 37' 30\" E.\n\n**Anghad.**\u2014Petty State of the Dodka-Mehw\u00e1s in Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha, Bombay Presidency.

There are six chiefs, who pay a tribute of \u00a3174 to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda.\n\n**Angrez\u00e1b\u00e1d.**\u2014Town and civil station of Maldah District.\u2014See English Bazar.\n\n**Angul.**\u2014Government estate in Orissa, formerly a feudatory chiefship, but now under the direct management of the Bengal Government, lying between 20\u00b0 32' 5\" and 21\u00b0 10' 55\" N. lat., and between 84\u00b0 18' 10\" and 85\u00b0 42' 45\" E. long.; area, 881 square miles; population (1881) 101,903. It is bounded on the north by the States of R\u00e1dh\u00e1kol and B\u00e1mr\u00e1 in the Central Provinces; on the east by T\u00e1lcher, Dhenk\u00e1nal, and Hindol States; on the south by Narsinghpur and Daspall\u00e1 States and the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed river; and on the west by the State of Athmallik. With the exception of the southern portion, which is hilly, the country is level. The greater part remains buried under primeval jungle, but small patches are cultivated with rice, sugar-cane, oil-seeds, cotton, and millets. Valuable timber abounds in the forests, and Government reserves have recently been formed. Droughts frequently destroy the crops; scarcely any part is in danger of flood. The State was confiscated in 1847, in punishment for the ex-R\u00e1j\u00e1's continued disobedience, and his attempts to wage war against the English; his family receive pensions from Government. The estate is managed by a tahs\u00edld\u00e1r, or receiver, on behalf of the Bengal Government, under the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Cuttack. The estate is now in a prosperous condition, with a steadily increasing population. In 1872, it contained 78,374 inhabitants, which by February 1881 had increased to 101,903, namely, males 51,819, females 50,084. Divided according to religion, there are\u2014Hindus, 100,366; Muhammadans, 275; Christians, 6; and 'others' 1256, consisting of aboriginal tribes, who still retain their primitive forms of faith. The number of villages in the estate is 379, and of occupied houses, 17,719. Average density of the population, 115\u00b767 per square mile; villages per square mile, 0\u00b743; persons per village, 266; houses per square mile, 20\u00b713; persons per house, 5\u00b775. The chief villages are Angul and Chhindip\u00e1d\u00e1. The latter village is situated in 21\u00b0 5' N. lat. and 84\u00b0 55' E. long., and contained in 1862, 149 houses. Before 1847, no trade was carried on in Angul, but\nsince then fairs attended by traders from Cuttack and the neighbouring Districts have been established at several places. The Br\u00e1hman\u00ed river flows within a mile of the north-east boundary, and might form a valuable trade route for the products of the estate. The high road from Cuttack to Sambalpur passes through Angul, supplying a good means of communication and transport. Coal and iron are found. (For an account of the T\u00e1lcher coal-field, which includes a considerable portion of Angul, see Statistical Account of Bengal, vol. xix. pp. 325\u2013328.)\n\n**Angul.**\u2014Chief village of estate of the same name, in Orissa, and residence of the ex-R\u00e1j\u00e1\u2019s family. Lat. 20\u00b0 47\u2032 50\u2033 N., long. 85\u00b0 1\u2032 26\u2033 E.\n\n**Anjang\u00e1on.**\u2014Village in the Bhus\u00e1wal Sub-division, Kh\u00e1ndesh District, Bombay Presidency. Situated about 6 miles east of Edl\u00e1b\u00e1d.

Of the total population, 7714 were returned as Hindus, 1955 Musalm\u00e1ns, 6 Sikhs, and 167 Jains. A mart for cotton cloth, excellent basket-work, and p\u00e1n grown in the adjacent garden lands. Large weekly market. In December 1803, Sir Arthur Wellesley, with plenary powers from the Governor-General (Marquess Wellesley), here concluded with Wittal Panth, Sindhia\u2019s Prime Minister, the Treaty of Surji Anjang\u00e1on, which crushed the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 supremacy in Central India.\n\n**Anjang\u00e1on B\u00e1ri.**\u2014Town in Amr\u00e1oti District, Ber\u00e1r; 10 miles from Amr\u00e1oti town. Population (1881) 2888.\n\n**Anjanwel.**\u2014Seaport in Ratn\u00e1giri District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 17\u00b0 33\u2032 N., long. 73\u00b0 13\u2032 E. The town is situated on the south bank of the Anjanwel river in a little bay within the entrance. Inside the bar there is deep water up to 5, 6, and even 9 fathoms. Average annual value of trade for five years ending 1880\u201381\u2014Exports, \u00a3421,296; imports, \u00a3304,720; total, \u00a3726,016.\n\n**Anj\u00e1r.**\u2014Town in the State of Cutch (Kachchh), in political connection with the Bombay Presidency. Lat. 23\u00b0 5\u2032 45\u2033 N., long. 70\u00b0 9\u2032 45\u2033 E.; population (1881) 12,584, namely, 8380 Hindus, 3258 Muhammadans, 943 Jains, and 3 \u2018others.\u2019 Municipal income (1881), \u00a3263; expenditure, \u00a3233. Anj\u00e1r possesses a dispensary; patients treated in 1880\u201381, 12,228, of whom 33 were in-door. As a friendly return for the assistance rendered to the Chief of Cutch in recovering certain possessions, the town and District of Anj\u00e1r were ceded by him in 1816 to the East India Company. In 1822, the arrangement was modified by a new treaty, under which the territory ceded was restored, on condition of an annual money payment of \u00a38800. The only sum which\nhad hitherto been required from the State of Cutch was a contribution of 2 l\u0101khs of rupees (\u00a320,000) towards the expenses of the British subsidiary force. This, however, was not paid with regularity, and a large debt was allowed to accumulate. In 1832, therefore, a new treaty was executed, remitting to Cutch all arrears, and limiting the demand to 2 l\u0101khs, to be reduced in proportion to reductions made in the subsidiary force, provided that the sum to be paid should never be less than \u00a38800. [See Aitchison's Treaties and Engagements, 2nd ed.]\n\nOutside the town is a temple containing the image on horseback of Ajep\u00e1l, brother of the Chauh\u00e1n Chief of Ajmere, who in the beginning of the 9th century was driven out of Ajmere, and established himself as an anchorite in the town of Anj\u00e1r, to which he gave his name. Some land has been assigned for the maintenance of this temple, and a large number of ascetics have settled there. The spiritual head of these ascetics is called a P\u012br, or saint.\n\nAnjengo (Attinga, Anju-tenga: 'Five Cocoa-nut Trees').\u2014Town enclosed within the territory of Travancore State, but under the jurisdiction of Malab\u00e1r District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 8\u00b0 40' N., long. 76\u00b0 47' 50\" E.; population (1881) 2534, being 1315 Christians, 1054 Hindus, and 165 Muhammadans. Situated 72 miles north-west-by-west of Cape Comorin, on a strip of sandy soil on the coast of the Arabian Sea. An extensive back-water stretches behind the town. Station of a sub-magistrate. Formerly an important place, Anjengo has now declined to a mere fishing town. Owing to its isolation in native territory, its land trade suffers, while from the want of shelter for shipping it attracts little sea commerce. A strong surf beats on the shore; and as ships can find no safe anchorage nearer than 1\u00bd miles, communication with the land is always difficult. The water supply, moreover, is scanty and indifferent in quality. In 1684, the East India Company obtained permission from the R\u00e1n\u00ed of Attingal to occupy the site; and in 1695 a factory, with fortifications, was erected. Though the defects of the situation were from the first apparent, it was hoped that the facilities afforded for the collection of pepper, coir, and calicoes would compensate; and for a while Anjengo ranked as an important port. The 'Factor' was second in Council in Bombay; and under him were placed the ports of Koleche, Eddawa, and Villinjum. During the wars of the Karnatic, Anjengo was also found of use as a d\u00e9p\u00f4t for military stores, and as the point from which the first news of outward-bound ships reached Madras. These factitious advantages, however, did not compensate for natural defects; and in 1792, the town was reported to be in hopeless decline. In 1809, during the disturbances in Travancore, its roadstead was completely blockaded; and in the following year the post of Commercial Resident was abolished, and the station made subordinate to the Political Resident at Trevandrum. The\nold fort, now a ruin, was once of considerable strength. Robert Orme, the historian, was born here; and here, too, lived Eliza Draper, the lady of Sterne's affections.\n\n**Anji.**\u2014Town in Wardha District, Central Provinces; situated on the left bank of the Dh\u00e1m river, about 9 miles north-west of Wardha town.

Of the total area, 74'3 per cent. is cultivated, 4'6 per cent. cultivable, and 16'6 per cent. uncultivable waste; while 4'5 per cent. is occupied by village sites, roads, tanks, and rivers. Seven square miles are occupied by the lands of alienated villages. Average rainfall, 32 inches. The total assessment on Government and alienated lands, at rates assessed in 1871\u201372 and to remain in force until 1900\u20131901, amounts to \u00a360,364. Of the cultivated land 49 per cent. is occupied by cotton, 47'3 per cent. by grain crops, the remainder by pulses, oil-seeds, etc. Water supply good.\n\n**Ankleswar.**\u2014Chief town of the Sub-division of Ankleswar in Broach District, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 21\u00b0 37' 58\" N., long. 73\u00b0 2' 50\" E. It is also a station on the Bombay, Baroda, and Central India Railway, 6 miles south of Broach, and 3 miles from the left bank of the Narbad\u00e1. Connected by a road with H\u00e1nsot (in the Ankleswar Sub-division), 12 miles to the west, and with another running for 9 miles eastward towards N\u00e1ndod, in the State of R\u00e1jpipla (Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha Agency).

Situated 88 miles E.N.E. of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, Deccan. At first probably merely a pastoral chieftain, the founder of the kingdom gradually acquired influence and estates, and organized a sort of government at An\u00famakonda. The seventh in descent, K\u00e1kat\u00edya Pralaya (Prola or Prole) seems to have assumed the regal style and dignity, and from him the Warangal line received its original name. The Ganapati dynasty was overthrown by Muhammadan invaders in A.D. 1323, after a rule of about a century and a half. The most famous sovereigns were the two Prat\u00e1pa Rudras, both of whom made extensive conquests, and Rudramma the queen, mother of Prat\u00e1pa Rudra II., who ruled for about 40 years, as mentioned by Marco Polo.\u2014See TELINGANA.\n\nAn\u00fapgarh.\u2014Chief town of the district of the same name in B\u00edkaner State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Situated on the Sotra river, and contains a strong fort.\n\nAn\u00fapshahr.\u2014Tahsil of Bulandshahr District, North-Western Provinces, lying along the right bank of the Ganges, and comprising the pargan\u00e1s of An\u00fapshahr, Ah\u00e1r, and Dib\u00e1l. Area, 448 square miles, of which 330 are cultivated; population (1881) 213,294; land revenue, \u00a329,352; total revenue, \u00a333,308; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a382,467. The administrative staff consists of one tahsild\u00e1r and four honorary magistrates. Five police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); strength of regular police force, 69 men; with 79 municipal and town police, and 491 village watchmen (chaukidd\u00e1s).\n\nAn\u00fapshahr.\u2014Town in Bulandshahr District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of An\u00fapshahr tahsil. Lat. 28\u00b0 21' N., long. 78\u00b0 18' 55\" E. Situated on the military route from Aligarh to Bud\u00e1un, 75 miles south-east of Delhi on the high western bank of the Ganges, which is liable to erosion when the river is in flood. Founded in the reign of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr by the Badg\u00fajar R\u00e1j\u00e1, An\u00fap R\u00e1i, from whom it derives its name. In 1757, Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Abd\u00e1l\u00ed placed his canton-\nments here, where two years later he organized his coalition against the J\u00e1ts and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, which led to their overthrow at the battle of P\u00e1nipat in 1761. In 1773, the combined forces of the Oudh W\u00e1z\u00edr and the British made An\u00fapshahr their rendezvous, when opposing the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 invasion of Rohilkhand; and from that date till 1806, An\u00fapshahr was garrisoned with British troops, afterwards removed to Meerut. Population (1881) 8234; namely, Hindus, 6479; Muhamma-dans, 1731; Jains, 24; area of town site, 551 acres. Municipal revenue in 1880-81, \u00a3579; expenditure, \u00a3588. With the revenue derived from octroi and a house tax, a proper conservancy establishment is kept up, and much attention is directed to local improvements. The Ganges is here crossed by a bridge of boats in the dry weather, and by a ferry in the rainy season. The town is resorted to by Hindu pilgrims, who bathe in the Ganges at certain seasons. The largest assemblage is on the full moon of K\u00e1rtik (November\u2013December), when about 50,000 persons collect together from all quarters; but as a bathing place, R\u00e1jgh\u00e1t, owing to its position on the railway, has become more popular. Owing to its central position on a great navigable river, An\u00fapshahr has great commercial advantages; but since the opening of the railway station at R\u00e1jgh\u00e1t on the Oudh and Rohilkhand railway, 9 miles to the south-east, much of the traffic of the town has been diverted to Dibhai. The population is yearly decreasing, and the trade is now confined to timber and bamboos, for which it is still a large d\u00e9p\u00f4t. There is some local manufacture of coarse and fine cloths, blankets, boots, bullock carts, soap, shoes, etc.; but the traffic is mainly confined to the neighbouring villages in exchange for grain. Tahs\u00edl, post-office, dispensary, vernacular school, mosque, and several small temples, but none of any interest; good sar\u00e1i or inn for native travellers.\n\n**Anwa.**\u2014Town in Silod t\u00e1luk, Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d territory, Niz\u00e1m\u2019s Dominions; situated on the river J\u00faa, 5 miles south of Sheoni. Population, 2000. Large d\u00e9p\u00f4t for cotton, which is exported to Kh\u00e1mg\u00e1o\u0144 and Jalg\u00e1m. The chief object of interest is a small temple with a stone roof, supported on a number of pillars, covered with small sculptured figures, beautifully carved. The annual fair, held in connection with this temple, is largely attended. Weekly market on Fridays. In the year 1859, the town was sacked by a band of Rohill\u00e1s from Jafar\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\n**Aonla.**\u2014Tahs\u00edl in Bareilly (Bareli) District, North-Western Provinces, comprising the four pargan\u00e1s of Aonla, Balia, Saneha, and Sarauli. Lat. 28\u00b0 16' 25\" N., long. 79\u00b0 12' 25\" E.; area, 308 square miles, of which 225 are cultivated; population (1881) 197,636. Contains large patches of scrub jungle, and is traversed by the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway. Land revenue, \u00a324,778. The tahs\u00edl\ncontains one criminal court and four police stations (th\u00e1n\u00e1s); strength of regular police, 62 men, with 371 chaukid\u00e1rs or village watchmen.\n\n**Aonla.**\u2014Ancient town in Bareilly (Bareli) District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Aonla tahsil. Situated on a branch of the river Aril, 16 miles south-west of Bareilly. Lat. 28\u00b0 16' 25\" N., long. 79\u00b0 12' 25\" E. Population (1881) 13,018; namely, Muhammadans, 6613; Hindus, 6391; Christians, 14. Area, 142 acres. The town contains a splendid tomb of the Rohill\u00e1 leader, Al\u00ed Muhammed, whose capital it was, and who died here in 1751. For more than a quarter of a century (1748\u201374), Aonla remained the seat of the Rohill\u00e1 court. It was then a place of considerable importance, but on the overthrow of the Rohill\u00e1s it sank into insignificance, and has since remained merely the chief of the tahsil. The town stands on a well-wooded site, surrounded by orchards. It is divided into four distinct quarters or wards, which are in fact separate villages, the intervals between them being filled with shady graveyards or decaying mosques. Aonla is a city of tombs, the relics of the time when it was the capital of Rohilkhand, and the court of a powerful ruler. The two principal streets of the town contain some respectable buildings; several new masonry structures show signs of returning prosperity. It is a station on the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway, with a large b\u00e1z\u00e1r, the usual sub-divisional buildings and a post-office, police station and dispensary. The Chaukidari Act xx. of 1856 is in force, and a small revenue from a house tax is raised for police and conservancy purposes.\n\n**Appecherl\u00e1 (Appicherla).**\u2014Town in Anant\u00e1pur District, Madras Presidency; population (1881) 2287. Large tank.\n\n**Appekondu (Appikonda, Sameswar\u00e1du).**\u2014Village on the sea-coast in Vizagapatam District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 17\u00b0 40' N., long. 83\u00b0 25' E.; population (1881) 570. Remarkable for its sacred shrine of Siva as Sameswar\u00e1du, where ceremonies for the removal of calamitous stellar conjunctions are supposed to have peculiar efficacy. Numerous pagodas, which once existed in the neighbourhood, have long been buried under sand-drifts. Formerly part of the Chip\u00farapilli estate. The village now forms a separate property, held at an annual rent to Government of \u00a360.\n\n**Ar.**\u2014Ancient city in Udaipur Native State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na.\u2014See Ahar.\n\n**Ar\u00e1ch\u00e1lur.**\u2014Village in the Erode taluk, Coimbatore District, Madras Presidency; houses, 1172; population (1881) 5035; namely, Hindus, 4909; Muhammadans, 10; Christians, 116.\n\n**Ar\u00e1gonda.**\u2014Village in the Chitt\u00far taluk, North Arcot District, Madras Presidency; 14 miles north-west of Chitt\u00far. Population (1881) 1736; namely, Hindus 1678, and Muhammadans 58. Moderate trade in grain and molasses. The name of the town is derived from the\nappearance of the hill close by it, which looks as if split in half; *ara*, half; and *konda*, mountain.\n\n**Arail.**\u2014*Tahsil* of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces (sometimes called the Kurch\u00e1na *tahsil*, after the head-quarters village), lying to the south of the river Jumna (Jamun\u00e1). Area, 263 square miles, of which 170 are cultivated; population (1881) 53,430; land revenue, \u00a326,528; total revenue (including cesses), \u00a330,556; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a338,490; incidence of land revenue, 3s. 1\u00bdd. per acre of total area. Kurch\u00e1na, the head-quarters, is a mere village with a population in 1881 of 805, but is a station on the East Indian Railway. *Tahsili*, second class police station, school, and post-office. The *tahsil* contains one criminal court, with two police stations (*th\u00e1n\u00e1s*); strength of regular police, 33 men, with 261 *chaukid\u00e1rs* or village watchmen.\n\n**Arail.**\u2014Village in Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d District, North-Western Provinces, situated on the high southern bank of the Jumna, at the point of its confluence with the Ganges. Population (1881) 755. The village is the site of a very old Hindu city, the date of its foundation being lost in antiquity. It was partially rebuilt by Akbar, who called it Jalal\u00e1b\u00e1d, but this name has now been lost.\n\n**Arakan.**\u2014The most northern of the four Divisions or Provinces of British Burma, comprising the Districts of Akyab, Arakan Hill Tracts or Northern Arakan, Kyauk-pyu, and Sandoway (*gg.v.*). Area (exclusive of Hill Tracts not under immediate British administration), 14,526 square miles, with 2 towns and 3528 villages; number of houses, 116,046, of which 111,750 are occupied and 4296 unoccupied. Total population (1881) 587,518; namely, 317,773 males and 269,745 females. Average density of population, 40\u00b745 per square mile; villages per square mile, 0\u00b724; persons per village, 167; houses per square mile, 7\u00b798; persons per house, 5\u00b726. Classified according to religion, there were\u2014Buddhists, 422,396; Muhammadans, 106,308; Hindus, 9393; Christians, 1214; and *Nat* worshippers, or aboriginal non-Buddhists, 48,207. The agricultural population is returned at 447,922, or 76\u00b724 per cent. of the whole. Of the total area of 14,526 square miles, only 841 square miles have been assessed for Government revenue, and of these 823 are returned as under cultivation. Total Government land revenue, including rates and cesses on the land, \u00a398,123, or an average of 3s. 6\u00bdd. per acre of cultivated land. Arakan is a narrow seaboard strip, shut in on the east by the Arakan Yoma mountains, and extending from the Naaf estuary in the north to the Khwa river in the south. At its annexation in 1826, Rakaing-pyi-gyi, or the Arakan kingdom, was formed into a Province under the Bengal Government. It then extended as far south as Cape Negrais, and was divided into the four Districts of Akyab, An, Ramri (Ramree),\nand Sandoway. When Pegu was annexed, in 1852, the lower portion of Arakan between the Kyeintali and Cape Negrais was joined to Bassein District. Subsequently, the northern part of this tract, between the Kyeintali and the Gwa, was restored to Arakan. Arakan is administered by a Commissioner and subordinates, whose headquarters are at Akyab town. Gross revenue (1881-82) \u00a3300,223. A full account of the history of Arakan under native rule, and of its annexation by the British, will be found under Akyab District, which contains the capital of the ancient kingdom and the principal town of the modern Province, and which has formed the theatre of the most important events in its annals.\n\nArakan.\u2014The ancient capital of Arakan.\u2014See Mro-haung.\n\nArakan Hill Tracts (or Northern Arakan).\u2014District in the Arakan Division, British Burma; not strictly demarcated, but lying between 20\u00b0 44' and 22\u00b0 29' N. lat., and between 92\u00b0 44' and 93\u00b0 52' E. long. It contains an area of from 4000 to 5000 square miles; but it is a wild and backward tract, and regular jurisdiction has only been introduced into an area of 1015 square miles, containing in 1881 a population of 14,499 souls. Roughly speaking, the Hill Tracts are bounded on the south by Akyab District, and on the west by Chittagong; to the north and east there are no defined boundaries, only unexplored jungle stretching away to Manipur and Independent Burma.\n\nPhysical Aspects, etc.\u2014The Arakan Hill Tracts consist of parallel ridges of sandstone, covered with dense forest, and drained by numerous streams. The general run of these ranges is north and south; and wherever the rivers have been forced into an easterly or westerly course, the gaps in the barriers, which formerly dammed up the waters, may still be traced. The scenery at places is very wild and beautiful, but monotonous. The K\u00faladan (Koladyne), or Yam-pang, is the chief river. Its source is unknown, but its general course (which the wild tribes believe to run for some miles underground) is from north to south. During the dry weather it is navigable 120 miles above Akyab; the tide is felt as far as K\u00fandaw (Koondaw), 15 miles higher up. Beyond this point the river is a series of rapids and shallows, and its bed is rocky. The principal tributaries of the K\u00faladan (Koladyne) are the Sala (which joins it 25 miles above Dalekme), the Rala, Kola, Palak, Kan, and M\u00ed (Mee), with the Tham\u00ed and Pe or P\u00ed. The valleys of the Palak and Kan are fertile and open, but now uninhabited. The M\u00ed is a very shallow stream; the P\u00ed is navigable from its mouth as far as the latitude of the K\u00faladan police post, and above that is a shallow mountain torrent through the country of the Mros and Kham\u00eds. The Le-mro rises some distance north of Dalekme, in the Eastern Yoma Hills, the watershed between Arakan, Pegu, and Upper Burma. After a southerly course of 60 miles it is joined by the P\u00ed from the\neast, and, turning westward, receives the waters of the O from the north. Its course thence, until it reaches the Bay of Bengal, is very tortuous. The Le-mro is unnavigable; being silted up at its mouth, the tide is felt for only a few miles. In the rains, the current is very rapid. Its chief tributaries are the Pfn or Wakrein, the R\u00fa (Roo), Wet, and Sin. The wild animals found in this District include the elephant, rhinoceros, bison, deer, goat, tiger, bear, monkey, etc. The domestic animals are the gayal, buffalo, ox, goat, pig, and dog. The timber-trees are ironwood, teak, kamaung, thit-ka-do, ye-ma-nay (Gmelina), theng-ga-net (Hopea), mee-gyaung-ye (Pentaptera glabra), ka-gyneng (Dipterocarpus levis). Bamboos are very plentiful throughout the Hill Tracts.\n\nHistory.\u2014Arakanese traditions yield little information concerning the Hill Tracts. The Burmese believe that the hill tribes are related to themselves, and frequent reference is made to immigrations into Burma via the K\u00faladan (Koladyne) route. It has been inferred that in remote ages a great Mongoloid horde passed southward from Tibet, and branched out into two streams in or near the Manipur valley. The one proceeded down the Chin-din and peopled Upper Burma; while the other followed the valley of the K\u00faladan, driving before it an aboriginal cannibal race, perhaps corresponding to the Sak-ko (Rakshasas, or demons) of Ceylon, and to the present Andaman Islanders. The more fortunate, or more hardy, of the immigrants advanced to the coast, and developed a higher stage of civilisation on the fertile maritime plains. The small communities in the hills became isolated, clung to their old habits of life, and preserved the various dialects of the present hill tribes, which disclose an affinity with the Burmese language. Their peculiar customs will be treated of in the next paragraph.\n\nPopulation.\u2014Until 1881 no actual enumeration of the population was made in the Arakan Hill Tracts, owing to the fact that the people object to stating the number of their children. In 1881, however, an enumeration was carried out over an area of 1015 square miles, comprising 195 villages inhabited by 14,499 persons, namely, 7,467 males and 7,032 females. Hindus numbered 228; Buddhists, 2,160; Christians, 15; and Muhammadans, 5. With these exceptions, the population consists entirely of wild hill tribes of \u2018demon\u2019-worshippers. The great tribes inhabiting the hills are\u2014(1) The Rakaing or Chaungtha; (2) the Shand\u00fa (almost entirely beyond British territory); (3) the Kam\u00ed or Kwe-my\u00ed; (4) An\u00fa or Kaungso; (5) Ch\u00edn; (6) Chaw or Kuk\u00ed; (7) the Mro. The number of these (exclusive of police) make up 12,701 in the returns. (1) The Rakaings or Chaung-tha (Sons of the River), 670 in number, are of Burmese stock, and speak a dialect akin to Arakanese. They are divided into seven clans, all of whom\nlive on the K\u00faladan, their most northern village being 8 miles above Dalekme. Some of these clans are said to be descended from the Talaings or M\u00fans of Pegu; one is still called the M\u00fan clan. In manners and customs, the Chaung-tha resemble the Arakanese and Burmese, but, unlike the Burmese, they prefer dingy colours in their dress. They practise tattooing to a small extent. They profess Buddhism, but spirit-worship sways their minds. The books of the Chaung-tha are written on palm-leaf-shaped pieces of rough, homemade paper; the character was originally Burmese, but now differs considerably from it. (2) The Shand\u00fa cannot, strictly speaking, be called one of the District tribes, although some of their clans live within the limit of the survey map. Very little is known about them. Their language is monosyllabic; they inhabit the tract east and north-east of the Blue Mountain, and are always at variance with one another. They are polygamous, and bury their dead; in this latter custom they differ from the other tribes. (3) The Kam\u00eds number 8143, and are the most numerous tribe of the District. Three or four generations ago they lived in the mountains to the north-east, but having quarrelled with the Shand\u00fas, their neighbours, they were driven towards the K\u00faladan. They are divided into clans, each of which keeps apart in villages of its own, under a hereditary taung-meng, or hill chief. The word \u2018Kam\u00ed\u2019 means \u2018man\u2019; their Burmese name, \u2018Kwe-myi\u2019 (from kwe, a dog, and myi, tail), was given on account of the peculiarity of their dress, which hangs down behind like a tail. In features, language, and manners, the Kam\u00eds resemble the Burmese; in character they are wary and deceitful, but will always trust those of whose fidelity they are once convinced. They, of all the tribes, are most open to improvement, and fully understand the benefits of peace and trade. (4) The Mros, 1844 in number, live on the M\u00ed and on some streams to the south, and are looked upon as an inferior race. Formerly they used to construct a nest, as nearly musket-proof as they could, in some high tree connected with the ground by a bamboo ladder, to which they fled when attacked, cutting down the ladder after their refuge was gained. The establishment of British authority freed the tribe from danger, and the custom has died out. (5) The An\u00fas live in inaccessible villages east of Dalekme, and on the Sala river. Little is known of them except that they dress like the Kam\u00eds, but speak a distinct dialect. (6) The Ch\u00edn\u00eds, 980 in number, are the most widely spread tribe, and inhabit the Arakan Yoma Hills east of the Le-mro river. All acknowledge that they are of the same family, but there is a great difference between the dialects of those brought captive from the east and of those inhabiting the mountain range. The practice of tattooing the women is peculiar to this tribe. Generally speaking, the Ch\u00edn\u00eds are shy and averse to improvement. Each clan\ninhabits a tract of forest sufficiently large to supply it with cultivation. Their language, though not understood by the Mro or Kam\u00ed tribes, possesses many words in use among the two latter races. (7) The Chaws (587) inhabit a small village on the Sala river, and are undoubtedly of the Kuk\u00ed family, although it is not known how they separated from the main body.\n\nThe hill races have many religious beliefs, domestic customs, and laws in common. Their tribal religion is spirit-worship. Its rites chiefly consist of bloody sacrifices to the spirits of the hills and rivers, in order to avert evil. There are two great annual ceremonies for the propitiation of the Ka-ni or spirits, viz. at seed-time and before harvest. Another annual feast is held in honour of departed spirits or hpalaiv. This last custom is followed by the Kam\u00eds and Chaung-thas, but not by the Mros. The ceremony consists in opening the dead-house and placing food and a-m\u00fa (liquor made from rice) near the ashes of the departed. The prevailing languages are Arakanese and Kam\u00ed. The hill tribes have a very ancient system of law, criminal and civil. Their code punishes murder by a fine of two slaves, several spears, swords, and gongs, worth altogether about \u00a360; all other offences or injuries are in like manner punishable by fine only. The one offence not expiable by fine is murder upon a raid. Such murderers, when caught red-handed, are beheaded, and their heads are stuck up in the village. Trial by ordeal is resorted to. The tribes under our authority have, of course, been liberated from the worse features of their ancient code. The houses of all the tribes are constructed of bamboos, and are generally raised 5 or 6 feet from the ground. Villages are built in a rough circle, wherever the ground permits, with the slaughter-posts and a shed for travellers, also used as a forge, in the centre. The chief men have detached buildings for the accommodation of strangers. Sexual intercourse is free before matrimony; divorce is easy. Marriage is a simple contract; the bridegroom makes valuable presents to the girl's parents as dowry, but receives them back in case of divorce arising from the wife's misconduct. The succession to property rests exclusively in the males; a woman cannot inherit, and is not responsible for debt. Fines for offences cannot be paid to a woman, but go to her nearest male relative.\n\nAgriculture, etc. \u2014 Cultivation is conducted on the simple nomadic system known as taungya in Burma, and j\u00edm in Chittagong (see Akvab District). The only agricultural implements used are an iron chopper, about 12 inches long and 3 inches broad at the end, and a small iron axe or 'celt,' both fixed into bamboo handles. Seed is sown broadcast. During the rains, rice and sesamum are planted on the same plot of ground. Cotton and tobacco are the other staple products. The cotton is much sought after by the Arakanese; it is inferior to Egyptian,\nbut yields a larger crop, reported to be better than the ordinary Bengal cotton. Tobacco is cultivated by all the villagers on the K\u00faladan, and the leaf is of remarkably good quality. It is sown broadcast on alluvial deposits along the banks after the fall of the river. The regularly cultivated area is very small as compared with the population. In 1881 it was estimated at only 18 square miles for a population of 14,499; about 2500 acres of this area were under cotton, and 4000 under tobacco. Except in the taungya plots, there is very little rice cultivation\u2014principally on the plain near Myaung-taung, at the foot of the hills. In 1880-81, only 18 square miles were returned as cultivated by the plough, of which about 10 were under rice. The rate of assessment per acre is 12 ann\u00e1s (1s. 6d.). The nomadic system of tillage by jungle-burning still feeds the majority of the people. Rice is grown in the jum or taungya clearings, but no measurements are made or rate fixed per acre, each family being charged 1 rupee (2s.) a year. The number of taungya patches was returned in 1881-82 at 6636, but they are gradually decreasing in number, and giving way to plough cultivation. The women do most of the taungya cultivation, except the work of cutting down the jungle.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014The only manufactures are the weaving of cotton cloth and basketmaking. The blankets woven by the Kam\u00eds are generally white, and have thick ribs of cotton run in to make them warm; some are like large Turkish towels. The Mros usually weave blankets with a black and white pattern, showing only on one side. The Ch\u00edn\u00eds weave them in broad stripes of bright colours, like those worn by the Taung-th\u00fas. Long earthenware pots are made by the Ch\u00edn\u00eds on the Le-mro river; they are covered with cane network, and have a wide ring for the base. The trade on the Le-mro amounts to \u00a31200, and the principal exports are bamboos and sesamum. The imports are miscellaneous goods. On the P\u00ed river there is a trade to the value of about \u00a3800, in tobacco, cotton, sesamum, and miscellaneous goods. In 1868, it was estimated that \u00a38000 worth of produce annually found its way to Akyab, nearly the whole of it from the Kam\u00ed tribe on the K\u00faladan river. In 1875-76, the exports from the K\u00faladan, exclusive of coin, amounted to \u00a38707, consisting chiefly of tobacco, \u00a32846; cotton, \u00a3332; oil-seeds, \u00a3300; bamboos, \u00a3322; and plantains, \u00a3112. The export season for cotton is from December to March. This is sold by the basket of 30 local sers, being little more than 40 lbs. The usual price is 2 rupees (4s.) a basket, which would make the price of a maund of 80 lbs. about 4 rupees (8s.). The whole of the salt used in the District is brought from Ramr\u00ed (Ramree). The price is 1 rupee for from 4 to 5 baskets (12 sers). The Shand\u00fas obtain their salt by water from the villagers near the frontier, who make very large profits from the trade. All the other trans-frontier\ntribes are dependent on the British Government for their supplies of salt.\n\nAdministration, etc.\u2014A capitation tax was formerly charged on the Mros and Chins living near the borders of Akyab District, and on the Chaung-thas generally. The rates were 2 rupees (4s.) for married men, and 1 rupee (2s.) for widowers; bachelors were exempted. This tax has since been abolished, and tribute has been levied at the rate of 1 rupee per family. The other sources of revenue are the land, timber duty, and fines. A tax of 1 rupee is levied, as in other parts of Arakan, on all ironwood trees felled. The revenue derived from this jungle tract is merely nominal. In 1869-70, the total revenue was only \u00a3370; in 1875-76, \u00a3680; and in 1881-82, \u00a3683, while the mere cost of District officials and police in the latter year was \u00a35272. In 1865, in order to bring the mountainous region in the north of Arakan under better control, and to civilise the wild inhabitants, it was removed from the jurisdiction of Akyab, and erected into a separate District, under the name of the Arakan Hill Tracts, now called Northern Arakan. In 1868, a market was established at Myauktaung, with a view of encouraging trade with the hill tribes, and of winning them over to more peaceable intercourse with the people of the plains. This market, which was far enough in the hills to attract the hill people, and not too remote for traders from Akyab, has proved a great success. The hill produce is disposed of here instead of being, as formerly, exchanged for other goods with itinerant hucksters, who could not be prevented from carrying about arms, gunpowder, etc., for sale or barter. There are two judicial officers in the District, both exercising civil and criminal powers, viz. the Superintendent and the Assistant-Superintendent. On the K\u00faladan, the limit of the real power of control of the Superintendent is 20 miles north of Dalekme; beyond this, there are only one or two villages, and then comes an uninhabited country stretching away northwards. On the M\u00ed, his control is only felt a mile or two beyond the police post at the junction of the rivers Tham\u00ed and M\u00ed. Until a regular boundary is laid down, the actual limits of the District and of the jurisdiction of the Superintendent cannot be fixed. This official, as ex officio superintendent of police, directs a force of 256 strong, of whom 81 are Gurkhas or Tipperahs, 50 Kam\u00eds, 32 Manipur\u00eds, 25 R\u00e1jbans\u00eds, and the remainder chiefly Arakanese and local tribesmen; 100 of them are armed with muzzle-loading cavalry carbines, the remainder have the old Brown Bess. The police are posted at ten stations, of which eight are stockaded with upright posts, 6 feet apart, and a cheveux-de-frise of sharpened bamboos. The inspectors of police are Europeans, and 76 of the men belong to the Hill Tracts. They constitute a quasi-military force, whose duty is to repel raids from outside, and keep order among\nthe tribes within our administrative boundary. The whole length of the north-east frontier from Dalekme to Prinwa is regularly patrolled once a week during the raiding months. It requires strong and hardy men to stand the climate and the work incidental to the police of these hills, and the annual admissions to hospital average 84 per cent. a year of the total strength. In 1875 the stockade at Dalekme was removed from the bank of the river to the top of a small neighbouring hill. Guard-houses have recently been built at Sam\u00ed, and on the Kan and P\u00ed rivers.\n\nClimate.\u2014Fevers are very prevalent; but a late Superintendent writes that the deadliness of the climate has been overstated. He attributes the hill fever to the severe changes of temperature rather than to malaria. The dangerous months are April, May, and June; April is sultry, and May and June are the beginning of the rains. The people are as a rule healthy, but subject to skin diseases. What most affects Europeans is want of proper food. Beef and mutton cannot be procured. The Arakanese lowlanders do not stand the climate well, and it is fatal to most Burmese. From December to March the prevailing wind is north, and during the monsoon south and south-west. Annual rainfall, 118 inches. [For further details, see the British Burma Gazetteer, 2 vols., 1879 and 1880; the Burma Census Report of 1881; Administration Reports for 1880 to 1883. The article on the Arakan Hill Tracts in the British Burma Gazetteer is based on a Report by R. F. St. John, Esq., 1872; and since then an admirable account has been written of them by Major Gynne Hughes, lately Superintendent of the District, under the title of The Hill Tracts of Arakan, printed 1881.]\n\nArakan Yoma, or Roma.\u2014A range of hills forming the eastern boundary of Bengal and of Arakan, stretching from the great mass of mountains in the N\u00e1g\u00e1 country and Manipur, and thence spreading out westward to Tipperah, Chittagong, and Northern Ar\u00e1k\u00e1n, in a broad succession of unexplored and forest-covered spurs. Contracting to a more defined and better known chain, this range passes southwards under the name of the Arakan Yoma-daung, till, 700 miles from its origin in the N\u00e1g\u00e1 wilds, it sinks into the sea at Cape Negrais, its last bluff crowned by a golden-topped pagoda gleaming far to seaward.\n\nThe loftiest points of the range are at its northern extremity, on the confines of Manipur; farther south the height diminishes; but where it enters Arakan in the extreme north, the elevation again becomes considerable, culminating in the Blue Mountain, 7100 feet above sea level. There it throws off a mass of spurs and cross-spurs in all directions, densely wooded and completely filling the country. The most important extends westward to the coast at A-ngu Maw, and forms the watershed between the Naaf and the Ma-y\u00fa. Though of no great\nelevation for some distance from the coast, the steepness of the slopes renders these hills impracticable, except by the regular passes. The most northern is the Dalet pass, which, however, is but little used, as water is scarce, and the ascents and descents are almost precipitous. The next pass going southwards is from the village of An or Aeng, on the river of the same name, in Kyok-hpy\u00fa District, leading to Min-b\u00fa and Sin-by\u00fa-gy\u00fan, both on the Irawadi river in Upper Burma. The distance between An and Min-b\u00fa is 100 miles, or 10 marches; and between An and Sin-by\u00fa-gy\u00fan, 125 miles, or 12 marches. For some distance the road goes over a level country and crosses the An at four fords. Leaving this level ground, the road passes up the sloping face of a massive spur which stretches nearly in a westerly direction at right angles from the central ridge. The summit of the pass, 4663 feet above sea level, is 31 miles from An village, the last 18 miles being a steep ascent. The descent on the eastern side to the Kin stream in Independent Burma is much more precipitous. For 20 miles beyond the Kin, the road passes over the bed of the Man river, a mountain torrent which flows through a defile varying from one to five hundred yards in breadth at the place where the road emerges, and forks off to Sin-by\u00fa-g\u00fan and Min-b\u00fa, over a level and thinly-wooded country. From Taung-g\u00fap, in Sandoway, a made road crosses the hills to Padaung in Prome District. South of these are other passes, of little or no importance, and used only by local traders. They are generally mere footpaths along the bed of a torrent, with occasional short cuts across intervening spurs, practicable only for a pack animal or a pedestrian.\n\nIn 1868, an endeavour was made to establish a sanatorium in these hills at Myaung-gy\u00fa, on the road across the Taung-g\u00fap pass, 15 miles beyond Naung-kyi-dauk, and about 2000 feet above sea level. Although the thermometer rarely rose above 83\u00b0 F. in April, the result proved unfavourable. The invalids sent there received little or no benefit. Water is scarce within any convenient distance; and the site, besides being below the fever line, proved too damp and chilly for comfort in the cold season, and too wet in the rains. For an account of the various tribes inhabiting these mountains, see Arakan Hill Tracts.\n\nAr\u00e1kere.\u2014Hobli in Ashtagr\u00e1m t\u00e1luk, Mysore District, Mysore State.

Chief town, Ar\u00e1kere, population 2660.\n\nAral River.\u2014One of the channels by which Lake Manchhar (in Kar\u00e1chi District) discharges its water into the Indus; 12 miles long, and navigable throughout. Lat. 26\u00b0 22' to 26\u00b0 27' N., long. 67\u00b0 47' to 67\u00b0 53' E. With the Nara and Lake Manchhar, the Aral forms a continuous waterway, running for above 100 miles nearly parallel to the Indus; and as the current is at all times very moderate, this channel\nused to be more frequented during the flood season than the main stream, but in consequence of sluices and bridges on the Nara, the passage of large boats is no longer possible. There is a small railway station of the Indus valley line called 'Bandar Station,' on the banks of the Aral at Sehw\u00e1n. Goods arrive in large quantities here for export to Upper and Lower Sind.\n\n**Arameri.**\u2014Village in the Yedenalkn\u00e1d t\u00e1luk, Coorg. Population (1881) 1108.

Formerly the seat of a tahsild\u00e1r's court, which was removed to R\u00e1ipur town in 1863. It still contains a large number of commercial residents, and a considerable trade in metal vessels is carried on. Anciently one of the seats of the Haihai Bans\u00ed R\u00e1jput Dynasty, with ruins of temples and old tanks, and extensive remains of ancient brick buildings north of the present town, which is surrounded by immense groves of mango trees. Dispensary.\n\n**Araraj.**\u2014Village in Champ\u00e1r\u00e1n District, Bengal. Lat. 26\u00b0 33' 30'' N., long. 84\u00b0 42' 15'' E.

Population (1881), 401,679; namely\u2014males, 201,415, and females, 200,264; average density of population, 384\u00b775 per square mile; persons per village, 459; persons per occupied house, 6\u00b719. Classified according to religion, the population consisted of\u2014Hindus, 279,211; Muhamm\u00e1dans, 122,447; and Christians, 21. The Sub-division is divided into the three th\u00e1n\u00e1s, or police circles, of Arariy\u00e1, Mati\u00e1ri, and R\u00e1n\u00edganj, with four outpost stations; strength of regular police, 80 men; rural police or chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs, 1044. One magisterial and one revenue court.\n\n**Arariy\u00e1.**\u2014Small village on the Pan\u00e1r river, in Purniah District, Bengal, and head-quarters of Arariy\u00e1 sub-division.

It branches, in lat. $10^\\circ 56'$ N., long. $79^\\circ 22'$ E., from the right bank of the main stream, and, after flowing nearly due east for 40 miles through a rich plain, falls into the sea at Karik\u00e1l (lat. $10^\\circ 55'$ N., long. $79^\\circ 56'$ E.). It irrigates upwards of 60,000 acres, yielding an annual revenue of \u00a331,675.\n\n**Araun.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 of Gwalior State, held in j\u00e1gir, under the G\u00fana (Goona) sub-Agency in Gwalior territory, Central India.\n\n**Arav\u00e1-K\u00farich\u00ed.**\u2014Village in Coimbatore District, Madras Presidency. Lat. $10^\\circ 46' 30''$ N., long. $77^\\circ 57'$ E.; houses, 788; population (1881) 3585\u2014namely, Hindus, 2586; Muhammadans, 900, chiefly of the Labhay sect; and Christians, 99. Situated 18 miles south-west of Kar\u00far, on the road from that station to Dindigal. Pallapatti, the large Labhay village (formerly included with Arav\u00e1-K\u00farich\u00ed), has recently been detached from it, and made a separate village. It is the headquarters of a considerable trade in hides, leather, cloth, etc., carried on by the Labhay traders, who are often well-to-do. Population (1881) 6351\u2014namely, Hindus, 1643; Muhammadans, 4708. A fort, built here by the Mysore R\u00e1j\u00e1, and known to the Muhammadans as Bijamangal, was on three occasions\u20141768, 1783, and 1790\u2014forcibly occupied by British troops. On the last occasion the fortifications were destroyed, and the site made over to the p\u00e1leg\u00e1r of Andipatti. Station of a deputy t\u00e4h\u015bild\u00e1r, and a sub-registrar.\n\n**Ar\u00e1valli Hills.**\u2014A range of mountains running for 300 miles in a north-easterly direction through the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na States and the British District of Ajmere-Merw\u00e1ra, situated between lat. $25^\\circ$ and $26^\\circ 30'$ N., and between long. $73^\\circ 20'$ and $75^\\circ$ E. They consist of a series of ridges and peaks, with a breadth varying from 6 to 60 miles, and an average elevation of 1000 to 3000 feet. Their highest point is Mount Abu, 5653 feet, an isolated outlier at the south-western extremity of the range. The geology belongs to the primitive formation\u2014granite, compact dark-blue slate, gneiss, and syenite. Colonel Tod remarks upon the dazzling white effect of the peaks\u2014an effect produced, not by snow, as among the Him\u00e1laya, but by enormous masses of vitreous rose-coloured quartz. On the north, their drainage forms the L\u00fani and Sakhi rivers, which fall into the Rann of Cutch (Kachchh). To the south, the drainage supplies two distinct river systems, one of which debouches in comparatively small streams on the Gulf of Cambay, while the other unites to form the Chambal river, a great southern tributary of the Jumna (Jamun\u00e1), flowing thence by the Ganges into\nthe Bay of Bengal on the other side of India. The Ar\u00e1valli Hills are for the most part bare of cultivation, and even of jungle. Many of them are mere heaps of sand and stone; others consist of huge masses of quartz piled upon each other. The valleys between the ridges are generally sandy deserts, with an occasional oasis of cultivation. At long intervals, however, a fertile tract marks some great natural line of drainage, and in such a valley, Ajmere City, with its lake, stands conspicuous. The hills are inhabited by a very sparse population of Mers (Mhairs), an aboriginal race. (See Ajmere-Merwara.) The main range sends off rocky ridges in a north-easterly direction, which from time to time reappear in the form of isolated hills and broken rocky elevations nearly as far as Delhi. [See the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na Gazetteer, edited by Sir Alfred Lyall.]\n\nAr\u00e1zi.\u2014Village in the Sehw\u00e1n t\u00e1luk, Kar\u00e1chi (Kurrachee) District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 26\u00b0 28' N., long. 67\u00b0 49' E.; population under 2000, mainly agricultural. The Muhammadans are chiefly Sayyids and Chand\u00ed\u00e1s; and the Hind\u00fas, mainly Br\u00e1hmans and Loh\u00e1\u00f1os). Head-quarters station of a tap\u00e1d\u00e1r.\n\nArcot.\u2014T\u00e1luk in North Arcot District, Madras Presidency. Area 432 square miles, containing 1 town and 301 villages, of which 7 are held as in\u00e1m, or revenue-free. Length of t\u00e1luk east to west, 35 miles; breadth, 12 miles. Houses, 19,579; population (1881) 147,388, being 72,607 males and 74,781 females. The soil is poor, and besides limestone there are no minerals, even building stone being scarce. Fish are caught in large quantities in the M\u00e1mand\u00far and Kalavai tanks. Agriculture, weaving, and tanning are the only important industries. Land revenue (1882-83), \u00a334,496.

Lat. 12\u00b0 55' 23\" N., long. 79\u00b0 24' 14\" E. Situated 65 miles from Madras, and 5 from the Arcot Railway Station of the Madras Railway, on the right bank of the P\u00e1l\u00e1r. Head-quarters of Arcot t\u00e1luk, containing sub-magistrate's court, post-office, sub-jail, and Government school. Formerly the capital of the Naw\u00e1bs of the Karnatic, but now of small importance. Beyond some exportation of rice to the west coast, there is no trade; and, the manufacture of bangles excepted, the town possesses no special industry. Its trade, however, continued large for some years, and much gold lace and chintz were here manufactured and sold, until its young rival, W\u00e1l\u00e1j\u00e1pet, only three miles distant, began slowly to draw away its commerce. Historically, Arcot is of great interest, but few traces of its former power remain. In 1712, in order to facilitate operations against Mysore, Sa\u00e1dat-ull\u00e1-Kh\u00e1n, commanding\nthe Delhi forces, transferred his head-quarters to Arcot. For the twenty years of his power, and during the reign of his successor Dost Ali, it remained the seat of government. But in 1740, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 army of Hoj\u00ed Bhonsl\u00e1 overran the District; Dost Ali was killed in battle, and Arcot became the centre of the strife. Sabdar Ali, who succeeded Dost Ali, was murdered in 1742; and his successor, Sayyid Muhammad, shared the same fate in 1744. During the next seven years Arcot changed hands as many times; and in 1751, an English garrison occupied the fort. The capture and brilliant defence of Arcot by Clive are among the most remarkable feats of the British arms in India. On the 25th August 1751, Clive with his small force of 200 Europeans (including 8 officers) and 300 native troops, with 8 field-pieces, left Madras, and five days later encamped within 10 miles of Arcot, during a severe tempest of lightning, thunder, and rain. Of the eight officers with the force, four, including Clive, had recently been 'writers' in the Company's service, and only two out of the eight had ever been in action. The undaunted demeanour of this small army during the storm gave the enemy's spies such an idea of the valour of the British, that they hurried panic-stricken to Arcot, and so demoralised its garrison that they abandoned the fort. The next morning Clive arrived at the town, and meeting with no opposition took possession of the citadel. On the news of the capture of his capital reaching Ch\u00e1nda S\u00e1hib, Naw\u00e1b of the Karnatic, he detached 4000 of his own troops, with 150 of the French, under the command of his son R\u00e1j\u00e1 S\u00e1hib, to recapture the fortress. R\u00e1j\u00e1 S\u00e1hib invested the fort on the 23rd September with 120 Europeans, 2000 regular native troops, 300 cavalry, and 5000 irregular foot soldiers. There were but 60 days' provisions in the fort, but fortunately plenty of water. Breaches made by day in the ruined old battlements (a mile in circumference) were untiringly repaired during the night, during a siege of 50 days. Within the fort had been found an enormous piece of ordnance, discharging a 72-lb. ball. It was said to have been drawn by a thousand yoke of oxen all the way from Delhi. Clive succeeded in erecting this monster on the highest of the fort towers; and from this position it was fired once each day at the palace of the Naw\u00e1b, while R\u00e1j\u00e1 S\u00e1hib and his officers were assembled in a council of war. On the fourth day the cannon burst, but fortunately without doing any damage, as the precaution had been taken of always firing it by means of a train. This accident emboldened the besiegers, who raised a mound at a short distance from the walls, commanding the whole of the interior of the fort. On this mound they placed a small but powerful battery. The work was allowed to proceed to completion, when Clive opened fire with such success that within an hour the mound was a heap of ruins, and the 50 men who had been on it were all either killed or disabled. Attempts meanwhile made from\nMadras to relieve the garrison proved unsuccessful. Assistance, however, appeared from an unexpected quarter. Some Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 cavalry, under a leader named Mor\u00e1ri R\u00e1o, who had hitherto remained neutral, waiting the turn of events, on hearing the news of Clive's gallant defence, announced their readiness to come to his aid. R\u00e1j\u00e1 S\u00e1hib, in view of this threatened danger, summoned Clive to surrender, but his message met with a contemptuous refusal. An offer of a present of money was then made, and indignantly refused. Seeing no prospect of a surrender, R\u00e1j\u00e1 S\u00e1hib resolved to adventure an assault, which took place on November the 14th. The result is thus described by Macaulay:\n\n'The day was well fitted for a bold military enterprise; it was the great Muhammadan festival, the Moharram, which is sacred to the memory of Hussain, the son of Ali. Clive had received secret intelligence of the design; had made his plans, and, exhausted by fatigue, had thrown himself on his bed. He was awakened by the alarm, and was instantly at his post. The enemy advanced, driving before them elephants whose foreheads were armed with iron plates. It was expected that the gates would yield to the shock of these living battering rams. But the huge beasts no sooner felt the English musket balls, than they turned round and rushed furiously away, trampling on the multitude which had urged them forward. A raft was launched on the water which filled one part of the ditch. Clive perceiving that the gunners at that post did not understand their business, took the management of a piece of artillery himself, and cleared the raft in a few minutes. Where the moat was dry the assailants mounted with great boldness, but they were received with a fire so heavy and so well directed, that it soon quelled the courage even of fanaticism and of intoxication. The rear ranks of the English kept the front ranks supplied with a constant succession of loaded muskets, and every shot told upon the living mass below. After three desperate assaults the besiegers retired behind the ditch.\n\n'The struggle lasted about an hour. Four hundred of the assailants fell. The garrison lost only 5 or 6 men. The besieged passed an anxious night looking for a renewal of the attack. But when day broke the enemy were no more to be seen. They had retired, leaving to the English several guns and a large quantity of ammunition.' Thus ended the famous siege of Arcot.\n\nIn 1758, Arcot was surrendered to the French, under Lally; and two efforts made in the following year to regain possession, failed. In 1760, however, Colonel Coote laid siege to the fort, and after a bombardment of seven days took it. For the next twenty years it remained in the hands of the Naw\u00e1b Muhammad Ali, the ally of the British; but when in 1780 the Mysore war extended to the District, Arcot was surrendered to Haidar Ali, who held it till 1783. Tipu Sult\u00e1n succeeded to Haidar's conquests, and after destroying the fortifications abandoned the town.\nthe cession of the Karnatic to the English in 1801, Arcot was included; but the descendants of the Naw\u00e1b (styled the 'Prince of the Karnatic') still hold property in the neighbourhood of the town. The palace is now a ruin, and of the fort hardly a trace remains. Between the palace and the fort stands the tomb of the Naw\u00e1b Sa\u00e1dat-ull\u00e1 Kh\u00e1n, for the decoration of which and the performance of religious ceremonies a monthly allowance is made by Government. Close to the tomb is the principal mosque, the Jam\u00e1 Masjid, and within the town are twenty-two other places of Muhammadan worship, all largely attended. There are also many other notable tombs,\u2014Tipu Auliah's among them,\u2014each of which receives an allowance from Government. With the exception of two, the temples built by the Chola king in the six forests still exist. The European station, Ranipet, is on the left bank of the P\u00e1l\u00e1r, 3 miles from the railway station.\n\n**Arcot, North.**\u2014District in the Madras Presidency, lying between 12\u00b0 20' and 13\u00b0 55' N. lat., and between 78\u00b0 15' and 80\u00b0 4' E. long.; area, 7256 square miles; population in 1881, 1,817,814.

North Arcot, in point of size, ranks eleventh, and in population fifth, among the Districts of the Madras Presidency. It is sub-divided into nine taluks and five large zamindari divisions, of which one is a j\u00e1gir; and contains 3967 inhabited villages, including sixteen towns. Land revenue (1881), \u00a3281,802; total revenue, \u00a3337,343. The town of Chitt\u00far is the administrative head-quarters of the District.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The northern and western portions of the District are hilly and picturesque; the southern and eastern, as a rule, flat and uninteresting. The range of the Eastern Gh\u00e1ts traverses it from southwest to north-east, throwing out spurs on their southern side, and the Nagari Hills run across the north-eastern corner. The former range separates what used to be called the two Karnatics, viz. the B\u00e1la Gh\u00e1t, or elevated Mysore plateau, and the Payan Gh\u00e1t, or low-lying plain country. The general elevation of this part of the range is about 2500 feet above sea level. In the south-west the Jaw\u00e1di range impinges on the District, its peaks attaining sometimes a height of 3000 feet, covered in part with dense and valuable forest. The broad valley of the Vaniambadi, or P\u00e1l\u00e1r, separates this range from the Eastern Ghats, narrowing in the neighbourhood of Amb\u00far, where the Jaw\u00e1di hills and the Gh\u00e1ts almost unite. The Eastern Gh\u00e1ts and the Jaw\u00e1dis are of gneissic or metamorphic formation, made up to a great extent of bare, rounded rock masses, with smooth, loose boulders scattered about. In the north-eastern formation, conglomerates, quartzites, and sandstones prevail; and the precipitous cliffs, rising sheer from the plains, present every appearance\nof volcanic upheaval. Iron and copper are found in some abundance, and as gold has been obtained in Mysore, within a few miles of the District frontier, it is probable that it exists in North Arcot also. Coal occurs nowhere, but lime and excellent building stone abound. The chief river is the P\u00e1l\u00e1r. It enters the District in the south-west, and, after a preliminary deflection northwards, on meeting the rise of the Jaw\u00e1di hills, assumes an easterly direction to the sea. It receives on its way two important affluents, the Cheyair and the Poiny. Smaller affluents of the P\u00e1l\u00e1r are the Amb\u00far and the Gudiy\u00e1tam. The eastern centre of the District is drained by the N\u00e1ray\u00e1n\u00e1vanam and Cortelliar (Kortalay\u00e1r). For almost the whole year the river courses are dry, the water sinking into the deep sand of their beds. Channels, however, are cut into the sand, and the underflow of water thus tapped is carried off for irrigation. This supply never fails. Forests cover an area of about 1800 square miles, of which nearly one-third belong to private owners. Of the remainder, about one-half are 'local forests;' and the actual imperial revenue from this source is only \u00a3400 a year. One reason for this comparatively small income is that the imperial forests are as yet very carefully conserved, nothing being taken from them beyond the absolute requirements of the neighbourhood.\n\nThe most valuable tree found in the forests of the District is the Red Sanders, used by the natives for cart frames, door-posts, and other purposes, as white ants will not touch it; it is largely exported in billets as ships' dunnage to Europe, where a red dye is extracted from it. The fisheries, although fish forms an item in the food supply, are financially unimportant. The fauna of the District includes the elephant, bison, wild buffalo, tiger, leopard, bear, hy\u00e6na, several species of deer, porcupine, and boar.\n\nHistory.\u2014The District of North Arcot forms part of the ancient country called Dr\u00e1vida, corresponding in part to the modern Karnatic. When and by whom it was originally peopled is unknown, but the earliest important settlers appear to have been the Karambas, who are said at first to have had no king. Dissensions, however, led them to choose a chief named Komandu Karamba Prabhu, the supposed first king of the Pallava dynasty. Little is recorded of these Pallava kings. Their principal stronghold was at P\u00faral\u00far, and Conjeveram became their most important town. In the 7th century, the power of the Pallava kings seems to have reached its height, but shortly afterwards the Konga and Chol\u00e1 kings succeeded in gaining the supremacy. The final downfall of the Pallava dynasty, and the partial extermination of the Karamba race, was effected by the Chol\u00e1s about the eight or ninth century. Conjeveram now became the capital of the Chol\u00e1 kingdom, the limits of which appear at one time to have extended to the God\u00e1vari. The Chol\u00e1 power, however, in its turn declined after several contests\nfor supremacy with the kings of Teling\u00e1na and Vijayanagar. About the middle of the 17th century the last-named dynasty also came to a close, its place being taken by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, who under Sivaj\u00ed began to exercise a powerful influence over the destinies of Southern India. Venkaj\u00ed, a half brother of Sivaj\u00ed, and the founder of the present family of Tanjore, held, as a vassal of the Bijapur State, certain Southern j\u00e1girs in the Karnatic, which had passed into his possession by the death of his father Sh\u00e1hj\u00ed in 1664. In 1676, Sivaj\u00ed, desirous of wresting these from his half brother, set out against him, and entered the Karnatic by the Kall\u00far pass in the District of North Arcot. After reducing the forts at Vellore, Arni, and other strongholds in this and the neighbouring Districts, Sivaj\u00ed became complete master of all his brother's territories. News from the north suddenly recalled Sivaj\u00ed to the aid of his ally the Sultan of Golconda, who had held his Northern Provinces for him while he marched into the Karnatic. Sivaj\u00ed left his newly acquired territories under the charge of another half brother, Santaj\u00ed, who, however, was gradually overpowered by Venkaj\u00ed. In the end, Sivaj\u00ed was compelled to acquiesce in the retention of his conquests by Venkaj\u00ed on a promise of one-half the revenues. Meanwhile the Emperor Aurangzeb resolved to put a stop to the anarchy prevailing in Southern India. In 1698, his general Zulfak\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n took Gingi, and made D\u00e1\u00fad Kh\u00e1n Governor of Arcot, under which district Gingi was included. Until 1712, the Muhammadan governors resided at Gingi, and settled the country by Muhammadan fiefholders. Sa\u00e1dat-ull\u00e1-Kh\u00e1n, who first assumed the title of Naw\u00e1b of the Karnatic, made Arcot his capital in 1712. For an account of the capture and subsequent defence by Clive of Arcot during the Karnatic war, see article on Arcot town.\n\nIn 1792, after the termination of the second Mysore war, the portion of the present District lying above the Gh\u00e1ts was ceded to the British. It was appended to the B\u00e1r\u00e1-mahal tract, and administered conjointly with the western estates of Venk\u00e1tagiri, Said\u00e1pur, K\u00e1lahasti (Calastri), and Karvaitnagar. In 1801, the Karnatic was ceded to the British by the Naw\u00e1b; and the portion of this territory lying north of the P\u00e1l\u00e1r river was, together with the above estates, formed into the District then called the Northern Division of Arcot, and placed under the Kistnagiri Collector. In 1808, the t\u00e1luks south of the P\u00e1l\u00e1r were added to the District, Kistnagiri removed from it, and the estates of Venk\u00e1tagiri and Said\u00e1pur transferred to Nellore. Since that year, the only alteration in the area of the District has been the addition of the Pangan\u00far estate. When the Karnatic was first acquired, there were in all twelve p\u00e1lay\u00e1ms or tributary estates\u2014N\u00e1r\u00e1ganti, Kall\u00far, Karkamb\u00e1di, Krishnapuram, Tumba, Bung\u00e1ri, P\u00falicherla, Pol\u00far, Mogar\u00e1l, Pak\u00e1la, Gedrag\u00fanta, and G\u00fadipati. In 1803, all of\nthese, with the exception of the last, rebelled, and a military force had to be employed to reduce them to submission. Four p\u00e1lay\u00e1ms\u2014Pol\u00far, Mogar\u00e1l, Pak\u00e1la, and Gedrag\u00fanta\u2014were resumed by Government, and the rest, G\u00fadipati excepted, were for many years held under attachment. Several towns in the District, notably Arcot, Vellore, and Chendragiri, have interesting historical associations, dating from the negotiations of 1640 with the Bijapur king, for permission to erect a factory at \u2018Madraspatam\u2019 within his territories.\n\nPopulation.\u2014A Census of the District has been taken quinquennially since 1850; but the first trustworthy results were obtained in 1871. This enumeration disclosed a total of 329,844 houses (15,744 being returned as uninhabited), and a total population of 2,015,278 (or 6\u00b74 inmates per house), 1,020,678 being males and 994,600 females. The general Census of 1881 returned a population of 1,817,814, inhabiting 16 towns and 3951 villages in an area of 7256 square miles, and occupying 279,328 houses; number of persons per square mile, 251; per occupied house, 6\u00b75. In the Government t\u00e1luk divisions, the density is 281 per square mile; in the zamind\u00e1ri divisions, only 204. In point of density, North Arcot holds the eleventh place among the Madras Districts. As compared with the population in 1871, the figures for 1881 show a decrease of 197,464, or 9\u00b78 per cent., due to the famine of 1876\u201378. The proportion of the sexes is nearly equal; there were 907,354 males and 910,460 females returned; and of children under ten years, 467,740, or 227,911 males and 239,829 females. Classified according to religion, 1,717,595, or 94\u00b79 per cent., were Hindus; 82,438, or 4\u00b73 per cent., Muhammadans; 10,018 Christians, of whom 115 were Europeans and 446 Eurasians; 7761 Jains and Buddhists; and 2 \u2018others.\u2019 The Hindu population was distributed as follows:\u2014Br\u00e1hmans, 49,299; Kshattriyas (warriors), 23,563; Chettis (traders), 29,398; Vallal\u00e1rs (agriculturists), 507,928; Id\u00e1iy\u00e1rs (shepherds), 124,487; Kamm\u00e1l\u00e1rs (artisans), 47,030; Kanakkan (writers), 19,895; Kaikal\u00e1rs (weavers), 56,711; Vanniy\u00e1ns (labourers), 267,710; Vann\u00e1ns (washer-men), 27,609; Kushaw\u00e1ns (potters), 15,577; S\u00e1t\u00e1nis (mixed castes), 26,045; Shembadav\u00e1ns (fishermen), 25,976; Sh\u00e1n\u00e1ns (toddy-drawers), 24,208; Ambattans (barbers), 20,197; Pariahs, 316,025; \u2018others,\u2019 135,937. The languages of the District are T\u00e1mil and Telugu. The Muhammadans, mainly of the Sunn\u00ed sect, are most numerous about Arcot town, Vellore, and Gudiyatam, and engage indifferently in trade and agriculture, a large number being also employed in subordinate Government posts. The Labhays, a class of quasi-Muhammadans, are cultivators and traders. The Jains are most numerous in the southern t\u00e1luk divisions; as a rule, they hold land and are well off. The M\u00e1l\u00e1s or pariahs amount to about 17 per cent. of the total population, and are all agricultural labourers of the poorest class. Wandering\ntribes are numerous, the chief being the Banj\u00e1r\u00e1s, Lumb\u00e1d\u00ed\u015b, Sug\u00e1l\u00eds, Bhatt\u00fas, and Dommer\u00e1s. They travel from place to place, professing to subsist on the produce of the herds which they drive about, but eking out a livelihood by theft. The forests and hills are inhabited by aboriginal tribes\u2014Irul\u00e1\u015b, Yerik\u00e1l\u00eds, Y\u00e1n\u00e1di\u015b, and Malay\u00e1l\u00eds. These collect the jungle produce,\u2014honey, beeswax, barks, roots, soap-nuts, etc.,\u2014for barter with the people of the plains; the last-named tribe being more civilised, cultivate the soil, and trade in forest produce. They are identical in origin with the T\u00e1m\u00edl cultivating castes of the plains, but the unhealthy nature of the hills they inhabit has greatly deteriorated the race. The Christians are chiefly Roman Catholics, although the American, Danish Lutheran, and Scotch Church missions have stations in the District. Some agricultural villages established by the American mission appear to be thriving.\n\nThe population is mainly rural. The urban population is divided among the following 16 towns:\u2014Vellore, population (1881) 37,491; Tirupati, 13,232; Arcot, 10,718; Gudiyatam, 10,641; Ambur, 10,390; Wallajapet, 10,387; Kalahasti, 9935; Punganur, 7672; Chittur, 5809; Polur, 5649; Arni, 4812; Ranipet, 3697; Arkonam, 3220; Chandragiri, 4193; Wandewash, 4130; and Palmaner, 1931. Total town population, 143,907. Of the 3967 towns and villages comprising the District, 1458 contained less than two hundred inhabitants; 1390 from two to five hundred; 762 from five hundred to a thousand; 275 from one to two thousand; 53 from two to three thousand; 16 from three to five thousand; 7 from five to ten thousand; and 6 upwards of ten thousand inhabitants. Classified according to occupation, 24,647 persons were returned as belonging to the professional class, of whom 2162 were females; 12,128 to the domestic class, of whom 3738 were females; 24,337 to the commercial class, of whom 4691 were females; 659,666 to the agricultural class, of whom 214,653 were females; 154,081 to the industrial class, of whom 63,535 were females; the remainder, 942,955, to the indefinite and non-productive class, 621,681 being females. The agriculturist is strongly attached to his native village, and rarely leaves it except to attend some religious festival. The railway has worked very considerable changes, and, by raising the value of agricultural produce, has materially improved the condition of the cultivating class along the line. In the towns, stone houses are not uncommon; but all the villagers, and the vast majority of the urban population, live in mud buildings. The household furniture of the ordinary cultivator, herdsman, artisan, and small trader classes, consists merely of a bed of wooden planks (visapalaka), a bench, and a box or two.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The Government land under cultivation in 1880-81 was returned at 776,270 acres, or only one-sixth of the District area;\nof this area, cereals occupied 530,452 acres; pulses, 53,590; tobacco, 1,444; garden produce, 17,629; drugs, condiments, and spices, 5430; sugar, 9717; oil-seeds, 64,456; indigo, 11,809; cotton, 129; other fibres, 207; and starches, 555. The remaining Government land is made up as follows:\u2014Cultivable, 580,373 acres; pasture and forest land, 429,084 acres; irreclaimable waste, 878,002. The private or zamindari estates, for which no details are available, aggregate 2865 square miles. Most of the individual holdings are very small, paying less than \u00a31 per annum. A cultivator paying more than that may be called a moderately large holder, while those paying more than \u00a310 per annum are few in number, and wealthy. The average rates of assessment are 3s. per acre for \u2018dry,\u2019 and 6s. per acre for \u2018wet\u2019 land; the average out-turn per season being 900 lbs. for \u2018dry,\u2019 and 1200 lbs. for \u2018wet\u2019 land, valued in ordinary years at \u00a32, 5s. and \u00a33. Leaving out of calculation the initial outlay in cattle, the profits derivable from a holding of 5 acres average from 16s. to \u00a31 per month. The peasant\u2019s implements\u2014plough, leveller, water-bucket, and smaller articles\u2014cost in all about \u00a31, 5s.; and manure, which is generally applied at the rate of 14 loads per acre of \u2018wet,\u2019 and 20 loads per acre of \u2018dry\u2019 land, varies in price from 2d. to 6d. per load. One pair of bullocks suffices for the cultivation of 3 acres, and an ordinary yoke of cattle costs about \u00a33; buffaloes are somewhat cheaper. The chief grain crops of the District are rice, ragi, cholam,\u2014the three staples of food with the bulk of the population,\u2014kambu, varagu, karam\u00e1ni, millet, s\u00e1ma, sajja, jonna, gram, gingelli, ulandu, mochakotti, and d\u00e1l, mostly sown in June, July, and August, and reaped about four months later. Cholam is sown in April, jonna in January, and gram in September. Hemp, cotton, sugar-cane, betel, indigo, onions, tobacco, chillies, plantains, mangoes,\u2014for which the District is celebrated,\u2014and turmeric, are all largely cultivated. No regular rotation of crops appears to be observed. From rasi the people make a porridge (sankati), which constitutes the ordinary food of the masses. Rice, though sometimes mixed as a luxury with the cheaper grains, is eaten as a regular meal only by the wealthy. The wholesale prices returned in 1881 were as follows:\u2014Rice, 4s. 6d. per maund of 80 lbs.; ragi, 2s. 9d.; cholam, 2s. 7\u00bdd.; kambu, 2s. 7\u00bdd.; wheat, 8s. 7\u00bdd.; salt, 6s. 4\u00bdd.; sugar, 18s. 7\u00bdd.; cotton, 29s. 3d.; indigo, \u00a313, 4s. The agricultural stock in 1881 comprised 75,563 buffaloes, 200,995 bullocks, 190,366 cows, 4433 donkeys, 384,670 goats, 1453 horses and ponies, 23,937 pigs, 124,078 sheep, 16,720 carts, 94,677 ploughs. Live-stock varies in value in different parts of the District, but on the average a pony costs from \u00a31 to \u00a31, 10s.; a donkey, from 16s. to \u00a31; a sheep, from 4s. to 8s.; a goat, from 3s. to 6s.; a pig, from 6s. to 10s.; fowls, 6d. to 10d. each; and ducks, 7d. to\n9d. Male labourers earn from 3d. to 4\u00bdd. per diem, and females about half as much. The wages of a working goldsmith or blacksmith, of a carpenter or bricklayer, are 9d. to 1s. per day. The rate of interest for money lent on personal security varies from 12 to 36 per cent. per annum; on the security of goods it averages 12 per cent., and with a lien upon crops, 18 per cent. From 6 to 8 per cent. is considered a fair return for money invested in land.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Disastrous floods are almost unknown. On May 2, 1872, a cyclone visited the District, and caused, after a fall of 13\u00b780 inches of rain, an overflow of the tanks above the town of Vellore. Several hundred lives were lost in the inundation which resulted, and one suburb was entirely swept away. Among recent famines, the most notable, until the disastrous year of 1876\u201377, was that of 1866. Owing to continuous drought the crops failed, and relief works were kept open by Government till the close of 1868. During the famine of 1877 relief measures on a still larger scale were resorted to; and the utmost efforts of Government were required to avert the depopulation of the country. The railway which traverses the District protects it to some extent; but North Arcot does not enjoy facilities for the construction of canals or other irrigation works, and those already in existence depend upon the local rainfall.\n\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014The trade of the District consists of the export of food-grains (chiefly rice) and molasses; the import of salt, iron, cloth, and a transit trade in cotton. The exports are in excess of the imports. Weaving forms the chief industry, but the carpets of W\u00e4ll\u00e1j\u00e1pet, the reed mats (kore) of Wandewash, the brass-work and wood-carving of Tripatty (Tirupati), the hardware of Punganur, the pottery of Gudiyattam, and the glass beads of K\u00e1lahasti (Calastri), are noteworthy specialities of the District. The manufacturers generally work in their own premises on their own account, and their condition is somewhat better on the average than that of the agriculturists. There are no important fairs, but nearly every town has its weekly market for the exchange of local products. Accumulations of money are for the most part invested in ornaments of gold or silver, and very rarely in the improvement of land. The District is liberally supplied with means of communication. There are at the present time (1881) 170 miles of railway. There are altogether 1152 miles of road, maintained at an annual cost of \u00a39480. Three good passes\u2014the Kall\u00far, Moghili, and Sainig\u00fanta\u2014lead up from the plains to the Mysore plateau; the trunk road from Madras to Cuddapah passes along the first, and there is a considerable traffic over it; the second commences at a distance of some 20 miles from Chitt\u00far, the head-quarters town of the District, the main road to Bangalore and Cuddapah passing through it; the third leads\nfrom the taluk of Gudiyattam to Palmaner. The old military road to Bangalore was formerly carried through Ambur and over the Naikaneri Pass, but owing to its difficulties during the rains this route has now been abandoned. The Anna D\u00e1nam (rice-giving) chaultri at Sholingarh, where large numbers of pilgrims are regularly fed, is the only religious institution individually remarkable. Similar charities on a smaller scale are numerous. The chief religious gatherings are those held annually at Tripatty, largely attended by visitors from Northern India and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 country. An important annual assemblage also takes place at K\u00e1lahasti (Calastri).\n\nAdministration.\u2014The District comprises 9 Government taluks\u2014Chandragiri, Chittur, Palmaner, Gudiyattam, Wallaja, Arcot, Vellore, Polur, and Wandewash; 4 large zamindaris, Kalahasti (Calastri), Kangundi, Karvaitnagar, and Punganur; and one jagir, Arni. The total District revenue amounted in 1880\u201381 to \u00a3337,343, the principal items being\u2014Land revenue, \u00a3281,802, including rent of permanently settled estates; excise, \u00a331,943; stamps, \u00a319,935; assessed taxes, \u00a32737. The zamindari estates upon the rent-roll of the District aggregated a revenue of \u00a350,503, K\u00e1lahasti (Calastri) and Karvaitnagar together returning \u00a337,048. A survey and classification of the District was made in 1805 for revenue purposes, and the accounts then prepared\u2014known as the paim\u00e1ish\u2014have been the basis of all subsequent assessments. In 1808, a three years\u2019 lease system was introduced, but the experiment proving unsuccessful, the old plan of settling with the cultivators direct was reverted to in 1821. But the land had been over-assessed, and in 1857 reduced rates were promulgated. The new assessment, known as the h\u00e1l tirva, diminished the rates by 30 to 40 per cent. on \u2018wet,\u2019 and from 20 to 30 on \u2018dry\u2019 lands. In 1864, further concessions with regard to waste lands were allowed. In Government taluks, the cultivator possesses a permanent right of occupation so long as he discharges the revenue; on other estates he is a tenant-at-will. Many of the larger landholders, and all the Br\u00e1hman proprietors, sublet their holdings upon temporary leases, sometimes at money rents, more often for a share (usually about two-fifths) of the produce. There are at present 37 magisterial courts, besides 11 civil and revenue courts. Exclusive of village watchmen, the police number 1338 officers and men, in the proportion of 1 constable to every 5 square miles and every 1360 of the inhabitants. Their cost of maintenance in 1881 was \u00a319,502, or about 2d. per head of the population. The daily average of prisoners in jail during the year 1880 was 1207, the annual cost per head being \u00a37, 8s.; the earnings of the prisoners by jail labour were considerable. For the purposes of public education the District was divided, in 1881, into two circles, the Chittur and Vellore. These con-\ntain together 722 schools under official supervision, with 20,587 scholars. There are also a number of private schools not under inspection. The Census Report returned 34,994 boys and 1451 girls under instruction, besides 92,221 males and 3861 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. Total educated males, 14\u00b702 per cent. of the male population; females, 0\u00b758 per cent. of the female population of the District. The first Government schools were opened in 1826, but it was not until 1856 that the zil\u00e1 schools, giving education of a higher standard, were established. In 1868 the result-grant system was extended to all the lower-class schools, and in 1872 the administration of elementary public instruction was made over to the Local Fund Boards, established in that year.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014Malarious fever may be considered endemic in many parts of the District. It increases in severity immediately after the rainy season. Leprosy is common, and small-pox so prevalent annually from February to May, that a very large percentage of the population bear the marks of attack. In every year from 1869 to 1873 inclusive, cholera prevailed in an epidemic form; in 1876 there was another outbreak. Dengue fever was almost universal from September 1872 to January 1873. Cattle disease, in the form known as 'foot-and-mouth disease,' has been frequently epidemic. The returns for the District during the year 1880 give a mortality of 28,819, or 15 per thousand of the population. These figures only represent the registered deaths. The real mortality, however, is much higher. The registered number of births during the same year was 49,740; being males 25,541, and females 24,199. The mean monthly temperature, calculated on the returns for 1868-69, ranges from 81\u00b0 to 95\u00b0 F.; the maximum recorded being 104\u00b0 for May, the minimum 74\u00b0 for January. The annual rainfall for the eighteen years prior to 1881 averaged 33\u00b79 inches, ranging from 35\u00b772 in Palm\u00e1ner to 46\u00b78 in Wandewash; there are heavy rains during October and November. In 1881, the rainfall amounted to 55\u00b74 inches, or 21\u00b75 inches above the average.

F. Cox, Esq., M.C.S., printed at the Government Press, Madras, 1881.]\n\nArcot, South.\u2014District in the Presidency of Madras, lying between 11\u00b0 10' and 12\u00b0 25' 30\" N. lat., and between 78\u00b0 41' 30\" and 80\u00b0 3' 15\" E. long.; area, 4873 square miles; population in 1881, 1,814,738 souls. Bounded on the north by the Districts of Chengalpat (Chingleput) and North Arcot, on the east by the Bay of Bengal, on the south by the Districts of Trichinopoli and Tanjore, and on the west by Salem District. In point of size, South Arcot ranks sixteenth, and in\npopulation sixth, among the Districts of the Madras Presidency. It is sub-divided into 8 taluks, and includes within its limits the French settlement of Pondicherry. It contains 2850 villages, including 9 towns. Land revenue, 1881-82, \u00a3347,117; total net revenue, \u00a3518,565. The town of Cuddalore is the administrative head-quarters of the District.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014Although traversed along its western frontier by the Kalrayan hills, a group connected with the Shevaroys, averaging 3500 feet in height, and having on its north-western boundary the Jawadi group, the District of South Arcot itself contains no important mountain chain. From the ranges above mentioned, small rocky spurs, covered with stunted jungle, straggle down into the north and western portions, but for the rest, the District presents a flat surface. On the sea-coast a few sand ridges break this flatness, and near Pondicherri and Cuddalore high lands of laterite formation interrupt the general level; but the only elevation sufficiently important to form a feature of the District landscape is the Trinomalai Hill, an isolated mass, with a fine peak and long sloping sides covered with jungle, rising to a height of 2669 feet, and accessible only on foot. The only rivers of South Arcot, navigable throughout the year, are the Coleroon, Vell\u00e1r, and Paravan\u00e1r, but only for short distances of their length. The Coleroon, after a course of 36 miles along the south-eastern frontier, debouches into the bay about 3 miles south of Porto Novo. The Vell\u00e1r flows through the District for 82 miles, marking the southern boundary for about 45 miles, receiving on its way the waters of the Manimukta-nadi, and entering the sea at Porto Novo. Both rivers are affected by the tide for a distance of about 6 miles. Other streams of importance are the Gaddilam (or Garuda-nadi), rising in the Yegal tank, and, after a course of 59 miles, emptying itself into the sea about a mile north of Cuddalore; the Ponni\u00e1r (Ponnaiy\u00e1r), rising in the Mysore plateau, and, after a course of 75 miles, running into the bay 3 miles north of Cuddalore; and the Gingi, which rises in the Naranamangalam tank, and after receiving the waters of the Tondaiy\u00e1r and Pambaiy\u00e1r, flows into the sea by two mouths near Ariankupam and Chinna Virampatnam. The forest reserves of the District aggregate 199,478 acres, of which 103,798 are fuel reserves, and there are besides considerable tracts of unreserved jungle lands, to which vast herds of cattle are annually driven to graze, chiefly from Tanjore. From July 1882, however, a grazing fee of 2 annas (3d.) per diem for every 100 sheep, and of 4 annas (6d.) per diem for every 50 horned cattle, was introduced. The fauna of the District includes among the mammals\u2014the elephant, tiger, bear, leopard, sambhar and other deer, hyaena, wild dog, boar, and porcupine. The three first are, however, rare. Among the birds, may be mentioned the peacock, floriken, several species of game birds, and a great variety of\nwaterfowl. The principal salt-water fish are the pomfret, sole, seer, whiting, r\u00fab\u00e1l, and v\u00e1lai (a silurus); in the back-waters are found the mullet and eel. The rivers and tanks yield the marral, v\u00e1lai, shelkandai (a kind of carp), and eels. Oysters are obtained from the back-water.\n\nHistory.\u2014The English connection with the District dates from 1674, when the ruler of Gingi invited the President of Fort St. George to make a settlement in his country. Negotiations were opened, but no definite action was taken until 1682, when a trading station was formed at Cuddalore. This proved a failure, but a few months later a second settlement was made at Conimeer (Kunimedu), about 10 miles north of Pondicherri. In 1683, the Cuddalore station was re-occupied, and a branch settlement opened at Porto Novo, the deed of grant for all three being received in the following year from Harji R\u00e1j\u00e1, Governor of Gingi. Four years later, the Company purchased from the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s the site of Fort St. David (on the coast close to Cuddalore), with the neighbouring villages, and abandoned the settlement of Conimeer. The little territory was augmented in 1750, by a grant from Naw\u00e1b Muhammad Al\u00ed of two villages forming the j\u00e1gir of Chinnamanaik. In the wars of the Karnatic, South Arcot, more especially Cuddalore, played a conspicuous part. In 1758, Fort St. David and Cuddalore were captured by the French, and the fort was levelled to the ground; but two years later, Sir Eyre Coote, advancing on Pondicherri after the battle of Wandewash, re-occupied Cuddalore, the French evacuating Fort St. David on his approach. In 1782, the French and Tipu Sult\u00e1n regained possession of the town, and held it for three years, when it was finally restored, Pondicherri (then in British hands) being at the same time surrendered to the French. On the capture of Pondicherri in 1793, the French territory was placed under the Resident of Cuddalore, but three years later was incorporated with that tract into a revenue collectorate. In 1801, the sub\u00e1hat of Arcot passed into the Company\u2019s possession, with the rest of the Karnatic, and all that portion lying between the P\u00e1l\u00e1r and Vell\u00e1r rivers was erected into a District and named the southern division of Arcot. Since that date, numerous changes of area have occurred, the most important being the restoration of Pondicherri to France in 1816; the addition, in 1805, of the Mannarg\u00fadi and Chilambaram tracts; the transfer of three of the northern t\u00e1lukas to Chitt\u00far and Chengalpat (Chingleput) Districts in 1808; and of Chetpat to North Arcot in 1859. The first court of justice established in the District was that of the Choultry Justices in 1691, sitting alternately at Cuddalore and Fort St. David (Dev\u00e1n\u00e1patnam). More than a century elapsed before a more elaborate system was required. In 1802, a zil\u00e1 or District court, with its head-quarters at Virud\u00e1chalam, was established, and courts of native commissioners were instituted for the trial of small causes. Sub-judges\u2019 courts were opened in 1816 at Cuddalore, Villupuram, Gingi,\nand Sr\u00edmu\u015bhn\u00e1m, but four years later the judicial administration of the District was transferred to the courts of Chengalpat. In 1843, local courts of the first class were again established; the Civil and Sessions Court at Cuddalore, then erected, being the present District and Sessions Court. Between the years 1843 and 1881, numerous courts were opened, the total number now standing at 36, with 11 for the trial of rent and revenue cases only.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The first Census was taken in 1822, and there have been several subsequent attempts at enumeration. In 1871, the total population was returned at 1,755,817. The returns for 1881 form, however, the only trustworthy basis of calculation. According to these, the total population was 1,814,738 persons, or an increase, as compared with 1871, of 33 per cent. The population inhabited 9 towns and 2841 villages on an area of 4873 square miles; number of occupied houses, 243,773; number of persons per square mile, 372; per occupied house, 7.4. In point of density, South Arcot ranks fifth in the Madras Presidency. There were 905,771 males and 908,967 females, or 499 males to 501 females in every thousand of the population. Of children under 10 years there were 238,348 boys and 251,230 girls. Classified according to religion, 1,721,614, or 94.87 per cent., are Hindus; 48,289, or 2.66 per cent., Muhammadans; 39,571, or 2.18 per cent., Christians, among whom are included 84 Europeans and 375 Eurasians; 5261 Jains and Buddhists, and 3 \u2018others.\u2019 According to caste, the Hindu population was distributed as follows: Br\u00e1hmans, 34,555; Kshattriyas (warriors), 3542; Chettis (traders), 32,714; Vell\u00e1l\u00e1rs (agriculturists), 245,044; Id\u00e1y\u00e1rs (shepherds), 99,809; Kamm\u00e1l\u00e1rs (artisans), 41,669; Kanakkans (writers), 10,434; Kaikal\u00e1rs (weavers), 44,419; Vanniy\u00e1ns (labourers), 592,380; Kushav\u00e1ns (potters), 11,342; S\u00e1t\u00e1n\u00eds (mixed castes), 13,118; Shembadav\u00e1ns (fishermen), 19,179; Sh\u00e1n\u00e1ns (toddy-drawers), 15,059; Ambattans (barbers), 19,217; V\u00e1nn\u00e1n (washermen), 20,005; Pariahs, 427,745; \u2018others,\u2019 91,383. The Hindus sub-divided according to worship show 53 per cent. Sivaites, and 45 per cent. Vishnuvites. Classified according to occupation, 38,211 of the total population, or 693,453, are agricultural; 112,394, or 6.19 per cent., industrial; 15,324, or 0.85 per cent., commercial; 17,493, or 0.96, professional; 6799, or 0.38, domestic; 969,275, or 53.41 per cent., non-productive. The language of the District is T\u00e1mil. The Chettis (traders) are the wealthiest caste; the Br\u00e1hmans are landholders, and occupy the majority of official posts. The Korav\u00e1rs are a thieving tribe, wandering about with herds of swine, on which, and by basket-weaving, they profess to subsist. In the hilly tracts are found the Malay\u00e1l\u00eds, Irul\u00e1rs, and Villiy\u00e1rs; the first supporting themselves by cultivating forest patches, the second by the sale of jungle produce (honey, wax, gall-nuts, and bark), and the third by the chase. The Christians, nearly all Pariahs, are chiefly Roman Catholics. Three\nChristian villages established by the American mission appear to be thriving. The first Roman Catholic mission was established in 1640; in 1716, the Danish mission followed, but a century elapsed before any of the others made settlements. Among the Muhammadans of Triv\u00e1nanall\u00far is a small colony returning themselves as Wah\u00e1b\u00eds. The population is mainly rural, but a tendency to gather into towns and seats of industry is said to be becoming apparent. During the last twenty years the material condition of the people has improved. But the hut of the ordinary peasant is still of mud, without windows; its furniture some pieces of matting to sleep on, two or three brass dishes, and a few earthen pots for cooking. His clothing is of two pieces\u2014one for the head, the other for the waist. Though the expenses of a family of five persons do not exceed 9s. a month, he cannot, as a rule, support his household without borrowing. Waste land being abundant in the Trinomalai t\u00e1luk, a considerable emigration goes on, the immigrants being chiefly Redd\u00ed\u00eds and other pariahs. The same classes emigrate, to the average number of 150 annually, to the West Indies, under a system of supervision and protection carried out by the Indian Government.\n\nThe chief towns of the District are Chilambaram, population 19,837; Cuddalore, 43,545; Panruti, 20,172; Porto Novo, 7823; Tindivanam, 3526; Tiruvannamalai, 9592; Valavanur, 7231; Villupuram, 8241; and Vriddhachalam, 7347. Of the 2850 towns and villages comprising the District, 589 contain less than two hundred inhabitants, 1024 from two to five hundred, 775 from five hundred to a thousand, 366 from one to two thousand, 59 from two to three thousand, 28 from three to five thousand, 6 from five to ten thousand, and 3 upwards of ten thousand. About 49 per cent. of the total population are returned as \u2018workers,\u2019 on whom the remaining 51 per cent. depend. Of males 65\u00b764 per cent., and of females 32\u00b734 per cent., were \u2018workers.\u2019\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Of the total area of 3,125,641 acres, 1,248,561 were under cultivation in 1881-82, of which 56,071 acres bore a second crop; the cultivable but not cultivated area was returned at 1,172,908 acres, pasture and forest lands at 134,055 acres, and uncultivable or barren waste at 626,188 acres. Of the acreage under cultivation rice occupied 354,489 acres, kambu (spiked millet) 200,027, varagu (Panicum miliaceum) 245,264, rag\u00ed (Eleusine coracana) 144,209, indigo 63,779, oil-seeds 92,491, cotton 7491, cholam (Sorghum vulgare) 45,823, pulses 22,871, samai (millet) 1683, tobacco 2657, sugar-cane 3690, cocoa-nut trees 4195, palmyra trees 2520, and fruit orchards 20,074. Forty varieties of rice, samba and k\u00e1r being the chief, are cultivated. The ground is always highly irrigated for this crop. Eight varieties of kambu, the chief \u2018dry\u2019 crop of the District, and as many more of cholam, are grown. Indigo is sown in November and cut in\nMarch; sugar-cane is sown from March to May, and cut in February; tobacco is sown in December and gathered in April, and cotton is sown in August and gathered in April. The prevailing rates of assessment range from 17s. to 2s. 3d. per acre of 'wet,' and from 10s. 6d. to 1s. 6d. per acre of 'dry' land; the average rate being 10s. 6d. for the former, and 3s. 5d. for the latter. The cultivator resorts to irrigation wherever possible, for which he pays, if his land is entered on the revenue register as 'dry' land, an extra charge varying from 7s. to 3s. per acre, a deduction being always allowed where the process of irrigation entails exceptional expense on the cultivator. On an acre of land assessed at 6s., the yield of rice averages in value \u00a31, 4s., and the out-turn increases or decreases, as a rule, in the proportion of 4s. to every 1s. added to or taken from the rent. The maximum yield on an acre of 'wet' land may be taken to be 18 cwts., the minimum 120 lbs.; on 'dry' land the produce per acre varies from 6 cwts. to 96 lbs. For every 3 acres a yoke of oxen is required, costing on the average \u00a33 per pair. The agricultural implements of an ordinary cultivator cost about \u00a31, 5s.; that outlay representing the purchase of a plough, hoe, 2 sickles, spade, bill-hook, rake, harrow, and water-buckets. Manuring varies in cost from 6s. to 18s. per acre. With a holding of 5 acres, therefore, a peasant would not be so well off as a retail shopkeeper making a net income of 16s. a month. The mass of cultivators, however, hold less; and\u2014although the expenses of an ordinary cultivator, with a wife and three children, may be calculated at only 7s. to 9s. per month for the family\u2014they are, as a rule, in debt. Twenty acres would be considered a large holding; less than two acres reduces the cultivator to a hand-to-mouth subsistence. Under the favourable regulations in force, cultivable waste land is being annually taken up\u2014a considerable area for the plantation of the cashew nut. Agricultural and day-labourers, males, earn from 4d. to 5d. a day, females about half as much. Smiths, bricklayers, and carpenters obtain from 9d. to 1s. a day. Since 1850, wages have risen 50, and in some cases 75, per cent. A comparison of the prices of food-grains in the years 1850\u201351, 1860\u201361, 1870\u201371\u2014all average years\u2014shows a general rise in the second decade, with a fall in the third decade. Thus, rice selling (according to quality) at 25 and 28 lbs. per shilling in 1850\u201351, had risen to 16 and 18 lbs. per shilling in 1860\u201361, and fallen again to 18 and 19 lbs. per shilling in 1870\u201371; and cholam, which was at 46 lbs. for the shilling, rose to 27 lbs., and fell to 40 lbs. Paddy, in the same way, selling in 1850\u201351 at 52 and 63 lbs. per shilling, rose in 1860\u201361 to 34 and 39 lbs., and fell in 1870\u201371 to 45 and 50 lbs. The prices ruling in 1880\u201381 were, for rice, 4s. 5\u00bdd. per maund of 80 lbs.; ragi, 2s. 7\u00bcd.; cholam, 2s. 6d.; kambu, 2s. 9\u00bed.; samai, 3s. 3d.; varagu, 1s. 10\u00bdd.; wheat, 9s. 9\u00bdd.; gram, 4s. 4d.; salt, 6s. 7\u00bdd.;\nsugar, 11s. 7\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)d.; oil-seeds, 6s. 4\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)d.; tobacco, 21s. 3\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)d. On the 31st March 1882, paddy was selling at 18 South Arcot measures per rupee (2s.), or at 25 lbs. per shilling. Country liquor shows a reduction in price from 11d. to 3d. a gallon since 1850. The agricultural stock in 1881 comprised 85,938 buffaloes, 280,031 bullocks, 263,226 cows, 2936 donkeys, 249,868 goats, 306 horses, 2060 ponies, 14,992 pigs, 356,233 sheep, 22,462 carts, and 149,038 ploughs. Live stock have not changed notably in value,\u2014a pig costs from 6s. to 10s.; a bullock, 30s. to 40s.; a sheep, 4s. to 6s.; ducks, 8s. a dozen; and fowls, about 3d. a piece. The District contains a large number of field labourers called paday\u0101ls, of the Pariah caste, who receive payment in kind, and are, as a rule, farm hands engaged by the season, but sometimes permanently attached to the estate. The mass of cultivators are, however, tenants of Government with rights of occupancy, the holdings being terminable at their own option. On private estates, the cultivators, where not paday\u0101ls, are tenants-at-will, paying rent to the intermediate landlord, sometimes in cash but often in kind, and liable to ejectment at the end of any season. The rates of interest vary from 12 to 24 per cent. on the security of personal goods; from 6 to 9 per cent. on large transactions; and from 12 to 18 per cent. on personal security, with a lien on a crop. Five to six per cent. would be considered a fair return on money invested in land.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014Floods and droughts have been frequent. The former occur chiefly in the valleys of the Ponni\u0101r (Ponnaiy\u0101r), Vell\u0101r, and Gaddilam, the most notable years of inundation being 1853, 1858, 1871, 1874, and 1880. The floods of the Coleroon were unusually heavy in 1882, and submerged the lands of upwards of 100 villages in the Chilamaram taluk. Famine prices have prevailed ten times within the century. In 1806\u201307 Government relieved distress by large importations of grain, by the remission of revenue to the extent of \u00a362,000, and by the disbursement of \u00a323,000 on relief works. In 1833\u201334, the prices of grain doubled, and 18,000 persons were thrown on the relief works opened by Government. Remissions of revenue to the extent of \u00a316,400 were granted. In 1866, relief works were again necessary. Other \u2018famine\u2019 years were 1823\u201324\u201325, 1867\u201368, 1873\u201374, 1875\u201376, and 1877. The severest famine occurred in 1877, from the effects of which the District has not yet recovered. Relief was afforded by the distribution of food and doles of money to the weak and emaciated, while for the able-bodied, employment was found in works of utility; the total charge on this account amounted to nearly \u00a3103,210. Violent storms frequently visit the coast, and the recorded loss of lives and shipping on the seaboard of this District is very great. In April 1749, two merchant vessels and two men-of-war went down with all their crews\u2014one, the Namur, a flagship, and the finest vessel of her\nsize in the British Navy, having 750 men on board. The hurricane of October 1752 is recorded to have been the most violent remembered on the coast; and eight years later, a cyclone scattered the blockading fleet in the Pondicherri roads. Three vessels of war were wrecked, and three others, with 1150 Europeans on board, went to the bottom. In 1784, 1795, 1808, 1820, 1831, 1840, 1842, 1853, 1870, and 1871, violent storms, causing a serious loss of shipping, and doing great injury on shore, swept the coast of the District.\n\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014The list of District manufactures includes indigo, sugar, jaggery, salt, mats, pottery, oils, coir, and cloths both of cotton and silk. The salt is made entirely under official supervision. The silk used comes from Mysore; it is dyed at Combaconum, and woven at Chilambaram. In the early part of the 18th century, the East India Company established cloth factories on a large scale at several points in the District, but the industry has now much decayed. Grain, pottery, spirits, and oils, in addition to the articles above noted, represent the internal trade. This is carried on by means of permanent markets in the principal towns, and periodical fairs at various places\u2014the chief being the K\u00e1rtik festival at Trinomalai, the Ar\u00fadra Darsanam at Chilambaram, and the annual gatherings at Virud\u00e1chalam, Cuddalore, Kaillai, Srimushnam, Kuv\u00e1gam, Mylam, and Malay\u00e1nur. The export trade of the District in 1881\u201382 was returned as follows: By sea, \u00a367,700; by land and rail from and into Pondicherri territory, \u00a3414,151. Piece-goods contributed \u00a352,550; oil and oil-seeds, \u00a3170,900; grain, \u00a3145,810; indigo, \u00a321,370; hides, \u00a36850; sugar, \u00a331,730; and spices, \u00a311,890. The imports for the same year amounted in value to \u00a3105,561, of which \u00a336,650 entered by land. The leading items were\u2014piece-goods, \u00a3580; cocoa-nuts, \u00a33083; twist and yarn, \u00a33540; grain and pulses, \u00a32467; hides, \u00a37000; oil, \u00a33394; coal, \u00a314,658; timber, \u00a310,660; jaggery, \u00a344,720; bones, \u00a31080; and liquor, \u00a31390. The chief centres of traffic are Cuddalore, Porto Novo, Panr\u00fati, Ti\u00e1g\u00e1r Dr\u00fag, Tindivanam, Trinomalai, Villapuram, and Pondicherri (French). The only industries conducted by European agency are the manufacture of sugar and the spirit called arrack, the estimated annual value of the out-turn being \u00a320,000 worth of sugar and \u00a35000 worth of spirits. Strong spirit, intended to compete with spirits from Europe, is manufactured and sent to Madras and other places for sale. Of manufactures conducted by native capital, the annual values are estimated at\u2014Indigo, \u00a3120,000; oils, \u00a370,000. During the year 1881\u201382, a sugar factory, worked by steam, was established at Iruvelipat, in the Tirukoil\u00far taluk, which gave an out-turn of about 25,000 lbs. of sugar, valued at \u00a3300. Along the coast, sea fishing occupies the population of some 25 villages. The produce is for the most part consumed locally, but a considerable quantity is cured for sale at a\ndistance. The fresh-water fisheries of the District are not important, the total revenue for 1881-82 being \u00a3470. The forest products are honey, beeswax, gall nuts, and barks for dyeing, gathered by a class of people called Irul\u00e1rs, who subsist in a great measure by collecting and trading in these articles. Iron ore is found in large quantities in the Kallak\u00farichi, Trinomalai, and Tirukoil\u00far t\u00e1luk; but a company, established in 1824 on an extensive scale for working the mines, has since suspended its operations. Quarries of sandstone, blue limestone, and laterite are advantageously worked. The made roads of the District aggregate a length of 1209 miles, maintained by Government at an annual cost of \u00a314,694. The only noteworthy canal is the Kh\u00e1n S\u00e1hib, connecting the Coleroon and Vadav\u00e1r rivers with the Vell\u00e1r; it is 43 miles in length, but, being navigable only for small craft, does not carry much traffic. A length of 111 miles of the \u2018Southern India Railway\u2019 from Madras to Porto Novo, en route for Tanjore, runs through the four coast t\u00e1luk of the District; and a branch striking off from Villupuram station to Pondicherri was opened in 1882. The only institutions worthy of note are the chaultris, 210 in number, and the religious edifices, 76 pagodas and 243 mosques, under the control of the Mosque and Pagoda Committee. Two out of the five ancient sites of Siva-worship\u2014Chilambaram and Trinomalai\u2014are in this District, as also is Srimushnam, one of the eight chief places of Vaishnav-worship.\n\nAdministration.\u2014For administrative purposes, the District is subdivided into the following 8 t\u00e1luk, viz.:\u2014Chilambaram, Cuddalore, Kallakurichi, Tindivanum, Tirukoilur, Turuvannamalia, Villupuram, and Vriddhachalam. The total net revenue of the District amounted in 1870-71 to \u00a3443,108. In 1881-82, it amounted to \u00a3518,565, as follows:\u2014Land revenue, \u00a3347,117; forests, \u00a31305; abk\u00e1ri (spirits and drugs), \u00a333,402; customs, \u00a35854; stamps, \u00a318,486; registration, \u00a32725; salt, \u00a3108,998; education, \u00a3678. The total expenditure on civil administration in 1881-82 was \u00a365,047. The police force numbers 1306 officers and men, in the proportion of 1 to every 3'7 square miles and every 1386 of the inhabitants; their cost of maintenance in 1881-82 was \u00a316,980. Gang robbery was once prevalent, but it has now greatly diminished, owing to the appointment of a special officer for its suppression. On the assumption of the Government of the Karnatic by the Company, the police of the District consisted of the village watch only, presided over by local inspectors. This system was at once abolished, the police being placed under the District Judge, and authority centralized. In 1816, the control of the force was vested in the District Magistrate; and this system continued till 1859, when the new Madras Constabulary (organized on the plan of the English County and Irish Constabulary) was introduced. The history of the District Courts has already been given. The District\nis administered by a Collector-Magistrate, with four Sub-divisional Magistrates, three of whom are covenanted officers. There is also an officer in charge of the District treasury, who has control over all the sub-treasuries of the District. Over each taluk is a tahsildar, assisted by a deputy-tahsildar. The jails of the District contained during 1881\u201382 a daily average of 334 prisoners, at a cost per head of \u00a36, 9s. 8d. per annum. The average earnings of each working prisoner was \u00a34, 10s. Education is represented by 3 higher schools, 9 middle-class, and 781 elementary schools, inspected by the officers of the Education Department, and attended by 18,027 pupils. There are also a number of private schools, for which I have not received details. The Census Report in 1881 returned 32,859 boys and 1111 girls as under instruction, besides 106,004 males and 4370 females able to read and write, but not under instruction. Total of males able to read and write, or under instruction, 15\u00b733 per cent. of the male population; total of females, 0\u00b760 per cent. of the female population. There are two municipalities, Cuddalore and Chilambaram. During the years 1877 to 1881, rewards to the amount of \u00a377 were distributed for the destruction of animals dangerous to human life; the average mortality from snake-bite and wild beasts was 911, and 98 wild beasts were killed during that period.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014Epidemic cholera appeared in the District in eighteen of the years between 1851 and 1881. In 1875 the deaths from cholera were 8339; in 1876, 9544; in 1877, 25,774; and in 1878, 2066. Fevers appear to be endemic in some of the western taluks; and in the eastern tracts, leprosy and elephantiasis are prevalent. The chief drugs in the native pharmacopoeia are mercury, sulphur, arsenic, lead, bismuth, sulphate of copper, calomel, magnesia, biliary calculi of cattle, musk, safflower, orpiment, ginger, and castor-oil. The mode of treatment is in all cases the same\u2014strict diet with purges. The native doctors (hakims) never bleed nor use leeches. Medicated oil-baths take the place of blisters. In cases of delirium, stimulants are applied to the eye-balls. Cattle epidemics, which are frequent, may be classed under the three heads of rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease (kumari), and tympanitis. The average annual rainfall of the District is 35\u00b710 inches. There are 10 dispensaries in the District, of which 7 are supported from local and 3 from municipal funds, the expenditure for 1881\u201382 being \u00a32154.

This battle, with the capture of G\u00e1wilgarh (15th December) by General Stevenson, led to the Treaty of Deog\u00e1on (19th December), whereby the Bhonsl\u00e1, in addition to other important cessions, resigned all claim to territory west of the Wardha. A medal commemorative of Arg\u00e1um was struck in 1851, and presented to the surviving officers and soldiers.\n\nArhar Nawarg\u00e1on.\u2014Town in Brahmapuri tahsil, Ch\u00e1nda District, Central Provinces.

Area, 183 square miles, or 117,120 acres; land revenue, \u00a314,524; population (1881) 73,417, being 36,019 males and 37,398 females. Chief town, Arni. This *j\u00e1gir* was first granted to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Vijayanagar in the 16th century, and the grant was confirmed by the Company in 1789 at an annual tribute (*peshkash*) of \u00a31000. The present tribute amounts to a little more than \u00a3500, reductions on various accounts having been made. The estate is for the most part flat and open, with a few small hills, on one of which, Devipuram, is a celebrated temple. Contains 182 villages, of which 51 have been given away in *in\u00e1m* or rent free. The principal manufacture is weaving; the best fabrics being woven in the chief town, where they are made of a mixture of silk and cotton; these are much worn by the higher classes, and also exported to Mysore at prices varying from 14s. to \u00a35. Besides weaving, mat-making is carried on, and a superior sort of pottery, glazed and unglazed, is also produced in the estate.\nArni.\u2014Town in the Arni j\u00e1g\u00edr (estate), North Arcot District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 12\u00b0 40' 23\" N., long. 79\u00b0 19' 31\" E.; population (1881) 4812; namely, Hindus, 4177; Muhammadans, 536; Christians, 26; 'others,' 73. Situated 400 feet above the sea, on the right bank of the Cheyair (Chey\u00e1r) river, 16 miles south of Arcot. Formerly a large military station, but at present merely the head-quarters of the j\u00e1g\u00edr. The fort, now in ruins, played a conspicuous part in the wars of the Karnatic. In 1751 it was stormed by Clive, when pursuing R\u00e1j\u00e1 S\u00e1hib, after the successful defence of Arcot; and under its walls, in 1782, Sir Eyre Coote defeated the troops of Lally and Haidar Ali, capturing the fort with all the military stores lodged in it by the enemy. Here also the British army concentrated for the campaign of 1790. The site of the fort does not belong to the J\u00e1g\u00edrd\u00e1r. An imposing monument in the shape of a high column stands on one side of the old parade ground, built, as the inscription shows, by an officer of the garrison in memory of a brother officer whom he shot in a duel. At the north-west angle of the enclosure is a fine old temple, though it has no good sculpture.\n\nAror (Alor).\u2014Ruined town in Rohri Sub-division, Shik\u00e1rpur District, Sind, Bombay Presidency. Lat. 27\u00b0 39' N., long. 68\u00b0 59' E.; 5 miles to the east of Rohri. Formerly the capital of the Hindu R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Sind, and said by native historians to have been taken from them by the Muhammadans about 711 A.D. It was built on the bank of the old course of the Indus,\u2014then known as the Mihr\u00e1n,\u2014and was destroyed by the earthquake which, about 962 A.D., diverted the river into its present channel. Among the ruins is the mosque of Alamg\u00edr. There is also a cave, considered by Hindus sacred to the goddess K\u00e1lka Devi, where an annual fair is held. Travellers\u2019 bungalow.\n\nArpall\u00ed.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1 District, Central Provinces; lying between 19\u00b0 28' 15\" and 19\u00b0 49' 45\" N. lat., and between 79\u00b0 48' 15\" and 80\u00b0 11' 30\" E. long.; area, 440 square miles. Contains 81 villages, the principal being Ghot, but most of them merely small clearings tenanted by M\u00e1ri\u00e1s. The country is hilly, everywhere covered with forests, but with numerous sites for reservoirs, and abounding in perennial streams.\n\nArrah.\u2014Head-quarters Sub-division of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bengal; lying between 25\u00b0 10' 15\" and 25\u00b0 47' N. lat., and between 84\u00b0 19' and 84\u00b0 54' E. long.; area, 915 square miles; population (1881) 700,273, comprising 650,948 Hindus, 49,264 Muhammadans, and 61 Christians and others.

Average number of persons per square mile, 765\u00b733; villages per square mile, 1\u00b751; houses per square mile, 111; number of persons per village, 507, and per occupied house, 7\u00b791. The Sub-division contains the three th\u00e1n\u00e1s of Arrah, Belaut\u00ed, and P\u00edru.\nArrah.\u2014The administrative head-quarters and most populous town of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bengal; and a municipality. Lat. $25^\\circ 33' 46''$ N., long. $84^\\circ 42' 22''$ E. Population (1881) 42,998; namely, Hindus, 30,611; Muhammadans, 12,346; Christians and \u2018others,\u2019 41. Area of town site, 1216 acres; municipal income, 1881\u201382, \u00a32037. The town is well built, and has a dispensary, jail, and the usual public offices. There is a station of the East India Railway here; distance from Calcutta, 196 miles. Arrah figures prominently in the history of the Mutiny of 1857. A dozen Englishmen, with 50 Sikhs who had been sent to their aid by the Commissioner of Patn\u00e1, gallantly held two buildings, now known as the Judge\u2019s houses, against the mutineers under Ku\u00e1r (Kooer) Singh for eight days (27th July to 3rd August), until relieved by Major Vincent Eyre.\n\nThe following graphic account of the siege and defence of Arrah is reproduced in a somewhat condensed form from Sir J. W. Kaye\u2019s History of the Sepoy War. The mutinous Sepoys at Dinapur having crossed the river, marched to Arrah. There they plundered the treasury, released the prisoners in jail, and laid siege to the little band of Europeans and Sikhs, defeating in an ambush a British force despatched to relieve Arrah. Sir J. W. Kaye thus proceeds: \u2018But the little party of English at Arrah were holding out against tremendous odds. Anything more hopeless than an attempt to defend a house against two thousand Sepoys, and a multitude of armed insurgents, perhaps four times that number, could not well be conceived. The almost absolute certainty of destruction was such, that a retreat under cover of the night would not have been discreditable; but the residents at Arrah had other thoughts of their duty to the State. There were a dozen Englishmen, and three or four other Christians, and 50 Sikhs sent by Mr. Tayler (the Commissioner of Patn\u00e1), so that it was resolved that there should be no flight, but hard fighting.\n\n\u2018The centre of defence had been wisely chosen. Mr. Vicars Boyle, who was superintending the works of the East Indian Railway, was a civil engineer who had some acquaintance with military science. He was the owner of two houses, and chose the smaller, a two-storied one with a flat roof, for the defence, and razed the parapet of the other. He had collected stores and ammunition. On the 27th July, the mutinous Dinapur Sepoys marched boldly up to the attack, but were met with such a heavy fire that they broke into groups, and sheltered themselves behind trees. Herwald Wake, the Magistrate, had taken command of the Sikhs, and the little garrison resisted all attempts to overpower them, either by the fire of rifles or by heaping up combustibles, and adding to the smoke by throwing chillies on the flames. Another attempt to drive out the garrison by piling up the carcases of horses and men, so as to create a fearful effluvium, also failed, as did a\nmine which the rebels carried to the foundations of the house. A week thus passed; but when the second Sunday came round, Major Vincent Eyre arrived with four guns, 60 English gunners, and 100 men of the 78th Highlanders, accompanied by 150 of the 5th Fusiliers under Captain L'Estrange. After six weeks of heavy rain, the roads were very difficult, and before reaching Arrah, Eyre had been attacked by thousands of the enemy; but he fought his way through all obstacles until he reached the railway works. The line of railway gained, Eyre drew up his force, and the flight speedily commenced. Awed by the foretaste they had had in the morning of our Enfield rifles and our field guns, the enemy again sought shelter in a wood, from which they poured a galling fire on our people. Our want of numbers was now severely felt. There was a general want of fighting-men to contend with the multitude of the enemy; and there was a special want almost as great, which rendered the service of a single man in that conjuncture well-nigh as important as a company of Fusiliers. Eyre had left his only artillery subaltern at Gh\u00e1zipur, and was compelled therefore himself to direct the fire of his guns, when he would fain have been directing the general operations of his force. More than once the forward movements of the infantry had left the guns without support; and the Sepoys seeing their opportunity, had made a rush upon the battery, but had been driven back by showers of grape. The infantry were fighting stoutly and steadily, but they could not make an impression on those vastly superior numbers, aided by the advantage of their position. Eyre accordingly ordered a bayonet charge, which was made with a rush upon the panic-stricken multitude of Sepoys. It was nothing that they had our numbers twenty times told. They turned and fled in confusion before the British bayonets, whilst Eyre poured in his grape round after round upon the flying masses. The rout was complete, and the road to Arrah was left as clear as though there had been no mutiny at Dinapur\u2014no revolt in Behar.'\n\nArrah Canal.\u2014A branch of the Son Canal system in Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bengal. Lat. 24\u00b0 58' to 25\u00b0 41' 15\" N., long. 84\u00b0 13' 30\" to 84\u00b0 46' E. It commences at the fifth mile (from the head works at Dehri) of the Main Western Canal, and follows a northerly course, passing Arrah town; finally falling into the Gang\u00ed n\u00e1di which communicates with the Ganges. Its length from the point where it leaves the Main Western Canal to the Gang\u00ed n\u00e1di is 65 miles. There are thirteen locks necessary to overcome the fall of 180 feet between the Dehri and the Ganges.

Head-quarters of the Haruhalli taluk, and rising in importance.\n\nArundangi.\u2014Tract and fortress in Tanjore District, Madras Presidency, which in the early history of the Province played a conspicuous part. It was taken in the 15th century from the Chola kings, by the Sethupati general of the Pandia monarch, and annexed to the dominions of the latter. In the 17th century it belonged to Tanjore, and about 1646 was wrested from that State by Raghunath Tev\u00e1n. Restored by treaty, it was again captured on war breaking out afresh in 1698. Early in the 18th century, 'the important Province of Arundangi' is spoken of as the governorship of a son of 'the Kilawan' of Ramnad. The fortress subsequently changed hands many times, the Tanjore Raj\u00e1 finally occupying it in 1749.\n\nArunuthmangalam.\u2014Village in the Ramn\u00e1d estate, Madura District, Madras Presidency.

It is now the head-quarters of the Arv\u00ed tahsil and police circle. Said to have been founded 300 years ago by Telang R\u00e1o Wal\u00ed, and hence sometimes called Arv\u00ed Telang R\u00e1o. The Hindus claim Telang R\u00e1o as a Br\u00e1hman, and the Muhammadans as a Muhamadan. Both worship at his tomb, now a handsome shrine. Arv\u00ed is a considerable trading town, with a good market-place; a dispensary; a sar\u00e1i, with rooms for Europeans; an excellent municipal garden; and an Anglo-vernacular school, well attended.\n\n**Arwal.**\u2014Produce dep\u00f4t on the river Son (Soane), in Gay\u00e1 District, Bengal, 41 miles from Patn\u00e1.

Asar\u00far is identified by General Cunningham with the Tse-kia of Hwen Thsang, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim of the 7th century A.D. Tse-kia or T\u00e1ki formed the capital of a kingdom embracing the whole Punjab plain from the Indus to the Be\u00e1s, and from the mountains to the junction of the five rivers below Mult\u00e1n (Mooltan). The existing ruins comprise the foundations of the ancient palace, citadel, and city, built of large primitive bricks, some of which are moulded into ornamental patterns, and evidently belong to buildings of some pretensions. Numbers of Indo-Scythian coins are annually washed out of the soil after heavy rains. During Akbar's reign, Ugar Sh\u00e1h, a Dogra, erected a mosque on the top of the mound out of bricks derived from the ruins. Two miles north-east of the ancient city, Hwen Thsang describes a stupa of Asoka, commemorating the spot where Buddha had halted, and containing many of his sacred relics. The site of this stupa has been identified with another mound just 2 miles north of the modern village of Asar\u00far.\n\n**As\u00e1sun\u00ed.**\u2014Village and police station in Khuln\u00e1 District, Bengal; at the junction of the Sobn\u00e1l\u00ed and As\u00e1sun\u00ed rivers.

Ashti, which is said to have been a flourishing town under the prehistoric Gauli kings, was granted by the Emperor Jahangir, with other parganas, to Muhammad Khan Niazi, an Afghan noble (died 1629), who restored the town and brought the surrounding country under cultivation. He and his successor, Ahmad Khan Niazi, are buried here under handsome mausoleums in the Mughal style, lately restored. Ashti has a reservoir, a well-attended Anglo-veracular school, and a police station-house.\n\nAsin.\u2014Town in the Native State of Udaipur, Rajputana, situated 80 miles north of Udaipur. The residence of one of the first-class nobles of the state, who owns 39 villages.\n\nAsirgarh.\u2014A strong fortress in Nimar District, Central Provinces; 29\u00bd miles south-west of Khandwa, and 7 from the station of Chandni, on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway. Lat. 21\u00b0 28' 19\" N., long. 76\u00b0 20' 9\" E. It is situated on a detached spur of the Satpura range; height, 850 feet from the base and 2283 above sea level. The fort is still used as a military cantonment, and contained a population in 1881 of 2437; namely, Hindus, 1218; Kabirpanthis, 3; Satnamis, 1; Muhammadans,\n803; Christians, 166; Jains, 232; aboriginal tribes, 9; 'others,' 5. Greatest length of the fortress from west to east, about 1100 yards; greatest breadth from north to south, about 600; but owing to its irregular shape, the area does not exceed 60 acres. The fortress is terminated on every side by a bluff precipice, from 80 to 120 feet deep, so well scarped as to leave means of ascent at two places only. The approach from the north leads up a ravine, ending where the hill is highest, and is defended by an outer rampart, containing four casements with embrasures, 18 feet high, as many thick, and 190 feet long, which crosses it from one part of the interior wall to another, where a re-entering angle is formed by the works. The easier and principal approach, on the south-west side, proceeds by a steep ascent of stone steps through five gateways, constructed in fine masonry, and protected by a double line of works. A third line of works, called the Lower Fort, embraces an inferior branch of the hill immediately above the village. 'A sallyport of extraordinary construction,' writes Colonel Blacker, in his account of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 wars (1817-19), to which I owe several of the details here given, 'descends through the rock at the south-eastern extremity, and is easily blocked on necessity by dropping down materials at certain stages, which are open to the top.' The fort possesses an ample supply of water sheltered from shot range, but the numerous ravines around the base afford cover in every direction to an enemy's approach. According to Ferishta, As\u00edrgarh was fortified about 1370 by the eponymous herdsman As\u00e1 Ah\u00edr, to whose ancestors the place had belonged for seven centuries. The Farukhi princes of Kh\u00e1ndesh held it for 200 years, till it was surrendered by the last of that dynasty to the great Akbar. From that time the fort appears to have remained in the possession of the Delhi Emperors, up to the invasion of their kingdom by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. In 1803, it was taken with little resistance from Daulat R\u00e1o Sindhia by a detachment of General Wellesley's army, shortly after the battle of Assaye; but on peace being concluded with the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in the same year, it was restored to Sindhia. In 1819, it was again besieged by a British force, to which it surrendered after an investment of twenty days. Since then the fort has remained in British possession. It is generally garrisoned by a company of European troops. Several ancient guns of large size, dating from the reign of Aurangzeb, and elaborately ornamented, form splendid specimens of native gun-casting.\n\nAsiwan.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Un\u00e1o District, Oudh.

Railway station on n.-w. line of the Madras Railway.\n\nAssam.\u2014The Province of Assam lies on the north-eastern border of Bengal, and forms the frontier Province of the Indian Empire. It comprises the valleys of the Brahmaputra and the B\u00e1rak or Surm\u00e1, together with the mountainous watershed which intervenes between these two rivers. It is situated between 24\u00b0 0' and 28\u00b0 17' N. lat., and between 89\u00b0 45' and 97\u00b0 5' E. long. The total area is returned at 46,341 square miles, excluding certain unsettled and unsurveyed tracts in the hill territory of Lakhimpur, and also the surface of the larger rivers; the total population, also excluding the hill tracts, amounts to 4,881,426, according to the Census of 1881. The administrative head-quarters and the residence of the Chief Commissioner are at the station of Shillong, in the Kh\u00e1s\u00ed Hills.\n\nThe name of Assam is said to be derived from that of the once dominant race, the Ahams. It should be borne in mind, however, that Aham is not locally pronounced Asam. The local dialectical change softens the Bengali s into h, but never converts h into s. It is possible that the name Asam was given to the country or to the people ab extra, by Muhammadan invaders or Hindu immigrants, who by an opposite process might harden the aspirate into the sibilant in the word Aham. But against this theory it may be urged that the Bengali name of the Province is As\u00e1m, with each a long, while that of the race as Ah\u00e1m, with the second a short. On the whole, however, the derivation of the word Assam from the Aham tribe seems most probable.\n\nAssam is bounded on the north by the eastern section of the great Himalayan range, the frontier tribes from west to east being successively Bhuti\u00e1s, Ak\u00e1s, Daphl\u00e1s, Mir\u00eds, Abars, and Mishm\u00eds; on the north-east by the Mishmi Hills, which sweep round the head of the Brahmaputra valley; on the east by the unexplored mountains that mark the frontier of Burma, by the hills occupied by semi-independent N\u00e1g\u00e1 tribes, and by the State of Manipur; on the south by the hills occupied by the Lush\u00e1i tribe of Kuk\u00eds, by the State of Hill Tipperah, and by the Bengal District of Tipperah; on the west by the Bengal Districts of Maimansingh and Rangpur, the State of Kuch Behar, and Jalpaiguri District. I regret that the delay of the Assam Census of 1881, which had not been received when this article went to press, has debarred me from treating so fully as I should have wished of the economic aspects of this most interesting province. The figures relating to 1881 have\nbeen inserted while the article was passing through the printer's hands. But for generalizations I must refer to the admirable Report of the Census of 1881, as revised by the Chief Commissioner, Mr. Charles Elliot, C.S.I., of the Bengal Civil Service; and to his Administration Reports of the Province from 1882 to 1884.\n\nHistory.\u2014The Province of Assam was constituted in its present form in the year 1874, when the eleven Districts comprising it were separated from the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal, and erected into an independent administration under a Chief Commissioner. The tract thus united under one Government is naturally divided into three portions,\u2014the Brahmaputra valley, the Surma valley, and the intervening hill tracts,\u2014each of which in former times possessed a separate history. To the Brahmaputra valley alone, covering an area of 21,414 square miles, or just one-half the whole, is the name of Assam properly applicable. This fertile valley, penetrated throughout its entire length by a great navigable river, has always been closely connected with the main course of Indian history, though it has never formed an integral part of the vast empires which dominated at various times over the rest of the peninsula. In ethnological features and in language, as well as in history, the population of Assam is distinct from the great body of Hindus, though in recent times they have adopted the Brahmanical religion. The earliest authentic traditions attest the existence of a Hindu kingdom of Kamrup, with its capital at Gauhati, still the most important town of the Province. The area of this kingdom is said to have extended over a great part of Eastern Bengal, including the present District of Rangpur. One of the early Rajas is popularly identified with the Bhagadatta of the Mahabharata, who was slain by Arjuna. Many local legends are current concerning his successors, which are preserved in the Yogini Tantra. The best evidence of their power is to be found in the remains of Gauhati, and in the ruins of palaces and temples of hewn stone which lie scattered through the valley of the Brahmaputra as far up as Tezpur. The overthrow of this dynasty is ascribed to the Muhammadans, who occupied Rangpur for the first time in the 15th century, and sent several expeditions into Assam. A state of general anarchy ensued, out of which the aboriginal tribe of Kochs rose to power, and founded a kingdom which was at one time co-extensive with the earlier Hindu Empire of Kamrup. The present Raja of Kuch Behar, in Bengal, still represents the main line of this dynasty, and the petty Rajas of Darrang, Bijni, and Sidli, in the Brahmaputra valley, belong to the same stock.\n\nThe modern history of Assam records the advance of two opposite races of invaders\u2014the Ahoms, from the east; and the Musalmans, who, from the west, were ever trying to annex the Province to Bengal. The Ahoms succeeded in establishing their authority throughout\nthe whole valley, but their permanent influence upon the civilisation of the people whom they subdued was comparatively small. They were a tribe of Shan origin, of the same stock as the Siamese, and are supposed to have first entered the head of the valley in the 13th century. The extension of their power westwards was very gradual; and the fact that all their great towns are situated as high up as Sibs\u00e1gar District, explains the late continuance of the Koch dynasty in Lower Assam. The Ahams appear to have been a bold race of warriors, who were not afraid to meet the Mughals face to face in battle; and they also possessed a highly organized system of government, differing in several important particulars from that which prevailed throughout India. It was not the soil, so much as the cultivators of the soil, that were regarded as the property of the Aham State. The entire scheme of administration was based upon the obligation of personal service, due from every individual. Each male inhabitant above the age of sixteen years was denominated a p\u00e1ik, and enlisted as a member of a vast army of public servants. Three p\u00e1iks made up a got, and one p\u00e1ik from each got was, in theory, always on duty. A larger division, called a khel, consisted of twenty gots, at the head of which was a b\u00e1ra. Over each hundred gots was a saiky\u00e1, and over each thousand gots a haz\u00e1ri. The whole population, thus classified in regiments and brigades, was ready to take the field on the shortest notice. But this organization was not only used for military purposes; it supplied also the machinery by which public works were conducted, and the revenue was raised. Every p\u00e1ik was liable to render personal service to the R\u00e1j\u00e1, or to pay a poll-tax if his attendance was not required. As a remuneration, each p\u00e1ik was allowed two pur\u00e1s (2\u00bd acres) of rupit or rice land (known as go\u00e1mati or body-land), rent free; but his house and garden land (b\u00e1ri) were liable to an assessment varying in different parts of the country, from a house tax to a poll-tax or a hearth tax, generally at the rate of one rupee per house, head, or hearth. The go\u00e1mati or body-land was considered as the property of the State, and (theoretically) was neither hereditary nor transferable. The b\u00e1ri lands were both hereditary and transferable. The Aham princes were efficient administrators, but hard taskmasters. It was by the p\u00e1ik organization that they were able to repel the Muhammadan invaders, and to construct those great public works still scattered throughout the Province in the form of embankments and tanks. But the memory of their system of forced labour has sunk so deep into the minds of the native population, that at the present day it is reckoned a badge of servitude to accept employment in public works. Our civil officers find it very difficult to attract labour, even by high wages.\n\nThe first recorded invasion of Assam by the Ahams is said to have occurred in 1228 A.D. They appear to have come from Momiet in\nUpper Burma. The first prince of this line who adopted Hinduism is stated to be a King Chuhum-pha, whose accession is placed at 1497 A.D. The third ruler in succession to this prince, Chu-cheng-pha, who reigned from 1611 to 1649, built temples to Siva at Sibs\u00e1gar; and to him is attributed the establishment of Hinduism as the State religion. His successor (1650 A.D.), R\u00e1j\u00e1 Chutuml\u00e1, received from the Br\u00e1hmans the name of Jayadhajiya Singh. In his reign occurred the Mughal invasion of Assam under M\u00edr Juml\u00e1, one of the most skilful generals of Aurangzeb. Despite the boasts of the Muhammadan chroniclers, it is certain that this invasion proved ultimately unsuccessful, and that the Ahams pushed forward the western limit of their kingdom as far as Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1. The greatest of the Aham kings was Rudra Singh, who is said to have ascended the throne in 1695.\n\nIn the next century the dynasty began to decay, torn by internal dissension, and hard pressed by invaders from without. The acquaintance of the British with Assam dates from the year 1792, when Captain Welsh was sent with a detachment of Sepoys to restore R\u00e1j\u00e1 Gaurin\u00e1th Singh, who had been dispossessed by a combination between the Koch R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Darrang and an insurgent sect of religious fanatics called Mo\u00e1m\u00e1ri\u00e1s. Captain Welsh having achieved his purpose in restoring the R\u00e1j\u00e1, was recalled in 1794, in accordance with the policy of non-intervention then dominant at Calcutta. The head of the Mo\u00e1m\u00e1ri\u00e1s or Matak tribe inhabiting the Dihing-Brahmaputra do\u00e1b maintained an independent political existence, under the title of the Bar Sen\u00e1pat\u00ed, down to the time of the British annexation. Captain Welsh left anarchy behind him in Assam. The Aham R\u00e1j\u00e1s had become mere puppets in the hands of rival ministers, and no party in the State was strong enough to stand without foreign help. The Burmese were called in as arbitrators, and, having once established themselves in Assam, ruled the natives with a rod of iron. Whole districts are known to have been depopulated by internecine struggles, and by the barbarities and exactions of the Burmese. At length, in 1824, war was declared between the British and the Burmese; and, as an incident in the war, Assam was occupied by a British army, and finally ceded to us by the treaty of Yandabu (Yendaboo) on the 24th February 1826. On their departure from the Province, the Burmese and their allies carried with them a large number of Assamese as slaves, the recovery of whom from the hands of the Sinphos was one of the first efforts of British policy. Lower Assam was forthwith placed under direct British administration, but the upper part of the valley, except the Matak or Bar Sen\u00e1pat\u00ed country, was constituted a separate principality in 1832 under Purandar Singh, one of the pretenders to the Aham throne. In 1838, however, owing to the flagrant misgovernment of Purandar Singh, it was found necessary to annex this tract also.\nThe Districts of Sylhet and Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 had been previously acquired by the East India Company in 1765 by the diw\u00e1n\u00ed grant, with the rest of Bengal. The plains portion of Cachar lapsed to us in 1830, on the death of the last native R\u00e1j\u00e1, Govind Chandra, without heirs. British authority has gradually extended itself over the hill tracts at various times, the last annexation, that of Tular\u00e1m Sen\u00e1pati\u2019s country, being effected in 1854. The G\u00e1ro Hills were, from the first, nominally included within the Bengal District of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1, and were placed under a separate officer in 1866; but as late as 1873, a military expedition was necessary to exact submission from the independent tribes. The Kh\u00e1s\u00ed Hill States were acquired, partly by conquest, and partly by treaty, after a petty war of a harassing nature, in 1833; and the chiefs are treated to the present day as semi-independent, no direct taxation being levied from them. The Jainti\u00e1 Hills were acquired in 1835, when the native R\u00e1j\u00e1, having forfeited his territory in the plains, for complicity in the human sacrifice of a British subject, voluntarily surrendered his hill territory, over which he had but little control, and from which he derived hardly any revenue, in return for a pension of \u00a350 a month. The inhabitants, who call themselves Syntengs, or Santengs, rose in insurrection in 1862 as a protest against the introduction of novel taxes; and the rebellion was not suppressed without difficulty.\n\nAn officer was first stationed at Samaguting in the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills in 1868, but the savage tribe of Ang\u00e1m\u00ed N\u00e1g\u00e1s still cherish their primitive independence, and have frequently been guilty of bloodthirsty raids. The history of the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills District is complicated by frontier struggles. This territory was acknowledged to be British (in supersession to the rule of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Assam) as far back as 1842, when the northern frontier of Manipur was demarcated. Numerous raids by savage tribes of Ang\u00e1m\u00ed N\u00e1g\u00e1s in North Cachar have been the principal feature in the history of that tract from 1835 onwards; and in 1854, the North Cachar Sub-division was formed with a view to the repression of these inroads. In 1866, a British station was formed at Samaguting as the head-quarters of the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills, the North Cachar Sub-division being distributed between the Districts of Cachar, Nowgong, and the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills. The subjection of the Ang\u00e1m\u00ed country was gradually effected by the acceptance of the allegiance of those villages which were willing to pay a nominal revenue; and also by a succession of punitive expeditions into the hills. Eventually it became manifest that the purpose of the establishment of the station at Samaguting, namely the repression of raids upon North Cachar and Nowgong, could not be effectively served except by placing the seat of control in the centre of the Ang\u00e1m\u00ed country; and this was effected after another military expedition, and the occupation of Kohim\u00e1, in 1879\u201380. Public\nbuildings and a fort have been constructed, and a road has been made. The decision of Government to permanently occupy the hills as a British District was arrived at in February 1881, and the District boundaries finally notified in July 1882. The Chief Commissioner of Assam, in 1881\u201382, stated his belief that the feeling of the N\u00e1g\u00e1s is now one of acquiescence in British rule. In travelling through the District in March 1882, he noticed that they wore a look of greater friendliness and contentment than during his previous visit, and that they had begun to offer voluntary labour in making and clearing the road in considerable numbers. The Eastern Dw\u00e1rs portion of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 District was annexed from Bh\u00fat\u00e1n on the outbreak of the war of 1864. For a recent tribal disturbance in Assam, see article Ak\u00e1s.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The three divisions of Assam which have been already indicated are distinguished by well-marked physical features. Assam Proper, or the valley of the Brahmaputra, is an alluvial plain, about 450 miles long, with an average breadth of 50 miles. On all sides but the west it is shut in by jungle-covered ranges or lofty mountains. From east to west it is traversed by the main stream of the Brahmaputra; and the strips of land along each bank of the great river are intersected by numerous minor streams. The main stream of the Brahmaputra, although confined here and there by isolated hills, or by spurs from the great ranges, for the most part wanders freely over the broad bottom of its basin, and has changed its course many times within the memory of man. A strip of land, varying from six to twenty miles in breadth, liable to annual inundations, or irruptions of new channels, is thus abandoned to a wild overgrowth of reeds or grass-jungle, and is incapable of permanent habitation or cultivation. It is not till the ground begins to rise gradually towards the hills that regular agriculture becomes possible. The almost uniform level is broken at intervals by low conical hills, which are scattered in isolated mounds or in clusters throughout the plains. In some parts the hills throw forward spurs, almost to the river-bank.\n\nThe Surm\u00e1 valley differs from that of the Brahmaputra, in that it consists of a shallow basin, which is being filled up by the silt that the enormous rainfall washes off the southern slopes of the Kh\u00e1s\u00ed Hills. This detritus is deposited along the river banks, which are thus gradually raised above the surrounding level, and form the highways of the country. From each river the level recedes, sinking 20 or 30 feet below the crest of the bank, when it again rises to the bank of the next stream. These great hollows or river troughs, locally known as h\u00e1ors, are a peculiar feature in Sylhet. The District of Cachar is crossed by hill ranges running transversely to the main river, and in Sylhet the valley gradually expands until it merges into the wide expanse of Eastern Bengal.\nThe central hill tract between the Brahmaputra and the Surma valleys, comprising the Districts of the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills, Kh\u00e1s\u00ed and Jainti\u00e1 Hills, and G\u00e1ro Hills, forms a long, projecting outwork of the mountain system which intervenes between the watersheds of the Brahmaputra and the Irawadi. This outwork consists, not of one hill range, but of a number of ridges and plateaux, separated by deep valleys. The character of a plateau, deeply furrowed by torrents, but still having a general equality of level, is maintained throughout the Kh\u00e1s\u00ed and Jainti\u00e1 Hills, and in the eastern portion of the G\u00e1ro Hills, but is lost in the country west of the Sameswari river. The highest elevation is maintained by a plateau starting on the west from the Tur\u00e1 range in the G\u00e1ro Hills, running through the Kh\u00e1s\u00ed Hills by Shillong, then turning southwards and passing by the head of the K\u00e1pili river into the B\u00e1rel range, the two branches of which, divided by the Jatinga valley, run up into the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills, meeting again on the frontier of North Cachar. Thence they proceed in one range north-eastwards, reaching their highest point in British territory in the peak of J\u00e1ps\u00f3, near Kohim\u00e1, with a height of 9890 feet. Farther east, beyond British territory, this elevation is considerably exceeded, the maps showing several peaks over 10,000, and one of over 12,000 feet. In the Kh\u00e1s\u00ed Hills the range above Shillong rises to 6449 feet, while the G\u00e1ro Hills have no point above 4700 feet. The ascent from the plain is very abrupt, especially on the southern side of the Kh\u00e1s\u00ed ranges; and each separate ridge or plateau is marked by precipitous outlines.\n\nThe soil of the Brahmaputra valley is for the most part a rich black loam, reposing on grey sandy clay; but in some tracts, a light yellow clay appears on the surface. The mountains on the north and east are of igneous formation, being composed of primitive limestone, granite, serpentine, porphyry, and talcose slate. The Mishm\u00ed Hills, closing the north-eastern frontier, are of limestone. The N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills begin on the east with sandstone; but in the neighbourhood of Samaguting granite appears, which runs westwards continuously to the end of the G\u00e1ro ranges. In the Kh\u00e1s\u00ed and Jainti\u00e1 Hills, stratified rocks of sandstone, limestone, and shale occur; and talc in the G\u00e1ro Hills. Over the greater part of the hill tracts, the surface soil is a red ferruginous loam.\n\nMinerals.\u2014The hills of Assam abound in mineral resources, including coal, iron, and limestone. The existence of coal was discovered in 1825, and several attempts at working the seams have been conducted by European capital. The beds at the foot of the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills in Lakhimpur and Sibs\u00e1gar Districts were examined and reported upon by Mr. Mallet of the Geological Survey in the years 1874\u201375 and 1875\u201376. These coal-fields are six in number, extending over a tract of country 110 miles long, and are computed to contain an aggregate of 40 million tons. There are several small beds in the Kh\u00e1s\u00ed and Jainti\u00e1 Hills.\nThe quality of the coal in both cases is described as excellent; but the difficulty of transport has as yet prevented it from competing with the coal imported from the Bengal mines or from England. A company called the Assam Railway and Trading Company has been formed for the purpose chiefly of exploiting the M\u00e1kum coal-beds in Lakhimpur, and a railway on the metre gauge has been constructed from Dibrugarh to the M\u00e1kum field. The first rail was laid in 1881, and the line opened in 1884. The enterprise promises extremely well, and the opening out of these coal-measures is likely to add greatly to the prosperity of the Province. Petroleum is found in abundance near the out-crop of the several coal-measures at M\u00e1kum, but attempts to introduce the oil as an article of commerce have hitherto proved unsuccessful. Concessions for the working of petroleum have now been concluded with the Assam Railway and Trading Company. Iron, also, occurs along the whole line of the hill tracts. In former times the Kh\u00e1s\u00eds supplied the plains of Eastern Bengal with smelted ore and iron implements, but now the industry has almost died out under the competition of the cheaper English article, and is only confined to a few villages in the Kh\u00e1s\u00ed hills. The process of smelting is very rudely carried on in charcoal fires, blown by enormous double action bellows worked by two persons, who stand on the machine raising the flaps with their hands, and expanding them with their feet. Neither furnace nor flux is used in the process. The fire is kindled on one side of an upright stone, with a small arched hole close to the ground for the nozzle of the bellows. The ore is run into lumps which are afterwards cleft nearly in two, to show the quality of the metal. Inexhaustible beds of limestone are found on the southern face of the Kh\u00e1s\u00ed and Jainti\u00e1 Hills. From time immemorial a large part of the supply of Bengal has been derived from this source under the name of \u2018Sylhet lime.\u2019 In 1876\u201377, the total export was 37,709 tons, valued at \u00a374,000, and the revenue to Government from royalties was \u00a36726. In 1880\u201381, the export of lime by boat to Bengal was returned at 12 l\u0101khs of maunds, or about 43,900 tons, valued at \u00a3119,599. In the following year, the export of lime by river was returned at 16 l\u0101khs of maunds. It is said that gold exists in most of the hill streams, but the business of gold-washing barely supports a few miserable families.\n\nForests form a second great source of natural wealth in Assam, but they have only recently been placed under a system of conservancy protection and of economic working. Wood-cutters from Bengal have as yet hardly penetrated half way into K\u00e1mrup, and there is a vast quantity of timber to be worked in the Eastern Dw\u00e1rs, as well as in South K\u00e1mrup. East of K\u00e1mrup, the forests are practically untouched. The manufacture of canoes or \u2018dug-outs\u2019 is the only use to which large trees are put, while charcoal is the main object of demand.\nThe local requirements in the way of wood are so small, that the conservancy of the forests scarcely pays its way; and the large area of forests in private hands (disposed of as waste land grants) still further reduces the calls upon Government forests. In the year 1871\u201372 measures of protection were first adopted, and by the close of 1880\u201381 an area of 2015 square miles had been declared \u2018forest reserves,\u2019 under the control of the Forest Department, and 689 square miles declared as \u2018protected\u2019 forest. In addition, there is an area of 5371 square miles of unreserved forest under the ordinary authority of the civil officers. In 1880\u201381 the total revenue of the Forest Department was \u00a316,899, against an expenditure of \u00a314,272, showing a credit balance of \u00a32627. A net revenue of \u00a34732 was also realized from forests by the District officers. In 1881\u201382, the revenue of the Forest Department was \u00a316,605, against an expenditure of \u00a316,536. These figures, however, only show the financial results of an elaborate system of forest administration still in its infancy. The most valuable timber-trees are sal (Shorea robusta), sisu (Dalbergia sissoo), nahor (Mesua ferrea), ajhar (Lagerstroemia regin\u00e6). In the Kh\u00e1s\u00ed Hills are found the Pinus kasya, and many other trees characteristic of a temperate clime. Prior to 1881 it was found impracticable to levy any revenue from the collection of caoutchouc (Ficus elastica), owing to the difficulty of bringing foreign rubber under regulations; but this difficulty has been overcome, and in 1881\u201382 the rubber plantations were leased out by auction for \u00a32684. In the year 1880\u201381, timber to the value of \u00a372,715, and caoutchouc to the value of \u00a324,656, were exported to Bengal.\n\nAmong the wild animals of Assam may be mentioned elephants, rhinoceros, tigers, leopards, bears, deer of many kinds, buffaloes, and the mithan or gaydl (Gav\u00e6us frontalis), a wild cow domesticated by the hill tribes. The domestic animals are principally confined to common cattle and buffaloes. The former are very numerous, but the breed is indifferent. The buffaloes, on the other hand, are of peculiar excellence, which is attributed to the circumstance that they interbreed with the wild stock. Ponies are imported from Manipur and Bh\u00fat\u00e1n. The right of capturing wild elephants is regarded as a Government prerogative, and is leased out annually upon stringent conditions. The elephant hunting-grounds, which lie chiefly among the lower slopes of the hill tracts, are divided into several mahals, which are leased out, and yielded in 1880\u201381 a total revenue of \u00a36318. Government retained, up till recently, the option of purchasing every elephant caught between 6 and 7\u00bd feet in height at the price of \u00a360, and a royalty of \u00a310 was payable by the leaseholder on every elephant not so purchased. This right of pre-emption has now been abandoned. Elephants are largely used by the Forest Department. In 1881, the total number of deaths reported as caused by wild beasts and snake-bite was 250.\nPopulation.\u2014Prior to 1871-72, no trustworthy estimates exist of the population of Assam. At that time, the Districts now forming the Chief Commissionership were under the Bengal Government. The Census Report of 1872 returned the population of Assam, as at present constituted, at 4,124,972. In 1881, a second Census was taken at the same time as throughout the rest of India. The result showed that during the nine years since 1872 the population of the Province had increased by 756,454 persons, or 18.34 per cent. This increase, although to some extent owing to more careful enumeration in 1881, is mainly due to the natural increase of the population, which is approximately entered in the Census Report at 530,000, showing an increase of 13.4 per cent. in the nine years, or an average annual increase of 1.407 per cent. The remaining increase, just under 5 per cent., is attributed to immigration of coolies to the tea gardens.\n\nThe Census of 1881 was taken over a total area (in some cases estimated) of 46,341 square miles, containing 7 towns and 22,401 villages; number of houses, 860,084, of which 859,388 were occupied, and 696 unoccupied. Total population 4,881,426, namely, males 2,503,703, and females 2,377,723; proportion of males in total population, 51.29 per cent. Average density of population, 105 per square mile; towns and villages per square mile, 0.478; persons per town or village, 213; houses per square mile, 18.48; persons per occupied house, 5.57. The density of the population varies greatly. Of the three tracts comprising the Province, the Surma valley has an area of 6725 square miles, and a population of 2,258,434 persons; average density, 336 per square mile. The Brahmaputra valley, with its 21,414 square miles of area, and population of 2,249,185, has a density of 105 per square mile. The hill tracts contain an area of 18,202 square miles, with a population of 373,807, or only 20.5 persons per square mile. Thus the valley of the Brahmaputra covers an area over three times as great as that of the Surma, and yet has a less population. Its soil is almost everywhere fertile and suitable for cultivation, and could easily support a population of 300 to the square mile; so that four million immigrants could be received and settled in this division of the Province, without crowding each other, and with immense benefit to the over-populated parts of India from whence they might come. Sylhet is at once the most populous District in the Province, both as to numbers and density (362 per square mile), and is the largest in area except two of the thinly peopled hill tracts. Its population is very nearly two millions, and nearly equal to that of all the other plain Districts put together. Cachar ranks second in point of density, having 225 per square mile; the other plain Districts in order of density being\u2014Kamrup, 178; Sibsagar, 130; Goalpara, 114; Nowgong, 91; Darrang, 80; and Lakhimpur, 48. In the hill tracts, the\ndensity varies from 27 per square mile in the Kh\u00e1s\u00ed and G\u00e1ro hills, to 9\u00b79 in the North Cachar hills.\n\nThe table on the following page exhibits the area, population, etc., of each District in the three territorial divisions of Assam, as returned in the Census Report of 1881.\n\nRegarded ethnically, the population of Assam presents a great variety of races. As compared with Bengal, tribes of aboriginal or semi-aboriginal descent are especially numerous; and the distinction which the Census Report draws between these two classes is not quite uniformly maintained. There is no single Assamese nationality; the Assamese language is merely a modern dialect of Bengali. Those tribes which still remain in their native hills preserve their primitive religion and customs, and in many cases also their own language; but wherever the aboriginal tribes have permanently settled in the plains, whether as conquerors or in agricultural colonies, they have generally fallen under the overshadowing influence of Hinduism, and now rank as low-castes in the Br\u00e1hmanical system. Purity of blood, indeed, is very lightly regarded throughout Assam. Intermarriage between the different castes is common, and the offspring of mixed marriages are readily received into one or other of the low-castes. Among those aboriginal tribes who keep their nationality unimpaired, the most numerous are the N\u00e1g\u00e1s, 104,650 in number, the Kh\u00e1s\u00eds (104,830), the G\u00e1ros (112,104), and the Mikirs (77,765). The K\u00e1ch\u00e1ris also, who belong to the great Bodo race, or which there are several tribes, remain still for the most part in the condition of primitive barbarism. They have given their name to the District of Cachar; but, as a matter of fact, their R\u00e1j\u00e1 fixed his capital there within a very recent period, and the great majority of the tribe are to be found in the lower Districts of the Brahmaputra valley. In 1881 they numbered 281,611. The L\u00e1lungs, a tribe proved by their language to be closely connected with the K\u00e1ch\u00e1ris, inhabit the northern skirts of the Jainti\u00e1 hills, with the plains at their feet, and thence extend eastwards up the valley of the Kopil\u00ed river, to the northern face of the Mikir highlands; number, 47,650. The R\u00e1bhas (56,499) and H\u00e1jungs (4354), who are found at the foot of the G\u00e1ro Hills, and the Mechs (57,890) in Go\u00e1lp\u00e1ra District, are also closely connected with the K\u00e1ch\u00e1ri or Bodo tribe. The two tribes of Ahams and Chutiy\u00e1s are the descendants of former masters of Assam, who have now sunk to the condition of ordinary Hindu cultivators. The Aham dynasty survived to the beginning of the present century; but according to the Census of 1881, there are now only 179,314 of this race to be found in the Province\u2014principally in the District of Sibs\u00e1gar, which contains the ruins of several of their capitals, and in Lakhimpur.

Since then, some errors have been discovered, the exact area for the following Districts has been ascertained to be\u2014Sylhet, 539\u00bd square miles; Goalpara, 3953 square miles; and G\u00e1ro Hills, 3749 square miles. The areas for the other hill tracts is only an estimate, but believed to be generally close to accuracy.\n\n\u2020 Including an estimate of 92,000 as the population of the hill tracts in which no census was taken.\n\n\u2021 For the civil and military station of Kohima only.\nDistrict. The Kochs (230,382) and the R\u00e1jbans\u00eds (106,376) form the great aboriginal castes of North-eastern Bengal in the Brahmaputra valley.\n\nThe other principal aboriginal tribes are the following:\u2014Mik\u00edrs, originally inhabiting the lower hills and adjacent lowlands of the central portion of the range stretching from the G\u00e1ro to the P\u00e1tkoi Hills, but forced by pressure from hostile tribes to migrate to their present seat in the Mik\u00edr Hills. This consists of a low mountain tract in Nowgong, cut off by the valleys of the Kopili and Dhaneswari from the main range of the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills; number in 1881, 77,765. The Kh\u00e1mt\u00edis are a tribe of Shan descent, principally found in the country around Sadiy\u00e1; number within British territory in 1881, 2883. M\u00edr\u00ed (25,636), Daphl\u00e1 (549), and Abar (821), are the names given by the Assamese to three sections of one and the same race inhabiting the mountains between the Assam valley and Tibet, and settled also to some extent (especially the M\u00edr\u00ed\u00eds) in the valley itself, where they follow a system of migratory cultivation. Manip\u00faris number 40,443; Syntengs or Santengs, 47,815; Madah\u00eds, 13,159; and Kuk\u00eds, 10,812. A description of the principal aboriginal tribes will be found under their respective alphabetical headings. The total undoubtedly aboriginal population is returned, according to race, at 1,596,817, although the number still professing primitive faiths is only 488,251.\n\nReligion\u2014Hindus.\u2014In the religious classification, the Hindus are returned at 3,062,148, or 62\u00b78 per cent. of the total population. This number, however, includes the majority of the aboriginal tribes given above. The total number of recognised Hindu castes is returned at 1,911,906. The Br\u00e1hmans (119,075 in number) are among the oldest of the Hindu settlers in the Brahmaputra valley. They penetrated to its farthest north-eastern corner under the Hindu dynasties which preceded the Aham invasion, and they are repeatedly mentioned in the accounts of the rising Aham kingdom. Successive immigrations of Br\u00e1hmans are recorded as having taken place in Lower Assam. The R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Kam\u00e1t\u00e1pur (see Rangpur District), whose dominions extended into K\u00e1mr\u00e1p, imported a number of Br\u00e1hmans from Behar in the 13th or 14th century. Early in the 16th century, the great Koch ruler, Viswa Singh, introduced a settlement of Br\u00e1hmans, whose descendants are known as K\u00e1mr\u00e1p\u00ed Br\u00e1hmans to this day. The Br\u00e1hmans of Upper Assam appear to have been Vishnu-worshippers from the earliest historical times, and the deity worshipped by the Aham kings on their first introduction into Hinduism in the 17th century is described as Govind Th\u00e1kur. The majority of the Br\u00e1hmans of Upper Assam claim a doubtful connection with Kanauj. The principal T\u00e1ntrik families, who are Siva-worshippers, are found in the lower Districts and trace their origin to a colony of Nadiy\u00e1 Br\u00e1hmans imported by the\nAham king, Rudra Singh, about the close of the 17th century. One of these became r\u00e1j-guru or Court Confessor, while others had temples or lands assigned to them in K\u00e1mr\u00fap. The T\u00e1ntrik Br\u00e1hmans eat the flesh of animals offered in sacrifice to Dev\u00ed, and drink spirits; but these practices are an abomination to the mass of the Assamese cultivators, who are zealous Vaishnavas, under a strong religious organization of sect-leaders and spiritual guides. Ganaks (23,914 in number) are a lower class of Br\u00e1hmans, said to be of inferior origin on the mother's side, and to have become otherwise degraded by their acceptance of alms from the lower castes. In Assam, however, they enjoy greater honour than in Bengal, and the head of one of their religious houses maintains their claim to be regarded as equal to the other Br\u00e1hmans. Their profession is astrology and the casting of horoscopes.\n\nThe Bhuiy\u00e1s or B\u00e1ra Bhuiy\u00e1s of Assam (5218 in number) are supposed to be of the same stock as the Bhuinh\u00e1r or landowning Br\u00e1hman and R\u00e1jput caste of Behar and the eastern Districts of the North-Western Provinces. According to the native histories of Assam, the Bhuiy\u00e1s were the heads of twelve families given as hostages by a western chieftain to a king of the line which succeeded the P\u00e1l dynasty on the throne of Kam\u00e1t\u00e1pur. Six of these families were Br\u00e1hmans and six K\u00e1yasths, their leader being a K\u00e1yasth named Chandibar, who is claimed as the great-great-grandfather of the religious reformer Sankara Ach\u00e1rya. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Kam\u00e1t\u00e1pur settled these Bhuiy\u00e1s on the eastern border of his kingdom, corresponding to parts of the present Districts of Nowgong and Darrang. Here they were known as the B\u00e1ra (or twelve) Bhuiy\u00e1s, and formed a kind of ruling aristocracy among the surrounding Koch population. In the early part of the 16th century, they were either overthrown by, or made submission to, the Aham king, who appointed many of their young men to honourable offices about his Court. The Bhuiy\u00e1s of the present day claim to rank as superior to the Kalit\u00e1s\u2014a claim, however, which the latter refuse to admit.\n\nThe Kalit\u00e1s are a caste almost peculiar to Assam. They rank as the highest of the S\u00fadra castes native to the Brahmaputra valley, and claim an equality with the K\u00e1yasth caste of Bengal. One tradition derives them from Kshattriya refugees, who, flying eastwards across the T\u00edst\u00e1 from the wrath of Par\u00e1su-r\u00e1ma, dissembled their caste, and became known as Kul-lupta, or of obliterated caste. Another story is that the Kalit\u00e1s are K\u00e1yasths who have lost caste by putting their hands to the plough. They are said to have entered Assam from Rangpur when the Koch dynasty was flourishing, although it is not improbable that their advent was of much earlier date. It has been supposed that the Kalit\u00e1s were the religious instructors of the Koch rulers of Rangpur, and subsequently of the Ahams, and that they were gradually displaced from this position by Br\u00e1hmans. This theory of the Kalit\u00e1s' position is not,\nhowever, borne out by native histories, as Br\u00e1hmans were among the oldest Hindu inhabitants of the Assam valley; and it is certain that the conversion of the Aham kings to Hinduism was effected not by Kalit\u00e1s, but by Br\u00e1hmans, while in later years the r\u00e1j-guru or Court Confessor seems invariably to have been a Br\u00e1hman. Nor can the Kalit\u00e1 Gos\u00e1ins of the present day be regarded as survivals of an ancient Kalit\u00e1 hierarchy antecedent to Br\u00e1hmanism, seeing that they owe their origin to a religious movement instituted by Sankara in the 15th century, which may be described as a revolt against the spiritual ascendancy of the Br\u00e1hmans. Although chiefly employed in agriculture, Kalit\u00e1s are frequently met with also as traders and clerks. Those who occupy positions of respectability claim to be regarded as K\u00e1yasths, and call themselves by that name, asserting that they have regained their caste by abandoning agriculture. The last step in their social progress is investiture with the sacred thread worn by K\u00e1yasths; after which the Kalit\u00e1 considers himself entitled to intermarry with the K\u00e1yasths of Assam, but it is very doubtful whether this claim would be admitted by the Bengal K\u00e1yasths. The Kalit\u00e1 has always been regarded as a genuine Hindu of unmixed Aryan descent; and in the days when slaves were exported from Assam to Bengal, a Kalit\u00e1 lad fetched double the price of a Koch. Members of some artisan castes attach the name Kalit\u00e1 to their caste designation by way of asserting their Aryan origin; but these artisan Kalit\u00e1s are looked upon as inferior to, and may not intermarry nor eat with, the agricultural Kalit\u00e1s. Of the 253,860 Kalit\u00e1s returned in Assam in 1881, 241,589 were inhabitants of the Brahmaputra valley; while of the 185,561 K\u00e1yasths, all but 20,000 were found in the Surm\u00e1 valley.\n\nKaibartt\u00e1s (37,161) and Keuts or Kewats (104,275) are different names for practically one and the same caste (the former occupying the Surm\u00e1 valley, and the latter the Brahmaputra Districts), and are fishermen by hereditary occupation. The Keuts of Assam are counted as one of the respectable S\u00fadra castes, and form a large proportion of the agricultural population. In Lower Assam, a distinction is made between the h\u00e1lwa (agricultural) and j\u00e1lwa (fishing) Keuts, the former being held superior to the latter. Originally of the same caste with the Keuts are the D\u00e1s, who are not found in the Brahmaputra valley at all, but who number 102,065 in Sylhet District, where they have all adopted the more honourable occupation of agriculture, and have abandoned their ancestral trade as fishermen. The Assamese Dom (127,641 in number in 1881, more than two-thirds being found in the Brahmaputra Districts) is usually a fisherman. Though of an inferior caste, he is not regarded, as in Bengal and Upper India, with contempt and aversion, nor does he perform any menial and disagreeable offices. On the contrary, the Dom of Assam pretends to an exceptional degree of ceremonial purity. A Dom coolie, for instance, will refuse to carry fowls, or any receptacle containing\nthem; while the large section of Doms who are Mah\u00e1pur\u00fash\u00edy\u00e1s, or disciples of some religious institution which traces its origin to the reformer Sankara, carry their punctiliousness so far as to refuse to eat except in clothes specially reserved for that purpose, or still wet from the bath. The very name of Dom is usually euphemized into Nadiy\u00e1l.\n\nK\u00e1tanis (59,847 in number) and Jug\u00eds (112,753). The Census Report states that it seems doubtful how far Jug\u00eds should be classed among Hindus, and that it is not unlikely they are the remnants of some degraded non-Aryan race. The genuine Jug\u00ed is said to eat all manner of meat, to have no priests or spiritual guide (gosd\u00edn), and to bury the dead. A large number have enrolled themselves among Hindu castes by the name of K\u00e1tani, which means spinners and reelers of thread. The breeding of the mulberry silk-worm was assigned to this caste by the Aham kings, and the occupation remains peculiar to them to this day, though, with the decline of the silk industry, a number of them have taken to agriculture, and look down upon their fellows who still cling to their ancient occupation.\n\nChand\u00e1ls number 173,532; namely, 141,310 in Sylhet and Cachar, and 32,222 in the Brahmaputra Districts. The Chand\u00e1ls of the Assam valley were returned in the Census Report together with the H\u00edras. H\u00edra is a caste of potters peculiar to the Assam valley, and distinguished from Kumbh\u00e1rs by the fact that their workers are women, who shape the vessels by hand without the assistance of the potter's wheel. The moist clay is added strip by strip, being beaten out between two flat pieces of stone. Upon the men devolves the labour of fetching reeds for fuel from the jungle, and of baking the moulded pots. They do not, like the Kumbh\u00e1rs, use a furnace for the purpose, but simply pile the vessels on an open space with the reeds in layers between. Hiras and Chand\u00e1ls are regarded as on the same level generally throughout the Assam valley, but they will not eat together nor intermarry.\n\nThe Bori\u00e1s (20,438 in number) are an agricultural caste, peculiar to the Assam valley, deriving their name from the Assamese word bauri, a widow. A Bori\u00e1 is the offspring of a Br\u00e1hman widow by a man of any other caste. They call themselves by the euphemistic title of H\u00fad or S\u00fat (i.e. S\u00fadra); or possibly the word may indicate some claim to relationship with the renowned expounder of the Pur\u00e1na\u015b of the same name, who was born of a Br\u00e1hman widow. The S\u00e1lais or Sh\u00e1lois (12,093 in number) are also an agricultural caste peculiar to the Assam valley, ranking beneath the Keuts, although the members themselves assert their right to the rank of K\u00e1yasths. The H\u00e1ris (11,534 in number, confined to the Brahmaputra valley) were scavengers and sweepers under the Aham kings, although it would now be impossible to induce a H\u00e1ri to perform any such menial office. Where they are not agriculturists, the H\u00e1ris have taken to the trade of goldsmiths, and\ncall themselves by the more respectable title of *brithiy\u00e1t* or artisan. The lowest members of the caste still keep pigs and eat fowls, but the majority have entirely conformed to Hindu notions as regards food and drink, and rank next below the Dom in social estimation. The two sections of the caste do not eat together or intermarry.\n\nThe N\u00e1pit or barber caste (31,249 in number) style themselves Kalit\u00e1 in the Assam valley, where they number 7398, and assert their claim to rank with the highest S\u00fadra castes. The Nat (11,204) is a dancer or singer by profession, although all professional dancers and singers are not Nats. A Koch, or even a Kalit\u00e1, may take to this way of earning his living without losing caste, and some of the singing and dancing Nats add Kalit\u00e1 to their name, in order to mark themselves as genuine S\u00fadras.\n\nThe Bhumij (25,459 in number, mainly in the Brahmaputra valley) are wrongly classed as Hindus in the Census tables. They are aborigines from the highlands of Southern Bengal, imported in large numbers into Assam as tea-garden coolies, and are most numerous in the great tea-growing District of Sibs\u00e1g\u00e1r.\n\nThe Muhammadan population of Assam in 1881 numbered 1,317,022, or 26.9 per cent. of the total population. The great bulk of the Musalm\u00e1ns is found in the Surm\u00e1 valley, where they number 1,107,924, being almost equally numerous with the Hindus. In Sylhet District, the Muhammadans outnumber the Hindus. In the Brahmaputra valley, the Muhammadans number only 208,431, or less than one-tenth of the total population; while in the hill tracts, with a total population of 373,807, the faith of Isl\u00e1m has only 667 adherents. The common appellation of Muhammadans in the Assam valley is Gori\u00e1, a name which probably connotes the introduction of the faith by invaders from Gaur in Bengal. Sylhet was occupied by the Muhammadans as early as the 14th century; but it was not till 1663 that the kingdom of Kuch Behar, including Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1, K\u00e1mrup, and the western border of Darrang, was overrun by the Musalm\u00e1ns. About 1662, Aurangzeb\u2019s general, M\u00edr Juml\u00e1, with a large army advanced up the Assam valley as far as Garhg\u00e1on, the capital of the Aham king, and imposed a tribute upon him. Though the Assamese were unable to face the superior arms of the invaders, yet the insidious climate, and the difficulty of communications, soon compelled the Musalm\u00e1ns to abandon their conquests in Upper Assam. A second invading force was defeated about 1669, and the Muhammadans were driven behind the Man\u00e1s river. Ten years later, taking advantage of internal dissensions in the Aham kingdom, the Muhammadans regained possession of Gauh\u00e1t\u00ed, but were finally expelled about 1688. Thenceforward, the outposts of Isl\u00e1m were, on the south bank of the Brahmaputra, at Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1; and on the north bank, at R\u00e1ng\u00e1mati, about 36 miles farther to the west.\n\nThe Musalm\u00e1n peasants of Assam, like those of Lower Bengal, are\nextremely ignorant of the elements of their own faith. Some of them have never heard of Muhammad; some regard him as a person corresponding in their system of religion to the R\u00e1m\u00e1 or Lakshman of the Hindus; others, again, believe that the word is an appellation expressive of the unity of God; while some of the better educated explain that Muhammad is their dang\u00e1r pir or chief saint. The Kur\u00e1n is hardly read, even in Bengali, and in the original Arabic not at all; many of those who have heard of it cannot tell who wrote it. Yet any Muhammadan peasant is able to repeat a few scraps of prayer in Arabic with a pronunciation of surprising accuracy, though his explanations of their supposed meaning are often ingeniously wide of the mark. The Musalm\u00e1ns of Assam have borrowed much of the spiritual machinery of the Hindus. They have their gos\u00e1ins or spiritual preceptors, to one of whom every Musalm\u00e1n is bound to attach himself. These gos\u00e1ins have their own establishments of resident disciples, who, however, are not bound by vows of celibacy. They collect tribute or subscriptions from non-resident disciples, by means of their own village officers.\n\nAn interesting sub-division of lapsed Muhammadans in the Assam valley are the people called Mari\u00e1s. They are not returned as a separate class in the Census Report, owing probably to the progress they have made towards orthodox Muhammadanism. Although few in number, these Mari\u00e1s have a history of their own. There seems little reason to doubt that they are the relics of one of the earlier Musalm\u00e1n invasions; and the native histories relate how in 1510 a Muhammadan force was sent into Assam by the ruler of Gaur, which fought its way up the south bank of the Brahmaputra as far as Kali\u00e1bar, where, however, it was surrounded and broken by reinforcements of Assamese from Upper Assam. Those of the invading force who escaped slaughter were carried away into captivity; and, being in turns unsuccessfully employed first as cultivators, then as wood-cutters, and again as grass-cutters to the royal elephants, they ultimately elected to be braziers, and braziers they are still, though they frequently eke out the profits of their trade with a little agriculture. During the period of their isolation in Assam, the Mari\u00e1s departed considerably from the doctrines of their religion. Circumcision fell into disuse, and they borrowed from the Assamese the custom of drinking strong liquor and eating swine\u2019s flesh. But the gradual development of the country has been favourable to the introduction of a purer form of Muhammadanism, and late years have witnessed a great reform. Most of the larger communities of Mari\u00e1s are now found to profess all the orthodox doctrines of Isl\u00e1m; they practise circumcision, abstain religiously from forbidden meat and drink, follow recognised Musalm\u00e1n gos\u00e1ins, and proudly assert that the mull\u00e1s of the b\u00e1z\u00e1r will partake of food with them.\n\nChristians.\u2014The total number of Christians in Assam in 1881 was\n7093, of whom 1631 were Europeans and Eurasians, and 5642 were natives. A large increase in native Christians since 1872 is mainly due to the immigration of Christian Sant\u00e1ls and Kols to the tea Districts, and to the establishment of a new Sant\u00e1l colony at Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1. The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel and the American Baptist Mission have stations in Darrang, Nowgong, and Sibs\u00e1g\u00e1r Districts. In Cachar and Sylhet there were no missionaries in 1881, but a branch of the Welsh Mission formerly flourished in Sylhet town, and had an excellent school there, at which the sons of many gentlemen of the neighbourhood obtained their education; some high-placed Government officials are now the leaders of this little community. Cachar has been visited from time to time by the American Mission. There are a number of Kol and Sant\u00e1l native Christians in Cachar, and some in Sylhet; a small community of this class in South Cachar have built themselves a church. But missionary effort has been principally active in the Kh\u00e1s\u00ed Hills, where the Welsh Calvinistic Methodists have seven missions; and in the G\u00e1ro Hills, where there is a body of American Baptists, who work chiefly among the G\u00e1ros in that District and in Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1. The Kh\u00e1s\u00ed followers of the Welsh Mission were returned in 1881 at 1796, but the books of the Mission itself show 2060 professing Christians and 1226 probationers. The Americans have, according to the Census, 730 converts in the G\u00e1ro Hills and Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1; but their own returns in the same year show 821 communicants, and 396 children of Christian parents. Classified by sect, the Christian population numbers, according to the Census,\u2014Church of England, 1676; Roman Catholics, 351; Presbyterians, 290; Baptists, 1475; Wesleyans, 10; Welsh Calvinistic Methodists, 1827; Lutherans, 220; Unitarians, 3; Armenians, 5; and \u2018others\u2019 and unspecified, 1035.\n\nThe Buddhists number 6563, found only in five Districts of the Brahmaputra valley. This religion is professed by Bhuti\u00e1s, who inhabit the north edge of the valley, or who come down in the cold season to trade; by scattered remnants of the Burmese invasion called Muns, who live in a few villages in Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 and K\u00e1mrup; and by Kh\u00e1mtis, Phaki\u00e1ls, and Aitoniy\u00e1s, who inhabit the eastern portion of Lakhimpur, and have some settlements in North Lakhimpur, Sibs\u00e1g\u00e1r, and the N\u00e1mbar forest at the foot of the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills. The number of Buddhists returned, however, very inadequately represents the Buddhist subjects of the Queen in Assam; for the majority of the Kh\u00e1mtis and Phaki\u00e1ls live beyond the Teng\u00e1p\u00e1n\u00ed river, which was the limit of the Census, although not the limit of British dominion.\n\nJains.\u2014The Census returns the number of Jains at only 158, of whom 145 are males and 13 females. These are active and enterprising M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri merchants from R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, who carry on most of the import and export trade of the Brahmaputra valley. No Jains are returned in\nthe Surm\u00e1 valley (where the bulk of the trade is in the hands of Muham-\nmadans), though it is known that a few exist, who were probably entered\nas Hindus. In the Brahmaputra valley also, their numbers are much\nunderstated; and indeed, the line of separation between the modern Jain\nand the Hindu is a very thin one. Few of the Jains are permanent\nresidents of the Province, and they seldom bring their families with them.\n\nBr\u00e1hmos.\u2014This sect of theistic Hindus is returned as numbering\n177, namely, 124 males and 53 females. They are found in all the\nplains Districts except Lakhimpur, and also in the Kh\u00e1s\u00ed and G\u00e1ro Hills,\nand are in all cases Bengali clerks in Government offices.\n\nDistribution of the Population into Town and Country.\u2014The Province\nof Assam is essentially a rural and agricultural country, with little trade,\nfew manufactures, and hardly any towns. Indeed, only seven towns\nwere returned in 1881 as containing upwards of 5000 inhabitants\u2014\nnamely, Sylhet, population 14,407; Barpeta, 13,758; Gauhati,\n11,695; Dibrugarh, 7153; Goalpara, 6697; Silchar, 6567; and\nSibsagar, 5868. Shillong, the administrative head-quarters of the\nProvince, in the Kh\u00e1s\u00ed Hills, had, in 1881, a population of only 3737.\nThese towns, again, are mostly conglomerations of villages. Silchar and\nSylhet are the only places in which there is the least approach to a close\npacking of the inhabitants; Dibrugarh and Sibs\u00e1gar towns are not much\nmore thickly peopled than many great agricultural areas, such as the\nDistricts of S\u00e1ran in Bengal and Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur in the North-Western Pro-\nvinces. Of the 21,419 towns and villages (excepting 758 villages in\nthe G\u00e1ro Hills, for which no details are available), no less than 14,469\ncontained less than two hundred inhabitants; 5285 had from two to\nfive hundred; 1290 from five hundred to a thousand; 326 from one to\ntwo thousand; 35 from two to three thousand; 7 from three to five\nthousand; and 7 upwards of five thousand inhabitants.\n\nOccupations of the People.\u2014The occupations of persons in Assam are\ndivided into the following six great classes:\u2014Professional, domestic,\ncommercial, agricultural, industrial and indefinite. Under the last\nor sixth class are grouped not only persons who return themselves by\nsuch vague descriptions as \u2018labourers,\u2019 \u2018gentlemen,\u2019 \u2018beggars,\u2019 or\n\u2018vagrants,\u2019 but also persons against whom no return at all is entered,\nand who cannot be said to have any occupation, such as children and\nnon-working women. Hence some uncertainty. The occupations of the\nmales (omitting the G\u00e1ro and N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills) are\u2014Class I. Professional,\n28,641; namely, (a) officers of national government, 3643; (b) officers\nof municipal and local government, 5562; (c) engaged in learned pro-\nfessions, namely, clergymen, priests and temple officers, lawyers, authors,\nartists, musicians, actors, teachers, and scientific persons, 17,414. Class\nII. Domestic; including house-servants, innkeepers, etc., 14,356.\nClass III. Commercial, 50,504; namely, (a) merchants, 3726; (b)\ngeneral dealers, 38,562; and (c) carters, carriers, boatmen, etc., 8284.\n\nClass IV. Agricultural, 1,333,437; including (among others) (a) 51,747 landed proprietors; (b) 657 tea planters; (c) 1062 tea-garden employes; (d) 107,564 tea coolies; (e) 1,100,176 tenant cultivators; (f) 26,217 agricultural labourers, etc. Class V. Industrial, 44,998; including (a) 447 engaged in mechanic productions, chiefly carpenters (3744); (b) 17,280 workers and dealers in textile fabrics; (c) 9306 workers and dealers in food and drinks; (d) 761 dealers and workers in animal substances; (e) 2532 workers and dealers in vegetable substances; (f) 10,753 workers and dealers in minerals; and (g) 51,939 fishermen and persons engaged about animals. Class VI. Indefinite, 931,012; including (a) 40,948 general labourers; (b) 15,539, mainly beggars and religious devotees; (c) 161 gentlemen of rank and property without special occupation; and (d) 874,844 male children or otherwise unspecified. The details do not quite agree with the totals in this statement, as the latter is exclusive of the N\u00e1g\u00e1 and G\u00e1ro Hills, while the former include the occupations of the residents of Koh\u00edm\u00e1, and of the plains portion of the G\u00e1ro Hills.\n\nThe Material Condition of the People is prosperous, and the Commissioner of the Assam Valley reports that 'there is no doubt that the mass of the people are happy and contented.' This may be said with even greater emphasis of the Surm\u00e1 Valley Districts, where food is abundant, taxation extremely light, and the demand for labour great. The Deputy Commissioner of Lakhimpur makes the following remarks on this subject:\u2014'The middle class of people who live on a fixed pay, a pay which was estimated as barely sufficient in other and cheaper Districts, are very hard pressed. It is believed that the clerks (aml\u00e1) of the Government offices here are nearly all in debt. On the other hand, the cultivators can get such high prices for their crops, bamboos, etc., that they are extremely well off; and the demand for manual labour for railway works is so great, that the commonest coolie gets from Rs. 12 (\u00a31, 4s.) to Rs. 16 (\u00a31, 12s.) a month. Skilled labourers, such as carpenters and blacksmiths, earn from one rupee (2s.) a day up to a much higher rate for a really good man. Domestic servants are hardly procurable, even with very high pay. In fact, with the exception of salaried officials, who do not share in the increasing prosperity of the country, but, on the contrary, suffer in proportion as trade increases, this District (Lakhimpur) may be considered in a very flourishing condition.'\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The one staple crop of Assam is rice. In the valley of the Brahmaputra, three crops of rice are grown in the year: (1) The s\u00e1l\u00ed, or winter crop, corresponding in some respects to the \u00e1man of Bengal. Both names are used in Sylhet; that called \u00e1man is sown broadcast in the deep water of the great hollows or haors lying between\nthe river channels; the s\u00e1li, or sail, as it is locally known in Sylhet, is transplanted from a seed bed, and does not require more than two or three feet of water. (2) The \u00e1hu or \u00e1us, sown on comparatively high lands. (3) The b\u00e1o, or boro, a variety of rice sown broadcast, and corresponding closely to \u00e1man. A good deal of boro rice is sown in Sylhet, in the bottom of the haors on the subsidence of the annual floods, and along the banks of the rivers. Of these, the s\u00e1li furnishes by far the larger portion of the food supply. In the Surm\u00e1 valley, the same three crops of rice are grown, and called by their Bengali names.\n\nThe other crops include mustard-seed in abundance, chiefly sown on dry sandy soil liable to inundation; pulses to a smaller extent; sugar-cane, Indian corn, betel-nut, betel-leaf, and tobacco. The cultivation of jute is confined to Sylhet and Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 Districts, and that of cotton to the hill tracts. The aboriginal races in the hills usually follow the nomadic mode of agriculture known as j\u00fam, which is extremely destructive to the forests. They roughly clear a piece of primeval jungle by burning down the vegetation; among the ashes they dibble holes with their d\u00e1os or hill-knives, and drop into them indiscriminately seeds of rice, mustard, and cotton, reaping each crop in succession as it comes to maturity. After the natural fertility of the soil has been exhausted by the crops of two or three years, the spot is abandoned for a fresh clearing. This method of cultivation is now no longer followed by the K\u00e1ch\u00e1ris, the most numerous aboriginal tribe in the lower Districts of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1, K\u00e1mrup, and Darrang; nor is it universally followed throughout the whole of the Kh\u00e1s\u00ed Hills, or in the central portion of the N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills. With the exception of North Cachar, each of the hill Districts contains a certain portion of settled cultivation, in irrigated and terraced rice-fields filling the valley bottoms. Potatoes, oranges, pine-apples, and tezp\u00e1t or bay leaves are grown at the foot of the Kh\u00e1s\u00ed and Jainti\u00e1 Hills and in Sylhet, for the Calcutta market.\n\nThe soil of Assam is extremely fertile. Neither manure nor irrigation is required, as the rivers rarely fail to overflow their banks and deposit a fresh top-dressing of silt every year. There is abundance of waste land on all sides waiting for tillage. The pressure of the population is at present very light. The revenue demand is comparatively low, and is levied in a manner most convenient to the cultivators. No landlords intervene between the Government and the actual tillers of the soil; and, as a rule, this latter class is not deeply in debt. Labour is in great demand on the tea plantations, at high rates of wages. With all these natural advantages, the cultivators of Assam cannot be otherwise than prosperous. They raise nearly every article of domestic consumption from their own fields, and live in ease and independence. But they are not an industrious race.\nThey produce no great staples for export, and do not even care to grow more rice than is sufficient for their own families. With the single exception of Sylhet, which geographically belongs to Bengal, every other District of Assam annually requires to import rice and other grain, although not to any considerable extent, in order to feed the labouring population employed on the tea-gardens. The quantity of rice thus imported into Assam in 1881 was 150,000 tons. According to the returns for 1880\u201381, out of a total area of 30,151 square miles in the Brahmaputra and Surma valleys, only 6843, or 22.6 per cent., are cultivated; while 16,813, or 52.7 per cent., are waste but cultivable.\n\nAs in the rest of India, the State is the superior landlord of the soil. In Sylhet and in the greater part of Goalpara, which originally was included within Bengal, the Permanent Settlement is in force. The land settlement in Sylhet is distinguished from all other Permanent Settlements in India, except that of Chittagong, by the fact that it was mainly r\u00e2yav\u00e2r\u00ee, or made direct with the cultivators, instead of with zamind\u00e2rs. The settlement extended, however, only to parts which up to that time were cultivated. There was then a large extent of waste and forest land especially along the southern border, into which cultivation has since extended; and this is now temporarily settled. A tract of about 450 square miles in the northeast corner of Sylhet is also under a temporary settlement. The peculiarity of the Cachar tenure is that the estates are settled with companies of husbandmen, united by no tie of blood, caste, or religion, but who combine together for the purpose of taking up new lands, and bringing them under the plough. These cultivators are known as mir\u00e2sad\u00e2rs; the settlement is made for a term of years; and the mutual relations of these partners to each other, and the shares which they respectively hold in the estates, are frequently of a most complicated character. Throughout the Brahmaputra valley, the land system is effected on the system known as mauz\u00e2d\u00e2r\u00ee, according to which the mauz\u00e2d\u00e2r becomes virtually a contractor for the Government revenue for his mauz\u00e2, or collection of villages, often comprising a large tract. The revenue is levied primarily from the mauz\u00e2d\u00e2r, and he recoups himself from the individual cultivator. This system is thus a survival of the method of collection through chaudhar\u00ees, which was once very general in Bengal, and was the form of collection which the Permanent Settlement converted into a landlord system, turning the chaudhar\u00ees into zamind\u00e2rs. The mauz\u00e2d\u00e2r measures annually the new and relinquished cultivation of each holding, and adjusts the revenue demand according to the area actually under tillage. The patt\u00e2s, or leases, held by the cultivators are granted by the District officers, and are chiefly though not exclusively annual. The mauz\u00e2d\u00e2r system prevails throughout Assam proper, and in the Eastern Dwars. In\nthe hill Districts, and in several portions of the plains of Lakhimpur, the land revenue is taken in the form of a house, hoe, or poll-tax.\n\nThe rates of rent in force in the five Districts of Assam proper are as follow:\u2014For *basti*, or homestead and garden land, 6s. an acre; for *r\u00fapit*, or low-lying land on which the *s\u00e1li* rice is grown, 3s. 9d. an acre; for *pharinghati*, or high land on which the *\u00e1us* rice and most other crops are grown, 3s. an acre. In the Eastern Dw\u00e1rs, however, the prevailing rates for *basti* and *r\u00fapit* lands are 3s. an acre; and for *pharingati* land, 1s. 6d. an acre. Of a total population of 2,158,027 of specified occupations in the Surm\u00e1 and Brahmaputra valleys (*i.e.* excluding children and persons of unspecified occupations, as also the entire population of the hill tracts), 1,938,464, or 89.81 per cent., were returned as agriculturists. Of the total area of 27,666 square miles, occupied by the above population, only 6715 square miles are cultivated and assessed for Government revenue.\n\nThe rate of assessment varies greatly in different tracts. In Sylhet, the land revenue (exclusive of local rates) averages 5\u00bdd. per acre on the permanently settled estates, and about 2s. 4\u00bdd. on those temporarily settled: in Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 about \u00bed. per acre on the permanent, and 2s. 5\u00bdd. on the temporarily-settled lands. The permanently-settled estates of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 pay probably less land revenue than any other part of India; indeed, in one case, the proprietor actually receives payment from Government instead of making it, the compensation granted him when his market and transit dues were abolished exceeding the total land revenue payable. The average incidence of land revenue in the temporarily settled tracts in the Surm\u00e1 and Brahmaputra valleys is 3s. 1\u00bdd. per acre, and of local rates 2\u00bed.; total, 3s. 4\u00bdd. per acre. The revenue, however, is not in all cases borne by the cultivated land; a certain portion is paid by the waste land grants, which are extensive in Cachar, Lakhimpur, and Sibs\u00e1g\u00e1r.\n\n*Natural Calamities* on a scale sufficiently large to affect the general harvest are almost unknown in Assam. The only famines recorded in local tradition are those caused by the depredations of the Burmese in the early years of the present century, when anarchy prevailed to such an extent that whole Districts were depopulated. Blights, locusts, droughts, and floods occasionally occur; and of these, floods do the most mischief. But no preventive measures in the form of irrigation works or embankments are required. In the event of a widespread local failure of the crops, the means of importation from Bengal are sufficient to prevent scarcity from reaching the famine point.\n\n*Tea Cultivation.*\u2014The cultivation and manufacture of tea, conducted with European capital and under European supervision, forms the one great commercial industry of Assam. The tea-gardens occupy a comparatively small area, but they are the principal source of wealth to the\nProvince, and supply the chief stimulants to its development. The first discovery of the tea-plant growing wild in Upper Assam, in 1823, is generally assigned to Mr. Robert Bruce, who had proceeded thither on a mercantile exploration. The country then formed part of the Burmese dominions. But the first Burmese war shortly afterwards broke out, and a brother of the first discoverer having been appointed in 1826 to the command of a flotilla of gunboats, followed up the subject, and obtained several hundred plants and a quantity of seed. Some specimens were ultimately forwarded to the superintendent of the Botanic Garden at Calcutta. In 1832, Captain Jenkins was deputed by the Governor-General of India, Lord William Bentinck, to report upon the resources of Assam, and the tea-plant was specially brought to his notice by Mr. Bruce. In 1834, Lord William Bentinck recorded a minute, stating that his attention had been called to the subject previous to his having left England to take up the Governor-Generalship, and he appointed a committee to prosecute inquiries, and to promote the cultivation of the plant. Communications were opened with China with a view to obtain fresh plants and seeds, and a deputation, composed of gentlemen versed in botanical studies, was despatched to Assam. Seed was obtained from China; but it was ascertained that the tea-plant was indigenous in Assam, and might be multiplied to any extent. Another result of the Chinese mission, the procuring of persons skilled in the cultivation and manufacture of black tea, was of more material benefit. Subsequently, under Lord Auckland, a further supply of Chinese cultivators and manufacturers was obtained\u2014men well acquainted with the processes necessary for the production of green tea, as the former set were with those requisite for black.\n\nA great deal of plant is still grown from pure China seed, especially in Cachar and the older gardens. But China seed is now disliked and avoided. The hybrid produced from it and the Assam plant is the most flavoured, and is generally preferred by the planters as combining the best qualities of both. Government undertook the experimental introduction of tea-planting into Assam. In 1835, the first tea-garden was opened at Lakhimpur. In 1838, the first twelve chests of tea from Assam were received in England. They had been injured in some degree on the passage; but on samples being submitted to brokers, the reports were highly favourable. It was never, however, the intention of Government to carry on the trade, but to resign it to private enterprise as soon as the experimental cultivation proved successful. Mercantile associations for the planting and manufacture of tea in Assam began to be formed in 1839; and in 1840, Government made over its experimental establishment to the Assam Tea Company. In 1851, the crop of this Company was estimated at 280,000 lbs. In 1854, gardens were opened in Darrang and K\u00e1mr\u00fap; and in 1855, the\nplant was discovered growing wild in Cachar. During the next ten years, capital flowed into the business from all quarters. Land was recklessly taken up, to be sold to speculators in England for extravagant sums; and tea-growing for a time fell into the hands of stockjobbers and bubble companies. The crash came in 1866; and for the next few years this promising industry lay in a condition of extreme depression.\n\nAbout 1869, matters began to mend; and tea cultivation, now established on a sound basis, is making legitimate progress year by year. The returns for 1871 showed 11,475,398 lbs. of tea manufactured in Assam, against 9,511,517 in 1870. In 1878, the total area in Assam taken up for tea was 587,409 acres, of which 109,577 acres were under mature, and 40,975 acres under immature plants; out-turn, 28,509,548 lbs. In 1879, 112,685 acres of mature plant yielded 31,386,636 lbs. of tea; in 1880, an area of 120,512 acres yielded 34,013,583 lbs.; and in 1881, an area of 133,293 acres yielded 37,571,311 lbs., the average out-turn per acre of mature plant being 282 lbs. The total value of the tea exported from Assam into Bengal in 1880\u201381 was returned at \u00a32,828,670; and in 1881\u201382, at \u00a32,835,840. The number of tea plantations in the latter year in the Assam Province was 1058.\n\nImportation of Coolies.\u2014The deficiency of labour in the Assam valley has developed an important system of coolie emigration from Bengal. With the exception of the Kacharis, the natives of Assam are too indolent or too well-to-do to accept regular employment, even at high rates of wages; and a tradition has been handed down from the days of their Aham taskmasters that it is degrading to work for others. The average monthly number of labourers employed on the tea-gardens of Assam during 1871 was 54,326, of whom upwards of 38,000 were imported under the Labour Transport Acts, chiefly from the western Districts of Lower Bengal. On those gardens which furnished returns in 1874 there were 289 Europeans employed, and an average monthly number of 84,394 labourers. By the end of the year 1880 the number of labourers had increased to 187,300, and by the end of 1881 to 195,782. It is estimated that a sum of at least one and a half millions sterling is annually expended in the Province in connection with the tea industry. The total population of the Assam tea-gardens was returned by the Census of 1881 at 258,146, of whom 67,775 were returned as born within the Province; 189,683 from other parts of India; and 688 outside of India. The transport of labourers to Assam, and the protection of those who enter into long contracts, are regulated by law. But it is hoped that, with the opening of railway communication with Assam, the necessity for such legislative interference will gradually disappear. For an account of tea cultivation and manufacture, see Darjiling District.\n\nThe land best suited for the plant is the virgin soil of the dense forests at the foot of the hills, where the climate is hot and moist.\nThis soil is to be found in every District of Assam; but by far the largest number of gardens are in the four Districts of Cachar, Lakhimpur, Sibs\u00e1gar, and Darrang. The land is held either on long leases under Government, or in fee-simple.\n\nManufactures, etc.\u2014The principal native industry in the Assam valley is the weaving of coarse silk cloth, but this is now in a languishing condition. This cloth is of two kinds\u2014eri\u00e1 and m\u00fag\u00e1; the former being the produce of a worm fed on the castor-oil plant (Ricinus communis); the latter of a worm fed on the sim tree (Machilus odoratissima), which grows wild in the jungle. The ordinary mulberry silk-worm is also cultivated by the Jug\u00ed caste, and the cocoons woven into silk cloth. Cotton cloth, brass-ware, pottery, ivory ornaments, and the ordinary utensils are also manufactured; but the indigenous manufactures of Assam have suffered greatly from the competition of the cheaper articles imported from Bengal. In Sylhet and the Surm\u00e1 valley there are specialties of sitalp\u00e1ti or grass mats, shell bracelets, ivory mats and fans, and inlaid iron-ware. The other important industries of Sylhet are lime-burning, boat-building, and sugar-boiling. In the Kh\u00e1s\u00ed and Jainti\u00e1 hills, the manufactures consist principally of various articles of bamboo and cane work, cotton and silk fabrics, articles of iron, gold and silver ornaments, and a few musical instruments.\n\nThe external commerce of Assam is almost entirely conducted by water. Both of the two main rivers, the Brahmaputra and Surm\u00e1, are navigable by steamers. According to the registration returns of river trade in 1880\u201381, the total exports from Assam into Bengal in that year were valued at \u00a33,585,297, of which the following are the most important:\u2014Tea, \u00a32,828,670; mustard seed, \u00a3282,476; linseed, \u00a32660; timber, \u00a372,715; raw cotton, \u00a318,501; lime and limestone (from Sylhet), \u00a3119,611; rice and paddy (also from Sylhet), \u00a316,985; lac, \u00a338,563; caoutchouc, \u00a324,656; jute (raw), \u00a330,084. The imports were valued at \u00a31,686,537, including European piece goods, \u00a3430,760; cotton twist, \u00a335,267; salt, \u00a3197,898; rice, \u00a3124,977; gram and pulse, \u00a360,762; sugar (refined), \u00a341,692; sugar (unrefined), \u00a356,618; iron, \u00a327,196; brass and copper, \u00a343,599; liquors, \u00a358,789; spices, \u00a353,497; betel-nuts, \u00a312,451; tobacco, \u00a359,874. Total exports and imports (1880\u201381), \u00a35,271,834. In 1881\u201382, the exports by water from Assam into Bengal amounted to \u00a33,626,069; imports into Assam from Bengal, \u00a31,887,524; grand total, \u00a35,513,593, or an increase of nearly a quarter of a million over the previous year. The exports of tea and caoutchouc, and the imports of piece-goods, cotton twist, rice, sugar, and liquor, are chiefly carried by steamer; the rest by country boats. Local trade is almost monopolized by M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri or Jain merchants in the Brahmaputra valley. In the Kh\u00e1s\u00ed Hills, the natives keep to themselves the profits made from their...\nvaluable exports. In the Surm\u00e1 valley, the principal traders are Muhammadan merchants from Dacca and Eastern Bengal. Annual or weekly fairs are held during the winter months along all the frontiers of the Province, and have now created a mutually profitable intercourse with the hill tribes. In Lakhimpur, a large fair lasting for a month is held at Sadiy\u00e1, and throughout the cold weather the traders settled in Lakhimpur town are visited by hill-men from the Daphl\u00e1 and Ab\u00e1r country. The trans-frontier trade is carried on with Bh\u00fat\u00e1n, Towang, the Daphl\u00e1, Ab\u00e1r, Mishm\u00ed, and N\u00e1g\u00e1 hills; with Hill Tipperah, the Lush\u00e1i hills, and Manipur. Imports into Assam from the frontier in 1880\u201381, \u00a355,233; exports, \u00a328,404: total, \u00a383,637. In 1881\u201382, the imports into Assam amounted to \u00a370,989, and the exports to \u00a324,313: total, \u00a395,302. Thus, the imports from the frontier increased in value in 1881\u201382 by \u00a315,756 over those for the previous year, while the exports to the frontier decreased by \u00a34091. Net increase of trade in 1881\u201382, \u00a311,665, or 14 per cent., the principal increase being in the trade with Bh\u00fat\u00e1n and Towang. The imports consist chiefly of timber, bamboos, horses and ponies, gold and ivory; and the exports of rice, cotton and silk cloth, brass and copper manufactures, opium and salt.\n\nCommunications.\u2014In the year 1881\u201382, the total length of navigable rivers was returned at 3711 miles; there were also 746 miles of first-class roads, 2148 second-class, and 1523 third-class. The two most important lines of road are: (1) the one recently completed for wheeled traffic from Gauh\u00e1t\u00ed to Shillong,\u2014a triumph of engineering skill; (2) the road running along the south bank of the Brahmaputra, which crosses the river at Dhubr\u00ed, in Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1 District, and there connects with the main system of roads in Northern Bengal. A new cart road from Shillong in Cherra Punji was opened in 1882; an experimental tramway in the tea districts between Jorh\u00e1t and Kukilamukh is nearly completed (1883). A second proposed tramway between Dibrugarh and the landing stage at Dibrumukh, 3\u00be miles in length, was not carried out, owing to the failure of the contractor to complete his contract. Another tramway between Dibrumukh and Dibrugarh is in course of construction. The Assam Railway and Trading Company commenced in 1880\u201381 the construction of a railway from Dibrugarh in Lakhimpur to Dum-duma, with a branch line to the M\u00e1kum coal-fields. This railway was opened for traffic in 1884. But the main channel of communication in Assam is the Brahmaputra River. Two river steam companies, the India General Steam Navigation Company and the River Steam Navigation Company, have for several years past kept up a weekly line of steamers running from Calcutta to Dibrugarh and back. The advertised time-tables give 25 days for the up, and 20 days for the down journey, but these dates are not very accurately kept. Nine days on both the up and down journeys are occupied between Calcutta and\nGo\u00e1land\u00e1. But the latter place being connected with Calcutta by the Eastern Bengal Railway, is virtually the starting point for the up, and the terminus for the down journey, for passengers and for a considerable portion of the cargo. A special daily steamer service for Assam, from the end of the Kaunia branch of the Northern Bengal Railway system at Dhub\u00ed, to Dibrugarh, has been organized under contract with the local government by a large Calcutta firm, and steamers commenced running about the middle of 1883. The upward voyage occupies 4, and the downward 3 days.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The administration of the Province is entrusted to a Chief Commissioner, acting immediately under the orders of the Government of India. Under him, are a Commissioner for the Assam Valley, appointed in 1881; and the Political Agent for Manipur State. Next are eleven Deputy-Commissioners\u2014one for each District\u2014who conduct the various departments of the fiscal, executive, and in some cases judicial administrations. These posts are filled in accordance with what is known as the non-regulation system, being open to military officers and uncovenanted civilians, as well as to members of the covenanted civil service; with the exception of Sylhet, which is reserved for a covenanted officer. There are two judges\u2014one for Assam Proper, and the other for the two Districts of the Surm\u00e1 Valley. The heads of Departments are\u2014Inspector-General of Police, of Jails, of Registration, and Superintendent of Stamps, all united in one official; Commissioner of Excise, Assam Valley, who is also Commissioner of the Division; Commissioner of Excise, Surm\u00e1 Valley and Hill Districts, who is also Inspector-General of Police, etc.; Conservator of Forests; Comptroller of Accounts; Deputy Postmaster-General; Deputy Surgeon-General, who is also Sanitary Commissioner; Inspector of Schools; and Superintending Engineer, who is also Secretary to the Chief Commissioner in the Public Works Department.\n\nThe table on the following page exhibits the revenue and expenditure of the Province under the different headings of \u2018Imperial,\u2019 \u2018Provincial,\u2019 and \u2018Local,\u2019 for the year 1880\u201381.\n\nThe police force in 1880\u201381, employed on civil duties, numbered 1529 officers and men of all ranks, besides a well drilled and armed semi-military force of 2200 officers and men maintained as frontier guards and patrols in the hill tracts and North Cachar. The total cost of this force to the imperial revenues in 1880\u201381 was \u00a378,962, the average cost being \u00a31, 14s. 10\u00bdd. per square mile of area, and 4\u00bdd. per head of the population. Very heavy duties fell upon the frontier police during the year, and they shared with the military in the risks of the expedition against the N\u00e1g\u00e1 tribes, which terminated in April 1880. The village watch, or chaukid\u00e1rs, are only found in the Districts of Sylhet, Go\u00e1lp\u00e1ra,\n\n[Sentence continued on p. 371.]\n## Statement of Imperial, Provincial, and Local Revenue and Expenditure of Assam Province for 1880\u201381\n\n### Revenue\n\n| Imperial | Provincial | Local | Total |\n|----------|------------|-------|-------|\n| \u00a3        |            |       |       |\n| Land Revenue, Tributes, Forests, Excise. | 299,309 | 74,952 | 374,261 |\n| Provincial Rates, Opium, Stamps, Registration, Minor Departments, Law and Justice, Police, Education, Medical, Stationery and Printing, Interest, Superannuation, Public Works, Miscellaneous, Provincial to Imperial Fund, Contribution, Provincial to Local Fund, Contribution, Local to Provincial Fund, Local Funds Debt Accounts, | 16,899 | 195,635 | 213,534 |\n|          |            |       |       |\n\n### Expenditure\n\n| Imperial | Provincial | Local | Total |\n|----------|------------|-------|-------|\n| \u00a3        |            |       |       |\n| Land Revenue, Excise, Provincial Rates, Stamps, Registration, Administration, Minor Departments, Law and Justice, Police, Education, Ecclesiastical, Medical, Stationery and Printing, Political Agencies, Allowances, etc., Superannuations, Famine Relief, Irrigation and Navigation, Other Public Works, Interest, Refunds, Miscellaneous, Contribution, Provincial to Imperial Fund, Contribution, Provincial to Local Fund, Contribution, Local to Provincial Fund, Local Funds Debt Accounts, | 34,464 | 54,689 | 89,153 |\n|          |            |       |       |\n\nTotal: \u00a387,582\nand Cachar; they numbered 4376 in 1880\u201381, and are supported by contributions from the villagers, estimated at \u00a310,502. A municipal police is maintained in the towns of Gauhati, Goalpara, Sibsagar, Dibrugarh, Sylhet, and Silchar, numbering 110 men, at a cost of \u00a31838.\n\nIn 1880\u201381, the total number of cognisable cases inquired into was 7209. The number of persons put on their trial was 8107, of whom 5438, or 67.06 per cent., were convicted, being one person in every 890 of the population. In addition, 13,169 non-cognisable cases were instituted, in which 9162 persons were arrested or summoned, and 5573, or 60.82 per cent., convicted. There are 10 District jails and 11 lock-ups in the Province. In 1880, the average daily prison population was 1381.94, or one person always in jail to every 3532 of the population. The daily average number of sick was 55.33, or 3.99 per cent.; the total number of deaths 76, or 55.5 per 1000. The aggregate expenditure, excluding cost of building new jails, alterations or repairs, was \u00a310,411, or \u00a37, 11s. 1d. per prisoner.\n\nThe military force employed in the Province in 1880 consisted of the 34th Regiment Native Infantry, stationed at Cachar; the 42nd Regiment Assam Light Infantry, stationed at Kohima in the Nagaland Hills; the 43rd Regiment Native Infantry, stationed at Dibrugarh; and the 44th Regiment Sylhet Light Infantry, stationed at Cachar. Total strength, 3325 officers and men. The Government Marine Service consists of four river steamers of from 200 to 350 tons burthen, a yacht for the Chief Commissioner, a flat, and a steam launch; manned by a total of 163 officers and men.\n\nEducation has only begun to make any progress in Assam within the past few years. In 1875\u201376, there were altogether 1293 schools in the Province, attended by a total of 31,462 pupils. The total expenditure was \u00a326,012, of which \u00a37584 was subscribed by the public, and the remainder granted from provincial and local funds.\n\nIn 1880\u201381, the number of Government and aided schools under inspection had slightly fallen to 1287, but the number of pupils had increased to 40,671, and the expenditure to \u00a328,741, of which the State contributed \u00a319,084, or just two-thirds. There is a Government High School in each of the eight valley Districts, and at Shillong. Also one aided and one unaided school of the same class. These eleven schools contained 1930 pupils in 1880\u201381, as against 1351 in the previous year. Out of 46 candidates, 34 successfully passed the entrance examination of the Calcutta University in December 1880. Middle-class English and vernacular schools numbered 83 in 1880\u201381, against 85 in 1879\u201380; but the pupils increased from 5420 in the latter year to 5662 in 1881. Primary schools for boys increased from 1028 with 27,635 pupils in 1879\u201380, to 1115 with 31,555 pupils in 1880\u201381; and the girls\u2019 schools,\nfrom 63 with 1072 pupils in 1879-80 to 66 with 1136 pupils in 1880-81. Normal and special schools, such as an artisan school at Jorh\u00e1t, and a survey class at Sibs\u00e1gar, numbered 12 in 1880-81, with 388 pupils.\n\nThe indigenous, or unaided and uninspected schools of the Province are schools in which the instruction is principally religious, and usually imparted orally. No complete statistics of these schools exist, although 287 such schools have been enumerated in Sylhet and 11 in Sibs\u00e1gar. Up to 1880 it had not been found practicable to induce the teachers of these schools to use the Government text-books, or to conform to the Government course of instruction; but an attempt was commenced in that year to encourage a more practical kind of secular education by a grant-in-aid system of payment by results. In Bengal, such efforts to incorporate indigenous schools into our system of public instruction have yielded most encouraging results. The Census Report returned (omitting the G\u00e1ro and N\u00e1g\u00e1 Hills) a total of 54,758 boys and 1676 girls as under instruction in the Province in 1881; besides 78,968 males and 1786 females as able to read and write, but not under instruction. Of the total male population 95\u00b73 per cent., and of the female population 99\u00b787 per cent., are returned as illiterate. There were in 1881 seven printing-presses in the Province, besides the Provincial Government Gazette. A weekly vernacular newspaper is published in Sylhet, and a monthly vernacular periodical in Sibs\u00e1gar.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of Assam, both in the Brahmaputra and Surm\u00e1 valleys, is noted for its excessive humidity. The rainy season begins about March, and after an interval of dry weather, the regular monsoon rains set in about the latter half of May, and last till the middle of October. In both the Brahmaputra and Surm\u00e1 valleys the morning fog is a special characteristic of the cold weather, especially in December and January. It rises from the river at daybreak, and often does not clear away till nearly mid-day. The prevalent direction of the wind in both valleys is from the north-east. Earthquakes are of common occurrence. In January 1869, and again in September 1875, there were shocks of great severity, which did much damage at Silchar and Gauh\u00e1t\u00ed. The average rainfall registered for a period varying in the different Districts from 7 to 20 years, ranges from 153 inches in Sylhet to 52\u00bd inches at Samaguting, and 76 inches at Tezpur in Darrang. The rainfall in the hill tracts is much heavier. Cherrapoonjee (Ch\u00e1r\u00e1-punji), in the Kh\u00e1s\u00ed Hills, enjoys the distinction of having the heaviest rainfall in all the world; the recorded average during about twenty years ending 1881 is 489 inches; but a total of 805 inches is said to have fallen in the year 1861\u2014no fewer than 366 inches having poured down within the single month of July. The average mean temperature at Silchar is about 77\u00b0 F., the range of variation being 32\u00b0. The climate of the higher ranges and plateaux in the hill tracts is very salubrious,\nthe extremes of heat and cold being both unknown. A Shillong the average maximum temperature recorded during three years was $74^\\circ21$\u00b0 F., in August; the average minimum, $38^\\circ99$\u00b0 in January. Frost and hoarfrost are common at Shillong in the winter months; but the strong southwest winds, which are extremely cold, form the peculiar winter feature. These commonly begin in December or January, and continue till the end of March. In the neighbourhood of Kohim\u00e1, snow frequently falls in winter, and the peak of Japso is often snow-capped till March.\n\nThe sanitary condition of Assam is far from satisfactory, although some improvement has recently been effected by the clearing of jungle and the enforcement of conservancy arrangements in the towns. The tract at the foot of the hills, and the valleys running up into them, are excessively malarious, especially in the Brahmaputra valley. The open country, however, is by no means unhealthy, and the tea-planting population, especially Europeans, are said to enjoy better general health than in most other parts of the plains of India. The gradual extension of cultivation appears to be the most hopeful method of driving away malaria. The most prevalent diseases are intermittent fevers, bowel complaints, cholera, small-pox, various skin disorders, and in some localities goitre. The general vital statistics of the Province are untrustworthy, although the registration of births and deaths is gradually increasing in accuracy. In 1881\u201382, an exceptionally healthy year, the registered death-rate showed a mortality of $16^\\circ04$ per thousand, as against a registered death-rate of $10^\\circ00$ per thousand in the previous five years. Vaccination has made some progress in Assam. In the year 1881\u201382, 83 vaccinators were employed under the supervision of the medical authorities. They performed 11,689 operations, chiefly in the Districts of K\u00e1mrup, Go\u00e1lp\u00e1r\u00e1, and the G\u00e1ro Hills. In the same year there were 25 charitable dispensaries in the Province, at which a total of 58,001 in-door and out-door patients were treated. The total expenditure in 1881 amounted to \u00a33022, of which Government contributed \u00a31238, inclusive of the cost of European medicines, which amounted to \u00a3270. The greater number of the cases were of malarious origin (including organic affections of the spleen and kidneys), dysentery, diarrhoea, and cutaneous disorders. The lunatic asylum for Assam at Tezpur had an average daily population of 56 in 1882.\n\nA considerable literature has of late years sprung up regarding Assam and its industries. It would be unsuitable for me to select individual publications of this class for comment, but the following are the official works which have been most useful to me in the compilation of this article:\u2014The Provincial Administration Reports, 1880 to 1883; The Assam Census Report of 1881, from which the whole population section is derived; my Statistical Account of Assam, 2 vols., Tr\u00fcbner, 1879; Robinson\u2019s Descriptive History of Assam, 1841; and Mill\u2019s Report on the\nProvince of Assam, 1854. Several excellent recent accounts of the tea industry in Assam also deserve notice.\n\nAssaye (As\u00e1i).\u2014Village and battle-field in the extreme north-east of the Niz\u00e1m's Dominions, just beyond the Ber\u00e1r frontier. Lat. $20^\\circ 15' 15''$ N., long. $75^\\circ 56' 15''$ E.; 43 miles north-east of Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d. On the 23rd September 1803, Sir Arthur Wellesley found the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, under Sindhia and Raghuj\u00ed Bhonsla, strongly posted on the tongue of land formed by the junction of the Juah and Kailn\u00e1 rivers, with their left resting on Assaye village. Their forces consisted of 16,000 disciplined infantry, of whom 10,500 had been drilled and were led by European officers; 20,000 cavalry; a noble park of artillery, 100 of the guns being served chiefly by French artillerymen; besides irregular troops,\u2014making an army of 50,000 men. General Wellesley had with him a force of only 4500 of all arms; Colonel Stevenson's force, which was to have joined him on the morrow, not yet having come up. But finding himself compelled to risk an engagement, he crossed the Kailn\u00e1 river near its junction with the Juah, and, after desperate fighting, pushed the enemy backwards down the tongue of land, and northwards across the Juah, with terrible slaughter. The battle consisted of a bayonet charge, a cavalry pursuit, a rally by the enemy, which for a time imperilled the very existence of our army, another splendid charge by our troops, and their complete victory. The fight occupied the three hottest hours of the day, after a long march of 14 miles. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 artillery was so well served by the French gunners, that General Wellesley had to leave his own behind, owing to loss of men and bullocks during the first minutes of the advance. He put himself at the head of the line, pushed the enemy across the river at the point of the bayonet, and rushed after them. But a number of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, who had thrown themselves on the ground around or under their guns, and been passed by as dead, suddenly arose and turned their artillery upon our pursuing troops. At the same time masses of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 cavalry began to close in upon our scattered regiments. General Wellesley led a magnificent cavalry charge back across the river, re-captured the guns, snatched our army from destruction, and secured the victory. A second and more bloody pursuit followed. Sindhia and Raghuj\u00ed Bhonsla had fled early in the fight, but their artillery, trained by De Boigne, stood by their guns to the last. Of the enemy, 12,000 were killed and wounded, and General Wellesley lost 1657\u2014one-third of his little force\u2014killed and wounded. Assaye proved the first overwhelming blow to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 confederacy. Sindhia's Prime Minister died of a wound received in the fight, and it was quickly followed by the battle of Argaon, and the treaty of Devag\u00e1on. A commemorative medal was struck in 1851, and presented to the few surviving officers and men. The inhabitants of the village of Assaye, close to the scene of the conflict, possess\nnumbers of muskets, jinj\u00e1ls, and small cannon balls, which have been picked up from time to time on the battle-field. Other traces of the conflict in the shape of human remains are not unfrequently discovered on the banks of the Juah, especially after freshets caused by the rains. The battle-field is best visited from Sillod, on the Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d-Ajanta road, where there is a travellers' bungalow, and from whence the village of Assaye is distant about 11 miles.\n\n**Assia.**\u2014Range of hills in Cuttack District, Bengal; containing very interesting Buddhist, Muhammadan, and Hindu remains of ancient temples, forts, caves, sculptures, etc. The principal hills are, Alamgir, with a Muhammadan mosque, built 1719 A.D.; Ud\u00e1yagiri, with two large figures of Buddha, and extensive Buddhist ruins; Ach\u00e1la Basanta, also with numerous ruins; Bar\u00e1 Dehi, the highest peak in the range; Naltigiri, with its sandal-wood trees and famous antiquities, chief among which is the Elephant Cave; and Amravati Hill, with two beautiful images of Indr\u00e1n\u00ed.\n\n**Asurgarh Fort (Ruins of).**\u2014In Purniah District, Bengal; said to be named after Asura, one of five brothers, each of whom built himself a garh or fort here. The brothers are represented as having been Domkata Br\u00e1hmans, and to have lived about 57 B.C. The real history of the fort is involved in obscurity. Asurgarh is 4 miles from Dul\u00e1lganj village, a little east of the Mah\u00e1nand\u00e1, and covers an irregular space about 1200 yards in circumference.\n\n**Atak.**\u2014Tahsil and town, R\u00e1wal Pindi District, Punjab.\u2014See Attock.\n\n**At\u00e1ri.**\u2014Village and ruins in Sar\u00e1i Sidhu tahsil of Mult\u00e1n (Mooltan) District, Punjab; 20 miles south-west of Talamba. At present an insignificant hamlet, but contains a ruined fortress, once evidently of great strength. General Cunningham identifies the site with the City of the Br\u00e1hmans, the third city taken by Alexander in his invasion of India. The citadel is 750 feet square and 35 feet high, surrounded by a ditch now almost undistinguishable, and having a central tower of 50 feet in height. On two sides stretch the remains of an ancient town, forming a massive mound covered with huge bricks, whose large size attests their great antiquity. No tradition exists as to the origin or history of these remains, and the name of the old city is quite unknown. The adjacent village of At\u00e1ri is quite modern.\n\n**At\u00e1sar\u00e1i (or Isl\u00e1mpur).**\u2014Trading village and police station in Patn\u00e1 District, Bengal. Lat. 25\u00b0 9' N., long. 85\u00b0 13' E. Centre of tobacco trade in the Behar Sub-division; thousands of maunds are brought annually from Tirh\u00fat District, and collected in large store-rooms, whence they are distributed throughout the Districts of Patn\u00e1, Gay\u00e1, and Haz\u00e1r\u00edbah.\n\n**Atch\u00e1veram (Ach\u00e1pur\u00e1m).**\u2014Village in Tanjore District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 10\u00b0 38' N., long. 79\u00b0 34' 15\" E. The pagoda is notable for its defence, in 1749, against the Tanjore army.\nAtcheepore.\u2014Village, 24 Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal.\u2014See Achipur.\n\nAteha.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Part\u00e1bgarh District, Oudh. The most northerly pargan\u00e1 in the District, comprising an area of 79 square miles, of which 41 are cultivated. The landholding class are Kanhpuri\u00e1s, who possess 60 out of the 68 villages which make up the pargan\u00e1; 3 are held by Br\u00e1hmans, 2 by K\u00e1yasths, and 3 by Muhammadans. Population (1881) 45,152, namely, Hindus 42,318, Muhammadans 2834. The northern or trans-S\u00e1i portion of the pargan\u00e1 formerly contained strong forts, now in ruins, at Ateha, Suj\u00e1kh\u00e1r, and other places. The first of these was bravely defended by the rebels in 1858.\n\nAth\u00e1rabank\u00e1.\u2014River in the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal; forms a portion of the boat route between Calcutta and the Eastern Districts, known as the Outer Sundarbans Passage. It enters the Bidy\u00e1dhari river at Port Canning, and the united stream, together with that of the Karatoy\u00e1, which also joins the Bidy\u00e1dhari at this place, flows southward through the Sundarbans as the Matla River, and falls into the Bay of Bengal under that name.\n\nAth\u00e1rabank\u00e1.\u2014River in Khuln\u00e1 District, Bengal. A cross stream connecting the Madhumat\u00ed and the Bhairab rivers.

Bounded on the north by Dhenk\u00e1n\u00e1l State; on the east by Cuttack District; on the south by the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed river, separating it from Cuttack on this side also; and on the west by the tributary States of Tigari\u00e1 and Dhenk\u00e1n\u00e1l. A low-lying level country, very subject to inundation. The cultivation consists of rice, with an occasional crop of sugar-cane. In ancient times, Athgarh belonged to the kings of Orissa, one of whom married the sister of his prime minister, and bestowed the State with the title of R\u00e1j\u00e1 on his brother-in-law. The present ruler (1883), R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sr\u00ed Karan Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed Baw\u00e1rt\u00e1 Patn\u00e1ik, is the twenty-seventh in descent, and belongs to the K\u00e1yasth or writer caste. He maintains a military force of 344 men, and a rural police of 115. The State yields him an income estimated at \u00a31620 a year; the tribute annually paid to the British Government is \u00a3280. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 supports a school, and there is another village school, or p\u00e1th\u00e1s\u00e1l\u00e1, in the State. The population of 31,079 persons\ndwells in 210 villages, and 5546 houses. The males number 15,761, and the females 15,318. Average density of the population, 185 per square mile; villages per square mile, 1.25; persons per village, 148; houses per square mile, 33; persons per house, 5.6. Classified according to religion, there were\u2014Hindus, 30,543; Muhammadans, 198; and Christians, 338. The residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 is at Athgarh village; but the principal village, and the only one in the State containing more than 100 houses, is Gobra (lat. 20\u00b0 35' 2\" N., long. 85\u00b0 22' 28\" E.). Between Gobra and Athgarh is the village of Chhagan, with a native Christian agricultural colony. The high road from Cuttack to Sambalpur passes through Athgarh State; and the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed river, which forms the southern boundary, also affords a means of communication and a trade route. At present, however, no trade is carried on.\n\nAthgarh.\u2014Village in Athgarh Tributary State, Orissa, Bengal, and residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1; situated on the Cuttack and Sambalpur road.

Post-office.\n\nAthir\u00e1la.\u2014Shrine on the Cheyair river, in Cuddapah District, Madras Presidency. The sanctity of this spot centres in the pond attached to the temple. According to local belief, its waters cleanse from the most heinous crimes, as illustrated by the purification of Par\u00e1su R\u00e1ma (one of the incarnations of Vishnu) from the sin of matricide. The festival of Sivar\u00e1tr\u00ed, celebrated here during three days in the middle of February, attracts many thousands of pilgrims. The temple has an endowment of \u00a383 per annum.\n\nAthmallik.\u2014One of the Tributary States of Orissa, Bengal, lying between 20\u00b0 36' 55\" and 21\u00b0 5' 30\" N. lat., and between 84\u00b0 18' 20\" and 84\u00b0 50' 30\" E. long.; area, 730 square miles; population (1881) 21,774.

The country is for the most part covered with dense jungle; a long range of hills, clothed with forest, runs along its southern side, parallel with the course of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed. What little cultivation there is consists of coarse rice and other inferior grains, with a few oil-seeds. The State yields its R\u00e1j\u00e1, Jagendra S\u00e1ont, an estimated income of \u00a3710; the annual tribute paid to the British Government is \u00a348. The chief maintains a military force of 360 men; he also supports a school. The population of 21,774 persons inhabits 277 villages, and 4024 houses. The males number 11,356, or 51 per cent. of the population. Average density of the population, 30 per square mile (Athmallik being the most sparsely populated of all the Orissa Tributary States); villages per square mile, 38;\npersons per village, 78; houses per square mile, 6; persons per house, 5\u00b741. The religious division of the people is returned as follows:\u2014Hindus, 16,385; Muhammadans, 78; aboriginal tribes, chiefly Gonds and Kandhs, 5311. The chief village, and the only one in the State containing more than 100 houses, is K\u00e1int\u00e1, the residence of the Chief, on the north bank of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed. No trade is carried on in the State.\n\nAthni.\u2014Sub-division of Belg\u00e1um District, Bombay Presidency.

There are several fine tanks, those of Anantasagaram and Kalavaya being specially noteworthy. The chief antiquities of the taluk are the temples at Somisilla, Kotitirtham, Kalavaya, Mahimalur, and Chijerla, the forts and pagodas of Prabhagiripatnam, and the mosque of Anamasamudrampet.\n\n**Atmakur.**\u2014Town in Nellore District, Madras Presidency. Population (1881) 3760; namely, 3094 Hindus and 666 Muhammadans. The head-quarters of the taluk of the same name. Post-office.\n\n**Atner.**\u2014Town in Betul tahsil, Betul District, Central Provinces. Population (1881) 2429; namely, Hindus, 1869; Muhammadans, 388; Jains, 101; aboriginal tribes, 71. Large weekly market, at which a considerable trade is carried on with inhabitants of the Ber\u00e1r Districts. Police station, dispensary, and good school.

Lat. 17\u00b0 25' 25\" N., long. 74\u00b0 59' E.; population (1881) 5841; namely, Hindus, 5634; Muhammadans, 194; and Jains, 13.\n\n**Atr\u00e1i.**\u2014A river of Northern Bengal, by which the waters of the T\u00edsta found their way to the Ganges before the great change in the course of the T\u00edst\u00e1 in 1787-88. Assuming its name at a point close to the northern boundary of Din\u00e1jpur, it flows in a southerly direction through that District, and then south-east through R\u00e1jsh\u00e1h\u00ed and a small portion of Pabn\u00e1, finally joining the Ganges in the latter District, having previously taken the name of the Bar\u00e1l. Since the diversion of the waters of the old T\u00edst\u00e1 into the Brahmaputra, the Atr\u00e1i has suffered considerably as a navigable channel; but in its upper reaches it still allows of the passage of boats of about 2 tons burthen during the dry season, and in the rains it is navigable by vessels of about 35 tons. The country through which it flows is level, and the stream very sluggish. Chief tributary, the Jamuna; smaller feeders, the Kastu\u00e1khari, S\u00e1tkhari\u00e1, Kh\u00e1r\u00ed, Darn\u00e1, Ir\u00e1bat\u00ed, Nagar, and Phuljhur.

Lat. 27\u00b0 40' N., long. 78\u00b0 45' 15\" E. Its surface is covered with\nfragments of statues and broken bricks of large size. Ancient coins are frequently found among the ruins. A temple of Mah\u00e1deo and five lingams stand upon the mound, and all the sculpture is of Br\u00e1hman origin. General Cunningham identifies Atranji Kher\u00e1 with the site of Pi-lo-chan-na, visited by the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Hwen Thsang in the 7th century A.D. Local tradition connects the ruins with the capital of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ben, who was defeated by Sh\u00e1hab-ud-d\u00edn Ghor\u00ed in 1193, while his fort and city were blown into the air by the Muhammadan conqueror; but many inconsistencies in the story, and especially the mention of gunpowder in the 12th century, render this tradition untrustworthy.\n\n**Atrauli.**\u2014Tahsil or Sub-division of Aligarh District, North-Western Provinces, lying along the right bank of the Ganges, and traversed by the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway. Area, 226,371 acres, of which 150,305 are cultivated, and 73,406 irrigated; population (1881) 146,536; number of villages, 306. Land revenue, \u00a329,096; total revenue, \u00a332,140.

Trade in cotton, iron, brass utensils, and local produce. Founded about the 12th century, but little is known of its local history. Centre of local disaffection during the Mutiny of 1857. The Muhammadan inhabitants, who are converted Hindus, have always had a bad reputation for turbulence; and during the rebellion, the town was in the hands of the insurgents from June till September 1857, when order was restored. Municipal income in 1880-81, \u00a3840, of which \u00a3763 was derived from octroi; expenditure, \u00a3820; average incidence of taxation, 1s. 0\u00bdd. per head of the population.\n\n**Atrauli.**\u2014Town in Hardoi District, Oudh; 11 miles north-east from Sandila.

It falls into\nthe Salw\u00edn (Salween) river at Maulmain. Narrow, deep, and sluggish; course north-west; navigable for nearly its whole length. The teak forests on the banks of the Zam\u00ed and Winraw are now nearly exhausted. There are several hot springs on the Attaran, the most important being those at Attaran Reb\u00fa, in Amherst District.\n\nAttari.\u2014Village in Tarn-t\u00e1ran tahsil, Amritsar District, Punjab, on the Grand Trunk Road, and a railway station on the Sind, Punjab, and Delhi line. Population (1881) 2853. Founded by Gaur Singh, a J\u00e1t of the Sindu tribe. His descendants, the Sird\u00e1rs of Attari, still reside in the village. The family was of great importance under the early Sikh commonwealth, and afterwards under Ranj\u00edt Singh. Their present representative, an honorary magistrate, enjoys large estates in the neighbourhood.\n\nAttigada.\u2014Estate in Ganj\u00e1m District, Madras Presidency. Area, 149 square miles.

Lat. 12\u00b0 41' N., long. 76\u00b0 33' E.; population (1881) 1347.\n\nAttili (Atri).\u2014Town in God\u00e1v\u00e1ri District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 16\u00b0 41' 10\" N., long. 81\u00b0 38' 36\" E.; population (1881) 7080; namely, 6784 Hindus, 289 Muhammadans, and 7 Christians. Houses, 1353. Situated on one of the navigable God\u00e1v\u00e1ri canals. A centre of wet-crop cultivation.\n\nAttock (Atak).\u2014Tahsil in R\u00e1wal Pindi District, Punjab, lying along the left bank of the Indus, and containing the rocky range known as the Attock Hills. Area, 568 square miles; population (1881) 138,752; namely, males, 79,629; and females, 59,123. Revenue of the tahsil (1883), \u00a312,088. The administrative staff consists of one Assistant Commissioner; one tahsild\u00e1r and 1 munsif. These officers preside over 3 civil and 2 criminal courts; with three police stations, 145 regular police, and 149 village watchmen.\n\nAttock (Atak).\u2014Town and fortress in R\u00e1wal Pindi District, Punjab, and head-quarters of Attock tahsil. Lat. 33\u00b0 53' 15\" N., long. 72\u00b0 16' 45\" E. The fort is situated on a commanding height (lat. 33\u00b0 53' 29\" N., long. 72\u00b0 17' 53\" E.) overhanging the Indus, almost opposite the point where it receives the K\u00e1b\u00fal river. Below their junction, a dangerous whirlpool eddies between two jutting precipices of black slate, known as Kam\u00e1lia and Jal\u00e1lia, from the names of two famous Roshn\u00e1i heretics, who were flung from their summits during the reign of Akbar. The buildings of the town stood formerly within the fort, but have been removed to a lower site beneath it. The Emperor Akbar here\nestablished a ferry, and built the fortress in 1583. Akbar granted the revenues of a village in Chach to be enjoyed by the Attock boatmen; this was confirmed to them by the British Government, and is still in their possession. The fort is an irregular polygon, built on the crest of the end of a spur running down to the Indus. The Muhammadan historians call it Atak Benares, in contradistinction to Katak Benares in Orissa, at the opposite extremity of the empire. Ranjit Singh occupied the post in 1813; and it remained thenceforth in the hands of the Sikhs till the British conquest in 1849. It is now held by a considerable European detachment, including a battery of artillery. Attock forms an important post on the military road to the frontier. Formerly, during eight months of the year a bridge of boats was maintained across the Indus, and for the remaining four months the passage was effected by a ferry. The bridge on the Northern State Railway from Lahore to Peshawar was completed in 1883, and the railway line to the frontier opened throughout. The bridge has a subway for goods and passenger traffic. The town, which is intersected by four main streets meeting in an open space in the centre, contains a court-house, police station, staging bungalow, two sardis, church, school-house, and dispensary. The population, which at the time of the Census of 1868 numbered 1454, had risen in 1881 to 4210, composed of 2912 Muhammadans, 1283 Hindus, 2 Sikhs, and 13 'others.' The town has been constituted a municipality of the third class; municipal revenue in 1880-81, \u00a3669; expenditure, \u00a3361.\n\nAt\u00far (Att\u00far).\u2014T\u00e1luk in Salem District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 11\u00b0 19' to 11\u00b0 52' N., long. 77\u00b0 44' to 78\u00b0 55' E.; area, 767 square miles (570,758 acres), containing 1 town and 178 villages. The acreage liable to revenue is distributed as follows:\u2014Government villages, 402,477; hill ranges, 157,933; Mitta and Shrotriem villages, 10,348 acres. The extent actually under cultivation is 107,524 acres, paying a Government revenue of \u00a320,332 in 1882-83. Population (1881) 158,554, being 76,238 males and 82,316 females. Classified according to religions, there are 152,620 Hindus, including Sivaites, Vishnuvites, and Ling\u00e1yats; 3046 Muhammadans, 2888 Christians, chiefly Roman Catholics. Four-fifths of the whole are engaged in agriculture, and very poor. Houses number 28,298 occupied and 3391 unoccupied; average number of inmates per house, 6\u00b74. The t\u00e1luk is situated in the south-east of the District. Hill ranges surround it on three sides, and the Paith\u00far Malai range runs across the t\u00e1luk, dividing it into the two watersheds of the Vell\u00e1r (or Vasishthanathi) and Sw\u00e1thanathi rivers, which water the rich grain tracts on either side. Magnetic iron beds of great extent exist in the higher hill groups. These are the Periy\u00e1 and Chinna Kalr\u00e1yan, under petty chiefs; the forests in the former are held by Government on lease. The pagoda of Kari R\u00e1man on the Periy\u00e1 Hill is a shrine of great sanctity. The soil alternates in stretches\nof red loam and black alluvium, its fertility being in many parts greatly reduced by the excessive quantity of lime contained. *Ragi* on 'dry,' and paddy on 'wet' lands, form the staple of cultivation; but other grain crops\u2014*varagu*, *kambu*, *cholam*, wheat, etc.\u2014are grown largely. Areca palms and palmyras are cultivated along the river drainage lines, and cotton occupies a large proportion of the black soil. The New Orleans plant has been tried with success. A grove of sandal-wood, flourishing near V\u00e1lap\u00e1di, disproves the opinion that that tree requires a high elevation. Irrigation is carried on from all the rivers, 75 tanks, 64 minor reservoirs, and 8561 wells; irrigated area, 14,837 acres, assessed at \u00a310,168. The rates of assessment vary on 'dry' lands from 6d. to 10s. per acre; on 'wet' lands from 3s. to 19s. The trunk road from Salem to Cuddalore intersects the *t\u00e1luk*, and there are besides 89 miles of road. The chief towns are Atur, Thamampatti, Thad\u00e1v\u00far, and Vir\u00e1g\u00e1n\u00far; four other towns have a population of over 2000. The Local Fund Board has established 7 boys' and 1 girls' schools in the *t\u00e1luk*, which have an attendance of 250 scholars; the London Mission has 2 schools; and there are besides about 100 native schools or *pi\u00e1ls*. 'Travellers' bungalows have been erected at At\u00far, V\u00e1lap\u00e1di, Thalaiv\u00e1sal. Twelve weekly and four annual fairs are held in the *t\u00e1luk*. The *t\u00e1luk* contains two criminal courts, and in civil matters is under the jurisdiction of the *munsif* at Salem. Strength of regular police force, 65 men.\n\n**Atur (Attin-ur, 'the Village by the River:' Att\u00far, Ath\u00edr).**\u2014Chief town of the *t\u00e1luk* of the same name in Salem District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 11\u00b0 35' 50\" N., long. 78\u00b0 39' E. Situated on the trunk road from Salem to Cuddalore, and on the Vasisthanathi river. Population (1881) 8334, namely, 7219 Hindus, 880 Muhammadans, and 235 Christians; houses, 1617. Head-quarters of the *tahsild\u00e1r*, and of the forest, public works, and police departments; has a charitable dispensary, post-office, travellers' bungalow, two schools, and weekly market. Cart-making, iron-smelting, and the manufacture of indigo (four factories being at work) form the chief industries. Except in grain, the town has no trade, although there is much through traffic along the trunk road. The water of the river has a bad reputation. On the north bank stands a large fort, the ramparts of cut stone, with four bomb-proof chambers. Commanding, as it did, the pass from Salem to Sankaridr\u00fag, this fort was of importance in the wars with Haidar Ali. It was captured by the British in 1768, after the surrender of Salem; and during the war with Tip\u00fa was again occupied by British troops.\n\n**Atur (Aht\u00far).**\u2014Town in Tinneveli District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 8\u00b0 37' 30\" N., long. 78\u00b0 6' 30\" E.; pop. (1881) 5744, namely, 2701 males, and 3043 females. Situated near the mouth of the Tambraparni river.\n\n**Atur.**\u2014Town in Madura District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 10\u00b0 16'\nn., long. 77\u00b0 53' E.; population (1881) 7232, namely, 5170 Hindus, 1665 Muhammadans, and 397 Christians; houses, 1224. Situated 10 miles south-west of Dindigal, in the centre of a highly cultivated tract.\n\n**Atwa Pip\u00e1ria.**\u2014*Pargan\u00e1* in Kheri District, Oudh; situated between the Kathna and Gumti rivers. A scantily populated jungle tract. On the breaking up of the great Muhamdi estate, of which it formed part, many of the sub-holders obtained direct engagements for their villages; among them the father of Bhagwant Singh, who held Atwa Pip\u00e1ria. The whole *pargan\u00e1* was subsequently engrossed by Bhagwant; but in 1836 he lost part of it. In resentment, he went into rebellion, and for several years led a life of successful robbery. He had a fort at Atwa, on the Kathna river, situated amid dense jungle, from which he used to emerge at night, and commit raids and robberies of cattle on the neighbouring Districts. Colonel Sleeman relates how on one occasion, in 1841, this man, with 200 followers, completely defeated three companies of the King of Oudh's troops under a European officer, who had been despatched to effect his capture. He was subsequently assassinated, and his head sent in triumph to the king. The estate was then put under the management of Captain Faida Husain Kh\u00e1n, an officer of the King of Oudh. On our annexation of Oudh the settlement was made with him, and a *t\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri sanad* granted, whereby he obtained a permanent and hereditary proprietary title to the *pargan\u00e1*. The estate, however, has now passed out of his hands. Area, 64 square miles, of which 23 are cultivated; population (1881) 10,575, namely, Hindus 9244, Muhammadans 1331. Land revenue, \u00a3775.\n\n**Auckland Bay.**\u2014Bay on the coast of Mergui District, British Burma. Lat. 12\u00b0 10' N., long. 98\u00b0 30' E.

Also called Baberu, *q.v.*\n\n**Aundh.**\u2014A petty State (*j\u00e1gir*) within the Sat\u00e1ra Political Agency, under the supervision of the Collector, in the Bombay Presidency, lying between 17\u00b0 6' 15\" and 17\u00b0 34' 15\" N. lat., and between 74\u00b0 16' 15\" and 74\u00b0 52' 30\" E. long.; area, 447 square miles; population (1881) 58,916, namely, Hindus 56,237, Muhammadans 2393, 'others' 286. Number of occupied houses, 8496; number of villages, 71; estimated gross revenue, inclusive of export and import duties, \u00a319,377. Products\u2014wheat, the ordinary varieties of millet and pulse, and cotton; molasses, clarified butter, and oil are also prepared. There are (1881) 19 schools (one for girls), with 723 pupils. The present chief is a Hindu of the Br\u00e1hman caste, with the title of Panth Pratinidhi. This title, meaning 'Representative of the R\u00e1j\u00e1,' or 'Viceroy,' was held, with the office, by several Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 chiefs, under the descendants of Sivaji, and eventually became hereditary in the family of the present holder. The\nj\u00e1gir is under the direct control of the Bombay Government, and its Chief ranks in the first class among the Deccan Sard\u00e1rs. He maintains a retinue of 280 armed police and 20 horsemen. He holds a sanad authorizing adoption. The family follows the rule of primogeniture; but during the last six successions either an adopted son or a sole son and heir has succeeded.\n\nAundh.\u2014Chief town of the State of Aundh, in the District of Sat\u00e1ra, Bombay Presidency; 26 miles south-east of Sat\u00e1ra.

In 1883, the tahsil contained 1 civil and 1 revenue court, with 2 police stations; strength of regular police, 52 men, with 247 village watchmen (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs).\n\nAur\u00e1iy\u00e1.\u2014Town in Et\u00e1wah District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of the tahsil; situated on the Et\u00e1wah and K\u00e1lpi road, 42 miles distant from the former town. Lat. 26\u00b0 28' N., long. 79\u00b0 33' 15\" E. Area, 428 acres. A steadily improving and prosperous town, carrying on a considerable trade with Gwalior and Jh\u00e1nsi. Population (1881) 7299, composed of 6267 Hindus, 1017 Muhammadans, and 15 Christians. A small revenue for police and conservancy purposes is raised under the provisions of the Chauk\u00edd\u00e1ri Act (xx. of 1856). The metalled road from Jh\u00e1nsi passes a little outside the town, and on it is built the tahsil\u00ed, a handsome structure. Opposite the tahsil\u00ed, a wide metalled road, lined with fine shops, runs down to the new market-place known as Humeganj, and which consists of a large well-kept square, with a central metalled roadway, and good masonry shops at the sides. The town proper comprises about 200 masonry houses, around which mud huts are closely packed. Three good s\u00e1rd\u00eds or travellers\u2019 rest-houses, two large tanks, two fine mosques, and several Hindu temples. During the Mutiny, the town was more than once at the mercy of the insurgents; it does not, however, appear to have been plundered, and it is stated that some of the more wealthy traders saved themselves from that fate by bribing the rebel leaders.\n\nAuranga.\u2014River in Surat District, Bombay Presidency, rising in the Dharampur hills, and falling into the sea about 8 miles south of the Amb\u00edka. For the last 15 miles of its course the Auranga is a tidal stream, navigable by boats of 50 tons and under for about 6 miles from\nthe sea. A mile above the town of Bals\u00e1r the railway crosses the river by a bridge 1000 feet long, and raised 32 feet above the stream. At Bals\u00e1r the channel is 600 feet wide, with a depth of from 7 to 9 feet at low tide. There is a bar at the mouth, the tidal rise over which is 18 feet.\n\n**Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d.**\u2014Sub-division of Gay\u00e1 District, Bengal, lying between 24\u00b0 29' and 25\u00b0 7' 30\" N. lat., and between 84\u00b0 2' 30\" and 84\u00b0 46' 30\" E. long.; area, 1246 square miles; population (1881) 445,641, comprising 398,070 Hindus, 47,564 Muhammadans, 3 Christians, and 4 Sant\u00e1s; density of population, 357 per square mile; number of villages, 2667; of occupied houses, 70,481. The Sub-division comprises the three police circles of Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d, D\u00e1\u00fadnagar, and N\u00e1binagar. In 1883, it contained 1 civil and 2 criminal courts; strength of regular police, 103 men; village watchmen (chauk\u00edd\u00e1rs), 843.\n\n**Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d.**\u2014Village on the Grand Trunk Road, in Gay\u00e1 District, Bengal, and head-quarters of Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d Sub-division. Lat. 24\u00b0 45' 3\" N., long. 84\u00b0 25' 2\" E. Population (1881) 4626, namely, males 2290, and females 2336. Municipal income (1881), \u00a379. The village contains, besides the usual official buildings, a school, dispensary, jail, and a distillery, at which native liquor is manufactured. The local trade consists chiefly of food-grains, oil-seeds, leather, lacquered ware, glass ware, candles, piece-goods, spices, kerosene oil, and salt.\n\n**Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Kheri District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Magdapur pargan\u00e1, on the east by the Kathna river, on the south by Sult\u00e1npur District, and on the west by the Gumti river. The town from which the pargan\u00e1 takes its name was one of the seats of the great Sayyid r\u00e1j which once governed the country from Pih\u00e1n\u00ed to the Gogra; and it was here that the Sayyids were defeated and overthrown by the Gaur Kshattriyas. The pargan\u00e1 comprises two well-defined tracts of about equal size. The western half consists of high, arid, sandy plains, dotted with the poorest class of villages; the eastern tract contains villages of the first and second classes, with a domat soil of tolerable fertility. The principal landed proprietors are Musalm\u00e1ns. Area, 116 square miles, of which 58 are cultivated. Population (1881)\u2014Hindus, 29,845; Muhammadans, 3008; total, 32,853, of whom 17,603 arc. males and 15,250 females. The metalled road from Sit\u00e1pur to Shanjah\u00e1npur runs through the pargan\u00e1. Land revenue, \u00a33705.\n\n**Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d.**\u2014Town in Kheri District, Oudh; 28 miles north-east of Sit\u00e1pur. Lat. 27\u00b0 47' N., long. 83\u00b0 27' E. Called after the Emperor Aurangzeb, in whose reign it was founded by Naw\u00e1b Sayyid Kharram. Tieffenthaler describes it as 'having a brick-built palace enclosed with a wall, and adjoining a wall of quadrangular ground plan, having hexagonal towers.' The palace, in a decayed condition, is still the residence of the descendants of the founder; but the fort is in complete ruins.\nThe walls of one of the bastions are the only part standing. Population (1881), 2016 Hindus, and 1255 Muhammadans\u2014total, 3271.\n\n**Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Sit\u00e1pur District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Misrikh pargan\u00e1, on the east by Kuraun\u00e1 pargan\u00e1, and on the south and west by the Gumti river, which separates it from Hardoi District. A new pargan\u00e1, dating from the British annexation. In Akbar's reign the lands were included in Nimkh\u00e1r, which comprised 6 large mahals. Area, 60 square miles, or 38,292 acres, thus classified:\n\n- Cultivated, 23,154; cultivable, 10,877; ma\u1e0d\u012b, 89; and barren, 4172 acres.\n- Rate of Government land revenue on cultivated area, 2s. 5\u00bdd. per acre; on assessed area, 1s. 8\u00bdd. per acre; on total area, 1s. 5\u00bcd.\n\nPopulation (1881) 21,057, namely 11,018 males and 10,039 females; number of villages, 34. The chief family is Muhammadan, owning 27 out of the 34 villages. It is noticeable that there are now no R\u00e1jput zamind\u00e1rs in the pargan\u00e1, although prior to the reign of Aurangzeb it was owned by Ponw\u00e1r R\u00e1jputs.\n\n**Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d.**\u2014Town in S\u00edt\u00e1pur District, Oudh; 4 miles east of Nims\u00e1r. The residence of t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r Mirz\u00e1 Muhammad Ali Beg, whose ancestor, Bah\u00e1dur Beg, acquired the surrounding country as a j\u00e1g\u00edr from the Emperor Aurangzeb, in whose honour he named the town. Population (1881) 3631. Large bi-weekly market, with considerable trade in cotton and salt; annual value of sales, about \u00a36600. Climate healthy; soil good. Government school.\n\n**Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d.**\u2014Town in the Dominions of the Niz\u00e1m of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, near the north-west boundary; situated on the Kaum river, a small perennial stream which takes its rise in the neighbouring hills, and a tributary of the God\u00e1vari. Lat. 19\u00b0 54' N., long. 75\u00b0 22' E. Distance from Ahmadnagar, 68 miles; from the nearest railway station, N\u00e1ndg\u00e1on, on the Great Indian Peninsula line, 56 miles; from Bombay, 175 miles; and from Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d (Hyderabad), 270 miles. The population was estimated in 1825 at 60,000, but is now returned at 20,500. Founded in A.D. 1610 by the celebrated M\u00e1lik Ambar, or S\u00edd\u00ed Ambar, as he is frequently styled, a native of Abyssinia, who rose from the condition of a slave to that of Regent of the Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1hi kingdom of Ahmadnagar. The town, which was first named Kirki by M\u00e1lik Ambar, is surrounded by masonry walls of moderate height, with semicircular bastions surmounted by towers at the different angles. It contains the ruins of many buildings, among which is a palace built by Aurangzeb, at present in a state of complete decay. The most interesting building is a mausoleum, also built by Aurangzeb, to contain the remains of a favourite wife; it is said to resemble in a feeble way the T\u00e1j Mahal at Agra. Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d was the capital of the extensive Province of that name, comprehending a considerable portion of the old Deccan (Dakshin) kingdom of Ahmadnagar. The ruins within occupy almost a\nfourth of the area of the city. A couple of miles west of the town are the ruins of a large suburb named Hars\u00fal, on the road to which is a vast stone building erected by Aurangzeb for the accommodation of travellers. A short distance to the east of the city is a group of Armenian tombs, about 50 in number, containing inscriptions in Hebrew. At Roza, about 14 miles from the city, is buried M\u00e1lik Ambar, its founder, under a dome which was erected during his lifetime. A mile to the west of the town are situated the cantonments, for a force of cavalry, artillery, and infantry; population, 9721. The Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d caves, situated in the Sichel range of hills, about 2 miles to the north of the city, have been thoroughly explored and described by Mr. Burgess, of the Archaeological Survey, in vol. iii. page 59 of the Records. Mr. Burgess divides the caves into 3 groups; the first and second groups are of Buddhistic origin, and contain 9 caves; the third group contains 3 caves, and lies about a mile to the east of the other two. Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d was at one time a considerable trading centre, but its commercial importance decreased when Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d became the capital of the Niz\u00e1m. The trade of the place has, however, revived considerably of late years, and a large traffic in wheat, cotton, and in manufactured goods and hardware, is now carried on. A Sadr T\u00e1lukd\u00e1r (Revenue Commissioner), who is also S\u00fabah, has his head-quarters here.\n\n**Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d Sayyid.**\u2014Town in Bulandshahr District, North-Western Provinces; 10 miles north-west of Bulandshahr town. Area, 168 acres. Population (1881) 5210, comprising 2693 Hindus, 2512 Muhammadans, and 5 Jains. A small municipal revenue, for police and conservancy purposes, is raised under the provisions of the Chauk\u00edd\u00e1ri Act (xx. of 1856). Post-office, school, market. Founded A.D. 1704 by Sayyid Abdul Az\u00edz, who ousted the turbulent Jaroliy\u00e1s of the neighbourhood, with the permission of Aurangzeb, and called the new town after his patron\u2019s name. Founder\u2019s family still hold this and 15 other villages. Religious fair at Sayyid Abdul\u2019s tomb. The town is surrounded by tanks, which are prejudicial to health after the rainy season. The streets are well paved and drained, and a new market-place was constructed in 1882.\n\n**Aur\u00e1s.**\u2014Village in Un\u00e1o District, Oudh; 26 miles north of Un\u00e1o town, on the road to Sandila. Lat. 26\u00b0 54\u2032 N., long. 80\u00b0 33\u2032 E. Population (1881) 969, namely, Hindus 928, and Muhammadans 41. Bi-weekly market; trade in grain, tobacco, vegetables, and English and country-made cloth. Manufactures of earthenware, and of gold and silver trinkets. Registration office.\n\n**Ausgr\u00e1m.**\u2014Considerable village, with police station, in Bardw\u00e1n District, Bengal. Lat. 23\u00b0 31\u2032 15\u2033 N., long. 87\u00b0 42\u2032 35\u2033 E.\n\n**Ava.**\u2014The former capital of the Burmese Empire; in 21\u00b0 52\u2032 N. lat., and 96\u00b0 1\u2032 E. long. It is situated on the Irawadi (Irrawaddy),\nwhich is here 3282 feet broad, and sweeps past the city on the north. The Myt-nge, a rapid stream, 450 feet wide, defends it on the east, and joins the Irawadi close under its walls. From this river a canal has been dug, through which its waters flow on the south-east angle of the city, and are again brought into the same river. The deep and rapid torrent of the Myt-tha, an offshoot of the Myt-nge, and like it falling into the Irawadi, protects the south and west sides of the town. The city is divided into the outer and the inner town, both of which are fortified. A brick wall, $15\\frac{1}{2}$ feet high by 10 feet thick, with a shallow moat in front, and a bank of earth thrown up at an angle of $45^\\circ$ behind, surrounds the whole. A second and stronger wall, 20 feet high, with a deeper and broader ditch, crossed by three causeways, and not fordable when full, and a teak-wood stockade, protect the inner town, a square containing the royal palace, council chamber, hall of justice, and arsenal. The city and suburbs have a circumference of about $5\\frac{1}{2}$ miles, but the huts of the inhabitants are scattered, and interspersed with waste spaces. Mr. Crawford stated that there were not more than half a dozen brick houses. Ava, like other Burmese towns, is adorned with numerous temples, of which the gilded spires present on a distant view a splendid and imposing appearance, which is far from being realized on a nearer inspection. The largest of these temples contains two distinct edifices, one in the ancient, the other in a modern form; the former contains an image of Gautama, not of marble, as Syme supposes, but of sandstone. It is in a sitting posture, and is 24 feet in height. The head is 8 feet in diameter. The temple called Maong-Ratna is celebrated as the one in which the public officers take, with solemn forms, the oath of allegiance. The temple called Mahamrat-muni was famous for its gilded pillars and splendid ceiling. Ava contains 11 markets or b\u00e1z\u00e1rs, composed of thatched huts and sheds, well supplied with country produce, and exhibiting for sale the wares of China and Lao, side by side with Manchester piece-goods and British woollens, earthenware, glass, etc. The town is in a declining state, and has no local industries of any importance. Ava comprehends, according to the political divisions of the Burmese Empire, the town Sagaing, on the opposite shore of the Irawadi, and the town of Amarapura, 4 miles to the east. Sagaing extends along the bank of the Irawadi for more than a mile and a half, but is of inconsiderable breadth. It consists of mean houses thinly scattered among gardens and orchards, the principal trees in the latter consisting of fine old tamarinds. On the site of the town and its environs are innumerable temples, some of them old and ruinous, others modern. On the river face there is a brick wall about 10 feet in height, with parapet and embrasures, like that of Ava, and extending more than half a mile along the river. Ava was founded in 1364, and was, with\ninterruptions, the usual capital until the foundation of Amarapura, in 1783. It was again made the capital from 1822 to 1837-38. Since that date its importance has steadily declined. To each of the towns of Ava, Sagaing, and Amarapura are attached Districts, the two former of which extend 12 miles along the river, and are of equal breadth. The District of Amarapura is of similar size, so that Ava must be considered as not only the name of the former capital, but also of a large District, which covers an area of 288 miles, with a population estimated at 354,200 inhabitants. The city of Ava itself, when the capital, was supposed to contain not more than 50,000 inhabitants; and, according to Mr. Crawford, half that number would be nearer the truth. In 1755, it had but 8000 or 9000 inhabitants, and has now probably fewer. [Ava, as a city beyond British India, lies outside the scope of this work. The foregoing brief description has therefore been condensed from the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Colonel Yule, C.B., has also favoured me with some later information, which I have incorporated; but for fuller information his own work should be consulted; also pp. 257 to 309 of vol. i. of the British Burma Gazetteer.]\n\nAv\u00e1ni.\u2014Village of great sanctity in Kol\u00e1r District, Mysore State.

Highest peak, Av\u00falapali Dr\u00fag (3850 feet), at the point of junction of the Districts of Cuddapah and North Arcot with Mysore territory.\n\nAwah.\u2014Town in Etah District, North-Western Provinces; 12 miles east of Jaiesar, on the road from Agra to Etah. Lat. 27\u00b0 27' 2\" N., long. 78\u00b0 31' 47\" E.; area, 76 acres; population (1881) 5679, comprising 4357 Hindus, 918 Muhammadans, 400 Jains, and 4 Christians. The town has been constituted a municipality under the provisions of Act xx. of 1856.\n\nAwar.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 of Jh\u00e1l\u00e1war State, under the Western M\u00e1lwa Agency of Central India.\n\nAyakott\u00e1 (Tiacotay, Jacotta, Aikota, Ayikod, Ayakkad).\u2014Town in Malabar District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 10\u00b0 37' 15\" N., long. 76\u00b0 31' 15\" E.; population (1881) 9211; namely, Hindus, 7284; Muhammadans, 1922; Christians, 5; number of houses, 1696. Situated at the northern extremity of the island of Vaipin ('Vypeen'), 15 miles north from Cochin. A town of considerable antiquity, tradition relating that St. Thomas landed here. Until the cession of the Dutch Indies, it belonged to Holland. During the war with Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n it was considered a point of strategical importance.\n\nAyak\u00fadi.\u2014An estate (zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri) in Mad\u00fara District, Madras Presidency; area, 27,277 acres. The Government land tax yields \u00a31678.\n\nAyak\u00fadi.\u2014Town in Mad\u00fara District, Madras Presidency. Lat. 10\u00b0 26' 45\" N., long. 77\u00b0 35' 30\" E. Situated about 34 miles north-west by west from Dindigal on the road to P\u00e1lgh\u00e1t. Population (1881) 10,617, being 9291 Hindus, 1140 Muhammadans, and 186 Christians; houses, 2349. Ayak\u00fadi is the head-quarters of the estate (zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri) of the same name.\n\nAyyankere, or Dodda Madaga-kere.\u2014An artificial lake at the eastern base of the B\u00e1ba B\u00fadan Hills, in Kad\u00far District, Mysore State, formed by embanking the Veda river. Circumference, 7 miles; length of embankment, 1700 feet; greatest depth of water, 35 feet. The contents have been estimated at 207,900 cubic feet of water. The construction of this work is assigned to Rukmangada R\u00e1ya, a legendary king of Sakar\u00e1ypatna, and many traditions are connected with it. A shrine on the embankment contains an inscription dating back to the 13th century. The lake is studded with islands, and forms a scene of great beauty; but the outlets have fallen into disrepair, and now irrigate only 300 acres.\n\nAzamgarh.\u2014District of the Benares Division, in the Lieutenant-Governorship of the North-Western Provinces, lying between 25\u00b0 38' and 26\u00b0 25' N. lat., and 82\u00b0 42' and 83\u00b0 49' E. long.; area, 2147 square miles; population in 1881, 1,604,654. Bounded on the north by\nFaiz\u00e1b\u00e1d and Gorakhpur Districts; east, by the new District of Ballia; south, by Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur District; and west, by Jaunpur and Sult\u00e1npur. The administrative head-quarters of the District are at Azamgarh, which is also the chief town.\n\nPhysical Aspects.\u2014The District forms part of the Gangetic plain, and in general shape is an irregular quadrangle. It has an almost uniform height of 255 feet above the sea, the flatness of its surface being relieved only by the occasional difference of elevation between the old and the recent alluvial deposits of which its soil is composed, and by the ravines cut deeply into those soft strata by its numerous streams. As it has a gentle slope towards the south-east, the main drainage channels run in that direction. A natural line running east and west, and formed by the Kunw\u00e1r n\u00e1di and the Tons river, cuts off the southernmost third of the District from the rest, and demarcates with some distinctness a natural division in the soil. The southern portion consists entirely of the old alluvium typical of the Gangetic plain. The northern has in great part been formed by the more recent silting of the rivers in their later course. The southern portion is cut into strips lying east and west, by a series of swamps and watercourses, and abounds in lakes. These in the rainy season combine\u2014especially in the south-west\u2014to form extensive marsh lands, from which stand out the more elevated portions studded with villages, groves, and crops. Nowhere does any long continuous expanse of cultivation occur, marshes and saline plains (\u00fasar) interrupting the crop lands. In the northern portion of the District, the old and new alluvial soils divide the area between them nearly equally; but the watercourses here keep more closely to their channels, the swamps are less frequent, the expanses of cultivation more continuous, and hamlets with their attendant groves more thickly scattered. Usar or reh patches, lands efflorescing with salts, are very prevalent throughout the District; and though reclaimable, the process is costly and laborious. These, with the swamps, the occasional sand-beds, and the ravines, which, being overgrown with dh\u00e1k and bab\u00fal jungle, defy cultivation, bring up the total barren area of the District to 371,563 acres, or more than a quarter of the whole. The principal river is the Gogra (Gh\u00e1gra) or Great Sarju, known also as the Deoha or Dehwa. Its valley varies in width from half a mile to ten miles, and within this the river is constantly shifting its channel. When in flood, it rolls along in an enormous volume of water, cutting its way deeply through the soft soil, and depositing along its course a sediment of sterile sand. The Tons river enters the District near M\u00e1h\u00fal, and after a very tortuous course of some 30 miles, during which it receives several affluents, makes its way south-east till it reaches Azamgarh; here it turns northward again, making a loop, in which the town stands, and then returns\nto its south-easterly course, which it maintains till it leaves the District near Mau (Mhow). The other rivers of the District are the Chhot\u00e1 Sarju, Pharai, Basnai, Nangai, Gangi, Besu; and the Kunw\u00e1r, Ungri, M\u00e1jhui, Sil\u00e1n\u00ed, Kay\u00e1r, and Suksui, the affluents of the Tons. There are about 20 large lakes (t\u00e1ls) or swamps (jh\u00edls) in the District, the principal being the Gamh\u00edran, Kotail, Jamb\u00e1wan, Gum\u00e1dih, Koila, Salona, Pakri-Pewa, Narja, and Ratoi. They abound in fish\u2014the rohu, bachua, and others. Among the mammalia are the nilg\u00e1i, wolf, boar, wild-cat, jackal, fox, and the common rodents. The complete absence of the antelope tribe is, however, noteworthy. Innumerable wildfowl of several species frequent or breed in the marsh lands, among them being the bean goose and the whistling teal. The trees are the mango, n\u00edm, pipal, tamarind, sirsa, g\u00falar, shisham, etc. The only mineral of importance is kankar, a nodular limestone largely used for road-making.\n\nHistory.\u2014Tradition points to the R\u00e1jbhars, Suir\u00eds, Seng\u00e1rias, and Cher\u00fas as the aboriginal inhabitants of the District. The R\u00e1jbhars, or Bhars, in particular, are said to have at one time had possession of the greater part of the District. Three waves of invasion swept over the District. First came the R\u00e1jputs, who wrested the soil from the Bhars. The Bhuinh\u00e1rs, a people of doubtful origin, followed. They claim to be pure Br\u00e1hmans, but their neighbours assign to them either a Kshattriya or a mixed Br\u00e1hman and Kshattriya descent. One thing is certain, the Bhuinh\u00e1rs supplanted the R\u00e1jputs over the greater part of the District, as the numerous colonies still flourishing on their original sites attest. When the tide of Muhammadan conquest flowed eastwards, Azamgarh passed with the neighbouring country under the Delhi rule. At the end of the 14th century, Jaunpur established its independence, and the Sharki kings of that city usurped authority over Azamgarh. On the fall of their dynasty, the District was re-annexed to the Delhi dominions, and the fort of Sikandarpur was built by, and named after, Sikandar L\u00f3dhi. For many years the District remained peaceably under the Emperors of Delhi; but early in the 17th century, the Gautam family of R\u00e1jputs rose to influence, and before the close of the century they had by force of arms possessed themselves of the entire District, M\u00e1h\u00fal excepted. The fortunes of this house were founded about 1600 by Abh\u00edm\u00e1n Chandra Sen, who became a Muhammadan, and in the service of Akbar grew rich enough to purchase the estate of Daulat\u00e1b\u00e1d in Azamgarh District. His descendants, and those of his brother, systematically plundered their neighbours, wresting their estates from them one by one, until, at the beginning of the 18th century, all the country lying between the Gumti river and the present Gh\u00e1zipur District was held by the family. The Kh\u00e1n-Kh\u00e1n\u00e1n of Jaunpur, a great\nfeudatory of the Lucknow viceroyalty, still, however, claimed authority over the District, and received from it a yearly revenue of \u00a36000. But early in the 18th century, Mah\u00e1bat Kh\u00e1n, the Azamgarh chief, refused payment, fortified his capital, and, marching out to meet the Jaunpur forces sent to enforce his submission, completely defeated them at Til\u00e1sra. Jaunpur, now invaded in its turn, appealed to Lucknow for assistance, and Sa\u00e1dat Kh\u00e1n, the Viceroy of Oudh, led a large army against Mah\u00e1bat Kh\u00e1n. He fled to Gorakhpur, but was captured, and with him fell the political power of his house. Three members of the family nominally succeeded to his position, but under them all the estates in Jaunpur and Gh\u00e1zipur were gradually lost, until at last they became freebooters in the District they had once ruled.\n\nIn 1758, Azamgarh was formally constituted a chakl\u00e1 of Oudh, and assimilated in internal administration with the rest of that territory; and except for the disturbances created by the outlaw N\u00e1dir Kh\u00e1n, an adopted member of the family of Chandra Sen, it remained peaceably under the Waz\u00edrs of Lucknow until 1801. In that year, the District, yielding a revenue of \u00a336,400, was ceded to the Company, together with other territory, in commutation of the military subsidy and other charges till then borne by the Lucknow treasury. N\u00e1dir Kh\u00e1n unsuccessfully sued the Company for the lands formerly held by his family; but the family title of R\u00e1j\u00e1, with a pension, was conferred on his sons, and both are still enjoyed by the representative of the house.\n\nFrom 1801 to 1857, the District has no history apart from the North-Western Provinces. In the latter year it was a centre of mutiny. On the 3rd of June 1857, the 17th Regiment of Native Infantry mutinied at Azamgarh, murdered some of their officers, and carried off the Government treasure to Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d. The Europeans fled to Gh\u00e1zipur, but on June 16th, Messrs. Venables and Dunne returned to Azamgarh, and, troops being sent from Gh\u00e1zipur, the town was reoccupied. On the 18th July, the civil officers returned to the station; and Mr. Venables attacked the rebels, but was forced back on the city, and on the 28th, after the mutiny at Dinapur, all the Europeans returned to Gh\u00e1zipur. The Palw\u00e1rs held Azamgarh city from the 9th to the 25th August; but they were expelled by the loyal Gurkh\u00e1s on the 26th, and on the 3rd September the civil officers returned again. On the 20th, Beni M\u00e1dhu and the Palw\u00e1rs were defeated, and our authority to a great extent re-established. The rebels were driven out of Atraulia in November, and in January 1858 the Gurkh\u00e1s under Jang Bah\u00e1dur marched from Gorakhpur towards Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d, driving the rebels back into Azamgarh. Kuar Singh entered the District in his flight from Lucknow in the middle of February, and was attacked by our troops at Atraulia; but the latter were defeated and fell back on Azamgarh, which was besieged by Kuar Singh till the middle of April,\nwhen he was defeated by a force under Sir E. Lugard, and the siege raised. Kuar Singh fled the District, and lost his life in crossing the Ganges; but bands of rebels roamed about, attacking the tahsilis and th\u00e1n\u00e1s till October, when a force under Colonel Kelly was sent to clear the District.\n\nArchaeology.\u2014Ruins of numerous forts are found both in this and Ballia District, which are attributed to the Bhars, the ancient rulers and inhabitants of this part of the country. Some of them are of vast size, but the builders' names as well as the dates of their erection are unknown. The largest is that at Ghosi, said to have been built by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Ghos with the help of demons. To the same agency are attributed a large excavation from the Kunw\u00e1r to the Nangai rivers, and a tunnel from the Bindraban fort running for a mile into the Narja T\u00e1l. In Mahar\u00e1jganj, in pargan\u00e1 Gop\u00e1lpur, there is an old shrine of Bhairo, which is said to have formed the eastern gate of Ajodhy\u00e1, in the traditional period when that city had four gates, each 42 kos distant from it.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1872 returned the total population of Azamgarh at 1,531,482, distributed over 2565 square miles, or 1,317,626 on the present reduced area (2147 square miles) of the District. The latest Census in 1881 returned a total population of 1,604,654, showing an increase of 287,028, or 17\u00b78 per cent., in the nine years. The male population in 1881 numbered 816,429, and the female 788,225; proportion of males in total population, 50\u00b79 per cent. Total area of District, 2147\u00b74 square miles; average density of population, 747\u00b72 per square mile; number of towns and villages, 4641; number of occupied houses, 245,336; number of villages per square mile, 21; houses per square mile, 114\u00b72; inmates per house, 6\u00b75. Of the inhabitants, classified according to religion, 1,393,387 were Hindus, 211,190 Muhammadans, and 77 Christians. The two highest castes were Br\u00e1hmans, 108,769, and R\u00e1jputs or Th\u00e1kurs, 124,867, forming together nearly 18 per cent. of the total population. The baniy\u00e1 caste numbered 5674, and the K\u00e1yasth or writer caste, 15,817. The governing body of landowners is generally derived from the highest castes and the Ah\u00edrs (253,229). The Bhuinh\u00e1rs (52,947) form a noteworthy element in the District population; they abound in pargan\u00e1s Deog\u00e1on, Niz\u00e1m\u00e1b\u00e1d, M\u00e1h\u00fal, S\u00e1gri, Ghosi, and Muhammad\u00e1b\u00e1d. The well-to-do peasants are generally K\u00farm\u00eds (35,542) and Koer\u00eds (64,204); and on a par with them may be placed the artisans, namely Barh\u00e1is or carpenters (9960), Kumbhars or potters (29,377), Loh\u00e1rs or blacksmiths (27,174), and Son\u00e1rs or goldsmiths (7790). The Bhars, the earliest aboriginal inhabitants of the Districts, numbered 77,942. Other Hindu castes\u2014Loni\u00e1s, salt-makers by caste, but now principally labourers (56,566); Kah\u00e1rs, domestic\nservants, palanquin bearers, and labourers (46,147); Mallas, boatmen (30,926); Tel\u00eds, oilmen (26,924); Dhobis, washermen (14,244); Kalw\u00e1rs, distillers (18,592); N\u00e1is, barbers (13,025); Tambul\u00eds, betel-sellers (10,371); Gadari\u00e1s, shepherds (8353). Lowest in the scale are the Cham\u00e1rs (259,816), the most numerous caste in the District; P\u00e1s\u00eds (20,627), Doms (1349), etc. Trades-unions are represented in the District by the caste panch\u00e1yats, or consultative assemblies. When an enhancement of rent is threatened, the cultivators sometimes league together in a general defence fund, subscribing so much per plough towards the expenses of litigation. Baniy\u00e1s, goldsmiths, cloth merchants, and other guilds have in the same way panch\u00e1yats which regulate their trade customs. The eight towns in the District containing over 5000 inhabitants are\u2014(1) Azamgarh, population 18,528, area 1374 acres; (2) Mau, population 14,945, area 261 acres; (3) Mubarakpur, population 13,157, area 276 acres; (4) Muhammadabad, population 9154, area 199 acres; (5) Dubari, population 7502, area 127 acres; (6) Kopaganj, population 6301, area 147 acres; (7) Walidpur, population 5343, area 145 acres; and (8) Sarai Mir, population 5238, area 98 acres. These eight chief towns contain, therefore, a total of 80,168 inhabitants, or only 5 per cent. of the District population. Of the 4641 villages and towns, 2250 had a population of less than 200; 1472 between 200 and 500; 645 between 500 and 1000; 226 between 1000 and 2000; 40 between 2000 and 5000; 5 between 5000 and 10,000; and 3 between 10,000 and 20,000. Owing to the immense majority being agricultural, and to the minute sub-division of land, the population is uniformly distributed. The mass of it consists of the very poorest cultivating class, living from hand to mouth on the day's earnings. From the comparative healthiness of the District, and its immunity from severe famines, it has become over-populated, and the standard of subsistence is very low. In the whole District there are only 496 houses built by skilled artisans; the remainder are constructed of layers of mud, added one on the other as each dries. The labourers receive 3\u00bdd. per diem for this work, and the total cost of such a house is about \u00a31. The cultivator's effects, which as a rule consist of a brass drinking vessel, a bedstead, a blanket, a quilt, and a few earthen pots, may be roughly valued at 10s. or 12s. Among the Hindus of the District, the cost of living for a family of four persons (man, woman, and two children) would be approximately\u2014(1) for those in the first class, having incomes of over \u00a3100 a year, \u00a396 to \u00a3180; (2) for those in the second class, having incomes between \u00a325 and \u00a3100 a year, about \u00a324 to \u00a360; and (3) for those in the third class, or with incomes under \u00a325 a year, from \u00a36 to \u00a312. For the Musalm\u00e1ns it would be rather higher, as their habits are more expensive. Out of the total population of nearly one and two-\nthird million, 36,891 males and 503 females were officially returned as able to read and write in 1881. Classified according to occupation, the Census Report returned the male population under the following six main groups:\u2014Class (1) professional, 4430; (2) domestic, 1930; (3) commercial, 10,350; (4) agricultural, 416,198; (5) industrial and manufacturing, 57,933; (6) indefinite and non-productive, including male children, general labourers, and unspecified, 325,588.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014The soil is alluvial throughout, being partly b\u00e1ngar (the old) and partly kachh\u00e1r (the new deposit), with the transition from the one to the other generally marked by some change of elevation in the surface. The b\u00e1ngar land, although both reh and kankar occur more frequently in it than in the kachh\u00e1r, is the more fertile of the two. The sub-soil strata are sands and clays, the former sometimes coming to the surface in the patches called b\u00e1lui. Water is met with at a few feet beneath these sandy strata, but owing to the looseness of the soil the wells have to be lined with masonry, to prevent them from falling in. The clays are of three kinds,\u2014the clear grey or bluish grey, called mati\u00e1ri, containing but little organic matter; the black clay, called kar\u00e1il, heavy, sticky, very tenacious of moisture, and the most fertile of all the soils of the District; the light clay, called kabsa, contains a saline matter, and forms in fact the transition soil between the raised sandy wastes, on which it always borders, and the heavier clays of the more depressed portions. The waste tracts of the District generally lie on the higher levels, and owe their sterility to the presence of reh, a saline efflorescence which crystallizes on the surface of the soil during the hot months. This \u00fasar or reh land can, however, with labour, be reclaimed; for if it be well trenched during the rains, and mixed with uninfected soil, the reh dies out in time, and even after the first year the reclaimed surface will yield a crop of rice. If, however, the surface drainage from the adjoining reh-infected parts be admitted to it, the improving patch rapidly lapses into its original sterility. Much of the present rice land was once, no doubt, \u00fasar land; and if the wholesome water were to be drained off them, would at once revert. In some places, extensive beds of kankar (limestone in course of formation) underlie the surface in solid sheets of coherent rock. The thin layers of soil that cover such reefs alternate, according to the season, between parched, dusty plains, and swamps. Agriculture in this District is specially dependent upon a seasonable distribution of the rainfall. The total agricultural population in 1881 was 1,293,089, or 80\u00b76 per cent. of the inhabitants of the District. The two great harvests of the year are the kharif or autumn, and the rabi or spring crop. Including two-crop land, the total area cultivated in 1881-82 was 889,942 acres, the principal crops being as follow:\u2014Kharif\u2014rice, 274,706 acres; arhar, 52,379; Indian corn, 10,550; other food\ncrops, 40,589; sugar-cane, 75,310; indigo, 10,790: total kharif area, 467,389 acres. Rabi\u2014wheat, 17,934 acres; barley, 235,078; wheat and barley mixed, 39,401; barley and gram, 18,641; peas, 87,277 other food crops, 22,055; miscellaneous non-food crops, 12,167: total rabi area, 422,553 acres. Of the total area under cultivation, about five eighths, or 576,355 acres, are irrigated, 264,047 acres from wells, and 312,308 acres from other sources. There are no Government canals or irrigation works in the District. Of the total area of 2147 square miles, 2139 square miles were assessed for Government revenue. Of this, 1269 square miles were under cultivation, and 353 cultivable, the remainder being uncultivable waste. Average area of cultivated and cultivable land per head of agricultural population, 0.79 acre. Amount of Government land revenue, including local rates and cesses upon land, \u00a3204,114, or an average of 5s. per cultivated acre. Amount of rent actually paid by cultivators, including cesses, \u00a3362,204. The land tenures are those of the North-Western Provinces generally: (1) Zamin-dari, villages held in joint possession with no actual division of the estate; (2) pattidari, where the land has been divided, and is held by several owners separately, but under a joint responsibility for the land revenue; (3) 'imperfect pattidari,' where the two sets of circumstances meet in the same estate; (4) bhayachara, where, though the tenure is pattidari, the rights and interests of each co-sharer are not determined by his ancestral share, but by custom or possession. In all these classes of estates, the settlement of the revenue to be paid to Government is a joint settlement, i.e., all the co-sharers are jointly and severally responsible for payment of the assessment, and the entire estate is liable for the whole of the revenue.\n\nThe cultivated land may be divided into three classes,\u2014(1) The sir land, or home farm, kept by the owner for his own cultivation; (2) the land held by tenants-at-will on terminable leases; (3) the land held by tenants with rights of occupancy. The last are generally old proprietors or relatives or dependants of old proprietors, and their privileges can be acquired by inheritance only. The last settlement of the land revenue for a period of 30 years was commenced in 1868, and concluded in 1877. It resulted in an increase of revenue of \u00a336,505 a year. The bankers and large traders are chiefly baniyas and Kshattriya mahajans, who send produce to Patna, Mirzapur, Calcutta, etc., and have agents at each mart. The rates of interest charged are as follow:\u2014In small transactions, on the security of personal effects, from 12 to 15 per cent.; and on personal security only, from 18 to 37\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) per cent. In large transactions, on the security of valuables, 6 to 12 per cent., and on land, 9 to 18 per cent. The rates of wages are as follow:\u2014Coolies and unskilled labourers, 2d. to 3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d. a day; agricultural labourers, 2d. to 3d.; bricklayers and\ncarpenters, from 6d. to 2s. a day. The average current prices of food during 1882 were\u2014wheat, 19 lbs. for a shilling; rice (best), 10 lbs. and (common) 19 lbs.; barley, 38 lbs.; jo\u00e1r, 38 lbs.; and d\u00e1l, 22 lbs.\n\nNatural Calamities.\u2014During the present century, no drought so severe as to cause deaths by starvation, or to force the people to leave their homes, has been known in the District. In 1782\u201383, there was so serious a scarcity that deaths from starvation occurred in the town of Mau, and a mosque and some wells built as relief works in the town of Kopaganj form memorials of the year. Wheat, nevertheless, sold throughout this \u2018famine\u2019 at 14 lbs. for the shilling. In 1818, an extraordinary hailstorm ruined the crops; and in 1819, the frost destroyed the spring crops. In 1837\u201338, there was a scarcity in parts; and in 1869, wheat was selling at 11 lbs. for the shilling. In 1873, the winter rice crop was lost from want of rain. Partial droughts also occurred in 1859\u201360, 1864\u201365\u201366, 1877\u201378; and floods in 1871\u201372.\n\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014Trade in Azamgarh has many lines of ingress and egress, both by road and river. The chief is the Gogra river, a cheap highway for both import and export, bringing in grain from the north and west, and carrying out sugar to Bengal and the east. The principal roads in the District radiate from the town of Azamgarh to Gh\u00e1zipur, Jaunpur, Gorakhpur, Benares, and Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d, the two first being main feeders of the Oudh and the East Indian Railways respectively. They are bridged and metalled throughout, with the exception of the Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d road. A network of unmetalled roads connects these main communications at numerous points, and brings to them the produce of the remoter hamlets, carried in packloads on the backs of bullocks, buffaloes, and ponies. Total length of roads, 670\u00bd miles. Sugar, molasses, indigo, opium, coarse cloths, and firewood, constitute the bulk of the exports; the District importing in exchange, grain, English-made cloth and threads, raw cotton, silk, tobacco, salt, hardware, drugs, leather goods, and millstones and stone sugar-presses from Chan\u00e1r. Formerly, Azamgarh enjoyed a large trade in refined sugar with Europe via Calcutta, but this has died out. The trade with other parts of India now amounts to about 45,000 tons a year. About 400 indigo factories (4 being European) exist in name, but the industry is not prosperous, and many of the concerns have altogether ceased work. All the native indigo factories have been started since 1857. Forty fairs are annually held in the District, the chief being those of Darb\u00e1s\u00e1, Bhairok\u00e1-asth\u00e1n-Deolas, and Dohrigh\u00e1t. The last is a bathing festival as well as a trading fair. There are no local manufactures of importance. In bargan\u00e1 M\u00e1h\u00fal, particularly tapp\u00e1 Did\u00e1rganj, considerable deposits of chloride of sodium occur, but the manufacture of salt and saltpetre is prohibited.\nAdministration.\u2014The District forms part of the Benares Division, and is controlled in revenue and police matters by the Commissioner of Benares; in judicial matters it forms a civil and sessions judgeship by itself. The District staff generally consists of a magistrate-collector, a joint-magistrate, an assistant-magistrate, an uncovenanted deputy-magistrate and collector; together with a District superintendent of police, 5 tahsildars or sub-magistrates and sub-collectors of revenue sub-divisions, a sub-deputy opium agent, and 3 honorary special magistrates with local powers. The civil courts are under the control of a civil and sessions judge, who also supervises the criminal courts. Subordinate to him are one sub-judge and two munsifs, stationed at Azamgarh and Muhammadabad. For the purpose of collecting the land revenue, the District is divided into the five tahsils of Azamgarh, Deog\u00e1n, M\u00e1h\u00fal, S\u00e1gri, and Muhammadabad.\n\nThe total revenue of the District, as at present constituted, allowing for the separation of the tract forming part of the new District of Ballia, including imperial, municipal, and local funds, amounted in 1875 to \u00a3228,991, of which the land revenue yielded \u00a3166,497. The gross imperial revenue in 1880\u201381 amounted to \u00a3189,236, of which \u00a3165,926, or 80 per cent., was derived from the land. The total cost of officials and police of all kinds in the same year was \u00a322,243.\n\nThe regular police force of the District in 1880 numbered 456 officers and men, besides a municipal or town police of 142 of all ranks, maintained at a cost of \u00a36780, of which \u00a36048 was contributed from provincial and \u00a3732 from local funds. These figures give one constable to every 3\u00bd square miles of the District area, and one to every 2688 of the population. Besides these, there were 2229 village police maintained by the landholders at an estimated cost of \u00a38047. The District jail at Azamgarh contained during 1880 a daily average of 262\u00b760 prisoners (240\u00b735 being males). The postal administration centres at Azamgarh, the number of local post-offices in the District being 18. There are no telegraph offices. Education was carried on by 169 Government aided or inspected schools, with a total attendance on March 31st, 1882, of 6834 pupils. These figures are exclusive of unaided and uninspected schools, regarding which no returns are available; but the Census report of 1881 returns 8915 boys and 168 girls as under instruction, with a total of 36,891 males as being able to read and write out of a total male population of 816,429, and 508 females out of a total female population of 788,225.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The District is on the whole a healthy one; but fever is prevalent during the rains and immediately after them. These begin in normal years in the third week of June and end in September, the first burst coming sometimes from the north-east, sometimes from the north-west. During the rains, the temperature varies from 75\u00b0\nto 95\u00b0 F. in the shade. The cool season begins about the middle of October and continues till March, the wind during these months being generally from the west, but sometimes from the east, and then often accompanied with rain. There are occasionally frosts, which, as in 1819, cause most serious damage to the crops; and also, as in 1818, hailstorms. The hot season lasts through April, May, and most of June; the thermometer ranges to 110\u00b0 F. in the shade. Westerly winds blow steadily till the middle of May, when easterly winds set in, and the climate becomes very relaxing. The average rainfall for about 30 years ending 1880 is returned at 39'73 inches, the maximum being 57'1 in 1871, and the minimum 20'8 in 1859. The total number of deaths 'reported' in 1880 was 28,562, or 17'81 per 1000. There are 2 dispensaries, at Azamgarh and Mau. During 1881 the aggregate number of out-door patients was 16,493, of in-door 668. The number of persons vaccinated in 1880-81 was 16,438.

Area, 442 square miles, of which 248 are cultivated; population (1881) 278,611; land revenue, \u00a340,684; total revenue, \u00a344,252; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a378,744. The tahsil contained, in 1883, 3 civil and 6 criminal courts, with 4 police stations and 1 outpost; strength of regular police, 58 men; 389 village watchmen or chaukid\u00e1rs.\n\nAzamgarh.\u2014Town and municipality, and head-quarters of Azamgarh District, North-Western Provinces. Situated on the river Tons, 81 miles north of Benares, 109 miles north-east of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, and 171 miles south-east of Lucknow. Lat. 26\u00b0 3' N., long. 83\u00b0 13' 20\" E.; area, 1374 acres; population (1881) 18,528, comprising 12,045 Hindus, 6,410 Muhammedans, and 73 Christians. Founded about the year 1665 by Azam Kh\u00e1n, a powerful landholder of the neighbourhood. During the Mutiny of 1857, the 17th Native Infantry murdered their officers and carried off the treasure to Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d. The Europeans at Azamgarh were twice compelled to take refuge at Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur, and Kuar Singh, on his retreat from Lucknow in February 1858, laid siege to Azamgarh, but fled on the arrival of Sir E. Lugard in April. Local centre for trade, en route for the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway at Jaunpur. Government offices, jail, post-office, dispensary. Municipal revenue in 1881, \u00a33346; expenditure, \u00a32225.\n\nAzim\u00e1b\u00e1d.\u2014Quarter of Patna City.\u2014See Patna.\nAzimganj.\u2014Village on the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed river in Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bengal, once regarded as a suburb of Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d city. Lat. 24\u00b0 14' 20\" N., long. 88\u00b0 18' 1\" E. Distance from N\u00e1lh\u00e1ti, 27 miles. Terminus of the N\u00e1lh\u00e1ti State Railway, and a great centre of passenger traffic. Some of the merchants of Jiaganj and Bhagwangola reside here; and the village also contains a thriving colony of Osw\u00e1l and M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri (up-country) traders, who are all Jains. Their handsome temples are conspicuous from the river.\n\nAzimganj.\u2014Village of minor importance, also in Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bengal, situated in Jalang\u00ed th\u00e1n\u00e1 (police circle), in the headquarters Sub-division. Lat. 24\u00b0 7' 20\" N., long. 88\u00b0 35' 46\" E. Seat of a munsif, or subordinate civil court.\n\nAzmeriganj (Ajmeriganj).\u2014Village in the Habiganj Sub-division of Sylhet District, Assam, on the Surm\u00e1 river, with considerable river-borne exports of rice, dried fish, bamboos, and mats; and imports of salt, tobacco, sugar, and piece-goods. Lat. 24\u00b0 33' 20\" N., long. 91\u00b0 16' 31\" E. In 1881, the exports by country boats were valued at \u00a318,000, and the imports at \u00a345,000.\n\nB.\n\nB\u00e1ba B\u00fadan, or Chandra Drona.\u2014Range of mountains in Kad\u00far District, Mysore State; between 13\u00b0 23' and 13\u00b0 35' N. lat., and 75\u00b0 37' and 75\u00b0 52' E. long. They form a horse-shoe, opening towards the north-west, about 6000 feet above sea level, the highest peak Mulaina-giri, being 6317 feet; other companion heights, B\u00e1ba B\u00fadan-giri (6214 feet) and Kalhatti-giri (6155 feet). The range runs out as an isolated spur of the Western Gh\u00e1ts; the northern arm, commencing with the Hebbe hill, stretches eastwards without interruption for about 15 miles, whence bending southwards, it presents an unbroken wall of more than 20 miles. The conspicuous conical peak on the outer verge of the eastern face is Devirammmangudda, on which a beacon is lighted, at the Dip\u00e1valli festival, which is visible for miles to all the surrounding country. A road passes along the eastern face from Chikmagal\u00far to Tarikere; midway is the settlement of Santaveri. The summits consist of grassy slopes, broken into ravines; and the sides are densely clothed with forests, including teak and sandal-wood. Here was the scene of the first cultivation of coffee in India, and plantations are now scattered over their valleys. The coffee berry is said to have been introduced from Mecca about two centuries ago by a Muhammadan saint, who has given his name to the mountains. His body lies buried in a cave on the southern slopes, which is now under the custody of a Musalm\u00e1n kaland\u00e1r, who resides at Attig\u00fandi, the\nprincipal village on the hills, and about a mile from the cave; but the spot is equally venerated by Hindus, who regard it as the throne of Datt\u00e1treya. A hot weather retreat for the European officials of the neighbouring Districts has been established at Kalhatti, in the north-east of the range, where there is also an experimental cinchona plantation. The rainfall is about 70 inches in the year. At the eastern base of the hills are two artificial lakes, which have been formed in early days by throwing embankments across narrow gorges. Their present utility for irrigation is small. Iron ore is largely obtained and smelted among the hills bordering the eastern slope of the range.\n\n**Bab\u00e1i.**\u2014Town in Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Central Provinces, situated 16 miles east of Hoshang\u00e1b\u00e1d town, on the high road to Jabalpur; Population (1881) 3818; namely, Hindus, 3169; Muhammadans, 510; Jains, 72; aboriginal tribes, 67.

Besides the railway, a road from Ujh\u00e1n\u00ed to Anupshahr (in Bulandshahr District) passes through the village.\n\n**Bab\u00e9ru.**\u2014Tahsil or Sub-division of B\u00e1nda District, North-Western Provinces (also known as Aug\u00e1si), stretching upward from the Jumna Jamun\u00e1), and consisting of a flat level plain, which is broken up into ravines in the neighbourhood of the Gar\u00e1ra Nala and the Jumna. Area, 362'4 square miles, of which 209 are cultivated; population (1881) 82,229. Land revenue, \u00a315,653; total revenue (including cesses), \u00a317,548; rental paid by cultivators, \u00a322,240; incidence of land revenue, 1s. 4\u00bdd. per acre of total area. The tahsil contained, in 1883, one criminal court, with three police stations; strength of regular police, 31 men; village watchmen (chaukid\u00e1rs), 172.\n\n**Bab\u00e9ru.**\u2014Town in B\u00e1nda District, North-Western Provinces, and head-quarters of Bab\u00e9ru tahsil, situated 24 miles east of B\u00e1nda town, with which it is connected by an unmetalled road, almost impassable in the rains. Tahsil\u00ed, police station, school, and sub-post-office. A town of but little importance; population (1881) 3580, principally Bais R\u00e1jputs.\n\n**B\u00e1bhar (Bh\u00e1bhar).**\u2014Petty State under the P\u00e1lanpur Agency, Guzer\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency; bounded north by Deodar, east and south by Terw\u00e1ra, and west by Suig\u00e1m and Th\u00e1rad. Area, about 130 square miles; population (1881) 7222, principally Kol\u00eds; contains 13 villages; revenue, \u00a31500. The State is held by Kol\u00ed Th\u00e1kurs, of mixed R\u00e1jput origin. In 1826, in consideration of the poverty of the petty chiefs in P\u00e1lanpur, the tribute was remitted altogether. The country is flat, with a great deal of jungle. The soil is sandy, pro-\nducing only one crop of the common grains yearly. British relations with the State date from 1820. Transit duties are levied.\n\n**B\u00e1bhar.**\u2014Chief town of the State of the same name, under the P\u00e1lanpur agency, in Guzer\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency; 55 miles west of P\u00e1lanpur. Lat. 24\u00b0 7' N., long. 71\u00b0 43' E.\n\n**Babhnip\u00e1ir.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Utraula tahsil, Gonda District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Mankapur and B\u00farhap\u00e1ra pargan\u00e1s; on the east and south by Basti District, in the North-West Provinces; and on the west by Naw\u00e1bganj pargan\u00e1. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Babhnip\u00e1ir, descended from the old Kalhans R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Khur\u00e1s\u00e1, is the head of the family, whose sway at one time extended from Gonda far into Gorakhpur District. On the downfall of the Khur\u00e1s\u00e1 dynasty, in accordance with a curse of extinction from a Br\u00e1hman whose daughter had been carried away by the R\u00e1j\u00e1, an exception was made in favour of the offspring of the youngest R\u00e1n\u00ed. A few months after her husband's death she bore a posthumous son, who possessed himself of a small chieftainship embracing Babhnip\u00e1ir, B\u00farhap\u00e1ra, Ras\u00falpur, Ghaus, etc. The Path\u00e1n chief of Utraula succeeded in wresting away a great portion of the estate, and Babhnip\u00e1ir pargan\u00e1 is all that now remains to his descendants. With the exception of a narrow belt of jungle along the bank of the Bis\u00fahi river in the north-east, the pargan\u00e1 is well populated, and under minute and careful tillage. The whole is a perfectly level, slightly raised plain, with no distinctive natural features beyond a number of small lakes, which collect the water during the rains. The soil is a good domat, or mixture of clay and sand. Irrigation is general. Area, 67 square miles, or 42,985 acres, of which 28,641, or 66\u00b75 per cent., are under cultivation. Autumn rice occupies about one-half of the cultivated area, the other crops being winter rice, wheat, gram, alsi, etc. The Government land revenue is \u00a34282, to be ultimately increased to \u00a34439 during the current thirty years settlement. Population (1881), Hindus, 33,538; Muhammadans, 2867: total, 36,405, viz. 18,687 males and 17,718 females; number of villages, 141. The most numerous castes are Br\u00e1hmans, 5622; Ch\u00e1m\u00e1rs, 4612; Ahfirs, 4233; and K\u00farm\u00eds, 2994. No manufactures or commerce. A road has been made through the west corner of the pargan\u00e1 to Naw\u00e1bganj, and it is also intersected by the new line of railway from Bahraich to Patn\u00e1. The other roads are merely rough cart-tracks which connect the villages with each other. The only place of religious importance is the shrine at Chhipia.\n\n**Babl\u00e1, or Dwark\u00e1.**\u2014River of Lower Bengal; rises in the Sant\u00e1 Pargan\u00e1s, and after watering the northern portion of B\u00edrbh\u00fam District passes through the south-west corner of Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d, flowing first in an easterly and then in a south-easterly direction. Again entering B\u00edrbh\u00fam, it finally falls into the Bh\u00e1g\u00edr\u00e1th\u00ed. During the latter part of\nits course it is navigable, and, being connected by numerous breakwaters and cross-channels with the Bh\u00e1g\u00edr\u00e1th\u00ed, it affords a convenient means of communication in the part of Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d District which it waters. With its confluents, it forms the chief drainage basin of the southern portion of that District.\n\nB\u00e1bra.\u2014Petty State in North K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency, consisting of 6 villages, with 6 independent tribute-payers. Estimated revenue in 1876, \u00a34000. The tribute due by this t\u00e1luk is paid by Amreli, in the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r\u2019s territory.

The pargan\u00e1 was held by the Bhars up till early in the 5th century, notwithstanding that they were subdued successively by a general of Sayyid S\u00e1l\u00e1r Mas\u00e1ud and by the Bais R\u00e1j\u00e1s. In that year, however, their power was completely broken by Sult\u00e1n Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm of Jaunpur. The zamind\u00e1ri of the pargan\u00e1 was granted to one of Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm\u2019s officers, K\u00e1z\u00ed Sult\u00e1n, but his descendants have been gradually deprived of the greater portion of their estates by the K\u00farm\u00eds and Bais; only 6 villages now remain to them, and these are mortgaged. The pargan\u00e1 is very fertile, owing to irrigation from numerous tanks, and it abounds in groves of mango and mahu\u00e1 trees. Soil chiefly loam and clay. The principal markets are at Girdh\u00e1raganj, Kundunaganj, and Hasanganj. Two rivers, the S\u00e1i and Naiya, intersect the pargan\u00e1. Area, 94\u00bd square miles, or 60,395 acres; cultivated area,\n49 square miles. Government land revenue, \u00a36734, at the rate of 2s. 2\u00bdd. per acre. The 58 villages of which the pargan\u00e1 is composed are held under the following tenures:\u2014T\u00e1lukd\u00e1ri, 45; zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri, 2; and pattid\u00e1ri, 11. Population (1881) 44,697\u2014namely, 21,908 males and 22,789 females: number of villages, 58; average density of population, 476 per square mile. Salt was formerly manufactured, but this industry is not now carried on, although saltpetre, to the extent of about 38 tons per annum, is still made in 11 villages. Six villages have bi-weekly markets. Large cattle market at Girdh\u00e1ranganj, attended by dealers from trans-Gogra Districts and from Tirh\u00fat.\n\nBachhr\u00e1w\u00e1n.\u2014Town in Digbij\u00e1iganj tahsil, R\u00e1i Bareli District, Oudh, and head-quarters of Bachhr\u00e1wan pargan\u00e1, on the road from R\u00e1i Bareli to Lucknow.

The \u2018Bachiredd\u00edp\u00e1lem Family\u2019 dates from 1700, and owes its fortunes and present position to the intelligent public spirit of its members, recognised from time to time by grants of land. The important irrigation channel from the Penner (Ponnaiy\u00e1r) to the Southern Delta, now abandoned, and the temple at Bachiredd\u00edp\u00e1lem, are among the public works constructed at their own expense by members of the family.\n\nBackergunge.\u2014District of Bengal.\u2014See Bakarganj.\n\nBad\u00e1gara (Vadaka-Rara, \u2018The North Bank;\u2019 Vatakara Wuddakurray of the Indian Atlas, usually known as Bad\u00e1gara).\u2014Town in Malab\u00e1r District, Madras Presidency.

Imports in 1880\u201381, \u00a356,701; exports, \u00a384,405. The fort belonged originally to the Kolattiri (Chirakkal) R\u00e1j\u00e1s, from whom it was obtained (probably in gift) by the K\u00e1dattan\u00e1d family in 1564. It then passed into the possession of Tip\u00fa Sult\u00e1n, who made it the chief export custom station in his dominions. In 1790 the fort was taken from Tip\u00fa, and having been restored to the K\u00e1dattan\u00e1d R\u00e1j\u00e1, has now been converted\ninto a rest-house for pilgrims. Bad\u00e1gara is a busy town, the headquarters of the t\u00e1luk, with sub-magistrate\u2019s and judge\u2019s courts, custom-house, jail, post-office, and travellers\u2019 bungalow.\n\nBadaksh\u00e1n.\u2014Mountainous tract of country in Afgh\u00e1n T\u00fark\u00edst\u00e1n, containing the valley of the Kokcha with its feeders, and tributary to the Am\u00edr of Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n; lying beyond the Hindu Kush range, and therefore outside the scope of this work; bounded on the north by Kul\u00e1b and Darw\u00e1z, on the east by the P\u00e1m\u00edr table-land, on the south by the Hindu Kush, and on the west by Kund\u00faz and Katagh\u00e1n.

Chief agricultural products\u2014wheat, rice, cotton, poppy, oil-seeds, mulberries (the chief article of food in these parts), and many other fruits. From their features the Badaksh\u00eds would appear to be akin to the inhabitants of K\u00e1sar\u00edst\u00e1n, Chitr\u00e1l, Wakh\u00e1n, Shagn\u00e1n, and Rosh\u00e1n. They are believed to be a pure Aryan race, intermediate between the Iranians and Hindus, and of the same stock as the highland T\u00e1jiks, whom Chevalier de Ujfalvy groups under the collective name of Galchas. A Galcha skull, which found its way to Paris, was examined by P. Topinard, who pronounced it to be identical with those of the early Keltic Aryans.\n\nB\u00e1d\u00e1mi.\u2014Sub-division of Kal\u00e1dgi District, Bombay Presidency.

The Jain cave is only 31 feet across by about 19 feet deep. These caves mark the period when Hinduism was re-asserting itself previous to its final triumph over Buddhism in the next century or two. The N\u00e1rasingha avat\u00e1r, Vishnu seated on the five-headed serpent Ananka, and a variety of sculptures, still survive. In one cave temple the front pillars have three brackets of a wooden-like design, ornamented by male or female figures and dwarfs, of considerable beauty of execution. Some of the pillars are more architectural in their forms, and in the best style of Hindu art.\n\nBadarganj.\u2014Trading village and produce dep\u00f4t, in Rangpur District, Bengal.

It is also called Badnera Bib\u00ed, from having formed part of the dowry of an Ahmadnagar princess. The old town and earthen fort on the north of the railway were the residence of the Mughal officials. The exactions of successive rulers depopulated Badnera, and it was plundered in 1822 by R\u00e1j\u00e1 R\u00e1m S\u00fabah, who partly demolished the fort and town walls. A cotton mill has been recently erected here, and there is a large steam cotton ginning and press factory. Rich p\u00e1n gardens and plantain grounds lie round the old town.

Lat. 24\u00b0 17' 30\" N., long. 88\u00b0 17' E. Ruins extending several miles from the river show that an ancient city with a palace or fort once stood here. Stones and pillars engraved with P\u00e1li characters, gold coins, and much broken pottery, have been found; but there is no evidence to throw light upon the history of the place. The P\u00e1li inscriptions seem to point to the Buddhist period. The old Hindu name of Badrih\u00e1t was changed by the conquering Muhammadans to Ghi\u00e1s\u00e1b\u00e1d, in honour of Ghi\u00e1s-ud-d\u00edn, one of the Path\u00e1n kings of Gaur, who is said to be buried here.\n\nBadrin\u00e1th.\u2014Peak of the main Him\u00e1layan range in Garhw\u00e1l District, North-Western Provinces, reaching to a height of 23,210 feet above the sea. From the glaciers on its sides, the Alaknanda river and many of its tributaries take their rise. On one of its shoulders, at an elevation of 10,400 feet, and 56 miles north-east of Sr\u00ednagar, stands a shrine of Vishnu, which also bears the name of Badrin\u00e1th (lat. 30\u00b0 44' 15\" N., long. 79\u00b0 30' 40\" E.). The existing temple, more noteworthy for its religious importance than for any architectural pretensions, is said to have been erected some 800 years ago by Sankara Sw\u00e1m\u00ed, who brought up the figure of the deity from the bottom of the river after diving ten times. It consists of a conical building, surmounted by a small copper-covered cupola, terminating in a golden ball and spire. Several previous\ntemples, according to tradition, were swept away by avalanches, and the present erection has been severely shattered by an earthquake. Below the shrine a sacred tank stands on the hill-side, supplied from a thermal spring by means of a spout in the shape of a dragon\u2019s head. Pilgrims of both sexes bathe in the holy pool. The god is daily provided with a dinner, and his comfort is carefully ensured in many other ways. The vessels on which he is served are of gold and silver, and a large staff of servants attend to his various wants. The chief priest, known as the R\u00e1wal, is always a Br\u00e1hman of the Namb\u00fari caste, from K\u00edrat Malw\u00e1r in the Deccan (Dakshin). The priests officiate at Badrin\u00e1th from May to October, and then bury the treasure and retire to JOSHIMATH for the winter. Four other temples are dependent upon Badrin\u00e1th. Besides the offerings of pilgrims, the revenue of a large number of villages in Kum\u00e1un and Garhw\u00e1l is appropriated to the use of the temple; annual value, \u00a3394. Immense numbers of pilgrims annually pay a visit to Badrin\u00e1th, and in some years as many as 50,000 persons have been known to attend the great festival.\n\nBadrpur, or Badarpur.\u2014Village in Sylhet District, Assam; situated six miles above the bifurcation of the Bar\u00e1k into the Surm\u00e1 and Kusiy\u00e1ra rivers, close to the boundary of Cachar District.

When the Burmese invaded Cachar in 1826, the British troops met and defeated them at this spot. There is a picturesque old fort on a rock overlooking the river. It is rectangular, built of stone and lime, with high walls and bastions, loopholed for musketry, and not intended for artillery. There is now no building inside the walls.\n\nBadsh\u00e1hpur.\u2014Town in Jaunpur District, North-Western Provinces. Population (1881) 6423, namely, Hindus 4952, and Muhammadans 1471.

It rises in the Ballabhgarh hills in Delhi District, and although the bed is nearly dry during the greater part of the year, it becomes an impassable torrent for a few hours after heavy rains in the hills. The stream brings down the drainage of a part of Ballabhgarh tahsil through a gorge in the hills near the village of B\u00e1dsh\u00e1hpur, from which it takes its name. It formerly flowed to the south through the Bh\u00fansi valley into the Ch\u00e1ndeni jhil, but upwards of a century and a half ago it was diverted into its present western course by the construction of a dam by a local landholder, Bah\u00e1dur Singh of Ghasera, and its waters now go to swell the Najafgarh jhil, though after heavy floods, as in 1875, part of the stream still finds its way south by the old channel.\n\nB\u00e1duria.\u2014Town in the District of the 24 Parg\u00e1n\u00e1s, situated on the\nright bank of the Jamuna river.

Area about 70 square miles. Population estimated at 3500. The rich black soil of the southern portion of this tract is capable of producing rich crops of wheat and other grains, also opium; but the northern portion is covered with jungle. The Vindhya range forms the northern boundary, and the only hill lying within the pargan\u00e1 is Tumbai M\u00e1t\u00e1, having an elevation of about 2500 feet above the level of the sea. A table-land of 2 miles in length and 1 mile in breadth stretches along its top, with a small temple on its western side. The inhabitants are mostly immigrants from the adjacent districts in Holkar\u2019s territory. No towns of importance as regards commerce and fairs, or of any special interest exist. A fair-weather cart road runs through the pargan\u00e1 for a distance of 16 miles, and the Holkar State Railway passes to the eastward of it. Revenue (1878), \u00a3541.

These vih\u00e1ras, only a little less interesting than those of Ajanta, date from 500 to 700 A.D. They are remarkable for their rock-hewn pillars, and were at one time adorned with frescoes, in brilliant colours and of great beauty. First described, about 1820, by Lieutenant Dangerfield in Transactions of the Bombay Literary Society, vol. ii.; and subsequently, in 1854, by Dr. E. Impey (see Journal Bombay Branch of Royal Asiatic Society, vol. v.

Classified according to religion, the population consists of Hindus, 20,351, and Muhammadans, 282. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 is a Puar R\u00e1jput. The title of the ruling family was previously R\u00e1n\u00e1; but the predecessor of the present chief acquired for himself and successors the title of R\u00e1j\u00e1 for good services to Government. He holds the territory under a sanad dated 1815, and pays a tribute of \u00a3360 in commutation for beg\u00e1rs or forced labour. He has a military force of 50 infantry and 1 field gun. He is also bound to keep the roads in his territories in order. Sentences of death passed by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 require the confirmation of the Superintendent of the Hill States and of the Commissioner of the Division; all other punishments are awarded by the R\u00e1j\u00e1 on his own authority. The revenue of the State is returned at about \u00a36000. The capital of the State is Arki, a village about 20 miles distant from Simla. The well-built residence of the R\u00e1j\u00e1 is situated above the town, and has an imposing appearance. The R\u00e1j\u00e1 has built and furnished an excellent rest-house for the accommodation of his European guests and for travellers. B\u00e1ghal is, for the hills, a populous and flourishing little State. Agriculture is carried on by Kanets and Br\u00e1hmans (principally Gaurs and Sara\u00fats). The Gurkh\u00e1s during their short and oppressive rule in the hills between the Jumna and the Sutlej made Arki their capital.\n\nBagh\u00e1r (Baghi\u00e1r).\u2014A western offshoot of the Indus, diverging from it about lat. $24^\\circ 40' N.$, long. $68^\\circ E.$, to the south of Tatta, in Kar\u00e1ch\u00ed (Kurrachee) District, Sind, Bombay Presidency.

Owing to a sandbank having been thrown up where it diverges from the Indus, the Bagh\u00e1r in 1840 became almost dry. It is at the present day the chief watercourse connecting the Indus with the sea, through the Jhirak (Jerruck) Deputy-Collectorate.\n\nBagh\u00e1t.\u2014Protected Hill State, Punjab, in the vicinity of Simla, and under the political superintendence of the Commissioner of the Amb\u00e1l\u00e1 (Umballa) Division.

The R\u00e1n\u00e1, Dhulip Singh, is a R\u00e1jput, and was born about 1859. His military and police force amount to 35 men. The tribute payable is \u00a3200 per annum, but \u00a3139 is remitted on account of the land occupied by the Kasauli and Solon cantonments (between K\u00e1lk\u00e1 and Simla), and by the rifle-range at the latter station. The State is held on the same conditions as Baghal. The annual revenue of the Chief is estimated at \u00a3800.\n\nB\u00e1ghbanpur.\u2014Village in Lahore tahs\u00edl, Lahore District, Punjab; 5 miles east of Lahore. Population (1881) 4269.

The Agency for this tract was established in March 1871. Lies between 22\u00b0 40' and 25\u00b0 10' N. lat., and between 80\u00b0 25' and 82\u00b0 45' E. long.; bounded on the north by Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d and Mirz\u00e1pur Districts of the North-Western Provinces, on the east by the tributary States of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gpur, on the south by Bil\u00e1spur and M\u00e1ndla Districts of the Central Provinces, and on the west by Jabalpur (Jubbulpore) District and the States of Bundelkhand. Until 1871, Baghelkhand was under the Bundelkhand Agency, and it is geographically as well as historically connected with that province, under which head a general description of the country will be found. Area, according to the Census of 1881, 11,323 square miles; population (1881) 1,512,595, distributed in 4 towns and 5832 villages; number of occupied houses, 295,924; density, 133\u00b75 persons per square mile. The States comprising the Baghelkhand Agency are Rew\u00e1, Nagode, Maihar, Sohawal, Kothi, and Sidpura Jagir (all of which see separately). Rew\u00e1 is the only State with a treaty, the others are held under sanads or rescripts of the British Government. Transit duties have been abolished by all the chiefs of Baghelkhand. According to Wilson, in his Glossary of Indian Terms, the Baghel\u00e1s, who give their name to this tract of country, are a branch of the Sisodhiya R\u00e1jputs who migrated eastwards, and who\nonce ruled in Gujar\u00e1t (Guzer\u00e1t). Akbar gave the tribe much influence.\n\n**B\u00e1gherh\u00e1t (Bagirh\u00e1t).**\u2014Sub-division of Khuln\u00e1 District, *Bengal*, lying between $21^\\circ 44'$ and $22^\\circ 59' 15''$ N. lat., and between $89^\\circ 34'$ and $90^\\circ 0' 15''$ E. long.

Lat. $22^\\circ 40' 5''$ N., long. $89^\\circ 49' 50''$ E. A little to the west of this village are several interesting ruins of the famous buildings of Kh\u00e1n Jah\u00e1n. The chief of these is the Sh\u00e1t-gumbuz, a sixty-domed mosque, 3 miles west of B\u00e1gherh\u00e1t,\u2014a splendid building, which was reported in 1871 to be in fair repair, although the roof was covered with jungle. From the Bhairab river at B\u00e1gherh\u00e1t to the Sh\u00e1t-gumbuz there is a brick road, also the work of Kh\u00e1n Jah\u00e1n, and still in good order, although it is said not to have been repaired since it was made 400 years ago. About a mile and a half from B\u00e1gherh\u00e1t along this road a track strikes off to a mound, on which is situated, within a double enclosure, Kh\u00e1n Jah\u00e1n\u2019s tomb, covered by a dome 47 feet in height. Here an annual fair is held in March\u2013April at full moon. The tomb is also visited by pilgrims throughout the year. Kh\u00e1n Jah\u00e1n, who was one of the earliest reclaimers of the Sundarbans, died in 1459. The village has considerably increased in size and importance of late years, and contains, besides the usual Sub-divisional buildings, a police station and dispensary. The inhabitants, who are mostly Muhammadans, are described as turbulent and lawless, and excessively fond of litigation.\n\n**B\u00e1ghj\u00e1l\u00e1 (South Dum-Dum).**\u2014Town in the District of the Twenty-four Pargan\u00e1s, Bengal.

Rises in Nep\u00e1l, near K\u00e1thm\u00e1ndu, and on entering British territory forms the boundary between the Districts of Muzaffarpur and Champ\u00e1ran, until near Narw\u00e1 it takes a south-westerly direction through Darbhanga District, and ultimately joins the B\u00fari Gandak above Rusera. Being, for a considerable portion of its course, a hill stream, and flowing on a ridge, it rises very quickly after heavy rain, and sometimes causes much damage by overflowing its banks; the current is very swift, running 7 miles an hour in the upper reaches during heavy freshes. Near Darbhanga, the B\u00e1ghmat\u00ed and its larger tributaries flow through very flat country, and fail to keep distinct courses. At Hai\u00e1gh\u00e1t the B\u00e1ghmat\u00ed bifurcates, one branch, called the Karai, turning to the east, and ultimately falling into the Tiljuga at T\u00edlkeswar, while the parent stream turns more to the south, and finally joins the Gandak. A portion of the river has been embanked since 1810 by the managers of the Kantai indigo factory. For some distance north of the Nep\u00e1l frontier, the river is navigable for boats of about 9 tons burthen; between the frontier and Gaigh\u00e1t\u00ed, where the stream is crossed by the Muzaffarpur-Darbhanga road, for boats of 18 tons; and below Gaigh\u00e1t\u00ed for boats of 75 tons burthen.

A former bed of the river, known as the Old B\u00e1ghmat\u00ed, extends from M\u00e1l\u00e1\u00ed, on the frontier, to Bel\u00e1npur gh\u00e1t, $3\\frac{1}{2}$ miles north-west of Kaly\u00e1 gh\u00e1t, where it joins the present stream. It carries a good deal of water in the rains, but is only two feet deep in the cold weather. Several factories are situated on its east bank, and draw their water from it.\n\nB\u00e1ghmat\u00ed, Little.\u2014River in Muzaffarpur District, Bengal; a tributary of the B\u00e1ghmat\u00ed, which it joins at Hai\u00e1gh\u00e1t, about 8 miles south of Darbhanga. Navigable in the rains from Hai\u00e1gh\u00e1t as far as Darbhanga, by boats of about 75 tons, and by boats of about 18 tons up to P\u00e1li, 20 miles farther north. The Little B\u00e1ghmat\u00ed, before falling into the B\u00e1ghmat\u00ed, is itself fed by numerous streams, the chief being the Kaml\u00e1, the Dhaus, and the Jh\u00edm.\n\nB\u00e1ghm\u00fand\u00ed.\u2014Plateau and hill range in M\u00e1nbh\u00fam District, Bengal; highest peak, Gang\u00e1b\u00e1ri or Gajboru (lat. $23\u00b0\\ 12'$ N., long. $86\u00b0\\ 5'30''$ E.), a bold, cliff-like hill, with rocky and forest-clad sides, accessible only on foot, except from the plateau.

Bounded on the north-east by the British District of Sirsa (Bhatti\u00e1na), on the east and south by the R\u00e1jput\u00e1na States of B\u00edkaner (Bickaneer) and Jaisalmer (Jeysulmere), on the south-west by Sind, on the north-west by the Indus and the Sutlej (Satlaj) rivers. Area, 15,000 square miles, of which 9880 miles are desert. Along the river lies a strip of alluvial soil from 8 to 14 miles in width, which alone is cultivated. This tract scored throughout with deep depressions left by changes in the course of the rivers; and these have been as far as possible utilized as canal beds. In the centre of the State is a belt of higher land, about 10 miles wide; and on the east commences the great sandy desert which stretches into R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. The surface consists of a succession of undulating sand ridges, from 100 to 500 feet high. The Census of\n1881 returned the population of the State at 573,494, classified as follows:\u2014Muhammadans, 480,274; Hindus, 91,272; Sikhs, 1678; Jains, 254; Parsis, 3; and Christians, 13. The number of villages and towns was returned at 922; occupied houses, 88,650; unoccupied houses, 44,210; number of resident families, 122,623. Males 314,395, and females 259,099. Average density, 38 persons per square mile.\n\nThe principal towns in the State, with their populations in 1881, are as follow:\u2014Bahawalpur, the capital, population 13,635; Ahmadpur, 9853; Khanpur, 7189; Uchh, 5767; Garhi Mukhtiyar Khan, 5001; Khairpur, 4543; Ahmadpur (2), 4235; and Minchinabad, 1858. The language varies from Sindhi in the south to Punjabi in the north, the ordinary dialect being a mixture of the two, called Multani.\n\nAt Bahawalpur town there is a silk manufactory, which is said to have been introduced many years ago from Benares. The principal articles of production in the State are lungis, sufi, silk goods, indigo, cotton, and cereals. Considerable extensions have been lately made in the area irrigated by State canals. New lines of canal have been opened out, and a steam dredger imported from England is used for removing silt and keeping open the channel of communication between the canal heads and the river Indus. As the State of Bahawalpur depends upon inundation canals for the greater portion of its cultivation, these improvements have been of great value, especially the introduction of irrigation into the north-eastern Districts of the State, where it had not existed since the failure of a great natural channel which winds through that region. This channel has been filled with water for a distance of 77 miles, and a new canal, 113 miles in length, with two large branches, has been excavated parallel to the Sutlej about 15 miles inland. In consequence of these and other works, the State revenues have of late nearly doubled. Courts of justice have been established under the general control of a chief court, presided over by three native judges; a system of public instruction, comprising primary, middle, and superior education, has been set on foot. A central jail has been built, where for the first time in India a trial has been given to the separate system of imprisonment, side by side with the partially separate and associated system, with a result exceedingly favourable to the first. Three new towns have been lately founded. A stud farm for improving the breed of horses and cattle has been started with every prospect of success; and recently the extensive jungles have been placed under the supervision of a trained forest conservator with a view to providing a supply of fuel. The Indus Valley State Railway, from Multan to Kotri on the Indus in Sind, runs through a large portion of the territory crossing the Sutlej river by a magnificent bridge at Bahawalpur town. The gross revenue of the State in 1881-82 was estimated at about \u00a3160,000.\nHistory and Administration.\u2014The ancestors of the ruling family of Bah\u00e1walpur originally came from Sind, and assumed independence during the dismemberment of the Dur\u00e1ni Empire, which followed the expulsion of Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1 from K\u00e1b\u00fal. On the rise of Ranj\u00edt Singh, the Naw\u00e1b, Bah\u00e1wal Kh\u00e1n, made several applications to the British Government for an engagement of protection. These however were declined, although the treaties of Lahore in 1809, whereby Ranj\u00edt Singh was confined to the right bank of the Sutlej, in reality effected this object. The first treaty with Bah\u00e1walpur was in 1833, which was negotiated at the same time as the treaty with Ranj\u00edt Singh for regulating traffic on the Indus. It secured the independence of the Naw\u00e1b within his own territories, and opened up the traffic on the Indus and Sutlej. The political relations of Bah\u00e1walpur with the paramount power, as at present existing, are regulated by the treaty of October 1838, when arrangements were being made for the restoration of Sh\u00e1h Shuj\u00e1 to the K\u00e1b\u00fal throne. The main provisions are as follow. The British Government is bound to protect the principality and territory of Bah\u00e1walpur; the Naw\u00e1b is bound to act in subordinate co-operation with the British Government, and to acknowledge its supremacy. He may not enter into negotiations with any chief or State without the knowledge and sanction of the British Government; he is debarred from aggression; and disputes are to be submitted to British arbitration and award. The Naw\u00e1b and his heirs and successors are to be absolute rulers of the country, and British jurisdiction is not to be introduced.\n\nDuring the first Afgh\u00e1n war, the Naw\u00e1b rendered assistance both in facilitating the passage of troops and in furnishing supplies; and in 1847\u201348 he co-operated actively with Sir Herbert Edwardes in the expedition against Mult\u00e1n. For these services he was rewarded by the grant of the districts of Sabzalkot and Bhoung, together with a life pension of a l\u00e1kh of rupees (say \u00a310,000 per annum). On his death a succession dispute arose. He was succeeded by his third son, whom he had nominated for the throne in supersession of his eldest son. He was, however, deposed by his elder brother, and obtained asylum in British territory, with a pension from the Bah\u00e1walpur revenues. But on his breaking his promise to abandon his claims, he was confined in the Lahore fort, where he died in 1862. In 1863 and 1866 insurrections broke out against the Naw\u00e1b, caused by his cruelty and misgovernment. The Naw\u00e1b successfully crushed the rebellions; but in March 1866 he died suddenly, not without suspicion of having been poisoned, and was succeeded by his son, the present Naw\u00e1b, S\u00e1d\u00edk Muhammad Kh\u00e1n, then a minor of four years of age. After several endeavours to arrange for the administration of the country without active interference on the part of Government, it was found necessary, on account of disorganization and disaffection, to place the principality\nin British hands during the minority of the young chief. The Naw\u00e1b attained his majority in 1879, and was invested with full powers of governorship, which he has conducted with the advice and assistance of a council of six members, whose appointment or dismissal is subject to the sanction of the British Government. During the Afgh\u00e1n campaigns (1878\u201380) the Naw\u00e1b placed the entire resources of his State at the disposal of the British Government, and a contingent of his troops was employed in keeping open communications, and in guarding the Dera Gh\u00e1zi Kh\u00e1n frontier.\n\nIn precedence, the Naw\u00e1b of Bah\u00e1walpur ranks third on the list of Punjab chiefs, coming next to the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Pati\u00e1la. He is entitled to a salute of 17 guns. He pays no tribute, and enjoys a gross revenue estimated at 16 l\u00e1khs of rupees, or say \u00a3160,000. The military force of the State consists of 12 guns, 99 artillerymen, 300 cavalry, and 2493 infantry and police.\n\nBah\u00e1walpur.\u2014Capital of Bah\u00e1walpur State, Punjab; situated about two miles from the Sutlej river, on the Indus Valley State Railway, 63 miles from Mult\u00e1n,* and 219 from Sakkar (Sukkur). Lat. 29\u00b0 24' N., long. 71\u00b0 47' E.; height 375 feet above sea level. Population (1881) 13,635; namely, Muhammadans, 7459; Hindus, 6082; Sikhs, 43; Jains, 48; 'others,' 3; number of occupied houses, 2906. The city is surrounded by a mud wall four miles in circuit. The palace of the Naw\u00e1b is a vast square pile, with towers at each corner. The reception hall in the centre is 60 feet long and 56 feet high, the vestibule to it being 120 feet high. The palace contains underground apartments where the thermometer remains at about 70\u00b0 F., while it rises to 100\u00b0 and even 110\u00b0 in the upper rooms. From the roof of the palace an extensive view is gained over the vast desert of Bikaner, which stretches away waterless for 100 miles. Five miles from Bah\u00e1walpur, the Indus Valley Railway crosses the Sutlej by a magnificent iron girder bridge, 4258 feet in length, consisting of sixteen spans, each 250 feet long. It is called the 'Empress' bridge, and was opened in June 1878.

Area of town site, 938 acres.\n\n**B\u00e1hli.**\u2014Mountain range in the Native State of Bashahr, Punjab, running in a north-west direction from the Him\u00e1layan outliers to the banks of the Sutlej (Satlaj); crowned by a rectangular fort. The river Naugarrikhola flows at its foot. Lat. (of chief peak) 31\u00b0 22' N., long. 77\u00b0 42' E. The village of B\u00e1hli, with a travellers\u2019 bungalow, is situated on the upper or new line of the Hindust\u00e1n and Tibet road, distant from Rampur, and from Ser\u00e1han (the summer quarters of the R\u00e1j\u00e1s of Rampur and Bashahr) each one stage.\n\n**Bahlolpur.**\u2014Town in Ludhi\u00e1na District, Punjab.\u2014See BHILOLPUR.\n\n**Bahraich.**\u2014District of Oudh, in the Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d (Fyz\u00e1b\u00e1d) Division, under the jurisdiction of the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces, lying between lat. 27\u00b0 2' and 28\u00b0 12' N., and between long. 81\u00b0 2' and 82\u00b0 15' E. Area, 2740 square miles; population (1881) 878,048. The shape of the District is that of an isosceles triangle, with its base running south-west and its apex to the north-east. Bahraich forms the most northerly District of the Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d Division or Commissionership, and is bounded on the north by the independent State of Nep\u00e1l; on the east by the District of Gonda; on the south by Gonda and Bara Banki; and on the west by Sit\u00e1pur and Kheri, the Kaur\u00ed\u00e1la or Gogra river forming the boundary. The administrative head-quarters of the District are at Bahraich, which is also the chief town of the District.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014The physical features of the District of Bahraich are well marked by the course of the Gogra and R\u00e1pti rivers. A belt of comparatively high land, raised about 40 feet above the level of the surrounding country, of a uniform breadth of 12 or 13 miles, and a total area of about 670 square miles, runs through the District in a south-easterly direction, forming the watershed between the two rivers. The great plain of the Gogra stretches away from the southern edge of this strip of upland down to the river itself, which flows along the western boundary of the District, at a distance from the plateau varying from 10 miles in the north to 35 miles in the south. Tradition asserts, and the whole appearance of the country supports the theory, that in past ages the Gogra flowed immediately under this high bank, and gradually receded westwards until it reached its present course. The numerous channels with which this alluvial plain is scored in all parts, testify to the fact that it has been subjected at times to fluvial action. These channels, of which some now form mere drainage streams, and others are dry during the greater\npart of the year, have a general direction parallel to the main river. The Gogra, or Kauri\u00e1la, as it is called in its upper reaches, enters Bahraich District from the Nep\u00e1l tar\u00e1\u00ed on its extreme north-east corner, at the point where the Mohan joins it from the west. After a course of a few miles it is joined by the Girwa, a little below Bharth\u00e1pur. Its only other tributary of importance on the Bahraich side is the Sarju, which also enters from Nep\u00e1l 22 miles east of the Kauri\u00e1la, and separated from it by a high tract of forest land. It flows south by an exceedingly tortuous course of 70 miles, and falls into the Kauri\u00e1la at Kat\u00e1i gh\u00e1t. In the early part of the century, the Sarju, instead of joining the Kauri\u00e1la at Bahraich, flowed on into Gonda District. The stream was turned into its present channel by a European timber merchant, with a view to securing a more expeditious route for floating down his logs. Below the confluence of the Kauri\u00e1la and Sarju the united stream is called the Gogra. Its volume is further increased by tributaries from Kheri District, but it receives no more affluents on the Bahraich bank, and it leaves the District in its extreme south-west corner. The R\u00e1pti, whose valley lies on the northern side of the plateau described above, enters British territory from Nep\u00e1l about midway on the frontier line, at Sid\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1 gh\u00e1t; it thence follows a winding course of 81 miles in a south-easterly direction, till it passes into Gonda District. The principal tributary of the R\u00e1pti is the Bhakla, a stream rising in the Nep\u00e1l tar\u00e1\u00ed, which flows immediately under the north bank of the plateau, and joins the R\u00e1pti under the name of the Singhia just above Sahet Mahet. All these rivers are navigable throughout the year\u2014the Gogra and R\u00e1pti for boats of 20 tons burthen, the others for smaller craft. The river traffic, mainly confined to the export of grain, is very extensive. Valuable \u2018reserved\u2019 timber forests exist in the north of the District, comprising an area in 1880\u201381 of 257 square miles.\n\nHistory.\u2014According to Hindu tradition, the District derives its name from Brahma, the Creator, who chose this country as his especial kingdom, and called together a company of holy Rishis to establish his worship in its forests. Hence Bahraich, or Brahm-\u00e1\u00edch, \u2018the assembly of Brahma.\u2019 In legendary times it formed a division of the kingdom of Adjodhya, known as Uttar-Kosala, and was governed by L\u00e1va, the son of R\u00e1m\u00e1, whose capital was at Sravasti, now known as Sahet Mahet (q.v.), the ruins of which are situated in the east of this District, on the south bank of the R\u00e1pti. Uttar-Kosala also claims to be the cradle of Buddhism. Sakya Buddha, the founder of the faith, was born within its borders at Kapil\u00e1nagara (now Nagar, near Basti) about 623 B.C., and passed nineteen years of his life at Sravasti. The king and his minister became converts to the new faith, and Br\u00e1hmanism was temporarily overthrown. The Chinese traveller, Fa Hian, who\nvisited the country about 410 A.D., at a time when Buddhism had lost its supremacy, describes the city as in a decayed state, containing only 200 families, but abounding in remains of monastic buildings, memorial pillars, shrines, etc., which have been identified and described by General Cunningham in his *Ancient Geography* (vol. i. pp. 408, 409). Other Buddhist remains have been identified at Tandwa, a village about 9 miles west of Sahet Mahet, where the Hindus still worship a statue of Mah\u00e1 M\u00e1i, Buddha\u2019s mother, under the name of S\u00edt\u00e1 M\u00e1i. Buddhist coins have also been found on the banks of the Gogra. In common with the rest of Eastern Oudh, the District is said to have been at one time under the Bhars, and the name of Bahraich itself is derived by some etymologists from this race. No distinctive memorials of this people are now found in the District. The descendants of the Bhars who escaped the sword of the R\u00e1jputs on their conquest of the country, must either have emigrated or been absorbed in the rest of the population. The Muhammadans first made their appearance in Bahraich in 1033 A.D., under Sayyid S\u00e1l\u00e1r Mas\u00e1\u00fad, who overran the country, but after a series of victories was defeated at Bahraich town by the confederate R\u00e1jput princes, and slain with almost his entire army. A famous shrine, frequented by Muhammadans from all parts of India, covers his remains. Various expeditions followed, but it was not till the middle of the 13th century that a regular Muhammadan government was established in the trans-Gogra region. One of the earliest governors was Nas\u00edr-ud-d\u00edn Mahm\u00fad, son of Sult\u00e1n Shams-ud-d\u00edn Altamsh, who vigorously ruled the District until he succeeded to the throne of Delhi in 1246. For the best part of a century after Nas\u00edr-ud-d\u00edn\u2019s rule, the records of Bahraich contain nothing noteworthy. The Ans\u00e1r\u00eds, the descendants of the earlier Musalm\u00e1n settlers and invaders, were gradually extending their hold over the south of the country in His\u00e1mpur; but the older races were not yet crushed, for so late as the end of the 14th century, Bhar chieftains held sway both in this *pargan\u00e1* and in Fakhrpur. In 1340, the first of the series of land grants was made, from which sprang most of the late *t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r\u00ed* families in the District. In that year, a large tract of country in Jarauli *pargan\u00e1* was awarded by the Emperor Gh\u00eda\u015b-ud-d\u00edn to a Persian Sayyid family, who entered into possession after expelling by force the Bhar R\u00e1j\u00e1, who had previously held the villages. In the next reign \u2014 that of Firoz Sh\u00e1h Tughlak\u2014a large tract in the east of the District, which was overrun by banditti, was made over to a young Janw\u00e1r officer of the Emperor, named Bariah S\u00e1h, as a reward for ridding the country of the gang and restoring order. Bariah S\u00e1h took up his residence at Ikauna, and became the founder of the great family which in the course of 17 generations has provided landlords for many estates.\nin Bahraich and Gonda Districts. The Raikw\u00e1rs are the descendants of two brothers, S\u00farajbans R\u00e1jputs, who migrated from Raika in Kashmir. The son of one of the brothers obtained service with the Bhar chief of Bamnauti. He served his master so well, and increased the value of his estate to such an extent, that the R\u00e1j\u00e1 refused to acknowledge the authority of the Delhi Government, and rebelled. The young Raikw\u00e1r took advantage of the opportunity, slew his master, and possessed himself of the estate. This was about 1450 A.D., and from that day the Raikw\u00e1rs have remained masters of the western portion of the District. At the end of the 15th century the District was occupied much as follows:\u2014The Ans\u00e1ris in the south, the Janw\u00e1rs in the east, and the Raikw\u00e1rs in the west, held the southern portion of the District; while the northern tracts were practically independent under the sway of hill chieftains. During the governorship of K\u00e1l\u00e1 Pah\u00e1r, the nephew of the Emperor Bahlol Lodh\u00ed, these turbulent chiefs were brought into some sort of subjection, being made, nominally at least, to acknowledge the imperial sway, and pay revenue.\n\nIn the reign of Akbar (1556\u20131605), Bahraich District, together with a portion of the Nep\u00e1l tar\u00e1\u00ed, was formed into an administrative division, called Sark\u00e1r Bahraich. It comprised 11 pargan\u00e1s or Fiscal Divisions, with a cultivated area of 1,664,714 bigh\u00e1s or 867 square miles, and paid a total revenue of 24,079,624 d\u00e1ms, which, at the rate of 40 per rupee, is equal to Rs. 601,990 (say \u00a360,199). The Raikw\u00e1rs and Janw\u00e1rs continued to extend their possessions to the west and east, principally by further grants, but partly by conquest. A grant of a few small villages in the northern pargan\u00e1s to a Muhammadan officer of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, became the nucleus of the great estate of N\u00e1np\u00e1r\u00e1, now one of the finest in Oudh. The separation of Oudh from the Delhi Empire, and the independent rule of the Naw\u00e1b Waz\u00edrs, dates from 1724 A.D. Sa\u00e1dat Kh\u00e1n, the sixth Naw\u00e1b, first introduced the farming of the revenue, under which system the local governors bound themselves to pay a certain stated sum into the Government treasury, and were allowed to appropriate to themselves any surplus collections. This system is said to have worked well while its author ruled Oudh, and Bahraich was for a time peculiarly fortunate in its N\u00e1zims. The ten years\u2019 administration of Balki-d\u00e1s, and of his son R\u00e1i Amar Singh, from 1807 to 1816, was the most prosperous period that Bahraich experienced under native government; and it was not for some time that the evil effects of the farming system showed themselves. The second successor of R\u00e1i Amar Singh, H\u00e1di Al\u00ed Kh\u00e1n, commenced the practice of extortion by demanding an increase of one-eighth above the rates formerly paid. He found it difficult to realize this demand, and as a means to that end he favoured the system of the incorporation of the kh\u00e1ls\u00e1 lands (independent villages held under\ndirect engagement with the State) in the great talukd\u0101rs' estates. This policy was continued under his successors, until, between 1816 and 1856, 788 such villages were absorbed in the nine great estates. It was, however, during the farming of one Raghubar Dayal, who held the contract of the revenues for Bahraich and Gonda in 1846-47, that oppression rose to its height. His administration is described as 'a reign of terror, such as has seldom been experienced by any Province in the worst days of native rule.' A British officer who was deputed to report on the country that had suffered from this man, wrote as follows in 1849:\u2014'The once flourishing Districts of Gonda and Bahraich, so noted for fertility and beauty, are now for the greater part uncultivated. Villages completely deserted, in the midst of lands devoid of all tillage, everywhere meet the eye. From Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d to Bahraich, a distance of 80 miles, I passed over plains which had been well cultivated, but now lay entirely waste\u2014a scene for two years of great misery, ending in desolation.' The annexation of Oudh, in February 1856, put an end to this misrule and misery. British officers were appointed, police and revenue establishments reorganized, courts of justice established, and, most important of all, an equitable settlement of the land revenue effected. In doing this, as few changes as possible were made regarding title to property. Of 3682 villages which the talukd\u0101rs held in the year preceding annexation, the possession of 2998 was confirmed to them. Of the remainder, one estate, comprising 305 villages, was escheated for non-payment of revenue; for 230 deserted villages no settlement was made; while in 78 villages only were the talukd\u0101rs ousted in favour of rival claimants. The great landholders had been liberally dealt with, but on the outbreak of the Mutiny many of them preferred to return to the old state of lawlessness which had preceded the enforced peace and order of British rule. A section of them declared against us in 1857, and their estates, comprising 1418 villages, were transferred to other landholders who had remained loyal during the struggle.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The population of Bahraich District in 1869 was returned at 774,477, on an area estimated at 2645 square miles, showing a density of 293 per square mile. At the time of the Census of 1881, the area of the District, owing to transfers, had increased to 2740 square miles. The population in that year amounted to 878,048, namely, 459,187 males and 418,861 females, dwelling in 1896 villages, and occupying 177,314 houses. Average density of population, 320 per square mile, as against 293 in 1869; number of villages per square mile, 0\u00b769; persons per village, 462; houses per square mile, 64\u00b76; persons per house, 4\u00b79. In 1881, the Hindus numbered 734,241, or 83\u00b761 per cent. of the population; Muhammadans, 143,252, or 16\u00b708 per cent.; Sikhs, 459; Jains, 37; and Christians, 59. The higher-class Hindus\nare thus represented\u2014Br\u00e1hmans, 79,034, and R\u00e1jputs, 20,958. The disproportion of sex among the R\u00e1jputs, 12,059 males against only 8899 females, seems to indicate that the practice of female infanticide, formerly so common among R\u00e1jputs, has not yet been entirely suppressed. The Baniy\u00e1s or traders, 13,551 in number, and K\u00e1yasths or writer caste (9799), form the middle class. Of the lower class Hindus, the principal cultivating castes are\u2014Ah\u00edr, 103,319, the most numerous caste in the District; Kurm\u00ed, 85,560; Lodh\u00ed, 37,995; Kachhi, 23,484. The Garariya or shepherd caste numbered 17,393. The more important artisan castes are\u2014Barhai, carpenters, 10,676; Kumbhar, potters, 8807; Lohar, blacksmiths, 7826; and Telis, oil-pressers, 10,960. Castes engaged in domestic occupations\u2014Kah\u00e1r, palanquin-bearers, domestic servants, and labourers, 41,958; Dhobi, washermen, 13,083; N\u00e1i, barbers, 10,832; and Kalw\u00e1r, distillers, 8048. The very lowest castes\u2014Lon\u00ed, salt-makers by hereditary occupation, but now principally labourers, 17,082; Kori, cultivators and labourers, 47,454; Cham\u00e1r, leather-sellers, skinners, and labourers, 62,583; and P\u00e1s\u00ed, wine-sellers, 41,443. The Bhars, an ancient aboriginal ruling tribe, are now represented by only 173 persons. The Muhammadan community, including 930 R\u00e1jputs and G\u00fajars, are thus divided according to religion\u2014Sunn\u00eds, 140,804; and Shi\u00e1s, 2448. The population of the District is almost entirely rural, and only two towns contain a population of upwards of 5000 inhabitants, namely, BAHRAICH, 19,439; and NANPARA, 7351. The other towns of importance are\u2014JARWAL, BHINGA, and BAHRAMPUR. Of the 1896 villages or townships, 544 contained less than 200 inhabitants in 1881, 735 from 200 to 500, 464 from 500 to 1000, 126 from 1000 to 2000, 19 from 2000 to 5000, 6 from 3000 to 5000, 1 from 5000 to 10,000, and 1 upwards of 15,000.\n\nClassified according to occupation, the Census Report of 1881 returned the male population under the following six main groups:\u2014Class (1) Professional, 5471; (2) domestic, 2082; (3) commercial, 5552; (4) agricultural and pastoral, 253,170; (5) industrial and manufacturing, 25,471; and (6) indefinite and non-productive (including male children, general labourers, and unspecified), 167,441.\n\n**Agriculture.**\u2014The principal agricultural staples of the District are rice, Indian corn, barley, and wheat, which together cover 47.9 per cent. of the total cultivated area. Two great harvests are raised during the year, the kharif or winter, and the rabi or spring crops. According to the Revenue Administration Report for 1880\u201381, the total assessed area of the District is 2337 square miles, or 1,495,337 acres, of which 801,431 acres are under cultivation, 558,710 acres cultivable or grazing land, and 135,196 uncultivable waste. The total area under cultivation (including land bearing two crops), in 1880\u201381, is returned as follows:\u2014Rice, 240,639 acres; wheat, 137,746; other food-grains, 597,751;\noil-seeds, 87,649; sugar, 1,643; cotton, 4317; opium, 2983; indigo, 92; fibres, 1549; tobacco, 1372; vegetables, 3705; total, 1,079,446. The average holding of each cultivator is 5.25 acres. Irrigation in 1880-81 was carried out on 39,103 acres by private individuals. The method adopted is described in the article on Bara Banki District. The condition of the peasantry is said to be better in Bahraich than in any other part of Oudh, and to be fast improving. Rents, although high, are lower than in some Districts, and are reported to be 10 per cent. below the rates prevailing in Bara Banki. The official returns for 1880-81 give the average rates of rent per acre for land growing the different crops as follows:\u2014For rice land, 7s. 8d. per acre; wheat, 8s. 4d.; inferior grains, 7s. 4d.; indigo, 10s. 2d.; cotton, 6s. 9d.; opium, 16s. 2d.; oil-seeds, 7s. 8d.; fibres, 5s. 10d.; sugar-cane, 11s.; and tobacco, 16s. 2d. an acre. Rents are, however, commonly paid in grain at the rate of one-half the crop raised. A system of modified serfage is common here, as in other Districts east of the Gogra, by which a man receives an advance from a farmer of a sum varying from \u00a33 to \u00a310, and practically becomes his bond serf for life, receiving, however, one-sixth of the crop which he raises. Average produce of land per acre in 1880-81:\u2014Rice, 448 lbs.; wheat, 512 lbs.; inferior grains, 529 lbs.; indigo, 30 lbs.; cotton, 23 lbs.; opium, 6 lbs.; oil-seeds, 437 lbs.; fibres, 213 lbs.; sugar, 776 lbs.; tobacco, 544 lbs. per acre. The common rate of wages for agricultural labour is from 2d. to 3d. a day in money, with an allowance of parched grain, generally maize, worth about 1s. per month. A skilled labourer earns about 7\u00bdd. a day. Prices of food-grains are about 10 per cent. lower than those prevalent in Lucknow, but are rapidly rising. The rates at the end of the year ending 30th September 1881 were returned as follows:\u2014Wheat, 1st quality, 5s. 6d. per cwt.; wheat, 2nd quality, 4s. 11d. per cwt.; rice, 1st quality, 10s. 3d. per cwt.; rice, 2nd quality, 6s. 5d. per cwt.; gram, 1st quality, 4s. 1d. per cwt.; gram, 2nd quality, 3s. 9d. per cwt. The grains, however, which form the ordinary food of the people are much lower in price. The rates for other agricultural products were returned as follows:\u2014Sugar, white, \u00a32, 6s. od. per cwt.; sugar, raw, 11s. 3d. per cwt.; salt (Sambhar), 13s. 5d. per cwt.; ghi, \u00a33, 6s. od. per cwt.; cotton, \u00a32, 7s. od. per cwt.; linseed, 6s. 9d. per cwt.; jute, 7s. 2d. per cwt. The agricultural stock in the District in 1880-81 was returned as under:\u2014Cows and bullocks, 601,261; horses, 665; ponies, 11,216; donkeys, 5895; sheep and goats, 115,153; pigs, 19,915; carts, 7929; ploughs, 119,969; boats, 757. As indicated in the historical sketch, the land is held for the most part in talukdari tenure, the superior proprietary right resting in a single person, the lord of the domain; and perhaps in no District of Oudh was the feudalization of the country so complete on the annexation of the Province\nas in Bahrainch. These talukdari estates are 36 in number, comprising 1760 villages, the Government assessment on them (1881) being \u00a396,755. Of these 11 are ancestral, 7 were acquired during the 40 years preceding annexation, while 18 were confiscated for rebellion during the Mutiny, and conferred upon fresh owners as a reward for loyal service. The total agriculturists in the District in 1881 numbered 709,474, or 80\u00b780 per cent. of the total population. Average area of cultivated and cultivable land, 2\u00b723 acres per head of agricultural population. Total Government revenue, including cesses and rates levied on the land, \u00a3102,726, or an average of 2s. 7d. per cultivated acre. Total rental paid by cultivators, including cesses, \u00a3272,431, or an average of 6s. 9\u00bdd. per cultivated acre. Scarcity, caused by drought, is the most common natural calamity to which Bahrainch District is liable, the northern tracts being the first to feel the pinch of famine. The two least deaths occurred in 1869 and 1874. Inland communication is afforded by 597 miles of made road, while the navigable rivers and canals supply water communication for 253 miles. There is no line of railway at present open (1883) within the District, but the Patna-Bahrainch line in course of construction will intersect it from south to north. A bridge of boats is maintained across the Gogra at Bahrampur on the road to Lucknow during the dry season, replaced by a well-served ferry during the rains. Three other main and ten minor ferries are also kept up on the Gogra, and seven on the Rapti.\n\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014The trade of the District consists principally of the export down the rivers of grain, clarified butter (gh\u012b), and timber. Piece-goods, salt, and pulses form the chief imports. No statistics exist as to the value of the trade, which is registered in Faizabad District. The timber chiefly comes from the Nep\u00e1l forests, whence it is floated down the Kauriala and Rapti. The Government forests within the District have only been recently reserved, and have not as yet yielded much timber. In 1881, the Government reserved forests aggregated 257 square miles in area. The main timber mart in the District is Bahramgh\u00e1t on the Gogra, whence the logs are conveyed southward by road to Lucknow and Cawnpur. The manufactures of Bahrainch are confined to coarse cotton weaving, common throughout the District, a good quality of felt manufactured at Bahrainch and Jarwal towns, and excellent blankets woven at Charda in the north of the District.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The total revenue of the District in 1880-81 amounted to \u00a3118,065, of which \u00a397,717 was derived directly from the land. The total expense of civil administration, as represented by the cost of officials and police of all kinds, amounted in the same year to \u00a310,357. Fifteen civil and revenue and 13 magisterial courts are maintained in the District. The police force consists of three bodies\n\u2014the regular police, at the end of 1880, numbered 365 officers and men, maintained at a cost to the State of \u00a34996; a village watch, numbering 2161, and maintained by the villagers or landholders at an estimated cost (in money or land, or grain allowances) of \u00a37779; and a municipal force, for the towns of Bahraich and N\u00e1np\u00e1r\u00e1, of 73 officers and men, costing \u00a3374 from local funds. During the year 1880, the number of 'cognizable' cases taken in hand by the police was 7336, of which conviction was obtained in 916. The chief cases of grave crime during the year were\u2014murder, 7; dak\u00e1iti or gang-robbery, 3; robberies with violence, 11; housebreaking, 1562; ordinary theft, 1742. The Bahraich jail and lock-up received a total of 2331 prisoners during the year; average daily prison population, 338\u00b772.\n\nThe Government or aided educational institutions consist of the District school in Bahraich town, with three suburban branches, and 93 other schools, attended by a total of 4425 pupils in 1881, equal to an average of one school to every 29\u00b715 square miles of area, or 1 pupil to every 0\u00b75 per cent. of the population. This is exclusive of uninspected village schools, for which no returns are available. The Census Report returned only 3376 boys and 44 girls as under instruction, and 16,667 males and 28 females as able to read and write but not under instruction. Several of the landholders maintain schools at their own expense, and take a real interest in the spread of education.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate resembles in some points that of Bengal, being cooler than in Districts south of the Gogra, but more moist and enfeebling. Average annual rainfall, 45 inches. The prevalent diseases are fever, diarrhoea, goitre, and skin disorders. Five Government charitable dispensaries are maintained at Bahraich, N\u00e1np\u00e1r\u00e1, Kaisarganj, Ikauna, and Bhinga towns, with an annual average of 450 in-door and 44,915 out-door patients. [For further information regarding Bahraich, see the 'Report on the Revision of Settlement of the Bahraich District, effected by Major Edgar Gibson Clark, and Henry Scott Boys, of the Bengal Civil Service, 1865-1872.' The final report is by Mr. Boys, dated 1872.

Bounded on the north by N\u00e1np\u00e1r\u00e1 tahsil and the independent territory of Nep\u00e1l, on the east by Balr\u00e1mpur, on the south by Gonda District, and on the west by Kaisarganj tahsil. Area, 992 square miles, of which 436 are cultivated; pop. (1869) Hindus, 237,875; Muhammadans, 28,688; total, 266,563, viz. 138,803 males and 127,760 females; number of villages or towns, 721; average\ndensity of population, 266 per square mile. The tahsil consists of the four pargan\u00e1s of Bahraich, Ikauna, Bhinga, and Tulsipur.\n\n**Bahraich.\u2014**Pargan\u00e1 in Bahraich tahsil, Bahraich District, Oudh. Bounded on the north by Bhinga, Charda, and N\u00e1np\u00e1r\u00e1; on the east by Ikauna; and on the south and west by His\u00e1mpur and Fakhrpur pargan\u00e1s. The history of the pargan\u00e1 is included in the account of Bahraich District. Its present area is 329 square miles, with a maximum length from south-east to north-west of 32 miles, and an average breadth of 13 miles. Under native rule its area was three times as large, including the whole of Bhinga and Ikauna, besides portions of N\u00e1np\u00e1r\u00e1 and Charda. It forms a portion of the belt of high land which runs through the District in a south-easterly direction, having Bahraich and N\u00e1np\u00e1r\u00e1 towns on its south-western edge. This plateau, about 30 feet high, forms the watershed between the Gogra and R\u00e1pti rivers. The pargan\u00e1 is well wooded, some of the mango groves being of unusual size; but its most marked feature is the wide expanse of waste land. Out of a total area of 329 square miles, at the time of the settlement measurements, only 111 were under the plough. The soil is generally a good loam, consisting, as a rule, of two-thirds clay and one-third sand; and, with fair farming and irrigation, it will produce excellent crops. Government land revenue, \u00a310,256; average incidence, 2s. 7\u00bdd. per acre of cultivated area, 1s. 2d. per acre of assessable area; and 1s. 8\u00bdd. per acre of total area. Four roads lead from Bahraich town to Gonda, Ikauna, Bhinga, and N\u00e1np\u00e1r\u00e1, while cart tracks branch in every direction. The traffic is mainly grain, which is exported to the marts of Colonelganj and Naw\u00e1bganj, and via Bahramgh\u00e1t to Lucknow. Besides the town schools at Bahraich, Government schools are situated in four villages in the pargan\u00e1.\n\n**Bahraich.\u2014**Chief town and administrative head-quarters of Bahraich District, Oudh; situated in the centre of the District, on the road from Bahramgh\u00e1t to Nep\u00e1lganj. Lat. 27\u00b0 34' 52\" N., long. 81\u00b0 38' 2\" E. Population (1881) 19,439, namely, Muhammadians, 10,239; Hindus, 9088; Jains, 33; Christians, 50; and 'others,' 29. Males, 10,459, and females, 8980. Area of town site, 1745 acres. Municipal income in 1880\u201381, \u00a31446, or an average of 1s. 7\u00bdd. per head of population (21,981) within municipal limits. The town is in a flourishing condition, and its municipal income is quite sufficient for conservancy and police purposes, as well as to pay for extensive improvements. Its main thoroughfares are lighted at night, and the masonry drains well flushed daily with water from the public pumps. The residences of the European officers, and the Government buildings, lie on a high bank above the old bed of the Gogra (Gh\u00e1gra). An annual cattle fair was established here in 1881, and promises, now that the town has been fixed upon as the terminus\nof the Patn\u00e1-Bahraich Railway, to become an important one. The trade of the town is principally in articles of local consumption, the total value of goods paying octroi in 1870-71 being \u00a337,227, chiefly consisting of grain, sugar, gh\u012b, dried fruits, spices, etc. There is a fairly brisk local trade in piece-goods and copper utensils. The through traffic in 1870-71 was valued at \u00a321,959, comprising grain, sugar, gh\u012b, oil, timber, tobacco, hides, etc. Government District school; 12 lower-class schools. The American Methodist Mission has a station in the town, and maintains a school. Town police force, 60 of all ranks; Government dispensary. The principal building of interest is the shrine of Mas\u00e1\u00fad, a famous warrior and saint, who invaded Bahraich about 1033 A.D., and who, after several victories, was defeated and slain by the confederate Hindu princes. The shrine is maintained by the reputed descendants of some servants of the hero, and 150,000 pilgrims, both Muhammadans and Hindus, visit the place during an annual fair held in the month of Jaishtha. Tombs of his principal followers are also objects of veneration. A famous Muhammadan monastery still exists in the town, founded by a holy man from Mult\u00e1n about 1620. The Daulat-kh\u00e1n\u00e1, once a handsome range of buildings, now in ruins, was built by the Naw\u00e1b Asaf-ud-daul\u00e1, who frequently visited the District on hunting expeditions.\n\nBahramgh\u00e1t.\u2014Town in Bara Banki District, Oudh; on the right bank of the Gogra (Gh\u00e1gra) river. Lat. 27\u00b0 7' N., long. 81\u00b0 30' E. An important trading mart. A branch of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway runs to Bahramgh\u00e1t from the main line at Naw\u00e1bganj, and connects it with the capital, Lucknow, 39 miles distant; and a bridge of boats here spans the Gogra (Gh\u00e1gra), and opens up the country on the other side of the river. It is also connected by a metalled road with Naw\u00e1bganj, Lucknow, and Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d. The bridge and ferry tolls yield about \u00a32100 per annum. Considerable traffic is carried both by the railway and the bridge. The principal exports by train are gh\u012b, jo\u00e1r, timber, cotton seed, etc.; and the imports, piece-goods, salt, and linseed. The traffic over the bridge consists mainly of timber, rice and other food grains, oil-seeds, cattle, hemp, etc., from Bahraich on the north; and cotton cloth, salt, pulses, metal utensils, etc., from Southern Oudh and Cawnpur.\n\nBahr\u00e1mpur.\u2014Towns in Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d District, Bengal, and in Gan-j\u00e1m District, Madras.\u2014See BERHAMPUR.\n\nBahr\u00e1mpur.\u2014Town in Gurd\u00e1sipur District, Punjab; situated on the Kiran stream, 6 miles from Gurd\u00e1sipur town, and named after its founder Bahr\u00e1m Kh\u00e1n, one of Akbar's generals. Population (1881) 2682, comprising 1314 Muhammadans, 1211 Hindus, 121 Sikhs, and 3 Jains; number of occupied houses, 623.

The river is navigable as far as Olokh, 15 miles from its mouth; beyond this point it is not affected by the tide, and above it the river is fordable during the hot season. There is a legend that R\u00e1m\u00e1, when marching to Ceylon to rescue his wife S\u00edt\u00e1 from the ten-headed demon R\u00e1vana, halted at the river-side on the borders of Keunjhar; and, in commemoration of this event, large numbers of people visit the river every January. Chief tributaries, S\u00e1lnad\u00ed and Malai in Balasor District. Principal places on the banks, Anandapur, in Keunjhar State, and Olokh, and Ch\u00e1ndb\u00e1l\u00ed, in Balasor District.\n\n**Baj\u00e1na.**\u2014Tributary State within the Political Agency of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r in the Province of Guzer\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency, lying between $22^\\circ 57' 45''$ and $23^\\circ 10' 30''$ N. lat., and between $71^\\circ 39' 45''$ and $71^\\circ 59' 30''$ E. long.; situated inland between the Rann of Kachchh (Cutch) and Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d District. Population (1881) 15,881, distributed among 26 villages; estimated gross revenue, \u00a35200. The country is flat; the soil is light and in many places impregnated with salt, producing only cotton and the commoner varieties of grain; there are no rivers, and the supply of water is obtained entirely from wells. The climate is hot and dry. The prevailing disease is fever. Most of the inhabitants belong to a predatory class of Muhammadans called J\u00e1ts. There are no made roads. Communication is kept up by bullock carts and pack-bullocks. The nearest port is Dholera. There are four schools, with 99 pupils. Baj\u00e1na ranks as a fourth-class State among the many petty States of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. The ruler first entered into engagements with the British in 1807. The chief is a Muhammadan. He pays to the British Government a tribute of \u00a3798, exclusive of \u00a35, 14s. sukri on account of Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d, and maintains a military force of 232 men. He holds no sanad authorizing adoption; succession follows the rule of primogeniture. No transit duties levied.\n\n**Baj\u00e1na.**\u2014Chief town of the State of the same name in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, Bombay Presidency.

It is about 15 miles by river below Calcutta, and is noted as being the site of a fort captured from the forces of Sir\u00e1j-ud-daul\u00e1 by Clive in 1756. The inhabitants belong almost entirely to the fishing castes.\n\n**B\u00e1jitpur (B\u00e1zitpur).**\u2014Town and th\u00e1n\u00e1 (police station) in Maiman-\nSingh District, Bengal. Lat. $24^\\circ 12' 40''$ N., long. $90^\\circ 59' 43''$ E.; number of houses, 942. Population (1881) 4641, namely, males, 2232, and females, 2409.

The sub\u00e1hat comprises four pargan\u00e1s, namely, Ranod, P\u00e1char, Chachaura, and Bajrangarh; these are known as the Jaub\u00e1t, and are managed by a s\u00fabah for the chief, who is a tributary of Gwalior. Capital, Bajrangarh, in lat. $24^\\circ 34' N.$, long. $77^\\circ 18' E.$, where a fair is held in October, lasting 15 days.\n\n**Bajw\u00e1ra.**\u2014Village in Hoshi\u00e1rpur tahs\u00edl, Hoshi\u00e1rpur District, Punjab; $\\frac{1}{2}$ mile east of Hoshi\u00e1rpur. Population (1881) 2548. Said to have been formerly the principal place in this neighbourhood, and 'celebrated for cloth-weavers and pious Br\u00e1hmans.' A very ancient town, originally the head-quarters of the Nar\u00fa R\u00e1jputs. The buildings extend for 2285 acres, but the greater part now consists of ruins, and furnishes broken bricks for metalling roads. Contains a picturesque brick fort, one of the few in the District not dismantled since the advent of British rule. A considerable garrison was maintained here during the reign of Ranjit Singh and his successors. Until the cantonment was removed, the fort was used as a military prison for European soldiers. The fort was built by the K\u00e1ngra chief Saus\u00e1r, the limit of whose advance towards the plains it may be said to mark.\n\n**Bakaner.**\u2014Pargan\u00e1 of the Gwalior State, under the Bh\u00edl Agency of Central India.\n\n**B\u00e1karganj (Backergunge).**\u2014District in the Lieutenant-Governorship of Bengal, lying between $21^\\circ 48'$ and $23^\\circ 4' 45''$ N. lat., and between $89^\\circ 55'$ and $91^\\circ 4' 50''$ E. long.; area (1881) 3649 square miles; population, 1,900,889 souls. It forms the southernmost District of the Dacca Division, and is bounded on the north by the Districts of Dacca and Far\u00eddpur; on the east by the Meghn\u00e1 and Sh\u00e1hb\u00e1zpur rivers, separating it from No\u00e1kh\u00e1l\u00ed and Tipperah; on the south by the Bay of Bengal; and on the west by Jessor and Far\u00eddpur Districts. The Administrative head-quarters are at Bar\u00edsal, the chief town of the District, situated on the river of the same name.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014B\u00e1karganj is a typical part of the alluvial delta formed by the three great river systems of Bengal. It is watered by the united streams of the Ganges, the Brahmaputra, and the Meghn\u00e1, and traversed by innumerable rivers and watercourses, forming a most intricate network of channels, which are ever changing their courses. The whole District presents the appearance of an unbroken level,\nalthough there is a very slight and gradual decline from the east towards the west and north-west. There is not a hill or hillock in the whole District, but its scenery derives a beauty from the wide expanse of cultivation, and the greenness and freshness of the vegetation. The villages, which are always walled round by groves of bamboos and betel-nut palms, have a very picturesque appearance. The level of even the highest part of the District is only just sufficient to protect it from ordinary floods, while the western and north-western parts lie so low that the water of the numerous channels and streams collects in extensive marshes and swamps. These are often of great size and depth, abound in fish, and frequently during the rainy season over-spread the adjacent country. Among the principal swamps (jhils) are\u2014(1) B\u00e1gh\u00eda marsh, $30^\\circ 39$ square miles; (2) S\u00e1lt\u00ed marsh, $24^\\circ 71$ square miles; and (3) R\u00e1msil marsh, $21^\\circ 61$ square miles. The Survey Officer reports the following peculiarities with regard to some of these marshes:\u2014\u2018In some of the swamps, the surface growth of aquatic plants, mixed with drift weeds, grasses and rice stalks, increase annually, and in process of time a crust is formed capable of supporting human beings, and on which rice is cultivated. Small floating patches are thus formed, and the natives assert that in very strong winds these are sometimes carried from one side of the swamp to the other, and are the cause of great dispute. . . . It is not uncommon for the holders of these floating fields to make holes through them, and catch the fish which may be in the neighbourhood, and which are immediately attracted by the light.\u2019 On the southern face of the District, bordering the Bay of Bengal, lies the B\u00e1karganj portion of the Sundarbans or seaboard jungles. But in many parts the land has now been cleared almost to the sea. The river system of B\u00e1karganj consists of the offshoots from the great estuary of the Meghn\u00e1, and the tributaries and distributaries of the Ari\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n and the B\u00e1leswar, the two other principal rivers of the District. The numerous names given to these rivers in different parts of their courses cause great confusion. The Meghn\u00e1 estuary itself is called at different parts of its course the S\u00e1tb\u00e1ri\u00e1, the Ils\u00e1, the Tetuli\u00e1, and the Sh\u00e1hb\u00e1zpur; and the same perplexing multiplicity of names extends even to the smallest kh\u00e1l or watercourse, which the villagers on one side often call by a name quite different from that by which it is known on the other. These kh\u00e1ls intersect the District in every direction, and are so numerous that it is difficult to get about except by boat at any season of the year. Indeed, there are hardly any roads in the District, and every peasant has his own boat in which he moves from place to place.\n\nThe rivers and water channels are all navigable throughout the year, and subject to tidal action. The Collector thinks that there is not a single watercourse which is not navigable by boats of two tons burthen.\nat high water in the rainy season. During the rains nearly the whole country is under water. There is a very strong 'bore' at spring tides in the estuary of the Meghn\u00e1, and at that season the boatmen seldom venture on the river. Several large islands are formed by the Meghn\u00e1 near its mouth, the most important of which within the jurisdiction of B\u00e1karganj are Dakshin Sh\u00e1hb\u00e1zpur, M\u00e1npur\u00e1, Bh\u00e1dur\u00e1, and R\u00e1bna-b\u00e1d. Alluvion and diluvion are constantly taking place, especially towards the east, where the District is washed by the Meghn\u00e1. On the north and east of the island of Dakshin Sh\u00e1hb\u00e1zpur, the land is being rapidly cut away; and every year many homesteads, with their groves of betel-nut and cocoa-nut palms, fall into the river. On the other hand, large alluvial accretions are being formed in the estuary, the names of many of which, such as Victoria char, Alexander char, Falcon char, Brown char, Drummond char, Lord Harding's char, etc., indicate their recent origin.\n\nLittle has been done towards embanking rivers and marshes with a view to their reclamation and the extension of cultivation. The banks of the rivers and marshes produce large quantities of reeds, which are used for mat-making. Long-stemmed rice is extensively cultivated in the swamps. The seed is sown when the marshes are dry, or nearly so, and when the rains set in the plant shoots up with the rise of the water, and can be grown in water to a depth of from 18 to 20 feet.\n\nThe few trading villages to be found in the District are invariably situated on the banks of a stream, but the inhabitants do not love to congregate into villages. Each man builds his homestead on his own land, generally on the highest spot in his holding, without any reference to his neighbours; and as a rule, therefore, the homesteads are apart from each other. They are surrounded with dense plantations of cocoa-nut, and betel-nut palms and bamboos, presenting a very picturesque appearance. The principal places inhabited by a large community living by river traffic, are the following:\u2014(1) Nalchit\u00ed, on the Nalchit\u00ed river; principal imports, salt, tobacco, oil and sugar; exports, rice and betel-nuts. (2) Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jganj or Jh\u00e1lak\u00e1t\u00ed, on the Jh\u00e1lak\u00e1t\u00ed kh\u00e1l; imports and exports same as Nalchit\u00ed; also large market for sale of timber, especially sundr\u00ed wood. (3) M\u00e1d\u00e1r\u00edpur, on the Kum\u00e1r; imports, tobacco and oil; exports, jute. (4) S\u00e1hibganj, on the river of the same name; imports, salt, oil, tobacco and pulses; exports, rice, molasses, and sundr\u00ed wood. (5) Daulat Kh\u00e1n, in the island of Dakshin Sh\u00e1hb\u00e1zpur; principal exports, betel-nuts. The staples of the District, which are the chief support of the river traffic, are rice, cocoa-nuts and betel-nuts, among the exports; the chief import is salt. The rivers are only used for navigation purposes. Irrigation is scarcely known, although a small watercourse is occasionally dammed up for this purpose.\nThere are no mineral products, with the exception of salt. This can be extracted very easily from the soil, and is a frequent cause of breaches of the Salt Laws. In some of the islands in the Meghn\u00e1 the ground is quite white in the dry season from salt efflorescence. The only forests in the District are in the southern Sundarbans tract; they yield an abundant supply of timber and firewood, and some honey and wax, and give shelter to tigers, leopards, and other wild animals. Game-birds are very numerous in the District, and fish abound in all the streams, many of which also contain formidable crocodiles. There are no regular fishing towns or villages in the District, but most villages contain one or two fishermen's houses, and nearly every man fishes on his own account, either with net or rod, whenever he has leisure, and this contributes a good deal to his maintenance. Marabouts, kingfishers, flamingoes, cranes, pelicans, and wild geese are killed for the sake of their plumage, which is sent to Calcutta.\n\nAdministrative History.\u2014B\u00e1karganj probably formed part of Todar Mall's (1582) sark\u00e1r of Son\u00e1rg\u00e1on. In the readjustment of Bengal by Sult\u00e1n Shuj\u00e1 in 1658, the B\u00e1karganj portion of the Sundarbans is for the first time mentioned, under the name of Mur\u00e1dkh\u00e1n\u00e1. The next land settlement of Bengal was made by Naw\u00e1b Jafar Kh\u00e1n in 1721, during the reign of Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u00e1h. By this settlement, all Bengal was divided into thirteen chakl\u00e1s, one of which, chakl\u00e1 Jah\u00e1ng\u00edrnagar, included B\u00e1karganj and the Sundarbans. From the cession of Bengal to the East India Company in 1765 down to 1817, the District formed part of the Dacca Collectorate, but was administered by a judge and magistrate of its own, whose head-quarters were originally at the town of B\u00e1karganj, near the junction of the Krishnak\u00e1ti and Khair\u00e1b\u00e1d rivers. This station is now in ruins. In 1801, the administrative head-quarters were transferred to Baris\u00e1l. There have been numerous changes of jurisdiction in the District, the most important being the transfer (in 1859) to B\u00e1karganj of the large island of Daksh\u00edn Sh\u00e1hb\u00e1zpur, together with the adjacent sandbanks and islands (of which M\u00e1npur\u00e1 is the chief) from No\u00e1kh\u00e1li District. Up to quite recently, there were several discrepancies between the limits of the magisterial, revenue, and civil jurisdictions. In the northern part of the District, some villages within the M\u00e1d\u00e1r\u00edpur sub-division were within the criminal jurisdiction of Faridpur, and the civil and revenue jurisdiction of B\u00e1karganj. To remedy this discrepancy, the whole of M\u00e1d\u00e1r\u00edpur sub-division, with the exception of the Gaurnad\u00ed police circle, has been separated from B\u00e1karganj since 1872, and attached to Faridpur District.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The first systematic attempt at an enumeration of the people was in 1872, when the Census disclosed a population of 2,377,433 persons, inhabiting 4269 villages, and spread over an area of\n4935 square miles; average density of the population, 482 per square mile. Reductions in area have since taken place by transfers to other Districts. On an area corresponding to that of the present District, the population in 1872 was 1,887,586. The Census of 1881 returned the population at 1,900,889, on an area of 3649 square miles, or an increase of 13,303 over the same area in 1872. The District population in 1881 resided in 4336 towns and villages, and inhabited 222,912 houses; average density of population, 520'93 per square mile; number of houses, 63'83 per square mile; inhabitants per occupied house, 8'53. Divided according to sex, males numbered 973,479, and females 927,410. Classified according to religion, there were\u2014Muhammadans, 1,267,694; Hindus, 624,597; Christians, 3717; Buddhists (chiefly Magh immigrants from Arakan), 4797; Brahmos, 83; Jew, 1. The principal Hindu and semi-Hindu castes were as follow:\u2014Br\u00e1hman, 44,736; Chand\u00e1l, the most numerous caste in the District, constituting the great mass of Hindu cultivators, 260,771; Dhobi, 21,628; Jal\u00edy\u00e1, 13,298; Jugi, 21,518; Kaibartt\u00e1, 18,880; K\u00e1yasth, 87,834; N\u00e1pit, 33,499; Sur\u00ed, 16,845. Hindus, not recognising caste, were returned as numbering 5286. The Muhammadans are, almost without exception, descendants of converts from Hinduism, and do not differ either ethnically or linguistically from their Hindu neighbours. Of the 3717 Christians, 2892 were natives or descendants of native converts. The male population was divided according to occupation into the following six classes:\u2014(1) Professional class, including Government, military, and civil officials, and the learned professions, 20,497; (2) Domestic servants, hotel and lodging-house keepers, etc., 9864; (3) Commercial class, including merchants, general dealers, carriers, etc., 43,863; (4) agricultural and pastoral castes, including gardeners, 437,441; (5) manufacturing, artisan, and other industrial classes, 69,610; (6) indefinite and non-productive (comprising 11,836 general labourers, 1663 men of rank and property without occupation, and 378,705 unspecified, including children), 378,705. During the 17th and 18th centuries the Maghs or Arakanese made regular raids in fleets of armed vessels up the rivers of Eastern Bengal, causing so much devastation that, in one of the early maps, a considerable tract is marked \u2018depopulated by the Maghs.\u2019 The Magh settlers in B\u00e1karganj have subsided under British rule into quiet, peaceable, and industrious communities. They are nominally Buddhists, but, from long residence in a District where Buddhism is unknown, nearly all traces of their religion have been obliterated, and many of them have embraced Hinduism. They are fond of their old homes, to which they occasionally make short visits. They adhere to their own mode of living, intermarry only among themselves, and build their dwellings on the model of Burmese houses. They first settled in the Sundarbans more\nthan a hundred years ago, when they fled from their country, during the war between the Burmese and Arakan R\u00e1j\u00e1s, which ended in the conquest of Arakan. Amongst the Muhammadans, the Far\u00e1iz\u00eds, a puritan, but here a not actively fanatical, sect, deserve special mention. They are very numerous in B\u00e1karganj, especially in the southern parts of the District, but the original home of the sect was in Faridpur, and a brief account of its origin and rise will be found in the article on that District.\n\nThe material condition of the people is good. With scarcely an exception, every man is a small landholder, and cultivates sufficient rice and other necessaries for the support of his family. Owing to this cause, hired labour is very scarce, and during the harvest season, when the few available labourers are eagerly bid for by the landholders, the price of labour rises to a shilling per diem. The diet of the people consists principally of rice, fish, and vegetables; but the Muhammadans, whenever rich enough to do so, indulge in animal food, particularly fowls and goats. Except in the larger villages, the dwellings of the people are very isolated, especially in the south of the District, where the homesteads are far apart from each other, with dense plantations of cocoa-nut and betel-nut trees surrounding each. Accordingly, families have little communication with each other, and neighbourly visits are seldom exchanged. The population of B\u00e1karganj is purely rural, and there is no tendency to gather into towns. Only three towns contain more than 5000 inhabitants, viz. the civil station of Barisal, population 13,186; B\u00e1karganj, 7060; and Bauphal, 5055. In addition, there are three other towns, or rather large villages, viz. Nalchiti, Jhalakati or Mahar\u00e1jganj, and Pirozpur\u2014all considerable trading places. Jh\u00e1lak\u00e1t\u00ed is one of the largest timber markets in Eastern Bengal, especially for the sale of sundri wood, which is exported to Calcutta and elsewhere for fuel. Daulat Kh\u00e1n is the principal village in the island of Daksh\u00edn Sh\u00e1hb\u00e1zpur, but the head-quarters of that Sub-division are at Bhola. Amongst the other trading villages of the District may be mentioned\u2014S\u00e1hibganj, Angari\u00e1, Sayyidpur, and Jabar Aml\u00e1. The towns and villages are thus classified in the Census returns of 1881:\u2014Villages with less than 200 inhabitants, 1656; from 200 to 500, 1484; from 500 to 1000, 759; from 1000 to 2000, 341; from 2000 to 3000, 70; from 3000 to 5000, 23; from 5000 to 10,000, 2; from 10,000 to 15,000, 1: total, 4336 villages and towns. Fairs are held in November at L\u00e1khuti\u00e1, B\u00e1nar\u00edp\u00e1ra, and Kulsok\u00e1t\u00ed; in October at Jh\u00e1lak\u00e1t\u00ed, and in March at Pirozpur. These are not religious gatherings, but meetings for general amusement and trade; the largest of them is attended by five or six thousand persons.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Rice forms the staple crop of the District, and indeed is the only cereal grown to any extent. It consists of three sorts\u2014\u00e1man, or\nwinter rice; *\u00e1us*, the autumn crop; and *boro*, or spring rice. These are sub-divided into more than a hundred well-recognised varieties. The *\u00e1man*, which is the most important crop, is sown on the setting in of the rains in April or May, transplanted between the beginning of June and the middle of August, and reaped in November and December. It requires much care, as it will not grow unless the ears can be kept well above the flood-water. *Aus* rice is sown in spring and the early part of the hot weather, and reaped in August. In many parts of the District it is transplanted like the *\u00e1man* crop, but in the northern portion it is simply sown broadcast. The *boro* crop is generally sown broadcast in December, and reaped in April or May; it is also sometimes transplanted. Among the other crops of the District are mustard, pulses (*khes\u00e1ri* and *mus\u00fari*), linseed, betel-nuts, cocoa-nuts, sugar-cane, safflower, and *p\u00e1n*. Jute is grown in the northern part of the District.\n\nOf the total area, nearly three-fourths are under cultivation. Rice lands yield from 12 cwts. of unhusked rice per acre in the case of inferior land, to as much as 43 cwts. in the case of very fine land; a good average out-turn is from $17\\frac{1}{2}$ to 22 cwts. per acre. The price of paddy varies, but it is seldom worth to the cultivator more than 2s. 8d. a cwt.; and, speaking generally, a husbandman would be glad if he could sell it on the ground at 2s., the price in many places being as low as 1s. 6d. or 1s. 8d. a cwt. From the above figures it will be seen that it is not easy to estimate the value of the rice crop per acre; an average calculation which has been made, however, shows the ordinary net profit to the cultivator to be, all things considered, about \u00a31, 10s.\n\nThe condition of the peasantry is on the whole satisfactory; almost every man has his own little plot of ground, on which he grows sufficient for the wants of his family. The average size of these little farms is about four acres; a fair-sized comfortable holding would be from five to seven acres in extent. Very few peasants cultivate as much as seventeen acres. A single pair of oxen is able to cultivate from five to five and a half acres of land.\n\nAct x. of 1859, although extensively worked, has not caused a general enhancement of rent, but it has tended to render rents uniform, and to enhance rates on lands which were held on terms unduly favourable to the cultivator. Rates of rent vary considerably, according to the situation and quality of the soil; rice land rents at from 3s. to 18s. per acre; sugar-cane and *p\u00e1n* plantations at \u00a31, 4s.; homestead land surrounding dwellings at from 9s. to 30s. Wages generally have doubled during the last few years, the present average rates being as follows:\u2014Coolies, 6d. a day; agricultural day-labourers, 6d., 8d., or 1s. a day, according to the season and demand; bricklayers, carpenters, etc., when not paid by the job, 30s. to 40s. a month. Although the prices of food have also risen, the increase has not been so marked as\nin the case of wages. The best cleaned rice in 1881-82 sold at from 5s. 6d. to 6s. 2d. a cwt., and common husked rice at from 4s. 9d. to 5s. 3d.\n\n**Land Tenures.**\u2014There is not much spare land in the District, except in the forests of the Sundarban tracts. Land tenures, of a favourable nature to the cultivators, and indicating the existence of surplus lands, are not common. In former days, however, a tenure prevailed called *jangal-buri*, for the cultivation of jungle and waste lands. Many persons undertook to cultivate such tracts, and these newly reclaimed lands were constituted *t\u00e1lus*, and included in the rent-roll of the nearest *zamind\u00e1r*. If the *t\u00e1lukd\u00e1r* died leaving heirs, the latter obtained possession of the lands; but if without heirs, the *zamind\u00e1r* managed the land on behalf of Government. The various intermediate tenures between the superior landlord and the actual cultivators are as follow:\u2014\n\n*T\u00e1luk, ausat t\u00e1luk, n\u00edm ausat t\u00e1luk, hawal\u00e1, n\u00edm hawal\u00e1, ausat n\u00edm hawal\u00e1, mir\u00e1sh karsh\u00e1, and kaim\u00ed karsh\u00e1.* The word *n\u00edm* when used in naming a tenure, generally indicates that it is a sub-division of the parent tenure, *i.e.* that the rights of the sub-tenant do not extend to the whole, but only to a portion of the land included within the parent tenure; the word *ausat* simply means subordinate, and signifies a dependent tenure; *mir\u00e1sh karsh\u00e1* and *kaim\u00ed karsh\u00e1* are hereditary cultivators' tenures held at a fixed rent. To this must be added the *ij\u00e1ra*, or ordinary farming lease, and its sub-tenure *dar ij\u00e1ra*, and which may be attached to any of the foregoing tenures. Most of the land in the District has passed from the hands of the superior holders into those of intermediate holders, and there is no District in Bengal in which the sub-division of tenures has been carried to a greater extent. Except in the case of newly-formed alluvial lands, it is rare to find an instance in which there are not two or three middlemen between the proprietor of the soil and the actual cultivator. Most of the husbandmen are thought to possess rights of occupancy.\n\n**Natural Calamities.**\u2014B\u00e1karganj is subject to blight, which cannot, however, be said to materially affect the prosperity of the District, and to flood, which often causes much injury. These floods are generally occasioned either by the rising of the rivers before they enter the District, or by the high tides which accompany cyclones. One of the most serious floods of the present century took place in 1822, in which it was estimated that nearly 40,000 people lost their lives; the loss of cattle was estimated at 98,830 head, and the value of miscellaneous property destroyed, at \u00a3132,669; the records of the Collectorate were also swept away and totally destroyed. Other destructive floods have occurred since then, in 1825, 1832, 1855, 1867, 1869, and 1870. In November 1876 the islands at the mouth of the Meghn\u00e1 were swept by a terrible cyclone and storm wave, which\ncaused a great loss of life, and was followed by a severe outbreak of cholera. The erection of protective works against these inundations would involve enormous expenditure; no such works exist at present. B\u00e1karganj is not liable to famines, and did not suffer during 1866, although prices rose considerably in that year, owing to the greatly increased export of rice to other parts of the country. The maximum price of paddy during the famine of 1866 was 8s. 10\u00bdd. a cwt., and of husked rice 17s. 1d. a cwt. If these rates were reached in January or February, and if the rise of prices was known to be caused by the failure of the crops within the District, famine might reasonably be expected later in the year. A deficient rainfall, which in other Districts would seriously diminish the crop, might in B\u00e1karganj prove rather beneficial than otherwise.\n\nCommerce and Trade, etc.\u2014The trade of the District is for the most part carried on at river-side markets, the principal of which have already been mentioned; but a good deal of business is also done at the fairs, which are attended by large numbers of people. The chief exports are rice, betel-nuts, cocoa-nuts, sundri wood, and jute; the principal imports\u2014piece-goods, salt, tobacco, oil, oil-seeds, pulses, etc. The exports greatly exceed the imports in value. The only manufactures of the District are pottery, coarse cloth, oil, gur or molasses, and fine mats; of these only the pottery, which is of excellent quality, is exported. The condition of the manufacturing classes is fairly prosperous. Manufactures are carried on by the people in their own houses and on their own account; the employment of hired labour for such purposes is rare. Several indigo factories formerly existed, but the manufacture has long since ceased. Native banking establishments are carried on in the towns of B\u00e1sis\u00e1l, Jh\u00e1lak\u00e1ti, S\u00e1hibganj and Nalchit\u00ed, but loans are conducted by all classes, whether agricultural or commercial, who have spare money at their disposal. The few roads in the District are very short, and are not maintained by the Public Works Department; regular communication being, as already mentioned, conducted entirely by water.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1818, the first year after its separation from Dacca, the net revenue of B\u00e1karganj was \u00a396,438, and the net civil expenditure, \u00a313,647. By 1860\u201361, the net revenue had increased to \u00a3150,305, and the net civil expenditure to \u00a332,584\u2014that is to say, between 1818 and 1860, the revenue of the District increased by 55 per cent., while the expenditure more than doubled, the increase being 139 per cent. In 1870\u201371, the net revenue of the District had further risen to \u00a3203,445 (showing an increase since 1860 of 35 per cent.), and the civil expenditure to \u00a344,902, or an increase since 1860 of 38 per cent. In 1880\u201381 the revenue had increased to \u00a3216,049, of which the principal items were the following:\u2014Land revenue,\n\u00a3146,285; excise, \u00a38254; stamps, \u00a343,470; registration, \u00a35754; and road cess, \u00a310,274. In 1818, there were 1 magisterial court and 3 revenue and civil courts in the District; in 1850, there were 3, and in 1869, 8 magisterial courts, the number of revenue and civil courts in these years being 10 and 15 respectively. In 1880-81, there were 14 revenue and civil judges, and 15 magistrates, exclusive of honorary magistrates. For police purposes, B\u00e1karganj is divided into 16 police circles (th\u00e1n\u00e1s), namely, B\u00e1ris\u00e1l, B\u00e1karganj, Medhiganj, Gaurnadi, Jh\u00e1lak\u00e1t\u00ed, and Nalch\u00edt\u00ed in the head-quarters Sub-division; Patu\u00e1kh\u00e1l\u00ed, Bauphal, Gulsakh\u00e1l\u00ed, and Gulach\u00edpa in Patu\u00e1kh\u00e1l\u00ed Sub-division; Pirozpur, Bhandaria, Swarupk\u00e1t\u00ed, and Matb\u00e1ri in Pirozpur Sub-division; and Bhola and Barhan-ud-d\u00edn Halar in Dakshin Sh\u00e1hbazpur Sub-division. In 1880, the regular police force numbered 507 men of all ranks, maintained at a total cost of \u00a311,471. There was also a municipal force of 113 officers and men, costing \u00a3696, and a rural police or village watch of 4378, maintained by the zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs at an estimated cost of \u00a312,828. The total machinery, therefore, for the protection of person and property consisted of 4998 officers and men, giving one man to every '73 square mile, or to every 460 of the population. The total cost was \u00a324,935, equal to an average of \u00a34, 19s. 9d. per square mile of area, and 3\u00bdd. per head of the population. Murders and riots are common in B\u00e1karganj. The frequency of this and other crimes, such as d\u00e1k\u00e1ti or gang-robbery, has been attributed to the isolation of the dwellings, together with the consequent freedom of the people from those restraining influences which a community exercises on the members constituting it. B\u00e1karganj contains one District jail, and three subsidiary prisons. Daily average jail population in 1880, 455\u00b756. Education till lately was in a very backward state in the District, a fact which is explained by the circumstance that, except at the civil station, almost the entire community is composed of peasants and fishermen, all intent upon earning their daily food, and caring nothing for an education which will not assist them to do so. A small triangular tract between the Baris\u00e1l, Ari\u00e1l Kh\u00e1n, and Swar\u00fapk\u00e1t\u00ed rivers, in the centre of the District, contained nearly all the State schools. The number of Government and aided schools in 1860-61 was 3, attended by 389 pupils; in 1870-71, the number of such schools was 67, and of the pupils attending them, 3116. Since Sir George Campbell's Educational reforms in 1873, by which the grant-in-aid system was extended to primary schools, education has received a considerable impetus, and in 1880, 703 schools, attended by 21,357 pupils, were returned as receiving State assistance. The number of unaided inspected primary schools in the same year was returned at 192. The Census Report in 1881 returned 34,787 boys and 1127 girls as under instruction, besides 79,733 males and 1482 females as able to read and write, but\nnot under instruction. The District is divided into 4 administrative Sub-divisions, namely, Baris\u00e1l, Daksh\u00edn Sh\u00e1hb\u00e1zpur, P\u00edrozpur, and Patu\u00e1kh\u00e1l\u00ed.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The climate of B\u00e1karganj is said to be one of the healthiest in Eastern Bengal, owing to the strong south-west monsoon, which blows up fresh from the sea, and keeps the atmosphere cool. But the heavy rainfall and consequent humidity of the atmosphere, combined with the use of bad water, act as sources of disease. The average monthly temperature varies from $78^\\circ$ F. minimum to $85^\\circ$ maximum, the thermometer ranging from $62^\\circ$ to $98^\\circ$. The rainfall in 1881 was 99.26 inches at Baris\u00e1l, the average for the previous 15 years being 77.28 inches. The principal endemic diseases are fevers of all kinds and cholera; the latter disease and small-pox occasionally occur as epidemics. Cattle disease has been prevalent of late years.

Course, easterly. Springs impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen are found in the bed of the stream, with hot and cold jets within a few feet of each other, about 8 miles west of Suri. One mile south of Tantifs\u00e1r\u00e1 village a group of hot sulphur springs (named Bh\u00fam B\u00e1keswar) attracts an annual concourse of pilgrims, whose piety has erected a little temple city of more than 300 brick shrines to Mah\u00e1deo on the river bank.\n\nBakhar.\u2014Fortified island in the Indus, Shik\u00e1rpur District, Sind, Bombay Presidency.\u2014See Bukkur.\n\nBakhr\u00e1.\u2014Village in Muzaffarpur District, Bengal.

It drains the central marsh lying between the D\u00e1modar and the R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1yan.\n\n**Bakhtgarh.**\u2014Petty State or guaranteed Th\u00e1kur\u00e1t in the Bhil Agency, under the Central India Agency. The present chief, Prat\u00e1p Singh, was adopted in 1869 by the widow of his predecessor, with the consent of the Dh\u00e1r Darb\u00e1r, and was invested with full powers on attaining his majority in 1882. A payment of Hali rupees 16,502 is annually made to the Dh\u00e1r State, under a settlement dating back to 1818. The State comprises 35 villages, 3 of which are in\u00e1m or revenue free; revenue in 1880, \u00a34248.\n\n**Bakhtiarpur.**\u2014Village and station on the East Indian Railway, in Patna District, Bengal; nearest station for Behar or Naw\u00e1d\u00e1.

It is built immediately under the tank dam, and the streets are therefore usually under water; fever and cholera are almost endemic. The village was founded in 1364, on one end of the dam, of which Anant\u00e1s\u00e1garam (Anant\u00e1pur) forms the other.\u2014See ANANTASAGARAM.\n\n**Bakloh.**\u2014Town and small hill cantonment in the extreme north-east of Gurd\u00e1spur District, Punjab, on the borders of Ch\u00e1mba State.

A good deal of timber is brought down the stream from Nep\u00e1l.\n\n**Baksar.**\u2014Village in Un\u00e1o District, Oudh, on the left bank of the Ganges, 34 miles south-east of Un\u00e1o town. The first seat of the Bais clan, conquered by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Abh\u00e1i Ch\u00e1nd. Population (1881) 1314, namely, Hindus, 1184; and Muhammadans, 130. Annual fair in the month of K\u00e1rtik, when 100,000 people assemble to bathe in the Ganges, which is held to be particularly sacred at this place, where there is a famous temple dedicated to the goddess Ch\u00e1ndika. Village school and Sanskrit p\u00e1lis\u00e1la. This little village has acquired a modern interest from its connection with the Cawnpur massacre of July 1857. A single boat-load of fugitives had managed to escape from the scene of butchery.\non the river at Cawnpur; but after two days' pursuit by the mutineers, who lined both banks, and the slaughter of the majority of its occupants, it ran upon a sandbank near Baksar. The fire of the enemy prevented the boat being got afloat again, and 14 of its occupants landed to attempt to drive them off. Major De la Fosse, one of the survivors, thus tells the story:\u2014\u2018Directly we got on shore the insurgents retired; but having followed them up too far, we were cut off from the river, and had ourselves to retire as we were being surrounded. We could not make for the river, but had to go down parallel, and came at the river again a mile lower down, where we saw a large force of men right in front waiting for us, and another lot on the other bank, should we attempt to cross the river. On the bank of the river, just by the force in front, was a temple. We fired a volley and made for the temple, in which we took shelter, one man being killed and one wounded. From the door of the temple we fired on every insurgent who showed himself. Finding they could do nothing against us while we remained inside, they heaped wood all round and set it on fire. When we could no longer remain inside, on account of the smoke and heat, we threw off the clothes we had, and, each taking a musket, charged through the fire. Seven of us out of twelve got into the water; but before we had gone far two poor fellows were shot. There were only five left now, and we had to swim, while the insurgents followed us along both banks, wading, and firing as fast as they could. After we had gone about 3 miles down the stream, one of our party, an artilleryman, to rest himself, began swimming on his back, and not knowing in what direction he was swimming, got on shore, and was killed. When we had gone down about 6 miles, firing on both sides ceased; and soon after we were hailed by some natives on the Oudh side, who asked us to come on shore, and said that they would take us to their R\u00e1j\u00e1, who was friendly to the English. We gave ourselves up, and were taken 6 miles inland to the R\u00e1j\u00e1 [the late Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Sir Digbijai Singh, K.C.S.I., to whom this village and considerable other estates in Oudh were awarded as a recognition of his loyalty], who treated us very kindly, giving us clothes and food.\u2019 Besides Major De la Fosse, the others who escaped were Captain Mowbray Thomson and two privates\u2014the sole survivors of the Cawnpur massacre. The boat from which the party had landed was overtaken by the mutineers, and the remaining occupants conveyed back to Cawnpur, where they were slaughtered by order of the N\u00e1n\u00e1.\n\nB\u00e1kud Creek.\u2014A short, deep branch of the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed river, in Cuttack District, Bengal. It is the more southerly of the two channels leading inland from the anchorage at False Point, and it is also the more direct of the two for navigation. A bar, about 1000 yards long, lies across the mouth, and is dry during the last quarter of the ebb.\nAt full tide, however, cargo-boats and steamers enter easily. Beyond the bar a channel of 2 feet is obtained, gradually deepening to 8, then shoaling again to 2, and eventually deepening into an excellent channel of 14 to 20 feet up to its junction with the Mah\u00e1nadi, a distance of about 16 miles. In this creek Government established its rice depot for throwing supplies into Orissa from the sea during the great famine of 1866.\n\n**B\u00e1l\u00e1ganj.**\u2014Village in Sylhet District, Assam, on the Lower Bar\u00e1k or Kusiy\u00e1ra river, with a large river-borne trade in rice, jute, oil-seeds, and *sitalp\u00e1ti* mats. Lat. 24\u00b0 39' 15\" N., long. 91\u00b0 52' 15\" E. In 1876\u201377 the registered exports into Bengal included 137,800 *maunds* of rice, 7000 of paddy, and 3400 of jute; the imports included \u00a318,300 of piece-goods, and 17,340 *maunds* of salt.\n\n**B\u00e1l\u00e1garh.**\u2014Town in H\u00fagl\u00ed District, Bengal, situated on the right bank of the H\u00fagl\u00ed river. Population (1881) 11,233, namely, Hindus, 9941, and Muhammadans, 1292. The town and surrounding villages, covering an area of 8000 acres, has been constituted a Municipal Union. Population within municipal limits, 16,662; municipal income (1880\u201381), \u00a3393; expenditure, \u00a3454.\n\n**B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t** ('Above the Gh\u00e1ts').\u2014Name given to certain Districts of the old Vijayanagar kingdom of the Karnatic, to distinguish them from the Karnatic *payangh\u00e1t*, the Districts 'below the gh\u00e1ts' now called 'The Karnatic.' Lat. 8\u00b0 10' to 16\u00b0 N., long. 77\u00b0 20' to 80\u00b0 10' E. The Districts of Bellary, Karn\u00fal (Kurnool), and Cuddapah are still locally known as the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t.\n\n**B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t.**\u2014The upland country of Ber\u00e1r (in contradistinction to the *payangh\u00e1t* or lowland tract), above the Ajanta ridge, sloping southwards beyond the gh\u00e1ts or passes which lead up to it. Here is the extreme northern limit of the table-land of the Dakshin (Deccan). Lakenw\u00e1di gh\u00e1t, the gateway to the B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t, is in lat. 20\u00b0 29' N., and long. 76\u00b0 37' E.\n\n**B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t.**\u2014District in the N\u00e1gpur Division of the Chief-Commissionership of the Central Provinces, lying between 21\u00b0 18' and 22\u00b0 25' N. lat., and 79\u00b0 42' and 81\u00b0 4' E. long. It forms an irregular quadrilateral, with its northern base resting on Mandl\u00e1 District, bounded on the west by Seoni; on the south by Bhandar\u00e1; and on the east by R\u00e1ipur. Population in 1881, 340,554 souls; area, 3146 square miles. The administrative head-quarters are at Burha.\n\n**Physical Aspects.**\u2014Geographically, the District is composed of three distinct tracts\u2014(1) The southern low-lands comprising the *pargan\u00e1s* of Hatt\u00e1, Dhansu\u00e1, and Lanj\u00ed, together with a tract recently added to B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t, from the District of Seoni, on the west. (2) A long narrow valley, known as the Man *t\u00e1luka*. (3) A lofty plateau, known as the R\u00e1igarh Bochhi\u00e1 tract. The first portion consists of a slightly undulat-\ning tract, comparatively well cultivated, and drained by the Waingang\u00e1, B\u00e1gh, Deo, Ghisri, and Son rivers. On its northern and north-eastern edge it is fringed with a belt of forest, which extends from one to five miles from the base of the hills, and at places along the banks of the river. Elsewhere the country is quite open, the quality of the land varying from the water-scoured soil on the banks of the Waingang\u00e1, to rich alluvial black deposits. The second portion is a long, narrow, irregular-shaped lowland tract, composed of a series of small valleys, intersected by light micaceous granite hill ranges covered with dense jungle. From the main range to the Waingang\u00e1, this tract varies in breadth from five to twenty miles. The soil, as a rule, is of a somewhat inferior quality, and requires a full supply of water to produce good crops; but ample facilities for irrigation exist. The third tract, which comprises the greater part of the District, is a vast undulating plateau, broken into numerous valleys by irregular ranges of hills running generally from east to west. The general level of these valleys is about 800 or 900 feet above the surrounding plains, and nearly 2000 feet above sea level. Some of the peaks, however, reach from 2300 to 3000 feet above sea level. By far the greater portion of these highlands is covered with dense jungle, the villages consisting, almost without exception, of collections of ten or twelve Gond or Baiga temporary huts, which remain for about two years, and are then burnt by their inhabitants, who migrate to other places in search of virgin soil. The quality of the soil of this tract ranges from the richest black alluvium, to a stony uncultivable soil in the proximity of the higher peaks.\n\nThe greater part of the District is drained by the Waingang\u00e1 and its tributaries above named, but most of the streams which rise in the upper country find their way into the Narbad\u00e1 (Nerbudda). There are no lakes in B\u00e1lagh\u00e1t. The forests are very extensive, and cover the greater part of the north of the District. The finest of these is the large s\u00e1l reserve of Topl\u00e1 in the north-east corner, where the trees are magnificent. But little teak of value is now to be found, owing to reckless destruction by the aboriginal tribes in making clearings for their nomadic cultivation. The forests are now being protected, and in 1880-81, 950 square miles were \u2018reserved\u2019 and in charge of the Forest Department. The working of the Department in that year showed a total revenue, from the sale of timber and forest produce, of \u00a33180, against an expenditure of \u00a3767, leaving a net profit of \u00a32413. Stunted timber, and patches of scrub and jungle, are scattered about the plains. On the banks of the Deo and the Son is found the large katang bamboo, specimens of which have been exhibited 90 feet in length. The jungle is tenanted by game of every kind, from the bison and buffalo, which range the hill summits, to the fox and hare in the plains below.\n\nThere is every reason to suppose that the mineral wealth of the high-\nland tract is considerable, although the country has been only partially explored. Gold is washed in many of the hill streams, although the quantity obtained scarcely suffices to repay the labour. Iron in large quantities is found in many places, and is extensively worked by the Gonds, who smelt it into rough semicircular shapes called chul\u00e1s, averaging about 10 lbs. in weight, and which are sold in the b\u00e1z\u00e1r at the rate of from two to four for the rupee. Red ochre is found, and is used by the people for dyeing purposes, and sulphide of antimony (surm\u00e1) occurs in large quantities. Mica is abundant, but it has not yet been met with in sheets of sufficient size to make it commercially valuable.\n\nHistory.\u2014The early history of the lowlands before the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 invasion is uncertain, but more than a century ago they were absorbed by the Bhonsla rulers of N\u00e1gpur. The upper country was held by the Garh\u00e1 Mandl\u00e1 kings until their subjugation by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. The Buddhist temples of cut stone would seem to indicate a comparatively high civilization at some remote period; but whatever prosperity now exists in the highlands has been created within the memory of man. Less than a century ago a primeval wilderness reigned throughout these regions; and it is owing to the enterprise of one Lachhman Na\u00edk, and of the immigrants whom he introduced about 1810, that Parasw\u00e1r\u00e1 and its 30 neighbouring villages are now flourishing settlements, surrounded by excellent rice fields, which never lack water even in the driest season. It is the aim of the English administration to foster such endeavours to people the waste; and the records of this process are likely for some time to form the history of B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t.\n\nPopulation.\u2014The Census of 1872 disclosed a population of 195,008 persons, and an area of 2608 square miles. The subsequent transfer of a considerable tract from Seoni, increased B\u00e1l\u00e1gh\u00e1t District to its present area of 3146 square miles, with a population in 1872 of 301,780. The Census of 1881 returned a population of 340,554, or an increase of 38,774 on the corresponding area in 1872. The District population in 1881 resided in 1211 towns and villages, and inhabited 69,034 houses; average density of population, 108\u00b72 per square mile; number of houses, 21\u00b794 per square mile; inhabitants per occupied house, 4\u00b793. Divided according to sex, there were\u2014males, 168,830, and females, 171,704. Classified according to religion, Hindus numbered 241,216; Sikhs, 6; Kab\u00edrpanthis, 8574; Jains, 125; Muhammadans, 6541; Christians, 36; and aboriginal tribes still retaining their primitive forms of faith, 84,056. The principal Hindu castes with their numbers are as follow:\u2014R\u00e1jputs, 2452; Ah\u00edrs, graziers, 6938; Banj\u00e1ras, carriers, 1544; Cham\u00e1rs, skinners and leather sellers, 2105; Dhimars, fishermen, 6112; Gawalas, cowherds and graziers, 23,588; Kal\u00e1rs, spirit sellers, 6689; Koshtis, weavers, 2348; Kurmis, gardeners and cultivators, 9386; Lodhis, cultivators, 15,867; Loh\u00e1rs,\nblacksmiths, 4921; M\u00e1n\u00e1s, cultivators, 3741; M\u00e1r\u00e1rs, cultivators, 45,335; Mehr\u00e1, labourers and cultivators, 34,120; Nais, barbers, 3371; Ponw\u00e1rs, cultivators, 34,901; Son\u00e1rs, goldsmiths, 4060; Tel\u00eds, oil-pressers, 5916. Aboriginal tribes professing Hinduism, chiefly Gonds, 12,031. Of the non-Hindu aboriginal tribes, 96,488 in number, Gonds were returned at 88,688; Baigas, 7737; Kols, 27; and Kaw\u00e1rs, 36. Divided according to sect, the Muhammadans comprise\u2014Sunnis, 5868; Shi\u00e1s, 91; unspecified, 582. The 36 Christians consist of 10 Europeans or Eurasians, and 26 natives; 17 are returned as belonging to the Church of England, 5 as Roman Catholics, and the remainder unspecified. As regards the occupations of the people, the Census report classifies the male population in the following six main divisions:\u2014(1) Professional, including Government officials and the learned professions, 3327; (2) domestic servants, etc., 772; (3) commercial, including merchants, traders, carriers, etc., 1359; (4) agricultural and pastoral, including gardeners, etc., 88,853; (5) manufacturing, artisan, and other industrial classes, 19,998; (6) indefinite and non-productive, including labourers and children, 54,521.\n\nDivision into Town and Country.\u2014The population is entirely rural. Of the 1211 villages in the District in 1881, 551 contained less than two hundred inhabitants, 509 had from two to five hundred, 132 from five hundred to a thousand, 14 from one to two thousand, 3 from two to three thousand, and 2 from three to five thousand. The head-quarters town, which is the most populous place in the District, contains only 4136 inhabitants.\n\nAgriculture.\u2014Of the total area of 3146 square miles, only 577 were cultivated in 1881-82, and of the portion lying waste, 731 were returned as cultivable; 4627 acres, or about 7 square miles, were irrigated entirely by private enterprise. The Government assessment is at the rate of 11d. per acre on the cultivated land, or 5d. on the cultivable land. The most important crop is rice, the area under the different crops being returned as under:\u2014Rice, 273,941 acres; wheat, 17,643; other food grains, 115,183; oil-seeds, 33,114; sugar cane, 2455; tobacco, 1105; and vegetables, 1204 acres. Average out-turn of crops per acre:\u2014Rice, 572 lbs.; wheat, 470 lbs.; inferior grains, 480 lbs.; oil-seeds, 242 lbs.; fibres, 325; crude sugar, 356 lbs.; tobacco, 214 lbs. Average rates of rent for land growing cereal crops, from 10d. to 1s. an acre. The price of rice averages about 4s. 6d. a cwt. The tenants number over 20,000, of whom about 4400 have either absolute or occupancy rights, the remainder being tenants-at-will. Average wages per diem\u2014skilled labour, 1s.; unskilled, 3d. Of the purely agricultural classes the most numerous are the Lodh\u00eds and Ponw\u00e1rs. Both are esteemed to be good cultivators, though the latter have merely a local reputation, while the former are well known throughout northern\nand central India. From the immigration of sturdy peasants of these classes the reclamation of the forest wastes may be hoped for; and it was with the main object of facilitating their settlement in B\u00e1lagh\u00e1t that the District was at first experimentally formed. For the last ten years, every effort has been made to induce industrious husbandmen to reclaim lands in the upland tracts. Where the plot applied for has been entirely waste, grants have been made under the waste-land clearance lease rules. Where a few squatters have already settled, active men are encouraged to undertake the management of the village, by the prospect of obtaining the proprietary right on their getting the village inhabited and the lands around brought under cultivation. In the year 1882, the total area of grants made amounted to 95,653 acres.\n\nCommerce and Trade.\u2014The trading classes chiefly consist of oil-sellers and spirit-distillers, who, however, combine other trades, and even agriculture, with their hereditary vocations. The artisan class as yet scarcely exists. Gold is washed in a few of the streams, especially the Deo and the Son (Soane), but the quantity obtained hardly repays the labour. At Malanjhand in the Bhiml\u00e1t taluk, malachite is found in thin flakes. Abandoned workings have been discovered so old, that there is no tradition of their ever having been worked. In many places on the hills iron abounds. The Gonds smelt the ore into rough semi-circular shapes of about 10 lbs. weight, called chul\u00e1s, which are sold in the b\u00e1z\u00e1rs for from 6d. to 1s. a piece. The mica is too fragmentary to be of much value. What little internal trade there is in B\u00e1lagh\u00e1t is carried on with the villages of the Waingang\u00e1 plain. There the inhabitants of the uplands find a market for their produce, and thence they obtain their salt, their copper vessels, their cotton goods, and their hardware. The greatest obstacle to the prosperity of the District arises from the difficulty of communication. Only within the last few years has much progress been made in this respect. During that period the the Panch\u00e9ra, the War\u00e1i, the B\u00e1npur, and the Bhondw\u00e1 hill tracts have been rendered available for carts; but in 1881 the length of made roads was returned at only 116 miles of the 2nd class. There is no railway in the District. Communication by water is carried on by means of the B\u00e1gh, the Deo, the Son, and the Waingang\u00e1 rivers, on which, during the flood season, a good deal of grain goes down, and some salt comes up in flat-bottomed boats. But the navigation of these streams is much impeded by the rocky barriers which occur in different parts of their course, in the removal of which, however, some progress has been made.\n\nAdministration.\u2014In 1867, B\u00e1lagh\u00e1t was, as a temporary measure in the first instance, formed into a separate District under the Government of the Central Provinces, and attached to the N\u00e1gpur Division. It is administered by a Deputy-Commissioner, with an Assistant Commis-\nsioner and tahsildars. In 1881-82, the total revenue amounted to \u00a332,094, of which the land revenue yielded \u00a316,179; total cost of District officials and police of all kinds, \u00a37138; number of civil and revenue judges of all sorts within the District, 5; magistrates, 4; maximum distance from any village to the nearest court, 65 miles; average distance, 30. The police force of the District in 1881-82 consisted of a regular force of 222 men, and a town police of 11 men, costing \u00a33418, of which \u00a33304 was payable by the State. The daily average number of prisoners in jail in 1881 was 79\u00b721, of whom 9\u00b754 were females. The number of Government or aided schools under Government inspection in 1881-82 was 36, attended by 1882 pupils. This is exclusive of private unaided schools. The Census Report of 1881 returned 2306 boys and 16 girls as under instruction, besides 2698 males and 35 females as able to read and write, but not under instruction. The District contained four municipalities in 1881-82, viz. Burh\u00e1, W\u00e1ra Seoni, Lalb\u00e1ra, and Katang\u00ed, with an aggregate population of 12,422. Municipal income, \u00a3893; expenditure, \u00a3562.\n\nMedical Aspects.\u2014The rainy season lasts from June to September. In 1881, the rainfall at the civil station amounted to 62\u00b751 inches; in 1876 it was 56\u00b720 inches. The average rainfall during the ten years ending 1881 was 65\u00b765 inches. Temperature in the shade in 1881\u2014May, highest reading 113\u00b0 F., lowest 80\u00b0; July, highest reading 90\u00b0, lowest 73\u00b0; December, highest reading 83\u00b0, lowest 79\u00b0. By far the most fatal complaint is fever, to which cause is attributed about 83 per cent. of the deaths throughout the District. Cholera and small-pox have been comparatively harmless, but dysentery and similar bowel complaints are responsible for a considerable number of deaths. In 1881, the registered death-rate per 1000 of the population was returned at 22\u00b74. The District has three dispensaries, namely the B\u00e1lagh\u00e1t main dispensary, with branches at W\u00e1raseoni, Hatta Behir, and Katangi. [For further particulars regarding B\u00e1lagh\u00e1t District, see the Gazetteer of the Central Provinces, by Charles Grant, Esq., C.S.I., pp. 15-23: Nagpur 1870; Census Report for the Central Provinces, 1881; and Administration Report for Central Provinces, 1881-82.]\n\nB\u00e1l\u00e1hera.\u2014Village with fort in Jaipur (Jeypore) State, R\u00e1jput\u00e1na; on the route from Agra to Ajmere, 78 miles west of the former, 150 east of the latter. Lat. 26\u00b0 57' N., long. 76\u00b0 47' E. Situated close to a pass through a chain of rocky hills running north and south. The fort was bombarded and partly destroyed by De Boigne, Sindhia\u2019s general, in the end of last century.\n\nBalahi.\u2014Hill range in Bhand\u00e1ra District, Central Provinces; 6 miles west of Bhand\u00e1ra, rising 400 feet above the plain. Lat. 21\u00b0 10' 30\" to 21\u00b0 13' N., long. 79\u00b0 35' 30\" to 79\u00b0 38' 15\" E.; area about 24 miles in circumference.\nB\u00e1lakot.\u2014Town in Haz\u00e1ra District, Punjab; situated on left bank of the river Kunhar or Nains\u00fakh, 20 miles in a straight line from the junction with the Jhelum (Jehlam). The population in 1881 was 2310 in the main village, besides 7018 in scattered hamlets included in the village (mauz\u00e1). A few Khattris of this place, in conjunction with those of Naushahra (Nawashahra), have a considerable trade. Imports, salt, cloth, indigo, and cotton; chief export, clarified butter (gh\u00ed). Of the agricultural population, belonging to the Sw\u00e1ti and G\u00fajar tribes, a majority inhabit the central village; the remainder, included in the above figures, are scattered in isolated hamlets over the extensive lands of the township.\n\nB\u00e1lakot.\u2014Fortified village in the hilly region of Damoh District, Central Provinces; 12 miles south-west of Damoh. Lat. 23\u00b0 41\u2032 45\u2033 N., long. 79\u00b0 22\u2032 45\u2033 E. The inhabitants are Lodh\u00eds, and rebelled in 1857, when the fort was dismantled by the British troops. Police post.\n\nB\u00e1lamau.\u2014Pargan\u00e1 in Sand\u00edla tahs\u00edl, Hardoi District, Oudh; bounded on the north by Gopamau, on the east and south by Sand\u00edla, and on the west by Bangar and Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n pargan\u00e1s, the Sai river marking the boundary line. The pargan\u00e1 is said to have been formed towards the end of Akbar\u2019s reign by one Bal\u00e1i K\u00farm\u00ed, who, flying from the oppression of the Chandels some 300 years ago, found an asylum with the Kachhw\u00e1ha Kshattriyas of Marhi. Being settled by them in the neighbouring forest, he cleared and peopled it, and founded the village of Bal\u00e1i Khera, now B\u00e1lamau. Another tradition states that Bal\u00e1i K\u00farm\u00ed received the jungle tract from the Kachhw\u00e1has as a reward for his assistance in beating off a Musalm\u00e1n raid. A small and fertile pargan\u00e1, with an area of 25 square miles, of which 18 are cultivated. Principal crops, wheat, barley, and gram. Land revenue, \u00a32048, at the rate of 3s. 6\u00bed. per cultivated acre, or 2s. 7\u00bed. per acre of total area. Population (1881) 11,720. Of the fourteen villages comprising the pargan\u00e1, 8 are held by Kachhw\u00e1ha Kshattriyas, 2 by Nikhumbhs, 2 by Suk\u00fal Br\u00e1hmans, and 1 each by K\u00e1yasths and Kashm\u00edri Br\u00e1hmans.\n\nB\u00e1lamau.\u2014Town in Hardoi District, Oudh; 14 miles north-west of Sand\u00edla. Population (1881) 2461, principally agricultural K\u00farm\u00eds; 313 houses. A thriving place, with daily market and Government school.\n\nB\u00e1lapur.\u2014T\u00e1luk in Akola District, Ber\u00e1r. Area, 570 square miles; contains 3 towns and 165 villages. Population (1881) 107,200, comprising 55,739 males and 51,461 females, or 188\u00b707 persons per square mile. Area occupied by cultivators, 282,930 acres.\n\nB\u00e1lapur.\u2014Town in Akola District, Ber\u00e1r. Lat. 20\u00b0 40\u2032 N., long. 76\u00b0 49\u2032 15\u2033 E.; 16 miles west of Akola town, and 6 miles south of P\u00e1ras station on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway; population (1881)\n11,244, of whom 5994 were returned as Hindus, including many Guzerati Br\u00e1hmans, and 4642 as Musalm\u00e1ns. The M\u00fan river divides B\u00e1lapur proper from the petta (suburbs). Contains a library, a charitable dispensary, two schools\u2014one a girls\u2019\u2014police station, and post-office. B\u00e1lapur was the chief military station of the Mughal rulers of Ber\u00e1r after Ellichpur. One of the largest fairs in Ber\u00e1r was formerly held here in honour of the goddess B\u00e1l\u00e1, whose temple still remains, and who gives her name to the town. B\u00e1lapur is mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari as one of the richest pargan\u00e1s of Ber\u00e1r. Az\u00edm Sh\u00e1h, son of Aurangzeb, is said to have resided here, and to have built a fort of earthwork. Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk defeated (July 1721) the imperial forces close to the town, after a severe engagement, in which his famous Deccan artillery decided the day. The present fort of B\u00e1lapur is the largest and probably the strongest in Ber\u00e1r, the hill forts of Melgh\u00e1t excepted. An inscription on the front gate states that it was completed in 1757 by Ism\u00e1il Kh\u00e1n, first Naw\u00e1b of Ellichpur.\n\nThe Jam\u00e1 Masjid, once a fine building, 90 feet long, but now a ruin, bears date 1032 A.H. A chhatr\u00ed (umbrella-shaped pavilion) of black stone, 25 feet square and 38 feet high, on the bank of the river, south of the town, is much admired. It is supposed to have been built by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Sav\u00e1i Jai Singh, who accompanied Alamg\u00edr to the Deccan (Dakshin). A good market on Saturdays; the woven manufactures, formerly in high repute, are now but little sought after. A large proportion of the inhabitants are Musalm\u00e1ns, and the town is generally becoming a ruin.\n\nB\u00e1lar\u00e1mpur.\u2014Town or collection of villages in Kuch Beh\u00e1r State, Bengal. Population (1881) 10,696, namely, males 5526, and females 5170.\n\nB\u00e1l\u00e1san.\u2014A river of D\u00e1rj\u00edling District, Bengal; rises at Jagat Lepch\u00e1, a few miles south-west of D\u00e1rjiling, and flows south until it enters the tar\u00e1i, where it divides into two streams. One, called the New B\u00e1l\u00e1san, branches off and joins the Mah\u00e1nad\u00ed on its right bank just below Siligur\u00ed; the other, the Old B\u00e1l\u00e1san, continues its southward course till it passes out of the tar\u00e1i into Purniah District. The B\u00e1l\u00e1san is fordable at several places during the cold and dry weather, and even in the rainy season after flood water has subsided. In the hills the banks of the river are covered with jungle, but in the tar\u00e1i they are cultivated.\n\nB\u00e1l\u00e1sinor (V\u00e1ddsinor or W\u00e1r\u00e1sinor).\u2014Native State within the Political Agency of Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha, in the Province of Guzerat, Bombay Presidency, lying between 22\u00b0 53' and 23\u00b0 17' N. lat., and between 73\u00b0 17' and 73\u00b0 40' E. long.; bounded on the north by the States of the M\u00e1hi K\u00e1ntha, on the east by the State of L\u00fanaw\u00e1ra, and part of the Godhr\u00e1 Sub-division of the P\u00e1nch Mahals, and on the west and south\nby the Kaira District. The territory is about 30 miles in length and 10 to 12 in breadth, and is divided into two distinct and nearly equal parts, the B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor and Virpur Sub-divisions, the former containing 41 villages, the latter 57, much mixed with those of the adjoining State of L\u00fan\u00e1w\u00e1ra; estimated area, 189 square miles; population (1881) 46,328, or an average of 245 per square mile; of the total population 23,969 are males, and 22,359 females; estimated gross revenue, \u00a311,000. Except some hilly tracts in the west, the surface is flat. The soil is fertile, and though fever prevails, the climate is tolerably healthy. There are no rivers of any note except the M\u00e1hi; irrigation is conducted from wells. Products\u2014cereals, oil-seeds, pulses, sugar-cane, and cotton. Routes from Guzer\u00e1t to M\u00e1lwa pass through the State, and transit duties are levied. There are 2 schools, with 496 pupils. The chief is a Musalm\u00e1n. The distinguishing title of the family is B\u00e1bi, meaning \u2018doorkeeper,\u2019 that having been the office assigned to the first ancestor, who attained distinction at the Mughal court. The chief has power to try his own subjects for capital offences, without requiring the sanction of the Political Agent. He pays a tribute of \u00a3360 to the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r of Baroda, and \u00a31108 to the British Government. He maintains a military force of 203 men, and is entitled to a salute of nine guns. Succession follows the rule of primogeniture; there is no sanad authorizing adoption. The family traces its origin to Sher Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1bi, a distinguished officer in the imperial service (A.D. 1664); the fifth in descent, Sal\u00e1bat Kh\u00e1n, was granted the revenues and jurisdiction of B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor and Virpur. Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n, the fourth in descent from Sal\u00e1bat Kh\u00e1n, obtained possession of the principality of Jun\u00e1garh in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r; on his death his territory was divided, the younger son receiving Jun\u00e1garh, and the elder son continuing to hold B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor. During the ascendancy of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in Guzer\u00e1t, the State became tributary to both the Peshw\u00e1 (1768) and the G\u00e1ekw\u00e1r; and in 1818, when the British Government succeeded to the rights of the Peshw\u00e1, it assumed the political superintendence of B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor. Placed at first under the supervision of the Collector of Kaira, B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor has, since the year 1853, formed part of the territory controlled by the Political Agent of Rew\u00e1 K\u00e1ntha.\n\nB\u00e1l\u00e1sinor.\u2014Chief town of B\u00e1l\u00e1sinor State, Guzer\u00e1t, Bombay Presidency; near the Sheri river, on the route from N\u00edmach (Neemuch) to Baroda.
