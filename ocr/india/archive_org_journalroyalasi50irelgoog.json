W. Redhouse, M.R.A.S., Hon. Mem. R.S.L., etc.\n\nAll students of the facts and doctrines of Isl\u0101m, that uncompromising and purely monotheistic faith promulgated by Muhammad to the pagan Arabians, his kinsmen or countrymen, as also to the Arabic-speaking Jews and Christians who dwelt in and about Mad\u012bna, or the three Arabias, thirteen hundred years ago, will have met with some mention of what European writers generally know as \"The ninety-nine names of God,\" but which are denominated in chap. vii. v. 179, as also in chap. xx. v. 7, of the Qur'\u0101n itself, \"The Most Comely Names,\" \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0633\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0629\u064e \u0623\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0633\u064e\u0646\u064e.\n\nIn the first of these passages it is said: \u0648\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0633\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0629\u064e \u0623\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0633\u064e\u0646\u064e \u064a\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u0628\u0650\u0647\u064e\u0627, and unto God belong the most comely names; call ye, then, upon Him by them; and in the second: \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0647\u064f \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0633\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0629\u064e \u0623\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0633\u064e\u0646\u064e \u0647\u064f\u0648\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u064f \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0633\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0629\u064e \u0623\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0633\u064e\u0646\u064e God is He, save whom there is no God; unto Him belong the most comely names.\n\nThe European expression, \"the ninety-nine names of God,\" is not, as we see, in accordance with the Qur'\u0101nic designation, \"the most comely names,\" which specifies no definite number whatever. Lane, however, informs us in his Lexicon, voce \u0623\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0633\u064e\u0646\u064e, rad. \u062d\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0646\u064e, that the commentary on the Qur'\u0101n\nTHE MOST COMELY NAMES.\n\nentitled \"Exposition by the two (writers named) Jal\u0101l,\" adds to its mention of this expression: \"the most comely names,\" the remark: \"which are ninety and nine in number.\" The specific number \"ninety-nine\" is not, then, of European invention in this matter.\n\nMeninski, again, voce \u0623\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u060c has: \"\u0623\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 the names of God, otherwise \u0623\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u062f\u0651\u0645\u0627\u062a the names of the qualities, said to be ninety-nine in number, etc., are the divine attributes, repeated by pious Muslims as they tell their beads. Hottinger, in his Historia Orientalis, gives the list of them in alphabetical order.\" This last statement as to an \"alphabetical order\" does not appear, however, to be correct; for \u0623\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 is said by Meninski to be Hottinger's 82nd attribute, and \u0623\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u062f\u0651\u0645\u0627\u062a to be the 94th, \u0623\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u062f\u0651\u0645\u0627\u062a being the 23rd. I do not see any alphabetical order in these words and numbers, even in respect of the roots; and so of the rest.\n\nAt p. 203 of Vol. VI. New Series, of the Society's Journal, begins a chapter in the article, by Lord Stanley of Alderley, on the \"Poetry of Mohamed Rabadan.\" This chapter is in Spanish verses of four lines each; and every verse is surmounted by an invocation in Arabic, \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u064a\u0627 \u0623\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0627 O God! \u0631\u0628\u0651 \u064a\u0627 \u0623\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0627 O Lord! etc., to the number of ninety-nine, as may be counted.\n\nAt p. 129 of the part of our Journal which has recently been distributed, being Part I. Vol. XI. New Series, begins an article by E. T. Rogers, Esq., M.R.A.S.: \"On Arabic Amulets and Mottoes.\" On the next page\u2014p. 123\u2014and third paragraph, Mr. Rogers says: \"I find in the square compartments the hundred attributes of God.\" Here is a slight departure from the stereotyped expression \"ninety-nine names.\"\n\nThrough the kindness of the late Colonel Guthrie, I was some years ago enabled to take a copy of a list of \"the\n\n1 The list has only ninety-nine names or titles when correctly counted.\u2014J. W. R.\nninety-nine names of God\" from a work by Herklot. I also copied a very considerable number of such \"names,\" not found in Herklot's list, from an old Latin work by Peter Kirsten Vratislas, printed A.D. 1609, and belonging likewise to Colonel Guthrie.\n\nThese, and Hottinger's, ex Meninski, I have since compared with the lists given by Mohamed Rabadan and Mr. Rogers. The result was that, instead of ninety-nine, I found upwards of two hundred and fifty such names; some, it is true, being compounds. By subsequent search in the Qur'an itself, the number has been increased to over five hundred, with great capability of almost indefinite extension, even to a thousand.\u00b9\n\nMost of these words, which are, in fact, epithets or titles of the Deity, were originally culled from the Qur'an. They are there found in esse, or in posse. But a few are of later introduction, speculative and philosophical, or mystical. Mohamed Rabadan's words, being all preceded by the interjection \u0644\u064e, are grammatically incapable of taking the definite article \u0644\u064e before them, with the exception of \u0644\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064f, generally treated, in such case, as a simple word, to the exclusion of all consideration for its initial article. On the contrary, Mr. Rogers's list gives all the words with the definite article before them.\n\nBoth systems are correct; that of the Spanish Moor absolutely so; that of Mr. Rogers, or rather of the amulet from\n\n\u00b9 The correctness of each \"name\" is attested by the total of the numerical values of its component letters.\n\n\u00b2 In a work printed in 1842-7 for the Society for the Publication of Oriental Texts\u2014viz., the Biographical Dictionary by Al-Nawawi, in p. 28, l. 18, I find it mentioned as follows:\n\nSome of the Sufi sect have asserted: \"Unto God, may He be glorified and magnified, (belong) a thousand names.\" One line further on there occurs:\n\nBut as to the names of God, may He be glorified and magnified, well, this number is insignificant in respect of them. Of course, the Divine Titles are, in reality, co-extensive with language. But it is to be feared that \"the ninety-nine names of God\" will long remain in the public mind as a relic of past belief.\nwhich he has copied them, admissibly so. Some of them occur in the Qur\u2019an with the definite article; some are there used indefinitely; others are made definite by a definite complement; some remain indefinite with indefinite complements; and some are found definite in one passage, indefinite in another. When made definite, as in the amulet, the words assume a special sense, attributing to God, par excellence, the quality of which they are themselves, for the most part, the adjectives, epithets, or titles. It is hardly correct for us to call them the \u201cnames\u201d of God, though a few are, in effect, nouns substantive. But even these, as all the rest, may be considered nouns adjective; even those which, like \u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0629\u064c \u0645\u0650\u0651\u0646\u0652 \u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0627\u062a\u0650\u0647\u064e\u0627, consist of several words forming a phrase; as may be seen by a study of the list.\n\nOn referring to the Qur\u2019an for the words and phrases so given, I have ascertained that some are found in the lists which do not occur in that volume, even inferentially; and I have also collected many, mentioned there, which are not included in any one of the lists. Ninety-nine out of two hundred and fifty, or more than five hundred, necessarily implies a selection. I have no doubt that my list, as given below, in alphabetical order, has omitted some\u2014nay, many\u2014of the Divine Titles (as I prefer to style them), that a more thorough search would find or infer in the Scripture of Islam.\n\nHowever that may be, one thing becomes abundantly clear through this collation of the various lists with one another, and with the sacred book; namely: It is quite erroneous to use the phrase \u201cThe ninety-nine names of God.\u201d Each list of ninety-nine of them is a selection, varying according to the religious fancy or preference of some eminent man, who perhaps took those which occur most frequently, or in passages more generally read, or more usually recited in the celebration of the prescribed duty of divine worship, or in the mystical rites of the numerous orders of Dervishes. Such list should, therefore, be entitled, as the Muslims sometimes,\nif not always, do style it: *A Chaplet of (ninety-nine) Divine Titles*, or, more fully: *\u0633\u064f\u0645\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629\u064c \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0623\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0621\u0650 \u0623\u064e\u0643\u0652\u062b\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629\u064d*.\n\nThe reason for the selection of the number ninety-nine, in relation to these Divine Titles, is that the chaplet or rosary used by Muslims in their daily devotions, contains ninety-nine beads, divided into three sections of thirty-three each. The greater chaplets of the Dervish orders contain nine hundred and ninety-nine. Possibly, nine hundred and ninety is the true number\u2014ten times that of the ordinary chaplet. They are spoken of as containing a thousand; even, a thousand and one.\n\nWhy these numbers, ninety-nine and thirty-three, were originally chosen, I cannot say. But, after the completion of a performance of the prescribed, obligatory divine worship, a kind of voluntary doxology is recited, in three parts. In the first of these, the ejaculation: *I recite the doxology of God, \u0633\u064f\u0645\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629\u064c \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0623\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0621\u0650 \u0623\u064e\u0643\u0652\u062b\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629\u064d*, is repeated thirty-three times; then the ejaculation: *Glory belongeth unto God, \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0670\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652 \u064a\u064e\u0628\u0652\u0644\u064f\u0648\u064f\u0651\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652*; and finally, that of: *God is Most Great, \u0623\u064e\u0643\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0631\u064f\u0647\u064f\u0645\u0652*. These ejaculations should not, strictly, be counted at all; but they may, permissively, be told on the fingers; and the beads are more convenient, as insuring accuracy. Thus it is that the chaplet, the rosary, is made up of ninety-nine beads, in their three equal divisions.\n\nBut the three ejaculations, though together recited ninety-nine times, do not form ninety-nine \"names of God.\" They do not, by their very nature, enter into any list of ninety-nine, or other number, of such names or Divine Titles.\n\nHowever, the chaplet of beads, the rosary, having been introduced to use at the celebration of the divine service of Islam, it is not to be wondered at that religious fervour, stimulated in many ways, in endless climes, among various\n\n---\n\n1 The thirty-three perhaps originated in counting three each on the joints of the ten fingers, and one triplet added, to make sure. The ninety-nine is simply a multiple of this basis.\nnations, by the stirring events of its pristine days, should have adapted it to new forms of pious use. Especially, since it was a frequent practice with the very earliest Muslims, as among the hermits and monks of the various Christian sects then abounding in Syria, Egypt, and Ethiopia, to indulge in protracted services of voluntary, supererogatory praise, both in private and in public worship. Prayer to God on common occasions, by individuals, was from the first discountenanced or forbidden by Muhammad, under the very rational pleas that God best knows what is good for His creatures, and that man's first duty is to know and confess his \"One Lord God,\" bowing in cheerful, loving, grateful submission to the just, merciful, and benevolent decrees of His divine will. It is, therefore, quite erroneous to style the divine worship of Isl\u0101m the performance of prayers. Prayers it is not. It is praise, worship, service alone, in the prescribed, incumbent divine ritual of Isl\u0101m.\n\nIt is, furthermore, eminently erroneous and unjust, as well as equally inconsequent and inconsistent, for professing Christians, writers and speakers, to cast upon Muslims, their scriptures, and their prophet, the unfounded accusation of fatalism. That is a pagan idea, with which Isl\u0101m has no more in common than Christianity has. What Muhammad taught, what the Qur\u02be\u0101n so eloquently and so persistently sets forth, and what real faithful Muslims believe, conformably with what is contained in the Gospels and accepted by devout Christians, is, that God's Providence pre-ordains, as His Omniscience foreknows, all events, and overrules the designs of men, to the sure fulfilment of His all-wise purposes. There is, in fact, no difference whatever in the fundamental ethics of Christianity and Isl\u0101m, however irreconcilably divergent they may be on a few, very few, but very important, vital points of detail, dogmatic belief, and religious polity. Muhammad did not profess to preach a new religion, but to\nrestore the one and only possible old faith in God and a future state to its original simplicity and purity, as delivered to the patriarchs and prophets in succession, of whom he himself was to be the last.\n\nThe early Mualims, in Muhammad's own time, of their own accord, were used to assemble in the first mosque at Madina,\u2014it was then a mere \u1e0dyop\u00e1, a place of assembly, for public deliberation, as well as for worship,\u2014and there to continue in the assiduous performance, not only of the stated services, but also of voluntary worship. When the sacred month of fasting by day, Ramadh\u00e1n (Ramaz\u00e1n), came round, these assemblies became more protracted, and the special long night-service, termed Tar\u00edwi\u00e1, was by them invented. Muhammad, hearing of this novelty, went on three successive nights to these meetings, or remained after the prescribed night-service. After that, he refrained from attending them; fearing, as he is reported to have said: \"lest the performance thereof be revealed in scripture as incumbent on you.\" He could not, however, object to them; for the Qur'\u00e1n, xxii. 41, gives the injunction on which they are based:\n\nO ye who have believed, commemorate ye God with an abundant mention, and doxologize ye Him morning and evening.\n\nThe custom has continued as the universal practice of the Muslim world, orthodox, heretical, or schismatic, to this day. The Tar\u00edwi\u00e1 (Tersvth), the long, supererogatory night-services of Ramadh\u00e1n, are known to all acquainted with the usual life of Isl\u00e1m in all parts of the world.\n\nThe word Tar\u00edwi\u00e1, \u062a\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0648\u0652\u064a\u0650\u062c\u064f, is a plural noun, of which the singular is Tar\u00edwi\u00e1, \u062a\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0648\u0652\u064a\u0650\u062c\u064c. This means: an act of taking breath and rest. The application of the plural word as the name of these special long night-services of Ramadh\u00e1n,\narose from the circumstance that rest and breathing-time were taken at stated intervals during the celebration.\n\nThe whole service of the Tar\u0101w\u012bh consists of twenty Rak'a, \u0631\u0643\u0639\u0629, performed in five acts or parts of four Rak'a each, with an interval, for rest and breathing, between each two acts, of as long a duration as the performance of the \"act\" itself requires.\n\nA Rak'a may be considered as a single scene, in the theatrical sense of this last word. Rak'a means, lexically: a single act of bowing one's self down,\u2014of bending the head, neck, back, and hip-joints, until the back acquires a horizontal position. Technically, it is a term of ritual, and means: a single section, sub-act, or scene of worship, including various postures of standing, bowing, sitting, kneeling, and prostration, with all the recitations uttered, aloud or in a subdued tone, during the performance of those various evolutions and their concomitant gestures.\n\nAn \"act\" of worship, a \"service,\" \u0633\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0629 (in Persian and Turkish \u0633\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0647), is sometimes made up of two such sections or scenes, sometimes of three, sometimes of four; all obligatory, all prescribed. Five such acts of worship,\u2014five such \"services,\"\u2014are incumbent daily on every Muslim, male or female, of legal age and right mind, when not prevented from their performance by certain accidents.\n\nCustomary \"scenes\" of worship are appended to those which are obligatory in some \"acts\"; and customary acts are performed by the devout between the obligatory \"acts,\" in imitation of what Muhammad was in the habit of doing. Those which are obligatory are called \u0641\u0631\u0636, and the customary ones \u0633\u0646\u0629. Besides these, voluntary scenes, and voluntary acts, of worship, termed \u0641\u0631\u0627\u0626\u0636, are of frequent or habitual practice by the devout, of their own free will, with next to no limit.\n\nThe long Tar\u0101w\u012bh night-service of Ramadhan is of the \"customary\" kind, not being \"obligatory.\" The interval\nof rest that follows each of its five \"sections\" may be filled up, at the option of each worshipper, either by actually sitting still and silent,\u2014really resting,\u2014or by performing a voluntary act of worship, or by a recitation from holy writ, or by offering prayers from the approved collects, or by reciting doxologies, In public worship this last is the one more generally practised; or rather a combination of the last two or three. A collect, or a portion of scripture, a lesson, or both, forms a sort of preface, in succession, to each of the three ejaculations of the doxology, which is repeated thirty-three times by each worshipper, in a sort of chorus, the precentor (there are no priests in Islam), the \"Imam,\" leading and guiding. From practice he has no real occasion to count how many times he repeats each. He chants the holy words in a beautifully modulated measure, into which the thirty-three repetitions accurately fit. The less carefully trained devotee may have recourse to his finger-joints for the tale; but the chaplet, the rosary, insures against mistakes, and is in general use.\n\nThe chaplet of ninety-nine beads, the rosary, would appear to have been next put to a use that, though forming no part of the ritual of divine worship, brought those beads into still greater veneration.\n\nThat text of the Qur'an, before quoted, which commands Muslims to \"commemorate God with an abundant mention,\" was combined, in some one's mind, with that other which enjoins their calling upon Him by His \"most comely names.\" A series of ninety-nine of these was consequently drawn up, perhaps for private devotion at first, committed to memory as a list in a certain established order, and then recited, in that order, as a special meritorious exercise of voluntary praise, the tale being checked by the beads of the chaplet.\n\nOther devotees would observe that many of the \"most\ncomely names\" found in the Qur'an were wanting in this first list; or the original compiler may have prepared various lists for use on different occasions, but always consisting of the same number, nine and ninety. When two complete lists of that number of simple \"most comely names\" had thus been compiled, and a desire, or a need, was felt to make up a third or a fourth, etc., it would be found that there were not enough. Recourse would then be had to the compounds so frequent throughout the sacred volume. Meanwhile, poets and other writers had been at work, and had invented many a divine title not actually found in the Qur'an, but legitimately inferable from verbs or nouns contained therein. These would be adopted into the multiplying lists arranged for the special service of this or that body of devotees, and the use of the chaplet gained ground ever more and more. The greater dervish chaplet was also introduced.\n\nIt will have been remarked that, in the passage of the Qur'an above quoted, where the Muslims are commanded to commemorate God abundantly, they are also enjoined to doxologize Him morning and evening. The word here rendered by the coined term \"doxologize,\" \u064a\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064f\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0627, is the imperative verb plural of which the verbal noun is \u064a\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064f\u0631\u064f. This literally signifies an act of doxologizing, i.e. an act of reciting as a hymn of praise, either a single ascription of glory often repeated, or a string of ascriptions once proffered each. From thus indicating the \"act of doxologizing,\" the word \u064a\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064f\u0631\u064f was next applied to the doxology itself. It is used twice in the Qur'an, once in the former sense, and once in the latter.\n\n\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064f\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0627 \u0628\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064f\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0627 \u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0643\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0644\u064e\u0627 \u064a\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062d\u064f\u0631\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e\n\nThere is not anything, but that it doxologizes with His glory: i.e. However, understand not their doxologizing!\u2014Qur. vii. 44.\n\n1 Kahl says: \"their celebration thereof.\"\nEach hath known His service and His doxology. \u2014Qur. xxiv. 41.\n\nBut the application went further. The chaplet itself; the rosary, came to be designated by this same word, \u062a\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0628\u0650\u064a\u062d\u064e\u0629\u064c, this verbal noun; at least, so it is called in Persian and in Turkish.\n\nThe Persian lexicon named Farhangi Jahangiri, \u0641\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0646\u0652\u06af\u0650\u06cc \u062c\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627\u0646\u06af\u0650\u06cc\u0631\u06cc, voce \u062a\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0628\u0650\u064a\u062d\u064e\u0629\u064c, says in explanation: \u062a\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0628\u0650\u064a\u062d\u064e\u0629\u064c \u06a9\u064e\u06c1\u064f\u0648\u064e \u0628\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0633\u064e\u0631\u0650\u06cc; i.e. Head-knot, a knot which they make up on the head of a rosary; and this the corresponding Turco-Persian lexicon renders by: \u062a\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0628\u0650\u064a\u062d\u064e\u0629\u064c \u06a9\u064e\u06c1\u064f\u0648\u064e \u0628\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0633\u064e\u0631\u0650\u06cc; it is the knot and tie at the place where the stems are to be put on to rosaries.\n\nAgain, the Persian lexicon entitled Bahari-Ajam, \u0628\u064e\u0647\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650\u06cc \u0639\u064e\u062c\u0645, gives the terms \u062a\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0628\u0650\u064a\u062d\u064e\u0629\u064c \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0628\u0650\u064a\u062d\u064e\u0629\u064c, as being the names of two particular kinds of chaplets, to the first of which a poet, Ta'sir, has likened his own tears:\n\n\u06af\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0651\u06cc\u0647 \u0622\u0645 \u062f\u064e\u0631\u0650 \u0627\u064e\u0633\u0652\u062a\u0650\u06cc\u0652\u0646\u0650 \u062a\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0628\u0650\u064a\u062d\u064e\u0647\u0650 \u062c\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0645\u0650 \u06a9\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0633\u064e\u062a\u0652\n\u0646\u064e\u0627 \u06af\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0627\u062f\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0633\u0650 \u0634\u064e\u0627\u062e\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0627 \u0646\u064e\u0633\u064e\u062a\u0652 \u0628\u064e\u0631\u0650 \u062f\u064e\u0627\u0645\u064e\u0645\u0650 \u0632\u064e\u062f\u0645\n\nMy tears on my sleeve are (as) a rosary of beads, (red) like the eyes of nightingales. Why! what branch (of a rosebush) have I (ever) laid hand on the skirt of (in entreaty)?\n\nThis meaning of chaplet, rosary, does not appear, however, to be given in Arabic to the word \u062a\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0628\u0650\u064a\u062d\u064e\u0629\u064c; for \u0633\u064e\u062c\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0629\u064c is the only name recorded in the best lexicons, and in Lane. In Freytag we find \u0633\u064e\u062c\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0629\u064c given also, from the Arabian Nights; and Bocthor mentions it as well.\n\n1 Sale has: \"His prayer and His praise.\"\nTHE MOST COMELY NAMES.\n\nThe very large chaplets sometimes used by Dervishes in special rites, public or private, are exaggerated in general use, though they are doubtless used by devotees in keeping tale of their long-protracted commemorations.\" These Dervish rites are no legitimate part of Islam, any more than those of Freemasonry are a part of Christianity. Those rites are viewed with dislike by the strictly orthodox, as savouring more or less of schism, heresy, and blasphemy. They are tolerated, however, nay, even patronized by high and low, as theologically justifiable, and undoubtedly fashionable, manifestations of a sanctimonious zeal and ostentatious devotion, much in the same way with our own Ritualists, Odd-fellows, and the like.\n\nI now proceed to give an alphabetical list of all the \"most comely names\" or divine titles, simple and compound, that I have met with. I explain their significations, show which are verbally, and which are inferentially Qur'anic, indicating the passages where they occur, and the list or lists from which they are taken.1 Those among them which point to a divine attribute that pertains to grace and mercy are known as the names of Grace, \u0623\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0621\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062c\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650; and those that betoken an attribute leaning to the exhibition of stern justice and severity are designated the names of Majesty, \u0623\u064e\u0633\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0621\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0645\u0650.\n\n1. \u0623\u064e\u062d\u064e\u062f\u064f One. Q. cxii. 1; H. 2; V. 1; R. 96; Rs. 91. (See also Nos. 13, 65.)\n\nOccurs more than fifty times in Q., but once only as a title of God: \u0623\u064e\u062d\u064e\u062f\u064f \u0647\u0648\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064f \u0623\u064e\u062d\u064e\u062f\u064f He is one God; or rather, with greater emphasis: He is the God, a sole one.\n\n2. \u0623\u064e\u062d\u064e\u0628\u064f\u0651 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0628\u064e\u064a\u0650\u0651\u0646\u064e\u0627\u062a\u0650 the Most Beautiful of Creators (i.e. the Creator whose works are the most beautiful and the most\n\n---\n\n1 In this list, the following abbreviations are used.

Q. xi. 47; xcv. 8. (See No. 87.) M. gives this, but not as a title of God.\n\n4. \u0623\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627\u062e\u0652\u0631\u064f the Last. Q. lvii. 3; Ht. 73; V. 2; R. 98; Rs. 38. (See No. 46.)\n\nOccurs thirty-eight times in Q., but as a divine title in this passage only; \"the last day,\" \u0623\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627\u062e\u0652\u0631\u064f, being the subject of all the others.\n\n5. \u0623\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0631\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0645\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0623\u064e\u0631\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0645\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e the Most Compassionate of those who feel compassion. Q. viii. 150; xii. 64, 92; xxi. 83; V. 3. (See No. 161.)\n\nMentioned in the list given by V. only; as are most of the complex titles, if given at all. M. notices the expression. The singular \u0623\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0631\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0645\u064f is not in Q., nor in any list.\n\n6. \u0623\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064f \u0645\u064f\u0628\u064e\u0634\u0650\u0651\u0631\u064b\u0627 the Swiftest in devising stratagems. Q. x. 22. (See Nos. 238 and 402.)\n\n7. \u0623\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0645\u064f the One who knows best. Q. vi. 124; xi. 33. (See Nos. 8, 299, 308.)\n\nEvery one conversant with Muslim sayings and writings is well aware of the frequent expression: \u0623\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0645\u064f, but God knows best, used as an admission of uncertainty in the speaker or writer as to the truth or correctness of something narrated. In colloquial Ottoman Turkish, \u0623\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0645\u064f is a frequently used expletive, in the sense of our: I think, I opine. M. gives it.\n\n8. \u0623\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0644\u0650\u0645\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0623\u064e\u0643\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0645\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e the Most knowing as to the thankful.

(See Nos. 169, 303.)\n\nOccurs five times, also applied to other things than God.\n10. *the Most Great.* (See Nos. 337, 415.)\n\nThe word is found in twenty-three passages of Q., but not once as a divine title. This is remarkable. The ejaculation \"God is Most Great,\" used in battle, and in the call to worship, the 'Adh\u0101n ('Az\u0101n), is so prominent in the history of Isl\u0101m, and is one of the three clauses of the doxology recited with the chaplet, more especially in the Tar\u0101w\u012bh night-service of Ramadhan. It is in none of the lists.\n\n11. *the Worshipped One.* Lane. (Usually written *g.v.*, and *g.v.*.) The form is used by the poet N\u0101higa Dhiby\u0101ni (Idyl 16, v. 6; Derenbourg), prior to Mu\u1e25ammad.\n\n12. *the God* (the Worshipped, the Worshipful One). Q. passim; H. 1; Ht. 1; Rs. 1. (See Nos. 11, 13\u201440.)\n\nOccurs several hundreds of times in Q., and is said in Qs. to be the word of majesty, further reported, also, by Jurj\u0101ni, to be the Great Name, and the name of the divine substance (essence, or person), whereas all others are titles only, based on qualities, or attributes. This word is also used, frequently, by N\u0101higa Dhiby\u0101ni. It is said to have been modified from *g.v.*\n\n13. *the God, one.* Q. cxii. 1. (See also Nos. 1 and 12.)\n\nThis is the Isl\u0101mic, Qur'anic enunciation of God's unity, in contradistinction to all syntheism, the duality of the Magians, the trinity of the Christians, and the polytheism of the pagans.\n\n14. *God, the Most Beautiful of Creators.* Q. xxiii. 14.

It is as follows (ii. 256):\n\nI render the passage in the following manner, with some variations from Sale\u2019s version:\n\nGod, save whom there is no God, is the Living, the Self-existing One. Dronziness overcometh Him not, nor sleep. Unto Him belongeth whatever is in the heavens, and whatever is in the earth. Who is he that shall make intercession with Him, save by his permission? He knoweth whatever is before them, and whatever is behind them; and they comprehend not a single matter of His knowledge, save only that which He hath willed. His firmament spans the heavens and the earth, the preservation whereof doth not distress Him. And He is the Most High, the Most Supreme.\n\nThe \u0622\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0651, of Nos. 17, 29, etc., is explained by scientific commentators to signify the \u201cHeaven of Heavens,\u201d i.e. the \u201cprimum mobile\u201d of the old astronomers, the \u201cempyrean\u201d of poets; and the \u0622\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0651 of the present passage to indicate the \u201cstarry vault,\u201d i.e. the \u201cfirmament\u201d or \u201cheaven of the fixed stars.\u201d These two \u201cheavens\u201d were supposed to be above the \u201cseven heavens,\u201d \u0622\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0651 of the \u201cseven planets,\u201d \u0622\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0651, which were, in order, from below upwards: 1st, the Moon, \u0622\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0651; 2nd, Mercury, \u0639\u064f\u0642\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0651; 3rd, Venus, \u0622\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0651; 4th, the Sun, \u0622\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0651; 5th, Mars, \u0622\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0651; 6th, Jupiter, \u0622\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0651; and 7th, Saturn, \u0632\u064f\u062d\u0644\u064c. They thus\nconstituted, in all, nine \"heavens,\" being the eighth, and the ninth or highest, beyond which God holds His state in unapproachable, inconceivable grandeur, majesty, and splendour.\n\nThe words and are both explained as meaning a \"throne;\" but, as one throne is not placed on another, and as is several times mentioned in Q. as the most intimately approximate dwelling-place of God's glory, we may better look upon this as the representative of His \"throne,\" and then would become \"His footstool.\" Or, if the latter be taken for the \"throne,\" then the former may be understood to figure the \"pavilion,\" tent, tabernacle, or roof, over the throne. But, in this case, the divine glory would be considered as residing beneath the \"roof\" and above the \"throne;\" whereas it is always spoken of as being beyond. I therefore prefer to consider this latter as the \"throne,\" and as the \"footstool.\" Every \"stool\" is, in fact, denominated , though a \"chair,\" a \"bedstead,\" and a \"throne\" are so called also.\n\n111. the Living, the Manifest One.

Q. i. 2; ii. 158, etc.; V. 53.

Several reasons have been adduced for this omission, the most probable being that a part of it was the very last promulgated, and that Muhammad died before he had assigned a distinct place to it, thus leaving it doubtful whether it was a chapter by itself, or a part of one. However, the formula is repeated whenever a recitation of any section of the Qur'\u00e2n is about to be entered upon, and also before commencing any action of importance.\n\n216. \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0631\u064e\u062d\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0646\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064f\u0633\u062a\u064e\u0639\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064f the Compassionate One, He who is invoked for aid.

V. 59.\n\nApplied in Qs. in this sense to a man. In Q. xix. 19 it is said of a boy; applied to whom it also signifies: growing, thriving.

(See No. 236.)\n\n234. \u0633\u064e\u062c\u064e\u062f\u0652\u062a\u064f (I recite) the doxology (of God). V. 61.\n\nThis word, used only in the accusative definite, and always followed by a noun in the genitive, or by a possessive pronoun singular of the second or third person, indicative of God, occurs forty-one times in Q., and is constantly used as a doxology, in the form \u0633\u064e\u062c\u064e\u062f\u0652\u062a\u064f (recite thou, or, I recite) the doxology of the God, or \u0633\u064e\u062c\u064e\u062f\u0652\u062a\u064f \u0631\u064e\u0628\u0650\u0651\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0644\u0650\u064a\u064f\u0651 (recite thou) the doxology of thy Lord, the Most High; the first of these two being also frequently heard as an exclamation of wonder or admiration. The word is never used as a divine name or title, and is always a doxology alone. To suppose that it is a \"name of God\" is a gross error. What has given rise to this false idea would appear to be a custom with writers, out of reverence, to suppress the name of God after the verb \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e He hath said, when they quote a passage of the Qur\u02be\u0101n, but to indicate the source of the quotation by interposing a doxology between it and the verb; thus: \u0642\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0633\u064e\u062c\u064e\u062f\u0652\u062a\u064f \u0648\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0645\u0652\u062a\u064f \u0625\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0670\u0647\u0650\u064a\u0652 \u0623\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627\u0652 He, whose praises I recite and whose glory\nbe extolled, hath said: \"I am God; there is no God save Me.\" In such cases a divine title may be introduced and the doxology also; thus: \n\u0642\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u064f \u0628\u0650\u062d\u064e\u0645\u0652\u062f\u0650\u0647\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e\u0649 God, whose praises I recite and whose glory be extolled, hath said. In like manner, when reporting a tradition of the prophet, his name or title is also suppressed at times, and mentioned at others, with the usual blessing on him in both cases; thus: \n\u0642\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0635\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u064f \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0647\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0645\u0652 or \n\u0642\u0627\u0644\u064e \u0627\u0644\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0628\u0650\u064a\u064f\u0651 \u0635\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u064f \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0647\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0645\u0652. It would be equally a great mistake to suppose that the salutation \u0635\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\u064f \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0647\u0650 \u0648\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0645\u0652 is a name or title of Muhammad.\n\n235. \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064e\u0651\u0628\u064f\u0648\u0631\u064f the Ever-lauded One (to whom, or of whom, the doxologies are recited).

R. 47.\n\nThe word, even its root, does not occur in Q., nor in any of the other lists. It is the title of the Prince of Makka. When indefinite, it is said of a descendant from Muhammad, through Fatima, like \u0627\u0644\u0633\u062f\u06cc\u0646\u06cc. At Makka, in contradistinction to \u0627\u0644\u0633\u062f\u06cc\u0646\u06cc, it is used to designate especially a descendant from Muhammad.\nthrough Hasan, the elder son of Fatima. As an ordinary adjective, it qualifies anything holy or honourable. Doubtless, God is holy and honourable, and this word may have been applied among His titles.\n\n261. \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064f\u0643\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0651\u0631\u064f the All-thankful One.

The translations for and , as well as the present title and that next following, by our words from \u201cpardon\u201d and \u201cforgiveness,\u201d are not sufficiently comprehensive to render the full meaning of the idea that forms the distinction between this class of titles and that derived from the root (see Nos. 296, 297, 298). For, while the title its verb and nouns, are fully represented by our derivatives from \u201cpardon\u201d and \u201cforgive,\u201d the class from contain the accessory idea of admitting the pardoned one into the joys of heaven as well. Like our idea of \u201cabsolve,\u201d simply remits the responsibility of an offence; but entails the further consequence of admitting to bliss and glory. This is why the words and are used of defunct Muslims in a sense similar to our \u201cblessed\u201d and \u201csainted,\u201d i.e. whose sins are blotted out, and who is admitted to a participation in the\nrewards of the righteous. Our word \"gracious,\" as applied to God in the sense of Granter of heavenly bliss, is far too broad, and also fails to include, explicitly, the idea of pardon. I cannot suggest a satisfactory term.

The terms *\u0627\u0644\u062a\u062f\u0628\u0631* and *\u0627\u0644\u062a\u062f\u0628\u0631\u0629*, quasi-synonyms of *\u0627\u0644\u062a\u062f\u0628\u0631* and *\u0627\u0644\u062a\u062f\u0628\u0631\u0629*, mean, the former, God's *decree*, the latter, one's *allotted portion*. Both may correctly be rendered by our term *dispensation*. True that astrologers, dervishes, and poets talk about *the sphere*, *\u0627\u0644\u062a\u062f\u0628\u0631*, as ruling or influencing sublunary events. To Islam, this is either rank paganism and blasphemy, or a special application of the admitted truism that here below God acts through secondary causes. As a name or title of God, V.'s *\u0627\u0644\u062a\u062f\u0628\u0631* is probably a mistranscription for *\u0627\u0644\u062a\u062f\u0628\u0631\u0629*, q.v.\n\nNo. 359. In European languages, the term \"Providence\" has become a metaphorical name of God; but in Islam, *\u0627\u0644\u062a\u062f\u0628\u0631* is not so used.\n\n372. **the Most Holy One.** Q. lix. 23; lxii. 1; H. 86; Ht. 5; R. 6; Rs. 5.

This is in direct opposition to the general rule in those two languages, by which the final \\textit{\u064a\u064f} of such words as \\textit{\u0623\u064e\u0645\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u064a\u064f\u0651}, is retained, and they are always written \\textit{\u0645\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u064a\u064f\u0651}, etc., when, in Arabic, indefinitely, they would become \\textit{\u0645\u064e\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u064a\u064f\u0651}, etc.\n\n413. \\textit{\u0623\u064e\u0645\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0639\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u064a\u064f\u0651} the High-exalted One.

II.\u2014Notes on a newly-discovered Clay Cylinder of Cyrus the Great. By Major-General Sir H. C. Rawlinson, K.C.B., President and Director of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nThe Society was informed in the Report which was read at the Anniversary Meeting in May, and which has since been printed in the Journal, that many new Inscriptions had recently been discovered in Babylonia by Mr. Hormuzd Rassam. When that gentleman lately returned to England from Mesopotamia, he left working parties both at Babylon and Nineveh, and it is from the excavations of the former place that the British Museum has recently received the very interesting relic which I am now about to describe. This relic, which is a broken clay cylinder of Cyrus the Great, 9 inches long, with a diameter of 3\u00bd inches at the end and 4\u00bd in the middle, was deposited apparently by the king in one of the temples of Merodach at Babylon, shortly after his conquest of the city, a conquest which is well known to form the climax of one of the most brilliant episodes in the history of Herodotus, and which has long been rendered famous throughout the Christian and Jewish worlds by its immediate connexion with the feast of Belshazzar, as described by Daniel the Prophet. The Cylinder is unfortunately too much broken to admit of a complete or connected translation being made of the text, which originally extended to forty-five long lines of very minute writing, and there are besides many words and phrases in the inscription of doubtful import; but still some passages are fortunately preserved which are of the greatest historical value, and altogether the Cylinder is perhaps the most interesting Cuneiform document that has been yet discovered. The opening of the inscription is entirely lost, and for the\nfirst half dozen lines a few words only can be recovered, which would seem, however, to show that a king was then in power, in Babylonia (from after-notices we find him to be Nabu-nahid\u2014the Nabonidus of the Greeks), who, although he took measures for the temporal security of the province, and strengthened Ur and the other fortified cities, neglected the temples and tampered with the ceremonial worship. The rites of Merodach, \u201cking of the gods,\u201d were apparently superseded by the worship of inferior deities. Through his neglect the defences became dilapidated. \u201cAt this desecration the Lord of the Gods (presumably Merodach) was deeply grieved, and all the Gods inhabiting the temples of Babylon deserted their shrines. In the festivals (or processions), which were held at Cal-anna (which I shall presently show was the core of Babylon), Merodach and his kindred gods (were no longer seen)? They had removed to other congregations which had retained places for them; then the people of Sumir and Akkad (the usual designation for the country population of Babylonia proper as distinguished from the townsmen), who had been left in darkness?, prayed to Merodach to return (to his old\n\n1 A great deal has been written on the subject of the Sumir and Akkad, the presumption universally being that the names indicated an ethnical distinction among the primitive inhabitants of Babylonia. My own view, however, has always been that the names merely applied to the \u201cfixed inhabitants\u201d and the \u201cNomades,\u201d or, which is the same thing, to the Lowlanders and Highlanders without any necessary distinction of nationality. , which joined to emi or lissum \u201ca race,\u201d denotes the Sumir, certainly means \u201ca fixed abode,\u201d sumtu; while the double , which is the Akkad monogram, is equated with hurri (Hurri), \u201cmountains,\u201d the inhabitants of which along the Babylonian frontier are, and always have been, \u201cNomadic.\u201d Akkad for Ankud is the same word as the Arabic Najd. I may add that a similar distinction between \u201chill\u201d and \u201cplain\u201d also occurs in the Inscriptions under the form of Arman va Padan, sometimes corrupted to Padan va Allman (see B.M.I. vol. ii. pl. 38, L. 40), the compound title being a mere transcription of the Padan Aram of the Bible. The original Turanian title of Kingi-Burbur must have meant etymologically \u201cPlain\u201d and \u201cHill,\u201d rather than \u201cfixed\u201d and \u201cnomade,\u201d but subsequently the titles seem to have been used indifferently. It is quite possible that in Sumir-emir we may have the original of the Greek Sipparus, used eponymously like Ninus, Medus, Perseus, Armenus, etc., and referring to the fixed population both of Assyria and Babylonia.\nhaunts); he granted their prayer, returned and rejoiced the land, selecting a king, who, according to his wishes, might govern the people, whom he committed to his charge. So he proclaimed the name of Cyrus, king of the city of Ansan, to be king over the whole country, and to all people he declared his title. The country of Guti and all its forces, whom he caused to bow before his feet, as well as the whole nation of the black-heads, whom he brought into his hand, he made to rest in security and order (?). Merodach, the great lord, the feeder of his people, in his double capacity (?), directed his heart and hand and caused him to live (or worship ?) joyfully. To his own city of Babylon he summoned him to march, and he caused him to take the road to Dindir (one of the popular names for Babylon); like a friend and benefactor (?) he conducted his army. His far-extending forces, of which, like the waters of the river, the numbers could not be told, and their precious swords were the pride of his army; (?) without fighting or opposition he brought them near Cal-anna, and his city of Babylon he surrounded and conquered. Nabonidus, the king who did not worship him, he delivered into the hand of Cyrus. Then the people of Dindir, all of them and many of the Sumirs and Akkads, nobles and high priests, revolted and refused to kiss his feet (i.e. Nabonidus's); they rejoiced in his (i.e. Cyrus's) sovereignty and changed their allegiance. The god in whose service the dead are raised to life, and who helps all in difficulty and want (?), thoroughly befriended him and blazoned forth his proclamation (as follows): I am Cyrus, the supreme (?) king, the great king, the powerful king, king of Dindir, king of Sumir and Akkad, king of the four races; son of Cambyses, the great king, king of the city of Ansan; grandson of Cyrus, the great king, king of the city of Ansan; great-grandson of Teispes, the great king, king of the city of Ansan. The ancient royal family, of which Bel and Nebo had sustained the rule in the goodness of their hearts, faded away when I entered victoriously into Dindir. With joy and gladness in the royal palace I established the seat of sovereignty. Merodach, the great lord,\nthe heart of his follower which the sons of Dindir and... (this passage is mutilated and the sense cannot be recovered).\n\nMy wide-spreading army was peacefully established throughout Dindir and the many districts of Sumir and Akkad, their good order was not disturbed (?). The high places of Babylon and all its fortresses I maintained in good preservation. The sons of Dindir had neglected to repair their dilapidations (?). Their fissures gaped, their walls bulged out. To the work of repairing his shrine, Merodach, the great lord, addressed himself (?). To me Cyrus the king, his worshipping, and to Cambyses my son, the offspring of my heart, and to my faithful army (the god) auspiciously granted his favour (?), so that we succeeded in restoring (the shrine) to its former perfect state (?) (all very doubtful). Many of the kings dwelling in high places, who belonged to the various races inhabiting the country between the Upper Sea (or Mediterranean) and the Lower Sea (or Persian Gulf), together with the kings of Syria and the unknown regions beyond (Sutaru, a word otherwise unknown) (?), brought to me their full tribute at Cal-anna, and kissed my feet. (They came) from... as far as the cities of Assur and Istar, from Agate, Isnunuk, the cities of Zamban, Mie-Turnu, and Duran, as far as the skirts of Guti, and the fortresses along the banks of the Tigris, where they had been settled from ancient times. The gods who dwelt among them to their places I restored, and I assigned them a permanent habitation. All their people I assembled, and I restored their congregations; and the gods of Sumir and Akkad, whom Nabonidus had inaugurated at the festivals (or processions) of the lord of the gods at Cal-anna, by command of Merodach, the great lord, I assigned them...\n\n1 The Tigris is here represented under its old Turanian form of \u1e62\u0101g\u0101r\u0101 Masuggar (as the name is phonetically spelt in a fragment recently discovered), which seems to have simply meant \"flowing as water,\" S\u0101g\u0101r\u0101; its Assyrian equivalent, answering to the Arabic \u1e62\u0101g\u0101r\u0101 Sibh. Idik was probably a Turanian root with the same meaning, to which was added the suffix in -\u0101, as in Turnu, Sagana, Arma, etc. A feminine ending then formed Idikat, which was corrupted into Idiklat, and ultimately Diqlat, the present name.\nan honourable seat in their sanctuaries, as was enjoyed by all the other gods in their own cities. And daily I prayed to Bel and Nebo that they would lengthen my days, and would increase my good fortune, and would repeat to Merodach, my lord, that, 'Thy worshipping Cyrus the king, and his son Cambyses . . . .'\n\nThere are ten more lines of inscription, which probably contain prayers, but the writing is too much mutilated to admit of any connected sense being made out; for the last six lines, indeed, a few isolated characters at the end of the lines are all that remain.\n\nIn discussing this inscription, the first point to which it seems desirable to draw attention is, that it finally settles the vexed question as to the genealogy of Cyrus the Great. It proves that he was descended in five generations from Ach\u00e6menes, the direct line of descent being: 1, Ach\u00e6menes; 2, Teispes; 3, Cyrus; 4, Cambyses; and 5, Cyrus, in exact accordance with the testimony of Herodotus, and in correction of Diodorus, who is supposed to have placed another Cambyses between Cyrus I. and Teispes, since he gives that name to the brother of a certain Atossa, who was ancestress in the fourth degree of Anaphes, one of the seven conspirators. The inscription further proves, in opposition to the opinion of Dr. Oppert, that the crown descended uninterruptedly from Ach\u00e6menes to Cyrus the Great, though it still leaves us in doubt how to explain the statement of Darius at Behistun, that \"eight of his ancestors had been kings before him in two lines, he himself being the ninth.\" Perhaps, however, Ariaramnes remained in Persis when his father Teispes pushed on to Ansan; and he and his son Arsames may thus have been kings in that province, though the next descendant, Hystaspes, lost all independent power on the rise of Cyrus the Great. At any rate, it is only by\n\n1 For the position of Cyrus in the family of the Ach\u00e6menides, see Rawlinson's Herodotus, vol. iv. p. 260. The only modification in the Professor's genealogical scheme which the recent discovery renders necessary is the elimination of Cambyses, son of Teispes, doubtfully introduced on the authority of Diodorus, see Phot. Bib. p. 1158.\n2 See Records of the Past, vol. vii. p. 87.\nCLAY CYLINDER OF CYRUS THE GREAT.\n\nsome special explanation of this sort that we can justify the statement of Darius. Pending further research, therefore, I propose to give the royal line in a double series, as follows:\n\n1. Ach\u00e6menes.\n2. Teispes.\n3. Cyrus.\n4. Cambyses.\n5. Cyrus the Great.\n6. Cambyses.\n7. Ariaramnes.\n8. Arsames.\n9. Darius.\n\nHystaspes, we know from Herodotus, was only a private individual (and, indeed, we find him in the Behistun Inscription acting in a subordinate capacity to his father as leader of the troops against the revolted Parthians), and although it may seem to militate against the royal position of Ariaramnes and Arsames that the title of king is not attached to their names at Behistun, the very same objection might be taken in regard to Teispes and Ach\u00e6menes, both of whom were, undoubtedly, independent monarchs.\n\nThe next point to consider is the more interesting and important question of the native country of the Persian race, from whence Cyrus invaded Babylonia. It has often been remarked by Assyrian students that when the name of Persia (Parsua or \u1f08\u03bd\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd) occurs in the inscriptions of Nineveh, the allusion seems to be to a Northern district of Media and not to the Southern region on the Persian Gulf; and we now further find that the Ach\u00e6menians before their Western conquests did not call themselves \"kings of Persia,\" but kings of the city of Ansan. The explanation which I now venture to give of this hitherto unknown name, is as follows. The name of a barbarous country to the east of Babylonia often occurs in the earlier Cuneiform documents, which is written \u1f08\u03bd\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd, and which\nCLAY CYLINDER OF CYRUS THE GREAT.\n\nhas been hitherto usually read as Anduan, but the second letter \u1e63\u1e63 has the power of sa as well as of du, and it is therefore equally permissible to read the name as Ansan. This same name of Ansan is again stated in a gloss (B.M.I. vol. ii. pl. 47, l. 18) to be pronounced Assan, the nasal, as usual, being assimilated with the following sibilant, and it is explained in the same passage by Elamtu \"Elymcan.\" That Ansan or Assan must be a part of Elam, or immediately adjoining that province, is further shown by the frequent junction of the name, especially in the astrological tablets, with Subartu, which was a well-known title for the portion of Susiana that adjoins the mountains. It is very curious then to find that, although, as far as I know, Greek and Roman authors are entirely silent as to any country or city of Ansan, or Assan, in Western Persia, there is a notice of \u1e62\u0101san in a very early and learned Arabic writer Ibn-el-Nadim, who had unusually good means of information as to genuine Persian traditions. This writer ascribes the invention of Persian writing to Jamshid, the son of Vivengan (who, with the Zoroastrians was the Eponym of the Persian race), and adds that he, Jamshid, dwelt at Ass\u00e1n, one of the districts of Tuster (modern Shuster)\u2014Kitab-al-Fihrist, p. 12, l. 22. From what Pehlevi source this information is derived I have no means of discovering; but I am strongly tempted to believe that the Elymcan Assan of the inscriptions, and the Shuster dependency of that name, are one and the same.\n\nWhere then are we to look for the site? In Smith's Primitive Geographical list (Biblical Arch\u00e6ol. Journal, volume i. page 87) Assan (or Anduan as there printed) comes between Erid (one of the earliest of Chaldean capitals, and represented by the modern ruins of Thib).\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 For a notice of the king of Assan and Subartu united, see B.M.I. vol. iii. pl. 60, lines 67 and 68.\n\n\u00b2 The name of the city of Erid is written phonetically in B.M.I. vol. iv. pl. 21, c.l. 2. 1. 49, as \ud808\ude17\ud808\ude17\ud808\ude17, i.e. Tisba, first and last characters being determinative and non-phonetic. Now Ti\u0161ba is repeatedly given as the Accadian form of Assyrian \ud808\udee9\ud808\udd36, dinne, Heb.\nand Markhasi, which would lead us to look for the site either in the valley of the Kerkha or of the Dezful River; but, on the other hand, a district so far to the west could hardly be called a dependency of Shuster. I should, indeed, have naturally looked for a locality immediately to the East of Shuster, in the direction of Persis, and should thus have selected the plain of Mal Amir (the Aidej of the Arabs) as the most suitable position for Assan, had not the inscriptions in that vicinity, at Kal-Faraun and Shikaf-i-Salman, afforded evidence of Turanian rather than Arian nationality. I am compelled, therefore, for the present, and pending further research, to place Assan somewhere in the plain of Ram-Hormuz, which, in deference perhaps to some old tradition, was a very favourite resort of the Sassanian kings, when the native race was again restored to power.\n\nSome explanations are now required regarding the country of Guti, which is twice mentioned in the Inscription of Cyrus. Gutu is found in one of the syllabaries as the Accadian equivalent of Garradu, \"a warrior,\" which we\n\n\\[ \\text{Arab. } \\text{\u062b\u0628} \\]\n\nThib, which is usually represented by the monogram\n\n\\[ \\text{good' or 'blessed,'} \\]\n\nas the name of the famous city of H\u00e9a, and primitive capital of Southern Babylonia is commonly written) is thus shown to be the same as the Thib of modern geography. This city, halfway between Susa and Wasit, still exhibits some very remarkable ruins, having been until recently the head-quarters of the Sabeans of Ir\u00e9k, and is known traditionally as the city of Seth. Many circumstances, indeed, combine to show that the legend of a terrestrial Paradise arose from this region, the triad of Anu, Bel, and Zebu answering to the Biblical Cain (the elder), Abel, and Seth, father of Enos or 'man.' But this difficult subject can hardly be treated in a casual note. A brief account of the ruins of Thib will be found in Layard's Khuzistan paper, Journ. Roy. Geog. Soc. vol. xvi. p. 69.\n\n1 Markhasi has a very Arian aspect, standing probably for Morakhabh or the Maqhabar of Ptolemy. The name also occurs in B.M.I. vol. ii. pl. 50, l. 66, and it was evidently, therefore, a place of some consequence.\n\n2 See the copies of these Elymais inscriptions in Layard's collection, published by the British Museum, pls. 31/32 and 38/37. Layard, in his paper on Khuzistan, mentions several other inscriptions in Elymais where Cuneiform Inscriptions are either known or believed to exist, yet of this grand historical collection we have only two short and badly copied specimens. What a field, then, does Elymais present for an enterprising archeologist!\n\n3 I have frequently in this paper used the word Accadian in the sense in which it is now generally employed to denote the leading Turanian dialect of ancient Babylonia; but it must not be supposed that I really attach any special ethnical value to the designation. According to my view the Akkad were mere highland Nomades, who used a great variety of dialects, principally, but not exclusively, Turanian.\nhave the authority of Strabo for taking to be the original form of the name of the Carduchi or Kurda. The Guti then were the warlike tribes who dwelt along the mountains overhanging Assyria and Babylonia, from Armenia to Susiana. They were the immediate neighbours of the Medes, and are thus repeatedly joined with them in the Inscriptions of Sargon. In all probability the subjugation of the Guti recorded by Cyrus before his descent upon Babylon included his conquest of the Medes. I may further notice that Mount Nizir, upon which, according to the Chaldean account of the Deluge, the ark rested on the subsidence of the waters, is called Guti in the Inscriptions, and it retains the title of Mount Jidi, the regular Arabicized form of Guti, to the present day; the tradition, moreover, of the ark having rested there still attaching to the spot.\n\nA more difficult matter for inquiry is involved in the Accadian name for Guti, which seems to be \"the Post of the God Anu,\" referring probably to some myth of the early races connected with their notions of the Cosmogony.\n\nThe other names contained in the geographical list of the Cyrus Cylinder are all sufficiently well known. The city of Assur was the old capital at Kelah Shergat, while the city of Istar might be either Nineveh or Arbela, as the goddess had special shrines in both cities. As Nineveh, however, was in ruins in the time of Cyrus, I suppose the name to refer to Arbela, and infer from its mention\n\n1 For equivalence of Gutu and Gerradu, see Delitzsch's Assyr. Lex., p. 58, l. 20. As a title of Nergal, Gutu, Gut and Gerradu are used indifferently, B.M.I. vol. ii. pl. 64, l. 71; while (which was probably sounded Gut, the last letter being phonetic complement), when applied as an epithet to Merodach, is also translated by Gerradu, B.M.I. vol. iv. pl. 20, lines 7 and 8. The same element occurs in the Accadian name of Gutibir, applying to Merodach, B.M.I. vol. ii. pl. 48, l. 36.\n\n2 This name is written B.M.I. vol. ii. pl. 48, col. 3, l. 14, or with for the second letter in B.M.I. vol. ii. pl. 50, l. 52, the first element being explained, both in a gloss to this latter passage and in Syllabary No. 399, by Gis-gul \"the big wood,\" which is translated in Assyrian by Manze \"set up,\" as a post (?). I do not pretend to explain the mythic origin of the name, but I was certainly wrong in connecting it with the Su-enma of Babylon, as I am quoted by Mr. Norris in his Dictionary, p. 205.\nthat the Lycus was the boundary of the province to the north at the time of the conquest. The other cities also were probably all frontier positions, quoted in evidence of the limits of Babylonia proper in the time of Cyrus. Thus Agat\u00e9 or Agad\u00e9 (for Agani, as the name used to be read)\u00b9 was the western limit towards the desert; Isnunmak\u00b2 the limit to the south; Zamban\u00b3 was under the eastern hills, probably about B\u00e1-daraya; Mie-Turnu\u2074 at the mouth of the Tornadotus or Adheim; and Duran,\u2075 probably at Dur-ar-R\u00e1sib, modern Douravirj, on the Susian frontier.\n\nThe most difficult portion of the Cyrus Inscription, however, is that which relates to the worship of the Babylonian gods, the difficulty arising, not merely from the fragmentary character of the record and the doubtful reading of several of the most important passages, but also from the very loose and confused sacred nomenclature which prevailed at Babylon, owing to the amalgamation apparently in one Pantheon of several independent mythological systems. There would seem in remote antiquity to have been a double and probably a rival worship at Babylon, of the \"King\n\n\u00b9 I proposed the reading of Agoni for this city more than twenty years ago (see Rawlinson's Herod. vol. i. p. 611), comparing the *Ampardos* of Abydans and Akra-de-Agama of the Sanhedrim; and the reading was acquiesced in until recently, when Mr. G. Smith announced that he had discovered the true name to be Agad\u00e9. Mr. Smith may possibly be right, as the letter \u1f08\u0393\u0394\u0395 more frequently represents \u1f08 than \u03bc; but I have never yet seen any proof of the new reading. The site cannot have been at the mouth of the Nahor Merid, where there is a large island still called Akur-el-Adem (for Agadam). As any rate, the name does not represent the Chaldee \u05d0\u05d2\u05b7\u05d3\u05b0\u05d0, \"a lake or marsh,\" nor is it, I think, the original of the \u05d0\u05d2\u05b7\u05d3 of Genesis.\n\n\u00b2 Isnunmak, meaning \"the house of the Ocean,\" was the name of the region bordering on the Persian Gulf. Smith always gives the reading of Mullius, apparently from an erroneous view of the passage in B. M. I. vol. ii. pl. 39, l. 59. The name has been considerably corrupted, and was probably replaced in Assyrian by Meran; B. M. I. vol. iii. pl. 47, lines 16 and 17.\n\n\u00b3 Zamban may be compared with the Sambana of Diodorus, which occurs on Alexander's march from Susa to Media; 1. Carrha or Kerch; 2. Sambana; 3. Celone or Ghildan; and 4. Bagistane or Behistan. The province along the outer skirts of the hills was afterwards called Mah Sabad\u00e1n, or the country of the Sambatae.\n\n\u2074 The Turanian name of this city is very remarkable from its connexion with Ninveh (the shrine of the fish), and will some day form a curious subject of inquiry. It reads Haatu-ma-na-stanu-lus-sida-pir.\n\n\u2075 Duran is a doubtful reading; Smith suggests Duban, but on no sufficient authority. The city is well known in Cuneiform Geography.\nof the Gods of Heaven and Earth,\" and of the \"Lord of the World.\" The former was afterwards confounded with the Anu of the Semites, and the latter with Bel or Ilu. They had each their special shrines, Anu at the Tul-illu or \"holy mound,\" represented by the present ruins of Amr\u00e1n; the other at Bar-sigyar, the great mound to the north, which is now called Babil (Mr. Rich's Mujellibeh). These rival places of worship divided the year, Bar-sigyar presiding over the first half, and Tul-illu over the second. Later on, two great temples were raised at these sacred spots, Bel's shrine being named Bit-Saggal, \"the lofty-headed,\" and Anu's Bit-Zida, \"the living house.\" At the \"holy-mound\" also was erected the great pyramid, which is called in the Bible \"the Tower of Babel,\" and which was destroyed under miraculous circumstances, the local legend regarding the destruction being apparently very similar to that preserved in Genesis. Subsequently another tower, or Ziggurat, was erected on the same mound, which was called \"the platform of heaven and earth,\" and which was the loftiest building in Babylon. Upon the mound were also found (besides smaller shrines or oratories) a papakh or \"chapel,\" dedicated to Nudu, a building called \"the shrine of the fish\" or \"fish-tail,\" and a high place or sanctuary (Parak) sacred to Marduk. Overlooking the holy mound was the palace of the kings, represented by the present ruins of the Ka\u1e63r; on\n\n---\n\nI have been advised by all Assyriologists that the standard epithet of the supreme God, as the builder of the Temples of Bit-Saggal and Bit-Zida, must be more than a mere record of architectural labours. Thus Mr. Rawlinson, who also as \"Defender of the Military and Civil Institutions of the country,\" monument, still more daring, suggested that the two Temples were the homes of the two Homespun. I myself believe that the distinction was religious, and implies a common Protectorate of the two rival sects of the country; and may be held that, according to my view there was a third sect, the followers of ( ), to which the monotheistic Hebrews of Ur belonged. This god, who is still locally known by the name of H\u00e9a, which I invented for him when I was first called \"God No. 1\" by his especial votaries. He was the Creator of mankind, \"the God of life and knowledge,\" \"the Lord of the Heavenly city\" or Paradise,\" and exhibits many other traces of identity with the Elohim of the Jews. There seems, indeed, to be an allusion to this deity being accepted by the Monotheists as the one true God, in the last verse of chapter vii of Genesis, where, as I understand the passage, it is said that \"about a thousand years ago (i.e., Seth, the Lord of THIS) began to be called by the name of H\u00e9a.\"\nthe skirts of the mound were \"the hanging gardens,\" and\nthe whole group of buildings, inclosed by an inner wall,\nformed a sort of separate town, which was named Cal-anna\nor \"the might of Anu.\" This name has hitherto been read Su-anna, or in Assyrian Emuk-Anu,\n\"the hand or might of Anu;\" and it is with some diffidence\nthat I now venture to propose for it the reading of Cal-anna\nor Calneh. My argument, however, is simply as follows:\nCalneh, or Calno, is mentioned in Genesis, in Isaiah, and\nin Amos, and was certainly one of the best-known names\nin Babylonia, yet there is positively no Cuneiform title but\nin the whole range of Babylonian geography which can be brought into possible assimilation\nwith . Of course, if there were any direct authority\nfor giving the phonetic value of kal to , the identification\nwould be undoubted, but hitherto I have never met with\nany such variant power in the Cuneiform glosses or syllabaries. An explanation, however, which occurs to me of\nthe orthographical difficulty is that the root kal signifies\n\"power\" or \"to be able\" in Accadian (compare kalga, \"having power\" or \"powerful\"), and that this\nis also the tropical meaning of \"the hand,\" which is\nusually rendered in Assyrian by emuk. Cal-anna would\nthus be an Accadian reading for \"might of Anu,\" as\nwould be \"might of Ashur,\" and Kalw\u00e1da, or\n, \"might of M\u00edd,\" and perhaps in the orthography\nof Calno employed in Isaiah x. 9, we might see an\nattempt to give the Semitic form of An\u00fa, instead of the\nAccadian reading of Anna. But the authority with which\nI conclude my argument, and upon which I mainly rely,\nis found in the Septuagint translation of the passage in\nIsaiah, where the Alexandrian Jews of the second century\nB.C., with a knowledge of the localities, render the verse\n\n---\n\n1 I have arrived at this appreciation of the various buildings at Babylon by a\ncareful comparison of the inscriptions of Nebuchadnezzar one with the other.\nThe only novelty in my view is that I maintain the Bit-Zida of the bricks, etc.,\nto be An\u00fa's temple at the Tui-ilu or \"Holy mound,\" and to have nothing to do\nwith the provincial temple of Bit-Zida at Borsippa, which was sacred to Nebo.\n\nVOL. XII.\u2014[NEW SERIES.]\nwhich reads in Hebrew, \"Is not Calno as Carchemish?\" by \"Have not I taken the region above Babylon and Calno (Kallawey) where the tower was built?\" Now the tower was built on the \"holy mound,\" and therefore which inclosed \"the holy mound,\" is Kallawey, or \u1e24a\u1e63\u1e63\u0101.\n\nIt will be observed that throughout the Inscription of Cyrus, Merodach takes the leading place, and this is nothing more than was to be expected under the circumstances, as this god in the later Babylonian period had appropriated to himself the functions, and even the name of the older national divinity, the title of Bel (Accadian \"Mullil\") being used in the Nebuchadnezzar Inscriptions, and also in this document, as a mere royal epithet of Merodach. It is probable, too, that the legend of Cyrus was drawn up by the priests of Merodach, and deposited in the temple of their god. That Cyrus himself had really exchanged the worship of Auramazda for that of Merodach is not for a moment to be believed, but with his large experience of Asiatic creeds he was no doubt tolerant in the extreme, and it was this tolerance we may believe that led him to look with equal favour on the Monotheistic Jews and on the Polytheists of Babylon; while the marked contrast between the refined dualism of the Persians and the gross idolatry of the Babylonians may account for the earnest admiration of the captive Israelites towards\n\n1 I am quite aware that in the present state of our Assyrian knowledge this proposed identification of \u1e2aa\u1e63\u1e63\u0101 with Calneh cannot be critically sustained. All the direct evidence that we possess tends to show that \u1e2aa\u1e63\u1e63\u0101 must, in the name in question, stand for emuk \"power,\" or \"the hand.\"\u2014comp. H.M.I. vol. iv. pl. 18, lines 18 and 19, where the reading is given of Emuki sirati as Anu for the name of a temple of Merodach at Babylon, and B.M.I. vol. iv. pl. 2, l. 12, 13, where \u1e2aa\u1e63\u1e63\u0101 is translated emuka as sasa, \"holy power.\" But, on the other hand, our information on the subject is as yet limited, and it is quite possible we may some day find \u1e2aa\u1e63\u1e63\u0101 among the equivalents of \u1e2aa\u1e63\u1e63\u0101. At any rate, the Temple of Emuki sirati as Anu, referred to by Smith (Discoveries, p. 232) is quite a different place from \u1e2aa\u1e63\u1e63\u0101, and has not necessarily the same pronunciation.\ntheir great deliverer. It would seem almost as if the writer on the Cylinder had known the words of Isaiah, and had transferred them to the god of his own religion. There is at any rate a marked similarity between some of the Hebrew phrases, such as \"I have called thee by thy name,\" \"I will go before thee and make the crooked places straight,\" and the expressions used on the Cylinder to describe Merodach's favour for Cyrus.\n\nI have not been able to ascertain the exact spot where this Cylinder was found. It is understood at the British Museum to come from the excavations at Birs Nimrud, but I can hardly believe this to be possible, as there is no allusion to Borsippa or to its temple in the whole extent of the Inscription; I should rather judge from the context that it must have been deposited in the lesser shrine of Merodach on the \"holy mound,\" which, as I have before said, is represented by the ruins about the tomb of Amr\u00e1n, and I may add that Merodach appears to have been worshipped at this shrine in his special character of \"the preserver of life\" (\"raising the dead to life,\" according to the language of the Inscriptions), a curious illustration of which is offered by the notice of Arrian, that in Alexander's last illness, as he was dying in the palace (\"the Kaor\"), prayers were offered up throughout the night to Jupiter Serapis in the adjoining temple to prolong the great conqueror's life.\n\nP.S.\u2014Since these notes were in type, I have observed that Professor Sayce (Journ. Bib. Arch\u00e6ol. vol. iii. p. 475) has already proposed to identify the Assyrian Inscriptions with a certain Anzana, which he claims to have found in the Inscriptions of Susa and Elymais, as the native name of those countries, the common title of the Susian king being, according to this reading, \"Lord of the empire of Anzan.\" Now I have failed to verify Mr. Sayce's quotations, except in one in-\n\n1 See, amongst other passages, B.M.I. vol. iv. pl. 19, lines 10 and 11.\nstance (Layard's Inscriptions, pl. 36, l. 12), and what is more, I see that Oppert ignores any such name as Anzan among the territorial epithets of the kings of Susa (Records of the Past, vol. vii. p. 79), but I am bound to say that I think Sayce's explanation very probable; and that I am inclined, therefore, now to revert to my original idea of placing the Achaemenian capital of Anzan in the plain of Mal-amir. It is, of course, quite possible that the Arian Persians may have crossed the mountains from Isfahan as early as the time of Achaemenes, driving out the Turanian Elym\u00e6ans, and holding the rich country on the Upper Kar\u00fcn, for a hundred years before they prosecuted their conquests to the westward, but in that case it is almost certain that they would have left some memorial of their sojourn in the shape of sculptures or inscriptions; and it becomes, therefore, of special interest that the rocks in the vicinity of Mal-amir should be thoroughly examined, with a view of detecting among the Elym\u00e6an antiquities any trace of Persian workmanship. Sir H. Layard and the Baron de Bod\u00e9 are the only travellers who have as yet published a notice of these antiquities from personal observation, but it is probable that the country will shortly be thrown open to engineers and even to tourists, in connexion with the projected railway from Isfahan to Shuster.\u00b9\n\nText of the Inscription on Cyrus Cylinder in Roman Characters with Interlinear Translation.\n\n1. . . . . . . . . . . . nisu\n\n2. . . . . . . . . . . . ipr\u00e1t\n\n\u00b9 The first six names in Ptolemy's Catalogue of the Cities of Persis evidently refer to this region between Shuster and Isfahan. 1.

The rich and ancient temples, as it is well known, of this region excited the cupidity of the Syrian and Parthian monarchs, and Antiochus the Great lost his life in an attempt to plunder them.\nCLAY CYLINDER OF CYRUS THE GREAT.\n\n3. rabbat\u00fa issakna ana dannutu matisu\n   a fortress (?) he established for the strengthening of his country\n\n4. si sili \u00fasaskina tsirusun\n   (officers?) he caused to be appointed over them:\n\n5. tamsili Bit Saggal ite\n   like the temple of Saggal he built (?)\n   in ana Hur va \u0161itt\u00e1ti makhaza\n   to the city of Ur and the rest of the strong places\n\n6. paraz la sim\u00e1tisunu\n   their ordinary dilapidations (?)\n   yomi samma iddini ibbub va krin\n   daily (?) he adjudged, he destroyed (?) and he\n\n7. vadduku usubdili ula\n   the rites he cancelled\n   kan kirib makhazi palakha Marduk sar ili\n   in the strong cities a worshipper of Merodach king of the Gods\n   se asusu (?)\n\n8. limutti irsu du ibbus yomi\n   in evil his city made daily\n   isu ina ab\u00e9ani la tabsut salkh\u00fat\u00ed \u00fakhallikhu kullats\u00edn\n   in affairs not being (?) the defences languished all of them,\n   (i.e. while nothing was doing),\n\n9. ana tazimti-sina Bel ili izzis iggug\n   at their destruction the Lord of the Gods exceedingly grieved\n   ki\u015fursun ili asib libbi sunu izibu admansun\n   their palaces (?); the Gods dwelling within them left their shrines;\n\n10. ina uggati sa \u00faseribi ana kirib Kal-Anna Marduk\n    in the sacred feasts which he celebrated within Cal-Anna Merodach\n    li sakhra ana napkhar dadmi sa innadu\n    (was not seen ?) he had migrated to other congregations who had removed (?)\n    subatsun\n    their seats\n11. va nisi mat Sumiri va Akkadi sa im\u00fa salamtas\nand the men of the countries of Sumir and Akkad who were in darkness\n\u00fasa . . . irka . . .

Remark dannutu for dannuti; the grammar of\nthe inscriptions shows marks of carelessness throughout.\n\nLine 6. paraz \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 'a breach or fissure,' is a well-known\nword, but it is curious to see it joined with a plural form\nla sim\u00e1ti. Smith (Assurbanipal, p. 330, note to p. 45) says\nthat sim\u00e1ti means 'anything fabricated,' the root being \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97,\nbut I prefer comparing the Arabic \u0633\u0650\u0645\u064e\u0651\u0627 and \u0633\u0650\u0645\u064e\u0651\u0627 sim\u00e1 and l\u00e1\nnot special' or 'ordinary.' The latter is very obscure: iddini would seem to be from Hebrew \u05d9\u05b4\u05d3\u05b0\u05d9\u05b8\u05d4; ibub may signify 'he has beautified,' habab in Assyrian having both meanings ibbu 'beautiful,' and abub 'a hurricane;' but the line is illegible, but the phrase must mean something like a desecration of the temples.\n\nFor \u05db\u05b7\u05bc\u05d3\u05b0\u05d3\u05b5\u05da\u05b0 cadduki, see Assurbanipal, p. 168, and Smith's note on the word, p. 332; \u00fasab\u00fal is the form of a root answering either to \u05d9\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05dc\u05b6\u05d4 or \u05d9\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05dc\u05b6\u05d4. It usually means in Assyrian 'to stop or cancel.' A word is usually palikha, not palakha, but both forms are possible. I cannot translate the end of the line even cautiously, assusu being a very uncertain reading.\n\nLine 8. ina abani la tabut is a very difficult phrase; abani, or apsani, as it has been usually read, has been translated differently by Smith, by Norris, and by Oppert, but in no case, as I think, successfully. ab\u00e1n I would derive, like ibat, from bas\u00e1 'to be,' and would render the common phrase emid ab\u00e1n\u00ed by 'I settled the business;' tabut I guess to be a Tiphal participle from the same root, but the word is, I believe, a new one. It seems to be a kindred form to hant, which occurs in the phrase kitt\u00fa bisit uzni sa mat\u00e1ti atta, 'thou art the power who givest ear (lit. 'art ears,') to the people.' B.M.I. vol. iv. pl. 28, l. 28. The grammatical construction, too, is difficult, and what adds to the confusion is that the reading itself is uncertain, the word possibly ending in \u05e1\u05b7\u05e2 sa, rather than in \u05e1\u05b7\u05e2 sut. Salkhu for 'an inner wall of defence,' is a well-known word, but there is no such root in the cognate languages as \u05d7\u05b2\u05dc\u05d5\u05b9\u05df, and I am obliged therefore to derive \u00fakhallikhu from \u05d7\u05b2\u05dc\u05d5\u05b9\u05df 'to be sick.'\n\nLine 9. Tazimti certainly means 'destruction,' and is used in this sense in 'the Tower of Babel' Legend (see Bib. Arch\u00e6ol. vol. v. p. 307), though Mr. Boscawen has there translated the word 'a strong-hold.' In the Astrological Tablets Tazimtu and Tazukhtu are often spoken of as 'mis-\nfortunes' befalling a country from evil omens (B.M.I. vol. iii. pl. 60, l. 21). Sayce translates 'devastation and rapine' (Bib. Arch\u00e6ol. vol. iii. p. 241, l. 21). I compare the roots \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b5\u05d9\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd and \u05de\u05b0\u05e8\u05b9\u05d3\u05b7\u05da. Whether \u05de\u05b0\u05e8\u05b9\u05d3\u05b7\u05da refers to the original Belus or to Merodach, it is impossible to determine positively, but I believe the latter application to be the true one. Bel in later Babylonian being indicated by \u05de\u05b0\u05e8\u05b9\u05d3\u05b7\u05da alone. Ki\u1e63ursun is a doubtful word, but may represent the Arabic \u062a\u0635\u0631.\n\nLine 10. With ugqati I compare \u05e4\u05b6\u05bc\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 or \u05e4\u05b6\u05bc\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 'a festival,' but the word may come from the root \u05e4\u05b6\u05bc\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5, referring to 'the mutterings of the Priests.' useribi is of course the Shaphel of \u05e4\u05b6\u05bc\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5, and means literally 'he caused to be enlarged.' It is difficult to distinguish in many cases between derivatives from erab 'to enter' and rabali 'to enlarge,' but the final i in useribi must, I believe, represent a weak radical letter, and I translate it therefore by 'celebrated' rather than 'introduced.' The completion of the phrase by 'was not seen' is purely conjectural. In continuation, sakhra from \u05e4\u05b6\u05bc\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 'to migrate or wander,' is a very doubtful word, and sa innad\u00e2 subatsun at the end of the line may either mean 'who had removed their seats' (from \u05e4\u05b6\u05bc\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 'to remove'), or, according to the more common use of the verb in Assyrian, 'who had established their seats,' i.e. 'were settled.'\n\nLine 11. im\u00fb may come from \u05e4\u05b6\u05bc\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 'to be obscured,' but sulamias is hardly to be explained grammatically, adverbs in as being, I believe, hitherto unknown. Smith translates salamtasu (Assurbanipal, p. 95, l. 85) by 'his attendants'; but that rendering has not much to recommend it. I have suggested a completion of the phrase so as to unite it with the next clause, the sense of which is tolerably certain. The last word indeed, ibr\u00eata, is the only one which is doubtful; the reading may be ibresu. A root \u05e4\u05b6\u05bc\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5, implying 'friendship,' is common in Assyrian. Compare \u05e4\u05b6\u05bc\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 'beloved,' in Song of Solomon, vi. 9.\n\nLine 12. Isteh\u00e9 is probably a Tiphel form of \u05e4\u05b6\u05bc\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5, answering to \u05e4\u05b6\u05bc\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 'to yearn after.' The word occurs in the great\nNebuchadnezzar Inscription, col. i. l. 53, where it is translated by Oppert 'il a examin\u00e9,' but without any sufficient authority. The construction from this point becomes difficult, as the suffix of the 3rd person is applied indifferently to Merodach, Cyrus, and Nabonidus, and it is only by the context that it is possible to distinguish between them. *Ittabi* (for *intabi*) and *nibit* are from the same root *\u0161\u0161\u0161*, according to the usual Assyrian practice. The last word of the line is doubtfully read as *sumsu* 'his name.'\n\nLine 13. *Ummanis*, used adverbially, is unusual, and the following letter on the Cylinder appears to be *\u0161\u0161\u0161* da rather than *\u0161\u0161\u0161* sa, but I can make no sense of *umman nida*. The *sulmat gagadu* or 'black heads' I have from the outset, and in spite of general opposition (Mr. Smith being the only Assyriologist who for many years adopted my reading), referred to the original dark-skinned population of Babylonia, as distinguished from the light-skinned mountaineer colonists; and I would here further draw attention to the fact that in one bilingual text (B.M.I. vol. iv. pl. 19, lines 37 and 38)\u2014unless there is a transposition of epithets and a double erasure, which seems unlikely\u2014these black-heads are identified with the *pitu panu* or 'broad-faces,' in apparent allusion to a negro type.\n\nLine 14. *Kittu* (for *kintu*) and *misaru* are joined together in the Inscription already quoted (B.M.I. vol. iv. pl. 28, No. 1, rev.), the Accadian equivalents of *\u0161\u0161\u0161* and *\u0161\u0161\u0161*, showing that the Assyrian roots are *\u0161\u0161\u0161* 'to establish,' and *\u0161\u0161\u0161* 'to direct.' *Tar\u00fa* I derive doubtfully from *\u0161\u0161\u0161* 'to feed,' *misaru*, which is common enough, being perhaps a cognate form. *Ibeet saminu* is also difficult; the roots, however, I suppose to be *\u0161\u0161\u0161* and *\u0161\u0161\u0161*, and I explain the 'double' action as relating to Cyrus's 'hand' and 'heart.' The last word of the line may be *ippalikh* 'he worshipped,' rather than *ippalid* 'he survived,' the final letter being injured and difficult to read.\n\nLine 15. With the last clause of this line compare the phrase in the Annals of Assurbanipal, p. 177, l. 78, *kima*\nipri tapp\u00e9a . . . ittanallaku ittisun, which Smith doubtfully translates 'like an earth-wall marched with him.' I suppose ibri to be 'a friend' as usual, and derive tapp\u00e9 (for tanp\u00e9) from \u1e6di 'benefit.' It is possible that idasu may be a later Babylonian corruption of the Assyrian ittisu 'with him,' (or id\u00e1 may be used for the Persian had\u00e1); but I prefer regarding id\u00e1 as the singular of id\u00e1t, which is often used in the inscriptions for 'forces.'\n\nLine 16. In the first clause of this line the only difficult word is uttad\u00fa, which may come from \u1e6du 'to know,' or from \u1e6du, the sense of the phrase being quite clear; but the second clause I cannot translate with any confidence, as all the words are doubtful. may mean 'troops' or 'swords,' the next word may be zanduca or khanduca, neither form giving a satisfactory meaning, and the verb issaddikha is a further difficulty, as the root \u1e6du is wanting in the cognate languages. Provisionally I read kakkiunu khanduca 'and their precious swords,' comparing khandu with khandi, applied to a sword in Assurbanipal, p. 157, l. 52, and issaddikha I derive from \u1e6du 'to expand.' Idasu as in the preceding line.\n\nLine 17. \u1e63eribas should be, I think, a Shaphel of \u1e6du 'to lie in ambush,' a root which is often used in Assyrian, and the phrase idir ina sapsaki would be literally 'he surrounded to opening,' idir coming from \u1e6du, and sapsaki being Shaphel of \u1e6du 'to open.'\n\nLine 18. ippalkit is represented, as is so often the case, by the monogram . The reading of the next word\n\n---\n\n1 A comparison of several passages in B.M.I. vol. iv. pl. 58, col. 1, lines 27 and 28, lines 50 sqq. and col. 2, lines 33 and 34, proves beyond doubt that ipri and tapp\u00e9 represent a connexion either of social juxtaposition or of consanguinity, the phrases in apposition being \"father and son,\" \"brother and sister,\" etc. I think \"friend and neighbour\" would be the most appropriate rendering, but I cannot discover a suitable etymology for tapp\u00e9.\n\n2 A root \u1e6du is often met with in the bilingual inscriptions, being used indifferently with \u1e6du to represent the Accadian monogram \u1e6du \u1e6du \u1e6du \"to lengthen or extend;\" but that can hardly be the signification in the present passage.\n\n3 Sayce translates sapsaki by \"opening,\" Grammar, p. 107; but on the other hand I find sapsaki used for the usual pasku \"difficult;\" in Layard's Ins. pl. 43, l. 1. The word may here signify either \"reducing to straits\" or \"opening,\" i.e., \"conquering.\"\nigmiya is so uncertain, owing to the fracture in the Cylinder, that it is useless to search for a suitable etymology, but the sense of the phrase may be depended on, though I should have taken \u1e6dnassiku for an orist rather than an infinitive. immiru will come from \u05d9\u05b4\u05de\u05b0\u05e8 or \u05d9\u05b4\u05de\u05b0\u05e8 'to change,' not a common root in Assyrian, but very suitable to this passage.\n\nLine 19. It is impossible to say positively whether the God Meroe or the Goddess Gula is alluded to in this line, as we have the feminine suffix in sa after tukulti, while all the other nouns and verbs are in the masculine. This confusion of gender is not uncommon in Assyrian, and is very puzzling. Both the God and the Goddess in question have in other passages the epithet of \"restoring the dead to life,\" but as the Greeks seem to have regarded the deity in question as answering to the Zeus Serapis of their mythology, I have decided in favour of Merodach; the phrase ina pasgu ra puk\u00e9 is unusual and ungrammatical, but pasgut applied to \"difficult\" roads is well known, and puk\u00e9 may correspond with the Arabic \u0639\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0649 'want.' istammaru I suppose to be an Istaphel form of \u05d9\u05b4\u05e1\u05b0\u05de\u05b0\u05e8 'to say.'\n\nLines 20 and 21, which are the most important in the whole Inscription, are, fortunately, quite perfect, and present no difficulties whatever.\n\nLine 22. ziru dar\u00fa is translated by Smith (Assurbanipal, p. 315, l. 98) 'the remote descendant,' but in this passage the allusion certainly seems to be to the hereditary royal line of Nebuchadnezzar. iksikha must come from the same root \u05d9\u05b4\u05e1\u05b0\u05de\u05b0\u05e8, which has produced khusukh 'famine' or 'distress.' Salimis 'victoriously,' is often used, and should come from a root \u05d9\u05b4\u05e1\u05b0\u05de\u05b0\u05e8, which, however, is not found in Hebrew.\n\nLine 23. khidat is written \u05d9\u05b4\u05e1\u05b0\u05de\u05b0\u05e8, as if \u05d9\u05b4\u05e1\u05b0\u05de\u05b0\u05e8 were used as a monogram for 'joy,' which is curious. Further on in the line we have a strange word ridpasu, which may mean 'his follower,' from \u05d9\u05b4\u05e1\u05b0\u05de\u05b0\u05e8 (comp. Turkish redi'), but I have never met with the word elsewhere. Here, unfortunately, occurs a fracture in the Cylinder, which for several lines\ndestroys the continuity of the text, and renders the sense uncertain. I do not attempt to restore the latter portion of the line.\n\nLine 24. In this line we have the same difficult word *tsaddikha*, which was met with in line 16, where I compared the root *\u05ea\u05b8\u05bc\u05e4\u05b7\u05e5* \u2018to expand\u2019 or \u2018spread over.\u2019 The sense must again remain doubtful. The last word *tsirsi* must be apparently a Shapel of *\u05ea\u05b4\u05bc\u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05e8\u05b5\u05d9*, but I am unable to complete the sentence.\n\nLine 25. The first word is imperfect, but must refer, I think, to the temples or buildings of Babylon; further on *asteh\u00e9* must be compared with the *isteh\u00e9* of line 12. The second clause of the line can only be explained conjecturally, owing to the mutilation of the text. The employment of the two well-known words *ankhut* and *usapdir* (from *padar* or *pathar*, Heb. *\u05ea\u05b8\u05bc\u05e4\u05b7\u05e5*) in the next line proves, however, that the general allusion must be to the repairs of ruined edifices, and I derive *napani* accordingly from the Chaldee *\u05e0\u05b8\u05e4\u05b7\u05df* \u2018to cure or make whole.\u2019\n\nLine 26. *ankhut* from *\u05e0\u05b8\u05e4\u05b7\u05df* is a well-known word, and *ipassikha* I refer to *\u05ea\u05b8\u05bc\u05e4\u05b7\u05e5* \u2018to spread\u2019; for *sarba* I can find no correspondent at present, but *\u05ea\u05b8\u05bc\u05e4\u05b7\u05e5*, or some form of it, is always applied to the bulging out of walls: the restoration which follows is doubtful, and the last word also of the line, *\u00fakhard\u00e9*, is difficult, coming apparently from a quadrilateral root. I have translated, however, as if the root had been *\u05ea\u05b8\u05bc\u05e4\u05b7\u05e5*.\n\nLines 27 and 28. There is nothing which requires to be noted in these lines except the concluding words *asib paraki*, which are used in the Inscriptions of Sennacherib in an ethnic sense, as if the epithet applied especially to Babylonia, the country of the *paraki* or high places \u2018par excellence.\u2019\n\nLine 29. *kalis* seems to be used adverbially, but the construction is quite unusual. *sutari*, also, at the end of the line, bracketed with *Akkharri*, Syria, is an unusual and difficult word. I have derived the word from *\u05ea\u05b8\u05bc\u05e4\u05b7\u05e5* \u2018to hide,\u2019 but doubtfully.\n\nLine 30. At the end of the line the city of Istar (prob-\nably Arbela) includes an epithet which I can neither read nor explain.\n\nLine 31. The names of the Babylonian cities are explained elsewhere.\n\nLine 32. There was probably a difference in Assyrian between \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd and \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd, \u00fasirb\u00e1 coming from the latter, and \u00fasirbi from the former. dadmi, at the end of the line, is always explained as a reduplicate form of \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd \u2018a man,\u2019 but I am not at all satisfied with this etymology, as the Assyrians do not appear to have admitted the Hebrew adam into their vocabulary: dadmi, indeed, seems to me to have had a special rather than a general application, and I give \u2018assemblies,\u2019 therefore, or \u2018congregations,\u2019 as a better translation than \u2018mankind.\u2019\n\nLines 33 and 34. These lines are perfect, and the words are all well known (except perhaps \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd mastaki, which I doubtfully give as an Istaphel form of \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd \u2018to be pure or holy\u2019), but the construction is a little confused. The allusion, however, would seem to be to the worship of the inferior deities, which was introduced by Nabonidus, as stated in the earlier part of the Inscription (compare line 10), and which Cyrus now confirmed by order of Merodach. I am not sure if the \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd of line 9 is the same as the \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd of line 33, nor if the deity referred to is Merodach or the elder Belus.\n\nLine 35. It is doubtful whether the opening of the line should be read yomisam makhar or yomisa ammakhar, but the sense would be pretty well the same with both readings. Observe that Cyrus here addresses Bel and Nebo, the special tutelar divinities of Babylon (compare l. 22), to recommend him to Merodach. The derivation of the verbal precatives litam\u00fa and litibkaru is not quite satisfactory (and the orthography of the latter word \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd is most unusual), but there can be no question as to the general sense. Patikhika, at the end of the line, seems an ungrammatical form.\n\nLine 38. A mere fragment of this line is preserved, in\nwhich, however, we have a familiar expression, *subti nikhti*. It occurs with the same verb in the great Tiglath Pileser Cylinder Inscription, col. vii. l. 34.\n\nThe remaining fragments of inscription are not worth examining in their present state, but possibly the Cylinder may some day be completed by further excavation of the ruined building in which it was found.\nART. III.\u2014Note on Hiouen-Thsang's Dhanakacheka. By ROBERT SEWELL, M.C.S., M.R.A.S.\n\nIn a Report\u00b9 recently sent to the Government of Madras on antiquities discovered at B\u0113zwada, and the Rock-cut Temple at Undavilli (both on the Lower Krishn\u0101 in South-Eastern India), I devoted considerable space to the question of the identity of the former place with the capital city of Dhanakacheka as described by Hiouen-Thsang. I do not claim to be in any sense considered as the originator of this discovery, Mr. Fergusson\u00b2 having previously pointed out, first the likelihood, and afterwards the certainty, that the two places were identical. But a residence of some years at B\u0113zwada enables me to speak with a local knowledge not possessed by many who have busied themselves with the study of Hiouen-Thsang's itinerary, and thus perhaps to be of some little use to those interested in such questions.\n\nI have been induced by several considerations to place the matter before the readers of this Journal in the form of a separate paper; first, because local knowledge is of great service in finally settling these questions; secondly, because disputes have arisen as to the locality of one of the monasteries described by the pilgrim; and thirdly, because the result of my inquiries has been, not only finally to confirm my previous conjectures, but also to give rise to a difficulty which is deserving of attention.\n\n\u00b9 Printed with Madras Government Orders (Public), dated 1st November, 1878. No. 1620. A copy was sent to the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\u00b2 Tree and Serpent Worship, p. 167; Journ. Roy. As. Soc. November, 1872, \"On Hiouen-Thsang's Journey from Patna to Ballabhi.\"\nShortly, the matter stands thus. B\u0113zw\u0101da is certainly the site of the capital city of Dhanakacheka. Hiouen-Thsang speaks of two monasteries there, whose position he describes, the \"Povra\u00e7il\u0101 Samgh\u0101r\u0101ma\" on the east, and the \"Avaracil\u0101 Samgh\u0101r\u0101ma\" on the west. The site of the former of these is established beyond dispute. Differences of opinion, however, exist as to the locality of the latter. Some eminent archaeologists have identified it with the stupa at Amar\u0101vati, which lies in a plain seventeen miles to the west of B\u0113zw\u0101da; but the kindness of the Rev. S. Beal in giving me a strictly close translation of the original passage enables me decisively to state that this theory is erroneous, and that the monastery in question was situated on one of the B\u0113zw\u0101da hills,\u2014namely, the one on the west of the town, where its remains are still to be seen. The result of this is that we are driven to the conclusion that the Si-yu-ki contains no allusion to the Amar\u0101vati Tope, though it was certainly in existence, and was by far the most magnificent monument in all India; and though the life of Hiouen-Thsang by Ho\u00ebi-li distinctly states that the pilgrim spent some months in the kingdom and visited its sacred places.\n\nFor the benefit of those who have not visited B\u0113zwada it is necessary that I should attempt to give some idea of the appearance and characteristics of that place. The town lies on the left bank of the Krishn\u0101 River, which forms its southern boundary, and about forty-five miles from the sea. It is shut in to the west by a rocky ridge of granitic formation about 600 feet high, running north and south, and terminating abruptly in a steep scarp at the river. At right angles to this ridge, and about half a mile from the river, is another ridge, similar but much smaller, forming a sort of natural protection to the town on the north. About a quarter of a mile from the western ridge, and close to the eastern end of the hill on the north, is a sharp-pointed detached mass of gneiss, about 350 feet high. On this last,\n\n1 Si-yu-ki, l. x.; Julien, ii. 111.\n2 V\u012b\u015b, etc., book 4; Julien, 189.\nas well as on the western ridge, are numerous rock-cuttings, steps, caves, cells, and the like.\n\nThe rock cuttings on the hill to the west are often of large extent. The only way in which, without the aid of plates, I can easily describe them, is as follows. Given the side of a prism. It is desired to form a horizontal platform half way up the slope. In order to this, the sloping side above the required base is cut down perpendicularly, and the whole mass between the horizontal base and the perpendicular cut is removed. The base then forms an exposed platform, on which the buildings are constructed. It will give a very fair idea of the scale on which the B\u0113zw\u0101da Buddhists worked, when I say that an accurate measurement of one\u2014and that not by any means the largest\u2014of these great quarried recesses gives a base of seventy-seven feet deep by thirty-three broad, with a perpendicular rock face in the rear measuring forty-eight feet in height. Of these cuttings there are many on the ridge bounding B\u0113zw\u0101da on the west, extending far along the hill-side. The bases are covered with rubbish and d\u00e9bris, possibly to a considerable depth, and this has not been cleared away; but remains found on the hill on the east show that, on the platform there, monolithic temples or residences had been left standing, the solid rock being hollowed out, the sides fashioned like walls, and then sculptured. Similar solid rock structures may have adorned the platforms on the western ridge.\n\nThe remains found on the hill to the east of the town are the remains of the \"Povragil\u0101 Samgh\u0101r\u0101ma.\" There is no dispute about this. And my contention is that the remains on the hill to the west are the remains of the \"\u0100vara\u1e47il\u0101 Samgh\u0101r\u0101ma.\" These last are of vast extent, and prove that the workers were thoroughly in earnest, and had the intention of erecting there temples, or shrines, or monasteries, of exceptional magnificence. Seen by themselves the cuttings confirm Hiouen Thsang's description of the grandeur of the monastery that stood there; for if by the stupendous works of preparation now visible we may judge of the magnificence of the completed design, then\nwe can understand that there may have been on this hillside in Hiouen-Thsang's day such a monastery as he described.\n\nNow the Amar\u0101vati Tope lies in a gently undulating plain on the opposite side of the river seventeen miles away to the west, and the question is whether the Chinese Pilgrim's description can possibly be held to apply to it. I have given an account of the mountains on each side of B\u0113zw\u0101da with the remains now to be seen on them. There is no hill within three miles to the east of Amar\u0101vati, nor on the west within twenty miles, nor on the south within nine or ten miles. On the north side lies the river, and the valley of the river there is four or five miles broad. The stupa itself was erected on a slightly rising knoll, about half a mile from the river-bank and surrounded by open country.\n\nNow let us turn to the Si-yu-ki for the account of the two monasteries. I place side by side Julien's translation in French, and Mr. Beal's in English; and I desire to point out that, in so kindly furnishing me with the latter, Mr. Beal was in possession of the subject of dispute and was therefore enabled to understand fully what I requested of him\u2014namely, a very close and accurate rendering of the original passage, with reference to the matter specially in hand.\n\nM. Julien's Translation.\n\nSur une montagne situ\u00e9e \u00e0 l'est de la ville, on voit un couvent appel\u00e9 Fo-p'o-chi-lo-seng-kia-lan (Pourva\u00e7il\u00e2 Sa\u1e45gh\u0101r\u0101ma).

Julien's rendering of the passage. It runs thus: \"\u00c0 l'est de la capitale, on a construit sur une montagne le couvent Fo-p'o-chi-lo-kia-lan (Po\u00fbrvac\u00eel\u00e2 Sa\u00f1gh\u00e2r\u00e2ma); \u00e0 l'ouest de la ville, on a \u00e9lev\u00e9 sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 oppos\u00e9 de la montagne le couvent 'O-fa-lo-chi-lo-kia-lan (Avarac\u00eel\u00e2 Sa\u00f1gh\u00e2r\u00e2ma). Un ancien roi de ce royaume l'avait construit en l'honneur du Bouddha et y avait d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 toute la magnificence des palais de Ta-hia (de la Bactriane).\"\n\nBesides these passages, it is to be observed that both the works give the reason why the monasteries were deserted in the days of the pilgrim's visit, and that they both state that this was due to the changed attitude \"of the spirit of the mountains.\" The Si-yu-ki, according to Julien, states: \"... depuis une centaine d'ann\u00e9es on n'y voit plus aucun religieux. L'esprit de la montagne se m\u00e9tamorphose; il prend tant\u00f4t la forme d'un loup, tant\u00f4t celle d'un singe, et \u00e9pouvante tous les voyageurs. C'est pourquoi ce couvent est d\u00e9sert et ne renferme plus de religieux.\" The companion volume of Ho\u00ebi-li has the following explanation: \"... depuis une centaine d'ann\u00e9es les esprits des montagnes ont chang\u00e9 de sentiments et font \u00e9clater sans cesse leur violence et leur col\u00e8re. Les voyageurs justement effray\u00e9s, n'osent plus aller dans ce couvent; c'est pour cela qu'aujourd'hui il est compl\u00e8tement d\u00e9sert, et l'on n'y voit plus ni religieux ni novices.\"\n\nThese passages, and especially Mr. Beal's rendering as\n\n1 I prefer the former of the two renderings as giving a very accurate description of what is to be seen on the hill-side at B\u00earwaq, though the second also applies, as there is a cavern of considerable size at the back of the monastery.\n\n2 This is an exact description of the situation\u2014the hill-free and its remains on the west of the town, as seen from the monastery on the hill to the east. For the expression does not mean \"on the opposite side of the mountain,\" but \"on the side of the mountain opposed to, or facing, this.\"\ngiven above, are conclusive, I consider, to prove that the Avara\u00e7il\u0101 Sa\u00f1gh\u0101r\u0101ma was on the side of a mountain to the west of the town, and not in a plain. The remains of it are to be seen in the great cuttings I have described on the steep mountain side to the west of B\u0113zw\u0101\u1e0da; just as the remains of the Po\u00fbrva\u00e7il\u0101 Sa\u00f1gh\u0101r\u0101ma are to be seen on the mountain to the east of the town. The remains of both monasteries are in the exact positions described by Hiouen-Thsang; and his description cannot possibly be held to apply to the Amar\u0101vati Tope, situated in the plain country in the valley of the K\u1e5bish\u1e47\u0101.\n\nBut there are other points to be noticed still more confirmatory. In speaking of the Avara\u00e7il\u0101 monastery Hiouen-Thsang says that the sovereign who made it \"bored out the river-course, constructing a road through it.\" Now the path from the town of B\u0113zw\u0101\u1e0da that leads up to the level of the platforms on the escarp of the mountain to the west of the town, passes up a gully caused by centuries of mountain torrents, and when it comes to the steepest part of the ascent, is conducted by steps through an almost perpendicular cliff, which has been cut into for the purpose, to the more level portion of the hill-side above it; so that the visitor at that part stands on steps with walls of rock artificially cut on each side of him. This is the \"river-course\" that has been bored into to construct a path. There before our eyes is the very piece of work described by Hiouen-Thsang in the seventh century as forming the approach to the galleries of the Avara\u00e7il\u0101 monastery; and it is by means of that path so constructed that the nineteenth century visitor passes from the town of B\u0113zw\u0101\u1e0da to the platforms in the mountain-side.\n\nLastly; close to the south of B\u0113zw\u0101\u1e0da are mountains, on one of which is the Undavilli rock-cut temple. Hiouen-Thsang describes the Po\u00fbrva\u00e7il\u0101 monastery as resting on the side of a mountain to the east of the city; the Avara\u00e7il\u0101 monastery as resting on the side of a mountain to the west of the city; and a mountain or cavern, connected with which the legend of Bh\u0101vav\u012bv\u0113ka, lying south of the city. East,\nwest, and south of B\u0113zw\u0101da are these remains still visible exactly as described. At Amar\u0101vati are no mountains or caverns of any kind.\n\nI contend, therefore, that it must be finally accepted that the Avara\u00e7il\u0101 Sa\u1e45gh\u0101r\u0101ma was on the mountain-side which bounds B\u0113zwada on the west; and that any theory which tries to prove the reverse totally opposes itself to the plain statements of Hiouen-Thsang.\n\nThis being so, it is clear, beyond all doubt, that Hiouen-Thsang does not mention the Amar\u0101vati Tope. Why he does not do so, I confess myself utterly at a loss to determine; and if any readers of this paper can help to elucidate the question, they will be rendering good service to the cause of South Indian archaeology. Hiouen-Thsang is in general so accurate that I can hardly believe the omission to be due to carelessness or accident; and there can be no question that the stupa was in existence in his days.\n\nWhile on the subject of the remains at B\u0113zw\u0101da, I think it worth while to notice a correction made by Mr. Beal of an error in M. Julien's translation of the Si-yu-ki with reference to the Rock-cut temple at Undavalli, which, as before said, lies close to the south of the former place. M Julien makes the passage run thus: \"\u00c0 une petite distance au sud de la capitale, il y a une grande caverne de montagne. Ce fut l\u00e0 que le c\u00e9l\u00e8bre ma\u00eetre des \u015a\u0101stras, P'o-pi-f\u00ea-kia (Bh\u0101vaviv\u0113ka), demeura dans le palais des 'O-sou-lo (Asouras), en attendant l'arriv\u00e9e de T'se-chi-p'oou-sa (M\u0101itreya Bodhisattva), et parvint \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat de Bouddha.\"\n\nNow the last phrase was puzzling, and it seemed to me that, if the translation were correct, the meaning, probably, was that Bh\u0101vaviv\u0113ka attained the rank of a Praty\u0113ka Buddha. But Mr. Beal has settled this point in a note which he kindly sent me. His translation is as follows: \"A little distance to the south of the city there is a large terraced mountain; this is the place where Bh\u0101vaviv\u0113ka, the master of the \u015a\u0101stras, remained (or, is located, i.e. at the present time) in the palace of the Asuras, awaiting the arrival of the Bodhisattwa M\u0101itreya, that he might (or may)\nsee him when he arrived (or arrives) at perfect intelligence (i.e. when he becomes Buddha).\u201d\n\nThe passage is thus rendered perfectly intelligible. Bh\u0101vaviveka was undergoing a course of devotion and asceticism, which would enable him to remain, without any further death or subsequent birth, till the future Buddha, Maitreya, makes his appearance on this earth. This culminated in the cavern south of the capital city of Dhanakacheka, when the rock miraculously opened of itself, and after the sage had entered, closed upon him. In the interior of this mountain, says Hiouen-Thsang, still rests Bh\u0101vaviveka, waiting for the event he so longed to see.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY NOTE.\n\nSince the above was written I have received another communication from the Rev. S. Beal, in which he authorizes me to publish, as the correct translation of the passage noted in the last paragraph but one of the above paper, the following rendering: \u201cThis is the place where Bh\u0101vaviveka, the master of the \u015a\u0101stras, remains in the palace of the Asuras, awaiting the arrival of the Bodhisatva Maitreya, that he may see him when he arrives at perfect intelligence.\u201d\n\nR. S.\n\nMr. Fergusson begs leave to append the following remarks to Mr. Sewell\u2019s paper. They are in substance what he said on the occasion of its being read in the rooms of the Society.\n\nI am quite prepared to admit that, taken in a literal sense, the words of the text of Hiouen Thsang may, with perfect fairness, be assumed to bear the interpretation Mr. Sewell extracts from them. At the same time, however, I contend that they are so vague, and so deficient in precision, that they may, with equal fairness, be construed so as to convey a\ntotally different meaning. If any one will take the trouble to glance at what has been written by M. Vivien de St.-Martin,\u00b9 General Cunningham,\u00b2 and myself,\u00b3 while trying to follow the route of this Pilgrim though India, he will see at what widely divergent conclusions three men\u2014knowing something of the subject\u2014can arrive at, from a study of his text, on a far more simple matter than this; even when all three were actuated only by an earnest desire to discover the truth. Nor is this to be wondered at, when we consider that the life of Hiouen Thsang was dictated to his secretary Hoei-li long after his return to China, and the Si-yu-ki was compiled from his notes by men who had never been in India, and were utterly unacquainted with the localities. Even, however, supposing it to have been originally correct, we need not go further than the present paper to see, from the discrepancies between M. Julien's and Mr. Beal's translations, how wide a latitude for discussion their discrepancies admit of, if we are forced to rely on the words of the author's text, and them only.\n\nJulien, for instance, does not mention \"a river;\" but it seems difficult to escape the conviction, that if a traveller is describing a city situated on an important one, as Mr. Beal's translation suggests, it can only be the river\u2014the Kistna\u2014and not a gully, down which water may flow during a shower of rain, but which would certainly be dry half an hour afterwards. At the same time, Mr. Sewell's description of the mode in which the hills \"terminate in a steep scarp at the river\" accounts more satisfactorily than any other known circumstance why the builder of the Avara\u00e7ila Samgh\u00e0-r\u00e2ma was obliged \"Ouvrir les flancs de la montagne,\"\u2014\"et creuser la vall\u00e9e, pour y pratiquer un chemin\"\u2014I believe from B\u00e9zwada to Amr\u00e2vat\u00ee, and not, as Mr. Sewell supposes, to find foundations for a monastery. It seems to me that what is said merely means that he provided stations and rest-houses\n\n\u00b9 Memoire Analytique, appended to Julien's translation.\n\u00b2 Ancient Geography of India, vol. i. 8vo., London, 1871.\n\u00b3 Hiouen Thsang's Journey from Patna to Balabhi, Journ. Roy. Asiat. Soc., Vol. VI. x.s.\nand accommodation for \"les voyageurs\" along the route. It was in fact a \"via sacra\" between the two places, similar to that described by Fa Hian as existing between Anuradhapura and Mahintale, and which exists there even at the present day. Throughout the whole paragraph, the Road appears to be the nominative to which all the rest is subordinate, and to which all the expressions consequently apply. It may have been washed away by the river since those days; but if Hiouen Thsang is to be depended upon, it certainly existed in his day.\n\nBesides this, there are certain expressions in the text which cannot, it seems to me, be made applicable to the site Mr. Sewell proposes. It never could have been \"entour\u00e9 des bois touffus\" or adorned by \"une multitude des fontaines jaillissantes,\" and so on, to make it \"un s\u00e9jour enchanteur;\" and the whole context seems to show that it was a spot far from the busy haunts of men, such as the Buddhists delighted in, where \"un millier des la\u00efques et des religieux venaient ensemble y passer la temps de la retraite.\"\u00b9\n\nThe very circumstances under which it is said to have been forsaken, and to have become a desert, seem to me wholly inapplicable to a monastery situated in the suburbs, in sight and almost within hearing of a large and busy town. The spirits of the mountains don't generally display their violence and anger within earshot of the police of an important city, so as to frighten \"travellers\" and prevent their going to a convent, which from the context, I take it, must have been at some distance. The whole narrative, in fact, in so far as I understand it, can only apply to some secluded spot, similar to those where all the principal groups of caves are situated, which in almost every instance were chosen for their seclusion and remote from towns or centres of population, and not in such situations as Mr. Sewell points to.\n\nThough it may be impossible to prove this, from the words of the text, it must, I think, be conceded that all the material facts of the case are opposed to Mr. Sewell's\n\n\u00b9 Ho\u00ebli, translated by Julien, p. 188.\ntheory. We now know pretty well what the Buddhists did and built between the age of A\u015boka (B.C. 250) and the time of Hiouen Thsang (640), and as I am now engaged, conjointly with Mr. Burgess, in passing through the press a work on the Cave Temples of India, I am probably in a position to state that there is not a rock-cut Buddhist establishment in the length and breadth of the land that in the least resembles the B\u0113zwa\u1e0da Monastery as proposed by Mr. Sewell. There are in India upwards of 1,000 separate excavations, all of which are noticed in more or less detail in that work. They extend from Girnar in Gujerat to Mah\u0101vallipur, south of Madras, and, though infinitely various in their arrangements, not one of them is, or ever has been, a structural building on a rock-cut platform. Wherever the Buddhists set to work to carve the rock, they invariably cut a cave into it, and did so at this very place B\u0113zwa\u1e0da, on the opposite side of the river; and it seems to me most improbable that they should have departed from their invariable practice while erecting what, from Hiouen Thsang's account, must have been one of the most important viharas in India.\n\nThe above considerations are probably sufficient to show how much uncertainty must attend any attempt to fix the site of the Avara\u00e7ila Samgh\u0101r\u0101ma from the text of Hiouen Thsang, if that alone is to be relied upon, and the question seems eventually to resolve itself into the consideration of the two following propositions.\n\nAt B\u0113zwa\u1e0da we have a locality which is utterly unlike any other known Buddhist site, and where there is absolutely nothing to prove that these platforms were not excavated by the citizens of B\u0113zwa\u1e0da as sites for their suburban villas. There is not a single carved stone, in or about the place, not one moulding in the rock, not one letter of an inscription, to show that any Buddhist, in any age, ever approached the spot, or attempted in any way to utilize it.\n\nOn the other hand, we have at Amr\u0101vati a Samgh\u0101r\u0101ma, which we know was not only figuratively, but actually adorned with \"all the art of the Palaces of Bactria,\" because we have\nlately recovered, from the lands to the westward of the Indus, a multitude of sculptures almost identical in execution and style with those that adorn that St\u016bpa. We know that it was standing when Hiouen Thsang visited the place, and that it is almost impossible he could have avoided seeing it during his sojourn of several months in B\u0113zw\u0101da; we know, too, that it merits all the praise he bestows upon it, and from the marbles that have been recovered from it, and which are in this country, that it was artistically the most beautiful and splendid of all the Buddhist Samgh\u0101r\u0101mas found in that country.\n\nUnder these circumstances, I think it may be fairly assumed that there are at least two sides to the question. It is probable that Mr. Sewell will still, in perfect good faith, adhere to his bare hill-side, and to this there is no objection; but, notwithstanding, I hope I may still be allowed to revel in the artistic glories of the Amr\u0101vati Tope, and to nurse the belief that it is the building described with so much enthusiasm by the Chinese Pilgrim.\n\nI shall not attempt to add anything regarding Mr. Sewell's theory of the Undavilli Cave. The argument is a long one, and I have entered upon it so fully in the work on the Cave Temples, above alluded to, that it seems unnecessary to repeat here what is said there. I may however state that both Mr. Burgess and I are convinced that, both in its inception and execution, the Undavilli Cave is wholly Brahmanical, and was not commenced till after Hiouen Thsang's visit to Dhanakacheka, and consequently is not the cave he alluded to.\n\nJas.

Eg. p. 148.] La gollah est encore en usage au Maroc pour l\u2019huile.\n\n6. Ne se trouve pas dans le Q\u00e2mol\u00fbs avec le sens de mesure. C\u2019est le xois (conge) des Grecs, mesure pour les liquides contenant trois litres et un quart environ. Cas\u00eer l\u2019appelle \u062d\u0648\u0633\u06cc (hol\u00fbs).\n\n7. \u0646\u0627\u0628\u06cc\u062c (sic). N\u2019a le sens de vase qu\u2019avec l\u2019orthographe \u0643\u0648\u0628. On peut comparer le mot d\u2019origine \u00e9trang\u00e8re \u0642\u0648\u0628 avec l\u2019expression du dialecte dorien \u03ba\u03bf\u03b2\u03b1, coupe, vase \u00e0 boire. \u0643\u0648\u0628 a d\u2019ailleurs le m\u00eame sens et se trouve plusieurs fois dans le Qor\u2019\u00e2n.\n\n8. \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0633\u06cc\u0642\u06cc\u0648\u0646, le \u03bc\u03cc\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 des Grecs, mystre, mesure contenant deux cuiller\u00e9es, et signifiant, dans le langage ordinaire, grande cuiller.\n\n9. Ne se trouve pas dans les dictionnaires avec le sens de mesure.\n\n10. Les mesures qui ne sont accompagn\u00e9es d\u2019aucune remarque se rencontrent fr\u00e9quemment dans les auteurs. Cf. mes Mat\u00e9riaux pour servir \u00e0 l\u2019histoire de la numism. et de la m\u00e9tr\u00eec. musulmane.\n\n11. \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0632\u06cc\u0648\u0646, et plus loin \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0632\u06cc\u0648\u0646. Ces termes ne sont pas donn\u00e9s par les dictionnaires. Peut-\u00eatre faut-il lire mazrabah, comme dans le Journal As., article de M. Behrnauer.\n\n12. Proprement quart. A pass\u00e9 dans l\u2019espagnol et est en usage \u00e0 Mazagan (Maroc) sous le nom d\u2019arreb\u00e2.\n\n13. C\u2019est-\u00e0-dire huiti\u00e8me.\nmechf\u00e2', (fo. 2r.) le qanqal, \u2014 le qafiz, \u2014 la k\u00e2rah, \u2014 le djartb, \u2014 le keurr et autres mesures (mak\u00e2y\u00ee) employ\u00e9es dans les pays \u00e9loign\u00e9s et dans les cit\u00e9s diverses.\n\nCes mesures varient suivant les contr\u00e9es, de m\u00eame que les ratsl diff\u00e8rent. Ainsi le gest, chez certains habitants du pays de Roum (Asie Mineure), contient en vin un ratsl et huit oncees. Chez telle population de l'empire islamique, sa contenance est de six ratsl, au (ratsl) de Bagdad, c'est l\u00e0 le grand gest ; et chez d'autres habitants du m\u00eame empire, elle est de trois ratsl ; c'est le petit gest.\n\nLe kous est, chez quelques-uns, de trente ratsl, au (ratsl) de Bagdad, et, chez d'autres, plus fort.\n\nLe davrag \u00e9quivaut, dans telle localit\u00e9, \u00e0 quinze ratsl, au (ratsl) de Bagdad ; il est plus faible dans telle autre.\n\nPour telle population, la faltajah p\u00e8se trois ratsl au (ratsl) balady ; et la qollah, dix faltajah, ce qui fait trente ratsl, au (ratsl) balady.\n\n1. Ne se trouve pas dans les dict. avec le sens de mesure. Plus loin ce mot est \u00e9crit plusieurs fois , ce qui me para\u00eet \u00eatre la v\u00e9ritable orthographe ; en effet le verbe signifie \"approcher les l\u00e8vres d'un vase pour y boire.\"\n\n2. \"Certaine grande mesure de substances s\u00e8ches.\" Kazim.\u2014Cette mesure \u00e9tait en usage dans les environs de Sadjelm\u00e2sah, Voy. El Bekri.\n\n3. Le gest me para\u00eet devoir \u00eatre identifi\u00e9 avec le Xeste ou setier romain (stern) de deux cytoles, et de la contenance de 54 centilitres.\n\n4. Cassir, i, p. 282 dit (d'apr\u00e8s MS. 839) que le gest de vin p\u00e8se 20 ounces ; ce qui fait bien 1 ratsl (= 12 ounces) et 8 ounces. Le ratsl romay est de 1024 derhams ou 72 m\u00e9tq\u00e2ls (Voy. El Djabarty, tableau, et M\u00e2r Eliy\u00e2, ch. iii.) Son once est donc de 6 m\u00e9tq\u00e2ls. En adoptant l'\u00e9valuation du derham donn\u00e9e par Mahmoud Bey (Le syst. m\u00e9tr. actuel de l'\u00c9g.) de 3 gr., 0898 on a pour le m\u00e9tq\u00e2l (= 1 derham) 4 gr., 414. Ce qui donne pour le gest 20 x 6 x 4 gr., 414 = 529 gr., 68.\n\n5. Ce qui fait 130 x 6 = 780 derhams, ou 128 x 6 = 771 derhams, suivant qu'on adopte l'approximation d'El-R\u00e2f\u00e9y (+ a. 623) ou celle d'En-Nawawy (+ a. 676) pour le nombre de derhams dont se compose le ratsl de Bagdad.\n\n6. Soit 130 x 3 = 390, ou bien 128 x 3 = 384.\n\n7. (sic).\n\n8. De Balad. Balady signifie le plus souvent \"de la ville, local\" ; mais je n'h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer le premier sens, attendu que l'auteur nous parle plus loin du D\u00eear-R\u00e2bi'h\u00e2h, r\u00e9gion dans laquelle \u00e9tait situ\u00e9e la ville de Balad. M\u00e2r Eliy\u00e2 nous dit (ch. iii.) que le ratsl de Balad (balady) \u00e9tait de 420 m\u00e9tq\u00e2ls. 3 x 420 x 4 gr., 414 = 561,64 pour la faltajah, et 55 kil. 616,4 pour les dix faltajah ou la qollah. La qollah d'huile p\u00e8se actuellement 30 kilogr. \u00e0 Casablanca et 17 kil. 280 \u00e0 Masagan.\n\nVOL. XII.\u2014[NEW SERIES.]\nLe h\u00fbs, qui est une des mesures du pays de Ro\u00fbm, p\u00e8se dix ratls, au (ratl) ro\u00fbmy.\n\nLe go\u00fbto\u00fbly est \u00e9gal \u00e0 dix onces, et le mo\u00fbratro\u00fbn, \u00e0 vingt metq\u00e2ls, qui font trois onces et un tiers du ratl ro\u00fbmy.\n\nChacune de ces mesures contient en vin les quantit\u00e9s susmentionn\u00e9es ; en huile, elles contiennent une quantit\u00e9 inf\u00e9rieure [d\u2019un dixi\u00e8me] \u00e0 celle du vin [et, en miel, un surplus] \u00e9gal au quart et au dixi\u00e8me de celui-ci. Ainsi toute [mesure] contenant dix ratls de vin contiendra neuf ratls d\u2019huile, et treize ratls et demi de miel, et toute mesure (kayl) contenant une quantit\u00e9 quelconque d\u2019huile contiendra en vin une quantit\u00e9 \u00e9gale, plus son neuvi\u00e8me et, en miel, une quantit\u00e9 \u00e9gale, plus sa demie.\n\nQuant aux mesures (mak\u00e2y\u00eel) des arides, elles varient \u00e9galement. Ainsi le djartb est chez les uns de quarante makko\u00fbk ; chez d\u2019autres, de trente-deux makko\u00fbk ; dans tel endroit, de vingt makko\u00fbk ; dans tel autre, de dix makko\u00fbk ; dans tel autre encore, il est moindre.\n\n1 Le MS. de Gotha \u00e9crit .\n2 (sic). Dans Casiri, Lc., ce mot se trouve \u00e9crit par un .\n3 C\u2019est la k\u00e9r\u00f4\u00fbn des Grecs. Un peu plus haut, le go\u00fbto\u00fbly n\u2019est pas mentionn\u00e9, et le mot qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de mo\u00fbratro\u00fbn est .\n4 On pourrait supposer que le copiste n\u2019ayant pas compris le terme qu\u2019il avait \u00e0 \u00e9crire s\u2019est arr\u00eat\u00e9 \u00e0 moiti\u00e9 chemin.\n5 Voir la note \u00e0 la fin du chapitre. $10 \\times 6 \\times 4 = 240$ gr., 84.\n6 Nous savons que 20 metq\u00e2ls = 28 derhams. Les 3\u00bd onces du ratl ro\u00fbmy \u00e9galent donc aussi 28 derhams. D\u2019o\u00f9 1 once ro\u00fbmy = 8 derhams. Or $8 \\times 12 = 102$, ce qui est bien le nombre de derhams attribu\u00e9 au ratl ro\u00fbmy par El Djabarty.\n7 Deuhn.\n8 C\u2019est-\u00e0-dire aux $\\frac{3}{10}$ du contenu de la m\u00eame mesure en vin. J\u2019ai ajout\u00e9 les mots plac\u00e9s entre crochets, \u00e9videmment omis par le copiste et indispensables au sens, ainsi que l\u2019indique la phrase suivante. Voir aussi la note \u00e0 la fin du chapitre.\n9 (sic) pour .\n10 Par exemple, le go\u00fbto\u00fbly contient 9 onces d\u2019huile, 10 onces de vin et 13\u00bd onces de miel. Voir la note \u00e0 la fin du chapitre.\nLe qafiz est chez (fo. 3) le plus grand nombre \u00e9gal \u00e0 huit makkouk;\u00b9 chez tel peuple, il est moindre.\n\nLa k\u00e2rah est \u00e9gale, chez celui-ci, \u00e0 seize makkouk,\u00b2 et, chez celui-l\u00e0, elle est d\u2019un chiffre diff\u00e9rent.\n\nLe ganqai\u00b3 enfin contient quatre makkouk.\n\nLa plus r\u00e9pandue de ces mesures\u2074 est le makkouk; il \u00e9quivaut, en (mesure) de l\u2019Ir\u00e2q,\u2075 \u00e0 trois kayladjeh,\u2076\u2014\u00e0 douze\u2077 rob\u2019,\u2014et \u00e0 quarante-huit tomm.\u2078 Dans le Di\u00e2r-Rabi\u2019ah, il est \u00e9gal \u00e0 quatre marzabah,\u2079\u2014\u00e0 seize kayl,\u2014et \u00e0 soixante-quatre mechf\u00e2 (sic.

Lors donc que tu voudras, avec les sandjah des derhams, obtenir les sandjah des metq\u00e2ls, prends la sandjah du derham et pose-la dans le plateau suspendu au plus long bras, qui est celui des dix divisions. Place dans l\u2019autre plateau la sandjah inconnue dont tu veux faire la sandjah du metq\u00e2l, et r\u00e8gle-la sur la sandjah du derham jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle arrive \u00e0 \u00eatre \u00e9gale \u00e0 celle-ci dans cette balance.

En somme donc, cette balance tiendra lieu de celle mentionn\u00e9e dans le chapitre pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent et des balances ordinaires.\n\nExemple. Tu prends une balance \u00e9gale (mostaey) comme toutes les balances, c'est-\u00e0-dire ayant les deux bras du fl\u00e9au \u00e9gaux (motas\u00e2wy). Partage l'un des deux bras en dix divisions, et perce sur la quatri\u00e8me division \u00e0 partir du milieu du fl\u00e9au, laquelle est en m\u00eame temps la troisi\u00e8me \u00e0 partir de son extr\u00e9mit\u00e9, un trou dans lequel tu placeras un anneau; puis suspend \u00e0 celui-ci un plateau. Ce plateau et celui qui se trouve suspendu au m\u00eame bras doivent \u00eatre \u00e9gaux en poids\u00b9 au plateau suspendu \u00e0 l'autre bras.\n\nLors donc que tu voudras, avec cette balance, d\u00e9duire les sandj\u00e2h des metq\u00e2ls [fo. 6] de celles des derhams, place les sandj\u00e2h des derhams dans le plateau qui se trouve isol\u00e9 et mets dans le plateau suspendu au fl\u00e9au aux trois divisions de l'autre bras, des sandj\u00e2h qui fassent \u00e9quilibre aux premi\u00e8res. On aura les sandj\u00e2h de l'or, correspondant aux derhams, \u00e0 raison d'un metq\u00e2l pour chaque derham. Les deux plateaux qui se trouvent aux deux extr\u00e9mit\u00e9s se faisant enti\u00e8rement \u00e9quilibre, quelque sandj\u00e2h que l'on y mette, le poids correspondant qu'on obtiendra sera \u00e9gal \u00e0 celle-ci. Sache donc cela.\n\nX. CHAPITRE DIXI\u00c8ME.\n\nSur la construction d'une autre balance munie d'un seul plateau et se comportant comme le ferest\u00f4an\u00b2 (la romaine):\n\n\u00b9 Le MS. de Gotha, comme celui de Paris, porte partout (qarast\u00f4an), et ce qu'il y a de plus curieux, c'est que ce nom a \u00e9t\u00e9 lu ainsi par G\u00e9rard de Cr\u00e9mone dans sa traduction (Liber Carastonis editus a Thabit filio Chere; Liber Thabit de ponderibus, qui dicitur Liber Carastonis). Cependant il faut lire ferest\u00f4an, mot persan, ainsi que M. le Dr. Leclerc en a fait le premier la remarque en ajoutant que dans la liste d'Ebn Ab\u00ee Osaybi'ah on trouve cit\u00e9\non y p\u00e8se l'or avec une seule roumm\u0101nah (contre-poids) et on obtient des metq\u0101ls; on y p\u00e8se l'argent avec une autre roumm\u0101nah et en obtient des derhams : le fl\u00e9au est le m\u00eame, ainsi que les traits et les divisions.\n\nAyant choisi un fl\u00e9au bien droit et \u00e9gal (mostawy), tu suspendras un plateau \u00e0 l'un de ses deux bras\u00b9 et partageras l'autre bras, \u00e0 partir du milieu du trou du l\u00e9san\u00b2 et jusqu'\u00e0 l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 du bras, en autant de divisions que tu voudras avoir de metq\u0101ls ou de derhams. Tu placeras du c\u00f4t\u00e9 o\u00f9 il n'y a pas de plateau un poids (taql) qui fasse \u00e9quilibre au plateau, de telle sorte que, la balance \u00e9tant suspendue, le fl\u00e9au se trouve horizontal. Puis tu fabriqueras pour cette balance deux contre-poids,\u00b3 c'est-\u00e0-dire deux roumm\u0101nah, dont l'une sera pour l'or, d'apr\u00e8s la valeur (megd\u0101r) des divisions \u00e9tablies sur le fl\u00e9au, (\u00e0 raison d') un metq\u0101l pour chaque division. Le poids de l'autre roumm\u0101nah sera en sandj\u0101h (sandj) de l'argent, d'apr\u00e8s la valeur de ces divisions, chaque division correspondant \u00e0 un derham. En effet, cette op\u00e9ration faite, mettons de l'or dans le plateau et pesons-le avec le contre-poids\u2074 de l'or, nous obtiendrons le poids de cet or et nous en connaitrons le montant\u2075 en metq\u0101ls et fractions de metq\u0101l, d'apr\u00e8s les divisions \u00e9tablies sur le fl\u00e9au. Mettons au contraire de l'argent dans le plateau, et pesons-le avec le contre-poids de l'argent, nous en obtiendrons le poids et saurons \u00e0 combien de derhams et de fractions de derham il monte.

CHAPITRE ONZI\u00c8ME.\n\nSur la description et les caract\u00e8res distinctifs du garastouin (ferestouin).\n\nLe meilleur garastouin (ferestouin) est celui dont le cou\\(^1\\) est long. En effet, plus son cou est long, plus (la romaine) est sensible et rapide;\\(^2\\) plus il est court, plus elle est paresseuse.\\(^3\\) C'est pour ce motif\\(^4\\) que la pes\u00e9e est plus exacte\\(^5\\) avec le petit b\u00e2b de tout garastouin (ferestouin) qu'avec le grand b\u00e2b. Quand la suspension du grand b\u00e2b est plac\u00e9e exactement entre la suspension du petit b\u00e2b et celle\\(^6\\) du plateau, les rats et les m\u00e9tallos que d\u00e9terminera le grand b\u00e2b seront le double\\(^7\\) de ce que d\u00e9terminera le petit b\u00e2b. Si l'espace compris entre la suspension du grand b\u00e2b et celle du petit b\u00e2b est \u00e9gal \u00e0 deux fois l'intervalle qui s\u00e9pare la suspension du grand b\u00e2b de celle du plateau, ce que d\u00e9terminera le grand [b\u00e2b] aura trois fois le poids\\(^8\\) de ce que d\u00e9terminera le petit b\u00e2b. Ce m\u00eame (principe) se manifestera, lorsque l'intervalle sera plus grand.\n\nIl convient aussi que nous sachions que le rapport du bras le plus court au bras le plus long de tout garastouin (ferestouin) est comme le rapport du poids de la roumm\u00e2nah au poids que d\u00e9termine ce garastouin (ferestouin) avec ce b\u00e2b. [Si donc le bras le plus long est \u00e9gal \u00e0 trois fois le bras le plus court, ce que d\u00e9terminera ce garastouin (ferestouin), avec ce b\u00e2b, sera] \u00e9gal \u00e0 trois fois le poids de la roumm\u00e2nah.\\(^9\\) C'est d'apr\u00e8s\n\n\\(^1\\) \u0639\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0642\u064c.

V.\u2014On the Age of the Ajant\u00e1 Caves.1 By RAJENDRAL\u00c1LA MITRA RAI BAHADUR, C.I.E., LL.D., and Honorary Member of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nIn a paper published in volume xlvi.2 of the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, I attempted to identify the nationality of some foreign figures depicted in the rock-cut caves at Ajant\u00e1. The conclusions I arrived at were:\n\n1st. That the figures with long flowing coats and sugar-loaf hats in one of the pictures were Persians.\n\n2nd. That the principal personages in three \"Drinking scenes\" were Bactrians.\n\n3rd. That the scenes represented phases of Indian life from 1800 to 2000 years ago.\n\nMy reasons for the first two conclusions I gave at length; but with regard to the last, I contented myself by referring incidentally to the opinions of Messrs. Fergusson, Burgess, and Bh\u00e1\u00fa D\u00e1i. The subject of the paper was not a chronological one; and to chronology, therefore, I did not wish to devote any great part of a necessarily short note. My sole object was to invite the attention of antiquaries to the presence of Persians and Bactrians in Indian pictures, and to it, therefore, I confined my remarks.\n\nI am glad to notice that my object has been fully attained;\n\n---\n\n1 I received this paper in July, and laid it before our Council Meeting on the 7th idem, the last meeting of the Session. I have since, in the exercise of a large discretion given to me by the author, revised it to the extent of omitting some passages, and of here and there modifying others. The present title of the paper is adopted by the author's wish, expressed in a later letter\u2014his main contention being that the cave containing the picture lately remarked on by Mr. Fergusson is of an earlier date than that assigned to it in the \"History of Indian Architecture.\" He supports this view by arguments which he considers afforded by the inscriptions within the cave. This side of the chronological question has not yet been presented to the readers of our Journal. The author had proposed to illustrate his paper by four woodcuts, of which three are copies of plates in Ker Porter's work; but as these can readily be referred to, I do not see that any useful object would be gained by publishing the cuts which he inclosed with his paper. To follow the author it will of course be necessary to consult the four excellent plates published with his first paper in the Bengal Society's Journal.\u2014A. Ghote, Oct. 25, 1879.\n\n2 See Part i. p. 62.\nand that so distinguished an archaeologist as Mr. James Fergusson has taken it up in earnest, and brought his extensive knowledge and experience to bear upon it. And it is especially gratifying to me to know that the first of my three conclusions (viz. the nationality of the figures in the \"Court scene\") has met with his assent. He had, he says, arrived at that conclusion some years ago, though he did not publish it.\n\nMy second conclusion, as to the Bactrian nationality of the figures in the \"Drinking scene,\" is not referred to by Mr. Fergusson, who regards these also as Persians, on the following grounds: 1st, because crimped streamers, or \"banderoles,\" such as are worn by the figures, are characteristic of the Sassanian kings; 2nd, because their head-dress is similar to that of the Persians represented in sculpture at Takht i Bost\u00e1n and elsewhere; 3rd, because the story of the pictures corresponds with incidents in the history of Kh\u00fbshr\u00fb Parviz, with whom he identifies the principal figure.\n\nAfter the most careful study of the pictures, I must avow my inability to perceive any ethnic relationship between the foreign figures in the \"Court scene\" and the burly Bacchanalian figures in the \"Drinking scenes.\" Features so decisive as ethnic tests, when generalized after a study of large numbers, become dubious when studied in single individuals; and in smudgy pictures and defaced sculptures are peculiarly unsatisfactory. As far, however, as they go, they afford, to me at least, no reason to suppose that the oval-faced, sharp-featured Ambassador and his suite belonged to the same nationality with the broad-headed, high cheek-boned lover of the \"Drinking scene.\" Quite agreeing with what is said as to the impossibility of \"identifying the portrait of the King (the Bacchanalian lover) in those pictures from any of the sculptured representations of him,\"\u00b9 I am equally unable to follow the general resemblance discernible by Mr. Fergusson in the figure of the \"Hunting scene,\" engraved by Ker Porter, vol. ii. pl. 64.\n\nIn single instances the dress is much more expressive;\n\n\u00b9 Journal Royal Asiatic Society, Vol. XI. p. 164.\nand that test brought to bear on the picture does not, to my mind, disprove my theory of these figures being Bactrian. The crimped streamers or \"banderoles,\" on which so much stress has been laid, are by no means the peculiar characteristics of the Sassanians. They appear as ornaments over the cap; or as the floating ends sometimes of the fillet round the head, sometimes of the bandeau tying the cap behind the head, or binding crowns of leaves or necklaces; or as wings behind the shoulder-blade; and in one or other of these forms they occur on the coins of the Bactrian kings Eukratides, Kadphises, Herm\u00e6us and others, as well as on those of the Indo-Scythian kings Kanerki and Ooerki, and on sculptured figures of Rajput warriors.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe head-dress is equally at fault. The hat of the Ambassador is shaped like a sugar-loaf. It is such as is shown on the head of the modern Persian standing by the side of the pillar in Ker Porter's plate 62, and as was worn by the attendants of the Shah of Persia on his late visits to Europe. It has been repeatedly figured by Malcolm in his \"History of Persia,\" and is sufficiently conspicuous in the costume of the messengers in the \"Ambassador's scene;\" but in the costume of the Bacchanal it is wanting. His hat is short and dumpy, and has a broad band at the base. In one instance it has two streamers on the top, but in the other two those appendages are omitted. They are invariably absent on the conical cap. It is not easy to trace much resemblance between the two hats, while they differ from the hat or crown of Kh\u00fbshr\u00fb, as shown in sculpture at Takht i Bost\u00e1n.\n\nThe coat of the Ambassador is a close-fitting one, hanging below the knee; and over it there is a tight jacket of a different stuff, buttoned in a line in the middle of the front. The officers of his suite have the same style of body-clothes, except the military attach\u00e9 in helmet, whose coat is somewhat shorter. The Bacchanal wears a loose blouse or caftan, without buttons in front, or any indication of the way in\n\n\\(^1\\) *Vide passim*, Wilson's \"Ariana Antiqua,\" pl. ii. figs. 3 and 6; pl. iii. fig. 4; pl. v. figs. 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20; pl. vii. fig. 6; pl. viii. fig. 10, and several figures in plates ix. x. xi. xii. xiii. xiv. xv. xvi. xvii. xix. xx.\nwhich it was fastened to the person. It is decorated with patch-work ornaments, but there is no jacket over it. The lady indulges in patch-work; and the *tout ensemble* of her dress is quite unlike that of the dress of Sh\u012br\u012bn in the Takht-i Bost\u0101n sculptures.\n\nAs regards the incidents in the history of Kh\u016bshr\u016b Parviz, supposed to be referred to in the picture, the substance of the narrative quoted from Tabari amounts to this, that Kh\u016bshr\u016b II. received an embassy from an Indian potentate. There is no allusion to a return embassy; on the contrary, it says that the Indian Ambassador brought a letter, marked private, in which the writer of the note congratulated one of the sons of the King on the near prospect of his supplanting his father and becoming \"the ruler of the whole empire.\" The King was naturally offended at this, and so, he says, \"We closed the letter with our seal, and gave it into the keeping of our consort Sh\u012br\u012bn.\" It would be natural to suppose that the King, under the circumstances, would never think of sending a complimentary embassy to a foreigner who secretly suggested his dethronement. It is, I think, difficult to accept the passage cited from Tabari as explaining the scene of the picture. The intercourse between the Indians on the one hand, and the Persians, the Assyrians, and the Egyptians on the other, was, probably, more frequent in past times than it is now, and embassies may have passed and repassed scores, if not hundreds, of times from long before the commencement of the Christian era, and the fact of there being a picture of an embassy in one place, and the notice of another embassy elsewhere, hardly justifies the assumption that one relates to the other.\n\nThe name, too, of the Indian King in the text of Tabari is represented by letters without diacritical marks, and may be variously read Faramsha, Firamsha, Furamsha, Qaramsha, Qiramsha or Quramsha; each of these optional forms being subject to further variations by the insertion of an *i* or *y* after the *m*. By first discarding \"the value of the vowel points as of no authority in foreign names,\" and by next assuming the consonants, which are in some cases variable, to have\nnecessarily undergone changes, the word is made out to be Pulakesi; and having come to this, the reading is accepted as the major premise for the next argument. The identification of the name may, or may not, be correct. If it be correct, it would show that Khushr\u00fa's Indian correspondent was Pulakesi, but it would not suffice to connect the \"Court scene\" in the Ajant\u00e1 picture with that king.\n\nThe chronological question, however, is the really important one, and this is fully recognized in Mr. Fergusson's paper, which will, I think, bear me out in stating the following to be his conclusions as to the age of the Ajant\u00e1 Caves. He says, \"As everything depends upon it, the first point is to ascertain the age of the cave in which these paintings are found;\" and from the materials accessible, he thinks that \"this can be easily done within very narrow limits of deviation either way.\" Substituting the word moderate for \"very narrow,\" I readily subscribe to this remark; but I cannot help thinking that he has not utilised to the fullest extent the materials that were accessible to him.\n\nHis conclusions are that Cave No. XII. is the oldest, and that the others on its two sides correspond in age in the order in which they stand, thus:\n\n| XII. Oldest, second century B.C. |\n|---------------------------------|\n| X. Coeval with last or slightly later. |\n| X. More modern, first century B.C. |\n| XI. Later. |\n| VIII. Later still. |\n| VII. \" |\n| VI. \" |\n| V. \" Correspond No. |\n| IV. \" for No. with |\n| III. \" |\n| II. Latest,\" 610 to 640 B.C. |\n| I. \" Correspond with |\n\n| XIII. |\n| XIV. |\n| XV. |\n| XVI. |\n| XVII. |\n| XVIII. |\n| XIX. |\n| XX. |\n| XXI. |\n| XXII. |\n| XXIII. |\n| XXIV. |\n| XXV. |\n| XXVI. Coeval with I., or slightly more modern. |\n\nLater than No. 1.\nThese deductions have been made by reference to the character of the ornaments\u2014the simpler, the more ancient; the more elaborate, the later; and also by comparison with caves in other parts of India of more or less known ages. Thus, No. XII. is said to be the oldest, because \"it is an extremely plain and simple excavation, without pillars, which, in itself, is an indication of great antiquity, while such ornaments as it has are so similar to those that adorn other caves at Baja, Bedsa, Nassik, and elsewhere, whose age is ascertained to be before the Christian era.\" No. I. is said to be the latest, because \"from its position it is the cave last excavated at this end of the series.\" The argument is, however, somewhat qualified by the remark that, \"if not the very last, it is certainly among the most modern excavations at Ajanta.\" For this conclusion, however, no reason is assigned. Very little argument has been adduced for the gradation in age of the other caves; and the settlement of the dates is mainly dependent on the opinion of the writer. This opinion, however, proceeding from so high an authority, is worthy of the fullest consideration, and under ordinary circumstances it would be extremely imprudent on the part of a person like me to question it. But the facts to be presently disclosed leave me no alternative.\n\nI must demur to the theory founded on the absence of pillars, a fact which does not always show great antiquity. More than one Udayagiri Cave, bearing L\u0101\u1e6d inscriptions, have pillars, and as cave architecture (not cave-cutting) must have followed wooden structures, there is no *a priori* reason why pillars should be wanting in caves of early date, but of a time when men had long since enjoyed the benefit of wooden houses.\n\nBut that theory apart, the principle of gradual improvement on which the learned antiquary's opinion is founded is such a trite axiom in history that no one would think of questioning it. It is one thing, however, to have a general principle, another to apply it to particular cases, making due allowances for the influences of the different factors which bear upon them. As regards Indian archaeology, after\nmany years devoted to its study, I feel convinced that as yet adequate materials have not been collected to enable even the most experienced scholar to settle the ages of ancient Indian caves within any moderate limits of variation, by reference to the amount of ornaments occurring on them. The data now available for such a purpose are insufficient, and cannot be relied upon. In commenting upon the age of the Udayagiri Caves, in the second volume of my \"Antiquities of Orissa\" (long since printed, but not yet published), I have remarked: \"Adverting to the Caves of Western India, Mr. Fergusson has developed a system of evolution, according to which the simplest of the caves are assigned to the earliest period, and the most ornate to a comparatively recent date\u2014the whole spreading over many centuries. How far this is correct as regards those caves, it is not for me here to inquire; but I am not at all disposed to apply the principle to the caves which form the subject of my remarks. The principle is founded upon the experience of human habitations in civilized society, and cannot be applied to monasteries. Monastic institutions do not develop slowly and gradually, step by step, with the advancing civilization of their occupants, even as the ancient pile huts of Zurich and Brienne and Neufchatel developed into Swiss villas; but by fits and starts, according to the nature of the patronage extended to them by civil society, and the state of civilization of their patrons\u2014the monks themselves being the passive recipients of the bounty of their lay admirers, and the art displayed in their habitations dependent mainly on the taste of the artists employed, and of their employers. A hermit of great sanctity, perhaps professing some supernatural or miraculous powers, takes shelter in a wood near a flourishing town, whence men of all classes proceed to visit him and offer him the means of his sustenance and more, in lieu of his blessings; a wealthy person, perhaps a king or a minister, takes special interest in him, and defrays the cost of building a comfortable house for his use; his sanctity draws around him shoals of proselytes and followers, for whose accommodation addi-\ntional buildings are required; other rich men defray the cost thereof; and a stately monastery is the result. In the place of the hermit an image of a god, or a rude stone, or a grave, or a sacred relic, suddenly rising in repute for working miracles, or for some other cause, produces the same effect. In the first fervour of devotion, wealth flows rapidly towards its endowment and embellishment, edifices rise over and around it, and a sacred place is completed.\n\nAll this takes but a few short years, and the lifetime of a single generation is generally enough to effect the consummation. A different feeling next comes into play, that of respect for antiquity, which develops a strong spirit of conservatism, and its main objects are to give firmness to, and to perpetuate, existing customs, practices and observances, and to prevent changes and innovations. Devotion then leads to the erection of minor edifices around the principal building, in order to secure for them a share of the reflected sanctity of the original shrine. Hence it is\u2014in India at least\u2014that the richest and most elaborate shrines are the oldest, and the temples and other structures around them are of comparatively recent dates. The merit of dedicating temples, ghats, chaityas, and the like in sacred places, is greatly extolled in the S\u00e1stras, both Hindu and Buddhist, and every pilgrim erects one according to his means, and if he has not the wherewithal to build a temple, or a chaitya, however humble, he satisfies his conscience by dedicating a fictile or stone model, ranging from two inches to three or four feet. Benares receives every year an accession of many scores of such temples, some of which are cubes of three or four feet with corresponding pinnacles, and the thousands of model chaityas in stone and baked clay which have been met with at S\u00e1nchi, Buddha Gay\u00e1, S\u00e1rnatth, and other places, owe their origin to the same cause.\n\n\"That the caves of Udayagiri have come into existence under some such circumstances I have every reason to believe. Bhuvan\u00e9vara, before the commencement of the Christian era, was a flourishing town, if not the capital,\nof Kalinga. Some Buddhist hermits of great repute, or a body of monks, must have come there for missionary purposes, and, prohibited to dwell in towns, taken their stand on the hill, which was near enough to admit of their going frequently to the town on their missionary errand, and for begging alms, and yet sufficiently removed from civil society to keep them aloof from its contamination. The Kalinga R\u0101j\u0101s, who were noted for their devotion to Buddhism, helped them to excavate some large caves, and the monastery was complete. The little caves were, I imagine, subsequently dug by individual hermits for their respective accommodation or mortification\u2014for the three or four feet cubic caves were undoubtedly made for the sake of undergoing some form of penance or other. If we assume that some of the missionaries first dug the small caves to display their sanctity or devotion to penance, by dwelling therein, it would follow that they attracted the attention of the people\u2014for such a feat as passing night after night, say in meditation, within a cave of three feet, would attract public attention in India in a very short time, and the wealthy among those who admired, or looked with veneration upon, such feats, would at once defray the cost of making large and commodious habitations for such saints and their followers. In either case the interval of time between the small and the large caves would be limited, and cannot be reckoned by centuries; there is nothing in them at any rate to support the theory of gradual development of taste and tact in cave-cutting; for the larger caves are all of one class, and belong to a single cycle. Their pillars are of the same pattern; the pilasters are alike; the carved bands over them have the same outline; the Buddhist rails, either above or below the friezes, differ only in some being made of four and others of five bars; the parapets, where they occur, are alike; and the general design differs so slightly as to be insignificant, and in none of these features\u2014and these are the principal features which mark the difference of style and age\u2014can anything be found which would warrant the assumption that the caves belong to different\nages, and were cut by men in different states of civilization, or possessed of art-education differing in other respects than in individual peculiarity.\"1\n\nI have met with nothing since which would induce me to change this opinion. On the contrary, many facts have come to my notice which lead me to believe that what is true as regards the caves at Udayagiri is equally so with reference to those at Ajant\u00e1.\n\nIt is, however, not on such d priori arguments that I wish to rely in the present instance. So long as forty years ago James Prinsep obtained some inscriptions from Ajant\u00e1, and published them in the fifth volume of this Journal. Mr. Bird, in 1847, published some others in his \"Historical Researches on the Origin and Principles of the Buddha and Jaina Religions;\" and, in 1863, the late Dr. Bh\u00e1\u00fc D\u00e1j\u00ed re-examined and revised all the inscriptions that he could find at Ajant\u00e1, and published facsimiles, transcripts, and translations thereof in the Journal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society;2 and the evidence derivable from these inscriptions is opposed to the conclusions of Mr. Fergusson.\n\nOne of these inscriptions occurs in Cave No. XII. It is cut into the rock in the L\u00e1t character, which antiquaries are unanimously of opinion retained its integrity to the close of the third century B.C., but changed in the following century to something different. If the evidence of this character be of any weight, it would follow, that the cave in which it occurs must date from before the second century B.C. to which Mr. Fergusson assigns it.\n\nCave No. IX., which Mr. Fergusson takes to be either coeval with, or slightly later than, No. XII., has an inscription in the same L\u00e1t character engraved on the face of the living rock, and another in the Cave character painted in fresco, as the pictures are. The two caves, therefore, may be taken to be of the same age.\n\nMr. Fergusson assumes No. X. to have been excavated\n\n---\n\n1 Antiquities of Orissa, vol. ii. pp. 40ff.\n2 Vol. vii. pp. 65, etc.\nsome time after No. IX., but it, too, has inscriptions, both in the L\u0101\u1e6d and the Cave characters, the former engraved and the latter painted; and if their evidence be of any value, all the three should be of the same date, or of such different dates as to be inappreciable and immaterial in an inquiry like the present.\n\nNo. XI. has been described to be later than No. X., but the argument on which this opinion is based being the same which made No. X. to be later than No. IX., must be rejected, and all the four caves accepted to be of the same or about the same age.\n\nMr. Fergusson's second group of caves comprises Nos. VIII. to III., with their corresponding set of Nos. XIV. to XX. No attempt has been made to assign to these any specific dates; they are supposed to have been excavated from time to time successively in the order in which they have been graded till the last of the series, viz. No. XX. (with, I presume, its counterpart on the other side, i.e. No. III.) came into existence within the last twenty years of the sixth century or the first ten years of the seventh century. It is left to be presumed that the others were cut in the first, the second, the third, the fourth, and the fifth centuries.\n\nOf the first series, No. VIII., called the Chaitya Cave, has a painted inscription above a painted Buddha over the entrance; and No. VI. has likewise one; but Nos. VII., IV. and III. have none. The second series of the group, the counterparts of Nos. VIII. to III., include three caves, viz. Nos. XVI. XVII. and XIX., which have inscriptions. No. XVI., called the Zodiac or Shield Cave, has a very large one engraved in the rock over the entrance, and three painted ones inside. No. XVII., the Vih\u0101ra Cave, has a large engraved one by the right side of the porch, and fragments of two painted ones inside. No. XIX. has an engraved one on a broken column. The character used in the inscriptions is the same which has been employed in some of the inscriptions in the first group of caves.\n\nThe third group of Mr. Fergusson includes Nos. II. and I. on one side, and Nos. XXI. to XXVI. on the other. Of\nthese he assigns No. I. to 610 to 640 A.D., and takes Nos. XXII. XXIII. and XXIV., the \"unfinished\" ones, to be later than No. I.; and No. XXVI. to be coeval with or slightly more modern than that cave. Unfortunately for this assignment, No. I. has more than one painted inscription in the same character as in the preceding group, No. XXV. has a rock-cut inscription, and Nos. XXI. and XXV. a painted one, each in the same kind of letters.\n\nThe engraved and the painted letters are not exactly of the same kind; nor are the painted letters of the same pattern everywhere. They were obviously written and engraved by different individuals, and consequently differ both in style, and, in some cases, in the form of the letters. But they all belong obviously and most unmistakably to the three classes of character numbered 2, 3, and 4 in James Prinsep's \"Illustrations of the Sanskrit Alphabet.\" Prinsep calls No. 2 the \"Western Cave character,\" and places it between Nos. 1 and 3, adding that its date was uncertain; No. 3 is founded on the model of the Rudrad\u00e1ma inscription of Junagar; and No. 4 on the Guzerat dated plates, which belong to the second century A.D. All the three are local or periodical variations of the same type, which ultimately merged into the Gupta character. The last had been in use for about three centuries, and ceased with the close of the fifth century, after which no authentic record has been found in that character. Most of the Gupta letters are similar to those of the preceding types; but there are certain test letters, such as \u0923, \u092a, \u092e, \u0930, \u092f and \u0937, which enable us easily to mark the difference between the Gupta and its preceding types.\n\nJudged by these test-letters, the inscriptions in the Ajant\u00e1 Caves, except those in the L\u00e1t character, belong to the Rudrad\u00e1ma type, or No. 3, with a leaning sometimes towards No. 2, sometimes towards No. 4, i.e. they hold an intermediate position between the third century B.C. and the second century A.D., that is to say, the latter part of the first century B.C. The names of Vindhy\u00e1sakti and his successors, and their relation to the Scythians, the \u015aaka\nYavanas, in the large inscription in the Zodiac Cave, would fit in better in the first century of the Christian era, and that is the most probable time when the latest of the caves were completed, and all were in existence. If we accept even the lowest limit of our palaeographic evidence, we can bring the caves to the second century, but not later, and that would be about five centuries before the time which Mr. Fergusson has assigned to the latest of them from a study of their architectural character. I have a strong leaning in favour of palaeographic evidence, which I believe to be much more authentic and less misleading than aesthetic tests which yield too much elbow-room for speculation, and are wanting in that certainty which inscriptions rightly interpreted are calculated to afford.\n\nWere I to conceive that the letters of the inscriptions under notice are of the Gupta type, they could be made to come down to the fifth century, but not later; and that would be a hundred and fifty years before the time suggested by Mr. Fergusson. But no Orientalist familiar with Indian palaeography will, I feel convinced, for a moment accept the character of the records to be the same as those of the Guptas; and if he did, he would find the reference to Vindhy\u0101\u015bakti in the Zodiac Cave inscription an immovable obstruction in his way. The conclusion, therefore, must follow that the inscriptions date from before the third century of the Christian era.\n\nThe three large inscriptions in Caves No. XVI. XVII. and XXV. refer to the excavation of the caves, and the caves must therefore be of the same age with the inscriptions. But the others are mere records of gifts, without any specification of their nature; and inscriptions of this class, I have elsewhere shown, belong to ages subsequent to the dates of the structures in which they occur. Thus the large engraved inscription on the doorway of the Cave No. XVI., being the record of its excavation, the painted records inside the cave announcing gifts (d\u0101na) must refer to something\n\n1 Buddha Gaya, the Hermitage of Saky\u0101 Muni, pp. 184, etc.\nelse given to the cave, or its presiding hermit, some time after the completion of the cave. Most of the small inscriptions are of this character; and their evidence amounts to this, that the caves existed from before, and were places of great sanctity, in which gifts were looked upon as highly meritorious; they do not necessarily fix the date of the cave. The L\u0101\u1e6d inscription in Cave No. XII. is a record of this description, and, therefore, the date of the cave must, according to this supposition, be older than the lowest limit of the L\u0101\u1e6d character.\n\nNotes on Babu R\u0101jendral\u0101la Mitra's Paper on the Age of the Caves at Ajant\u0101. By James Fergusson, V.P., D.C.L., F.R.S.\n\nWhen this paper was first presented to the Council in July last, I objected to its being received, inasmuch as it contained a vast amount of irrelevant matter, and personalities, which I should regret to see introduced into any discussion in this Society. Since then Mr. Grote, in the exercise of a discretion given him by the author, has cut it down to about one-half its original length, and now presents it in a form to which I personally can have no possible objection. I would only, however, like to observe, that the title now given to it is a little misleading. It would hardly be worth while, if an attempt to fix their dates were all the paper contained, to print a disquisition on the age of the Caves at Ajant\u0101 by a person who has never visited them, and who, though eminent as a Sanskrit scholar, has hitherto shown no aptitude for, or knowledge of, archaeological subjects. It seems too singularly inappropriate at the present moment, as a quarto volume, containing 111 closely printed pages, with numerous illustrations, has just been presented to the Society, by its author, Mr. Burgess. This volume is the result of several weeks spent in examining the Caves at Ajant\u0101 last cold weather, and was, I believe, his fourth or fifth visit to them during the\nlast ten or twelve years. During that interval he has visited almost every series of caves in Western India. Babu R\u00e1jendra has not seen this work, and it is consequently not clear how far Mr. Burgess's intimate knowledge of the subject might have modified his views. For the benefit of those who have not seen it, I may mention that we are perfectly in accord as to the dates of the caves belonging to this group, and he has left me an almost equally extensive account of them to be embodied in a work I am now passing through the press, conjointly with him, and which I hope may appear in the spring.\n\nAll this, however, is of very little importance at the present moment, as Babu R\u00e1jendral\u00e1la Mitra's paper is not what its title imports, but is, practically, an attempt to prove\u2014\n\nFirst, that I am wrong in the date I assign (A.D. 600 to 640) to Cave No. I. at Ajant\u00e1, which contains certain pictures avowedly admitted to be those of foreigners.\n\nSecondly, that I am equally wrong in believing that these pictures contain portraits of Kh\u00fbshr\u00fa Parviz of Persia, and Pulak\u00e9s\u00ed, King of Mah\u00e2r\u00e2shtra.\n\nBoth these propositions are stated with unobjectionable fairness in the paper as it now stands, and are not only perfectly legitimate subjects for discussion, but are, I believe, of sufficient interest to be well worthy of the attention of this Society.\n\nTo these two points, and to them only, I shall confine the remarks I have to make; but before doing so, it will add to the clearness of what follows, if I make a few observations on the long extract the Babu makes from his unpublished second volume of \"The Antiquities of Orissa.\"\n\nIn this passage, and elsewhere, he represents me as inventing a system of \"gradual improvement,\" \"according to which the simplest caves are assigned to the earliest period, the most ornate to a comparatively recent date;\" and he proceeds to illustrate this by various very irrelevant examples. As this proposition is stated here, I cannot object to its form, but I beg leave to state, most emphatically, that I have done nothing of the kind, and that it is founded on\nan entire misconception of my meaning. What I have attempted to do during the last forty years has been to apply to Indian architecture the same principles of archeological science, which are universally adopted, not only in England, but in every country in Europe. Since the publication of Rickman's \"Attempt to Discriminate Styles, etc.,\" in 1817, style has been allowed to supersede all other evidence for the age of any building, not only in Medi\u00e6val, but in Byzantine, Classical, and, in fact, all other true styles. Any accomplished antiquary, looking at any archway or any moulding, can say at once, this is Norman, or Early English, or Decorated, or Tudor, and if familiar with the style, tell the date within a few years, whether it belongs to a cathedral, or a parish church, a dwelling house, or a grange; whether it is part of the most elaborate shrine, or of a pigsty\u2014is not of the smallest consequence, nor whether it belongs to the marvellously elaborate quasi-Byzantine style of the age of the Conqueror, or to the prosaic tameness of that of the age of Elizabeth.\n\nOwing to its perfect originality and freedom from all foreign admixture or influence, I believe these principles, so universally adopted in this country, are even more applicable to the Indian styles than to the European. During the half century during which I have been occupied in the matter, I have found no exception to their applicability, though frequently in the very inverse sense from that the Babu represents me as adopting. The Rails at Buddha Gaya, and Bharhut, and the Caves at Udayagiri, and Pitalkhora, are among the oldest, the most elaborate, and most ornate specimens of art yet discovered, but these were succeeded by many of almost Doric simplicity.\u00b9 As it\n\n\u00b9 It is hardly worth while saying much about the argument derived from the \"Pillars,\" which the Babu would never have brought forward, had he ever visited the Western Caves, or even studied their plans. In the West of India, the Hall is the most prominent and most essential feature, and into it all the cells open. Consequently, when these became numerous, and the hall necessarily large, pillars became indispensable to support the roof, which otherwise would have fallen in, and eventually they became a most important feature. In Orissa, on the contrary, all the cells open on the outer air, and their doors are only covered by shallow verandahs, and there are no halls in which internal pillars\nhappens, it is quite true that the earliest Caves at Ajant\u0101, and generally in the West, are the plainest and least ornamented, but that is not a consequence of their age, but because they belonged to a sect remarkable for its puritanical asceticism. On the Eastern side of India, the conditions were reversed. At Buddha Gaya, Bharhut, and Udayagiri, the contemporary structures, if not the most richly ornamented, were at least as much so, as any that succeeded them. In fact, in so far as anything I have ever written on the subject is concerned, there is not one single paragraph in any work of mine that can be tortured into the expression of a belief, on my part, that greater or less richness of ornamentation is a test of age. Style is a test, and by style alone can their age be ascertained.\n\nI believe I am tolerably familiar with all that Babu R\u00e1jendra has written on arch\u00e6ological subjects; but I have not yet found one paragraph in any of his works in which he shows that he ever heard of the science of Arch\u00e6ology, as it is understood in Europe, nor certainly one instance in which he has applied its principles to ascertain either the relative, or positive, age of any building. He is, in fact, in the exact position of the antiquaries of the last century, puzzling over inscriptions, or annals, or traditions; but having no knowledge of style nor any certain guide, and consequently tumbling into mistakes only calculated to excite wonder and amusement in the present generation of antiquaries.\n\nAt the same time, I am far from either rejecting or undervaluing the assistance gained in all these researches from the study of Pal\u00e6ography. It is always a help, and frequently a guide, which is in some instances indispensable; but it never\u2014so far as I can judge\u2014is capable of the same precision, nor can be so implicitly relied upon as Arch\u00e6ology, when this is properly understood and applied. I do, however, object\n\ncould possibly be introduced. There is, in fact, no analogy between the disposition of the caves in the East and those in the West. I need hardly, however, attempt to explain here in what the difference consists, as in the book on the subject I have in the press, conjointly with Mr. Burgesse, the subject will be fully entered into.\nto Prinsep's alphabets being used as an argument in the present discussion. We have made immense progress during the last forty years in our knowledge of the alphabets of India, and Prinsep only knew of that used in these caves from some fragments copied by gentlemen who neither knew the letters nor the language, and whose copies are consequently of the least possible value.\n\nAs I hope to show presently, the evidence derived from the inscriptions in these Caves is in perfect accord with what we learn from their architecture, as must indeed always be the case, when there exists sufficient means of comparing them together. In the present instance, I feel confident, that when the evidence derived from inscriptions is added to that deduced from the style in which the caves are decorated, the two, taken together, will be more than sufficient to prove that I was not mistaken in the date I assigned to Cave No. I.\n\nIn order to state his case more clearly, Babu Rajendra has divided the Caves at Ajant\u00e1 into three groups. About the first there is no dispute. In the paper read to this Society in 1842, I stated that they all were excavated before the Christian Era, which the Babu admits. They are, however, interesting as showing how superior the Archaeological method is to the Palaeographical. Because, he says, they have all inscriptions in the L\u00e2t character, he argues that they must all be of one age\u2014or very nearly so\u2014though what that age is he does not venture to specify. Now, I defy any architect or antiquary to look at them without seeing at a glance that they are not all of the same age, that there is a succession, and a considerable interval must have elapsed between the earliest and the latest; and had he ever seen them, or known anything of archaeology, even he must have admitted it was so. IX. and X., for instance, are Chaitya Caves, situated side by side, but so different, in every essential respect, as to prove that they belong to different ages. If their inscriptions\n\n1 Journ. Asiatic Soc. Bengal, vol. v. plates ix. and xxix.\nwere all in the same character, it would only show how worthless Palaeography is for the purpose to which the Babu applies it; but the fact of the matter is, there are only two short inscriptions in the four caves which can, even by courtesy, be called \"in the L\u0101\u1e6d character,\" and they are in its most modern form, and certainly not of the same age.\u00b9 This, however, is of little consequence here, as the group has absolutely no bearing on the age of Cave No. I.\n\nThe Babu's second group is very extensive, and arranged in a manner that passes my comprehension; but that, too, is of no consequence, as not bearing on the argument, nor has the accustomed inaccuracy with which they are described. I would, however, remark that Cave VIII. is not a \"Chaitya,\" but one of the meanest Viharas in the place, and has no \"inscription,\" and \"no painted Buddha over the entrance;\" Cave VI. has neither the one nor the other; and Cave XVI. is not the Zodiac cave; this last, however, is a mistake of Bhau Daji's, for which the Babu is not responsible. All this, however, is only what might be expected from any one writing on a subject of which he has no special knowledge. There are, however, two Caves in this group, XVI. and XVII.,\u00b2 which have important inscriptions, which, with their architectural peculiarities, bear directly on the subject in hand, and regarding which, I should consequently like to say a few words.\n\nCave No. XVI. contains an important inscription of the Vindhy\u0101\u015bakti dynasty (J.B.B.R.A.S., vol. vii. p. 56), which I would like any one to compare with the Seoni plates of the same dynasty (J.A.S.B., vol. v. pl. xxxiii.). The alphabet is the same, but the form of characters is so different, that it would be competent to any one to argue that there was\u2014on pal\u00e6ographic evidence\u201450 or 100\n\n\u00b9 Journ. Asiat. Soc. Bengal, vol. vii. inscriptions 1 and 2, on the third plate of Bhau Daji's paper, p. 63.\n\u00b2 Woodcuts of the interior of these two caves will be found in my Eastern and Indian Architecture, woodcuts 84, 85, and 86, and lithographic representations of them, plates iv. and v. of my Rock Temples, folio, London, 1846.\nyears between them, one way or the other. But even that does not concern us here, its direct bearing is only to show that it is anterior, probably to the extent of 50 or 100 years, to the inscription in the Zodiac Cave No. XVII. That inscription is most important for our present argument, because, when Bhau Daji's copy is compared with Mr. Burgess's photograph of that on Cave No. III. at Badami (Reports, vol. i. pl. xxxii.), they are found to be practically identical, in so far as the palaeographical evidence is concerned. The alphabet, and the form of the letters, are the same, with only such differences as may arise from the one being an eye copy, the other an 'estampage,' and the geographical distance being 400 miles may also account for some slight differences; but it would require a very keen and practised eye to detect any of importance, or to say which is the oldest of the two. Now the great and cardinal fact is that the Badami inscription contains a date, \"500 years from the Coronation of the Saka King,\" or in other words 578-9 A.D.\n\nThis Badami date is by far the most important discovery that has been made of late years for fixing the chronology of the architecture of the period. It is the cardinal point on which every discussion must hinge. Any attempt to fix the date of any cave without taking it into account is worthless. We know exactly what the form of the character is in which it is written, and we know exactly what the architecture of the cave is in which it is found (Burgess, Reports, vol. i. plates xxiv. to xxxv.), and are consequently able to say what was before and what came after it; and with this knowledge I have no hesitation in asserting that Cave No. I. at Ajanta, is subsequent to Cave No. III. at Badami, consequently to A.D. 579. But it is just here that the argument between me and the Babu breaks down. He calls this an \"opinion of mine.\" It is just such an opinion, however,\n\n---\n\n1 I pointed out the value of this date in my original paper (Vol. XI. p. 160), but the Babu has an unpleasant habit of passing over \"sub silentio\" any facts that militate against his theories. Had he realized its importance, this paper would probably never have been written.\nas that I have formed that Henry the Seventh's Chapel is more modern than Westminster Abbey, or such as I would form, if any example of Tudor architecture were pointed out to me, and I were asked its age relatively to any example of the Edwardian Gothic. The Babu does not see this, because he never heard of styles being so used, and we cannot of course come to an understanding regarding it, because one of us is speaking in a language the other does not understand. What the exact interval between the two cases may be, it is not so easy to determine, but certainly not less than twenty or thirty years.\n\nMr. Burgess (p. 57) dates Cave XVI. at about A.D. 500, in which he is probably correct; but the difference in the architecture and the alphabet of Cave XVII. is so great that we can hardly allow less than seventy or eighty years; thus on pal\u00e6ographical and archaeological grounds bringing it abreast of Cave III. at Badami. But assuming this, the progress of the style of Cave I. is so great that it is difficult to believe that it could be accomplished within the thirty years the above theory assumes. The real difficulty is to get all one requires into the space. Probably by putting XVII. back some ten or fifteen years, and No. I. forward to a like extent, we may arrive more nearly at the exact truth. The paintings may have been\u2014and probably were\u2014executed some time after the events they were designed to represent.\n\nAnother point that tends to determine the age of this cave with tolerable precision is its position in the group. It certainly, from its locality, is the last excavated at that end of the series, and when we compare it with those next before it, and those opposite, at the other end, it seems impossible to escape the conviction that we are very near the age when cave-digging ceased to be the fashion, which, from various circumstances too long to enter upon here, we may assume to have been about 650 to 675 A.D.\n\nAs the Babu has so strong a leaning to pal\u00e6ographic evidence, which he \"considers much more authentic and less misleading, than\"\u2014what he is pleased to call\u2014\"aesthetic tests,\" it is a pity there is no important inscription in\nCave No. I. by which he could test the value of his theories. It is true he says, \"No. I. has more than one painted inscription of the same character as the preceding group.\" Where are they to be found? I saw none, and I examined the cave with considerable attention. Dr. Bird saw none. Mr. Burgess devoted twenty-three closely printed quarto pages to the description of this cave, but mentions none. It is true, however, that Dr. Bhau Daji on his third plate, p. 64, huddles together some eight or nine insignificant inscriptions, which he describes as \"painted inscriptions on Caves Nos. I. II. and X.\"; but which is in No. I., which in No. II., and which in No. X. he does not specify. As engraved they are all so much alike that, if they prove anything, it would be, that No. X., avowedly before the Christian era, was of the same age as Nos. I. and II., which are avowedly long after it, or vice versed. If the Babu knows which belongs to Cave No. I., he ought to say so; or if he has any information not available to others, he ought to produce it. As the case at present stands, there is no palaeographic evidence to show in the remotest degree what the age of this cave is, and certainly nothing that in the smallest degree invalidates the conclusions arrived at, from the style of the architecture, or that of its paintings and sculpture, which prove beyond a shadow of doubt, so far as I am capable of judging, that it was excavated in the first half of the seventh century of our era.\n\nThe second part of the task I have undertaken is infinitely more difficult than the first. Not that I think there is anything in the Babu's criticism that in the smallest degree invalidates what I advanced in my original paper; but the class of objections he puts forward are from their nature so indefinite, that it is almost impossible to return answers which will prove satisfactory. With the caves we had something tangible to go upon; but when it comes to questions of costume or likeness, or probabilities whether one or\n\n---\n\n1 Since the above was in type, I have received from Mr. Burgess a letter dated Lanouli, 29th November, in which he says, in answer to my telegraphic inquiry, \"There is no inscription, in Cave No. I. at Ajantd, either cut or painted.\"\ntwo embassies took place, or other events happened, we are \nseriously at a wide sea, from which it would require both \nskill and judgment to reach a port. When we venture into \nthe vast region of the politics of Persia and India in the \npresent century, we must not look for a precision that would \nrequire a conveyancer in Lincoln's Inn, and unless prepared \nto take a large and liberal view of matters, it would be \nbetter to leave them alone. Under such circumstances as we \nfind them existing, there is nothing so easy as to express \njudgment and demand explanations. And, after all, such carping \ncriticisms seldom lead to anything, and are generally con-\nnected to anonymous writers in third-class periodicals. They \nare so easy when there is no responsibility to produce some-\nthing better. I cannot call to mind any instance of their \nbeing admitted into the publications of any scientific or \nliterary society, unless it is to clear the space for the erection \nof some better structure, which is certainly not the case in \nthis instance. However, as the Babu's lucubrations have \nbeen printed in our Journal, I must say a few words, lest \notherwise judgment may go against me by default.\n\nFirst with regard to the name Pulak\u00e8i. It was no inven-\ntion of mine\u2014it was suggested by Professor N\u00f6ldeke, who is, \nif not the best, at least one of the best Arabic scholars in \nEurope. It is no answer to him to repeat the various possible \nreadings which he himself suggested, but rejected, after due \nconsideration, in favour of the one he adopted. To this the Babu \nobjects, as a matter of course\u2014any one can do that; but has \nhe anything to suggest in its place? If he has, he had better \nput it before the Professor, who, I have no doubt, will give \nhim a reply. I hope it will not be such a crushing one as he \nreceived from Prof. Weber in the Academy of Nov. 15, 1879.\n\nThe giving of nicknames is a very ingenious device, a \ngood deal resorted to in certain pleadings in some courts not \nin very high order; but never, so far as I know, in earnest \nscientific discussions. To call the principal person, in the so-\ncalled drinking scene, a \"Bacchanal,\" certainly diverts the \nattention from the idea of his being a person of consequence; \nbut it leaves untouched the question, why, being a foreigner\n(Persian), his portrait appears four times as the principal person in the four most important points of the roof of a Buddhist Vihara in India. If he was only a Bacchanal, this seems to me strange.\n\nIn like manner, to call the messenger delivering a letter to the King, in the \"Court scene\" \"The Ambassador,\" diverts attention from the fact that there are at least half a dozen ambassadors of the same rank in the place, and with their horses held outside. They are, in fact, grooms, or at least horsemen, of some sort, bringing a letter with the usual nuzzurana, from some king or potentate to some other, whoever he may be. They have no costume or state, nor any attendance that would lead any one to suspect that they were in any sense the representatives of the King who sent them.\n\nThe Babu cannot see any likeness in feature or costume between the Bacchanal and the Ambassadors. Nor can I. But I would not be distressed if I could not trace much likeness between the face of George the Fourth, as painted by Sir Thomas Lawrence, and that of a foreign office messenger, who arrived at the court of a foreign prince, after a long journey on horseback, wearied and travel-stained, in the costume of his profession. Nor would I be more surprised to find the state costume of Kh\u00fbshr\u00fb and Shir\u00een at Takht-i-Bostan did not resemble those of the Bacchanal, than I would be to find that the costume of any king and queen, in their robes of state, differed considerably from that they adopted when retired to their private apartments, and put on their dressing gowns and slippers. Surely such questions as these are not worthy of being treated seriously by grown-up men.\n\nThere is, however, one question which is perfectly legitimate, and which the Babu takes up in a proper spirit, and supports with sufficient references. It is that of the crimped streamers, or Banderoles, which I believed, and believe, belong exclusively to the Sassanian period. As Wilson's Ariana Antiqua is accessible to any one, it is easy to judge whether I am correct in asserting that the fillets in the first five\nplates referred to, are only the ordinary Greek or Roman fillets usual on classical coins and statues. As we get near the Sassanian period (Plates IX. to XII) they get longer; but there are no true \"crimped banderoles,\" such as are found on all the Sassanian sculptures in Persia, till we reach Plate VII., where the Sassanian coins begin.\n\nThe works of Ker Porter, of Texier, and Flandin and those, are equally accessible, and if any one will take the trouble to study them, and realize what a true Sassanian crimped banderole is, as portrayed everywhere in Persia, I have no doubt that he will arrive at the conclusion that it is found only on Sassanian sculptures, Sassanian coins, and on the roof of Cave No. I. at Ajant\u00e1.\n\nIt surely can hardly be worth while noticing the objection that, as in Tabari there is \"no allusion to a return embassy,\" the inference should be, that this very Irish correspondence began and ended with a single letter in one direction. As I read it, the whole context in Tabari shows that the relations between the Persian and Indian kings must have been long and intimate, and that many letters must have passed to and fro before such an incident could have occurred, as the one thus almost accidentally brought to our notice.\n\nI have now, I hope, said enough to prove\u2014what appears to me one of the most incontestable facts in the Cave Chronology of India\u2014that Cave No. I. at Ajant\u00e1 was excavated in the first half of the seventh century, and that consequently the paintings on the roof and walls cannot represent \"Phases of Indian life 1800 to 2000 years ago,\" as Babu Rajendra persists in maintaining.\n\nIf this is so, it seems impossible that the persons represented on the paintings in the Cave can be either Bactrians or Assyrians\u2014as these terms are usually understood, and there is nothing, so far as I can judge, in his paper to invalidate the conclusion I have arrived at that the figures on the roof do represent Kh\u00fbshhr\u00fa and Shrir\u00edn, and the \"Court scene\" on the walls, the delivery of a letter from that Persian Monarch to Pulaktei, King of Mah\u00e2r\u00e2shtra.\nIf these propositions are granted, I am quite willing to accept his conclusion, that \"the intercourse between the Indians on the one hand, and the Persians, the Assyrians, and the Egyptians on the other, was probably more frequent in past times than it is now.\" But I would only ask, was the magniloquent announcement of such a truism worth all the pains and paper it has cost to bring it before the world? With regard to the long-extinct kingdoms of Egypt and Assyria, it is no doubt absolutely true; and with regard to Persia, it is a testimony in favour of the views I have just had the honour of laying before the Society, which I willingly accept.\nART. VI.\u2014On Sanskrit Texts Discovered in Japan. By Professor F. Max M\u00fcller.\n\nIt is probably in the recollection of some of the senior members of this Society how wide and deep an interest was excited in the year 1853 by the publication of Stanislas Julien's translation of the Life and Travels of Hiouen-thsang. The account given by an eye-witness of the religious, social, political, and literary state of India at the beginning of the seventh century of our era was like a rocket, carrying a rope to a whole crew of struggling scholars, on the point of being drowned in the sea of Indian chronology; and the rope was eagerly grasped by all, whether their special object was the history of Indian religion, or the history of Indian literature, architecture, or politics. While many books on Indian literature, published five-and-twenty years ago, are now put aside and forgotten, Julien's three volumes of Hiouen-thsang still maintain a fresh interest, and supply new subjects for discussion, as may be seen even in the last number of the Journal of your Society.\n\nI had the honour and pleasure of working with Stanislas Julien, when he was compiling those large lists of Sanskrit and Chinese words which formed the foundation of his translation of Hiouen-thsang, and enabled him in his classical work, the *M\u00e9thode pour d\u00e9chiffrer et transcrire les noms Sanscrits* (1861), to solve a riddle which had puzzled Oriental scholars for a long time, viz. how it happened that the original\nSanskrit names had been so completely disguised and rendered almost unrecognizable in the Chinese translations of Sanskrit texts, and how they could be restored to their original form.\n\nI had likewise the honour and pleasure of working with your late President, Professor H. H. Wilson, when, after reading Julien's works, he conceived the idea that some of the original Sanskrit texts of which the Chinese translations had been recovered might still be found in the monasteries of China. His influential position as President of your Society, and his personal relations with Sir John Bowring, then English Resident in China, enabled him to set in motion a powerful machinery for attaining his object; and if you look back some five-and-twenty years, you will find in your Journal a full account of the correspondence that passed between Professor Wilson, Sir J. Bowring, and Dr. Edkins, on the search after Sanskrit MSS. in the temples or monasteries of China.\n\nOn the 15th February, 1854, Professor Wilson writes from Oxford to Sir John Bowring:\n\n\"I send you herewith a list of the Sanskrit works carried to China by Hwen Tsang in the middle of the seventh century, and in great part translated by him, or under his supervision, into Chinese. If any of them, especially the originals, should be still in existence, you would do good service to Sanskrit literature and to the history of Buddhism, by procuring copies.\"\n\nIt is a well-known fact, that even long before the time of Hiouen-thsang, that is, long before the seventh century of our era, large numbers of Sanskrit MSS. had been exported to China. These literary exportations began as early as the first century A.D. When we read for the first time of Commissioners being sent to India by Ming-ti, the Emperor of China, the second sovereign of the Eastern Han dynasty, about 62 A.D., we are told that they returned to China with a white horse, carrying books and images.\u00b9 And the account\n\n\u00b9 Beal, Travels of Buddhist Pilgrims, Introd. p. xxi; Chinese Repository, vol. x. No. 3, March, 1841.\nproceeds to state that \"these books still remain, and are reverenced and worshipped.\"\n\nFrom that time, when Buddhism was first officially recognized in China, there is an almost unbroken succession of importers and translators of Buddhist, in some cases of Brahmanic texts also, till we come to the two famous expeditions, the one undertaken by Fa-Hian in 400\u2013415, the other by Hiouen-thsang, 629\u2013645 A.D. Fa-Hian's Travels were translated into French by Abel R\u00e9musat (1836), into English by Mr. Beal (1869). Hiouen-thsang's Travels are well known through Stanislas Julien's admirable translation. Of Hiouen-thsang we are told that he brought back from India no less than 520 fasciculi, or 657 separate works, which had to be carried by twenty-two horses.\n\nThe earliest translators we know are those who worked under the Emperor Ming-ti, 62 A.D., viz. K\u0101syapa Matanga (sometimes called K\u0101syamatanga), and Tsu-fah-lan (Gobharana?). They had brought with them some Buddhist books of great importance. Their best known work is \"The S\u016btra of the 42 Sections,\" a kind of epitome of the Buddhist religion. Whether such a work ever existed either in Sanskrit or P\u0101li is extremely doubtful, and many difficulties would be removed, if we admitted, with M. Feer, that this so-called S\u016btra of the 42 Sections was really the work of K\u0101syapa Matanga and Gobharana themselves, who considered such an epitome of Buddhist doctrines, based on original texts, useful for their new converts in China. They translated, however, the Dasabh\u016bmi-S\u016btra, and the Lalita-Vistara, the legendary Life of Buddha (called Fo-pen-hing-king), and their translations enable us to assign to these works in Sanskrit a date prior to the beginning of our era.\n\n---\n\n1 See an account of the Introduction of Buddhism into China, in Journal Asiatique, 1858, August, p. 105.

It would have enabled us to see what the Life of Buddha was in the first century of the Christian era.\nIn 150 A.D. we hear of a famous translator, An-shi-kau, a native of Eastern Persia or Parthia, whose translations are still in existence. Mr. Wylie considers Ansik to represent an original Arsak, and as An-shi-kau is reported to have been a royal prince, who made himself a mendicant and travelled to China, Mr. Wylie supposes that he was the son of one of the Arsacidae, Kings of Persia. Mr. Beal takes the name for a corruption of Asvaka or Assaka, \u1f08\u03c3\u03c0\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2.\n\nIn about 170 A.D. Chi-tsin is mentioned as the translator of the Nirv\u0101na-S\u016btra.\n\nIn 250 A.D. Chi-mang translated the \"Rules of the Priesthood\" from a MS. which is said to have come from the city of P\u0101li-putra (Patna).\n\nIn 260 A.D. Dharma-raksha, in Chinese Fa-hou, made a large collection of Buddhist and Brahmanic books, and with the help of other Shamans, is said to have translated no less than 165 texts, between the years 265\u2013308. Among them there is a new version of the Lalita-Vistara (Pou-yao-king), which is in existence, a corrected translation of the Nirv\u0101na-s\u016btra, and the Suvarnaprabh\u0101-s\u016btra.\n\nIn 300 A.D. mention is made of a translation of the Vimalakirti-s\u016btra (?), and the Saddharma pundarika (Fa-hwa).\n\nThis brings us to the times of the Emperor Yao-hsing (397\u2013415), whose devotion to Buddhism induced him to secure the services of the learned translator Kum\u0101ragu\u1e47a, and to send Fa-Hian to India to collect MSS.\n\nIn 460 A.D. we read of five Buddhists arriving in China from Ceylon by way of Tibet. These no doubt brought P\u0101li MSS. with them. Bodhidharma, too, the twenty-eighth Buddhist Patriarch, came from the South in 526 A.D., though not from Ceylon.\n\nIn 518, the famous traveller Sun-Yun was sent to India by the Queen Dowager of the Wei country in search of Buddhist books, and we gather from his Travels, which have been translated by Mr. Beal, that, after three years spent in\n\n---\n\n1 See Journal of R.A.S. 1856, pp. 327, 332.\n2 Beal, l.c. p. xxiii.\n3 Beal, l.c. p. xxxiii.\nIndia, he returned to China with 175 volumes. During the Siu Dynasty, 589-619, the number of distinct Buddhist books translated into Chinese is said to have amounted to 1950.\\(^1\\)\n\nThat number was considerably increased afterwards, particularly by the famous Buddhist pilgrim Hiouen-thsang, who is said to have translated 740 works, forming 1335 books.\n\nIt was the publication of Hiouen-thsang's Travels, which roused the hopes of Professor Wilson that some of the old Sanskrit MSS. might still be discovered in China.\n\nBut though no pains were spared by Sir John Bowring to carry out Prof. Wilson's wishes, though he had catalogues sent to him from Buddhist libraries, and from cities where Buddhist compositions might be expected to exist, the results were disappointing, at least so far as Sanskrit texts were concerned. A number of interesting Chinese books, translated from Sanskrit by Hiouen-thsang and others, works also by native Chinese Buddhists, were sent to the library of the East India House; but what Professor Wilson and all Sanskrit scholars with him most desired, Sanskrit MSS., or copies of Sanskrit MSS., were not forthcoming. Professor Wilson showed me indeed one copy of a Sanskrit MS. that was sent to him from China, and, so far as I remember, it was the K\u0101la-Kakra,\\(^2\\) which we know as one of the books translated from Sanskrit into Chinese. That MS., however, is no longer to be found in the India Office Library, though it certainly existed in the old East India House.\n\nThe disappointment at the failure of Professor Wilson's and Sir J. Bowring's united efforts was felt all the more keenly because neither Sanskrit nor Chinese scholars could surrender the conviction that, until a very short time since, Indian MSS. had existed in China. They had been seen by Europeans, such as Dr. Gutzlaff, the hard-working mis-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) A long list of Sanskrit texts translated into Chinese may be found in the Journal Asiatique, 1849, p. 353, seq., s.t.

Journal Asiatique, 1849, p. 356.\nsionary in China, who in a paper, written shortly before his death, and addressed to Colonel Sykes (Journal R.A.S. 1856, p. 73), stated that he himself had seen P\u0101li MSS. preserved by Buddhist priests in China. Whether these MSS. were in P\u0101li or Sanskrit would matter little, supposing even that Dr. Gutzlaff could not distinguish between the two. He speaks with great contempt of the whole Buddhist literature. There was not a single priest, he says, capable of explaining the meaning of the P\u0101li texts, though some were interlined with Chinese. \"A few works,\" he writes, \"are found in a character originally used for writing the P\u0101li; and may be considered as faithful transcripts of the earliest writings of Buddhism. They are looked upon as very sacred, full of mysteries, and deep significations; and therefore as the most precious relics of the founder of their creed. With the letters of this alphabet the priests perform incantations\\(^1\\) to expel demons, rescue souls from hell, bring down rain on the earth, remove calamities, etc. They turn and twist them in every shape, and maintain that the very demons tremble at the recitation of them.\"\n\nThis may account for the unwillingness of the priests to part with their old MSS., whether Sanskrit or P\u0101li, but it proves at the same time that they still exist, and naturally keeps up the hope that some day or other we may still get a sight of them.\n\nOf course, it might be said that if MSS. did not last very long in India, neither would they do so in China. But even then, we might expect at least, that as in India the old MSS. were copied whenever they showed signs of decay, so they would have been in China. Besides, the climate of China is not so destructive as the heat and moisture of the climate of India. In India, MSS. seldom last over a thousand years. Long before that time paper made of vegetable substances decays, palm leaves and birch bark become brittle, and white ants often destroy what might have escaped the ravages of the climate. It was the duty, therefore, of Indian Rajahs to keep\n\n\\(^1\\) cf. Deal, Catalogue, p. 66.\na staff of librarians, who had to copy the old MSS. whenever they began to seem unsafe, a fact which accounts both for the modern date of most of our Sanskrit MSS. and for the large number of copies of the same text often met with in the same library.\n\nThe MSS. carried off to China were in all likelihood not written on paper, or whatever we like to call the material which Nearchus describes 'as cotton well beaten together,' but on the bark of the birch tree or on palm leaves. The bark of trees is mentioned as a writing material used in India by Curtius; and in Buddhist Sutras, such as the Karandavy\u016bha (p. 69), we actually read of bh\u016brga, birch, m\u0101si, ink, and karama (kalam), as the common requisites for writing. MSS. written on that material have long been known in Europe, chiefly as curiosities (I had to write many years ago about one of them, preserved in the Library of All Souls' College). Of late, however, they have attracted more serious attention, particularly since Dr. B\u00fchler discovered in Kashmir old MSS. containing independent recensions of Vedic texts, written on birch bark. One of these, containing the whole text of the Rig Veda Samhita with accents, was sent to me, and though it had suffered a good deal, particularly on the margins, it shows that there was no difficulty in producing from the bark of the birch tree thousands and thousands of pages of the largest quarto or even folio size, perfectly smooth and pure, except for the small dark lines peculiar to the bark of that tree.\n\nAt the time of Hiouen-thsang, in the seventh century, palm leaves seem to have been the chief material for writing. He mentions a forest of palm trees (Borassus flabelliformis) near Konkaumpura (the Western coast of the Dekhan), which was much prized on account of its supplying material for writing (vol. i. p. 202, and vol. iii. p. 148). At a later time, too, in 965, we read of Buddhist priests returning to\n\n---\n\n1 The modern paper in Nepal is said to date from 500 years ago.

If we can believe Hiouen-thsang, the palm leaf was used even so early as the first Buddhist Council, for he says that Kasyapa then wrote the Pitakas on palm leaves and spread them over the whole of India. In the Pali Canon, peito is used in the sense of letter, but originally peito meant a wing, then a leaf of a tree, then a leaf for writing. Peito, also, which is used in the sense of a sheet, was originally peito, a wing, a leaf of a tree. Such MSS., written on palm leaves, if preserved carefully and almost worshipped, as they seem to have been in China, might still survive to the present day, and they would certainly prove of immense value to the students of Buddhism, if they could still be recovered, whether in the original or even in later copies.\n\nBeing myself convinced of the existence of old Indian MSS. in China, I had no opportunity, during the last five-and-twenty years, of asking any friends of mine who went to China to look out for these treasures, but\u2014without result! Some years ago, however, Dr. Edkins, who had taken an active part in the search instituted by Prof. Wilson and Sir J. Needham, showed me a book which he had brought from Japan, and which contained a Chinese vocabulary with Sanskrit equivalents and a transliteration in Japanese. The Sanskrit is written in that peculiar alphabet which we find in the old MSS. of Nepal, and which in China has been further modified so as to give it an almost Chinese appearance.\n\nThis MSS. revived my hopes. If such a book was published in Japan, I concluded that there must have been a time when such a book was useful there, that is to say, when the Buddhists in Japan studied Sanskrit. Dr. Edkins kindly\nSPECIMEN PAGE OF THE JAPANESE EDITION OF THE SUKHAVAT\u012aV\u016aHA-S\u016aTRA.\nleft the book with me, and though the Sanskrit portion was full of blunders, yet it enabled me to become accustomed to that peculiar alphabet in which the Sanskrit words are written.\n\nWhile I was looking forward to more information from Japan, good luck would have it that a young Buddhist priest, Mr. Bunyiu Nanjio, came to me from Japan, in order to learn Sanskrit and P\u0101li, and thus to be able in time to read the sacred writings of the Buddhists in their original language, and to compare them with the Chinese and Japanese translations, now current in his country. After a time, another Buddhist priest, Mr. Kasawara, came to me for the same purpose, and both are now working very hard at learning Sanskrit. Japan is supposed to contain 34,388,300 inhabitants, all of whom, with the exception of about 100,000 followers of Shint\u014d, are Buddhists, divided into ten principal sects, the sect to which Mr. Bunyiu Nanjio belongs being that of the Shinshiu. One of the first questions which I asked Mr. Bunyiu Nanjio, when he came to read Sanskrit with me, was about Sanskrit MSS. in Japan. I showed him the Chinese-Sanskrit-Japanese Vocabulary which Dr. Edkins had left with me, and he soon admitted that Sanskrit texts in the same alphabet might be found in Japan, or, at all events, in China. He wrote home to his friends, and, after waiting for some time, he brought me in December last a book which a Japanese scholar, Shuntai Ishikawa, had sent to me, and which he wished me to correct, and then to send back to him to Japan. I did not see at once the importance of the book. But when I came to read the introductory formula, Evam may\u0101 sratam, 'Thus by me it has been heard,' the typical beginning of the Buddhist S\u016btras, I was delighted indeed. Here then was what I had so long been looking forward to\u2014a Sanskrit text, carried from India to China, from China to Japan, written in the peculiar Nepalese alphabet, with a Chinese translation, and a transliteration in Japanese. Of course, it is a copy only, not an original MS., but copies presuppose originals at some time or other, and, such as it is, it is a first instalment, which tells us that we ought not\nto despair, for where one of the long-sought-for literary treasures that were taken from India to China, and afterwards from China to Japan, has been discovered, others are sure to come to light.\n\nWe do not possess yet very authentic information on the ancient history of Japan, and on the introduction of Buddhism into that island. M. L\u00e9on de Rosny,\u00b9 and the Marquis D'Hervey de Saint-Deny,\u00b2 have given us some information on the subject, and I hope that Mr. Bunyiu Nanjio will soon give us a trustworthy account of the ancient history of his country, drawn from native authorities. What is told us about the conversion of Japan to Buddhism has a somewhat legendary aspect, and I shall only select a few of the more important facts, as they have been communicated to me by my Sanskrit pupil. Buddhism first reached Japan, not directly from China, but from Corea, which had been converted to Buddhism in the fourth century A.D. In the year 200 A.D., Corea had been conquered by the Japanese Empress Zingu, and the intercourse thus established between the two countries led to the importation of Buddhist doctrines from Corea to Japan. In the year 552 A.D. one of the Corean Kings sent a bronze statue of Buddha and many sacred books to the Court of Japan, and after various vicissitudes, Buddhism became the established religion of the island about 600 A.D. Japanese students were sent to China to study Buddhism, and they brought back with them large numbers of Buddhist books, chiefly translations from Sanskrit. In the year 640 A.D. we hear of a translation of the Sukhavativyuha-mahayana-sutra being read in Japan. This is the title of the Sanskrit text now sent to me from Japan. The translation had been made by K\u00f4 S\u00f4-gai, a native of Tibet, though living in India, 252 A.D., and we are told that there had been eleven other translations of the same text.\u00b3\n\nAmong the teachers of these Japanese students we find our\n\n\u00b9 Le Bouddhisme dans l'extr\u00eame Orient; Revue Scientifique, D\u00e9cembre, 1879.\n\u00b2 Journal Asiatique, 1871, p. 386 seq.\n\u00b3 Five of these translations were introduced into Japan, the others seem to have been lost in China. Hence the translations are spoken of as \"the five in existence and the seven missing.\"\nold friend Hionen-thsang, whom the Japanese call Genzi\u014d. In the year 653 a Japanese priest, Dosho by name, studied under Genzi\u014d, adopted the views of the sect founded by him, the Hoss\u014d sect, and brought back with him to Japan a compilation of commentaries on the thirty verses of Vasubandha, written by Dharmap\u0101la, and translated by Genzi\u014d. Two other priests, Chitsu and Chitatsu, likewise became his pupils, and introduced the famous Abhidharma-Kosha-s\u016btra into Japan, which had been composed by Vasubandha, and translated by Genzi\u014d. They seem to have favoured the Hina-y\u0101na, or the views of the Small Vehicle (Kushashin).\n\nIn the year 736 we hear of a translation of the Buddh\u0101vatamsaka-vai\u1e0d\u016brya-s\u016btra, by Buddhabhadra and others (317\u2013419 A.D.), being received in Japan; likewise of a translation of the Saddharmapu\u1e47\u1e0dar\u012bka by Kum\u0101ragu\u1e47a.\n\nAnd what is more important still, in the ninth century we are told that Kukai (died 835), the founder of the Shingon sect in Japan, was not only a good Chinese, but a good Sanskrit scholar also. Nay, one of his disciples, Shinnigo, in order to perfect his knowledge of Buddhist literature, undertook a journey not only to China, but to India, and died before he reached that country.\n\nThese short notices, which I owe chiefly to Mr. Bunyiu Nanjio, make it quite clear that we have every right to expect Sanskrit MSS., or, at all events, Sanskrit texts, in Japan, and the specimen which I have received encourages me to hope that some of these Sanskrit texts may be older than any which exist at present in any part of India.\n\nThe text which was sent to me bears the title of Sukh\u0101vat\u012bvy\u016bha-mah\u0101y\u0101na-s\u016btra.\u00b9\n\nThis is a title well known to all students of Buddhist literature. Burnouf, in his Introduction \u00e0 l'histoire du Buddhisme (pp. 99\u2013102),\u00b2 gave a short account of this S\u016btra, which enables us to see that the scene of the dialogue was laid at R\u0101gag\u1e5bha, and that the two speakers were Bhagavat and \u0100nanda.\n\n\u00b9 The MSS. vary between Sukhavati and Sukh\u0101vati,\n\u00b2 See also Lotus de la bonne Loi, p. 267.\nWe saw before, in the historical account of Buddhism in Japan, that no less than twelve Chinese translations of a work, bearing the same title, were mentioned. The Chinese tell us at least of five translations which are still in existence.\u00b9\n\nThose of the Han and Wu dynasties (168\u2013190 A.D.), we are told, were too diffuse, and those of the later periods, the T'ang and Sung dynasties, too literal. The best is said to be that by K\u00f4 S\u00f4-gai, a priest of Tibetan descent, which was made during the early Wei dynasty, about 252 A.D. This may be the same which was read in Japan in 640 A.D.\n\nThe same S\u00fbtra exists also in a Tibetan translation, for there can be little doubt that the S\u00fbtra, quoted by Cesoma K\u00f6r\u00f6si (As. Res. vol. xx. p. 408) under the name of Amit\u00e2bha-vy\u00fbha, is the same work. It occupies, as M. L\u00e9on Feer informs me, fifty-four leaves, places the scene of the dialogue at R\u00e2gagriha, on the mountain Gr\u00eedhra-k\u00fbta, and introduces Bhagavat and \u00c2nanda as the principal speakers.\n\nThere are Sanskrit MSS. of the Sukhavati-vy\u00fbha in your own Library, in Paris, at Cambridge, and at Oxford.\n\nThe following is a list of the MSS. of the Sukhavati-vy\u00fbha, hitherto known:\n\n1.)

While the text, as given in the ordinary Devan\u0101gar\u012b or Nepalese MSS., fills about fifty to sixty leaves, the text of the S\u016btra, that reached me from Japan, would hardly occupy more than eight or ten leaves.\n\nI soon convinced myself that this MS. was not a text abbreviated in Japan, for this shorter text, sent to me from Japan, corresponds in every respect with the Chinese S\u016btra, translated by Mr. Beal in his Catena, pp. 378\u2013383, and published in your Journal, 1866, p. 136. No doubt the Chinese translation, on which Mr. Beal\u2019s translation is based, is not only free, but displays the misapprehensions peculiar to many Chinese renderings of Sanskrit texts, due to a deficient knowledge\n\n\u00b9 I owe this information to the kindness of M. L\u00e9on Feer at Paris.\n\u00b2 See Journal Asiatique, 3rd series, vol. iii. p. 316; vol. iv. p. 298\u20138.\neither of Sanskrit or of Chinese on the part of the translators, perhaps also to the different genius of those two languages.\n\nYet, such as it is, there can be no doubt that it was meant to be a translation of the text now in my possession. Mr. Beal tells us that the translation he followed is that by Kum\u0101ragu\u1e47a, the contemporary of Fa-Hian (400 A.D.), and that this translator omitted repetitions and superfluities in the text.\u00b9 Mr. Edkins knows a translation, e.g., Wou-liang-sheu-king, made under the Han dynasty.\u00b2 What is important is that in the Chinese translation of the shorter text the scene is laid, as in the Japanese Sanskrit text, at Sr\u0101vasti, and the principal speakers are Bhagavat and \u015a\u0101riputra.\n\nThere is also a Tibetan translation of the short text, described by Csoma K\u00f6r\u00f6si (As. Res. vol. xx. p. 439). Here, though the name of the scene is not mentioned, the speakers are Bhagavat and \u015a\u0101riputra. The whole work occupies seven leaves only, and the names of the sixteen principal disciples agree with the Japanese text. The translators were Pragn\u0101varman, S\u016brendra, and the Tibetan Lotsava Ya-shes-sde.\n\nM. Feer informs me that there is at the National Library a Chinese text called O-mi-to-king, i.e. Amit\u0101bha-s\u016btra. The scene is at Sr\u0101vasti, the speakers are Bhagavat and \u015a\u0101riputra.\n\nAnother text at the National Library is called Ta-O-mi-to-king, i.e. Mah\u0101 Amit\u0101bha-s\u016btra, and here the scene is at R\u0101gag\u1e5bha.\n\nThere is besides, a third work, called Kwan-wou-liang-sheu-king, by Kiang-ling-ye-she, i.e. K\u0101layasas, a foreigner of the West, who lived in China about 425 A.D.\u00b3\n\n\u00b9 J.R.A.S. 1866, p. 136.\n\u00b2 J.R.A.S. 1866, p. 136.\n\u00b3 Beal, Catalogue, p. 23. J.R.A.S. 1856, p. 319. Beal, Catalogue, p. 77, mentions also an Amit\u0101bha-s\u016btra-upad\u0113sa-s\u0101stra, by Vasubandha, translated by Bodhiruci (Wou-liang-sheu-king-yeou-po-ti-she). There is an Amit\u0101bha S\u016btra, translated by Chi-Hien of the Wu period, i.e. 168\u2013190 A.D., mentioned in Mr. Beal's Catalogue of the Buddhist Tripitaka, p. 6. The next S\u016btra, which he calls the S\u016btra of measureless years, is no doubt the Amit\u0101yus-S\u016btra, Amit\u0101yus being another name for Amit\u0101bha (Fu-shwo-wou-liang-sheu-king, p. 6). See also Catalogue, pp. 99, 102.\nON SANSKRIT TEXTS DISCOVERED IN JAPAN.\n\nWe have, therefore, historical evidence of the existence of three S\u016btras, describing Sukhavati, or the Paradise of Amit\u0101bha. We know two of them in Sanskrit, Chinese, and Tibetan, one long, the other short. The third is known as yet in Chinese only.\n\nOf the two Sanskrit texts, the one from Nepal, the other from Japan, the latter seems certainly the earlier. But even the fuller text must have existed at a very early time, supposing that it was translated during the second century, or, at all events, before 220 A.D.\n\nThe shorter text is first authenticated through the translation of Kum\u0101ragu\u1e47a, about 400 A.D.; but if the views generally entertained as to the relative position of the longer and shorter S\u016btras be correct, we may safely claim for our short S\u016btra a date within the second century of our era.\n\nWhat Japan has sent us is, therefore, a Sanskrit text, of which we had no trace before, which must have left India at least before 400 A.D., but probably before 200 A.D., and which gives us the original of that description of Amit\u0101bha\u2019s Paradise, which formerly we knew in a Chinese translation only, which was neither complete nor correct.\n\nThe book sent to me was first published in Japan in 1773, by Zi\u014dmi\u014d, a Buddhist priest. The Sanskrit text is intelligible, but full of inaccuracies, showing clearly that the editor did not understand Sanskrit, but simply copied what he saw before him. The same words occurring in the same line are written differently, and the Japanese transliteration simply repeats the blunders of the Sanskrit transcript.\n\nThere are two other editions of the same text, published in 1794 A.D. by another Japanese priest, named H\u014dg\u014d. These are in the possession of Mr. Bunyiu Nanjio, and offered some help in correcting the text. One of them contains the text and three Chinese translations, one being merely a literal rendering, while the other two have more of a literary character and are ascribed to Kum\u0101ragu\u1e47a (A.D. 400), and Hiouen-thsang (A.D. 648).\n\nLastly, there is another book by the same H\u014dg\u014d, in 4 vols., in which an attempt is made to give a grammatical analysis\nof the text. This, however, as Mr. Bunyiu Nanjio informs me, is very imperfect.\n\nI have to-day brought with me the Japanese Sanskrit text, critically restored, and a literal translation into English, to which I have added a few notes.\n\n**Translation.**\n\nAdoration to the Omniscient.\n\nThis is what I have heard. At one time the Blessed (Bhagavat, i.e. Buddha) dwelt at Sr\u0101vasti, in the Geta-grove, in the garden of An\u0101thapindaka, together with a large company of Bhikshus (mendicants), viz. with thirteen hundred Bhikshus, all of them acquainted with the five kinds of knowledge, elders, great disciples, and Arhats, such as S\u0101riputra, the elder, Mah\u0101maudgaly\u0101yana, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, Mah\u0101kapphina, Mah\u0101k\u0101ty\u0101yana, Mah\u0101kaush\u0101thila, Revata, Sud\u012bpanthaka, Nanda, \u0100nanda, R\u0101hula, Gav\u0101mpati, Bharadv\u0101ga, K\u0101lodayin, Vakkula, and Aniruddha. He dwelt together with these and many other great disciples, and together with many noble-minded Bodhisattvas, such as Ma\u00f1ju\u015br\u012b, the prince, the Bodhisattva Agita, the Bodhisattva Gandhabhastin, the Bodhisattva Nityodyukta, the Bodhisattva Anik\u1e63iptadhura. He dwelt together with them and many other noble-minded Bodhisattvas, and with Sakra, the Indra or King of the Devas, and with Brahman Sahampati. With these and many other hundred thousands of Nayutas of sons of the gods, Bhagavat dwelt at Sr\u0101vasti.\n\nThen Bhagavat addressed the honoured S\u0101riputra and said: O S\u0101riputra, after you have passed from here over a hundred thousand Kotis of Buddha-countries there is in the Eastern part a Buddha-country, a world called Sukhavat\u012b (the happy country). And there a Tath\u0101gata, called Amit\u0101yus, an Arhat, fully enlightened, dwells now, and remains, and supports himself, and teaches the Law.\n\nNow what do you think, S\u0101riputra, for what reason is that world called Sukhavat\u012b (the happy)? In that world Sukhavat\u012b, O S\u0101riputra, there is neither bodily nor mental pain for living beings. The sources of happiness are in-\nnumerable there. For that reason is that world called Sukhavat\u012b (the happy).\n\nAnd again, O S\u0101riputra, that world Sukhavat\u012b is adorned with seven terraces, with seven rows of palm-trees, and with strings of bells.\\textsuperscript{10} It is inclosed on every side,\\textsuperscript{11} beautiful, brilliant with the four gems, viz. gold, silver, beryl, and crystal.\\textsuperscript{12} With such arrays of excellences peculiar to a Buddha-country is that Buddha-country adorned.\n\nAnd again, O S\u0101riputra, in that world Sukhavat\u012b there are lotus lakes, adorned with the seven gems, viz. gold, silver, beryl, crystal, red pearls, diamonds, and corals as the seventh. They are full of water, which possesses the eight good qualities,\\textsuperscript{13} they have smooth bathing places, they are free from crows,\\textsuperscript{14} (or so full that crows may drink there), covered with golden sand, and of vast extent. And in these lotus lakes there are all around on the four sides four stairs, beautiful and brilliant with the four gems, viz. gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. And on every side of these lotus lakes gem trees are growing, beautiful and brilliant with the seven gems, viz. gold, silver, beryl, crystal, red pearls, diamonds, and corals, as the seventh. And in those lotus lakes lotus flowers are growing, blue, blue-coloured, of blue splendour, blue to behold; yellow, yellow-coloured, of yellow splendour, yellow to behold; red, red-coloured, of red splendour, red to behold; white, white-coloured, of white splendour, white to behold; beautiful, beautifully-coloured, of beautiful splendour, beautiful to behold, and in circumference as large as the wheel of a chariot.\n\nAnd again, O S\u0101riputra, in that Buddha-country there are heavenly musical instruments always played on, and the earth is lovely and of golden colour. And in that Buddha-country a flower rain of heavenly M\u0101nd\u0101rava blossoms pours down three times every day, and three times every night. And the beings who are born there worship before their morning meal\\textsuperscript{15} a hundred thousand Kotis of Buddhas by going to other worlds; and having showered a hundred thousand of Kotis of flowers upon each Tath\u0101gata, they return to their own world in time for the afternoon rest.\\textsuperscript{16} With such\narrays of excellences peculiar to a Buddha-country is that Buddha-country adorned.\n\nAnd again, O S\u0101riputra, there are in that Buddha-country swans, curlews, and peacocks. Three times every night, and three times every day, they come together and perform a concert, each uttering his own note. And from them thus uttering proceeds a sound proclaiming the five virtues, the five powers, and the seven steps leading towards the highest knowledge. When the men there hear that sound, remembrance of Buddha, remembrance of the Law, remembrance of the Assembly, rises in their mind.\n\nNow, do you think, O S\u0101riputra, that these are beings who have entered into the nature of animals (birds, etc.)? This is not to be thought of. The very name of hells is unknown in that Buddha-country, and likewise that of (descent into) animal natures and of the realm of Yama (the four ap\u0101yas). No, these tribes of birds have been made on purpose by the Tath\u0101gata Amit\u0101yus, and they utter the sound of the Law. With such arrays of excellences, etc.\n\nAnd again, O S\u0101riputra, when those rows of palm-trees and strings of bells in that Buddha-country are moved by the wind, a sweet and enrapturing sound proceeds from them. Yes, O S\u0101riputra, as from a heavenly musical instrument consisting of a hundred thousand Kotis of sounds, when played by \u0100ryas, a sweet and enrapturing sound proceeds, a sweet and enrapturing sound proceeds from those rows of palm-trees and strings of bells moved by the wind. And when the men there hear that sound, reflection on Buddha arises in their body, reflection on the Law, reflection on the Assembly. With such arrays of excellences, etc.\n\nNow what do you think, O S\u0101riputra, for what reason is that Tath\u0101gata called Amit\u0101yus? The length of life (\u0101yus), O S\u0101riputra, of that Tath\u0101gata and of those men there is immeasurable (amita). Therefore is that Tath\u0101gata called Amit\u0101yus. And ten Kalpas have passed, O S\u0101riputra, since that Tath\u0101gata awoke to perfect knowledge.\n\nAnd what do you think, O S\u0101riputra, for what reason is that Tath\u0101gata called Amit\u0101bh\u0101s? The splendour (abh\u0101s),\nO S\u0101riputra, of that Tath\u0101gata is unimpeded over all Buddha-countries. Therefore is that Tath\u0101gata called Amit\u0101bh\u0101s.\n\nAnd there is, O S\u0101riputra, an innumerable assembly of disciples with that Tath\u0101gata, purified and venerable persons, whose number it is not easy to count. With such arrays of excellences, etc.\n\nAnd again, O S\u0101riputra, of those beings also who are born in the Buddha-country of the Tath\u0101gata Amit\u0101yus as purified Bodhisattvas, never to return again and bound by one birth only, of those Bodhisattvas also, O S\u0101riputra, the number is not easy to count, except they are reckoned as infinite in number.\n\nThen again all beings, O S\u0101riputra, ought to make fervent prayer for that Buddha-country. And why? Because they come together there with such excellent men. Beings are not born in that Buddha-country of the Tath\u0101gata Amit\u0101yus as a reward and result of good works performed in this present life. No, whatever son or daughter of a family shall hear the name of the blessed Amit\u0101yus, the Tath\u0101gata, and having heard it, shall keep it in mind, and with thoughts undisturbed shall keep it in mind for one, two, three, four, five, six or seven nights, that son or daughter of a family, when he or she comes to die, then that Amit\u0101yus, the Tath\u0101gata, surrounded by an assembly of disciples and followed by a host of Bodhisattvas, will stand before them at their hour of death, and they will depart this life with tranquil minds. After their death they will be born in the world Sukhavati, in the Buddha-country of the same Amit\u0101yus, the Tath\u0101gata. Therefore then, O S\u0101riputra, having perceived this cause and effect, I with reverence say thus, Every son and every daughter of a family ought to make with their whole mind fervent prayer for that Buddha-country.\n\nAnd now, O S\u0101riputra, as I here at present glorify that world, thus in the East, O S\u0101riputra, other blessed Buddhas, led by the Tath\u0101gata Akshobhya, the Tath\u0101gata Merudhvaga, the Tath\u0101gata Mah\u0101meru, the Tath\u0101gata Meruprabh\u0101sa, and the Tath\u0101gata Mangudhvaga, equal in number to the sand of\nthe river Gang\u00e2, comprehend their own Buddha-countries in their speech, and then reveal them. Accept this repetition of the Law, called the \"Favour of all Buddhas,\" which magnifies their inconceivable excellences.\n\nThus also in the South, do other blessed Buddhas, led by the Tath\u00e2gata Kandra\u015b\u00fbryapradipa, the Tath\u00e2gata Yasahprabha, the Tath\u00e2gata Mah\u00e2r\u00e2kiskandha, the Tath\u00e2gata Merupradipa, the Tath\u00e2gata Anantavirya, equal in number to the sand of the river Gang\u00e2, comprehend their own Buddha-countries in their speech, and then reveal them. Accept, etc.\n\nThus also in the West do other blessed Buddhas, led by the Tath\u00e2gata Amit\u00e2yus, the Tath\u00e2gata Amit\u00e2skandha, the Tath\u00e2gata Amitadhvaya, the Tath\u00e2gata Mah\u00e2prabha, the Tath\u00e2gata Mah\u00e2ratnaketu, the Tath\u00e2gata Suddharasamprabha, equal in number to the sand of the river Gang\u00e2, comprehend, etc.\n\nThus also in the North do other blessed Buddhas, led by the Tath\u00e2gata Mah\u00e2r\u00e2kiskandha, the Tath\u00e2gata Vaisv\u00e2nara-nirgho\u015ba, the Tath\u00e2gata Dundubhisvaranirgho\u015ba, the Tath\u00e2gata Dushpradharsha, the Tath\u00e2gata \u00c2dityasambhava, the Tath\u00e2gata Galeniprabha (Gvalanaprabha?), equal in number to the sand, etc.\n\nThus also in the Nadir do other blessed Buddhas, led by the Tath\u00e2gata Simha, the Tath\u00e2gata Yasas, the Tath\u00e2gata Yasahprabh\u00e2va, the Tath\u00e2gata Dharm\u00e2, the Tath\u00e2gata Dharmadhara, the Tath\u00e2gata Dharmadhvaya, equal in number to the sand, etc.\n\nThus also in the Zenith do other blessed Buddhas, led by the Tath\u00e2gata Brahmaghosha, the Tath\u00e2gata Nakshatr\u00e2r\u00e2ga, the Tath\u00e2gata Indraketudhvagar\u00e2ga, the Tath\u00e2gata Gandhottama, the Tath\u00e2gata Gandhaprabh\u00e2sa, the Tath\u00e2gata Mah\u00e2r\u00e2kiskandha, the Tath\u00e2gata Ratnakusumassampushpitag\u00e2tra, the Tath\u00e2gata S\u00e2lendrar\u00e2ga, the Tath\u00e2gata Ratnotpalari, the Tath\u00e2gata Sarv\u00e2darma, the Tath\u00e2gata Sumerukalpa, equal in number to the sand, etc.\n\nNow what do you think, O \u015a\u0101riputra, for what reason is that repetition of the Law called the Favour of all Buddhas? Every son or daughter of a family who shall hear the name\nof that repetition of the Law and retain in their memory the names of those blessed Buddhas, will all be favoured by the Buddhas, and will never return again, being once in possession of the transcendent true knowledge. Therefore, then, O S\u0101riputra, believe, accept, and long for me and those blessed Buddhas!\n\nWhatever sons or daughters of a family shall make mental prayer for the Buddha-country of that blessed Amit\u0101yus, the Tath\u0101gata, or is making it now or has made it formerly, all these will never return again, being once in possession of the transcendent true knowledge. They will be born in that Buddha-country, have been born, or are being born now. Therefore, then, O S\u0101riputra, mental prayer is to be made for that Buddha-country by faithful sons and daughters of a family.\n\nAnd as I at present magnify here the inconceivable excellences of those blessed Buddhas, thus, O S\u0101riputra, do those blessed Buddhas magnify my own inconceivable excellences.\n\nA very difficult work has been done by \u015a\u0101kyamuni, the sovereign of the \u015a\u0101kyas. Having obtained the transcendent true knowledge in this world S\u0101ha, he taught the Law which all the world is reluctant to accept, during this corruption of the present Kalpa, during this corruption of mankind, during this corruption of belief, during this corruption of life, during this corruption of passions.\n\nThis is even for me, O S\u0101riputra, an extremely difficult work that, having obtained the transcendent true knowledge in this world S\u0101ha, I taught the Law which all the world is reluctant to accept, during this corruption of mankind, of belief, of passion, of life, and of this present Kalpa.\n\nThus spoke Bhagavat joyful in his mind. And the honourable S\u0101riputra, and the Bhikshus and Bodhisattvas, and the whole world with the gods, men, evil spirits and genii, applauded the speech of Bhagavat.\n\nThis is the Mah\u0101y\u0101nas\u016btra called Sukhavativy\u016bha.\nThis S\u016btra sounds to us, no doubt, very different from the original teaching of Buddha. And so it is. Nevertheless it is the most popular and most widely read S\u016btra in Japan, and the whole religion of the great mass of the people may be said to be founded on it. \"Repeat the name of Amit\u0101bha as often as you can, repeat it particularly in the hour of death, and you will go straight to Sukhavati and be happy for ever;\" this is what Japanese Buddhists are asked to believe, this is what they are told was the teaching of Buddha. There is one passage in our S\u016btra which seems even to be pointedly directed against the original teaching of Buddha. Buddha taught that as a man soweth so shall he reap, and that by a stock of good works accumulated on earth, the way is opened to higher knowledge and higher bliss. Our S\u016btra says No; not by good works done on earth, but by a mere repetition of the name of Amit\u0101bha is an entrance gained into the land of bliss. This is no better than what later Brahmanism teaches, viz. \"Repeat the name of Hari or of Krishna, and you will be saved.\" It is no better than what even some Christian teachers are reported to teach. It may be that in a lower stage of civilization even such teaching has produced some kind of good. But Japan is surely ripe for better things. Is it not high time that the millions who live in Japan, and profess a faith in Buddha, should be told that this doctrine of Amit\u0101bha and all the Mah\u0101y\u0101na doctrine is a secondary form of Buddhism, a corruption of the pure doctrine of the Royal Prince, and that, if they really mean to be Buddhists, they should return to the words of Buddha, as they are preserved to us in the old S\u016btras? Instead of depending, as they now do, on Chinese translations, not always accurate, of degraded and degrading Mah\u0101y\u0101na tracts, why should they not have Japanese translations of the best portions of Buddha's real doctrine, which would elevate their character, and give them a religion of which they need not be ashamed? There are Chinese translations of some of the better portions of the Sacred Writings of\n\n1 See H. Yule, Marco Polo, 2nd ed. vol. i. pp. 441-443.\nBuddhism. They exist in Japan too, as may be seen in that magnificent collection of the Buddhist Tripitaka which was sent from Japan as a present to the English Government, and of which Mr. Beal has given us a very useful Catalogue. But they are evidently far less considered in Japan than the silly and mischievous stories of Amit\u0101bha and his Paradise.\n\nI hope that Mr. Bunyio Nanjio and Mr. Kasawara, if they diligently continue their study of Sanskrit and P\u0101li, will be able to do a really great and good work, after their return to Japan. And if more young Buddhist priests are coming over, I shall always, so far as my other occupations allow it, be glad to teach them, and to help them in their unselfish work. There is a great future in store, I believe, for those Eastern Islands, which have been called prophetically \"the England of the East,\" and to purify and reform their religion, that is, to bring it back to its original form, is a work that must be done before anything else can be attempted.\n\nIn return, I hope that they and their friends in Japan, and in Corea and China too, will do all they can to discover, if possible, some more ancient Sanskrit texts, and send them over to us. A beginning, at all events, has been made, and if the members of this Society, who have friends in China or in Japan, will help, if H. E. the Japanese Minister, Mori Arinori, who has honoured us by his presence to-day, will lend us his powerful assistance, I have little doubt that the dream which passed before the mind of your late President may still become a reality, and that some of the MSS. which, beginning with the beginning of our era, were carried from India to China, Corea, and Japan, may return to us, whether in the original or in copies, like the one sent to me by Mr. Shuntai Ishikawa.\n\nWith the help of such MSS. we shall be able all the better to show to those devoted students who from the extreme East have come to the extreme West in order to learn to read their sacred writings in the original Sanskrit or P\u0101li, what difference there is between the simple teaching of\nBuddha and the later developments and corruptions of Buddhism. Buddha himself, I feel convinced, never knew the names of Amit\u0101bha, Avalokitesvara, or Sukhavati. Then how can a nation call itself Buddhist whose religion consists chiefly in a belief in a divine Amit\u0101bha and his son Avalokitesvara, and in a hope of eternal life in the paradise of Sukhavati?\n\nNotes.\n\n1 Sr\u0101vasti, capital of the Northern Kosalas, residence of King Prasenajit. It was in ruins when visited by Fa-Hian (init. V. Sase.); not far from the modern Fizabad. Cf. Burnouf, Introduction, p. 22.\n\n2 S\u0101rda, with, the Pali saddhim. Did not the frequent mention of 1,200 and a half, i.e., 1,250, 1,300 and a half, i.e., 1,350, persons accompanying Buddha arise from a misunderstanding of s\u0101rda, meaning originally 'with a half'?\n\n3 Abhi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101n\u0101bhij\u00f1\u0101t\u0101i. The Japanese text reads abhi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101bhij\u00f1\u0101t\u0101i, i.e., abhi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101n\u0101bhij\u00f1\u0101t\u0101i. If it be known to be the correct reading, we should translate it by 'known by knowledge,' not a vir\u016bpa, i.e., a form, famous. Abhi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101 in the sense of known, famous, occurs in Lalita-Vistara, p. 25, and the Chinese translators adopted that meaning here. Again, if we preferred the reading abhi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101n\u0101bhij\u00f1\u0101t\u0101i, this too would admit of an intelligible rendering, viz., known or distinguished by the marks or characteristics, the good qualities, that ought to belong to a Bhikshu. But the technical meaning is 'possessed of a knowledge of the five abhi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101s.' It would be better in that case to write abhi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101n\u0101bhij\u00f1\u0101nai, but no MSS. seem to support that reading. The five abhi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101s are: the knowledge of Arhat, which are six divisions, the divine hearing, the knowledge of the thoughts of others, the remembrance of former existences, and magic power. See Burnouf, Lotus, Appendix, No. xiv. The larger text of the Sukhavat\u012bvy\u016bha has abhi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101n\u0101bhij\u00f1\u0101nai, and afterwards abhi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101n\u0101bhij\u00f1\u0101nai. The position of the participle as the uttara-pada in such compounds as abhi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101n\u0101bhij\u00f1\u0101nai is common in Buddhistic Sanskrit.\n\n4 Mah\u0101r\u0101vaka, the great disciples, properly the eighty principal disciples.\n\n5 Arhadbh\u012ba. I have left the correct Sanskrit form, because the Japanese text clearly gives the termination adhi\u0101. H\u014dgo's text has the more usual form arhantai\u0101. The change of the old classical arhat into the Pali arahan, and then back into Sanskrit arhanta, arahanta, and at last arahanta, with the meaning of 'destroyer of the enemies,' i.e., the passions, shows very clearly the different stages through which Sanskrit words pass in the different shades of Buddhist Literature. In Tibet, in Mongolia, and in China, Arhat is translated by 'destroyer of the enemy.' See Burnouf, Lotus, p. 287, Introduction, p. 295. Arhat is the title of the Bhikshu on reaching the fourth degree of perfection. Cf. Sutra of the 42 Sections, cap. 2. Clemens of Alexandria (d. 220) speaks of the Zephyr who worshipped a pyramid erected over the relics of a god. Is this a translation of Arhat, as Lassen (De nom. Ind. philosoph. in Rhein Museum, vol. i. p. 187)\nON SANSKRIT TEXTS DISCOVERED IN JAPAN.\n\nand Burnouf (Introdt., p. 295) supposed, or a transliteration of Samana?

Ayuta, i.e. a hundred Ko\u1e6dis; Niyuta, i.e. a hundred Ayutas; and Nayuta, i.e. 1 with 22 zeros, are often confounded, nor does it matter much so far as any definite idea is concerned which such numerals convey to our mind.\n\nTish\u1e6dh\u0101ti dh\u012bryate y\u0101payati dharma\u1e41 ka desayati. This is evidently an idiomatic phrase, for it occurs again and again in the Nepalese text of the Sukhavativyuha (MS. 268, l. 1. 2; 55a, l. 2, etc.). If it is right, it seems to mean, he stands there, holds his breath, supports himself, and teaches the law. Burnouf translates the same phrase by \"il est trecent, vivent, existent\" (Lotus, p. 354). On y\u0101peti in Pali, see Fausb\u00f6ll, Dasarathi-j\u0101taka, pp. 26, 28; and y\u0101pasa in Sanskrit.\n\nKinkil\u0101la. The texts read kankanagalais ka and kaikanagalais ka, and again later kankanagalun\u0101m (also l\u0101) and kankanagal\u0101nam. Mr. Beal translates from Chinese, \"seven rows of exquisite curtaining,\" and again, \"gemuous curtains.\" First of all it seems clear that we must read g\u0101la, net, web, instead of gala. Secondly, kaikana, bracelet, gives no sense, for what could be the meaning of nets or strings of bracelets? I prefer to read kinkil\u0101la, nets or strings or wires, i.e. beads. Such rows of bells serve for ornamenting the garuda, and it may be said of them that, if removed by the wind, they give forth certain sounds. In the commentary on Dhammapada 30, p. 191, we meet with kinkik\u0101s\u0101la, from which likewise the music proceeds; see Childers, s.v. g\u0101la. In the MS. of the Nepalese Sukhavativyuha (R.A.S.), p. 39a, l. 4, I likewise find svaramaratana-kinkil\u0101l\u0101ni, which settles the matter, and shows how little confidence we can place in the Japanese texts.\nON SANSKRIT TEXTS DISCOVERED IN JAPAN.\n\n11 Anuparikshipta, inclosed; see parikkhepo in Childers' Dict.\n\n12 The four and seven precious things in P\u0101li are (according to Childers):\n\n1. suva\u1e47\u1e47a\u1e41, gold.\n2. ragat\u0101na\u1e41, silver.\n3. mut\u1e6d\u0101, pearls.\n4. masi, gems (as sapphire, ruby).\n5. veluriyam, cat's eye.\n6. vajir\u0101ma\u1e41, diamond.\n7. pav\u0101lam, coral.\n\nHere Childers translates cat's eye; but s.v. veluriyam, he says, a precious stone, perhaps lapis lazuli.\n\nIn Sanskrit (Burnouf, Lotus, p. 320):\n\n1. suva\u1e47\u1e47a\u1e41, gold.\n2. ragat\u0101na\u1e41, silver.\n3. va\u1e0d\u1e0dhurya, lapis lazuli.\n4. spharika, crystal.\n5. lohitamukti, red pearls.\n6. asmagarbha, diamond.\n7. mus\u0101ragalva, coral.\n\nJulien (P\u00e8lerins Bouddhistes, vol. ii. p. 482) gives the following list:\n\n1. sphazika, rock crystal.\n2. va\u1e0d\u1e0dhurya, lapis lazuli.\n3. asmagarbha, cornaline.\n4. mus\u0101ragalva, amber.\n5. pr\u0101r\u0101ga, ruby.\n\nVa\u1e0d\u1e0dhurya (or Va\u1e0d\u1e0dhura) is mentioned in the Tath\u0101gatagu\u1e47a\u015b\u0101nakintyayavishay\u0101vat\u0101ranid\u0101s (Wassilief, p. 161) as a precious stone which, if placed on green cloth, looks green, if placed on red cloth, red. The fact that va\u1e0d\u1e0dhurya is often compared with the colour of the eyes of a cat, would seem to point to the cat's eye (see Borooah's Engl. Sanskrit Dictionary, vol. ii. preface, p. ix), certainly not to lapis lazuli. Cat's eye is a kind of chalcedony. I see, however, that va\u1e0d\u1e0dhurya has been recognized as the original of the Greek \u0392\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b1\u03c2, a very ingenious conjecture, either of Weber's or of Potz's, considering that lingual d has a sound akin to r, and ry may be changed to ly and ll (Weber, Omina, p. 326). The Persian billaur or beldur, which Skeat gives as the etymon of \u0392\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b1\u03c2, is of Arabic origin, means crystal, and could hardly have found its way into Greek at so early a time.\n\n13 Purobhaktena. The text is difficult to read, but it can hardly be doubtful that purobhaktena corresponds to Pali purebbhattam, i.e. before the morning meal, opposed to pa\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101bhattam, after the noonday meal, i.e. in the afternoon. See Childers, s.v. P\u016bravabhaktik\u0101 is the first repast, as Prof. Cowell informs me.\n\n14 K\u0101k\u0101peya. One text reads K\u0101kapeya, the other K\u0101k\u0101peya. It is difficult to choose. The more usual word is k\u0101kapeya, which is explained by P\u0101nini ii. 1, 33. It is uncertain, however, whether k\u0101kapeya is meant as a laudatory or as a deprecatory term. Boehtlingk takes it in the latter sense, and translates nadi k\u0101kapeya, \"a shallow river that could be drunk up by a crow.\" T\u0101th\u0101gatha takes it in the former sense, and translates nadi k\u0101k\u0101peya, \"a river so full of water that a crow can drink it without bending its neck (k\u0101k\u0101ir anatakandhasari piyate; p\u016br\u1e47odakatvena pra\u1e63aye k\u0101k\u0101ir peye nady\u0101dau). In our passage k\u0101k\u0101peya must be a term of praise, and we therefore could only render it by \"ponds so full of water that crows could drink from them.\" But why should so well known a word as k\u0101kapeya have been spelt k\u0101k\u0101peya, unless it was done intentionally? And if intentionally, what was it intended for? We must remember that P\u0101nini ii. 1, 42 schol. teaches us how to form the novel t\u012brth\u0101k\u0101ra, a crow at a t\u012brtha, which was considered ill omen, and worse, because it was thought therefore that crows were considered out of place at a t\u012brtha or bathing place, either because they were birds of ill omen, or because they defiled the water. From that point of view, k\u0101k\u0101peya would mean a pond not visited by crows, free from crows.\nThe eight good qualities of water are limpidity, purity, refreshing coolness, sweetness, softness, fertilizing qualities, calmness, power of preventing famine, productivity. See Beal, Catena, p. 379.\n\nDivya vih\u0101r\u0101ya, for the moonday rest, the siesta. See Childers, s.v. vih\u0101ra.\n\nKran\u1e47\u0101k\u0101la. Snipe, curlew. Is it meant for Karavika, or Karavika, a fine-voiced bird? or for Kalavinka, P\u0101li Kalavika? See Burnouf, Lotus, p. 666. I see, however, the same birds mentioned together elsewhere, as hamsakran\u1e47\u0101kama-v\u012braukas\u0101likakokila, etc. On may\u016bra see Mah\u0101v. Intr. p. xxxix; Rig V. I. 191, 14.\n\nIndriyabhalabodhyangasabda. These are technical terms, but their meaning is not quite clear. Spence Hardy, in his Manual, p. 498, enumerates the five indriyas, viz. 1) sa\u00f1c\u0101ra, purity (probably aradh\u0101, faith), 2) wiraya, persevering exertion (v\u012brya), 3) sati or sm\u1e5bti, the ascertainment of truth (sm\u1e5bti), 4) sam\u0101dhi, tranquillity, 5) praj\u00f1\u0101-bala, power of knowledge.\n\nThe seven balya\u1e45ga (bodhy\u0101\u1e45ga) are according to him: 1) s\u012bhi or sm\u1e5bti, the ascertainment of the truth by mental application, 2) dharma\u015b\u0101l\u0101, the investigation of causes, 3) wiraya, persevering exertion, 4) priti, joy, 5) passadhi, or prasrabdhi, tranquillity, 6) sam\u0101dhi, tranquillity in a higher degree, including freedom from all that disturbs either body or mind, 7) upek\u1e63\u0101, equanimity.\n\nIt will be seen from this that some of these qualities or excellences occur both as indriyas and bodhy\u0101\u1e45ga, while bala are throughout identical with indriyas. Burnouf, however, in his Lotus, gives a list of five bala (from the Vocabulary Pentaglotte) which correspond with the five indriyas of Spence Hardy, viz. sa\u00f1c\u0101ra-bala, power of faith, v\u012brya-bala, power of vigour, sm\u1e5bti-bala, power of memory, sam\u0101dhi-bala, power of meditation, praj\u00f1\u0101-bala, power of knowledge. They precede the seven bodhy\u0101\u1e45ga both in the Lotus, the Vocabulary Pentaglotte, and the Lalita-Vistara.\n\nTo these seven bodhy\u0101\u1e45ga Burnouf has assigned a special treatise, Appendix xii. p. 796. They occur both in Sanskrit and P\u0101li.\n\nNiraya, the hells, also called Naraka. Yamaloka, the realm of Yama, the judge of the dead, is included in the four Ap\u0101ya, i.e. Naraka, hell, Tiriyagot, bir\u0101la, Peta, Pretaloka, realm of the dead, Asuraloka, realm of evil spirits. The three terms which are here used together, occur likewise in a passage translated by Burnouf, Introduction, p. 544.\n\nIti sankhy\u0101m gakkhanti, they are called, cf. Childers, s.v. sankhy\u0101. Asa\u1e45khya, even more than aprameya, is the recognized term for infinity. Burnouf, p. 852.\n\nAvaram\u0101traka. This is the P\u0101li oramattako, 'belonging merely to the present life,' and the intention of the writer seems to be to inculcate the doctrine of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na, that salvation can be obtained by mere repetitions of the name of Amit\u0101bha, in direct opposition to the original doctrine of Buddha, that as a man soweth, so he reapeth. Buddha would have taught that the kualaml\u0101, the root or the stock of good works performed in the world (avaram\u0101traka), will soon fail in the next, while the 'rain repetitions' sooner fill than is enjoined. The Chinese translators take a different view of this passage, and I am not myself quite certain that I have understood it rightly. But from the end of this section, where we read kulaputre\u1e47a v\u0101 kuladhi\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101 v\u0101 tatra buddha-k\u1e63etre \u0101ttapra\u015biddh\u0101n\u0101\u1e43 kartavyam, it seems clear that the locative (buddha-k\u1e63etre) forms the object of the pra\u015biddh\u0101na, the fervent prayer or longing. The Satpurusha already in the Buddhak\u1e63etra would be the innumerable men (manushy\u0101s) and Bodhisattvas mentioned before.\n\narthavasa, lit. the power of the thing; cf. Dhammapada, p. 388, v. 289.\n\nI am not quite certain as to the meaning of this passage, but if we enter into the bold metaphor of the text, viz. that the Buddhas cover the Buddhacountries with the organ of their tongue and then unroll it, what is intended can hardly be anything but that they first try to find words for the excellences of\nON SANSKRIT TEXTS DISCOVERED IN JAPAN.\n\nthose countries, and then reveal or proclaim them. Burnouf, however (Lotus, p. 417), takes the expression in a literal sense, though he is shocked by its grotesqueness. On these Buddhas and their countries, see Burnouf, Lotus, p. 113.\n\n24 Pratityatha. The texts give again and again patitiyatha, evidently the Pali form, instead of pratityatha. I have left tha, the Pali termination of the 2 p. pl. in the imperative, instead of ta, because that form was clearly intended, while pa for pra may be an accident. Yet I have little doubt that pratityatha was in the original text. That it is meant for the imperative, we see from siddhadh\u0101tum, etc., further on. Other traces of the influence of Pali or Prakrit on the Sanskrit of our text appear in mah\u0101bh\u016bta, the Sanskrit reading for mah\u0101bh\u016bta, which I preferred; samah\u016bla for bahula; dh\u1e5byate instead of purobhaktan; anyatra; sa\u1e45kh\u0101ya g\u0101k\u1e63anti; avaram\u0101traka; veda\u1e47a instead of vedanta, in nirvedana; dharmaparyaya (Corp. Inscript. plate xv.), etc.\n\n25 The Sukhavat\u012bvy\u016bha, even in its shortest text, is called a Mah\u0101y\u0101na-s\u016btra, nor is there any reason why a Mah\u0101y\u0101na-s\u016btra should not be short. The meaning of Mah\u0101y\u0101na-s\u016btra is simply a S\u016btra belonging to the Mah\u0101y\u0101na-school, the school of the Great Vehicle. It was Burnouf who, in his \"Introduction to the History of Buddhism,\" tried very hard to establish a distinction between the Vaipulya or developed S\u016btras, and what he calls the simple S\u016btras. Now the Vaipulya S\u016btras may well belong to the Mah\u0101y\u0101na-school, but that does not prove that all the S\u016btras of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na-school, i.e., Vaipulya or developed S\u016btras. The name of Simple S\u016btra, in opposition to the Vaipulya or developed S\u016btras, is not recognized by the Buddhists themselves; it is really an invention of Burnouf's. No doubt there is a great difference between a Vaipulya S\u016btra, such as the Lotus of the Good Law, translated by Burnouf, and the S\u016btras which Burnouf translated from the Divy\u0101vad\u0101na. But what Burnouf considers as the distinguishing mark of a Vaipulya S\u016btra, viz., the occurrence of Bodhisattvas, as followers of the Buddha Mah\u0101y\u0101na, would no longer seem to be tenable, unless we abandon the short Sukhavat\u012bvy\u016bha, and take the Vaipulya or developed S\u016btras. For this there is no authority. Our S\u016btra is called a Mah\u0101y\u0101na S\u016btra, never a Vaipulya S\u016btra, and yet among the followers of Buddha, the Bodhisattvas constitute a very considerable portion. But more than that, Amit\u0101bha, the Buddha of Sukhavati, another personage whom Burnouf looks upon as peculiar to the Vaipulya-S\u016btras, who is in fact one of the Dhy\u0101ni-buddhas, though not called by that name in our S\u016btra, forms the chief object of our S\u016btra, and is represented as contemporary with Buddha \u015a\u0101kyamuni.\u2020 The larger text of the Sukhavat\u012bvy\u016bha would certainly, according to Burnouf's doctrine, belong to the category of the Vaipulya S\u016btras. But it is not so called in the MSS. which I have seen, and Burnouf himself gives an analysis of that S\u016btra (Introduction, p. 99), as a specimen of a Mah\u0101y\u0101na, but not of a Vaipulya S\u016btra.\n\n* La pr\u00e9sence des Bodhisattvas ou leur absence int\u00e9resse donc le fond m\u00eame des livres o\u00f9 on la remarque, et il est bien \u00e9vident que ce seul point trace une

expressed in my paper on \"Sanskrit Texts discovered in Japan,\" viz. that other Sanskrit texts might still come to light in Japan or China, has been fulfilled sooner than I expected. Mr. A. Wylie wrote to me on the 3rd of March that he had brought a number of Sanskrit-Chinese books from Japan, and he afterwards kindly sent them to me to examine. They were of the same appearance and character as the Dictionary which Dr. Edkins had lent me and the Sukhavati-vyuha which I had received from Japan. But with the exception of a collection of invocations, called the Vagga-sutra, and the short Prag\u00f1\u0101-hridaya-sutra, they contained no continuous texts. The books were intended to teach the Sanskrit alphabet, and every possible and impossible combination of the Devan\u0101gar\u012b letters, and that was all. Still, so large a number of books written to teach the Sanskrit alphabet augurs well for the existence of Sanskrit texts. There was among Mr. Wylie's books a second Chinese-Sanskrit-Japanese vocabulary, of which Mr. Kasawara has given me the following account: \"This vocabulary is called 'A thousand Sanskrit and Chinese words,' and it is said to have been arranged by I-sing, who left China for India in 671, about 27 years after Hiouen-thsang's return to China, and who is best known as the author of a book called Nan-hae-ki-kwei-chou'en, on the manners and customs of the Indian Buddhists at that time.\n\n\"This vocabulary was brought from China to Japan by Zikaku, a Japanest priest, who went to China in 838 and returned in 847. It is stated at the end of the book, that in the year 884 a Japanese priest of the name of Riroyu copied that vocabulary from a text belonging to another priest, Y\u016bkai. The edition brought from Japan by Mr. Wylie was published there in the year 1727 by a priest called Jiakumyo.\"\n\nThe following curious passage occurs in the preface of Jiakumyo's edition: \"This vocabulary is generally called 'one thousand Sanskrit and Chinese words.' It is stated in Annen's work, that this was first brought (from China) by\nZikaku. I have corrected several mistakes in this vocabulary, comparing many copies; yet the present edition is not free from blunders; I hope the readers will correct them, if they have better copies.\n\n\"In the temple Horiuji, in Yamato, there are treasured Pragn\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101hridayas\u016btram, and 'Sonsho'-dh\u0101ra\u1e47i, written on two palm leaves, handed down from Central India; and, at the end of these, fourteen letters of the 'siddha' are written. In the present edition of the vocabulary the alphabet is in imitation of that of the palm leaves, except such forms of letters as cannot be distinguished from those prevalent among the scriveners at the present day.\n\n\"Horiuji is one of eleven temples founded by the prince Umayado (who died A.D. 621). This temple is at a town named Tatsuta, in the province Yamato, near Kyoto, the western capital.\"\n\nHere, then, we have clear evidence that in the year 1727 palm-leaves containing the text of Sanskrit S\u016btras were still preserved in the temple of H\u014driuji. If that temple is still in existence, might not some Buddhist priest of Kyoto, the western capital of Japan, be induced to go there to see whether the palm leaves are still there, and, if they are, to make a copy and send it to Oxford?\n\nF. M. M.\nART. VII.\u2014Extracts from Report on the Islands and Antiquities of Bahrein. By Captain Durand. With Notes by Major-General Sir H. C. Rawlinson, K.C.B., F.R.S.\n\nThese Islands, from which the Portuguese were expelled by a British fleet aiding Shah Abbas in 1622 A.D., and of which the advantages were tersely put to me by a native the other day in the words, \"The land is silver and the sea is pearl,\" are situated generally in lat. 26\u00b0 and long. 50\u00b0, the exact position of the Portuguese fort on the larger island being given as lat. 26\u00b0 13' 53\" N., long. 50\u00b0 31' 45\" E. They are surrounded by shoal water on every side, which greatly adds to the beauty of the place. Thus, on looking out to sea on the morning of a clear sky and a fresh nor'-wester, it would seem as if Nature, at all times lavish of effect, had here, however, exhausted every tint of living green in her paint box; and then, wearying of the effort, had splashed an angry streak of purple into the foreground. The water itself is so clear that you can see far down into the coral depths, while springs of fresh water bubble up through the brine, both near the entrance of the harbour and at several other places along the coast.\n\nLocal stories relate that, a long time ago, a chief called Ibn Hakim came from Katif, wishing to marry a lovely daughter of the Bahrein Chief. But titles or money must have been wanting, as his proposals were treated with contempt. On this, he began warlike operations by depriving the thirsty Bahreinees of the water from three wells\u2014one at Ali, one in the Bil\u00e1d-i-Kad\u00edm, and one\n\n1 Enclosure to letter addressed by Lieut.-Col.

The invader, however, was, it is said, eventually defeated, and compelled to retire to the mainland. Though these shallow seas are undeniably a beautiful feature in the landscape, they are also very dangerous; for they have never been thoroughly surveyed; in fact, except to the north and north-east of the islands, the soundings are practically unknown. Bahrein being surrounded on three sides by the mainland lying roughly at a distance of 30 to 40 miles off, the intermediate ocean, which is the unsurveyed part, is the very one from which an attack may be apprehended, and against which it might, therefore, be difficult to guard. From the top of the Jebel Dukhan, or hill of smoke, in the very centre of the larger island, a perfect view of this sea and the encircling mainland is obtainable; and this, if necessary, could be very easily made use of as a signalling station, as the hill-top is distinctly visible both from Muharrak and Manameh.\n\nThe interior of the islands of Bahrein (and of the large one in particular) presents some very marked features. Thus, beginning at the centre and looking outwards, taking one's stand on the Jebel Dukhan, the whole lies below in full view. Firstly, the hill itself, which rises about 400 feet above the sea-level, looks like the old crater of a volcano with an encircling ring of cliffs facing inwards some three or four miles off; yet these really present no appearance of volcanic action. From the outer crest of this ring of cliffs the land slopes more or less gradually down to the sea on all sides.\n\nThe original chart of Bahrein harbour, though scarcely intended to be an accurate land survey, shows fairly the lie of the ground. To the south and east, all the island is very bare; but, almost due west of the Jebel, groups of palm-trees begin to line the coast and stretch thence all round.\n\n---\n\n1 I have marked the lowest line of survey, east and west of north in my trading from the chart supplied to Her Majesty's Navy vessels.\n2 By Commander Constable and Lieut. Wiah, resurveyed in 1872-74 by Messrs. S. Thompson and Cuthbert, of Her Majesty's schooner Constance.\nthe northern shore to the north-east, being abundantly supplied with water, for which, indeed, Bahrain is famous. The Arabs imagine these and other springs on the mainland to be an underground stream from the Euphrates, the \"Euphraten flumen per quoddam Arabiae emergere putant\" of Pliny, vi. 159. The principal springs are the Gassari on the road from Manameh to the Bil\u00e1d-i-Kad\u00edm; the Umm-i-Shaoom, a mile to the eastward of Manameh; the Abu Geidan, in the Bil\u00e1d-i-Kad\u00edm; and the Adari, which last supplies many miles of date-groves through a canal of ancient workmanship, the stone of which in some places is falling in, but which still forms a perfect river of fast-running water, about 10 feet broad by two in depth. The spring itself is from 30 to 35 feet deep, and rises so strongly that a diver is forced upwards on nearing the bottom.\u00b9\n\nThe water, where it rises from this deep spring, whose basin artificially banked is about 22 yards broad by 40 long, is as clear as crystal, with a slightly green tint. It holds a shoal or two of large fish and many water tortoises. It is not perfectly sweet, and this applies to nearly all the wells, the best drinking water being brought on camels from the wells of the Umm Koefih and Hanaini,\u00b2 said to be 20 fathoms deep, in the hills of Rifaa. The water is conducted from these various wells by ordinary unbanked channels, the larger of which have now come to look like natural streams.\n\nOn nearing the coast, white dusty ground\u2014the relic, probably, of former habitations\u2014intrudes everywhere; and mighty mounds bare of vegetation tower above the palm groves. Mass upon mass, mound upon mound, they stretch on in endless chains all round the slope that falls from the cliffs to the sea, clinging more particularly, perhaps, to the higher ground, but being found in separate clusters near the coast itself. The parent group seems to be that at Ali, a modern village, but other large ones are\n\n\u00b9 I had some pearl divers with me who went down and walked about on the bottom; they then looked like pigmies about a foot high.\n\u00b2 Names of two villages a mile or so apart on the top of the circle of cliffs.\nto be found at many places, noticeably in the Bil\u00e1d-i-Kad\u00edm. The red ones on the left of the high road to Rifaa, and the chain of five or six large ones facing the northern sea near the village of Sirabe, which are only some out of very many groups, are all more or less worthy of notice. I shall have to recur again to these monuments.\n\nI have already given a slight sketch of the individuality of these islands, if I may use the term, in connexion with the lie of the ground, and the certainty forced upon even the most superficial observer that he is standing upon no common soil, but on that of a land which, although now desolate enough, has probably teemed with life, and under whose dust may, possibly, lie the history of countless generations. I have also mentioned the tumuli, which cover the island on all sides, from the coast to the centre or the cliffs of the central basin. I will now take one glance at what is known of the earliest historic days of the race that peopled these islands, and then give a brief account of what three weeks of constant research have disclosed, leaving it for others, who know more about these matters than I do, to judge whether my conclusions are right or wrong.\n\nWe know that these islands have been ruled by Phoenicians, Babylonians (?), Persians, Arabs, and Portuguese. With regard to the first-named Herodotus says that \"the Phoenicians first dwelt upon the Erythrean Sea, having migrated thence to the Mediterranean, when, etc.,\" and again, later on, in his account of the forces that Xerxes paraded for the conquest of Greece, after having mentioned that the Phoenicians of Sidon had won the regatta held at the foot of that monarch's marble throne on Abydos, he adds that \"according to their own account this nation dwelt anciently upon the Erythrean Sea, but, crossing thence, fixed themselves upon the Coast of Syria, where they still inhabit.\"\n\nMy first visit to the Sheikh resulted in an immediate call for horses and a ride out from Muharrak to the date-groves of Simabi, where the Chief said they had lately come upon an old well. The sand-hills on this side of the island evidently\n1. Sketch of stone discovered by Capt Durand.\n   (2 ft. 2 in. long).\n\n2. Palm branch over inscription.\n\n3. Facsimile of inscription on stone.\n\n4. The same in Assyrian.\ncover old buildings,\u00b9 and the \"well\" that had been found was either a stone conduit with cross branches or the foundations of an old stone building, some six or seven feet below the surface, now holding water. The ground had been struck with a scraper to make room for a young date plant, and had fallen in, thus disclosing the stone work below. I could not ask to search there, as it would have damaged the garden, but I asked the gardener, though in vain, to go down, and find out what it was.\n\nAfter this I rode round to every mosque on this side of the island, thinking it most likely to find intelligent inhabitants there. I was taken to many, into the walls of which old Arabic inscriptions had been let, and to the ruined mosque of the Meshed-i-Ab\u00fa-Zeid\u00e1n,\u00b2 near the Bil\u00e1d-i-Kad\u00edm, said to have been built with the material of a still older structure, and likely, therefore, to yield specimens of old writing. It contains one old tablet, and a ring of stones round one, if not two, of its room walls are scored with large Kufic letters, perhaps from some earlier building. These I did not copy.\n\nAt last, after having visited twenty mosques at least, which produced nothing but a cup of coffee, a kallian, and innumerable complaints of the tyranny of the Sheikhs and their tribe, I was told of a stone that nobody could read. This, therefore, I went to see, and found it imbedded in the \"holy of holies\" in the Madrasseh-i-Daood, in the Bil\u00e1d-i-Kadim. The stone is of black basalt shaped like the prow of a boat, or an animal's tongue, and is two feet two inches long. I had no difficulty in getting it, in spite of its holy\n\n\u00b9 I have since heard from Abdullah bin Rijjah, one of a rich firm of brothers, engaged in the pearl trade, that when he was a boy he remembers seeing the officers of a French and an English frigate accompanied by a Persian (Ailehi) Ambassador digging and turning over stones in this very place. He did not know with what results.\n\n\u00b2 The well of the Ab\u00fa-Zeid\u00e1n is worth mentioning. It springs under an arch of stone, which serves as the foundation of part of the walls of a small mosque. The water is beautiful and warm in the cool weather, being said to become cold in the hot. I suppose the change is merely in the temperature of the air. A stone pillar with two circular stones as a basement rising from the water supports part of the superstructure. The pattern on the outer arch is peculiar.\nTHE ISLAND OF RAHREIN.\n\nI visited the Mollahs that it was a fire-temple, worshiping an idol, and had no business to meddle in my argument, I gave a few rupees and said that the loss was made up to them. A slave who dug it put and carried it away.\n\nThe characters are evidently Babylonian or Assyrian, but some of the characters look like Phoenician.\n\nIn the tumuli, it is possible that some of the remains of the Phoenician temples noticed by Mr. Layard. Those nearest to the village of Ali have been destroyed; the top of them formed of shaped blocks of stone. I cannot mention all the places on these hills which probably contain buried buildings, but content myself with drawing attention to one or two of the most interesting.\n\nPassing the town of Manameh, the western road, passing through the date gardens, lands one in the Wil\u00e2yat-i-Kadim, 'the ancient city,' where, probably in the same memorial, building has been piled upon building. There several mounds, rising white and shrubless, attract attention, but leaving these again, and inclining to the south-west, passing the Portuguese fort on the sea-shore, vast massive and imposing in its decay, we come upon two high sand-hills, chained together, facing the northern sea at the distance of a mile or so from the beach, near the villages of Harboora and Shirebi. These I walked over, but found only one outlying stone, a large mass that bore signs of shaping. One square-cut hole, as if for the jamb of a huge door, was obvious, as also two channels square-cut in the same face. I regret that I took at the time but little notice of these. It is only deductively, after seeing other mounds and going over half the island, that I have been led to attach importance to these particular mounds, from the fact, firstly, of their size, secondly, of their position in a land facing the sea, and, thirdly, because there are no mounds of lesser proportions near them.\n\nLeaving these, however, I retraced my steps to the Bil\u00e2d-i-Kadim.\ni-Kadim, and on starting, again, I passed through date groves, and found myself almost immediately on a broad road entirely devoid of a single blade of grass, and appearing to be raised an inch or two above the surrounding soil, which bears a few scattered shrubs. This, I think, for part of its length at least, was at one time a made road: there is not, however, enough traffic at the present day between \"Ali\" and Manameh to beat out a sheep track.\n\nThis village of \"Ali,\" where the road lands us in a small tumbled-down village, inhabited by Shias, is built of and over old habitations, and immediately outside of it there is a most singular group of mounds, to which I will now draw attention. They number about 25 or 30, some larger, some smaller, the largest being from forty to fifty feet high, and from forty to fifty yards through their broadest base; they are somewhat furrowed by the weather, but retain a strong family likeness, particularly in the squareness of their tops, which are often indented; they are bare and close together, which facts (in spite of the enormous block of shaped sandstone cropping out near and on the top of some, and the gallery in one of them, also near the summit) made me doubt the correctness of my first conjecture that they must be temples. Still, as they were the only distinctly shaped mounds of their size that I was able to examine closely, while immediately behind them stretched chain upon chain, and group upon group of lesser tumuli, unquestionably graves, I clung to the hope that this large group might be something more. But if these miles upon miles of crowded heaps are tombs, where did the inhabitants live? Probably they lived along the coast as at present, building their houses of the branches of the palm-tree, as do still the poorer classes.\n\nOr, possibly, these islands may have been the cemetery of Gerrha, which was the great Phoenician mart in these parts, and which is believed to have been at the bottom of the long bay behind Bahrein; while other causes, such as their fertility, and their abundance in beautiful water, may have caused them to have been regarded as holy ground. The correct site of Gerrha has been somewhat disputed. D'Anville places it\nat Katif; Niebuhr, at Koweit or Grain; and Forster, I think, probably correctly, at the bottom of the bay behind Bahrein.\n\nI have been told by Arabs that there are many large ruins on the mainland, and one man in particular told me that they had found traces of building stones and pillars at a place where salt is quarried. The bottom of the Gulf behind Bahrein has, I believe, never been carefully explored.\n\nTo return, however, to the mounds at Ali. On my first arrival, I went over and round many of the larger ones, and at last my perseverance was rewarded by finding an entrance into one of these (under a flat stone near the summit), through which, lying down, we were just able to creep, and on getting beyond the opening we found ourselves in a long passage or gallery, which was, however, blocked with fallen masonry a few yards in front of us. The roof of this passage is formed by transverse blocks of flat stone, laid from wall to wall, about six feet in breadth, the width of the passage being somewhat less. The walls, where still intact, were covered with a coarse-grained hard plaster, and where broken, showed an enormous thickness of large stones, welded together with the same rough plaster.\n\nFrom the general form of these greater mounds I should think they had been pillared circular edifices with slightly domed or flat roofs. I saw no trace of carving on any of the blocks of stone lying about on these mounds. All that were so exposed were of huge size; but, though every block bore evidence of having been shaped, they were so worn by age, that no writing, however deep, could have remained. No doubt, as time wore on, the inhabitants have made use of these mounds as quarries, which may partly account for the\n\n---\n\n1 Vincent makes Gerrha to have been on the site of the present Katif, and as to deducing Tyrians and Aradians from the names of these Gulf islands, says simply, and rather unfairly, that it is consonant with the perpetual vanity of the Greeks, who reduce everything unknown to the standard of their own fabulous history. I think that this place may, amongst other reasons, have drawn importance from its situation with regard to the monsoon and the peculiar winds of the Gulf itself, as well as perhaps from the debouchure of a mouth of the Euphrates! With regard to this, see some account of monsoons, etc., in Vincent's preliminary observations to the \"Voyage of Nearchus.\"\nbare appearance of many of them, where no stone is left on the surface. Moreover, the stones that were buried may have fared better than their exposed comrades. With regard to the positions of the mounds themselves, I could see no trace of any unity of design in the grouping, except perhaps in one place, where four corner mounds seemed to be connected by a wall, and where, in the centre of the so-formed quadrangle, appears a mound of undefined shape, smaller, but resembling the others.\n\nSince writing the above I have opened a small mound, fifty-seven paces round, and nine or ten feet in height, to the westward of the large group, and have begun upon a larger one. Of the latter I will give an account presently. The small one is one of many hundreds that lie grouped together. It appears to be simply a single tomb, though oddly chambered. The centre passage was 4ft. 9in. high from the ground, and roofed with single slabs of rough hewn limestone stretching across about 3ft. 6in. each; the width of this passage being three feet clear. The height of the side chambers, which were only 3ft. 6in., combined with their shortness 3ft. 8in., as well as the fact that I found the skull between the thigh bones, shows that the man must have been buried in a sitting position.\n\nThe walls of the tomb were of rough hewn stone and unmortared, so that dust had drifted into the chambers, sifting in between the stones and covering much of the floor to a depth of several inches. I opened from the eastward, and came upon a central passage lying nearly east and west, a fact that I have since utilized in beginning my work on the larger mound. On carrying away the earth we found no entrance, but made one by removing large blocks of stone, luckily in the very centre of the big passage. From here we had to step down about three feet six inches, and found, at length, in the first compartment to the right (and north), the skull and bones of a man. Unfortunately a slight shake was given to the basket, after I had placed it carefully on one side, and the skull, though propped in dust, fell to pieces. Judging\nby the thigh bones, the man could not have stood much, if at all, over five feet nine inches. The skull seemed a very small one, specially low in the forehead, with a good development of the orbital ridge, narrow and more developed in length than in breadth, but still a small skull. It lay between the thigh bones, one of which was broken. This position of the skull, however, in conjunction with the lowness of the chamber and its want of depth, would seem to show that the corpse was buried in a sitting posture. In the small compartment facing the first we found the bones of some small animal, probably a gazelle or a sheep, and some remains of a rather delicate clay drinking vessel; while, scattered in the dust of the central passage, were a lot of small shapeless pieces of oxidized metal, brass or copper, and some fragments of a vessel of coarse red earthenware.\n\nIn the western and corresponding side chambers, both partially blocked by one or two large stones, nothing was found, except dust and a few laminated bones. These came out of the south-western chamber, but, with them, there was no skull or recognizable human bones. Here and there, scattered among the dust throughout the tomb, were pieces of what appeared to me to have been once ivory or wood; these being found on sifting the baskets of dust which came out when the tomb was being laid bare to its foundation stones.\n\nApril 6th, 1879.\u2014I can now give a further account of the larger mounds that I have been since engaged upon.\n\nIn the first place, I chose the most perfect looking of the large tumuli, the present height of which is about 45 feet, circumference 200 paces, and the circular mound around it 330 paces, 20 paces of level ground separating this latter from the base of the mound, with a line of wall joining the outer circle to the base of the mound.\n\nI naturally thought that this mound might cover the ruins of a small circular temple, and not those of a tomb. So we began to work at the top and centre, cutting down several yards. Finding, however, nothing but a ring of large\nstones, I left the top and began work again a few feet above the base, running a cutting into the mound and taking care to retain the same line east and west, having remarked a depression or shallow channel from the top to the bottom of the mound in this direction. Here, on going in a few feet, our progress was blocked by enormous stones, which appeared, on removal, to form part of a cyclopean circular containing wall. One of the blocks we had to break up with the crowbar measured roughly over six feet long, by three feet six broad, and eighteen inches deep.\n\nThe height of this wall above the ground level of my tunnel was about seven or eight feet, which would make it at least ten feet high from the level of the ground. The blocks used were unequal in size and unmortared.\u00b9\n\nOn breaking through this wall, I almost at once found myself in a passage or gallery, about six feet broad, and gradually narrowing (as I found afterwards) to five feet three inches at the inner end. The walls on either side were of rough, unmortared, and carelessly fitted stones, varying in size, but sloping pyramidally upwards from the encircling wall and also slightly outwards from their base. I picked my way between these containing walls, removing the earth as I went, and thus gradually clearing out the passage behind as we proceeded.\n\nThis increased the labour enormously, and was I believe unnecessary, from the compactness of the mass, the relative small size of our gallery, and the outward slope of the walls.\n\nA second barrier or inner wall, which blocked the entrance to the tomb itself was met with at a distance of thirty feet six inches from the first circular wall of blocks. On nearing this inner wall we found the passage on either side to be roughly mortared, and where the well-welded barrier forbade access, the wall on either\n\n\u00b9 Some of the outlying blocks on the other large mounds (already noticed) are of sandstone, and have been carefully shaped; perhaps the architects were equal to shaping sandstone, but not to shaping the harder limestone, or at any rate did not think that it was worth while to do so.\nside had two coats, one of rough and the other of smooth mortar, the latter underlying the former, which still here bore the marks of the plasterer's finger smears. The undercoat was of different material, and so smooth and hard that we had to use our picks to remove it. The transverse wall of cemented blocks had been built in apparently after the side-walls had been finished. We blew this out.\n\nFrom the platform on which these blocks were placed, a drop of three feet six inches brought us to the smooth and mortared floor of the tomb; here we turned up, among the stones and rubble masonry, a large amount of charcoal in such big pieces, that I think the roof must have been at one time supported by date tree trunks. Some pieces of a thinner character presented the appearance of bamboo-matting charred.\n\nOn the right and left of the passage were two shelves on either side, the lowest of which was carefully lined with mortar, but held nothing but yellow dust, with which they were filled up. These were four feet long, by eight inches in depth, and were at a height of six feet nine from the ground or platform. There is nothing to show to what use these shelves can have been put. On descending from the platform (the end of the passage) the walls carefully mortared still continued right and left for three feet two inches, and then turned at right angles, forming small mortuary chambers of the same shape as those in the lesser tomb previously described.\n\nThe dimensions of these chambers right and left of the passage are roughly seven feet three (length), by three feet three (breadth), and five feet six (height). From the interior walls of these chambers stretched back, through piles of rubble and fallen blocks, the side walls of a passage some four feet broader than the gallery by which we had entered.\n\nTo give an idea of the size of the stones used, there is a big mass now lying in the passage, probably a whole stone, and one of those that formed the roof, the dimensions of which are five feet long by four feet broad, and two feet nine in depth, and another lying alone in the left-hand side chamber, five feet\nlong by one foot ten thick. Of course, all round, over and under these, there are smaller masses buried in mortar, flints and earth. Though I searched most carefully, I found no marks of writing anywhere, not even a mason's mark on any of the stones.\n\nI think that the roof of the tomb, which, from the breadth of the central passage, could not be made of single transverse blocks, was unequal to supporting the weight of earth piled upon it, and had gradually slipped in.\n\nOut of all the number of large tombs, there is still one, though not the largest, which would, I believe, well repay further research.\n\nFrom October to April the climate of Bahrein is delightful, during the other months of the year it would be impossible to carry on work.\n\nNotes on Capt. Durand's Report upon the Islands of Bahrein. By Major-General Sir H. Rawlinson, K.C.B., F.R.S., President and Director of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nHaving been led by Capt. Durand's discoveries at Bahrein to look into the question of the antiquities of the Persian Gulf, I have been surprised to find how much new and interesting matter relating to this region has been accumulated since Vincent and Heeren conducted their investigations into \"the commerce and navigation of the ancients\"; and although, therefore, I have not sufficient leisure at my command at present to work out the inquiry as it deserves to be worked out, I have still thought that the notes collected during my desultory reading might be usefully submitted to a meeting of this Society, both with a view to the partial illustration of the subject, and more especially in the hope of suggesting lines of research to other and more competent students.\n\nThe importance, then, of this maritime region in the\nearliest period of the world's history may be inferred from the fact that, whereas Babylonia was mainly instrumental in imparting civilization to Western Asia, the Babylonians themselves admitted having received all their knowledge from the mysterious islanders of the Persian Gulf. The tradition preserved by Berosus, of Oannes, or \"the fish God,\" who came up from \"that part of the Erythrean Sea which borders on Babylonia,\" to teach the inhabitants of the country between the Tigris and Euphrates, \"letters and sciences and arts of every kind,\" evidently points to this period of primitive civilization. Oannes appears in the inscriptions as \"the creator of mankind\"; \"the God of knowledge\"; the lord of the primeval cities of Erid, of Surippak, and of Khalkha. He is usually known by the name of \"the God of the house of water,\" to which title I proposed many years ago to give the phonetic value of H\u00e9a, a provisional reading, which has remained in use ever since, though it has really very little except convenience to recommend it. The question then arises, who were these primitive \"fathers of knowledge,\" who first civilized the settlers on the Tigris and Euphrates, and whose memory was perhaps preserved in the legend of the Garden of Eden and the tree of knowledge? From many circumstances, which will be\n\n1 The late George Smith, in the third chapter of his \"Chaldaean Account of Genesis,\" p. 37, has extracted from Ctes's fragments most of the Greek notices referring to the early mythology and the primitive settlement of Babylonia, and has compared them in a somewhat perfunctory manner with the traditions preserved in the Cuneiform Inscriptions. His account of H\u00e9a or Oannes is at any rate far from satisfactory, and really adds very little to what I published on the subject twenty-two years ago in vol. i. of Rawlinson's Herodotus, p. 599. The great desideratum has been to find the Cuneiform original of the Greek \"\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2,\" but up to the present time the search has been unsuccessful. If Lenormant's conjecture had proved true that had the power of khan, the Accadian name for a fish being khanna, then we might have compared as a title of H\u00e9a with Oannes; but all the evidence goes to show that had the phonetic value of nun, and nothing else. The original name of H\u00e9a seems to have been Adu nuna, which probably meant \"the fish king.\" (See B.M.I. vol. ii. p. 31, No. 2, which is an etymological commentary on the Accadian text of an unrecovered portion of the \"fall\" Tablet; other portions of the same commentary which refer to the published text of the fall tablet, being included in B.M.I. vol. v. now almost ready for issue.)\ndetailed in the course of these notes, I judge that they were a dark race, the ancestors of the \"black-heads\" of the inscriptions, and possibly the same as the Adamites of Genesis. They clearly did not belong to what is called the Semitic family of nations, as there is hardly a name in the original mythology or geography of the region which can be traced to a Hebrew or Arabic root. They seem to have been of the same race, judging from their language, as the later Akkad of Babylonia; and it may be conjectured that they owed their early refinement to their position on the great line of traffic between the east and west. Commerce, indeed, has always sharpened the intelligence, and pioneered the way to civilization; and the same influences, which in a later age placed the Phoenicians at the head of European progress, may thus be supposed, at the first dawn of history, to have been in operation in the Persian Gulf. And here I may observe, that the reasons why, in very early times\u2014and even as late as the time of Alexander\u2014the emporia of commerce between India and the Mediterranean were to be found in the Persian Gulf, rather than on the southern coast of Arabia, or in the Red Sea, were simply these:\u20141st, that in the infancy of navigation mariners dared not strike directly across the Indian Ocean from the Malabar coast to Aden, but were obliged to creep along the shore from the mouth of the Indus to the entrance to the Persian Gulf; 2nd, that the Persian Gulf, with its varying winds, was always a far more convenient sea for navigation than the funnel-shaped Red Sea, where the wind blew for nine months continuously in one direction, and for three months in the other; and 3rd, that the valley of the Euphrates, and the northern skirts of\n\n---\n\n1 It is difficult of course in some cases to determine whether the Accadian or Assyrian rendering of a proper name may be the original form. For instance, the evil spirits, companions of Oannes, who are named by Berosus (following Berosus) \u1f18\u03ba\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 and \u1f18\u03ba-\u1f10\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03b6\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, appear in the Inscriptions as Vaddukku and Ergim in Assyrian, but Vaduk and Giggim in Accadian, which are mere variant forms of the same title, and probably signify \"the strikers\" and \"the ravagers;\" and I may add that \u1f18\u03ba\u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 is probably Ana-qaldu (Arabic \u0639\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0629 \"the destroyers\") the Greek labial as usual replacing the hard guttural, and \u1f18\u03ba-\u1f10\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03b6\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 may be Ana-rabul, \"the crouchers,\" the d and r interchanging. In this view Arhmartor will be the only one of the five monsters of Berosus unidentified.\nArabia (along the caravan route, for instance, from Gerrha to Palmyra), offered far greater facilities for inland transport to the west, than the hot trackless wastes of the centre of the peninsula. To these combined causes, then, it was owing that Milukh and Magan, Ophir and Gerrha, long maintained their commercial and maritime ascendency, to be succeeded in later times by Siraf and Keis, by Ormuz and Bassorah.\n\nHaving thus explained generally my view of the early condition of the Persian Gulf, I now enter upon particulars, relying mainly on the inscriptions of Assyria and Babylonia for a due illustration of the subject. The earliest available source of information is no doubt the Babylonian mythology. I have a strong suspicion that the worship of H\u00e9a or Oannes, which was introduced from the Persian Gulf, was originally distinct from, and perhaps antagonistic to, the worship of the two other Gods of the Triad, Anu and Bel, the cult of Anu being perhaps of native growth, while that of Bel was borrowed from the Eastern mountaineers, the famous \"the great mountain,\" which is always spoken of as \"the father of Bel,\" being the modern Kibir Koh, or outer range of Zagros, a name which has the same signification.1 Whether this distinction can or cannot be maintained\n\n1 For \"the great mountain,\" the father of Bel or Hu, second God of the Babylonian Triad, see B.M.I. iv. 18, 14; iv. 23, 30; iv. 27, 17; iv. 60, 23, and Smith's Discoveries, p. 392, Ins. line 7. This remarkable feature of the Babylonian mythology is named in one passage (iv. 27, 17) Im-kharris or Heaven's hill, and is described as \"reaching its head to heaven while its foundations touched the ab\u0161\u00fb,\" an indication which, if of any geographical value, will alone suit Kibir-koh, which stretches out its roots to the great lake at T\u00e1b. I was for some time under the impression that the Sadu rabu or \"great mountain\" of Bel was represented by the large mound at Niffer, which was especially Bel's city, and where the Ziggurat or Tower was named Bit-Im-kharris, \"the House of Heaven's Hill,\" but another research has satisfied me that \"the great mountain\" was a real physical feature, though often used in a mythical sense (as in B.M.I. iv. 60, 23, where the name is bracketed with Nidukki or Bahrein), and provisionally, therefore, I suggest Kibir-koh as its modern representative. Of course the sadu rabu, \"father of Bel,\" is quite distinct from the Sadu-rabu-matiti or Kharris-gal-kurkurru, in which almost all Assyrian scholars, except Smith, have insisted up to the present time on seeing a sort of Eastern Olympus, but which was in reality nothing more than the great national temple at Assur (or K\u00eel\u00eah Sherg\u00eet), with Necropolis attached, the mat aril\u00ee of Botti's Ins. 153, l. 12, and of B.M.I. vol. i. p. 32, 32. Bel was sometimes called \"the great mountain\" himself, and was enshrined with the other Gods and Goddesses, in the famous temple of Sadu-rabu-matiti at Assur. See Botti's Ins. pl. 131, l. 19.\nis not, however, of much consequence to my present argument, which is confined to H\u00e9a and his ocean domicile. He is best known as the Lord of the Ab\u015f\u00fa or \"abyss,\" a name which is usually applied in a sort of mythic sense to the \"waters under the earth\" of the Hebrews, but which also certainly indicated a geographical reality; being, in fact, the sea now called the Persian Gulf, and more specifically the great inland sea, which at different periods of history has spread over a more or less extent of the low country intervening between the salt sea shore and the higher land at the foot of the mountains. It is only at least by supposing an inland sea of this nature\u2014the \"Assyrium stagnum\" of Justin, and since greatly circumscribed by the gradual accretion of alluvial deposit from the rivers\u2014that I can explain how \"the blessed city,\" or Erid, H\u00e9a's chief seat of worship, and represented by the ruins of Tib, which are now more than 200 miles from the sea-coast, came to be designated \"the house of the Ab\u015f\u00fa,\" \u1e2aal\u1e2ba, which, as the name never occurs in the accounts of the Assyrian military expeditions, I suppose to have been an island in the Gulf, and which, accordingly, I venture to compare with \u1e2aarak or Karrak, a name that may, I think, be also recognized in the \u1f08\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1 of Ptolemy, off the Persian coast, and the Aracia of Pliny, the\n\n1 See B.M.I. vol. iv. p. 45, l. 35. In the same passage, \u1e2aal\u1e2ba, the Accadian name for the ab\u015f\u00fa, is explained as \"the abode of knowledge,\" Bit-nimikki, in reference, no doubt, to the primitive colonists who came from the Persian Gulf.\n\n2 See No. 1, l. 27 of Deluge tablet. I call Surippak an inland town because neither in ancient nor in modern times has a city ever been built on the sea-shore at the mouth of a great river like the Euphrates, for the simple reason that in such a position the city would be buried under alluvial deposit in the course of a very few years. Surippak is mentioned as late as the time of Hammuragas, about B.C. 1500, but not later. See Smith's \"Early History of Babylon,\" Journ. of Soc. of Bib. Arch., vol. i. p. 59, where, however, the name is expressed under its Accadian form of Mairu (for Mazu).\nlatter author adding the special description \"cum monte praetato, Neptuno sacra.\" 1\n\nAs the Persian alphabet always substituted an r for the Semitic l, Harak would naturally represent the Babylonian Khalakh or Khalkha, which name is given as the seat of the god H\u00e9a in B.M.I. vol. ii. p. 60, l. 22, this notice being, moreover, confirmed by the phrase \"the Lord Bull, king of Khalakh,\" which is found among the titles of H\u00e9a on an unpublished fragment in the British Museum.\n\nYac\u00fat's account of Kharak is interesting. He says, \"It is an island in the Persian Gulf (Bahar-el Fars), which looks like a lofty mountain (the \"monte praetato\" of Pliny, and the height being really 280 feet) in the middle of the sea. When a vessel leaves 'Abadan (at the mouth of the Euphrates) for Oman, and the wind is favourable, it will reach Kharak in a day and night. It is included in the dependencies of Fars, and is situated out in the sea opposite to Janndbeh and Mihriy\u00e1n, the one position being visible from the other with a good sight, whilst the mountains inland are always clearly to be seen from the island. I have often visited the place, and found on it a tomb, to which they make pilgrimages and offer vows, the islanders pretending that it is the tomb of Muhammad Ibn El Hanifeh, though this is contrary to history.\"\n\nNow it is quite possible, I think, in view of that persistency of tradition which is so marked in the East, that this pilgrimage to a spurious shrine may be a relic of the old sailor-worship of H\u00e9a. There is indeed to be seen at the present day, in the centre of the island of Kharak, a rude cave-temple, which bears marks of the remotest antiquity,\n\n1 B.M.I. vol. ii. p. 60, l. 21. Ptolemy calls Aracia the Island of Alexander, but for what reason is not apparent. His island of Tabiana in the immediate vicinity was named after the river Tab, and his Ta\u00f6ey represents of course the \u062a\u0627\u067e of the Persians. The Achaemenid Palace of Ta\u00f6oe, mentioned by Strabo, was probably at the modern village of Dabat, which is a fine ruin of great apparent antiquity, but the most promising site for excavation in that part of Persia would seem to be at the village of Hindiden on the Tab river, where, according to the traveller Moser Ibn Mohalhai, there were in his time (tenth century) \"wonderful remains and magnificent buildings, from which they excavated buried treasures as they do in Egypt, together with temples of marvellous workmanship and Pyres.\" The ruins still exist, as I have heard, between the two arms of the river about one stage south of Behukan.\nthough the traces of a cross and a half-obliterated Syrian inscription show that in later times it must have been used as a Christian hermitage. Geographical commentators have been usually content to identify Kharak with the \u1f38\u03ba\u03b1\u03c0\u03cc\u03c2 or \u1f38\u03c7\u03ac\u03c0\u03b1 of the Greeks, where there was a shrine to Apollo and Diana, but the measurements are quite unsuitable. Icarus, so named, it is said, by Alexander, was found by Archias, the king's first exploring officer sent from Babylon, to be only distant 120 stadia (ten or twelve miles) from the mouth of the Euphrates; and the evidence of Androsthenes, who conducted a later survey, further shows that it was close to the Arabian coast. It has probably been long ago absorbed in the new land of the Bubian Island, formed by the continued deposit of alluvium, and it is useless, therefore, now to search for the site. It is a subject of more interest, as indicating the line of advance by which the primitive Turanian colony must have approached the Euphrates, to observe that Nearchus passed another island sacred to Neptune (H\u00e9a or Oannes), as far east as Oaracta or Kishm, so that the inference would seem to be, that the first immigrants came from the Indian Ocean, but whether from India itself, or from Egypt by the Red Sea and the southern coast of Arabia, cannot at present be decided. On one side there is the remarkable tradition preserved by Diodorus that \"Belus, the son of Neptune (i.e. Merodach, the son of H\u00e9a), led a colony from Egypt into the province of Babylon, and fixing his seat on the river Euphrates, consecrated Priests, whom the Babylonians call Chaldeans, and who observe the motions of the stars in\n\n---\n\n1 Vincent, in his Commerce and Navigation of the Ancients, vol. i. p. 522, would identify the Icarus visited by Archias with the island of Pelicheh off Grane Harbour, but admits that the distance does not correspond; while he supposes Ptolemy's Ichare to be a distinct island and one of the Bahrein group. When we consider the enormous extent of new land, at least fifty miles in length, that has been formed near the mouth of the Euphrates since the time of Alexander, it must be evident that it is a hopeless task to attempt to verify the Greek measurements by a comparison with modern distances.\n\n2 Vincent supposes Neptune's Island, noticed by Nearchus, to be the modern Angar, or as it is now called Hinjim, but Angar or Argan is almost necessarily Organa, and Neptune's Island, seen from it in the offing, can only be, I think, the Greater Tomb. Argan or Hinjim, where we now have a telegraph station, is, it must be remembered, exactly in the line of navigation up the Gulf and close to Kishm, so that it could not possibly be described as \"an islet in the offing.\"\nimitation of the Priests and Astrologers of Egypt.\" On the other side, it is to be noted that native tradition, as preserved by a certain Semironius of Babylon, who is quoted by the author of the Paschal Chronicle, described the famous primitive teacher of Astronomy to the Babylonians as Andubarus the Indian, this name of Andubar applying to the mythical personage usually called Izdubar by Assyriologists, whose adventures, as translated by George Smith, have recently created so much interest amongst Oriental and Biblical students. In the name of \\(\\text{Andabar}\\) we have for the first element \\(\\text{An}\\), a God, and secondly, Dubar or Thubar (Arabic \\(\\text{\u062b\u0639\u0628\u0627\u0646}\\) 'a sort of palm-tree'), preceded by the determinative of wood, which, as usual, is not pronounced. Andubar, as I long ago pointed out, was the impersonation of the Sun; this identification being rendered certain by the hymn translated by Smith (Discoveries, p. 394), where all the usual solar epithets, \"judge of mankind, etc.,\" are applied to the hero in question, and his twelve cantos, illustrating the sun's passage through the twelve signs of the Zodiac, may thus have well been considered as a popular introduction to Astronomy. There was also a saying familiar amongst the people of the Sowad at the time of the Arab invasion, and which the early traditionists repeated without understanding, that Niffer was the original Babil, Modain was Ctesiphon, and Abilah (the port of entry at the mouth of the Euphrates) was a dependency of Hind or India, this connexion of the two names seeming to point to the original immigration.\n\nBut the worship of Hea or Neptune was not the only cult\n\n---\n\n1 See Diod. Sic. lib. i. cap. 2. It has also occurred to me that the epithet \\(\\mu\\alpha\\gamma\\alpha\\beta\\iota\\sigma\\), applied to Oannes by Berossus, and hitherto unexplained, may possibly represent the ethnic title Musari, or Egyptian, in allusion to the nationality of the primitive colony.\n\n2 The curious passage I transcribe at length: \"\u0395\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c7\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03bf\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u1ff7 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u1ff3 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u0391\u03c1\u03c0\u03b1\u03be\u03ac\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f26\u03bd \u1f15\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f08\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf\u03cd\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f08\u03c1\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f10\u03ba\u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03cd\u03b8\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd \u1f51\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f08\u03c1\u03c0\u03b1\u03be\u03ac\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5, \u1f61\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u1f04\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u1f30\u03b4\u03af\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03c0\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c2.\u2014Pesch. Chron. ed. Huguet, vol. i. p. 64. Observe that although Andobar is said to have taught the Indians, the whole chapter copied from Semironius relates to Babylonian tradition, and the name of Arphaxad, who was the supposed father of the Chaldeans, points in the same direction. It was common to name teachers after trees; thus the progenitor of Manes was named Budda or 'the Terebinth tree.'\n\n3 I omit in verse \\(\\text{\u0391\u03b3\u03b3\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2}\\).\nintroduced by the primitive \"black-heads\" into Babylonia. The Persian Gulf was equally famous for the worship of the sun, and for that of the sun's closest attendant, the planet Mercury, the latter being the cult with which the Bahrein discoveries are more immediately connected. With regard to the sun-worship I may refer, firstly, to the report of Alexander's officers that the island of Icarus, in the northern part of the Persian Gulf, was sacred to Apollo and Diana, and, secondly, to Ptolemy's notice of the \u1f38\u03b5\u03c0\u03b1 \u1f21\u03bb\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f04\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1 on the Arabian coast, somewhat further to the south, while in respect to the Cuneiform evidence I may note that, besides many passages which seem to connect the sun directly with Niduk-ki or Bahrein, there is the whole series of the adventures of Izdubar (or more properly \"Andubar the Indian\"), which, belonging to the period of the primitive Babylonian colonization, certainly represent the solar myth, and may thus be received as an indication of the original faith. In respect to Mercury, however, the evidence is far more weighty and direct. The inscription, indeed, on Captain Durand's famous black stone discovered at Bahrein, forms the ground-work of the argument. It is written in what is usually called Hieratic Babylonian, and may be transliterated as follows: Hekal Rimugas, eri-Inzak, Aqiru, i.e. \"The Palace of Rimugas, the servant of Mercury, of the tribe of Ogyr.\" It is important to note that the name of Rimugas is of undoubted Accadian etymology, the ending in s being a marked peculiarity of the pre-Semitic names, while Inzak is given in a bilingual fragment as the Accadian name for Nebo or Mercury, as worshipped at \u1e62\u016br or Bahrein. But there was still another divinity worshipped in the Persian Gulf, who was probably of more importance than any of those already noticed. The Greeks of Alexander's time called this divinity Venus, and associated her with\n\n1 Compare especially B.M.I. vol. iv. p. 60, col. 1, lines 23, 24, 26, and 38; and it is not impossible but that \u1f38\u03b5\u03c0\u03b1 \u1f21\u03bb\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f04\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1, who was certainly one of the Gods of Nidukshi (B.M.I. vol. iv. p. 25, l. 18), may be a form of the Sun-god, being joined with Rissaba, which was another name for the sun, in B.M.I. vol. ii. p. 60, lines 66, 67.\n\n2 Compare B.M.I. vol. ii. p. 54, l. 65, restored from duplicate copy, with B.M.I. vol. ii. p. 60, l. 30.\nMercury or Inzak, whose wife, in Babylonia, was known by the name of Tasmit; but in the Inscriptions she is named Lakhamun, and is identified with Ziru-panit, who was the wife of Merodach, and the tutelar Goddess of Babylon, another instance of the same confusion between the wife of Merodach and the wife of Nebo or Mercury occurring in the name of Pap-nun, which belonged alike to Ziru-panit and to Tasmit. Now the precise form of Lakhamun is not found in any other passage of the Inscriptions excepting that which gives this name to the Venus of Bahrein, a circumstance which is, to say the least of it, remarkable, considering the extent and completeness of the various mythological lists, whilst the name, however, of Lakhamu, which is almost identical, is of common occurrence, belonging, as is well known from the Creation tablets and other sources, to the \"great mother\" or \"female principle of nature,\" and thus perfectly suiting the Ziru-panit of Nidukki. I am disposed then to think that Lakhamu and Lakhamun are variant forms of the same name, and that the tutelar Goddess of Bahrein was in fact the same divinity.\n\n1 For the benefit of Assyrian students I quote the various passages where these equivalent readings severally occur: (a) Lakhmun = Ziru-panit of Nidukki, B.M.I. vol. ii. p. 54, l. 68, restored from duplicate copy. (b) i.e. Lakhamu or Lakhamu, as the \"female principle of Nature\" (same as Anata, wife of Anu), B.M.I. vol. ii. p. 54, l. 9, vol. iii. p. 59, l. 15, and Creation Tablet, l. 10. (c) Pap-nun, gloss for Tasmit, B.M.I. vol. ii. p. 48, l. 39, but \"Pap-nun (great giver?) of heaven and earth\" is a name for Ziru-panit, B.M.I. vol. ii. p. 54, l. 64, restored from duplicate, and is applied to the same Goddess as wife of Merodach, B.M.I. vol. iv. p. 21, l. 52; whereas in an unpublished list \"Pap-nun of heaven and earth\" is wife of \"the proclaimer of good fortune,\" who was a mere secondary form of Nebo, or Mercury, see B.M.I. vol. iii. p. 66, col. 3, l. 30, and col. 7, l. 29, and B.M.I. vol. iv. p. 59, l. 43.\n\n* If Lakhamun were a genuine reading, it might be explained as \"the messenger of Ammon\" (lakh = pukkat), and would seem to have been borrowed from Egypt, like Huran, Bar, Parris, and several other names common in Egyptian and Babylonian divinities; but I cannot venture to generalize on a single example.\nwho was in a later age worshipped in Babylonia under at least three different forms, namely, Ziru-panit, wife of Merodach; Tasmit, wife of Nebo; and Gula, wife of Ninip, the Assyrian Hercules. The attributes at any rate of Gula, who in the general lists is sometimes bracketed with Lakhmu, the male principle of nature, are exactly suited to the Goddess of Bahrein; for she is, 1st, \"the great mother (ummu alidat or 'genetrix') of the black-heads,\" 2nd, she is \"the Queen of Karrak,\" \"she who blesses the tomb\" (abrikkat aralli); and 3rd, she is \"the Queen of life,\" \"she who resuscitates the dead,\" the lady in fact of the resurrection, and the Goddess accordingly around whose shrine the \"the black-heads\" or Erythreans would naturally desire to be buried; precisely as at the present day the Persian sectaries desire to be buried at Kerbela and Nejef, not so much out of respect to the tombs of the martyred Imams, as because the last judgment is traditionally expected to take place in the Wadi-as-Sal\u0101m in the immediate neighbourhood; and I may add, as a parallel case, that I attribute the multitude of ancient graves at Wark\u0101 or Huruk to the celebrity of the neighbouring shrine of Istar, who, as another representative of the productive power of nature, was also probably supposed to preside over the resurrection; and here it becomes necessary to take up the general geographical\n\n---\n\n1 A few references seem to be here required. Gula is associated with Lakhmu (to be distinguished from Lakhamu), apparently as man and wife, on a fragment in the Museum giving a very complete list of the Gods, and as yet unpublished. For her title as 'great mother of the black-heads,' see B.M.I. vol. iv. p. 61, l. 27, where she is joined with or Ninip, her usual partner, either under his own name or under the secondary form of Damu. Her best-known title is Lady of Nis\u012bnna or Karrak, which was probably the same place as the Karaka of the list of Darius, and the Charax of late geography (modern Mohamrah, near the mouth of the Euphrates), see B.M.I. vol. ii. p. 51, l. 34, and compare B.M.I. vol. iv. p. 63, lines 15 and 21. For her title of Mayetum, \"she who restrains the demons,\" see B.M.I. vol. iv. p. 19, l. 8, and B.M.I. vol. iii. p. 31, and p. 62, l. 15. From the many images indeed in which she is invoked, it is evident she was considered the arbitrator of life and death, see Michaux Stone, col. 4, l. 5, B.M.I. vol. iii. p. 41, l. 29, and p. 43, col. 4, l. 16. It must be admitted that there is no evidence to connect Gula directly with Nidakki or Bahrein, though it is tolerably certain that her worship prevailed extensively in the Persian Gulf.\nquestion which is so closely connected with the mythological\nthat the one is unintelligible without a due knowledge of the\nother.\n\nLet it be understood then that throughout the Assyrian\ntablets, from the earliest period to the latest, there is constant\nallusion to an island called \\( \\text{Niduk-ki} \\) in\nAccadian, and \\( \\text{Tilteun or Tilmun} \\) in Assyrian,\\(^1\\) and\nthat this name, which unquestionably applies to Bahrein, is so\nfrequently associated with two others, \\( \\text{Milukh} \\) and \\( \\text{Magan} \\), or\n\\( \\text{Makkan} \\), that the three places may be assumed with certainty\nto be in the same neighbourhood.

What I\nhave here to do is to show that there was an \u201ceastern\u201d as well\nas a \u201cwestern\u201d \\( \\text{Milukh} \\) and \\( \\text{Magan} \\), and that the two names in\nEastern Geography indicated two ports in the Persian Gulf,\nwhich must have been contiguous to Bahrein.\\(^3\\) The evidence\n\n\\(^1\\) The meaning of the Accadian name \\( \\text{Nidukki} \\) may be either \u2018possessing altars\u2019\nor \u2018possessing a God,\u2019 for the letter \\( \\text{N} \\) used as a monogram, has both signifi-\ncations, and either of these would be suitable to the holy character of the island;\nbut it is difficult to find a similar signification for the Assyrian equivalent \\( \\text{Tilteun} \\)\nor \\( \\text{Tilmun} \\), if we are restricted to a Semitic etymology. It is quite possible,\nhowever, that \\( \\text{Tilmun} \\) may be an adopted name, \\( \\text{Ti} \\) being allied to \\( \\text{Tila} \\), a\nTuranian correspondent to \\( \\text{Akkad} \\) \u2018high lands,\u2019 and \\( \\text{mun} \\) being explained in\nSyllabary 156 by \\( \\text{dabti} \\) \u2018favour or blessing,\u2019 so that the meaning of the name\nmight be \u2018the blessed hill\u2019 or perhaps \u2018the blessed isle.\u2019\n\n\\(^2\\) See Journal of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, vol. vi., pp. 348 and 399.\nM.

In all the geographical lists, as well as in the classification of ships and products, the names of Nidukki, Milukh, and Magan are associated with a uniformity which it would be impossible to explain if the one place were in the Persian Gulf, and the others in the Mediterranean. There is indeed no conceivable reason why in these lists\u2014some of them very ancient\u2014which relate exclusively to Babylonia, Assyria, and their dependencies, remote Egyptian names should be introduced.\n\nThe brought round to the Persian Gulf by the original immigrants from the Red Sea, and might thus be justified in searching for an etymology in the dialects of the Valley of the Nile. Lenormant at one time suggested a direct Semitic derivation for Milukh by comparing it with the Hebrew \u05de\u05dc\u05d7 \u2018salt,\u2019 and curiously enough the town of Gerha was actually built of blocks of rock-salt, so that the name, if thus derived, would be most appropriate to the locality; but such an explanation would take no account of the contrast between Magan and Milukh, and I cannot therefore accept it. Still less can I approve of Lenormant\u2019s later reading of Keslukh (Biblical Casluhim) instead of Milukh (Journ. Bib. Arch. vol. vi. p. 402). I would prefer to derive Milukh from a root resembling \u05de\u05dc\u05d7, though probably Egyptian rather than Assyrian. With regard to Ophir and Apirak, which I have ventured to regard as synonyms of Milukh, there is much uncertainty. Khopir is doubtless given in the Bible, iii. p. 50, l. 51, as an Accadian term for \u2018Highland\u2019; but I find it difficult to identify with it, and for this is a more modified form of Khopir, or Apir, or Apar (Ezra iv. 9), which was the vernacular name of the Susians or Elamites; for the full name of the country inhabited by these tribes was Khalipirti, Naksh-i-Rustam Ins. l. 17 (which appears almost unaltered in the \u03a7\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03c0\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 of Ptolemy adjoining \u039a\u03b5\u03c1\u03c3\u03af\u03b1), and the other forms of Khalipirti, Khopirti, Khopir, and Apar, were mere degradations of the original title, a still further corruption having survived in Lepet, which was the name applied to the city of Ahwaz at late as the Arab conquest (compare J. Dinseri, vol. ii. p. 509). I think it safer not to attempt to connect Ophir and Apirak etymologically with the Susan Apirak, but to be content with showing that, whatever may have been the meaning of the names, the two places\u2014that is, 1st, the port visited by the fleets of Solomon, and which, in Genesis x. 29, is bracketed with Havilah at the mouth of the Euphrates; and 2nd, the country taken by Naram-Sin (together with Magan) after the conquest of Nidukki\u2014must have been on the Arabian coast opposite to Bahrein, and most possibly at or near the spot afterwards occupied by Gerha. And I may conclude my remarks on the subject by suggesting that the name of Hopir, which is given in the list of Nidukki or Tilmon in the Annals of the second Sargon, may possibly reproduce the original title of the great emporium of commerce in the immediate neighbourhood, which was usually expressed in Hebrew by \u05de\u05dc\u05d7.\n\nFor notices of Nidukki see B.M.I. vol. ii. p. 46, lines 5, 48; vol. ii. p. 51, l. 17; vol. ii. p. 53, l. 11; vol. iii. p. 60, l. 18; vol. iii. p. 4, l. 70, restored from duplicate; vol. iv. p. 60, passim; vol. iv. p. 25, l. 18. In an unpublished fragment containing an interesting geographical list, two names are found as correspondents to Nidukki, Tilmon and Asni, \u05d0\u05e1\u05e0\u05d9, immediately followed by Magan and Milukh. Asni is otherwise unknown, but may represent the lesser island of Bahrein.\n\nSee especially B.M.I. vol. iv. p. 38, lines 13, 14. In the very curious list of countries and their descriptive titles, B.M.I. vol. ii. p. 51, it is very probable that\nearliest mention of *Nidukki* probably occurs in the great Astrological work, which appears to have been composed before the institution of the Assyrian empire, as the name of Assur never once occurs in it, but the only geographical indication therein contained is that *Nidukki* must have been to the east of Babylon. In the mythological tablet, published in B.M.I. vol. iv. pl. 60, *Nidukki* is frequently spoken of, but apparently in a mythical sense, being associated with \"the great mountain\" of Bel, with the mysterious Bull, with the sun-worship, and generally with the East in a most perplexing manner. The first historical notice of the place occurs on a tablet giving an account of the great Sargon's career (about 1600 B.C., according to Smith), where the king is said to have reached \"the lower sea\" or Persian Gulf, and the country of \"the black-heads,\" and to have reduced *Nidukki*, and another sea-port of which the name is incomplete; and this notice is of the more importance as in what appears to be the continuation of the same campaign on another tablet, Sargon's son, Naramsin, is said to have conquered *Ris-bin*, the king of Apirak, and his ally the king of Magan, whose name however is lost. Now the Magan and Apirak here named, and which are possibly again mentioned on the Naramsin vase obtained by M. Freer, and since lost, cannot by any possibility belong to Egypt, but must certainly be sought for in the Persian Gulf. In my view, then, *Apirak*\u2014or, without the Accadian augment, *Apri*\u2014answering to the Biblical \"Ophir,\" was probably situated either at Katif or Gerrha, and was the same place as *Nidukki*, both of these names perhaps signifying \"the\n\nThe two names in line 18, which follow *Magan* and *Milukk*, refer to the Bahrain islands, *Saggis* = *Sagga* = *Sagga*, and the other *Saggis* = *Sagga* = *Sagga*. The title \"region of springs\" exactly suits Capt. Durand's description.\n\nMr. Smith's translation of the Sargon tablet, restored from a duplicate copy, and read at the Society of Biblical Archaeology, vol. i. p. 46, and his translation of the Naramsin record in the same paper, p. 51. With regard to his reading of *Magan* and *Kassu* for the two names on the Naramsin vase, I entirely agree. I repeatedly studied the inscription from the original vase, and noticed that the first letter of the fifth line was *Y* (as indeed it is printed, B.M.I. vol. i. p. 3, No. viii.), from a squeeze which I then took; and I am quite sure that this character is *apsi*.\nupper,\u201d in contradistinction to Magan, \u201cthe lower.\u201d At whatever precise spot this port may have been situated, it was no doubt from the very earliest times the emporium of Indian commerce, and on this account attracted the navies of Solomon, the articles with which his ships were loaded being, as is well known, Indian both in name and character. The sister port of Magan seems to have given its name to the God who was worshipped there, and who was either \u201cthe Sun,\u201d or his attendant Mercury, and the God\u2019s name must in later times have applied to the port itself, for Marwada is laid down in Ptolemy\u2019s chart, which was taken from the Roman traders of the time, at the entrance of the Sinus Gerraicus, where is now found the village of Dhelum, answering to the Dhelama of the Arab geographers. It is only necessary to state further, in reference to Nidakki or Tilmun, that its identification with Bahrein is further shown by the well-known passage in the annals of the younger Sargon, where the submission is described of Hupir, the king of the islands, who dwelt like a fish in the sea, at the distance of 30 kaspu or \u201cdouble hours\u201d (equal to about 210 English miles) from the mouth of the Euphrates, a measurement which is strictly accurate.\n\nTo return, now, to the mythological part of the subject, the identification of the God Inzak is of great interest. On Capt. Durand\u2019s stone the name is written with which we must compare the form given as the equivalent of \u201cNebo of\n\n---\n\n1 The augment of locality is found in many of the old Accadian names, such as Assurak, Surippak, Susinak, Apirk, etc. It is probably a relic of ki \u2018place.\u2019 Sayce has shown some reason for regarding Apir, the vernacular name of Susiana, as a synonym of Numma or Elam \u2018upper\u2019 (Journ. Bibl. Arch. vol. iii. p. 468), and Magan is certainly used in B.M.I. vol. iv. p. 13, l. 16, for \u2018lower,\u2019 in contradistinction to eliti or \u2018upper.\u2019\n\n2 I used to consider all the names in the fragment, B.M.I. vol. iii. p. 69, lines 53-58, from Mitra to Bisba, as titles for the \u2018sun\u2019 and I then supposed Magan to be the same as ina sumu \u2018the lower of heaven,\u2019 an epithet constantly applied to the sun (B.M.I. vol. iv. p. 29, l. 25, and Bibl. Arch. vol. v. p. 438 and vol. vi. p. 383); but it seemed impossible that \u2018the dark God,\u2019 Itu zalam, which is used for the shadow of the sun in B.M.I. vol. i. p. 18, l. 44, could also represent the sun itself; and I prefer, therefore, now referring all the names, excluding Bisba, to Mercury. I may add that the title of \u2018the dusky God\u2019 very possibly survives in the modern village of Dhelum.\nNidukki,\" in B.M.I. vol. ii. p. 54, l. 66. This name of Inzak, however, is composed of two elements, In, \"a Lord,\" and zak, \"the first or nearest,\" a variant of the title, Uzak, being thus given in B.M.I. vol. ii. p. 60, l. 30, among the titles of Nebo, with the translation of bil asaridu, or \"Lord, the nearest.\" This title of Asaridu was probably given to Mercury, because he was the nearest planet to the sun. Another Accadian compound for the same word asaridu was (see Smith's Alphabet, No. 94, 2), and we are fully justified, therefore, in applying to Mercury the planetary title of (B.M.I. vol. ii. p. 49, l. 42), which has hitherto been usually referred to Saturn; this identification, again, leads to further explanations, for (literally \"the nearest star to the sun\") is stated to be the same as or \"the dark God,\" who is noticed in B.M.I. vol. iv. p. 25, l. 18, as the special God of Nidukki.\n\nNo doubt the title of \"the dark God\" (Assyr. Ilu salmi, B.M.I. vol. ii. p. 49, l. 42, and vol. iii. p. 69, l. 66), was given to Mercury on account of its close propinquity to the sun, the star being, according to the Latin astronomers, \"perustus aut solatus\" (and for the same reason Nebo is often styled in the Inscriptions or emuk liti, \"steeped in flame,\" and is even confounded with the \"spirit of fire,\" who seems, nevertheless, astronomically to have been properly identified with the lightning); and\n\n1 Asaridu, which is given in the lists as the equivalent both of (read by Lenormant as Sag-gis), usually means 'the first' or 'chief' or 'eldest,' but 'nearest' seems to be also quite a legitimate rendering. The etymology is unknown, but I conjecture it to be the word from which the Arabs have derived their name of Atarid, for Mercury, by substituting the ain for atif, and hardening the shibant, as in Atiktar for Istar or Venus, Atatur for Mars, etc.\n\n* See B.M.I. vol. ii. p. 60, l. 38. The most direct identification of Nebo with the Fire God occurs in the inscription on the famous tablet which gives the numerical value of the Assyrian deities, and which, though often quoted, has never, I believe, been published in extenso. Here the last God of the second division, which must necessarily answer to Nebo, is named\nherein we probably see the origin and explanation of the Greek stories about King Erythras and the Erythrean Sea. It is quite certain that the colossal tumuli discovered and partially opened by Capt. Durand on the larger island of Bahrein represent the tomb of Erythras on the island of Tyrine, or Ogyris, which attracted the notice of Alexander's officers. The geographical evidence of identity is quite complete, and the description of the spot given by Orthagoras, \"on a lofty mound covered with wild palms,\" would suit the locality at the present day.\u00b9 The only point which is difficult of decision seems to be whether the far-famed tomb of Erythras, \"the red king,\" was a temple of Inzak (or Mercury, \"the dusky God\"), or whether there may not have been a real sepulchre on the island of some early king of the \"black-heads,\" whose name was used as the eponym of his race.\u00b2 It was the dusky or swarthy colour of the primitive colonists which the Greeks translated by Erythrean, and which probably led the islanders to take \"the dusky God\" as their tutelar divinity; for the monogram \u1f18-\u03a0-\u039d-\u03a3 by which Nebo of Nidukki was distinguished is explained in one of the Cuneiform syllabaries as Sagga-gunu, that is, \"head-colour,\" or \"reddish brown\";\u00b3 and curiously enough the character in question has also the two syllabic values of Sur and Kus, the one value having possibly suggested that connexion with the Syrians of the Mediterranean which so sorely puzzled the Greeks, while the other pointed less obscurely to\n\n\u00b9 Strabo, p. 766.\n\u00b2 Artemidorus, as quoted by Strabo, p. 779, alludes to this eponymous character of Erythras, when he says that some of the natives called him a son of Perseus, who formerly reigned in these parts.\n\u00b3 Syllabary 483 and B.M.I. vol. ii. p. 21, l. 41. In the latter passage sur is the gloss for Izuu, \u1f21\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1 'the red-brown goat,' or \u1f18-\u03a0-\u039d-\u03a3 (Capricorn or Tebeth), which Sayce calls 'the double ship'! Assyriologists do not seem to have discovered that the gunu of the lists is everywhere 'colour' (Chald. \u1f21\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1), and that the ideographic representative was usually the prefix \u1f18-, as in \u1f18-\u03a0-\u039d-\u03a3 'a fish,' \u1f18-\u03a0-\u039d-\u03a3 'fish-colour,' \u1f18-\u03a0-\u039d-\u03a3 'a head,' \u1f18-\u03a0-\u039d-\u03a3 'head-colour,' \u1f18-\u03a0-\u039d-\u03a3 'mud-colour' (?), \u1f18-\u03a0-\u039d-\u03a3, etc.\n\nVOL. XII.\u2014[NEW SERIES.]\na derivation from the Kush or Asiatic Ethiopians of Herodotus and Strabo, who dwelt in the same region. The rationalizing Greeks, who evidently looked upon King Erythras as a myth, attempted to explain the name of the Erythrean Sea by the ruddy reflexion on the waves of the rays of a vertical sun, or by the colour of the adjoining mountains, reddened by the intensity of the heat;\u00b9 but the colour of the islanders, as it seems to me, offers a far more plausible solution of the difficulty. I shall not here critically discuss the question whether there really ever was any ethnic connexion between the islanders of the Persian Gulf and the founders of the Mediterranean sea-ports of Tyre and Sidon, because there is no direct evidence either for or against such a supposition to be derived from the inscriptions. The supposed similarity of name between Tylus and Aradus in the Persian Gulf, and Teur and Aread on the Phoenician coast, will not bear a moment's serious examination;\u00b2 but at the same time I see nothing improbable in the Turanian immigrants who first colonized Babylonia from the Gulf, having subsequently pushed on to the westward till they reached the shores of the Mediterranean, and formed that confederacy of cities on the sea-coast, which belonged (many centuries anterior to a Semitic settlement) to the Philistines of the Bible, a Turanian race immediately cognate with the Canaanites and Hittites. If any dependence is to be placed on the information given by the priests of Tyre to Herodotus, that the Temple of Hercules had been founded 2300 years before his visit,\u2014and viewed by the light of recent discovery as to the extreme antiquity of the historic monuments of Egypt and Babylonia, I can see no improbability in the statement,\u2014this great Turanian immigration must have set\n\n\u00b9 See Strabo, loc. cit.\n\u00b2 Before quitting the subject of Nidukki, I may allude to a curious passage in B.M.I. vol. ii. p. 60, col. 3, which seems to refer to some fabulous voyage of the king of the island, in a ship built for the purpose. The passage is too imperfect to be made out clearly, and the geographical names are in most cases uncertain; but I am strongly of opinion that the list is intended to correspond a sort of Periplute of the Erythrean Sea. The catalogue of names reads as follows: Nidukki, Niburu, Guji, Suli . . . Istar offspring of Nyara, Nyara offspring of Nyira, mountains of Purru . . . Pasiri, Pasa . . . Tobar, Khilisha . . . Khilishana, Kumad . . . Tilikhasbat, Sandarippi, Si . . . , and Bapi.\nin at least 5000 years ago. Of course it was not accomplished at one time, or in one wave. All colonization, both in Europe and in Western Asia, seems to have followed the same line of movement, and the particular migration from Bahrain to Tyre may have been only one of several successive removals. It is certainly a remarkable proof of the persistency of tradition among the Assyrians of their civilization being derived from the Persian Gulf, that Nebo, the special guardian of \"the dusky race,\" and the tutelar god of Bahrain, is always spoken of in the Assyrian mythology as the inventor of the system of Cuneiform writing. I have sometimes fancied, indeed, that the entire line of immigration might be traced by following the records of local worship. For instance, the cult of Nebo, \"the burnt or dusky god,\" may have been originally established at Bahrain as a protecting influence against the volcano (or Jabal Dukhan, \"mountain of smoke\"), still to be seen in the island, for, according to Justin, it was to escape the earthquakes, caused no doubt by this terror of nature, that the first emigrants left the island. H\u00e9a's shrine at Khalakh, or Kharak, would then form the next historical step in the progress of the colony; from whence, according to the same tradition, the emigrants passed on to the \"Assyrian stagnum,\" just as we find that H\u00e9a, sprung from \u1e62\u0101r\u016b, \"the primeval spirit of the deep,\" fixed his first capital at the blessed city Erid or T\u016bb, on the northern shore of the inland sea or ab\u0161\u0113, the locality having, indeed, preserved its sacred character almost to the present day. H\u00e9a, or Oannes, it must\n\n1 See, among other passages, B.M.I. vol. ii. p. 60, l. 34. A dissertation of some extent, if not of much interest, on Nebo's connexion with writing and learning, will be found in my essay \"On the Religion of the Babylonians and Assyrians\" (Herodotus, vol. i. p. 639). The Babylonian Hermes was well known to the later Greeks as the reputed author of the Chaldaean oracles, and there are two Gods mentioned in the Bible under the name of Hermes. The idea of the library of the Greeks may perhaps have borrowed the title, though their function seems to have been to protect the zigguarat or 'towers of the temples,' rather than the libraries. B.M.I. vol. iii. p. 66, col. 7, l. 13.\n\n2 Justin, xviii. 3, \u00a7 2: \"Tyriorum gens condita a Phoenicibus fuit, qui terrae motu vexati, relicto patrie solo, Assyrium stagnum primum, mox mari proximum litus incolerunt, condit\u0101 ibi urbe, quam \u00e0 piscium ubertate Sidona appellaverunt.\" The abundance of fish is probably another trace of the cult of Oannes.\n\n3 I extract the following account of T\u016bb from Yaqut: \"It is a small town between W\u0101d\u012bs\u012bt and Khur\u0101n\u016br. The inhabitants are Wahh\u0101b\u012bs to the present day, and their language Nabathean. D\u0101d\u016b Ibn Ahmed Ibn Said, a merchant of T\u016bb,\"\nbe remembered, was half-fish half-man, and wherever, therefore, we find notices of the fish worship, we may perhaps recognize the influence of the passage of H\u00e9a's colony. The line of advance, indeed, would seem indicated, 1st, by H\u00e9a's mother in the Indian Ocean; 2nd, by H\u00e9a himself in the Persian Gulf, and as far north as T\u016bb; and 3rd, by his daughter having founded and named Nineveh, which is represented by the same monogram as the name of the goddess, and signifies \"the shrine of the fish.\" From Nineveh we might trace the passage of the colony\u2014along the same line, perhaps, that was subsequently followed by the Jews or Hebrews\u2014by the holy fish at Harran and Hierapolis (or Carchemish) to Syria, where, as we know, fish had every-\n\n(continued on next page)\n\n(continued from previous page)\n\nIt is impossible to overlook the fact that in both of the Biblical apologetics relating to Nineveh, the account, I mean, of the journey of Jonah, and the apocryphal story of Tobit, a fish plays the principal part, which, if it be a mere coincidence, is at least remarkable; but I must reserve any further remarks on the fish legend for another occasion.\n\nI take this opportunity of assuring my own claim to the discovery that the translation of the Bible (Georgius of the Inscriptions) was represented not by Ctesiphon, as stated by Eusebius of Caesarea, but by Hieropolis, Miletus, considerably to the north, an identification which, in the late excellent article in The Times newspaper on the history of the Hittites, was credited to Signor Maspero. I announced this discovery in 1853 (see my paper on the \"Early History of Babylonia,\" Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Vol. XV. p. 231), and pointed out that the Syrians translated Carchemish by Mabog (2 Chron. xxxv. 20), a name derived from the 'mother of the Gods,' or 'Syria Dea,' who was worshipped there. And here I may add, as a curious coincidence, that Atargatis (or \u1f08\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03ac\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2) the Syrian name for the great Goddess, signifies a gate; and that name, the name of the great Goddess of the native Iranians, who is said to have had the same appellation, as she was also called Jana (the wife of Janus). Is it then allowable to translate Ker-gamis (or Carchemish) \"the fort of the Goddess Diana or Diana (the gate)\"? The same Goddess seems to have been called Diana by the Syrians of a later age.\nwhere a sacred character, and where, at Ascalon and Ashdod in particular, the fish god was especially worshipped. This curious subject would require for its illustration far more study than I can here bestow on it, but it is well worth the attention of those who have time at their command.\n\nI now propose, before closing my notes, briefly to consider the geographical branch of the subject.\n\nThere has long been, as it is well known, great uncertainty and a great conflict of opinion with regard to the identification of the islands of the Persian Gulf in Ancient Geography; but this uncertainty has arisen mainly from an imperfect sifting of the authorities. Guided by our present improved knowledge both of the hydrography of the Gulf, and of the vernacular nomenclature of the region, I venture to think that all difficulties disappear, and that we can identify the Greek forms of the Arabian names as certainly as we can identify the isles of the Archipelago. The Greeks gained their first acquaintance with this part of Asia from Nearchus, Alexander's Admiral, the narrative of whose voyage was compiled by Arrian some centuries after the event, from the logs of the officers employed in the expedition. Strabo had also access to the same materials, either directly, or through Eratosthenes, and thus often furnishes a valuable commentary on Arrian. It is only indeed by comparing the accounts of these two authors that we get at the true reports of Alexander's officers as to the Persian and Arabian coasts. Nearchus's fleet, after leaving Armoezia (Bender Abbass or old Hormuz), coasted along the island of Kishm, to which Arrian, Strabo, Ptolemy, and Pliny all give the name of Oaraeata or Voroctha (modern Vroet), and anchored at two points upon the coast, the Persian governor of the district, named Mazenes, coming on board at the first or most easternly station, and taking charge of the pilotage of the expedition from that point as far on as the Pasitigris. The Greeks did not venture into the interior of Voroctha, and what they learnt, therefore, of the geography of the island and its neighbourhood must have come from Mazenes and his companion Mithropastes, Satrap\nof Phrygia, who had been exiled to the Persian Gulf by Darius. When Arrian accordingly mentions that the famous tomb of King Erythras, from whom the Erythrean Sea was named, was to be seen in the island of Voroctha, he is evidently mis-quoting Nearchus and Orthagoras; for their statement, preserved by Strabo, was to the effect that Mithropastes had been banished to the island of Tuplum, where was to be seen the tomb of King Erythras, \"on a high mound covered with wild palms\"; and they added that Mithropastes, having fled from Ogrys (which is thus shown to be in the same neighbourhood as Tyrine), came to Mazenes at Voroctha, and there sought refuge with the Greeks. Now Tuplum may be merely the Persian pronunciation of Tvlvm (the Greek informants being Persians), which again may be the same as Tvlv, the Assyrian name for Nidukki, or the larger island of Bahrein; or Tyrine may be an independent name afterwards hardened to Dirin. Androsthenes, Alexander's surveying officer, who followed down the Arabian coast from Teredon, at the mouth of the Euphrates, 2400 stadia to Gerrha, and then crossed over to Bahrein, names the two islands Tupos and Apados, observing, no doubt, the pronunciation of his Persian pilot; but Ptolemy, who followed the Roman traders, gives the more correct reading of Tilos and Apados. The name of Tul or Til is now unknown, but it seems to have lasted down almost to the Arab conquest, the Christian Bishop of Talon, or Tilun, being mentioned, in a Syrian letter dated early in the seventh century, among the ecclesiastics of the province of Catara, subordinate to the Metropolitan of Persis.1 Arad, on the other hand, is still\n\n1 There were five Bishops of the Nestorian Church at this period in the province of Catara (mod. J5), holding the sees of Dirin, Musamij, Telon, Khata, and Hujai. Asemani identifies Talon with Tilos, Bahrein, without any hesitation, but I am following the Syrian authorities when I quote. I doubt his correctness. I observe that the insular see is always named Dirin, which approaches nearer to the Tuplum of Strabo than does Talon. Dirin also heads the list, and it was from hence that George the Monk took rich altar cloths back to Assyria, probably imported from India; these several indications pointing to the island of Bahrein rather than to any town in the interior. There may, perhaps, have been two distinct names, Tila (as in Tilum, Tilos, etc.) applying to the island, and Tyrine, or Dirin, applying to the chief town of the island; whilst Talon more probably represented Thelum or Dhielum, the port at the entrance of the Gerrha bay.\nknown as the name of the principal village on the lesser island of Maharak. In the Arab geographies the name is written \\( \\text{Al-Arrat} \\), as if the terminal letter were the mere feminine ending, which would broadly distinguish it from the Mediterranean \\( \\text{Arvad} \\), where the final letter is a radical. But although it is thus quite certain that \\( \\text{Tul} \\) and \\( \\text{Arath} \\) have no connexion with Tsur and Arvad, I see no reason for doubting the testimony of Androstenes, that the temples on the island were similar to those of the Phoenicians\u2014a fact of which he, an inhabitant of Thasos, which was a Graeco-Phoenician colony, must have been a fully competent judge,\u2014nor that the inhabitants preserved a tradition up to that time of their ancestors in remote antiquity having sent forth a colony to the Mediterranean. In the old Arab geographers, Istakhri, Ibn-Howkal, and their followers, three islands only are mentioned in the Persian Gulf, \\( \\text{Khurak}, \\text{Lafti}, \\text{and Aqil} \\), or the modern Karrak, Kishm, and Bahrein; but the name under which the district of Bahrein, both insular and littoral, was more generally known in later times was \\( \\text{Hajor} \\), a name that seems at one time to have applied to the capital of the larger island, probably marked by the present ruins of \\( \\text{Bildid-Kadam} \\).\n\nThe inscription on Capt. Durand's black stone found on the island of Bahrein authorizes us to believe that the tribe which was anciently dominant in the island and surrounding district was named \\( \\text{Agiru} \\). Here then we have the original of the Greek \\( \\text{Ogyris} \\), and the modern \\( \\text{Uqeir} \\), or vulgarly \\( \\text{Oqair} \\). Ogyris was the district to which Mithropastes had been banished by Darius, but Tyrine was the particular island residence from whence the chief escaped to join the Greeks at Oaracta.\\(^1\\) The position of Ogyris or Tyrine, opposite\n\n\\(^1\\) For the authorities regarding the position of Tyrine and Ogyris, see Strabo, p. 766, and Cellarius, p. 700. Ya\u00eb\u00fbt says of \\( \\text{Uqeir} \\) that \"it is a village on the sea-shore opposite to \\( \\text{Hajor} \\);\"\\(^2\\) and of \\( \\text{Qatar} \\), \"In the district of Bahrein, on the coast of \\( \\text{Khatt}, \\text{Laz} \\), between \\( \\text{Om\u00e1n} \\) and \\( \\text{Uqeir} \\), is a village named \\( \\text{Qatar} \\), from whence came the red-striped cloths, called \\( \\text{Qatariyeh} \\).\"\nto Gerrha, is fixed with sufficient accuracy by the Greeks, Androsthenes giving the distance of 2400 stadia from Teredon, or perhaps from Icarus, while Orthagoras gives a cross measurement of 2000 stadia from the coast of Carmania. It is impossible to say whether Quintus Curtius refers to Ogyris or Oaracta, when, on the authority of Alexander's officers, he placed the tomb of Erythras in an island at a short distance from the continent; but Agatharcides would seem at any rate to allude to the latter, that is, to Kishm, which is only separated by a narrow creek from the mainland, when he repeats the fable of a certain Persian named Erythras having followed his horses, which had swum across an arm of the sea to escape from a lioness, and having thus discovered the island. Pliny, followed by Pomponius Mela and Dionysius, seems to have had independent authority for assigning the tomb of Erythras to Ogyris, and if \"Ovropos,\" which occurs in the Palatine copy of Ptolemy, be a genuine reading, that geographer must also have consulted charts very different from those constructed by Androsthenes and Orthagoras. Ptolemy, however, makes no allusion to King Erythras or his tomb. The Arab geographers often mention the village of 'Uqair in their notices of the Bahrein coast, but it does not seem to have been a place of much consequence at the time of the Arab conquest, as it is not found in the records of that period, nor, indeed, has the modern name ever regained its old celebrity. Bahrein and the adjoining territory in the time of the Prophet were under the administration of a Persian Marzab\u00e1n or \"Lord of the marches,\" and the inhabitants, principally composed of Arabs of the tribes of Abdul-Keis, Bekir, and Tam\u00edn, included also a large number of Magians, Jews, and Christians. A series of expeditions were therefore undertaken during the reigns of the first four Caliphs with a view to the conversion of the inhabitants to Isl\u00e1m or their subjection to the Jezi\u00e9h or Poll-tax.\u00b9 The names of a number of cities are thus found in the early Arabic annals, which became classical terms to\n\n\u00b9 Baladhuri, in his famous Fut\u00e1d, has a special chapter on the conquest of Bahrein. Edit. de Goeje, p. 79 to 86.\nfuture poets and historians, but few of which survived to later times. In the following list indeed, preserved by Yac\u00fat, it is only the first four names which were generally known to the geographers. 1. El-Khatt; 2. El-Kat\u00edf; 3. Al-Arrat; 4. Hajar; 5. Binunat; 6. Az-Zirat; 7. Jow\u00e1tha; 8. As-S\u00e1b\u00far; 9. Dar\u00edn; and 10. Al-Ghabet. 1. Khatt was the line of sea-coast opposite to Bahrein, the Arra of Ptolemy, and in all probability emigrants from hence colonized the island of Keis, which in Alexander's time was named Kardia, and was, like Bahrein, sacred to Mercury and Venus. There was a great trade between this part of the coast and India during the early ages of Isl\u00e1m, insomuch that the spears used throughout Arabia, being formed of Indian bamboos landed on these shores, were known as R\u00e1mah-el-Khattiyeh. 2. Kat\u00edf, the port of Al-Ahsa, must always have been an ancient site, but the name affords no clue to its identity. 3. Al-Arrat, as I have said before, is the modern Arad, on the island of Maharrak, and the ancient Arathus. 4. Hajar was a name used almost indifferently with Bahrein both for the district, for the larger island, and for the capital of that island, marked by the ruins of Bil\u00e1d Kadim. Of the remaining towns, S\u00e1b\u00far, or Sab\u00fan as it is often written, and Dar\u00edn\n\n---\n\n1 The capital of Hajar is further said by Yac\u00fat, quoting from some anonymous author, to be As-Saf\u00e1 and Mush\u00e1kakor, a sort of double city, which is thus described: \"El-Mush\u00e1kakor is a very strong fort of the Abi-nl-Kais in Bahrein, used by them as a place of defence. They had also another fortress called As-Saf\u00e1 in front of the city of Hajar. The Jami mosque was in Mush\u00e1kakor, and between the two forts there flowed a river which was called El-'Ain, and which went to the city of Muhammed Ibn-El-Ghimr, etc.\" I know nothing of these places, and in fact have never met with the names except in Yac\u00fat's great Dictionary. The Howkal gives the names of three places, Bahrein, Hajar, El-Kat\u00edf, El-'Uqair, Bahrein, and El-Kh\u00e1zy, while he describes Awd\u00e1 as the name of the Island, belonging to Abu-Sa'd and Suliman Ibn-El-Hassan, the famous Carmathian leaders, who levied an enormous tribute from the ships which traded there.\n\n2 Yac\u00fat, quoting from Abu-Mansur, says that the coast of 'Om\u00e1n was throughout called Al-Khatt, the chief places on the coast being El-Kat\u00edf, El-'Uqair, and Kafar, and then adds, on his own part, \"All these places belong to the sea-coast of Bahrein and 'Om\u00e1n; they used to bring here bamboo spears from India, which were afterwards exported and sold to the Arabs,\" and so on. Babylonian times they brought teak-wood from India to Mopan, and used it in building temples and palaces under the name of ..., B.M.I. vol. iii. p. 28, l. 38.\nor Dirin, are noticed in many other authorities, though their precise locality is unknown, but the rest belong, I think, exclusively to the holy war. Of other names in the vicinity, I may notice that the Zark\u00e1 \u1e0djj of Mokadassi is evidently the \u03a3\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd of Ptolemy, while Qatar, \u1e0djj (modern Gattar, south of Bahrein), represents his \u039a\u03b1\u03b4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1.1 With regard to Gerrha itself, the great mart of commerce between the East and West from the very earliest times to the second or third century of our era, there can be no doubt that it was situated at a short distance inland (Strabo, following Androsthenes, says 200 stadia) from the mouth of the creek immediately opposite to Bahrein. Capt. Durand speaks of ruins at that spot, and says that they still retain the name of Geriyeh, but I am not aware that the locality has been visited by any traveller in recent times, though it would probably well repay the trouble of examination. I have a strong suspicion myself that, as the emporium of the Indian trade in the Gulf, it represents the Ophir of the Bible, and the Apirak or Milukh of the Inscriptions, the sister port of Magan (the Mariw\u0101na of Ptolemy) being either at Dhelam, or at Ojair, or in the immediate vicinity. There is no trace of such names as Magan and Milukh now remaining, but Gerrha has probably survived in the Arabic Jer'\u00e1 \u0644\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0631\u0652, which means generally \"a sandy desert,\" but which I find in Ibn-Howkal's account of the wars of the Carmathian heretics applied to a considerable place in the vicinity of El-Ahad.2 The Gerrheans, who monopolized the carrying trade between the Persian Gulf and Syria, and who founded Gerrha for the convenience\n\n---\n\n1 Mokadassi (p. 71) says of Hajar or Bahrein, that its capital is El-Ahad, and its chief places Sabin, As-Zarki, El-'Ugeir, and Awi, while Yamaineh is a dependency. El-Ahsa (mod. Lhasa) he describes more particularly as \"the capital of Hajar, which is also called Bahrein; a large place with abundance of palms, and very populous but notorious for heat and drought; also one store from the sea, and the chief place of the Carmathians.\" Yac\u00fbt adds that El-Ahad is \"a well-known town of Bahrein. It was founded and fortified and made the capital of Hajar, by Abu-Tahir El-Hassan, son of Abu-Said, the Carmathian leader, and is still a celebrated and very populous place.\" Yac\u00fbt further says that the name of Bahrein comes from \"a certain lake (or Bokeireh) at the gate of the town of Al-Ahad, which is about three miles square, and the water of which is stagnant and salt, and of no use for cultivation. Al-Ahad is about ten farsakhs from the sea.\"\n\n2 Edit. de Goeje, p. 22.\nof their traffic, are expressly said by the Greeks to have been Arabian nomades,\\(^1\\) that is, they were Jer'\u0101i, or inhabitants of \"the sandy desert,\" just as the Bedouin or Bed\u0101wi derive their name from B\u0101diyeh, which has pretty well the same signification. It would be a subject of great ethnographical interest to show how and when the Semitic Arabs, to whom these Jer'\u0101i, or Gerrhaeans, undoubtedly belonged, superseded the early, I will not venture to say the aboriginal, Turanian population along the shores and in the islands of the Persian Gulf. The clue is to be found probably in a close comparison of the ante-Islamic traditions and idolatry of the Arabs with the mythology of the Cuneiform inscriptions; though before any definite results could be obtained, it would be necessary to resolve that mythology into its respective Turanian and Semitic elements,\u2014a labour which has not yet been attempted by even our most advanced Assyriologists, and for which, indeed, it may be doubted if sufficient materials have been as yet obtained.\n\nP.S.\u2014The Trustees of the British Museum, appreciating the value of Captain Durand's researches at Bahrein, allotted last year a sum of \u00a3100 for experimental excavations in the island, on behalf of the British Government, and would have augmented the grant if there had been any reasonable prospect of finding further specimens of Cuneiform writing; but when the instructions reached Bushire, Captain Durand had been recalled to India, and the opportunity has not since arisen of deputing another officer to the island to continue the work of opening the tombs; but the search, though suspended, has not been abandoned, and important results may yet be looked for.\n\n\\(^1\\) Nicand. Alexiph. vers. 244. The route followed by the caravans from Gerrha to Palmyra was probably the same which, in a contrary direction, Mr. Falgrave pursued from Syria by Hall, Riadh, and El-Ahs\u00e9 to Kaitj.\nART. VIII.\u2014Notes on the Locality and Population of the Tribes dwelling between the Brahmaputra and Ningthi Rivers.\n\nBy the late G. H. Damant, M.A., M.R.A.S., Political Officer, N\u00e1ga Hills.\n\nMy object in the following paper is to give a brief account of the wild tribes dwelling in the tract of country lying between the Brahmaputra and the Kaiendwen, Namtonai, or Ningthi, as it is indifferently called, the great western branch of the Irrawaddy.\n\nI shall not attempt to give any description of the manners and customs of these tribes, but shall confine myself to indicating the localities which they inhabit, their probable numbers, their principal villages, and the names by which they are known among themselves and to the people of the plains; this last is very important, as many instances have occurred where inquirers working in different parts of the same country have described what is essentially one and the same tribe under different names, and the result has been that people residing at a distance have in more than one instance supposed them to be distinct tribes.\n\nIt is important, as a preliminary to deeper inquiries, that these points should be finally settled; until that is done, we must to a great measure be working in the dark, and considerable confusion must arise.\n\nLastly, I shall attempt to classify the different dialects philologically, as far as is at present possible from our limited knowledge of the subject, noting and giving specimens of the different characters where they exist. I have also given, for the sake of reference, short vocabularies of thirty test words in most of the languages referred to; they have been\ncollected by myself, except where it is specially mentioned to the contrary.\n\nWithin the boundaries indicated above, we find members of the Tibeto-Burman, Tai, and Kh\u00e2si families, the former greatly predominating. The distribution of these numerous tribes into their various sub-families is a matter of great difficulty. Of the N\u00e2ga alone, there are not less, and probably more, than thirty different tribes, all speaking different languages, and mutually unintelligible one to another. In some instances, perhaps, a few may be reduced to the rank of dialects, but in the majority of cases they are essentially distinct languages, and often no connexion or similarity is to be found between them, as, for instance, Ang\u00e2mi and Lhota are so entirely different, that it is difficult to believe they belong to the same family, while some dialects of N\u00e2ga, such as Kabui and Maring, I unhesitatingly class with the Kuki languages.\n\nThe N\u00e2ga dialects I have classed under three heads: the western, central, and eastern sub-families. Most of the tribes attached to the western family are fairly well known, with the exception of the Luhupas and cognate tribes, amongst whom some new tribes and languages will doubtless be discovered, when their country has been explored. Of this group, the Ang\u00e2mi is the most important tribe, as they are not only the most numerous, but the most warlike and enterprising of any of the N\u00e2ga tribes.\n\nThe next family, the Central N\u00e2ga, contains only three tribes of importance: the Lhota, Sema, and Hatigorria.\n\nThe Lhota we are fairly well acquainted with, and their country has been thoroughly well explored; but of the Sema and Hatigorria our knowledge is very limited; only a part of their country has been visited by European officers, and of their language we know almost nothing. It is, however, amongst the Eastern N\u00e2ga, that the greatest confusion exists; there is such a multiplicity of tribes, each speaking a different dialect, and they are so small in numbers, sometimes consisting of only one small village, that, without visiting each village personally, it is almost impossible to\ndefine the limits of each tribe with any approach to accuracy, or even to say precisely how many tribes there are. This immense number of dialects has undoubtedly arisen from the isolation, in which each community is forced to dwell. Every tribe, almost every village, is at war with its neighbour, and no N\u00e1ga of these parts dare leave the territory of his tribe without the probability, that his life will be the penalty, while the inner tribes look down longingly on the plains of Assam, where they would fain go to trade, but are kept back by a narrow line of villages hostile to them, and which they dare not cross. When, however, these feuds and murders have been effectually stopped by the interference of the British Government, a work which is now in progress, these insignificant dialects must disappear and be replaced either by Assamese or the language of one of the stronger tribes.\n\nMy classification of the N\u00e1ga dialects must, therefore, be accepted merely as provisional; there are many tribes of which we really know nothing, and into whose country travellers cannot venture without a strong force, while there is a considerable tract of country lying north of the Sarameti range which is entirely unexplored, and there is not one dialect of which we have any grammar or sufficient vocabulary. Under such circumstances, any classification must be open to modification hereafter, and, as far as this family is concerned, considerable corrections will doubtless be required.\n\nThe classification of the Kuki family is probably more correct; their habitat is better known, except the country of the Poi and Sokte, which is still unexplored, and we have grammatical notes and vocabularies of several of the languages. It will be observed that I have included in this division the Manip\u00fari language and several dialects which are generally known as N\u00e1ga, and I think the classification will be borne out by a careful comparison of the languages.\n\nThe oldest form of any of these languages which we possess is to be found in the Manip\u00fari MSS., called the Takhelgnamba and Samjokgnamba, containing accounts of the wars between Manip\u00far and Burma and Tipperah, and the Langlol, or \"Share of Sin,\" and other religious treatises.\nIn these writings we find that the language approaches very closely to the modern Kuki, both in grammar and vocabulary. There is, however, as a rule, a marked distinction in dress and manners between the Kuki and N\u00e1ga, even in cases where their dialects closely resemble each other, and there is only one tribe with which I am acquainted, the Cheroo, dwellers in the hills of Manipur, which in any way unite the characteristic features of the two; at the same time, the very close resemblance which exists between the Kuki Proper, the Manipuri, and the Kabui, and other tribes of N\u00e1ga, clearly shows that they must be sprung from the same stock.\n\nThe Mikir is a language which is not easy to class; I doubt whether it belongs to the Tibeto-Burman family at all, and should be inclined to class it as a separate family, as it has scarcely any resemblance to any other language with which I am acquainted; for the present, however, I class it as a sub-family of the Tibeto-Burman. The Mikir resemble no other tribe in appearance or customs, and it is extremely doubtful whether they are allied to any of their neighbours.\n\nThe group classed under the Kach\u00e1ri sub-family may be accepted as correct. The tribes coming under this head are all well known, and inhabit explored country, while of most of them we have fairly full vocabularies.\n\nThe Tai family is but sparsely represented, and needs no further notice here.\n\nAbout the Kh\u00e1si family, I have no further information to give in addition to what has been printed before. I therefore omit it altogether, merely mentioning it in the list of languages.\n\nThe Kach\u00e1ri-Koch Sub-Family.\n\nThe first family we come to is the Kach\u00e1ri, or Boro, in which I include, besides the Kach\u00e1ri Proper, the Mech, Koch, G\u00e1ro, Rabha, and Chutia sub-divisions. Most authorities also include the Tipperah, but, as they are a tribe with which I have no personal acquaintance, and I can find no vocabulary on which reliance can be placed, I hesitate to\ninclude them without further inquiry. From their position, we should expect them to belong to the Kuki family, and not to the Kach\u00e1ri family, from the nearest members of which they are separated by a wide tract of country. There is, however, some connexion between them, and for the present they may be attached to the Kach\u00e1ri-Koch family; they are found in the districts of Sylhet, Hill Tipperah, and Chittagong Hill Tracts, and number about 30,000 souls. This family has been very much Hinduized, so much so, that of some of its sub-divisions, such as the Rabha and Koch, only small remnants are left who have clung to the faith of their fathers, and cultivate after their fashion. The G\u00e1ro, on the contrary, are still in their primitive state, and few, if any, traces of Hinduism are to be found among them. It is a peculiarity of nearly the whole of this family, that they are essentially dwellers in the Terai, living, as a rule, neither in the hills nor the plains, but occupying the debatable ground between the two; a tract of country, in which no race but themselves could exist and flourish, so deadly is the malaria which arises from it. All the members of this family burn their dead, and all, with the exception of the G\u00e1ro, refuse to eat beef.\n\nThe purest type of the family is probably the Hojai Kach\u00e1ri, who live in the hills of North Kachar and Nowgong, along both banks of the Diyung river. These people are only to a very slight extent Hinduized, and they have preserved the ancient customs of their race almost intact. They belong to the ancient Kach\u00e1ri kingdoms, whose greatness is attested by the ruins still to be seen at Dimapur, at Maibong, and at Khaspur, the former capitals.\n\n**Hojai, or Purbuttia Kach\u00e1ri.**\n\nThese people, who are called in their own dialect \"Dimasa\" or sons of the water, inhabit the country lying both sides of the Langting and Diyung rivers, extending as far as Mohungdijua. In the plains they extend to the district of Nowgong on the west, and on the east to Semkhor, which is\ntheir farthest village in that direction. Their country is called in old maps Tularam Senapati's country. Tularam himself, a Hojai, is the last of the Kachari race who had exercised jura regalia, except the present Raja of Kuch Behar. The number of Hojai who have fully retained their old customs I estimate at 21,000; besides these, there is a population of over 200,000 Kacharis in the Assam Valley, of whom about one-quarter have adopted the Hindu religion, the remainder preserving their old customs more or less unadulterated.\n\nThe Mech dialect is probably derived from the Hojai, which may be accepted as the standard for the Kachari language, properly so-called.\n\nClosely connected with the Hojai Kachari are the Lalong, a tribe which is found in the district of Nowgong, in the lowlands at the foot of the hills, inhabited by the Hojai. They extend in small numbers to Kamrup, their total population numbers about 35,000 souls. They are partially Hinduized, but retain many of their ancient customs. They have a language of their own, but I have not succeeded in obtaining a specimen of it. Most of them can understand Assamese.\n\nMech.\n\nThis tribe is found in the sal forests in Goalpara, lying along the foot of the Garo Hills, in the Bhutan Duars and the Darjeeling Terai. In their own dialect they call themselves Boro, and by the Hojai Kachari they are called Rangsa, or Ramsa. They number about 31,000 souls, nearly all in the Goalpara district; they never settle in the hills, but confine themselves to the forests at the foot. A few only use the plough, and a great proportion of them work as wood-cutters.\n\nIt will be noticed as a peculiarity in their dialect, that it contains no higher numeral than six.\n\nRabha.\n\nThe Rabha are found in the districts of Goalpara, Kam-\nrup, and Darrang; they number about 60,000 souls. They are divided into four sub-divisions, called Pati, Rangdoniya, Matrai, and Songga. Of these, the Pati Rabha have become to a great extent Hinduized, and have abandoned their own language for Assamee; the remainder still preserve their own customs and language to a greater or less extent. The Matrai Rabha are probably the purest specimens of the race; they bear a close resemblance both to the Garo and the Bania Koch both in their dialect and their manners and customs. They are a scattered and broken race, having few, if any, villages of their own, but living in small hamlets along with the Mech and Koch.\n\nGaro.\n\nThe Garo, Mande as they are called in their own tongue, are the most primitive of all the Kachari family; they cling fondly to their old customs, and have been very little, if at all, infected by Hinduism. The total number of Garo may be estimated at about 107,000, of whom about 80,000 dwell in the Garo Hills, and the remainder in the districts of Goalpara, Kamrup, and Mymensingh. The language is a strong one, and not in the least likely to disappear in favour of Assamese or Bengali, as will doubtless be the fate before long of the other languages belonging to this family.\n\nThe Garo who inhabit the tract of country known as the Garo Hills are divided into three tribes: the Atong, inhabiting the south-east, the Abengya the south-west, and the remainder are called Achik. The language of all three is essentially the same, but there are slight differences in dialect. The language of the Achik may be looked upon as the standard.\n\nThe Garo differ from the other members of the family inasmuch as they will eat beef, but, like the rest, they burn their dead. The Garo preserved their independence in a great measure up to 1872, when they were finally subdued, and they are now fairly quiet.\nKoch.\n\nThe next member of the family, and the only one which has preserved its independence, is the Koch race. This tribe was formerly most numerous and powerful, and even now we can recognize over a million and a half of people who are descended from it. In describing them, a broad distinction must be drawn between the Koch, who have adopted Hindu customs, and the Bengali or Assamese language, and those who have retained their own customs and language intact. Of the latter, a mere remnant, numbering approximately about 10,000 souls, is still to be found in the valleys along the skirts of the G\u00e1ro Hills. They are divided into two principal tribes, known as the Bania or Pani Koch and the Tintikya Koch; the first mentioned is considered superior, but neither of them recognize caste in any way. There are also minor sub-divisions known as Dasgaoniya and Harigao-niya. The specimen of words given was taken from a Dasgaoniya Koch. Hinduized members of this tribe are found in every district of Assam, in Kuch Behar, Dinage-pore, Purneah, Rangpur, Jalpaiguri, Bogra, and Mymensingh; they are known as Koch, Rajbanshi, Pali, and Hajong. The Hinduized Koch, so many as have retained their ancient name, are not fully Hinduized, that is to say, they eat pig and drink spirits, and do not pretend to be much bound by caste prejudices. Next come the Pali, part of whom, the Desi Pali, will eat almost any kind of food except beef; while the remainder, known as Sadhu Pali, are strict Hindus, and resemble the Rajbanshi, who have fully adopted Hindu customs. The Rajbanshi, however, are largely recruited from other tribes. Conversions occur every day, and any Mech, Koch, Kach\u00e1ri, or Rabha can become a Rajbanshi on payment of a small sum to the priest, and promising to conform to the rules of the caste.\n\nThe Hajong have been classed as Kach\u00e1ri by some writers, but I see no reason for this, and prefer to class them with the Koch, to whom they seem closely allied; they are only found in the districts of Go\u00e1lp\u00e1ra and Mymensingh.\nThey number about 30,000 souls; in addition to them the Koch number 405,000, the Pali 378,000, and the Rajbanshi 778,000, making the total numbers of this tribe 1,591,000 souls. The Raja of Kuch Behar and the zemindars of Jalpaiguri and of Panga, in Rangpur, are Koch by race.\n\nChutia.\n\nThis tribe has been attached to the Kach\u00e1ri family by most authorities, and I therefore give it a place here. But there is no doubt that the Chutia came into the Assam Valley from the north-east, and the Kach\u00e1ri from the south, while of the language we hardly know enough to form an opinion. It is not improbable that they will eventually be found to be closely allied to the Miri: indeed, there is a tribe of Miri living near the Subansiri river, who call themselves Chutia Miri, and claim to be descended from the Chutia kings, in proof of which they wear their hair long, contrary to the usual custom of their tribe; this they say was the privilege of the royal family. The Chutia are found throughout Upper Assam, where they number about 50,000. They have abandoned their own language and customs, and become Hinduized. A small colony, however, in the Lakhimpur district, called Deori Chutia, have preserved the old language to a certain extent, but whether it is used in conversation, or only as a sacred language, is doubtful; it is also uncertain whether this is the true language of the tribe. This colony is said to be the descendants of the priests of the copper temple near Sadiya known as Tamasuri Mai, at which human sacrifices were offered.\n\nThe Mikir Sub-Family.\n\nThe Mikir, or Arleng as they call themselves, are found in the districts of Nowgong, North Kach\u00e1r, Jainti\u00e1, N\u00e1ga Hills, and K\u00e1mr\u00fap; they number in all about 62,000 souls, of which more than half inhabit the tract of country known as the Mikir Hills, in the district of Nowgong. The lan-\nguage of this tribe, as well as their manners and customs, are so different from those of their neighbours, that it is not easy to class them with any other tribe. They inhabit the low hills adjoining the plains, and live entirely by jh\u00fam cultivation. They are pagan, but refuse to eat beef and bury their dead. They have no knowledge of writing in any form. They are a very unwarlike inoffensive race, and in former years suffered severely from the incursions of their turbulent neighbours, the Ang\u00e1mi.\n\nThe Kuki Sub-Family.\n\nThe tribes, which I include under this head, are found throughout the hill tracts extending from the plains of Assam on the north, to Burma on the south, and from the Kh\u00e1i Hills on the west, to the country of the Luhupa and Ang\u00e1mi N\u00e1ga on the east. They are almost entirely independent, and, with the exception of the Manip\u00fari, are in a state of barbarism. Amongst them are some of the fiercest and most warlike tribes with which we come in contact on the north-east frontier, such as the Shindu, Sokte, and Lushai, tribes which are well armed with muskets obtained from Burma, and who know how to use them. Of the arts of reading and writing they are entirely ignorant, except, indeed, the Manip\u00fari, who have a character of their own, derived from the N\u00e1gari, of which a specimen is given. They are a migratory race, living by jh\u00fam cultivation, and preferring the densest forests. War and the chase they look upon as the noblest pursuits of man. They bury their dead, and are pagan, except the Manip\u00fari, who are Hinduized. They are closely allied to the Khyeng of Burma.\n\nThe Old Kuki.\n\nThe old Kuki are found in North Kach\u00e1r and in Manip\u00far; in the former district there are four tribes, all closely resembling one another, called Bete, Khelma, Rangkhol, and Ranglong. They inhabit about twenty-five villages, with a\npopulation of about five thousand. These tribes are now peaceful, and pay a house-tax to the British Government. Contrary to the custom of the majority of the family, they burn their dead. The principal tribes found in Manipur are Kom, Koireng, Cheru, Chohte, Pooroom, Muntuk, Karum, and Aimole; of these, the Kom are the most numerous, and, indeed, were until lately a rather powerful tribe, their principal village containing some six hundred houses. They have for a long time been at war with the new Kuki, at whose hands they have suffered great loss from time to time. No accurate estimate of their population can be given, but they probably do not exceed six or seven thousand. The Koireng are a small and insignificant tribe, dwelling in eight small villages situate on the hills north of the Valley of Manipur. They inhabit 120 houses and number about 600.\n\nThe Cheru live in the same part of the country as the Koireng, inhabiting adjacent villages; their villages are thirteen in number, with 260 houses and a population of about 1,300. In appearance and dress they somewhat resemble the Kabui Naga, but their language and customs show them to be closely allied to the Kuki; they serve to connect the two.\n\nOf the Chohte, Pooroom, Muntuk, and Aimole tribes, there are mere remnants only existing, and their aggregate population would probably not exceed fifteen hundred; they are found in the hills in and around the valley of Manipur.\n\nTHE NEW KUKI.\n\nThe new Kuki are found in the districts of Kachar, Naga Hills, and Manipur. It is difficult to say with accuracy what their population is, but it may be put down at about ten thousand or a little more. They are divided into four principal clans: Thado, Shingsol, Changsen, and Khlangam, and these again are sub-divided into numerous minor septs or families. The Thado and Shingsol are descended from the same stock, while the Changsen and Khlangam are of a different race. All alike speak the same language, which\nthey call the \"Thadopao,\" the differences in dialect are very slight. The chief of the Thado is Khutingmang, who traces his descent back some thirty generations to Thado, the progenitor of the tribe. In all questions of genealogy, the Kuki are very particular, and the hereditary succession of their chiefs is strictly preserved. They have preserved their old dialects in the songs called Hlapi, to which they dance; they originally inhabited the tract of country south of Kach\u00e1r, but have been driven north by their inveterate foes, the Lushai, Sokte, and Poi.\n\nThe Sokte, Lumyang, and Anal Namfau Kuki.\n\nThese tribes are probably closely allied to one another; but of the two first mentioned we know very little indeed, and of their language we have no vocabularies at all. They all inhabit the unexplored tract of hill country lying immediately south of Manipur and east of the Lushai country. The nearest tribe to Manipur is the Anal Namfau, so called from the names of their two principal villages; they are partially civilized, but pagan, and number only a few hundred. South of them again are the Lumyang Kuki, a powerful and warlike tribe, who are gradually being driven northwards by the constant attacks of their deadly enemies, the Sokte. This tribe claims to be the eldest branch of the whole Kuki family. Of the number of their villages and population we have no accurate information. South of them again are the Sokte, the most powerful of all the Kuki race. They all acknowledge one chief, Yatol, and I was informed by one of their slaves who escaped to Manipur that they can bring 8,000 fighting men into the field, which would imply a population of not less than 50,000. They are constantly at war with the Poi and Lushai, and are feared by all their neighbours. They keep up a communication with the plains of Burma, whence they obtain a plentiful supply of arms and ammunition.\nTHE LUSHAI, OR DZO.\n\nThe Lushai, or \"head-takers\" (lu, a head, and sha, to cut), inhabit the whole tract of country bounded by Kach\u00e1r on the north, Hill Tipperah on the west, the Chittagong Hill Tracts on the south, and the country of the Sokte and Poi on the east. They are divided into a number of subdivisions, each under a hereditary chief, the principal of whom are Sukpilak, Lalbora, and Lalhi. Their dialects vary only slightly, and are mutually intelligible, so that for practical purposes they may be considered as one tribe. Of their population, it is difficult to give any exact estimate, but they may be put down roughly at between 60,000 and 80,000. Their own name for the whole family is Dzo, Lushai being only the name of a particular clan.\n\nTHE SPINDU OR POI.\n\nOf this tribe we know very little indeed. They inhabit the country lying south-east of the Lushai, but we are ignorant how far they extend; they are, however, known to be a numerous and powerful tribe, and are gradually driving the Lushai farther to the north. They are distinguished from their neighbours by their fashion of dressing their hair, which they bind in a knot over the forehead, like a horn. The Kumi and Bunjogi of the Chittagong Hill Tracts are closely allied to them, if not actually of the same tribe.\n\nTHE MANIPURI.\n\nThis tribe is found in the independent State of Manipur and the districts of Kach\u00e1r and Sylhet; the total population is probably about 70,000, of which about forty thousand are to be found in Manipur Proper. They are the most civilized of all the tribes in that part of the country, and have succeeded in subjugating a considerable tract of country inhabited by hill tribes. They use the plough in their cultivation, which is permanent, and fairly skilled artizans are to be found among them. They profess to be strict\nHindus, but at the same time worship many deities and perform many ceremonies which are purely pagan, and snake-worship in a prominent form exists among them. They of course claim to be descendants of Arjun and Chitrangada, the daughter of the Raja of Manipur, as the story is told in the Mahabharat; but, in truth, there is no trace of Aryan blood to be found in them. They are probably descendants of old tribes called Koomal, Luang, Moirang, and Maithai, which are known to have inhabited the valley of Manipur at no very distant period. The Manipuri still call themselves Maithai, which tribe appears to have absorbed the rest; they have, however, since their conversion to Hinduism, which took place, as we know from their own records, about 1720 A.D., been largely recruited by converts from the neighbouring Naga and Kuki tribes, any of whom is eligible to put on the sacred thread, and assume with it the rank of a Khetriya, to which caste the Manipuri have attached themselves. Everything goes to show that they are very closely allied both to the Kuki and the Kabui Naga, and I have no hesitation in classifying them accordingly. Their language too, both in grammar and vocabulary, assimilates to the dialects of these tribes. The Manipuri are divided into four families, called Kumal, Luang, Mythauja, and Angong, and persons of the same clan do not marry; the same distinction exists among the Kabui and Maring Naga.\n\nThe Looe.\n\nThis term, which means \"slave or dependent,\" is applied by the Manipuri to three small tribes which inhabit the valley of Manipur; they are called Sengmai, Undro, and Chairel; all of them speak different dialects, but with a considerable mixture of Manipuri words. Their religion is pagan, tinged by Hinduism. In dress and appearance they are hardly to be distinguished from Manipuri. The Sengmai have three villages, with 120 houses and a population of about 600; the Undro one village only, with 45 houses and a population of about 225. Of the Chairel, I\nhave no exact statistics, but they have only two or three small villages. They are employed in making pottery and salt, and in distilling, occupations which the Manipuri despise.\n\n**The Kabui Naga.**\n\nThe Kabui are divided into two classes: the Songbu and Poeron; the former inhabit the range of hills which separate Kachar from Manipur, a tract of country about sixty miles from east to west, and thirty from north to south; their villages are found on both sides of the road, but there are now few to the south of it, as they have lately been driven northwards by the constant attacks of the Lushai. A few villages are also to be found in the valley of Manipur and plains of Kachar; their principal villages are Nongba, Kalanaga, Lilanang, and Lualang Khulel.\n\nThe Poeron are not a numerous tribe, and inhabit a few villages to the north-east of the Songbu. The population of the two clans is probably about six or seven thousand.\n\n**The Maring Naga.**\n\nThis tribe, which is generally called Naga, inhabit a few small villages on the Heerok range of hills, which separates Manipur from Burma. They have 300 houses and a population of about 1,500. They are divided into two branches, known as Saibu and Maring. They are said to have been formerly much more numerous than at present. They have hereditary chiefs, and tie their hair in the same way as the Spindu.\n\n**The Western Naga Sub-Family.**\n\nIn this family, excluding those of the Kuki family, which are found in the same area, I class all the Naga tribes which dwell in the great tract of hill country which lies between Kachar on the west, and the country of the Sema and naked Naga on the east, and the valley of Assam and Manipur on\nthe north and south. Among the tribes included in this tract, the Arung, Kutcha, and Quoireng N\u00e1ga are very closely allied both in customs and language; in fact, I doubt whether their dialects will be found eventually to differ to such an extent, as to entitle them to rank as separate languages. From their appearance, manners, and customs, the Rengma would at first sight appear to be more closely allied to the Lhota and Sema than the tribes with which they had been classed; but their language shows that there is a close affinity; they are the connecting link between the Western and Central N\u00e1ga. About the classification of the Ang\u00e1mi, there is doubtless considerable difficulty; in manners and customs they do not differ materially from other members of this family, but in their language there is so great a divergence that it is doubtful, whether they should not be classed as a distinct family of themselves. For the present, however, until our knowledge of their and the neighbouring languages has extended sufficiently to admit of a proper analysis being made, it is thought better to group them with the tribes to which they appear most nearly allied both by locality and custom.\n\nThe Arung, Kutcha, and Quoireng, or Liyang, N\u00e1ga.\n\nThese tribes are very closely allied to each other, both in language and customs; in appearance they can hardly be distinguished. All three tribes call themselves Jemi, or Yemi. There can be no doubt that they are all three members of one and the same stock, the differences in dialect which exist being only such as might be expected to arise among a people like this. They are not very warlike, and, although often fighting among themselves, they are almost entirely subject to the Ang\u00e1mi, to whom they pay tribute or black-mail. A single Ang\u00e1mi will go into their villages and help himself to whatever he pleases.\n\nThe Arung N\u00e1ga, Sengima, as they are called by the Ang\u00e1mi, inhabit the eastern part of North Kach\u00e1r, where they extend over a tract of country about forty miles from\nnorth to south, and twenty from east to west. They have 56 villages and 1,156 houses, with a population of about 6,000. Their principal villages are Hangrum, Nenglo, and Assaloo. This tribe have, under British influence, given up their raiding propensities, and murders are rare among them; they, however, preserve their manners and customs in their integrity. They pay a house-tax to Government.\n\nThe Kutcha N\u00e1ga are found in the south-west of the N\u00e1ga Hills district, extending from the country of the Ang\u00e1mi on the east to the boundary of Kach\u00e1r on the west. Their villages are situate on the slopes of the Burail range of mountains, and are twenty-three in number, with a population of about 6,500. Their largest villages are Kenoma and Berrima. The Quoireng or Liyang tribe inhabit the country north of Manip\u00far, lying between the Kutcha and Kabui N\u00e1ga. I have no accurate information as to their population, but it may probably be about five or six thousand.\n\n**The Mao, Maram, and Miyangkhang N\u00e1ga.**\n\nThese tribes are very similar in dress and customs, and inhabit the same tract of country; they have therefore been classed together, although it is true the dialects they speak differ considerably. They inhabit the country lying south of the Ang\u00e1mi, and between that tribe and the valley of Manip\u00far. The Mao tribe have six large villages, the principal of which is called Sopvomah; their houses number about 2,000, and the population probably reaches 10,000. They are a fierce and warlike people, hardly, if at all, inferior to the Ang\u00e1mi in this respect. South of them again are the Maram, who have only one large village, of perhaps 500 houses, with a population of some 2,500. The Miyangkhang tribe lie again south of these, and inhabit nine small villages; they may number about 5,000, or rather more.\n\n**The Rengma N\u00e1ga.**\n\nThe original site of the Rengma or Injang tribe, as they\nare called in their own tongue, is a tract of country lying between the Rengmapani and the Doyang rivers, where seven villages inhabited by this tribe are still to be found; they are surrounded by the Angami, Sema, and Lhota tribes, with whom they are constantly at war. The estimated population of these villages is about 12,500. The largest villages are Themokedima and Tesephima, both of which contain more than 500 houses. Some years ago a number of them were driven out by the constant attacks of the neighbouring tribes, and settled on a range of hills lying between the Mikir Hills in the Nowgong district and the forests of the Dhansiri. They now inhabit thirty small villages or hamlets, and their population numbers about 2,000; this portion of the tribe is fast losing its savage customs, and taking to the habits of the people of the plains to some extent, while the others still retain their primitive simplicity.\n\nThe Angami Naga.\n\nThis tribe, the most warlike, and probably the most numerous, of all the Naga tribes with which we are acquainted, occupies the centre of the great range of hills which divides Assam from Manipur. Their country is about 50 miles long from north to south, and about 80 or 100 from east to west. They are bounded on the west by the Kutcha Naga, on the north by the great uninhabited forest which covers the valleys of the Dhansiri and Doyang rivers, and by the Rengma and Lhota Naga, on the east by the Sema and naked Naga, and on the south by the Mao, Tankhol, and Luhupa Naga. They are generally separated into two divisions, known as Eastern and Western Angami, the boundary between the two being the Sijju river; they are essentially the same tribe, but there are slight differences in dialect and dress. The Western Angami hold forty-six villages, containing about 6,400 houses, with a population of about 32,000. Their principal villages are Jotsoma, Kohima, Khonoma, and Mezoma. Of the Eastern Naga we have no accurate statistics, but they have probably not less than\n80 villages, with a population of about 70,000. Among themselves, the people who inhabit the central part of their country are known as \"Tengima,\" the remainder being called \"Chakroma.\" They are a fine set of men, very warlike and enterprising, taking freely to trade, and possessing in themselves the material for forming a fine nation; but they are bloodthirsty to a degree, village fighting against village, and clan against clan, and in their fiercer quarrels sparing neither age nor sex.\n\nThe Luhupa.\n\nThis very important and large tribe is found to the north-east of Manipur. Their country is unexplored, and it is quite uncertain how far they extend to the east. Native report says eight days' journey. They are distinguished from the other tribes by the helmet of cane which they wear in battle, with a brass cymbal in front, whence their name is derived (Manipuri luhup, helmet), as well as by their custom of wearing a ring of ivory or ebony over the foreskin, and by their curious way of wearing the hair, which is cut into the shape of a cock'scomb, the sides of the head being shaved.\n\nThe Tangkhol, Phudang, and Khongoe are merely subdivisions of this tribe. Of the Luhupa and Tangkhol, I have no accurate statistics, but they must number at least 30,000 souls.\n\nThe Phudang have only one village of 100 houses, with a population of about 500; and the Khongoe one village of 60 houses, with a population of 300.\n\nThe number of dialects among the Luhupa and Tangkhol is said to be very great, almost every village in the interior speaking a distinct dialect.\n\nThe Central N\u00e1ga Family.\n\nIn this family only three tribes are included,\u2014the Lhota, Sema, and Hatigorria N\u00e1ga, but they are all large and powerful.\n\nThis classification is merely tentative, and it is possible\nthat hereafter one or more of these tribes may be found to be closely connected with some of the Eastern N\u00e1ga. The language of the Lhota differs very materially from that of its neighbours, but in dress and customs they resemble each other closely. I find in Campbell's specimens of the languages of India a vocabulary of Hatigorria, but I cannot identify it with that of any of the tribes on the Eastern Frontier. In the same work there is a vocabulary of Miklai, which is intended for Lhota, but is full of errors. In Dalton's \"Ethnology of Bengal\" is a vocabulary of so-called Khari which I cannot identify. There is a village of this name, but it is inhabited by people of the Hatigorria tribe.\n\n**The Lhota N\u00e1ga.**\n\nThis tribe, which is also called \"Miklai\" by the Assamese and \"Tiontz\" in their own language, occupy the tract of country lying south of the Sema and Rengma, and north of the Jorh\u00e1t sub-division of Sibs\u00e1g\u00e1r. On the west they are bounded by the Ang\u00e1mi, and on the east by the Hatigorria. They have about 40 or 50 villages, the chief of which are Wokha, Sanigson, and Yekom. Their population may be estimated at from 40,000 to 50,000. This tribe, as well as others of this family, is very low in the scale of civilization. They are dirty, badly clothed, small men, a great contrast to the clean, decently-clad Ang\u00e1mi. They are bloodthirsty in the extreme, and constantly at war amongst themselves and with their neighbours; every village contains a sacred tree, to which are nailed the skulls of their victims.\n\n**The Sema N\u00e1ga.**\n\nImmediately south of the Lhota, along both banks of the Doyang river, are the Sema, a very extensive tribe. On the south and west they are bounded by the Rengma and Ang\u00e1mi, but it is impossible to say, how far they extend to the east, as the country in that direction is entirely unexplored. In their manners and customs they closely\nresemble the Lhota, and they are equally dirty and blood-thirsty. They are a numerous tribe, but it is impossible to give anything like an accurate estimate of their population; it may, however, be safely asserted that they are at least 50,000 in number. Their principal villages are Lozma, Teruphima, and Ungoma. In dress they resemble the Lhota, but their men wear tails about eighteen inches long, made of wood, to which bunches of goats' hair are attached. The existence of this tribe was only discovered about six years ago, and it is, so far as I know, not mentioned in any work concerning these tribes.\n\nThe Hatigorria.\n\nThis large and warlike tribe is found to the east of the Lhota and Sema, but how far they extend it is impossible to say. In their own language they are called Samaina or Nissomeh. Of the number of their villages and population it is difficult to give anything like an exact estimate, but their numbers in all probability do not fall far short of 100,000.\n\nThe tribes known as Assiringia, Dupdoria, Dekha Haimong, and Khari, are really part of the Hatigorria tribe, and included with them; Dekha Haimong and Khari being merely the names of villages.\n\nMiscellaneous Tribes.\n\nUnder this family it is probable, that some other tribes will be classed hereafter; but as their existence was only discovered in 1874, we have no knowledge of their language, and therefore are in the dark about them at present. The first tribe consists of the inhabitants of two villages lying north-east of Manipur, called Mellomi and Sohemi; the men of this tribe go entirely naked. Other villages may hereafter be found further east. In the neighbourhood of this tribe is another, which inhabits Primi and three adjacent villages; we know nothing of them, but they are said to dress like the Lhota. The last tribe is the Mezami, who inhabit ten\nvillages near Primi; they are all under one chief, and in appearance resemble the Rengma and Sema.\n\nThe Eastern N\u00e1ga Sub-Family.\n\nIn this family are included all the tribes found in the tract lying east of the Hatigorria country extending to the Singpho country on the east and bounded on the south by the Patkoi range of hills. Within these limits there are many different tribes, some of them consisting only of a few villages, and all, or nearly all, speaking languages unintelligible the one to the other. Within twenty miles of country five or six different dialects are often to be found. We do not yet possess vocabularies of many of the languages spoken in this area, but, so far as our knowledge extends at present, a considerable affinity appears to exist among them. There is also a great resemblance in the manners and customs of the N\u00e1ga of this tract; they nearly all expose their dead upon bamboo platforms, leaving the body to rot there, the skull being preserved in the bone-house, which is to be found in nearly every village. Most of the tribes tattoo; the tattoo, ak, as it is called, not being given except to men who have killed an enemy. In several of the tribes the women are perfectly naked, in others the men.\n\nProceeding in an easterly direction from the Hatigorria country, the first tribe we meet are the Tablung N\u00e1ga, so called from their principal village; they are a tribe of naked N\u00e1ga inhabiting about thirty villages, with a population of about 25,000. Very little is known of these people.\n\nNext to them come a tribe called Sangloi, the name of their principal village; nothing is known of them, but they are believed to be as numerous as the Tablung N\u00e1ga.\n\nThe next tribe to the east are the Banfera, Joboks, or Abhaypurya tribe; they have about twelve villages, with a population of some 20,000. Joboka and Banfera are names of two of their principal villages. Abhaypurya is a name given them by the people of the plains.\n\nThe Mutonia, so called from Muton, their largest village,\nare a small tribe with only four villages, and a population of about 4,000.\n\nThe Mohongia, who are also called Borduaria and Paniduaria, have a population of about 10,000. I have no information as to the exact number of their villages, but it may be eight or ten.\n\nThe Namsangia, or Jaipuria, as they are also called, have probably about thirty villages, with a population of 25,000 or 30,000. They are the last N\u00e1ga tribe of importance to the east, though there are a few broken tribes still further to the east of them; these are of little note, and are in subjection to the Singpho.\n\n**The Tai Family.**\n\nThis family is but sparsely represented in the tract of country under discussion, and the only living members of it are the Khampti, Aiton or Shan, and Man, and of these there are very few. These people keep up their own customs and religion, and are visited from time to time by Buddhist priests from Burma. The Ahom also, who are now extinct as a race, belonged to this family, as their language shows. They and the Khampti have each a character of their own.\n\n**Khampti.**\n\nThis tribe is found between Dibrugarh and Sadiya, in the Lakhimpur district; they immigrated about a hundred years ago from the Bor Khampti country lying north of Burma on the sources of the Irrawaddy. They number probably less than 2,000 souls.\n\nClosely connected with them are the Phakial, a small tribe settled on the Dehing river near Jaipur; they seem to have acted as envoys between the Ahom of Assam and the Shan of Burma.\n\n**Aiton Shans.**\n\nThese people are found in the districts of Lakhimpur\nSibs\u00e1gar, and the N\u00e1ga hills in small detached villages, generally situated in forest. Their numbers are probably not more than 3,000; they are Buddhists, and have preserved their own language and customs. Intimately related to them are the Man, a small tribe, numbering, perhaps, 2,000, who are found in eight or ten small villages at the foot of the G\u00e1ro Hills. They have forgotten their own language, but have preserved their religion. They are said to be descendants of Shan soldiers who accompanied the Burmese when they invaded Assam in 1825; they are great hunters of elephants and rhinoceros, and used formerly to live in a great measure by their skill in the chase; they were also employed to check the incursions of the G\u00e1ro.\n\nAHOM.\n\nThe Ahom are now extinct as a race, having abandoned their language, religion, and customs, and become merged in the Assamese Hindu. I only introduce their name here to complete the list of the Tai family, found within the tract I am describing.\n### TIBETO-BURMAN FAMILY\n\n#### THE KACH\u00c1RI-KOCH SUB-FAMILY\n\n| Hojai or Hill Kach\u00e1ri. | Mech. | Kooh. | Rabha. | G\u00e1ro. | Chutia. | Tipperah. |\n|------------------------|-------|-------|--------|-------|---------|-----------|\n| Lalong.                |       | Bania or Pani. | Pati. | Abengya. |         |           |\n|                        |       | Tintikiya. | Matrai. | Atong. |         |           |\n|                        |       | Daagaoiya. | Rangdonya. | Achik. |         |           |\n|                        |       | Harigaoiya. | Songga. |       |         |           |\n|                        |       | Pali.     |        |       |         |           |\n|                        |       | Rajbanshi. |        |       |         |           |\n|                        |       | Hajong.   |        |       |         |           |\n\n#### THE KUKI SUB-FAMILY\n\n| New Kuki. | Old Kuki. | Lumyang. | Manip\u00fari. | Looe. | Lushai. | Sokte. | Shindie or Poi. | Kasai. | Poeron. | Maring. |\n|-----------|-----------|----------|-----------|-------|---------|--------|-----------------|--------|---------|---------|\n| Thado.    | Bete.     | Anal Namfan. |         | Scomai. | Undro. | Chairel. |                 |        | Songbu. | Saibu.   |\n| Changsen. | Rangkhol. | Khelma.   | Chobte.  | Aimole. | Pooroom. | Kom. | Kuireng. | Karum. | Chern.   |         |\n## HILL TRIBES OF E.

IX.\u2014On the Saka, Samrat, and Gupta Eras. A Supplement to his Paper on Indian Chronology. By James Fergusson, D.C.L., F.R.S., V.P.R.A.S.\n\nPrefatory Note.\n\nThe following notes on Indian Chronology were written in 1874, and were originally intended for the pages of the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society. Before, however, they were printed off, I received a letter from Dr. B\u00fchler, of Bombay, in answer to one I had written to him, on hearing a rumour that he had found Kanishka's name in one of the Puranas. I consequently refrained from publishing them, till it was known what bearing this discovery might have on the questions at issue. In order to ventilate the question, however, I had them printed, and in March, 1875, circulated them among my friends. As nothing has since been heard of Dr. B\u00fchler's discovery, and recent excavations in Afghanistan throw new light on the question, I now submit them for republication where they were originally intended to appear.\n\nDuring the eleven years that have elapsed since I read to the Society my paper on Indian Chronology, some discoveries have been made and new facts brought to light, which have an important bearing on the subject. It seems it may now, consequently, be expedient to add a postscript or supplement to that paper, indicating how far they confirm or modify the views there put forward. I am the more induced\n\n1 Published in Vol. IV. n.s. of the Society's Journal, pp. 81-137. As that article contains all the references required, it will not be necessary to repeat them all here, but only such as have special reference to the new matter now brought forward.\nto attempt this, because I fancy that the mystery that has hung over the institution of the Eras of Vikram\u0101ditya and \u015a\u0101l\u012bvahana can now be cleared up, though it has hitherto misled and puzzled all Indian archaeologists since the days when Willford wrote his celebrated article on the subject, in the ninth volume of the Asiatic Researches, published in 1807.\n\nOf the new facts directly bearing on this subject, the most important is the discovery by Gen. Cunningham of a number of dated inscriptions, found at Mathura and in the Punjab, containing the name of the great Buddhist King Kanishka and those of his immediate successors.\n\nThese were first translated by Professor Dowson some time after my paper was read, and were published in the following volume of the Journal of this Society. They have since then been carefully revised by the General himself, and republished in the third volume of his Archaeological Reports, pp. 29 et seqq. Their results have also been given to the world by Mr. Thomas, in his Essay on Ancient Indian Weights, forming the Introduction to Marsden, pp. 46 et seqq.\n\nPractically, the result is the following list of Kings, copied from the last-named authority:\n\n**INDO-SCYTHIAN INSCRIPTIONS.**\n\n*In the Indo-P\u0101li Alphabet.*\n\n| Kanishka. | Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Kanishka.

Samvat 61, 15th of Artemisius. |\n\nIn addition to these Bakhtrian-P\u0101li inscriptions, we have a record of a king called Moga (Moa f), on a copper plate from Taxila, wherein the Satrap Lis\u0101 Kusuluka (Kosala f) speaks of the 78th year of the \"great king, the great Moga,\" on the 6th of the month of Panamus.\nIn addition to the inscriptions bearing these names, Gen. Cunningham quotes a great number of others, with dates in the same Samvat Era, extending from the year 5 to the year 281, but without any kings' names in them. Their purport, however, and the form of the characters used, he considers sufficient to show that they form a connected series dating from one and the same Era, whatever that may be.\n\nProfessor Dowson and General Cunningham unhesitatingly adopt the Samvat of Vikram\u0101ditya, B.C. 56, as the Era indicated in the inscriptions. Mr. Thomas does not say so expressly in the Introduction above referred to; but in a letter he wrote to the Academy in December, 1874, he places them, for reasons there given at length, as all anterior to the Saka Era, A.D. 79. My conviction, on the contrary, is that they all date from the last-named Era, which I believe was, in fact, established by King Kanishka, who himself was a Saka king. It took, apparently, the name by which it is generally known from the fact that it was introduced into India during the reign of \u015a\u0101ta Karni II. of the Andhra dynasty of the Dekhan, and who was consequently chief of the \u015a\u0101tavahana\u00b9 or \u015a\u0101livahana race. He reigned, as I showed in my last paper (p. 122), A.D. 64 to 120.\n\nIn the first place, what we know of Kanishka is that he was not only one of the greatest Kings of the north of India, but that he was one of the most zealous Buddhists. If he was not the introducer, he was certainly the establisher of that religion in the north. He held the third, or, as some call it, the fourth, Convocation of Buddhism, and, with the assistance of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna, spread that religion into Thibet and beyond the Himalayas. To assert that such a King as this would condescend to adopt an Era established by a Brahmanical King of Ujjain from which to date his edicts and inscriptions, is so utterly incredible that it would require the very strongest evidence to induce any one to adopt it. That George III. should have adopted the French Republican\n\n\u00b9 J.B.B.R.A.S. vol. ix. pp. 239, 240.\nEra, and dated his coins and Acts in the years 5 or 9 of the \"R\u00e9publique une et indivisible,\" is intelligible enough, though unlikely, because in Europe dates from Eras have been so long in use that they are indispensable necessities, and must be used. But India in those days had no such user. Every reign was sufficient for itself, and, so far as we know, no Indian inscription or coin had any other date than that of the reign of the king in which it was made, till after the Christian Era. Under these circumstances, the idea of Kanishka adopting the Vikram\u0101ditya Samvat is, to say the least of it, most improbable.\n\nThe use of the term Samvat or Samvatsara may at first sight look like an argument in favour of the view adopted by Professor Dowson and General Cunningham; but the latter term (of which the former is merely an abbreviation) meaning simply year, it might be applied to any year or era, dating from any event. We find, indeed, Samvatsara continually used with Saka, and in inscriptions recording only the year of the reign of some king. In modern times, it is true, the term Samvat is applied almost exclusively to the Era of Vikram\u0101ditya, and, when used without qualification, is always understood to apply to that Era as contradistinguished from Saka or Saka K\u0101la, which is as generally applied to the Era of \u015a\u0101liyavahana. Samvat is equally applied to the Ballabhi\u00b9 Era; and K\u0101la to that of the Guptas\u00b2 and other Eras. The two words appear in fact to be used as we employ Era and Epoch, and without some distinctive qualification convey no distinct meaning or date.\n\nThis is so clear as to be hardly doubtful, and indeed Gen. Cunningham does not dispute it; but, he argues, \"this cannot be the Saka Era of A.D. 79, as we are quite certain that Kanishka flourished long before that date.\"\u00b3 This, no doubt, is the generally-received opinion; but when it is care-\n\n\u00b9 Tod's Rajasthan, vol. i. p. 801, and in all those copperplate grants in J.R.A.S Vol. I. n.s. p. 260, etc.\n\u00b2 J.B.B.R.A.S. vol. viii. p. 124.

The evidence, such as it is, is purely Numismatic, and this of a more than usually unsatisfactory nature. So long as the investigation is confined to the Baktrian Kings, the sequence is clear, and the dates certain, within very narrow limits, till after Pantaleon or Hermeus, 120 to 130 B.C.\\(^3\\) We then get among a set of barbarian kings, who copied the Greek coins more or less perfectly or intelligently, but in such a manner that neither the sequence nor the dates can be determined with anything like certainty; and during the whole period which elapsed between the fall of the Greco-Baktrian Kingdom and the reign of Kanishka there is not one name, except that of Gondophares, that we ever heard of before, nor one event which can be synchronized with anything known from any other history. The Chinese, it is true, tell us of the invasion of the Yuechi and other Scythian tribes, which during that period pushed the Greek dynasties out of Baktria towards India, and gradually established themselves within the line of the Indus, and founded kingdoms in India itself; but they do not mention a single king or individual whose name can be satisfactorily identified with any name, on any coin, or in any inscription; nor is there any event mentioned by them which corresponds with anything we gather from Indian sources.\n\nAs long ago as 1841, Wilson\\(^4\\) had recognized more than fifteen Barbarian kings as reigning in the north-west of India between Pantaleon and Kanishka; allowing these only thirteen years apiece, they are sufficient to occupy the 200 years (120+79) that existed between these two kings, on the idea that Kanishka was the founder of the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *Indische Alterthumskunde*, vol. ii. p. 411 et seqq.\n\n\\(^2\\) Cunningham's most recent discussion of this question is in a series of papers in the recent volumes of the Numismatic Chronicle; but its details are frequently referred to and enforced in his Geography of Ancient India and Archaeological Reports.\n\n\\(^3\\) *Wilson's Ariana Antiqua*, p. 300.\n\n\\(^4\\) *Ariana Antiqua*, p. 300 et seqq.\nSaka Era. Many more names have since been added, and to compress the whole within a century, which the Samvat theory involves, is so contrary to all experience, that, without some direct testimony in its favour, this view may safely be rejected.\n\nIn this maze of conjectures there is one fact we can rely upon. In a Tope which Kanishka built at Manikyala, he buried, along with many of his own, seven coins of the Roman Consular period. These have been identified by Raoul Rochette and others, and it has been ascertained that they extend down to A.U.C. 711, or B.C. 43. But these foreign coins are so worn with use as to be hardly distinguishable, while his own are fresh. Some considerable time must therefore have elapsed before they reached India in that condition. How long we must allow for this it is impossible to say; but this at least is certain, Kanishka was living and on the throne after B.C. 43. But in so far as this evidence goes, it is just as likely he may have been there 100 or 150 years after that time as 10 or 15 years.\n\nNo one has yet ventured to suggest any good reason why Kanishka should select seven wretched, worn silver Consular coins of Rome, to bury with his own gold pieces, when he could have selected hundreds of better examples from the Greek and Baktrian mintages at his command. It certainly was not their beauty, or value, nor their rarity, for at that time, after the defeat of Crassus, he might have got Roman coins by the bushel if he wanted them. They evidently had some sacred value independent of any numismatic considerations. They might have been the peculium of some Buddhist apostle who travelled in foreign parts\u2014who went, perhaps, as far as Rome\u2014or who acquired sufficient sanctity to be honoured by a Tope\u2014but that could hardly have been within a century after his death. The case is different with the\n\n---\n\n1 Thomas's list, published in his edition of Prinsep, vol. ii p. 178 et seqq., contains 38 names, of which probably 24 may be ascribed to the Greco-Baktrian Kingdoms; the remaining 14 are Barbaric Kings; but how many more there may be we do not know.\n2 J.A.S.B. vol. iii. p. 559, pl. xxiv.\n3 Journal des Savans, 1836, p. 74; Thomas's Prinsep, vol. i. p. 148.\nRoman gold coins recently found in Afghanistan; they are the best, and most valuable of the age to which they belong, and worthy of being associated, as they are found, with those of Kanishka. Be this, however, as it may, until it can be shown that these Consular denarii were placed in this Tope for some secular purpose, and not because they had become sacred from the use they had been put to, or from having belonged to some person who had become sacred, their value as an indication of the date of the Tope, or of its builder, is nil, and may safely be put on one side, for the present at least.\n\nAs hinted above, we find the name of Gondophares among the list of kings who reigned in the north-west of India, certainly subsequent to the fall of the Greek dynasties, and as certainly anterior to Kanishka.\\(^1\\)\n\nNow the name is familiar to us as that of a king to whom St. Thomas is said to have gone, and by whom, according to others, he was murdered. All that is related of his mission to India may probably be mere legendary fables, and which I certainly do not intend to attempt to investigate here. The one point that bears on our argument is that the legend\u2014assuming it to be such\u2014was probably invented in the second or third century after the Christian Era. The traditions are repeated as established facts by Eusebius\\(^2\\) and Socrates in the fourth.\\(^3\\) Whether true or not, it seems more than probable that those who related or invented these legends\u2014probably in Babylonia at an early age\u2014must have known who was the king reigning at Taxila at the time St. Thomas is supposed to have visited the East. That certainly was after A.D. 33, probably before A.D. 50.\n\nThe one point that interests us here is the inquiry whether those who wrote the history or invented the legend of St. Thomas, had the means of knowing what was the name of the king who ruled the north-west of India between these dates. For more reasons than it is worth while to adduce here, my conviction is, that ample means were available for\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Wilson's Ariana Antiqua, p. 340; Thomas's Prinsep, vol. ii. p. 214.\n\n\\(^2\\) Hist. Eccles. i. 13, iii.\n\n\\(^3\\) Hist. Eccles. i. 19.\nthis purpose; and, if this is so, it is inconceivable that they should have neglected them, and attached a wrong name to the legend. If this is so, it is almost impossible that Kanishka could have ascended the throne before A.D. 79, because, if this can be maintained, we have to find room for the whole Kadphises group of Kings between Gondophares and his accession. The difficulty is thus rather the other way, and certainly under no circumstances, if this view of the case be correct, could Kanishka have ascended the throne much before A.D. 79.\n\nQuite recently, Mr. W. Simpson, in excavating the Ahin Posh Tope, near Jellalabad, found in the centre of it a reliquary chamber, in which were deposited eighteen gold coins lying loose, in excellent preservation, and two more in a small gold reliquary. Of these, ten belonged to Kadphises; six to Kanerki or Kanishka; one of them had an image of Buddha on the reverse, with his name in Greek characters; one was of Oerke or Huvishka, and three were Roman. Of these last one was of Domitian, another of Trajan, and the third of the Empress Sabina, the wife of Hadrian. The last-named, which is very much worn, proves that the Tope could not have been erected before 120 A.D. and may be as late as 140 or even 150.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe first inference from this is, that it is, to say the least of it, most extremely improbable that the age of great Kanishka should be so distant from that of this Tope, as the Mathura inscription, above quoted, would make him, if the inscriptions were dated from the Vikram\u0101ditya Samvat. 9 and 18 from that Era would place him 47 and 38 B.C., and adding the age of the Tope, as ascertained from the coins, would make the interval 170 to 190 years, which is certainly too great. If, however, the inscriptions are dated from the Saka Era, these numbers would be 88 and 97 A.D., and allowing for the Huvisaka date, 47\u201348, equally 126\u2013127 A.D. would accord perfectly with the date arrived at from the Roman coins\u2014130 to 140 A.D.\n\n\\(^1\\) These particulars are taken from a paper by Dr. Hoernle, supplemented by one by General Cunningham, reported in the proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal for March to August, 1879, p. 205, et seqq.\nAnother excavation, which has recently been made in the same neighbourhood, confirms this view in a most satisfactory manner. While Mr. Simpson was excavating the Ahin Posh Tope, Mr. Beglar was employed by General Cunningham to explore another at Ali Musjid. In this, I learn from a private letter from the General, he found three gold coins of Bazo Aho, or Vasudeva, to whose age he consequently ascribes its erection. Now if we assume that the Vasudeva inscriptions at Mathura are from the Vikram\u0101ditya Samvat, his dates 83 and 93 would correspond with 27 and 42 A.D., and if this was the case, it seems most strange that no coin of his was found in the Ahin Posh Tope. If, on the contrary, however, he used the Saka Era, these dates would be 162 and 177 A.D., which would at once account for their absence there, and give us a reasonable limit in the other direction for the date of that Tope.\n\nAt the time General Cunningham sent me this information, he sent me six photographs of the Ali Musjid Tope, and so far as I can form an opinion, from its architecture and the sculptures with which it is adorned, the difficulty is now all the other way. These represent the doctrines of an advanced Mah\u0101y\u0101na school, such as is not found in India in any case before the fourth or fifth centuries, and though it is probable that this form of Buddhism was introduced earlier in Gandhara than in India proper, the difficulty is to understand how this Ali Musjid Tope can be so early as even 177 A.D. If it were in India, any one who has studied the subject would certainly believe it was one or two centuries more modern.\n\nAlthough these two discoveries of coins may not in themselves be sufficient to prove, absolutely, that all the Mathura dates are from the Saka Era, with the other evidence adduced, they make out so strong a case that it seems almost impossible to doubt its being so. If this is admitted, it follows as a matter of course that the Vikram\u0101ditya Samvat was not known till long after the age of the great King of Ujjain, in the sixth century, from whom its name was derived.\n\nOne other curious piece of evidence bearing on this subject\nhas recently been brought to light. In one of the inscriptions copied from the Badami caves by Mr. Burgess, and translated by Prof. Eggeling in the number for November, 1874, of the Indian Antiquary, the date is given in the following terms: \"Sri Manguli\u015bvara, who in the 12th year of his reign\u2014500 years having passed since the coronation of the King of the Sakas.\" Here, therefore, in an inscription which is older than any manuscript we now possess, we have a distinct statement that it was not any defeat of the Sakas, but the inauguration of one of their Kings, that gave rise to the Era\u2014and who was that King? I do not think any one at all familiar with the history of India about this Era would hesitate long in fixing on Kanishka, and with the evidence of his own dates, and that above adduced, the fact seems to me to be established almost beyond dispute; more particularly if it can be shown, as I hope to do presently, that the Vikram\u0101ditya Samvat was not invented till long after Kanishka's time.\n\n**Vikram\u0101ditya Samvat.**\n\nIf the above reasoning is sufficient to make out even a *prima facie* case in favour of the institution of the Saka Era by Kanishka, it only tends to make the origin of the Vikram\u0101ditya Samvat more and more mysterious. That a conqueror should seek to commemorate his accession to power by the institution of an Era, is an intelligible historical event; but there is in this case no hint of rival kings or rival eras, and nothing that has come to light since I last wrote on the subject now induces me to modify what I then said (pp. 131, 2). No authentic traces then existed of any King bearing the name or title of Vikram\u0101ditya having lived in the first century before Christ, and none have since been brought to light; nor has it been possible to point to any event as occurring B.C. 56 which was of sufficient importance to give rise to the institution of an era for its commemoration.\n\n---\n\n1 Archaeological Report on the Districts of Belgam and Kuladji, London, 1875, p. 24.\nFinding no other plausible suggestion available in 1869, I was induced to adopt the theory proposed by Mr. Justice Newton, to the effect that the Era of 56 B.C. was instituted by Nahapana, the Viceroy of some foreign King called Kshaharatra,\\(^1\\) who was all-powerful in the west some time not very distant from the Christian Era before or after. He, at all events, was the first of the line of Sah Kings, so called, of Guzerat, and it certainly is from his Era, or that of his master, that all their coins are dated. Further familiarity with the inscriptions and with the architecture of the western caves appears to me to have rendered this view untenable. The architectural evidence has been developed in my volume on Indian Architecture since published. The historical is mainly based on the celebrated Junaghur inscription of Rudra Dama, which is dated in the year 72 from the same Era from which all the coins of these kings are dated. In it he boasts \"that, after twice conquering the S\u0101ta Karni, Lord of Dakshin\u0101patha, he did not completely destroy him on account of their near connexion, and thus obtained glory.\" And he boasts of conquering, among other countries, Anupa, Saurashtra, Asva Kutcha, Kukura, Aparanta, etc.\\(^2\\)\n\nA little further on in our history, Gotamiputra, in whose reign the Era was established which was afterwards adopted by the Guptas and Ballabhis, boasts, in an inscription in a cave at Nassick, that he had conquered among others all the countries above enumerated, and as having re-established the glory of the S\u0101tavahana dynasty, and destroyed the race of Khagarata.\\(^3\\) All this reveals a state of matters that will not accord with the Vikram\u0101ditya Era, but does perfectly agree with that of \u015a\u0101livahana.\n\nAssuming that the S\u0101ta Karni dynasty is correctly represented in the Puranas, as enumerated by me in my previous essay at p. 122, and which I see no reason for doubting, Rudra Dama would, on the assumption that the dates were Vikram\u0101ditya Samvat, have been reigning A.D. 16 (72\u201456),\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) J.B.B.R.A.S. vol. v. p. 53.\n\\(^2\\) J.B.B.R.A.S. vol. viii. p. 119.\n\\(^3\\) J.B.B.R.A.S. vol. ix. p. 238.

But if we assume that it was in 151 A.D. (79+72), it would coincide with the reign of the third king of that name, and at a time when, so far as we can judge from the length of the reigns, and the careless way they are enumerated in the Puranas, the fortunes of the family were considerably depressed; and it is little more than a century and a half after this time that Gotamiputra restored the fortunes of his family. Had three hundred years elapsed between these two events, the family could never have attained the position it did.\n\nAnother point of more importance is that the dates on the Sah coins\u2014from whatever era they are calculated\u2014extend only to 270\u201371, or very doubtfully to 292.\\(^1\\) If these are from the Vikram\u0101ditya Samvat, they must have ceased to reign in A.D. 214, or at the latest 236, and there would have been no Khagaratas for Gotamiputra to humble after 312. On the other hand, if calculated from A.D. 79, their final extinction would have been in 349, or at latest 371. So that, though humbled by Gotamiputra, they overlap the Gupta Era to some extent, which it seems is almost indispensable to account for the mode in which the Sah coins overlap and run into those of the Gupta series, on which Mr. Thomas so strongly, and, it appears to me, so correctly insists.\\(^2\\)\n\nThis substitution of the Saka Era for the Samvat brings what we know of the history, with what we learn from the inscriptions, and gather from the coins, so completely into accordance, that I can hardly doubt now that it is the correct view of the matter, and certainly more in accordance with the facts than that I previously adopted.\n\nBefore leaving this branch of the subject, it may be as well to point out that the new Samvat or Era, A.D. 319, which was established in the reign of Gotamiputra, and from which the\n\n\\(^1\\) J.R.B.R.A.S. vol. viii. p. 28.\n\\(^2\\) Essay on the Sah Kings of Saurashtra, J.R.A.S.

It seems simply to have been four cycles, of 60 years each, after Saka\u201479 + 60 \u00d7 4. That the people who then ruled Western India were Yavanas, Sakas, Turushcas, and other tribes of Scythian origin, is abundantly clear from history, as well as from all the ethnological and religious data we can gather; and the cycle of 60 years is, and always was, the favourite and general mode of reckoning with them. To enable the dates in the new era to be easily convertible into those of the old, it was necessary some even number should be adopted, and that is what was apparently done on this occasion.\n\nIf this last prop is knocked away, I am not aware of any direct evidence for the existence of a Vikramaditya Era in the first century B.C., nor for so long a time afterwards, so long indeed that it seems impossible to connect the two. Bhan Daji, for instance, says he knows of no inscription dated in this Samvat before the eleventh century of the Christian Era; and, whatever may be said of his deficiencies in other branches of the subject, few men were so familiar with the data and more capable of giving an opinion on this subject. General Cunningham goes nearly as far. He says the Samvat of Vikramaditya was not used as early as 826; though, somewhat inconsistently, he says in the same volume, that the earliest inscription he knows dated in the\n\n1 \"Le mot samvatsara signifie ann\u00e9e; c'est comme, si on disait r\u00e9volutions annuelles. Ce samvatsara est fond\u00e9 sur la marche de Jupiter et du Soleil. . . . Sa r\u00e9volution est de soixante ans, voil\u00e0 pourquoi on le nomme Shadabda (it should be Shasthyabda, from Shashti 'sixty,' and Abda 'year'), d'un mot qui signifie soixante ans.\" To this M. Reinand adds in a note:\u2014\"Il me semble r\u00e9sulter de l'ensemble du passage que le cycle sexagesimal non seulement \u00e9tait propre \u00e0 une certaine partie de l'Inde, mais qu'il \u00e9tait d'une institution r\u00e9cente.

C'est donc que ce cycle a pris naissance, il y est d'un usage imm\u00e9morial.\" Journal Asiatique, series 10, vol. IV, pp. 281\u20132. In this conjecture M. Reinand seems certainly to be mistaken. 959 may be the year of its application to the Samvat of Vikramaditya, as we hope to show presently; but it was applied to the Gupta Samvat in 319 A.D.\n\n2 J.H.B.R.A.S., vol. ix. p. 242.\n3 Archaeological Reports, vol. ii. p. 266.\nVikram\u0101 Era is 811 or A.D. 754. As he does not say, however, what inscription he refers to, we may suspect his first assertion is the more correct one, till proof to the contrary is adduced. So far as I know, no inscription of so early a date has yet been published; and, if this is so, it is almost inconceivable that an era established before the birth of Christ could have lain so long dormant, and then have been so curiously revived, and so generally adopted.\n\nAssuming, for the nonce, that what was said above is sufficient to explain, at least provisionally, the origin of the Saka Era, the solution of the difficulties regarding the rival Era will, I believe, be found in the correct interpretation of two passages in the Raja-Tarangini, combined with one in Albiruni.\n\nThe first in the Kashmir history, when narrating the events of the Aditya dynasty, which certainly did not commence before the middle of the fourth century, it is said, \"Ayant fait venir ensuite, d\u2019un autre pays, Prat\u0101p\u0101ditya parent du roi Vicram\u0101ditya, ils le sacr\u00e8rent souverain de l\u2019Empire.\n\n\"D\u2019autres induites en erreur ont \u00e9crit que ce Vicram\u0101ditya fut le m\u00eame que combattit les \u00c7akas; mais cette version est rejet\u00e9e.\"\n\nSome way further on, under the following dynasty, or that of the Gonerdy\u0101 line restored, we have: \"Dans le m\u00eame temps \u2014 the death of Hiranya \u2014 l\u2019heureux Vicram\u0101ditya, appel\u00e9 d\u2019une autre nom Harcha, r\u00e9unit comme Empereur \u00e0 Udjdjayin\u012b l\u2019empire de l\u2019Inde sous un seul parasol.\n\n\"Employant la fortune comme moyen d\u2019utilit\u00e9 il fit fleurir les talents, c\u2019est ainsi qu\u2019encore aujourd\u2019hui les hommes de talent se trouvent la t\u00eate haute au milieu des riches.\n\n\"Ayant d\u2019abord d\u00e9truit les \u00c7akas, il rendit l\u00e9ger le fardeau\n\n---\n\n1 Arch.

That the first Vikram\u0101ditya, the friend of Prat\u0101p\u0101ditya, was so near in date the second\u2014he, in fact, appears to have been his grandfather\u2014as to be confounded with him, and to have the name of Sakari applied to him, which in fact belonged to his grandson, the real destroyer of the Sakas.\n\nThe passage in Albiruni is to the following effect: \"L'\u00e8re de Saca, nomm\u00e9e par les Indiens Sacak\u00e2la, est post\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle de Vieram\u0101ditya de 135 ans. Saca est le nom d'un prince qui a r\u00e9gn\u00e9 sur les contr\u00e9es situ\u00e9es entre l'Indus et la mer (le Golf du Bengale). Sa r\u00e9sidence \u00e9tait plac\u00e9e au centre de l'Empire (Muttra?), dans la contr\u00e9e nomm\u00e9e Aryavartha. Les Indiens le font na\u00eetre dans une classe autre que celle des (Kehatrias?) quelques-uns pr\u00e9tendent qu'il \u00e9tait Soudra et originaire de la ville de Mansoura. Il y en a m\u00eame qui disent qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas de race Indienne, et qu'il tirait son origine des r\u00e9gions occidentales. Les peuples eurent beaucoup \u00e0 souffrir de son despotisme, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il leur vint du secours de l'Orient. Vikram\u0101ditya marcha contre lui, mit son arm\u00e9e en d\u00e9route, et le tua sur le territoire de Korour, situ\u00e9 entre Moulton et le Ch\u00e2teau de Louny.

I do not, think, however, that any one who is even moderately acquainted with the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Loc. cit., p. 76.\n\n\\(^2\\) Reinaud, Extraits d'Albiruni, Journal Asiatique, 4th s\u00e9rie, tom. iv., p. 282. The principal passages bearing on the subject have already been printed in this Journal by Mr. Thomas, Vol. XII., pp. 14 and 44; so that it will not be necessary to repeat them here; but the whole chapter ought to be read by every one who wishes to understand how confused and artificial the whole system of eras was among the Hindus in Albiruni's time.\nmedieval history of India, and the part the Sakas played after the time of the Andhras,\\(^1\\) can doubt that these two accounts refer to the same events. The first question, therefore, is to ascertain their real date, the second to find out when and why it was altered.\n\nIn my previous essay (p. 100) I set down the date of Vikram\u0101ditya's death as occurring A.D. 530. To this I shall return presently; but, meanwhile, in order to make clear what follows, it may be expedient to assume that this was erroneous to the extent of, say 20 years, and that that event took place A.D. 550, or thereabouts. The battle of Koriur and the extermination of the Sakas may, therefore, have occurred 544, when Sri Harsha Vikram\u0101ditya was in the plenitude of his power, as evidenced by his having in that year established his servant Matri Gupta on the throne of Kashmir.\n\nAssuming this for the nonce, what appears to have happened is this. About or before the year A.D. 1000 the struggle with the Buddhists was over, and a new era was opening for the Hindu religion, and a revival among the Hindu dynasties;\\(^2\\) and it was then determined to reform the Calendar in a sense favourable to the new state of affairs. The Era then most in use was that of Saka, established, as I believe, by the Buddhist Kanishka, and certainly generally used by Buddhists in all their inscriptions. It was consequently deemed necessary to institute some new era to supersede it. That of 319 had also been employed by Buddhists, but the Guptas had at that time passed away, and so had the Ballabhis, and both were insignificant and of doubtful orthodoxy. Their Era would not therefore suit. The old Eras\u2014the Kali Yug, Mahabharata, etc.\u2014as Albinuri says, involved such lengthened periods, \"qu'on avait renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 en faire usage.\"\\(^3\\) In consequence of this, in looking back through their history for some name worthy to dignify the Era, and some event of sufficient importance to\n\n\\(^1\\) Wilson's translation of Vishnu Purana, p. 477.\n\\(^2\\) See Walter Elliot, J.R.A.S. Vol. IV. p. 10 et seqq.\n\\(^3\\) Journal Asiatique, loc. cit. p. 280.\nmark its commencement, they hit on the name of Vikram\u0101ditya as the most illustrious known, and his victory of Kor\u016br as the most important event of his reign.\n\nThe date, however, of that battle (A.D. 544) was too recent for their purpose. There were numberless events anterior to that time, which had not been forgotten, and required to be dated, and if they adopted it literally, they must have counted backwards from it, as well as forwards, as we do from the Christian Era; and no chronologer in his senses would do this if he could help it. They consequently established two new Eras. First by adding 10 cycles of 60, or 600 years to the date of 544, establishing one dignified by the name of Vikram\u0101ditya 56 years B.C. They then introduced another 10 centuries, or 1000 years, before the same date, or 456 B.C., and called it that of Harsha, from the other half of his name. The latter never came much into use, and we only know of its existence from Albiruni. The former eventually superseded all others in Hindu chronology.\n\nThe following two passages extracted from Albiruni's celebrated work are sufficient to show how absolute the confusion was in the Hindu mind with regard to eras and epochal dates, at the time he wrote (A.D. 1032). He does not profess to understand them himself, and it is consequently only from extraneous information that we can now make anything of them; but properly used they do seem to throw very considerable light on several vexed questions of Indian chronology. The first is as follows:\n\n\"On emploi ordinairement les \u00e8res de Sri Harscha, de Vicramaditya, de Saca, de Ballabha, et des Gouptas.\"\u2014p. 280.\n\n\"D'apr\u00e8s cela en s'en tenant \u00e0 l'an 400 de l'an de Yezderdjed, on se trouve sous l'ann\u00e9e 1488 de l'\u00e8re de Sri Harscha\u2014l'an 1088 de l'\u00e8re de Vicramaditya\u2014l'an 953 de l'\u00e8re de Saca\u2014\n\nIn order to illustrate what is meant by this, I may mention that when investigating chronological questions, before writing my work on the \"True Principles of Beauty in Art,\" I found the inconvenience so great, that I was induced to propose the introduction of a Decimal Era, 10,000 years B.C. The first year of Christ was consequently 10,001. The present year 11,880. In other words, by adding one digit to the left, the whole was reduced to a consecutive series from before the oldest date known to the present date.

The first, as mentioned above, is that the 240 years, or with the Lokakala 242 \u2014 was 4 cycles of 60 years added arbitrarily to the Saka Era without any special reference to any historical event, by a Scythic or Turanian people who were in the habit of using that cycle, and thus most appropriate to the Buddhists. The 600 years, or 606 with the Lokakala, was a most ingenious invention of the Aryan Brahmans in order to combine their own cycle of 100 years with the Buddhist cycle of sixty, and the only question is, when it was invented, and when it commenced. It could hardly have been from 319, as Albiruni seems to have supposed, for, if General Cunningham is correct, we have dates in this Samvat before 919, or with the Lokakala 927, which, according to this theory, would be the earliest possible date for its establishment (319 + 600 = 919). Besides, there seems no reason for supposing that the Brahmans ever adopted the Saka Era or its sub-\nordinate Gupta Samvat to date from. It is very much more probable that they would employ the 600 years in fixing an era 135 years earlier than the Buddhist Saka, and 600 years before the most notable event in the reign of the great Vikram\u0101ditya\u2014the Battle of Kor\u016br, which happened in 544 A.D. This probability arises almost to a certainty, when we find the Brahmins employing ten of their own cycles of 100 years each, to found a second era 1000 years before the same date of 544, or in 456 B.C., and calling it also by the first part of the name of that king or \u015ar\u012b Harsha.\n\nNo one pretends that any such era existed in the fifth century B.C., and the fact that one of these two eras was exactly 600 years, and the other one exactly 1000 years, before 544 A.D.; and that both were called by the names of the great king of Ujjain; are coincidences so remarkable that it seems impossible to account for them, except in some such manner as I have suggested.\n\nThe advantage gained by fixing on an earlier date than any of the eras currently in use, was evident enough. By simply adding 135 to any Saka date, the corresponding Samvat date could be obtained; and by the reverse process of deducting 135 years, Samvat dates could be converted into those of Saka. So, too, by adding or subtracting 375, Gupta or Ballabh\u012b dates could be converted into those of the new era. Had the new starting-point been subsequent to either of these then fashionable eras, a complication would have been introduced which would have been most perplexing.\n\nIf the celebrated Bhoja of Dhar, who is said to have ascended the throne about A.D. 1035, had been a little earlier, I would have been inclined to ascribe the introduction of the new era to him. He is fabled to have found and dug up the celebrated but long-buried throne of the great Vikram\u0101ditya, which I cannot but consider as a metaphorical allusion to some such event; and he was certainly one of the most prominent characters in this eleventh century revival. But I fear his date is too near the time when Al-Biruni was\n\n---\n\n1 Tod's Annals of Rajasthan, vol. i. p. 800.\n2 Asiatic Researches, vol. ix. p. 177; Journ. Asiatique, 1844, p. 250.\nwriting his book, for our purposes, and that we must look for some earlier king as the originator of the new system.\n\nIn so far as the main argument is concerned, it is of comparatively little consequence by whom, or at what time this new era was instituted; meanwhile, however, we get a hint of what was going on from Sir Walter Elliot's paper in our 4th vol. (p. 14). In Saka 998, A.D. 1076, \"Kali Vikram,\" with the title of Tribuvana Malla, usurped the kingdom. Having set aside the ancient Saka, he established the Vikram Saka in his own name.\" In another inscription he is described \"as rubbing out the Saka and instituting the Vikram Era in its stead;\" and this seems at that time to have been going on everywhere. It may, however, have been changed earlier by others, but it certainly was about this time that the permanent change was effected.\n\nThe most tangible objection to this view of the matter\u2014but it is much less serious than it at first sight appears\u2014is the difficulty of reconciling the date of the Battle of Korur (544) with what we know is Vikram\u0101ditya's date. In my previous paper it was fixed, principally on two statements of Hiouen- Thsang. Speaking in 640, he says: \"Suivant la tradition, le tr\u00f4ne \u00e9tait occup\u00e9, il y a soixante ans, par un roi nomm\u00e9 Siladitya.\" And on the next page he speaks of the \"cinquante ans qu'il resta sur le tr\u00f4ne.\" He was the son of the celebrated Vikram\u0101ditya, and, according to this account, 90 years elapsed between his accession to the throne and the time when the pilgrim was noting the events. The time is long, and Hiouen-Thsang is generally so careless about his dates, that we might, if necessary, cut 20 years off this period, were it not that the Hindus under the name of Chandra Sena give him exactly the same length of years, and place his father's death\u2014though it may be only an accidental coincidence\u2014in 541. For these and other reasons assigned in my previous paper, I would willingly let the date remain\n\n1 Vie de Hiouen-Thsang, vol. i, pp. 204-5.\n2 He is called Boja b. Feridun, and other Persian historians, who assign to him the same length of reign, 50 years.\u2014Dow's translation, vol. i. p. 13.\n3 Asiatic Researches, vol. IX. p. 176.\nas I then placed it, till the necessity for its readjustment is more clearly shown than it is at present.\\(^1\\)\n\nEven if we adopted this summary process with regard to Hiouen-Thsang, the synchronism with the Kashmir dynasties would present difficulties not easily overcome. Of course, by allowing the Kings of the Gonerdya dynasty, from Meghavahana to Matrigupta, the full length of reigns assigned to them, and shortening those that come after, to the accession of Durlabhaverddhana,\\(^2\\) to a proportional extent, a synchronism might be established, even if the twenty years were retrenched, and it is possible this might represent the facts, though it looks improbable. On the whole, I prefer assuming that those who set to work to adjust the chronology in the tenth or eleventh century did not know the date of the Battle of Kor\u00fbr within 20 years, and placed it in 544, instead of 524, which appears to be the true date.\\(^3\\)\n\nIn whatever manner this little discrepancy of 20 years may be accounted for, the great fact still remains, that Sr\u00ee Harsha Vikram\u00e2ditya Sakari lived and defeated the Sakas at the Battle of Kor\u00fbr, in the first half of the sixth century of our Era; and the Hindus, for the sake of adjusting their Eras, placed these events in the first century before Christ. This is all I care to contend for at present; for, if it is admitted, it gets rid of an immense mass of rubbish which has perplexed every inquirer, from the time when Wilford wrote his celebrated essay on the same subject, to the present day. So long as such a monstrous perversion of truth remains unex-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The Areen Akbary, vol. ii. p. 49, places Bhowj's accession 485 A.D. or 541\u201356.

For this correction I am indebted to Gen. Cunningham's Geography of Ancient India, p. 91.\n\n\\(^3\\) In order to illustrate how this might happen, let us suppose the non-Christian inhabitants of a distant land, like the early Romans or Arthurian Britons, to establish an Era of their own independently of the Christian Era. If the Pagan Danes had conquered and been unconverted, they certainly would have made the attempt. Supposing they had selected the Departure of the Romans, the Battle of Badon Hill, or any great national event, at about that distance of time, to start from,\u2014could they have fixed it certainly within 20 years? I fancy not; and having the Christian Era to guide them, they ought to have done it much more easily than the Indians, who were always careless and uncritical as to dates or eras.\nposed, Hindu Chronology is impossible; if it is abolished, there is very little difficulty remaining.\n\nOne of the first effects of this clearance of the way, will be that a number of small problems that puzzled Albiruni and other chronologers will become easily explicable. Take, for instance, the Loka Kala. This is described by Albiruni as a mode of reckoning among the vulgar, \"comput du vulgaire,\" as distinguished from that of educated people, and consisted in adding one to the hundreds, as Easterns generally do to thousands, in order to prevent the last figure being altered,\u2014as in the famous instance of the 1001 nights of Arabia\u2014and in this instance stopping the calculation at 101, as if the common people did not require to look beyond that. The confusion it introduced is easily understood, and shows how careless and unscientific the Indians were in these matters.\n\nHe quotes two instances: one, the distance between the Saka Era and that of the Guptas, which we know was $240, 60 \\times 4$, neither more nor less; but according to this absurd mode of calculation is made 242. The other instance is an epoch of 600 years, which Albiruni does not know where to apply, but is evidently the $60 \\times 10$ which was used to adjust the Vikramaditya Samvat to the date of the Battle of Kurur, but is here called 606, and fits to nothing. His quoting these two illustrations, however, is a satisfactory confirmation of what has been above advanced. They are just the two figures required to prove the correctness of the theory here advocated.\n\nIt is the same, I believe, with half the figures scattered through the pages of Wilford. They may all be true figures, but in nine cases out of ten misapplied or misunderstood; but, if any one would take the pains now to readjust them, I hardly doubt but that their true application and meaning could be found out. But that, I am certainly not going to attempt here, though I wish to point it out as a source of information available for others.\n\nThe truth of the matter appears to be, Albiruni, like Wilford, collected together a vast mass of facts and dates connected with Indian Chronology; but neither of them had\n\n\\[^{1}\\text{Journal Asiatique, series iv. vol. iv. pp. 287-289.}\\]\nany such knowledge of the real history of the country as would enable them to ascertain their real value or sequence. We have now access to Wilford's authorities, and can judge how far he was right or wrong. But Albiruni, apparently, had access to documents now lost; and his work, when published in extenso, may afford us much additional information; but so far as I can judge from what has been already published, there is not one single fact that can be accepted at once, without careful examination, nor is there one that is of much value, unless supported by corroborative evidence.\n\n**Gupta Kala.**\n\nThere is one other point of some, though not very great, importance, which information obtained since 1869 has set at rest. When writing that essay, I was obliged to leave it undetermined (pp. 103, 107) whether the two inscriptions of 82 and 93 of the Gupta Kala belonged to the first or second Chandra Gupta. A paper written by Major Watson, and published in the *Indian Antiquary* for November, 1873, clears up that difficulty. We there learn that Chandra Gupta II. reigned 23 years after the conquest of Saurashtra by his son; that Kumara Pal Gupta reigned 20 years; and that Skanda Gupta succeeded him, but lost Saurashtra by the rebellion of his Senapati Bhattaraka, the founder of the Ballabhi family. Two years after this event Skanda Gupta died, and, as we are informed, \"at this time the Gupta race were dethroned by foreign invaders.\"\u00b9 From this it appears, undoubtedly, that the second arrangement I then proposed is the correct one, and that the above dates belong to Chandra Gupta II.; all those of the later kings are consequently now known within a year or two.\n\nThe Era from which these dates are taken never appeared to me doubtful; and this confirms me more and more in the conviction that it was from the Era that bears their name, A.D. 319. It could not be from the Saka Era, as has generally\n\n\u00b9 Indian Antiquary, vol. ii, p. 312.\nbeen assumed, from the fact that Albirani asserts that the Era that bears their name was \"apparently\" that of their destruction,\\(^1\\) because in that case Skanda Gupta must have lived and reigned for 94 years in addition to the 16 we already know, from inscriptions, he occupied the throne. A reign of 110 years seems impossible; and, if it is not so, it seems certain, for the reasons stated in my previous paper, that the Gupta Era, 319, is that from which their coins and inscriptions are dated.\n\nBesides this, the 146\\(^2\\) years from 319, which we know from their dated inscriptions that they reigned, is just the interval that is required to fill up the gap between the Ballabhis and their Era which they adopted on usurping the inheritance of the Guptas, two years before Skanda Gupta's death.\\(^3\\)\n\nOne other point of considerable importance to Indian history which arises from the fixation of this date (A.D. 465\u201370) for the destruction of the Guptas is, that it was almost certainly the White Huns who were the \"foreign invaders\" that struck the blow that stopped their career. At least, we learn from Cosmas Indicopleustes, writing 70 years after this time, that the Huns were a powerful nation in the north of India in his day, and, we may infer from what he says of them, had been settled there some time.\\(^4\\)\n\nOn the Bhitari L\u00e2t, Bhau Daji reads\u2014somewhat doubtfully, it must be confessed\u2014the fact that Skanda Gupta had fought, apparently with success, against the Hunas.\\(^5\\) But the great point is that it was just about this time that the White Huns broke loose and extended their incursions east and west, so that there is not only no improbability of their being the \"foreign invaders\" alluded to, but every likelihood they were so. No one, indeed, can, I believe, with the knowledge we now possess, read De Guignes' chapter on the White\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Journal Asiatique, series iv. vol. iv. p. 285.\n\n\\(^2\\) This date is from an unpublished copper-plate grant, in the possession of Gen.

It is true India is not mentioned there; but from the time of Bahram Gaur in 420, till the defeat of Firoze in 475, the Persians were waging an internecine war with these Huns, and nothing can be more likely than that the varying fortunes of that struggle should force them to seek the alliance of the then powerful Guptas, to assist them against their common foe.\n\nPrecisely the same impression is conveyed by what is said by Ferishtah and the Persian historians\\(^2\\) of the history of that time. Nothing can now, however, be more easily intelligible than the visit of Bahram Gaur to India when first attacked by the White Huns. His marriage with an Indian (? Gupta) Princess of Canouge; the tribute or assistance claimed by Firoze and his successors on the Persian throne, are all easily explicable, on the assumption that the two nations were at that time engaged in a struggle against a common enemy. This, too, explains the mention of the \u201cShah in Shahi\u201d on Kumara Gupta\u2019s Allahabad inscription.\\(^3\\) Hence, too, the decided Persian influence on the gold coinage of the Canouge Guptas,\\(^4\\) and the innumerable Sassanian coins of that period found in all parts of the north of India.\\(^5\\) In all this the Sassanians seem inseparably mixed with the Guptas. The Persians, however, came eventually victorious out of the war. The great Guptas were struck down at some date between 465\u201370, or very shortly afterwards. The struggle, however, was apparently continued for some time longer by a subordinate branch of their successors; inasmuch as we learn from an inscription found at Aphsar in Behar,\\(^6\\) that the fourth of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Vol. i. part ii. lib. iv. pp. 325 et seqq.\n\\(^2\\) Malcolm\u2019s Persia, vol. i. p. 118; Briggs\u2019s translation of Ferishtah, intro. lxxvii. et seq.; Dow\u2019s translation, p. 13.\n\\(^3\\) Journal Asiatic Soc.

But be this as it may, it brings us back to the time when the Battles of Kor\u00fcr and Maushari freed India from the Sakas and Hunas, who had long held her in hated subjection. That these two battles were fought between 524 and 544 appears to me hardly doubtful; and they thus fix one of the most important epochs in Medi\u00e6val Indian history. Indeed, so near each other are these two events in date, that I sometimes feel almost inclined to fancy they may be only different names for the same battle. At all events, they almost certainly represent parts of the same campaign which freed India in that age from the Yavanas; and that it was to commemorate the glories of these struggles that the Vikramaditya Samvat was afterwards instituted. This expulsion of the Yavanas was, too, the first serious blow that was struck at Buddhist supremacy, and from the effects of which it never afterwards completely recovered.\n\nTo make all this as clear to others as it is to myself, would require much more careful and elaborate working out than can be attempted in this place. But I feel convinced that if any one who had access to the same sources of information as De Guignes and Ferishtah, would re-write this chapter with special reference to India, availing himself of all the recent sources of information in that country, and combining it with what we learn from the Byzantine historians, he could easily restore to history one of the most interesting, and at the same time one of the most romantic, chapters in the history of India.\n\nNothing but a mistaken system of Chronology could have prevented all this being seen long ago, and now that these difficulties are being cleared away, we may hope that before\nlong this part of Indian history will be placed on a satisfactory basis.\n\nMy impression is, that this view of the Gupta Era would never have been considered doubtful, had it not been that the Chronology of that period has hitherto been based almost exclusively on Numismatic researches; and as it happens that the Andhras, or S\u0101tavahanas, being a native race, hardly coined money at all, they have been overlooked and their places filled by others. The wealth of ancient coins we find in India belongs almost exclusively to intruding foreigners, who came from or through Baktria, where they learnt the art of coining from the Greeks or their successors; and it was only at the time of the Guptas themselves that the indigenous races took extensively to coining, and the use of money. If the Andhras, however, did not coin money, they did better. They dug caves in the rocks, and covered them with inscriptions; and when these are read and their surroundings studied, they may regain their place in Indian history with a certainty that cannot be disturbed. The dates, however, of the Andhras or Andhrabhrityas, as they are usually called, are the only ones regarding which any uncertainty at present prevails, and till these inscriptions are more carefully examined than hitherto has been the case, they cannot be regarded with the same confidence as others referred to in the preceding pages.\nART. X.\u2014The Megha-S\u016btra. By Cecil Bendall, Fellow of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge.\n\nThe following article was originally suggested by a notice in Beal's\u00b9 \"Catena of Buddhist Scriptures from the Chinese.\" The s\u016btra is there selected as a type of the latest phase of Buddhist literature, not only on account of its own peculiarities, but owing to its religious importance among the Chinese, which caused the imperial rescript for its translation and general promulgation, of which an English version is there given. The two parts of which this s\u016btra is composed are mentioned as Nos. 15 and 16 of vol. 14 of the Tibetan \"Gyut,\" by Csoma K\u0151r\u00f6si in As. Res. xx. p. 529; the names of the translators fix its date as earlier than the ninth century. Finding that the Sanskrit original existed in the great, and hitherto unworked, mine of Northern Buddhist literature, the Wright Collection of Nepalese Sanskrit MSS. in the University Library of Cambridge, it was suggested to me by Prof. Cowell, to whose assistance I have been throughout deeply indebted, that it might prove generally interesting if an edition of the s\u016btra were prepared. A perusal, however, of the work showed such a preponderance of the objectionable peculiarities of this branch of Tantric literature, endless repetitions of words and thought, huge and meaningless conglomerations of epithets and titles, vast catalogues\u00b2 of names, and in fact such an entire absence of literary merit of any kind, that the project of preparing a complete edition was abandoned, and the following annotated abridgment drawn\n\n\u00b9 See also Fergusson, \"Tree and Snake Worship,\" p. 55, where some further account of the Chinese version is given, and one of its illustrations reproduced; the observations as to the date may be corrected, however, by a reference to Csoma (as presently quoted).\n\u00b2 e.g., the list of 177 snakes at the beginning.\nup. The text of these extracts is based on the Cambridge MS., of which I have made a nearly complete transcript, and which I call A, and the MS. in the Hodgson Collection of the Royal Asiatic Society (B), which I have collated for this article.\n\nA few preliminary remarks on these MSS. may be not superfluous.\n\nA, is a palm-leaf, 16 inches by 2 inches, 5 lines on each page, dated N.S. 494 = A.D. 1374. It is written in the peculiar and often very difficult handwriting of the Nepalese of the period; and abounds in errors such as the confusion of \u0936 and \u0937 and of \u0936 and \u0937, which seem to show the scribe's knowledge of Sanskrit to have been very small indeed.\n\nB, on the other hand, though a modern paper transcript, is a fairly careful copy of a good original, and clearly has independent authority. Conjectural emendations of my own of the readings of A have been in very many cases confirmed. I am also indebted to the courtesy of Prof. Beal for help derived from a comparison of the Chinese transliterations of the mystic names of charms on page 297.\n\nThe following extracts, then, contain all the significant parts of the s\u016btra, the nature of the omitted portions being everywhere indicated. The text is founded on a comparison of the MSS., obvious blunders and vernacular barbarisms in either being passed by unnoticed, and the genuine differences of reading only being noted.

Even by charity; therein devas and men, snake-king, living in charity, are not burned by fire, nor hurt by weapons, nor carried away by water, nor slain by poison, nor overcome by a neighbour's host; they shall slumber sweetly, and sweetly they awake and are guarded by their own holiness, being glorified by the glory of great holiness, and are indestructible by this world with the world of devas, and gracious, and fair of countenance, and everywhere unhindered in their goings, with all griefs subsided, gladdened and endowed with all bliss.\n\nAnd hereafter, after the dissolution of the body, pervaded by human attributes, they are born in the Brahma-world, through the exercise of charity, O king. These, O king, are the praises of devas and men who live in charity.\n\nNow therefore, snake-king, ye must live with benevolent action of body, speech and mind. Again, further, snake-king, a dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b called 'Sarvasukhandad\u016b' must be put in action.

The caravanser\u0101i is called sangi \u2018the stone one.\u2019 It appears to have been one of the many caravanserais built in the sixth century by Anushirv\u00e1n the Just. Ruins of a caravanser\u0101i, exactly like this one, are to be seen at Ah\u00fa\u00e1n, a stage beyond Semn\u00e1n on the high road to Meshed, and there the legend says that it was one of Anushirv\u00e1n\u2019s constructions. The distribution of the rooms and stables in these two old caravanserais is very different from that of the more modern ones.\n\nSix miles further on, in the midst of the desert so well known in ancient times (Polyb. lib. x.), is a square mound of earth with a few fragments of pottery on it. This mound is called the caravanser\u0101i Kh\u00e1ki, that is, \u2018the earthen one.\u2019\n\nA few miles beyond Kh\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d, the second post stage from Teher\u00e1n, is the village Dastjird, with a mound and some ruined towers. A Mullah of the place told me that the true name of the village was Dast\u00e1jird. There may here have been, during the Sassanian period, a little fort or guard-house on the high road from Rey to Ecbatana. A reminiscence of the Sassanians may also be found in the names of some of the villages in this district; thus, we have Bahr\u00e1m\u00e1b\u00e1d and Fir\u00faz\u00e1b\u00e1d, and three \u2018abodes of the sun,\u2019 Khor\u00e1b\u00e1d, Khursh\u00edd\u00e1b\u00e1d, and Shems\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\nThe next place worthy of note is the village or district Mazdak\u00e1n, also written Mazdaq\u00e1n, some miles before\nNobar\u00e1n. There is a tradition of this district having been one of the last refuges of the followers of Mazdak, the religious impostor killed by order of An\u00fash\u00edrv\u00e1n in the earlier part of the sixth century.\n\nRegarding the river south of Mazdak\u00e1n, now called Rez\u00e1 Ch\u00e1i, it seems that it was formerly called Sefid R\u00fad. The Nuzhet-ul-Qul\u00fab speaks of Mazdak\u00e1n as \u201ca small town, a stream from which flows into the Sefid R\u00fad,\u201d and in the paragraph on S\u00e1veh it says, that \u201cits waters come from Mazdak\u00e1n;\u201d this is true of the Rez\u00e1 Ch\u00e1i, which, running into the Qara S\u00fa, waters a part of the S\u00e1veh plain. Should, however, the Rez\u00e1 Ch\u00e1i itself be meant, as the Mazdaq\u00e1n water running into the Sefid R\u00fad, we have the former Persian Sefid R\u00fad, \u2018white river,\u2019 changed into the Turkish Qaras\u00fa, \u2018black river,\u2019 which is very improbable.\n\nThe name of the village on the eastern side of the Blood Mountain, Q\u00e1n\u00ed-d\u00e1gh, ought to be Buy\u00fak\u00e1b\u00e1d, not B\u00fabuk\u00e1b\u00e1d; the former is mentioned as a large village belonging to Hamad\u00e1n in the Nuzhet-ul-Qul\u00fab.\n\nClose to B\u00fabuk\u00e1b\u00e1d is the village Mil\u00e1gird. The name may be derived from mel, \u2018a large pear, or wine;\u2019 it is, however, more likely a place from the Ashkanian period, meaning \u2018town of the Medes.\u2019 Moses Chorenenensis speaks of a Marag\u00edrd, an Armenian foundation of the sixth century B.C. (lib. i. 30). This may have been a later foundation; some mounds in the neighbourhood point to former importance.\n\nAt Neh\u00e1vend I was shown a gravestone, for many years supposed to be over the grave of the minister of Malik Sh\u00e1h Selj\u00faq\u00ed, Niz\u00e1m-ul-Mulk, who was killed at Neh\u00e1vend A.D. 641, but buried at Ispah\u00e1n. On the stone was found a Cufic inscription, which, to the astonishment of the Neh\u00e1vend\u00eds, showed the stone to belong to the grave of a T\u00e1her-ibn-\u00c1hmed, who died A.H. 575.\n\nNear Neh\u00e1vend is a village called M\u2019ad\u00ed Kereb, with the grave of \u00c1hmed-ibn-\u2019Omar, the grandson of M\u2019ad\u00ed Kereb, who fell in the same battle.\n\nBur\u00fajird is first mentioned in H\u00e1run-ur-Rash\u00edd\u2019s reign; it was then an unimportant village, but Ham\u00faleh, governor\nof the Jebel province, putting up his residence there, gave rise to its becoming a town. It is generally called a town of Little Lurist\u00e1n; it is, however, now separate from the Lurist\u00e1n province. The Selj\u00faq Burky\u00e1ruq, son of Malik Sh\u00e1h, died here A.H. 498.\n\nA mound near Bur\u00fajird, called Chiq\u00e1 Kibr\u00edt, may be the fortress Kibr\u00edt, mentioned in the Akr\u00e1d-N\u00e1meh, to which Izzud-d\u00edn Kersh\u00e1sp ibn N\u00far-ud-d\u00edn Mu\u1e25ammed, At\u00e1beg of Lurist\u00e1n, tried to retire when pursued by \u1e24us\u00e1m-ud-d\u00edn Khal\u00edl.\n\nKhorrem\u00e1b\u00e1d is mentioned in connexion with an event that happened A.H. 693 (1294). According to the Akr\u00e1d-N\u00e1meh, At\u00e1beg Jem\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn Kh\u00edzr was killed at Khorrem\u00e1b\u00e1d in that year by \u1e24us\u00e1m-ud-d\u00edn and Shems-ud-d\u00edn of the Lebeng\u00ed tribe. In the immediate neighbourhood of Khorrem\u00e1b\u00e1d is a small building, inside of which is to be seen a gravestone devoid of any inscription. It is called by some the grave of the prophet Khezr, others call it a qadamg\u00e1h of Khezr, that is, a place which he has visited. The latter account would be more probable, as Khezr is supposed to be still alive. The true explanation is, I suppose, that it is the grave of the murdered At\u00e1beg.\n\nKhorrem\u00e1b\u00e1d now lies on the right side of the river; the old town was situated on the left side. The most notable ruins on the site of the old town are a sixty-feet high circular tower built of bricks, with the remains of a Cufic inscription round the top\u2014the foundations of the walls which formed the building\u2014a masjid probably\u2014in which the tower stood\u2014part of a large aqueduct with a high stone wall\u2014and many walls of smaller buildings. A bridge, of which ten arches are still standing, led somewhat south of the present town from the right side of the river to the old town on the left. It was part of the old road, called the J\u00e1\u00edd\u00e1r road, to the Kerkeh valley, via J\u00e1\u00edd\u00e1r. The bridge leading to the present town is a modern construction, built about the beginning of this century by 'Al\u00ed Murd\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, governor of Lurist\u00e1n.\n\nOn the hill north-east of the town are the ruins of a\ncircular tower, the remains of a guebre dakhmeh; a little further on is an immense water cistern built of large roughly hewn stones.\n\nSomewhat north of the old town is a curious stone pillar with an inscription never yet, I believe, deciphered. The pillar has a height of 9\u00bd feet above the ground, is three feet long and twenty-eight inches wide. The inscription is on the four sides of the pillar, partly in Cufic, partly in Naskhi character; it looks very legible, but is not so. I have not been able to decipher all of it; indeed, the only parts that I have succeeded in reading were the first and second lines and part of the third; they are principally composed of names and titles, and offered little difficulty.\n\nSir Henry Rawlinson thought he had detected the name of Shuj\u00e1'ud-d\u00edn, the first At\u00e1beg of the Khursh\u00edd\u00ed dynasty, on the stone; I have not, however, been able to decipher this name. Mahm\u00fad-ibn-Mu\u1e25ammed, surnamed the right hand side of the Am\u00edr-ul-M\u00f3men\u00edn (the Khal\u00edfeh), yamin-i-Am\u00edn ul-m\u00f3men\u00edn, was a grandson of the great Malik Sh\u00e1h, who ascended the throne A.H. 511, and died at Hamad\u00e1n 15th Shev\u00e1l, 525 (A.D. 1118\u20131131). Shuj\u00e1'ud-d\u00edn died A.D. 1230. In the first and third lines I have read the name of the inscription Bursuq, having heard that a man of that name was a great Lur chief under the At\u00e1bega. Bursuq belonged to the now extinct S\u00e1k\u00ed branch of the B\u00e1lg\u00edr\u00edweh tribe. The date in the first line may be either 517 or 519.\n\nRegarding this stone, the Lurs say, as is almost always the case, that the inscription indicates to any one clever enough to read it the place where a treasure lies buried, but that no one has as yet read it.\n\nThe Khorrem\u00e1b\u00e1d district seems formerly to have been called Samh\u00e1. Regarding Samh\u00e1, the Akr\u00e1d-N\u00e1meh says that At\u00e1beg Shuj\u00e1'ud-d\u00edn sent his sons Bedr and Heidar from Manrud to Samh\u00e1 to fight the Jengerd\u00ed tribe. The sons went there and besieged Diz-i-siy\u00e1h. The citadel of Khorrem\u00e1b\u00e1d is, occasionally, at the present day, called Diz-i-siy\u00e1h; there is thus no doubt of the Khorrem\u00e1b\u00e1d fort\nhaving been called Diz-i-siy\u00e1h, the Khorrem\u00e1b\u00e1d plain or district, Samh\u00e1; this was in the thirteenth century. The Manr\u00fad district, from which, according to the \u00c1kr\u00e1d-N\u00e1meh, the Lur tribes originally came, is said to be the present M\u00e1l\u00e1\u00e1n-R\u00fad, north of J\u00e1idar, now inhabited by the Zarin\u00ed and R\u00e9ki tribes of the great \u2019Amaleh family.\n\nThe Sh\u00e1p\u00farkh\u00e1st of old geographers has been identified with Khorrem\u00e1b\u00e1d. I am, however, inclined to place Sh\u00e1p\u00farkh\u00e1st much further south. The many ruins in the J\u00e1idar plain, the existence there of the name of Sh\u00e1pur, in the old bridge in the Teng-i-Dul\u00e1bcheh, Pul-i-Sh\u00e1pur, and the distance given by Ibn Haukal, \u201cSh\u00e1p\u00farkh\u00e1st lies 22 farsakhs from Neh\u00e1vend,\u201d lead me to identify the present J\u00e1idar with the old Sh\u00e1p\u00farkh\u00e1st. The \u00c1kr\u00e1d-N\u00e1meh mentions a plain of Sh\u00e1pur in which a battle took place between Husam-ud-d\u00edn Khalil and Izz-ud-d\u00edn Kershasp; as, shortly before, Dehliz is mentioned, the plain of Sh\u00e1pur may have been Sh\u00e1p\u00farkh\u00e1st. J\u00e1idar is only a few miles distant from Dehliz. The country between Dehliz and J\u00e1idar is not very mountainous, and does not preclude the idea of its being possible for a battle being fought there; the hills are rounded off like downs, are easily passed, and have many small well-watered valleys. If we take Khorrem\u00e1b\u00e1d to be the old Sh\u00e1p\u00farkh\u00e1st, we get only half the distance from Neh\u00e1vend mentioned by Ebn Haukal.\n\nThe present road for artillery and heavy caravans, the so-called J\u00e1idar road, goes from Khorrem\u00e1b\u00e1d along the right side of the Keshg\u00e1n river as far as the Dul\u00e1bcheh pass\u2014there crosses the river\u2014then goes along the left side of it through the J\u00e1idar plain\u2014and over the Dum-i-Ch\u00fal pass into the Seimerreh or Kerkheh valley. This was also the old road from Samb\u00e1 to \u2019Arabist\u00e1n, as is proved by the old Pul-i-Sh\u00e1pur, the old paved way on the Dum-i-Ch\u00fal pass, and the old bridge over the Seimerreh close by. The road divided at this bridge, one road went over the bridge to the right side of the river, the other kept along the left side. The latter is easily traced; opposite the place called Derreh-i-Khazin\u00e9h the road is cut through the rocks. The cutting\nis five feet wide and about fifteen feet deep. The direct road from Sh\u00e1purkh\u00e1st to Seimerreh went over the Pul-i-Qamash\u00e1n. At Pul-i-Teng there was another old bridge; probably used for lighter caravans that went between Lurist\u00e1n and 'Arabist\u00e1n by the Ki\u00e1l\u00e1n road. Alexander the Great's road from S\u00fasa to Esbatana went along the right side of the Kerkhah and Seimerreh, past Seimerreh town, Sirw\u00e1n, etc. The Seimerreh is called Kerkeh after the \u0100b-i-Z\u00e1l has joined it a few miles below Pul-i-Teng.\n\nJust a little above the fording place of the Z\u00e1l river, and at a place where the river is very narrow, are the remains of three one-arched bridges; one ruin looks very ancient, another more modern, the third was built as late as 1830. These bridges are on the old road to Dizf\u00fal.\n\nAt the fording place over the Bel\u00e1dr\u00fad are traces of the old road, a stone pavement, and the ruins of a five-arched bridge; and a little further down is a modern bridge with one arch, of the four there were, still standing.\n\nHaving passed the Bel\u00e1dr\u00fad river, and the low sandstone mountains called Do K\u00fah, one enters the plain called Sahr\u00e1-i-L\u00far. Persian dictionaries give the meaning of L\u00far as a plain dug up by floods, exactly what this plain is. It consists of conglomerates covered by new alluvium, which every year in the rainy season is dug in deep trenches or river-beds by the floods from the mountains. The people of D\u00edzf\u00fal say L\u00far means a large unbounded plain. At any rate the name of the plain L\u00far has nothing in common with the name of the people L\u00far; one has a long, the other a short, u. Some old aqueducts come from the K\u00fah-i-V\u00e1n, and run here in a south-western direction. The aqueducts had their water from the Bel\u00e1dr\u00fad, I believe, and passed the ruins called Qala'h-i-Q\u00e1sem, lying on the slopes of the V\u00e1n mountain in the Teng-i-V\u00e1n. The ruins consist of a tower and several small-roomed buildings; the Lurs say Q\u00e1sem was a brother of Sh\u00e1pur II. (!)\n\nA few miles before D\u00edzf\u00fal, and after passing several ruined villages, we come upon a high mound called Chiq\u00e1 Charmeh, probably the remains of an \u00e1teshk\u00e9d\u00e9h, a fire temple.\nOn the Ki\u00e1l\u00e1n road from Khorrem\u00e1b\u00e1d to the Z\u00e1l river, I saw no traces of any old road.\n\nA peak in the southern extension of the Ki\u00e1l\u00e1n mountain is called Tuq-i-M\u00e1n\u00ed, or Chiq-i-M\u00e1n\u00ed (the Peak of M\u00e1n\u00ed). I was told that on the top of it were some chambers hewn into the rock, and that M\u00e1n\u00ed the painter (M\u00e1nes) was there hidden for a year before appearing to his disciples as a young man. In a line due north from the Chiq (or Chiq\u00e1) M\u00e1n\u00ed are the caves of Kepk\u00e1n or Koig\u00e1n (from Kepk \u2018a partridge,\u2019 Lur Koi), on the river of the same name, also with chambers cut into the rock, and still further north the caves of Jem\u00e1l Kel. The Lurs speak of these as dakhmehs.\n\nThe bridge of Dizf\u00fal is a Sassanian construction, but very much damaged.\n\nA little beyond Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, about ten miles from Dizf\u00fal, on the road from Dizf\u00fal to Sh\u00fashter, are the extensive ruins identified by travellers as the site of the city Jundi Sh\u00e1p\u00far. According to Oriental geographers, Jundi Sh\u00e1p\u00far was situated on a hill, and had well-watered date plantations and gardens. I believe Jundi Sh\u00e1p\u00far was really somewhat west, or south-west rather, of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d, where there would have been a greater water supply than could ever have existed at Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d. The few canals that come from the Ab-i-Diz end are cut somewhat above the town, through the easily broken conglomerate rocks, have as much water now as they formerly had, and could not give water enough for extensive date plantations or gardens. Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d has at present not a single date palm; Siy\u00e1h Mans\u00far, a village a short distance off, has only one palm. The distances given by Oriental geographers, for instance Abulfed\u00e1, who says from Sh\u00fashter to Jundi Sh\u00e1p\u00far is eight farsakhs, and from Jundi Sh\u00e1p\u00far to Sh\u00fash is six farsakhs, would coincide with the position of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d. Drawing an arc with a radius of eight farsakhs from Sh\u00fashter, and another with a radius of six farsakhs from Sh\u00fash, we get the point of intersection of the two arcs at Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d. But the road did not go in a straight line, and the radii would have to be considerably shortened. We should then get the point of section south-west of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d,\ncloser to the river, where there are many high mounds, many trees, and a more abundant water supply than at Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d. The farsakhs for this part of Persia I take at a little over three statute miles (23\u00bd to a degree of the equator); at the present day the inhabitants of 'Arabist\u00e1n distinguish between a farsakh-i-'ajem and a farsakh-i-'arab, calling the former about twenty per cent. longer. From different measurements of distances by myself, and the distances as given by the inhabitants, I got the figures 3\u00b7125 miles per farsakh, while the 'ajem or Persian farsakh equals 3\u00b782 miles.\n\nThere was a bridge over the Ab-i-Diz between Susa and Jund\u00ed Sh\u00e1p\u00far; its ruins are still to be seen. Persian tradition regarding Jund\u00ed Sh\u00e1p\u00far's origin is as follows: Sh\u00e1p\u00far I. came to Kh\u00fazist\u00e1n with a great army, and encamped somewhere between Sh\u00fashter and Sh\u00fash. His camping place was called Jund-i-Sh\u00e1p\u00far, the army or camp of Sh\u00e1p\u00far. Sh\u00e1p\u00far II. was a prisoner of the Qeisar (Emperor), who always had him led before him when on the march to Kh\u00fazist\u00e1n. At Jund-i-Sh\u00e1p\u00far, the Persian monarch escaped, collected his people, and, after a great battle, took the Qeisar prisoner, and ordered him to send for masons and architects from Constantinople, to rebuild the bridge and other constructions which the Roman army had destroyed. The Qeisar was kept a prisoner till he died, a period of ten years, during which time were built the bridges of Sh\u00fashter, and the various dykes and dams which I shall mention further on. I need hardly say that it was Sh\u00e1p\u00far I. who captured the Roman Emperor Valerian A.D. 260; Sh\u00e1p\u00far II. had wars with Constantius II., Julian, and Jovian, but captured no emperor. Persian history, as usual, is at fault.\n\nThe ruins at Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d are said to be the remains of the Shehr-i-Diagon\u00fas, the town of Diogenes. From Polybius we know (v. 46, 48, 54; x. 29, 30) that a Diogenes was a governor (praefectus) of Susiana during the reign of Antiochus the Great. This Shehr-i-Diagon\u00fas was most probably one of his foundations, or perhaps only a fortified camp. When the rebels under Molo attacked Susa, Diogenes defended the arx; the rebellion was put down, Molo com-\nmitted suicide, and Diogenes was made commander-in-chief of the military forces in Media.\n\nAbout half-way between G\u00e1wnek and Sh\u00fashter are several old canals which came from the Kuran river above Sh\u00fashter. The place where the waters of these canals were led by lateral channels into different parts of the plain is now called Jubband\u00ed. These canals had their water from the large canal cut at G\u00f3twend, at a right angle to the river. The canals are now partly filled up, and only occasionally, when in early spring the Kuran river rises very high, have any water. The many mounds to be seen here show the district to have been very populous. With the decline of Jundi Sh\u00e1pur, in the thirteenth century, the canals were neglected, and the inhabitants of the plain deserted their villages.\n\nThe water-system of Sh\u00fashter and neighbourhood was long a matter of doubt. Sir Henry Rawlinson was, I believe, the first to explain it correctly. As, in a matter of importance, one report more may be useful, I herewith give the result of my own observations, aided by the traditions I heard from the Persians.\n\nArdeshir B\u00e1bek\u00e1n is said to have built the first dam across the river so as to raise the water and get it up to the level of the town. He also cut the D\u00e1ri\u00e1n canal, which led the water into the town and into the fields beyond. The dam then got destroyed, and Sh\u00fashter was without water till the workmen sent for by Valerian renewed it. Thus far the Persian tradition. Ardeshir B\u00e1bek\u00e1n having built a dam at Sh\u00fashter seems to be improbable. His short reign and his wars with the Ashkanians would hardly have given him sufficient time. But the canal, as its name indicates, may have been one of the works of Darius, the name D\u00e1ri\u00e1n being a contraction of D\u00e1r\u00e1bi\u00e1n. The river running west of the town, and having its bed in soft alluvial soil, probably got lower and lower every day, till at last, by not filling the D\u00e1ri\u00e1n canal, it left the town and its southern fields dry. The Persians then got Roman workmen to aid them. A deep canal was dug on the east side of the town, and the river was diverted from the west to the east. Following the\nincline of the alluvial plain, this new river or canal, the present Gerger, was cut towards the bed of the old river at the present Band-i-Qir. The old river was then entirely emptied by constructing a temporary dam across it just at the fork where the new river had been cut. The bed of the old river was then raised several yards, but to prevent any washing away of soil, and a consequent fall of the river, the whole bed was paved with huge stones well jointed by lead. This pavement is called Sh\u00e1durv\u00e1n. A dam was then also built across the new river so as to raise the water on to the Sh\u00e1durv\u00e1n, the temporary dam was removed, and the water, or a part of it, returned to its old bed, forming, as at the present day, a waterfall when it gets to the end of the paved and raised way, the Sh\u00e1durv\u00e1n. The D\u00e1ri\u00e1n canal became also filled, and the town and the country lying south of it were well watered. Later on, the flow of water was regulated by dykes or small tunnel-like openings in the dam over the new river in such a manner that two-sixths of the water flowed east, four-sixths west of the town. This gave rise to the appellations D\u00f3 D\u00e1nk and Chah\u00e1r D\u00e1nk. The Gerger dam occasionally got damaged, and once in the latter part of the last century nearly all the water rushed through the Gerger canal and the D\u00e1ri\u00e1n became perfectly empty; the dam was then reconstructed. The present bridge over the Gerger built on the dam is a modern construction. The bridge over the Shuteit, partly destroyed in 1832, and repaired by Mu\u1e25ammed 'Ali M\u00edrz\u00e1 some years later, is built on the foundations of the old bridge. The very old bridge was destroyed by \u1e24ej\u00e1j-ibn-Y\u00fasuf during the reign of 'Abd-ul-Malek-ibn-Merv\u00e1n (684\u2013705).\n\nA little distance higher up the river are traces of an old bridge, and some ruins called Qala'hi-Dukhtar, and Qala'hi Rustam. They were probably on the direct road between Jundi Sh\u00e1pur and 'Idej, leaving Sh\u00fashter on the right. At Band-i-Dukhtar, six miles higher up, are ruins of a dyke, and a canal which goes towards J\u00fabbandi.\n\nRegarding the older appellations of the rivers there is a great deal of confusion. There is no doubt of the Do D\u00e1nk\nof T\u00edm\u00far's time having been the present Gerger, and the Chah\u00e1r D\u00e1nk the present Shuteit. The origin of the word Gerger is doubtful; it may be a word imitating the sound of the waters gurgling through the tunnels of the dam. The author of the Tohfet-ul-'A\u00e1lem says that some people from the village Gerger in Azerb\u00e1ij\u00e1n came and settled at Sh\u00fashter, and that the quarter of the town which they inhabited became called Gerger, and hence the name of the river. The name Shuteit is modern, and points to an increase or overflowing of the river, perhaps when, after repairing the Gerger dam at the end of the last century, the water of the old arm increased. We have another name, used sometimes for one branch, sometimes for another, viz. Mashreq\u00e1n. This name would indicate the eastern branch, the Gerger; many authors say that the Mashreq\u00e1n was the western branch\u2014thus the old river. \u00c1hmed T\u00fasi makes the matter quite conclusive by saying that the Sh\u00e1durv\u00e1n (which we know to be in the western branch) was in the Mashreq\u00e1n river. Edrisi, after saying that the Mashreq\u00e1n river was westward of the town, speaks of a Mashreq\u00e1n district with many date palms being passed before getting to 'Asker Mukrem. At 'Asker Mukrem was a bridge of twenty boats over the river, and ships went from here to Ahw\u00e1z, eight farsakhs distant. The Nuzhet-ul-Qul\u00e1b says distinctly that 'Asker Mukrem was built on the D\u00f3 D\u00e1nk river, and that it was first called Leshker; the geographical position of 'Asker Mukrem is given as five minutes of longitude east of Sh\u00fashter, thus on the Gerger. Putting these statements together, we get 'Asker Mukrem on the D\u00f3 D\u00e1nk; Gerger and D\u00f3 D\u00e1nk being different names of the same river, the eastern branch, and Mashreq\u00e1n being a name given to both branches indifferently. Mashreq\u00e1n being a large and populous district, lying between and on both branches, it is natural to suppose that the rivers would be called 'Ab-i-Mashreq\u00e1n, simply because they came from Mashreq\u00e1n, or because Mashreq\u00e1n was situated on them, just as at the present day the Gerger and Shuteit are indiscriminately called 'Ab-i-Sh\u00fashter because they come from a pass by that town. The statements\nof the Nuzhet-ul-Qulub (in another place) that one-third of the Shushter water went west and two-thirds east of the town, and of the Jehan-Nama that the Do Dakh ran west, the Chahar Dakh east, must be errors. Such errors seem to be easily made; an English traveller, two or three years ago, made a sketch-map of Shushter and its rivers, and placed the town on the right bank of the Shuteit.\n\nSomewhat above Band-i-Qir, on the Gerger, are some extensive ruins, mounds with bricks and pottery, which I would identify as the site of 'Asker Mukrem. The distance thence to Ahwaz is twenty-six miles, a little over eight and a quarter 'Arab farsakhs. The southern gate of Shushter is still called the Laashker gate.\n\nBand-i-Qir was a dyke, whose stones were fastened together by bitumen, ghr. The 'Arabs told me that when the river was low, boys occasionally dived to the bottom, and picked up stones and bricks with bitumen attached to them. The dyke here raised the water of the Gerger for irrigating the country south of Band-i-Qir as far as Weis.\n\nInto the almost perpendicular sides of the sandstone hills north-east of Shushter, and on the left side of the river, are cut many chambers and niches, guebre dakhmehs, and on the flat hill-tops we see here and there platforms, six feet by four, which were used as places for washing the dead. Each platform has a deeper part in its centre for collecting the water, and a groove from the centre of the platform towards the slope of the hill served as a gutter to lead it off. Some of the chambers have two or three niches in them; some chambers had an arrangement for letting off water like the platforms described, but smaller. The central deeper part of the one I measured was three inches deep, fifteen inches long, and nine inches wide. The entrances to the dakhmehs are very small, some are only thirty-two inches high and twenty-one inches wide. Of many chambers the front walls, being of soft sandstone, and cut rather thin, had fallen down. On the front wall of a chamber, close to the entrance hole, I noticed the Pehlevi inscription 2105.\nHere and there amongst the hills are ruins of platforms built of stone, and remains of steps leading up to them.\n\nThe S\u00e1l\u00e1sil castle of Sh\u00fashter was built, according to the Tohfet-ul-'\u00c1\u00e1lem, by a slave S\u00e1l\u00e1sil; according to the Tar\u00edkh-i-'Azadi, by N\u00far-Ullah-ibn-Sheriff. A probable connexion between the \u03a3\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd of Ptolemy and Ammianus Marcellinus, who mention it as one of the four great towns of Susiana, has already, many years ago, been pointed out.\n\nThe old dams and aqueducts from Band-i-Q\u00edr to Ahw\u00e1z, and the great dyke at Ahw\u00e1z, and the ruins there, have been often enough described. The canals south of Ahw\u00e1z are modern. A canal went from Sam\u00e1 'Ain\u00e9h or Ism'a\u00edl\u00e9h south-east to Dor\u00e1k; it is now filled up. The Salm\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e9h canal took the Kar\u00fan water to Fellah\u00edeh, the M\u00e1red canal (from Sidd-i-Sol\u00edm\u00e1n) went to Qob\u00e1n. When Qob\u00e1n got ruined, and Fellah\u00edeh began to prosper, the Salm\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e9h canal was dug. A branch was also dug from the M\u00e1red canal to Fellah\u00edeh. The M\u00e1red canal and the mounds of the old dyke are generally called Sableh; Sableh, however, was pointed out to me as a village lying opposite, on the right side of the Kar\u00fan, and from Sableh a canal goes towards the north of Muhamreh. The M\u00e1red canal has water at high tide as far as Fellah\u00edeh; the Salm\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e9h and Ism'a\u00edl\u00e9h canals are filled up with sand.\n\nFrom Mor\u00e1n due south to the M\u00e1red canal is a line of mounds; the mounds are not high, but are high enough to serve as landmarks in the desert. They contain many bricks and pieces of pottery, and were, perhaps, watch-towers on the old high road to the south.\n\nThe tree most commonly met with on the banks of the rivers of Susiana, as well as of Babylonia (vide Ainsworth's Researches, London, 1858, p. 125), is the gharab. This is a tree half poplar, half willow, having lanceolate and cordate leaves on the same branches. There is no doubt of this tree being the Hebrew \u05db\u05b7\u05bc\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05e2 of Scripture,\u00b9 the true Salix Baby-\n\n\u00b9 Leviticus xxiii. 40; Job xl. 22; Psalms cxxxvii. 2; Isaiah xv. 7; xlii. 4. The Chaldean and Syriac versions have the same word.\nlonica. The Hebrew word, pointing to something mixed or mingled, applies to the different forms of the leaves, not as Parkhurst, in his Lexicon, says, to different colours of the leaves. The tree which we know as the Salix Babylonica, the weeping willow, is not found in Babylonia and Susiana. The names weeping willow, saule pleureur, etc., are evidently derived from a meaning of the word gharab, 'a tear.' Persians call the gharab a willow; the true willow is called by the Arabs Sif\u00e1f; our weeping willow is the Persian B\u00edd-i-majn\u00fan.\n\nFrom Sh\u00fashter to Ispah\u00e1n I took the road of which Ibn Batuta has given an itinerary. The first traces of the old road were at Pul-i-burid\u00e9h on the Tund\u00e1b, running towards R\u00e1m Hormuz. B\u00e1gh-i-Malek is the old Manjeniq. Hel\u00e1iq\u00e1n is Ibn Batuta's Hel\u00e1kh\u00e1n. M\u00e1l\u00e1m\u00edr is the old 'Idej or Izej. A little before Hel\u00e1iq\u00e1n, in the Qals'h-i-Tul plain, is a little village inhabited by the Ushk\u00fahi or Ushk\u00fai (the long \u00fa pronounced like the German \u00fc or ue) tribe, a name wonderfully like \u00d3\u03be\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 or Uxii. On the Sar-i-R\u00e1k mountain, beyond M\u00e1l\u00e1m\u00edr, are several miles of the old paved way, here called R\u00e1h-i-Sult\u00e1n\u00ed. Qala'h-i-Medresseh is one of the many caravanserais spoken of by Ibn Batuta as built by the Fazlv\u00edeh At\u00e1begs of Great Lur\u00edst\u00e1n. Beyond it are the ruins of the old bridge over the Kuran river. From the Kuh-i-Saf\u00edd down to the B\u00e1zuft river is a steep descent of 2046 feet; traces of the old road are to be seen on the descent, and ruins of a bridge that went over the river lie a few yards above the present Pul-i-'am\u00e1ret, which by-the-bye consists only of the simple trunk of an oak. At Dopol\u00fan are the ruins of two old bridges. In the Ardal pass are parts of the old paved way. In the S\u00falej\u00e1n plain an old viaduct. The last point of Ibn Batuta's route which I have been able to identify by name is the Qahv-i-Rukh pass, Ibn Batuta's Ger\u00edveh-ur-Rukh. Ibn Batuta's Ushtur-k\u00e1n, Fir\u00faz\u00e1n, two towns, and Nobl\u00e1n, a village, I have not been able to find.\n\nOn the road from Ispah\u00e1n to Bur\u00fajird I passed through the province of Fer\u00eddan; its capital is Dar\u00fan, a village with\n300 families. In the village Akhor\u00e1 are some Georgian speaking families. The town P\u00faash\u00edsh of the maps never was a town. It lies beyond the Parsi\u00e1ht mountain, and is at present a small deserted village, called Parsi\u00e1ht. There are also a small ruin called Sh\u00e1h nish\u00edn, and the grave of a nameless saint. Further north I passed a river called Kerj; it helped to identify the site of the old town Kerj as being in the neighbourhood of, or perhaps at, Gulp\u00e1ig\u00e1n. Kerj, according to the Muajem-ul-Buld\u00e1n, was founded during the reign of Har\u00fan-ur-Rashid, and according to the Nuzhet-ul-Qul\u00fab was forty-five farsakhs from Ispah\u00e1n, and thirty-five from Keng\u00e1wer.\n\nMy maps of the above-mentioned roads are in the hands of Professor Kiepert, of Berlin, for publication.\nART. XII.\u2014Identification of the \"False Dawn\" of the Muslims with the \"Zodiacal Light\" of Europeans. By J. W. Redhouse, M.R.A.S., Hon. Memb. R.S.L.\n\nIn a paper read before the Royal Asiatic Society in the spring of 1877, and printed in the tenth volume, new series (p. 344), of its Journal, a suggestion was made that the natural phenomenon known to Muslims of every clime as the \"False Dawn\" was no other than what is known in Europe by the name of \"The Zodiacal Light.\"\n\nThrough the liberality of the Society's rule by which a certain number of copies are furnished to the writers of papers printed in its Journal, this subject was brought to the notice of several of our most talented astronomers, in the hope that they might adopt a method of authoritatively settling the question, which is not only interesting to Orientalists as one of lexicology, but also to the astronomical world as involving a point in the archaeology of their special science.\n\nAll our Oriental dictionaries content themselves with the mere verbal translation of the Eastern expression \"false dawn,\" and astronomical treatises teach Europeans that the \"zodiacal light\" was first observed about the beginning of the seventeenth century of the Christian era, and named by Cassini in 1683.\n\nWhen the former paper was read to the Society, an idea was offered that the identification of the \"false dawn\" with the \"zodiacal light\" was well known. Still, the lexicons are, to this day, silent on the subject.\n\nTo test that matter to the utmost, I wrote at once to the accomplished Secretary of the Asiatic Society of Paris a letter, requesting him, if permissible, to put the two follow-\ning questions to that learned body: \"What is the European name of the phenomenon called 'false dawn' and 'wolf's tail'?\" and \"Is any author known who has given the Western equivalent to those Eastern names?\"\n\nThe following is the answer, in its original English, received from that gentleman:\n\n\"Paris, 19, Rue Mazarine, May 27, 1877.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014The letter which you were kind enough to address to the Council of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique has been communicated in its last sitting, and I have been entrusted with the honourable duty to reply to you. I consulted an experienced Oriental scholar, M. d'Abbadie, of the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, and he answered that the 'wolf's tail' must be the Zodiacaal Light, which appears in the form of a tail or a cue. Believe me, etc.,\n\nJ. Oppert, etc.\"\n\nTo a somewhat similar communication, accompanying a copy of my paper, to the Astronomer Royal, an answer was returned, of which the following paragraph is selected:\n\n\"Royal Observatory, October 17, 1878.\n\n\"I do not doubt the correctness of your identification of the appearance of which you speak with the zodiacal light, and shall be glad to aid in its observation. Professor C. P. Smyth of Edinburgh has given attention to the zodiacal light, as seen in favourable latitudes. The appearance which you describe is known in poetry, e.g. Moore's Light of the Harem\u2014\n\n'Tis dawn, at least that earlier dawn,\nWhose glimpses are again withdrawn.'\n\nThis answer did not meet my suggestion, since repeated in various directions, that some European well acquainted with the Zodiacaal light should be brought together, in India or elsewhere, with a Muslim of experience and learning, thoroughly acquainted with the \"false dawn,\" some morning early, when this phenomenon is there visible; this being the only satisfactory method by which the question could be definitely set at rest.\nIn answer to a letter, with a copy of my paper, Professor Piazzi Smyth was so obliging as to write as follows:\n\n\"Edinburgh, 19th Oct., 1878.\n\n\"Your conclusion as to the Muslim idea of a false dawn\u2014in shape like a wolf's tail, and pointing more or less upwards\u2014in contrast with the true dawn spreading afterwards horizontally\u2014being the zodiacal light, is, I believe, perfectly correct\u2014almost necessarily correct. For the names and descriptions of either phenomenon describe them so well and simply, that I have sometimes used almost the same words myself, when telling of what I had seen, eastward before sunrise, and westward after sunset. In the former case, when getting up at certain seasons early in the morning hours, in latitudes 28\u00b0 and 35\u00b0, and gazing on the eastern starlit skies, the false dawn of the zodiacal light was so excessively conspicuous for hours before the true dawn appeared, that I wondered exceedingly at the phenomenon not having excited more astronomical interest. I am therefore not at all astonished to hear from you now that Muslims, inhabiting so generally the brilliant lands of the date-palm and water-melon, and having their wits sharpened by self-interest, did early come to perceive, and make practical use of their observational discovery that the zodiacal light, though appearing as a faint blush of light in the east before sunrise, is a perfectly different thing from, and a much earlier phenomenon than, the true dawn of day.\"\n\nProfessor Adams, of Cambridge, answered me as follows:\n\n\"24th Oct., 1878.\n\n\"I think there can be no doubt that you are right in considering that the zodiacal light is meant by the designation of the 'False Dawn.' Lalande mentions that Cassini had no doubt that the zodiacal light had been observed before, although it had not been described and expressly referred to in ancient authors.\"\n\nProfessor Max M\u00fcller had naturally compared ancient Greek and Sanskrit myths relating to the dawn; but of the false dawn what he said was the following:\nOXFORD, 22nd October, 1878.\n\n\"I do not know whether the false dawn is scientifically called zodiacal light, and I doubt whether India is the place to observe it, as I believe in India proper there is little of dawn, still less of twilight.\"\n\nUp to the date of these answers, and for some months later, I only knew that the \"false dawn\" and the \"true dawn\" had been distinguished for centuries past by the legists and poets of Isl\u0101m. It was in the early part of 1879 that I became aware, quite by chance, and while pursuing a totally different inquiry, that Muhammad had himself legislated upon the subject in the Qur\u02be\u0101n itself (ch. ii. v. 183). This discovery at once suggested the probability that the phenomenon of the false dawn had been known for ages before the promulgation of Isl\u0101m, in those latitudes.\n\nAmong those to whom I sent copies of my paper was the Rev. T. V. A. Van Dyck, Professor of Astronomy at the American Missionary College of Beyr\u016bt, and also H. H. Midhat Pasha, Governor-General of Syria.\n\nDr. Van Dyck wrote in reply:\n\n\"Beyr\u016bt, March 17th, 1879.\n\n\"I have no doubt of the correctness of your view; but it is difficult to settle the point absolutely. From Beyr\u016bt the zodiacal light is not distinct in the morning. Aleppo, Hama, Hums, Damascus, Jerusalem, are all good places to look for it. I have tried to find there some one who knew and can recognize the zodiacal light, who would go to the minaret with a Mu\u02beeddin when he sees the false dawn; but I can find no one. . . . All I have collected from thence goes to confirm your view; but I cannot get the thing put through, so as to have a Muslim say: 'There is the false dawn,' and an astronomer, one who knows, say: 'That is the zodiacal light.'\"\n\nH. H. Midhat Pasha's answer was, in substance, as follows:\n\n\"April 14, 1879.\n\n\"The Mufti of Damascus sends you the inclosed paper on the question of the false dawn and the zodiacal light: [Trans-\nThe false dawn is what Europeans style the zodiacal light. It is the reflexion of the sun's rays in the sphere of vapour; it is narrow and tall. As the sun comes nearer to the eastern horizon in the morning, its light spreads along the horizon; this is the true dawn. A similar appearance is visible in the evening in the west, when the sun is as far below the horizon there as it was in the morning, when the false and true dawns appeared respectively. We call the western analogue of the true dawn the red and the white evening twilight, at its beginning and end; and that of the false dawn we designate as the tall evening twilight. This also is called zodiacal light by Europeans.\n\nNo European had hitherto expressly and publicly identified the \"false dawn\" of the Arabians with the zodiacal light. Yet here we have proof that a Muslim legist of Damascus had made himself acquainted with the two terms and their identity of meaning.\n\nA letter was next received from our most obliging fellow-Member of the Society, E. T. Rogers, Esq., residing at Cairo:\n\n\"Cairo, August 17, 1879.\n\n\"To-day I consulted a very intelligent astronomer. He said that the term 'false dawn' was not the right name for it; it should be called the 'zodiacal light.' He sketched the shape of it exactly as you have shown it. Thus a scientific astronomer in Cairo, without knowing the object of my questions, entirely confirms your theory that the 'false dawn' and the 'zodiacal light' are one and the same thing.\"\n\nHere again is an instance of an Oriental being already aware that the \"false dawn\" is the \"zodiacal light.\"\n\nDr. Kirk, Her Majesty's Agent and Consul-General at Zanzibar, also sent me an answer, as follows:\n\n\"Zanzibar, October 9, 1879.\n\n\"I have made all endeavours to settle the question raised as to the 'false dawn.' I found that Seyyid Bargash, the Sultan, knew more of the thing than any one else here, and got him to tell me exactly where and when to notice it. In\nthese climates it is a thing known at all seasons, when the moon is below the horizon. This was so at the time your letter reached, and I soon had a good chance of observing the phenomenon. The zodiacal light is a thing I knew very well, and on which I had often made notes; but it is strange to say I never noticed it in the morning, and was not aware it was ever then seen. Still, I knew the light well, and had nothing to learn as to its general appearance. When I watched the light known as the 'false dawn,' it seemed to me very like the zodiacal light of the evening, rising in the east in a cone, and inclined considerably to the north. It was not so distinct as to allow me to measure its apex; but, from what I saw, there is little doubt in identifying it with the zodiacal light. There was no fading of this light as the true dawn spread over the horizon; but it became lost in the general rising light. Seyyid Bargash wished me to read up some theological books on the subject; but I need not trouble you on that score.\"\n\nI have recently had doubts expressed to me as to the possibility of the false dawn's having been long known to the legists and poets of Islam, because no mention has been found, by my correspondent, of this phenomenon in the works of the great Arabian astronomers. I am not myself able to refer to an Arabian astronomer on the subject; neither is this light mentioned in the \"Dictionary of the Technical Terms used in the Sciences of the Musalmans.\" But, besides the passage of the Qur'an formerly mentioned, of which the date is about A.D. 630, the Arabian dictionary, the Sihuh, by El Jawhari, who died in A.D. 1006, says: \"the dark streak of dawn is the 'false dawn,' and the light streak is the 'true dawn.'\" The expressions \"dark streak\" and \"light streak\" are those used in the passage cited from the Qur'an; and the great commentary of El Baydhawi, who died about A.D. 1320, says in treating of that text: \"Here a comparison is made between what first appears of the dawn in the horizon together with the blackness of night's darkness, and two threads (or streaks) one black, one white.\"\nThese quotations show how much and how early attention the phenomena of dawn had excited in Isl\u0101m.\n\nThe only direct and decisive proof I have received, up to the present time, of the accuracy of all these inductions and assertions, is contained in the following letter, received through the kind co-operation of the talented Hydrographer to the Admiralty, from the commanding officer of Her Majesty's man-of-war steamer Fawn:\n\n\"TUZLA BAY, September 26, 1879.\n\n\"Dear Capt. Evans,\u2014For the information of Mr. Redhouse, I have to tell you that I can satisfactorily answer his question as to the false dawn of the Turks. On the morning of 20th inst., at 3:30 A.M., I went to a mosque at Biyukdera, and interviewed the Im\u0101m, who, on being asked for the 'fejri ky\u0101zib (false dawn),' at once pointed out the zodiacal light, then brightly shining in the east. . . . There can be no doubt as to the coincidence of the two. Yours sincerely,\n\n\"W. J. L. Wharton.\"\n\nTaking, now, for granted that the \"false dawn\" is the zodiacal light, as I shall unhesitatingly state in any philological work I may in future write, what follows? To my mind, two things follow directly thence, one of which is of high ethnographical importance.\n\nIn the first place, it becomes evident that, though the zodiacal light is a very recently-discovered phenomenon for European astronomers, a knowledge of its appearance has been possessed by the inhabitants of South-western Asia, if by no others, in the centuries elapsed between the promulgation of the Gospel and the Qur'\u0101n respectively; and, as there is no reason to limit such knowledge to those times, in relation to a phenomenon almost as patent to nomads, shepherds, travellers, and marching armies, in those latitudes, as the milky way, we may almost confidently venture to entertain a belief that it has been universally known there from very early days. This fact calls for notice in all future historical disquisitions on the zodiacal light.\n\nIn the second place, since it is an admitted fact that the\nzodiacal light was totally unknown among Europeans of any class until about two centuries ago, it is clear that their forefathers never could have come from that central point of Asia so dear to modern Sanskritists, from whence they would fain make the Aryan race to radiate, that is, from the snowy table-land of Pamir. The zodiacal light must be as well known to the shepherds of that plateau (lat. 36\u00b0 to 38\u00b0 N.) as it is to the nomads of Arabia and Mesopotamia. It must always have been well known to them; and once known to a people, such a phenomenon could never be totally forgotten in latitudes where it was visible. Our Aryan race came not, then, from Pamir as their radiating centre. Ethnologists may well weigh this pregnant indication.\n\nLondon, February 16, 1880.\nART. XIII.\u2014The Gaurian compared with the Romance Languages. Part II. By Mr. E. L. Brandreth.\n\nIn Part I. published in the preceding Volume, XI. page 287, I compared, principally, the phonology of the two groups. I now proceed to compare some of the other parts of their grammar. Since Part I. was written, the third volume of Mr. Beames's Grammar has appeared, which gives a very complete account of the Gaurian verb, and also by the kindness of Professor Hoernle the proof-sheets of a great part of his Grammar of the Eastern Hindi have been sent me. This work is also a comparative grammar of the Gaurian languages in general. It is, it seems to me, a most valuable work, and throws a great deal of new light on the origin of many of the grammatical forms. Professor Hoernle now calls the languages treated of 'Gaudian' instead of 'Gaurian,' as we have 'Dravidian' instead of 'Dravirian.'\n\nWith regard to the gender of nouns, the Skr. and Lat. had three genders, the masc. fem. and neut. In S. P. and G. among the Gaurian languages there are only two genders, the masc. and fem. G. and M. retain all three genders of the Skr., while the two Eastern languages B. and O. have lost all distinction of gender. In Romance also there only are two genders, masc. and fem., except in Sp., where an adjective expressing an abstract idea and used substantively has the neut. gender.\n\nAs a rule, the subst. in all the gender languages retain\n\n1 For the abbreviations see Part I. p. 288.\nthe gender which they had in Skr. or Lat., and the neut. becomes masc. in S. P. and H., and in Romance. To some extent the gender may be gathered from the termination of subst. Thus, generally, u in S., and o in S. and G., together with the corresponding a of the other Gaurians, denote masc. subst.; a in S., and also i in S. and in Gaurian, generally are fem. in words which do not imply sex. E is generally the sign of the neuter in M., j in G. So also in Romance subst. which terminate in o are usually masc. and those which terminate in a (French mute e) fem.\n\nThere are, however, several exceptions to the rule that the subst. in both modern groups retain the ancient gender. The most remarkable of the exceptions in Gaurian is that of several subst. in i. I has become typical of the fem. gender in Gaurian, and marks the fem. of adj., as it also did of several adj. in Skr., though a was the usual fem. ending in Skr. I, derived from the Skr. fem. suffix ika, the use of which was greatly extended in Prakrit, where it became ia or M\u016bgadhi ie, is the termination of many subst. in Gaurian. A preponderating number of fem. subst. in i being thus created, several subst. ending in i in Gaurian, of a different origin, which were masc. or neut. in Skr., have become, by the attraction of the larger mass, fem. in Gaurian; as Skr. vikrayas m. 'sale,' S. vikiri f. H. bikri; Skr. cauryam n. 'theft,' S. and H. kori f. A part similar to that played by i in making fem. subst. in Gaurian has been played by o in regard to masc. subst. in Romance. Fem. of the 2nd Lat. declension, and of the 4th which is merged in the 2nd, have become masc. in Romance; as Lat. porticus, It. portico, Fr. porche, etc.; the only exception being manus, It. mano, Fr. main, which has preserved its original gender. Many subst., again, have been adopted into both groups from other languages, and had to be fitted with genders as best they could. A great number of words from the Persian, which is genderless, have been adopted into Gaurian. The gender of such words has been settled to some extent by their terminations. In Romance most words received from the German have retained their gender, neut. becoming masc.\nIn Skr. there are often two forms of the same word, the second having a diminutive or pleonastic suffix, from which last the modern word is derived; as has been proved by Hoernle; thus Skr. sy\u0101las and sy\u0101lakas \u2018wife\u2019s brother,\u2019 S. s\u0101lo, H. s\u0101l\u0101; Skr. kitas and kitakas \u2018a worm,\u2019 S. kiro, H. kir\u0101; Skr. kshuri and kshurik\u0101 \u2018a knife,\u2019 S. and H. churi. This ka suffix is extended also to subst. which did not have it in Skr.; as bhed\u012b \u2018a ewe,\u2019 H. bheri; Skr. skandhas \u2018the shoulder,\u2019 S. kandho, H. k\u0101tha; and still more frequently to adj., as Skr. gauras, i, \u2018pale,\u2019 S. goro, i, H. gor\u0101, i; Skr. k\u0101nas, \u0101, \u2018one-eyed,\u2019 S. kano, i, H. k\u0101n\u0101, i. If these words had been derived from Skr. primary forms, they would have ended either in a consonant or in a short vowel. B. and O., as the rule, do not add the suffix to the adj. The diminutive suffixes are great favourites in the same way in the other group; as Lat. frater and fraterculus, It. fratello; Lat. apis and apicula, Fr. abeille; Lat. anulus and anellus or annellus, It. anello, Fr. anneau; and new formations, as It. avolo, seggiola, Fr. soleil, sommeil, and adj., as It. parecchio, Fr. pareil.\n\nIn the Indian group it is to the nom. of the Skr. that the form of the modern subst. is, in most instances, to be referred. Subst. however, belonging to the class of Skr. consonant subst. are sometimes derived from the same stem as that of the acc., and not from the nom., where there is a difference. Thus, subst. of this class admit to some extent of a special comparison with the acc. formations of the Romance. There are, also, subst. in both groups, and especially in Fr. among the Romance languages, in which the whole final syllable has been lost, an entirely new form being thus given to the subst. Of the five Lat. declensions, the traces of three, namely, the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, are more or less preserved in the derived languages, and it is, as the rule, from the Lat. acc. that the modern subst. is said to be derived; but in It. the nom. has had more influence than in the other languages. In both groups the final s or m of the nom. or acc. sing. form disappears; except that in Old Fr. and Prov., where there is both a nom. and an oblique form, the s is retained in the\nnom. form. The stem vowels are always retained in S., dropped, generally, in the other Gaurian languages, though i and u are occasionally retained. U = Skr. a, however, is preserved in old H. and in some of the dialects. In Romance the stem vowel is, generally, dropped in Fr. and Prov., retained in the other languages. The a, however, of the 1st Lat. decl. is preserved in Prov., while in Fr. it becomes mute e. The dual of the Skr. has disappeared in Gaurian, as it had previously done in Prakrit.\n\nThe plural of subst. in both groups is still formed to a considerable extent by flexion. Thus, in S. masc. subst. in u have a in the pl. form; fem. in a, \u0101 or \u016b; masc. in o, \u0101; fem. in i, u and i, \u016b, \u016b and iy\u016b. In H. masc. in a have e; fem. ending in a cons. \u0113; fem. in i and \u016b, iy\u0101 and u\u0101. In P. masc. in \u0101 have e; fem. ending in a cons. \u012b; fem. in i and \u016b, \u012bd and u\u0101. In G. masc. in o have \u0101o; neut. in \u016b, \u0101o; all other subst. add o to the sing. In M. subst. ending in a cons., if fem., have a or i, according as they are derived from Skr. stems in \u0101 or i, if neut., \u0113; masc. in \u0101, e; neut. in \u0113, \u012b; fem. in i, y\u0101; neut. in \u012b, y\u0113; fem. in u, \u016b, r\u0101; neut. in \u016b, r\u0113. In B. the pl. form is in ar\u0101 or er\u0101, restricted to rational beings. The r\u0101 is a modern affix, and not derived from any pl. form of the Skr. In O. the pl. is formed with m\u0101ne for animate, and m\u0101n for inanimate objects. This is a compound form, and the pl. sign is thought by Hoernle to be probably from Skr. m\u0101nava \u2018man.\u2019 There are also compound forms in the other languages in addition to the flexion forms. Thus log \u2018people,\u2019 is often added colloquially in H. to form the pl. of rational beings. The flexion forms are generally considered to be derived from Pr. and Skr. pl.; as, S. masc. u, pl. a from Pr. o, pl. a and Skr. as, pl. as; S. fem. i, pl. \u016b, from Pr. i, pl. io, and Skr. is, pl. ayas. Hoernle, on the other hand, finding that, with the exception of the M. fem. and neut. nouns, the nom. pl. forms of each language are identical with the oblique forms either in the same or some other Gaurian language, says there can be no doubt that these so-called nom. pl. forms are elliptic phrases which must be filled up by supplying some collective noun, as log\n'people,' gan 'troup,' etc. No doubt all the Gaurian pl. cannot clearly be traced to Skr. or Prakrit pl. forms, but I question whether Hoernle's theory will be accepted as a satisfactory solution of the difficulty.\n\nIn It., in the first two declensions, the pl. is derived from the Lat. nom. pl. Subst. of the 1st decl. in a, which are usually fem., have e in the pl.; but if the subst. is masc., it has i. Subst. of the 2nd. decl. in o have i, if the subst. was masc. in Lat., but often a if it was neut. Here, also, as in the case of the fem. and neut. subst. in M. mentioned above, the different flexions, by which these subst. were distinguished in the ancient languages, which are no longer shown in the sing., have been preserved in the pl. In Fr. Sp. and Port. the pl. ends in s derived from the Lat. acc. pl. The accompanying table gives a few examples of the foregoing remarks relating to both groups, showing the subst. both in their sing. and pl. forms, though, as above stated, there is a difference of opinion as to whether or not the pl. flexions in Gaurian are to be referred to the Skr. pl. These examples may be thus classed:\u2014\n\n1. Subst. derived from Skr. and Lat. subst. with vowel stems.\n2. Subst. derived from Skr. and Lat. subst. with consonant stems.\n3. Subst. which have suffered apocope of their original stem suffixes or final syllables.\n\nBesides the nom. forms, the Gaurians have also an oblique form. In S. masc. in u have a in the obl. sing.; masc. in o, e; all subst. in i and u, ia and ua; in the pl. the forms are more numerous, viz. \u0101, \u0113, ani, uni, iani, uani, which are to some extent indiscriminately used with any subst. In H. masc. in \u0101 have e in the obl. sing., \u012b in the obl. pl.; all other subst. have \u012b in the obl. pl. added to the nom. sing. In P. masc. in \u0101 have e in the obl. sing., \u012b\u0101 in the obl. pl.; all other subst. have \u012b\u0101 in the obl. pl. added to the nom. sing. In G. masc. in o and neut. in \u016b have \u0101 in the obl. sing., and there is no obl. form at all in the pl. distinct from the nom. form. In M. masc. and neut. ending in a cons. have \u0101 obl. sing., \u0101 pl., fem., e or i sing., \u0101 or \u012b pl.; masc. in \u0101, neut. \u0113, y\u0101 sing., \u0101 or y\u0101 pl.; masc. in i, neut. \u012b, y\u0101 sing., \u012b or y\u0101 pl.; fem. in i, ye sing., y\u0101 pl.; masc. in u, neut. \u016b, \u0113\u0101 sing.,\n| Stems | Nom. sing. | Nom. pl. | Nom. sing. | Nom. pl. |\n|-------|------------|----------|------------|----------|\n| a = o | Skr. nar-as 'man' | nar-\u0101s | Lat. ann-us | ann-i (ann-es) |\n|       | S. nar-u | nar-a | It. ann-e | ann-i |\n|       | O.H. nar- | nar-a | W. ann-e | ann-i |\n|       | H. nar- | nar- | Fr. ann- | ann-i |\n|       | Skr. g\u1e5bh-am n.

Hoernle, however, is of opinion that the e in e-r gen. sing. and in e-te loc. sing. of subst. in B. is of similar origin to the obl. forms of the other languages above referred to. It is clear, also, that the compound pl. in O. has an obl. form in an; as, for instance, ghar-m\u0101n nom. pl. 'houses'; ghar-m\u0101nan obl. pl.\n\nThe different forms of the obl. in Gaurian are considered by Hoernle to be all derived ultimately from the Skr. genitive suffix sya m. y\u0101s f., pl. n\u0101m m.f., or from the strong form kasya m. k\u0101y\u0101s f., pl. k\u0101n\u0101m m.f., with elision of k in the moderns. To see this we must study all the intermediate forms preserved in the different kinds of Prakrit. It will not be necessary, however, to go into these details for my purpose, as beyond the fact of there being a nom. and obl. form in most of the Gaurian languages and in two of the Romance, and the use to which they are put, there is not much else to compare, in regard to these forms, between the two groups, the obl. in one group being derived from the gen., in the other from the acc. of the parent language. One or two examples of comparison with the Skr. will be sufficient for the Gaurian group; as, Skr. naras 'a man,' gen. sing. narasya, gen. pl. n\u0101r\u0101nam; S. naru, obl. sing. nara, obl. pl. nard; H. nar, obl. pl. nardo; M. nar, obl. sing. narda, obl. pl. narda. Skr. jih\u0113da 'the tongue,' gen. sing. jih\u0113day\u0101s, gen. pl. jih\u0113n\u0101nam; S. jibha, obl. pl. jibh\u0101; H. jibh, obl. pl. jibh\u014d; M. jibh, obl. sing. jibhe, obl. pl. jibh\u0101. Skr. tamrakas 'copper,' gen. sing. tamrakasya, gen. pl. tamrak\u0101nam; S. t\u0101mo, obl. sing. tame, obl. pl. t\u0101ma; H. t\u0101ba, obl. sing. t\u0101be, obl. pl. t\u0101b\u014d. There is, however, in some of the Gaurians, a second form of the obl. which usually takes no postposition, and is restricted generally to the expression of one relation of the subst., which is derived by Hoernle from a different form in Prakrit of the\nSkr. gen. Thus in M. there is the general obl. sing. in \u0101 = Mg. Pr. aha, as n\u0101r\u0101 given above, and there is a special obl. in \u0101s = Pr. asa, which has become the dative, as n\u0101r\u0101s \u2018to a man.\u2019 There are also relics of the old inflected inst. and abl. case in M. and S., and some relics of the old loc. in most of the Gaurians.\n\nIn the Romance languages it is only the Old Fr. and Prov. that have an obl. form distinct from the nom. form. The obl. form is derived from the Lat. acc., and this is the form which the subst. has taken in modern Fr. The two cases are preserved in subst. belonging to the 2nd and 3rd declensions; as Lat. annus, acc. annum, pl. anni, acc. annos; Old Fr. and Prov. ans, acc. an, pl. an, acc. ans; Lat. pastor, acc. pastorem, pl. pastores; Old Fr. pastre, acc. pasteur, pl. pasteurs; Prov. pastre, acc. pastor, pl. pastors. In Old Fr. and Prov., as in Old H., the case particles were not so rigorously employed as in later times; but were often omitted where the relation of the subst. could be gathered from the context.\n\nIn both groups, in their present state, the old relations of case are, generally, expressed by particles, which are directly connected with the subst. governed by them, and in Gaurian with the obl. form of the subst., and which usually follow the subst. in one group, precede it in the other. Several other relations of the subst. are expressed in the same way. These particles are prepositions or postpositions proper. Other relations of the subst., again, are expressed by particles which are connected with the subst. by means of a case particle, usually the gen. particle. These are prepositions or postpositions improper, being of the nature of adverbs, and many of them can be used as such, that is, attached to the verb without affecting the case relation of any subst. The following are instances from H. and Fr., as deo \u2018dieu,\u2019 deo ko \u2018a dieu,\u2019 deo par \u2018sur dieu,\u2019 deo ke pas \u2018pres de dieu.\u2019 The reason of the particles preceding the subst. in one group and following it in the other is that in Lat. there were prepositions, which by a slight change and extension of their meaning, though they have also preserved their ancient\nprepositional force, were ready to take the place of the case flexions. In the late Lat. of the inscriptions, where the cases were in a state of confusion, they are found exercising this function. The prepositions principally used for this purpose in the modern languages are *de* and *ad*, and in It. a compound preposition *da* composed of *de* and *ad*. *In*, *cum*, *per* and *pro* are also occasionally employed to express some of the old relations of case. On the other hand, in Skr. the prepositions do not appear to have been so well fitted by previous use and meaning to the required purpose. It was necessary therefore to have recourse elsewhere for case particles to take the place of the lost cases, and accordingly subst. in the Skr. locative case were often made use of to this end. The usual position of subst. in an Aryan language is after the subst. dependent on them; hence they became postpositions. Prepositions in Skr., however, frequently follow the subst. which is governed by them.\n\nOf the case particles employed in Gaurian, the dat. particles, S. *khe*, H. *kho*, are probably derived from the Skr. loc. *kakshe* \u2018at the side.\u2019 The loc. particle S. and H. *m\u0113* is unquestionably derived from the Skr. loc. *madhye* \u2018in the midst.\u2019 About the origin of the abl. and instr. particles in S. *kh\u0101*, H. *se*, there appears to be much doubt. The particle which marks the gen. relation is distinguished from the others in that, in the gender languages, it is inflected like an adj., in fact by it the subst. in the gen. relation is made into an adj. which agrees in number, gender, and case with the subst. on which it depends; as S. *piu jo puttu*, H. *b\u0101p k\u0101 bet\u0101* \u2018father\u2019s son\u2019; S. *piu ji dhia*, H. *b\u0101p ki bet\u012b* \u2018father\u2019s daughter.\u2019 The H. *k\u0101*, *ki*, *ke*, is in all probability derived from the Skr. past part. *krita* \u2018made,\u2019 Pr. *kera*, while the S. *jo*, *ji*, *je*, and the P. *da*, *di*, *de*, are considered by Hoernle to be identical with the H. past part. *diy\u0101* \u2018given.\u2019 The case particles differ to a considerable extent in the different languages, and are not all of a common origin, but each language sometimes provided for them, independently of the others, out of its own resources.\n\nBesides the case particles, to the class of prepositions or\npostpositions proper belong in the Romance group most of the old prepositions and compounds of prepositions, and also some particles formed from subst. and adj. In the Gaurian group this class is not so numerous as in the Romance, and consists principally of particles formed from subst. and adj., sometimes of the old prepositions. A few instances of this class in both groups are as follows: S. lai \u2018for\u2019 (Skr. labdha \u2018obtained\u2019), Fr. pour; S. adru \u2018according to\u2019 (Skr. sad\u1e5b\u015ba \u2018like\u2019), Fr. selon; S. pari, H. par \u2018upon\u2019 (Skr. upari), It. sopra, Fr. sur; S. re \u2018without\u2019 (Skr. rite), It. senza; S. sa Skr. sam), H. samet \u2018with,\u2019 Fr. avec, It. con; S. d\u00e0 \u2018towards,\u2019 Fr. vers; H. p\u00e2r, Skr. p\u0101re loc. \u2018at the further side\u2019), Fr. outre; S. bhari \u2018against\u2019 (Skr. bhara \u2018supporting\u2019), Fr. contre.\n\nThe other class, that of the prepositions or postpositions improper, is very numerous in Gaurian. The particles of this class are mostly derived from subst., in both groups. Some, however, that were prepositions in the ancient languages also require a case particle to connect them with the subst. The following are a few instances of this class of particles in Gaurian with their equivalents in Romance: S. kh\u00e2 age, H. ke \u00e2ge (Skr. loc. agre \u2018in front\u2019), It. davanti a, Fr. au devant de; S. je p\u00e2se, It. ke p\u00e2s (Skr. p\u00e2stre loc. \u2018at the side\u2019), It. presso di, Fr. pr\u00e8s de; S. je vic\u00e8, H. ke bi\u0107 (Skr. vrit \u2018be,\u2019 \u2018dwell\u2019), It. in mezzo di, Fr. au milieu de; Skr. kh\u00e2 poe, H. ke p\u00e2che (Skr. adj. loc. pa\u015bce), It. dietro a; S. hethe, H. ni\u0107e (Skr. adj. loc. ni\u0107e), It. sotto a, Fr. au dessous de; S. je b\u00e2hari, H. ke b\u00e2hir (Skr. bahis), It. fuore di, Fr. hors de.\n\nSeveral prepositions and postpositions do not absolutely belong to either of the above classes, but may be used in both classes, sometimes in the same, sometimes in different languages. The postpositions so called in Gaurian do not, however, always follow the subst. S. re \u2018without,\u2019 H. bin \u2018without,\u2019 for instance, may either precede or follow the subst., and in poetry many of the postpositions are used either before or after the subst. governed by them.\n\nNext, I proceed to give some account of adjectives in the\ntwo groups. Adj., when inflected, are generally declined like subst. In Gaurian the termination o or a is masc.; and o and a are changed to i in the fem. In S. adj. in u have also gender, and change it to a or i in the fem. In M. and G. the adj. has, of course, besides masc. and fem., the neut. termination. In S. and P. the adj. agrees with the subst. in number, gender, and case, and in the other languages also, but with some exceptions. Thus, in H. and G. the adj. does not take the obl. form of the subst. in the pl., but that of the obl. sing., and also in H. the nom. fem. i is unchanged in the nom. pl. Further in M. the usual obl. ending is ya sing., y\u0101 pl. for all genders. In B. and O. the adj. is unchanged. In Romance, gender is distinguished as in Lat. in adj. derived from Lat. adj. in us, a; as It. buono, buona; Fr. bon, bonne. With these terminations er and era are confounded; as, It. nero, nera. Many adj., however, which did not distinguish between the masc. and fem. in Lat., make the distinction in Fr.; as, fort, forte, etc. In the Asturian Sp. dialect, I am informed by Prince L. Bonaparte, the adj. has a neut. form, when used substantively, and also when used as a predicate of a neut. pronoun; as, bonu m., bona f., but bono n.; as, lo bono \u2018the good,\u2019 and lo que ye bono \u2018that which is good.\u2019 In Sp. also the neut. form of the article is used with the adj. raised to the quality of a subst.; as, lo bueno. In Old Fr. and Prov., again, according to Diez, the adj. has a neut. form, when it is the predicate of a pronoun used in a neut. sense, or of an entire sentence. Old Fr. bons m., bone f., bon n. The following is a specimen of an adj. in each group:\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| Skr. suhkaas suhkaa suhkam suhkh\u016bs suhkh\u0101s luhkh\u0101ni |\n| Lat. sicu sicu succum sici sicu sicu |\n| M. suki suki suku suke sukya suk\u012b |\n| S. sukko sukki sukka sukki sukhi sukhi |\n| H. sukh\u0101 sukhi sukho sukhi |\n| It. secco secca secchi seche |\n| Fr. sec seche sec secches |\n\nWith reference to the remarks made above about the obl. form of the adj. in Gaurian, we have, for instance, obl. sing. S. and P. var\u0113 ghore; H. bare ghore \u2018magni equi;\u2019 obl. pl. S.\ncar\u0113 ghor\u0113, P. vari\u0101 ghor\u012b\u0101 \u2018magnorum equorum,\u2019 but H. bare ghor\u014d. Both the Skr. and Lat. adj. are compared by flexion: for the comparative degree Skr. iyame and taras, Lat. ior; for the superlative, Skr. tamas and ishtas, Lat. imus and issimus. The modern languages have, in principle, in both groups renounced such flexion. In Gaurian the comparative degree is expressed by simply adding the ablative particle to the subst. with which the comparison is made, the superlative by the employment of the pronoun signifying \u2018all\u2019 followed by the ablative particle. The Romance for the comparative makes use of what was already occasionally employed in Lat., a periphrastic formation by means of adverbs. The signification of superlative is given by placing before the comparative the definite article.\n\nAs regards the numerals, in S. and M. alone in Gaurian is there any distinction of gender, and that only in the first numeral in S., viz. hikku m., hikka f., and in M. in the special forms for two, three, and four; as doghe m., doghi f., dogh\u0113 n. \u2018two.\u2019 In the Romance languages unus alone is subject to flexion in all the languages; as, It. uno, una; Fr. un, une; duo in Port. only; tres only in Old Fr. and Prov., ducente, trecenti, etc., exclusively in Sp. and Port. Mille has a pl., viz. mila, in It. only. The following is a comparison of the first decade in each group:\n\n| Skr. | S. | H. | Lat. | Ir. | Fr. |\n|------|----|----|------|----|----|\n| 1    | ekas, \u0101 | hikku, a | ek | unus, a | uno, a | un, a |\n| 2    | doau | \u1e6da | do | duo | due | deux |\n| 3    | trayas sing. (trai pl.) | tre | tin | tres | tro | trois |\n| 4    | c'atvori pl. (stem c'atur) | c'\u0101ri | c'\u0101r | quattuor | quattro | quatre |\n| 5    | pana | p\u0101n\u0101 | pi\u0101\u015b | quinque | cinque | cinq |\n| 6    | ah\u0101t (stem ah\u0101h) | d'ha | d'ha | sex | sei | six |\n| 7    | septa (stem septan) | satta | s\u0101t | septem | sette | sept |\n| 8    | astha | attha | \u0101th | octo | otto | huit |\n| 9    | nava (stem navan) | n\u0101v\u0101 | nau | novem | nove | neuf |\n| 10   | dua\u015b (stem da\u015ban) | d\u0101ha | das | decem | dieci | dix |\n| 20   | vin\u0101ti | viha | b\u012bs | viginti | venti | vingt |\n\n1 Compare Lat. bis for dois.\nIn Gaurian each numeral is subject to phonetic change, as if it was an independent word. There is no help given to the memory by using the numerals, up to nine, of the first decade unchanged in the other decades, as is the case generally in the European languages; so that it is a considerable tax on the memory to learn the numerals in the Gaurian languages. Thus in H., for instance, for 'vingt un,' instead of *bis ek*, we have *ekis*, from Skr. *ekavim\u015bati*; for 'vingt deux,' instead of *bis do*, we have *b\u0101s*, from Skr. *dr\u0101vim\u015bati*; for 'vingt sept,' *sat\u0101is*, where the long *\u0101* is supposed to be owing to the Skr. oxytone *sapt\u0101* as compared with *\u0113ka*; for the same reason *ath\u0101is* 28, but *pa\u010dis* 25. For 19 the Skr. has *ekonavim\u015bati* 'twenty less one,' Lat. *undeviginti*, which is preserved in M. *ekunav\u012bsa*, Old H. *agunis*; but the more common abbreviated form Skr. *\u016bnavim\u015bati* appears in H. *unis*, S. *uniciha*.\n\nThe ordinal numbers are declined exactly like adj. in both groups. The following are examples. The first ordinal has undergone great change in Gaurian.\n\n| Masc. | Fem. | Masc. | Fem. |\n|-------|------|-------|------|\n| Skr. *pratham\u0101* | pratham\u0101 | Lat. *primus* | prima |\n| S. *pah\u0101y\u014d* | pah\u0101\u012b | It. *primo* | prima |\n| H. *pahil\u0101* | pahili | Old Fr. *prime* | |\n| Skr. *tritiy\u0101* | tritiy\u0101 | Lat. *tertius* | tertia |\n| S. *trijo* | triji | It. *terzo* | terza |\n| Old H. *tijo* | tiji | Old Fr. *tiers* | tierce |\n| H. *tiur\u0101* | tiuri | Fr. *troisi\u00e8me* | |\n| Skr. *caturthas* | caturthi | Lat. *quartus* | quarta |\n| S. *c\u014dth\u014d* | c\u014dth\u012b | It. *quarto* | quarta |\n| H. *c\u0101uth\u0101* | cauth\u012b | Old Fr. *quart* | quarte |\n| Skr. *saptamas* | saptami | Lat. *septimus* | septima |\n| P. *satmi* | satmi | It. *settimo* | settima |\n| Old H. *satmo* | satmi | Old Fr. *seime* | |\n| H. *s\u0101tv\u0101* | s\u0101tv\u012b | Fr. *septi\u00e8me* | |\n\nThe modern H. *ti-sr\u0101* 'third,' and also *d\u016b-sr\u0101* 'second,' are formed by the addition of the suffix *sr\u0101*, as the modern Fr. *deux-i\u00e8me*, *trois-i\u00e8me*, by the addition of *i\u00e8me = esimus*.\n\nThe article, which plays such an important part in the Romance languages, was unknown both to Skr. and Lat. The first numeral is used as the indefinite article in both the modern groups, though not to the same extent in Gaurian as\nin Romance. Gaurian, however, has no definite article, though the demonstrative pronoun is occasionally used, as *ille* was in late Lat.\n\nThe pronouns in both groups have a nom. and an obl. form, the latter being apparently from the Skr. and Lat. gen. though in Romance also, in some instances, from the Lat. acc. and dat. The first and second personal pronoun in each group may be thus compared:\n\n### 1st Personal Pronoun\n\n| Sing. | Pl. | Sing. | Pl. |\n|-------|-----|-------|-----|\n| Skr. nom. *aham* | *asma* (stem) | Lat. nom. *ego* | *nos* |\n| S. \" | *\u0101u*, \u0101 | *as\u012b* | It. \" | *io* | noi |\n| H. \" | *h\u014d* | *ham* | Fr. \" | *jo* | nous |\n| Skr. gen. *mama*, *me* | *as\u0101kam* | Lat. acc. dat. *me*, *mi* | |\n| S. obl. *m\u016b*, *m\u0101* | *as\u0101* | It. obl. *me* | |\n| H. \" | *mo* | *ham*, *ham\u014d* | Fr. \" | *moi* |\n\n### 2nd Personal Pronoun\n\n| Sing. | Pl. | Sing. | Pl. |\n|-------|-----|-------|-----|\n| Skr. nom. *tum* | *yushma* (stem) | Lat. nom. *tu* | *vos* |\n| S. \" | *t\u016b* | *tekh\u012b* | It. \" | *tu* | voi |\n| H. \" | *t\u016b* | *tum* | Fr. \" | *tu* | vous |\n| Skr. gen. *tava* | *yushmakam* | Lat. acc. dat. *te*, *tibi* | |\n| S. obl. *to* | *tav\u0101\u1e25* | It. obl. *to* | |\n| H. \" | *to* | *tum*, *tun\u014d* | Fr. \" | *toi* |\n\nThe forms given above as H. are Braj forma. In High H. the obl. forms are *mujh*, *tujh*, and are from Pr. *majjha*, *tujjha*, from which a dat. is formed in High H. *mujhe*, *tujhe*, and from the pl. *ham*, *tum*, a dat. *han\u0113*, *tum\u0113*. High H. also has *m\u0101i* from nom. sing. 1st pers. pron., though *h\u014d* occurs in most of the dialects; M. in the same way has *mi* for the nom., O. *mu*, and B. *mui*; all originally obl. forms. The obl. form is also sometimes used in Fr. for the nom., as in *moi qui lis*.\n\nThe reflexive pronoun in Gaurian, as S. *p\u0101na*, H. *\u0101p*, etc., is derived by a remarkable phonetic change from the Skr. reflexive pronoun *\u0101tm\u0101* 'self,' acc. *\u0101tm\u0101nam*. The reflexive pronoun in Romance, as It. *se*, Fr. *soi*, is from Lat. *se*, *sibi*.\n\n---\n\n1 The Skr. nom. pl. *cayam*, Pr. *cayam*, has not survived in Gaurian.\nThe Skr. possessive pronouns madiya and tvadiya are not found in Gaurian. The possessive pronouns in most of the Gaurian languages, as H. mer\u0101, G. m\u0101ro \u2018my,\u2019 H. ter\u0101, G. t\u0101ro \u2018thy,\u2019 are probably formed by incorporating the Pr. kera (Skr. past part. k\u1e5bita \u2018made\u2019), before referred to, with elision of k, with the obl. form of the pronoun. The possessive of the reflexive pronoun, as H. apn\u0101, M. \u0101pl\u0101, is referred to the Skr. possessive atm\u012byas \u2018own.\u2019 These possessive forms are used as the gen. of the subst. pronouns. In S. the gen. relation of the subst. pronouns, as of the subst., is expressed by the postposition j\u014d, and the genitive is used as the possessive pronoun. In Old Fr. also, as in most of the Gaurian languages, possessive pronouns are formed by attaching a suffix to an obl. form of the subst. pronoun; as, mien, tien; otherwise the old Lat. possessive survives in the modern languages. The possessive pronouns are declined like adj. in both groups; as, H. me-r\u0101, me-ri, Old Fr. mi-en, mi-enne; H. te-r\u0101, te-ri, Old Fr. ti-en, ti-enne; H. apn\u0101, apni, It. suo, sua.\n\nThe demonstrative pronouns are used for the pronoun of the 3rd person in Gaurian. S. M. and some dialects of H. distinguish gender in the demonstrative. The other languages do not make the distinction. Thus we have Skr. ayam m. \u2018this,\u2019 S. hi m. and f., hiu m. hia f., H. yah (dial. i); Skr. gen. sing. asya; obl. sing. P. ih, H. is (S. hina or ina); Skr. nom. pl. ime, S. hi, he, H. ye; Skr. gen. pl. \u0101n\u0101m for e\u0161h\u0101m, S. hini or ini, H. in. Hoernle, however, derives the modern near demonstrative from the Skr. iyat (or Ved. irat), Pr. e \u2018so much,\u2019 and also with regard to all the simple pronouns, except the personal, he thinks that in most cases \u201cthe forms which are now used as simple pron. were originally those of pron. adj. of quality or quantity.\u201d In Romance hic and is have not been able to maintain themselves, but ille has been preserved, and is now used exclusively as the pron. of the 3rd person. We have thus from Lat. ille, illa, It. egli, ella, Fr. il, elle; Lat. illius, It. and Fr. lui m.; but It. lei f., Fr. elle f.; Lat. illi, illae and illos, illae, It. egli-no, elle-no, Fr. ils, elles; Lat. illorum, It. loro (Fr. leur conj. form). Sp. has also a neut. form, viz. \u00e9l m., ella f., ello n.\nBesides the above forms there are also in Romance conjunctive forms of the pronouns attached to the verb, which express the acc. and dat. relations. It is only the S. among the Gaurians that has such forms; they are always suffixed. They cannot be used either before or after the verb, as is generally the case in It. Sp. and Port. Both in S. and in Romance these conjunctive forms are for the most part abridgments of the absolute forms. Compared with It. the forms are in the sing. S. me, It. mi; S. i (with elision of t), It. ti; S. si, It. dat. gli, li, acc. lo, il; in pl. S. \u00fc, It. ci; S. ra, It. ci; S. ni, It. dat. loro, acc. gli, li. In S. there is only one form, whether to express the dat. or acc. relation, whereas in Romance, as shown above, there is for the 3rd pers. pron. one form for the dat., another for the acc. relation. Also in S., except with the past part., only one conj. pron. can be suffixed to the verb. The following are a few instances of the way in which the pronominal suffixes are used in S. as compared with It.; as S. din-mi 'give me,' It. da-mmi; S. din-i, It. diano-ti; S. dini-va, It. diano-vi. In S. the pronominal suffixes are also used with nouns and particles, but not nearly to the same extent as with verbs. The fusion of the particle and pronoun might be compared with that of the preposition and article in Romance, but the conjunctive pronouns cannot be used with prepositions in Romance.\n\nThe relative pron. in Gaurian has both a sing. and pl. form in all the languages; gender is distinguished in S. and M. only. The simple interrogative pron. Skr. kas, k\u00e2, kad (the original neuter form), has in Gaurian a pl. form either in the nom. or obl.; gender is distinguished in G. only. In the Romance descendants of qui, quae, quod, no distinction of either gender or number has been preserved. Thus we have rel. pron. sing. Skr. yas m. y\u00e2 f., S. jo m. j\u00e2 f., H. jo; pl. Skr. ye, S. je, H. je. Inter. pron. Skr. kas, Old H. ko, B. ke. High H. kaun comes from a derivative form of the original interrogative. Lat. qui, It. che, Fr. que; Lat. quis, It. chi, Fr. qui; both forms without flexion for gender or number in Romance. The Gaurians have also an obl. form for the rel.\nand inter. pronouns generally derived from the Skr. gen.; as H. jia from yasya, kia from kasya; pl. jin from y\u0101nam for yesh\u0101m, kin from k\u0101n\u0101m for k\u0113h\u0101m. These pronouns, however, Hoernle would derive from Skr. y\u0101vat, Ap. Pr. jera, and Skr. kiya\u1e6d (Ved. kivat), Ap. Pr. keva. It. Prov. and Old Fr. have the Lat. dat. cui for their obl. sing. and pl. The Gaurians have also an interrogative used in a neuter sense; as S. \u00e9ha, H. ky\u0101, from Skr. kim (Vedic kad), which corresponds to the Fr. quoi from quid.\n\nSkr. ki\u1e0dri\u1e63as m., ki\u1e0dri\u1e63\u012b f. \u2018of what kind?\u2019 supplies the common interrogative in S. and P., as S. keho, kehi \u2018which?\u2019. Lat. qualis, which is connected with ki\u1e0dri\u1e63as by change of d to l, is interrogative in Romance; as, It. quale, Fr. quel, quelle. With the article it is relative; as, It. il quale, Fr. lequel. Again, ki\u1e0drikas \u2018qualis\u2019 becomes S. kiharo \u2018of what kind?\u2019, H. ka\u00efsa; and Skr. ta\u1e0drikas \u2018such like\u2019 becomes S. teho, H. ta\u00efs; and Lat. talis, It. tale, Fr. tel. Skr. kiya\u1e47 m. kiya\u1e6d\u012b f., with stem kiya\u1e47t (Ved. kivant) \u2018how much,\u2019 becomes S. ketaro m. ketari f. (ro, ri pleonastic), H. kitt\u0101 m. kitli f.; and Lat. quantus, quanta, It. quanto, quanta, Old Fr. quant, quante.\n\nI now come to the verb. The Skr. and Lat. verbs appear in the modern groups, subject of course to the usual phonetic modifications; as, Skr. path\u0101mi \u2018I read,\u2019 S. parh\u0101, H. parh\u014d; Lat. lego, It. leggo, Fr. li(s); Skr. pari-te\u1e63hy\u0101mi \u2018I offer (food),\u2019 S. par-os\u0101, H. par-os\u014d; Lat. pro-video, It. pro-vedo, Fr. pour-roi(s). There are not, however, nearly so many prepositions joined with verbs in Gaurian as in Romance, nor are they used for new formations in Gaurian as in Romance. Other verbs again are of a secondary kind, derived from nouns or participles or otherwise not directly representative of the ancient verb; as, Skr. paricayana\u1e41 \u2018cognizance,\u2019 H. pahc\u0101n-na \u2018to recognize;\u2019 Skr. pravisha \u2018entered,\u2019 H. paith-na \u2018to enter;\u2019 Lat. festum, Fr. f\u00eate; Lat. tractus, Fr. tracer.\n\nAs regards derivative forms, in Gaurian a causal may be formed from a simple verb by an addition to the stem. This formative is generally a in S. H. B. and O., av in G., au in\nP., *avi* in M.; as, S. *kar-anu*, H. *kar-na* \u2018to do\u2019; S. *kar\u0101-inu*, H. *kar\u0101-na* \u2018to cause to do.\u2019 The modern formative is derived from the Skr. causal formative *api*, which, however, is much less used in Skr. than the *i* formative. The desiderative and intensive forms of the Skr. verb are not found in the modern languages. These meanings are expressed in the moderns by adding an auxil. to the principal verb; as, H. *ph\u0113kna* \u2018to throw,\u2019 *ph\u0113k\u0101 d\u0101hna* \u2018to desire to throw,\u2019 *ph\u0113k den\u0101* \u2018to throw away.\u2019 The Lat. derivative forms have generally been preserved in Romance, but with less precision as to their meaning, and they often take the place altogether of the simple forms; also new formations are very numerous; as, It. *usare*, Fr. *user* (frequentative form); It. *mansuesere*, Fr. *obscurcir* (inchoative forms).\n\nThe verbs have been remodelled to a great extent in both groups. In Skr. the verbs are divided into certain classes according to the nature of the stem with which the present and three other tenses or moods and a participle are formed, the remaining tenses taking the terminations on a different system. In one of the classes the root alone is the stem, but in the others the stem is formed with certain additions to the root. In Gaurian, as the rule, all parts of the verb are derived from the same stem which is sometimes formed by incorporating a class suffix of the Skr. Thus we have Skr. *\u015binomi* (stem *\u015b\u012bnu*, *\u015bi* being the root and *nu* the suffix of the 5th class) \u2018I gather,\u2019 S. *\u015bhin\u0101*, H. *\u015bin\u0101*; Skr. past part. *\u015bitas* \u2018gathered,\u2019 but S. *\u015bhinio*, H. *\u015bina*. All the modern verbs, however, are held to be derived from a stem with *a* for its final vowel. Thus with reference to the above instance we shall have to assume a form *\u015bin\u0101mi* instead of *\u015binomi* as the origin of the modern forms. The forms of the modern verb will be given in detail further on. In derivation, however, other stems are frequently changed to what appears to be that of the 6th class; as, Skr. *pishami* for *pinashmi* \u2018I grind,\u2019 S. *pih\u0101*, H. *pis\u0101*. What are called the irregular verbs in Gaurian are the least so in regard to their origin. In these verbs the past participle, instead of being formed from the present stem as in the regular verb, is derived from\nthe Skr. past part. pass.; as, Skr. karomi 'I do,' S. kar\u0101, H. kar\u016b; Skr. kritas 'done,' S. kito, also kio and kayo, H. kiya; Skr. pravisami 'I enter,' S. pih\u0101; Skr. pravishlas 'entered,' S. petho. These irregular verbs are numerous in S., while there are very few of them in H.\n\nThe distinctions which characterize the Lat. conjugations are more or less preserved in Romance, but many verbs change their conjugation in passing from Lat. to Romance; as, Lat. lussire, Fr. tousser, etc. What are usually called the irregular verbs in Romance, to which Diez has given the name of strong, while the regulars he terms weak, are mainly distinguished by having the accent on the radical syllable of the 1st and 3rd pers. sing. of the perfect, and to a considerable extent also on the radical syllable of the past part., while in the weak verbs the accent is on the flexion. The former, as regards their origin, are not less regular than the latter. The so-called regular and irregular verbs, therefore, are alike in both groups so far as the regular verb has one kind of participle and the irregular another; but the Gaurian verbs cannot be classed as strong and weak, for the participle is always accented on the root syllable. Weak verbs in Romance are such as, Lat. canto, It. canto, Fr. chant(e); Lat. cantatus, It. cantato, Fr. chant\u00e9; strong, as Lat. dico, It. dico, Fr. dis; Lat. dictus, It. detto, Fr. dit. Many of the Lat. strong verbs, however, have become weak in Romance.\n\nThe original tenses preserved in Gaurian are the pres. indic. and the imperative, in all the languages, the fut. in Old H. and G. It should be noted, however, that the pres. indic. has become the pres. subj. in S. H. and P., though colloquially, it is frequently used in its original sense. In the literary form of these languages a new pres. formed with the pres. part. has taken the place of the old pres. In Romance more old tenses have been preserved. The pres., imperf., and perf. indic. have been preserved in all the languages, the pluperf. in Sp. Port. and Prov. Of the subj., the pres. and pluperf. have been maintained in all the languages, and the fut. anterior in Sp. and Port. The first\ntense of the imperative has also been saved in all the languages. The following is a comparison of the pres. indic. in both groups, taking likh \u2018write\u2019 for the Gaurian, and canto for the Romance, as examples:\n\n**PRESENT INDICATIVE.**\n\n| Sanskrit | Sindhi | Hindi | Latin | Italian | French |\n|----------|--------|-------|-------|---------|--------|\n| Sing. 1  | likh-\u0101mi | likh-\u0101 | likh-\u0101 | cant-o | chant(e) |\n| 2       | likh-\u0101si | likh-\u0101 | likh-\u0101 | cant-as | chant-as |\n| 3       | likh-\u0101ti | likh-\u0101 | likh-\u0101 | cant-at | chant-at |\n| Pl. 1   | likh-\u0101mas | likh-\u0101 | likh-\u0101 | cant-amos | chant-ons |\n| 2       | likh-\u0101tha | likh-a | likh-a | cant-atia | chant-atia |\n| 3       | likh-\u0101nti | likh-\u0101ni | likh-\u0101 | cant-ant | chant-ant |\n\nThe Skr. 1st sing. -\u0101mi is best represented by the O. -\u0101i. The H. \u0101 is referred by Hoernle to an Ap. Pr. form \u0101im. The Skr. 2nd sing. is unchanged in the Old H. likhasi. The 3rd sing. in Old H. is likh\u0101i. The Skr. 3rd pl. remains in O. -anti. Regarding the e of the 1st sing. of such verbs as Fr. chante, it is hardly necessary to remark that this is a modern addition and does not belong to Old Fr. The same remark applies to the s of the 1st sing. of the other conjugations previously instanced. The 2nd sing. of the Skr. imperative is alone preserved in S. H. and P., and the sing. only of the Lat. pres. imperative in most of the Romance languages, the pres. indic. in both groups taking the place of the old pl. In Sp. and Port., however, the old pl. is preserved, and in the rest of the Gaurian languages both the 2nd and 3rd pl. of the old imperative are preserved\u2014thus:\n\n**IMPERATIVE.**\n\n| Sg. | 2 Skr. likh-a | S. likh-u | H. likh | Lat. cant-a | It. cant-a | Fr. chante |\n|-----|----------------|-----------|--------|-------------|------------|-----------|\n|     | 3 likh-\u0101tu | O. likh-u | M. lik-o |\n| Pl. | 2 likh-\u0101ta | likh-a | likh-\u0101 | cant-ate Sp. cant-ad Port. cant-ai |\n|     | 3 likh-\u0101ntu | likh-\u0101ntu | likh-\u0101ntu | likh-\u0101ntu | cant-ate Sp. cant-ad Port. cant-ai |\n\nThere is also a precative or respectful form of the imperative in some Gaurians which is generally referred to the Skr. precative; as, 2 sing. Skr. likh-y\u0101s, S. likh-yi, H. likh-iye. Hoernle, however, thinks that these are really passive forms, but used actively.\n\nIn Old H. and G. the simple fut. derived from the Skr.\nfut. is, for instance, Skr. likh-ishy\u0101mi, Old H. likhi-iha\u016b, G. lakh-is. Instances of the other simple tenses retained in Romance are, the imperf.; as, Lat. cantabam, It. cantava, Fr. chantai(s); perf., Lat. cantavi, It. cantai, Fr. chantai; pres. subj., Lat. cantem, It. cante, Fr. chant(e); the pluperf. subj., Lat. cantassem, It. cantassi, Fr. chantasse; the pluperf. indic., in Sp. Port. and Prov. only, as, Lat. cantaram, Sp. cantara; and the fut. anterior in Sp. and Port. only, as, Lat. cantaro, Sp. cantare. The Skr. infinitive in tum, which is identical with the Lat. supine in tum, has disappeared in Gaurian, as have also the Lat. supines in Romance. In place of the Skr. infinitive, the modern infinitive, which is declined like a subst., is formed by two different suffixes, the characteristic letter of one being v (b), of the other n. The former is found in B. O. G. and in Braj; the latter in High H. and in S. P. and M. These forms are derived by Hoernle from the two forms of the Skr. fut. part. pass., the v (b) form from the part. in tarya, the n form from the part. in anya; as, Skr. likhitarya, Braj likhibau, Skr. likhaniya, S. likhapi. The functions of the Lat. supines, which, as has been stated, are wanting in Romance, are, generally, discharged by the infinitive. The pres. of the inf. has been preserved; as, Lat. cantare, It. cantare, Fr. chanter. The pres. part. has been preserved in both groups, as Skr. stem likhant, S. likhando, H. likhat\u0101; but generally with the value of an adj. in Romance, Lat. cantantem, It. cantante, Fr. chantant. The rule of the pres. part. in Romance generally devolves on the gerundive, which is preserved in its abl. form; as, Lat. cantando, It. cantando, Fr. chantant. The past part. has also been preserved in both groups; as, Skr. likhitas, S. likhio, H. likh\u0101; Lat. cantatus, It. cantato, Fr. chant\u00e9.\n\nThe part. of the Skr. fut. pass. in tavya, from which, as has been observed, the inf. in some of the languages is derived, has been preserved also in its part. sense in S. G. and P.; as, S. likhibo, meaning 'being written.' The conjunctive part., as it is called, which is common to all the Gaurians, is believed, in most instances, to be derived from the Skr. indecl. past part. in ya; as, S. likhi, Old H. likhi, in\nAfter the fall, the final form was imposed. In some, but not in all the languages, the first and last parts were used as names without the addition of any suffix or auxiliary word. In the oldest known written work, the name of the Roman language is that of Latin, which is still used today. The word preserved in L. is L., whereas elsewhere it has a different meaning, such as the adjective \"Latin\" in L. The word \"Latin\" means the language of Latin, whereas in L. it is L. In L., the adjective \"Latin\" is still used, but it is written in Latin, L.\n\nThe names of the languages of Latin civilization, which is the language of the modern languages, are arranged in four groups: L., representing a language with no suffixes; L., a language represented with some form of the suffixes; L., which is used when the particular language is not yet known; and L., an ancient language written in Latin script.\n\nThe word \"Latin\" is used in the languages of Latin groups, and the suffixes were added to bring consistency and clarity to the language. The word \"Latin\" is also used when a language is derived from the Latin, as in L., where the word \"Latin\" refers to something belonging to Rome, while the word \"L.\" refers to a language that is not Latin, but rather a language that is similar to Latin.\n\nIn Latin, the word \"Latin\" is used when there is a need to refer to a language that is similar to Latin, but is not part of the Latin language family. The word \"Latin\" is also used when referring to a language that is not Latin, but rather a language that is similar to Latin.\n\nIn Latin, the word \"Latin\" is used when referring to a language that is not Latin, but rather a language that is similar to Latin. The word \"Latin\" is also used when referring to a language that is not Latin, but rather a language that is similar to Latin.\nOf the contracted periphrastic forms there is in S. what Trumpp calls the aorist, formed from the past part., and what appears to be the remains of the pres. tense of the Skr. as \u2018to be,\u2019 incorporated with it, in which the masc. and fem. gender are distinguished; as, haliu-si masc., halia-si fem. \u2018I went,\u2019 but this formation only occurs in the case of intrans. verbs; in B. and O. also a perf. tense formed from the part. in ia, and the pres. tense of the verb \u0101bhi \u2018I am\u2019; as B. likhiy-\u0101bhi pronounced likhech\u012b \u2018I have written.\u2019 There are, however, other tenses in Gaurian, which are formed from a part. and suffixed terminations which resemble, generally, the personal terminations of the old pres. indic., from which they are derived by Hoernle, though Beames apparently regards them as specially those or a remnant of the old Skr. subst. verb as \u2018to be.\u2019 Thus we have in M. a definite pres., in which gender is distinguished, formed from the pres. part., as M. lihit-\u014d masc., lihity-\u014d fem. \u2018I write\u2019; also in M. a perf. tense formed from the past part. in ala with the same suffixes. A 2nd perf. tense, formed in a similar way from the past part. in al or il, occurs in B. and O. Of similar construction again is a past subj. tense in M. B. and O. formed from the present part.\n\nThe future tense is formed in several ways in Gaurian. In Old H. and G., as before pointed out, it is the old Skr. fut. after the usual phonetic changes. In S. the fut. is formed by adding to the pres. part. the same terminations derived from the subst. verb as \u2018to be,\u2019 as for the aorist; likhandu-si masc., likhandia-si fem. \u2018I shall write.\u2019 In B. and O. the fut. is made by suffixing to the old fut. part., which, as before mentioned, has become the infinitive in these languages, what appear to be the personal terminations referred to in the preceding paragraph; as O. likhil\u012b-i \u2018I shall write.\u2019 In H. and P. the fut. is formed by adding the past part. gay\u0101 \u2018gone\u2019 contracted to ga, which agrees in number and gender with the subject of the verb, to the old pres. indic., which, as before explained, has become the subjunctive; as, H. likh\u014d-g\u0101 m., likh\u014d-gi f. \u2018I shall write,\u2019 literally \u2018I am gone that I may write.\u2019 In M. the future is\nformed on the same principle by adding the past part. el 'come,' contracted to l, to the pres. indic.; as, lihe-l 'he shall write.' In all the Romance languages the fut. is formed from the inf. and the pres. tense of habeo contracted into one word; as, It. canter-\u00f4, Fr. chanter-ai. The other tenses of the contracted kind in Romance are the conditional in all the languages, as Lat. cantare habebam, It. canteria, Fr. chanterais, and a second conditional tense belonging to It. only; as, Lat. cantare habui, It. cantere.\n\nOther tenses in both groups are formed with a part. and an auxil. verb, not contracted together in the manner of the last-mentioned class. The participial member of the compound tense, in most of the Gaurian languages, agrees with the subject, whereas in Romance such agreement only takes place where esse is used as the auxil. The order of the words is also generally different in the two groups, for whereas the part. comes first in Gaurian, in Romance the auxil. is the first member of the compound.\n\nThe perf. in Gaurian may thus be compared with the periphrastic perf. in Romance, which has almost superseded the old perf., the tenses being formed in both groups with the perf. part. and an auxil. verb\u2014I give first an example of an intransitive verb; as, S. halio ah\u00eey\u00e2 m., hal\u00ee ah\u00eey\u00e2 f., H. cal\u00e2 h\u00fb m., cal\u00ee h\u00fb f., 'I have gone,' from Skr. \u00e9calitas, \u00e1, 'gone,' and asmi 'I am'; It. sono andato, sono andata, Fr. Fr. suis all\u00e9, suis all\u00e9e; also with habeo; as, It. ho dormito, Fr. ai dormi. Again, the pluperf. may be compared; as, S. halio hos\u00ee, H. cal\u00e2 th\u00e2 'I had gone' (here the S. hos\u00ee is the aorist of huanyu 'to be' from Skr. bh\u00fb, while H. th\u00e2 is from Skr. sth\u00eetas past part. of sth\u00e2 'stand,' Lat. status, It. stato, Fr. \u00e9t\u00e9); It. era andato, Fr. etais all\u00e9, and with habebam; as, It. aveva dormito, Fr. avais dormi. Also a past future; as, S. halio hundusi, H. cal\u00e2 h\u00fbg\u00e2; It. sar\u00f2 andato, Fr. serai all\u00e9, and with habeo; as, It. avr\u00f2 dormito, Fr. aurai dormi. The auxil. verbs are in the modern fut. tense in both groups.\n\nIn the compound tenses of the transitive verb formed with the past part. there are important differences of construction not only between Romance and Gaurian, but also between\nEastern and Western Gaurian. Thus in It. we may say *ho scritta la lettera*, where the auxil. *ho* is a transitive verb, and *la lettera* is in the acc. relation with which the part. *scritta* agrees in number and gender. In Fr. it is only when the object precedes that this construction is used; as, *la lettre que j\u2019ai \u00e9crite*. In other cases the origin of this construction is forgotten, and the compound tense used as if it was a simple perf.; as in It. we may also say *ho scritto la lettera*, and in Fr. always when the object follows, *j\u2019ai \u00e9crit la lettre*. In B. we say *mui cithi likhiy-achhi* \u2018I have written the letter.\u2019 Here *likhiy-achhi* is the 1st sing. perf. tense agreeing with the nom. *mui* \u2018I.\u2019 It is compounded of *achhi* \u2018I am\u2019 and the part. *likhia*, which though by origin the past part. passive, is used in an active sense, and *cithi* \u2018the letter\u2019 is in the acc. relation towards it. An example of Western Gaurian is S. *cithi m\u016b likhi ahe* \u2018I have written the letter,\u2019 more literally, \u2018the letter by me has been written.\u2019 Here *cithi* f. \u2018the letter\u2019 is in the nom. and the part. *likhi* is fem. to agree with *cithi*, *m\u016b* \u2018by me,\u2019 is in the oblique form, and the auxil. *ahe* \u2018is\u2019 from the Skr. *asti*. Thus the construction is passive in its nature. The passive part. in Skr. was frequently used in the same way. In High H. the postposition *ne* is added to the oblique form; as, *m\u0101i ne cithi likhi hai*. This is the rule also in the literary forms of the other Western languages except S. In Old H., however, the postposition is very rarely found. There is another kind of construction in Western Gaurian. We may also say as in S. *cithi khe m\u016b likhi ahe* \u2018as to the letter by me it has been written,\u2019 where *cithi* has the dat. particle *khe*, and the verb is used impersonally in the 3rd masc. sing.\n\nThere are also other tenses in both groups formed in the same way with the past part. and an auxil.; though they may not all so exactly correspond in meaning as those instanced above. In Gaurian several tenses are formed from the pres. part. and an auxil. verb; as, H. *kahte h\u0101i* \u2018they are saying\u2019 (Old Fr. *sont disans*); and those languages that have the fut. part. turn it to account in the same way. In some of the Gaurian languages, again, a pres. indic. is formed by\nusing the old pres. indic. with some auxil. verb; as S. likh\u0101 tho, Braj. likh\u0101 h\u0101 \u2018I write.\u2019 The S. tho = H. tha is contracted from thio, past part. of thi\u0101u \u2018to be,\u2019 Lat. stare. Further, there is a periphrastic part. in each group; as S. likhi kare, H. likh-kar \u2018having written,\u2019 It. avendo cantato, Fr. ayant chant\u00e9.\n\nIn all the Gaurian languages, except S., and occasionally P., the passive signification is rendered by the past part. and an auxil., derived from the Skr. y\u0101 \u2018to go,\u2019 which is conjugated like any other verb in the active voice. In Romance the passive is formed also from the past part. and the auxil. esse, Skr. as. Besides esse, stare, ire and venire are also employed in Romance for the periphrasis of the passive. In both groups the auxil. verb expresses by its form the person, number, tense, etc., while the part., besides giving the meaning, retains its rights as an adj., that is, it has gender, number, and case (nom.); as, H. likh\u0101 j\u0101e m., likhi j\u0101e f. \u2018it is written;\u2019 pl. likhe j\u0101e m., likhi j\u0101e f. \u2018they are written;\u2019 P. likh\u0101 j\u0101ce m., likhi j\u0101ce f., pl. likhe j\u0101n m., likhi\u0101 j\u0101n f.; It. \u00e8 cantato, \u00e8 cantata; sono cantati, sono cantate; Fr. est chant\u00e9, est chant\u00e9e; sont chant\u00e9s, sont chant\u00e9es. In B. and O. the part., any more than the adj., is not inflected. When the part. of the auxil. verb is used, it is inflected also in Gaurian and in It.; but not in the other Romance languages; as, H. likhi gayi hai f. \u2018it has been written,\u2019 It. \u00e8 stata cantata, but not Fr. \u00e9t\u00e9e.\n\nIn Gaurian many verbs are intransitive or transitive, according as the vowel of the root is short or long. Such intransitive verbs, if translated into English, would often take the passive form; as, H. ka\u1e47\u1e0da \u2018to be cut,\u2019 ka\u1e6d\u1e47\u0101 \u2018to cut,\u2019 pi\u1e6d\u1e47\u0101 \u2018to be beaten,\u2019 pi\u1e6d\u1e47\u0101 \u2018to beat,\u2019 lip\u1e47\u0101 \u2018to be smeared,\u2019 lepn\u0101 \u2018to smear.\u2019 These transitive forms appear to be derived from the ordinary Skr. causal, which is formed by intensifying the vowel of the root, and by the addition of final i. This i often enters into the conjugation of transitive verbs in S., as, S. maru \u2018die,\u2019 m\u0101ri \u2018kill,\u2019 mar\u0101 \u2018I die,\u2019 m\u0101ri\u0101 \u2018I kill.\u2019 But there is, properly speaking, no such thing as a transitive distinguished from an intransitive conjugation in\nthis or any other Aryan language, and accordingly Trumpp gives a long list of transitive verbs in S. which do not take \\(i\\), that is, which are not causal forms. The suffix \\(i\\) is met with in M. also. In Romance the reflexive voice after the loss of the organic passive has become of great importance, and often takes the place of the passive; as, It. il libro non si trova.\n\nAs regards adverbs, many of the old adverbs have been preserved in both groups, and many have been formed from the oblique cases of subst. In Gaurian there are many adverbs derived from the oblique cases of pronouns. In Romance there are many formed of subst. combined with prepositions. The most remarkable phenomenon, however, of the Romance languages was the adoption of the ablative mente, It. mente, Fr. ment, as a general grammatical mark of the adverb. Nothing of this sort was effected in Gaurian.\n\nIn Skr. and Lat. a word could generally be placed in any part of the sentence, but the loss of case flexions in the modern languages of both groups requires greater order in the arrangement of the words. In this order the two groups are sometimes in accord, but more frequently this is not the case. Thus, in both groups, nouns of number precede the governing subst., and so do adj. pronouns, and also the subject precedes the object. On the other hand, the adj. precedes the subst. in Gaurian, follows it, as the rule, in Romance. In the periphrastic tenses the auxil. comes before the part. in Gaurian, after it, usually, in Romance. The infinitive precedes the verb on which it depends in Gaurian, follows it, usually, in Romance. The adverb precedes the verb in Gaurian, follows it in Romance. The verb, again, which is the central point of the sentence in Romance, is placed at the end in Gaurian. The relation between two subst. is frequently signified by position in Gaurian, the dependent subst. coming first, where in Romance it would be necessary to use a prep.; as, H. janam bh\u00fcm, Fr. lieu de naissance; H. n\u0101c ghar, Fr. salle de danse.\n\nA comparison in any detail of the syntax would take up too much space. I may, however, give a few points of\nagreement between the two groups, where they can be briefly stated, and with these I will conclude my paper. The pronoun of the 2nd person, tu, is restricted in both groups to the language of love and extreme familiarity, or of contempt, and is used also in addressing an inferior. The pl., as H. tum, Fr. vous, has taken the place of the sing. to a great extent, and Fr. does not go beyond vous, but the other languages push their obsequiousness still further; as M. apan, H. ap; It. co signoria and ella, Sp. usted. In some of the Gaurian languages, especially in the Eastern languages, the pl. of the 1st personal pronoun is often used for the sing., a use which in Romance rather belongs to the language of Princes. The reflexive pronoun in Gaurian, the S. p\u0101na, H. ap, etc., is the reflexive for all three persons, whereas the Romance se refers only to the 3rd person. The distinction between the possessive of the reflexive pronoun and the genitive of the personal pronoun\u2014the Lat. suus and ejus\u2014is carefully preserved in Gaurian, and among the Romance languages the literary It. is said to be the most scrupulous in this respect; as, H. vah apne b\u0101p ko dekhe, It. egli vede suo padre; H. vah uske b\u0101p ko dekhe, It. egli vede il padre di lui; but the Fr. il voie son p\u00e8re is equivocal. The rest of the languages also are often negligent in this respect. On the other hand, when the reference is to the possession of several, suus gives way to the demonstrative illorum in all the Romance languages, except Sp. and Port.; as, Fr. ils roient leur p\u00e8re.\n\nThe acc. relation in Gaurian is sometimes expressed by the dat. particle. In H., as the rule, this is the case when the object is a rational being. The acc. in Sp. is also expressed by the dat. particle \u00e1, when the subst. denotes a person, then an animate being in general. Thus we say in H. b\u0101p bete ko dekhe, Sp. el padre ce al hijo. The government of nouns by prep. and postp. has already been referred to. Adverbs are also placed under their dependence; as, H. yah\u0101 talak, Fr. jusqu\u2019ici. The infinitive in both the modern groups has many more functions to perform than in the ancient languages. Among these functions, in its quality of\nTHE GAURIAN AND THE ROMANCE LANGUAGES.\n\nsubst., it can be used in all the relations of case, and is even inflected like a noun. Its use, however, in Fr. in these respects is more restricted. The following are a few examples of the application of the inf. in both groups; as, H. marn\u0101 sab k\u0101 bh\u0101g hai, Fr. mourir est le sort de tous; H. p\u0101p thorn\u0101 bhal\u0101 hai, Fr. quitter le p\u00e9ch\u00e9 est bon; H. m\u0101i ek bij m\u0101gne \u0101y\u0101 h\u016b, Fr. je suis venu demander une chose; and as a substitute for the part. fut. pass.; as, H. sab m\u0101nas\u014d ko marn\u0101 hai, Fr. tous les hommes ont \u00e0 mourir; or with a prep. or postp. in both groups; as, H. khone ka d\u0101r, Fr. crainte de perdre; H. pine ko dend, Fr. donner \u00e0 boire; H. kothi b\u0113c\u0113na ko, Fr. maison \u00e0 vendre; H. parhne ko kathin, Fr. difficile \u00e0 lire; H. bind\u0101 dekhne kisiko, Fr. sans voir personne; and, again, where it is used completely as a noun; as, H. is per ka girn\u0101, It. il cadere di quest\u2019 albero; H. gh\u014dr\u0101 dekhne par, It. al vedere il cavallo. In these two last-mentioned uses of the inf. Fr. is unable to follow the other languages.\n\nAs before remarked, the present part. in Romance only retains its adjectival value. The gerundive in its ablative form has encroached on the former domain of the present part., while in Gaurian the present part. retains its verbal value; as, S. \u015binghand\u0101 ab\u0101ni, but It. gemendo vengono; H. m\u0101i r\u0101j\u0101 ko ghore par karht\u0101 dekh\u014d, but Fr. je veie le roi montant \u00e0 cheval. The past part. is used in the same way in both groups; as, gh\u014dre par \u0101rhi vah \u012b hai, Fr. mont\u00e9e sur un cheval elle est venue. Besides the present and past part. there is also the conjunctive part. in Gaurian; as, H. sab log bagh dekhi bh\u0101gne lag\u0113, in Fr. tous les hommes voyant le tigre commencent \u00e0 fuir. The present and past part. in Gaurian and the gerundive and past part. in Romance are also used in an absolute sense, a construction which is favourable to brevity of expression and avoids the creation of separate clauses with relative pronouns or conjunctions. This construction in Romance corresponds to the ablative absolute in Lat. Thus we have S. m\u016b ruande r\u0101ti vih\u0101-i, Fr. moi pleurant passe la nuit (toi); H. deo s\u0101th rahte m\u0101i ky\u0101 d\u0101r\u014d, Fr. Dieu \u00e9tant avec (moi) que crains-je; S. rejani rethei dosu pehi dari diyo, It. seduti i dottori\nl'amico entrando alla (mia) porta venne; H. bah\u016bt din bite r\u0101j\u0101 phir gaye, It. passati molti d\u00ec il re and\u00f2 nuovamente. This use of the past part., however, is not found in Fr. It is remarked by Diez that of all the modern languages of Europe the English is most in accord with the Romance usage in the foregoing respects. The personal pronouns are not generally required in either group to express the person of the verb, but they are often added for emphasis or for no apparent reason. Modern Fr. is an exception, as in this language it is only in the 2nd sing. and 1st and 2nd pl. of the imperative that the pronouns can be dispensed with.\nArt. XIV.\u2014On the Uzbeg Epos.\u2014By Arminius Vambery.\n\nI have to remark before all, that the manuscript referring to Sheibani Khan, upon which I am speaking, ought not to be confounded with the Sheibani-nameh, edited by the Russian Orientalist K. Berezin, in 1849, in I. Biblioteka Vostochnikh Historikof. The last-named is an insignificant little treatise of the deeds accomplished by the famous Uzbeg chief, and may be divided into two different parts. The first, containing one of those numerous compilations of the history of the Turks, must be ranked amongst the third class of imitators of Ala-eddin Djuveini and of Rashid-eddin Tabibi, with the only exception that the anonymous author, being probably of Turkish origin, has less disfigured the Turkish and Mongol nomina propria than many of his predecessors and subsequent writers upon the same subject. In the second part the author dwells at some length upon that branch of the Djenghizides of which Abulkhair Khan, the ancestor of Sheibani, was an offspring\u2014I mean to say upon the family of Djudji Khan, and here we meet with certain details and genealogical data not to be met with in most of the books treating the same subject. Of a particular value seems to us the account given of the Kungrat tribe, of its division into a right and left wing, and of the foremost princes of that tribe. In the third part mention is made of the family of Abulkhair Khan and of their migration to Turkestan, which was in that time under the rule of the Timuride Sultan Ahmed Mirza, on which occasion Sheibani Mehemmed Khan, the son of Budag Shah and grandson of Abulkhair Khan, appears in the foreground as a conqueror. The exploits of this hero, and his struggles against the lords of Samarkand, as well as against the children of Mirza Husein Balkara, are related merely in\noutline, so that the whole history of the founder of the Sheibani dynasty scarcely extends over twelve pages, and does not conform with the much promising title of \"The History of Sheibani Khan.\"\n\nThe manuscript upon which I am speaking is entirely different, as far as regards its context, as well as the form in which it is brought before us. It is a regular Epos, in which the deeds of Sheibani Mehemmed Khan are glorified in seventy-four cantos, containing upwards of 4300 distichons in the metre of the Medjnoun u Leila of Djami, and of other poetical compositions of the East. Considering the almost general belief that the poetical form of Epopee is only common to the Arian and Semitic races of mankind,\u2014for the epic character of the Kalevala has been the subject of frequent discussion,\u2014it is certainly highly interesting to see this egotistical theory overthrown by the present example; for admitting that the Uzbeg poem before us be much inferior with regard to its poetical value to other Persian similar compositions, we must nevertheless acknowledge the full rights of this Turkish poem to the title of Epos. This fact was the first which attracted my attention towards this manuscript, and which suggested to me the idea to publish the text in company with the translation of the whole poem. I shall first give you a short outline of the contents, and then proceed to the definition of the historical, ethnographical, geographical, and linguistical importance of the work.\n\nThe first three cantos contain the usual praises and salutations to Allah and Mohammed, whilst from the fourth to the fifteenth the moral and physical qualities of the hero are described, together with the superiority of his arms and armour. Then follows an account of the reason which induced the author to write the poem\u2014a canto which is valuable as to biographical data of the poet himself; and it is only in the seventeenth canto that the historical relation commences, from the time, namely, when Sheibani was first marching upon Samarkand, ruled in that time by Baki Terkhan, when he opened, so to say, the long series of\nconquests, the illustration and glorification of which forms the subject of the whole work. To these conquests belong the successful engagements of the Uzbeg chief with the Timurides in Transoxania, in which the struggles of Baber take a prominent part; particularly in the account given of the siege of Samarkand, and of the troubles which the founder of the Mogul dynasty in India had to suffer from the hands of his triumphant rival. After the expulsion of Baber, and the total downfall of the rule of the Mirzas (as the Timurides are called) in Transoxania, which led also to the defeat of the Mongol relatives and auxiliaries of Baber, such as Khanke Khan and his younger brother Aladja Khan, Sheibani crosses the Oxus and enters upon the long war, partly with the children of Mirza Hussein Baikara, partly with Khosru Shah, the lord of Kuhistan, a name which comprised at those times Bedakhshan, Khatlan, Dervaz, Roshan, and Shignan. After the defeat and death of this Turkish Prince, Sheibani concludes the previously entered campaign against Kharezm, where a certain Tehin Sofi, the chief of the mighty tribe of the Ada-Turkomans, made such a staunch resistance, that the Uzbeg conqueror, besides suffering heavy losses, had to besiege the capital of the said country for nearly eleven months. All the officers and relatives of Sheibani had already lost their patience, and only the undauntable perseverance of the chief had brought ultimately the fortress to fall.\n\nWith this episode the author concludes his poem, without being able to follow his hero to the culminating point of his career, comprising, as sufficiently known, his conquest of Khorasan and his capture of Herat in 1507, equivalent to 918 A.H. Considering that the campaign against Kharezm can have only happened somewhere about 910 or 911, i.e. 1505 A.D., and that the Epos begins only with the appearance of Sheibani before Samarkand in 906 (1500), we have but the comparatively short period of five years, the events of which are related, as may be easily imagined, with trifling incidents and minute details, and not without a prolixity which becomes often very tiresome to the reader. As to\nthe reason why the author has brought his work to such an early conclusion, we cannot account otherwise than his being forcibly obliged to do so in consequence of premature death, which may have reached him in some of the subsequent battles, for he was not only a poet, but he took also an active part in the campaigns of Sheibani as an officer of rank, as we shall see afterwards.\n\nFrom what we said in reference to the extension of the text, it must be apparent that the historical events related are brought before us in such details, and with such episodes, which neither Baber nor Mirkhond, nor the Tarikhi Rashidi used by Erskine, and still less the previously mentioned Sheibani-nameh of Berezin, can possibly give us. The author was evidently an eye-witness of almost all the events which form the subject of his poetical composition; and if through his quality of a court poet we find his muse too frequently engaged in excessive flatteries, we have, on the other hand, the benefit of such historical data which none of the chroniclers of that time had either the opportunity or the will to notice. It is particularly the Memoirs of Baber which suffer greatly in a confrontation with the data found in the manuscript before us; for, in spite of the greatness of the character of the founder of the Mogol Dynasty, we discover that he viewed matters and recorded events in such a light, upon which the stamp of partiality, sometimes also of intentional misrepresentation, is frequently apparent. It is, briefly spoken, the only genuine Uzbeg account of the first wars of Sheibani in Transoxania, an account which has evidently been unknown even to Abulgazi, who, although animated by the desire to do justice to his kinsman, has nevertheless followed in his book only the information laid down by such Persian or Tchagatai writers, who were enemies to the grandson of Abulkhair Khan.\n\nIt needs scarcely to be said, that the often remarked prolixity of the text must obviously bear also upon the ethnographical importance of the work, in so far as we get a deep insight into the life and into the military customs and manners of those warriors who, pouring down from the\nUpper Yaxtartes valley upon the southern part of Central Asia, have been depicted to us by the contemporary writers as rude savages and horrid barbarians. I must confess that this impression is not much weakened by reading the descriptions of the poet, who represents nomadic rudeness in the light of valour and military virtue; but he affords us also the best opportunity to learn all the details of their exterior life, such as their military institutions and tactics, their dresses and arms; while, by enumerating the objects taken during the pillage in the various surrounding countries, we get a glimpse of the interior life of such parts of Central Asia as have been until quite recently shut up to European travellers. Not less interesting is the picture of the ethnic constellations of that time, when the generic name of Uzbeg was just coming into the foreground. We get acquainted with the single Mongol and Turkish tribes, which, as the partisans of Sheibani, formed the nucleus of his army, and amalgamating with the Turkish inhabitants of the three Khanates, have constituted that reigning Turkish element known to-day under the name of Uzbeg. As for the scanty geographical information which we derive from the description of the marches of the Uzbeg army in the various directions, I shall mention the ways leading to Bedakhshan, Vakhsh, and Shignan, particularly the highly interesting fact, that the author uses the name of \u00d6k\u00fcz, or \u00dcgh\u00fcz, in speaking of the Oxus below Termez, and what may mostly surprise, of his alluding to the main branch of the \u00d6k\u00fcz flowing in a south-westerly direction from Tchardjui, a place which must have been in that time not on the left, but on the right bank of the river, supporting, at the same time, the theory of Sir Henry Rawlinson with reference to the former course of a branch of the Oxus flowing in a more southern direction from the present one, and passing close to Urgendj, invariably called in that time Kharezm. There are, besides, a few minor details of geographical knowledge, regarding which I beg to refer to the notes accompanying the text.\n\nIn viewing the linguistical and poetical value of the\nmanuscript before us, I must remark beforehand, that the author is much inferior to Mir Ali Shir as far as regards the elegance, the vigour, and the artistical finish of the composition. A somewhat severe critic may even style him merely a clever versificator; ample faults may be found with the tiresome prolixity, with the frequent repetition of poetical metaphors, and particularly with the not rarely occurring flatulence of the style; but we must consider that the author, by describing the events of scarcely five years in 8620 verses, could have hardly avoided falling into these errors. In his quality of an Oriental court-poet, whose chief duty consists in excessive flatteries, he found himself in the necessity to represent his hero, who was decried by his Chagatai rivals as a rude barbarian, not only as a great conqueror and intrepid warrior, but also as the prototype of culture and refinement, and therefore he was obliged to fill up the gap by the exertions of his muse. In order to give to the reader an idea of the Epos before us, I shall give a few specimens in translation, as far as my un-English pen is able to do it.\n\nCANTO 17.\n\nAs soon as the morning star became visible,\nThe Khan was found ready for the start.\nHe mounted his horse to meet Baki Tarkhan,\nHaving directed his army towards the fortress.\nWhilst riding, this prince of his time\nHad called me and said: \"Oh! thou homeless,\nHow long is it since thy father died,\nThat his family and relatives have been scattered?\"\nI answered: \"It is thirty years, my lord,\nThat my soul is burning with sorrow.\"\nWhereupon this prince, with his life-reviving lips,\nRemarked: \"Forty years have elapsed\nFrom the time that my father died, and see,\nGrief has gone, Fortune has turned towards me.\nThy time of distress, O orphan,\nWill now end, and happiness will come;\nHaving now associated to our cause,\nAnd knowing our intentions as thou dost,\"\nCome on! keep with unshaken truth on our side,\nDo never descend from the path of equity.\"\nHe thus rejoiced me with words of grace,\nDelivering me from pangs and anxiety.\nThus moved the Khan, the Suleiman of his age,\nUnrelentingly towards the army of Baki.\nOne station making, the fortress came in sight,\nAnd the environs of that place were reached.\n\nExtract from Canto 28, containing a speech of Baber:\n\nThe inhabitants of the town having finished their word,\nMirza Baber could hardly retain himself,\nAnd, weeping, he said, \"May God bless you;\nMay He lend strength and assistance to you!\nIt is you who have seen my ancestors,\nYou who have witnessed my glory and my rank.\nNearly a century has passed away\nThat my forefather, the world-conquering Timur,\nThis righteous and mighty prince, has died.\nAlas! many people have forgotten him since;\nBut if he be gone, remember his present offspring.\nAsk from those who have seen him,\nWhat kind of a prince Sultan Said was;\nThe man who died a martyr in Karabag!\nThat was my grandfather. My poor father,\nWho emptied the cup of martyrdom at Andijan,\nWas the noted chief Shah Omar Sheikh,\nA man whose sword produced torrents of blood;\nWhilst my uncle, so much favoured by God,\nWas Sultan Ahmed, a king, defender of the faith.\nHe was born and grew up in this town,\nBorn and grew up in a glorious epoch;\nHe ruled forty years long over this country,\nA prince known of wisdom in this country.\nAll of you are contemporaries of his;\nYou are the men who have witnessed his bounty;\nYou ought now to remember these princes,\u2014\nThese princes, unequalled in their ruling skill;\nAnd in veneration for their memory\nYou should now exert yourself on my behalf.\nYou may thus gladden their departed souls,\nAnd relieve myself from pining anxiety.\nPray! don't forsake me in this place,\nDon't let me burn in the flame of distress.\"\n\nExtract from Canto 42, in which a march against the Mongols is related:\n\nWhen the Khan, passing Dizzak, had gone into camp,\nHe directed his orders to Shah Mahmud,\nTo proceed with his army and to cross the river\nCalled Sir, at a place fraught with danger,\nTo surprise the Mongols at Shahrukhie,\nAnd to infest the routes of Shash and Seiram,\nIn order to destroy the hordes of the Mongols,\nAnd to extirpate them from the surface of the earth.\nIt is with this order that Sultan Mahmud\nStarted, bestowing praises upon his brother.\nWith him went also Timur Sultan,\nWhose face was radiant like the sun.\nHadji Ghazi was likewise a companion\nBent upon the destruction of the Mongols;\nDjanvefa Bi went also with them,\nBurning with desire to kill the Mongols.\nSo also did Kamber Bi join the party,\nImploring the help and grace of God;\nWhilst the brave and spirited Sheikh Murid\nWas gladly mixing in the marching ranks.\nThey all started, guided by the Sultan,\nFaithfully obedient to his commands.\nOf six thousand men consisted that party,\nRecruited from the left and from the right wing,\nAll of them brave warriors, longing for the fight,\nAll standing upright in search of the enemy,\nAll of them mounted upon quick and fiery steeds,\nAll keeping in perfect readiness their arms;\nClad in heavy armour were their horses;\nTheir own inner and outer dresses richly fringed with furs.\nThe garments of one were made of sable skin,\nLending him a fiery appearance whilst marching;\nAnother was dressed in marten skins,\nON THE UZBEG EPOS.\n\nFairly adjusting himself to the weather;\nWhilst a third, being wrapt in fox skins,\nWas continually clinging to the foxes.\nErmine and black sable were their under garments.\nReally, what can I further say of them?\nIt was such a bitter cold, that good and bad\nWere likewise complaining of its effect.\nAlbeit, the Uzbeg people born in the Steppes,\nAnd accustomed to the inclemency of weather,\nAlthough they experienced so many frosts,\nAnd were hardened to the roughness of climate,\nThey still cried in amazement, \"Oh wonder!\nWhat is the desert's winter compared with this cold?\"\n\nIf I had not to contend with the difficulty of the language, I would gladly augment the number of the specimens; but the samples given will I suppose suffice to form an idea of the style, as well as of the language the author uses, whose Turkish, extremely plain and unartificial, reminds us very much of the Turkish of later popular poets of Central Asia, such as Bidil, Meshreb, Allahyar, Fuzuli, and essentially different from the artistic language used by Nevai in his Chihar-Divan, Khamset ul Mutakhirin, and other great compositions. I may here incidentally remark, that the literary monuments which have been known to us as the Anthology of Chagatai literature, in which the Kulliati Nevai occupies the foremost rank, are preferentially the product of such beaux-esprits, who, living out of Transoxania proper, particularly in Eastern Khorassan, have been brought up under the influence of that cultural movement in Herat, which rose to a high degree under the Timuride from Shahrukh till after the death of Mirza Husein Baikara, and which culminated in the school of Molla Abdurrahman Djami. This cultural light, being strictly Iranian, must have roused very early the national jealousy of the Turks, who, in spite of the utmost reverence shown to their Persian teachers, could scarcely bear the humiliating position in which they, as the ruling class, were brought by the governed, i.e. Persian element. To such feelings must be traced the origin of the\nMuhakemet-ul-Lugatein (i.e. The trial of the two languages), by Nevai, in which treatise the great Turkish statesman and poet engaged in comparative studies of the Turkish and Persian languages, proving to the reader the superiority of the Turkish over the Persian, particularly in reference to the surpassing richness and to the admirable flexibility of his vernacular. It was mainly in the interest of this question of rivalry that the extraordinary literary efforts of Nevai must be ascribed, efforts the result of which may have succeeded in satisfying the national vanity of the Timuride ruling class, or the Chagatai lords, as they were inappropriately called, but which contributed little or nothing towards the enlightenment of the continually shifting Turkish elements on the right bank of the Oxus. Here, where the settled Turks were continually intermixing with the nomadic warriors coming down from the north, the refined language of Nevai, and of other contemporary writers, was always looked upon as foreign, whilst their own idiomatic Turkish, called the Uzbeg, in correspondence with the ethnico-political division of that time, was cherished and pre-eminently cultivated as the more national dialect, and better adapted to the intellectual capacity of the new immigrants from the Steppes. This distinction between the Chagatai and Uzbeg Turkish continued to exist also in the subsequent centuries, for we read in Abulghazi (p. 37, text edited by Desmaisons, St. Petersbourg, 1874) the following sentence:\n\n\"\u0628\u0631 \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e\u06cc \u0628\u062e\u0634\u06cc \u0648 \u0628\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0631\u062c\u0647 \u0627\u0632\u06cc \u067e\u06cc\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0646 \u062a\u06cc\u067e \u062a\u0631\u06a9\u06cc \u062a\u0628\u0644\u06cc\n\n\u0628\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u06cc\u062f\u0645\u06cc\u0645 \u062a\u0631\u06a9\u06cc \u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0632 \u0627\u06cc\u062a\u06cc\u0628 \u0645\u06cc \u06a9\u06cc\u0645 \u0628\u06cc\u0634 \u0628\u0627\u0634\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0648\u063a\u0644\u0627\u0646\n\n\u062a\u0648\u0634\u0648\u0646\u0631 \u0628\u06cc\u0633\u0631 \u06a9\u0644\u0645\u0647 \u062c\u063a\u0646\u0627\u0647\u06cc \u062a\u0631\u06a9\u06cc \u0633\u0646\u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u0648 \u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u06cc\u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u0648 \u0639\u0631\u0628\u06cc \u062f\u06cc\u0646\n\n\u062a\u0648\u0631\u0634\u0645\u0627\u0647\u06cc \u0645\u0646 \u0631\u0648\u0634\u0646 \u067e\u06cc\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0646 \u062a\u06cc\u067e\n\ni.e. \"in order to make comprehensible this history to all classes of people, I have used the Turkish language, and such a Turkish which is within the reach of a boy five years\nold, having avoided for the sake of clearness to mix any Chagatai-Turkish, Arabic and Persian word.\"\n\nFrom the above it will become apparent that nearly two hundred years after the date of the manuscript before us, the Chagatai-Turki was still classified together with the Persian and Arabic, and declared to be a dialect not accessible to the understanding of every Turk. Admitting that this statement of Abulghazi is somewhat exaggerated, for the difference between the two dialects is by no means such a considerable one, we nevertheless get the conviction that the Chagatai of Nevai had always in the Khanates the zest of foreignness, and has consequently never enjoyed the general favour of the reading public. With reference to the text of the Epos before us, it would be hardly admissible that the author was led by the same puristic tendencies of which Abulghazi speaks, for he makes ample use of certain Persian poetical expressions, but on the whole his style is plain and unadorned; and his work, originally written for the Uzbegs, is thoroughly adapted to the cultural standing of the Turks of Central Asia of those times, and is also comprehensible to the present generation, which cannot be said of the Kulliat Nevai.\n\nAs to the author himself, we have two sources referring to biographical data, one the Memoirs of Baber, and secondly the information laid down in the Epos. From the introductory chapters of this last we learn that the author's name was Prince Mehemmed Salih, of Kharezm, and that he was the son of Mir Said, who formerly ruled in Kharezm, but who, having lost his throne in consequence of turbulent events, was obliged to take refuge at Merv, where he died, as may be seen from the following verses:\u2014\n\n\u0645\u0648\u062f\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u062a\u06cc\u06a9\u0647 \u062e\u062f\u0627\u062f\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u062a\u0642\u062f\u06cc\u0631 \u062c\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0626\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u06cc\u0634\u06cc\u06a9\u0627 \u0628\u06cc\u0631\u062f\u06cc \u062a\u063a\u06cc\u06cc\u0631\n\u062c\u06cc\u0642\u06cc\u062a\u06cc \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0632\u0645 \u062f\u06cc\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u0642\u0648\u0644\u06cc\u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u06cc\u0648\u0642 \u0648 \u06a9\u0627\u062a \u062d\u0635\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u0642\u0648\u0644\u06cc\u062f\u06cc\u0646\n\u062a\u0648\u0634\u06cc \u0627\u0646\u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u0630\u0631\u0628\u06cc \u0633\u0631\u0648\u0645\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u0646\u062f\u0627 \u0633\u0627\u0648\u0631\u0648\u0644\u062f\u06cc \u0627\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0644\u06cc \u0628\u0627\u0631\u06cc\n\u0627\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u062f\u06cc \u0646\u0648\u0634 \u0634\u0647\u0627\u062f\u062a \u062c\u0627\u0645\u06cc \u0627\u0646\u06a9\u0627\u0646\u0648\u0634 \u0627\u0648\u0644\u062f\u06cc \u0633\u0639\u0627\u062f\u062a \u062c\u0627\u0645\u06cc\nThe poet says: \"When through the decision of God, my father's fate took a bad turn; when the country of Kharezm left his hand; when losing the fortresses Khivuk and Ket, he was obliged to retire towards Merv, where his family and his relatives were scattered about: it was here that he emptied the cup of martyrdom; for him it was the cup of happiness.\" The author relates further: \"Now driven by the vicissitudes of life he strayed from one place to another, until, finally crossing the Oxus, at the time when Sheibani appeared before Samarkand, he very soon got acquainted with that Prince, nay, became the favourite and court-poet of his, remaining at his side during all the time, and in all the campaigns which form the subject of this poem.\" Sheibani, who, in accordance with the ruling tone of those times, also indulged in poetry, seems to have taken a particular fancy for Mehemmed Salih, for he employed him in various confidential missions, entrusting him even with the command of Tehardjui at the critical moment, when, marching upon Kharezm, the army of Mirza Hussein intended to bar the way. The poet behaved valiantly in the defence of that place, and earned the full praises of his master. After the conquest of Kharezm, which is the concluding canto of the Epos, Mehemmed Salih must have died in one of the battles, as we previously noted, for in the Memoirs of Baber he is quoted as a man of the past. Baber, in mentioning the chief men of his time, alludes to our poet in the following words (Text, p. 227):\n\n\u06cc\u0646\u0647 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0645\u0627\u062c \u0627\u06cc\u062f\u06cc \u0686\u0627\u0634\u0646\u06cc \u0644\u0628\u06cc \u063a\u0632\u0644 \u0644\u0627\u06cc \u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u06a9\u0631\u062c\u0647 \u0647\u0645\u0648\u0627\u0631\n\u0644\u06cc\u063a\u06cc \u0686\u0627\u0634\u0646\u06cc \u0633\u06cc \u062c\u0647 \u0628\u0648\u062a\u0648\u0646 \u062a\u0631\u06a9\u06cc \u0634\u0639\u0631\u06cc \u0647\u0645 \u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0628\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u06cc\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u062f\u0648\u0631\n\u0633\u0648\u0646\u06a9\u0631\u0627 \u0634\u06cc\u0628\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u062e\u0627\u0646 \u0642\u0627\u0647\u0634\u0646\u06af\u0647 \u06a9\u0644\u0628\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u062f\u06cc \u0641 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0644\u0647 \u0631\u0639\u0627\u064a\u062a \u062a\u06cc\u0644\u06cc\u0628\n\u0627\u06cc\u062f\u06cc \u0634\u06cc\u0628\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u062e\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u062a\u06cc\u0642\u0647 \u0628\u06cc\u0631 \u062a\u0631\u06a9\u06cc \u0645\u062b\u0646\u0648\u06cc \u0628\u06cc\u062a\u06cc\u0628 \u062f\u0648\u0631 \u0645\u062c\u0646\u0648\u0646 \u0648\u0632\u0646\u06cc\u062f\u0627\n\u06a9\u06cc\u0645 \u0633\u0627\u062d\u0647 \u0648\u0632\u0646\u06cc \u0628\u0644\u063a\u0627\u06cc \u0628\u0633\u06cc\u0627\u0631 \u0633\u0633\u062a \u0648 \u0641\u0631\u062f \u062f\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u0648\u0698\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u06cc\u0634\u06cc\n\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0645\u0627\u062c \u0646\u06cc\u06a9 \u0634\u0631\u06cc\u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u0644\u06cc \u0627\u0639\u062a\u0642\u0627\u062f \u0628\u0648\u0644\u0648\u0631 \u0628\u06cc\u0631 \u0628\u062e\u0634\u06cc \u0628\u06cc\u0634\u06cc \u0628\u0648\u062f\u0648\u0631\nON THE UZBEG EPOS.\n\ni.e. \"There was besides Mehemmed Salih, an author of tasteful ghazels, in which the fluency was not adequate to the poetical skill. He wrote also Turkish poetry, which was not at all bad. He went afterwards to Sheibani, who held him in esteem, and it was upon the name of this prince that he composed a Mesnevi, in the metre of Medjnoun, the same as the metre of Subhat (Subhat ul Abrar of Djami), which is however a very weak and inferior work, and makes the reader despair of the *vena poetica* of its author. One of the better verses is the following:\n\nFergana became the home of Tembel,\nThus making Fergana a Tembel khane.\n\nAn allusion to Endidjan, ironically called a Tembel khane (the home of idlers). There is not another verse as good as this in the whole Mesnevi. Mehemmed Salih himself was a wicked man, of a despotic and merciless nature.\"\n\nI need scarcely say, that this evidently too severe and at all events unjust criticism comes from the pen of the chief enemy of Sheibani, and that we cannot subscribe to it in all details; but as far as regards the poetical value of the Epos, we have already expressed our agreement with the Caesar of the East, as Pavet de Courteille deservedly calls the great founder of the Mogol dynasty of India. Of course our object in view in copying and translating the whole poem was not the poetical value, but rather the historical, geographical, and ethnographical details, which, considering the dearth of information upon that highly interesting epoch of Central Asia, are well deserving the attention of Orientalists.\n\nThe manuscript, the property of the Imperial Library of Vienna, and written in a very clear Taalik hand, upon two\nhundred and eighteen double pages, bears upon the last page the date of 916 (1510), and must be therefore regarded as one of the earliest copies, written shortly before the death of Sheibani, and only a short time after the death of the author. The copy before us, which I may call the only one existing in Europe, contains besides nine coloured illustrations, representing partly sieges and battles, partly feasts. These, however, are of a posterior date, for we find there also firearms, of which no mention is made in the text, and quite appropriately, considering that it was only Shah Ismael Sefi who introduced guns into Central Asia; the Uzbegs had no notion of this weapon. The first mention of the existence of this manuscript is made by Fl\u00fcgel in his Catalogue of the Arabic-Persian and Turkish Manuscripts of the Imperial Library of Vienna, in vol. ii. p. 323, but in a totally erroneous statement, owing to the unacquaintance with the Eastern Turkish dialect of this otherwise illustrious German Orientalist.\nART. XV.\u2014On the Separate Edicts at Dhauli and Jaugada.\n\nBy Professor H. Kern.\n\nGeneral Cunningham's Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum, a real boon to all who are directing their attention to the study of Indian antiquity, contains amongst other revised copies those of the separate edicts at Dhauli and Jaugada. Owing to important corrections introduced into the text, much of what formerly was utterly unintelligible has become tolerably clear. It cannot be denied that many difficulties are left; but the greater their number, the more it would seem desirable that those who have studied these interesting documents should make public the results of their labours.\n\nThe object of this paper is to give the text of the two edicts in transcription, followed by a Sanskrit translation, intended as a kind of running commentary and a substitute for a glossary, and by an English version. The double text of each edict will be found side by side in separate columns. In accordance with a remark made by General Cunningham (Corp. Inscr. p. 20) about the relative positions of the two edicts on the Jaugada rock, the inscription standing as No. 2 in Prinsep's arrangement of the separate edicts at Dhauli will be treated first.\n\nDHAULI II.\n\n[1] Dev\u00e1nampiyasa vacanena Tosaliya kum\u0101le mah\u0101m\u0101t\u0101 ca vataviya am kichi dakh\u0101mi hakam tam-\n\n[2] duv\u0101late ca \u0101labbeham esa ca me mokhiyamata-duv\u0101l\u0101 (r. \"le\") etasi athasi am tupahe (hi anusathi save munis\u0101 pa\u1e6da) mama [3] atha pa\u1e6d\u0101ye ich\u0101mi hakam niti (r. kimti) savena hitasukhena\n\nJAUGADA I.\n\n[1] Dev\u00e1nampiyeva hevam \u0101ha Sam\u0101p\u0101ya mah\u0101m\u0101t\u0101 lajava-canika (r. l\u0101javacanik\u0101) vataviy\u0101 am kichi dakh\u0101mi hakam tam ich\u0101mi hakam kankame\u1e47nam (r. kankam ena) [2] patip\u0101tayeham duvalate ca \u0101labbeham esa ca me mokhiyamata duv\u0101le etas(i) athas(i) am tupahehi anusathi savamanu[3]s\u0101 me pa\u1e6da atha pa\u1e6d\u0101ye\nhidalokap\u00e1lalokik\u00e1ye yujey\u00fa-ti hevam manasa (r. manasi, [4] siy\u00e1 ant\u00e1 nama (r. kant\u00e1, or ka me) vijit\u00e1nam kichanva (r. kimchande) su l\u00e1j\u00e1 (aphes\u00fa-ti etaka) meva icha mim\u00e1 (r. ich\u00e1 mama) am te su (kham) p\u00e1punevu-te (r. p\u00e1pu-nev\u00fa-ti) iti Dev\u00e1nampiy\u00e9 (ichati anu) v\u00e1g\u00e1s (r. anuvig\u00e1na) ma-m\u00e1ye [5] huv\u00e9v\u00fa-ti asavseva ca sukhampeva lahevam mame no dukham hevam\u2014nava (r. j\u00e1nenu) [iti] khami(s)a[ji] [ne] Dev\u00e1nampiy\u00e9 ah\u00e1k\u00e1-ti e cakiye kha-mitave mama nimitam ca dhama-pa caley\u00fa-ti [6] hidalokap\u00e1lalo-kam ca \u00e1l\u00e1dhay\u00e9v\u00fa etasi athasi hakam anus\u00e1s\u00e1mi tupa anena etakena hakam anus\u00e1s\u00edtam chandam ca veditam \u00e1hay\u00e1mi pati\u00f1\u00e1 ca mama [7] aj\u00e1l\u00e1 sa hevam kat\u00fa kamme calitaviye asv\u00e1(s\u00e1bh\u00edt\u00e1) ni cat\u00e1ni (r. cit\u00e1ni?) ena p\u00e1pu-nev\u00fa iti atha pit\u00e1 tath\u00e1 Dev\u00e1nampiy\u00e9 aph\u00e1ka atha ca at\u00e1nam hevam Dev\u00e1nampiy\u00e9 anusampati aphe [8] ath\u00e1 ca paja hevam maye Dev\u00e1nampiyasa se hakam anus\u00e1sita chandam ca (vedita tu)p\u00e1h\u00e1 des\u00e1vutike hos\u00e1mi et\u00e1-ye \u00e1th\u00e1ye pa\u1e6dib\u00e1l\u00e1 hi tupa as-vasan\u00e1ye hitsukh\u00e1ye ca tasa [9] hidalokap\u00e1lalokik\u00e1ye hevam ca kalamtam tupa svagam \u00e1l\u00e1dhay\u00e1-satha mama ca \u00e1naniy\u00e1m cha-tha et\u00e1ye ca \u00e1th\u00e1ye iyam lipi likhit\u00e1 hida ena mah\u00e1m\u00e1t\u00e1 svasatam (r. sasvatam) samam (r.\n\n* The words in brackets are a repetition, with additional blunders, of what is found in l. 9.

Now the means (or, intermediacy) I esteem to be the most capital in this matter, is to give instructions to you. All subjects are my children; as for my own children I wish that they may be possessed of every benefit and happiness for this world and the next. It is also my wish, should people think, wheresoever in my domaine: \u2018How is the king (or, the good king) intentioned towards us?\u2019 that they should know me to have no other wish but that they may obtain happiness. Dev\u0101nampriya wishes that they may be unafraid of me and be easy and receive happiness only, no suffering at my hands. They may persuade themselves that Dev\u0101nampriya will pardon them whatsoever\n\n\u00b9 Amta, standing for atta, is P\u0101li atta, Skr. asta, but here obviously used in the sense of the compound nyasta.\n\u00b2 Solavaya is properly Skr. c\u0101ravayya.\n\u00b3 C\u0101gh (c\u0101gh\u0101) \u201cto wish,\u201d c\u0101gh\u0101 c\u0101h\u0101, also occurs in the Pillar edict No. 4: \u201cyena ca r\u0101j\u0101k\u0101 \u015b\u0101nti \u015b\u0101nti al\u0101dhayitave,\u201d i.e. \u201cby which the governors will propitiate me.\u201d Quite like to will in English, \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0646 in New-Persian, we see c\u0101gh used to form a future tense.\n\n\u00b9 In Jaugada text: \u201cDev\u0101nampriya says: \u2018the magistrates royal commissioners at Sam\u0101p\u0101 should be informed\u2014...\u2019.\u201d\n\u00b2 Jaug.: \u201cThe King.\u201d\n\nvol. xii.\u2014[NEW SERIES.]\ncan be performed, and they may work righteousness for my sake and propitiate this world and the next. To this end I give you instructions; by this much I desire my instruction (to you) and my intention to be made known (to the public). And my resolution is firm. Let those who be acted in such a way that they (the people) will be easy and unafraid in their minds (rar. r. they will get easy in mind and body), (thinking): 'Like a father, so is Dev\u00e1nampriya to us; and as he is tending himself, so he is tending us; and like his own children, so are we to Dev\u00e1nampriya.' Therefore I desire my instruction and my intention to be made known (to the public). To this purpose I will entrust the country to your care, for you are able to promote its quietness, its weal and happiness in this world and the next. And by doing so, you will win heaven and acquit yourselves of your duty against me. And for this sake has this edict been written here, that the magistrates for all time may exert themselves to promote the quietness and virtuous conduct of those entrusted to them. And this edict shall be read every four months at the (festival of the) asterism Tishya, and, at pleasure, on any other solemn occasion apart from Tishya. By doing so, you will do your due.\"\n\nAbout the name of the city Tosali little is to be added to what has been already remarked by Lassen in Indische Alterthumskunde, vol. iii. p. 159. He points out that the Tosali mentioned by Ptolemy, vii. 2, 73 sq., cannot be identified with A\u00e7oka's Tosali, on account of the difference in site. General Cunningham comes to the same conclusion (Corp. Inscr. p. 16). Even if we are willing to accept Ptolemy's statement as a correct one, it does not follow that Tosali in Katak should mean anything else but the \"capital of the people called Tosalas.\" There may have been two divisions of the same people inhabiting different tracts of country. This much is certain, that the Tosalas, Tosalus as the name of a people are known from Sanskrit\n\n1 Jaug.: \"Resolution of my mind.\"\nsources, viz. Toshala in Harivan\u00e7a 4736; the form Toshalaka 4734, 4741. Tosala occurs in a Pari\u00e7ishta of the Atharva Veda, extracts from which are given by Prof. Weber in his Catalogue of the Berlin Sanskrit Manuscripts. In the passage alluded to the Tosalas are enumerated in connexion with the Ven\u0101tatas, the people living on the banks of the Ven\u0101 river, which goes far to prove that the people in Katak is meant. The t in Tosali is, it may be supposed, a mere variety of the feminine ending \u0101, by which, from stems in a, are derived words denoting the capital of a country or district. Thus Ko\u00e7al\u0101 means the \u201ccapital of Ko\u00e7alaland (Ayodhy\u0101).\u201d Stems in i show regularly t when the city is meant; e.g. Avant\u012b is the capital of the Avantayas, the Avanti-people; Ka\u00e7i of the K\u0101\u00e7ayas, Ka\u00e7i-land.\n\nThe Prince, to whom conjointly with the magistrates the royal rescript is addressed, and who consequently at the time must have been residing in Tosali, is not mentioned in the head of the following edict. On the other hand we learn from that document that the Prince, or, at any rate, a Prince, had then his residence in Ujjayini. These facts lead us to the assumption that the Prince of both edicts is one and the same person, and that during the lapse of time between the date of the first and the second edict he had been promoted from the rank of governor of Tosali to the same position in Ujjayini. The text of the second edict is as follows:\n\n**DHAULI I.**\n\n[1] Dev\u0101nampiyasa vacanena Tosaliyan mah\u0101m\u0101ta (r. \"t\u0101\") nagalaviyoh\u0101laka (r. \"k\u0101\") [2] vata-viyam (r. \"y\u0101\") am kichi dakh\u0101mi hakam tam ich\u0101mi kiinti amnam e(na) patived\u0101yeham (r. \"dayeham\") [3] duv\u0101late ca \u0101labheham esa ca me mokhiyamata duv\u0101le etasi athasi am tuphesi [4] anusathi tuppe hi bah\u016bsu p\u0101nasahasesu \u0101yaya (r. \u0101yut\u0101)\n\n**JAUGADA I.**\n\n[1] Dev\u0101nampiyae hevam \u0101ha Sam\u0101p\u0101yam mah\u0101m\u0101ta nagle viyoh\u0101lak\u0101 he(vam) vataviy\u0101 am kichi d\u0101v\u0101mi (r. dakh\u0101mi) hamnam (r. tamp)-tam ich\u0101mi kiinti a(mnam) ona patived\u0101yeham (r. \"dayeham\") [2] duv\u0101late ca \u0101labheha esa ca me mokhiyamate duv\u0101le am tuphesu anusathi (tuphe hi bahuse p\u0101nasahasesu) . . . . . . . . . . . . gave\npana(?)(r.jane) me gave(r.gache)-ma sumunis\u0101nam save[5] munise p\u0101j\u0101 mam\u0101 atha pa-j\u0101ye ich\u0101mi hakapasa[6]p\u0101lalokik\u0101ye yujeyu-ti (hevam eva save)u pi ich\u0101mi dukam no ca p\u0101pun\u0101tha \u0101v\u0101ga[7]make iyam atha keca ekapulise man\u0101ti etam se pi dosam no savam dekhate hi tuophe etam[8] su vihit\u0101 pi(r.hi) niti(r.kinti) iyam ekapulise ath\u0101ya bandhanam v\u0101 palikileseam v\u0101 p\u0101pun\u0101ti tata hota[9] akasam\u0101te na bandhan\u0101 t\u0101ka(r.take) amne ca bahujano(r.bahujane) daviye dukhyati tata ichitaviye[10] tupehi kinti majham patip\u0101dayem\u0101-ti imehi cu j\u0101tehi no sampatipajati is\u0101ya \u0101sulopena(r.losena)[11] nithuliyaena t\u016blan\u0101ya an\u0101vutya al\u0101siyena k\u0101lamathena se ichitaviye kinti ete[12] j\u0101t\u0101ni(no) huvevu mam\u0101-ti etasa ca savasa mule an\u0101sulope(r.lose) at\u016blan\u0101 ca niticham(r.nitiyan) e kilamte siy\u0101[13] na to(r.tena) uga(m) samcalitaviye[m] tuva-hitaviye(r.tuv\u0101hitaviye?) etaviye v\u0101 hova[m]meva[m] edam tuph\u0101ka tema vatav\u012bye[14] aganam(r.arganam) ne dekhata(r.dekhati) hevam ca ho[m]yam ca Dev\u0101nampiyasa anusathi se mah\u0101(pha)sa(r.phale) tasa*sampatip\u0101de(o)[15]mah\u0101-ap\u0101ye\u2020\n\n* This form of the genitive sing. in the feminine agrees with t\u0101\u015b mentioned in Hemacandra's Pr\u0101krit Grammar, iii. 63.\n\n\u2020 This is a striking mistake for mah\u0101-ap\u0101dy\u0101;

Now the means (or intermediacy) I esteem to be the most capital in this matter is to give instructions to you. For you are set over many thousands of souls and my people is a mass (or series) of good men. Every subject is my child; as for my own children, I wish that they may be possessed of every benefit and happiness for this world and the next. I also wish, in regard to all, that none may meet suffering, as far as this is possible. Now (suppose) some individual thinks: 'Even he (i.e. the King, however powerful) will not see (what is going on in) the whole country, to be sure,' then you have been appointed to\n\n1 As varga and nik\u00fbya are synonymous terms, and the latter is used by A\u00e7oka in No. 12 of the Rock Inscriptions (Corp. Inscr. p. 84) to denote a body of officials, it will be allowed to use varga in the sense of official; cf. Dict. of B\u00f6hlingsk and Roth. s.v.\n\n2 The sudden change of number is very common in the style of A\u00e7oka.\n\n3 Ekapul\u00eete, \"a solitary person, a forlorn man, a person keeping himself in secrecy,\" is clearly a veiled expression for what commonly is called hina, \"forlorn, forsaken\"; farther, \"a low, bad man, a wretch.\" The synonymous term occurs in aj\u00f1at\u00e2k\u00e2th\u00e2, 46, 17 (cf. Stein's ed.), applied to a knave, a thief, a rogue; \"a night like a tender mother, shrinks those of her children whose prowess assaults the dwellings of mankind, and shrinks from an encounter with the servants of the king.\" A more accurate rendering would seem to be: \"Night, like a mother, covers the knave bold in secrecy (and, the lonely male child) who is determined to do mischief in another's dwelling, and walks in fear of the policemen.\"\n\n4 We have to supply in mind: \"And that man is prompted to do wrong by such a consideration.\"\ntake care that such an individual, for the public weal, do not escape imprisonment or punishment. He shall be kept (P) there lest at unawares he should get loose from captivity, and the community further come to grief. In those matters you should try to steer the right course (i.e. not to swerve from strict justice). Now, man is apt to swerve from his duty by these moral faults: jealousy, passion, harshness, rashness, unheedfulness, sloth, wasting of time. Therefore every one should try not to be possessed of these faults. And the root of all this is freedom from passion, and from rashness in polity and conduct. He who feels himself slack should (the more) strenuously move about, exert himself and go (i.e. be active). And therefore say to yourselves, 'They shall (not?) see impurity of us.' Such then is the command of Dev\u0101nampriya. Obedience to it will be highly fruitful, disobedience highly pernicious. Those who do not conform to it will neither propitiate heaven, nor propitiate the King. For a little abundance of painstaking in this work yields a twofold gain: by obeying you will win heaven, and at the same time acquit yourselves of your duty against me. And this edict shall be read at (festivals of) the asterism Tishya. It shall be read also on any other solemn occasion apart from Tishya. And by doing so you will do your due. For this sake has this edict been written here, that (the magistrates) who are entrusted with the administration of justice in the city should always devote themselves to the task that the town-people may not meet with wanton disregard or wanton vexation.\n\n1 The Jaugada has, with a sudden transition from singular to plural: \"Lest at unawares, those should break loose from captivity and vex the community further.\" Both versions are deficient in syntax, and there is every reason to suppose that the clerks have been meddling with the original draught, which perhaps runs thus: \"tata hetu, akasmite b. na t. amne ca b. d. dukhiyeti, i.e. \"the motive for such measures (viz. imprisoning or applying a chastisement) is to prevent him (the knave) from getting loose from captivity, and the community from meeting further mischief.\"\n\n2 Ajoka means, of course, the beginning of any endeavour to get rid of those faults is to strive against passion and rashness.\n\n3 This glorification of untiring exertion has a decidedly monkish ring in it, and is strikingly like the praise of carana and crama in Aitareya-Brahmana 7, 15. The Jaugada version shows: \"Should move about and rouse his energy and go (in the administration of justice, in polity).\"\n\n4 That paribodha must be taken in the sense of disregard, slighting, appears\nfor this purpose I shall regularly send out every five years a (superior) dignitary, who shall be gentle, kind, free from passion; he will have to ascertain whether one be acting in conformity to the orders of the King. And for this same purpose will the Prince also from Ujjayin send out such an official, and that without letting pass more than three years. Likewise from Taksha\u00e7il\u00e0 will the dignitaries go out on their tour of inspection. When they come to your place, then they will, without neglecting their own business, also ascertain whether one be acting in conformity to the orders of the King.\"\n\nThe contents of the edict show to an evidence that the term mah\u00e1m\u00e1ta is not one of very definite meaning. The mah\u00e1m\u00e1ta, Skr. mah\u00e1m\u00e1tra, is literally a magistratus as well as a person entrusted with great powers, a director; in the general sense of \"director\" it survives in the modern mahaut, an elephant driver. It is therefore quite natural that the municipal mah\u00e1m\u00e1tras, though adorned with the same title as the higher officials sent out by the King for general inspection, are lower in rank than the latter. From No. 3 of the Rock Inscriptions (Cunningham, p. 68) we learn that A\u00e7oka had appointed such high officials for the whole extent of his dominion\u201412 years, i.e. in the 13th year after his inauguration. They are there called r\u0101juka (lajuka) and p\u00e1desika. That these worthies are the same functionaries as those spoken of in the separate edict is clear from the statement added: lajuke ca p\u00e1desike ca pamcausu-\n\nfrom the manner in which the reverse of it, apalibotha, is used in No. 5 of the Rock Inscriptions; from the passage hitanakh\u0101ye dhammayutiy\u0113-apaliboth\u0101y\u0113 viy\u0101pat\u0101; se bandhanabhadhane patividh\u0101n\u012bye apaliboth\u0101y\u0113 mokhiye ca, it results that apalibotha is 'regard, care.' Pari has the same meaning in this word as in the synonymous pari-man, 'to disregard, to slight;' in parikhy\u0101, paricaksh, Greek nepopas.\n\n1 The kh in khakhase is due to the influence of the r in karka\u00e7a. Cf. also Skr. kh\u0101k\u1e63a, kh\u0101ka.\n\n2 Contrary to our custom the writer denotes the place of the person to whom the letter is addressed by \"here.\"\n\n3 A third term would be yuta, Skr. yukta, if the reading of the Girnar version were right. But there can be little doubt that the ca following yuta in that text is a mistake. Yuta simply means 'appointed,' and at another passage, No. 3 at the end, 'an official.'\npamcasu vasesu anusay\u0101nam nikhamatu (or nikhamantu), i.e. \"the lajuka as well as the p\u0101desika shall every five years go out on their tour of inspection.\" Lajuke, r\u0101juka, is to be derived from r\u0101jya 'government,' rather than from r\u0101jan 'a king,' because the short a of lajuka is of too frequent occurrence to allow us ascribing it to a clerical error. Now the short vowel can only be explained on the assumption that lajuka stands for lajjuka. Lajuka then is 'a governor,' whereas p\u0101desika, Skr. pr\u0101de\u015bika, is 'a provincial governor.'\n\nAbout the various functions of the lajukas we find precious data in No. 4 of the Pillar edicts (Cunningham, p. 109). On comparing those data with the information to be gathered from several other inscriptions of A\u1e63oka, especially No. 3 of the Rock Inscriptions already cited, we arrive at the conclusion that the municipal lajukas, al. mah\u0101m\u0101tras, were magistrates entrusted with both judicial and censorial functions; they were, in short, sheriffs. The distinction between the higher or lower mah\u0101m\u0101tras and the dharmamah\u0101m\u0101tras is far from clear. Yet there is a distinction made between them, for in Delhi Pillar edict No. 8, we read: \"Lajuk\u0101 pi bahucee p\u0101nasatasahasesu \u0101y(u)t\u0101, te pi me \u0101napit\u0101 'hevam ca hevam ca paliyovad\u0101tha janam dhammayutam.' Dev\u0101nampiye Piyadasi hevam \u0101h\u0101: etam eva me anuvekham\u0101ne dhammahambh\u0101ni ket\u0101ni; dhammahambh\u0101ni kat\u0101 dhammakate\"; i.e. \"Magistrates (or governors) also have been appointed for many hundreds of thousands of souls, and they have been ordered by me: 'so and so you shall administer justice to the people according to law.' Dev\u0101nampriya Priyadar\u00e7in speaketh thus: For this very sake (i.e. for the cause of righteousness) I have made Law-pillars; I have created dharmamah\u0101m\u0101tras for the sake of Dharma.\"\n\n1 Translated by Burnouf in \"Lotus de la Bonne Loi,\" p. 741, and by the author of this paper in \"Jaartelling des Zuiddelijke Buddhisten.\"\n\n2 This translation of paliyored, to which would answer a Skr. paryav\u0101da, is founded on the parallel passage in No. 4 of the Pillar Inscriptions: dhammayutena ca viyogad\u0101nti janam j\u0101napad\u0101n, \"according to law they will decide (in causes) among the people (i.e. town-people) and country people.\"\nThe creation of the Dharmamah\u0101m\u0101tras preceded by two years the appointment of the other Mah\u0101m\u0101tras; thus we are informed in No. 5 Rock Inscription (Cunningham, p. 72). They were, as we may infer from what is noticed about their functions, especially in the above-quoted Delhi edict, a kind of superintendents for the various denominations of sects, and for poor and destitute persons. Quite in accordance with the philanthropical character of their office, the dharmamah\u0101m\u0101tras have to attend to the management, the careful treatment and the dismissal of prisoners. The limits between their sphere of action in this respect and that of the municipal mah\u0101m\u0101tras or rajjukas, whose cares likewise extended over prisoners,\u00b9 are, for aught I know, nowhere distinctly traced.\n\n\u00b9 Besides the separate edict, cf. Pillar Inscription No. 4.\nART. XVI.\u2014Grammatical Sketch of the Kakhyen Language.\n\nBy the Rev. J. N. Cushing, of the American Baptist Mission, Rangoon, Burma.\n\nThe Kakhyen or Singpho are the most numerous people occupying the mountainous region stretching from Upper Assam across Northern Burma beyond the Chinese boundary into Yunan. In Burma they extend as far south as Momeit and Theinni.\n\nDuring the last forty years, at different times, more or less attention has been called to this interesting people. On the Assam side, Hannay, Robinson, Bronson, Brown and Dalton, and on the Burman side, Anderson, Bowers, and Roman Catholic and Protestant missionaries have published sketches of their language and mode of life.\n\nThe name Kakhyen is an appellation of purely Burman origin. All Kakhyen, whom I have seen, call themselves Chingpaw, which is the same as Singpho. Probably Singpho was written at first Singhpo, the o having the sound of aw, as Bhamo (pronounced Ba-maw) was formerly written Bhamo, and the diacritic point over the o subsequently fell away in use. The ch and the s may be a dialectic difference or the result of somebody's failure to distinguish and represent the exact initial sound of the word. So far as the Kakhyen on the Burman side are concerned, the word Chingpaw does not mean 'a man,' as stated by Robinson, Dalton and Cust. It is their name for themselves, as a people or race. Mashang in one dialect, and masha in others, is the term generally used to signify 'man.' Thus in the Kowrie dialect w\u00f6r\u00e4h mashang hpai yah-moo means give to that man, while w\u00f6r\u00e4h Chingpaw hpai yah-moo means, give to that Kakhyen. As the Kakhyen always refer to themselves by the name of Chingpaw, it is easy to see how a person not understanding their language, and merely\nreflecting a vocabulary through the medium of another language, might think that the term signified 'man.'\n\nThe time of the appearance of the Kakhyen in the mountainous region of the extreme north of Burma is uncertain. Their advent in Assam, and their advance southward and south-eastward in Burma, are comparatively recent. Dalton, evidently depending on Hannay, fixes the date of their appearance in Assam about 1793. A linguistic fact shows that they entered Assam after a long contact with the Burman. The Assamese Kakhyen have in common with those of Burma certain words of Burman origin which must have been the result of considerable intercourse with the Burman. Thus, in Bronson's Singpho Spelling Book we find amat 'a gun,' apet 'sin,' ngrai 'hell,' hprah 'god,' which were manifestly obtained from the Burman.\n\nThe Kakhyen made their first advances among the mountains between Bhamo and China, and began to displace the Shan population, less than two centuries ago. A Chinese Shan prince told me, that less than two hundred years ago there was not a Kakhyen village between Bhamo and Sunda. Now, the mountains are occupied by a large Kakhyen population, who have been described minutely by Anderson. Not a few of the villages and mountains retain their ancient Shan names, although no Shan remain in the region. Many Shan names of objects, especially things connected with agriculture, which the Kakhyen evidently practised in a far less degree in their more northern homes, were domesticated in the language.\n\nThe Kakhyen are still pressing slowly southward and eastward, and displacing the Shan and Burman. In 1868 the writer was prevented from reaching the town of Theinni because the mountains were held by a strong force of Kakhyen at war with the Shan prince. Anxious reference was made to the fact, that they were increasing in number in the district. In such thinly-peopled regions, where the indigenous population is constantly diminishing, the Burman and Shan still cling to the banks of the rivers, while the Kakhyen cease to confine themselves altogether to the\nmountains. Thus it is evident that Tsenbo, at the head of the first defile of the Irrawaddy, was formerly a city of considerable size and strength, from the remains of its fortifications. Now, nearly the whole district is abandoned by the Shan to the Kakhyen, and the city has shrunk to a wretched stockaded village of fifty houses. The migration wave of the Kakhyen has not spent its force, and the spasmodic attempts of the Burman, inspired by their inveterate hatred, to impede its further progress, are unavailing.\n\nThe language of the Kakhyen is by no means so monosyllabic as most of the languages of Farther India. Disyllables are numerous. These are not couplets of two words signifying the same thing which are so common in these languages, but proper disyllabic words.\n\nDoubtless the language has a remote affinity to the Burman. Robinson states that \"about one-fourth of its vocables are allied to the Burmese, and an equal proportion to the dialect of Manipur. Its intonations are similar to those of its cognate, the Burman, and its grammatical construction precisely the same.\" This statement is not borne out by a careful investigation of the language. In grammatical construction the Kakhyen and Burman are precisely the same, and this constitutes their principal resemblance. The writer has compared with the Burman a vocabulary of nearly two thousand Kakhyen words collected at Bhamo, when he reduced the language to writing at that place. Apart from words plainly absorbed directly from the Burman, the following list gives the result obtained:\n\n| English | Kakhyen | Burman |\n|---------|---------|--------|\n| Dog     | kwee    | khway. |\n| Pig     | wa      | wet.   |\n| Go      | wah     | thwah. |\n| Three   | m-hsoom | thong. |\n| Five    | m-nga   | ngah.  |\n| Eye     | mee     | myit (see). |\n| Pat     | taun-tah| htah.  |\n| Fish    | ngi     | ngah.  |\nThese few words are the only ones which show the slightest resemblance to the Burman.\n\nThe Burman has only three tones or intonations, while the Kakhyen has six. In this the Kakhyen resembles the Karen far more than the Burman, for the Karen has six tones. Yet with the assistance of several educated Karen I have been able to find no similarity of the vocables with those of the Karen, except in the word for 'heaven.' For that the Sgau or White Karen word is moo, and the Kakhyen word is p'moo.\n\nThrough commercial intercourse with the Chinese, Burman, and Shan, not a few words have been absorbed from those languages. These, however, have nothing to do with the question of the affinity of the language.\n\nThe tribal divisions of the Kakhyen are numerous, and generally carry with them some difference of dialect. The dialect chiefly followed by the writer in his grammatical notes is the Kowrie. Considering the extent of the region occupied by this people, and the fact, that they have been without books, the dialectic differences are less than might be expected. Many words are identical in all the dialects, while some words are peculiar to a single dialect. A large class of words exists, which have been subject to more or less dialectic change of form, but show clearly their original identity.\n\nA comparison of the Grammatical Notes compiled by Robinson\\(^1\\) from material furnished chiefly by Bronson, the vocabularies and sentences published by Bronson in 1839,\\(^2\\) with the language of the Kakhyen east of Bhamo, shows much less separation than exists between Khamti and Shan.\n\nAllowing for the different systems of Anglicizing the Kakhyen words employed by Robinson, Bronson, and the writer, the following are the most important dialectic variations shown by Robinson's sketch:\n\n1st. Some of the case particles differ. Robinson gives n\u00e1\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Journal Asiatic Society, Bengal, 1849, New Series, vol. xxviii.\n\n\\(^2\\) A Spelling Book and Vocabulary in English, Assamese, Singpho, and Naga, Jalpur, 1839.\u2014Phrases in English and Singpho, Jaipur, 1839.\u2014J.A.S.B. xviii.\nfor the sign of the genitive, whereas the Eastern Kakhyen use *eh*. He also gives *fe* for the dative. This is used by a part of the Eastern Kakhyen, but *hpai* is used by others.\n\n2nd. According to Robinson there is no sign for the plural. *Ni* is common among all the Eastern Kakhyen.\n\n3rd. Robinson gives *aim\u00e1* for the numeral one. *M\u00e1* (also *mee*) is used by the Eastern Kakhyen as an adjective meaning *single*. The common numeral one is *l-ngai*.\n\n4th. Gudaima (Eastern Kakhyen *k-tai*) is used only in an interrogative sense by the Eastern Kakhyen. The relative relation is always indicated by *ai*, of which I find no trace in Robinson or Bronson.\n\n5th. For the demonstrative pronouns *ndai* \u2018this\u2019 and *\u00f3r\u00e1* \u2018that\u2019, the Eastern Kakhyen use *n-tai* and *w\u00f3rah* or *waurah*. *Or\u00e1wah* or *worahwah* is used only of persons, and signifies *that person*. Its opposite is *n-tai-wah* *this person*.\n\n6th. The tense particles of the verb vary somewhat.\n\nFor *h\u00e1*, past tense, the Eastern Kakhyen use *hs\u00e1*.\n\n,, *h\u00e1-dai*, perfect ,, ,, ngoot-hs\u00e1.\n\n,, *\u00e1*, future ,, ,, nah.\n\n,, *\u00fa*, imperative ,, ,, moo (and sometimes oo).\n\n7th. There are dialectic differences in the forms of words:\n\n| Assamese Kakhyen | Burman Kakhyen | English |\n|------------------|----------------|---------|\n| Sri              | soon           | to speak. |\n| Kans\u00fa           | toom-soo       | cow.    |\n| G\u00e1-lau\u00ed         | low-low        | quickly. |\n| D\u00fang            | toong          | to sit.  |\n| Singandi        | shing-gan     | out.    |\n\nSeveral accounts of the mode of life, customs, and manners of the Kakhyen have been published, and it is unnecessary to enter upon a description of them. Dr. Anderson\u2019s \u201cMandalay to Momien\u201d furnishes a faithful sketch of this people. Doubtless much more will be heard of them now, since the American Baptists and the Roman Catholics have established Missions to them at Bhamo.\nGRAMMATICAL SKETCH.\n\nALPHABET.\n\na as in father.\ni \" pique; in closed syllables, as in kick.\ne \" eh.\no \" role.\noo \" loose.\n\u00e9 \" the French peur.\nay \" bay.\nai \" aisle.\nau \" land.\now \" howl.\noi \" coil.\ng guttural.\ngh guttural.\nb as in bat.\nch \" chip.\nch guttural, as in German madchen.\nd as in day.\nf \" fat (only in some dialects).\ng \" get.\nh \" hate.\nj \" jar.\nk unaspirated k.\nkh aspirated k.\nl as in late.\nm \" mate; when forming a syllable by itself it is nasal.\nn \" net.\nng as the final ng in rang.\np unaspirated p.\nhp aspirated p.\nr as in rat.\ns unaspirated s.\nhs aspirated s.\nsh as in shield.\nt unaspirated t.\nht aspirated t.\nv as in vine (only in one dialect).\nw \" wine.\ny \" you.\nWhen any of the consonants form a syllable without any vowel expressed, a slight semi-vowel tone is to be understood.\n\nThe Tones of the Kakhyen Language.\n\nThe Kakhyen is a tonal language. Six tones may be distinguished.\n\nThe first is the natural pitch of the voice with a rising inflection at the end, and may be called the natural tone.\n\nThe second is a bass tone, and may be called the grave tone.\n\nThe third is a slightly higher tone than the second, and is pronounced with an even sound. It may be called the straight-forward tone.\n\nThe fourth is a tone so uttered as to seem abruptly broken off, and may be called the emphatic tone.\n\nThe fifth is a tone uttered with considerable explosive force, and may be called the explosive tone.\n\nThe sixth is the high tone.\n\nIn the matter of tones the Kakhyen is similar to all the languages of Farther India.\n\nClassification of Words.\n\nKakhyen words may be classified as Nouns, Pronouns, Adjectives, Verbs, Adverbs, Prepositions (really Appositions), Conjunctions, and Interjections.\n\nNouns.\n\nNouns are divided into Proper Nouns and Common Nouns. Proper Nouns are the names of persons, countries, towns, etc., as Ma-hang.\n\nCommon Nouns may be divided as follows:\n\n1st. Primitives, as ja, gold; pow, a gong.\n\n2nd. Compound Nouns. These are formed by uniting\n\n(a) Two nouns as shat-ti, rice-pot.\n\n(b) A noun and a verb, as jan-proo, the East (jan, sun,\u2014proo, to rise).\n\n(c) A verb and a noun, as hsin-ai-mashang, a watchman (watch-who-man).\n(d) A noun, verb and noun, as kum-rang-ram-mashang, a groom horse-keeper (horse-keep-man).\n\n3rd. Derivative Nouns. These are formed by affixing certain particles to verbal roots.\n\n(a) nah-lam, which consists of nah, the future verbal particle, and the noun lam, a way or road and signifies what pertains to or what there is occasion for, as hsa-nah-lam-ngah, there is occasion to go (go-will-road-is).\n\n(b) nah-shrah, which consists of nah, the future verbal particle, and the noun shrah (some dialects hsrah) what is for, as khrit-nah-shrah-ngah, there is fear, or there is reason to fear.\n\n4th. Foreign Nouns, introduced from the Shan, Burman and Chinese languages, as li, a boat, lam, a road.\n\nNumber.\n\nNouns may be singular or plural. Often nouns are used in a generic sense and are of common number, as chi nga-loi ngah-a, he has buffaloes, nga-loi, buffalo, being used without any plural sign.\n\nThe plural may be formed in the following ways:\n\n1st. By the use of ni, as kwi-ni, dogs, mashang-ni, men.\n\n2nd. By the use of khai (or some dialects khrai), as mashang-khai, men.\n\n3rd. By affixing the adjective lau, many, as mashang-lau, many men, i.e. men.\n\nGender.\n\nMany Kakhyen words are of common gender, as the names of animals unless distinguished as mentioned below.\n\nMasculine and feminine genders are distinguished,\n\n1st. By different words, as\n\nk-wah, a father. k-noo, a mother.\nmashang } a man. noom-shah, a woman.\nlah-shah } a husband. noom, a wife.\n\n2nd. The masculine of brutes is distinguished by lah and\nsometimes rang, and the feminine by yi, and in one dialect by vi.\n\nkwi-lah, a dog.  \nkwi-yi, a bitch.  \noo-lah } a cock.  \noo-yi } a hen.  \noo-rang }  \noo-vi }\n\nCASE.\n\nKakhyen nouns have no declension by which different cases may be distinguished. Certain particles are used to indicate the relations of case, but there is no change of the noun itself by inflection and the particles are frequently omitted in colloquial use.\n\nThe following paradigm may serve to show the use of these particles:\n\n| CASE | PARTICLES | SINGULAR | PLURAL |\n|------|-----------|----------|--------|\n| Nom. | jam       | mashang, man | mashang-ni men |\n|      |           | mashing-jam ,, | mashang-ni-jam ,, |\n|      |           |           | mashang-khai-jam ,, |\n| Gen. or Pos. | eh | mashang-e of a man | mashang-ni-e of ,, |\n| Dat. | hpai      | mashang-hpai to a man | mashang-ni-hpai to men |\n| Acc. | hpai(deh, with motion towards) | mashang man | mashang-ni-hpai men |\n| Abl. | nai and deh-nai | mashang-nai from a man | mashang-ni-nai from men |\n|      |           | mashang deh nai from a man | mashang-ni-deh-nai from men |\n| Voc. | oo-ay (abruptly pronounced) | mashang-oo-ay man! | mashang-ni-oo-ay, men! |\n\nRemarks on Paradigm.\n\nThe nominative is often used without any distinctive particle, as mashang k-jah-a, man is good. Jam has a definitive power, and is chiefly used in adversative clauses, and is equivalent to as to, in regard to, concerning, n-tai mashang jam k-jah-a, this man is good, i.e. as to this man, he is good.\nThe genitive or possessive case is indicated by the sign eh, as n-tai n-tah-eh ching-kah k-bah-a, this house's door is large. The eh however is not essential, for possession is indicated frequently by placing the noun denoting possession before the thing possessed without the eh, as n-tai lai-kah ngai lai-kah tai-a, this book is my book.\n\nHpai (some dialects fai and fe\u00fb) is used as a dative affix, and is equivalent to to, as ngai hpai, kam-hpraung yah-moo, give money to me. Hpai is frequently omitted, as ngai yah-moo, give (it) me.\n\nThe accusative case is often used without any particle, as n-sin lab-sah-rit, bring water. Hpai is sometimes used, as nang ngai hpai ma-san-toom-i, do you pity me? Hpai seems to denote the object on which the action of the verb bears most strongly, whether the direct or indirect object. The object towards which motion is directed may be indicated by the simple accusative, as chi wau-rah n-tah sah-sa, he has gone to that house; or by affixing deh, as chi wau-rah n-tah deh sah-sa, he has gone to that house.\n\nThe ablative relation is indicated by nai, as too-wah n-tah nai proo-sa, the chief has gone out of the house; or by deh-nai, as chi wau-rah n-tah deh-nai sah-a, he comes from that house. Often no particle is used, as too-wah n-tah proo-sa, the chief has gone out of the house.\n\nThe vocative may be expressed by the simple noun, as ching-khoo, friend! or ching-khoo oo-ay, friend!\n\nChanges in the Forms of Nouns.\n\nSome nouns drop the initial letter when a pronoun is prefixed, as k-wah, father, drops the k, and becomes ngai wah, my father, when ngai is prefixed; k-nam, a daughter-in-law, becomes chi-nam, his daughter-in-law.\n\nPronouns.\n\nPronouns have no inflexional changes of form to indicate gender or case. The relations are expressed in the same manner as those of nouns.\nSKETCH OF THE KAKHYEN LANGUAGE.\n\nPERSONAL PRONOUNS.\n\nFirst Person.\n\nNgai signifies I. N-hteh signifies we, some dialects having n-hteng, i-hteng and i.\n\nSecond Person.\n\nNang signifies thou. Nan-hteh signifies ye, some dialects having nan-hteng, ni and ni-hteng.\n\nThird Person.\n\nChi signifies he, while wau-rah-wah (that person) is also often used with the same signification. Chi-ni signifies they. Other dialects have khan-hteng, shan-hteh, wau-rah-hteh, wau-rah-hteng and wau-rah-ni.\n\nPOSSESSIVE PRONOUNS.\n\nThe possessive pronouns are formed by affixing eh to the personal pronouns, as ngai-eh, my; nang-eh, thy.\n\nREFLEXIVE PRONOUNS.\n\nThe reflexive pronouns are khoom, khoom-mah (some dialects khoom-mi) and tah-nang, as ngai khoom-k-lau nah, I myself will do it; tah-nang n-tah, his own house.\n\nRELATIVE PRONOUN.\n\nThe particle ai represents the relative pronoun, and may be rendered who, which or what, according to the connexion, although strictly speaking ai is a simple verbal particle, as ka-lau-ai-mashang (the working man), the man who works.\n\nINTERROGATIVE PRONOUNS.\n\nk-tai, who? or whom?\nkrah, which\nhpah (some dialects n-hpah nam-hpah m-hpah), what?\n\nADJECTIVES.\n\nAdjectives are of four kinds, simple, verbal, pronominal, and numeral.\n\nSIMPLE ADJECTIVES.\n\nSimple adjectives are those not derived from any other part of speech, as mah (other dialects mi), e.i. kum-rang l-ngai mah ngah, there is a single pony.\nVerbal Adjectives.\n\nVerbal adjectives are those, which, while denoting some quality of a noun, have the verb *to be* inherent in them, as mai, to be good, k-bah, to be large.\n\nThey may be joined directly to the noun, as ma-shang k-jah, a good man, poom k-ji, a little mountain.\n\nComparison of Adjectives.\n\nComparison is not made by any changes in the form of the adjective itself, but by other words.\n\nAn imperfect degree of comparison is expressed by affixing saun saun, rather or about, to an adjective, as maren saun saun, about the same.\n\nThe comparative degree is expressed by the use of the particle htah-krow, as lai-kah n-tai lai-kah wau-rah htah-krow k-jah-a, this book is better than that book. N-tah n-tai n-tah wau-rah htah-krow k-bah-a, this house is greater than that house.\n\nThe superlative degree is expressed by the use of n-lang htah-krow, or by loong-lang, as lai-kah n-tai n-lang htah-krow k-jah-a this book is the best. N-tai li loong-lang htah-krow ning-nan-a, this boat is the newest.\n\nPronominal Adjectives.\n\nPronominal Adjectives may be divided into the following classes:\n\n1st. Demonstrative\u2014\n\nn-tai, this, as oo-n-tai, this fowl; wau-rah (other dialects wo-rah), that, as wau-rah-n-tah, that house.\n\nlay-rah (other dialects leh-rah), this, and hto-rah, that, are used in opposition to each other, as lay-rah n-tah, this (nearer) house, as opposed to hto-rah n-tah, that (remoter) house.\n\n2nd. Distributive\u2014\n\nshit-too, every, as ma-shang shit-too, every man, koo-koo, as mashang koo-koo, every man.\n\nk-tai n-soon whoever\nkrab n-soon whichever\nhpah n-soon whatever\nl-ngai l-ngai each (lit. one, one)\n3rd. Reciprocal\u2014\nl-ngai hteh l-ngai, one another.\n\n4th. Indefinite\u2014\nkhoom-khang (moo) and lah-lai (mah), any; k-kah, as mashang\nk-kah, other or another.\nl-kaanng (two), both.\nkow-mah (some dialects kow-mi), some.\n(rai) shah-mah, something.\nmah-chah, loong-lang, mah-chah n-lang and ning-lang, all.\n\n5th. Correlative\u2014\nning-rai, shing-rai, ning-deh, n-tai-saun-deh, such, of this sort.\nwau-rah-saun-deh (also wo-rah-saun-deh) such, of that sort.\nsaun, such as.\nhpah-pauk, and k-ning, of what sort.\nk-teh, how much? how many?\nn-teh, so much.\n\nNumeral Adjectives.\nCardinals.\nl-ngai, one; l-chaung, two; m-hsoom, three; m-li, four; m-ngah,\nfive; kroo, six; hsa-nit, seven; m-sat, eight; ja-choo, nine; shi,\nten; shi l-ngai, eleven; shi-l-chaung, twelve; khoom, twenty;\nkhoom l-ngai, twenty-one; hsoom-shi, thirty; m-li shi, forty;\nm-ngah shi, fifty; kroo-shi, sixty; hsa-nat shi, seventy; m-sat shi,\neighty; ja-choo shi, ninety; lah-sah, one hundred; lah-sah l-ngai,\none hundred and one; mi-sah, two hundred; m-hsoom sah, three\nhundred; kling-mi, a thousand (Shan).\n\nVerbs.\nKakhyen verbs may be either transitive, as toot, to sell,\nhprah, to destroy, or intransitive, as sab, to go, hten, to be\ndestroyed. Some verbs are used in an active or passive\nsense, according to the demand of the context, without any\nchanges of form.\n\nThe accidents of mood and tense are expressed by the use\nof particles, the form of the verb never undergoing any\nchange.\n\nThe following paradigm indicates the most common form\nof the verb:\u2014\n\nk-lau, to work or to do.\nSKETCH OF THE KAKHYEN LANGUAGE.\n\nPRESENT TENSE.\n\nSINGULAR.

A Kakhyen sentence can generally be transposed into a Burman sentence, word for word, without disturbing the collocation of the words, yet there are scarcely any words which show any affinity for corresponding words in the Burman in form and meaning.\nART. XVII.\u2014Notes on the Libyan Languages, in a Letter addressed to Robert N. Cust, Esq., etc., Hon. Secretary R.A.S., by Prof. F. W. Newman, M.R.A.S.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014You have requested me to write some account of the work which I have in hand concerning the Libyan languages. I cannot satisfy myself without a rather lengthy introduction, which must begin with some account of my sources of knowledge. It may be best to open these historically.\n\nVenture de Paradis, Professor of Turkish in the Paris School of Living Languages, initiated the study of the native language spoken on the highlands and slopes of Mount Atlas. He was well acquainted with Arabic and Persian, and was selected by Napoleon the First as \"Secretary Interpreter\" to the Chief of the Army in Egypt. The celebrated Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Jaubert, his successor in the Turkish Professorship, gives high testimony to his powers and activity. Yet his Dictionary, published by Jaubert half a century later,\u2014that is, in 1844,\u2014is unfortunately grounded on the false assumption that only one language is spoken in the Algerine and in the Morocco highlands. In his own day St. Augustine attested that one language prevailed in Roman Africa, and it was quite natural to suppose the same to be true now, when a large and striking similarity was found in the leading nouns and verbs. But the changes induced in 1500 years have broken up the original unity, and we are now forced to admit at least four languages, each differing from the other more than German from Dutch, or Portuguese from Spanish. Venture incorporated into his Dictionary, which necessarily was only a skeleton, the Algerine language which we call Kabail, and the Morocco language which we call Shilha. His Kabail, moreover, is not identical with\nthe Zouave, and it is often a delicate problem to separate his Shilha words.\n\nSeveral travellers brought to Europe short notices of these tribes, vaguely called Berbers, and very short lists of their native words. But none appear to have put out so much energy as Mr. William B. Hodgson, United States Consul at Tunis, about the time of the French conquest of Algiers (1830) and perhaps a little earlier. Considering his entire isolation and the lack of practical interest to the United States, his energy and literary ambition are remarkable. He induced an \"educated\" Taleb of Ghadames to compose a volume of his travels among the Tuariks (in Arabic perhaps), with an Arabo-Tuarik vocabulary. This MS. he sent to the learned Monsieur D'Avezac, of Paris, a veteran student of African tribes and institutions. But to this day (it seems) it has not been published; possibly because in Paris graver defects were found in it than Mr. Hodgson had the means of detecting. He further, when Pro-Consul at Algiers, engaged Sidi Hamet, a learned native of Bougie, to translate the four Gospels and the Book of Genesis for the London Bible Society into the Kabail language. As a specimen the Society printed only the first twelve chapters of Luke, because of hesitation about the peculiar types employed. On this topic there is something to be explained.\n\nThe Kabail of Bougie, equally with the Zouave, lisps the ordinary \\( t \\) into \\( ts \\). The Galla language also has a peculiar \\( ts \\), for which Karl Tutschek invented a Roman substitute. Either by his own initiation, or by Mr. Hodgson's suggestion, Sidi Hamet invented a new quasi-Arab type, consisting of an Arab \\( \\sigma \\) surmounted by the two dots of a \\( \\dot{\\sigma} \\), to represent the sound which on different areas vacillates from \\( ts \\) to \\( t \\). He likewise invented a new form for the sound which varies from \\( t \\) to Greek \\( \\theta \\), being \\( \\theta \\) in the highlands and \\( t \\) in many of the lower districts. Apparently he objected to Arabic \\( \\dot{\\sigma} \\), because it is radically diverse from \\( \\sigma \\). But the innovations were not well received by the conservatism of the native Talebs, and have not been persisted in; nor did the Bible Society publish the rest of the translation. In\nfact, it was pretty clear that Sidi Hamet, however fair his knowledge of his own language, was far from perfect in his understanding of the Arabic version of the Gospels, from which he translated. The Book of Genesis comes more easily to the mind of a Moslem, and one might perhaps wish that this book had been allowed to take the lead.\n\nI fear to be egotistic; but my entanglement in these studies may seem so eccentric, that perhaps you will allow me to explain how this came about. My friend the late eminent Dr. James Cowles Prichard was writing his third edition of the Physical History of Man in 1834-5, and had just got upon the topic of Mount Atlas and its native races, when the twelve chapters of St. Luke (1833) were handed to him. He knew that I had a small practical acquaintance with Syrian Arabic, and immediately impressed me to study this very moderate volume. Indeed his ardour for science and his immense knowledge gave him much influence with young men: I had spare time, and under his encouragement I worked far more than I ever intended. In short, in 1835, I wrote an outline of the Kabail grammar, and an analysis, separating the native words from the Arabic copiously mixed; and my performance was printed January, 1836, in a magazine called the West of England Journal. The Chevalier (afterwards Baron) B\u00fcnzen took a kind interest in this, and by his own initiation induced the Bible Society to send me their MS. copies of the four Gospels and of Genesis. Over these I wasted much time, not duly taking to heart the certainty that able Frenchmen, with resources far greater, were sure to supersede and reduce to worthlessness anything that I could write. Nevertheless in my leisure hours I continued to work on; and at length, in 1843, finished a somewhat more complete Kabail Grammar; which under the kind patronage of Professor Lassen was published in the Morgenl\u00e4ndische Zeitschrift, 1845.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1844, two valuable works appeared in Paris. The one has been named already, the Dictionary of Venture de Paradis, from which the zealous editor (Jaubert) had constructed a reverse list, Berber-Fran\u00e7ais. He did not\nseparate the Arabic from the Berber. The other was a huge Kabail dictionary, Fran\u00e7ais-Berber, now known by the name of Brosselard. A committee of five persons were responsible for it, of whom Sidi Hamet was one; the other four were Frenchmen. We may probably infer that the chief stress of work fell on M. Brosselard, and that French acumen took sound measures for extracting out of Sidi Hamet whatever was fullest and most exact in his knowledge. This dictionary is, no doubt, a standard work, and thoroughly trustworthy; yet from my point of view it is sadly disappointing. Necessarily it had a political aim\u2014to help French officers in their practical relations with native Libyans; and when these natives superseded Libyan vocables and verbes by Arabic, it was the duty of the dictionary to follow their lead. Thus the result is, that often from twenty lines one can hardly glean a single new Kabail word, and when you turn out a French word in hope, you are disappointed by being put off with Arabic. This work, however, for the first time made clear the distinction in Kabail (and virtually in all the Libyan languages) between the aorist and the present tense. The tendency in Arabic, as in Latin, to narrate past events by the present tense, made it impossible to ascertain from the texts previously laid before us, what forms denoted present time. No doubt Brosselard and his coadjutors hammered out the information from Sidi Hamet.\n\nI may here remark that in the Libyan tongues, three or four conjugations (as in Latin we call them) naturally arise out of the mode in which the present tense is formed. If we set the commonest method as the first, we may say that the first conjugation prefixes \u0398 or T with a vowel, to form the present tense from the aorist; as from Iffer \u2018he hid,\u2019 comes Iffer \u2018he hides\u2019 (Iteffer in the lowlands). The second conjugation doubles the second radical; as from Ifsi (v. neuter) \u2018it melted,\u2019 Ifessi \u2018it melts;\u2019 from Ifred \u2018he swept,\u2019 Ifredd \u2018he sweeps.\u2019 A third and fourth conjugation are marked by vowel change; especially in causative verbs by long \u0101. Thus Isefisi \u2018he caused to melt,\u2019 Isefisi\u0101 \u2018he causes to melt.\u2019 Again, as a fourth conjugation, Isele \u2018he clothed,\u2019\nIsclus 'he clothes.' If the vowel change could be sharply defined, space in a dictionary could be saved by noting the conjugation as 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nAfter a lapse of fourteen years a still more important work appeared\u2014the Kabail, or rather Zouave Grammar of Captain (now General) Hanoteau. He sent it to me with a very polite letter; and I never was able to be sure that my acknowledgments reached him; so much the more shall I be glad if he sees these lines. M. D'Avezac also was, in an earlier year, profuse in his kindness, sending me MSS. in his own handwriting, and inducing certain authorities in Paris to present me with Venture's Dictionary as soon as it came out. But it is too much to hope that he still remains with us, and can learn that I am still thankful. Hanoteau's grammar appears to me most happily planned, as well as vigorously executed. I admire it very much, though I cannot go along with his notation. He makes handsome acknowledgment to M. Bresnier, Professor of Arabic at Algiers, for \"excellent counsels\" and \"inexhaustible\" kindness. Indeed one might rather believe that the work came from a professor, than from a military officer; it is as thorough as it is practical; and, while not professing to be a dictionary, gives, I think, a larger amount of useful native words than the huge dictionary of Brosselard. Indeed Hanoteau must have high talent for language; for this great Kabail work in 1858 was followed in 1860 by a Tuarik grammar, which is, perhaps, more lucid still, and from end to end full of new instruction. Thus, in these two principal languages, the Kabail and the Tuarik, we have at length very firm footing.\n\nMr. James Richardson, a traveller whom one must respect for his devotion to African travel, in 1845 induced Ben Musa, a Taleb of Ghadames, to put pen to paper concerning the Ghadamsi and the Tuarik languages. But instead of writing the Arabic list himself, and requiring the Taleb to translate it, he left everything to the judgment of one who could not possibly understand our wants; a carelessness which has reduced the value of the pages to a minimum.\nHowever, he did set before him the 3rd chapter of Matthew to translate into Ghadamsi; and Ben Musa's productions were lithographed in London (by the Foreign Office, as I understood), perhaps in 1846. I have no other source of information concerning the Ghadamsi language, and it is very limited. With certain oddities\u2014especially the love of the letter \\( f \\) (which Hanoteau seems to pronounce \\( v \\)) and the frequent substitution of Arabic \\( \\xi \\) for the Libyan \\( \\xi \\), Ghadamsi seems a genuine chip of the old block, and by no means an African mongrel.\n\nSpace scarcely allows me to dwell adequately on a short but learned tract of 1857, from the pen of Mr. H. Duveyrier. He writes in German, but since he speaks of \"our Algerian possessions,\" I conjecture that he is of Alsace. He records in a moderate list words of the Beni Menasser, the Beni Mozab, the Zouaves, and the Tuarik of Ghat, all taken down from the lips of natives, and the sounds very carefully reproduced by him in European letters, as alone suitable for the purpose.\n\nUntil recently, I never analysed carefully Mr. Duveyrier's list of words, and now find them to throw light on an obscure question, the relation of the Beni Menasser to the other Libyans. They furnish the largest part of his list.\n\nAfter striking out the pronouns, the numerals, and the words clearly Arabic, I found 137 words left. Of these I recognized 95 as more or less corrupt Kabail, only 8 as modified Tuarik, and 2 as Shilha. The remaining 32 have a few oddities of this dialect, and may have been pure Kabail until expelled from that tongue by Arabic substitutes. On the whole, in spite of the altered pronouns, it seems to be a dialect of Kabail. It is well to note that 25 of the feminine words differ from the Kabail, in having no initial \\( \\Theta \\), but only a final \\( \\theta \\) or \\( t \\); as \\( Ament 'honey;' Agmer-\\(\\theta\\) 'a mare;' Amtot- 'a woman.' In some words the form seems to be masculine\u2014as \\( Abza 'sand,' Imzin 'barley,' for \\( \\Theta abza, \\Theta omzin; \\) also \\( Halez \\) not \\( \\Theta ala 'fountain;' Het not \\( \\Theta et 'an eye.' \\) It is curious that Hodgson gives us as Kabail \\( Amto 'an unworthy woman.' \\) I conjecture that it means a masculine woman, a \"virago.\"\nthe change from \u0398\u03b1\u03bc\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd denoting the loss of the feminine element. [I since find Amto as reproach to a woman in Kabail poetry.]\n\nI did not mention that Mr. W. B. Hodgson, having learned that works on Kabail were about to appear in Paris, brought out rather hastily in 1844 the results of his own researches. I must speak of them with gratitude. I discern his difficulties and his imperfect opportunities. But, for these very reasons, he cannot compete with Hanoteau and Brosselard in solidity. He does not always remember the ambiguity of English words. His analysis of Libyan words is often in fault; nor have we security against vexatious misprints. Thus, when I read in his Tuarik list \u201cInee, month,\u201d the suspicion arises that it is a misprint for \u201cImi, mouth\u201d; but as there is no repetition of words and no context, uncertainty remains. When in some cases the existence of error is obvious, it becomes impossible to receive with absolute confidence anything which is isolated and without corroboration. This is tantalizing, when so much of apparently new matter is presented. Besides, his notation is defective. He does not distinguish \u1e0d from \u1e6d, \u1e0d from k, \u1e0d of Kabail from Arabic \u0636, ts (the lisping t) from t-s. Thus when he writes \u201cEtsuk, suspect,\u201d it remains doubtful whether the root is Suk (Arabic Shuk?) and Et marks present time, or whether Tsuk is a Libyan root.\n\nThese remarks are not intended for censure, but to indicate that information from this source must be accepted as suggestive only, not as final. Mr. Hodgson\u2019s pages range through a great variety of topics, and well deserved to be published. If his lists had been made alphabetical, they would have been much more serviceable. He has vocabularies of the Kabail, the Tuarik, the Mozabi, the Ergeia (or Wadreag) and the Sergoo,\u2014all of our Libyan family; but he imperfectly explains what dialect of Tuarik is intended. The Sergoo is that of Barth\u2019s Awelimmiden, who are the Tuariks of the south-west. The Kabail list is longer than all the rest together.\n\nDr. Barth affords a copious source of information, still\nmore difficult to use aright or to rest upon with uniform confidence. The work that he did was immense, and he was distracted from his Tuarik by other languages. I think his ear cannot have been good, and those to whom he listened must have jabbered in very rude and ungrammatical style.\n\nIn 1856-7, while preparing his five large volumes for the press, he was glad to get help from me in putting his Tuarik leaves into shape. The MS., written in minute hand for portability, was often very difficult for him to decipher; and the idea has come over me, that this may have involved error. While I had no check upon him, I trusted his material, as needing only wise analysis: but since Hanoteau has thrown out such a flood of light, I use Barth with greater timidity, and find numbers of his phrases less and less amenable to the laws of the language, precisely because I know those laws somewhat better. Nevertheless, when he gives us, not sentences, but names of things which he knew familiarly, his possible error lies within narrow limits. His vocabulary of concrete things is very copious, exceeding that of Hanoteau. It is impossible not to give weight here to his testimony, only with some allowance for occasional confusion of sounds. The chief doubt that remains is, whether his \"Awelimimden\" have not largely imbibed words from the Fulahs, from Timbuctu (Songhay), or perhaps from Hausa: and in a few cases this is easy to trace. Yet, on the whole, I incline to believe his ample vocabulary to be native Surku; certainly it is to be received as such until disproved.\n\nBesides the Tuarik of Barth, which is that of the southwest, and that of Hanoteau, which has the oasis of Tuat for its centre, a third dialect, that of Ghat, of the Azgar tribe, already touched on by Duveyrier, was taken up independently by Mr. H. Stanhope Freeman, British Vice-Consul at Ghadames. His little book is full of new material. It appeared in 1862. The diversity of these three dialects is striking; though, it may be, a foreigner will say that three English counties may be picked out, in which the peasant-dialect varies as much. But it certainly took me by surprize to find Barth and Hanoteau differing in words that must\nperpetually occur, and thereby constantly perplex. For all, every, Barth has Rurret and Er\u00e9tuse; for few he has Wafaror\u2014words not to be found in Hanoteau; but, in turn, Hanoteau and Freeman use Imda (it is finished), Emden (they are finished) as a clumsy substitute for All. Iket in Ghadamsi means a little, but both Hanoteau and Barth use it to mean All! It is chiefly by diversity in such words, and in the pronouns (so called)\u2014that is, not demonstrative only, but indefinite and relative,\u2014that these idioms are put into contrast, and made virtually separate languages. Still, besides this, the names of very elementary things differ more than would be expected. Such also is the change from ancient to modern Greek.\n\nI have not mentioned Mr. Delsporte, once French Consul at Mogadore, and one of the Committee responsible for Brosse-lard's large Kabail dictionary. He was the first, I believe, to impart definite notions concerning the Shilha tongue, called the Morocco Berber. His papers were lithographed in Paris, and he politely sent them to me. Soon after, the Royal Asiatic Society received from Mr. Hodgson, already named, the Shilha MS. of Sidi Ibrahim's travels among these Morocco tribes, with a free Arabic version. The Society engaged me in 1846-7 to edit the Shilha MS., which gives the best specimen of this language that I have yet seen. The poetical tale of Sabi, which Mr. Delaporte brought to Paris, is quite swamped in Arabic, which almost hides and suppresses the native Shilha.\n\nAs to the Zenaga, or Libyan in the Senegambian quarter, which General Faidherbe has so recently unveiled, while we cannot deny the Libyan elements, the diversity in nine words out of ten is too great to comment on. The change of sound, even when we seem to detect a Libyan word (as in Amedukatz, for Amdukkel 'a comrade,' Shebbosh for Asaggas 'a year'), is often so grave, that long practice and large materials are wanted, to judge what is possible from what. I feel quite unable at present to connect this new dialect profitably with the others.\n\nWe can now, at least for convenience, distribute the Libyan\nlanguages as follows. First, we have the group which seems to be Numidian eastward; Massylian, I suppose, on the lowlands and sea coast. We call this all Kabail. Its extreme type is that of the Zouave mountaineers. This is softened at Bougie, a maritime town; and in some of its dialects is rather dissolved than softened, so great is the corruption of sounds. To these may probably be added the Beni Manasser. Except as preserving a few words otherwise rare, and some peculiar use of the pronouns, these dialects seem not to deserve literary notice. Next is a small group very anomalous. It consists of the Beni Mozab, a white race, and the inhabitants of the oases of Wadreag and Wergela, black races with woolly hair. Hanoteau gives the name Tagaubant to the dialect which Hodgson names Mozabi. Eregiyya is Hodgson's name for the speech of Wad-reag, which, he says, is identical with that of Wergela. His lists would lead me to say, that after all, these idioms are not a different language from Kabail. They have adopted or retained some Tuarik words, and have some notable words of their own, apparently pure Libyan. But nothing appears to suggest that a man of Bougie would not get on with them as easily as a Londoner with a Lancashire peasant.\n\nMy present tendency is to comprise them all in the Kabail, with which they agree in some elementary and characteristic words. If so, my second language is the Shilha, which seems to deserve fuller knowledge: but this will hardly be obtained from Talebs who overlay everything with Arabic, the moment they touch religion or morals. The town of Tarudant seems to be a centre for this language, which they emphatically call Tamazight. Moroccoo-Berber is the title which may be quickest understood by our public. Perhaps it is the specific dialect of ancient Mauritania Tingitana. A third and far more important language is that of the Tuarik, which Hodgson says is called by themselves Tergeea. Duveyrier names it Targish. Hanoteau and Barth agree that Tuarik is not a native name. Barth insists that the best Arab authorities spell it \u062a\u0648\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0643 with soft t and soft k, so that it means fugitives, deserters; that is,\npeople, who, to escape subjection to Arab dominion, quitted their homes. Be this as it may, the name has prevailed and does prevail. That the natives do not use it, is no reason why we should abandon it, any more than that we should leave off calling the Germans Germans. Plutarch thought Germans to be a Latin word, and to mean \"genuine fellows\"! Now, as it would awkwardly confuse Germans and Dutch, if we were to call the Germans Deutsch; so, to call the Tuarik Imoshagh and each man an Amashigh, confounds them with the Shilhas, of whom each calls himself Amazigh (or freeman, Frank) and books in his language Amsigh. To change names that have been long in use surely promotes confusion.\n\nThe late Dr. Butler, very learned in geography, set down Getulians in his map, on the northern side of the Great Desert, and Melano-Getulians on the south; which implies that the Romans believed the Getulians not only to have conquered the Moorish coast northward, as Pliny tells, but to have been rovers over the great desert. Provisionally I accept them as probable ancestors of the Tuarik. That they fall into three dialects I have already said. I cannot find what town or oasis Barth regards as the centre of his Awelimmid\u00e9n. Hanoteau's grammar teaches us the language of the Isaqqam\u00e1ren, vassals of the Ihaggaren, whose centre is Tuat, N.W. corner of the Tuarik area; Freeman professes to teach the dialect of Ghat, on the N.E. corner. This is the region of the Azgar tribe. The fourth language which remains is that of Ghadames, which some say is mixed with Tibbu, the ancient Garamantian.\n\nNo dictionary as yet exists, which registers these Libyan words alphabetically, and explains them in a European tongue; and if such a work were compiled for military and diplomatic service, it would be so buried in Arabic, as to be quite inconvenient for students curious of native tongues. On the whole, it has appeared to me that without wholly sacrificing the thing needed by actual travellers, merchants and officers, good service would be done by a dictionary of Libyan purged of all imported Arabic. Sometimes, no doubt, this involves a delicate problem. When a Libyan\nword has a sensible likeness to Hebrew as well as to Arabic, it may be most true and primitive Libyan, and on no account to be ejected. Thus *Eshin* 'a tooth,' pl. *Ishinan* (Tuarik), is not only like to the Arabic *Sinn*, pl. *Sinn\u00e1n*, but more like still to the Hebrew *Sh\u00e9n* 'a tooth.' But here the Ghadamsi *As\u00edn*, pl. *Sinn\u00e1n*, comes closer to Arabic. In certain words a harsh initial consonant is dropped, which is found in the Hebrew correlative equally as in the Arabic: then I do not at once infer that it is an importation. The word *Ajenna*, for Heaven, has caused me much doubt. It is perhaps from Arabic *El jenna* 'the garden (of Paradise).' In Barth it is *Ashinna*; and in Hausa we find from Sch\u00f6n that Heaven is expressed either by *Alitshana* (apparently *El jenna*) or by *Lahira*, which is evidently *El akhira* 'the other (world).' Indeed, Hell in Sch\u00f6n is *Wuta lahira* 'fire (of) the other (world).' While thus inclined to trace the Arabic *Jenna* through the Tuarik to the Hausa, Barth draws me the other way by giving *Ajenni* and *Akonay* as alike meaning 'rain.' In every case of doubt I retain a word.\n\nI keep the Kabail, the Tuarik, the Shilha, and the Ghadamsi lists, quite separate, even when the same word is slightly modified or not at all. Thus *Giel\u00f3* 'a bride,' appears as Kabail, and *Tislit* 'a bride,' as Shilha. (Barth gives *Tamaselait*, but I cannot find Hanoteau's version of the word.) Moreover, I find it convenient to make three separate lists in each language; first, of verbs and their verbals, in which the adjectives are included by reason of Libyan structure: next, of nouns that are not manifestly verbals. Some or many of the latter may turn out to be foreign,\u2014whether Tibbu, Songhay, Hausa, or Fulah. To strike them out or mark them when detected, is easy. Thirdly, I shall try to register the pronouns, particles, and primitive adverbs. This third list may have much in common with languages of North Africa which are less allied to the Syro-Arabian. The difficulty of making it turns upon the extreme vagueness of the Libyan conjunctions and indeed prepositions. I have at present no confidence that I shall execute this part satisfactorily. I have already\nfinished the first and second. I believe you asked me to send you some specimens. I take some at random:\n\n| From Kabail Nouns not Verbal | From Shilha Nouns not Verbal | From Tuarik Nouns not Verbal |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| **N**                       |                               |                              |\n| Anu, deep well.             | Akai, head, *pl.* Ikuyan.     | Ul, heart (Ulhi, B.) *pl.*   |\n| Yiwan, one, *f.* Yiwa\u1e63.     | Tekwit, a cough.              | Ulawen.                      |\n| Tin\u012b, dates, V.

Either *x* or *c* suits well enough for \u0634; but I prefer to retain *c* for Italian *c* in *cio*, or for the sound which vacillates from this to *k*; then *x* serves for \u0634.\n\nSince the modern Greek sounds of \u0394 \u0398 \u0393 are exactly those for \u062f \u062a \u063a, surely the obvious irrefutable method is, to adopt the Greek letters. Only, to prevent confusion of the small \u0393 (\u03b3) with *y*, I have in my Arabic dictionary struck off the cross from *f*, and further (to be less like a long \u0393) have depressed the letter in the line (r).\n\nI will next give some specimens of verbs and verbals:\u2014\n| Kabail | Shilha | Tuarik |\n|--------|--------|--------|\n| Elli, Zouave for Eldi; which see. n.a.

But hitherto, I am sorry to say, after elaborately clearing off very corrupt Arabic, my hope of learning a new Libyan word is sure to be foiled by the vagueness of the French translation; which may enable me to guess at the meaning, but does not really fix it. Hanoteau's Kabail Poetry involves like difficulty.\n\nIt is to my mind much to be rejoiced in, that Hanoteau and Faidherbe, Barth, Duveyrier, and Hodgson, are all of one mind as to the unfitness of Arab types to convey the Libyan sounds accurately. Our vowels cannot be superseded by Arab marks; Arab consonants do not suit the Libyan tongue. Still, I am sorry to say, I cannot digest Hanoteau's invention of writing not Gh but r' for \u1e21, which involves a general change in the received spelling of proper names. This objection is in itself insuperable. But Hanoteau seems not to understand why Europe has used gh; viz. because the sound of \u1e21 is to that of \u1e21 precisely as that of g to k, that of b to p, that of z to s; and because kh, ch are current for \u1e21, therefore gh is used for \u1e21. So in Dutch and old English. Hanoteau simply assures us, that \u1e21 is not g (who said it was?); of course we may reply that neither is \u1e21 k. But he tells us, it really is r! This means only that it is vibratory. True; \u1e21 and \u1e21 are all vibratory. Again, he writes t' for b and dh for \u1e21; th for \u1e21 and \u1e21 for \u1e21, out of harmony. The two last should be dealt with by the same law, making them either th and dh, or t' and \u1e21', or better than either way, \u0398 and \u03b4, \u0398 and \u0394. On the other hand, b and \u1e21 being a pair of the same kind in Arabic, should be paired by us, if represented as t and d modified. But, as said, I object to compounding two English letters for one sound. Here, moreover, the Libyans have but one letter, though its pronunciation varies locally. Thus Night is sounded Idh by the Zouaves, and Ith at Bougie, if we may judge by Sidi Hamet and Brosselard. The verb cut is sounded differently in London and in Manchester, but we should gain nothing by writing it in\ntwo ways on that account. Still, if we do, let the types follow analogy. I will not here trouble you further with detail.\n\nIf I can compile these lists with moderate success, it will be a mere mechanical problem (which any one can execute, should it be worth while) to form a reverse list of Nouns in English alphabetical order. Such a list of the Verbs requires far more judgment and care. When I try to prepare the English list, I cannot yet at all please myself. Our language, mixed of Saxon, Norman, and Latin, is too copious, and the senses of the Latin part too sharply defined. At any rate I defer this. My ambition at present is, so far as possible, simply to reproduce the ancient Libyan in a concise form, very accessible to all our students. The separation into four or more languages will not mar the result; and to mix them into one, if ever it were wished, is very easy work.\n\nMany phenomena of the Libyan tongues have surprized and pleased me, as superior to Arabic and Hebrew in their primitive formation. In Arabic I have always felt two scandals; the crippled condition of the relative pronoun, and the dire want of a particle for of. As to the latter, it would seem that the Northern Libyans have viciously imitated the clumsiness of modern Arabic, and have neglected (but have not lost) the particle En, Ne (of) which they have in common with H\u016busa and Songhay. The Tuarik have no other mode of expressing our of. And here is a curious remark, as to the intense contrariety of Tuarik to Songhay construction. Barth gives us as the Songhay of Aghadez\u2014\n\nGengen hamu, wild animals.\nGengi n haia, king of the desert.\nGengi n hani, wild buffalo.\nGengi n yoes, giraffe.\n\nEvidently we see that in these Gengi means the wilderness; and, indeed, in the same page we come upon Gengi, desert. Thus Haia means king, and Hamu, animals; Hani, bull; Yoes perhaps camel; true, in the preceding page so it stands. Thus, n meaning of, where the Tuarik, like the English,\nwould say: king of wilderness, bull of wilderness, camel of wilderness, etc., the Songhay precisely reverses the order, saying: wilderness of camel, in precisely the same sense. I explain this to myself thus. The *n*, which means *of*, is comparable to Latin and Greek genitive termination -is, -os. This in Songhay, as in Greek, follows the noun which it affects; in English and in Libyan precedes it. Thus Gengi n yoes has the structure of Solitudin-is camelus, or if we accept the genitive as a possessive adjective, \u0391\u03b3\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03b7\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, wild camel, giraffe. In short, the *n* which is a preposition to the Tuarik is a postposition to the Songhay; a fact which at once suggests a general diversity of syntax. I think this diversity must cause repulsion between the languages.\n\nNext, as to the relatives, the Libyan has as many as can be wished, unrestricted by Arab rules, and capable, as in Latin or Greek, of accepting a preposition, which here becomes a postposition; as *Ma* 'which;' *Mas* 'by which;' *Maf* 'on which,' etc. Not only is the completeness of the relative system a power to construction, but the existence of three participles in the verb, past, present, and future, as in Greek, is a great advantage over Hebrew and Arabic. Moreover the relative or definite article (whichever in this connexion it is to be called) by junction with the participle makes a compact result as in Greek or German. The formulas \u1f41 \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c8\u03b1\u03c2, \u1f41 \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c8\u03c9\u03bd, \u1f41 \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c8\u03c9\u03bd, can be literally reproduced in Libyan. Nay, if I mistake not, it has a double imperative, like \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5 (write, habitually or continuously), \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c8\u03c9\u03bd, write, i.e. finish the writing. In spite of the present barbarous vagueness of the particles which define and subserve reasoning, it seems clear to me that under native cultivation the language would be as superior to Arabic in flexible syntax as it is in melody.\n\nAnother point of interest to me is the causative form of the verb, induced by prefixing *s*, as *Ers* 'come down'; *Sers* 'cause to come down,' 'bring down.' In Amharic *s* has the same force; as *Kabara* 'he was honourable,' *Askabara* 'he made honourable,' or 'caused to honour' (Isenberg). I have read in some Arabic grammar that by reason of the tenth\nform beginning with Ist, the Arabic language is supposed to have lost a causative form beginning with Is. It is curious to find this in the Libyan and in the Amharic.\n\nWhen or how I shall be able to publish remains to me in much obscurity. If I were rich enough to risk entire loss, it is very unsatisfactory to have a book remain in a printer's warehouse. I suppose some effort must be made to get subscribers, as a security for moderate diffusion, as well as because the sight of a book is its best advertisement. The day is gone past at which one might hope for foreign support by taking Latin as the basis of comparison. To the English nation and the United States I suppose one must look. But at present I have to work on, in a sort of blind faith.\n\nI am, very truly yours,\n\nF. W. Newman.\nART. XVIII.\u2014The Early History of Tibet. From Chinese Sources. By S. W. BUSHELL, M.D., Physician to H.B.M. Legation, Peking.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nTIBET, according to the Chinese, was inhabited by many scattered tribes up to the end of the sixth century, when they first heard of the establishment of a kingdom in their midst by Luntsansolungtsan, who, according to the 'Researches' of Ma Tuanlin, during the period K'aihuang, (A.D. 581\u2013600) of the Sui Dynasty, extended his dominion on the south-west as far as P'olom\u00ean (Br\u0101hma\u1e47a\u2014Central India), till at the beginning of the T'ang Dynasty their army numbered 100,000 warriors, and they became a powerful state. He is probably the Luntsansu of the genealogy on p. 443. It was his son Ch'itsunglungtsan who sent the first mission to the Emperor T'aitsung of the T'ang Dynasty in 634, and was given a Chinese princess in marriage in 641.\n\nThe kingdom is described in the History of the T'ang under the name T'ufan. The second character fan, as first shown by Remusat, ought properly to be read po, being written with a phonetic which has the two sounds fan and po. This is confirmed by the inscription of the year 822 given in the Appendix, in which the native Tibetan name Bod is rendered in Chinese by the same character Fan. T'ufan is therefore equivalent to T'ubod. In the Sung History T'ufan is still used, but in the History of the Liao,\na Tatar dynasty reigning at the same time over the north of China, it is recorded that the Emperor Taotsung (1055\u20131100) gave a princess to be married to the son of the sovereign of T'upot'e. During the Mongolian Yuan Dynasty both Chinese forms T'ufan and T'upot'e were used, the last being equivalent to T'ubod, which is still the Mongol name of Tibet. During the Ming Dynasty the country was generally called Wussitsang, a name which occurs also in the preceding Yuan History, and which is compounded of the native names of the two principal provinces, Dbus and Gtsang; the modern name Weitsang is the same, the final s being mute in the Lhasa pronunciation of the present day. The names of Hsi (Western) Tsang and Hsi Fan are also used in Chinese books, and the natives are called T'opot'e and Tangkut'e. The European name of Tibet is derived from Mohammedan sources, and occurs in the Eastern Travels of the Arab merchant Soleyman, published according to M. Reinaud in 851. Marco Polo uses the form Tebet, and devotes two chapters to its description.\n\nThe accompanying paper is a literal translation from the official histories of the T'ang dynasty, which was founded in 618, and the notes are mainly derived from the same. There are two histories of this dynasty, distinguished as old and new, which constitute Nos. 16, 17, of the series of twenty-four dynastic histories. These histories are compiled from the records of events written at the time of their occurrence by the officials of the State Historiographer's office, an important department of the Hanlin College of Literature, the duties of which are the custody and preparation of the historical archives, and the composition of official biographies of all eminent public servants, as well as a relation of the foreign states which send tributary missions. These archives are collected after the fall of the dynasty, and given to a commission appointed by the emperor of the new dynasty to be arranged after a uniform model. They are generally divided into three sections: (1) 'Imperial Records,' containing a succinct chronicle of the several emperors; (2) a series of 'Memoirs' on chronology, rites, music, juris-\nprudence, political economy, state sacrifices, astronomy, elemental influences, geography, government offices, vehicles and costume, literature and bibliography; (3) 'Narratives' of the lives of persons of eminence, and of what is known about foreign nations of the period. Should the dynasty last long, the archives are often compiled into book form by officials during its reign.\n\nThe Old T'ang History was first compiled by Wei Ching in 110 books, extending from the beginning of the dynasty to the period K'aiyuan (713-741). Wei Shu copied this with additions, cutting out the biographies of corrupt ministers. The life of the emperor Sutsung (756-762) was written by one of the historiographers, and the various sections written up to date by others till it comprised 130 books. As we have it now it was compiled by a commission, headed by Liu Chu, appointed by the founder of the After Chin dynasty, and completed in 200 books about the middle of the tenth century. After the period Ch'angch'ing (821-824), when the dynasty began to decline, the historiographers neglected their duties, and the history had to be completed from miscellaneous sources. During the Sung dynasty it was thought desirable to have a more perfect history, and a new commission was appointed to remodel the work about the middle of the eleventh century, the result of which was the New T'ang History in 255 books, written chiefly by Ouyang Hsiu and Sung Ch'i.\n\nThese two voluminous compilations circulated together, each having its school of admirers, until the middle of the last century, when the Emperor Ch'ienlung happily had the two combined, the one being appended to the other as a running commentary in small type, and note being made of any discrepancy. This edition is in 260 books, of which the 256th and 257th are devoted to Tibet. The text of this is from the Old History, and is in large type, while the paragraphs from the New History are in smaller type, and the two sources are similarly distinguished in the translation.\n\nThis lengthened introduction is intended to show the authenticity of the narrative, most of the events having been\nrecorded at the time, so that the relation as far as it goes is contemporary. The names of the sovereigns have a general resemblance to those given in the books on Tibetan history: the fifth on the list, for example, Ch'ilisulunglieltsan, who died in 755, being about as near as Chinese cumbrous nomenclature would allow to Khri srang lde btsan, who, according to Csoma de Kor\u00f6se' list, was born in 728, ch'i having been formerly k'i, and l being used for r, a letter absent from the Chinese syllabary. There are so many discrepancies, however, in the tables given by different authors, that it is difficult to find a correct standard for comparison; for instance, in Georgii Alphabetum Tibetanum, Schmidt's translation of Ssanang Setzen, Csoma de Kor\u00f6se' Tibetan Grammar and Emil Schlagintweit's K\u00f6nige von Tibet, the genealogical lists differ very widely both from each other and from the dates of the T'ang Histories. These tables are all derived from Buddhist sources, where chronology appears always to be deemed of minor importance. A table of some of the principal dates given in the paper may perhaps be useful for future comparison.\n\n| Event                                                                 | Year |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------|\n| Ch'itsunlungtsan sent the first mission to China                     | 634  |\n| Married to the Chinese Princess Wench'eng                             | 641  |\n| Invaded Central India                                                | 648  |\n| Ch'ilipapu, grandson of Ch'itsunlungtsan, succeeded                  | 650  |\n| Ch'inushsilung, son of Ch'ilipapu, succeeded, aged 8                 | 679  |\n| Princess Wench'eng died                                               | 680  |\n| The regent Ch'inling was attacked and killed himself                 | 699  |\n| Ch'lisoltsan, son of Ch'inushsilung, who was killed on an expedition against Nep\u00e1l and India, succeeded, aged 7 | 705  |\n| Married to the Chinese Princess of Chinch'eng                       | 710  |\n| Treaty concluded with China recorded on stones, which were afterwards erected on the frontier at Ch'ihling | 730  |\n| Princess of Chinch'eng died                                          | 741  |\n| Ch'ilisulunglieltsan died                                             | 755  |\nTHE EARLY HISTORY OF TIBET.\n\nSoheilungliehtsean, son of Ch'ilisulungliehtsean, succeeded... 755\nAfter conquest of N.

Books 256, 257.\n\nT'ufan is situated eight thousand li west of Ch'angan(1). It was formerly, during the Han dynasty, the territory of the Western Chi'iang. The original source from which the natives sprang is unknown.\n\nFormerly the Western Chi'iang(2) comprised a hundred and fifty tribes, scattered over the lands of Ho, Huang, Chiang, and Min. Included among them were the Fa Chi'iang, and T'angmao, who, however, had then no intercourse with China. They were settled on the west of the Haichih river. Their ancestor (founder of the dynasty), named Hut'ip'usuyeh, was a powerful warrior, and most politic, and by degrees united the different Chi'iang tribes, and ruled over their territory. Fan resembles fa in sound, hence his descendants acquired the name of T'ufan, their surname being P'usuyeh.\n\nSome say that they are descended from T'ufa Liluku of the Southern Liang Dynasty(3). Liluku had a son named\nFanni. When Liluku died, Fanni was still a boy, and his younger brother Jut\u2019an succeeded to the throne. He appointed Fanni governor of Anhsii. During the After Wei dynasty, in the first year of the period Sh\u00eanjui (A.D. 414), Jut\u2019an was overthrown by Chi\u2019fuch\u2019ihp\u2019an, of the Western Ch\u2019in dynasty, and Fanni collected the remnant of the people, and submitted to Tsuch\u2019i M\u00eangsun, by whom he was appointed Governor of Linsung (Kanchou). When M\u00eangsun in turn was slain, Fanni at the head of his people fled westwards across the Yellow River, and beyond Chishih founded a state in the midst of the Ch\u2019iang, with territory extending over a thousand li. Fanni was celebrated for his power and wisdom, and all the Ch\u2019iang tribes placed themselves under his rule, and, being governed mildly and justly, ran to his standard as it were to market. Then he changed his surname to Sup\u2019uyeh, and adopted T\u2019ufa as the name of his state, which became afterwards corrupted into T\u2019ufan. His descendants increased in number and power, and continued to acquire land and fame till their territory became of vast extent. During the Chou and Sui dynasties (557\u2013618), the Ch\u2019iang tribes still blocked the way, and they did not communicate with China.\n\nThe natives style their sovereign tsamp\u2019u; the ministers of state, called great lun and small lun, are appointed to control state affairs.\n\nThey call a famous hero tsan, and man p\u2019u, hence the title of the sovereign, tsamp\u2019u(4). The consort of the tsamp\u2019u is styled momeng. The officials include one chief minister, called lunch\u2019ai, with one assistant, called lunch\u2019aihumong, who are also styled great lun and small lun; and one commander-in-chief, called Hsipiench\u2019ep\u2019u. Also a chief minister of the interior, called Nanglunch\u2019ep\u2019u, also called Lunmangj\u00e9, an assistant minister, Nanglumlingp\u2019u, and a lesser minister, Nanglunch\u2019ung. Also a chief consulting minister, called Yuhapoch\u2019ep\u2019u, an assistant, Yuhamlingp\u2019u, and a lesser minister, Yuhapoch\u2019ung. These have the control of state affairs, and are styled collectively Shanglunch\u2019ep\u2019ut\u2019uch\u00fc.\n\nThey have no written characters. Notched pieces of wood and knotted strings are used in covenants. Although there are officers, they are not constantly employed, being only appointed when there is stress of business. For collecting warriors they use gold arrows.\n\nThey use a gold arrow seven inches long as a sign of office. There is a post\nstation every hundred li. If the war be important the courier carries also on his breast a silver hawk, if of urgent importance several of these hawks.\n\nWhen the country is invaded the smoke-fires are lighted, there being a tower every hundred li.\n\nTheir punishments are most severe, and even for small crimes the eyes are scooped out, and the nose cut off, or stripes inflicted with a leather whip. They differ according to caprice, there being no fixed code. They imprison men in holes several tens of feet under the ground, and release them only after two or three years.\n\nWhen they entertain envoys from foreign countries, they always bring out a yak for the guest himself to shoot, the flesh of which is afterwards served at the banquet.\n\nThe officers are assembled once every year for the lesser oath of fealty. They sacrifice sheep, dogs, and monkeys, first breaking their legs and then killing them, afterwards exposing the intestines and cutting them into pieces. The sorcerers having been summoned, they call on the gods of heaven and earth, of the mountains and rivers, of the sun, moon, stars, and planets, saying: \"Should your hearts become changed, and your thoughts disloyal, the gods will see clearly and make you like these sheep and dogs.\" Every three years there is a grand ceremony, during which all are assembled in the middle of the night on a raised altar, on which are spread savoury meats. The victims sacrificed are men, horses, oxen, and asses, and prayers are offered in this form: \"Do you all with one heart and united strength cherish our native country. The god of heaven, and the spirit of the earth, will both know your thoughts, and if you break this oath they will cause your bodies to be cut into pieces like unto these victims.\"\n\nThe climate of the country is extremely cold.\n\nWith frequent thunder, lightning, wind, and hail. The snow remains, the height of summer being like the springtime of China, and there is always ice in the mountain valleys. There is a cold malaria in the soil which causes the natives to have enlarged spleens, but is not dangerous to life.\n\nThey grow no rice, but have black oats, red pulse, barley, and buckwheat. The principal domestic animals are the yak, pig, dog, sheep, and horse. There are flying squirrels, re-\nsembling in shape those of our own country, but as large as cats, the fur of which is used for clothes. They have abundance of gold, silver, copper, and tin.\n\nThe natives generally follow their flocks to pasture, and have no fixed dwelling-place.\n\nMany live to a great age, a hundred years and upwards. They are commonly clothed in felt and leather. They are fond of painting their faces red. The women gather their hair in a single plait, and coil it round the head. The officers in full costume wear as ornaments\u2014those of the highest rank se-se(5), the next gold, then gilded silver, then silver, and the lowest copper\u2014which hang in large and small strings from the shoulder, and distinguish the rank of the wearer.\n\nThey have, however, some walled cities. The capital of the state is called the city of Lohsieh(6).\n\nThe tsamp'u resides in the Papu valley or in the Leso valley.\n\nThe houses are all flat-roofed, and often reach to the height of several tens of feet. The men of rank live in large felt tents, which are called julu. The rooms in which they live and sleep are filthily dirty, and they never comb their hair nor wash. They join their hands to hold wine, and make plates of felt, and knead dough into cups, which they fill with broth and cream and eat the whole together.\n\nThey worship the yuanlii(7) god, and believe in witches and seers.\n\nThey are fond of the doctrine of Buddha, and no important state affairs are settled without consulting the Buddhist monks.\n\nThey have no knowledge of the seasons, and barley harvest is reckoned the beginning of the year. Their games are chess and bowls, trumpet-blowing and beating drums. The bow and sword are never separated from the body. They honour the strong and neglect the old, so that mothers bow down to their sons, and sons rule over their fathers, and whether going out or coming in the young men are always in front, the old men placed behind. The general's orders are sternly enforced, and in battle when the front rank is annihilated, the rear rank still presses on.\n\nThe armies carry no provision of grain, and live on plunder. The armour and helmet are very strong and cover the whole body, with holes for the eyes only, so that the strongest bow and sharpest sword can hardly do them much harm.\n\nThey consider death in war as more honourable than death from disease, and if several generations have been killed in\nbattle the family is ennobled. If any one turns his back on the foe, they hang a fox's tail on his head, to show that he is as cowardly as a fox, and exhibit him in crowded places as a warning to others. They are extremely ashamed of this, and deem death preferable. When they do homage, the two hands must touch the ground, they bark like dogs, and after rising again prostrate themselves.\n\nWhen mourning for father or mother, they cut off their hair, paint their faces black, and put on black clothes; as soon as the body has been buried the mourning is put off. When the tsanp'u dies, they bury men with him.\n\nThe sovereign has five or six chosen friends among his officers, who are styled comrades, and when the sovereign dies all these kill themselves to be buried with him(8).\n\nHis clothes, jewels and valuables, the horses he was in the habit of riding, his bow, sword and other weapons, all are buried at the same time. Then upon the grave a large building is erected, and a tumulus of earth thrown up, which is planted with trees as the place for ancestral worship.\n\nAfter him reigned a sovereign named Haihasitungmo; Tungmo begat T'o'tu'tu; T'utu begat Chihlishihjo; Chihli begat P'umungjo; P'umung begat Chiusijo; Chiusu begat Lunteasan; Luntean begat Ch'itsunlungtsan, also called Ch'isumung, and styled Fuyehshih.\n\nIn the 8th year of the period Chenkuan (634) the tsanp'u Ch'itsunlungtsan first sent envoys to the emperor with tribute. Lungtsan was still a minor when he succeeded to the throne. He was by nature fond of war, as well as a clever tactician, and the neighbouring states, the Yangt'ung(9), and other Ch'iang tribes, all went to him to do homage. The emperor T'aitsung despatched the envoy Feng Tehsia on a peaceful mission to him, and he received Tehsia most joyfully. Having heard that the T'uchihieh(10) and T'ukuhun(11) had both been given princesses in marriage, he sent a return mission which accompanied Tehsia on his return, with rich presents of gold and precious things and a respectful letter petitioning for a matrimonial alliance. The emperor refused. When the envoy returned, he reported to Lungtsan: \"When we first arrived at court they received us most honourably and promised a princess in marriage, but just then the T'ukuhun Prince happened to come to court and interfered to\nbreak off the negociation. Thereupon we were treated with scant ceremony, and the alliance was declined.\"\n\nLungtsan thereupon, together with the Yangt'ung, led the united armies to attack the T'ukuhun. The T'ukuhun were unable to withstand him, and fled to the banks of the Ch'inghai to escape the edge of the sword. The inhabitants and their herds were all carried off by the T'ufan. He next led on his troops, attacked and defeated the Tanghsiang(12), the Pailau(13), and other Chi'ang tribes, and at the head of an army of over 200,000 men, encamped on the western border of Sungchou(14), whence he sent envoys to the emperor, who brought as tribute a suit of gold armour, and said: \"We are come to receive the princess.\" At the same time he announced to his soldiers: \"If the great empire refuses to give me a princess in marriage, we will invade and plunder the country.\" Thereupon they advanced and assaulted Sungchou. The Governor-General Han Wei proceeded with all speed to look after the enemy, but was himself defeated by them, and the inhabitants of the frontier were in great trouble. The emperor T'aitsung despatched the President of the Board of Civil Office, Hou Ch\u00fcnchi, as Commander-in-Chief, with three other generals and an army of 50,000 horse and foot, to attack them. The general Niu Chinta led the van from Sungchou, assaulted their camp in the night and killed more than 1,000 men. Lungtsan was greatly alarmed and led his army back.\n\nFrom the date of his eastern invasion he remained several years without returning. His chief ministers begged him to come back to his own country, but he would not listen to them, whereupon eight killed themselves.\n\nHe sent a mission to apologize for his misdeeds, and again begged for an alliance. T'aitsung granted it. Lungtsan then sent his minister of state, Lutungtsan, with the presents, offering five thousand ounces of gold, and, besides, several hundred precious articles of value.\n\nIn the 15th year of Ch\u00eankuan (641), the Emperor gave the Princess Wench'eng, of the imperial house, in marriage. He appointed the President of the Board of Rites, Taotsung, Prince of Chianghsia, to preside over the ceremony, and he was given special credentials, and escorted the princess to\nT'ufan. Lungtsan led his warriors to await her arrival at Pohai, and went himself to receive her at Hoyuan. He received Taotsung most respectfully, with the rites due from a son-in-law. From this time he praised the costume of the great empire, and the perfection of their manners, and was ashamed of the barbarism of his own people. After he had returned to his own country with the princess, he addressed his relatives thus: \"Among our ancestors not one has been allied to the sovereign empire, and now that I have been honoured with the gift of a princess of the great T'ang, I esteem myself highly fortunate, and will build a walled city for the princess to proclaim my glory to after generations.\" Thereupon he built a city, and erected inside the walls a palace for her residence. As the princess disliked their custom of painting their faces red, Lungtsan ordered his people to put a stop to the practice, and it was no longer done. He also discarded his felt and skins, put on brocade and silk, and gradually copied Chinese civilization. He also sent the children of his chiefs and rich men to request admittance into the national schools to be taught the classics, and invited learned scholars from China to compose his official reports to the emperor.\n\nWhen T'aitsung returned from his expedition to Liaotung, he sent Lutungtsan on a mission of congratulation, who presented this respectful despatch: \"The holy Son of Heaven has pacified the four quarters of the world and all the states that the sun and moon shine upon are alike his obedient vassals. When Kaoli (Corea), relying on its great distance, broke off its tributary relations, the Son of Heaven himself led a million warriors across the Liao to chastise it, overthrew its cities and destroyed its armies, and after a few days has returned victorious. The barbarians had but just heard that the imperial chariot had started when the news arrived that it had reached home again. The wild goose flies most swiftly, but not when compared with the speed of the emperor. His slave and unworthy son-in-law rejoicing a hundred-fold above ordinary barbarians, in that the common goose is not unlike the wild goose, has made a gold goose,\nand respectfully offers it.\u201d This goose was moulded of pure gold, it was seven feet high, and held when full of wine about ten gallons.\n\nIn the 22nd year (648) the imperial envoy Wang Yuants\u2019\u00e8(15), who had been sent on a mission to the western countries, was plundered in Chung T\u2019ienchu. The T\u2019ufan sent an army of brave warriors, and accompanied by Yuants\u2019\u00e8 attacked T\u2019ienchu and inflicted a great defeat, and despatched envoys who brought to the emperor the news of the victory. Kaotsung had succeeded to the throne. He gave Lungtsan the title of Fuma Tuy\u00fc, appointed him Prince of Hsihai, and presented to him two thousand pieces of silk. Lungtsan replied by a letter to the ministers: \u201cThe Son of Heaven has just begun to reign, and if any one of his officers is disloyal, I will lead warriors into the country to expel and punish him.\u201d He offered also fifteen presents of gold, silver, pearl, and precious things, begging that they might be deposited before the ancestral tablet of the late emperor. Kaotsung praised him, added to his titles that of Tsungwang, and bestowed on him three thousand pieces of variously coloured silks. He then asked for silkworms\u2019 eggs, mortars and presses for making wine, and workmen to manufacture paper and ink. Everything was granted, whereupon he had a statue of himself carved in stone to be erected below the gateway of the imperial mausoleum(16).\n\nIn the first year of Yunghui (650) Lungtsan died. Kaotsung went into mourning for him, and despatched the general, Hsieny\u00fc Ch\u2019\u00eanchi, with special credentials and an autograph sealed letter, to take part in the funeral ceremonies. The son of Lungtsan died early, and his grandson succeeded to the throne with the same title of tsanp\u2019u. At this time he was quite young, and state affairs were controlled by Lutungtsan, whose surname (tribal name) was Ch\u00fcshih. Although he was ignorant of letters, yet being naturally wise, resolute, strict, and honourable, a brave warrior and skilful general, he made a most successful regent. It was due chiefly to his policy that the T\u2019ufan absorbed the Ch\u2019iang tribes, and became pre-eminent in their native land. When\nT'aitzung consented to give in marriage the Princess W\u00eanch'\u00eang, it was Lutungtsan who was sent by the tsanp'u to receive her. When he had audience the emperor asked him several questions, and was so pleased with his answers that he treated him with more ceremony than the other foreigners. He also conferred on him the title of chief general of the guards, and gave him in marriage a granddaughter of the Princess-imperial Langya, named Tuan. Lutungtsan declined the alliance, saying: \"Your slave has a wife in his own country who was chosen for him by his parents, and he could not bear to turn her away. Moreover, the tsanp'u has not yet seen the princess his bride, and his humble subject could not presume to be married first.\" T'aitzung was pleased, and wished to be still more gracious, he marvelled at his answers, but yet would not permit him to refuse.\n\nLutungtsan had five sons; the eldest named Tsanhsijo died young, next came Ch'inling, next Tsanp'o, next Hsitokan, next P'ulun. After the death of Lutungtsan, Ch'inling and his brothers succeeded him in the management of the state.\n\nAfterwards there was a quarrel with the T'ukuhun.\n\nIn the third year of Hiench'ing (658), they offered presents, including a gold basin and a gold basket, and begged for a matrimonial alliance. Soon after the T'ukuhun gave in their allegiance to China.\n\nDuring the periods Lungso and Lint\u00ea (661\u2013665) the two nations sent alternate memorials, in which each claimed to be in the right. The Chinese government temporized, and declined to judge between them. The T'ufan were dissatisfied and angry, and led troops to attack the T'ukuhun.\n\nThe T'ukuhun chief minister Suhokwei fled to T'ufan, and divulged all their weak points, so that the T'ufan succeeded in destroying his state.\n\nThe T'ukuhun were totally defeated, and the Prince of Hoyuan, Muyung Nobopo, with his consort, the Chinese Princess Hunghua, to save their lives, fled to Liangchou, and sent to the emperor the news of their calamities.\n\nThe Governor-general of Liangchou was ordered by decree to encamp troops at Liangchhou and Shanchou(17), and a large army sent to quell the disturbance. The T'ufan sent an envoy, Lunhungtsung, with a memorial detailing the misdeeds of the T'ukuhun, and the Emperor sent a mission to reprove them, whereupon envoys arrived begging a settlement of the quarrel with the T'ukuhun.\nAt the same time they asked for the Ch'ihshui territory as pastureage ground for their horses, but it was refused. During the Tungchang period (668-669), the council deliberated on the question of moving the T'ukuhun people to Liangchou beside the Nanshan. The emperor, wishing to check the invasions of the T'ufan, summoned the minister of state, Chiang K'o and Yen Lip\u00ean, with the general Ch'ipti Holi, to consult as to whether they should first attack the T'ufan. Lip\u00ean said: \"The people are famished, and war is impossible.\" Holi said: \"The T'ufan country is in the far west, and your servant fears that at the approach of our army they would fly like wild beasts and hide in the mountains, so that it would be impossible to capture and punish them. Next spring when they again attack the T'ukuhun, your servant begs you not to assist the latter so as to induce the T'ufan to doubt our power. They will thus become arrogant, and we will destroy them in one campaign.\" K'o said: \"Not so. The T'ukuhun are now weak, the T'ufan rich and powerful, and to encourage weakness to withstand powerful warriors must lead to a profitless war. If they be not succoured they will be destroyed, and your servant advises the immediate despatch of the imperial army, so that the state may not be lost. We can afterwards consult about future measures.\" They deliberated without ceasing, but did not move the T'ukuhun.\n\nIn the first year of Haiensh\u00eang (670), in the 4th month, they invaded and destroyed eighteen of the subject chou (outside the frontier), and led the people of Yutien (Khotan) to capture the Chiutzu Pohuan ch'\u00eang. Thereupon the four military governments of Anhsi were all given up. A decree appointed Hsi\u00fbeh J\u00eankuei commander-in-chief of the Loso army with two other generals, to lead over 100,000 men to chastise the enemy. The army advanced to the Tafeich'\u00fcan, and was there defeated by the T'ufan chief general, Lunch'inling. J\u00eankuei and his colleagues were all degraded. The T'ukuhun state was completely annihilated, only Mujung Nohopo, with his relatives and adherents, comprising some thousands of tents, came to offer their allegiance to China, and were removed to Liangchou. From this date the T'ufan, year after year, ravaged the frontier. The Ch'iang tribes of Tangchou and Hsichou all submitted to them.\n\nA decree appointed Chiangk'o commander-in-chief of the army of Liangchou, to go and punish them, but he died on the way, and his army returned. The T'ufan sent the minister of state, Chungtsung, to the emperor. Chungtsung, as a boy, had been a scholar in the National College, and was well versed in literature. When the emperor received him, he asked, \"If the tsanpu be compared with his grandfather, is he the more talented of the two?\" He replied, \"In valour and resolution, as well as in good policy, he is not equal, yet he is diligent in the rule of the state, and a subject would not presume to find fault with so excellent a sovereign. Moreover the T'ufan dwell in cold and misty wilds, the natural productions of which are poor and scant, and to the north of\nthe Wuhai(21) even in the height of summer snow remains. In hot weather they wear cloth, in winter fur. They follow their herds wherever there are water and grass, and in cold weather they spread their round tents within city walls, the furniture and utensils of which do not amount to one ten thousandth part of those used in China. Although the ruler and people are united, all measures are first deliberated by the people, and if advantageous to the nation they are carried out, thus conducing to durability and power.\" The emperor then said, \"The T'ukuhun and T'ufan dynasties were originally allied by marriage, yet when Shihokuei deserted his sovereign, the T'ufan employed him as an officer, and took possession of their territory. When Hsi\u00fceh Jenkwei was sent to settle the affairs of Mujiang, they also secretly attacked him, and ravaged our Liangchou. How is this?\" Chungtsung, bowing his head, replied, \"Your servant was commissioned by his sovereign to offer presents, and has no instructions about other subjects.\" The emperor approved of this answer, but seeing that Chungtsung was not an envoy plenipotentiary, he treated him with less ceremony.\n\nIn the 2nd year of Shangyuan (675) they sent the chief minister, Lunt'uhummi, to ask for peace, and also to propose a renewal of friendly relations with the T'ukuhun. The emperor would not listen.\n\nIn the 3rd year of Shangyuan (676) they invaded and plundered Shanchou and K'uochou(22), killing and carrying off people and officers.\n\nA decree appointed Ha\u00efen, Prince of Chou, with twelve generals under his command, including the President of the Board of Works, and Lien, Prince of Hsiang, with others, to lead armies to chastise them. The two princes were unsuccessful, and the T'ufan advanced and attacked Tiehchou, taking the two district cities, Mikung and Tanling. They also attacked Fuchou, and defeated the general in command. The T'ufan and the Western T'uch\u00fceh united their forces and attacked Anhsai.\n\nIn the 3rd year of Yifeng (678), Li Chingyuan was appointed Governor of Shanchou, and sent to take command at T'aocho. The bravest of the inhabitants of the provinces of Kuannui and Hotung and of the different cities were enlisted so as to collect resolute warriors without regard to former avocations, and both civil and military officers were bidden to the palace, entertained at a banquet, and sent on to the attack. The governors of Yichou and Ch\u00fcnchou were ordered to lead the soldiers and militia of the provinces of Chiennan and Shannan to assist in the defence. In the autumn of the year Li Chingyuan, accompanied by the President of the Board of Works, Liu Sh\u00eanli, led on their troops and fought a battle with the T'ufan at the Ch'inghai. The imperial army was desperately beaten and Liu Sh\u00eanli killed in the fight. Li Chingyuan halted his army, not\ndaring to go to the rescue. After he had collected his forces he encamped at the Ch'\u00eang-f\u00eang-ling, where a mud creek prevented further advance. The enemy encamped on high ground commanding his position. One of his generals, Heich'ih Ch'ang-chih, at the head of five hundred fearless warriors, stormed the hostile camp in the night; the enemy were demoralized and thrown into confusion, and over three hundred were trampled to death. Then Ching-yuan led back his army to Shanchou. He was degraded to be governor of Hengchou.\n\nIn Chiennan province the soldiers and militia built to the south-west of Maochou(23), a new city called Anjung, to defend the frontier, but shortly after the wild Ch'iang guided the T'ufan, who assaulted and took the city and garrisoned it with their own soldiers.\n\nAt this time the T'ufan acquired all the territory of the Yangt'ung, Tanghsiang, and different Ch'iang tribes, so that on the east they touched the chou cities of Liang, Sung, Mao and Ch\u00fcn(24), on the south stretched to P'olom\u00ean(25), on the west they had besieged and captured the four military governments Chintz\u016d, Sulo and the rest, while on the north they were bounded by the T'uchhueh. Their country extended over more than ten thousand li, and from the Han and Wei dynasties downwards there had been no people among the nations of the west so powerful.\n\nThe Emperor Kaotsung, when he received the intelligence of the defeat and death of Sh\u00eanli and the rest, called a cabinet council to consult on the question of peace or war. Kuo Ch\u00eangyi said: \"The T'ufan have been a thorn in our side for many years, generals have been commissioned and armies sent in annual succession, so that our soldiers and horses are distressed and our grain and stores exhausted. A punitive invasion would be a vain tax on the strength of our troops, it would be impossible to pursue them to their lair. I beg that only a few troops and militia be sent, enough to guard the frontier, to light the watch fires, and prevent plundering. If we wait till the national resources are replenished and men's minds at rest, after a few years have passed we shall be\nable to destroy them in one expedition.\" The others agreed on the advisability of garrisoning the frontier.\n\nSoon after Heich'ih Ch'angchih defeated the T'ufan chief general Tsanp'o and Subokuei at Liangfeich'uan, killing and making prisoners over 2,000 men. T'ufan then retreated. An imperial decree appointed Ch'angchih Commander of the Hoyuan army to garrison the country against them.\n\nAccording to the memoir of Kaotsung Ch'angchih fought the battle at Liangfeich'uan in the 1st year of Yunglung (689), and it ought not to come before the 4th year of Yifeng (679), so that the official document must have got misplaced here.\n\nIn the 4th year of Yifeng (679), the tsanp'u died. His son, Ch'inhuhsilung, succeeded to the throne with the same title of tsanp'u. He was eight years old at the time, and the government of the state was still in the hands of Ch'inling. He sent the chief minister, Lunhant'iaopang, who brought the news of the death of the tsanp'u, and also asked for peace. Kaotsung commissioned the general Sung Lingwen to proceed to Fan to assist at the funeral.\n\nIn the 1st year of Yunglung (680), the Princess Wench'eng died. Kaotsung despatched another envoy to take part in the funeral ceremony.\n\nHe brought back with him the body of our Ch'en Hsingyen. When Hsingyen was sent on a mission to the enemy, Lunh'ining wanted him to bow down, and threatened him with the sword, but he refused to kneel. They detained him ten years, and now his body was brought back. He was canonized as governor of Muchou. Tsanp'o again invaded as far as Liangfeich'uan, where Ch'angchih attacked and drove him away.\n\nWhen the Empress Te'st'ien ruled, she appointed the minister, Wei Taichia, commander-in-chief, with the governor-general of Anhai, Yen Wenku, as his deputy. In the 1st year of Yungch'ang (689), they led troops to attack the T'ufan, but after delaying long, made no way. He was punished by banishment to Hsiuchou, and Wenku was beheaded. Taichia had no military capacity, and proved himself helpless and incompetent, so that his soldiers were famished, and all wandered about to die in ditches. The year after the minister, Te'eng Ch'angch'ien, was appointed to chief command against the T'ufan, but returned after going half way, so that his army never reached.\nIn the 1st year of Juyi (692), the T'ufan chief Hosu, at the head of his own followers, together with the tribes of Kweich'uan, and 30,000 of the Tanghsiang, offered his allegiance. Ts\u00ea't'ien ordered the general Chang Yuany\u00fc to lead 20,000 picked warriors to receive him. The army waited for him at the Tatu river, but Hosu's project had leaked out, and he had been carried off to his own country. Another chief, Tseanch'ui, at the head of over 8,000 of the Ch'iang and Man tribes, came to Yuany\u00fc to offer submission. Yuany\u00fc established in their country the Yehch'uanchoh, and appointed Tseanch'ui governor. Finally, on the hill to the west of the Tatu, he carved in stone a record of his fame and returned.\n\nIn the 1st year of Ch'angshou (692), the commander-in-chief, Wang Hsiaochieh, inflicted a great defeat on the T'ufan army, and re-conquered the four military governments Chintz'hi, Y\u00fcti\u00ean, Sul\u00ea and Suiyeh. There was then established at Chintz'hi, the governor-general of Anhsi(26), and troops were sent to garrison the city.\n\nIt was advised in council to abolish these four ch\u00ean, and give up the country, but Ts'ei Sung presented this memorial: \"For a long time have the barbarians been dangerous to our central state. The five ancient emperors and the three dynasties did not subdue them. The Han, with an army of a million men, invested P'ingch'\u00eang, and afterwards, the emperor Weni, with determined resolution, pacified the barbarians of the four quarters. Chang Ch'ien first penetrated to the countries of the west, established four garrisons, and fortified two passes, cutting off the right arm of the Hsiungnu. Gradually the Ho and Huang were crossed, and a city, Lingchi, was built as a defence against the southern Ch'iang. Then barriers, guard-houses, towers, and smoke-fires, extended several thousand li beyond the Great Wall. The treasuries were emptied, soldiers and horses exhausted, and envoys despatched in yearly and monthly succession, till money was made of leather, and coins reckoned by the string, while boats and carts were taxed, and duties levied on wine distillers, all with the view of keeping up the above permanently. Thus were the Hsiungnu compelled to flee alone to distant parts, the western countries opened up, and officers appointed to rule them. When the Emperor Kungwu re-established the dynasty, all again gave in their allegiance; and during the following century there were three breaks and three renewals of intercourse. Our own Emperor T'ai-tsung, following in the old footsteps of the Han, ruled the southern mountains as far as the Tsungling range, and divided the country into cities and districts, so that watch-fires blazed throughout, and the T'ufan dared not trouble the empire. In the reign of Kaotung the generals were feeble, the four ch\u00ean were lost and abandoned, and the T'ufan waxed strong, and invaded to the west...\"\nof Yench'i(27), their long drums advancing on the right beyond Kaoch'ang, while they passed Ch\u00fcehih, plundered Ch'angl\u00ea, cut off the Mohoyench'i, and penetrated to T'unhuang(28). Now Hsiaoch'ieh, in one expedition, has reconquered the four ch\u00ean, and re-established the old boundaries of the late emperor, and if all be given up, his finished work will be destroyed, and his excellent policy upset. If the four ch\u00ean be not garrisoned, the foreign warriors will invade the western countries; and if these be disturbed, the southern Ch'iang will be attacked in turn; and should these join, our province of Hoehi will be in difficulties. Moreover, the Mohoyench'i is a desert 2000 li wide, with no water nor grass, and should the north become a prey to the enemy, the T'ang armies will not be able to cross to the north, and then the natives of Yi, Hsi, Peit'ing(29), and Anhsii will all be lost.\" This led to the rejection of the advice of the council.\n\nThen the chief, P'uluntsan, accompanied by the usurping K'ohan of the T'uch\u00fceh, Ashina T'otai, invaded from the south, and fought a battle with Hsiaoch'ieh at Lingeht'uan, where they were defeated and driven away. The governor of Suiyeh despatched Han Saichung, who destroyed the city Nishumus\u00ea.\n\nIn the 1st year of Wansuit'engf\u00eang, Hsiaoch'ieh was appointed commander-in-chief, and fought with the T'ufan generals, Lunch'inling and Tsanp'o, at the Sulahanshan, where the imperial army was totally defeated. Hsiaoch'ieh was, in consequence, stripped of his rank.\n\nIn the 1st year of Wansuit'ungt'ien (696) a T'ufan army of over 40,000 men suddenly appeared under the walls of Liangchhou. The governor, taken completely by surprise, hurriedly came out at the head of his troops and engaged the enemy. The battle lasted long, until their strength was exhausted, and they were slain by the rebels.\n\nAt this time the T'ufan sent another mission to ask for peace. The Empress was inclined to grant it, but Lunch'inling asked also for the withdrawal of the troops from the four ch\u00ean of Anhsii, and also for a gift of the territory of the Ten Hordes(30).\n\nThe Empress despatched Kuo Yuanch\u00ean on a mission to them. On the road he met Chi'nling, and said to him: \"Tungtsan was loyal to the empire and never broke his oath of fealty, but you are now become hostile, and yearly harass the frontier. Your father was friendly, and his son is an enemy. Is this filial piety? Your father was faithful, and his son is a traitor. Is this loyalty?\" Chi'nling replied: \"Certainly! but were the Son of Heaven to grant peace, the armies of both countries would be disbanded; and were he to allow the Ten hordes of the T'uch\u00fceh and the four ch\u00ean to appoint their own rulers, the countries would defend themselves. How would this do?\" Yuanch\u00ean said: \"The T'ang use the Ten hordes and the four ch\u00ean to control the western countries as a road for the sovereigns of the different states, and for no other\npurpose. Moreover, these people have no kinship with the T'ufan, while they have long been frontier subjects of the T'ang.\" Ch'inling replied: \"Does the minister think that I wish to sever these people so as to be enabled to harass the frontier of the T'ang? If I coveted territory and revenues, Ch'inghai and Huangch'uan are much nearer, and should I not rather strive after this land? The T'uchih tribes have stony deserts and broad steppes, and are very far distant from our central kingdom, and it is not likely that land 10,000 li away would be coveted. Moreover, the foreigners on all sides have been subdued and absorbed by the T'ang till even beyond the ocean no land has escaped destruction. T'ufan alone remains, and only because I and my brothers are diligent and united in protecting our country. Of the Ten hordes the Fire ch'o are near Anhui, but far from T'ufan, while the Sutchin are separated from us by one desert only, which horsemen can canter across in ten days, so that there is ground for anxiety here. At Wuhai and Huangho the passes and rivers make formidable obstacles, and the land is pestilential, so that the T'ang cannot penetrate, whereas, on the other side, feeble generals and unarmed troops would be dangerous to Fan; hence my anxiety to acquire this territory; it is not with an eye to these tribes. The road to Kanchou and Liangchou is 2000 li across the Chishih desert, which at its broadest is only some hundreds of li across, at its narrowest only one hundred, so that if we come from Changyeh and Y\u00fcmen we shall prevent the empire from sowing in the spring or reaping in the autumn, and in some five or six years succeed in cutting off its root. Now we do not intend to do this, so that you need not be anxious about us. After the war at Ch'inghai, Huang Jenau made a treaty of peace, and frontier guards were removed, whereupon Te'ui Chihiien crossed Sutchin and carried off ten thousand of our oxen and sheep. I ask you about this.\" The envoys he sent strongly urged his request, but Yuanchen answered as firmly that it could not be granted.\n\nThe Empress altogether refused to grant this. In T'ufan, from the time when Lunch'inling and his brothers had sole control of the troops, Ch'inling always resided in the centre in charge of affairs, while his younger brothers divided the rule of the outlying countries. Tsanp'o governed the eastern frontier, and was next neighbour to China, and for more than thirty years was a constant danger to the border. The brothers were all men of power and genius, and the Fan people feared them. In the 2nd year of Shengli (699) the tsanp'u Ch'inhusilung, having come to years of discretion, held a secret council with his chief minister, Lanyen, and others, at a time when Ch'inling was abroad. The tsanp'u then announced that he was going on a hunting expedition, collected warriors, and having taken over 2000 of the relatives and confederates of Ch'inling, put them to death. He then sent messengers to summon Ch'inling, Tsanp'o, and the rest. Ch'inling collected troops, and refused to obey the\nsummons, whereupon the tsanp'u himself led an army to chastise him. Ch'ining was deserted by his troops before the battle, and he killed himself, while more than a hundred of his relatives and intimate adherents committed suicide on the same day. Tsanp'o, at the head of over a thousand of his people, accompanied by his brothers, including Mangpu-chih, came to offer allegiance. The Empress Ts\u00ea'tien sent some swift horsemen of the imperial guard to meet them outside the city. She appointed Tsanp'o Prince of Kueit\u00ea, with the rank of general, and Mangpu-chih Duke of Ankuo, giving to each an iron tablet of office, and rewarding them with many valuable presents. She afterwards ordered Tsanp'o to lead his warriors to Hungyuanku to take part in the fight. Shortly after he died, and was canonized by special decree as Governor-general of Anhs\u00ee.\n\nIn the 1st year of Chinsih (700) the T'ufan again sent one of their generals, Ch'\u00fcmangpu-chih, who invaded Liang-chou, and closely invested Ch'angeunghsien. The governor-general of the armies and cities of Lungyu, T'ang Hsiuching, fought a battle with Mangpu-chih at Hungyuanku, and killed two of his lieutenant-generals and 2500 men.\n\nIn the 2nd year of Ch'angan (702) the tsanp'u, at the head of an army of over 10,000 men, invaded Hsiuchou. The governor, Ch'\u00ean Tatz'\u00fc, fought in all four battles with the rebels, defeated them on each occasion, and cut off more than 1000 heads. Thereupon the T'ufan sent Lunmisa and others on a mission to the imperial court to beg for peace. The Empress entertained them in one of the halls of the palace, and exhibited a hundred games in the courtyard. Lunmisa said, \"Your servant was born in border wastes, and has never heard before the music of China; may your servant be permitted to look more closely?\" The Empress allowed his request. Thereupon Lunmisa and his colleagues all laughed and danced for joy. He bowed his thanks, saying, \"Your slave kneels to your sacred Majesty, who has treated him from first to last with magnificent ceremony, and also allowed him a close inspection of wonderful music, such as he has\nnever seen in his life. He is a mean thing, of no account, and how can he look up to acknowledge celestial favour? He can only wish in his heart that your great house may endure for a myriad years.\"\n\nThe next year they sent another mission with a thousand horses and two thousand ounces of gold, to beg for a matrimonial alliance. The Empress granted it. At this time the subject states on the southern border of T'ufan, Nep\u0101l(31), and P'olom\u0113n (Central India), both revolted, and the tsanp'u went himself to punish them, but died during the war. His sons disputed for the throne a long time, till the people elected the son of Ch'inuhsilung, Ch'ilisotsan, to be tsanp'u, who was at the time seven years old. In the reign of Chungtsung, in the 1st year of Sh\u0113nlung (705), a T'ufan mission arrived to announce the death of their ruler. The emperor went into mourning for him, and closed the court for one day.\n\nThey again sent the chief minister, Hsitungj\u0113ku, to ask for a matrimonial alliance. No reply was given. Li Chihku had proposed to attack the Man tribes of Yaochou(32), so as to cut off the T'ufan guides, and, in obedience to a decree, had led the Chienman levies against them. The Man chief reported the affair to the enemy, killed Chihku, offering his body in sacrifice to heaven, and invaded Shu Han. A decree appointed T'ang Chiuch\u0113ng commander of the army of Yaochou and Chiunchou, to lead an army to attack them. The enemy had bridged the river Yangpi (Chinsha R.) with iron chains as a means of communication with the Hsi Erh Man, and built a walled city to protect the bridge. Chiuch\u0113ng broke the chains and levelled the walls, and erected an iron pillar on the T'iench'ih (lake), engraved with a record of his prowess.\n\nIn the 2nd year of Chinglung (708) the mission of alliance was sent back. Some proposed that, as they had come to receive a princess, and besides to learn the Chinese language, they should not be sent back, but the Emperor replied that China must be just in its relations with barbarians, and refused.\n\nSoon afterwards the grandmother of the tsanp'u sent the chief minister, Hsitungj\u0113, who offered to the Emperor productions of the country, and asked for a matrimonial alliance for her grandson. Chungtsung gave his adopted child the daughter of Shouli, prince of Yung, with the title of Princess of Chinch'eng. From this date tribute was offered every year. In the 3rd year of Chinglung (709), in the 11th month, they sent a mission headed by the chief minister Shangtsanch'o (whose surname was Hsila), to receive the\nbride. The Emperor entertained them in the ball-grounds within the park, and ordered his own son-in-law Yang Sh\u00eanhiao to play with the T'ufan envoy at the ball-game, Chungtsung at the head of his Court looking on.\n\nIn the 1st month of the 4th year (710), the Emperor wrote, \"The sages spread civilization with the welfare of the people in their hearts, the kings of old extended benevolence to the eight points of the compass without excluding foreigners, so that their fame was diffused far and near and all things flourished. Afterwards the glorious Chou ruled the empire and adopted measures for conciliating distant people. When the powerful Han flourished they originated a policy of peace and alliance with special view to permanence, and they are an excellent model for imperial rulers. We have received from the spirits above the rule of the empire, and are anxious to follow the good deeds of our predecessors and institute a lasting concord. As regards the T'ufan, their abode is in the west country, from which, soon after the rise of our imperial house, they came early with tribute. The learned, warlike and holy Emperor T'aitsung, whose virtue was wide as heaven and earth, with anxious care for the myriads of his people, determined to put away weapons and armour, and maintain relations of alliance and friendship, and for some tens of years the world was calm and peaceful. Since this time, when the Princess W\u00eanc'h'\u00eang went and civilized this country, many of their customs have been changed. But our borders have been constantly full of troops, and their Fan tribes have often experienced loss and disaster. Now however the tsanp'u, and the k'otun(33) his grandmother, and the chiefs have for several years shown true submission, and with a view to cement the ancient bonds of kinship they now ask to renew friendship. The Princess of Chinch'\u00eang is our little daughter, and we are very fond of her, but, as the father and mother of our subjects, we compassionate the black-haired people; and, as by granting their request and strengthening the bonds of peace, the border lands will be untroubled and the officers and soldiers at rest, we sever the bond of affection for the good of the\nstate. We found for her a foreign home, and with due employment of all ceremony bestow her on the T'ufan tsanp'u. In this present month the cort\u00e8ge will start, and we purpose ourselves to accompany it outside the city.\"\n\nThe Emperor ordered Chi Ch'una to escort the princess, as the Prince of Chianghsia formerly did on the occasion of the marriage of the Princess W\u00eanc'h'\u00eang, but he declined to go. A second appointment was made with the same result, until finally the general Yang Ch\u00fc was despatched. In the same month the Emperor proceeded to Shihp'inghsien to escort the princess, and the imperial tent was pitched beside the Paich'ingp'a, where he entertained the princes and high ministers and the T'ufan envoy at a banquet, during which, when the wine had circulated, he called the T'ufan envoy to the front, and told him what a young child the princess was, and how he had severed the bonds of love to send her to be married so far away. The sovereign wept and sobbed for a long time.\n\nThe presents were several tens of thousand pieces of brocaded and plain silks, and comprised various kinds of apparatus, with skilled workmen, as well as Chintz'\u00fc musical instruments.\n\nHe then commanded the ministers of his court to compose farewell verses. He specially pardoned the Shihp'inghsien criminals, and remitted the taxes of the inhabitants for one year. He changed the name of Shihp'inghsien to Chinch'\u00eanghsien, the lake to Phunin lake, and ordered the spot to be called henceforward the place of sad parting. After the princess had reached T'ufan, they built a new city for her residence.\n\nWhen Chang Yuanpiao was governor-general of Anhsi, he frequently attacked and plundered the northern borders of the T'ufan. They were inwardly very angry in consequence, although outwardly all was peace. When Yang Ch\u00fc was governor of Shanchou, the T'ufan sent envoys to him with many valuable presents, and asked for the Chiuch'\u00fc(34) territory in Hohsi, as dowry for the princess of Chinch'\u00eang. Ch\u00fc then wrote a memorial to recommend that it should be given. Thus the T'ufan gained possession of Chiuch'\u00fc, a fertile and rich territory, where they could encamp troops and\npasture their herds, which was also close to the T'ang border, and from this time they again revolted and began to lead warriors to invade and plunder.\n\nIn the 2nd year of K'iayuan (714),\n\nTheir minister F\u00eantayen sent a letter to the ministers of state to ask them to conclude a sworn treaty fixing the boundary at Hoyuan, and proposed the officer Hsieh Wan to be sent for the purpose. The Emperor ordered Yao Ch'ung and his colleague to answer the despatch, and appointed Hsieh Wan to take the treaty of the Sh\u00eanlung period to them. The T'ufan afterwards sent the historiographer Shangch'insang, named Haila, to offer to the emperor the text of the treaty, but it was not concluded.\n\nIn the autumn, the T'ufan generals F\u00eantayen and Ch'ilihsiu, at the head of an army of over 100,000 men, plundered Lint'aoch\u00fcn, and also invaded and plundered Lanchou and Weichou, carrying off with them the government sheep and horses. Yang Ch'\u00fc, repentant and afraid, killed himself by drinking poison. The Emperor Yuantsung appointed Hsiuh No commander-in-chief in Lungyu, with Wang Ch\u00fcn to lead troops to attack them in the rear; and issued a decree to collect a large army for him to go in person to chastise them. The generals and warriors were enlisted, and the day fixed for the start. Meanwhile, however, Ch\u00fcn and the rest fell in with the robbers at Wuchiehyi in Weiyuan. The general in command of the van, Wang Haiping, was killed fighting bravely, but Ch\u00fcn advanced at the head of his troops, and inflicted a great defeat on the T'ufan army, killing some tens of thousands and recovering all the sheep and horses that they were carrying off. The remnant of the enemy fled to the north and died in heaps, one followed on the other, so that the current of the T'ao river was stopped. The sovereign then gave up his project of proceeding himself, and appointed Ni Joshui to go to report on the condition of the army, and also to sacrifice at the funeral of Wang Haiping before his return. The T'ufan sent their chief minister Tsung\u00eayintzi to the T'ao river to sacrifice to their dead and lost warriors, and also to call at the barrier to ask for peace, which the Emperor refused.\n\nThe ministers of state reported as follows: The T'ufan originally had the (Yellow) river as the boundary, but on account of the princess the river was bridged, a walled city built, and two camps established at Tushan and Chiuch'\u00fc,\n200 li distant from Chishih. Now that they have broken the treaty, we propose to destroy the bridge, and again guard the river according to treaty. A decree was issued accordingly. The general Weich'ih Huai was despatched as envoy to T'ufan to calm the fears of the princess.\n\nFrom this date they annually harassed the borders. Kuo Chihyin and Wang Chun were in turn appointed Governor-general of Hohsi to oppose them. The T'ufan, exulting in the strength of their warriors, whenever they sent despatches to court, asked for the ceremonies of equal nations, and used rude and disrespectful language, so that the Emperor was very angry.\n\nA mission came as far as Lint'ao, but a decree refused them admittance. The Princess of Chinch'eng sent a letter to ask the Emperor to listen to them and to renew friendly relations, concluding with the words: \"The tsanp'u and his officers wish to make a sworn treaty and to engrave it on stone.\" The T'ufan sent another mission to the Emperor with this despatch: \"The Emperor Hsiaoho granted a sworn treaty, and at that time the T'ang ministers of state, Lu Ch'in-wang, Wei Yuanchung, Li Chiao, Chi Ch'un and others, in all twenty-two persons, concluded a sworn ceremony with the T'ufan sovereign and officers. When the Emperor Hsiaoho died and the exalted Emperor succeeded, he kept up peaceful relations as of old. But the chief ministers of the T'ang, whose names are engraved on the treaty, are all dead, and the present ministers do not follow the former treaty; therefore it is necessary to repeat the ceremony. The envoy Lunch'il and others, from first to last seven missions, have been sent, but we have not been honoured with a favourable reply. Moreover, Chang Yuanpiao and Li Chikhu have led troops to plunder and oppress the state of your son-in-law, so that the oaths have been broken and war ensued. Should my father-in-law be pleased to wash away and pardon bygone faults, and let all be merged in a great peace, your son-in-law will keep it faithfully. But if the sworn ceremony be not repeated, there will be no trust; and we are waiting to make a new oath. Your son-in-law himself manages state affairs, and leaves nothing to subordinates, and he is anxious to give to the people a lasting peace. Although my father-in-law is at peace with us, yet his heart is at variance with his words. Why is this?\" He also said: \"My father-in-law blames Ch'ilhshii for enlisting warriors, but these were only new soldiers sent to replace old, and they were not specially enlisted. Formerly, all the border land was neutral from Paishui, until lately the general Kuo encamped troops there and built a walled city, and your son-in-law in consequence also erected a city. If there be peace between the two countries, these will be available for the reception of missions, if there be no intercourse for guarding the frontier. He is also suspicious of our friendship with the Tuchieh Kueh'olu(35). Our intercourse is of long standing, and our houses were once allied, but now there is no communication.\" He sent precious vases and cups as offerings. The Emperor replied: \"When the old alliance was made, the document was drawn up, and it will be sufficient to keep this old sworn treaty;\" and he refused to allow a new ceremony. Having entertained the envoy, he sent him back with valuable gifts for the tsanp'u. From this time they sent yearly tribute, and did not trouble the borders.\nIn the 10th year (722) they attacked the small Pulu state, the sovereign of which, Muchinnang, sent a letter to Chang Haisoung, the governor-general of Peit'ing, in which he said: \"Pulu is the west gate of the T'ang, and if it be lost the states of the western country will all be subdued by the T'ufan. Your Excellency must devise a plan to prevent this.\" Haisoung assented, and sent the lieutenant-governor of Sul\u00ea Kashyar Chang Setli with 4000 foot and horse. They marched night and day, joined the army of Muchinnang, and attacked the T'ufan on two sides, killing some tens of thousands, capturing many suits of armour, weapons, horses and sheep, and recovering all the old territory of the nine cities which had been lost. When the Pulu prince first came to the imperial court, he treated the Emperor as his own father, and after returning to his country he established the Suiyuanch\u00fcn to oppose the T'ufan, and then resulted constant battles every year. The T'ufan always said: \"We do not covet your state, but only want to borrow a road to attack the four ch\u00ean.\" On this account, for a succession of years, they sent no armies. Thereupon, the governor-general of Lungyu Wang Chi\u00fcnp'i proposed a deep invasion by way of retaliation. In the 12th year (724) he defeated the T'ufan, and presented captives to the Emperor.\n\nThen he sacrificed to the mountains. When the ceremony was over, the high officer Chang Yueh memorialized: \"The T'ufan are hostile and rebellious, and deserve to be destroyed by the myriad. But another punitive expedition would surely result in distress and loss. For ten years and more the soldiers of Kan, Liang, Ho, and Shan have been marched and sent abroad without ceasing, and although they have been victorious, yet there has been no opportunity to recuperate the losses. I hear that they have repented of their misdeeds and beg for peace, and trust that your majesty will despatch envoys to accept their kotous of submission so as to give rest to the borders, that the black-haired race may prosper accordingly.\" The Emperor replied: \"Wait till we have consulted Wang Chi\u00fcnp'i.\" Yueh, as he went out, said to Yuan Chi'enyo: \"Chi\u00fcnp'i is brave, but devoid of judgment, and thinks himself capable of anything. If there be peace between the two countries, how can he acquire fame? As soon as he comes and details his plans, my advice will be disregarded.\" Chi\u00fcnp'i afterwards had audience and memorialized on the subject, begging to send troops to invade their country deeply and punish them.\n\nIn the 1st month of the 15th year (727) Chi\u00fcnp'i led an army and defeated the T'ufan to the west of the Ch'inghai (Kokonor), and returned carrying off their\nbaggage waggons, sheep, and horses. Before this, the T'ufan general Hsinolo, at the head of an army, had invaded and attacked Tatonku, and he afterwards marched to assault Kanchou, burning towns and villages. Ch\u00fcnp'i was afraid of their prowess, and dared not go out to fight. Meanwhile, there was a great fall of snow, and a large number of the rebels were frozen to death, so that they retired by the west road of the Chishihch\u00fcn. Ch\u00fcnp'i had previously ordered men to go secretly into the enemy's borders and burn all the grass along the road by which they were returning, so that when the retreating army of Hsinolo reached Tafeich'uan, and the warriors put off their armour and turned out their horses, the herbage was all destroyed, and more than half of the horses were starved to death. Ch\u00fcnp'i, with the governor of Ch'inchou and others, led troops to attack them in the rear, and pursued them as far as the west of the Ch'inghai. The water of the sea was frozen at the time, and the troops marched across upon the ice. At the same time, Hsinolo had crossed the Tafeich'uan, having left behind on the banks of the Ch'inghai his baggage waggons, and disabled soldiers. Ch\u00fcnp'i let loose his troops, and returned with the captives and booty.\n\nIn the 9th month of the same year the T'ufan generals, Hsinolo Kunglu and Chulung Mangpuchih, assaulted and destroyed the city of Kuachou(37), capturing the governor, T'ien Yuanhsien, and Shou, the father of Ch\u00fcnp'i. They carried off the army stores and provisions from the city, demolished the walls and then returned. They next attacked the Y\u00fcmen garrison, and Ch'anglohsien, the governor of which city, Chia Shihshun, bravely defended it for 80 days until they retired.\n\nOn the way back they ravaged Anhsai. The lieutenant-governor, Chao Yich\u00ean, attacked, and drove them away.\n\nSoon after, Wang Ch\u00fcnp'i was killed by one of the tribes of the Huiho (Ouigours). The Emperor appointed the President of the Board of War, Hsiao Sung, governor-general of Hohsi, and commissioned the general, Chang Shoukuei, appointed governor of Kuachou, to rebuild the\ncity walls, and call back the inhabitants to resume their former occupations. At this time the fame and prowess of Hsinolo Kunglu was much dreaded, and Hsiao Sung sent back deserters to T'ufan to report that he was in secret communication with China, whereupon the tsanp'u recalled, and put him to death.\n\nNext year in the autumn the T'ufan general Hsimolang led another army to attack Kuachou, the governor of which led out his troops and drove them back. The governor-general of Lungyu, governor of Shanchou, Chang Chihliang, led troops to K'opoku on the S.W. of the Chi'inghai, and fought there a battle with the T'ufan, greatly defeating them. Soon after the infantry and cavalry of the armies of Chishih and Mom\u00ean came up together and united with Chibliang in the pursuit. They captured the city of Tamom\u00ean, taking over 1000 prisoners, capturing 1000 horses, 500 yaks and a large quantity of material, weapons, clothes and property. They afterwards burnt the Lotoch'iao (camel bridge) and returned.\n\nIn the 8th month he again sent the lieutenant-general Tu Pink'o with 4000 crossbow-men, who engaged the T'ufan under the walls of the city of Ch'lien and fought from morn to sunset, separating and again meeting in battle, the rebels suffering severe loss, while their assistant-general was killed. Five thousand heads were presented. The rebels defeated fled in confusion into the mountains, and cries of lamentation resounded from the four quarters. When the Emperor first heard of the repeated invasions of the T'ufan, he said to the ministers of his court: \"The T'ufan, overbearing and blood-thirsty, are come, presuming on their strength. We have just examined the maps of the country, to find the strong and weak points, and ourselves indicated them to the generals in command, and they will surely be defeated.\" In a few days the open despatch (to announce victory) arrived.\n\nIn the 17th year (729) the commander-in-chief of Sofang, Wei, Prince of Hsinan, led another army to Lungyu and captured their Shhip'uch'heng(38), cutting off over 400 heads and taking over 200 prisoners. He then garrisoned the\ncity of Shihp'u and presented the captives bound at the imperial ancestral temple.\n\nThe Emperor wrote a despatch to the general P'ei Ming, in which he said: \"Should any one dare to hide fame acquired in battle and prevent its being rewarded, let the warrior himself report it, and the general and civil officer shall both be executed. If any hang back from the fight, the whole rank shall be punished by martial law. The successful capturer of the prince shall be appointed a chief general.\" Thereupon the warriors pressed on yet more bravely. The T'ufan sent a Nangku (a civil officer) to present this letter at the barrier: \"Lummangj\u00e9 and Lunch'j\u00e9, both commanders of 10,000 men, have been commissioned by the tsanp'u to ask pardon of the governor. Our two nations are allied by bonds of affinity, but yesterday the Mipunung Ch'iang and the Tanghsiang quarrelled, and in consequence our two nations lost their good understanding. We did not listen, the T'ang also ought not to listen. Let the governor send a confidential officer to return with the nangku to discuss a sworn treaty.\"\n\nThereupon the T'ufan sent successive missions to ask for peace. Yu Prince of Chung and Huangfu Weiming reported on the subject and personally pressed the advantages of friendly intercourse. The Emperor replied: \"The T'ufan tsanp'u sent to us the other year a despatch couched in disrespectful and improper terms, and we resolved to punish him. How then can there be peace?\" Weiming answered: \"In the beginning of the present reign the tsanp'u was still a child and could not have behaved in this way. It must have been the general in command of the frontier army, who, wishing to gain temporary fame, forged this letter to excite the anger of your Majesty. The two nations then broke off relations, and armies were set in motion which gained temporary advantage, and they then privately took credit for themselves and sent false reports of their achievements to plot for official promotion. Thus many myriads were wasted and with no gain to the state, and now the people of Hohsi and Lungyu are sick and famished, all from this cause. May your Majesty be pleased to despatch a mission to visit the Princess of Chinch'eng, and to conclude a treaty of peaceful alliance with the tsanp'u personally, ordering him to bow down in acknowledgment of vassalage, and thereby confer lasting tranquillity on the borders. This policy would give peace to the people for long ages.\" The Emperor approved his words, and sent Weiming and\nthe eunuch Chang Yuanfang on a mission of inquiry to the T'ufan.\n\nWeiming and Yuanfang went to T'ufan, and when they had seen the tsamp'u and the princess, they made known the resolution of the Emperor. The tsamp'u and the rest were rejoiced that their request for peace had been accepted, and produced all the imperial despatches they had received from the period Ch\u00eankuan downwards, for the inspection of Weiming. He ordered his high minister, Minghsilieh, to accompany Weiming and his colleagues to court, and to present this humble despatch: \"Your son-in-law's relationship with his father-in-law is of long standing, being derived from a former emperor, and he has, moreover, been honoured with the gift of the princess of Chinch'\u00eang, so that we were allied as one family, and all people under heaven enjoyed the blessings of peace. Meanwhile, however, Chang Yuanpiao and La Chihku, both in the east and west, first moved soldiers and horses, and invaded and plundered T'ufan, and consequently, the frontier generals have been constantly attacking each other, and down to the present day there have been battle and strife. Your nephew, on account of the aforetime Princess W\u00eanc'h'\u00eang, and of the present Princess of Chinch'\u00eang, is deeply mindful of the duties of relationship, and would not dare to be disrespectful. But when quite young he was deceived by the generals on the frontier, who concocted quarrels and disturbance; he submits to the correction of his father-in-law, and begs him to investigate the affair in virtue of the ancient alliance; ten thousand deaths would be a sufficient atonement. He has before sent several envoys to the imperial court, but all have been turned back by the frontier generals. Therefore he did not dare to send a memorial himself, but last winter the Princess sent as envoy Louchungshihjo on a special mission, and the envoy sent in return to see the princess has been gratefully received. Your son-in-law, rejoiced beyond measure at this mark of favour, sends as bearer of this letter Minghsilieh, with the general Lianghsiehhoeyeh as assistant envoy. When Minghsilieh is admitted to audience, he will report clearly\nas to what shall be kept or dropped, he being conversant with the political relations of the two countries. Your son-in-law will give clear instructions to the frontier generals of the Fan that plunder and robbery are forbidden, and that if any subjects of the Han come for refuge they are immediately to be sent back. He beseechingly implores the Emperor, his father-in-law, to search from afar his red heart, and to grant a renewal of old friendship, so as to confer lasting rest and joy on the people. Should he be the recipient of sacred grace, for thousands and tens of thousands of years your son-in-law will surely not dare to be the first to break the sworn covenant. He reverently offers a gold wine vase, a gold plate, a gold bowl, an agate wine cup, and a piece of goat\u2019s hair cloth, as a small tribute from a mean country. The Princess of Chinch\u2019\u00eang also presents separately a gold duck, plate, bowl, and other articles.\u201d\n\nIn the 18th year (730), the 10th month, Minghsilieh and the rest arrived at the capital. The Emperor received them in the Hs\u00fcanch\u00eang palace, surrounded by his armed guards. Minghsilieh was a scholar learned in literature; he had been before to Ch\u2019angan to receive the Princess of Chinch\u2019\u00eang, and at that occasion all the court talked of his ability and eloquence. On his arrival, the Emperor invited him to a banquet in the palace, conversed with him, and treated him most graciously, presenting to him a purple robe and gold girdle with fish-bag, as well as seasonable apparel, a silver plate and wine vase; and afterwards entertained him sumptuously at a separate hotel. Hsilieh kept the robe and girdle as well as the other presents, but declined the fish-bag, excusing himself thus: \u201cIn our native country we do not wear this, and I dare not keep such a new and rare gift.\u201d The Emperor approved and consented. He appointed Ts\u2019ui Lin to proceed on a mission of reply and congratulation.\n\nThey also asked to be allowed to barter horses at Ch\u2019ihling(39), and to have an exchange mart established at Kansungling. The minister P\u2019ei Kuang\u2019ting reported \u201cKansung is an important defence to China; let it be rather Ch\u2019ihling.\u201d\n\nAt Ch\u2019ihling both nations erected boundary monuments, and made a covenant never to encroach beyond.\n\nAt the same time the Tufan envoy memorialized: \u201cThe\nPrincess begs for a copy of the Mao Shih, Liohi, Tsochuan and Wenhsian,\" and a decree was issued, ordering the officers in charge to write and give them. Y\u00fc Hsiulieh presented this memorial of remonstrance: \"Your servant has heard that the barbarians are plunderers of the state. The classics and records contain the statutes of the state. The inborn nature of the barbarians must not be left unchecked. The statutes contain constant laws, and ought not to be given away. The Chuan says, 'The barbarians are not plotting against and troubling China, therefore it is necessary to curb their wicked hearts, and if they be guarded against, there will be no cause for sorrow.' Formerly, when the Tungping Wang came to court and asked for the Shihchi and the works of the philosophers, the Emperor of the Han dynasty refused to give them, because in the Shihchi there was much war strategy, and in the philosophers' works passages inculcating deceitful stratagems. Although this prince was a cherished relative of the Han, yet the Emperor was unwilling to give him books on war. Now these western barbarians are plunderers and enemies of the state, and far less ought they to be given the classics and statutes. Moreover, your servant has heard that the T'ufan are naturally endowed with energy and perseverance, that they are intelligent and sharp, and untiring in their love for study. By reading these books they will certainly acquire a knowledge of war. When versed in the Odes they will know the use of armies of defence; by study of the Rites they will know the times of disbanding and enlisting troops; the Records will teach them that in war there are measures of deceit and treachery; while by the Essays they will learn about letters of reprimand in mutual intercourse. What is the advantage of giving weapons to plunderers, and of bestowing provisions on robbers? Your servant has heard that when Lu had the Rites of Chou, Ch'i did not take up arms against them, and that when Wu had learnt the use of chariots in war, Ch'u was utterly defeated; the one from its keeping the statutes was an honoured state, the other from giving up an art lost its territory: these may be instanced as models. Moreover, the princess, after having\nbeen given in marriage, and followed her husband far away to a foreign country, ought to follow the barbarian ceremonial. She asks on the contrary for valuable books, and it is the idea of your stupid servant that this is not the request of the princess herself, but suggested by some refugee who has fled to the north and is living among them. Should your Majesty think that it would lead to a loss of good relations with the Fan to break the faith already pledged, then there is no resource; but I beg that the Ch'unch'iu be excluded, when the virtue of the Chou was weak and the vassal princes waxed strong, when each one adopted rites and music, and fought against the other. From this cause falsehood prevailed and deceitful measures originated, so that there are instances of subjects giving orders to the sovereign, and individuals arrogating to themselves the command of the princes. If this book be given, the state will be endangered. The Records say that Y\u00fchsi asked for the Ch'uhusan and P'anying, whereupon Confucius said: 'Better give many cities, for these are celebrated things, and must not be ceded to any one.' The barbarians are covetous and rapacious, value property and disregard territory, and they can be presented with silks and abundance of jade and money, but why need one obey their behest and increase their knowledge? Your servant is the unworthy occupant of a post whose duties are the care of important records, and is deeply pained that the classics should be thrown away on barbarians. Under pain of death he presents this memorial for the careful consideration of your Majesty.\" The memorial was disregarded.\n\nIn the 21st year (733), a decree sent the President of the Board of Works, Li Sung, on a friendly mission to T'ufan. Whenever the T'ang envoys entered their borders, there were marshalled on the spot several lines of mailed warriors and mounted soldiers, to show the power of their arms.\n\nIn the 22nd year (734) the general Li Ch'uan was sent to erect a stone monument at Ch'ihling, to mark the T'ufan frontier line.\n\nThe T'ufan sent a mission of thanks, and said: \"The T'ang and T'ufan are both great nations, and have now determined to make a treaty of lasting peace. Fearing lest the frontier officers should be disorderly, we propose that messenger\nbe sent from both sides to make them clearly understand this fact.\" The Emperor appointed officers, the T'ufan sent Mangpuchih. A proclamation was distributed to all the cities of Chienan and Hohsi to this effect: \"The two nations are at peace, and there must be no plundering nor oppression.\" They then sent Hsinophai, who brought tribute, as well as valuable presents for distribution among the high officers.\n\nIn the 24th year (736), in the first month, the T'ufan sent a mission with tribute of the productions of their country, including several hundred gold and silver vessels and precious ornaments, all of wonderful and strange form and make. The Emperor ordered them to be exhibited outside one of the palace gates for the inspection of the officers. The same year the T'ufan attacked on the west Pulu (Balti), which sent envoys to the Emperor with the news of their peril. The Emperor sent a despatch to the T'ufan to order them to put down their arms, but the T'ufan paid no attention to the command. They then attacked and conquered the Pulu state, and the Emperor was very angry.\n\nAt this time Ts'ui Hsiyi was governor-general of Hohsi. When Liangchou was garrisoned with troops, the T'ufan made a palisade of trees on the Chinese frontier, and stationed guards along it. Hsiyi said to the T'ufan general Ch'ilihsiu: \"The two nations are at peace, what necessity is there for guards, preventing the men cultivating the soil? I propose that all be disbanded, for us to be united as one family. Is not this good policy?\" Ch'ilihsiu replied: \"The governor is honourable and sincere, and his word is to be trusted, but I fear that his government is not so entirely to be relied on, and if one out of ten thousand be hostile and catch us unprepared, we shall repent to no purpose.\" Hsiyi strongly urged his proposition, and sent soldiers, who made a sworn covenant with Ch'ilihsiu and his people, sacrificing white dogs. Both then removed their guards, and the T'ufan herds were sent out to pasture throughout the country. Soon after Hsiyi sent Sun Hui to court to report the affair. Hui, wishing to gain praise for himself, memorialized: \"The T'ufan are unprepared, and if we send troops to surprise them we shall be victorious.\" The Emperor sent Chao Huitsung to return with all speed with Sun Hui to see what was best to do.\nWhen Huitsung and his party arrived at Liangchou, they forged a decree, ordering Hsiyi to attack them by surprise. Hsiyi had no course but to obey. He inflicted a great defeat on the T'ufan on the banks of the Ch'inghai, killing and capturing large numbers. Chi'lihs\u00fc saved his life by flight. Huitsung and Sun Hui were both rewarded with valuable presents. The T'ufan, on account of this, again stopped sending tribute. Hsiyi, on account of this breach of faith, was discontented with the war, and was unsuccessful, and he was soon after transferred to be governor of Honan. Having arrived at the capital, he and Chao Huitsung both saw the spectre of a white dog, and died one after the other. Sun Hui was punished by execution. A decree appointed the governor of Ch'ichou, Hsiao Lin, to take command at Liangchou, and to be governor-general of Hohsi in place of Hsiyi; the governor of Sanchou, Tu Hsiwang, to be governor-general of Lungyu; the governor of Yichou, Wang Hao, to be governor-general of Chiennan; all three to go by separate roads to attack the T'ufan. The destruction of the boundary monument was also ordered.\n\nIn the 26th year (738), the 4th month, Tu Hsiwang led an army to besiege the T'ufan new city, and took it, and established there the Weiwich\u00fcn, sending 1000 soldiers to garrison it. In the 7th month, he again despatched troops from Shanchou, which captured the T'ufan bridge, and the city of Yench'uan to the left (east) of the (Yellow) river. The T'ufan sent 30,000 warriors to fight with the imperial troops, which Heiwang attacked and routed. He then established at the city the Ch\u00eanhisich\u00fcn. Meanwhile, Wang Hao also led the Chiennan soldiers and militia to besiege Anjungeh'eng(40). He first built two walled cities to the right and left of Anjung, as places of attack and defence, while he encamped troops beneath the P'\u00eangp'oling, and gathered all the stores and provisions of the province for their use. In the 9th month, the T'ufan brought all their strength to the relief of the city. The imperial army was totally defeated, and the two new cities both lost to the enemy. Hao barely escaped with his life, while tens of\nthousands of officers and soldiers, as well as the army stores, provisions, and weapons, were all captured by the enemy. Hao was punished by being degraded to be governor of K'uocho. When he first began the war, he squandered on his son money and silks by the myriad, and without authority gave him purple robes, etc., on which were expended several myriads, for which he was degraded to a still lower post in Tuanchou, where he died.\n\nIn the 27th year (739), the 7th month, the T'ufan again attacked the garrisons of Pait'sao and Anjen, and a decree ordered troops to be sent from the garrisons of Lint'ao and Sofang to their succour. The T'ufan had encamped troops on the road, so as to block the road from Lint'ao, which were attacked and driven away.\n\nAfter the defeat of Wang Hao, the governor of Huachou, Chang Yu, was appointed governor of Yichou, and commander-in-chief in Chiennan, with Changch'in Chiench'iuung as deputy. Yu was a civilian, and ignorant of war, so that Chiench'iuung took sole command of the army. The latter soon memorialized to recommend strongly the siege and capture of Anjung. The Emperor was delighted, removed Chang Yu to a post in the capital, and promoted Chiench'iuung to be governor-general of the province. He also personally drew plans for the capture of the city.\n\nIn the spring of the 28th year (740), Chiench'iuung entered into secret relations with Tsaitchu and other T'ufans within the city, who induced the citizens to return to their allegiance, and to admit the imperial troops into the city. He slew all the T'ufan generals and warriors, and sent troops to garrison it. The Emperor, when he heard the news, was much pleased. The high officers memorialized: \"In our humble opinion, this city of the T'ufan, being placed in a commanding situation, they have trusted in its strength, and been able to steal into our borders, which for years they have harassed like a nest of ants, so that even with armies of millions we have gained no success. Your majesty himself devised a secret plan, and, without recourse to arms, sent Li Ss\u00fcching to proclaim it to the Ch'iang tribes, and all were\ngrateful for your favour, so that they changed their designs, and only plotted to prey on each other. Your divine policy is unfathomable, your wise measures incomprehensible. For years they had braved punishment, and now have been swept away in a single day. Your servants again memorialize to-day that your Majesty may simply say: 'Look at the barbarians of the four quarters, in a short time they will be one by one uprooted and destroyed.' The virtuous words once vouchsafed, there is immediately reported a victory over the barbarians, so that your Majesty is seen to be equal to heaven in holiness; the answer comes as quickly as the sound of a musical stone when struck; from ancient times to the present its like has not been seen. We pray you to proclaim it to all the officers, so that it may be recorded in the annals.\" The imperial pencil replied: \"Into this city, in the period Yifeng (676-678), the Ch'iang led the T'ufan, who garrisoned it strongly. Yearly and monthly for a long time, it had been constantly besieged, but the situation is so impregnable that all our efforts were fruitless, and the court all decided that it was not to be conquered. But we, relying on the ignorance of the small Fan, resolved to carry through the affair, and devised a skilful plan by which it has been completed. We have gained the heart of these barbarians, and recovered our fortified city, so that really there is ample cause for rejoicing.\"\n\nIn the 10th month of the same year the T'ufan led another army to assault the city of Anjung,\n\nThe water springs were exhausted, when the rocks opened and springs gushed out. The brigands frightened retreated.\n\nas well as Weichou. Changch'iu Chiench'\u00fcng sent one of his generals at the head of an army against them, and also despatched valiant horsemen from Kuanhung to the succour. The weather was extremely cold, and the rebels after a long time drew off their troops and retreated of their own accord. A decree was issued to change the name of the city to P'ingjung.\n\nIn the spring of the 29th year (741) the Princess of Chinch'\u00eang died, and a mission from T'ufan came to bring\nthe news of her death. They also asked for peace, which the Emperor refused. It was not till some months after the arrival of the missions that the mourning ceremonies for the princess were performed outside one of the palace gates, the court being closed for three days.\n\nIn the 6th month a T'ufan army of 400,000 men assaulted the fortified town of Ch'\u00eang-feng, advanced to the Ch'angning bridge on the west of the garrison of Hoyuan and to the peak of Hunyai in Anjen. The cavalry general, Tsang Hsiyeh, with an army of 5,000, attacked and defeated them. In the 12th month the Tufan again invaded the city of Shihp'u, which the governor-general failed to defend, and the Emperor Yuantsung was still more angry.\n\nIn the beginning of the period T'ienpao, Huangfu Weiming and Wang Chungss\u00fbi were appointed governors-general of Lungyu, but both were unable to conquer.\n\nIn the 1st year of T'ienpao (742), the governor-general of Lungyu, Huangfu Weiming, destroyed the enemy's garrison of Taling, fought at Ch'inghai and defeated Mangpuheh, cutting off 30,000 heads. The next year he destroyed the city of Hungchi, and fought at Shihp'u, where he was unsuccessful, his lieutenant-general being killed. The following year he defeated the enemy, and sent captives to the capital.\n\nIn the 7th year (748) Koshu Han was appointed governor-general of Lungyu. He attacked and recovered the city of Shihp'u, the name of which was changed to Sh\u00eanwuch\u00fcn, and captured their minister of state, Wulunyenkuo.\n\nIn the 10th year (751) the governor-general of Anhs\u00fc, Kao Hsienchih, captured a great chief, and sent him to the Emperor. At this time the Tufan and the Man chief, Kolot\u00eang(41), with united forces attacked Lunan. The governor-general of Chienman, Yang Kuoehung, sent a traitorous and false despatch, saying that he had defeated a Man army of 60,000 men at Yunnan, and recovered three ancient cities, including Hungzhou, at the same time presenting captives. Koshu Han took the cities of Hungzhi and Tamom\u00ean, and recovered all the ancient territory of Chinch'\u00fb, which he divided into ch\u00fcn and hsien, finishing in the 12th year of T'ienpao (753), when he had established Sh\u00eanwuch\u00fcn on the west of Lint'ao, Jaochoch\u00fcn on the west of Chishih, and Wanhisuch\u00fcn to complete Hoch\u00fb.\n\nIn the 14th year (755), Hsinlo, the son of the ruler of the Sup'i(42), a Ch'iang people, submitted, and was appointed Prince of Huaiyi, and given the imperial surname of Li.\n\nIn the 14th year (755), the tsanp'u Ch'ilisulungliehtsan died. The ministers of state appointed his son, Sohsilung-\nliehtsan, sovereign, with the same title of tsanp'u. They sent a mission to renew friendship. Yuantsung despatched the lieutenant-governor of the capital, Ts'ui Kuangyuan, with special credentials, and an imperial letter of appointment, to condole and sacrifice. When he returned, the rebel, An Lushan, had surreptitiously taken possession of Loyang, and Koshu Han was ordered to encamp with all the troops and militia of Ho and Lung at the T'ungkuan pass.\n\nIn ancient times the Ch'in (B.C. 221-201), to the west of the Lungshan (43), founded the Lunghsich\u00fcn. The Han, to keep in check the Hsiungnu, established to the right (west) of the (Yellow) river, the ch\u00fcn of Kutsang, Changyeh, Chiuch'uan, and Yiwu, stationed beyond the desert (of Gobi) a governor-general with rule over the western people, and divided Lunghsi into the ch\u00fcn of Chinch'eng and Hsip'ing, which were occupied jointly by Ti and Ch'iang tribes. During the troubles at the close of each dynasty, if these countries were not held by strong rulers, they were lost to the barbarians, and so on for some thousand years. In the beginning of the period Wut\u00ea (618-626), Hsieh Jenkao acquired the territory of Lungshang as far as the river, and after the capture of Li Kuei possessed all the country of Liangchou stretching to beyond the desert. In the period Ch\u00eankuan (627-649), Li Ching defeated the T'ukuhun, Hou Ch\u00fcnchi subdued Kaoch'ang, and Ashihna Sh\u00ea'rh opened up the western countries, and founded the four ch\u00ean, and all that the sovereigns of old could not subdue became subjects of the empire, so that the territories of the Ch'in and Han were not equal to those of our dynasty. Thereupon, annual levies were made on the able-bodied men to the east of the mountains to be sent on garrison duty, and the silk was all converted into army stores. Military colonies were established to provide grain, and government herds to supply sheep and horses. Large garrisons of 10,000, and small garrisons of 1,000 men, guarded the watch-towers, and patrolled in a line of 10,000 li to keep away the hostile Ch'iang. A governor-general of Lungyu was stationed at Shanchou, a governor-general of Hohsi at Liangchou, and a governor-general of\nAnhsi at Peit'ing, while in Kuannui the governor-general of Sofang was stationed at Lingehou, and there was also at Shouhsiangch'eng a viceroy established to defend it against the Fan.\n\nWhen the T'ungkuan was lost, and Ho and Lo cut off by troops, all the soldiers stationed in Ho, Lung, and Sofang, were recalled to settle the difficulties of the state, to accompany the Emperor in his flight. Thus, at this time, all the old camps and border cities were left ungarrisoned, and from the period Chienyuan (758-759), the T'ufan, taking advantage of our difficulties, daily encroached on the borders, and the citizens were either carried off and massacred or wandered about to die in ditches, till, after the lapse of some years, all the country to the west of F\u00eanghsiang and to the north of Pinchou belonged to the Fan barbarians, and several tens of chou were lost.\n\nIn the 1st year of the reign of Sutsung (756), in the first month, on the cyclical day chia chi'en, a T'ufan mission arrived at court to ask for peace. The Emperor ordered the ministers of state, Kuo Tz\u00fcyi(44), Hsiao Hua, and P'ei Tsanch'ing, to entertain them at a banquet, and to proceed to the Kuangts\u00eass\u00fb, to conclude a sworn treaty, sacrificing the three victims, and smearing the lips with the blood(45). It has never been customary to conduct affairs in a Buddhist temple, and we propose on the morrow to be allowed to go to the Hunghuss\u00fb(46), to smear blood in accordance with the rites of the Fan barbarians. This was allowed.\n\nIn the 1st year of Paoying (762), the 6th month, the T'ufan sent two envoys, Chufan and Mang'rh, with tribute of the products of their country, to the Emperor. He received them in one of the palaces, and rewarded each according to his rank with presents. The western mountains of Chienman, which bordered on the T'ufan Ti Chi'iang, had been from the period Wut\u00ea (618-627) divided into chou and hsien, and garrisoned. It is the Tsolu of the Han dynasty. From the epoch Chienyuan this also was lost to the T'ufan.\n\nIn the 2nd year of Paoying (763), the 3rd month, the Emperor despatched two officers, Li Chihfang and Ts'ui Lun,\non a mission to T'ufan, but as soon as they reached the frontier they were detained.\n\nIn the 1st year of Kuangt\u00ea (763), the 9th month, the T'ufan attacked and took Chingchou, the governor of which, Kao Hui, surrendered to them. In the 10th month they invaded Pinchou, and took Fengt'ienhuen. Kuo Tz\u00fcyi was sent to the west to oppose the T'ufan, but an army of over 200,000 T'ukuhun and Tanghsiang had penetrated from Lungkuang to the east, and Kuo Tz\u00fcyi led back his troops. The imperial chariot was driven to Shangchou and the capital left unguarded. The traitor general, Kao Hui, led the T'ufan into the imperial capital, and in concert with the T'ufan generalissimo, Machungying, set up the son of the late Prince of Pin, Ch'enghung, the Prince of Kuangwu, as Emperor, who chose Tash\u00ea as the title of his reign, and appointed the various officers of state.\n\nKuo Tz\u00fcyi led his troops southwards to defend Shangchou. The T'ufan, after occupying the city fifteen days, retired, and the imperial army recovered the capital, Kuo Tz\u00fcyi being appointed governor. When the Emperor first went to the east the officers with their families all fled southwards to Ching and Hsiang, or went into the mountains to hide, and the soldiers of the imperial armies broke up into armed bands infesting and blocking all the country. Kuo Tz\u00fcyi, at the head of some hundreds of his immediate followers, with his wives, children, and slaves, went south into the Niuhsinku, taking some hundreds of camels, horses, carts, and oxen. Tz\u00fcyi remained there, not knowing which way to turn, till the officers, Wang Yench'ang and Li E, came, and said to him: \"Your Excellency occupies the post of commander-in-chief. The sovereign is toiling outside in the dust, the affairs of the state have come to such a pass, and the power of the T'ufan is daily increasing, and you ought not to be seeking rest in the mountains. Why not go south to Shangchou, and gradually make your way to the imperial camp?\" Tz\u00fcyi immediately consented. Yench'ang added: \"Should the T'ufan find out that your Excellency has gone south, they will detach soldiers to cut you off, so that to go\nby the main road would court disaster, and you had better select the Y\u00fcshan road to travel by, as they would never guess it.\u201d Tz\u00fcyi again agreed. The two officers both accompanied him. His body of some thousand men, on account of the narrowness of the mountain road, stretched in a line of a hundred li, and made such slow progress that the other two, fearing pursuit in a narrow path where the van could not help the rear, went to Taohuik\u2019ou by a different way. They crossed difficult torrents, climbed mountain passes, and finally reached Shangchou.\n\nBefore their arrival the general of the six armies, Chang Chihch\u2019ieh, with some hundreds of his own standard, had fled from the city to Shangchou, and they had plundered the officers of the court and scholars, who were trying to escape, as well as robbed the inhabitants of money, property, saddles, and horses; and this had been going on for days. They remonstrated with the general, saying: \u201cYou have the post of general of the imperial army, yet when your troops were defeated, you did not march to the imperial residence, but allowed your subordinates to plunder. Is this the part of a loyal subject? Now that his Excellency Kuo, the commander-in-chief, is trying to reach Lonan, let the general restore the discipline of his soldiers and promise them punishment or reward, and beg his Excellency to take command, to plan the recovery of Ch\u2019angan. This would redound to the fame of the general.\u201d Chihch\u2019ieh gladly consented. The other generals hastened to place themselves under the orders of Kuo Tz\u00fcyi, as soon as he reached Shangchou.\n\nWhen the T\u2019ufan were about to enter the capital, a former high official, Ying Chungch\u2019ing, escaped the danger, leaving his saddle, horse, and robes in the hands of the robbers. Chungch\u2019ing, when he reached Lant\u2019ien, gathered together scattered troops, and brave recruits, till he had over a hundred followers, and defended Lant\u2019ien on the south against the T\u2019ufan. His army gradually increased till it mounted up to over a thousand. When Tz\u00fcyi reached Shangchou, he knew nothing of this affair of Chungch\u2019ing.\nHe enlisted men to enquire into the strength of the rebels. The general, Changsun Ch'\u00fcanhs\u00fc, volunteered, and was sent with a company of 200 horsemen; Ti Wuch'i was appointed governor of the capital to assist in the recovery of Ch'angan. As soon as Ch'\u00fcanhs\u00fc reached Hankungtui, in the daytime he beat drums, and spread abroad flags and banners, and in the night lit many fires, to deceive the T'ufan. When he heard of the existence of the imperial troops, his energies were redoubled, and they opened up mutual communication, and sent to inform Tz\u00fcyi of their strength. Chungch'ing, with over 200 horsemen, made a detour and crossed the Ch'anshui. The T'ufan, alarmed, questioned the people, who, in order to deceive them, replied: \"His Excellency Kuo is leading an army from Shangchou, with the project of retaking Ch'angan, a large army the number of which we know not.\" The rebels, believing in the truth of this, withdrew their army and retired, a remnant being left in the city. The general Wang Fu led his troops from the hunting-park into the city with drums beating and loud shouts, and Chungch'ing's force also entered. The T'ufan all fled away, and the imperial capital was recovered. Kuo Tz\u00fcyi took advantage of the opportunity, and entered Ch'angan with beat of drum, so that men's minds were at rest.\n\nThe T'ufan retreated to F\u00eanghsiang, where the governor-general shut the gates against them. They besieged it for some days, till the governor-general of Ch\u00eanhsi, Ma Lin, led over 1000 valiant horsemen from Hohsi to relieve Yang Chihlieh, and conducted his troops into the city. On the morrow at dawn he rode fully armed straight into the midst of the rebel army, supported on either side by some hundred of his horsemen. Lin fought desperately, with loud shouts, and the enemy fell down, unable to withstand him; they were defeated, and retired. On the next day the rebel army, boasting of the valour of their braves, came up again to the walls to provoke a battle. Lin put on his armour and let down the hanging gate, whereupon they drew back, and all retreated, saying: \"This general has no fear of death, there\nis no resisting him, let us withdraw.\" They returned to their quarters in the lands of Yuan, Hui, Ch'\u00eang, and Wei.\n\nIn the 12th month the Emperor returned to his capital.\n\nThis year they invaded on the south Sungchou, Weichou, and Paochou, and the city of Hsinghung in Yunshan.\n\nIn the 2nd year (763), the 5th month, they released Li Chihfang, who returned. In the 9th month, the traitor general, P'uku Huai\u00ean(47), Prince of Tuning, despatched from Lingwu his confederates, Fan Chich\u00eang and J\u00ean Fu, to lead the armies of the T'ufan and T'ukuhun to attack the imperial residence. In the 10th month, Huai\u00ean's army reached Pinchou and offered battle. The governor-general, Pai Hsiaot\u00ea, defended the city against them, and blunted the edge of their power. The rebel army next approached F\u00eangt'ienhsien, and encamped twenty li to the west of the city. Kuo Tz\u00fcyi was encamped at F\u00eangt'ien, but kept his army in garrison, and would not fight. A general from thirty li to the west of Pinchou despatched 250 swift horsemen and 50 foot-soldiers to destroy the camp of Huai\u00ean; they defeated an army of 5000, cut off several thousand heads and took 85 prisoners, including four chief generals, as well as 500 horses. In the 11th month, Huai\u00ean led the T'ufan army back.\n\nIn the 2nd year of Kuangt\u00ea (764), the governor-general of Hohsi, Yang Chihlieh, was besieged in Liangchou, and defended the city several years, but it was isolated with no help; he escaped alive, and fled westwards to Kanohou, and Liangchou was also lost to the enemy.\n\nIn the 1st year of Yungt'ai (765), the 3rd month, the T'ufan asked for peace. The ministers of state, Yuan Tsai and Tu Hungchien, were sent to the Hsingt'angss\u00fbi, to make a sworn covenant with them, and the ceremony was performed.\n\nIn the autumn, the 9th month, P'uku Huai\u00ean enticed the T'ufan and Huiho to attack on the south the imperial residence. The T'ufan generals, Shangchiehhsitsamno, Shanghsitungtsan, Shangyehhsi, and Machungying, at the head of an army of 200,000 men, came to the borders of F\u00eangt'ien. The governor-general of Pinchou was unable to withstand\nthem, and the capital was strictly guarded. The generals of Sofang had previously encamped their troops at F\u00eangt\u2019ien to resist them. A decree recalled the assistant commander-in-chief, Kuo Tz\u00fcyi, from Hochungfu, to lead his forces with all speed to the rescue, and he encamped at Chingyang. The other generals all encamped their troops to garrison vital positions.\n\nWhen the T\u2019ufan first pitched their tents at F\u00eangt\u2019ien the general Hun Jihchin rode alone into their midst, followed closely by 200 valiant horsemen, and surprised their camp, shooting and spearing right and left till the rebels fled in alarm, and none escaped the point of the arrow. Jihchin seized a Fan general, and galloped back with him. During the struggles of this general he lost his quiver, but not one of his men was wounded by spear or arrow. When the army saw this, their bravery was redoubled.\n\nOn the morrow the whole T\u2019ufan force besieged him. Jihchin ordered stones to be projected from the carriage-engines, and made ready the bows and crossbows, killing and wounding heaps of the enemy, and after some days they collected their troops and returned to camp. Soon after Jihchin attacked the rebel camp in the night below Liang-mush\u00ean, and killed over a thousand, captured 500 prisoners, with camels, horses, stores, and weapons. He sent to the Emperor an open despatch with the news of his victory. He then encamped at Maweitien in F\u00eangt\u2019ien, and between the 19th and 25th day of the same month fought more than two hundred engagements, in which he defeated 100,000 of the T\u2019ufan, cut off 5,000 heads, and took 160 prisoners, 1,242 horses, 115 camels, with stores, weapons, umbrellas, in all some 30,000 articles.\n\nThe Emperor next decided himself to take command, requisitioned the horses of the court officials, and established recruiting stations in the capital. The capital was in great alarm, and the citizens all deserted their houses, the large gates being pierced with holes for exit. The court officials also trembled with fear, and eight or nine tenths of their families went into hiding, in spite of prohibitory decrees.\nThe governor-general, Ma Lin, fell in with some 400 T'ufan scouts riding over the eastern plains of Wukung, and despatched a body of 50 against them, who killed them all without leaving one alive.\n\nRain fell on the 17th day, and did not stop till the evening of the 25th; it was considered to be aid from heaven. The T'ufan moved their camp to Lich'uanhsien, north of the Chiutsungshan, attacking and plundering Lich'uan. They then retreated to the north of Yungshou, where they met the army of the Huiho, and returned to plunder F\u00eangt'ien. The T'ufan again came to Maweitien, where they burnt the dwellings of the inhabitants and then retreated. The traitor Jen Fu, with over 5000 men, attacked Paishuihsien, and sacked T'unghchou.\n\nFrom the year before, when the T'ufan attacked the imperial residence, and afterwards, when their troops were encamped at the Chungweich'iao and Shuf\u00eangch'eng, till now, their attacks continued. As soon as they heard of the death of Huai\u00ean, his troops rebelled, quarrelled among themselves, and fled. The two nations, suspicious and divided, disputed for supremacy, and camped in separate places. The Huiho were angry, and the T'ufan roamed to Yaoti. Three thousand mounted Huiho came to Chingyang to give in their allegiance, and offered to aid in an attack on the T'ufan; and Kuo Tz\u00fcyi accepted their offer. Thereupon the Prince Pai Yuankuang united his forces with the Huiho, and in Chingyang, fifty li east of Lingt'aishien, they attacked and defeated the T'ufan, killing and taking prisoners, and capturing camels, horses, oxen and sheep in large numbers. P'uku Mingch'en surrendered. The Emperor gave up the project of a personal expedition, the capital was released from its state of siege, and the ministers and officials presented memorials of congratulation.\n\nIn the 2nd year of Yung't'ai (766), the 2nd month, the Emperor appointed Yang Chi to conclude a new peace with the T'ufan. In the 4th month the T'ufan sent the chief Lunhsitsang, accompanied by over a hundred men, to go with Chi to court and offer thanks for the renewal of good relations.\nIn the 2nd year of Tali (767) they invaded Lingchou, where, in the 10th month, 20,000 T'ufan were defeated, 500 made prisoners, and 1500 horses taken. In the 11th month the envoy Hsieh Chingsien returned from a mission to T'ufan, and the chief Lunhsiling accompanied him to court. Chinghsien memorialized that the tsanp'u asked for F\u00eang-linkuan to be made the boundary. Shortly after they sent another envoy, Luhsai, with fifteen men, to court.\n\nIn the 3rd year (768), the 8th month, 100,000 Tu'fan invaded Lingwu, and their great general Shangtsanmo invaded Pinchou.\n\nBefore this time Shanghsichieh, from the period Paoying, had several times invaded the borders, and when, having acquired great fame, he retired from old age, he was replaced by Shangtsunmo as governor-general of the east, with rule over the provinces of Ho and Lung.\n\nThe governor-general of Pinning, Ma Lin, defeated an army of over 20,000, and presented the prisoners taken to the Emperor. In the 9th month they invaded Lingchou, where the Sofang cavalry general, Pai Yuankuang, defeated them, and soon after again defeated them, capturing several thousand sheep and horses. The Kuannui assistant commander-in-chief, Kuo Tz\u00fcyi, defeated an army of 60,000 T'ufan in Lingwu. In the 12th month, on account of the Fan invasions and yearly plunder of the western borders, the garrisons were reinforced, and Ma Lin was moved to defend Chingchou with the appointment of governor-general of Chingyuan. In Chiennan, at Hsich'uan, there was another defeat of 10,000 T'ufan.\n\nIn the 5th year (770), the 5th month, the five chou An, Hsi, T'o, Ching, and Kung, were moved to vital positions in the mountains to resist the T'ufan.\n\nIn the autumn of the 8th year (773) 60,000 T'ufan horsemen invaded Lingwu, trampled down our corn and retired. In the 10th month they invaded Chingchou and Pinchou. Kuo Tz\u00fcyi sent the general of the van, Hun Hsien, who engaged the rebels at Yilu, but our army was unsuccessful, Shih Chi was killed, with two other lieutenant-generals, and more than a thousand of the inhabitants of the country were driven off. The same night Hun Hsien, having collected\ntogether the scattered soldiers, invaded the enemy's camp, while Ma Lin at the same time fell upon the baggage-train, slaughtering several thousands, and the rebels were dispersed. Kuo Tz\u00fcyi totally defeated a T'ufan army of 100,000 men.\n\nWhen the T'ufan first attacked our Pinchou territory, Ma Lin, with some 2,000 valiant warriors, made a secret night foray on the rebel camp, and shot a rebel leopard-skin general in the eye; the rebels supporting him broke out into loud cries of lamentation, and the whole camp was evacuated. Ma Lin thereby recovered over 200 of the brave troops of Sofang, and 700 of the common people, as well as several hundreds of camels and horses.\n\nIn the 9th year (774), the 4th month, on account of the T'ufan invasions and troubles, the frontier guards were reinforced, and the Emperor issued a decree: \"We hereby command Tz\u00fcyi with 50,000 foot and horse of Shangshun, Peiti, Satsuai, Wuyuan, Yichiu, Chihu, and Hsienpi, to take up a strong position in Hs\u00fcnyi, and reinforce the old troops: Paoy\u00fc with 30,000 men from Kaotu in Chin and Shangtang in Han, the loyal natives of Hohuang, and the young men of Ch'ienlung, to form a line on the high ground, in a continuous series of camps: Ma Lin, with 30,000 men of Hsiy\u00fc Ch'ienting and Ch\u00fcshih Houpu, with the warriors of Kuangwu and the levies of Hsiachi, to encamp at Yuanchhou, a strong reserve for the great army: Chungch'eng, with 20,000 men of the trained bands of Wulo, and the brave army of Yuti, to go from Ch'iyang to the north: and Hsijang, with the trained bands of the capital, and the sons of the brave men of the imperial armies, to go from Weishang to the west. Let a united army of 40,000 men from Pien, Sung, Tz\u00fc, Ch'ing, Ho, Yang, Yu, and Chi, be divided and marshalled in the front and rear, and 60,000 from Wei, Ch'eng, Te, Chao, Yi, and Yung, be massed to the left and right. We will, in our palace, take command of the guards, and ourselves issue orders to the generals. We give thousands of ounces of gold for expenses, and bestow the horses of the imperial stud. For the armour and weapons, army equipment and frontier stores, the officials in charge of\neach will carefully provide everything. We will give to you generals and ministers, officers both civil and military, of ability and energy. The victory of an army depends on union, and good fighters do not wait to be marshalled. Each one must guard his own frontier, camping on and defending the important posts, and the smoke-towers must be lighted, the front and rear answering each other. Should they repent of their misdeeds, there will be no need for troubling the people; but if still contumacious we must ourselves punish them, and they will afterwards ask to surrender to the empire. For the orders of the various armies and plans of invasion and conquest, further commands will be issued.\"\n\nIn the 11th year (776), the 1st month, the governor-general of Chiennan, Ts'ui Ning, inflicted a great defeat on four Tufan governors, with Tuch\u00fceh, Tuhun, Ti, Man, Chiang and Tanghsiang, an allied army of over 200,000 men, cutting off 10,000 heads, taking alive the commander of the forces of Lach'eng and 1,350 prisoners, who were presented at the gate of the palace, and oxen, sheep, war stores, material and weapons more than could be counted.\n\nThe Tufan, having failed in their projects, invaded Li and Ya, whereupon the Chiennan troops, in union with the Nanchao, fought with and defeated them, capturing the great 'lung' officer Lunch'ijan.\n\nIn the 12th year (777), the 9th month, they invaded Fangchou, plundered the Tanghsiang sheep and horses and retired. In the 11th month Ts'ui Ning took the Tufan Wanghan city.\n\nThe governor-general of Shannan Hsiao, Chang Hsienkung, fought a battle at Minchou, where the Tufan fled. Ts'ui Ning defeated the Sanlu of the Western Hills and the soldiers of Ch'ungnian, and cut off 8,000 heads.\n\nIn the 13th year (778), the enemy's great chief, Machungying, with 40,000 horsemen, invaded the Lingchou barrier. The officer in charge of the military colonies was dismissed on account of his mismanagement. Machungying ravaged Yen and Ch'ing and withdrew.\n\nIn the 14th year (779), the 8th month, the Emperor appointed Wei Lun, with special credentials, envoy to Tufan, to take with him 500 Fan captives back to their country.\n\nIn the 10th month the Tufan, at the head of an army of 200,000 of the Southern Man, invaded in three bodies, one into Maochou, across the Wench'uan and the Kuank'ou,\nanother into Fuwen past Fangwei and Paipa, a third from Li and Yu through the Chiunglai pass, destroying a number of cities in succession. Four thousand imperial troops and five thousand men from Yuchou were despatched, who attacked them together and greatly defeated them.\n\nIn the 1st year of Chienchung (780), the 4th month, Wei Lun reached his destination. During the latter part of the Tali period several of their missions of inquiry had been successively detained, and not sent back. When captives were taken, eunuchs were always sent in charge of them to take them to Chiangling, and they demanded money from them in addition to the expenses of their maintenance, so that they were distressed beyond measure. Last year, in the winter, when the Tufan levied a great army and invaded the empire by three roads, Tettsung had but just succeeded to the throne. He determined to rule the four quarters with virtue, and collected five hundred of the chained captives, gave to each a suit of clothes, and sent Wei Lun to take them back to their country, and to conclude a treaty of peace, and also commanded the frontier generals to put a stop to plunder and invasion.\n\nWhen the Tufan first heard of the return of these men, they were incredulous, but as soon as the Fan captives entered their borders the people were all awed with the power, and grateful for the grace of the Emperor. The tsanp'a, Ch'ilitsan, addressing Wei Lun, said:\n\nThe surname of Ch'ilitsan was Hulufi.\n\n\"I did not know of your coming, and I have three causes of sorrow. What am I to do?\" Wei Lun replied: \"I do not understand what you refer to.\" Ch'ilitsan said: \"I was ignorant of the loss the empire had sustained, and was unable to console and mourn\u2014this is the first. I knew not the day of the imperial funeral, and was unable to present offerings, and fulfil the proper rites\u2014this is the second. I knew not of the holy and wise accession of the Emperor, my father-in-law, and despatched armies by three parallel roads. The army of Lingwu, having already heard of your appointment, has halted. But the army of Shannan has invaded Fuwen, and\nthe army of Shu marched past Kuank\u2019ou, and they have not yet been overtaken\u2014this is my third sorrow.\u201d He then sent envoys with despatches and presents to the Emperor, and in less than twenty days they returned with the imperial commands.\n\nThe commander-in-chief in Shu sent to the Emperor the captives which he had taken in battle, and the officers petitioned that they should be treated in accordance with the old practice, and sent to be slaves, but the sovereign replied: \u201cOur wish for a treaty is on record, and can our words be double?\u201d He therefore bestowed on each two pieces of silk, and a suit of clothes, and sent them back.\n\nIn the 5th month, Wei Lun was promoted, and again sent on a mission to T\u2019ufan. In the winter they sent the chief minister, Lunch\u2019inmingtsai, and suite, fifty-five persons in all, who accompanied Wei Lun on his return, and offered productions of their country. When the T\u2019ufan saw Lun on his second arrival, they were greatly rejoiced, and as soon as he reached his hotel entertained him with a band of music. After detaining him nine days, they sent him back, together with their chief minister, with the answer to the imperial command.\n\nIn the 2nd year (781), the 12th month, the secretary of the mission to T\u2019ufan, Ch\u2019ang Lu, in company with a T\u2019ufan envoy, Lunhsinolo, came back from the Fan country. When Ch\u2019ang Lu, with the envoy Ts\u2019ui Hanh\u00eang, first arrived at their hotel, the Tsanp\u2019u ordered them to stop, and made them first produce the official despatch. That having been done, he sent this message to Hanh\u00eang: \u201cThe imperial despatch you bring says: \u2018The things offered as tribute have all been accepted, and now we bestow on our son-in-law a few presents for him to take when they arrive.\u2019 Our great Fan and the T\u2019ang nations are allied by marriage, and how is it that we are treated with the rites due to a subject? Again, you wish to fix the boundary to the west of Yunchou, but we propose that Holanshan be made the boundary. For the sworn ceremony we propose to follow that of the 2nd year of Chinglung (708), when the imperial despatch said: \u2018When\nthe T'ang envoy arrives there, the son-in-law shall first conclude the sworn ceremony with him; and when the Fan envoy arrives here, we, the father-in-law, will ourselves take part in the ceremony with him.' Let, then, Hanh\u00eang send a messenger to report to the Emperor that he may act.\"\n\nLu was sent back to report, and the imperial despatch was accordingly altered, the words 'offered as tribute' changed to 'presented,' 'bestowed' to 'given,' and 'for him to take' to 'for his acceptance,' the following sentences being added: \"The former minister, Yang Yen, departed from the old practice, and is responsible for these errors. For the fixing of the boundaries, and the sworn ceremony, everything is conceded.\"\n\nIn the 3rd year (782), the 4th month, they released the generals, warriors, and Buddhist monks, who had been carried off to the Fan country, in all 800 persons, and sent them back in return for the delivery of the Fan captives.\n\nIn the 9th month, the envoy appointed to make peace with T'ufan, Ts'ui Hanh\u00eang, accompanied by a Fan envoy, Ch'\u00fcleitsan, arrived. At this time the T'ufan chief minister, Shanghsichieh, who was tyrannical and fond of slaughter, having been overthrown and beaten in Chiennan, was anxious to wipe away his disgrace, and unwilling to make peace. The second minister, Shangchiehtsan, an able and politic man, reported to the tsanp'u to ask him to fix the boundary, and to conclude a treaty, so as to give rest to the inhabitants of the borders. The tsanp'u consented, and appointed Chiehtsan chief minister in place of Hichieh to negotiate the treaty of peace and friendship. The 15th day of the 6th month was fixed for the performance of the ceremony on the border, Ts'ui Hanh\u00eang was appointed president of the court of entertainment; and Fan Ts\u00ea sent as envoy to T'ufan to conclude the negotiations. When Hanh\u00eang first made the agreement with the T'ufan, the day for the performance of the ceremony was fixed; but when Hanh\u00eang arrived, the negotiations were not finished, till the day was passed. Therefore the Emperor ordered Fan Ts\u00ea to go to Chiehtsan to fix another day for the ceremony, and\nalso sent the governor-general of Lungyu, Chang Yi, to take part with them on the occasion. Fan Ts\u00ea went to the old Yuanchou(48), where he had an interview with Shangchiehtsan, and they chose the 15th day of the first month of the coming year for the performance of the ceremony to the west of Ch'ingshui(49).\n\nIn the 1st month of the 4th year (783), the imperial decree was issued that Chang Yi and Shangchiehtsan should make a sworn compact at Ch'ingshui(49). When the time approached, Yi and Chiehtsan agreed that each party should proceed to the place where the altar was raised with 2,000 men, half of them to be armed and drawn up two hundred paces outside the altar, half unarmed attendants to be distributed below the altar. Chang Yi, with the masters of ceremony Ch'iying and Ch'ik'ang, and the treaty officials Ts'ui Hanh\u00eang, Fan Ts\u00ea, Ch'ang Lu and Y\u00fc Yu, seven persons all in court costume; Shangchiehtsan with the generals and ministers of his nation, Lunhsichia-tsang, Lun-tsangj\u00ea, Lunli, T'o\u015fti, Kuanch\u00ea and Lunlhihs\u00fbi, also seven persons; ascended the altar together to perform the sworn ceremony. It had at first been agreed that the Han should sacrifice an ox, the Fan a horse; but Yi, ashamed of his part in the ceremony, wished to depreciate the rites, and said to Chiehtsan: \"The Han cannot cultivate the ground without oxen, the Fan cannot travel without horses, I propose therefore to substitute a sheep, pig and dog as the three victims.\" Chiehtsan consented. But there were no pigs outside the barrier, and Chiehtsan determined to take a wild ram, while Yi took a dog and a sheep. These victims were sacrificed on the north of the altar, the blood mingled in two vessels and smeared on the lips. The sworn covenant was: \"The T'ang possess all under heaven, wherever are the footprints of Y\u00fc, and as far as boats and chariots can go there is no one that does not obey them. Under successive sovereigns their fame has increased, and its years have been prolonged, and the great empire of its sovereigns extended, till all within the four seas listen to its commands. With the Tufan tsanp'u it has made matrimonial alliances to\nstrengthen the bonds of neighbourly friendship and unite the two countries, and the sovereigns have been allied as father and son-in-law for nearly two hundred years. Meanwhile, however, in consequence of minor disagreements, their good relations have been broken off by war, so that the border-land has been troubled and without a quiet year. The Emperor on his recent accession compassionated his black-haired people, and sent back the enslaved captives to their own country, and the Fan nation has exhibited good feeling and agreed to a mutual peace. Envoy have gone and returned, carrying in succession the orders of their sovereign, who has determined to put a stop to secret plotting and put by the chariots of war. They have, with the view of making the covenant of the two countries lasting, proposed to use the ancient sworn treaty, and the government, resolved to give rest to the natives of the border, have alienated their ancient territory, preferring good deeds to profit, and have made a solemn treaty in accordance with the agreement. The boundaries that the government now keep are: on the west of Chingchou the western mouth of the T'ants\u00ean pass, on the west of Lungchou the city Ch'ingshuihsien, and on the west of Fengchou the city T'ungkuhsien; while in the western mountains of Chiennan, the east bank of the Tatu River is the Han boundary. The Fan nation rule over Lan, Wei, Yuan and Hui, reaching on the west to Lin'tao, and on the east as far as Ch'\u00eangchou; and on the western frontier of Chiennan, the land of the Mo, Hsieh, and other Man, the south-west of the Tatu River is the Fan boundary. The places garrisoned by regular troops, the walled cities which are inhabited, and the Man tribes between the two borders subject to the Han, according to the present distribution of their lands, all are to remain as heretofore. On the north of the Yellow River from the ancient Hsinch'unanch\u00fcn, to the north as far as the Taling, to the south as far as the Lot'oling of the Holanshan, shall be border-land, and all be neutral territory. With regard to the places not included in the covenant, wherever the Fan have garrisons the Fan shall keep, wherever the Han have garrisons the Han shall keep,\neach retaining its present possessions, and not seeking to encroach on the other. The places that heretofore have not been garrisoned, shall not have troops stationed in them, nor shall walled cities be built, nor land cultivated. Now the generals and ministers of the two countries having been commissioned to meet, and having fasted and purified themselves in preparation for the ceremony, proclaim to the gods of heaven and earth, of the mountains and rivers, and call the gods to witness that their oath shall not be broken. The text of the covenant shall be preserved in the ancestral temple, and the officers in charge according to the regulations of the two nations shall always keep it.\"\n\nChihtsang also produced a sworn covenant which he did not put into the pit where only the victims were buried.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the sworn ceremony, Chihtsang proposed to Yi to go to the south-west corner of the altar into a Buddhist tent to burn incense and make oath. When this was finished, they again ascended the altar, when they drank wine and both gave and received ceremonial presents, each offering the products of his country, as a mark of liberal friendship. Finally they returned home.\n\nIn the second month, the Emperor appointed Ts'ui Hanheng to go with special credentials on a return mission to the Fan, and sent Ch'uchiahsan back with him. The Emperor had originally ordered the ministers and presidents of the boards to make a sworn covenant with the Fan minister Ch'uchiahsan on the altar at Fengyili; but this covenant, on account of the meeting at Ch'ingshui, was not concluded, and the decree was withdrawn. Consequently Chiatsan was detained, and Hanheng again sent on a mission to the tsamp'u.\n\nIn the 6th month the secretary of the return mission to Fan, Yu Yu, accompanied by the Fan envoy Lunchiamutsang, arrived from Ch'ingshui.\n\nIn the 7th month the President of the Board of Rites, Li K'uei, was appointed envoy to Fan to conclude the sworn covenant. The Emperor also ordered the ministers of state, Li Chungch'en, Lu Ch'i, Kuan Po, and Ts'ui Ning, the pre-\nsident of the Board of Works, Ch\u2019iao Ling, with six other high officials, to make a sworn covenant with Ch\u2019uchiahtsan and his colleagues on the altar. When Y\u00fc Yu first came back from the Fan country he had agreed with Shangchiehtsan that as soon as the boundaries were fixed, they would send back the envoy; which was done. Because the altar at F\u00eangyi was within the walls of the city, it was inconvenient, and it was proposed to fix by divination a propitious site for an altar to the west of the capital. The rites were like those employed at the ceremony at Chi\u2019ingshui. Two days before the ceremony the Emperor ordered the proper officers to announce it in the ancestral temple. The officials who took part in the sworn covenant fasted for three days and ascended the altar in court costume, where Kuan Po on his knees read aloud the covenant. When the ceremony was concluded the Emperor entertained them at a banquet, bestowed presents and sent them back.\n\nIn the 1st year of Hainingyuan (784), the 2nd month, Y\u00fc Chi\u2019i was sent to Chingchou to superintend the T\u2019ufan, and to consult with the governors of the cities as to encamping or leading them on. The T\u2019ufan had come to the barrier to offer troops to help to settle the difficulties of the state; hence the despatch of this envoy. In the 4th month Sh\u00ean Fang was sent to the Fan to devise a plan of campaign and to be superintendent of Anhs\u0131 and Peit\u2019ing. In the same month Hun Hsien and the T\u2019ufan Lunmanglo led an army and greatly defeated the generals of Chu Tz\u00fc(50), Han Ming, Chang T\u2019ingchih and Sung Kueich\u2019aot, at the Wutingch\u2019uan at Wukung, where they cut off over 10,000 heads.\n\nIt was originally agreed with the enemy that after Ch\u2019angan had been conquered, four chou, including Ching and Ling, should be given to them. There was a great pestilence, and in consequence they withdrew their men; yet after the conquest of Chu Tz\u00fc, they asked for the territory in accordance with the old agreement. The Son of Heaven made light of their services, and merely bestowed a decree, rewarding Chiehtsan and Manglo with 10,000 pieces of silk. Thereupon the enemy was dissatisfied.\n\nIn the 2nd year of Ch\u00eannyuan (786), Chao Y\u00fc was sent on a mission to the Fan. In the 8th month the T\u2019ufan invaded the districts of Ching, Lung, Pin, and Ning, carrying off\nmen and hordes, and plundering the crops, so that the borders were in great distress. The governors and the generals closed the gates of the cities and defended themselves, and nothing else. The capital was strictly guarded, and the Emperor despatched generals with troops to encamp at Hsienyang, and ordered the governor-general of Hochung to lead an army to the relief of Hsienyang. In the 9th month, when T'ufan light horsemen had penetrated as far as Haossu, the Emperor sent another army to encamp at Hsienyang, and ordered the general K'ang Ch'eng to be sent as envoy to the T'ufan. The T'ufan chief minister, Shangchietsean, had previously sent a succession of missions to ask for a solemn meeting to fix the boundaries. Thereupon Ch'eng was appointed envoy, and went to Joyuan, when he had an interview with Chiehtsean, who sent Lunchit'o to return with Ch'eng.\n\nIn the same month the governor-general of Fenghsiang, Li Ch'eng, on account of the continued invasion of the T'ufan, sent his general Wang Pi to make a night attack on the enemy's camp, and to lead 3,000 picked braves into Chi'enyang. His final instructions were: \"The main army of the enemy must pass under the city walls. Be careful not to attack the front or rear; for even if the front or rear be defeated, the strength of the centre will be unimpaired, so that they will assault you in force, and you will certainly meet with disaster. Only wait till the front of the army has passed, and you see the five-square banner, and the tiger and leopard robes. This will be the main army; go out and take them by surprise, and you will gain rare fame.\" Wang Pi followed this advice, sallied out and attacked them, and the enemy was totally defeated. Our lieutenant-general was killed fighting bravely. They also invaded Fenghsiang up to the walls of the city, when Li Ch'eng led out his troops against them, and they retired the same night.\n\nIn the 10th month Li Ch'eng sent troops which captured the T'ufan fortified town Tuishap'u, and greatly defeated them, burning the military stores, and slaying Huch'il\u00fc-shetsan and six other Fan chiefs, and sending their heads to the capital.\nIn the 11th month the T'ufan took Yenchou(51). As soon as the enemy reached this city, the governor, Tu Yenkuang sent out oxen and wine to feast them. The T'ufan said to him: \"We want to occupy the city, will you lead your men away?\" Yenkuang, at the head of his troops, fled to Fuchou. In the 12th month they took Hsiachou(52), the governor of the city retiring with his troops, whereupon they took possession. Then they invaded Yinchou, which was an un-walled city, and the inhabitants all scattered and fled.\n\nThe Son of Heaven, on account of the distress and loss of the natives of the borders, decreed to remove from the principal halls of the palace, humbly confessing his faults, and ordered Lo Yuankuang to take measures for the recovery of Yen and Hsia.\n\nIn the spring of the 3rd year (787), Ts'ui Huan was appointed to go on a mission to the T'ufan; and afterwards another envoy, La T'ien, was in turn sent. The governor-general of Hotung and Paoning, Ma Sui, came to have audience. Shangchihtsan, when he took Yenchou and Hsiachou, left in each city a garrison of about 1,000 men, while he encamped with his main army at Mingsha, where he remained from last winter to this spring, during which time many of his sheep and horses died, so that his provisions were exhausted. The Emperor now sent the governor-general of Huachou and T'ungkuan Lo Yuankuang, and the governor-general of Pinning Han Yukuai, with their own troops, and the soldiers of Fenghsiang, Fu, and Pin, and the other districts, to encamp on the frontier, while he ordered Ma Sui to lead his army to wait at Shihchou, and occupy the opposite bank of the river to Lo Yuankuang, so as to attack them between two horns. As soon as Chiehtsan heard of this, he was greatly alarmed, and sent a succession of envoys to ask for peace, and for a renewal of the sworn convention, all of which the Emperor refused. Then he sent his chief general, Lunchiaj\u00e8 with valuable gifts, and humble words, to beg Sui to ask for a treaty. Sui memorialized, but the Emperor again refused, ordering him to attack them with united forces and drive them away. Sui was fond of bribes and easily deceived, and he came to court with Lunchiaj\u00e8, affirming positively that their words were to be trusted, and\nthat a sworn treaty should be granted, and at last the Emperor consented. While Sui was at court the armies remained passively intrenched, while Chiehtsan suddenly evacuated Hsiachou, and retreated, although many of the horses had died, so that the men were on foot. In the summer there was a convention at P'ingliang, but immediately afterwards they broke the treaty. On account of all this, Sui was deprived of his command, and kept out of office.\n\nIn the 4th month, Ts'ui Huan arrived from Mingsha. When he first reached Mingeha, he had an interview with Shangchiehtsan, and asked him why he had broken the treaty by taking Yenchou and Hsiachou. He replied, \"Because of the destruction of the monument fixing the boundary, I feared that the two countries would disregard the convention, and invade each other's territory, therefore I came to the frontier to ask for a renewal of the old friendly relations. Again, the T'ufan troops, which that year defeated the army of Chu Tz\u00fc at Wukung, have not received the reward promised; for this reason also we came. As soon as we reached Chingchou, the governor shut himself up in the city, and would give no answer to our questions. We then marched to Fenghsiang, and tried to communicate with His Excellency Li, but he also would not see us or receive our messengers. Finally Kang Ch'\u00eang and Wang Chen were sent to us, but when they arrived neither had authority to speak for the Empire. I daily looked for the appointment of a great minister as envoy, and was ready to explain my conduct, but none really came. Then I led back my troops. The commanders of the two cities of Yen and Hsia, afraid of our army, offered their cities to us, asking quarter, and fled; we did not attack and take them. Now Your Excellency, a relative of the Emperor, has special powers; and if you will cement friendship by a new-sworn ceremony, the Fan are willing. As regards the day of the meeting, and the place for fixing the boundary, we will obey your commands. When you shall have returned and reported, and it be all settled, we will give up to you Yen and Hsia.\" He also said: \"At the meeting at Ch'ingshui too few took part\nin the ceremony, therefore the peace has been disregarded, and made light of as not complete. Now let Fan ministers, and commander-in-chief, and other officers\u2014in all twenty-one persons\u2014go to Lingchou, the governor-general of which, Tu Hsich'uan, is a lover of peace and virtue, and is well known outside the border; and I propose that he be appointed to preside over the ceremony, while the governor-general of Chingchou, Li Kuan, might officiate as joint president.\u201d They both presented memorials.\n\nThe Emperor was informed by Huan that he had bribed some of the Fan officers to tell him the exact number of their troops, and that they amounted to 59,000 men and over 86,000 horses, including however only 30,000 fighting warriors, the rest mere boys, swelling the number to the full total. The same day he appointed Ts'ui Huan President of the Board of Entertainment, and sent him again to the T'ufan with this reply to Shangchiehtsan: \u201cTu Hsich'uan is on duty at Lingchou, and cannot leave the border, while Li Kuan has been transferred to another post. We have appointed Hun Hsien envoy to conclude a sworn treaty, and have fixed the 24th day of the 5th month to repeat the ceremony at Ch'ingshui.\u201d He also ordered him to say that Yen and H'sia must be returned to us before the ceremony. The Emperor was suspicious of the trustworthiness of the Fan, and made the recovery of these cities a test.\n\nIn the 5th month Hun Hsien, having been appointed envoy to conclude the sworn treaty, had a final audience to receive instructions. The President of the Board of War, Ts'ui Hanh\u00eang, was appointed assistant-envoy, and Ch\u00eang Shuch\u00fc secretary. When Hun Hsien proceeded to the place of meeting, the Sovereign ordered him to take with him an army of 20,000 men, and despatched the governor-general of Huachou and T'ungkuan, Lo Yuankuang, to accompany him. The Emperor ordered the ministers of state to invite the T'ufan envoy, Lunhsitsan, and his colleagues, to consult with the grand council on the place to be fixed for the meeting. Ts'ui Huan and Shangchiehtsan had at first agreed to repeat the sworn ceremony at Ch'ingshui,\nand also that our Yenchou and Hsiaochou should be previously given up, but Chiehtsan afterwards said: \"Ch'ingshui is not an auspicious territory, and I propose that the meeting be held in Yuanchou, at T'ulishu. I also propose after the conclusion of the sworn ceremony to give up the two cities.\" The envoy sent by Huan and Lunhsitsan reported this in a joint memorial. The Emperor, anxious to show clemency to foreigners, granted everything, and fixed the 15th day of the 5th month for the ceremony at T'ulishu.\n\nThe Emperor called the ministers of state to deliberate again, after the general Ma Yulin had reported that the T'ulishu country was full of difficult passes, and that he feared a secret ambush of Tufan troops and consequent disaster to us; whereas P'ingliang was a plain, open on all sides, and besides close to Chingchou(53), and therefore more advantageous. Thereupon they determined that the place for the ceremony should be the valley of P'ingliang. Meanwhile the Fan envoy, Lunhsitsan, had started, but he was pursued and brought back, told of the new decision, and sent away again.\n\nWhen Hun Hsien and Shangchiehtsan met at P'ingliang, they agreed at first to draw up 3,000 men on the east and west side of the altar, while 400 unarmed men came forward below the altar. Just before the ceremony they also agreed each to have mounted scouts to watch the movements of the other. Chiehtsan massed several tens of thousands of picked horsemen on the west of the altar; and the Fan scouts rode through and through our ranks, while as soon as Hsien's general, Liang Fengchen, at the head of sixty horsemen, rode into the centre of the Fan army, they were all immediately seized and bound; Hsien had provided for nothing. Chiehtsan sent messengers to Hsien to say: \"I propose that the minister and his subordinates put on their official robes and hats, swords and jewels, and wait for instructions.\" This was to induce them to dismount from their horses so that they might be captured. Hsien, Ts'ui Hanheng and Sung Fengch'ao all entered the tent together, calm and unsuspecting. Chiehtsan ordered the drums to be\nbeaten three times, and his army came on shouting wildly. Hsien rushed out from the back of the tent and succeeded in catching a stray horse on which he mounted and galloped away. The horse had no bit in its mouth, and Hsien had to lean over its mane to guide it with his hands, and it was only after he had ridden for several miles that he got the bit into its mouth, and it was owing to this that the arrows of the pursuing horsemen passed by without wounding him. Only one of his generals, Hsin Jung, collected some hundreds of men, and occupying a hillock on the north fought with the enemy, and he was soon surrounded by the whole army, overpowered and forced to surrender. F\u00eangch\u2019ao and the Secretary were both killed by soldiers during the tumult. Hanh\u00eang and three eunuchs and a number of high officials, generals and secretaries, in all some sixty persons, were captured. Four or five hundred other officers, warriors and followers were killed, and over a thousand men carried away captive, all of whom had their clothes stripped off. When Hanh\u00eang was attacked by a crowd of warriors, his officer L\u00fc W\u00ean threw himself between and was wounded by the sword which Hanh\u00eang thus escaped. The latter said to those who had taken him prisoner in the foreign tongue: \u201cI am the Han envoy, the president Ts\u2019ui. Chiehtsan and I are friends, and if you kill me Chiehtsan will also kill you.\u201d Therefore they saved his life.\n\nThe captives were all driven off to the west, with their hands bound behind them, each one with a piece of wood reaching from the neck to the feet tied to his body with three pieces of hair rope, while they were fastened together by the hair with another rope. At night they were all thrown on the ground with the ropes fastened to the hair pegged down, and they were covered with pieces of felt, on which the guards lay down to prevent their escape. As soon as they reached the ancient Yuanchou, Chiehtsan, who was seated in his tent, had them brought before him, and repeatedly abused the government, and, enraged with Hun Hsien, said: \u201cThe victory at Wu-kung was due entirely to our power, and you promised us in return Chingchou and Lingchou, but you have\nall eaten your words and shown the deepest ingratitude, so that our whole nation is enraged. I broke through the ceremony in order to capture Hun Hsien, for whom I had had gilded fetters made, in which to present him to the tsanp'u. But he escaped, and I only succeeded in taking you. I will send three of you back.\" L\u00fc W\u00ean, still suffering from his wound, was also brought forward, and Chiehtsan praised his devotion and gave him valuable presents. Chiehtsan next led his army to Shihm\u00ean, and sent back to us the eunuch Ch\u00fc Wench\u00ean, the generals Ma Ning and Ma An. He sent Hanh\u00eang and his secretary to be imprisoned in Hochou, while the rest were shut up either in the ancient K'uocho or Shanchou.\n\nChiehtsan originally invited Tu Hsieh'uan and Li Kuan to take part in a sworn ceremony in order to capture the two governors-general, and to lead his bravest warriors to assault the capital. When they did not go, he then tried to capture Hun Hsien, and rode many times invading our borders, and plotting similar designs. The Emperor sent the eunuch Wang Tz\u00fbh\u00eang with despatches to Chiehtsan, but he was not admitted in the Fan borders and returned. When first Hsien and Lo Yuankuang were about to go to Chingchou, the latter said to Hsien: \"I am ordered by the Emperor to encamp at P'anyuanp'u, so as to be ready to help your Excellency. But this town is over twenty miles from the place of meeting, and the Fan are treacherous, so that if your Excellency should be in danger, I shall not know it; I propose therefore to pitch my camp closer, so as to be prepared for an emergency.\" But Hsien would not allow this in that it was contrary to the decree. Yuankuang, however, advanced simultaneously. Hsien's camp was some seven miles to the east of the place fixed for the sworn ceremony, while Yuankuang's camp was adjoining, encircled by deep trenches and high palisades, while the defences of the former could be crossed by a jump. When Hsien came flying back alone on horseback, the general he had left in command of his camp had lost control over his troops, and they had scattered and fled, so that when Hsien rode up there was only an empty camp, the material, weapons, money and provisions had all\ndisappeared. Happily Yuankuang's troops remained at their posts within his camp, and as soon as Hsien gained it the rebel horsemen who were in pursuit at once retired. Yuankuang sent on in front his baggage waggons and followed himself with Hsien, all obeyed his clear orders, kept steadily in their ranks and returned. Hsien afterwards fortified himself in Fengt'ien.\n\nIn the 6th month, on account of a great epidemic, the T'ufan burnt the city gates of Yenchou and Hsiachou, demolished the walls and withdrew, whereupon Tu Hsich'uan detached troops to occupy the cities.\n\nIn the 7th month this decree was issued: \"Of late the T'ufan have harassed the borders and destroyed the lives of the people, they have ravaged Lungtung and invaded far into Hoeh'i. Having but just put down the sword and spear, our wounded not yet healed, we resolved on a policy of rest from fighting and attack, and consented to their request for peace, in spite of our knowledge that the villainous barbarians were devoted to gain and covetous, and had often broken their bonds of alliance. We agreed to have a meeting for a sworn ceremony, but their secret guile was manifested, and they desecrated the solemn altar like a wicked and lying herd of sheep or dogs, and took advantage of the trusting faith of our civil and military officers who have thus fallen unprepared into danger. We are deeply grieved, for it is due entirely to our own want of understanding that things have come to such a pass; we have failed in virtue before the myriads of our people, and become a byword to the four quarters of the world. We mourn early and late, but repentance is unavailing, for now the President of the Board of War, Ts'ui Hanheng, and his colleagues, all good scholars of the nation and loyal ministers of our dynasty, are lying bound in round tents or lost in foreign countries. Compassionating their families, who are haply exposed to daily want, we hereby give posts to their children, so that some means of subsistence may be provided. Let Hanheng's son be promoted to an office of the seventh grade, and the sons of all the officers civil and military be\ngiven an official post, and let the proper officers immediately draw up a list of the names and rank and report to us.\"\n\nAfterwards T'ang Liangch'en was sent with 600 men to garrison P'anyuanp'u, and Su Taiping with 500 men to garrison Lungchou.\n\nIn the 8th month, Ts'ui Hanheng arrived from T'ufan. At first Hanheng and his fellow-captives were all taken to Hoehou, and Shangchiehtsean then ordered Hanheng, the general Meng Jihun, and the eunuch Lin Yenyung, to be brought to Shihmen and sent off, telling off 50 horsemen to escort them to the frontier, who also brought despatches and asked to be admitted, but as soon as they reached P'anyuan, Li Kuan sent to stop them and tell them that a decree had been issued forbidding the reception of Fan envoys. The despatches were retained, the men sent back. Thereupon, the T'ufan led an army of the Chi'iang and Hun (54) to attack the borders, encamping both at P'ank'ou and at Ch'inghsihling. The T'ufan army had previously marched from P'ank'ou eastwards in three divisions, the first to Lungchou, the second to the east of Ch'ienyang, the third to T'aokanyuan, and at this time they were all encamped in the places indicated, their tents stretching over several tens of li. The enemies' camp at Ch'ienyang was only thirteen miles from Fenghsiang, and the capital trembled with fear, the scholars and citizens running about distracted. They despatched Chi'iang and Hun troops dressed in Chinese armour, who pretended to belong to the army of Hising Chunyu, and suddenly appeared at Wushan, and the northern border of Paochi, where they burnt the dwelling-houses, carried off the inhabitants and their flocks, and decapitated the Wushan god. The able-bodied of the people were driven off, the sick and old massacred or thrown aside with hands cut off or eyes pierced. Li Ch'eng had had large trees felled at Fenghsiang to block the Anhua pass, but the enemy now burnt them all.\n\nIn the 9th month, the general Shih Chichang was ordered to take 3,000 men to garrison Wukung, and T'ang Liangch'en summoned from P'anyuan to garrison the city Poli. During this month, the T'ufan ravaged the lands of Ch'ienyang,\nWushan, and Huat'ing, and carried off over 10,000 men and women, all of whom were sent through the Anhua pass to the west to be distributed as slaves among the Ch'iang and Hun, who said to them: \"Look towards the east and weep a last farewell of your native country.\" All broke out into loud lamentation, several hundred died of grief on the spot, while more than a thousand threw themselves over precipices and were killed. When the news arrived, the whole nation mourned.\n\nHun Hsien despatched a general with 3,000 men to defend Haoss\u00fc. This month the Tufan army came again, and encamped at F\u00eangyi and at Huat'ing. The council deliberated on a plan for raising the Tufan siege. The governor of Lungchou, Han Ch'ingmien, and Su T'ai ping, led out troops in the night, who hid at Tahsiangk'an, and at midnight had fires lighted, both here and within the city, in answer to each other. The rebels were greatly alarmed, and when the camp was attacked, they retreated in disorder.\n\nAt this time, the Tufan attacked and took Huat'ing. When they began the siege of Huat'ing, they first cut off the water-supply. The general in command, who was besieged with his garrison, and the people, in all some 3,000 men, sent messengers by a bye-path to ask aid from Lungchou, the governor of which despatched Su T'ai ping at the head of 1,500 men. On the road some hundred straggling horsemen were destroyed by the enemy, and Su T'ai ping, who was naturally timorous, and had no aptitude for war, at once led his army back. The enemy, thereupon, every day sent some thousand light horse to Lungchou, and the city troops dared not sally out again. Four days after the water had been cut off, no troops coming to their succour, and the enemy having piled up wood to burn the city gates, the commandant surrendered. They burnt all the houses, dismantled the walls of the city, carried off three or four tenths of the inhabitants, taking the young and refusing the aged, and retired.\n\nOn the north they attacked and took Lienyump'u. This town was protected on three sides by lofty hills, and on the\nnorth, which looked on a plain, it was defended by a moat. The enemy built on the north side towers of seven stories for projecting stones into the town. There was only one well within the walls, and the stones in a little while choked this. They threw a flying bridge over the moat and crossing attacked energetically. The general and his people, some thousand men and women, turning to the east, wept bitterly and surrendered. This was the last remaining stronghold on the west of Chingchou, and every one waited to see whether the enemy would advance or retire after its capture. At Chingchou they dared not open the west gate, as all outside it was rebel territory. No one could go out to cut firewood, and to harvest the grain crops it was necessary to marshal troops in the night to gather them in, and as the corn was not ripe, most of the ears were empty, so that the citizens began to suffer from famine. When the T'ufan carried off the people of Lienyunp'u, the country people of Pinchou and Chingchou all fled to the mountains, with 10,000 head of oxen. The troops were removed to T'antsenchia, and wherever the enemy came within the borders of the chou of Pin, Lung, and Ching, they almost depopulated the districts. This autumn the inhabitants of these cities were famished for want of food, but the frontier generals did nothing but send reports of congratulation on the retreat of the enemy.\n\nIn the 10th month several thousand T'ufan horsemen again came to the city of Ch'angwu. Han Ch'\u00fcanyi led troops against them; he was a general of Yu Huai, and asked the latter for reinforcements, but was refused. At sunset the enemy retreated, and Ch'\u00fcanyi also retired. From this time the rebel horsemen passed and repassed through Chingchou and Pinchou, the west gates of which they dared not open. The enemy rebuilt the walls of the ancient Yuanchhou and occupied it with a large force.\n\nThe Emperor collected nearly 200 of the T'ufan captives, and had them executed in the streets to pacify the capital.\n\nIn the 4th year (788), the 5th month, over 30,000 T'ufan horsemen invaded the borders, and in separate bodies entered\nthe chou of Ching, Pin, Ning, Ch'ing and Fu. They burnt the offices and private houses of P'\u00eangyuanhsien, and wherever they went set fire to the dwellings, and drove off some 30,000 head of cattle, retiring after twenty days. Han Ch'\u00fcanyi led out troops from the city of Ch'angwu against them, but returned unsuccessful. Yu Huai had had no martial training, and he was besides sick and unable to rise, so that they shut up the city, and dared not come out to fight. On previous occasions, when the T'ufan invaded, they came only in the autumn and winter, returning home in the spring, when many of them were attacked by pestilence. When they came this time, the heat was at its greatest, and there was no danger of malaria; probably Chinese captives, who had been given money and land, and had their wives and children detained as hostages, acted as guides to the barbarians and secretly led them.\n\nIn the 9th month the T'ufan generals, Shanghsitunghsing and Lunmanglo, invaded Ningchou, the governor-general of which led an army against them and cut off over a hundred heads. The enemy turned to invade Fuchou and Fangchou and went away with their booty.\n\nIn the 5th year (789), the 10th month, the governor-general of Chiennan, Weikao, sent a general, Wang Yutao, and others, to accompany the Eastern Man Lianglin Tsunasbih and Wut\u00eang M\u00eangchung(55), who led troops to the ancient Ch\u00fcnchou, and at the north valley of T'a\u00eft\u00eang inflicted a great defeat on the two T'ufan governors-general of Ch'inghai and Liehch'\u00eang, killing the commanders-in-chief, Chr'itsangch\u00each\u00ea and Hsiotoyangchu, and cutting off more than 2000 heads, while those who fell from precipices, or were drowned in crossing the river, were too many to be counted. They made prisoners forty-five lungkuan, captured over 10,000 pieces of material and weapons, and over 10,000 head of oxen, horses and sheep. Ch\u00each\u00ea was a most famous warrior among the T'ufan, some said a son of Shangchiehtsean, and had been a constant danger to the borders. After his death, of all the cities and palisades attacked by the government troops, there was not one that did not succumb, and the Fan\narmy retreated daily, till in a few years all the territory of Chunhou was recovered.\n\nIn the 6th year (790) the T'ufan took our Peit'ing vice-royalty. Peit'ing and Anhs(56) had borrowed a road of communication from the Huiho (Ouigours), the government reports and tribute being thus able to be forwarded. The barbarians are naturally covetous and rapacious, and want everything without exception, and the Chi'ang tribes near to Peit'ing plundered the people of their stores of clothes, material and provisions, so that they wished for death. There were 60,000 tents of the Shat'o(57) people adjacent to Peit'ing, which were also subject to the Huiho, and the Huiho never ceased from plundering them, so that they were reduced to great distress. The Kolu(58) people and the white-robed T'uchih\u00fceh were on friendly terms of intercourse with the Huiho, and yet had to complain of their robberies, and consequently, when the T'ufan sent them valuable presents to bribe them, they gave in their allegiance. Thereupon the Tu'fan led the Kolu and the White-robed people, and last year the united forces invaded Peit'ing. The Huiho chief minister, Chiehkanchiass\u00fc, led an army to its relief, and fought several battles, but was desperately beaten, and the T'ufan pressed the siege more fiercely. The natives of Peit'ing had suffered bitterly from the Huiho, and during the present year all the cities surrendered to the T'ufan. The Shat'o people also gave in their submission. The governor-general of Peit'ing, Yang Hsiku, having collected some 2,000 of his bannermen, fled away to Hsichou(59). Chiehkanchiass\u00fc, having been unsuccessful, returned.\n\nIn the autumn of the 7th year (791), all the able-bodied men, amounting to between fifty and sixty thousand, tried to reconquer Peit'ing, and summoned Yang Hsiku to march with them. They were soon attacked by the T'ufan and Kolu, totally defeated, and the greater half killed. Chiehkanchiass\u00fc said with deceitful intent: \"If you go with me to our sovereign's tent, we will send your Excellency back to your own court.\" Hsiku consented, but as soon as he arrived, he was detained instead of being sent on, and was afterwards\nput to death. In consequence of this loss, Anhai was blocked and cut off, and we knew not whether it were taken or no; only the men of Hsichou continued to defend their city. While Chiehkanchiassu was still smarting from his defeat, the Kolu followed up their victory by the conquest of the Huiho Fut'ouch'uan(60). The Huiho trembled with fear, and removed the sheep and horses of all the tribes of Hsichou to the south of the sovereign encampment to escape the enemy.\n\nIn the 8th year (792), the 4th month, the T'ufan invaded Lingchou(61), and drove away men and animals. They attacked and took the city of Shuik'ou, and advancing besieged the chou city, barricading Shuik'ou and Chiho'h'\u00fc, and establishing stationary camps there. The Emperor ordered soldiers to be detached from Hotung and Ch\u00eanwei to relieve the city, and sent over 3,000 soldiers of the imperial armies to garrison the two cities of Tingyuan and Huaiyuan, proceeding himself to one of the palaces to see them start. The T'ufan led their forces away.\n\nIn the 6th month several thousand T'ufan horsemen invaded Chingchou from the Ch'ingshihling, and carried off over a thousand of the local militia. As they were returning by Lienyunp'u, the commandant of the town sent out troops to attack them, and a chief general was killed.\n\nIn the 9th month, the governor-general of Hsich'uan Wei Kao besieged the T'ufan Weichou, and took prisoner the great general Luntsanjo and other chiefs, whom he sent to the capital.\n\nIn the 11th month, the governor-general of Shannan Hsitao, Yen Ch\u00ean, attacked and defeated the T'ufan at Fang-chou, and at Heishuip'u burnt the stores, and presented all the captive chiefs to the Emperor.\n\nIn the 9th year (793), the 2nd month, a decree was issued to wall Yenchou. The city had been demolished by the T'ufan, so that there was no place of refuge outside this barrier, Ling and Wu being too distant. On the west it bordered on Fu and Fang, which harassed the borders exceedingly, therefore the Emperor ordered the city to be rebuilt. The work was finished in twenty days, and the\nEmperor ordered Hokan Sui, at the head of 5,000 soldiers, and the army of Su Yenkuang, to garrison it. The sovereign, thinking of the dangerous duty of the officers and warriors, ordered the Treasury to make liberal provision for them. He also commanded the armies of Chingyuan, Hunan and Shannan to invade T'ufan deeply, so as to divert their forces, and consequently, during the process of building the wall, the enemy did not attack the barrier. When all was completed, the citizens and country people were unanimous in praise.\n\nThe same month Wei Kao sent from Hsich'uan captive T'ufan chiefs, war material, weapons and banners, oxen and horses, to the Emperor. When he had resolved to wall Yenchou, the sovereign ordered Kao to lead an army as a diversion to the T'ufan troops. Kao sent the chief general Tungmien Changf\u00ean from Hsishan to the southern province, and he defeated the army of T'ungho at the city Eho. The T'ufan commander-in-chief of the southern province, Lun-mangj\u00eat (the New History adds Molungch'ihsipi), at the head of an army, came to its relief, and he was also defeated, with the loss of several thousands killed and wounded. He burnt the ancient city of Singlien, and stormed over fifty fortified and walled towns.\n\nIn the 10th year (794), M\u00eang Yimoubhs\u00fcn(62), the ruler of the Nanchao Man, inflicted a great defeat on the T'ufan at Sh\u00eanc'huan, and sent envoys with the news of his victory, as described in the Nanchao Record.\n\nIn the 11th year (795), the 8th month, Huang Shaoch'ing attacked and took the four chou\u2014Ch'in, Hung, Ha\u00fbn, and Fei. The T'ufan generals Lunch'ijan, T'angmutsang, and Hsinolo, with their families and followers, came to offer allegiance, and in the following year they were all appointed generals of the empire.\n\nIn the 12th year (796), the 9th month, the T'ufan invaded Ch'ingchou and Huach'ihhsien, and a large number were killed and wounded.\n\nThis year Shangchichtsean died. In the 13th year (797) the tsanp'a died, and his son Turchihchichen succeeded.\n\nIn the 13th year (797), the 1st month, Hsing Chunya\nmemorialized to ask that seventy li to the west of Lungchou a city be built for a defence against the western barbarians, to be called the city of Yunghsin.\n\nThe T'ufan tsanp'u sent an envoy, Nungseohsi, with despatches, asking for a renewal of friendly relations. When the frontier generals reported this, the Sovereign, because of their wolfish nature they had repeatedly shown ingratitude for favours, and broken treaties, declined to receive the despatches, and ordered the envoy to be sent back.\n\nOn the 17th day of the 5th month the T'ufan, having penetrated the Shammaling by three roads into Chiennan, pitched three separate camps, and in less than a month advanced their armies as far as the city of T'ai't'\u00eang. The governor of Ch\u00fcnchou, Ts'ao Kaoshih, at the head of the officers and soldiers of the different armies, and the young men of the Eastern Man, with united forces engaged them, and severely defeated them from early morn to noon. They made prisoners seven chief lung officers, and killed and captured 300 men in the battle, while of the remainder more than could be counted fell to the sword and spear. They took also 500 head of horses and oxen, and 2,000 pieces of war material and weapons.\n\nIn the 14th year (798), the 10th month, the governor-general of Hsiachou, Han Ch'\u00fcanyi, defeated the T'ufan to the north-west of Yenchou.\n\nIn the 16th year (800), the 6th month, the T'ufan were defeated in Yenchou, on the Wulan Bridge.\n\nWei Kao took the two cities Mokung and Jung.\n\nIn the 17th year (801), the 7th month, the T'ufan invaded Yenchou, and took Linchou, killing the governor of the city. They dismantled the city walls, plundered the inhabitants, and drove off as they went away the Tanghsiang tribes. When they had got thirty miles to the west of Yenchou, they encamped their army at H\u00eangts'aof\u00eang. They summoned from Yenchou the Buddhist monk Yensu, with six of his colleagues, with the message that the officer Hs\u00fc wanted to see the brethren. The T'ufan Mol\u00each\u00fc fetched Yensu and his companions, and brought them with all speed\nbefore a tent, their hands tied with leathern thongs, and with hair-ropes round their necks. They saw a T'fan, young in years, over six feet high, with red beard and large eyes, who it appeared was the officer Hs\u00fc. He ordered their bonds to be loosed, seated them within the tent, and said to them: \"Fear not, reverend sirs! I am by descent a man of Han, a grandson in the fifth generation of the President of the Board of Works, the Duke of Yingkuo. In consequence of the massacre of the imperial house by the Empress Wu Hou, although our ancestor Kaotsu founded his dynasty in China, his descendants have removed to foreign countries, and remained there for three generations. Although we have all accepted office and held military command, yet have we never ceased to remember our origin; but it was the only means of saving the blood of our house. This is the frontier of the Fan and Han, thirty miles farther we shall arrive at Anl\u00e9chou, and you will have no chance of returning to the east.\" Yensu replied: \"We are solitary monks, and our relatives are aged; we entreat your pity to save our lives, and are unable to restrain our tears.\" He then said: \"I received orders to lead an army to protect the borders, and in order to get stores and provisions, we marched over the Han frontier, and advanced gradually to the east till we came to the city of Linchou, which was undefended by troops and isolated from succour, so that we succeeded in taking it. I knew that his Excellency the governor Kuo was the descendant of a loyal minister, and was therefore anxious to save his life, but unfortunately he was killed during the confusion. A 'flying bird messenger' (mounted courier) unexpectedly arrived with the message: 'The soothsayers have reported a change in affairs, and the troops are recalled with all speed.' Therefore we are withdrawing.\"\n\nAt this time a decree ordered Wei Kao to despatch generals with a force of 20,000 foot and horse from Ch'\u00eangtu, through the north and south of the western mountains by nine roads, and to advance together to attack the cities Hsieh and Laow\u00eang, and the ancient chou of Wei, Pao, and Sung(63), for the purpose of a diversion from the northern\nborders. In the 9th month Wei Kao greatly defeated the T'ufan at Yachou.\n\nIn the 18th year (802), the 1st month, the T'ufan great chief, Lummangj\u00ea, having been made prisoner by Wei Kao, was sent to the Emperor, who gave him a house in the Ts'ungj\u00eanli to live in. Mangj\u00ea is the T'ufan Chief Minister of the Interior. In the 16th year of Ch\u00e9nyuan (800), Wei Kao had successively defeated an army of over 20,000 Tufan at Lichou and Ch\u00fcnchou. The T'ufan then made a grand levy of warriors, entrenched them, and built boats, with the intention of secretly invading the borders. Wei Kao destroyed everything, and thereupon the T'ufan commander-in-chief and governor-general of nine cities, Yingying, the Lung officer, Matingt\u00ea(64), and eighty-seven of their chief generals, with all their people, surrendered. Matingt\u00ea was a skilful tactician, and Yingying was versed in the art of war, as well as in the hills, rivers, and formation of the ground. Whenever the T'ufan raised troops, Matinct\u00ea used to ride to the spot to consult and advise the generals, all depending on him for the plan of campaign. Now that he had been unsuccessful in the border-war, he was afraid of being punished, and made up his mind to surrender. The following year (801) over 1,000 families of the Kuan Mo and Hsieh Man, of the T'ufan city of K'unming, also gave in their allegiance. The T'ufan, seeing that their people were melting away, invaded on the north Ling and So, and took Linchou; and Wei Kao was ordered to send an expedition from Ch'\u00eangtu as a diversion from the northern frontier. Kao thereupon appointed Ch'en P'o to lead 10,000 soldiers by the Sanch'i road; Ts'in Yaoch'\u00ean to lead 1000 by the Lunghan Shihm\u00e9n road; the commander-in-chief of Wei and Pao, and the governor of Pao and Pa, to lead 2,000 to assault the T'ufan city of Weichou; Hsing Tz'u, with the governors of the different chou, at the head of 4,000, to advance and attack the cities of Hsichi and Laow\u00eang; Kao T'i to lead 2,000 to invade the ancient Sungchou; and Yuan Ying to detach generals with 8,000 soldiers from the south by the Ya, Chi'ung, Li, and Ch\u00fcn roads. He also ordered\nWei Liangchin to take 1,300 soldiers to garrison Yachou, Lu Weiming, and the chief of the three tribes, Chao Jihchin, at the head of 3,000 soldiers, to invade and attack the cities P'utsu and P'iensung; Wang Yutao to lead 2,000 of the three tribes with Hochinhsin to cross the Tatu River, and invade deep into T'ufan territory; Ch'en Hsiaoyang and others, with Chunashih, the chief of the three tribes of the Kuan, Mo, and Heieh Man, with 4,000 men, to advance and attack the cities of K'unming and Nochi.\n\nFrom the 8th month till the 12th month they defeated in succession 160,000 men, carried by assault seven cities, and five fortified camps, received the submission of over 3,000 families, took 6,000 prisoners, and cut off more than 10,000 heads. Afterwards they besieged Weichou, to relieve which two armies came, and battles were fought over a thousand li, in which the T'ufan were successively defeated. The armies invading Ling and So were then drawn off and brought down to the south. The tsanp'u despatched Mangj\u00e9, the chief minister of the interior, with the appointment of military governor-general of the five provinces of the eastern border, to be generalissimo, with 100,000 men of the different barbarian people under his command, to raise the siege of Weichou. The imperial army of 10,000 men occupied a difficult pass, and lay in ambush to wait for them, while some 1,000 were sent on in front to provoke a battle. Mangj\u00e9, seeing the small number of our army, came on in pursuit with his whole force, and fell into the ambush. Our generals attacked desperately on all sides, and captured Mangj\u00e9, and the enemy was entirely dispersed.\n\nIn the 19th year (803), the 5th month, a T'ufan envoy, Lunchiaj\u00e9, arrived. In the 6th month the general Hs\u00fceh P'i was sent on a mission to the T'ufan.\n\nIn the 20th year (804), the 3rd month, within the first ten days, the tsanp'u died. The imperial court was closed for three days, and the Vice-President of the Board of Works, Chang Chien, was appointed to console and sacrifice.\n\nThe tsanp'u who died in the 4th month of the 13th year (797) of Ch\u00eanyuan was succeeded by his eldest son, who\ndied one year after, when the second son succeeded to the throne.\n\nThe Emperor ordered all the civil and military officials above the third grade to condolence with the envoy.\n\nIn the 4th month, the T'ufan envoys Tsang (some characters lost here) Lunch'ijan, and the Buddhist monk Nanpot'echip'o, in all fifty-four persons, came to court. In the 12th month, their envoys, Lunhsij\u00ea and Kuochiht'sung, came to have audience.\n\nIn the 21st year (805), the 2nd month, Shuntsung appointed T'ien Chingtu to go with special credentials to T'ufan with the intelligence of the late Emperor's decease, Hsiung Chihyi being sent as assistant-envoy.\n\nIn the 7th month a T'ufan mission, headed by Lunhsino, came to court.\n\nIn the 1st year of Yungch\u00ean (805), the 10th month, the tsanp'u sent Lunch'iloup'utsang, who brought as tribute offerings for the mausoleum of T\u00eatsung, gold and silver, robes, oxen, and horses.\n\nIn the 11th month, a mission was sent to inform them of the accession of the new Emperor, etc.\n\nIn the 1st year of Yuanho (806), the 1st month, seventeen T'ufan prisoners, sent from Fuchientao, arrived, and the Emperor ordered them to be given post-horses, and sent back to their own country. In the 6th month, their envoy Lunputsang came to court.\n\nWith 50,000 horsemen they invaded Fu'tich'uan in Ch\u00eanwu, and 10,000 horsemen came to Tashikhu in Fengchou, and plundered the Hulhu, who were returning to their country.\n\nIn the 5th year (810), Hai Fu was sent as envoy to them, carrying a despatch also for the Poshanpu. The Poshanpu was a Fu'u (Buddhist) of the barbarians, who had the control of state affairs, also written Poch'\u00eap'u. Hai Fu went as far as Shanchou, and then came back without leave. The assistant-envoy Li Feng carried the Emperor's commands to the tsanp'u. Fu was punished by degradation.\n\nIn the 5th year (810), the 5th month, their envoy Lunss\u00fbyaj\u00ea came to court, and brought back in coffins the bodies of Cheng Shuch\u00fc and Lu Pi, as well as W\u00e9nyen, the son of Shuch\u00fc, and others, in all thirteen persons. Shuch\u00fc and Pi were taken at the sworn ceremony at P'ingliang,\nand during more than twenty years they refused to bow down in homage, and died among the Fan. At this time they asked for peace, and therefore sent them back.\n\nIn the 6th month, the Emperor ordered the minister of state, Tu Yu, and his colleagues, to consult on the question with the T'ufan envoy in one of the government halls, and they reported, recommending the return of our territory of the chou of Ch'in, Yuan, and Anl\u00ea. In the 7th month, the Emperor sent Li Ming as envoy to the T'ufan, with Wu Hui as assistant-envoy.\n\nFrom the 6th to the 10th years (811\u2013815), they sent envoys to court with tribute without intermission.\n\nThey asked for the establishment of an exchange mart at the Lungchou barrier, which was allowed by decree.\n\nIn the 12th year (817), the 4th month, a T'ufan envoy, Lunch'ijan, came to bring the news of the death of the tsanp'u. The Emperor appointed envoys to go on a mission of condolence and sacrifice.\n\nK'oik'otse succeeded as tsanp'u. The mission brought back with them two officers who had been taken in battle 30 years before, whom the envoy, knowing that they were not dead, sought out.\n\nIn the 13th year (818), the 10th month, the T'ufan besieged our Yuchou and Fenghsiang, presenting despatches that they were sending a mission to renew friendly relations.\n\nIn the same month, the army of Lingwu, at the city of Tingyuan, defeated 20,000 T'ufan, slaying 2,000 men, taking prisoners one lieutenant-governor-general and thirty-nine officers, and capturing large numbers of sheep and horses.\n\nThe commander of the P'ingliang garrison defeated an army of over 20,000, recovered the city of Yuanchou, and captured innumerable sheep and horses. The governor-general of Hsiachou also defeated an army of 3,000 at Lingwu.\n\nIn the 11th month, a despatch was received from Yenchou that the T'ufan had invaded Hoch'\u00fc, and at Hsiachou defeated over 50,000 men, and at Lingwu destroyed Ch'angochou and Ioch'\u00eang, and burnt the dwelling-houses, stores, and weapons.\n\nA decree was issued to detain Lunchilitsang and his colleagues, who had been sent on a mission to the Emperor.\nThe governor-general of Hsich'uan took by assault the cities of Echo and Haichi.\n\nIn the 14th year (819), the 1st month, this decree was issued: \"We are endowed with rule over the myriad countries, and keep faithfully our plighted word. The western barbarians have brought tribute for a series of years, and although they have meanwhile been occasionally contumacious, we have overlooked it, and they ought not to forget our manifold virtue towards them. With language requiring several interpreters, and tribute of precious things, they travel in constant succession, and we have shown grace and hospitality to all without exception. Yesterday Fan envoys, bringing despatches, again came to our capital, and in obedience to the command of their sovereign, discussed a policy of friendly alliance. We received them in our audience hall, entertained them liberally in a hotel, rewarded them with special presents, and entrusted to them an official despatch, and they took leave. They had but just reached the suburbs, when it was reported that a swarm of ants had invaded our borders, and were carrying slaughter and confusion throughout Hoch\u00fc, ungrateful for our benevolence, and in violation of the treaty, conduct for which they give no pretext, and the council and the people ask unanimously that they shall be exterminated. But we grieve deeply that our virtue has not been sufficient to transform them, and how can we be angry with the want of submission of barbarians? The state has broken its faith, but these envoys are not guilty. Let them be released and given their freedom, let them be shown our grand clemency and relieved from anxiety, and when they learn our faithfulness, let them be grateful. The Fan envoy Lunch\u00fclitsang, and his colleagues, as well as the mission which came afterwards, are all to be sent back to their own country, and the governor-general of F\u00eanghsiang is to explain clearly to them the grounds of this resolution.\"\n\nIn the 8th month, the T'ufan encamped at Fangch'\u00fc in Ch'ingchou, and a large army came to the borders of Hochou.\n\nIn the 10th month, the T'ufan governor-general Lunsanmo;\nwith the minister of state, Shangt'atsang, and the president of the council, Shangch'ihsin'rh, at the head of an army of about 150,000 men, invested our city of Yenchou in several lines. The chiefs of the Tanghsiang also led warriors to drive sheep and horses for their use. During thirty days the enemy, with flying ladders, goose-carts, and wooden mules, attacked simultaneously on four sides, and the city was well nigh lost several times. But the governor Li W\u00e9nyueh, at the head of his officers and warriors, fought bravely on the top of the wall. When the wall was pierced, and no longer tenable, they pulled down the houses for planks to repair it, and fought in the breach day and night. When the troops came by surprise and destroyed the enemy's camp, they opened the city gates and sallied out to fight, and slew about 10,000 of the rebel army, but the soldiers sent in aid from the different provinces had not arrived. After twenty-seven days the enemy withdrew.\n\nThe governor of Shachou(65), Chou Ting, at first held it strongly for the T'ang. The tsamp'u moved his tent to the Nanhan(66), and despatched Shangch'ihsin'rh to attack it. Ting asked succour of the Huihu, but a year passed without its coming, and they deliberated on the project of burning the city, and fleeing with the troops to the east, but all agreed that this would not do. Ting ordered the commander of the troops, Yen Ch'ao, to lead a strong body out to forage for grass. He called at daybreak for a farewell visit, and engaged Chou Shann, a confidential officer of the governor, for a shooting match. When the bows were drawn, each invited the other to shoot first. He shot Shann and killed him, and then made the governor prisoner and strangled him, and undertook himself the government of the city. After having defended the city for eight years, they brought out silk, offering a roll in exchange for a measure of corn, and a great many took advantage of the opportunity, so that Ch'ao was rejoiced, and said: \"The people all have food, and we will defend the city to death.\" But after two years more the provisions and war stores were all used up, and he mounted on the wall and shouted: \"If you will not remove us to other lands, we offer to surrender the city.\" Ch'ihsin'rh consented, and he went out and surrendered. From the attack of the city to this time it was altogether eleven years. The tsamp'u appointed Ch'ihsin'rh in his place as governor, who afterwards, suspecting that Ch'ao was plotting a revolt, put poison in his boots, and killed him. The inhabitants of the city all adopted the foreign dress, and submitted to the enemy; but each year when they worshipped their ancestors, they put on their Chinese clothes, and wept bitterly as they put them by.\n\nIn the 15th year (820), the 2nd month, T'ien Chi'i was sent to T'ufan to inform them of the death of the Emperor, and also of the accession of his successor.\nIn the 3rd month they attacked and plundered our Ch'ingsaifeng, and invaded Chingchou, camping along the river for fifty li.\n\nIn the 7th month they sent to court a mission of condolence and sacrifice.\n\nIn the 10th month they came secretly to invade Chingchou. The Emperor appointed Liang Shouchien commander-in-chief, and sent him with 4,000 of the imperial troops, and all the armies of the eight garrisons, to the relief of the city; and despatched Shao T'ung as envoy with special credentials to the T'ufan, in answer to their mission asking for a renewal of peaceful relations.\n\nThe preceding envoy to the T'ufan was punished by being degraded to a revenue post at Liuchou. When he went to the Fan on a mission of condolence, they proposed a meeting for a sworn ceremony under the walls of Ch'angwu city. Feeble, and afraid that they would not let him return, he consented to everything; and when now the western barbarians came plundering, they said: \"T'ien Ch'i agreed that we should lead troops and march to conclude a sworn treaty.\" He was degraded in consequence, although the barbarians were really angry for having been troubled by the frontier generals, and only used the envoy as a pretext.\n\nThe governor of Chingchou reported that the T'ufan generals had all retired, whereupon the Emperor ordered the army to be disbanded.\n\nFrom the time that T'ien Chin was made ruler of Hsiachou, he covetously and tyrannically oppressed the people, and the Tanghsiang suffered bitterly, and repeatedly led the barbarians to invade the borders, till now a large army invaded. The frontier general Ho Tz'u several times stormed and invaded the Fan fortifications and slew vast numbers. Afterwards Li Kuangyen arrived with all his army from Pinchou, and the enemy, frightened, retreated. T'ien Chin was the origin of the danger to the state, but happily Kuangyen and Ho Tz'u drove off and slaughtered them.\n\nIn the 11th month the governor-general of Hsiachou led his troops to Ch'angts'ech'en, and the governor-general of\nLingwa led his forces to Ch'angchhou, both having received orders to attack the T'ufan.\n\nIn the 12th month, over a thousand T'ufan besieged Wu-pai-chih.\n\nIn the 1st year of Ch'angch'ing (821), the 6th month, they attacked Li-ingsip'a, on account of our having made a treaty and alliance with the Huibo(67). The governor of Yenchou despatched troops to advance against them.\n\nIn the 9th month the T'ufan sent an envoy, Shangeh-tli-t'oua, to ask for a sworn treaty. The Emperor consented. The ministers, wishing to add weight to the affair, proposed to proclaim it in the ancestral temple; but the president of the ceremonial court memorialized: \"I have respectfully referred, and find that, on the old occasions, when the Emperors Sutsung and Taitenng concluded sworn treaties with the T'ufan, neither proclaimed it in the temple, and that only Tetsung, when, at the end of the Chienchung period, he concluded a sworn treaty with the T'ufan at the Yemp'ing Gate, wishing to make the oaths more binding, specially ordered it to be proclaimed in the temple. In the 3rd year of Chenyuan (787), when there was a meeting at P'ingliang, there is also no record of its having been proclaimed in the temple. I humbly submit that there is only one solitary instance, and that it has not been the constant practice. I have referred to the ritual statutes, in which there is also no mention of it; and now, after respectful investigation and thought, I fear that it ought not to be so proclaimed.\" This memorial was followed. The Emperor appointed the director of the court of revision, Lin Yuanting, as envoy, to conclude a sworn treaty with T'ufan, and the secretary of the board of war, Liu Shihlao, assistant envoy, with Li Wu and Li Kungtu as secretaries of the mission.\n\nOn the 10th day of the 10th month the sworn ceremony was performed with the T'ufan envoys, the ministers of state, the presidents of the six boards, the directors of the sacrificial worship and revenue courts, the governor of the metropolis, and one of the generals, in all ten high officials, taking part.\n\nThe text was: \"The T'ang have received from heaven rule...\"\nover the eight points of the compass, and wherever their wise commands penetrate, all come to their court, and with awe and reverence, fearful of punishment for their misdeeds. Successors of Wu, and imitators of W\u00ean, each emperor has acquired additional fame, and excelled in showing deeper wisdom, and none have failed in the glorious succession of twelve reigns, during two hundred and four years. The great founder of our dynasty issued wise commands, and his rules are not to be broken; he acquired wide-spreading fame, and it will be handed down for ever. They worship the high god and receive a favourable response; they pray to the souls of their imperial ancestors, and obtain abounding happiness; how can there be a break?\n\n\"In the cyclical year kuei ch'ou(68), in the winter, on the cyclical day kuei yu, of the 10th month of the year, the W\u00ean-wu-hsiao-t\u00ea Huangti(69) decreed that the ministers of state, his servant Chih, his servant Po, and his servant Yuan-ying, should conclude a sworn treaty with the great general, the Fan envoy, Lunnalo, President of the Board of Rites, and his colleagues, at the capital, on an altar built in the western suburb of the city, with a pit dug on the north side of the altar. We have recited the oaths, sacrificed the victims, and buried them together with the written text, reverently ascended and descended the altar, and performed all the proper ceremonies without omission.\n\n\"Now, therefore, weapons shall be put by, and men be given rest, the bonds of kinship be honoured, and friendship re-established; the far-reaching policy has been carried out, and will produce abundant fruit. As the vault of heaven above overspreads the yellow earth below, so the swarming multitude of men look for rulers towards the ministers and high officers, for if left without leaders they would prey on and destroy each other. What the Chinese now rule shall have the T'ang as the sovereign, and the country of their western race shall have the great Fan as ruler. From this time henceforward both shall put by weapons and armour, forget their differences and old grievances, and respect the honoured kinship of their sovereigns and the ancient bonds of mutual\naid. The frontier guard-houses shall be left ungarrisoned, and the watch-fires no longer lighted; in danger and difficulty they shall think of each other, and oppression and plunder be stopped; the barrier stations and fortifications shall be disused and invasion and plunder shall cease. The important strong posts of defence shall be carefully kept as of old: they shall not plot against us, and we will make no preparations against them.\n\n\"Ah! Love, men with benevolence, protect your country with loyalty, worship heaven with wisdom, and serve the gods with reverence; for if any one of these duties be neglected, it will bring down misfortune upon the body.\n\n\"The frontier mountains are lofty(70),\nThe River flows on unceasingly:\nOn a propitious day and favourable season\nHave we fixed the two boundaries,\nThe west to belong to the great Fan,\nThe east to be ruled by the grand T'ang:\nThe great ministers, holding up the sworn treaty,\nProclaim it afar to the autumn country.\"\n\nThe tsanp'u of the great Fan, the state ministers, the Poch'anpu and Shangch'ihsin'rh, had sent the treaty beforehand, the important articles of which were: \"The two countries Fan and Han shall keep the borders which each one now rules, and neither shall fight with nor attack the other, they shall allow no plundering raids into each other's border, nor secret plots to acquire territory. If any persons be suspected, they shall be taken alive, and their business inquired into, then they shall be given clothes and food, and sent back to their own country. All now fixed shall be followed, there shall be neither addition nor change. The officers who take part in the sworn ceremony, seventeen persons, shall all sign their names\"(71).\n\nWhen Liu Yuanting and his colleagues accompanied Lunnalo on his return to T'ufan to conclude the sworn treaty in their country, the Emperor commanded Yuanting on his arrival to instruct the ministers and the lesser officers all to write their names below the text of the treaty.\n\nThe governor-general of Lingwu defeated an army of 3,000 T'ufan horsemen under the T'aikushan.\nIn the 2nd year (822), the 2nd month, a mission despatched by them arrived to ask for a settlement of the boundaries. In the 6th month, another mission arrived at court.\n\nThe governor of Yenchou reported that over 2,000 T'ufan had invaded the borders of Lingwu, and that he had despatched troops in pursuit and chastised them. He also said that he had captured 150 T'ufan who were carrying despatches to the Tanghsiang.\n\nThe same 6th month, Liu Yuanting returned from his mission to T'ufan, and reported to the Emperor: \"On the 25th day of the 4th month we arrived at the T'ufan capital (chief camp), and on the 6th day of the 5th month the sworn treaty was concluded.\"\n\nYuanting, on his first journey to and from the Fan country, on each occasion passed through Hochou, where he had an interview with their commander-in-chief, the president of the council, Shangch'ihsin'rh (according to the New History Shangt'atsangy\u00fc), who said to him: \"The Huiho is a petty state, and in the cyclical year ping sh\u00ean (816), when we crossed the desert to attack them, we drove them before us till within two days' journey of their capital city, which we intended to destroy as soon as we reached it. But at this moment we received the intelligence of the death of our sovereign, and consequently returned. The Huiho being as feeble as this, how is it that the T'ang treat them more honourably than they treat us?\" Yuanting replied: \"The Huiho have the credit of having rescued the state when in difficulties, and, moreover, they have never robbed us of even one inch of territory. Ought we not therefore to treat them with honour?\"\n\nOn the present occasion, Yuanting, on his journey to and fro, crossed the upper stream of the Yellow River,\n\nYuanting crossed the Huang River and came to the Lungch'\u00fcan valley, to the north-west of which he saw Shaluhch'\u00fcan, the ancient fortifications of Koshu Han, of which there was still much remaining. The Huang River flows to M\u00eanghu, and to Lungch'\u00fcan, where it joins the Yellow River.\n\nmore than 2000 li south-west of the Hungchi Bridge(72). The water is here very shallow, and the stream narrow, so\nthat in the spring it can be forded, although in the summer and autumn boats are required to cross over. Some 300 li to the south of this point, there are three mountains like circular, flat-bottomed coppers in shape.\n\nCalled the Ts'i (Purple) Mountains, which bound the Greater Yangt'ung(73) country. These are the ancient K'unlun Mountains. They are called by the Tibetans the M\u00eanmoli Mountains. Ch'angan is 5000 li distant to the east.\n\nThe source of the Yellow River is in the midst of these mountains. The water is very pure and clear, but as it flows past other streams it changes to red; and afterwards, when it has been joined by more tributaries, it gradually becomes yellow and turbid.\n\nFrom the source westwards to the Fan Lieh kuan (hotel) is a distance of four days' journey, each day estimated at 200 li(74). North-east of the same lies the Mohoyen Chiwei, which is 50 li broad, becoming gradually narrower and smaller towards the south. This stretches from the west of Shachou on the north, southwards into the T'uhun(75) country, till it reaches this point, where it becomes so small and narrow that it is called Chiwei (Tail of the desert). Geographically it is reckoned to be due west of Ch'ienan (S\u00eaich'\u00fcan).\n\nYuanting crossed Wuch'\u00fcan in Ch'engchi, and came to Wuliang in Hokuang, the ancient walls of which city had not been destroyed. The country of Lanchou(76) was full of rice, peach and plum-trees, elms and willows, of which flourished luxuriantly. The inhabitants were all men of T'ang (Chinese); and when they saw the banners and umbrellas of the envoy, they lined the road to gaze. On his arrival at the city of Lungchih(77), a thousand old men came to visit him, and weeping, asked after the welfare of the Son of Heaven, saying: \"We came to this place with the army, and were lost here. To this day our sons and grandsons are unwilling to forget the T'ang dress. Does the Emperor still think of us? What day will the troops come?\" When they had spoken, all broke out into loud lamentation. On secret inquiry they were found to be men of F\u00eangchou. He passed the city of Shibin(78), where precipices stand upright like walls, and the path winds and returns. The Tibetans call this Iron-sword city. On the right of the road for some tens of li the earth and rocks are all red, and the Tibetans call this the Ch'ihling(79) (Red Pass). The boundary stones, placed here by Wei, Prince of Hsinan, and by Chang Shoukuei, had both been thrown down, and only the stones erected by the Tibetans remained. Ch'ihling is three thousand and more li distant from Ch'angan, it is in the old territory of Lungyu.\n\nYuanting had his first interview with the tsanp'u at M\u00ean-ch\u00fclu ch'\u00fcan, where the tsanp'u had his summer residence. This valley is one hundred li south of the valley of Loso, and the Tsang River flows through it.\nThe country to the south-west of the Yellow River is flat, like a whitestone\u2014an uncultivated plain, richly covered with grass, with many tamarisk and willow-trees on the banks of the river, while the mountains are covered with cypresses. The crests are crowned with sepulchral mounds, with buildings beside them plastered with red earth, on which are painted white tigers\u2014all tombs of Tibetan nobles who had gained fame in battle. When alive they wore the tiger-skin, and it is a sign of their valour when dead; their comrades, who killed themselves at the time, lie buried alongside. He crossed the Haichiahiho Pass, where the rocks were cut to make a road for the carts accompanying the Princess of Chinch'\u00eang. When the envoy reached Miku, he came to his hotel. The northern valley of the Tsang(80) River is the summer residence of the tsanp'u. His tent was surrounded by a fence of spears; and a hundred halberds, with long handles and hooked heads, stood upright, with an interval of some ten paces between them; while in the middle large flags were erected. There were three gates, each a hundred paces distant from the other. Armed warriors guarded these gates, and sorcerers recited prayers, with bird-shaped hats and tiger-girdles, beating drums the while. All comers were searched before they were allowed to enter. In the centre there was a high platform, surrounded by a circle of jewelled balusters. The tsanp'u was seated in the centre of the tent, which was ornamented with gold figures of dragons, lizards, tigers, and leopards. He was dressed in a plain cloth costume, his head enveloped in folds of bright red-coloured silk, and he was girt with a sword inlaid with gold. On his right hand stood the Poch'\u00eap'u(81), the ministers of state being stationed below the platform. After the first arrival of the T'ang envoy, the councillor Lunhsit\u00e2j\u00e9 had come to negotiate the terms of the sworn treaty. There was a great feast on the right of the tent, at which the food was served and the wine passed round in much the same fashion as in China. The musicians played 'The Prince of Ch'in defeating his enemies'(82), and also Liang-chou foreign airs and other songs; and there were a hundred games exhibited, the performers in which were all Chinamen.\n\nThe ceremonial altar was ten paces wide, and two feet high. Our envoys stood opposite the ten and more Tibetan great ministers, while over a hundred chiefs were seated below the altar. Upon the altar was placed a wooden bench, on which stood the Poch'\u00eap'u, as he recited the sworn treaty, a man standing at his side to translate it for those below. When he had finished, the blood was smeared, but the Poch'\u00eap'u did not smear his lips. After the conclusion of this ceremony, another oath was taken before Fut'u (Buddha), when sumbul water was poured out and drunk. Then they exchanged congratulations with the envoys, and finally descended from the altar.\n\nAs Yuanting was returning home, the Tibetan commander-in-chief, Shang't'\u00eang, entertained him as a guest at Tahaiach'\u00eang(83), where he had assembled over a hundred of the governors and generals of the eastern provinces. He placed the text of the sworn treaty on the terrace, and read it through to them, and besides exhorted each to defend his own border, and not to oppress and plunder his neighbours. On the text was written 7th year of Yit'ai(84).\n\nThe T'ufan despatched a mission, headed by Lunhsinohsi, which accompanied Yuanting to court, to offer thanks. The Emperor appointed envoys to answer this mission.\nThis year Shangch\u2019ihain\u2019rh led troops to attack the Huihu. The lesser minister of the Tanghsiang, Shangaheta, led an army of 3,000 men, who pastured their horses at Mulanliang.\n\nIn the 3rd year (823), the first month, their envoy, Luntaj\u00e9, came to court on a mission of congratulation.\n\nIn the 4th year (824), the 9th month, an envoy came to ask for a picture of Wu\u2019tishan(85). In the 10th month, they sent tribute of yaks, and also a yak, sheep, and deer, of cast silver.\n\nIn the 1st year of Paoli (825), the 3rd month, their envoy, Shangch\u2019ilij\u00e9, came to court, and asked also for a continuance of friendly relations. In the 9th month the Emperor appointed the Director of the Banqueting-court, Li Jui, to go on a mission in reply to the above.\n\nDuring the period T\u2019aiho, from the 5th to the 8th years (831\u2013834), their envoys came to court with tribute, without intermission, and we also always sent missions in answer.\n\nIn the 5th year (831), the general commanding Weichou(86), Hsi\u2019tshemou, offered to surrender the city. The governor-general of Chienan and Haich\u2019uan accepted, took possession of the official seals, weapons, and armour, and despatched a general to occupy it. This chou extended on the south to the Min Mountains in Chiangyang, and on the north to the Lung Mountains; the enemy called it the city of refuge, and it was a most important defence of the southwest. But Min Sengju then ruled the state, and he decided to send back Hsi\u2019tshemou, and resign the city. The T\u2019ufan massacred all the inhabitants, without exception, as a warning to the other barbarians. From this year their envoys came in succession on tributary missions, bringing jade girdles, gold vessels, otter skins, cloth, yak tails, red carpets, horses, sheep, and camels. The tsanp\u2019u, during his reign of about thirty years, was sick and unable to attend to business, and the government was in the hands of the chief ministers; consequently they were unable to rival China, and the frontier guards were left at peace. After his death, his younger brother, Tamo, succeeded to the throne. Tamo was fond of wine, a lover of field sports, and devoted to women, and, besides, cruel, tyrannical, and ungracious, so that the troubles of the state increased.\n\nIn the 1st year of K\u2019ai\u2019ch\u2019eng (836), the 2nd month, missions were sent by both countries.\n\nIn the 4th year (839), the Emperor despatched Li Chingju on a mission to the T\u2019ufan, and they sent Lunch\u2019ij\u00e9 to court with offerings of articles of jade, sheep, and horses. From this time there were earthquakes in their country, the ground opened and water-springs overflowed, the Min Mountain was overthrown, and the T\u2019ao River flowed backwards for three days. Rats ate their corn, and the inhabitants died of hunger and pestilence, so that corpses lay one pillowed on the other. In Shan and K\u2019uo there was heard, after nightfall, the sound of war drums, and the natives were much alarmed.\nIn the 2nd year of Huich'ang (842), the tsanp'u died. In the 12th month their envoy, Luntsanj\u00e9, and suite, arrived with the intelligence of his death, and the Emperor appointed Li Ching to condole and sacrifice.\n\nHe had no sons, and Ch'ililu, a son of Shangyuni, the elder brother of his wife, whose name was Lin, was made tsanp'u. He was only three years old at the time, and the wife was regent of the kingdom. The chief minister Chichtuna, when he had audience of Ch'ililu, refused to do homage, saying: \"There are many collateral descendants of the tsanp'u still living, and why should a son of the family of Lin be appointed?\" and went out weeping. The adherents of the new regime killed him. Another general, Shangk'ungj\u00e9, who was the military governor of Lomench'unan, surnamed Mo, named Nunglij\u00e9, which is equivalent to the Chinese 'lang' (a title of respect), an artful deceiver and fond of intrigue, gained over the three tribes, and got together 10,000 horsemen, with which he attacked Shangpipi, the governor-general of Shanchou, and overran the country as far as Waizhou. He next fought a battle with the minister of state, Shangyussulo, at Pohanshan. The latter was defeated and fled to Sumerhou, where he collected 30,000 warriors of the Sup'i, T'uhun, and Yangt'ung(87), and entrenched his army on the T'ao River. Shangk'ungj\u00e9 issued this proclamation to the Sup'i and the rest: \"The brothers of the ministers have killed the tsanp'u, and the god of heaven has commissioned me to levy righteous soldiers to chastise the wicked. Will you then help traitors who are in rebellion against their country?\" The Sup'i and their allies doubted, and would not fight. Shangk'ungj\u00e9 led some light horse across the river; the various tribes offered their submission, and his united army amounted to 100,000 men. Having captured Shangyussulo, he strangled him.\n\nShangpipi, the governor-general of Shanchou, whose surname was Mulu, and name Tsanhsinya, a native of the Yangt'ung country, was a hereditary noble of the T'ufan. He was a man of liberal mind, and not unversed in literature and history, and was at first unwilling to take office, but the tsanp'u insisted on appointing him. Within three years, the people, in consequence of the illegal election of the tsanp'u, were all in a state of revolt. Shangk'ungj\u00e9 arrogated the title of chief minister, and at the head of 200,000 warriors attacked Shangpipi, with war drums, oxen, horses, and camels, stretching over a thousand li. When he reached Chenhsiehch\u00fcn(88), there was a great storm, with thunder and lightning, and more than ten of his officers were killed by the lightning, together with several hundreds of the sheep, horses, and camels, at which he was alarmed, and halted his troops. When Shangpipi received the intelligence, he sent valuable presents, and despatches, proposing an alliance. Shangk'ungj\u00e9 was greatly rejoiced, and exclaimed: \"Shangpipi is a scholar and knows nothing about war. I will declare myself tsanp'u, and will appoint him my home minister.\" Thereupon he led back his troops, and encamped at Tahsinch'unan. Shangpipi sent two of his generals to attack him. Having hidden 40,000 soldiers in ambush to the south of Hochou, one of the generals, who was posted on the hill, shot down an extremely abusive letter, at which Shangk'ungj\u00e9 was enraged, and came out with his best warriors to fight. The general pretended to be beaten, and they pursued him for some ten miles, until the pursuers fell into the ambuscade, and were attacked.\non all sides. There was a great rain storm at the time, so that the river was much swollen, and a vast number were drowned. Shangk'ungj\u00ea rode away alone and escaped. Having failed in his projects, he became suspicious and tyrannical, and killed many of his officers; two generals surrendered to Shangpipi, and were treated generously.\n\nThe next year he again assaulted Shanchou, the governor-general of which divided his troops into five divisions, and defended it against him, till Shangk'ungj\u00ea took refuge in Tungkuishan, where he fortified himself strongly, and would not come out, until he was surrounded by several lines of stockade, and the road to water cut off. After some ten days he fled to Pohanshan, where he enlisted scattered warriors, and gathered together by degrees a few thousands, with which he fought a battle at Hochishan, and afterwards a second at Nanku, being totally defeated on both occasions. His troops fought each year, and were never disbanded.\n\nIn the spring of the 3rd year of Tachung (849), the minister Shangk'ungj\u00ea, the governor-general of the eastern province, with three chou, Ch'in, Yuan, and Anl\u00ea, and seven fortified passes, including Shibh\u00ean and Muhsia, asked for admission at the frontier. The governor-general of Chingyuan reported this to the Emperor, who appointed the Director of the Imperial Stud, Lu Ch'en, to proceed to welcome him.\n\nShangpipi encamped troops at Hoyuan, and when he heard that Shangk'ungj\u00ea was preparing to cross the Yellow River, he hastened to attack him, but was himself defeated. He defended the bridge at the head of well-armed troops, but was again unsuccessful, and retired after having burned the bridge. Shangk'ungj\u00ea secretly issued from the Chitungling Pass, having crossed by means of a wooden bridge, to attack Shangpipi. At Pat'tuling he defeated one of his generals, Shang'olot'atsang, and afterwards fought a battle at Hsiniuhasa, where he was again victorious. Shangpipi's resources were exhausted, and he led his army to the western borders of Kanchou, leaving T'ophanhaikuang to defend his post, to whom many of Shangk'ungj\u00ea's standard deserted. Shangk'ungj\u00ea invaded deep into the chou of Shan, K'uo, Kua, Su, Yi, and Iisi, plundering and slaughtering wherever he went, till dead bodies were heaped up promiscuously, as in a wolf's lair. His adherents secretly hated him, and all wanted to get rid of him, and they clamoured to invite 500,000 T'ang warriors to unite with them to put down the disturbances. He took refuge in Weichou, and asked for the appointment of tsan'lu, sending offers of submission to the T'ang. The Emperor sent the troops of Chingyuan, Lingwu, Fenghsing, Pinning, and Chenwu, to meet and aid him, and as soon as he arrived despatched the minister Li Chingjang to ask what he wanted. Shangk'ungj\u00ea was haughty and boastful, overestimating himself, and asked to be made governor-general of Ho and Wei, which the Emperor refused. He then returned across the Hsiensyang Bridge, exclaiming: \"I will do great things, and after having crossed this river, will make it the boundary between me and the T'ang.\" Then he again marched to Lomench'uan, and collected scattered soldiers, with the intention of another raid on the frontier.\nBut it rained a long time, till his provisions were exhausted, and he was obliged to flee to K'uechou. Thereupon the governor-general of Fenghsiang reconquered Ch'ingshui; the governor-general of Chingyuan recovered Yuanchou, occupied Shihmen and five other fortified passes, and captured some 10,000 men and cattle; the governor-general of Lingwn took Anliechou, which was made by decree Weichou; the governor-general of Pinning recovered Hsiaokuan and Fenghsiang, and occupied Ch'inchou; and the governor-general of Shannan Heitao gained Fuchou. The Fenghsiang troops fought with the T'ufan at Lungchou, and cut off 500 heads.\n\nIn the 7th month of this year (849), the old men of Ho and Lung led over a thousand of their men and youths up to the palace gate, and the Emperor went to one of the pavilions to review them, at which they all with one accord shouted for joy and applauded. They then loosened each other's hair, and hurried to the shops to buy hats and girdles. The Emperor ordered them to be given good land to dwell in, and the bystanders all said, \"Wan sui\" (Live for ever!).\n\nThe Emperor ordered the soldiers of the four provinces who had distinguished themselves to be rewarded. The fertile ground within the three chou and seven passes was given to the people to cultivate, all taxes being remitted for five years, and revenue officers were sent to the hot springs to establish custom barriers to tax the salt for the support of the borders. The soldiers of the four provinces who understood cultivation of land were given oxen and seed, while the garrisons were allowed double pay and provisions, and relieved every year. Traders and merchants were not to be stopped at the barriers. The soldiers who wished to cultivate the soil were allowed the same privileges as the people.\n\nOriginally, the Emperor T'ai tsung (627-649) conquered Hsieh Jenkou, and acquired the Lungshang territory, captured Li Kuei, and took possession of Liangchou, defeated the T'ukuhun and Kaech'ang, and established the four ch\u00ean. When Yuantsung (713-755) succeeded, he recovered the provinces of Hungho, Chishih and Wanhau, and no watch-fires were lighted in China for nearly thirty years. At Lunt'ai and Yiwu military colonies were established, and corn and pulse were to be seen everywhere. On the K'aiyin Gate there was put a stone with the inscription, \"The road to the farthest west 9,900 li,\" to show to the soldiers that there was no journey of 10,000 li. Since the period Ch'inyman (758-759), Lungya, Chienman and Hsiashan the three chou and seven fortified passes, and some three hundred camps, garrisons and strong places have all been lost. Hsien tsung (806-820) examined the map of the empire, and looked at the ancient boundaries of Ho and Huang, being extremely anxious to recover them, but he had no leisure. The council of state now memorialized that the Emperor having gained fame and territory, his glory should be proclaimed to the world, for, without moving a single soldier or spilling a drop of blood, Ho and Huang had, of their own accord, submitted, and they proposed, therefore, to add to the title of honour of the Son of Heaven. The Emperor replied: \"Hsien tsung thought much about Ho and Huang, but his plans were not perfected when his spirit departed. It is our duty to perpetuate the fame of our ancestors, and do\nyou consult on an addition to the temple names of the two Emperors Shun and Hsien, so that their praise may be lauded by after-generations.\"\n\nThe next year (860) the governor of Shachou, Chang Yich'ao, sent, as an offering to the Emperor, the maps of eleven chou, including Sha, Yi, Su, and Kan. Yich'ao made a secret arrangement with a band of brave and determined men to surrender the city to the T'ang, and on the day fixed they armed themselves, and shouted at the gates of the city, the Chinese all joining them, and the barbarian guards were frightened and fled. He then took command of the city, repaired the armour and weapons, and cultivated the lands, and afterwards fought a series of battles, till all the other cities were taken. He sent in succession ten officers, with staves, inside which they carried despatches, to the north-east, to the city of T'ient\u00ea(89), the military governor of which, Li P'i, reported to the Emperor, who praised the devotion of Yich'ao, and appointed an envoy, the bearer of a decree, to receive his submission and reward him, promoting him to be military governor of Shachou. Soon after it was made the capital of the province of Kueiyi, and he was appointed governor-general.\n\nAfterwards the Tibetan general in command of Ho and Wei, Shangyehsin, on account of the destruction of his country, offered to surrender, and the governor of Ch'inchou, Kao P'ien, received the submission of this general, together with ten thousand tents of the Humo people. Thus these two chou were recovered, and Shangyehsin was appointed a general in the imperial army. After P'ien had recovered this Fenglin fortified pass, he appointed Shangyehsin commander-in-chief of the provincial troops of Ho and Wei.\n\nIn the 2nd year of Hsient'ung (861), Chang Yich'ao brought back Liangchou to submission.\n\nIn the 7th year (866), the Huihu of Peit'ing P'ukuch\u00fcn attacked and took Hsiouchou, and recovered the native tribes.\n\nThe governor of Shanchou, Chang Ch'iyung, fought a battle with Shangk'ungj\u00ea, and defeated him, and sent to the Emperor the war material and armour captured. The remnant of the T'ufan army invaded Pinning, the governor-general of which drove them away. Then P'ukuch\u00fcn fought a great battle with the T'ufan, and cut off the head of Shangk'ungj\u00ea, and sent it to the capital.\n\nIn the 8th year (867), Chang Yich'ao came himself to court, and was appointed a general in the imperial army, and given a residence and land, while the Emperor made a son of his house, Weish\u00ean, governor-general of Kueiyi. He died in the 13th year (872) at Shachou, and the governor, Ts'ao Yichin, took command of the city, and was afterwards appointed governor-general of Kueiyi.\n\nAfterwards there were great troubles throughout China, and the imperial commands were prevented from reaching. Kanchou was annexed by the Huihu, and most of the cities of Kueiyi were lost to the Humo, also called W\u00eanmo, a people who were originally slaves of the T'ufan. It was the Tibetan custom, when they made war, to despatch officers of high rank, accompanied by their slaves and followers, whom they distributed through the conquered districts, to cultivate the land, and pasture herds. During the insurrection of Shangk'ungj\u00ea these were unable to return to their country, and collected together in bands of some thousands, calling themselves Wenmo. They settled within the borders of Kan, Su, Kua, Sha, Ho, Wei, Min, K'uo, T'ieh, and Tang. Those nearest to the Fan capital were the most powerful, and possessed the best horses.\nTHE EARLY HISTORY OF TIBET.\n\nNOTES.\n\n(1) The capital of China during the T'ang Dynasty. It was called by Arabian writers of the period Kundan, supposed by Dr. Edkins to represent the old sound of Chingeh'eng, 'capital.' It is the modern Hsianfu in Shensi.\n\n(2) Ch'iang is the general name of tribes of Tibetan race which have been settled on the west of China from the most ancient times. The character is composed of 'man' and 'sheep,' and is said by an ancient dictionary to be descriptive of their occupation as shepherds.\n\n(3) A short-lived petty dynasty founded in 397, in the vicinity of Liangchou, by a sect of the Tofu tribe or the Hanpu, an eastern Tartar race, the same tribe to which the Emperors of the After Wei Dynasty belonged. The connexion with Tibet would seem to be a myth based only on similarity of sound.\n\n(4) Tsamp'u is generally supposed to be the equivalent of the modern rgyalpo, but it seems rather to be the tsampo in the treaty inscription (see Appendix). Some of the other titles are to be found in Tibetan dictionaries, as: bloa, a magistrate, officer; nangclon, a minister of domestic affairs; chepo is great, and chung small; and nangclon chepo therefore chief minister of domestic affairs, etc.\n\n(5) Se-sa is a kind of precious stone found in the high mountains north-east of Tsanchow.\n\n(6) Lobsieh and Loso are two ways of rendering Lhasa. The stone monument, with the inscription given in the Appendix, erected in 822, still stands in front of the Ta Chao Buddhist temple in the suburbs of the present capital. The position of the Papu Valley is not so definitely fixed; it lay to the south-west of Lhasa on the other side of the Tsang River. An itinerary of the eighth century is given in the Appendix from Shanchou, the modern Hsinngfu, to the Papu Sea or Lake. The name reminds one of Paipu, used in Chinese books on Tibet for Nepal, (Tibetan Ba-pu.)\n\n(7) The yamit is a large kind of sheep, with huge horns, perhaps the Oris Poli.\n\n(8) In the account of an invasion of Yunnan in 799, a high Thibetan officer, Yehstshinchen, an adopted son of the lately deceased sovereign Chi'tsan, is mentioned as surrendering to a Chinese general, when he ought to have been buried with the tsamp'u.\n\n(9) The Yangt'ung first communicated with China in the year 641, when they sent envoys to the imperial court. They were divided into Lesser and Greater. The former people were settled on the plains to the east of Khotan, having the Lesser Yangt'ung on their west, the T'utan on the east. Their country was 1000 li from east to west, and they numbered between 80,000 and 90,000 fighting warriors. They were a nomadic people, who plaited their hair into a queue hanging down behind, and dressed in felt and fur. Wind and snow prevailed, and ice more than ten feet thick. They had no written characters, only cut knothces in sticks and tied knots in cord. The punishments were most severe. When their chiefs died, their skulls were cleft, the brains scooped out, and the space filled with pearls and jade, the abdomen cut open, the viscera removed, and replaced with gold, and finally a false body of gold and much of silver were put in. Men were buried at the same time. Having by divination fixed a propitious day, they buried the body in a cave in some inaccessible place that no one else knew of, and many oxen, sheep, and horses were offered in sacrifice. Mourning was put off as soon as the funeral was over.\n\n(10) The Turks, who conquered the greater part of Central Asia in the sixth century, and established a powerful empire, which was destroyed by the Ongouirs, a people of the same race, in 744.\n\n(11) The Fu'kulan were an Eastern Tartar race, who derived their name from the chief T'uklan, who migrated with 1,000 families towards the south-west, and settled finally in the neighbourhood of Kangch'angfu in Shensi. His descendants extended their rule westwards as far as the borders of Khotan, until their territory measured 3000 li from E. to W., 1000 li from N. to S., extending on the east as far as the modern Hsinngfu. The capital was Fusstch'eng, situated 15 li to the west of the Chi'nghai (Kokonor). Their territory was bounded on the S.W. by the Pailan, which joined the Tanghsiang on the E., the Tomi on the W. They\nwere finally conquered by the T'ufan in the 3rd year of Langso (663), after ruling 250 years, and their sovereign, Nobojo, with his Chinese consort and the remnant of the people, took refuge in China, and were given lands near Lingchou, where Anl-chou was founded, of which he was appointed governor.\n\n(12) The Tangshuang were a people of Tibetan race who first became powerful after the year 584, when the king T'angch and tribe were dispersed by the Chinese. They dwelt in the mountainous country west of the Yellow River and Yenquetu river, being bounded on the N. by the T'ukuhun, on the S. by Ch'\u00fcan tribes called Ch'unamang, Misang, etc., and extending on the E. to Lungchou in modern Shuchuan. They lived on their yaks, horses, asses and sheep, and had no corn, having to borrow barley from their neighbours to make a fermented drink. The son married the wives of his deceased father and uncles, and the brother his sister-in-law, and in such promiscuous connexions they were by far the worst of all barbarians; and yet there was no marriage between persons of the same tribe. Their dead were buried in the earth. They had no written characters, and only arranged rods and pieces of wood to remember the seasons. Once every three years there was a general assembly, at which they sacrificed oxen and sheep to worship heaven. During the Sin dynasty they constantly ravaged the frontier. During the T'ang, from the 3rd year of Chenkuan (629), they gradually became subject, and their tribes were divided into chou and hsien, ruled by their own chiefs, and subject to a governor-general, resident at Sungchou. They were afterwards annexed by the T'ufan. T'opa was the name of the principal tribe, from which were descended the rulers of the Hai Hais or Tangut kingdom, which was established in the fourth century, and destroyed by the hands of Lohmor and Kokonor, till its destruction by Genghis Khan in 1297. Tangut is the Mongolian plural (Tanggod). The name of the modern Mohammedians natives of the same districts, Tungan, comes probably from the same source.\n\n(13) The Pailan, who were called by the T'ufan Tingling, were bounded east by the Tangheshang, west by the Tomi. They could furnish 10,000 brave warriors who were fond of fighting and excelled in war. Their customs were similar to those of the Taungshuang. They submitted to China in 624, and their country was named Weichai and K'ungtung. After they had been conquered by the T'ufan, their warriors were usually placed in the van of the invading armies.\n\n(14) Now Sungpanning in Sutch'nan.\n\n(15) Chung T'enchu, or Central India, also called Mochiat'o (Magadha). The great King Siladitya, who called himself King of Magadha, is mentioned as having sent a mission to the T'ang Emperor after his interviews with the Buddhist monk Yuanchunang, which arrived in 641, in answer to which a Chinese envoy, Li Yipiao, was sent to India. Another mission arrived with offerings of ponies, mares and plaited furs, religious presents, etc. Wang Yuants'e was sent to India, the King of Central India, Siladitya died, and one of his ministers, who had usurped the government, led troops against Yuants'e, who, having only a following of thirty horsemen, fought with them, but their arrows being soon exhausted, they were captured, the foreign troops plundering all the tribute offerings from the other countries. Yuants'e escaped alone in the night, and fled to the T'ufan, who had 1,200 well armed warriors together with over 5,000 Nepali horsemen, to follow Yuants'e. He and the assistant envoy, Chiang Shih'en, led the troops of the two countries and advanced towards the capital of Central India, where they touched on their way, and succeeded, and ordered a great Eastern curtain of 3,000 feet, which some 10,000 men defended in the event the minister was taken, and brought back with them to the imperial capital, where they arrived in 648.\n\nHe has the present in China to erect a new city, frame of military and civil offices and different kinds of animals on each side of the avenue leading to the imperial palace. The statues of the last reigning kings of Kaechang, and of the governors of Kaechang, Magadha, and of the T'ufan, are recorded among other evidences that existed for the same purpose.\n\n(16) The western Khangarang of Xamsa. The T'ufan started from Shanchou; the capital of a province of the Arapans.\n\n(17) The T'ufan's New Seat was at this time occupied by the Black\nTanghriang. It is the upper course of the Chinsa River, which becomes the Yangtsze. The modern name is from the Mongolian ulan, also meaning red.\n\n(19) Pohun was a city 560 li due west of Chintr\u00fc, the modern Kuch\u00ea. The latter from the Han dynasty was the most powerful of the states of Eastern Turkestan. After its conquest by the Chinese in 648, it was made the seat of a governor-general, styled the Anhs\u0131 Tuhufu, who ruled also over Y\u00fctiien (Khotan), Sule (Kashgar), and Suieh, a city on the southern bank of the river of the same name, which runs out of Lake Issikkul on the north of the Celestial Mountains. These four military governments were collectively called the four ch\u00fcn.\n\n(20) A valley on the south of Kokonor.\n\n(21) Wuhs\u0131' (Black Sea) is probably the Kalach'\u0131ih, a lake near the source of the Nukiang.\n\n(22) An ancient city 250 li S.W. of Shanchou, also within the borders of the modern Hsinfu.\n\n(23) Still has the same name, in Ss\u00fceh'uan.\n\n(24) A chou in the south of Ss\u00fceh'uan, now Ningyuanfu.\n\n(25) The country of the Po'olomen (Brahmapa), a synonym of Central India or Magadha.\n\n(26) After the first conquest of the four ch\u00fcn, the governor-generalship of Anhs\u0131 had been moved to Kaoh'ang (Turfan).\n\n(27) A state west of Kaoh'ang, the modern Harashar.\n\n(28) This city, called T'unhung during the Han, was the Kunchou of the T'ang, the modern Anhs\u0131fu.\n\n(29) Yichou is now Hami; Haichou, Turfan; and Peit'ing Urumts\u0131.\n\n(30) These were the ten hordes of the Western Turks, into which Ishih Khan divided his subjects in the year 637. Five formed the left wing, ruled over by five ch'o, and occupied the country to the east of the Suieh River, while the other five, ruled by ssieh'in, were settled on the west of the river. Ch'o and ssieh'in are said to be Turkish titles of officers of high rank.\n\n(31) There is a short account of Nep\u00e1l in the T'ang History which may be quoted here. The kingdom of Nip'olo is situated to the W. of T'ufan. The natives cut their hair in a straight line level with the eyebrows, and wear earrings of bamboo or horn, and think that when they are ornamented when they reach out to the shoulders. They use their hands in eating, have no houses except on chopsticks, and the utensils are all made of copper. There are many merchants among them, few agriculturists. They make copper money, which has the figure of a man on the obverse, a horse and an ox on the reverse, and has no hole in the centre. Their dress is a single piece of stuff wound round the body, and they bathe several times during the day. Their houses are made of wood, the walls all carved and painted. They are fond of games of chance, and delight in trumpet blowing and beating drums. They excel in magic arts, and are clever in astrological calculations. They worship five earth gods, and hang their pictures on stones. Every day they wash these gods with pure water and present offerings of cooked mutton. The King, Naling t\u0131p'o (deva), is covered with a network of strings of pearls, crystal, precious stones, coral and amber, has earrings of gold with jade pendants, and wears a Buddha carved from a precious stone. He sits on a lion throne, and within the hall, flowers and perfumes are scattered. The ministers of state and the courtiers all seat themselves on the ground, and several hundreds of armed soldiers are marshalled near as guards. Within the palace there is a tower of seven stories, roofed with copper tiles, the balustrades and pillars of the pillars and beams all ornamented with precious stones. On each of the four corners of this tower there is suspended a copper pipe which terminates below in a gold dragon spout, and the water from above flows down the pipes and pours out of the mouths of the dragons like so many natural fountains. When the father of Naling deva died, the throne was usurped by an uncle of the rightful claimant, who fled abroad to save his life. The T'ufan gave him refuge, and recovered his kingdom for him, and this was how he became subject to T'ufan. In the period Chenkuan (between 642-647) the envoy Li Yinho, who was sent on a mission to India, passed on his journey through this kingdom, and Naling deva received him\nmost joyfully. He went with him to see the Achipochen pond, which is some twenty paces in circumference, the water of which bubbles up and boils; it neither overflows during the torrents of the rainy season, nor is it diminished when the sun is so hot that the rocks are burning and metal red hot; when anything is thrown in, clouds of smoke rise, and if a vessel of rice be put in, it is soon cooked. Afterwards, when the king Yungch'ih was murdered by the Indians, Nepal, together with India, attacked India, and gained fame.\n\nIn the 2nd year of Yungchih (651) the king, Shih-li-na-lien-to-lo, sent another mission to the imperial court with tribute.\n\n(32) Yaochou was in what is now the province of Yunnan, and was separated from Chinchou by the Chinha Ching, which must be the Yangtze River alluded to, as the Erh Man were aboriginal tribes of Sauch'uan. T'iench'ih is the name of the lake on which Yunnanfu now stands.\n\n(33) K'atun is the Turkish title for the wife of the Khan.\n\n(34) The Tufan built two walled cities, Hangchi and Tancomen.\n\n(35) Ashina Kuch'o'n was Khan of the Turks from 682 to 693, and frequently attacked the borders of China.\n\n(36) Pulu is the modern Balti. At this time it was divided into two states, Greater and Lesser. The Greater Pulu is described in the T'ang History as being due west of T'ufan, contiguous to the Small Pulu, and bounded on the west by the Northern Indian State Wuch'ang (Cidyana). They sent several missions with tribute to China from the year 686, but were finally conquered by the Tibetans. In 747, the Lesser Pulu, under its chief Ch'ihling, overran Balti, from the residence of the T'ufan tsanp'u 3000 li towards the east, and slightly south. Wuch'ang was 800 li W., Greater Pulu 300 li S.E., Koehimi (Kashmir) 500 li S., the Humi city of Solo 500 li N. In the beginning of the reign of Yuantsung, the sovereign Muchinnam came to court. One of his successors was secretly induced by the T'ufan sovereign to take one of his daughters in marriage, and more than twenty states on the north-west submitted to T'ufan, and no longer sent tribute to China. The governor-general of Anhsai sent three expeditions without success, till, in the year 747, the lieutenant-governor, Ho Haimen, was sent with deputies, and Anhsai was taken. He then took the city of Pami, Washch'ti (Uab), and Sul\u00e9 (Kashgar), climbed the Taungling Mountains, and marched through the Pomi (Pamiri) valley to Shighnan, where he divided his forces, and penetrated to Balti by three passes. He cut the bridge over the Soyi River, on which the capital was situated, so as to cut off the T'ufan, who came the next day. The Prince and his Tibetan wife were brought prisoners to the capital, where he was given a purple robe and gold girdle and appointed a general in the guards. The country was called Kungtsch'um and garrisoned with 1000 men. After the first Chinese expedition to Baltistan, Mopri, the chief of Kashmir, sent a mission to ask for troops, saying in his letter: \"From the foundation of our dynasty we have always been subjects of the celestial Khan, and obeyed the commands he has sent. We have in our country three kinds of troops, foot, horse, and elephants. Your servant, in alliance with the sovereign of Central India, has blocked the five great passes from T'ufan, so as to prevent ingress or egress, and has gained victories in battle; and if the celestial Khan will send troops, as he has done to Pulu, we can furnish provisions even for an army of 200,000. There is in our country a dragon lake named Mohopotamo, where we wish to provide an encampment for the imperial troops.\"\n\n(37) Nima Anhsin.\n\n(38) This was a most important fortress 300 li S.W. of Shanchou, and 30 li E. of the Ch'ihling Pass, on the Tibetan road which it commanded. It was founded by the T'ufan, and called \"Iron-sword city,\" taken by the Chinese in the Hsienling period (670-674), but lost afterwards. It was described as surrounded on all sides by precipices, with many knife-like edges, round which the rocky path wound for more than a mile. The difficulties of the siege are related in the account of the modern campaign against the native tribes of the vicinity, when Yo Church'i led 20,000 troops in the year 1724, and took the stronghold by a night assault.\n(39) Ch'ihling, 'The Red Hills,' are 320 li from the modern Hsinchingfu, and form the boundary between the Choros and Khoit Mongolian Ranners. They are described in the T'ungtien as being 30 li W. of the city of Shilp'u, deriving their name from the red colour of the earth and rocks, and as resting on the north on a high range, while on the south they join the Snowy Mountains. During the After Wei Dynasty the Buddhist monk Sungyun, on his way to India, came to Ch'ihling, the boundary of the empire, 1400 li from Loyang. Kansungling is in Sanch'unan, 30 li north of Sungtingling, the T'ang Sungchou.\n\n(40) In Sanch'unan, south-west of Mahchou.\n\n(41) Kolofeng was the sovereign of the Nanchou Man, a branch of the Wu (Black) Man, whence the name of Karjang, applied to their state by Marco Polo, as well as by Mohammedan writers. It was founded in Yunnan, and the capital was called Yangehiuyang, the modern Taiifu. There were at first six chiefs styled chao, but in the period K'aiyuan (718-741) the southern chao absorbed the other five, and divided the kingdom. The Man tribes till then formed extensive states: T'ungtien on the N.W., to Magdulun on the S.W., and to Cochun-Chinchen on the S.E. The father of Kolofeng, who was appointed Prince of Yunnan by the Emperor, fought with the T'ufan, and defeated their army. He died in 748, and his son was appointed by special decree to succeed as Prince of Yunnan. In 752, however, he revolted, and submitted to the T'ufan, who appointed him Tsanp'u chung, with the title of Emperor of the East. Chung is 'younger brother' in the Man tongue.\n\n(42) These were the remnant of a remarkable people of Eastern Tibet who were called the N\u00fc Wang state, from the fact of their being ruled by a woman. They are first mentioned in the Northern History, and are more fully described in the Sui History, after they had sent envoys to the founder of that dynasty in the year 586. It is related: The people in each successive reign make a woman their prince. The surname of the sovereign is Sup'i. They build cities in the mountains with houses of many stories, the sovereign's having nine, in which there are several hundreds of female attendants, and a court is held every five days. The men have nothing to do with the government, only fight and cultivate the land. Both men and women paint their faces and bodies with vermilion, and dress in yellow, and the climate is very cold. The natural products are copper and gold ore, camphor, musk, yaks and two breeds of horses, in addition to salt in abundance, which they carry to India and gain much by the traffic. They have had frequent wars with the T'anghsiang and with India. When the queen dies they collect a large sum of gold money, and select from her family two clever women, of which one is made queen, the other the lesser sovereign. When a person of rank dies, they strip off the skin, and put the bones and flesh mixed with gold powder into a vase, and then bury it; after a year has passed, they put the skin into an iron vessel and bury it. At the end of seven years they take the skin out, and if the crop is good, the birds over, go into the mountains and pray until a bird like a hen pleasant comes and settles on the sorcerer's hand, who cuts open the crop, and if he finds inside grains of corn it will be a fruitful year; if only sand and stones, there will be famine or pestilence. This they call bird divination. During the T'ang they frequently sent tribute. The History describes them under the term Tung (Eastern) N\u00fc state, to distinguish them from a Western people situated somewhere in the Western Ocean, according to Buddhist fable. It also gives the synonym of Subhamatitide (Suvargagota), which means golden family), which occurs only in the New History. They are said to have been sent from Yunnan, where they are thus as a state S. of Kustana (Khotan), E. of Sampaha, W. of Tibet, and wrongly identifies it with the state on the E. of Tibet, which we are discussing (Julien, Voyages de P\u00e9lerins Bouddhistes, vol. ii. p. 232). The boundaries of this were, on the E. Maochou in Sanch'unan and the Tanghsiang, from which it was divided by a high mountain range; on the S.E. was Yachou, separated by the Long Man and the Pailang tribes. From E. to W. was nine days' journey, from S. to N. 20 days. It included over 50 cities, larger and smaller, and the sovereign resides in the K'ungyuen Valley, through which the Te River flows to the S., which they use as currency of ox skins. There are over 40,000 families, 10,000 warriors.

The chiefs were given Chinese titles during the period T'ienpao (742-756), but after the capture of Ch\u00fcnchou they fell under the rule of the T'ufan, returning, however, to their allegiance afterwards. The campaign alluded to is fully described in the record of the Man in the T'ang History, including a curious account of the way the dead body of Ch'\u00fctsang-ch\u00e9h was carried off by his subordinate, the governor-general of Nangkung, named Sulun. He was accompanied by a hundred men, who wept aloud as they went. He detached one man, who stood on the left hand of the corpse, and when one of them asked him: 'Are the wounds painful?' he replied: 'Yes!' and they killed him. Again, 'Will you eat?' and they answered: 'Yes!' and they brought food. 'Will you put on clothes?' 'Yes!' and they called for fur robes. Finally, 'Will you go home?' The same man answered: 'Yes!' whereupon they stretched the dead body on a horse and departed. The Man chiefs were made princes by the Emperor and given seals, robes and girdles, and when they came to have audience later, they were banqueted in the palace and liberally rewarded, and the governors of Lichou and Ch\u00fcnchou were ordered to give to their tribes an annual allowance of salt, clothes and coloured silks.\n\n(56) Kuch\u00fc is near the modern Urumtsi, also called Tihanchou. Anhs\u0131, the modern Kucha, was the chief of the four chen of Eastern Turkestan.\n\n(57) The Shat'o were a separate tribe of the Western T'uch\u00fceh (Turks). They were settled on the south of the Chino Mountains, in the east of the P'ulei lake (Barkul), where there is a great desert called Shat'o, from which they derived their name. After the conquest of Peit'ing the T'ufan removed them to Kanchou, and appointed their chief military commander, styling him chief lun (blon).\n\n(58) The Kolu, also written Kololn, was another Turkish tribe situated north-west of Peit'ing. They are generally known as Karluks.

It is said by some to be the city which was made T'ingchou afterwards changed to Peit'ing; by others to have been 50 li distant from the last, which is recorded in the T'ang History to have been established in this vicinity after the conquest (cf. Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la Chine, tome ii, p. 90).\n\n(61) The Kaoshan, S. of the Yellow River, S.E. of Ninghsiafu.\n\n(62) Yimouhsain succeeded his grandfather Kofofeng in 779. After his succession in alliance with the T'ufan he invaded Seich'unan with a vast army, which marched to Maohou and plundered the country. He was appointed by the T'ufan, Prince of Jihung. He afterwards entered into secret relations with Wei Kao, and in the first month of 794 he sent his son and chief ministers to conclude a sworn treaty with the Chinese envoys who had been despatched to his capital. The ceremony was performed at a temple on the Tsentsang Mountain and four copies were made of the sword text, of which each was kept at the temple, one sunk in the river, one buried in the ground, one in the temple, and the fourth sent to the T'ufan. When the T'ufan were trying to conquer Peit'ing, they fought a great battle with the Huhs\u0131, in which they lost a vast number of killed and wounded, and they sent to demand reinforcements of 10,000 warriors from Yimouhsain, who was wishing to submit to the empire, and took advantage of the occasion to make a large levy of troops, while he alleged weakness to the T'ufan, and declared that he could only furnish 3000, which on further pressure he increased to 5000. He sent these into their country, and followed himself with several myriads, who marched double stages and arrived the next morning on the Iron Bridge (modern Chinchin-tsong, the surferers Bridge of Marco Polo). He then cut the Iron Bridge and thousands were drowned in the river. (The iron bridge, according to the modern descriptions of Yumnan, was 130 li to the north of Chichinchou, where the rocks are carved into holes for the support of the iron chains, and in the winter months when the water is clear iron rings can still be seen at the bottom.) The T'ufan had two military governors in this district, of Shench'unan and of T'iech'iao (Iron Bridge). Five T'ufan princes were taken and a vast quantity of prisoners and booty, and 16\nwalled cities and fortified camps captured. The Emperor sent an embassy to Yi-\nmouhsin with a gold seal inscribed 'Ch'en yuan te' Nanchoa yin' inclosed in a\nsilver box. The envoy was met at the city of Taho by the brother of the Prince,\nwho brought sixty fine horses, all with gold bridles and jade bells, and soldiers\nwere drawn up on each side of the way ringing bells. Yimouhsin had on gold\narmour and a tiger-skin thrown over, and held a bell in each hand; he was sur-\nrounded by a thousand men, armed with long spears, and preceded by twelve large\nelephants, with warriors horse and foot marshalled in rank. He received the seal\nand patents kneeling.\n\n(63) Sungchou is now Sungpinting. Weichou and Paochou within the bounds\nof Weiku'ting in the north of Saich'uan.\n\n(64) Mattingt\u00ea is called in the Nanchao Record by the Chinese title of Kuehhih,\n'State Preceptor,' which is the same title applied to the Buddhist Bhadra when\nhe was invested by Kublai Khan with the rule of Tibet. In the same record it is\nrelated that in the year 890, the destruction of the enemy's army by\ncutting the bank of the Lu River in the night, and fought two battles in succession,\nin which the enemy was defeated and totally dispersed, and that thereupon\nthe K'ang (Samarkand) and Heiyi Tashih (Black-robed Arabs\u2014the Abasides) troops\nwith their Tufan commander all surrendered, and that 20,000 suits of armour\nwere captured. This is interesting as the first mention of Mohammedans in this\nregion. Marco Polo mentions the Saracens in Yunnan, and Rashiduddin says:\n\"And the inhabitants of Yachi are Mohammedans.\" Yachi being the modern\nTalifu, called the city of Yangchungung during the Ming dynasty, near the mouth\nof Nanchao. The Mohammedans of Yachi then revolted against the Chinese in\n1855, and set up a chief who was called Sultan Suleiman.\n\n(65) A city in modern Kanus, west of the Chiaiyikuan in the Great Wall, on\nthe verge of the great desert, near the modern Tunkuanghsien.\n\n(66) The range of mountains N. of Kokonor.\n\n(67) In this year a new Khan of the Ouigours succeeded, who was given the\nChinese title of Teungt\u00ea, and also a sister of the Emperor, Princess T'aiho, in\nmarriage. The new feudal lord, however, was murdered, prepared to kidnap her\nen route, but 20,000 mounted Ouigours arrived as escort.\n\n(68) There is a discrepancy here in the cyclical number of the year, and pro-\nbably the first character is corrupt; a change of this to hein would give hein ch'ou,\nwhich is the cyclical equivalent of A.D. 821. Calculation shows that November\n7th of that year would be the cyclical day kuei yu. Also that the tenth moon\nof that year began or about October 30th. Therefore the day kuei yu\nwould really fall within the tenth moon. Say that this moon commenced on\nOctober 20th, which was the cyclical day chih tzu, then the day kuei yu would be\nexactly the end of the tenth month, as shown above. Against this view, the\n\" Histoire de la Chine\" mentions, under the year 821, in connexion with another\nevent, the full names of the three chief ministers of state, Tsui Chih, Tu Yuan-ying\nand Wang Po, whose second names only, according to custom, are given in the\ntext.\n\n(69) This is the title (Hai hao) of the reigning Emperor who was canonized as\nMutsung, when he would have been given a more grandiloquent sacrificial title.\nThis may be translated 'learned,' 'walks,' 'filial and virtuous Emperor.' It is\nthe same inscribed in the Tibetan version of the treaty (see Appendix).\n\n(70) A rhyming epilogue in eight lines of four syllables.\n\n(71) The bilingual (Tibetan and Chinese) text of this treaty is given in the\nAppendix, from a rubbing obtained from a stone monument erected at the time,\nwhich still stands in front of one of the principal Buddhist temples at Lhasa.\nThe names of the seventeen officials alluded to were also engraved on the northern\nedge of the same stone; eight of whom belonged to the state council, including\nthe commander-in-chief of the forces and the lieutenant-commander.\n\n(72) The Hungechi Bridge crossed the Yellow River on the N.W. of Hoehou,\nwhere there is a city called Hungechi.\n\n(73) See Note 9.\n\n(74) The Itinerary in the Appendix has Lich yi (post-station), the distance of\nwhich from the point where the Yellow River was crossed is there 780 li,\nTHE EARLY HISTORY OF TIBET.\n\n(75) T'ukuhun, see Note 11.\n(76) Now Lanchoufu in Kansu.\n(77) A city 130 li S. of Shanchou (Hainingfu).\n(78) See Note 38.\n(79) See Note 38.\n(80) The Sanpu River, which traverses Tibet from W. to E.\n(81) The Poch'ep'u, called in another place Poch'amp'u, would appear to have been a Buddhist, occupying an important position in the state.

This was the 7th year of the reigning tsanp'u, who succeeded in 816. He is called\nin the New T'ang History, K'olik'otsu, and is said to have reigned under the title (nien-hao) Yit'ai, which means: 'Continuous prosperity.' The Chinese description, quoted just now, says that the inscription is no longer legible. The rubbings were obtained in Peking in 1869, and were said then, from the condition of the paper, to date at least from the last century. The Chinese characters are readily decipherable, with the exception of one portion near the top, where they are completely obliterated, probably by the impact of ladders. This has been filled up from Chinese books, especially the great geography of the empire. The characters so borrowed are distinguished by being written in red. Unfortunately these versions, which all differ from each other, are not exact copies of the original, although they give the sense. They are the source of the two translations already published in Europe by the Jesuit P\u00e8re Amyot, and the Russian Archimandrite Hyacinthe. The Chinese is a translation of the Tibetan original. I have translated mainly from the former, being more familiar with it, and having, moreover, the assistance of a competent native scholar.\n\n\"The learned, warlike, filial, and virtuous Emperor of the Great T'ang, and the divine and all-wise Tsamp'u of the Great Fan(a), two sovereigns allied as father and son-in-law(b), having consulted to unite the gods of the land, and of grain, have concluded a sworn treaty of grand alliance, which shall never be lost nor changed. Gods and men have been called as witnesses, and, in order that all ages and generations may resound in praise, the sworn text, section by section, has been engraved on a stone monument(c).\n\n\"The learned, warlike, filial, and virtuous Emperor, and the divine and all-wise Tsanp'u, T\u00ea-chih-li-tsan(d), their all-wise Majesties, with intuitive wisdom reaching far, and knowing both present and future, good and evil, with feelings of benevolent pity and imperial grace overspreading all, without distinction of native and foreign, have negotiated an alliance, and resolved to give to the myriad families peace and prosperity, and with like thought have completed a long, lasting, good deed. They have re-connected the bonds of affectionate kinship, strengthened anew the right policy of neighbourly friendship, and made this great peace.\n\n\"The two countries, Fan and Han, keeping the lands and boundaries which they now rule: all to the east(e) shall be within the borders of the great T'ang, all to the west shall be the territory of the great Fan. Neither the one nor the other shall slaughter or\nfight, they shall not move weapons or armour, nor shall they plot to encroach on each other's territory.\n\n\"Should any men be liable to suspicion, they shall be taken alive, and their business inquired into, after which they shall be given clothes and food, and sent back to their own country.\n\n\"Now the gods of the land, and of grain, have been united to make this great peace, yet to keep up the good relationship of father and son-in-law, there must be constant communication. The one shall rely on the other, and constantly send envoys to and fro. Both Fan and Han shall change horses at the Chiangch\u00fcn Pass, and to the east of the Suiyung Barrier the great T'ang shall provide for the missions, while to the west of the city of Ch'ingshui(f), the great Fan shall entertain them. They shall both be treated with due ceremony, according to the near relationship of the imperial father and son-in-law, so that within the two borders neither smoke nor dust shall rise, no word of invasion or plunder shall be heard, and there shall be no longer anxious fear and trembling. The frontier guards shall be dismissed, and the land have perfect quiet in consequence of this joyful event.\n\n\"Their grace shall be handed down to ten thousand generations, and sounds of grateful praise shall extend to wherever the sun and moon shine. The Fan shall be at peace in the Fan country, the Han also shall be joyful in the Han country, and this is truly a great deed of good augury. They shall keep their sworn oaths, and there shall never be any change.\n\n\"They have looked up to the three precious ones, to all the holy saints, to the sun, moon, stars, and planets, and begged them to be their witnesses(g). A sworn treaty like this, each one has severally written and exposed, having sacrificed the victims for the sworn ceremony, and ratified this text. Should they not keep these oaths, and either Fan or Han disregard the treaty, and break the sworn agreement, may there come to them misfortune and calamity! Provided only that the work of rebels against the state, or secret plotters, shall not be included as a breach of the sworn ceremony.\n\n\"The Fan and Han sovereigns and ministers(h) have all bowed down and solemnly made oath, and carefully drawn up the written documents. The witnesses of the two sovereigns, the officers who ascended the altar, have reverently written their names below, and the sworn treaty like this has been deposited in the royal treasury.\"\nNOTES TO APPENDIX I.\n\n(a) The beginning of the Tibetan is \u0f56\u0f7c\u0f51\u0f0b\u0f54\u0f7c\u0f0b\u0f46\u0f7c\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f40\u0fb1\u0f72\u0f0b\u0f50\u0f74\u0f56\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f7a\u0f51\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f72\u0f42\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f40\u0fb1\u0f72\u0f0b\u0f64\u0f7a\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f56\u0f0b\u0f5e\u0f72\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f0d. Bod, the equivalent of the Chinese Fan, properly read Po, is still the native name of Tibet, and Rgya the name they apply to China. The title of the great rgyal-po, stean-po, appears to be the equivalent of the Chinese tsean-pu, which is explained to mean champion or hero (Note 1), and is probably corresponding to the Chinese definition as firm and strong. The title of the Chinese Emperor is 'Lord of China, Hang-te' (now Huang-te). The blank space in the original is a sign of respect before the names of sovereigns.\n\n(b) Dbon zhang may mean uncle and nephew, like the Chinese equivalents.\n\n(c) The stone monument called pei in Chinese is a large oblong slab, which is usually erected on the back of a tortoise; it is in Tibetan \u0f62\u0f9f\u0f7c\u0f42\u0f0b\u0f46\u0f7c\u0f66\u0f0b.\n\n(d) The title of the Emperor (see Note 69) is rendered phonetically, not translated, in the Tibetan. The Chinese title of the Tibetan sovereign is unfortunately a blank in the rubbing, and the Tibetan is only partially legible: \u0f56\u0f7c\u0f51\u0f0b\u0f54\u0f7c\u0f0b\u0f46\u0f7c\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f40\u0fb1\u0f72\u0f0b\u0f50\u0f74\u0f56\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f7a\u0f51\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f72\u0f42\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f40\u0fb1\u0f72\u0f0b\u0f64\u0f7a\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f56\u0f0b\u0f5e\u0f72\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f0d.\n\n(e) The versions in Chinese books give here 'to the east of T'ao and Min,' the names of two cities in the south of Kansu, which I have omitted in the translation, as there is no mention of them in the Tibetan text.\n\n(f) Ch'ingshuihsien, in Tibetan \u0f62\u0f9f\u0f7c\u0f42\u0f0b\u0f46\u0f7c\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f40\u0fb1\u0f72\u0f0b\u0f64\u0f7a\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f56\u0f0b\u0f5e\u0f72\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f0d (see Note 49).\n\n(g) This paragraph is interesting as indicating the objects of worship of the Tibetans at this time. The three precious objects of Buddhist faith are Buddha, Dharma (the law), and Sa\u1e45gha (the priesthood); the expression is literally rendered in the Tibetan \u0f62\u0f9f\u0f7c\u0f42\u0f0b\u0f46\u0f7c\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f40\u0fb1\u0f72\u0f0b\u0f64\u0f7a\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f62\u0f56\u0f0b\u0f5e\u0f72\u0f44\u0f0b\u0f0d; \u0f62\u0f9f\u0f7c\u0f42\u0f0b\u0f46\u0f7c\u0f66\u0f0b is defined as a title of honour for male saints, and men of genius and learning.\n\n(h) Sovereign and minister; in Chinese, ch\u00fcn ch'en; in Tibetan, \u0f62\u0f9f\u0f7c\u0f42\u0f0b\u0f46\u0f7c\u0f66\u0f0b.\n\nAPPENDIX II.\n\nItinerary from the T'ang History(1).\n\nFrom Shan-ch'eng-hsien(2), where there is the Ho-yuan-ch\u00fcin (garrison), to Lin-fan-ch'eng ..................

One of the principal routes of the present day to Tibet starts from the same city, and is laid down on the new atlas of the Chinese Empire. It runs S.E. of the Kokonor, crosses the Yelung River, its source, afterwards follows the stream of the river called Murus Usu, next the Sok R. and the Kara Usu affluents of the R. Nu or Salwin, then between the Tengri Lake and Lhasa, S.W., to the Sanpu R., and finally across that river to Shikate (Teshu Lumbo) (cf. Klaproth, Description du Tubet, p. 262). This route would appear to be mainly identical with the above, although the names of the places are all changed, but the whole country is almost completely unknown. The route of Abb\u00e9 Huc to Lhasa, and of Prejevalsky to the Murus Usu, were both to the W. There is no mention of the date of this itinerary; but, from internal evidence, it must have been between 734, when the Chi'ling boundary monument was erected, and 744, when the Prince of Chanch'eng died.\n\n(2) Shanch'enghsien was one of the district cities of Shanchou, situated 120 li to the W. It was founded in 677, and garrisoned with 14,000 troops.\n\n(3) See Note 38.\n\n(4) See Note 39.\n\n(5) The K'upahai was also called Pohai (p. 4), in the T'ukuhun Record Poliang, there being a bridge across.\n\n(6) The general who defeated the T'ufan and reconquered the four chen in 692.\nTHE EARLY HISTORY OF TIBET.\n\n(7) Yi means a post-station.\n(8) Princess' Buddhist temple.\n(9) See Note 11.\n(10) Also written Tangmi, bounded W. by the Sup'i, E. by the Pailan (Note 13).\n(11) Hsiniu means yak. This is the modern Murus Usu.\n(12) The western boundary of the Sup'i state (Note 42). From the cane bridge over the Yak R. to this pass, for 1400 li, the road lay through the territory of this people, who were ruled by female sovereigns and ministers up to the year 742. This name was taken by Khangar for the name of a separate people or state (see Tablaux Historique de l'Asie, Atlas).\n(13) The Hunglukuan would be analogous to the Chinese Hunglussi, the court of state ceremonial, for the entertainment of foreign missions.\n(14) Papu hai (sea or lake) might possibly be applied to a river. The Residence of the tsanp'u is said in another place to be in the Papu ch'uan (valley). The river which runs through the valley in which Teshu Lumbo is situated, and joins the Sanpu near Shikate, is called the Tang R., and one of its affluents Shapu R. A Chinese commentator gets triumphantly over the difficulty by saying that Chashih Lunpu pronounced rapidly would be Papu!\nART. XIX.\u2014Notes on some Inedited Coins, from a Collection made in Persia during the Years 1877\u20141879. By Guy Le Strange, M.R.A.S.\n\nDuring a three years' stay that I made in Persia, while travelling about the country, and living in Tehran, Mehed, Isfahan, and Shiraz, I made a small collection of coins, and passed many pleasant hours in trying to decipher their legends, and reading in Persian histories what I was able to find about the kings and princes whose names occurred thereon. Since I have come home, Mr. Poole, the Keeper of the Coins at the British Museum, has kindly looked over my collection, and, while pointing out what is new, has most courteously given me the benefit of his scholarship in clearing up many difficulties; to his various colleagues in the Medal Room I am also indebted for assistance and instruction.\n\nIt is of course useless mentioning coins already well known by the British Museum and other catalogues. I shall therefore confine myself to those few which I believe to be inedited.\n\nAmong the coins of the Seleucid\u00e6 that are in any way noteworthy, there is a triobolus of Seleucus I., Nicator, on the rev. of which is a drinking or feeding horse, in front of Zeus' feet. A drachm of, I believe, Seleucus III., bears on the exergue of the reverse the letters \u0395\u03a6; but this can hardly refer to Ephesus, for the town was not in Seleucus' hands. On the rev. of a drachm of Antiochus III., Great, are the letters MEN above the head of the seated Apollo.\n\nWhile in Khorasan I obtained three copper coins of Sanabares, a Bactrian king. The name has been read before by Thomas (Num. Chron. 1871, vol. xi. p. 202), as also by M\nSallet (Zeitschr. von Numism. vol. vi. p. 364), as forming its genitive in \u03a3\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2. On my specimens there may be read quite clearly\n\nBACIAEYC CANABAPHC\n\nI do not know whether this has been noted before.\n\nParthian coins were of course very common, especially drachms and the copper pieces, which unfortunately were, as a rule, in too bad a condition to permit of their being read. I never came across any of the large tetradrachms; and though I have some seventy specimens of drachms, I have only one new coin among them; it is apparently of one of Mithradates I.'s satraps; on the obv. is a head to the right (not, as is usual, to the left), bearded, and bound by the tiara; on the rev. is the usual king seated on a stool without a back, and round him is written\n\n\u0392\u0391\u03a3\u0399\u039b\u0395\u03a9\u03a3 \u039c\u0395\u0393\u0391\u039b\u039f\u03a5 \u0391\u03a1\u03a3\u0391\u039a\u039f\u03a5\n\nThe coin resembles one figured in pl. ii. No. 3 of the Parthian Coins, by Mr. Gardner, in the Numismata Orientalia, the new edition.\n\nOn a drachm of Artabanus II., like pl. ii. No. 13 of the above-mentioned work, the inscription runs in my specimen\n\n\u0392\u0391\u03a3\u0399\u039b\u0395\u03a9\u03a3 \u039c\u0395\u0393\u0391\u039b\u039f\u03a5 \u0391\u03a1\u03a3\u0391\u039a\u039f\u03a5 \u0398\u0395\u039f\u03a0\u0391\u03a4\u03a1\u039f\u03a5 \u039d\u0399\u039a\u0391\u03a4\u039f\u03a1\u039f\u03a3\n\nthe usual form being \u0398\u0395\u039f\u03a0\u0391\u03a4\u03a1\u039f\u03a3; but both are barbarous Greek.\n\nI hunted through a great many coins of those ascribed to Orodes I. and Pacorus, but could find none on which the KA\u0399 \u0391\u03a1\u03a3\u0391\u039a\u039f\u03a5 \u03a0\u0391\u039a\u039f\u03a1\u03a5 was clear; for the form of the Greek letters at that time is so barbarous, that almost anything may be read with a little turning and twisting.\n\nSassanian coins are much rarer in Persia than Parthian; and of those that I was able to get, none turned out to be new. The same remark applies to the Ispehbedi coins of Tabaristan, and to the early Pehlevi-Arabic dirhems of my collection. Dinars and dirhems of the Khalifate were of course common, but I found nothing on them that had not\nbeen already noted by Tiesenhausen in his Monnaies des Khalifes Orientaux, except perhaps a much-clipped dinar of Al-Mutawwakel, bearing his name on the reverse area; the date is A.H. 237, and the mint-city is Sana'a\u2014the remarkable point in the coin; for, according to Mr. S. L. Poole, in his Introduction to the Catalogue of Oriental Coins, vol. v. p. xxxv, the Beni Ziyad would seem to have held the lordship of Sans'a as early as 204, or thereabouts. Tiesenhausen makes no mention of any coins struck at Sana'a of about this time.\n\nI have also a rare dinar of the Beni Aghlab of the year 296.\n\nThe obverse area has \u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647, etc., as usual; on the obverse margin is \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0631\u0633\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0631\u0633\u0644\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0647\u062f\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062e, with the curious tail to the \u064a of \u064a\u0627\u0644\u0647\u062f\u0649 which is characteristic of the coins of this dynasty; the reverse area has:\n\n\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0631\u0633\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\n\n\u2014Ja'afar.\n\nand the marginal inscription is:\n\n\u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0646\u0631\u0628 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u0633\u062a \u0648 \u062a\u0633\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0645\u0627\u0626\u062a\u064a\u0646\n\nwith no mint-city, as is usual.\n\nNow as the power of Beni Aghlab fell in Rajab, 296, this must have been one of the last of their dinars\u2014who the Ja'afar is I am unable to find out. I bought this coin in Tehran; and though the obverse is much rubbed, there seems to be no doubt of its genuineness.\n\nThe gem, however, of my collection is a dinar of Al Hasan ben Al Kasem the Alide, who in Weil's Gesch. der Chalifen, vol. ii. p. 614, is mentioned as having held rule at Amol in Tabaristan. I believe none of his coins have been published before.\n\nThe date is A.H. 306; the weight 59\u00b75grs, and size 4 of Mionnet's scale. On the obverse area is:\n\n\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647, etc.\n\n\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0639\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0642\nOuter margin:\n\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u064a\u0631\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0644\u064a\u062f \u0647\u0628 \u0639\u0646\u0643\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062c\u0633 \u0627\u0647\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u062a \u0648\u064a\u0637\u0647\u0631\u0643\u0645 \u062a\u0637\u0647\u064a\u0631\u0627\n\"For God only desireth to put away filthiness from you, as his household, and with cleansing to cleanse you.\"\u2014Koran, xxxiii. 33.\n\nInner margin:\n\u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0636\u0631\u0628 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0627\u0631 \u0628\u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u0627\u0645\u0644 \u0633\u0646\u0647 \u0633\u062a \u0648\u062a\u0633\u0639\u064a\u0646\nReverse area:\n\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0631\u0633\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0633\u0646 \u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0633\u0645\nReverse margin:\n\u0627\u0630\u0646 \u0644\u0644\u0630\u064a\u0646 \u064a\u0642\u0627\u062a\u0644\u0648\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0633\u0645\u0647\u0645 \u0638\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0627 \u0648\u0625\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0646\u0635\u0631\u0647\u0645 \u0644\u0642\u062f\u064a\u0631\n\"A sanction is given to those who\u2014because they have suffered outrages\u2014have taken up arms, and verily God is well able to succour them.\"\u2014Koran, xxii. 40. Rodwell.\n\nAmol, though not, I believe, unknown as a mint-city, is of exceedingly rare occurrence. The verse from the Koran xxxiii. 33, is found again on the coins of the Hasani Sherifs of Morocco of the tenth century, but without the last three words, i.e. stopping with the word \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u062a. The verse on the reverse margin I have been able to find on no other coins; it would hardly have been taken by any one not in rebellion against the authority of the Khalifeh. This Al Hasan was surnamed Al Dai al Saghir (see Weil, loc. cit. note 3). On his coins, however, he takes the title of his predecessor\u2014Al Da'i ila 'l Hakk.\n\nIn the J. R. A. S. 1875, p. 252, Mr. S. L. Poole has described a dinar having the mint-city 'Ani. While in Tehran I bought a dinar which turns out to be a well-executed forgery purporting to be struck at that city. It is extremely well made, but weighs only 42-5 grs. It is dated 314 A.H. On its obverse and reverse areas is written:\n\n\u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0628\u0627\u0633 \u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u062a\u062f\u0631 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0645\u0646\u064a\u0646\n\n1 The pronoun is here in the pl. masc., whereas the plur. fem. is used in the previous part of the verse. The partisans of Ali quote this passage to prove the intimate union of Ali and his posterity with the Prophet.\u2014Rodwell's Koran.\n2 See Cat. Or. Coins in Brit. Mus., 1890, vol. v. p. 88.\nwho afterwards succeeded as Ar-Radi billah. I cannot help thinking that although the coin is a forgery, yet that it presupposes a real coin somewhere from which it was copied. The workmanship is extremely good\u2014so good as to deceive at first sight the experienced judges of the British Museum. May it not be a counterfeit of the time?\n\nThree dinars of Nuh ibn Nasr, the Samanide Amir, I think deserve mention; they are all from the same mint-city\u2014Nishapur; their dates are 331, 333, 337. The first of A.H. 331 has the usual obverse\u2014viz. the Ist symbol, date on inner margin and the verse from the Koran, cxxx. 3, on outer. The reverse area has:\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0631\u0633\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0643\u0641\u064a \u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0646\u0648\u062d \u0628\u0646 \u0646\u0635\u0631\n\nthe Nasr being spelt with a \u0633 instead of a \u0635. The reverse margin is the usual IIInd symbol. It has every appearance of being genuine.\n\nThe second dinar of A.H. 333 has a similar obverse, except for the difference in date; its reverse area has:\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0631\u0633\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0643\u0641\u064a \u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0646\u0648\u062d \u0628\u0646 \u0646\u0635\u0631\n\nwith a very clearly-written \u0639 in the Nasr. The marginal inscription is the usual IIInd symbol divided from the area by a single line.\n\nNext we come to the dinar of A.H. 337, with obverse as on the two former coins; the reverse also exactly like the dinar of A.H. 333 bears the Khalifeh Al Mustakfi's name, though he had been deposed in A.H. 334 by the Buyehs. It differs from the dinar of A.H. 333 in this, that its reverse area is separated from its marginal legend (the IIInd symbol) by a double instead of a single line.\n\nAnd lastly is a beautiful dinar of Majd ad Dauleh Buyeh of the year A.H. 398. On the obverse and reverse the marginal inscriptions are contained within hexagonal lines; the mint-city is Muhammadiyeh; on the obverse area is the\nname of the Khalifeh Alkader billah; on the reverse area are Majd ad Dauleh's titles after the usual\u2014\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\n\u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0631\u0633\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647\n\nthus:\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064a\u062f \u0634\u0627\u0647\u0627\u0646\u0634\u0627\u0647 \u0645\u062c\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u0629 \u0648\u0643\u0641\u0627\u0644\u0629 \u0628\u0646 \u0641\u062e\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u0629 \u0628\u0648\u0628\u0647\n\nThe dinar is in very fine preservation, and all the letters may be easily made out.\n\nBefore closing these notes I may mention that I bought in Shiraz a dirhem of A.H. 131, coined at Ash-Shamiyeh, exactly similar to the one in Poole's Brit. Mus. Cat. of Eastern Khalifehs, vol. i. p. 22. Ash-Shamiyeh would seem to have had a mint for but a single year.\nART. XX.\u2014Buddhist Nirv\u0101na, and the Noble Eightfold Path.\n\nBy Oscar Frankfurter, Ph.D.\n\nThe following three P\u0101li suttas strictly bear on the much-disputed question of the Buddhist Nirv\u0101na, and I trust they will, as far as Southern Buddhism is concerned, help to finally settle the question.\n\nThe suttas are taken from the Samyutta Nik\u0101ya, and form respectively the 4th, 5th, and 9th part of the Sal\u0101yatana-vaggo, which itself forms the fourth part of the Samyutta Nik\u0101ya. The suttas are called respectively Jambukh\u0101daka-samyuttam, Samandakasamyuttam, and Asa\u1e45khatasamyuttam.\n\nThe text is chiefly based on the Phayre manuscript of the India Office Library (Ph.). Besides this I used a MS. written in Sinhalese characters, belonging to Th. Satchell, Esq., of Hampstead (S.), which breaks up at the end of the first chapter of the Asa\u1e45khatasamyuttam; and a MS. of the Asa\u1e45khatasamyuttam on paper (D.), written in Sinhalese characters, copied for T. W. Rhys Davids, Esq., by Deva Aranolis, from an old MS. belonging to Dadalla Vihare, near Galle, now in possession of the British Museum (Or. 2261), to which it came with the other MSS. belonging to the late Professor Childers.\n\nThe Jambukh\u0101dakasamyuttam as well as the Samandaka-samyuttam relate conversations which respectively the paribb\u0101jaka Jambukh\u0101daka (one who feeds on rose-apples) and Samandaka held with Gotama's famous contemporary S\u0101riputta. The Asa\u1e45khatasamyuttam is a sermon preached by Gotama himself on Nirv\u0101na.\n\n1 See Westergaard, Cat. 276. In the enumeration of the suttas of this part, W. omits the Samandakasamyuttam and the Mogallanasamyuttam, which both immediately follow the Jambukh\u0101dakasamyuttam.\nIt may be remarked that the usual beginning, \"evam me sutam,\" \"thus I have heard,\" is wanting in all three suttas,\u2014that the Asankhatasamyuttam has no introduction whatever. The words \"evam me sutam\" seem to occur, as far as I could see, in the whole of the Samyutta Nikaya only where something more or less fabulous is related.\n\nThus, for example, in the Maraasamyuttam, which relates Gotama's encounter with Mara and his daughters, and the final retreat of Mara; in the Valabhakasamyuttam, which treats in a somewhat ironical manner on the changes of the weather; in the Moggallanasamyuttam, which treats on the supernatural powers attained by Moggallana.\n\nTo give a translation of the three suttas is superfluous: the technical difficulties remain the same if rendered into English, so I prefer to give only an abstract of each of the three Suttas, and then conclude with a few notes on the text.\n\n1) Jambukhadakasamyuttam.\n\nOnce upon a time the venerable S\u0101riputta lived in the village of N\u0101laka, in Magadhi. Then the paribbajaka Jambhukhadaka went to the venerable S\u0101riputta, and having approached him, he greeted friendlylly the venerable S\u0101riputta, and having exchanged with him the compliments of friendship and civility, he seated himself near him. And having seated himself near him, the paribbajaka Jambhukhadaka thus addressed the venerable S\u0101riputta (\u00a7 1):\n\n\"There is a thing called Nirv\u0101na, S\u0101riputta. What then is, Sir, Nirv\u0101na?\"\n\n\"'The cessation of lust, anger, and ignorance; this is called Nirv\u0101na. There is further a path\u2014there is a way to the realization of Nirv\u0101na.'\"\n\n\"There is indeed, Sir, a path, there is indeed a way to the realization of Nirv\u0101na. Which then is the path, which then is the step to the realization of Nirv\u0101na?\"\n\n\"'That is indeed, Sir, the Noble Eightfold Path for the realization of Nirv\u0101na, viz. right views, right aims, right speech, right conduct, right livelihood, right keeping in\nmind, right meditation; that is indeed the path and the way to the realization of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood is the path, good is the way for the realization of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a, adequate for zeal\u201d (\u00a7 2).\n\nThe answer to the question what Arhatship means, and the way and path how to attain it, is the same as that contained in answer to the question about Nirv\u0101\u1e47a (\u00a7 3).\n\nThe next question is, who are the orthodox among the people, who are the righteous among the people, and who are the happy among the people.\n\nS\u0101riputta answers: Those who having forsaken lust preach the law, who having forsaken anger preach the law, who having forsaken ignorance preach the law, are the orthodox among the people.\n\nThose who walk about, after having forsaken lust and anger and ignorance, are the righteous among the people.\n\nThose by whom lust, anger, and ignorance has been abandoned, has been rooted out, has been destroyed, has been annihilated, so that it will never rise up again, are the happy among the people.\n\nThe answer to the question, how to get rid of lust, anger, and ignorance, is, as always, the Noble Eightfold Path (\u00a7 4).\n\nIn \u00a7 5 we have the question, for what purpose do they lead a religious life under the ascetic Gotama, and he answers, for the sake of acquiring the knowledge of suffering. To perceive this knowledge S\u0101riputta names again the Noble Eightfold Path.\n\nIn \u00a7 6, in answer to the question in how many ways can one attain comfort, S\u0101riputta says that a bhikkhu may attain comfort when he has correctly perceived the origin, the cessation, the feeling, the danger, and untrustworthiness of the organs and objects of sense.\n\nIn \u00a7 7 S\u0101riputta says the highest comfort is obtained when, after having perceived the origin, etc., of the organs and objects of sense, the bhikkhu is immediately made free.\n\nFrom \u00a7\u00a7 8 to 16 we have then an enumeration of different things, which by the Buddhistic philosophy are considered as\nevils, to get rid of which S\u0101riputta again recommends the Noble Eightfold Path.\n\nThese are\u2014\n\n\u00a7 8. The Three Sensations.\n\u00a7 9. The Three Sins.\n\u00a7 10. Ignorance.\n\u00a7 11. The Three Cravings.\n\u00a7 12. The Four Streams.\n\u00a7 13. The Four Attachments.\n\u00a7 14. Existence in its Three Forms.\n\u00a7 15. Suffering.\n\u00a7 16. The Elements of Being.\n\n\u201cHow now, S\u0101riputta! What is difficult in this doctrine and discipline?\u201d\n\n\u201cGiving up the world, indeed, Sir, is difficult in this doctrine and discipline.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is difficult for him who has given up the world?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor him who has given up the world, the delighting in that state is difficult.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor one who so delights, what, Sir, is difficult?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor one who delights, Sir, the performance of greater and lesser laws is difficult.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes it take long, Sir, for him who fulfils the greater and lesser duties, for a bhikkhu to become an Arhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot long, Sir\u201d (\u00a7 17).\n\n2) SAMANDAKASA\u1e42YUTT\u0100M.\n\nOnce upon a time the venerable S\u0101riputta lived in Ukkavali, on the borders of the Gang\u0101 river, among the Vajjians. Then the paribb\u0101jaka Saman\u1e0daka went to the venerable S\u0101riputta, and having approached, he friendly greeted the venerable S\u0101riputta, and having exchanged with him the compliments of friendship and civility, he seated himself near him. And having seated himself near him, the paribb\u0101jaka Saman\u1e0daka thus addressed the venerable S\u0101riputta.\n\nThen follow \u00a7 2 and \u00a7 17 of the Jambukhadakasa\u1e43yutt\u0101m. Instead of a table of contents, it says: \u201cThe contents similar to the preceding.\u201d\n3) ASANKHATASA\u1e42YUTTA\u1e42.\n\n\"Nirv\u0101na I teach you, bhikkhus! and the way which leads to Nirv\u0101na. Listen. What, bhikkhus, is Nirv\u0101na?\n\n\"The cessation of lust, anger, and ignorance; that is called, bhikkhus, Nirv\u0101na (\u00a7 1).\n\n\"What is the way which leads to Nirv\u0101na?\n\n\"The meditation on the body; that is called, bhikkhus, the way which leads to Nirv\u0101na (\u00a7 2).\n\n\"Thus was preached by me Nirv\u0101na, thus the way which leads to Nirv\u0101na, which ought to be accomplished by the teacher, which has been accomplished by him, who seeks after the good of the disciples, who being pitiful, is full of pity\u2014that to you by me. Rejoice, O bhikkhus, in this forest life, in solitude; give not up, give yourself no cause for repentance\u2014thus is our teaching to you\" (\u00a7 3).\n\nThe identical answer to what is Nirv\u0101na occurs over and over again in the sutta, and as ways and means he gives the following series of answers:\n\n\u00a7 5. Tranquillity and Spiritual Insight.\n\u00a7\u00a7 8, 9. The Two Sets of Self-concentration.\n\u00a7 10. The Four Earnest Meditations.\n\u00a7 11. The Four Right Exertions.\n\u00a7 12. The Four Paths to Iddhi.\n\u00a7 13. The Five Senses.\n\u00a7 14. The Five Powers.\n\u00a7 15. The Seven Constituents of Wisdom.\n\u00a7 16. The Noble Eightfold Path.\n\nIn the second chapter the full text of the way how to attain Nirv\u0101na is given, and the whole concludes with an enumeration of different expressions for Nirv\u0101na.\n\nThe answer given by S\u0101riputta, as well as the sermon preached by Gotama in these suttas on Nirv\u0101na, fully bears out the opinion of Mr. T. W. Rhys Davids, expressed in his valuable little book on Buddhism, viz. that Nirv\u0101na is to be attained in this life.\n\np. 111: \"What, then, is Nirv\u0101na? It is the extinction of that sinful, grasping condition of mind and heart, which would\notherwise, according to the great mystery of karma, be the cause of renewed individual existence. That extinction is to be brought about by, and runs parallel with, the growth of the opposite condition of mind and heart; and it is complete when that opposite condition is reached.\n\n\"Nirv\u0101na is therefore the same thing as a sinless, calm state of mind, and if translated at all, may best, perhaps, be rendered 'holiness'\u2014holiness, that is, in the Buddhist sense\u2014perfect peace, goodness, and wisdom.\"\n\nAnd further, p. 115: \"It follows, I think, that to the mind of the composer of the Buddhavamsa, Nirv\u0101na meant not the extinction, the negation of being, but the extinction, the absence, of the three fires of passion.\"\u00b9\n\nThat is, as Gotama expresses it, the cessation of lust, anger, and ignorance. R\u0101go, doso, and moho are enumerated in the Sangitisutta of the D\u012bgha Nik\u0101ya as the three fires (aggi) and the three obstacles (ki\u00f1cana). The commentary Sumangala Vil\u0101sin\u012b explains ki\u00f1cana by palibodho, that is, obstacle to religious perfection (Childers' Dict., p. 205).\n\nIt is interesting to notice that this view of Nirv\u0101na as laid down in these Suttas in the Pi\u1e6dakas still occurs also in the commentaries written in Ceylon as late as the fifth century.\n\nThus the Commentator on the J\u0101takas says (Fausb\u00f6ll, p. 61):\n\n\"'By what can every heart attain to lasting happiness and peace?'\n\n\"And to him whose heart was estranged from sin the answer came, 'When the fire of lust is gone out, then peace (Nibbuta) is gained; when the fires of hatred and ignorance are gone out, then peace is gained; when the troubles of mind arising from pride, credulity, and all other sins have ceased, then peace is gained! Sweet is the lesson this singer makes me hear, for the Nirv\u0101na of Peace (Nibb\u0101nam) is that which I have been trying to find out. This very day I will break away from household cares. I will renounce the world! I will follow only after the Nirv\u0101na itself.'\"\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 These italics are mine.\n\u00b2 The translation is taken from Rhys Davids's 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' p. 80.\nNotes.\n\nAs we have to refer frequently to the Sangitisutta and to the Dasuttarasutta, it may be as well to give here a description of them.\n\nThese suttas are the last two of the Digha Nik\u0101ya. After an introduction, which has nothing whatever to do with the main object of the sutta, S\u0101riputta gives, at the request of Gotama, a recital (Sangiti) of the laws (dhamm\u0101) preached by the Blessed One, full of wisdom, etc., out of compassion for the world, for the benefit of gods and men.\n\nAthi kho \u0101vuso tena Bhagavat\u0101 j\u0101nat\u0101 passat\u0101 arahata samma\u1e41sambuddhena (1\u201310) dhamm\u0101 sammadakkh\u0101t\u0101 tattha sabbeheva sa\u1e45g\u0101yitabbam na vivaditabbam yathayida\u1e41 brahmacariyam addhaniyam assa ciratthhinikam tadassu bahujanahit\u0101ya bahujanasukh\u0101ya lok\u0101nukampak\u0101ya ath\u0101ya hit\u0101ya sukhiy\u0101 devamanuss\u0101n\u0101\u1e41.\n\nThe Dasuttara-sutta is likewise delivered by S\u0101riputta: for the attainment of Nirv\u0101na, for putting an end to suffering, for the release from all bonds.\n\nDasuttaram pavakkh\u0101mi dhamma\u1e41 nibb\u0101na-pattiy\u0101, dukkhass' anta kiriy\u0101ya, sabbagandhappamocan\u0101\u1e41.\n\nHe gives ten laws, which he calls respectively\u2014\n\nbahuk\u0101ro causing much.\nbh\u0101vetabbo to be increased.\npari\u00f1\u00f1eyyo to be learnt.\npah\u0101tabbo to be avoided.\nh\u0101nabh\u0101giyo conducive to abandonment.\nvisesabh\u0101giyo conducive to superiority.\nduppa\u1e6di vidho difficult to comprehend.\nupp\u0101detabbo to be accomplished.\nabhi\u00f1\u00f1eyyo to be known.\nsacchikatabbo to be realized.\n\nOf these ten, the commentary gives the following explanations:\n\nbahuk\u0101ro ti bah\u016bpakaro.\nbh\u0101vetabbo ti va\u1e0d\u1e0dhetabbo.\npari\u00f1\u00f1eyyo ti t\u012bhi pari\u00f1\u00f1\u0101hi pari\u00f1\u0101nitabbo.\npah\u0101tabbo ti pah\u0101n\u0101nupassan\u0101ya pah\u0101hitabbo.\nhanabh\u0101giyo ti ap\u0101yag\u0101mi pari\u00f1\u0101n\u0101ya sa\u1e41vattanako.\nvisesabh\u0101giyo ti visesag\u0101mi vises\u0101ya sa\u1e41vattanako.\nduppa\u1e6di viddho ti duppaccakkhakaro.\nupp\u0101detabbo ti nippha\u1e0detabbo.\nabhi\u00f1\u00f1eyyo ti n\u0101tapari\u00f1\u00f1\u0101ya abhi\u00f1\u0101nitabbo.\nsacchik\u0101tabbo ti paccakkha\u1e41 k\u0101tabbo.\n\nS\u0101riputta's answer to the question, in which way and by what means Arhatship and Nirv\u0101\u1e47a are to be attained, is, by the Noble Eightfold Path.\n\nIn Sa\u1e45g\u012bti Sutta the eight divisions of the Path are enumerated under the heading of the eight good practices (sammatt\u0101), in opposition to the eight micchatt\u0101 (wrong practices); and in the Dasuttara Sutta they are referred to under the heading of the dhamm\u0101 bh\u0101vetabb\u0101.\n\nIn quoting the Sangiti Sutta and the Dasuttara Sutta, I use the abbreviation San. S. for Sangiti Sutta, and Das. S. for Dasuttara Sutta.\n\nIn the Mah\u0101satipat\u1e6dh\u0101nasutta of the Digha Nik\u0101ya\u2014the Satipat\u1e6dh\u0101nasutta of the Majjhimanik\u0101ya (see R. Morris, in his forthcoming book on the \"Seven Jewels of the Law,\" to whom I am indebted for this reference), we find the following explanation of the Noble Eightfold Path:\n\n1) Samm\u0101di\u1e6d\u1e6dhi, right views. These right views concern suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path to the cessation of suffering. They constitute the four great truths of Buddhism, and are enumerated in the San. S. under the heading of the four \u00f1\u0101\u1e47as, and in the Das. S. under the heading of the four dhamma abhi\u00f1\u00f1eyy\u0101.\n\n2) Samm\u0101sankappo, right aims: the aim of renouncing\n\n---\n\n1 Katam\u0101ca sammaditthi bhikkhave?\nDukkha-\u00f1\u0101nam, dukkha-samudaya-\u00f1\u0101nam, dukkha-nirodha-\u00f1\u0101nam, dukkha-nirodhasa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101ya patipado-\u00f1\u0101nam. Ryan kho bhikkhave sammaditthi vocati.\n\n2 It is perhaps worth attention that in answer to the question, katame catatt\u0101 dhamm\u0101 appaide\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101, the Das. S. has catatt\u0101 \u00f1\u0101\u1e47\u0101ni. These are, however, dhamme \u00f1\u0101\u1e47\u0101ni, anvaye \u00f1\u0101\u1e47\u0101ni, parirrochede \u00f1\u0101\u1e47\u0101ni, samuttiya \u00f1\u0101\u1e47\u0101ni. The comm. explains the first as knowledge of the four paths, the second as knowledge of the four truths, the third as knowledge of the nature of the heart of others, the fourth as general knowledge.\nthe world, aims free from malice, aims free from cruelty. They are enumerated in the San. S. under the heading of the kusala-sankapp\u0101.\n\n3) Samm\u0101vaca, right speech: viz. to abstain from lying, slander, harsh language, frivolous language.\n\nThese constitute the ariya voh\u0101ra of the San. S.\n\n4) Samm\u0101kammanto, right conduct: viz. to abstain from destroying life, from taking what is not given, and adultery.\n\nI do not find an enumeration of these details either in the San. S. or in the Das. S.\n\n5) Samm\u0101 \u0101jivo, right livelihood: who, having forsaken a wrong livelihood, leads a thoroughly good life.\n\n6) Samm\u0101 v\u0101y\u0101mo, right exertion. These exertions are (1) to prevent sinful conditions arising, (2) to put away sinful states already existing, (3) to produce meritorious states not yet in existence, and (4) to retain meritorious states already in existence.\n\nIn the Sangit\u012b Sutta these exertions are enumerated under the heading of the four sammappadh\u0101n\u0101.\n\n7) Samm\u0101 sati, right keeping in mind: keeping in mind the impurity of the body, the evils of the sensations, the evanescence of thought, the conditions of existence.\n\nIn the San. S. these satis are enumerated under the heading of the four satipatth\u0101nas, and in the Das. S. they are referred to under the heading of the four dhamm\u0101 bh\u0101vetabb\u0101.\n\n---\n\n1 Katamo ca samm\u0101sankappo? nekkhammasa\u1e45kappo, avijjhassankaappo, avihimmasankaappo.

According to the Satipatth\u0101nasutta they are the four stages of Jh\u0101na meditation, through which gradually the believer's mind is purged from all earthly emotions. In the San. S. they are referred to under the heading of the four jh\u0101na (cf. Rhys Davids' \"Buddhism,\" p. 175).\n\nThus far the Eightfold Path.\n\nIt seems expedient to settle first the question about the means to attain Nirv\u0101na. The author of the Asa\u1e45khata-samyuttan follows a numerical order in answering the question by what ways and means Nirv\u0101na is to be attained. He begins with one law, then two, three, four, five, seven, and eight. Therewith he concludes the first chapter, which in the Burmese copy ends with \"Nibb\u0101nasamyuttasa pathamo vaggo,\" whilst the Sinhalese copies only have pathamo vaggo.\n\nIn the second chapter we have the full text of the laws referred to in the first chapter.\n\nK\u0101yagat\u0101sati. This is the dhammo bh\u0101vetabbo of the Das. S. It has, according to the commentary Sumangala Vil\u0101sin\u012b, where a lengthy description is given, the same meaning as kayaupassana, and is thus the first of the satipatth\u0101nas.\n\nSamatho ca vipassan\u0101ca, and the three Sam\u0101dhi, are respectively the two and three dhamm\u0101 bh\u0101vetabb\u0101 of the Das. S. They are likewise enumerated in the San. S.\n\nIn the same way the four Satipatth\u0101nas, the seven bojjhangas, and the ariyo attha\u1e45giko maggo are enumerated under the heading of the dhamm\u0101 bh\u0101vetabb\u0101.\n\nThe full text of the seven bojjhangas, as we have it in the second chapter, agrees with the bh\u0101van\u0101padh\u0101nam of the San. S.\n\n1 Katam\u0101ca bhikkhave samm\u0101sam\u0101dhi?

S.\n\nOf the samm\u0101ppadh\u0101nas we have the full text in the second chapter, and it will easily be seen that this is the same text as that of the samm\u0101v\u0101y\u0101mo of the Eightfold Path.\n\nThe text of the idhip\u0101das agrees likewise with that given in the San. S.\n\nThe five indriyas and the five balas consist of the same details, and differ only in name.\u00b9\n\nIn the enumeration of the Noble Eightfold Path D. omits the samm\u0101v\u0101y\u0101mo and samm\u0101sam\u0101dhi. That is most probably a mere blunder of the copyist, though we have the full text of the samm\u0101v\u0101yamo in the enumeration of the samm\u0101ppadh\u0101nas.\n\nThe end of the Asankhatasa\u00f1nyuttan forms an enumeration of different expressions for Nirv\u0101na.\n\nPh. repeats after every new word the first question with pe. D., without repeating the question, puts pe after tam sun\u0101tha. The meaning of both these \u2018pe\u2019 seems to be the same, viz. that the series of answers given in the first part ought to be understood after every one of the following.\n\nThe words given for Nirv\u0101na occur for the most part in the Abhidh\u0101nappadipik\u0101. I annex a list of those which do not occur in the Abh., as well as those of the Abh. which do not occur in our sutta.\n\nD\u2019Alwis, in his Buddhist Nirv\u0101na, has tried to etymologize these words in favour of his theory of annihilation. With what result every one knows.\n\nNot in the Asankhatasa\u00f1nyuttan are: mokkho, nirodho, ar\u016bpa\u1e41, akata\u1e41, apalokita\u1e41, akkhara\u1e41, dukkhakkhayo, vivatta\u1e41, kevalam, apavaggo, accutam, padam, yogakkhemo, santi, visuddhi, vimutti, asankhatadha\u1e6du, nibbutti.\n\nNot in the Abhidh\u0101nappadipik\u0101 are: ajjara\u1e41, apaloka\u1e41, nipp\u0101pa\u1e41, acchariya\u1e41, abbhuta\u1e41, anitikadhammo.\n\n\u00b9 Rhys Davids, Book of the Great Decease, 62.\nWe have now to regard the remaining portions of the Jambhukh\u0101dakasamayuttam. Not having had at my disposal a commentary, it is scarcely possible for me to give another explanation than that furnished by the text.\n\nThe first three paragraphs have been amply discussed in the preceding pages.\n\nFrom \u00a7\u00a7 8 to 16 we have an enumeration of different things regarded as evils, to get rid of which S\u0101riputta recommends the Noble Eightfold Path.\n\nThe three vedanas mentioned in \u00a7 8 are referred to in the Das. S. as the three dhamm\u0101 pari\u00f1\u00f1eyy\u0101. They are the same as those of the San. S.\n\n\u00a7 9 enumerates three \u0101sava, viz. k\u0101ma, bhava, avijja. That is in strict accordance with the San. S. The Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101nasutta, as well as Hardy (Manual) and Rhys Davids (Buddhism, p. 120), give four, adding di\u1e6d\u1e6dhi.\n\n\u00a7 10. Avijja, ignorance as to the four great truths of Buddhism: suffering, the cause of suffering, the cessation of suffering, the path leading to the cessation of suffering.\n\n\u00a7 11. Ta\u1e47ha, craving. Besides those named in this sutta, San. S. enumerates k\u0101ma, r\u016bpa, ar\u016bpa, and r\u016bpa, ar\u016bpa, nirodha. Das. S. calls the three ta\u1e47has named in our sutta the three dhamm\u0101 pah\u0101tabb\u0101.\n\n\u00a7 12. Ogho, flood. The same as in the San. S. They are enumerated in the Das. S. under the heading of the four dhamm\u0101 pah\u0101tabb\u0101.\n\n\u00a7 13. Up\u0101d\u0101nam, attachment. The same as in the San. S.; they are not enumerated in the Das. S. The commentary Sumangala Vil\u0101sin\u012b agrees with the explanation given in Childers, s.v.\n\n\u00a7 14. Bhavo. The three bhavas are, according to the Sumangala Vil\u0101sin\u012b, the same as the three dh\u0101tus, which are explained by the commentary to signify the existence in one of the sattalokas. In the Das. S. the dh\u0101tus are enumerated as the dhamm\u0101 abhi\u00f1\u00f1eyy\u0101.\n\nI may remark here, that a Turnour MS. in the India Office Library, which bears on the outside the title Samyutta Nik\u0101ya atthakatha, contains the commentary on the A\u1e45guttara Nik\u0101ya.\n\u00a7 15. Dukkha\u1e41, suffering. Instead of \u201csams\u0101ra dukkha-\nta,\u201d San. S. as well as the commentary, read \u201csankh\u0101ra-\ndukkha\u201d; and so also Netti Pakarana, quoted by Alwis\n(Introd. 108). In Dh. 203 we read: jighacch\u0101 param\u0101 roga,\nsa\u1e45kh\u0101ra param\u0101 dukkha.\n\nIf it were not for the agreement of the Sinhalese and\nBurmese MSS., that would seem sufficient reason to alter the\nreading of Jamb. S. The reading, however, is quite intel-\nligible.\n\nSakk\u0101yo, individuality. Under Sakk\u0101yo S\u0101riputta enume-\nrates the five upadanakkhandha. The explanation Childers\ngives in his dictionary agrees with that given in the\nVisuddhi Magga, to which the Suma\u1e45gala Vil\u0101sin\u012b refers.\nIn the Das. S. they are enumerated under the heading of\nthe dhamm\u0101 parinibbeyy\u0101.\n\n1) JAMBUKH\u0100DAKASA\u1e42YUTTAM.\n\nEkam samayam \u0101yasm\u0101 S\u0101riputto Magadhesu viharati\nN\u0101lak\u0101gamake.1 Atha kho Jambukh\u0101dako paribb\u0101jako\nyen\u2019 \u0101yasm\u0101 S\u0101riputto ten\u2019 upass\u0101\u1e47kami upass\u0101\u1e47kamitv\u0101\n\u0101yasmata S\u0101riputtena saddhim sammodi sammodaniy\u0101m2\nkatham s\u0101r\u0101niy\u0101m vitis\u0101retv\u0101, ekamant\u0101n nisidi, ekaman-\nt\u0101n nisino kho Jambukh\u0101dako paribb\u0101jako \u0101yasmanta\u1e41\nS\u0101riputtam etad avoca: (1)\n\n\u201cNibb\u0101na\u1e41 nibb\u0101nan ti \u0101vuso S\u0101riputta vuccati.\u201d\n\u201cKataman nu kho \u0101vuso nibb\u0101nan ti?\u201d\n\u201cYo kho \u0101vuso r\u0101gakkhayo, dosakkhayo, mohakkhayo\u2014\nidam vuceati nibb\u0101nan ti.\u201d\n\u201cAtthi pan\u2019 \u0101vuso maggo, atthi patipad\u0101 etassa nibb\u0101-\nnassa sacchikriy\u0101y\u0101 ti.\u201d\n\u201cAtthi kho \u0101vuso maggo, atthi patipad\u0101 etassa nibb\u0101nassa\nsacchikriy\u0101y\u0101 ti.\u2014Katamo pan\u2019 \u0101vuso maggo, katam\u0101 pati-\npad\u0101 etassa nibb\u0101nassa sacchikriy\u0101y\u0101 ti?\u201d\n\u201cAyam eva kho \u0101vuso ariyo a\u1e6d\u1e6dhangiko maggo etassa\nnibb\u0101nassa sacchikriy\u0101ya:3 seyyathidam: samm\u0101ditthi, sam-\n\n1 S.

Sneyd Kynnersley, Esq.;\nand as Honorary Members,\nProfessor Kern of Leiden,\nHis Excellency the Marquis Tseng, the Chinese Ambassador at\nthe Court of London.\n\nThe Society has, therefore, elected twenty-three Resident\nagainst the loss of four Resident paying Members, and twenty-\nseven Non-Resident, against a loss of four Non-Resident\npaying Members; in other words, there is a clear gain to\nthe Society of forty-two new paying Members since the last\nAnniversary of May 19, 1879.\n\nOf the personal history of some of those whom we have lost,\na few words will now be said.\n\nMr. Guybon Henry Damant was born May 9, 1846, and\nafter receiving his first education in St. Paul's School, London,\nentered Christ's College, Cambridge, as Scholar and Exhibi-\ntioner. In May, 1867, he was selected for the Indian Civil\nService, and, in 1868, he took his B.A. degree, obtaining a\nSecond Class in the Classical Tripos. Both Mr. Peile, his\nClassical Tutor, and Professor Cowell, with whom he read\nSanskrit and Bengali, have a lively remembrance of the keen\ninterest he so early took in Literature and Philology.\n\nHe arrived in India Nov. 25, 1869, and was appointed\nAssistant Magistrate and Collector at Dinajpur, whence, in\nJanuary, 1873, he was transferred to Rangpur, where he\ngreatly distinguished himself by his brave exertions during\nthe Bengal famine\u2014partly, as a Transport Officer at Kaliyong,\nand, partly, as a Subdivisional Officer in charge of Govindjang\nfrom Dec. 1873, to Sept. 1874.\n\nIn recognition of his services during the famine, Mr. Damant\nwas appointed in Sept. 1874, Assistant Commissioner in\nKachar, and, in June, 1876, he was deputed on special duty to Manipur. Subsequently, in April, 1877, he became Deputy Commissioner, Fourth Grade, Garo Hills;\u2014in May, 1878, Political Officer in charge of the Naga Hills, and, a few months later, officiating Deputy Commissioner of the Third Grade.\n\nIn the summer of 1878, he made a short visit to England, for his marriage, during which period he spent a few days at Cambridge, where his old friends well remember his talking with the deepest interest and enthusiasm of the Naga and other wild tribes among whom he had lived; at the same time vividly describing their savage semi-chivalrous character, and adding, that \"they were a wild people to live among\u2014I am pretty sure to be killed by them some day.\" His friends little thought how soon this sad prognostic would be realized.\n\nMr. Damant returned to his post\u2014and, last October, proceeded with an escort to Khorama, to seize some ammunition, which the Naga had stored there, expecting that the natives would submit quietly. Unfortunately, however, on his approach, they fired upon the party, killing the Commissioner and about half of his escort (Oct. 14, 1879). During his busy official life, Mr. Damant never allowed his literary enthusiasm to slumber. Indeed, from his first arrival in India, he was keenly interested in the modern languages and folk-lore of the various tribes among whom his lot was cast; his earliest literary effort being a paper on Bengali folk-lore as illustrated by some legends collected by him in Dinajpur and printed in the Indian Antiquary for 1872. Even amid the incessant harass of the famine, his letters continually show, how he turned for a short relaxation to his favourite studies, allusions to Inscriptions and researches into the local dialects occurring at intervals amidst all the pressure of official work. His career, cut short though it was, in the midst of its usefulness, affords a bright example of literary enthusiasm, combined with a high-souled zeal for the public service.\n\nBeside the folk-lore of Dinajpur, Rangp\u00fcr and Manipur, he\ntook great pains in acquiring the dialects of the districts. Thus under the date of Dec. 1, 1874, he writes, \"I am working hard at the Manipuri and Kuki languages; but the not having any books or dictionary or writing of any description is the great difficulty.\" He published some notes on Manipuri Grammar in the Journal of Bengal Asiatic Society, and he had prepared a Dictionary, but most of the MS. was destroyed by the Naga in the stockade at Khorama.\n\nThe following is a list of his contributions to the Journals of the Bengal Asiatic Society, the Royal Asiatic Society and the Indian Antiquary:\n\nFor the first he wrote: (1) In vol. xliii. 1874, Notes on Shah Ismail Ghazi, with a sketch of the contents of a Persian MS.

J. F. S. Forbes, Deputy Commissioner at Sweegyeen, in British Burma, Oriental scholarship has lost a most ardent and promising follower. He went out to India in 1858 in the Queen's Army, but appears never to have visited any part of India Proper. His Regiment was stationed in British Burma, and he took such an interest in the country and people that he left the army, married a Burmese lady, and entered the Civil Department of the Province. In 1878 he published a most interesting volume called \"British Burmah and its People.\" Captain Forbes had opportunities of acquainting himself with native customs, turns of thought, legends and other good characteristics of the people beyond what falls to the lot of most other Englishmen; in his book, therefore, the Burmese appear on their best side. He was also a Pali scholar, and had paid much attention to Buddhist literature, in its Burmese development, and was of course a champion of Burmese ideas on that subject against both the schools of Nepal and of Ceylon,\u2014a position of much importance. All his knowledge was collected from original sources\u2014from the priests or from manuscripts, and is, therefore, a valuable controlling power upon the learned Buddhist scholars of Europe, who have never seen a live Buddhist and have little sympathy with the existing worshippers of Buddha.\n\nCaptain Forbes visited England in 1877, became a Fellow of this Society, and returned to Burma in 1878, full of energy, strengthened intellectually by intercourse with scholars at home, and with schemes for study and inquiry, which would have occupied a long life and have left an endurable mark on our knowledge of Indo-China\u2014but all was cut short by an illness in Nov. 1879, and we have but to record with sorrow the loss of another promising young scholar. Two papers by him have been printed in the Journal of this Society, Vol. X. the first entitled \"On Tibeto-Burman Languages,\" the second, \"On the Connexion of the M\u00f4ns of Pegu with the Koles of Central India.\"\nAndreas David Mordtmann, who was a Corresponding Member of this Society, was born at Hamburg on Feb. 11, 1811, and received his first education at the Seminary of St. Paul's Church, whence he passed to the Grammar School, called the Johanneum, which he quitted in 1829, with a view of proceeding to Vienna, in order to obtain a thorough knowledge of Turkish, in the first place, but, afterwards, of other Oriental Languages. This intention, however, he had to relinquish, for want of means, but, for all this, he allowed no obstacle to stand in the way of earning his bread by giving instruction.\n\nHe was supported in this object by the great diplomatist Dr. Syndreas Sieveking, who was able to secure for him the appointment as a Sub-Librarian to the Hamburg Municipal Library, a post he held from 1841 to 1845. In 1836, he married Christina Brandmann. On Nov. 6, 1845, the Philosophical Faculty of Kiel conferred upon him the Degree of M.A. and Phil. Dr., and, in the same year, he was sent as the Hanseatic Keeper of Archives (or as Clerk of their Chancery) to Constantinople, under the Spanish Minister, Don Antonio Lopez de Cordoba, then in provisional charge of the Hanseatic Legation, having been entrusted with this duty by Sir Patrick de Colquhoun, when he resigned that appointment.\n\nFrom the end of 1847 to 1859, he was Charg\u00e9-d'Affaires to the Hanse Towns at the Sublime Porte. Since August, 1851, he was, also, Consul at Constantinople for the Grand-Duke of Oldenburg.\n\nOn the Legation being suppressed by the Hanse Towns in 1859, Dr. Mordtmann passed over into the Turkish Service, as a Judge of the Commercial Court, a position he continued to hold, while, at the same time, never omitting to prosecute, also, his one great object, of obtaining and enlarging to the utmost his Oriental knowledge. Dr. Mordtmann was from his earliest youth an enthusiast in all matters appertaining to Oriental knowledge or to that of Eastern affairs.\nHence, while he wrote or edited several independent works, he was, also, an energetic contributor to the pages of the Journal of the German Oriental Society, his especial study having been the coins of the Sassanian Rulers of Persia, with that, also, of other numismatic records, bearing upon this main subject.\n\nOf the separate works he published may be mentioned:\u2014\n(1) A short description of Magrib el Akse\u2014or the Morocco States\u2014from a geographical, statistical and political point of view\u2014Hamburg, 1844, with map; (2) Das Buch der L\u00e4nder von Shech Ibn Ishak el Farsi el Isztachri, a translation from the Arabic, with Preface by the illustrious Carl Ritter\u2014Hamb. 4to. 1845\u2014the same work, the text of which had been printed at Gotha in 1839 by J. H. Moeller; (3) A History of the Conquest of Mesopotamia and Armenia, translated from the Arabic of Mohammed ben Omar-al-Makadi, accompanied by observations by A. D. L. G. Niebuhr, with additions and explanatory remarks\u2014Hamburg, 1847, 8vo.; (4) Description of the coins with Pehlevi Inscriptions (reprinted from the Journal of the German Oriental Society)\u2014Leipzig, 1853\u20138; (5) Siege and Capture of Constantinople by the Turks in 1453\u2014Stuttgart and Augsburg, 1858; this essay was translated into Greek; (6) The Amazons\u2014Hannover, 1862\u20138.\n\nThe following is a list of the papers he contributed to the Journal of the German Oriental Society, and, besides these, it is likely that there are many others, the whereabouts of which is not known, or perhaps easily attainable:\u2014Transactions of the German Oriental Society, vol. ii.

After successfully passing the usual examination at the end of the four years' course, he went in 1840 to Berlin, to attend the lectures of Savigny, but the classes of Boeckh, Bopp, Lachmann and Tredelenburg had more interest for him than that of the great lawyer, and, eventually, he gave up himself entirely to his favourite philological pursuits. On his return to St. Petersburg in 1843, he was appointed Professor of Latin, and, eventually, of Greek, in the First Grammar School, and devoted himself to the study of the Classics, and, in an especial manner, to the Greek Philosophers. A few years later, he attached himself specially to the study of Tibetan, for which the libraries of St. Petersburg afforded unusual facilities, and, after having been appointed, in 1848, one of the Librarians of the Imperial Academy, he was elected, in 1852, a member of that learned body\u2014the cultivation of the Tibetan language and literature being assigned to him as his special function. Simultaneously, he held from 1860 to 1873, the Professorship of the Classical Languages in the Roman Catholic Theological Seminary. After a fortnight's illness, which from the first gave rise to grave apprehensions, Dr. Schiefner died on Nov. 16 of the last year. In three distinct directions, Schiefner has made his mark in literary history. In the first, he contributed to the Memoirs and Bulletins of the Imperial Academy of St. Petersburg, a number of valuable articles on the language and literature of Tibet, of which the following may be considered to be the most important: (1) Additions and Corrections to Schmidt's Edition of the Dsanglun, 1852; (2) The life of \u00c7akyamuni, translated in Abstract from the Tibetan, 1853; (3) On Foucaux's Edition and Translation of \"Rgya tch'er rol pa,\" 1850; (4) Studies\non the Tibetan Language, 1851, 1856, 1864, 1867; (5) On the periods of human decadence from a Buddhistic point of view, 1851; (6) Translation of the Forty-two Sutras, 1851; (7) On some Eastern versions of the Legend of Rhampsinitus, 1869; (8) Buddhistic Stories translated from the Tibetan 1875\u20137; (9) On Vasubandhu's Gatha-Sangraha (the Tibetan Dhammapada), 1878.\n\nHe, also, published separately, in Tibetan and German, Vimala praj\u00f1ottara-ratanam\u0101la, 1858; and Taranatha's History of Buddhism in India, 1869; in Tibetan and Latin, Bharata's Answers, 1875; and the ancient Sanskrit-Tibetan-Mongolian Glossary (Mahmoutpatti), 1859.\n\nWhen his fatal illness overtook him, he was busy in collecting and arranging materials towards a work on the Bonpo or pre-Buddhist Religion of Tibet.\n\nIn the second place, he was engaged for several years in preparing for publication the linguistic materials left behind him by the famous scholar Castr\u00e9n\u2014who, after spending twelve years among the Ugro-Finnish tribes, had finally succumbed to the hardships he had had to endure. Schiefner was able to bring out twelve volumes on the subject. Of these, two are narrative, seven treat of the languages of the Samoyedic tribes, the Koibal, Karagasas, Tungusian, Buryat, Ostiak and Kottic tongues; and three contain Castr\u00e9n's researches on the mythology, ethnology and literature of the tribes he had visited. This mass of material, in the Library of the University of Helsingfors, would probably have remained long unavailable to modern scientific examination, had not Schiefner made it of general use by a lucid translation, from Swedish into German, of the catalogue he drew up. His independent works under this head are, translations of the great Finnic Epic (Kalevala), 1859, and of the heroic poetry of the Tatars of Minussin, 1859; as well as a number of highly interesting essays on Finnish Mythology (1850\u20131862).\nWhile still thus engaged, he was led to turn his attention to the languages of the Caucasus; the Tush language being the first on which he brought to bear his wonderful philological acumen\u2014on which, after some preliminary efforts, he brought out a complete essay in June, 1854. It was mainly through the study of this work, that the Baron de Uslar was induced to study on the spot the other languages of the Caucasus. Schiefner has given in the Annual Address of the President of the Philological Society, 1879, a full account of these special researches.\n\nAs bearing on this portion of his studies, the following papers by him may be recorded:\u2014(1) Essay on the Avars, 1862, with a fuller account of the language of these people, and a collection of texts and translations, 1872; (2) Essay on the language of the Udes, 1863; (3) On P. von Uslar's Abchasian studies, 1863; (4) Researches into the Tchetchenz language, 1864; (5) Report on P. von Uslar's Kasi-Kumuk studies, 1866; (6) Reports on P. von Uslar's Investigation of the Hurkanian, 1871, and Kurinian Languages, 1873.\n\nWith regard to another Caucasian language, the Osset, M. Schiefner had made many and thorough investigations. This dialect, as is well known, belongs to the Iranian stem. For it, he made many translations, the results of which, with the original text, he gave to the Bulletins of the Academy between 1862 and 1867; much of the information, thus made available to the public, being derived from native soldiers of the districts still speaking these dialects. It is probable that few scholars have had the advantages he had in this respect, and it is certain that no one has availed himself of these advantages so much for the promotion of linguistic studies as has done M. Schiefner. His loss, as a foremost student of the languages of Tibet and of the Caucasus, is to be deplored for scientific reasons; but it is pleasant to add that a large number of friends in Europe and America, to whom he was allied by ties of the most intimate\nfriendship, deplore this also. In the Bulletin de l'Academie Imp\u00e9riale des Sciences de St. Petersbourg, tome xxvi, M. F. Wiedemann has given an elaborate account of Dr. Schiefner, the larger portion of four quarto pages being devoted to a list of his various works.\n\nThe Rajah of Beswan, Takur Giri Prasad Singh, died on the 20th of March, at the early age of thirty years, and is succeeded by his son Kumar Gururad Dhaj Singh. He was an enthusiastic patron of Sanskrit literature, and is best known among Sanskrit scholars by his Edition of the \"Yajurveda,\" which together with a Hindu Commentary, he printed at his own cost. Not many months ago he issued a paper in Sanskrit announcing his intention of having a new Edition of the \"Yajurveda,\" with its Sanskrit commentary, printed at Oxford, under the superintendence of Professor F. Max M\u00fcller. It is to be hoped that the son may carry out the intentions of his father.\n\nAfter a brief sketch of the lives and works of distinguished Oriental scholars, not in all cases actually connected with the Society, who have passed away during the past year, it is usual to allude to deceased members, who have given a lustre to the Society by their public services or by distinction in other branches of science.\n\nForemost among these, on this occasion, comes John Lord Lawrence, who, for many years, was a member of this Society, though he rarely attended the meetings, or, during his career, exhibited any special taste for Oriental studies. Born in the year 1811, he entered the Bengal Civil Service in 1830, and rose, by the regular grades, to the rank of Magistrate and Collector at Delhi. Even then, he was known as a thoroughly earnest and efficient officer, remarkable for his personal activity and his accurate knowledge of the duty of Settling and Collecting the Land-Revenue of the State. But a higher destiny awaited him:\u2014in 1846, he was, at the close of the Sikh war, especially chosen by Sir Henry Hardinge to be Commissioner of\nthe newly-annexed Province of the Jhelandhar Doab, beyond the River Sutlej. When, after the lapse of three years, the Punjab, also, was annexed, he was promoted to a seat in the Board of Administration. In a few years, when Lord Dalhousie found it was necessary to entrust that Province to a single officer, John Lawrence was chosen to be Chief Commissioner, and till the year 1857, he carried out that new and improved system of managing the affairs of subject provinces, which has since been the model for British India. He was about to resign the service, when the Sepoy Mutiny of May, 1857, burst upon Northern India; and the course of events, and the success which attended the efforts he made in the Punjab to save the Empire, elevated him to a distinction and popularity, which has not been equalled in the annals of British India. He returned to England in 1859 a Baronet, decorated with the Grand Cross of the Bath, a Privy Councillor, a pension specially voted, the thanks of the Houses of Parliament and a seat in the Council for India.\n\nIn 1863, on the sudden death of the then Viceroy Lord Elgin, and when a troublesome war had broken out on the frontier, Sir John Lawrence was sent to India in his place, and remained there for five years of peace and prosperity. He returned to England in 1869, and was elevated to the Peerage. The distinguishing features of his life were a simplicity of character, a clearness of grasp of the subject, a firmness of purpose, and a singleness of motive. He was not gifted with eloquence of speech or elegance of composition, but he expressed himself by word of mouth or on paper, so clearly, that he could not be misunderstood: he obeyed implicitly the orders he received: he made others obey him. He trusted his subordinates, won their confidence and kept it for a quarter of a century, and never threw them over. A mighty horseman, and an indefatigable despatcher of business, he got over more country and cut his way through a thicker mass of work than was possible to others not endowed with such\nphysical strength and intellectual activity. Hence the success which attended his career. He was a worthy representative of his country's best characteristics: for he was kind to the people of India, careful of the resources of the provinces committed to his charge, ready to listen to others and to hear both sides, wise in Council and brave in difficulties. The true nobility of his character showed itself, in that he was as unspoilt by his unexpected though not undeserved honours, as he was constant and never despairing in the hour of peril, through which, by the grace of God, he passed triumphantly. His name will long be remembered by the people of the Punjab, and will not be forgotten in the annals of India.\n\nIn General Sir John Low, who died recently at Norwood in his 92nd year, it is no exaggeration to say that Indian history has lost one of the most perfect links between the past and the present.\n\nBorn so long ago as Dec. 13, 1788, with a career of fifty-five years in India, Sir John Low is fully entitled to be regarded as one of India's \"representative\" men; indeed, it is but right to say that, in four of the great crises of modern Indian history, he was one of the mainstays of the Empire. As a soldier, his earlier years were of high promise, but it was as a diplomatist and politician that he has left the deepest tracks in history. His first military service was in 1805, when he took part in the operations against the French and against the Dutch in Java: subsequently, in 1812, he served in the threefold capacity of Brigade Major, Persian Interpreter, and Chief of the Intelligence on the Staff of Colonel Dowse, when operating in the Southern Mahratta country. In 1816, he was Commissariat officer to Baron Tuyll's brigade in the campaign against the rebels in the Guntoor districts, and, in 1817, he was present with Sir John Malcolm as his Aide-de-Camp at the battle of Mehidpore in Malwa.\n\nOn all these occasions, he greatly distinguished himself, and was repeatedly mentioned in despatches and general\norders. In March, 1818, acting as First Assistant to Sir John Malcolm, Lieut. Low was in command of a force of more than 4000 men, his operations with them in the district of Chindwara being completely successful and his services publicly acknowledged. In the same year Capt. Low was employed in the intricate negotiations between the Peishwa, Baju Rao and Sir John Malcolm, and fully sustained the high opinion that had been formed of his abilities; hence, when the Peishwa retired to his estates at Bithoor, known afterwards as the residence of Nana Sahib (Baju Rao's adopted son), Capt. Low received the appointment of Resident Commissioner, which he held for six years, the Marquess of Hastings and Lord Amherst alike expressing their fullest satisfaction with his conduct. In 1825, Capt. Low was transferred to the post of Political Agent at Jeypore, and in 1830, was appointed by Lord William Bentinck, Resident at Gwalior, in which office he displayed a remarkable knowledge of the Native Courts by refusing to join and skilfully thwarting the intrigues that were set on foot against the Regent Bace.\n\nIn 1831 he was sent to Lucknow, where he remained (with the exception of some months of sick leave at the Cape) till 1842, when ill health compelled him to return to Europe, after an absence of thirty-eight years. His services were rewarded by the Companionship of the Bath\u2014and after five years, he returned again to India in 1847, becoming Agent in Rajpootana, till at length in 1852 he was appointed Resident at the Court of the Nizam, where he was able to negotiate the important Treaty, by which the Berars were ceded to the British Government. At the end of 1853, he was appointed the military member of the Supreme Council, and continued to fill this responsible post throughout the period of the Indian Mutiny. In 1862 Sir John Low was created a K.C.B., and in 1873 received the Grand Cross of the Star of India.\n\nSir Richard Rawlinson Vyeyan, Bart., who died recently, was born in 1800, and educated at Harrow School. Early in life\nhe took an active part in politics, as member successively for the County of Cornwall, Oakhampton, Bristol and Helston. After 1857, he retired altogether from public life to his curious old seat at Trelowarren, where he formed by degrees a very fine library, and gave himself up entirely to those literary pursuits which had engaged his attention in his earliest years. In 1825, he had printed for private circulation, \"An Essay on Arithmo-Physiology,\" which purported to be \"A Chronological Classification of Organised Matter.\" Sir R. R. Vyvyan was one of the oldest members of the Royal Society, having been elected in 1826.\n\nCouncil.\u2014The Council having heard that it was proposed to break up the India Museum, at South Kensington, a special meeting was called and met on Tuesday, August 5, at which the following resolutions were passed:\n\n1. That the Council of this Society, having heard with extreme regret of the intention to break up and disperse the contents of the India Museum, now at South Kensington, beg leave to enter their most earnest protest against this proposition, which they consider will deprive the public of the best means for Indian research, and be a great discouragement to all interested in Indian Science: they feel it to be a retrograde step to destroy a collection of objects, many of them of great value, which, if once dispersed, it would be nearly impossible to replace, while if kept together, as a nucleus, it might be increased to almost any extent, by loans or donations from private sources.\n\n2. That, having been given to understand that reductions are in contemplation by which the expense of maintaining the Museum will be very considerably lessened, the Council of the Royal Asiatic Society trust that arrangements may be made, by the Council for India in conjunction with H. M. Government, by which the collection may be preserved intact in its present form and position, till, at least, sufficient time may be\nallowed for more mature consideration of the best means whereby this noble collection may be best utilized for the promotion of the scientific and artistic requirements of our great Indian Empire.\n\nDuring the last year, your Assistant Secretary, Mr. Holt, has employed himself in making a Catalogue of the large collection of Chinese works belonging to this Society. This Catalogue has been now finished\u2014but only a portion of the slips have as yet been pasted down. This will probably be accomplished during the ensuing autumn. The detailed report of the way in which this Catalogue has been executed will be given below under \"China.\"\n\nAUDITORS' REPORT.\n\nThe Auditors observe with pleasure that the anticipations of the improved financial position of the Society are fully borne out by the result. The Balance at the Bankers is nearly seventy pounds in excess of what it was last year; there are no outstanding liabilities of any kind, while the regular income of the Society is now nearly \u00a3100 better than it was three years ago.\n## ABSTRACT OF RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURE FOR THE YEAR 1879.\n\n### 1879.\n\n#### RECEIPTS.\n\n| Description                                      | \u00a3 s. d. |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Balance at Bankers', January 1, 1879              | 177 1 6 |\n| 130 Resident Members                              | 409 10 0|\n| 60 Non-Resident Members                           | 63 0 0  |\n| Arrived Compositions\u2014Two Non-Resident Members    | 14 0 0  |\n| Donation from Council for India                   | 210 0 0 |\n| Dividends on Consols                               | 20 11 4 |\n| Rent\u2014British Association (including \u00a317 allowance)| 117 0 0 |\n| University Extension (including \u00a35 allowance)     | 0 0 0   |\n| Sale of Transactions                              | 5 9 2\u00bd  |\n| **Total Receipts**                                | 1068 6 2\u00bd|\n\nBalance in Treasurer's hands, Jan. 1, 1879\n\nAmount of Society's Funds, Three per cent.

Part III.\u2014In his paper, \"On a Comparative Study of the Japanese and Korean Languages,\" Mr. Aston compares them with other languages; 1, as to their phonetic systems; 2, as to the functions of their grammar; and 3, as to the character of their grammatical procedures. In the first case, he showed that the vowel system of the Korean is much richer than that of the Japanese, some of the vowels in each, however, being the result of a comparatively recent development; and added a careful analysis of the consonantal systems in each\u2014thus proving that each has borrowed largely from the Chinese. In the second case, he pointed out, that these grammatical forms largely depend on the habits of thought characteristic of the language of a nation, and traceable also in their religion, their art, and their political and social development; the mental feature distinguishing the Chinese, Japanese and Koreans from the Aryan and Semitic peoples being, an impersonality of conception. The educated Chinese or Japanese is a downright materialist. In the third case, he showed that almost the only grammatical procedures employed by the Japanese and Chinese are, the addition of suffixes and the position of words in the sentence. Augment,\nablaut, vowel changes, as in the conjugations of Semitic verbs, and reduplications, are not employed for the purposes of grammar, and, with few but unimportant exceptions, there are no prefixes. There is no direct alteration of the root, and although the addition of a suffix is sometimes the occasion of a phonetic change in itself, in the root, or in both, this is a fact of a different order from the German ablaut, or the vowel changes in the Semitic verbs. Mr. Aston added that the degree in which the root and the suffix are consolidated is less in Japanese than in Korean, partly owing to the greater complexity of the phonetic system of the former language, and, partly, because the Japanese have had for a thousand years a written language, notoriously, the most effectual obstacle to phonetic changes. In conclusion, Mr. Aston discussed at some length, the noun, pronoun, numerals and the position of words in a sentence.\n\nIn his paper \"On the Dialects of Colloquial Arabic,\" Mr. E. T. Rogers called attention to the remarkable differences existing in the pronunciation of Arabic in various parts of the East, and even among different classes in the same district, with full illustrations of his meaning: at the same time, giving a curious account of a special colloquial language in which children are first spoken to, and in which they express their first wants and limited ideas, together with a vocabulary collected by him in Damascus. To these Mr. Rogers added a brief notice and table of the conventional signs used by accountants in Egypt at the present time, the basis of the money calculation being the piastre, which is divisible into forty pars, and these again into ten guzus or gedids. The last is not, however, represented by any coin\u2014but is simply a fractional part used in calculation.\n\nMr. Brandreth's paper has been noticed in the Report of last year, pp. xxviii-ix.\n\nVol. XII. Part. I.\u2014In his paper \"On a newly-discovered Cylinder of Cyrus the Great,\" Sir Henry Rawlinson showed\nthat we have now, at last, an undoubted native record of the genealogy of Cyrus, in the order given by Herodotus, viz. 1. Achaemenes, 2. Teispes, 3. Cyrus, 4. Cambyses, 5. Cyrus the Great, at the same time calling attention to many curious matters, especially with reference to the religion then prevailing in Babylonia, as shown by the inscription on this Cylinder. The Cylinder itself was, probably, deposited by the king himself in one of the temples of Merodach in Babylon, shortly after his conquest of that city. It appears that a king was then in power in Babylonia who had taken some measures for strengthening the fortified places, but who had, at the same time, incurred the ill-will of the local priesthood by neglecting the Temples and tampering with the ceremonial worship. This king was certainly Nabu-nahid\u2014the Nabonidus of the Greek writers\u2014and his offence was, that he had allowed the rites of Merodach \"king of the gods\" to be superseded by the worship of inferior deities.\n\nMr. J. W. Redhouse, in his paper \"On the most comely names, i.e. the titles of praise bestowed on God in the Qur\u2019an or by Moslim writers,\" pointed out that the popular notion of the Arabs having given 99 names to God was altogether erroneous; the fact really being, that, if all such names or titles were extracted from Arabic writers, the whole number of them would be more than 400. He added that the many and various names used by Dervishes and others, in their public or private worship, were, in truth, no part of the regular ritual of Isl\u00e1m, as handed down by tradition from the Prophet himself. The titles used by the Dervishes were for the most part arranged by them for recitation\u2014and, as each order had its special list, the total number was practically indefinite. In confirmation of this statement, Mr. Redhouse read many passages from the Qur\u2019an.\n\nM. Sauvaire's Supplement to his Treatise on Weights and Measures, printed in the Journal of this Society, Vol. IX. n.s., is valuable in that he has been able to supply from a MS.\nin the Library at Gotha the whole of Chapters V. to X., and portions of Chapters IV. XI. XII. and XIII., which were missing from the MS. preserved in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale at Paris, of which he gave transcripts two years ago.\n\nThe Babu Rajendralala, in his paper, \"On the Age of the Caves of Ajanta,\" urged that the figures with the flowing dresses and conical caps represented Persians; that the chief personages in the Drinking scenes were Bactrians; and that the pictures, generally, referred to phases of Indian life in the last century B.C. and the first A.D. These views he mainly grounded on the character of the Inscriptions, said to exist in some of these caves, the evidence from Palaeography being, in his judgment, more satisfactory than that derivable from Architectural forms. Mr. Fergusson in reply contended that while there was no sufficient evidence of the date of these Inscriptions, the evidence deducible from the architecture of the different caves was wholly opposed to the theory proposed by the Babu; and, further, that, in taking no notice of the date found at Badami, of \"500 years from the coronation of the Saka king,\" i.e. A.D. 578\u20139, the Babu had neglected the cardinal point on which every discussion must hinge. Any attempt, Mr. Fergusson held, to fix the date of a given cave without taking the above date into account, is worthless, as we know exactly the date of the character in which this inscription is written, and, as certainly, the character of the architecture of the caves in which the inscriptions are found (see Burgess, Reports, vol. i. pl. xxiv\u2013xxxv).\n\nMr. Robert Sewell, in his \"Note on Hiouen-Thetaang's Dhanakacheka,\" expressed a belief that Amravati, which is situated on a level plain, cannot be identified with the buildings described by the Chinese pilgrim at the capital city of Dhana-kacheka, but, on the other hand, that those now existing at B\u0113zwada, a place on the river Krishna about forty miles from\nthe sea, and seventeen miles from Amravati, do agree remarkably well with the description preserved.\n\nMr. Fergusson, on the other hand, was not disposed to consider the language attributed to Hiouen-Thsang so rigorously precise as Mr. Sewell thought, basing this opinion on the fact that the life of Hiouen-Thsang was dictated to his secretary, Hoeili, long after his return from India, while the Si-yu-ki was compiled from his notes by men who had never been in India at all, and who were, therefore, wholly unacquainted with the localities referred to. It should be added that Mr. Sewell has himself made considerable excavations at Amravati, and has been fortunate in finding, at this place, sculptures far more perfect than any of those recently transferred from the old India Museum to the British Museum. It is to be hoped that steps may be speedily taken to bring these interesting monuments to England. This paper, like the last, is printed in Vol. XII. Part I.\n\nProfessor Dowson, in an interesting paper \"On a curious litigation between the Smartava Brahmans and the Lingayats, during which two Copper Plate grants were produced,\" stated that the Smartava Brahmans in the South of India possess twelve Maths or Monastic Institutions of high antiquity. The chiefs of these Maths are held in high honour, and among the outward marks of their dignity, is the privilege of being carried in a palki crosswise, so as to sweep the road. These Brahmans were much troubled by the Lingayats, a dissentient sect, some six or seven hundred years old, who were very numerous in their neighbourhood. The Chief of these Lingayats, to assert his own dignity, caused his palki to be thus carried, the result being riots and disturbances. At length, the head of a Brahman Math brought an action against the Lingayat for damages, in compensation for the loss of the honours he deemed due to him, at the same time producing two Copper Plates, of the twelfth century A.D., and purporting to be grants of this special privilege from a monarch\nof the time. The Brahman, having lost his suit, appealed to Her Majesty in Council, translations of two of the Copper Plates being sent home to support the appeal. As these translations, however, were unintelligible, the case was referred back to India, but, though many years have now elapsed, nothing more has been heard of it. The impressions of the Copper Plates, which were sent home, having been very defective, Professor Dowson suggested that endeavours should be made to obtain more accurate copies, as the originals are, certainly, of some interest and antiquity, and contained many curious references. He added that there was reason for suspecting these Copper Plates to be forgeries, as there occurs on them the name of Madhava, a teacher, who lived two centuries after the date ascribed to them. Moreover, the words rendered cross palki, do not bear this meaning.\n\nProfessor F. Max M\u00fcller, in a well-worked out paper, \"On the Discovery of Sanskrit Texts in Japan,\" stated that the time had now at length come when the long-since expressed hope of the late Professor H. H. Wilson and of other scholars had been realized by the obtaining, if not from China, yet from Japan, vid China, certain Sanskrit texts, the first of them being a Glossary of Chinese words, with their equivalents in Sanskrit, together with the transliteration of the Sanskrit words in Japanese, the Sanskrit being written in an alphabet nearly the same as the old Nepalese. The Professor stated, that it was a well-known fact that, beginning almost from the commencement of our era, there has been a constant flow of Sanskrit MSS. from India to China. The earliest translators of Buddhist works in China were those who worked under the Emperor Ming-ti, viz. K\u0101\u015byapa, M\u0101tanga and Tsu-fa-lan, their most important works being, the \"S\u016btra of the Forty-two Sections\" and the translations of the \"Dasabh\u016bmi-S\u016btra\" and of the \"Lalita Vistara,\" comprising the legendary life of Buddha.\n\nAs such works would not have been translated unless they\nhad acquired a substantive authority in India, the Professor argued that these translations, in themselves, enable Buddhist scholars to assign to the Sanskrit originals, so far at all events as they agree with the Chinese translations, an ante-Christian date, a point of great importance in the comparative study of the ancient religions of the world. The late Professor H. H. Wilson, the Professor added, used all his influence to set on foot an inquiry, in which he was warmly seconded by Sir John Bowring, then English Minister in China, to trace up, if possible, the Sanskrit MSS. which must, once, have been common in China. But, though letters were sent to the authorities of monasteries and temples, while, at the same time, many catalogues of libraries were examined, no results were obtained. The first renewal of hope was the book brought by Dr. Edkins to Oxford from Japan, referred to above; the existence of it clearly proving that there must have been a time, when the Japanese Buddhist priests were still able to read Sanskrit. At length, Professor Max M\u00fcller obtained, through a pupil of his, a Buddhist priest, residing in Oxford, Mr. Bunyiu Nanjio, a Japanese book, sent to him by a native scholar, Shuntai Ishikawa. This book was a Sanskrit text, very corrupt, it is true, written in the same old Nepalese alphabet, each word being transliterated in the Japanese letters, and translated into Chinese. A corrected text of the S\u016btra in Sanskrit, with an English translation and notes, was laid before the Meeting of the Society.\n\nHere, then, was the unexpected reward of long-continued research, and there is therefore good hope that where one Sanskrit text has been found, others may follow. That the Sanskrit text, now discovered in Japan, is an original text, is proved from the fact that there must have been an original from which the Chinese translation of A.D. 400, possibly even an earlier translation of A.D. 220, was made,\u2014while there can be no doubt that if some more of such MSS. can be met with,\na new start will be possible in the study of Buddhism, more especially of the Buddhism of the North.\n\nThe Japanese Minister, His Excellency Mori Arinori, was present at the reading of Professor Max M\u00fcller's paper, and promised to lend every assistance in his power to recover, if possible, some more of these ancient Sanskrit texts.\n\nTo Captain Durand we are indebted for a paper entitled \"Extracts from a Report on the Islands and Antiquities of Bahrein,\" in which a detailed account was given of the researches of this officer, which were briefly alluded to in the Report of last year, p. xvii. Captain Durand spent several weeks in these islands, the result being the discovery of a great number of ancient sepulchres, and possibly, also, of some temples; showing that these islands were, at a very remote period, occupied by colonists from the mainland, the site being, at the same time, considered to be, in an especial degree, a sacred one. Captain Durand's original paper was in the form of a Report addressed to Lieut.-Colonel E. C. Ross, H. B. M. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and was forwarded by him to A. C. Lyall, Esq., Secretary of the Government of India, Foreign Department. In this letter, a general description was given of the locality and of its peculiarities, with some details of the excavations Captain Durand was able to make, and of his discovery of a piece of black marble, bearing an inscription in the Hieratic Babylonian Cuneiform character, which was really the most valuable monument he met with.\n\nIn illustration of this remarkable monument (which was laid on the table of the Society at their meeting), Sir Henry Rawlinson added, \"Notes on Captain Durand's Report upon the Islands of Bahrein,\" in which he showed the importance of this maritime region in the earliest period of the world's history, Babylonia having been mainly instrumental in imparting civilization to Western Asia; and adding that the Babylonians themselves admitted that they received all their knowledge from the mysterious islanders of the Persian Gulf.\nThe tradition, he stated, preserved by Berosus, of Oannes or \"the Fish God,\" who came up from \"that part of the Erythrean Sea which borders on Babylonia, to teach the inhabitants of the country between the Tigris and Euphrates letters and sciences and arts of every kind,\" evidently points to this period of primitive civilization.\n\nThe question is, who were these primitive \"fathers of knowledge,\" who first civilized the settlers on the Tigris and Euphrates, and whose memory is, perhaps, preserved in the legend of the Garden of Eden, and Tree of Knowledge? For many reasons, Sir Henry concluded that they were a dark race\u2014the ancestors of the \"black heads\" of the Inscriptions, possibly, too, the same as the Adamites of Genesis. Clearly, they do not belong to what is called the Semitic family of nations, as there is hardly a name in the original mythology or geography of the region, which can be traced to a Hebrew or Arabic root. Most probably, judging from their language, they were of the same race as the later Akkads of Babylonia\u2014the same commercial influences having applied to them, as to the much later Phoenicians. Commerce, indeed, always sharpens the intelligence and pioneers the way to civilization. The emporia of commerce between India and the Mediterranean must have been along the Persian Gulf, because, in the infancy of navigation, mariners would scarcely dare to strike straight across from Aden to the Malabar Coast, but would naturally be inclined to hug the shore from the Persian Gulf to the Indus\u2014the valley of the Euphrates, at the same time, offering the best facilities for inland transport westwards.\n\nSir Henry then discussed, at considerable length, the legends connected with the worship of \"Ilia or Oannes,\" as illustrated from Cuneiform records; and pointed out, that, while the Persian Gulf was famous for the worship of the Sun, the worship of Mercury\u2014the Sun's closest attendant\u2014was the cult, with which the Bahrain discoveries are most\nclosely connected. The inscription on Captain Durand's black stone, with the transliteration, \"Hekel Rimugas, eri-Inzak Agiru,\" i.e. \"The Palace of Rimugas, the servant of Mercury, of the Tribe of Ogyr,\" has the highest value, in that the name Rimugas is of undoubted Accadian etymology, while Inzak appears on a bilingual fragment as the Accadian name for Nebo or Mercury. To this may be added, that, throughout the Assyrian tablets, there is a constant allusion to an island, called (in Akkadian) Nidukki [in Assyrian Tileun or Tilmun], which is unquestionably the same as Bahrein; moreover, that this name is so frequently associated with two others, Milukh and Magan, that the three places may be assumed with certainty to be in the same neighbourhood. Though only, incidentally, mentioned in Inscriptions of a remote antiquity, the first historical notice of Nidukki is in the account of the great Sargon's career (about B.C. 1600), in which this king is stated to have reached \"the lower sea,\" or Persian Gulf, and the country of \"the black heads,\" and to have reduced Nidukki and another seaport, of which the name is incomplete. In conclusion, Sir Henry stated that, in his judgment, Apir, answering to the Biblical \"Ophir,\" was probably situated at either Katif or Gerrha, and was the same as Milukh, both of these names perhaps signifying the Upper, in contradistinction to \"Magan,\" the Lower. At whatever precise spot this port may have been situated, it was, no doubt, from the earliest times, the emporium of Indian commerce, and, on this account, attracted the navies of Solomon, the articles with which his ships were loaded being, as is well known, Indian both in name and character.\n\nTo Professor Vamb\u00e9ry we owe a paper on the \"Uzbek Epos,\" in which he very fully described the contents of a remarkable, perhaps unique MS., of the Library at Vienna, written in the first decade of the sixteenth century, with the object of celebrating the glories of the great Uzbek Chieftain,\nSheibani-Khan, by Prince Muhammad Salih (formerly a ruler in Khwarezm), and subsequently, Sheibani's General and Court Poet. This Poem, a regular Epos in seventy-nine cantos and about 8000 lines, was not, he said, to be confounded with a small and insignificant treatise, edited in 1849, by the Russian Orientalist, M. Berezin. Considering the general belief, that the poetical Epopee is confined to the Aryan and Semitic races, it was important to know, that, though far inferior to many Persian compositions of the kind, in a poetical point of view, the full right of this Turkish work to the title of \"Epos\" must be now acknowledged. M. Vamb\u00e9ry then gave an outline of its contents, and stated that the first three cantos contained the usual praises and salutations to Allah and Muhammad, a description following from the fourth to the fifteenth, of the moral and physical qualities of his hero, and of the superiority of his arms and armour. Then comes a canto, which, as giving the author's reasons for writing the poem, is a valuable contribution to its literary history. The narrative commences with Sheibani's first march upon Samarcand, then governed by Baki Tarkhan; then follows an account of the Uzbeg Chief's successful struggles with the Trans-Oxianian dynasty of the Timurid\u00e6, in which Baber plays a prominent part, particularly in the story of the siege of Samarkand, and of the troubles the founder of the Moghul Dynasty in India had to undergo at the hands of his triumphant rival.\n\nAfter the expulsion of Baber and the downfall of the Mirzas (as the Timurid\u00e6 were also called) in Trans-Oxiana, which led, also, to the defeat of the relatives and auxiliaries of the Moghul, such as Khaneka Khan and his younger brother, Aladja, Sheibani crossed the Oxus and entered on the long war, partly with the children of Mirza Husein Baikara, partly with Khosru Sh\u00e2h, the lord of the district comprising Badakhshan, Khatlan, Dervar and Shignan. The Turkish Prince was defeated and slain. Prince Salih describes very\nfully the next campaign, in which the Uzbegs suffered very severely; indeed, would not have prevailed, but for the indomitable perseverance of Sheibani; he does not, however, follow his hero to the zenith of his career in his conquest of Khorassan and of Herat in A.D. 1507.\n\nProfessor Vamb\u00e9ry attributes this to his death, probably, on the field of battle; and it is clear from the details of his descriptions, that the author must have been himself present at most of the scenes he depicts. In conclusion, M. Vamb\u00e9ry treated of the ethnographical importance of his MS., of the contributions it made to geography, especially to that of the Khanates of Central Asia, and to its linguistical and poetical value, at the same time, giving many extracts from it, one of which was curious, being a versified speech of the Emperor Baber.\n\nMr. Redhouse read a paper, \"On the Identification of the 'False Dawn' of the Moslems with the 'Zodiacal Light' of Europeans,\" in continuation of one printed in the tenth volume of the Journal of this Society, New Series: this paper, which has just been printed in Vol. XII. Part II., is chiefly interesting for the letters the writer received from Astronomers all over the world, accepting the justness of his views on this subject. The papers by Messrs. Damant, Fergusson and Bendall, were prepared for, and have been printed in Vol. XII. Part II.\u2014but they were not read before the Society. That by Mr. Schindler, also in Vol. XII. Part II., has been noticed in the Report for 1879.\n\nThe last paper, that by M. de la Couperie, which has been read at the ordinary meetings of this Society, if not the most important, has many curious suggestions in it, which may ultimately, as the author imagines, lead to new and un-anticipated results. The title of it was \"Le Yh-King et les Origines occidentales de la civilisation Chinoise.\" In it, he pointed out the great value of the work entitled \"Yh-king,\" for the history of a considerable portion of the world. The \"Yh-king,\" he said, which has never yet been properly understood, comprehends\na series of lists of events, customs, countries and words, arranged in their natural order. The lists recall the syllabaries, recently revealed to us by the Cuneiform discoveries, in proof of which assertion, the writer gave a complete translation of one chapter. He then showed what he believed to be a complete identity between the lists so given, and the Cuneiform syllabaries.\n\nPassing on, thence, to the history of the language, M. de la Couperie pointed out the phonetic peculiarities, the musical intonations, and the grammatical characteristics, which proved, in his opinion, the most ancient Chinese to be a remote member of the Amardian branch of the Uralo-Altaic agglutinative tongues; thus connecting the Susan with the Ugro-Finnic dialects. This part of his subject was illustrated by a hundred or more common words. The writer then set forth the history of the writings, and, notably, what he called the Hieroglyphic revival in the ninth century B.C., which followed a species of writing, with the same leading characteristics as Cuneiform. He then gave abundant examples of remarkable similarities between the oldest Chinese characters and those termed Akkadian. In conclusion, he stated his belief, that there must have been many and much more complete syllabaries, over the whole of the regions once subject to Chaldaean influence, the probability being that a number of families or tribes (to whom no generic name can be given) arrived in China about the twenty-fifth century B.C. These tribes, coming from the west, must have left their neighbours in Northern Susiana, at a time when the elements of feudal agglomeration had already commenced in the kingdom of Susa, and thus brought with them to their new homes in the far north-east, the rudiments they had received of Akkado-Chaldaean culture.\n\n*Asiatic Society of Bengal.*\u2014Vol. xlviii. parts 1, 2, 3, edited by the Philological Secretary, contains papers by J. H. Rivett-Carnac, on Prehistoric Remains in Central India, and\non the snake symbol in India, especially in connection with the worship of Siva;\u2014by W. Irvine, On the Bangash Naw\u00e1bs of Farrukh\u00e1b\u00e1d;\u2014by F. S. Growse, On the sect of the Pran\u00e1thas;\u2014by Lieut. R. C. Temple, Rough Notes on the distribution of the Afghan Tribes about Kandahar;\u2014and by Brajnatha Bandyopadhyaya, Hamir Rasa or the History of Hamir, Prince of Ranthambor. In his first paper, Mr. Carnac gives a very interesting account of researches among the Tumuli around Nagpore by himself, Mr. A. Lyall and Mr. Blanford. Similar barrows have been found in various parts, but those at Junapani, five miles from Nagpore, form by far the most numerous collection yet discovered, the largest single group consisting of 54 tumuli. In all the groups, the tumuli are of the same type\u2014consisting of circular mounds of earth of various sizes surrounded by single and, in some cases, by double rows of trap boulders. The diameter of the circles vary from 20 to 56 feet, the latter being apparently a favourite number, as many barrows were found of exactly this size. In each circle, there are generally three stones of larger dimensions than the rest, and these selected stones bear \"cup marks\" exactly resembling those found on similar European tumuli. One of the stones is 10ft. 3in. by 2ft. 4in. by 2ft. 6in. and must weigh eight tons. This stone is covered all over by cup marks. The paper is illustrated by a map and four well-executed plates. In his second paper, Mr. Carnae states that his chief object has been to ascertain whether the worship of the Snake and of Mah\u00e1deo, or the phallus, may be considered identical, and also whether the presence of the serpent on the prehistoric monuments of Europe can be shown to support his theory, that the markings on the Cromlechs, etc., are real traces of this nature-worship, and have thus found their way to Europe from the east. This paper is illustrated by two plates.\n\nMr. Irvine's paper, \"On the Bangash Naw\u00e1bs of Farrukh\u00e1b\u00e1d, a Chronicle of A.D. 1718\u20131857,\" is an elaborate continua-\ntion and completion of a former paper by him, which has been printed in vol. xlvii. 1878. The account of \"the Sect of the Pran-n\u00e1thas\" by Mr. Growse, though that of a small and obscure body, is of value, if for no other reason, that the late Professor H. H. Wilson, in his History of the Religion of the Hindus, stated that he had never been able to procure any specimens of their literature. Mr. Growse, when at Mathura, was so fortunate as to obtain a copy of one of Pran-nath's poems\u2014which is curious for the advanced liberalism of its theological ideas, and for the rude uncouthness of the language made use of. The construction of the sentences is purely Hindi, while the vocabulary is mainly supplied from Persian and Arabic sources. The founder of the sect, in the commencement of the eighteenth century, a Kshatrya by caste, endeavoured, though not with much success, to compile a new religion out of a compromise between Christianity and the Koran. His known treatises are fourteen in number, all in verse: Mr. Growse has published the text and translation of the fourteenth, Kiy\u00e1mat-n\u00e1ma. The followers of Pran-n\u00e1th are generally known by the name of Dhamis, from Dham, a name of the Supreme Spirit or Paramatma. Lieut. Temple's paper consists of \"Notes\" jotted down from time to time, in the spring of last year, first, when foraging in the advance of General Stewart's Division on the march back from Kelat-i-Ghilzai to Kandahar\u2014and, secondly, when taking a convoy of camels to Colonel Patterson's reconnoitring expedition down the Arghisan valley. Two sketch-maps accompany the paper.\n\nPart 4 contains papers by Mr. H. St. Barbe, \"On Pali derivations in Burmese;\" and by Mr. S. E. Peal, \"On a peculiarity of the river names in Assam and in some of the neighbouring countries.\" In the first, Mr. St. Barbe points out that the Burmese alphabet, doubtless introduced at an early period, like the religion, literature and a large portion of the language of the people, has never yet been analysed with any care, and\nthat its square variety approaches more nearly to that of the Asoka Inscriptions than to any other Indian modification. This alphabet was adopted en bloc, and, for twelve of the thirty-four consonants, the Burmese have not themselves found any use. Mr. Peal's is a curious paper as showing in how many instances the syllables Di or Ti enter into the composition of river names in Assam and the adjacent countries (even, also, in some instances in Western India), clearly proving that it must have meant \"water\" among many of the Hill Tribes, the other portion of the word being the true name of the river, and in many cases descriptive in character. The names of rivers and of mountains frequently survive the extinction of the races from whom they derived their original names, a good instance of which may be noticed in the river nomenclature in America. Mr. Peal gives a list of more than 250 names in confirmation of his theory. The other papers in this Part by Messrs. Growse and Smith on Antiquities, and by Mr. C. J. Rodgers on Coins, will be noticed under their respective heads.\n\nIn the Proceedings of the Society, are papers more or less brief, by Mr. E. Thomas, On Jainism (from the Athen\u00e6um);\u2014by Dr. Sundberg, On the Norwegian Taters (Gipsies), their language and its relation to Hindi;\u2014by F. S. Growse, Esq., On Bulandshahar Antiquities;\u2014by H. Rivett Carnac, Description of some stone carvings collected on a tour through the Doab from Cawnpore to Manipuri, with Plate;\u2014by Major Waterhouse, Note on the Fourth Edition of General Walker's map of Turkestan;\u2014by Major-General J. T. Walker, Exploration of the Great Saupo River, with plate;\u2014by Captain W. F. Gowan, Geographical information respecting the Kirghiz Steppes and Country of Turkestan afforded by the book of the Great Survey, translated from the Russ by Captain Gowan;\u2014by J. Cockburn, Notes on Stone Implements;\u2014and by Major Waterhouse, Notes on the Survey Operations in Afghanistan, in 1878\u20139.\nCeylon Branch, Royal Asiatic Society.\u2014The only papers in this newly revived Journal connected with Oriental studies are two on Inscriptions, one by the late Dr. Goldschmidt, On an ancient Cingalese Inscription; and the other by Dr. M\u00fcller, on one at Mahintale. These will be noticed under \"Epigraphy.\" There is also a brief paper in Part 1 for 1880, by M. M. Kunte, M.A., On Vedic and Buddhistic Politics.\n\nAsiatic Society of Japan, vol. vii. pt. 3 and 4, contains, as is usual, much interesting information, in papers by Messrs. McClatchie, J. M. James, A. J. C. Goertz, B. H. Chamberlain, R. W. Atkinson, W. G. Aston, W. Anderson, Rev. J. Summers and E. Satow. In Part 3, in his paper, \"On the feudal Mansions of Yedo,\" Mr. McClatchie gives a curious historical account of the Yashiki or former palaces of the nobles, which were occupied down to the recent Revolution, but are now fast disappearing\u2014by being converted into shops and stores. They do not, however, seem to have been of any great antiquity. Mr. E. Satow adds a long and valuable paper, \"On the Transliteration of the Japanese Syllabary,\" his main object being to construct a practical system so as to enable Japanese to be written in Roman characters without confounding pronunciation or meaning, and by the acquisition of far fewer rules and exceptions (so he states) than are required to be known so as to pronounce English, French or Dutch correctly. In Part 4 Captain James prints a paper, \"On Infinite Vision as attained by Buddha,\" being the translation of a discourse delivered in a temple at Shinagaha in August, 1878, by a priest name Sata Kaiseki. The sermon consists of a series of arguments intended to produce belief in the intellectual perfection and holy state, to which Buddha attained\u2014and of an account of the various stages of discipline through which the novice must pass. Mr. B. H. Chamberlain gives an interesting paper, \"On Wasanbijawe, the Japanese Gulliver,\" the authorship of which is anonymous,\nthough the style and the allusions, with which the work teems, clearly show, that the author must have been not only an educated man\u2014but that he had a moral and philosophic end in view, to be taught by the means of fables. Mr. W. Anderson adds a concise and clear history of \"Japanese Pictorial Art,\" in which he shows that the appreciation of criticism of paintings is quite as general in Japan as in the Western Hemisphere;\u2014the rules of criticism being, however, for the most part unwritten and handed down from man to man by direct demonstration, and cultivated from year to year by minute and persevering study. Mr. E. Satow gives a second part of his \"Ancient Japanese Rituals.\"\n\nIn vol. viii. pt. 1, are papers by R. W. Atkinson, entitled, Yatsaga-take, Haku-san and Tata-ya-ma;\u2014by W. G. Aston, On the proposed arrangement of the Corean Alphabet;\u2014by J. Milne, Notes on Stone Implements from Otara and Hakodate;\u2014and by Mr. J. H. Gubbins, Hideyoshi and the Satsuma Clan in the sixteenth century. The first paper by Mr. Atkinson is a narrative of a very interesting journey made by him through a mountain district of Japan, which has scarcely (probably never) been traversed before by Europeans. Mr. Aston's is a very brief paper suggesting the order in which he considers it would be convenient to arrange the Corean alphabet for the future, it being admitted that the present one is extremely inconvenient and irregular. Mr. Gubbins's paper on the Japanese clans of the sixteenth century points out the great value of their local history, a large number of such books having been preserved, so as to supplement, in a remarkable manner, the more \"general\" histories. One of the Clans, that of the Satsuma, remained practically independent, till only the year before last\u2014in fact, was really, an imperium in imperio. Mr. Milne's paper has been noticed under \"Antiquities.\"\n\nJournal of the Straits Settlements, July, 1879, contains\npapers by W. A. Pickering, On Chinese Secret Societies, pt. 2;\u2014by W. E. Maxwell, On Malay proverbs, pt. 3;\u2014On the maritime code of the Malays, the reprint of a paper by Sir Stamford Raffles;\u2014by D. D. Daly, On Caves at Sungei Batu in Selangor; with many other articles of greater or less interest, but not necessary for notice in this Report. Mr. Maxwell's paper is a continuation of former ones, and not less interesting than they were. Some of the proverbs are very curious, and show acute observation. The Malay proverbs have been carefully compared by Mr. Maxwell with those of other peoples. Other collections of them exist, as yet untranslated, in the Dutch and French works of Klinkert and Favre. In a trip to Gunong Blumut, Mr. Hervey collected several words of the \"Camphor\" language, and so was able to add a supplement to those published by Mr. Logan several years ago.\n\nJournal Asiatique, 7th series, vol. xiii. pt. 3, May\u2014June, 1880, contains papers by:\u2014M. Leon Rodet, Le\u00e7ons de Calcul d'Aryabhata:\u2014by M. Stan. Guyard, Notes de Lexicographie Assyrienne, 2de article:\u2014by M. Rubens Duval, Notice sur le dialecte de M\u00e2loul\u00e2:\u2014by M. Ren\u00e9 Basset, Po\u00e8me de \u00c7abi en dialecte Ghelha, texte, transcription, et traduction Fran\u00e7aise:\u2014and by M. Zotenberg, Traduction Arabe du Trait\u00e9 sur les corps flottants d'Archim\u00e8de.\n\nIn the first paper, M. Rodet, who is well known for the researches he has made on similar subjects, gives an interesting notice of the author, who flourished between A.D. 500 and 550, being, during a portion of that time, a teacher in Pataliputra, and the contemporary of Varaha Mihira of Ujein, and of other well-known Indian Mathematicians. The text of the Aryabhatiyam was published at Leiden by Dr. Kern in 1874, who relied on two MSS. in the Malayalam character, copied, in 1820 and 1863 respectively, and on a third in the possession of this Society. In his second article, M. Guyard con-\ntinues his \"Notes on Assyrian Lexicography,\" in which he combats the views assigned by previous Cuneiform scholars with reference to the meaning of many individual words. M. Duval's paper gives an interesting account of the Syriac words collected by M. Huart during his travels in the East, compared with those given by M. Ferrette in the twentieth volume of the Journal of this Society, and M. N\u00f6ldeke in the twenty-first volume of the Trans. Germ. Orient. Soc. A further and more complete essay on this subject is promised by the writer. In the \"Po\u00e8me de Qabi\" M. Basset gives a valuable addition to our knowledge of the Chella, one of the Berber dialects, with a list (so far as at present known) of the MSS. in it, as well as of the printed books in this dialect. M. Zotenberg gives an Arabic text of the principles enounced in the famous Hydrostatical Treatise of Archimedes, preserved in a MS. of Biblioth. Nation. of the date of a.h. 358 (A.D. 968), translations of which in Greek and Latin are already known. At the end of this part M. Devic gives a brief note \"Sur l'origine Etymologique de quelque noms de nombre.\" M. L\u00e9on Feer reviews Colonel Mainwaring's grammar of the Rong (Lepcha) language; together with Mr. Neighbor's Vocabulary in English and Mikir; and M. Derenbourg discusses the question whether the word Qatu is of Semitic origin; and M. de Harlez reviews with great severity Mr. K. Geldner's Translation of extracts from the Zend Avesta.\n\nVolume xiv. part 1, July, 1879, is as usual entirely occupied with M. Renan's Report on the progress of Oriental research, in which we are glad to see, that, this year, some notice is taken of the works of scholars, who are not Frenchmen.\n\nVol. xiv. pt. 2, M. de Harlez contributes a fourth article, \"Sur les origines du Zoroastrisme.\" M. Feer continues his Buddhistic researches in \"Le Livre des cent Legendes\u2014Avad\u0101na \u00c7ataka,\" in which he discusses the date given by General Cunningham, in the Preface of his \"Corpus Inscrip. Indicarum,\" for the Nirv\u0101na of Buddha, namely, b.c. 478,\nThe solitary MS. of this work was for a long time preserved in the Bibl. Nationale, Paris, but recently, Dr. Wright has placed two others in the Library at Cambridge, which he procured from Nipal. M. Imbault-Huart gives a paper entitled \"La poesie Religieuse des Nosairia,\" a Syrian tribe, who have kept themselves and their creed remarkably distinct from their neighbours and enemies, the Ismaelians and Druze, but whose history has been carefully examined by MM. Catafago, Wolff, Salisbury and Guyard. Their religious system, so to call it, is very curious, and comprises a sort of Trinity\u2014consisting of *Mana*, the original Divinity; *Ism*, the Divinity as seen by men; and *B\u00e1b*, the doctrine of which *Ism* is the living exponent (p. 195). M. Huart points out the error of Volney, which has been followed by many other writers, of confounding the *Nosairia* with the *Ansairia*. M. Lenormant adds a \"postscriptum\" to the \"Hymne Chaldeen au Soleil,\" arising out of some suggestions of M. Fritz Hommel, a young Assyriologist of the University of Munich.\n\nIn part 3, M. Feer continues his Buddhistic studies on the *Avad\u0101na \u00c7ataka*, and shows the importance of considering, together and as members of a single group, the four *Avad\u0101nas* known as the *Avad\u0101na \u00c7ataka*, the *Kalpa-druma Avad\u0101na*, the *Ratna-Aavad\u0101na-mala*, and the *Dvavim\u00e7ati Avad\u0101na*. M. Imbault-Huart contributes a short but interesting paper, \"On the wars between the Chinese and the natives of Corea, between A.D. 1618 and 1637,\" in which he points out the remarkable resistance of the people of these islands to any contact with foreigners, which has indeed, even as yet, been only partially broken through by the Missionaries. Much light, as is known, has been thrown on this dark subject by M. Scherzer's work entitled \"Journal d'une Mission en Cor\u00e9e,\" one of the publications, for 1878, of the Ecole des langues Orientales vivantes. M. Mehren, of Copenhagen, gives in detail the curious correspondence between the Sufi philosopher Ibn Sabin Abd-al-Haqq and the Emperor Frederic II. (Hohenstaufen), A.D.\n1232\u20131242, of which he had previously furnished the outline before the Oriental Congress at Florence. To M. Amari (see Journal Asiatique, 5 ser. tome i. p. 240) is due the discovery of the Christian Prince to whom the Muslim Philosopher addressed these replies, by detecting the word *imberatour*\u2014or Emperor, which had been previously read incorrectly, and supposed to refer to some member of the family of Della Torre of Milan, although the MS. (which is preserved in the Bodleian) gives the other titles, also, of \"King of Roum, and Prince of Sicily.\" M. Sauvaire, to whom this Society has been indebted for more than one paper, follows up his favourite studies by a paper, \"Sur la Numismatique et Metrologie Musulmanes,\" which is full of learned and useful research. At the close of this number is an excellent and appreciative review of M. Vamb\u00e9ry's last work, \"Die primitive Cultur des Turko-Tatarischen Volkes,\" Leipz. 1879.\n\nIn volume xv. part I, Jan. 1880, a short account is given of the new Phoenician types which have been cut on purpose for the \"Corpus Inscriptionum Semiticarum\" about to be printed in Paris\u2014with a notice of the fonts at present existing in Europe, from which it appears that Paris already possesses two, Vienna one, with a number of variants, and Parma one, the oldest in existence, engraved by Bodoni in 1804. There are none at Oxford, Berlin or St. Petersburg. Copies are also given of the Phoenician types used by the Duc de Luynes and M. de Sauley. For the new work, it has been wisely determined to have distinct types for the Archaic and the Neo-Phoenician. M. Guyard contributes a third paper, entitled \"Notes de Lexicographie Assyrienne.\" The part is closed by an interesting paper by M. Imbault-Huart, on \"Chinese Journalism;\" by a review by M. Feer of Mr. Cust's \"Sketch of the Modern Languages of the East Indies;\" by one from M. Barbier de Meynard of M. Rieu's \"Catalogue of the Persian MSS. in the British Museum;\" and by a short notice from M. Oppert, of \"Le premier si\u00e8ge des Assyriens et des Pheniciens,\" in\nsupport of the views he had formerly set forth at a meeting of the Biblical Archaeological Society.\n\nIn volume xv. part 2 (Feb. March, April), M. Clermont Ganneau continues his valuable notes on \"Le Coupe Ph\u00e9nicien de Paleqtrine;\"\u2014M. Maspero gives a paper entitled \"Etudes de quelques peintures et sur quelques textes relatifs aux Fune-railles;\"\u2014M. de Harlez adds a fifth paper, \"Sur les origines de Zoroastrisme;\"\u2014M. Sauvaire publishes the first part of his \"Mat\u00e9riaux pour l'Histoire de la Numismatique et de la M\u00e9trologie Musulmanes, viz. Monnaies;\"\u2014The Marquis de Vogu\u00e9 gives a very interesting account of the form of the tomb of Esmunazar King of Sidon, whose inscribed sarcophagus is, as is well known, one of the most valuable remains preserved in the Louvre, with some happy references for the interpretation of the Ph\u0153nician legend engraved on it. Lastly, M. S\u00e9naart gives the first portion of his \"Etude sur les Inscriptions de Piyadasi.\" Some of these papers will be referred to more fully under their respective subjects.\n\nGerman Oriental Society.\u2014Since the last Report, vol. xxxiii. parts 3 and 4, and vol. xxxiv. part 1, have been published, together with a Catalogue of their Library\u2014and are as usual full of valuable matter. Those relating to special subjects will be noticed in their appropriate places. Among the more general, may be noticed in vol. xxxiii. part 3, a contribution from M. Vamb\u00e9ry, On the speech of the Turkomans, and on the Diwan Machdumkuli's\u2014while at the close of the number is a review by W. Schott of the work he published last year, \"Ueber die primitive Cultur des Turko-Tatarischen Volkea.\" Professor Spiegel gives a short paper on \"Adar Gushasp:\" and Count Victor von Strauss and Torney, one on the \"Bezeichnung der farben blau und gr\u00fcn im Chinesischen Alterthum.\" There is also an able notice by Th. Noldeke of Baethgen's \"Sindban oder die sieben weisen Meister, Syr. u. deutsch.\"\nArchaeology.\u2014The most important archaeological work of last year, is Major-General Cunningham's \"Stupa of Bharhut,\" which he has called \"A Buddhist Monument,\" and described \"as ornamented with numerous sculptures illustrative of Buddhist Legend and History in the third century B.C.\" This Stupa was first discovered by him in Nov. 1873, and in the subsequent years, 1874 and 1875, the whole monument was carefully excavated by himself and Mr. Beglar: since then, all the sculptures have been safely removed 600 miles to Calcutta, with the consent of the owner of the ground, the Raja of Nagod. General Cunningham considers the date of this Stupa to be from 250 to 200 B.C. The village of Bharhut is situated about 120 miles S.W. of Allahabad, and it does not seem possible to identify it as any ancient site, the name of which has been recorded. General Cunningham has arranged his work under the following heads:\u2014I. Description of the Stupas; II. Sculptures; A. Supernatural Beings; B. Human Beings; C. Animals; D. Trees and Fruits; E. Sculptured Scenes; F. Objects of Worship; G. Decorative Ornaments; H. Buddhist Buildings; K. Miscellaneous Objects; III. Inscriptions. The book is accompanied by a small map which clearly shows the position of Bharhut with reference to Allahabad, Banaras, Buddha Gaya, etc., and by fifty plates, chiefly photographs of the principal sculptures found there, together with dress-ornaments in outline and copies of inscriptions. There is, as might be expected, a considerable resemblance between the sculptures at Bharhut and those at Sanchi, and the one supplements and confirms the other; there are, also, some remarkable variations of type and some new forms.\n\nThe next most important work that has been accomplished this year is the renewed and now complete survey by Mr. Burgess of the \"Buddha Rock Temples at Ajanta,\" forming part No. 9 of the Archaeological Survey of Western India. The spot where these caves are is, as is well known, at the\nhead of one of the Gh\u00e2ts, which divide the table land of the Dekhan from Khandesh in the valley of the Tapti. The caves, which would seem to be about twenty-nine in number, have been repeatedly visited during the last fifty years, and have been more or less fully described by Sir J. E. Alexander, Mr. Fergusson and others. Mr. Burgess's account, however, is the most complete that has, as yet, been made public, embracing as it does more than 100 pages of closely printed text, with 30 plates, containing copies in outline of most of the paintings still remaining in Caves I. II. X. XVI. and XVII., some of which, as that representing two torans or gateways, like those at S\u00e2nchi and Bharhut (Pl. XI), and the landing and coronation of Vijaya in Ceylon from Cave XVII. (Pl. XIX.), though of more than usual interest, are reproduced from Plates in Mrs. Spiers's \"Ancient and Medi\u00e6val India,\" vol. i. 1869. Mr. Burgess also gives copies of the Inscriptions from Cave XXVI.\u2014and a transcript by Bhagvanlal Indraji of a curious Sanskrit inscription, in 1795, in a garden at Cintra, and possibly there still. He has added, in Appendix A, a useful notice of the Buddha Mythology of Nipal, illustrated by five plates in outline. The information and the facsimiles are due to Bhagvanlal Indraji. It may be mentioned that Mr. Burgess has quite recently spent some weeks in the early part of this year at Ajanta, and that we have every reason to hope that the detailed knowledge he has been thus able to secure will set at rest and for ever many hitherto conflicting theories.\n\nMr. Burgess has also edited, as part of \"The Archaeological Survey of Western India,\" a \"Report of the Architectural and Archaeological Remains of the Province of Kachh,\" which has been drawn up by Dalpatram Pranjivan Khakhar, Educational Inspector. This paper forms No. CLII. of the new series of \"Selections from the Records of the Bombay Government.\" The work consists of a description of forty-four places in that province of more or less archaeological interest,\nwith a notice of the K\u0101mpahat\u0101s of Kachh, already given in the Indian Antiquary, vol. vii. Feb. 1878. Besides this, there are also four appendixes, the first containing copies of forty-six Inscriptions in the Devanagari character, many of which, however, are quite modern and of little value or interest, and a note by Bhagvanl\u0101l Indraji on a small collection of coins sent from Kachh\u2014the second, ten outline drawings of different palaces and temples\u2014the third, a genealogical table of the Sam\u0101s and J\u0101dij\u0101s of Sindh, Kachh and R\u0101thi\u0101w\u0101d\u2014and the fourth, five papers on Kachh antiquities, by the late Sir Alexander Burnes, with an account of the ruins at Majal, Guntri and Mandavi respectively, a description of the Alum mines at Madh, and of a Religious Sect at the same place.\n\nMr. Burgess, who has quite recently returned from India, has, in type, No. 10 of the Archaeol. Survey of India, May, 1880, with inscriptions of Buddhist Rock Temples, by Bhagvanl\u0101l Indraji and additions by Dr. B\u00fchler and Mr. Fleet. The volume is illustrated by a large number of plates, including many from Ajanta. Those at N\u0101sik, Kanheri and N\u0101n\u0101gh\u0101t, are not, as yet, ready for detailed description.\n\nAnother work which did not reach the Society in time for notice in the Report of 1879, is Babu Rajendralala Mitra\u2019s \u201cBuddha Gaya, the hermitage of Sakya Muni\u201d\u2014which has been recently printed at the cost of the Government of Bengal. Buddha Gaya and its remarkable remains have been well known for the last seventy or eighty years, the site having been visited by a host of travellers, antiquaries and others, but no systematic excavations seem to have been made, though partial ones were attempted by Major Mead in 1863 (see Cunningham\u2019s Reports, vol. iii. p. 87), and by General Cunningham himself, p. 88. Three years since the Babu was sent there by the Government of Bengal, on the occasion of the restoration of some parts of the structure by the order of the King of Burmah. Hence this work, which professes to give an account of what the Babu was able to do himself (though this is, after\nall, little more than General Cunningham had already accomplished;\u2014and of the information, etc., he was able to collect on the spot. The work is divided into six chapters containing, respectively. 1. Buddha Gaya, its situation, etc.; 2. The Penance of Buddha; 3. Architectural remains; 4. Sculptures; 5. Inscriptions; 6. Chronology. It is illustrated by 50 plates, including 12 photographs, 4 maps, and several plans.\n\nWith the exception of his work on the Bharhut Stupa, General Cunningham has not published anything himself, since the appearance of his fifth volume in 1875, but the eighth volume of the Survey Report by his assistant Mr. Beglar appeared in 1878, and is the last that has as yet reached this country. On the occasion, however, of the army marching into Afghanistan, Mr. Beglar accompanied it as far as Ali-Musjid, where he excavated a very interesting Buddhist monument, and made an extensive series of photographs, copies of which have duly arrived in England. Many of the monuments at Ali Musjid are of much antiquarian interest owing to the excellent preservation in which they have been found. The originals are in plaster and comparatively small, but they seem to show distinctly the position of the different mouldings, of which so many have been found at Takht-i-Bhai and Jamal, in confused heaps of ruins. By their aid General Cunningham thinks it will be possible to cover most of Masson's bare stone topes with an ornamental coat of plaster, divided into bands of niches and panels, containing figures of Buddha, and various scenes from the different legends of his life. The row of lions he considers to be quite new: and that they ought to have been separated from each other by stout pilasters, so as to give something more appropriate than a lion's back for the support of so great a weight. The topes were all opened by Mr. Beglar, who obtained a silver relic-casket, in the shape of a hemispherical domed stupa, containing three gold coins of BAZO\u0394HO, or Vasudeva, the natural inference being that these topes belong to the time of the\nearly Indo-Scythic Princes. Incidentally, it should be mentioned here, that at a meeting of the Institute of British Architects on Jan. 12, 1880, Mr. W. Simpson gave a very full and careful description of the \"Buddhist Architecture in the Jelalabad Valley\" and offered, by means of his admirable drawings, very strong evidence of the influence of Greek Art, derived as this must have been almost certainly from the Greek kingdom of Bactrians, upon the populations who occupied that country after its extinction.\n\nDuring the last cold season, General Cunningham visited a number of out-of-the-way places in the Punjab, such as Kafirkot to the west of the Indus, below the junction of the Kuram River; Arab, near the peak of Sakeswar, in the Salt range; and Rokhai on the Indus. In Chine, 11 miles north of Amritsur, he believes he has discovered the site of Hiouen-Thsang's China-pati (where Kanishka kept the Chinese hostages)\u2014a ruined fort, fifty feet high, which according to the local report was \"as strong as the wall of Alexander.\" In Mogul Beg's map, it is entered as Chineyard, to which Wilford has added \"Alexander's Mound.\" General Cunningham proposes next to visit all the old places in the Eastern half of the Central Provinces, whence many valuable inscriptions have been procured. One of these gives the names of several princes of one of the aboriginal races, the Savaras, who all bear the title of Gupta, and must have reigned about the sixth or seventh century A.D. The Savaras are, no doubt, the Sabarze of Pliny.\n\nSince Mr. Burgess's return to India in October last, a new Rock-cut Vih\u0101ra has been brought to light, at Bh\u0101ja near Karle, which, if not the very oldest, is certainly one of the most ancient Buddhist monuments, now known to exist in Western India. Owing to the fact that, when first discovered, it was full nearly to the roof with mud, the sculptures with which it has been profusely adorned are in a nearly perfect state, and of the most interesting character. They are in\nmany remains unlike any found in any other case in India, but whether they are older or more modern than those of the Siala or Bharhut remains to be determined. A description of this case with the necessary illustrations will be added as an appendix to the work on the \"Cave Temples of India,\" by Messrs. Ferguson and Burgess, which is in the press and will be published almost immediately.\n\nDuring a recent tour in the Northern Districts of the Madras Presidency, His Grace the Duke of Buckingham paid a flying visit on the 30th of last January, to the Tope at Amaravati. Having sent out a working party beforehand, they uncovered, during the Duke's stay there, what appeared to be the foundations of the Southern Gateway, and a considerable portion of the procession path, that surrounded the monument. During these operations they found, also, a considerable number of sculptured slabs, which were in situ and in a nearly perfect state.\n\nIf these are not the same as those laid bare by Mr. R. Sewell while conducting excavations there for Government two years ago, it shows that the interest in this monument is far from exhausted, and that a thorough excavation of it would add considerably to our knowledge of Indian Art, at the period of its greatest perfection. Meanwhile it is to be hoped, that efficient means will be taken for the protection of the sculptures that have been hitherto exposed, as all those that have been hitherto exposed have been removed by the natives for building purposes, or burnt for lime. As it seems almost impossible to protect them efficiently on the spot, the best plan would be to remove them to some place of safety either at Benares or Madras. It is, also, extremely desirable, that some of them should be sent to this country\u2014as those at the British Museum are so injured by exposure to our climate as to be only ghosts of their former selves, and convey no idea of the exquisite details and sharpness of outline that characterize their original state. It should be added that Mr. Sewell is\nnow preparing for the Government of Madras a full report \"On the Amravati Tope and on his Excavations there in 1877;\" and, further, that the printing of it has been sanctioned by the Secretary of State for India. This Report is divided into seven distinct Sections, and will be illustrated by various Plans, etc.\n\nIndian Antiquary.\u2014The Indian Antiquary, under the careful editing of Mr. Burgess, has continued to do good work during the past year, and contains many papers of great interest and value. Among these may be mentioned those by that well-skilled antiquary, Mr. M. J. Walhouse, by Major Watson, Messrs. Swinnerton, Caerff, W. Simpson, Hartshorne, Burgess, H. H. Howorth, J. F. Fleet, E. Thomas, Rev. S. Beal, and the Rev. Mr. Ayerst. Mr. Walhouse, in his first paper, \"On the Westward Spread of some Indian Metaphors and Myths,\" shows that the idea preserved in the doomwords of Belshazzar is prevalent in other parts of the East, and that, from the idea of weighing the bodies of accused persons, came the analogous one of weighing souls after death (though this latter was probably the original fancy), which appears in almost every Eastern form of faith, and has spread into almost every region of the west. Thus, in the Zend-Avesta, Mithra and Rasne-rast weigh the actions of men on the bridge Chinvat, which separates earth and heaven, and so, too, in Proverbs xvi. 2, \"The Lord weigheth the Spirits.\" The most ancient traces of this idea are, naturally, to be found in Egyptian mythology nearly 1500 years B.C. In his second paper, Mr. Walhouse gives an interesting account of \"Some rude sepulchral stone monuments in India, Persia, and Western Asia,\" and states that, in his opinion, though, no doubt, the large majority of rude stone ornaments in India and elsewhere are sepulchral, there are some, the construction of which suggests that they must have been altars or temples. Belonging to one of these latter classes he considers the Trilithon at Bhirbh\u00fbm, the\nCromlech at Palliconda, and the Mants (long heaps of stones) in Tibet and Tatary.\n\nMajor J. W. Watson's two papers are entitled \"The fall of the Patan Somanath\u2014a ballad of the fall of Patan;\" and \"Notes on the Sea-Coast of Saurashtra, with a few remarks on the extent of the Chud\u0101sama rule,\"\u2014the former gives a curious account of a poem relating to the fall of Patan, which Colonel Tod obtained in only a fragmentary state, but Major Watson, on the other hand, in perfect condition: it is of interest to the philologist from the dialect in which it has been composed, i.e. Hindustani and Gujarati, with frequent Hindi, Arabic and Persian words: the second gives a new view of the history of this district, deduced from existing inscriptions.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Swinnerton and Mr. W. Simpson contribute two papers, both arising from opportunities afforded to them during the recent war in the N.W., the one entitled \"Ancient Remains in Afghanistan,\" the other, \"Buddhist Remains in the Jelalabad Valley.\" In the former, originally published in the Times, Mr. Swinnerton notices many monuments he considers to be of undoubted Buddhist origin, finding at one place, under a chunam coating 40 to 50 ft. in length, \"the ancient cornice of the top whence sprang the dome-shaped dagoba.\" He then gives a detailed account of the village of Hadah, about five miles south of Jelalabad, \"an ancient city of Buddhist temples and monasteries,\" and almost as celebrated for its caves, which have been excavated into the rock to an average depth of 40 ft., and covered with plaster\u2014with, in many instances, domed roofs. One immense tope he visited, the Khaista or \"beautiful,\" is 115 ft. square at the base, and upwards of 100 ft. high. Mr. Simpson's paper contains a brief but clear account of the excavations he himself conducted, with the aid of a working party procured for him by the late Sir P. L. N. Cavagnari. He confirms Mr. Swinnerton's statement with respect to the square bases of the\nAfghanistan topes, and considers that the architectural details (Indo-Corinthian, as he terms some of the pilasters) show in a marked manner the influence of Greek art. Some of these caves have been already mentioned in the \"Ariana Antiqua.\"\n\nMr. B. F. Hartshorne gives an account of \"The Weddas of Ceylon,\" who, occupying a district on the eastern side of the island, about twenty miles long by forty broad, are divided into the Kel\u0113 Weddo or Jungle Weddas, and the Gan Weddo or Village Weddas, the former only being of importance to the ethnologist. The general features of the Wedda are Non-Aryan, and one marked characteristic of them is, that they never laugh. They appear to be devoid of any religious knowledge, and are not even acquainted with the name of Buddha. Their vocabulary is characterized by an almost total absence of any Dravidian element.\n\nMr. Burgess, by his excellent abridgment and translation of M. Reinaud's paper \"On the Periplus of the Erythrean Sea,\" has enabled many to study a very able essay, hitherto, in great measure, concealed from their view in vol. xxiv. of the \"Mem. de l'Acad. des Inscriptions.\" It is interesting to compare his views with those of Vincent and of the recent editor of the Greek text of \"Arrian,\" M. M\u00fcller. It is clear, that though \"Arrian\" incidentally corrects some of Ptolemy's errors, he was not himself acquainted with his work. The date M. Reinaud assigns (A.D. 246-7) to the Periplus is quite a hundred years later than has been urged by any other scholar, but the reasons he gives for this opinion are certainly cogent. He thinks, too, that the writer was the agent of a company, and the description he gives a compilation from many voyages. This paper will be found to be a useful supplement to McCrindle's translation of the Periplus, which was, as will be remembered, published in the \"Indian Antiquary.\"\n\nThere is, also, a translation, presumably by the Editor, of M. Stanislas Julien's account of different places in India,\nfrom \"Ma-tuan-lin's\" fragments of the great Chinese historians, no one of whom, however, had, probably, ever been there. Thien-chu, here used for India, is the same as the Shin-tu of the Han dynasty. Some important dates seem to be settled by it\u2014as, for instance, the Conquest of Western India by the Yuchi or Indo-Scythians, B.C. 26, their power lasting till A.D. 222, the time of the later Hans. The account of some of the journeys made is very curious.\n\nMr. Fleet contributes a short paper, \"On the Identification of a Western Chalukya Capital,\" \"Ettagiri,\" with the Yedagiri of the maps. Ettagiri was the name of one of the minor capitals of Vikramaditya. Mr. E. Thomas and Mr. Beal contribute papers on the \"Swastika\" and other Buddhist symbols, and show the wide range of country and period over which the \"Swastika\" is found; and the probability of its origin in connexion with the worship of the Sun, it being a sign of good luck, as its etymology implies. Mr. F. S. Growse, also, contributes a paper, \"On Balandshahr Antiquities,\" and Messrs. V. A. Smith and F. C. Black, \"On some Chandel Antiquities.\" Some other papers by Messrs. Fleet, Yule, Muir, Prof. M. Williams and others, will be noticed under their respective subjects.\n\nTo Mr. H. H. Howorth, F.S.A., we owe a paper (or rather the first portion of a paper) \"On Chinghiz Khan and his ancestors\"\u2014a subject which, from his recent researches, Mr. Howorth seems peculiarly well fitted to deal with; and to the Rev. W. Ayerst a very interesting one on \"The Garos.\" Mr. A. Constable adds a notice of \"James Wales, the Painter,\" whose works must be well known to many members of this Society. There is, also, a review of Babu Rajendra's \"Buddha Gaya,\" whence it appears that the compiler of this work has not succeeded in silencing adverse criticism;\u2014by Dr. Muir of H. Zimmer's \"Alt Indisches Leben,\" and of Miss Stokes's \"Indian Fairy Tales\" by Professor\nTawney. There is, also, an interesting paper by Mr. Logan on ancient pottery found in Malabar.\n\nMany valuable papers or essays have been contributed during the last year on the Archaeology of India, among which may be specified, in the *Athen\u00e6um*, a review of General Cunningham's \"St\u016bpa of Bharhut\" (Dec. 27), and a valuable note, announcing that Dr. E. M\u00fcller has completed the Archaeological Survey of Ceylon, commenced (under the auspices of Sir W. Gregory) by the late Dr. Goldschmidt, a portion of the notes referring to which has been printed by Mr. Burgess in the *Indian Antiquary*.\n\nIn the *Academy*, March 13, is a most important letter, from Mr. Burgess, \"On the Age of the Ajanta Caves,\" dated \"Ajanta Caves, Jan. 21, 1880,\" in which, it is hardly necessary to say, that he disagrees altogether from the views put forward by Babu Rajendra, and supports the judgment on this matter of Mr. Fergusson; (*ibid.* April 24), a notice, from the newly started periodical entitled \"Revue de l'histoire des Religions,\" of M. Spooner's account of the religious monuments of Cambodia; and, in May 15, a notice of three reprinted papers by Mr. Rivett-Carnac: 1. Archaeological notes on ancient sculpturing on rocks in Kumaon. 2. Prehistoric remains in Central India. 3. Rough notes on the Snake symbol in India, in connexion with the worship of Siva\u2014an attempt to show that snake worship is always connected with *linga* worship. In the Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology (Feb.), Mr. Hayter Lewis gives \"Some Remarks on Excavations made at Tel-el-Yehouda, near Cairo, and on some Antiquities brought thence and now in the British Museum.\" In the Calcutta Review (No. 138) is a good paper by C. H. B., \"On the Primitive Races of the Shahabad Plateau,\" and in the \"Annales de l'Extr\u00eame Orient\" (March) a letter from Dr. Harmand inclosing four drawings relating to Phallic worship. Lastly, while this Report is passing through the press, the\nGeneral Report for 1878-9, by Major-General Walker, C.B., of the \"Operations of the Survey of India, comprising the great Trigonometrical, the Topographical and the Revenue Surveys under the Government of India,\" has arrived. This report is full of the most valuable matter and contains many beautifully executed maps.\n\nImperial Gazetteer and Statistical Survey of India.\u2014As stated in the last Annual Report, these operations range themselves under two heads: first, the Statistical Survey of India, carried out district by district, with a view to the collecting of local materials; and, secondly, the Imperial Gazetteer, or the condensation of these materials into a concise alphabetical form. The Statistical Survey has now been completed in eleven out of fourteen Presidencies and Provinces of British India, and the results have been printed in ninety volumes, making about 30,000 pages. The Imperial Gazetteer has progressed rapidly during the last year. All the articles, exceeding 8000, have been compiled in manuscript; five volumes, in all containing 2818 pages, have been printed off, and others are passing through the press. The whole will comprise ten volumes, or about 5250 pages, and will be completed in 1881, that is, in exactly ten years from the commencement of the Statistical Survey by Dr. W. W. Hunter, the Director-General of Statistics, who has been throughout in charge of this work.\n\nGeneral Progress of Oriental Studies.\u2014Aryan Languages.\u2014Sanskrit.\u2014Several important papers or essays have been published on this subject during the last year, of which we may specify, in the Journal Asiatique (vol. xiii.), a paper by M. Rodet, \"Le\u00e7ons du Calcul d'Aryabh\u00e1ta,\" and in vol. xv. the commencement of a paper by M. S\u00e9naart, entitled \"Etude sur les Inscriptions de Piyadasi:\"\u2014in the Journal of the Germ. Orient. Society (vol. xxxiii.), M. Adolf Holtzmann, \"Die Apsaras nach dem Mahabharata;\"\u2014in vol. xxxiv. by Mr.\nAufrecht, a short paper on \"Eine seltene Verbalform;\" a review of Oldenberg's \"Vinayapitakam\" by Prof. Jacobi. In the R\u00e9publique Fran\u00e7. (June 20), M. Regnaud has printed \"L'Avenir des \u00e9tudes Sanskrites;\"\u2014and in the Revue Philosophique, \"Etudes de Philosophie Indienne, l'\u00e9cole Ved\u00e2nta.\"\n\nIn the Academy of July 5, is a long and able review by Professor F. Max M\u00fcller, of Kielhorn's \"Vy\u00e2carana Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2shya;\"\u2014ibid. (Sept. 13) by Rhys Davids of Prof. Jacobi's \"Kalpa S\u00fbtra of Bhadrab\u00e2hu.\" In the Transactions of the American Oriental Society (vol. x. pt. 2) are two elaborate papers, the first by Prof. Avery, entitled \"Contribution to the History of Vedic Inflexion;\"\u2014the second, by Mr. Lanman, called \"A Statistical Account of Noun-inflexion in the Veda:\" Prof. Whitney gives, also, \"Notes on certain Points in Sanskrit Grammar.\"\n\nIn the Berlin Monatsber. (June, 1879) Professor Weber has two articles, \"Ueber die Magavyakti des Krishna Dasa Mi\u00e7ra\"\u2014important essays on Mithraic worship, with reference, too, to the Indo-Scythic coins: and in the same, G. B\u00fchler has printed, \"Eine Notiz \u00fcber einige Sanskrit MSS. aus Ka\u00e7mir in der Hof Bibliothek zu Wien\";\u2014in Mem. de la Soc. de Linguistique, A. Barth has \"Formes irreguli\u00e8res dans le Bh\u00e2gavata Pur\u00e2na.\" In the Calcutta Review, Mr. A. E. Gough has continued his study of the \"Philosophy of the Upanishads.\"\n\nOn the subject of MSS. the most important matter seems to be the announcement by Mr. Goonetileke of Kandy of his discovery of a MS. called B\u00e2l\u00e2vabodhana, a reproduction of Chandra's Grammar by a Buddhist priest named K\u00e2\u015byapa, who lived in Ceylon about seven centuries ago. The MS. belongs to a Buddhist temple in the central province of the island, and is written in the Sinhalese character. Mr. Goonetileke proposes shortly to print it with the Devanagari alphabet.\n\nMr. A. C. Burnell has edited for the Madras Government a \"Classified Index of the Sanskrit MSS. in the Palace at\nTanjore,\u201d in three parts. Part I. containing: 1. Vedic Literature. 2. Modern Sanskrit Literature, including Grammar, Lexicography, Prosody, Rhetoric, Music, Dancing, etc., Architecture, Astronomy and Astrology. Part II. Philosophy. A. P\u016brvamim\u0101\u1e43s\u0101.

This work is well indexed, and, in the whole Catalogue, more than 12,000 MSS. are recorded with greater or less minuteness of detail.\n\nPart IV. has been issued of a \u201cCatalogue of the Sanskrit MSS. of the North-Western Provinces,\u201d Allahabad, 1879:\u2014and Nos. 13 and 14 (being vol. iv. pt. 2, and vol. v. pt. 1) of the \u201cNotices of Sanskrit MSS.\u201d by R\u0101jendralala Mitra, have also been published. In the Journ. Germ. Or. Soc. a list is given of the Sanskrit, Prakrit and other Indian MSS. belonging to Professor Jacobi at M\u00fcnster.\n\nThe following books may be mentioned as having been published more or less since the last Report was issued.\n\nBy Professor F. Max M\u00fcller, in his series of \u201cThe Sacred Books of the East,\u201d a volume containing Translations by himself of the Chh\u00e2ndogya Upanishad, of the Talavak\u0101ra Upanishad, of the Aitareya \u0100ranyaka, of the Kaushitaki Br\u0101hm\u0101\u1e47ya and of the V\u0101jasaneyi Br\u0101hm\u0101\u1e47ya Upanishad. This volume makes the first of the series.

In this curious work the author first discusses the references to kindred beliefs in the Vedic, Epic and general literature of India, and then gives a very complete abstract of the Vasantu R\u0101ja\u2019s writings.\n\nM. Foucaux has, also, published in the Bibliotheca\nExercitium, \"Vicentiusvagi: Itemae en cinq actes de Kali-\ndasa.\" F. Zollmann has brought out at Leipzig a scholarly\nedition of the drama \"Mahavira and Agnimitra:\"\u2014Dr.\nBengtson has added to the valuable labours he carried out\nwith Mr. Koch, some years since, in what is known as the\ngreat St. Petersburg Sanskrit Dictionary.\u2014the true treasures\nof Sanskrit\u2014a new and combined dictionary; which is,\nindeed, not only more than a mere abridgment, but a most\nimportant supplement of the former, in that all the addenda\nand corrigenda of the former are now incorporated into the\nnew Dictionary. It is to be hoped that an English transla-\ntion of this most useful work, now in contemplation, will be\nsoon accomplished. Mr. Annamachan Baramah has issued a\nsecond volume of his \"Practical English and Sanskrit\nDictionary,\" but this does not, as was anticipated, complete\nthe work, as it only carries it as far as the word \"oyster.\" The\nauthor has added to this second volume of his Dictionary a\nsupplementary chapter on what he calls \"Higher Sanskrit\nGrammar,\" or gender and syntax\u2014of nearly 500 pages.\nThe collection of rules and illustrations he has given will be\nhighly appreciated by those who have to teach Sanskrit; but\nit is to be regretted that he has not thought it necessary to\ngive more complete authorities for his various statements. To\nsay that a word has this or that meaning in Manu or P\u0101\u1e47ini\nor S\u0101yana is scarcely enough, without the chapter or the\nverse where it occurs. Professor Weber has completed the\nthird volume of his \"Indische Streifen,\" being reviews of\ncurrent Sanskrit, Pali and Prakrit literature, with an index\nof forty-six closely-printed three-column pages for reference\nto the three volumes, and a clasped bibliographical table of\ncontents. The number of authors mentioned or criticized\nin this third volume is about 350. His \"History of Indian\nLiterature\" has been translated by Messrs. Mann and Zachariae.\nProfessor Adolf has also published the second part of his \"Rig-\nVeda, die \u00e4lteste literatur der Inder, ein Wissenschaftliche\nbeilage zum Programm der Kantonschule.\"\nThe literary remains of Dr. Goldst\u00fccker have also been published in two vols.; the first containing the Veda (for Knight's Encyclop\u00e6dia Metropolitana, 1860), and contributions to Chambers' Encyclop\u00e6dia. 2. The Religious Difficulties in India;\u2014The Inspired Writings of Hinduism;\u2014Hindu Epic Poetry, the Mahabharata;\u2014The Deficiencies in the Present Administration of Hindu Law;\u2014Opinion on Privy Council Law Cases;\u2014On the Question whether the Law of Bengal favours or discountenances the Principle of Perpetuity as applicable to the Right of Inheritance;\u2014On the Etymology of Jecur, Stercus, etc. Professor Gedicke has printed at Breslau \"Der Accusativ in Veda,\" the concluding volume of a series of works on the declension of nouns in Sanskrit:\u2014Mr. Palmer Boyd [Sanskrit Scholar, Trin. Coll. Camb.] has translated into English prose \"Nagananda, or the Joy of the Snake World,\" from the Sanskrit of Sri Harsha Deva. In the Bombay Sanskrit Series, No. XVI., has been published the Vikramorva\u015biyam, a Drama in five Acts by Kalidasa, edited by Shankar Pandurang Pandit, M.A.;\u2014M. Felix N\u00e9ve has published, \"Le Denouement de l'Histoire de Rama, (Outtara-Rama-Charita), drame de Bhavabouti;\"\u2014and Professor Monier Williams \"Nalop\u0101khy\u0101nam, the Story of Nala, an Episode of the Mahabharata; the Sanskrit text with a copious vocabulary and an improved version of Dean Milman's Translation.\" Of the Bibliotheca Indica the following parts have come out in sequence: Sanhita of the Black Yajur Veda, fasc. xxxi.;\u2014Gobhiliya Grihya S\u016btra, fasc. x.;\u2014Chaturvarga Chint\u0101mani, vol. 2, pt. 2, fasc. x. xi. xii.;\u2014V\u0101yu Pur\u0101\u1e47a, fasc. ii. iii. iv.;\u2014Bh\u0101mati, fasc. vii.;\u2014Prithiraja Rasau, pt. 2, fasc. iii.\n\nIt may be added that on the 12th of Sept. last the veteran scholar of Breslau, Prof. A. F. Stenzler, attained the fiftieth year of his Doctorate, which he had originally obtained through Prof. Bopp; at the same time receiving a printed congratulatory address from the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences;\nand that the young Maharaja of Udaipur, the acknowledged head of the Princes of Rajputana, has ordered that all official business in his principality shall in future be conducted in Sanskrit.\n\nA recent number of Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner's \"Record\" contains an earnest appeal from Prof. Albrecht Weber for the constitution of a \"Sanskrit Text Fund,\" to take the place of the now moribund, if not dead, \"Sanskrit Text Society.\" It is to be hoped that his proposal may be successfully carried out, as no country has so large an interest as England in everything connected with Indian literature. The Saddarshana Chintanik\u00e0 continues to come out at regular intervals.\n\nFor Prakrit we have by Dr. G. B\u00fchler, \"Dhanapala's Paiyalachchi N\u0101mam\u0101l\u0101,\" a Prakrit Ko\u015ba, edited with critical notes, introduction and glossary, and in the Journ. Germ. Or. Soc. xxxiii. 3, J. Klatt's \"Dhanapala Rishabha pancacika,\" of interest as referring to Jaina worship. Prof. R. Pischel also has completed his edition of Hemachandra's grammar; further, Prof. Goldschmidt has published \"R\u0101vanavaha oder Setubandha, Prakrit und Deutsch,\" part I, Strassb. 1880. The Introduction gives an account of the MS. sources made use of; and the Index, which was chiefly compiled by the late Paul Goldschmidt, who in 1873 published \"Specimen des Setubandha,\" is a most valuable aid to Prakrit etymology. The second portion, containing the German translation and commentary, is in the press. Dr. S. Warren has printed at Amsterdam the Niray\u0101vatiy\u0101 Suttam, the text being Jaina Prakrit, with notes and glossary to the five Jaina Upangas forming the above Sutta, and containing a legend of Bimbis\u0101ra and Aj\u0101tasattu, a Jataka story by Mahavira; together with several short Avad\u0101nas or legends of Jain Saints. The text has been carefully edited from four MSS., but has not yet been translated.\nPali.\u2014Dr. Oldenberg has published the Dipavansa, an ancient Buddhist historical record, the forthcoming of which was announced last year; of his other publication, the Viniyapitakam, the first volume of which has been well reviewed in the Athen. of Aug. 16, a second one has appeared. Also the second vol. of the Jataka and its Commentary, edited by Prof. Fausb\u00f6ll, has been published. The Viniyapitakam is chiefly valuable for the Ecclesiastical History it gives of the Buddhist Church, of the conversion of the Ceylonese to the Buddhist faith, and for many details of the ancient history of Ceylon. Professor Pischel of Kiel has edited and translated the Assalayana Suttam, a Pali Sutta, the ninety-third Sutta in the second portion of the Majjhima Nikaya. It describes how the Brahmans, irritated by the promulgation of Gautama's doctrine of the equality of castes, persuaded Assalayana, a young and distinguished scholar, to undertake to overthrow Buddha's arguments\u2014the result being that he was defeated and became a convert himself to Buddha's views. Reference is made to the state of things existing among the Yonas and Kambojas\u2014that is, among the inhabitants of what is now called Afghanistan. If, as seems probable, the Yonas of this passage are the Bactrian Greeks, the date when the sutta assumed its present form cannot be earlier than the third century B.C. There is a careful notice of this brochure by M. S\u00e9nart in the Revue Critique, for April 12. Mr. James Gray has printed the Ajjhata-Jaya-Mangalam (the Pali text in Burmese characters), with vocabulary, grammatical notes, translations and examination questions; and Mr. Rhys Davids has given in the \"Contemporary,\" for Dec. 1, \"Buddha's First Sermon.\" The same scholar has recently read at the Royal Institution three lectures on Buddhism.\n\nHindustani.\u2014Dr. Fallon may be congratulated on having brought to a satisfactory completion his valuable Dictionary in 25 parts and 1216 pages. He is now engaged on the\npreparation of two companion works. The first, a new English and Hindustani Dictionary, and the second, a volume of Hindustani Proverbs. He is, also, about to bring out a new edition of his English and Hindustani Law and Commercial Dictionary. Dr. Leitner (as Officiating Director of Public Instruction in the Punjab) has brought out a \"Vocabulary of Technical Terms in the Elementary Vernacular School-books,\" in Hindustani and English\u2014and proposes to issue them, somewhat later, in a more complete form. Major W. R. M. Holroyd has edited Talim al Mubtadi\u2014an Urdu edition of the Indian Vernacular Series for Elementary Schools\u2014under the titles of First and Second Readers. These books have been drawn up by Mr. Kipling, the Principal of the Mayo School of Art at Lahore. Mr. Baness has published a Text Book for the Lower Standard Examination in Hindustani.\n\nBengali.\u2014Ram Das Sen has published the third part of his \"Aitih\u0101sika Rahasya,\" or Essays on history, philosophy, arts, and sciences of Ancient India, the table of contents of which shows a remarkable variety of subjects treated of:\u2014Babu Doorga Narain Ghosh, \"Shailesh-Nanth,\" an Upanyash:\u2014R. G. Ghose, \"The Chhinna Masta:\"\u2014Bankim Chattopadhyaya, \"Krishna Kant's Will:\"\u2014Haris Chandra Sarkar, \"Dukhini,\" pt. 1:\u2014Amvika Charan Rakshit, \"Bharata Bhaishajya Tattwa,\" or a Handbook of Materia Medica and Therapeutics on Indian Drugs\u2014a valuable work admirably carried out. The resuscitation of Indian Medical Science is a noble and a useful labour, to be accomplished successfully only by educated and professional Hindoos: to the Baboo Amvika Charan Rakshit, therefore, the thanks of the profession and of the public are fully due:\u2014Chintamani Manjari, \"Ascharye Manjari,\" that is, the wonderful story of a parrot:\u2014Chandra Bhusan Majumdar, \"Ratna-Garbh\u0101,\" a drama:\u2014the author of Puru-vikram and Sarojini Natakas, \"Asrumati Nataka,\" a very interesting drama:\u2014Bankim Chandra\nChattopadhaya, \"Prabandha Pustaka,\" a collection of essays reprinted from the Banga Darsana:\u2014Lakshmi Narain Chakravarti, \"Nandavansoch'cheda\"\u2014an Aupanyasika N\u0101taka:\u2014the same, \"Ananda K\u0101nana: N\u0101tya-R\u016bpaka,\" 2nd edit.:\u2014Sriram Palit, \"Prakriti Tattwa,\" a treatise on Natural Philosophy. It may be added, in conclusion, that the Koran is being translated into Bengali by Rajendra Nath Datta, and that parts 1 and 2 have been published.\n\nHindi.\u2014We have a notice in the Proc. Beng. As. Soc. of the Dristo-kutu by Sur Das:\u2014and, in the same Journal, of a collection of Hindi Roots made by Mr. Hoernle:\u2014in the Sitz. ber. d. Munich Acad. d. Wiss., a paper by Trumpp, entitled Die \u00e4ltesten Hindui-gedichte. Mr. Hoernle has also published \"A Comparative Grammar of the Gaudian Languages,\" with especial reference to the Eastern form of Hindi. This book is accompanied by a language-map and table of alphabets.\n\nSindhi.\u2014A Sindhi and English Dictionary, by Mr. Udharam Thevardes and Mr. S. F. Mirza, B.A., has been edited by the Rev. George Shirt, M.A., M.R.A.S. (Kurrachee, 8vo. 1879).\n\nPushtu.\u2014The Rev. T. G. L. Meyer has translated the Psalms, and the Gospels of St. Matthew and St. Mark into Pushtu. Major H. G. Raverty has also brought out a Pushtu Manual;\u2014and M. E. J. Dillon, \"L'Alphabet de la Langue Bactrienne.\"\n\nGujarathi.\u2014In the Journal of the National Indian Association is a paper by N. J. Ratnagar \"On the Popular Poets of Gujarat.\"\n\nMarathi.\u2014In the Indian Antiquary for Feb. 1880, is an interesting record by Mr. Telang of the Kavyeti Sangraha\u2014\na collection of poetical and historical pieces in this language, which has been recently brought together and published.\n\nFor Sinhalese we have to record a paper by E. Kuhn, \"\u00dcber den \u00e4ltesten Arischen Bestandtheil des Singhalischen Wortschatzes,\" in the Monatsber. der M\u00fcnch. Acad. d. Wiss.\n\nTibetan.\u2014The Abb\u00e9 Des-Godins has given in the \"Annales de l'Extr\u00eame Orient\" some valuable ethnographical notes on Tibet\u2014and a letter from Yer-ka-lo in that country in reply to the views that have been put forth by M. L. Dussieux and M. Garnier. The same journal prints \"Expos\u00e9 sommaire de la Mission du Thibet,\" with a well-executed map of the country. We further learn from the Director of Public Instruction in Bengal, that all the works in Tibetan in the Library of the Asiatic Society of Bengal have been catalogued, and that this Catalogue is now ready.\n\nAmong Miscellaneous Indian or Oriental, the following papers or books may be mentioned:\u2014in the Athen\u00e6um, a long and interesting paper by Professor Monier Williams on \"Indian Theism,\" and on the entrance, as a member of the University of Oxford, of Sy\u0101maji Krishna Varma, \"the first real Indian Pandit who has ever visited England,\" member of the Arya-Samaj (June 7):\u2014a review of H. G. Keene's \"The Turks in India, critical chapters on the administration of that country by Chagatai B\u00e1bar and his descendants\" (July 26):\u2014of the \"Abstract of the Surveys and of other Geographical Operations in India, 1877\u20138\" (Dec. 20):\u2014a curious paper by Dr. Birdwood \"On the so-called Custard Apple of the Ajanta Cave Paintings, and the Bharhut Sculptures\" (Jan. 17, 1880):\u2014and a review of \"The Literary Remains of the late Professor Theodore Goldst\u00fccker\" (April 10). In the Academy, an able review by J. S. Cotton of the \"Report of the Miscellaneous old Records of the India Office\" (July\nand, by Mr. A. C. Burnell, an excellent review of Professor F. Max M\u00fcller's Sacred Books of the East, vol. 1, The Upanishads (Aug. 9). Professor Monier Williams has also contributed two essays to the Contemporary Review, August and December, entitled respectively \"Indian Religious Thought\" and \"Buddhism and Jainism.\"\n\nIn the Calcutta Review are the following papers: by C. Pearson, \"Primary Education in India:\"\u2014by H. G. Keene, \"India's Place in Human Evolution;\" on \"Rural Life in the North of India\u2014on the Social Life of the Aryas, together with a Review of Professor Weber's Indian History.\" There are, also, good notices of the new edition of Ravenshaw's Gaur, of the Rajkumar Colleges, and of Mr. G. S. Leonard's History of the Brahma Somaj. The following books may be mentioned:\u2014General Report on the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India, with a Special Report from E. C. Lyall, On the hill lands of Kumaon. The Geological Survey for India, by H. B. Medlicott, M.A., and W. F. Blanford, F.R.S.:\u2014Paleontologia Indica, Series iv., pt. 3; Memoirs, vol. xv.; Records, vol. xii. pts. 1, 2, 3. A. Barth, \"Les Religions de l'Inde:\"\u2014Rev. M. A. Sherring, Hindu Tribes and Castes, together with an Account of the Muhammedan Tribes of the N.W. Frontier, and of the Aboriginal Tribes of the Central Provinces:\u2014and, by W. W. Hunter, Statistical Account of Assam, 2 vols. Professor Monier Williams has issued a third edition of \"Modern India and the Indians.\" It is, further, stated that some of the many works or papers the late Mr. Alwis left behind him are being prepared for publication, a second edition of the Sidat Sangarava being nearly ready, as also the greater part of the Vinaya Pitaka, the first division of the Buddhist Canon, with a translation; and the Pali text of Attanagaluwana. Mr. Rhys Davids' work on the Buddhist Jataka Tales is nearly ready; and Mr. Trenckner's edition of the Pali text of the\nMilinda Pasha\u2014a series of discussions between the Greek king Menander and the Buddhist priest N\u0101gasena, which ended in Menander's conversion\u2014will soon be ready for publication. Mr. Trenckner proposes, after this, to devote himself to an edition of the Majjhima Nik\u0101ya. M. Emil Schlagintweit is issuing in thirty-five folio Nos., \"Indien in wort und bild, eine schilderung des Indischen Kaiser-reichs:\"\u2014M. Barth has reprinted from the \"Encyclop\u00e9die des Sciences Religieuses\" his essay \"Sur les Religions de l'Inde:\"\u2014and Bishop Bigandet's \"Life and Legend of Gaudama, the Buddha of the Burmese,\" has been translated into English and published in two vols.:\u2014Dr. A. Hillebrandt has printed \"Das Alt-Indische Neu und Volmonds-opfer in seiner einfachsten Form:\"\u2014M. Lefmann, \"Geschichte des Alten Indiens,\" part I, with plates and maps. We learn further that Major Biddulph, who has been for some time stationed on the boundary of Kashmir, has prepared a report on the customs and languages of the peoples with whom he has been living\u2014a race possibly a survival of the earliest Aryan races. Dr. Bellew has, also, been examining the S.W. of Dardistan.\n\nNon-Aryan Languages of India.\u2014Mr. J. Lazarus has published a Tamil Grammar, \"designed for the use of Colleges and Schools,\" and in the \"Indian Antiquary,\" in the months respectively of July, November and December, Mr. Cole has given \"Words and Phrases with Santali Equivalents;\" Mr. Pope, \"Notes on the Kurrall;\" and Lieut. R. C. Temple, \"Notes on the Mengale Thok.\"\n\nMr. A. H. Arden (of Christ's College, Cambridge) has, also, printed, \"A Companion Telugu Reader\" to his \"Progressive Telugu Grammar.\"\n\nIndian Institute.\u2014The Council are glad to learn that the energetic labours of Professor Monier Williams on behalf of this Institution have been so far successful during the last year,\nthat the University of Oxford has granted a site whereon to build it, at the same time giving him permission to publish the scheme for the Constitution of the Institute. About \u00a317,000 have now been subscribed, of which \u00a312,000 has been actually invested. The new Viceroy of India and the new Secretary of State for India have been added to the list of subscribers. It is supposed that about \u00a310,000 will be required for the building and \u00a31000 for the interior fittings, and it is to be hoped that the University may hereafter be willing to give an annual grant for efficient maintenance.\n\nFurther India and Malayo-Polynesia.\u2014The publication of the very useful work entitled \"Annales de l'Extr\u00eame Orient,\" which is issued with great regularity every month, enables us to furnish a more complete outline of what has been done or is doing, than would otherwise have been possible. The following are some of the more important papers published in this periodical:\u2014Dr. Harmand, Consid\u00e9rations sur les monuments des Kmers, in \"Notes de Voyage en Indo-Chine,\" which are well worth careful reading:\u2014\"Une Revolution de Palais \u00e0 Malaka (A.D. 1331), Episode de l'Histoire des Rois Malais de Malaka, Extr. du Per-ator-an-Sagala Radja Radja,\" by A. Marr\u00e9;\u2014M. Vossion, \"Sur la Birmanie,\" a paper of great interest for the notice given therein of the different races living in the valley of the Irawaddy:\u2014On the honorific orders in Siam, \"The White Elephant of Siam:\"\u2014A Ravel, \"Sur l'Organisation de la Famille Hindoue:\"\u2014\"Asie, Chronique G\u00e9ographique\"\u2014interesting as showing that Mr. Gill has accomplished that which Mr. Margary lost his life in attempting:\u2014Notice par Dr. Harmand, \"Le Laos et les Populations sauvages de l'Indo-Chine:\"\u2014\"L'Annam et les Annamites,\" par J. L. Detruel de Rhins:\u2014\"Le Royaume de Siam,\" par M. Amed\u00e9e Gr\u00e9han:\u2014\"Le Lac Toba au Pays des Battaks,\" by E. J. Sillem:\u2014A Collection of very interesting official documents referring to \"La D\u00e9couverte de la voie Commerciale du\nS. O. de la Chine,\" par MM. J. Dondelet de La Gr\u00e9e, G. Eug\u00e8ne Simon, et J. Dupuis. M. A. Bruyn of Ternate offers some curious notes on the Karons, Kebars, and Amerbaks of New Guinea, who have been scarcely noticed before, and are all cannibals, together with a list of the numerals and a few words he picked up.\u2014M. Foncin, also, gives a few notes on Polynesia. We learn too that H. Van Eck, Professor at Breda, has published a Malay Grammar, which was ably reviewed by Klinkert in \"De Indische Gids\" for 1880, p. 498ff. P. Jansz's Javanese Grammar has appeared at Samarang in a third and enlarged edition. The peculiar Malay dialect spoken at Atjeh is the subject of an article by J. Dias in the Journ. As. Soc. of Batavia, vol. xxiv. and of a separate publication by P. Arriens, Amsterdam, 1880. Specimens of the Malay dialect of Western Sumatra are given by J. Habbema in the Journ. As. Soc. of Batavia, vol. xxv. The same vol. further contains a collection of Menang-kabau proverbs, and other specimens of that dialect and of the one spoken in the district of Padang; a vocabulary of the languages spoken at Enggano, Mentawei and Nias, and contributions to Kawi lexicography. Besides these may be mentioned, an important article by Mr. H. G. Keene of Delhi, \"On the Relations of the Indo-Chinese and the Inter-Oceanic Tribes and Races,\" in the Anthrop. Journ. Feb. 1880;\u2014and, in the Academy, June 7, a review of J. L. Detruel de Rhins' \"Le Royaume d'Annam et les Annamites.\"\u2014From the same Journal we learn that Count Meyners d'Estr\u00e9e is engaged on a work to be called \"La Papouasie ou Nouvelle Guin\u00e9e occidentale et ses habitants.\"\n\nIn the Bulletin de la Soc. G\u00e9ogr. is a very complete summary, by M. Detruel de Rhins, entitled \"R\u00e9sum\u00e9 des Travaux G\u00e9ographiques sur l'Indo-Chine Orientale,\"\u2014and a notice \"Sur Le Tong King,\" by M. Romanet du Caillaud. We learn, also, from the same source that M. Mikloukhomaklay has been placed at the head of the Anglo-Dutch\nexploring party for New Guinea. It may be added that a new edition has been published of Taberd's Annamite Dictionary:\u2014that the British and Foreign Bible Society are printing the Old Testament in Aneityumese, the language of the most southerly of the New Hebrides group, under the superintendence of the Rev. J. Inglis, the islanders themselves having already collected \u00a3700 for the New Testament, the Psalms and the first half of the Pentateuch:\u2014that M. Violette has published a \"Dictionnaire Samoa-Fran\u00e7aise-Anglais et Franc.-Angl.-Samoa,\" with a grammar of the language:\u2014and that a translation has been issued, in two volumes, by M. Tr\u00fcbner, of Bp. Bigandet's \"Life and Legend of Gautama, the Buddha of the Burmese, with Annotations, the Ways to Neibban, and a Notice of the Phongyies or Burmese Monks.\" In the American Geographical Society's Journal, vol. viii. is a paper by M. d'Abain, \"On the Kingdom of Cambodia,\" while a most valuable work has been printed separately by M. Delaporte embracing the whole of this subject under the title \"Voyage au Cambodge\u2014L'Architecture Khmer.\"\n\nChina Review.\u2014This publication, as usual, presents for the past year a varied collection of papers\u2014some of them in completion of those begun in previous numbers, while others have a special value for the philological or historical views set forth in them. Thus, in vol. vii. pt. 5, \"Legislation and Law in Ancient China\" is continued; as are, also, Mr. McIntyre's paper, \"Jottings from the Book of Rites;\" and Mr. A. B. Hutchinson's \"Critical Disquisitions of Wang Ch'ung;\"\u2014Mr. F. S. A. Bourne gives a valuable \"Historical Table of the High Officials composing the Central and Provincial Governments of China,\" a paper of obvious value, as there does not at present exist any work in a western language to which reference can be made when a question arises as to the history of men and of events in China, since the Treaty of 1860. The Chinese do not write biographies of living states-\nmen; and there is no publication in Chinese giving the posts that a man has held previously to his present appointment. It should be added that this work was projected by the late Mr. W. F. Mayers, who intended, had his life been spared, to have compiled a very full record of the principal metropolitan and provincial officials. It cannot be doubted that such a work, from the pen of so learned and accurate a student as was Mr. Mayers, would have been of the highest value and importance to those whose duty it is to look after the interests of their countrymen in a foreign land, and the knowledge of his opponent's antecedents is certainly a useful part of a diplomatist's equipment. In the same part is a paper signed V. W. X., which deals with some severity with a former paper by Mr. Kingsmill, \"On the Shi-King.\" Then follow short notices of new books, the chief value of the larger portion of which will be for those who have or have had actual personal experience of China and of the Chinese. The most important of these is a review of M. Cordier's famous work, the \"Bibliotheca Sinica,\" the first two fasciculi of the first volume of which are now out. It should be added that Mr. G. M. H. Playfair gives a brief vocabulary of the dialect of Formosa, with a translation of four songs.\n\nIn vol. vii. pt. 6, are continuations of \"Jottings from the Book of Rites,\" of \"Translations from Chinese School Books,\" of \"Ballads of the Shi-King,\" of \"The Critical Disquisitions of Wang Ch'ung,\" of \"Brief Sketches from the Life of K'ung-ming,\" and of \"Ethnological Sketches from the Dawn of History.\" Besides these, Dr. Eitel contributes a paper entitled \"Chinese Philosophy before Confucius,\" the chief point of which is the demonstration of the difference between the West and China, in this particular, that, if it be true that the \"history of European philosophy is the emancipation of philosophy from theology\" (as Mr. G. H. Lewes held), in China, on the other hand, it is quite different, as, there, Religion has not developed any system of Philosophy\n\u2014while Philosophy, on the other hand, has never set itself in antagonism with the religious instincts or creeds of the people.\u2014Mr. E. L. Oxenham adds, \"A Chip from Chinese History, or the last two Emperors of the great Sung Dynasty, A.D. 1101\u20131126.\"\u2014In the notices of books is one of a useful compilation by the Catholic Missionary P. Angelo Zottoli, entitled \"Cursus Literaturae Sinicae\"\u2014with the Chinese and Latin on opposite pages\u2014two volumes of which are already published; and a notice of the 7th vol. of the Translation of the Peking Gazette. To this is added, a notice by Mr. G. Phillips of the \"Supposed Mention in Chinese History of the Nestorian Missions to China in the Seventh and Eighth Centuries;\" and a list by Mr. E. H. Parker of \"New Foochow Colloquial Words,\" being additions to the well-known Dictionary of Messrs. Baldwin and Maclean; there is, also a very curious notice of the \"Kitchen-God.\"\n\nIn vol. viii. pt. 1, are continuations of \"Translations from Chinese School Books,\" of \"Ballads of the Shi-King,\" of \"The Critical Disquisitions of Wang Ch'ung,\" and of \"Brief Sketches of the Life of K'ung-ming.\" Mr. Jamieson gives, also, \"Translations from the Lu-li\u2014or General Code of Laws,\" which, as it was completed only two years ago (1877), may be fairly considered to represent the general law of China. In this, the word Lu indicates the fundamental or primary framework, into which the Li, or subsequent enactments, are interwoven. Mr. E. H. Parker adds further notes on \"New Cantonese Words,\" and Mr. Phillips gives some additional and important illustrations to his previous article on \"The Nestorians at Canton.\" There is also a valuable, but anonymous paper, \"On the Korean Pronunciation of Chinese.\" Among the miscellaneous notices of books (some very miscellaneous) is a review of Dr. Legge's \"Sacred Books of the Chinese,\" which forms the third volume of Prof. Max M\u00fcller's edition of the Sacred Books of the East; and an important\narticle by Dr. S. W. Bushell on \"A Terra-cotta Vase with a supposed Chinese Inscription discovered by Dr. Schliemann at Hisarlik,\" in which he shows that while there is no ground for the supposition or suggestion of M. Emile Buret; on the other hand, that Mr. Sayce's judgment in this matter is probably correct.\n\nVol. viii. pt. 2, contains the continuation of \"Brief Sketches from the Life of K'ung-ming,\" and two articles of unusual merit, that by E. H. Parker, \"On Comparative Chinese Family Law,\" and that by T. Watters, \"On Fa-Hsien and his English Translators.\" In the first Mr. Parker shows that the Chinese Customary Law rests, as did the earliest Roman Law, on the \"Mores Majorum\"\u2014or \"customs long observed and sanctioned by the consent of the people.\" It seems probable that the Chinese have made very few changes, indeed, in their fundamental social principles, since the 12th century A.D. Among the notices of books is one of some value by M. Theoph. Piret, \"Le Saint Edit, \u00e9tude de Literature Chinoise.\"\n\nVol. viii. No. 3, contains continuations of Mr. Watters, \"Fa-Hsien and his English Translators;\" of \"The Ballads of the Shi-King;\" of \"Translations of Chinese School Books;\" of F. Hirth's \"Notes on Chinese Grammar,\" and of Mr. Oxenham's \"Chips from Chinese History.\" There is also a short notice by Mr. H. J. Allen of \"The Lewchew Islands\" [other brief notices of these islands will be found in the Annales de l'Extr\u00eame Orient]: an important study of the Corean Language by Mr. McIntyre\u2014in which he shows that Corean (though, of course, not so rich, and, at the same time, largely indebted to Chinese) is really perfect in itself. Mr. Kingsmill contributes a paper \"On Ancient Geographical Names in Central Asia,\" some of the proposed identifications in which are ingenious. As usual, there are some excellent short notices of books, as, for instance, one of Mr. Watters' \"Guide to the Tablets in a Temple of Confucius,\" and another of\nMr. Acheson's \"Index to Dr. Williams' Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language.\"\n\nIn vol. viii. pt. 4, are continuations of \"Translations from the Lu-li, or General Code of Laws of the Chinese Empire,\" by G. Jamieson; of \"Fa-Hsien and his English Translators\" by T. Watterson; and of \"Notes on the Corean Language\" by J. McIntyre. Mr. E. H. Parker contributes a Syllabary of the Hakka Language or Dialect. There are also notices of an essay by Mr. Alabaster entitled \"Occasional Papers on Chinese Philosophy, No. vi. The Chinese Bible;\" of the Rev. Ernest Faber's \"Introduction to the Science of Chinese Religion, a critique on Professor Max M\u00fcller and other writers;\" of \"Memoires concernant l'Histoire naturelle de l'Empire Chinois;\" and of \"Erh-Tou-Mei, ou les pruniers merveilleux\u2014Roman Chinois,\" traduit par A. T. Piry.\n\nIn the Journal of North China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, No. xii., are papers by the late W. F. Mayers, \"On the Stone Figures at Chinese Tombs and Offering of Living Sacrifices;\" E. H. Parker, \"Comparative Study of Chinese Dialects;\" and T. W. Kingsmill, \"On the Ancient Language and Cult of the Chows, being notes critical and exegetical on the Shi-King\u2014or Classic of the Poetry of the Chinese.\" In Part xiii. is one by P. G. von Mollendorff, \"On the Family Law of the Chinese, and its comparative relations to that of other nations.\"\n\nBesides the papers, etc., just referred to, as in the China Review, etc., there are a considerable number of others scattered through various well-known Journals, together with several independently printed books. To each of these classes, brief reference will now be made.\n\n1. Papers, Essays or Letters.\u2014Thus, in the Athen\u00e6um, are reviews of H. A. Giles's \"Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio\"\u2014the title of which ought to have been \"Liao-chai's\nStrange Stories;\"\u2014of Prof. R. K. Douglas's \"Confucianism and Taoism,\" published by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge;\u2014of the second fasciculus of the first volume of Cordier's Bibliotheca Sinica, which is chiefly devoted to works on the Religions of China. In the Academy are: review, by Prof. Douglas, of Dr. Legge's \"Sacred Books of China; the Texts of Confucianism; Part I. The Shu King; the Religious Portions of the Shih King; the Hsiao King;\" forming the third volume of Prof. F. Max M\u00fcller's \"Sacred Books of the East;\" a review, by the same, of E. J. Eitel's \"Chinese Dictionary in the Cantonese Dialect. Part II. K\u2014M:\"\u2014and, by Dr. Legge, of Prof. R. K. Douglas's \"Confucianism and Taoism;\"\u2014together with an interesting letter by Dr. Edkins from Peking (Aug. 9). In the Trans. Germ. Orient. Soc. xxxiii. 3, is a paper entitled \"Bezeichnungen der Farben blau und gr\u00fcn in Chinesischen altenthum,\" by M. Victor Strauss und Torney. In the Journal Asiatique, M. Huart has given a paper entitled \"Chronique Litt\u00e9raire de l'Extr\u00eame Orient,\" in which he reviews Mr. Giles's \"Glossary of Reference on Subjects connected with the Far East;\"\u2014M. G. von Gabelenz's \"Geschichte d. Chinesischen Grammatiken,\" etc.;\u2014Mr. Eitel's \"Chinese Dictionary of the Cantonese Dialect;\"\u2014Rev. J. Chalmers' \"English and Cantonese Pocket Dictionary;\"\u2014Mr. MacGregor's \"History of the Laws, etc., of China;\"\u2014Mr. H. A. Giles' \"History of Koolangsu;\"\u2014Rev. Mr. Fleming's \"Our Mission to the East;\"\u2014Mr. G. C. Stent's \"Chinese and English Vocabulary in the Pekingese Dialect;\"\u2014G. H. M. Playfair's \"Geographical Dictionary of China;\"\u2014and an Index to Dr. Wells Williams's Syllabic Dictionary according to the Orthography of Sir Thomas Wade. In vol. xiv. M. Huart reviews the translation of \"Woolsey's International Law\" into Chinese by students of the Imperial Tung-ouen College, under the superintendence of Dr. W. A. Martin, who, himself, some thirteen years ago, translated Wheaton's work\non the same subject; and in vol. xv. M. Huart notices other recent works, such as Mr. Giles's pamphlet \"On some Translations and Mistra1sations;\"\u2014by Dr. Wells Williams, Gonsalves' Lexicon Manuale Latino-Sinicum, Janetet's l'Epigraphie Chinoise au Tibet, and Mollendorff's Family Law of the Chinese. M. Huart contributes, also, to the Numbers for Oct. Nov. Dec. 1879, an interesting \"Memoire sur les Guerres des Chinois contre les Coreens de 1618 \u00e0 1637, d'apres les documents Chinois.\"\n\nIn the Acad. d. Inscriptions for June 6, the Marquis Hervey de St. Denis read a curious paper by a young Swedish Sinologue, M. Strindberg, on the relations between Sweden and China and the Tatar countries from the middle of the 17th century to the present day in which, inter alia, M. Strindberg points out that the first tea-plant was brought to Europe by a Swedish officer. Mr. Axon has contributed two papers to the \"Library Journal\" on Chinese Libraries; and Mr. Giles a paper to the \"Nineteenth Century,\" \"On the Book-languages of China,\" and to the Cornhill Magazine, \"On Cremation in China.\" Other papers that may be noted are: J. Chalmers, \"On Chinese Natural Theology,\" Congres de St. Petersb. vol. ii.:\u2014E. J. Eitel, \"Outlines of a History of Chinese Philosophy,\" ibid.:\u2014A. Wylie, \"The Mongol Astronomical Instruments in Peking,\" ibid.:\u2014A. Desprez, \"La Chine au xxiiie Si\u00e8cle\" (Republique, Mai):\u2014Sir W. Medhurst, \"On Chinese Poetry,\" in Macmillan's Magazine:\u2014G. E. Moule, \"Tone and other Characteristics of Chinese\" (Jour. of Philology, vol. viii. No. 16):\u2014S. Wells Williams, \"On China, the Country and People\" (Amer. Geogr. Soc. viii.): and \"Female Education and Authors in China,\" by the same (New Englander).\n\nOther noticeable books are, H. A. Giles, \"Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio,\" which has been reviewed, as noticed above, in the Athenaeum, and, also, in the Monatsber. f. d. Orient (Feb. 1880):\u2014A. T. Piry, \"La Saint Edit, Etude\nsur la Litterature Chinoise,\" a translation in French, made for the use of students in the College at Peking for the teaching of European languages:\u2014the publication of the translation by Dr. Legge of \"The Sacred Books of the Chinese; the Texts of Confucianism, Part I. the Sh\u00fb King; the Religious Portions of the Shih King; the Hsi\u00e2o King;\" forming the third volume of Professor F. Max M\u00fcller's \"Sacred Books of the East;\"\u2014Rev. J. W. Wiley, \"Record of Observations made during many years residence in China and Japan, and of a tour of official visitation to the Missions in both Countries in 1877\u20138;\"\u2014The Gospel of St. John translated into Hangchow for the use of the C. M. S.'s Mission at Hangchow:\u2014Shi-King und Das Kanonische Liederbuch der Chinesen, by V. von Strauss:\u2014Professor Legge has also printed an excellent book, entitled \"Confucianism and Taoism described and compared with Christianity.\"\u2014It may be added that Mr. Loseher has published a valuable map of the Province of Canton on a scale of unusual magnitude;\u2014that M. Bretschneider's work has been translated into French by M. de Plancy, under the title \"Recherches arch\u00e9ologiques et historiques sur Pekin et ses Environs;\"\u2014that M. Pfitzmaier has issued \"Darlegung der Chinesischen Aemter;\"\u2014and that, in the American Oriental Society's Journal, there is an account by Prof. S. Wells Williams of the \"Lieh-Kwoh-chi,\" a Chinese historical novel.\n\nAmong miscellaneous matters may be noted, that Sir Thomas Wade, one of the ablest existing Sinologues, is about to revise some of the works he has already published on Chinese: and that the Jesuit missionaries at Nanking have recently published the first two volumes of a series on Chinese language and literature\u2014the first dealing with the colloquial language, the second with the Thousand-Character Classic, etc.:\u2014a third volume is to deal with the Historical Classics: the translations, notes, etc., are in Latin by the editor, P\u00e8re Angelo Zottoli. The English Foreign Office has printed\na valuable Report by Mr. Baber of his journey from his post at Chungkin in Szechuen, to Tachienlu in the far West of China, the result of which shows that the frontier of Tibet extends far more to the East than had been hitherto supposed. A Chinese Professor has been appointed at Harvard University, U.S.\n\nIt may be added that the translation of European works into Chinese is now being systematically undertaken by the professors and pupils for the study of foreign languages in Peking. At the present time, many valuable English works, as Professor Fawcett's Political Economy, are in course of translation\u2014and the translation of works on Human Anatomy, Chemical and Mathematical Analysis, together with a course of Mathematical Exercises, are in progress. It would seem that the commencement of this movement is due to Shanghai, a department having for its object the translation and publication of books relating to the Arts and Sciences of the West, having been established there, in 1869, by the exertions of two leading Chinese gentlemen, Hs\u00fc and Hwa, who inaugurated their scheme by the careful study of the works of the early Jesuit fathers. These gentlemen were aided by an Imperial Edict, \"requiring search to be made for men of talent, and ingenuity, and versed in the sciences\"\u2014shortly after which, an office was opened at Nanking for the publication of useful books. Many valuable works by such scholars as Mr. Wylie and Dr. Edkins were given to the world\u2014till, at length, by the active support of the Viceroy, the Directors of the Arsenal were able to secure the services of Mr. Fryer, the able conductor of the North China Herald, and, subsequently, of Mr. Wylie and Dr. McGowan. A long list has been recently issued of all works so translated and printed between 1871 and 1879\u2014many of them comprising treatises on the Higher Mathematics. It may be added here, that when M. Thiers, four years since, presided over a Congress of Orientalists at Marseilles, he promised to give to the Library\nof that City, his copy of the great Chinese Cyclopaedia by the Emperor Kien Long. This valuable work was hidden during the siege of Paris; and having been fortunately preserved uninjured, is now to be disposed of according to M. Thiers' wishes.\n\nCatalogue of the Chinese Library of the Royal Asiatic Society.\u2014During the last year and a half, Mr. H. F. W. Holt, one of the Secretaries of this Society, has employed himself in the compilation of a Catalogue of the Library of this Society, the draft of which is now nearly ready. The Library is distributed into several different \"Cases,\" which, for convenience sake, have received distinct names, as \"The Staunton-Case,\" etc. In this \"Case,\" there are seven shelves containing one hundred and sixty-eight sets of books\u2014on light literature, biographies, mathematics, local chronicles, etc., in which latter class Chinese literature is especially rich; indeed, it may be safely said that there is scarcely a district or town in China which has not a separate chronicle of its own. Thus we have fourteen volumes in two cases devoted to an account of Woo-yuen, a district and town of the third class. Generally, the first volume has a map, with a series of plates denoting the most important places. The system under which this Catalogue has been compiled may be thus briefly described. Each \"Case\" will be a district. Each compartment of the case is numbered, each shelf lettered, while the books themselves bear consecutive numbers. Thus \"Staunton I. A1,\" indicates that the book is in the \"Staunton\" case, in the first compartment, and that it is the first work on that shelf. The title of each book is written in English letters as well as in Chinese characters, on the back, and the number it bears will enable any one in charge of the Library to replace the book, if taken out, correctly, whether he be acquainted with Chinese or not. But for some such arrangement, the library would soon fall\ninto inextricable confusion. In the fair copy of the Catalogue, the title of each work is written on a separate slip of paper, bearing the name of the case, compartment, shelf, number and subject of the book, together with its Chinese title, summary of contents, and date.\n\nA new and important feature has been introduced into this Catalogue\u2014the making it a combined one of other libraries besides that of this Society. As is well known, a Chinese work may, not unfrequently, consist of 300 or 400 volumes\u2014of which an individual library may possess only two or three dozen odd volumes. But by comparing the catalogues (few as they are) of existing Chinese libraries, it has been found that volumes missing in one, are, generally, to be met with in one or more of the others. Thus the Libraries of this Society, of the India Office, of the British Museum, and of University College, London, constantly contain fragments of a work, sufficient to make it complete, if only brought together. As, however, no such re-union is probable, the slips of the Chinese Catalogue of this Society have been carefully compared with the Catalogues of the Collections above mentioned, and with Mr. Wylie's invaluable \"Notes on Chinese Literature\"; and, wherever the same book is described or mentioned in any of these, a \"reference\" note on the slip indicates where it will be found. Thus \"B. M. Cat. p. 25\" shows where, in the British Museum, a given book may be seen.\n\nA proposition has been submitted by Mr. Holt to the Council of this Society, to form a comprehensive Catalogue of the principal Chinese Libraries scattered throughout Europe\u2014a commencement being made with that of the Vatican and of the College \"De Propaganda Fide,\" for which there were exceptional facilities. It was not possible, from want of funds, to carry out this project at once, but it is to be hoped that so important a scheme will not be permitted entirely to fall through.\nFor Japan we have in the Academy (Aug. 9) a letter from Dr. Edkins, giving an interesting account of the Japanese students now residing in Peking\u2014with a further notice of books sent by Dr. Kingsmill;\u2014and in Oct. 25, of the Geology and Geography of Japan.\u2014In the Journ. Asiatiqve for July, are notices of M. Hervey de St. Denys's \"Ma-touan-lin, Ethnographie des peuples Etrangers\";\u2014of M. Turretini's \"Atsume Gusa,\" and of the \"M\u00e9moires de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Etudes Japonaises.\"\u2014In the Trans. of the Germ. Orient. Soc. M. K. Himly describes \"Ein Japanische Schachspiel.\"\u2014In the Church Missionary Intelligencer Mr. T. G. Aston gives an account of the language spoken in the Loochoo Islands, and shows clearly that it is a dialect of Japanese, but without any literary culture.\n\nSeveral books in connexion with Japan are either just out or are promised shortly\u2014such as \"Unbeaten Tracks in Japan,\" by Miss Bird:\u2014\"The Classical Poetry of the Japanese,\" from a work entitled \"The Collection of Myriad Leaves,\" by Basil Hall Chamberlain, M.R.A.S.;\u2014and the Translation of the Book of Common Prayer into Japanese.\u2014General Legendre has published, at New York, under the name of \"Progressive Japan,\" a work written at Ko-ishii-kawa in Japan, the result of his researches among MS. authorities, not hitherto accessible. Among these the most important would seem to be Dai-Nippon-Kaibiya-ku-Yuras-iki, and the Sacred writings of the Japanese on the Shinto Faith. The volume contains an excellent map, and much useful statistical information. Mr. Pfoundes is preparing a work \"On the Folk-lore of Old Japan.\" Mr. Gilbert Attwood read a paper before the American Oriental Society on the \"Rei-gi-rui-ten\" or Court Etiquette of Japan, at their last meeting at New Haven. Prof. Rein, of Marburg, who was sent on a special mission to Japan, is about to publish the result of his researches. His first volume will contain, \"Natur und Volk des Mikado-reiches\"; the two following\nwill comprehend the Industry and Commerce of Japan respectively. W. Heine has published at Dresden, \"Japan, Beitr\u00e4ge zur Kenntniss des Landes und seiner bewohner in Wort und Bild.\" Mr. Satow, the Secretary to H.M. Legation in Japan, has received from the University of Marburg the degree of \"Doctor Philosophiae honoris caus\u00e6.\"\n\nCorea.\u2014The most important book of the year with reference to this distant land is the Rev. J. Ross's \"History of Corea Ancient and Modern, with Description of Manners and Customs, Language and Geography.\" Mr. Ross was for many years a Missionary in those parts, and is well known as a scholar from his \"Mandarin\" and \"Corean Primers,\" published successively in 1877 and 1878. Mr. Ernest Oppert has also published a book entitled \"A Forbidden Land\u2014Voyages to 'the' Corea\"\u2014as he calls what is more correctly termed \"Corea.\" M. F. Butzel has contributed to the Monats. f\u00fcr das Orient (Nov.) an article entitled, \"Korea, die Liuku Inseln, und die zwei Ost-Asiatische gross-m\u00e4chte.\" Mgr. Ridel, who has been for many years past engaged in Missionary work in Corea, is now in Japan, and about to publish a Corean-Latin Dictionary at Yokohama.\n\nSemitic Literature.\u2014Hebrew and Chaldee.\u2014There has apparently been no falling off in the extent of the researches made during the last year into the history, etc., of the Hebrew language, or in the number of books or essays which have been issued from the press. Many of the former are continuations of works noticed as in progress in the last Report of this Society. Thus, Rabbi R. N. Rabbinovicz has completed the tenth volume of his \"Varia lectiones,\" comprising \"Abodah Zarah\" and \"Shebuoth.\" To his reproduction of a few pages of the tract \"Pesahin\" of the Babylonian Talmud, from a MS. at Cambridge, Mr. Lowe,\nin a work entitled \"Fragments of Talmud Babli P'sachim of the Ninth or Tenth Century, in the University Library, Cambridge,\" has added a dissertation on the philology of the Talmud, as well as on passages relating to the New Testament.\n\nA third and fourth volume have appeared of Dr. Mo\u00efse Schwab's \"Talmud de Jerusalem\"\u2014containing the tracts, Troumoth, Maasseroth, Maasser, Sch\u00e9nil, Halla, Orla, and Biccurim; and Dr. Samuter has published \"Talmud Babylonicum, Tractat Baba Mezia,\" with a translation in German\u2014a work showing much critical knowledge and containing many valuable notes. Dr. Berliner has published, in the Mag. d. Wiss. d. Judenthums, an essay, entitled \"Beitr\u00e4ge zur hebr\u00e4ischen Grammatik in Talmud und Midrash.\" In this paper he endeavours to show that Talmudical schools had already cultivated Hebrew Grammar, in opposition to the received opinion that R. Saadyah Gaon (circa A.D. 930) was its real founder. Dr. J. Levy's \"Neuhebr\u00e4isches u. Chald\u00e4isches W\u00f6rterbuch \u00fcber d. Talmudim und Midraschim\u2014nebst beitr\u00e4gen von Prof. Fleischer,\" has reached the 11th part; some careful additions to this Dictionary having been made by Dr. Lattes in the Transactions of the Accademia di Torino. Dr. Kohut has published two fasciculi of the second volume of his \"Aruch Targum-Talmudico-Midrasch Verbale et reale Lexicon;\"\u2014and many other monographs on Talmudical literature have appeared, such as Dr. Levy's \"Essay on the Traces of Greek and Roman Antiquities in Talmudical Writings,\" read at the thirty-third German Philological Congress, in which he has given explanations of many of the Greek and Latin words occurring in the Talmud. Dr. Bloch, of Buda-Pest, has brought out the first part of a Hebrew work on the historical development of the ceremonial laws and institutions of the Talmud, which promises to be of value for the elucidation of passages in New Testament.\n\nDrs. S. Baer and H. L. Strack have jointly issued an\naccurate edition of Ben Asher's (Aaron ben Moses) Massoretical Treatise, entitled the Dikdooky Ha Teamim. In his preface, Dr. Strack gives an account of the work itself, and adds a great number of Massoretical notes from early authors who made use of Ben Asher's treatise. From these documents he fixes the date of this Massoret at A.D. 950. Dr. Baer's notes are of much importance for the text of the Bible.\n\nM. Leopold Niepoe has recently brought out an interesting contribution to Hebrew Bibliography, with the title of \"Les Manuscrits de Lyon, et M\u00e9moire sur l'un de ces MSS., le Pentateucho du vi* si\u00e8cle, accompagn\u00e9e de deux facsimiles par M. L\u00e9opold Delisle.\" A portion of this Pentateuch is now in the Library of Lord Ashburnham. It is a pity that they cannot be brought together. The fourth part of Dr. N. Br\u00fcll's Jahrb. f\u00fcr Judische Geschichte und Literatur contains, besides many interesting articles on Talmudical and Medieval Rabbinical Literature, two important Biblical contributions from Dr. Julius F\u00fcrst.\n\nThe discussion as to the original language and the object of the Book of Tobit has been recently revived by Dr. Gr\u00e4tz in his Monatschrift, in which he endeavours to show that the Sennacherib of the Jewish story represents the Emperor Hadrian, and Esarhaddon, Antoninus Pius. The three chief indications of the author's period (according to Dr. Gr\u00e4tz) are, the stress laid on beneficence, on marrying within the family, and, above all, in burying those who have been slain by the kings and whose interment had been expressly forbidden. The original language, Mr. Gr\u00e4tz thinks, was late Hebrew,\u2014the Chaldee text discovered in the Bodleian by Dr. Neubauer being an epitome of a translation. The country of the author must have been Jud\u00e6a; Egypt being excluded by the language, and Galilee by the topographical inaccuracies of the book.\n\nDr. Kohler, of Chicago, has maintained his well-deserved reputation by the publication in the Hebraica, a monthly supplement to the New York \"Jewish Messenger,\" of a very\ninteresting article headed \"Two Ancient Jewish Songs,\" in 2 Sam. i. 19-27, and Psalm viii. Dr. Kohler brings forward some plausible conjectures as to their author. Dr. Schwab has published in the last Fasciculus of the \"Actes de Philologie,\" a history of the vowel points in Hebrew, a useful compilation from previous articles and notes on the subject. Dr. A. S. Weissmann has printed in the Hebrew periodical Hab-boker Or\u2014published at Lembourg,\u2014and has since issued separately, an article \"On Cremation, Investigated from the Bible and the Talmud,\" his conclusion being that cremation was not uncommon among the Jews. M. Joseph Simon, of Nismes, has brought out a pamphlet entitled \"L'\u00c9ducation et l'Instruction des Enfants chez les anciens Juifs,\" in which he shows that the intellectual and moral state of the Jews in the last century is not only interesting for Jewish, but also for early Christian History. A similar essay has been recently issued in Germany by Dr. Marcus, entitled \"The Pedagogic of the Talmud;\"\u2014the \"Geschichte Israels,\" by J. Wellhausen, is a fitting supplement to this scholar's labours. A third edition of Delitsch's Commentary on Isaiah has been published at Leipzig, and the labour bestowed on it by its learned compiler fully justifies the expression on the title-page of \"durchaus \u00fcberarbeitet.\" Mr. Heilprin's \"Historical Poetry of the Ancient Hebrews, translated and critically examined,\" consists of the fragments of Hebrew poetry embedded in the Biblical narratives, and arranged according to the author's views of chronology.\n\nDr. R. Rulp's work, \"Zur lautlehre de Aramaisch-Talmudischen Dialekte,\" compares the phonetic changes the gutturals were liable to undergo in the dialects of the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmuds, respectively. His treatise will form a useful appendix to the lists of words showing the modification of the Aramaic dialects which are given by N\u00f6ldeke in his Mandaische Grammatik. Several other good contributions have been made towards the knowledge of Hebrew grammar.\nThus Dr. Stade has published the first part of his Hebrew Grammar, in which he professes to keep the mean between Ewald and Olshausen. The long-expected edition of the grammatical opuscula in Arabic, of Abou'l-Walid Merwan ibn Djan\u00e2h (the R. Y\u00f4n\u00e2h or R. Merinos of Jewish writers), has been published with a French translation, by Messrs. Joseph and Hartwig Derembourg, and a clear insight can now be obtained into the grammatical and lexicographical works of this celebrated grammarian of the twelfth century. The preface contains not only documents concerning Rabbi Y\u00f4n\u00e2h, but also unedited texts by Samuel the Prince on grammatical matters, as well as others relating to Samuel's biography and his disputes with Rabbi Jonah. In the same way Schedermann's Monograph on Capellus and the Buxtorfs is interesting for the history of Hebrew grammar in the sixteenth century.\n\nIn his review of this work in the Revue Critique, M. J. Derembourg has developed a new theory of the Hebrew vowel-points\u2014a subject on which M. Halevy has spoken at a meeting of the Acad. des Inscriptions, and nearly to the same effect. Prof. Chwolson has an essay on the quiescent letters he, waw, and yod, in the Transactions of the Oriental Congress of St. Petersburg, with many new facts or theories, and M. Vernes a very full review of Wellhausen's Geschichte Israels in the Revue Critique.\n\nOf other books\u2014many of them by writers already favourably known\u2014may be mentioned: M. Schwab, Des Points-voyelles dans les Langues Semitiques;\u2014Benzian, Bl\u00e4tter f\u00fcr neuere und \u00e4ltere Literatur der Judenthums, mit Literarisch Beilage von Dr. Steinschneider;\u2014Fessler, S., Mar Samuel, der bedeutendste Amora, Beitrag zur Kunde der Talmud;\u2014Friedlander, M. H., Geschichtsbilder aus der Zeit der Tannaiten und Amor\u00e4er, Beitrag zur Geschichte des Talmud;\u2014Gronemann, S., Die Jonathan'sche Pentateuch, \u00fcbersetzung in ihrem verh\u00e4ltnisse zur Halacha; Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der \u00e4lteste Schrift-exegese;\u2014together with the\nfollowing periodicals more or less specially devoted to Hebrew subjects and literature, viz.: The Jahr-bericht d. Rabb. Schule zu Buda-Pest;\u2014Jahrbucher f\u00fcr Judische Geschichte und Literatur;\u2014Dr. Rahmer's Judisch-Literatur Blatter;\u2014Jahrbericht des Jud. Theolog. Seminars zu Breslau;\u2014J\u00fcdischen Literatur;\u2014Frankel Monats-schrift f\u00fcr Geschichte und Wissenschaft der Judenthums, etc. In his Monatschrift, Dr. Graetz has published many articles concerning Jewish History in the time of the Second Temple, the substance of which will, no doubt, be incorporated in his next edition of his History of the Jews. It may be added, that Dr. Harkavy's Hammelitz has been suspended; and another periodical has been started at St. Petersburg, called Vyeztnik Ruszkikh Etreff, or Russian Jewish Messenger.\n\nThe important work of Dr. Schiller-Szinessy (of Christ's College, Cambridge) on Hebrew abbreviations, is advanced as far as the letter Pe, and will be of much service to Rabbinical scholars; the Chief Rabbi, Dr. Adler, has in preparation Critical Essays on the Targum of the Prophets; and S. I. Herschon, Selections from the Talmud and Midrasch, with an Introduction to the former.\u2014M. Adolph Schwartz is engaged on a critical edition of Discussions on the Pentateuch by Rabbi Ahai ben Gaon (8th century A.D.) from MSS. in the Bodleian, Vatican, and at Paris.\u2014M. Lansberger, of Darmstadt, is also preparing a critical edition of Berukhyah Nakdan's Mishlag Shualim\u2014Fox Fables (lived about A.D. 1280)\u2014to be in rhymed prose like the original Hebrew.\u2014Rabbi Isaac Hirsch Weirs, of Vienna, is at work on the Midrashic book called the Pesiktha Rabbathi, with a Commentary. The editor is well known as an able student and expositor of Talmudical literature.\u2014The second volume of Dr. Turpie's series of Oriental Manuals, entitled a Manual of the Chaldee Language, with a grammar of Biblical Chaldee, and of the Targums with a Chrestomathy and Vocabulary, will be very useful to English students of the Aramean dialects of the\nBible and the Targums, so far as the Grammar and Chrestomathy are concerned.\n\nDr. Berliner's Targum Onkelos is in the printer's hands. The first volume will contain the Targum itself, according to the edition of Sabrineta; the second, the Apparatus Criticus.\u2014The second Lieferung has been issued of A. Wuensche's Bibliotheca Rabbinica.\u2014The Rev. J. M. Rodwell has completed a literal translation of the Book of Job from the original Masoretic Text.\u2014Prof. Sch\u00fcrer, Monograph of the History of the Early Jewish Communities in Rome, as also Dr. Bergh's History of the Jews in Hungary, Dr. Giesse's History of the Jews in Westphalia, and Dr. Lowenstein's History of the Jews about Lake Constance and the surrounding country, are very interesting.\n\nM. Camille Arnaud's \"Essai sur le Condition des Juifs en Provence au Moyen Age\" contains many unedited documents from Archives.\u2014M. G. Saige has continued in the Biblioth\u00e8que de l'Ecole les Chartes, his valuable studies on the condition of the Jews at Thoulouse during the 14th century.\u2014The Rev. A. L\u00f6wy has read to the Biblical Archaeological Society two interesting papers,\u20141st, On the Samaritan Talmudical Writings, and the 2nd, On an Account given by a Samaritan in A.D. 1713, of the ancient copy of the Pentateuch preserved at Nabl\u00fbs.\n\nOf books to come, the following may be mentioned:\u2014\n\nDr. Horowitz is preparing a critical text from the old editions and MSS. of the Agadic book attributed to the Talmudical doctor, R. Eliezer, and known as the \"Pirkey di R. Eliezer\"\u2014Chapters by R. Eliezer. This work, the final composition of which is probably not earlier than the ninth century, contains, however, many agadahs of a much earlier date.\u2014Dr. A. Harkavy, of St. Petersburg, has published (Acad. Oct. 18) the \"Divan\" of Samuel the Prince (har-Nagid) discovered in the Firkovich collection of MSS. This Samuel was Minister of State to Halus, King of Grenada in\nA.D. 1027, and his poetical pieces are of value for the history of the Berber dynasty of the time, and of the Jews in Spain.\u2014A critical edition of the Massorah, prepared by Dr. Baer during many years from the MSS. and early editions, is shortly to appear at Wilna, on the margin of a new edition of the Rabbinical Bible, published by the Brothers Romm: this edition of the Massorah will not be a rival to the one on which Dr. Ginsburg has been so long engaged: rather the two editions will be complements, the one of the other. In the preparation of it, the extant commentaries by R. Hananel of Cairowan, R. Gerschon of Metz, and R. Meir of Gothenburg, will be made use of. Dr. Mandelstamm, the Russian translator of the Bible, is about to publish a Hebrew commentary he has recently completed.\n\nArabia.\u2014Many excellent papers and books have been published during the last year on matters appertaining to the Arabic language and literature, of which the following may be noted here:\u2014In the Journal of this Society, Vol. XII. Pt. 1, is a paper by Mr. J. W. Redhouse, \u201cOn the most comely names of God, or the Titles of Praise bestowed on God in the Koran,\u201d etc. In the recently-published first volume of the Transactions of the Oriental Congress at St. Petersburg in 1876, is a paper by M. de Goeje, Ueber die Geschichte der Abbasiden von Al-Iakubi, and by Prof. Mehren, Expos\u00e9 de la r\u00e9forme d\u2019Islamisme commenc\u00e9e au troisi\u00e8me si\u00e8cle de l\u2019H\u00e9gyre par Abou-l Hasan Ali-el-Ashari; and to the Transactions of the German Oriental Society, Dr. Goldziher has contributed an article entitled \u201cJugend und Straussen poesie in Kairo.\u201d In the Transactions of the Vienna Academy, Dr. A. H. M\u00fcller has published extracts from Hamdani\u2019s \u201cIkil,\u201d in connexion with the history of some parts of Yemen. In the Revue Critique, are excellent reviews, by C. E. R., of the Abb\u00e9 Barges\u2019s Recherches arch\u00e9ologiques sur les Colonies Ph\u00e9niciennes \u00e9tablies sur le littoral de la Celt-\nLigurie;\u2014by M. Clermont-Ganneau of the Comte de Baudissen's \u00c9tudes sur l'Histoire de la Religion Semitique, 2de cahier;\u2014and, in the Journal Asiatique, of M. Sauvaire's two papers on Arab Metrology published in the Journal of this Society;\u2014by E. P. Goergens, of Dieterici's Die Philosophie der Araber in xte Jahrhundert;\u2014by M. Gautier-Lucian, of Dr. E. P. Goergens' Arabische quellen-beitrage zur Geschichte der Kreuz-zugen. In the Athen\u00e6um is a review of Prof. N\u00f6ldeke's Geschichte der Perser und Araber, translated from the Chronicle of Tabari, a work of great importance for the Sassanian period;\u2014and, in the Academy, by S. L. Poole, of the several works of Prof. Dozy, M. Dugat, and Prof. Mehren, comprising a general notice of Muhammadan Theology;\u2014by M. C. J. Lyall of N\u00f6ldeke's above-mentioned work; and by Sir Frederic Goldsmid of Mr. Poole's new and greatly enlarged edition of the late Mr. Lane's Selections from the Koran.\u2014In the Calcutta Review, No. 138, Mr. Rehatschek has printed a portion of the Third Series of the Wilson Philological Lectures delivered in University Library, Bombay, January and February, 1879;\u2014M. Fleischer has printed Beitr\u00e4ge zur Arabisch Sprachkunder in the 6th Number of Extr. les Berichten d. Phil. Hist.;\u2014and Sir William Muir has issued a useful little book, entitled, \"Extracts from the Koran in the Original, with English Renderings,\" with the object of showing \"the beautiful and nervous diction of the Cor\u00e1n\" and of illustrating some \"of the better parts of Mussulman Theology.\"\n\nIt is satisfactory to know that the publication of Tabari is going on, if slowly, successfully, while we have to record the completion of other important works. Of these perhaps the most valuable is the translation into English by Prof. Sachau of Albiruni's Ath\u0101r\u016b-i-Bakya, under the title \"The Chronology of Ancient Nations,\" a title slightly misleading, as there is much more in this book than mere chronology.\u2014Prof. De Goeje has finished his three volumes of the \"Bibliotheca\nGeographica,\" and a 4th volume has been issued, with complete Indices to the three principal writers, Istakhri, Ibn Haukal, and Mokaddasi.\u2014Dr. Juynboll has brought out At-Tanbeh, Jus Shafiticum (anctore Abu-Ishak As-Shirazi)\u2014text only;\u2014and M. Seignet has published the \"Law-Book\" by Sidi Khalil, the code for Arabs belonging to the Malekitic rite\u2014with a French translation;\u2014Mr. Brock has given a revised edition of Zamachshari's Al-Mufassil\u2014and a new fasciculus (the 4th) has been brought out by Dr. Jahn of Ibn Jaish's commentary on it.\n\nProf. Dieterici has continued his work, in a second volume, on the Philosophy of the Arabs during the tenth century\u2014adding to his series the portion which relates to the microcosm, and publishing the Arabic text of a philosophical tale, entitled \"The Dispute between Man and Animal in the Presence of the King of the Genii,\" with a glossary;\u2014M. Guyard has completed a new translation of Abd-ur-Razzak's philosophical treatise under the title of \"Trait\u00e9 de la Pr\u00e9destination et Libre Arbitre;\"\u2014and M. Chauvin, a translation of Prof. Dozy's History of Islamism. Prof. Dozy has gone on with his Supplement au Dictionnaires Arabes, and has issued the fifth and sixth fasciculus. Dr. Hochheim has translated Alkarkhi's Arithmetical Treatise from a MS. in the Library at Gotha; and Dr. Fraenkel, Beitrage zur Erkl\u00e4rung der Mehrlautigen Bildungen in Arabischen. Among other publications, may be added, M. Clement Huart's \"La Poesie Religieuse des Nosaries\";\u2014the first volume of Amari's \"Biblioteca Arabico-sicula\u2014versione Italiana,\" a most valuable work;\u2014Prof. Wustenfeld's \"Synaxarium d. i. heiligen-calender der Coptischen Christen aus d. Arabisch \u00fcbersetzt;\" and \"Die Geographie und Verwaltung von \u00c6gypten nach dem Arabischen des Abu-l-'Abb\u00e1s Ahmed ben Abd-ben-Ali-el-Calapashandi;\"\u2014M. Clermont-Ganneau's \"L'imagerie Ph\u00e9nicienne et la Mythologie Iconologique chez les Grecs.\" M. Guyard has also published \"Trait\u00e9 du decreet et de\nl\u2019arr\u00eats\u2014diverses Textes Arabes publi\u00e9es pour la premi\u00e8re fois;\u201d\u2014and M. Uricoechea has translated into French the 4th ed. of C. P. Caspari\u2019s Grammar of Arabia, which formed the basis of the larger and more comprehensive work of Prof. W. Wright of Cambridge. M. Gasselin has published the first part of his Dictionnaire Fran\u00e7.-Arabe\u2014Arabe-vulgaire-Arabe-grammaticale. It is to be completed in 72 parts.\n\nAmong works in progress, or nearly ready, it may be mentioned that Dr. August M\u00fcller of Halle has completed his collation of the MSS. of Ibn Abi Ossey, containing biographies of philosophers and medi\u00e6val writers in Arabic, a work which is to be printed under the auspices of the Germ. Oriental Society;\u2014that Prof. Goergens, of Berne, and Prof. R\u00f6hrig have translated \u201cArabische Quellen, beitr\u00e4ge zur Geschichte des Kreuz-zuge,\u201d together with a life of Salah-ed-din; the chief author of the work being Abu-Sh\u00e2ma, who died A.D. 1267;\u2014that the Catalogue of Arabic MSS. in Paris, prepared by the late Baron McG. de Slane and M. Derembourg, is shortly to be printed;\u2014that Dr. Spitta, the Librarian of the Khedivial Library at Cairo, is printing a scientific grammar of Egyptian Arabic, a work likely to be of great value to philologists, as comparatively little is, as yet, in print on the special dialect of Egypt;\u2014and, that Prof. Amari is about to bring out a collection of Arabic Sepulchral Memorials (from Sicily), some of which have been already published in the Revista Sicula. The seventh volume of the late Mr. Lane\u2019s Arabic Dictionary is nearly ready.\n\nSyriac.\u2014But little seems to have been done in this department of Oriental research during the last year; but MM. K. G. Bruns, and E. Sachau have published jointly Syrisch-R\u00f6misches Rechts-buch aus dem 5te Jahr-hundert; the first volume of the Dean of Canterbury\u2019s (R. Payne Smith) Thesaurus Syriacus has been completed;\u2014J. Gildemeister has published \u201cActa S. Pelagiae Syri\u00e6\u201d;\u2014M. Nestle, Psal-\nterium Syriacum \u00e8 codice Ambrosiano;\u2014and a considerable portion of this valuable \"Codex\" itself has been photographed. J. Spanath has printed \"Bar Ebhraya, Gregorii Abulfarag in Evangelium Matthaei Scholia;\"\u2014M. Baethgen, three works, 1. Untersuchungen \u00fcber die Psalmen nach der Peschita. 2. Ein Melkitischer Hymnus an die Jungfrau Maria. 3. Sindban (or Sindbad), oder die sieben weissen meister (Syrisch und Deutsch); the last has been carefully reviewed by N\u00f6ldeke in the D. Morg. Ges. xxxiii. pt. 3. In the same work, too, M. Nestle gives a brief account of \"Gregorii Bar-Hebraei Carmina a P. Aug. Seebabi correcta,\" Rom. 1877. Prof. De Lagarde has made a valuable addition to the critical apparatus of the LXX. version, by printing the Paris portion of the Codex Sarravianus, the leaves of which, preserved at Leyden, were first printed by Tischendorf in 1870. The newly-printed portion forms part of M. Lagarde's \"Semitica.\" M. Lagarde has also reprinted an Arabic-Syriac vocabulary, first printed at Rome in 1636, the Kit\u00e2b-el-Targum\u00e2n of Eliy\u00e2 of Nisibis. The Syriac text of the Kalila wa Dimna, which Dr. Wright, of Cambridge, has prepared from the unique MS. at Dublin, is to be printed at the Clarendon Press. Though a translation from the Arabic, this text is of importance, not only for Syriac Lexicography, but also for the history of the translations into so many languages of this popular book. M. Zotenberg has printed extracts from \"La Chronique de Jean Ev\u00eaque de Nikiou,\" and proposes hereafter to issue in French the complete chronicle and the original text.\n\n\u00c6thiopic and Himyaritic.\u2014M. Pr\u00e6torius has completed his great work \"Die Amharische Sprache;\" and Professor Dillmann has published in Merx's \"Prophetie des Joel,\" the \u00c6thiopic text of the Prophet; he has, also, contributed to the Berlin Akad. d. Wissensch. a paper, \"Zur die Anfange der Axumitischen Reiches.\" In the Jewish \"Monatsschrift\"\nM. Metz has published a series of papers, entitled \"Ueber die zu meinem aufsatze zur geschichte der Falaschas, benutzten quellen;\"\u2014Colonel Prideaux has published his \"Himyaritic Kasidet\" from the Rich and Miln MSS. in the British Museum, and is preparing a complete edition of the poems of the Himyaritic King As'aa Tolba.\n\nAssyrian.\u2014The students of Cuneiform writings, etc., have not been less active this year than in former years, if, as is probably true, they have not been rewarded by such remarkable discoveries as might have been recorded in former Reports. Thus, in the Journal of this Society, we have to notice two papers, in both of which its President has held the labouring oar:\u20141. Notes on a newly-discovered Clay Cylinder of Cyrus the Great (Vol. XII. Pt. 1). 2. Notes on Captain Durand's Report upon the Islands of Bahrein (Vol. XII. Pt. 2).\u2014In the Journal Asiatique are several short papers bearing on Cuneiform subjects: such as M. Halevy's reply to some of M. Lenormant's remarks in his \"Etudes Accadiennes,\" (May\u2014June);\u2014M. Oppert's view of the meaning of the Assyrian word Zabat (ibid);\u2014a discussion between MM. Halevy and Guyard, as to the meaning of certain Assyrian words;\u2014a notice by M. Lenormant of M. Hommel's views \"Sur la legende Chald\u00e9enne du Soleil\" (July);\u2014M. Halevy's notes, \"On some Assyrian words\" (Aug. and Sept.):\u2014M. Oppert's paper, in which he states that the Sumerian or Accadian word Nitokhi (in Assyrian Tiloun) must be identified with the Island Oval-Samek\u2014or Bahrein\u2014where too, he thinks, must, also, be placed the legendary metropolis, Tyre, and the incunabula of Phoenician civilization\u2014a theory which M. Halevy denies (Oct. Nov. and Dec.);\u2014some further remarks by MM. Halevy and Guyard on certain Assyrian words (ibid);\u2014and M. Guyard, Notes de Lexicographie Assyrienne (ibid). In the Revue Critique are notices of M. Pogson's \"Inscription de Bavian\";\u2014and by M. Hommel,\n\"Sur deux Inscriptions d'Asurbanipal\" (Jan., 1880);\u2014and, a long and able review by M. Halevy of Prof. P. Haupt's \"Die Sumerischer Familien-gesatze\" (March, 1880). In Academie des Inscriptions is a paper by M. Henzev, \"Sur les terres cuits Babyloniens\" (Dec.);\u2014and one by M. Menant, objection to the view of the late G. Smith, that two figures on a cylinder described by him represented Adam and Eve (ibid).\n\nBefore the Biblical Archeological Society many papers of value have been read, as, for instance, an account by Mr. Rassam of his most recent excavations in Assyria (Nov.);\u2014a miscellaneous paper by M. Oppert, in which he stated his belief that the island called in Accadian Nitukhi must be the same as Tilun (the ancient Tylos, now Bahrein), and denied that the name Egibi was that of a firm of bankers, but rather a tribal title; with some additional notes to his chronology of Genesis (ibid.)\u2014by Mr. Boscawen, \"On the Monuments and Inscriptions on the rocks above the Nahr-el-Kelb near Beirut,\" (March, 1880);\u2014by G. Bertin, Notes on Assyrian Numerals (ibid.);\u2014and by Mr. Pinches, \"On a Cuneiform Tablet relating to the capture of Babylon by Cyrus, with a notice of the events that preceded it and led to it\" (ibid). Mr. Hyde Clarke also read \"Preliminary Notes on the Characters, Phonetics, and Language of the Accadians and Pre-Accadians,\" in which he suggested that the words and characters were not properly Akkadian, but derived from some language or languages of an earlier date, connected possibly with the epoch of the formation of syllabic characters, from which were derived the Cuneiform, Khita, Egyptian, Chinese, and American (April).\n\nIn the Athen\u00e6um, several papers and reviews have been published of great and general interest, such as Mr. Boscawen's account of Mr. Hormuzd Rassam's recent discoveries (July);\u2014the notice by Mr. Pinches on the gates of Balawat (ibid);\u2014a second paper by Mr. Boscawen, On the original\nname of Carchemish (Nov.)\u2014a letter from Sir Henry Rawlinson, On the capture of Ecbatana, with reference to a mutilated tablet, described by Mr. Pinches as one of Nabonidus, but on which he had, also, discovered a notice of the defeat of Astyages, King of Media, and of the capture of his capital, Ecbatana (Feb. 1880);\u2014and a letter from Mr. Boseawen, dated Aleppo, giving a very interesting account of the Chaldaean seals in the Collection of Signor S. Thomassini.\n\nIn the Academy we find a review by M. Lenormant of a paper by M. Haupt, entitled \"An Accadian Legend Text\" (Nov.)\u2014a letter from Prof. Sayce \"On the Pseudo-Smerdis\" (Dec.);\u2014a second letter by the same scholar, \"On the inferences to be drawn from the tablet of Cyrus\" (March, 1880); and a reply from M. Guyard to remarks in the Academy on the Babylonian word Imga (April). M. Lenormant has published in the Contemporary Review, for April, an interesting paper \"On the Genealogies between Adam to the Deluge,\" in which he suggests that antediluvian patriarchs may represent races and tribes, rather than ancient gods, the varying names given to them in the parallel lists of Sethites and Cainites being intended by the Hebrew writers to express the moral contrast existing between the two lines. M. Lenormant agrees with Dr. Goldziher in seeing the day and night in the original meaning of Adah and Zillah, the wives of Lamech.\n\nAmong the separate books or essays that have been printed during the past year, may be noted,\u2014M. Menant, Manuel de la langue Assyrienne, 1. Le Syllabaire; 2. La Grammaire; 3. Choix de Lectures, Paris, 1880;\u2014Do., Notice sur quelques Empreintes des Cylindres du dernier Empire de Chald\u00e9e, and Les Cylindres Orientaux du Cabinet Royal des M\u00e9dailles \u00e0 la Haye;\u2014M. Paul Haupt, Die Sumerischen Familien-gesetze in Keilschrift; ein Assyriologische Excursion;\u2014F. Lenormant, Lettres Assyriologiques, 2de S\u00e9rie, Etudes Accadiennes, Tome iii. 2de Livr.;\u2014H. Pogson,\nL'Inscription de Bavian, texte, traduction et commentaire philologique, I\u00e8re partie, No. 39 of the Biblioth\u00e8que de l'Ecole des Hautes \u00c9tudes;\u2014F. G. Pinches, Bronze Gates of Balawat;\u2014E. de Chossat, R\u00e9pertoire Assyrien (traduction et lecture), 4to., Lyon, 1879;\u2014J. Oppert, Le peuple et la langue des M\u00e9des;\u2014K. P. Patkanof, Sur l'exp\u00e9dition suppos\u00e9e de Taklat-palasar aux montagnes de l'Inde. Rev. Prof. Sayce is, we understand, thoroughly revising Mr. G. Smith's Chaldean Genesis, to which he will add much new matter.\u2014Mr. E. A. Budge, of Christ's Coll. Camb. has also published in the series known as \"Archaic Classics,\" \"Assyrian Texts, being extracts from the Annals of Shalmaneser II., Sennacherib, and Asur-Banipal, with Philological Notes.\" Inter alia, it may be stated that the collections in the British Museum have been enriched during the last year by a large number of inscribed tablets from Hillah, many of them of the highest importance: curiously enough, about 50 tablets have been detected as modern forgeries.\n\nUnder the head of Miscellaneous Semitic or Oriental may be noticed Mr. Popper's \"Der Ursprung des Monotheismus, eine historische Kritik des Hebraischen Altenthums,\" etc., in which his views as to the existence of Myths among the Hebrews go far beyond even those advanced by Dr. Goldziher:\u2014a work by Dr. Hommel, \"Die Namen der S\u00e4ugethiere bei den Sud-Semitischen V\u00f6lkern,\" a contribution of great importance, not only for Semitic comparative studies, but, also, for the history of the culture of the early people of this family\u2014the conclusion of the writer being, that the primitive home of the Semites was in the middle of the lower plain of Mesopotamia. Nor must we fail to notice, that Madame Mohl has reprinted the Annual Reports drawn up by the late M. Jules Mohl during the long period he was Secretary to the French Asiatic Society, under the title \"Vingt-sept Ans d'Histoire des \u00c9tudes Orientales, rapports faits \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique de\nParis, 1840\u20131867,\u201d the volumes being prefaced by a \u201cNotice sur Jules Mohl,\u201d from the pen of Prof. F. Max M\u00fcller.\u2014M. Schwab has, also, written a short treatise, entitled \u201cDes Point-voyelles dans les langues Semitiques.\u201d\u2014Before the American Philological Society held at Newport in July, Prof. C. H. Toy has read two papers \u201cOn Shemitic derived stems,\u201d and \u201cOn Expressions of Modal Ideas in Shemitic,\u201d respectively.\n\n**Egyptology.**\u2014This year, as on former occasions, we have to record the publication of a large number of essays, papers, reviews, and books on this subject. Thus in the *Atheneum* of March 13, is a brief but exhaustive account of the standing obelisk of Alexandria, by Dr. Birch. In the *Academy* (June 28) we have an interesting review by Miss Edwards of Brugsch Bey\u2019s \u201cHistory of Egypt under the Ptolemies,\u201d which was translated into English, two years ago, by the late H. D. Seymour and Mr. Philip Smith:\u2014in Sept. 6, a letter of much interest, from Mr. E. T. Rogers, entitled, \u201cMore Papyri from the Fayy\u00fbm,\u201d a discovery the more important that the large collection recently brought together by Brugsch Bey has been burnt while in the hands of the bookbinder. One of the new Papyri is as early as A.H. 158 (A.D. 775), and many of the letters still have attached to them their original seals.\u2014In Nov. 8, 1879, and Feb. 14, 1880, are two suggestive letters from Miss Edwards, on the best course to be taken for future excavations in Egypt, founded on a paper read before the Acad. des Inscr. in October last, by Mariette Bey (now Pasha);\u2014and, in Feb. 21, an important communication from Prof. Sayce, following up the views propounded by M. Mariette and Miss Edwards, in which, *inter alia*, he suggests the possibility, that the autograph of Herodotus himself may be one day found among the Greek graffiti, so abundant in Egypt.\u2014In April 10, is a further letter from Professor Sayce, in which he supports, from his own recent personal observation, the new views of\nBrugsch Bey, that the Exodus of the Israelites took place across the Sirbonian bog and not across any part of the Red Sea, as hitherto supposed.\u2014In April 24, is a letter from Miss Edwards accepting, generally, Brugsch's view, but questioning some geographical details advanced in the previous letter from Professor Sayce.\u2014In the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions is a letter from Mariette Bey, announcing his discovery of three st\u00e8les at Abydos (May 23): and a paper by M. Pierret entitled \"Essai sur la Mythologie Egyptienne\" (June 27).\n\nIn the Revue Critique are two reviews by M. Maspero\u2014the first of Brugsch Bey's \"Dictionnaire g\u00e9ographique de l'ancienne \u00c9gypte\" (Nov. 8); and the second, of three works by the same author\u2014which, practically, may be taken together to make one whole\u2014viz. his Geschichte \u00c4gyptens unter den Pharaonen; Verbesserungen etc., to the above; and the recent English translation (Feb. 9). The last review is important, indeed, is, in itself, a complete study. In the Journal Asiatique of Feb. March, April, 1880, is a paper by M. Maspero, entitled \"\u00c9tude de quelques peintures, etc., funerailles.\"\u2014Before the Society of Biblical Archaeology, papers have been read, by M. Revillout on \"Le Decret de Ptah Tolumen en faveur de Ramses II. et Ramses III.,\" being the translation of two st\u00e8les, one in the great Temple of Abu-Simbel, the other on one of the Pylons of the Temple built by Rameses III. at Medinet Abu:\u2014by Dr. Birch, \"On the monuments of the reign of Tirhaka:\"\u2014and by M. Paul Pierret, \"On the bronze Libation Vase of Osor-ur preserved in the Museum of the Louvre:\" its text has been already published by M. Pierret in the \"Recueil d. Inscr. du Louvre\" (Etud. Hierogl. No. 8). In a work recently commenced, and called the \"Revue de l'Histoire des Religions,\" are papers by MM. Barth and Maspero, \"On the Religion of Ancient Egypt:\" and Dr. Lauth has contributed to the \"Deutsche Revue,\" a paper entitled \"K\u00f6nigin-Nitocris-Rhodopis und Aschenbr\u00f6del's Ursprung.\" M. Lieblein has given in the Report of the Congress at St.\nPetersburg, vol. 2, an \"Etude sur les X\u00e8tas:\"\u2014Mr. R. S. Poole has published papers \"On Ancient Egypt\" in the Contemporary for Jan., Febr. and April\u2014and has written the article \"Egypt\" for the new edition of Encyclop. Britannica:\u2014Mr. Proctor, \"The Problem of the Great Pyramid\" in the Contemporary for Sept.: and Count V. Strauss and Torney, a paper, \"Zur Aegyptischen Chronologie\" in the Augsburg Allg. Zeitung, Heil. 212\u2013218. Of books or journals, one of the most important is the Revue Egyptologique, the first number of which was issued on January 1st, 1880, under the editorship of MM. Brugsch, Chabas, and Revillout. It is to be hoped that a publication, which has come out under such good auspices, may be well supported in the future.

Sprache has given various able articles by MM. Dumichen, Erman, Wiedemann, Revillout, Pierret, Pielh and others\u2014as have, also, the Recueil des Travaux relatifs \u00e0 la Philologie et l'Arch\u00e9ologie Egyptienne:\u2014The \"Revue Egyptologique\" has been already referred to.\n\nZend, Pahlavi, and Persian.\u2014The following reviews or papers may be referred to as bearing on this subject:\u2014In the Athen\u00e6um of July 12, is a good notice of the first of the three vols. in which Mr. Rieu, the Keeper of the Oriental MSS. at the British Museum, proposes to publish a complete catalogue of the Persian MSS. under his charge. The present one consists of 432 fol. pages, comprising history, biography, the Religion, Law and Philosophy of Islam, Christian, Parsi, and Hindu Theology, Travels, Geography, etc.;\u2014In August 2, is an interesting review of Sir Louis Pelly's \"Miracle Play of Hasan and Husein,\" which is now before the public in a far more complete form than has been previously the case. [The same work is reviewed by Sir F. Goldsmid in the Academy under date July 12];\u2014In the Academy, September 20, is a review by Sir F. Goldsmid of the fourth edition of Mr. Fitzgerald's Rub\u00e1iyat of Omar Khayy\u00e1m and the Sal\u00e1m\u00e1n and Abs\u00e1l of J\u00e2mi, rendered into English verse\u2014a sufficient proof, were, indeed, any needed, that the expression of Oriental thought can be made attractive to home readers;\u2014In the Trans. Germ. Orient. Soc. are papers by Prof Spiegel on \"Adar Gustasp\" (xxxiii. 3);\u2014by Prof. Eth\u00e9, N\u00e1sir Chusrau's R\u00e2san\u00e2inama oder buch der Erlauchtung;\u2014and by K.

Sauvaire contributes a paper, entitled, \u201cMat\u00e9riaux pour servir \u00e0 l\u2019Histoire de la Numismatique et de la M\u00e9trologie Musulmane,\u201d 1st part;\u2014and in the Trans. of the Germ. Orient. Soc. are papers of great value by Messrs. Stickel and Tiesenhausen, \u2018Die Weltbezeichnungen auf Muhammedanische Munze\u201d\u2014and by the late Dr. A. D. Mordtmann, \u201cDie Munzen d. Sassaniden\u201d (his fourth contribution on the same subject). Dr. G. Saleman also contributes a paper, \u201cUeber eine Pehlevisch-Arabische M\u00fcnze\u201d; and Dr. Fleischer gives a notice of a find of Sassanian coins at Oberlausitz, and suggests that they may have found their way thither by trade from Trebizond. To the Bengal Asiatic Journal Mr. C. J.\nRodgers contributes two papers, \"On the Coins of the Old Maharajas of Kashmir\" (with two plates), and \"On the Coins of the Old Sultans of Kashmir,\" respectively; and in the Proceedings of the same Society are papers by Rajendra Lala, \"On Pathan and Bengal Coins,\" and \"On Gold Coins sent to Calcutta by Mr. Rivett-Carnac\":\u2014by Dr. Hoernle, \"On the Gold Coins found by Mr. Simpson at Ain Posh,\" with a plate of the Ariano-Pali characters:\u2014by C.

Rivett-Carnac, \"On Coins of the Sunga or Mitra Dynasty of Ramnagar or Ahichhatra, the ancient capital of North Panchala or Rohilkund\":\u2014by General Cunningham, \"On the Gold Coins found by Mr. Simpson at Ain Posh\" (with three plates):\u2014and by Mr. Stulpnagel, \"On the Coins of Gheias-ed-din.\" To the Indian Antiquary, Mr. Hoernle contributes a paper, \"On the Monograms of the Baktro-Greek King Euthydemus,\" and Mr. Edward Thomas two papers, one, \"On some Bilingual Coins of Bokhara,\" and the other, \"On Andhra Coins.\" In Mr. Burgess's Archaeol. of W. India (Bombay Selections) Bhagvanlal Indraji has given an account of a collection of Coins from Kachh. In the Travaux de la Troisi\u00e8me Session du Congr\u00e8s d. Orientalistes \u00e0 St. Petersbourg, vol. 2, is a paper by the late Prof. Lerch, \"Sur les Monnaies des Boukh\u00e2r-Koudars ou Princes de Bokh\u00e2ra avant la Conqu\u00eate de Maverennahr par les Arabes\" [see Remarks by Mr. E. Thomas\u2014Report of 1879, p. evi]:\u2014and by M. Lagus, \"Numi Cufici, aliaque Orientis monumenta vetera in Finladia reperta.\" Among books may be noticed a remarkable series recently published in Spain (which, though not all of last year, it is convenient to group together) by Don F. Codera y Zaidin, the Professor of Arabic in Madrid, entitled, severally: Tratado di Numismatica Ar\u00e1bigo-\nEspa\u00f1ola;\u2014Cecas Ar\u00e1bigo-Espa\u00f1oles; \u2014 Errores de varios Numismaticos extranjeros al tratar de las Monedas Ar\u00e1bigo-Espa\u00f1oles \u00e9 impugnacion;\u2014Estudio historico-critico sobre las monedas de los Abbadies de Seville;\u2014Estudio hist\u00f3rico-critico sobre la historia y monedas de los Hammudies de M\u00e1laga y Algeciras;\u2014and Titulos y Nombres propios en los monedas Ar\u00e1bigo-Espa\u00f1oles. These works clearly show that M. Codera is at present the leading authority on Arabic-Spanish Coins.\n\nAn unique work has been recently completed in Japan called \u201cDai Nipon Kaneshi,\u201d or a History of the Coinage of Japan, from the time of the Emperor Jing\u014d Koga, A.D. 201\u2013269, to the eighth year of the Emperor Meichi (1876), by Yoshida\u2014it comprises no less than thirty-two 8vo. vols. Mr. Madden\u2019s History of the Jewish Coinage and of Money in the Old and New Testament (second enlarged edition)\u2014to form part vii. of the International Numismata Orientalia\u2014is in progress of publication. In the Zeitschrift des Deutschen Pal\u00e4stina Vereins is a brief but good paper, by Dr. Ed. Erman, called \u201cUebersicht der Munzgeschichte Pal\u00e4stinas\u201d (vol. ii. p. 1, 2), with a short note on the same by Mr. C. Schick; and a very interesting account by Dr. Erman of a discovery recently made at Jerusalem of an earthenware lamp in which were forty-one gold and 118 silver coins\u2014most of them of the fourth century of the Hejra, the latest being A.D. 936\u20137. They range over a wide extent of country from Taberiyah to Samarkand and Kirman. The earliest coins are the most common.\n\nEpigraphy.\u2014The study and the publication of inscriptions has progressed favourably during the last year. Thus in Mr. Burgess\u2019s last survey\u2014the report on the Province of Kachh\u2014are copies of inscriptions from that province in the Devanagari character with translations; and in various journals, Eastern or European, several interesting inscriptions have been published, to some of which attention will now be called. In\nthe Academy for Aug. 2, is an important review by Prof. F. Max M\u00fcller, of the second edition of Dr. Burnell's Elements of South Indian Palaeography, in which the Semitic origin of the Indian Alphabets is strongly enforced;\u2014in June 7, is a review by Mr. Rhys Davids of the 1st vol. of General Cunningham's Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum;\u2014and in Feb. 21, 1880, a review by Mr. Cheyne of M. Berger's L'Ange d'Astarte, \u00c9tude sur la seconde Inscription d'Oum-el-Awamid. [The same Inscription has also been discussed by M. Ganneau in Rev. Critique, Feb. 2.] In the Trans. German Oriental Society (xxiii. 3) Mr. J. H. Mordtmann has given a paper entitled, \"Die Himjarischen Inschriften in Tschinili Kioschkh\";\u2014and, in the Journal des Savants, for August, is an account of a Graeco-Egyptian Inscription in the Museum at Boulak. In the Journal of the Bengal Asiatic Society, No. 4, 1879, is a paper by Mr. V. A. Smith, \"On Chandel Antiquities\"; and in the Proceedings of the Society, Mr. Rajendralala notices a donation Inscription from Rajaurgarh;\u2014he also gives a note of the Inscription on a gate of the Krishna Dw\u0101raka Temple at G\u0101ya, and a translation of the Copper Plate Inscription procured by Major Holroyd from Nirmand in Kula.\n\nIn the Journal Asiatique (May and June, 1879) is an able review by M. Senart of General Cunningham's \"Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum\";\u2014and a paper by the same writer, the commencement of an Essay on the Inscriptions of Piyadasi (Asoka);\u2014a notice by M. Phil. Berger, Sur les caract\u00e8res Ph\u00e9niciens destin\u00e9s \u00e0 l'impression du Corpus Inscriptionum Semiticarum\u2014with copies of those used, respectively, by Bodoni, the Duc de Luynes, and M. de Sauley; and also of those adopted for the forthcoming work, the first fasciculus of which is expected daily. In the Revue Critique (Nov. 29) is, also, a review of General Cunningham's \"Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum,\" by M. Leon Feer;\u2014and in the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions, July 12, a Phoenician inscription from\nCarthage presented by M. Delattre is noticed with some good remarks on it by M. Renan. In the *Indian Antiquary* Mr. Fleet has continued his publication of Sanskrit and Old Canarese Inscriptions, Nos. LIV.-LXXIX., and, in the same useful publication are notices by Major J. W. Watson of two early Muhammadan Inscriptions in Saur\u0101shtra;\u2014and a report by Dr. E. M\u00fcller on the Inscriptions in the Hambantota District and on those of the North-Western Province of Ceylon: there are, also, two papers in it by the Rev. Thomas Foulkes, On a grant of the Pahlava King Nandi Varm\u0101;\u2014and a plate of a spurious early Chalukya Copper Plate Grant, now in the British Museum;\u2014Other papers are by Prof. Jacobi of M\u00fcnster on his identification of the name Pulas\u0101, in a K\u016b\u1e0da Inscription, with the modern Tuli;\u2014by K. T. Telang, on a new Sil\u0101ra Copper Plate Grant;\u2014by the Rev. Thomas Foulkes, on a grant of Vira-Chola;\u2014and by Dr. R. Hoernle, Note on a rock-cut Inscription from Riw\u0101. In the *Trans. Asiatic Society of Japan* are papers by the Rev. H. Stout, on Inscriptions of Shimabara and Amakusa;\u2014and by Mr. E. Satow, On the Transliteration of the Japanese Syllabaries.\u2014From the *Annales de l'Estreme Orient*, we learn that M. Marchand has sent the valuable Inscriptions he has collected in Cambodia to Prof. Kern, who has kindly undertaken to decipher them, and to send his account of them for publication in the \"Annales.\"\u2014In the *Calcutta Review* for July, is a good article on Monumental Inscriptions from all parts of the world.\n\nIn the *Ceylon Branch, Royal Asiatic Society*, 1880, is a paper by Dr. M\u00fcller (Government Archaeologist), On the text and translation of the Inscription of Mahindo III. (A.D. 997\u20131013), at Mahintale, with a glossary. [He is now engaged on a Corpus Inscript. Ceylonicarum.]\u2014The Hamathite Inscription has been recently set up in the British Museum. It has five lines of picture-writing, and, apparently, has formed part of a doorway. The Museum has also received several stone\nfragments from Djerabis, a slab with bas-reliefs, a draped man, and three lines of Palmyrene, from Palmyra. To the Museum, also, have been removed, and are now being attached to the walls of the chief staircase, the famous Amravati sculptures, formerly the chief glory of the India Museum. At the Society of Biblical Archaeology, a paper from Mr. St. Chad Boscawen has been read, giving an account of the inscriptions, etc., at the mouth of the Nahr-el-Kelb (Lyens) near Beirut. In the Athen\u00e6um of March 20 is a letter from Mr. W. R. Smith to Prof. Wright, of Cambridge, on some rude Inscriptions he copied near Taif; he thinks to be South Semitic, and one, in the following week from Professor Sayce, claiming for them an Egyptian origin; also, in that for April 20, a remarkable paper by M. Clermont Ganneau, giving an account of a Ph\u0153nician Inscription containing the name of Hiram King of the Sidonians. M. Carde\u00f1as has published Inscripciones Arabes de Granada;\u2014and M. Amador de los Rios, Inscripciones Arabes de Sevilla, and Inscripciones Arabes de Cordoba. The Paleographical Society has continued its useful labours. Thus, we have to record the publication of the 5th part of the Oriental series, under the careful editing of Prof. W. Wright, of Cambridge: this part contains selected leaves from Ashtasa-hasrika-praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 (Sanskrit) of the 13th century;\u2014\u0100ch\u0101r\u0101\u1e45ga (Sanskrit) of the same century;\u2014The Kor\u0101n (Arabic), 8th century;\u2014Diw\u0101nu-l-Adab (Arabic), 10th century?;\u2014The Kor\u0101n (Arabic), 13th century;\u2014The Epistles of St. Paul (Ethiopic), 14th century;\u2014St\u00e8le of Sakk\u0101ra (Egyptian Aramaic), 8th century;\u2014The St\u00e8le of Carpentras (Egyptian Aramaic), 4th or 3rd century B.C.;\u2014Inscription from Siah (Aramaic of the Hauran), late 1st century B.C.;\u2014The New Testament (Syriac), 8th century;\u2014Prayers, etc. (Mandaite), 16th century;\u2014Son\u0101k (Hebrew), the first year of 15th century.\u2014We feel sure that it will be a matter of general regret among scholars, that this admirable series, conducted by Prof. Wright, at the loss of much valuable time, should be\ncompelled to drop, from want of the support, which Oriental scholars might be reasonably expected to give to it.\n\nAfrica.\u2014Of new books on African languages we have the following:\u2014A grammar of the Ki-Niassa language by Mr. Alexander Riddel, of the Mission of the Free Church of Scotland at Livingstone on Lake Niassa; a work very well performed and opening out a new chapter in our linguistic knowledge. The language belongs to the great Bantu family. \u2014A grammar of the Mpongwe Language, to which a vocabulary is annexed by a late Missionary to the Gaboon on the West Coast, has been published at New York. This language is, also, a member of the Bantu family, and is, therefore, allied to the languages spoken on the eastern coast and in the south of the great continent, though totally distinct from the Negro languages spoken in its comparative vicinity. The Rev. F. W. Holbe has prepared an English-Herero Dictionary which will be published, if sufficient support be given to him. This language is spoken in Damara Land on the West Coast, North of the Colony of Cape Town. It belongs also to the Bantu family\u2014Mr. Palgrave, in the South African Folk-lore Journal, gives a long note explanatory of thirty-two Otyi-Herero words met with in the text of a paper given in the Journal by the late Rev. G. Viehe, with directions with reference to the Herero vowels, etc. A Zulu Dictionary and a second edition of a Zulu Grammar by the Rev. C. Roberts is, also, ready:\u2014The Rev. C. F. Schenker, the author of a Temna Grammar, published sixteen years ago, is now engaged on the compilation of a Dictionary of this language for the Church Missionary Society.\u2014Much has been done on the Eastern side of Africa, and, especially in Madagascar, where the Rev. G. Cousins and the Rev. James Sibree have pre-eminently distinguished themselves. Between them they have edited the Antananarivo and Madagascar Magazine\u2014and the latter has published a work entitled \"The Great African\nIsland\u2014chapters on Madagascar,\u201d which brings up to present date all that is really known about this remarkable island. It may not be generally known that a considerable literature has sprung up in connexion with this island, so that there are, at present, no less than seven Malagasy grammars and four dictionaries, in English or French, besides collections of Malagasy Folk-lore and Customs. A more complete Dictionary is in progress, as is, also, a revision of the Malagasy Bible.\u2014The Dictionary of the Swahili Language originally commenced by the well-known Missionaries Messrs. Krafft and Rebmann, has been thoroughly revised and largely added to. It is proposed to publish it by subscription.\n\nMr. Alexander Riddel has prepared a grammar and vocabulary of the Chinyanja language spoken at Lake Nyassa, perhaps the first attempt to reduce to writing any of the Kaffir tongues of Central Africa, except a sketch of the Mobba contained in the unpublished papers of Dr. Barth. To the veteran scholar, on all matters Egyptian\u2014indeed African, as well\u2014Dr. R. Lepsius, we owe the publication \u201cNubische Grammatik mit einer einleitung \u00fcber die v\u00f6lker und sprachen Africas.\u201d It is not too much to say that Professor Lepsius\u2019s publication is far away the most important thing that has, as yet, been published, on the thorny subject of the connexion or inter-dependence of the languages spoken in Africa; nor need we add, that he, of living scholars, is the fittest, from a half century\u2019s study, to do for Africa what Bria Hodgson and W. von Humboldt have done, for other branches of linguistic research. For Berber we have M. Basset \u201cl\u2019o\u00e8me de \u00c7abi,\u201d which has been printed, as has been already noticed, in the Journal Asiatique.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Report, Sir Henry Rawlinson (the President) said,\u2014\u201cLadies and Gentlemen, after the full report, which has been laid before you, of the progress of Oriental research during the past year, some portions of whic\nhave now been read to you, I feel relieved of saying more than a very few words. But I wish to draw your attention to the greatly improved condition of your Society\u2014as evidenced by the state of your finances, and by the high character and the increased number of the papers read at your meetings, and published, so far as we have had space, in our Journal.\n\nI see from the abstract of the Report that we have during the last year elected fifty new members, against a loss of nine, the advantage to the Society being, that we have now forty-one more members on our lists, than when I had the honour of addressing you at our last Anniversary; the gain to the Society, including the payments of Resident and Non-Resident Members, being certainly as much as \u00a385 per annum. It will be within the recollection of the Members of the Society that, not long ago, we were, like our friends, the Agriculturists and Merchants, suffering from what is called depression\u2014our subscriptions having gradually fallen off, with a Journal yearly diminishing both in bulk and value\u2014the natural inference being, that much less interest was taken in our proceedings than in our earlier days. Yet this depression was not due to any faults of our own; nor was it due to the exhaustion, or to the sensible reduction, of our field of legitimate operations. It was mainly the result of the drawing off of our best blood, our main supply of nutriment having been diverted into other channels, and distributed among many smaller Societies, more or less devoted to kindred subjects. Thanks, however, to our good constitution, and to the zeal with which we have been supported by the working officers of our Society, we seem to be now getting over this temporary difficulty\u2014this functional derangement\u2014as the doctors would call it. Our finances are sensibly improving, while literary contributions from Sanskritists, Sinologues, Assyriologists, Archaeologists and Oriental scholars of diverse classes, flow in to us from all directions; so that I do not hesitate to say that the current number of our Journal is quite equal to any of its predecessors, with\nregard to the extent, character, variety and quality of the papers to be found in it.\n\nAll, therefore, I will do now, is to invite the members present, and all whom they may be able to influence, to join us in a vigorous and sustained exertion for the future. Let all Oriental scholars\u2014each in his own special department\u2014exert themselves to the utmost, and we shall then maintain the Royal Asiatic Society in its pristine activity and reputation.\n\nFor myself I need say no more than this, that my tenure of office, as determined by my election in 1878, extends for one year more, and that, during this period, I shall do my best to further the interests of the Society, and with a thoroughly efficient and united Council, and the additional services of Mr. Robert N. Cust, as our Honorary Secretary, I have no doubt that we shall go on even more prosperously than before, not experiencing any slackness in the general sphere of our activity, or any hindrance to our career of usefulness.\n\nIt having been proposed by Sir Richard Temple, Bart., G.C.S.I., and seconded by Sir Arthur Phayre, K.C.B., that the Report be adopted, and this proposal having been duly submitted to the Meeting,\n\nThe President, Sir Henry Rawlinson, announced the following Members as the Council and Officers of the ensuing year:\n\nPresident and Director.\u2014Major-General Sir H.
