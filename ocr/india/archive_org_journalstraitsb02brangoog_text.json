But what we know on this subject amounts to very little and is little more than what travellers have said of most wild tribes. The muscular strength of the Mincopies is much greater than would be supposed from their short stature and rounded limbs. Like the Actae, they are remarkable for their extreme agility and the acuteness of their senses. Both\nparticulars gathered by a few travellers, which unfortunately come to very little.\n\nOf all the languages spoken by Negritos the most interesting to study would unquestionably be that of the Mineopies. Owing to the almost complete isolation in which these islanders have lived, especially in the Great Andaman group, (1) their dialects can only have been altered through natural evolution and independently of foreign influence. This language goes back certainly to remote antiquity and has probably preceded those now spoken in Malacca, Siam and in India itself. The study of it would consequently be of the greatest interest, as well from an ethnological as from a linguistical point of view.\n\nMr. E. H. Man seems to have understood it so. Before him, Symes, Colebrooke, R\u00f6pstorff, Tickel, &c., had confined themselves to gathering short vocabularies. (2) Brought into daily communication with the natives, in the course of his official duties, Mr. Man learned their languages. He translated in one of them the Lord's Prayer, which was published with a commentary\n\n(1) In my first \u00c9tude sur les Mineopies et la Race N\u00e9grito en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, I have mentioned the fact that signs of cross-breeding have been found in Little Andaman, south of the other islands. (Revue d'Anthropologie, Vol. I, p. 213.)\n\n(2) I have borrowed from these various writers some of the examples which seem most suited to show clearly the variety of Mineopic dialects, first pointed out by Mr. Francis Day. (\u00c9tude sur les Mineopies, p. 194.)\nand notes added by Lieutenant R. C. Temple. (1) Colonel Lane Fox, in two different papers, has given this translation, (2) and summed up, though rather too briefly, the general conclusions of the authors. (3) Thinking that it may be useful to readers engaged in the study of languages, I transcribe hereunder (4) the document which was the starting point of this investigation.\n\nThe study of the vocabularies to which I have just called attention had led Latham to admit of a certain connection between the Mincopie and Burmese languages. (5) M. Pruner-Bey has pointed out a few common traits in the Mincopie and New Caledonian dialects. (6) Hyde Clarke has fancied that he could discover in the Andamanese language affinities with those of several races of Asia, Africa and the two Americas. (7) Messrs. Man and Temple begin by stating that the nine tribes which figure on the map prepared by one of these authors, (8) have each a private language. \"A\n\n(1) The Lord's Prayer translated into Bajingjilda by E.

H. Man, Esq., Journal of the Anthropological Institute, Vol. VII, p. 105.) The Lord's Prayer was translated into the language spoken by the tribe inhabiting the southern island of Great Andaman, where Fort Blair, the English Settlement, is situated.\n\"native of North Andaman is as utterly unable to make himself understood by a native of South Andaman, as an English peasant would be by a Russian.\" It is not, therefore, a question of simple dialects, but in reality of distinct languages. Yet these languages have a common origin and structure; they are all agglutinative. Should they have any affinities with others, which Messrs. Man and Temple consider as doubtful, it might be with the languages of Australia or of the Dravidian and Scythian groups, which they resemble in a few peculiarities, such as the use of post-positions instead of prepositions; the use of two forms\u2014one inclusive, the other exclusive\u2014for the first person of the plural, and, in general, in the agglutinative structure of words. Reading over these few sentences one is naturally reminded of the connection already noted by philologists among others by our eminent colleague, Mr. Maury, as existing between the Dravidian and Australian languages. (1) To these Messrs. Man and Temple add a third philological group which has probably preceded the two others. Everything in fact tends more and more to prove that the Negrito race, of which the Mincopies are the purest representatives, is the fundamental negro element of all or very nearly all the Dravidian tribes and of those who, though not speaking a language classified under that name, resemble them in physical characteristics. (2) If this is really the case, are we not entitled to believe that the substratum of this linguistic family will be found in the Mincopic languages? At all events, it is an interesting problem to solve, and we heartily wish that Messrs. Man and Temple may pursue researches which have already led them to such curious results.\n\nThough scattered from the Andaman Islands to the Philippines, the Negrito tribes have retained, in a remarkable manner, all their exterior and osteological characteristics. It is otherwise with re-\n\n(1) La Terre et l'Homme, 3me \u00e9dition, p. 504. M. Maury is moreover inclined to connect these two groups of languages with the Medo-Scythian, which was probably spoken, he says, by the native tribes of Media and Sasanua.\n\n(2) I have dwelt on this question in a paper in the Revue d'Ethnographie, Vol. I.\ngard to language. This has in some instances, completely disappeared, through contact with superior populations, even where Negrito groups, numerically strong and enjoying a certain independence, have preserved a comparative purity of blood.\n\nThis fact had been observed in the Philippines, from the earliest period of the Spanish occupation. Even in the island named after them, these diminutive negroes spoke Bisaya, one of the local Malay dialects, (1) to which however they added a great number of foreign words. It seems to me probable that these latter were so many surviving witnesses of the primitive language.\n\nStill more must this have been the case in Luzon. The evidence given on this point by De la Fuente, (2) has lately been fully confirmed by the researches of Dr. Montano, who has kindly placed his unpublished notes at my disposal with a liberality for which I am happy to be able to thank him here. This traveller, who speaks Malay fluently and is acquainted with several of its dialects, was able to detect, in the Aeta language, not only grammatical forms, but even a vocabulary, almost exclusively Tagalog. One by one, he verified one hundred and four words collected by Mr. Meyer in the dialect of the Mariveles. He noted down those which seemed to be foreign to the Malay languages and could find but seventeen. He is still unable to speak decidedly about some of these. (3)\n\n(1) \"La lingua dell'Isola detta de' Negri e la Bissaya stessa col miscuglio di molte parole straniere.\" (L'Abbe Torres, quoted by Prichard, Researches into the Physical History of Mankind, Vol. V, p. 221.)\n\n(2) Prichard, loc. cit.\n\n(3) M. Montano found moreover in the same vocabulary, translated into the Negrito dialect of Zambales, thirteen words which are not Malay. He also obtained, not without some trouble, from an Aeta, the following verse of a song:\n\nMahalina uka imu\nI am going (oh my) friend\nmakpaha bath ha imu\nBe very prudent thou, friend\nTu ma papaki sayan uka imu\nAh! I am going very far my friend,\nluto ka man a bibing ianmo\nwhile you stop in dwelling yours.\nHoney hanan dalipatan mo.\nNever (your) village will be forgotten (by) me.\nM. Montano was unable to procure equally accurate information with regard to the language of the Mamanuas, or Negritos of Mindanao. But these people could make themselves understood by his guides who spoke to them a kind of corrupted or rather simplified Bisaya. (1) There also, no doubt, the primitive language has more or less died out.\n\nHas it been the same in the Malay Peninsula? M. Montano, does not think he can yet answer the question. He easily understood his Manhra (2) guide, when the latter spoke Malay to him; but he could catch but very few words when the same individual conversed with his wild countrymen. He is satisfied that the Mantras have a peculiar accent which may arise from various causes. Father Pouquet, who has lived for a long time in Malacca and visited all the inland tribes, told M. Montano that these wild people had no special language or dialect of their own, and that they spoke a mixture of corrupted Malay and Siamese. However, in his curious work on the Binas of Johore, (3) Logan regards it as certain that these people, though evidently more freely crossed with Malay blood than the Manthras, have had, in former times, a language of their own; and he brings forward numerous arguments in support of his opinion. (4) In the peculiar language, which they speak when searching for camphor trees (5) amid their forests, the same author has detected a certain number of words foreign to Malay. I have compared several of these with words in two\n\n---\n\nThe Negritos of the Albay province (South-east of Luzon) speak Bicol fluently. But they are crossed with Malays. The Bisaya Tagalog, Bicol, Pangango, etc., are but Malay dialects more or less considerably modified. (Montano.)\n\n(1) M. Montano says: \"a kind of Pidgin Bisaya.\"\n\n(2) The Manthras are half-breeds of the neighbourhood of Kesang, near Malacca, in the Malay Peninsula.\n\n(3) The most southerly region of the Malay Peninsula.\n\n(4) The Orang Bina of Johore. (Journal Indian Archipelago, I, p. 289.)\n\n(5) This language is called bauso-bapour (camphor language). Logan found it employed almost always the same by the tribes who search for camphor. These languages are peculiar, that it would be impossible to discover camphor trees if any other idiom but the bauso-bapour were spoken while search is being made for these trees. (Logan, loc. cit., p. 265.) M. Montano also mentions this language in his notes and spells it \"bauso-bapour.\"\nSiamese and Laosian vocabularies published by Latham (1) and could not trace any resemblance. Nor could I find any on comparing these again with M. de la Croix's vocabulary of the Perak Saka\u00eds. (2) M. de la Croix only finds twelve Malay words out of the ninety which he gives. The Russian traveller Miklucho-Maclay had previously gathered, among the wild tribes of Johore and further inland, one hundred and seventy words, (3) which several Malays, on being consulted, declared were perfectly unknown to them. Lastly Mr. de Castelnau had also arrived independently at analogous conclusions. (4) From this aggregate of facts, it seems to me to result that the original Negritos of the Malay Peninsula must have had a language of their own, which has been almost completely forgotten by a portion of their descendants and a little less so perhaps by others, because they are all more or less crossed with Malays, no doubt with Siamese also, and probably with other ethnological elements still undetermined. Was this language connected in any way with that of the Minopies? This is but an hypothesis, but the comparative proximity of the two races allows us at all events to put the question. Messrs. Man and Temple will perhaps one day tell us how much truth there may be in this conjecture. (5) They may also suc-\n\n---\n\n(1) Elements of Comparative Philology, p. 51.\n(2) Perak is situated about 2\u00b0 or 3\u00b0 North of Malacca towards the middle of the western coast of the Peninsula. We have no particulars as to the Negrito-Malay tribes which may exist further north.\n(3) Dictionary of the Malayan Peninsula (Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, No. 1, p. 38.) From Johore in the south of the Peninsula to Ligor in the south of Siam, the Russian traveller has ascertained the identity of language among tribes which are isolated and have no communication with each other. This result seems to have struck him with astonishment. There is, however, nothing in it which will not seem quite natural to any one who studies the history of Negritos taken as a whole.\n(4) Revue de Philologie, 1876. [I am indebted to M. Montano for this reference.]\n(5) It would, I think, be most interesting, with reference to this enquiry, to find out what language is spoken by the Negritos who have recently been discovered in the small archipelago of Tenasserim. Their comparative isolation might encourage a hope that their primitive language has been less altered than on the continent.\nceed in finding out whether there is anything solid in the singular affinities pointed to by Mr. Hyde Clarke, between the various Mincopie languages and certain African and American idioms. (1) Lastly it would be of some interest to investigate whether the language of the Puttouas of the Amarkantak mountains, which is perfectly different from any Dravidian dialect of the neighbourhood, (2) would seem to be at all connected with those spoken in the Andaman Islands or Malay Peninsula.\n\nSocial State.\u2014The Mincopies depend exclusively for their existence on hunting and fishing and have no permanent homes. Living on the shores of a sea in which fish is remarkably abundant, within immediate reach of dense forests where pigs are very numerous, and honey and fruits plentiful, they have not felt the want of claiming from the soil a supplement of food, and this very state of comfort has, in itself, kept them down on the lowest rung of the social ladder. (3)\n\nMost travellers, who have visited the Philippine Islands, have spoken of the Aetas as having never got past this step, though placed in much less favourable conditions. La Gironnere, (4) and Meyer are very positive on this point, (5) and M. Giglioli has unreservedly accepted what they say on the subject. (6) Rienzi himself, to whom we are indebted for information as to the more happy past of these people, represents them as living nowadays exclusively on wild fruits and the proceeds of fishing and hunting.

No doubt also, the interestedly false statements made to travellers by the petty chiefs of Tagal villages, (*) have led to the admission, as general, of a state of things which is, perhaps, more or less exceptional. In reply to these exaggerations, I cannot do better than copy almost verbally M. Montano's own words:\u2014\n\n\"The Negritos of the Bataan province seemed to value fully the security afforded to them by the just and enlightened administration of the Governor, Don Estanislao Chaves. I have visited them in their own mountains.....The house of the chief, very clean indeed, was situated on an eminence surrounded by other small hills. Several huts had been erected, every one of them in the centre of a clearing of a few acres planted with banana-trees, rice, sugar-cane and, above all, sweet potatoes........\n\n\"The chief shouted, and immediately the shouts were repeated near and far. Before long the whole tribe had gathered round me......In the province of Albay, where the conditions of life must be similar to those which exist in Bataan, I have seen a considerable quantity of cacao that had been gathered by the Negritos inhabiting the islands of the bay.\"\n\nEven among the Mamanousas (*) of Mindanao, of whom the last survivors are constantly being hunted down by the ferocious Manobros, the French traveller saw on the eastern shore of Lake Mainit, \"a timid tribe, very distrustful, who had nevertheless cleared a space in the jungle, erected huts, and planted banana-trees and sweet potatoes.\"\n\nThus, all that has been said about the indomitable roving instincts of Aetas is thoroughly inaccurate. If, in certain parts of the Archipelago, these diminutive negroes lead a wandering life, if they do not build huts or till the soil, the fault lies with those who persecute and victimize them. The method of cultivation just\n\n(*) M.S. note of M. Montano.\n(*) Name given to Negritos in Mindanao. (Montano).\nmentioned, very primitive by the way, is to be seen among the half-breed Negritos of India and the Malay Peninsula. All of them seem to proceed in the same way. The Gond, like the Manthra, begins by felling the trees which he burns when half dried up. In the entanglement of trunks and branches, he then sows or plants rice, potatoes, &c. When the jungle shoots up again, he abandons his frail and leaf-covered hut and proceeds elsewhere to begin over again. A dog, a few fowls and pigs live as best they can in these primitive clearings. What they can get by fishing and hunting, together with edible roots and jungle fruits, seem to form the principal resources of these people.\n\nSuch is the present state of things. But have not these tribes, now half-nomad and scattered, known better days and enjoyed a more perfect social organization? It is not easy to give a general answer to this question.\n\nAs far as regards the Mincopies, nothing indicates that they ever rose above what we know them to be now-a-days. Having, so to speak, under their hand, all that can satisfy the simple wants of a wild man, and without intercourse with foreigners, they have received nothing that could awaken new aspirations in them, and their intellectual activity has been applied solely to multiplying or improving the implements required by their mode of life. We shall see further on that they have, in that line, evinced real initiative power.\n\nIt is more than probable that in the Philippines, the Aetas were once in a more advanced stage. Rienzi, whose summary of the traditions of these people is unfortunately rather confused, represents them as having in by-gone days occupied the whole of Luzon and having for a long while resisted the Tagal invasions. They had, in those times, a form of government. An assembly of chiefs and elders superintended the execution of the laws. It is difficult to admit that, at that period, cultivation of the soil was not\n\n---\n\n(1) Notes (unpublished) of M. Montano; Rousselet, loc. cit. p. 276; Logan, loc. cit. p. 255; etc.\n(2) Oceania, Vol. I, p. 301.\n(3) This is precisely what is still the custom among the Bhils, half-bred Negritos. (Rousselet, loc. cit. p. 61).\npractised at least in the same degree as that described by M. Montano.\n\nWith still more reason must it have been the same with the more or less mixed tribes of Malacca. M. Montano informs us that the Manthras have still preserved a recollection of the days when their ancestors ruled over the whole country. At that time, they say, they had numerous records written on leaves. This fact implies in itself a social state of which M. Montano seems to have found traces in the very name of his guide. He was called, as his father, grandfather, and, no doubt, his ancestors had been, Panglima dalam, which the traveller translates as \"the lord who administers the Sultan's palace.\" (1) This descendant of some great dignitary is now but a simple coolie in a Chinese plantation. In the Malay Peninsula, as in India, conquest has destroyed States that were considerable and flourishing once upon a time, but of which even recollection has been lost, driving back to the jungles and mountains the races, more or less Negroid, which had founded them. There the race, like many other Dravidian (2) groups, has returned to a wild life. It has been broken up and divided into tribes and small communities, (3) and the hierarchy of chiefs, recorded by Logan as existing among the Berman populations, is probably all that is left of its former social state. (4)\n\n(1) Montano. Quelques jours chez les indig\u00e8nes de la province de Malacca. (Revue d'Ethnographie, Vol. I, p. 48).\n(2) The Bhils among others; however, they still have permanent homes, well built houses grouped in villages. What may be considered as a supposition with regard to some of the Berman tribes would seem to be well ascertained with respect to their brethren the Binnas. Logan informs us that the latter were in former times governed by kings, the origin of whom was supposed to be supernatural and whose descendants are still to be found. (Logan, loc. cit., p. 279).\n(3) Montano, loc. cit., p. 46.\n(4) In his Memoir on the Binnas of Johore, Logan gives particulars concerning five tribes to which all that I say here specially applies; they are the Udaus or Orang Tagos, the Jakunus, the Sakais, the Mintras or Manthras and the Besiasis. These tribes inhabit the mountainous region of Gunung Berman, one of the highest ranges in the Malay Peninsula. Amongst the Manthras there exist head-men (Batin) whose jurisdiction extends over well defined districts. Each Batin has under him a Jiwang, a Jukra or Jorokra, and an indefinite number of Panglimas and Ulubatangs. On the death of a\nAmong Negritos, everywhere the family seems to have survived the general decline of the race. A Sepoy deserter whose assertions have been too easily accepted by some writers, represented it as rather loosely constituted in the Andaman islands. Information gathered by Lieutenant St. John (1) and particularly by Mr. Dav, (2) has corrected what was erroneous in these early reports. The Minopies are monogamous. Marriage only takes place with the consent of the guardian of the maidens, who sanctions the union of the pair by joining their hands together. The duties of man and wife are reciprocal, and the parents evince the most tender affection for their offspring. (3) In the Philippine Islands, La Gironni\u00e8re ascertained analogous facts, even among the wretched and savage tribe which he visited. \"The Aetas,\" says he, \"are faithful in wedlock and have but one wife.\" When a young man has made his choice, he applies to the parents, who never refuse their consent, but send the girl into the forest where she hides herself before daybreak. The young man has to find her, and, if he does not succeed, has to relinquish all claim. (4) It is evident that the decision really depends on the young girl.\n\nM. Montano's notes confirm and complete the information given by La Gironni\u00e8re. He moreover acquaints us with the curious ceremony which ratifies wedlock among the Aetas of Luzon. The young couple climb up two flexible trees which an old man bends down towards each other. When the head of the bridegroom touches that of the young woman the marriage is pronounced legal and is followed by a big feast and war dances.\n\nI also borrow from the same traveller the following interesting particulars relating to the Negritos of Mindanao.\n\n\"Among the miserable Mamanuas, those ancient owners of the\n\nBatin, his successor is chosen from among the sons of one of his sisters. (The Binna of Johore. Journal of the Indian Archipelago, Vol. I, p. 275).\n\n(1) Loc. cit. p. 245.\n(2) Loc. cit. p. 160.\n(3) Mouat, Adventures and Researches among the Andaman Islanders, p. 295.\n(4) Loc. cit. p. 302.\nland, (1) who are described as so degraded, I have found the same habits as among the Negritos of Mariveles; I have witnessed the same veneration for old men, the same love for children, the same respect for the dead. Among this tribe, which is fast dying out, the old customs have preserved an unabated influence. These customs are simple indeed, and the procedure elementary, but they do exist. It must not be supposed that a Mamanua can act as he likes in his own hut without having an account to give to anyone.\n\nAn unfaithful wife may be killed by her husband, but not unless the adultery be proved, in which case the relations of the guilty woman assent to her death. Otherwise he would be considered as a common murderer and liable to be condemned to death by the chief of the tribe, on the complaint of the relations of the victim.\n\nAdultery, however, like other offences or crimes, is exceedingly rare among the Negritos of these regions. The young girls are very modest in their demeanour. The slightest suspicion on that score would be an obstacle to their finding a husband.\n\nA Negrito does not buy his wife, he simply makes a small present to his future father-in-law, who generally gives his daughter a dowry equivalent to what he has thus received.\n\nPrivate property is well recognised and can be transmitted by sale or inheritance. Every field is the incontestable property of the one who has cleared it, or his heirs. At the death of the father, should the mother still be alive, the estate is divided in two, one-half going to the latter, the other half to the children, between whom it is divided in equal shares.\n\nIf the children are grown up, the widow continues to live in the hut of her late husband, but should she be very young, she removes with them to the abode of her parents.\n\nAll disputes are settled by the chief of the tribe and his decisions are always scrupulously obeyed. He has, however, but seldom to interfere.\n\n(1) Banna \"land\"; ka possessive prefix. (Montano.)\nWe must acknowledge that there is a great discrepancy between this state of things, as described by M. Montano, and the information given by his predecessors. This is one more instance, to be added to many others, of the imprudence of limiting oneself to superficial observation when it is a question of forming an opinion of these backward and wild populations.\n\nIn spite of their intermixture with alien races, the Negritos of Malacca would, no doubt, if better known, exhibit similar social characteristics. M. Montano tells us that they never go to war, (1) that parents attend most tenderly on their offspring, and, if necessary, will, for their sake, deprive themselves of food. Logan informs us that, among the Manthras, adultery is punished with death, but not unless, as among the Mamanuas, the crime be proved by witnesses. The sentence is passed by the head chief (Batin) and carried out by the Panglima. The two culprits are laid down in the nearest stream and their heads are kept under water by the means of a fork. A man who is convinced of his wife's misconduct, but who has no actual proof of it, can leave her on condition of giving up to her his house and fields, a certain amount of cotton stuff, a few rings, and a small sum of money. The children remain with their mother, but she cannot re-marry until her divorced husband has taken to himself another wife.

(The Binua of Johore, p 273.)\n\n(2) Luc. cit., p. 26.\n\n(3) I must remark here that this paper is exclusively devoted to the study of the Negritos proper. As for the Papuan-Negritos, mixed with the Papuans of New-Guinea and the adjacent island-groups, it is very possible that they may have let themselves be carried away by example and may have addicted themselves to man-eating; but it is impossible, for want of accurate information, to give an opinion on the subject. The confusion which has too long existed concerning these two races and which is still more or less kept up by some of the most recent travellers, makes it very difficult to study them independently of each other. The examination of skulls permits of our distinguishing the two races, but throws no light on the various characteristics which divide them in other respects.\nbrought against several of these tribes, particularly against the Mincopies. Now, far from having any liking for human flesh, the Andamanese look upon it as a deadly poison. (1)\n\nAll Negritos cook meat by boiling or roasting; all consequently are able to procure fire and no doubt use the same process, the friction of two pieces of wood. This is an uncertain and laborious task, even for savages, and therefore when the first spark is procured, they devise means to preserve it. The Mincopies have invented a peculiar method of their own: \"The large trees are charred in the interior: a great hollow is formed in the centre in which they allow about three feet of ashes to accumulate, under which fire is always found\u2014over the fire of these strange ovens the Min- copie can grill his little pig, fry his fish and prepare his turtle soup.\" (*) Among the Manthras the charred tree is replaced by a heap of clay enclosed in a wooden frame in which fire is carefully kept up. (*) In cold or temperate climates the most urgent wants, after food, are shelter and clothing. In tropical countries, on the contrary, clothes are a matter of luxury and are often more inconvenient than useful. It is almost the same with regard to dwellings. A simple cover, affording shade during the day, shelter from the moon's rays at night, and protection from rain, answers all the most important purposes. Travellers are but too often unmindful of these circumstances, and many writers look upon this extreme simplicity of dress or houses, as a sign of intellectual inferiority and want of industry. The Mincopies have been reproached with wearing no clothes. It is a fact; with the exception of a girdle to which I shall refer further on, their dress is limited to uncouth tattooing or painting such as we see in Mr. Dobson's phototypes. (*) Still, in order to protect themselves against mosquitos or other insects, they are in the habit, when night comes on, of smearing the body with a thick coating of\n\n(1) Day, loc. cit. p. 165.\n(2) Macuat, Adventures, p. 308.\n(3) Montano, loc. cit. p. 46.\n(*) On the Andamans and Andamanese.

They can thus sleep in peace; but it is obvious that this night-dress goes a long way towards developing the rheumatic and abdominal diseases to which they are particularly subject.\n\nPerpetually wandering as they do, along their shores, the Andamanese are not given to erecting permanent dwellings. Four poles secured together at the upper ends and covered with broad leaves give them a perfect hut, which is quickly erected and affords capital shelter against rain\u2014the only thing they seem to dread. Such a hut is in reality a kind of impervious tent, the materials of which are entirely supplied by the neighbouring jungle, and which need not be transported from place to place. They could not possibly have contrived anything better, and our own African soldiers would deem themselves lucky, could they but do the same.\n\nThe Aetas are scarcely better clad than their Andamanese brethren. (1) Further, such of their tribes as are subject to the continual attacks of formidable enemies do not even erect temporary sheds, but sleep in trees, or, as a protection against cold, roll themselves up in the hot ashes of a large fire kindled for the purpose. But we have seen already that, when placed in normal conditions of life, they know how to erect permanent houses and settle down.\n\nThe photographs of M. de Saint Pol-Lias represent the Saka\u00efs as wearing a simple waist cloth tied round the waist with the ends hanging down on the thighs. M. Montano has described the bamboo hut of a Manhra family whom he met living by themselves in the midst of the forest. (2) Though anything but luxurious, this dwelling exhibited the peculiarity of having a floor raised two feet off the ground. In almost all of the houses of our own peasants the bare earth is the substitute for plank floors and in this respect at all events the Malay savage understands hygienic conditions better than the European.\n\n(1) A portrait of an Aeta chief, engraved after a photograph by M. Montano has been given by me in a memoir called\u2014Nouvelles \u00c9tudes sur la distribution g\u00e9ographique des N\u00e9gritos et sur leur identification avec les Pygm\u00e9es asiatiques du C\u00e9lebes et de Pline. (Revue d'Ethnographie, Vol. I, p. 183).\n(2) Loc. cit p. 46.\nThe Minopies live exclusively on hunting and fishing, but owing to their isolation and also to the fables that have been spread concerning some of their habits, (1) they have been free to develop quietly the various industries suited to their mode of life. The results attained by these islanders had already forcibly struck the learned observers who were the first in our time to study the Andamans and their inhabitants. Notwithstanding their contempt for these \"savage negros,\" Colebrooke, Symes, and especially Mouat have in many instances done justice to their merits in this respect. (2) Thanks to Mr. Man, we are now better acquainted with them. He got together and sent to London a valuable collection illustrating most of the native industries, and of this Major-General Lane-Fox (3) has given an account as interesting as it is instructive. I can only very briefly sum up these various documents.\n\nLet us notice first of all that the Andaman Islands, where iron seems to have been introduced by the Chinese and Nicobarese, have had their stone age, the remains of which are still to be found in kiekkenmaddings, entirely similar to those of Denmark. These heaps of \"kitchen refuse\" were discovered by M. de Roepstorff (4) and more closely examined by Dr. Stoliczka. (5) Hammers and knives were found in them together with rude hatchets undoubtedly corresponding with the chipped implements of our stone age. Close to these were discovered a polished axe which Stoliczka declares to be identical with the \"celts\" of the neolithic period, and also a real chisel, three inches long, with a sharp edge at one\n\n(1) In a paper specially devoted to the Minopies, I have recorded some of the fables borrowed from Marco-Polo and Arab writers\u2014Revue d'Anthropologie, Vol. I, p. 403.\n(2) I must here refer the reader to my first paper, already quoted.\n(3) Observations on Mr. Man's Collection of Andamanese and Nicobarese Objects, by Major-General Lane-Fox, p. ii., with four plates. (The Journal of the Anthropological Institute, Vol. VII, p. 434).\n(4) A Short List of Andamanese Text Words. (Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, 1870, p. 178). The Kiekkenmadding discovered near Hope Town was about 60 feet in circumference and 12 feet high. Several of such and even larger heaps are to be found in various parts of Chatham Island.\n(5) Note on the Kiekkenmaddings of the Andaman Islands. (Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, 1870, p. 18).\nNumerous fragments of sun-baked pottery, decorated with incisions of irregular designs, (1) were found in the same place. The Minopies still manufacture pots of the same kind, and if they have not yet attained the art of baking pottery in a kiln, this is due, no doubt, to the facility with which they can replace water vessels by a length of bamboo, and cooking utensils by the large shells of the Tridacna and Turbo.\n\nWith the exception of harpoons exclusively used for fishing, the bow is, according to the latest travellers, the only weapon employed in hunting or warfare. (2) The bow used in Little Andaman is very similar to most others, being straight and symmetrically tapered from the middle to the ends. (3) In the Great Andaman, on the contrary, it assumes a peculiar shape. In the middle there is a kind of cylindrical handle of a comparatively small diameter; the two sides, rather wide at first, are flat inside with a convex back; they get thinner towards the extremities and are curved in opposite way so that the whole reminds one of an elongated \u00a7. This bow is from 1=75 to 2m in length. (4) It is very hard to bend, and the strongest English sailors were unable to string it. (5) In spite of their small stature and rounded limbs, the Minopies used it so skillfully and with such power that, at 40 or 50 metres, the arrows penetrated right through the clothes of Europeans and deep into the flesh. Several varieties of arrows are used, among which there is one which might be styled a hunting harpoon. The head of it, to which the point is attached, is very small, whilst the shaft is 1m long. The two parts are brought together by means of a strong cord twisted round so as to keep the two independent portions together. When a pig is struck and tries to escape headlong through the jungle, the cord unrolls itself, the barbed point of the\n\n(1) Plate XVI of General Lane-Fox's Note represents several of these designs.\n(2) Symes alone has mentioned long spears and shields made of bark.\n(3) Lane-Fox, Pl. XIV, fig. 3.\n(4) Mouat, Loc. cit., p. 321.\n(5) General Lane-Fox observes that the same shaped bow is to be found at Mallicolo. It also resembles the Japanese bow in so far as the ends are not symmetrical. (Loc. cit., p. 440).\narrow remains in the flesh, but the shaft which is dragged after him, keeps on checking the course of the animal which is soon captured.\n\nThe Mincopie canoe has deservedly attracted the attention of the English. It is cut out of the trunk of a tree: outside, it is highly finished; the sides are very thin, and the bottom very thick. Being thus naturally ballasted, it cannot capsize and even when riddled with bullets it does not sink.\n\nThey are propelled by paddles, with marvellous speed. The gig and cutter of the Pluto, manned by picked crews, had a trial with a Mincopie canoe, and were completely beaten; the victory of the savages was owing to the superiority of their workmanship. (1)\n\nIt is useless my dwelling any longer on the various manufactures of these islanders and mentioning their harpoons, nets, &c., Here, again, they prove themselves to be equal, and at times much superior to other races placed in the same conditions of life. The collection made by Mr. Man and the plates which accompany the paper of General Lane-Fox are sufficient to refute all that has been said concerning the intellectual degradation of the Mincopies.\n\nIt is otherwise with regard to the Actas, whom persecution keeps in a continual wandering state, and there is nothing surprising in the fact. The only weapons they use in war or hunting expeditions are a short spear, a bow, and one single kind of arrow. But these latter are poisoned, and the slightest wound, if not deadly, causes, at least, long and acute suffering, which La Gironni\u00e8re has described from his own experience. (2)\n\n(1) Mouat, Adventures p. 315.\n(2) La Gironni\u00e8re was wounded in the finger by one of these arrows, in the removal of the skeleton of an Aita (the first that was sent to Europe and which is now at the Paris Museum). He took no notice of the wound which he took for the scratch of a thorn. After three days, however, the poison began to act, and fearful suffering ensued: the whole arm was inflamed and the pain extended to the chest. After a whole month of torture, the sick man was reduced to the last extremity. He recovered, however, but, for more than a year, he felt pains in the chest. These symptoms recall, in no way, what travellers and experimenters tell us of the effect of known poisons. It would seem as if the poison used by Aitas was of a special kind. But perhaps also the treatment had something to do with the sufferings of the intrepid traveller.\nPoison is also employed by the Manthras (1) and other Bermun tribes. But these half-bred Negritos, although knowing the use of bows and arrows, have substituted the blow-pipe for them. (2) In this case, as in many others, we can easily detect the influence of the Malays.\n\nThese Malacca Negritos are also acquainted with the art of setting snares for big game, some of them being strong enough to capture even tigers. They place at the end of a long path, artificially made in the jungle, a strong spear fixed to a tree which is bent back and kept in position by the means of a catch. Any animal passing by, releases the spring, and is instantly transfixed. (3) In India, now-a-days, as in the time of Cr\u00e9sias, the bow is, so to speak, the characteristic weapon of the Dravidian races. The Gonds seem to be the only ones who have given it up and taken to the use of the axe and pike. (4)\n\nIV.\n\nRELIGIOUS AND MORAL CHARACTERISTICS.\n\nBelief in Superior Beings.\u2014Like many other wild races, the Negritos, to whom these chapters are specially devoted, have often been represented as perfect atheists. This is anything but accurate. We must not, in our appreciation of their rudimentary beliefs, start from the ideas which educated Europeans form of religion, even when they declare themselves unbelievers.\n\nOn the strength of assertions made by a Sepoy deserter who had lived for some time with the Minicopies, some writers have, even quite recently, taken for granted that these islanders do not believe in any superior being who has any influence, bad or good, on their\n\n(1) Montano, loc. cit., p. 47.\n(2) Montano; Logan, loc. cit., p. 272.\n(3) Logan, loc. cit., p. 257.\n(4) Rousselet, Tableau des Races de l'Inde Centrale (Revue d' Anthropologie, Vol. II, p. 276).\nTHE PIGMIES.\n\ndestiny. They forget the formal evidence given by Symes, which I think right to reproduce textually:\n\n\"Their religion is the simple but genuine homage of nature, expressed in adoration to the sun as the primary and most obvious source of good; to the moon as the secondary power; and to the genii of the woods, the waters and the mountains, as inferior agents. In the spirit of the storms they confess the influence of a malignant being, and during the south-west monsoon, when tempests prevail with unusual violence, they deprecate his wrath by wild chorus, which they chant in small congregations assembled on the beach or some rock that overhangs the ocean.\" (1)\n\nThe late statements furnished by Messrs. St. John and Day have still further confirmed the above account of Colonel Symes.\n\nWhen the question has been more thoroughly studied as in other places, we shall perhaps ascertain the existence of a complete rudimentary mythology among the Mincopies. We know as yet, through Mr. Man, that they have preserved some tradition of a deluge. In the south-east of Middle Andaman, they point out a rock, called Wota-Emeda, on which the first man made his appearance and engraved the history of the creation. Mr. Man has visited this Mincopie Eden, and has given a description of it. It is an isolated boulder of small proportions, the surface of which is covered with irregular grooves due to the action of the waves and storms. (2) Let us hope that Mr. Man will enter into more detail respecting the fables connected with it. (3)\n\n---\n\n(1) Account of the British Embassy to the Kingdom of Ava, p. 282. Major Symes gives the information furnished to him by Captain Stookes, who had resided for several years in the Andamans and taken great interest in the natives.\n\n(2) The Andaman Islands. (The Journal of the Anthropological Institute, Vol. VII, pp. 105 and 455).\n\n(3) This paper was originally published in August, 1882. Since then I have read in \"The Journal of the Anthropological Institute,\" (Vol. XII, Nos. I II and III), the very remarkable paper of Mr. Man \"On the Aboriginal Inhabitants of the Andaman Islands.\" Unfortunately the first number, though bearing the same date as mine, was issued some time after, and I was consequently unable to profit by the valuable and detailed account given in it. However, far from altering my essential conclusions, it fully confirms the opinion which I had always maintained touching the religious feelings\nWith regard to the Aetas, our present knowledge is less advanced. M. Montano says in his notes that he could find among them no form of worship; but judging from personal experience, he refrained from concluding that they were wholly destitute of any beliefs whatever. (1) La Gironni\u00e8re, while declaring that these diminutive Negroes have no religion, informs us that, at times, they worship rocks and trunks of trees which seem to bear resemblance to animal beings. (2) My impression is that in all probability, this homage is paid to something higher than these material objects, perhaps to the spirits or genii of the mountains and forests, for Rienzi tells us that these savages believe in evil spirits called Nonos, to whom they offer up sacrifices. (3)\n\nThis belief in spirits is current among the Bermun tribes, and consequently among the Sakais, Manthras, &c. Here it is professionally represented by a body of priests or rather wizards called\n\nof the Andamanese. Where certain travellers had only seen most wretched savages, where I had myself only suspected confused but genuine notions, we find in reality a pretty complete mythology and a belief in a true God, invisible, immortal and omniscient, by whom the whole world was created and whom they call P\u00e1-luga. I shall quote Mr. Man's own words (No. II, p. 157):\n\n\"Of P\u00e1-luga they say that:\n\nI.\u2014Though His appearance is like fire, yet He is (now-a-days) invisible.\n\nII.\u2014He was never born and is immortal.\n\nIII.\u2014By Him the world and all objects, animate and inanimate, were created, excepting only the powers of evil.\n\nIV.\u2014He is regarded as omniscient while it is day, knowing even the thoughts of their hearts.\n\nV.\u2014He is angered by the commission of certain sins, while to those in pain or distress he is pitiful, and sometimes deigns to afford relief.\n\nVI.\u2014He is the Judge from whom each soul receives its sentence after death, and, to some extent, the hope of escape from the torments of Jer'eg-lir-migu (regarding which anon) is said to affect their course of action in the present life.\n\nThis Jer'eg-lir-migu is a kind of hell or purgatory which the Minopies consider as a cold and icy region.\n\n(1) M. Montano had been told that the Bagobogos had no religion. Owing to favourable circumstances he was able to recognise among them a well-defined and anything but rudimentary religious conception, of which he gave us an outline in one of his addresses to the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de G\u00e9ographie,\" 1877.\n\n(2) Loc. cit., p. 300.\n\n(3) Loc. cit., p. 303.\nPoyang or Pawang. After having given, on this subject, many details, which I need not repeat here, Logan sums up his impressions in the following terms:\u2014\u201cAmong these tribes, we recognise \u201ca pure Schamamism with its accompanying charms and talismans; \u201ca living faith fresh from ancient days of Eastern and Middle Asia, \u201cpreserving its pristine vigour and simplicity, \u2026\u2026\u2026 untouched \u201cby the Budhistic deluge \u2026\u2026\u2026 and resisting the pressure of the \u201cIslamism which surrounds it.\u201d (1)\n\nI hardly need remark that among most Dravidian tribes, even among those who have reached a certain standard of civilization, we can detect, in spite of the influence of different Hindu or Mohamedan sects, a substratum of various beliefs similar to those I have just recorded.\n\nBelief in a future life.\u2014All Negritos believe that the soul survives the body; that it has the same wants as the living, and desires that a regard should be manifested for it. Among the Minopies it is customary to place a vessel full of water on the grave of the deceased, so that his soul may be able to quench its thirst during the night; a fire is lighted under the stage which bears the body of a chief, in order to prevent his mighty spirit from harming any traveller passing by; the skull and bones, exhumed from the tomb, are worn round the neck as propitiatory to the spirit of the dead; the soul of a stranger is looked upon as harmless, and therefore the body of any one who dies away from his tribe is left unburied. (2)\n\nThe Actas show great respect to the dead. \u201cFor several \u201cyears,\u201d says La Gironni\u00e8re, \u201cthey deposit tobacco and betel on \u201cthe tombs. The bow and arrows which belonged to the departed \u201care suspended over his grave, on the day of the funeral, and every \u201cnight, according to the belief of his friends, he leaves it and \u201cgoes out hunting.\u201d (3)\n\n(1) The Binua of Johore. Loc. cit., p. 282.\n(2) The details are borrowed from Mr. Day\u2019s memoir. They have all the more weight that the writer gave them \u201cen passant\u201d and without having apparently understood their real importance. Observations on the Andamanese, loc. cit. p. 165).\n(3) Vingt ann\u00e9es aux Philippines, p. 301.\nThe Malacca Negritos do not appear to entertain such well-defined ideas. Logan states that the Berman tribes light a fire on the tomb, for several consecutive nights, in order to prevent the spirit from crying out. (1) M. Montano adds that the Manthras bury their dead sufficiently far from the houses, \"so that they shall not be troubled by the crowing of the cocks.\" (2) But neither of these two writers makes any mention of offerings being presented to the spirit of the departed, though among the Manthras the grave is evidently the object of peculiar attentions. (3)\n\nChastity, Modesty.\u2014M. Montano has given us his experience regarding the chastity of the Aeta damsels. The testimony of Symes leaves no room for doubt that this virtue is found among the Andamanese. Two Mineopic girls who had been taken as prisoners on board an English man-of-war, were soon tranquillised in many respects, but though they had been put by themselves in a separate room, they never went to sleep both at the same time, but watched alternately over each other. (4) Not one of the travellers who have visited the Andamans up to the present time has ever reported having witnessed any of those scenes and scandalous sights so often alluded to by the discoverers of the Pacific Archipelagoes. In that respect, the Mineopic women are unquestionably superior to the Polynesians.\n\nWant of decency is the most common of all the accusations which have been brought against a whole host of wild tribes. But we know that travellers have often been mistaken, so far indeed as to take for the height of immodesty what, in the eyes of the natives, was but an elementary act of decency.\n\nOn this particular point, we lack information with regard to most Negrito races. But as to the Andamans, where the dress of the women is as limited as possible, we know now, thanks to Mr. Man,\n\n(1) Loc. cit., p. 271.\n(2) Loc. cit., p. 49.\n(3) Montano, loc. cit., p. 50, and Fig. 52, 53, 54 and 55. [But see Mr. Hervey's description of a Jakun tomb in No. 8 of this Journal.\u2014Ed., Journ. Straits Branch, R. A. S.]\n(4) Loc. cit., p. 243.\nthat such a dress does exist and bears a particular name (1) and\nthat appearing without it is considered as indecent. (2)\n\nThough displayed otherwise than with us, modesty nevertheless\nexists among the Andamanese.\n\nThe history of a Mincopie, brought over to Europe, shows how\nmuch this sentiment is developed among these islanders. When a\nfull length photograph was taken of Jack Andaman and \"he\nwas told to strip, it was by no means an easy matter to prevail\nupon him to take off his clothes, and, when he was dressed again,\nhe manifested much joy at the restoration of his garments. This\nsavage seemed utterly shocked at the very thought of being\nseen naked.\" (3)\n\nGeneral Character.\u2014It follows, from the various descriptions\ngiven above, that the Negritos, who are the special subject of this\nPart, are far from deserving the accusations which have been too\noften brought against them.\n\nThe Mincopies who have repeatedly been depicted as horrid can-\nnibals, have been found, when more closely examined, to be spoilt,\ncapricious but good tempered children. (4) Mouat describes them\nas a gay, laughter-loving population, fond of singing and dancing.\nFar from being intractable and cruel, they have shown themselves\nkind and hospitable when fear was banished from their hearts.\n\nThe English traveller adds that they are courageous, hardwork-\ning, skilful and extremely active, and, that under the influence of\ncivilization, they would become intelligent and industrious. (5)\n\nM. Montano tells me in his notes: \"Not only are the Negri-\ntos anything but ferocious, but they are really humane. They\nnurse the sick with much devotion, even when they do not\nbelong to their own family.\" He adds again: \"The Manthras\nare not wanting in brain power but carelessness and laziness\n\n(1) Hodda. This girdle varying in shape, is represented in the paper\nquoted above. Pl. XIII, fig. 27 and 27 a.\n(2) Observations on Mr. Man's collection, loc. cit. p. 440.\n(3) Mouat, loc. cit. 284.\n(4) St. John, loc. cit. p. 45.\n(5) Adventures, Preface p. XV.\n\"seem to prevent them from making any progress.\" (1) At the same time he acknowledges among them the gentle and soft manners to which we have already alluded. In this, he agrees entirely with Louan. The latter, however, considers the Berman tribes as inconsistent and irritable. They must, says he, be treated as children. (2) St. John uses the very same expression with regard to the Mincopies. It shows once more that these two groups resemble each other, in their moral as well as their physical characteristics. To deny their fundamental ethnical identity is evidently impossible for any one who has at all studied the question.\n\nConclusion.\u2014However, incomplete this study may be, the conclusion to be drawn from it seems to me to be obvious and easy to formulate. From nearly unanimous testimony, these races have been considered as occupying one of the last stages in humankind. When attention was originally directed to the Mincopies, some learned men of unquestionable merit, were led to believe that the missing link between the man and the monkey had been found at last. We have now seen that this is not so and that, even where furtherest removed from change and from mixture with other races, the only things which ennoble a community, the Negritos prove to be true and real men in every respect.\n\nPART IV.\n\nTHE NEGRILLOS OR AFRICAN PIGMIES.\n\n1.\n\nThe African dwarfs of whom the Ancients had a glimpse and the very genuine existence of whom has given rise to so many legends, were only discovered again by modern generations at a late period.\n\n(1) Montano, loc. cit. p. 47.\n(2) Loc. cit. p. 269.\nIn 1625, Battel first made known certain facts ascertained by him in the Loango.\n\nAt eight days' march to the east of Cape Negro, (1) is found, according to him, the Mani-Kesock territory, to the north-east of which \"lives a race of Pigmies, called Motimbos.\" Their stature hardly exceeds that of an ordinary boy of twelve, they are all most uncommonly stout. They feed on the flesh of animals which they kill with arrows. They pay to Mani-Kesock a tribute of elephants' tusks and tails. Though their disposition is by no means fierce they absolutely refuse to enter into the houses of the Marambas or receive them in their own towns. The women are as skilful as the men in archery, and are not afraid of penetrating alone into the depth of the woods, with no other protection than their poisoned arrows. (2)\n\nWithout mentioning the source of his information, Dapper gives details of the same kind regarding the Minos or Bakk\u00e9-Bakk\u00e9s whom he places a little further south, in the very heart of Loango. (3)\n\nMore recent observations, the latest of which does not go back farther than 1861, (4) have come to hand to confirm these ancient data. The Bakk\u00e9-Bakk\u00e9s of Dapper were discovered again in Loango, under the name of Bakonkos, by a German expedition who brought back portraits and photographs. (5)\n\n---\n\n(1) Andrew Battel, an English sailor, taken prisoner by the Portuguese in 1589, was carried away to Congo, where he remained a captive for nearly eighteen years. He published his adventures in Purchas' collection. Walckenaer gave a detailed summary of this narrative after calling attention to the evident veracity which characterises it.

Hartmann, Die Negrillos, Pl. XIII. These and many of the following bibliographical references regarding the history of Western N\u00e9grillos are borrowed from M. Hamy's work.\nDr. Touchard has remarked on the recent disappearance of a Gabonese race, the Akosas (1) a small group of whom were nevertheless in 1868, still established in the woods north of the river Nazareth. Admiral Fleuriot de Langle was able to photograph one of them who was a real dwarf. (2) It is the same with regard to the M'Boulous, Chekianis or Osi\u00e9kanis visited by M. M. Touchard (3) and Marche. (4) Smothered between the Fans and the Pongoes, they are fast dying out like their brethren, the Akosas.\n\nBy grouping together the information procured by these various photographs and descriptions, M. Hamy has been able to draw an almost complete portrait of some of these African dwarfs. The Akos, examined by Admiral Fleuriot, \"seemed to be forty years old and was from 1m 39 to 1a 40 in height. He was most beautifully proportioned......He had a fairly good head, his hair was well placed, and less woolly than those of Negroes properly so called; the nose was straight and the commissure of the lips well defined, exhibiting in no way the bestial stamp so common with certain African types.\" (5) The photograph justifies this description. The head is globular, but relatively strong. The length of it, as compared to the total height of the individual comes very close to the ratio already mentioned by M. Hamy with reference to a Babongo (1/6). (6) The countenance is just a little prognathous. The muscles of the thorax and upper limbs present outlines at the same time developed and rounded; the lower limbs however are more slender, the feet are decidedly flat, and the heels rather too projecting.

M. Marche also confines himself to saying that the M' Boulos hardly exceed 1m 60. Dr. Falkenstein is more precise. The adult Babonko, whom he photographed, was about forty years of age and measured 1m 365. (2)\n\nThe average of these four figures is 1m 428; but as two of them have been given as maxima, we are entitled to consider this average as too high. With regard to stature, the Negrillos of this region would therefore be below Negritos and would come nearer to the Bushmen, who are perhaps the shortest race of men, their mean height being as low as 1m 370. (3)\n\nBut the Negrillos differ from the Bushmen in a most essential anatomical characteristic. These latter are strictly dolichocephalic or sub-dolichocephalic, (4) whereas, on the contrary, the Akos, the Bongos,...&c., are brachycephalic or at least sub-brachycephalic. (5) The measurements of the skulls, brought back by Admiral Fleuriot, M. Marche and others, have removed all doubt as to this fact which a simple glance at the photographs is sufficient to prove. (6)\n\nM. Hamy has not contented himself with recognising and defining the Negrillo type of the tribes that have maintained a comparative purity of blood in Gaboon, lower Ogou\u00e9 and Loango; he has traced it much farther and has shown that it has had a real and important influence on the formation of several of the popula-\n\n---\n\n(1) Hamy, loc. cit., p. 86.\n(2) The other individual was a young man of fifteen years old who measured 1m 625 only. (Hamy, loc. cit., p. 82.)\n(3) We shall see further on that the Akkas seem to stand below the Bushmen in this respect.\n(4) Their average horizontal index, 77.45, places them in this last category (Crania ethnica, p. 398).\n(5) Their average horizontal index, 83.23, raises them to the upper limit of sub-brachycephalism. (Crania ethnica, p. 350.)\n(6) Among others, the photograph given in the work of Admiral de Langle above quoted.\ntions of the same region and adjacent territories, who are connected with the negro type proper. Availing himself again of materials of all kinds, M. HAMY has proved that crossing of dolichocephalic with brachycephalic Negroes could alone account for the general mixture of characteristics, especially for the morphological differences in the skull, remarked, instance after instance, among various tribes of the valley of the Ogoou\u00e9 of Fernand-Vaz. (1) I need not follow him here in all the details which have brought him to this general conclusion, but will state one single fact only. When M. M. DE BRAZZA and BALLAY returned from the perilous journey, which was rewarded by the discovery of the Alima and the Licona, they found, on an island of the Upper Ogoou\u00e9, four skulls and one complete skeleton which are now in the anthropological gallery of the Museum. Two out of these five skulls, have an average horizontal index of 82.24, thus approaching very closely to true brachycephalism. (2) The three others are dolichocephalic. The former are the skulls of Negrillos the latter of Negroes.\n\nLet us add that the observations, gathered by M. MARCHE among the N'Javis, the Apindjis, the Okotas and the Okoas, show that among these races, who have the skull relatively full, there is a sensible falling off in stature. (3) With the N'Javis, it hardly\n\n(1) I should mention, among others, the study made by M. HAMY of the craniometrical results which Professor OWEN obtained by examining a collection brought from these regions by M. DE CHAILLU. The English savant had published the rough figures which he confirmed calculated the indices and showed that out of the 19 skulls, which formed the collection, 49 only were dolichocephalic or sub-dolichocephalic, 11 sub-brachycephalic, and 2 brachycephalic. The intervention of an ethical element belonging to this last type is shewn clearly by this discussion which M. HAMY has made the starting point of his studies on the same subject. (Note sur l'existence des N\u00e8gres brachycephales sur la c\u00f4te occidentale d'Afrique, in the Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Anthropologie, 2me s\u00e9rie, vol. VII, p. 210.)\n\n(2) HAMY, Note sur l'existence des N\u00e8gres brachycephales &c., p. 96.)\n\n(3) M. HAMY thinks that these tribes are allied to the Obongos seen by DU CHAILLU, near Niembonai in the Ashango land, (1\u00b058'54\" south latitude and 11\u00b056'38\" east longitude). Those Obongos belong in fact to the small sized populations we are examining now. The young adult male measured by the traveller, was 1m.366 only, and one of the women, 1m.340. But the dirty yellow colour of their skin and especially their short hair, growing in small frazzled tufts, had led to connecting these dwarfs with the BUSUMEN. However, DU CHAILLU has not mentioned the characteristic apron and steato-\nreaches 1 m 60. Among the Akoas, the average height of the men varies from 1 m 50 to 1 m 52, that of the women being 1 m 40 to 1 m 43.\n\nAt the same time, the complexion is lighter, prognathism diminishes and the general outline is elegant especially among the women, whose rounded faces have a pleasant expression. It is evident that the negro type proper is modified in places by a distinct ethnological element, and we may consider the whole of this region as having been in former times, and still being to some extent, a centre of a Negrillo population. I shall further on refer again to the distinction which has thus to be made between the past and the present.\n\nI am inclined to consider as a centre of the same kind, another small territory, the Tenda-Mai\u00e9, situated much further north and west, in a bend of the Rio-Grande. Mollien, who visited these regions in 1818, says \"there is but little uniformity in the general characteristics of the physiognomy of these Negroes but the natives of the village of Faran are remarkable for their small stature, slender limbs and the softness of their voice. They are the true African Pigmies.\" However incomplete this short description may be, it is easy to see that Tenda Mai\u00e9 is inhabited by a mixed population, of which these Pigmies are an element.\n\nAlthough Tenda Mai\u00e9 is somewhat distant from the spot where the Nasamons (*) of Herodotus were taken prisoners, yet it is difficult not to connect the diminutive men alluded to by the Greek historian with Mollien's Pigmies. The upper basins of the Rio-Grande and Niger are not far apart and we may admit, without difficulty, that they were inhabited, in former days, by men of the same race.\n\n(*) As existing among the women though he saw them quite close. Some uncertainty, which cranial measurements alone could remove, still prevails therefore with regard to the ethnical affinities of the Obongos. (Du Chaillu, L'Afrique sauvage, p. 260.)\n\n(*) March\u00e9 Trois voyages dans l'Afrique occidentale, p. 342.\n\n(*) Voyage dans l'int\u00e9rieur de l'Afrique, aux sources du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal et de la Gambie, second edn. vol. II, p. 216. The village of Faran is situated about 11\u00b0 15' west longitude and 10\u00b0 68' north latitude.\n\n(*) Vidal Part I, p.\nThe Gaboon, the Ogoou\u00e9 and the Loango are a long way from Tenda Mai\u00e9, and the existence of Negrillo tribes has never as yet been reported within these limits. I am, however, inclined to believe that all these races of low stature are closely allied one with another. We know that the whole of the Guinea coast has been the scene of successive invasions which have brought the conquering tribes of the interior up to the sea-coast. The purpose of the movement of these swarms of tribes, and their murderous customs, of which the Dahomeyans of our own times still furnish a well known example, explain easily how a comparatively feeble race could, and in fact did disappear over a considerable area. The extinction of some of these tribes has just been carried out in our own generation and under our very eyes. It was no doubt one of the last scenes of a drama, the first acts of which were enacted far back in the past.\n\nI shall not enter into more detail, the above being sufficient to lead me to the conclusion that the Negrillos of the Rio-Grande and those of the further end of the Gulf of Guinea are closely related with each other and that both have relation to the small beings described to Herodotus by the Nasamons.\n\nII.\n\nAlmost due East of this Gabonese group of pigmies, there probably exists, in the very heart of Africa, a large centre of Negrillo populations of which the ancients could have had no knowledge. The accounts given to Stanley by Ahmed, son of Djoumah (1) seem to me to be of too precise a nature not to be founded on fact. This ivory merchant had himself seen the small men he spoke of and had had to fight them; he owned having been beaten by them and his statements agree with all the other information collected by the great American traveller. From this ensemble of evidence, it follows that towards the centre of the region comprised within the extensive track of Livingstone, there exists a race of dwarfs called Vouatouas, very numerous, spread over a\n\n(1) Across the Dark Continent, Vol. II, p. 114.\nconsiderable area and in possession of complete independence.\n\n(1) As he passed through Ikoundou, (2) Stanley captured an individual belonging to that or a neighbouring tribe. This Vouatoua measured 1 m 41. His head was large and his face was surrounded with uneven whiskers of a light chocolate-brown colour. Like Batte's little Negroes, these Vouatouas are elephant hunters and use poisoned arrows. This combination of physical and social characteristics connect them evidently with the Negrillos above-mentioned. We shall again find similar traits among their brethren, the descendants of the Pigmies of Homer and Pomponius Mela.\n\nThe tradition referring to the latter is by no means lost; it has been kept up, in particular, by the Arab geographers who have placed a river of the Pigmies in the South of Abyssinia. The Reverend Father L\u00e9on des Avanchers is of opinion that this river can be identified with a stream springing from the Anko mountains, a little to the north of the Equator. In this region, about 32\u00b0 east longitude, this eminent missionary has placed his Wa-Berikinos, (3) also called Cinault\u00e9s, which literally means what a wonder! He also saw, in the kingdom of G\u00e9ra, several of these dwarfs whom he describes as \"deformed, thick-set beings, with large heads, and at the most four feet in height\" (about 1 m 30) (4).\n\nThe particulars collected by M. d'Abbadie from Amace, ambassador of the King of Kullo, and from a woman a native of the neighbouring territory of Kaffa, (5) corroborate the preceding statements. The Malas or Maz\u00e9 Mal\u00e9es would stand a little over\n\n---\n\n(1) In Stanley's large Map this region is placed in about 9\u00b0 south latitude and 19\u00b0 east longitude.

(1)\n\nThe data, which my eminent colleague has been good enough to give me, seem to take these diminutive Negroes a little further North. But, even so, this would indicate that here, as in Western Africa, they are scattered over a more or less extensive area, and that their tribes bear different names. Everything, therefore, tends to show that, to the south of the Gallas countries, there exists a centre of a Negrito population, and I do not think I am too bold in connecting these eastern tribes with the Pygmies of Pomponius Mela, just as I have compared the small beings of Herodotus with the dwarfs of Senegambia. It is useless, I think, my repeating here, in support of this opinion, the arguments which I have mentioned above.\n\nWe know that it is particularly the Pygmies of Homer, living in the marshy region of the Nile, who have attracted the attention of commentators. I have before this recalled the opinions expressed by Buffon and Roulin on this subject. (2) The paper of the Abb\u00e9 Banier sums up the various interpretations offered by other savants, who, also regarding these legends as having a certain groundwork of truth, have tried to identify the dwarfs of mythology with some of the populations known to the ancients. (3)\n\nIt is hardly necessary to add that these conjectures, which were based on no solid foundation whatever, could lead to no valuable result, and it is easy to understand why earnest investigators should have rejected, as groundless, all that had been said on the subject. It was reserved for modern exploration to give another direction to these researches and to lead to positive conclusions.\n\nIn fact, the further travellers have penetrated in the regions of the Upper Nile, the more evidence they have been able to collect\n\n(1) M.

The author endeavours to prove that Pygmies have really existed and are to be looked for in ancient Ethiopia. He identifies them with the Pachinians of Ptolemy.\nwith regard to these small sized populations. The existence of true Pigmies thus became more and more probable; so much so that in some instructions framed by a committee of the \"Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences\" for the exploring expedition of M. d'Escayrac de Lauture, the compiler took care to draw the attention of the traveller to this particular point. (1) But we know that it has been in vain that Europeans have travelled up the Nile and have even reached its source; they have never come across these small beings. Speke alone saw, at the court of Kamrasi, a deformed dwarf of whom he gives a portrait. But this drawing and accompanying explanation show that Kymenla, far from belonging to a race of Pigmies, was not even aware of the existence of these diminutive Negroes. (2)\n\nIt is Schweinfurth to whom is due the honour of demonstrating that the myth of Homer concealed a reality, and of proving the words of Aristotle. But to do this he had to cross over from the watershed of the Nile to that of the Oueli\u00e9, to go beyond the land of the Niam-Niams and reach the country of the Monboutous which he was the first to visit. It was at the court of Mounza that he discovered this dwarfish race, still known there under the name of Akkas, the very name which Mariette had read at the side of the portrait of a dwarf on a monument of the old Egyptian empire.\n\nFrom the information given to Schweinfurth by Adimokou, chief of the small colony which Mounza keeps near his royal residence, it would seem that the land of the Akkas or Tiki-Tikis, (3) is situated about 3\u00b0 North latitude and 25\u00b0 East longitude. This country is no doubt pretty extensive. Living on amicable terms with the surrounding populations, and protected by their mighty neighbour, the Akkas seem to occupy here a continuous area and\n\n(1) Comptes rendus de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences.

(1)\n\nAt the time of Schweinfurth's visit, these people were, partially at least, under the authority of Mounmeri, one of Mousza's vassals, who came to pay homage to his suzerain at the head of a perfect regiment of these small Negroes, so that the European traveller was able to see, at the same time, several hundreds of these dwarf warriors. (2)\n\nIn exchange for one of his dogs, Schweinfurth obtained from Mounza one of the Akkas of whom he had made a portrait. (3) He intended bringing him over to Europe, but the unfortunate Ns\u00e8vou\u00e9 died of dysentery at Berber, South of Khartoum. His skeleton may perhaps one day be found by some traveller and brought to some Museum where it will furnish to science the anatomical indications which are still wanting concerning these people.\n\nThe only records we have as yet, with respect to the Akkas, proceed from the examination of living subjects, and are very few in number. The notes and measurements taken by Schweinfurth were burnt in the unlucky fire which destroyed the fruit of three years' arduous work and toil, and it was anything but easy to make up, even partially, for such a loss. However, M. Marno had the\n\n(1) Schweinfurth, Au c\u0153ur de l'Afrique, p. 110. This journey is one of the most remarkable among those which have so rapidly increased our knowledge of Central Africa. It lasted from the beginning of July, 1868, to the early part of November, 1871, and the greater part of it was made in countries entirely unexplored up to that time by Europeans. The traveller had gathered splendid collections of animals and had made numerous observations, notes, drawings, maps, etc. Nearly all of these scientific treasures were unfortunately destroyed by fire. We can well imagine the grief of the savant thus reduced to relate his travels from memory. His work is none the less most valuable on account of the information obtained about regions which until then were utterly unknown.\n\n(2) Schweinfurth, Au c\u0153ur de l'Afrique, p. 115.\n\n(3) Id. p. 64. Schweinfurth has given a full height portrait of another Akka called B\u00f4mbi. (Id. p. 121).\n\nSince Mounza has learnt the value attached to Akkas, as objects of curiosity, he occasionally gives them as presents to the ivory merchants who visit him every year. This is how one of these individuals arrived at Khartoum; he had been sent to the Governor of the Soudan by Emir-Bey (Doctor Schnitzor). M. Vossion, the French Vice-Consul, gave a brief description of him in a letter to which I will refer hereafter.\ngood luck, during one of his travels, of coming across two Akka female slaves, a young girl and an adult woman. (1) Another woman, Saida, sent to Italy by Gessi-Pacha, was thoroughly examined by M. Giglioli. (2) M. Chaillet-Long-Bey saw also a woman who had accompanied one of Mounza's sisters to the country of the Niams-Niams. (3) M. Vossion, French Vice-Consul at Khartoum, has given, in a letter that was put at my disposal, a brief description of a grown-up man. But, though these records may corroborate and complete each other, still they would be quite insufficient, had not a favourable circumstance occurred, which furnished European anthropologists with the means of studying personally the curious race under remark.\n\nA traveller, more courageous than learned, M. Miani, had followed on the footsteps of Schweinfurth and also reached the country of Momboutous. Less fortunate than his predecessor, he broke down from fatigue, and died, bequeathing to the Italian Geographical Society, two young Akkas whom he had exchanged for a dog and a calf. (4) After various vicissitudes, Tebo and Chairallah, were taken charge of by a man of science and feeling, Count Miniscalchi-Erizzo, who had them brought up under his direction. They could thus be followed and studied at leisure. Their photographs were at the same time profusely distributed by the Geographical Society, and attracted, on all sides, the attention of anthropologists.

Schweinfurth, Owen, Cornalia and Panceri, who happened, by chance, to be at\nfirst to remove all doubt as to the reality of Schweinfurth's discovery. Some persons considered the individuals previously measured by travellers as mere children and believed that Tebo and Chairallah would grow taller. (1) The former of these two suppositions could not stand before the accurate statements made by Marno, on the observations of MM. Giglioli and Chaillet-Longo on three women, and those of M. Vossion on a man; as for the second hypothesis, it was refuted by one of the two Akkas himself, who, as he grew older, never exceeded or even reached the maximum height recorded by Schweinfurth. (2)\n\nThe Russian traveller measured six adults; none of them, says\n\nthe same time in Egypt. Their observations were published in the Bulletin de l'Institut Egyptian in 1873 and 1874.

The Anthropological Society of Madrid seems to have shared the doubts entertained by the Roman Doctor.\n\n(2) Some doubts have been entertained as to the purity of type of Miani's Akkas. M. Hamy expresses on this particular point, (loc. cit., p. 97) a reservation which is not perhaps entirely without ground with regard to Chairallah. On the other hand, his cephalic index is rather low (77.52); MM. Mantegazza and Zannetti, in their exhaustive work on these Akkas, grounding their opinion on the supposed age of the two subjects and the general laws of growth, had predicted that Tebo would stop below Chairallah (loc. cit., p. 144). The event has confirmed their prediction; Chairallah, still growing, had reached 1m42, whereas Tebo, who has all the characteristics of an adult, and seems to have finished growing, has stopped at 1m11 (Giglioli, loc. cit., p. 406). Moreover, the latter has a very high index (80.23). Therefore, if any doubt can still be said to exist with regard to Chairallah, who may perhaps have been affected by intermixture with a full-blood Negro element, such a supposition can however not apply to Tebo himself.\nhe, exceeded 1m50. (1) The one measured by M. Vossion, was 32 years old and 1m31 in height. Tebo, the older of Miani's Akkas, with all the characteristics of an adult, has stopped growing at 1m41, which is the average for the three figures above. (*)\n\nThe woman measured by Marnd, was from 20 to 25 years of age and came up to 1m36 (*); the one of Chaille-Long was 1m216; Saida, 1m34 (*); the mean height thus being 1m302. The average for both sexes would be 1m356. These figures bring the Akkas, with regard to stature, perceptibly below the Minopies, and even slightly under the Bushmen, who, to this day, have been looked upon as the smallest people on earth. But the measurements obtained, up to now, among intertropical Pigmies are not numerous enough to allow of this fact being definitively accepted by science. (5)\n\nSchweinfurth describes the Akkas as having a very large head, a wide and nearly spheroidal skull. (*) The latter feature has certainly been exaggerated. The highest index, ever measured on the body, is given by Marnd's figures and only reaches 82-85, which amounts to about 80-85 for the dry skull. The average, for three young subjects, is 78-03, that is, over 76-00 for the dry skull. (7) This result, far from indicating the true dolicocephalism which distinguishes full-blooded Negroes, agrees on the contrary with the figures that distinguish the Negrillo type as shown above. According to Schweinfurth again, the complexion of the Akkas recalls the colour of slightly burnt coffee. The observations made on\n\n---\n\n(1) Loc. cit., p. 151.\n(2) Giglioli, loc. cit., p. 406.\n(3) Loc. cit., p. 461.\n(4) Loc. cit., p. 410.\n(5) This reservation is all the more justified that no Akka has ever exhibited so low a minimum (1m14) as the female Bushman measured by Barrow and especially as the individual of the same race to whom Doctor Weisbach assigns a stature of 1m only.\n(6) Loc. cit., p. 124.\n(7) In order to bring back the ratio obtained on the living to what it would be on the dry skull, M. Hamy takes into account the small development of the temporal muscles in young subjects, and reduces the index by one unit only, thus considering the average under remark as being 77.00 at least. (loc. cit., p. 98.)\nTEBO and CHAIRALLAH are in accordance with this statement. But Count MINISCALCHI has observed that their skin became much paler in winter time. (1) Their hair is about the same colour, though lighter in the case of CHAIRALLAH. With both it is decidedly woolly and forms gom\u00e9rules; such is also the beard which has grown on TEBO's chin and upper lip. (2)\n\nSCHWEINFURTH has represented Ns\u00e8vou\u00e9 as very prognathic, the nose being aquilino de profil, though the tip is blended with the upper lip (3); the chin is prominent, whereas, with BOBBI, it recedes a good deal and the nose stands out more. (4) In that respect, TEBO's photograph approaches more closely the latter type than the former. (5) The lips are not so thick as with common Negroes, and are even described as thin by M. Vossion and by SCHWEINFURTH as well.\n\nAll statements agree in assigning to the Akkas, men or women, a considerable expansion of the belly which gives to adults the appearance of Negro or Arab children. (6) In the photographs we possess of TEBO and CHAIRALLAH, this feature is most conspicuous. M. PANIZZA, who studied, in an anatomical point of view and by auscultation, the cause of such a development, attributes it to an unusual size of the spleen and of the left lobe of the liver, and also to a large amount of fat accumulated in the mesentery. (7) This distension of the abdomen is attended by consequences which have struck all observers. The chest, comparatively narrow and flat in the upper region, expands lower down so as to encompass this enormous paunch. (8) On the other hand, the protrusion of the belly requires, for the sake of balance in the body, that the lower portion of the spine should\n\n---\n\n(1) Loc. cit., p. 301.\n(2) GIULIOLI, loc. cit., p. 405.\n(3) Loc. cit., p. 64.\n(4) SCHWEINFURTH, loc. cit., p. 121.\n(5) MINISCALCHI, loc. cit., p. 300.\n(6) SCHWEINFURTH, loc. cit., p. 123; MARNO, loc. cit., p. 461; Vossion's unpublished letter.

This we can infer from the personal experience of Count Miniscalchi, who noticed that, after a few weeks of wholesome and regular diet, \"the excessive expansion of the abdomen had disappeared and the spine had resumed its normal state.\" (1)\n\nThe same change has occurred with regard to Sa\u00efda. (2)\n\nIn order to complete the physical description of these Akkas, I need say a few words about their limbs. The upper ones are long, and the hands very delicately shaped. (3) The lower limbs are short as compared with the bust and have a slight inward bend. The feet also are turned in, but more so than with other Africans. (4)\n\n---\n\n(1) This conformation has been the cause of a singular mistake and of a good deal of discussion. In a communication to the Egyptian Institute (5th December, 1873), Schweinfurth had compared this bend of the spine to a C. The eminent traveller evidently alluded to the lower portion of the back and meant to say that the concavity of the C was turned backwards. But, acting under the influence of preconceived ideas, and in the hopes of discovering the missing link, which has been the subject of so much active search for so long, some venturesome minds supposed that the C represented the shape of the whole back, that the concavity was turned forward, and that, consequently, the Akkas bore, in that respect, a great resemblance to anthropomorphic monkeys. Before even having seen their photographs, I had combatted, at the Anthropological Society and elsewhere (loc. cit., p. 1519) this interpretation, which is perfectly incompatible with the mode of locomotion in man and with the agility universally attributed to the Akkas. Broca (loc. cit., p. 284) and also MM. Mantegazza and Zannetti (loc. cit., p. 148) have, later on, given the same arguments in support of our common opinion, which is entirely justified by the present state of knowledge on the subject.\n\n(2) Miniscalchi, loc. cit., p. 299.\n\n(3) Giglioli, loc. cit., p. 410.\n\n(4) Schweinfurth, loc. cit., p. 124. The photographs of Tebo and Chiriballe do not justify this compliment, any more than the cast made of Tebo.\n\n(5) Schweinfurth, loc. cit., p. 123.\nThe Akka women bear a great resemblance to the men. M. Giglioli speaks of Sa\u00efda as having a thick waist, short neck, arms neither slim nor long and hands rather large than otherwise. Her complexion, as with Chatballah, is that of a mulatto; her hair is of a fuliginous black and the grom\u00e9rules are not so distinct; prognathism rather more defined. (1) This description agrees perfectly with the portrait given by M. Chaille-Long, who adds that, in the case of his Tiki-Tiki woman, the breasts were very flaccid, though she vowed never having had any children. (2)\n\nThe physiological characteristics of Akkas resemble those of most savages. Their senses are extremely acute, and Schweinfurth repeatedly bears witness to their excessive agility. According to the Monboukous, these little creatures are wont to bound in the tall grass, after the manner of grasshoppers. (3) Ns\u00e8vou\u00e9 had, in a certain measure, kept up that habit and during the time he stopped with Schweinfurth, was never able to bring a dish without spilling part of its contents. (4)\n\nThe Akkas are very courageous. \"They are men, and men who know how to fight,\" said Moum\u00e8bi speaking of his followers. (5) They are great elephant hunters and will attack them with a very short bow, and spears hardly as high as themselves. (6) Long-Bey corroborates this statement and adds that the women are as martial as the men and this again fully confirms the information given by Battel. (7)\n\nSchweinfurth draws a miserable picture of the character and intellect of Ns\u00e8vou\u00e9. He describes him as enjoying the sight of\n\n(1) Loc. cit., p. 410.\n(2) Loc. cit., p. 269.

(1) Miniscalchi, on the contrary, found Tebo and Chaiballah to be affectionate and grateful pupils, always ready to improve themselves. Both of them, especially Tebo, had a great taste for music. Two years after their arrival in Europe, they knew how to read and write. Their adoptive father showed, in 1879, to one of his colleagues, two letters entirely worded and written out by them without any help whatever; the fac-simile of these specimens was inserted in the proceedings of the Congress. (2) They had not, however, forgotten their mother-tongue and could supply M. Miniscalchi with several hundred words and various information enabling him thus to draw up a grammar which he considers as similar to that of the Niam-Niam language. (3)\n\nWhat have these Akkas become under the influence of a European climate and of an education to which they were submitted, for the first time, these representatives of that ancient and wild race that has settled down at two or three degrees from the Equator? Evidently the question is of great interest, and we must feel grateful to M. Giglioli for having replied to it in detail. (4)\n\nTebo has always borne up very well against the cold winters of Verona. Chaiballah has had ague and cough pretty often; he also suffered from rheumatism for the first two or three years, but both are now perfectly well acclimatized, (5) and so is also Sa\u00efda. (6)\n\n---\n\n(1) Loc. cit., p. 125.\n(2) Loc. cit., p.p. 302 and 303.\n(3) M. Miniscalchi used to converse with them in Arabic, which they speak fluently.\n(4) Gli Akka vicenti in Italia, loc. cit. This memoir was written in 1890, five years after that of Count Miniscalchi.\n(5) Id., p. 407.\n(6) M. Giglioli thought that he could discover, by a simple inspection of the head, that it had grown somewhat longer. The examination of the bust and the measures, necessarily approximative, which I took of this plaster-cast, do not, to my mind, justify this opinion.\nA casting was taken of Tebo, and his bust can be seen at the Museum. By comparing it with the photographs taken in 1874, we see that he has lost somewhat of his infantine looks; his forehead is less prominent, though not so slanting as with Ns\u00e9vou\u00e9. In that respect he comes closer to B\u00f6nni. Prognathism is rather more defined, but the other features are hardly altered. (1)\n\nThese two Akkas have kept a sensitive and unsettled disposition, like that of children. (2) They are fond of play; their motions are rapid, and, in their promenades, they like to run at a double-quick pace. (3)\n\nTebo is more affectionate and studious, and has always behaved himself well. Cnairallah is more intelligent, but has occasionally showed himself spiteful and revengeful. They have, however, never quarrelled with their young friends, and they love each other most tenderly.\n\nBoth of them have been baptized and are observant of their religious duties, though their spiritual leader does not consider their sentiments in that respect as very deeply rooted. (4)\n\nThey have now completely forgotten their mother-tongue, and very nearly all the Arabic they knew. They speak Italian fluently, but experienced at first great difficulty in pronouncing words containing two z (bellezza, carezza).\n\nThey have a great sense of emulation, and, at school, have shown themselves superior to their European companions of ten and\n\n---\n\n(1) Giglioli, loc. cit., p. 410.\n(2) Loc. cit., p. 409.\n(3) The above could also apply to Sa\u00efda. However she was not treated in the same way as her countrymen. She remained a servant and was not taught to read and write. She speaks Italian fluently, and a little German, which is the language of her mistress; she is sometimes capricious and very fond of playing with children. (Giglioli, loc. cit., p. 411.)\n(4) Id., p. 409.\ntwelve years old. The notes which their professor showed to M. Giglioli, prove that they went thoroughly well through the various compositions in arithmetic, parsing and dictation. (1) Countess Miniscalchi gave music lessons to Tebo, and M. Giglioli heard him play, on the piano, some rather difficult pieces, with a certain amount of feeling and a good deal of precision. (2)\n\nIn short, we may conclude that, in spite of their small stature, their comparatively long arms, their large bellies and short legs, the Akkas are real and true men in every respect; those who had looked upon them as half-monkeys must be now completely undeceived.\n\nConclusion.\u2014The foregoing facts seem to convey a few general considerations which I will now briefly summarize.\n\nIn proceeding from Senegambia and Gaboon towards the land of the Gallas and Monbontous, we have verified the true existence of human communities characterized, all of them, by a small stature, a comparatively large and rounded head, a lighter complexion than that of Negroes proper, and by similar instincts and customs. With M. Hamy, we must acknowledge that these groups are as many specimens of a special race, the Negrillos, who are, in Africa, the representatives of the Asiatic and Indo-Melanesian Negritos.\n\nThe ancients evidently possessed more or less accurate information respecting these Negrillos, as well as the Negritos. They were the African Pigmies, but they had been placed in three geographical localities where they are no more to be met with nowadays. In order to find them, we must look to countries which are\n\n(1) Chaimallah had obtained 10 (maximum figure) for dictation and calligraphy; Tebo, also 10 for dictation. Their other notes are 8/10 and 9/10 except for the solution of arithmetic problems, in which Chaimallah comes down to 7/10 and Tebo to 6/10. We find here again a proof of the inferiority of Negro races with regard to science.\n\n(2) Id. p. 209. Their education has unfortunately been stopped at present. Both Chaimallah and Tebo make part of the household in the Miniscalchi family. (Giglioli loc. cit.)\nmuch further from Europe than was supposed in olden times; moreover, these Pigmies appear to us now as forming isolated agglomerations far apart from each other. Lastly, in one of these homes at least, we are able to witness at present the decline of the race and its fusion with a neighbouring element, which is constantly increasing in strength and number.\n\nAll these facts recall vividly the past, and the present fate of the Negritos must naturally be relegated to the same causes. They show us that, in days gone by, the Negrillos were more numerous and formed more compact and continuous communities, and that they must have been driven back and broken up by superior races. Their history, if better known, would most certainly bear a great resemblance to that of their Eastern brethren.\n\nWhat we know of the latter induces to believe that, in the lands where they are still to be found, these Negritos have preceded the races by whom they have subsequently been oppressed, dispersed and almost annihilated. With regard to Negrillos, similar facts must carry with them the same conclusions. We are thus brought to accept as most probable that these small and brachycephalic Negroes originally occupied at least a great part of Africa previous to the full-blooded Negroes characterized by dolicocephalism and a larger stature. The latter correspond with the Papuas, while the Negrillos are the Negritos of Africa.\n\nThis comparison does not arise simply from a superficial inspection of the African and Indo-Melanesian Negroes; it is also justified by the detailed study of skulls which renders evident the striking connection existing between the two great anthropological formations which represent the Negro type at both extremities of our continent. (1)\n\nHow could such a narrow resemblance have occurred between populations which are separated by so vast a space and by such\n\n(1) Crania Ethnica.\nnumerous and different races? Are these affinities the simple result of a common origin? This interrogation, and many others too, had been uttered, even before the late discovery of Negrillos, which has made a reply more urgent than ever. I regret to say that the present state of science does not allow us to offer a satisfactory solution to this problem, assuredly one of the most curious among the many points connected with the geographical distribution of the human race. (1)\n\nThe study of these small negro races suggests one more reflection.\n\nWhen alluding to Pigmies, the ancients mixed up with true facts many exaggerations and fables. Modern science, misled at times by its own strictness, and dwelling solely on the unacceptable points of these traditions, rejected in a lump all the statements regarding the dwarfs of Asia and Africa. The above proves that science was wrong, and this mistake teaches us a lesson.\n\nWhen there is a question of traditions, of legends connected with people less learned than we are, and especially with wild populations, it is but right to examine them thoroughly, however strange\n\n(1) Logan has studied this question from different points of view, and has developed with much science, the theory that the African Negroes have penetrated into Asia and Melanesia through a slow influxion which has been accomplished by sea. He attributes a great influence to the Malagasy population. (The Ethnology of the Indian Archipelago; The Journal of the Indian Archipelago and Eastern Asia, vol. III.; Ethnology of the Indo-Pacific Islands, vol. VII.) Knowles is inclined to admit that the small black man, which makes up in the southerly regions of India, has spread itself East and West in Melanesia and Africa, and that the tall Negroes are descended from it. (On the Osteology and Affinities of the Natives of the Andaman Islands; The Journal of the Anthropological Institute, vol. IX.) Allen also derives the African Negroes from Asia and endeavours to prove that they have left traces of their passage in many parts of intermediate countries. (The Original Range of the Papuan and Negrito Races; The Journal of the Anthropological Institute, vol. VIII.) Professor Seeley thinks that the Negro race occupied, in former times, a strip of land which extended from Africa to Melanesia and is now submerged. (Quoted by Allen; loc. cit., p. 40.)\nand singular they may appear at first. Many of these accounts contain interesting and true information which is often concealed under superstitions, mistakes, forms of language or erroneous interpretations. The duty of the man of science is then similar to the task of the miner who separates gold from its quartz. Very often he also, with a little work and cautious criticism will succeed in redeeming, from a heap of errors, some important truth.\nVALENTYN'S DESCRIPTION OF MALACCA.\n\n[The following paper is a translation by Mr. Muller, Government Translator, of Valentyn's Account of Malacca.\n\nA portion of this has already appeared in Lovat's Journal, Vol. IV, but as it appears that it was never complete, and matter was omitted which some might find interesting, and, further, that the translation was not altogether to be depended on, I have thought it worth while to insert a trustworthy translation of the whole with a few notes.\n\nD. F. A. H.]\n\nABSTRACT, TRANSLATED FROM FRANCOIS VALENTYN'S HISTORY OF MALACCA (ANNO 1726.)\n\nThe town of Malakka is situated in 2\u00b0 20' northern latitude and on 102\u00b0 20' longitude, on the Continental Malay coast, which lies easterly of the East coast of the great island of Sumatra, about 8 miles [leagues?] in a straight line from the opposite shore.\n\nPtolemy and the Ancients gave it the name of \"Terra or Regio Aurifera,\" which means \"the country rich in gold,\" or of \"Aurea Chersonesus,\" i.e., \"The Gold Peninsula,\" making it appear at about the 11th degree, where it is joined by a narrow isthmus to Tenasserim and Siam. It is the most southern territory of India.\n\nIt is situated on the point of a neck of land, between which and the N.E. coast of Sumatra is a fine sound, known by the name of the Straits of Malakka, or otherwise, by that of the Straits of Singapore, after a very ancient town commonly called Singapuri.\n\nIt covers approximately an area of 1,800 paces in circuit, or of about one mile, and has a strong wall on the sea side of about 600 paces long, being also protected by a solid stone wall on the N.W. or river side. There is, moreover, a stone bastion on the N.E. side, called Santo Domingos, and there was another wall, called Tipah, built towards the waterside, and extending to a strong round bastion called St. Jago, now gone to ruins; there were also other fortresses on the S.E. side and two bastions, making it altogether a\nvery strong place, but in time almost all these fortifications have gone to ruins. We do not mention their names now, as they will appear in the course of this description.\n\nThe convent of the Jesuits, also called St. Paul's Convent, was built higher up in town, and the monastery of the Minorites, otherwise called that of Madre de Deus, stood on the adjacent hills.\n\nThe territory belonging to Malakka extends over a length of 30 miles, and over a breadth of about 10 miles. There are two islets in its vicinity, Ilha das Neos, (1) within a gun-shot from the town, and Ilha das Pedras, (2) from where they got the stones to build houses, &c., with, beyond the range of gun-shot. The Portuguese carracks and galleons used to anchor between these two islets in 4 or 5 fathoms of water. (3)\n\nOn the North-West side of the town is a wall with a gate and a small fortified turret, and next to it a river, discharging into the sea, with fresh water at low tide, but with salt water at high tide. Its width is 40 paces, and its current is generally pretty strong. It is commonly called \"Chrysorant,\" and there is another river on the East side. (4)\n\nThe country on the other side of the river (being on the same level with the land where the town is built) is joined to it by a wooden bridge; but the ground is very swampy on the South-East side, being generally flooded in the rainy monsoon, with the exception of a small piece along the beach, which lies somewhat higher.\n\nThere are in the town many fine and broad streets, but unpaved, and also many fine stone houses, the greater part of which are of the time of the Portuguese, and built very solidly after their fashion.\n\nThe town is built in the form of a crescent.\n\nThere is a respectable fortress of great strength, with solid walls and fortified with bastions, well-provided with guns, able to stand with its garrison a hard blow. (5) There are, in the fortress, several strong stone houses and pretty good streets, all remembering the Portuguese times, and the tower, erected on the hill, seems to be\n\n(1) Pulau Jawa.\n(2) Pulau Upeh.\n(3) Only about two fathoms now.\n(4) No traces of this now, except in the large drains near Kampung Jawa, and Banda Hillir.\n(5) The only remains visible of this now are contained in the curious old gateway (near the residence of Mr. J. E. Westerhout) which bears Portuguese arms, but a Dutch date, viz., 1670; this is probably what is left of the bastion called \"Baluarte Santiago\" as marked in the old plates of the Fortress.\nstill pretty strong, though its interior is falling into decay. This fortress, built on the hill in the centre of the town, is about the size of Delfshaven, and has also two gates, and though one of its sides stands on the hill, yet the other side is washed by the sea. It is at present the residence of the Governor, of the other officers employed by the company, and of the garrison, which is pretty strong. Two hundred years ago this place was merely a fishermen's village (1) and now it is a fine town.\n\nIn former times the town had a population of 12,000 souls; but there are now not more than 200 or 300 families, some of which are Dutch and some others Portuguese and Malays, the latter living in the most remote corners of the town in common attap huts.\n\nAt a small distance from the town are also some fine houses and many well-kept cocoanut plantations and gardens with fruit trees, the greater part of which are owned by Malays.\n\nThis town is remarkably well situated for trade, and these straits have been frequented, since the times of old, by much shipping, which still continues from Bengal, Coromandel, Surat, Persia, Ceylon, Java, Sumatra, Siam, Tonkin, China, and from many other countries; the gross revenue in the year 1669 (consisting of 10 per cent. import duty and 3 per cent. export duty, and some other small taxes) amounting to 74,958.18 guilders.\n\nThere arrived in that same year 116 Javanese vessels, besides the Danish, Portuguese and Moorish vessels.\n\nThis place is very convenient for our vessels passing through the Straits of Singapore going from Japan to Bengal, Coromandel, Surat and Persia, and also for vessels bound for Batavia coming from these places.\n\nThe place is not very productive in provisions; everything must be imported from other places, with the exception of fish and some kinds of fruits.\n\nThe productivity of this place is very poor, compared to that of the Coast [of Coromandel], Bengal, Ceylon, &c.; and the surrounding country bears a barren aspect.\n\nIt is also not safe to venture in the jungle, as it abounds in wild beasts.\n\nOne of my friends, Mr. van Naassen, told me, that it once had happened to him in person to fall in with a tiger accidentally, and he was sure on several other occasions of being in the neighbourhood of one of these animals, for it was only in that case his horse\n\n(1) i.e. about 1525, or 14 years after the Portuguese took it, in which case it must have greatly fallen from the state in which they found it.\ngot unmanageable. There are, moreover, many elephants and other wild beasts. This same gentleman has told me also, that he once saw a tiger which made a leap at a deer that tried to escape him in the water; the deer did escape, and the tiger was dragged down by an alligator.\n\nThe East India Company has a Governor at this place, who has supreme authority over all the officers and over all the affairs. He is assisted by a Supercargo (as second in rank), an Attorney-General, (1) a Paymaster, and a staff of officers similar to those mentioned in our account of Ambon, performing almost the same duties and receiving the same pay; there are here, besides, several \"Opperhoofden\" (Commandants) of other places or factories, which are under the authority of this Governor, and also an especial \"Shahbandar\" or Collector of the Custom-house duties.\n\nA Council of Police is constituted from among these officers (as also already mentioned under Ambon) forming the Government of this territory; another Council administers the law; and a third one all the ecclesiastical affairs.\n\nThe Malays of these countries are commonly called \"orang di bawah angin,\" i.e., \"the people below the wind\" (to leeward), or else \"Easterlings,\" whilst those of the Occident, more especially the Arabs, are called \"orang atas angin,\" i.e., \"people above the wind\" or Occidentals; this is not that there are no other tribes of that name, but that these two nations are the most renowned, the most ingenious and the most civilised of that race.\n\nThe Malays are the most cunning, the most ingenious and the politest people of the whole East.\n\nWhether they have been thus called after the country, or whether the country has been called after them, will be shown by and by, when we shall have traced their origin as far back as possible, producing it from their earliest history.\n\nThey are of a rather pale hue and much fairer than other natives of India, also much kinder, more polite, neater in their manner of living, and in general so charming, that no other people can be compared to them. Their language, Bahasa Malayu, i.e., the Malay language (whether called after the people or after the country) was not only spoken on that coast, but was used through the whole of India, and in all the Eastern countries, as a language understood everywhere and by every one, just as French or Latin in Europe, or as the Lingua Franca in Italy or in the Levant, to such an extent even that, knowing that language, one never\n\n(1) Prokureur-Generaal.\nwill be at a loss, it being used and understood in Persia, nay even beyond that country on that side, and also as far as the Philippines.\n\nAnd if you don't understand this language, you are considered a very badly educated man in the East, whilst the Malays are accustomed to study it, trying their utmost to enlarge their knowledge of it and to learn also the Arabic; even some among them the Persian language too, and those who are more studious still strive to obtain the knowledge of the Sanskrit, the mother-language of most of the idioms in the East.\n\nThe Malay is spoken nowhere so correctly and so purely as here, though there is still a great difference between the Court language and that of the lower class. The language spoken by the courtiers is so swelling, so interlarded with Arabic (to show their erudition in that language), and differs so much from the common pure language (the former being the adulterated language), since every nation, that speaks this common or low Malay, has mixed some words of their own language with it, that it would not be understood by the common people, for which reason it is used only by princes, courtiers and priests, and therefore considered as the language of scholars. It is by nature a very pleasant, sweet, charming, and yet a very powerful language to express yourself in. A lot of works written in that language, already mentioned by us before, and several fine songs, in which they have transmitted many events of past times, show this plainly.\n\nThe Malay men are generally dressed in a pair of trousers, with a broad blue, red or green garment, worn as a blouse, and a turban rolled round the head.\n\nThey are commonly of a very lively nature, but they always keep open a back door and are not easily to be caught, while they are witty and of great self-conceit.\n\nI do not know another nation in the Indies more cunning than the Malays and the natives of Macassar, for which reason they are not much to be relied upon.\n\nThe women's dress is almost the same as that of other Indian women, or like that of the Javanese women, and consists in a long gown, hanging down to their feet and very often also fastened above the bosom under the arms, the upper part of the body being naked. They tie up their hair in a bundle at the back of their head, though some have another hair-dress, almost the same as that of the Creoles. These women too are generally of a more excited\nmind than other women of India, and they excel also in loveliness and wit far above others. (1)\n\n(1) The following passage is given in Logan's Journal, p. 700, Vol. IV, but does not occur in my edition of Valentyn, which is dated 1726.\n\nD. F. A. H.\n\n\"The other inhabitants are Portuguese, who are well known, or other Indians, who have been already described as Chinese, Guzerattes, Bengalis, Coast-Moors, Achinese and others.\n\nThe commodities produced here are these:\u2014\n\n\"Kebembak,\" Agila-wood and Camphor in the Kingdom of Pahang, Tin, Gold, Pepper, Pedra de Pareo (Query, Bezoar stones?), Elephant (tusks).\n\nThe imported goods consist of:\u2014\n\n\"All sorts of cloths, more especially Petas Malayu, or Malay cloths.\n\n\"Surat cloths\n\n\"Bengal cloths\n\n\"Guinea cloths (coarse)\n\n\"blue calico\n\n\"Salamponies\n\n\"Ratta Broteja\n\n\"Bethilis\n\nCoast Chintz.\n\nOpium.\n\nRed Woollens.\n\nCopper.\n\nRupees.\n\nReals of eight [Spanish dollars?].\n\nThe charges of the garrison and other expenses run very high, sometimes as much as 200,000 guilders (2 tonnen gouds), the reason of which is, that the clear income during the year is often much less than the outlay.\n\nIn the year 1664 and during several years, the expenses were much higher and it was thought proper to reduce the strength of the garrison and bring the expenses within the sum mentioned, 200,000 guilders.\n\nSubsequently it was deemed proper further to reduce the expenditure by 40,000 guilders. Orders were given by their Excellencies in 1669 to reduce the extent of the fortifications and a certain Ensign (Vaandrig) was established there from the 17th of January of the year and entrusted with the duties of enquirer.\"\n\n* Marsden quotes Loureiro against Valentyn in support of the contention that \"keembak\" and \"gaharu\" (i.e., agila wood or lignumvices) come from the same tree, and are merely different qualities arising from difference in age, &c., and he quotes also, \"Gahru chumpaka agilochum sparium, R.\" But \"keembak\" is the heart of the \"kamb-jo\" tree, known also as \"poko\" bungo kutuban. The heart of the \"chempaka\" tree furnishes the \"kas-tori,\" while the heart of the \"kara\" tree produces all the varieties of \"gaharu,\" which are as follows:\u20141st quality, very black\u2014\"lajapam;\" the 2nd\u2014\"tandok\" or\u2014\"black;\" the 3rd\u2014\"wangkang\" or\u2014\"maya;\" 4th, which is not marketable, but is used privately, is the refuse of the 3rd and is called \"gaharu medang.\"\n\n\u2020 Half wool, half cotton.\n\n\u2021 Indian cotton cloth.

These factories are Perah (Perak), Kedah (Kedah), Oudjong-Salang, (*) and Andragiri. (*)\n\nPerah, the first named Settlement, situated on this Malay Coast, was subjected to the authority of the Queen of Atsjin (Aceh), and was only kept for the tin trade; the Hon'ble Company had appointed there an Underfactor, to purchase that mineral for ready cash, or to barter it against cloths at fifty Rix dollars the bahar, but the nature of that people is very mean and murderous, which it has shown by murdering in 1651 all the people of our factory at that place. Their Honours have often been compelled to order the Governors of this Government (Malakka) to break up quietly that factory and its lodgings, and to try to find an opportunity to avenge this abominable piece of roguery, which was carried out afterwards, and which we will mention with every particular later on.\n\nThe second outer-factory is Quedah (Kedah), also situated on this Coast almost opposite Atsjin. We had there also an Underfactor and a Settlement to barter tin, gold and elephants for the Hon'ble Company; but this small kingdom, gave us also now and then so much trouble, that we have been obliged to break up this factory too.\n\nWe shall meet with the two other factories in our history of Sumatra.\n\n[Here follows a list of the Governors and principal Officials of the Government of Malacca.]\n\nLIST OF THE\n\nGOVERNORS OF MALAKKA.\n\nJohan van Twist, Governor and Extraordinary Member of the Council of India, ... 1641\u20141642\nJeremias van Vliet, Governor and Extraordinary Member of the Council of India in 1645, ... 1642\u20141645\n\n(*) Commonly known as \"Junk Ceylon.\"\n(*) Indragiri.\nArnold de Vlaming van Ontshoorn, Governor and Extraordinary Member of the Council of India, 1645\u20141646\nJohan Thyssoon Paijart, Governor and Extraordinary Member of the Council of India in 1657, 1646\u20141662\nJohan van Riebeek, Commander and President, 1632\u20141665\nBalthasar Bort, Commander and President, ... 1665\u20141668\nPromoted to Governorship, ... 1668\u20141679\nExtraordinary Council of India in 1670 and Ordinary Council of India in 1678.\nJacob Jorissoon Fits, Governor, ... 1679\u20141680\nCornelis van Quaasberg, Governor, ... 1680\u20141684\nExtraordinary Council of India in 1682.\nNicolaas Schaghen, Governor and Extraordinary Council of India in 1682, ... 1684\u20141686\nDirk Komans, Director from 5th January till 26th November, ... 1686\nThomas Slicher, Governor and Extraordinary Council of India, ... 1686\u20141691\nDirk Komans, Director from 18th October, 1691, to 1st October, 1692, ... 1691\u20141692\nGelmer Vosburg, Governor, ... 1692\u20141697\nGovert van Hoorn, Governor, ... 1697\u20141700\nBernard Phoonsen, Governor and Extraordinary Council of India in 1703, ... 1700\u20141704\nJohan Grotenhuys, Director from 18th January to 22nd May, ... 1704\nKarel Bolner, Governor, ... 1704\u20141707\nPieter Rooselaar, Governor and Extraordinary Council of India in 1707, ... 1707\u20141709\nWillem Six, Governor, ... 1709\u20141711\nWillem Moerman, Governor, ... 1711\u20141717\nHerman van Suchtelen Governor, ... 1717\n### SUPERCARGOS OR SECUNDAS.\n\n| Name                        | Years          |\n|-----------------------------|---------------|\n| Johan Verpoorten            | 1641\u20141642     |\n| N.

These three gems (which are now only found in very few libraries), though full of fictions and useless stories, are considered, however, among us as the best historical descriptions written in the Malay language, and which are not only most useful to learn the Malay thoroughly, but in which are also to be found many useful things about the Javanese, Malay and other Kings, not mentioned by another author. The Mohamedan Princes in India and their Priests are almost the unique possessors of those works, and it is the greatest difficulty in the world to get possession of one copy. But I have got them all, as I have mentioned already before, whilst speaking of the Malay language. Though we find in the two first mentioned works and in some other books, particulars clearing up many obscure points, yet the last one mentioned is in this respect the best one, while it gives us all the particulars from the very beginning, even from before the time that it (Malakka) was built, and in quite a decent style (for natives at least).\n\n(1) Hang Toah.\u2014There were nine of these \"hangs,\" champions, of whom an account may be found in Leyden's \"Malay Annals.\" Crawfurd speaks contemptuously of it as a historical work, which it no doubt deserves; but it is useful for the insight it affords into the national customs and manners.\nI really don't know the author of the book *Hangtooha*, but I must admit it to be one of the most decent Malay works I ever have read, of which we will communicate to our readers a summary as briefly as possible.\n\nIf we want to trace scrupulously the origin of the Malays, it is worth while to find out first, whether they derive their name from the country (the Malay Coast and the town of Malacca) or whether that country has been called after them.\n\nThey lived first on the great island of Sumatra (called in former times *Andelis*\u00b9) and also *Maningcaba*,\u00b2 till it was discovered that this was the name of only one kingdom of this island) and there more especially in the kingdom of Palinbang, situated on the inner west coast, at about 8 degrees latitude, opposite the island of Banca, on the river *Maluyo*, which runs all round the mountain *Mahamuroo*,\u00b3 and thence downwards to the river *Tataug* and so on into the sea.\n\n* Every one hearing the name of the first mentioned river, would feel inclined at once to think, that those who had settled there had been called after the said river \"Orang Malayoo,\" i.e., \"the Malayoo people, people living on the river Malayoo,\" others however suppose that that river (also called *Mallajoa* and *Maladjoa*) has received its name from this laborious, industrious, quick and hasty people, while the Malay word for laboriousness and quickness is also *Maladjoa*. But it is my opinion that the Malays got their first name from that river, and that they have given that name afterwards to several coasts and countries where they have settled, though the whole of this country (then nothing but fishermen) has been subdued by the King of Siam, of whom some of these natives have rid themselves a long time afterwards.\n\nAfter having been settled here for some years, without knowing anything about a King to govern them (an obscure period, about which nothing has been mentioned by one author), but not quite pleased with this place, and not always having been left unmolested,\n\n\u00b9 More commonly \"Indalas\" or \"Andalas.\"\n\u00b2 Menangkabau, or Menangkerbau, as to the origin of which name various legends exist, e.g. fight between tiger and buffalo, latter winning; also fight between gigantic Javanese buffalo and buffalo calf, latter victorious; again when Raja was first instituted at Bukit Guntang Peujuringan a buffalo with golden horns and hoofs issued from a hole in the ground with a herd of followers, but returned to it before his pursuers could catch him and so \"menang kerbau.\"\n\u00b3 Mahamuro, the Hindu Olympus.\n\n* This and much of what follows has already been criticised by competent critics, so I will not indulge myself here.\nthey thought it more advisable to elect a King (and such the more while they had greatly increased, whilst still heathens) which first King had the name of Sri Toori Bowana.(1) This Prince has ruled them 48 years, and pretended to be a descendant of Alexander the Great, to whom Demang Laibun Dawang (*) (who then ruled the Malays as a Prince of less fame) resigned his sway, in consideration of his illustrious lineage and while he was a descendant of such a renowned Prince; this happened in about 1160 A.C. (or some years before).\n\nThe Malays crossed under this Prince (Sri Toori Bowana) from the island of Sumatra to the opposite shore, now the Malay Coast, and more especially to its North-East point, known as \"Ordjong Tanah,\" that is, \"the extremity of the country,\" and known among geographers as \"Zir baad\" which means in Persian \"below wind\" (to leeward), hence receiving a long time afterwards also the new name of \"the people below wind\" (to leeward), or else \"Easterlings\" (above all the other nations in the East), from this so-called promontory where they had settled again, the same name having been given afterwards also to some of their neighbours or other Easterlings. This country has generally been known since that time by the name of \"Tanah Malayu,\" i.e., \"the Malay territory\" or else \"the Malay Coast,\" comprising in a larger sense all the country from that very point or from the 2nd degree till the 11th degree North latitude and till Tenasserrim, though, taking it in a more limited sense, only that country is understood, which now belongs under the governorship and jurisdiction of Malacca and its environs; they are also considered above all the real and original Malays and they are, therefore, also called \"Orang Malayu,\" i.e., the Malays, whilst all the other Malays, either closely or far off, as those of Patani, Pahang, Peirah, Keidah, Djohor, Bintam, (*) Lingga, Gampar, (*) Haru, and others in this same country or on the islands of Bintang(*)\n\n(1) \"Sri Tribuana\" and \"Sri Tribhuvana\"\u2014Malay Annals, Leyden. But Crawfurd accepts \"Sri Turi Buana,\" and on the authority of Professor Wilson gives \"Illustrious Turi tree of the world\" as the meaning. His first name was \"Sang Surya.\"\n\n(*) L\u00e9lor Daun. \"D\u00e9mang,\" a Chief (Javanese).\u2014 \"Demang L\u00e9bar Daun\"\u2014\"Chiefstain Broad Leaf.\"\n\n(*) Batam or Batang Island lying between Bentan and Bulang? or Bentan?\n\n(*) Kampar, river and country of that name in Sumatra lying between the Siak and Indragiri rivers.\n\n(*) Bentan, the island lying E. by S. of Singapore, on which is a prominent hill visible from Singapore, and alongside of which on the W. side of it, lies Pulau Penyingat, the site of Blau (Rhio).\nLingga (1) (on the South of Malakka), or in Sumatra, are also called Malays, but always with the addition of the name of the country where they come from, as for instance: Malayu-Djohor, Malayu-Patani, &c., &c.\n\nNow, this is that famous far-renowned country considered by many ancients and even by many people now-a-days, to be that very ancient Ophir, the country from where King Solomon got the gold and the other Indian curiosities, mentioned in the H. Scriptures, and consequently called by the ancients \"Regio Aurifera,\" i.e., the gold coast, the gold region.\n\nIt is certain that, leaving Ezion Geber and passing through the Red Sea and so along the shores of Arabia and Persia and from there again along the Coasts of Malabar, Coromandel and Bengal, and so on, skirting along the coast, from one shore to the other and finally along the Kingdoms of Arracan, Pegu, Siam and Tenasserim, till the Malay Coast, this could be done without a compass; but we have amply shown in our first volume and in other places, that it was not this Coast, which was meant by that Ophir, but that it must have been very likely the island of Ceylon.\n\nThe Malays, after having remained at that place for some time, built there their first town, calling it Singapura, and a small sound on the South side of the same town still carries that name.\n\nThe King of Madjapahit (an empire of Java) was in those days one of the most powerful Princes in those quarters. He was not only feared on the island of Java, but he had conquered also many places in Java Minor and in Sumatra and had extended his dominion over several other provinces. (2)\n\nMadjapahit then being one of the first and most celebrated cities, not only of Java, but of the surrounding islands too, the ambition of its Prince induced him to drive this new people out of their country, and consequently to attach a new pearl to his crown. He attacked them several times with large forces and thus forced them to fortify their place more and more.\n\nSri Tjahi Bowana died in 1298, after having ruled them as a brave Prince during 48 years, and was succeeded by Padoeka.\n\n(1) On this island is Dack, the seat of the Johor sovereign after the abandonment of Johor Lama. The occurrence of the names Bintam Lingga and Bintang Lingga together, would suggest perhaps accidental repetitions rather than the inference that Bintam was for Batam, the latter not being well known, while Bentan was in connection with Lingga. This is evidently the case from what appears on p. 65.\n\n(2) And had had communication with China after defeating a Chinese expedition sent against him.\nPikaram Wira as their second Prince. This one did not govern them for such a long space of time; he died after a period of 15 years. He did nothing of importance, only extending the recently built town and fortifying it a little more, so as to be able to withstand better the plots of the mighty Prince of Madjapahit, who did not leave him in peace.\n\nHe died A.D. 1223, and was then succeeded by the third King, Sri Rama Wikaram. This was a young and brave King, who ruled them during 13 years with moderation, and who commenced to be feared all round, but he died very suddenly in 1236, to the great grief of his people, who liked him very much.\n\nHis successor was Sri Maha Raja, who was the fourth King and who also made a very good figure and extended the town greatly. He governed them 12\u00bd years with great care, and was also very much liked by his subjects and feared by his enemies. He died in 1249.\n\nThat same year Sri Iskander Shah was elevated to the crown in his place as the last King of Singapura. He resisted the mighty King of Madjapahit in the first three years of his reign, but was so hard pressed by him at the end of 1252, that he had to abandon Singapura and to migrate higher up to the North side and from thence to the West side of this country, where he laid foundation of a new town in 1253. Including him, five kings had ruled in Singapura during a period of 91 years. He embellished that new place gradually to such an extent that, among the three great and celebrated cities in those quarters of the East, this place was considered afterwards to be the third in rank, or next to Pasi in Sumatra, which stood second next to Madjapahit. He called this new town Malakka, after a certain tree\u2014\"Kajoo Malakka,\" or the Malakka, otherwise called the Mirabolon or the pentagonal tree. While it happened that he commenced to build the town * at the very spot where he had taken some rest under such a tree, whilst waiting there till the dogs dislodged the game, one day that he was hunting in those environs, all which particulars are told at large in the book Hantowah. The former Kings of Madjapahit, not yet satisfied with the conquest of Singapura, crossed to the opposite shore of the island of Sumatra and took there the kingdom of Indragiri. Since then, they have always made one of the Javanese princes, related to them, King of that realm, and we shall find afterwards one of the Kings of\n\n* Mr. Maxwell has drawn attention to the existence of a similar legend amongst the Gujaratis. (Journ. Roy. A.S. Soc., XIII, N.S.)\nMalakka as a King on that throne, invested with that authority by the King of Madjapahit.\n\nIn the meantime this town (Malakka) and this renowned people increased under this prince very much in importance and in power, and it was this King who laid the foundation of a permanent kingdom.\n\nHe lived till 1274 A.D., and died after having governed this people during 25 years, having swayed the sceptre three years in Singapura and 22 years as the first King of Malakka, feared by his neighbours, and beloved by his subjects. Sultan Magat succeeded him that same year as the second Malay King at Malakka.\n\nThis prince died after a short reign of two years, and on his death the Malays had been governed 115 years and 6 months by Heathen Kings.\n\nHe was succeeded in 1276 by Sultan Mohammed Shah, the seventh King of the Malays, and the third of Malakka, who was the first Mohammedan Prince of Malakka; he became famous, while he strongly propagated this new religion and greatly enlarged his empire during the 57 years that he governed this kingdom.\n\nIt seems that it was he who transferred the name of Malajoo to the adjacent islands of Lingga and Bintang or Bintang, South of the Promontory of the Malay Coast, and that he made that name famous among the natives of Djohor, Patani, Keidah (otherwise called Quedah), Peiruh and of other places even on the opposite coast of Sumatra and Gampar (1) and Haru, and that the inhabitants of those quarters, feared him so much, that apparently all their countries were then already subjected to him.\n\nNot satisfied with those conquests, he married in the last years of his reign, the Princess of Arracan, heiress of that King, thus subjecting that kingdom by inheritance, installing the Prince, whom he appointed there and who had been selected among the Malays Mangkubumi, i.e. Chancellor of the Kingdom of Malakka.\n\nHe died A.D. 1333, after having reached a very advanced age, leaving to his son Sultan Anoo Shahid (the eighth King of the Malays, the fourth of Malakka, and the second Mohammedan King) a peaceable kingdom. But this Prince did not possess it a very long time, for he was stabbed by the King of Arracan in 1334, after a reign of but one year and five months, leaving the kingdom in the same condition as his father had left it to him.\n\nHe was succeeded that same year by Sultan Modafar Shah (as\n\n(1) Kampar, see note (1) page 64.\nthe ninth King of the Malays, the fifth of Malakka, and the third Mohammedan King). This King governed his people with great sagacity and very carefully.\n\nHe shewed his sagacity in leaving to his people a book full of sublime rules and maxims, called \"The Statutes of Malakka,\" and he has given also many proofs of his valour during his reign of 40 years.\n\nA very mighty Prince, called Boobatynja governed in 1340 the Kingdom of Siam (then called Sjakarnan or Sornan).\n\nThis King who had overpowered the countries all round his empire, having also received reports of the celebrated commercial town of Malakka, was jealous of its rise, challenged it to surrender, and when King Modafar would not submit to him, he ordered his General Awi Isjakar to attack it.\n\nA fierce battle ensued between these two Princes, or rather between their Generals, but Siri Naha Diraja, the General of Malakka, behaved so valiantly, that he forced the Siamese to retreat with great loss and shame. That King of Siam died soon afterwards, and was succeeded by one Chupandan, who did not leave the matter, but, again attacking the King of Malakka, besieged the town for the second time; but he was as unfortunate as his predecessor, and was also defeated by the same General of Malakka, who gave him such a severe blow in driving him away from the town, that he too died of chagrin a short time afterwards.\n\nIt was at this time that the town of Malakka was considered the third in rank with Madjapahit and Pasi, among the renowned cities in those quarters of the East.\n\nThis Prince governed this kingdom with much glory for some years more, and died in 1374.\n\nHe left his son as his successor, who was first commonly called Sultan Abdul, but called afterwards (when he became King) Sultan Mansor Shah. He was the tenth King of the Malays, the sixth of Malakka, and the fourth Mohammedan King. Many important things happened in these quarters during his reign, and none of his predecessors governed so long as he did, viz., 73 years.\n\nThe Kingdom of Indragiri on the East coast of Sumatra was still under the supremacy of Madjapahit in the beginning of the reign of this King, but when Mansor Shah had married Radin Gala Isjindha Kihana, the daughter of the King of Madjapahit and a Princess of great celebrity, that King bestowed the Kingdom of Indragiri upon his son-in-law, and in this manner Indragiri came under the rule of the Kings of Malakka, who governed it till we came here.\n\nThe King of Madjapahit was at that time (1390), so powerful\nthat he rather ought to have been styled an Emperor than a King, while there were so many Kings submitted to his supremacy, that, when they appeared in his council, he had to show to every one of them their seat according to their rank. He gave the first seat, the place of honour next to him, to the King of Daha; the second seat to the King of Tanjong Pura (Java), who was also married to one of his daughters, Nasa Kusama or Nyai Kanuma and who has succeeded him as King of Madjapahit; and the third seat was the place of the King of Malakka, his other son-in-law.\n\nKing Mansor Shah made also an alliance with the Emperor of China, and married his daughter. After this union he declared war with the King of Pahang and conquered his kingdom.\n\nAt that time Malakka was the first, Pasi the second, and Haru the third city in those quarters of the East: these places were famous, excelling in power and importance. Afterwards he declared also war with the King of Pasi, one Sainalandin,* and defeated him too.\n\nA short time afterwards, about 1420, Krain Samarlooka, King of Macassar, sent a fleet of 200 sail with a strong army to Malakka, to wage war against that place, but the Laksarana or the Admiral of King Mansor Shah attacked the enemy so valiantly, that he compelled him to retreat, and he retired to Pasi, which place he then besieged, ruining the country all round it.\n\nThe said Sainalandin, King of Pasi, afterwards had differences with his two younger brothers, who drove him from his kingdom, compelling him to take refuge with this King of Malakka (Mansor Shah), who took him under his protection.\n\nHe besieged Pasi for the sake of this Prince, and reconquered for him his kingdom and its chief town; but afterwards he (Sainalandin) would not submit to Mansor Shah.\n\nHis reign thus passed in constant wars and military troubles. He died in 1447, leaving his son, Sultan Aleddin as his successor.\n\nHe was the eleventh King of the Malays, the seventh of Malakka and the fifth Mohammedan King.\n\nHis reign lasted 30 years, but it does not appear to me, that he performed anything memorable. It moreover seems to me that, under his rule, Malakka must have submitted for a short time to the dominion of the King of Siam.\n\nHe died in 1477 and was then succeeded by Sultan Mahmud Shah, who was the twelfth King of the Malays, the eighth and also\n\n* Zeinaddin, or Zeinalabedin.\nthe last King of Malakka, and the sixth Mohammedan King.\n\nHe governed this people during 36 years, of which 29 years in Malakka and afterwards 7 years more in Johor. It was under his reign that the Malays threw off the Siamese yoke, and such in 1509; but we will see that at large in what follows.\n\nIt was also during the reign of this King, that the Portuguese arrived for the first time at Malakka, and conquered the country. For the sake of evidence and to clear up the matter, we will mention all those great events from the beginning and treat in due order that part of the history of Malakka and of its Kings till the time, when we arrived in these regions.\n\nARRIVAL OF THE PORTUGUESE AT MALAKKA.\n\nThe Malay historian is not quite correct, when he states that the Portuguese arrived for the first time in these quarters, more especially in Malakka, in the beginning of the 30th year of Sultan Mahmud Shah's reign, for, adding 29 years to the date that he ascended the throne, i.e., 1477, the first arrival of the Portuguese should have happened in A.D. 1506, and it is fully evident from what follows, that they first came here not earlier than two or three years after that date and that they did not conquer Malakka earlier than five years after that date, viz., A.D. 1511. This Prince's reign was consequently a longer one in Malakka and not such a long one in Johor.\n\nKing Emanuel of Portugal ordered in 1508 Jacob Sequeira, (1) one of his Admirals (according to Maffei it was the Admiral Didacus Lopes), to go with 4 vessels of his fleet of 16 sail to Malakka to make a treaty of friendship with the King of that country, then Sultan Mahmud Shah.\n\nArrived at Cochin, he first went in 1509 to Sumatra, touched at Aceh, and finally arrived thence at Malakka.\n\nHe met King Mahmud at that place, who had then just revolted from the King of Siam, under whose dominion the Malays had been for a short time. Sequeira, as soon as he had dropped anchor, forwarded one Hieronymus Teixeira (1) with a present and with a letter written in Arabic from King Emanuel, requesting the said King of Malakka to allow him (Sequeira) to carry on trade in amity, which the King granted him at once.\n\nNo sooner had Sequeira made a treaty of friendship and of\n\n(1) This name is still met with here.\ncommerce, than the Moors and Arabs pointed out to the King that the Portuguese did not come here to trade, but that it was their intention to drive the Prince out of his kingdom. They spoke so in fear that, when the Portuguese were once allowed to trade here, their own trade by means of caravans from Cairo and Alexandria in Egypt and to Europe would be totally ruined.\n\nThey aspersed the Portuguese character to the utmost, and told the King that they had acted in that very manner at Cochin, Cannanore, Ormus and other places, that they had seized upon the said countries and had built fortresses in all these places to vindicate their rights.\n\nThe consequence of these insinuations was that the Moors at once made up his mind to violate his word and to break the treaty already made with Sequeira, and he intended to invite him with his principal officers to a dinner and to kill them all at that party.\n\nThe Moors thought this plot to be carried out as easily as it had been easy to their cunningness to persuade the King to their purposes, but we will see that they did not succeed so readily as they had imagined.\n\nTrue, Sequeira had already accepted the invitation, but, in the meantime, having been informed of the said plot, he pretended to be unwell and betrayed nothing.\n\nThe King had also allowed Sequeira to have a building on shore, in which house Rodrigo Arango (1) had already established himself as the Supercargo for the trade of the Portuguese.\n\nThe Chinamen living here and a Persian woman had informed Sequeira in time, by means of a tailor, of the intended treachery, but at first neither he nor his companions would believe that it was true, and they went on courting the girls in the town behaving unhastily.\n\nOne Nakhoda Benga and one Istee Mutis, (2) a Javanese Raja (I really don't know how to spell these names), the wealthiest inhabitants of this place next to the King, meantime did their best to kindle this fire and to confirm the King of Malakka more and more in his hatred to the Portuguese. They made splendid presents to the King and to his uncle, thus trying to obtain their villainous object; but the Admiral of the King of Malakka, an honest man, fully disapproved this shameful treason, and maintained that the King was obliged to keep the treaty at least as long as these new customers had not given him a reason to do something\n\n(1) According to the Commentaries of Albuquerque, \"Ruy de Araujo.\"\n(2) Utimuti, a Javanese title.\nof that kind with some appearance of justice: but all his persuasion, though well-founded, had no effect.\n\nWhen Mahmut heard that his first plot had failed and that the principal reason that Sequeira had not come was, that the promised spices had not been forwarded to him, he sent him word that he would despatch at once the crafts with the goods. Sequeira seemed to be pretty well pleased with this message, but he for his part stationed at the same time some of his boats on four different places so as to be prepared for all eventualities.\n\nThe King sent some embarkations with soldiers besides, who were hidden under the victuals and provisions. He ordered moreover some of his people to conceal their arms under their garments and to try to get access on board of the vessels as dealers in estates, and to take hold of the opportunity as soon as they perceived a column of smoke going up in the town.\n\nPetrus Maffei tells us, that Isute Mutis had ordered his cousin, one Patilgoos, to kill Sequeira, while Sequeira had put his trust entirely in that man and admitted him freely into his presence.\n\nWhen everything had been properly arranged, the crafts paddled to the vessels; they created suspicion, however, by ascending the vessels with too large a number at once and Gracia de Sousa noticing this stopped them and sent Ferdinand Magellan to Sequeira, to warn him that there was something suspicious in the wind.\n\nIsute Mutis and his men, eight of which already surrounded Sequeira, who was playing at chess, stood anxiously waiting for the signal on shore, viz., the column of smoke. Sequeira, though warned by Magellan, did not care at all about it, he only ordered a Mate to ascend the mast to see if the boats, which had their freight, were on the way back already, and continued his game as passionately as ever. Still the signal was not given, and when the Mate, who was in the mast, saw that a Malay drew his Kris and that another made a sign to show the first one, that it was not the right moment yet, he warned Sequeira at the top of his voice, that those Malays were merely waiting for a signal to effectuate their plot.\n\nSequeira called out for his arms just in time and drove the enemies overboard, who, astonished and wild that their attempt again had failed, jumped in their boats and hurried away from the vessels.\n\nThe signal on shore was given just after they had left the vessels, and the consequence was that those who had still stopped\nstraggling in the town, were murdered unmercifully. Twenty of them fled to the house of Rodrigo Arango (1) and Francisco Serano, and having got a boat in time escaped the massacre.\n\nWhilst Sequeira and his officers were still deliberating with each other about this wicked deed, the King and the Bandahara (Chancellor of the Exchequer) sent an Ambassador to the vessels to apologize for what had happened, offering to punish all the culprits and to deliver unhurt all the Portuguese who were still in Arango's house. The very first thing that Sequeira did, was to claim, that those Portuguese should be surrendered at once, but seeing that the King was continually using subterfuges and that his ships got gradually surrounded by a great many native crafts, blocking him up imperceptibly, he thought it more advisable not to stop any longer, but to weigh anchor, not only to avoid a flagrant breach of peace, but also not to miss his return to India through the Ganges, by the passing of the monsoon. But when he received the intelligence, that d'Almeida (together with whom he had been dispatched) had returned home, he too went back to Portugal. The famous Alfonso Albukirke, who had been appointed Vice-Roy in 1509, had resolved in the meantime to conquer Aden, in compliance with the orders of his Sovereign; he consequently first sailed with 23 vessels, manned with 800 Portuguese and 600 Natives of Malabar to Ormus, intending to take the usual way, but, prevented by contrary winds, he had to put it off an to take another resolution. He then conquered Goa and made peace at Ormus.\n\nJacob Mendes Vasconsel, backed by several other ship-masters, wanted then to go to Malakka against the advice of Albukirke and actually started to realize that plan; but Albukirke had him brought back by main force, imprisoned him and dismissed several of his advisers.\n\nHe made at the same time a treaty with the King of Pacem (Pasi) and insisted upon the extradition of Nakhoda Begra; but this one having escaped before he could be surrendered, the Portuguese at once pursued him and succeeded in overtaking his ship, he was killed after having defended himself very bravely.\n\nThe following curious fact occurred at his death, viz., that no blood was to be seen first, though he had been stabbed through; but it was discovered then, that he wore a blood-stanching stone\n\n(1) See note (1) p. 71.\nThe following is an extract from a larger text:\n\n\"The King was informed by his councilors that the enemy had been removed from their territory. The King then ordered his army to advance towards the enemy's position. The army moved forward in a disciplined manner, with the King at its head. The enemy army, seeing the approaching force, retreated in disarray. The King's army pursued them, capturing many prisoners and taking much plunder. The King returned to his capital city, celebrated his victory, and rewarded his soldiers with honors and riches.\"\n\nThis extract highlights the strategic and tactical aspects of warfare, emphasizing the importance of leadership, discipline, and the use of military strategy to achieve victory. It also underscores the consequences of retreat and the potential gains from pursuing the enemy.\nthe King tried again to deceive him, he ordered to set fire to his palace. Then the King begged to make peace and accepted the terms made by Albukirr, who demanded the delivery of all the Portuguese, the restitution of the stolen goods, and the indemnification of the expenses for two fleets, which had been despatched this way; but the King's son (whom Maffei has named Almodis) and the King of Pahang declining to accept the said terms, Albukirr ordered his troops to attack and to plunder the town, and to spare only the properties of one Ninachetu and of Isutinutis, (who had already made peace with him before and had submitted to him) and of all the Javanese who stood under his orders and of a few other individuals, who were his allies in town. The King having been wounded personally dismounted his elephant and fled, and so did the King of Pahang too, and they never returned again.\n\nA few days afterwards he and his General Antonio d'Abreo (1) attacked the town for a second time; a fierce battle was fought, but d'Abreo conquering a certain bridge put the Malays to flight and Albukirr made his entry in the royal palace where he found that the King and his household had already fled.\n\nAlmodis having collected the fugitives, was defeated for a second time and compelled to flee to the island of Bintam (situated opposite to Singapore), where he fortified himself in spite of its Prince.\n\nThe Portuguese, once masters of the town, plundered it thoroughly, capturing among other things the 9,000 brass guns. The booty seized at Malakka was so rich, that one fifth of it, i.e., the part reserved for the King (of Portugal), amounted to 200,000 ducats.\n\nAlbukirr appointed Raja Isutinutis, head of the Moors, and Ninachetu, head of the other native inhabitants; he fortified the town, opened the place for the trade, and built of the tombs of the Kings the first Christian Church, devoted to the Annunciation.\n\nHe sent the news of this conquest to the King of Siam, who was very much pleased, that his disloyal vassal had been punished so severely, he congratulated Albukirr on his success and begged him to make an offensive and defensive alliance. The Laxmana (or Admiral of Malakka) came to beg him also to consider him a friend, assuring him, that he had tried to dissuade the King from making war, and Albukirr pardoned him also.\n\nAnd behold now this proud Malakka, the glory and the success of the Malays!\n\n(1) Commentaries\u2014Albuquerque, \"Dabren.\"\nThe fugitive King Mahmud did not die of grief (1) (as it is asserted by the Portuguese), but he had fled in 1511, to the North-East side of the Southern Promontory of the country, after having ruled Malakka for 34 years; with him a period of 252 years was completed that this country had been under the sway of Malay Kings. He commenced to build a new town at that place (the third one built by Malay Kings in those quarters), enlarged it and finally finished it, and gave it the name of Johor, after the Arabic word \"Johor\" perhaps, which means \"a pearl\" also \"the fine human shape.\"\n\nHe founded a new empire there, the Kings of which from that date were no longer styled Malay Princes or Kings of Malakka, but Kings of Johor. He reigned two years at that place, died in 1513, and was succeeded by his son, who had not the name of Allodin (according to the Portuguese historians), but who has been mentioned by the Malays as Sultan Ahmed Shah, in their genealogical register of the Kings of Malakka and Johor. He was the thirteenth King of the Malays, the first of Johor, and the seventh Mohammedian King.\n\n[To be continued.]\n\n(1) The Commentaries say he died at Pahang, a few days after his arrival there.\nTHE LAW AND CUSTOMS OF THE MALAYS WITH REFERENCE TO THE TENURE OF LAND.\n\nIntroductory.\n\nHere are, probably, few subjects connected with the Government of a Malay population which are so little understood by Englishmen in the Colony as the principles which account for the point of view from which these people treat the possession of, and rights in, land. Successive generations of public servants in the Straits Settlements have been haunted by a bug-bear known as \"the Malacca Land Question,\" which still makes periodical appearances, and is very far from having been set finally at rest: it is nearly sixty years old and has derived from the joint forces of ignorance and neglect an extraordinary vitality. From time to time a great deal of well-meant labour has been employed in trying to bring Asiatic customs and English law into harmony without the aid of legislation, and it need hardly be said that the task is an endless one. Two systems of tenure have been in operation in Malacca during the greater part of this century, and the present generation of officials have inherited a legacy of confusion in which time develops fresh combinations continually.\n\nIn all the provinces of British India, British Administrators have taken the native revenue system as the ground-work on which to build up a detailed and consistent structure of land-revenue administration. Native tenure has been fully recognised; native law has been studied; the technical terms used in the vernacular to express particular documents, tenures and native officials have been preserved and are employed in all the Courts; nothing so fatal to the prosperity of the country and\nso unsuited to the native mind as the introduction of English real-property law has been dreamt of. Why was the policy of Indian Administrators as regards Malacca directly contrary to that pursued in British India? Principally, I think, because it was not soon enough discovered that the conditions of Malacca\u2014an ancient Malay kingdom and then successively a Portuguese and Dutch Colony\u2014differed fundamentally from those of the modern Settlements of Penang and Singapore, which had no population prior to their acquisition by the East India Company, and to which, therefore, any law of land tenure might be applied without the fear of disturbing existing rights, interests, customs, prejudices or superstitions. Malacca has never been the seat of Government during its occupation by the British, and the land laws and regulations formulated from time to time by officials, more conversant with the English practice introduced into Penang and Singapore, than with native law and custom, have never really fulfilled their purpose.\n\nWithin the last nine years, certain Malay States on the West Coast of the Peninsula have fallen under the direction of British Officers subordinate to the Government of the Straits Settlements, and the latter are, therefore, to some extent, in a position similar to that of the Malacca officials earlier in the century. Unless future generations of public servants are to be confronted by a Perak, a Selangor, or a Sungai Ujong \"Land Question,\" it is difficult to exaggerate the importance of studying very closely, and understanding very clearly, the nature of native rights in land. There is even a danger of imbibing and conveying erroneous ideas on the subject by the use of English technical terms.\n\nThe first proclamation about land issued in Perak under the advice of a British Resident contained such terms as \"fee simple,\" and in Larut, as early as 1876, land was being transferred and mortgaged with all English legal technicalities by the aid of two or three ignorant scribes who brought printed forms from the nearest British Settlement\u2014Penang! It is perhaps doubtful if, to this day, the Malay law of land tenure and Malay thought and feeling regarding land are properly understood by Europeans in Native States, and, if not, there may be reason to fear difficulties in years to come.\nBesides persons in the service of the Native Governments, who are brought, by their duties, into connection with native land-holders, there is an independent class of British settlers\u2014planters, miners and others\u2014to whom it may be important to know what rights in contiguous land their native neighbours may have, and how far they are at liberty to alienate them.\n\nIt has occurred to me, therefore, that it may be useful to summarise, as far as I have been able to ascertain it, the law relating to immoveable property in an independent Malay State, and to publish translated extracts from Malay Codes of laws, as well as the judgments of English Judges who have had to deal with the subject. I shall be amply repaid for the trouble which I have taken to examine the available information, and to arrange it in an intelligible form, if increased recognition and respect for the rights of native land-holders should be obtained thereby.\n\nChapter I.\n\nPROPRIETARY RIGHT.\n\nThe customary law of the Malays with reference to the occupation and proprietorship of land differs little from that of other Indo-Chinese nations\u2014the Burmese, Siamese and others. The natural condition of land in Malay countries, from Sumatra to Borneo, is characterised by dense forest, which demands no small labour and perseverance before a clearing is effected and cultivation commenced. Land is abundant, but the population is sparse; there is no restriction upon the selection and appropriation of forest land, and a proprietary right is created by the clearing of the land followed by continuous occu-\nForest land and land which, though once cleared, has been abandoned and bears no trace of appropriation (such as fruit-trees still existing) are said technically to be tanah mati, or \"dead land.\" He who, by clearing or cultivation, or by building a house, causes that to live which was dead (meng-hidop-kan bumi), acquires a proprietary right in the land, which now becomes tanah hidop (\"live land\") in contradistinction to tanah mati. His right to the land is absolute as long as occupation continues, or as long as the land bears signs of appropriation.\n\nThis qualification of the right of the proprietor is the key to several important distinctions which help towards the classification of the subject. Malays practice two kinds of cultivation\u2014either permanent cultivation (wet rice-fields and plantations of fruit-trees) in the plains; or shifting cultivation (dry rice-lands and vegetable gardens) on the hills. In cultivation of the latter kind, the element of continuous occupation, and, therefore, a lasting proprietary right, is wanting. Again, between wet rice-fields and fruit-plantations there is a wide difference in respect to the permanence of evidence of appropriation; the former, if left uncultivated for a few years, are soon covered with brushwood and rank vegetation, in which are harboured vermin of all sorts, to the injury of the crops of contiguous owners, and show no signs, except the absence of heavy forest, of ever having been cultivated; the latter, on the other hand, even if abandoned, do not disappear for many years, not, in fact, until the insidious growth of jungle chokes and kills the fruit-trees. Malay custom has, therefore, fixed three years as the term within which wet rice-fields, if left uncultivated, shall remain subject to the proprietary right of the owner. If wet rice-land remains uncultivated for more than that period, it is open to the Raja, Chief or headman, within whose district it is situated, to put in another\n\n* \"In practice there may be said to be but one original foundation for land tenures in Burma, viz., that the cultivated-land clearer acquires an absolute dominion over the soil, subject only to contribution for the service of the State. He can alienate it by gift or sale, and in default of his doing so, it descends to his heirs in the usual order of succession. The title to land, therefore, is essentially allodial.\" British Burma Gazetteer, I, 438.\ncultivator. Abandoned fruit-plantations, on the other hand, may be successfully claimed and resumed by the proprietor, or by any one claiming under him by descent or transfer, as long as any of the trees survive, and the proprietary right is not extinguished until all evidence of proprietorship is gone.*\n\nA general view of the tenure of land in a Malay State has been given by Colonel Low; \u2020 the State selected as a type of the rest being Kedah, as it existed before the Siamese conquest:\n\n\"The sovereign was lord of the soil, which the orang bindang, or ryots, cultivated under regular tenures. The chief one was termed surat putus, under which the occupier paid at the outset the price of one mas, or rupee, for every ortong of land. He received this deed from the Raja, and it was stamped with the chops of the latter and his ministers. It was in perpetuity, and could not be alienated, but was subject to resumption by the Government if the possessor allowed the land to go to waste within a given period\u2014sometimes thirty years. Instead of a regular quit-rent, each ryot capable of labour was subjected to a capitation-tax of 16 gantungs of paddy and one of cleaned rice, which would now be equivalent to nearly a dollar. This was occasionally commuted into a copper payment.\" But Colonel Low fails to remark, what I believe to be the case, that only a small portion of the land of the State,\n\n* This is what I have myself observed in Perak, and have heard declared by natives to be the custom of the country. It agrees with what Marsden says of the Malays of Sumatra:\n\n\"Whilst any of those (fruit-trees) subsist, the descendants of the planter may claim the ground, though it has been for years abandoned. If they are cut down, he may recover damages; but if they have disappeared in the course of nature, the land reverts to the public.\"\n\n\u2020 Dissertation on Penang and Province Wellesley, p. 6. The practice of using a written document has perhaps been borrowed by the Kedah Malays from the Siamese: \"A Chau Nao, or cultivator, who is desirous of clearing ground, applies to the headman of the village. The latter shows his written application to the proper officer, who directs him to inspect the land and measure it. The applicant, having obtained it, receives a written title; but although he is not in it vested absolutely with a right in perpetuity, still the land forms thereafter a part of his real property, is alienable by deed of sale, or by gift, and descends to his heirs at law. From this it is clear that the King can take advantage of so defective a title. Prescription is the owner's best safeguard.\"\u2014Colonel Low, Journ. Ind. Arch., I, 337.\nand that the best padi land probably, is held direct from the Raja by surut putus. The restriction on alienation is, therefore, limited in operation, and the doctrine of proprietary right created by clearing and occupying is general.\n\nThe rules as to proprietary right may be stated as follows:\n\n1. There can be no proprietary right in tanah mati.\n\n2. Tanah hidop is of three kinds:\n   (a) Land planted with fruit-trees (tanah kampong).\n   (b) Wet rice-land (tanah bendang, or, sarah).\n   (c) Hill-land taken up for shifting crops (tanah huma, or, ladang).\n\n3. The proprietary right in kampong land endures during occupation and afterwards as long as any fruit-trees remain as evidence that the land is tanah hidop.\n\n4. The proprietary right in tanah bendang, or sarah, lasts as long as the land is occupied, and for three years afterwards.\n\n5. The proprietary right in tanah huma, or ladang, lasts as long as the land is occupied, which is usually a single season.\n\nThe rights of tenure in a primitive Malay settlement are thus exceedingly simple, if each proprietor is viewed as the owner of the piece of land which he has won for himself from the forest. The kampong, or village, is made up of independent holdings, and there is no such thing as a joint ownership, by the inhabitants of a village or tract, of cultivated lands, which is common in India. In long-established and populous settlements, the cultivated lands of which have been transmitted by descent for generations, there has, of course, been time for the operation of all sorts of influences\u2014the result of a comparatively civilised state of society\u2014which have contributed to introduce fresh modifications into the simple rules just enunciated. Thus, it will become necessary to consider, further on, the right of the Raja to a share of the produce, the liability of the proprietor for personal service, the right of the proprietor to sell and mortgage, the law of inheritance, &c.\nMALAY LAND TENURE.\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nHUMA OR LADANG CULTIVATION.\n\nThe most primitive form of cultivation known to the Malays, and one that is practised by numerous Indo-Chinese tribes, is the hill-farm system.*\n\nThe Malay peasant who does not possess a sawah, or wet padi field, or who, possessing one, is unable, from want of buffaloes or some other cause, to work it, selects a piece of forest land on the side of a hill and proceeds to clear it by first cutting down (tubas) the under-wood and then felling (tibang) the forest trees.\n\nWork is commenced about March or April, and when the fallen timber is dry it is set on fire; if this is skilfully done and advantage taken of wind, the whole is rapidly consumed, leaving a clear surface for agricultural operations. Charred stumps stick up in all directions on the clearing, and some of the lighter timber is turned to account in making a rough fence round the cultivated patch. Hill-padi (padi huma) is then sown by dropping a few seeds into holes made at short intervals with a pointed stick. Many Malays prefer the ladang system, as it is called, to the wet cultivation on the plains, for one reason, namely, the variety of different edible vegetables which a ladang will produce. Besides the hill-padi, he can grow on his farm bananas, Indian-corn, pumpkins and gourds, sugar-cane, chillies, &c., &c. Sometimes the same piece of land is cultivated in this manner two years running, but usually new land is taken up every year.\n\nThe Sakai and other aboriginal tribes who inhabit the interior of the Peninsula, also practise this system of hill-cultivation, and their clearings may be seen on the sides of the more distant mountains far removed from the districts inhabited by the Malays. Logan observed this among the wild tribes in the South of the Peninsula, and has described their mode of clearing and planting their ladang. \u2020\n\n* \"The custom of 'Chena' farms is of extreme antiquity in Ceylon.\"\n\n\u2020 It is alluded to in the Mahawanso, B.C. 161, ch. xxiii, p. 140.\"\u2014Tennent's Ceylon, II, 463.\n\n\u2020 Journ. Ind. Arch., I, 455.\nThis is, no doubt, the national Malay mode of agriculture, and characteristically enough it is introduced into the legend which tells of the establishment of a royal line of Indian origin in Malay countries. The two peasant women whom the first Indian king meets when he descends upon the sacred mountain at Palembang, are described as engaged in cultivating a hill-garden (ker-ladang) where they plant hill-padi.* The successive processes of clearing, burning and planting appear to be carried out in Sumatra in precisely the same way as on the Peninsula.\u2020\n\nTennent's description of \"Chena\" cultivation in Ceylon is worth transcribing in full. It will be seen that he regards the disadvantages of the system as outweighed by its advantages:\u2014\n\n\"The process of Chena cultivation in this province is unique and simple. The forest being felled, burned, cleared, and fenced, each individual's share is distinguished by marks, huts are erected for the several families, and in September the land is planted with Indian corn and pumpkins; and melon seeds are sown, and cassava plants put down round the enclosure. In December, the Indian corn is pulled in the cob and carried to market; and the ground is re-sown with millet and other kinds of grain, chillies, sweet potatoes, sugar-cane, hemp, yams, and other vegetables, over which an unweeded watch is kept up till March and April, when all is gathered and carried off. But as the cotton plants, which are put in at the same time with the small grain and other articles that form the second crop after the Indian corn has been pulled, require two years to come to maturity, one party is left behind to tend and gather, whilst their companions move forward into the forest to commence the process of felling the trees, and forming another Chena farm.\n\n\"The Chena cultivation lasts but for two years in any one locality. It is undertaken by a company of speculators under a license from the government agent of the district, and a single crop of grain having been secured and sufficient time allowed for the ripening and collection of the cotton,\n\n* Journ. Royal As. Soc'y. vol. XIII, N.S., p. 401.\n\u2020 Maraden, Hist. of Sumatra, 62.\nthe whole enclosure is abandoned and permitted to return\nto jungle, the adventurers moving onward to clear a fresh\nChena elsewhere, and take a crop off some other enclosure,\nto be in turn abandoned like the first; as in this province\nno Chena is considered worth the labour of a second culti-\nvation until after an interval of fifteen years from the\nfirst harvest.\n\nDuring the period of cultivation great numbers resort to\nthe forests; comfortable huts are built; poultry is reared;\nthread spun, and chatties and other earthenware vessels are\nmade and fired; and by this primitive mode of life, which\nhas attractions much superior to the monotonous cultivation\nof a coco-nut garden or an ancestral paddy farm, numbers\nof the population find the means of support. It likewise\nsuits the fancy of those who feel repugnant to labour for\nhire, but begrudge no toil upon a spot of earth which they\ncan call their own; where they can choose their own hours\nfor work and follow their own impulses to rest and idleness.\n\nIt is impossible to deny that this system tends to encourage\nthe natives in their predilection for a restless and unsettled\nlife, and that it therefore militates against their attaching\nthemselves to fixed pursuits, through which the interests of\nthe whole community would eventually be advanced. It\nlikewise leads to the destruction of large tracts of forest land,\nwhich, after conversion to Chena, are unprofitable for a long\nseries of years; but, on the other hand, it is equally evident\nthat the custom tends materially to augment the food of the\ndistrict (especially during periods of drought); to sustain\nthe wages of labour, and to prevent an undue increase in the\nmarket-value of the first necessaries of life. Regarding it in\nthis light, and looking to the prodigious extent of forest land\nin the island, of which the Chena cultivation affects only a\nminute and unsaleable portion, it is a prevalent and plausible\nsupposition, in which, however, I am little disposed to\nacquiesce, that the advantages are sufficient to counterbalance\nthe disadvantages of the system.\"\n\nForbes,* who also gives a full description of this system of\n\n* British Burma, 284. \"I am not aware that the ludang mode of cultivation offers any other advantage to the Malays than that it is compatible with the enjoyment of a wandering life.\"\u2014NEWBOLD, Straits of Malacca, i, 263.\nagriculture as it prevails among the Karens of Burma, regards as \"their great peculiarity,\" which they possess in common \"with all the hill-races, not only of Burma and Assam, but of the whole of India, their unsettled and ever-changing mode of life, which entitles them to the designation of 'nomadic cultivators.' To raise their scanty crops, the virgin forests on the steep slopes of the hills must be cleared and burned; but the excessive rainfall washes the friable soil off the surface, so that only one crop can be raised on the same spot until it has again become overgrown with jungle and a fresh deposit of earth has formed.\"\n\nThe same practice exists among the more remote and uncivilised tribes in Siam. The husbandry of the people of Laos and of the Karieng tribe is thus described by Pallegoix:\u2014\"Les Lao choisissent un endroit fertile dans la for\u00eat voisine, en abattent tous les arbres, et y mettent le feu, ce qui donne \u00e0 la terre une f\u00e9condit\u00e9 surprenante.\" *.............\" Les Karieng, de m\u00eame que les Lao, ont coutume de couper et de br\u00fbler chaque ann\u00e9e une certaine \u00e9tendue de la for\u00eat pour planter leur riz, changeant ainsi de place tous les ans, ce qui les oblige \u00e0 construire souvent de nouvelles cabanes.\" \u2020\n\nCambodia furnishes another example:\u2014\n\n\"La culture par le d\u00e9frichement et l'incendie des for\u00eats adopt\u00e9e par les habitants sauvages de l'int\u00e9rieur est encore bien plus barbare et plus regrettable.

The Dyaks of Borneo\nrepeat year by year the toilsome operation of clearing forest\nland for their temporary farms. \"They do not suppose that\nthe soil is in any way incapable of bearing further culture, but\ngive always as a reason for deserting their farms, that the\nweeds and grass which immediately spring up after the padi\nhas been gathered are less easily eradicated than ground occu-\npied by old jungle is prepared. They never return to the\nsame spot until after a period of seven years has elapsed,\nwhich they say was the custom of their ancestors.\"\u00a7\n\nAmong the hill-tribes of India, the same primitive mode of\ncultivation which Himalaic swarms have carried eastward to\nBurma, Siam, the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo,\nmay be viewed in the very districts, perhaps, in which it origi-\nnated. The Kukis (north-east of Chittagong) cut down the\njungle on the declivity of some hill in the month of March,\nand allow it to remain there until sufficiently decayed to burn\nfreely, when they set it on fire, and thus at once perform the\ndouble purpose of clearing away the rubbish and of manuring\nthe ground with its ashes. The women now dig small holes\nat certain distances in the spot so cleared and into each hole\nthey throw a handful of different seeds they intend to rear.||\n\nThe Abors observe the same method of cultivation, but take\nthree successive crops off it before abandoning it.\u00b6\n\nIn India and Burma the control of this practice has neces-\nsarily engaged the attention of district officers, and in some\ndistricts fiscal regulations have recognised this system of shift-\n\n* Le Royaume du Cambodge\u2014Moura, I, 25, 26.\n\u2020 Journ.

In the Straits Settlements, on the other hand, where the necessity of making every cultivator take out a lease seems to have been the whole and sole guiding principle of the Land Office, the ladang or huma system has never been recognised and regulated. It is still practised, nevertheless, in parts of Malacca at a loss of revenue to the Colony. In Native States on the Peninsula it is, of course, common.\n\nThe following remarks on the temporary cultivation of hill-farms by certain tribes in India and Burma are extracted from Baden-Powell's Manual of the Land Revenue Systems and Land Tenures of British India (1882), p. 102:\n\n\"Shifting Cultivation.\n\n\"An account, however elementary, of Indian land tenures, would be incomplete without some notice of a customary holding of jungle land which is widely prevalent in parts of India, but which is of such a nature that it is very doubtful whether the term 'land-tenure' can with propriety be applied to it. I allude to the practice of temporary or shifting cultivation of patches of forest, which has in some districts proved an obstacle, or at least a source of difficulty in the way of making arrangements for the preservation of wooded tracts as forest estates, a work which modern science recognises as essential for almost any country, and especially a great continent like India with its climatic changes and seasons of drought of such frequent recurrence.\"\n\n\"In the jungle-clad hill country on the east and north of Bengal, in the Gh\u00e2ts of the eastern and western coasts of the peninsula, in the inland hill ranges of the Central Provinces and Southern India, there are aboriginal tribes who live by clearing patches of the jungle, and taking a crop or two off the virgin soil, after which the tract is left to grow up again while a new one is attacked.\n\n\"This method of cultivation seems to be instinctive to all tribes inhabiting such districts. It seems to be the natural and obvious method of dealing with a country so situated.\n\n\"The details of the custom are of course various, and the names are legion. The most widespread names, however, are\n\"jum\" in Bengal, *bevar* (often, but incorrectly, dahyd)\n\"in the Central Provinces, *kumri* in South India, and\n*toung-y\u00e1* in Burma.\n\n\"In all cases the essence of the practice consists in selecting\na hill side where the excessive tropical rainfall will drain off\nsufficiently to prevent flooding of the crop and on which there\nis a sufficient depth of soil. A few plots are selected, and all\nthe vegetation carefully cut; the larger trees will usually be\nringed and left to die\u2014standing bare and dried, there will be\nno shade from them hurtful to the ripening crop. The refuse\nis left on the ground to dry. At the proper season, when the\ndry weather is at its height, and before the first rains begin\nand fit the ground for sowing, the whole mass will be set\non fire; the ashes are dug into the ground, and the seed is\nsown,\u2014usually being mixed with the ashes and the whole dug\nin together. The plough is not used. The great labour after\nthat consists in weeding, and it is the only labour after the\nfirst few days of hard cutting, to clear the ground in the first\ninstance, are over. Weeding is, in many places, a sine qua non,\nfor the rich soil would soon send up a crop of jungle growth\nthat would suppress the hill rice or whatever it is that has\nbeen sown.\u2020\n\n\"A second crop may be taken, the following year, possibly a\nthird, but then a new piece is cut, and the process is repeated.\n\n*Nature of Right to which such Practice gives rise.*\n\n\"When the whole of the area in the locality judged suitable\nfor treatment is exhausted, the families or tribes will move off\nto another region, and may, if land is abundant, only come\nback to the same hill sides after twenty or even forty years.\nBut when the families are numerous, the land available be-\n\n*Jum is the general name used in official reports, but in reality this\nname must be entirely local. In fact no one name can be applied. In the\nGaro hills, in Chittagong, in Goalpara, in Santalia, and no doubt in every\nother district where this method of cultivation is practised, there is a differ-\nent local name.\"\n\n\u2020 \"But this is not always the case, where the hill land has long been subject\nto this treatment, or where the soil is peculiar; in the Garo hills, I am told,\nweeding is not required.\"\ncomes limited and then the rotation is shortened to a number\nof years\u2014seven or even less\u2014in which a growth, now reduced\nto bamboos and smaller jungle, can be got up to a sufficient\ndensity and height to give the soil and the ash-manure neces-\nsary. In its ordinary form, this method of cultivation may\ngive rise to some difficult questions. It obviously does not\namount to a permanent, adverse occupation of a definite area\nof land; nor does it exactly fall in with any western legal con-\nception of a right of user. In some cases it may be destructive\nof forest which is of great use and value, in others the forest\nmay be of no use whatever, and this method of cultivation may\nbe natural and necessary. The progress of civilisation and the\nincrease in the population always tend to bring this class of\ncultivation into the former category, and then it is very difficult\nto deal with. It is impossible not to feel that whatever may\nbe the theoretical failure in the growth of a strict right, the\ntribes that have for generations practised this cultivation from\none range of hills to another, have something closely resem-\nbling a right; they have probably been paying a Government\nrevenue or tax\u2014so much per adult male who can wield the\nknife or axe with which the clearing is effected\u2014which\nstrengthens their claim to consideration. In creating forest\nestates for the public benefit, the adjustment of 'toung-yad,'\n'kumri,' or 'jum' claims has now become a matter of\nsettled and well-understood practice. In the Western Ghats it\nis becoming a subject of difficulty,* but the discussion of the\n\n*Already, in the Konkan, whole hill sides have been reduced to sterility,\nwhile the soil washed by the heavy monsoon rains off the bare hill side, has\nsilted up and rendered useless, streams and creeks which were once navigable.\nThe difficulty is that the tribes are always semi-barbarous, and the task is to\ninduce them to overcome their apathy and take to permanent cultivation.\nUnfortunately, sympathetic officials, properly alive to the necessity of kindly\ntreating these tribes, are usually totally blind to the real danger of destroying\nthe Ghat forests, or what is worse, professing to believe it, the belief has no\nreal hold on them. To abolish this destructive cultivation, serious and sus-\ntained effort is necessary; to get the people to settle down, and to procure\nfor them cattle, ploughs, and seed-grain, requires liberal expenditure. It is\ndifficult to find officers who have the time or the zeal necessary for the first,\nand financial difficulties are likely to be in the way of the second. An easier\ncourse is to draw harrowing pictures of the suffering caused to the tribes by\nstopping their ancient cultivation, and to denounce the efforts of the Forest\nAdministration as being harsh and without recognition of the wants of the\nMALAY LAND TENURE.\n\n\"question would be foreign to my present purpose, which is merely to describe what is in fact a form of land occupation or quasi-tenure.\"\n\nChapter III.\n\nTHE RIGHTS OF THE RAJA.\n\nMonarchical government was introduced among the Malay tribes by Hindu rulers from India, and a new element was thus added to the primitive structure of society theretofore existing. The settlement or group of settlements of individual cultivators (each deriving his right to his holding from the fact that he and his family or slaves had reclaimed it from the forest) who lived in tribes under elected Chiefs, or Penghulus, for mutual protection, now became subject to the incidents of Aryan kingly government.\n\nThe rights of the Raja in the early Hindu kingdoms in India were:\n\n1. The right to a share in the grain.\n2. The right to collect taxes.\n3. The right of disposal of waste land.\n\nThe proportion of the padi crop which the Malay Raja or Chief can claim has come to be fixed by custom at one-tenth of the grain, and payment can be enforced by seizure of the crop or land. A new qualification in the proprietary right of the\n\n\"people. It is unfortunate that the very forests at the head-waters of streams with dense growth and steep slopes, which forest economy most imperatively calls on us to preserve, are the very tracts in which this temporary cultivation is most insisted on.\"\nland-holder has thus grown up in some districts. It was explained just now that his right, which was based upon original occupation, is absolute as long as that occupation continues; to this must now be added, \"and as long as a proportion of the grain is paid to the Raja or Chiefs.\"\n\nThe rate of one-tenth of the produce thus leviable by Malay custom is, it should be observed, the same as the rate still collected under a law based upon native custom, in Ceylon. So, in China, \"the land is held as a freehold as long as the sovereign receives his rent, which is estimated at about one-tenth of the produce,\" and the proprietors record their names \"in the District Magistrate's Office as responsible for the tax, feeling themselves secure in the possession while that is paid.\"*\n\nIn Cambodia, too, the share of the sovereign is one-tenth of gross produce.\u2020 Low, speaking of Siamese rule in Kedah, says: \"The Siamese, following the code of Menu, affect to exact only one-tenth of the gross produce value, but the tax is more than doubled in practice.\"\u2021\n\nThe right of the Raja to dispose of waste land cannot have been seriously exerted in Malay States in respect of forest land. The old Malay custom which permitted the free selection and appropriation of forest land for the purposes of cultivation was not interfered with, the adoption of any other course being almost impossible in countries the greater part of which was under forest. As regards abandoned land, or land to which there was no heir, it was, no doubt, different, and the rights of the Raja were often duly enforced. It is not difficult to see how the rights of the Raja to demand a proportion of the produce, on pain of forfeiture of the holding, and to dispose of waste land, tended by degrees to create the doctrine that the right to the soil was in the Raja. Such a doctrine did in fact grow up, and being, to all appearance, consistent with the rights exercised by the Raja, and not incompatible with the proprietary rights claimed by the Malay land-holder, it has received complete acceptance in Malay States. It was\n\n* The Middle Kingdom\u2014WILLIAMS, II. 100.\n\u2020 Le Royaume de Cambodge\u2014MOURA, I, 264.\n\u2021 Dissertation on Penang and Province Wellesley, 6, Journ. Ind. Arch., I 336.\nnot incompatible with the rights of the owner of the proprietary right, for he did not claim an allodial right to the soil, but merely the right to appropriate and keep for himself as much land as he had the power (usaha) to clear and keep in cultivation. There was no necessity, from his point of view, to ask in whom the absolute property in the soil was vested; he did not claim more than a usufruct, continuous as long as he chose it to be so, and terminable on abandonment.*\n\nThat the soil of a Malay State is vested in the Raja is a doctrine not now to be questioned, though it may have originated in confusion of thought, the exercise of the rights to collect the tenth and to dispose of abandoned land being assumed to imply the existence of a superior right of property in the soil, to which the rights of proprietorship were subor-\n\n---\n\n*In the times of the early Hindu village communities, proprietary rights, as defined by powers to alienate, existed to a very trifling extent. In the more ancient form of community, as has been said, tenures had no market value; and in the later and more democratic communities where rights were more decided, the land was not an individual but a common property, and one man could not without the consent of the others sell to a stranger. Still transactions occurred in the latter case among the members of the community themselves, which showed an individual ownership within that limit. Sales were not common, and mortgages were usually not foreclosed for a very long period; but the latter existed in abundance, showing a certain degree in individual ownership of landed property. Individual property in land appeared earlier than elsewhere in the districts of the western coasts, probably owing to the political circumstances which rendered the Government authority weak and the State demands light. The attitude of the Hindu rajahs with regard to the soil has been much discussed. It probably varied entirely with the circumstances of times and places. The object of Government is to obtain revenues for Government purposes. If it found communities so organized as to be able to farm the villages properly and to render the proper State dues, the Government would not interfere in the direction of the disposal of the lands claimed by the community. If it found an imperfect organization it would be forced to interfere in the disposal of the lands, especially of the waste lands, with a view to the proper development of the country and realization of the revenue. The tendency probably was for the villagers to lean more and more on the Government in these matters, and hence in many parts of the country the State interference became a regular institution. Still there is no evidence that any Hindu government ever took the step of ejecting an occupier; even if they failed to obtain a rent or fine how they limited their rights sale to personal tortures or sale of moveable property. The sale law is not a native institution. The discussion whether the Indian governments are proprietors of the soil, or not, seems to be little more than a dispute about words.\"\u2014Standing Information, Madras, p. 78.\nThe right of the subject of a Malay State to appropriate and cultivate, and thus acquire a proprietary right over land which, though once tanah hidop, has been abandoned and has relapsed into tanah mati, is unquestioned*; it is not inconsistent with any supposed right of the Raja to the soil of the abandoned holding, for Malay tenant right may be established by a cultivator over the land of another. The Raja's absolute property in the soil, is but a barren right, and as he undoubtedly has, independently of it, the right of levying tenths and taxes and of forfeiting lands for non-payment, Malay law does not trouble itself much with speculation about it. Tenant right is the cardinal doctrine of the Malay cultivator, and, as long as that is fully recognised, it does not matter to him who or what functionary or power may, in theory, be clothed with the original and supreme right to the soil.\n\nWhen Malay laws speak of the grant by the Raja of lands already under cultivation to some Chief or royal favourite, it must be understood that what is granted is the right to exercise the royal privileges of claiming from the cultivators a tenth of the produce and of disposing of abandoned and forfeited lands. The Raja's property in the soil is not parted with, and the tenant right of the cultivators is in no way interfered with. The grants of the local Dutch Government in Malacca parceling out the district to a few privileged individuals, which gave\n\n---\n\n* Appendix I, p. v.\n\u2020 It does not appear from any of the Siamese writings examined by me, or from information orally obtained, that the sovereign is the virtual proprietor of the soil. That he is perfectly despotic cannot be doubted. But eastern despots generally encourage agriculture, and however the case may have stood originally, it is evident from the cases quoted in the digests and decisions that the occupiers of the land have a firmcriptive, if not an indefeasible proprietary right in it. Perhaps their Kings may have promised, and with truth, that their own prosperity was linked with the admission of that right; and hence may have arisen the fixed assessment on landed property, which has not altered since the days of the earliest intercourse of Europeans with Siam. It is collected either in kind at 10 per cent, or in money. Ten per cent. on the value of the net produce is here meant. Although this, for Asia, is a light tax in itself, yet when taken in conjunction with the obligation to personal service for the State and with other exactions to which all are liable, it will be found on the whole oppressive. Besides, the Kings will often break through all law, social and moral.\"\u2014Colonel Low\u2014Journ. Ind. Arch., I, 336.\nso much trouble to the officers of the East India Company on their succession to the Government of that Settlement in 1825, were of this nature.* The grantees were nothing more than a species of what are called in India \"Zamindars.\" The absolute right of the cultivators to retain possession of their holdings as long as they paid to the grantees tenths of the produce, was in no way prejudiced, nor was the customary right of every native of the country to take up forest or waste land wherever he pleased and to bring it into cultivation. The grants were in accordance with Malay tenure, and in no sense corresponded with the English idea of a freehold holding. Nevertheless, there are not wanting, on the part of the few remaining grantees, attempts to assert that their rights within the districts granted to them include the fullest proprietorship of the soil, and to act as if they were the owners of the freehold. This is an illustration of the tendency to argue the acquisition of a proprietary right from the exercise of certain powers which, until their history is examined, seem to be inconsistent with any other position. So, in Bengal, the Zamindar, who was, in the inception of the native revenue system, a revenue official, or agent, established in course of time hereditary and proprietary rights and came to be looked on eventually as the proprietor of the district over which he exercised the rights assigned to him. Had the Straits officials from 1825 understood the true bearing of the position, according to Malay law, as the Dutch undoubtedly did (for the same system is recognised in some districts of Java), it would have been possible, perhaps, to have left the grantees in possession of their Zamindari rights, to have assessed the land revenue of their respective districts at a fixed sum, and to have exacted full payment of this, leaving the concessionaire to collect the tenth in detail from his tenantry.\n\nThe following principles regarding land tenure in Java had been laid down by Sir Stamford Raffles only eleven years before the settlement with the Malacca grantees took place \u2020:\u2014\n\n\"The nature of the landed tenure throughout the island is now\n\n* Journ. Ind. Arch., II, 740.\n\u2020 Revenue Instructions, 11th February, 1814.\nthoroughly understood. Generally speaking, no proprietary right in the soil is vested in any between the actual cultivator and the sovereign; the intermediate classes, who may have at any time enjoyed the revenues of villages or districts being deemed merely the executive officers of Government who received these revenues from the gift of their lord; and who depended on his will alone for their tenure. Of this actual proprietary right, there can be no doubt that the investiture vested solely in the sovereign; but it is equally certain that the first clearers of the land entitled themselves, as a just reward, to such a real property in the ground they thus in a manner created, that, while a due tribute of a certain share of its produce was granted to the sovereign power for the protection it extended, the government in return was equally bound not to disturb them or their heirs in its possession. The disposal of the government share was thus, therefore, all that could justly depend on the will of the ruling authority; and consequently the numerous gifts of land made in various periods by the several sovereigns have in no way affected the rights of the actual cultivators. All that Government could alienate was merely its own revenue or share of the produce. This subject has come fully under discussion, and the above result, as regarding this island, has been quite satisfactorily established.\n\nThe following description of the mode of creating these quasi-manorial rights in Java, and the nature of the rights created, from which it will appear that the Dutch in their Eastern possessions have simply adopted the native law of tenure and have not introduced one of their own, is translated from Winckel's Essai sur les Principes r\u00e9gissant l'Administration de la Justice aux Indes Orientales Hollandaises (1880), p. 141. It is entirely in accordance with Malay law, and the principles laid down apply, to a great extent, to the private rights in Malacca which Governor Fullerton bought up, with few exceptions, in 1828:\n\n\"Following in this respect the general Muhammadan law, at least in part, the ancient Javanese sovereigns* used to\n\n* \"This is still done in Java on the lands of the Sunuhunan of Sourakarta and the Sultan of Jokjokarta. But there the thing has been ably worked...\"\npay their functionaries and show favour to their relations\nand favourites, not with hard cash, but by a delegation of\nsovereign rights consisting in the right to exact a share of\nthe produce of the soil (from one to four tenths) and that\nof requiring the cultivator to work (in some cases, one day\nout of every five) either for the pecuniary profit of the lord\nor merely to gratify his taste for ostentation by swelling his\ntrain.\n\nThe delegated ruler (who exercises police control and even\nadministers justice to some extent) is not the owner of the\nsoil in the European sense of the word. He cannot, for\ninstance, evict the cultivator from it; but the latter is obliged\nto pay the tithe and to take a part in the forced service.\n\nOur ancestors found this system in force in Java and\nimitated it.\n\nThese sovereign rights have been conceded by the influ-\nence of money, but in perpetuity, contrary to Muhammadan\nlaw.\n\nThe European governments which have followed have\noften done this and have had cause to repent it.\n\nBe that as it may, in the Residencies of Bantam, Batavia,\nKrawang, Cheribon, Tagal, Samarang, Japara, Sourabaya\nand Pasaruan, there are these 'private lands' (terres par-\n\nby Europeans. They, never natives or Chinese, take on lease, with the\nconsent of the Dutch Government and for twenty years at most, the rights\ndelegated to members of the royal family and to the officers of their High-\nnesses. It is the Europeans, who, instead of using the corele to secure a\nnumerous suite, turn it to account in indigo factories, sugar-mills and coffee\nplantations. Often, instead of a share of the produce of the soil, they\ntake a share of the soil itself. This organisation has given incredible\nscope to European enterprise, has demoralised the native nobility, and\nhas given more intelligent and therefore more indulgent masters to the\ncommon people.\n\nIf, as it is high time it should be the case, these phantoms of sovereigns\nwere deprived of their power, and the administration were put on the footing\nof the 'Government' lands, the source of European industry would dry\nup, and the common people would not gain very much, from a practical\npoint of view; the minor chiefs alone would profit. Effort was made fifty\nyears ago to put a stop to the 'farming out of the land' (bail des terres),\nbut the ancient system was reverted to, tempered by the, by no means no-\nminal, control of the Dutch officials.\"\nticuli\u00e8res). Those of Krawang\u2014only two in number and comprising 318 and 51 villages, respectively, with a population of nearly 180,000 souls\u2014exceed in extent and importance many an European State.\n\nThese little principalities have been objects of dislike to the Dutch power, ever since, dating from the fall of the noble Company, there has been a governing government; to the Company, commerce was always the chief thing. Sometimes the government has repurchased them;\u2020 on other occasions recourse has been had to not very honourable means in order to obtain possession of them.\u2021\n\nIt is certain that these lands, especially those of no great extent and cultivated by Chinese, might support a happier native population. Nevertheless, for some years past complaints have much diminished, thanks probably to the strict control of the government.\n\nHowever that may be, it was supposed in 1854\u00a7 that it was particularly against these absolute principalities that ill-will was entertained in high places, and guarantees were accordingly asked for. The governments protested, saying that such a use of the law of dispossession would be an\n\n* In Dutch, particulier landbezit. The origin of some of these concessions is not a little mysterious. The Bulletin des Lois, 1836, No. 19, contains the Ordinance for the West of Java regarding \"private lands.\" We regret that this interesting subject is beyond the scope which we have prescribed to ourselves. It is too extensive to be treated of in a note. Let us be satisfied with saying that the Court of Justice of Batavia (Boer's case, 5th June, 1878, Indisch Weekblad van het Recht, No. 784) admits as an extenuating circumstance the fact that the Ordinance is incomplete and bad, and that this has greatly contributed to the commission of acts of violence. See the splendid reports of M. van Dissel on the private lands of the East of Java, printed by the Society of Industry and Agriculture, Batavia, 1878.\"\n\n\u2020 For instance, the present regency of Probolinggo in the beginning of the century.\n\n\u2021 Sukabumi, for instance.\n\n\u00a7 At the time of the passing of the Regulation for the Government of Netherlands India, article 77 of which commences as follows:\u2014\"No one may be dispossessed of his property, except, in the public interest, in the manner laid down by a general legislative act, and in consideration of preliminary indemnification.\"\nenormous wrong against which no law could give a guarantee except that provided by Article 24, para. 1, of the Regulation for the Conduct of the Government, which forbids the Governor-General to sacrifice on his own authority the important principles of administration.\n\nLet us admit that an express allusion would have settled the matter better. There is nothing now to prevent, if not the Governor-General, at all events the King, from discovering some fine day that the dispossession of the 'lords of the soil' * would be in the public interest, especially since so many people are already of that opinion.\n\nBut let these gentry be reassured: for many years to come the government of India will not be able to afford the immense sums \u2020 which such a measure would require, even if there should be found at the head of this government a man bold enough to undertake it.\"\n\n---\n\nChapter IV.\n\nTHE METHOD OF COLLECTING THE TENTH.\n\nThe exaction of a tithe of the produce of land is by no means an universal tax in Malay States. In those States which are governed by Rajas, there are also hereditary chiefs who intercept most of the revenue of particular districts, and in small quasi-republics like the Negri Sambilan taxation is practically unknown.

However, we are not competent to say what is the value of lands of this kind. All that we know is that they pay well worked by an European; a little less in the hands of a native farmer; enormously farmed out to a Chinaman.\"\nGovernment is the Krian province in Perak. Before 1874, the coast district lying between the Krian river and Pasir Gedabu was regarded as a personal estate of the reigning Sultan. It contains an extensive area of very fertile paddy-land, cultivated chiefly by Malays of Penang and Province Wellesley, who used in former times to live principally in the British Settlements, giving across to Krian during the padi season and removing their grain, when harvested, to their homes by the sea. The fact that most of the padi was taken out of the country in this way made it easy to collect the tax at the time of export, and at the time I speak of (1874), the headman upon each creek exacted, instead of an assessed tenth, a fixed tax of thirty gan-tangs of padi for every orlong cultivated, in money or kind, before a land-owner was allowed to export his grain to British territory. Those who lived permanently in Krian and did not export their padi had to settle with the Penghulu at the same rate. He kept a roll of the cultivators in his district, and estimated roughly, or by actual measurement, the area cultivated by each.\n\nThe inhabitants of this district paid also a capitation tax of $2.25 per family, or $1.12\u00bd per every unmarried male adult.\n\nThese taxes were not levied in Perak proper, first, because it is not a great grain-producing country, and taxation would have discouraged cultivators and caused them to abandon cultivation for mining\u2014the principal industry of the State; secondly, because the inhabitants of Perak proper were always available for the performance of forced services of all kinds, whereas the cultivators of Krian were a shifting population who spent most of their time in British territory.\n\nIt is evident that the Krian system of collection at the time of export is one not suited to a country in which the grain produced is intended for local consumption. It is not clear how the tithe of the produce of the Naning rice-fields, which, by an agreement made in 1644, became payable to the Dutch Government at Malacca,* was intended to be collected. It may have been levied upon cargoes coming down the river, but more probably it was never effectually exacted. In Kedah, following the Siamese custom, the practice seems to have been\n\n* Newbold, I, 203.\nto require the cultivator, under fear of punishment, to deliver\nthe tax in money or kind at a certain place. \"Grain-holders\nwere forced to deliver the rice into the Raja's granaries\nat the price he chose to fix on it, which always left him a\nprofit of about 20 per cent., nor could they sell grain without\nspecial permission.\"*\n\nThe method of levying the tenth on the rice-crops in Malacca\nis thus described by Newbold:\u2020 \"When the grain is ripe, a\nperson on the part of the Government visits the rice-fields,\nattended by the owner, the Panghulu, or Mata-Mata, of the\nvillage and several of the oldest inhabitants, on the spot, in\norder to agree upon and assess the value of the crop. A dif-\nference of opinion will naturally sometimes arise between the\ntaxer and the taxed. This is submitted to the arbitration of\nthe Panghulu and the village elders. But should these persons\nagain assess the crop at a lower value than the Collector's\nagent really thinks it worth, the latter has still the resource of\noffering to purchase the whole of the crop on the part of\nGovernment, at a price according to the owner's valuation.\nThis proposal, whenever made, has been, I believe, invariably\nrefused. It is not, therefore, improbable, all circumstances\nconsidered, that not more than seven or eight per cent., at the\nmost, ever finds its way into the Company's godowns. The\ntenth in kind on paddy is sold, whenever a good price can be\nprocured for it, on the spot, and the proceeds lodged in the\nTreasury. The tenth on the other articles of land produce is\nlevied at tolls placed at the entrances into Naning from Malac-\nca, and there immediately sold.\"\n\nThis account describes a purely native procedure, for, fifty\nyears ago, when Newbold wrote, just as at the present time\n(1841), no mode of collecting the tenth was provided by law.\nThe absence of legal powers to punish the evasion of the well-\nknown customary regulations does not, however, seem to have\nprevented the collectors from using their position as oppres-\nsively in a British possession as in a Native State.\u2021\n\n* Low\u2014Dissertation, p. 7.\n\u2020 Id., p. 261.\n\u2021 Correspondence relating to the Land Revenue System of the Straits Settle-\nments, 1837-44, p. 61.\nSir Emerson Tennent, in his account of Ceylon, though he describes the manner in which the tenth is collected there under British Colonial rule,* does not state how, if at all, this varies from the practice which obtained under the native administration, but I find a very full description of the collection of a tithe on grain in an Asiatic kingdom in Mourg's *Le Royaume de Cambodge*, which is interesting as shewing the extreme elaborateness of the procedure found necessary. It is instructive to compare the published descriptions of the efforts made during the last fifty or sixty years to collect the Malacca land revenue, one long history of want of knowledge on one side, and fraud and evasion on the other, shewing \"how cruelly the subject has been neglected and mismanaged,\"\u2020 with what this author is able to state as regards Cambodia, \"no difficulty or delay is ever experienced in getting in this tax.\"\n\n\"The rice-harvest is gathered between November and January, according to the forwardness of the crops. Towards the month of January, the King sends out into each province an envoy, who is the bearer of a royal order conferring on him the right of estimating the rice-crops realised by the owners, and of deciding the portion due to the State, that is to say, a tenth of the gross produce. The envoy is always accompanied on this mission by an agent of the Storekeeper-general of Phnom Penh. They proceed together to the province which has been assigned to them, and exhibit their credentials to the Governor. On sight of the King's seal, the Governor prostrates himself three times; he at once causes candles and joss-sticks to be lighted and places them on the ground in front of him, and he then listens, lying on his face, to the reading of the royal edict. He himself at once draws up instructions to the various employ\u00e9s of his province, so that the task of the envoys from the capital may be facilitated everywhere and that the reception to which they are entitled may be accorded to them. Lastly, the Governor nominates from among the local authorities a third delegate, who forms one, *ex-officio*, of the committee of measurement. This delegate represents the interest of the\n\n---\n\n* Tennent's *Ceylon*, II, 170.\n\u2020 Blundell\u2014*Journ. Ind.

As\nsoon as they have settled down and are somewhat rested, the\nheadman of the village joins them and presents 'the civil\nof the oath,' a piece of cotton stuff five cubits long which is\naccompanied by five coins worth about forty centimes, a\ncock, as door-keeper of the sala, and lastly some fresh betel\nleaves and peeled areca-nuts. The headman prostrates\nhimself before his offering, and the royal delegate solemnly\nreads out his instructions. This recital over, the headman\nswears to conduct himself in the matter as an honest func-\ntionary and one anxious for the interests of the State, and\nnot to lend assistance to any fraud calculated to withhold\nany portion of the crops of his district from the researches\nof the collectors.\"\n\nNext they proceed to examine, house by house, the heaps\nof rice; these are valued, and against the name of the person\nliable for the payment, there is entered on a register one-\ntenth of the quantity found, representing the tax due to the\nState; this the proprietor himself is under the obligation of\nconveying to the capital, together with a delivery order which\nthe King's envoy delivers to each cultivator before leaving\ntheir house.\"\n\nWhen the circuit is finished, the Committee return to the\nchief town of the province, where three precisely identical\nregisters are drawn up recording their labours; one of these\nregisters is for the King, another is sent to the keeper of\nthe rice-granary, and the third remains in the hands of the\nGovernor. No difficulty or delay is ever experienced in\ngetting in this tax.\"\n\nRice which has been exported before the arrival of the\ncollectors in the district has, of course, had to pay the tax of\none-tenth at the custom house, and the cultivator has nothing\nto do but to shew the receipt of the custom-house officers.\"\n\nForest produce, such as cardamums, gutta-percha, bees'\n\"wax, etc., are taxed in a different manner. The inhabitants\nof the forest are required to work these articles; the law\nprescribes what amount each family must furnish to the\nState annually, and everything exceeding this is for themselves.\nTimber is charged with a trifling duty when felled and after-\nwards with a tenth of its value on passing the custom\nhouse.\"*\n\nIt is almost incredible that the Colonial Government has\nnot got proper powers for collecting the tenth, but native cus-\ntom is hardly sufficient warrant to enable Courts governed by\nEnglish law and practice to punish by fine and imprisonment\nbreaches of a purely native revenue system, which has not been\nspecially adopted by the Legislature. Governor Fullerton,\nin a minute dated the 18th May, 1829, asked: \"How are we\nto regulate decisions at Malacca? There the sovereign right\nis one-tenth of the produce; the Dutch made over the right\nto certain of the inhabitants more than 100 years ago. This\nGovernment, by way of ensuring increase of cultivation and\nintroduction of population, redeemed the right. How are\nwe to levy the tenth if refused? The land tenures at Ma-\nlacca bear no analogy or resemblance to any English tenure;\nyet by such they must, in case of doubt, be tried. Regula-\ntions adapted to the case have indeed been sent to England,\nbut until local legislation is applied, and the mode of admi-\nnistering justice better adapted to the circumstances of the\nplace, it seems to me quite useless to attempt the realisation\nof any revenue whatever.\"\u2020\n\nThe problem is still unsolved, as the following extract from\nan official report laid before the Legislative Council of the\nColony last year shews:\u2014\n\n\"The valuation of padi before the assessment of the Govern-\nment tenths seems to be carried on in a perfunctory way.\nThe system is purely customary and its details have never\nbeen regulated by any law. When the padi in a district is\nripe, a Clerk (Eurasian or Malay) is sent there. He visits\nthe rice-fields with the Panghulin. A little of the padi is\ncut and examined, and an estimate is formed of the probable\n\n*Moura\u2014Le Royaume de Cambodge, I, 264.\n\u2020House of Commons Papers, 320E, October, 1831.\nyield and what is the assessed tenth. These Clerks are ignorant, and the correctness of their returns is not checked in any way. They are entirely dependent upon the Panghulu for information as to the names of occupiers and the extent of their cultivation. These may vary annually, for it is the cultivator (not necessarily the proprietor, but possibly a tenant for the season only) who has to pay the tenth, and only a portion of a given holding may be under cultivation.\n\nWhen the Clerk has finished his assessment of a district, a copy of his return is made out in Malay and sent to the Panghulu. The latter collects the money from the ryots and pays it to the Land Office, receiving a commission of ten per cent. on the amounts collected. This procedure is sanctioned by custom only and not by law. There is no summary method of punishing a cultivator who cuts his crop before it has been assessed, or a Panghulu who fails to attend the valuation Clerk, or the Panghulu, or Clerk, who makes a dishonest assessment or return.*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter V.**\n\n**Sub-Tenancy.**\n\n\"Persons,\" says the Malacca Code, \"who settle on the lands or plantations of others, must obey the orders of the proprietor, and if they oppose him, they may be fined ten tahils and one paha. It is the duty of all the dwellers on the land to co-operate with the proprietor.\"\n\n*Proceedings of the Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements for 1883, p. 392.*\nThis passage indicates the existence of a class of sub-tenants subordinate to a proprietor, and that the tenant right of these people includes fixity of tenure may be gathered from the fact that a refractory tenant is liable to fine only. There is no hint of eviction. The peasant cultivator, or sub-tenant, who enters into occupation of the land of another, with his consent (unqualified as to time), acquires, therefore, a proprietary right, subject to the right of the other to a share in the produce of the land, and subject to the liability of being fined if he does not obey his feudal superior.\n\nThus one proprietary right may spring up within another, and this may go on ad infinitum; in Bengal, since the permanent settlement, as many as eighteen and twenty distinct rights may sometimes be discoverable between the Zamindar and cultivator. So among the Malays a man who, by his personal industry, or by the co-operation of his family and slaves, or by inheritance, finds himself in possession of more land than he wishes to cultivate, can, by admitting sub-tenants, secure himself an annual return, in kind, of grain or fruit, besides adding to his importance by the acquisition of a number of neighbours who are bound to recognise his superior proprietary rights and to obey him on pain of fine. The first proprietor who, as was stated at the outset, is bound to keep up continuous occupation or cultivation, performs this duty vicariously in the persons of his sub-tenants, and they again, if they choose, create fresh sub-tenancies on the same system.\n\nIf cultivation, or the payment of the tenth, ceases on the part of the tenant for a period prescribed by custom (See supra p. 77) his tenant right lapses.\n\nThis is the explanation of the decision in the case of Abdul-latiff v. Mahomed Meera Lebe tried in Malacca in 1829. The plaintiff, who brought an action to recover possession of a piece of land, was non-suited. Apparently he was a proprietor who had admitted a sub-tenant on the customary agreement to pay one-tenth of the produce, and he desired to regard this as a tenancy terminable at the will of the proprietor. But the Court upheld the right of the sub-tenant, or cultivator, to fixity of tenure as long as the land was kept in cultivation and the tenth paid. (See Appendix, III, p. xxxvi.)\nMALAY LAND TENURE.\n\nIn this case, it was laid down, among other things, that \"the owner of the soil\" (proprietor?) may sell or otherwise dispose of his interest without prejudice to the cultivator, \"and the cultivator vice versa.\" This is, of course, quite consistent with the existence of separate rights, but these are not necessarily confined to two persons, the possessor of the first proprietary right (whom, for convenience sake, I have hitherto called the proprietor) and the cultivator, but there may intervene any number of subordinate proprietary rights, one springing from within another.\n\nWhere a chief or royal favourite or some powerful individual or family has obtained a grant from the Raja, or has usurped the right of the Raja to levy tenths and taxes and to dispose of abandoned land, a relationship between this superior proprietor and the cultivator is established, which soon develops into a system of tenancy, which is not readily distinguishable from that just described. The tenant continues to be the proprietor of his holding on fixed tenure, subject to the customary terms, while the rights of the superior proprietor, be they the creation of the Raja, or inherited, or the result of usurpation, become, in course of time, so fixed and continuous as to favour the impression that they include ownership of the soil. The position, therefore, which the judgment in Abdullatif v. Mahomed Meera Lebe discusses as existing between \"the owner of the soil\" (see note at foot) and the cultivator, may be created either by the admission of a tenant by a proprietor already in possession or by the establishment of a proprietor over the heads of cultivators already in possession. In a Malay State, the exercise of the rights of the superior proprietor are liable to much fluctuation. The despotic power of the Raja in petty Asiatic States is, of course, fatal to anything like\n\n*With all deference, I conceive that the learned Recorder was in error in using the term \"owner of the soil.\" The first proprietor has really only a proprietary right (unless, in Malacca, he has purchased the freehold from the British Government), which depends upon continuous occupation and payment of tenths to the Raja or Government, but, of course, in a district where land is valuable, occupation is certain to be continuous and thus the first proprietor comes to be regarded as the \"owner of the soil.\"\nsecurity of rights of property * and everything depends upon\nthe personal energy and family influence of the person who\nclaims the superior rights. There will always be other candi-\ndates for royal favour who will seek to supplant him in his\nrights if they are profitable (the rights of minors are almost\ncertain to be invaded in this way), and the cultivator is always\nanxious to be recognised as an independent proprietor. One\nman will make good his right to receive tenths from a whole\ndistrict and to regard the cultivators as his tenants, while his\nsuccessor may, perhaps, on some show of opposition, tacitly\nabandon all such claims and leave the cultivators to be recog-\nnised in course of time as separate proprietors. All this is\nquite inconsistent with any notion of \"ownership of the soil,\"\nthough it is easy to see how a systematic and continuous ex-\nercise of proprietary rights would lead an English Court to\nassume that such ownership existed. I entirely repudiate the\ntheory of \"ownership of the soil\" as incidental in any way to\nthe Malay system of land-tenure, and all the evidence shows\nthat the Dutch grantee in Malacca had simply the rights of a\nMalay tuan tanah, such a one as I have described as being put\nin by the Raja over the heads of the cultivators.\n\nThe right of the proprietor to require obedience from his\ntenants raises a new question\u2014the liability of the cultivator to\nforced labour.\n\n* \"From the facts already adduced, regarding the state of landed tenures,\nit will have appeared that the proprietary right to the soil is unquestion-\nably vested in the Sovereign. This principle is so universally established,\nand so frequently exercised, that it is almost superfluous to offer any proof\nof it. Such is the fluctuation of landed property from the operation of\nthis principle that there is not, perhaps, all over the country, at the present\nday, ten jungs of land in the possession of the descendants of those who\nheld them fifty, nay, thirty years ago. The actual effect of the principle\nis, indeed, even more violent than we should be led at first sight to argue.\nThe descendants of those who, no great number of years ago, were in\naffluence, holding the highest employments of the State, and, consequently,\nimportant and valuable tracts of land, may now be seen not only not\ninheriting the possessions of their forefathers, but hardly enjoying the\nbare means of subsistence, and reduced to a level with the meanest of the\npeople.\" CRAUFORD\u2014Report on Nature and Condition of Landed Tenures\nunder the Native Government of Java. Quoted by RAFFLES: Minute on Ad-\nministration of Java, p. 92.\nMALAY LAND TENURE.\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nTHE LIABILITY OF THE CULTIVATOR TO FORCED SERVICE.\n\nIn a land regulation passed by the Governor in Council in the Straits Settlements for the Settlement of Malacca (IX of 1830), there occurs a clause which declares cultivators to be exempt from forced labour. This regulation, if it ever had the force of law, was repealed a few years afterwards, and none of the Land Acts now in force in the Straits approach the subject at all. Whether or not the liability to forced labour from which Malacca cultivators were declared to be exempt in 1830, still survives, though dormant, as one of the incidents of the local customary tenure, is not a question of much importance now, for there is little likelihood of any attempt being made to enforce it on a large scale in a British Colony. But it is clear that, if there had been no existing liability in 1830, there would have been no necessity for special exemption. A code of regulations for Penghulus, which the Dutch authorities were about to introduce in Malacca just before the cession in 1825, contains a clause requiring the Penghulu to keep all roads in order and to call on the tenants to repair them. This, too, assumes a pre-existing duty on the part of the tenants.\n\nMr. Fullerton, Governor of Penang and subsequently of the incorporated Settlements (1824 to 1830), recorded that, under the Dutch Government in Malacca, services were required and labour exacted, from the tenants; that they were, in short, kept in a state of vassalage and servitude quite inconsistent with the encouragement of cultivation.*\n\nThe cultivator or tenant, who was thus liable to be required to work for the Government or superior proprietor, was the holder of the proprietary right which has already been described. In Malay States, the liability still exists, and, for the complete understanding of the re'iyat's position, it is necessary to ascertain, as nearly as possible, what is the extent of his liability to forced service, how far it is an incident of his\n\n* Journ. Ind. Arch., II, 740.\ntenure of his land, what is the mode of enforcing obedience, and what is the penalty for contumacy. With the exception of the extract at the head of the preceding chapter, I have met with no passage in Malay laws which affects these questions; there is no written definition of the nature and extent of the services which a Raja or Chief or superior proprietor can exact from the cultivator. In a Malay State, the exaction of personal service from the raiyat is limited only by the powers of endurance of the latter. The superior authority is obliged, from self-interest, to stop short of the point at which oppression will compel the cultivator to abandon his land and emigrate. But within this limit, the cultivator may be required to give his labour in making roads, bridges, drains, and other works of public utility, to tend elephants, to pole boats, to carry letters and messages, to attend his Chief when travelling, to cultivate his Chief's fields as well as his own, and to serve as a soldier when required.* Local custom often regulates the kind of service exacted from the\n\n* Raffles, writing to Lord Minto in 1811 on the disadvantages of allowing Siamese influence to preponderate in Kedah, thus describes the status of the Siamese peasant:\u2014\u201cBoth persons and property are at the command of the King, and, of course, at the command of his Officers in recession from the lowest to the highest; hence no man will rear what he cannot call his own. Certain months are allowed the many to plant and reap their paddy: and this when stored is sacred and cannot be taken from their possession; with this exception all the rest of their time, exertions, or acquirements may be taken by the King or his Officers if so inclined.\u201d Life of Raffles, p. 52.\n\nThe Burman seems to be little better off:\u2014\n\n\u201cCorv\u00e9es and enforced duties of all kinds are frequent, and the men selected for such service can only get off by furnishing a substitute or bribing the tithing-man. The King or some great man wants to build a pagoda, and orders are sent round to the various circles that they must furnish a regular supply of workers daily. The talk or myo-thau-gye draws up a roster, and each man has to go to work for a certain number of days. If he fail to go, he is tied up to a post or a tree and gets a sound flogging. Similar forced duties are the protection of the frontier and the pursuit of dacoits. Such work is particularly detested, for the men have to keep themselves supplied with food, or get their friends to bring it to them, and this is not always an easy matter. Besides, such service may last an indefinite time.\u201d The Burman, his Life and Notions, 1882, II, 262.\ncultivator in a particular district. Thus in Perak one district used to supply the Raja with timber for building purposes, while rattans and other materials came from others; the people of one locality used to furnish the musicians for the Raja's band, while another had to provide nurses and attendants for his children.* Speaking of Kedah, Colonel Low says: \"The ryot was obliged also to pay for keeping up bands of music and state elephants. His children were liable to be forcibly taken from him\u2014the girls for the seraglio, and the youths for public works or for war, where they got no pay and but precarious supplies of food.\"\u2020\n\nTennent describes \"feudal service\" as prevailing in its simplest details in the Eastern Province of Ceylon. \"According to the custom of the country, the chief of the district directs its cultivation by the villagers; they acknowledge his authority, and, so long as they live on the land, devote their whole time and labour to his service, receiving in return a division of the grain, a share of the milk from his cattle, and the certainty of support in periods of famine and distress. Their houses, gardens and wells, though built, planted and ding by themselves, are the property of the Chief, who alone can dispose of them.\"*\n\n\"These serfs, whilst they live on the land, are bound to perform every service for the lord of the soil, without pay; they fence his gardens, cover his houses, carry his baggage, perform the work of coolies in balams (canoes), fish for him, act as his messengers; and when absent from his village, they must provide food for himself and servants. They\n\n* It would be in vain to pretend to render an account of all the irregular contributions and requisitions to which a people are liable who labour under the evils of a rude and arbitrary Government. At festivals, at marriages and births, whether in the family of the Sovereign or of the Chief who presides over them, the cultivators are called upon for contributions. In the transportation of public property, or the conveyance of the minions of the court or its officers, in the repair or construction of roads, bridges, and other public works, the services of the people are exacted unmercifully, and without thanks or reward.\"\u2014Crawfurd\u2014Hist.

But as they seldom do change, it may safely be presumed that they are contented with the arrangement, and their healthy and pleasant faces sufficiently prove that they are well-fed and happy.\"*\n\nForced service in a Malay State, too, is not merely the result of the application of the law of the stronger; it is well understood to be an incident of the lot of the cultivator of land, he acquiesces in it as one of the conditions on which he holds his fields, and he usually submits quietly to the orders of his superiors until they reach the pitch of oppression at which he decides that emigration is preferable to slavery. He knows that, by emigrating, he will forfeit his land, and in fact it is at once seized by the Penghulu and held for the Raja.\n\nThe cultivator may perhaps receive forgiveness and the restitution of his fields if he returns and submits at some later time, but he will probably have to pay a fine if he is known to possess the means of doing so.\n\nNo incident of native rule has contributed so much to swell the Malay population of Penang and Province Wellesley as this. Kedah has been half denuded of its inhabitants, and Patani, Perlis, Situl, Trang, etc., have contributed numbers of emigrants anxious to escape the unjust exactions of native rulers. But when the system is worked with justice and moderation, there are seldom complaints from the people. In the Krian district of Perak, the people (many of them British subjects), under the orders of the Orang Kaya Mantri, made roads and canals without murmuring, and in the same district, after its cession to the British Government, there was no difficulty in turning out nearly a thousand men in 1874, to commence clearing a line through the forest for a proposed road.\u2020\n\nThe kerah, or forced levy of men for labour, is effected through the headmen of villages or districts. A Penghulu receives the orders of his Chief or Raja to have a certain number of men ready at a given time or place, and runs a risk of\n\n* Tennent's Ceylon, II, 459.\n\u2020 Government Gazette, Feb. 6th, 1875.\npunishment or disgrace if he does not do so. He fines those who disobey, and takes money from those who are able to purchase exemption, so he contrives usually to make the incident profitable to himself. The cultivator who has to leave his house and his fields at this bidding, has to find his own tools and food, which may involve the carrying of a heavy load to the place of work, and a good deal of expense or privation. The abolition of the cultivator's liability for personal service in Java* was one of the facts which Raffles took into consideration in deciding what proportion of his crop the cultivator should pay to the State by way of land-revenue.\u2020 That enlightened administrator was very far from thinking that forced service, as one of the incidents of native tenure, was to be abolished simply, without any consideration given to Government for the concession. It was never for a moment doubted that the right of the Government to exact personal service from the cultivator was inherent in the system under which he held his lands, and the same holds good in Malay countries also. The right of a Malay Raja or Chief to order his feudal inferior to perform reasonable services is indisputable, and the surrender of such a right is a perfectly legitimate consideration for demanding an enhanced land revenue or other equivalent.\n\n---\n\n* \"The system of vassalage and forced deliveries has been abolished generally throughout the Island.\" Proclamation by Lieut.-Governor of Java, October 15th, 1813.\n\n\u2020 \"On mature consideration, and the best advice within my reach, I conceived that a fair equivalent for them, including the acknowledged Government share of the crop, the amount paid in personal taxes and on the internal trade, and the value of forced services, might be found, one district with another, in establishing the Government share, at about two-fifths of the free-crop, leaving the second crop and the fruit-trees and gardens attached to the villages, free from assessment, the cultivator free from personal taxes, and the inland trade unrestricted and untaxed.\" RAFFLES' Minute on Java, 187.\n\n\"The peasant was subject to gross oppression and undefined exaction; our object was to remove his oppressor, and to limit demand to a fixed and reasonable rate of contribution. He was liable to restraints on the freedom of inland trade, to personal services and forced contingents; our object was to commute them all for a fixed and well-known contribution.\" History of Java, I, 154.\nWith the kerah system as practised in Malay States, it is interesting to compare the state of things which the English found in Java seventy years ago. A Dutch Commissioner, reporting on the province of Sourabaya in 1812, wrote as follows:\n\n\"The feudal service was as grievous as almost all the other charges united. The origin of those services must be sought for in the feudal system of the native Government long ago adopted throughout Java. It was considered that all the land was the property of the prince, who only made provisional assignments thereof to his subjects, in remuneration for military and other services rendered. This was the cause of all the lands being divided into as many allotments as could be cultivated, called ch\u00e2chas, each of a size to be cultivated by one man. A certain number of these was assigned to the different chiefs, according to his rank; the custom of the country fixing not only the amount of contributions to be paid from the produce, but the number of men to be constantly kept in attendance upon him. The lands thus assigned to chiefs were exempt from service to them, and the inhabitants were only expected to watch the villages, to make and repair the roads, and to perform other general services of the State. This was the situation of the people with regard to service, when the coast districts were first ceded to the European Government. The system of trade and fixed contributions did not admit of any change, and the services were at that time of very little consequence, and such as could be performed without oppression to the inhabitants; but the case is now quite different. Successively, and particularly of late years, much heavier services have been demanded than were ever before known, and it naturally follows, that the Javan must be kept more at work than before. Besides, it is not possible to apportion those services equally, on account of the situation of the places where the services are required, and because the chiefs, who have the direction of the works, from indifference or laziness, generally make a requisition on the nearest village; and it not unfrequently happens, that many people are thus taken for the public service, who have no lands whatever allotted to them.\"\nWere the requisitions made for the public service alone, it would still be comparatively nothing, it being admitted that the State has a right to the labour of its subjects, but the Regents, their relations, their Patehs, and the subordinate Chiefs of every description, assume the right of disposing of the services of the common people as they think proper, and themselves employ many of them in menial labour of all descriptions, from which it arises that the number of people employed away from their houses on what is called public services is almost incredible.\n\nForced labour is naturally hated by Malays and is evaded as much as possible. Travelling in the interior of Kedah, I have seen the Malay peasant running from his fields into the jungle at the sight of the Raja's elephants, lest he should be called upon to form one of the train. In Perak, the establishment of British influence has led to a general \"strike\" on the part of the peasantry against the system to which they formerly submitted peacefully. A Malay Raja in Perak, who in 1876 was able to supply me with the men of two or three villages in order to convey the baggage and stores of a detachment of troops from Blanja to Kinta, now finds it difficult to procure men to pole his own boat without paying them. Men required to perform work for the Government of the State, as at present constituted, are scrupulously paid, or provided with ample rations. In Malacca, the corv\u00e9e system has never been exercised under British rule, though it is, no doubt, an incident of native tenure, and, unless surrendered by Government for a money equivalent, might very reasonably be exacted for such purely local objects as repairing the dams and other native irrigation works which are necessary for the successful cultivation of the fields of a village or district,* building a balei\n\n*Compulsory labour was formerly an institution in Ceylon also\u2014\"Another institution to the influence and operation of which the country was indebted for the construction of the works which diffused plenty throughout every region, the system of Rajakariya by which the King had a right to employ, for public purposes, the compulsory labour of the inhabitants. To what extent this was capable of exaction, or under what safeguards it was enforced in early times, does not appear from the historical books. But on all occasions when tanks were to be formed or canals cut for irrigation, the Mahamana alludes almost in words of course\u2014to the application of Rajakariya for their construction, the people being summoned to the task by beat of drum.\" TENNENT'S Ceylon, I, 427.\nor place of business for the use of the headman and elders of\nthe village, keeping pathways clear of jungle, etc., etc.*\nBut no words can be too strong to condemn the exactions\nof Malay Rajas, Chiefs and their followers in respect of\nthe family and personal property of the cultivator, which may\naffect any of his possessions, from his daughter to the vegeta-\nbles growing in his garden.\u2020 The goats, fowls, fruit, crops, etc.,\nof the unfortunate peasant whose hut and land are on the route\nfollowed by a Raja on his journey, are, under a native Govern-\nment, at the mercy of his rapacious followers; gajah lalu\norang buat layu, \u2021 the elephant passes by, but men bring\n\n* So, in England, the oath of fealty is still an incident of the tenure of cer-\ntain estates in land, though seldom or never exacted in practice.\n\n\u2020 \"The proprietors of the pusaka have also a claim to the services of the cul-\ntivators; a certain number of them are always in attendance at the houses\nof their Chiefs, and on journeys are employed in carrying their persons and\nbaggage. The lands not pusaka used to pay the same proportion of produce\nto the Sultan as the others did to the proprietors; but the cultivators of the\nroyal dominions laboured under greater disadvantages than the others.\nEvery Chief or favourite about Court had authority to employ them in the\nmost menial offices, and Chiefs possessing pusaka often spared their own\npeople, and employed the others.\" Report on Bantam\u2014RAFFLES' History of\nJava, I, 169.\n\n\u2021 It may be very desirable that I should mention a few of the oppressions\nfrom which it is the object of the present system to relieve the people. I\ncannot but consider the greatest of these\u2014the extent of the personal service\ndemanded not only by the Temunggong and his family, but the Mentri and\nall the petty Chiefs, who had trains of followers that received no stipendiary\nrecompense. These added to the individuals employed in the coffee-planta-\ntions (to which they appear peculiarly averse), in beating out rice for the\ncontingent, in cutting grass for and attending the jayang zekere (native\nmilitia), post carriage and letter-carriers, may be calculated to have em-\nployed one-fifth of the male population of the working men. Another great\nsource of exaction was the large unwieldy establishment of jayang zekere,\nand police officers: the former were liberally paid, the latter had no regular\nemoluments. Both these classes, however, quartered themselves freely in\nwhatever part of the country their functions demanded their attendance.\nThis was equally the case with any of the Regent's family or petty Chiefs\nwho travelled for pleasure or on duty. Whatever was required for themselves\nand their followers was taken from the poor inhabitants who have now been\nso long accustomed to such practices that they never dare to complain or to\nremonstrate. The European authority did not escape the taint of corruption.\nMonopolies, unbridled services, licences, fees, or at least expected presents,\nwere but too common even in the best times, and must have contributed to\nestrangle the affections and respect of the natives from that power which\nshould have afforded them protection.\" Report on Patiuran\u2014Id.\na blight,\" is a significant saying in Perak and sufficiently denotes the effect of royal progresses from the villager's point of view. The practice of the Malay peasant, which must be well known to British officials who have worked in Malay districts, of bringing some simple offering, such as a fowl or two, or a basket of fruit or vegetables, when he presents himself before his superior with some request or application, has its origin in this custom. Such a present is expected in a State under native Government, and a man has small chance of a favourable hearing who comes empty-handed. It is satisfactory to observe the gradual disappearance of the practice of offering such presents, however trifling, for it is a testimony of the general acceptance by the people of the fact that, far from being expected or exacted, they are not even accepted under British administration.\n\nBefore quitting the subject of forced service, it may be useful to notice that Sir Stamford Raffles maintained the right of the renters of Government estates to require the cultivators to perform certain duties, but he stipulated that in such case they should be paid. The following paragraph occurs in his minute of June 14th, 1813:\n\n\"It will necessarily form a part of the arrangement to be concluded, that the renters shall engage to keep the roads and bridges in repair (with the exception of the great military road) and also to furnish labourers, carriages, etc., when required for the public service; but I propose that, on these occasions, the persons so furnished be regularly paid for, at the rate to be established in the leases of each district. This arrangement is, indeed, absolutely necessary if it were only to place in the hands of Government the means of checking the employment of people, on the various pretexts of official establishment, on the public service. At present there exists no check; and as the people so furnished by the Regents, under the existing system, ought to be paid by a proportion of land, it follows either that they are not paid for their labour, or that the Regent is obliged to give up to them a portion of that land, from which he would derive a revenue, and for which, it is naturally to be expected, he will make a proportionate exaction elsewhere. As the whole lands will now be rented.\n\"indiscriminately, this fund ceases, and the additional land thus\nto be rented, instead of furnishing a fund for the payment of\npersons employed in the public service, will provide the source\nof Revenue from whence such persons will be paid, while the\nexamination of the public disbursements will effectually pre-\nvent unauthorised employment of individuals on the public\naccount.\"\n\nIn Java, it would appear from the following extract,* the\nDutch Government proceeds on the principle of requiring that\nall labour which may be legally exacted should be paid for in\nfull:\n\n\"Forced Labour.\u2014Besides the ordinary day labourers, the\nlandlord, whether Government or a private land-owner, is fur-\nther entitled to require the cottiers on his estate to work for\nhim as much as he pleases, but only on the condition of paying\neach man the highest agricultural wages of the district. This\nis the only real forced labour in Java, and the only point on\nwhich the land-owner there has any but a strictly limited power\nover the cottier peasantry on his estate. The labour rent\u2020\nextending all over the island causes no perceptible dissatisfac-\ntion, but the forced labour beyond the one-tenth excites bitter\nfeelings if persisted in. Both the labour rent and the forced\nlabour are applied, on private estates, to the cultivation of\nthose crops which the landowner is growing on the spare land\nfor his own profit, except so much of the labour as is required\nfor the gardos, and for the maintenance of the roads near the\nestate, both which the landlords have to keep up from the\nlabour rent.\"\n\n\"The cottier peasant is carefully guarded from extortion by\nhis landlord, but bound to pay his landlord's share of the pro-\nduce of the land; his subordinate rights in his holding are\nprotected, but kept subject to his landlord's paramount right\nto the soil; and he is practically freed from oppression, though\nsubject to have his labour utilized by his landlord. By these\nmeans the cottier tenant's interests are secured, and he soon\nbecomes rich, from the large surplus produce of his holding\nafter paying his landlord's one-fifth. By the same provisions\n\n* Money's Java, II, 219.\n\u2020 The obligation of the peasant to give one day's gratuitous work in seven.\nthe land-owner is invested with sufficient power over his whole estate to enable him to turn the remainder of his land to the most profitable use it is fitted for. After having thus carefully regulated the respective rights of landlord and tenant, the Dutch are wise enough to abstain from further interference, beyond seeing that the legal conditions are fulfilled. If a land-owner chooses to exact forced labour from his cottiers, and thereby to create discontent among them, the Dutch officials do not envenom this feeling by issuing injudicious proclamations of abstract rights for the cottiers, or of remonstrance with the land-owner. They take care that the land-owner complies with the law, by paying the highest agricultural wages for such forced labour, and they meet the peasant's complaint by saying that the land-owner is only exercising his right, in a manner of which he is sole judge, and that the cottiers must either submit or withdraw from the estate.\n\nChapter VIII.\n\nTRANSFER BY SALE AND MORTGAGE.\n\n\"Land,\" says Marsden, \"is so abundant in proportion to the population, that they (the Malays of Sumatra) scarcely consider it as the subject of right, any more than the elements of air and water: excepting so far as in speculation the prince lays claim to the whole. The ground, however, on which a man plants or builds, with the consent of his neighbours, becomes a species of nominal property, and is transferable.\"\n\n* In Burma \"all owners exercise the right of sale, lease, gift and mortgage, though sale outright is very seldom made. There appears to be an objection to it, which may almost be called religious, irrespective of the rights of heirs, which cannot be alienated; and when land is sold by deed, it is generally expressed that the object of the purchaser is to build a pagoda or other religious edifice thereon. This is supposed to justify the sale. Rice land is occasionally let from year to year on verbal agreement, the tenant agreeing to pay ten per cent of the produce.\" Sir Arthur Phayre, before the Society of Arts, May, 1887.\nbut as it costs him nothing, beside his labour, it is only the produce which is esteemed of value, and the compensation he receives is for this alone. A temporary usufruct is accordingly all that they attend to, and the price, in case of sale, is generally ascertained by the cocoa-nut, durian, and other fruit-trees that have been planted on it; the buildings being for the most part, but little durable. Whilst any of these subsist, the descendants of the planter may claim the ground, though it has been for years abandoned. If they are cut down, he may recover damages; but if they have disappeared in the course of nature the land reverts to the public.*\n\nIn Celebes, in Bali, and in that ill-peopled portion of Java called the country of the Sundas, the cultivator is invested with a kind of proprietary right. By sufferance he can bequeath, alienate, or mortgage his little tenement.\u2020\n\nAmong them (the Sundanese), private property in the soil is generally established; the cultivator can transmit his possession to his children. Among them it can be sub-divided without any interference on the part of a superior; the possessor can sell his interest in it to others, and transfer it by gift or covenant. He pays to his Chief a certain proportion of the produce, in the same manner as the other inhabitants of Java; because in a country without trade or manufactures, labour or produce is the only shape in which he can contribute to support the necessary establishments of the community. So long as he advances this tribute, which is one-tenth or one-fifth of the gross produce, he has an independent right to the occupancy of his land and the enjoyment of the remainder.* * *\n\nThe situation, however, of the cultivator in the Sunda districts, who is a proprietor, is not much more eligible than that of the tenant of the Government: he may, it is true, alienate or transfer his lands, but while he retains them, he is liable to imposts almost as great as they can bear; and when he transfers them, he can therefore expect little for surrendering to another the privilege of reaping from his\n\n* History of Sumatra, 244.\n\u2020 Crawfurd\u2014Hist. Ind. Arch., III, 53.\nown soil, what is only the average recompense of labour expended on the estate of another.\"*\n\nIn the first of the above extracts, Marsden, with his usual accuracy, describes the chief incidents of the land tenure of the Malays, as they exist among the people of the Peninsula as well as among those of Sumatra; and it is subsequently shewn that among the Sundanese in the west of Java\u2014a people who in their customs and language bear a much nearer resemblance to the Malays than do the people of any other part of Java\u2014those incidents which have relation to the alienation of land are almost identical with those which obtain among the Malays. I am inclined to think that the superior permanency of the tenure of the Sundanese, when compared with that of the Javanese, is to be accounted for by a Malay origin, and that it is unnecessary to argue, with Raffles, that it is a mere survival in a remote district of a more liberal system, which once prevailed generally in the island, but which was destroyed by the rapacity of Muhammadan sovereigns. Malays, too, have had for centuries Muhammadan Rajas, not less given to encroachment upon the rights of individuals than those of Java; yet the Malay peasant has retained his proprietary right, and I believe that, both in Malay countries and in Sunda, this has been due to a national feeling or instinct on this subject, not to be found among the Javanese, who, under native rule, were serfs without proprietary interest in the land which they cultivated.\n\nThe power of alienation is one of the most important privileges connected with land that a land-holder can exercise, but it is only the result of an advanced and liberal recognition on the part of the governing power, of the rights of the subject. It must not be forgotten that, even in England, it was not until the Statute of Quia emptores was passed, in the reign of Edward I, that tenants in fee simple obtained the right of alienating their lands at their pleasure, and that the right of devising lands by will only dates from the reign of Henry VIII.\u2020\n\n* Raffles\u2014History of Java, I, 140.\n\u2020 \"We are too apt to forget that property in land as a transferable, marketable commodity, absolutely owned and passing from hand to hand like any chattel, is not an ancient institution, but a modern development reached only in a few very advanced countries. In the greater part of the world,\nIt is not to be expected that among the Malays the system of alienation, or the effect of a transfer, should quite correspond with any European system, and it is necessary to be cautious in supposing that when land in a Malay State is said to have been bought or sold, the transaction has been similar to the purchase or sale of land in British territory, either in the mode in which it has been conducted, or in its practical operation. Crawfurd, it will have been noticed, says that the Sundanese cultivator is allowed to alienate his land \"by sufferance;\" and Marsden points out that the usufruct is all that a Malay has and all that he can dispose of.\n\nWhen Captain Low, in describing land tenure in Kedah, says that land granted by the Raja \"could not be alienated\"*, it must not be supposed that the right-of-occupancy could not in general be the subject of a bargain there. Captain Low quotes extracts from the Undang-Undang Kedah (Laws of Kedah) in which occur the two following sections:\n\n\"When a garden is to be sold, the trees are to be estimated at \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of a dollar each and the amount will be the price of the land.\"\n\n\"What the Raja has given no one can take away, nor can any one sell land so given without the Raja's concurrence.\"\u2020\n\nThe first of these rules exactly coincides with what Marsden describes, as regards the interest in the land which passes by sale in Sumatra, and with Raffles' estimate of what the Sundanese peasant has a right to expect on the surrender of his\n\n---\n\n* See supra, p. 79.\n\n\u2020 Powerful as the Zamindar became in managing the land, in grasping and in ousting, he had no power (in Bengal before 1793) of alienating his estate; he could not raise money on it by mortgage, nor sell the whole or any part of it. This clearly appears from a proclamation issued on 1st August, 1786; the illegal practice of 'alienating revenue lands' is complained of; 'the gentlemen appointed to superintend the various districts are invited zealously to prevent the commission of the offence;' and the Zamin'dar, Chaudhuri, Tilagdhir, or other land-holder who disobey, is threatened with dispossession from his lands.\" Land Revenue and Land Tenures of India.\u2014Baden-Powell, p. 221.\nproprietary right to a transferee. It may be clearly laid down that the Malay cultivator can transfer only the interest in the land which he himself possesses; that that interest, as already shewn, is merely a permanent and inheritable right of occupation, conditional on the continuous occupation of the land on the payment of tenths and taxes, and on the rendering of certain customary services; and that the price to be paid has no reference to the value of the land itself (for, in a primitive state of society, that has little intrinsic value), but is calculated, if garden land, by estimating the value of the fruit-trees, or, if padi land, by assessing at a reasonable sum the probable value of the labour bestowed by the first cultivator in clearing the forest and bringing the field into cultivation.\n\nI have had opportunities of observing the Malay customs relating to the sale and mortgage of land in operation in purely native districts, having been deputed in 1874 to take over the territory on the left bank of the Krian river, then recently ceded by Perak to the British Government, and having since then served for some years as Assistant Resident in the Native State of Perak. I am, therefore, able to speak with some confidence upon the laws and customs which have come under my personal observation in actual practice.\n\nThe technical term used in Perak for the transfer of land by sale is pulang belanja (return of expenses), which sufficiently indicates that the money paid is not a price set upon the land itself, but the recoupment of the outlay incurred by the vendor in bringing it into cultivation. The new proprietor, in fact, does not buy the land; he simply buys out the occupier by compensating him for his labour, that being the factor which originally created the tenancy, and thus obtains the right to stand in his place. It is manifest that he will not pay a long price for a mere right of occupancy weighted by the incidents and liabilities above described; in Krian, in 1874, it was difficult to get ten dollars an orlong for excellent padi land by pulang belanja, but when security of tenure and the full right of alienation of the soil were introduced in the district by the British Government, it became possible to sell the same land for $60 or $70 an orlong.\n\nSo in the case of land on which fruit-trees are growing.\nNot long after the Perak war it became necessary to acquire the piece of land at Kuala Kangsa, in Perak, on which the British Residency now stands. The bargain was effected in strict accordance with Malay law, and the sum which was paid was calculated as the value of the fruit-trees and houses standing on the land. It was clearly understood on both sides that the soil was vested in the State, and that all that the proprietor could dispose of was the proprietary right; the transaction was strictly one of pulang b\u00e9lonja. Speaking of this purchase to Raja Muda Yusuf at Sayong soon afterwards, I was asked by him in a pointed manner whether the late proprietor had sold me the land; the explanation that the proprietor had merely been compensated for her interest in the land, namely, her trees and houses, quite satisfied him and others that Malay custom had been observed, and that the rights of the Raja or State had not been invaded by an undue claim, on the part of a subject, to the soil. This principle has always been recognised in all sales of land in Malay districts in Perak which have come under my notice. But the Malay cultivator is always ready to claim from British officers, whom he may think likely to be ignorant of the real conditions of native land tenure, a larger interest than Malay law gives him, in fact, as large an interest as can be conceded. The official who hears the words \"sell\" (jual) and \"buy\" (beli) used in connection with the transfer of land under native tenure, is apt to conclude that a title to the soil has been passed by the transaction, and he very possibly recognises, or allows to be recognised in a general way, this view of the matter, and so people get to believe, or are allowed to assert, that their position in respect to the State is something quite different from what it really is. This, though it may cause embarrassment in administering the land-revenue of a district, cannot, of course, affect the legal status of the cultivator, for ignorant administration of the law does not alter the law itself. Nothing can be more certain than the fact that no subject in a Malay State can lawfully claim to hold any property in land approaching our freehold or fee simple tenure.\n\nAs the Malay pulang b\u00e9lonja differs widely from our idea of a sale of land, so the jual janji (conditional sale), the only\nform of hypothecation of land known to Malay law, is, in its principal incidents, quite unlike our mortgage of real property.*\n\nThe Malay who raises money on his holding by the transaction called *jual janji*, sells his proprietary right for a sum then and there advanced to him, and surrenders the land to the vendee, coupling, however, the transfer with the condition that if, at any time, or within a certain time, he shall repay to the vendee the sum so advanced, he (the vendor) shall be entitled to take back his land. This transaction differs from our mortgage in the facts:\u2014(1) that no property in the soil passes, but merely the proprietary right; (2) that possession is actually given to the person who advances the money.\n\nIt frequently happens that the conditional vendor (the debtor) wishes to retain possession of the land during the period of his indebtedness, and, if so, this is arranged by his becoming the tenant of the conditional vendee (the creditor). The rent in money or kind which he pays, or which some other tenant pays if the land is not let to the conditional vendor, or the profit which the conditional vendee derives from cultivating the land himself if he does not let it, takes the place of interest, which is not charged, usury being condemned by Muhammadan law.\n\nIf a term is mentioned within which the money must be repaid, and the condition of repayment is not fulfilled within the appointed period, the sale becomes absolute (*putus*) and the vendee takes the full rights of proprietorship. But even\n\n---\n\n* In China, \"a mortgagee must actually enter into possession of the property and make himself personally responsible for the payment of the taxes, before his mortgage is valid: unless explicitly stated, the land can be redeemed at any time within thirty years on payment of the original sum.\" Sess. 90 to 100 of the Code contain the laws relating to this subject, some of which bear a resemblance to those established among the Hebrews and intended to secure a similar object of retaining the land in the same class or tribe.\" \u2014 *The Middle Kingdom*, WILLIAMS, II, 100.\n\n\"Land under Burman rule was never sold in the usual acceptation of the term. It was frequently conveyed for a price from one person to another, and though the transaction was styled a sale, and not a mortgage, it was fully understood that the vendor retained a right to repurchase the land at any time he liked, and that the empior could not re-sell the land without the consent of the original vendor.\" \u2014 *British Burma Gazetteer*, Vol. I, p. 408.\nthen the payment of the money at some later time would, in most cases, be sufficient to enable the conditional vendor to regain his land from a stranger under purely native rule. If no term is fixed, the money may be paid at any time, but until it is paid, the conditional vendee is entitled to retain possession of the land and to cultivate it, or let it, at his pleasure. A short document is generally drawn up in evidence of the transaction, but these are often so loosely or informally worded that the proof of the existence of the condition rests principally upon the good faith of the parties. Sometimes there is no written agreement at all.\n\nTransactions of this nature necessarily led to the investigations of many disputed claims when the rights of the native land-holders in Krian were being settled (see supra, p. 121). The rise in the value of land occasioned by the establishment of British rule resulted in a general rush for possession, men who had long since sold their fields by pulang b\u00e9lanja coming forward to declare that the sale was merely conditional, while in other instances conditional vendees in possession were equally ready to declare that the transaction which gave them their right was jual putus, an absolute sale, not jual janji, a conditional one.\n\nThe native laws contain some curious provisions on the subject of hypothecation, a specimen of which relating to real property may be consulted in the Appendix, p. xv. In all, the peculiar principle of the Malay mortgage, namely, the handing over to the creditor of the property on which the money is advanced, is fully recognised.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter VIII.**\n\n**INHERITANCE.**\n\nAmong the Malays, the distribution of the property of deceased persons is governed either by Muhammadan law, or by national custom, or partly by one and partly by the other,\ne.g., the real property by customary law and the personal property by Muhammadan law.\n\nThere are Malay treatises on the Muhammadan law of inheritance (faraiiz*), in accordance with the rules of which it is common to apportion the estate of an intestate. But there are reasons which often make it clear to the Malay mind that land is a species of property, the transmission of which should be in accordance with the national customary law (hukum adat) rather than with that of the Koran (hukum shar'a). For instance, the wife of a Malay cultivator will generally share in the toil of cultivation; indeed the planting and reaping of paddy is performed almost entirely by women, although the ploughing and harrowing fall to the lot of the men. In respect, therefore, of the crop, which is harvested as the result of these joint labours, the husband and wife are co-partners (sharikat) and this is often the case with regard to the land itself. Under such circumstances, in case of the death of the husband, it would be manifestly unjust to distribute the joint property as his estate under Muhammadan law. The joint property must be equally divided, and the share of the wife having been allotted to her, the share of the deceased husband may, if desired, be distributed in accordance with the Muhammadan law of inheritance. This is only the rightful due of the wife, who, properly speaking, is entitled to be maintained by her husband in a manner befitting his station in life without performing any labour.\n\nI think that it will be generally found that, in the Malay States, the property of the trading class\u2014goods, merchandise, shops, ships, &c.\u2014are distributed according to Muhammadan law, while the agricultural class cling with tenacity to their old customs, and insist that their lands at least, and often the whole of their property, shall descend in accordance with the old Malay law which has come down to them from their forefathers.\n\nThis customary law varies very much according to locality, individual States having often regulations peculiar to them alone.\n\n* \u0641\u0631\u0627\u0626\u0636, plural of \u0641\u0631\u0636\u0647, from \u0641\u0631\u0636 to cut. (Arabic.)\nCRAWFORD mentions the subject very briefly:\u2014\u201cWhere there is a right of private property in land, or at least the usufruct of it, there is generally a community of goods among the members of a family. It is held in the name of the father or elder male of the family, and hence, by the customs of the greater number of the tribes, the father, or nearest of kin, is answerable for the debts of all the members of a family. I can nowhere discover in any of the collections of native laws which have fallen into my hands, that the right of devising property by will had any existence among the tribes of the Indian Islands.\u201d\n\nThis recognition of a superior right in the eldest male of a family and the tendency of the Malays to confine the right of succession to land to the tribe to which the deceased owner belonged, is found in the law of the Chinese also: \u201cThe paternal estate and the houses upon it descend to the eldest son, but his brothers can remain upon it with their families, and devise their portion in perpetuo to their children, or an amicable composition can be made; daughters never inherit, nor can an adopted son of another clan succeed.\u201d\n\nMARSDEN, writing of the law of inheritance among the people of Pasummah in Sumatra, says:\n\n\u201cIf a person dies having children, these inherit his effects in equal portions and become answerable for the debts of the deceased. If any of his brothers survive, they may be permitted to share with their nephews, but rather as a matter of courtesy than right and only when the effects of the deceased devolved to him from his father or grandfather. If he was a man of rank, it is common for the son who succeeds him in title to have a larger share. This succession is not confined to the eldest born, but depends much on private agreement in the family. If the deceased person leaves no kindred behind him, the tribe to which he belonged shall inherit his effects and be answerable for his debts.\u201d\n\n* CRAWFORD\u2014Hist. Ind. Arch., III, 98.\n\u2020 WILLIAMS\u2014The Middle Kingdom, II, 100.\n\u2021 Hist. of Sumatra, p. 230, (3rd Ed.).\nAccording to the Menangkabau law of inheritance, the nephew on the sister's side becomes heir to his uncle's property to the exclusion of the son of the latter. The tradition which accounts for this singular regulation is to be found in Newbold's work on the Straits of Malacca, vol. II, p. 221. A similar custom prevails in the Eastern Province of Ceylon and in parts of India, and there is a Sinhalese legend, not unlike the Malay one, explanatory of its origin.* This custom is still observed in the district of Naning in the interior of Malacca, and in Rambau, Sungai Ujong and the Negri Sambilan.\n\nThe Perak custom differs from this. In that State the lands and houses of the deceased descend to his daughters equally, while the sons divide the personal property. The latter are supposed to be able to create landed estates for themselves, by clearing and planting land which they may select, or, at all events, to obtain the use of land by marrying women who may have inherited it.\n\nHowever, the more active of the Muhammadan priests and mosque officials, especially if they be foreigners and not Perak Malays, endeavour, as far as they can, to get the Muhammadan law of inheritance adopted, to the exclusion of the local custom. The older men are more conservative. From information supplied by an old Imam up the country, I learn that the principle of distribution practised in his district is as follows:\u2014\n\n\"If a man dies without children, leaving a widow, his property is divided between her and the waris of the deceased.\"\n\n\"If he leaves a wife and children, the property is, in the first instance, divided into two equal shares, one of which goes to the waris of the deceased and the other is again sub-divided into four parts, one of which (one-eighth of the whole) goes to the widow and the other three (three-eighths) are divided among the children.\"\n\n\"If there are children of both sexes, the three-eighths above-mentioned are divided into four portions, of which three go\n\n* Tennent's Ceylon, II, 458.\nto the son or sons, and the remaining one to the daughter or daughters.\"\n\nIt will be apparent that there is very little genuine Muhammadan law in all this. Under that system, the widow does not get a half under any circumstances. It is not clear who are the waris, or heirs, who take one-half of an estate to the exclusion of the widow and children. Perhaps it is meant that one-half is set apart in the first place to meet funeral expenses and the claims of persons entitled to share under Muhammadan law, among whom the children would be included. The same authority has supplied me with the following note on the customary law of inheritance practised in parts of Perak:\n\n\"Upon the death of a man possessed of property, his plantations, houses and padi-fields go to his daughters, while his other property, such as cattle, buffaloes, goats, elephants, &c., are divided into four shares: three of these go to the sons and the fourth is devoted to the cost of the funeral feasts. If there is no land or house, the daughters share in the personal property equally with the sons.\"\n\n\"If a woman who has inherited land or house property marries and then dies without leaving a child, the property goes to her waris and not to her husband. If she leaves issue, the inheritance goes to the child or children.\"\n\n\"Property which has been acquired by the joint earnings of the husband and wife must, upon the death of either of them, be divided. The funeral expenses must be deducted before division. The remainder must be divided equally in two shares, one of which goes to the survivor and the other to the children or waris of the deceased.\"\n\n\"The shares of infant children are held in trust for them by the waris of a deceased parent, until they come of age.\"\n\nThe descent of landed property in Perak to the female issue and its restitution to the family if an heiress dies childless, illustrate in a striking manner the tribal instinct of the Malays and the tendency to keep property in a particular family, group or tribe.\n\nEven the wild tribes of the Peninsula have their rules of inheritance. Favre, writing of the Jakuns, says: \"After the\ndeath of parents the whole of their property will be divided amongst all the children in equal parts.*\n\nIn Siam, according to Colonel Low, \u2020 \"the property of an intestate person, should he leave no legal heirs, escheats to the King, who generally contrives to get a portion of the estate of every person deceased. Wills are written or made verbally, in the presence of competent witnesses; and may not be confounded with alienation by gift. Real and personal property may be willed and gifted away to any one, and, as hereditaments, descend to, and are without distinction divided amongst, the heirs at law. The laws of inheritance are considered as applying chiefly to heads of families.\n\nUnder this view, the property of a man deceased is divided into three portions. One goes to the parents and grandparents, one to the widow, and the third to the children and other relations on the man's side according to priority. But should the man not have cohabited so long as three years with his wife, she will only receive one-third of a portion or part.\n\nThe distribution of the property takes effect after the solemnization of the obsequies; and should a claimant, having the power and opportunity so to do, neglect to put in his claim previous to the termination of the obsequies, he forfeits his right.\n\nA person claiming inheritance must personally appear; substitutes being inadmissible. Heirs to property must assist at and bear their share of the charge for obsequies, exceptions being made for those who cannot, from the nature of circumstances, be present.\n\nBefore property is divided, the debts of the deceased are to be punctually paid, and competent witnesses must be present at the division. It does not appear that any distinction is drawn betwixt property of which a female may be possessed, and that left by a man: both are divided on similar principles. The eldest child, whether male or female, gets the largest share. Should the individual have no parents,\n\n* Journ. Ind. Arch., II, 269.\n\u2020 Id., I, 344.\ngrandparents or great-grandparents living, then the portion,\nor one-third of the real and personal property which such\npersons would have otherwise taken is divided equally and\nadded to the two remaining portions, the form of first sep-\nrating the estate into three parts being always adhered to.\nThe same principle regulates the division where there are no\nclaimants to either of the other two shares.\n\nWith this description, and with the customs of the Malays\nas to succession, it is interesting to compare the laws of another\nIndo-Chinese kingdom\u2014Cambodia. I take the following\naccount from a recent French work:\u2014\n\nProperty in land does not exist in Cambodia, for, as is\nwell known, the State is the absolute proprietor of the soil.\nNevertheless, the enjoyment of lands is left to those who\nclear them and employ them for some specific cultivation,\nrice in particular. It happens also, sometimes, that the first\noccupiers are dispossessed without a word of warning, with-\nout the excuse of public interest and simply in order that\nsome one may help himself to a field quite fit for cultiva-\ntion.\n\nThe fortune of a Cambodian is composed of moveable and\nimmovable property, land excepted. Generally speak-\ning, even the richest have not much money, but they own\nboats, elephants, horses, cattle, buffaloes, which they hire\nout; they have sometimes a large number of slaves whom\nthey employ at home either on the products which they cul-\ntivate or in all kinds of commercial and industrial underta-\nkings. Money is lent out at high rates of interest, but it is\nliable to catastrophes.\n\nThe goods of a Cambodian who dies a widower and with-\nout children, go all to the State, that is to the King. If he\nleaves daughters only, the Government takes half of the\nproperty and divides the other half among them. If they\nare of tender age, the goods are deposited with their grand-\nfather who becomes their guardian.\n\nWhen the Government is a creditor of the deceased, the\nKing causes the whole of the debt to be exacted first of all\n\n*Moura\u2014Le Royaume de Cambodge, I, 347.\nfrom the assets, and the balance, if any, is divided among the heirs.\"\n\n\"When the head of a family dies leaving several wives and several children, the child or children by whom he has been more exclusively nursed during his illness share the fortune according to the rank of their mother. For this purpose, the property is divided into seven parts; out of these, the son of the third wife has one, that of the second wife two, and that of the first, four. If these ladies have several children, the distribution is made, all the same, according to the proportion just mentioned. Children who are absent at the time of the sickness and death of their father lose a portion of their rights to the inheritance.\"\n\n\"If there are no children, the first wife keeps all the goods and the family remains united. Were the second and third wife to wish to leave the house before the conclusion of the mourning, that is to say, within three years, they would have the right to do so, but on the condition of renouncing their share of the inheritance. After the three years, if the widows separate, the property is divided among them according to the rule laid down for their children, when they have any, that is to say, the first has four shares, the second, two and the third, one.\"\n\n\"The widows of the same husband may marry again after three years of mourning; the second and third have not got to pay anything to the State for this, but the first wife, if she marry again and be without children by her first husband, must first surrender half of her fortune for the benefit of the royal treasury. If she does not marry again the Government takes the whole at her death.\"\n\n\"An adopted son renounces the right of inheriting from his real parents and cannot be sued for debts which they may have contracted in their lifetime. If the head of a family, after having adopted a child, becomes himself the father of a legitimate child, the adopted son does not lose all hope of inheriting, for the law gives him equal rights with the children of the full blood.\"\n\n\"Children, who, at the time of the death of their father, are in the special service of the King, have a right to three and a half shares of the inheritance.\"\n\"In case a husband, on account of the barrenness of his first wife, marries another who bears him a son, this latter is the sole heir of his father and he provides, after the death of the latter, for the support of the first widow and his own mother.\"\n\n\"The law of the Hindus sanctions similarly the right of the eldest son to the greater part of the patrimony of the father and mother. 'The eldest of the family,' says the law, 'if he be virtuous, may take possession of the whole of his patrimony of the father and mother, and the other brothers must live under his guardianship as they live under that of their father.'\"\n\n\"Generally, in India, distribution used to be made in the following way: the eldest had a double share, the second a share and a half, and the other brothers a single share respectively. The brothers gave to their sisters by the same mother a quarter of their shares to help them to establish themselves.\"\n\n---\n\nChapter IX.\n\nNATIVE TENURE UNDER EUROPEAN RULE.\nINDIA, BURMA, JAVA, CEYLON.\n\nINDIA.\n\nA wholesale modification of the systems of land tenure of ancient and highly civilised communities in British India by the introduction of English law would obviously have been unwise. It has always been the object of British Administrators in that country to recognise native laws and customs relating to the tenure of land, and, in elaborating Revenue systems, to secure that the regulations laid down shall give due effect to every class of interest in land known to native laws. It has been gradually ascertained in the various pro-\nvinces what are the different degrees of right of occupants and proprietors and each interest has received definition in the Land Acts passed from time to time for particular provinces, divisions or districts. In such Acts, the terminology used in describing tenures, classes of proprietors, and occupants, documents evidencing title, and rents and other payments, is largely borrowed from the native languages. The use of terms which have a technical meaning in English law is thus avoided.\n\nSpeaking generally, the ra'iyat is the owner of his holding, subject to the payment of the assessed land revenue. No documentary evidence of title is necessary, though in some provinces he holds a pattu, or official statement of the facts of his holding or assessment. His rights are alienable and heritable, but all transfers have to be registered.\n\nRevenue systems vary in different parts of India; there are practically two. The first contemplates settlement with a middleman; and the second, dealing with the individual cultivator direct\u2014(the ra'iyat-w\u0101r\u012b system). The Government may, in point of fact, either deal with a whole village at once through representative headmen, or may make a settlement of each individual holding.\n\nIn the latter case the settlement of a district is based upon a survey, the soil of every field is classified with a view to ascertaining the proper rate of assessment to be imposed, and eventually settlement records are made up, which include a register shewing the name of the occupant of every surveyed allotment.\n\nIn such a system, there is no place for English documents of title, and the tenure is none the less certain and secure because it is not supported by parchment and sealing-wax. The ra'iyat's name is down in the register of the village to which he belongs, and the extent of his land and the annual assessment which he has to pay are there recorded. The village records and the evidence of the headmen and villagers are at hand to support him if his right of occupancy is impugned.\n\n\"In Bombay (just as in Madras) the occupant holds on 'the simple terms of paying the revenue; if he admits that \"he is (or is proved by a decree of a Court to be) holding\non behalf of some one else, as a tenant, or in an inferior position, then the 'superior holder's' name is entered in the register, not his: he becomes the 'inferior holder,' and it is the superior who is entered in the register as the 'occupant' responsible for the assessed sum. Any one who is recorded as the responsible holder can simply resign (if he does not like to pay the assessment) any field in his holding.\n\nThe assessment is fixed for a period of thirty years, so that a man who elects to hold continuously, knows for certain that during that long period, all the profit he can make will go to him.\n\nAt the beginning of each year, he can signify to the m\u0101mlatd\u0101r (or local revenue officer of a taluk sub-division) what fields he wishes to hold, and what he wishes to give up; as long as he does this in proper time, he is free to do as he pleases. If he relinquishes, the fields are available for any one else; if no one applies for them, they are usually auctioned as fallow (for the right of grazing) for the year, and so on, till some one offers to take them up for cultivation.\n\nNothing whatever is said in the Revenue Code about the person in possession (on his own account) being 'owner' in the western sense. He is simply called the 'occupant,' and the Code says what he can do and what he cannot. The occupant may do anything he pleases to improve the land, but may not, without permission, do anything which diverts the holding from agricultural purposes. He has no right to mines or minerals.\n\nThese are the facts of the tenure; you may theorise on them as you please; you may say this amounts to proprietorship, or this is a dominium minus plenum, or anything else.\n\nThe question of tenancy is just as simply dealt with. I have stated that, if it appears that the occupant is in possession in behalf of some one else, that some one else is recorded as the 'superior holder,' and he becomes the 'inferior holder.'\n\nWhat sort of 'inferior'\u2014whether a tenant or on some other terms\u2014is a simple question of fact and of the agreement or the custom by which he holds.'\n\"If an occupant dies, one (the eldest or responsible) heir must be entered as the succeeding occupant who has to pay the revenue, for there can only be one registered revenue-payer for each field with a separate survey number, though, of course, there may be several sharers (joint heirs of the deceased owner, for instance) in a number. Which of them is so entered, depends, of course, on consent, or on the result of a Court decree, if there is a dispute.\"\n\n\"Sharers can always get their shares partitioned and assessed separately, as long as there is no dispute as to what the shares are.\"*\n\nThe advantages enjoyed by the occupant of land under the survey settlement are:\n\n1st.\u2014Fixity of tenure conditional on the due payment of the Government demand.\n\n2ndly.\u2014His occupation is heritable and transferable by gift, sale, or mortgage, without other restriction than the requirement to give notice to the authorities.\n\n3rdly.\u2014His assessment is fixed, but subject to revision after periods of thirty years. The right of occupancy is not affected by the expiration of a term of settlement, being conditional solely on the payment of the assessment imposed.\n\n4thly.\u2014He is at liberty to resign his entire occupancy, or any recognised share or part of it defined by the survey in any year, provided notice be given by a fixed date. If waste land be available, he may enlarge his holding at pleasure on application to the district officials.\n\n5thly.\u2014He may sub-let his lands, and Government will assist him, under certain limitations, in recovering rents from his tenants.\n\n6thly.\u2014His holding cannot be encroached on by his neighbour, every sub-division of it being clearly defined by boundary marks, and susceptible of immediate identification by means of the village maps and registers. Further, the fact of his possession of any field or sub-division of it can be traced without difficulty in the village records year by year up\n\n* BADEN-POWELL\u2014Land Revenue and Land Tenure in India. 136-8.\nto the date of the introduction of the first survey settlement. Thus the chances of dispute and litigation are entirely removed, or reduced to a minimum. Subject, then, to the part of the Government assessment, the occupant of land under the survey tenure may be said to enjoy every right of property that he can desire, with the advantage of possessing a title the most simple and complete that can be imagined.*\n\nBRITISH BURMA.\n\nThe rights of the land-holder, subject to the revenue demands of Government, have been just as carefully guarded in British Burma. The Land Act of that province (Act II of 1876) is founded upon earlier local regulations, which were themselves an epitome, more or less, of the laws and customs of the Burmese as to tenure of land. The land-holder in Burma has, like the ro'tiyat in Malacca, a proprietary right, but in the case of the former, this right is inchoate until there have been twelve years' continuous possession; whereas in the case of the Malay mere appropriation and possession create the right at once, provided that clearing and cultivation are undertaken.\n\nIn British Burma, \"if a person (not holding under a grant or order of Government which itself determines the extent of right) has continuously held possession of any culturable land for twelve years, and has continuously paid the revenue due thereon, or held it exempt on express grant, he is allowed to have acquired a permanent heritable and transferable title. It will not, however, do for a man to be able to assert former or ancient possession if that possession came to an end twelve years before the Act came into force (1st February, 1879). Possession, on the other hand, is not broken by a succession or transfer. If A has held for seven years, and then sells to B, who has held for five, B can put in a twelve years' possession. So if B has inherited from A. In the same way as regards the condition of paying the revenue. The payment will hold good if it has been made by a tenant\n\n* Bombay Administration Report, 1882-3, p. 32.\nor other person holding under the person in possession. The land-holder's rights are not so well protected, because it is restricted not only by the duty of paying certain taxes, but also by the fact that all mines and mineral productions and buried treasure are reserved to Government as also the right to work or search for those productions in paying compensation for the surface damage.\n\n* * * + + + + +\n\nAny land-holder can obtain an authoritative declaration that he is said, by applying to have his right recorded on a register provided for the purpose, and getting a certificate of the record. There are, of course, provisions in the Act regarding the cancelment and calling in question of such record.*\n\nJAVA\n\nIt has already been stated that, under native rule, the Javanese were mere serfs, without proprietary interest in the land which they cultivated. Under Dutch rule, prior to the conquest of Java by the English in 1811, no proprietary tenure was introduced, and the native system remained unmodified if the following description given by Raffles is a correct one:\n\n\"The Dutch Company, actuated solely by the spirit of gain, and viewing their Javan subjects with less regard or consideration than a West Indian planter formerly viewed the gang upon his estate, because the latter had paid the purchase money of human property which the other had not, employed all the pre-existing machinery of despotism, to squeeze from the people their utmost mite of contribution, the last dregs of their labour, and thus aggravated the evils of a capricious and semi-barbarous government by working it with all the practised ingenuity of politicians, and all the monopolising selfishness of traders.\"\u2020\n\n* BADEN-POWELL\u2014Land Revenue and Land Tenure in India, 700-702.\n\u2020 History of Java, I, 168, (2nd edition).\nSecurity of tenure and protection from unjust exactions are the desiderata indicated in the eloquent passage which follows, written with all the burning indignation with which RAFFLES avowed the tyranny and rapacity of the Dutch Colonial Officials of those days inspired him:\u2014\n\n\"Can it, therefore, be a subject of surprise, that the arts of agriculture and the improvement of society have made no greater advances in Java? Need it excite wonder that the implements of husbandry are simple; that the cultivation is unskilful and inartificial; that the state of the roads, where European convenience is not consulted, is bad; that the natural advantages of the country are neglected; that so little enterprise is displayed or capital employed; that the peasant's cottage is mean, and that so little wealth and knowledge are among the agricultural population; when it is considered that the occupant of land enjoys no security for reaping the fruits of his industry; when his possession is liable to be taken away from him every season, or to suffer each an enhancement of rent as will drive him from it; when such a small quantity of land only is allowed him as will yield him bare subsistence, and every ear of grain that can be spared from the supply of his immediate wants, is extorted from him in the shape of tribute; when his personal services are required unpaid for, in the train of luxury or in the culture of articles of monopoly; and when in addition to all these discouragements, he is subject to other heavy imposts and impolitic restraints? No man will exert himself, when acting for another, with so much zeal as when stimulated by his own immediate interest; and under a system of government, where everything but the bare means of subsistence is liable to be seized, nothing but the bare means of subsistence will be sought to be attained.\"\n\n* \"It is but right, however, to say that the Dutch, while admitting their old Colonial rule to have been most objectionable in many ways, deny the systematic atrocities imputed to them by RAFFLES and CRAWFORD, both of whom, the Dutch say, distorted the facts and working of their old Colonial Government, which was only known to these authors by hearsay.\" MONEY'S Java, I, 57, citing TREMINCK'S Compte d'ail g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sur les Possessions N\u00e9erlandaises dans l'Inde Archipelagique, I, 13.\n\n\u2020 RAFFLES\u2014Hist. of Java, Id.\nTo transmute the serf into a proprietor, and to give him immunity from forced labour and other exactions, was the task which Raffles set himself. To use his own words: \"The foundation of the amended system was, 1st\u2014The entire abolition of forced deliveries at inadequate rates, and of all feudal services, with the establishment of a perfect freedom in cultivation and trade; 2nd\u2014The assumption, on the part of Government, of the immediate superintendence of the lands with the collection of the resources and rents thereof; 3rd\u2014The renting out of the lands so assumed to the actual occupants, in large or small estates, according to local circumstances, on leases for a moderate term. In the course of the following years (1814 and 1815) these measures were carried into execution in most of the districts under our Government, with a view to the eventual establishment of a perpetual settlement, on the principle of the ryotwar or as it has been termed in Java, the tidung-\u00e1lit system.\"\n\n* * * * * * *\n\n\"In the first settlement, leases were only granted for a year, or, at the utmost, three years, and were given to intermediate renters; but in the more detailed settlement of 1814, after sufficient information had been collected on the state of the country, Government determined to act directly with the individual cultivator and to lay the foundation of a permanent system. By this latter period, the experiments had been tried to a certain extent, and had succeeded beyond the most sanguine expectation. Difficulties met us in the way, but they were by no means insurmountable; there were at first imperfections in the system, but they did not affect its principle, and were easily removed. By the zeal, the ability, and industry of the various officers entrusted with the execution of the duty, whatever was practicable in furtherance of the object in which they felt deeply interested, was accomplished. In the course of the years 1814 and 1815, the new system was introduced into Bantam, Cheribon and the eastern districts, over a population of a million and a half of cultivators, not only without disturbance and opposition, but to the satisfaction of all classes of the natives, and to the manifest increase of the public revenue derivable from land.\"\nRaffles' system was the *ra'iyat-wadi* system of Bengal; a proprietary right was accorded to the cultivator, and a temporary settlement was arrived at with him as to the amount of assessment payable by him in lieu of the miscellaneous liabilities of former times. The assessment was payable in money or kind (grain). It was intended that this should be a stepping-stone to a permanent settlement, when experience should have shewn the justice or otherwise of the scale first determined upon. This was:\n\nFor *sawah* lands (rice-fields).\n\n1st quality of soil, one-half of the estimated produce.\n2nd quality of soil, two-fifths of the estimated produce.\n3rd quality of soil, one-third of the estimated produce.\n\nFor *tegal* lands (maize, &c.).\n\n1st quality of soil, two-fifths of the estimated produce.\n2nd quality of soil, one-third of the estimated produce.\n3rd quality of soil, one-fourth of the estimated produce.\n\nChiefs and headmen of villages were continued in office as Collectors of Revenue. Individual rights were recorded in a document, kept for inspection in every village office, in which the name of every land-holder in the village and the amount of his assessment were to be found.\n\nAbout the year 1818, two years after the restoration of Java to the Dutch, Raffles' experiment was abandoned as unsuccessful, and the Government of Netherlands India went back to the system of settlement with the village for the whole village lands. \"The yearly allotment of lands was then left to be made as before, and the legal fiction of the separate property of each village in certain specified fields was abolished.\"\n\nThe present system of land-tenure in Java, which is founded on the native customary law, is thus explained by Mr. Money:\n\n\"Old Land Tenure and Rent under Native Rule.\u2014The old idea under the Native rule was, that the land belonged to the prince, the usufruct of it to the cultivator. The price of\n\n* Money's Java, I. 76.\nthe usufruct, or the rent, was one-fifth of the produce, and\none-fifth of the peasant's labour, or one day's gratuitous\nlabour in the Java week of five days. The Dutch, in re-\nverting to the old system, logically carried out this idea,\nholding that they had conquered the prince and not the\npeople, and therefore came into the prince's rights. They\nhowever, reduced the labour rent from one-fifth to one-\nseventh, substituting one day in the European week of seven\ndays, for one day in the Java week of five days.\"\n\n\"The different systems of land tenure in the island all\nderive from this idea.\"\n\n\"Landlord Property.\u2014Where the Dutch are masters by\ntreaty and not by conquest, the produce rent and the labour\nrent are paid, not to the Dutch but to the Native Princes, as\nin the Preanger and in Soerakarta and Djokjokarta. In the\nrest of the island, where the Dutch are masters by conquest,\nthe one-fifth of produce and one-seventh of labour belong\nto the Dutch Government, except on private estates, where\nthe Government has pro tanto granted away its rights.\nThere the one fifth and one-seventh are paid by the peasant\nto the European or Chinese landowner, and the landowner\npays to Government three-fourths of one per cent. per\nannum on the total value of his estate, equal at most to\none-fifth of the net yearly income.\"\n\n\"Peasant's Property.\u2014The peasant's property under the\nNative system to which the Dutch reverted, is of three kinds.\n1st. Village lands belonging jointly to the whole village\ncommunity, to his share in which every householder has a\nright. These joint village lands are yearly partitioned and\nseparately allotted to every head of family according to the\nsize of his family, and according to their capacity to culti-\nvate the land so allotted.\n\n2nd. Lands formerly uncultivated, which belong exclu-\nsively to the peasant who brings them into cultivation. For\nthese he pays the one-fifth and one-seventh after five years,\nbut is exempt from all payment for them, and from all\ngratuitous labour whatever, during the first five years.\"\n\n3rd. Lands which have descended from the first cultivator\nto his representatives.\nquires the one-fifth of produce to be paid in kind, the tenant\nmust deliver it at the landlord's grange on the property as\nsoon as reaped.\n\nIf landlord and tenant cannot agree as to the number of\npiculs the different fields will yield per bahu, the rest of the\nvillagers are called in, the crop is at once cut down, tied up\nin geddings or bundles of padi as big as can be held in the\ntwo arms, and put up in heaps of five geddings each. The\nlandlord or his agent then takes one gedding from every\nheap. The villagers get a certain proportion of the geddings\nfor cutting down and stacking the crop, which makes it the\ntenant's interest to agree to a rather higher assessment in quantity, so as to be left to cut down his crop himself. The landlord is subject to the disadvantage, in thus having the crop cut down by the villagers, of having to carry away his own share, which also induces him not to insist on quite the highest valuation in quantity he thinks the can bear.\n\nIf the landlord and tenant agree as to quantity, but cannot agree as to the market price, the peasant is left to reap his crop himself, and has to deliver to the landlord one-fifth of the stipulated quantity of padi in kind, for the safe delivery of which the village chief is also responsible.\n\nThe value to be agreed on is the current market value of the neighbourhood in full harvest, and when consequently the price is lower than the average throughout the year. The cottier knows that if the landlord and he can agree as to value, he will have four months time to pay in. He knows that as soon as the harvest is all in, and the produce rent of the neighbourhood has either been sold on the spot or been sent away for export, produce will rise again to the usual price through the year in his locality. It is the tenant's interest, therefore, to agree to both the assessed quantity and value if not exorbitant, while the landlord's estimate is kept within bounds by the tenant's right to pay the actual one-fifth in kind.\n\nLarge European Landowners.\u2014Although, as previously mentioned, the English Government of Java found on inquiry that the Native chiefs did not even claim any propri-\ntary rights in the soil, yet in some few instances considera-\nble tracts of crown land were bestowed by us on Natives as\nprivate estates. On the return of the Dutch all our grants\nand alienations of crown land were recognised, but from that\ntime the Java crown lands have only been leased out, and\nnever granted away. The few Natives, whom we thus made\nlanded proprietors, then entered into the same condition as the\nold European and Chinese landed proprietors, and their\nestates became liable to sale for arrears of land tax or for\nmortgage debt. The reckless and extravagant habits of\nthese Native landowners have gradually alienated most of\ntheir properties, and there are now not above half-a-dozen\nNatives, out of the Preanger and other Native states,\nwho are still owners of land. There is no prohibition a-\ngainst any Native buying any private estate which is for sale,\nbut the practice is discouraged by the Dutch Government.\"\n\nThe culture-system, a description of which does not fall\nwithin the scope of this paper, has been founded upon and is\nin no way inconsistent with the native customary tenure.\n\nCEYLON.\n\nThe land-revenue system of Ceylon is based upon native\ncustom, which, in this respect, resembles the practice, common\nto the Malays and other Indo-Chinese peoples, of levying a\ntenth or other proportionate share of the produce. A local\nOrdinance, passed in Ceylon in 1840, gave legislative sanction\nto a procedure devised for securing the due collection of the\nGovernment share of the crops of paddy and dry grain grown\nin the island. This tax was a well-recognised impost leviable\nby custom and continued by Government proclamations issued\nin the early years of British occupation.*\n\nThe law of 1840, which is still in force, describes the duty\nleviable to be \"a tax of one-tenth or such other proportion\nof the crops of paddy and dry grain grown in and upon all\nlands now liable thereto, as by law, custom, or usage is at\npresent levied or payable.\"\n\n*Ordinance XIV of 1840, quoting in the preamble Proclamations of Sept.\n3rd, 1801, and Nov. 21st, 1818.\nThe mode of collecting the tax was, in 1841, described as follows, by one who had held high office in Ceylon and whose unfavourable opinion of this system of collecting a land revenue was formed, therefore, after some experience:\n\n\"When the crop is sufficiently advanced to enable an estimate to be formed of its possible produce, the Government Assessors proceed to calculate its probable value, and a return is made to the Government Agent of the amount leviable upon every field. The farm of the tax of each district is then sold by public auction; and, as the harvest approaches, the cultivator is obliged to give five days' notice to the purchaser of his intention to cut; two days' notice if he finds it necessary to postpone; if the crop be not threshed immediately, the renter is entitled to a further notice of the day fixed for that purpose; and for any omission or irregularity he has a remedy by suing for a penalty in the District Court.\"\n\n\"It would be difficult to devise a system more pregnant with oppression, extortion, and demoralisation than the one here detailed. The cultivator is handed over helplessly to two successive sets of inquisitorial officers\u2014the assessors and the renters; whose acts are so uncontrolled that abuses are inevitable, and the intercourse of the two parties is characterised by vigour and extortion on the one side, and cunning and subterfuges of every description on the other. Every artifice and disingenuous device is put in practice to deceive the headmen and assessors as to the extent and fertility of the land and the actual value of the crop; and they, in return, resort to the most inquisitorial and vexatious interference, either to protect the interest of the Government, or privately to further their own. Between these demoralising influences, the character and industry of the rural population are deteriorated and destroyed. The extention of cultivation by reclaiming a portion of waste land only exposes the harassed proprietor to fresh visits from the headmen, and a new valuation by the Government Assessor, and where annoyance is not the leading object, recourse is had to corruption, in order to keep down the valuation.\"\n\"But no sooner has the cultivator got rid of the assessor than he falls into the hands of the renter, who, under the authority with which the law invests him, finds himself possessed of unusual powers of vexation and annoyance. He may be designedly out of the way when the cultivator sends notice of his intention to cut; and if the latter, to save his harvest from perishing on the stalk, ventures to reap it in his absence, the penalties of the law are instantly enforced against him. Under the pressure of this formidable control, the agricultural proprietor, rather than lose his time or his crop in dancing attendance on the renter, or submitting to the multiform annoyances of his subordinates, is driven to pursue forbearance by additional payments; and it is generally understood that the share of the tax which eventually reaches the Treasury does not form one-half of the amount which is thus extorted by oppressive devices from the helpless proprietors.\"\n\nThe same process which is here described for the collection of the tax upon rice lands in the valleys is resorted to for realising that upon dry grain in the uplands and hills; and it is a striking confirmation of the discouragement to the extension of agriculture, which is inseparable from a system so vexatious and so oppressive, that by a return of the produce of the paddy tax and that on dry grain for the years prior to 1846, during which the cultivation of every other description of produce had been making extensive advances, it was shewn that the production of corn had been for some time stationary in Ceylon; and the increase has been very inconsiderable since.\"*\n\n---\n\nChapter X.\n\nLAND TENURE IN MALACCA UNDER EUROPEAN RULE.\n\nBritish rule in Malacca dates from 1825, the year in which the cession arranged by the treaty with the Netherlands of\n\n*Sir Emerson Tennent's Hist. of Ceylon, II. 170, n.\n1824 was carried into effect. It is true that from 1795 to 1818, Malacca had been held by the English, but this was more in the nature of a military occupation, which might come to an end at any time on the cessation of war, than permanent civil administration. As far as can be learned, the Government of Malacca between 1795 and 1818 went on very much as it had under the Dutch, save for the removal of restrictions on cultivation and trade and for the humane reforms of Lord Munro in the criminal procedure.* At all events at first, documents dealing with rights in land were made out in the Dutch language for the signature of the English Governor.\n\nTaking 1825 as the starting point, what was the land tenure of the Settlement as the British found it in that year? I reply unhesitatingly that it was the native tenure of the Malays, unchanged in any way either by Portuguese or Dutch rulers.\u2020 All the evidence supports this, the absence of any express land laws or regulations passed during the preceding period of European rule, the fact that such records as we have of the Dutch administration exhibit the government upholding the customary rules of native tenure, the fact that in their other eastern possessions the Dutch have consistently maintained the native tenure as they found it, and the fact that at the date of the final cession of Malacca a code of regulations was under the consideration of the Dutch Government, which is founded in all respects upon local custom and has nothing in common with any European system.\n\nThere were very good reasons why the tenure of Malacca should not have been interfered with. The Portuguese rule was the mere military occupation of a fortress, by which the command of the Straits, and thereby of the eastern trade, was\n\n* \"Malacca was to have been restored to the Dutch at the peace of Amiens, in 1802; but war recommenced (May 1803) before the transfer was made, and the Dutch, falling again under the gripe of France, it consequently remained in the hands of the British until 1818. The law of Holland continued to be administered, and the decrees of the courts of justice passed in the name of their High Mightinesses.\"\u2014Newbold, I, 126.\n\n\u2020 \"The Portuguese, while they held Malacca, and, after them, the Dutch, left the Malay customs, or lex non scripta, in force.\" See the judgment of Sir Benson Maxwell in Sahrip v. Mitchell and ano., Appendix, p. xli.\nmaintained. They were frequently besieged, and the enemy was on more than one occasion up to their very gates. It would be absurd to suppose that any new land system was devised or introduced for the limited area covered by the fort and town in those troublous times. The Dutch drove out the Portuguese in 1640. At no time during their occupation did the Dutch open up the interior by means of roads: their forts at St. John's hill and elsewhere shew that the suburbs were not always peaceful, and there is little reason to suppose that their direct rule extended far from the town of Malacca itself. The whole object of their establishment was trade, and, in the words of an English official who had studied the subject, \"Malacca was considered a mere outpost of the 'Supreme Colonial Government in Java for securing Dutch supremacy and monopoly in the Straits. Not only was agriculture discouraged, but it was absolutely prevented. The cultivation of grain was forbidden as interfering with monopoly in Java, and other species of tropical cultivation were equally disallowed from the same cause.'\" Among the sources of revenue of the Dutch Government before 1795 there is no mention of land revenue, and the absence of this item is sufficiently accounted for by the statement just quoted.\n\nThe Dutch did not introduce any land laws, or derive any public revenue from land, but they fully recognised individual rights in land, and supplied the means of proving title by written documents. These rights were, for the most part, rights acquired under the local native customs, and the manner in which they were transferred was quite in keeping with the native mode of thought. I have already quoted (sup., p. 120) a passage from the Kedah laws in which it is laid down\n\n* Journ. Ind. Arch., II, 737; Id. X, 45.\u2014\"Though under the dominion of an European power for about 250 years, it remains, even to the foot of the lines of the town, as wild and uncultivated as if there had never been a settlement formed here, and except by the small river that passes between the fort and town, you cannot penetrate into the country in any direction above a few miles; nor is even this extent general, being confined to the roads that run along the sea-shore\u2014about two miles each way and one that goes inland (about four miles).\"\u2014Capt. Lennox's Journal, 1796.\u2014Journ. Straits Branch R. A. S., No. 7, p. 62.\nthat the Raja's concurrence shall be necessary to validate a transfer made by a land-owner to another. This is the principle upon which the Dutch documents of title, still extant in Malacca, seem to have been issued. A purchaser or inheritor of land had to go before the Court of Justice and declare and prove the transaction by which he claimed possession of the land. Upon satisfactory proof being adduced, the Court confirmed the transfer or transmission and issued to him a document in the nature of a certificate of his right of possession, that is of his proprietary right under the local law.\n\nThe greater part of the land in the town of Malacca is held in this manner, and it has been hastily assumed that the certificates of the Dutch Court of Justice have superseded earlier grants issued to the original proprietors. I do not believe that there is, in the majority of cases, any foundation for such an assumption. Land in the town and suburbs of Malacca was in the possession of individuals before the Dutch occupation\u2014and before the Portuguese conquest for the matter of that. It was held and continued to be held either by the native possessors or by new-comers, with or without the permission of the ruling authority, under the local tenure. Only, after the establishment of a Court of Justice by the Dutch, secret alienation was not permitted. A transfer of land had to receive the sanction of the government, in whom theoretically the soil was vested, and this, as has been shewn, is quite in accordance with Malay ideas.\n\nThe uncertainty attending the terms on which such land could be held is clearly evidenced in some of the Dutch documents. Sometimes it is expressly declared that the land is subject to any taxes, &c., which may at any future time be imposed, and this sufficiently indicates that the terms ultimately to be imposed were not settled, though it was well understood that land was liable to a customary tax if the Government should at any time choose to exact it. But, as I have shewn, no land revenue was collected in Malacca in Dutch times and presumably no tax was ever imposed. The land on which the town of Malacca stands pays no rent, tax or revenue of any kind to the Government, to this day. But there can be little doubt that it is open to the Government of\nThe right of the company to purchase land has been permitted under the terms of the land purchasing scheme was only granted for each quarter. Under these circumstances, the company must have purchased land at their own expense, and\n\n* News of the M. W. L. Lewis, Assistant Resident of Malacca.\n\n** See comment in the Malacca Chronicle, 1st April, 1853 square miles, of which 3,653 acres only were cultivated.\nit was only under the British Government, after 1795, that they began to be valuable.\n\nThe land-holders, then, in Malacca, at the time that the British took possession of the place finally in 1825, were of three classes:\u2014\n\n1.\u2014Holders of land in the town and suburbs, with or without certificates of the Court of Justice;\n2.\u2014Proprietors of concessions, in the nature of Zamindari rights, over country lands;\n3.\u2014Native cultivators having a proprietary right;\u2014all holding under the local customary tenure of the country.\n\nIt was difficult at first for the officers of the new Government to obtain accurate information as to the state of the tenure. The persons belonging to the second of the three classes just enumerated\u2014\"proprietors,\" as they called themselves, \"tithe-owners\" or \"impropriators,\" as Mr. Young termed them\u2014commenced by making wholly inadmissible claims. For a time it seemed as if the whole of the land of the Province, beyond the town-limits, was the absolute property of \"proprietors,\" whether cultivated land, waste land, or forest. There was no one to appeal to for information as to the nature of the tenure except the \"proprietors\" themselves and their friends and relations. Such information as they could or would give will be found in the minutes of a meeting held by the Resident Councillor on the 10th of October, 1825 (Appendix II). They claimed the unqualified ownership of hundreds of square miles of land, the greater part of which was uncleared forest because, though the rights granted in respect of it had been conferred with a view to its being cleared, the Dutch Government had never enforced this stipulation! They called the cultivators their \"tenants,\" and denied the right of any one to settle on their alleged estates without permission; yet they admitted the right of a \"tenant\" to sell, mortgage and devise his land and to extend his property by taking up waste land at will. They alleged a customary right to collect\n\n* Correspondence relating to the Land Revenue System, S.S.\u2014Mr. Young's 3rd Report, pp. 51-75.\na rent which was ordinarily a tenth of all produce, but admitted that they had no right to levy a higher rate.\n\nIt need hardly be said that this description was not sufficient to convince the Governor (Mr. Fullerton) that the relative rights of Government, \"proprietor\" and \"tenants\" had been correctly stated.* He pointed out the inconsistencies which occurred in the information elicited at the meeting, and the claims of the concessionaires to be absolute owners were never recognised. It was made clear by the production of a Dutch Proclamation, dated 14th December, 1773, and a later one dated 20th May, 1819 (Appendix IV), that the latter were forbidden, under pain of a heavy fine, from levying more than one-tenth of the produce from the cultivators. This satisfied the Governor that all that had ever been given up by the Dutch Government to the concessionaires was the right of collecting the tax of one-tenth of the produce, and that no valid claim could be made out to any absolute right of ownership of the soil. It was decided to redeem the rights which had been thus given up, and in 1828 these were repurchased by Government from the concessionaires, who received in lieu of them hereditary allowances calculated according to the respective values of the concessions so re-acquired by Government. In a few cases, owing to absence from the Settlement, or incapacity to contract, on the part of the persons entitled, the re-purchase of the right of levying the tenth was not carried out, and this right is, therefore, still enjoyed by a few individuals in Malacca.\n\nThe lands at Malacca, having been just freed from the incubus of a middleman between Government and the cultivator, were taken in hand by the authorities. A Superintendent of Lands was appointed, and a Regulation for the Administration of the Land Revenue Department was passed on the 25th June, 1828, which, after approval by the Board of Directors, became Regulation IX of 1830.\n\nThe foundation of much of the mal-administration that has followed may be traced to this very incomplete measure. The Government ought then to have decided whether the tithe\n\n* See Mr. Fullerton's minute, Appendix II, p. xxx.\nsystem was to be persisted in or not; whether land was thenceforth to be taken up in the old way and to be subject to the payment of tenths, or whether any other system of tenure was to be introduced. But what was done was this:\n\n1. The Government determined to collect the tenth on produce which had just been re-acquired from the former tithe-owners, and toll-houses were erected throughout the country to intercept produce on its way to market.\n\n2. A determination was announced to survey the holdings of the then cultivators and to issue \"title-deeds\" for them. This was not carried out.*\n\n3. For lands disposed of subsequently, grants and leases were to be issued under English law.\n\n4. The Regulation was silent as to the method of enforcing the levy of the tenth.\n\nIs it surprising that the result has been incessant confusion ever since? Here was a native tenure easily intelligible and suited to the customs and traditions of the people. It was possible to carry it out in its entirety by encouraging the exercise of the free right of taking up land for agricultural purposes and the acquisition of an alienable proprietary right, subject to the payment of tenths, and by providing legal machinery for the collection of tenths and the punishment of persons evading payment. It was possible, on the other hand, to abandon it, to levy an assessment (founded, as in India, on a rough survey or estimate of area) in lieu of it, and to alienate lands in the future on this system. But neither of these systems was adopted. The old lands cultivated and liable to tenths before 1830 remained subject to the native customs, but they were not identified by registration or survey. Lands taken up and brought into cultivation without permission after 1830 could not, therefore, in subsequent years, be dis-\n\n* \"A Surveyor was appointed, but before he had been many months employed, his services were dispensed with in the general reduction, and in consequence until this day (1856), except in the immediate vicinity of the town, the lands are not measured, nor do the tenants hold any documents to prove their rights.\" Journ. Ind. Arch., X, 61.\ntinguished from them. The tithe system was maintained, but\nthe toll-houses proved to be a nuisance and at the same time\nan inefficient means of collecting the tax. It must have been\nobvious that much produce liable to the tax would not pass\nthe toll-houses at all, while, on the other hand, produce exempt\nfrom taxation, i.e., that derived from the lands of Penghulus,\netc., and from lands leased or granted on a quit-rent after\n1830, would very likely be charged. The outlook from the\nfirst was not promising, and two important facts\u2014one legal and\nthe other administrative\u2014tended to aggravate all the other\ndifficulties. One was the decision of the Recorder, Sir B.\nMalkin,* \"that the introduction of the King's charter into\nthese Settlements had introduced the existing law of Eng-\nland also, except in some cases where it was modified by\nexpress provision, and had abrogated any law previously\nexisting,\"\u2020 and the other was the alteration in the form of\ngovernment and the reduction of establishments which took\nplace about 1830. Thenceforward there were only two officers\nto perform all the executive and judicial duties of the station.\u2021\n\nThe Malacca Land Regulation (IX of 1830) was not long\nregarded as law. It was passed by the same authority as the\nSingapore Land Regulation, which was judicially declared\nby Sir B. Malkin, to be illegal because it was not a\nRegulation \"for imposing duties and taxes,\" those being the\nonly purposes for which the Governor in Council of Prince of\nWales' Island, Singapore and Malacca could legislate.\u00a7\n\nChanges in the law and in the Government were followed\nsoon afterwards by the Naning War (1831-2). So it will be\nseen that the years which immediately followed the cession of\nMalacca were characterised by a number of incidents which\nrendered the establishment of a successful administration of\nthe Land Department a very difficult operation.\n\n* Rodyk v.

On the continent of India, the Governments are invested with legislative power, and that power is exercised in prescribed form, by the enactment and promulgation of laws registered in the Judicial Department, under the term of Regulations. Those Regulations, besides providing for the forms of administering justice, define the relative rights of the Government and the subject, and prescribe the mode under which those rights are to be inferred on the one part, maintained on the other, by application to local Provincial Courts, bound to act according to those Regulations. The Supreme Courts have no jurisdiction in any matters of Revenue, or the collection thereof. In the Revenue Department, public officers hold summary powers of enforcing, in the first instance, all demands, whether for payment of arrears, ejecting from lands unduly held, leaving the onus prosequendi on the party supposing himself aggrieved, distrain when no arrear is due, or ejectment from lands properly belonging to him. It is only under the exercise of the summary process that the collection of the Government Revenue in India is insured. In these eastern settlements the Government has no power of framing those legislative provisions. There does not, therefore, exist any distinct and clear definition of relative rights, or prescribed mode of enforcing and preserving them. There are no Provincial Courts acting under local law. Government possesses no power of enforcing its demands. The Court administering justice as a Revenue Court is a King's Court, framed on the English model, and taking the common law of England as its guide. Questions of Revenue, there-\nfore, whether arising from land or excise, fall to be tried under principles that have no relation or resemblance to the local situation of the country and its inhabitants. Before demands can be enforced, legal process in all the English forms must be resorted to; writs of ejectment must be sued for; suits entered for arrears; delays, expenses, doubts and difficulties arise that render it easy for the people to evade the payment of all demands, and induce the officers of Government rather to abandon the demand, small in individual cases, though considerable in the aggregate, rather than encounter all the difficulties and go through forms which they cannot understand. Let us suppose, for example's sake, that the Supreme Court at Calcutta were at once declared the only Revenue Court; that every arrear of Revenue, every question resulting from its collection, or the occupation of land, were to be tried there in the first instance, under all its forms; would it possible to realize the Land Revenue? Yet this, in a small way, is exactly our case. Singapore, indeed, is of recent acquisition, and the titles hitherto given have been in English form; but even at Singapore, there is much land occupied without any title whatever; and unless something is done by regular enactment, possession will make a title, as it has done in this Island, from the neglect of the local authorities. But how are we to regulate decisions at Malacca? There the sovereign right is one-tenth of the produce; the Dutch made over the right to certain of the inhabitants more than 100 years ago. This Government, by way of insuring increase of cultivation and introduction of population, redeemed the right. How are we to levy the tenth, if refused? The land tenures at Malacca bear no analogy or resemblance to any English tenure; yet by such they must, in case of doubt, be tried. Regulations adapted to the case have indeed been sent to England, but until local legislation is applied, and the mode of administering justice better adapted to the circumstances of the place, it seems to me quite useless to attempt the realization of any Revenue whatever.\n\nReferences to Bengal on the many vexed questions relative to the occupation and alienation of land in the Straits were\nincessant for the next ten years. Each of the three Settlements had its separate history and its peculiar administrative difficulties, and it was no easy task to find out and apply the proper remedies in each. In 1837 the Supreme Government in Calcutta gave effect to some of Sir B. Malkin's recommendations by repealing the local Land Regulations (the legality of which was more than doubtful),* with a view to the introduction of a general Land Law, and by passing an Act (No. XX of 1837) which modifies, in the Straits, the English law of succession and makes all immoveable property descend to the executor or administrator and not to the heir.\u2020 In the same year a Commissioner (Mr. Young) was despatched from India to the Straits Settlements to settle existing disputes and difficulties about titles to land and to report on the whole subject. He visited Malacca in 1838, and again there was an opportunity of putting the land revenue system on an intelligible basis, either by ascertaining, and formally enacting as law, the native customs relative to the collection of the tenth (as was done in Ceylon a few years later\u2021), or by establishing by law the principle of an assessment in money, instead of the tax in kind, to be levied on the cultivated area as in India.\n\nMr. Young recommended neither. He deprecated legislation, and preferred to trust (the result has shewn how vainly) to argument and persuasion to induce the Malays to commute the tithe for a fixed annual payment in money. The idea started in Regulation IX of 1830, that each cultivator was to have a title-deed for his holding, seems to have taken complete possession of that generation of Land Revenue officials and the object of every succeeding administration seems similarly to have been to force documents of title upon an unwilling population. The toll-houses were discontinued and the voluntary commutation plan was tried. Its complete failure was thus described by Mr. E. A. Blundell in 1848:\n\n---\n\n* Act X of 1837, s. 1.\n\u2020 See Sir B. Malkin's letter to the Government of India, dated July 17, 1837; Report of Indian Land Commissioners, p. 85.\n\u2021 Sup., p. 145.\n\"He (Mr. Young) seems to have brought to notice the very objectionable system of levying a revenue in kind on the produce of the lands, and to have induced the resort to a commutation of the tenths into a money payment, but unfortunately the mode adopted either by or through him, was one that proved most unpalatable to the natives of the place, and by its enforcement led to much vexation and dissatisfaction. This novel mode of raising a land revenue was by means of technical English legal indentures between the tenants and the East India Company, drawn up with all the precision and formality of a practising attorney in England, whereby the tenant engages to pay so much per annum, and the East India Company engages not to demand any more, during a period of twenty years from the date of signing. This legal document occupies the whole of one side of a sheet of foolscap, while the other is filled with Malayan writing purporting to be a translation of the English, but as may well be supposed, failing entirely to convey to a native reader any idea of its meaning. It requires some knowledge of law to understand the English original, considering that it is drawn up in strictly legal terms, and the attempt to translate those terms into Malay has produced an utterly unintelligible jumble of words. Indentures being duplicate documents are of course required to be signed, sealed and delivered in duplicate by each party in the presence of witnesses. To secure therefore the payment (often of a few annas only per annum) the tenants (ignorant Malay peasants) were sent for in shoals to put their marks to these sheets of foolscap paper filled with writing. They naturally got alarmed and evinced the greatest reluctance to affix their signature. To overcome this reluctance and to induce a general signing throughout, seems to have been the great and almost sole object of the Land Department from that time to the present. All the ingenuity of Residents and Assistants has been exerted to this end and all the principles of political economy have been exhausted in endeavouring to explain the advantages of the system, but in many parts without success. Threats, coaxings and explanations have been set at defiance, and an obstinate determi-\nnation evinced not to sign these legal papers. In 1843 or 1844, the then Resident hit on the notable plan of punishing the recusants for their contumacy by putting their tenths up to auction and selling them to a Chinaman, the very thing that formed one of the grounds for redeeming the lands from the proprietors!\n\nThe Government had redeemed the rights granted in the days of Dutch rule to a few privileged \"proprietors\" and the worst that was said of the bargain for some years was that it had been rashly and improvidently concluded and had resulted in an annual loss to Government. But as time went on it was discovered that the Government had by no means acquired, as had been supposed, an unfettered right to deal with the waste land of Malacca. The deeds by which the \"proprietors\" surrendered their rights to Government contained a stipulation to the effect that, in case the Settlement of Malacca should ever be given up to any other Power, they should be restored to their original position with respect to the lands.* This proviso effectually prevented the Government from giving a clean title to purchasers.\n\nThe legal difficulty thus engendered, and the acknowledged failure of the voluntary commutation plan, necessitated reference once more to the Government of India, and in 1861 a Bill was introduced in the Legislative Council of India, which, it was hoped, would give the local authorities all the necessary powers. During a debate on this measure, the law officer of the Government (Mr. Sconce) read to the Council an extract from a letter written by Mr. Blundell, ex-Governor of the Straits Settlements, in which the injurious effect of the exaction of the tenth in kind was pointed out. He further explained that twenty years earlier an attempt had been made to commute the payment in kind to a money payment, which had failed \"from the bad way in which it was carried out,\" and that many disputes had arisen from the inefficiency of the native surveyors, \"whose surveys were so bad that constant disputes were arising in consequence of them, many lands having been assigned twice over.\" To meet\n\n* Journ. Ind. Arch., X, 60-61.\nthis difficulty the Bill provided for a survey and a summary settlement of the rights of parties, \"which would put an end to disputes.\"*\n\nThe Bill in due time became law and, as Act XXVI of 1861, is still in force in the Colony. It settled summarily all difficulties as to the title of the Government to the lands over which the Dutch grantees had once had rights, by vesting the lands in question in fee simple in Her Majesty and thus forever extinguished any hopes which the former grantees might have entertained of regaining possession, at some future time, of the surrendered rights.\n\nIt also declared what was the legal status of certain classes of native land-holders and provided a scheme of survey and settlement, analogous to the Indian system, under which the rights and liabilities of every one could be ascertained and recorded.\n\nBut thirty years had been lost and the lands taken up with or without authority in that period were now not to be distinguished from the lands which were held under the local customary tenure at the time when Regulation IX of 1830 was passed.\u2020 The duty to be undertaken was a completely new survey of the Settlement of Malacca, in the course of which the status of every person claiming to have title to land was to be ascertained and declared; and this was not facilitated by any earlier survey and settlement, for the provisions of Regulations IX of 1830 in this respect had been allowed to remain a dead letter.\u2021\n\nThe Act contemplated (s. 1) two classes of native land-holders, namely, (1) \"cultivators and resident tenants\" of the lands redeemed from the Dutch grantees, and of lands in Naning \"who hold their lands by prescription;\" \u00a7\n\n(2) \"All other cultivators and under-tenants who now occupy or hold, or shall occupy or hold, any of such lands as aforesaid.\" Those who could prove a proprietary right under\n\n* Bengal Hurkaru, January 19th, 1861.\n\u2020 See p. 151.\n\u2021 See supra, p. 154, note.*\n\u00a7 i.e., by local custom, usage or law, Sahrip v. Mitchell, Appendix III, p.\nthe local customary tenure, and who came, therefore within the first category, were declared to be liable to a payment, either in money or kind, of one-tenth part of the produce of the land to Government.\n\nThose (class 2), whose occupation was independent of the native customary tenure were to be treated as squatters under the Straits Land Act (Act XVI of 1839, s 2) and had the alternative of \"engaging for\" their land on terms fixed by the Government, or of removing from it altogether.\n\nPower was given to the Governor to commute the customary liability of a land-holder to pay tenths in kind, for a sum down and an annual quit-rent.\n\nWaste land at the disposal of Government was to be alienated, in the discretion of the Governor, to applicants, in perpetuity or for any term of years and subject to any quit-rent agreed upon; and the local customary right, which the peasantry of Malacca possessed, of taking up forest, waste or uncultivated land and acquiring a proprietary right over it by clearing and cultivating it, was taken away. Every land-holder was, however, declared to be entitled to add to his holding by engaging for contiguous uncultivated land in the proportion of one part of waste for every four parts of land cultivated by him.\n\nFinally, certain legal powers were given to officials to be appointed by the Governor, to make a survey of the lands of the Settlement, to require the attendance of parties and the production of documents, and to enquire into and decide questions of title, subject to an appeal to the Court of Judicature.\n\nIf this Act had been properly worked by a sufficient establishment, there would seem to be no reason why the Malacca Land Revenue Department should not be at the present time, as regards survey, settlement, maps, registration of holdings, and record of rights, on as satisfactory a footing as any settled district in an Indian province.\n\nBut no settlement operations on a sufficiently extended scale were ever undertaken. A surveyor was appointed and worked for some years during which time a tolerable survey of the coast districts (about one-fourth of the whole) was executed. The\nmaps so obtained were never published and the Indian system of declaring particular land to be liable for so much revenue annually, leviable quite irrespective of any title-deed delivered to the occupant, was not enforced by the Land Office, though this is distinctly what the Act aimed at. The officials of the day seem to have been still unable to get rid of the idea that the only way to make an occupant liable for land revenue was to make him sign a lease first of all.\n\nIn the words of the late Attorney-General of this Colony (Mr. T. Braddell, C.M.G.), whose paper on the Malacca Land History* has been of the greatest value to me in compiling these notes.\u2014\u201cthe cultivators, finding themselves better off under the Penghulus, with whom (when they had no written titles registered in the office, and followed by regular demands for the rent expressed in the title-deed) they were able to evade payment of the tenths, still refused to take titles, and continued to occupy old lands and to open up other lands with impunity, owing to the weakness of the Land Department, which was provided with so few, and such inefficient officers, that there was no regular supervision, and when any person was found encroaching on the Crown lands he was all ready with the excuse that the land was prescriptive tenant land.\u201d\u2020\n\nSystematic work in Malacca under Act XXVI of 1861 ceased with the departure of Surveyor-General Quinton from that Settlement, about 1867.\n\nA passing reference may here be made to Ordinance XI of 1876, intended to facilitate land-administration in Malacca, which has remained more or less a dead-letter for want of an efficient establishment.\u2021\n\nNeither Act XXVI of 1861, nor the Ordinance last quoted, touch on a subject which has attracted the attention of several persons who have written upon Malacca Lands. It has been stated above (p. 153) that owing to absence from the Settlement, or incapacity to contract, on the part of the persons entitled, the right of collecting the tenth was not redeemed.\n\n* Journ. Ind. Arch., N.S., I, 43.\n\u2020 Proceedings of the Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements, 1882, p. 68.\n\u2021 Id.\nby Government in all cases and that this right is still enjoyed by a few individuals in Malacca. Blundell speaks of the omission to carry out the redemption policy in these few instances (which of course ought to have been dealt with as soon as the exceptional circumstances alluded to ceased), as an \"important error,\" but describes the unredeemed lands as \"so small in extent (probably not one-tenth of the whole), \" and already (1848) so far occupied, as to preclude their being selected for any extensive cultivation\" by a new colonist prospecting for agricultural land.*\n\nThe plan proposed by Mr. W. R. Young, in 1838, of providing by a special Act for the resumption by the State of the privileges held by the few remaining tithe-impropriators, upon the award of compensation on an equitable principle, has not yet been acted upon. Perhaps the limited area of the land in question, which, he states, \"does not exceed in area four or five square miles,\" was thought to characterise the matter as one of not sufficient importance to demand special legislation in Calcutta. Mr. Young's remarks and recommendations are as follows:\u2014\n\n\"I must here mention that although the great bulk of the impropriators transferred their rights to the Government in 1828, a few of them were not included in Mr. Fullerton's arrangement, either by reason of the absence from Malacca of the principals, at the time of the negotiation, or because some of the tithe-owners had sub-let their privileges to others for a term of years, and the derivative interests thus created stood in the way of the admission of those impro priators into the scheme of adjustment. The land thus excluded from the general arrangement does not exceed in area four or five square miles, and I believe that the impro priators would be quite willing to surrender their privileges to the Government in consideration of receiving compensation on the principle which was applied to the cases of the other tithe-owners. I think it would be desirable, for the sake of uniformity, to extend the arrangement to these par tics, although the land in question is not sufficiently exten-\n\n* Journ. Ind. Arch., II, 743, 744.\n\u2020 Correspondence relating to the Land Revenue System of the Straits Settlements, 1837-1844, para. 40, p. 69.\nsive to offer any important obstruction to the satisfactory working of the new system as a whole. The position of the lands referred to, their limited area, and the facility of obtaining correct information respecting their produce and value, would obviate all risk of a recurrence, in relation to them, of the miscalculations or deceptions which have rendered the existing composition with the tithe-owners so bad a bargain to the State. If, however, these impropiators should be unwilling to assent to an equitable arrangement with the State for the surrender of their rights\u2014the terms of which might be settled by arbitrators\u2014and if Government should be of opinion that the retention, in hands of a few individuals of privileges, the reservation of which, even to the ruling authority, has been declared to be incompatible with the good of the country, would militate against the beneficial working of the new plan\u2014there would be neither injustice nor difficulty in providing by law for the transfer of those privileges to the State, with a view to the perfection of the commutation arrangement, compensation, on an equitable principle being of course awarded to the parties whose interests may be affected by the transfer. A measure of this sort would, I have no doubt, be acceptable to the tithe-payers, who will soon find themselves in a more unfavourable position than their neighbours who have assented to the commutation, and, indeed, there is little reason to suppose that the tithe-owners would object to a fair adjustment. Perhaps it would be advisable that Government should direct the local authorities to negotiate with the impropiators in question for the surrender of their rights to tithes, and to report the result for the approval or further instructions of the Supreme Government.\n\nA good deal has been said lately about \"British Malaya,\" under which term those who favour a policy of extending our territory on the Malay Peninsula, by annexation, would include the Straits Settlements, and at least those Native States which are now under our direct protectorate (Perak, Selangor and Sungei Ujong). A word, therefore, may here be added as to the lessons to be learnt from the history of the land-laws\napplied during the last sixty years to the only Malay State which has yet become British territory.\n\nIn Malacca, the native system of land tenure and revenue has never been properly ascertained and put into the shape of an Act. It has always been, therefore, and still is, more or less unworkable under English law.\n\nThe lands held under the native tenure at the time of cession were not identified and registered, and though a new system of tenure under English grants and leases was introduced, the old native system went on extending itself side by side with the new one.\n\nWhen, in 1861, it was declared to be the intention of Government to put a stop to the native system of acquiring a proprietary right by occupation, the holdings then existing were not ascertained by a visitation or survey.\n\nSo, though the native revenue system cannot be satisfactorily worked, for want of power to exact the tenth, the officials have been unable to oblige the people to adopt the English tenure, because lands, really only recently brought under cultivation, cannot always be proved not to be old holdings under the native tenure.\n\nThe experience of other British possessions in the East conclusively shews that the wisest way to organise the collection of land revenue in an Asiatic country is to adopt and extend the native system, to work it through responsible trained officers charged with the care of separate tracts and living in their districts, to create a revenue side of every District Officer's Court and to have nothing to do with English law.\n\nThis paper, which has grown to unexpected proportions, may now fitly end with a final quotation from an official report:\n\n\"It would be well if in the Protected States the history of Malacca tenures were taken as a warning, and if an early opportunity were taken of ascertaining the rights of native cultivators and land-holders and securing to them their full enjoyment, while laying down any modifications of the native law which may be decided on as to the future. If something of this kind is not done, the modern clearing will be undistinguishable from the ancient holding and land will continue to...\"\nMALAY LAND TENURE.\n\n\"be occupied and acquired on a system which it is difficult to assimilate with any satisfactory land revenue scheme.\"*\n\nW.

What Land may be appropriated and made the subject of Proprietary Right. Malacca Code.\n\nTo declare the law relating to upland clearings and paddy-land. Land for these purposes is of two kinds, the first is tanah hidop, (live land), and the second is tanah mati (dead land). Tanah mati is that on which there is no sign or token that it has been appropriated by any one, or any grove of fruit-trees in respect of which a proprietor can demand a payment. Regarding such land it is certain that there can be no question. If any person proceeds to plant upland or wet padi on such land, no one has any right to dispute it with him for it has been abandoned voluntarily by its former owner.\n\nLand which is known as tanah hidop is that which is appropriated by some one, either by living on it or by planting timber or fruit-trees or by laying out a garden or enclosure. This cannot be taken by anyone and is called tanah hidop. This rule applies also to persons who settle on the lands or plantations of others. As long as they live there, they must obey the orders of the owner, and if they oppose him, they may be fined ten tahils and one paha.* It is the duty of all the persons who live on the land to support and co-operate with their lord, a rule which is also laid down in the Hukum Kanun.\u2020\n\nIf a person plants an orchard (on the land of another) and his trees grow up successfully, and a complaint is lodged by the owner of the land, the value of the land shall be divided into three equal parts, one third shall be paid to the owner of the land, and\n\n* 1 tahil = $5.\n\u2020 A separate Code.

But according to another sound doctrine, the full value of the beast must be made good (by the crop-owner) and the value of the damaged crop must be made good by the owner of the beast.\n\n* \"The prevalence of this practice (the enclosure of cattle in fences), and the care with which fencing is universally attended to, is the best evidence of the value set upon land by a dense population. Their perception of the rights of property, and their desire to maintain and respect them, are amply attested by their many arrangements to restrain the trespass of cattle. On the other hand, one of the most serious annoyances with which the planters of the South have had to contend, both on their Coffee and Sugar Estates arises from the notorious indifference of the Kandyans and Singhalese in this particular, and their disregard of all precautions for securing their buffaloes and bullocks by day or by night.\" TENNETT'S \"Ceylon,\" II, 532.\nKa-dua tanam-an itu tiada ber-pagar jika di-tikam pada malam menyilih samua-nia yang ampunia tanam-an itu dan tiada-lah di-silih-nia uleh yang ampunia benatang akan tanam-an itu.\n\nJikalau siang ter-tikam sa-pulang-dua hukum-nia melain-kan jikalau sudah masahur jahat-nia kerbau itu sa-hingga menyilih sa-b\u00e9lah harga-nia jaga dan tanam-an itu di-silih pula uleh yang ampunia kerbau.\n\nPada menyata-kan hukum buah-buah-an di-dalam kam-pong orang atau di-dalam kota negri ada-pun jika tiada iya mem-bahagi-kan buah itu akan tuan-nia di-makan-nia ber-sama-sama jikalau di-jual-nia buah-nia itu maka di-pinta harga-nia sa-per-tiga dua bahagi pada ampunia kampong su-bahagi akan tuan-nia lama dan jika iya tiada mahu mem-b\u00e9ri maka marahi iya lalu di-tebang-nia pokok itu maka meng-adap ampunia pada hakim maka di-suroh hakim bayar harga-nia pokok itu bagai-mana \u2018adat sagala pokok kayu-kayu-an yang di-dalam kam-pong orang di-akan sagala buah-buah-an itu pun mana \u2018adat-nia yang sa-per-tiga juga dan jikalau di-jual-nia uleh ampunia kampong itu dapat di-d\u2019awa-nia uleh yang ampunia lama me-\nThe second kind of growing crop is that which is not fenced in. In the case of land of this kind, the value of a beast stabbed at night in the act of trespassing must be made good in full by the owner of the crop, and there is no obligation upon the owner of the beast to make good the value of the damage done by it.\n\nShould a beast be stabbed [trespassing] in daylight, the rule is that twice its value must be paid, except in the case of a notoriously vicious buffalo,* only one-half of the value of which need be paid, and the owner of which must make good the damage to the crop.\n\n[Superior and Inferior Rights. Malacca Code.]\n\nTo declare the law regarding the fruit of trees growing in the kampong of another or in the capital town, if the proprietor (of the trees) does not give a share of such fruit to the owner of the land, so that they may enjoy it in common, but on the contrary sells such fruit (for his own benefit), one-third of the value thereof may be demanded, that is to say, two shares go to the proprietor of the kampong and one share to the owner of the land. If the former will not give it, but in his anger cuts down the trees and the land-owner presents himself before the judge for redress, the judge must order the value of the trees to be paid in accordance with the customary price of all fruit-trees growing in the kampong of others, and in like manner fruit must be appraised, the above custom of dividing in thirds being observed, and if it is sold by the proprietor of the kampong the owner of the ancient right to the land has the right to sue.\n\n* Compare the rule of English law as to animals of a known vicious disposition.

Regarding the Bandahara and Chiefs, however, if one of them grants a kampong to a person and nothing is known of it by the Raja until the case of the cultivating-proprietor is represented to him, or if any Chief takes the kampong or dusun of any person and grants it to another and the proprietor represents the matter to the Raja and the Raja confirms the grant, the proprietor of the kampong has no further cause of action, for the thing has been done with the knowledge of the Raja. The end.\n\n[Hypothecation of Land. Recovery of Land, &c., wrongfully taken. Malacca Code.]\n\nTo declare the law regarding the hypothecation of dusuns (groves of fruit-trees). Now hypothecation is of two kinds, the first is harus (\"lawful\"), the second is ganda harus (\"lawful to double\").\n\nIf a man hypothecates a dusun (grove of fruit-trees) or a kampong planted with fruit-trees to the Raja, and the trees do not bear fruit while in the possession of the bailee during the whole time of his possession, even though he wait for years, the creditor may claim double his money.\n\nProperty in respect of which this doubling cannot take place is a grove of cocoa-nut or betel-nut or other similar trees. The law is that ganda does not apply to these, and should the creditor claim it, in-\nnian hukum-nia dan jika di-ganda-kan maka di-b\u00e9ri tahu ka-\npada hakim maka hakim-lah jadi lawan-nia jika iya men-dapat\nbarang sa-bagei-nia benda yang ghaib kapada kampong orang\nyang di-pegang-kan-nia itu di-bahagi sa-per-tiga \u2018adat dan\nsa-bahagi pada yang memegang gadei itu dua bahagi pada\nampunia kara-na lagi iya menunggu di-tampat itu dan dami-\nkian lagi kampong yang di-anugraha akan orang besar-besar\njikalau iya men-dapat sa-suatu pen-dapat-an di-bahagi dua pada\nyang ampunia sa-bahagi dan kapada yang men-dapat sa-\nbahagi damikian-lah hukum-nia ada-pun hukum dusun dua\nbahagi uleh sa\u2019orang yang tiada ber-hutang maka di-makan-\nnia buah-nia dan di-jual-nia maka datang tuan-nia buluh di-\nd\u2019a-wa-nia dan damikian lagi segala orang yang di-murka-i uleh\nraja-raja maka lari iya pada negri lain sebab takut-nia.

Apa-bila di-b\u00e9ri-nia uleh\nsa\u2019orang laki-laki di-buboh pada sa\u2019orang di-suroh-nia ber-\nformation may be given to the judge, who shall oppose it. If the creditor finds any concealed property of value upon the land of the debtor which is held by him in hypothecation, the custom is that it shall be divided in three equal shares, one of which shall go to the holder of the mortgaged land, and two to the proprietor, for the finding has taken place while the creditor is in possession of the land. The same principle applies to land bestowed by the Raja upon Chiefs. If anything is found thereon, it must be divided in two equal shares, one of which goes to the owner of the land and the other to the finder. This is the law.\n\nNow regarding dusun there are two regulations, first in the case of a man to whom no debt is due, but he nevertheless eats the fruit of the dusun and sells it; in such a case, if the owner appears, he has a right of action. So in the case of persons who have incurred the displeasure of their Rajas and flee to other countries out of fear for their safety, abandoning heir dusun or kampong, which are forthwith taken by others. In their case also, the rightful owners may sue in after days, for the property is theirs and shall certainly be restored to them by the judge. The end.\n\n[Sub-letting. A stated rent necessary. Perak Code].\n\nThe law regarding the renting of land. If land be made over by a man to another, the latter being put in to cultivate it on the condition that he receives\nPri hukum orang yang menyewa rumah maka apa-kala binasa dengan sa'suatu sabab-nia maka orang menyewa itu menyilih.\n\nJikalau handak di-binasa-kan per-janji-an maka di-pinta-nia-lah kambali akan sa-b\u00e9lah sewa-nia itu-umpama-nia sa'orang menyewa rumah janji-nia sa-puloh bulan sa-ratus timah maka di-diam-i-nia sa'bulan rumah itu runtoh atau binasa di-kira-kira-kan sa'bulan sa'puloh timah dan yang sambilan puloh itu di-pinta-nia-lah kambali.

But if the land be let out in consideration of gold, or silver, or food, the amount of which is determined, this is lawful.\n\n[Lease of House Property. House at risk of owner. Perak Code.]\n\nThe law affecting the tenants of houses. If the house is destroyed by the fault of the tenant he must make good its value.\n\nShould the tenant desire to put an end to the agreement, he may demand that a proportionate part of the rent shall be returned to him. For instance, a man rents a house on the undertaking that he shall pay one hundred catties of tin for ten months; he resides there for one month, and then the house falls down, or is otherwise destroyed; in this case, ten catties of tin must be allowed for the one month of occupation, and he may demand that the remaining ninety catties shall be returned to him. If he likes to continue to live in that house, he can call upon the owner to repair it for him, for he has paid in advance.\n\nThe case may be put, \"if the rent has not been paid beforehand what will the law be?\" The answer is, at the time that he refuses to live in the house any longer, he must pay rent for the term that has already expired; or if he still desires to go on living in the place, he may call on the owner to repair and must pay all rent which subsequently becomes due.\nPri hukum benda yang sakutu bumi dan sagala per-buat-an dan sagala pohon kayu meng-ikut bumi itu.\n\nBer-mula apa-bila di-jual-nia uleh sa'orang deri-pada dua itu akan benda yang sakutu itu kepada orang lain.

MALACCA LANDS.\n\nTuesday, 10th October, 1826.\n\nThe following European and Native Landed Proprietors were assembled this day at the Resident Councillor's Office for the purpose of enquiring into the particulars detailed below:\n\nB. De Wind, Esq.\nJ. B. Westerhout, Esq.\nG. Koek, Esq.\nA. Velge, Esq.\n\nThe Captain of Malays:\nAroom\nMahmat Tyre,\nLoerien,\nBooroe,\n\nInchis.\n\nM. de Souza was present by proxy in the person of his son.\n\nMessrs. De Wit, D. Koek, and G. de Souza, the Captain Kling and Dosso Bindasa were requested to attend, but unavoidable circumstances detained them elsewhere.\n\nThe above meeting took place for the purpose of ascertaining the nature of the agreement subsisting respectively between the Government, the landed proprietors, the Penghulus (or intermediate officers between the landed proprietors and the tenants), and the immediate cultivators of the soil.\n\n1.\u2014Between the Government and the landed proprietors.\n\nOn a reference to the records in the Registrar's Office, it would appear that some grants expressly state the right of Government to resume the land, and all, so far as the inquiry has gone, seem to indicate an ultimate right of this nature.\n\nThe grantee, by the records, is generally supposed to receive the land under an engagement of clearing the same of jungle, and the right of resumption on the part of Government would seem to arise from the non-fulfilment of this expressed or implied duty on the part of the grantee.\n\nIn regard to this clause, implied or seemingly understood in favour of Government, the present proprietors state that, without\nquestioning the absolute right of Government on this point, they consider themselves as possessing in equity a full and inviolate title to their grounds, inasmuch as the land has been sold to, and handed over during a series of years to various individuals without any mention being made of such inherent reservation affecting their title. On being required to produce their title deeds and grants, the present landed proprietors can only show Bills of Sale. They state that all sales or transfers of land were made in the Court of Justice, which body detained all previous papers and deeds on delivering up the last Bill of Sale or Transfer, and that the Court did not intimate to them the reservation above, to which it was their duty to do, if such a right be recognised on the part of Government.\n\nThe proprietors acknowledge that they consider themselves bound, on the requisition of Government, to keep in repair all established bridges and roads running through the grounds, and to clean the banks and body of the river bordering on their estates from nuisances. But that all new roads are to be constructed at the expense of Government, who can carry such roads through any part of an estate, after intimating their intention to the immediate proprietors of the soil.\n\nThe proprietors acknowledge also, that in cases of emergency (if any such should occur), they are bound to provide for the peace of their respective estates by embodying a police from among their tenants.\n\n2.\u2014Between the landed proprietors and the Penghulus.\n\nThe appointment of Penghulus is not obligatory, but is left to the free will of the proprietor, being solely for his own convenience. On small estates there may be no intermediate officer. On estates somewhat larger, but possessing a paucity of tenants, there may be a mata-mata, who, under a more modest designation, is de facto a Penghulu, both in power and privilege. On estates possessing 15 or 20 houses, there is usually a Penghulu appointed. On extensive estates, there are several Penghulus, one being generally appointed for each respective quarter of an estate, which may incorporate parcels of ground of different names.\n\nThe Penghulu and Mata-mata are exempted from any tax or assessment on their property, and are supposed to settle all disputes of minor importance subsisting among the tenants. But this is by simple compromise, as they possess no judicial powers. They pay regard to the tranquillity of the estate, and are the medium of communication between the landed proprietors and the tenants.\nThe Penghulus are not Government Officers in any sense of the term, and prior to the British authority receiving over Malacca on 9th April, 1825, Government did not, in any respect, interfere with them. Since that period, the Penghulus have been compelled to appear in Court, to take an oath for correctly exercising their authority.\n\n3.\u2014Between the landed proprietors and the tenants.\n\nThe tenant settles on an estate by the verbal permission of the proprietor. There is no express law as to the rate of rent payable, but the custom in general is for the landlord to receive 10 per cent. upon all the produce of the soil, although, in some particular instances, so low as 6 per cent. has been accepted by way of encouragement. When spices or pepper are to be planted, there is usually a separate and sometimes a written engagement made, and no tithe is levied for the first 3 or 4 years.\n\nDuring the Dutch administration, the inhabitants were not permitted to cultivate padi, and the produce of the estate consisted chiefly in fruits, wood and charcoal. Padi cultivation is however now extending in all parts. The tithe of padi, spices and pepper is usually received at the residence or stores of the cultivators, and in most cases this tithe is taken by estimation rather than by absolute measurement, which is found to be inconvenient. But the tithe of other articles is generally received in cash, after the same have been disposed of, and in case of apparent fraud, the sale must be traced, in order to ascertain the truth or error of such a suspicion. The land-holder possesses no right to establish his own mode of assessment or revenue, whether as to time, or place, or rate. In the collection of these tithes, some proprietors farm out their revenues, and others receive them through their own agents.\n\nA tenant may sell, transfer, devise, &c. the portions of land he may cultivate, and he is free to cultivate the soil to any extent. He may quit the estate at his free pleasure. But the land-holder cannot force him off the estate without just cause of offence. When this exists, a proper time must be granted to the tenant to enable him to dispose of his property.\n\nIf such tenant appears dilatory in effecting his arrangements, the land-holder may assemble the Penghulus and elderly people as a committee of appraisement, and the land-holder paying the amount according to their estimate, can oblige the tenant to quit the estate.\n\nIf the tenant feels aggrieved with the conduct or the judgment of the Penghulu, he is to apply to his landlord, and in all cases,\nwithout exception, where disputes or differences of opinion may subsist between the tenant and his landlord, which cannot otherwise be compromised, the appeal lies to Government.\n\nWednesday, 11th October, 1826.\n\nAs the nature of the landed tenures, so far as respects the relative right of Government and the landed proprietors, remains involved in some obscurity, the following order was issued, and it is believed that the question at issue will be satisfactorily elucidated when the Register required in this order may be completed.\n\nWith a view to ascertain the precise nature of the landed tenures, so as to complete the information which was yesterday elucidated at a meeting of the principal landed proprietors, the Dutch Translator is requested to examine the records in the office of the Registrar, who is to assist in the said enquiry, and extract from thence the particulars necessary to fill up an Abstract Registry of the following form:\n\nAbstract Registry of the Grants of Land made by Government from the earliest periods to the Inhabitants of Malacca.\n\n| No. | Date of Grant | Names of Grantees | Names and Extent of Land granted | Resumption by the Letter | Resumption not stated | Right of Resumption out of Letter | Dates and Impressions | Remarks |\n|-----|--------------|------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|---------|\n\nThe Land Surveyor will also draw up a draft of the Territory of Malacca, grounded upon the map in the Resident's office. In this draft, the Land Surveyor will trace, in double lines, the several divisions according to the original grants of Government and with Roman letters will refer to the foot of the map, or to an appended Schedule, exhibiting the dates of the original grants, names of the grantees, and other particulars as set forth in the Register to be completed by the Dutch Translator as above directed. The Land\nSurveyor will then trace off, with colours only, the present distribution of territory, using numbers, in lieu of Roman letters, for references as above.\n\nAs this Register and the map are to be submitted to the Hon'ble the Governor, the period of whose arrival is very uncertain, the Dutch Translator and Land Surveyor are requested to exercise such practicable expedition as may be compatible with a clear elucidation of the points in question.\n\nExtract from a Minute by Mr. Fullerton, Governor of the Straits Settlements, dated the 24th of November, 1827.\n\nAll the papers connected with Lands of Malacca being under preparation for transmission to Bengal, I now record a minute to accompany them, being an abstract of past transactions in that department.\n\nThe Lands of Malacca extend along the coast of the Malay Peninsula 39 miles, their greatest breadth inland, without including Naning, 28 miles, containing square miles 651, or acres 418,560. Of this, 500 square miles, or acres 320,000, are capable of wet rice cultivation, and of which 500 acres are now supplied to be actually cultivated. Of the dry lands, acres 10,000 may be supposed to be planted with fruit trees, or in gardens, acres 88,500 waste and covered with forest.\n\nThe whole of the lands appeared to have been assigned over to certain of the inhabitants nearly one hundred years ago. On first enquiry and examination of the deeds held by the present proprietors as they were called, descendants of the first grantees, the Government were led to view them as absolute proprietors and owners of the soil at full liberty to rent and derive the utmost advantage from them. On a further enquiry, however, and the examination of the Dutch records, it was found that only the Government right of levying from the resident inhabitants a tenth of the produce had been granted to them, and Proclamations were discovered interdicting, under heavy penalties, the demand of any rent or tax beyond the tenth of the produce. The persons thus investing with the Government right, it appeared, took little pains to encourage or extend the cultivation. Residing at Malacca and never quitting the town, the right of levying the tax was sold annually to certain Chinese inhabitants, who appear to have exercised over the inhabitants the right of compulsory labour and a\ndegree of power inconsistent with the improvement of the country. In reality, as the exercise of Police functions seems to have been a part of the tenure, the whole authority over the country rested with a few Chinese contractors. In order to open to Government the means of direct management of the lands with a view of encouraging and extending cultivation, as well as maintaining due control over the inhabitants, the redemption of the Government right to the tenth from the persons called proprietors presented itself as a most desirable measure. The collections having been rented, and the renters supposed to gain considerably, it was calculated that, by agreeing to pay to the proprietors a sum, even a little exceeding that received by them at present, little, if any, immediate loss would be sustained, and the Government would, besides the levy of the tenth on the lands actually occupied, be entitled to dispose of the waste and derive a growing revenue from the gradual extension of cultivation and increase of produce, to a portion of which they would be entitled. A settlement was accordingly made with the proprietors, whereby Government agree to pay annually according to the list. In consideration of which, the proprietors agreed to make over to Government all right derived from previous grants given by the preceding Government, surrendering all such as were in their possession.

The investigations requisite for the adjustment of the landed tenures at Malacca have, we are happy to see, been satisfactorily performed, and the adjustment itself completed. The following are the points which have been ascertained:\n\n1st.\u2014That the pecuniary claim of Government upon the soil, by the custom of the place, and of the neighbouring Malay States, amounted to one tenth of the produce.\n\n2ndly.\u2014That the persons called the proprietors, mostly Dutch colonists resident at Malacca, were merely persons to whom Government had granted out its tenth, and who had no other claims upon the produce, nor upon the occupiers, not founded in abuse.\n\n3rdly.\u2014That the occupiers, therefore, were the real proprietors of the soil.\n\n4thly.\u2014That the Panghooloos were merely the Agents of Government, or of the persons called the proprietors, for collecting the tenth share, and performing certain duties of the nature of Police, attached by custom to the proprietorship.\n\n157. We are extremely glad that you have been able to effect, with the body of proprietors, an arrangement whereby they make over to you the whole of their rights, for the fixed annual payment, about equal to the present amount of their annual receipts. You propose to manage the lands directly on account of Government, employing the Panghooloos as Collectors and Police Officers. They are probably the most efficient instruments whom, in the present state of society at Malacca, you have it in your power to employ. They will, however, require a vigilant superintendence, and the more so since the administration of justice, as at present organised, does not afford to the cultivators so accessible or expeditious a means of redress in case of their sustaining any injury, as to dispense with the necessity of other securities.\n\n158. You have reserved, as the privilege of Government, the absolute disposal of all lands hitherto unreclaimed, or which hereafter be suffered to run again into forest and remain unproductive for five years.\n\n159. The limits of all lands occupied by individuals are to be, as soon as possible, determined by survey, and defined by Grants duly issued and registered. All future transfers of landed proper-\nty are likewise to be registered; all these arrangements are highly proper.\n\n160. You have prepared a \"Regulation for declaring the rights of the Government over the lands within the territories of Malacca and providing for the due collection of the Government share of the produce thereof.\" This Regulation, consisting of thirteen paragraphs, you have transmitted for the sanction of the home authorities. We have already separately expressed to you our approbation of most of the arrangements to which this Ordinance is intended to give effect. We have now to add, that it is worded with remarkable clearness and precision and the rights of Government and of the occupiers are exactly and at the same time concisely defined. We, therefore, in conformity with the provisions of the Act 53 Geo. III Chap. 155, hereby sanction, with the approbation of the Commissioners for the Affairs of India, the draft as a Regulation which you have submitted to us, and of which we have already transcribed the title; and we direct this Regulation be promulgated and enforced, on the receipt of this despatch.\n\nA. M. BOND,\nAssistant Resident.\n\nExtract from a Minute by Mr. Fullerton, dated the 29th January, 1828.\n\nIn my minute of the 5th July, 1827, I entered into the consideration of the land tenures, but rather to record the apparent contradiction in terms or incompatibility of a supposed ownership of land with a right of levying no more than 10 per cent. of the produce, or without that of forbidding the occupancy of land except under such term as might be agreed on between parties. The main and express object of that minute was to excite further enquiries and draw forth further information on the subject apparently little understood. Mr. Lewis has now made a further report, and has submitted two documents out of the records which lend to throw much light on the whole subject. I allude to the order issued by the Dutch Government in the year 1819 referring to one of 1773. These documents render clear the terms and understanding under which the persons denominated proprietors hold their lands. It expressly interdicts and prohibits proprietors from levying as a tax from occupants of land\nmore than one-tenth of the produce. From this it appears that the Government of the day gave up to the proprietors, not the absolute right or ownership over the land, but only the Government right over it, that is, the tax of one-tenth of the produce. As far as I can trace from every enquiry, it appears that along the whole Eastern Coast of the Bay of Bengal from the commencement of the Burmese Territories to Point Romania, the right of the Sovereign is supposed to consist of one-tenth of the produce.* The ownership of the land is originally vested in the King, by whom it is made over to subordinate occupants to cultivate and render productive, on the term of yielding a tenth of the produce of every article.\u2020 The object of the late Government in assigning to the persons designated as proprietors the right of levying a tenth, probably was to make it the interest of certain individuals to introduce, encourage and extend the cultivation of the lands. In some deeds those terms are expressly mentioned. How far that object has been attained will best appear by the former report of Mr. Lewis. It appears by that report, that of 1,490 square miles, only acres 5,653 are in cultivation. It appears that so far from the persons called proprietors taking any pains to that purpose, they never even visit these estates; that they do not even themselves collect their tenth, but rent it in the mass once a year to a China contractor by public sale, who, having only one year's interest in the country, extracts from it the utmost he can, and it appears not only from the report of Mr. Lewis, but my own enquiries, that an excess is sometimes levied beyond the tenth, moreover that services are required, and labour exacted, from the tenants; in short they are kept in a state of vassalage and servitude quite inconsistent with the encouragement of cultivation. The right of levying the Government rent carries with it all the rent power of the State. That right vested in the Dutch proprietors, by them transferred in the mass to Chinese, has established a power and influence in that class too great even for the Officers of Government to hold in check. The advantages, therefore, that would result from the redemption of the rights of Government are too obvious to require further illustration. The present proprietors are stated to be willing to part with their privileges on certain terms and conditions. According to my idea.\n\n* I exclude that portion of the coast held by the Siamese Government. It is known that the Chief of Ligore takes in kind 40 per cent. of the produce, leaving to the cultivator bare subsistence.\n\n\u2020 Here then we find, as in many parts of India, two distinct rights:\u2014(1) The right to the Government tenth. (2) The right of occupancy vested in the subordinate tenant on their paying the tenth.\nthese should be settled on the principle of tendering them in the shape of an annual payment the full equivalent of which they now receive. That is to say, the proprietors should agree on their own behalf and that of their heirs to surrender and deliver up all rights, privileges and advantages, resulting from this present title, to Government, receiving in return a certain annual sum payable as long as the British Government shall remain in possession of Malacca. It might have been expedient to have awaited the orders of the Hon'ble Court of Directors before such a measure was carried into execution, but it appears to me that the case admits of no delay. Unless immediate advantage be taken of the disposition evinced by the proprietors to part with their titles, the object may be entirely defeated, for it is impossible to say what complicated rights may arise, and come into judicial decision which may oppose difficulties to future arrangement. It is clear that, by agreeing to pay a sum equivalent to the present amount of their receipts, or even something more\u2014the right being rented and a certain excess of profit, without reckoning undue exaction, must remain to the contractor, and which would, of course, be levied by the Officers of Government\u2014no loss could occur. In support of such an arrangement, and to induce consent to such, it may be pointed out to the proprietors that, by their tenures, they are bound to perform certain services, which, though neglected by the late Government, will be required under our administration; that in all old Grants the right of Government to impose a land tax is expressly reserved, is indeed inherent in every Government, and must, in all probability, be reverted to at no distant period, as it is not to be supposed that Government can be at the expense of affording efficient protection to the country without some contribution of the people, levied in all other countries for purpose of Government. The titles to many of the principal estates as they are called, I have reason to believe are of a very questionable nature, and if strictly scrutinised would be found probably very defective: they have on some occasions been acquired, and their limits extended by the exercise of private and undue influence rather than the sanction of public authority. The circumstance of their having been long in possession of the right, such as they are, is the main argument to induce the offer of pecuniary compensation for their redemption. Should the proprietors, as they are called, decline coming to terms, a strict investigation must take place; the terms expressly stipulated on those quoted in Mr. Lewis's last report, that is, the right of resumption must be exerted whenever they can be traced. The offer of paying an annual sum to the proprietor involves no admission of their claims.\nfor it must be understood that only on their accepting these terms we waive all enquiry. It would appear that many of the original title deeds lodged in the Office of the Court have been made away with, I entertain little doubt, by persons interested, and that the right of resumption and the provision for cultivating and improving them was inserted in all. Should the proprietors assent to the transfer, our course will be very clear; we shall then stand in their place in relation to the actual tenantry. The possession of the lands now occupied and cultivated must, of course, be ensured to them, that is, on the payment of the regular tenth and no more, due notice must be given them that all existing rights will be carefully preserved to them, that regular papers will be given to them specifying and defining the land attached to each, and securing possession to them and their heirs on the established terms. They must be told that they are relieved from all vassalage and feudal services whatever, that their labour is free, that in rendering the tenth of the produce, all pecuniary obligations due to the State are fulfilled, and that for every article required over and above, payment will be made. It must, however, be understood that the settlement to be made with the occupants will embrace only the lands actually cleared, occupied and cultivated; to all lands actually waste and forest the right of Government is reserved; for the gradual clearing of all such lands, arrangement must from time to time be made by the Officers of Government, and in this respect the known and established principle will be observed. That is, to grant cutting papers to such as may apply, to allow to the parties the occupation of the land free of any payment for a given number of years, after which to be liable to the payment of the established tenth or such other terms as Government may settle with the parties. In a country where the soil is particularly rich and fertile, the climate peculiarly favourable and healthy, where due care and attention exist towards the protection of the persons and property of the inhabitants, influx of population and great extension of cultivation may be reasonably expected.\n\nHaving made these observations respecting the lands, and proposed a certain course to be eventually pursued, the next point for consideration is the Police of the country. From the report of Mr. Garling above alluded to (of the 11th December), I infer generally that there exists no Police in the interior, that the authority of Government has never been established, that the few inhabitants occupying lands near our frontier are subjected to constant annoyance from the Chiefs and inhabitants beyond them; that the proprietors can neither collect their tenth, or even prevail\non any one to reside there. It appears from Mr. Lewis's report that certain persons under the Chief of Moar have been allowed to establish themselves within the boundaries known from time immemorial as the boundary of Malacca up to Mount Ophir; that this encroachment has been brought about by the aid and connivance of a Dutch proprietor, who was content to act as sub-renter of that Chief, who brought persons into Court to depose to points affecting the limits of the territory: thus, by a strange inconsistency, the sovereign rights of Government, determinable by them only in the Political Department, were brought into discussion in a Municipal Court, which had no jurisdiction whatever in the case.\n\nThe circumstance of a Dutch subject coming forward to infringe the limits of Dutch territory, affords proof of the singular power assumed by the individual, and the strange laxity and insufficiency of the Government to their own interest. It would appear indeed, from all I can learn, that the whole time Malacca remained under us, from 1795 to the end of 1818, the public authorities took but little interest in the affairs of the place. Holding it only for a time, the Dutch laws continued in force, and the Dutch Court of Justice was continued in operation, but instead of confining its powers to its proper duties\u2014the administration of Municipal Law\u2014the case before us shows that the Court in reality performed the functions of Government. I mention this subject now, in order to induce caution on the part of the public Officers in parting with the Records of the Dutch Court in Judicial Proceedings, since it seems evident they contain as much matter of Government as of Justice; the whole of the Records should, therefore, be kept as Government Records, the Officer of the Court of Judicature being allowed to inspect, examine and take copies when required.\n\nIn respect to the measure to be pursued in order to effect the removal of the persons from Moar, and the restoration of the integrity of our territory, I am of opinion a letter should be written to the Chief of Moar to recall them. If not attended to, the gunboat with a party of Sepoys and a careful person may be sent up to a proper position to insist on their removal, but I apprehend little fear of opposition to our wishes. In respect to Police generally, it may be observed that, so long as the present persons called Proprietors continue to levy their tenth, they must perform the reciprocal obligation imposed by their tenure of maintaining the peace of the country. In not performing that duty, they have entirely failed in their obligation to the State. Were the Government, therefore, now to maintain Police Establishments, it would only be to incur an expense which the proprietors ought to pay, and they should be distinctly informed that so long as they exercise the pro-\nper functions of Government in the collection of the tenth, deriving the profit thereby, they must perform the reciprocal duty. Another duty properly belonging to the proprietors is that of repairing roads, bridges, paths, &c.; this duty appears to have been much neglected; by all account the roads are by no means in the state they used to be, and ought to be in; the little labour that has been bestowed, I suspect to have been the forced labour of the inhabitants, extracted from them by the proprietors, and not paid for. Should the proprietors agree to part with their titles on reasonable terms, the establishment of a regular Police will not be a difficult matter. The enquiries I have made confirm me in the belief that the Panghooloos are the fittest instruments of Police, they appear to be the principal inhabitants of these villages or divisions. Their proper duty has indeed been to levy the tenth on account of the proprietor. When the proprietor puts his right up to outcry and sells to a Chinese contractor this duty seems to be done by the contractor himself, much to the prejudice of the people; the Panghooloo continues, however, to enjoy the immunities of his office\u2014exemption from the payment of the tithe. Two of the Panghooloos I met with at Ayer Panas, distinctly informed me that their fathers were the Panghooloos before them, and that they expected their sons to succeed them. I infer that by the custom of the country the office is hereditary in families, and I think the admission of such practice generally beneficial, as more likely to ensure good conduct and being consonant to the idea of the people.\n\nTo render the Police efficient throughout the country, it would only be necessary to appoint the Panghooloo the Superintendent of the Police, to use the European term, Constable of his division, to allow him one or more Peons, to explain to him his duties, they are in this case very simple\u2014to seize, and send in all persons breaking the peace or committing crimes and offences, and to execute orders from the superior Magisterial authorities of the country; other duties naturally present themselves\u2014that of keeping a correct list of all the inhabitants of his division, their characters and mode of life, requiring all newcomers and passers by to report themselves, allowing no person to settle without a register, or report to and license from superior authority. In their Revenue capacity, that is, as a servant of the proprietors, eventually of Government, his duty will be to collect the tenth, to report the state of the crops and of the general cultivation. The duties, if I may use the expression, of Revenue and Police are so blended, that they can best be performed by the same person. As to the argument that may be used in respect to abuse of powers, we must recollect that all power in human hands is liable to abuse, that abuse would probably be\ngreater, certainly not less, by the employment of a separate stipendiary establishment of strangers\u2014Chulias or Chinese. Abuse of power can only be prevented by constant local supervision of the Public Servants of Government, and whether the rights of Government are redeemed or left with proprietors, the occasional presence and inspection of Public Officers is indispensable. The expense of erecting a few bungalows in different parts of the country would be very trifling, and I propose that no time be lost in their commencement. They should be built at different directions, at intervals of from six to ten miles, and the roads between them made and kept in repair. To facilitate the means of communication is the first step to improvement and extension of cultivation. When ready means of access are afforded, when men find that they are alike secure at a distance from the town as they are on the spot, the lands then will be occupied and brought into cultivation, and it is only when that general protection shall have been fully established that we can expect Malacca to assume the appearance of a British Settlement. The communication between the Public Officers and the people should be at all times direct, free and unreserved. The interest of Government can never be separated from the prosperity, protection and happiness of the people. We can, therefore, have no object in deceit or concealment of our intention towards them, and from the knowledge possessed by Mr. Lewis of the language, habits and customs of the Malays in general, I am led to hope his endeavours will be successful in leading the inhabitants of the Malacca Territories fully to understand and duly to appreciate our views in regard to them.\n\nAPPENDIX III.\n\nCOURT OF JUDICATURE OF PRINCE OF WALES' ISLAND, SINGAPORE AND MALACCA.\n\nMalacca, the 7th day of March, 1829.\n\nBefore Sir John Thomas Claridge, Recorder, and Samuel Garling, Esquire, Resident Councillor.\n\n* At Nan'ing; at or about Tualang Hill; at or about Pangkalan Naning; at Ayer Panas; at half-distance; at the Pepper Plantation; at Supan Hill; at Garling Hill; at Lingy.\nAbdullatif v.

Benson Maxwell, C. J.\n\nMarch 17, 1870.\n\nSahrip v. Mitchell and Endain.\n\nTrespass. Meaning of the expression \"hold by prescription\" used in sec. 12 of Indian Act 16 of 1839, with respect to lands in Malacca.\n\n* Extracted from the Civil Court Book for Malacca, Vol. 1.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is an action of trespass. The petition contains two counts\u2014one for expelling the plaintiff from his land and preventing him from reaping the growing crop; the second, for breaking and entering into his dwelling house and expelling him from it, whereby he was prevented from carrying on his business, and was compelled to procure another dwelling. The first three pleas deny the trespass and the possession. The fourth alleges that the plaintiff, not being a cultivator or resident tenant holding by prescription, was, by a duly served notice, informed that the land in question had been assessed by Government from the 1st of January, 1870, at 97 cents per annum, and was therein also called upon by the Collector to take out proper title for the land, within a month from the date of the service of the notice, and that in default he would be ejected. The plea then avers that the plaintiff would neither comply with the terms of the notice, nor remove from the land within a month; and that the defendants, by the order of the Collector, and in the exercise of the powers given to him by Act 16 of 1839, assisted him in ejecting the plaintiff, which are the trespasses, &c.\n\nThe Act referred to authorises the Collector, by section 3, to eject persons in occupation of land otherwise than under a grant or title from Government, if they refuse to \"engage for or to remove from\" it within a month from the date on which they are called upon by him to enter into such engagement or to remove. But the last section of the Act excepts from its provisions \"such cultivators and resident tenants of Malacca as hold their lands by prescription, subject only to a payment of one-tenth part of the produce thereof, whether such payment be made in kind\" or in money.\n\nThe trespass was clearly proved; indeed, it was in substance admitted. It was proved or admitted that a notice in the terms stated in the fourth plea, signed by the Lieut.-Governor, had been served on the petitioner a month before, and that by that officer's orders, the defendant Mitchell, a Clerk in the Land Office, accompanied by another Clerk of the same Office, went in company with the other defendant, Endain, who is a Police Duffadar, three other Policemen, and an European Inspector, to the house of the plaintiff at about 11 A.M. on the 24th December. The Policemen were armed with swords, and one of the Europeans with a double-barrelled gun. The plaintiff was absent; but they turned his wife and family out of the house, and the furniture was removed from it by their orders. The garden and paddy land were also taken possession of; they were afterwards sold by auction by Mitchell; and the plaintif\nwas kept out of possession down to the present time. The plaintiff's wife made some imputations, in the course of her evidence, on the conduct of defendants and their comrades, in aggravation of the trespass, to the effect that her box had been broken open and some money taken from it, and that some of her furniture had been broken; and she also spoke of a threat to burn down the house if she did not leave it; but, as I stated yesterday at the close of the case, I did not think the imputations sufficiently borne out to be entitled to credit. They were denied by Mitchell; they were not corroborated, as they might have been, if true, by other testimony; and I had no evidence that any complaint had been made at the time, of the loss or destruction of the money or goods. A question arose in the course of the case, whether the Lieut.-Governor was a \"Collector\" within the meaning of the Act 16 of 1839, and another, whether the notice was in accordance with the 3rd section, as it did not require the plaintiff \"to engage for or remove from\" the land; but in the view which I take of the main question in the case, viz., whether the plaintiff is one of those \"cultivators or tenants holding by prescription,\" who are excepted from the provisions of the Act by the 12th section, it is not necessary that I should express any opinion on them.\n\nThe term \"prescription\" does not apply in English law, as Mr. Davidson justly observed, to land, but only to incorporeal hereditaments, such as rights of way, common or light; and if the term were construed in its strictly technical sense, it would find no application to cultivators of land. We had no statute of limitations in this country, relating to land, until 1859, and if \"prescription\" were to be understood as referring to a title to land acquired by long occupation, the section in question would find little or no application here, because the title acquired by the cultivators and tenants in Malacca does not depend on any statute or law of limitations. But there is another sense in which the term may have been used, viz., in the sense of \"custom,\" and in this sense it would make the section so widely and justly applicable to the circumstances of this Settlement that it appears to me beyond doubt that it is in this sense that the Legislature used it.\n\n\"Prescription,\" properly so called, is personal; it is the title acquired by long usage by a particular person and his ancestors, or the preceding owners of the estates in respect of which the right is so acquired. A \"custom\" is also established by long usage, but unlike prescription it is \"local\" not personal; when once established, it becomes the law of the place where it prevails, to the exclusion of the ordinary law; and those who have a right under it, have\nit, not because they and their ancestors or predecessors have long enjoyed it, as in the case of prescription, but simply because the custom of local law gives it to them, without any reference to the length of their enjoyment. In the case of prescription, long usage gives title to an individual; in the case of custom, long usage establishes the custom, and it is the custom, become law, which gives title to a class of persons in a locality, and gives it to them at once. The two things are essentially different, but there is a sufficient similarity or analogy between them\u2014usage being an element common to both\u2014to account for their being occasionally confounded; and I think it plain, from the history of the land tenure of Malacca, that it was in the sense of \"custom\" that the term \"prescription\" was used in the Act of 1839.\n\nIt is well known that by the old Malay law or custom of Malacca, while the Sovereign was the owner of the soil, every man had nevertheless the right to clear and occupy all forest and waste land, subject to the payment, to the Sovereign, of one-tenth of the produce of the land so taken. The trees which he planted, the houses which he built, and the remaining nine-tenths of the produce, were his property, which he could sell, or mortgage, or hand down to his children. If he abandoned the paddy land or fruit trees for three years, or his gambier or pepper plantations for a year, his rights ceased, and all reverted to the Sovereign. If, without deserting the land, he left it uncultivated longer than was usual or necessary, he was liable to ejectment. See Mr. Newbold's Work on the Straits of Malacca, vol. I, 160. It is clear that rights thus acquired are not prescriptive, in the technical sense of the term, but customary. They are acquired as soon as the land is occupied and reclaimed, and the title requires no lapse of time to perfect it.\n\nIt was contended by the Solicitor-General that such a custom was unreasonable and therefore invalid; but if such an objection could now be raised after its long recognition, as I shall presently show, I should not hesitate to hold that the custom was not only reasonable, but very well suited to any country like this, where the population is thin and the uncleared land is superabundant and of no value. It must be for the advantage of the State to attract settlers to lands which are worthless as forest and swamp, and thus to increase at once the population and the wealth of the country. A similar custom or law prevails in Sumatra. (Marsden's Sumatra, 224.) In Java, every Javanese has the right to occupy uncleared land, paying for it by giving the State his personal labour on road-making or similar public work, one day in five, or now, under the\nDutch, one day in seven; and though it might seem unreasonable in England that one person should acquire an indefeasible title to occupy the land of another by felling his forest and ploughing the land, I think that, in the circumstances of these countries, it is neither unreasonable nor impolitic for the sovereign power to offer such terms to persons willing to reclaim and cultivate its waste lands. But it is too late to question its reasonableness, after a long and continuous recognition, amounting virtually to an offer of forest land to all who chose to clear it, on the terms of the custom.\n\nThe Portuguese, while they held Malacca, and, after them, the Dutch, left the Malay custom or *lex non scripta* in force. That it was in force when this Settlement was ceded to the Crown appears to be beyond dispute; and that the cession left the law unaltered is equally plain on general principles. (Campbell v. Hall, Cowp. 204, 209.) It was held in this Court by Sir John Claridge, in 1829, to be then in full force*; and although it was decided by Sir B. Malkin\u2020 in conformity with what had been held in India, that the law of England had been introduced into the Settlement by the Charter which created the Supreme Court, it seems to me clear that the law so introduced would no more supersede the custom in question, than it supersedes local customs in England. Further, the custom has always been recognised by the Government; down to the present time tenths are collected, both in kind and in money, from the holders of land acquired under the custom; and from 1838 to 1853, commutations of the tenths into money payments were frequently made by deeds between the East India Company and the tenants, in which it was recited that the Company \"possessed the right of taking for the use of the Government 'one-tenth of the produce of all lands in the Settlement of Malacca.'\" The Malacca Land Act of 1831 plainly refers to and recognises the same customary tenure, when it \"declares\" that \"all cultivators and resident tenants of lands\" (the sovereign or quasi-manorial rights of which had been granted away by the Dutch Government) \"who hold their title by prescription, are, and shall be subject to the payment of one-tenth of the produce thereof to Government,\" either in kind or in money fixed in commutation.\n\nThat the 12th Section of the Act of 1839\u2021 would be justly ap-\n\n* See the case of Abdullah v. Mahomed Meera Lee, supra, p. xxxvii.\n\u2020 See Judgment of Sir B. H. Malkin; In the goods of Abdullah deceased.\u2014Morton's Decisions, p. 19.\n\u2021 Section 12 of Act XVI of 1839 is as follows:\u2014\"And it is hereby provided that nothing in this Act contained shall apply to such cultivators and resident tenants of Malacca as hold their lands by prescription, subject only to a payment to Government of one-tenth part of the produce thereof, whether such payment be made in kind or in the form of a sum of money received by the Government in commutation of the payment in kind.\"\nplicable to these customary tenants, can admit of little doubt, when it is considered that that Act made all persons, in general terms, holding lands in these Settlements otherwise than under Government grants, liable to assessment \"in such manner, at such rate, \"and under such conditions\" as the Collector, under instructions from Government, chose to impose; and authorised the Collector to eject all those who declined to \"engage for\" (that is, I suppose, to accept the terms of the Government), \"or remove from the land\" in their occupation. These provisions, suitable enough to new Settlements like Singapore and Penang, where neither custom nor even prescription had had time to spring up, could not, without manifest injustice, have been applied to persons in Malacca, who had already a good title to their land by the law or custom of the place; it was to be expected that provision should be made for excepting such a numerous and important class of persons from their operation, and it seems to me that provision was made for that purpose by the 12th section, the Legislature using the word \"prescription,\" not in its technical meaning, in which it would be insensible, having regard to the circumstances of the Settlement, but in the sense of local custom, usage or law, with which it is readily confounded.\n\nIf this be so, it is plain that the plaintiff was not liable to ejectment by the Collector for declining \"to take out the proper \"title\" for the land in his occupation, under the Act of 1839. It was forest and uncultivated land when he cleared it in 1829, and he paid tenths to the Government from that time until 1853, when he was appointed Penghulu. This appointment he held until 1868, and during his tenure of it he was, as is usual, exempted from payment. He was deprived of the appointment in 1868, and he paid tenths again in 1869. He is, therefore, plainly one of the customary tenants protected by the 12th section of the Act of 1839.\n\nThe only remaining question, then, is as to the damages. The plaintiff claims three hundred dollars. It seems to me that a serious wrong was done him, and that he sustained serious injury when he was expelled from his home and from his land. He had lived there for forty years, and I shall not conceal that I have some sympathy for the feelings of the Malay peasant, driven from his cottage, from the orchard which he planted and the field which he reclaimed\u2014from his home, in a word, and from the fruits of his labour\u2014because he would not give up his good title for one which he was not bound to accept, and nobody had the right to impose on him. But further, the injury was done by or under the orders of an officer, or officers, invested with certain powers, and under the colour of those\npowers; and I think that, when public officers set about exercising powers which necessarily inflict suffering or injury, or interfere with the rights or liberties of any person, they ought to be extremely cautious in what they do, or make their agents or subordinates do. Here, the defendants, acting on their own or their superiors' view of the law (it matters not which, as regards the plaintiff), committed a breach of the law, and a breach which might have resulted in a breach of the peace; for among the seven men engaged in the trespass, several were armed, and if the plaintiff had happened to be present, they might have encountered resistance; blood might have been shed, and the officers of the law would have had to answer for all the consequences of having been trespassers and wrong-doers. On the other hand, most of our native peasants, in the plaintiff's place, whether they resisted or yielded, at the time, to the display of force in the name of the law, would not have ventured, as the plaintiff has, to question its legality in a Court of Justice, and they would thus be permanently dispossessed contrary to law. For these reasons, I think it my duty to do what in me lies to discourage such proceedings; and, therefore, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, I shall give the plaintiff the amount of the damages which he has claimed.\n\nJudgment for the plaintiff for 300 dollars.\n\nAPPENDIX IV.\n\nPROCLAMATION.\n\nA complaint having been laid before the Court of Justice that the Captain Malayu, land-holder for Sungei Pootat and Batoo Brandam, has demanded from his tenants more than \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\) on the produce and also on sales or transfers of the property of cultivators,\n\nConsidering that it is against the rules and regulations of the place and opposed to the prosperity of the Settlement, we have found it advisable, in order to obviate this evil, to make known by proclamation that any one found guilty of exacting from any of his tenants a rent exceeding the tenth of the produce, will be\nfined 500 Rix dollars for such offence\u2014one-half of which will be given to the Churches and the other half to the Government.\n\n14th December, 1773.\n\nJOHN CRANS.\nG.

CASSA.\n\nPROCLAMATION.\n\nWe, John Samuel Timmerman Thyssen, Governor of Malacca and its Dependencies, to all to whom these Presents may come, send greeting:\n\nWhereas it has come to our knowledge that several covetous persons, proprietors of landed estates, have demanded from their tenants residing on their estates and possessing plantations, which through their industry have been brought to perfection, more than the fixed rate of ten per cent. on the produce of such plantations, and whereas it has also been represented to us that, on the transfer or sale of such plantations, the landed proprietors have demanded ten per cent. upon the amount realized for the same;\n\nAll of which, we consider to be an unwarrantable extortion, by which the prosperity of the Settlement and the interests of the industrious inhabitants, must in a great measure be affected;\n\nSo it is, that in order to obviate this evil, we direct the following to be promulgated:\n\n1st.\u2014That the proprietors of lands shall be satisfied to levy only a tenth upon the produce of their leased lands.\n\n2nd.\u2014That whenever money shall be paid by the tenants of their leased lands or plantations, instead of payment being made in kind, the landed proprietors must, in such cases, annually pass a contract in the presence of two witnesses, viz., the Penghooloo of the district, and the High Priest residing in the neighbourhood, who shall declare that none of the contracting parties have been compelled to enter into such an engagement.\nFurther, it shall be free to every tenant, after he has planted his ground with fruit trees, or cultivated it, to dispose of the same to another person, without paying to the land-holders the ten per cent.\n\nWe renew, against this extortion, the proclamation of the Governor and Director Jan Crans, bearing date 14th December, 1773, and enforce the penalty of 500 Rix dollars denounced in that publication against the transgressor of this order, the one half of which amount will go to the poor funds and the other to the informer.\n\nIt is understood by this, that in the event of a tenant wishing to dispose of his plantation, or transfer it to another, the land-holder shall have the preference on paying down the sum offered by another.\n\nAnd that no one may plead ignorance, this publication will be published in the Dutch, Portuguese, Malay and Chinese languages.\n\n20th May, 1819.\n\nAPPENDIX V.\n\nEVIDENCE OF TITLE.\n\nSPECIMENS OF DUTCH DOCUMENTS.\n\nI.\u2014\u201cPROPRIETOR\u2019S\u201d GRANT.\n\nGovert van Hoorn, Governor and Director of the Town and Fortress of Malacca, in the place of the late Inche Hollandia, Malay Translator and Writer of the East India Company, to whom the land of Battan Tiga, extending in length from Tanjong Broas to Cooleban Pekeneno* and in breadth on the north side extending to Bertam, was given for the good of this place, not only to cultivate it, but especially to settle it in order that no evil-minded or other disreputable people may have harbourage in the said land. Now as the said grantee is some time since dead; so it is that from a good mo\u2014\n\n*Klobang kechil.\ntive being a place well situated, and to prevent the Manicabows our enemies or other evil-minded men from annoying us which would be the case if they were permitted to take shelter in that place: It is therefore by this that we have again appointed as Head and Superintendent of the said place Battan Tiga, Inche Aron, who at present resides in the said place, and we further permit him to cultivate the aforesaid land, on condition that in the event a future Governor, our Successor, shall judge it necessary for the service of the East India Company to make any alteration in the buildings or the plantations on the said land, he must by all means acquiesce in such measures, without expecting to receive any remuneration for the same from the East India Company, on the other side. We promise at the request of Inche Aron to recommend to the favourable consideration of the succeeding Governor, our Successor, if his conduct should deserve the favour, to place his son Samsoodern in the next possession of the said piece of land in the event of his death or resignation of the charge, this we do in consideration of the loss of 900 Rix dollars sustained by Inche Aron, arising from the mortgage of the said land to him by his predecessor Inche Hollandia. The above land is, however, subject to all Government impositions and taxes which are at present in force or may hereafter be introduced.\n\n(Signed) G. van Hoorn.\n\nMalacca, 17th June, 1700.\n\nII.\u2014GRANTS OF TOWN LOTS.\n\nJan Crans, Governor and Director of this place and of the Fortress of Malacca and its whole jurisdiction, makes known.\n\nThat I have allowed and granted with the consent of the board of Administration of this place, as I allow, grant and make over by these presents, to the master of the Smith's shop, Mr. Omste, a piece of unoccupied and uncultivated ground, belonging to the East India Company, bordering upon the trench, to the East of this Fortress, between the points Amelia and Henrietta Louisa, broad in front along the road, six rods and three feet, course N.

J. E. TENISON-WOODS, F.G.S., F.L.S., &c.\n\nLECTURE I.\n\n17th April, 1884.\n\nI have here before me two pieces of stone. One, you observe, is a rough fragment of granite of irregular shape; the other is a rounded pebble such as you may pick up any day from the gravel of a running stream. If I ask how these stones came to have their respective appearance, few would hesitate for an answer. You would say that one has been roughly broken off from a rocky mass; and the other has been rounded in the bottom of a running stream. Yet, in these opinions, simple as they are and evidently borne out by the facts of the case, you have formed by the interpretation of the geological record. You have acted upon a principle which, if followed up, must lead to the interpretation of many of the geological features upon the earth's surface. You have deciphered one of the inscriptions which nature has written on the stones, that is to say, the record of the way in which its forces have been exercised.\n\nIn this respect, there is a close resemblance between the work of an Archaeologist or Antiquary and that of a Geologist. For example, the antiquary finds a stone, covered all over with inscriptions. This, he says, must have been done by a human hand. The man who has cut this has known the use of metals as well as writing. His people had arts, and thus he draws conclusions which no one will be found to dispute, which no one can dispute, as they obviously belong to the facts of the case, however much we may question theories built upon these facts.\n\nPrecisely in a similar manner we are able to draw conclusions from the inscriptions on the stones before us. The first is rough\nand its fractured edges show that it has been detached from a more massive rock by the exercise of some force. But I shall reserve for another occasion what I have to say about this piece of stone.\n\nThe second stone is water-worn. Whatever shape it had formerly, that shape has been modified by the action of a running stream. No other natural action gives to stones the peculiar smooth and rounded shape that this stone has. It has not, however, been produced by water alone. There has been also the grinding action of friction by one stone upon another. Running streams have their gravel in constant motion. By carrying away sand and lighter particles, the large stones are constantly shifting their position and rolling over. Then a flood comes, and the stones are pushed along and pounded against one another until the edges of the fragments have abraded and rounded. This process of hammering, breaking and washing is one that is constantly going on. It is more rapid of course and constant in swift deep streams. Irregular as it would seem, modern science has found means to measure it. By the use of the water telescope and by actual experiment, Mons. Daubree has learned much that formerly was, in this matter, mere conjecture. By means of revolving cylinders, he found that when pieces of granite are subjected to the kind of movement and friction met with in rivers, they are reduced to fine mud when they have traversed a distance of about 25 miles.\n\nOne word here about this granitic mud, which will form subsequently a subject of our enquiry. Though the change from a rough piece of granite to mere fine mud is very great, yet it is not so complete as to elude detection by the microscope. With the aid of this instrument, an expert can tell you at once that such mud has been derived from granite. He can not only tell you what kind of granite it was, but also whether it contained any metals. He can also say with certainty whether it was the action of the sea or rivers which reduced it to mud, and many other particulars which we shall find hereafter most useful in our present enquiries.\n\nIt may seem very unnecessary to spend so much time in explaining so simple a thing as the manner in which stones become water-worn. But obvious as it is, I think you will acknowledge its importance if you will bear with me a little longer. Simple also as it is, several important geological conclusions depend upon it; and in fact, like most simple things in nature, when closely observed, it serves to explain what is very complex. Thus, if you pay attention to the hills and mountains which surround the beautiful valleys near Thaipeng, you will notice features which this water-worn piece of stone will help you to explain. Our mountain\nrange has been rounded and moulded in a manner similar to all mountain ranges of its class on the earth's surface. The crest of the range rises and falls according to the projections of the rocks which are mostly bare on the summit. Weathering soon decomposes and rounds them, and the materials are swept to lower levels. From the crest buttresses descend; the drainage from which soon carves out deep valleys on the sides. On these lateral buttresses other valleys are cut down, and so on almost infinitely. The whole thing, however complex, represents one huge system of drainage. The great surface presented by the side of the range acts as an extensive condenser to the moist air from the sea. The water is ever rushing down back to the ocean, first in rivulets, then in torrents, and often, as an obstinate face of rock stops the water dashing over, in angry cascades. It is never at rest. Each day the process of wearing away goes on in thousands of rills and streams. But observe that it is not water alone which is doing the work. The sand and fragments of rock carried down by the water does the great work of scouring and cutting down the valleys, and the mountains are thus very slowly but surely worn away.\n\nAt one time in their history, probably these mountains were upheaved, but upheaval has little to do with their present form. The features which so many mountains share in common, point to some common cause for all, and this is what we call weathering, erosion or denudation. It is the effect of the friction of water and sand just as we see in the case of the water-worn pebble. So when you hold that pebble in your hand, you hold in miniature what the water is doing in the hills around you. Water is the universal solvent, and the law of gravity does the rest. Rocks are undermined and come tumbling down in landslips which fill up the valleys. Water pounces upon them here again and gives the stones no rest. They are worn away and carried to the sea, and the valley is scooped out again waiting for other supplies of material. Thus, gradually, main ridges become scarped and cut down by side valleys until they dwindle away. The materials are carried into plains which gradually build up islands and mud flats such as those which front the western side of the Malay Peninsula.\n\nThose who have visited the top of the range must have remarked how the crystals of felspar stand out from the surface of the granite just like pebbles in conglomerate. They often project an inch or more. Weathering has dissolved away the rock around them. Their crystalline structure and compact form enable them to resist decomposition, and thus they remain, for a time, as a\nrecord of what water has done.\n\nIf, then, the Thaipeng Range has thus assumed its present form by the action of water, we may assume that we have no means of knowing the extent to which it has been worn away. It certainly was higher than it is, and I shall show you what reason there is for believing that it was covered by other formations. But one thing we can certainly say. It has not been recently raised from the sea. Recent marine remains are entirely absent from it. I need not tell you perhaps that the sea never leaves doubtful signs of its presence where it has once been. Its infinite treasures of life leave millions of relics behind to mark the history of its stay. Nothing of the kind is seen here. Instead, we have layers of vegetable remains to mark what has been the former land surface and how it has supported only plant life.\n\nTo find out the geological history of these hills we must interrogate the only record that remains to us, that is, the material derived from the rocks, the drifts, sands and mud banks. This at first would not seem to be a very hopeful enquiry. But more evidence will be forthcoming from it than one would think. Daubr\u00e9e's experiments have shown that rocks are broken smaller and smaller by water until there comes a time when friction and abrasion have no longer any power. This is when they are reduced to fragments about one-fiftieth of an inch in diameter. Not only do they then cease to become broken, but the fragments do not readily become rounded or abraded at the edges. Such fragments are easily examined by microscopes of moderate power. By its aid the sand tells us its history. If it be from the sea, particles of lime and shell with other familiar remains soon tell its origin. If it were aerial or from a desert, every particle will be rounded, abraded and opaque. If from fresh water there will be carbonaceous matter and a peculiar sorting of the materials which I shall explain more fully.\n\nWith these facts as a guide, let us now examine the material which has come down to the plains from the mountains. Close to the hills we shall find boulders and heavy gravel. Their weight obviously prevents these materials from travelling far. Amongst the boulders some are angular, or just as they have rolled down from the hills, and some are rounded by water. Further out in the plain, we find alluvium and certain outliers of rocks which have as yet escaped denudation. These sometimes rise into detached hillocks, such as the Resident's Hill. Or they may scarcely rise above the surface at all, such as the red clays near the Thaipeng gaol. These clays are most important, and we shall consider them more\nattentively by and by. The rest of the plains are river drifts.\n\nWhen persons see only narrow streams crossing wide plains, they with difficulty understand how such rivulets could have formed such large areas of gravel, sand and earth. But the cause is quite adequate for the effects, if we remember the constant drainage from the sides of the mountains. It is unceasingly bringing down new material, which, as it accumulates, throws the stream backwards and forwards. No matter how distant certain portions of the plain may be, as soon as they become the lowest level, the water goes over to it and heaps it up.\n\nIt was the custom, long ago, to explain deposits of alluvium and gravel by theories of great inundations. But great inundations and convulsions of nature have a tendency to destroy and remove. The building up is done by the little stream which, like the busy bee, neatly spreads the materials. They may be called nature's chisels which carve and chip the stone, and nature's trowels which smooth and level everything.\n\nBear in mind again that the whole of the plains are not formed of alluvium. There were inequalities on the surface which are covered over by drift, but of unequal thickness. These, no doubt, were barriers to the waters until the drift rose up to them.\n\nBut not only does drainage level the materials. It sorts them as it carries them along. Lighter portions of granite sand, especially mica, are carried a long distance. Some metals also with light scaly ores, such as specular iron or titaniferous iron, are borne a long way. Heavy metals such as tin, gold and platinum, soon sink and remain behind.\n\nIn another lecture, I shall tell you more about granite, or the rough piece of stone with which we began this evening. But I want to say now that granite frequently contains metalliferous veins and crystals of oxide of tin scattered through it. This latter is a heavy mineral, and is never carried far from the hills. It is enclosed in granite, or at least mixed up with other rock, yet it is gradually sorted out and gathered together. The constant operations of water washes it and buries it in alluvial drift where it becomes stream tin. Vein tin, from its name, means tin ore occurring in lodes or veins, whence it has to be quarried from the solid rock. Vein tin, though in narrow lodes, goes down to great depths: stream tin is only a shallow deposit of fine ore spread over a wide surface. It is better ore and more accessible, but less permanent than vein tin.\n\nBut has all the alluvial drift of the Larut plains been derived from granite? I think not. I referred just now to the red clays.\nThese are stratified. If you examine those which are not far from the gaol, you will perceive in them a singular ribbon-like structure. There are lines varying between red, yellow, white and dark slaty blue. In some places, traces of quartz veins may be seen. The strata are twisted and crumpled into curves and folds. Now, I regard this as a very ancient formation, and which once probably covered the granite. The latter rock has been pushed through it, and this is why we find it principally at the base and the sides of the range. Probably the granite itself has been formed from this rock. It has been melted into its present crystalline form. But the clays contain more iron than the granite does. They have been much changed by their contact with the granite, and some portions of the formation have been converted into what geologists call \"gneiss.\" I fear I cannot explain these terms to you now in the time at my disposal.\n\nThere is one thing about these clays which must strike observers, and that is their fiery red colour. This is due to per-oxide of iron or rust of iron. In these countries such a rock is called \"laterite.\" Though the term is applied to many different kinds of rock, in fact any red stone or clay, I am now referring to only one kind, which is that derived from the paleozoic or ancient formation which lies above the granite. I wish to add also that, when not affected by much oxidation or rusting, these clays are blue instead of red.\n\nThese paleozoic clays give us a clue to the age of the tin. It tells us that the metal occurs here as it does in other parts of the world, that is, in connexion with the oldest granites. These paleozoic clays are probably Ordovician, or amongst the oldest of the stratified series known to geologists. Usually such clays or slates have been much altered by the changes to which they have been subjected in their long history.\n\nFrom the great extent in which these clays appear throughout the Malayan Peninsula we may conclude they once covered the whole of it before the granite burst through. But before this took place, the strata were much twisted and altered owing to heat, pressure and movements of the earth's crust.\n\nThere are excellent sections of this formation in the cliffs round New Harbour, Singapore, and again where the new road cuts through the hills on which Fort Palmer is built. The east face of Fort Canning also at Singapore shows an outcrop of the rock with regular strata dipping to the westward and a surprising variety of colouring. At Taiping Klang near Malacca the red rocks, more properly termed Limonite instead of Laterite\nhave been derived from similar rocks. I call them Ordovician, a term proposed for the Upper Cambian series, but I merely suggest this age as probable. They much resemble the Ordovician of Australia, though the precise age cannot as yet be proved.\n\nIt is probably under these clays, at their junction with the granite, the great deposits of tin ore took place. All mining geologists are aware, that when any metal is contained in a rock, it will be most abundant at the junction of that rock with another formation. I do not undertake to explain why it is so, but I merely state the fact. The junction of two formations is the locality where metallic deposits must be looked for. The whole of the granite in the peninsula contains tin, but it is at the junction of this granite with the paleozoic clays that the richest deposits of tin ore have taken place.\n\nThus the red clays become a good indication where tin sand may be looked for. But observe: it is not at this junction that mining takes place. It is when the clay has been washed away and the tin washed out of the junction; when it has been sifted and sorted by streams of water that the stream tin has been deposited where miners get it now. Not at the base of the clays, but in the drift which has been derived from the clays and the granite together.\n\nIt may be asked, therefore, whether it would be worth while to mine through the clays where they have not been denuded and look for tin at their junction with the granite. I think it would be worth trying. I do not think the tin sand would be likely to prove so rich as in drift where it has been subjected to ages of washing and puddling from the streams. Tin sand is found upon the clays throughout Thaipeng and the neighbouring hills. I cannot even give a guess at how thick these clays are, except that I do not think they can be very thick. I repeat that it would be worth while trying whether there is what miners term a second bottom.\n\nObserve also that I do not think that the tin deposits are merely confined to the junction of the granite with the paleozoic clays. The ore may be found at the junction of the granite with any rock. On the other side of the range, we seldom see these clays, but in place of them we have limestone and marble abutting on the granite. Here also tin is found and in great richness.\n\nSo, those who go prospecting may take the presence of such formations as a favourable indication, especially where there are high ranges near so as to secure the destruction and thorough washing of the overlying rock.\n\nIf any one asks why we do not find tin in such places as Singa-\npore, where the paleozoic clays and granite are found side by side, the answer is that there are no drifts. The reason of that is that there are no high mountains near to give rise to them. Small quantities of tin have been found at the junction of the clays and granite at Singapore, sufficient perhaps to justify the conclusion that had they been subjected to the action of running water and mountain streams for ages, large deposits of stream tin would have resulted.\n\nAt the same time, I do not suppose that all the granite at its junction with some overlying formation is equally rich. Generally it is rich. There are doubtless barren granites here as elsewhere, but they seem to be fewer here than elsewhere.\n\nIt is a remarkable fact in mining for tin that stream tin ore and mineral veins or lodes of tin are seldom found together. I say seldom, because I am not so sure about the experience of Europe, but I might say never, as far as experience teaches us in Australia and in this country. The richest tin lodes in Australia (Herberton) have no stream deposits anywhere near them. I should say that the causes which made the tin segregate into lodes were more energetic than those which condensed it loosely on the edges of an overlying formation. This, however, is theory. What my experience teaches me as certain is,\u2014first, that stream tin is not derived from lodes or veins; and secondly, that lodes or veins do not decompose into anything like stream tin.\n\nNow let us, in conclusion, examine the sections presented by the tin mines at Thaipeng, and see how far these will bear out those inferences. First of all, we meet with loamy clay or black vegetable mould, full of roots, branches, stumps of large trees in the positions in which they grew, besides prostrate stems of trees. Half of this black deposit is water, and half the remainder is vegetable matter that will burn. Underneath are layers of white, red and yellow sands, mixed with coarse layers of quartz and felspar. There are also occasional deposits of red clay.\n\nBy the aid of the microscope we find that the sand is derived from granite and deposited in fresh water. If you examine it closely, you will see that the grains are all angular and transparent. When the polariscope is applied to them, we find a magnificent play of colours. By the same instrument we are enabled to distinguish a few fragments of felspar and fewer still of mica. A little experience enables one to pronounce at once that this sand has come from granite. If it had been derived from a volcanic rock, the quartz would be glassy and not give the play of colours that we observe here.\nThe red clays, and probably the yellow clays, are derived from the paleozoic strata. The white clays may be decomposed felspar from which the sand is washed out. All this careful sorting and sifting has been effected by the force of gravity aided by the never failing streams of water from the hills.\n\nOccasionally, vegetable soil is again repeated, showing that there were different surfaces of dry land at different levels and at various times in the geological history of these deposits.\n\nThen appear more or less worn fragments of quartz, felspar, fluorspar, and granite. This may be called a gravel, but its material is sometimes a stratum of mere pebbles, or sometimes consisting of large boulders. These represent various vicissitudes in the history of the stream. When such water-worn stones are cemented together, the rock is called a conglomerate.\n\nUnderneath all these deposits, at a depth of 20 or 30 feet, we find the stream tin. It is usually in a gravel with much fine clay and coarse sand, which gives the stratum a grey speckled appearance. The depth of the tin stratum is variable, but seldom more than four feet, and often, in even rich mines, much less. The tin rests upon white or blue clay either paleozoic or derived from the granite.\n\nNow, when we find the tin sand all in one place and in the lowest stratum, we must conclude that it came there by the force of gravity, or that the upper part of the rocks from which the tin was derived was richer in tin than that which subsequently supplied the materials for the drift. Both these conclusions, I think, are partly true.\n\nThe drift overlying the tin may, in some case, have been removed and replaced many times by the running waters as they shifted their beds. Streams undermine their banks, they fall in, and are thus turned over, washed and re-washed and the heavier particles of tin soon become a stationary stratum in the lowest part. This is the history of a good deal of the tin deposits, but not of all. According to what has been already said, some portions of the materials for the drift were richer in tin than others, that is, the junction of the paleozoic clays with the granite rock. When these rocks were subjected to erosion, tin sand accumulated in much larger quantities.\n\nIf this explanation be correct, then we ought to find tin sand at different levels in different mines, and, as a matter of fact, we do. But in one group of mines there is generally a correspondence in the level of the tin in all parts of the field. Thus in Thaipeng it occupies nearly the lowest levels, from which we may infer that #\ngood deal of barren rock has been denuded since the rich beds at\nthe junction of the granite and clay have been washed away.\n\nTo some extent, tin sand may have gravitated through the\nloose watery sands even after they were deposited in beds. This\nactually occurs in thin strata of washed sand which is thrown out\nof the sluices. What little tin ore remains in this sand is found\nto have settled down to the bottom. But, of course, this could not\nhappen through coarse gravel or compact clay.\n\nAt the risk of being tedious, I must repeat the important les-\nson to be learned from these facts. The way in which tin sand is\nfound in rich deposits in certain parts only of the drift, shows that\nit has been the wearing away of some restricted portion of the\nrocks. This is at the junction of a formation overlying the granite.\nWherever, therefore, either from the out-crop of the rocks or the\nnature of the drift such a junction appears evident, deposits of\ntin may be looked for. Red clays are to be regarded as a special-\nly favourable indication, and so are out-crops of slate, schist or\nlimestone near granite. But an essential condition appears to be\nthat there should be high granite hills near, in order to secure the\nrequisite drainage for the formation of drift.\n\nI have mentioned how hollows in the ground affect the deposi-\ntion of tin. There are a good many depressions of the kind about\nthese mines, though the surface is even. The ground, as the miners\nsay, rises up, and the ore is almost absent from the slopes, while it\nis unusually rich in the hollows, those nearest the hills being the\nrichest.\n\nIt may be asked whether tin sand might be looked for at any\ngreat distance from the hills. To this a double answer may be\ngiven. The first is that tin sand usually does not travel far, even\nwhen it is very fine. A mile from its origin would be a long\ndistance.\n\nBut, secondly, tin may be looked for far out in the plains, be-\ncause it is certain that both paleozoic clays or granite in the form\nof outlying hillocks have existed there, though now they are was-\nhed away. In this case, the nature of the soil would be the best\nindication.\n\nThe manner in which the paleozoic clays are stratified, and how\nthe strata are turned and twisted and crossed by white veins, has\nsuggested to the author of \"Tim Mines in L\u00e2rut\" that there were\nfearful convulsions of nature going on when the stream tin was\ndeposited. But the cause of this dates much farther back. It\ndates to the period when the paleozoic were affected by the gra-\nnite, and crumpled or folded back by that rock.\nI have gone through most of the points connected with the geology of stream tin, especially as it refers to the State of Perak. You will doubtless be inclined to ask a question which I have not touched upon at all. This is, how the occurrence of tin ore in such quantities in clays or in granite is accounted for. This must form the subject of another lecture, for the story is a long one. It cannot be accounted for in as satisfactory a manner as the occurrence of tin in drift, but the matter is of the highest interest, as you will find, connected with the most attractive field of geological research.\n\nLet me say, in conclusion, that the connexion of stream tin with paleozoic rocks, limestone and granite is a most cheering part for the future mining prospect of this State. Such rocks are to be found everywhere; the valleys of the rivers are full of them. This makes me think that the tin deposits of the Malay Peninsula are the richest in the world, and that we are as yet only on the threshold of our discoveries.\nLECTURE II.\n\n21st April, 1884.\n\nOur enquiry in this lecture will be as to the way in which we can account for the rich deposits of tin ore in connexion with granite rocks.\n\nYou will remember how, in the first lecture, we began with the study of two pieces of stone, one of which was water-worn and the other a rough fragment of granite. The water-worn stone furnished us with a clue to the erosions of mountains and the formation of drift. We shall now turn to the rough stone to sift the question of its constituent parts, and we will begin our enquiry by asking: What is granite?\n\nBroadly defined, it is a compound rock consisting of quartz, felspar and mica. Quartz is a very hard glassy mineral consisting of the oxide of the element silicon. Felspar is a trifle less hard and more complex. It consists of, say roughly, 60 or 70 per cent. of quartz, a large percentage of alumina, and the rest made up of soda or potash, and a very little iron, lime and magnesia. Mica is a shiny glistering mineral, generally coloured yellow, blackish or transparent. It splits into thin flakes, and looks golden or silvery in some shades. Mica is a compound mineral, and contains, besides silica or soda, notably then silica, alumina and an alkali usually potash and magnesia, the latter being in smaller proportion than the former.\n\nNow observe that I am dealing with these things in the most commonest of ways. There are not only many different kinds of granite, but there are also various minerals. Granite does not contain any calcium or magnesium, but it has been mentioned that it contains both these elements. For my present purpose, however, I shall deal with granite in its simplest form.\nwhen it is melted and cooled, or slowly cooled if you will, becomes granite.\n\nBut against this theory we know many instances of the melting of the earth's surface by heat, and when cooled it becomes something very different from granite. Volcanoes emit from their craters the melted materials of the crust of the earth, but lava is not at all like granite, and even where it has cooled slowly it is still very different.\n\nHeat alone, then, will not suffice as a theory. A simple reflection will make us realize this better. Granite is in structure not unlike a piece of loaf sugar. But in the case of the sugar the structure is not due to mere heat, as I need not tell you. If you take the sugar and melt it over a fire, what a different material it becomes, and so it is with granite. If it be melted, which it requires an enormous heat to effect, the result, when cooled, is a mere slag.\n\nBesides, if granite be closely examined, a curious feature in the crystals will be noticed. The mica and the felspar have both left the forms of their crystals imbedded on the quartz. But the quartz cools at a much higher temperature than the mica or felspar. If heat alone had been in operation, the quartz should have cooled first and left its crystals to modify the other two minerals.\n\nBut for all that, geological research proved beyond a doubt that, melted or softened in some sort of way, granite had formerly been. At its junction with stratified rocks it was frequently found to throw out veins into fissures, and to be injected, so to speak, as a molten material could only be expected to do. Granite dykes or veins are not uncommon, and these sometimes in granite itself showing that the encasing material of which the walls of the dyke are formed had cooled or solidified to some extent before the latter was injected. When granite is found in contact with stratified rocks, the latter are usually much changed, and as if the crystalline rock had affected them by its heat. When this is not the case, it can generally be proved that there has been considerable displacement and upheaval since the granite was melted. The tilted stratified rocks which lie against it came to their present position in a later period in the geological history of both formations. Sometimes gradual transition from stratified rock to granite may be observed, so that it is difficult to say where one begins and the other ends, and even where the unaltered slates which lie near granite are submitted to microscopic examination. Occasionally in granite itself marks of former stratification can be made out. Blocks of evidently stratified rock are found imbedded\nin granite paste. But the most extraordinary thing of all is that fossils have been found in granite, much changed, of course, and crystalline, but perfectly recognizable. The Jura Belemnites in the Alps may be cited as an example, and I think I have met with paleozoic fossils in a granitic rock in Australia.\n\nAll this was very puzzling and gave rise to many theories. The facts seemed to hold the balance equally between a stratified rock on the one hand, and a kind of volcanic, or at any rate, an eruptive rock on the other. Then the theory of metamorphism began to make its way. This suggested the granite had originally been a stratified rock, and that it had been converted into its present form by the agency of heat.\n\nThis, you observe, only removed the difficulty one step further back. The question was still unsolved as to what kind of heat it was. Gradually the microscope was brought to bear upon the matter, and this, with chemical aids, brought what is now believed to be a full and satisfactory explanation.\n\nIf you subject a small rough fragment of granite to microscopic examination, you will not learn much. But if you grind down thin polished slices until they become quite transparent, you will be able to subject them to very high magnifying powers. Then you will see that the apparently solid crystals are full of minute cavities. Some of these are partly filled with water, others with gas, others again are cavities containing perfect crystals of such minerals as common salt, and other salts of magnesia, soda, &c. These crystals sometimes appear in fluid, which may be water, and they are in constant movement.\n\nIt would be an error, however, to suppose that these appearances are only found in granite crystals. They are seen, though not exactly in the same manner, in volcanic rocks, in meteoric stones and even in the slags of furnaces. But microscopic examination has shown immense differences between granites and those which have been certainly subjected to heat within reach of the earth's atmosphere.\n\nI cannot, in the limits of such a lecture as this, go into the details of this subject, but it will be sufficient to say that the progress of science, largely aided by the microscopic investigation of rocks, has shown us a most probable and sufficient cause for the metamorphism of granites. All the different effects of heat are found to vary according to the pressure at which they have been exercised.\n\nIt will save a great deal of explanation if I enter at once into the consideration of what must have been the geological his-\nNow we have examined the rocks, and the mass of heat has been extracted by the action of fire at first. There were considerable masses of water present, which was composed in part of sea water, and in part of water which was thrown away. The mass of water was so vast that it was found everywhere in the strata, and it was also found in the layers of the strata. The water was heated, and the heat was conducted through the strata until it had reached the surface. At this point, the heat was released, and the water was vaporized.\n\nNow, let us consider what would happen if we were to remove the heat from these rocks. If we were to remove the heat, we would be left with a mass of rock that was not heated. This mass of rock would then be able to cool down, and the heat would be lost by radiation.\n\nLet us turn our attention now to the effects of this heat on the materials with which it has to deal. Before these materials were heated, they were stratified. We can see this in many places where the masses of stratification have not been disturbed. There was a time, then, when these strata were laid down, line by line horizontally by the river or the sea or the aerial current from which they were deposited. They then consisted of sand, which means silica, of mud or clay, which means alumina, magnesia, lime, soda, potash, and a little oxide of iron. Fluorine and carbons, tin, gold or silver were also present infinitesimally. How they came to be present, I shall explain hereafter.\n\nBut there was one very important ingredient which we must not leave out, and that was water. All rocks contain this in a certain proportion. I do not mean those stores which come out as springs upon the surface, but water mingled with the ingredients of the rocks, that is, chemically combined. Gases of course there were,\nalso chemically combined, and also water in its simple form, mixed or soaked in we may say, and from which no compound rock is ever free.\n\nNow, consider the effect of heat caused by pressure on these materials aided by the presence of water. The latter material, you know, at the surface of the earth cannot be heated much above 212\u00b0 degrees of Fahrenheit. Then it evaporates in the form of steam. But under great pressure, of course it cannot evaporate. It may be then heated to any extent that the pressure will bear. Water, even cold water, is a solvent of rocks to a far greater extent than you would imagine, not only by wearing them away, but by really dissolving the stone. But at very high temperatures water acts on rocks such as quartz more powerfully than the strongest acid does upon iron at the earth's surface. Let us take dull red heat, for instance, and I will tell you presently why I choose that degree of heat. At this temperature, quartz would be readily dissolved by superheated water, while I need not tell you that it requires a considerably higher temperature to melt it in the air.\n\nThese conclusions are not the result of mere theory. Experiments have proved them. By means of carefully secured vessels, water has been raised to a red heat and even higher, and its action upon quartz, glass and many other substances observed. If I do not mistake, after an experiment which lasted some 18 months, some of the minerals of granite and something very like granite have been reproduced by Mons. Daubree.\n\nThis pressure, or the weight of the superincumbent rock, is quite sufficient to account for the change of stratified rock into granite. Pressure has generated heat, heat has brought into action the highly corrosive and solvent action of water, chemical action has been set up, those elements that have the greatest affinity for each other have united, acids have neutralised alkalies, gases have been liberated and made new combinations, and finally minerals have segregated, and the result is the rocks in the form in which we see them now.\n\nBe it remembered that though we class the rocks of this Range under one category, which we distinguish as granite, the rock is very varied in its constitution. It is fine grained, and coarse, blue and red, dark coloured and light. Some of it is almost all quartz and some foliated like a schist. Mica predominates in one place, and there are thick veins of felspar in another. All this is just what we should expect. The stratified rock was not of uniform character, but even if it were, the pressure would prevent the reduction of the whole into a rock of simple mineralogi-\ncal features. This fact must also explain the presence of metals in one portion and not in another.\n\nSome persons might find it difficult to understand how any interchange would go on under such pressure, but it will solve the difficulty to some extent when they are reminded that interchange and chemical action goes on in the hardest and most solid rocks. Solidity is a relative term. There is nothing on the earth so hard that a movement is not going on in its particles. The moving crystals in the cavities of granite prove this. Some think that light is the stimulus in this case. It may be so. That shows how even on the hard transparent diamond movement is continually going on, movement that is not more appreciable than the waves of light, yet movement and interchange for all that.\n\nI mentioned red heat just now, and I did so because certain geologists believe that this is the temperature to which granite has been raised. This is not a guess. It is founded on the known qualities of gases and steam. Their rate of expansion under heat and pressure is calculated in connexion with the cavities in granite. Some of these, it will be remembered, are half full of water, which has been steam. The amount of condensation furnishes a factor from which the former heat is estimated.\n\nAnother kind of proof as to the origin of granite is found in the sections of extinct volcanoes. A few instances are found which enable us to see down into the innermost recesses of these subterranean fiery lagoons. In the lowest depths where pressure of the overlying lava prevented the escape of steam, the rock is granite. In fact, the volcano itself is probably no more than the escape through an accidental fissure of some of that heat which pressure is causing below.\n\nWe must not, however, leave out of consideration one important condition in these operations, and that is the length of time through which they have been exercised. We have no standard by which to measure it. The period of history occupies only a few thousand years. Supposing the granite to have been seething and baking amid steam at a red heat for that time, we can well imagine surprising results. But probably nature's laboratory has been working for cycles in which the historical period is only a unit. What are the mutations observed in these granite hills as a work for such eternal ages? The silence and obscurity in their history is one of those mysterious chasms to the edge of which science has enabled us to climb, but where we can discern only a depth which is unfathomable.\n\nBut now to account for the presence of the tin in the granite,\nor rather in the strata from which the granite is formed. I am of opinion that it has been very finely, nay almost infinitesimally, divided through the rocks just as gold and silver is in the sea at the present day. Many people are not aware that these metals exist in solution in sea-water, but in so small a quantity, that tons of water must be evaporated before any appreciable quantity can be extracted. Now, it is quite certain that the precious metal is being deposited in the rocks forming on the sea-shore or at the sea-bottom at the present day. No doubt, immense quantities of this deposit would have to be reduced before even a trace of gold would be seen, yet the quantity is absolutely if not relatively great.\n\nBut what is not possible to man's chemistry is easily effected in the great laboratory of nature. If the present shore and sea deposits were subjected to such an action as that which reduced the ranges here to granite, we should have the gold in rich veins and shoots just as it is in the quartz veins in Australia. You may be inclined to say that the gold in Australia has been much more abundant than in the case I am supposing, but this is not so. It is estimated that more than five tons of quartz or vein-stuff has been operated upon for every ounce of gold extracted, which is considerably below the truth. This, however, be it less or more, is only a mere fraction of the rock metamorphosed from which this gold has been derived.\n\nThe whole process depends upon a peculiarity in the chemistry of minerals which is only imperfectly understood. This is a tendency to what we call segregation. Similar minerals seek each other out and run together. In the heavier metals when they are melted, one can understand it, but this occurs when the rocks or metals are not melted at all, where they are not particularly heavy, and where they take directions quite independent of the force of gravity. You will find veins of quartz and veins of felspar running through stratified rocks, you find lines of flints in chalk and septarian nodules in clay. If these things take place in solid rocks, every facility occurs for their occurrence in granite. Thus, in effect, we find in granite innumerable veins of quartz, felspar, iron ores, tin from seams of considerable thickness to the merest threads. They evidently do not depend upon cracks in the stone and could not have been injected in a fluid state. They have simply segregated and come together in that strange movement of particles to which the materials of the most solid rock are subject, by means of which they evidently travel long distance.\n\nNow, turning to the tin ore, we find it in the form of an oxide. Pay attention to this. Tin is easily melted. If it had been sub-\njected to mere heat, it would have run together in the form of pure metal as it does in the smelting furnace. But under heat pressure and with water, it is forced to combine with oxygen gas, a combination which is not easily effected without those conditions. Tin when kept at a red heat with free access of air, oxidizes readily. There are two forms of oxide of tin, one in which one volume of tin combines with one volume of oxygen, this is called the protoxide or stannous oxide obtained by chemical precipitation. It is a very unstable compound, and on slight application of red heat makes it burn like tinder and become stannic oxide. There is the second combination, or peroxide of tin, in which one volume of tin is combined with two of oxygen. This is the common ore of tin.\n\nIf heat alone had been concerned in the production of the tin which is found, it would have occurred in a different way. The peculiar oxide of tin, which is so familiar to you here, is a state of the mineral which can hardly be adequately explained, unless formed slowly. Crystals of Cassiterite may have been formed by the sole action of water just as crystals of silica are so formed. But the proximity of the granite renders the conclusion more probable that the agencies of heat, pressure and superheated steam have been all in operation in the production of this oxide of tin.\n\nUsually, the form of the fragments of Cassiterite in the drifts is not crystalline. You do find many crystals, but the majority of the grains are angular and amorphous. The edges are very clean and sharp, and not often manifesting any marks of abrasion. They resemble in this respect the fragments of quartz washed out of granite which are associated with them in the drift. From this I conclude that the tin has been amalgamated in the matrix or other rock paste just as quartz, felspar and mica are.\n\nI am rather diffident in propounding a theory as to how this may have occurred. Supposing, however, tin to have been finely disseminated through the formation which went to form the granite, it may have been sublimed and then condensed on the edges of the strata where the metamorphism was not complete. Thus it is found at the junction of the granite with the stratified rock. The use of the terms subliming and condensation may be a little misleading. I only use them as generally expressing the category to which the processes may have belonged. As a matter of course, they must have been different, because the conditions were different from anything which we can reduce to experiment.\n\nI am aware how unsatisfactory any theory is which cannot be brought to some test for its verification. In this matter, however, we must rest content with explanations which are little more than\nplausible guesses. In tracing back things like the metalliferous deposits to their true causes, we are still working very much in the dark. My object in this lecture has been to point out what is really known about metamorphism and to show how it bears upon the occurrence of such ores as Cassiterite. I hope I have at least succeeded so far as to give you a clear and simple exposition of the subject, and with this, I must rest satisfied and conclude my lecture.*\n\n*Note.\u2014Tin is found in drifts or alluvial deposits in Perak. Many think that it must have been derived from veins and that these will yet be found. The context of these lectures will show that I do not think so. The true matrix of the tin is in granite at its junction with the clays where it has been abundantly disseminated in fine and coarse grains. Nevertheless, in northern Perak there are tin veins or true lodes. Furthermore, I wish to place on record my opinion that the stream tin deposits of Perak are practically inexhaustible.\nR\u00c9MBAU.\n\nAs little has been recorded on the subject of this State, except in works not very accessible, and as I have visited it officially on several occasions, I have thought that a short account of the country may not be without some interest for the readers of this Journal.\n\nThis State is one of the countries known as the \"N\u00e9gri Sembilan,\" One of Nine States, formerly under a Yam Tuan (in full, Yang-di-p\u00e9r-tuan) B\u00e9sar and a Yam Tuan Muda, each, however, with its own chief or Dato' Penghulu.\n\nIn R\u00e9mbau, as in Nanning and others of the \"Nine States,\" a considerable portion of the population are M\u00e9nangk\u00e1bau by descent, and M\u00e9nangk\u00e1bau people still come over, as they do to Malacca.\n\nIts name is said to derive from an enormous M\u00e9rbau tree which used to grow in the plain near the foot of G\u00fanong Dato'; there are said to be some traces left of it still.\n\nAnother account states that the great tree fell down from the mountain, and that the name of the country arose from the description of the noise of the fall as the colossal stem thundered down the steeps\u2014\"m\u00e9rbau r\u00e9mbau.\"(1)\n\nIt is further related that so vast was the size of this giant of the jungle that its head reached to the Sungei Cjong(2) stream, to which it gave its name (i.e., Sungei Cjong K\u00e9yu M\u00e9rbau); while its branches extended to the Moar, and it has been pretended that from\n\n---\n\n(1) Probably a case of metathesis. This is likely enough to be the origin of the name; the other accounts are, of course, later embellishments.\n\n(2) This is the recognised official spelling, or I should spell it \"H\u00fajong\" in accordance with the proper Malay spelling, though Malays have begun to drop the \"h\" in this word, as in other similar ones, but I see no reason to drop it because it is mute. Many Malays still sound the \"h\" in \"htam\" and \"hayam,\" though the latter is more commonly sounded now without it.\nthis circumstance \"Merbau Saratus,\"(1) one of the limits of fishing rights on the Moar, took its name.\n\nRembau, like the rest of these countries, was, according to Mentra traditions, at first inhabited by the aboriginal tribes alone, and its first Penghulu was, like that of Naling, appointed by the Dato' Kelana Petra of Sungei Ujong.(2)\n\nAnother local version is that Rembau was first settled by Batin Bendihaara Sakudei at Hulu Remban near Gunong Dato', and he it was who felled the mighty Merbau tree. According to native authority quoted by Newbold, Bendihaara Sakudei was the first chief of Sungei Ujong upon whom the title Kelana Petra was conferred, and was the son of a Batin,(3) and the following account of this origin was related to Newbold by the Raja di Raja of Sungei Ujong:\n\n\"In ancient times one of the princesses(*) of Sungei Ujong having had the presumption to laugh at the naked state of a Batin of the Jakuns, incurred his resentment, and was compelled irresistibly to follow him through thicket and brake, until, moved with compassion, her 'sans-ecolotte ma\u00eetre de danse' broke the spell and married her. The offspring of this sylvan union is said to be Sakudei,(4) from whom descend the Penghulus of Sungei Ujong.\"\n\n\"Beduanda\" is the name of one of the chief aboriginal tribes in the South of the Peninsula, and two of the chief Rembau tribes bear the same name\u2014the Beduanda Jawa, and the Beduanda Jakun\u2014from which the Penghulu is alternately elected.\n\nThis alternate election is said to be due to a dispute in days\n\n---\n\n(1) The real origin of this name was probably that it was a very large tree, said to have 100 branches; cf. \"ringsa tajoh\" further down the Moar, which has seven stems branching from one root.\n\n(2) cf. infra with approval of Johor.\n\n(3) cf. infra.\n\n(4) The tradition, if the word \"princess\" is to be taken literally, is somewhat mixed (a not uncommon occurrence) about this, for there was no princely race in Sungei Ujong at the time; but it is a common practice to confer this title on women remarkable for beauty and fairness of complexion, and it may mean no more.\n\n(5) cf. with Rembau tradition infra, which makes him come from Johor.\ngone by between the two branches of the B\u00e9duada, each claiming the right to elect the Penghulu, which was settled by the sovereign of Johor giving each the right alternately.\n\nHe at the same time gave distinctive titles to the Penghulus\u2014to Titles. the one elected from the \"B\u00e9duada Jawa\" that of \"S\u00e9da Raja,\" to him of the \"B\u00e9duada Jakun\" that of \"L\u00e9la Maharaja.\"\n\nThe office is hereditary, descending on the side of the sister, as in N\u00e2ning and in all the M\u00e9nangkabau States. I attach a table shewing the constitution of the country, and giving an approximate estimate of the numbers of each tribe.\n\nIt will be noticed that the population is mixed.\n\nThe Siamese probably date from the time of the invasions by their ancestors recorded in the \"Scj\u00e1rah,\" and which, if we may believe that work, took place shortly before the Portuguese took Malacca.\n\nAceh and Malacca were at one time intimately connected, the latter, at first the superior, having subsequently become feudatory to the former.\n\nThe boundaries of Rembau with Malacca territory were defined by the Treaty of the 9th January, 1883, and were fixed as follows:\u2014\n\nKwila Sungai J\u00e9rneh,(1) Bukit B\u00e9rtam,(2) Bukit J\u00e9l\u00f4tong,(3) Bukit P\u00fatus,(4) Jirat Gunjei,(5) L\u00e1bok T\u00e1l\u00e1n,(6) D\u00fasun F\u00e9ringgi(7) D\u00e1sun K\u00e9par,(8) Cln Sungga, Bukit P\u00fatus.\n\n(1) \"J\u00e9rneh,\" clear.\n(2) \"B\u00e9rtam\" a palm-like reed, of which the leaves are used for thatch, and the stem split for walling houses.\n(3) \"J\u00e9l\u00f4tong,\" fine g\u00e9tah-bearing tree. The g\u00e9tah is mixed with other marketable g\u00e9tah.\n(4) \"Bukit P\u00fatus,\" cleft hill, a very common name all over the country.\n(5) \"Jirat,\" a grave; \"gunjei,\" a giant. This giant is said to have been so tall that he could pluck the coconuts as he walked along; he is said to have been killed at Pulang Ch\u00e1char (the plain of the ch\u00e1char tree) by introducing a spear head into a lambu in which water was given him to drink so that when he tipped it up to drink he swallowed the spear head, on which he fell, and was brought down by an insect in the leg; he fell and was buried where he fell, the heap over this marks the boundary point, where a pillar is now erected. There is another Jirat Gunjei in Tampin, said to be that of a female Gunjei.\n(6) \"L\u00e1bok,\" pool in a river; \"t\u00e1l\u00e1n,\" a tree (in other parts of the country called \"g\u00e1pis\").\n(7) \"F\u00e9ringgi\" Portuguese; \"d\u00fasun\" orchard.\n(8) \"K\u00e9par,\" a very peculiar stumpy kind of palm.\nThe R\u0113mbau branch of the Linggi from Sempang upwards forms the rest of the boundary line.\n\nThe boundary with Sungai Ujong was fixed about two years ago by His Excellency Sir F. A. Weld, as, previous to that time, there had been disputes about it. It now runs as follows:\u2014from Sempang to Bukit Mandi Angin, thence to Perhentian Tinggi, and thence to Gunong Angsi. The boundary on the inland side towards Sri Menanti, Inas or Jelei, and Johol has shifted from time to time, Gunong Pasir, which is now under Sri Menanti, is claimed as properly belonging to R\u0113mbau, though in Newbold's time it was said to have originally belonged to Johol, and this last is confirmed by the aborigines, who are the best authorities. The boundaries with Sri Menanti are said to be Gunong Tujoh, and Gunong Lipat Kajang.\n\nThose with Johol, Batu Gajah (on hill of that name), Gunong Dato', Perhentian Lantei (or Tinggi) on Bukit Clu Api-Api, and (including Tampin) Batu Berapit (now claimed to be in Tampin, Perhentian Manggis being said to be the right point, on Bukit Kuda Mati), Jeram Kambing and Bukit Putus.\n\nSempang, where the R\u0113mbau and Penar join to form the Linggi, and where we have now a Police Station on a small piece of land ceded to Government in 1874, was formerly one of the chief places in R\u0113mbau; Kwala Padas, a few miles further up on the right bank, was another, but they have both been abandoned. At Bandar Rasau was the residence of the Yam Tian Muda, and latterly of the late Penghulu Haji Saif. In Newbold's time the Penghulu lived at Chembong. The present Penghulu resides at Gemayun near Chengkau, where Haji Saif had another residence. R\u0113mbau, in proportion to its size, is, no doubt, the most populous of these native States, being probably about 11,000, exclusive of Tampin, Kru and Teibong; the details will be found in the table shewing the constitution of the country; in Newbold (1839) it is given at 9,000 including Tampin and Kru. The most populous part of the country is said to be inland at Sri Lemak and Clu Sopri, but this is not confirmed by the numbers I have obtained. From the table first alluded to, it will be seen of what a mixed character the population\nThey likewise bear, among the Malays, the character of being pre-eminently treacherous. The Gadong district (lying between our frontier and Gunong Dato') near which Haji Mastafa lives, is said to be the harbour of robbers and cattle-lifters, but Haji Mastafa is too far advanced in years, too imbecile, and too much in the hands of others to do anything to improve matters; but under the new r\u00e9gime we may in time look for amendment.\n\nAs Rembau used to be the place of installation of the Yam Tuan Rembau or Yang-di-pertuan Besar, it will not be out of place to deal here with the subject of the Yam Tuan. The original States in the interior of this part of the Peninsula, according to tradition, before they became \"Negri Sembilan\" were Kelang, Jelebu, Sungai Ujong and Johol, with seniority in the order given.\n\nThe \"Negri Sembilan\" are stated by Newbold, and probably correctly, as being originally as follows, Kelang, Jelebu, Sungai gri Sembilan Ujong, Johol, Segamat, Nanning, Rembau, Hulu Pahang (including Seri Pahang and Jempol) and Jelei (in Pahang, adjoining Jelebu). (1)\n\nKelang soon fell under the domination of Selangor.\n\nJohol originally included Jempol and the whole watershed of the Moar as far as the Palong on one side and Mount Ophir on the other, having on the N. & W. common boundaries with Jelebu, Sungai Ujong, Rembau and Nanning (the latter now included in Malacca).\n\nSegamat seems to have been absorbed by Johor a generation or two since. Nanning and Rembau were children of Sungai Ujong, and when the former of them came more directly under Dutch influence, Sri Menant, or more correctly Hulu Moar, which had asserted independence of Johor, took its place in the confederation.\n\nAbout the middle of last century, the Dutch, in conjunction with the sovereign of Johor, Sultan Abdul Jalil Shah, who was suzerain Origin of Yam Tuan Besar.\n\n(1) There is of course another Jelei also known as Inas, which, till a generation or two ago, formed part of Johol, nor is it clear that it is entirely separate now; this district could not have been one of the original \"Negri Sembilan;\" the title of its chief is the same as that of the Johol Dato', while that of the Jelei in the text was Maharaja Perba. No doubt with the decadence of the Johor dynasty, and the practical independence of Pahang, Jelei ceased to be regarded as anything but a dependency of the Bendahara.\nof the Nine States, appointed Daing Kamb\u014dja, a Bugis Prince, as their chief.\n\nHis rule, however, was not approved of, and the P\u0113ngh\u016blus of Sungei Ujong, Johol, R\u0113mbau and H\u0101lu Moar invited, with the assistance of the Dutch and the consent of Johor, the Princes of the M\u0113nangkabau dynasty to come over as their chiefs. Daing Kamb\u014dja, however, found support with some of the P\u0113ngh\u016blus, and for a time hostilities ensued between the rival parties, but in the end R\u0101ja M\u0113l\u0101war, the M\u0113nangkabau Prince, prevailed, and Daing Kamb\u014dja withdrew to Riau, where he died in 1773. Thenceforward Johor, by common consent, had nothing more to do with the N\u0113gri Sembilan.\n\nR\u0101ja M\u0113l\u0101war was then duly installed as Yang-di-p\u0113rtaan B\u0113sar by the four P\u0113ngh\u016blus of Sungei Ujong, Johol, R\u0113mbau and H\u0101lu Moar (who were styled the P\u0113ngh\u016blu B\u0113lantik from their office of installing the suzerainty in R\u0113mbau, which was thenceforth called \"T\u0101nah K\u0113rjan,\" i.e., the place where the business of installation is performed, not \"kar\u0101ja-an,\" so it is said.)\n\nThence the suzerain proceeded to Sri M\u0113nanti, his place of residence, so named from the chief and B\u0101tins there waiting to receive him in state, and it was called \"T\u0101nah M\u0113ngandong.\"(2)\n\nThe b\u0101leis erected for the suzerain on his visits to the different States were constructed of peculiar form, which must not be altered. That in Sungei Ujong was called \"B\u0101lei M\u0113lintang\" according to the best account, figuratively speaking from its P\u0113ngh\u016blu being in a position to oppose any innovations attempted by the Yam T\u016ban;(3) that in Johol \"B\u0101lei B\u0113rtingkat\" in the same way, being as it were, a third story on Sungei Ujong and R\u0113mbau, and being next door to Sri M\u0113nanti, would bring their representations right up to the Astana.\n\n---\n\n(1) I am disposed to think it was \"kar\u0101ja-an\" originally.\n(2) \"Kandong,\" to be with chief, in that sense to carry, to support, so this place bore or supported the Yam T\u016ban B\u0113sar.\n(3) Not, I am informed, as Newbold states, because it was built at right angles to the river. The allegorical explanation given in the text is more in accordance with Malay ideas.\nThe real power in these States is vested with the Penghulu, that Real power of the suzerain being nominal only. Newbold, from whose writings I have taken much of the account here given, states that, on the elevation of Raja Melawar to the office of Yang-di-pertuan, the following arrangement was agreed to between him and the Penghulus: that he should assemble them on affairs of State and submit to a majority; that his maintenance be furnished equally by the inhabitants of the four States, each house contributing annually a gan-tang of padi, two cocoa-nuts and one suku (i.e., 13\u00bd cts.).\n\nOn the occasion of a death, marriage, or circumcision in the Royal Family, each Penghulu was to send three buffaloes and to furnish a certain sum for distribution (probably for the benefit of the various officers who took part in the ceremonies).\n\nIn the case of a war also, the Penghulu was expected to come forward with a certain contribution of men, arms, ammunition, and provisions.\n\nThe Penghulu derived his revenue from his power of inflicting Penghulu's fines, and from contributions in kind made by the people of his State; he was said, too, to have the power, in other Malay countries reserved to the sovereign, of enforcing gratuitous labour, but I doubt if the power has been exercised, except to a very limited extent.(1) The respective positions of Yang-di-pertuan and Penghulu are also defined by the following verbal Menangkabau traditions:\n\nUndang-undang of the Negeri Sembilan(2)\n\n-Alum nen beraja, luhak nen berpenghulu, suku bertuha, anak biah beribu bapa.\n\nThe kingdom is under the Raja, the district under the Penghulu, the suku under the elder, and the members of the suku\n\n---\n\n(1) Such as helping in padi-planting and repairing the Penghulu's house and fence.\n(2) i.e., of the \"Perpatih\" (or perhaps more properly \"Pati\" Pthang) Sabatang, opposed to which is the \"adat temenggongan.\" I may refer to this in greater detail on a future occasion.\nunder the ibu bapa, (lit., father and mother) title of subordinate elder.\n\nSabingkah tanah terbalik, sa hilei urat kayu yang pitus undang yang punya.\nEvery clod of earth upturned, every slip of root snapped, is the Penghulu's.\n\nDeri hulu ayer menyencheng sampe kahitir ombak menechah, To' Bandar yang punya.\nFrom the trickling source of the stream to the mouth when the waves break is the To' Bandar's.\n\nDi pjak tanah, di langkah akar undang yang punya.\nAll the soil and roots under foot belong to the Penghulu.\n\nDi sauk ayer, di patah ranting sa champak golah di tepi tebing To' Bandar yang punya.\nAll water taken, or boughs broken within reach of a punting-pole from the banks, belong to the To' Bandar.\n\nAdat itu di anjak(1) ligu, di dith mati.\nNeglect of these customs will bring decay on the country, and if they are changed, destruction will result.\n\nAdapun Raja itu tidada mempinai nagi dan tidada bileh menchakei kharajat, melainkan berikaddilan sahaia serta permakananya duti sasiku, beras dua gantang, nior satali.\nNow the Raja does not own the country, nor can he levy taxes on its produce; but with him lies the final award of justice only, and he obtains a maintenance of a \"suku\" (12 cents), two gantangs(gallons) of rice and a string of (i.e., 2) coconuts. [A contribution from every householder.]\n\nKarna sasar ikan kablat sasar belat katibing.\nFor the fish (being pressed) rest against the weir and the weir is attached to the bank, (i.e., the Lembaga look to the Penghulu, and the Penghulu to the Raja).\n\nJika runtoh tebing, bindasa lah belat.\nIf the bank gives way the weir is destroyed (i.e., if the Raja is without justice, the Penghulu is undang-less, and the four\n\n(1) v.l. \"di chabu.\"\ns\u016bkus are without their Lembaga, the waris get no inheritance, and the country is destroyed).\n\nThe following table gives a view of the Yang-di-pertahans Besar Table of and Muda from the time of their first introduction to 1832, from Tams. which it will be seen that up to the time of Raja Ali's appearance on the scene, the Yang-di-pertahans came over regularly from Menangkabau. He was called in by the Rembau people to help in the conduct of hostilities against Yam Tuan Muda Raja Asil, and his son Raja Haji, who had given offence by a marriage that was considered unlawful.\n\n(From Menangkabau.)

And on the decease of a L\u0113la Maharaja P\u0113ngh\u016blu the Dato' M\u0113rah Bangsa discharges similar functions.\n\nThe four Lembaga in the low country are held senior to the four inland, and when one of the former dies, his insignia are half those displayed on the death of a P\u0113ngh\u016blu, while those of an inland\nchief are slightly less; money, for instance, is not scattered on the way, nor are cloths spread on the path. The story of the origin of Dato' G\u00ebmpa, Dato' P\u00e9rba, and Dato' P\u00f9thi is as follows: There was a chief named Dato'(1) B\u00ebndah\u00e0ra Sak\u00fadei(2) (his wife was a Jakun, daughter of Batin Saribu Jaya, she was called Princess Long-hair), who came from Johor with his followers to open R\u00ebmbau. After him came a man from M\u00ebnangk\u00e0bau named Dato' L\u00ebteh, and he and his party became trusted to the Dato' B\u00ebndah\u00e0ra, and supported the people from Johor: they all settled at a place called K\u00ebbun L\u00e1da (Pepper Garden). After a time B\u00ebndah\u00e0ra Sak\u00fadei had three children (female) the eldest named Dato' Bungkal, the next Dato' M\u00fbdek, and the youngest Dato' M\u00ebngk\u00f9du. Later on he removed to Sungei \u00dajong, but he left his eldest child Dato' Bungkal in R\u00ebmbau with Dato' L\u00ebteh. Dato' L\u00ebteh belonged to the Mandiling branch of the B\u00e1tu Hampar S\u00e0ku, and at the time all those of the B\u00e1tu Hampar S\u00e0ku who came over from M\u00ebnangk\u00e0bau to R\u00ebmbau put themselves under him.\n\nThere were five branches of the B\u00e1tu Hampar S\u00e0ku from M\u00ebnangk\u00e0bau who adhered to Dato' L\u00ebteh, viz., the Mandiling, the Ch\u00ebni\u00e0ga, the P\u00e0ya Bid\u00e0ra, the Pagar Chinchang, and the Agam.\n\nIn course of time Dato' L\u00ebteh looked round for a suitable husband for the daughter of the B\u00ebndah\u00e0ra, and while he was considering the matter, there came a M\u00ebnangk\u00e0bau man of the Ch\u00ebni\u00e0ga branch of the B\u00e1tu Hampar S\u00e0ku named Dato' L\u00ebla B\u00e1lang, to ask for Dato' Bungkal as a wife; all the family were agreed to it, and they were married.\n\nIn due course Dato' L\u00ebla B\u00e1lang became father of a son, whom he named L\u00ebla Mahar\u00e0ja.\n\nWhen he was about six years old, and the country had become populous, Dato' L\u00ebteh consulted with Dato' L\u00ebla B\u00e1lang, and suggested that it would be advisable for the latter to go to Johor and make over the country, for it belonged to the Dato' B\u00ebndah\u00e0ra.\n\n(1) The account quoted supra calls him a Batin, which would imply that he was himself a Jakun. The title of B\u00ebndah\u00e0ra is now in use amongst the Jakuns.\n(2) Probably because he came from the river of that name in Johor.\n(Sakudei), the two Dato' thought that no one else could rule the country but L\u00e9la Maharaja, for he was the grandson of the Dato' B\u00e9ndah\u00e1ra.\n\nThen Dato' L\u00e9la B\u00e1lang went with Dato' Laut D\u00e1lam who was a M\u00e9nangkabau man with a Javanese wife, to Johor and there the son of Dato' L\u00e9la B\u00e1lang was appointed P\u00e9nghulu L\u00e9la Maharaja, but while he was in his minority Dato' L\u00e9la B\u00e1lang undertook the duties, and was given the title of Dato' G\u00e9mpa Maharaja.\n\nThen came Dato' Laut D\u00e1lam complaining to Dato' L\u00e9la B\u00e1lang that he had obtained the P\u00e9nghuluship for his son and the administration of it for himself with a title, while he, Dato' Laut D\u00e1lam had got nothing for his trouble (the journey to Johor?). Then Dato' L\u00e9la B\u00e1lang returned to the presence the same day and represented the state of matters. The R\u00e1ja asked whether Dato' Laut D\u00e1lam had any daughters, and finding he had, decided that when he grew up L\u00e9la Maharaja should marry Dato' Laut D\u00e1lam's daughter, and if he got a child, that child should be P\u00e9nghulu S\u00e9dia R\u00e1ja, whose duties should be undertaken by Dato' Laut D\u00e1lam, and Dato' Laut D\u00e1lam had the title of Dato' M\u00e9rah Bangsa conferred on him. They then returned to R\u00e9mbau. (*)\n\nIt was subsequently decided, in consultation with Dato' L\u00e9teh, that all the Ch\u00e9ni\u00e1ga branch of the B\u00e1tu Hampar S\u00faku should be handed over to the charge of the Dato' G\u00e9mpa Maharaja, i.e., Dato' L\u00e9la B\u00e1lang. The other four branches of the s\u00faku remained under Dato' L\u00e9teh, who was Dato' P\u00fatih, and have so continued to this day.\n\nThe descendants of Dato' Laut D\u00e1lam became the \"waris\" of the P\u00e9nghulu S\u00e9dia R\u00e1ja, because of the mother having been Javanese, and when the \"waris\" of both P\u00e9nghulus had become numerous, an elder was put over them with the name of Dato' P\u00e9rb\u00e1, who was chosen alternately from each side, being at one time Jakun and the next J\u00e1wa.\n\nDato' P\u00fatih has always been considered to be connected with the\n\n(* This and the other States were no doubt at the time of the taking of Malacca by the Portuguese inhabited by aborigines only. These latter assisted in the defence of Malacca with their primitive weapons.\nDato' Perba up to the present time, because Dato' Letch brought up Dato' Bungkal, and Dato' Pitih is descended from Dato' Letch, and Dato' Perba is descended from Dato' Bungkal.\n\nThe following account is given of the origin of the name \"Lima Suku\" in the low country:\n\nIn the time of Penghulu Kasir a woman of the Dato' Perba's Origin people was taken to wife by a man of the Mungkar tribe in Tampin, but his people did not pay the marriage dowry. On this the Dato' Perba and Dato' Pitih after consultation summoned their people together and went to Tampin to demand the dowry; they kept up the attack for about a fortnight, but without success; then Dato' Pitih and Dato' Perba called to their aid Dato' Maharaja Sinaru, Dato' Lea Angsa, and Dato' Ganti Maharaja; these three agreed to help them in the affair they were engaged in, and assembled all their people and attacked Tampin, which was defeated at their first attempt; the Mungkar people admitted the dowry claim, and the matter was settled. Then the five Dato' returned to Rembau, and there they agreed to act together always, and they had a feast and slaughtered buffaloes, and Penghulu Kasir removed to a place called Masjid Batu Pitih, where there was a great assembly and the five chiefs mentioned registered an oath with the spilling (1) of blood and under the Koran, that they would remain five elders with one Lembuga, each with his own people, but of one mind, whether advantage or injury should accrue, they should share it as long as the sun and moon, which cannot change, endure. Whichever of the five chiefs should change or depart from the above solemn agreement, he would be punished by the testimony of the thirty books of the Koran, the Majesty of Pagar Ruyong would fall upon him, and the weapon Kiwi would make an end of him. This was the origin of the five sukus, and thenceforth Dato' Penghulu Kasir spoke of the four and five sukus, in the low country, with respect to the \"berampat berlima suku,\" and the \"berampat bersembilan suku\" inland. It is said that the first settling of this First settlement \"rat,\" i.e., finger into the blood and conveys it to his mouth.\n\n(1) Each party puts some of his blood into a cup, and then each dips his\npart of the country was agreed on by three chiefs from M\u00e9nangkabau; one Dato' Lut of P\u00e2ya Kumboh (1) selected a stream called L\u00e2yang; from him Dato' Si Mahar\u00e2ja (2) is descended; another Dato' P\u00e2tih from Sri Lemak took the stream called L\u00e2bok R\u00e2sa; from him is descended Dato' Sinda Mahar\u00e2ja;(3) another Dato' Inda P\u00eatr\u00e2, a man of B\u00e2tu Balang took the stream of Bintongan; he was the ancestor of Dato' Andika.(4)\n\nThese three all began planting in the places named. They claimed from the sources of the streams to their junction with the main stream. While engaged in clearing, they heard the sound of many trees falling down stream within the range of their claims, on going to see the cause, they found one Dato' P\u00e2tih K\u00eap\u00e2la a Sri Melenggang man of M\u00e9nangkabau occupied in clearing. (Dato' Mand\u00ealika (5) descends from him.) The place was called B\u00e2tu Hampar. Then there was a dispute between the three chiefs and Dato' P\u00e2tih K\u00eap\u00e2la, the former claiming from the gullies to the mouths of their streams, saying they had settled there first; the latter claimed the same, and their claims were equally strong, for they had been all recognised from Johor. Later on authority came from the Penghulu dividing the land between them, and making the boundary from B\u00e2tu Menunggul to Tunggal Merbau in the B\u00e2tu Besar jungle, and thence to Tunggal Ch\u00e2char, on to Kw\u00e2la Anak Ayer Hitam in the S\u00eapri stream; whoever went up the Leng stream must be under Dato' Si Mahar\u00e2ja, whoever went up the L\u00e2bok R\u00e2sa stream must be under Dato' Sinda Mahar\u00e2ja, and any one settling up the Bintongan stream must be under Dato' Andika. So the Tiga B\u00e2tu people under Nang Besar, who went up the Bintongan, were under the jurisdiction of Dato' Andika. So likewise in the case of the S\u00eapri, Dato' Penghulu Uban brought two men from Johor, Dato' Chindei Laatan (a B\u00e9duna, from whom descends Dato' S\u00eatir Mahar\u00e2ja), and a M\u00e9nangkabau man of the P\u00e2ya Bid\u00e2ra branch of the B\u00e2tu Hampar, (from whom Sutan B\u00ebndah\u00e2ra is descended), and told them to settle on the S\u00eapri. They worked\n\n(1) Name of a rush-like grass growing in swampy ground.\n(2) Lembaga \"di-darat.\"\nwith the three chiefs, Dato' Si Maharaja, Dato' Sinda Maharaja, and Dato' Andika, and they became five s\u016bkus, and were called \"b\u0113rampat berlima s\u016bku\" being confined within the boundaries above-mentioned.\n\nFurther down stream came Dato' Mengiang of the Mungkar s\u016bku from Machap,(1) and a Menangkabau man, i.e., Dato' Maharaja Inda, making three with Dato' Putih Kepala, i.e., Dato' Mandolika, and these were called three elders and one Lembaga.\n\nThe origin of the appellation \"b\u0113rasambilan\" is that they descended from nine mothers in these three s\u016bkus, four in the Sri Melenggang, three in the Mungkar, in the Tanah Datar(2) two; these worked together, together bore disgrace and shame.\n\nThe eight Lembaga of s\u016bkus, four in the low country and four inland, hold the next position in the State to the Penghulu, and in all affairs of consequence he is obliged to consult them and to follow the opinion of the majority, and no treaties or agreements affecting the country generally are valid without their signature. The four Orang Besar, though not heads of s\u016bkus, still, from their position as \"waris\" and consequent eligibility for the Penghulu-ship, are able to exercise considerable influence. But subordinate chiefs of intriguing character are, of course, often found to have an influence greatly disproportionate to their official position. The Dato' Perba, the foremost of the \"duablas s\u016bku,\" also occupies an influential position, from his being the head of the joint s\u016bku of Beduanda Jakun and Beduanda Jawa, from which he, like the Penghulu, is alternately elected. He is also eligible for the Penghulu-ship. It will also be noticed that his s\u016bku is by far the most numerous, being double any of the others.\n\nThe soil of Rembau resembles that of Nanning generally. The same may be said of its physical configuration; the country is of country an undulating character, the depressions being mostly \"sawah,\" and the rising ground kampongs or secondary jungle. The hills, except near the Malacca frontier, seem to be of less elevation than in Nanning. Bukit Besar is the only mountain in the country, exclu-\n\n(1) In Nanning.\n(2) Datar, i.e. flat.\nThe \"sawah\" or padi-fields are extensive, but a good deal is now out of cultivation, owing to the fatal cattle disease which has raged during the last three years, and has carried off almost all the buffaloes. I saw very few indeed.\n\nA large proportion of the \"sawah\" have, however, been planted out with padi this season, the fields having been prepared by means of a large wooden \"changkul\" or hoe, which is much used by the Rembauans.\n\nThe \"sawah\" divisions (\"jalor\" or \"p\u00e9tak\") strike me as being a good deal smaller than those in our territory, probably owing to the fact that they are cultivated by hand, and the \"batas\" or dividing ridges appear much better kept.\n\nThe soil of the \"sawah\" is of a lighter colour than is common in Malacca and there is more tendency to sand and quartz grit in it.\n\nThe yield appears to be high, averaging eighty to ninety, and in some places runs as high as a hundred-fold. At Gadong I noticed the \"sawah\" soil was a very white clay with an admixture of grit, and was told it was particularly good and produced a hundred-fold. In this, as in other Malay countries, a certain amount of \"ladang,\" or high-land cultivation, of padi takes place, more particularly when circumstances are unfavourable for the \"sawah\" or wet cultivation.\n\nThere is no tin worked in Rembau, though it was acknowledged that it existed, but was not worked for fear of the water flowing from the workings poisoning the \"sawah\" and preventing the cultivation of padi. At Ulu Pidas tin has been worked, but I heard it had been given up owing to rival claims.\n\nGranite is the prevailing rock, but quartz occasionally appears cropping up to a limited extent, and loose fragments are found in the streams. The soil on the mountains of Tampin and Dato' is good, of light brown, occasionally clayey. The variety of ferns on Gunung Dato' was considerable. The Tampin soil is said to be richer than any in Malacca, except that in the Machap district.\nPadi-la:\n\nIrope.\n\nAVC\n\nin.\n\nprevailing\n\nek.\nTHE TAWARAN AND PUTATAN RIVERS,\nNORTH BORNEO.\n\nThe following sketch of these two rivers, taken from the notes of a trip which the writer had the pleasure of undertaking recently in the company of Mr. A. H. Everett, known for his researches into the ornithology of the Philippines, do not claim to be more than a cursory survey, but may contain some elements of interest, as treating of two rivers that have remained practically unvisited since the respective visits of Mr. Burnidge, the botanist, on his journey to Kina Balu, and of the present Sir Spenser St. John, in one of his numerous exploring expeditions.\n\nThe Tawaran river is reported to take its rise in the mountains flanking the great mountain of Kina Balu to the South. An affluent of it, however, called by the local Dusuns the Sungai Damit, which flows into the main stream on its true right bank at a point some few miles away from the sea, is said by them to flow more from the North of East, and may, therefore, be surmised to take its rise from the western flank of the big mountain. The mouth of the Tawaran opens to the westward, and is partly closed by the invariable sandy bar which obstructs the entrances of all the rivers of this part of Borneo.\n\nStarting from the island of Gaya, where the North Borneo Company have a station, our route lay across the bay of that name, past the mouth of the Meuggatal, or Kabatuan river, which, debouching to the westward, has good anchorage in deep water off its mouth, to a landing place called Ganifsan situate in the bight of Sapangar bay, where formerly the vil-\nlage of Gantisan stood. A low neck of land separates Sapan-\ngar bay at this point from the adjacent basin of the Karimbunai river. Coal is reported by the natives at this point. The water supply is good, and there is secure anchorage close inshore protected from both monsoons. A very slight cutting would suffice to pierce this narrow collar, and would thus render Gantisan, the natural outlet of the trade of the Karimbunai, Mengkabong and Tawaran rivers. The soil of the whole of this dividing ridge is apparently lateritic sandstone.\n\nDescending into the valley of the Karimbunai river, a short walk down its left bank brought us to the village of that name; the headquarters of Pang\u00e9ran Raja, the Governor of the district, a feudatory of the Sultan of Brunei and a member of the former Brunei royal family. On examining an outcrop of the strata on the river bank, the strike proved to be N.E. with a dip of about $80^\\circ$ bed rock sandstone. After an interview with the old Pang\u00e9ran, a boat was procured in which we paddled down to the common mouth of the Karimbunai and Mengkabong rivers. This is remarkably narrow and would seem to have been contracted by the formation of a high sandbank which has been, and is being, pushed southwards by the influence of the north-east monsoon and of the heavy swell from the China Sea, the action of the opposing monsoon being greatly neutralized by the protection afforded by the projecting bluff of Gaya head to the south-westward. The entrance is said to be fairly deep, but would probably be impracticable in heavy nor'westerly winds. Paddling up the broad expanse of the Mengkabong river, our course, on the average, being about E. by N., we came upon some fine reaches of water. Numerous channels branched off from the main one, which was flanked to the northward by mangrove growth, and to the south and east by grassy hills, while a bold range towered up to the S.E. A few miles further brought us to a point at which the river expands into a large, lake-like sheet of water, from the upper end of which a perfect network of broad channels diverge, dotted in all directions with Bajau villages extending far away up to the foot of the mountains.\n\n* Eight feet or so.\nThe entire population of this district is Bajau, and is supported mainly by fishing; a little hill paddy being grown as well.\n\nThe Mengkabong \"river,\" so called, bears evidences of having been originally an inlet of the sea dotted with sandstone islands, which have, for the most part, become connected by the rising of the land and by the silting up of the basin itself, the blocking up of the mouth of which, by sand-bars, has led to its assuming its present form. In general features, it much resembles the Sulaman basin, no great distance to the north of it.\n\nAfter threading this watery labyrinth for some hours we penetrated a narrow channel and landed at its head, at a small kampung called Brungis, whence a walk of about an hour over a low ridge, and then across a broad plain, brought us to the banks of the swiftly flowing Tawaran river, which at this point is a fine stream rolling its turgid yellow flood along between sandy banks of medium height. The Tawaran here intersects a level plain of large extent and sandy soil, dotted with homesteads surrounded by plantations of cocoa-nuts, and here and there under paddy cultivation. This plain is bounded by the sea to the W., by the mountains of the upper Tawaran to the E., and to the S. by the low ridge mentioned above, which divides the respective water-sheds of the Tawaran and the Mengkabong. On the northern bank the plain apparently extends to the foot of the mountains separating the Tawaran from the Sulaman basin. Our route from Brungis lay East, East by North and then North, and the portion of the plain traversed had a general fall towards the East of North, but a very slight one.\n\nOn striking the river, our course lay upstream for some considerable distance, at first over level ground, and then, when the limits of the plain had been reached, and the true valley of the Tawaran entered, along the steep flanks of hills abutting on the stream, where a false step would often have precipitated one into the flood below. Fields of paddy, groves of cocoa-nut trees, herds of buffaloes, together with pigs, goats and poultry, betokened a well-to-do and prosperous population. Sugar-cane appeared to thrive, but the specimens seen were\nnot well planted and were short in the staple. Some of the Dusun homesteads dotted about this Tawaran plain possessed quite a home-like air of tranquillity and repose about them. Nestling in the grateful shade of cocoa-nut groves, bowered in broad-leaved bananas, and girdled with green paddy fields, they had a pleasant look to the tired traveller's eye. Snowy paddy birds dotted the verdant pastures, huge adjutant birds flew on lazy wing from point to point. The scene was not without its idyllic charms, nor were home-associations wanting in the familiar-sounding caw of the Bornean crow (Corvus validus) as it was borne to the ear on the breeze.\n\nThe district towards the mouth of the Tawaran is called the Timbalang country, and has a Bajau colony settled in it. Above this point the Dusun population prevails, though a Bajau house may be found here and there. The tribal designation of the Tawaran Dusuns is Latud, and it may here be mentioned that that of the Dusuns up the Tampassuk river further north, is Timat; that of the Dusuns in the vicinity of the North Borneo Company's Station of Kudat, on the north coast, Memagun (vide the late Mr. F. Witt); while that of the Dusuns up the Labuk river, on the east coast, is Tambena.\n\nReaching at sunset the house of a Bajau named Ibu, who had settled down there and had taken a Tawaran Dusun maiden to wife, we put up for the night, our slumbers soothed by the potent influence of some tuak, or cocoa-nut toddy, pressed upon us by the proprietor of a neighbouring Dusun house. This district we were told was called Telibong.\n\nAn early start on the morrow down the bank of the river, brought us to the village of Liong Liougan, the Tawaran at our starting point flowing from N.E. with a rapid current. The bed rock of this region is sandstone. Proceeding some distance further down stream we accomplished a perilous transit in a gobong, or dug-out canoe of the very slenderest dimensions. C'\u00e9tait un mauvais quart d'heure, for neither of us could swim, and the river, swollen by flood water, resembled a boiling, eddying Maelstrom, but fortune was kind, and on safely reaching the right bank, a short walk brought us to the Sungai Damit, which we struck a few hundred yards above\nits confluence with the main river. The Sungai Damit is a deep, sluggish stream shut in by high muddy banks. Here we halted at the house of the Datu Bandara and Tumonggong\u2014a large, long structure of the ordinary Dusun barn-like type. A sago extracting apparatus was set up on the river bank here, in which product a moderate trade exists there. I had, en route, noticed cocoa-nut and areca palms, bananas, keladi, and paddy in profusion. The country is in fact very prosperous, in despite of the ravages of the memorable flood of January, 1833, which was very destructive in the Tawaran district.\n\nFrom the Datu Tumonggong's conversation, it appeared that a tamu, or market, was held at a place two days' journey up the Sungai Damit, to which the people of Kiau\u2014the village on the flanks of Kina Balu, visited by Messrs. BURBIDGE and SPENSER ST. JOHN at different times\u2014came down to trade. The route was, however, at present closed, owing to a blood-feud.\n\nReturning in the afternoon to Iau's house, we started, after a light repast, for Tempeluri, a village some distance up the Tawaran, reaching the house of a Datu Massudi at about 3 p.m. The Tawaran is here a fine rapid stream, bordered on its true right bank by wooded hills, and on its left by level ground well planted with cocoa-nuts, with paddy fields beyond, bounded by hills in the back-ground. The height of the river rendering it impossible for us to proceed to Bawang or Lokob, we returned to our head-quarters in Iau's house at the foot of the hill of Tagerangan, after a tramp altogether some 15 miles or more. In the evening a native of Kiau, named Bungarian, arrived. This man, in the course of conversation, declared that no man had ever yet reached the true summit of Kina Balu, which, he asserted, is inaccessible from every side when once a certain elevation has been reached, the remainder of the ascent being sheer precipice. He added that there is a Dusun legend to the effect that a deep lake exists on the top. This is probably only a deduction on their part, drawn from the existence of perennial cataracts dashing down the topmost precipices, which form a magnificent feature in the landscape on the Tawaran.\n\nThe climate in the Tawaran valley is superb. At 5 a.m\nthe thermometer will often stand as low as 65\u00b0, while the keen,\ncold air blowing down from the black towering summits that\ncut the eastern sky-line, invigorates the frame and braces the\nmuscles for the coming labours of the day. It would require\na poet's pen to do anything like justice to the gorgeous scenic\neffects and grand transformation scenes, as the orb of day\nrises behind the jagged mountain barrier. The whole country\nis so well opened up, that the monsoons have free play, and\nfever should be comparatively unknown. The soil may be\ndescribed as sandy near the sea, but of every quality as one\nproceeds inland. Kina Balu bears about E.S.E. from the plain\nnear the river mouth.\n\nAn hour's walk brought us back to Brungis, where we had\nleft our pakerangan, or native boat, and some five hours\nmore brought us to Gaya island, whence a start was effected\nearly on the ensuing morning for the mouth of the Putatan\nriver.\n\nThe Putatan river has two mouths\u2014the Patagas mouth,\nwhich lies a little to the E. of S. of the most southerly point\nof Gaya island at a distance, in a direct line, of about five\nmiles, roughly estimated, and about half that distance south\nof Tanjong Aru; and its main mouth, Telipuk, which lies a\nshort distance to the southward of Tanjong Tegorongon. The\nformer is the most accessible entrance, the main kuala having\na very gradually shoaling foreshore, and but little depth of\nwater on it at high water. The Patagas mouth opens to the\nwestward and has depth of about one fathom at low water.\nA short distance from it, to the northward, off Tanjong Aru,\nthere is good anchorage close inshore for prahus and small\nboats, completely sheltered from both monsoons by an out-\nlying sand-bank. The Putatan river is an appanage of the\nSultan of Brunei, and of Pangiran Muda Bintar's family.\n\nA paddle of little over a mile and a half, passing en route,\non the true right bank, the confluence of the little river\nMunglab, brings one to a small Bajau village, the head of\nwhich is Datu Kilan. From this point the Patagas flows\nmore from the S.E., and becomes very narrow and tortuous\nup to its divergence from the main Putatan, rather more than\na mile further on, where (and situate therefore at the apex of\nthe delta of the (Putatan) is a large Bajau kampung containing some hundreds of inhabitants. Directly above this the Dusun country begins. The head of this village is Datu Setia. On landing some two miles further up, I found Gaya island bearing about due North. A cursory survey showed a fine open cultivated country, bounded some two miles off to the eastward by the foot-hills of the coast range, and dotted here and there with wooded knolls. The river maintains an average width of some seventy or eighty yards, with a winding course, whose main axis lies about East and West. It carries a good volume of water with a considerable amount of matter held in solution. From native report, it is not subject to severe floods, which may perhaps be attributed to its having two mouths to discharge by. Passing at 2 p.m. a considerable Dusun village, in which the very large house of Datu Barukis, the headman, is conspicuous, we fixed our head-quarters half an hour later, at the house of one Kawan, a Dusun, at a small hamlet named Kandayan. From this point \"Castle Peak\" (of the Admiralty Chart) bore S by W., while the right hand flank of Kina Balu bore 80\u00b0 E. of N. After a pleasant walk across a fine open country to the house of a Chinaman named Ah Kong, whose occupation is that of distilling arrack from rice, we were glad on our return to settle down for the night. A daughter of our host being ill with fever, I administered some medicine to her, and a regular smoking divan was then formed, all the men, and the ladies also, joining the circle. The Datu in this respect presents a favourable contrast to the seafarers, if not \"dour\" Malay. He and all his belongings, male and female, after doing the honours, will freely sit down with you and join in the conversation. These Putatan Dusuns are by far the best type of their race that I have met. They are tall, well-developed, clean-skinned, bright and intelligent looking people, who look what they are\u2014well-fed and well-to-do. Among the bevy of damsels that sat around, were some by no means unprepossessing in appearance, with bright dark eyes, open laughing countenances, clean limbs and well-turned figures. A chorus of laughter was evoked by my desperate endeavours to explain to an intelligent young Du-\nsun that the earth is round like an orange, and not only revolves on its own axis, but round the sun also. Our merriment was, however, interrupted by the ravings of the fever-stricken patient, who had become delirious. Thereupon the entire company rose and adjourned to the long and broad verandah, when a most curious \"function\" was performed. Damar torches were lighted, and all the men squatted down in a circle outside the door of the patient's room. In the centre sat her brother, back to back with another relation. A tremendous din was then struck up by the beating of numerous gongs, hanging along the walls, in a kind of measured cadence, varied at intervals by a loud shout raised by all the men present. A youngish woman then commenced to dance with a slow measured step and swaying to and fro of her body, round the inside of the circle. In her left hand she held a stick, furnished at one extremity with a curious arrangement of black feathers. In her right she held a naked sword. With this latter she continually made passes, bringing the blade down edgewise between the heads of the two sitting men, and then striking the feathered stick with it. This continued for some time. She then touched the heads of all present with her \"fetish\" rod, which was then discarded and a serong taken up in its place. With this she danced slowly round and round, holding it out extended in front of her. All this time the shouts were being vigorously given forth at intervals, while the clanging of gongs was deafening. The woman then made up the serong into a turban which she slowly brought down over the head of the sick woman's brother, letting it rest there for a few seconds. She then removed it and laid it gently down behind her, and the ceremony was over. A torch-light procession of travelling natives, passing the verandah just at this juncture, lent an additionally weird effect to the conclusion of this curious ceremony, whose strange rites and obscure origin may perhaps be admitted to warrant my description of it. Doubtless the idea is the casting of the evil spirit out of the sick person, and the good effects of the pills administered to the patient were probably set down to the credit of the ceremony.\n\nA remarkable thing in this district is the neatness and\ncomparative cleanliness of the bulk of the houses. Instead of the objectionable split nibong, the floors are made of beaten out bamboo, the walls, of the same material, neatly plaited, chess-board pattern. There are regular sleeping compartments, and a fine broad verandah runs from end to end of the house along the front of it. Our beds were arranged in the main body of the house, a fine lofty, airy apartment where dirt and mosquitoes were equally conspicuous by their absence. We noticed as a curious fact in these Dusuns, that they made use, in talking, of the letter Z, which would seem to point to their affinity to the Milanaus of Sarawak.\n\nAn early start on the ensuing morning brought us, after a seven-mile tramp, among the foot-hills of the coast range. We were here some twelve miles, or more, inland. On our way we passed the debouchure of the river Sugut, which joins the Putatan on its proper left bank, and further up, on the opposite side, the confluence of the Pagunan river, which is the true Putatan, the river bearing that name from this point, which we followed up, being in reality only a small tributary stream flowing from S.E. Pursuing our way up the valley of the latter, we reached our destination, a house at the foot of the hills, tenanted by an old Chinaman and his Dusun wife and daughter. We were here beyond the limits of the highly cultivated Putatan valley, and in a lovely country, at the point where the district of the Dusuns of the plain, marches with that of the Or\u00e9 Tagds, or Hill Dusuns. The Putatan valley is, without exception, the finest and most highly cultivated district in North Borneo. Without visiting it, it would be difficult for any one, accustomed only to such cultivation, or the lack of it, as is met with in other parts of North Borneo, to realize that, side by side with such districts, there exists one in which rice cultivation has been carried to the highest pitch of perfection, where every foot of soil is tilled, where substantial, and in many cases ornamental, land-marks of wood and stone have been erected all over the face of the country, and where the price of land ranges from $40 an acre or thereabouts. This country must be the granary of Brunei. The acreage of paddy is immense. One\nfield, or rather plain, must, at a rough estimate, have been some 600 acres in extent, the whole being marked off by the land-marks of the different proprietors. It was intersected by the Longhap, a small, canal-like stream. The water supply for purposes of irrigation is unlimited, the levels are well laid out and the banks neatly kept up, a path running along the ridge of each. It would, however, be of great benefit to the district were a fresh stock of paddy introduced, larger in the ear, the present stock being small in the grain and shewing signs of deterioration. There are some 80 to 100 Chinese settled on the Putatan, the bulk of them being the descendants of former Chinese settlers, who have intermarried with the Dusuns and shew evidence of mixed blood. These Chinese are not agriculturists, nor, as far as I could learn, landed proprietors, but are principally distillers, manufacturing arrack, which they barter with the Dusuns. The soil is decidedly superior to that of the valleys of the Papar and Kinabatangan rivers to the South, and there is an almost total absence of swamp, owing, no doubt, to the country being all cleared, and the complete system of drainage. The surface configuration is that of a practically level plain studded with numerous small hills, on which the timber has wisely been left standing. The paddy fields extend up to the very bases of these. In moist tracts and along the lines of water-courses, some sago is grown, but the quantity of this is inconsiderable. Some five piculs of gutta come down from the interior monthly, and tobacco, camphor, beeswax and armadillo skins form the staple exports. The Brunei Government imposes a tax of from $6 to $9 per head per annum, or about $200 for each pangkalan, or village landing-place. The number of the villages is remarkable, and in some parts of the upper portion of the river, they lie in sight of, and sometimes quite contiguous to, one another. The general aspect of the whole country is that of an orderly, industrious and civilized community, and a very fair prospect unfolds itself to the eye of one looking forth from the summit of one of the picturesque little hills above referred to, over the far stretching expanse of green paddy plains, clustering villages and detached homesteads nestling amid their\nsurroundings of tall cocoa-nut and spreading sago palms, while dotted over the plain, the numerous wooded knolls rise like islands amid a sea of green. It is a smiling landscape abounding in soft beauty, and backed by a range of noble mountains, with the father of them all\u2014the towering Kina Balu\u2014rearing his lofty mass on the northern horizon. Indeed, for general evidences of prosperity, plenty and industry, and of well applied principles of cultivation carried out on a most exhaustive and extensive scale, the Putatan district may be fairly said to be unequalled in the whole of North Borneo. The formation of the lowlands and foot-hills is sandstone of recent formation.\n\nThe Putatan does not apparently drain any of the Kina Balu water-shed, although the river, which, as before stated, goes by the name of the Pagunan above the confluence of the Putatan river so called, can, I was informed, be ascended for fifteen days. The Orang Tagds, a hill Dusun people, who wear the chawat, or bark loin-cloth, and who are found at the head-waters of all the rivers in N.W. Borneo, from the Tawaran to the Kimanis, inhabit the upper portion of the river down to its debouchure from the main coast range.\n\nI noticed a curious musical instrument, a species of guitar, called by the Dusuns tonkoomong. This is made of a piece of large bamboo about $2\\frac{1}{2}$ feet long and has 6 strings which are formed by the detaching and raising thin strips of the bamboo sheath. These are tightened at will by pushing a piece of wood along underneath each tow as its point of junction with the bamboo.\n\nTheir customs are much the same as those of the bulk of the Dusun race. An intending bridegroom has to pay a marriage portion for his bride. When a father dies, his lands and property go to his sons, the eldest getting the largest share. The widow has no share, but has a right to the usufruct of the estate during her life, and the daughters have a claim for support upon the estate until marriage. At his death, a Dusun, if a poor man, is buried in the ground, a small house being erected over his grave, from and above which various coloured calico streamers are dependent. If a rich man, his body is buried in a valuable old jar. The value of some of\nthese old jars is very great, amounting in some instances to hundreds of dollars, and the expenses of the funeral obsequies of an opulent Dusun chief often amount to over $600, buffaloes being killed and eaten, *tuak* consumed in large quantities, *obat* (fetish ceremonies) performed, etc.\n\nAlthough the Putatan cannot properly be described as a sago river, its delta would afford a large area of land suitable for planting the sago palm, the land being low-lying and swampy, and abutting on a good water-way on either side. The highlands of the interior are easily accessible up its valley, the climate is salubrious and pleasant, the population large and well-disposed, but the lands along its banks are firmly held and highly valued, and it is doubtful whether any area of such land could ever be brought into the market.\n\nThe course of the main Putatan, or Telipuk, to the sea, from the point at which the Patagas branch diverges from it, is somewhat tortuous but has a good depth of water. Its mouth, however, as already stated, is shoal and difficult of entry. An examination of an outcrop of the strata on its right bank, on the way down, shewed the strike to be S.E. with a dip of about 80\u00b0. A mangrove growth extends up both banks for a short distance from the *kuala*, and also along the coast on either side, and there is no beach available for landing on. This is not the case with the Patagas mouth which has a sandy beach and true jungle close to the sea with however mangroves inside.\n\nAs regards the state of cultivation of the tract watered by it, the Putatan may be fairly classed as the show river of North Borneo.\n\nS. ELPHINSTONE DALRYMPLE.\n\n[Erratum:\u2014Page 270, line 2, for 600 read 6,000.]\nMISCELLANEOUS NOTES.\n\nPROPOSED ENGLISH-MALAY DICTIONARY.\n\nStudents of Malay, among whom many members of this Society may be included, will learn with interest that Mr. H. C. Klinkert, one of the best Malay scholars in Holland, has it in contemplation to publish an English-Malay Dictionary, adapted from his new Dutch-Malay Dictionary now passing through the press.\n\nWhether the English edition will, or will not, be produced, will depend upon the measure of support which may be depended on. A certain number of subscribers should be forthcoming, in the first instance, to ensure that a work involving so much labour will not result in pecuniary loss. The publication of the work, if subscribers are found in sufficient number (and among these, the Government of the Straits Settlements, the Raja of Sarawak and the Directors of the British North Borneo Company may perhaps be counted upon for substantial support?), will be undertaken by Mr. E. J. Brill of Leyden, whose recently issued prospectus is subjoined:\n\n\"Mr. H. C. Klinkert whose scientific and practical publications on the Malay Language and Literature have already contributed so largely to the knowledge of that language, has, as the result of several years' study, undertaken the compilation of an English-Malay Dictionary, which is to be published next year. When, during the Oriental Congress at Leyden, Mr. Klinkert, speaking with some competent men on this publication, was requested to make it accessible to those also, who do not understand the Dutch Language. Though a very tedious work, he would not directly decline the request, if by a sufficient subscription it should appear that the work would meet the wishes of those who are to use it.\n\nWith regard to the manner in which he intends to compile this dictionary, he believes it to be in consonance with the spir-\nit of the language simple and natural, and\u2014what his long experience confirms\u2014thoroughly practical.\n\nThe transcription of the Malay words will be given in the dialect of the Straits-Settlements, after the manner adopted by Messrs. Maxwell and Krasberry.\n\nThe English part will be revised by a native Englishman. As soon as we have a sufficient number of subscribers\u2014we shall begin printing. The subscription price for one copy is twenty-five shillings, bound\u2014\n\nTo show the manner in which the author has formed his plan, and to give an idea of its completeness and extent, we give a specimen, annexed to this prospectus.\n\nThe whole will be about one thousand\u2014or one thousand two hundred pages.\n\nTo lay claim to completeness the Dictionary of the English and Malay languages now projected ought to be followed by a Dictionary of the Malay and English languages, the materials for which are in preparation. It will be published as a second volume, if the support accorded to the present volume gives sufficient encouragement.\n\nLeyden, October, 1884.\n\nE. J. BRILL.\n\nA subscription list has been opened by the Honorary Secretary of the Straits Branch, Royal Asiatic Society, Singapore; and members of the Society and the public who may wish to enter their names as subscribers can do so at the Raffles Library, Singapore, where the specimen sheet of the proposed Dictionary can be seen. As stated in the prospectus, the subscription price for one copy will be \u00a31 5s.

M. Skinner, Vice-President, in the Chair.\nThe minutes of the last general meeting were read and confirmed.\n\nThe Honorary Secretary read the Annual Report of the Committee for the year 1884. (See p. xiii.)\n\nThe Honorary Treasurer's Accounts for the year 1884 were laid before the meeting. (See p. xvii.)\n\nThe Report and Accounts were unanimously adopted without discussion.\n\nThe election of Officers for the year 1885 were then proceeded\nwith, and the following gentlemen were declared duly elected:\n\nPresident, ... The Hon'ble A. M. Skinner.\nVice-President, Singapore, ... W. A. Pickering, Esquire, C.M.O.\nVice-President, Penang, ... D. Logan.\nHonorary Secretary, ... The Hon'ble W. E. Maxwell, C.M.O.\nHonorary Treasurer, ... E. Koeck, Esquire.\n\nCouncillors, ... R. W. Hullett, Esquire.\n... A. Knight, Esquire.\n... H. L. Noronha, Esquire.\n... E. C. Hill, Esquire.\n... J. Miller, Esquire.\n\nThe new members elected provisionally by the Council since the last general meeting were then formally elected by an unanimous vote; and the meeting also elected the following gentlemen who were duly proposed and seconded:\u2014Messrs. C. B. Cerutti, F. H. Gottlieb, G. S. H. Gottlieb.\n\nMr. Knight then proposed that the Officers of the Society be added to by the creation of a Vice-President for Malacca, and that the Hon'ble D. F. A. Hervey be elected to that office.\n\nThe Honorary Secretary explained that the constitution of the Society is fixed by the Rules, and that before altering them, it would be desirable that notice should be given, and the nature of the proposed alteration made known to the members of the Society. This view was generally concurred in by those present. It was suggested in conversation that a sixth Councillor might be appointed, who should be resident in Malacca, but to this course the same objection applied. The Honorary Secretary said that he would be glad to see the meetings of the Society held under a Vice-President in Malacca, for that Settlement had a historical claim, having been the scene of a meeting of the Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1811, when Raffles and Leyden were there on their way to Java.\n\nMr. Knight said that he would, if necessary, give notice of his proposal at some future date.\n\nThe proceedings then terminated.\nANNUAL REPORT\nOF THE\nCOUNCIL\nOF THE\nSTRAITS BRANCH\nOF THE\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY,\nFOR THE YEAR 1884.\n\nThe Report which the Council for 1884 have to lay before the Annual General Meeting will, they believe, shew that the interest evinced in the objects for which the Society was established in 1878 continues unabated, and that those objects are being steadily kept in view by those to whom the management of the affairs of the Society is entrusted.\n\nThe new members elected provisionally by the Council since the last General Meeting are:\u2014\n\nWalter Egerton.  \nE. E. Abrahamson.  \nFran\u00e7ois Deloncle.  \nStair Elphinstone Dalrymple.  \nVan Langen.  \nL. Wray, Jr.  \nW. H. Diethelm.  \nD. Brandt.  \nA. T. Dew, P\u00e9rak.  \nA. W. O'Sullivan.  \nDr. D. Mauson Fraser, North Borneo.  \nSt. V. B. Down.  \nE. P. Gueritz, North Borneo.  \nW. G. Gullaud.  \nJ. P. Rodger, Selangor.  \nGeorge Copley.\n\nThese elections have now to be confirmed by the members present at the General Meeting.\n\nThe following members have retired:\u2014\n\nRevd. J. Aberigh Mackay.  \nGeneral H. Man.\n\nThe death of the following members has been announced:\u2014\n\nH. Herwig.  \nJ. T. Thomson, New Zealand.\nThe following gentlemen have ceased to be members in accordance with Rule 6:\n\nA. Anson.  \nR. Bruce.  \nB. Douglas.\n\nMohamed bin Mahboot.  \nW. Krohn.  \nGeorge Mansfield.\n\nIn the Report for 1883, mention is made of a text book of Eastern Geography which the Society had undertaken, at the request of the Government, to produce. The first part of this work (the Malay Peninsula and Borneo) has now been published, and the following letter regarding it has been received from the Government of the Colony:\n\n\"Colonial Secretary's Office,\nSingapore, 12th February, 1885.\n\nThe Honorary Secretary,\nStraits Asiatic Society, Singapore.\n\nSir,\u2014I am directed by the Acting Governor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo with regard to the publication of the work entitled 'Eastern Geography,' and to state that His Excellency fully recognises the valuable assistance which the Society has afforded to the Government in acceding to the request that it should undertake this work, and desires especially to tender the cordial thanks of the Government to the Vice-President (Mr. A. M. Skinner) for the valuable results of the action of the Society.\n\n2. The work which he has edited\u2014the first of its kind as regards this part of the world\u2014will, in His Excellency's opinion, prove of very great usefulness both inside the Schools of this Colony, and outside the Colony itself, where so much ignorance prevails regarding the Malay Peninsula and its neighbourhood.\n\n3. I am to add that His Excellency concurs in the recommendation of the Council of the Society, and will invite the Legislative Council to vote the necessary sum to enable Mr. Stanford's offer to be accepted. It appears to His Excellency that if the part regarding Australia is to be omitted, as His Excellency considers it should be, it may not even be necessary to pay so much as \u00a3100.\n\nI have, &c.,\n\nA. P. Talbot,\nfor Acting Colonial Secretary, S. S.\"\nThe scheme for republishing a selection of papers which have appeared from time to time in the Journals or Proceedings of learned Societies bearing upon matters of scientific interest in the Eastern Archipelago, has taken definite shape.\n\nThe consent of the Asiatic Society of Bengal having been received to the republication of papers relating to Indo-China which have appeared in their Journals, the first series of selections will consist of papers extracted from \"Asiatic Researches\" and the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. These will probably be preceded by a few papers originally published in Dalrymple's \"Oriental Repertory.\" The Council have been fortunate enough to secure the co-operation of Dr. Reinhold Rost, Librarian of the India Office, who has consented to edit the re-printed papers in London. It is hoped that two volumes will be brought out during 1885, and it will then rest with the Society whether or not to extend the scheme and continue to issue, from time to time, as funds may allow, further volumes of selected papers relating to the Far East.\n\nThe previous ventures of the Society in the direction of publishing, have not caused, in the aggregate, any pecuniary loss. The large Map of the Peninsula (1879) has, up to date, left a margin of profit of $33.63, with 8 copies still in hand.\n\nThe re-publication of the \"Hikayat Abdullah\" cost $400, of which $308 has been recovered, and 2 copies remain.\n\nIn the Department of Geography, the Council have noted with satisfaction the publication during the year 1884, by the Government of the Native State of Selangor, of a map of the State (published by Mr. E. Stanford, Charing Cross) on the scale of 2 miles to the inch.\n\nThe Skeleton Map of the Peninsula, upon which all new information is to be entered as exploration advances, mentioned in last year's Report, has been completed, and several maps and sketches embodying fresh geographical knowledge have been received from the Native States.\n\nThe most important of these is the Map of Ulu Pahang by Mr. W. Cameron, a most indefatigable explorer as well as a skilful surveyor and geologist.\n\nFour of the papers published in the Society's Journal since the last General Meeting are by Members who had not previously contributed, and the Council hope that they may infer from this that the number of active Members is increasing. They desire, however, to renew the appeal made in last year's Report, for\nliterary contributions on scientific subjects from those willing to cooperate in the objects of the Society.\n\nIt is believed that some will perhaps contribute notes, who have not leisure to write papers, and, in order to encourage this, it is proposed to develop the idea with which a few pages have usually been set apart in each number of the Journal for \"Miscellaneous Notes,\" and to publish in each future number a paper devoted to \"Notes and Queries,\" which will be edited by the Honorary Secretary.\n\nNo. 12 of the Journal of this Society (for the half-year ending December, 1883) did not appear until May, 1884, and No. 13 (for the half-year ending June, 1884) was only published in December last.\n\nThe absence of the Honorary Secretary from the Colony in the spring and autumn of the year partly accounts for this. No. 14 (for the last half-year of 1884) is now in the press.\n\nThe following papers have been published in the Journal of the Society since the last General Meeting:\u2014\n\n\"Malayan Ornithology\" (Part III), by Capt. Kelham, Highland Light Infantry.\n\"Gutta-producing Trees,\" by L. Wray, Jr.\n\"Shamanism in Perak,\" by W. E. Maxwell.\n\"Changes in Malayan Dialects,\" by A. M.

Its highest summit lies about S. 17\u00b0 E. of Thaipeng, distant, say, twenty miles as the crow flies. It is one of the series of nearly detached groups of mountains which form the coast-range, having their spurs and longest axes generally in a N.N.E. and S.S.W. direction. There is no record of any exploration of Gunong Bubu. It is said that some Europeans have ascended it and made a collection of plants, but what the Reverend Mr. Scortechini and I saw of the flora, inclines us to think that some of the adjacent and lower summits could only have been reached. The mountain is not quite 5,600 feet high, but rendered very inaccessible by precipices of granite 1,000 feet high, which bar most of the spurs. At the request of Sir Hugh Low, I undertook its exploration, accompanied by the Revd. B. Scortechini as botanist, and Mr. C. F. Bozzolo, who had charge of the Malays carrying our baggage. We started from the mountain garden at Arang Para, which is about 3,000 feet above sea level\u2014not a good point of departure, as we had to descend and then climb up again over several very steep spurs before we could reach even the foot of the range. The following is the journal.\n\nMay 20, 1884.\u2014Started from the mountain garden at 9 a.m. on a course due south, descending a very steep slope along a mountain track used by Chinese sawyers. It soon began to rain heavily, which made the steep path so slippery that\nprogress was exceedingly slow. We at last reached the bottom of a narrow gorge, through which a mountain torrent came down with considerable force. From this point to the summit of Gunong Babu, our road had to be cut through the jungle. After wading along the stream to find a convenient point for climbing the next spur or ridge, we crossed it, having difficult and slow climbing both in ascending and descending.\n\nThe forest was a close jungle of rattans and saplings, with an undergrowth of ferns which completely closed us in above and around. A second spur, still higher than the first, was ascended, but on its ridge we found the jungle in a slight degree more open, so we continued along it. It ascended slowly. In about two miles, finding that it was taking us too much out of our course, we left the ridge and crossed another spur which was very steep, rendering it necessary to proceed by a series of long zigzags. Rested in the furthest valley, and then mounted another ridge higher and steeper than any we had previously climbed. On the edge, we found an old rhinoceros beat, which we followed, ascending for about a mile, where it terminated on the summit of an almost precipitous bluff. The rain was so heavy at this point, that we had to wait till it ceased before we could descend. This was no easy matter, and occupied until nearly sunset in bringing down our baggage. In the valley, we found a branch of the Kenas River making a pretty cascade over large granite boulders. Here we built nice little sheds which the large-leaved Pinanga palm enabled us to thatch comfortably.\n\nMay 21.\u2014We left our encampment about 7.30, following the stream until it joined the Kenas River. Near this we found a species of Helicia, which is the second proteaceous plant we have noticed in Perak. We also found a splendid species of Fagraea, probably F. auriculata, with large fragrant\ncream-coloured flowers nearly a foot across the rotate corolla, the tube of which is eight inches long.\n\nThe Kenas River is about one hundred feet wide, descending in rapids amid large granite boulders. It contains many deep water-holes with fishes, different somewhat from those on the Perak. They are under examination, with a view to specific description. There are also land crabs about the stream and a peculiar species of prawn (Palemon?).\n\nFrom the Kenas, we struck to the west of south crossing two small, steep, densely-wooded spurs. This brought us to the base of a steep slope, which was at the foot of Gunong Bubu. Here the jungle became more open, being mostly composed of forest trees and Bertam palm (Engeissonia tricis). We soon lost sight of the Pinanga which we had found on the Kenas. There was a distinct rhinoceros beat on the crest, covered with foot-prints, which had been made only a few hours before. The logs which lay in the way were smoothed by the constant passing and repassing of these animals. There were also many of these water-holes and it was difficult to imagine that they had not been cut artificially on one side. The jungle was easily cut, but the track was so steep as scarcely to afford a footing in places. It took us nearly the whole day to climb a distance of 5,000 yards, and then we camped on a narrow terrace near a small trickling supply of water. Near this camp, we could hear the roaring of a large cascade, probably not far off, but the descent to it was too steep for us to attempt to reach it then. Our huts were built of attap and were large and comfortable. We had descended so much from our starting point that we were still below the level of the Hermitage garden of Arang Para.\n\nMay 22.\u2014Before starting this morning we sent back a party of Malays to bring up fresh supplies to this camp for our\nreturn journey. We got away about 8 A.M. It is very difficult to make an early move from these camps. What with cooking rice for the day and packing up the baggage, a good part of the morning runs away. Our journey was just like that of yesterday, only a little more steep in places. About 1,000 feet above camp we left the region of Bertam, or attap palms, and came into that of Licuala, growing amid high forest trees. Up to this time, we could not get a single view of the country around us. When we had ascended to the level of Arang Para we felled a number of trees in the hope of extending the prospect, but were unsuccessful. The ascent was now only very steep in places, and the spur curved much more to the north. When we reached the height of nearly 4,030 feet above the sea, we camped and built our houses. When this was done, we felled a good deal of timber on the northern slope of the spur and soon opened up an extensive view. Arang Para bungalow bore about E.N.E., but none of the Larut side of the range was visible, owing to the spurs of Mount Bubu. We had an abundance of water close to our camp. A small stream fell over about one hundred feet of rocks at a short distance below the terrace we were upon.\n\nNext day, the 23rd, we left all the baggage at our resting place, and proceeded to make a trial trip to reach the summit. We could get no reliable information from the Malays. Some said it was only two hours' journey, while others insisted that it would take the whole day. Our intention was to climb for half a day, and, if the difficulties were great, to move our camp on another stage. Our great delay, of course, was in cutting down the jungle and not being able to see more than a few yards around us. However, we were agreeably surprised to find a comparatively easy, though steep, ascent for\nabout a mile. After this, we had to climb by roots of trees, stumps and branches, and made but slow progress. I cannot say now whether this portion of our journey was on the face of a cliff or not. We could see absolutely nothing around us but trees and roots, and these overhung with such a thick coating of brown moss, ferns and orchids, that above and below were equally hidden. Sometimes we crept in and out under these roots and over them, or climbed a tree to get to some ledge near its upper branches, but where we were going, or how far we were, could only be guessed from the barometer. I do not suppose, however, that any one could climb so steep an ascent with less danger. One could not fall. It would puzzle any person to throw a stone more than a few yards amid such a thicket.\n\nAt five thousand feet by the aneroid, we began to see the first specimens of that graceful fern Matonia pectinata. This has never been previously recorded from Perak, and the only habitats are Java and Mount Ophir near Malacca, where it is associated with Dipteris Horsfieldii. The latter fern we had seen 1,000 feet below, and it occurs on all the mountains of Perak at heights a little over 3,500 feet but at Singapore it is found at the sea level. Besides this, there was plenty to see and admire in the way of ferns, orchids and mosses, with many curious fungi and lichens, for the moisture and deep shade made the place the very home of the cryptogamia. But the climbing was such very hard work, that attention to anything else was almost impossible. At about 5,400 feet, the entire vegetation changed. It was still a thicket, but more or less stunted and twiggy, very distressing to climb. I cannot say how long it continued, but long before I expected it, we suddenly found ourselves on an open level space, on the summit of Mount Bubu.\nThis, however, is not the highest point. The crest of the mountain is a narrow ridge about half a mile long, gradually sloping up to the northward until it is about 100 feet above where we then were. This might be called the lower shoulder of the ridge or crest. A splendid view was obtainable three-quarters round the compass, but the north was hidden by the higher summit.\n\nThe first thing that attracted our attention was the vegetation. The trees were all low and small, stunted and gnarled by the weather. Beneath there was a thick carpet of moss, into which the foot sunk some inches and when withdrawn left a pool of water on the foot-print. Above this was a most luxuriant growth of heather (*Lycopodium nutans*), while *Matonia pectinata* spread out its fan-like fronds on every side. The sides of the trees were hoary with long-bearded lichens (*Usnea barbata*) and mosses. There were only a few species of trees. One very common one was a conifer, but in the absence of any cones we were left in doubt whether it was *Dacrydium elatum* or some other species. Abundance of young plants of this pine covered the ground. There were also thickets of *Leptospermum flavescens*, which grew as high as the pine, and a shrub of the genus *Leucopogon*. The two latter are entirely Australian on their affinities, and both species are found on that continent. Besides these, there were abundance of Nepenthes or pitcher-plants with bushes of Rhododendrons (*R. verticillatum*?), with a *Gahnia* and some few other flowering plants and ferns.\n\nFrom this point, a hasty exploration was made to the highest point or northern summit of the mountain. Though scarcely half a mile in direct distance, it required considerably over a mile of hard climbing to reach it. The roots of the bushes have proved a kind of upper platform on the crest and\nthus one has to climb over and under in a most disgraceful manner, as the whole was an entangled mass of twigs which stopped and caught one at every side, besides being dripping with water. By the time the highest crest was reached, the clouds had gathered, and no view could be obtained. Having satisfied ourselves about the road, and cleared the most of it, we turned back. Though the descent was slower and more troublesome than going up, yet we reached our camp easily an hour before sunset. Our supplies had not arrived, and our chances of making a second ascent seemed rather uncertain. Our last rations of rice were served out that evening. On the next day (Queen's birthday, hence the camp was called Queen's Camp) we cleared away much more of the forest, but as the party were without food, and there were no signs of our messengers, we prepared, with much chagrin, to return to our lower camp. We had just packed everything when the supplies arrived. Our messengers had lost themselves in the jungle and this was the cause of the delay.\n\nOn the 27th, taking with us a light equipment for camping, we again ascended the summit of the mountain. After erecting our tents, or rather our waterproof sheets which served as a substitute, we went on to the summit and built an immense heap of wood and dammar resin to serve as a signal fire at night. Beyond the summit there is a steep valley and at the other side are isolated pinnacle of granite nearly as high as the mountain and perfectly precipitous except on the side of the valley. Messrs. Scortechini and Bozzolo ascended this with much hard climbing and found on the summit a small pile of stones and a flag-staff, while the remains of a flag were strewn on the ground. It is supposed that this flag was placed there at the instance of Captain Speedy, who paid the Malays a considerable sum to plant a flag there for surveying.\npurposes. We found no other signs that any person had visited the locality before.\n\nA perfect deluge of rain with thunder and lightning obliged Messrs. Bozzolo and Scortechini to remain on the granite pinnacle for some time, for the cloud and mist obscured everything and rendered it impossible to descend. I remained on the opposite summit superintending the erection of the bonfire. It was miserably cold, and we were all very glad when we could make our way back to our tents. This we did not do until the clouds cleared, when a magnificent view was unveiled. Both sides of the coast range were visible and the plains from the Dinding River to the town of Thaipeng were laid out like a panorama. The Matang opening with the village seemed just beneath us. The whole valley of the Perak with all the windings of the river were clear and distinct for a distance of fifty or sixty miles. The main range was also very clear and some of the highest peak bore a different aspect from anything I had seen before. An island between Perak and Sumatra, which is rarely seen from Mount Ijau, was now plainly visible, as also several summits of mountains to the south-east. Nothing could be seen of the mountain observed by Mr. Swettenham from Arang Para. The highest summit visible to us was, in my opinion, the sugar-loaf hill to the north and east of Gunong Robinson. I should think the mountain I refer to is between eight thousand and nine thousand feet high.\n\nAltogether, the view from the summit of Gunong Bubu is one of the finest imaginable. Rivers and mountains, dense forests and open plains, the distant sea and the unexplored forests to the eastward all combine to form a scene of wonderfully varied beauty. Unfortunately, however, the clouds and mists almost continually obscure this prospect. At early morning and after a heavy thunderstorm, the whole atmosphere is\ncomparatively clear. At other times, there is generally either a cap of cloud on the summit of the mountain itself or the whole valleys are shrouded with dazzling masses of steam-like white vapour in which the mountain tops peep out like islands.\n\nWe returned to our camp about sunset, and then proceeded to light our signal fires. We had one on each end of the crest so as to be well seen from the valley of the Perak on one side and Thaipeng on the other. Owing to the good supply of dammar we had obtained, we were able to kindle a very bright and conspicuous flame at each station and we were answered by fires from Sengang, Kwala Kangsa, and other places on the Perak river as well as from Kota and Matang on the Larut side. We also fired rockets, but these were not seen except in places very close to the mountain.\n\nOur tents were completely open on one side, but the cold was not great until nearly dawn. The temperature then went down to 58\u00b0 Fahrenheit, which was the lowest reached on this journey. At 4 A.M. we were visited by heavy rain and a strong wind from the east. Our shelter did not protect us from either, so that we passed the time rather uncomfortably until sunrise, when the rain ceased. Everything was then so wet that we could not attempt to dry our clothes, we therefore returned to Queen's Camp as speedily as we could. Having taken a hasty and scanty meal there, we made our way to our second day's camp reaching it easily at sunset. We expected to meet supplies at this camp, but they had not arrived. We had nothing but cocoa to serve out to our weary and hungry Malays after their long journey, but with this they were satisfied and went to rest quite cheerfully. An early start on the following morning enabled us to reach the Kenas River at an appointed depot, and here we found the much-needed supplies at about noon.\nI have already mentioned that, at the camp of the preceding evening, we could again distinctly hear the roar of some large cascade at about half a mile from where we were. We tried to search it, but the jungle was too thick and the descent too steep to do so that night, our want of provisions obliged us to push on without further delay in the evening. From the noise we heard, there must be a fine body of water, falling from a considerable height.\n\nThe camp we were now upon was not one we had occupied on our outward journey. It was on the River Kenas. The stream was here about eighty yards wide and descending in rapids amid large rocks. There were many deep pools of beautifully clear water. We spent a few days fishing on these pools, and caught a good many rock-fish and mullet about one pound in weight. Three species of fish were seen and a peculiar prawn. I believe the fish were species of *Barbus therapon*, and what I thought was *Polyacanthus cupanus*. The latter is the scaly fish (without barbels) which is found in the ditches and paddy fields.\n\nIn returning from the camp, we crossed the watershed between the Kenas and Kangsa, in order to explore the course of that river, which was not previously known. The watershed was somewhat difficult of access, and took us to a height of about three thousand feet above the sea-level. We had the misfortune to meet with bad weather and incessant rain during this part of the journey. The river Kangsa, even in its upper portions, was swollen into a fierce muddy stream, quite impassable, except on fallen trees. Of these there were many lying from bank to bank on the rocky sides of the torrent. We soon found that the water descended in a series of cascades for a depth of about 1,100 feet. I can give no idea of the grand magnificence of the scenery at this part of our jour-\nJOURNEY TO THE SUMMIT OF GUNONG BURU.\n\nWhether there was a flood in the river or not, the beauty of the rocks and precipices in the wild forest could not be surpassed. We had to descend by a series of zigzags crossing the successive cascades on logs sometimes at a considerable height above the water. If ever the romance of a lovely view was destroyed by the perils of a journey, it was here. We had to cross fifteen of these aerial bridges. Some were narrow and some were half rotten, and all were over cascades where the slightest slip was certain destruction. In the lower part of the stream we had to ford the water, which was just fordable and no more. I consider that it was quite wonderful that this part of our journey was accomplished without accident, which, however, was only effected by constant care and much delay. We arrived at Lady WELP's rest-house on the Kuala Kangsa Road on the evening of the last day of the month the most of which had been spent in the jungle, and none the worse for our sojourn away from civilization, except in the innumerable leech-bites from which we all suffered.\n\nJ. E. TENISON-WOODS.\n\nNote.\u2014Amongst the fishes of the Kenas there was a small specimen of what I took to be Ophiocephalus micropeltes, but the species is doubtful. The barbel may have been B. kolis.\n\nSince our journey, the mountain has been again ascended by Mr. Cantley, the Government Botanist, who obtained a good collection of plants.\nSEA DYAK RELIGION.\n\nII.\n\n(Continued from Journal No. 10 p. 243.)\n\nIn a former number of the Straits Asiatic Journal (No. 10), some account was given of the religious ideas and customs of the Sea Dyaks of Sarawak; of their belief in gods and evil spirits; of their sacrifices and auguries. The subject is incomplete without a consideration of their burial rites, and their ideas of eschatology. These I now endeavour to supply.\n\nBut first a word about marriage. Birth is not celebrated with any religious ceremony, and marriage is a comparatively simple matter. The marriage ceremony consists principally in publicly fetching the bride from her father's to the bridegroom's house, but the Dyak, with his love of divination, could not allow such an occasion to pass without some attempt, or pretence, to penetrate the secrets of the future. When the bridal party are assembled in the bride's house, and the arrangements for the young couple talked over, a pinang (betel-nut) is split into seven pieces by someone supposed to be lucky in matrimonial affairs; and these pieces, together with the other ingredients of the betel-nut mixture, are put in a little basket, which is bound round with red cloth and laid for a short time upon the open platform outside the verandah of the house: should the pieces of pinang by some mystic power increase in number, the marriage will be an unusually lucky one; but should they decrease, it is a bad omen, and the marriage must be postponed, or relinquished altogether; but, as matter of experience, they neither increase nor decrease; and this is interpreted in the obvious sense of an ordinary marriage upon which the spirits have pronounced neither good nor bad. This action gives the name to the whole ceremony, which is called Mah* pinang\u2014splitting the betel-nut. When the bride has\n\n* Belak, Malay.\u2014Ed.\nbeen brought to her future husband's house, a fowl is waved* over them, with a hastily muttered invocation for health and prosperity; and with this semi-sacrificial action the marriage is complete.\n\nDeath is much more involved with sacred observances. Although the Dyaks have something of the Moslem sentiment of fate, and commonly speak of the measure of a man's life, which once reached nothing can prolong, yet this does not seem to help them to a quiet submission to the inevitable; for, even when death is unmistakeably drawing near, they are eager in fruitless efforts of resistance, and the scene is generally one of tumultuous wailing. They will shout wildly to the medicine-man to recover the wandering spirit, and they will call out to the dying\u2014\"Come back; do not go with the spirits who are leading you astray to Hades. This is your country, \"and we are your friends.\" The word pulai, pulai, \"return, return,\" is reiterated in piercing, piteous tones. Silence and reverent awe in the presence of death would be regarded as culpable callousness to the interests of a life trembling in the balance. And when actual dissolution is plainly imminent, they dress the person in the garments usually worn, and some few ornaments in addition, that the man may be fully equipped for the untried journey; and in violent demonstrations of grief, the women and younger people wait the end, or perhaps rush distractedly about in hopes of doing something to delay it. As soon as respiration has ceased, a wild outburst of wailing is heard from the women, which proclaims to all the village that life is extinct. The cessation of visible breathing is with the Dyak the cessation of life; he knows of no other way to distinguish a prolonged state of coma from death, and I have good reason to believe that sometimes bodies have been buried before they were corpses.\n\nAfter death the body is lifted from the room to the ruai, or verandah, of the village-house; some rice is sprinkled upon the breast, and it is watched until burial by numerous relatives and friends who come to show their sympathy. The nearer connections of the deceased will probably be heard\n\n* This waving of a sacrifice or offering is a noticeable feature in the practice of Hindu exorcists in India.\u2014Ed.\nshouting out to some departed relative to come from Hades and take them away also, feeling at the moment that life is unbearable. At a burial once I saw a woman jump down into the grave, and stretch herself at full length upon the coffin loudly begging to be buried with her husband.\n\nAmong some tribes, there are professional wailers, nearly always women, who are hired to wail for the dead. One of these is now fetched, not only to lament the lost, but by her presence and incantation to assist the soul in its passage to Hades. Her song takes about twelve hours to sing, and the sum of it is this. She calls with tedious prolixity upon bird, beast and fish to go to Hades with a message, but in vain, for they cannot pass the boundary. She then summons the spirit of the winds to go, and\u2014\n\n\"Call the dead of ancient times,\n\"To fetch the laid out corpse under the crescent moon,\n\"Already arranged like the galaxy of the milky way.\n\n\"To call those along ago bent double,\n\"To fetch the shroud of our friend below the moon,\n\"Already a heap like the hummock of the renguang. (1)\n\n\"To call the far away departed,\n\"To fetch the nailed coffin under the dawn of the rising sun,\n\"Already like the form of a skilled artisan's chest.\n\n\"To call the long departed ones,\n\"To fetch the resak-wood coffin below the brilliant moon,\n\"Already bound with golden bands.\"\n\nThe Spirit of the Winds is reluctant at first; but, at the solicitation of his wife, at length consents to do the wailer's bidding. He speeds on his way through forests and plains, hills and valleys, rivers and ravines, until night comes on and he is tired and hungry, and stops to make a temporary resting place. After refreshing himself, he goes up a high tree to make sure of the proper road. \"He looks round, and all is dark and dim in the distance; he looks behind, and all is obscure and con-\n\n(1) A crustacean which burrows in the earth.\n\"fuse: he looks before him, and all is gloomy as night.\" On all sides are roads, for the ways of the dead are seventy times seven. In his perplexity, he drops his human spirit form, and by a stroke of ghostly energy metamorphoses himself into rushing wind; and soon makes known his presence in Hades by a furious tempest which sweeps everything before it, and rouses the inhabitants to enquire the cause of the unwonted commotion. They are told. They must go to the land of the living and fetch so and so and all his belongings. The dead rejoice at the summons, and without delay collect their friends, get into a boat and pull through the stygian waters; and with such force does the boat plough the lake, that all the neighbouring fish die. Arrived at the landing place, they all make an eager rush into the house, \"like soldiers who fly upon the spoil; and mad like wild pigs they seize the dead one.\" The departed soul cries out in anguish at being thus violently carried off; but long before the ghostly party has reached their abode, it becomes reconciled to its fate.\n\nThus sings the wailer, who has now done her work. She has conveyed the soul to its new home, which it would never reach, it is said, without her intervention; but remain suspended somewhere, and find rest nowhere.\n\nThe climate necessitates a speedy interment; but there is another reason for putting their dead quickly out of sight. After life is extinct, the body is no longer spoken of as a body or corpse; it is an antu, a spirit; and to have it long with them would, apart from sanitary considerations, expose them to sinister ghostly influences. Some time before daylight, a sufficient number of men take away the corpse wrapped in mats and secured with a light framework of wood; and as it is being borne from the house, ashes are thrown after it, and a water-gourd is flung and broken on the floor. The graveyard is generally a small hill, or rising ground in the neighbourhood, as unkempt as the surrounding forest, overshadowed by towering trees, and full of an entangled undergrowth of grass, climbers and thorny rotan. On coming to the cemetery, the first thing done is to kill a fowl to propitiate the dread powers of Hades, to whom the ground is supposed to be devoted: and so strong is the need of this sacrifice felt, that no Dyak,\nunenlightened by other principles, will dare touch the ground until it is made. Some now dig the grave; some cook a meal, which is afterwards eaten on the spot; whilst others get a large log of wood of the required length, split it into two, scoop out the inside sufficiently to admit the corpse, and thus make a rude coffin, the two parts of which, after receiving the body, are firmly lashed together with rotan. Sometimes, however, the coffin is made of planks before proceeding to the graveyard.\n\nWith the burial of the body is deposited baiya, that is, things given to the dead. Personal necessaries, like rice, plates, the betel-nut mixture, money and a few other articles are laid with the body in the ground; whilst spears, baskets, swords, weaving materials, pots, jars, gongs, etc., are put on the surface, the jars and gongs being broken to render them useless to any alien who may be inclined to sacrilegious depredations.* This baiya, little or much according to the wealth of the deceased, is regarded as a mark of affection, and to omit it is to fail in a natural duty. But the custom is really founded upon the belief that the things so bestowed are in some mystic way carried into the other world, and useful to the dead\u2014their capital, in fact, to begin life with in the new stage of existence. And in cases where Dyaks are killed, or die by sickness, far away from home, the baiya is still deposited in the family burying-place. A burial without baiya is, in their phrase, the burial of a dog. A fence round the grave as a protection from ravages by wild pigs completes the interment.\n\nThere is a deeply-seated fear amongst Dyaks touching everything connected with death and burial rites. They have for instance, a lurking suspicion that the dead, having become the victims of the most terrible of all powers, may harbour envious feelings, and possibly follow the burying-party back to their homes with some evil intent. To prevent such mischief, some of them will make a notched stick-ladder,\u2020 and fix it upside\n\n* Compare the observances of the Johor Jakuns, No. 7 of this Journal p. 97.\u2014Ed.\n\u2020 The tangga samangat of the Johor Jakuns is said \"to enable the spirit to leave the grave when required.\" Id.\u2014Ed.\ndown in the path near the cemetery to stop any departed spirit who may be starting on questionable wanderings; others plant bins of stick to imitate bamboo caltrops to lame their feet should they venture in pursuit, and so obstruct their advance.\n\nInterment is the usual, but not universal, mode of disposing of the dead. *Mangas*, or medicine men, are suspended in trees in the cemetery; and amongst the Balau tribe, children dying before dentition has developed enjoy the same distinction, having a jar for their coffin. Some eccentric individuals have a dislike to be put underground, and request that after death they may be laid upon an open platform in the cemetery; the result of which is that a most offensive exudation soon oozes from the badly made coffin; and after a year or two the posts become rotten, and the whole structure tumbles down, the coffin bursting in pieces, adding to the already large stock of exposed bones, which, with broken pots, jars, baskets, and other miscellaneous articles, swell the property of grim death, and make the place a vast charnel awesome and gloomy, well calculated to frighten the superstitious Dyak. Occasionally, a man has a fancy to have his body put on the top of a mountain, and the relatives probably dare not refuse to carry out the wish through fear of imaginary evil consequences. Among the Kayans, this burial above ground is the general practice, but they carry it out in a more substantial manner. The *baiya* is put in the coffin, but heads of slain enemies are hung\n\n---\n\n*Even among the Malays of the Peninsula, this practice of keeping the body of a *pucang*, or medicine-man, above ground is not unknown. It exists also probably among the Sakai tribes. *Blian taun* is the Sakai name for the original tiger-spirit or man-tiger. A man who has a tiger-spirit as his familiar is a *pucang blian*, and may not be buried in the ordinary Malay way, but his body must be placed leaning against a *prah* tree, in order that the spirit may enter into another man.*\n\nIn Perak, it is said that in the time of Sultan J'afar there was a *pucang* of the *hantu blian*, named *Alang Dewasa*. When he died (at Buluh Minyak in Ulu Perak) his relations would not permit his body to be set up against a tree, but buried it. Soon afterwards the ground was found disturbed, and since then *Alang Dewasa* has frequently appeared as a *hantu blian*, when invoked by *pucangs* of that class (See Journal No. 12, p. 224). He comes down in the shape of a tiger, with one eye closed, the effect of an injury he received when buried, or when leaving the earth to assume his animal form.\u2014En.\nSEA DYAK RELIGION.\n\nup round the grave. Great warriors have been sometimes buried for a time and then exhumed, and their relics sacredly kept by their descendants in or near their houses, or it may be, on the spur of a neighbouring hill, with the object of securing the departed ancestor as a tutelary spirit.\n\nSea Dyaks do not consider burial as the last office which they can render to the dead, but follow them up with certain after-ministries of mixed affection and superstition. For three or four evenings after death, they light a fire somewhere outside the house for the use of the departed; for in Hades, they say, fire is not to be procured without paying for it. After burial, the nearest relation lives in strict seclusion and keeps a comparative fast until the observance called pana is made. A plate of rice with other eatables is taken by one of the neighbours to this chief mourner, and from this time he or she returns to the usual diet, and occupations of life. But this neighbourly act to the living is the least part of pana, amongst those tribes, at least where professional wailers exist. It is principally concerned with the dead, to whom by it food is supposed to be sent. Boiled rice and other things usually eaten with it, together with Dyak delicacies, are put together, and thrown through the opening at the back of the house, and the wailer is fetched to effect their transmission to Hades. She comes again to the house of mourning, not to lament over the dead\u2014that is left for the relatives to do\u2014but to call upon the adjutant bird, \"the royal bird which fishes the waters all alone,\" to do her bidding in conveying the articles of the pana to the other world. Among these are included with some pathos the sorrows and sighs of the living.\n\n\"To carry the pana of tears to the departed one\nat the clear mouth of the Potatoe river.\n\"To carry deep sighs to those sunk out of view\nin the land of the red ripe rambutan\n\"To carry pitying sobs to those who have fallen\nunripe in the land of empty fruiting limes.\"\n\nThe bird, says the song, speeds on its way, and after taking a rest on the bacha tree, which bears for flower one dark red bead, arrives in the region of the departed. There\nthey do not recognize the visitant, and inquire where it comes from and why: \"Do you come to look at the widows? We have thirty and one; but only one is handsome. Do you come to seek after maidens? We have thirty and three; but only one is pretty.\" \"No,\" says the bird, \"we have widows and maidens plenty in the land of the living, all beautiful and admired of men.\" \"What is that you have brought with you so securely covered up?\" \"Get a basin, and I will pour the contents of my burden into it.\" The basin is brought and receives the pana, and lo! the eatables and the tears and the sobs of the living mourners have become gold and silver and precious stones wondrously beautiful. But neither the men or the women know what they are; and mutual accusations of ignorance and stupidity are bandied about, and a noisy quarrel is the result. At this juncture, an ancient native of Hades appears, one, that is, who never was an inhabitant of this world;\n\nDara Rabai Gruda\u00ae\nDayang Sepang Kapaiya.\n\nShe chides their unseemly squabbling, and explains to them that the bird has come from the realms of the living with presents from their friends; whereupon they are seized with a passionate desire to return, but are told that this is impossible.\n\n\"The notched ladder is top downwards.\nTheir eyes see crookedly.\nTheir feet step the wrong way.\nTheir speech is all upside down.\"\n\nTheir capacities are no longer adapted to the world they have left, and their destiny is irreversible; but still they urge their request to accompany the bird, and all the ingenuity of Hades is called in requisition to devise means of amusing the souls as yet unaccustomed to their new dwelling. Meanwhile, the bird takes its homeward flight. Thus far the wailer.\n\nUntil this pana is made, say the Dyaks who observe it, the soul is not thoroughly conscious that it has departed from the world, and Hades will not give it food or water; but after this, it is received as a regular denizen of deathland.\n\n*Garuda*, the eagle of Vishnu? See No. 7 of this Journal, p. 13.\u2014Ed.\nThere is a similar observance called *sumping*, which is carried out at a varying period after death. They take the symbols and trophies of a head-hunting raid, and the wailer is supposed to procure the services of the spirit of the winds to convey them to the dead, whose abode, before full of darkness and discomfort, is now, at sight of the trophies, filled with light; for they have the satisfaction of feeling that their relations have revenged upon others their own death; so henceforth they stand more freely upon their own footing.\n\nThis observance, which, according to ancient custom, could not be performed until the head of an enemy had been obtained, brings out the darker and fiercer side of the Dyak nature. They would fight with death if they could; but as they cannot, they rejoice in taking vengeance upon the living, whenever a chance of killing the enemies of their tribe offers itself; so as to be able to say to themselves: \"My relatives have revenged my death. I am now on equal terms with the evil fate which has sent me hither.\" But in these times, when they live under a strong and civilized government, it is very seldom that this observance can be carried out in its fulness; and therefore it is either slurred over by some mild substitute, or omitted altogether.\n\nBut the great observance for the dead is the *Gawai antu*, Festival of Departed Spirits. No definite period is fixed for the celebration of it, and the time varies from one to three or four years. The preparation for it of food and drink and other things is carried on for weeks and even months; and sometimes it taxes very severely the resources of the Dyak. When all is ready, the whole neighbourhood for miles round is invited to partake of it. It is an opportunity for a general social gathering; it is a formal laying aside of mourning; above all, it is, in their minds, the execution of certain offices necessary for the final well-being of the dead.\n\nBut though it is a feast for the dead to which they are invoked and invited, yet they pretend to guard against any unorthodox and premature approach of the departed as full of uncanny influence. When the *tuak*, a drink brewed from rice, has been made, an earthenware potful of it is hung up before the door of the one room which each family of the\nvillage house occupies, so as to attract the attention of any casual wanderer from Hades. Such a one is supposed to see the pot, and to go and regale himself from it, and be satisfied without going further; and thus his thoughts are pleasantly diverted from the inner seat of family life; the room\u2014where, if permitted to enter, he might possibly, in revengeful spite, carry off some of the living circle.\n\nThe presence of the dead is desired, but only at the proper time and in the proper way. But how are they to come from Hades in the numbers desired? Nothing easier, thinks the Dyak, send a boat for them: So he despatches what is called the lumpang. A piece of bamboo in which some rice has been boiled is made into a tiny boat, which, by the aid of the wailer, who is again fetched, is sent to Hades. Actually, it is thrown away behind the house; spiritually, it is supposed by the incantation of the wailer to be transmitted to the unseen realm through the instrumentality of the king of all the fishes, who accomplishes the journey without much trouble. But in Hades he dare not ascend the great river of the dead beyond the first landing place, where he leaves the mystic craft together with food and drink. No sooner is this done than the stream becomes dammed up and overflows its banks. The curious boat is seen floating upon the swollen waters, but no one knows what it is. At length a water nymph rises out of the river, and tells them that the strange craft, which by this time has grown from the size of a toy to a mighty war-boat, has been sent by their living friends for their passage across the styx to partake of a final banquet. Great is the joy of Hades on discovering this.\n\n\"Their shouts reach beyond the clouds.\n\"They incite each other like men preparing the drums.\n\"With joy they thump their breasts.\n\"With gladness they slap their thighs.\n\"We shall soon feast below the star-sprinkled heavens.\n\"We shall soon eat where the roaring thunder falls.\n\"We shall soon feed below the suspended moon.\n\"We shall soon be on our way to visit the world, and march to the feast.\"\n\nWith this contrivance, the way is now open for the\ndeparted to visit their old habitations as soon as the feast shall be ready and the final summons sent. Meanwhile preparations for the festival advance. Those tribes who erect ironwood memorial monuments at the graves get them put together. On the day of the feast, or may be the day before, the women weave with finely split bamboo small imitations of various articles of personal and domestic use, which are afterwards hung over the grave, that is, given to the dead. If it be a male for whom the feast is made, a bamboo gun, a shield, a war cap, a sirih bag and drinking vessel, etc. are woven; if a female, a loom, a fish basket, a winnowing fan, sunshade, and other things; if a child, bamboo toys of various descriptions.\n\nThe guests arrive during the day, and the feasting begins in the evening, and lasts all night. An offering of food to the dead is put outside at the entrance of the house. The wailer of course is present, and her office now is to invoke the spirit of the winds to invite the dead to come, and feast once more with the living; and she goes on to describe in song the whole imaginary circumstances\u2014the coming of the dead from Hades, the feasting, and the return. She sings how numerous animals, one after another, and then Salampundai, maker of men, are called upon to go to Hades, but none have the capacity to undertake such a journey; how the spirit of the winds arrives in Hades, and urges the acceptance of the invitation by expatiating on the abundance and excellence of the food their relations have provided for them; how they and a great company of friends start, and make the journey hither in the boat before sent for them; how glad they are to see our earth and sky again, and to hear the many voices of the busy world; how they eat and drink, dance, and have a cock-fight with their living friends (for they have brought fighting cocks with them); how Hades is beaten (to make it victorious would be a bad omen); how they ask for their final share of the family property, and a division is made, but here again the dead get the worst of it, for in dividing the paddy, the living get the grain, the dead only the chest in which it is kept; so, the jars remain with the living, the stand only on which they are set being given to the dead; the weapons too are retained, whilst the sheaths go to Hades, etc., etc. In the very act of\nprofessing to entertain their friends, they must cheat them for fear of conceding too much to Hades, and so hasten their own departure thither. After this pretended division of property, the children of deathland make their parting salutation with much affection and regret and go on their way. Such is the esoteric meaning of the festival according to the wailer's song.\n\nThe song makes the dead arrive about early dawn; and then occurs an action wherein the intercommunion of the dead and the living is supposed to be brought to a climax. A certain quantity of tuak has been reserved until now in a bamboo, as the peculiar portion of Hades, set apart for a sacred symposium between the dead and the living. It is now drunk by some old man renowned for bravery or riches, or other aged guest who is believed to possess a nature tough enough to encounter the risk of so near a contact with the shades of death. This \"drinking the bamboo,\" as it is called, is an important part of the festival.\n\nEarlier in the night comes the formal putting off of mourning. The nearest male relation is habited in an old waistcloth, or trousers; these are slit through and taken away, and the man assumes a better and finer garment; a bit of hair from each side of the head is cut off and thrown away. In case of female relations, some of the rotaa rings which they wear round their waists are cut through and set aside; and they now resume the use of personal ornaments. This action is represented as a last farewell to the dead.\n\nThe morning after the feast, the last duty to the dead is fulfilled. The monument, if any, the bamboo imitation articles, the cast off garments, with food of all kinds are taken and arranged upon the grave. With this final equipment, the dead are said to relinquish all claims upon the living, and to go henceforward on their way, and to depend upon their own resources. But before the Gavei antu is made they are thought to carry on a system of secret depredations upon the eatables and drinkables of the living, in other words, to come for their share. When sitting down to his plate of rice, a Dyak will sometimes be seen to throw a little under the house as a portion for a departed one. And I have been told that in the morning the footprints of the dead are sometimes visible in\nthe paddy stores from which they have been supplying themselves under cover of darkness. They are driven to such little foraging expeditions, it is said, by the necessities of their position; for the powers of Ha'les look with contempt upon any who go thither insufficiently provisioned, and even quarrel with them. And worse still is said to happen if this feast be omitted altogether: the dead lose their personality, and are dissolved into primitive earth. Hence charity to the dead and motives of economy urge the Dyak to undertake the labour and expense of the Gavei antu, the preparation of which seriously hinders the farmwork, and diminishes the following year's crop of paddy.\n\nAccording to ancient custom, this Feast of the Spirits could not be held until a new human head had been procured, but this ghastly, yet valued, ornament to the festival has now to be generally dispensed with.\n\nThus far I have, in the main, followed Dyak thought about death and the afterstate as it is embodied in their tribal ceremonies and songs; but as might be expected popular thought is not without its ideas and theories; and these supplement what has hitherto been said.\n\nIn the borderland, says the Dyak, between this world and the next, is situated the house of the Bird bubut, a bird here, a spirit there, covering his identity in human form. Every human spirit in the extremity of sickness comes to this place: if it goes up into the house, by the influence of the bird it returns to the body, which thereupon recovers; but if it avoids the house, as is more probable, because it is always in a filthy state of dirt and stench, then it is well on its way to the other world. There is, however, another chance for it at the \"Bridge of Fear,\" a see-saw bridge stretching across the Styx, and difficult to pass over: if the soul makes successfully the passage, it is gone past recovery; if it falls into the water, the cold bath wakes it up to a sense of its real position, and determines it to retrace its steps.\n\nAfter this, it seems, the soul has to pass the \"Hill of Fire.\" Evil souls are compelled to go straight over the hill with scorching fire on every side, which nearly consumes them; but good ones are led by an easy path round the foot, and so\nescape the pain and danger.* This is the only connection in which I have met with anything which suggests the idea of future retribution for wrong doing in this life.\n\nDyaks attribute to the dead a disposition of mixed good and evil towards the living, and so alternately fear and desire any imaginary contact with them. As has been said before, they do not speak of taking a \"corpse\" to the grave, but an antu, a spirit; as though the departed had already become a member of that class of capricious unseen beings which are believed to be inimical to men. They think the dead can rush from their secret habitations, and seize invisibly upon any one passing by the cemetery, which is, therefore, regarded as an awesome, dreaded place. But yet this fear does not obliterate affectionate regard, and many a grave is kept clean and tidy by the loving care of the living; the fear being united with the hope of good, as they fancy the dead may also have the will and the power to help them. I was once present at the death of an old man, when a woman came into the room, and begged him, insensible though he was, to accept a brass finger ring, shouting out to him as she offered it: \"Here, grandfather, take this ring, and in Hades remember 'I am very poor, and send me some paddy medicine that I may get better harvests.'\" Whether the request was granted, I never heard. Sometimes they seek communion with the dead by sleeping at their graves in hope of getting some benefit from them through dreams, or otherwise. A Dyak acquaintance of mine had made a good memorial covering over the grave of his mother of an unusual pattern, and soon fell ill, in consequence, some said, of this ghostly work. So he slept at her grave feeling sure she would help him in his need, but neither voice nor vision nor medicine came; and he was thoroughly disappointed. He said to me: \"I have made a decent resting place for my mother, and now I am ill and ask her assistance, she pays no attention. I think she is very ungrateful.\"\n\n*According to the creed of the Badagas in Tamil India, the souls are obliged to pass by a column of fire which consumes the sinful, and it is only after perils that they reach the land of the blessed by a bridge of rope.\" Peschel, Races of Man, p. 284, quoting Baerlein, Nach und aus Indien.\u2014Ed.\nThis belief in reciprocal good offices between the dead and the living comes out again in those cases where the remains of the dead are reverently preserved by the living. On every festival occasion, they are presented offerings of food, etc., in return for which these honoured dead are expected to confer substantial favours upon their living descendants.\n\nTheir notions of the relationship of this world to the next, and of the dead to the living, will be further illustrated by the story of Kadawa; which may also be taken as a specimen of their folklore.\n\nKadawa was a great cock-fighter, but had suffered successive defeats from his fellow Dyaks. Irritated at being beaten in a sport he so dearly loved, he started off to seek a cock of a particular white and red plumage, called biring grunggang, which he believed would bear down all others before it. But a chanticleer of this peculiar plumage was a \"rara avis\" among fowls; and village after village was visited, and neither for love or money could the coveted bird be got, for the simple reason that there were none. Nothing daunted, he started off again to go further afield, and determined not to return till he had succeeded in his quest. He travelled hither and thither in the land of the Dyaks until he knew not where he was, and at length arrived at the land of Mandai idup, the borderland between Hades and this world, the inhabitants of which can visit one or the other as they wish. Here a long village house appeared in sight. He went up the ladder into it; and to his astonishment it showed all the signs of being inhabited, even to the fires burning on the hearth and the sounds of surrounding voices; but not a person could be seen; so he shouted out: \"Ho, where are you all?\" Whereupon an unembodied voice answered: \"Is that you, Kadawa? Sit down and eat pinang and sirih. What do you want?\" \"I am come to beg or buy a biring grunggang, fighting cock.\" There is not one to be had here, but if you go on to the next village, you will find one.\" So Kadawa trudged on, greatly wondering at the strangeness of a place peopled by bodiless beings, talking working phantoms of men and women. Soon after, he came to a populous place, where many village-houses were clustered together\u2014Mandai mati,\nthe first district of the land of the dead; but Kadawa knew it not for it had nothing to remind him of death; the people moved about, spoke and had the same form and feature as his own neighbours: moreover they recognized and called him by name. They offered to give him a biring grunggang, which he gladly accepted. Having now obtained his object, he was happy, and finding the people sociable and hospitable, he was in no hurry to return, but remained with his new-found friends more than a year, oblivious of home and its duties.\n\nBut what of his wife and child whom he had left behind in his house? She was grieved at his long absence, and at last resolved that he must be dead and she wept and bewailed him; and at length she died of sorrow.\n\nThe time came when the relations made the Gawe antu for her; and the wailer was bringing the company of guests from Hades to the feast. Just at that time Kadawa had determined upon returning, and was securing his fighting cock and buckling on his sword, when some one called to him to go on the platform in front of the house, and pointed out to him a procession marching along the hill opposite the house. Kadawa looked and saw in the middle of the long train his own wife; and it flashed upon him that his wife was dead and he himself within the confines of deathland. Without speaking a word he caught up his fighting cock, sword and spear and rushed to join his wife. She repelled him, but in vain. At length they came to the stygian lake and found a boat lying on the shore, into which they all hurried, trying to keep Kadawa out; but he vigorously persisted, and was allowed to embark. After paddling several hours the boat struck upon a rock, and would not move: all except Kadawa jumped out to pull her off, but she would not budge an inch. Kadawa was called upon by his wife to help; but he refused for fear of being left behind\u2014says his wife: \"Do you not know I am dead? What is the use of trying to follow me?\" \"Let me die also, I will not leave you.\" \"Very well,\" replied his wife, \"since you are resolved to come with me, when we get to the house, you will find some dried sugar cane over the fire place: eat that, and you will be able to bear me company.\"\n\"Now get out, and help to pull the boat off the rock.\" He jumped out, and as soon as his feet touched the rock, boat people and lake vanished, and he found himself standing at his own doorstep.\n\nBut no pleasure did his return bring him, for he found his friends making the last farewell feast for his wife. He neither ate nor drank nor shared in the festivities; but kept in his own room till all was over when he thought of the sugar cane over the fireplace. He searched for it, but found nothing more than a roll of poisonous *tuba* root: again and again he looked but nothing else was there; so he concluded that this was what his wife meant by the sugar cane. He spoke sorrowfully to his neighbours and told them he should not live long, and begged them to be kind to his orphan boy and give him his inheritance; then he returned to his room wrapped a blanket round him and laid himself on the floor chewed the fatal root and joined his wife in deathland.\n\nI have thus traced the general belief of the Sarawak Sea Dyak about his future existence. There are however exceptions to it. Occasionally the idea of metempsychosis is met with. At one time the spirit of a man is said to have passed into an alligator; at another into a snake, etc., the knowledge of it being always revealed by dreams. Sometimes a Dyak will deny the possibility of any future existence; but only I think to serve the purpose of an argument. But these, wherever found, are deviations from the general belief.\n\nBut it is no gloomy Tartarus, nor is it any superior happy Elysium to which the Dyak looks forward; but a simple prolongation of the present state of things in a new sphere. The dead are believed to build houses, make paddy farms, and go through all the drudgery of a labouring life, and to be subject to the same inequalities of condition and of fortune as the living are here. And as men helped each other in life, so death, they think, need not cut asunder the bond of mutual interchanges of kindly service; they can assist the dead with food and other necessaries; and the dead can be equally generous in bestowing upon them medicines of magical virtue.\n\n*Cocculus indicus.\u2014Ed.*\namulets and talismans of all kinds to help them in the work of life. This sums up the meaning of their eschatological observances which perhaps exceed those of most other races of mankind.\n\nBut this future life does not, in their minds, extend to an immortality. Death is still the inevitable destiny. Some Dyaks say they have to die three times; others seven times; but all agree in the notion, that after having become degenerated by these successive dyings, they become practically annihilated by absorption into air and log, or by a final dissolution into various jungle plants not recognized by any name. Maybe, they lack the mental capacity to imagine an endless state of liveable life.\n\nJ. PERHAM.\nTHE HISTORY OF PERAK FROM NATIVE SOURCES.\n\nPAPER under the above title, which was published in No. 9 of this Journal (June, 1882), contains a translation of the later portion of the Perak \"Salsila,\" (chain, genealogy) of the royal family. This ends abruptly with the death of Marhum Muda, which took place about the year 1777. It has been carried on and brought down to 1882 by Raja Haji Yahya, of Belanja, in Perak, whose manuscript I have translated. Ungku Haji's work does not profess to be more than a genealogical record, and is not, like the older book, a historical narrative of events. It has not, therefore, the interest of the latter. It is useful, however, as exhibiting the mode of succession which was customary among the Perak Rajas in former times, and as an authentic source from which to ascertain the relative purity of the descent of the surviving members of the royal line in that State.\n\nFor convenience of reference, the names and titles, wherever they occur, of the Rajas who at any time succeeded to the throne of Perak are printed in small capitals.\n\nW.

This Raja Sherif received the title of Sultan Muda Ala-eddin, and had, by Raja Sabda, two sons and one daughter, namely, Raja Ima and Raja Alang (often called Raja Alang Pulau), sons, and Raja Itam, daughter.\n\nRaja Alang had two children, of whom one was a daughter who has left a numerous posterity, namely, Rajah Ngah Amiah. Rajah Itam married a Saiyid from Trengganu of the Arab tribe Beni Yahya; they had two sons, namely, Raja Ngah Daha (Saiyid Hussein) and Raja Alang Hussein, commonly known as Raja Tua.\n\nWhile Marhum Kahar was Raja Muda, Raja Kemas had the title of Raja Kechik Muda, and when the former became Sultan the latter succeeded as Raja Muda. He eventually succeeded to the throne on the death of Marhum Kahar and took the title of Sultan Muhamadin Shah,* establishing himself at Pasir Pulai, to which place he gave the name of Pulau Besar Indra Mulia.

Before his time the title of Bandahara had been held by Chiefs not of royal blood. See Journal No. 2, p. 187.\ned the two girls in looking after his farm (ladang). One day an old woman came there and questioned them, and they explained how they were in a position of slavery in consequence of a debt of five dollars. The woman asked their names, and one of them replied: \"I am called Upik and my sister's name is Dewi.\" Then the old woman said: \"Open your mouth;\" she did so and the old woman spat into it * and touched Dewi in the waist. Then she said: \"I am Nenek Kemang,\" \u2020 and she gave them a tuai (an instrument for plucking padi-ears) and instructed them in the art of rice-cultivation and that is the origin of the knowledge of the cultivation of padi as it is practised in Kampar and Teja up to the present day.\u2021 (In the name of the God who knoweth!) The old woman said moreover: \"Do not be unhappy, it is no longer in the power of anyone to fasten on your skin and bones; your debt is at an end and ye are no longer slaves,\" she then vanished.\n\nWhen the harvest was over and the padi had been taken to the kampung, Raja Bandahara Peningat Itam came up the little river on the bank of which they lived and the people there told him of the exceptional beauty of Che Upik and Che Dewi. He immediately took both of them and they accompanied him down the river. He married Toh Upik, and she bore him a son who was called Raja Abdurrahman.\n\nAfter the death of Marhum Kahar, Raja Kemas became Raja \u00a7; Bandahara Peningat Itam became Raja Muda and Raja Cholan became Bandahara. After the death of Raja Kemas, he was known as Marhum Muda. Raja Muda Ala-eddin then became Raja under the title of Sultan Ala-eddin\n\n* This rather objectionable incident, or something like it, occurs in the legend of Badang in the Sajarah Malaya. It is found also in other Perak legends, e.g., that of Toh Kuala Bidor.\n\n\u2020 The legend of Nenek Kemang is ignorantly introduced here as an incident which occurred in the last century. It is an ancient legend which belongs to the pre-Islamic and pre-Malay times of the Malay nation, and in the folk-lore of Perak Malays the benevolent fairy or goddess is often referred to. Priah Nenek Kemang, \"the cooking-pot of Nenek Kemang\" (the contents of which could never be exhausted), is the \"widow's cruse\" of the Malay peasant.\n\n\u2021 As to the belief in a Ceres entertained by Indo-Chinese nations, see Col.

His daughters were called Raja Long Irang and Raja Chu, and his son was called Raja Kasim. The mother of the latter was Inche Mek Anjong; she was the daughter of the Sri Maharaja Lela, Toh Osman, of Kota Lama.\n\nThe Bandahara, Raja Inu, married a sister of Raja Muda Cholan, whose title was Raja Che Puan Tengah; she bore him two sons and one daughter, namely:\n\n1.\u2014Raja Abdurrahim, who married Raja Long Irang, the daughter of Raja Muda Cholan,\n2.\u2014Raja Radin, who married Raja Chu, younger sister of Raja Long Irang,\n3.\u2014Raja Itam.\n\nWhen Raja Muda Cholan died, he became known among the people as Marhum Pulau Jawar.\u2020 Raja Kasim was then still very young, and his sister Raja Long Irang brought him up. Raja Long Irang and her husband and child all died about the same time, the latter being quite young. Raja Bandahara Inu died soon afterwards and became known to posterity as Marhum Tengah.

The original Perak Sateela only carries the history as far as the previous reign (Journal No. 9, p. 107). All therefore that now follows is new.\n\n\u2020 Raja Cholan (Marhum Pulau Jawar) is famous in Perak as the author of the historical work Misa Malaya, which has been described in No. 2 of this Journal, p. 187, and extracts from which will be found in No. 10, p.p. 258, 263. I take this opportunity of correcting a mistake committed in the papers quoted, where Mial is written for Misa. There is a Javanese romance which has been translated into Malay and is very popular in Perak. It is called Hakayat Misa Perbujaya, or simply Misa Jawa. Raja Cholan's work has been compared by its admirers to the romance in question and has thus come to be called Misa Malaya. (The Malay Misa) in contradistinction to the Misa Jawa.\nRaja Muda, and Raja Kechik Muda Mahmud, the son of Marhum Muda, became Bandahara.\n\nSultan Ahamadin married four wives, namely, first Che Puteh, daughter of the Laksamana, Toh Kuala Bidor, by his wife Toh Puasa.

She had one son, Raja Inu. The king's third wife was a woman of Katiar named Inche Sri Nayan, daughter of Toh Imam Malik-al-Amin. (This Imam Malik-al-Amin was one of nine brothers, namely Toh Biji Dewa, Toh Saiah Dusun, Toh Lubok, Toh Bujal, Toh Sarambi\u2014these last two went to Aceh\u2014and three others. They were the sons of an Arab named Saiyid Aji by Toh Dusun binti Mrah Chuchik Puteh, an Achinese woman of royal blood). The king had one son by Che Sri Nayan, whom he called Raja Abdurrahman.

Raja Kechik Besar, Abdul Mulk, his son, then became Raja under the title of Sultan Mansur Shah, and Raja Abdullah, his son, became Raja Muda. The Bandahara, Raja Mahmud, also died. Raja Ngah Laut married Raja Aminah, and became Bandahara. Raja Abdurrahman received the title of Raja Kechik Besar and when he died at Kampong Mangkasar, people spoke of him as Marhum Kampung. Raja Kechik Besar married Che Limah, the sister of Toh Ludin, a native of Kuala Prai, daughter of Wan Bentan, who was the son of Tumonggong Pak Ujan, who first opened Kuala Prai.* Raja Kechik Besar and his wife Che Limah had one son, Raja Abdullah.

Raja Bandahara Radin married a woman of the lower class, a native of Kampong Chupin, Niela Ungu by name, and had by her a daughter named Raja Utih, and a son named Raja Ngah Putra. The Raja Bandahara took a second wife, Che Putch, a woman of Bandar, and had by her a son named Raja Ala-eddin. After the death of Raja Bandahara Radin, he was spoken of by the people by the titles of Marhum Kechik and Marhum Pulau. And Raja Che Puan Besar Aminah, sister of Sultan Abdullah, and wife of Raja Muda Ngah Laut, also died, and was called after her death by the title of Shafalam Muda.\nRaja Kechik Muda Cholan was the next Bandahara, and in his time an arrangement was got up among the Chiefs and Rajas and a European named\u2014by which the Raja Muda, Ngah Laut, was raised to the dignity of Yang-di-per-Tuan Muda, and Raja Bandahara Cholan was made Raja Muda, and Raja Abdullah, son of Marhum Kampong Mangkasar (Raja Kechik Besar Abdurrahman) changed his title for that of Raja Kechik Muda, and Raja Idris, son of Raja Ismail, changed his title for that of Raja Kechik Sulong.\n\nRaja Mandak, daughter of Marhum Bongsu, was given in marriage by her young relation Sultan Abdullah Ma'adam Shah to Raju Saiyid Itam, son of a Raja from Siak, who already had a son, named Raja Hussein, living at Larat.

Raja Muda Cholan now ascended the throne under the title of Sultan Shahabuddin Shahi, and Raja Bandahara Abdullah, son of Marhum Kampong Mangkasar, became Raja Muda, while Raja di Hilir Ngah J'Affar succeeded him as Raja Bandahara. Sultan Shahabuddin Shah died, and was known after his death as Marhum Tanjong Penanggar Safi-ullah. Raja Muda Abdullah then became Sultan, and reigned at Tanjong Sarangedang under the title of Sultan Abdullah Muhammad Shah. The Bandahara (Raja di Hilir) became Raja Muda, and Raja Alang Iskandar became Bandahara. The wife of Raja Muda Ngah J'Affar\nreceived the title of Raja Che Puan Besar, and the wife of Raja Bandahara Alang Iskandar, that of Raja Che Puan Kechil.\n\nThe Raja Bandahara by his wife Raja Che Puan Kechil had two children, the eldest of whom was a daughter named Raja Teh Kechik, and the second a son named Raja Hassan. He had another wife also, a woman of the lower class named Alang Milu, alias Ken Uda, by whom he had three sons:\n\n1. Raja Kulup Muhammad Kramat.\n2. Raja Idris.\n3. Raja Lop Ahamad.\n\nRaja Bandahara Alang Iskandar died at Kuala Teja, and has ever since been known by the people as Marhum Kuala Teja.\n\nSultan Abdullah Muhammad Shah by his wife Raja Perampuan Ngah Aminah had three sons and one daughter, namely:\n\n1. Raja Ngah Yusuf, (the present Regent).\n2. Raja Pandak.\n3. Raja Sulaiman.\n4. A daughter born after her father came to the throne, whose name was Raja Mandak and whose title was Raja Budak Rasul (anak bangta*).\n\nRaja Ismail Hitam, son of Raja Mandak, and grandson of Marhum Bongsu, married Raja Fatimah, daughter of Raja Kechik Besar Daud by his wife Long Halimah; and Raja Ngah Ali, son of Marhum Safi-ullah, was a close friend and ally of this Raja Ismail, for the latter had been adopted by Marhum Safi-ullah and his wife in their lifetime. When this Raja Ngah Ali lost his wife Raja Puteh, daughter of Raja Kechik Tengah, he married the daughter of Raja Kechik Sulong Idris; her name was Raja Puteh Zeleha. They had two sons:\n\n1. Raja Osman.\n2. Raja Omar.\n\nBefore they reached manhood, Raja Ngah Ali divorced (ber-cherei hidop) Puteh Zeleha.\n\n* Anak bangta or anak suloh is the name given in Perak to a child of a Sultan borne after his accession.\nRaja Ismail Hitam, by his wife Raja Fatimah, had two children, the elder of whom was a daughter, Raja Long Khadijah, and the second a son named Raja Lop Ahamad.\n\nWhen Sultan Abdullah Muhammad Shah died, Raja Muda Ngah J'Affar became Yang-di-per-tuan and took the title of Sultan J'Affar Ma'adam Shah. Raja Ali became Raja Muda and Raja Ismail became Raja Bandahara.\n\nSultan J'Affar and his wife Raja Kechik Puan Besar had one daughter named Raja Long. Her mother died before Raja J'Affar succeeded to the throne and was known after her death by the title of Sha'alum Telok Kapsayang Mangkat di Pangkulan Tengah. The Sultan had, by another wife (Che Bulan), a daughter named Raja Ngah, and, by another wife (Che Mahat), a daughter named Raja Nandak and a son named Raja Abdullah. This Raja Abdullah was born on the night of Nasfi Shababan, and it is said that on that night the water of the well Zem-zem bubbled up and overflowed. Further, a pious Menangkabau man, still living, named Haji Muhammad Ali (who is married to Che Fatimah of Bandar and is known as Tuan Besar Kramat) when he saw the new-born infant, said at the time: \"This child is supernaturally gifted (ber-tuah); take 'the greatest care of him.\"\n\nRaja Long, the Sultan's daughter, married Raja Kechik, the son of a Raja from Riau, and his second daughter, Raja Ngah, married Daing Perbu, the son of a Bugis Raja who was the son of Kraing Chandrapolih, son of the Raja of Bernih (Brunei): and his third daughter, Raja Nandak, married Raja Pandak, son of Marhum Atik-ullah Mangkat di Durian Sabatang, (Sultan Abdullah Muhammad Shah).\n\nRaja Abdullah, the son of Sultan J'Affar married Raja Tipah, half sister of Raja Muda Ngah Ali on the mother's side.\n\nSultan J'Affar married another wife called Che Alang Amas, who bore him a son called Raja Musah.\n\nRaja Long had three sons by her husband Raja Kechik of Riau, namely:\n\n1.\u2014Raja Mahmud, who is now at Riau and who has been to Meccah.\n2.\u2014Raja Ngah J'afar, who lives at Kampar at Kampong Changkat.\n\n3.\u2014Raja (hiatus in M.

Raja Muda Noah Ali then ascended the throne, and his title while Sultan was \"Al matukkal billah il jali Paduka Sri Sultan al muk-\" mel 'Anayat Shah el Perak dar el riqan.\"*\n\nRaja Abdullah, son of the late Sultan, became Raja Muda, the Bandahara, Raja Ismail Hitam, retained that office, and it was by his wish and consent that Raja Abdullah was made Raja Muda.\n\nRaja Osman, son of the new Sultan, married Raja Long Khadijah, daughter of Raja Bandahara Ismail, and had no issue.\n\nAfter the Sultan (Ali) had reigned for a time, he died at Kuala Manora at the house of Che Rajab, and was buried at Gedong Siam at Sayong. The title given to him after his death was Mahum Najl-ullah.\n\nAt this time, Raja Abdullah was down the river and though he was sent for repeatedly he did not come.\u2020 There was then a\n\n* \"He who places all his confidence in the just God, Paduka Sri Sultan el mukmal 'Anayat Shah of Perak, the abode of Paradise.\"\n\n\u2020 The custom quoted by the Perak Chiefs in explanation of their action in passing over the Raja Muda (see Blue-Book c. 1111, p. 118) is common to several Indo-Chinese nations, e.g. the Sinhalese, Janssens, Ind.

Not long after this, Raja Muda Abdullah came to an agreement with the Chiefs down the river, at the head of whom was the Laksamana Muhammad Amin, that he should be recognised as Sultan under the title of \"El 'ashik billah\u2020 Sultan Abdullah Muhammad Shau, Yang-di-per-Tuan, Perak,\" and he at once went to Singapore where Governor Ord was then stationed as the Governor of the Straits Settlements. Soon after he returned to Perak, there was a change of Governors and Sir Andrew Clarke became Governor and after reaching Singapore came on to Pangkor, where he confirmed Sultan Abdullah as Yang-di-per-Tuan of Perak, Sultan Ismail becoming Ex-Sultan, that is to say, Sultan Muda. The Colonial Secretary, Mr. J. W. Birch, was then appointed Resident of Perak. Again there was a change of Governors in Singapore, and Sir William Jervois became Governor. Then the death of Mr. Birch at Pasir Salak took place, and the Sultan (Ismail) retired from Pangkalan P\u00e8gulh. Then Captain Dunlop and Major McNair became Queen's Commissioners in Perak and afterwards Mr. Davidson became Resident. After this, Sultan Abdullah and the Laksamana and the Shabandar were taken away to Singapore and thence to Pulau Seychelles. Then Mr. Hugh Low became Resident of Perak and Mr. Maxwell became Assistant Resident and governed Larut. Raja Muda Yusuf became Regent of Perak, and Raja Idris, son of Marhum Bandahara Iskandar, became Hakim of Perak.\n\nRaja Muda Yusuf, Regent of Perak, begot two children, a daughter named Raja Nutih, and a son, Raja Lop Mansur.

Pryer, Von Donop, Frank Hatton and Wittl.\n\nArea.\n\nEmbracing an area of some 20,000 square miles, and a coast line of about 500 miles, the territory lies between the 116th and 119th degrees of East longitude, and the 4th and 7th parallels of North latitude.\n\nGeographical Features.\n\nThe general geographical features of the country are as follows:\u2014A range of mountains\u2014the general direction of which is North-East and South-West\u2014forms a backbone through the heart of the country, varying in height from 4,000, 7,000 and 8,000 feet in the mountains of Melaio, Mentapok and Trodan, respectively, until the altitude of 13,698 feet is attained by the rugged peaks of Kina Balu, which tower above the surrounding country, repelling with precipitous ascent the adventurer who would attain their summits. From this range and descending to the coast on either side, are lesser ranges of\n\n* See a paper, with this title, by Sir Walter Medhurst, read at a meeting of the Royal Colonial Institute this year.\u2014Ed.\nhills covered for the most part with virgin forest, and interspersed with fertile plains, watered by the numerous rivers which wind their circuitous courses to the sea beyond. The coast, as a rule, is low and flat and is, to a large extent, lined with the handsome casuarina tree, broken by stretches of mangrove, denoting swampy ground or the mouths of rivers, and diversified by low sandstone cliffs, yellow from exposure to the weather, or patches of forest reaching to the water's edge.\n\nAt a short distance from the shore on the West coast, a very large area of country is denuded of trees, and *lalang*, a coarse grass (*Andropogon caricosum*), has spread over it, except where here and there the plantations of the natives vary its monotony.\n\n**Harbours.**\n\nMany indentations occur on the coast, and the country is particularly rich in harbours, the principal being Gaya, Ambong and Usikan on the West coast, Kudat on the North, and Sandakan on the East. The importance of these harbours it needs but a glance at the map to realize, containing as they do, amongst other advantages, natural facilities for defence.\n\n**Sandakan.**\n\nSandakan harbour it will be seen, lies but a short distance from the track taken by trading vessels between Australia and China, and is indeed but five hours steaming distance from their course. It is extremely well protected, and contains anchorage for any number of vessels: having an extent of fifteen miles in length, by five miles in breadth.\n\n**Kudat and Gaya.**\n\nKudat and Gaya harbours are within a few hours steam of the route, through the Palawan passage, taken by ships trading from the West to China and Japan. The value of these harbours, therefore, as coaling stations, and refuges for our mercantile navy, in the event of a war with a naval power,\ncannot be overrated, and it follows, that it is of the highest importance that they should not be in the hands of any foreign and possibly hostile power.\n\nThe value of these harbours, in addition to their strategical importance, is enhanced by the rich country lying at their back. This is especially the case with regard to Sandakan, into which flow some fifteen rivers, taking their courses, for the most part, through a country which is without doubt a field for large sugar and tobacco plantations, and containing a supply of timber which, from its easy access, should be a great source of revenue to the Government.\n\nRivers.\n\nThe principal rivers in the territory are the Kimanis, Papar, Putatan, Abai, and Tampasuk, on the West Coast, Patan and Sugut on the North, and Sibuco and Kinabatangan on the East. Most of these rivers are navigable for steam launches of light draught, for although, as a rule, deep water is found inside the entrance, all the rivers are more or less barred. The Kinabatangan is navigable for some 200 miles. Rising in the ranges south of Kina Balu, it takes its course to the sea, emerging some twenty miles south of Sandakan harbour, after passing through a very thinly populated country covered for the most part with virgin forest, varied by occasional native plantations, or patches of secondary jungle denoting where former clearings have been. The quantity of floating timber met with, in the rivers, renders careful navigation necessary.\n\nNorth Borneo as a field for the Planter.\n\nNorth Borneo as a new field for the crowded-out planters of Ceylon and Sumatra, is not to be surpassed, for in its hills and valleys will be found soil suitable to almost every tropical product. Hapton in the New Ceylon writes as follows, and his remarks are confirmed by experts from personal observations:\u2014\n\n\"The spurs and slopes of Kina Balu are peculiarly fitted for growing coffee, tea and cinchona, while the rich plains that\nmark the course of the Kinabatangan and other rivers lend themselves to the culture of indigo, tobacco, cotton, rice and the other well-known tropical products. Such villages as the traveller meets with on excursions in the interior, are fed and maintained by agriculture, the successful features of which, belong to the natural fertility of the soil, rather than to the science of the native farmer. . . . You cross a plain of rice, bananas, cocoa-nut trees and other luxuriant vegetation. You see the native cultivator at work, his rude plough drawn by buffaloes, and flocks of white paddy birds sailing aloft, or a few solitary cranes adding an oriental touch to the picture. You halt on the river bank amidst tropical groves, here and there relieved by neatly kept gardens, fenced down to the water's edge, and containing plentiful supplies of sweet potatoes, cucumbers, maize and kaludi.\"\n\nTobacco.\n\nThat the country is peculiarly adapted for the growth of tobacco, is demonstrated by the fact of its cultivation by the natives of both coasts, and that in spite of the want of care in its production, an excellent leaf is obtained. A sample of leaf from a newly opened plantation on the East Coast, has been pronounced by experts to be unsurpassed. Such being the case, and considering that the available land in the tobacco producing countries is becoming exhausted, it is reasonable to suppose that this country will, in a short time, take a prominent place as a large producer of tobacco.\n\nSugar.\n\nSugar is also cultivated to some extent and in some parts of the country; a primitive mill for crushing is used by the natives. Considering, however, the small profit returned, together with the known risks in cultivation, the substitutes for cane which are being brought into the market, and the comparatively low rate at which labour is obtained in the sugar producing countries, it is doubtful whether this product will be cultivated to any large extent.\nGambier.\n\nGambier (the inspissated juice of *Nauclea gambir*, an astringent used in dying and tanning), the cultivation of which has met with such success in the neighbouring state of Sarawak, pepper, tea and *coffee arabica*, have all been proved suitable, and sago which is indigenous to the country would largely repay for planting in the low lying grounds at the entrances to rivers.\n\nJungle Products.\n\nEspecially is this country rich in natural jungle products, such as gutta percha, india rubber, camphor, canes, and an infinite variety of useful and ornamental woods, including the valuable bilian (iron-wood) and ebony.\n\nCamphor\n\nThe camphor of Borneo, (*Dryobalanops camphora*) is noted for its peculiar medicinal properties, and is highly valued by the Chinese, who will give, according to the variation of the market, from twenty to forty dollars a pound for the best.\n\nBorneo, with its natural advantages in waterways, should export its timber largely to China, and no doubt when labour becomes more abundant, this will be the case.\n\nFirewood.\n\nA market for firewood has been already established in Hongkong, and the supply of mangrove which is unequalled for this purpose, is practically inexhaustible, and can be obtained without any difficulty. The bark of this tree, which has to be removed in its preparation as firewood, has its own special value as producing a reddish dye much used by the Chinese.\n\nEdible Birds' Nests.\n\nAnother valuable and increasing product is the edible\nbirds' nest, which is obtained in small quantities on the West coast, and adjacent islands, but is chiefly supplied from the Gomanton caves on the East coast. The following description of these caves is condensed from an account lately published in the Straits Times. The caves are situate on the Kinabatangan river, near the village of Malapi, which is some fifty miles from the mouth. The chief entrance Simud putih (white entrance) is on the Gomanton hill at an elevation of 500 feet, and is about 30 feet high by 50 feet wide. The ascent to it is very steep, in some parts almost perpendicular, but the nature of the jagged hard lime-stone rocks, affords holding points for one's hands and feet. From this entrance the ascent to the summit of the hill, is another 500 feet, and at the top is a smallish hole which leads into the great Simud putih caves below, going straight down about 850 feet. Down this the natives descend by rattan ladders, fastened to the circumference of the hole, right into the abyss below, in search of the nests. At nightfall a remarkable sight is to be seen at the entrance, viz., the return of the swallows (Collocalia esculenta) to their nests, and the departure of the bats. With a whirring sound, multitudes of bats wheel round in spiral columns from the summit of which detachments break off and wheel away rapidly towards the mangrove swamps and the nipa palms. Amongst them the white bats are very conspicuous, and are termed by the natives, the Rajah, his wife and child. Soon after the bats emerge from the caves, the swallows return in countless numbers. Each morning the process is reversed, the swallows going out and the bats returning home. On entering the mouth of the cave as described above, the floor for the first part of the way slopes down at an angle of twenty-five degrees, to an enormous cave with several smaller ones leading out of it. From the side of this cave rises a high dome, from the top of which you can see the opening before-mentioned, some 850 above. The average height of the cave before coming to the dome is 150 feet. The next cave Simud itam (black entrance) is on a level with the river bank. The entrance is by a magnificent porch of 250 feet in height, opening out into a large and lofty chamber, beyond which an open space is reached, from which looking up can be seen the Simud putih.\nFrom this space is a cave running under the Semud series which is filled, halfway to the top with bats' guano, which cannot be less than fifty feet in depth. Its extent is unknown. Samples of the guano have been sent home and were valued at from \u00a38 to \u00a315 per ton. The annual value taken from these caves is \u00a325,000.\n\nCoal.\n\nThat coal is present in many parts of the territory, has been proved, and boring for workable deposits, is being actively engaged in. The present supply, which is stored at the principal ports of call, for the use of men-of-war and trading vessels, is obtained from the Moara mines, situated at the mouth of the Brunei River and which have been leased by the Sultan of Brunei to the Labuan firm of Messrs. Cowie Brothers. The quality of the coal has been well reported upon by engineers of Her Majesty's ships and others, and it is used to a large extent by those vessels visiting Borneo and Labuan, as well as by all the local trading steamers. There are five seams now being worked, of 26, 24, 6, 5 and 4 feet in thickness respectively.\n\nMinerals.\n\nFrom the reports of travellers and others, the mineral wealth of Borneo has been much exaggerated, although the numerous indications are sufficient to have caused them. Gold indeed is found in Dutch Borneo and Sarawak, but in comparatively small quantities. Traces of gold have also been found in North Borneo, and the island of Bangucy off the North coast, and samples of auriferous quartz have lately been discovered in the vicinity of Marudu Bay and in rivers flowing into Sandakan Bay. Up to the present, however, the search has been unsuccessful, and this is not to be wondered at, when we consider how everything is hidden by a luxuriant vegetation which jealously guards the treasures of the earth from the eyes of the explorer. Samples of cinnabar, silver ore, antimony and tin have been found in different parts of the territory. Copper also was being traced by the late Mr. Frank Hatton, the Company's mineralogist, who was confident of its existence.\nbut his lamented and sad death has temporarily put a stop to the search for it. The same formations in which the silver ore and antimony are found in Sarawak, are also met with in parts of North Borneo, and from specimens which have been brought in by the natives, it is reasonable to suppose that a systematic search would disclose workable deposits.\n\n**Mother-o'pearl.**\n\nThe sea also has treasures which form no small item of export, such as mother-o'pearl, b\u00eache-de-mer (*holothuria*), and tortoise shell. The neighbouring oyster beds in the Sulu sea have lately been attracting the attention of Europeans, with a view to the introduction of proper appliances for the effective working of the beds, which is impossible with the primitive means employed by the natives. There is no doubt that as the European government becomes known and appreciated, the pearl oyster beds, which unquestionably exist round the coasts, will be made to yield their riches. The grasping natures of the innumerable petty chiefs of a former r\u00e9gime, who oppressed the unfortunate pearl fishers, until their occupation\u2014arduous and dangerous as it was\u2014brought them no profit, is the cause assigned by the old men for the abandonment of the pursuit, and the consequent losing sight of the exact locality of the beds. On one occasion, whilst searching for an oyster bed in a locality pointed out by an old man living on one of the small islands off the coast, the divers who accompanied the writer, obtained over a hundredweight of mother-o'pearl, valued at $45, but all the shells were isolated, and it was evident that only the outlying members of the true bed had been found.\n\n**Fauna.**\n\nBeasts of prey are conspicuous by their absence, the one known exception being a small tree tiger (*Felis macrocelis*) which is found in the interior. Deer of various kinds, wild pigs, wild cattle (*Bos gaurus*), and buffalo, are abundant, and\nafford capital sport, whilst on the East coast are found in addition the elephant and rhinoceros (R. sumatrensis). Journeying up the rivers, many varieties of the zucker tribe are met with, including a small species of long-tail. Small black bears (Helarctos cryopterus) are occasionally met with. The tapir and other have been seen on the North coast. A large variety of squirrels abound. Amongst the snakes are found the cobra, python, and leaf snake (Trachycephalus telescopus), but the writer has not known a single fatal case of snake-bite during a residence of six years in Borneo.\n\nCrocodiles are numerous, and at times extremely fierce and dangerous. The rivers and coast teem with fish, which form the staple food of a large portion of the inhabitants.\n\nPigeons of many kinds, snipe, curlew and plover, the Argus and Bulwer pheasants (Argusianus Grayii and Lophophorus Bulweri; \u2020) and several kinds of partridge afford a tempting variety to the sportsman, and the field opened up to the naturalist amongst the numerous birds of North Borneo, is a large and but little known one.\n\nClimate.\n\nThe climate is more healthy than might be expected in a country situated so near the Equator. The maximum monthly mean temperature during the year 1883 was 83.9, whilst the lowest for the same period was 75.1. The nights as a rule are very cool and pleasant, and on the coast the heat during the day is rarely oppressive. The rainfall for 1883, as observed at Kudat, on the North coast, was 123.56 inches, November, December and January being the months during which most rain fell. There is no absolutely dry season, it being rare to pass many days without rain. To Europeans who take reasonable precautions against exposure to malarial influences, the climate is healthy.\n\n* Sir Stamford Raffles described the Malayan bear before the Linnean Society in 1820. Crawfurd says that the Bornean and Sumatran bears are the same species.\u2014Ed.\n\n\u2020 This is an error. The Bulwer Pheasant (Lophophorus Bulweri) has not come under the knowledge of the author. The birds referred to are two species of the Fireback Pheasant, the Euplocamus pyrrhonotus and the Euplocamus nobilis.\nPopulation.\n\nNorth Borneo is very thinly populated and its scattered inhabitants include many different races.\n\nThe West coast is principally peopled by a mixture of Malays, Bajaus and Ibanuns, whilst on the North and East coasts Bajaus and Sulus are chiefly met with. The aborigines who reside in the interior are called Dusuns or Ida'au. They are an agricultural race, and generally peaceful. They grow tobacco and cotton, as well as rice, tapioca, yams and Indian corn, but only cultivate sufficient for their own immediate use\u2014the usual habit of most natives of these parts, who fail to realize the importance of providing for the future. They use a plough and harrow, and in this respect are superior to the other natives of Borneo, although the use of these implements is said to have been introduced by the Chinese who\u2014report tells us\u2014at some remote period thickly populated North Borneo.\n\nLabour.\n\nFor purposes of labour, the native cannot be depended upon, being naturally indolent and quite content so long as his own immediate wants are satisfied, and these being simple, he finds no difficulty in supplying them. Chinese at present supply the labour market. Chinese, natives of India, and Arabs are to be found trading in most of the rivers, and the first named are settling in large numbers wherever stations have been opened by the Company, more especially at Sandakan, which now contains some 3,000.\n\nA rough estimate of the population gives the number as 150,000, but this is probably underrated, as it is being rapidly increased by the influx of Chinese. The value of the Chinese in a new country like this, is well known, and as a pioneer, his assistance in making the Government known to the natives of the interior, amongst whom he intrepidly ventures, alone or with but one or two companions, speaking imperfectly if at all their language, will be readily acknowledged by those who have experienced it.\nSlavery.\n\nOne great benefit which will follow on the establishment of a Government by Europeans, will be the gradual abolition of slavery, which, however mild it may be in this country, is repugnant to civilised humanity. By recent laws promulgated by the Government, the death blow to the various modes of obtaining slaves has been struck, the following regulations effectually accomplishing this object:\u2014(1.) No slaves can be imported from other countries. (2.) Debtors cannot be seized by their creditors, which was formerly one of the principal means of obtaining slaves. (3.) All children born of slave parents after November, 1883, and who would, according to custom, be slaves also, are declared free.\n\nMost of the inhabitants of the coast are Mahomedans, whilst the aborigines put their faith in omens and old superstitions.\n\nFuture Prospects.\n\nIn conclusion, the experiment in colonization now being tried by the British North Borneo Company, is one of more than local importance, and is being anxiously watched by other nations whose interests in those seas are so great.\n\nWith the example of what has been done in the Native States, and Sarawak, and by governing through and with the assistance of the natives themselves\u2014which is indeed the only true way in a country such as this\u2014the young colony should, within a reasonable time, realize the expectations it has aroused, by taking a position corresponding to its natural advantages, and sending forth its riches to the other countries of the world.*\n\nE. P. GUERITZ.\n\n[This paper was prepared at the suggestion of Mr. J. S. O'Halloran, Secretary of the Royal Colonial Institute, by whom it was read, on my behalf, at the Montreal Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, on the 29th August, 1884.\u2014E. P. G.]\n\n* The information in this paper may be fitly supplemented by the following\nremarks made by Mr. A. Dent when Sir Walter Medhurst's paper on British North Borneo was read before the Royal Colonial Institute on the 12th May, 1885:\u2014 \"The progress in North Borneo has not been so rapid as was anticipated when we obtained the charter at the end of 1881, but still we certainly point to steady progress since the company took possession in July, 1882. I find that the fiscal revenue for 1883 as compared with 1883 shows an increase of 60 per cent; land sales a decrease of 39 per cent, bringing a total increase of 2% per cent., which, considering the state of trade and universal depression, must, I think be thought a wholly unsatisfactory. Sir Walter has alluded to several new imports and exports. We hope in 1885 to show an export of gold. Last autumn we sent one of our best officers to explore for gold in the Segama and Kinabatangan rivers, and his report showed gold to exist in alluvial deposits in the 30 or 40 places experimented upon. He could not continue his explorations owing to the wet season having just set in, but has recently gone back, and we hope soon to hear it confirmed that there are workable deposits of gold in the country. That the Governor and officials of North Borneo believe in it is evidenced by their having taken the trouble to publish regulations and proclaim certain districts as gold fields. Tobacco we look forward to as likely to prove an important enterprise in the country. This, as the paper says, is advancing but slowly, for, owing to many difficulties which occur in a new country, the 1884 crop did not come up to expectations. Considerable preparations have, however, been made for planting during the coming season. In February last one company had 330 coolies working on their plantation, and another company 100 coolies. From all accounts, this tobacco is likely to prove equal to the finest Sumatra. It is used for covering purposes. In sugar little has been done as yet, but large tracts of country have been taken by Australians, Chinese, and others. There seems to be a fair prospect that the depression in this trade will soon pass away, for prices have recently advanced 30 per cent. There is some reason to believe that the German Government are getting tired of the system of boycotts, for I believe it is a fact that the sugar manufacturers and growers of beetroot in Germany urge the Government somewhat like ten million sterling, and the authorities are beginning to wonder whether they will ever get their money again. As regards timber, our export for 1884 amounted to $10,000. Part went to Australia and part of China. There is a great variety of timber in Borneo, some of the hardest woods in the world being found there. The Billian, or iron wood, is plentiful, and valuable for railway sleepers, wharves, &c.; and some other woods are suited for furniture, ship-building, and other purposes. One of the Chinese merchants has 200 men cutting timber for the China market, and the Australians are cutting tim freely for the Melbourne market. The report upon the experimental garden at Silam states that Liberian coffee, now rising to its third year, is very fine, and yielding freely. The younger plantations at Sandakan promise well. The growth of pepper is all that could be desired. Cocoa, Manila hemp, and gambira are, amongst other articles, easily produced in the territory. One of the main questions remaining for consideration is that of labour. Everywhere the question seems to be how, and where, to get labour. Many restrictions are, we know, put upon the importing of Chinese into America and Australia,\nbut those who have lived as long as I have amongst the Chinese will testify to their value if they are treated properly. One advantage with this labour is that you can make contracts, and payment by results, by which means you can get the maximum amount of labour at the minimum of expense. Borneo is but a few days' steam from China and Singapore, where, for a moderate wage, an unlimited amount of this labour can be obtained. Anyone who has studied the map will, I think, recognise that, commercially and strategically, North Borneo occupies a position of great importance. Lying on the high road between China and Australia, we must in time get a large population there. The climate I can speak well of. I have lived there many months at different times of the year. The Government of the country is based as Sir William MacKenzie says, on the adhesion of the administration to meet the wishes of the natives and the Chinese, and the other settlers. A force of 180 police has hitherto been sufficient to keep order with comparative ease. As to the charter, some friends of the enterprise seem to believe that the enormous powers we hold were given by Her Majesty the Queen. It is not so at all. All our powers were derived entirely from the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu, and what the British Government did was simply to incorporate us by Royal charter, thus recognising our powers, which recognition is to us, of course, of vital importance. I hope I have said enough to interest you in our scheme, and to show that North Borneo has a considerable future before it.\"\n\nEd.\nJELEBU.\n\nThe following Notes, regarding the history of the constitution of Jelebu have been compiled from information gleaned from the headmen of the State.*\n\nThe four following countries\u2014(1) Jelebu, (2) Sungei Ujong, (3) Rembau, and (4) Johol\u2014were in former days governed by Penghulus subject to the suzerainty of Johor.\n\nOn one occasion the Raja of Johor was guilty of an act of gross oppression towards the Penghulu of Rembau entitled Orang Kaya Kechil. The Raja of Johor wished to obtain in marriage this Penghulu's daughter, but the Penghulu refused and married her to another. The Raja's anger was roused at this, and the Penghulu, hearing of his indignation sent his own son Si\u0101mat (sic) to explain matters to the Raja and to endeavour to appease his wrath.\n\nThe Raja, however, would not listen to Si\u0101mat, but ordered him to be put to death.\n\nAfter this the Penghulus of the four States were afraid to go to the Court of the Raja, owing to this unjust act.\n\nAfter some time, however, the headman of Jelebu took courage to appear before him. Now this headman's name was Munyong Salih, and his title was Orang Kaya of Sungei Lumut. The name of Jelebu was as yet unknown; and it was not until some time later that the country was so called after a man of that name who was drowned in the river (Triang). This headman of Jelebu, then, went to the Court of the Raja of Johor, who presented him with a chop bearing the following inscription:\u2014\n\n\"The Sultan Ma'adam Shah confers upon the Mandelika\n\"Mantri supreme authority to be the Sultan of Jelebu\n\"for ever.\"\n\n* The first division of this paper is, I need hardly point out, a literal translation of the story verbally communicated to me by Malays.\u2014H. A. O'B.\nAnd this is the form of words that has been used from generation to generation by the Penghulus who have governed the country of Jelebu.\n\nThe Raja of Johor further issued instructions to the Penghulu, that from that time forth the Penghulus of Jelebu and of the other three States were not to bring their complaints before Johor.\n\nThereupon the four Penghulus made an arrangement to create a Raja of their own, and chose a man of the royal blood of Menangkabau, who on his election abode in the country of Sri Menanti.\n\nThe place where the election of this Raja occurred was Petajeh, and hence arises the old Malay saying: \"The source of royal power is Petajeh; the place where it dwells is Sri Menanti.\" A Yam Tuan Muda in Rembau, and a Yam Tuan Besar in Sri Menanti, such was the (new) order of things, and the four Penghulus no longer took their complaints to Johor, but to Sri Menanti, and had thus a Menangkabau man as their ruler.\n\nAt that time there was no Yam Tuan in Jelebu, but the Penghulu held sway in that country, and this state of things continued for a long time.\n\nAt length the Yam Tuan of Sri Menanti, who had a number of sons, sent one of them to Jelebu, merely to take up his abode there and to till the ground. His conduct was long watched by all the officers of Jelebu, and they saw that it was very good. His behaviour towards the people was good, and he seemed to be a man capable of supporting and sustaining the country. He was also a man of considerable mental ability, and his personal character was beyond reproach.\n\nAccordingly all the officers met together and notified to the Penghulu their intention* of making the Yam Tuan's (Sri Menanti) son their supreme ruler.\n\nHe was accordingly elected with the title of Yam Tuan of Jelebu, with the duties of protector of the inhabitants of that country. He did not, however, receive any jurisdiction in the country, and the Penghulu and the officers contributed to his support, each man as much as he could afford.\n\n* This account of the attitude of the Waits and Lembagas in these early times is noteworthy as bearing upon the present constitution of the country.\nThe district within which the Yam Tuan's authority extended was from Bandar Berangan up to Sungei Melentang, that is to say, to Batu Gominting (in other words, a portion of what is now Klawang).\n\nSuch was the limit of his private and direct rule from that time down to the time of his descendant at the present day.\n\nAnd should he violate this understanding or the customs of the country he may be deposed by his officers.\n\n\"If a king be just he is reverenced if unjust checked.\"*\n\nSuch was the order of things in former times, and the boundary of Jelebu with Pahang is the place called Meranti Sembilan, \u2020 while the boundary with Sungei Ujong is Bukit Tangga.\n\nNow Klawang is said to belong to Sungei Ujong for the following reasons.\n\nSome time ago a son of the Datu Penghulu of Jelebu violated a daughter of the Penghulu of Klambu, and was compelled to marry her. Sufficient money to pay the fine exacted was not forthcoming, and so in place of a money payment the Penghulu of Jelebu gave Klawang (to Sungei Ujong), that is to say, so much of it as is on the right as one goes up stream to Sungei Ujong and down stream so far as Lubok Kerbau Balir. For any measure that the Yam Tuan wishes to take in the district thus defined, he must first obtain the sanction of the Government of Sungei Ujong.\n\nSuch is the account of the origin of the present Government which obtains in Jelebu, taken from the lips of those who are most likely to be informed on the subject and who are unanimous in their story.\n\nI may append a short account of the constitution of Jelebu as I found it when I visited it about the middle of the present\n\n* The headmen hold that the present Yam Tuan has violated the constitution, and he now resides in Klawang, with an allowance from the British Government contingent upon his non-interference in the government of Jelebu.\n\n\u2020 This appears to have been the old Jakun boundary. It is low down on the Triang river, is decidedly Pahang in its tendencies, and does not acknowledge the Penghulu.\nyear (1884) and in what follows, for the purposes of simplicity, I venture to leave out of consideration the recent arrangements made with the rulers of Jelebu.\n\nThere is still a Yam Tuan of Jelebu* although practically he may be regarded as a cipher. He arrogated to himself powers of interference in the internal government of the country, which the Penghulu and the Waris considered to be a violation of the conditions under which the office of Yam Tuan was established, and he was ordered by them in 1880 to leave Jelebu and reside in Sri Menanti. A composition was, however, effected in his behalf, and he now resides in Klawang near the Jelebu frontier. Theoretically he still continues to be the Protector of the people, but I have not learnt that any point has been referred to him since his removal from the country, except in the case of an informal grant of land recently made to an European company in Jelebu, and again in the case of the Pahang boundary question, when he expressed his opinion to the Government at my request.\n\nThe Penghulu, therefore, Syed Ali bin Zin, is the ruler of the country, for all practical purposes. I may say the undisputed ruler, as the Yam Tuan signed a bond in January of the present year undertaking not again to interfere in the government of the State.\n\nThe Penghulu is assisted in the conduct of affairs by nine officers, or perhaps it would be more correct to describe his jurisdiction as limited by them. They are entitled Lembagas, of whom there are five, and Waris, who are four in number. The Lembagas have each a separate title:\n\n1.\u2014Datu Mantri.\n2.\u2014Datu Ngiang.\n3.\u2014Datu Chinchang.\n4.\u2014Datu Sendara.\n5.\u2014Datu Lela Angsa.\n\nThese officers are all entitled to a vote in every act of State, and any act done without their concurrence is illegal. At the State Council, however, they may, in case of illness and so on, be represented by authenticated Wakils. The entire land of Jelebu is considered to be vested in them and the Waris, but under no circumstances can a Lembaga rise to the office of Penghulu.\n\n* Since deceased\u201413th December, 1884.\u2014Ed.\nThe *Waris* are entitled as follows:\n\n1. Raja Balang.\n2. Maharaja Indah.\n3. Raja Penghulu.\n4. Datu Umbei.\n\nThey also have a vote in the State Council, and the Penghulu is elected from their body with two reservations.\n\nThe Datu Umbei cannot become Penghulu, nor can the Raja Penghulu. A member of the family of the latter officer may, however, become a candidate for election.\n\nThe succession would appear to follow a fixed rule, viz., that on the death of a Penghulu who has been of the family of a Raja Penghulu, the Raja Balang of the day is elected. At his death the Maharaja Ludah of the day succeeds, and is again succeeded as Penghulu by a member of the family of the Raja Penghulu.\n\nThis rule is theoretically absolute, but has often been broken through, and in all cases the appointment must be ratified by the unanimous vote of the Lembagas.\n\nThe Datu Mantri is the head of the Lembagas, with the full title of \"Datu Mantri Shah Menangku Alam.\" The full title of the Datu Umbei (father of the Waris) is \"Datu Umbei Pangkal Maharaja Lela.\"\n\nAccording to old custom, the Datu Lela Angsa was appointed by the Penghulu to protect the Yam Tuan, and the Penghulu when he wished to obtain an audience of the Yam Tuan applied to do so to the Datu Mantri, who laid the request before the Datu Lela Angsa.\n\nThe Yam Tuan has, however, no followers now, with the exception of an ex-Maharaja Indah, who was deposed for supporting him in acts of oppression, and who resides with him in Klauang. Similarly in former days the Yam Tuan had four officers attached to his household, who now exist no longer. Their titles were:\n\n1. Bruang Sati who was chosen by the Datu Sendara.\n2. Penglima Prang, Datu Mantri.\n3. Penglima Mamat, Datu Chinchang.\n4. Penglima Prang No. 2, Datu Ngiang.\n\nThe Lembagas had thus a direct control over the internal\naffairs of the Yam Tuan's household, but, as I have said, all this is at an end now.\n\nThe Penghulu has four officers attached to his person, who are in like manner appointed and removed by the Waris.\n\n1\u2014Penglima Garang is chosen by the Datu Mantri.\n2\u2014Penglima Hitam, Datu Ngjang.\n3\u2014Penglima Sutan No. 1, Datu Chinchang.\n4\u2014Penglima Sutan No. 2, Datu Sendara.\n\nThe Penghulu, though in theory above control, is in reality entirely under the direction of the Lembagas and Waris, who, if unanimous, can obtain any constitutional change in the country they may desire by observing the following routine.\n\nIf a measure is originated at the unanimous desire of the Lembagas, it is submitted by them to the Waris, and vice versa. Should it obtain the concurrence of the party which is not its originator, it is submitted in due form to the Penghulu, who has the power of veto, but who in practice accepts what is laid before him with but little discussion. After this step has been taken, the measure (until recently) is transmitted to the Yam Tuan for final ratification, and when this has been obtained, the measure becomes law, binding upon the inhabitants of the country generally.\n\nThis process may appear to be rather too involved to work without friction in a Malay State, but there can be no doubt but that it contains elements of safety for the ryot from its very complexity.\n\nThe ex-Raja Balang left Jelebu and has reappeared with the Pahang envoy supporting his theory that Jelebu has always been Pahang territory, and that Jelebu as a separate State is non-existent.*\n\nWhatever may be the real status of Jelebu, the present condition of the country is truly deplorable. It bears marks of having been, at no very distant period, fairly prosperous and sufficiently peopled, but now, speaking generally, the whole land is waste.\n\nI passed the other day through mile after mile of deserted kampungs with fine padi land all round in abundance and with fruit-trees still in bearing.\n\nThe only sign of work or prosperity I came across was at\n\n* See the postscript.\nJelebu.\n\nSome tin mines at Jelundong, which have been worked on a small scale for 17 years by a Sungei Ujong Chinaman.\n\nThe tin deposit at this spot is the richest I have seen, being quite 100 per cent. better than in any mine at present working in Sungei Ujong, but even with this natural advantage the miner's struggle for existence is a very hard one. He is dependent for every mouthful of food upon Pahang or Sungei Ujong, and rice delivered at the mines is costly food indeed. When I was there, a dollar purchased only 2\u00bd gantangs of rice, as against 7 gantangs in Sungei Ujong, and 10 gantangs at Kuala Triang.\n\nAn arrangement has been entered into by which a bridletrack will be constructed from Pantei in Sungei Ujong to these mines early in the coming year, and other roads will be made later on. A shop in connection with the mines will be opened next year, so that I hope that they may progress as they ought to do.\n\nWith regard to the country generally, I see nothing in the way of its prosperity but the absence of population, and people are sure to come in when the proposed roads have become an established fact.\n\nH. A. O'Brien.\n\nP. S.\u2014At the present time (September, 1885) the road alluded to above has been completed, and a Collector (Mr. E. P. Guerra) has been appointed, who took up his duties in June last. I understand that the old residents are gradually returning to the country, and that there is every prospect of an early development of the mineral resources of the State.\n\nThe Pahang boundary has been definitely fixed at Sungei Dua on the Triang, and the Collector's quarters, together with a Custom House, Court, and Police Station, have been erected at Kuala Klawang.\n\nH. A. O'B.\nOCCASIONAL NOTES.\n\nLATA.\n\nThe following extract will be of great interest to those who have read Mr. O'Brien's paper on this subject in No. 11 of this Journal.\u2014Ed.\n\n\"The first thing of interest to attract me within a few hours of my arrival at Kosala, was a case in one of the servants of the house of that curious cerebral affection called by the natives lata. It is of a hysterical nature, and is confined chiefly to women, although I have also seen a man affected by it. On being startled, or excited suddenly, the person becomes lata, losing the control of her will, and cannot refrain from imitating whatever she may hear or see done, and will keep calling out, as long as the fit lasts, the name\u2014and generally that word alone\u2014of whatever has flashed through her mind as the cause of it. \"He-ih-heh matjan!\" (tiger); \"He-ih-heh boorung besar!\" (a great bird). Her purpose will be arrested, as, if walking, she will stop short, and on going on again will often follow some other course. The prefatory exclamation is an invariable symptom, seemingly caused by involuntary hysterical inspirations. According to the degree of alarm the symptoms may remain only a few moments, or last for the greater part of a day, especially if the patient be prevented from calming down. The afflicted, if not very seriously affected, are not altogether incapacitated from performing the duties to which they are accustomed. The most curious characteristic of the disease is their imitation of every action they see. On one occasion, while eating a banana, I suddenly met this servant with a piece of soap in her hand: and, perceiving she was slightly lata, but without appearing to take any notice of her, I made a vigorous bite at the fruit in passing her, an action she instantly repeated on the piece of soap.

Shipped on board the Alert, lent by the Resident Councillor of Penang, and started for Pangkor at 11.15 p.m. The launch Constance had been sent on to Bernam the previous day with a guard, and the Kinta being disabled, it would have been impossible to start without the Alert.\n\nSaturday, 11th April.\u2014Arrived at Pangkor at 6 a.m. Mr. Dew, the Acting Superintendent, came on board. Went ashore with Major Walker and Mr. Lister, and inspected the buildings. We left Pangkor at 2 p.m., and anchored inside the Bernam River at 6.30 p.m.\n\nSunday, 12th April.\u2014Under weigh at 4 a.m., and reached Saba at 6.30 a.m. Mr. Jones and Rajas Indut and Bidin came on board. Mr. Jones told us Mr. Hewett had gone on to Telok Mahang with the Constance and boats. Inspected the Police Station. I cannot understand the boldness of 12 Chinese robbers in attacking the station and village. There must have been at least thirty people actually on the spot in the shops between the farm and the station. Went down to Raja Indut's house with him. The cholera is decreasing. Two people died yesterday, and there have been 120 deaths since the outbreak of the disease. Left Saba at 8.30 a.m. and steamed up river to Telok Mahang. Here we met Mr. Hewett with the Constance at 3 p.m., and after two hours' further steaming arrived at Changkat Bertam, where we camped for the night, sleeping in the boats.\n\nMonday, 13th April.\u2014At daylight Walker and Hewett returned down river in the Constance, and we, having got all our baggage into eleven river-boats the previous evening,\nbegan rowing up-stream. Breakfasted on the river bank at noon, and getting into the great Bernam swamp camped for the night at Duh\u00e0 Rul the entrance to the final cutting. The banks were so low and wet we did not land, and the dew was excessive. This is where the fever was so bad when Mr. J. B. M. Leech was cutting the canals. One of the boatmen sick.\n\nTuesday, 14th April.\u2014Started at daylight, having poled from midday yesterday. Stopped for breakfast at 12.30 p.m. The river here is most lovely, but the district is quite uninhabited and uncleared. The upper reaches of the Bernam are wonderful in the beauty and variety of water and foliage. It turns out that our sick boatman has cholera. I gave him some cholera medicine, but he was so frightened that it had no effect; we did what we could for him, and at his request sent him back in a boat. At 2 p.m. continued our journey and reached Kuala Slim at 6 p.m., where we found Mr. Butler (the Acting Magistrate) with 39 Sakeis and 80 Malays to carry our baggage. The Bernam river, by the construction of seven miles of canal, could be shortened by about 57 miles of its present length, but those canals must be both deep and wide if they are to be useful at all times of the year and at all stages of the tide, and the question is whether the expenditure necessary for such a work is at present justifiable. The influence of the tide is felt for 80 miles from the mouth of the river.\n\nKuala Slim is 120 miles from the mouth of the Bernam river by the present channel.\n\nWednesday, 15th April.\u2014At 7 a.m., 77\u00b0 Fahrenheit, the aneroid shewed Kuala Slim to be 120 feet above sea level.\n\nHaving loaded the coolies, left Kuala Slim at 7.20 a.m., and after five hours' walking over a very fair path with no steep gradients (the first three miles having been made), we reached Kuala Geliting at 4.15 p.m. Distance 14 miles from Kuala Slim, and 134 from Kuala Bernam.\n\nWe found Mr. Hill and Mr. Woodgate at Kuala Geliting waiting to go over the trace of the trunk-road with Mr. Jones.\n\nAfter dinner, had a long conversation with Haji Mustapha, Penghulu of Ulu Bernam, Saiyid Abubakar, and Wan Lengga of Pahang. They told me they had heard that no rafts had yet been prepared at Buntu to take me down the Pahang River,\nand that I should only have to wait there; so I wrote letters to several Pahang Chiefs\u2014Toh Bakar of Buntu, Toh Kaya of Penjum, and others\u2014asking them to assist me with rafts, men and boats, and I gave these letters to Mantri Muda and Che Wanda to take over the next morning, having determined to wait a day at Kuala Geliting. The aneroid at 4.15 p.m., Thermometer 88\u00b0 F., showed a height of 296 feet above the sea.\n\nThursday, 16th April.\u2014Messrs. Jones, Hill and Woodgate went off early towards Trolah to return by Pandras and examine two alternative traces for the main-road through Perak. They returned in the afternoon, and we determined that the trace already made crossing the Slim just below Kuala Geliting would be the best to adopt and the shortest. We spent our day in sketching and unpacking our stores from their boxes, as it was necessary to put them up in more manageable bundles in view of the difficult ground we had to travel over.\n\nFriday, 17th April.\u2014About thirty of our Malay coolies deserted before daylight, and this gave us a great deal of trouble, as we had not men enough to carry our baggage. By giving the Sikhs their kits to carry, we managed to get away at 8.15 a.m., with sixty-nine Malays and thirty-six Sakeis. Butler had fever and could not move. Hill, Jones and Woodgate went back to the Ulu Bernam, and Giles, Lister and I set our faces due North for Ulu Slim. After four miles of an intensely hot and trying walk through kampongs and padi-fields, we reached Kuala Briseh, the junction of the Slim and Briseh Rivers, and here we left the Slim, still flowing North and South, while we turned sharp to the East, following the course of the Briseh. Three and a half miles of very stiff walking, first through burnt secondary growth and then up a steep ascent, brought us to a bathing place on the bank of the Briseh, 1,233 feet above the sea, thermometer 85\u00b0, where at 11.45 we halted for breakfast.\n\nAfter a stay of two hours and a short further climb, we came to a curious overhanging rock called Sapor Batu (the stone lean-to) above the right bank of the Briseh River. Here we determined to camp for the night, as our coolies said they could go no further. At a very low estimate, we made 7\u00bd miles to-day from Kuala Geliting in a North-East and easterly\ndirection. The journey was infinitely more trying than the 14 miles to Kuala Geliting. Our camp was a striking sight with its fires lighting up the various groups of Sakeis, Indians, Malays and Chinese under the huge overhanging granite rock surrounded by the impenetrable gloom of virgin forest, with the faint roar of the Brisch River rushing over its rocky bed fifty feet below.\n\nSaturday, 18th April.\u2014Left Sapor Batu at 6.40 A.M., and going still easterly, with the Brisch down in a gorge on our right, we continued the ascent till we crossed a considerable tributary of the Brisch named Jelitong Laper, height 1,646 feet above the sea. Immediately afterwards we ascended a very steep hill, then followed a ridge and with longish ascents and short descents crossed in succession the following streams:\u2014\n\n7.30 A.M. S. Sapor Ibu, 1,826 feet,\n7.40 A.M. S. Sapor Anak, 1,886 feet,\nS. Sapor Manah,\n8. A.M. S. Sapor Kayu Ara, 2,281 feet,\n\nthe thermometer reading 77\u00b0 F. Fifteen minutes' walk brought us to Sapor Buluh at 8.30 A.M., height 2,550 feet above the sea, four miles from camp and eleven and-a-half miles from Kuala Geliting. Temperature 75\u00b0 F. Here a hut had been built for us, but after a halt of 25 minutes to let the baggage come up, we pushed on again almost due East up a steep ridge, and, passing Batu Hidang at 9.10 A.M., elevation 3,000 feet above sea, we reached Batu Gajah at 9.22; height 3,100 feet; and the boundary between Perak and Pahang at 9.30 A.M. The aneroid showed that the gap was 2,854 feet above Kuala Geliting and 3,150 feet above the sea.\n\nIn a very tiny rill running West we traced the source of the Brisch, and only a few feet on the other side was the first sign of a stream which, with eight others running between a succession of buttresses jutting out from the main range, forms, a little lower down, the Sungai Sambilan\u2014the most northerly of the three streams which, united, are called the Lipis; the Lipis in its turn joining the Jelei with a more northerly source, and, together, becoming the Pahang River. Looking into Pahang as one stands on the gap, a lofty mountain of some 5,000 feet rises on the right, this is Chunggang, while to the left towers\na higher mountain named Kabut. These are on the true backbone of the Peninsula, which here runs very nearly due North and South, while on either side jut out spurs more or less at right angles to the main range\u2014eastward into Pahang and westward into Perak. These spurs extend, as a rule, for about six miles on each side of the backbone.\n\nWithout halting at the summit, we immediately began the descent into Pahang, and, just as we had ascended a long, narrow, gradually rising ridge called Gunong Telaga with the Briseh River flowing down its southern base, so we descended the longest of many easterly-running ridges, the Sungai Sambilan flowing West with a slight trend to the North along its southern base, but the descent into Pahang was decidedly steeper than that into Perak, and after 30 minutes' walk we crossed one of the nine streams that form the Sambilan, and found we had come down 660 feet.\n\nThe soil on both sides was only moderate, studded all over with the most gigantic granite boulders I have ever seen in the Peninsula.\n\nOn the Perak side, I noticed many dry watercourses full of large granite blocks. In those the water may be subterraneous, as it is on the slopes of Ginting Bidei in Selangor, but more probably the long drought accounts for the absence of water. On the whole, I have never seen a range better watered than this one, and it is only surprising that the Slim is not a larger river. At 2\u00bd miles from the boundary and a height of 2,160 feet above the sea, we breakfasted by the bank of the Sambilan, road and river bearing 7\u00b0 North of East.\n\nAt 12.37 p.m. we resumed our journey, and at 1.30 p.m. reached a spot on the river called Sangka Dua, where two branches of the river meet again after dividing and forming a large island. Height above sea, 1,740 feet. Thermometer 82\u00b0 F. At 1.35 p.m. crossed the river again, but here it is named the Kenor, and has, the natives say, already received the waters of the two branches viz., the true Lipis, which rises from the western side of Gunong Temang Batuk (in which hill the Sungai Geliting takes its rise and flows westward), and the Tebalak, rising from a mountain further South, in which the Bernam River is said to have its source. The Kenor is now a considerable stream, and crossing it (1,564 feet above\nthe sea) we immediately began the ascent of what looks like an isolated hill called B\u00e9rang. It is really, however, I should say, a long spur from the main range, over the end of which the water system passes, and which the Malay crosses as a short cut rather than follow the winding course of the river. The ascent is steep but short and of no great height; the highest point we reached being 1,734 feet above the sea, and from here the saddle is so narrow that Chung-gang can be plainly seen to the South-West and Kabat to the North-West. This saddle runs round in an E.-S.-Easterly direction, and the descent is very fatiguing. The spur seems to be only a few feet across the top, but unusually long, and you descend by seven steps, each with a long gradual rise, and then a very steep descent. The bottom of this spur we reached at 3.8 p.m., height 680 feet above the sea, and crossing and recrossing the River Buntu, which comes from the North, we camped at the Ku\u00e1la Buntu, where it falls into the K\u00e9nor, and the combined rivers are here, for the first time, named the Lipis. The spot where the Buntu joins the K\u00e9nor is called Ku\u00e1la Buntu, and this spot we reached at 3.49 p.m., eleven miles from the boundary and fifteen miles from our last camp at S\u00e1por B\u00e1tu.\n\nSunday, 19th April.\u2014At 7 a.m. we left our camp, and walking through burnt secondary growth along the banks of the Lipis in a North-easterly direction reached Perm\u00e1ting Linggi at 8 a.m. This place is 640 feet above the sea and still 344 feet above Ku\u00e1la G\u00e9liting on the P\u00e9r\u00e1k side of the range. Ku\u00e1la Buntu to Perm\u00e1ting Linggi three miles. Fourteen miles from the latter place to the boundary, and twenty-five and a half miles at least from Ku\u00e1la G\u00e9liting. Good Malay walkers can do the whole distance in a day.\n\nToh Bakar, the headman of this district, met me on the road, and took us to his house at Perm\u00e1ting Linggi, where we were received with a salute from a few muskets. About a mile before reaching Perm\u00e1ting Linggi, I noticed the stream went over a bed rock of slate, and all the gold is found further down the river. Toh Bakar had prepared twenty-three small rafts for us, on which we shall have to travel to J\u00e9ram B\u00e9su\u2014a rapid where, they tell us, it is necessary to leave the river and walk to P\u00fachong. I found that Toh Bakar had never been in his\nlife to see the Raja at the mouth of the river, and though he (Toh Bakar) is called the owner of Trusang, one of the richest gold districts in Pahang, it is said the Raja has lately given the place to the Toh Gajah. Spent the day in writing and settling with our Malay and Sakei coolies, the latter returning highly delighted with their earnings. After dinner had a talk with Toh Bakar. He and the people with him told me of all the taxes they are called upon to pay. Once a year the people are numbered, and have to pay $1.33 a head to the Yam Tuan; this they call Hasil banchi. Then there is the serah, a form of squeeze still practised in Pahang; some worthless thing is sent from the Raja to a subject, a price is named, and the subject is obliged to purchase at that price. Again when a District Chief goes annually to pay homage to the Raja, the Chief calls upon every man in his district to pay $1 towards his expenses, and a similar contribution is demanded for the return journey. All gold must be sold to the Raja only, and it is said there is no standard of weight. It is said that most imports and exports are taxed, debt-slavery prevails in parts, and the people are liable to be called out for forced labour. The Dato' tells me that Mr. W. Cameron came here and went on to Batu Gajah, but he is the only white man he ever saw.\n\nA curious thing yesterday was to hear the cry, twice repeated, of a wild Sakei as yet unfamiliar with Malays. The cry was exactly like that of a wild beast, and was probably a warning to the friends of the man who uttered it; he could not have been far from us on the eastern slope of Berang. Some of our people caught with nets this afternoon two of the finest fresh water fish I ever tasted in the East\u2014ikan klah\u2014weighing about 6 lbs. each.\n\nMonday, 20th April.\u2014After no little trouble arranging our baggage for the rafts (bamboo, four feet wide and about twenty-five feet long) we left Permataang Linggi at 8 A.M. We had twenty-four rafts manned by Toh Bakar's adherents and eight of the men I had brought over. The Dato', his son and all his people accompanied us, and the start was a most picturesque scene. Each raft had a poler at the stem and another at the stern, some baggage and one or two passengers on a raised central platform. The rafts at once began the descent of a\nsuccession of rapids with intervening stretches of smooth and broken water, the stream running through a gorge with steep hills always on the northern side and sometimes on both, magnificently wooded down to the water's edge, the remarkable Gapis tree being a special feature. The bed of the stream appeared to be sometimes of slate and sometimes of sandstone, the banks usually of the latter and a good soil. No river scenery in the Peninsula have I ever seen to compare with this in beauty, added to which the novelty of shooting a long succession of fairly steep rapids made the journey most enjoyable.\n\nAt 9.15 A.M. we had to unload the rafts in order to shoot a considerable rapid called Jeram Mengalor. This was negotiated without accident, and passing a very curious fishing weir in the form of the letter W, constructed by Sakeis, we stopped for breakfast at 10.30 A.M., having descended sixty feet in a distance of about three and a half miles. We left again at 2 P.M., passed the mouths of several small tributaries, and reaching a long straggling kampong called Ulu Sungei at 2.45 P.M., we tied up for the night at its lowest end named Seribu, time 3.15 P.M., total distance, say, ten and a half miles. Unfortunately the man carrying the aneroid fell overboard from my raft and the instrument was damaged. We had to unload every raft and lift them one after another over an immense fallen tree, many similar obstructions being passed by lying down as the raft glided under one end. Altogether, without stoppages, we were five hours travelling and ten and a half miles is perhaps a low estimate of the distance, but it was carefully calculated, the compass directions being at the same time noted and shewing that the river winds considerably, the general direction being from N.E. to S.E.\n\nAt Seribu I found the Panglima Muda awaiting me, and a hut prepared for our reception by the influence of Toh Bakar. The people are all very polite and friendly, but their minds are unsettled, owing to the late attempt of the Raja Muda Mansur to enter the country, and they don't know whether my sympathies are with him or with the Yam Tuan. We made a number of sketches during the day.\n\nTuesday, 21st April.\u2014At midnight last night we had a thunderstorm followed by a heavy storm of rain, the first for\nthree months here. We seem to have brought it over with us, for the night before we could see it raining at Batu Gajah though it did not reach us. We have reason to be specially thankful for the fine weather we have had. Our journey across the hills would have been a very different matter in wet weather, many of the streams are unfordable in the rains, and though we might have made a very much more rapid descent from Batu Gajah, it would probably not have been on our feet. Two of the twelve Bernam men we were obliged to bring to help to man the rafts showed signs of cholera yesterday; one is better, but the other worse this morning, and neither is fit for work. Left Saribu at 7.15 A.M., and passed a rock called Batu Rimau. This is supposed to be a petrified tiger, his body only, his head is said to be in Jelei. At 8.20 A.M. we reached Kuala Sungai Che Nek; gold is found in the Ulu of this river. At 9 A.M. we shot the Jeram Menangis (\"the rapid of tears\"), and shortly after the Jeram Maalam, a considerable drop in the river. At 9.25 A.M. reached Batu Talam, and there met Haji Besar, my messenger, in a small boat with a letter from the Yam Tuan, saying, he feared I should find the journey over the hills a difficult one, but that he had sent orders to all the headmen to assist me. At 9.45 A.M. stopped for breakfast, and leaving again at noon reached Kuala Trusang at 2 P.M.\n\nSending on the other rafts, we landed here and walked to a spot a mile distant where some twenty Chinese are mining for gold. About a quarter of an acre has been worked out by previous miners, who are said to have got $5\u00bd katis from a hole 60 feet in diameter, but left owing to a poll tax of $8 a head being imposed, and the present men have only just begun stripping; one of them washed a basin of already once washed earth and obtained from it a few grains of gold. The spot is thirty feet above Kuala Trusang and is reached by crossing higher ground.\n\nReturned to Kuala Trusang and started again at 3.40 P.M. getting ourselves and most of our effects drenched by a very heavy storm of rain. Arrived at Kuala Semantan at 4.30 P.M., and there tied up for the night.\n\nI have ascertained that the following are the prices of certain commodities sold at Penjum, where the Ulu people have their nearest market. These prices are due to the fact that\nthe import of nearly every necessary and luxury seems to be\nfarmed to certain Chinese at Pekan, the Yam Thian\u2019s residence\nat the mouth of the river. Holding a monopoly, the farmers\nof course charge any price they like, and it is perhaps in con-\nsequence of this that the Chinese miners in Pahang are said\nto number about one hundred only, and all the Malays seem to\nbe wretchedly poor.\n\n1 tin Kerosene oil, $2.00.\nTobacco, $1 a kati.\n40 bits of Gambier, 8 cents.\n6 gantangs Salt, $1.\n1 ball of Opium $22; and so on.\n\nThe highest price for rice is said to be $1 for twelve gan-\ntangs. The currency of the country is gold, and the following\nare the weights and values:\n\n1 Itam Tengko = 4 cents of a dollar.\n1 Ken\u00e9ri of gold = 2 Itam Tengko = 8 cents.\n1 Buso = 2 Ken\u00e9ri = 2 Sagu = 16 cents.\n1 Suku = 1 Kupang = 2 Buso = 33\u00bd cents.\n3 Kupang = $1.\n4 Kupang = 4 Suku = 1 Mas = $1.33\u00bd cents.\n16 Mas = 1 Bingkal valued in Pahang at $24, which seems\ncurious as it ought only to be worth $21.28.\n\nAbout 7 p.m. I heard that a messenger had arrived from Per-\nmatang Linggi to say that one of my Bernam coolies, left\nbehind to return, had died of cholera. I determined to send\nall my Bernam men back at once, as this makes the third man\nwho has sickened in two days. One of those with us is better,\nthe other worse and unable to be moved. Kept on raining till\nlate in the night. Distance travelled to-day thirteen miles,\ngeneral direction E.S.E.\n\nWednesday, 22nd April.\u2014Sent back Penghulu Mat Saleh\nand the Bernam men except the one too sick to move; left him\nwith some money in the care of a man across the river. He\nis a very bad patient, refuses all medicine, and does everything\nhe is told not to do. He looks bad, but is, I think, perhaps\nmore frightened than really ill. We had a good deal of trou-\nble in getting new men to supply the places of these Bernam\npeople, and did not get away from Ku\u00e2la Semantan till 9 a.m. At 10.30 a.m. Imam Prang Penghulu, a great Captain and headman of some influence, met me and invited me to go and spend the night at his house. I found he lived at a place called Smau, two hours' walk inland from Kuala Dum, on the right bank of the river, and, as I should have lost a whole day by complying with his invitation and should have had to carry all our baggage inland and back again, I begged him to excuse me. He said he asked me to go to shew his friendship and good feeling, and I am afraid he was rather disappointed, but there was nothing to see at his place, and I could hardly spare the time.\n\nAt 11.30 a.m. stopped at Kuala Dum for breakfast, after which I had a long talk with the Imam Prang and his people. They all complained of excessive taxation and the want of settled laws and customs. The Imam Prang told me that every buffalo exported is liable to a tax of $3, and this goes to the Toh Gajah, though formerly he himself received it. At Penjum, there is a gambling farm, which pays the Toh Kaya $50 a month, and that chief also gets a tax of one-tenth on all imported cloth. A great deal of rice is imported from Kelantan, also silk sarongs. A good many sarongs are, however, manufactured in Pahang, chiefly at the Pekan.\n\nAt 2.30 p.m. saying good-bye to the Imam Prang, we started again and still meeting occasional rapids, we soon passed into a magnificent open country, where the scenery, though different from that in the Ulu, is in its way equally fine. The river widens into a broad stream, with a partly dry channel, shewing what a considerable river it must be in the rains. The bed is full of snags, and nothing whatever seems to have been done to it, but were it cleared, there is water enough for a launch, though of course nothing of the kind could get here owing to the Jeram Besu rapid, which cannot be passed by boat even going down-stream. There seems to be an immense tract of level ground here. I have seen nothing like it elsewhere at such a distance from the coast. I have been told that cocoa-nuts will not flourish at over fifty miles from the sea-shore, but that is a mistake, for we have seen them everywhere.\n\nAt 3.30 p.m. we passed Kuala Chenuer and Toh Bakar\ntold me that, though his territory extended further down, his people ended here. I am told that the Jelei River, which is longer and larger than the Lipis, rises in the main range with a branch from Gunong Tahan\u2014a mountain lying between the Jelei and the Temelin. The Temelin, which is said to be as considerable a stream as the Jelei, rises from the South-east face of Gunong Tahan, with a branch rising in the borders of Pahang and Tr\u00e9ngg\u00e1nu. Gunong Tahan thus stands at the meeting of Pahang, K\u00e9lant\u00e1n and Tr\u00e9ngg\u00e1nu, and is not in the main range, but as this is only native report, much reliance must not be placed on it. The Lipis, Jelei and Temelin unite and form the Pahang river. At 4 p.m. we reached Ku\u00e2la S\u00ebger, Dato' Kl\u00ee's kampong, one of the most beautiful places we have yet seen on the river. It is 363 feet above the sea. The Dato' received us most cordially, and seemed a very good-tempered, intelligent old man. Distance travelled eleven miles. General direction N.E. Distance from Ku\u00e2la Bernam, 195 miles.\n\nIn the evening the Dato' told me he could not get men enough to carry our baggage past the Jeram B\u00ebsu rapid, and that I must stay here to-morrow whilst he collects them. Toh Bakar told me he would now return with his men. I am sorry to hear that one of them has stayed behind with choleraic symptoms. I sent him some medicine.\n\nThursday, 23rd April.\u2014Che Wan Da arrived in the course of the morning with a number of men, and there was a great argument as to the liabilities of the owners of buffaloes, a man having been recently killed by one of those dangerous animals. Toh Bakar came to tell me he and his people must now return, and Toh Kl\u00ee would take me down to Penjum. He also said he had just heard that a girl he had brought down with him and left at Batu Talam died last night of cholera. It is very distressing. She was perfectly well until yesterday evening, but was then attacked and died in the night. I cannot understand it. Coming across from Slim, not a man complained, the water we have had to drink has been excellent, and they have had no cholera in Pahang up to this time. I gave Toh Bakar some medicines with directions how to use them, also a present of money to himself and his men, and we parted with mutual expressions of good-will. I have had to\nprescribe for several people since I came here, fortunately with good results.\n\nDevoted the day to writing up journal, and in the evening went out to try and find some jungle fowl, but failed. Between the river and the hills there is one great level plain covered with very short grass. Until three years ago this was a padi-field, but owing to defects in the irrigation system, they cannot now cultivate. The drought here is excessive, even the sireh vines are all burnt up; there are no vegetables, owing to the dryness of the ground, and the people live on rice and on what fish they can catch in the river. The villagers, principally the womenkind, wash the sand in the bed of the river for gold, and get from sixteen cents to one dollar's worth a day.\n\nFriday, 24th April.\u2014Left Seger at 7.30 A.M. and walked through the fields to Jeram Temale, about two miles, Giles going in the boats. All the trees that do flower seem to have come out in this dry weather, and we passed many covered all over with a splendid purple bloom, others bright scarlet and yellow, and the Memplas,* the leaves of which are used as sand-paper, in full flower, a delicate pale yellow blossom with the sweetest scent. I have never seen it in flower before, nor the trees in such profusion. These level grass plains dotted over with flowering shrubs are very unlike other parts of the Peninsula. The heat is excessive even from early morning, and the nights are not cool.\n\nHaving taken out of the rafts such baggage as would be damaged by water, we started again at 9.30 A.M., and reached Jeram Besul at 10 A.M. This rapid and the approach to it form the most striking picture we have yet seen on this river, which presents a long succession of lovely ever-changing scenes. The river widens into a pool of dark unbroken water, with steep hills covered by virgin forest rising straight from the edge of the pool; then it narrows to the head of the rapid, which is in truth a cataract. From top to bottom of the rapid,\n\n* Probably a Michelia. The ordinary mempelas is a ficus; (ficus microcarpa, ampelus and politiora). See the description of this and other species of ficus in Java. Forbes' Eastern Archipelago, 77.\u2014Ed.\nand for many miles below, the bed rock (a hard sandstone) crops out and has been cut by the water into fantastic shapes, while huge boulders are piled in picturesque confusion on either side of the channel. These rocks as we came up were covered by men in many-coloured dresses, the rafts were either lying against the rocks at the head of the cataract, or slowly filing into the basin at its head and the clouds of spray dashed up from the rapid against the deep shadow of jungle foliage made a picture not to be forgotten.\n\nThe rapid itself, comparatively small after four months' drought, is the channel of the river running under the left bank, and at first sight it did not look like a place down which either raft or boat could go in safety, but we were shortly to see that the operation, though attended with considerable risk, could be successfully performed. The rapid is about sixty yards long, with a drop of some twelve feet, the water rushes and boils and foams between walls of rock, and there are two corners in the length which make the principal dangers. Two Malays mounted a raft, one at the stem and the other at the stern, each holding a large bamboo paddle fixed in a tripod. The raft slowly reached the top of the rapid, and then leapt into the boiling stream, where the men were instantly up to their waists in water. The stern man was washed off the raft, and it looked as if nothing could save him in such a place, but while the bow man with two or three powerful strokes of the paddle kept the bow off the opposite rock, the stern man dexterously leaped again on the raft, and in a moment of time a few more strokes of the bow man's paddle had cleared the raft of the second danger\u2014a projecting rock on the other bank\u2014and the raft was in smooth water below. After this, a second raft was taken down in the same way, and then each man went alone on a raft, and, though one of them was again thrown off in the middle of the rapid, and the other one had the paddle whirled out of his hand as the raft took its first leap, no accident occurred. A number of rafts were then sent down by themselves, and they seemed to accomplish the journey almost better without assistance, but this was explained by the fact that the weight of even one man sinks the raft to a dangerous depth, where the points of unseen rocks may wreck it. Old Dato' KLI absolutely refused to allow us to tempt Providence\nin a journey down this rapid, where a good many fatal accidents have occurred, and even tried his best to make us walk to Puchong, but this we refused to do, and sending all our non-waterproof baggage, watches, &c. by land with the Sikhs, we started again on the rafts.\n\nThe river from Jeram Besu to Puchong runs through a long winding gorge, and the channel of the stream passing continuously between walls of bed rock and piles of immense detached boulders, is nothing but a series of more or less formidable rapids which succeed each other with somewhat confusing speed, but it is an exciting amusement, which we would not willingly have missed. We reached Puchong at 12.45 p.m., very hungry indeed, and the coolies carrying our baggage arriving at the same time, we sat down on the high bank of the river as we could get no shade and made a rather uncomfortable meal. People were washing for gold in the bed of the river in several places below the last rapid. From Puchong nearly all the Segger people returned, and we started again at 2.20 p.m. with our own people doing most of the poling. Ton Kli however still accompanied us.\n\nAt 2.45 p.m. we met the Orang Kaya Litris with a number of very small boats, a lot of men, and a Malay band, and when Giles, Lister and I had changed from our rafts into boats, we went on again at 3.35 p.m., and reached Penjum at 6.30 p.m., dark except for the light of the moon now about fifteen days old. I went down with the Orang Kaya in his boat and as it leaked got wet through.\n\nA great reception awaited us at Penjum; the high bank which rises from the river in three terraces was crowded by people some fifty of whom carried torches, their light strongly reflected by the river, here crowded with boats and rafts, made the effect very striking. As we hurried up the rough steps cut in the soil, a salute of many guns was fired, and the Orang Kaya, leading me by the hand, ushered us into a house which had been prepared for us, and made us as comfortable as possible with the means at his command. The \"band\" had played with great perseverance all down the river.\n\nThe distance travelled today was about sixteen and a half miles, and the general direction N.N.E. We did not get dinner\ntill 9.30 p.m., and after that the Orang Kaya and Che Ali, who had been sent by the Yam Tuan and received me with the utmost cordiality, came in for a talk. I told the Orang Kaya I wished to go on as soon as possible, but he said there was a difficulty about boats and we could not get on to-morrow; after he had left, I received a message from Che Ali to say that the Orang Kaya had not complied with the orders he received from the Sultan, and that the boats ought to have been ready.\n\nSaturday, 25th April.\u2014Che Wan Da, who brought over my letter to the Orang Kaya and has been very useful, came to tell me he would now return to his place. He told me there was a large gold mine called Jali, worked by Chinese, an hour's walk from here. I thought of going to see it, but found the journey would be useless as they were only stripping. I understand they are working the side of a hill. It is an old mine and has yielded good results in past times. I heard from the Chinese that there is plenty of gold in the country, but no one can live here owing to the injustice, \"squeezing,\" and want of government. They say whenever any one gets gold it is taken from him on some pretext or other, and that very few Chinese are now left in the place. If a man gets on a good mine, some chief claims it, work is stopped and not resumed, and the result is that the country is in a very bad state at the present time. A friend of Raja Ismail's told me that only about twenty Chinese had worked for him at Raub, and then in a very erratic and perfunctory way, sometimes stopping work altogether for months, even for a year, from want of capital.\n\nSpent the day in writing and making a sketch of Penjum from across the river. This place is 210 feet above sea level.\n\nSunday, 26th April.\u2014I had begged that the boats might be ready for us at 6 a.m., but was disappointed. In spite of the Yam Tuan's letter, there were only two large boats and a small one ready for our party of twenty-five, Wan Ali giving me the best part of his boat. We put the servants into the small boat, Giles and Lister went in the large one, and a number of Sikhs in the other large boat, but finding it leaked, we had to move them into a boat which providentially arrived at that moment sent by the Imam Prang Gajah, with his son as ambassador, to meet us. Wan Ali was exceedingly angry\nand said unkind things of the Orang Kaya Lipis, who kept walking on the bank in an aimless way seemingly quite unable to meet such a demand on his energy and resources. I of course said nothing, but Wan Ali told me the Yam Tuan had sent orders to all the Chiefs to assist me and treat me as they would himself. I had paid Toh Biker for the very great help he had given us (without any orders from his Sultan) and I also sent away Toh Kli happy with a present, for he is not well off, nor in the way of squeezing other people to do his work, but I only thanked the Orang Kaya for what he did and in any case I should have hesitated to offer him money.\n\nI was sorry not to meet here the Orang Kaya Jelei, to whom the Sultan had sent a letter telling him to meet us at Penjum, but the Orang Kaya lives so far off he had not time to comply with the order, and I left a message for him in case he came after we had gone. The delay in getting our party finally settled into boats was so great that we did not leave Penjum till 10 A.M.\n\nAbove Kuala Priok, Che Wan Da met us with a present of rice, and we stopped at the Kuala, a beautiful place, for breakfast. Che Wan Da's father lives here. On the way down the river, we passed a gigantic waterwheel fixed in the river and used for irrigating the land on the bank. The wheel (undershot) is forced slowly round by the current of the river. On its outer circumference are fixed at a certain angle lengths of bamboo closed at one end and open at the other and as the wheel revolves these bamboos in turn enter the river, mouth upwards, are filled with water, and, as they arrive at the highest point of their orbit, they, one after the other, discharge their load of water into a trough which conveys it by gravitation to the required point in the field. I have not before seen in the Malay States so large or well-constructed an irrigating wheel, but I believe they have been and still may be used in Ulu Muar.\n\nLeft Kuala Priok at 1.30 p.m. and continuing our journey reached Kuala Lipis (where this river falls into the Jelei) at 1.50 p.m. Here Che Wan Da left us to return to his home; he has been very useful and shewn a great desire to be friendly and helpful. The combined rivers\u2014the Lipis and Jelei\u2014immediately after their junction, are about sixty yards wide. The\nJelei carries rather more water than the Lipis. Camped for the night at Pulau Krinai at 5.30 p.m., having passed the following kampongs during the day:\u2014Bandar Lama, Kampung Pulau, Sematong, Jeram Lama, Kuala Kechau.\n\nDistance travelled to-day, ten miles; general direction N.N.E.\n\nMonday, 27th April.\u2014Started before 6 a.m. and passing Changkong, where there is a longish rapid with but little fall in it but many rocks which make it difficult for boats to navigate, stopped just below at noon for breakfast. The river is here about 100 yards wide, that is, the bed of the stream from bank to bank. There were numerous tracks of deer on the sandspit where we lunched, and while we stayed there the carcase of a wild pig floated past. Leaving again at 1.30 p.m. we camped for the night at Kuala Temelin, where the waters of that stream join the combined Lipis and Jelei thus forming the Pahang River.*\n\nThe Temelin, which, as I have said, comes from the North and rises in a mountain on the borders of Pahang and Trengganu, is in width and body of water about the same size as the combined Lipis and Jelei, at least so it appears at the confluence, but it is a curious fact that neither the addition of the waters of the Jelei nor yet of the Temelin appears to make any immediate and pronounced difference in the width or depth of the Pahang River. The growth of the stream seems gradual, and, except at the actual points of junction, the reception of the waters of the Jelei and Temelin, themselves large rivers, seems to have no more effect in widening or deepening the river than is made by the addition of the waters of any of those smaller tributaries the mouths of which we pass daily. It was 5 p.m. when we reached Kuala Temelin, 154 feet above the sea, and with some difficulty I got here a few specimens of really excellent Malay pottery\u2014vessels of various forms and designs for holding water.\n\n* This place is mentioned in Perak history, on the occasion of the marriage of the Raja Muda of Pahang with a Perak princess (circa A.D. 1600), as the place at which the Perak and Pahang envoys met. The Temelin is the river called Tembelang in the Misa Malayu and in the Undang-undang ka Raja-an (code of laws) of Perak, Pahang and Johor. See No. 9 of this Journal, p. 101.\nKu\u00e2la Temelin is celebrated in Pahang for its earthenware, but like all natives far from a market, the potters keep no stock and make only what is ordered. The shapes of the jars I got are all good, and the decoration, done with a sharp tool before the firing, is most artistic. We ordered some further specimens to be made, including incense-burners.\n\nDistance travelled to-day 21\u00bd miles; general direction E.S.E.\n\nWe passed, in the order in which they are given, the following small villages or clusters of huts on our journey to-day:\u2014P\u00e2sir Sibau, Jeram Ch\u00e9kuas, B\u00e2tu G\u00e2jah, Sungei K\u00eanung, Rantau Panjang, Pulau Sa'amas, Sungei Chika, Pulau Tam-b\u00e2nga, Changkat Glugor, B\u00e2tu P\u00e2pao.\n\nTuesday, 28th April.\u2014Got away at 5.30 a.m., and stopped for breakfast at Kangsa at 12.25 p.m. The temperature in my boat at noon was 93\u00b0 and in the water of the river 98\u00b0. The thermometer stands at 95\u00b0 in the boat every day at 2 p.m. and the excessive heat of Pahang strikes us all. We notice here that the people are decidedly darker than the Malays on the western side of the Peninsula, and those Malays who have come with us from Perak complain especially of the great heat of the ground to bare feet when walking in the exposed fields which stretch inland from the river bank. Unfortunately I broke the thermometer to-day, but I do not think it could tell us much more than we have learnt already.\n\nStarted again at 3.45 p.m., and reached Pulau T\u00e2wer at 4 p.m. Here we were met by the Imam Prang Indra G\u00e2jah, the Yam T\u00fban's right-hand man in all matters connected with that part of the country which lies up-stream from Pulau T\u00e2wer. The Imam Prang gave us a most cordial reception and, dragging me by the hand up the almost vertical bank (here twenty to twenty-five feet high), ushered us into a comfortable hut, which we were informed had been constructed in a day. Our subsequent proceedings, whether dressing, writing, eating or sleeping, seemed to be matters of the deepest interest to the large crowd of Malays who surrounded the place and never lost sight of us for a moment. Ton G\u00e2jah, who is a man of about forty, very thickset and dark, but full of laughter, informed me that he had four wives, twenty-five children and nine grandchildren. He introduced his brother and a few of his male children, and after seeing that we wanted nothing\nwent to arrange for men to take us to Kota Kelanggi to-morrow morning as I expressed a wish to visit the caves there.\n\nNo one has been for some time, and the path is said to be overgrown, so the Ton Gajah sent off a lot of men to clear it. The river here is about 700 feet wide (about the same width as the Perak River at Kuala Kangsa); the banks are exceedingly high and steep and the river at the present time is said to be lower than ever known. The Ton Gajah says that if the drought continues for another two months, that is, making six instead of three dry months as usual, there may be partial famine in the place.\n\nThe Ton Gajah settled with his people at Pulau Tawer twelve years ago, after he returned from Klang where he was sent in command of the three thousand Pahang men who, at the request of Governor Sir Harry Ord, were despatched by the Bendahara to assist Tunku Dia Uddin in the struggle with Raja Mahdi.\n\nA fine kampong, and houses shut in by a long bamboo fence, stretches along the bank of the river in a grove of young cocoa-nut and other fruit trees. Behind this hamlet extends an almost level plain, as far as the eye can reach, broken only to the North by a small pointed hill, and to the East by the limestone rocks in which are the caves of Kota Kelanggi. A considerable portion of the plain is now being ploughed for the cultivation of rice, and the rest is jungle.\n\nFar away to the West is the mass of hills called Gunong Raya, to the North of which lies the river down which we have come. The mountains of the main range are nowhere visible, and we are told that the mouth of the Pahang River lies from here East a little South.\n\nTon Gajah's father was a Sumatran Malay, his mother a Pahang woman; he is reported to be a great warrior, is the Field Marshal of Pahang and ranks with the Orang Besar Ampat or Chiefs of the first class. He is a man of much energy, greatly feared by the discontented faction in the upper country and greatly trusted by the Yam Tuan.\n\nI have ascertained from Cie Ali, who is a good authority and one of the Yam Tuan's most trusted adherents, that the following are the principal Chiefs of Pahang:\u2014\nJOURNEY ACROSS THE MALAY PENINSULA.\n\nNew Creation,\n\u00d4rang B\u00e9sar Ampat, Class I.\n\nThe R\u00e1ja Muda.\nThe D\u00e1toh B\u00e9ndah\u00e1ra.\nThe D\u00e1toh T\u00e9m\u00ebnggong.\n1. The Toh Bandar.\n2. Toh K\u00e1ya Ch\u00e9no.\n3. Toh K\u00e1ya T\u00e9merloh (at present vacant).\n4. Mahar\u00e1ja Perba (at present the \u00d4rang K\u00e1ya J\u00e9lei holds this post).\n5. Toh Muda Tunggal.\n6. Toh Jabe.\n7. Toh Bangau.\n8. Toh \u00d3mar (held by the \u00d4orang K\u00e1ya S\u00e9mant\u00e1n, who is also Orang K\u00e1ya Pahlawan).\n9. Toh P\u00e9ngg\u00e1wa.\n10. Toh L\u00e9la.\n11. Orang K\u00e1ya J\u00e9lei.\n12. Orang K\u00e1ya Lipis.\n\nDistance travelled to-day, eighteen and a half miles; general direction, S.E. We passed the following villages on the way:\u2014Kampung Te, Tanjong G\u00e1tal, Tanjong Lindong, Pulau Did\u00e1ri, Ku\u00e1la P\u00e9da, Kampung Ku\u00e1la S\u00e9lan, Ku\u00e1la K\u00e9dundong.\n\nWednesday, 29th April.\u2014I think the Toh G\u00e1jah must have been up all night, for he appeared at midnight and again at 4.30 A.M. We got up at 5.30 A.M., but could not make a start till 7 A.M. Then, with the Toh G\u00e1jah and nearly 100 men, all armed as every one seems to be in this State, we started down the left bank of the river for Ku\u00e1la T\u00e9kam, a distance of one and a half miles, level walking but hot, for in Pahang, in this weather at any rate, light means heat and from daylight to dark one seems to be in a vapour bath. It was a curious sight to see in the Malay Peninsula buffaloes ploughing the slightly undulating plain of dry but not hard soil and more strange still to be told that the rice grain is then sown as wheat is in the West, the ground harrowed and no irrigation done whatever, the harvest depending simply upon the rain. These fields when fallow seem to grow no weeds, only a sparse short grass, and they are ploughed across and across like a chess-board several times before the wooden\nplough gets deep enough, then sown, harrowed, and nothing more is required till the time of harvest.\n\nThese fields have for many years yielded crop after crop under these conditions, and the only renewal or manuring of the soil is the annual small flood, which rises over even these high banks, and a higher flood which comes about once in six years and drives the people out of their homes into rafts. I should suppose that with this soil and three months rainless weather, cotton might be successfully grown.\n\nThe Sungei T\u00e9kam was almost dry, and whilst the Malays walked up the bed crossing and recrossing what little water there was, we were dragged up-stream in a dug-out for half a mile and then landing walked over a good level jungle-path for two and a half miles reaching K\u00f4ta Tongkat 8.35 A.M. This K\u00f4ta Tongkat is a curious sort of gate through which a river appears to have run, and it is flanked on both sides by high limestone cliffs covered with foliage; these cliffs appear to shut in a narrow valley, a mile long, at the far end of which is the cave K\u00f4ta Kelanggi,* in reality, however, the valley is only rock-bound on the right hand side as you enter and the ancient river must have met this obstruction at K\u00f4ta Kelanggi, been turned by it and, cutting along the face of these limestone cliffs, made its exit through the Kota Tongkat and thence found its way, probably by the channel of the Sungei T\u00e9kam, to the Pahang River. There is nothing specially remarkable about K\u00f4ta Tongkat, but since the river ceased to flow through this giant gate of stone, the action of the atmosphere has formed a number of stalactites which extend from the clear cut ledges of roof to the ground (no great distance) and these probably gave to the place its present name\u2014Kota Tongkat.\n\nAfter a short rest here (the Tou Gajah having succumbed to the pace at which we came from the river), we walked up the valley until we reached the foot of K\u00f4ta Balei. Up to this cave we climbed by a ladder of forty steps and then found ourselves in a vast cave lighted mainly from the entrance and completely closed at the further end, but having three subsi-\n\n* See Mr. Cameron's account of his visit to these caves, No. 9 of this Journal, p. 153. Ed.\ndiary caves or chambers, two on the right of the entrance and one on the left, each partially lighted by rifts in the roof. The main cave and the smaller chambers are all very fine, and reminded me of the Selangor cave at Batu, though I do not think any of them equal in beauty or size that magnificent rock chamber.\n\nWe spent a considerable time in this Kota Balei and then, descending the ladder, walked a few steps to the edge of the present insignificant stream where you find yourself facing a long, low and straight gallery with a straight, flat roof not less than twenty feet wide. This very remarkable passage with its wide flat roof only about seven to eight feet from the ground was cut by the river out of the solid rock before that ancient period when, for some reason not yet explained, the volume of water in the river became immensely reduced, or the original stream was diverted into some other channel leaving the results of the battle between the water and the rock in the form of the present caves, whence all trace of water has disappeared leaving only the evidence of its power as a constant source of admiration and wonder to the Malays of the country.\n\nAt the end of this gallery the rock has been hollowed out into a circular chamber of some height, while from the centre of the ceiling depends one enormous and strikingly beautiful stalactite. After luncheon, with lanterns and torches we explored the long dark cavern which extends into the hill from the back of this circular ante-chamber.\n\nThere is nothing to reward the explorer, but the place is infested by myriads of bats which are only with difficulty kept from striking you in their blind flight towards the lights. The masses of Malays in their many coloured dresses with the light of the torches shining on their weapons and swarthy faces, the deep shadowy gloom of the cave as a background, here and there faintly lighted by a ray from the distant entrance, made a scene very remarkable in its picturesque effect.\n\nWe left Kota Kelanggi at noon and reached our hut at Pulau Tawer in exactly two hours, after a very smart walk; the heat from Kuala Tekam to the village was indescribable, and the Ton Gajan was quite knocked up, taking refuge in a\nboat and shirking the last mile and a half. About 4 p.m. a heavy storm of rain fell and continued till late in the night. From 8 p.m. till 11 p.m. I talked politics with the Toh Gajah and Che Ali and then retired to the boat to sleep so that we might be able to start in the morning without delay.\n\nIt is worthy of record that this Kota Kelanggi is mentioned in the Sejara Malaun (the Malay Annals) as having been occupied by the Siamese. The Sejara Malaun is supposed to be the earliest written record of Malay History.\n\nThursday, 30th April.\u2014Did not get away till 7 a.m., Toh Gajah accompanying us. At 10 a.m. passed Batu Burong, where the cave-making process may be very readily seen in the action of the Pahang River on a huge limestone rock which crops out from its left bank. It is said that there is a subterranean channel from the bottom of this cliff to a place many days' journey down the river. At 10.30 a.m. reached Pulau Buran, where there are said to be quantities of selidang (wild cattle) in the wet season. In the line of the next reach of the river and straight ahead of us lie two remarkable isolated hills called Bukit Senyum and Bukit Sah. These hills are said to be plainly visible from the sea and used by the fishermen as landmarks.\n\nAt noon reached Tanjong Blanja, the limits of Toh Gajah's jurisdiction, and here we stayed for one and a half hours breakfasting and then parted with the Datoh and continued our journey down river. The Toh Gajah has done everything possible for us. I gave him my Perak golok (chopping knife) and we parted excellent friends. I saw him in the river up to his waist saying good-bye to the Subadar.\n\nPassing Kuala Krau, a river and kampung on the right bank, we reached Pulau Chengal at 6.20 p.m., and there camped for the night. Distance travelled, 17\u00bd miles; general direction, South.\n\nThe following kampongs were passed during the day:\u2014Klang, Sungei Kio, Tanjong Antan, Tanjong Tenggoh, Teluk Maik, Sungei Selul, Pulau Raya.\n\nFriday, 1st May.\u2014Left at 6 a.m. and passed a Chinese sugar mill at Pengkalen Benom at 8.30 a.m.; subsequently we saw several of these mills on the left bank, they are driven by buffaloes, and the juice is expressed from the canes by pass-\ning them between three revolving circular blocks of wood in juxtaposition on the same horizontal plane. At 9.30 A.M. Bukit S\u00e9nyum appeared directly astern of the boats, which were then dropping down a long straight reach of the river. Passing Pasir Mandi, one hundred feet above the sea, we stopped at Teluk Sintang at noon for breakfast. The river here cuts deeply into the right bank forming a bay and making the width of the stream at this point very considerable.\n\nThe Bungau trees with their gorgeous purple flowers grow larger and more numerous as we descend the river, and the forest is everywhere strikingly beautiful. I saw a quantity of maiden-hair fern in the jungle to-day at our halting place, but it did not look like a new kind.\n\nLeft Teluk Sintang at 1.30 P.M., passed Kuala Semantan Ilir a little before 5 P.M., and reached Pulau Temerloh at 6 P.M. Camped here for the night. Pulau Temerloh, said to be halfway between the Sultan's place and Penjum, is an extensive kampong, admirably situated on the right bank opposite to a large island which here divides the stream.\n\nDistance travelled to-day, twenty-one miles; general direction, South. Distance from Kuala Bernam, 300 miles.\n\nPassed the following kampongs to-day:\u2014Jenerak, Kuala Tezkai, Lapat Kajang, Dor, Sanggang, Bintang, T\u00e9bing Tinggi, Balei Gantang and Bangau.\n\nSaturday, 2nd May.\u2014To-day the villages are larger, the river is wider though no deeper, and the banks are not quite so high. There must be a very considerable population of Malays settled on the banks of the Pahang, and its three large tributaries, of which the Jelei is undoubtedly the longest, and is properly called by the Malays the parent stream. We left Temerloh at 3 A.M., and passed Gual, a large village on the left bank, at 9 A.M., reaching Triang, kampong and tributary stream, at 10 A.M. Triang is 88 feet above the sea. At Triang the river was very shallow, and twice we had to drag our boat over the sand. Breakfasted at Kuala Bra at noon, and leaving again at 2.30 P.M., reached Kerbau at 7 P.M., and camped there for the night. There is a hill called Bukit Kerbau on the right bank, and the place at present is chiefly remarkable for the enormous extent of sand which stretches between the left bank and the channel of the river. Under the right bank, however, there\nis a deep hole said to be infested by crocodiles, and these reptiles have dragged four or five people, sleeping on the sand, into the pool.\n\nWe passed the following villages and kampongs today, in the order named:\u2014P\u00e1sir Anam, Ber\u00e1leh K\u00e1pas, Leb\u00e1k B\u00e9l\u00e9ngu, Jilam, M\u00e9nk\u00e1rak, Tambak, L\u00f3bok P\u00e1rap, P\u00e1mun, Ch\u00e9ni, Batu P\u00e1pan, Batu Hanchor, L\u00f3bok Lien, Pulau K\u00e9ni, Sintang, L\u00e9muse, Pulau Nyak.\n\nDistance travelled, twenty-five miles; general direction, North.\n\nSunday, 3rd May.\u2014It was intolerably hot and close last night, and having started the boats at 12.30 A.M., I tried in vain to sleep on the stern platform of my boat in spite of mosquitoes, and it was not till nearly 5 A.M. that sleep was possible.\n\nIt is hardly fair to complain of mosquitoes here, for though the statement that there are none in Pahang is no more accurate than that there are no snakes in Perak, yet there are comparatively few of these pests, in this dry weather at all events, and even after the occasional showers of rain we have had hardly any.\n\nWe stuck on a sand-bank for half an hour almost directly after starting, and passed Ch\u00e9no at 1.30 A.M. Ch\u00e9no is celebrated for making the best mats in Pahang. They are made of bleached and dyed Mengkuang leaves and are very pretty.\n\nFrom Ch\u00e9no we pushed on down some very long reaches, each two and three miles in length, and even more, usually with islands at intervals making an ever-changing panorama of beautiful pictures. Passed Lawan at 10 A.M., fifty-five feet above the sea, and at noon we stopped opposite Bukit Serlin for breakfast. Left again at 2 P.M., and passing Kuala Luit, a river formerly worked for gold, we reached Terpei at 3.30 P.M. From here there is a good view of the high mountain called Gunong Ch\u00e9ni, a long irregular triple-peaked mass of hills with a large lake, or series of lakes, at its base.\n\nGunong Ch\u00e9ni is seen on the right bank of the river apparently distant about five miles. The lakes are only approachable by a small river\u2014the Ch\u00e9ni (almost dry in this weather), the mouth of which we passed at 4 P.M. The Malays have a great dread of these lakes, will not live near them, though they\nare full of fish, and say they are haunted by evil spirits.\n\nStopped for the night on the sands at Sungei Duri at 6.30 p.m., the last of the boats not coming up till 8.30 p.m. Sungei Duri is another place with a reputation for crocodiles. Che Ali's nephew was taken here two years ago, but was rescued by his cousin, though the crocodile injured him for life. In the sixteen hours we were travelling today, we made thirty-one and three-quarter miles, going at times in nearly all the directions on the compass, but mainly South.\n\nPassed the following places:\u2014Pulau Malaang, Batu Gajah, Kuala Jingka, Pesagi, Tanjong Batu, Kuala Jempol, Pejin, Temiang, Lam\u00e9, Kuala Mentanang, Galong, Labok Paku, Batu Rakit, Kuala Temelong, Pulau Dato'.\n\nMonday, 4th May.\u2014Left Sungei Duri at 5 a.m. Stopped for two hours at Pinyo, thirty-nine feet above the sea\u2014Che Ali's kampong\u2014and made an unsuccessful search for peacock, but shot some golden plover. We have seen several peacock on the sands in the early morning, but they keep out of range of anything but a rifle. Passed Sungei Mentiga (whatever that may mean) at noon. This small stream, which flows into the Pahang River, not a day's journey from the sea, bifurcates and one branch, called Sempang, runs back towards the Rumpin river, a tributary of the Muar, so that by ascending the Muar and Rumpin rivers, crossing a few hundred yards of land and descending the Sempang, Mentiga and Pahang Rivers, or vice versa, the Peninsula can very easily be crossed in a comparatively short time.\n\nStopped at Batu Buai for breakfast at 11.30 a.m., and continuing our journey at 2 p.m. reached Tanjong Pulei at 6.30 p.m. The river is here about one thousand yards wide.\n\nDistance travelled, eighteen miles; general direction, E.N.E.\n\nPassed the following kampongs today:\u2014Kinchi, Pulau Ubah, Pulau Plak, Kuala Lepra, Pulau Kepayang.\n\nTuesday, 5th May.\u2014Started at 2 a.m., and stopped at Ganchong at 8 a.m. for an hour to allow the boatmen to breakfast. Ganchong is only twelve feet above sea level. Che Ali went on from here in a small boat to tell the Yam Tuan of our whereabouts. At 1 p.m. reached Langger, a fine kampong on the left bank, where the whole population turned out to watch us breakfasting. Left again at 2.30 p.m., and reached Pulau\nKledi, two miles above the Pekan, at 4.15 p.m. Here we waited, according to agreement, and in a short time Che Ali returned with Che Gadoh and a message from the Yam Tuan to say that he was very unwell (consumption they say), and asking me to wait here till to-morrow to allow them to make proper preparations. We accordingly camped on the bank, and the tide falling left us ten yards of mud to cross to the boats.\n\nDistance travelled, eighteen miles; general direction, S.E. The river is about one thousand yards wide at this point, and the banks low, but covered with grass and jungle where there is no cultivation.\n\nUnlike the rivers on the West coast, there is no mangrove. To-day the banks were thickly populated, and we passed the following hamlets:\u2014Kampung Temai, Bluker Aceh, Pulau Ganchong, Tanjong Rengas, Aur Gading, Kampung Teluk, Sungai Pahang Tua, Kala Langger.\n\nThis sort of travelling may seem very easy and pleasant, but it has its disadvantages; for instance, at midnight I started for bed, seemingly no very difficult journey, and immediately stepped into a nest of the semut api, or fire ant, that is an experience that no one would care to repeat. A Sikh then carried me over the mud and deposited me up to my ankles in water in a dug-out and, with the assistance of that unstable conveyance, I reached the back of my boat somewhere in the depths of which a rat had died three days before. To get as far as possible from the pestilent stench of the decaying rat, I had had my mosquito net hung in the middle of the boat, and to reach that it was necessary to crawl through two doors, each two and a half feet by two feet, and over the body of a sleeping Malay, arranged seemingly to make one's progress as difficult and uncomfortable as possible. Then I faced my curtain to find the hole through which alone entrance can be gained, and which for the best reasons is not in the side but in the bottom of the curtain, next the side of the boat, i.e., with two inches of wood between it and the water. Through that hole I got by a series of gymnastic feats which no one would attempt in the light, and finally reached my goal to find the small mattress quite wet with the heavy dew, and the curtain simply wringing. Fifteen days in a boat four feet wide\nand only high enough to sit up on the floor, where the thermometer registers from $92^\\circ$ to $95^\\circ$ for several hours in each day, where rats, scorpions, centipedes, and other vermin abound, and where the crew are too close to be agreeable in this climate, is an experience which forces its drawbacks on the notice of the traveller, in spite of the loveliest scenery and situations which are often more picturesque than pleasant. One result of these circumstances is that, ever since we started, not less than twenty per cent. of our party have been on the sick list, the medicine chest has proved invaluable, and, considering how often its dangerous contents have been drawn upon, it is surprising that, with so much liberality and so little skill, no particular harm has been done. The man and woman who died of cholera were never under my treatment, I am glad to say, and since leaving Seger we have heard nothing more of cholera.\n\nWednesday, 6th May.\u2014Went ashore early this morning, and shot a couple of peacock and a brace of jungle fowl. It is certainly rather an astonishing sight to see peacock flying about or sitting on the dead stumps of an old clearing. I also saw a snipe, which is rather remarkable at this time of year and after such a drought; the ground he was in was hard and dry as a highroad. The tide is curious here, it was falling when we arrived at 4 p.m. yesterday, it fell a good deal lower, and at midnight some of our boats were high and dry; at 5 a.m. they they were still in the same position, but at 8 a.m. the tide began to rise, and at 2 p.m. it was nearly up to the top of the bank.\n\nAt that hour, on the top of high water, four large barges appeared round the point which hides the Yam Tuan's place from us, and in a few minutes reached us. They were all crowded with rowers and chiefs who invited us to take our seats in the largest boat, a long two-storeyed barge with twenty-two rowers clad in yellow jackets, sarongs and white trousers. Half an hour's paddling carried us over the two miles of water, and we landed at the stairs in front of the Yam Tuan's house, an immense crowd of well dressed Malays lining the steps, the bank of the river and both sides of the road from the jetty down to the gate of the reception hall, where a double line of spearmen waited and conducted us to\nthe hall, a nicely decorated room raised on low pillars. Here the Datoh B\u00e9ndah\u00e1ra, and Datoh T\u00e9m\u00e9nggong, the two Chief Officers of the State, received us with great ceremony, and telling us the Yam T\u00faan was far from well but wished to see us, invited us to sit down. Whilst we made our way from the landing place and greeted the B\u00e9ndah\u00e1ra and T\u00e9m\u00e9nggong, a salute was being fired lower down the river.\n\nI carried on a spasmodic conversation with the B\u00e9ndah\u00e1ra for one and a half hours, during which the Yam T\u00faan again sent to say he meant to come and see us, and then His Highness appeared. He certainly looked deadly ill, but he was just as courteous and nice as ever, and we all thought he looked a trifle better and spoke with less difficulty (his voice was hoarse and changed, and he complained of cough and fever) when we left him than when he came in.\n\nAfter I had told him of our journey, he asked us to have some coffee, &c., he and his son, a nice looking boy, joining in this part of the ceremony, and then I told him I should like to see him when he felt better and we left.\n\nSome of the Yam T\u00faan's people took us across the river to a raft which had been prepared for our accommodation. On the raft is a plank house containing one large room, very comfortably furnished, and a sort of verandah all round it has been planked over so that we can sit out and watch the busy river-life with the picturesque town and palm groves for a background. Another raft much larger than ours with an upper storey (but rapidly falling into decay) was handed over to our people, and a guard of twenty-two Malays were sent to see that no harm befell us! The B\u00e9ndah\u00e1ra, T\u00e9m\u00e9nggong and others came to see that everything was in order, and then we were left to ourselves. In the night there was a tremendous storm of rain with thunder and lightning, but that was hardly so disturbing as the uproar made by the rats who live under the floor of our raft, a protest I suppose against our occupation of the tenement.\n\nThursday, 7th May.\u2014The Dato' Mautri of Johor called on me and we had a very long talk about Pahang and the other States.\n\nOn making up our itinerary, I find that we have come down the river two hundred and forty-one and a half miles from\nBuntu, and three hundred and ninety-five miles from Kuala\nBernam, while there remains another seven miles or so to the\nmouth of the river.\n\nThere is much to admire in this place. Specially striking to\nany one acquainted with the other Native States is the appear-\nance of the village on the banks of this large river, here about\nfifteen hundred yards wide, with the picturesque house rafts\nmoored not only along the bank of the river and in face of\nthe Yam Tuan's various houses, but along the shores of the\nislands which here stud the stream.\n\nThese islands are the most beautiful feature of the place;\nthey are large, covered with cultivation in the shape of palms,\nthe cocoa-nut, betel and jagaree, or with flowering trees and\nshrubs and fine short grass. The raft we occupy is moored\nto the shore of one of these islands just opposite the new\nmosque of Pekan, and between us and the opposite bank of\nthe river are three considerable islands with wide stretches of\nwater in between.\n\nOn shore in the village there are four notable buildings\u2014the\nnew mosque in the angle made by a small stream or canal\ncoming into the river from the right bank; one hundred and\nfifty yards higher up a new brick house such as those occupied\nby Europeans in Singapore; one hundred and fifty yards fur-\nther on, the old mosque, a building with far more to recommend\nit as regards appearance than the new one; and immediately\nto the right rear of the mosque the Yam Tuan's principal\nhouse, a building which, as far as I could judge, is as satisfactory\nin its accommodation as it is pleasing to the eye. This house,\nwhich was built without any plan, is said to have cost \u00a325,000,\nand is worth the money.\n\nThe Yam Tuan's Balei or Audience Hall is an indifferent\nstructure inside the enclosure of another and less pretentious\nhouse, which stands half way between the old mosque and the\nnew one.\n\nThe business part of the village is of the most wretched\ndescription. Two small rows of the veriest hovels, built on\neither side of the main road, containing in all forty or fifty\ndwellings constitute the \"bazaar\" of the principal place in\nPahang. As long as the customs of the country are such\nthat Chinese don't find it to their advantage to settle here,\nthere is no likelihood of improvement in this respect. At the present time the Chinese population of Pekan numbers about eighty, and when asked why that is so, they reply because the taxation, both in system and as including every article of import or export, is intolerable, and that if ever they import from outside, or buy in the interior anything of value, it is removed by some chief who forgets to pay for it. Chinese will put up with many evils and difficulties and much injustice that no European will tolerate, and while making every allowance for exaggeration, mistakes and wilful falsehoods, the fact that there are not more than two or three hundred Chinese in the whole of this large and rich State so close to Singapore is the best proof of how matters really stand.\n\nThis is the fourth time I have visited Pahang, and I have on this occasion had an opportunity of verifying some of the stories that have reached us in the last two years. Without proceeding to details, I can say that those whose experience of the Peninsula has been confined to the Protected Native States would be rather astonished at the manners and customs still prevalent in the governing class in Pahang and if Europeans will risk their capital in any large undertaking here and can manage to comply with their obligations, get business transacted, and obtain justice and satisfaction in their dealings with those they are brought in contact with, I think it will be a little surprising. It will also be well for them to remember that in a purely Malay State patience is not so much a virtue as a necessity.\n\nA good many wide and well selected roads have been laid out and formed, but not metalled, in and about the Pekan; some fair bridges have also been constructed, and it seems as if, in any future arrangements for the housing of a large Chinese or other population, some new ground would have to be chosen for the site of a town, as there is none available upstream of the canal to which I have referred. Below that, however, land might be got and a town built with the advantage that large boats and steam-launches can get to this point and lie there while they cannot reach the mouth of the canal owing to the shallowness of the water.\n\nAll the ground about the Yam Tuan's house being already occupied, the best spot for dwelling houses is the island which\nlies opposite the Yam Tuan's principal dwelling. The whole country seems to be one vast level plain only a few feet above the level of the river, the soil is excellent and would probably grow any low-country produce, while swamps seem unknown, though I have no doubt the appearance of the place is different in the wet season.\n\nThe people of the country, outside the Rajas and Chiefs, with some few exceptions, are industrious for Malays, but their distaste for work may, to some extent, be explained by the fact that a man does not care to work for more than bare subsistence if his gains can always be appropriated by his more powerful neighbour. That, at least, is an explanation offered here and in other Malay States, especially where Siamese influence is strong. Sic vos non robis might have been written of the Malay ryot.\n\nThe principal industries of Pahang are agriculture (the cultivation of rice and fruit), the rearing of cattle (especially buffaloes, which are very cheap here), sheep and poultry, a little gold-washing (but there are good reasons why this occupation is limited), and the manufacture of mats and silk cloth. The weaving and mat-making is done by the women, and the silk and mats produced are excellent of their kind, but very little known outside Pahang.\n\nThe present occupation of the ruling class in Pahang is topspinning, and the example is pretty generally followed by all the unemployed male Malays in Pekan. There is not much to be said against this very innocent amusement, but it strikes the casual observer as curious that while the people of the Ulu (and indeed nearly every one outside this village) are crying out for the redress of manifest grievances and the introduction of something resembling fixed laws and fair government, those who have the direction of affairs devote to the spinning of tops the time that can be spared from less harmless distractions.\n\nIn many respects the State is unlike any on the western coast and more nearly resembles Kelantan in features and products. Pahang has undoubtedly great resources and unusual capabilities for supporting and enriching a large population and no intelligent person could see the country without regretting the circumstances which still keep it closed to\nlegitimate enterprise, whilst its people are unable to take advantage of the gifts lying ready to their hands.\n\nThe Map which accompanies this journal shows the route we followed from Kuala Bernam in the Straits of Malacca, Latitude 3\u00b0 50', to Kuala Pahang in the China Sea, Latitude 3\u00b0 44'. The trace of the Bernam River has been taken from existing information, lately revised by Mr. F. St.G. Caulfield, also the land route from Kuala Slim to Kuala Gelting. From Kuala Gelting on the Bernam to Buntu on the Lipis River is roughly sketched from a time and compass survey, the distances and general direction being fairly correct, but there is no attempt at accuracy. The sketch of the Lipis and Pahang Rivers is plotted from a time and compass survey made by Captain Giles, R.A., and in this case there is no pretence to accuracy, though it will probably be some years before a more careful survey is made of this river.\n\nSo far as I know, this is the first time the Peninsula has been crossed from sea to sea by a European from any point North of the Muar River, that is to say, in the wider part where the journey can only be accomplished by crossing the main range of mountains which forms the backbone of the Peninsula. I believe that Mr. C. Bozzolo crossed from the Galena mines in Patani to the mouth of the Muda River in Kedah, passing however North of the main dividing range.\n\nFourteen years ago I saw in Klang a Frenchman who told me he had three times crossed the Peninsula from Klang to Tranggau, but there are very strong reasons for doubting that statement.\n\nSome years ago Messrs. Daly and O'Brien ascended the Muar River, crossed a few hundred yards of dry land by portage and descended the Bra, a tributary of the Pahang River, having its embouchure about eighty miles above Pekan, while Mr. W. Knaggs, I am told, has just crossed by the Muar and Triang Rivers, the mouth of the Triang being a few miles further from Pekan than that of the Bra. The shortest crossing of all is said by the Malays to be by the Muar, Rumpin and Mentiga Rivers.\n\nWe have crossed the Peninsula by probably the longest route, unless the ascent of the Muda and descent of the Patani Rivers be longer and feasible. The Bernam river, the largest\nin some senses of those flowing into the Straits of Malacca, is the furthest North of those rivers which, rising in the main range, flow East and West to the Straits of Malacca, both the Krian and Muda Rivers being stated to take their rise in mountains other than the main chain. The Pahang River again is universally admitted to be the longest navigable river on either side of the Peninsula, and though we did not descend the centre or parent stream, the Jelei, there is probably not very much difference in navigable length between that and the Lipis, and there is no recognised crossing from the western to the eastern side of the range which would take the traveller to the head waters of the Jelei, nor any easily navigable river on the western side that would lead up to a point on the western slopes of the main chain opposite to the source of the Jelei. When it is considered that the measured distance on the map from Kuala Bernam to Kuala Pahang is, as the crow flies, one hundred and seventy miles, the route by which we have travelled covering a distance of four hundred and two miles ascending the largest river on the western side of the Peninsula and descending the longest on the eastern, may be considered fairly direct.\n\nThe Straits Government steamer Sea Belle arrived on the 7th, and as I was not able to leave and Captain Giles seemed to be seriously ill, I sent him on to Singapore in the Sea Belle on the 8th instant.\n\nMr. Lister and I remained at Pekan till the 14th May. In that time we saw something of the country in the immediate neighbourhood of Pekan, and had many opportunities of talking to Malays of all ranks on matters concerning Pahang. The Raja Muda of Pahang (brother of the Yam Tuan), who had arrived in the Sea Belle, landed on the 8th, and I had the pleasure of taking him to the Balei (Audience Hall) and seeing him reconciled to his brother. On two other evenings I had interviews with the Yam Tuan, and he took us to his principal house, and let us see the jogret danced by ladies of his own household. I described these dances and the gamelan accompaniment in an early number of the Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. I noticed that on these occasions the company of onlookers was much more select than when I first saw the dances, but, as before, the\namusement was continued till nearly daylight.\n\nOn the 14th, at 1 p.m., the Yam Tuan, the Raja Muda and all the Chiefs came over to our raft to bid us good-bye, the Yam Tuan with his usual generosity giving something to every member of my party. At 2 p.m. we left in the Sea Belle's launch and boats, while a salute was fired from some guns in front of the new mosque, and the Sultan's flag, which he had lowered on our arrival eight days before, was re-hoisted.\n\nThe tide had nearly run out when we started, and we only just managed to get the launch out of the river, reaching the Sea Belle (lying a long way out) at 4 p.m. We arrived at Singapore at 8 a.m. on the 15th.\n\nI cannot close this journal without remarking that, having journeyed through nearly all the Malay States, I have never met with elsewhere such courtesy as we experienced from all classes in Pahang. I could only regret my inability to make any adequate return for the hospitality and kindness of the Yam Tuan.\n\nIt is stated that the mouth of the Pahang River is unapproachable in the North-East monsoon and that Pahang is shut off from communication with the outer world (except by a few jungle paths across the main range of the Peninsula) for six months in the year. I cannot say whether that is true or not, but it is likely, and even in the best of weather no vessel of any size can get near Kuala Pahang, while only steam launches of the lightest draught can, in the best weather, get up to Pekan at all times of the tide. There is, however, an easy way to open this rich country, and that is by the construction of a road, one hundred and thirty miles long, from Johor Bharu, exactly opposite the Johor end of the Singapore-Kranji Road, to Peikan. About seventy miles of this road would pass through Johor territory, and the rest through Pahang. A first class bridle-road could be constructed in eighteen months for less than $150,000, and it could at any time be widened into a cart-road or converted into a tramway or light railroad. This would put Singapore and its resources in direct communication with the lower country of Pahang, besides tapping a long stretch of land, both in Johor and Pahang, useful for the cultivation of low country tropical products.\nA town should be established at the junction of the [illegible] and Pahang river, as a centre for the trade of the metalliferous country, while the present road from [illegible] Lumpur (the terminus of the Selangor railway) to Ginting Bidei should be continued down the Pahang side of the main range to Bentong and Pinjum, or some nearer point on the Pahang river. The cost of these roads would be insignificant in comparison with the advantages they would bring to Pahang, and in a lesser degree to Johor and Selangor; but if it were possible to get the work done under the present regime, it may be doubted whether those who now direct the affairs of Pahang would be able to utilize their opportunities for the best interests of the State.\n\nF. A. SWETTENHAM.\n\nPahang, 16th May, 1855.\nTHE OBJECT AND RESULTS OF A DUTCH EXPEDITION INTO THE INTERIOR OF SUMATRA IN THE YEARS 1877, 1878, AND 1879,\n\nBY\n\nM. A. L. VAN HASSELT.\n\n[The following paper has been translated from the French by Mr. R. N. Bland, C. S. The original will be found in the second Volume of the Proceedings of the Third International Geographical Congress (held at Venice in September 1881), published by the Italian Geographical Society. No account, it is believed, has been published in English of the Dutch Mid-Sumatra Expedition and, in the absence of an English version of their official reports, it is hoped that Mr. Van Hasselt and his companions will not object to the publication of this translation, which has been undertaken unavoidably without their consent being first obtained.]\n\nA short time after the Commission of the Netherlands Geographical Society had decided upon a scientific expedition into the interior of Sumatra, I was, by virtue of my office, as Government \"Controleur\" at Soepajang, invited by the above-named Commission to take charge of one of the sections into which the expedition had been divided. Although convinced of the great difficulties of the task about to be entrusted to me, I thought it my duty not to refuse so honourable a mission.\n\nFrom February, 1877, to March, 1879, we remained in the districts that had been assigned to us, and though not able to apply \"Veni, vidi, vici\" to ourselves, we nevertheless collected a mass of details regarding the country, of which, on our return, it was our privilege to render an account.\n\nThose who are acquainted with the work in which are united the results of the Sumatra expedition, and which, thanks to the efforts of our Commission, has taken so high a place at this Geographical Congress, may have observed that our labours are not yet ended.\nWhile we were still occupied with our report, the Netherlands Society received an invitation from the Central Commission of this Congress, to send its representatives to the ancient City of the Doges. Amongst the delegates of our Society to this Congress where so many illustrious geographers and famous travellers were to meet, the honour of representing the Sumatra Expedition, fell upon two of its Members, Mr. D. D. Veth and myself. I was specially entrusted to explain in this place the object of the Netherlands Scientific Expedition into the interior of Sumatra, and the results arrived at.\n\nI would ask, at starting, to be allowed to refer to the published portion of the work compiled on the return of the Expedition, by its Members. I trust I may be permitted to state briefly what was known of the interior of Sumatra previous to our Expedition, and what has been done by us to extend this knowledge. Various circumstances had within recent years contributed to awaken attention to Sumatra, and our experience of the country and its people was called in to supply the existing gaps. Up to the end of the 18th century Marsden's book* was the only work comprising everything which at that epoch was known of Sumatra, but after that time, the scientific researches of several later travellers had accumulated knowledge and discovered new facts with regard to the Eastern Coast; these were most notably Junghuhn,\u2020 Van der Tuuk, Solomon M\u00fcller, A. H\u00f6mer, Van Oort and Korthals, Oosthoff, Teysman, Cordes, Ludeking, and lastly the Italian traveller Beccari. In the branch of geographical research, Beyerinck and Cluyseenaer chiefly distinguished themselves, and in the region of topography and geology, the Engineers Van Diijk de Greve and Verbeck. For Bengoolen and the Lampung districts we had the data of Major Steck, the travellers Du Bois and Zollinger, General K\u00f6hler, the philologist Van der Tuuk, and various public officials of Netherlands\n\n* History of Sumatra, London, 1783, 1784, 1811, 49.\n\u2020 The titles of all works and articles in Reviews treating of Sumatra will be found at the end of a paper upon this Island by Professor P. J. Veth, reprinted in the Statistical and Geographical Dictionary of Netherlands India, Amsterdam, 1873, p. 777 et seq.\nIndia. Until Marsden's time the extent of the important kingdom of Palembang was little known, but the wars and military operations on a small scale which were the inevitable result of the collapse of the Sultanate and submission to the Netherlands authority, have, within the last half-century, increased our information with regard to this important country. To this the writings of Salmond, Presgrave, Court, de Stuerler Pr\u00e6torius, Gramberg, Teysman, Wallace, Mohnick and de Pruys Van der Hooven have especially contributed.\n\nOn the North of Palembang, are situated the kingdoms of Djambi, Indragiri and Kampar, of which the first is reckoned as a dependency of Palembang. The second is tributary to the Sultan of Lingga and consequently considers itself as within the jurisdiction of the Riouw Residency, whilst Kampar, formerly part of the ancient kingdom of Siak, now acknowledges the authority of the Residency of the East Coast of Sumatra. This part of the interior had never, previously to our Expedition, been thoroughly explored, and of the two rivers\u2014Kampar, and Indragiri or Konantan\u2014our specific knowledge was limited to their mouths and the immediate vicinity. The Residency on the East Coast embraced in 1873 the dependencies of the ancient Sultanate of Siak; after that date many now highly flourishing agricultural undertakings were established, chiefly at Deli and Langkat, and our acquaintance with this part of the island has thus been increased. Finally, the circumstance to which science is indebted for so much information with regard to the ancient kingdom of Acheen and its people, is no other, alas, than the long war with all its attendant evils, which is now said to be over,\u2014having led to a peace by no means assured, owing to the spirit of hatred existing amongst the vanquished. Sumatra now belongs wholly to Netherlands India. In reality, however, there is in the centre and on the East Coast, a large extent of country in which the rule of the Netherlands is still a fiction, but even there its influence has been daily extending for some years.\n\nThe Coast of Acheen in the North; Tapanouli and the West Coast, down to the borders of Mount Barisan; Benkoulen, the Lampong districts and Palembang to the South; the Coasts of Siak, Deli and Langkat to the N. E.\u2014these, gentle-\nmen, are the provinces now subject to our administrative system. Notwithstanding the researches of the travellers I have already mentioned, there remained a wide extent of country in the centre of the Island which was still, for the most part, if not entirely, *terra incognita*.\n\nThe maps of this region showed very inaccurately the configuration of the ground, the topography of the mountains, the courses of the rivers, the geological aspect and fertility of the soil, and the facilities for transport by land and water. With regard to all this and many other questions of ethnography, language and natural history, the works written upon Sumatra left the explorer painfully in the dark. Thus matters stood when our representative, Colonel Versteeg, conceived the idea of exploring these unknown regions.\n\nScarcely anything was known of the river, which, with its many affluents, traverses Djambi, except that its source lies south of the highlands of Padang, and a few other facts gathered in the interests of navigation. Djambi, the Sultan of which was a nominee of the Netherlands India Government, and where a Netherlands official acted as Political Agent, was looked upon as a dependency of the Province administered by the Resident of Palembang.\n\nDjambi was as much unknown to us as Central Africa was to our fathers. Nevertheless there was more than one reason for desiring more intimate knowledge. Most of the Central Districts were celebrated for the beauty of their scenery, their unequalled richness of soil and the industry and pleasant disposition of their inhabitants.\n\nIn 1869, after the existence of rich seams of coal on the banks of the Ombilin (the upper waters of the Indragiri) had been discovered by Greve, an Engineer, who died in the midst of his labours, serious efforts were made to provide means for the transport of this \"black gold.\" The country lying between the coal beds and the West Coast was explored by a band of engineers under the orders of M. Cluyseenaer. They published a large work and detailed maps, but though this was useful from a scientific point of view, the estimated cost of constructing and working a railway to the West Coast was so considerable, that there could be no hope of putting such an idea into execution. This, then, was one of the most\npowerful reasons for selecting this portion of the centre of Sumatra as the chief aim of the researches of our expedition. The more so, as the Government was willing to encourage travelling in all these countries, except Korintji, which, for political reasons, was closed to travellers. All the reports of the Government officials as to the attitude of the natives were favourable, and the Government itself gave full support to the undertaking of our Society by large contributions both of money and stores. The actual state of affairs, however, as we found afterwards, differed widely from what had been hoped for in Holland during the preparations for our expedition. Our companion, Schouw Santvoort, who afterwards died at Djambi, experienced this at starting, when making his perilous expedition across the island in a canoe; and when later we endeavoured to visit the petty states of Manangkabo, which divide the Netherlands territory in the highlands of Padang from the great kingdom of Djambi, we were obliged to beat a precipitate retreat owing to the hostile attitude of the Prince of Si Gountour;* and the news of the unfavourable disposition of the above-named States spread with such rapidity, that the Government thought it prudent to forbid our penetrating further into the States of Rantau, Barouk and Djambi from the west. We were therefore obliged to turn our steps towards the east. But there also, we soon discovered, when we endeavoured to explore the District of Limoun, a part of the Djambi territory, that all the original reports had been dictated by an unjustifiable optimism, and that even when a friendly chief lent us his support, the general feeling of the natives was too hostile to allow us to shew ourselves any longer without military escort, and still less, of course, to attempt any scientific researches.\n\n* Forbes, the Naturalist, two years later, failed to penetrate into Djambi. He was advised \"not to attempt to enter without the mandate of the Sultan,\" meaning not the Sultan recognised by the Dutch Government, but the previous deposed ruler, who had taken up his court in the interior of the country and whom all the Djambi people recognised. This was very disappointing, but I had fared no worse than the Dutch Mid-Sumatra Expedition, which, two years before, had been advised to turn back at that same place.\"\u2014Forbes Eastern Archipelago, 253.\u2014Ed.\nWhat then was the actual condition of Djambi? In 1834, the Netherlands Government had signed a treaty with the Sultan, who, no longer feeling himself able to cope with his discontented subjects, had made the first advances. But when in 1855, Ratou Ahmad Natsarouuddin succeeded him, difficulties arose, resulting in a military expedition to Djambi, which, by an attack on the Kraton, drove out the Sultan. The Government appointed Sultan Ahmad as his successor, and was satisfied by erecting a small fort, in which a weak garrison was stationed, leaving the conduct of the new Sultan to be controlled by a Political Agent. The expelled Sultan, generally known as Soutan Taha, retired to the interior, where, fixing his residence at Telok Perdah on the Batang Hari, near the mouth of the Tabir, he managed to attract a number of followers.\n\nHis authority, though insignificant, was recognised by all the Chiefs along the Hari and its tributaries as far as the mouth of the Tembesi.\n\nSultan Ahmad, lacking the power to make himself respected, was obliged to submit to the existing state of things and to conclude a treaty of amity with his predecessor, by which the boundaries of the territory of each were fixed.\n\nMeanwhile, the resentment of Soutan Taha against the Europeans who had deposed him did not diminish, and he did not cease to incite revolt among all who could be considered friendly towards the Netherlands Government.\n\nThe unfortunate results of such a state of things were, as might have been expected, experienced by our comrades, who in a steam-launch were engaged in making a survey of the rivers; they were obliged to suspend their labours owing to the hostile attitude of the natives, who prevented their further advance. As I have already stated, the expedition had been divided into two parties, one of which was detailed to explore the highlands, the other to survey the river Djambi and its affluents. The leader of the latter was Mr. S. Schouw Santvoort, an officer of the Netherlands Navy, who, on his decease, was succeeded by Lieutenant C. H. Cornelissen. A steam-launch was placed at their disposal,\u2014a boat perfectly suited to the work in hand owing to its dimensions and its small draught of water. The other members of the\nparty were Mr. Makkink, the pilot, and Mr. Hermans, the engineer, afterwards succeeded by Mr. Snijdewind.\n\nAs for myself, I was at the head of the other party, assisted by the Civil Engineer, Mr. D. D. Veth, who was entrusted with the geographical, geological and meteorological investigations, as well as the preparation of negatives for photographs, and by Mr. Son T. Snelleman, whose province was zoology in its higher branches. Ethnology and the study of languages fell to my share.\n\nIn summing up the results of our researches in this marvellous country, I will first deal with geography, as this subject, at a Geographical Congress like the present, should be given the first place.\n\nIt seems superfluous to explain the success which crowned the efforts of Messrs. Veth, Cornelissen and Santvoort; with the exception of quite a small portion, the courses of the Hari and its chief affluent, the Tembesi, were minutely surveyed. It was thus discovered that the Hari, on quitting the Highlands of Padang, flows due North, whence it follows that the furthest point navigable for large boats, is much nearer to the coal mines of Ombilin than it appeared to be on former maps; so much so that the Hari is of as much importance, as a highway for the transport of minerals to the East Coast, as the river Indragiri itself. In surveying the southern part of the Padang up-lands it was discovered that the rivers Mamoun and Pottar belong in no way to the Kouantan basin, but are affluents quite distinct from the Hari. But most notably in the survey of Lebong was the inaccuracy of former surveys made apparent.\n\nThe mountains of the interior of Sumatra have been described with great exactness by Mr. Veth in the 2nd part of our work, which also contains all the geological and meteorological records. The large collection of photographs of the country and of the people taken by him, are assuredly not the least part of the labours which have helped to extend our imperfect knowledge of Sumatra and its inhabitants. Again, amongst the things which we were enabled to bring back with us, I must mention an ethnographical collection* of more\n\n---\n\n* This collection is placed in the Royal Ethnographical Museum at Leyden.\nthan 500 objects, almost the whole of which have been reproduced in the 3rd part of our work. We trust that they will give a true idea of the life and customs of the Malays, set forth as they are in thirteen chapters of our ethnographical description. In my linguistic researches, I set myself as much as possible to note words and to collect manuscripts.\n\nAs to these latter, I frequently had them read and explained to me, in order to learn the real meaning and the proper pronunciation of words. The difficulties I had to overcome will be evident to all those who will take the trouble to examine the word-lists of the Rawas and Lebong (known as the Redjang) dialects, and the songs, puzzles and proverbs which I gathered from the lips of the people themselves, as well as the Manangkabo, Mouroi-Batou and Touankouman Tjeredeg manuscripts. Besides, I was fortunate enough to gather complete information about the figure-characters of the Rentjoung as well as the method of spelling and writing them.\n\nThis figure-writing owes its name to the manner in which the words are engraved with the point of a knife upon strips of bamboo.\n\nI was, on several occasions, able to gather interesting information with regard to the aborigines of this part of the country\u2014the Koubous\u2014and I am in a position to state this curious fact, viz., that their language, which at the first glance appears to differ entirely from Malay, appears on closer investigation to be almost the same language as that of the Malays who inhabit the Koubou district. Only, the pronunciation of the Koubous is harsher, and their peculiarity of expression takes the form of a dialect.\n\nWe were lucky enough to obtain some valuable botanical specimens, and some other fortunate finds go to show that our researches were not altogether fruitless. But most remarkable of all were the results of our zoological investigations. We brought back 30 mammals, 285 birds, 173 reptiles and amphibians, 385 fish, 5 to 6 thousand insects, including 323 species of lepidoptera, and a large number of molluscs.*\n\n* The greater part of this collection is now in the Royal Museum of Natural History at Leyden.\nAmongst these animals, there are many new species, especially amongst the insects of which many species had never previously been observed in Sumatra. Looking at this large number of animals collected in a comparatively short space of time, one might be led into the mistake of supposing that the formation of such a collection would be an easy matter. Without counting the difficulty of preparing and packing up most of the specimens, the very hunting for them was attended with many obstacles, and involved great loss of time. The richness of the tropical fauna has passed into a proverb, not without reason, but like most treasures, it must be sought after out of the beaten track, and it is only little by little that the paths leading to the hidden treasures of nature are to be discovered.\n\nIn giving the preceding r\u00e9sum\u00e9, I have accomplished the task allotted to me, but permit me now to introduce you in imagination, for a few moments at least, to the countries visited by my companions and myself at the time that we traversed these uncultivated regions, deeply impressed with their unique beauty. I will choose those pages of our journal which describe our ascent of the peak of Korintji, or In Irapura, the highest mountain in Sumatra, and one of the highest volcanoes in the Indian Archipelago. We were in the country of the \"twelve kotas,\" a district bounded on the S.W. by the above-named mountain, and as before ourselves no European, and still less any native, had ever attempted the ascent, the preparations for our departure occupied some space of time. Our first idea was to take with us native carriers, called koulis, but as it was too risky to set out with our necessary baggage without knowing anything about the nature of the ground, or even if it were possible to reach the summit, we took the precaution of sending some explorers on ahead as an advance-guard. The superstitious nature of these people, however, so excited their imagination that they returned to us with all sorts of extravagant stories of the inaccessible rocks they had seen, and the fearful monsters they had met. A second attempt on their part was more successful, and although uncertain as to being able to reach the highest point, we set out on the 5th December, 1877, full of ardour and determination. Besides\nthe coolies, we were accompanied by the two guides who had conducted the exploring parties, and by the Touankou of Dourian Taroung, an intelligent chief, with two of his followers. Each koulis carried 8 chupaks (4\u00bd kil.) of rice, whilst the two guides and the chief's followers carried between them 40 chupaks. Besides rice, each had to carry a part of the baggage necessary for such a long stay in the jungle: firstly, our camp-beds, and klambous, or mosquito curtains, articles not less indispensable than a change of clothes in case of rain; some simple cooking utensils, and some tinned provisions, to afford a change in our principal diet, viz., rice; these constituted our equipment, together with the other part of our baggage, consisting of instruments for making geographical and atmospheric observations, whilst those necessary for the collection of plants and animals were not wanting, and finally 2 chairs and some guns and ammunition completed the whole. Every portion of our baggage was carefully wrapped up in tarpaulins, which, fastened together, served as a roof for our shelter at night. Clad in the simple dress suitable for a wandering life in these wild regions, we set out, and our first task was to clear a path with our wood-knives for the koulis. These carriers, who, in Sumatra, are accustomed to carrying their burdens on their heads, would never have been able to get along in the small space sufficient for persons not laden, and would have been liable every moment to get caught in the lianes and thorny branches spreading out in every direction overhead, if the guides had not formed a regular bed, so to speak, for the long line of koulis following them. We were soon obliged to quit the path on account of the unfavourable nature of the ground, and to continue our march along the bed of a river, a change which considerably diminished our speed and compelled our koulis to drop a long distance behind. When we left the water to take again to dry land, our first care, while waiting for the koulis to rejoin us, was to look around to see if there was anything worth carrying off. We perceived an object which we were far from expecting to find in such a place, namely a human skull, which projecting out of the water was gazing at us with hollow orbits. Approaching, we discovered the thigh bones belonging to the same individual,\na Malay, who two years previously had been banished from his negari on account of leprosy. Ten souki of rice had been set apart for him, and he had betaken himself in this direction provided with an axe, a chopper, a wallet containing tobacco and sirih, and a flint and tinder. Thus equipped, he had begun to climb the great mountain, the Peak of Korintji in order to seek among the mountain-spirits a cure for his frightful malady.* He may, perhaps, have reached the summit, but it would seem that the spirits did not grant his wish. Though it may seem inhuman to treat fellow creatures in this way, we must remember that the instinct of preservation, in countries where the population is too often decimated by epidemics, leads easily to measures of this kind. We perched the skull, blanched by the alternate action of air and water on the end of a pole by the riverside, so as to find it easily on our return, feeling sure that no one would come in the interval to dispute with us this strange product of the soil. We followed the path which led from the stream towards the mountain slopes, and which was nothing but a broad track formed by elephants and rhinoceroses. This brought us at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon to Timbeuloun. There, we found such an excellent resting place for the night, amidst a conglomeration of projecting volcanic rocks, that we resolved not to push on further, and all the more so because the koulis were still far behind. It was only an hour afterwards that the first arrived, and as their number gradually increased, we had to listen to confused accounts of the difficulties they had undergone, and the misfortunes they had met with.\n\nThe short time remaining before sunset was occupied in following up for a bit the course of the river, and not far from our encampment, we came across a stream, the limpid water of which dashed down from a height of 20 feet between\n\n* Among Malay races mountain-tops are regarded as places of seclusion and penance, as being the abode of powerful spirits.

The water dripped ceaselessly from trailing creepers and from the rocks which overhung the cataract. Everything around was damp, the air chill, and the silence, which weighed like lead upon the whole scene, was unbroken, save for the monotonous noise of the falling drops. In the meantime some of our koulis began to cut down young trees and branches, and to drag them to the place where we intended to form our bivouac. The lopped branches formed the supports of our dwelling-place, which, thanks to the natural shelter we had found, was for once quickly enough put up, and in which, besides our baggage, there was space enough to lodge our followers. A little distance on our left, a large fire was lighted at which our cook busied himself in preparing a meal as frugal as it was welcome. A second fire was lighted in front of the hut, its tall flames casting such fantastic shadows around that we had no fear of being disturbed by any wild beast. After long marches, such as we made nearly every day of our expedition, one is not much disposed to prolong the evening after having dined. The conversation soon begins to flag, and the slightest hint is sufficient to convince the company of the advantage, nay the necessity, of going to rest. We found this to be so, and whilst the koulis were, according to their custom, squatting round the fire engaged in animated conversation, we were stretching our wearied limbs on our camp-beds, which though very simple, made a much more comfortable bed than the bare ground. The next morning we made haste to continue our journey, and just allowing enough time to cook a few handfuls of rice, which with ship\u2019s biscuit formed our breakfast, we were on our way by half-past 6 o\u2019clock.\n\nWe still followed the track formed by the pachyderms, which led us upwards to the north of the mountain. We advanced very slowly, having continually to clear the path of fallen trees, and twisted creepers.\n\nWe marched in front with the guides, and towards 11 o\u2019clock we arrived at a hut which had previously sheltered them, but which we could not now make use of, on account of its distance from any water we could drink, and also because our day\u2019s task was by no means done. At about 3 o\u2019clock in the afternoon we came to the last hut occupied by the guides,\nrather more favourably situated by reason of its proximity to water. We commenced at once, therefore, to establish ourselves there, and after we had cleared and levelled a space of 6 m\u00e8tres long by 2 broad, we put up a long shed or pondok.\n\nI will not weary you with a too detailed account of our undertaking. Suffice to say that after several fruitless attempts to push forward, we resolved on the 7th December to leave our kouhis behind with the baggage, and to endeavour ourselves, each escorted by two men with axes, to reach the summit by different routes.\n\nOn the 8th of December, about half-past twelve, I was only about 200 m\u00e8tres from the summit, when my guide, stumbling over a loose stone, fell on his face. Turning round, I found him sitting on a rock, his mouth was bleeding and his knee and arm were bruised. At this moment a violent peal of thunder, with at least a hundred reverberating echoes, broke over our heads. My guide instantly began to urge a return. \"Let us go back, Tuan, since we know the way. It is beginning to get dark and we are going to have heavy rain.\" A second thunder-clap, as loud as the first, sounded almost as he spoke.\n\n\"The mountain is angry,\" he continued \"do not let us wait longer.\" Looking up towards the summit where a short time before a picturesque crest of jagged rocks had stood out above the gravel slopes of the mountain, I could perceive nothing but a black and threatening cloud. There was nothing for us but to return. But this was not so easy, the stones which previously had seemed so solid, broke away every moment under our feet, bringing down others in their fall.\n\nArriving at the spot where we had quitted the forest, we resolved to follow up the course of the river as well as possible as far as the cataract just above our hut. In this we succeeded, and at about 2 o'clock in the afternoon we reached our bivouac.\n\nOn the sixth day after leaving the plain, we at last got to the top. It was on my hands and feet that I climbed the last part, and the view that then met my eyes made me start back with surprise, what I had taken for the top was but the narrow rim of a yawning crater with precipitous sides. More\nthan 1,000 m\u00e8tres below, water and sulphur were seething and giving off vapours, which filled the cavity for moments at a time, and then lifted so as to reveal to us the whole bottom of the abyss. This floor presented a sandy surface, with lakes of sulphur here and there, easily recognisable by their yellow colour, and a number of small arteries connecting them. To my right and left the cliffs were more elevated, and prevented my seeing the surrounding country, leaving only a view of the summits of mountains in the distance. Notwithstanding the grand spectacle presented by the high lands of Padang, I could not, but express a feeling of disappointment at our situation, for I saw that it would be very difficult to make our way round the lofty and rugged edge, whose exterior slope, at an angle of not less than 45\u00b0 was composed of such loosely holding shingle, that a single step was sometimes enough to send immense stones rolling down the precipice.\n\nA few moments later M. Veth rejoined me, and after having satisfied himself that the rocks on our right were absolutely inaccessible, he proceeded to try and discover, more to the south, a spot level enough to set up the tripod rest of our telescope, by means of which we were to observe the surrounding country. After a quarter of an hour's climb he called for the instruments; the Mandor, or head of the koulis, with his men, advanced a few steps, but then sat down, declaring that they were giddy. Only two coolies ventured to follow me to the spot where my companion was waiting. Climbing over sharp rocks, we at last reached a level space of a few m\u00e8tres. Our observations, however, had to be very brief, for big clouds collecting on all sides hindered all exploration. To the S. E. towards the Gounoung Toujouk (seven mountains) we noticed a large lake shut in by serrated peaks, forest clad. In bygone ages this mountain, had evidently been a gigantic volcano, such as the Peak of Korintji at the present day.\n\nN. W. from the foot of the Gounoung Toujouk, the first rice fields of Korintji are situated on the banks of a considerable torrent. These fields were flooded and shone in the sunshine like polished plates of metal. Lastly, when a big cloud suddenly intercepted our view, we noted the state of the\nbarometer and the thermometer. The first indicated 495 millim\u00e8tres, the second 7\u00b08 C. On the following day we succeeded in reaching the highest summit of the mountain.\n\nWe had been forced to send back five coolies who had broken down, and even the Chief of Dourian Taroung himself was obliged to leave us through illness. As our provisions were sensibly diminishing, and we were afraid that the rest of the coolies would not be able to stand the fatigue and cold much longer, we decided to return.\n\nI must not quit this subject without making some observations upon the character of the fauna and flora of this volcano, which rises to a height of 3,600 m\u00e8tres.\n\nAs far as the place where we spent the first night, the forest generally resembled those we had already so often traversed, containing a considerable number of large trees linked together by strong creepers and heavy rotan-manau. The kalo rises side by side with the warungin, the sacred tree of the Hindoos, the koubang, the siamouk, or milk-tree, with its white bark, and the wild kabau or kapok. The undergrowth consists of large-leaved bamboos, with knotted stems which interlace in every direction, of the dahun katari, much used in Malay households, of the balumking with its edible flowers, and a large variety of ferns and grasses.\n\nAdvancing upwards, towards our second halting place, bamboos were replaced by varieties of powar, whilst along the river banks the djombou-ajjar were met with, and further on, in the jungle, meranti and other straight-stemmed trees. At this elevation rattan is still common enough, but as in the case of the lianes, it is finer and weaker than in the lowlands.\n\nAscending higher still, the trunks of the various species of the kali, and the djirah-pidang diminish in size, and we notice that they are twisted, knotted, and covered with different kinds of moss. The rattans and climbing plants become more and more rare, grasses take the place of the powar, to be replaced in turn by the thick-stemmed pakou-rasam, a species of fern which, together with other volcanic plants, is found right up to the summit.\n\nAbove a height of 2,500 m\u00e8tres, no trees worthy of the name are to be met with, but various kinds of flowering, or\nsweet-smelling shrubs, such as the liwang, the bark of which has an odour of orange-flowers, as also the flowers, the leaves, and the fruit of the sarikmandjari, a number of sharp edged grasses, and several graceful species of nepenthe. At the highest point, which exceeds 3,000 m\u00e8tres, wherever a little vegetable soil is collected in corners of the porous rock, are to be seen, besides the plants already mentioned, the lobak with its yellow flowers, and the tjapo-gounong, whose little white flowers and pointed velvet leaves remind us of the Edelweiss of the Alps. I will not go into the question as to whether the presence of these plants proves the fertility of the soil, but it is certain that the soil of the gentle slope to the east and to the north-east of the Peak, is singularly rich, and perfectly suited to agricultural enterprise.\n\nIn digging the ground for the foundations of our hut, as well as in places where landslips had occurred, I ascertained that the vegetable soil was in places more than a m\u00e8tre in depth. But in order to obtain satisfactory results from the cultivation of this district, it would first of all be necessary to supplement its present scanty population with a supply of labourers from Hindostan, Java, or elsewhere.\n\nThe result of our observations of animal life, after leaving the foot of the mountain, may be stated in a few words. The large animals did not show themselves, which indeed they rarely do, for in the depths of these vast forests animal life seems extinct. The tracks of the rhinoceros were only met with up to a height of 2,000 m\u00e8tres, those of the elephant not beyond 1,500 m\u00e8tres; wild chamois frequent the inaccessible rocks, and choose out those crevices and grottos which by their projections afford them cover from the wind and rain. Up to the very top we found tracks and droppings of this antilocarpus sumatrensis. With regard to insects, we remarked at the summit, some bees, gad flies, some small black insects under stones, and here and there a butterfly. We also met with a species of brown pigeon, perhaps the Treron Nasica, and some smaller birds with green wings and red heads. Leeches were only perceived up to a height of 1,300 m\u00e8tres, while spiders, especially those of the family of Lycoecides do not go higher than 3,000 m\u00e8tres.\nWe came down the mountain much more slowly than we had gone up. Still the rate at which we were going prevented us from bestowing sufficient attention on the natural features by which we were surrounded, and on the peculiarities of the mysterious forests in which the struggle for existence is ceaselessly going on\u2014a struggle which man is often unable to explain.\n\nWhat a delightful feeling it is to reach, at the close of day, an open space where one can give oneself wholly over to the repose and comfort of a bivouac. Many of these places will remain indelibly in our memories. Thus on the evening of the 5th October, we arrived at Sungai Sapi, a most picturesque spot. Our people were already busy putting up a shelter for us under the river bank. The banks rose sheer up both sides, leaving only a clear view of the water up and downstream. Our hut was quickly built on the stony soil of the upper part of the river-bed, which was then dry. Soon the fire for preparing our repast was lit, whilst near at hand resounded the axes engaged in felling the trees destined for building our pondok or hut. All around is movement, not, however, to be of long duration, for as soon as the strictly necessary labour is over, everyone makes himself as comfortable as possible, in order to make the most of this charming resting-place.\n\nLet us take the trouble to more minutely examine the ground around us. By the path leading to the river, and at a short distance from it, we notice coffee-bushes, durians, mangosteens, and jambu-trees. It is evident that these are not forest trees, but are the living remains of a village, which, like so many others, has disappeared. Not a house whose inhabitants might have told us their story has been left standing; nothing has survived but these few fruit trees which nature will reclaim in like manner, so as to completely wipe out every vestige of the past.\n\nTo our left, the river flows slowly over a bed of stones, and not far away is hidden from us by a bend.\n\nOn our right hand the scene is very different. The water flows impetuously and dashes itself down from a high rock into a deep basin, falling in a broad sheet with a continual roar, like an avalanche of pearls, and bringing with\nit an icy current of air. It would be impossible to imagine a more picturesque bit of water scenery than this natural basin. As long as the day-light lasted we made notes, or arranged the collections made during the day.\n\nThe approach of night forced us to give up our work, and we placed our chairs at the water's edge enveloping ourselves in fragrant Havana smoke. The subdued effects of twilight are unfortunately unknown in these countries. It is as though the sun were in haste to hide himself, and in this enchanting spot the night fell suddenly and covered all our landscape with its black veil.\n\nThen almost at once we heard the leader of the insect orchestra take up his office, and with a diabolic note give the signal to begin. The light of phosphorescent cock-chafers shine fantastically amidst the trees, bats flit like shadows around our resting-place.\n\nThe koulis, who have lighted a second fire on the other side of the hut, are squatting round it, intercepting the light, which thus falls only on a portion of the river and hardly reaches the distorted tree-roots which a land-slip has exposed on the opposite side.\n\nOur rice will soon be ready; our old cook is giving it his whole attention. Clad only in a pair of trousers, he is sitting cross-legged and is with imperturbable gravity stirring his rice with a long spoon. His whole figure is stiff, severe, and rigid, as though it were carved in wood. Of the Malays seated between us and the fire, we can only distinguish the outlines, whilst every feature of their companions who are sitting opposite to us is vigourously brought out by the red gleams, produced by the light of the flaming wood upon their browned faces and bodies. And while they rest themselves, smoking their cigarettes, they listen attentively to one of their number who is telling the history of some previous excursion. Doubtless, nowhere does nature offer more splendid spectacles than in these distant forests. There is no monotony, on the contrary, an infinite variety. Sometimes the surroundings inspire us with calm, at other times we are awed by the stern force with which nature works out her ends. The aspect of water rushing downward from the mountains with ever increasing impetuosity,\ntearing a way for itself through and over the most colossal and massive rocks, is truly terrific.\n\nAnd what shall we say regarding the fine layer of earth, which covers the rock, and which, although often not more than a few centimetres in depth, yet nourishes and gives its vital forces to a forest of gigantic trees, of brushwood and lianes infinitely varied, and wearying the imagination with their diversity of form and colour?\n\nOur European forests cannot be compared with the flora which Sumatra presents to our astonished eyes. Gigantic trees strike their tenacious roots into the earth, or project them into the air, as though nervously defending themselves against the attacks of assailants.\n\nIn straight lines and fantastic curves, branches, leaves, trunks and roots, twist in and out disputing for nourishment; here lianes attach themselves like tightened ropes to the trees, or else twist in spirals round a young tree, whilst there, they are poised without support, cork-screw fashion. What is the meaning of this spiral without a prop? The victim which it formerly entwined, succumbed to its stifling embrace and fell into dust, leaving only the fatal knot which had strangled it. No plant can grow without a struggle: parasites are everywhere, on the bark, on the branches, on the leaves. It may easily be understood how hard it is to recognise the parent amidst this chaos; the parasites climb from branch to branch, until the last leaf disappears, and the last twig, bending beneath their weight, succumbs, and hangs like the powerless arm of a vanquished man. And all this luxuriant verdure, striving to climb on high in order to enjoy the sparkling sun-light, twists about and forms an inextricable network, which only the wood-knife and the axe can unravel. The rattan winds about like a snake between the most delicate stems as well as between the thickest trunks, and rears its spiny head, like a plume, amidst the tops of the loftiest trees.\n\nFrom time to time a bamboo grove presents an agreeable change to the eye. The large stems spring forth majestically, to fall afterwards in graceful curves; sometimes the path is blocked by a fallen tree, which in its heavy fall has dragged down a whole plantation with it, while crushing a\nportion of the forest opposite. Knowing that time with his inevitable scythe will put all things in order, the native in such a case avoids the obstacle, goes round it, and clears himself a new path which rejoins the old one further on.\n\nGloomy obscurity and heavy silence weigh upon these forests, never visited by Europeans, and seldom by Malays. At midday, surrounded by native followers, there should be nothing to alarm one in such a place, nevertheless one lifts one's head with a shudder, when the mysterious stillness is broken by a falling leaf, fluttering down and grazing the tree-branches, or by a loosened stone rolling down a ravine. It is the influence exercised by this tropical nature.\n\nThus in a framework of verdure, the torrent rolls down from rock to rock with foam whiter than snow, until, become at last a cataract, it sways the broad leaf of the pisang, as easily as the lace-like fern. The basin into which it is ever pouring its limpid water contains myriads of shining fish, which find nourishment in the fruit which the torrent brings down with it. And when chance rays of sun-light manage to pierce the dome of verdure, then one's eyes are greeted with a splendour of tints and colours, which one must have seen before one can admit that it is impossible to describe them.\n\nBut other surprises are in store for us in these wild localities. When after marching for several hours, or rather jumping from stone to stone in the bed of a river, one enters the forest, one is struck by the incredible mass of dead leaves which one meets with, and which form a fertile soil for the trees from which they have fallen. All these leaves are covered with a mildew as glossy as silk, delicate as a spider's web, and white as snow, standing out against a dark background. Indeed one is afraid to make a step lest one should destroy in an instant these works of art of such inimitable delicacy and elegance. In the midst of these is enthroned the Giant of the Forest, the malaboumei, a tree whose trunk is a metre and a half in diameter, and which rears its majestic head straight overhead at a height of 100 feet.\n\nIt is natural that one should be singularly impressed by this contrast, or rather by these extremes which meet, as the proverb says, like the first and last pages of a treatise on Botany placed side by side.\nThe tree-trunks are covered with many species of plants, belonging, it is true, to the same family, but varying infinitely in their development. Here are rattans twining round a tree like the boa round its prey. There the akar lamboutou thick as man's arm grows side by side with the rotan emboun as fine as thread.\n\nAs has already been remarked, few large animals are met with in these regions. Sometimes one hears the shrill note of the argus pheasant. Occasionally a monkey is visible leaping and swinging from one branch to another. But as far as the smaller animals are concerned, an attentive explorer may observe much. Amongst insects, we found many whose only means of defence lay in their disguise, creatures which so much resemble, in form and colour, the earth and the plants amongst which they live as to be mistaken for them. They must have had many enemies to be obliged to assume this disguise in order that their species may preserve its vitality.\n\nBefore ending this narrative, I must touch upon the charms which night offers amidst these forests. Hardly has the darkness set in and the stars begun to gleam through the leafy roof than the forest is lighted up by a thousand fires which, at first stationary, seem to be resting in the tree tops in order to afterwards take flight in graceful curves, and at last be lost to sight, like shooting stars.\n\nEven the leaves, the dead twigs, the very soil itself, seem to give forth a phosphorescent radiance. This formless mass covering the earth, which but lately impeded our march, is now enveloped in a mysterious light; we might describe it as an enchanted garden, like those of the Arabian stories, if this simile were not worn threadbare.\n\nIt is unfortunate that this fairy-like scene is marred by the music of cicadae, which far from producing the harmonious sounds which would be appropriate to une belle nuit fantastique, assail our ears with piercing cries, uttered with demoniacal strength and a pertinacity only to be paralleled by the bass notes in this impromptu concert which are supplied by the mountain torrent.\n\nSuch are the sights that nature unfolded to us in Sumatra. It will easily be understood that we shall not readily forget them.\nFurther Notes on the Rainfall of Singapore.\n\nFive years ago I had the privilege of submitting a few notes on the rainfall of Singapore, which appeared in No. 7 of this Journal. I now purpose to add a few more remarks on this interesting study.\n\nIn the last notes above referred to, the registers of two places only were taken into account, viz., those of the old criminal Prison between Brass Bassa and Stamford Roads, for the rainfall in Town, and Mr. Knight's on Mount Pleasant, Thompson Road, for the country; but in 1880, on the removal of the Criminal Prison to its new locality, the former was discontinued, and later on Mr. Knight changing his residence the latter also.\n\nIt, therefore, became necessary to take a more general view, and a table has been prepared of the Mean Annual Rainfall of Singapore as observed at present at seven stations, which, through the kindness of Dr. Rowell, Principal Civil Medical Officer, Straits Settlements, in permitting me to have access to the records, I now have the pleasure of submitting, together with charts shewing the ranges of the Mean Annual Rainfall, and Rainy Days since 1869. It will be an easy matter to continue these charts, say at intervals of five years, and thus arrive at some idea of the law of the rainfall of Singapore.\n\nMr. Skinner in his article on \"Straits Meteorology\" (No. 12 of this Journal), is of opinion that it is \"not too early to endeavour to obtain some results from the series of Rainfall returns\" now to hand, and has ventured to connect certain outbreaks of cholera, beri-beri, &c., with the rainfall. The concluding paragraphs of that article are very hopeful and promising. The chart accompanying this paper apparently bears out his anticipations that \"an excess of rain may be looked for in the years 1884-85,\" for the line is an ascending one; but it requires the tracings of a few more years to get a clear knowledge of the rhythm of the alternations of periods of lesser and greater ascents before\nthe corresponding fallings. For instance, the chart shows a sudden fall in the amount of rain for 1871 and 1872, with a slowly increasing rise up to 1875, followed by a still lower fall in 1877 (the lowest recorded). In 1878 there is almost double the rainfall of 1877, rising still higher in 1879, from which period down to 1883, the annual rainfall was steadily decreasing, but in 1884 it again ascended, and may ascend further if Mr. Skinner's conclusions rest on a sound basis.*\n\nThe continuous and steady improvements in the sanitary condition of Singapore town and suburbs within the last eight years have been so marked, that it would hardly be fair to draw conclusive inferences from the old returns of health by comparing them with those of recent dates, and attributing any differences to the rainfall. For instance, when cholera broke out as an epidemic in 1873 (having been in the first instance imported from Bangkok where the disease was raging virulently) Singapore was suffering badly from want of water, the season was unusually dry, nearly all the wells such as they were\u2014many being mere pits a few feet deep without any protective wall\u2014had almost run dry, the brick conduit for bringing the water from the impounding reservoir was a failure, as the water could not rise in the aqueduct over the canal, so that the poorer people resorted to the filthy canal water when the tide had ebbed. The largest number of cases of cholera occurred in the vicinity of that canal commencing from the Lunatic Asylum, which suffered severely, extending to Kampong Kapor, which was a regular hot-bed for developing, continuing and spreading the disease, and terminating at Rochor. There were also some cases of cholera from Kampong Malacca and the crowded parts of the\n\n* It is certainly well to wait until we have a larger series of annual returns before generalising on such a matter too positively; and this branch of the subject is only touched upon now to invite the attention of all who may keep or study our Meteorological Records. But from the evidence already accumulated the long drought of 1882-3, which ended last August, was, I maintain, clearly to be anticipated; for it closed the solar period dating from the limited rainfall (160 inches) in 1872-3, and the subsidiary dry period, showing the fall of 148 inches only, in 1876-7. An excess of rain may, in the same way, be looked for in the years 1884-5, and still more in 1885-6; but not so great an excess, these years merely closing the subsidiary period of excess from 1879-80 (228 inches).\u2014Journal No. 12 of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, pp. 254-5.\ntown south of the Singapore river, places deficient in water supply, and where sanitation of any sort was never thought of.\n\nThen, again, in 1875-77, outbreaks of cholera in an epidemic form were mainly averted by the untiring exertions of Messrs Baylies and Colson who had charge of the waterworks then in course of completion. They opened up the conduit in several places near the Race Course, and stationed a steam engine at the distal end of the aqueduct and pumped the water across the canal, rendering the precious element available to large numbers of people; and, later on, by the completion of the water-works, good wholesome water was distributed throughout the town, which has helped to produce so marked a change, that since then, cholera or choleraic diarrhoea has not appeared in an epidemic form.\n\nAs regards beri-beri, I think the Medical returns will show a marked falling off in the numbers treated since the removal of prisoners to the new Jail.\n\nThere can be no question that a great many unknown influences are at work on and around this globe of ours which more or less affect the health of its inhabitants. For some time past attention has been drawn to the wonderful spots on the sun, and they have been the subject of study of many observers, but the results must necessarily be slow. That the moon also has a share in some of these influences must be conceded, for it is well known that atmospheric disturbances are more frequent at certain stages of the moon's phases than at others, and quite recently there has been free expression regarding the influences caused or to be caused by the perihelia of certain planets, so that the conclusion is still forced on us, that it is as yet premature to calculate with any certainty on this question; yet every little effort towards helping its solution should be encouraged, and in time the skein which now seems tangled may be unravelled.\n\nIn connection with this line of thought it may be suggested that in this, almost the wealthiest of the British Colonies, it is not too soon to provide for an observatory under an Astronomer and Meteorologist. The equatorial position of Singapore gives to the Astronomer a more interesting\nfield for observations than can be obtained at higher or lower latitudes. But till such an idea is taken up by the powers that be, those who have the means, time and inclination can contribute much information by daily observations of the sun when possible, registering the sun spots, if any, and thus ascertain if there be any connection between their occurrence and our rainfall; and the Principal Civil Medical Officer would also help considerably if he could see his way to having rain gauges and registers kept at Changi or Siranggong (extreme east), Tanjong Karang (west), at the Police stations, Bukit Timah Road 7th mile, and Seliar; a more general average of the rainfall could thus be ascertained. The absence of a station or stations well in the centre of the island is a drawback, the more so as many of the streams running into the impounding reservoir, which supplies the town with its drinking water, are fed by the rains falling on the southern aspect of Bukit Timah. There should be little difficulty in teaching the Police Sergeants in charge of the stations to keep the register.\n\nJ. J. L. WHEATLEY.\n### Table: Rainfall Data for Singapore\n\n| Year | Jany.

Its position as a trading centre has been somewhat interfered with of late years by the rival town of Twatutia \u57c3\u5229\u5927 (situated only a mile or so to the North of Banca), whose growing importance is owing almost entirely to the establishment there of foreign mercantile houses, and to the rapid development of the tea trade, of which Twatutia is the principal mart.\n\nIt is my present object to give a description of the aboriginal tribes living in the hills in rear of Banca extending in various directions towards S\u016b-oh Bay on the East coast, and more especially of those tribes living nearest to the western borderland in the neighbourhood of K\u014dt Chiu \u5c3a\u5c48 formerly a Chinese border outpost, as well as of those residing in the mountains at the back of San Ko Yeng \u6c38\u89d2\u4e09 and to the East also of To Ko Ham \u58a8\u79d1\u5927 extending down to the \"Sylvian and Dodd\" ranges in the vicinity of the \"Petroleum Wells\" discovered by myself in the spring of the year 1865.\n\n* Journal No. 9, pp. 69-84.\nThe Hill Savages of North Formosa are, without doubt, exactly like other human beings in the shape of their bodies and number of their limbs, and although they are as wild as the animals which roam about their country, have no written language of their own, and live in a most primitive style, yet there are no signs of a Darwinian tail, neither do they at all give you the idea that their progenitors were of the monkey species.\n\nThe men are not remarkably tall; in fact I should say that few of them measure over five feet nine inches, and the majority of them are, probably, under five feet six inches. In the South of the island, it is said, the men are of a larger mould than those residing North of Latitude 24 N.\n\nThe complexion of old men of the tribes is very sallow and often swarthy; that of young, healthy warriors much lighter and clearer, but there is observable in the majority of faces a dark tinge not to be seen in the faces of Chinese, not quite so dark as the complexion of mixed descendants of Portuguese settlers in Macao, but resembling more the tint to be seen in the faces of fair-complexioned Japanese. They are, if anything, darker-skinned than ordinary Chinamen who have not been exposed to the sun; but the peculiar strain referred to, does not appear so distinctly in the younger members of the tribe, or so strong, as it does in the complexions of those who have taken an active part in hunting, fighting, and in the hard daily struggle for existence.\n\nThe skin of the darkest savage of the North of the island is not so dark as the complexions of many representatives of Spain, southern France and Italy, and in higher latitudes, many faces of Celtic type shew as dark a hue as that observable in the faces of the aborigines of the North. In old members of the tribes, the colour of the skin assumes a duskier and sallower tint, constant on the frequent exposure to the sun and to the weather, but with all this, there is no similarity of colour to that visible in the faces of African negroes.\n\nThe strain of negro blood was plainly visible in the faces of the wrecked Pellew Islanders, but in the colour\nof the skin and in the texture of the hair of the northern tribes there are no signs of negro extraction. Their hair is invariably dark and lank, not curly or frizzled, their lips are not so thick even as those of Malays, and the high noses possessed by many approach often the European type. With these evidences before us, it is safe to assume that these savages have inherited an intermediate colour not apparently traceable to negro admixture. The diversities of colour in men, whether in a civilised or wild state, have puzzled enquirers, I imagine, up to the present day, and it is impossible to say with any certainty now, after all the speculations and theories enunciated in books on the subject, whether our first parents were created black or fair-skinned. The stronger reasons are in favour of the former colour, in any case the hot rays of the sun seem to have the effect of only tanning the skin brown, even in the tropics, and this effect in Formosa, where, in the valleys, it is extremely hot for more than half the year, would appear to have no hereditary consequence on the colour of young savages who are launched into the world year after year. The colour of the skin of all peoples must necessarily be a guide to descent, for it must be inherited, of course with modifications. I have considered it advisable to allude to this subject to prove that the savages of North Formosa are not apparently directly descended from the Eastern negro section of the human family, specimens of which are to be found in the islands of the South Pacific Ocean. It is well known that there are certain dark curly-headed tribes in the Philippine group, and possibly similar representatives of that class of people may later on be discovered in some of the numerous valleys of Formosa amongst the tribes to the South of the 24th parallel, when the whole of the country between Mount Morrison and the Sylvian Range has been thoroughly explored. The colour of the skin of all the Northern tribes I have seen appears to be of a uniform hue, without any variety, beyond a darker or lighter complexion observable when comparing bronzed and swarthy old men with younger members of the tribe who have never been much exposed to the weather.\n\nThe general contour of the face resembles somewhat that\nof a Malay, but the lips of the Formosan savage are not so thick, neither are their noses (excepting in few instances) quite so flat as those of the Malays whom I have seen at Singapore and in China. It may safely be said that there is nothing in their physiognomy which resembles the Chinese, their natural enemies, whom they imagine to be the only other inhabitants of Formosa or indeed of the world.\n\nOn first meeting a savage of the true type (not beggar savages who are to be found on the borders and often in Chinese villages), you notice immediately the wide difference between him and the Celestial whom you have left on the opposite side of the borders, not only in the shape of his head, but particularly in the expression of the eye, which reminds you more than anything else of the wild and anxious gaze of a Scotch deer-hound. The eyes of most of the young warriors are strikingly black and piercing, they always appear to be on the move, staring to their full extent and gazing with a clear but eager look as it were at some far distant object beyond you. In the eye of the younger huntsmen and warriors, you cannot recognise care, but the look of those in their prime speaks of anxious thought for the morrow and is an index of the general feeling of insecurity, which must frequently and naturally exist amongst men who almost daily encounter dangers from contact with their human enemies, in the shape of neighbouring unfriendly tribes or the wily Chinese invader, as well as at times the wild animals of the forests, on the flesh of which they are, for the most part, dependent for their subsistence. The expression referred to is not one of fear, but denotes rather a life of care and anxiety.\n\nThe head being generally small and round, the face is not particularly large or full. The eyes are very dark-coloured and straight cut, not at all oblique. In those of good-looking young men and women, the lashes are dark and long, eyebrows black, strong and thick, but not overhanging. In some faces they often nearly meet at the root of the nose. They are decidedly a very distinct feature of the face, as beards and whiskers are unknown and a moustache is seldom attempted, though I have seen certain old members of tribes\nwearing a resemblance to one: as a rule all hairs appearing on the chin or cheek are plucked out by the roots, a small pair of tweezers being used for the purpose.\n\nThe shape of the heads of savages varies considerably, though the majority of them appear round and rather small. Their faces are for the most part of a Malayan type; some have a Jewish cast, and again you observe faces whose profiles resemble those of Europeans. I am inclined to think that these differences in physiognomies are attributable to the mixture of Malay, Philippine and Polynesian blood with the original ancient stocks previously existing in the island.\n\nThe men of the northern tribes are in the habit of tattooing the forehead and chin in horizontal lines of about three quarters of an inch in length, and one-sixteenth part of an inch in breadth right in the centre of the forehead from the parting of the hair, which is always in the middle, to the root of the nose.\n\nOn the chin, also, are similar horizontal lines, and these are, as a rule, the only tattoo marks that are visible on the faces of the men. On the body they tattoo slightly, but it is not very general amongst them. The men have also a curious custom of piercing the lobes of their ears. Each lobe has a hole through it, large enough to receive a piece of bamboo about the size of a Manila cheroot. They usually wear therein hollow pieces of young bamboo with tufts of scarlet long-ells sticking out of the opening at the upper end; others insert pieces of what appears to be white cuttle-fish bone, about four inches long, with a disc made of the same material in the outer end. On the foreheads of some of the men may be seen similar flat but round pieces of cuttle-fish bone, fixed there by means of a piece of string round the head or attached to a circlet or wreath of embroidered camlets or native-made cloth. On their small, tight-fitting caps, they frequently fix circular pieces of this white cuttle-fish bone, or whatever it is. It seems to be quite a common article of barter amongst them. They use strings of small beads made of cuttle-fish bone not only as ornaments for their heads and necks, but as a \"circulating medium.\" Necklaces, earrings and trinkets of various kinds are made of it. The\naborigines of the northern and central mountains are immensely fond of all sorts of trinkets. Round the necks of old men and young warriors are seen necklaces of wild boars' tusks and teeth of animals. They are worn often as heirlooms, but principally as symbols of individual prowess. They often load their necks with metal trinkets, cuttle-fish beads, &c., to which they attach numerous little appliances connected with the priming and loading of their matchlocks, a motley sort of collection, which excites the curiosity of the beholder. Every man who possesses a gun (pahhtis) wears round his neck curious-looking priming-flasks full of powder, and over his shoulder, or round his waist, an oblong-shaped case, made of skin, often containing several cylindrical-shaped wooden receptacles full of powder. He has generally about him a small bag containing shot and long iron projectiles almost the size of the little finger, which are slipped down the muzzle of the long-barrelled matchlock on top of the powder without any wad between. Matchlocks, however, are not very common in the interior, and even the border tribes are only scantily furnished with them. The majority of the men are armed with bows and arrows, with which they make good practice at stationary objects. Bowmen wear round their waists a deer skin strap, or arrow-belt, and not a man is without a long knife called tal\u00e1h. Another common appendage is a bag made either of hempen cloth or skin, about four or five inches broad and nine or ten inches long, in which they place dried tobacco leaves. Tobacco grows wild in many parts of the country inhabited by the savages, and in Chinese territory it is cultivated to a large extent in certain districts. The savages simply sun-dry it, then rub it in their hands and place it in their pipes. In this form it is very mild. Foreigners make it into blocks by placing the leaves one above the other; a little water is then sprinkled over them, sometimes a dash of rum, the leaves are then pressed into a compact block, or are compressed into a circular shape about the size of the wrist and tapering to a point at both ends. Tobacco made in this form is tied round tightly together with rope, and is a very good substitute for what is called ship's tobacco. Native-grown tobacco, has been often prepared in this way by sailors on board\nBritish gunboats visiting Tamsui, and has been much appreciated by every one fond of a pipe.\n\nChinese cultivate the tobacco plant, and large quantities are exported in junks to the mainland, where it is \"cured\" according to Chinese taste, and in this form is re-imported for the use of Chinese only. The plant seems to thrive in Formosa luxuriantly, and it is a wonder that no attempt has been made here to manufacture cigars and cheroots for foreign exportation. Judging from the quality and size of the leaf, there ought to be no difficulty in producing cigars equal to those made in Manila.\n\nThe aborigines of the North one and all smoke tobacco. Men and women invariably do so, and even young boys and girls are addicted to this pleasant vice, and as the plant grows wild and Formosa is a feverish and aguish country, it is not astonishing that smoking is such a common habit amongst them. Their pipes are made of hollowed bamboo and the stem (tutu bidnd kui) is also made of very thin bamboo reed, being about half a foot to a foot in length, according to the taste of the owner. The bowls are often very tastefully and prettily carved and are frequently ornamented with pieces of metal. When not in use, the pipe is generally stuck in the hair at the back of the head by both men and women.\n\nThe clothing of these so-called savages living in the lower hills adjoining Chinese territory is, especially in the summer months, very scant. It consists chiefly of a coat, called li-kia resembling very much an enlarged singlet open in the front and as a rule without sleeves. Four straight pieces of native hempen cloth are sewn together two to the back and two in front, leaving room for the arms to pass through, sewn also at the top over the shoulders, but open in front, exposing the chest and stomach. Sometimes they are buttoned across the chest, and sleeves are occasionally worn by border savages. These coats cover the back entirely, and reach down nearly as far as the knees, and although they are usually made of plain, coarse, bleached, hempen cloth, they are almost always embroidered from the waist downwards, or interwoven with either blue or scarlet threads of long-ells, which they obtain from the\nChinese borderers.\n\nThe patterns vary very much, resembling somewhat the carvings to be seen on their pipe stems and not unlike the tattoo lines and bars on the faces of the women. They shew great diversity as well as regularity of design, and if not imitations derived from outside sources, they indicate not only originality but great taste. In addition to the lukus the men wear round their waists a strip of woven hemp four or five inches broad, embroidered in the same way as the lower part of the lukus. This girdle or belt is called habbock, and is worn next to the skin as a rule, but sometimes outside the coat. The lukus and habbock are almost the only articles of clothing worn by the men in the lower ranges of hills, but on the higher levels many wear coats with sleeves, and sometimes clothes made of the skins of animals.\n\nIn the summer months, one often meets men and boys roaming about with absolutely no clothes on at all. Some consider \"full dress\" to consist of a rattan wicker-work closely fitting cap (molu), others strut about all day long with only the belt or habbock round their waists, with the lalao stuck in it.\n\nThe blade of the lalao is about a foot and a half long and is always kept sharp. It is set in a haft of wood, which is usually adorned in the same way as their pipes, with carvings and pieces of metal. The blade is protected by a sheath of wood on one side and an open wire work guard on the other. At the end of this scabbard is often fixed part of the tail of a Chinaman, or other enemy, who has fallen a victim in some border war or on some head-hunting expedition. The lalao is a most necessary article to possess, for with it they cut their way through the jungle and thick undergrowth, with it they give the death-blow to the game they hunt; they use it in dividing the animals they kill, they eat with it as sailors do with their knives, they cut and split firewood with it, and last of all they cut off the heads of their enemies with this most useful implement. The blades are made by Chinese and are obtained by the savages in barter for deer's horns, &c.; often they are taken from the bodies of Chinese killed by them.\nin their numerous encounters with their would-be exterminators.\n\nOn occasions the men sometimes wear tied over their right shoulder and flowing down the back and across the chest, a square piece of variegated cloth (worn by women as a sort of petticoat, tied round the waist and reaching to the knees), but this article of apparel is worn more by the women than the men.\n\nThey wear another kind of coat, or rather jacket, called the fighting jacket. It is made in every way like the lukus, but in its size. Instead of extending low down the body, it only reaches as far as the waist, and is more like a shell jacket without sleeves than anything else. It is made of hemp, very closely interwoven with threads of scarlet long-ells, a colour which, amongst the northern tribes, seems to be the favourite. Further south, towards the Sylvian Range, coats embroidered with blue thread of long-ells are more the fashion. The long-ells and camlets used by the border savages are obtained from their neighbours, the Chinese hillmen. In describing the dress of the savages, I am alluding at present more especially to that worn by men living in the hills to the North of N. Lat. 24, and to the East of 121 E. Long. There appears to be very little variety in the costumes worn in this region, that is, in the lower ranges of hills, but at 6,000 to 8,000 feet above the sea level, great differences in the appearance of the dresses as well as in the manners and ways of the people are observable. A rather curious apology for a great coat is worn in damp or rainy weather, of which they get a very full share at all times of the year, for the lofty mountain ranges, varying from 4,000 to 12,000 feet running nearly the whole length of the island, offer a great attraction to rain clouds.\n\nThis coat is made generally of the skin of the large brown deer, only partially cured by exposure to the sun and wind. The design is about as rude as anything can be, a slit of about six inches in length is made in the hide and at the end of the slit a circular piece of the skin is cut out, allowing just room for the neck. The stiffness of the hide and the narrow space\nallowed for the neck prevent the coat dropping off the shoulders. A man with a covering of this kind can screw himself into such a position that no part of his body is exposed, excepting his head, and on this he places his jockey-cap-shaped rattan cap, with the peak at the back, thus securing perfect protection from rain. A few other articles besides those named are carried, such as hand nets, fishing gear, rope port-fires (made of hemp or the bark of a tree), worn round the wrists of men armed with matchlocks, &c., but such articles will be referred to later on.\n\n(To be continued.)\n\nJ.

The alleged necessity for this is thus stated by a writer in Excursions et Reconnaissances, VIII, 206 (November and December, 1885):\n\n\"It was necessary that France, the protecting power, should at last intervene. Without wishing to interfere unreasonably in the administration of the country, it was necessary that the revenue realised by the land-tax, ceasing to be devoted to the augmentation of the personal wealth of the King or privileged mandarins, should be the source of productive expenditure; it was necessary that the peasant should become owner of his land, and the slave master of his person; that justice should be regularly administered, and that, placed at first within the reach of all by the creation of minor courts, it should be secured by the existence of superior tribunals. It was necessary beyond everything that the execution of these reforms should not be evaded, as so many promises have been during the last twenty years, by the ill-will of mandarins.\"\n\n* The Law and Customs of the Malays with reference to the Tenure of Land, Journal, Straits Branch, Royal Asiatic Society, No. 13, p. 75.\n\u2020 p.p. 100 and 130.\ninterested in maintaining the existing state of affairs.\"\n\n\"The perusal of the decrees which follow will shew better than any commentary how it has been decided to solve all these difficulties.

The eight provinces formed out of the fifty-seven old ones are placed severally under the superintendence of a French Resident; a civil list is assigned to the King, while the headmen of provinces and the judges receive salaries which justify the exaction from them of integrity and industry. Finally, at the Court of the King, France is represented by a Resident-General who, instead of being, as in the past, an almost powerless spectator of Cambodian decline, will have a firm hand over all branches of the administration.\"\n\nThe decrees here alluded to include one relating to the political and administrative organisation of Cambodia, one providing for the judicial organisation, one abolishing slavery, one creating private property in land, and one abolishing tax in kind levied on paddy. All of these are of interest to Englishmen, to whom no experiment in colonisation and in the government of subject races can be a matter of indifference. But only the two last, as bearing upon land-tenures and land-revenue, and therefore related to the subject of the paper already mentioned, are here translated. Whether the political condition of the country will admit of their peaceful introduction remains yet to be seen.*\n\nW. E. MAXWELL.\n\n* \"The last mail from Indo-China brings also some particulars as to the situation in Cambodia. This country is far from being pacified; if it is true that our soldiers have been victorious in all engagements and that they have inflicted enormous losses on the insurgents, it is none the less true that the whole country is disorganised, that anarchy reigns there, and that security is wanting. What is most painful to us to notice is that these tidings only reach us through the post, that in the seven months during which the insurrection has now lasted the Governor of Cochin-China has given no details, except when they have been forced from him, and that it is only now that we are beginning to learn the names of the killed and wounded. Undoubtedly it was necessary not to give the movement more importance than it deserved, but it is, to say the least of it, strange that we should not have been informed, until a month after the event, that Pnom-Penh, the capital of Cambodia, had been attacked!\"\u2014Annales de l'Extr\u00eame Orient, July, 1885, p. 27.\nORDER RELATIVE TO THE CREATION OF PROPRIETORSHIP IN LAND IN CAMBODIA.\n\nPart I.\u2014Of the creation of property in land.\nPart II.\u2014Division of the State-domain.\nPart III.\u2014Of the administration of the State-domain.\nPart IV.\u2014Of occupiers.\nPart V.\u2014Of alienation.\nPart VI.\u2014Of registration of proprietorship.\nPart VII.\u2014Of dispossession.\n\nGeneral provisions.\n\nPart I.\n\nOf the Creation of Property in Land.\n\n1. The territory of Cambodia, up to this day the exclusive property of the Crown, is declared to be the property of the State.\n\n2. All persons holding lands by virtue of documents indicating a temporary hiring or alienation will be required to deposit the same, during the six months next following after the publication of this order, in the hands of the Resident of the Province, who will grant receipts for them.\n\nAfter having been verified by the Resident-General, these documents will, if their validity is established, be countersigned and returned to the parties interested.\n\n3. In default of compliance, within the period specified, with the requirements of the preceding section, land-holders will forfeit all rights.\n\nPart II.\n\nDivision of the State-domain.\n\n4. The State-domain includes,\nlands assigned as an endowment to the Crown;\nlands employed for public purposes (le domaine public);\nreserved lands (le domaine de r\u00e9serve);\nalienable lands (le domaine alienable).\n\nIn the endowment of the Crown is included all the immoveable property placed at the disposal of His Majesty the King of Cambodia, with power to him to collect the revenues thereof and to dispose of them at his pleasure, subject to the reservations contained in this order.\n\nIn the public domain are included\u2014roads, highways, railway lines and their appurtenances; streams navigable for vessels or rafts, as well as their banks or shores to a breadth of eight m\u00e8tres beyond the ordinary level of high water; all the ways of communication in general; buildings, lands and premises appropriated to a public purpose.\n\n5. The Crown endowment and the public domain are inalienable; the immoveable property composing them can neither be pledged or mortgaged.\n\n6. The reserved tracts include such immoveable property as the government decides to withhold from immediate alienation and to reserve for the wants of the future, although they form a portion neither of the Crown endowment nor of the public domain.\n\nSuch immoveable property is inalienable as long as it continue to be classed under this category; it may, however, be pledged or mortgaged.\n\n7. The alienable tracts comprise all lands, the alienation of which is authorised as occasion arises. They may be classified, in each commune, in different classes, which will only be disposed of successively, so that lands of the second class will only be alienated after those of the first have been exhausted, those of the third class after the complete alienation of the second, and so on.\n\n8. Land revenue of all kinds, and the rents derived from the immoveable property of the State-domain, with the exception of the Crown endowment, go to the credit of the State budget, which benefits similarly by the sums realised by the sale of alienable lands.\n9. The classification of the lands of the State-domain into\u2014\n\nthe Crown endowment,\nthe public domain,\nthe reserved portion, and\nthe alienable portion,\n\nwill be carried out, and may be modified from time to time by an order of the Resident-General, confirmed by the Governor of Cochin-China, after consultation with the Council of the Government of Cambodia.\n\nThe division, according to communes, and the classification of the alienable tracts will be effected by the provincial Residents, after consultation with the native authorities, and sanctioned by the Resident-General.\n\nPart III.\n\nOf the Administration of the State-domain.\n\n10. The State-domain is administered, under the high authority of the King and of the Governor of Cochin-China, by the French Resident-General, represented in the provinces by the Residents.\n\nThe Resident-General executes, either in person or by those to whom he has delegated authority, all the instruments which affect the State-domain; purchases, sales, concessions, contracts, exchanges, leases and agreements, and represents it in Courts of law.\n\nPart IV.\n\nOf Occupiers.\n\n11. Exceptional advantages will be offered to occupiers of the soil.\n\nThose who have established themselves upon lands forming part of the alienable domain will be admitted, in preference to all other persons, either to become the owners of such lands on a gratuitous title, or else to acquire them by private contracts in consideration of a payment calculated on the\nintrinsic value of the soil independent of any added value resulting from improvements made by such occupiers.\n\n12. Those who have established themselves on lands appropriated to the public domain or the reserved tracts will have to quit them within a period to be fixed by the Resident of the province; but they will receive, free of cost, if they desire it, a concession of land sufficient to indemnify them for any losses resulting from compulsory removal.\n\nWhen the lands in respect of which such evacuation is to be effected are occupied by standing crops, the period aforesaid can only commence from the day of their removal.\n\n13. Every person who shall occupy in the future, without the license of a competent authority, a piece of land belonging to the State, shall be liable to a fine of four times the letable value of the land occupied.\n\nPart V.\n\nOf Alienation.\n\n14. The land of the State may be alienated by means of free gift (concession gratuite), of sale by private contract, and of sale by public auction.\n\n15. Free concession of fifty hectares* and under, in the country, or of one thousand square metres and under in centres of population, may be granted by the provincial Residents, after consultation with the native authorities; but they will not take effect until after approval by the Resident-General.\n\n16. Concessions of greater extent may be made by the Resident-General. When they exceed three hundred hectares, in the case of country lands, or three thousand square metres in the case of populous centres, they must, in addition, be ratified by the Governor of Cochin-China, after consultation with the Council of the Government of Cambodia.\n\n17. Sales by private contract of land of a value of two hundred dollars and under may be concluded by the provincial Residents and confirmed by the Resident-General; above two hundred dollars, they may be concluded by the Resident-\n\n* One hectare = two acres one rood thirty-five perches.\nGeneral; when they exceed two thousand dollars, they must, in addition, be submitted for the approval of the Governor of Cochin-China, the Council of the Government of Cambodia being consulted.\n\n18. The putting up of land for sale by public auction must, in every case, be authorised, as a preliminary measure, by the Resident-General, who has subsequently to confirm the report of the sale. This report must, in addition, receive the approval of the Governor of Cochin-China, in consultation with the Council of Government of Cambodia, if the price realised at the auction exceeds two thousand dollars.\n\n19. In case the confirmation of the Resident-General, or the approval of the Governor, is refused, the alienations mentioned in sections 16, 17 and 18 will be rendered void and will be of no effect.\n\n20. The draft of the instrument of free concession or of private contract is shewn on the counterfoil of the register of alienations kept at the Residency of the Province in which the land is situated: a duplicate is made out on the detachable part of the same register and an extract thereof upon the butt attached to the latter. These three documents are signed by the provincial Resident and by the purchaser or concessionaire, or by two witnesses if the latter be illiterate. The detachable copy and its butt are then torn off and despatched to the Resident-General, who will transmit them, if necessary, to the Governor.\n\nAfter all the prescribed formalities have been performed, the butt is detached from the duplicate and kept at the Chief Residency (la R\u00e9sidence G\u00e9n\u00e9rale) while this latter is made over to the party interested to serve as his document of title.\n\n21. The approval of the Governor of Cochin-China may be given in a general way, by a resolution mentioning the various instruments, to several alienations.\n\n22. Sections 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 (the three first paragraphs only), 16, 17, 18 and 19 of the resolution of the 22nd August, 1882, relating to the alienations of public land in Cochin-China, shall be applicable to sales by auction of public lands in Cambodia. The Resident-General is to perform the functions which in Cochin-China devolve on the Director of the Interior.\n23. The instrument of alienation may contain a stipulation exempting the land from taxation, either wholly or partially, for a period which shall in no case exceed four years.\n\nThe purchase money will be payable either in cash at the time of delivery of title, or by annual payments calculated in such a manner that the purchaser will find himself entirely free within a maximum period of ten years.\n\n24. The cost of taking possession must be defrayed entirely by the purchasers and concessionaires.\n\n25. Instruments by which the alienation of State lands is effected are exempt from all fees for registration or otherwise, with the exception of a fixed charge of 20 cents for delivery of title, which will be levied at the time of registration in the register of alienations, on which a minute of sales by auction will be entered.\n\n26. The alienation of State lands takes final effect\u2014in the case of free concessions, by the discharge, for four consecutive years, of the land-tax; or, in the case of alienations burdened with a payment, by the entire payment of the purchase-money.\n\n27. The Resident-General can always direct the revocation of alienations which have not taken final effect, either for non-compliance with the clauses of the contract, or for insufficient or bad cultivation.\n\nThe eviction of the purchaser or concessionaire is pronounced, after a preliminary suit, by the authority who ordered the alienation, subject to the confirmation or approval of the superior authorities whose concurrence is necessary as laid down in sections 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19.\n\n28. No demise of State lands for farming can take place if it has not been previously authorised by the Resident-General; such demise will then be concluded by the provincial Resident, entered on the register of leases specially kept for that purpose (which will be kept in the way indicated in section 20 as to the register of alienation), and confirmed by the Resident-General in the same way as sales by private contract where the purchase money is less than two hundred dollars, before the detached duplicate is issued to the lessee. This latter can in no case be exempted from payment of the land-tax.\n29. Leases of land belonging to the State will be chargeable with a fee of twenty cents on delivery of title. This fee will be levied at the time of the entry on the register of leases.\n\n30. Christian institutions, pagodas, mosques and other religious establishments, will be permitted to keep in full property the lands occupied by them on the 17th June, 1884, the day of the signature of the Pnom-Penh Convention, that is to say, temple-grounds, cemeteries, schools, and priests' houses, with their gardens and out-houses.\n\nPART VI.\n\nOf Registration of Lands.\n\n31. During the six months next following after the publication of this order, there will be opened, for each commune, or, if necessary, for each section of a commune, quarter, or hamlet, a register of the lands comprised in it, the form of which will be decided upon hereafter.\n\nThese registers will be kept in French by the provincial Residents.\n\n32. All mutations of immoveable property must, under pain of nullity, be certified to the headmen of cantons, who will receive the instrument by virtue of which the mutation is effected, will give a receipt for it, and will forward it without delay, through the successive grades of headmen (par la voie hi\u00e9rarchique), to the provincial Resident for entry on the register of lands of his Residency.\n\nThe certificate of the parties interested is verified by a statement signed by the Resident and written upon the instrument of transfer.\n\nNo mutation of title can be effected by a verbal contract.\n\n33. The registers of lands will be commenced afresh every five years.\n\nPART VII.\n\nOf Dispossession.\n\n34. No one shall henceforth be obliged to surrender his\nproperty except in the case of its being required for public purposes, and in consideration of fair compensation previously paid.\n\n35. Lands in respect of which dispossession is effected on account of their being required for public purposes, will become part of the State-domain and be classified under the head of le domaine public.\n\n36. Whenever there shall be occasion for dispossession, the nature of the public purposes for which the land is required shall be previously declared by an order of the Resident-General. This order will describe the lands to be appropriated, will declare their appropriation, will state, if necessary, any reasons for urgency in fixing the date from which possession will be taken, and will appoint the non-official members of the Committee mentioned in the following section.\n\n37. Within (at the latest) the three months next following the order of the Resident-General, a Committee consisting of\u2014\n\n1. the Provincial Resident, or his deputy, President;\n2. the Headman of the arrondissement and the Headman of the canton, within which the land appropriated is situated;\n3. the two non-official members appointed by the order prescribed in s. 36;\n\nshall proceed to the spot, inspect the land appropriated, listen to the claims of the owners and other persons interested (notice having been given to them at least eight days previously) and fix the amount of the compensation.\n\nThe Committee will draw up a Report of its proceedings and forward it without delay to the Resident-General, who will pay, within three months from the date of such report, the sums thereby awarded.\n\n38. Except in cases of urgency, possession shall never be taken until the compensation has been paid.\n\nThe taking of possession must never be delayed longer than the month following such payment.\n\nIf urgency has been formally declared to exist, possession will be taken on the date fixed in the order of the Resident-General.\nIn either case, the fact of possession having been taken must be recorded in a report by the Provincial Resident.\n\n39. Every act of dispossession which shall not be in conformity with the preceding regulations is hereby declared to be void and of no effect, provided that this shall in no way affect any liability, civil or criminal, which may have been incurred by those officers who may have ordered, prosecuted, carried out, or in any manner taken part in the same.\n\nGeneral Procedure.\n\n40. Any matter not provided for in the present Regulation shall, on the motion of the Resident-General, be determined by the Governor of Cochin-China, the Council of the Government of Cambodia being consulted.\n\n41. The Resident-General is charged with the carrying out of the present order, which shall be enrolled wherever needful, and inserted in the Journal Officiel de la Cochin-Chine Francaise and in the Bulletin Officiel du Cambodge.\n\nGiven at Pnom-Penh, the 28th October, 1884.\n\nCHARLES THOMSON,\nGovernor of Cochin-China.\n\n(Seal of the first Minister).\n\nOrder abolishing the Tax on Paddy.\n\n1. The tax upon paddy levied by the Oknhaluong is, and shall remain, abolished.\n2. The foregoing decision shall apply to the harvest, now in progress, for 1884.\n3. Paddy intended for the manufacture of spirits shall continue to be charged with a duty of ten per cent.\n4. The representative, for the time being, of the Protectorate is charged with the enforcement of this decree.\n\nGiven at Pnom-Penh, the 18th November, 1884.\n\nCHARLES THOMSON,\nGovernor.\n\n(Seal of the first Minister).\n\nBy order of the Governor,\n\nJ. FOURES,\nRepresentative (provisional) of the Protectorate.\nMALAY LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE.\n\nThe Malay language is a member of the Malayan section of the Malayo-Polynesian class of languages, but it is by no means a representative type of the section which has taken its name from it. The area over which it is spoken comprises the peninsula of Malacca with the adjacent islands (the Rho-Lingga Archipelago), the greater part of the coast districts of Sumatra and Borneo, the seaports of Java, the Sunda and Banda Islands. It is the general medium of communication throughout the archipelago from Sumatra to the Philippine Islands, and it was so upwards of three hundred and fifty years ago when the Portuguese first appeared in those parts.\n\nThere are no Malay manuscripts extant, no monumental records with inscriptions in Malay, dating from before the spreading of Islam in the archipelago, about the end of the 13th century. By some it has been argued from this fact that the Malays possessed no kind of writing prior to the introduction of the Arabic alphabet (W. Robinson, J. J. de Hollander); whereas others have maintained, with greater show of probability, that the Malays were in possession of an ancient alphabet, and that it was the same as the Rechang (Marsden, Friederich), as the Kawi (Van der Tuuk), or most like the Lampong (Kern),\u2014all of which alphabets, with the Battak, Bugi, and Macassar, are ultimately traceable to the ancient Cambodian characters. With the Mohammedan conquest the Perso-Arabic alphabet was introduced among the Malays; it has continued ever since to be in use for literary, religious, and business purposes. Where Javanese is the principal language, Malay is sometimes found written with Javanese characters; and in Palembang, in the Minangkabo country of Middle Sumatra, the Rechang or Renchong characters are in general use, so called from the sharp and pointed knife with which they are cut on the smooth side of bamboo staves. It is only since the Dutch have established their supremacy in the archipelago that he\nRoman character has come to be largely used in writing and printing Malay. This is also the case in the Straits Settlements.*\n\nBy the simplicity of its phonetic elements, the regularity of its grammatical structure, and the copiousness of its nautical vocabulary, the Malay language is singularly well-fitted to be the lingua franca throughout the Indian archipelago. It possesses the five vowels, a, i, u, e, o, both short and long, and one pure diphthong au. Its consonants are k, g, ng, ch, j, y, t, d, n, p, b, m, y, r, l, w, s, h. Long vowels can only occur in open syllables. The only possible consonantal nexus in purely Malay words is that of a nasal and mute, a liquid and mute and vice versa, and a liquid and nasal. Final k and h are all but suppressed in the utterance. Purely Arabic letters are only used in Arabic words, a great number of which have been received into the Malay vocabulary. But the Arabic character is even less suited to Malay than to the other Eastern languages on which it has been foisted. As the short vowels are not marked, one would, in seeing, e.g., the word bintang, think first of bintang, a star; but the word might also mean a large scar, to throw down, to spread, rigid, mutilated, enceinte, a kind of cucumber, a redoubt, according as it is pronounced bantang, banting, bentang, buntang, buntung, bunting, benteng.\n\nMalay is essentially, with few exceptions, a dissyllabic language, and the syllabic accent rests on the penultimate unless that syllable is open and short; e.g., datang, nam\u00e1na, b\u00e9-s\u00e1r, diumpatkan\u00fal\u00e1h. Nothing in the form of a root word indicates the grammatical category to which it belongs; thus, k\u00e1sih, kindness, affectionate, to love; ganti, a proxy, to exchange, instead of. It is only in derivative words that this vagueness is avoided. Derivation is effected by infixes, prefixes, affixes, and reduplication. Infixes occur more rarely in Malay than in the cognate tongues. Examples are\u2014guruh, a rumbling noise, gumuruh, to make such a noise; tunjuk, to point, telunjuk, the forefinger; chuchuk, to pierce, cheruchuk,\n\n* No. The Roman character has not yet been adopted in the Straits Settlements, either in the Government Vernacular Schools, or by the Native Press.\n\nEd.\na stockade. The import of the prefixes\u2014m\u0113 (m\u0113ng, m\u0113n, m\u0113n, m\u0113m), p\u0113 (p\u0113ng, p\u0113n, p\u0113n, p\u0113m), b\u0113r, (b\u0113l), p\u0113r, p\u0113l, ka, di, t\u0113r,\u2014and affixes\u2014an, kan, i, lah\u2014will best appear from the following examples: root word \u0101jar, to teach, to learn; meng\u0101jar, to instruct (expresses an action); b\u0113l\u0101jar, to study (state or condition); meng\u0101jari, to instruct (some one, trans.); meng\u0101jarkan, to instruct (in something, causative); peng\u0101jaran, the instructor; p\u0113l\u0101jar, the learner; peng\u0101jaran, the lesson taught, also the school; pel\u016bj\u0101ran, the lesson learnt; di\u0101jar, to be learnt t\u0113raj\u0101r, learnt; t\u0113raj\u0101rkan, taught; t\u0113raj\u0101ri, instructed; [p\u0113r\u0101ja; (from r\u0101ja, prince), to recognize as prince; p\u0113raj\u0101kan, to crown as prince; karaj\u0101an, royalty]; ajarkanlah, teach! Examples of reduplication are\u2014\u0101jar-\u0101jar, a sainted person; \u0101jar-b\u0113r\u0101jar, (or b\u0113l\u0101jar), to be learning and teaching by turns; similarly there are forms like \u0101jar-m\u0113ng\u0101jar, b\u0113r\u0101jar-aj\u0101ran, \u0101jar-aj\u0101ri, m\u0113mp\u0113r\u0101jar, m\u0113mp\u0113r\u0101jarkan, m\u0113mp\u0113r\u0101j\u0101ri, t\u0113-h\u0113l\u0101jarkan, p\u0113rb\u0113l\u0101jarkan, &c. Altogether there are upwards of a hundred possible derivative forms, in the idiomatic use of which the Malays exhibit much skill. See especially H. von De- wall, De vormveranderingen der Maleische taal, Batavia, 1864; and J. Pijnappel, Maleisch-Hollandsch Woordenboek, Amsterdam, 1875, \u201cInleiding.\u201d In every other respect the language is characterized by great simplicity and indefiniteness. There is no inflexion to distinguish number, gender, or case. Number is never indicated when the sense is obvious or can be gathered from the context; otherwise plurality is expressed by adjectives such as sug\u0101la, all, and b\u0101huk, many, more rarely by the repetition of the noun, and the indefinite singular by sa or s\u0101tu, one, with a class-word. Gender may, if necessary, be distinguished by the words laki-laki, male, and p\u0113ramp\u016ban, female, in the case of persons, and of jantun and b\u0113lina in the case of animals. The genitive case is generally indicated by the position of the word after its governing noun. Also adjectives and demonstrative pronouns have their places after the noun. Comparison is effected by the use of particles. Instead of the personal pronouns, both in their full and abbreviated forms, conventional nouns are in frequent use to indicate the social position or relation of the respective interlocutors, as, e.g., hamba tuan, the master\u2019s slave, i.e., I. These nouns vary according to the different localities. Another peculiarity of\nMalay (and likewise of Chinese, Shan, Talaing, Burmese, and Siamese) is the use of certain class-words or coefficients with numerals, such as orang (man), when speaking of persons, ekor (tail) of animals, keping (piece) of flat things, biji (seed) of roundish things; e.g., lima biji telor, five eggs. The number of these class-words is considerable. Malay verbs have neither person nor number nor mood or tense. The last two are sometimes indicated by particles or auxiliary verbs; but these are generally dispensed with if the meaning is sufficiently plain without them. The Malays avoid the building up of long sentences. The two main rules by which the order of the words in a sentence is regulated are\u2014subject, verb, object; and qualifying words follow those which they qualify. This is quite the reverse of what is the rule in Burmese.\n\nThe history of the Malays supply accounts for the number and variety of foreign ingredients in their language. Hindus appear to have settled in Sumatra and Java as early as the 4th century of our era, and to have continued to exercise sway over the native populations for many centuries. These received from them into their language a very large number of Sanskrit terms from which we can infer the nature of the civilizing influence imparted by the Hindu rulers. Not only in words concerning commerce and agriculture, but also in terms connected with social, religious, and administrative matters, that influence is traceable in Malay. See W. E. Maxwell, Manual of the Malay Language, 1882, pp. 5\u201334, where this subject is treated more fully than by previous writers. This Sanskrit element forms such an integral part of the Malay vocabulary that in spite of the subsequent infusion of Arabic and Persian words adopted in the usual course of Mohammedan conquest it has retained its ancient citizenship in the language. The number of Portuguese, English, Dutch, and Chinese words in Malay is not considerable; their presence is easily accounted for by political or commercial contact.\n\nThe Malay language abounds in idiomatic expressions, which constitute the chief difficulty in its acquisition. It is sparing in the use of personal pronouns, and prefers impersonal and elliptical diction. As it is rich in specific expressions for the various aspects of certain ideas, it is requisite to employ always the most appropriate term suited to the particular\naspect. In Maxwell's Manual, pp. 120 sq., no less than sixteen terms are given to express the different kinds of striking, as many for the different kinds of speaking, eighteen for the various modes of carrying, &c. An unnecessary distinction has been made between High Malay and Low Malay. The latter is no separate dialect at all, but a mere brogue or jargon, the medium of intercourse between illiterate natives and Europeans too indolent to apply themselves to the acquisition of the language of the people; its vocabulary is made up of Malay words, with a conventional admixture of words from other languages; and it varies, not only in different localities, but also in proportion to the individual speaker's acquaintance with Malay proper. The use is different as regards the term Jawi as applied to the Malay language. This has its origin in the names Great Java and Lesser Java, by which the mediaval Java and Sumatra were called, and it accordingly means the language spoken along the coasts of the two great islands.\n\nMalay is probably spoken with greatest purity in the Rhio-Lingga Archipelago and in the independent states of Perak and Kedah, on the western coast of the peninsula of Malacca. In other states of the peninsula (Johor, Tringganu, Kelantan) dialectical divergencies both as to pronunciation and the use of words have been noted. The most important and the most interesting of all the Malay dialects is that of Menangkabo (Menangkanbau) in the residency of Padang and in Upper Jambi, in Central Sumatra. It abounds in diphthongs, and prefers vocalic to consonantal terminations, thus changing final al and ar into a', il and ir into iye, ul and ur into uwe, as' and at into e', us into uri; final a mostly passes into \u00f2, so that for sud\u00e0ra and sud\u00e0yar they say sud\u00e8r\u00f2, sud\u00e8go; the emphatic -lah is turned into -malah or maluh h\u00e1: the prefixes b\u00e9r, p\u00e9r, t\u00e9r are changed into b\u00e1, p\u00e1, t\u00e0, or b\u00e1r\u00e1, p\u00e1r\u00e1, t\u00e1r\u00e1. Among other changes in pronunciation may be noted \u00farang for orang, mungko for maka, lai for l\u00e1g\u00ec; they use nan for yung, na' for hendak, deh for oleh, ba' for b\u00e1gai, pai for pergi, ko' for jikalau, &c. In some districts of Menangkabo (Palembang, Lebong) the Renchong character is in general use in writing this dialect, for which purpose it is far better suited than the Arabic. As early as 1822 a small tract on the customs and traditions\nof Moko-Moko, in this dialect, was printed with a translation at Bencoolen. But it is only in recent years that the Dutch have commenced to pay the dialect the attention it deserves, by publishing texts, with transliteration and translations and supplying other materials for its investigation. See the Transactions and Journal of the Asiatic Societies of Batavia and the Hague the Indische Gids, and more especially the philological portion, by A. L. van Hasselt, of Midden-Sumatra, iii. 1 (Leyden, 1883), where also the best and fullest account of the Renchong character is to be found. Of other Malay dialects in Sumatra, only the one spoken at Achih (Achin) deserves mention: in Java the Batavian dialect shows the most marked peculiarities. The numerous and greatly divergent dialects spoken in the Molucca Islands (valuable information on which has been supplied by F. S. A. de Clercq, G. W. W., C. van Hoevell, and A. van Eekris) and in Timor differ so materially from the Malay of the peninsula of the Menangkabo that they cannot be called Malay dialects at all; whereas the Malay spoken in some parts of the Minahassa (Celebes) scarcely differs from Malay proper.\n\nThere is no grammar of Malay by a native writer with the sole exception of a small tract of 70 pages, entitled Bustanu 'Ikh\u0101tib\u012bn, by R\u0101ja Ali Hajji of Rhio, which was lithographed in the island of Peiengal in 1857. A. Pigafetta, who accompanied Magellan in his first voyage round the globe, was the first European whose vocabulary of Malay words (450) has come down to us. Next in the field were the Dutch, who provided a medium of intercourse between their traders and the Malays. F. Houtman's Vocabulary and Conversations, in Dutch, Malay, and Malagasy, appeared at Amsterdam in 1603; and it may be noted that the Malay spoken in those days does not appear to have materially altered since. The same dialogues appeared in English and Malay in 1614. Since then numerous grammars, dictionaries, and conversation books have been brought out by English and Dutch writers. As the best helps at present available for the study of Malay may be recommended W. E. Maxwell's Manual of the Malay Language, London, 1882 (especially valuable for its full treatment of the idioms); P. Favre, Grammaire de la langue Malaise, Vienna and Paris, 1876; and Dictionnaire Malais-Fran\u00e7ais, ib., 1875,\n2 vols.; Dictionnaire Francais-Malais, ib., 1880, 2 vols.; J. J. de Hollander, Handleiding bij de beoefening der Maleische taal en letterkunde, Breda, 1892; J. Pijnappel, Maleische Spraak-kunst, Hague, 1866; and Maleisch-Hollandsch Woordenboek, Amsterdam, 1875. The printing of Von Dewall's Dictionary, edited by H. N. van der Tuuk, is still in progress at Batavia.\n\nLiterature.\u2014There are two kinds of Malay popular literature\u2014the one in prose, the other in poetry. The former comprises the proverbs, the latter the \"pantuns.\" Agriculture, hunting, fishing, boating, and wood-craft are the occupations or accomplishments which furnish most of the illustrations, and the number of beasts, birds, fishes, and plants named in a collection of Malay proverbs will be found to be considerable\" (W. E. Maxwell, Malay Proverbs). H. C. Klinkert, published a collection in the Bijdragen tot de taalkunde van N. I. (Journal of the Asiatic Society of the Hague) for 1866, pp. 39-87. See also J. Habema on the Menangkabo proverbs, in vols. xxv. and xxvi. of the Batavian Tijdschrift, and Favre's Dictionnaire Malais-Fran\u00e7ais, passim. The pantuns are improvised poems, generally (though not necessarily) of four lines, in which the first and third and the second and fourth rhyme. They are mostly love poems; and their chief peculiarity is that the meaning intended to be conveyed is expressed in the second couplet, whereas the first contains a simile or distant allusion to the second, or often has, beyond the rhyme, no connexion with the second at all. The Malays are fond of reciting such rhymes \"in alternate contest for several hours, the preceding pantun furnishing the catchword to that which follows, until one of the parties be silenced or vanquished.\"\n\nSee T. J. Newbold, Account of the British Settlements in the Straits of Malacca, vol. ii. 346; Klinkert in the Bijdragen for 1868, pp. 309-70; L. K. Harmsen in the Tijdschrift, vol. xxi. pp. 480-533 (Menangkabo). If the Malays have kept entirely aloof from the influences of Islam in this the most characteristic part of their literature, they have almost equally preserved their independence in the other departments. Not that this may be considered entirely to their credit; for, if they had endeavoured to infuse into their writings some of the spirit of Arabic and Persian historiography, poetry, and fiction, it could not but have benefited the character of their own liter-\nary productions. As it is their histories and chronicles are a strange motley of truth and fiction; their poems and novels lack coherence and imagination, and are singularly monotonous and devoid of that spirit of chivalry which pervades the corresponding branches of literature among the leading nations of Islam. As Malay copyists are much given to making arbitrary changes, it happens that no two MSS. agree, and that of many a popular work different recensions exist, which, moreover, often go by different names. This circumstance greatly tends to increase the difficulties of editing Malay texts. Works on specially Mohammedan subjects (theology, law, ethics, mysticism) are of course only imitations of Arabic or Persian originals; there are also numerous novels and poems treating of purely Mohammedan legends. But not only is there traceable in many of these a slight undercurrent of Hinduism and even pre-Hinduism; the Malays possess also, and indiscriminately read along with their Mohammedan books, quite as many works of fiction of purely Hindu origin. The want, however, of political cohesion, and of a national spirit among tribes so scattered as the Malays are, which could have favoured the growth of a national epic or national songs, sufficiently accounts for the absence from their literature of any productions of this class, such as exist in Bugi and Macassar literature.\n\nThe most popular of their poetical productions are the *Sha'ir Ken Tamh\u0101k*, *Sha'ir Bid\u0101s\u0101ri*, *Sha'ir Jauhar M\u0101nikam* and *Sha'ir Abdu'lmut\u0101k*, all of which have been printed. Among the prose works there are various collections of local laws and customs (*undang-undang*), chronicles (such as the *Sajarat m\u0101l\u0101yu*), books on ethics (the best are the *Makota sag\u0101la raja-r\u0101ja*, and the *Bust\u0101nu'ssal\u0101tin*, and a very large number of works of fiction and legendary lore, some of which possess much descriptive power. They all bear the title *Hik\u0101yat*, and the following are the best-known: *H. Hang T\u016bah*, *H. Hamzah*, *H. Ism\u0101 Yatim*, *H. Junjumah*, *H. Bakhtiy\u0101r* (*S\u0101dah Bakhtin, Ghol\u0101m*), *H. Simiskin*, *H. Sult\u0101n Ibr\u0101h\u012bm*, *H. Sri R\u0101ma*, *H. Pand\u0101wa Lima*. Several of these and many other works not mentioned here have appeared in print (with or without translation) chiefly in Holland, Batavia, and Singapore, and extracts have been given in the various Malay chrestomathies by Dulaurier, De Hollander, Niemann, Van der Tuuk, Gra-\nshuis, and in Marsden's Malay Grammar. The best recent Malay writer was 'Abdullah ibn 'Abdelkadir Munshi of Singapore, who died, it is said of poison, at Mecca, some eight and twenty years ago. His autobiography, \"Journey to Kelantan,\" and \"Pilgrimage to Mecca\" are patterns of Malay style, though the author's contact with educated Europeans is traceable in them, while his translation (from the Tamil version) of the Panchatantra is free from such influence.\n\nMalay literature is fairly represented in England in the British Museum, the India Office, and the Royal Asiatic Society, and descriptive catalogues of the Malay MSS. in each of these libraries are available. See Niemann in the Bijdragen, iii. 6, p. 96-101; Van der Tuuk in Tijdschrift voor Ned. Indi\u00eb for 1849, i. p. 385-400, and in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, new series, ii. p. 85-135. An account of the Leyden collection, by J. Pijnappel, is given in the Bijdragen, iii. 5, pp. 142-178. The finest collection of Malay MSS., upwards of 400 volumes, is in the library of the Asiatic Society of Batavia. See L. W. C. van den Berg, Verslag van eene verzameling Maleische, &c., handschriften, Batavia, 1877. If it had not been for the loss, by fire, on their passage from India, of three hundred Malay MSS., the property of the late Sir T. S. Raffles, England would now boast of the largest assemblage of Malay MSS. in the world. On Malay literature in general, compare G. H. Werndly, Maleische Spraakkunst, Amsterdam, 1736, pp. 227-357; E. Jacquet in the Nouveau Journal Asiatique, vol. ix. (1832), pp. 97-132, and 222-253; T. J. Newbold, British Settlements in the Straits of Malacca, 1839, vol. ii. pp. 215-368; E.

R.\n\n[The foregoing paper, which is extracted from the Encyclopaedia Britannica (1883) is from the pen of Dr. Reinhold Rosr, the learned librarian of the India Office Library, a friend to Oriental research of every description.\n\nEd.]\nA MISSIONARY'S JOURNEY\nTHROUGH LAOS FROM BANGKOK TO \u00dbBON.\n\nAM glad to be able to communicate to the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society some notes made by a Missionary on his way from Bangkok to \u00dbbon to convert the Laos tribes.\n\nMissionaries penetrate gradually and from different directions into the midst of these savage tribes, and try to convert them to Christianity. The story of what occurred among the wild Ba-huars, an independent tribe on the West of Cochin-China near the 14\u00b0 lat. N. and 106\u00b0 long. E. (Paris), is well known. In the beginning of 1884 five Missionaries were murdered by brigands while they were engaged in establishing a Mission among the Chau tribe in the West of Tonquin.\n\nFor some time past the Mission in Siam has maintained a Station at \u00dbbon, near 15\u00b0 20' N. lat. and 109\u00b0 30' E. long. (Paris) on the Seimoun, a tributary of the Mekong. It is the Narrative of a Missionary on his way to \u00dbbon which I have now the pleasure of communicating.\n\nN. C.\n\nIt is not a carefully composed narrative that I propose to give you, but simply a journal kept from day to day, written often by the light of a torch, or of the setting sun, when, tired by the day's march, we had pitched our camp for the night. In order to take the place of P\u00e8re Rondel, invalided, I started with\nP\u00e8re Xavier Gu\u00e9go, who had already been for two years a Missionary in Laos. We bought in Bangkok such things as were absolutely necessary, these being of an exorbitant price among the Chinese of Laos, viz., cotton goods, thread, cooking utensils, medicines, etc. On Septuagesima Monday, the 11th of February, 1884, two boats loaded with luggage took their departure for Thakien, four days' journey N. E. of Bangkok. The following Thursday we were at Thakien, where the inhabitants entertained us during the few days employed in preparing the carts to be used on our journey. These carts were the same which had brought down our confr\u00e8res from Laos a few days before. On Wednesday, the 20th February, the carts started; we followed a few hours later, and overtook them, and halted at mid-day at the village of Ban-seng. This village is at the entrance of the forest, which we were not to leave again after this point. There is nothing but one immense forest, in some places very dense, in others relieved by clearings in the midst of which villages are scattered about. It is a thick wood, through which passes a road just broad enough for a cart, there is not room for a man either on the right or on the left. Here and there one comes across a clearing. It must not be supposed that the road is free from obstructions; now it is a deep rut which nobody fills up, now it is an enormous root which blocks up part of the road-way and which has to be crossed at the risk of seeing the cart smashed into a thousand pieces. We advanced in this way with our ten carts and relays of bullocks, which either followed or preceded us by a short distance. Sometimes a wheel would lose its spokes, and sometimes an axle would break (these axles are merely bars of some tough wood which go through the wheels and have to be renewed frequently).\n\nAt last, about 9 o'clock, we reached a muddy pool and pitched our camp on its banks. This consisted in arranging the carts in a large circle, in the centre of which the bullocks and horses were tethered to stakes driven into the ground. Their drivers spread their mats on the grass under the carts and passed the night there. As for ourselves, we had manufactured two little tents which we set up between two carts. Large fires, fed with fuel by watchmen who mounted\nguard armed with muskets, were a safeguard against wild beasts and robbers.\n\nThursday, 21st.\u2014Daylight had hardly appeared when I wakened the camp and rang to prayers. Then each made his way to the cart that served as our kitchen, to swallow a cup of tea, while waiting for breakfast, which might be a long time coming, for it was necessary first to reach the regular halting-place, otherwise no water was to be got. The bullocks were yoked, and we started\u2014my confr\u00e8re, on horseback, leading the way, while I brought up the rear in order to keep an eye upon stragglers. After an hour's march, there was a sudden halt, and I went from one cart to another asking what was the matter. Each had stopped because the one in front of it had stopped! It turned out that a wheel was broken, the damage was repaired with rattan, and we went on again. About midday we stopped near a pool and cooked our breakfast, while the bullocks, unyoked, cropped the fresh herbage. We were at the village of Ramachai; but we were in want of a spare felloe, for which we sought in vain. Our people went off to the Laosian village of Ban-kula and thence brought back the piece of wood that we wanted. We then set off. The route here was over loose, white sand, which made it very heavy travelling for the bullocks. In the evening we reached two muddy marshes; here, at the pool known as Nong-pi-ieng, we camped.\n\nFriday, 22nd.\u2014Towards the evening we arrived at a small village\u2014a group of little huts built upon piles in the middle of an enclosure formed of felled timber. We did not halt here, for the water was not good and the custom-house of Muang Sanam is only a kilom\u00e8tre further on and there is a good spring there.\n\nThe mention of a \"custom-house\" is calculated to make you suppose that we were approaching a collection of houses protected by a military station. But in this country a douane is a much more simple affair. No registers, no commissioners! Two men sprawling peacefully in a hut of leaves await, at the frontier of a province, the passage of cart and bullocks and levy a tax on the owners.\nSaturday, 23rd.\u2014A short stage. Busy preparing an altar.\n\nSunday, 24th.\u2014Mass. We camped in the evening on the banks of a torrent, which is nearly dry in this season.\n\nMonday, 25th.\u2014We found in the evening on the surface of the ground a kind of iron ore which the most intelligent of our followers called \"stone of Bien-hoa.\" This substance seems to me to be somewhat curious; it looks as if it were formed of little globules of iron, or like the slag which is taken from a furnace after smelting. Blocks of this stone are found at distant intervals, quite isolated one from the other. We camped near a little torrent.\n\nTuesday, 26th.\u2014We started again, crossing the stream Huai Khai, and met four bullock-carts accompanied by some Siamese. This is the first time for five days that we have come across any human being.\n\nWednesday, 27th.\u2014We had to cross the river Sak\u00e9o, which never dries up, and the bed of which is at the bottom of a deep ravine and is disfigured with stakes and snags.\n\nThe descent was negotiated, and we crossed over and halted for breakfast. Four or five Burmese caravans were encamped not far from us, and in another direction a party of Cambodians. These people had come from the provinces of Sourin and Sisaket to buy gambier, which they eat with the betel-leaf and areca-nut. They had been here for more than a week and had not yet been able to make their purchases, owing to their not having complied with some formality or other insisted on by the local authorities. While we took our meal, we received several visits. The first to come was a judge from the town of Amnet, twelve leagues from Ubon, who was on his way to Bangkok, and was good enough to take charge of a short note to Monseigneur Vey giving him news of us. By degrees all these folks disappeared on their way south, in the direction by which we had come. About 2 o'clock we too started. We had been on the march for about three quarters of an hour when we reached the custom-house of Sak\u00e9o, which is situated on the side of a road as large and straight as ours in Europe. It goes from the province of\nKabin to Battambang. Constructed originally by a Phya (high Siamese official) to secure easy communication with the Cambodian provinces subject to Siam, this road might be of the greatest use to travellers. But since the date of its construction it has not received any repairs whatever, and the forest therefore is taking possession of it again. In this very year (1884) a telegraph line has been erected along this road, over its entire length, by the agency of Frenchmen from Saigon (this line goes from Saigon to Bangkok). In the evening we camped at a pool called Nong Salika. A caravan of Chinese traders from Sourin had established themselves before our arrival, and among them was the nephew of an old Chinese Christian whom I had known at Bangkok. He was travelling towards Kabin to sell skins, silk, etc., and intended to bring back with him cloth, hardware, etc. His correspondent at Kabin being a Christian, I entrusted him with a second letter for Bangkok.\n\nThursday, 28th.\u2014At 3 p.m. we reached the frontier of the province of Vathana. We were all fasting, and we established ourselves in the sheds which had been built for the workmen employed on the telegraph line. Night had already fallen when we heard the sound of a band of men advancing in our direction. P\u00e8re Xavier got up to see what was happening, and saw a black mass a few feet in front of him. \"Who goes there?\" \"Phra Aphai.\" Torches were bought and P\u00e8re Xavier then saw that the black mass was an elephant of the largest size followed by two smaller ones. The travellers were in search of a lodging for the night, and as there still remained one large shed unoccupied, they settled themselves down in that.\n\nFriday, 29th.\u2014To-day we rested, and watched at our leisure the travellers of last night. Their chief is a Cambodian mandarin subordinate to Siam. Of the three elephants which he had with him, two were intended for the King of Siam as presents.\n\nThe mandarin came to pay us a visit, and informed us of the object of his journey. He is, he said, the son of Phya Anuphat (a high official) and the second mandarin of the Province\nof Siem-rab. In return for the elephants which he was going to offer to the King, he hoped for certain favours. We paid a visit to the Governor, for whom we had brought letters from Bangkok. His house is a tumble-down affair. He is of Laosian race, about sixty years old, and has under his government about two or three hundred houses scattered about in the forest, the population of which is Cambodian.\n\nSaturday, 1st March.\u2014For the last time we crossed the telegraph line, which we then quitted in order to take the road to Nong-bua (pool of Lokas). At one o'clock we resumed our journey, and camped in the evening at the village of Bang-sang inhabited by Laosians.\n\nSunday, 2nd.\u2014Our itinerary instructed us to go by Nong-phi, and Tong-nong\u2014two pools which are close to the roadside\u2014but the dryness of the weather obliged us to take another course, viz., by Ban-kin. Starting at half-past two, we travelled through forest, everything being most distressingly dry; at night we slept in the forest, the bullocks having to go without water. Our rice was cooked with the little which we had in reserve.\n\nMonday, 3rd.\u2014At ten o'clock we arrived at Ban-kin. Water good and abundant. At two o'clock the signal for departure was given, but two bullocks were missing and had to be recovered. We got away at last. Road bad. On the left a chain of mountains of considerable height was observable. At night we camped on the banks of a pool.\n\nTuesday, 4th.\u2014Excellent water in the morning, muddy water in the evening.\n\nWednesday, 5th.\u2014In the evening we arrived at the village of Huari-Sameron and pushed on to Kra-sa-m\u00e9mai, where we passed the night in the middle of a field.\n\nThursday, 6th.\u2014Early in the morning the headman of the village visited us at our camp, and brought us the provisions which we had asked for the night before on our arrival. These consisted of rice, fowls and red chillies. We were able also to procure here an additional cart for eleven ticals; this extra assistance was absolutely necessary, for we were ap-\napproaching a chain of mountains which we should have to cross in order to reach the plateau of Ubon. About half past four we emerged in an extensive clearing covered with reeds which were still green; we judged that we should here find the water we wanted so much, and we found accordingly a clear and abundant supply.\n\nFriday, 7th.\u2014We reached Puthai-saman at a tolerably early hour. Puthai-saman was formerly an important town, or perhaps rather an imposing temple erected to the worship of Buddha. It is one of those monuments of Cambodia which are so much renowned, and which astonish all travellers by their original and beautiful architecture. These monuments indicate the existence, among the people who conceived and carried them out, of a very advanced degree of civilization. We were tempted to inspect one of these precious specimens of the architecture of the Khmers, as savants would say.\n\nIt was not more than eight o'clock when we reached the east gate of the ruined city, which is flanked on its four sides by an enormous moat filled with water, the breadth of which is at least from thirty to forty metres. The sides of the moat are composed of enormous blocks of Bien-hoa stone and have a slope of about forty-five degrees. Everything was hidden from view by large trees, creepers, shrubs, and high grass which have taken possession of the locality. We camped outside the east gate. While breakfast was being got ready, I penetrated into the middle of the ruins. I shall not undertake to give a very exact description of them. This has already been done by the numerous learned travellers who have written about the ruins of Angkor-vat and Angkor-lom. The plan, the buildings, the details, are the same in all. Everything has been reproduced, down to the smallest piece of carving. These ruins differ one from another only in area. Puthai-saman seems to be Angkor-vat on a reduced scale.\n\nFollow me then step by step through the midst of colossal statues lying on the ground, stepping over a fragment of fallen wall, or a tree lying prostrate on the ruins. I reached the east gate by an immense causeway or bridge spanning the moat which I have just mentioned. On both sides, and an-\nlike those of Angkor-vat, a long dragon supported on the knees of a whole row of seated statues; these have the legs crossed and one of the hands under one thigh.\n\nAfter two hours spent in crossing these ruins, I endeavoured to make a plan of all that I had seen. This city or temple is built according to regular bearings, and forms a complete square.\n\nOn the four sides, each facing one of the cardinal points, enormous causeways thrown across a broad and deep moat gave access to the inner side of the outer wall. In front of these gateways, about three or four metres from the moat, and as if intended to protect the entrance, there were square enclosures, provided with a single door, above which rose a pile of cruciform buildings topped by pyramids.\n\nThe inner buildings, which it would be difficult to describe, were surrounded by a second ditch, less broad and deep than the first. There were four gates magnificently sculptured and defended, as it were, by monstrous figures with human bodies and hideous faces\u2014regular demons. The general mass of buildings was composed of galleries all connected one with another and crowned with domes at the points where they crossed; these domes were more and more lofty in proportion as they approached the centre, the middle one towering above all the others. The coping of all the walls, whether inner or outer, is formed of little sema (mounds) * in the middle of which is a Buddha seated. The large moat is kept abundantly supplied with water from two little streams.\n\nSaturday, 8th.\u2014It was with regret that we quitted these ruins. Who can tell us their story? What has become of those who built this city? Learned authorities are reduced to conjectures. The people of the country can furnish nothing but fabulous legends; according to them, these buildings are the work of the angels. After a troublesome journey through dense forest we camped on the banks of a muddy pool.\n\nSunday, 9th.\u2014After breakfast P\u00e8re Xavier went ahead to purchase provisions and to hire men and carts to enable us to\n\n* Sema, the sign by which a grave is known; a mound, a barrow.\nit is now nothing more than an enormous heap of ruins on which trees and creepers grow at pleasure. It was in the midst of these that I made these hasty notes. Several doors and windows, however, were to be seen, appearing out of the ruins. I sounded all the parts of these. Returning to the southern gate, I continued to follow the long wall of bas-reliefs. Here the direction in which the figures are walking changed. On the wall which terminates at the southern gate they were walking towards the East; now they were advancing towards the West. This southern gate\u2014I speak of the inner erection which must have been the palace, or a great temple raised in honour of Buddha\u2014furnishes access to four porticoes of colossal proportions, the roofs of all being composed of enormous blocks of stone shaped and placed one on the other. I continued to climb over the blocks lying about in all directions, and I reached a series of galleries in sufficiently good preservation to allow one to judge of the general plan. Here, as in almost all similar buildings of the races of Indo-China, the outside is generally finished while the inside, on the contrary, is hardly commenced. Is this intentional, or was the work abandoned before it was completed? Many savants are of the latter opinion. The gallery which I traversed is in the shape of a cross; it joins other galleries, the point of intersection being in all cases topped by a dome or a pyramid. In one of the doorways, there was still to be seen a frame of carved wood partly destroyed by white ants and exposure. In the opposite doorway, there is also a little fragment, but these were the only traces of wood I could find. In a small inner court near the doors and windows, there are statues of Siva let into the wall; the figure wears a diadem on its head, and holds a lotus in one hand, and a garland or snake in the other. The neck is ornamented with a phallus, and the feet with two rings. Beyond this court, a pyramid rises above a doorway; the stones are so put together as to form the features of a fabulous personage. This figure is repeated on all four sides. At the present time only one remains, all the others have fallen down.\n\nIn front of the south gate and spanning an inner moat, there is a large causeway, not so long as the one outside the main enclosure, which is bordered by fragments of a balustrade\nThursday, 13th.\u2014After crossing a ravine, we gained the plateau beyond. We were about to push on to the top, when a Cambodian caravan, consisting of thirty carts, on its way from Sourin to Battambang, came in sight on the only road. We passed the night on the road.\n\nFriday, 14th.\u2014After the morning's stage, we halted on the banks of a pool. Another Cambodian caravan, composed of twenty carts, passed close to us. This one came from Sourin and was bound for Nakhon Siemrab in Cambodia, on the banks of the Touli-sap (great lake) to buy fish.\n\nWe reached the plateau of Korat, all the chief difficulties being passed. About one o'clock we were able to camp for the night under the sheds prepared for the white elephant. In the evening another train of Cambodians passed, coming from Korat and going to buy fish at Siemrab.\n\nSaturday, 15th.\u2014After great difficulty in renewing our stores of provisions, we started and passed through the village of Ban Kham. The road passes through an open undulating country. The forest has been cleared over a great stretch of ground, and there is an extensive view. Towards the East, a hill was visible, which is probably a portion of the range which we had just left. The soil was now less dry, and we came across numerous springs, some of which were ferruginous. It was still broad daylight when we entered Ulok. We pitched our tent close to that place.\n\nSunday, 16th.\u2014A day of rest. Splendid pasture.\n\nMonday, 17th.\u2014We left the village of Ulok at dawn. Beautiful vegetation was on all sides of us. If the country were not so often harried by bands of ruffians, numerous villages might exist here comfortably. On our left, we passed one of many abandoned villages. Robbers had carried off everything, and had then set fire to it. We reached Ban-nai-mut and then Ban-khu, making the latter our halting-place.\n\nTuesday, 18th.\u2014We passed through the village of Bak-tran, halting at night at Ban-dai.\n\nWednesday, 19th.\u2014We skirted the village of Ban-kathum. The head-man, hearing of our approach, came to meet us in\norder to warn us to keep away. Small-pox was making great ravages in the village. Detained by a storm, we passed the night in an old pagoda of the village of Tamnon.\n\nThursday, 20th.\u2014There are still three or four more provinces through which we have to pass and then we shall reach the end of our journey. The first thing in the morning we set off in the direction of Muang Songl\u00e9, under a pelting shower of rain, and reached the shelter prepared for the white elephant, where we breakfasted. An hour's march brought us to Muang Songl\u00e9. As we left the forest, we could see the town on a slight eminence. The scene is a most charming one, the lofty stems of palms and betel-nut trees forming a perfect bouquet of verdure, while the houses are lost to view behind the leaves of bananas. We camped on the north side, occupying a building set apart for the use of travellers on the banks of a stream, whose waters fall into the Seimun, the river of Ubon.\n\nFriday, 21st.\u2014We reached the village of Ban Nong Mek. In this part of the country, numerous pines are intermingled with the forest trees. We camped at the village of Sameron.\n\nSaturday, 22nd.\u2014Our guide was to have taken us by Khantatarum, but he missed the way, and we went by Ban Huai and Pi Nai.\n\nSunday, 23rd.\u2014We were taken to the site of a village which had been plundered and abandoned. Here we established ourselves for a couple of days.\n\nMonday, 24th.\u2014Went out shooting green pigeons and peacocks.\n\nTuesday, 25th.\u2014We reached Khu Khane a little before midday. Once more the building erected for accommodation of the white elephant and his attendants served as our place of shelter. Two days before, according to the inhabitants, two Europeans had halted at the same place, but from what they said I concluded that these must have been Cambodian half-castes. They came to sell opium. We passed through the village of Ban Sami\u00e9 and at ten o'clock at night we reached Ban Xam Lom.\nWednesday, 26th.\u2014This plain is covered with numerous villages. We passed the night at Ban Pheng-puai.\n\nThursday, 27th.\u2014We breakfasted at the village of Ban Thum. At night we travelled by torch-light. When we were within half a kilom\u00e8tre of the village where we intended to sleep, a wheel of one of the carts gave away, a section of the tire and three spokes being broken. It was impossible to make the necessary repairs on the spot, so I left the cart and bullocks under the charge of three men and went on to the village with the other carts. There I had a wheel taken off one of the latter, to take the place of the broken one of the cart which had been left behind. During the night the broken wheel was repaired.\n\nFriday, 28th.\u2014We left the village of Ban Song Sang, where we had slept, with the intention of going as far as Ban Nong. We passed the huai (torrent) of Khajung by a large bridge built in the preceding year. The bridge was a good one, but the roadway, being formed of planks placed loosely on the cross-pieces, reminded one of the keys of a piano as the carts went over it. The road presented no difficulties, so, notwithstanding darkness, we pushed on by torchlight. At last, as our guides no longer knew the way, we camped where we were, for fear of going wrong. Our compass shewed us the blunder which the guides were making; our right course was N. E. and we were going N. W.\n\nSaturday, 29th.\u2014In the morning, after some search, we hit upon the right road, about six hundred metres to our left. The mistake was quickly rectified, and the country being level and free from underwood, we were able to make short cuts. We passed Ban Khin and then Ban Non Noi and Ban Non Jai and slept at Ban Kho, the last village before Ubon. We slept in the midst of carts which had pulled up on the road.\n\nSunday, 30th.\u2014This very day we were to be at Ubon! We set off in advance at a canter. In an hour we were on the banks of the Seimun, opposite the town. The river, though very low at that time, seemed as broad as the Loire at the Pont de la Belle Croix, at Nantes. We followed the bank upstream, it being about six o'clock in the morning. P\u00e8re\nJOURNEY THROUGH LAOS FROM BANGKOK TO UBON.\n\nXAVIER pointed out to me the site of our station, but I could not make it out in consequence of the trees and bushes which cover the banks. We soon dismounted and fired several rounds. I blew a horn also. We were heard; the children were the first to arrive, followed soon after by the grown-up people. Mass was just over when our signals announced our arrival. The two P\u00e8res came down at last; not too robust either of them, fever having tried them severely. They procured us a boat which took us across the river with our steeds. With what joy did we embrace one another!\n\nOur first act was to enter the humble chapel and to thank God for the protection granted to us by Him during so long a journey. Some hours later our carts arrived, and during the afternoon we conveyed them across in boats. Blessed be God for ever.\n\nG.

It was to no purpose that his widow offered to pay one hundred thousand ducats if their lives were spared.\n\nIntent then on revenging herself, she promised her daughter in marriage to a Moor called Paticatir (Osorius calls him Pasecatir and Mappejus, Quiterius) who had been appointed head of the Moors by Albuquerque, on condition that he should avenge the death of her husband, son and brother-in-law, Paticatir having often previously in vain asked for her hand while Isutinutis was still alive.\n\n(1) \"Pati Cnus,\" according to Farla y Souza, who afterwards became King of Sunda.\nThe marriage having been concluded quite secretly, the widow engaged 6,000 troops, and with their aid attempted to carry his plots into execution, but Albuquerque put him to flight on the first engagement, and thus broke up at once all his power and influence.\n\nHaving established peace here in 1511, Albuquerque appointed Rodrigo Brit Patalyn first Governor of Malakka, and Ninachetu Shahbandar and head of the Moors. Saina-lahin, the King of Pasi (Pasci), who had once before deserted to Mahmud, was again restored to favour, but notwithstanding went over a second time to the enemies of Albuquerque.\n\nAlbuquerque then left Malakka in charge of Patalyn with a garrison of 300 Portuguese, sent one of his captains with a squadron of ten sail to the Singapore Straits, and returned with four vessels to Malaar (Malabar?) to keep a watchful eye upon the plots of Arabidchain against Goa.\n\nHe, however, not only failed to carry out his expedition, but narrowly escaped with his life, his vessel having struck and sunk in a storm off Pasi on the Island of Sumatra. Though this happened at night, he and his crew were saved; but he lost Nakhuda Begu'a's bracelet with the precious blood-stanching stone. (1)\n\nAfter suffering many distresses and being almost starved, they arrived safely at Cucheen (Cochin on West Coast of India) in February, 1512.\n\nMeantime the Portuguese (at Malakka) had been again attacked by Paticatir, but he was so completely defeated by Petrejus Andrado that he did not venture a further attempt. The Pati Onius (*) previously mentioned from Japira, who had eight years before promised his aid to Raja Isutintis, now at last appeared before Malakka with a fleet of 3,000 (*) sail, having secured at the same time many adherents in the town itself, but he likewise met with total defeat, and barely succeeded\n\n(1) For an account of this wonderful ornament, see pp. 73 and 74 Journal, S.B., R.A.S., No. 13 for June, 1884, and note.\n(*) Pati Cnus.\n(**) Faria y Souza says ninety sail, which sounds more probable, with 1,200 men (an average of 133 to each vessel) and a good supply of artillery.\nin escaping himself in a small craft, the only one left of the whole fleet, after losing more than 8,000 men. (1) The loss of the Portuguese on the other hand was not more than 20 men killed though they had many wounded in this severe engagement. The Portuguese Governor Patalyn and his Captain Andrado were much praised by Albuquerque for their gallant behaviour.\n\nOnce again Malakka ran the risk of being reconquered by the Malay kings. Taefar Madjelis (Tuan No Maselis according to Portuguese historians) a Moor from Bengal, was the originator of this new plot. Being on good terms with one Peter Person, a friend of the Governor, he had arranged with his adherents that he should first kill Person, and this was to be the signal for a general massacre. A few days afterwards having been invited to dinner by Person, he tried to execute his plot, but instead of killing Person, he only wounded him; this of course caused an alarm and frustrated all their plans. (2)\n\n(1) Faria y Souza's account agrees as to the completeness of Pati Cunis's defeat, but differs in his account of his fleet, concerning which he remarks:\u2014\"Several of his ships were equal in size to the largest Portuguese galleons, and the one destined for himself was larger than any ships then built by the Europeans.\" And, again:\u2014\"After a furious battle of some endurance, Unus fled, and was pursued all the way to Java, where he preserved his own vast vessel as a memorial of his escape, and of the grandeur of his fleet, and not without reason, as a merchant of Malakka engaged to purchase it of Percy for 10,000 ducats if taken.\"\n\n(2) Faria y Souza's account of this affair is as follows:\u2014King Mahomet had not yet lost all hope of recovering Malakka, to which he now drew near; and having in vain attempted to succeed by force, he had recourse to stratagem. For this purpose he prevailed on a favourite officer named Juan Maxiliz to imitate the conduct of Zoritus at Babylon. Being accordingly mutilated, Juan fled with some companions to Malakka, giving out that he had escaped from the tyrannical cruelty of his sovereign. Ruy de Brito, who then commanded in the citadel of Malakka, credited his story, and reposed so much confidence in his fidelity that he was admitted at all times into the fortress. At length, having appointed a particular day for the\nWhen the King of Djohor found that all his attempts miscarried, he deemed it advisable to conclude a permanent peace with the Portuguese (1514), which was preserved for some years.\n\nThe Viceroy Alfonsus Albukir sent his cousin George Albukir the same year (1514), to Malakka to succeed the valiant Rodrigo Patalyn as second Governor of that place (Malakka).\n\nNinachetu was dismissed at the same time, and the King of Campar appointed Shahbandar (1) in his place (no one knew the cause of his dismissal); he was so chagrined at this that he committed suicide by burning himself on a pile after delivering a solemn speech to the people.\n\nAbdallah, the King of Campar, was soon afterwards attacked by the King of Bentan, but with the assistance of the Portuguese easily beat off his enemy. But some years later the King of Djohor induced the Portuguese, by false imputations, to suspect the King of Campar his own son-in-law, so that they bribed assassins to kill him; but it is also said that he was publicly executed on a charge of conspiring to surrender Malakka to the enemies of the Portuguese. (2)\n\n(1) Faria y Souza says \"Bandara,\" i.e., \"Bendahara.\"\n\n(2) This is the account given by Faria y Souza, who says that Mahomed, the King of Johor, caused it to be noised abroad that Abdallah, his own son-in-law, had gone to Malacca with his knowledge and consent for the express purpose of getting an opportunity of seizing the fort by a sudden and unexpected attack, which false\nGeorge Brit succeeded (1515) George Albuquerque as third Governor of Malakka, just before the arrival of the new Viceroy of India, Lopez Toarez Alvarenga, successor of Alfonso Albuquerque.\n\nNothing of importance happened while Brit was Governor. He died here (at Malakka) in 1517. This death gave rise to sharp disputes between two high Portuguese Officials as to the succession, and Ferdinand Petrejus Andrade, who touched at Malakka on his voyage homewards from China, tried in vain to reconcile them. Meantime whilst Noguez Vasco Pereira was temporarily administering the Government, Alfonso Lopez Costa had been appointed fourth Governor of Malakka by King Emanuel.\n\nThe King of Djobor, being disinclined to suffer the Portuguese to remain any longer in such quiet possession of Malakka, waged war against them once more, attacked them suddenly, and had some very sharp engagements with one Alexis de Menezes, (1) the Portuguese commander, but without obtaining the slightest advantage. When de Menezes had left, the King resumed his attack on the town, besieged the fortress for seventeen days, and made an assault on it, but was repulsed by the Portuguese. After this last defeat he remained quiet for a short time.\n\nThe new Viceroy, Didacus Lopez Sequeira, appointed one Correa Captain of the Portuguese Garrison at this place in 1519 to frustrate the repeated attacks of King Ahmed Sjah, and one Garcia de Sala to be fifth Governor to relieve the invalid Governor Alfonso Lopez Costa.\n\nA little before this the King of Djobor had made another attack upon the town, but being again repulsed with great\n\n(1) According to Faria y Sousa, this attack was made in the time of Brit (or Brito), and De Menezes arrived to assume the Government with a reinforcement of 300 men just in time to prevent Malakka falling into the hands of the enemy, and appointed Costa Deputy Governor in place of Brito, who was dying.\nloss and disgrace, (1) he abandoned his plans for a long time.\n\nIn 1521 Garcia de Sala was succeeded by another Governor. During his governorship George Albukirke and Antonio Brit came this way for the purpose of besieging Bintam, but it did not come to anything. (2) Garcia de Sala in that year (1521) resigned the governorship to George Albukirke, who was thus the sixth Portuguese Governor. In 1522 the people of Bintam again came forth against Malakka with eighty vessels, but George Albukirke having been already informed that the Laksamana of Djohor was coming with a numerous and powerful fleet, despatched a strong Portuguese fleet to meet him, and a fierce fight ensued. Sixty-five Portuguese were killed, and their vessels were compelled to retreat to Malakka; the Laksamana likewise quietly withdrew.\n\nMeantime several Portuguese, who had landed at Pahang in ignorance that the King there was son-in-law to the King of Djohor were murdered; many others were compelled by the King of Djohor to embrace the Mahomedan faith, while those who refused to do so were tied to the mouth of a cannon and blown to pieces.\n\nAbout this time also a force from Bintam appeared before the town (Malakka) took Simon de Breo and thirteen Portuguese by surprise, slew them all, and burnt their vessels. Garcia Henrik who, on his return from the Moluccas, was cruising off the island of Bintam, was drawn into an ambuscade by the vessels of the Laksamana, lost both his vessels, and was obliged to retreat to Malakka after making a gallant defence, in which almost all his men were killed.\n\nAll these small advantages gained over the Portuguese made the King of Djohor so proud, that he again entertained the idea of attacking Malakka by sea and land and making a\n\n(1) Faria y Souza says the King of Bintang (Bentan) which is practically the same thing, and that the Portuguese succeeded in taking the Malay Fort at Moar with 300 cannon.\n\n(2) Faria y Souza describes Bentan as \"having two strong castles and its rivers staked to prevent the access of ships, so that it was considered almost impregnable, and though Alvaro Querque went with 18 vessels and 600 men, he was obliged to retire.\"\nfresh effort to expel the Portuguese. He then collected a force of 20,000 men, 16,000 of which he despatched by land under the command of a renegade Portuguese Captain called Amlaar, while the Laksamana had to take the other 4,000 men to blockade the Malakka roadstead.\n\nAmlaar immediately marched on the town and very soon succeeded in making a trench sixty palisades wide near the village of Quillyn [i.e., Kampong Kling, as it is termed], but he was unable to take advantage of it, for George Albukirk had it repaired at once.\n\nThe siege lasted for about a month, after which it was raised and the besiegers beat a retreat, on hearing that relief had been sent from Goa. This happened about 1525. They had hardly left when Martyn Alfonso de Souza arrived with a fleet to the rescue of the town, and he was told that during the siege people had paid fifty ducats for a fowl.\n\nThe Governor appointed the said de Souza Admiral of the Portuguese fleet in place of his cousin Garcia Henrik, and the very first act of the new Admiral was to blockade the river of Bintam with five vessels and so prevent the entrance or egress of anything.\n\nIn 1526 Peter Mascarenhas was appointed Governor of Malakka, being the seventh Portuguese Governor.\n\nThe King of Djohor soon after again besieged the town, but the brave Mascarenhas would not brook such provocation; he began to take aggressive action, and declared war against the King of Bintam, who called his son-in-law of Pahang to his aid, but both the Laksamana of Bintam and the King of Pahang's Admiral were completely defeated and put to flight, and the Portuguese conquered the whole island (i.e., Bentan). The said King of Bintam (a creature of the King of Djohor, the lawful King having been expelled) died of grief soon after. The other King then re-appeared and submitted to the Portuguese who restored him to his throne.\n\n(*) Faria y Souza states that Mascarenhas took Bentan with twenty-one ships and four hundred Portuguese soldiers and six hundred Malays under Tuan Mahomed and one Sinai Raja, though it was well fortified and defended by seven thousand men.\nAfter the taking of Bintam, the King of Djohor left the Portuguese unmolested for some time.\n\nIn 1527 Georg Kapraal was appointed eighth Governor of Malakka, and nothing of importance occurred during his government, the King of Djohor being still at peace with the Portuguese.\n\nIn 1528 the Viceroy Lopez de Sampaio appointed Peter de Far ninth Governor of Malakka, and his government was also a peaceful one, the King of Djohor not having yet recovered the shock his power had received.\n\nIn 1529 Garcia de Sa arrived at Malakka as the tenth Portuguese Governor.\n\nThe inhabitants of Atsjien (in Sumatra) gave him much trouble, but we will treat the subject later, when we deal with the affairs of that island, mentioning only this that Garcia having discovered that one Sanage was conspiring with the enemy ordered him to be thrown out of the tower of the fortress.\n\nI cannot say who succeeded Garcia de Sa as Governor of Malakka, but I have been able to trace the names and dates of the following Governors, viz., Stephanus Gama in 1537, Ruy Paz Pareira in 1545, Simon Melo in 1547, Pedro de Silva in 1551, and his brother Don Albaro Ataydo in 1552.\n\nI am equally ignorant of the names of the Governors from the last-mentioned date up to 1604, when that brave Portuguese Don Andrea Furtado de Mendoza (of whom we will speak more at length later) administered the supreme authority as Governor of this place.\n\nWe cannot say much about the events of that period, the Portuguese historians having recorded nothing about them.\n\nAhmed Shah, the exhausted King of Djohor (i.e., after the failure of his repeated attacks on the Portuguese), continued to rule his country till 1540, and was succeeded after a reign of twenty-seven years by Sultan Alawoddin Shah, (\"Ala-eddin Shah,\" Malay \"Ala-edin\") who was the fourteenth King of the Malays, the second of Djohor, and the eighth Mahomedan King.\nIt was during the reign of this King (9th October, 1547) that the AChinese laid siege to Malakka, causing damage to the value of more than a million, and only raising the siege on account of famine.\n\nWe have found nothing recorded of the life of this King and of his successor, beyond the fact that he reigned 19 years, i.e., from 1540 to 1559, and that he was succeeded by Sultan Abdul Djalil Sjah as the fifteenth King of the Malays, the third of Djohor, and the ninth Mahomedan King.\n\nThis prince ruled this people 32 years, died in 1591, and was succeeded by Sultan Alawuddin Sjah III. He, the sixteenth King of the Malays, the fourth of Djohor, and the tenth Mahomedan King, reigned 19 years.\n\nIt seems to me that the first Dutch made their appearance either at this place (Malakka) or at Djohor in the twelfth or thirteenth year of this reign (i.e., in 1693 or 1604).\n\nIt appears also that he (Alawuddin Sjah III) was styled Yangdiptuan, that he resided at Batoc Sabar, (*) six miles higher up the river (i.e., above Johor Lama) and that he had a brother, called Radja Bongsoe, who lived on friendly terms with the Dutch.\n\n(*) Faria y Souza makes it in October, 1571, and states that the AChinese raised the siege on Tristhan Vaz de Vega completely defeating a Malay fleet in the Moar river; it may be a separate occasion, but it looks like the same, and Souza makes no mention of the one referred to at the date given in the text, which seems to have been so serious that he would hardly have omitted to notice it.\n\nHe also mentions in the time of de Vega an attack on Malacca by a fleet sent by the Queen of Japara consisting of eighty large galleons and two hundred and twenty smaller vessels, but the besiegers were severely defeated after a siege of three months. This was almost immediately followed by an attack by the AChinese, who, however, abandoned the siege in a panic, thinking there were some special stratagems being devised against them. When as a matter of fact, the Portuguese were in sore straits, and might easily have been overcome.\n\n(*) \"Sawar\" said to mean a kind of fishing-weir. (See Malay Proverbs, No. 2 of Journ., S.B., R.A.S., p. 145.)\nI find that one Roche de Mello was Portuguese Governor of Malakka in 1593.\n\nI think that probably Admiral Jacob Heemskerk was the first of our people who had any trade with the King of Djohor; he captured a large Portuguese carrack on his return voyage from China, touched at Djohor, and left behind there in 1693 one Jacob Buyzen, who would, he was sure, be treated as a friend, the King being a mortal foe of the Portuguese, and doing his utmost to harass them.\n\nWhen in October, 1693, the vessels Ziericzee and Hollandse Thayn (Dutch garden) under the command of Commodore Jacob Pieterzoon van Enkhuizen (forming part of the fleet under Wybrand van Warwyck) arrived at the Singapore Straits, they met with a prahu or canoe of the King of Djohor bringing a letter from Jacob Buyzen, which informed them that during the last month two Portuguese men-of-war, four galleys, and twenty smaller craft had arrived at that place, under the command of Estevan Texeira de Made, a man of great fame; that these vessels were waiting for some ships, which were expected to arrive there within a couple of months from Japan and Macassar, and which they had to escort safely to Malakka out of danger from the Dutch vessels.\n\nIt appeared from a letter of the supercargo Jacob Buyzen, dated the 7th October, that the Portuguese of Malakka were besieging Djohor, and the King wrote to our Commodore to beg him most earnestly, that our troops might assist him in relieving his city from this siege. Buyzen added, besides, that Radja Bongsoe, the King's brother, intended to come very soon on board the Commodore's vessel and to remain there till their joint efforts should have vanquished the Portuguese; it, was this very Radja Bongsoe who was with Admiral Heemskerk when he had captured the carrack already mentioned.\n\nOur Commodore then gave battle to the Portuguese fleet during the whole day and put her to flight right through ours, whereupon Radja Bongsoe and Jacob Buyzen after having witnessed this naval combat, arrived on board the Commodore's vessel, and Radja Bongsoe after having thanked him cordially for the eminent service he had done them, presented him with a fine kris, after which he and Buyzen left him.\nThe only losses we suffered in that fight, were five or six men killed, and a few men wounded on both vessels. The King of Djohor, much pleased with this victory, and with our assistance, arrived that very night with his fleet of forty prahus and four or five fine galleys near our two vessels, when he was visited by our Commodore in his own galley, to whom that Prince likewise showed his gratitude by presenting him with a splendid kris.\n\nWhen the Commodore made some inquiries about pepper, the King answered him, that he would be able to forward some to him within a short time, if his river were kept open and free.\n\nRadja Bongsoz, accompanied by many Malay gentlemen, came again on board of the vessel Ziericzee on the 10th October; we fought the Portuguese that day, and put them again at flight, but the King, though he was present with his prahus, left all the work to be done by us, and only looked on.\n\nHe then visited the Commodore accompanied by his two brothers (one of whom was the King of Siak), and offered him his thanks; the Commodore then presented him with a Japanese sword with a silver hilt and sheath, and Radja Bongsoz with a fine musket, whereupon that Prince took leave of him.\n\nOn the 1st September, 1633, Andrea Furtado de Mendoza succeeding Fernando Albuqir as Governor of Malakka, as Governor-General of the Southern Provinces of India, and as Commander-in-Chief of the royal fleet, sent in the beginning of 1604 an Ambassador to the said King of Djohor to acquaint him with this change, and to announce to him that he wished to live in peace with him, though he had been at war with the former Governor of Malakka.\n\nThe King sent the reply, that he too desired to make peace, but that he wanted to know first the terms of that peace.\n\nDon Andrea Furtado then required that the King should part with the Dutch (having dealt already too much with them), deliver them up to him, and deprive them of their property, and he informed him that there should never be peace if the King of Djohor would not accept the said conditions. On the 8th February the King gave a flat refusal, and briefly said that he would rather see his whole country ruined than\nbetray or deliver up the Dutch, who stood under his protection.\n\nThe 3rd May, 1604, Admiral Warwyck having returned to the Johor river, the King presented him with two and a half pharas of pepper, whilst he presented the King with a quantity of powder and some balls. He sailed again on the 20th of the same month.\n\nIn February 1605, Furtado resolved to besiege Batoe Sabar, but when he heard that our Admiral Wybrand van Warwyck was in its very neighbourhood, he gave up his plan.\n\nOn the 14th of the same month, our Admiral was informed, that in the meantime the Portuguese fleet had been reinforced considerably, numbering now 7 men-of-war, 30 bantings, 20 galleys, and 10 Javanese sampans, and further that Andrea Furtado had threatened the King with an early visit, and if he again failed to conquer Batoe Sabar he would willingly pay the King tribute.\n\nIn the meantime some vessels of our fleet, under the command of Admiral C. Sebastiaanse, had captured off Patani a fine and richly laden Portuguese carrack, called St. Anthony, and the Wissingen (joining the said Admiral's squadron off Patani in February that year) had also captured on the 14th January, 1605, off Pedra Blanca another carrack coming from Cochin-China and consigned to Don Andrea Furtado.\n\nWe found in the first carrack the following goods, viz:\u2014\n\n- 2,000 piculs of white powder-sugar and some baskets of sugar-candy;\n- 4,500 piculs of Tintenaga or Spelter (zinc);\n- 223 fardels of Chinese camphor;\n- 90 fardels Agelwood; (1)\n- 18 leaden boxes of musk-balls;\n- 11 boxes of vermilion;\n- 22 boxes of Chinese fans;\n- 209 fardels of raw silk, and 75 fardels bad yellow silk;\n- 6,000 pieces of variegated porcelain;\n- 10 casks of coarse and fine porcelain;\n\n(1) \"K\u00e4yu gaharu.\"\nsome gilt couches and knick-knacks, one lot radix China, (1) one lot benzoin, 150 baskets with prepared silk, velvet, damask, tafteta and fine silk, besides some boxes with gold-wire.\n\nIn the second carrack we found:\u2014\n\n174\u00bd piculs of Agelwood;\n38\u00bd piculs of Benzoin; (*)\n2 small casks with Chinese camphor, and some common sarongs.\n\nThe Wissingen had captured another small Portuguese ship off Solor, laden with ninety-two bharas Sandal-wood and 2\u00bd pikuls of tortoise-shell.\n\nThe Wissingen sailed on the 15th September with the captured carrack St. Anthony from Patani to Djohor to try and get a cargo at that place. Wybrand van Warwyck followed on the 27th October, and dropped anchor on the 12th November in the mouth of the Djohor river near the said carrack at about 1\u00bd miles from the Wissingen. The vessels Amsterdam and Dordrecht were under his command. Admiral Cornelis Sebastiaanse's squadron was also lying in the roads here.\n\nThe King called in the aid of both these Admirals, which Sebastiaanse pledged himself to give, whilst van Warwyck begged to excuse him for this time.\n\nThe letters, addressed by H. H. Prince Maurice to the King, were then presented to him, which he received with much respect. Admiral Cornelis Sebastiaanse presented him at the time with two brass guns, and van Warwyck gave him four small barrels of gunpowder, 40 shot-cartridges for the said cannon, 12 Japanese swords, four Portuguese muskets with shoulder-belts, some pieces of prepared silk and a shot-proof armour.\n\nThe two Admirals presented the King at his request with two small wide-mouthed guns cannon-royal, and some shot-\n\n(1) \"Jin seng,\" or \"Jinsam,\" as it is also called, supposed to be very invigorating. It is stated that it is only found near the mountains. A man shoots an arrow, and if it falls where the \"jin seng\" is to be found, a flame appears, which guides him to the spot.\n\n(*) \"Kru\u010dnyan,\" burnt by Malays and aborigines in most of their charms and spells.\ncartridges for the same, from the vessel Dordrecht and with an iron pederero (small field piece) and ten small barrels of gunpowder and some shot-cartridges from one of Warwyck's vessels, in order that he should be better able to repel the assaults of the Portuguese.\n\nAdmiral van Warwyck left Djohor on the 10th December with his vessel the Wissingen, after having strongly recommended the King to take good care of his people, who were left behind with a valuable cargo, and the Admiral Sebastiaanse soon followed him with his vessel the Amsterdam and the carrack St. Anthony.\n\nAt the beginning of January, 1606, our Admiral Cornelis Matelief de Jonge having met with Admiral Steven van der Hagen off the island of Mauritius, and having heard from him in what state Malakka was, set sail with his fleet to that town, but Don Andrea Furtado had fortified it considerably during the last three years, and besieged Djohor with an army of 8,000 men. The said Admiral sailed for Malakka on the 27th January and dropped anchor on the 30th April at half a mile distance from the town. (1)\n\nHe at once manned all his boats and sloops and ordered them to set fire to four ships, just aground opposite the town. These were ships of 200, 100, and 80 lasts each. Though the garrison fired five shots, they all missed the brats.\n\nThe same night Matelief informed the King of his arrival.\n\nThe day before, our sloops having captured three prahus of the King of Quedah, loaded with sarongs, the Admiral sent them back to that King and assured him, that he wished to live in peace with him.\n\nThe Admiral then assembled a Council of war, and the Council of all the shipmasters and merchants, and they resolved to approach as near Malakka as five fathoms of water (1) would bring them, and to bombard the town from the fleet.\n\nThe vessels neared the coast with neap tide to a depth of 3\u00bd fathoms of water, (1) but even at that distance their small cannons-royal were of no use; though a few balls did hit some of the houses, they could not reach the fortress.\n\n(1) There is something wrong about the distances and cannon range here, perhaps \"league\" should be read for \"mile?\"\nThe artillery of the town answered our fire; but the Wille Leeuw (White Lion), was the only vessel once hit, whilst the most effective shot from our side, was the one, that hit the St. Paulus Church, so-named by the Dutch; Albuquerque dedicated it to \"Our Lady of the Annunciation,\" belonging to the order of the Jesuits.\n\nMatelief in the meantime ordered four boats to survey the North side of the town, and to take soundings, for if possible he intended to land there and to take its suburb; but he had to abandon his plan, the soil being too muddy, the Portuguese having raised strong stockades there to defend their houses.\n\nHe had erected in the meantime a battery of 24 pounders at Ilha das Naos, (1) one of the islets near the town, and had equipped it also with two small cannons-royal, and intended to bombard the town from that place, it being much nearer than the nearest place where the vessels could anchor.\n\nOur Admiral having been informed in the meantime that it was almost impossible to make a descent on the south side of the town, intended to land on its north side, hence he garrisoned the said islet with some 30 men.\n\nWe then opened our fire from the battery of the 24 pounders in the afternoon of the 2nd May, and soon silenced the two batteries on the south side of the town.\n\nNow and then the artillery of the town fired at our vessels, but without any effect; they did not fire at the battery however. But when Matelief saw that all this firing to and fro was of no use, he deliberated with his Captains, whether it would be better to leave the town alone and go first to meet and give battle to the Portuguese fleet, or whether it would be more advisable to take the town first; after a mature deliberation he resolved to ask the opinion of the King of Djohor, chiefly because he wanted to make sure if the latter would help him and what his assistance would consist of.\n\nThey did not expect much from the aid of the King of Djohor, but they forwarded a message to him, and it was decided that they should wait for his answer, before acting in any way; the more that there was nothing known about the arrival of the Portuguese fleet.\n\n(1) Pulau Jawa, lying opposite St. Paul's Hill.\nMeanwhile the Portuguese had burnt down the southern suburb.\n\nMatelief ordered ten men of the crew of each vessel to Pulau Sapta, (1) a pretty big island about two miles from Malakka, to make ten gabions for each vessel, to be used when they should attack the town.\n\nMatelief was informed on the 4th May, that our fire had wounded some of the inhabitants of the town, and that the Portuguese fleet with the Viceroy and Archbishop on board was soon expected from Goa, first to come to the rescue of Malakka, and then to reconquer the Moluccas and to fight the King of Djohor; that the place had but very little victuals, but that there were many guns with a large supply of ammunition, that there were more than 3,000 slaves and Malays within the town, but not more than 80 Europeans.\n\nOn the 5th of May, two prahus of the King of Djohor, with the Siaibandar of Singapura, Sri R\u00e2ja Negara, (2) reached our fleet; they came to see if there were Dutch vessels in this neighbourhood, and they assured our Admiral, that it was certain that the King would come this way as soon as he knew of the Admiral's presence, so they would go back that very night.\n\nOn the 13th, the Admiral received a letter from the King of Djohor informing him that he should join him within four days, and that he should bring as many troops as he could assemble.\n\nAfter the receipt on the 14th of a letter of the same tenor, there appeared on the 17th some vessels with three hundred men under the command of the King's brother Radja Sabrang, he (the King) being absent.\n\nThe then reigning King of Djohor, called Jangdiertochan, was the eldest of three brothers. He was a lazy and indolent prince, sleeping almost the whole day, getting drunk, and amusing himself with his women, whilst he left the business\n\n(1) Probably Pulau Upeh (which is somewhere about 2\u00bd miles from the town, but then, as may be seen by the rocks on its shore side, extending further towards the town), as they were going to attack on the North side.\n\n(2) Royal drum; or possibly connected with Sansk: nagara or nagari, country.\nof government to his brother, Radja Sabrang, or Radja Bongsoe, and to the high court dignitaries.\n\nHis other brother, the King of Siak, who had married a daughter of the King, or a sister of the Queen of Patani, was also a bad sovereign; he came very seldom to Djohor, but remained at Siak, which was a fief of Djohor.\n\nThe third brother, who, like the King of Siak, was also of another mother, was called Radja Laut; but the said three princes were not to be relied upon, owing to their fondness for drinking. Radja Sabrang was the only exception.\n\nHe then came to welcome the Admiral, and presented him a golden kris inlaid with some common diamonds.\n\nThey had a long talk together, and Matelief told him that it was his intention to take Malakka and to keep it for him, but Radja Bongsoe did not like that, and asked him, why he should assist him to besiege the town, if after all the Dutch would keep the place, for in that case it was only a change of neighbours, and that we did not assist him, but that he then assisted us.\n\nMatelief then asked him, what would be his reward if he took the town, whereupon Radja Sabrang promised him to give him a suitable place for building store-houses to put their goods and provisions in, which they were allowed to import duty free. But Matelief answered that his offer amounted to nothing, that many native princes had made him the same offer, though he had never rendered them any services; he also pointed out that the present town of Malakka did not belong to the King of Djohor, but that it was a town built by the Portuguese, and that only the surrounding country had at one time been the property of the King.\n\nFinally, he gave in about the town and agreed to leave Malakka in our possession, if Matelief would promise to make war upon Atsjien, which Matelief however refused to do, being at peace with that State; but he promised that, either he would assist the King of Djohor if Atsjien declared war against him, or he would do his best to appease the King of Atsjien.\n\nFinally, the following agreement was entered into on the 17th May, 1606, and signed by the different parties:\u2014\n1. Admiral Matelief promises to take Malakka from the Portuguese with the aid and assistance of Djohor, after which the town will remain in the power of the States-General (Holland), but the surrounding country will be under the King of Djohor, provided we shall be allowed to take of it as much as we may require to fortify the town;\n\n2. The States-General are allowed to cut timber in the territory of the King, to build ships, and to provide for all the other necessities of the town;\n\n3. All the vassals of the States-General are allowed to discharge their ships and to land their goods in the town without paying any duty;\n\n4. No other Dutch or European merchants may trade in the countries of the King, without first having obtained leave from our Governor at Malakka to do so, and they will be considered enemies if they trade without the said permission;\n\n5. His Majesty can re-people and govern the burnt down suburb, known under the name of Campo Clin, (*) without any interference of the States-General. His Majesty shall if possible take up his residence at that place and fortify it, whilst the States-General shall assist him to do so;\n\n6. All the guns and cannon which are found in the town after its conquest shall belong to the King, one part of which he is allowed to remove at once, whilst he must leave the other part for the defence of the town, until the States-General shall have provided it with other artillery;\n\n7. All the merchandize, money and any other goods that shall be found in the town are to be divided in two portions, one to go to the States-General, the other to the King;\n\n8. Any goods not belonging to vassals of the States-General must be landed in the said suburb [Campo Clin]; but the subjects of the States-General are allowed to purchase them there freely and to carry them from there to the town;\n\n9. Both parties promise to assist each other faithfully, against the Portuguese and Spaniards, but not in the case of a war with another nationality, unless it be to stand upon the defensive only;\n\n(*) i.e., Kampong Kling.\n10. Neither of the two parties shall make peace with the King of Spain, without the consent of the other;\n11. If any subject of either party gives offence in matters of religion, the offender shall be brought up and punished by his own authorities;\n12. If any subject of one of the two parties has a claim in the way of debt upon a subject of the other party, the defendant shall be called before his own authorities;\n13. Both parties bind themselves to surrender deserters or runaway criminals.\n\nThe said treaty was sworn to and signed by both parties, by each of them according to the customs of his country.\n\nThe Admiral then delivered to Radja Sahrang a letter addressed to the King and coming from His Highness Prince Maurice, which letter was accompanied by the presents also sent to the King by the said Prince, which presents consisted of a long fusil, a double-barrelled pistol inlaid with mother-of-pearl, two other pistols, a sword of honour, and a halberd, besides those sent by the Directors of the East India Company, consisting of one fine harness, two halbords and six cuirasses.\n\nMr. Matelief therupon landed on the 18th May, with 700 men, and falling in with a troop of 400 Portuguese and black soldiers armed with muskets and pikes, he immediately attacked them, and drove them back to the suburb.\n\nFinding a strong thick wall there (1) they at once threw up an entrenchment, from behind which they opened such a hot fire upon the enemy, that he had to abandon his position, which was set fire to by its own inhabitants.\n\nAfter having made a rapid personal examination of the town, Mr. Matelief found near it a pretty large river, (2) which to cross would be rather a hard task, seeing as he did so many strong turrets and such solid heavy walls round the town that it would have been very easy for the Portuguese to prevent him from taking the town; besides that he had not forces\n\n(1) Pintu Tranquerah?\n(2) The Malacca river separating the fortress and main town from the suburbs.\nenough for the purpose, many of his soldiers being laid up already with sickness, and as for the assistance of the Malays, he did not feel inclined to rely too much upon it.\n\nIn the meantime he ordered his troops with the assistance of the Malays to construct a battery in the said suburb, and armed it with two 17 pounders, with which he intended to silence the fire of the enemy on that side of the town.\n\nBy this time Mr. Matelief had noticed, that whenever he had asked Radja Sabrang for the help of his men he indeed promised to send him people, but they never appeared; and concluding that there was something amiss between the King of Djohor and his brother, he became aware, that he was knocking at a deaf man's door, the more so that they had conceived a sentiment of jealousy against each other. Finally, becoming convinced that he could never take the town with the small number of troops under his command, he thought it advisable to raise the siege and re-embark his troops, especially when the Randahara had told him plainly that the Malays intended to leave the whole business to us, under pretence that Ternate and Ambon had also been taken by us without the assistance of the natives.\n\nI wish to take this opportunity of correcting an erroneous statement I made in foot-note (5) p. 50 of No. 13 of this Journal for June, 1884. The arms on the old gateway there mentioned are not Portuguese, though I was so informed by a Portuguese Consul, but Dutch after all, the Batavian lion is clear.\n\nD. F. A. H.\nNOTICES OF BOOKS.\n\nRapport \u00e0 M. le Ministre de l'Instruction Publique sur une Mission aux Iles Philippines et en Malaisie (1879-1881), par M. le Docteur J. Montano. Paris, Hachette, 1885.\n\nEvery contribution to the scientific literature of the Philippines is of value, for though these islands have been under European dominion for over 300 years, it is astonishing how much there is still to be learned about them. There is no complete work which embraces the whole subject of the geology, geography, and natural history of this group. One has to look for the botany in old Fray Blanco's work, or pursue it through the voluminous pages of A. de Candolle's Prodromus. A valuable illustrated work on the forest flora of the Philippines has been lately published at Manila by Se\u00f1or Vidal. But both works are incomplete. The geology of the island may be sought in the various papers supplied to the Boletino del Carte Geologico di Espana, a work now extending to many volumes. M. Jagor has given many valuable details in his Reisen in den Philippinen (Berlin 1873), a work which has been translated into Spanish, French, and English. There is also an Appendix by J. Roth on the geology of the islands. Baron Riehthoffen has published some observations on the nummulitic limestones of Binangonan. Finally, M. Vidal has published (Madrid, 1874) a Memoir on the mountains of the Philippines.\n\nIn the numerous works published by the monks about their missions, which are very voluminous, there are scattered notices of geology and natural history, which have more value than one would imagine from the imperfect state of scientific knowledge when they were written. In these may be found many interesting details of hurricanes, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions. The history of the Dominican Mission in the Philippines is in\nsix volumes, while the works of the Augustinians and Jesuits are too numerous to specify.\n\nIn spite of all these, however, a good general work embracing all the departments of science is still a desideratum, for the material of which Dr. Montano's Report is a contribution which cannot be too highly praised. His opportunities for observation have been considerable. He visited in succession Luzon, Calamianes, Palawan, Balabac, Mindanao, and Panay, besides making long journeys inland, especially in the little known island of Mindanao. His qualifications for making the most of such opportunities appear to be of the highest order, and thus we have notices, necessarily brief it is true, in almost every department of science.\n\nThe Report is divided into five chapters, viz.:\u20141.\u2014Geology; 2.\u2014Meteorology; 3.\u2014Anthropology; 4.\u2014Pathology; 5.\u2014Dialects; 6.\u2014Political Geography, including Agriculture and Commerce. Zoology and Botany are to form the subjects of a subsequent work.\n\nOne would suppose, from the volcanic nature of these islands, that the geology would be somewhat uniform and that the author's notes would be confined to notices of volcanic products with investigations on the disturbances to which the group has been subjected. But sedimentary and fossiliferous rocks are not wanting in the islands. The formation ranges from the lower paleozoic to miocene, through, like all the eastern islands, mesozoic rocks appear to be wanting. The writer of this notice, when visiting the Calamianes group some few months back, was surprised to find the island of Coron and many other smaller islands entirely composed of precipitous limestone similar to what is found in Selangor and Perak in the Malay Peninsula. And what makes the resemblance still more striking is that immediately opposite, on the island of Culion, the rocks are paleozoic and ferruginous, decomposing into laterite just like what is found in the tin formations at Thaipeng. Limestone is also found in the north-west of Luzon, and also miocene rocks and broken fossils mostly of foraminifera. As a general rule, it may be said that the sedimentary rocks belong more to the southern islands. In Mindanao there are quartz veins with gold in slates, also tertiary rocks. There\nis also coal in the central and southern islands. Dr. Montano explored a good deal of the River Agusan in Mindanao. Between Bislig and Catel he found traces of an extensive upheaval of the coast line. Large banks of madrepore coral were raised above the level of the sea, extending in wide horizontal strata rounded by the waves which the north-east wind frequently dashes over them. The mineralogical notices in the Report are not very numerous, and the chapter concludes with a long account of earthquake phenomena. Of course, the great earthquake of 1880 is not passed over, but the author gives the account and diagrams of the Jesuit Padre Faura, which have been already published. Dr. Montano's remarks and observations on seismology are very interesting.\n\nThe meteorological portion of this work is less satisfactory, inasmuch as the author did not reside long enough in Malaysia or the Philippines to enable him to form any conclusions from actual observation. He might, however, have obtained excellent material from the published reports in Singapore, just as he has availed himself of the published reports of the Jesuit Observatory at Manila. These are very complete, but the whole subject, including that of typhoons, to which Manila is so liable, is about to be treated of in a separate work by Padre Faura, who, for many years, has been the Director of the Observatory of the Ateneo Municipal.\n\nThis Report is especially interesting in the department of ethnography, and much that is new will be found in it. The author gives a very full record of facts, which, as he has no theory of his own to support, appear to be entirely trustworthy. He describes the Negritos or aboriginal mountain tribes in a very full manner. They correspond to our Sakeis in Malaysia, and are quite distinct from the bulk of the native population throughout the island. They are divided into different tribes according to the mountains where they dwell. They have never been civilised in any way, and all attempts to reclaim them have failed. Even on Mariveles, close as these mountains are to the city of Manila, they are to be found, uncontrolled by the Spanish Government and occasionally killing a solitary Chinese or Tagal who strays into their mountain fastnesses.\nThe great portion of the natives or Indians who inhabit the lowlands of the islands belong to the tribes or races which are distinguished as Tagaloes, Bisayas or Vishayas, and Bicols. They are all branches from the Malay stock, with a somewhat marked approach to the Chinese type.\n\nThough I have said that Dr. Montano has no theory of his own to support, of course he has a system which he develops. He follows those who regard the people of Malaysia and all that portion of the great archipelago to the west of Flores, Ceram and Gilolo (the limit of the Papuan race) as belonging to three distinct races, viz.:\u2014the Negritos, the Indonesians, and the Malays. Dr. Montano limits the application of this system to the countries which he visited. As he saw very little of the Malay Peninsula, that portion of his work is incomplete.\n\nMaking every allowance for the changes and admixtures to which every race is subject, the author gives the following idea of the system. The islands are supposed to be divided into three zones. The Negritos, occupy the internal or mountain region to which they have been driven by the Indonesian invasion. The Indonesians occupy the central zone, where they have been driven in their turn by the Malay races, which almost exclusively occupy the external zone and are spread on all the coasts of the Indian Archipelago as far as Flores.\n\nSo far the idea is simple enough, but it soon becomes complicated, even when applied to the Philippine Islands alone. There we have the Negrito in the mountains, but in most of the islands there is not much trace of the Indonesian. We find ourselves in presence of a Malay race divided into three peoples, as we may call them, speaking three different languages, though all of undoubted Malay origin. There are the Bicols, the Tagaloes, and the Bisayans. These form the bulk of the population of the islands. The Negritos are rapidly disappearing and do not number in Luzon and Mindanao more than 500 souls. The Bicols are close on half-a-million; the Tagaloes about twelve hundred thousand; and the Bisayans two million and a half. Dr. Montano confines his observations to the Indonesians of Mindanao, and enumerates them as about fifty thousand.\n\nThe three great tribes of Malays already described are con-\nsidered as having a predominance of Chinese blood, and in the Gulf of Davao (Mindanao) and Sulu he finds Malays with a mixture of Arab and Indonesian blood. These are called Moors by the Spaniards and are all Mohammedans. They number about ten thousand souls.\n\nThe author divides the Negritos of Luzon and Mindanao into:\u20141.\u2014Negritos; 2.\u2014Mananua; 3.\u2014Negrito Mestizos. In Malacca he enumerates four tribes, namely:\u20141.\u2014Manthra, 2.\u2014Knabui, 3.\u2014Udai, and 4.\u2014Jakuns. Other Sakeis are not taken into account. Besides these, there are many Negritos in the other large islands of the Philippine group, such as Mindoro, Panay, &c., but of these Dr. Montano saw nothing.\n\nThere can be no doubt that there are three zones of races to be found in most of the larger islands of the Indian Archipelago. Nay more, we find the same or similar facts far beyond the limits ascribed to them by Dr. Montano. There are three zones of races very distinctly marked in Formosa, in Hainan probably, and there are even traces of the same in Japan. But when we come to analyze the constituents of these zones, the difficulty of classifying them under one head becomes manifest. In Borneo, for instance, the coast line is on the west, north and north-east overspread with Malays (Bajows), the central zone may roughly be said to be made up of the various tribes of Dusuns and Dyaks. But the Dusuns are of partly Chinese origin, and there does not seem to be anything in common between them and the Indonesians. In the centre we have wild mountain tribes, of which little is known, but yet sufficient to say that they are not Negritos.\n\nIn Formosa the Negritos of the mountains are a fierce savage tribe very like those of Luzon, but more treacherous. The central zone is a mixture of Chinese and possibly a Malay race, while the coast line is entirely Chinese. We have no traces of a distinct Indonesian population in the Malay Peninsula, but any person who pays much attention to the diversities of type amongst the Malays in the various States must see at once that some admixture of races must have taken place. Of course, the recent mestizos of Malay-Chinese and Indo-Malays are taken into account by Dr. Montano.\n\nThe portion of this work which is devoted to language will\nbe read with great interest by the student. The author states that all the dialects of the independent tribes which he visited belong to a family of languages which he calls Malayo-Polynesian. This result is the more important as it tends to throw some little light on the approximation which some have found between the Japanese language and the Polynesian. In Japanese, Malay words and a Malay structure are also slightly perceptible. What if the Polynesian races are the ultimate dispersion of a race which once spread over and peopled the east even as far as Japan? In the Philippines Dr. Montano takes Tagalog as the type, comprising under that group the Bicol and Bisaya dialects. They are almost as distinct from each other as they are from the Malay, but yet they are all of Malay origin beyond a doubt.\n\nThe author says that in all these languages or dialects there are no such things as parts of speech properly speaking. Theoretically all the words may be considered as roots and by themselves having no more than a vague sense. Their value as subject or object verb or quality is determined by affixes and suffixes less numerous in Malay than in the Tagalog dialects, where their use is extremely complicated. This renders the language difficult for Europeans. Yet most of the monks speak it fluently, and they have published so many and such excellent grammars and dictionaries of all the dialects that the study of them and the elucidation of their history is much facilitated. The Negritos have no language of their own, at least now in the Philippines. They speak a corrupted Tagalog. It is a pity that we know so little of the language of our Sakeis. Mr. J. E. de la Croix has published something on the subject (Journal of the Anthropological Institute, August and November, 1882), and we may hope that before long some of the officers of Government in the Malay Peninsula will take the matter up.\n\nDr. Montano gives very full vocabularies of Malay, Tagalog, Bisaya, Bul\u00e8d-Upih, Negrito, Samal, Manobo, Bagobo, Tagacaolo, Bilan, and Atas. The last five are small tribes in Mindanao with very distinct dialects. Bul\u00e8d-Upih is the language of the natives on the Kinabatangan River in north-east Borneo. The orthography of the Malay given in this book is peculiar, and adds one more to the ways of rendering that language accessible.\nto Europeans by odd combinations of letters. Dr. Montano's mode may be better than its predecessors, but at any rate it differs from them. At present no two books agree, and the student is fairly bewildered. Who will put an end to this confusion?\n\nConnected with the subject of ethnology, there are thirty beautifully executed phototypes by Quinsac. Their execution leaves nothing to be desired. There is also a plate representing microscopic sections of hair from various tribes. These sections show an oval, or sometimes a triangular and quadrangular outline, but never a cylindrical one.\n\nThe chapter on pathology is exceedingly interesting, containing as it does notices of all the various diseases amongst the natives which came under the author's notice. He also gives some well-considered observations on the effect of the climate upon Europeans. The subject, however, is too long to be dealt with here, and the same may be said on the chapters devoted to commerce and agriculture. This notice may be concluded by stating that Dr. Montano has contributed a most valuable addition to our knowledge of the Philippine Islands, which will hereafter be a standard work of reference on the subject. Scientific men will look forward anxiously to the portions especially devoted to zoology and botany. Even in this report there is a list of native names of plants with their corresponding botanical names and the orders to which they belong, amounting to 190 plants. A similar list is given by Vidal, which the writer of this notice has found most useful in travelling through the Philippines, but Montano's list contains tribal names which are not found elsewhere.\n\nJ. E. TENISON-WOODS.\n\n\"Work and Adventure in New Guinea, 1877 to 1885,\" by Rev. James Chalmers, and Rev. W. Wyatt Gill.\u2014The Religious Tract Society, 1885.\n\nJust a year has elapsed since Commodore Eskine proclaimed a British protectorate over a large portion of the southern shores of New Guinea extending from the limit of\nthe territory claimed by the Government of the Netherlands, about Longitude 141\u00b0 E., to East Cape including certain adjacent islands. A High Commissioner (Major-General Sir Peter Scratchley, R.E.) has been appointed, and may perhaps soon be heard of off the coast of the Protectorate. In the meantime the work of Messrs. Chalmers and Gill, which has been lately published, comes opportunely to afford the most recent information, from those best qualified to give it, of the territory in which Great Britain has acquired new interests and responsibilities, and of the manners and customs of the tribes inhabiting it.\n\nThe authors are missionaries of the London Missionary Society, but their book is no mere chronicle of mission work; it contains valuable ethnographical notes about comparatively unknown tribes, and records of exploration in new regions. The mission, which dates only from 1871, seems now to be firmly established; the head-quarters of the missionaries are at Port Moresby, while thirty-two native teachers, most of them South Sea Islanders, but some of them New Guinea converts, are stationed at various villages along the south-eastern coast of the great island between Motu-Motu and East Cape.\n\nThe only specimen of the language given consists of the names of the months (thirteen) and the numerals in the Motu dialect, which is used by the natives of Port Moresby. Other dialects are mentioned\u2014Roro, Hula, Koiali, &c.\u2014and the natives of different districts seem to be unintelligible to each other. At Teste Island several Polynesian words were recognised in the conversation of the natives with each other.\n\nThe people of Port Moresby speak of themselves as being of the same origin as the natives of the gulf of Papua. \"Two men sprung out of the earth\u2014Kerimaikuku and Kerimaikape\u2014but no woman; their only companion was a female dog. Anxious for children, a daughter and a son were born to them. When these were grown up they married, and children being born the inhabitants soon numbered fourteen. They then separated, two going right back to the mountains, and from them sprung the great Koiali tribe; two going not so far inland, and dwelling on the low lands and from them sprung the Koitapuans, a tribe of sorcerers; the remainder all going to Elema, where they remained many generations.\"\nThe only account that a mountain tribe in the interior of the Kabadi district could give of their faith was that their great spirit lived on the mountains and was called Oarova; he had a wife named Ooirova and they had a son called Kurorova.\n\nA native of Orokolo, a place at the head of the gulf of Papua, furnished the following particulars as to the beliefs of his tribe:\n\n\"The spirit Kanitu made two men and two women who came out of the earth. The name of the elder brother was Leleva and the younger Vovod; from them have sprung all mankind. This spirit lives in spirit-land on the mountains and when he visits a village he rests on the ridge of the temple. He is represented in the temple in wicker-work; there he is consulted and presents made to him.\"\n\nIn connection with this word Kanitu, or Kanida, which by the way seems to have been adopted by the missionaries as a mode of translating the word Gon, it is noticeable that the word Sinitu, meaning a malevolent spirit, is found among certain Malayan tribes, e.g., the islanders of Mantawe off the West Coast of Sumatra. See Journl. Ind. Arch., IX, 287.\n\nAs is the case with all of the larger eastern islands, the interior of New Guinea seems to be inhabited by aboriginal tribes who have been driven back to the hills by a robust race now occupying the coast districts. While the latter are described as being in places as fair as South Sea Islanders, the former are said to be black with woolly hair, beards and moustaches, and are all cannibals. The physique of the people is found to improve as one travels eastward from Port Moresby, and Dufaure island is mentioned as the point of meeting of two races\u2014one from the Kerepunu side and the other from the east. Both would seem to differ considerably from the Papuans of the Gulf. At South Cape the people are small and puny and much darker than the Eastern Polynesians.\n\nThe houses of the natives are built on piles, and in many places villages are found composed entirely of houses built in this way in shallow water on the sea-shore, communication being maintained between them by horizontal poles supported on perpendicular ones. Mr. Gill describes these as \"Swiss-lake-like villages\" in allusion, of\ncourse, to discoveries of the remains of houses raised on piles in lacustrine sites in Switzerland and North Italy.\n\nWallace long ago stated that the view of an ancient lake-dwellers village, given as the frontispiece of Sir Charles Lyell's \"Antiquity of Man,\" is chiefly founded on a sketch of a New Guinea village, viz., Dorey in the North-west of the island.*\n\nThe custom of building on piles or bamboo posts at various heights above the ground is very general from the frontiers of Tibet to the islands of the South Sea, and is one of the many points which support the theory of an identity of origin between the Indo-Chinese races and the races of the Indian Archipelago.\u2020 Specimens of Malay villages on stilts standing in the sea may be viewed any day in New Harbour, Singapore.\n\nThe customs of the people as regards clothing are not such as to encourage a hope of finding a new market for English cotton goods in New Guinea! The married men and women are described as having very little dress; the young men and girls have a little more than their parents. Shell ornaments for the hair, shell necklaces, and nose-ornaments and armlets of the same material are much worn. So are tortoise-shell ear-rings. A grass petticoat is worn by women and is said to be identical with that formerly worn in the Ellice group, the grass being ornamented by alternate red and yellow strips of pandanus leaf; married women have their heads close shaven, while unmarried girls wear their hair \"in a complete frizzle, four or five inches long and not parted.\" Young men wear a coloured band of native cloth round the stomach. It is made from the bark of the native mulberry, and is woven tightly on the body, the flesh bulging out above and below. It can be removed only by cutting it. The face is painted in stripes of black, white, red and yellow, and nasal ornaments, often nine inches long and curved, are inserted in the pierced septum. At Murray Island the old men, to conceal their grey hair, take to wigs, \"which represent them as having long, flowing, curly hair as in youth!\"\n\nTattooing is common. Women at Port Moresby are described by Mr. Gill as \"exquisitely tattooed,\" while at Hula,\n\n* Wallace's Malay Archipelago, II, 305.\n\u2020 Colonel Yule, Journ. Anthropol. Instit.\nfurther east, the tattooing is said to be \"simply perfect\" and to leave upon the mind the effect of clothing. \"Married women have a necklace or chain tattooed round the neck; each pattern has a distinct name. It is done to please the future husband, who has to pay liberally for it.\" At South Cape, says Mr. Chalmers, the women \"tattoo themselves all over their faces and bodies and make themselves look very ugly,\" shewing either an inferiority in art on the part of the South Cape people, or a diversity of taste between the two authors. Tattoo-marks on the chest and back of a chief indicate severally a life violently taken.\n\nWhen in mourning for a relative the body is blackened over and besmeared with ashes, and the chest and shoulders, and sometimes the entire person, are enveloped in fine net-work. A widow will sometimes remain in mourning for five years, during which period, it is said, she wears no ornaments and performs no ablutions. A mother in mourning for her daughter will wear round her neck all the ornaments once the property of the deceased, and along with them the jawbone taken from the unburied body. The latter incident must be looked upon, however, as a charm to avert the evil influence of the spirit of the deceased rather than any token of mourning, for in another place Mr. Chalmers describes one of his guides (at Stacy Island) as wearing, as an armlet, the jawbone of a man whom he had killed and eaten, \"while others strutted about with human bones dangling from their hair and about their necks.\" Similarly, it may be doubted if the \"immense necklace,\" seen by Mr. Gill, slung over the left shoulder of a woman (consisting of the vertebrae of her deceased brother), was really worn \"as a mark of affection,\" and the five widows of one husband who carried about, each of them, a portion of his remains, the eldest carrying the skull in a basket, were probably guided by some superstition which the European observer did not fathom.\n\nCannibalism, though not universal, is general. The Stacy Islanders boasted of having killed and eaten ten of their enemies from the mainland, and the house of the chief was hung with the skulls of the enemies eaten by himself and his people. Among these people a cannibal feast, to which\nMr. Chalmers was invited, was held and \"some of our friends appeared with pieces of human flesh dangling from their necks and arms.\" The black tribes of the interior have the reputation of being cannibals, and those with whom the Port Moresby natives trade are said to laugh at the latter for not eating such delicate food as human flesh. Instances are given too of cannibalism on the part of natives of the Hayter and Heath Islands, of Teste Island and of South Cape. At the last-named place a friendly chief presented to Mrs. Chalmers a human breast, \"a highly prized and delicate bit.\" It is not astonishing, therefore, that her husband records that after this he ceased to gratify the natives in this part of New Guinea with exhibitions of his chest, though the free inspection of the feet, boots, arms, and chest of an European seems to peculiarly delight them. \"All shout with delight, and every new arrival must have a look.\"\n\nThe gods of the natives of the south-east of New Guinea are Kaevakuku, Semese, and Tauparau, the first being a female and the others male spirits. The district of Elema is supposed to be the place of residence of these gods, and here, as well as at other places along the coast, there are temples containing idols where dances and feasts are held. No females or youths may approach the temples. Singing enters largely into the worship of these people, which would seem to be rather dictated by the fear of evil spirits than belief in beneficent ones. \"The centre post in every house is sacred to Kaevakuku and her portion of food in every feast is first offered there. The first fruits belong to her. All planting is useless unless blessed by the gods. The sun belongs to Kaevakuku. Rain, lightning and thunder to Semese and Tauparau.\" \"Kaevakuku is represented by a large frame of wicker-work. Semese and Tauparau are made from blocks of wood and stand outside of some temples, and against all the posts running down the centre.\" During a thunderstorm the natives beat drums and shout in order to drive away the storm-spirits.\n\n\"Spiritists,\" as Mr. Chalmers calls them, who profess to make revelations by the aid of spirits who speak through\nthem, after the manner of the Borneo manang and the Malay pawang, are much believed in and feared, and, like the latter, adopt a feigned voice and use much singing and chanting in their incantations. They have the reputation of being expert poisoners, and wars are undertaken and murders committed on their representations. It is no wonder that the sorcerer \u201cgets the best of everything\u2014best pig, best food, best tomahawk, best shells.\u201d There are sorceresses also. So, among the islanders of Buru, the \u201cSwangi\u201d who has a familiar spirit at his command and is able to cause sickness or disaster, receives presents, not only from those anxious to retain his goodwill, but also from those who wish to use his power to the injury of an enemy.*\n\nOf social customs, or ceremonies at births and marriages, there is no account. It would appear to be the custom for the husband to purchase his wife; one chief having stated to Mr. Chalmers that he had paid \u201can enormous sum\u201d for his consort, viz., ten arm shells, three pearl shells, two strings of dogs teeth, several hundreds of cocoa-nuts, a large quantity of yams, and two pigs. But in another district (up the William River) a man pays nothing on marriage for a girl, but has to pay heavily if the object of his choice be a widow!\n\nAccounts of burial customs vary according to the different localities and tribes visited. Of the natives of Suau, or South Cape, Mr. Gill says: \u201cAll the members of a family at death occupy the same grave (above which a small house is erected), the earth that thinly covered the last occupant being scooped out to admit the new-comer. These graves are shallow; the dead being buried in a sitting posture, hands folded. The earth is thrown in up to the mouth only. An earthen pot covers the head. After a time the pot is taken off, the perfect skull removed and cleansed\u2014eventually to be hung up in a basket or net inside the dwelling of the deceased over the fire to blacken in the smoke.\n\n* Forbes, Eastern Archipelago, 404 (Buru), 388 (Timor).\nAmong the Koiari tribe the bodies of the dead are not buried, but are dried and preserved in the following manner:\u2014\n\n\"A fire is kept burning day and night at the head and feet for months. The entire skin is removed by means of the thumb and forefinger and the juices plastered all over the face and body of the operator (parent, husband, or wife of the deceased). The fire gradually desiccates the flesh, so that little more than the skeleton is left. Their next anxiety is to discover by whose sorceries he or she has died. The mode of proceeding is as follows: the wise man of the tribe places on the body as many bits of dried grass as there are known villages round about, each bit being placed in the correct relative position. The incantation begins; at length a fly or some other insect alights on one of these straws, probably attracted by the smell. It is now evident to the wise man that an inhabitant of the village indicated by the straw occasioned the death of their friend by sorcery, for has not the god spoken? That same night revenge must be obtained! The desiccated body is well wrapped up and fixed in a lofty tree. The ashes of the two fires are rubbed over the faces of the relatives and other watchers, a grand feast and dancing concluding the whole.\" The resemblance of some of these incidents to the customs of the islanders of Buru and Timor and of the Australian aborigines is worthy of remark. Forbes has noticed that the Timorese, like the Australians, cannot understand why any one should die unless he be killed and seek, after a death, the person whose malevolent influence has caused it.\u2020 The same people suspend dead bodies, folded at the thighs and wrapped in mats, in lofty trees.\u2021\n\nIn districts where burial is practised (e.g., Port Moresby) a stake is planted beside the grave to which are tied the spear, club, bow and arrow of the deceased, (if a man),\n\n* Mr. Gill points out that D'Albertis in his work on New Guinea [vol. ii, pp. 133, 134], has furnished evidence of a similar practice obtaining among the natives of the Fly River, 500 miles further west.\n\n\u2020 Eastern Archipelago, 404, 438.\n\n\u2021 Id., p. 434.\nbroken to prevent theft: at the grave of a woman her cooking utensils, grass petticoats, &c., are similarly suspended. This is the *baiya* of the Dayaks of Borneo* and agrees, as Mr. Gill points out, with customs which prevail generally among the Polynesians. At a funeral which he witnessed, the widow sat at the head of the grave besmeared with ashes. A lament was sung by the assemblage to the accompaniment of drums which each man carried. The women scratched each others' faces and bosoms until they bled freely: \"then the hair of the dead was plucked and shaved off as charms; indescribable phallic scenes followed.\" It is the custom for relatives to watch by the graves of their deceased friends, and small huts are erected over or near the graves, in which they sleep at night.\n\nOf a tribe of mountaineers whom he visited, Mr. Chalmers says: \"the natives very seldom bury their dead, leaving the body in a house set apart for it, which they often visit. When a number of deaths take place, they leave the village and settle somewhere else not far off. There is one grave here, near to our house, on which a tobacco plant is growing, a bamboo pipe, the property of the deceased, alongside a few sticks on end with yams on top. When they do bury, the body is placed standing in the grave.\" A most cruel and unnatural custom, said to prevail in the district of Aroma, is that of burying alive decrepit parents and grandparents. A native teacher saw a man dig a grave for his aged grandmother. With his own strong arms he deposited her in it, despite her tears and feeble resistance. When remonstrated with, he replied: \"She cannot live. She is already as good as dead.\" He then filled up the grave and trod the earth down upon the living victim and went home.\n\nTaro, sago, cocoanuts, betel-nuts, yams, plantains, and sugar-cane are produced abundantly. \"Sago is cooked with shell fish, boiled with bananas, roasted on stones, baked in the ashes, tied up in leaves, &c., &c.\" Pork and the meat of the wallaby are much valued as food by the natives, and iguanas are also eaten. The indigenous breed of fowls is inferior. Cucumbers are cultivated. A small oyster, described as \"capital eating\"\n\n* See No. 14 of this Journal, p. 291.\nis plentiful at Port Moresby. The South Sea Island kava (piper methysticum) grows wild. Among the products of one district are enumerated raspberries, strawberries, nutmegs, tobacco, capsicums and indigenous cotton.\n\nMr. Chalmers gives the native names of several species of wild animals, but as he did not see them, was unable to identify them. \"The Jakoni, Gomina and Agila are very large and fierce. The Papara and Gadana are small but fierce.\" In the existence of these Mr. Gill does not appear to believe, for he says that the wild pig (sus papuensis) is the largest and, excepting the dingo, almost the only true mammal in New Guinea, all the rest being marsupials. There are two species of wallaby in New Guinea and \"two species of the hitherto strictly Australian genus Echidna, or spiny ant-eater, have been discovered,\" (Tachyglossus Brujni and T. Lawesii). Both forms are oviparous. The Echidna produces a single egg at a birth, thus supplying, as Mr. Gill remarks, the connecting link between reptiles and mammalia.\n\nMr. Gill discusses the relative advantages of three places as the capital of British New Guinea. These are Hall Sound, Port Moresby, and Kerepunn. The first is near a vast extent of fertile land, but swamps make it unhealthy; the second is shut off by hills from the interior; and the third though giving access to a valuable district is so thickly inhabited that to obtain a site would be difficult. The advantages of a safe harbour tell in favour of Port Moresby, but probably the headquarters of the High Commissioner will be the deck of his steamer for some time to come. The density of the population and the attachment of the natives to their holdings will make colonisation in New Guinea a very different undertaking to that which lay before early settlers in Australia. At South Cape Mr. Gill was told that \"every acre of soil along this part of New Guinea has its owner. A native desirous of making a plantation on another person's land can do so by asking permission, or by a stipulated payment, but only for once.\" The cultivation of jute is mentioned as an industry likely to be valuable in the future, a specimen of New Guinea jute, submitted to \"a well-known Dundee firm,\" having been pronounced to be the finest jute in the world.\nThis book contains an account of the murder of four native teachers and the wives and children of two of them in 1881, and of the murder of Dr. James and Mr. Thornegeen, with allusions to other outrages. And it is not difficult to gather from Mr. Chalmers' unvarnished narrations of his various journeys that difficulties and dangers which he successfully surmounted might, in the case of one not gifted with equal coolness and courage, have given occasion for bloodshed, and consequently for permanent hostility with a revengeful people. His knowledge and influence will, no doubt, be most useful to those charged with the administration of the Protectorate, and it is to be hoped that he may, at some future, time be able to give to the world fuller details about New Guinea than those contained in this unpretending volume, which has apparently been compiled in England, in his absence, from some of his journals and papers. Ill-digested as information communicated in this way must necessarily be, it is sufficient to enable the reader to admit, with the author of the introduction, that Mr. Chalmers has combined the qualities of missionary and explorer in a remarkable degree, and has added enormously to the stock of our geographical knowledge of New Guinea, and to our accurate acquaintance with the ways of thinking, the habits, superstitions, and mode of life of the various tribes of natives.\n\nW. E. M.\nOCCASIONAL NOTES.\n\nEXPLORATION OF PAHANG.\n\nExtract from a letter from Mr. W. Cameron to H. E. the Acting Governor (the Hon'ble Cecil C. Smith, C.M.G.) dated 4th September, 1885.\n\nI have had a very successful expedition this time, and think it is the most complete and comprehensive piece of exploring I have done yet, as well as one likely to lead to practical results.\n\nI have discovered Pahang to be a much larger territory than even I imagined, and I always knew it to be larger than was generally supposed. It impinges right up to the Ulu of the Kinta and the Raia close into Perak just as it does at Ginting Bidei, and there is no intermediate nobody's land, except that this portion is totally unknown even to the Pahangites or to any Malays. There is in this place a sort of central hill country, a sort of vortex in the mountains, where for a wide area we have gentle slopes and pamah (plateau) land, with rounded hills shut in all round by loftier ranges but which from the mean elevation of this vortex appear comparatively low, but the mean of the valley for many miles is 4,500 to 4,750 feet above sea level by aneroid. Streams of considerable size glide along easily from all around and go to feed one large stream eventually, and this is the Telom\u2014the real Ulu of the Jelei. I ascended one mountain at the N. E. corner\nof this central land and looked down on the N. E. side to the real Ulu (upper reaches) of the Kelantan, further east again behind a lofty range, Pahang, octopus-like, shoots out another arm to the north impinging on Kelantan. The mountain which I ascended was 6,300 feet by aneroid, probably considerably higher real altitude, and stands in somewhere about $4^\\circ 38'$ North Latitude 10 degrees north of east. Of this a lofty mountain range rises closing in the vortex (to continue the simile) to the East (the vortex being the Telom). This lofty range I estimated to be over 8,000 feet, perhaps considerably more. I dared not ascend it, for, not knowing what stream or system of streams I was on, I was obliged to hold on to the watershed till it brought me right into Pahang known. I had no one who could give me any information, and the Sakeis all fled before us, so that I had to be my own guide, and thus, as I say, was tied to this watershed till I could make sure what it was, as I felt certain it would settle the question of the central watershed about which there have been various conjectures, and it has solved the question, at least up to this point and a good way north of it.\n\nWe had rather a trying time of it, owing to the fearful rains. Colds, fevers and rheumatism were our constant companions, and my men suffered very much.\n\nI hope that I may have an opportunity of placing some of the results of this expedition more fully before you, and thanking you for your kind wishes.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nWILLIAM CAMERON.\n\nP.S.\u2014I was fortunate enough to obtain particularly interesting geological data, of which I have brought many specimens and made copious notes. I should have stated generally that my route was up the Raia which I explored, the Utu\n(upper reaches) being unknown, as well as the Penoh which is an anak (tributary) of the Kinta. I crossed a mountain by a pass 5,300 feet by aneroid lying exactly at the Ulu of the Kinta, Penoh and Telom. This I have called Gunho Pass. I took the elephants over with me, explored this new country and followed the Telom till I got to within a day's sail of the place where it joins the Jelei. Long ere this all our stores but rice had been exhausted, so for the purpose of obtaining supplies, and also because a rumour had got abroad in Pahang that I was a musoh (enemy) with forty elephants and four hundred men come down to harry and to raid, I had to reassure the authorities: I went down to the Tob Kayu's and to Penjum by sampan, then back again and then crossed southerly all the rivers of Upper Pahang, keeping close to the foot of the main ranges, and coming out over mountains 5,000 feet high at the Ulu of a tributary of the Slim, and thence on to Bernam.\n\nI have reason to thank the Great Master that I was enabled under his protection to bring my men back alive, although I cannot say well, for I on several occasions had great reason to be alarmed and feared some would succumb; there are several of them now under treatment, and one I left in the hospital at Penang.\n\nThe elephants, I am happy to say, notwithstanding the unprecedented fatigue, are well and in fair condition. By this time they will be pretty strong, for I left them at the Ulu of Sungkei to feed and rest eight days ago, and they will soon be in good condition. I am starting the relief party back again today by way of the Perak river and Batu Gajah and I propose taking a run down to Singapore for a day to get some outfit which cannot be procured here, when I shall do myself the honour of calling on you, but I must start my party first and I will meet them at the Bernam almost as soon as they can get there, as we are taking an additional elephant.\n\nW. C.\nLAND REGULATIONS, NORTH BORNEO.\n\nSpecial Regulations for the Leasing of Uncultivated Lands in Lots of less than 100 acres in extent.\n\nThe following Proclamation appears in the Official Gazette, North Borneo, of October 1st, 1885:\n\nWHEREAS it is expedient to repeal that portion of the Proclamation of the 23rd day of December, 1881, by which the provisions of the Labuan Land Ordinance, numbered 2 of 1863, were adopted as Law in the Territory of British North Borneo, and to make other provision in lieu thereof.\n\n1. It is hereby enacted and proclaimed that the aforesaid portion of the proclamation of the 23rd day of December, 1881, by which the provisions of the Labuan Land Ordinance, numbered 2 of 1863, were adopted as Law in the Territory of British North Borneo, shall be and is hereby repealed from the date of the coming into operation of this Proclamation, save and except as touching rights which shall have accrued, liabilities which shall have been incurred, acts which shall have been done, and all proceedings on matters which shall have taken place before this Proclamation shall come into force.\n\n2. All Government Lands under 100 acres in extent within the said territory shall be distinguished into Town Lots, Suburban Lots, and Country Lots and be disposed of in leases for the term of 999 years, unless at the time of sale of any Lot or Lots, any shorter term of lease shall have been notified in the advertisements or conditions of sale with the approval of the Governor, or if any Lot or Lots shall be disposed of under Section 5 hereof, for such term as the Commissioner of Lands, with the sanction of the Governor, shall think fit.\n\n3. Applications for lands shall be made to the Commissioner of Lands or to the duly appointed officer at out-stations, but no sale or transfer shall be valid unless approved under the hand of the Governor.\n4. Before proceeding to the disposal of any Lots within the Suburban Town or suburban boundaries, the limits of the said Lots shall be accurately defined and published.\n\n5. The said lands shall from time to time be disposed of by Mode of Sale, the Commissioner of Lands, with the sanction of the Governor, by public auction, and it shall be lawful for the Commissioner of Auction in Lands to dispose of any land which shall have been once so exposed first instance for sale without being sold, to applicants by private contract within four months from the date of such auction on terms sanctioned by the Governor.\n\n6. The Town Lots shall be subject to an annual quit-rent at the rate of one hundred and twenty dollars per acre, such quit-rents being redeemable at 15 years' purchase.\n\n7. Lands in the suburbs shall be disposed of in Lots of about one acre each, and in the country in Lots of less than 100 acres each. Such lands shall be subject to such annual quit-rent as shall be fixed by the Commissioner of Lands, with the sanction of the Governor, from time to time, and publicly notified; the said quit-rents being redeemable at 15 years' purchase.\n\n8. It shall be lawful for the Commissioner of Lands to determine at the time of sale whether any or what credit shall be allowed to the Lessees of Lots, and to regulate the terms on which money, the whole or any portion of the purchase-money paid down shall be forfeited, but in no case shall less than one-tenth of the purchase-money be paid at the time of sale.\n\n9. The payment of the quit-rent, reckoning from the date of sale, shall in every case be made in advance to the end of the payable and current year upon the execution of the lease or of the permit to occupy, and the succeeding payments shall be made on the 1st day of January in advance for each succeeding year, and any lands for which the quit-rents may be more than one year in arrear and unpaid shall revert and escheat to the Government, and all premia or other monies paid on account of such lands shall be forfeited.\n\n10. Country Lots which remain unoccupied and unimproved for three years from the date of the lease shall revert and escheat to the Government, and all premia, quit-rents, or other monies paid on account of all or any such Lots shall be forfeited.\n11. In the case of the Town Lots and Suburban Lots which shall remain unoccupied and unimproved for one year from the date of the lease, the Government shall have the option of re-entering upon and reselling the same at public auction paying to the original Lessee the whole or such portion of the premium obtained on resale as the Commissioner of Lands, with the sanction of the Government, shall think fit, not exceeding the amount of the premium originally paid to the Government for such Land, any excess being retained by the Government, but all premia, quit-rents or other monies paid on account of all or any such Lots shall be forfeited. In the case of Town Lots it is hereby enacted that any buildings erected thereon must be built in conformity with the Local Building Law for the time being in force.\n\n12. All Lots shall be surveyed and boundary stones or other land-marks be set up by the Government at the expense of the Lessees; and all boundary stones or land-marks shall be kept in repair by and at the expense of the Lessees, who, when called upon by the Commissioner of Lands, shall point out their boundaries. And no lease shall be executed or issued by the Commissioner of Lands until the whole of the premium, the quit-rent in advance for the year, and all expenses of survey, and the cost of such boundary stones or land-marks, and of setting up the same, and all fees for registration or transfer, and all expenses of conveyancing shall have been paid by the Lessees.\n\n13. Should the Lessees when duly called upon fail at any time to point out or define their boundaries, or should their definition be incorrect, it shall be lawful for the Commissioner of Lands, after one month's notice of his intention so to do has been served upon the Lessees, their Agents or Managers, or has been published in the Gazette, to survey and define the said boundaries, and to charge the Lessees with the cost of so doing not exceeding one dollar per linear chain of boundary, and to recover the same in the manner provided in section 22 of this Proclamation.\n\n14. Should it happen in case of Country Lots that immediate measurement of any land to be disposed of under the provisions of this Proclamation be found impracticable, it shall be lawful for the Governor to issue a Permit or written authority to clear and occupy such land subject to the conditions on which a regular grant would have been issued; which Permit shall specify the extent and describe as nearly as may be the relative positions of the land to which it relates; and after the measurement of the land\nso occupied, the Permit shall be called in and cancelled, and a regular grant issued in lieu thereof.\n\n15. It shall be lawful for the Commissioner of Lands, upon the application of the Lessee or other duly authorised person, to accept a surrender of any original grant of land, and to grant new leases for sub-divisions of the same, provided that all arrears of rent due under the original grant have been previously paid, and provided that in no case shall the quit-rent for any portion of a Lot so sub-divided be less than one dollar per annum.\n\n16. All coal, minerals, precious stones and mineral oil on, under and within the said lands are absolutely reserved to the Government or its Licensees, together with the right to enter upon the said lands and to search for, get and take away coal, minerals, precious stones and mineral oils in, on, or under the same, and to reserve such portions of land as may be necessary for examining or working any mines, or conveying away the products thereof, upon payment of reasonable compensation to the Lessees for surface damage to such land or any buildings thereon.\n\n17. It shall be lawful for the Governor to grant mining licenses on favourable terms to the Lessees of demised lands.\n\n18. The Government reserves the right to resume possession of such portions of land as may be necessary for public purposes, such as police, revenue and telegraph stations, roads, railways, tramways, canals, &c., upon payment of reasonable compensation for loss and damages actually sustained by the Lessee.\n\n19. The Government reserves the right at all times to take, or authorise others to take, timber, stone, clay, sand and other road-making material for the construction and repair of neighbouring roads, bridges, &c., on payment of reasonable compensation for loss and damages actually sustained by the Lessee.\n\n20. The Government reserves all navigable streams, rivers and creeks and a belt of land 50 yards wide along the banks of the same, and also a similar belt of land from high water mark along the sea-shore; ample provision, free of rent, being made for landing places and other purposes, for the convenience of the neighbouring Lessees.\n\n21. The Government reserves all edible bird's nests and guano, and also the right at all times to enter on the demised land, and to take or authorise others to take such edible birds' nests.\nand guano on payment of reasonable compensation for actual damage done to crops or roads of the Lessee.\n\nThe Lessee of any demised land shall be entitled to collect thereon all gums, gutta-percha, india-rubber, and other natural produce (save edible birds' nests and guano), paying any such Royalties in respect of the export of such produce as may for the time being be reserved to the Government, in pursuance of any regulations made or to be made by the Government. Provided that if at any time, the Lessee shall not exercise his right of collecting any kind of such produce, the Government may from time to time, serve on him a notice of its intention to collect such kind of produce, and if within a period of six months from the service of such notice the Lessee does not exercise his right, the Government or its Licensees, agents, or servants may, at any time within three months from the expiration of such period of six months, enter on any forests or uncleared or uncultivated parts of the demised land, and collect therefrom the produce referred to in the notice for the use or benefit of the Government, on payment of reasonable compensation for actual damage sustained by the Lessee.\n\n22. All arrears of payment due by any Lessee under the provisions of this Proclamation shall be recoverable by summary process in any Court of Law in the Territory of British North Borneo.\n\n23. The Regulations respecting the registration of Titles to land shall be such as shall be provided by the Law or Proclamation in force for the time being, but every Lessee shall deliver to the Commissioner of Lands a copy of every assignment or under-lease of his demised lands or any part thereof, and shall produce or cause to be produced to the Commissioner of Lands the original thereof, for the purpose of registration, and until such registration no such assignment or under-lease shall be valid.\n\n24. The fee chargeable for the registration under the provisions of this Proclamation upon the issue of a lease or a permit to occupy, is the sum of two dollars, and such registration shall be compulsory.\n\nThe expenses of survey and the cost of boundary stones or other land-marks, and the expenses of setting up boundary stones or other land-marks shall be such as shall be notified from time to time by the Commissioner of Lands, with the sanction of the Governor, by public notification.\n25. Nothing in this Proclamation provided shall be taken to affect the special conditions under which Lots of one hundred acres or upwards in extent are leased in accordance with the Special Regulations approved by the Court of Directors of The British North Borneo Company on the 7th day of February, 1883, or such other Special Regulations as may hereafter be approved by the said Court of Directors.\n\n26. All dealings in land between European and Chinese and dealing in other foreigners on the one hand, and the natives of the country land with natives on the other hand are hereby expressly forbidden, and no such dealings shall be valid or shall be recognised in any Court of Law unless such dealings shall have been entered into and concluded before the 16th day of January, 1883.\n\n27. A foreigner desirous of purchasing land from a native Foreigners shall address his application to the Governor through the Commissioner of Lands, and the Governor, if he sees fit to sanction, acquire such purchase, shall, if the native owner consent, acquire the land on behalf of the Government, and shall fix the premium at which the same shall be leased by the Government to the applicant, and the land when so leased shall thenceforward be deemed to be alienated under the provisions of this Proclamation, and shall be subject to all the provisions thereof.\n\n28. This Proclamation may be cited as \"The Land Proclamation, 1885.\"\n\n29. In the Interpretation of this Proclamation the word \"Governor\" shall mean and include the Officer administering the Government of the Territory of the time being, and the words \"Commissioner of Lands\" shall mean and include the Officer in charge of the Land Office for the time being, or his duly appointed deputies, and in Section II the term \"unoccupied and unimproved\" shall, so far as regards Town Lots, mean Lots on which tenable houses have not been erected and maintained.\n\nSandakan, 1st August, 1885.\nWith a race devoted to ancestral worship, as the Annamese are, funerals are necessarily a very solemn matter, conducted with a minute regard for traditional rites, imperative for the future welfare of the deceased. The first thing to be done is to assure one's self that the person is really dead. A film of cotton is suspended before the nostrils by a silken thread, so that the faintest breath would make it move. Death being verified, the face is covered with three sheets of paper, and over these is placed a red cloth, of silk or cotton, according to the family's wealth. One of the commonest forms of abuse in the country is to pray that your enemy may have no one at his death to perform this service for him. The object is of course to prevent evil spirits from entering and carrying off the dead man's spirit. For the same reason a constant guard is kept by the body, to prevent a cat from passing over it. Cats are particularly hateful to disembodied spirits.\n\nThree grains of rice are then put into the corpse's mouth, and if any teeth have been lost they are replaced. The old are particularly careful to preserve whatever teeth may drop out, for this purpose, and lock them up with their most valued treasures. There is a special reason for this care. Teeth are often employed for making medicines, and the sorcerers who wander about the country always have a number in their wallets, and are not at all scrupulous about how they increase the store. Instead of the three grains of rice, wealthy families sometimes put one or more precious stones in the mouth. The resemblance to the Greek obolos to pay the Stygian ferry need not be urged.\n\nThe body is then laid out, washed with water in which flowers or fragrant leaves have been boiled, the hair combed and done up in a chignon, and a black turban wound round the head. The deceased's finest clothes, very often specially prepared years before for this purpose, are put on, and he is decorated with the tokens of whatever rank he may have held. The finger nails are cut and placed in a little packet by the side of the head. If they grew into the flesh it would bring\ndisaster to the family. The corpse is then tightly bound up in cotton cerecloths, the every-day clothes being put between the limbs. Then it is ready to be put into the coffin, and care must be taken to turn the head towards the door. The shell is then closed and varnished all over to prevent the attacks of insects, particularly white ants. The varnish is black, and the best comes from Cambodian marsh lands.\n\nIn the meantime the women have been making up the mourning garments. They must be white and of linen or cotton. The nearer the relation, the coarser the material must be, and in no case are they hemmed. The Annamese Code devotes thirty pages (in Philastre's French edition) to a description of the different classes of mourning garments. It is evident, therefore, that quite enough has been said here about the matter. As soon as the mourning suits are ready the family assembles and solemnly puts them on. Then sacrifices are made to the ancestors and to the deceased, and each of the celebrants prostrates himself four times before the coffin.\n\nAccording to common Oriental custom it is usual to keep the coffin in the house for days and even weeks before burial. By its side is erected a small altar, on which are placed three cups of tea, different condiments, an incense brazier and two candles. The delay is of course to permit the assemblage of all the friends of the house, and the arrangement of one of those gorgeous funeral ceremonies which so often ruin families in the East. There is much mummery on such occasions in England, but the garish parade at a \"first-class funeral\" in Annam far exceeds any foolery we indulge in. Most of the properties are supplied by professional undertakers, and for details about them the curious may refer to the Annamese Code. Suffice it to say that there are huge lanterns of different shapes, pendant gongs to drive away evil spirits, incense tables, the red and gold painted and highly-carved bier, offering tables and a variety of banners in silk and cloth, some of them peculiar to the family, others common to ordinary, vulgar humanity, such as the fillet borne on two poles, which is inscribed Trung-tin (faithful) for a man, and Trinh-thuan (pure and obedient) for a woman.\n\nThe time for the interment is of course fixed by the wise\nmen, who select a lucky day and hour; at the head march men with wands to scare off prowling devils. Then in the midst of some of the objects mentioned above comes the \"dead man's house,\" a sort of bamboo cage. The children and the nearest relations follow the bier. In passing the threshold of the door the coffin has been carried over their prostrate bodies. In the middle march a body of monks chanting a noisy but rhythmical requiem. Sham gold and silver leaf is scattered all along the road to soothe the Co-hon\u2014the abandoned spirits. These are the souls of people who have died violent deaths, and have had no rites of sepulture. Their relations have not known of their fate, and have been unable or unwilling to perform the ceremonies which custom prescribes for the delivery of their souls. Therefore the Co-non remain wanderers on the face of the earth, irritated with the living, and tormenting and oppressing them in every way. They trouble the sacrifices, upset the prognostics, and annihilate the efforts of domestic piety. The superstitious, therefore, are driven to all sorts of devices to appease and deceive these evil-minded demons. The Co-hon are attracted by the glitter of the false gold and silver leaf, halt to lay hands on it, and, before they discover the deception, have lost the opportunity of spoiling the funeral ceremony.\n\nThere are others, however, who are more considerate, or more fearful of the wrath of these homeless spirits. They burn regular Nh\u1eeft-nh\u1eeft-dong-dong\u2014\"numerous pieces of money.\" These are strips of paper with coins printed on them, regular postal orders on the lower world for the support of indigent devils. Naturally the funerals so protected are the safer for the deceased.\n\nThere are no public cemeteries in Annam. The grave is usually dug anywhere out in the middle of the fields belonging to the family. The rich usually have a special place for their own relations, and sometimes assign a patch for their poorer neighbours. Otherwise these must be buried by the roadside or in some part of the village common lands. At the grave the coffin is lowered in, a banneret of silk or paper giving in white and yellow characters deceased's name, age, dignities, position in family, and virtues, is thrown upon it, and then a small pile of the above-mentioned money paper. Each friend\nthrows in a handful of earth. The sextons fill it up and make a circular mound above. Offerings and prostrations are made before the completed grave, and then there is a general consumption of rice, wine, and betel-nut.\n\nThe period of mourning is very protracted. Nominally it lasts for three years for father or mother, but immemorial custom decrees that this means twenty-four months. For a grandparent or brother or sister it lasts one year, and so on in decreasing ratio. Men of rank cannot undertake public duties during this season, and ought not to be present at marriages or feasts of any kind. The son should eat no meat and drink no wine. The people are very proud of these regulations, but they do not keep them. At the end of the first year there are great sacrifices before the grave; at the end of the second the \"dead man's house,\" the bamboo cage, is burnt, and with it the mourning garments. Desecration of the grave is punished with extreme severity.\n\nThe richer people erect stone monuments over their ancestors. The plain between Saigon and Cholon, the Plaine des Tombeaux, is full of these, of all sizes and in all states of decay, sometimes standing quite alone, sometimes with shrubs and then trees planted by them. There are inscriptions on most of them, usually cut into the stone and painted various colours. They bear the family and individual name and those of the deceased's titles and place of birth, the date of death, and the name of the person who set up the stone. Some of them are almost miniature temples. They are kept up by the head of the house, and there are regularly fixed days for worship before them.\n\nThis is in fact the only worship the Annamese have, but some of them carry it on with tolerable regularity. The first and the fifteenth of every month are the regular days set apart for worship at the ancestral shrine. At the same time there is always more or less something to the Co-hon already spoken of. Nothing is deemed too great to soften their rancour. Besides the silver and gold paper and the \"cash notes\" above alluded to, there is a much more valuable paper currency. These are sheets of paper covered all over with designs and\nwritten characters; at the top there is a bell with a tongue to it to attract the Co-hon. On either side are invocations to the Buddhas, the good genii, and the priests, preceded occasionally by the well-known formula Nam-mo A-di-va Phat.\n\nBelow are representations of fine clothes, different domestic utensils, embroidered robes with Phat inscribed on them, mandarins' boots, strings of different kinds of money with Thai-Binh (eternal peace) on them, and a variety of other combinations\u2014everything, in fact, that an indigent devil could require. The invocations at the top vary. In some of them they run, \"Oh, all ye Phat (Buddhas) who live for aye in the ten places. List, ye spirits, all-powerful.\" Or again, \"Hearken, all ye saints, all-blessed, all-powerful, ye who are like unto fire pure and undefiled, grant, in your mercy, to forsaken spirits who have suffered from the three evils, entrance into the divine abode.\"\n\nOn the first and fifteenth of the month such papers of supplies, pecuniary and personal, are burnt not only at the ancestral altars and on the threshold of the houses, but upon special altars erected in lonely places to the Co-hon. While the papers are burning, the head of the family prostrates himself, and afterwards scatters broadcast on the roof of his cottage somewhat more substantial, but still scanty, offerings of rice and bananas. These are of course to prevent the Co-hon from coming inside, an occurrence which the most hospitable goodman would view with horror.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the first, seventh, and tenth months, more particularly of the seventh, there are almost universal offerings to these troublesome Co-hon. They are called Le Phat-Luong\u2014distributions of food.\n\nIt is curious to watch the people come out of their houses just after dark. The father of the house calls out, \"Spirit who hast a name, but no title; spirits who have titles but no human name; spirits of universal nature, crowd hither and eat my offering.\"\n\nThen he turns to the four points of the compass, one after the other, commencing with the west, throws towards each of them a handful of salt and rice mixed, and burns a little of\nthe spirit-money, saying, \"I call the laggard spirits; he who comes fastest will eat most. May ten become a hundred; may a hundred become a thousand; a thousand, ten thousand; ten thousand, a hundred thousand; a hundred thousand, a million; a million, a countless multitude.\" This is, it need hardly be explained, a desire to obtain the multiplication of his offering. The notion is of course borrowed from the Chinese with their regular sacrifices of Dien. A development of this, found in all parts of the world among uncivilised nations, is the exorcism of evil spirits which are supposed to enter into people and cause illnesses. The method of driving these out in Annam differs little from the process described by dozens of writers on nations in other parts of the earth. The sorcerer is called Thai-Phap, and he must on no account eat the flesh of buffaloes or dogs.\n\nAn analogous superstition is the ceremony of making offerings once every year to the former holders of the soil. No country farmer would think of letting the first three months of the year pass without making offerings of a general kind to the old aboriginal cultivators. Sometimes, however, this is not enough. He loses his dogs and pigs and chickens, his rice gets drowned with too much water or dies of drought; he falls sick himself and sees visions of capering, bloodthirsty savages.\n\nThen he knows what is the matter, and goes straight off to a paper-goods manufacturer and orders a facsimile of his house to be built in paper. This is a most elaborate affair, reproducing not only a general model of the house, but of everything in it\u2014furniture, people, dogs, cats, and pigs, and even the lizards in the thatch. All the human beings, however, are represented twice over, so that the ghost to whom this model is to be given up may not have an exact model of the owner, or of his wife or children. These houses are very dear, costing sometimes as much as \u00a36, which is a large sum for a peasant farmer. If it is the commune that is making the offering, a model is made of the village shrine, the Dinh.\n\nOn the determined day, offerings of the usual kind are made, and the wizard, the Thai-Phap, falls into a trance, and is possessed by the deceased owner of the land. He blackens\nhis face on the bottom of a pot, eats ducks and chickens raw, and drinks wine by the bucketful. This is proof positive that the old savage owner is inside of him and is having a real good time. Then he is requested to make a formal cession of the land in question. If the farmer is a rich man the spirit does not yield for several days, if he is poor it is settled as soon as possible. A sum is fixed upon, a few hundred ligatures say, and this is promptly paid, in funeral money of course, which can be bought for a shilling or two. The possessed Thai-Phar signs for the departed savage, planting a thumb dipped in ink at the bottom of the written conveyance. Then the medium is restored from his mesmerised state, the paper house is burnt, and with it the sum of money formally agreed upon. It is usually also stipulated that a pig shall be sacrificed every three years or oftener for the better comfort of the old land-owner. After this it is hard if the farmer does not enjoy peace o' nights.\n\nThe household ancestry, as we have said, are worshipped more or less all the year round; but the especial great season for every one, rich and poor, is the new year, the T\u00eer, the Annamese new year of course, which corresponds with the Chinese, and falls about the beginning of February. Then every one, down to the poorest, who at other times may not have the means or the leisure to pay proper attention to their forefathers, betakes himself to the last resting-place of his progenitors, and there is much burning of incense and funeral money, much scattering of rice and heaping up of fruit and flowers, during four days. The grass and other vegetable growths round about the tombs are carefully weeded away, and at the head of each a leaf of gold or silver is placed, and on this a stone to prevent it from being carried off by the wind. The belief is that, at a season such as the T\u00eer, the evil spirits are particularly active and spiteful on account of the general rejoicing and feasting which they see going on upon earth. They are therefore exceptionally likely to do harm to ordinary, easy-going souls, such as those of the rude forefathers of the hamlet. But their cupidity thwarts them. They clutch at the glittering leaf placed at the grave-head, and, while they are doing so, the respectable spirit down below has time to scurry off to a place of safety. The Plaine des Tombeaux at\nSaigon presents an extraordinary appearance at this season of the year. Ordinarily it is as desolate, if not as big, as the similar place at Cairo; but during the four days of the Tet both sides of the Tay-Ninh road are crowded with pious descendants from all parts of the country, come to secure the tranquillity of their ancestry.\u2014France and Tongking, by James G. Scott, 1885.\n\nThe scientific decoration of officier d'Acad\u00e9mie (les palmes acad\u00e9miques) has been conferred by the French Government upon Madame de la Croix, whose husband M. J.

F. Dickson, c.m.g., The Hon'ble W. E. Maxwell, c.m.g., W. A. Pickering, Esq., c.m.g., and Messrs. A. Knight, R. W. Hullett, H. L. Noronha, C. Dunlop, J. Miller, E. Koek, G. Copley, C. B. Buckley, and W. A. Bicknell.\n\nThe Vice-President (Mr. Pickering) took the Chair.\n\nThe Honorary Secretary (Mr. W. E. Maxwell) stated that the business before the meeting was to receive the Annual Report of the Council and the Honorary Treasurer's accounts, and to elect officers for the year to replace the out-going Council, and to elect two new members.\nThe Report of the Council for the year 1885 (vide page xv) was read.\n\nThe Honorary Treasurer submitted his accounts for 1885 (vide page xviii), which were passed.\n\nThe Honorary Secretary stated that he had, at the request of the last meeting of the Council of the Society, written to Government asking whether the Society would have accommodation in the new Museum when the building was completed; and the reply was that the Asiatic Society would be accommodated in the Reference Library; and the Room was marked off on the plan (laid on the table for the information of members) as the \"Reference Library and Asiatic Society's Library.\" This would be a great advantage to the Society, and their warmest thanks were due to the Government.\n\nWith regard to the two volumes of \"Miscellaneous Papers relating to Indo-China and the Malay Peninsula,\" shortly to be published for the Society by Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner & Co., and referred to in the Report, the sheets received up to date were laid on the table, and it was stated that the publication would be uniform, in general get-up, binding and finish, with Tr\u00fcbner's \"Oriental Series,\" specimens of which were exhibited.\n\nThe following new members were unanimously elected:\n\nProposed by Mr. E. Abrahamson, seconded by Mr. S. E. Dalrymple.\u2014Capt. R. D. Beeston.\n\nProposed by the Hon'ble J. F. Dickson, seconded by the Hon'ble W. E. Maxwell,\u2014the Hon'ble J. W. Bonser.\n\nThe next business being to elect officers for the year to replace the out-going officers,\n\nThe Honorary Secretary said the Society had generally had as its President the Colonial Secretary, but they had never had a Colonial Secretary who had performed any special scientific or literary work for the Society, though all had been willing to further its objects in every way. But to the new Colonial Secretary (the Hon'ble J. F. Dickson, c.m.o.) he hoped that the Society might look confidently not only for the moral support which they had received\nfrom former Colonial Secretaries, but (judging from the cordial support which in Ceylon he had given to Oriental research and the active part he had taken in the work of the Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society there) for active co-operation in the work of the Society. He had now the honour to propose him as President for the year.\n\nThe election by ballot was then proceeded with, with the following result:\n\nPresident, ... ... ... The Hon'ble J. F. Dickson, c.m.g.\nVice-President, Singapore, ... W. A. Pickering, Esquire, c.m.g.\nVice-President, Penang, ... D. Logan, Esquire.\nHonorary Secretary, ... The Hon'ble W. E. Maxwell, c.m.g.\nHonorary Treasurer, ... E. Koek, Esquire.\n\nCouncillors, ... ... ...\n\nA. Knight, Esquire.\nDr. N. B. Denys.\nH. L. Noronha, Esquire.\nR. W. Hullett, Esquire.\nJ. Miller, Esquire.\n\nThe President said he was very much obliged to the gentlemen present for the honour they had done him in electing him. He would have been very glad if they had elected one who had distinguished himself by good services to the Society, but as they had chosen to adhere to the rule of having the Colonial Secretary as President, he would only say that his services would be always willingly placed at their disposal, and he would be glad if in any way he could assist in furthering its ends. His Oriental studies, which Mr. Maxwell had too kindly alluded to, had been in a direction which he feared could not be taken as leading to results which would recommend themselves as interesting to a Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society situated in Singapore. They had been mainly confined to a study of the Buddhist scriptures in the original Pali with a view to arriving at, and properly understanding, the origin and the pure principles of Buddhism; but with the help of the older members of the Singapore Branch he hoped to\ntake an active interest in the subjects which came before them from time to time, and as he came to a more perfect understanding of them, to take part in the consideration of the same and of such matters of research as might be connected with them. (Applause.)\n\nThe meeting closed with a vote of thanks to Mr. Pickering, the Singapore Vice-President.\nANNUAL REPORT\nOF THE\nCOUNCIL\nOF THE\nSTRAITS BRANCH\nOF THE\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY,\nFOR THE YEAR 1885.\n\nThe Council for 1885, on retiring, have, they believe, a satisfactory Report to lay before the Society.\n\nDuring the year, the following new members have been elected provisionally by the Council, subject to confirmation at a general meeting:\u2014the Hon'ble J. F. Dickson, C.M.G., J. B. Elcum, Esq., A. Hale, Esq., Dr. Duncan Scott, H. Clifford, Esq., A. Gentle, Esq., T. L. Gosling, Esq.\n\nThe following member has been removed by death during the year 1885\u2014Sir Harry St. George Ord.\n\nThe Council are glad to announce the completion and approaching publication of two volumes of Miscellaneous Papers relating to Indo-China and the Malay Peninsula, which have been edited for the Society by Dr. Rost, and which are published by Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner & Co. The collection includes forty papers of various degrees of scientific interest, extracted from Dalrymple's Repertory, Asiatic Researches, and the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. A supply of copies of this work will be sent to the Honorary Secretary as soon as it is published, and may be obtained from him, by members only, at $5 for the two volumes. It is proposed to continue the series by the publication of two more volumes in 1886,\nand it is hoped in this manner to collect, in a convenient form for reference, much valuable scientific information relating to the Eastern Archipelago.\n\nThe Council have pleasure in acknowledging the liberality of the Government of this Colony, from whom the promise of a grant of $500 towards the proposed publication has been received.\n\nIn connection with this subject, the Council desire to suggest an undertaking which might, in their opinion, well engage the attentive consideration of the Government and of this Society at some future time. The Colony has no authorised Statistical Gazetteer, to which residents, students, travellers and men of science may turn for authentic information regarding the Straits Settlements and the Native States of the Peninsula. Such a work should embody a full account of these regions, their inhabitants and productions, in the departments of Geography, Geology, Ethnology, Religion, Manners and Customs, History, Arts, Manufactures, Agriculture, Commerce, Zoology, Ornithology, Ichthyology, &c., and should give a concise account of every town and village of importance within the limits referred to. It would carry on, in the Far East, the work already performed in British India and Burma.\n\nIn the department of Geography, the Society has not been idle. Recent explorations in Pahang and the work of surveyors in the service of the Native States have added greatly to our geographical knowledge during the last few years; and it has been found possible to make great improvements in the map of the Peninsula which was published by Mr. Stanford for the Society in 1879. An entirely new map is now in course of preparation, and will be sent to England for publication in 1886.\n\nWhile acknowledging with thanks the kindness of the Singapore Exchange, who have so often permitted the Society the use of their rooms, it is gratifying to be able to announce that the Society will, before long, have a suitable room for its meetings. The Government have set apart a large room in the new Museum for a Reference Library, and the Society will be domiciled there.\nOne of the members of the Society resident in Singapore, Mr. G. Copley, has obligingly taken over charge of the books and papers presented from time to time to the Society, and has undertaken to have them bound, labelled and catalogued.\n\nThe publication of a paper devoted to \"Notes and Queries\" which was proposed in the last Annual Report, has been carried out; and two numbers have appeared. The Council hope that, as this publication becomes better known, the number of contributors and correspondents will increase.\n\nNumbers 14 and 15 of the Journal of the Society were published during the year. They contained the following papers:\n\n\"Ascent of Gunong Bubu,\" by Rev. J. Tenison-Woods.\n\"Sea-Dyak Religion,\" by Rev. J. Perham.\n\"History of Perak from Native Sources,\" by W. E.

W. KOEK.\nPLAN FOR A VOLUNTEER POLICE IN THE MUDA DISTRICTS,\nPROVINCE WELLESLEY, SUBMITTED TO GOVERNMENT\nBY THE LATE J. R. LOGAN IN 1867.\n\nThe districts of North Province Wellesley lying along the Muda and the Kreh, comprising the lands held by me and the tracts surrounded by or adjacent to those held by Malays, are without Police stations, and, for the most part, without roads. Over a large portion of this area the population is scattered in small hamlets far apart from each other. The unreclaimed state of the greater part of it affords facilities for gangs of robbers lurking, and they can enter it by stealth either from the Muda or from the sparsely inhabited country beyond our eastern frontier. Crimes are frequently committed within it, and the perpetrators are hardly ever brought to punishment. A few years ago one of the noted panglima panyamun, or robber captains, of Kedah crossed it repeatedly in open day at the head of a gang well armed, and the Penghulu took care, while affecting pursuit, to keep at a safe distance from him.\n\nUnless Chinese can be induced to settle in these districts, the work of reclamation will be exceedingly slow. I give them all the encouragement I can, but, in the absence of regular Police, or a good system of volunteer police, they have no protection for their lives and property, and are constantly exposed to thefts and often to robbery and murder. A goldsmith opened a shop on the Ikan Mati Road, but was robbed, and the lives of himself and his workmen endangered. He drew back and established himself close to my house at Permatang Bertam. A shopkeeper settled at Paya Kladi fortified his house by rows of posts all round it, and thick bars to his door. Within two months he was attacked at night by a party of Malays. He and his men defended themselves by throwing billets of fire-wood and crockery from an upper window.\nat the assailants, and the latter, unable to force an entry, set fire to the house and burned it down, the Chinese escaping behind by making a rush, headed by their buffaloes. Lately, within about one month, three serious crimes were committed on my land towards the boundary pillar. Some Chinese, who had opened a shop on the bank of the river at one of the landing places, were robbed and two of them murdered in a cruel manner by a gang of Malays soon after nightfall. A Chinese hawker, belonging to another shop, was murdered during the day, for some dried fish and other articles of trifling value which he was carrying. When I last visited this district on the 11th instant, I found that one of my Malay tenants had had his house burned down in the previous night. Whilst he was asleep someone had first planted bamboo spikes along the path leading to the house to lame the inmate in escaping, or his neighbours should they come to his assistance, and had then set fire to it.\n\nThe Chinese shopkeepers have lately been disarmed by the Police, although they remained quiet, attending to their own business, during the recent disturbances in Penang, and they are now entirely at the mercy of the bad class of the Malays.\n\nThe Malays, although in most places sufficiently numerous to defend themselves from gang robbers, are unable to do so from want of concert and guidance. When a house is attacked, the neighbours usually remain aloof, partly in the fear that from want of sufficient support they may be wounded or killed by the robbers, and partly in the fear that if seen with them they may be suspected of being confederates. The robbers have, in almost all cases, fire-arms, which very few of the Malays possess; their attacks are sudden, they discharge muskets and use savage threats, and they are led, or believed to be led, by Panglimas, of whom the villagers stand in great dread, as many of them are noted for their boldness, strength, dexterity and ferocity, and boast of, and are credited with, being invulnerable. Hence it happens that at present a gang of ten or twenty robbers may march through the most populous villages, plunder houses and retire with complete impunity.\n\nThe Malays of Kedah, including those of the boats and rafts on the river, all carry arms. If our Malays are entirely disarmed they will be more exposed than ever to visits of marauders from beyond the frontiers.\n\nMost of the so-called Penghulu have been appointed by the Penghulu Besar, or Police Inspectors, without authority from Government. Some are men qualified by position and character for the post, others are of bad reputation, or unable to write, or other-\nwise disqualified. They have no systematic arrangements among themselves and with the villagers for united action in emergencies.\n\nThe effect of this was seen during the recent disturbances in town, when a requisition by the Lieutenant-Governor to the Deputy Commissioner of Police to send 300 Malays to town under the command of one of the Punggulu Besar and to hold other 300 in readiness at the coast villages under the other Punggulu Besar was answered by only about 120 being sent over without the Punggulu Besar, but with so many Punggulu Mukims that among the men from my neighbourhood there was a Punggulu for every seven, while some Pungguluses had only one or two followers. The Punggulu Mukims should have been left, as was intended, in their villages to watch them and send in moro men to the Punggulu Besar. The Malays were everywhere, so far as I went among them, willing and ready to obey the order of Government, but they were kept back, as they alleged, by orders from the local heads of the paid Police, the Punggulu Besar, who seem to have considered it necessary to keep some 10,000 male adults at their homes, or marching in bands up and down the country, to look after a few hundred Macao coolies.\n\nThe Malays on my lands are bound by an article in their leases \"to conform to such regulations as the landlord may, from time to time, make, in aid of the observance and enforcement of the law and for sanitary purposes within the limits of the estate.\" Those men and the Malays of the villages and kampongs adjoining have asked me to arrange with them a plan for their protection against gang robbers and for their more systematic action on the occurrence of disturbances among the Chinese, but I do not think that any such plan could be efficiently carried out without the sanction of Government. If it should be thought that my knowledge of the inhabitants and constant visits to different parts of the districts along the Muda and the Kreh, would be useful in introducing and bringing into working order such a plan, my services are entirely at the disposal of the Lieutenant-Governor.\n\nI would suggest the following:\n\nPlan for the Police Protection of the Muda Districts.\n\nThe experiment of a Volunteer Police to be tried in the Districts along the Muda and the Kreh, which are at present without Police and are with difficulty accessible by the Police from their distance from Police Stations and want of roads.\nThe experiment to be made gradually and cautiously, beginning with the inland districts, where the societies have no branches or influence, selecting the best men to work it, engaging the villagers heartily in it, and imparting to them, and especially to the headmen, some knowledge of their legal obligations in cases of gang robberies and other crimes attended with violence.\n\nThe plan, if successful, could be afterwards extended to other districts, so as to keep down the cost of the paid Police, which already presses heavily on the rate-payers and affords them little protection from ordinary crimes and none from extraordinary ones, such as gang robberies, persecutions by Malay societies and disturbances of the peace caused by the dissensions of Chinese and Malay Societies.\n\nThe Malay Penghulus to be directly responsible to the Lieutenant-Governor and his Assistant in the Province and not to the Deputy Commissioner of Police, although they will act in aid of the Police. They will maintain a direct communication, as it were, between Government and the population, and be highly useful in influencing and informing the villagers in accordance with the policy of Government. For example, the Lieutenant-Governor might explain to them the mischief done by the societies and engage them to discountenance them.\n\nThe system should be totally disconnected with the mukims (parishes), mosques and jumahas, and the Penghulus of mukims or mosques should not be employed as Penghulus. There would otherwise be danger of the jumahas and their heads acquiring too much influence and too powerful an organization. The jumahas bring a strong social pressure to bear on the villagers in the interest of a stricter and more fanatical observance of Mahomedanism and a greater submission to their religious leaders.\n\nThe two paid Police Inspectors who now have the title of Penghulu Besar should be called Inspectors if retained, so as to confine the title of Penghulu to the village headmen.\n\n1. The larger villages to be divided into kampongs of 20 to 30 houses each.\n\n2. Each of these kampongs, and every hamlet or group of houses apart from the villages to have a Katua Besar, Katua Kechil and Kuceang (messenger).\n\n3. Such a proportion of the adult males as Government thinks fit (or the whole in particular kampongs) to be enrolled as a volunteer police.\n\n4. A certain number of these to be detailed, every three months, in each kampung to turn out with the Katua Besar when required,\nthe others to guard the kampong on such occasions under the Katua Kechil.\n\n5. Groups of adjacent kampongs to form Dairahs under a Penghulu Besar and Penghulu Muda with their Kweangs.\n\n6. The Penghulus and Katuas to be furnished with muskets, swords and other arms by Government, and the Penghulus to be licensed to carry swords when they are abroad.\n\n7. The enrolled villagers to be licensed to keep such arms as may be sanctioned, and to carry them when on service.\n\n8. The Penghulus to be appointed Constables.\n\n9. Every Penghulu to be furnished with a gong and every Katua and Kweang with a wooden tong-tong such as is used by the Police in Java, and a system of alarm signals with these to be prescribed.\n\n10. The Penghulus to receive written appointments under the seal of the Lieutenant-Governor. The Katuas to be annually elected by the enrolled villagers, subject to the confirmation of the Lieutenant-Governor.\n\n11. When gangs of robbers or other disturbers of the peace are abroad, the nearest Penghulus or Katuas to beat a rapid alarm signal, which will be repeated by the adjacent Penghulus and Katuas and stop as soon as it is so repeated. The presence of the robbers, rioters, &c., in or near any kampong to be indicated by slow beats continued till they have left, and their vicinity to another kampong is signalled in the same way. When the signal is heard every Penghulu and every Katua Besar with his men to run to the place where the robbers are. The Katua who is first on the spot to take the general direction of the volunteers until the arrival of the Penghulu of the Dairah, who is to take the command of the \"Hue and Cry\" and retain it, unless it is assumed by a Magistrate, Justice of the Peace, Deputy Commissioner, or Inspector of Police.\n\n12. The ordinary duties of the Penghulus will be to receive from, and furnish to, adjacent Penghulus and Police Stations notices of movements of robbers and noted or suspected criminals, to prevent crimes, arrest criminals, &c. They might also have other useful duties assigned to them, such as keeping a registry of the inhabitants, births, deaths, marriages, divorces, &c.\n\n13. The Penghulus, Katuas and Kweangs to be exempted from rates. If the system be found to work well, the Penghulus might receive a small salary.\n\n14. Cattle stealing, now so common, to be checked by a system of passes.\n\n15. Persons not to be allowed to cross or descend the Muda at night without passes from a Penghulu.\nFor the more effectual police of the Muda and protection of our districts adjoining it, it is desirable that arrangements should be come to with the Raja of Kedah with respect to passes for men and cattle; the arrest and detention by his Penghulus of persons charged by any of our Penghulus or Police Officers with a crime committed in our territories when the charge is verified on oath, or a warrant by a Magistrate or Justice of the Peace to arrest such persons is produced; the taking up the Hue and Cry when gangs of robbers escape from the Province across the frontier. Information as to apprehended crimes, movements of robbers, &c., should be communicated by the Penghulus on the one side of the river to the Penghulus on the other side. And the Penghulu Besar at Kota, who is the Superintendent of the districts on the Kedah side of the river and a Magistrate or a Justice of the Peace on our side should form a standing international Commission for the better preservation of the peace on the river and its borders, the regulation of ferries, the prevention of the passage of criminals and stolen property, the arrest of fugitive criminals, the prevention of smuggling, cattle trespasses, &c.\n\nThe Raja, it is also suggested, should be asked to empower the Penghulu Besar or a Hakim at Kota to hold a Court for the recovery of debts by creditors on our side from persons who have fled to, or reside on, the Raja's side.\n\nJ. R. LOGAN.\n\n20th August, 1867.\n\nI see no objection to the carrying out of Mr. Logan's project in part, leaving the rest for future and more mature consideration. Penghulus, willing to act without salary, might be appointed along the line of the Muda, who might be permitted to carry arms. The Government have none to supply, not having sufficient for the Police. They might be permitted to recommend and appoint, under section 21 of the Police Act, a certain number of men to act as Special Constables, also to be permitted to carry arms, and the Penghulus themselves might be appointed under the same Act, the Commissioner of Police having only such authority over them as he should receive from the Lieut.-Governor. Then, people might be appointed on the application of Mr. Logan as required by the Act, and a system of communicating by means of gongs, or otherwise, might very well be adopted for mutual information and protection. I quite agree with Mr. Logan, and had already\nadopted his opinion, that the paid P\u0113ngh\u016blus should be in the position of the Parish Constable in England. If Mr. Logan approves of this, perhaps he will name the P\u0113ngh\u016blus to be appointed.\n\nA. E. H. ANSON,\nLieut.-Governor.\n\nLieut.-Governor's Office,\n30th August, 1867.\n\nTo Percy Windsor Earl, Esq.,\nCommissioner of Police,\nPrince of Wales' Island.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour, on behalf of the inhabitants of Muda District liable to be called out as part of the Posse Comitatus and who have signed agreements to act in keeping the peace and in aid of the Police, to request that you will be good enough to appoint the persons whom they have elected for that purpose, and whose names are entered in the Rolls now sent for your inspection, Constables under Section 21 of the Police Act of 1856, to keep the peace within their respective Dairahs and K\u0101mponges, from this date till the end of next year; to which I beg leave to add my own request.\n\nIn the event of the peace being disturbed by gang-robbers or others, the villagers will be called out by these Constables and act under their directions until an officer of Police, or other person having lawful authority in that behalf, arrives at the place of the disturbance and takes the direction.\n\nThe Constables have also undertaken to give immediate information to the nearest Police authority of all crimes or intended crimes that come to their knowledge, and to attend, with as many of the villagers as may be required, whenever their aid is called for by any officer of Police.\n\nThe Constables will serve without pay, but it is hoped that, in consideration of the saving of expense which such a system of supplementary Volunteer Police may enable Government to effect in the regular Police force, the Municipal Commissioners will think it proper to remit some portion of their rates. At present, as you are aware, a large portion of the District is without Police Stations and roads. Without an organization of this kind, the villagers are defenceless against gang robbers, and this is true\neven of those portions that are in the vicinity of Police Stations, for it cannot be expected that half a dozen Policemen can beat off or arrest armed bands of 20 to 70 men unless they are aided by the Hue and Cry, which has been proved by the recent gang robberies in the south of the Province as well as by many in former years in the north, to be wholly ineffective when the Posse Comitatus is not thus organized. The mere knowledge that the villagers are everywhere prepared to resist gang robberies will, it may be anticipated, have the effect of making them less frequent. I intended to arrange with the Muda villagers a system of signals by beat of wooden drums such as are used by the Police of Java, but I think it would be better if you were to introduce such a system for general adoption both by the regular and the Volunteer Police.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nProvince Wellesley, Your most obdt. servant,\n15th October, 1867. J. R. LOGAN.\n\nTo\n\nThe Hon'ble Colonel Anson,\nLieut.-Governor,\nP. W. Island.\n\nSir,\n\n1. Referring to the Memo. which I submitted to you on 20th August last on the subject of the organization of the Malay villagers of the Muda and Kreh districts, under headmen, for their mutual protection against gang robbers and other purposes, and to your Memo. thereon, dated 30th August, approving of the experiment and requesting that I would name the Penghulus to be appointed, I have now the honour to forward lists of Penghulus and rolls of the volunteers. Acting on your suggestion, the Penghulus and Katunas have been appointed \"additional constables\" under Section 21 of the Police Act of 1856 on a formal application made by the villagers and myself to the Commissioner of Police.\n\n2. Instead of selecting the headmen myself, I thought the better course, for reasons which I shall presently give, would be to visit the different villages, talk over the matter with the Malays, arrange with them the most convenient division of the groups of population into Kampongs or villages and of these into Dairahs or districts, and then leave it to the villagers to name\ntheir Katuas,* or elders, and the latter to name the Penghulus,\u2020 or heads, for submission to you.\u2021 With your approval, I also adopted a form of agreement which is printed in English and Malay at the head of the Rolls, by which the signers agree to aid in keeping the peace, and not to join unlawful societies. Opposite the name of each is a list of the arms kept by him, and for which licenses are requested.\n\n3. It has necessarily taken some time to get the plan carried out thus far amongst so scattered a population. Almost universally it has been received with the greatest favour. In some of the villages towards the west, where there is a Jawi-pakan admixture and where the influence of two of the town jumahas and one of the Province ones was recently great, hesitation was shewn by individuals, who asked if Government, after doubling and trebling the assessed rates on the lands and rating their houses, might not intend to put on new taxes, or make the volunteers keep up the roads and drains, or serve as soldiers? I explained to them that the Municipal Commissioners had simply directed re-assessment at the true or improved valuation, that the proposed system was a purely voluntary one originating with myself and heartily taken up by the Malays in my quarter as the surest means for our mutual protection, but that the Lieutenant-Governor had approved of it, would grant written appointments to the Penghulus and Katuas, and would, I hoped, give it every encouragement if it worked well. In some instances difficulties have arisen from a difference of opinion in the choice of heads, or from bold and crafty men, of whom their more ignorant and timid neighbours stand in some fear, maneuvering to be named as Penghulus, but by a little patience and management these difficulties have been overcome.\n\n4. I consider it essential to the success of the plan, and as constituting its distinctive feature, that the village heads as well as those of divisions should owe their position and their retention of it, to the opinion in which they are held by their fellow-villagers. In most cases, the appointment would practically be permanent, but to keep the heads on their good behaviour the villagers should have the option of changing them at intervals, and three years appears to be a suitable term.\u00a7 Among such a\n\n* Katua from tua, old; Penghulu from \u00falu, the native Malay name for head, now replaced by the Sanskrit kapala.\n\n\u2020 The Kireungs are accredited messengers of the Katuas and Penghulus named by them with the approval of the villagers.\n\n\u2021 One year, formerly proposed by me, is, I find, too short a term to render the office acceptable to the Malays and give them a proper training.\ngular Police, having, or credited with having, the ear of the Euro-\npean Authorities, and allowing them, at the same time, to assume\nthe position of chiefs of large districts. In a small village the\ninhabitants are intimately known to each other and often more or\nless connected by marriage. They are usually on nearly the same\nsocial level, and almost every head of a family is a substantial\nyeoman who ploughs his own acres. A village Penghulu will sel-\ndom try, or be allowed, to dominate over a score or two of fellow-\nvillagers as a district Penghulu can over some thousands of the more\nignorant Malays, whose faith in his pretensions is in inverse pro-\nportion to their personal familiarity with him. Of course there is\na counterbalancing risk of the village Penghulu being sometimes\nfound not sufficiently independent of the influence of his relatives\nand associates, if any of them should happen to be guilty of a crime,\nbut this is a minor risk to that of the wide reaching oppressions\nand denials of justice which attend the rule of a pleasant manner-\ned District Penghulu who happens to be greedy of money. I\nregard the Divisional Penghulus in my own plan with some distrust,\nand would prefer to be able to dispense with them for the present.\nIt will be seen that I have made some changes since the Rolls were\nsigned by breaking up a few of the original Divisions containing\ntwo to three hundred adults into smaller ones of about a hundred.*\n\n5. In lately returning to me the printed form of appointment\nwhich I had prepared by your desire, you substituted six months\nfrom its date for the end of 1868 which I had named as the short-\nest term within which the system and the first nominees could be\nfairly tried, and you added a note to the effect that expected\nchanges in the law and in the Police Force would probably render\nthe aid of the volunteers unnecessary after that time. Believing\nthat you acquiesced in the reasons which I then offered against so\nlimited a term, the forms both for the certificates as constables and\nthe appointments as Penghulus and Katuas have been printed with\nthe original term, but the Commissioner of Police, on returning\nthe former signed by him, informed me, at the same time, that you\nstill thought a period of six months would be sufficient. No inti-\nmation of this kind was contained in your memo. of the 30th\nAugust, and I inferred from it that although you wished to proceed\n\n* The appointment of a second deputy head for each division and village\nprimarily intended to meet the case of some of the volunteers of a Division\nbeing called away under one of the heads to act against gang robbers in\nanother Division and the remainder being left under the other head in charge\nof the village, and also as a provision against the sickness or absence of a\nPenghulu or Katua will further lessen the risk of any of the headmen try-\ning to domineer.\ncautiously you would be prepared, should the experiment be successful, to sanction the wider development of the plan. If I had supposed that it was not to have some degree of permanency, but might be abruptly put an end to in six months, I could not have taken it upon me to ask the Malays to adopt it, nor is it likely that they would have done so at all as a mere temporary expedient, or, if they had, that they would have received it in such a spirit as to ensure its good working. It would, I fear, entirely defeat our object if, at this stage, the intimation were made to them (not of course by me) that the system now introduced is only likely to be maintained for a few months. I would submit, with deference, that the fairest as well as most expedient course would be to defer any discouraging step of the kind until the contemplated changes take place, when Government, if it thought fit, could abolish the system, in such a manner and with such explanation of its reasons as would be calculated to lessen any dissatisfaction on the part of the Malays.\n\n6. I hope you will allow me, however, to add some reasons in support of those that may be gathered from my Memo, of 20th August, for not looking on the measure as a mere make-shift pending the adoption of those improvements in the Police for which the Settlement is to be indebted to you, and I would preface these reasons by saying that, although I brought the plan forward as one that was peculiarly and urgently necessary in the somewhat exceptional condition of that portion of Province Wellesley in which I have resided for the last five years. I, long ago, when living in the south of Penang, earnestly advocated the association and organization, with the sanction and support of Government and for the purpose of maintaining the peace and counteracting the various class and religious influences opposed to it, of the Malays and the well-disposed inhabitants of all other classes, including the many Chinese who disapproved of the secret societies and wanted nothing so much as adequate social protection against being absorbed into or persecuted by them. A plan on a narrower basis for giving the assessment committee and, as an after-thought, the Police, the aid of divisional Penghulu* was tried by Mr. Blandell when Resident Councillor of Penang, and so long as he remained here and took a strong personal interest in the Penghulu, much benefit was derived from it. It was afterwards extended to the Province, but too hastily to admit of a good selection of headmen, and it soon fell into neglect. More recently Colonel Man was impressed with\n\n* Penghulu Mukim. Mukim is the territory or rather the group of families attached to a mosque, a parish.\nthe advantages likely to accrue from its revival on a wider basis. It was a subject of frequent conversation between us, and he intended, I believe, to avail himself of my assistance in introducing it in North Province Wellesley, if the Settlement had not passed from under the administration of the Indian Government.\n\n7. No community is exempt from occasional disturbances of the peace on a scale too large to be immediately dealt with by the regular Police or the Military, even if it were desirable to employ the latter, except as a last resource. This Settlement is exposed to these from three sources\u2014the quarrels, originating here or propagated from abroad, of the Chinese societies; those of the Mahomedan jumahas; and the existence of professional banditti in the adjacent Malay states\u2014one of these countries, Perak, being at all times and in all places wretchedly misgoverned by a number of Rajas and district chiefs striving with each other who shall excel in habitual rapacity and occasional rapine, and the other, Kedah, having large and thinly populated wilds all along our eastern boundary. The character and habits of large numbers of our own population, especially of the immigrant and shifting classes, make it very susceptible to such disturbances, and a strong and active element of mischief is supplied, in the case of the allied Mahomedan and Chinese societies, by the ambition, craft and rapacity of a colonial class in which the subtlety of the Chinese, the effrontery of the Kling, and the dissimulation and vanity of both are mingled with the boldness and suavity of the Malay.* From these and from other causes now probably only in their seeds, we cannot expect that the time will soon come when occasions will cease to arise, on which Government must avail itself of the temporary assistance of the well-disposed portion of the local population in resisting violence, because the disciplined force in its regular employment is either not on the scene of disturbance or only present in insufficient numbers. The right of availing itself of the legal obligation of every male above 15 years old to aid in keeping the peace must always be kept in reserve, as this alone can enable Government to oppose, in every part of the Settlement, by a superior force always ready to act, bands of rioters or robbers who may suddenly appear. But our population is very imperfectly acquainted with this legal obligation, and is at present incapable of acting in concert against such bands. On each recurring outbreak of the quarrels of societies or systematic attacks on our villages by gang robbers, we have\n\n* See Note at end.\nseen the rural population paralysed and helpless. It is a principal and the more immediate object of the plan now being introduced, to bring home to the villagers a practical sense of their duty as loyal subjects to aid in keeping the peace of their villages and of the Settlement, and to give them an organization that will, for the first time, make it possible for them to supply such aid, and effectively place them, for that purpose, in the hands of the authorities. The simultaneous disturbances of the peace in many parts of the Settlement by the secret action of societies whose members are found almost everywhere, will be met by an equally ubiquitous and permanent resisting force on the side of order. The existence of such a force can hardly fail to exercise a strong deterring influence on rioters and marauders, and it cannot but strengthen the Government and enable it to use the Police and Military with much greater effect than it can now do, when it must either dissipate their strength and harass the men in the vain attempt to oppose every outbreak, or only succeed in protecting a few places by concentrating its force there and leaving the rest of the country to its fate.\n\n8. The plan will subserve other objects of hardly less importance. The wide difference in manners, religion and education between the higher European Officers of Government and the Native population tends to estrange them almost as much as if the latter were a foreign and conquered nation, and not, as a large proportion are, British subjects born in the Colony. The Malays are very gregarious, and the mass are prone to accept the guidance of those who have any pretention to claim it and will take the trouble to exercise it. At present their personal devotion is chiefly bestowed on their religious leaders and on connections of the royal family of Kedah. It is very desirable that the distance between them and the Officers of Government should be lessened, and that the latter should have the means, when opportunities arise, of establishing such a degree of familiar intercourse with them as is practicable.* At present large numbers in the inaccessible or\n\n* It takes a long time to gain the confidence of the Malays. When a European Official, or any person of position, with whom they are not well acquainted, puts questions to them, they are doubtful of his motives in proportion to their ignorance, and seek to give such replies as will be at once pleasing to him and not unpleasant in their consequences to themselves or their friends. If there are any native bystanders they are doubly cautious, as they know that every word they say may be reported to those whom it may affect. A Malay seldom speaks out the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, unless to those he trusts and when there are no other listeners.\nless frequented villages have no personal knowledge of the higher officers of Government. Government means to most of them a Native Inspector of Police, a Sub-collector of rates, a native Land-surveyor, an Overseer of Public Works with his convicts, and the Kali, all of whom they look upon as impersonations of power, and all of whom, if so disposed, may find exhaustless profit in this persuasion. They have sometimes seen the R\u00e1ja Sabrang \u2022 the R\u00e1ja Polis, \u2020 and the R\u00e1ja Bandwan, \u2021 usually accompanied by some members of the official stratum interposed between them and the higher one to which the powers of the latter are assumed to be delegated. The superior ranks are merged in the vague and mythical idea of \"Kampani\" (East India Company). The great personages with whom they are more immediately concerned are not the European Rajas, but the Native Datu or chiefs, the power of two of whom, each in his department, the Police and the Land Survey, || they believe to be unlimited, and to descend, in various measures, on those who are supposed to stand well with them.\n\nThe recognition of heads of villages named by the villagers themselves will afford a means of mutual access to the higher Officers of Government and to them. It will give all of them a sense of being directly recognised by the R\u00e1ja B\u00e9kar of the Settlement himself as good subjects of the Queen, and of not being merely subjected to the law but of being associated in its maintenance, while the appointments will be objects of a healthy ambition. It will enable Government to inform and influence the population, supplying it, as it were, with an agent and mouth-piece in every kampong. If the system be properly fostered, it will go far to keep the influence of the jumahas and of religious and other leaders within legitimate bounds, and establish a feeling of attachment to and confidence in the superior officers of Government and of loyalty to the Crown.\n\n9. The system will subserve another and most important end\u2014that of gradually educating the Malays. A large proportion of\n\n\u2022 The Police Magistrate.\n\u2020 The Deputy Commissioner of Police.\n\u2021 The Assistant Engineer.\n|| To the imagination of the ordinary Malay the power and resources of the former are boundless. I once overheard a group of Malays talking about a criminal case, and the conclusion at which they arrived was that \"he could make the innocent guilty and the guilty innocent.\" The native surveyors are supposed to have the power of conferring the right to lots of land by surveying them, and the Jutu Sukat Tunah in his visits to the inland districts is received with more distinction than the highest European Officers of Government.\nthe villagers are excessively ignorant, and they suffer seriously from their ignorance. Their want of sanitary knowledge and habits is so great that they may be said to cultivate the diseases that originate in or are fomented by dirt and insufficient ventilation.* The overcrowding of both sexes in small huts invites to immoralities from which their religious scruples are not always strong enough to deter them. Their ignorance of the real character of the Government exposes them to misrepresentations and malpractices, and disables them from using the means of redress which the law provides. While seeing little of educated Europeans, they are sought out by Chinese, Klinga and Malays who are finished in the knowledge and craft acquired in that great school of cheating under the guise of honest mercantile thrift, piety or good nature\u2014an Asiatic seaport where traders of all nations congregate. From an experience extending over thirty years in which I have been almost constantly in close and unrestrained intercourse with the Natives, much of it professional and confidential, I do not hesitate to say that the more stupid and ignorant are defrauded on all hands by the more knowing and crafty. The more ignorant Malay cannot sell his paddy to a Chinese without being cheated, in the confusion to which the illegal but universal use of measures of different sizes and his narrow powers of calculation expose him. Government in its Acts and Regulations lays careful and elaborate plans to protect him from exactions on the part of its subordinates, but these very plans defeat their end, and become means to fresh exactions. So low in the scale reaches the belief of the Malay rustic in the power of every servant of Government to do him good or harm according as he is treated, that he never thinks of questioning the right of even a convict in the Survey Department to a fee for drawing the measuring chain over his land or serving him with a notice, or that of a convict in the Engineer's Department to take his bamboos and plantains without payment. There are usually so many steps between the issue of an order by the head of a Department and its actual execution, that nothing he can do will secure the more ignorant Natives affected by it from being defrauded either by some of his subordinates, or by other persons acting, or professing to act, for them. I make no doubt, to take one Department, that the Malay holders of small lots have, first and last and in one way and\n\n* Hence the frightful extent to which various disgusting cutaneous diseases prevail in every village and almost in every house, and the great mortality, effectually checking the natural increase of the population, from fever, small-pox, diarrhoea and cholera.\nanother, paid for the lands bought by them from Government much more than the amount that has actually been received by Government. As an illustration of the difficulty Government has in at once protecting its own rights and those of the more ignorant Natives, I may mention the case of a sale by auction at the Land Office some time ago of a number of lots for non-payment of quit-rent. The rule was for the notice of sale to be signed by the Resident Councillor himself, and to be entrusted to the Police to be published, thus attempting to provide against collusion by native subordinates in the Land or Surveyor's Office with purchasers. A few days after the sale I was told that some lots held on permit, which I had some time previously bought from Malays, had been sold to a Malay, and on making enquiries it turned out that he was almost the only bidder at the auction and had bought up most of the lots at prices absurdly low. For the fruit trees on one of mine I had paid $25, and was still liable to Government for the price of the land. This lot was knocked down to the man at about $4\u2014land and trees. The notice had been published by placarding it in a few places and by a Police peon beating a gong and proclaiming that certain lots were to be sold, but no special notices were given to the holders of these lots. So far there was ground for presuming collusion between the purchaser and some of the subordinates of Government. But on pushing my enquiries I found that the lot-holders had received notices to take out grants several years previously and had not come forward to do so, not considering the lands to be then worth the Government price, and I was led to infer that some of the more astute were themselves parties to the collusion, which had a double object, the more recondite one being to enable them to get grants at a lower rate than if they had to pay the fixed price as well as rent for these years.\n\nA case came before the court a few years ago in which it was proved that a Malay had obtained large sums from the ryots of some districts on the pretext that he was empowered to take a fee from each to get a survey made, and from what Malays have told me from time to time, I believe that such exactions have been common, and that it is seldom that a survey is made, or grant issued, for one of the more ignorant Malays, without some one or other persuading him into making irregular payments of the kind. The general Municipal Act provides an elaborate system of checks to protect the more ignorant rate-payers from wrong. They must have at least 15 days' special notice of all first assessments and every subsequent increase of valuation, to enable them to get a review of over-valuations; a bill must be presented to\nthem and 5 days given them to pay it; a warrant of distress is then to issue, but no sale is to take place for other 5 days. The fees payable are all fixed by the Act, and there are none until the property has been actually seized as a distress. Nothing would seem better devised to protect the riots. But, in reality, each fresh shield turns into a weapon of exaction in the hands of an unscrupulous bill collector. Fees have been demanded and taken for the notice, and on the warrants of distress when no distress has been made. It may thus readily come about that a stupid Malay pays many times the actual amount of his bill.\n\n10. The Malays in the Province are exposed to suffer not only from the exactions of unscrupulous persons in or hanging about the Police, Land, Survey, Assessment, Engineer's and Magistrates' Departments, and the offices of the Registrar and Agents of the Court, but, to a very large extent, from those of the Kalis, who claim extensive and undefined powers and exercise a jurisdiction to which they have no title. The large and pernicious power of the Kalis, which poisons domestic life among the Malays, is based on a gross misconception. Originally in all Mahomedan countries, and to this day in several, including the native states in India, the Kali is the supreme judge\u2014civil, criminal and ecclesiastical. He is required to administer justice in a public place. In a non-Mahomedan country, the Kalis of Mahomedan communities must derive their authority from the Government of the country. By the law of this Settlement, civil, criminal and ecclesiastical jurisdiction is vested exclusively in the Supreme Court, the Courts of Requests, the Magistrates of Police and the Justices of the Peace. No law gives authority to the local Government to appoint Kalis, recognizes the office, or defines its powers. From an early period in the history of the Settlement, the local Government appears to have appointed persons under the title of Kalis, but without affecting to confer judicial authority on them, or to point out their functions. Governor Blyndell declined to do more than recognize them as persons deriving certain undefined powers from the voluntary election and submission of associations of Mahomedans, declaring that he had no legal authority to appoint them. It may be doubted whether other Governors intended to do more. It is clear that none of them can have assumed to confer on the so-called Kalis any portion of the supreme judicial powers which attach to the office in Mahomedan countries. In practice the Kalis have usurped compulsory jurisdiction over all the Mahomedans inhabiting the district in which they exercise it. Knowing it to be essential to the recognition of their authority,\nthey have affected to hold their appointments from the Government. They have assumed as much of the powers attaching to the office in Mahomedan countries as they have been able to do in the presence of the regularly constituted Courts and Judges of the Settlement, and considerably more, probably, than they would be able to justify, were the question of their legal position and powers formally brought under judicial consideration. Appointed in so irregular a manner, and, as judges, laxly tolerated rather than recognised, the office has been deprived of those safeguards by which the regular administration of justice is surrounded. The Government from which they profess to derive their appointments does not select them or subject them to any test of fitness in respect of character or learning, and it leaves them without control. No public courts are provided for them, and they exercise their judicial functions in their own houses or in small sheds attached to them, which they dignify with the name of Balai shara. Their jurisdiction having no legal foundation and being only limited by the ignorance or acquiescence of suitors, shifts with the requirements of plaintiffs, but is generally understood to be confined to cases between husband and wife, embracing suits by the husband for restitution of conjugal rights, and by the wife for maintenance, dower, co-habitation and divorce. The Kali issue summonses to defendants and witnesses, under his seal. For all such process and its service and for his judgments, he charges fees to a considerable amount. Particular Kalis have, from time to time, been notorious among the natives for their corruption and extortion. They have hired themselves to men colluding with wives to obtain divorces and marry them, or with the parents of young married women seeking to free their daughters from the marriage bond in order to marry them to more wealthy suitors. In such cases, the first step is for the woman to go, or be taken, to the Kali, where a complaint of want of sufficient maintenance or other cause of divorce is entered, or a pretended divorce set up, and the husband summoned. Adjournments are made from time to time, and further evidence adduced and in the meantime the Kali receives bribes from both parties and keeps the woman in his own house where she has no protection against his criminal advances. Cases are even said to have occurred in which Kalis have pandered to their own sons and to friends. It must be said that such practices do not excite the universal disgust and indignation which might be expected and which indeed would prevent their being long indulged in. An old lady, the wife of the founder of one of the mosques at Permatang Bertam, who enjoys a high reputation for piety and strict-\nness, on being asked, with reference to a statement made in her presence by a witness in a case to which a relative of theirs was a party, whether such things could be, and how it came that they were tolerated, replied that it was only for a few days and with the Kali. But Malay fathers and husbands, less indulgent to the frailties of her sex and race than this old lady, have frequently spoken to me bitterly of the extent to which the peace of families is disturbed and immorality promoted by Kalias. Some go so far as to say that most of the Malay women who become prostitutes in town have acquired their vicious habits when residing in the houses of Kalis and induced by them to take this infamous means of raising a fee of $20 or $30 to pay him for the divorce. Even the more respectable Kalis, who are not accused of debauching their suitors or leading them into debauchery, are, with rare exceptions, said to be accessible to bribes, and none of them has the slightest pretension to the qualifications necessary for the judge of a divorce or any other Court. \"I regret to observe,\" writes Colonel Low, \"that, so far as my experience extends, there is not a native at this Settlement of Penang who could be safely entrusted with the power of a Justice of the Peace or even with a lesser judicial independent authority.\" The more cultivated Malays themselves say that the very word Kali is an offence to them, and that\n\n*One of the present Kalis (not now recognised by Government) makes a living by selling inspection of the notes of marriages kept by, or for, his father, who was the great Kali of Penang in his day. In a case that occurred not long ago he demanded $1,000 to search for and produce one of these notes. In this respect he is not worse than any other native would be who had the custody of papers of value. A Penghulu Besar who also acted as a sort of Notary for his district, drew up a will for a Malay who went on the pilgrimage, leaving the will in the Penghulu's keeping. The persons interested could not get it without paying a fee of $30. I advised them to take legal proceedings to recover it, but they said that the Penghulu might deny that he had it, or produce it and give some evidence to invalidate it, and he was so highly reputed by the officers of Government and so much liked and trusted by the Judge that he was sure to be believed. In the former case compulsion would have been equally hazardous, as the opposite party might have made the Kali a present to burn the paper, and he would merely have had to say in Court that no such paper was to be found among his father's records. The Kali's father was a very gentlemanly and pleasant Arab of Mecca, a universal favourite of the Europeans, including the officials. In one of the first cases in which I was engaged in the Court he was called as a witness on the other side to speak as to some paper. In cross examination I asked him if he could read and write. He indignantly desired the interpreter to give him a Koran and began to read fluently from it, but unfortunately it turned out that he held it upside down, and I fear he never quite forgave me the discovery. He knew a great deal of it by heart.*\nthe temptations to which the office exposes its holders are so great that a good man who takes it soon becomes a bad one. None of the learned Malays of any reputation will accept it. The more ignorant Malays of the interior are exposed to be fleeced by any one who pretends to be a Kali. Lately when at Kamlun I found a Malay going about among his friends in great anxiety of mind to borrow the large sum, for him and them, of ten dollars. On enquiring into the cause, I learned that his wife had left him a few days before on pretext of visiting a sister at Bagan Jermal. Next day he received a summons under the chap of a Haji at Bagan Ajam professing to be a Kali, but of whom and his jurisdiction the Kamlun villagers had previously been happily in ignorance. He hastened to the sister, who told him that his wife was with the Kali. He went to the Kali, who would not produce her, but told him that if he wanted to get her back he must pay $10, \"which is as much,\" said the man plaintively, \"as I paid for her twenty years ago when she was a virgin\" (meaning her dower).\n\n11. The Malays of the interior are also infested by a class of parasitical Malays, or half Malays, who make it their business to spy out flaws in titles and latent causes of family disputes, incite to litigation, get the partition and sale of lands into their hands, and usually exact a share of the property much beyond what any fair commission or actual costs of suit would amount to. Their own ignorance and carelessness are themselves a fruitful source of trouble and litigation. Wills are seldom brought into Court to be proved, or letters of administration applied for, until many years, sometimes 20 or 30, after the death of a land-holder and when, owing to intermediate deaths, it is difficult or impossible to prove the will or come to a satisfactory decision on contested facts of marriage, divorce or paternity. A will was brought to me a few days ago which had been acted on, without probate, for about 20 years. The testator had added some extraordinary imprecations at the end of it to prevent any of his family attempting to disregard it, but he had not signed it, neither he nor the writer appearing to have known that this was essential and would have accomplished what his legacy of curses has failed to do. There was a case in Court a few years ago which turned entirely on the question whether the person named, as grantee in a Government grant of a piece of land was the father or the grand-father of certain of the claimants, and after hearing much evidence, and giving the parties every opportunity to call additional witnesses, the Recorder was unable to make up his mind on the subject.\n\n12. It appears to me that all these evils in mind, body and\nestate, arise from one source, ignorance, and can only be effectually cured by removing it. The system of village organization supplies the means of making a beginning in this work. The attempts hitherto made by Government to educate the Malays of the Province have failed, because the object aimed at was indefinite and too remote from their daily life and business. The Malays have already a large amount of valuable practical knowledge, well fitted to carry them successfully through life in a purely Malay country. The first step should be to add to it that business knowledge which will adapt them to their present position as British subjects. Their first want is that of some plain elementary information about their duties in keeping the peace and suppressing crime, the powers and mode of arresting criminals, the positions and powers of the different officers and servants of Government, the rules relating to sales of Government land and assessment, the fees payable under the land, assessment and other regulations that affect them most closely, the effect of marriage and divorce on rights to property, the mode of making wills, the division of the estates of intestates, the maintenance of wives, the maintenance, custody and guardianship of children, as to what cases must be taken to a Magistrate and what to the civil courts, what are the real powers of Kali, &c. They would also learn, what few of them know, that the courts are not shut in the face of those who are too poor to pay the usual fees. Short tracts in Malay, containing information of this kind, placed in the hands of the Katuas, and supplemented by occasional discussions with them and the villagers by the Magistrate when visiting the districts, would, I am certain, be valued by the Malays, and in time, give them a sufficient store of useful knowledge to protect them from the more gross oppressions and exactions to which their ignorance now exposes them. In most of the villages one or more persons who can read are to be found.\n\nThe first step having been taken and time given to make good their footing so far, tracts might follow containing some common sanitary facts, shewing the advantages of good ventilation, of cleanliness in the kampong, house, dress and cooking, of vaccination, of drainage, that the proper place for dirt is not under the house but under the ground at the roots of their trees; and while enlightening them on these homely matters the opportunity might be taken to get the Katuas to set about the adoption of the sanitary provisions of the Conservancy Act and keeping the common village paths and drains in better order.\nThe use of the Roman characters instead of the Arabo-Persian for Malay might, in due time, be introduced, as the Dutch have done so successfully and with such signal practical advantages in Netherlands India. When some progress had been made in establishing village schools on this basis, a new zest and larger scope might be given to their awakening literary appetite by supplying them with copies of some of the best works extant in their own language but of which few of them have ever heard, with translations of some of the Arabian Nights, and the like. Tracts on geography and ethnography, the elementary facts of meteorology, astronomy, botany, &c., might follow in due time. No attempt would, of course, be made to meddle with their religion. All attempts of the kind have hitherto failed and only tended to excite suspicion and arouse bigotry. We may freely allow to them, with some qualifications at which they will not take umbrage, that the better Mahomedan the better man.*\n\n13. In my memorandum of 20th August I suggested that, in addition to their duties of a Police nature, the Penghulus might have others assigned to them, such as keeping a registry of the inhabitants, of births, deaths, marriages, divorces, &c. Each might be supplied with a blank book in which to write, or get written, a diary of all such events, and others of public importance or interest, such as crimes and offences, accidents to life, floods, droughts, the state of the crops, &c. This would itself serve as some stimulus to education, and it would furnish a contemporary record valuable in courts of justice and materials for general official registries to be kept by the Magistrates.\n\nThe Penghulus and Katusas might also do much good service with little trouble to themselves by assisting in protecting the public rivers, canals, drains, embankments, roads, and landing places from injury and giving immediate notice of injuries which they have been unable to prevent to the nearest resident officer of Public Works. At present water-courses of all kinds are almost constantly being injured or obstructed by buffaloes, fishing stakes and traps, dams, &c. Roads, paths and canals in course of formation are seriously damaged by cattle. Works like the Muda Bund are liable to be injured during their progress, and after completion require constant watching to prevent careless or malicious damage. The heads of the villages along the course of such works might give good aid in protecting them. Few of the landing places are kept in good order. When the harvest is over herds of hundreds\n\n* See Note at end.\nof buffaloes are let loose over the plains and public roads, and though a vigorous attempt was made by the Police last year complaints made by the Assistant Engineer and myself to prevent cattle trespass, it failed, owing to the number of the cattle, difficulty of catching them or ascertaining the names of the owners and the little time policemen have to spare for the purpose.\n\nI would further venture to recommend that, instead of the elaborate system of protection against over-valuations and exacting provided by the Assessment Act, an account in Malay of the rates payable by the inhabitants of each village be given to the Penghulu and by them to the Katuas, about two or three months before the day on which payment is to be made, and explained to the villagers. They would much prefer this to the present system, and the Katuas and Penghulus are prepared to have the money ready on the date fixed, when the Collector would only have to attend at the nearest Police Station, receive it, and sign the receipt on the account. This would supersede the necessity of making out bills and notices and employing so many bill collectors and their subordinates, and if the commission now allowed for collection were given to the Katuas it would make the office more prized. The Penghulus might be allowed a small proportion of it and be exempted, as the old Penghulus were, from rates on their lands and houses. The collection was at one time entrusted to Penghulu Mukims on a commission, but cases of default occurred, owing partly to a bad selection of Penghulus, but chiefly to the sums which each had to collect being too large. The sum for which each Katua will be responsible will be too small to offer a temptation to embezzlement. The plan might be tried without any alteration of the Act. The Katuas and Penghulus will also be very useful in settling petty disputes and maintaining good feeling among the villagers. When quarrels arise between inhabitants of different kampongs or dairahs, the Katuas and Penghulus might form councils of conciliation.\n\nThe Penghulus might also be entrusted, under the control of the Magistrate, Engineer, or other European Officer, with the regulation of the supply of water from the drains for irrigation in the dry season. At present the Malays dam the drains to flood their fields without reference to the needs of their neighbours above or below.\n\n14. Along with the Rolls I enclose a table with the names of the dairahs and kampongs, their Penghulus and Katuas and the number of male adults in each who have signed the Rolls. The total number of the latter is 3,063, representing a general population, women and children included, which may be estimated.\nabout 20,000. As both married and unmarried women hold lands and other property, marriage not affecting the right of the wife in her estate, real or personal, the influence of the Katusa and Penghulus embraces a much larger number of persons than appears from the Rolls.\n\n15. In conclusion, I venture to remark that while the village organization may with advantage be permanently maintained for some of its purposes, I would contemplate a gradual curtailment of the duties of the heads, as the progress of cultivation and, with it, of the revenue enables Government to make adequate provision for Police, Conservancy, District Courts, and Schools in North Province Wellesley. If we had a sufficient number of intelligent and trained policemen, the regular employment of village constables would be unnecessary and objectionable. At present many of the policemen are not better educated or more intelligent, and are probably less trustworthy, than the least promising of the Malays selected by the villagers as their headmen.\n\nI have, &c.,\n\nJ. R. LOGAN.\n\nPermatang Bertam,\n22nd November, 1867.\n\nNote to para. 7.\n* The late Colonel Low, for so many years Superintendent of Province Wellesley, described this class graphically, and his remarks apply not only to the Jawi-pakans properly so called, but to all descendants of Indians born and brought up in the Settlement. \"A Jawi-pakan is the offspring of a man of Hindustan [India] and a Malayan woman [or a descendant of such an union]. He inherits the boldness of the Malay and the subtlety, acuteness and disimulation of the Hindoo [Indian]. He is indefatigable in the pursuit of wealth and most usurious in the employment of it when gained. Few employments come amiss to him. He cloaks ignorance where it exits, or makes up for it by pretence and zeal. His fingers seem to have a chemical affinity for the precious metals; he avoids downright theft, yet the transit of money or money's worth through the former is at a discount varying in amount according to his calculations of detection. He is cringing to superiors, overbearing, and, where there is no check on his conduct, tyrannical to inferiors; like one of the feline tribe when it has changed its quarters, he carefully obtains a perfect acquaintance with all the trapdoors, outlets and hiding crevices of the portion in which he is placed. Thus secured he makes the most of that position. If he holds a public situation, he tries to balance his pecuniary advantages with the necessaries of existence and generally succeeds, and should this fail he compounds for safety with his defrauded creditors and dupes, and quashes informations. It is not here intended to include a whole class in the above description, yet it is to be feared that exceptions to the picture are fewer than could be wished. When under strict management, the Jawi-pakans are undoubtedly a very useful class.\nin the Straits, and might not conveniently be dispensed with.\"\u2014Dissertation, &c.\n\nThe class of these men in the public offices are mostly related by blood or marriage. The progenitors were Jawi-pakans of Kedah, but while some of the present 1st and 2nd cousins are not distinguishable from Malays, others are hardly distinguishable in person from Kling. The paid Police Punggulies, the collectors of Government rents and Municipal rates, the land measurers, the shroffs, Malay Writers and Interpreters have always largely belonged to this family alliance, which also includes several of the leading men of the jumahas, many of the principal Malay and Kling (Pangkor born) merchants, and maintains a confidential connection with the Kedah Courts. Members of it are often employed by the Raja of Kedah as kruises and land-measurers. Captain Light, in a despatch to the Supreme Government of India, dated 12th September, 1786, gives, in the course of a report on the state of affairs in Kedah, a strong instance of the extent to which the cunning of natives of India and their descendants sometimes enables them to rule Malays. \"Datu Sri Raja (formerly named Ismal, and a common coolie) is now the King's merchant; he is a deep, cunning, villainous Chuliah. By working on the King's pusillanimity and raising jealousies, he reduced the power of the great men and expressed the whole of the administration, by preferring only such as he thought attached to himself. To save the King from pretended assassinations, he built a small brick fort and built him up as in a cage; no one dares presume to go to audience without his knowledge. If he found any of the great men likely to get into favour, he bribed them to his interest. By monopolising every species of commerce, and oppressing the Malays, he found means to supply the King's necessities without his having the trouble to enquire how it [the money] came.\" \"He [the king] receives likewise a deal in presents and fines. Every person who has any demand to make, or suit to prefer, first presents a sum of money which he thinks adequate to the demand; if the King approves of the sum he signs the paper, and his suit is obtained, however another person comes with greater sums.\" This would serve as an account of the administration of justice in the Malay States at the present day.\n\nThe Colonial Chinese (Baba) by intermarrying among themselves, and the women with pure Chinese, have largely eliminated the original Malay half-blood. They are distinguished by their conceit and forwardness; but have more softness and amenity of manner than the Jawi-pakans; retaining, in this respect, the impress of their Malay decent and association. They are intelligent, bold and pushing, and some of the leading men of the Secret Societies, notably the head of the Tua-peh-kong, are drawn from this class. It is through their intimacy with the town Jawi-pakans and the Malay heads of the jumahas that the latter societies have been so easily brought into alliance with the former, notwithstanding the ban placed by Mahomedanism on all friendly association with \"infidels.\" It should be added that there is a considerable class composed of Jawi-pakans, Babas and Malays who are noted for their \"fast\" lives, and many of whom are led on from gambling and licentiousness to theft and other crimes. Their recklessness and love of mischief and excitement render them a dangerous element in the societies, to which large numbers of them belong.\n\nThe Chinese are gradually pushing their way among the Malays of North Province Wellesley, and as they increase in numbers and wealth, the Malays borrow money from them whenever they can, become more dependent on them and more liable to be seduced into joining their societies. At present\nthese settlers are chiefly Hokkien shop-keepers or hawkers, and Kwang-Tung paddy planters and rice dealers, who have little social connection with the Malays, but this does not prevent their getting wives among the needier Malays and Samsams. The time is not far distant when the babaes will have more influence in many parts of the Province than the Jawi-pakans now have.\n\nAs the Malays themselves form the great mass of the population of North Province Wellesley and considerable errors are to be found in the published accounts of the character and habits of the race, including even that by Mr. VAUGHAN in the Journal of the Indian Archipelago, which is, in many respects, just to them and a great advance on previous delineations of them, I subjoin an extract from some notes on the races of the Settlement and the Malay Peninsula which, at the request of the Local Government, I furnished, about two years ago, for transmission to the Government of India. They apply more to the fully cultivated and peopled than to the wilder districts of the Province.\n\n\"The Malay is good-natured, courteous, sociable, gregarious and gossiping, finding unfailing amusement in very small and often very indelicate talk, jokes, and pleasantries. To domestic and social superiors he is extremely deferential, but with no taint of that obsequious fawning servility which characterises many Asiatics of higher civilisation. His intellect has little power of abstraction, and delights in a minute acquaintance with the common things around him, a character that reflects itself in his language, which is as rich in distinctions and details in the nomenclature of material objects and actions as it is poor in all that relates to the operations of the mind. He is slow and sluggish, and impatient of continuous labour of mind or body. He is greedy and niggardly, and when his interests are involved his promises and professions are not to be trusted.\n\nThe Malay treats his children with great affection and with indolent indulgence. Women are not secluded, and the freedom which they enjoy in their paternal home is little abridged in after-life. Early marriage is customary and necessary, for if it were long postponed after puberty, it is to be feared that their religion would not always restrain them from the license which the habits of the non-Mahomedan nations of the same race permit to unmarried girls. In the Malay States the law sanctions slavery and subjects the person of the female slave to the power of her master. In this Settlement the Malay finds compensation for the deprivation of this right in that of divorce, and the extent to which it is availed of in practice renders marriage little more than the legalisation of temporary concubinage. The inducements allowed to women and the manner in which their parents and other relatives usually take their part in domestic quarrels, enable them to purchase their divorce, or worry their husbands into granting it, whenever they wish to take new ones.\n\nThe habitual courtesy and reticence of the Malay and the influence of his religion too often mask the sway of interest and passion to which he may be secretly yielding, and under which he becomes rapacious, deceitful, treacherous and revengeful. It has become customary to protest against the dark colours in which the earlier European voyagers painted him, but their error was less in what they wrote than in what they left unwritten. Under bad native governments, leading a wandering life at sea or on thinly peopled borders of rivers\u2014the only highways in lands covered with forest and swamp\u2014* See No. 7 of this Journal p. 88.\u2014Ed.\n\u2014trusting to the kris and spear for self-defence and holding in traditional respect the prowess of the pirate and robber, the Malays become proverbial for feline treachery and bloodthirstiness. Under the Government to which they have been subjected in Province Wellesley, and which has certainly not erred on the side of paternal interference, for it has given them as much liberty as the English yeoman possesses, they now form a community, on the whole, as settled, contented, peaceable and free from serious crime as any to be found in British India\u2014a result due to the disappearance of forests, the formation of roads, the establishment of a regular Police and the administration of justice by English lawyers.\n\nTo complete this brief Note on the various classes entering into the population of North Province Wellesley, a reference must be made to the Sambas, the descendants of rude inland Siamese of Kedah who, some generations back, were converted to Mahomedanism, a religion which still sits loosely on them. They form the majority of the inhabitants of many of the North-eastern villages, in which Siamese is still the current language, although, with few exceptions, they speak Malay also. Many of them are more stupid and ignorant even than the Malays in the same condition of life, and many are knavish, thievish, and addicted to gambling and opium-smoking. Of both races, indeed, it may be said that while the mass are ruder and simpler than any other class of our composite population, there are among them many men habitually predatory, and dangerous from their treachery or ferocity. Their cunning, however, is without the intelligent fore-thought and subtlety of the more advanced races, and they set about crimes not of blood only but of fraud, such as forgery and false personation, in a careless, bold and straightforward manner, in apparent unconsciousness of the risk of detection to which they lay themselves open, and often, in the latter class of crimes, on the instigation of others and without any clear knowledge of the real character and consequences of their acts.\n\nNote to Para: 12.\n\nAs a religion Mahomedanism is infinitely superior to the native religions of the Archipelago. Its most objectionable feature, in a political point of view, is not the universality and closeness of the brotherhood which it establishes among its professors, but its arrogant exclusiveness. It tolerates other creeds but places their holders under a social ban. Friendly association with unbelievers is a deadly sin and makes the sinner liable to excommunication. Since the riots of August one of the ulimah has put in force this doctrine to detain the Malays from the Chinese Societies, but it is equally applicable to friendly association with Europeans, and might, in certain contingencies, be used to excite hatred to this class and opposition to Government. Hence the impolicy of allowing any of these ulimah, or any so called Kali, to assume jurisdiction, or social or spiritual government, over the Mahomedans generally, or large sections of them. Their recognised associations should be confined to the jamatohs or congregations attached to each mosque; and the persecutions every now and then made by the leaders, to which those are exposed who will not submit to the attempts at establishing by compulsion faithfulness to the rules of private liberty, should be dis- countenanced, and, when they overstep the limits of discipline allowed to other religious societies, punished. The more the influence of the gurus or religious teachers in the Province extends, the more arrogant they become. They entirely lose the courteous and deferential manner of the ordinary Malay, and mark their sense of their superiority to the European infidel by either ignoring his presence\naltogether, or, if saluted by him in the usual mode, returning the courtesy by\nthe least respectful of the several modes of salutations practised by Mahomedans.\n\nMinute on Mr. J. R. Logan's Scheme for forming a Volunteer\nVillage Police in Province Wellesley.\n\nThe subject of a Volunteer Village Police has frequently\nengaged my attention, and I have often discussed the question\nwith Mr. Logan, who has long advocated its adoption in the pub-\nlic prints. The plan seems peculiarly well suited to our posi-\ntion in Province Wellesley, which possesses an irregular jungle\nfrontier, where marauders can always find shelter and conceal-\nment and can threaten our villages at all points with perfect im-\npunity so far as the Municipal Force is concerned. The whole of\nthe N. E. and E. frontier may be said to be entirely without\nPolice protection, and any scheme that promises to enlist the\nassistance of the villagers in aid of order and to supply the place\nof a Police Establishment should, in my opinion, be cordially\nwelcomed and supported by Government.\n\nA village Police will not only be useful against external marau-\nders, but also in the case of internal commotions caused by the\nSecret Societies, when, sometimes, large gangs roam over the\ncountry uncontrolled, until a hasty collection has been made of\nthe rural population, which, if properly organised on the system\nproposed by Mr. Logan, would certainly prevent any serious\ncollection of rioters, or at any rate be well prepared to cope with\nthem if they should venture to take the field. There is another\nincidental advantage attending the establishment of a Village\nPolice, which would be of vast benefit in giving a support to\nnumbers of Malay and other inhabitants who are now intimidated\ninto joining the Secret Societies by their isolation. If they could\ncount on the support of the village chiefs and their brethren as-\nsociated with them in the service, they might bid defiance to all\nthreats of the heads of Jumahas or Hoys who would be afraid\nto play an open game where they might be speedily brought to\naccount.\n\nIf I remember rightly, Mr. Logan had gained the adhesion in\nthe North Division of the Province of about 3,500 Malays and\nothers in favour of his proposed plan. I am surprised and great-\nly regret that a trial was not made of it. The expense attending\nit was trivial, while it supplied a palpable want which has little\nchance of being otherwise met.\nIt was my intention to have availed myself of Mr. Logan's assistance in inaugurating such a project when the transfer of the Government took all power out of my hands.\n\nI have perused with much interest the valuable memoir on the population of the Province drawn up by Mr. Logan for the information of the new Government. It shews what a useful auxiliary to the peace and safety of the community the scheme he advocates would prove, how easily the force could be raised and turned to account, and how consonant its guiding principles are to the habits and ideas of the people. I trust it is not improbable that when the new Officials have become more familiarised with Malay customs and feelings they will consent to give a trial to this force, of which it can, at any rate, be said, that if not found so advantageous as its promoters assert, it can in no way effect the slightest possible harm.\n\nH.

Each character is associated with a particular part of the human frame and this diagram is extensively used in interpreting dreams. Thus if you dream of ears you should stake on Thai Peng or Kun Giok, if of the neck on Jit San, and so on. The characters are here classified as follows:\u2014\n\nFour of the highest degree (Chong Guan), viz.:\u2014\nTan Hong Chun, Tan Eng Seng, Tan Pan Kwi and Gaw Cham Khoi.\n\nSeven Traders, viz.:\u2014\nAng Yu Li, Chu Kong Beng, Chan Hok Sun, Liong Keng Su, Hong Mow Lim, Teh Pit Taik and Loh Chit Taik.\n\nFour Priests, viz.:\u2014\nLow Cheng Li, Teh Thian Liang, Tan Jit San and Tioh Hoey Kwan.\n\nFive Generals, viz.:\u2014\nLi Han Hun, Wi Kun San, Song Cheng Sun, Li Guat Poh and Wi Chi Koh.\n\nFour Ladies, viz.:\u2014\nSiang Hap Tong, Beh Siang Chiow, Li Beng Chu and Lim Gin Giok.\n\nFour Happy-lot, viz.:\u2014\nLim Thai Peng, Tioh Kiu Kwan, Tioh Hap Hai and Tioh Sam Wei.\n\nOne Nun, viz.:\u2014\nTan An Su.\n\nTwo Friars, viz.:\u2014\nTioh Tian Sin and Chiu Cheng Hun.\nFive Beggars, viz.:\u2014\n\nTan Kiat Pin, Tioh Guan Kiat, So Cheng Guan, Tioh Ban Kim and Chi Guan Kwi.\n\nThe Lottery is thus conducted in the Straits:\u2014A person wishing to open it, issues a notice that on a certain date he will open Hua-Hoey under a certain chop and that he will be responsible to all winners who stake up to such and such an amount either with him or his agents.\n\nThese Agents go round, and, according to agreement, are allowed to receive stakes up to a certain limit, say $2, but on their own account they may receive larger stakes. They carry what are usually termed hongs, i.e., papers on which the stakes are entered. In case the staker is well known to the agent, no acknowledgment is given, but the staker may receive a ticket or scrap of paper, or else he writes down on a slip of paper, which he hands to the agent, the names of the animals he wishes to stake on and the amount. The accompanying is a specimen of the staking papers used in Hua-Hoey.\n\n|   | Animal                  |\n|---|-------------------------|\n| 1 | White fish\u2014Cham Khoi    |\n| 2 | Shell or Dragon\u2014Pan Kwi |\n| 3 | Goose (White)\u2014Eng Seng  |\n| 4 | Peacock\u2014Hong Chun       |\n| 5 | Lion or Earth-worm\u2014Chi Koh |\n| 6 | Rabbit or Tortoise\u2014Guat Poh |\n| 7 | Pig\u2014Cheng Sun           |\n| 8 | Tiger\u2014Kun San           |\n| 9 | Buffalo\u2014Han Hun         |\n|10 | Alligator or Dragon\u2014Kang Su |\n|11 | White Dog\u2014Hok Sun       |\n|12 | White Horse\u2014Kong Beng   |\n|13 | Elephant\u2014Yu Li          |\n|14 | White Cat or Dog\u2014Chi Taik |\n|15 | Mouse\u2014Pit Taik          |\n|16 | Wasp or Bee\u2014Mow Lim     |\n|17 | Stork\u2014Cheng Hun         |\n|18 | Cat\u2014Thian Sin           |\nThere are, it will be seen, thirty-six columns, at the head of each of which is the sign of one of the Hua-Hoey characters. The marks* (which have a conventional meaning) and figures (Chinese) represent the amount either cents or dollars staked on each animal and the last column is the total of stakes received. A person wishing to stake a large amount, say $5 or $10, on an animal will sometimes write the name on a piece of paper and seal it up, delivering it with the stake to the manager of the Hua-Hoey or an agent.\n\nThe lottery is opened twice a day, usually at noon and 6 p.m., and at the appointed hour the winning number (animal) is exhibited, and the result declared in the streets. Previously to this, the agents have brought in their staking papers. If the lottery is worked fairly, of course the manager who declares the winning number should be ignorant as to the amounts staked on the different animals. In China, the papers on which the stakes are entered are folded up in a packet and are not inspected till the winner has been declared, when the winning tickets are chopped and the owners of them are paid.\n\n* Generally entered in pencil.\nIn the Straits, these lotteries are not fairly worked, and the animal least favoured by the public is often the winner. Stakers receive thirty times their stake, less a small commission paid to the agent, from whom they receive their winnings, and this leaves a good margin of profit for the bank. A manager, for the sake of gain, or out of spite, has been known to stake by deputy a large amount with one of his agents on the animal which he means to declare as the winner. The agent is \"broke\" and those who have staked on the winning animal are defrauded of their gains. This is only one of the many ways of swindling practised in regard to these lotteries in the Straits.\n\nIt must not be supposed that it is only the Chinese who gamble at Hua-Hoey. The wealthy Baba, born in the Straits, the respectable trader, their wives and daughters, the petty shopkeeper and the coolie who works by the day, Kling and Malays, women and children, all alike are unable to resist the temptation to gamble. The Manila lottery is only drawn once a month. Manila is a long way off, and the chance of winning a prize is very remote, still it has its fascinations for the practical Englishman and even the cautious Scotehman has been known to invest his money in this speculation year after year. The Hua-Hoey lottery is drawn twice every day in different parts of the town and the excitement is ever fresh. An outlay of 10 cents, which is within the means of any coolie, may bring in $3.\n\nWomen are largely employed in the Hua-Hoey business, while their husbands are at the shop or sailing (as they appear to be very often). They spend their idle time in collecting stakes and staking themselves. They have diamonds and gold ornaments in profusion, and while any of these remain, they can gamble to their heart's content.* Those lower in the social scale, unblessed with diamonds or ready money, beg, borrow or steal in order that they may gamble.\n\nDreams play a great part in Hua-Hoey and the confirmed Hua-Hoey player gets to think of nothing else but the chance of his winning on the morrow. According to his dreams, he stakes.\n\n* A few days ago the wife of a trader in Penang having lost at Hua-Hoey over $1,000 during his absence tried to commit suicide.\u2014(February, 1866.)\nplacing the unsuccessful gamblers in a position amounting to suicide. Parents, husbands, wives, sisters, brothers, and not seldom, employers also, undergo great affliction, bringing through its consequence the greatest distress to the community at large.\n\n4. That this method of gambling contains 37 signs or numbers, namely:\u2014Unn Soo; Thye Peng; Kong Bang; Cheng Soon; Jit-San; Moh Lim; Seang Choow; Hoon Kuan; Che Koe; Chee Hoon; Cheam Khoay; Eng Seing; Sam Hoey; Kew Kuan; Guat Poh; Ban Kim; Khoon San; Kin Geok; Hup Hie; Beng Choo; Kung Soo; Kong Choon; Cheng Lee; Hock Soone; Ewe Lee; Pit Tek; Han Hoon; Thean Siu; Thean Liang; Cheng Guan; Guan Kwei; Guan Keat; Keat Pin; Phan Kwei; Im Hoey; Hup Tong; and Chee Tek.\n\n5. That your Memorialists would beg to call attention that \"Wha Hoey\" gambling is a game of fraud and imposition, it is not managed as other gambling games, with the \"Wha Hoey\" keepers it is always \"Heads I win and Tails you lose.\" By other games the person wishing to go in for a chance does so personally, but in \"Wha Hoey\" agents are procured to act for him or her. \"Wha Hoey\" is in fact carried on by way of proxy; for example, a lady will send her servant or servants to stake for her, or the keeper sends his orderly secretly to the parties' house to collect the monies and numbers of tickets that the party may choose to hazard on. The parents, husbands, or employers being unaware of what is being done, and, if there is not ready cash, the party he or she secretly pawns jewels, and other paraphernalia and the proceeds therefrom with the hazard tickets are deposited to the keeper's orderly, if the party loses he or she never see any part of their stake again.\n\n6. That most of the Chinese servants employed by Europeans and Chinese families cause their employers any amount of anxiety and annoyance, for, when they receive money to purchase things for domestic purposes they squander it away upon \"Wha Hoey\" then, supply their employers with inferior and detrimental victuals.\n\n7. That this fraudulent system of \"Wha Hoey\" gambling is not in any way discouraged by the authorities in Penang, because as far as your Memorialists know they have no power by Law to do so. It is carried on in Institutions got up for the purpose, but here exist places where certain parties who cannot well attend the Institutions meet at some private place which is secured for the purpose, and the gambling gone on clandestinely undisturbed by the proper Officials. Whereas in Perak, Selangore, the Dutch and\nFrench Colonies your Memorialists are informed that even in the Licensed Gambling Farms such a mode of gambling is entirely disallowed by the Government, and is suppressed immediately on discovery.\n\n8. That the keepers of these \"Wha Hoey\" establishments open them twice each day, and as is generally the case the person who may be a child or a poor coolie or a blind person, trying his or her fortune to gain, will place a stake of say (1) one cent upon the \"Wha Hoey\" if such person gains he or she will receive (30) thirty cents, but if the choice of signs fail which is generally the case they lose all, in this way thousands of dollars are brought to the \"Wha Hoey\" manager. The \"Wha Hoey\" keeper guarantees to be responsible to the lucky players for only say $1,000; but supposing the successful players win $2,000 or more, the keeper will only divide his guaranteed $1,000 amongst them, again if say two thousand persons or more were to put a dollar each and all of them are unsuccessful the \"Wha Hoey\" keeper pockets the whole $2,000 or more. By which means he manages to squeeze money fraudulently out of the poor, as well as the rich. The mode by which the frauds are practised by the manager of a \"Wha Hoey\" may be represented as thus:\u2014The Manager makes it known that the maximum amount of his loss in one forenoon, say is $2,000. The Ticket to be produced by him for one stake being as a matter of course known to himself and his partners he clandestinely slips in a ticket or as many as he likes identical with the one to be produced, to win say $1,200. Thus his so called maximum loss, if he can ever lose at all, is practically reduced to $800 only.\n\n9. So wily are the \"Wha-Hoey\" Keepers that sometimes they write on the sand the winning number, then rub it out with their feet at other times it is written in the palm of their hands, when there is no chance for the above they shout out. The place of thus proclaiming the character being first made known, a great number of people young and old assemble to hear it, when the time is fixed they take every trouble to meet at the appointed rendezvous to hear the character or successful sign proclaimed, and as soon as the successful sign is given, all the people interested announce the same throughout the town, in crowds as people coming out of a theatre or retiring from a riot.\n\n10. Your Memorialists would like the Honourable Members of the Legislative Council to know that twenty years ago or there-\nabout the gambling game of \"Wha Hoey\" was carried on in Penang and Province Wellesley and owing to the calamity and suffering caused by this abominable game the Police were then forced to take active measures for its suppression; and owing to the heavy fines (sometimes up to $3,000) and the rigorous imprisonment imposed on the \"Wha Hoey\" keepers by the Magistrates caused terror and consternation amongst them, since then it has been discontinued until within the last year or so, when it has reopened and increased with re-doubled vigour.\n\nIn consideration of the above-mentioned representation to your Excellency and others the Honourable the Members of the Legislative Council, your Memorialists request, implore and pray for your kind view and deliberation of this subject and beg that you will cause inquiries to be made as to the fact of the present description of \"Wha Hoey\" and that it may please The Honourable Members of Council to take steps in the meantime to issue such orders as to prevent \"Wha Hoey\" gambling and gradually to pass an Act or Ordinance for the purpose of totally putting a stop to this ruinous gambling game of \"Wha Hoey\" which is daily sapping the earnings, energy, and comfort of poor coolies, women, well to do men, of good society and in good business and pecuniary circumstances, and children.\n\nAnd your Memorialists as in duty bound will always pray, &c.\n\n(Signed) GHO AIK GHO, and others.\n\nDated at Penang this 30th day of September, 1885.\nON THE ROOTS IN THE MALAY LANGUAGE.\n\nFROM THE DUTCH\n\nOF\n\nJ. PIJNAPP\u00c9L.*\n\nIn the present flourishing condition of philological study on scientific principles, one can scarcely marvel at the fact that the Indo-Germanic or Aryan family should have appropriated to itself the lion's share of general attention, but, that there should still be any uncertainty regarding its practical relationship to the branches descended from other stocks, is quite inexcusable. Although we do not, at the present day, take what may be called a bird's-eye view of these languages as was formerly done, and find that, on the contrary, each one of them now enjoys its own peculiar share of notice bestowed upon it by some one or other, there is, nevertheless, in respect both of the number of students and of their manner of procedure, much still left to be desired, since the subject does not always receive the full justice to which it is entitled. Perhaps there would be no harm done by giving an example to illustrate how other languages, independent of the Indo-Germanic, can be made to supply even more particles towards the building up of our science than have hitherto been collected. To this end we have, as specialists, selected from the particular province of our research \"the form of Malay words previous to their extension in meaning through the addition of affixes.\"\n\n* \"Over de Wortel woorden in de Maleische taal,\" a paper read by Dr. J. Pijnapp\u00e9L in Section 5, Polyn\u00e9sienne, of the Oriental Congress held at Leyden in September, 1833.\nCompetent authorities on the Indo-Germanic, in speaking the roots in these languages, inform us that they really exist only at that period when the various branches had not separated themselves from the parent stock. As to their form at that date, and whether it was monosyllabic or dissyllabic, this has not yet been satisfactorily settled or agreed upon. Now in the Malay languages it is altogether different; here we continually meet with them as significant, current words, which reason they may be justly classified as \"root-words,\" but these latter must not be confounded with such as we are accustomed to look upon as primitives or radical words in consideration of the derivatives obtained from them, because the same primitives, when dissyllabic (their usual form), may often be readily recognised as constituting compound words which, on being resolved, prove to be nothing more than the product resulting from the combination of two simple elements or articles not yet entirely lost to the language or obsolete for colloquial purposes: it is to these simple elements that we have to look for the true roots. As for applying the information obtained to any one branch in particular or comparing it with any other languages except such as belong to the Malay group, this we leave to further investigation to accomplish, flattering ourselves that some light will presently be cast upon certain points of interest to Philology in general, which may, possibly, be turned to good account.\n\nToo much, however, should not be expected. In entering upon the subject concerning the origin of Malay words, I would, by way of preface, mention that in this discourse we have principally availed ourselves of a certain source which, although exceedingly rich in itself, cannot be said to have entirely excluded the others: we are here referring to \"verbal reproductions of sound.\" The Malay languages are remarkably rich in \"tone-imitative-words\" and, in accounting for this wealth, it is necessary once more to have recourse to the argument that it is here a question of an aboriginal people who have acquired an ear sensible to the minutest distinctions of sound, so as would be almost, if not quite, imperceptible to ourselves. The facility and acuteness with which the Malay is capable of distinguishing between slight variations in tone, is indeed\nmarkable. The following will even more than exemplify this. These can be little doubt that words of this class would furnish us with an admirable insight into the ancient condition of the people by whom they are employed were we but able, not only to make a complete collection of them, but also to discover their original meanings. A nation living by the seashore would observe and mimic sounds different from those which would strike the inhabitants of a plain or a mountainous district. In consequence of the limited space at our disposal we are compelled to confine ourselves, on the present occasion, to the investigation of a single tone, not one specially selected because it offers a particularly favourable example\u2014representations of other sounds might have been found which would have served our purpose better\u2014but merely chosen by us because its plain, almost self-evident signification causes it to be easily understood in our own (European) languages also. We allude to the word tik, equivalent to our tick. This word is directly comprehensible to all, irrespective of nationality; the Englishman, Frenchman, German, or Dutchman grasps the full force of its meaning, equally well with the Malay, besides, the expressions tick and tick-tock are well known to us. The Malay says tak, in imitation of the sound produced by striking a small hammer upon a stone-flooring. Now it must be here remarked that, in giving this interpretation, we are quoting from Dewall's large dictionary of the Malay language, where the explanations submitted in tracing the meanings of the various words are so comprehensive and lengthy as to speak well for the care bestowed upon the work. Yet they should not always be accepted without caution, since the possibility of error, occasionally apparent from a less happy choice of illustrations, is not always excluded. Well, in the above instance the Malay employs the work tak, but, when the table is struck with a stick he calls the tone thus produced toek (N. B.\u2014oe\u2014the English oo in poor in this and all the subsequent instances: the oe is the Dutch equivalent for the German u: we catch the difference of tone for it is flatter; hence the use of the oe). The tone in tak (pr: a as in English mar, but somewhat shorter, thus m\u00e4r) is sharper and clearer than in toek. It is a remarkable fact that tik is necessary to\ncomplete the complement of the tripthong, and causing it to take up its natural position between the sharp \u0113 and the oe, should be wanting, at any rate, it does not appear in the lexicon. This omission, however, does not occur in other cases; so, for example, they say soer of the rain falling from trees, also of the cable of an anchor as it glides swiftly through the hawse-hole; again, the word sar stands for water dropped upon hot iron, also for a stream of water forcing its way through an opening, as well as for a mat being drawn along the floor and a spear or javelin flying through a partition consisting of matting; sir (pr: seer) is the name for a pit of elderwood at the moment of its being extinguished by the water coming into contact with it; again, we have poek expressing a feeble explosion or report, such as would be occasioned by the bursting of a cocoa-nut falling from a tree, or an empty pail tumbling upside-down into the water; they apply paek to a book falling on its flat side, or to a table struck with the palm of the hand; pik (pr: peck) is significant of a sound like a wooden box falling on the ground; and so forth. Taking into account the individual effects of s and p, the former indicating a hissing, sibilant sound, and the latter, by virtue of being a labial explodent, expressing the presence of a \"pop\" or \"bang,\" there can be no difficulty in recognizing the part played by the vowel in reproducing a tone to coincide with the original sound.\n\nIn fact, to become fully aware of this distinction, it is almost unnecessary to call in the assistance of such tones, since he who is acquainted with the Malay languages, has it clearly proved to him by numerous examples how the changes in the word indicate the flat, dull, heavy, thick, coarse, and great compared with and opposed to the sharp, clear, light, thin, fine, and small. On a first reference to the Javanese grammar of Roer one will immediately meet with numerous illustrations of this. And, although tik is not found as an independent word in the vocabulary, yet its existence, which made evident by simple analogy, is clearly established beyond the shadow of a doubt, by its derivatives. From all this\n\n* This tripthong occurs in the English why pronounced oo-ah-ee.\nword-tones new words are formed by the addition of the prefixes ke and le, though these words are described as being entirely synonymous with the roots from which they have come; but, if this were perfectly true, these prefixes would either constitute nothing more than phonetic affixes, or independent representations of tone conveying the idea that a more extended and general meaning should be attached to their primitives. In considering the prefix ke, one would, in such a case, have to assume that it merely suggests the sound e which, by being aspirated, had become he, and further that this he has been finally hardened off into ke by aspiration.\n\nNow, as a matter of fact, such an e was originally an intrusion between two consonants inserted for the sole purpose of simplifying the pronunciation, therefore we also meet with it intervening between the final consonant in which the prefix terminates and the initial consonant with which the root opens; for this reason it is often erroneously looked upon as forming a component portion of the root; hence numbers of words are considered to open with an e when such is not the case, and the truth of this assertion becomes apparent when a prefix terminating in a vowel, e.g., di, is substituted for such a one as is closed by a consonant. Presuming we were to accept the above rule for derivation as holding good in the case of tik, tak, toek, we should then feel ourselves compelled to admit that the verbs, minge tik, minge tak, minge toek, were derived from them in the first place and that then, from the further derivative forms of tik, &c., such words as ke tik, &c., had been obtained through the working of some unknown phonetic principle. On account of the close relationship between k and t as initial letters, one might likewise be led to imagine that the form ke tik merely owed its origin to reduplication. In favour of this opinion would be the circumstance that ke very frequently precedes syllables opening with a dental and, though it is often prefixed to other letters as, for instance, in kelip and kilap, this might be accounted for by attributing the circumstance to a transition from the liquid l into the dental d. Consequently, it would be more advisable to consider the k as having originated through reduplication after another manner, viz., to look upon it as proceeding out of the final consonant;\naccordingly, in tik-tik i.e., tik-\u0101-tik it would appear that there has been a suppression of the initial ti. But neither the one or the other of these arguments is satisfactory.\n\nThe other prefix \u0101 is very commonly affixed to tone-words and seems to remind us of the well-known particle lah, but we should certainly experience some trouble in endeavouring to prove them one and the same, even though there were no apparently more correct explanation at our command. At the same time, it cannot be denied that the difficulty, so far as it consists in the fact that la should have lost its fulness of sound, and that, too, in the penultimate, is removed by remembering that the meaning causes the stress to fall on the root, so that la remains unaccented. Yet, notwithstanding this, there is, in our opinion a still better interpretation by which the question may be settled. We have a third form of derivative, the result of a combination of the prefixes k\u0113 and \u0101, found in words like k\u0113t\u0113lik and k\u0113t\u0113loek; these, it is true, are once more described as precisely corresponding in meaning with the other words, but in this instance, at all events, the idea of attributing the construction to the influence of phonetic principles would certainly have but little weight in its favour. Besides, in this species of combination, one very naturally expects to find an intrusive l, in consequence of which k\u0113t\u0113lik would become k\u0113l\u0113lik. In this, as in other languages, the notion conveyed by the vibration of the tongue, viz., that of 'frequency' (not losing sight of the frequent confusion of an r with an l) has, it is quite evident, absolutely no effect upon the quality of the tone; the quantity suffers a change but, the quality remains entirely unaltered. Assuming this to be the correct version, it would be essential that we should, in considering the form \u0101t\u0113lik, acquiesce in the premises that the first term of the word, i.e. the syllable k\u0113, had been suppressed, since it cannot possibly be argued that k\u0113 in k\u0113l\u0113lik is probably a prefiguration to the word \u0101t\u0113lik; for this would certainly not have taken place without some purpose (a phonetic reason is out of the question here), and the very nature of the thing only admits of a modification of the quantity, seeing that the quality is expressed by vowel-change.\n\nAs a consequence of the necessity of supplying a demand\nfor an expression indicative of frequency, durability and combination or connection, there was a call for a special form to render the opposite idea of something disconnected, abrupt, sudden, isolated and unexpected, to be obtained by modification of the word, and thus accounting for the antecedent representation of $k\\bar{e}$ which proceeding, as it were, direct from the throat without interference from the other organs of articulation, was more suitable than any other explodent letter for expressing the suddenness and abruptness of a report or explosive sound when such required rendering by a figure of speech. But, even though it might, in after times, have been possible for $k\\bar{e}$ and $l\\bar{e}$ to be assimilated when nature was no longer the sole guide, yet they originally repelled and excluded each other, and $l\\bar{e}$ could no more be inserted after $k\\bar{e}$ than $k\\bar{e}$ could be made to precede $l\\bar{e}$; besides which, the latter would imply a chronological precedence of $k\\bar{e}$ and such a supposition cannot possibly be entertained or tolerated. The only solution we can, therefore, arrive at is, that we are bound to accept $l\\bar{e}$ as being quite as independent a prefix as $k\\bar{e}$, and that the position of this term $l\\bar{e}$ was assigned to it phonetically after the initial term of the word instead of before it, through metathesis, or transposition. To look upon the prefixes $k\\bar{e}$ and $l\\bar{e}$ as being nothing more than mere phonetic affixes is incorrect, for they evidently define the meaning of the word, in some respect, by modifying the quantity although not affecting the quality.\n\nThere are also instances of $d\\bar{e}$ being found as a meaningless prefix, in which light we shall hardly be able to account for it otherwise than by attributing it to a phonetic change from the $l$ into the dental $d$. This is preferable to the argument that we have here a softened $l$, the consequence of reduplication, for this $d\\bar{e}$ is also found occurring before other consonants.\n\nBy analysing the meanings of tik, tak, toek, it becomes apparent that the principal idea conveyed by the word is represented by the explodent $t$, in exactly the same way as we already noticed of the $s$ and $p$, while the final $k$, with which the above words terminate, merely serves the purpose of abruptly breaking off the tone to imply a sudden ending. Accordingly\nthe chief idea or radical meaning is modified to a degree corresponding with the change the k, is made to undergo. We find this letter supplemented by ng, m, and s, in ting, tang, toeng; tim, tam, toem; tis, tas, toes. Ting signifies the sound produced by a small piece of money falling on a stone, and tang expresses the same thing of a large one, whereas toeng indicates the ringing tone of a bell, or the sound proceeding from a hollow bamboo-cane when the same is struck with a hard weapon. It is our opinion that the fundamental or leading tone suffers no change, the same initial explodent being employed in each case, but the ng indicates prolongation, for the tone is not interrupted or brought to sudden conclusion but continues to vibrate through the nostrils; we fancy we can hear a reverberation in ting and tang quite as plainly as in toeng, hence we have ventured to modify the meanings in some measure, through replacing the stone by a body possessing some vibrative power and capable of emitting a tone; it is true that something hard is requisite in these cases, but it should be a resonant body, for in the above examples it is more likely to be the blow on the stone which it is intended to represent than the chinking of the coin. The resonance here implied is, so to say, passive and confined to the object; replacing this nasal by the labial liquid m there is a further call for the idea, not precisely of a puffing, but rather of a humming or blowing sound; it conveys the notion of an expulsion of air in the performance of which the subject itself is engaged, so that tam and toem, besides indicating a resounding tone, have an extra influence in modifying the meaning. The discharge of a cannon is termed toem, doubtless with the intention of showing that it is accompanied by a hollow, booming sound; tam names a flat, heavy body descending on the ground from above as, e.g., the falling down of the component parts of a house tumbling-in, and the a in the word marks the presence of a rumbling, and crashing noise. The letter s is also concurrent with t in such cases: with the word tas we associate the sound of rattling, snapping, rustling, such as would ensue from the exploding of a percussion cap, or a rifle-ball entering a board or plank, also the cutting of paper with a pair of scissors; toes is the name for a smart, sharp pop or bang, such as one hears on\nfiring a revolver, or when the motion of certain bodies suddenly ceases as, for instance, the surcease of falling drops of water. We fear, however, that these explanations are not quite as correct or as much to the point as might be desired. From the derivatives of *tis* we find that it principally implies the meaning of a continual dripping or falling down, and this sufficiently explains the use of the component letters of a word in which *s* is to be taken more in the light of a continuant than sibilant, and is employed for the special purpose of contrasting with the nasal because there is here no necessity for a letter to express resonance; besides *s* is the only consonant which admits of being used in conjunction with a *t*. Then, again, we know how closely a final *s* approaches the sound of *h* in pronunciation, being deprived of much of its property in losing part of its hissing sound through aspiration.\n\nIt seems that *r* does not appear in concert with *t*, but it occurs in words of the same species, e.g., *gar* and *sar*, where the adoption of *r* is permissible because of the nature of the tone to the meaning of which it adds the impression that the sound of rattling is to be heard; still, considering the various significations of these words, it would not be easy to comprehend them under one common category.\n\nFrom several of these little words new ones are formed by again affixing the self-same prefixes *k\u0113* and *l\u0113* when it often happens that a nasal has been introduced before the *t*, and that *k\u0113l\u0113* also occurs as *k\u0113r\u0113*. Neither of these two modifications is uncommon. It is not necessary to draw the line when one has stated that *l* is confused with *r*, for we so frequently discover a phonetically intrusive *n* in the penultimate of primitive words that, as a rule, the fact of having found the one affords sufficient evidence for assuming the existence of the other.\n\nUntil now, we have merely occupied ourselves with the preliminary or first changes of the root, and have not paid attention to any except the original meanings; a further advance should then be our next step. The dictionary supplies us with active forms for a few of these words, like *toek*, *tas*, *toes*, *tom*, which respectively signify the producing of these radical tones. But there is no reason why verbs from all such words may not\nbe used. It would, moreover, be strange if other derivative forms of these words were not actually in colloquial use. For, correctly speaking, the possible existence of no derivative can be denied, while there is a real demand for the expression of a certain meaning the idea underlying which has an independent form in use, even though present custom may be unacquainted with it, or may have neglected to preserve it, a thing of frequent occurrence. However, such forms did not, at first, come into existence at the same time and together with the roots; it was once considered sufficient, and this sometimes happens even now, simply to mention the word marking the thing which is or does this or that, or the action itself of being or doing, in order to call attention to the subject. By saying tick-tick or tick-tock every one will be reminded of the ticking of a watch or clock. But the man who does not know these articles will think of something else giving forth a similar sound. So it comes that from tik we get the derivative tik tik a drop, and from tis we have menetis to drip, while ketik is the Malay for the ticking, or rather the tick of a clock. After the same manner menetah, transitive, means to hew or chop; menetas, transitive, signifies cutting open, or breaking through for the purpose of disuniting, as in ripping a seam, while the same word, intransitively used, expresses the bursting open of a hatched egg. Then menetoeek names the action of giving a soft or, better still, a muffled knock; menetis is to drip beside anything, also to descend from (with reference to origin); menetik, to flatten by blows, &c. Also menetis, which means to fillip off, as in removing an insect from the hand by a sudden jerk from the tip of the finger, but, it is also used to express the showing of a ring one wears by pushing forward one's finger and thereby performing an action somewhat similar to filliping. The same meaning is ascribed to menetik but this word also means the act of jumping in insects, when it is executed by the stretching out of their hind legs after the manner of a grasshopper, whence the primitive word ketik receives an additional meaning by being used to express a leg of this sort, which is, again, figuratively employed for the hammer of a rifle because a grasshopper's leg more or less resembles it. Allied to ketik is the word keting, the name for that posterior portion of the leg\nsituated between the calf and the heel, while *oerat k\u00ebting* is the term by which the tendon achilles is known, and *m\u00ebng\u00ebting* is only used in the sense of severing or cutting through that particular tendon of a man called the tendon achilles. *Mengatok*, with *a* as its first vowel, signifies tapping on a person's head or striking a flint with a piece of steel; by inserting an *n* in *k\u00ebtang* and repeating the word, thus, *k\u00ebntang*, we get a wooden block struck with a cudgel by the night-watchman as a signal. To these words the following are probably akin in point of origin, *k\u00eblontang*, a scare-crow; *k\u00eblontong*, a pedlar; *k\u00eblinting*, a Chinese pagoda! we fancy this word is also traced as proceeding from a Chinese source); *k\u00ebl\u00ebntingan* and *k\u00ebrentingan*, ear-rings. Many more examples of this kind could be easily found.\n\nWere it our intention to exhaust the subject to which we have been able to do little more than call attention, we should now, without further delay, have to speak of the new change of tone, obvious from the above examples, viz., the contraction of a dissyllable into a monosyllable in the first term of the word, and also the phonetic variation of the consonants which, as in all other languages, is, doubtless, also here originally due to merely dialectic differences, but may, nevertheless, at one time have defined the meaning of the word to some extent. Besides, at the very outset and taking precedence of every other question, the direction of our discourse should now tend towards an enquiry into the laws regulating such tone-words as, in contradistinction to these already considered, we are obliged to term arbitrary in default of being able to think of a more suitable and descriptive expression, one that would define the class better. For, although we have seen that there are words whose origin is traced to involuntary verbal imitation of sound, a still greater number probably owe their existence to caprice, a fact continually remarked in the case of children who habitually render the thing they see, or what they see occurring, by self-coined tones, doubtless very arbitrary, but due to clearly indicated natural causes nevertheless, and for this reason agreeing, now and then, with the equally arbitrary utterances of other children.\nEven previous to making the above enquiries we should proceed to give a more ample description, entering into the details of the antithesis existing between these two great divisions of words. Arbitrary tone-words are, it is quite evident, diametrically opposed to the involuntary, verbal representations of sounds, therefore, when we include the tone-imitative words in the latter class we do so for the express purpose of contrasting them with the arbitrary tone-words, and to show that we look upon them in the light of words with a reflective tendency, not only answering to the sounds themselves but to something more besides, for they recall the very motions and gestures necessary for the accomplishment of the action itself, between which and the sound consequently ensuing there is an intimate relationship: at the period when speech had not reached such a high state of perfection as at present, the language of mimicry and gesticulation must certainly have been of great importance, and that it has not yet taken its final leave of the world we learn from the interesting article by Professor Gerland of Strasburg published in the Deutsche Rundschau for May last (1883), and treating on the language of signs employed by the Indians. In the infant stages of our race, speech was full of motion, the movements of mimicry going hand in hand with the utterance of involuntary expressions for original tones. This is the reason why pronominal roots and radical prepositions have as much right to be considered involuntary, verbal sounds as the tone-imitative words. It is clear that in this instance psychology and grammar do not fulfil precisely the same office. The psyche supplied the material out of which the language was constructed by the nous not in conformity with any logical rules but, starting with the roots of nouns, verbs, pronouns, and prepositions, it developed the language while perfecting itself.\n\nThen, too, we should not be able to avoid a careful investigation of the fundamental meanings belonging to the numerous affixes with which the Malay abounds for, so far, we have only gone into ke and le, and our discourse on these two prefixes has not been by any means complete.\n\nEvidently there is ample material for a prolonged enquiry on untrodden ground.\nIn conclusion we submit the following hypotheses:\n\nThe stocks were derived from imitative and other involuntary sounds, sometimes even preserving, after the first and most prolonged period of their development, traces in their roots of the original primitive wording. Besides, foreign languages have done much to bring about a state of perfection.\n\nIt is not necessary for the roots to have been exclusively monosyllabic. The tone-imitative monosyllables consist, for the most part, of three elements, a consonant, a vowel and a final consonant. When, in compliance with some system, a word becomes deprived of its terminal consonant, it can no longer be considered a true root, all that is left being an abstract tone. If we remove the s from the Malay word tis, we obtain a curtailed form which cannot justly be deemed a real root.\n\nThat differences of surroundings originally gave rise to a corresponding variation in the roots cannot be questioned, yet, considering the uniformity of the psyche and the fact that the ancient races had still always some points in common, these must often have met in their utterances. Hence, to found the assertion that there is a family relationship existing between various branches, on the mere fact of a resemblance in sound between certain roots, would not suffice to place it beyond the pale of dispute.\n\nBut these tone-imitative sounds coupled with those others, whose mutual agreement is a circumstance of far less frequent occurrence, and further combining with them to supply, by means of a portion of every imaginable determinative affix, the entire grammatical and lexicographical store in the word-structure of the language, we say, these two classes of tones, modified after the manner already stated, must certainly have produced an indefinite number of unconnected, independent languages which have, in some measure, long since disappeared.\n\nWe beg leave to conclude this discourse with the above suggestions, and we trust that, provided always they are found to rest upon a sound basis of actual fact, they may be considered to have established a fair claim on the student's attention.\nKLIENG'S WAR-RAID TO THE SKIES.\n\nA DYAK MYTH.\n\nThe Sca Dyaks possess numberless stories, legends and fables handed down by tradition from ancient times. Some are related in plain prose, whilst others are set in a peculiar rhythmical measure, and sung to a monotonous chant, but none are written; all are transmitted by word of mouth from generation to generation. A story plainly told is an \"Ensera,\" and a story sung is a \"Kana.\" One large collection of ensera is similar in character to the stories of Reynard the Fox, whose place in Dyak tale is occupied by the Pelandok and the Kekura (the mouse-deer and the tortoise), who are always represented as acting in concert, and whose united cunning is more than a match for the strength and ferocity of all other animals. Intrigue and stratagem, so abundantly illustrated in these fables are qualities upon which Dyaks love to dwell, and they have an analogous series of stories of the adventures of Apai Samumang and Apai Saloi, two men who are always plotting against each other, the latter however always being outwitted by the former, and then, when occasions serve, not ashamed to practice deceptions upon his own family. Other tales relate the history of Rajas and their dependents in various circumstances, but it may be that these have been borrowed in more recent times from Malay sources. Others describe the exploits of mythical Dyak heroes, and these perhaps constitute the most genuine specimens of the oral literature of the Dyak race. Of this class the following is one, and being generally sung is called a \"Kana.\"\n\nThe greatest hero of Dyak mythical story is Klieng, of whom many exploits are recorded\u2014good and bad, warlike and peaceful. He is supposed to belong to this world of ours, but is not now visible to human eyes as in the good times of yore to which Dyaks look back as the golden age. He is without pedigree. Tradition makes him out to have been found in the\nhard knot of a tree by Ngelai who brought him up as his brother. When of age, he developed a tendency to a wandering life, and never applied himself to any regular pursuit, except those of pleasure and war. He was wayward and capricious, yet handsome and brave; he would often disappear for months and even years at a time, and be given up as dead, and then would re-appear at his mythical home, coming from where no one knew, and no one dared to ask. He had a wonderful power of metamorphosis, and could transform himself into anything, and become monkey or man, tiger or orang-utan; could be ugly or handsome; dirty and diseased, or clean and healthy-looking just as he pleased. On one occasion, it is said, he turned himself into a fragment of a broken water-gourd, and in that disguise was carried by Ngelai in a basket to the battle, when, being set on the ground, he revealed himself in his true character and routed the enemy. In the following adventure, he figures as a man whom we should call a chimney sweep, and is named the \"Smutty One, the Blackened Bambu,\" and it is not until the end of the story that his appearance changes, and he is recognised as Klieng.\n\nHe married Kumang, the Venus of the Dyaks, but in his many wanderings and metamorphoses he became the husband of many others, yet always returned to Kumang in the intervals. And she, following his example, allowed herself the same wide license, and the varying incidents of their constantly securing separations and re-unions make up many a chapter of Dyak story, amusing perhaps, but not very wholesome.\n\nKlieng is not, so far as I know, called Petara; but in Dyak estimation he holds the position of a tutelary spirit, and is sometimes presented with offerings, and often invoked as a helper of men.\n\nThe story of the Ancient Traveller whose coming is unknown.\n\nThe grey-haired Traveller whose way is hidden.\nHis name is \"Bungkok Arok Papong Engkiyong Bujang\" = \"Pengema Ribis Basong.\"\u2020\n\n(*) Literally: \"The Sooty Crooked One, the Charred end of Bambu.\"\n(\u2020) Literally: \"Young Slanting Moon.\" The story represents Klieng as appearing suddenly in his own house; but in disguise, so he is not recognised.\nHe is between Ngelai and Bujang Bulan Menyimbang.\nHe is the Traveller whose cleverness is great.\nWhen he eats rice, at his touch it tastes like chestnut.\nThe remains of his drink tastes like honey of the bee.\n\nNyelai asks him,\u2014\n\u201cWhat, friend, is the object of your visit to our country?\u201d\n\u201cWhat news have you to tell?\u201d\n\nKlieng\u2014None, friend, except that I am weary of pounding rice and fetching water.\n\nNyelai\u2014O you want to get married.\nKlieng\u2014Even so: I wish you to go with me to ask Kumang to marry me.\n\nNyelai\u2014How can you marry whose country is unknown?\nKlieng\u2014My country is the highland of light soil, which touched becomes sago,\nThe Lake Barai, where bathe flocks of birds.\n\nSo they began to cut the knotty branches, as the evening was far enough advanced to begin discussion.\nNgelai arranged his armlets of shell with distinctly cut grooves\u2014\nArranged his plumes of hair like shoots of the young fern\u2014\nArranged his turban like the coil of the black cobra.\nBungkok also arrayed himself: his waist-cloth was of bark,\nHis turban a bit of dried tekulong* bark,\nHis armlets were a twist of rotan.\nThey went to the other end of the woven-walled house,\nWalking after each other keeping step;\nAnd came to the room of Tutong.\n\nTutong\u2014Sit down, friends, on the rotan mat woven by Lemantan of the land of Entigclam.\nSit on the mat woven in sprigs by Lemok called the star-like Lulong.\nEat the pinang just coming into ripeness.\nEat the little pinang gathered from the midst of the fruit trees;\n\n* Owing to my ignorance of botany, I can only, as a rule, give the native names of plants.\nWith spoon-leaf sirih spreading in septiform branches;\nAnd tangled tobacco mossing like the hairy kelindang fern,\nAnd they fell to talking till the morning hours, speaking\nof many things.\n\nTutong\u2014What report, cousin, what news?\nWhat is talked of in the land?\n\nNgelai\u2014We wish to cut into the top of the wide spreading bee-\ntree.\nWe wish to tie the feet of the great wood pigeon,\nAnd net the adong fish at the head of the stream.\nWe ask for Kumang to wed our cousin the Traveller here.\n\nTutong\u2014My sister does not marry anybody.\nI require a man who has found a mosquito's probosis big\nenough for a stanchion of a boat's bow.\nI require one who has found a pangolin's tooth fit for a\nband of the nyabor* sheath.\nBut my speech is that of joke and laugh,\nTalk spoken without thought.\nBut truly I require a man who can lead me to rescue my\nfather and mother from Tedai in the halved deep heavens;\nOne who can lead me to wage war where the dim red sky is\nseen:\nThis is the man whom I seek, whom I search for, to borrow\nas a debt.\n\nKlieng\u2014I am the man, cousin Tutong: if to-night we split\na bunch of ripe pinangs,\u2020 to-morrow we carry war to the\nhalved deep heavens.\nIf we split the red-spathed pinang, I can lead you to wage\nwar to the zenith of the roomy heavens.\n\nSo they agreed to split the pinang: but the elder brother\nof Tutong refused consent; and Ngelai's company returned\ncarrying faces of shame unable to meet the gaze of others:\nwith faces red like a lump of dragon's blood.

Manang\u2014My long house, children, is never tabooed;\nMy short house has no forbidding laws.\nSampurei\u2014How can that house be large enough for us\u2014\nA house of only one door, one family,\nA house of only one row of medang posts?\nI. Manang\u2014Come up, grandson, this my house is large enough\nfor you all.\nUp they went, and not before the army was all inside\nwas the house filled,\nAnd the army rested there.\n\"Let us of the army fetch wood and seek for meat;\" so\nsaid they,\n\nI. Manang\u2014No, no, grandchildren; at all costs, I will give\nyou a meal.\nAnd she filled with rice a pot the size of a chestnut;\nAnd a pot of meat the size of a birds egg.\nSaid Sampurei: \"I will go in, and see grandmother\ncooking.\"\n\nSampurei\u2014Where is the rice which has been cooked, grand-\nmother?\n\nI. Manang\u2014That is it, grandson, only that.\n\nSampurei\u2014Let me swallow it all up and no man know it.\n\nI. Manang\u2014Not so, grandson, let each one fairly have his\nshare: do you go and get leaves.*\n\nAway went Sampurei and fetched some blades of lalang\ngrass.\n\nI.

Manang\u2014How can a man eat with lalang leaves?\n\nSampurei\u2014Don't you know how much a grain of rice is?\n\nI. Manang\u2014Go again and fetch some plantain leaves.\n\nSampurei\u2014I will not weary myself to no purpose:\nWere they required I know how to get alaps:\nAs for rice there is none to be put into the leaves.\n\nAnd grandmother Manang arose, and took rice and\nmeat;\nShe served it out sitting, piling it in heaps as high as\nherself was sitting.\nShe served it out standing, piling it in heaps as high as\nherself was standing.\n\n* When Dyaks have to feed a large company, plates are apt to run\nshort; so they use the large leaves of one or two kinds of trees, as a substi-\ntute.\nI. Manang.\u2014Sampurei, you divide the food; long have men praised your skill in dividing portions.\n\nSampurei\u2014Yes, grandmother. Get ready, all ye of the army.\n\nAnd he took the rice and meat, and tossed it to the left;\nHe tossed it to the right and behind, and sprinkled it about:\nAnd yet not a grain was lost.\nAstonished was grandmother Manang.\n\nI. Manang\u2014In truth you are clever, grandson, skilful with the tips of your fingers.\nBut why do not you eat, Sampurei?\n\nSampurei\u2014Full is the bag made by my mother, the pouch made by my grandmother.\n\nAnd the remainder of the rice left by the army was a matful;\nThe fragments of meat five plates full.\nBut it was all devoured by Lualimban:\nYet still he wanted to eat, wide open was his mouth.\nThey fetched ten pasus of rice, and upset them into his mouth; yet still he wanted more.\nThey got a chest of paddy, and poured it into his mouth, rammed it down with a rod; but yet he was not satisfied.\nAnd he proceeded to eat the gongs big and small and the jars.\nAnd all the goods of grandmother Manang were consumed, and the old lady wept.\n\nKlieng\u2014You have also shown your power, grandmother: so have we:\nBut do not be vexed at heart;\nYour things shall all be restored as before.\n\nAfter their jokes were ended, grandmother Manang departed.\nThe solitary bambu on the highland, the army marched by and was gone.\nThe vanguard came to the hill of \"Jengku Lengan\" like a kembayan fruit in red-ripe bloom,\nThe ridge of trickling rain like the flow of burnt resin.\nIt is the country of young Sabit Bekait Selong Lanchong.\nHis people go with the army, two of them claiming the foremost place:\nTebingkar* Langit Luar, Bujang Bintang Eussiar,\nAnd Kariring Tambak Aping, Bujang Bintang Betating:\nThese with Sampurei and Sapungga marched at the head of the army.\nThey came to the rock of a thousand heights, the land of the cave tiger,\nThe hill of Sandar Sumpit, the land of Ukit Peketan Payang.\n\nKlieng\u2014Which is our way, cousin?\nI know not: hitherto when on the war-path, I have only come as far as this.\n\nAnd Bungkok went forward, and growled like a Melanau building a boat,\nMuttered like a Sebaru men upside down.\nAnd lo! the way at once was clear and straight,\nA highway like the breast of the land turtle.\nThen began a rustling of the cardamom bushes, as the army marched by and was gone.\nThey came to the highland of kelampai copse;\nWhere Tedai hung out to dry the tufted war-plumes;\nTo the level lowland where Chendan shaped the tenyolang\u2020 posts.\nAnd the army stopped there and rested.\nCut down the libas tree in the jungle: who of us will form a company to spy out the land?\n\"I for one,\" said Sampurei Manok Tawei of the manany hawkbells.\n\n* I have not been able to discover the meaning of \"Tebingkar and Kariring.\" There are many words in these ancient songs, whose significance the present generation of Dyaks has lost. Omitting these two terms, the rest stands thus: \"The Wide Heaven, Young Shooting Star, The Aping (kind of palm) Plant, Young Star Constellation.\"\n\u2020 In the festivals to Singa\u2014Burong, high poles are erected in front of the house, bearing on the tops of them carved figures of the rhinoceros hornbill which is called by Dyaks tenyolang.\n\"I for another,\" said Sapungga Bujang Medang.\nKariring was another, Young Aping, the star-cluster youth.\nThese three went forward walking in single file;\nAnd arrived at the house of Pintik Sabang, watcher of\nthe spirits which cannot see.\n\"O that is Sampurei.\" Up they started and flung spears,\nmissing on either side.\nThey fought with swords reaching far over the shoulder.\n\"This is the enemy,\" shouted Sampurei.\nAnd they fought with spears like the thumping of the\nboat-builders.\nThey struck with swords as if cutting through the pandan\nbushes.\nAll day they strove; at night they returned.\n\nThe Army\u2014Well what news bring ye, ye who spy out the land?\n\"We could not find the way;\" they reply.\n\nArmy\u2014In vain we trust to you:\nTalk no more of the clever-speaking maidens.\nCease to think of the pretty girls, as they totter going\nover the tree-stems.\n\nKlieng\u2014Since it is thus, let me be the spy.\nYou go with me, Laja, brother of the virgin Lantan\nSakumbang.\nYou also, Ngelai, Bujang Pedar Umbang.\nLet us three go alone.\n\n\"I go with you,\" said Sampurei, the youth who never\nflags.\nAnd Bungkok rose up, and donned his coat of black hair\nall glistening,\nOver it a cotton padded coat, woven by Bunsu Rembia\nwho rides the flood-tide wave.\nSlowly he walked holding to the wings of the swallow.*\nSwiftly he ran, quicker than the speed of the gazelle.*\n\n* A mystifying contradiction, specimens of which are found in other\nsongs, as when Ini Manang gives this puzzling answer to an inquiry about\ndistance. \"If you start in the morning, you will be a night on the way; if\nyou start in the evening you will get there at once.\" So above, Klieng\nspoke of the same house as long and short.\nAnd arrived at the house of Pintik.\n\nPintik\u2014O that is Sampurei.\n\nKlieng\u2014Will you fight with me?\n\nPintik\u2014Nay, I simply chose to have a bit of play with Sampurei.\n\nAnd they came to the place where people bathe like tumbling prawns.\n\nAnd as the day was now dim, they rested.\n\nLo! there was heard a rattling giggling talk of argus pheasants with shawls red as fire which burns the dry jungle.*\n\nThey came to bathe splashing the water about like showers of falling rain.\n\n\"I smell an odour of Sampurei;\" so said Bunsu Tedai.\n\nKlieng\u2014How can they recognise us?\n\nTedai\u2014If Sampurei be really here, his head shall be cut off on this tree-trunk.\n\n[And Sampurei rose up, and thrust at him a spear.]\n\nTedai\u2014There are gadflies about, the day is closing in.\n\nSampurei\u2014O my mother! the blow of my spear he thought but the sting of a fly!\n\nAnd they came forth and ascended the house when the feasting was at its height.\n\n\"Welcome, cousins; come and sit down.\"\n\nAnd they were given to eat, and were afterwards asked to sing the Pandong song.\u2020\n\nThey were willing; so ran the word.\n\nKlieng\u2014How goes the song? [Whatever your skill \"suggests,\" said they.]\n\nIf so, here it is.\n\n\"Fell the nibong palm to be suspended (in other trees);\"\n\n* Klieng and his friends are now supposed to be near Tedai's house; they lie concealed in ambush in the jungle near his bathing place. The \"argus pheasants,\" are women who come for their ablutions.\n\n\u2020 They come out of their concealment, and proceed to Tedai's house in friends. A festival to Singalang Burong is being celebrated. The \"Pandong\" is a trophy which is erected in the verandah of the house, and upon which are hung shields, spears, war-charms, etc.\n\"Let it fall to the earth in the middle of the road.\n\"Tear and squeeze the heart of Tedai.\n\"Fell the nibong palm to be suspended;\n\"Let it fall to the ground at the end of the bridge.\n\"Tear and squeeze the heart of Chendan.\"\n\nTedai\u2014Why sing you so, cursing our hearts?\nKlieng\u2014We are confused, cousin; our heads are giddy; we will stop.\n\nAnd getting up they climbed to the upper room when they heard weeping and wailing.*\n\n\"O the sorrow of my conception of Indai Mendong, half of the full moon.\n\"I thought she would have won a husband.\n\"Who would shout like a pasunt in the attacking army.\n\"All unripe her father and I shall be used by Tedai (as a sacrifice) to raise the Pandong of the rhinoceros hornbill.\n\"O the vanity of giving birth to Kuing Jawa:\n\"I thought she would have married a man,\n\"Even a dragon-fly, accustomed to rush and strike and sting the ribs (of the enemy).\n\"They cannot rescue her father and me who are to be killed by Tedai to make the war plums.\"\n\nAnd Bungkok seized the iron cage.\nThey cried out, thinking death was near.\n\"It is I,\" said Klieng Bujang Ranggong Tunggang.\n\"It is I,\" said Laja, brother of the virgin Lantan Sakumbang.\n\nAnd they rejoiced in spirit.\nKlieng pressed them into a lump the size of a squirrel:\nHeld in his hand they became as small as a pinang.\nHe stowed them in his quiver, and only when arrived at home did he take them out.\n\n* In the upper part of the house they hear the captive father and mother of Tutong wailing and bemoaning their fate, as destined by Tedai for a forthcoming sacrifice. They are confined in an iron cage.\n\u2020 An animal something like a dog.\nThey descended below,\nThe army had come up, and Chendan knew.\n\"This is the enemy,\" said Tedai; and fled carrying off his wife and children.\nThen they fought with swords and spears, and the followers of Tedai were beaten.\nAnd all who lived there were killed.\nIt was midday, and the army rested.\nSampurei looked round, and lo! half heaven was darkened.\n\nArmy\u2014O what is this?\nKlieng\u2014That is Tedai's army; now shall we have an enemy to fight with.\n\nOf the followers of Tedai were fifty who could fly,\nAnd they fought hand to hand with Sampurei, as if chopping mango fruit.\nThey hurled their spears, as if pounding on the loud-sounding mortars.\nAnd their strength was all spent.\nIn their mouth was the sensation of the poisonous tuba.\nSampurei\u2014More deadly are these enemies, friend, than freshly-dug tuba.\nMore fatal than the parasite-covered upas.\nNever did I fight with foes like these.\n\nForward came one of Tedai's men, Bigul by name;\nBig was the end of his nose; a chempak fruit grew upon it.\nBy breathing against any one, he blew him to the distance of a hill;\nAt each inhalation a man was drawn under his chin.\nBut there was one of the followers of Klieng who could kill him,\nPantak Seragatak his name, who by burrowing could walk underground;\nOut he came and smote Bigul, who died by his hand.\nThen Sampurei came face to face with Tedai,\nAnd was struck by Tedai from the shoulder even to the loins.\nForward rushed Laja, and met the like fate.\nAnd many were slain by Tedai.\nThen for the first time Tedai met Bungkok face to face.\n\nKlieng\u2014What is your title, cousin, when you strike the snake?\nWhat is your title, cousin, when you smite the boa?\n\nTedai\u2014My title, cousin, is the Big Bambu, overshadowing\nthe houses:\nMelanjian, cousin, is another with a branch of red-ripe\nfruit.\n\nKlieng\u2014If you are Big Bambu, cousin, overshadowing the\nhouses, I am Short Sword to cut the Bambu.\nIf you are Melanjian, cousin, I am Growling Bear, making\nmy nest on the Melanjian tree, making it cease to bear\nred-ripe fruit.\n\nAnd Tedai rushed forward and threw at him a spear, the\nbeak of the white kingfisher;\nAnd hurled at him a lance with double-barbed head.\nAnd pierced was Bungkok in the apron of his waist cloth,\nGrazed were the ribs of his side:\nWhen off dropped the disguise covering his body;\nAway fell the sweat-preventing coat.\nThen it was they recognised him to be Klieng, seeing he\nwas handsomer than before.\nAnd Klieng paid back: he aimed at him a spear newly\nhilted with horn.\nAnd Tedai was struck and fell; and was seized by Tatau\nAding.\nHe fell leaning against the palm tree of Bungai Nuying.\n\nKlieng\u2014Tedai's head do not strike off, Sampurei, lest we have\nno more enemies to fight with.\n\nAnd the great army drew back to return.\nRushing and rustling they marched along the highway.\nThey filed through the gloomy jungles, sounding like an\narmy of woodmen:\nThrough solitudes uninhabited, full of weird sounds.\nThose in front arrived at the house of Manang Kedindang Arang.\nThere they stopped a night to inquire the way of grandmother Manang.\n\nI. Manang\u2014The road, grandsons, lies straight ahead from my house.\nSampurei\u2014You are only teasing us, grandmother; we shall kill you.\nI. Manang\u2014Hold, grandsons; I am simply joking and laughing, talking fun with you.\nThen the Manang brought a tub three fathoms long.\nArmy\u2014What is that for, grandmother?\nI. Manang\u2014This, my sons, is to lower you down to the earth.\nSampurei\u2014How can that be large enough?\nI.

Dyaks have a strong tendency to prolixity and circumlocutions, both in their ordinary conversation and in their folk-lore; and delight to use a dozen similes where one would do; and to repeat over and over again the same thing in different words, apparently with the double object of showing the extent of their learning, and to fill up time. This song of Klieng's exploit, if given in full, would take nearly a whole night to sing, especially by a good Dyak rhymist who would amplify it with extemporal additions of his own as he proceeded. Sufficient is here re-produced to show the main points of the story; and to unveil the region of ideas with which Dyaks will amuse themselves in the vacant hours of the night. The singer lies on a mat in the very dim\nlight of the verandah of the house and rehearses the myth in a slow monotonous chant; whilst his audience are sitting or lying around, listening to his periods, and commenting or laughing as the mood suits them.\n\nThese songs of native lore would be more interesting if they contained references throwing light on the former history and condition of the Dyaks; but I have found little of this kind to reward a search through many pages of verbiage. This legend of Klieng's, putting aside the prodigies of it, describes the life and habits of the Dyaks as we now see them: and the only gleam into a different past which it gives is the reference to the sacrifice of human victims, which probably formed a not uncommon element of their religious rites in remoter ages.\n\nI must add that the translation is as literal as I can make it; but I am conscious of how much the peculiar characteristics of the original have been lost in the process. A perpetual play of alliteration and rhyme, and an easy rhythmical flow of the lines are of the essence of all Dyak folk-lore: but I have not been able to re-produce these in the English.\n\nJ.

The King having promised him some 1,200 men, Matelief once more landed with 300 men of his own troops and 800 Malays, fortified a brick house, built a bridge over the river, and took the convent; but a short time afterwards requiring some more Malay troops, and the King having sent him only 200 men, he could not do anything else but try and starve out the town; he landed some more guns to enable his troops, covered by some rough wooden intrenchments, to approach the town gradually, though they were still very much exposed to the fire of the Portuguese Forts St. Domingo, Madre de Deus, St. Jago, and to that of the convent of St. Paulo. In the meantime, the Governor, Andrea Furtado, had been fortunate enough to introduce secretly into the place some people from the neighbourhood, whilst, a short time before our troops had landed, two galleys coming from Pahang, had smuggled into the place a small detachment of 60 European soldiers. On the other hand, many of our troops got sick, partly from overwork and partly from excess in drinking arrack and eating fruit; finally two vessels called the United Countries and the Erasmus coming from the Maas and arriving off Malacca on the 14th July, brought relief to our troops. He now had eleven vessels with him, viz., the Orange, the Middelburg, the Mauritius, the Black Lion, the White Lion, the Great Sun, the Nassau, the Amsterdam, the Small Sun, and the two vessels mentioned as coming from the Maas, and besides these he had seven small vessels. Now and then were sorties made, some from the town, but without any result, neither did our troops make much progress, and there were daily many sick people among them. This lasted till the month of August,\nwhen Mr. Matelief got the news that a strong Portuguese fleet was approaching.\n\nNo sooner had Matelief received that intelligence than he gave orders to move the artillery back again from Camp Kli and to re-embark all the baggage. Five or six days before having made a general inspection of his troops, he found they still numbered 1,200 men, among whom were some 32 wounded and 162 sick. Yet, he sailed with these troops on the 17th August, and about noon fell in with the Portuguese fleet which he fired upon until nightfall. He found that the fleet consisted of 16 heavy galleons, 4 galleys, 1 caravel, and other craft, manned by 3,754 Europeans and about twice as many natives, with which it was intended to conquer Atjeh Malakka, Johor, Pahang, Patani, Bantam and Ambonina.\n\nOn the 18th the Nassau, before she could weigh anchor was boarded by one of the enemy's vessels, whereupon the ship Orange and Middelburg hastened to relieve her; but in the hurry these two very awkwardly contrived to get entangled with each other. \u00c1lvaro Carvalho, the Portuguese Vice Admiral, perceiving this, at once boarded the Middelburg, and the same time Don Enrique de Norinha's galleon boarded the Orange on one side whilst Don Duarte de Guerra's galleon attacked it right forward on the bows.\n\nThe Mauritius, seeing this, went immediately for Don Duarte whereupon a fierce battle ensued, in which the Portuguese as well as our men, fought valiantly.\n\nAt last the Mauritius, set fire to Don Duarte's galleon and thus freed itself, but the Middelburg remaining entangled with \u00c1lvaro Carvalho's and Don Duarte's galleons, all these three vessels were destroyed by fire, though most of the crew of the Middelburg were rescued. \u00c1lvaro Carvalho and 40 or 50 of his crew, who tried to save themselves in one of the boats of the Middelburg, were all killed by the crew of the Orange; even Carvalho was not spared, though Matelief did his utmost to rescue him. Matelief, who with his vessel the Orange had boarded Don Enrique de Norinha's galleon and had possessed himself of her two flags, summoned him to haul down and to surrender. Norinha, lowering his last flag conveyed the impression that he was about to surrender, and\nby dint of this stratagem, escaped out of the hands of his enemies. However, his galleon had been riddled by cannon-balls and he had lost the greater part of his crew.\n\nThe Nassau was set on fire by her two Portuguese assailants, but her whole crew were rescued, save six men who had been killed in the action. We lost in this engagement off Cabo Rachado, 2 vessels, 24 men killed, and a great many wounded.\n\nThe Portuguese too lost 2 vessels, but they had about five or six hundred men killed, amongst whom were the following nobles, heads and captains of the navy, viz.:\u2014Vice-Admiral \u00c1lvaro Carvalho and Fernando da Silva, his relation; Duarte de Guerra, captain of a galleon; Diego Ortez da Favorra, Don Manuel Mascarenhas, Manuel d'Albukerke, Sebastiaan di Mirandi, Antonio di Silveira, Don Enrique de Castro, Manuel de Mello and also two Spanish Dons on board of the Viceroy's vessel. But for the rowing galleys, their loss would have been heavier still, for, assisted by those vessels, they were able to move about even in a dead calm.\n\nMatelief resolved on the 19th to attack the fleet again; weighed anchor on the 20th and got engaged on the 22nd with almost all his vessels, viz., the Orange, Mauritius, Witte Leeuw (White Lion), Zwarte Leeuw (Black Lion), Erasmus and the Groote Son (Great Sun).\n\nBut as the enemy continually retreated, our vessels were unable to do them much damage.\n\nDuring the night of the 24th the Portuguese fleet changing its tactics, made for ours very suddenly. This produced a panic amongst our people at first, the more so as it was night more or less and thus our vessels got very much separated from each other. Soon after, however, they joined company again, and all running before the wind, the enemy had to give up the pursuit, and returned to Malacca. With regard to the Portuguese commanders and captains of the navy and the size of their vessels, I have found a record of the following, viz.:\n\nDon Paulo de Portugal's ship of 1000 tons. [ral's vessel.]\nDon Martin d'Alphonso \" 1100 \" (The Vice-Admi-\nDon Pedro Marenam \" 800 \"\nSebastiaan Soarez 700\nDon Francisco de Norinha 700\nDon Francisco de Sotomajor 700\nAntonio de Souza Furtun 500\n\nBesides 3 galleys and 12 barges.\n\nThe names and tonnage of those of our vessels which still left are the following, viz.:\n\nThe Orange of 700 tons (the Admiral's vessel.)\nGroote Son (Great Sun) of 500 tons\nErasmus 600\nVereenigde Landen (United Countries.) 500\nMauritius 700\nAmsterdam 800\nSwarte Leeuw (Black Lion) 600\nWitte Leeuw (White Lion) 600\nKleine Son (Small Sun) 200\n\nWith these vessels, Mr. Matelief sailed to Djohor the 24th of August, and the next day he lost sight of the Portuguese fleet, which returned to Malacca. On the 1st September, he entered the river of Djohor where they came to meet him and welcomed him.\n\nMr. Matelief sailed on the 18th ditto to Batu Sawar to settle several urgent matters, among which the chief was hurry on the King to fortify his town (which could be done, if the Malays would but work); secondly to send his fleet with provisions; in the third place to bid the King to send some prahus to Atsjien and Malakka, to see whether Dutch vessels had arrived there, and finally whether gunpowder could be got somewhere. But the Malays wanted us to fortify their town, and gunpowder of the worst quality was not to be had for love or money. So Mr. Matelief discovered, that it was simply a waste of time to have any more dealings with this King and his Malays.\n\nBatu Sawar is a town situated 5 or 6 miles up the river of Djohor, which is at that place very beautiful, broad, deep, and has therefore a supply of fresh water. The\npart of the country is low, and the houses are built on piles along the river. There are two fortresses\u2014one called Batu Sawar, one Kota di Sabrang.\n\nBatu Sawar is about 1,300 paces in circumference, almost square, and is fortified with palisades 40 feet high, standing close together; it is further provided with some interior outworks. It is built on level ground, close to the river, a quarter of an hour's walk from the nearest hills, and the river could easily be conducted to the place. Inside, it is thickly inhabited and filled with attap houses; but those of the King and some of the courtiers are built of wood. Kota Sabrang is about four or five hundred paces in circumference and also is almost square. There are about three or four thousand men able to bear arms within Batu Sawar and Kota Sabrang, though most of the people live outside the fortress. The whole of the land belongs to the King but that does not matter much, for if people apply for it, they can get as much as they like; it looks very fertile and abounding in trees. Admiral Matelief gave the King several plans and good suggestions for the fortification of the place, but the Malays were too indolent to work. Hence, perceiving that it was beyond his means to conquer Malacca just then, and that thereby the first clause of the recently concluded treaty became void, Matelief begged the King to grant the Dutch a place for their residence. The King gave him permission to choose any place in the country that he liked, provided, however, that he should be bound to fulfil the other articles of the treaty.\n\nThe King on the other hand solicited of Matelief a piece of land in Malacca when it should have been taken, which was granted to him on proper terms. This however looked very much like selling the skin of the bear, before it had been caught. The prince furthermore asked for the loan of some hundreds of rix dollars, nay even one thousand, which sum he would repay in such goods as we might wish, promising at the same time that he would not ask for any more money, until the first loan was repaid. Secondly he demanded that the Ministers of the States should assist him against all his enemies, either on the offensive or the defensive, and finally that, on his request,\nthey should assist him also with ships, troops, guns, etc., and that Matelief should remain there with his fleet until the arrival from Holland of the other vessels. Mr. Matelief replied to the King that a thousand rix dollars did not matter much to the Dutch, and that, as he (Mr. Matelief) did not care to have that amount mentioned in a treaty which he had to conclude for the Ministers of the States he would give it to him from his own private funds provided that the prince would allow him and his countrymen to trade in the country. So the prince withdrew this first clause. As for the second clause, Matelief said that, the Ministers of the States not being in the habit of declaring war unrighteously, they could only promise to defend him against his enemies, but, as for acting on the offensive, they would never join him against any other power than the Portuguese. And with regard to the third clause, he said that our vessels, etc., should always be at his service. The King then pointed out to our people a piece of land 30 fathoms square. Mr. Matelief was very much astonished at this, and told him, that though it would do for the present, we should by and by require a much larger place for our trade in his country.\n\nWhen the King requested him to remain there until the arrival of other vessels, Matelief convinced him that it was not in his power, as two vessels had to go to Holland in December, but that he would certainly remain there till December, so as to protect him as long as possible.\n\nThereupon this second and subsequent treaty was signed in Batu Sawar on the 23rd of September. It seems that about this time Don Andrea Furtado de Mendoza was succeeded as Governor of Malakka by one Don Antonio de Meneses, a son of Don Duarte de Meneses, late Viceroy of India, but he did not feel inclined to accept the Governorship unless the Viceroy first made peace with the king of Djohor.\n\nOur Admiral having received the news that several store-ships, sailing under convoy of some Portuguese men-of-war, were on their way to Malakka, left Djohor on 17th October with the intention of attacking this convoy.\n\nArriving near Malakka he counted 7 vessels, viz., the Vice-\nRoy's vessel, called La Conception, the best armed of all the vessels and commanded by Captain Don Manuel de Mascarenhas; the galleon St. Nicolas, with 19 brass and 5 iron guns, under the command of Don Fernando de Mascarenhas, who had his brother Don Pedro with him; the St. Simoon, Captain Andrea Peso; the Todos os Santos, Captain Don Francisco de Norinha; the Santa Cruz, under the command of Vice-Admiral Sebastian Soares; then another one, the largest of all the vessels, with Don Paulo de Portugal as Captain and one more, much smaller, the St. Antonio, Captain Antonio de Souza Falcao.\n\nBy order of our Admiral, the vessels Oranje, Groote Son and Vereenigde Landen were to attack jointly one of the Portuguese vessels; whilst our other vessels had to prevent the enemy from coming near. They thereupon resolved to attack in the night of the 21st the Portuguese Vice-Admiral's vessel, but a calm compelled them to postpone it till the next day.\n\nOn the morning of the 22nd he attacked the enemy in the roads, and captured the St. Nicolas, which could not be prevented by the Viceroy; but by the carelessness of our people this ship got free again, though Mr. Matelief had already given orders to set fire to her.\n\nIn the meantime, the Groote Son, Swarte Leeuw and Mauritius had boarded the St. Simoon and after having captured her they burnt her with her whole crew. The Erasmus attacked the Santa Cruz, but was at first beaten back; the Mauritius then coming to her assistance, they jointly captured the said vessel, a fine galleon of 11 brass and 4 iron guns.\n\nAmong the many Portuguese nobles who fell in this battle, were Don Fernando de Mascarenhas, Captain of the St. Nicolas, and his brother Don Pedro; Don Francisco de Norinha, Captain of the Todos os Santos; Bartholome de Fonseca, Jorge Galvan and Don Pedro de Mascarenhas son of Don Geronimo de Mascarenhas. Altogether they lost 521 Europeans, and on the 23rd our people captured another galleon, the St. Simoon, in which they seized 11 brass and 2 iron guns, 3,000 lbs of gunpowder, and a great quantity of wine and provisions.\nWe took in this battle 4 galleons, almost without a loss worth mentioning; the only deplorable casualty that happened being, that 75 men of our people (among whom were Klaas Janssoon Melknap, skipper of the Wilte Leeuw, the supercargo Jaques de Colenaar, and the subfactor Hans van Hagen) who went on board the Santa Cruz with the intention of plundering, were blown up in her and perished miserably.\n\nThree more ships of the enemy which ran aground were destroyed by fire.\n\nThe whole fleet of this Viceroy Don Martin Alfonso de Castro (youngest son of Don Antonio de Cascais) which had arrived only the year before, consisted of 18 galleons, 4 galleys, 1 caravel and 23 barges, manned by 3,700 Europeans, of whom 2,954 were soldiers and 750 sailors, besides the black crews who numbered many more; and it was with this fleet and these troops that he intended to conquer the whole of Southern India and to punish all the refractory princes and States.\n\nThe following are the names and particulars of the vessels of the said fleet:\n\n1st\u2014The Nossa Senhora de Concepcion of 1,000 tons, Captain Manuel de Mascarenhas, with 24 guns and 180 European soldiers, besides a number of European and black sailors. On the 29th of October this galleon was destroyed by fire off Malakka, either by Matelief or by the Viceroy himself for fear that we should do it.\n\n2nd\u2014The San Salvador of 900 tons, Captain Alvares de Carvalho, with 18 guns and 180 European soldiers, besides the European and black sailors. Mr. Matelief burnt this galleon on the 18th of August off Cabo Rachado.\n\n3rd\u2014The San Nicolas of 800 tons, Captain Don Fernando de Mascarenhas, with 19 brass and 3 iron guns and 180 soldiers; Mr. Matelief defeated this galleon off Malakka on 22nd October, in which engagement a\nthe crew excepting 8 men were killed. The Viceroy himself ordered her to be destroyed by fire on 29th October.\n\n4th\u2014The galleon of Don Enrique de Norinha, of 900 tons, 14 brass guns and 160 soldiers, captured by Matelief off Cabo Rachado on the 18th of August.\n\n5th\u2014The Santa Cruz of 600 tons, Captain Sebastian Soarez, with 10 brass guns and 80 European soldiers, it was plundered and burnt by Matelief off Malakka on 22nd October.\n\n6th\u2014The San Simoon of 900 tons, Captain Don Francisco de Sotomajor, with 16 brass and 2 iron guns and 160 European soldiers. This was taken, plundered and destroyed by fire off Malakka on 23rd of October.\n\n7th\u2014The Todos os Santos of 800 tons, Captain Don Francisco de Norinha with 130 soldiers, this vessel was sunk with her whole crew.\n\n8th\u2014Don Duarte de Guerra's galleon, of 1,000 tons, with 15 brass guns and 108 European soldiers, destroyed by fire off Cabo Rachado on the 16th of August.\n\n9th\u2014The Nossa Senhora de Soccoro of 800 tons, Captain Gutierre de Monroy, with 15 brass guns and 140 European soldiers.\n\n10th\u2014The Don Antonio of 240 tons, Captain Antonio de Souza Falcaon, with 10 brass guns and 47 European soldiers; she caught fire off Malakka on 29th October.\n\n11th\u2014The Nossa Senhora das Merc\u00eas of 800 tons, Captain Don Alvaro de Menesez, with 14 guns and 120 European soldiers.\n\n12th\u2014The galleon of Jacomo de Marais Sarmento of 800 tons, 14 brass guns and 80 European soldiers.\n\n13th\u2014Jan Pinto de Morais' galleon of 800 tons, with 15 brass pieces and 140 European soldiers.\n\n14th\u2014Jeronimo Botelho's galleon of 300 tons, with 12 brass guns and 100 European soldiers.\n15th\u2014Manuel Baretto's galleon of 500 tons, with brass guns and 100 European soldiers.\n\n16th\u2014The San Martinho of 800 tons, Captain Don Lono, with 22 brass guns and 150 European soldiers. This was lost off Masar in Ceylon.\n\n17th\u2014Captain Don Paulo de Portugal's galleon of 1,200 tons with 1,200 guns. This had no soldiers but many merchants and passengers bound for China. The Viceroy destroyed this vessel off Malakka on October.\n\n18th\u2014The galleon of Captain Don Antonio de Melo (now Governor of Malakka). This vessel too had no soldiers but many merchants and passengers bound for China but was lost off Cape Comorin.\n\nOne of the four great royal galleys was very badly damaged off Cabo Rachado; 854 European soldiers, besides a great number of sailors and rowers were on board of the said four galleons and twenty-three barges.\n\nIn short nine out of these eighteen galleons were lost; a very heavy loss indeed for the Portuguese, who had had the presumption to think of subduing the whole of India, with their fleet, whereas this siege of Malakka by Matelief cost about 6,000 men.\n\nMatelief sent word to the Viceroy offering to set at liberty all Portuguese prisoners in exchange for all Dutch prisoners.\n\nHe merely requested a ransom for the Portuguese of extraction, to which the Viceroy made objections; upon which Mr. Matelief sent him word, that, if the Hollanders (numbering but four or five) were not set at liberty that very day, he would early next morning, issue an order to throw overboard about two hundred Portuguese prisoners, adding at the same time, that probably Don Andrea Furtado had given (the Viceroy) such unreasonable advice, so as to make him despised by the whole world.\n\nIt was decided by our people that a ransom of 6,000 crowns should be paid for the following prisoners, viz.:\u2014Andrea...\nSOA and Sebastiaan Soarez (both captains of galleons), then two cousins of Soarez, then Joan Bravo who commanded the galleon of Don Antonio de Meneses, the Governor of Malakka, then one Don Fernando del Mercado, a merchant and finally a priest.\n\nAdmiral Matelief was not pleased with this decision, for he did not like to introduce the practice of ransoming men into India, but it was carried by a majority of votes, under pretext, that this ransom, when distributed among the sailors, would make them in the future more willing to fight.\n\nWhen up to the 28th of October not one Hollander had yet come back, Matelief convoked an extraordinary meeting of the Council to reconsider the question of throwing the Portuguese overboard; but whilst they were still deliberating, two prahus approached our vessels containing three Dutchmen, who declared that there were really no more Hollanders here in Malakka, but that there were still four or five more in the fleet off the Nicobar islands. Whereupon the Portuguese were liberated and landed on the 1st of November. One Don Rodrigo d'Acosta having agreed to take a letter to the Viceroy of India in which he was requested to set at liberty and to send to Djohor all the Hollanders who were still prisoners in India, our Admiral gave him a passport for a whole year.\n\nAbout this time (the 12th November) Mr. Matelief ordered the ship Kleine Son to take back the ambassador whom the Prince of Keidah had sent to him to invoke his assistance against the Portuguese, whilst he (the Prince) should attack them by land. Though Matelief knew that this same Prince had welcomed the Portuguese when they passed his country and that he only came because he (Matelief) had beaten the Portuguese, still he promised him his assistance.\n\nHe first despatched thither the Amsterdam with the supercargo Jasper Jansoon, arriving himself on the 19th before Keidah. The King having warned him on the 24th that there were two boats in the river filled with Portuguese and black soldiers, Matelief despatched thither one galley and one barge under the orders of Pieter van der Dussen who soon returned with only five Portuguese, who had left Malacca thirteen days\nbefore and had been chased by Malay pirates.\n\nMatelief finding that this little King was deadly afraid of the Portuguese and that his help would not be of any value, left the place again on the 27th. Super-cargo Cornelis Franci, who was factor at Djohor in 1607, behaved so ill in September of that year, that Fiscal Apins was at a loss what to do. When Matelief, on his arrival off the river of Pahang on 11th November, 1607, heard from the King that both the Viceroy of India and the Governor of Malakka had died, he decided not to stop long and sailed from there on 16th.\n\nFiscal Martinus Apins left Djohor that year and informed Matelief that if no vessels came for the relief of Djohor, the King would certainly make peace with the Portuguese.\n\nIn December, he had also heard at Bantam that the Portuguese had destroyed Djohor by fire and that Rajah Sabrang, who lived at Lingga, was strengthening himself at that place. Abraham van den Broek was super-cargo of our Company at Djohor in December, 1608; a month previously our people had captured, off Malakka, a Portuguese carrack. When in January, 1609, Admiral Pieter Willemsoo Verhooven was at Djohor, he thought proper to give Van den Broek the command of the vessel De Roode Leeuw and to put in his place super-cargo Jacques Obelaar, together with the secunde or sub-factor Abraham Willemsoo de Ryk, the connoisseur in diamonds Hector Roos, with three assistants and some other people; at the same time he ordered the Roode Leeuw and the yacht Griffioen to anchor at the mouth of the river until the 1st of July, in order to protect the King against the Portuguese. Such was the course of things here in the reign of king Alawaddin III, who died in 1610.\n\nHe was succeeded in the same year by Sulthan Abdullah Sjah, who was the 17th Malay king, the 5th of Djohor, and the 11th Mohamedan king. This king reigned eleven years over this people, from 1610 to 1621, and but very few events of importance happened during his Government.\n\nIn 1616 he was reputed for being attached to us more than any other Indian Prince, for which reason he and his country had to suffer very much from our mutual enemy.\n\nHe was succeeded in 1621 by Sulthan Mahmood Sjah, the\n18th Malay king, 6th of Johor and 12th Mohamedan king. He reigned but three years, and was then succeeded in 1624 by Sultan Abduljalil Sjah II, who sent the princes Rajah Indra Lellah and Magat Manchur as ambassadors to Holland.\n\nHe was the 19th Malay king, the 7th of Johor and the 13th Mohamedan king, and reigned 47 years, viz., from 1624 to 1671.\n\nIt appears that during his reign the Empire of Maningcabo was subject to his authority. Our Company tried over and over again to build a fortress there (Admiral Verhoeven being the first one who did so), but they never would allow it.\n\nThough our first attempt to conquer Malakka (made under Admiral Matelief in 1606) had proved unsuccessful, our Company, still hoping to be some day the rulers at that place, constantly gave their thoughts to it. The seventeen Directors* had previously given orders in 1623, to besiege Malakka again, but nothing could then be done.\n\n---\n\n*The Board of administration of the Dutch E. I. Company consisted of 17 deputies, three of which were elected by Amsterdam.\u2014The Translator.\nON MINES AND MINERS IN KINTA, P\u00caRAK.\n\nThe valley of the Kinta is, and has been for a very long time essentially a mining country. There are in the district nearly five hundred registered mines, of which three are worked by European Companies, the rest being either private mines, i.e., mines claimed by Malays, which have been worked by them and their ancestors for an indefinite period, or new mines, in other words new concessions given indifferently on application to Malays and Chinese. There are about three hundred and fifty private Malay mines, and it is with these principally that the following paper will deal.\n\nSo far, no lodes have been discovered in Kinta; it is, however, probable that, as the country is opened up and prospectors get up amongst the spurs of the main range, the sources of the stream tin will come to light.\n\nMining in Kinta, like mining in Larut, is for stream tin, and this is found literally everywhere in Kinta; it is washed out of the sand in the river beds\u2014a very favourite employment with Mandheling women; Kinta natives do not affect it much, although there is more than one stream where a good worker can earn a dollar per day; it is mined for in the valley, and sluiced for on the sides of hills; and lastly, a very suggestive fact to a geologist, it has been found on the tops of isolated limestone bluffs and in the caves* which some of them contain.\n\nThis stream tin has probably been worked for several centuries in Kinta; local tradition says that a very long time ago Siamese were the principal miners and there is evidence that\n\n* Report on the geology and physical geography of the State of Perak, by Revd. J. E. Tennison-Wood, F.G.S., F.L.S., &c.\nvery extensive work has been done here by somebody time when the method was different from that which is commonly adopted by Kinta Malays at the present day. There are at least fifty deep well-like pits on the Lahat hill, aging about eight feet in diameter and perhaps twenty deep.\n\nFurther up country, I have seen a large pit which they called a Siamese mine; this is about fifty feet in diameter over twenty feet deep and its age may be conjectured from the virgin forest in which it is situated. Besides these, at places extensive workings are continually brought to light as the country is opened up, and these appear to have been undisturbed for at least a hundred years. Further evidence of old work is furnished by slabs of tin of a shape that which has been used in Perak in the memory of persons; and only a few weeks ago two very perfect \"stones\" of an unusual shape and particularly sharp were found at a depth of eight feet in natural drift. They may, perhaps, have been used to grind grain.\n\nSo peculiarly is Kinta a mining district, that even Sakais of the hills do a little mining to get some tin wherewith to buy the choppers and sarongs which the Malays sell to them at an exorbitant price.\n\nThe Malay pawang or medicine-man is probably the inheritor of various remnants and traditions of the religion which preceded Muhammadanism, and in the olden time the profession derived a very fair revenue from the exercise of their profession, in propitiating and scaring those spirits who have to do with mines and miners; even now, although the Malay pawang may squeeze a hundred or perhaps two hundred dollars out of the Chinese towkay who comes to mine in Malaya, the money is not perhaps badly invested, for a Chinaman is no prospector, whereas a good Malay pawang has a wonderful 'nose' for tin, and it may be assumed that the Chinese towkay and, before his time, the Malay miner, did not pay a tax to the pawang, unless they had some ground for believing that, by employing him and working under his guidance there would be more chance of success than if they worked only on their own responsibility.\nThe pawang being a person who claims to have powers of divination and other imperfectly understood attributes, endeavours to shroud his whole profession in more or less of mystery. In his vocabulary, as in that of the gutta-hunters, special terms are used to signify particular objects, the use of the ordinary words being dropped; this is called \"bahasa pantang.\"\n\nThe following are some of the special terms alluded to:\n\nHer-olak tinggi, instead of gunak\u2014elephant. The elephant is not allowed on the mine, or must not be brought on to the actual works, for fear of damage to the numerous races and dams; to name him, therefore, would displease the spirits (hantu).\n\nBer-olak dapar, instead of kuching\u2014cat. Cats are not allowed on mines, nor may the name be mentioned.\n\nA tiger of enormous size called Her-olak is said to haunt Kinta. The legend about him is as follows:\u2014A long time ago, in the pre-Muhammadan days, a man caught a tiger kitten and took it home; it grew up quite tame and lived with the man until he died, when it returned to the jungle and grew to an enormous size, nine cubits (hasta) long, it is still there, though nobody ever sees it, it does no harm, but sometimes very large tracks are seen and men hear its roar, which is so loud that it can be heard from Ch\u00e9mor to Batu Gajah; when heard in the dry season, it is a sure prognostication of rain in fifteen days' time.\n\nSial, instead of kerbau\u2014water-buffalo. The buffalo is not allowed on the mine for the same reason as the elephant.\n\nSalak nama, instead of limau nipis\u2014lime (fruit). If limes are brought on to a mine, the hantu (spirits) are said to be offended, the particular feature of the fruit which is distasteful appears to be its acidity. It is peculiar that Chinese have this superstition concerning limes as well as Malays; not very long ago a Chinese towkay of a mine complained that the men of a rival konysi had brought limes and squeezed the juice into his head race, and furthermore had rubbed their bodies with the juice mixed with water out of his head race, and he said they had committed a very grave offence, and asked that they might be punished for it.\nWith Malays this appears to be one of the most important \"pantang\" rules, and to such a length is it carried that \"belachan\" (shrimp-paste) is not allowed to be brought on to a mine for fear it should induce people to bring limes as well, lime juice being a necessary adjunct to belachan when prepared for eating.\n\nEuah rumput or bunga rumput, instead of biji\u2014tin sand.\nAkar or Akar hidop, instead of ular\u2014snake.\nKunyit instead of lipan\u2014centipede.\nBatu puteh instead of timah.\u2014metallic tin.\n\nIt is important that the 'Pawang' should be a marked man as to personal appearance; for this reason there are certain positions of the body which may be assumed by him only when on the mine; these attitudes are,\u2014first, standing with the hands clasped behind the back, and secondly with the hands resting on the hips; this second position is assumed when he is engaged in invoking the \"spirits\" of a mine; the pawang takes his station in front of the genggulang, having a long piece of white cloth in his right hand, which he waves backwards and forwards over his shoulder three times, each time calling the special hantu whom he wishes to propitiate, by name; whilst engaged in this invocation his left hand rests on his hip. During the performance of any professional duty he is also invariably dressed in a black coat, this nobody but the pawang is allowed to wear on a mine. These attitudes and the black coat comprise what is technically termed the pakei pawang.\n\nThe professional duty of the pawang of a mine consists in carrying out certain ceremonies, for which he is entitled to collect the customary fees, and in enforcing certain rules for the breach of which he levies the customary fines.*\n\n* About 1878, the principal pawang of the Larut district, one Pa'tam Dam, applied to me as Assistant-Resident to reinstate him in the duties and privileges which he had enjoyed under the Orang Kaya Mantri and, before him, under Che Long J'Affab. He described the customary ceremonies and dues to be as fol-\nAt the time of the opening of a mine he has to erect a *geng-gulang* and to call upon the tutelary *hantu* of the locality to assist in the enterprise. The fee for this is one bag (*karong*) of tin sand.\n\nAt the request of the miners, instead of a *geng-gulang*, a *kapala nasi* may be erected, as cheaper and more expeditious. The fee is one *gantang* of tin sand.\n\nHe also assists in the ceremony of hanging the *ancha* in the smelting house, his principal associate in this is the \"Panglima Klian,\" who draws the *ancha* up to its proper position close under the attaps.\n\n1. Raw cotton must not be brought on to a mine in any shape, either in its native state or as stuffing of bolsters or\n\nlows:\u2014He had to visit all the mines from time to time especially those from which tin ore was being removed; if the daily out-put of tin suddenly decreased on any mine it was his business at once to repeat certain invocations (*puja*) to induce the tin-ore to remain (*handak di-pulih balik sapaya jangan mengorang biji*). Once in every two or three years it was necessary to carry out an important ceremony (*puja besar*) which involved the slaying of three buffaloes and a great feast, the expense of which had to be borne by the *pauwang*. On the day of the *puja besar* strict abstinence from work was enjoined on every one in the district, no one might break ground or even pull up weeds or cut wood in the whole province. Further, no stranger whose home was three days' journey away, might enter one of the mines under a penalty of twenty-five dollars.\n\nThe *pauwang* was entitled to exact from the owners of mines a customary payment of one slab of tin (or $6.25 in cash) per annum for every sluice-box (*palong*) in work during the year.\n\nIn any mine from which the tin-ore had not yet been removed it was strictly forbidden to wear shoes or to carry an umbrella; no Malay might wear a sarong.\n\nThe Chinese miners, always superstitiously disposed, used (under Malay rule) to adhere to these rules and submit to these exactions but since 1875 the *pauwang* has found his occupation and income, in L\u00e2rut at all events, gone.\n\nEd.\nmattresses. The fine (hukum pawang) is $12.50; the ordinary pillow used by a miner is made of some soft wood.\n\n2. Black coats and the attitudes designated pakei pi-\nwang may not be assumed by any one on the mine with the\nexception of the pawang. (Hukum pawang, $12.50.)\n\n3. The gourd used as a water vessel by Malays, all de-\nscriptions of earthenware, glass and all sorts of limes and\nlemons and the outer husk of the cocoa-nut are prohibited\narticles on mines. (Hukum pawang, $12.50.)\n\nNote.\u2014All eating and drinking vessels should be made of\ncocoa-nut shell or of wood, the noise made by earthen-\nware and glass is said to be offensive to the hantu.\nBut in the case of a breach of this regulation the\npawang would warn the offenders two or three times\nbefore he claimed the fine.\n\n4. Gambling and quarrelling are strictly forbidden on\nmines, the fine is claimed for the first offence. (Hukum\npawang, $12.50.)\n\n5. Wooden aqueducts (palong) must be prepared in the\njungle a long way from the mine. (Hukum pawang, $12.50.)\n\nThe noise of the chopping is said to be offensive to the\nhantu.\n\n6. Any breach of the bahasa pantang is an offence. (Hu-\nkum pawang, $12.50.)\n\n7. Charcoal must not be allowed to fall into the races.\n(Hukum pawang, $12.50.)\n\n8. A miner must not wear, and go to work on the mine\nin, another man's trousers. (Hukum pawang, one karong of tin\nsand.)\n\nNote.\u2014This applies only to the senur seluar basah, or work-\ning dress. It is also an offence to work in the\ngarment called sarong.\n\n9. If the chupak (measure) of the mine is broken, it must\nbe renewed within three days. (Hukum pawang, one bhara\nof tin.)\n10. No weapon may be brought within the four posts of the smelting house which immediately surround the furnace. *(Hukum pawang, \u00a71.25.)*\n\n11. Coats may not be worn within this space. *(Hukum pawang, \u00a71.25.)*\n\n12. These posts may not be cut or hacked. *(Hukum pawang, one slab of tin.)*\n\n13. If a miner returns from work, *bringing back with him some tin sand,* and discovers that somebody has eaten the cold rice which he had left at home, he may claim from the delinquent one *karong* of tin sand. The *pawang* adjudicates in the matter.\n\n14. An earthenware pot (*pniok*) which is broken must be replaced within three days. *(Hukum pawang, one karong of tin sand.)*\n\n15. No one may cross a race in which a miner is sluicing without going some distance *above* him, up stream; if he does he incurs a penalty of as much tin sand as the race contains at the moment, payable to the owner of the race. The *pawang* adjudicates.\n\n16. A *kris*, or spear, at a mine, if without a sheath, must be carefully wrapped in leaves, even the metal setting (*simpei*) must be hidden. Spears may only be carried at the \"trail.\" *(Hukum pawang, uncertain.)*\n\n17. On the death of any miner, each of his comrades on that mine pays to the *pawang* one *chupak* (*penjuru*) of tin sand.\n\nIt will be noticed that the amount of the majority of these fines is $12.50; this is half of the amount of the fine which, under the Malay customary land, a chief could impose on a *ra'iyat* for minor offences. It is also the amount of the customary dowry in the case of a marriage with a slave or with the widow or divorced wife of a *ra'iyat*.\n\nThe Malay miner has peculiar ideas about tin and its properties: in the first instance he believes that it is under the protection and command of certain spirits whom he considers it necessary to propitiate; next he considers that the tin itself\nis alive and has many of the properties of living matter, that of its own volition it can move from place to place, that it can reproduce itself, and that it has special likes\u2014or perhaps affinities\u2014for certain people and things and vice-versa. Hence it is advisable to treat tin-ore with a certain amount of respect, to consult its convenience, and what is, perhaps, more curious, to conduct the business of mining in such a way that the tin ore may, as it were, be obtained without its own knowledge!\n\nI append a vocabulary consisting of a few Malay words which are more particularly connected with mines and miners. The language is so susceptible of change that, unless a record is kept of such terms, they may, perhaps as the method of working alter, be entirely lost. As it is, I imagine that the majority of these words and expressions (being technical) have never as yet found their way into any dictionary.\n\n**Ambil**, or **Tanah Ambil**.\u2014The ore-bearing drift, which Chinese miners call karang.\n\n**Ambil gunong**.\u2014The upper beds of drift.\n\n**Ambil gabor**.\u2014The middle beds of drift.\n\n**Ambil besar**.\u2014The lower beds of drift.\n\n**Ambil biji**.\u2014The process of sluicing after the tin-bearing drift has been thrown into the races. *(See isi parit.)*\n\nThe following is the order of the respective processes included under this term. 1.

The derivation of the name of this primitive Malay censer from the Sanskrit sankha (conch-shell) has been pointed out (Malay Manual, p. 32). Forbes notes having seen in a sacred grove in Java \"the remnants of small torches of sweet gums which had been offered.\" (A Naturalist's Wanderings, p. 97). Ed.\nMr Thomas Henry Haynes has communicated to the society, through Mr Noel Trotter, a vocabulary of the language spoken in the Sulu Islands. This is printed verbatim in the first and second columns of the following pages. In the hope of adding to the interest of this paper, from the philological point of view, I have appended a third column, in which the Malay origin of certain words which have escaped the author's notice is pointed out, and references are given to the equivalents, in other languages of the archipelago, of certain widely-spread words. The latter are given on the authority of Favre's Malay Dictionary (Malais-Fran\u00e7ais). Dr Montano, who visited Sulu between 1879 and 1881 gives a short account of the language *:\n\n\"The Sulu language is only a variety of the Bisaya; the pronunciation and the greater part of the roots are the same; it includes, however, a larger number of strictly Malay words. The Reverend Father Frederico Vila has been kind enough to shew me a manuscript grammar and vocabulary drawn up by the Reverend Father Batll\u00f3 during his residence in Sulu. It is from this source that I borrow the following details:\n\n\"There is no special article in Sulu (as there is in the Tagal group of languages) for proper names. In (equivalent to ang in Bisaya) is employed both with proper names and with substantives; Nom., in: Gen. sina or ni; Dat., Ace., Ablat., in or sa.\n\n\"The plural is denoted by the particle mha; in kuda, the horse; in mha kuda, the horses.\n\n* Rapport \u00e0 M. le Ministre de l'Instruction publique sur une Mission aux \u00eeles Philippines et en Malaisie. Paris, 1885.\n\"The substantive and adjective, which are indeclinable formed as in Bisaya; ka-tapus-an, end, from tapus; ka-usb inheritance, from usba, heir; pa-mumukut, fisherman, from mukut; ma-tigas, from tigas, strong, stout; ma-haggud, haggud, cold, cool; ma-manis, from manis, beautiful.\"\n\n\"The comparative and superlative are formed either by repetition of the positive, or by the word labi, more, or else the particles deni and sin.\"\n\n\"Examples:\u2014marayao, good; marayao-marayao, or marayao deni, better; marayao sin, excellent.\"\n\n\"Ing karut ini asibi, sagua in yatto in labin asibi, in kalabi pa asibi tund. This bag is small, but that one is smaller and yours is the smallest of all.\"\n\n\"The mode of expressing a verbal sense is that of the Bisaya language. The auxiliaries to be and to have, expressed by the particles man, hay, aun, are very often left to be understood. Hay is sometimes contracted into y, which is used as a substitute. Ako-y ma-sakit, I am ill. Ikao miskin na, you are poor. Raun karabao ako, I have a great many buffaloes. The formation of verbs, as mag-sumpan, to serve, mah-sasat, to encourage, and the conjugations appear to be in conformity with those found in Bisaya.\"\n\n\"Pronouns and adjectives only differ from those of the Bisaya language in certain trifling peculiarities.\"\n\n\"The panditas and datos of Sulu can all write with ease. Like the Malays, they use the Arabic character with slight modifications. The Malays hardly ever use the vowel signs, whereas the natives of Sulu never leave them out and even those among the latter who know Malay are unable to read works in which these signs are omitted. At least this is what I was assured of by the late Sultan of Sulu, who was the most distinguished scholar in his Empire.\"\n\n\"The Sulu dialect is spoken by all the Malays, or Moros, of Mindanao, Palawan, Balabac, Basilan, the archipelagoes of Sulu and Tawi-Tawi and of the North of Borneo.\"\n\nW. E.

Ed.]\n\n1. The report for the year 1885 gives the results of the observations taken at Singapore, Penang, Province Wellesley and Malacca, and embraces the following meteorological elements:\n\nI. Atmospheric Pressure.\nII. Temperature of Air.\nIII. Temperature of Solar Radiation.\nIV. Temperature of Grass, Nocturnal Radiation.\nV. Humidity.\nVI. Wind, Direction and Velocity.\nVII. Rainfall.\n\n2. Annual abstracts of the observations, taken at the four recording stations are attached, as are also the annual registers of rainfall.\n\n3. The accompanying charts shew the mean annual pressure, temperature, rainfall, and the number of days on which rain fell at Singapore, from 1870 to 1885. These tables are interesting, and gain in importance every year.\n\n4. I regret that some of the registers shew a few unavoidable interruptions, but care will be taken in future that these returns be made as complete as possible.\n\nAtmospheric Pressure.\n\n| Stations     | Highest Date | Lowest Date | Range for the year | Mean for the year |\n|--------------|--------------|-------------|--------------------|------------------|\n|              | Inches       | Inches      | Inches             | Inches           |\n| Singapore    | 30.088 22nd Jan | 29.708 29th Oct | .106               | 29.889           |\n| Penang       | 30.197 7th Jan | 29.712 17th Dec | .102               | 29.972           |\n| P.

The highest percentage of humidity (100%) was observed at Province Wellesley and Malacca, on the 10th August and 28th May, respectively. At the latter Settlement, also, the lowest percentage was recorded, viz., 36% on the 15th January, and the highest mean percentage, viz., 84%.\n\nWind, Direction and Velocity.\n\n10. From January to March, the wind blew from the N. E. and occasionally from the N. N. E. and N. In the early part of April, the wind was easterly.\n\n11. The S. W. Monsoon appeared in the latter part of April, and, with but slight variations from S. E., continued steady until October. In November, the winds were variable, sometimes W. and at times W. S. W.\n\n12. December ushered in the N. E. Monsoon with occasional winds from the N. N. W. and N. W.\n13.

The velocity of the wind was registered during months of the year only, owing to the anemometer being out of repair; during the other three months no observations were taken. The mean velocity for this period was 113 miles, and the greatest in 24 hours was 263 miles on 5th March.\n\nPenang and Province Wellesley.\n\n15. During the year 1885, no observations of the direction and velocity of the wind were taken. We hope next year to have this omission rectified.\n\nMalacca.\n\n16. The N. E. wind prevailed from January to April, again from November to December. During the months of the year, the wind was generally S. W.\n\n17. The mean velocity of the wind during the t\nmonths was 183 miles, and the greatest velocity in any one day was 470 miles.\n\nRainfall.\n\n18. The total number of registering stations in the Straits during the year 1885 was 29, being 18 over the number in 1884. Eighteen of these, viz., 7 in Singapore, 3 in Penang, 5 in Province Wellesley and 3 in Malacca, supplied complete returns; the remaining 11 furnishing theirs only incompletely. At Singapore, new stations were started during the year at the Botanic Gardens, Neidpath, Chasserian's Estate and Bukit Timah, but, owing to the absence of the official in charge of the last-named station, the observation had to be discontinued in September.\n\n19. At the beginning of the year, the station at the Leper Asylum, Pulau Jerajah, which hitherto furnished returns for Penang, was placed under the supervision of the Colonial Surgeon, Province Wellesley, and the observations there have since been embodied in the returns of that Settlement. A new station will shortly be opened at Balik Pulau, Penang, which is much required.\n\n20. At Province Wellesley, no new stations were opened during the year, the four registering stations at the District Hospitals and the one at the Leper Island being found to be ample.\n\n21. In Malacca, seven new stations were started in the course of the year 1885, in different situations, and a few more will be opened in 1886. Mr. Hervey, the Resident Councillor, takes a keen interest on the subject of the rainfall at this Settlement, and I am obliged to him for suggestions as to the best localities for having them.\n\nSingapore.\n\n22. On the whole, the year 1885 was a very dry one, it being, leaving out 1877, among the driest on record. The mean fall for the year was 67.32 inches only, and the number of days on which rain fell, 134.\n\n23. The maximum fall (16.37 inches) occurred in December at the Sepoy Lines, and on the 20th of the same month, at the same station, was recorded the greatest fall in 24 hours, viz., 6.10 inches. The minimum fall in any one\nmonth was that registered at the Water-Works Thompson Road, viz., 0.63 inches.\n\n24. As already noticed by others, it is interesting to study the Singapore tables of rainfall, and to observe how every few years, varying apparently from 8 to 10 inches, there is a very large annual fall of rain, and a smaller fall still above the average, about every five years. This seems, at least, to be the more or less general rule, if we look at the records from their very commencement.\n\n25. What degree of influence the forest destruction has had (happily now checked), which has been going on for some years, has had on our rainfall, it is difficult to say. Considering the situation of Singapore island relative to the two monsoons, and the very few hills we have, it is not enough to affect much the rain-bearing clouds, but I think it has been very great.\n\n26. That, however, forest desiccation does influence rainfall materially, there can be little doubt. Of the proofs now exist, but in further confirmation may be found an article which appeared early in this year in an American paper called the Southern Bivouac upon the subject of destruction which has been going on recently in this country. The writing is clothed in the tall but quaint and picturesque language of a Transatlantic cousin, whose view, though somewhat mystic, doubtless yet contains much truth. It is entitled \"Forest Desiccation\" and runs thus:\u2014\n\n\"If the progress of tree destruction in the Alleghanies, should continue at the present rate, the inundations of the Ohio valley will soon assume another aspect, and ere long the scenes of the river suburbs of Pittsburgh and Cincinnati will repeat themselves at Nashville and Chattanooga, while the summers will become hotter and drier. In the Gulf States, the work of desiccation is alarming advances, brooks and streams shrink from year to year, and warm summers expose the gravel of rivers which fifty years ago could hardly be touched by the feet of heavy laden vessels. East America is drying up, and in the paradise of the blue grass region, the failing of the forests has driven many stock-raisers with their herds into the mountains.\"\nPenang.\n\n27. During the first five months of the year, the fall was unusually small, but was compensated however by heavy falls during the last seven months consecutively. The mean for the year is 110.81, as compared with 86.02 in 1884, shewing an increase of 24.79 inches.\n\n28. The greatest fall in 24 hours was recorded on 12th July, viz., 6.93 inches at Government Hill. At this station there was also recorded the greatest fall in any one month, viz., 28.89 inches in September. The smallest fall on record is 0.27 inches, which was in January, and at the Central Prison.\n\nProvince Wellesley.\n\n29. The rainfall at this Settlement during 1885 was heavy, 106.29 inches was the mean, against 80.60 in the previous year. The greatest fall in 24 hours was 5.60 inches at Bertam on 14th October. The driest month was January. No rain was registered at Butterworth and Pulau Jerajah, and the mean fall recorded at the other stations for the month was only 1.62 inches. October seems to have been the wettest month, the record shewing 21.03 inches.\n\nMalacca.\n\n30. The mean fall registered at the three stations where the returns were complete was 67.71 inches, being 10 inches less than that for 1884. The driest month was February, when the mean fall was 0.75 inches only. The maximum fall was in October; 14.32 inches of rain fell at Kandang.\n\n31. The greatest fall in 24 hours was 4.29 inches on the 15th October at the same station.\n\n32. The following brief notes on the general state of the weather in the Straits will be found interesting.\n\n33. The month of January was dry, more so in Province Wellesley. In Singapore, although the days were hot and dry, the nights were cool and refreshing. Those in January were the coldest on record. From the 9th to the 14th in particular, the minimum temperature fell from 69.9\u00b0F. to 63.9\u00b0F., with a corresponding fall of the grass radiation thermometer, the lowest recorded on the latter instrument being 59.9\u00b0F. on the 14th January. This low temperature was also observed on reliable independent testimony at Johor,\nfor a long drought. No rain fell in\nthe month, and the total fall registe\nat Kampong Kerbau.

B. Scorteccini has sent the following Note dated Thaipeng, 26th January, 1886, for publication:\n\n\"Kindly give me leave to set at rest the identity of the plant which Mr. Swettenham refers to in his journal across the Malay Peninsula as printed in Journal No. 13 of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, p. 13. In this paper, the plant is called by the native name of Memplas, and in an editorial note an effort is made to identify it with some kind of Michelia. Allow me to say, that most decidedly it cannot be a Michelia. The few known Michelias, and the fewer that are known in the Peninsula, are large trees, with rather smooth foliage and have solitary flowers. Those described by Mr. Swettenham are by no means large trees, the foliage feels exactly like sand-paper, and to this purpose in many places it is used. I am in a position to state that the plant to which Mr. Swettenham alludes is Delima sarmentosa, L., a very common sarmentose plant, which generally makes its appearance among secondary growth in the low lands.\"\n\n\"I would not have troubled you to set right this point of nomenclature, were it not for the many mistakes which are apt to creep in between Malayan names of plants, and their corresponding scientific names. Lately I had occasion to note an error of this kind in reference to the plant which, among Malays, goes by the name of Ikan tuba. It is well known how Malays and other people make use of a certain part of some plant to stupefy and catch fish by poisoning the water with it. This substance in Tamil is called Walsura, in Malay Ikan tuba. It is not yielded by the same plant. The fruit and\ncoccus, W. A., commonly called by\nperman coccus, L., to which Malas\ntuba, as Ikan tuba would go to signify\nThis name being appropriated to M.\nwhich speak of Malayan usages, is\ntaken to signify no other plant has\nFrom the fact, therefore, that a plant\nlegitimately conclude that it is Meuia\nso it was not Memisperma coccus c\ncoccus, the plant which had appear\nname of Ikan tuba and the scientific\ncoccus. Any slight acquaintance with\nmarcu would have persuaded a simple\nthat the specimens, although devoid\nrepresenting only the foliage, could n\npermiad. Pinnated leaves as the s\nindeed, even as an exception, occur i\nform. I would be rather inclined to\ntion to some Derris among the Leg\nteresting to know that besides the M\nanother Ikan tuba just as effectual as\nwould give me great pleasure, were a\ncommunicate some flowering or fruitin\nstill, both, in order to refer the plant\nand specific position.\"\n\n[It sometimes happens that the\nlished in this Journal use Malay w\nor explanation. Such a practice, if g\ninconvenient by many readers of th\nunderstand Malay. It falls to the\nSecretary) to insert translations and,\nvalent of a word (e.g., a tree or pla\nname has sometimes been given on\ndictionaries.\nNo one is likely to disagree with the general proposition that the same native name may be applied to a variety of trees or plants possessed of similar properties, and that, in consequence of this rough classification it is unsafe to decide, from the mere fact of the use of the generic native appellation, which individual, out of several varieties, is intended to be meant. But if Malay scholars in the Straits have much to learn of botany, botanists, on the other hand, have to guard against errors resulting from want of knowledge of the native language. In Mr. Scortecchini's letter a plant is repeatedly described, incorrectly, as ikan tuba. He has evidently been misled by some similarity in sound between ikan, fish, and akar, root. Tuba is the plant, akar tuba, the tuba root, (the portion used by the Malays for stupefying fish), while tuba ikan, or menuba ikan, means to kill fish with tuba. Ikan tuba, if there were such an expression, could only be the designation of a kind of fish \"the tuba fish.\"\u2014Ed.]\n\nTHE DUTCH MID-SUMATRA EXPEDITION.\n\nMr. Van Hasselt writes from Batavia as follows under date February 15th, 1886:\n\n\"In reply to the editor's note, which precedes the translation of the account I gave at the third International Geographical Congress at Venice, September, 1881, of the object and the results of a Dutch expedition into the interior of Sumatra in the years 1877, 1878 and 1879, I have the honour hereby to inform you that not only do not in the least object to the said translation being published, but, on the contrary, appreciate its being spread; for it is my earnest desire that both object and results of that Dutch expedition, which I am confident did much towards increasing our knowledge of the interior of Sumatra, may become more generally known also to your countrymen.\"\n\n\"In the account given by me at Venice, I had to record\nthe death of our fellow-explorer, the Naval Officer Mr. S. Santvoort; in these lines I find occasion to record the of another of our fellow-travellers, that of my highly esteemed and beloved friend Mr. D. D. Veth, Civil Engineer, who died the 19th of May, 1885, near the Kalahanla River, near Luanda, S. W. Coast of Africa.\"\n\n\"Some time after his return home from Sumatra, he resolved on exploring another part of the world, and he chose the Cunene River as the object for his researches.\"\n\n\"Being a man of great character, who to much less joined a firm will and the power both mental and physical execute what he undertook, Mr. Veth, once resolved, his expedition entirely got up and fully equipped in less than a year's time.\"\n\n\"The 7th of December, 1884, he arrived at Mossambique where his travelling companions, Messrs. P. J. van der Kolk and L. J. Goddebroi, had arrived some short time previously himself.\"\n\n\"It has not been permitted to this valiant explorer achieve what he had begun. The climate was fatal to his bodily strength soon gave way, and he died, as a result of his character and of his uncommon zeal might die, amidst of his labours, engaged in the fulfilment of the task he had undertaken.\"\n\n\"I lost in Mr. Veth a noble and dear friend, Holland's greatest explorer of rare learning and valour, who, had he been spared, might yet have rendered great services to his country.\"\n\nNATIONALITIES OF THE INDO-CHINESE REGION\n\nThe following sketch of the distribution of the Chinese races and of the nature and extent of Indian infl...\nin the further East, occurs in an article on \"Burma, Past and Present,\" in the Quarterly Review for January, 1886.\u2014Ed.\n\n\"Assuming a descent in remote ages of the nations occupying the Indo-Chinese region from beyond the great plateau, perhaps most of them through China, we must assign to the Malays (if they are to be included) the earliest date. They seem to have left upon the continent as their nearest kin the Tsians, or people of Champa, in the extreme south-east, if these were not rather a reflux of colonization from the islands. To an early wave of migration southward perhaps belong also the M\u00f4ns (Talaings, as the Burmese have taught us to style them), that is, the people of Pegu, whom some have supposed, owing to linguistic indications, to have found their way south through India itself; then the Khmer, or Cambodians, occupying the lower valley and delta of the Mekong; and the Anam, or people of Cochin China. Then come the Mramma, or Burman race, apparently descending the Irawaddy, pressing before them the M\u00f4ns into the delta, the Khyens and like tribes into the adjoining mountains. One great branch of the Burman race, by themselves reckoned the elder, passed over the mountains to the shores of the Bay of Bengal, shores which, according to their traditions, they found occupied by Bilis or Rakkus; that is, by cannibal monsters, from whom in after days the country got its name of Rakan or Aracan. Later still, perhaps, succeeded the great family of the Lao, Thai, or Shans, who have still congeners in Southern China, and who occupied the plateau of Yunnan, the middle basin of the Mekong, and the upper part of the Menam. In latter days this race has flowed back upon the Upper Irawaddy, even to the Brahmaputra, and has spread south to the coasts of the Malay Peninsula and of Siam; the kingdom bearing the latter name having been established by a branch of the race.\n\nAs usual, the course of occupation has mainly followed the line of the great rivers, those highways of the early world; and their valleys and deltas have become the seat of the more civilized monarchies. Thus the Burmese still occupy the Irawaddy basin, and the coast-plains of Aracan. Sixty years ago, the whole race were united under one native monarchy. The latest of an intermittent series of events, since then, has\nunited them once more under a single sovereign, but this in the person of Queen Victoria. The Anamites who occupy the eastern shores are claimed also, though with more doubtful realization, to be under the one dominion, whether sovereignty or protectorate, of the French Republic. Between these two are the great Siam race, whose settlements, spreading with intervals from the banks of the Brahmaputra to the coast of the Malay Peninsula, and down the Mekong, nearly to the delta, are divided under an infinity of petty princes, claimed as tributaries by a variety of sovereign governments, everywhere displaying a fair amount of civilization, though decay, everywhere possessed of letters, everywhere, except Assam (which they first entered in the thirteenth century) followers of Buddha, and everywhere speaking substantially the same language. Siam is now the only independent State of the race. The Talaings, the Khmer, the Tsiam, have been famous in their day; but they are now shrunken and decaying, and are being gradually absorbed by races of greater vitality.\n\nThe chief nationalities that we have named have played the history of Indo-China the part which England, France, Germany, and Spain, have played on the Continent of Europe. Most of them have stood forth under considerable monarchies for more than a thousand years, some of them much more. All their countries have in turn (some, such as Burma, again and again) been the seat of conquering empires, extending their grasp, in some instances, almost from sea to sea; and in turn have been the subjects of vast disaster. But beside these more prominent races, there are many of inferior importance, whom we generally characterize as 'wild tribes.' Some of them are inferior to the 'civilized races,' on which they border, only in the absence of a written language; while others are head-hunters in a low depth of savagery. Some as elaborate in the culture of their rice-terraces as the Chinese; others migrate in the forest from site to site, burning down each remove new areas of jungle, on which to carry out their rude hand-husbandry.\n\nAmong these 'uncivilized' tribes, none are more worthy of note and interest than those known conjointly as Karens.\noccupying sparse settlements in Pegu (though also far beyond its limits eastward), of whom so many have in our own time become Christians under American teaching. They were notable, even before this closer claim on our interest arose, for their remarkable traditions, both religious and historical. The latter related how, on their migration from the north, they found the Shans in possession of the territory to which they themselves were bound\u2014perhaps the Upper Menam basin. And the Karens cursed them, saying, 'Dwell ye in the dividing of countries;' the applicability of which is interpreted by what has already been said of the Shans.\n\nWe spoke above of the early traces of Hindoo influence. How and when this began we have no real knowledge. But that it was flowing out in pulses eastward from an early date, and apparently long before our era, there can be no question.\n\nBuddhism undoubtedly, with its zealous propaganda, was a most powerful agent in the spread of Indian influence among the Indo-Chinese nations; but possibly that influence had been felt at a much earlier date. If we go back to the oldest record we possess of geographical detail in this region\u2014the course, as tabulated in Ptolemy, of a coasting-voyage from Argyre to the Sin\u00e6, that is, from Aracan to the beginning of China\u2014we shall find the continent and islands studded with names of which nearly a score are of manifest or probable Indian origin. Still, it is possible, that these names were given subsequently to the first movement of Buddhism in this direction; for it is recorded, that after the third Buddhist synod, held at the city of Pataliputra (or Palibothra), now Patna, as early as B.C. 241, Sena and Uttara were despatched on a mission to propagate the doctrine in the Suvarna Bhumi, or Golden Land, that is, Thahtun, near Martaban. Probably a later and larger wave of influence, and even of migration, took place in the first centuries of the Christian era; for it is remarkable that most of the nations of the further East, that have been tinged by Indian civilization, recognize the Indian era of Salivahana, which begins with the year 78 of our reckoning.\n\nLater still, about the fifth century, we recognize in the coincident traditions of the nations a new efflux of action in\nthe same direction; but this time it comes, not from continental India, but from Ceylon, an island which, though roughly Indianized in religion and manners, has yet remarkable affinities with the further East. This last has never entirely worn out; and as the Western general has looked to Rome, and the Russian world to Constantinople, rather than to Jerusalem, as the immediate of ecclesiastical sanctity, so these Indo-Chinese nations still, in a degree, to Ceylon as the metropolis of their faith.\n\nWe have spoken of the Indian influence that can be largely, not only in religion, but in manners, architecture, nomenclature; and indeed the foreign religion necessarily affects all of these. Throughout the hundred principal kingdoms of Indo-China we find, in the etiquette of royalty, in the forms of royal palaces and of court ceremonies, an extraordinary identity, pointing to ancient Hindoo times; the titles of the princes and dignitaries almost universally embrace sonorous terms of Sanskrit, or rather of Pali (not to Sanskrit much the same relation that Italian does to Latin), that dialect in which the sacred books are read in Ceylon, Burma, Siam, and Camboja.*\n\nAs regards nomenclature, we hear from the Chinese traveller Hiouen Thsang (c. 640), of the existence in this part of great kingdoms bearing Hindoo designations, such as Dvaravati, Ramanadvipa, and Mah\u0101-Champa. The name hardly quite extinct yet in the South of Cochin was borrowed from a famous Indian State upon the Ganges. Camboja was named from a region beyond the Indus; a region in the same quarter, Gandh\u0101ra, the Gandarites of Pliny, namely, the country round Peshawar, lent its name to Yunnan, now a province of China, but still bearing in Burmese papers the classic Indian title; Ayodhya, the ancient R\u0101ma, from which is corrupted our modern Oudh, g\n\n* In Java, where there are all the like traces of Indian influence, more ample measure, we find the very title of Arya, i.e., 'Noble or Royal,' which has been adopted as the distinctive note of our Indo-Germanic assumed by every one claiming nobility, among a people in bi-character so diverse from our own.\nname to great cities both in Siam (Yuthia or Yudhya), and in Java (Djokjo of the Dutch); Irawaddy, the great river of Burma, is but another Airavati, that river-name of the Punjab which the historians of Alexander grecized as Hydraotes; Amarapura (\"City of the Immortals\"), which was the capital of Burma twenty-five years ago, is equally Indian; and Mandalay itself, of now familiar sound, properly the name of a conical isolated hill overlooking the city, probably represents Mandara, the sacred hill of Hindoo fable, which served the gods as a churning-staff at the churning of the sea.\n\nBut it is in the great architectural remains scattered over this region that we find the most striking testimony to Indian influence. The native races are, none of them, addicted to architecture in solid materials. Yet, in nearly all these countries we find remains of an elaborate and grandiose architecture devoted to religious purposes. Such in Java are the ancient temples of hewn stone, including the extraordinary pyramid of sculptured terraces called Boro Bodor. In Burma we find edifices of fine brickwork, especially in the remains of the great medieval city of Pag\u00e1n on the Irawaddy, whose ruins cover many square miles, and still exhibit majestic structures, rising, some of them, to a height of nearly 200 feet. Others, also of brick, exist in the dense jungles which cover the remains of Yudhia on the Menam. And within the last quarter-century we have become acquainted with the countless and vast remains of Cambodian architecture; immense temples, with corridors and enclosures of hewn stone, and furlongs of sculptured bas-relief. Latest of all, we are exploring medieval remains in Pegu; which have been at our doors, as it were, since 1853. Each series of remains has its own peculiarities, but often there are close resemblances of general design, and in the ornamental detail there is throughout much approximation to identity of character; and that is Indian.\"\nORIENTAL MUSIC.\n\nThe following Note has been received by the Society regarding a proposed collection of the Musical Instruments and Literature of all Oriental and Extra-European nations, to be deposited in the University of Oxford, for the benefit of Musical students, and for the advancement of Science.\n\nIt is proposed to establish at the University of Oxford a complete and exhaustive collection of all the musical instruments used throughout the world by the Oriental and Extra-European nations, and to accompany this collection by a mass of information, that the facts regarding the music of these nations may be collected, and laid before the musical student in a concise and intelligible form. A thorough investigation into the Sacred and Secular Music of Oriental nations, forms a subject so vast, that it would be impossible for one man to attempt to undertake it. It is hoped however, that with the assistance of the various European musicians resident in Eastern countries, a collection of information may be made and stored, from which a comprehensive text book may be afterwards compiled. For that purpose circulars are herewith issued, and a careful reply to each question earnestly solicited.\n\nThese questions, were, with a few exceptions drawn up by the late Mr. Carl Engel, for \"The British Association for the Advancement of Science,\" and a study of his work on National Music, would greatly assist the investigator. Excellent specimens of the manner in which Oriental music should be written in European notation will be found on pages 283 and 344, of his \"Study of National Music.\"\n\nIt is needless for me to point out the many items of interest which occur in such an investigation, nor how useful results will be to the ethnologist, as well as to the musician; the following will show how much that investigation is required.\n\nThe music of the Burmese (highly spoken of by those who have heard it), is a sealed book to European musicians; the music of the Hindus, though somewhat better known through the efforts of H. H. the Rajah Sir Sourindro Mohun Tagore, yet affords a great field for research.\nFull scores of the Orchestral music of Oriental nations are absolutely wanting.\n\nAt Cochin on the Malabar coast, the most interesting results might be deduced from a comparison of the Sacred music of the White and Black Jews resident there.\n\nThe Sacred music of the Thibetan Buddhists, with their double choirs and antiphonal method of singing, forms another subject of great importance.\n\nIt is a well-known fact, that the more civilised Asiatic nations possess treatises on music. Oriental scholars mention several of the Hindus. Amiot gives a list of about seventy by Chinese authors; and it may be supposed that the Japanese are in this subject not behind the Chinese.\n\nFurther, an acquaintance with the musical instruments of different nations, is of great importance in the study of National music, since the peculiar construction of the instruments enables us in many instances to ascertain with accuracy the characteristic order of intervals, modulations, embellishments and other such distinctive features prevailing in the music of a nation.\n\nAn appeal therefore is made to all musicians, both European and Orientals, to assist in collecting the facts required; and to all those who are not musicians, that they, by their rank, or official position, may afford to the musical collectors, opportunities for access to music they would not ordinarily hear, and to musicians with whom they would not ordinarily meet; and also that by collecting and presenting to the University, treatises on, and manuscripts of, the music: an exhaustive and complete collection of the musical instruments, of the country in which they reside, that may further the advancement of that branch of learning.\n\nIn conclusion, I would add a few cautions to the would-be collector, in addition to those noted on the circulars.\n\nAll the music should be written down as gathered from the mouths of the singers, or from the instruments performed on, without any additions, and in any doubtful or peculiar pas-\nsage an explanation should accompany the score. The where each tune is obtained, should be mentioned, wit nationality or tribe of the musician, and the name of the ment. Deviations in the tunes, or what may be called ent readings, preferred in certain places, should be indi with small notes.\n\nParticular care should be taken in noting where times occur in a piece of music; if there is any doubt the time in which the music is written, mark with about the accented notes, making the dash heavier or according to the force of the accent.\n\nIn the music of Extra-European nations, and strange times occur, for which a look-out should be kept at the same time care should be taken that the observer misled into noting them, by pauses, tempo rubato, gro notes in triplets, &c., or by rests occurring in ordinary ba\n\nFlorid passages of recitative are best left unbarred gradations of time and accent being carefully noted.\n\nIn dances accompanied by vocal and instrumental it is sometimes found that the vocal music is in one time, the dance is in another.\n\nParticular attention should be paid to the music of ginal or savage tribes, resident in the country.\n\nThe notes of birds should be noticed, and enquiry sh be made as to whether their songs are used in mus whether any national airs are derived from their notes.\n\nAll contributors are requested to give their names and their addresses, legibly written, for future reference.\n\nAll communications should be addressed to\n\nM. V. PORTMAN, Esq., Mus. Doc.,\nPort Blair,\nThe Andaman Islan Bay of Be\nVOCAL MUSIC.\n\n1. Are the people fond of music?\n2. Is their ear acute for discerning small musical intervals?\n3. Can they easily hit a tone which is sung or played to them?\n4. Is their voice flexible?\n5. What is the quality of the voice? Is it loud or soft, clear or rough, steady or tremulous?\n6. What is the usual compass of the voice?\n7. Which is the prevailing male voice\u2014tenor, baritone, or bass?\n8. Which is the prevailing female voice\u2014soprano or alto?\n9. Do the people generally sing without instrumental accompaniment?\n10. Have they songs performed in chorus by men only, or by women only, or by both sexes together?\n11. Have they any professional singers? If so, describe their training and mode of life?\n12. When the people sing together, do they sing in unison or in harmony, or with the occasional introduction of some drone accompaniment of the voice?\n13. Is their singing in regular time, or does it partake of the character of the recitative?\n\nNOTE.\u2014In answering these questions, the greatest care should be taken, by frequent investigation from various people, and on the same point; to give the opinion, not of one, but of several competent musicians.\n\nIn taking down their songs in musical notation, no attempt should be made to correct any supposed fault on the part of the singer, nor should the music be altered or made conformable to European ideas.\n\nNo song should be taken down unless it has been sung on three separate occasions, by three different people, and no extraneous harmony or accompaniment, should be added to it.\n\nShould the people use intervals smaller than semitones, such as \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) or \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) tones, particular care should be taken to note them down, by writing in notation the semitones most below the tone sung, and writing the fraction above it.\n\nThe more faithfully the peculiarities of the music are preserved, the more valuable is the notation. Collections of popular tunes (with the words of the airs) are very desirable.\n\nAll collectors are requested to write their name and address legibly at the foot of their manuscripts and in answering the questions, to quote the heading, and the number of the question.\n14. Have they songs for solo and chorus, or with the accompaniment for a single voice, and a burden (or refrain) for a number of voices?\n\n15. Describe the different kinds of songs which they have (such as sacred songs, war songs, love songs, nursery songs, &c.) with remarks of the poetry.\n\n16. Write down in the language of the country, and give at the same time, a literal English translation of, as many of the songs of all classes as you can collect.\n\n17. Write out, in a similar manner, the libretto of any operas, or plays accompanied by music, which they may have; and take particular care to mark the accent, rhythm and metre.\n\n18. Write down in notation, the exact score of their songs with the instrumental accompaniment, if any.\n\n19. Have they any books or manuscripts, on the art of singing, giving instructions in singing, or any collections of songs, with or without music?\n\n20. If there is anything noteworthy about their vocal music, which has not been noticed in the preceding questions, notice it.\n\nMusical Instruments.\n\n1. What are their instruments of percussion (such as drums, castanets, rattles, cymbals, gongs, bells, &c.)\n\n2. Have they instruments of percussion containing sonorous slabs of wood, glass, stone, metal, &c., upon which tunes can be played? If so, write down the notation, or in letters, the tones emitted by the slabs.\n\nNote.\u2014Complete collections of the musical instruments of the various Eastern countries, are of the greatest value, and these collections should include the instruments, in their different artistic forms, as used by all classes. Photographs of musicians playing, both singly and in orchestras, and dancers in every attitude, are also of value.\n\nCare should be taken to describe exactly the materials of which the different parts of the instruments are made, whether any particular value attaches to certain woods, etc., and the botanical name of the wood, as well as its native name, should be given. Also whether any particular value is attached to certain forms of instrument, and whether there are any makers, of peculiar excellence in their craft.\n3. Have they drums, with cords or some other contrivance, by means of which the parchment can be tightened, or slackened at pleasure?\n\n4. Have they drums with definite tones (like our kettle-drums)?; and if so, what are the tones in which they are tuned, when two or more are played together?\n\n5. Have they any open hand-drums, with one parchment only, like our tambourine?\n\n6. Are the drums beaten with sticks, or with the hands, and is there anything peculiar or noteworthy in the manner in which they are beaten.\n\n7. What wind-instruments (trumpets, flutes, &c.) have they?\n\n8. Have they any trumpets with sliding tubes (like the trombone)?\n\n9. How are the flutes sounded? Is there a plug in the mouth-hole?\n\n10. Have they any nose-flutes?\n\n11. What is the number, and the position of the finger-holes on the flutes?\n\n12. What tones do the flutes yield if the finger-holes are closed in regular succession, upwards, or downwards?\n\n13. If the people have the syrinx (or Pandean pipe), ascertain the series of musical intervals yielded by the tubes.\n\n14. Do the people construct wind-instruments, with a vibrating reed, or some similar contrivance, inserted in the mouth-hole?\n\n15. If they have a reed wind-instrument, observe whether the reed is single (like that of the clarionet), or double (like that of the oboe).\n\n16. Have they a kind of bag-pipe?\n\n17. What musical instruments have they, which are not used by them in musical performances, but merely for conveying signals, and for such like purposes?\n18. Have they stringed instruments, the strings of which are sounded by being twanged with the fingers?\n19. Have they any stringed instruments, twanged with a plectrum?\n20. Have they any stringed instruments beaten with sticks or hammers (like the dulcimer)?\n21. Have they any stringed instruments played with a bow?\n22. If there are stringed instruments, with frets on the neck (as is the case with our guitar), note down the intervals produced by the frets in regular succession.\n23. What are the substances of which the strings are made?\n24. Is there any particular contrivance on some of the instruments in the arrangement, and situation of the strings?\n25. Are there stringed instruments with sympathetic strings (i.e., strings placed under those strings which are played upon; the sympathetic strings merely serve to increase the sonorousness)?\n26. What are the musical intervals in which the stringed instruments are tuned?\n27. Do the people possess any musical instrument of a peculiar construction? If so describe it minutely.\n28. Give the name of each instrument in the language of the country.\n29. Describe each instrument, and give illustrations, if possible, showing the exact way, in which the instruments are held and played.\n30. Give some account of the makers of musical instruments; of the woods, metals, hide, gut, hair, and other materials they use; of their tools, etc.\n31. What are the usual adornments and appendages of musical instruments?\n32. If there is anything noteworthy, about their musical instruments, which has not been alluded to in the preceding questions, notice it.\n\n33. Had the nation at any previous period musical instruments, different from those now in use?\n\n34. Have they any books containing descriptions of musical instruments, or directions for their construction?\n\nCOMPOSITIONS.\n\n1. On what order of intervals is the music of the people founded? Is it the diatonic major scale (like c, d, e, f, g, a, b, c), or the diatonic minor scale (in which the third is flat, thus c, d, e flat, f, g, a, b, c), or the pentatonic scale (in which the fourth and seventh are omitted, thus (c, d, e, g, a, c), or some other order of intervals?\n\n2. Is the seventh used sharp (c\u2014b), or flat (c\u2014b flat)?\n\n3. Does the superfluous second occur in the scale? (In the example c, d, e flat, f sharp, g, a flat, b, c, the steps from the third to the fourth, and from the sixth to the seventh are superfluous seconds.)\n\nNOTE.\u2014The greatest care should be taken in answering the above questions. The music of every nation has certain characteristics of its own. The progressions of intervals, the modulations, embellishments, rhythmical effects, &c., occurring in the music of extra-European nations are not unfrequently too peculiar to be accurately indicated by means of our musical notation. Some additional explanation is therefore required with the notation. In writing down the popular tunes of foreign countries on hearing them sung or played by the natives, no attempt should be made to rectify anything which may appear incorrect to the European ear. The more faithfully the apparent defects are preserved, the more valuable is the notation. Attention is called to \"The Study of National Music\" by Mr. CAMERONEL, in which admirable examples of Eastern music transcribed carefully to European notation will be found; notably those on pages 28 & 29 \"Cannibal Song of the Marquesas Islanders,\" and on pages 30, 31 and 32 \"Airs of the Zelanders.\" A perusal of this work would greatly assist the investigator.\n4. Does the music contain progressions in semitones or chromatic intervals?\n\n5. Are there smaller intervals than semitones, such as \u00bd tones, \u00bc tones?\n\n6. Are there peculiar progressions in certain intervals which are of frequent occurrence in the tunes? If so, what are they?\n\n7. Do the tunes usually conclude in the tonic (the keynote, or the first interval of the scale)? Or if not, what other interval?\n\n8. Do the tunes contain modulations from one key to another? If so, describe the usual modulations.\n\n9. Are there certain rhythmical peculiarities predominant in the music? If so, what are they?\n\n10. Is the time of the music, generally, common time, triple time, or irregular?\n\n11. Are there phrases, or passages, in the melodies, which are of frequent re-occurrence?\n\n12. Have the airs of the songs re-occurrences of musical phrases which are traceable to the form of poetry?\n\n13. Have the people musical compositions which they regard as very old? And do these compositions exhibit the same characteristics which are found in modern ones?\n\n14. Are the compositions generally lively or grave?\n\n15. Describe the Form of the various kinds of musical compositions. (Form being taken in its musical sense, as Sonata-form, etc.)\n\n16. If there is anything noteworthy about their composition or manner of composing which has not been alluded to in the preceding questions, notice it.\nPERFORMANCES.\n\n1. Have the people musical bands, or orchestras?\n2. Which are the instruments generally used in combination?\n3. Which are the instruments commonly used singly?\n4. What is the number of performers in a properly constituted band?\n5. What proportion do the instruments bear to each other in a properly constituted band or orchestra; do they vary according to the purposes for which the band is used?\n6. Is there a leader of the band? How does he direct the performers?\n7. Does the band play in unison or in harmony?\n8. If vocal music is combined with instrumental music, performed by the band: is the instrumental accompaniment in unison (or in octaves) with the voices, or has it something of its own?\n9. Is the tempo generally fast or slow?\n10. Are there sudden changes, or gradual changes in the tempo?\n11. Are there changes in the degree of loudness?\n12. Do the musicians, on repeating a piece, introduce alterations or variations of the theme?\n13. Do they introduce embellishments ad libitum?\n14. Mention the occasions (religious ceremonies, social and public amusements, celebrations, processions, etc.) on which musical performances take place.\n\nNOTE.\u2014The full scores of Oriental orchestral music are much to be desired, as is also all information regarding their methods of orchestration.\n15. Are there military bands? And how are they constituted?\n\n16. Is music employed to facilitate manual labour?\n\n17. Are there songs, or instrumental compositions pertaining to particular occupations, or trades?\n\n18. Have the people a national hymn, or an instrumental composition, which they perform in honour of their sovereign, or in commemoration of some public event?\n\n19. Describe minutely the musical performances at religious worship, if there are any.\n\n20. Have they sacred dances performed in religious ceremonies, at funerals, etc.?\n\n21. Have they any war dances, dances of defiance, etc.?\n\n22. Have they any dances, in which they imitate peculiar movements and habits of certain animals?\n\n23. Are their dances accompanied by musical instruments, by singing, or merely by rhythmical sounds, such as clapping of hands, snapping of fingers, reiterated vociferation, &c.?\n\n24. Give a list of all the dances.\n\n25. Endeavour to ascertain whether the rhythm of the music accompanying the dance is suggested by the steps of the dancers, or vice versa.\n\n26. Give if possible illustrations or photographs of musicians performing on their instruments.\n\n27. Give full scores of their operas, theatrical representations, religious music, etc.\n\n28. Give if possible, illustrations, or photographs of dancers, in every attitude, and combination.\n\n29. If there is anything noteworthy about their performances, which has not been alluded to in the preceding questions, notice it.\nCULTIVATION.\n\n1. Do the people easily learn a melody by ear?\n2. Have they a good musical memory?\n3. Are the children taught music? And if so, how is it done?\n4. Are there professional musicians?\n5. Are there any performers who evince much talent?\n6. Are there any minstrels, bards, or reciters of old ballads?\n7. Are there any professional improvisators?\n8. Are there professional musicians of different grades?\n9. Who composes the music?\n10. Do the musicians follow other professions besides music?\n11. Are the ministers of religion also musicians, and medical men?\n12. Have the people some kind of musical notation?\n13. Have they written signs for raising and lowering the voice in singing, for giving emphasis to certain words or phrases, or for similar purposes? If so, describe the signs.\n14. Do they possess treatises on the history, theory, etc. of music: instruction books for singing, and for playing musical instruments, &c.? If so, give a detailed account of their musical literature.\n15. Have they musical institutions? Give an account of them.\n16. How do the people appreciate their own music?\n17. What impression does the music of foreign countries produce upon them?\n18. Have any particular class (such as sailors) peculiar songs of their own? If so, describe them.\n19. If there is anything noteworthy about their music, which has not been alluded to in the preceding questions, notice it.\n\nNOTE.\u2014A complete collection of the treatises on the music of Eastern countries, written by Oriental musicians, is much to be desired.\nTRADITIONS.\n\n1. Are there popular traditions respecting the origin of music?\n2. Have they any myths about a musical deity, or some super-human musician?\n3. Have they any legends or fairy-tales in which allusion is made to music? If so, what are they?\n4. Have they any tradition about the invention of certain favourite musical instruments?\n5. Have they any tradition or historical record respecting the antiquity of stringed instruments played with a bow?\n6. Have they any records respecting their sacred music?\n7. Is music believed to possess the power of curing certain illnesses?\n8. Is music believed to possess the power of enticing or taming wild animals?\n9. Are there popular tunes, or certain rhythmical figures in the tunes, which according to tradition have been suggested by the songs of birds?\n10. If there is anything noteworthy about music which has not been alluded to in the preceding questions, notice it.\n\nNOTE.\u2014A collection of the national Folk-Lore, would be valuable, in far as it relates to music.\nSINGAPORE WEATHER IN 1885.\n\nDry and wet seasons are, in their effects, even more distinguished by the frequency and infrequency of rain than by the relative quantity of the rainfall. On this account it is my practice, at the close of each year, to make notes of the droughts which have characterised it. The rain-gauge registers hundredths of an inch, and I note as \"droughts\" all periods of seven consecutive days and upwards without measurable rain, and all periods of longer duration with only trifling rainfall. I was absent during the exceptionally dry year 1877, but, judging from the printed returns for that year, it did not surpass 1885 in this respect. The following are my notes for the latter year.\n\nFrom 7th to 15th January,\u20149 days,\u2014only 0.01 inch.\nFrom 11th to 30th March,\u201420 days,\u2014only one fall of 0.06 inch.\nFrom 14th to 29th August,\u201416 days,\u2014only 0.09 inch in three falls.\nFrom 5th to 15th September,\u201411 days,\u2014only one fall of 0.10 inch.\n\nNo measurable Rain.\n\nFrom 5th to 12th February, ... 8 days.\n,, 16th to 30th March, ... 15 \"\n,, 15th to 24th April, ... 10 \"\n,, 26th April to 2nd May, ... 7 \"\n,, 3rd to 13th May,\u201411 days,\u2014the fall was only 0.36 inch.\n,, 26th April to 2nd May, ... 7 \"\n,, 16th to 23rd June, ... 8 \"\n,, 23rd July to 3rd August, ... 12 \"\n,, 1st to 9th October, ... 9 \"\n,, 23rd to 30th December, ... 8 \"\nIn fact, November was the only month of the year from drought. It may be added that in January, March, August the monthly fall was less than 2 inches, and in other months less than 3 inches. On the other hand, I registered in 1885 on 162 days, while in 1877 the number of days at Kandang Kerbau Observatory was only 125.\n\nIt is remarkable that, while the South-west monsoon in 1885 was exceptionally hot, the nights in January and February were, I think, unprecedentedly cold, December having also been remarkably cold, though the rain, as on the 12th of the month, was very scanty.\n\nA. KNIGHT\n\nFEUDAL TENURE IN THE DUTCH EAST INDIES IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.\n\nThe practice followed in Malacca, during the first years of the Settlement, was a Dutch possession, of obtaining the sanction of the Court of Justice to every transfer or mortgage, * was no doubt consequent upon the existence of a charge analogous to that made in Batavia, as to land in the vicinity of that town, under a Proclamation of April 1627. It will be seen from the annexed note, translated from the \"Plakaatboek\" of Mr. Van der Chijs, that the tenure in Batavia was feudal, the Company being the lord, and the holders of fiefs originally had to pay one-quarter of the value of their holdings every time that the property changed hands. This was reduced in 1627 to one-tenth.\n\nProclamation about Landed-Property and Estates.\n\n1st April, 1627. All lands and estates both within and beyond the jurisdiction of Batavia, already held as fiefs or to be granted as such, are declared to be \"exempt from the name and servitude of fiefs and discharged from feudal vices and to be personal, inheritable and allodial property lands.\"\n\n* See Malay Land Tenure\u2014Journal, Straits Branch R. A. S., No. 13.\nBlocks of land and estates had frequently been granted to \"residents and Company's servants\" under the title and in the form of \"fiefs\" and on the following terms, namely, that with every \"licensed alienation\" one-quarter of the value of the land had to be paid to the Company.\n\nThis clause and another one which provided for \"certain special duties and liabilities\" were evidently found to be too severe and to retard the development of agriculture round Batavia, and for this reason the Government introduced the provision that as to those occupied lands and estates \"both within and beyond the jurisdiction of this city,\" and also as to those lands, estates and gardens which might thereafter be granted, no greater sum should in future be paid than one-tenth of their value, upon each sale or alienation, for \"seignorial rights\" (just like the house-property within the town itself), exclusive of the annual tithe of the fruit and crops of such estates and gardens, and that no other duties should be leviable.\n\nThe above decree was promulgated in pursuance of a Resolution of the Supreme Government of 1st February, 1627.\n\nREGULATIONS ABOUT ESTATES AND LANDED PROPERTIES,\n\nWITHIN AND BEYOND THE JURISDICTION OF BATAVIA.\n\n11th April, 1628. The intention of Government in its Proclamation of 1st April, 1627, was to bring about the amelioration and improvement \"of landed properties and estates,\" but instead of co-operating to obtain that end, many land-owners, \"in order to nourish and satisfy their insatiable covetousness, had been so bold as to aggravate and to make worse the condition of their lands, by excavating and exhausting them for brick-kilns and otherwise, so much so that, after a few years, the said estates would become waste, unproductive and useless.\" Thence it was prohibited to do anything tending to the \"detriment or prejudice\" of the said properties and estates, under penalty of,\u2014\nbody wanted to dig earth on his property or for anything else,\" he had to \"an order and a regulation of 1629 to prevent him from \"spoiling\" the property.\n\nLand-owners were obliged \"to keep them clean and in good order,\" grown with bushes and jungle and \"not only of robbers and rascals, but also of carnivorous and hurtful animals,\" as above stated.\"\n\nRE-INTRODUCTION OF THE SIRIUS\n\n12th February, 1629. This regulation was made by the Magistrate:\u2014As \"the lately finished farm from being let out,\" some regulations were made at present,\" to grant it for two months (from 14th February, 1629) to Captain Barreiro, who alone was allowed to gather all the pinang \"growing on all the improvised farms and also on those which did not belong to him.\"\n\nTransgressors of this order were to be punished.\n\nEverybody could grow so much sirius on his land as he liked to do, but he had to pay \"at first cost of 3/4 of a real to the San Pedro,\" again at one real and a quarter, for the privilege.\n\nThe farmer had to station watchmen \"to take care of the fulfilment of the order,\" and \"serve everybody.\"\nASIATIC STUDIES, BY DUTCH SOCIETIES IN 1885.\n\nThe Royal Institute of The Hague has, in the past year, done much good work in the large area over which its operations extend. The following articles of its Journal (Bijdragen tot de taal-land-en volkenkunde van Nederlandsch-Indie) are of interest to our Society:\u2014\"On the Philippine alphabets,\" by Professor Kern;\u2014this learned paper was suggested by a publication on the subject entitled \"Contribucion para el estudio de los antiguos alfabetos filipinos, por T. H. Pardo de Tavera,\" and treats of the affinity of these alphabets to those of Sumatra, Java, Celebes and Kamboja. Dr. G. A. Wilken contributes a valuable article on circumcision as practised by the people of the Indian Archipelago, in which he shews that it has nothing to do with the Moslem rite. Lastly, there is a legend about Prince Sultan Manangkarang, in the dialect of Manangkarbau (transliterated text, translation and explanatory notes), the most interesting and probably the most archaic form of Malay speech. This article, extending over 156 pages, is not the least valuable of the materials for the study of that dialect that have been supplied by Mr. Van der Toorn, of Fort de Kock, in the Padang district. See for his other papers \"de Indische Gids,\" 1882, II, pp.742-76, and 1885, II, pp. 1027-34, 1163-78; the Batavian \"Tijdschrift,\" Vol. XXV, pp. 441-59, 466-83, 553-64; Vol. XXVI, pp. 205-33, 514-28; and the \"Verhandelingen van het Bataviaasch Genootschap,\" Vol. XLV, 1, where he has given the text, with translation and glossary, of another Manangkarbau tale called \"Manjan Ari.\" In Vol. XLI of the same serial is given the tale of Princess Balkis in the same dialect (text, transliteration, translation, and notes), edited by Mr. D. Gerth van Wijk. A collection of Manangkarbau conversations, with an introduction and glossary, was brought out by Professor Pijnappel in 1872. Since 1875, collections of riddles, pantuns, proverbs and other specimens of the dialect have been published in the Batavian \"Tijdschrift\" by L. K. Harmsen, Limburg-Brouwer, and J. Habbema (Vol. XXI, pp. 288-94, 480-533; Vol. XXIII, pp. 258-81; Vol. XXV, pp. 337-61, 417-31, 538-52; Vol. XXVI, pp. 168-81, 234-55, 564-70): while the fourth series of the Journal of the Institute of The Hague has brought several\ngood contributions to our knowledge of the di-\nW.

It is to be hoped that the\nwill be published separately, and thus become acces\nlarger circle of students.\n\nThe \"Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch Indie\" for 18\nseries of papers by J. A. B. Wiselius, on prisons an\nlabour in British India and the Dutch Indian pos\nOnly a few pages (I, 277-80) are given to the Strait\nments.\n\nFOLK-LORE OF CHINA.\n\nThe following circular has been issued by the\nSecretary in Hongkong of the Folk-Lore Society of G\ntain:\n\nHongkong, 7th June,\n\nSir,\u2014Having been appointed to act in this pa\nworld as local Secretary of the Folk-Lore Society o\nBritain, it has appeared to me after reflection that\npossible way of dealing effectively with the vast fie\nLore in China, which has received but slight cultivatio\nhands of western scholars, is to invite the co-operati\nEuropeans and Americans resident in China. There\nlittle doubt that, either by their position or influen\ncould materially contribute towards a thorough inves\nof a subject which is daily becoming of greater inte\nwhich is gradually assuming a place of no small imp\namong other branches of science.\nThe Folk-Lore of China is not only a study of great interest in itself, but the mass of materials it contains will, after careful collection and discrimination, be of great scientific value for purposes of comparative Folk-Lore. No attempt has ever been made to deal with this subject as a whole. What little has been written has, with a few notable exceptions, been generally of a local character. What is now proposed is to endeavour to obtain, as far as possible, collections of the lore peculiar to the different parts of China, and its dependencies. Each collection, while in itself highly instructive, will be chiefly important as forming a link in the chain of facts from which a general account of the Folk-Lore of China may be deduced. If willing helpers can be found to assist in the work of collection, the success of the scheme is ensured. Failure can only result from want of co-operation and support. It is, therefore, earnestly hoped that all will be ready to give their aid either by collecting and contributing themselves or by inducing others to do so.\n\nAs a first step towards obtaining a collection of Chinese Folk-Lore as complete as possible, and with a view to uniformity of action, I enclose, herewith in English and Chinese an arrangement of the subjects of Folk-Lore under four main divisions, sub-divided into minor groups. This arrangement has been borrowed from the publications of the Folk-Lore Society as appearing to be the one best adapted to China, though no doubt modifications and additions will suggest themselves to individual collectors. It is hoped, however, that it will serve as a useful guide and form a basis on which may be built a substantial structure of facts and generalisations.\n\nThe Chinese version is intended for circulation among the Chinese who, experience shows, evince a great interest in the subject when once they comprehend its aims and objects. Under the minor groups, examples have been given in order to facilitate inquiry.\n\nMy excuse for addressing you and asking your assistance is that, as you are interested in, as well as well acquainted with, the customs and manners of the Chinese, it seemed not unlikely that you would be willing to co-operate in the fur-\nNOTICE\n\nCopies of the under-mentioned work may be obtained from the Honorary Secretary, Singapore or Penang, price $5 to members, or $6.50 to purchasers who are not members of the Society:\n\nMISCELLANEOUS PAPERS\n\nRELATING TO\n\nINDO-CHINA.\n\nReprinted for the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society,\nFrom Dalrymple's \"Oriental Repertory,\" and the \"Asiatic Researches\"\nand \"Journal\" of the Asiatic Society of Bengal.\n\nTwo Vols., post 8vo.\n\nThe importance of placing within the reach of local students (often without access to libraries) a knowledge of what has been communicated to the Journals of learned Societies in past years, upon subjects having reference to the Malay Archipelago, has induced the Council of the Society (the literature in question being of manageable bulk) to reprint a series of papers, collected from various sources, relating to the Straits Settlements and Eastern Archipelago.\n\nCONTENTS.\n\nVolume I.\n\nI.
