K\u00e4chler as Treasurer of the Society in the place of Mr. C. Little, resigned.\n\nThe President announced that he had received five essays in competition for the Elliott Prize for Scientific Researches for the year 1897.\n\nSurgeon-Major A. Alcock exhibited some remarkable Deep Sea animals, and made the following remarks on their distribution:\n\nThe three specimens which I am exhibiting this evening are:\n\n(1). A Macrurus fish (Macrurus\u2014Mystaconurus\u2014cavernosus, Goode and Bean) belonging to the same order as the Cod-fishes.\n\n(2). A blind deep-sea Lobster (Phoberus cecus, A. M. Edw.), and\n\n(3). A gigantic deep sea Isopod Crustacean (Bathynomus giganteus, A. M. Edw).\n\nIn exhibiting them, what I wish to draw attention to is, not the numerous peculiarities of their structure, but the peculiarity of their Geographical Distribution.\n\nThe fish (Mystaconurus cavernosus) was first discovered by the U. S. Survey Steamer \u201cAlbatross\u201d in the Gulf of Mexico at a depth of 227 fathoms.\n\nThe Lobster (Phoberus cecus) was first discovered by the U. S. Survey Steamer \u201cBlake,\u201d off the Antilles at a depth of about 416 fms.\n\nThe Isopod (Bathynomus giganteus) was first discovered by the \u201cBlake\u201d at a depth of about 955 fathoms, also in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nNow the point that I think sufficiently remarkable for relation to this meeting is that these three animals (belonging to three different Orders and two different Phyla of the Animal Kingdom) first found in the depths of the Gulf of Mexico, are only elsewhere known to occur in Indian waters.\n\nIt is true that a form very closely related to, and perhaps identical with, Phoberus cecus, was dredged by the \u201cChallenger,\u201d at a depth of 800 fathoms, in the enclosed sea south of New Guinea, but that sea, as well as the Java seas and the Andaman sea, all belong to one and the same zoological region with the seas of India. So that if all three forms, instead of only one of them, were known to exist near New Guinea, the peculiarity of their distribution would hardly be affected.\nNow, how can the very curious distribution of these animals be explained?\n\nThe most obvious explanation is that as they all belong to the Deep Sea Fauna, they may be expected to have an almost unlimited range. It has been fairly well established that the animals that inhabit the depths of the ocean all live under almost uniform conditions, and that therefore there is no limit to their range from one unbroken ocean-bed to another.\n\nNumerous instances of deep-sea animals that have such an unlimited range are known; but as I prefer to confine myself to species that have been taken in Indian Seas and that, therefore, can be shown to you, I will only mention the following examples, specimens of which are here exhibited:\n\n*Bathyactis symmetrica* (Pourtales) a Fungid coral which according to the late Professor Moseley is \"apparently universally distributed in deep-water.\"\n\n*Porcellanaster caeruleus*, Wy. Thoms., a Starfish common to the depths of the North Atlantic and of the Andaman Sea.\n\n*Freyella benthophila*, Sladen, a Starfish common to the depths of the Pacific and Bay of Bengal.\n\n*Poromya tornata*, Jeff., a Lamellibranch mollusk common to the depths of the Atlantic and of the Bay of Bengal.\n\n*Puncturella asturiana*, Fisch., a Gastropod mollusk common to the depths of the West Indies, of the Bay of Biscay, and of the Laccadive Sea.\n\n*Calocaris macandreae*, Bell, a little crustacean distantly related to the Lobsters, which has been found in the northern recesses of the Irish Sea, in Scandinavian deep-waters, in the Gulf of St. Laurence, off the coast of New Zealand and off the Laccadive Islands.\n\n*Parapagurus abyssorum*, a Hermit crab that has been found all over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans at great depths.\n\n*Macrurus laevis*, a fish related to the Cod-fishes, whose range includes the Scandinavian, Irish and Mediterranean Seas, the depths off the coast of Brazil, and the Laccadive and Andaman Seas.\n\nNow it is quite possible, and even probable, that in the discovery of the Gulf of Mexico species *Macrurus cavernosus*, *Bathynomus giganteus* and *Phoberus cecus* in Indian Seas, we have merely another illustration of the wide range of species modified for life under deep sea conditions; but there is another possible explanation that should not be lost sight of.\n\nIn the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society for August 1895 (Vol. LI. No. 203) Dr. J. W. Gregory adduces several telling\narguments, based principally upon the affinities of the fossil corals of Barbadoes with the fossil corals of the Mediterranean basin and with corals still living in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean, in support of the view that, in or shortly before Miocene times, a Mediterranean Sea extended from America eastwards, and included both the present Caribbean and Mediterranean basins. In this Mediterranean Sea, the present North and South Atlantic Oceans were represented by bays running north and south.\n\nNow is it possible that Phoberus, Bathynomus, and Mystaconurus cavernosus are remnants of the deep fauna of this sea? The question seems to be a not unreasonable one, especially as it is strengthened by the curious distribution of some other forms of which specimens are exhibited here to-night. These are:\n\n1. *Diplacanthopoma brachysoma*, a fish distantly related to the Cod-fishes, which is only known to occur (a) off Pernambuco (at the north-east angle of Brazil) in 350 fms., and (b) in the Andaman Sea in 490 fms.\n\n2. *Flabellum laciniatum*, a Turbinolid coral which has been found living (a) in the Norwegian and North Atlantic Seas, and (b) off the east and west coasts of India at 400 to 700 fathoms. This species is also fossil in the (Pliocene) deposits of the Mediterranean basin.\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1. *Two copper-plate grants of Ratnap\u0101la of Pragjyotisha in \u0100\u015b\u0101m.*\u2014By Dr. A.

On Taboo and customs connected therewith amongst the Santals.\u2014By The Rev. P. O. Bodding, Mohulpahari, Santal Parganas.\n\nABSTRACT.\n\nThe custom of tabooring certain names, animals, things, etc., is found amongst the Santals.\n\nNames are tabooed in the following cases: certain brothers and sisters-in-law, viz., (1) a man and his younger brother's wife, (2) a man and his wife's younger brother's wife, (3) a woman and her younger sister's husband, and (4) a woman and her younger brother's wife; and husband and wife are prohibited from mentioning each other's names, not only when they are speaking to or of each other, but always when they may have to mention these particular names.\n\nThe custom is very strictly observed, the breaking of it being\u2014so far as regards brothers and sisters-in-law\u2014considered a great sin, which the Santals believe will be punished both in this world and the next.\n\nThe manner in which they seek to avoid naming these particular names is curious and fanciful; as far as can now be ascertained the custom has not, however, had any influence on the vocabulary of the Santal language; a result of this custom is, that the Santals very frequently get second names,\u2014although not from this cause only,\u2014and these second names are then constantly used.\n\nThe Santals consider this custom as a special manner for the relations mentioned honoring each other, that is to say, they are to consider each other as sacrosanct, and according to their notions the custom is also mutual honoring; but as certain other relations between whom an analogous honoring should be expected, do not observe this custom, it seems clear, that this peculiar honoring has a deeper cause.\n\nBesides not naming each other's names these brothers and sisters-in-law have various rules imposed on them which all are to prevent these relations from seeing each other in any too familiar position and from indulging in any familiarity towards each other, i.e., to prevent them from being tempted to sexual sin with respect to each other.\n\nNow the Santals buy their wives, and the wife is the property of her husband. As will be shown in the paper, there are many circumstances which seem to indicate, that the tabooring of names between these brothers and sisters-in-law, and all customs imposed on them in order to\nprevent any kind of familiarity between them, have as their ultimate cause a wish to protect the weaker relation and his property from being encroached on, or to protect the rights of the first buyer uninfringed.\n\nAs far as regards husband and wife, the custom of tabooring each other's names seems to be of another nature than with the relations just mentioned. The Santals feel the difference themselves and describe it negatively by saying, that if husband and wife break the custom it is only dishonoring each other, but if the other relatives break it, it is sin. The custom is most likely meant for honoring, but it may be, that in this instance it has originally been borrowed from the Hindoo custom, that a wife is prohibited from naming the name of her husband, the peculiar social and family position of a Santal wife having caused the custom to be made obligatory for the husband also.\n\nBesides the tabooring of names mentioned, the Santals in some cases taboo the animals, plants, things, etc., i.e., the totems which have given names to their septs and subsepts; they are prohibited from killing, eating, carrying, cutting or in some way or other using them.\n\nFurther, almost all sacrifices are taboo for the women who are in most cases forbidden even to eat the flesh of the sacrificed animals. Men of other totems are also prohibited from eating the flesh of sacrifices offered to the different totemistic gods or spirits.\n\nThe sacred trees of the holy grove are taboo for all women, and women belonging to other households are prohibited from entering the bhitar, a small closet found inside every Santal dwelling house, where offerings are made to the ancestors.\n\nThe paper will be published in full, in Journal, Part III.\n\n7. Note on the Occurrence in India of the Dwarf Goose (Anser erythropus) with Exhibition of living Specimen.\u2014By F. Finn, B.A., F.Z.S., Deputy Superintendent of the Indian Museum.\n\nThe Goose which I have the honour of exhibiting to the Society tonight is a very rare visitor to India, no instance of its occurrence within our limits having apparently been recorded since the publication of Mr. Hume's \"Game Birds and Wildfowl\" nearly twenty years ago; and even in that work less than a dozen specimens are mentioned as having been obtained up to date.\n\nI was therefore very pleased at being able to secure, on New Year's Day, the bird I now exhibit, together with two others, which are at present in the Duck House at the Alipore Zoological Gardens. The specimens were obtained from a bird-dealer in the Provision Bazaar who constantly imports birds from up country; I have since heard that these came from somewhere in the direction of Rawal Pindi. The\nvendor, who was well aware of the value of the birds, said that these were the first which had been sent to Calcutta.\n\nAll these birds (they appear to be a male and two females) are adult and in good condition, the plumage being perfect except the primary quills, which have been clipped. This is unfortunate, as it obscures the most notable structural feature of the species, which, although the smallest member of the genus *Anser*, as commonly restricted, has proportionally the longest wings.\n\nThe small size of these birds, however, and the extension of the white patch on the forehead up to the level of a line drawn between the eyes, will at once distinguish them from the White-fronted Goose (*Anser albifrons*) another rare Indian goose, and the only one with which the present species could possibly be confounded.\n\nIn the British Museum Catalogue of Birds, Vol. XXVII, in which the Ducks, &c., are treated by Count Salvadori, no difference in the colour of the \"soft parts\" between the Dwarf Goose and the White-fronted is mentioned. In the bird at present before us, however, it will be noticed that the bill is of a beautiful rose-pink, not orange, as is stated to be the case with the larger species; and the eyelids, of the colour of which nothing is said in the work referred to, are lemon-yellow. In its dark eyes and orange feet this bird agrees with the description of its larger relative.\n\nThe other two birds obtained have the soft parts similar, and as they are, as above stated, adult, this might be taken as the typical colouration for the species, were it not that the colour of the soft parts is known to be sometimes variable in geese of this genus.\n\nThe identity of the present specimen having been established, it will now rejoin its companions at the Zoological Gardens, and though the species has in summer a high northern range, it is to be hoped that these birds will thrive, since Bar-headed Geese (*Anser indicus*) which Mr. Hume found did not stand the hot weather very well in his experience, have nevertheless lived for years in the Alipore Collection in the same house in which the present birds will now replace them.\n\n8. Contributions from the Chemical Laboratory, Presidency College, Calcutta. On Double Bisulphate of Copper and Sodium.\u2014By Candra Bhusan Bhaduri, B.A., and Jyoti Bhusan Bhaduri, M.A., Prem Oaid, Roy Caid Scholar. Communicated by Alex. Pedler, F.R.S.\n\nAbstract.\n\nThe authors in this paper describe principally the yellow salt obtained by the action of sodium thiosulphate on copper sulphate or acetate, and find that its formula is $7\\text{Cu}_2\\text{S}_2\\text{O}_3 \\cdot 5\\text{Na}_2\\text{S}_2\\text{O}_3 \\cdot 8\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ and not\nCu_2S_3O_5 Na_2S_3O_5 2CuS: as given by Kessel. They also find that the above double thiosulphate when treated with caustic soda yields cuprous oxide, which again is soluble in excess of sodium thiosulphate. When this solution is boiled cuprous sulphide is precipitated. The acid cuprous thiosulphate could not be obtained by the action of sodium thiosulphate on a concentrated solution of copper sulphate as mentioned by Von Haer.\n\nThe yellow salt described above dissolves easily in dilute hydrochloric acid. On adding concentrated hydrochloric acid or acetic acid to this solution, a perfectly white stable salt is obtained conforming to the formula 9Cu_2S_3O_5 5Na_2S_3O_5 8NaCl 12H_2O and not 3Cu_2S_3O_5 2Na_2S_3O_5 4NaCl 8H_2O as claimed by Siewert.\n\nThe authors also obtained a faintly yellowish white salt of the composition Cu_2S_3O_5 Na_2S_3O_5 2\\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) H_2O by an altogether different method from that of Russel.\n\nThe paper will be published in full, in the Journal, Part II.\n\n9.

Watt and Mr. J. Mann to be Scrutineers.\n\nThe President then called upon the Secretary to read the Annual Report.\nANNUAL REPORT FOR 1897.\n\nThe Council of the Asiatic Society have the honour to submit the following Report on the state and progress of the Society's affairs during the past year:\n\nMember List.\n\nDuring the year under review, 16 Ordinary Members were elected, 12 withdrew, 7 died, 3 were removed from the list under Rule 40, being more than three years absent from India. There was thus a net loss of 6 Ordinary Members during the year. The total number of Members at the close of 1897, was 288, against 294 for the preceding year; of these 106 were Residents, 115 Non-Residents, 9 Foreign, 22 Life, 35 Absent from India and 1 Special Non-Subscribing Member, as will be seen from the following table, which also shows the fluctuations in the numbers of Ordinary Members during the past six years:\n\n| Year | Paying | Non-Paying | Grand Total |\n|------|--------|------------|-------------|\n|      | Resident | Non-Resident | Foreign | Total | Life | Absent | Special Non-Subscribing | Total |\n| 1892 | ... | 115 | 127 | 11 | 253 | 22 | 33 | 2 | 57 | 310 |\n| 1893 | ... | 116 | 123 | 12 | 251 | 22 | 33 | 2 | 57 | 308 |\n| 1894 | ... | 98 | 125 | 12 | 235 | 22 | 36 | 2 | 60 | 295 |\n| 1895 | ... | 108 | 122 | 12 | 242 | 23 | 31 | 1 | 55 | 297 |\n| 1896 | ... | 105 | 119 | 11 | 235 | 23 | 35 | 1 | 59 | 294 |\n| 1897 | ... | 106 | 115 | 9 | 230 | 22 | 35 | 1 | 58 | 288 |\n\nThe seven Ordinary Members, the loss of whom by death during the year we have to regret, were Nawab Sayid Asghar Ali Diler Jang Khan Bahadur, Sir Ananda Ram Gajapati, Prince Mahomed Firukh Shah, Mr. S. E. Peal, Raja Lachman Singh, Mr. W. T. Taylor and Captain E. Y. Watson.\n\nThe lists of Honorary Members, Special Honorary Centenary Members and Associate Members, continue unaltered from last year, there having been no casualties; their numbers stand at 24, 5, 10, respectively.\nThe names of Dr. J. Macgowan, Mr. A. Murray and the Rev. J. Porter were removed from the list of Corresponding Members, their addresses being long since unknown. Professor E. von Schlagintweit is now the only Corresponding Member of the Society.\n\nNo Members compounded for their subscriptions during the year.\n\nIndian Museum.\n\nNo presentations were made over to the Indian Museum.\n\nThere were two changes among the Trustees caused by the resignations of Dr. D. D. Cunningham and Mr. C. Little, in consequence of their leaving India, and Mr. R. D. Oldham and Mr. G. W. K\u00fcchler were appointed to fill the vacant offices.\n\nFinance.\n\nThe accounts of the Society are shown in Statement No. 1, in the Appendix, under the usual heads.\n\nStatement No. 8 contains the Balance Sheet of the Society and of the different funds administered through it.\n\nThe Budget Estimate for 1897 was taken at the following figures:\u2014\nReceipts Rs. 17,800. Expenditure Rs. 16,700.\n\nThe actual results were found to be\u2014Receipts Rs. 16,713-10-6 and Expenditure Rs. 20,130-11-8.\n\nThe receipts show a decrease of Rs. 1,086-5-6 while the expenditure shows an increase of Rs. 3,430-11-8 on the Budget Estimate.\n\nAs only 16 new members were elected during the year, there is a reduction of Rs. 744 under the head of receipts from \"Subscriptions,\" \"Sale of Publications\" shows a slight decrease of Rs. 22-14-6. \"Rent of Rooms\" is also below the estimate by Rs. 400. This is due to the non-receipt of rent from the Photographic Society of India for four months.\n\nOn the Expenditure side, the items of \"Postage,\" \"Freight,\" \"Contingencies,\" \"Books,\" \"Binding,\" \"Journal Part I,\" \"Journal Part II,\" \"Proceedings,\" and \"Circulars,\" show an increase. Owing to the purchase of paulins and providing the peons with new clothing for the cold weather there is an increase of Rs. 202-3-4 under the head of \"Contingencies.\" \"Books\" were estimated at Rs. 1,500, whilst the expenditure was Rs. 3,284-3-11. This was expected, as the expenditure last year under \"Books\" was Rs. 564-5-0 only. A remittance of \u00a3100 was sent to Messrs. Luzac and Co. for books supplied and heavy local purchases of books were made during the year. \"Journal,\" Part I, has exceeded the estimate by a large sum of Rs. 1,579-4-6. This heavy expenditure is due to the printing of an unusual number of plates and\nfor payment of Baptist Mission Press bills not presented during last year. \"Journal,\" Part II, has exceeded the budget by a large sum of Rs. 1,408-2-6 which is accounted for by the printing charges of No. 1 of 1897 amounting to Rs. 1,476-9-6. The \"Proceedings\" also show an increase of Rs. 186-14-0. This is due to the payment of Baptist Mission Press bills not presented during last year. \"Circulars,\" has exceeded the budget owing to the printing of Wilson's Descriptive Catalogue of Paintings, &c., in the Society's Rooms.\n\nThere were two items of extraordinary expenditure during 1897 not provided for in the Budget. Rs. 707-10-3 was remitted to Mr. C. J. Rodgers in part payment for preparing the Society's Coin Catalogue and Rs. 50-8-0 was spent for purchasing certain coins for the Society's Coin Cabinet.\n\nThe actual expenditure on the Journal and Proceedings was as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Journal} & \\\\\n\\text{Part I} & \\ldots \\quad \\ldots \\quad \\text{Rs. } 3,679 \\quad 4 \\quad 6 \\\\\n\\text{Part II} & \\ldots \\quad \\ldots \\quad \\text{3,508} \\quad 2 \\quad 6 \\\\\n\\text{Part III} & \\ldots \\quad \\ldots \\quad \\text{699} \\quad 2 \\quad 6 \\\\\n\\text{Proceedings} & \\ldots \\quad \\ldots \\quad \\text{1,186} \\quad 14 \\quad 0 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTotal Rs. 9,073 7 6\n\nagainst a budget provision of Rs. 8,200.\n\nThe Budget Estimate of probable ordinary Receipts and Expenditure for 1898 has been fixed as follows:\u2014Receipts Rs. 17,700. Expenditure Rs. 16,682.\n\nOn the receipt side, the estimated income under the head of \"Rent of Rooms\" is increased by Rs. 400, as it is expected to receive this year the four months rent due by the Photographic Society of India.\n\n\"Subscriptions\" has been slightly reduced taking into account the numbers of members elected last year. \"Interest on Investments\" has been reduced by Rs. 200, as during the year it will be necessary to sell off Government Securities to pay for Repairs of damages caused by the earthquake.\n\nOn the expenditure side, the changes in last year's estimate are small. \"Lighting\" has been increased by Rs. 22, as some gas bills of last year have not yet been presented for payment. \"Freight\" and \"Contingencies\" are based upon the actuals of the last year.\n\nThere will, however, be one extraordinary item of expenditure to be dealt with during the year 1898. Extensive repairs to the Society's buildings had to be undertaken during last year owing to damage caused by the earthquake.\nThe details of the Budget Estimate are as follows:\n\n**Receipts.**\n\n| Description               | Amount |\n|---------------------------|--------|\n| Subscriptions             | Rs. 7,000 0 0 |\n| Sale of Publications      | Rs. 600 0 0 |\n| Interest of Investments   | Rs. 5,500 0 0 |\n| Rent of Rooms             | Rs. 1,500 0 0 |\n| Government Allowances     | Rs. 3,000 0 0 |\n| Miscellaneous             | Rs. 100 0 0 |\n\nTotal Rs. 17,700 0 0\n\n**Expenditure.**\n\n| Description               | Amount |\n|---------------------------|--------|\n| Salaries                  | Rs. 3,500 0 0 |\n| Commission                | Rs. 400 0 0 |\n| Pension                   | Rs. 52 0 0 |\n| Stationery                | Rs. 150 0 0 |\n| Lighting                  | Rs. 70 0 0 |\n| Municipal Taxes           | Rs. 819 0 0 |\n| Postage                   | Rs. 600 0 0 |\n| Freight                   | Rs. 40 0 0 |\n| Meetings                  | Rs. 80 0 0 |\n| Contingencies             | Rs. 200 0 0 |\n| Books                     | Rs. 1,500 0 0 |\n| Local Periodicals         | Rs. 16 0 0 |\n| Binding                   | Rs. 750 0 0 |\n| Journal, Part I           | Rs. 2,100 0 0 |\n| \" II                      | Rs. 2,100 0 0 |\n| \" III                     | Rs. 3,000 0 0 |\n| Proceedings               | Rs. 1,000 0 0 |\n| Printing Circulars, &c.   | Rs. 200 0 0 |\n| Registration Fee          | Rs. 5 0 0 |\n| Auditor's Fee             | Rs. 100 0 0 |\n\nTotal Rs. 16,682 0 0\n\n**Extraordinary Expenditure.**\n\n| Description               | Amount |\n|---------------------------|--------|\n| Repairs                   | Rs. 5,528 0 0 |\n\nTotal Rs. 22,210 0 0\nLondon Agency.\n\nThe number of copies of parts of the Journal, of the Proceedings, and of the Bibliotheca Indica, sent to Messrs.

I confess that when you did me the honour, last year, of nominating me to the post of President of your Society, it was the prospect that I should have to deliver such an address which made me hesitate before I accepted your honouring proposal. Looking over the annual addresses delivered within the last ten years, I notice that they have been gradually growing to very large dimensions. The last two addresses occupy respectively, in print, 154 and 170 of the pages of our Proceedings. The thought that possibly it might be expected of me to \"break this record\" caused me many misgivings, because I felt that I lacked both the ability and the leisure to do so. Indeed I felt rather inclined at one time to initiate a new departure by returning to the previous long-prevailing custom of the President making only a few brief observations on the past year's proceedings of the Society. But my courage failed me; I felt I must leave it to some one of greater weight than myself to make the change; but I cannot help thinking that a return to the old practice would be wise in the interests of the Society. At this, the busiest time of the year, there should be no stumbling-block put in the way of those whom we desire to take upon themselves the responsible post of President of our Society.\n\nThere are two preliminary remarks which I wish to make. One refers to the Report of the Council which has just been read. You will have observed that we close our accounts with a deficit of Rs. 3,417-1-2. This is a rather serious matter, considering that the regular condition\nof our finances is that our income just about balances our expenditure. The deficit has been due to two co-operating causes: a decrease in our receipts and an increase in our expenditure. The main cause of the former is the reduction of Rs. 744 under the head of subscriptions from members. Only sixteen new members joined the Society during the past year. It seems to me a cause of much regret that the Society does not receive as much support as it deserves, especially from some of the scientific departments. I would earnestly impress upon our members the necessity of increasing the resources of the Society by inducing larger accessions to our numbers. The main cause of the increase in our expenditure has been the extraordinary cost of publishing our Journal Parts I. and II. In Part I. eight numbers (including Extras) have been issued instead of the usual four, and in Part II. one number, an important one, was unusually large. From one point of view, of course, this activity is very satisfactory; but it caused the budget allowance to be exceeded by nearly Rs. 3,000. I trust that our Secretaries, who so ably edit our Journals, will see the necessity of endeavouring in the ensuing year to keep within the limits of their allowances. There is a very special reason for the practice of economy. In company with the rest of Calcutta our Society suffered heavily in the late earthquake. Our premises were severely damaged, and we had to incur a heavy bill for repairs done by Messrs. Macintosh Burn & Co. This bill, amounting to upwards of Rs. 5,500, will have to be paid in the course of the year, and a strong effort must be made to meet it without crippling the resources of the Society. As one means of doing so I would suggest the advisability of selling some of our oil-paintings. There are among them, I understand, a few of considerable value, one, for example, of a rural scene by the younger Morland. Such a disposal of them, I venture to think, would be not only in the interests of the Society, but also of the pictures themselves, the proper preservation of which, in the Calcutta climate, is a matter of great difficulty.\n\nThe other point concerns a duty which it gives me very great pleasure to discharge. It is to remind you of the valuable services of our officers given by them to the Society voluntarily and at the sacrifice of their private time and leisure. Mr. C. R. Wilson was our General Secretary till the middle of April, when he was succeeded first by Dr. A. R. S. Anderson and afterwards by Dr. A. W. Alcock. Dr. Ranking acted as our Philological Secretary till June, when he left Calcutta on leave, and Dr. Bloch was appointed. Mah\u0101mahop\u0101dhyaya Hara Prasad Shastri carried on the duties of Joint-Philological Secretary throughout the year; so did Mr. F. Finn and Mr. L. de Nic\u00e9ville those\nof Natural History Secretary and Anthropological Secretary respectively. Mr. C. Little continued our Treasurer for another year with conspicuous zeal. To all these gentlemen I desire to offer my warm acknowledgments for the help afforded me in presiding over the affairs of the Society, and I would also ask you to pass a cordial vote of thanks for their services to the Society during the past year.\n\nIn thinking over what I should make the subject of my annual address to you, it has occurred to me that perhaps I might be able to say something that would interest you and at the same time not take up too much of your time, if I were to confine myself to those departments of research in which I have been to some extent a worker myself, and to review the period from 1883 up to this year. I have chosen this period, both because it is characterised by special progress in those departments, and because the preceding period of one hundred years was reviewed by me in 1883 in the Centenary Review. The departments I refer to are those of the History and Literature of Jainism and Buddhism, and of Indian Archaeology and Epigraphy. To these I will add some account of the recent Ethnographic and Linguistic Surveys, as well as of the History of Old Calcutta.\n\nJainism and Buddhism.\u2014A very great advance, during the period under review, has been made with respect to our knowledge of Jainism. Jainism is the great Indian rival of Buddhism, and is as ancient an institution as the latter, though until quite recent years its very existence before the middle ages was denied by the learned world, and even at the present time, by the side of the world-wide fame of its illustrious rival, it is hardly more than a name to the general public. It owes in the main its rehabilitation as one of the most ancient monastic organizations of India to the researches of Professor Jacobi, which were seconded by Hofrath Prof. B\u00fchler, myself, and others.\u00b9\n\nThe results of these may be thus summarised.\n\nThe founder of Jainism is commonly known by the title of Mah\u0101v\u012bra, under which he is usually referred to in the sacred books of the Jains. His personal name, however, was Vardham\u0101na. In the books of the rival Order of the Buddhists, he is designated the N\u0101taputta, i.e., \"the son of the chief of the N\u0101\u1e6da clan of K\u1e63atriyas.\" For like Buddha, Mah\u0101v\u012bra was of high aristocratic descent, the son-\n\n\u00b9 For detailed information see Prof. Jacobi's Translations of the \u0100c\u0101r\u0101\u1e45ga and Kalpa S\u016btras (1884), and the Uttar\u0101dhyayana and S\u016btrak\u1e5bt\u0101\u1e45ga S\u016btras (1895), Prof. B\u00fchler's Indian Sect of the Jains (1887), and my own Translation of the Up\u0101sakad\u0101ga S\u016btra (1888); also Prof. Jacobi's Kalpa S\u016btra, published in 1879, and a paper of his on the Origin of the \u0100v\u0101mbara and Dig\u0101mbara Sects in the Journal of the German Oriental Society, Vol. XXXVIII, 1884.\nof a R\u0101j\u0101 or petty king. His father Siddh\u0101rtha was the head of a K\u1e63atriya clan, the so-called N\u0101tas or N\u0101yas, who were settled in the suburb Koll\u0101ga of the once flourishing town of Vai\u00e7\u0101li, whence it is that Mah\u0101v\u012bra is occasionally designated the V\u0113s\u0101liya or \"the man of Vai\u00e7\u0101li.\" Vai\u00e7\u0101li is the modern B\u0101s\u0101r\u012b, about 27 miles north of Patna. Anciently it consisted of three distinct portions, called Vai\u00e7\u0101li, Kundag\u0101ma and V\u0101niyag\u0101ma, and forming, in the main, the quarters inhabited by the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, K\u1e63atriya and Ban\u012bya castes respectively. At the present day it has entirely disappeared, but the sites of its three component parts are still marked by the villages of B\u0101s\u0101r\u012b, Basunkund and Baniy\u0101. While it existed, it had a curious political constitution; it was an oligarchic republic; its government was vested in a Senate, composed of the heads of the resident K\u1e63atriya clans, and presided over by an officer who had the title of King and was assisted by a Viceroy and a Commander-in-Chief. Siddh\u0101rtha was married to Tr\u012b\u00e7\u0101l\u0101, who was a daughter of Cet\u0101ka, the then governing King of the republic. From her Mah\u0101v\u012bra was born in or about 599 B.C., and he was, therefore, a very highly connected personage. This accounts for the fact that, like his rival Buddha, in the earlier years of his ministry, he addressed himself chiefly to the members of the aristocracy and to his fellow castemen, the K\u1e63atriyas. He married, and his wife Ya\u00e7od\u0101 bore him a daughter Anojj\u0101 who was married to Jam\u0101li, a fellow nobleman and, later on, one of his followers. He seems to have lived in the parental house, till his father died, and his elder brother Nandivardhana succeeded to what principality they owned. Then at the age of thirty, he, with the consent of the head of his house, entered the spiritual career, which in India, just as in Europe, offered a field for the ambition of younger sons. In Koll\u0101ga, the N\u0101ya clan kept up a religious establishment, doubtless similar to those still existing in the present day. There is one, near Calcutta, in the Maniktola suburb, which is probably known to most of us. Such establishments consist of a park or garden, enclosing a temple and rows of cells for the accommodation of monks, sometimes also a st\u016bpa or sepulchral monument. The whole complex is not unusually called a Caitya, though this is strictly only the name of the shrine within it. The Caitya of the N\u0101ya clan was called Duipal\u0101sa, and it was kept up for the accommodation of the monks of P\u0101r\u00e7van\u0101tha's order, to whom the N\u0101ya clan professed allegiance.\n\nMah\u0101v\u012bra, on adopting the monk's vocation, would naturally retire to the Duipal\u0101sa Caitya and join the Order of P\u0101r\u00e7van\u0101tha. But the observances of that order do not seem to have satisfied his notions of stringency, one of the cardinal points of which was absolute nudity.\nSo after a trial of one year, he separated, and discarding his clothes, wandered about the country of North and South Bih\u0101r, even as far as modern R\u0101jmahal. Considering his tenet of absolute nudity, it is no wonder that it took twelve years before he succeeded in gaining a following that acknowledged his divine mission. It was now that he obtained the title of Mah\u0101v\u012bra or 'Great Hero,' and was acknowledged to be a Jina and K\u0113valin, i.e., a holy and omniscient person. It is his title of Jina or 'Spiritual Conqueror,' from which the names Jainism and Jain, by which his system and his sect are now generally known, are derived; and it is Mah\u0101v\u012bra's initial connection with P\u0101rvan\u0101tha's order which accounts for the fact that the latter saint is reckoned in the Jain hierarchy as the immediate predecessor of Mah\u0101v\u012bra, and that his image is set up in so many Jain temples. The famous sacred hill of P\u0101rvan\u0101tha (or Paresn\u0101th, as it is commonly called) with its Jain temples also takes its name from him.\n\nThe last thirty years of his life Mah\u0101v\u012bra passed in teaching his religious system and organising his order of ascetics, which was patronised chiefly by those princes with whom he was related through his mother, the kings of Videha, Magadha and Anga, i.e., those of North and South Bih\u0101r. In the towns and villages which lay in these parts he spent almost the whole period of his ministry, though he extended his travels as far north as \u0100r\u0101vasti, near the Nepalese frontier, and perhaps as far south as the Paresn\u0101th hill. The area of his ministry, therefore, practically coincides with that of his great contemporary Buddha. His life on the whole, was an uneventful one. With Buddha, who, as we now see, was his most formidable rival, he does not appear to have come into any prominent conflict. The Jain sacred books hardly notice him. On the other hand, they tell us of a fierce hostility between Mah\u0101v\u012bra and another great spiritual chief of those days. This was G\u014ds\u0101la, the son of a Mankhali or beggar, who had set up as the head of a section of the \u0100jivika order of monks, an order which at that time and for some subsequent centuries was so important as to be mentioned in one of A\u015boka's pillar edicts about 234 B.C., but which has long since ceased to exist. This G\u014ds\u0101la appears to have been the first who attached himself to Mah\u0101v\u012bra when the latter commenced his naked peregrinations. But after following Mah\u0101v\u012bra for six years, he quarrelled with his master, and set up as a chief of ascetics himself, and that, two years earlier than Mah\u0101v\u012bra himself ventured to do. This conduct naturally enough explains the intense hostility of Mah\u0101v\u012bra, who resented the presumption of his former disciple in taking precedence of his master. Besides G\u014ds\u0101la, the apostate, Mah\u0101v\u012bra had\n\n---\n\n3 I should mention that Prof. Jacobi holds a slightly different view of Gos\u0101la's position. According to him Gos\u0101la and Mah\u0101v\u012bra were two independent sect\neleven chief disciples, who all remained true to him, and who are said to have, between them, instructed 4,200 \u0100c\u0101ryas or monks; but only one of them, named Sudharman, survived his master, and it is through him that Jainism has been continued to the present day. Mah\u0101v\u012bra died in the seventy-second year of his life, in the small town of P\u0101v\u0101, in the Patna district, which is still considered one of the most sacred spots by the Jains. The traditional dates of his birth and death are 599 B.C. and 527 B.C. As modern research has shown they cannot be far wrong. The corresponding dates for Buddha, who lived to the age of eighty, are 557 and 477 B.C. It is certain that the two men were contemporaries, and that Mah\u0101v\u012bra died some years before Buddha. The former, like his great contemporary, must have been an eminently impressive personality. This accounts for his great success as a sect founder. He certainly succeeded in eventually bringing over to his way of thinking the whole order of P\u0101r\u1e47avan\u0101tha, so that the name of Nirgrantha or \"one without any ties,\" which originally belonged to that order, attached itself to the order of Mah\u0101v\u012bra. The only essential point of difference between them was the question of wearing a modicum of clothes. The followers of P\u0101r\u1e47avan\u0101tha appear to have yielded that point for a time. The difference, however, being one on a point of the merest decency, necessarily continued to subsist in a dormant state, till a few centuries later it woke up again and, as we shall see further on, led to the great division of the Jain order into the \u0100v\u0101t\u0101mbaras and Digambaras or the 'White-clothed' and 'Unclothed ones.' The term Nirgrantha or Nigantha, indeed, was the name by which the Jains were originally known. They are mentioned under that name in the same pillar edict of A\u015boka, about 234 B.C., which, as I have already remarked, also names the \u0100jivika monks; and it remained their name for many centuries afterwards, for Hiuen Tsiang, in the seventh century A.D., still knows them under no other name. How it came to fall into disuse, and to give place to the comparatively modern name Jain has not yet been explained.\n\nI will notice, in passing, the coincidence between Christ and Mah\u0101v\u012bra with respect to the number twelve of their disciples which in either case includes an apostate. An interdependence of Christianity and Jainism, I believe, has never been seriously propounded, as has been done in the case of Buddhism with respect to similar coincidences. Such coincidences are apt to be urged too far; and founders, who only associated for six years with the intention of combining their sects and fusing them into one; but that at last they quarrelled, probably on the question who was to be the leader of the united sect; and thus their bitter hostility is accounted for.\nthe instance I have noted is an instructive one in that respect: isolated coincidences possess very little evidential force. With regard to Buddhism and Jainism there are numerous coincidences in smaller details between the lives and doctrines of Buddha and Mah\u0101v\u012bra; and this circumstance was long considered a good reason for discrediting the story of the latter and of the early existence of the Jain sect. But the sketch of Mah\u0101v\u012bra's life which I have given above shows that in the main it was entirely different from Buddha's.\n\nBefore touching on the alleged doctrinal and ceremonial coincidences, it may be well to point out that neither Buddhism nor Jainism are religions in the strict sense of that word. They are rather monastic organizations. They are orders of begging fraternities, in many respects similar to the Dominicans and Franciscans among ourselves. Both were founded at the end of the sixth and beginning of the fifth centuries B.C. That period was a very active one in Northern India with respect to religious matters. The times were rife with religious movements. Many monastic orders sprung up: Buddhism and Jainism were only two among them, though they were the most important and most enduring. A third contemporary order, that of the \u0100jivikas, which only enjoyed a transitory existence, has been already mentioned by me incidentally. It must not be thought, however, that the institution of monasticism was any innovation on the existing religious conditions of the country. That institute formed an essential part of the original Brahmanism. The old Brahmanic religion ordained man's life to be spent in four consecutive stages, called \u0100c\u0101ramas. A man was to commence life as a religious student, then to proceed to be a householder, next to go into retirement as an anchorite, and finally to spend the declining years of his life as a wandering Sany\u0101sin or mendicant. These Sany\u0101sins or Brahmanic mendicants form the prototype of the great monastic orders that arose in the sixth century B.C., the only difference apparently being that the Brahmanic mendicants never formed themselves into such large organisations as the Buddhists and Jains. The rules and observances which were prescribed for the former were either adopted or imitated by the latter. It is this circumstance which explains most of the coincidences that have been noticed between the Buddhists and Jains: they followed the same model. Thus to mention but one striking example, the rule of ahims\u0101 or 'respect for life' which forms such a prominent feature in Buddhism and even more so in Jainism, is one which was binding on all Brahmanic mendicants. In course of time a tendency arose in Brahmanism to limit the entry into the stage\n\nFor another curious coincidence, relating to the parable of the Three Merchants, see Jacobi's Translation of the Uttar\u0101dhyayana S\u016btra, p. 29.\nof a mendicant to persons of the Brahman caste. It is probably this circumstance which first led to the formation of non-brahmanic orders such as those of the Buddhists and Jains, which were chiefly and originally intended for persons of the second or K\u1e63atriya caste, though eventually other caste-men were also admitted. It is easy to understand that these non-brahmanic orders would not be looked upon by the Sany\u0101sins as quite their equals, even when they were quite as orthodox as themselves, and on the other hand that this treatment by the Brahmanic ascetics would beget in their rivals a tendency to dissent and even to opposition. Thus the Buddhists and Jains were not only led to discard the performance of religious ceremonies which was also done by the Brahmanic mendicants, but to go further and even discontinue the reading of the Veda\u015b. It was this latter practice which really forced them outside the pale of Brahmanism. The still very prevalent notion that Buddhism and Jainism were reformatory movements, and that, more especially, they represented a revolt against the tyranny of caste, is quite erroneous. They were only a protest against the caste exclusiveness of the Brahmanic ascetics; but caste as such, and as existing outside their orders, was fully acknowledged by them. Even inside their orders, admission, though professedly open to all, was practically limited to the higher castes. It is also significant for the attitude of these orders to the Brahmanic institutions of the country, that though in spiritual matters their so-called lay-adherents were bound to their guidance, yet with regard to ceremonies, such as those of birth, marriage and death, they had to look for service to their old Brahmanic priests. The Buddhist or Jain monk functionated as the spiritual director to their respective lay communities, but the Brahmans were their priests.\n\nIt will thus be seen that the points of resemblance, undoubtedly existing between the orders of the Buddhists and Jains, are the natural result of the surrounding conditions under which they both arose and lived. Their points of difference are numerous, both in regard to doctrine and practice. They are so many, and often so minute and technical, that it would be difficult for me to render them intelligible within a small compass; nor would such an exposition be of any general interest. Those whom it may interest, will find the subject fully and ably discussed by Professor Jacobi in the Introductions to his Translations (see footnote, on p. 3). I may mention, however, two points which I believe have not been elsewhere noticed, but which, to my mind, very clearly bring out the extreme difference in the character and practice of the two orders. There is a celebrated term common to both the Buddhists and Jains: the term tri-ratna or \"the three jewels.\" With the former\nthese are Buddha, the Law and the Order; but with the latter they are Right faith, Right cognition, and Right conduct. These mottoes, as we might call them, of the two orders are significant. That of the Buddhists refers to concrete, that of the Jains to abstract things. The former shows that Buddhism was animated by a practical and active spirit, while the latter shows Jainism to have been speculative and unenterprising. The history of the two orders proves this inference. While Buddhism, with its active missionary spirit, spread far and wide beyond the borders of India, and outgrowing the narrow bounds of a mere monastic order developed into popular religions in Ceylon, Burma, Tibet and other lands, Jainism always lived a quiet, unobtrusive life within the borders of India, travelling but little, if at all, beyond them. Again, the term applied collectively to the order both by the Buddhists and Jains was sangha or \"the Order.\" But the Jains qualified it by the addition of the further term catu\u1e63\u0101\u1e45ga or \"four-fold.\" With them the monastic order included four classes of persons: monks, nuns, lay-brothers and lay-sisters. With the Buddhists the order included only two classes: monks and nuns; their lay-adherents stood in no essential or organic connection with them. It is obvious that no order of mendicant monks could possibly maintain its existence without some sort of relation to the surrounding secular community. It must of necessity depend for its sustenance and support on those within that community who, out of reverence for the Order, supported it with their alms. But the two orders observed a very different policy towards their respective lay-adherents. With the Buddhists they had no part and parcel in the monastic organization. They were not formally admitted into communion with the order, they had not to take any vows, there were no rules to regulate their position or conduct, no regular devotional services were held for them, neither was there any formal exclusion of any unworthy lay-person; in fact, the position of the lay-adherent was so loose and informal that a lay-adherent of the Buddhistic order might at the same time be also an adherent of another order; there were no rules prohibiting such an anomalous position. The proud feeling of being a member of Buddha's great order and partaking of its spiritual benefits was not permitted to the Buddhist lay-adherent. Very different was the case of the Jain lay-adherent. His position was exactly the reverse in all the points just enumerated. He formed an integral part of the organisation, and thus was made to feel that his interests were bound up with those of his order. In this matter Buddhism made a fatal mistake; for their treatment of their lay-adherents was one of the main causes of the eventual total disappearance of their order from\nIndia, the land of their home. When in the course of time, in consequence of the change of religious tendencies which already began to operate in the seventh century A.D., at the time of the celebrated Chinese Buddhist pilgrim, Hiuen Tsiang, the recruitment of their order declined; and when, later on, the pressure of the spiritual opposition of the great Brahmanic orders, founded in the ninth century A.D. by \u00c7\u0101\u1e45kar\u0101c\u0101rya and his disciples, increased; and when finally, in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries A.D., the storm of the iconoclastic Muhammadan conquest swept over India, and, as related in the histories of T\u0101r\u0101n\u0101th and Minh\u0101ju-d-d\u012bn, inflicted wholesale massacre on the few still surviving monastic settlements, Buddhism simply collapsed; it utterly disappeared. Having maintained no inseparable bond with the broad strata of the secular life of the people, it had no chance of recruitment, it could neither maintain, nor recover itself. The lay-followers of Buddhism, having lost their monks to whom no paramount interest bound them, by a most natural process relapsed into Brahmanism, in which they again found, as they had done before the advent of Buddhism, not only their priests, but also their spiritual directors. Some small portions only of the former Buddhist laity, here and there, especially in Bengal, preferred to keep aloof, maintaining a caricatured form of Buddhism without Buddha and his Order, in which it is only with great difficulty that one can recognize the distorted traces of the once flourishing system of Buddha. The discovery of these caricatured survivals of Buddhism in Bengal is mainly due to the researches of our Joint-Philological Secretary, Pandit Hara Prasad Shastri, who has unearthed them as it were in the followers of Dharma, one of the well-known units of the Buddhist Trinity, and published an account of them in the Journal of our Society for 1895. From them Dharmtolla Street takes its name, and their Dharma temple still stands in the modern Jaun Bazar Street.\n\nVery different was the fate of Jainism which securely lived through the stormy times that shattered Buddhism. It has maintained itself quietly and unobtrusively to the present day; and its prospering monastic settlements and lay-communities are still to be found in Western and Southern India and Bengal; one of them we have close to our own doors, in the Maniktola suburb of this city. Jainism, indeed, is the only one of the almost primeval monastic orders of India which has survived down to the present day. But the history of an order of such a retiring character can necessarily offer but few points of general interest. There is really only one event in it which in its results obtrudes itself on the notice of the outside world. This is the great schism, which has been already alluded to, into the two divisions\nof the \u0100v\u0101mbaras and Digambaras, the 'White-clothed' and the 'Unclothed' monks. The division took place, as indicated by the name, on the question of wearing clothes, though there are also other differences both in point of doctrine and practice, which, however, are of no general interest. The two divisions maintain an entirely separate and even antagonistic existence; they possess also almost entirely distinct literatures, and the most ancient class of sacred books, the so-called \u0100ngas and P\u016brvas, have been preserved only in the \u0100v\u0101mbara division. Moreover both divisions are now divided into an extensive ramification of schools and lines of teachers, which gradually grew up in the course of centuries. The historical, or rather chronicling, spirit is as strongly developed in the Jains as it is in the Buddhists. They keep up regular P\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101valis or lists of the succession of teachers, several of which have been published by Hofrath Prof. B\u00fchler, Dr. Klatt and myself in the Indian Antiquary and the Epigraphia Indica; and their sacred and other books are throughout interspersed with an abundance of chronicling notices, which have been extracted and recorded, in addition to the scholars already mentioned, by Professors Weber and Bhandarkar.*\n\nFrom all these materials the Jain tradition regarding their Order and their Sacred Books may be gathered. In its main features it is as follows.\n\nIn the second century after Mah\u0101v\u012bra's death (about 310 B.C.) a very severe famine, lasting twelve years, took place in the country of Magadha, the modern Bih\u0101r, beyond which, as yet, the Jain order does not seem to have spread. At that time Candra Gupta, of the Maurya dynasty, was king of the country, and Bhadrab\u0101hu was the head of the still undivided Jain community. Under the pressure of the famine, Bhadrab\u0101hu with a portion of his people emigrated into the Karn\u0101\u1e6da (or Canarese) country in the south of India. Over the other portion that remained in Magadha, Sthulabhadra assumed the headship. Towards the end of the famine, during the absence of Bhadrab\u0101hu, a Council assembled at P\u0101\u1e6daliputra, the modern Patna; and this Council collected the Jain sacred books, consisting of the eleven \u0100ngas and the fourteen P\u016brvas, which latter are collectively called the twelfth \u0100\u1e45ga. The troubles that arose during the period of famine produced also a change in the practice of the Jains. The rule regarding the dress of the monks had been, that they should ordinarily go altogether naked, though the wearing of certain clothes appears to have been allowed to the weaker members of the order. Those monks that remained behind felt con-\n\n* See Prof. Weber's Catalogue of the Jain Manuscripts in Berlin, 1888 and 1892; also Prof. Bhandarkar's Report on the Search for Sanskrit MSS., 1883-84. For a fuller list, see Prof. Jacobi's Introduction to his Translation of Jaina S\u016btras, Part II.\nstrained by the exigencies of the time to abandon the rule of nakedness, and to adopt the \"white\" dress. On the other hand, those who out of religious zeal chose to exile themselves rather than admit a change of the rule of nakedness, made that rule compulsory on all the members of their portion of the order. When on the restitution of peace and plenty, the exiles returned to their country, the divergence of practice, which had in the meantime fully established itself between the two parties, made itself too markedly felt to be overlooked. The returned exiles refused to hold fellowship any longer with the (in their opinion) peccant portion that had remained at home. Thus the foundation was laid of the division between the two sections of the Digambaras or naked ones and \u0100v\u0113t\u0101mbaras or white-clothed ones. As a consequence of this difference, the Digambaras refused to acknowledge the collection of Sacred Books made by the Council of P\u0101\u1e6daliputra; and they, therefore, declare that, for them, the P\u016brvas and A\u1e45gas are lost. The difference, however, did not at once result in a definite schism: to this it does not appear to have come till a few centuries later, when the final separation took place in the year 79 or 82 A.D. On this point both sections are practically unanimous, their dates only differing by three years. At this time the Jain order had already spread far beyond the borders of its narrow home in Bih\u0101r, and ramified into numerous schools and subdivisions, some of which (as we shall presently see) possessed already flourishing settlements in Mathur\u0101. It would seem that this spirit of expansion developed in the order principally in the time of Suha\u015bin\u012b, who was the head of the \u0100v\u0113t\u0101mbara section towards the end of the third century B.C.; for it is just under him that the P\u0101\u1e6d\u0101valis record an extraordinarily large number of divisions and subdivisions. It is certain that about the middle of the second century B.C. the Jain order had spread as far as the Southern part of Orissa; for the Jains are referred to in Kh\u0101rav\u0101la's inscription on the Khandagiri rock, near Cuttack.\n\nIn the course of time the collection of sacred books, or Siddh\u0101nta as it is called by the Jains, which the Council of P\u0101\u1e6daliputra had established, fell more or less into disorder. It even was in danger of becoming extinct, owing to the scarcity of manuscripts. It became, therefore, necessary to reduce it to order, and to fix it in an authorised edition of manuscript \"books.\" This was done at a Council held in Vallabhi in Gujar\u0101t, under the presidency of D\u0113varddhi, the head of one of the principal schools.\n\nIt is clear from this tradition that the collection of the Jain sacred books, as preserved by the \u0100v\u0113t\u0101mbara section of the community, goes back to the end of the fourth or the beginning of the third century\nbefore the Christian era; for the Council of P\u0101\u1e6daliputra which made the collection must have taken place about 300 B.C. The very process of a collection points to the fact of a previous existence; and the tradition of the Jains maintains that the P\u016brvas, one of the two main divisions of the collection, were taught by Mah\u0101v\u012bra himself to his immediate disciples, the so-called Ganadhara\u015b, and the latter composed the \u0100ngas, the other main division. The name P\u016brva means an 'earlier' composition; and the P\u016brvas were evidently called so because they existed prior to the \u0100ngas. At the time of the Council of P\u0101\u1e6daliputra a large portion of them, as the Jains themselves admit, had been already lost; and what still remained was then embodied in a twelfth \u0100yga. The Jain traditions about these P\u016brvas clearly point to the fact that there was once an original set of sacred books, the remains of which were, by the P\u0101\u1e6daliputra Council, re-cast and collected in a new form, better adapted to the changed circumstances of the time.\n\nSuch is the tradition of the Jaina order with respect to its history and its sacred books. Until some thirty years ago, the prevalent disposition was to treat this tradition with great distrust. The presence of the strongly developed and curiously exact chronicling spirit, however, which I have already remarked on, as manifest throughout most of the literature of the Jains, lends but little support to that attitude; and his fact has been increasingly realised through the more intimate acquaintance with Jain literature which has been gained, during the period under review, through the publication of Jain books made by Professors Jacobi, Leumann, myself and others. Professor Jacobi, by a careful examination of the language and style of the Jain sacred books, which showed their very archaic character, contributed not a little to this result. Still so long as no independent and incontrovertible evidence could be brought forward in corroboration of the statements of the Jain tradition, no full conviction of the general reliability of it could be hoped for. The discovery of such independent corroborative evidence is the most striking feature of the period I am reviewing and is entirely due to the acumen of Hofrath Prof. B\u00fchler of Vienna. On making a re-examination of certain inscriptions, found in 1871 by the late Major-General Sir A. Cunningham in the ruins of the Kangkh\u0101li mound in Mathur\u0101, Hofrath B\u00fchler discovered among them some which made mention of several teachers and subdivisions of the Jains. Accordingly he arranged with Dr. J. Burgess, who was at that\n\n5 His researches on this subject are contained in a series of papers published in the volumes of the Vienna Oriental Journal for 1887 to 1891 and 1896, and in the Transactions of the Imperial Academy of Sciences in Vienna for 1897.\n\n6 See his Survey Reports, Vol. II.\ntime at the head of the Archaeological Department, to make a thorough excavation of that mound. The work of excavation was carried out, under the superintendence of Dr. F\u00fchrer, during the working seasons of 1889 to 1893, and again in 1896. An abundant yield of fresh inscriptions was obtained, impressions of all of which were sent to Hofrat B\u00fchler. By him they were carefully examined, and a selection of the most valuable published, with facsimiles, in the Vienna Oriental Journal, as well as in the two first volumes of the Epigraphia Indica.\n\nWhat makes these inscriptions particularly valuable is the fact that many of them are dated in years of the Indo-Scythian era, that is, the era which was used by the Indo-Scythian kings Kanishka, Huvishka and Vasud\u0113va. These kings flourished in the two first centuries of the Christian era, and their empire included North-Western India, as far down as Mathur\u0101. The dates of the inscriptions range from the 5th to 98th year of that era, and are, according to the usually accepted interpretation, equivalent to A.D. 83\u2013176. Accordingly they prove the existence of the Jain order in Mathur\u0101 at an as early a date as the first and second centuries of our era. Most of these inscriptions were found engraved on the pedestals of Jain statues, and recorded the dedication of these statues to some Jain temple by Jain laymen or laywomen under the direction of some Jain monk or nun, whose spiritual pedigree is carefully recorded. These dedications furnish corroborative evidence on many points of great interest.\n\nIn the first place, the divisions and subdivisions of the order to which the directing monk or nun are recorded to have belonged, strikingly agree with those, the existence of which in the first and second centuries of our era are also recorded in the Kalpas\u016btra and other books of the Jains. One of the Ganas or divisions which is most frequently mentioned is the Kaut\u012bka, which was founded by Sushrata, who was at the head of the order in the first half of the second century B.C. Moreover this division belonged to the \u0100v\u0101s\u0101mbara section of the Jains. Thus we have here not only indirect evidence of the existence of the \u0100v\u0101s\u0101mbara Jains in the middle of the second century before Christ, but also direct evidence of the spread of the Kaut\u012bka division, in the first and second centuries A.D., as far as Mathur\u0101, where, to judge from the frequent mention of their name in the inscriptions, they had a numerous and prosperous settlement. At that period there was also a Jain settlement in Bulandshahar, for the inscriptions also mention monks of a subdivision called after Uccanagara, or Var\u0101\u1e47a, both of which anciently were names of that town.\n\nIn the second place, the inscriptions prove the existence of Jain nuns as a regular part of the order; and they also show that these\nnuns were very active in the interest of their faith, especially among the female members of the lay community, since in all cases, except one, laywomen dedicated images at the request of nuns. This fully agrees with the statements of the Jain scriptures. Moreover it affords an additional proof of the very early split of the order into the two sections of the \u0100v\u0113t\u012b\u015b\u0101maras and Digambaras. For the latter do not admit nuns into the order; only the \u0100v\u0113t\u012b\u015b\u0101maras do so. The inscriptions, therefore, prove that the Mathur\u0101 settlement was one of the \u0100v\u0113t\u012b\u015b\u0101mara section, and that the split of the order was already fully established in the first century of our era.\n\nAnother point clearly brought out by the inscriptions is the position of the lay element in the Jain community. I have already remarked that that element formed an integral part of the Jain organization, and shown the very important bearing of this point on the fortunes of the Jain order. The inscriptions apply to the laymen and laywomen the terms \u0100r\u0101vaka and \u0100r\u0101vik\u0101 respectively,\u2014terms which have survived to the present day in the form of Sar\u0101ogi by which the Jain laity are often known. Among the Buddhists the term \u0100r\u0101vaka is also used, but there it signifies an Arhat, that is a monk of a particular degree of sanctity. This circumstance not only marks the position of the lay element within the Jain order, but also brings out clearly an essential difference between the two great orders of Jains and Buddhists.\n\nAgain another point worthy of notice is that the inscriptions often mention the caste of Jain lay-people. I have already remarked how erroneous the idea is that Jainism or Buddhism intended to subvert the caste system. A lay convert to Jainism does not lose his caste by his conversion. He may have to give up the exercise of the trade of his caste, but if he wants a wife for himself or his son, or a husband for his daughter, he can only get them from his old caste. Thus one inscription records a donation by a layman of the loh\u0101r or smith's caste. He cannot have been a smith after his conversion, because Jainism forbids that trade to a layman. The reference, therefore, must be to the caste to which he or his ancestors belonged. It appears, however, from the inscriptions that even then, as in our days, most of the lay people belonged to the mercantile rather than the artificing classes.\n\nI might mention many more points of detail in which the inscriptions discovered in Mathur\u0101 corroborate the statements of the Jain books; but I must refer those who may be interested in the subject, for further information to the papers themselves of Hofrath Prof. B\u00fchler. There is one point, however, which I must not pass over. There is hardly another thing which has hitherto been considered a more characteristic external mark of Buddhism than the well-known Wheel and St\u016bpa\nand their accessories. The late Pandit Bhagwanlal Indraji was the first to point out in 1883, in a paper on the Hathigumpha inscription, read before the Sixth International Congress of Orientalists at Leyden, that the Jains worshipped st\u016bpas. But Hofrath Prof. B\u00fchler's investigations have now fully proved that the hitherto accepted opinion about the Wheel and St\u016bpa must henceforth be relegated to the limbo of popular errors. The remnants of a Jain st\u016bpa have been discovered at Mathur\u0101. Indeed under the influence of the old error, it was at first thought that it must be Buddhist; but when ruins of two Jain temples were found in the closest proximity and all the other numerous evidences of Jainism, such as inscriptions and images of Jain saints, came to light, the true character of the st\u016bpa as a Jain monument could no longer be doubted. This discovery has been confirmed by the discovery of sculptured slabs, on which Jain st\u016bpas with all their accessories are fully represented, closely resembling those hitherto known to us as Buddhist. Hofrath Prof. B\u00fchler has even gone further and shown that the building and worshipping of st\u016bpas was an ancient practice common not only to the Buddhists and Jains, but also to other and even orthodox Brahmanic orders of ascetics. One of the most curious discoveries is an inscribed and sculptured slab, which formed the pedestal of a Jain statue. It shows the representation of a Wheel mounted on a trident, exactly in the same way as seen on Buddhist monuments, and proves that the celebrated Wheel is not a distinctive mark of the Buddhists. The inscription states that the statue was put up by a Jain lay-woman under the advice of her spiritual director, and the portrait-figures of these are sculptured on the slab in the act of worshipping the sacred symbol. The inscription further states that the statue was put up in a year probably corresponding to 157 A.D., at a votive st\u016bpa which was built by the Gods. That phrase \"built by the Gods\" shows that the st\u016bpa must have been an extremely ancient one, since in the second century A.D. its real origin had already been forgotten, and a myth did duty for historical truth. The conclusion is inevitable that the st\u016bpa must have been erected several centuries earlier, and this is confirmed by a tradition which Hofrath Prof. B\u00fchler has discovered in one of the Jain books. According to that tradition, the st\u016bpa was still in existence in the middle of the ninth century A.D., when it underwent repairs, and was encased in stone. Originally it is said to have been built of bricks, and to have enshrined a gold casket dedicated to P\u0101rvan\u0101tha. This gold casket had been brought, as it is said, by the gods to Mathur\u0101, and was for a long time kept exposed to view for the worship of the Jains;\n\n1 Jinaprabha's T\u012brthakalpa; see the Transactions of the Vienna Academy of Sciences, Vol. CXXXVII.\nbut afterwards, when one of the ancient kings of Mathur\u0101 attempted to appropriate it, a brick st\u016bpa was built over it. This probably refers to the second century before Christ, when the Jains settled in Mathur\u0101 and when they may have brought the casket with them from Bih\u0101r: the king might be the Indo-Scythian Kanishka, who reigned about the commencement of our era.\n\nWhile thus the period under review has been one of fundamental importance for our knowledge of the history of Jainism and its founder, it has not been altogether unfruitful with respect to the great rival organisation of Buddhism. The history, indeed, of that order and of its founder has long been well known, yet, curiously enough, until quite recently, none of the localities connected with the most important events in Buddha\u2019s personal history, such as his birth and death, had been identified. There was certainly one good reason for this curious circumstance; for, as it now turns out, those localities are outside our borders, within the territory of Nepal, and therefore have been precluded from the search operations of our archeological surveys.\n\nWith the discoveries in this respect the name of one of the members of our Society, Dr. L. A. Waddell, the learned author of *Buddhism in Tibet*, is prominently connected. The zeal with which he has devoted a portion of his holidays and the opportunities afforded by official tours to the search for long lost Buddhist localities cannot be too highly praised. In 1891 he succeeded, on one of his tours, to discover near the village of Uren, in the district of Mungir, the site of the celebrated Hermitage of Buddha, where that saint is reported by Hiuen Tsiang to have rested for a season during the rains. The full details of this identification have been published by Dr. Waddell in our Journal. Subsequent researches enabled him to discover in the neighbourhood of Patna City what appears to be conclusive evidence of the exact position of the great emperor A\u015boka\u2019s famous capital of P\u0101\u1e6daliputra. The evidence thus furnished, in 1892, is at present being followed up, so far as financial considerations permit, by the Government of Bengal.\n\nThe most important discovery, however, to which his studies of old Buddhist history have led, is that of Buddha\u2019s birth-place in the neighbourhood of a small village called Nigliv\u0101. This is situated, just beyond the British frontiers, within the Nepalese Terai, about 20 miles north of the Chilli\u0101 Police Station in the Basti District. Rumours of the existence near that place of one or more inscribed pillars had been cur-\n\n---\n\n8 See Volume LXI, for 1892.\n9 Published in his pamphlet on the *Discovery of the Exact Site of A\u015boka\u2019s Classical Capital of P\u0101\u1e6daliputra*; 1892.\nrent for many years. Mr. V. A. Smith had heard of one \"a dozen years ago.\" But they took more definite shape in the spring of 1893 when a Nepalese Officer, Major Jashkaran Singh of Balrampur, saw and reported an A\u015boka pillar in the Terai. Through the information thus furnished Dr. F\u00fchrer was enabled in March 1895 to visit the spot, and to find there, on the banks of the Nig\u0101li S\u0101gar, a pillar, with an edict of king A\u015boka inscribed on it. This edict, when deciphered in April 1895 by Hofrat Prof. B\u00fchler, proved that the ruins of a st\u016bpa close by were those of the funeral monument of the mythical Buddha K\u014d\u1e47\u0101gamana. Dr. F\u00fchrer also noticed in the neighbourhood \"vast ruins\" which clearly pointed to the existence there of a large inhabited place in ancient days. A report of these discoveries was published by him in July 1895.\n\nAs soon as Dr. Waddell, who had for some time made Hinen Tsiang's account of Buddha's birth-place a special study, read the newly-found edict, he at once saw the clue which it supplied towards fixing the site of that place in the neighbourhood of the K\u014d\u1e47\u0101gamana st\u016bpa and its pillar. He published his discovery in June 1896, pointing out that, in accordance with the indication given by Hinen Tsiang, Kapilavastu, the birth-place of Buddha, must be within a few miles distance of Nigliv\u0101. Thereupon the Government of India was moved, both by Dr. Waddell and Dr. F\u00fchrer, to obtain the permission of the Nepalese Darbar to explore the site thus indicated, in order to verify its being that of Kapilavastu. That permission having been secured, and Dr. Waddell's services not being available, Dr. F\u00fchrer was deputed to carry out the desired verification. In November 1896 he proceeded to Nigliv\u0101, and finding that the Nepalese Government were not prepared to undertake excavations, he went on, south-eastward, to Bhagw\u0101npur, where he had been told, in the previous year, of the existence of another inscribed pillar. He there found the looked-for pillar on the 1st December 1896, and upon it an inscription which identified the spot upon which it stood as the celebrated Garden of Lumbini in which Buddha is said to have been born. Starting from this spot as a fixed point, Dr. F\u00fchrer next discovered the ruins of Kapilavastu, at a distance of twelve miles north-west of it, and five miles west of Nigliv\u0101. This places Kapilavastu practically at the point indicated for it by Dr. Waddell. It still remains to explore the site of that celebrated town, and to excavate its more prominent ruins. This is a task which, as I learn from Dr. F\u00fchrer, is at present in progress under his superintendence.\n\n10 See the Academy, for 27th April 1895.\n11 In the Englishman of the 1st June 1896.\n12 For further particulars see Dr. F\u00fchrer's Annual Progress Reports for 1893-97; also Journal, Royal Asiatic Society, for 1897, pp. 429, 615, 644.\nWith the discovery of Kapilavastu, it will now be possible also to identify definitely Kusinagara, the place where Buddha died. It is probable that it will be found to the eastward, either just within or just without the frontier-line dividing British and Nepalese territory. To discover this celebrated spot must be the next object of arch\u00e6ological research.\n\nArch\u00e6ology and Epigraphy.\u2014I will now proceed to give you some account of our progress in Indian arch\u00e6ology and epigraphy.\n\nThe earliest specimen of Indian writing known to us is that which is found in the celebrated A\u1e63oka inscriptions. A\u1e63oka reigned in the latter half of the third century B.C. His capital was at P\u0101\u1e6daliputra, the modern Patna, but he ruled over an empire which probably had the widest extension ever attained by any under a native Indian ruler. This is shown by the wide distribution of the edicts which he caused to be engraved on rocks and pillars throughout his dominions, and in which he promulgated his regulations for ordering the moral and religious welfare of his subjects. These edicts have been found as far east as Dhauli in Orissa, as far west as Sh\u0101hbazgah\u012b beyond the Indus, and as far south as Sidd\u0101pur in Mysore. The northern extension of A\u1e63oka\u2019s empire is shown by the recent discovery (in 1895) of a pillar inscription of his in Nigliv\u0101, within the Nepalese frontiers. The Mysore edicts, too, are a recent discovery, having been found by Mr. Lewis Rice in 1892 near the village of Sidd\u0101pur, in the Chitaldurg district in the Mysore State. One of these A\u1e63oka edicts forms a connected series of fourteen paragraphs. It occurs in a nearly identical version engraved on large rocks or boulders at six different places, among them at Girn\u0101r in Junagadh, at Mansehra near Abbottabad, and at Sh\u0101hbazgah\u012b. At these three places, the three last paragraphs of the edict had long been missing; but quite recently, they have been recovered, either wholly or in part. One was discovered by Major H. A. Deane, in 1887, another by a subordinate officer of the Arch\u00e6ological Department in 1889, and the third by Rae Bah\u0101dur Gop\u0101lji S. Desai in 1893.18\n\nUntil recently it had been customary to call the script used in these inscriptions the \u201cA\u1e63oka characters,\u201d because for a long time they had not been observed to occur in any inscriptions but those of A\u1e63oka. Gradually, however, other inscriptions came to light, exhibiting the same characters. They were observed, e.g., on very early coins of Gr\u00e6co-Indian and other dynasties; and they also appear on the sculptures of the Barhaut st\u016bpa which may be seen in one of the galleries.\n\n18 Published by Hofrath Prof. B\u00fchler in the Epigraphia Indica, Vol. I, p. 16, in the Vienna Oriental Journal, Vol. VIII, p. 318, and in the Journal of the German Oriental Society, Vol. XLIV, p. 702.\nof the Indian Museum. Since then they have been found, for example, in an inscription of the Pabhosa cave which was discovered in 1887 by Mr. J. Cockburn of the Opium Department, in another found in the same year by the late Kaviraj Syamal Das near Nagari in Mewar, and in the curious copper-plate, discovered by Dr. Hoey in 1894 at Sohgaunra in the Gorakhpur District. The name \"A\u00e7oka character\" was, therefore, found very misleading and inconvenient. Hence, seeing that A\u00e7oka belonged to the Maurya dynasty, the term \"Maurya characters\" or \"Maurya script\" has now generally been adopted. This Maurya script is the lineal ancestor of the modern Northern Indian scripts, notably of the best known among them, the Nagari or Devanagari. There are few things so interesting in archaeology as the history, with all its concomitant details, of the evolution of the modern scripts of Northern India. But unfortunately, till recently, the absence of a good text-book on the subject was felt to be a great hindrance. A very creditable attempt to supply this want was made by a native scholar Gaurishankar Hirachand Gjha of Udaipur in his Paleography of India, published in 1894. But still more was required, and this has now been supplied by Hofrath Prof. G. B\u00fchler of Vienna, who is facile princeps in all matters appertaining to Indian epigraphy and paleography. His excellent and exhaustive Indian Paleography was published in 1897, and forms a portion of the Encyclopaedia of Indo-Aryan Research, which is being brought out under his general editorship, and which will present a summary of everything that modern research has established in the domains of Indian philology and archaeology. The name Br\u0101hm\u012b has been adopted by him as a general term for all the Northern Indian types of alphabet. A cursory survey of these types will show that their evolution has produced a very marked change in the form of the letters about the middle of the fourth century A.D. The oldest type of the preceding period is represented by the Maurya script of the time of A\u00e7oka. The oldest type of the second great period\u2014that type with which this period commences\u2014is what is known as the \"Gupta characters.\" This script is called so because it is used by the kings of the Gupta dynasty who reigned in the fourth and fifth centuries A.D., first in P\u0101taliputra or Patna and afterwards either in Ko\u00e7\u0101mbi or in Ayodhy\u0101, and whose empire was\n\n14 Published by Mr. Cockburn in our Journal, Vol. LVI, p. 31, by myself in the Proceedings As.

A. Smith, in Journal, Royal Asiatic Society, for 1897, p. 910.\nfor a time almost as extensive as that of A\u1e63oka. The second period may be reckoned to have extended to the end of the twelfth century A.D. From that time the Northern Indian alphabets as they now exist have practically become established. The earlier period, also, seems to me to divide itself similarly into two sub-periods about the commencement of the Christian era. The later sub-period is characterised by the \"Indo-Scythian characters,\" used under the kings of the Indo-Scythian dynasty, in the first and second centuries A.D. Their empire was in North-Western India and reached as far as Mathur\u0101, where the numerous Jain inscriptions written in the Indo-Scythian script, referred to in the preceding part of my address, have been found.\n\nIn this connection I may note a remarkable discovery, made by Dr. W. Hoey in 1896 in Gop\u0101lpur in the Gorakhpur District. It is that of a few bricks of large size (10\u00bd by 4\u00bd inches) inscribed with portions of certain Buddhist sacred books. They were dug out from an underground chamber, and the circumstance of some Indo-Scythian copper coins having been found with them shows that their deposition must be referred to the third century A.D. This is confirmed by the character of the writing which is transitional between the Indo-Scythian and Gupta scripts. With the exception of the legends of the Gupta coins, inscriptions dating from the period between 250 and 400 A.D. were almost altogether lacking. The discovery, therefore, of these bricks now helps to fill up a considerable gap in Indian epigraphy. Moreover it is startling to find the Indian Buddhists using bricks, as the Assyrians did, to preserve long documents. Speaking of Gupta coins I may mention that we now possess an excellent and exhaustive monograph on the subject, published in 1889 and 1892 by Mr. V. A. Smith in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society. Some of the gold coins and medals, issued by the kings of the Gupta dynasty, are among the finest known in Indian Numismatics. With regard to this dynasty a very important discovery was made in 1888 at Bhitari in the Gh\u0101zipur district. This was a large seal of copper and silver, the legend on which in 1889 I succeeded in deciphering, and which proved that the dynasty consisted of nine members instead of the seven hitherto known. The two new members are Pur\u0101 Gupta and Kum\u0101ra Gupta II. The history of two earlier members, Samudra Gupta and Candra Gupta, has been examined in detail in three very interesting papers published by Mr. V. A. Smith in\n\n---\n\n17 Published by Mr. V. A. Smith in our Proceedings for 1896, p. 99.\n18 Also in our own Journal, Vol. LIII, for 1884; see also his papers on \"Numismatic Novelties\" in our Journal, Vols. LXV and LXVI.\n19 Published in a joint-paper by Mr. V. A. Smith and myself in our Journal, Vol. LVIII, for 1889.\nthe Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society for 1897. All inscriptions in the Gupta character, known up to the year 1888, have been collected by Dr. J. F. Fleet and published by him, with facsimiles, in the third volume of the *Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum*, in the introduction to which he has also finally settled the hitherto much disputed epoch of the celebrated Gupta era to be the year 319-20 A.D.\n\nFor long the prevalent opinion has been that the introduction of the art of writing into India took place in the third century B.C., during the rule of the Maurya dynasty. This opinion was based on the fact that the earliest specimens of writing, though incised in places as widely apart as Orissa and Gujar\u00e4t, appeared on the first view to show no local varieties in the shape of their letters. More accurately made facsimiles and a more thorough and minute examination of these facsimiles, such as Hofrath Prof. B\u00fchler and Mr. E. Senart have latterly made and published in the Journals of the German and French Asiatic Societies, have now brought to light the fact that smaller local varieties are by no means absent. The most striking evidence, however, of the existence of a well-marked local variety has been afforded by the inscriptions on the relic-casket, found in 1891 in the Bh\u0101ttiprolu st\u016bpa in the Kistna District of the Madras Presidency. These inscriptions, as Hofrath Prof. B\u00fchler has discovered, show a system of writing which in some respects is radically different from that prevailing in the more Northern inscriptions of A\u1e63oka. Thus, to mention only one point, the Bh\u0101ttiprolu alphabet contains one new letter (?) and five new forms of other letters (gh, j, m, e, s). It is obvious that this discovery throws a new light on the question of the age of the art of writing in India. Such a marked variation cannot have sprung up in a short time, but must have had a long history before the time of A\u1e63oka. With this new light, and with the help of accurate facsimiles now available, Hofrath Prof. B\u00fchler subjected the question of the age and origin of the Br\u0101hm\u012b script to a fresh searching investigation. Their result is to render two facts extremely probable: first that the Br\u0101hm\u012b script is directly derived from the oldest Phenician alphabet, and secondly that it was in common use in\n\n---\n\n20 See Articles I, II and XXIX in that Journal.\n21 The title of this volume is *Inscriptions of the Early Gupta Kings and their Successors*. On the epoch see also Dr. Fleet's paper in the *Journal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society*, Vol. XVIII, for 1891, p. 71.\n22 Published in the *Academy* for May 1892, *Vienna Oriental Journal*, Vol. VI, p. 148, and *Epigraphia Indica*, Vol. II, p. 323.\n23 Published in the *Transactions of the Vienna Imperial Academy of Sciences*, Vol. CXXXII, under the title: *Indian Studies*, No. III, on the \"Origin of the Indian Brahma Alphabet.\" A very useful abstract of Hofrath Prof. B\u00fchler's argument is given by Dr. G. A. Grierson in the *Indian Antiquary*, Vol. XXIV, p. 246.\nIndia during the fifth, and perhaps in the sixth, century B.C. The Br\u0101hmi script, like the English, runs from the left to right, while the Phoenician script, like the Hebrew, used to run from the right to the left. If Hofrath Prof. B\u00fchler's theory is correct, one may expect to find in India some evidence of the change of the direction in writing. Curiously enough such evidence does exist. A coin has been found by the late Major-General Sir A. Cunningham in Eran, in the Central Provinces, which clearly exhibits a legend in Br\u0101hmi characters running from the right to the left. It is probably of about the same age as the A\u015boka edicts, that is, about the third century B.C.; and as these edicts themselves occasionally show single letters placed in that reversed direction, it becomes very probable from these isolated survivals that the great change of the direction in writing the Br\u0101hmi characters took place in India in the course of the fourth century B.C.\n\nI may here mention another discovery made by myself, which corroborates the Indian tendency of changing the direction of writing. By the side of the Br\u0101hmi characters, there was another, quite distinct script in use in India at the time of king A\u015boka. This is the so-called Bactrian or Arim-Pali, or as it is now called the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi script. Its use was limited to North-Western India, from the Panjab westwards, while through the whole of India eastwards and southwards the Br\u0101hmi script, in some one or other of its varieties, was current. Hofrath Prof. B\u00fchler has shown that this secondary Indian script is of somewhat later date than the Br\u0101hmi, that it arose from an Aramean alphabet used in Persia in the sixth century B.C., and that it spread into India only in the fifth, or perhaps even as late as the fourth century B.C. It is a script, which like its source, the Aramean, runs from the right to the left; and it is found written in that fashion in the A\u015boka edicts and all other inscriptions. There is only one exception, namely two coins of the Indo-Parthian king Abdiagases who probably reigned in the first century B.C. in the regions about the Indus. They were obtained by Mr. J. A. Bourdillon from the Gay\u0101 Bazar, and I discovered on them a legend in the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi characters, but running from the left to the right. This shows that a process of change in the direction of writing those characters was beginning to spring up in India in the first century B.C.; and it is not impossible that the change might have, in the course of time, fully established itself within the borders of India, just as it did in the case of the Br\u0101hmi alphabet, but for the circum-\n\n24 Published by him in his Coins of Ancient India, p. 101, Plate XI, fig. 18.\n25 See his paper in the Vienna Oriental Journal, Vol. IX, p. 44.\n26 Published by me in our Proceedings, for May 1895, and in our Journal, Vol. LXVI, Part I, (for 1897), p. 139, Plate VI, figs. 7 and 8.\nstance that the custom of using the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi script died out in India too early to admit of any such radical change. For that script probably ceased to be used in India about the end of the second century A.D., though it continued to be current for a much longer period in the countries bordering on India in the West and North. In those regions its use probably survived until the time of their conquest by the Muhammadan Arabs in the eighth century A.D., when it was superseded by varieties of the Arabic script. On this subject some more evidence has recently come to light. In 1895, Mr. A. Caddy, who had been deputed by the Government of Sir Charles Elliott on archaeological exploration, excavated a large statue of a standing Buddha at the Lorian Tangai stupa, in the lower Swat valley, on the pedestal of which was found a short inscription in the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi characters, dated in the year 318. A similar inscription dated in the year 384 appears on the pedestal of another standing figure of Buddha, discovered in 1883 by Mr. L. White King, at Hashtanagar, in the Peshawar District, and published by Mr. V. A. Smith in our Journal. The era of these two dates is still a matter of dispute, but so much is certain that they carry us well into the fourth or fifth century A.D.\n\nThese dated inscriptions in the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi characters have an important bearing not only on the subject of paleography, but also on the question of the age of Greco-Buddhist art in the countries on the further side of the Indus. Into the latter subject, however, I cannot enter now, both because it is foreign to the matter of epigraphy and paleography which I have now in hand, and because much of it also lies outside the period I am now reviewing. For the existence of a considerable Greek influence on the Indian Buddhist art in the countries bordering on the Indus has long been known. But I will not pass on without calling attention to two masterly essays by Mr. V. A. Smith, on \"Greco-Roman Influence on the Civilization of Ancient India,\" published by him in 1889-92, in the Journal of our Society, and highly praised by Professor Gr\u00fcnwedel of Berlin in his \"Buddhist Art in India.\" Mr. Smith reviews the subject from every point of view, discussing principally the subject of sculpture, but also touching on\n\n---\n\n27 The era may either be that of Kanishka, commencing in 78 A.D., or of Moga commencing about 40 B.C. Accordingly 318 may be equivalent to 396 or 278 A.D., and 384 to 462 or 344 A.D. The latter date has hitherto been read 284, but, as Dr. Bloch informs me, it is undoubtedly 384. See our Journal Vol. LVIII, p. 44; also Indian Antiquary, Vol. VIII, p. 257.\n\n28 See Vols. LVIII and LXI, p. 50, 107ff. Professor Gr\u00fcnwedel's book was published in 1893; see there, p. 79.\narchitecture, painting, coinage, drama, religion, mythology, science and philosophy. I may note, as two of the main results of his review, the conclusions that the Gandh\u0101ra or Peshawar school of sculpture followed the lines of Roman art, and is not the direct descendant of pure Greek art; and that the history of that school was practically at an end by A.D. 450.\n\nAll the specimens of writing which I have hitherto referred to are examples of what is called the lapidary or diplomatic style. It is the style which was peculiar to the clerks of the \"kutcherries\" or offices of the government or other great establishments, and which was used by them for the purpose of engrossing royal edicts, donations, etc. The manuscript copies, prepared by these professional writers, were afterwards reproduced by skilled artisans on stone or copper or other enduring material; and it is in these reproductions that the inscriptions I have referred to have come down to us. In most cases probably the original writing was made by the professional scribe on the permanent material itself. Anyhow, if any were made on perishable material, such as palm-leaf or paper, none have come down to us. The requisite of the diplomatic style of writing is that it should be kalligraphic, that is, clear and legible, and more or less elegant and ornate. In these respects it differs from what is called cursive writing, or that which is used in correspondence and all the ordinary concerns of life. Here the object is not permanence but quickness; the letters are formed with a running hand, they have a tendency to join one another, and to modify their original shape. On the other hand, diplomatic writing has a tendency to conserve older and simpler forms. It represents conservation in the history of the art of writing, while cursive writing represents progress. It follows, therefore, as a general principal in palaeography, that advanced forms of letters mark cursive writing, and that if we meet with a few letters of a cursive form in a document otherwise written in older forms, they have been adopted from the fashions of the cursive writing of the period. Gradually these adoptions grow more extensive; but by the time they include the whole circle of the alphabet, the changes in cursive writing have also advanced a step further. It thus comes to pass that the diplomatic writing of any particular period represents on the whole the state of the cursive writing of the period immediately preceding. These are principles which are now generally admitted in Indian palaeography, but it was Hofrath Prof. B\u00fchler who first directed prominent attention to them.\n\nIt is obvious that cursive writing, as a rule, can only be expected to be met with in manuscripts. No manuscripts, as I have already remarked, have come down to us, dating from the earliest period of\nwriting in India. No manuscript has, as yet, been discovered written in the Maurya characters like those of the time of A\u1e63oka. But that cursive writing did exist in those days is shown by the casual occurrence of advanced forms of letters in the A\u1e63oka inscriptions, and that it cannot have been at all uncommon in the daily concerns of life is shown by numerous references to it in the oldest Indian literature. Thus we hear of a slave getting himself a rich wife by means of a forged letter, and another going to a school to learn writing together with the son of his master, who was a Seth or banker, or again of a teacher corresponding with his pupils. The style of writing used by bankers must have been then, as it is now, of a very cursive kind. All this points to a very early knowledge of the art of writing in India. It may very well go back, as Hofrath Prof. B\u00fchler suggests, to the sixth century before Christ.\n\nThat actual manuscript evidence of such an early age will ever be found is extremely improbable. The commonest writing material in those days were parna or leaves, that is, no doubt, the same kind of palm-leaves as those which are still occasionally used in Orissa and elsewhere. In the climate of India such manuscript materials would not conserve for any considerable length of time. It would have been different, if we had to deal with climatic and meteorologic conditions, such as we have in Egypt or Central Asia. It is not till we come to the commencement of our era that we first meet with manuscripts preserved down to our days. The oldest manuscripts, known until quite recently, were some scraps of inscribed birch-bark, found in 1834 by Mr. Masson in one of the stupas of Afghanistan. These were inscribed with Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi letters, but were too minute to be of any service. However, we possess now a more serviceable manuscript of the same description, and of about the same age. This consists of a few detached leaves of birch-bark, inscribed with Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi characters, and in the P\u0101li language, which appear to have once formed a portion of the Dhammapada, one of the well-known sacred books of the Buddhists. Some of them were obtained in 1891 in Central Asia, by the French-explorer M. Dutreuil de Rhins, who unhappily soon afterwards was murdered at the hands of Tibetans. These leaves ultimately found their way to Paris, while others, secured by Russian explorers, went to St. Petersburg. They had evidently once belonged to the same manuscript. Photographic facsimiles of them were exhibited in 1897 at the Eleventh International Congress of Orientalists in Paris, by Mr. E. Senart.\n\nNumerous other examples will be found in Hofrath Prof. B\u00fchler's essay on the \"Origin of the Br\u0101hm\u012b Alphabet\" above referred to.\n\nIt was one of the Nand\u0101ra Topes; see Ariana Antiqua, p. 84.\nand Professor S. von Oldenburg. In their opinion the manuscript could not be of much later date than the Christian era, and might, possibly, be even older.\n\nIt is thus curious that what is probably the oldest Indian manuscript should have been obtained outside India, in Central Asia. Yet after all, it is perhaps nothing more than might have been expected. Indian civilization and Indian literature was carried by the Buddhist propaganda into Central Asia as early as the commencement of our era. Their settlements extended as far as Khotan, Kuchar and the borders of China proper. What was thus carried out of India stood a very good chance of being preserved by the dry climate and soil of the Central Asian deserts, the wonderfully conserving power of which seems to be as great as that of Egypt. Indeed, to judge from the abundant yields of recent explorations, Central Asia promises to be as fruitful a mine of epigraphical discoveries as Egypt has proved to be. In Central Asia nothing seems to decay but what is destroyed by the ignorance or the malice of men.\n\nIt is to Central Asia that we also owe our oldest manuscript in the Br\u0101hm\u012b alphabet. This is the well-known Bower Manuscript, the date of which cannot be later than 450 A.D., and may be much earlier. My edition of the text of this manuscript, entrusted to me by the Government of India, was completed last year. An introduction, narrating its history and discussing its age, contents, etc., is now under preparation. Its history, which is not without interest on account of its connection with other important discoveries, those of the Weber and Macartney Manuscripts, I will briefly relate. The Bower Manuscript is called after Captain Bower, who, on his tour of Central Asian exploration, in 1890, obtained it in Kuchar from a Turki visitor. The latter also showed him the place where the manuscript had been dug out. It was the site of an ancient Buddhist vih\u0101ra or monastery, partly consisting of cells cut in the rock of a neighbouring hill. In connection with this vih\u0101ra there were also the ruins of an ancient st\u016bpa, from the relic chamber of which the manuscript had been dug out precisely in the same way, as the scraps of inscribed birch-bark and other relics had been obtained by Mr. Masson in 1834 from the old Topes of Afghanistan.\n\nFrom information received by me later on from Mr. Macartney, the British Political Agent in Kashghar, it appears that at some time in 1889 a Turki merchant of Kuchar (probably Captain Bower's visitor), in conjunction with a friend of his named Dild\u0101r Kh\u0101n, an Afghan merchant of Yarkand, undertook, secretly for fear of the Chinese authorities, to excavate the st\u016bpa in question. Their object in digging into\nit was to find treasure, as it was well known that in the time of Yaq\u00fbb Beg much gold had been discovered in such ancient buildings. Probably the Afghan also knew that in his own country the excavation of st\u016bpas had occasionally yielded golden results. Whether or not they found any treasure is not known, but what they do admit to have found was a large number of manuscripts together with a quantity of bones. The hole which they made into the st\u016bpa was excavated straight in, level with the ground, and the manuscripts, accordingly, would seem to have been found in the centre of the st\u016bpa, on the ground level, exactly in the spot where the original deposit of relics is usually met with in such monuments. The two friends divided the spoil between them. The Turki secured as his share the Bower Manuscript, which he afterwards disposed of to Captain Bower in 1890. The Afghan received the other moiety of the manuscripts. Of this he gave, apparently in 1891, one portion to the Russian Consul Petrovski in Kashghar. The latter forwarded it to St. Petersburg where specimens of it were published by Professor von Oldenburg in the Journal of the Imperial Russian Archaeological Society. The remainder Dild\u0101r Kh\u0101n took away with him to Leh in 1891. Here he gave one portion of it to Munshi Ahmad Din, who in his turn presented his acquisition to Mr. Weber, the Moravian Missionary. The latter transmitted it to me, and specimens were published by me in our Journal in 1893. The remaining portion Dild\u0101r Kh\u0101n took with him to India, where he left it with a friend of his in \u2018Alig\u0101r\u1e25. On a subsequent visit to India in 1895, he brought it away again and presented it to Mr. Macartney. The latter forwarded it in 1896 to the Foreign Office in Simla, whence it was transmitted to me, and specimens of it were published by me in our Journal for 1897.\n\nWhen I came to examine more closely the manuscripts received from Mr. Weber and Mr. Macartney in order to compare them with those sent to St. Petersburg, I discovered that between them they contained portions of the same Buddhist work. This work tells the story of a certain General M\u0101nibhadra, how he visited Buddha, became a convert to Buddhism, and was taught by him a wonderfully effective charm. With the two-thirds in my hands, and the one-third in St. Petersburg, it will now probably be possible to publish the entire work, and I would suggest that the British and Russian Governments combine to do so.\n\nThe principle of giving suum cuique is one which it is well to observe on all occasions. Accordingly I have called the manuscripts received by me from Mr. Weber and Mr. Macartney by their names, the Weber Manuscripts and the Macartney Manuscripts. Similarly I\nhave called some other Central Asian manuscripts which I received from Captain H. S. Godfrey, Assistant British Resident in Kashmir, the Godfrey Manuscripts. These two gentlemen, Mr. Macartney and Captain Godfrey deserve the greatest credit for the zeal and circumspection with which they have been collecting not only manuscripts but also other antiquities from that part of Central Asia which is known as Chinese or Eastern Turkistan, and assisting me in making a collection worthy of our country. Their efforts are being ably seconded by Colonel Sir Adalbert Talbot, K.C.I.E., the British Resident in Kashmir.\n\nCentral Asian archaeological exploration is being more and more vigorously conducted every year. France and Russia have been in the field for some years. They have latterly been joined by Sweden, whose energetic explorer Dr. Sven Hedin has returned from a prolonged tour in Eastern Turkistan with a large collection of antiquities. Feeling that it would not do for Great Britain to be outstripped in these researches, I suggested to the Government of India the desirability of instructing their Political Agents in Kashghar and elsewhere to endeavour to collect Central Asian antiquities. This was in 1893, while I was working at my edition of the Bower Manuscript. My suggestion was heartily seconded by Sir Charles Lyall, K.C.S.I. (then the Home Secretary), and the Government of India, approving it, issued necessary instructions in August 1893. Since then a large number of such antiquities has been secured, and more are coming in. All acquisitions are transmitted to me, under the orders of the Government of India, for examination and report; their final place of deposit is to be the British Museum in London.\n\nThese antiquities consist of terracottas, coins, images and miscellaneous objects of metal, stone or other material; but the main portion is formed of manuscripts. A regular, or perhaps I should rather say an irregular, trade in such antiquities seems now to have sprung up. Captain Younghusband, in the interesting account of his travels through The Heart of a Continent, tells us how he advised one of his Musalm\u00e1n guides, whose great ambition was to visit England, to \"search about among the old ruined cities of that country and those buried in sand, in order to find old ornaments and books for which large sums of money would be given him in England.\" Eastern Turkistan which is now to a great extent an arid desert of sand, seems to have been a fairly fertile country about the commencement of our era. Two great trade routes passed through it from China to Western Asia. One skirted the foot of the Tian-Shan mountains, along its northern borders, running by the town of Kuch\u00eb or Kuchar; the other passed by the Kuen-lun mountains and the town of Khotan on the south. It is principally from these two towns and the intervening desert coun-\ntry that the antiquities we now possess have been procured. Some were obtained in Kuchar, but most of them came from the Takla Makan Desert, lying north of Khotan. That desert is, by the natives of Kashgharia, believed to have been once a fertile and cultivated country. There is a tradition that before the introduction of Muhammedanism, in the eleventh century A.D., forty-one cities flourished in that region, but that by reason of the obstinate disbelief of the inhabitants, who were mostly idolaters, their country was suddenly and miraculously destroyed by a sandstorm. It is certain that the town of Katak, which probably lay about midway between Kuchar and Khotan, was buried and destroyed by the sands about 1330 A.D. But this process of submersion under the \"moving sands\" as they are fitly called by the natives, has been going on for centuries, as we know from the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Huen Tsiang who travelled through Eastern Turkistan in the middle of the seventh century. Very graphic accounts of the appearance and action of the moving sands are given by Dr. Bellew, Captain Younghusband and other travellers. \"During the spring and summer months a north or north-west wind prevails. It blows with considerable force and persistence for many days consecutively. As it sweeps over the plain, it raises the impalpable dust on its surface, and obscures the air by a dense haze resembling in darkness a November fog in London, but it drives the heavier particles of sand before it, and on the subsidence of the wind they are left on the plain in the form of ripples like those on the sandy beach washed by an ebbing current.\" In course of time there is formed \"a perfect sea of loose sand advancing in regular wave lines from north-west to south-east. The sand dunes are mostly from ten to twenty feet high, but some are seen like little hills, full a hundred feet high, and in some spots higher. They cover the plain, of which the hard clay is seen between their rows, with numberless chains of two or three or more together in a line, and follow in successive rows one behind the other.\" It is these moving sands that have engulfed whatever of the ancient civilization of Eastern Turkistan escaped the devastations of consecutive wars and conquests.\n\nThat civilization must have been of a very mixed kind; for Eastern Turkistan was the meeting place of the culture of India, China and Western Asia, Indian civilization was carried there by the early Buddhist propaganda about the commencement of our era. Somewhat later the semi-Greek culture of Parthia and Armenia and the indigenous civilization of China were brought into the country by the merchants and soldiers that travelled or marched by the two great trade-routes already referred to. These were followed still later, from\nthe sixth to the eighth centuries, by the civilization of the Nestorian Christian Missionaries, and finally, from the ninth century, by the Arab Muhammadan conquests.\n\nIt can be easily imagined that such a mixture of civilization would betray evidences of its existence in the antiquities recovered from the sand-buried tracts and towns of the country. Such is really the case. The antique objects which have now accumulated with me, owing principally, as I have already remarked, to the exertions of Mr. Macartney and Captain Godfrey, divide themselves into four classes: manuscripts, coins, terra-cottas, and miscellaneous objects. Some of the manuscripts have been dug out from old Buddhist ruins near Kuchar, and belong to the most ancient portion of the collection. But all the rest have come from the neighbourhood of Khotan, where, as Mr. Macartney informs me, \"these relics are in such abundance that a few persons of that town make a regular livelihood as treasure-seekers. After a sandstorm or a flood they will proceed to such sand-buried localities as seem most promising in the hope of picking up some objects in gold or silver which had been laid bare by the wind or water.\"\n\nThe manuscripts obtained from Kuchar are the Bower MS., the Weber MSS., and a few of the Macartney MSS. The peculiarity of these is that they are all written in two species of the Indian Br\u0101hm\u012b alphabet. One of these is a species which was actually current in North-Western India up to the sixth century A.D. And it follows, therefore, that the manuscripts written in this variety of the Br\u0101hm\u012b,\u2014commonly known, in a general way, as the Gupta characters\u2014were either imported from India or written by Indian Buddhists who had settled in Kuchar. It follows further that these manuscripts cannot well be later than the sixth century, though they may be much older. In fact, the Bower MS. probably belongs to the fifth century, and one of the Macartney MSS. which has a still more archaic appearance, to the fourth century A.D. The interest of these manuscripts, apart from their great palaeographic value, principally lies in two points: the direct evidence which they afford of the early existence of Indian Buddhism in Kuchar, and the light which they throw on the history of Indian Medicine. They mainly contain medical treatises, and thus not only prove the very early existence, hitherto much doubted, of the science of medicine in India, but also that the profession of medicine, in those early days, was inseparable from that of sorcery and astrology, and that, in fact the monkish owner of the manuscripts was a \"medicine-man\" rather than a \"medical man.\"\n\nThe Bower Manuscript is written on leaves of birch-bark, while all the other Central Asian manuscripts are written on paper of varying\ntexture and colour. Paper appears to have been the usual writing material in Eastern Turkistan. The art of paper making has been known for ages in China; it has also been practised for a long time in the Himalayan countries. It cannot, therefore, be a surprise to find that it was also known in Eastern Turkistan, which from almost the beginning of our era has been in more or less close political connection with China. The birch, on the other hand, is not known in Eastern Turkistan, while it is found in the Himalayas, and its bark is used as common writing material in Kashmir. This is an additional proof of the Bower Manuscript being an Indian product, exported to Central Asia.\n\nMost of the Macartney Manuscripts, as I have already remarked, come from the neighbourhood of Khotan. They were found or dug out at different places in the Takla Makan desert, generally about 50 or 60 miles distant from that town. The find-spots are sometimes described as ruins of walls of habitations, sometimes as cemeteries. One is described as a solitary mound, and circular, about 5 feet in diameter and 2 feet in height. This was evidently the ruin of an old sepulchral tumulus or stupa; for in it was found a skull resting on a coarse cloth bag enclosing a manuscript book; and two small copper images of horsemen were dug up from its interior. The whole of this find was received by me exactly in the state in which it had been found.\n\nThe manuscripts from Khotan form a surprisingly varied collection, both with regard to condition and script. As to their condition, there are among them bound volumes, detached leaves, and large single sheets. The single sheets appear to have been official documents of some kind; for they mostly bear the inked impress of seals. Many of the detached leaves appear to have originally belonged to a volume, now broken up, whether by the finder or by some other cause, is not known. Of bound volumes I now have twenty-one in my possession. They greatly vary both in shape, size and thickness. Some are nearly square, others decidedly oblong. Some are about eleven, others only about four inches square; some measure $15 \\times 4\\frac{1}{2}$, others only $10 \\times 7 \\times 4\\frac{1}{2}$ inches. The number of their leaves varies between 12 and 112. Some are bound, or rather stitched, in the modern European fashion; others are done up like Indian p\u00f4this by means of a string-hole and wooden boards, only instead of a string, a copper nail is passed through the hole. The stitching likewise is done either by means of two or three copper nails, or by twists of paper. The ink which is used is, as a rule, black; only in two or three exceptional cases, it is white; but in either case it is indelible; for all the manuscripts can be washed, without injuring the writing.\nWith reference to the characters and the language in which these manuscripts are written I am not yet in a position to make any definite statement, as I have had no leisure to make more than a very cursory examination of them. There certainly seem to be at least seven distinct scripts, and from sixteen to twenty varieties. The scripts are all of old types and appear to be Armenian, Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi, Pahlavi, Turki, Uigar (or Nestorian), Chinese, and two others as yet quite unassignable. Of course, a script is not any necessary indication of the language in which the book may be written; and so long as the scripts have not been definitely deciphered, it is not possible to determine the number of languages that may be represented in the manuscripts. I may note, however, that in one instance, the manuscript (one of the sealed documents) shows two scripts side by side, a circumstance which may possibly afford a key to the decipherment. Similar help may perhaps be given by another manuscript (one of the Turki) which seems to contain sketches of seals or coins.\n\nBesides manuscripts, my collection of Central Asian antiquities contains, as I have already stated, a large number of coins (about 300). These, it may be hoped, will prove of great value for the purpose of determining the age of the sand-buried cities. They extend over a considerable space of time, though they are all very old. Some are Chinese, and go back to about the first century B.C.; others are Sassanian of the fourth and fifth centuries A.D. Others again belong to some of the earlier Muhammadan dynasties. Among the earliest coins there are a few of very peculiar interest, because they are bilingual, showing Chinese legends on one side and Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi on the other. The Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi legend, according to Dr. Bloch who has kindly examined them for me, appears to refer these coins to Gondophares in the first century A.D.\n\nAmong the terra-cottas in my collection, there are a number of pieces of pottery which show Gr\u00e6co-Buddhist designs of that kind which was current in Gandh\u0101ra, a portion of modern Afghanistan, in the earliest centuries of our era. Mr. Havell, the Principal of the Calcutta School of Art, has been very helpful to me in re-constructing some very fine vases of this kind from a few detached fragments. There are also numerous full figures of monkeys, from 1 to 3 inches high, in all sorts of postures, rather well made, some playing on the well-known Greek reed instrument, the syrinx, like satyrs. Very curious is one piece which shows an ornamental design peculiar to Assyria. Another piece bears a lightly incised inscription in ancient Br\u0101hm\u012b characters of the fifth century A.D. All this points to an extension, in those early ages, of the Grecian culture of Western Asia into Eastern Turkistan,\u2014a fact which was until now quite unsuspected.\nAltogether Central Asia seems to be a country likely to be pregnant with archeological surprises, and it is satisfactory to know that Great Britain will not be behind other countries in securing a fair share of them.\n\nIn connection with the Central Asian manuscripts of which I have been speaking, I must mention a very important discovery which has been recently made by Major H. A. Deane. In 1894 he first discovered a number of inscriptions in an unknown script, incised more or less carefully and distinctly on detached pieces of stone. In the following years he collected further large numbers of inscriptions of the same kind. They have all been found on the northern border of the Peshawar District and in the independent territory beyond it, in the countries, therefore, which anciently were called Gandh\u0101ra and Udy\u0101na. Some of them have been published by Mr. E. Senart in the Journal of the French Asiatic Society, and the rest by Dr. A. Stein, in our Journal. These two scholars have subjected them to a very careful and minute examination, the result of which is that the characters used in them, though probably closely related to one another, show distinct signs of being distributable into five different varieties. But neither of those scholars, nor indeed anyone else hitherto, has been able to discover a key to reading them. There is, however, some ground for believing that ultimately they will be found to be written in some species of Turki script and language. For some Turki inscriptions found on the banks of the river Orkhon in Mongolia and deciphered by Professor V. Thompson in 1893, have been compared by Hofrath Prof. B\u00fchler with Major Deane's inscriptions, and he has observed that more than a dozen letters seem to be common to both. Further Professors Levi and Chavannes of Paris have shown from the Itinerary of the Chinese pilgrim Oukong that in the middle of the eighth century A.D. the countries of Gandh\u0101ra and Udy\u0101na were united under a dynasty of Turkish nationality and language.\n\nAmong my Central Asian manuscripts there are several which I suspect may be written in a very early species of Turki. The characters are of an unknown kind, but, as the result however of a mere cursory inspection, I seem to have noticed resemblances to the characters occurring in Major Deane's inscriptions. Here, therefore, there seems to present itself a possibility of unravelling the puzzle of the inscriptions as well as the manuscripts.\n\nSee Journal Asiatique, Vol. IV, pp. 332 and 504. Also reprinted as Notes d'Epigraphie Indienne, No. V, 1896; and our Journal, Vol. LXVII, 1898.\n\nThree of them, identified by Mr. Senart, have been called by him the Spankharra, Boner and Mahaban varieties. The other two have been discovered by Dr. Stein who gives the name Nurizui to the fourth variety; the fifth he does not name.\n\nSee Journal Asiatique, Vol. VI, p. 378, for 1895.\nEthnographic and Linguistic Surveys.\u2014During the period under review two new Surveys have been added to those already existing in India and doing such splendid scientific work.\n\nThe first of these is the Ethnographic Survey, which, so far as Bengal is concerned, was under the direction of the Hon'ble H. H. Risley, C.I.E. This survey is one of the direct results of the general census of 1881. It was not commenced, however, before 1885, in Bengal, and it was completed there in 1891 with the publication of Mr. Risley's report in four volumes. In the North-Western Provinces it was taken up in 1892 under the superintendence of Mr. W. Crook, and was completed in 1896, also with the publication of a Report in four volumes. The survey of the Punjab was started in 1894 under the charge of Mr. Longworth Dames, and is still in progress.\n\nThe scheme of these ethnographic enquiries was framed from the first so as to serve two distinct purposes, the one in the main administrative, the other principally scientific,\u2014a distinction which is carefully maintained in the four volumes embodying the results of Mr. Risley's portion of the work. The administrative uses are subserved by his first two volumes which contain, in alphabetical order, in the form of a glossary, an enumeration and description of the tribes, castes, sects and occupations of the people of Bengal. The other two volumes give the scientific part of the enquiry, and consist of the tables of anthropometric data on which Mr. Risley's ethnographic generalisations are based. Special interest attaches to these tables; for they are the first attempt on a large scale to apply the anthropometric system, elaborated by the French school of anthropologists, to the elucidation of the problem of caste which is so prominent in India. In the introduction to his first volume Mr. Risley discusses this problem in the light which is thrown on them by the data collected in the tables. His conclusions may be thus summarised. The whole of India is inhabited by a dolichocephalic or long-headed race. The brachycephalic or broad-headed race occurs only along the northern and eastern borders of Bengal, and can hardly be deemed Indian at all. In the long-headed race, however, two extreme forms can be distinguished, the Aryan and the Dravidian; and between these two extreme forms there are a large number of intermediate groups, each of which forms, for matrimonial purposes, a sharply defined circle, commonly known as a caste, beyond which none of its members can pass. If these groups are arranged in the order of their average nasal index, or the formula indicating the proportion of the length of the nose to its breadth, so that the caste with the finest nose shall be at the top, and that with the coarsest at the bottom of the list, it is found that this order substantially corresponds\nwith the accepted order of social precedence. Mr. Risley, accordingly, bases the origin of caste entirely on distinctions of race. His theory is directly opposed to that of Mr. Nesfield, Ibbetson and others, who hold that caste originated from differences in the occupations of the people. There is a third theory, the traditional one, according to which caste is derived from an original fourfold division of the population into Brahmans, Kshatriyas, Vaigyas and Sudras. These three theories have been reviewed by Mr. E. Senart in 1896 in a little work on *The Castes in India*. He shows that none of these theories is capable of accounting for all the facts connected with caste. The essence of the latter lies in restrictions with regard to connubium and commensality. Such restrictions, however, are by no means confined to India, nor even to Aryan races. They are known to have existed among Greeks, Germans, Russians and other Aryan peoples; and it is probable that they also existed among the races that preceded the Aryan immigration into India. It is in them that we must look for the key to the origin of caste in India. Differences of occupation, race and religion contributed to the now existing divisions of caste, but the spirit and to a large degree the actual details of caste restrictions are identical with the ancient, world-wide, and especially Aryan, customs of restricting connubium and commensality. The abatement and final removal of these restrictions among the Aryan nations of the West is due, as Mr. Senart shows, to the growth of strong political and national feelings; and it is the absence of such feelings in India which probably accounts not only for the continued existence, but occasional new creations of caste in this country.\n\nA survey of Assam, more with reference to its early history and languages, than to ethnology, was initiated by Sir Charles Lyall, K.C.S.I., in 1894, under the energetic direction of Mr. E. A. Gait, who in the previous year had published in the Journal of our Society an account of the Koch dynasty, which formerly ruled in Western Assam and the adjacent districts of Bengal. The immediate object was to make a search for originals or copies of the numerous manuscript *bura\u00f1jis* or histories which were believed to be in existence; but incidentally copper-plate inscriptions, coins, and other old records were also brought to light. Several very important copper-plate grants, found in Gahati, Nowgong, and Barg\u0101on, were made over to me by Mr. Gait to be deciphered. They have been published by me in our Journal, and help to clear up to some extent the obscure history of Assam in the earlier middle ages. They show that there were three dynasties, probably succeeding one another,\n\n---\n\nSee a Review in the *Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society* for 1897, p. 192.\n\nSee volumes LXVI and LXVII, for 1896 and 1897.\nin the tenth and eleventh centuries A.D. The first two of these dynasties appear to have belonged to foreign invaders, and to have included, between them, twenty-two kings. One of the grants (of Nowgong) was issued by Balavarman, one of the members of the second foreign dynasty. The third dynasty was an indigenous one and bore the surname of P\u0101la. Two of its members, Ratnap\u0101la and Indrap\u0101la, the second and fourth of the series, are represented by the Burgaon and Gauhaji grants.\n\nThe modern history of the Assam valley dates from the advent of the Ahoms, a Shan tribe who crossed the Patkoi and invaded Eastern Assam about the beginning of the thirteenth century, and who gradually extended their sway westwards over the whole of the Assam valley, which they continued to rule up to the time of the British occupation. It was the practice of the leading families and of the deodhais or priests to maintain bura\u00f1jis or histories, which were handed down from father to son and were periodically brought up to date. Many of these records were destroyed by order of one of the R\u0101jas who discovered that they contained adverse criticisms of his rule, and others were lost in the troubles which followed the incursion of the Burmese at the beginning of the present century. A considerable number, however, escaped. Some of these were examined by an Assamese gentleman, named Kacinath Tamuli Phukan, who compiled from them a vernacular history of Ahom rule which was published at Sibsagar in 1814. The present enquiries have resulted in the discovery of a number of manuscripts in the possession of the representatives of old families and of some of the tribal deodhais or priests, which add very considerably to the information recorded by Kacinath. These bura\u00f1jis are inscribed on oblong strips of bark of the tree Aquilaria Agallocha. Those that belonged to old families were in the Assamese language, and were translated without difficulty. But those belonging to the deodhais were in the old Ahom language and character, the knowledge of which has almost died out and is now confined to a small number of elderly deodhais. In order to obtain a translation of the latter a young Assamese was appointed to learn the language from the few deodhais who can still speak it, and then with their aid to translate their bura\u00f1jis. This work has now nearly been completed, and when it has been brought to a close, the materials will be utilised for the compilation of a complete history of Ahom rule.\n\nA search has also been made for inscriptions of the Ahom kings on temples, cannon and copper-plates, and for coins issued from their mints.\n\n---\n\n26 For a description of the method of preparing the bark, see Mr. Gait's paper entitled \"An abstract of the contents of one of the Ahom pathis\" published in our Journal, Vol. LXIII, Pt. I, p. 108.\nIn all 28 temple inscriptions, 6 inscriptions on cannon, 48 copper-plates and 69 coins have been found and examined, the earliest of which dates from 1544 A.D. The information obtained from these sources has been utilised for checking the information recorded by K\u0101\u015bin\u0101th; and so far as they go, the result has been to confirm the accuracy of his chronology in a remarkable degree. The majority of the coins collected were in the Sanskrit language and N\u0101gari character, but some of them were in the Ahom language and character. These latter, which have long been a puzzle to numismatists, were deciphered by the Ahom translator, and the readings were published by Mr. Gait, in 1895, in our Journal, together with information on the Ahom system of chronology. In the same volume of our Journal, Mr. Gait also gave some account of the coinage of the Koch kings.\n\nPrevious to these enquiries, very little was known of the history of the Rajas of Jaintia who ruled over the Jaintia Hills and the portion of the Sylhet district which lies to the North of the Surma river. Some traditions regarding these kings have been collected, and ten coins and five copper plates have been found, which prove the accuracy of a traditional list of twenty kings, so far as the last fourteen names in it are concerned, and furnish materials for forming a fairly accurate estimate of the dates when they ruled. The results arrived at were published by Mr. Gait in 1895 in our Journal.\n\nThe state chronicles of the kings of Manipur have been translated under the order of Colonel H. St. P. Maxwell, C.S.I., the Political Agent and Superintendent of the State. The chronicles professedly commence with the birth of the first king of Manipur in 334 A.D., but cannot be relied on for a narrative of actual fact until the early part of the fifteenth century.\n\nIn addition to the above, a number of manuscripts containing traditions of old rulers, legends and mythology, have been collected and translated, and a list has been prepared of all known books and papers bearing on the history, ethnology, &c., of the Assam Province.\n\nSince the publication in 1880 of my Comparative Grammar of the Gaudian Languages, no material progress has been made in our general knowledge of the Sanskritic languages of Northern India. In some points of detail, however, there has been a considerable advance, and this has been almost wholly due to the researches of my colleague in these studies, Dr. G. A. Grierson, C.I.E. They principally concern the\n\n---\n\n87 See our Journal, Vol. LXIV, pp. 237 and 286.\n88 See Vol. LXIV, p. 242.\n89 The account of the Assam Survey is based on a note kindly supplied by Mr. Gait.\ngrammars of the K\u0101\u1e63m\u012br\u012b language and of the dialects of Bih\u0101r and the Panj\u0101b, and are too technical to be of general interest. Those whom it may interest, I must refer to Dr. Grierson's learned essays published in our Journal.\n\nWe may, however, now look forward to a great advance over the whole field of the North-Indian vernaculars, as the result of the Linguistic Survey which is at present proceeding under the direction of Dr. G. A. Grierson. That scholar first mooted the idea of such a survey before the International Congress of Orientalists held in Vienna in 1886. As a result a vote was passed by the Congress urging on the Government of India the importance of preparing a detailed survey of the languages and dialects spoken in this country. The suggestion was favourably entertained by the Government of India, but, owing to various causes, it could not be given effect to for some years, and then only in a modified form. The scheme which was ultimately approved of, and which since 1895 is in operation, comprises the following points. First of all, a rough unscientific catalogue is being made of every known language spoken throughout India, excluding Burmah and the Madras Presidency. The examination of the languages spoken in these two provinces is left to a future opportunity. The area to be investigated, therefore, consists of the Panj\u0101b, the North-West Provinces and Oudh, the Lower Provinces of Bengal and Assam, the Presidency of Bombay, the Central Provinces, and R\u0101jp\u016bt\u0101n\u0101. Attempts will also be made to investigate, as far as possible, the languages of Kashmir and the Himalayan States along the North of Hindustan. This large area includes practically the whole of the Aryan-speaking population of India, besides the languages of hundreds of aboriginal tribes speaking Mund\u0101 and Tibeto-Burman languages. These rough lists are compiled from returns supplied by local officers. Each District Official and, in the case of Independent States, each Political Officer was given a printed form which he was requested to fill up, naming every dialect and form of language, under the appellation by which it is locally known, spoken in the tract under his charge. All these forms have already been received back from the local officers, and the Rough List is in active course of preparation.\n\n40 See his Essays On Bih\u0101r\u012b declension, Vol. LII, 1883; Grammar of Chattisgarhi, Vol. LIX, 1890; Specimen and Analysis of Padm\u0101vati, Vol. LXII, 1893; Pronominal suffixes in K\u0101\u1e63m\u012br\u012b, and Radical and Participial Tenses of the Modern Indo-Aryan Languages, Vol. LXIV, 1896; Irregular Causal Verbs ibidem, K\u0101\u1e63m\u012br\u012b Vowels System, and a List of K\u0101\u1e63m\u012br\u012b Verbs, Vol. LXV, 1896; K\u0101\u1e63m\u012br\u012b Consonantal System, Vol. LXVI, 1897. See also his Seven Grammars of the Bih\u0101r\u012b Language published in 1883\u20131887, and the Rev. T. Bomford's essays on Western P\u0101\u00f1j\u0101b\u012b in Vols. LXIV and LXVI of our Journal.\nThe lists for the Lower Provinces of Bengal, comprising Bengal Proper, Bihar and Orissa, for the Central and North-West Provinces and Oudh and for the Panjab are complete and in the Press, while those for Rajputana and Assam are nearly ready, but have not yet been sent to Press.\n\nDr. Grierson has been good enough to permit me to inspect advanced proofs of those portions which are in the Press. I am thus in a position to explain the composition of the two parts of the Rough List. In the first part, languages are arranged according to local areas. Each local area, or district, is taken in order, and each language spoken in it, together with the estimated number of speakers, is stated, family by family, as it occurs. Languages, indigenous to the district and those spoken in it by non-domiciled immigrants, are distinguished by a difference in the printed type. The second part is like a reversing dictionary. Here languages are arranged according to families and groups, and under each dialect is recorded the name of each local area in which it is spoken. Here too a difference in the arrangement indicates the localities of the dialects spoken by the settled and the immigrant populations.\n\nThese lists are being prepared with as great regard for accuracy as is possible, but they have the defects of their origin. The original returns have been prepared by persons with local knowledge, but who do not pretend to be philologists. They may be taken as representing what intelligent local people consider to be the languages of their own neighbourhood. They give names, but they are names only. We are told, for example, that Bangali is spoken in such and such a place, but we are not told what is meant by the word \"Bangali.\" It is probably the language which Europeans call Bengali, but it may be something else. In the Central Provinces many thousands of Gonds have abandoned their ancestral language, and now speak a barbarous Hindi. In many cases this has been returned by local officers as Gondi, and it will be necessary, therefore, to test every entry regarding that language, in order to see whether the language referred to belongs to the Dravidian or to the Aryan family of speech.\n\nThe decision of these and similar questions is one for linguistic experts, and it is to provide experts with materials for coming to a decision, and thus to render the survey complete and of scientific value, that the second portion of the scheme has been devised and, it is hoped, will be approved of by the Government of India. As soon as the rough list of a Province is complete, translations into every language, indigenous to each district, will be called for from each local officer. One standard passage has been selected for these translations, namely the\nParable of the Prodigal Son. As these translations will in many cases be made by persons who do not know English, a collection of some sixty-five specimen translations of the parable into various Indian languages has been prepared. It is probable that the person selected to translate in each case will be acquainted with at least one of the languages of which a specimen is given. But as every translation will probably be more or less stiff, efforts will be made to procure at the same time an original folktale, song, or other naturally spoken sample of the language. When all these translations have been collected, they will have to be examined, and with their aid each language mentioned in the rough lists will have to be classified under its proper name and family. It is to be hoped that these translations, or at least selected specimens of them, may be published; for if properly edited, they will form a valuable collection of evidence as to the actual linguistic condition of India. When once the rough lists have been corrected and the translations published, we shall for the first time be able to say what languages are spoken in Northern India, and how many people speak in each. We shall also, incidentally, acquire a complete collection of specimens of all the written characters used in that country.\n\nIt is obvious that the second part of the survey which is yet to be made is the far more important of the two. In fact, the first part, by itself, with all its unverified statements, has no practical value, certainly none of any scientific character. Its value lies solely in the fact of its furnishing the basis for the scientific survey. It is, therefore, much to be hoped that nothing may occur to stop the survey at the stage which it has now reached, but that the Government of India may place Dr. Grierson in such a position as will enable him now to devote his whole time to the prosecution of the remaining scientific part of the survey, for which he is exceptionally well fitted, and thus to bring to a successful end the great undertaking which he has initiated, and which will reflect so much credit on the Government of India.\n\nIt must be remembered that such a linguistic survey, in addition to its own proper purpose, is most valuable on account of the fresh light it throws on unsettled points of history and ethnography. Thus there is the tribe of Abhirs or Ahirs, well-known in ancient Indian history. Its identity and habitat has always been a very vexed question. The linguistic survey, at last, has supplied the answer. It has brought to light the Ahirv\u0101\u1e6di or Ahirv\u0101\u1e37i, a dialect of Western Hindi, which is spoken in the district of Gurg\u0101on and the neighbouring native states by as many as 300,000 people, a large number of whom are still Ahirs. These Ahirs of Gurg\u0101on are an important tribe, from whom anciently their country took the Sanskrit name of Abhiravartta;\nand this, in its turn, in a corrupted form, has given its name to their dialect of Ahirv\u0101li. I may give another instance. The last census gives only 4,500 K\u00f6ches in Bengal. The K\u00f6ches are a strong Tibeto-Burman race, which certainly once occupied a large portion of Bengal proper. Now the linguistic survey has discovered 217,500 more of these K\u00f6ches who live in the North-Central Districts of R\u0101jsh\u0101hi, Purnea and Malda. This illustrates how important it is to go on with the survey, and not to stop it in its present half-finished condition.\n\nI have already remarked that we may fully expect the results of the Linguistic Survey to lead to great advances of our knowledge of the history, the inter-relation, and distribution of the languages of Northern India. In order to show what we may expect in this direction, I cannot do better than communicate to you the substance of a note which Dr. Grierson has been good enough to place in my hands.\n\nThe extensive studies which I made of the North Indian vernaculars, when I was preparing my Comparative Grammar of the Gaudian Languages, had led me to the conclusion set out in the Introduction to that Grammar, that there must have been two consecutive Aryan invasions of India, and that the second set of invaders entered the domains of the first \"like a wedge.\" Dr. Grierson informs me that all his studies, subsequent to that publication, have confirmed, in a most striking way, my theory, which even then was not an altogether new suggestion. He is of opinion that it will ultimately be shown that there are much plainer signs of this double invasion in ancient Indian Literature, than has hitherto been supposed. Thus he believes it can be shown that the war between Vi\u00e7v\u0101mitra and Va\u00e7\u012b\u1e63\u1e6dha was a war between these two tribes, in which Va\u00e7\u012b\u1e63\u1e6dha represents the first comers, and Vi\u00e7v\u0101mitra represents their new-come rivals, who had settled on the Sarasvat\u012b, and had already driven the older tribe, partly to the East to beyond the Gandak and into Magadha, partly South into the Pa\u00f1c\u0101la country, and partly West to the banks of the Indus, where Sud\u0101\u015b, Va\u00e7\u012b\u1e63\u1e6dha's master, lived. He further believes that the Kuru-Pa\u00f1c\u0101la war of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata was in its essence a struggle between these two tribes, the Kurus representing the new-comers and the Pa\u00f1c\u0101las the old ones; and that if this theory is borne in mind in reading the Va\u00e7\u012b\u1e63\u1e6dha-Vi\u00e7v\u0101mitra hymns of the Rg-veda and the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, and if a proper study is made of the geography of the period and of the tribes mentioned and the sides they took, it will receive remarkable confirmation.\n\nMr. V. A. Smith, in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society for 1897, p. 891, following Sir A. Cunningham, places the Ahirs further south, between Jhansi and Bhils\u0101 in the Gw\u0101liyar State.\nFrom the point of view of linguistics Dr. Grierson, in his note, shows that many new facts have come to light confirming my original theory. For instance, there is his discovery of the North-Western family, which completes the \"wedge\" theory. Then dividing the Aryan languages of India into two main families, a Central and a Non-Central, he shows that there is a remarkable series of opposed linguistic facts in the two. The Central family represents the new comers; the non-Central represents the first comers. Thus, the Central family is in the main a set of languages which are in the analytic stage. The original inflections have in the main disappeared, and grammatical needs are supplied by the addition of auxiliary words which have not yet become a part of the main words to which they are attached. Examples are the genitive suffix ka and the auxiliary verbs. Languages of the non-Central family have gone a stage further in linguistic evolution. They were once, in their Sanskrit form, synthetic; then they passed through an analytic stage\u2014some are only passing out of that stage now, and are, like K\u0101\u1e63mir\u012b, so to speak, caught in the act\u2014and are again become synthetic, by the incorporation of the auxiliary words, used in the analytic stage, with the main words to which they were originally attached. Examples are genitive terminations like the Bang\u0101li \u015br, or verbal terminations like the Bang\u0101li \u0101m.\n\nThen, again, Dr. Grierson points out that the non-Central languages evidently used enclitic pronouns from the first. Hence we find them using pronominal suffixes freely, all using them for verbs, and some for nouns. In the Central languages, on the contrary, pronominal suffixes are, so far as he is at present aware, unknown.\n\nIn pronunciation also, he shows, that the two main families are sharply opposed. It is hardly necessary to dwell on the well-known preference of the Central languages for \u1e63-sounds, and of the other languages for s-sounds. This is as old as the A\u015boka inscriptions. There are other preferences to which it is quite unnecessary to refer: they will at once occur to every philologist. A very remarkable difference is the treatment of the sibilants. The Central family hardens them: every sibilant is pronounced as a hard dental s. The non-Central languages seem unable to pronounce an s clearly. In the extreme west, the Greeks found s pronounced like h; and in the east, the Pr\u0101krit grammarians found it softened to a sh sound, which they represented by c. At the present day we find the same shibboleth a test of nationality: in Bengal and part of Mar\u0101\u1e6dha s is weakened to sh, and in Eastern Bengal and Assam it is further weakened, till its pronunciation resembles that of a German ch, and again on the North-Western frontier and in K\u0101\u1e63mir, it has become an h, pure and simple.\nThe limits of these two main families Dr. Grierson defines as follows. The Central main family is bounded on the north by the Himalayas, on the west by, roughly speaking, the river Jhelam, and on the east by the Kosi. The western and eastern boundaries are very wide, and include a good deal of debatable ground in which the two main families meet and overlap. If these limits are narrowed so as to include only the pure languages of the Central main family, the western boundary must be placed at about the meridian of Sirhind in Patiala, and the eastern at about the meridian of Allahabad in the North-Western Provinces. The southern boundary is well defined. It runs east and west through a point about two-thirds of the way across the Central Provinces. On the west, the Central main family merges into Sindhi through Marwari and Bagri, into what Mr. Bomford names \"Western Panjabi\" through Panjabi, and into Kashmiri through Gujar, Dogri, and other hill languages, so that the area covered closely corresponds with that of the ancient madhya desha or Middle Country, the name of which is significant. We learn from the Mahabharata that Krsna, being defeated by Jarasandha of Magadha, fled from Mathura to Gujarat, where he founded a colony. At the present day Gujarat is the only place where the Central main family has burst through the surrounding wall of non-Central languages. The language is a pure Central one. Panjabi contains many unrecorded forms, for which the only explanation is that to the west of Sirhind, or, we may say, to the west of the Sarasvati, the country was originally inhabited by tribes belonging to the non-Central family, who were conquered or absorbed by members of the Central family, whose language gradually superseded theirs just as Hindustani is now gradually superseding Panjabi. Panjabi is a Central language, but it contains many forms which can only have survived (if they were not imported) from an original non-Central dialect.\n\nOn the eastern side, the wider boundary includes Bihari. Most of the Bihar dialects probably belong to the non-Central main family. Hitherto they have been grouped with languages like Avadhi and Baisvaree, which also probably belong to the Central main family. Provisionally, till the linguistic survey is complete, Dr. Grierson is inclined to class the true Bihari dialects, viz., Purbhi, Bhojpuri, Maithili, and Magadhi, as non-Central languages, belonging, like Bangali, to the Eastern group, and Baisvaree and Avadhi and others as an Eastern group of the Central family.\n\nSirhind also means the head of Hindustan, and is still the recognised race-boundary point.\nThus Dr. Grierson arrives at the following classification of the languages of Northern India.\n\n**Central Family.**\n\n- **West-Central Group.**\n  - Bundelkhandi.\n  - Rajasthani (including Marwari, Mevri, Bagri and Malvi).\n  - Gujarati.\n  - Punjabi.\n- **East-Central Group.**\n  - Eastern Hindi (including Baisvarei and Avadhi).\n  - Baghelkhandi.\n  - Chattisgarhi.\n- **Northern Group.**\n  - Western Pahari (including Kulahi, Sirmuri and other connected dialects).\n  - Central Pahari (including Garhwali, Jaunsari, and Kumauni).\n  - Eastern Pahari (also known as Naipali, Khas or Parbati).\n\nThe Classification of the Non-Central family is simple.\n\n**North-Western Group.**\n- Sindhi.\n- Western Punjabi.\n- Kashmiri.\n\n**South-Western Group.**\n- Marathi.\n\n**Eastern Group.**\n- Bihari.\n- Bangali.\n- Assamese.\n- Oriya.\n\n**History of Old Calcutta.**\u2014The last subject on which I propose to touch in my address is one which concerns us \u201cCalcuttaites\u201d more nearly. It is the history of old Calcutta.\n\n---\n\n45 The last may, perhaps, have ultimately to be classed as a separate language, or, perhaps, as a dialect of Bundelkhandi.\n\n46 Possibly Chattisgarhi should come under the non-Central Family. Its classification under the Central Family is provisional.\n\n47 The language-names of this group are taken from the Census Report of 1891.\n\nThe nomenclature is Mr. Baynes.\n\n48 In the rough lists of the Linguistic Survey, Bihari is included in the East-Central Group. This is only provisional.\nThe origin of this city of ours has been the subject of investigation of two members of the Society, B\u0101b\u016b Gaur Das Bysack and Mr. O. R. Wilson. The former published a very interesting paper on the subject in 1891, in the Calcutta Review, and the latter has given an account of his researches in a separate volume on the Early Annals of the English in Bengal, published in 1895. The results of their investigations may be summarised as follows.\n\nDown to the commencement of the sixteenth century S\u0101tg\u0101on was the centre of commerce in Lower Bengal. That town lay on the river Sarasvati, near its junction with the Hugli, a little to the north of the modern town of Hugli. Early in the sixteenth century the Sarasvati began to silt up; and in order to better meet the commerce with Europe, which then began to spring up, the native traders began to move down the river Hugli, in consequence of which movement S\u0101tg\u0101on was deserted and sank into the obscurity of an insignificant group of huts. Among those who deserted S\u0101tg\u0101on were one Sett and four Bysack families. They settled on the Hugli at a place which they named Govindpur after their tutelary deity Govindji, and which stood on the site of the present Fort William and its Esplanade. At the same time they established a place of business a little higher up the river, as a mart for the sale of skeins of thread and woven cloth. It was hence called the S\u016bt\u0101nu\u1e6di H\u0101\u1e6d or \u201cthe Cotton-bale Market,\u201d or in its English form Chuttanutti. This place corresponds to the northern native quarter of the present city.\n\nThe immigration of the Setts and Bysacks occurred not long before 1530, in which year the first Portuguese ship sailed up the river Hugli, and traded with them. The first settlement of the English in these parts took place in 1651, in which year the Company established its headquarters in Hugli, near the now decaying town of S\u0101tg\u0101on. In 1686, however, they found themselves obliged to abandon it, and withdrew to the island of Hijili at the mouth of the Hugli. On his way down the Hugli, Job Charnock, who was in command of the Company\u2019s servants, halted for a few weeks at the Sett and Bysack settlement at S\u016bt\u0101nu\u1e6di. In the following year, having failed to establish himself in Hijili, he returned to S\u016bt\u0101nu\u1e6di, where he maintained\n\n---\n\n47 See Article V, in No. CLXXXIV, p. 305, entitled \u201cKalighat and Calcutta.\u201d\n48 The \u201cIntroductory Account\u201d is based mainly on the late Sir Henry Yule\u2019s edition of the Diary of William Hedges, Esq., Vol. II, 1888.\n49 See Blochmann\u2019s account of S\u0101tg\u0101on in our Journal, Vol. XXXIX, p. 281.\n50 Pronounced Shuttanutti, as in Portuguese, whence the transliteration is borrowed.

The name is found variously spelled: Chuttanutee, Chuttanutesh, Chuttanutty, etc.; also Scoota-Nutty.\nhimself for about one year, from September 1687 to November 1688; but ultimately, after an abortive attempt at Chittagong in 1689, he had to withdraw to Madras. From here he was recalled by the emperor Aurangzeb, and in August 1690 came back for the third time to Sutanuti, where he established the Company once more at the place they had occupied in 1688. This was just below the settlement of the Setta and Bysacks, and above their settlement at Govindpur, at a small village, called Kalikata, or in English Calcutta, on the site of the present European commercial quarter and the Bara Baz\u0101r. Here the English traders lived at first as best they could in tents, huts and boats; but very soon \"as the result of conciliating the Nawab of Bengal's representatives, and of winning general confidence, Armenian and Portuguese merchants were attracted by the English, and as success followed industry, the settlement extended itself southward along the river's bank, bringing into the sphere of occupation the contiguous villages of Calcutta and Govindpur. When in course of a little time further a factory grew into existence, the Company's servants, who had learned the necessity of possessing some central stronghold, obtained permission, in 1696, from the Nawab's Government to surround it with defensive fortifications.\" This was the old Fort William which stood on the site now comprised between Koilagh\u0101t Street and Fairlie Place.\n\nTwo years later, in 1698, through the indulgence of Prince 'Azimu-sh-Sh\u0101h, the grandson of the emperor Aurangzeb, they secured the leasehold rights of the three villages of \"Chuttanattee, Calcutta and Govindpur,\" which henceforth formed one united settlement. Thirteen years later, in 1717, they obtained from the emperor Farrukhsiyar a further grant of 38 villages, out of which several were added to the three villages already amalgamated. Afterwards others were, from time to time, brought within the bounds of the settlement, till at last these combined localities formed the city of Calcutta almost as it now is. The designation of Calcutta is now applied not only to our city which has for its component parts many old villages with histories of their own, but to a Parganah which comprehends the city and many villages at various distances from it; and this Parganah again is one of several which pass under the name of the District of the 24 Parganahs.\"\n\nThe name of \"Calcutta,\" in its English form, first occurs in two Reports submitted in March 1689, by Captain Heath and Job Charnock to the Company's Council in Madras, and refers to the second settlement of the English near Sutanuti in 1688. When they returned for\n\n---\n\n61 See Dr. Busteed's Echoes from Old Calcutta (3rd edition), p. 3.\n62 See Baboo G. D. Bysack's paper, p. 320.\n63 See Hodges' Diaries, edited by Colonel Sir H. Yule, pp. lxxix and lxxxii.\nthe third time to S\u016bt\u0101nu\u1e6di, they again settled on the lands of the \"Calcutta\" village; but the official designation of the settlement appears to have been \"Chuttanuttce,\" for the \"diaries\" are dated from there. How the change of name originated and the little village of Kalik\u0101\u1e6d\u0101 came to give its name to the city of Calcutta is not yet fully accounted for. It seems to me that the change explains itself in this wise. The early diaries of the English Settlement between 1688 and 1698 are all called \"Chuttanuttce Diaries.\" These diaries always run from the December of the preceding year to the November of the following year. The diary for 1699, that is to say, for December 1698 to November 1699, is the first dated from Calcutta; for I find that the diary for 1704-5 is called the seventh from Calcutta. It follows that the change of name, from Chuttanuttce to Calcutta, must have taken place shortly before December 1698. Now in July 1698, the Company became the revenue collector, for the Moghul Government, of the three villages S\u016bt\u0101nu\u1e6di, Calcutta, and Govindpur. In the \u0100in-i-Akbar\u012b, the village of Kalik\u0101\u1e6d\u0101 (Calcutta) is enumerated as one of the mahals or revenue subdivisions of the District of S\u0101tgaon. As such it belongs to the fiscal survey, made in 1587, by Todar Mall, the well-known Finance Minister of the emperor Akbar. The villages of S\u016bt\u0101nu\u1e6di and Govindpur, founded shortly before, in 1530, are not mentioned in the fiscal survey; they evidently lay within the fiscal subdivision of Calcutta. It is natural to conclude that when the English Company acquired the collectorate of that subdivision in 1698, they made its old and well-known fiscal name the official designation of their settlement, especially as their factory and fort lay within the limits of the village of Kalik\u0101\u1e6d\u0101.\n\nFor the very early age of that village a curious piece of evidence was discovered in 1892, by Mah\u0101mahop\u0101dhyaya Pandit Hara Prasad Sh\u0101stri. He found in an old manuscript an account of a voyage down the river Hugli, written in 1495 by a Bengali author named Bipra D\u0101s. That writer enumerates all the towns and villages which the voyager, a certain C\u0101nd Sad\u0101gar, passed on both sides of the river. Among them occurs the village of Kalik\u0101\u1e6d\u0101, but neither S\u016bt\u0101nu\u1e6di, nor Govind-\n\n---\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n64 See Wilson's *Early Annals*, p. 236, where it is called *Calcutta Diary No. 7*. The full name of the Calcutta diaries was *Diary and Consultation Book of the London Company's Council at Fort William in Bengal*. This is accounted for by the fact that the Old Fort was completed in 1697, just before the change of name took place.\n\n65 See Colonel Jarrett's Translation, Vol. II, p. 140. The \u0100in-i-Akbar\u012b was completed by Abul Fazl in 1597. See also Mr. J. Beames' paper in the *Journal*, Royal Asiatic Society, for 1896, p. 102.\n\n66 See his paper in our *Proceedings* for 1892, p. 193.\npar, which circumstance shows that while Kalik\u0101t\u0101 existed in 1495, the other two villages did not.\n\nThe idea still much entertained that Calcutta has received its name from the celebrated shrine of K\u0101ligh\u0101t on the \"Old Ganges,\" is altogether wrong. Not to mention the philological difficulties which are fatal to the identification of Kalik\u0101t\u0101 with K\u0101ligh\u0101tta, their identity is totally precluded by the fact that in 1495 both localities were in existence and occupied the same, or nearly the same, places as they do now. Bipra D\u0101s's voyager, having come by the town of H\u00fcgli and other places, passed the village of Kalik\u0101t\u0101, and journeying on reached B\u0113t\u014dr, near the modern Shibpur, and thence he went on to K\u0101ligh\u0101t, where he worshipped at the shrine of K\u0101lik\u0101. The fact is that the derivation of Calcutta from K\u0101ligh\u0101t is one of the many utterly unfounded popular etymologies. Its real derivation is still quite unknown. The probability is that it is a word from some aboriginal language; and this would be only one more evidence pointing to a considerable antiquity for the site of Calcutta.\n\nWith regard to the origin of the K\u0101ligh\u0101t shrine, I may add that according to a current tradition it was founded, early in the fifteenth century, by an ascetic called Jangal Gir Chanrangi. \"One evening he was performing his devotions by the bank of the 'Old Ganges' which was then a great stream flowing south of Calcutta, when suddenly a bright light shone round about him, and that same night, when he had gone to sleep, the goddess K\u0101li appeared to him in a dream, and told him that the spot was one of those holy places which had once received a portion of her severed body. The next day he dug up the ground, and proved the truth of his vision. The sacred emblems thus miraculously found, being the toes of her right foot, were set up for worship in a small wooden house on the bank of the \u0100di-Gang\u0101.\" From the original founder of this wooden shrine, our well-known fashionable quarter, now known as Chowringhee, but which at that time was a wild jungal, is supposed to have obtained its name. The present substantial temple was erected in 1809 by the S\u0101var\u1e47a Chaudharis of Beh\u0101l\u0101.\n\nThe story of the Black Hole, as you know, is intimately connected with the Old Fort William, which as I have already remarked, was built in 1696-97. At the time of that tragedy, in 1756, Calcutta \"extended in a crescent along the bank of the river from north to south for about three miles (say from modern Chitpur Bridge to the site of the present Fort). Standing nearly midway between those limits was the little Old Fort. The houses of the English inhabitants were scattered in\n\n---\n\n67 See Wilson's Early Annals, pp. 129, 130.\nlarge enclosures for about half a mile to the north and south of the Fort, and for about a quarter of a mile to the east of it. Beyond the English houses were closely clustered the habitations and huts of the natives; the better classes of them, such as the Sette and Bysacks, dwelt to the north, the lower sort in the Bazars to the east and south.\" The story of the tragedy of the Black Hole is well-known, and I need not repeat it, but till the commencement of the period I am now reviewing its exact site was very imperfectly known. For the exact determination of it we are indebted to two members of our Society, Messrs. R. R. Bayne and C. R. Wilson. The results of their investigations are published in our Journal, and may be thus summarised. In 1880, when the new East India Railway Offices were being erected in Clive Street, the excavation made for the foundation of these Offices laid bare the remains of an old wall. Mr. Bayne, who was in charge of the works, knowing that he was working on the locality of the Old Fort William, at once resolved to utilize as well as he could the opportunity of determining its topography. In February 1883, he laid before the Asiatic Society the results of his investigations. Unfortunately they suffered under two disadvantages. In the first place, the portions of the old building actually excavated were on the northern and least interesting side of the Fort. In the second place, Mr. Bayne had no proper plan to guide him in his conjectures as to the position and nature of the remaining portions of the Fort. When Mr. Wilson resumed the investigations in 1891, he could do so under far more favourable conditions owing to the erection of the New Government Offices in Dalhousie Square. He also had the advantage of being guided in his excavations by a detailed plan of Fort William in 1753, a photographed copy of which was presented to the Society by Mr. T. R. Munro. He thus succeeded in discovering considerable remains of the buildings on the south side of the Fort, where the Black Hole and other places of interest had been situated. In fact, his investigations were so successful that it was found possible to draw up a plan of the Old Fort, accurately showing its position with reference to the modern houses now standing on or near its site, together with the main features of its principal buildings. He first discovered the true dimensions and position of the east gate of the Fort. The gate was found to be much smaller than Mr. Bayne had conjectured it would be. Its centre lay on the central line of the road in front of Writers' Buildings, which has always been one of the principal streets of the city. In the next place, Mr. Wilson traced out, as far\n\n---\n\nSee Dr. Busteed's *Echoes of Old Calcutta*, p. 5.\n\nSee Volume LII, p. 105, and Vol. LXII, p. 104.\nas was possible, the main features of the factory within the Fort, in which were situated the apartments of the Governor. This was in its day one of the finest English houses in India. It consisted of a main building facing the river, with two wings behind at right angles to the main building. Almost all the foundation walls of these wings were traced out by excavations, and the position of the walls of the main building was ascertained, although the walls themselves could not be traced out, as the site of the main building is at present occupied by the Government Opium Godowns and by the out-houses of the Custom House. Mr. Wilson also endeavoured as far as possible to ascertain the position of the south curtain, of the south-east bastion, and of that portion of the east curtain which lay between the south-east bastion and the east gate, together with the adjoining arcades and chambers. Considerable difficulty was experienced by him in coming to any definite conclusion on these points; for, in the first place, the Post Office covers the site of the south-east bastion and the adjacent south curtain wall, and so prevents any extended excavations in this region; and in the second place, the plan of the old Fort, which has elsewhere proved to be extremely accurate, seems at this point to fail. Still, in spite of these difficulties, Mr. Wilson was able to definitely fix the position of the south curtain wall and of three parallel lines of arches within it, and to show that tradition was right in asserting that the old arcade and arches which still stand in the Post Office compound were part of the old Fort. The arches of the south face of this arcade are what remains of the first line of arches within the south curtain, and the arches in the middle of the arcade are what remain of the second line of arches. The foundation wall of the third and innermost line of arches was traced out for some distance. It was found in the passage on the north of the Post Office. Starting from this wall, or, what is practically the same thing, from the north face of the Post Office, Mr. Wilson traced out the east curtain wall as far as the east gate, the inner wall containing the chambers built against the curtain, and the wall of the piazza or verandah running west of the chambers. The Black Hole prison was one of these chambers; but to fix its exact position it would have been necessary to ascertain, not merely the positions of the curtain wall and the inner wall, which formed its eastern and western walls, but also the position of the cross-walls which formed its northern and southern boundaries, and divided it off from the other chambers built against the east curtain. Unfortunately these cross-walls were run up with hardly any foundation, and hence it was found extremely difficult to trace their position. One such cross-wall was found at a distance of about 100 ft. from the centre of\nthe east gate, and to the south of this there is another cross-wall which Mr. Bayne discovered in 1883, and which according to his theories must have been the north wall of the prison. According to Mr. Wilson this cannot have been the case; because the space south of this cross-wall is shown by the plan of the Fort to have been occupied by the foot of the staircase leading to the south-east bastion, but he thinks it quite possible that it is the south wall of the prison. Concerning this and other points in the topography of the Fort additional information may perhaps be obtained hereafter by further excavations and by the examination of old records.\n\nThe history of the Company's Ecclesiastical Establishment in Bengal from its foundation in 1677 to the close of the eighteenth century has been explored by another member of our Society, the Rev. H. B. Hyde, and published in a series of ten short memoirs. The materials for these researches previous to the sack of Calcutta in 1756 were found almost wholly in the Company's archives at Westminster. Subsequent to that date a parallel series exists in the Vestry Records of St. John's Church, in the 'Ecclesiastical' records of the old Mayor's Court of Calcutta, and in the Consultations of the Public and Military Departments of the Bengal Government. The first Chaplain of 'the Bay,' John Evans, had a remarkable career which ended in the Irish Bishopric of Meath. This Mr. Evans was Chaplain of 'the Bay' at the time of the founding of Calcutta. His successors Benjamin Adams and William Anderson promoted the building of the first Presidency Church. This occupied a site now covered by the west end of Writers' Buildings and, as shown by the consecration documents which have been found in the Bishop of London's Registry, was dedicated on the 5th of June, 1709, to St. Anne, doubtless with complimentary reference to the name of the reigning sovereign. Specimens of the sermons of Mr. Anderson have been found in the British Museum; they curiously illustrate the disorderly state of the factory at that period. The next three Chaplains in succession filled the fifteen years previous to 1726, counting four intervals of two or three years each occasioned by Chaplains' deaths. The tomb of one of these victims of the climate is in the Dacca cemetery. During these fifteen years the project which resulted in the foundation of the Calcutta Charity School (now united with the Free School) was set afoot. The Parish Register of St. Anne's has been found in duplicate at the India Office, and the whole of it, from 1713 until the destruction of the Church by the Naw\u0101b's army in 1756, has been transcribed and added to the Records of St.\n\nSee the Annual Address in our Proceedings for 1892.\nJohn's Church. In 1726 arrived a Chaplain who was destined to set the climate for 30 years at defiance, and then to perish not by any Indian sickness but by suffocation in the Black Hole; his name was Gervase Bellamy. He saw the old Court House, which occupied the site of the present St. Andrew's Kirk, built in about 1729. The building was first intended as a school house, but soon gave shelter to the Mayor's Court, and became the Calcutta Town Hall. Eventually Government took it over and still pay over the monthly rent of 800 sicca rupees on account of it to the Select Vestry of St. John's and the other Governors of the Free School. Bellamy witnessed also the furious cyclone of 1737, which, it appears, was not accompanied by an earthquake as is generally supposed, but in which the tall spire of St. Anne's was blown off. The traditions of this celebrated storm, as Mr. Hyde has shown, are much exaggerated. In 1743, Bellamy received a junior colleague in the Chaplaincy, the third successor of whom was Robert Mapletoft, who arrived in 1749. In the siege of 1756, this man was appointed a Captain-Lieutenant, and did good work on the defences. He perished among the refugees at Fulta, while Bellamy was found lying suffocated hand in hand with his son in the Black Hole. On the recovery of Calcutta from the Nawab Siraju-d-daulah, the first incumbent of the Chaplaincy was Richard Cobbe, R.N., who had accompanied Admiral Watson to Calcutta. He died after a few months' service. During his brief incumbency the Portuguese Church in Moorgihatta was taken over for English use and remained the presidency church until 1760. Cobbe was succeeded by Butler who in 1758 welcomed into the settlement the celebrated S. P. C. K. Missionary John Zachary Kiermander. He survived to see St. John's Chapel built in the ruins of the old Fort in 1760. In January 1762, a month after his death, he was succeeded by Samuel Stavely, R.N., who died nine months later. His colleague, William Hirst, R.N., F.R.S., was one of the most accomplished men who ever belonged to the Bengal Ecclesiastical Establishment. A long communication of this, respecting the great earthquake of 1762 and also an eclipse of the sun in the same year, is to be found in the Transactions of the Royal Society. Following Hirst, William Parry succeeded as Senior Chaplain in 1765, and Thomas Yate in 1769. The latter had a singular experience in being taken prisoner by the French and confined on board a French frigate at the Mauritius. In both situations he suffered horrible hardships, and in the latter imprisonment he even prayed \"that one of the soldiers might be permitted to shoot him through the head.\" He survived all his misfortunes, however, and died as first Garrison Chaplain of Calcutta in 1782. William Johnson became Senior Presidency Chap-\nlain in 1784, and to his efforts is due the building by public subscription of the present St. John's which was consecrated in 1787. On his retiring from India in 1788, Thomas Blanchard became Senior and John Owen, Junior Presidency Chaplain. Of the latter a large private correspondence has been discovered, dated mostly from Calcutta and is not a little curious. In 1788 the presidency chaplains in conjunction with David Brown, the Garrison Chaplain, and Robertes Carr, the Chaplain to the Fourth Brigade, made an admirable effort to secure Government English Schools for the native population. Their memorial to Government on the subject is printed by Mr. Hyde in one of his memoirs. Nothing came of it, and indeed it appears to have been quite overlooked even by writers on Education in British India. In this same year the Ecclesiastical Establishment which then comprised nine Chaplains was put on a new footing. Brigade Chaplaincies were abolished and Barrackpur, Dinapur, Chun\u0101r, Berhampur, Fathgarh, and Cawnpur became quasi-parishes, with resident incumbents. Mr. Hyde has traced out the succession of Chaplains in each appointment until the close of the century, and collected a great number of personal notices respecting each of them, especially regarding David Brown, who eventually became Senior Presidency Chaplain. He has similarly compiled in much detail the history of the Charity and Free Schools down to the close of the century.\n\nWriters differ much in accounting for the origin of the Charity School: none seem to fix the date of its beginning early enough. Mr. Hyde points out that its establishment was a cherished project of Chaplain Briercliffe and the Society for Promoting Christian knowledge in 1713, and that in 1720 the scheme after many checks was actually afoot and Chaplain Thomlinson bequeathed Rs. 80 towards it. Mr. Hyde thinks that the school had been in existence sometime before 1732; perhaps 1729 is as near a conjecture as can be made as to the date of its beginning work. It was first supported out of the income of the \"Charity Stock\" of the Church. The origin of this property must be sought very early in the history of the Chaplaincy. There existed in H\u00fcgli, before the factory removed to Calcutta, an institution of \"guardians of the poor,\" the funds of which arose from fines levied upon English officials of the factory who remained out late at night, who swore profanely, or who neglected attendance at divine worship. This institution seems to have disappeared in the dissolution of manners in the early years of the Calcutta factory, and local paupers had stipends from the Company's Cash. With the improvement of parochial organization on the consecration of the Church in 1709, such administration of charity passed, it is to b-\npresumed, naturally into the hands of the Select Vestry, with whom money must have slowly accumulated after the sacred building was finished and furnished; for all expenditure for repairs and establishment must have been borne by the Company, and Church Order required that alms should be collected at the Offertory for the benefit of the poor. The fund thus accumulating would have been augmented by legacies and donations, and it is known that the fees received for the use of palls at funerals went into it. The Charity Stock therefore must have been already of ancient origin, when its income became permanently devoted to the maintenance of the Charity School. In 1731, \"an eminent merchant\" (to be identified probably with Mr. Richard Bourchier) wrote home from Calcutta that there were eight boys on the foundation and about 40 others. The eight foundationers were \"maintained and clothed after the manner of the Blue-coat boys at Christ's Hospital.\" After the sack of Calcutta the School was re-opened with 20 foundationers, and duplicate promissory notes for Rs. 20,000, representing the Charity Stock, were granted to \"the Wardens of the Parish.\" Within a few years time the Court House (or rather the portion of it used for Magisterial purposes) was bringing in a rent of Rs. 2,000 a year. This in 1767 was increased to Rs. 4,160, and in 1776 to Rs. 6,180. Two years later the Government had taken over the whole building and fixed the rent at the rate still paid, viz., Rs. 800 a month. Out of the revenues thus realized from the Charity Stock and the Court House 20 boys were at this time maintained on the foundation of the School. On leaving School the boys were for the most part bound out as apprentices. In 1787 there were 30 boy foundationers, and four girls. In 1789 there was 25 boys and 16 girls. In 1789 the Free School was founded which soon coalesced with the Charity School. In 1793 there were 40 boys and 30 girls on the 'Charity,' and slightly larger numbers on the \"Free\" foundation. In the same year the Jaun Bazar property was purchased which the United School now occupies. In 1800 the two institutions were formally united, and possessed a united capital of something over two lakhs of rupees \"independent of dead stock and contingencies.\" Some dieting bills of this period remain, and are curious particularly as recording prices. 18 seers of milk, and 25 loaves of bread each were reckoned to the rupee, six sheep cost Rs. 7-6-0, and Rice Rs. 1-4-0 a maund. By 5th April 1813, 252 children were entirely maintained by the Free School, and about 32 day scholars were educated with the rest under Dr. Bell's system. By 1817 the number of foundationers had arisen to 205 boys and 92 girls.\n\nThe account of the Chaplaincy and the Charity School is from a note kindly supplied to me by Mr. Hyde.\nAnd now, gentlemen, I offer you my sincere thanks for the honour you conferred on me last year in electing me your President. It will always remain one of my pleasantest recollections of India that I was permitted to close my career in this country with that distinction; and I have the additional satisfaction of knowing that in the Hon'ble H. H. Risley, C.I.E., I shall have a successor who is distinguished not only by his position in his own Service, but also by his achievements in scientific research.\n\nThe President announced that the Scrutineers reported the result of the elections to be as follows:\n\nPresident.\nThe Hon.

Middlemiss, Esq. Dr. J. Scully.\n\nMr. Frank Finn, Deputy Superintendent of the Indian Museum, exhibited some living specimens of the Indian Goosander (Merganser comatus), and read the following note on its walking powers.\n\nThe specimen of the Indian Goosander (Merganser comatus Salvadori) which I have the honour of exhibiting to-night has been very kindly lent to me for the purpose by Mr. W. Rutledge of Entally, who tells me that this is the only specimen of the bird he has ever received\nin the course of his long and extensive experience as a dealer in living animals.\n\nThe bird being so rare in captivity, I have thought it worth while to point out, by means of this specimen, that Mr. Hume was mistaken in thinking that the species is unable to walk. He says (Game Birds and Wildfowl of India, Vol. III, p. 301): \"On land one only sees them resting near the water's edge, and when disturbed they shuffle on their breasts into the river. I do not think that they can walk at all. Anyhow I have always seen them just half-glide, half-wriggle, breast foremost, and I think touching the rock, into the water.\"*\n\nBut from the actions of the bird now exhibited, it is easy to see that the Goosander can walk like other ducks, and does so in the same attitude as they, though it is naturally not so active on land as the less aquatic species. No doubt the birds seen by Mr. Hume were simply disinclined to stand up and walk properly when they had but a very short distance to go, and preferred the lazier method of locomotion he describes in the passage above quoted.\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1.

On certain imperfectly known Points in the Habits and Economy of Birds. No. 1. On the position of the feet of the \"Picarian\" Birds and of Parrots in flight.\u2014By F. Finn, B.A., F.Z.S., Deputy Superintendent of the Indian Museum.\n\nAlthough the habits of birds, more especially those connected with nidification and the care of the young, have been long and carefully\n\n* The bird was here put down on the floor and made to walk about, which it did in the ordinary manner of ducks, though unwillingly, having probably not recovered condition after a long journey from the Hills. A specimen of the allied Merganser\nstudied, much remains to be done in the observation of living birds, even when these belong to quite common and well-known species. This consideration serves me for an excuse for introducing a few notes which I have been led to make on certain points in the economy of birds which appear to me to have been insufficiently studied, and to have, possibly, some bearing on the difficult problem of avian classification. Students of other groups of animals\u2014I may instance Bats and Butterflies\u2014avail themselves of peculiarities of attitude, etc., in their subjects for taxonomical purposes, and with regard to Birds I see no reason why such peculiarities as those to which I draw attention below should not be taken into consideration by systematic ornithologists equally with nidificatory, distributional, and dietetic variations.\n\nON THE POSITION OF THE FEET IN FLIGHT AMONG \"PICARIAN\" BIRDS AND PARROTS.\n\nI will first notice a point which has lately attracted considerable attention among ornithologists\u2014the position of the feet in certain groups of birds when the members of these are on the wing. It may be taken, I think, as fairly settled that Waders and Waterfowl, Game-birds, Pigeons, and Birds-of-Prey, carry their feet behind when in full flight, irrespective of the length of those members. But with regard to the mostly short-legged Picari\u00e6 and the Parrots I am not aware that any observations have been made, and I have therefore taken particular notice of these birds, with the following results:\n\nTo take the Parrots first. I long watched the common Indian Parrakeets (chiefly *Palaeornis torquatus*) when at large, in order to discover where their legs were placed when the birds were on the wing; but owing to the swiftness of their flight, and the fact that the feet are ordinarily concealed beneath the feathers of a flying bird, I was unsuccessful, till one day a *Palaeornis torquatus* got into the Bird Gallery of the Museum, and flying to and fro overhead, gave me an excellent opportunity of observing that its feet were carried behind. As the gallery is a very large one, and the bird took long flights, I have no doubt but that this is the normal position for the species, and very probably for Parrots in general.\n\nAmong the so-called \"Picari\u00e6,\" using the term in its widest sense, I have noted the carriage of the feet in flying Hoopoes, Kingfishers, Rollers, Hornbills, Barbets, Woodpeckers, and Cuckoos, and will now\n\n*Cassier* (not distinguished from the present species by Hume, who calls both *Mergus merganser* op. cit.), which I saw last year in the London Zoological Gardens constantly walked about quite freely, as did some Smews (*Mergus albellus*) observed at the same time and place.\ntake each of these groups in detail as to this point. In Hoopoes I have been unable to get a sight of the feet of a bird flying at large, but by buying specimens of *Upupa epops* in the Calcutta Bazaar, and letting them out in my quarters, I found that the feet are constantly kept drawn up to the body, as the bird flies\u2014never extended behind, at least in a room. In Hornbills, on the other hand in spite of the supposed alliance of these birds to the *Upupidae*, the feet appear to be extended behind in flight. I saw this very distinctly at any rate in two specimens of the common black-and-white *Anthracoceros*; the bird in each case was a tame one, but flying out of doors. With regard to Rollers, I have suspected, from watching birds at liberty, that the common *Coracias indica* carries its feet behind; but I could not be certain till I let out a tame bird I had in my bedroom, and found that though the feet were at first allowed to hang like a crow's when starting, they were undoubtedly stretched out behind the bird when well under way.\n\nOf Kingfishers I have observed more than one species. A *Ceryle rudis* I brought up from the nest and allowed to fly about at liberty for this very observation, distinctly carried its feet behind, as also do *Alcedo ispida* and *Halcyon smyrnensis*, as I have been able to observe with wild birds; though the former takes a lot of watching to determine a point like this! The Laughing Jackass (*Dacelo gigas*) carries the legs behind also, as I made out with the keeper's assistance in the fine aviary at the London Zoological Gardens, when in England on leave last year (1897).\n\nWith Barbets my only observations that were at all satisfactory were made on a specimen of *Thereiceryx seytonicus* in a very large compartment of the Bird House in the Calcutta Zoological Gardens. Here this bird constantly kept its feet drawn up to the body when on the wing. Some Blue-cheeked Barbets (*Cyanops caerulescens*) in a smaller compartment in another house, did the same, but for reasons to be presently given I do not set so much value on this observation.\n\nOf Woodpeckers I have observed only two individuals of our common Gold-backed Woodpecker (*Brachypternus aurantius*); a young female I kept myself and let out both in the open and in my room, and a male in the large aviary in the Zoological Gardens above referred to. Both birds carried the feet drawn up to the body like the Barbets, or like Passerine birds. In the case of Cuckoos I have observed, with wild birds, that both the Ko\u00ebl (*Eudynamis honorata*) and the Crow-pheasant (*Centropus sinensis*) carry their feet behind when well under way. I have seen this particularly well in the case of the last species, whose feet in flight have exactly the same position behind as I have seen in\nPheasant and a domestic Fowl, in England. A Hierococcyx appeared to have its feet drawn up in a short flight.\n\nDomestic fowls, however, in their short flights, usually carry their feet in front, and this I noticed in a young Centropus I had free but tame in the Museum compound, and in a Ko\u00ebl in the large aviary above referred to. As this is done by Pigeons also when starting, though they afterwards extend their feet behind, I do not feel absolutely certain about the Woodpeckers, Barbets and Hoopoes, but as I never saw any backward extension of the feet in these birds, I think that the forward position is really the permanent one in them, though I should have liked a good look at a bird in a long flight overhead, at liberty if possible.\n\nWith regard to the Parrot and Roller, though these birds were confined, the former had plenty of room for a long flight, and as to the latter, I have never met with any bird which first extends its feet behind and then draws them up, so that I consider the observations on these as sufficiently conclusive for the species in question, if not for their allies.\n\nFrom these experiences I conclude, that supposing the same habit of carrying the feet to run through a family, the forward position of the feet in flight probably characterises Hoopoes, Woodpeckers, and Barbets, and the backward one certainly obtains among Kingfishers, Rollers, Hornbills, Cuckoos, and Parrots.\n\n5. On the different kinds of salutation used by the Santals.\u2014By The Revd. P. O. Boddington, Mohulpahari, Santal Parganas.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThe Santals have different forms of saluting each other varying according to their mutual family position. Their social position has, on account of their patriarchial organization, no influence in this respect, as, e.g., even a pargana or overchief will have to bow to a poor rayot if this last one has a higher family position.\n\nEquals alone salute each other in a manner equal on both sides; if one of the saluting parties has a higher family position than the other one, this is most clearly shown in their manner of saluting each other, the inferior person having to make his obeisance, the higher one receiving the salute. Their customs of salutation are beautiful.\n\nThe Santal name for salutation is johar, and they have four different kinds, viz. (1) doogh' johar (lit., bow-salutation), used between all people of whom one has a higher family position than the other, and who have not to use any of the other kinds of salutation. The inferior person, whether man or woman, bows to the superior one, men in one way, women in another, and the higher one receives or acknowledges the salutation, men in their manner, and women in their.\n2. Baho\u00f1harea johar, used by bahognharea (certain brothers and sisters-in-law) and by coparents-in-law, when of different sex. They bow to each other and keep their hands shadowing over their eyes.\n\n3. Balacea johar, used between coparents-in-law, when of same sex. Their salutation is very elaborate and rather curious; it is fully described in the paper: they draw their hands backwards and forwards between each other (when men), butt each other's shoulders, etc.\n\n4. So johar, used when the saluting persons from some cause or other do not know each other's mutual position. In this case they do not bow, but receive each other's salutation (just as they do in the first mentioned kind of salutation).\n\nThe now living Santals use to salute each other at festivals, ceremonials, coming on or from a visit, when meeting away from home, etc., but now as a rule not when meeting in their village. They do not salute an assembly of people en bloc, but must salute separately everybody, or as many as they think fit or necessary of those present.\n\nSome words are added about their manner of saluting their boggas, which is mostly done kneeling. They keep both their hands before their face with the finger-tips joined\u2014called jorhat\u2014and then bow. The jorhat is sometimes used by people crying for mercy, supplicating, etc., and is by custom imposed on an outcasted man, when he at the entrance to his village stands to receive those coming to receive him into the tribe again.\n\n6. Preliminary notes on an archeological tour with the Buner Field Force.\u2014By Dr. M. A. Stein.\n\nI have just returned from Buner with Sir Bindon Blood's force and hasten to send you these brief preliminary notes regarding the objects of archeological interest I was able to examine during the short occupation of that territory.\n\nYou are aware that acting upon information and advice kindly given to me by Major Deane, at present political officer for Swat, Dir and Chitral, I had applied to the Punjab Government to be deputed with the punitive expedition against Buner for the purpose of an archeological survey. Buner which comprises the portion of the ancient Udyana situated between the Swat Valley and the Indus, had previously been wholly inaccessible to Europeans, and hence a terra incognita also from an antiquarian point of view. My application, thanks largely to the kind interest taken in the matter by Mr. Dano, the Chief Secretary to the Local Government, and my friend Mr. Maynard, the Junior Secretary, was readily approved by Sir Mackworth Young, our present Lieutenant-Governor.\nWhen returning from my short Christmas tour into Lower Swat I saw Sir Bindon Blood, the General Commanding the Malakand Field Force, who informed me of the early date fixed for the expedition, and very kindly promised me his assistance. I had just time to go down to Lahore and conduct the annual Convocation of the University. Then I hurried back and caught up the division on the 5th instant at Katlang while it was on the march to the Bunar border.\n\nOn the 6th we reached Sanghao, at the entrance of the Tang Pass, where there are several old sites from which interesting Greco-Buddhist Sculptures have at various times been obtained. Accompanying the General's reconnaissance up the defile I was able to trace the remains of an ancient road leading to the pass, though not so well preserved as those of the old roads over the Malakand and Shahkot Passes. On the following day the Tang Pass was taken after some fighting, the main honors of which fell to my friends of the 20th Regiment Punjab Infantry whose Pathans and Dargas climbed in splendid style the steep hills commanding the pass on the west. I watched the interesting engagement from the position taken up by the mountain batteries in action and climbed up to the pass soon after it was carried. With the troops of General Meiklejohn's Brigade I reached that evening the village of Kingargulai to the north of the pass.\n\nFrom that place I was able to survey during the following two days numerous ruins of evidently old date. They cover a series of rocky spurs which descend from the higher ranges into the Nawdund Valley on the west and into the valley leading down to the east towards Bam-pokha. The ruins consist chiefly of strongly built dwelling-places raised on high masonry terraces. Their position on narrow ridges difficult of access and their massive construction make it clear that they were erected with a view to defence. Some groups of ruins resemble in fact small castles. Certain details of the construction leave no doubt as to these remains going back to pre-Muhammadan times.\n\nRuins of similar description I found in great number on various hill spurs visited from the next camp of the Brigade at Juwar. They point to the presence in earlier times of a large and well-to-do population a fact easily accounted for by the fertile character of the tract.\n\nThe resignation with which the Bunar tribes accepted their defeat and their ready submission to the terms of Government made the progress of the expedition through the country far more rapid than I might have wished for the purposes of my search. But this made it at least possible for me to move with a small escort to considerable distances from the camps,\u2014a thing which among other border tribes\nlike the Afridis or Waziris would manifestly have been out of question. I was thus able, at the expense of a good deal of hard marching and climbing, to visit most of the places on either side of the main valley of Bun\u00e4r where the information previously collected or ocular observation led me to expect ancient remains. The independence I thus enjoyed did yet, of course, not enable me to make up in the point of thoroughness for the disadvantages arising from want of time.\n\nAmong the objects examined in the side valleys to the north were rock-cut sculptures representing \u00c7iva and other Hindu deities. They were found in two places at the foot of spurs descending from Mount Ilm which rises on the watershed between Sw\u00e4t and Bun\u00e4r, and forms a very striking feature in the landscape of both territories.\n\nThese sculptures show that Buddhism which we know to have been prevalent in these regions for so long a time, was here as elsewhere in India closely associated with all popular features of the Hindu religious system. In connection herewith it is a matter of interest that my enquiries have shown Mount Ilm to be still a place of pilgrimage for the scanty Hindu population (chiefly Khattri traders) scattered through Bun\u00e4r and Sw\u00e4t. The Tirthas visited by the pilgrims are situated close to the now snow-capped summit of Mount Ilm. Owing to the great height of the latter they could unfortunately not be reached from the nearest camps at Juwar and P\u0101dsh\u0101h. Curiously enough the most sacred Muhammadan shrine of Bun\u00e4r, the Zi\u0101rat of Pir B\u0101b\u0101 \u0160\u0101h\u012bb, lies at the latter place, close to the foot of Ilm. Does the position of this shrine presuppose\u2014as it certainly would were it found in Kashmir,\u2014the previous existence of a popular Hindu or Buddhist place of pilgrimage in the neighbourhood?\n\nRemains of st\u016bpas I found at Bhai close to P\u0101dsh\u0101h and at Girav\u0113\u015bi further to the west. But the more numerous and important ruins of this kind are situated in the main valley of Bun\u00e4r, that of the Baranda river. From Bamp\u014dkha down to B\u0101jkatha in the east I traced a series of such ruins, some of them having monasteries of considerable size attached. Conspicuous among these remains are the great St\u016bpa and Sangh\u0101r\u0101ma, about 1\u00bd miles below Tursak, the largest place of modern Bun\u00e4r. A trial excavation conducted here during the few available hours with the assistance of a small party of sappers brought to light a corner of the stucco-ornamented st\u016bpa-base, and showed the great depth to which the original level of the several courts has been filled up with masses of d\u00e9bris. Weeks of work would be required for the proper clearing of this and similar sites.\n\nThat Tursak was an important place also in old times is made evident by the numerous ruins of fortified dwelling-places on the neighbouring heights.\nAnother place of importance for the ancient topography of Bun\u00e4r is undoubtedly the site near the present Sunigr\u0101m. This village which bears an old Hindu name, occupies a position on the right bank of the Baranda River where it enters the broad open portion of the valley known as Panjpau. To the South of the village rises a high mound of rough masonry which must have once formed a St\u016bpa of at least 150 feet diameter. Close by is a remarkably well preserved ancient well with stairs leading down to the water. On a rocky ridge above the village and overlooking the valley are the comparatively well preserved ruins of a large monastery, built partly on high walled-up terraces. The walls and vaulted roofs of the several halls are of massive construction, and have stood the test of time and of other destructive agencies better than any other old buildings examined in Bun\u00e4r. Unfortunately, treasure seekers have been at work here too. The St\u016bpa in front of the monastery has been dug into long ago, evidently for the sake of the relics deposited below it.\n\nThis fate has overtaken also the fine St\u016bpa which stands near the village of Takhtabund, a short distance to the east of Sanigr\u0101m. It still reaches to a height of over 50 feet from the ground. A broad cutting has been made to the centre of this mass of masonry and through its whole height.\n\nAll the St\u016bpas and other important structures were carefully measured with the help of the Surveyor supplied to me from the Public Works Department, and their plans will be given in the Report I am now preparing. It is very probable that some of these structures must be connected with the several sacred Buddhist sites which are mentioned by the Chinese pilgrims, in particular Hiuen Thsiang, as situated at some distance to the south of Mungali, the old Capital of Sw\u0101t, the present Manglaur. The survey now made of them will thus help to establish with greater certainty the ancient topography of the regions once comprised in Udy\u0101na.\n\nThe rapid surrender of the Bun\u00e4r tribes and of those of the neighbouring Chamla valley had made a further advance to the east towards the Indus unnecessary. The early withdrawal of the force by the route of the Amb\u0113la Pass deprived me of the opportunity I had eagerly hoped for, to visit the heights of Mount Mah\u0101ban. It has always appeared to me that of the various locations suggested for Alexander's Aornos, that proposed by the late General Abbott who identified that famous stronghold with Mount Mah\u0101ban, was by far the most probable. But without a close examination of the actual topography of that mountain\u2014which has not yet been surveyed, no decisive evidence can be expected.\n\nIf Mah\u0101ban itself remained still inaccessible I had at least the\nsatisfaction of approaching it closer than has apparently been possible on any previous occasion. A rapid ride down the Chamla valley, close up to the border of Amazai territory did not reveal much of antiquarian interest, but enabled me to collect useful information about an extensive group of ruins, known as Sh\u0101hk\u016bt, which crown the summit of the mountain. It would be hazardous to express an opinion as to their character or origin until they have actually been surveyed. But when will this time come?\n\nIt was on the last day of the occupation that I made this ride towards the snow-covered slopes of Mount Mah\u0101ban. When I returned in the afternoon to the Amb\u0101la Pass, the rear guard of the force had already far advanced into that famous defile. What I saw last of Bun\u0113r territory had thus also the charm of historical associations, not less stirring because they were modern.\n\nWith reference to the above I may safely say that I have spared no effort to utilize to the full the brief twelve days I could spend on Bun\u0113r soil. What makes me regret more than anything else the shortness of the time allowed, is the fact that I was unable to see a single one of Major Deane's puzzling inscriptions in situ. My article published in the Bengal Asiatic Society's Journal (Part I, 1898, No. 1) shows that a number of these inscriptions \"in unknown characters\" have been found in Bun\u0113r territory. Several of the stones bearing such inscriptions, being of small size, have been removed by Major Deane's agents and deposited in the Lahore Museum. Others known as yet only from impressions, may be supposed to be still in their original localities. Three of the places where impressions had been taken, could actually be reached by me.\n\nAt Tursak where an impression had been obtained of an inscribed stone walled into a Mulla's house, almost the whole population had fled at the approach of the troops. No local information was thus available as to which of the twelve Mulla's houses contained this epigraphical relic, and the prolonged search made by myself and my people failed to bring to light the desired stone from the mud-plastered walls of the deserted dwellings. At Nauakili and Mull\u0101sap, two villages towards the Malandri Pass, which I visited from one of the last camps by a forced march of over 25 miles, the result was equally disappointing. The few villagers who had not taken to the mountains, could or, would not show the position of the stones. Considering the combined fanaticism and ignorance of the population, it can scarcely surprise that information of this kind which might be supposed to lead to the discovery of hidden treasures, etc., was withheld from one of the invaders. The limited time available and the smallness of my escort\nmade at the same time a thorough search of the neighbourhood quite impracticable. At neither of the two localities could I trace any ancient ruins overground.\n\nI cannot conclude this brief account of my visit to Bunser without referring to the very great consideration which all the military authorities from General Sir Bindon Blood, the commander of the force, downwards have shown for my work. On no occasion did I apply to them in vain for needful assistance and personally I doubt whether a civilian on a similar mission could ever have met with a kindlier reception than that which was accorded to me among the officers of the Bunser Field Force. I feel particularly grateful to General Meiklejohn, Commanding the First Brigade, and his staff for the free scope they allowed for my movements. Nor shall I forget the excellent marching power of the escort furnished to me by his old regiment, the 20th Panjab Infantry, which enabled me to make full use of the freedom thus allowed to me.\n\nI intend to complete here at Mardan, in the centre of the old Gandhara my detailed report before I return to Lahore and the cares of the University office.\n\n7. Note on the date of the composition of the Kavitta Ramayana of Tulsi Das.\u2014By G. A. Grierson, C.I.E., Ph.D., I.C.S.\n\nAny fact which helps us to fix the date of the writings of Tulasi Dasa is of importance to the history of Indian Literature.\n\nThe Kavitta Ramayana of this poet is a collection of Kavittas written at different times. On page 97 of Vol. XXIII (1893) of the Indian Antiquary, I was able to show, from astronomical calculations, that the 171st Kavitta of the Uttara Kanda was written between 1612 and 1614 A.D.\n\nKavittas 163 to 177 are usually considered as forming a group by themselves referring to the plague which invaded India in the reign of Jahangir.\n\nIn Kavittas 163\u2013166, the poet addresses Civa, interceding on behalf of Benares, which is suffering from a terrible calamity, the people dying, as if from poison. In Nos. 167 and 168, he addresses Parvati in the same strain, and in both, he distinctly mentions the plague (mahamarta). In 169, he addresses Hanuman, and again mentions the plague. In 170 he addresses Hanuman and Ramacandra and again mentions the plague by name. In 171\u2013173, he addresses Ramacandra alone. In 171, he does not mention the plague. He refers to the oppressions which Benares is suffering from the Musalmans. The astronomical reference in this Kavitta enables us, as I have shown elsewhere, to fix the date of its writing, as between 1612 and 1614 A.D.\nIn 172, he simply adores the name of R\u0101ma, and in 173, he describes a terrible mortality which is occurring in the holy city. No. 174 admittedly has nothing to do with the plague. It is a kavitta in praise of a falcon. In No. 175, he entreats Hanum\u0101n and R\u0101macandra to save the city from an epidemic. In 176 he entreats R\u0101macandra to save the city from calamities under which it is suffering.\n\nFinally, in 177 he describes how the city had been punished for its sins by an epidemic of plague, and how it had been saved by R\u0101macandra in answer to the Poet's prayers.\n\nRegarding this plague, I here give the following extract from the Times' Weekly Edition for January 28th, 1898:\n\nHow important these improvements in treatment are may be learned from the records of an outbreak which took place at Agra in the year of the reign of the Mughal Emperor Jah\u0101ng\u012br (1605\u20131627). Its origin is narrated in the Emperor's autobiography as \"a strange and wonderful tale,\" of which, however, his Majesty, after direct inquiry, vouches for the truth. The daughter of a family that had fallen victims to the plague saw one day in the courtyard \"a mouse falling and rising in a distracted state. It was running about in every direction after the manner of drunkards and did not know where to go.\" A cat to which it was thrown nearly died, and soon afterwards the plague or bubo appeared in one of the female slaves and spread through the household, killing 17 people in the space of eight or nine days. The correspondence of this story with the supposed propagation of the plague in Bombay by infected rats brought in ships from China is significant. But even more striking is a preceding passage in the Royal autobiography, translated by Mr. Alexander Rogers for the Indian Magazine of the present month of January, 1898:\n\nAt this time those who were loyal represented that the disease of the plague (f\u0101'\u016bn) was prevalent in the city of Agra, so that in a day 100 people, more or less, were dying of it. Under the armpits, or in the groin, or below the throat a lump comes and they die. This is the third year that it has raged in the cold weather and disappeared in the commencement of the hot season. It is a strange thing that in these three years the infection has spread to all the towns and villages in the neighbourhood of Agra, and there has been no trace of it in the Fathpur Sikri, and as far as for 2\u00bd k\u014ds from Aman\u0101b\u0101d to Fathpur. The people of that place have forsaken their own homes and gone to other villages.\n\nSo great was the terror of infection that those stricken were left to their fate, \"and at last it came to such a pass that through excessive suspicion no one would come near them.\" If the origin of the disease\nseems to present a resemblance, the difference in the treatment of the sufferers is more apparent. In both cases the popular instinct hit upon the precaution of segregation. But under the Mughal empire the segregation was effected by abandoning the victims; in our day it is in some measure secured by carrying off the victims to hospitals, where they receive the utmost alleviation that their malady permits and the best chance of recovery.\n\nI have no materials at hand to check the dates given in this extract, but we may assume that the plague was at its height in Agra in the year 1618 A.D. We have thus a terminus before which the kavittas referring to the plague cannot have been written. We are also able to assert that the 171st kavitta cannot refer to the plague, as is generally supposed by native scholars, for it is written at least four years before A.D. 1618.\n\nThere is no reason to suppose that the kavittas were arranged in their present order by the poet himself. Even if they were, it is plain from the analysis given above that he did not group them rigorously according to subjects. We have the kavitta in praise of the falcon inserted amongst a number referring to the plague. I may note that this kavitta, in praise of the auspicious bird, is said to have been uttered by the poet when at the point of death. The bird flew across his vision, and he accepted it as a good omen.\n\nNote:\u2014The passage referring to the Plague is taken from the Fuzak-i-Jahangiri (Sayyid Ahmad's edition, page 259). More references may be found in Elliot-Dowson's, Vol. VI, pages 346, 357, 405. The Plague first appeared in the Panjab in the eleventh year of Jahangir's reign (commenced 10th March 1616), or rather in the middle of the preceding year. When the Emperor came to Agra in the thirteenth year of his reign (=A.D. 1618), he found the plague at its height, and in connection with this the stories of the mouse and female slave, etc., are related. The plague is said to have lasted for 8 years.\u2014T.B.\n\n8. Human Sacrifices in Ancient Assam.\u2014By E. A.

F. R. Hoernle, C.I.E. Plates I-II.\n\nIn my Presidential Address, published in the Proceedings for February last (page 68), I mentioned that I had in my possession twenty-one volumes, which had come from Khotan, in Chinese Turkestan. There is one point with regard to these volumes that I omitted to state, which I will now supply. They are not all manuscript books as it might appear from the connection in which I spoke of them. Some of them are block-prints. I had noticed this circumstance long ago, as well as two others, that the block-printed matter repeated itself on every page of the books, and that it was printed in different positions on their alternative pages. As this is a point of considerable interest, the notice of which I had unfortunately missed out in my Address, I will now enter into it a little more fully.\n\nMost of the twenty-one volumes are certainly manuscripts. With regard to some I am not certain what they are, manuscript or block-print; but there are others which are undoubtedly block-prints. For on many pages the smudges of the square straight-lined margins of the blocks can be distinctly seen. Occasionally the block was provided with a square of raised straight lines enclosing the type, and this marginal square is printed off along with the enclosed type.\n\nThe printing was not always carefully done, occasionally the blocks were inked too much, and the prints are smudgy; at other times they were inked too little, and the print is almost illegible. When the print\n| Block Type | Fig. 1 |\n|------------|--------|\n| 1          |        |\n| 2          |        |\n| 3          |        |\n| 4          |        |\n| 5          |        |\n| 6          |        |\n| 7          |        |\n| 8          |        |\n| 9          |        |\n| 10         |        |\n| 11         |        |\n| 12         |        |\n\nCol.

One of them shows a text arranged in two columns, the other has a text in three columns, of which, however, two are identical with those of the first variety. The two varieties of text are shown in figures 1 and 2 of Plate I. To the first variety belong three of the five block-prints described in this Note; and one of these three forms a sub-variety, as will be shown below. In printing these books, accordingly, at least two distinct blocks must have been used; but the types cut on the two blocks exhibit a very striking similarity, as if one were copied from the other, so far as the identical portions of the text are concerned. The various modes in which the prints were taken from these two blocks will be explained under the description of each book.\n\n(1) Block-print a. This was received by me from Captain Stuart H. Godfrey, along with two other volumes, on the 25th February last. It is, therefore, not included among the \"twenty-one volumes\" mentioned in my Address. Its pages measure $8 \\times 10\\frac{1}{4}$ inches. It consists of 32 \"forms\"; each form is made up of one sheet of paper, which is folded in the middle, thus making two leaves. Each form, accordingly, consists of two leaves, or four pages. The book is provided with two covers, each made up of four layers of paper pasted together to make a thick paste-board. The forms are stitched together, to make up a book, along the longer side of the leaves. The stitches are made with copper nails, held in position by small thin copper plates, attached to the two ends of the nails.\n\nThe block of type (Plate I, fig. 1) which is printed on the pages of this book measures, between the edging lines, nearly $3\\frac{1}{4} \\times 6\\frac{1}{4}$ inches. Each page bears three impressions of it, placed side by side, parallel to the longer side of the page, and so that the head of the block is always turned to the outer edge of the page. The latter circumstance makes it necessary to turn round the book entirely, when, in reading, one passes from one page to the next following, though, of course, owing to the constant repetition of the same text, there was no need, in reading, to observe any particular order of the pages. On the right and left of each page there is left a blank margin of about one inch on either side. This reduces the space on the page to about $8\\frac{1}{4}$ inches; and as three impressions of the block had to be accommodated within that space, they were placed so close together that the co-terminous edges of their type almost touch one another. To admit of this close printing, the enclosing straight lines had to be left uninked; and the edging lines of the block, therefore, (excepting occasional smudges) are not seen on the pages.\nOnly two pages, towards the middle of the book, make an exception to this arrangement. On these the impressions are placed the other way, parallel to the narrower side of the page. In this way only two impressions could be accommodated side by side; for these there was plenty of room; and accordingly the edging lines of the block were inked, and are seen on the page. On the other hand, with this arrangement there was not space on the page enough for four impressions; the space was too much for two, and too little for four impressions. Hence the other alternative was adopted of accommodating only three impressions on each page, by arranging them differently, and thus utilising the whole of the available space on the page. It seems natural to conclude that those two exceptional pages were the first trial pages. They form together the outer side of a folded sheet. The modus operandi seems to have been, to take a sheet, and fold it in the middle; then unfold it and place on it as many impressions as the two halves of it would take; then, after printing, to fold it again; and finally to bind the folded sheets into a book.\n\n(2) Block-print \u03b2. This book was received by me in October last, together with 13 others, from Mr. G. Macartney. Its pages measure $5 \\times 6\\frac{1}{4}$ inches; and it consists of 35 forms, each made (as before explained) of one folded sheet, there being altogether 70 leaves. It has no special covers; only the two outside leaves are not imprinted. It is stitched with three copper nails, which are held in position by two copper slips, one in front and the other at the back of the book, along its longer side. These slips measure $6 \\times \\frac{3}{8}$ inches.\n\nEach page bears one impression of the block (Plate I, fig. 1). The edging lines of the block are not shown, excepting occasional smudges. The impression of the type just fills the whole page, leaving only narrow margins on all four sides. The block must have been badly inked; for the impressions are only faintly visible. Column I, line 7, letter l exhibits a different reading; see pages 128 and 130.\n\n(3) Block-print \u03b3. This is also one of the thirteen books received from Mr. Macartney in October last. Its pages measure $11\\frac{1}{2} \\times 4\\frac{1}{4}$ inches, and it consists of 40 forms, each made up of one folded sheet. It has no special cover: of the two terminal leaves, one is not imprinted at all, while the other is only imprinted on the inner side. It is stitched, in three places, along its longer side, with twists of paper. Each of these three twists is passed through two adjacent holes and tied into a knot.\n\nEach page bears one full impression, and the major portion of another. Of the latter, the two first lines are wanting, for which the page afforded no space. The two impressions are placed so as to turn their heads to the edges of the page; their foot-lines (line 12 in fig. 1) accordingly meet in the middle of the page.\nA curiosity of this book is that it shows a few letters, apparently written in an altogether different script, inscribed in the middle of the blank space, which separates line 7 from line 8 of the text. See Plate I, fig. 3. They cannot have been, of course, on the block of the text; they might have been imprinted from separate small blocks; but they rather look as if they were inscribed by hand. They are shown on Plate II, in facsimile, and occur at irregular places in the book, as follows:\n\n| Nos. | Sheet. | Leaf. | Page. | Nos. | Sheet. | Leaf. | Page. |\n|------|--------|-------|-------|------|--------|-------|-------|\n| (1)  | 1      | 2     | 4     | (22, 23) | 19    | 37, 38 | 73, 76 |\n| (2, 3) | 3     | 5, 6  | 9, 12 | (24, 25) | 20    | 39, 40 | 77, 80 |\n| (4, 5) | 5     | 9, 10 | 17, 20 | (26, 27) | 21    | 41, 42 | 81, 84 |\n| (6, 7) | 6     | 11, 12 | 21, 24 | (28, 29) | 26    | 51, 52 | 101, 104 |\n| (8, 9) | 7     | 13, 14 | 25, 28 | (30, 31) | 27    | 53, 54 | 105, 108 |\n| (10, 11) | 11   | 21, 22 | 41, 44 | (32, 33) | 28    | 55, 56 | 109, 112 |\n| (12, 13) | 12   | 23, 24 | 45, 48 | (34, 35) | 30    | 59, 60 | 117, 120 |\n| (14, 15) | 15   | 29, 30 | 57, 60 | (36, 37) | 31    | 61, 62 | 121, 124 |\n| (16, 17) | 16   | 31, 32 | 61, 64 | (38, 39) | 32    | 63, 64 | 125, 128 |\n| (18, 19) | 17   | 33, 34 | 65, 68 | (40, 41) | 36    | 71, 72 | 141, 144 |\n| (20, 21) | 18   | 35, 36 | 69, 72 |\n\nOn each of the pages, above enumerated, two of these additional inscriptions occur. For each page has two impressions of the block and, therefore, two intermediate blank spaces. It will also be seen, from the numbering of the pages, that if a \"form\" is unfolded into an open sheet, the additional inscriptions all show on the same side of the sheet. Thus the \"form\" or sheet 3 folds into the leaves 5 and 6; then, the outer pages (or the obverse of the sheet) number 9 and 12; while the inner pages (or the reverse of the sheet) number 10 and 11. Here the additional inscriptions stand on the obverse side, on pages 9 and 12, while there are no additional inscriptions on the reverse side of the sheet, i.e., on pages 10 and 11. Accordingly, the obverse side of the sheet bears four additional inscriptions, i.e., two on each page. These additional inscriptions consist of 4 or 5 or 6 letters.\n\n(4) Block-print \u03b4. This is again one of the 13 books received from Mr. Macartney in October last. Its pages measure $5\\frac{1}{2} \\times 7\\frac{1}{2}$ inches, and it consists of 37 forms, each made up of one folded sheet. It has no special cover; the first and last leaves are blank; so is the first page of the second leaf, and the second page of the penultimate leaf. It is stitched in three places, along the longer side, by means of three copper nails fixed with small copper plates, exactly like block-print \u03b1. The printing is not very well done, the cause apparently being the rather indifferent quality of the ink.\nEach page bears one impression of the block. With the exception of a few pages the edging lines of the block-type are not shown. There is a blank margin round the type, on all four sides of a page, about an inch, or an inch and a quarter, wide.\n\nThe impressions in this book were taken from a different block, which is shown in Plate I, figure 2. It differs from the block used in the books previously described, by having a third column of text inserted in the vertical blank space, and an additional line of text inserted in the horizontal blank space between lines 7 and 8. The text also agrees with that of book \u03b2, in exhibiting the same varia lectio in column I, line 7, letter 1, see pages 126 and 130.\n\n(5) Block-print \u03b5. Again one of the thirteen books, received from Mr. Macartney, in October last. Its pages measure $4\\frac{1}{4} \\times 9\\frac{1}{4}$ inches; and it consists of 33 forms, of one folded sheet each. In point of cover, stitching and printing it is exactly like block-print \u03b4.\n\nThe block used in printing this book was the same as that for printing book \u03b4. The text, accordingly, also possesses the additional column and line.\n\nEach page bears one full impression of the block and the minor portion (lines 8 to 12) of another, inclusive of the additional line. In this case the two impressions are not placed, as in book \u03b3, with their foot-lines adjoining, but in regular order. The full impression stands at the bottom of the page; and above it, is placed the mutilated impression, with its additional line, so that the whole page commences with the latter line.\n\nAll the five books, above described, are printed on paper of a coarse quality and a dirty, darkish buff colour. Dr. D. Prain, the Superintendent of the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sibpur, who has kindly examined it for me, says that it is of the same kind as the ordinary Nepalese paper, made of the fibres of the Daphne plant. The colour of this paper is yellow, but darkens with age.\n\nThe edges of the books are not cut, but frayed.\n\nThere is nothing to distinguish the beginning and end of a book; and the pages are not numbered. Nor am I certain what is the top and what the bottom of a page. The figures on Plate I show what I take to be the top and the bottom. I have been guided in this arrangement by the curious resemblance of some of the letters to Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi.\n\nThere are evidently two versions of the text, a simpler and a fuller. The former is shown in figure 1; the latter in figure 2. In the fuller text the vertical blank space between the two columns of the simpler text is filled up with additional writing, making up, in fact, a third column, and the horizontal blank space is also filled up with an additional line.\nThe insertion of the additional column would seem to indicate that each column of the simpler text must be read by itself, the third column forming an additional text. The horizontal blank space, dividing the column into halves of seven and five lines respectively, would seem to show that each column consists of two formulae. The simpler and fuller texts would thus contain four and six formulae respectively. Of course, they might be connected with one another.\n\nThe text, to judge from its repetitions, would seem to be some formula, perhaps a charm or an invocation or a so-called \"creed.\" The repetitions seems to suggest a system of praying like that of the Tibetans with their prayer-wheels or flags. The Khotan devotee may similarly have sent up a long string of prayers by simply turning the leaves of his book as rapidly as possible.\n\nI have already remarked on the resemblance of some of the signs to letters of the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi alphabet. Accordingly I suspect that the lines are to be read from the right to the left, and that the letters belong to the Semitic class of alphabets. It will be noticed that the letters are written in different sizes, apparently only for the purpose of utilising the available space to the fullest extent. Here and there the forms of the letters in the two texts do not fully coincide. This seems to be due to imperfect inking of the block, or to inequalities in the execution of the block. What the correct form of the letter may be must remain, for the present, uncertain.\n\nIn the following references the letters of the three columns are counted separately, and, in each column, from the right to left.\n\nCol. II, line 10, letter 4 (the last) resembles the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi letter khu. The same letter (kha) occurs in col. II, line 3, letter 2.\n\nCol. I, line 2, letter 5, resembles the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi da. It is also written diminutively. It also occurs in col. II, line 4, letter 3; col. II, line 12, letter 3; and col. I, line 8, letter 5 (du).\n\nCol. I, line 4, letter 1 resembles the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi ya. It also occurs in col. I, line 3, letter 1 (y\u0101); col. III, line 8, letter 1; col. II, line 3, letter 4.\n\nCol. I, line 4, letter 3 resembles the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi m\u014d; the bottom of the letter is open owing to imperfect inking of the type. The same letter occurs in col. II, line 12, letter 4 (ma), and in col. III, line 5, letter 3 (ma\u1e41).\n\nCol. II, line 4, letter 1 resembles the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi na. It also occurs in col. III, line 6, letter 2, and col. I, add. line, letter 3.\n\nCol. II, line 9, letter 1 resembles Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi tra. It also occurs in col. III, line 6, letter 3.\n\nCol. II, line 9, letter 4 resembles the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi ba; and in diminutive form, it occurs in col. III, line 11, letter 4.\nCol. I, add. line, letter 4 resembles the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi va; so also col. I, line 10, letter 4; also col. I, line 5, letter 4 (vu), and col. II, line 7, letter 2 (vu); col. I, line 11, letter 4 (vu); also col. II, line 9, letter 3 (va).\n\nCol. III, line 11, letter 1 resembles Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi ra or ta. It occurs also in col. II, line 8, letter 2, and, in diminutive size, in col. II, line 3, letter 3.\n\nCol. I, line 1, letter 3 resembles the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi \u00e7a; and in col. I, line 4, letter 4 there is \u00e7a.\n\nCol. I, add. line, letter 6 resembles the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi sa (or s\u014d).\n\nCol. II, line 8, letter 5 resembles the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi dha. With the preceding letter, the word might be budha (buddha).\n\nCol. III, line 1, letter 3 resembles the Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dhi am.\n\nA letter which occurs several times is in col. II, line 2, letter 3; col. II, line 4, letter 4; col. II, line 5, letter 1; col. I, add. line, letter 5; col. I, line 2, letter 3.\n\nCol. I, line 6, letter 4 has some resemblance to the Greek capital A, and col. I, line 6, letter 3, col. II, line 7, letter 3, col. III, line 12, letter 1 to the Greek capital U (V); and col. III, line 7, letter 4 is exactly like the obsolete Greek \u03c1 of the Kanerki coins. It also occurs in col. I, line 7, letter 1, where, however, the loop is omitted in the simpler text. There are also some other signs which remind one of Greek letters, thus omega in col. II, line 11, letter 4; omikron in col. II, line 2, letter 2, and elsewhere; sigma in col. I, line 4, letter 2; col. I, line 12, letter 2; col. I, line 11, letter 2 (or 3). Another sign, like sigma reversed, occurs in col. I, line 8, letter 4; and with a side-stroke, in col. I, line 2, letter 7; col. III, line 2, letter 1; col. II, line 4, letter 2. Iota occurs in col. I, line 2, letter 2, and col. I, line 12, letter 1.\n\nWith reference to the facsimile legends shown on Plate II, I should explain, that they are shown on a uniform plan: their heads point to line 7, and their foot to line 8, as shown in figure 3 of Plate I. It will be noticed, however, that the same symbol often occurs in reversed positions, which seems to suggest that occasionally the legend is turned on its head.\n\nIn each numbered group, there are shown two legends, marked a and b. These occur on the same page of the book; thus a and b of No. 1 occur on page 4. Each page, as already explained, bears two imprints of the block (fig. 1, Plate I). Each imprint, of course has the horizontal blank space; and in these two blank spaces the two legends a and b are placed.\n\nIt will be noticed that the same letter or group of letters is often repeated. I cannot yet identify them; but some of them suggest Greek\nGeorgian, or Cyrillic forms. I quote below a few of the most striking examples.\n\n**Single letters.**\n\n1. \u0415 Nos. 18a, b, 20b, 37b (Cyrillic \u0435).\n2. \u0417 Nos. 8a, 9b, 11b, 13b, 19ab, 20a, 25b, 31b, 38b, 39b, 40b; (Cyrillic \u0437).\n3. \u039a Nos. 2a, 12a (Greek or Cyrillic \u043a).\n4. \u0397 Nos. 14a, 36a, 41a.\n5. \u03a3 Nos. 11a, 12b, 15a (Georgian q or Russian \u0442\u0441\u0447).\n6. \u03a0 Nos. 6a, 10a, 27b, 34a.\n7. \u0399 Nos. 1b, 5a, 13a, 26a, 28b, 33a, 37a.\n8. \u0398 No. 6a (Georgian \u043d).\n9. \u03a9 Nos. 11b, 15a.\n10. \u03a1 No. 14a.\n11. \u039f No. 30b (Georgian \u043c).\n12. \u0391 No. 13a.\n13. \u03a1 No. 18b (Greek \u03c1).\n14. \u03a6 Nos. 18b, 22b, 29b, 34a, 38b (Georgian, Cyrillic \u0444).\n15. \u03a6 Nos. 27a, 32a (Georgian \u043f).\n\n**Groups of letters.**\n\n16. \u0395\u0417 Nos. 2b, 8b, 36a (cf.

Note on Dr. Hoernle's paper on New and Rare Hindu and Muhammadan Coins, No. IV.\u2014By O. Codrington, M.D., F.S.A. Communicated by the Philological Secretary.\n\nNo. 15, plate VI, 1897, is a well-known Hindu coin. Marsden figured it No. LXVIII in Numismata Orientalia and correctly read the legend.\n\nThe coins are known in Western Indian bazars as Chatrapati or Satara pice, are found commonly in almost any collection of copper coins met with in the Konkan or Western Dekkan, and are said, I think quite rightly, to be the coins of the Satara State founded by \u010civ\u0101ji. Two varieties are recognized and called the old and new paisa. The one figured by Marsden is one of the former sort, the lettering on the latter sort is bolder and the coins are larger. The legend which as usual is seldom or never complete on any one specimen is\u2014\n\nObv. \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 Rev. \u0915\u091a\n\u0930\u093e\u091c\u093e \u092a\u0924\u093f\n\u091a\u093f\u0935\n\nIt does not vary on any of the older sort, but on some of the newer the last line of the Obv. is a little different. I have seen one which reads \u091a\u093f\u0935. The older are, I think, coins of \u010cambh\u0101ji Chatrapati (A.D. 1681\u201388) son of \u010civ\u0101ji, if not of that great man himself, the newer may be attributed to \u010civ\u0101ji \u010cah\u016b, the third ruler (A.D. 1708\u201349) and his successors, the coin having the last line \u0930\u093e\u091c being possibly one of R\u0101m R\u0101ja the fourth king (1750\u201377).\n\nA large number of the official Seals of the Satara kings and their ministers were deposited in the Museum of the Bombay Asiatic Society in 1875 by order of Government, of which I gave a full description in Vol. XVI, of that Society's Journal after having made a good deal of search and enquiry at the Alienation Daftar at Poona where a large collection of documents connected with the Satara State is stored. On these seals the name of \u010civ\u0101ji is always \u091a\u093f\u0935 not \u091a\u093f\u0935\u093e\u091c\u0940; the title Chatrapati is on many of them, and the dynasty is commonly spoken of as the Chatrapati Rajas.\n\nH. H. Wilson, Grant Duff and the Bombay Gazetteer all state that \u010civ\u0101ji struck silver coins, Wilson adding that in all probability the larin was the form adopted by him, for that was the chief silver currency\nin the Konkan and Western Dekkan in his time. I have been on the look out for years for any silver piece which might be attributed to \u010civ\u0101ji without any success. All larins I have seen bear some Persian legend, \u010civ\u0101ji would not have tolerated that I think.\n\nNo. 13 in the same plate is a coin of the Porbandar State, known in the bazars as rana shai. In my paper on the Coinages of Cutch and Kathiawar, published in the Numismatic Chronicle for 1895, Vol. XV, I described the coins of the Muzaffar Sh\u0101h of Gujarat pattern issued in those States of which this is one.\n\n5.

Rodgers' \"Catalogue of the Coins in the Indian Museum,\" Part II (1894), pp. 200, 201, it will be seen that the coins of the Patiy\u0101l\u0101h State bear the following curious inscription:\n\n\\[ \\text{\u062d\u06a9\u0645 \u0634\u062f \u0627\u0632 \u0642\u0627\u062f\u0631 \u0646\u06cc\u0686\u0631\u06cc\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u062d\u06cc\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u062f\u0634\u0627\u06c1} \\]\n\\[ \\text{\u0633\u06a9\u0647 \u0632\u062f \u0628\u0631\u0633\u0645 \u0648\u0631\u0632 \u0627\u0648\u062c \u0645\u0627\u0647\u06cc \u062a\u06cc\u0627 \u0628\u06cc\u0627} \\]\n\nIt is the same as that borne by the coins of Ahmad Sh\u0101h Durr\u0101ni, see the same work, Part IV (1896), p. 165. I do not know that anyone has ever called attention to the curious fact that a Sikh should adopt and retain a motto from the coins of one of the hated Mahomedans. The point is not referred to either in J. D. Cunningham's \"History of the Sikhs\" or in Sir Lepel Griffin's \"Panjab Rajas.\" The following account is to be found on folio 54 a, b, of the work Husain Shahi (British Museum, Ms. Oriental, No. 1662), composed in the year 1213 H. (1798) by Mu'inu-d-din, Cishti. The occasion referred to must have been after 1176 H. (1761-2) and before 1770, the year of Najib Kh\u0101n's death; Cunningham and Griffin attribute this last invasion to the year 1767. If this chronicler is to be relied on, then Mr. Rodgers will have to assign the coin No. 11,119 (p. 200) to Amr Singh instead of to Alah Singh, his grandfather. According to Mu'inu-d-din L\u0101hori's Tarikh-i-Panj\u0101b, R\u0101jah Amr Singh succeeded his grandfather in 1764 and died in 1780.\n\nThese men were not particularly well pleased at the Durr\u0101ni King's reappearance to disturb them in their ease. Most of them sent presents and humble petitions full of frivolous excuses for non-attendance. Najibu-d-daulah was the only one that put in an appearance, and he reported that in Hind\u016bst\u0101n all was peace and His Majesty might return\nto Qandahar and there take his rest and repose. Meanwhile the government of Sihirind was made over to Najibu-d-daulah and he took possession of its castle.\n\nNow Amr Singh was the grandson of Alah Singh Jat, the first of the Sikhs who rose to power. One day Najibu-d-daulah said to Amr Singh, \"Rajah! This foot of yours, Patiyalash, is nothing, I will show you a much better one, Shergah, which I have made at Najibabad, it is very strong.\" Amr Singh inferred that it was intended to send him as a prisoner to Najibabad; his heart sunk, and the colour left his face. But Fato, widow of Alah Singh and grandmother of Amr Singh, was a clever woman. She went secretly and fell at the feet of Shah Wali Khan (Ahmad Shah's chief minister), placed her shawl on his feet, and bare-headed petitioned that for God's sake he would rescue her grandson from the claws of Najibu-d-daulah, promising to present a fitting tribute (nazarana). Shah Wali Khan was a man of probity and of very kindly disposition, and during the night at a private interview made some statement to the king.\n\nIn the morning the king sent for Amr Singh from the encampment of Najibu-d-daulah, gave him a robe of honour, and conferred on him the title of Raja-i-Rajagun, which is held by his descendants to this day. And the coinage of Ahmad Shah, shelter of the faith (Dinpanah), is current in Patiyalash; and whoever sits in the throne of that territory issues his coin in the name of that exalted king (i.e., Ahmad Shah), and announces himself as a servant of that exalted house. Amr Singh caused the words Raja-i-Manizai to be engraved on his signet ring, Ahmad Shah being a Manizai. In return for the kindness of Shah Wali Khan, Amr Singh counted himself a servant of Ahmad Shah.\n\n7. On a third invasion of India by Baer's Pochard (Nyroca baeri.)\u2014By F. Finn, B.A., F.Z.S., Deputy Superintendent of the Indian Museum (with exhibition of specimens.)\n\n[Received and Read April 6th, 1898.]\n\nIn the Society's Proceedings for 1896 (p. 61), and in the Journal for 1897 (Pt. II, p. 525), I have already recorded two incursions into India on the part of the East-Asiatic duck mentioned in the title of this paper.\n\nI have now to communicate the fact that Nyroca baeri has again visited India, during the past cold season, in numbers, which, if they do not compare with those recorded on the last occasion (see Journal, loc. cit.), at any rate show that the bird was not at all uncommon. The two specimens exhibited to-night form part of a series of seven secured\nfor the Museum collection, while twelve living birds were purchased for the Alipore Zoological Gardens, whence some have been despatched to the London Zoological Society; and in addition to these I saw others which I did not buy. In fact, taking into consideration the rather poor supply of water-fowl in the Calcutta Provision Bazaar this winter, Nyroca baeri might have been fairly called a common duck there.\n\nI saw the first specimen in the Bazaar on November 8th, 1897, and the last on March 23rd of the present year, so that the species has been present for some time; longer, apparently, than before, the latest date on which I have previously recorded it being February 27th. Among the specimens I observed there were very few males, and none of these were in full-plumage, all being immature. Of the nineteen specimens above recorded as obtained for the Museum and Zoological Gardens, only six were drakes, and I do not remember seeing any others among those which I did not buy. Among the females also, few or none were in full-plumage, (though I only saw a very few in the complete brown plumage of immaturity) so that these also were apparently nearly all young birds.\n\nIn one of the females procured for the Alipore Zoological Gardens, however, I observed that the iris was almost as white as a male's, so that this at any rate was probably an old bird, if the colour of the eye in the female of this species becomes lighter with age. Certainly brown is the usual colour of the iris in those females of this species I have seen so far, though I have noted exceptions.\n\nIt is curious that even yet no sportsman appears to have met with this species;* probably the fact that most of the birds do not strikingly show the characteristics of the species accounts for this; though I find that the market dealers can distinguish them from the common white-eye (Nyroca africana). The full-plumaged male is, of course, quite unmistakable, but appears to be rare here. One female I saw, but did not buy, had a large white patch at the base of the throat in front, in addition to the usual spot at the base of the beak beneath.\n\nWith regard to the habits of the species, I may add to what I have previously recorded that the note of the female is a harsh \"karr,\" and that she sometimes jerks back her neck much like the male.\n\n8.

An Epigraphical Note on Palm-leaf, Paper and Birch-bark.\u2014By A. F. Rudolf Hoernle, C.I.E., Ph.D.\n\nThe paper will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\n2. On some imperfectly known points in the Habits and Economy of Birds, No. II. On the Use of the Feet for Prehension by certain Passerine Birds, especially Babblers.\u2014By F. Finn, B.A., F.Z.S., Deputy Superintendent of the Indian Museum.\n\nConsidering the perfect organization of the feet of Passerine birds for grasping, it is somewhat astonishing that so many of them appear to have no notion of using these members for holding their food, or for transporting any object after the manner of Birds of Prey.\n\nIt would appear, however, that our common Crow (Corvus splendens) does occasionally do the latter, for I have on two or three occasions seen one flying with a stick or other nesting material in its foot, thus imitating a Kite.\nCuriously enough, Kites themselves frequently carry nesting material in their beaks, though food is carried by them in the feet.\n\nAmong Passerine birds other than Crows, I have seen a Brown Shrike (Lanius cristatus) in the Museum compound, carry off in its foot a dragon-fly on which it was preying when disturbed; and a King-crow (Dicrurus ater) in a large compartment in one of the aviaries of the Alipore Zoological Gardens similarly transported a butterfly I had given it, when persecuted by other birds which wanted the insect. I have also noticed that Bhimrajs (Dissemurus paradiseus) which I have kept, when disturbed with food in their foot, will still thus retain it when shifting their position.\n\nThis habit of grasping the food in one foot is just as characteristic of the Drongos as of the true Shrikes, judging from what I have seen of Dissemurus paradiseus and Dicrurus ater; I have even seen the latter bird apparently trying to eat something from its feet in the air. Ohibia hottenotota appears also to grasp its food with its foot when feeding, at times. I have distinctly seen recently a Piping-crow (Gymnorhina) both grasp its food with its feet like a Shrike and put it under one foot like a Crow, in quick succession.\n\nThe habit of using the foot as a hand (with the leg resting on the ground or perch) would thus seem to be common to various Shrike-like birds; but it is rather surprising to find it markedly characteristic of many of the Babblers, as I have done after studying many species in captivity.*\n\nIn the case of Cratervopus canorus, Argya earlii, Garrulax leucolophus and albigularis, Pyctorhis sinensis, Lioptila capistrata, Siva cyanuroptera, Liothrix luteus, Mesia argentaursis, and Egithina tiphia, this action was to be remarked, though some of these birds, at all events, frequently employ the corvine method of putting the food under the foot simply, and this was specially the case with Pyctorhis. Trochalopterum lineatum and a species of Zoeterops I kept very seldom used their feet in feeding and Ianthocinclla rufigularis and Pomatorhinus erythrogenys apparently not at all, though I thought I saw a sign of this in the last species.\n\nNone of the various species of Bulbuls, however, which I have kept from time to time, have ever shown any disposition to use their feet in feeding, and in this respect Chloropsis also agrees with them rather than with its obviously nearer relative Egithina.\n\nMyiophonus temminckii, the only member of the Brachypteryginae\n\n* Blyth, however, as quoted by Jerdon (Birds of India, vol. IV., pt. I., pp. 16 and 36,) has recorded the use of the foot in feeding by Pyctorhis sinensis and Dryonastes sinensis. I have alluded to the habit in some of these birds in my papers on the Theory of Warning Coloration and Mimicry, J. A. S. B., 1895 and 1897.\nwhich I have been able to examine in this regard, does not seem inclined to use its foot; as indeed one would not expect it to do, seeing its manifestly close relationship to the typical Thrushes, Merula and Turdus, which in its gait and appearance it so much resembles. For the Babblers, when on the ground, generally move with a quite different action from the true Thrushes, standing less erect and progressing by more or less bounding hops only, without running as a rule. But Argya earlii appears to be more Thrush-like in its gait than other Babblers, though typical enough in most respects. The New Zealand Thrush (Turnagra) though somewhat resembling a Babbler in gait and tail action, does not, according to the testimony of the keeper of the Western Aviary at the London Zoological Gardens, who watched it for me, use its foot in feeding.\n\nThese differences between Babblers and Thrushes may seem very trivial matters to insist upon, but it must be remembered that the former group is generally admitted to be a very difficult one to define, and this habit of using the foot in feeding, like a Crow or a Shrike, will certainly differentiate most Babblers, large or small, from either Thrushes or Warblers, none of which, so far as I have seen, ever act in this way; and I have had opportunities of observing, besides other Thrushes and Warblers, Copsychus saularis, Citocincla macrura, and Orthotomus sutorius, under conditions which should have made them show this action, if it were habitual.\n\nThis distinction in habit is paralleled by the fact that the Troupials, as I have observed in the case of Icterus vulgaris, though simulating the Starlings in form and the Orioles in colour, differ from both these groups in readily making use of their feet when feeding, generally in corvine fashion.\n\nOf course, habits of this kind may vary in allied groups even; I do not remember seeing Sparrows (Passer domesticus and montanus) ever use their foot to retain any object, as some Finches, e.g., the Canary will do. And among Cuckoos, while the Crow-Pheasant (Centropus sinensis) uses its foot like a true Crow, the Guira (Guira guira) does not appear to do so, though a bird of similar habit in some respects. Nor do all Parrots even, characteristic as the gesture is, use their feet as hands; the Budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus), does not do so, as far as I know. I would not, therefore, press this character too hard. But a habit certainly does seem very persistent in many cases, and the present one should, I think, be allowed a certain amount of weight, in conjunction with other characters.\n\nCuriously enough, the typical Babblers are strikingly marked off from allied groups by other peculiarities only observable in the living\nbird. Thus, they are usually, from Garrulax to Zosterops, remarkably and demonstratively sociable, exhibiting an intense love of company, and being given to cuddling up to and caressing other birds, including those of another species, or even group, if the latter permit. Chloropsis, however, and apparently Egithina, is not thus disposed.\n\nThis social disposition, which, by the way, is less noticeable among Bulbuls, is obviously different from that of Thrushes and Warblers, and though a mental or moral character, should be allowed its due weight in considering the relationships of such difficult and closely-related groups as the Thrush-like Passeres.*\n\n3. A further note on Tulasi-d\u0101sa and the Plague in Benares.\u2014By G. A. Grierson, C.I.E., Ph.D., I.C.S.\n\nIn my Notes on Tulasi-d\u0101sa published on p. 253 of the Indian Antiquary for October, 1893. I referred to the Hanum\u0101n-b\u0101huka as an appendix to the Kavitta-r\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a written when the poet was suffering from a severe sore in the arm.\n\nA note by me on the date of the composition of the Kavitta-r\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a appeared in the Proceedings of the Society for last March. In it I mentioned the references made in that poem to the Plague which devastated Benares in the first half of the 17th century. A copy of this note was sent by me to Mah\u0101mahop\u0101dhyaya Pandit Sudh\u0101kara-dv\u012bvedi of Benares, and he now points out to me that it is most probable that the poet himself died of the disease, and that the Hanum\u0101n-b\u0101huka was composed by him while suffering from it. The following remarks are based on his communication.\n\nTulasi-d\u0101sa died in Sambat 1680, equivalent to 1623 A.D. The plague appeared in India in 1616 A.D., and lasted for eight years. It is therefore not impossible that the poet should have fallen a victim to the pestilence.\n\nOne of the most characteristic symptoms of the disease is the extremely painful boils or bubos, which commonly first appear in the groins or armpits. In the 25th verse of the Hanum\u0101n-b\u0101huka, the poet says in so many words that his sore is in his armpit, b\u0101hu-taru-m\u016bla, the root of the tree of his arm. In the 37th verse he tells how the pain cannot be borne by night or by day, and that it is in the arm which Hanumat had once grasped as a friend, i.e., in his right arm. In the last line of verse 35 he thanks Hanumat for having relieved his pain, in accordance with the prayers which he commenced in verse 30.\n\n* I may also mention, in this connection, that I found that being confined and watched in a cage, Egithina tiphia and Argya earlii did not produce \"castings\" from insects given, while Cittocinclla macrura did so.\nIn that verse he cries, 'Is it from my own sin, or from fate, or from some curse? I cannot tell, I cannot bear, the pangs I suffer in my arm. Drugs, charms, spells, simples, all are unavailing. I pray to God, and he only adds fuel to the fire. Who, in this universe, whether he be Creator, Preserver, Destroyer, Fate or Time, heedeth not thy commands, O Hanumat? Tulasi is thy slave. Claim him as thine. Thy delay addeth pangs upon his pangs.'\n\nIn the 36th and the following verses, the language of the poet becomes confused. His relief had been but temporary. He no longer calls only upon Hanumat. He commences a verse by addressing that deity, and finishes it with a prayer to R\u0101ma-candra. This confusion continues to the last or 44th verse. His disease increases in severity, and in the 41st verse, he tells us that his body is now covered all over with ghastly sores. This is borne out by a tradition that when the poet was at the point of death he became a leper. The sores of the plague are evidently referred to. Mah\u0101mahop\u0101dhy\u0101ya Sudh\u0101kara-dviv\u0113di adds that in his boyhood he used to hear from his father and from Vandana-P\u0101\u1e6dhaka, the great authority on Tulasi-d\u0101sa, that the poet had composed the Hanum\u0101n-b\u0101huka in four days, and from the data now before us it seems to be extremely probable that the verses were uttered by him on his deathbed, during the four days he was suffering from plague.\n\nThe only other possible explanation of the poem is the traditional one, that he was suffering from a carbuncle; but from all we know of the high character of this great man, it seems improbable that he should have used such vivid language regarding what, after all, was not an uncommon complaint, and which was a curable one. Moreover, if the poet had recovered from such a carbuncle, surely the poem would have concluded with some words of thankfulness to the deity whom he had been addressing in such impassioned language. Other works of Tulasi-d\u0101sa show that he was the reverse of an ungrateful man, and I am only able to account for the omission of thanks by supposing that he never did recover from the disease which he laments, that he really was suffering from the plague which Jah\u0101ngir described, and that the Hanum\u0101n-b\u0101huka was his swan-song, recorded by his friends as he lay at the point of death.\n\nIt is historically true that the poet died in Benares, and that the plague was rife in that city at the time of his death. It also appears that the symptoms of the disease from which he died, so far as the poet has described them, agree with the symptoms exhibited by patients suffering from that terrible pestilence.\n4.

(head workman) the rules and regulations in writing, causing the first to affix thereto his seal and the second, his signature. This statement should show the manner in which the dies (sikkah), and gold coins (ashrafi), and silver coins (rupaiyah) etc., are weighed; what wages are paid to the labourers and the melters of the gold and silver; the payment for the cost of the fire used in melting (haqqu-n-n\u016br); and the expenses for salt and for able (?); the maukah (query read, p\u0113kh\u0101sh, the present or offering) of the scoria-sifters (niy\u0101rah);* and what is collected from Mahomedans and from Hindus. Also whence the items are obtained that come under the heading \u201cTo be credited to Government.\u201d Also the persons to whom pay from the Government should be given and to what amount. He (the superintendent) should become acquainted with the rules of each place (i.e. each Mint), and should carry out everything according\n\n* From either Hindi, niy\u0101ra, separate, or A. P. niy\u0101r, plural of n\u016br, fire.\nto rule and custom, and in obedience to such new instructions as may be issued by the Emperor.\n\nHe should keep a daily account of the stock of coins. [Afz\u016bn is the total of an account, and here I take it as meant for a statement of receipts and issues, showing (1) balance of previous day, (2) receipts, (3) issues, (4) Afz\u016bn or balance at end of the day]. He should pay the dues and expenses of the Mint at the office of the provincial governor. When traders bring gold or silver to be coined, it should be weighed in the presence of the receiving officials and then be made over to the melters. The melters having melted down the metal return it to the receiving official. He (the superintendent) should inspect it. If the gold on the touch stone (mi\u1e25akk) and the silver by melting and t\u0101b (lustre?), appear below the standard of fineness (kam-\u2018iy\u0101r), they must be given back to be melted over again until they are fit for approval for minting.\n\nWhen the melters have re-melted the metal, the mugallis (\"round pieces of \"the size of coined money,\" Blochmann, Ain, I, 22, line 31) which in Hindi are called m\u0101l\u0101 (rosary? garland? necklace?) are prepared. And in his own presence he (the superintendent) causes the separate f\u0101rsh (blanks or discs?) for the coin to be prepared and makes them over to the strikers. The ashaf\u012b is of 9 m\u0101shah and 6 surkh, the rupee of 10 m\u0101shah and 2 surkh. The Half and Quarter, down to half a rati, are made according to these weights.\n\nThe expenses are levied in the following manner and by the following rules:\n\n**Mahomedans.\u2014** Per muhr (gold coin) 5 annas, 5 gandah (-20 kauri?)\n\nPer 100 rupees (silver coin), Rs. 2\u00bd.\n\n**Hindus.\u2014** For these there are two rates:\n\nI. Merchants who are permanently employed.\n\nPer muhr, five (5) annas\n\nPer 100 Rupees, Rs. 2-2-0.\n\nII. Money changers and others who are not on the fixed list.\n\nPer muhr, seven (7) annas,\n\nPer 100 Rupees, Rs. 3-0-0.\n\nThe items which come under the heading \"Receipts to be credited to \"Government\" are as follows. The first item is that from the melters, on account of the sifters (niy\u0101rah), the fragments of metal being collected by them out of the charcoal ashes. These are called \u1e33us\u016bb ('sediment?). For this the melters pay in 12 annas per 1,000 coin. The silver men pay 2 rupees monthly and the melters one rupee monthly under the head of Present (peshkash) into the government\ntreasury. The payments are made over to the D\u012bw\u0101n (the chief revenue official) of the province (s\u016bbah).\n\nThe melters and the d\u0101rr\u0101b [query read, s\u0101rr\u0101b\u0101n, the strikers, or preferably d\u0101r\u016b-b\u0101n, literally \"hammer-man,\" from d\u0101r\u016b, a smith's hammer, Steingass, 506] take from the merchants (mah\u0101j\u0101n) and others under the head of \u1e25aqqu-n-w\u0101r (literally, \"right of fire?\" that is fee for melting?) seven (7) annas in every thousand [coins]. Over and above this sum they take for the cost of salt and able (?).\n\nThe expenses met by government are:\n\nWages of the d\u0101r\u016b-b\u0101n (striker ?) per 100 coins ... 2\u00bd annas.\n\nRepairs of the ghan (anvil or sledge hammer)\nand m\u00fcslah (query for m\u00fcsl, a pestle, or\nma\u1e63\u0101l\u0101h, ingredients ?) per 1,000 ... ... \u00bd anna.\n\nCharcoal (ang\u0101l), per 1,000 ... ... 8 annas.\n\nThe pay of the pekh\u0101r (head clerk), the d\u0101rogh\u0101h (superintendent)\nthe t\u0101hwild\u0101r (store-keeper and cashier), the melters, the strikers\n(sikk\u0101hgar\u0101m), the testing officer, and the watchmen posted to the Mint,\nare provided out of the dues. If any place has a particular rule, that\nrule is followed. Otherwise the general regulations apply. The coin\nstrikers must be ordered to see that each coin is clearly stamped with\nthe Emperor's name, the year of the reign, and the name of the Mint,\nalso that the edge of the farsh (disc) of the coin is not cracked through\ninsufficient melting and bad testing.\n\n---\n\nLIBRARY.\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the\nmeeting held in April last:\u2014\n\nTRANSACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS AND JOURNALS,\n\npresented by the respective Societies and Editors.\n\nBatavia.

REPORT ON 40 old Silver Coins, forwarded by Deputy Collector of Bhagalpur with his No. 2525, dated 19th February, 1897.\n\nThe coins were found on the 27th February, 1896, by one Munshi Mundar of Jogsur, Thana Kotwali, Town Bhagalpur, while digging earth in his own compound. They are Rupees of the Mughal Emperors Akbar, Jah\u0101ng\u012br and Sh\u0101hjahan; most of them are in an indifferent condition.\n\nThey may be thus classified:\n\nAKBAR (A.H. 963\u20131014 = A.D. 1556\u20131605):\n\nIl\u0101hi Rupees of Alm\u0101d\u0101b\u0101d Mint, as in Brit.

Report on 20 old coins, forwarded by Maulavi Fa\u1e93l-ull\u0101h, Sub-Registrar of Gaya, with his letters, dated 27th May, 1897, and 9th July, 1897.\n\nThey were found some 10 feet below the surface of the earth, when a well was sunk in a village called Erki, about 29 miles north of Gaya, situated midway on the Patna and Gaya Road. They belong to the class called 'punch-marked Coins,' and are of silver, 7 being round pieces, and the rest, viz., 13 approximately square or oblong pieces. The punch-marks on the Obv. of these coins are the usual ones; the Rev. of a few pieces shows traces of a wheel and some other marks of uncertain meaning. Nothing can be said as to the date of these coins. Speaking generally, this class must be considered the oldest among Indian coins, but we do not know how long the practice of issuing money of this kind continued in the different parts of India.\n\nIV. Report on 163 old coins forwarded by the Deputy Commissioner of Nimar with his No. 2741, dated 6th July, 1897.\n\nNothing is known as to locality and time of the find.\n\nThe coins are Rupees of the S\u016bri King Sh\u012br Sh\u0101h, and the Mughal Emperors Akbar, Jah\u0101ng\u012br, Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n and Aurangz\u0113b, mostly in an indifferent condition.\n\nSh\u012br Sh\u0101h (A.H. 946\u2013952 = A.D. 1539\u20131545):\n\nType similar to Brit.

Report on 743 old coins forwarded by the Collector of Darbhanga with his No. 1201, dated Laheria Serai, 7th August, 1897.\n\nThe coins were discovered at the time of digging a tank at a village called Rauna Berai. On examining them, I found them to be 28 copper pieces and 715 silver coins, all of which belong to the class commonly known as \"Indo-Sassanian coins\" or \"Gadhiye paise.\" Unfortunately, most of them are very much worn off, and they do not therefore throw as much new light on this doubtful class of Hindu coins, as might be expected from such a large find.\n\nThey may be thus classified:\n\n1. Var\u0101ha-coins:\n   Obv. Var\u0101ha-avat\u0101ra of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u;\n   Rev. Legend: \u010crimad-\u0100di-Var\u0101ha, and traces of fire-altar below.\n   See Cunningham, Coins of Medi\u00e6val India, p. 49 and Plate VI, figs. 20 and 21; Rapson, Indian Coins, \u00a7 110 and Plate V, fig. 5. They are attributed to King Bh\u014djad\u0113va of Kanauj (c. 850\u2013900 A.D.):\n\n   (a) Copper-coins ... ... ... 28\n   (b) Silver-coins ... ... ... 23 : 51\n\n2. Vigraha-coins:\n   Obv.

Similar type, very rude:\n   Obv. Head of king to r.\n   Legend: Gri-vi-(ha?)\n   Rev. Fire-altar.\n   Identical with No. 8545-8550, p. 94, Part III, of Mr. Rodgers' Catalogue of Coins in Indian Museum. They look very much like a crude imitation of type 2, the only difference being the absence of the letter ma on Rev. and a different arrangement of the legend on Obv. Most of the specimens belonging to this type are very much worn, showing only slight traces of Gri on Obv. The letter vi is visible on about 100 specimens; after this on about 10 specimens, traces of a third letter, perhaps ha, can be seen. What the complete legend of Obv. really was, remains doubtful, but the coins may safely be described as a rude imitation of the Vighraha-Type (No. 2).\n\n| Number of pieces (Silver) | ... | ... | 683 |\n|---------------------------|-----|-----|-----|\n| Total                     | ... |     | 743 |\n\nVI. Report on 14 old Silver Coins, 30 broken pieces of such, and 2 melted pieces, forwarded by Covenanted Deputy Collector in charge of Deputy Commissioner's Office, Sonthal Parganas, with his No. R 8837, dated 10th December, 1897.\n\nThe coins are reported to have been found by a boy in Chandigarh, a village in the Rajmahal Subdivision, Sonthal Parganas, where they lay buried under-ground in a small earthen pot. Out of the 30 broken pieces, six complete coins could be put together, the total amount of coins thus being 20. All of them are Rupees of the Independent Kings of Bengal. They are, as a rule, in a fair condition, the legends being clearly legible, but, unfortunately, the margins, containing the date are gone in most of them. Coins of this class are rare, and possess a great numismatic value.\n\nTheir classification is thus:\n\nSikandar Shah I. (A.H. 759-792 = A.D. 1358-1389):\nas in Brit. Mus. Cat., No. 37. Mint Firuzabad on one coin, Date obliterated ... ... ... 2\n\nGhiyasuddin Azam Shah (A.H. 792-799 = A.D.\n1389\u20131396): as in Brit. Mus. Cat., No. 60.

Deputy Commissioner of Bhandharia with his No. 616, dated 15th February, 1898.\n\nThe coins are stated to have been found buried in the village of Jam in the District of Bhandaria. They were described as \"Nagpuri Rupees,\" but really they are Rupees of the Mughal Emperors Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u0101h and Ahmad Sh\u0101h:\n\nOf Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u0101h (A.H. 1131\u20131161 = A.D. 1719\u20131748) there are 50 Rupees, all from the S\u016brat Mint, 46 bearing the date: regnal year 28.\n\nOf Ahmad Sh\u0101h (A.H. 1161\u20131167 = A.D. 1748\u20131754) there are 565 Rupees, all from the Katak (Cuttack) Mint; most of them have the regnal year 5, to which, however, on a good many specimens the figures 7 or 12 or some other units are added (see also coin No. 9123 in Catalogue of Indian Museum, Part II, p. 71). I am unable to account for this curious irregularity.\nVIII. Report on 110 old coins, and 6 broken pieces of such, forwarded by Deputy Commissioner of Rawalpindi, with his No. 936-G, dated 9th March, 1898.\n\nThe coins were found in a ravine within the limits of Nakka, a village in the Pindi Gheh Tahsil of the Rawalpindi District. They are all silver coins (dirhams) of the early Pathan Sultan of Delhi, Muhammad ibn Sam, mostly in an indifferent condition.\n\nThe following varieties are found among them:\n\nMuhammad ibn Sam (A.H. 589-602 = A.D. 1193-1205):\n\n(1) Type as in Brit. Mus. Cat., No. 2, Mint: Ghazni on three coins; date: fi-l-awwal zi-l-hijjah \"on the first day of Zu-l-hijjah\" on two coins; fi zi-l-hijjah, year 596 on one; others illegible; ... 4\n\n(2) Type as in Brit.

They are Rupees of different Bengal Sultans; a few coins belong to the Bahmani Sultan T\u0101ju-d-din Fir\u016bz Sh\u0101h, to the S\u016bri Kings Isl\u0101m Sh\u0101h and Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u0101h, and the Mughal Emperor Hum\u0101y\u016bn.

They are all rupees of the Mughal Emperor Sh\u0101h \u0100lam II. (A.H. 1173\u20131221 = A.D. 1759\u20131806) of the \u2018Azim\u0101b\u0101d (Patna) Mint, struck in the regnal years 7, 8 and 9: viz., 11 coins of year 7; 10 coins of year 8; and 18 coins of year 9; type as in Brit. Mus. Cat., No. 1166.\n\nThe Philological Secretary contributed the following obituary notice of the death of Dr. George B\u00fchler, an Honorary Member of the Society.\n\nDr. George B\u00fchler, an Honorary Member of the Society, whose death has been reported at the last meeting, was born on the 19th June, 1837 in Borstel, a small country-place in Hannover. He studied in G\u00f6ttingen under Benfey Sanskrit and Comparative Philology, and took his degree of Ph. D. in 1858. He then went first to Paris and later on to England where he was employed for some time as an assistant in the Queen\u2019s private Library in Windsor. In 1863, he was appointed Professor of Oriental Languages in the Elphinstone College in Bombay, in 1866 Superintendent of Sanskrit Studies in the Deccan College in Poona, and later on Educational Inspector in Gujarat. In 1880, when he resigned his Indian Service, the University of Vienna selected him for the newly created professorship of Sanskrit; he was made an\nOrdinary Member of the Imperial Academy of Science in Vienna, and given the title of Hofrath. He was elected an Honorary Member of our Society in 1895.\n\nHis death occurred on the 8th April by a very deplorable accident. He had started on a journey to Z\u00fcrich to spend the Easter holidays with his wife and son who were then living at that place. On his journey he halted for a few days in Lindau, where he hired a small boat, a so-called \"nutshell,\" in which he went out alone to enjoy a moonlight night on the beautiful Lake of Constanze. But the waters of that dangerous sea that had claimed so many victims before, proved dangerous to him also. On the next day, the boat was seen driving on the sea without its inmate, whose body still lies buried under the depth of the water. It was not till much later that his family, who were looking out anxiously for his arrival, came to know of that sad occurrence, which had bereaved them of a beloved husband and father, and his friends of one who was dear to them not only as a scholar who stood foremost of all in Oriental learning, but also as a man of a truly noble mind and great character.\n\nIn an obituary note published in a German paper, the late Professor has been rightly called the centre of all those learned investigations that are at present directed towards elucidating the ancient history and literature of India. There is hardly any one among the living Sanskritists of Europe and America as well, as of India to whom the late Professor was not known either by literary correspondence, or personally, and scarcely any one has addressed him on any question connected with this wide field of learning, who did not receive from him an answer that not only improved upon his own knowledge of the subject, but very often helped him essentially in seeing his way through some difficult point in connection with his researches. In India itself, it is especially the Bombay Presidency where the fruits of his labours planted during the 18 years he served this country, are still ripening. Witness to this is not only that excellent series of Sanskrit Text publications, the Bombay Sanskrit Series, which was begun and carried on under his own superintendence, in connection with his colleague, Prof. Kielhorn, not only the work done in that Presidency as well as in adjacent parts of India in connection with the search for Sanskrit Manuscripts which was started by him also in connection with Prof. Kielhorn, nay it may be fairly said that a good deal of the increasing interest among Native scholars of that part of the country for their ancient Literature and History is due to his direct personal influence.\n\nHis literary work was connected firstly with the ancient Law-books\nof India a subject on which he was one of the first authorities. For Sir R. West's Digest of Hindu Law he wrote the Introduction dealing with the history of S\u016brti. Of the ancient Law-books written in prose, which preceded the later standard codifications of Manu and Y\u0101j\u00f1avalkya, the Dharma-\u00e7\u0101stra of \u0100pastamba was first made known by him; this and the corresponding Law-books of Gautama, Baudh\u0101yana and Vasistha were translated by him, and his translation of Manu, published in the same series, the Sacred Books of the East, is a work of far more than literary merits to Indian Lawyers.\n\nHere as in all his other publications he showed that admirable combination of a thoroughly philological knowledge of the subject with a practical knowledge of modern India and its people, that gave him such a great advantage over many of his European colleagues who have only to resort to their books, and never come in connection with the country and its inhabitants.\n\nThe next subject taken up by him, was the history and literature of the Jainas. Dr. Hoernle in his Presidential Address has newly given us an admirable survey of the work done in this long neglected branch of Indian Antiquities, and he has already pointed to the large amount of advancement in knowledge in this field of research which we owe to the late Professor. His work here is partly connected with the decipherment of the ancient Jaina Inscriptions from Mathur\u0101, and this brings me to that particular branch of investigation where, as has been observed, Prof. B\u00fchler has done more than any other living Sanskritist of his time. I refer to Inscriptions and History. It will be known to most of us, that Prof. B\u00fchler's readings of the A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101ka Inscriptions are far superior to any previous endeavours to read and translate those curious ancient documents. He was the first to adhere strictly to the principle that the texts should be explained as they stand, without allowing any arbitrary alterations of modern critics, and scarcely any other scholar commanded over such a wide knowledge of the ancient literature of Hindus, Jainas or Bauddhas as he did, or knew to utilize even out of the way scraps of information so masterly as he. As a result of all his investigations in the wide field of Indian Inscriptions he published lately his Indian Palaeography, that admirable survey of the history of writing in India that makes it now so easy even to outsiders to gain an oversight over the result of various learned researches dispersed hitherto in different often hardly accessible Periodicals.\n\nThis work together with Prof. Jolly's book on Indian Law and Custom, were the first specimens to appear of the famous Encyclopaedia of Indo-Aryan Research which Tr\u00fcbner started under the superintendence of the late Professor. He himself was going to publish in the\nsame series an Indian History, a treatise on the Geography of India (in connection with Dr. Stein), an introductory work on literary and epigraphical sources of Indian History, and in connection with Sir R. West, and Prof. Jolly a work on Political Antiquities of India. And if the sudden death of the late Professor seems so extremely sad and deplorable, it is partly because we now cannot expect to get these books from his pen, that touched nothing which it did not adorn. If any one, it was he who by his previous researches as well as by his high literary capacities was entitled to write the History of India. The work will probably have to be entrusted to some other scholar. There seems but little hope that his Manuscript might be so far advanced as to be ready for publication, but the Encyclop\u00e6dia, it is hoped, will be continued.\n\nBut even now, though we are to deplore the loss of such a book which would do so much help to everyone who works on this subject, the work done by the late Professor has advanced our knowledge of Indian Literature and History to such a degree, that it is scarcely said too much, if I contend that in many respects Sanskrit in Europe and India, would not stand where it now stands, if it had not been for the labours of the late Professor B\u00fchler.\n\nThe following paper was read:\n\n*The Personal History of Dr. William Hamilton.*\u2014By C.

Buddha worshipped by Indra: a favorite subject of Ancient Indian Art (with exhibition of photographs).\u2014By Dr. Theodore Bloch, Ph.D.\n\nThe first photograph which I have the honour to show you, is taken from a fine piece of sculpture, measuring 3' 10\" \u00d7 2' 8\", excavated from the ruins of a Buddhist St\u016bpa in the Swat Valley, and deposited now in the Indian Museum. It shows a figure of Buddha, seated inside of a cave on what is intended for the vajrasana or diamond throne, in the attitude of meditating. His head is surrounded by the usual nimbus, while flames burst out from the cave, indicative of the bh\u0101ma\u015b\u0101la or halo which, according to the Nid\u0101nakath\u0101, \"reaplendent with many colours, proceeded to a fathom's length all round his person.\" The cave evidently lies in a mountain, covered with jungle. This is indicated by the trees on top of the sculpture, as well as by the animals inhabiting the scene. A host of d\u0113vas or angels stand on both sides of\n\n---\n\n1 These two lines form a \u00c7loka.\n2 I regret that it is impossible at present to publish this photograph.\n3 Rhys Davids, Buddhist Birth Stories, Vol. i, p. 125; J\u0101taka, ed. Faub\u00f6ll, Vol. i, p. 89: n\u0101n\u0101vir\u0101ga\u1e47amujjal\u0101ya sar\u012brappabh\u0101ya ... vy\u0101mappabh\u0101parikkh\u0113pasamupab\u016bjh\u0101ya. The halo is frequently mentioned in the Nid\u0101nakath\u0101.\nthe cave, along the slope of the mountain; some have their hands folded in the attitude of worshipping, others throw down flowers indicative of the *puspav\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6di* or rain of flowers, which, according to Buddhist legend, used to fall down wherever the Blessed One sat or walked. The principal figure among them is the one standing at the bottom of the sculpture next to the cave. His high rank can be easily recognised by the fact that he enjoys the benefit of having an umbrella worn over him, which, in ancient Indian Art, is always the sign of a royal person. A second figure stands parallel to the king as we may call him at present on the other side of the cave; head and upper portion of body is gone, but from what remains, it is evident that he was represented as playing a musical instrument, apparently a harp.\n\nWhom are the two figures, the king and the harp-player, intended for? There can be no doubt that the scene is identical with a relief of the Bharhut Stupa (figured in Plate XXVIII of Cunningham's *St\u016bpa of Bharhut*), which is labelled by an ancient inscription as *Idas\u0101laguha*, or 'the Indras\u0101la Cave.' The story to which this refers, is told by the Chinese pilgrims Fa-Hian and Hiuen Thsang, and also by Spence Hardy according to some Ceylonese author.\u00b9 The gist of the story is that Indra once showed an eager desire to pay his reverence to Buddha, and taking with himself his musician Pa\u00f1ca\u00e7ikha, went to the Indras\u0101la or Indra\u00e7aila mountain where Buddha was seated meditating in a lonely cave. Pa\u00f1ca\u00e7ikha sung a number of stanzas in praise of Buddha, which he accompanied on his harp, and hereafter Indra proposed forty-two questions to Buddha, writing each one of them singly with his finger upon a stone.\u00b2\n\nIn the Bharhut relievo, the harp-player stands outside the cave; Indra is seated inside, surrounded by his attendants, his face turned towards a throne which is surmounted by an umbrella, the usual sign in the Bharhut sculptures to indicate the presence of Buddha, he himself being never represented here. A few animals and a tree are seen above the cave.\n\nThe same scene is also found in Sanchi and Gaya. The latter (Plate VIII, fig. 7 in Cunningham's *Mah\u0101bodhi*) is very poor, only one person, apparently the harp-player, standing outside the cave; no sign\n\n\u00b9 Travels of Fa-hian, translated by Beal, Chapter xxviii, p. 110; St. Julien's Hiuen Thsang, Vol. ii, p. 59; Hardy, Manual, p. 298; see also Cunningham, Stupa of Bharhut, p. 88.\n\n\u00b2 I need not mention here that Cunningham has tried to identify the Indra\u00e7ailaguha with a locality in the neighbourhood of Girya\u015b\u0101k. It is near this place that a long inscription in \"shell characters\" is found. Now if Fa-Hian tells us, that \"the traces of these questions yet exist,\" are we to assume that those so-called \"shell characters\" already existed in his time?\nof Buddha, as indeed might be expected, and not even of Indra, being found in the medallion. Sanchi has got a much better relievo of the same scene. It is shown in Fig. 1 on Plate XXIX of Fergusson's Tree and Serpent worship, and occupies one of the compartments in the left post of the northern gateway of the big Stupa. Here the cave is evidently sculptured according to well-known models in the Barabar Hills or similar caves, some of which are still in existence. Indra with his attendants form a group of two rows of figures (five in each) in the lower half of the relievo. Indra I take to be the figure in the centre of the upper-most row, turning his head towards the cave; Pa\u00f1ca\u00e7ikha stands at the right end of the same row. Buddha's throne is shown as if standing outside the cave; this is merely due to want of skill on part of the sculptor.\n\nThe last three sculptures, viz., Bharhut, Gaya, and Sanchi, are scarcely younger than 150 B.C. The date of the Swat sculpture is probably not before 150 A.D. To the same date also belongs a sculpture from Mathur\u0101, now in the Indian Museum, which is figured on Plate 60, fig. 1 of Burgess. The ancient Monuments, Temples and Sculptures of India (London 1897, W. Griggs, Part I). It agrees with the Swat sculpture (1) in showing Buddha in person seated in the cave; (2) in placing Indra and Pa\u00f1ca\u00e7ikha each on one side of the cave; but it differs in representing a huge elephant, Indra's vehicle, standing behind Indra's attendant, and taking up with his trunk some flowers, apparently intended as arghya for Buddha. Among the Gandhara sculptures, finally, the same scene occurs very often; the Indian Museum has got no less than six duplicates; a further one is in Lahore, of which the Indian Museum has got a cast and a photograph. In later Buddhist Art, I do not remember to have met with this scene; but perhaps it may be found among the wall paintings of Ajanta.\n\nMy object in putting together all these various sculptures is not merely to deduct from this comparative study the well-known and often repeated, but hitherto unexplained fact that figures of Buddha occur first after Indian Art in touch with Greek or Roman sculptures. It is also not my intention to dwell here at length on another not uninteresting conclusion which we might draw from a comparison of these various sculptures. I am alluding to the advanced skill of artistic composition which is evident, I believe, if we put together the Bharhut and the Swat sculpture, and which we may safely pronounce as due to Greek or Western influence. It is just the\n\n1 It forms the upper-most compartment of a slab greater in length than in breadth, and divided into five horizontal compartments. The technical name of such a slab was ardhaupatta as we learn from the Amravati Inscriptions.\nopposite lesson which this comparative study teaches us: the artists of Gandhara took over the Indras\u0101laguh\u0101 scene from purely Indian Art, and though they apparently re-modelled it according to their own higher standard of artistic taste, yet they remained true to their Indian models even so far as to copy minor details from them, as for instance, the curious animals and rather conventional trees which we noticed in the Swat sculpture. Hitherto, Archaeologists, in dealing with Gandhara Art, have been in the habit of searching very eagerly for the Greek or Roman prototypes of the various sculptures that are found in the North-West of India. I am afraid they have often run the risk of overlooking the Indian character of this Art. So, to give one example out of many. In Gandhara we often meet with a scene where a serpent-king with some of his daughters is represented in the act of worshipping Buddha. Those N\u0101gas or N\u0101ginis are always figured as human beings with a huge cobra coming out over their head. This is decidedly Indian, and I doubt if a Greek or Roman sculptor to whom a similar task is set, would have ever chosen this way. But there is another still more important point. Snakes, according to Indian superstition, inhabit tanks and ponds of water. Consequently in all those N\u0101ga-sculptures they are represented with only the upper portion of their body coming out from the water. This latter point has always been declared a true mark of Greek influence. But it is not so. For in Bharhut already, we meet with the same artistic trick, if I may call it so, in the relievo, labelled as \u0112rapa\u1e6d\u014d N\u0101gar\u0101j\u0101 Bhagavat\u014d vada\u1e6d, i.e., the serpent-king \u0112rapa\u1e6d\u014d worships the Blessed One (i.e., Buddha),\u00b9 and here, of course, the idea of Greek influence is quite out of place.\n\nThis is only one instance of what might almost form a lengthy paper on the connection of Gandhara Art with ancient Indian Art. To discuss this point in full, is not my intention now; I merely want to say that if I be right, those sculptures from Gandhara which show a more Indian character, must be considered as more primitive and consequently older than the higher developed Grecian sculptures.\n\n2. Note on a specimen of the rare Scincoid Lizard Eumeces blythianus, (Anderson) from the Afridi Country; with exhibition of the type specimen.\u2014By F. Finn, B.A., F.Z.S., Deputy Superintendent of the Indian Museum.\n\nWhile with the British forces during the recent military operations against the Afridis, Dr. C. R. M. Green made a small collection of Reptiles in the Afridi country, which he has generously made over to the Museum.\n\n\u00b9 Plate XVI in Cunningham's St\u016bpa of Bharhut.\nAmong these is a specimen of the very rare Skink *Eumeces blythianus* described by Dr. J. Anderson in our *Proceedings* for 1871 (p. 186) as *Mabouia Blythiana*. The type is still in the Museum collection, and is in good condition, except that the colours are very much faded. It is still, however, possible to make out that the markings correspond to Dr. Anderson's description, with which description, as also with the type itself, Dr. Green's specimen closely agrees, though it is younger and smaller; the structural details of scaling, &c., corresponding. In the coloration it is noticeable that in Dr. Green's specimen some red spots are present, not mentioned in the description of Dr. Anderson's type.\n\nThe locality of this type was doubtful when the species was described, it having been purchased from a Bokhara merchant who stated that he obtained it at Amritsar. No fresh specimen had been obtained when Mr. Boulenger published his volume on *Reptilia* and *Batrachia* in the \"Fauna of British India\" series in 1890, and that gentleman there suggests that the species may not be Indian.\n\nDr. Green, therefore, has the credit of giving this rare species, if not a name, at least a \"local habitation.\"\n\nHis specimen has been sent to the British Museum, and I herewith exhibit the type, which has been re-coloured according to the markings displayed by this fresher specimen.\n\nI have to acknowledge my obligations to Dr. Aloock, who entrusted the specimen to me for identification, for the opportunity of re-introducing this obscure species to naturalists.\n\n3. *The Lepcha or Rong Language as illustrated in its Songs.*\u2014By L.

It is written in imitation of K\u0101lid\u0101sa\u2019s inimitable work the Meghad\u016bta. It begins with a description of an imaginary golden city at the top of the Sandalwood Mountain, Candan\u0101dri, in the extreme south of India. There in that city dwelt a damsel belonging to the race of the celestial musicians, the Gandharvas. Her name was Kuvalayavat\u012b. Lak\u1e63m\u0101na Sena, in his conquest of the world came to the South. She saw him, and, unknown to him, she fell in love.\n\n\u0924\u0930\u094d\u0915\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0915\u093e \u091c\u0941\u0935\u093e\u092f\u0935\u0932\u0940 \u0928\u093e\u092e \u0917\u0928\u094d\u0927\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0923\u094d\u092f\u093e\n\u092e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0947 \u091c\u0948\u0935\u0902 \u091c\u0941\u0939\u0941\u092e\u0927\u0930\u094d\u0932\u094b\u0921\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092f\u0941\u0902 \u092f\u093e \u091b\u093e\u0930\u0916\u0964\n\u0926\u0943\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0902 \u0936\u0941\u092d\u0935\u093f\u091c\u0928\u0947 \u092c\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0902 \u091a\u094c\u0927\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0902\n\u092c\u093e\u0939\u093e \u0938\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0903 \u091c\u0941\u0939\u0941\u092e\u0927\u0935\u0941\u0903 \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u092f\u0947\u092f\u0940\u0935\u092d\u0941\u0903\u0965\n\nMaddened in the advent of the spring and finding the South wind blowing to the North, she resolved upon making the wind her messenger. As in the Meghad\u016bta, the road is described. A few miles from the Candan\u0101dri is the P\u0101ndyade\u00e7a with its capital Uraga on the T\u0101mapar\u1e47i abounding in betel-nut trees. Uraga is mentioned by K\u0101lid\u0101sa also, as the capital of the Pandyade\u00e7a in the sixth canto of his Raghuva\u1e47\u00e7a; though modern Archaeologists think that Uraiy\u016bra was the capital of the Chola; while Madura was the capital of the Pandya country. Mallin\u0101th thinks that Uragapura was N\u0101gapura or N\u0101gapattana. In the MS. itself there is a note to the effect that Uraga is N\u0101gapura.\nFrom N\u0101gapura the messenger goes to Setuvandha which is close by and which is used by the citizens as a resort of pleasure. The Bridge is compared to an arm of the earth sent towards the island of Lank\u0101. The poet advises the messenger to pay his homage to the phallic emblem of \u010civa stationed there entitled R\u0101me\u00e7vara.\n\nThence he should proceed to K\u0101nci the Queen of Southern India. It is said to be on a small rivulet named Suvata. From K\u0101nci the Messenger is advised to go to K\u0101veri where the Keralis play their pranks. The water rises up to the waist and no more. Blowing to the North the South wind comes to the Mountain M\u0101lyav\u0101n, the scene of R\u0101ma's lamentations. This is perhaps in the Nellur district. Thence to the sheet of water known as Panc\u0101psara mentioned in Raghuvan\u00e7a, and identified by Mr. Beglar in vol. XIII of Sir A. Cunningham's Report with a dried up lake near Bijr\u0101mapura the residence of the Raja of Sirguja. Blowing northward the wind comes to the Andhra country with its noble river the God\u0101v\u0101ri; passing which is the Kalinga Nagara on the seashore. To the north of this is the Vindhya Range with its beautiful woodlands through the Bamboo groves of which flow the Rev\u0101. To the north of this is the Yay\u0101tinagara or J\u0101japura where the Keralia women enjoy the sports of love. Kerala is the name of the M\u0101l\u0101b\u0101r coast and Western Maisur. One may be surprised to hear of the Keralia women in the capital of Orissa. But it was about the time of Lak\u1e63hm\u0101na Sena that the Kongas from Kerala conquered Ud\u012bgya and founded what is known as the Gangavan\u00e7a.\n\nFrom the capital of Utkala the invisible Messenger blows to the country known as Suhma, or what is now known as the Western Bengal. There in that country was a temple of Raghukulagaru, apparently \u010civa with half his person occupied by Parvat\u012b, on the Ganges, that is, the Bh\u0101girathi. Between the temple and the river is the embankment thrown by B\u0101llala Sena. To the north of this, is the holy country in which Yamun\u0101 separates herself from the Ganges. This is Triveni about 30 miles north of Calcutta. To the north of this is the capital of Bengal on the Ganges. Its name is Vijoyapura and there is a victorious camp.\n\nThe females of Bengal at this time were fond of ornaments made of palm-leaves and they were also fond of swinging machines.\n\n7.

Communicated by the Anthropological Secretary.\n\nThe paper will be published in the Journal, Part III.\nPROCEEDINGS\nOF THE\nASIATIC SOCIETY OF BENGAL,\nFOR AUGUST, 1898.\n\nThe Monthly General Meeting of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, was held on Wednesday, the 3rd August, 1898, at 9-15 p.m.\n\nThe Hon. Mr. H. H. Risley, C.I.E., B.A., I.C.S.,\nPresident, in the chair.\n\nSeventeen members and five visitors were present.\n\nThe minutes of the last meeting were read and confirmed.\n\nSixty-one presentations were announced.\n\nSurgeon-Major D. W. S. Bain, I.M.S.; Babu Sitaram, M.A., and Surgeon-Captain C. R. M. Green, F.R.C.S., I.M.S., were ballotted for and elected Ordinary Members.\n\nThe Secretary reported the death of Mr. U. C. Batabyal, I.C.S.\n\nThe President exhibited Photographs of Coorgs and Yeravas taken by Mr. T. H. Holland.\n\nThe Philological Secretary read the following letters from Dr. A. F. R. Hoernle, C.I.E., Vice-President, A. S. B., and Babu M. M. Chakravarti, Deputy Magistrate, Gaya:\n\nSimla, 15th July, 1898.\n\nDear Dr. Bloch,\n\nI send you a letter from Babu M. M. Chakravarti, which appears to me deserving of publication in the Proceedings of the Society. So very little is known regarding this particular class of coins that any suggestions coming from the Babu who has made Orissa his special duty, are valuable and will be welcome to Numismatists generally.\nBeing in Simla, away from all reference books, I cannot enter fully into the Babu's queries; but it appears to me very likely that both his suggestions may be correct, that some of the coins should rather be ascribed to Anagga Bhima, and that the numeral figures should be read as he proposes to read them.\n\nGaya, 10th July, 1898.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nYour interesting notes on the Ganga coins received from Angul, I have only lately come across. May I suggest the following points for your consideration and remarks?\n\nAll the coins are ascribed to one king, Anantavarman alias C\u014dd\u0101ganga. May I ask why they should be presumed to belong to only one king? Three coins bear letter-groups indicating a name. No. 29 has been correctly read as \"Cri-ga(m)-ga;\" No. 22, seems to bear the letters \"Cri-ana...;\" No. 18 has letters hardly legible, such as Cri ??, but possibly they are Cri-ana.... The letters \"Cri-ana,\" might be the initial letters of Anantavarman, Ananga Bhima, or Aniyanka Bhima. Of these, Anantavarman is not probable, because it is merely a title common to the early Ganga kings and on such small coins only the names of the kings would have been stamped. I find Dr. Hultzsch has taken C\u014dd\u0101ganga to be a surname, but it is the real name, while Anantavarman is the surname. Then again Aniyanka Bhima appears to be only a variant of the name Ananga Bhima; and the only king named Aniyanka has also been called Ananga. Would it not be therefore better to infer that No. 22 (and possibly No. 18), are coins of Ananga Bhima D\u0113va? Some of the other coins might also belong to any other early Ganga king, other than C\u014dd\u0101ganga.\n\nMay I ask how the date has been arrived at? The earliest figures used in Orissa (and probably in Kalinga) will be found in the copper plates printed in J. A. S. B., 1896, Plates VIII to XVIII (left hand side near the holes). From the figures there given and from others which I recollect, the figures 3 and 9 of the coins as now read would seem to be 2 and 5. Hence the following would appear to be the correct reading:\n\nin No. 17, 22 for 33.\n,, No. 18, 12 for 13.\n,, No. 19, 2 for 3.\n,, No. 21, 5 for 9.\n,, No. 22, 24 for 34.\n,, No. 23, 24 for 34.\n,, No. 27, 15 for 19.\n,, No. 28, 22 for 33.\nSimilarly I would correct Dr. Hultzsch's readings in Nos. 24, 25 and 30 to 24, 27, and 2 for 34, 37, and 3. His No. 33 is not legible in the autotype.\n\nThe coins have been named as \"Hoonas.\" H\u00fcna is a general word in Orissa and Ganjam for small old coins. Correctly they would be \"fanams,\" 1/10th of \"M\u0101rhas.\" The existence of these coins I deduced from the M\u0101dal\u0101 P\u0101\u00f1ji and others, in my article on Troy Weights of Orissa (J. A. S. B., 1892, pp. 44-5). Since then the M\u0101rhas have been found mentioned in copper-plate inscriptions of the king N\u1e5bsi\u1e41ha D\u0113va IV. (J. A. S. B., 1895, pp. 150 and 158), and in many inscriptions in the \u010cri K\u016brm\u0101\u1e47 temple, Chicacole, transcripts of most of which I secured 5 or 6 years back. Nos. 24 and 25 of Dr. Hultzsch's list I would identify as M\u0101rhas.\n\nThe coins show that in the times of R\u0101jar\u0101ja and C\u014ddaga\u1e45ga many of the letters and figures had approached modern Oriy\u0101 types. Hence they appear to me very interesting.\n\nThe following papers were read:\u2014\n\n1.

Cachar Hills.\"\nMaibong, now an executive station of the Assam Bengal Railway, was formerly the site of an old Kachari settlement. The race halted there before descending to the plains now known as Cachar. Settled in the plains, one Tuleram Senaputti was sent by the Raja back to Maibong in the capacity of governor. Revolting he attempted to set up a kingdom for himself. The clearing of land for the railway has brought to light many evidences of a bygone civilisation far superior to that surrounding the present degenerate descendants of the race. It is safe to assume that on a further clearance of jungle more would be found. Stamped bricks and idols carved in stone lie scattered about but the most prominent record is a temple carved in rock lying in the river bed. Beyond this last I doubt if much will be allowed to remain. It was with difficulty I procured my bricks which are not nearly so good specimens as others I have seen, the property of earlier visitors to the place. As for the idols\u2014they being of some weight\u2014heads and other parts have been broken off and carried away. It would appear to have been no one's business to interfere with this vandalism.\n\nI should be glad to learn more as to this settlement. Perhaps some of your members can throw light on it. Beyond the facts in the statistical account I have seen nothing relating to it.\"\n\nThe Philological Secretary exhibited the ancient Buddhist Relics, excavated by Mr. Claxton Pepp\u00e9 from the Piprahwa Mound, District Basti, N.-W.
