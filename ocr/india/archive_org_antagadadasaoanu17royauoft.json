Created, or at least reconstructed, by Mah\u0101v\u012bra N\u0101ya-putte in the fifth century before Christ, it spread rapidly over the whole of India, a companion and rival of its younger sister Buddhism. Its former greatness may be still traced in the lands north of the Vindhya Mountains by the Jain communities dwelling in most of the centres of culture. But it developed most powerfully in the Dekhan. It found an early home in Maisur, and it proved its gratitude nobly; for the classical literature of the Kanarese language begins with a great series of Jain scholars and poets. In the Tamil country it was equally active, zealously sharing in the highest culture of the age; the noblest of Tamil poems, the J\u012bvaka-cint\u0101ma\u1e47i, is a Jain work, as are several other Tamil classics. And in the presidency of Bombay the literary and social influence of the Jains has been, and still is, very great. Nevertheless, in spite of this history and in spite of the fact that they are still a rich and honoured community,\u00b9 they have been until recent years almost wholly ignored by European students. Sometimes they have been confused with Brahmanic Hinduism, more often with their Buddhist brethren, who hence have obtained more credit than is due to them for the softening of the heart of India. But\n\n\u00b9 Their numbers, according to the latest census, were 1,334,140.\nneither the political, nor the literary, nor the religious history of India can ever be written until an exact study has been made of the parts played therein by both these great Churches.\n\nThe Jain Church, like the Buddhist, claims immense antiquity. According to its traditions, it has passed through twenty-three periods, and is now in the twenty-fourth, dating from the apostolate of Mah\u0101v\u012bra N\u0101ya-putte, or Vaddham\u0101\u1e47e (in Sanskrit Mah\u0101v\u012bra J\u00f1\u0101\u1e6d\u1e5b-putra, or Var\u1e0dham\u0101\u1e47a), whom we shall frequently meet in the following pages under the title of \"The Ascetic\" (sama\u1e47e). The Sanskrit names of his predecessors are, in their traditional order of time, as follows: \u1e5a\u1e63abhan\u0101tha, Ajitan\u0101tha, Sambhavan\u0101tha, Abhinandan\u0101tha, Sumatin\u0101tha, Padmaprabha, Sup\u0101r\u015bvan\u0101tha, Candraprabha, Suvidhin\u0101tha or Pu\u1e63padanta, \u015a\u012btalan\u0101tha, \u015arey\u0101\u1e43san\u0101tha, V\u0101sup\u016bjya-sv\u0101m\u012b, Vimalan\u0101tha, Anantan\u0101tha, Dharm\u0101n\u0101tha, \u015a\u0101ntin\u0101tha, Kunthun\u0101tha, Aran\u0101tha, Mallin\u0101tha, Munisuvrata-sv\u0101m\u012b, Nem\u012bn\u0101tha, Ari\u1e63\u1e6danemi (whom we shall meet in the following pages under the Prakrit name Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha\u1e47emi), and P\u0101r\u015bva-n\u0101tha. Naturally these names are merely legendary, with the possible exception of the last; for it seems quite probable that the movement of Mah\u0101v\u012bra was essentially a reformation of an existing fraternity of P\u0101r\u015bvan\u0101thiya monks.\n\nThe N\u0101ya-putte family was an aristocratic one. They were k\u1e63atriyas, dwelling chiefly in Koll\u0101ga, near the ancient city of Vai\u015b\u0101li, or Ves\u0101li\u00b9; and Mah\u0101v\u012bra was the younger son of one of their rajas. His father, Siddh\u0101rtha, was married to Tri\u015b\u0101la or Videhadatt\u0101 (Vaidehi), sister of Cetaka or Cedaga (Jiyasatt\u016b), King of Ves\u0101li; and of Cetaka\u2019s daughters Cell\u0101\u1e47a married Bimbis\u0101ra or Senie (\u015arenika), the great King of Magadha, while the other, Mig\u0101vai (Mrg\u0101vat\u012b), married Say\u0101\u1e47e or Sat\u0101\u1e47ika of Kosamb\u012b. The family was thus closely connected with some of the\n\n\u00b9 Apparently the city of Ves\u0101li comprised Ves\u0101li proper, Ku\u1e47\u1e0dapura, and V\u0101\u1e47iyagg\u0101ma, which occurs in the present texts. See Hoernle\u2019s Uv\u0101saga-dasa\u1e45, translation, p. 4.\nnoblest houses of Eastern India; and Mah\u0101v\u012bra, who was born, according to tradition, in 599, and died in 527 B.C., had a brilliant political career open to him.\n\n```\nSup\u0101r\u015bva.

To one of his grim temperament religion offered a more honourable career than courts; and the prospect of pontifical power was attractive to an ambitious younger son. At the age of thirty he took the vows, and entered an ascetic fraternity observing the rules traditionally ascribed to P\u0101r\u015bvan\u0101tha. After a short time he left them, and established a severely ascetic brotherhood, claiming direct spiritual descent from P\u0101r\u015bvan\u0101tha and his legendary predecessors. These Nirgranthas, or Nigganthas, as they were called\u2014the word means \u201cloosed from bondage\u201d\u2014became numerous in Bihar,\u00b9 and thence spread their doctrines over the rest of India.\n\nThe Jain creed is based upon the formula of the \u201cNine Verities\u201d (nava-tattva), namely, \u201cSoul, Non-soul, Influx, Exclusion, Dissipation, Imprisonment, Release, Merit, Sin.\u201d As in the Brahmanic and Buddhist creeds, the Jains postu-\n\n\u00b9 The original bounds of this Church\u2019s dominion are indicated by the rule of the Kalpas\u016btra (ed. Schubring, i. 51), which allows friars and nuns to beg their food \u2018eastward as far as Anga and Magadha, southward as far as Kosambi, westward as far as the Th\u016bn\u0101 district, northward as far as Kun\u0101l\u0101; so far it is allowed, so far reaches the holy land, \u0101rie khette.\u2019 For further details of the early history of Jainism the reader may consult Professor Jacobi\u2019s \u2018Gaina S\u016btras\u2019 in the \u2018Sacred Books of the East,\u2019 and Dr. Hoernle\u2019s paper in the Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal for 1898.\nlate an infinite number of souls (j\u012bva), wandering from birth to birth in accordance with their \"works\" in former incarnations. \"Work\" (karma) is a physical force, which by its \"influx\" (\u0101srava) into the soul defiles its ideal purity until its \"dissipation\" (nirjar\u0101); and it is the duty of man to cleanse his soul from this \"imprisonment\" of matter by penances, religious exercises, and godly life, to the end that it may be finally released and dwell for ever apart from physical influences, in a condition of absolute knowledge and bliss.\\(^1\\)\n\nSouls are either immobile or mobile. The former are those in earth, water, fire, wind or air, and vegetation, all of which contain tiny souls. All other forms of life contain \"mobile\" souls; and it is a sin to harm wilfully any soul. Hence the whole of Jain practice is guided by a morbid fear of doing hurt even to the lowest of living things. The orthodox monk dare not eat green vegetables or such as contain seeds;\\(^2\\) during the rainy season he must refrain from travelling, and at all times as he walks along a path he must examine the ground in front of him, for fear of treading upon vermin. Even his lawful food must be carefully scrutinised, lest it contain some tiny living thing; and many carry cloths over their mouths, for fear of swallowing insects inadvertently.\\(^3\\) This morbid view of life has for its logical conclusion the love of death. The ideal of the Jain devotee has always been to cleanse his soul of all the material influences arising from \"works,\" and then to starve himself to death, thus ensuring the eternal salvation of his soul. The two scriptures which are translated in the following pages are for the most part merely a dreary list of legendary devotees who \"saved their souls\" in this way. And this grim ideal has not failed to bear fruit. The stone-cut records of the holy places of Jainism tell many a tale of devotees who have thus done themselves to death. To me there seems to be an infinite pathos in these gloomy stories of gentle souls who have cut\n\n---\n\n1 See further Appendix III.\n2 See pp. 42, 43.\n3 See p. 64.\nshort the fitful fever of their life in a ghastly parody of \"the hope of a blessed resurrection.\"\n\nIn the Jain Canon\u2014which, we may remark, is acknowledged only by the \u015avet\u0101mbara branch of the Church, and is not accepted as authoritative by the Digambaras, who branched off from the parent stock about two centuries after the death of Mah\u0101v\u012bra\u2014the Antagada-das\u0101o and \u0100\u1e47uttaravavaiya-das\u0101o form the eighth and ninth Angas respectively. In themselves they have little literary merit. Their themes and their style are alike frigid, mechanical, and dreary in the extreme. But one or two stories and many of the minor details have a real intrinsic interest; several of the characters are historical; and, above all, their language\u2014the old M\u0101gadh\u012b Prakrit\u2014is a rich mine for the seeker of philological treasures. Some day, when the whole of the Jain scriptures will have been critically edited and their contents lexically tabulated together with their ancient glosses, they will throw many lights on the dark places of ancient and modern Indian languages and literature.\n\nOne of the most curious features of the Jain scriptures is the mechanical character of their verbal structure. A vast number of phrases, sentences, and whole periods recur again and again with mathematical regularity; but instead of being written out in full, they are usually abbreviated, the first and last words only being given, with the word java (\"until\") to denote the intermediate words; and often even this stenographic symbol is left out. In the following pages I have given the full translation of these omitted passages in square brackets when they occur for the first time; when they recur again, I have marked the abbreviation usually by three dots, and rarely by a literal rendering.\n\nThe same spirit of economy appears in the manner in which the Jain editors treat parallel stories. A consider-\n\n1 An analysis of both is given by the late Professor Weber in his Indische Studien, vol. xvi., and his Verzeichniss der Sanskrit und Pr\u0101krit-Handschriften of the Berlin Library.\nable number of the scriptural narratives being exact duplicates of one another, the reader often finds a tale broken off with the curt statement that he will find the rest of the story in another book, told of another person. Thus the story of Goyame in the first lesson of the Antagada-das\u0101o has to be pieced together from several sources. The text of the Antagada-das\u0101o gives it only as far as the dream of Dh\u0101rin\u012b; from that point to the list of wedding-presents it has to be taken, mutatis mutandis, from the Bhagavat\u012b, book xi.; then, after two short paragraphs taken respectively from the Antagada-das\u0101o and the Bhagavat\u012b, the N\u0101y\u0101-dhamma-kah\u0101 supplies the whole of the material until the taking of the vows; then the Antagada-das\u0101o gives a little more; and finally the rest of the tale until the conclusion is taken from the Bhagavat\u012b. For the story of Goyame I have translated the whole of these disjecta membra; in the later narratives the reader will be satisfied with a mere reference.\n\nAs yet the only Jain scriptures that have been critically edited are the Uv\u0101saga-das\u0101o, published by Dr. Hoernle, and the Ovav\u0101iya-das\u0101o, edited by Professor E. Leumann. It has therefore been necessary for me to constitute a provisional text of the following books from the materials at my disposal. These were, for the Antagada-das\u0101o, two manuscripts in the British Museum (Or. 2100 and 5129), and another kindly lent from the library of the Indian Institute at Oxford, together with a printed edition of little merit published at Calcutta in 1875 by Satyavrata S\u0101ma\u015bram\u012b, and an almost worthless lithograph that appeared at Bombay in 1893. The first, second, fourth, and fifth of these contain Gujarati glosses; the fourth has also the Sanskrit gloss ascribed to Abhayadeva. The materials for the Anuttaravav\u0101iya-das\u0101o are enumerated in Appendix I., in which I have been induced by the lexical interest of the story of Dhan\u1e47e to print the Prakrit text of the whole book in a tentative form.\n\nThe works to which reference is most frequently made in the notes are:\nBhag. = Bhagavat\u012b-s\u016btra, with Abhayadeva's Sanskrit commentary, a Gujarati paraphrase, and a partial Sanskrit interpretation, published at Benares in 1882.\n\nN\u0101y. = N\u0101y\u0101 - dhamma - kah\u0101 (Jn\u0101t\u0101 - dharma - kath\u0101\u1e25), edited with Abhayadeva's commentary and a Gujarati paraphrase at Calcutta in 1876.\n\nOv. = Ovav\u0101iya - das\u0101o (Ovav\u0101i, or Aupap\u0101tika - da\u015b\u0101\u1e25), edited by Professor Leumann in vol. viii. of the Abhandlungen of the Deutsche Morgenl\u00e4ndische Gesellschaft.\n\nUv\u0101s. = Uv\u0101saga-das\u0101o (Up\u0101saka-da\u015b\u0101\u1e25), edited by Dr. Hoernle in the Bibliotheca Indica.\n\nNa hi vandhy\u0101 vijan\u0101ti garbha-prasava-vedanam: only those who have worked in this field know how toilsome it is. Manuscripts, even the best of them, are full of corruptions and distortions of words; the words themselves, even when correctly transmitted, are often obscure, and for their interpretation we are in most cases dependent upon traditions which are sometimes doubtful and not seldom themselves obscure, especially when conveyed in crabbed archaic Gujarati. The consideration of these difficulties will, I hope, induce the reader to regard with some degree of indulgence the many shortcomings of this book.\n\nAnd lastly I would discharge a debt of gratitude to three friends. To Mr. F. W. Thomas the inception of this work is due; Dr. Hoernle, the honoured doyen of Jain studies in Europe, has read through the proofs and kindly sent me several important corrections and additional notes; and in the study of the vernacular glosses my colleague Professor Blumhardt has often lent me generous aid.\n\nGari\u1e63\u1e6dho \u2019py eva sauh\u0101rde layam eti pari\u015brama\u1e25.\nMah\u0101v\u012bra\u1e47i-jvalane k\u1e63\u012b\u1e47am karmeva du\u1e25k\u1e5btam.\nANTAGADA-DAS\u0100O.\n\nTHE FIRST CHAPTER.\n\nIn those days, at that time, there was a city named Camp\u0101.\u00b9\n\n\u00b2 It was splendid, tranquil, and prosperous. City folk and country folk alike were happy there. It was thronged with population. Its field-bounds were turned up by hundreds and thousands of ploughshares, and displayed far-reaching pleasant dykes.\u00b3 It abounded in troops of cocks and capons; it was full of sugar-cane, wheat, and rice crops; and it swarmed with oxen, buffaloes, and rams. Shapely\u2074 temples, tenanted by damsels, were plenteous therein.\u2075 It was free from bribers, torturers, brigands, robbers, and thief-takers, comfortable, and without offence. It was liberal in alms-giving, a home of secure and pleasant life,\u2076 dense with many millions of citizens, content and happy. It was haunted by actors, dancers, rope-walkers,\u2077\n\n\u00b9 The modern Champapur, near Bhagalpur.\n\n\u00b2 The following description is supplied from the Ovav\u0101i, \u00a7 1.

It was solidly built, and hard to enter by reason of discs, clubs, maces, barriers, drop-blocks,\\(^5\\) and double doors. It was surrounded by a wall bent in a curve like a bow, and decorated with cornices arranged in circles. Its bastions, rampart-paths, doorways, gates, and arches were lofty, its high-roads duly divided. Its gate-bars and bolts were stout, and fashioned by skilful artificers. It contained markets and bazaars thronged with craftsmen, content and happy. It had open places,\\(^6\\) junctions of three, four, or more roads,\\(^7\\) and markets for goods, adorned with divers sorts of treasures.\\(^8\\) It was very delightful. Its highways were thronged with princes. It was crowded with numbers of fine horses, fiery elephants, and troops of chariots, with palanquins\\(^9\\) and litters, and with cars and carriages. Its waters were brilliant with beds of lotuses whose buds were newly bursting into bloom, and it was fully decorated with fine white palaces. It was a sight to be looked upon with open eyes, comforting, pleasant to the gaze, agreeable and comely.\n\nOutside this city of Camp\u0101, to the north-east thereof, was a sanctuary named Pu\u1e47\u1e47abhadde.

It had umbrellas, banners, and bells; it had flags and flags upon flags to adorn it, and was provided with brushes.

There was in it great store of ritual pitchers. On its doorways were ritual jars and well fashioned arches. Broad rounded long-drooping masses of chaplets lay in it below and above; and it was filled with appertaining bunches of fresh sweet-smelling blossoms of the five colours scattered therein. It smelt pleasantly with the shimmering reek from incense of k\u0101l\u0101guru, fine kundurukka, and turukka, and was odorous with sweet-smelling fine scents, a very incense-wafer. It was haunted by actors, dancers, rope-walkers, wrestlers, boxers, jesters, jumpers, reciters, ballad-singers, story-tellers, pole-dancers, picture-showmen, pipers, lute-players, snake-charmers, and minstrels. Its fame was widely spread among many populations of town and country. It was meet for the prayers and supplications of many prayerful folk; meet for worship, celebration, veneration, offering, largesse, and respect; meet to be waited upon with\n\n1 Vittie, either \u2018possessing substance,\u2019 or \u2018giving a livelihood to those under its protection.\u2019 There is a variant kittie, \u2018famous.\u2019\n\n2 Loma-hattha, the brushes (usually bunches of peacocks\u2019 feathers) for wiping the road and seats, so that the devotee may not tread or sit upon vermin, and so do harm to a living thing.\n\n3 Black, white, blue, yellow, and red.\n\n4 K\u0101l\u0101guru is the Agaru agallochum; kundurukka is Boswellia thurifera (B. serrata); turukka (Sanskrit turu\u1e63ka) is either Liqui-dambar orientale (\u015bihlaka, vernacularly \u015bil\u0101ras), or Schrebera swietenioides (Sanskrit gha\u1e47\u1e6d\u0101p\u0101\u1e6dala), or the resin of Pinus longifolia (Sanskrit \u015br\u012bv\u0101sa).\n\n5 So the Gujarati version.

Many people came to worship the sanctuary Pu\u1e47\u1e47abhadde.\\(^2\\)\n\nThis sanctuary Pu\u1e47\u1e47abhadde was encompassed round about by a great wood. This wood was black and of black lustre, blue and of blue lustre, green and of green lustre, cool and of cool lustre, soft and of soft lustre, warm and of warm lustre; black and of black shadow, blue and of blue shadow, green and of green shadow, cool and of cool shadow, soft and of soft shadow, warm and of warm shadow, of thickly-matted shadow, pleasant, like a mass of mighty clouds.\n\nThe trees thereof were right of tap-roots, upper roots, stems, bark, branches, boughs, leaves, flowers, fruit, and seed; well grown in due order, agreeable, and ripened into roundness. They had single stems, many branches, many boughs, lesser boughs, and twigs. They had thick, broad, round trunks that could not be compassed by the full extent of many fathoms.\\(^3\\) They had leaves neither bitten into holes, nor thinly set, nor drooping,\\(^4\\) nor blighted; and the outworn yellow foliage was swept away from them. Deep with the gloom of the masses of their fresh green glistening leafage, they were a goodly sight. Their fine sprouting tips were adorned with fresh young leaf-buds issuing thence, with soft and brilliant quivering shoots,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Saccov\u0101; the Comm. explains as saty\u0101bhil\u0101\u1e63a, \u2018surely satisfying desire,\u2019 or satya-seva, \u2018surely repaying service.\u2019 It may also mean, as the Guj. suggests, satya-up\u0101ya, \u2018sure in effecting its ends\u2019; this is supported by the doublet sacca-papahave.\n\n\\(^2\\) Reading \u0101gamma pu\u1e47\u1e47abhadda-ceiyam pu\u1e47\u1e47abhadda-ceiyam.

It was very delightful. It swarmed with crowds of wanton humble-bees and honey-bees; reckless bees, hiding themselves in desire of the sap of its flowers, filled its regions with sweet hummings and murmurings. Its trees had their flowers and fruit within, shaded over by leaves without, or were shaded over and about by leaves and flowers. Its fruits were sweet. No sickness dwelt in it. Delightfully adorned with manifold thickets, bushes, and bowers, it formed as it were divers brilliant banners. By its ponds, lotus-pools, and lakes it had delightful trellis-houses duly set. Its trees poured forth a great wealth of odour massed and far-spreading,\\(^3\\) sweet of scent, splendid, fragrant, and charming. They were full of manifold thickets, bushes, bowers, and arbours, handsome banks and banners, and gave room to many chariots, cars, carriages, and litters. They were very delightful, comforting, pleasant to the gaze, agreeable, and comely.\n\n\\(^1\\) Uncertain; the text has m\u0101iy\u0101, which Abhayadeva wildly glosses by may\u016brita. Perhaps it is the Sanskrit m\u0101dit\u0101\u1e25; cf. Chh\u0101nd. Upanishad VI. xi. 1, modam\u0101nas ti\u1e63\u1e6dhati, of a tree.

His engine-stores, treasuries, granaries, and arsenals were full. He was strong, his rivals weak; and he ruled a kingdom where rebels were smitten, beaten, shattered, cast out, and were not; where foes were smitten, beaten, shattered, cast out, defeated, overcome; whence famine had vanished and fear of pestilence had fled; peaceful, blissful, well fed, and at rest from inroads and tumults.] Here he held sway over Samuddavijae and the rest of the ten Das\u0101ras, over Baladeve and the rest of the five great heroes, over Pajjunne and the rest of the three and a half crores of princes, over Sambe and the rest of the 60,000 fighting men, over Mah\u0101se\u1e47e and the rest of the 56,000 mighty\n\n---\n\n1 The signs of royalty apparent as birth-marks on his limbs\u2014*e.g.*, the *svastika* cross.\n2 *Muddh\u0101bhisisitte*, said to mean \u2018anointed in due order of succession by his predecessor.\u2019\n3 As performing lustratory rites (*\u015banti*) for the people.\n4 The \u2018banks\u2019 (*seu*) are explained as the right course of life, *m\u0101rga*; the \u2018banners\u2019 betoken his exploits.\n5 Viz., in almsgiving and entertainment.\nmen, over Vi\u015basena and the rest of the 21,000 warriors, over Uggasena and the rest of the 16,000 kings, over Ruppi\u1e47\u012b and the rest of the 16,000 queens, over A\u1e47an-gase\u1e47\u0101 and the rest of the many thousands of courtesans, and over many kings, princes, barons, [prefects, mayors, bankers, traders, captains,] merchants, and others, over the city of B\u0101rava\u012b and the whole of the southern half of Bh\u0101rahe-v\u0101se.\n\nIn this city of B\u0101rava\u012b dwelt King Andhaga-van\u1e6dh\u012b, great as great Himavat...

Her waist was to be clasped by the hand, and marked with a comely threefold dimple; her face was stainless as the moon in K\u0101rttika, perfect, and sweet. Her cheeks were set off with earrings. Charming as an abode of Love was her attire.

The word padipun\u1e47a, rendered 'perfect,' has here, as often, the physical meaning of 'rounded.'\n3 The tokens, lakkh\u0101\u1e47a, are the birthmarks (svastika cross, discus, etc.), presaging fortune; the signs of distinction, vanj\u0101\u1e47a, are the painting of the eyes with collyrium, of the brow with vermilion, etc., denoting actual rank and dignity.\n4 Gand\u0101-leh\u0101: the Sanskrit gand\u0101-lekh\u0101 is glossed as gand\u0101-sthala by Mallin\u0101tha on Kum\u0101ra-sambhava, vii. 82.\n5 Or, 'her attire was of ravishing appearance and delightful.'\nNow it befell once that the Queen Dh\u0101r\u012b\u1e47\u012b was [in a chamber of this sort: it was well figured with pictures within, and was white, polished, and smooth without; its ceiling was variously figured and its floor glistening; it dispelled darkness by its gems and jewels, and its space was duly divided in manifold wise; it was filled with appertaining bunches of fresh, sweet-smelling blossoms of the five colours scattered therein; it smelt pleasantly with the shimmering reek from incense of k\u0101l\u0101guru, fine kundurukka, and turukka, and was odorous with sweet-smelling fine scents, a very incense-wafer. And she lay] on a couch of this sort: [it had a mattress of meet size for her stature, and was cushioned on either end, high on either side, and deep in the middle, like as one sinks in the sands of the shore of Ganges; it was draped with featly spun coverings of gauzy fine linen,\\(^2\\) with a well made curtain, and was cloaked by red silk; it was very delightful, and felt as though it were of deer-skin, of r\u016bta, of b\u016bra, of butter, or of t\u016bla, and was filled with fine sweet-smelling flowers, powders, and other appurtenances of a couch. At midnight, as she lay tossing about midway between sleeping and waking, she beheld this noble, happy, blissful, lucky, auspicious, splendid great dream, and then awoke\u2014to wit, she beheld in a dream a lion of great whiteness as of pearl, silver, the Ocean of Milk, the moon\u2019s beams, water, the Great Silver Mountain,\\(^3\\) mighty, pleasant, and\n\n\\(^1\\) The whole of the following story, down to the end of the list of wedding-gifts, is given as published in the Bhagavat\u012b, book xi., \u00a7 11 (Benares edition, fol. 940 et seq.), and the connected passages. The Antagada-das\u0101o merely gives the rubric, *In the same wise as Mahabale, the dream, narrative, birth, childhood, accomplishments, youth, marriage, damsels, palaces, and enjoyments, except that his name was Goyame, and they gave him in marriage on one day eight noble princesses; the gifts were eight of each kind.*\n\n\\(^2\\) Khomiy\u0101-dugulla, in Sanskrit k\u1e63aumika-duk\u016bla, said by the Comm. to signify pairs of coverings of fine cotton or flaxen fabric; on fol. 962, however, he says that dugulla (duk\u016bla) is made from tree-bark, distinguishing it from khoma, flaxen or cotton stuff.\n\n\\(^3\\) Explained as meaning Mount Vait\u0101\u1e0dhya. There are however several of this name in Jain cosmography (see Appendix). Two are\ngoodly to look upon, whose fore-legs were firm and comely, whose mouth displayed round, thick, close-fitting, excellent, sharp teeth, whose lips were tender and fully proportioned, glistening and comely as a perfected noble lotus, whose palate and tongue were soft and delicate as petals of a red lotus, whose eyes were as fine gold heated in crucibles of eddy-like roundness, and stainless as lightning, and even, whose thighs were broad and stout, and whose shoulders were full and wide, who was adorned with soft, brilliant, delicate, elegant, and spreading mane-locks, whose tail was high, well framed, well formed, and sweeping the ground, who was sweet and of sweet aspect, and who played and sported, and then coming down from the sky passed into her mouth; then she awoke. Then Queen Dh\u0101r\u012b\u1e47\u012b, having beheld in her sleep this noble . . . great dream and awakened, became glad [and joyful of spirit, pleased of mind, exceedingly cheerful, and her heart was moved by gladness], and the root-cells of her hair swelled like kadamba-flowers beaten by rain-showers. She took cognisance of the dream, and rose up from her couch, and went to the place where King Andhaga-vanhi\u2019s couch was, not speeding nor hastening, with a gait neither hurried nor lagging, like that of a royal hamsa. Then addressing King Andhaga-vanhi with these agreeable, lovely, dear, acceptable, pleasant, noble, happy, blissful, lucky, auspicious, fortunate, soft, sweet, and tender words, she awakened him; and being given leave by him, she sat down on a throne figured with patterns of divers gems and jewels. Sitting in a perfectly comfortable posture, restful and composed, she addressed him with these agreeable . . . words, saying:\n\n\u201cTruly, Beloved of the Gods, to-day on a couch of this sort, meet for my stature . . . I beheld in a dream a lion\n\nridges running across Bharata-var\u1e63a and Air\u0101vata-var\u1e63a; another consists of two parallel ranges in Videha; other Vait\u0101\u1e0dhyas are the mountains around which the great rivers turn at right angles; and yet others exist on other continents around Jamb\u016bdv\u012bpa.\n\n1 A standing phrase; cf. Bhag., fol. 156, etc,\n\nA. D.\n... passing into my mouth, and awoke. Now, Beloved of the Gods, what kind of happy issue, I wonder, will there be of this noble ... great dream?\"\n\nThen King Andhaga-vanhi, listening and hearing this matter of Queen Dh\u0101rin\u012b, became glad and joyful ... and his body bristled like the sweet-scented flowers of the n\u012bpa beaten by rain-showers, and his hairs rose up in their root-cells. He took cognisance of the dream, entered into inquiry thereupon, and by his own native faculty of intelligence arising from perception\\(^1\\) he grasped the purport of the dream. Then he addressed Queen Dh\u0101rin\u012b with these agreeable ... auspicious, soft, sweet, and fortunate [words], saying:\n\n\"Noble is the dream thou hast seen, O queen! happy the dream thou hast seen, O queen! ... fortunate the dream thou hast seen, O queen! fraught with health, delight, long life, happiness, and good auspices the dream thou hast seen, 'O queen! There shall be winning of purpose, Beloved of the Gods, winning of enjoyment, winning of a son, winning of empire. Truly, Beloved of the Gods, after the passing of nine full months and seven and a half days and nights thou shalt bear a boy, a banner to our stock, a lamp to our stock, a mountain to our stock, a crown to our stock, an ornament to our stock, a glory-winner to our stock, a joy-winner to our stock, a renown-winner to our stock, a foundation to our stock, a tree to our stock, a maker of increase to our stock, delicate of hands and feet, his body perfect and in no wise lacking in its five organs of sense ... sweet of aspect as the moon, lovely and pleasant to behold, goodly of form, like in brilliance to a young god. This boy, his childhood spent, so soon as he shall have come to judgment and ripeness and entered the way of youth, will be a hero, a warrior, a valiant man, a lord of empire, yea, a king, possessing ample and abundant hosts and waggons. Thus noble ... fraught with health, delight ... and good auspices is the dream thou hast seen, O queen.\"\n\n\\(^1\\) See Appendix.\nThus with these agreeable . . . [words] twice and thrice he spoke comfortably to Queen Dh\u0101r\u012b\u1e47\u012b. Then Queen Dh\u0101r\u012b\u1e47\u012b, having listened and heard this matter from King Andhaga-van\u1e6dh\u012b, became glad and joyful . . . [raised to her head her hands clasped before her forehead with joined] palms, and said: \u2018It is so, Beloved of the Gods; it is true, it is assured, it is beyond doubt, it is agreeable, it is acceptable, it is agreeable and acceptable, it is as thou sayest.\u2019\n\nThus she duly accepted the dream, and being given leave by King Andhaga-van\u1e6dh\u012b, she arose from the fine couch figured with patterns of divers gems and jewels, and went to the place where her own couch was, not speeding nor hastening . . . Then she sat down on her couch and said: \u201cLet not this my sublime, exalted, auspicious dream be marred by other ill dreams!\u201d So with excellent, auspicious, and devout discourses touching eminent persons\u00b9 she kept herself awake in vigil to her dream.\n\nThen King Andhaga-van\u1e6dh\u012b summoned the chamberlains, and said: \u201cMake haste, Beloved of the Gods, to do your part and have to-day the whole outer audience-chamber sprinkled with perfumed water, cleansed, swept, and smeared, filled with appertaining sweet-scented fine blossoms of the five colours . . . a very incense-wafer.

Then they made haste to do their part, and . . . brought back the report of [his command].\n\n\u00b9 See Hoernle\u2019s translation of Uv\u0101s., p. 94, note.\n\u00b2 A standing phrase, mama eyam \u0101nattiyam paccappi\u1e47aha; literally, \u2018bring back this my order\u2019\u2014i.e., \u2018report it to have been executed.\u2019\n\u00b3 A regular \u2018tag.\u2019\nThen King Andhaga-vanhi at break of day rose up from his couch, and stepped down from the da\u00efs. He went to the place where the gymnasium was, and entered into the gymnasium. [1 There he wearied, tired, and forspent himself with manifold exercises of energy, leaping, limb-twisting, wrestling, and turning; then he was smeared with anointing stuffs of a hundred and a thousand distillations, fragrant oils and the like, comforting, inspiriting, gladdening, strengthening, rejoicing all the organs and limbs; then on the oiling-skin he was rubbed down by men with tender and delicate palms on perfect hands and feet, men skilful, dexterous, accomplished, clever, wise, possessed of cunning art, masters of the modes of anointing, rubbing, and turning, with fourfold rubbing pleasant to the bones, to the flesh, to the skin, and to the hair. Then, when his faintness and fatigue were gone, he stepped out of the gymnasium, and went to the place where the bath-house was, and entered into the bath-house. There, in a delightful bath-chamber, entirely covered with lattice-work and pleasant, and floored with divers gems and jewels, he sat comfortably upon a bath-da\u00efs figured with patterns in divers gems and jewels, and was bathed with pure waters, with scented waters, with flower-waters, and with holy waters again and again, according to the rule of happy and excellent bathing. When the happy and excellent bathing had been brought to an end with hundreds of manifold charm-wrappings, his body was rubbed with downy soft cloths dyed with fragrant saffron. His limbs were smeared with fresh, sweet-scented go\u015b\u012br\u1e63a sandal. A perfect and noble robe of great price was wrapped round him. A pure chaplet and an adorning unguent were put upon him. Gems and gold were hung\n\n---\n\n1 This passage, as far as the entrance into the audience-chamber, is as given in the Ovav\u0101\u012b, \u00a7 48 (p. 184 et seq. of the Calcutta edition), to which the Bhag. refers by a short rubric.\n\n2 Anega-v\u0101y\u0101ma-jogga-vagg\u0101na-v\u0101maddana-malla-juddha-karanehi\u1e43; jogga is glossed as gu\u1e47anik\u0101, karay\u0101ni as \u2018kinds of limb-bending well known in text-books of wrestling.\u2019\n\n3 Or \u2018pleasant.\u2019\naround him. A seemly splendour was given him by wearing h\u0101ras, half-h\u0101ras,\\(^1\\) and triple rows of jewels, pendent jewels, and drooping sashes. Neck-chains and rings were fastened upon him, and charming ornaments of his charming body. His arms became, as it were, stiff with noble rings and bracelets. He was brilliant with exceeding beauty, his fingers ruddy with signet-rings, his face aglitter with earrings, his head agleam from his crown, his breast featly adorned with the covering of pearl-ropes, his upper robe featly formed of long drooping silks. Manly bracelets were fastened upon him, closely fitting, excellent, and delightful, framed of divers gems, gold, and jewels, pure, precious, cunningly wrought, and glistering.\n\nIn short\u2014ornamented and decked like the Tree of Desire, with an umbrella garlanded with korenta flowers held over him, his body fanned by the sweep of four yak-tail fans, while at the sight of him arose festive cries of 'Victory!' surrounded by many sheriffs, officers of police, kings, princes, barons, prefects, mayors, bankers, traders, captains, merchants, commissioners, and treaty-agents, and like the moon issuing from a great white cloud in the midst of the troop of planets, the glittering constellations, and the troop of the stars] pleasant of aspect, the king came forth from the bath-house, and went to the place where was the outer audience-chamber, and sat down upon a fine throne fronting the east. To the north-eastern side of himself he caused to be set up eight fair seats covered with white cloths, with the auspicious appurtenance of white mustard. Not too near and not too far from himself he caused to be spread an inner curtain\\(^2\\) adorned with divers\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The term h\u0101ra is here explained as a combination of eighteen strings (sara) of jewels. The term p\u0101lamba, here rendered 'pendent jewels,' is immediately below glossed by the Comm. as 'long,' applied to silks.\n\n\\(^2\\) Javaniy\u0101, Sanskrit javanik\u0101, a word which by its etymology (\u1f38\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae) points to Greek culture. Weber holds that it originally denoted the curtain of the Hellenistic theatre (Indische Studien, xvi. 38). This, however, is not necessary. The woollen fabrics of Ionia, and especially of Miletus, were widely exported in very early times,\ngems and jewels, exceedingly comely and precious, brought from a noble workshop,\\(^1\\) having threads of delicate fabric and figured in hundreds of patterns, figured with patterns of wolves and bulls; and there he caused to be set for Queen Dh\u0101r\u012b\u1e47\u012b a fair seat figured with patterns in divers gems and jewels, draped with an over-cloth and soft pillow, covered with white robes, pleasant of touch to the body, very soft. Then he summoned his chamberlains, and said: \u201cMake haste, Beloved of the Gods, to summon the masters of the rules and purport of the eightfold\\(^2\\) great lore of divination, the men skilful in divers books of art, the readers of the tokens of dreams.\u201d\n\nThen the chamberlains . . . promised obedience . . . and left the presence of King Andhaga-vanhi. Swiftly, quickly, speedily, rapidly, hastily they went forth into the midst of the city of B\u0101rava\u012b, and took their way toward the houses of the readers of the tokens of dreams, and summoned them. Then the readers of the tokens of dreams, being summoned by King Andhaga-vanhi\u2019s chamberlains, became glad and joyful. They bathed themselves, held the domestic sacrifice,\\(^3\\) performed the lustratory rites of charm and auspicious mark, put on festive clean garments of state, and decked their bodies\n\nboth for wearing-apparel and for curtains, etc.; and as the word javanik\u0101 in its earliest use does not necessarily signify curtains of a theatre, it is probable that it meant originally nothing more than \u2018Ionian curtains,\u2019 and may even date from the days before the fall of Miletus.\n\n\\(^1\\) Varapattan\u2019-uggaya: the Comm. optionally renders it as varavastrotpatti-sth\u0101na-sambhav\u0101, or as pradh\u0101na-vestanakud udgata.\n\n\\(^2\\) The Comm. in explanation quotes an \u0101ry\u0101 verse\u2014attha nimitta\u1e45g\u0101m divv\u2019-upp\u0101y\u2019-antalikkha-bhomam caa\u1e45gam sara-lakkha\u1e47a-vanjanam ca tivih\u0101m pu\u1e47\u2019 ekkek\u0101m.\n\n\\(^3\\) The bali-karma.\n\n\\(^4\\) A common passage; cf.

Kouv\u0101, \u2018charm,\u2019 signifies the painting of the eyes with collyrium and of the brow with vermilion; mangala, \u2018auspicious mark,\u2019 refers to the application of white mustard, rice-grains, curds, sandal-powder, etc., to the forehead.\nwith ornaments of small and great price\\(^1\\). Then, with their heads auspiciously marked with white mustard and d\u016brv\u0101 grass,\\(^2\\) they went forth from their own houses and betook themselves into the midst of the city of B\u0101rava\u012b, toward King Andhaga-vanhi\u2019s noble palace. At the doorway of the noble palace they came together, and then they took their way toward the outer audience-chamber, toward King Andhaga-vanhi, [raised to their heads their hands with joined] palms, and cried to King Andhaga-vanhi, \u2018Victory! triumph!\u2019 Thereupon the readers of the tokens of dreams, reverently hailed, worshipped, entertained, and honoured by King Andhaga-vanhi, sat down on the fair seats already set for each. Then King Andhaga-vanhi made Queen Dh\u0101rin\u012b sit behind the curtain, and holding a handful of flowers and fruit, spoke thus with exceeding courtesy to the readers of the tokens of dreams:\n\n\u201cTruly, Beloved of the Gods, Queen Dh\u0101rin\u012b to-day in a chamber of this sort . . . beheld in a dream a lion . . . and awoke.

They took cognisance of the dream, entered into inquiry thereupon, and grasped the purport of the dream. Thereupon they took counsel one with the other, and thus having obtained, grasped, inquired, determined, and understood the purport of the dream, they declared the purport thereof before King Andhaga-vanhi, saying:\n\n\u201cTruly, Beloved of the Gods, we have found in our books of dream-lore forty-two dreams, thirty great dreams, seventy-two dreams in all.

She nourished herself according to place and time with substances neither too chill, nor too hot, nor too acrid, nor too pungent, nor too astringent, nor too sour,\nnor too sweet, but pleasant in seasonable use, with food, covering, perfumes, and garlands, such as were good for the unborn babe, moderate, wholesome, nutritious for the unborn babe; using special and soft beds and couches, staying in pleasantly retired and agreeable places of abode, her longings excellent, her longings fulfilled, duly honoured, entirely gratified, dispelled, and removed, free from sickness, sorrow, delusion, dread, and terror, she comfortably carried the unborn babe. Then, after the passing of nine months and seven and a half days and nights, Queen Dh\u0101r\u012b\u1e47\u012b bore a boy delicate of hands and feet, his body perfect and in no wise lacking in its five organs of sense, excellent in the marks of distinction and tokens . . . sweet of aspect as the moon, lovely and pleasant to behold, goodly of form. Then Queen Dh\u0101r\u012b\u1e47\u012b\u2019s chamber-women, seeing that she had born a child, went toward King Andhaga-van\u1e25\u012b, and [raised to their heads their hands with joined] palms, and cried to King Andhaga-van\u1e25\u012b, \u201cVictory! triumph!\u201d saying, \u201cTruly, Beloved of the Gods, Queen Dh\u0101r\u012b\u1e47\u012b after nine full months . . . has born a boy . . . This joyful matter for thy joy we announce to thee, Beloved of the Gods; be it a joy for thee!\u201d\n\nThen King Andhaga-van\u1e25\u012b, listening and hearing this matter from the chamber-women, became glad and joyful . . . [his body bristled], like the flowers of the n\u012bpa beaten by rain-showers [and his hairs rose up] in their root-cells. He gave to the chamber-women all the ornaments that he was wearing save his diadem. Then he took a bright silver pitcher full of pure water and bathed their heads, bestowed a liberal gift of gladness of lifelong worth, gave them largesse and honour, and sent them away. Then King Andhaga-van\u1e25\u012b summoned his chamberlains, and said: \u201cMake haste, Beloved of the Gods, to release the prisoners in the city of B\u0101ravai, and increase the measures of volume, weight, and length; then do your part, and have the city of B\u0101ravai within and without sprinkled, swept, and smeared . . . set up a thousand posts, a thousand discs, and festival entertainment of\ngreat magnificence, then bring back the report of this my command.\"\n\nThe chamberlains, thus bidden by King Andhaga-vanhi... brought back the report. Then King Andhaga-vanhi went toward the audience-chamber (repeat the same account as above, until) he came forth from the bath-house.\n\nAnd then for ten days he held a birthday-festival\\(^1\\) for the people of town and country, in which there was no payment of tolls or taxes, no husbandry, no selling, no weighing, no entrance of constables, no fine nor exaction, no pressing of debt; excellent women of pleasure and play-actors thronged in it, numbers of clappers haunted it, drums were never cast aside and chaplets never faded in it, and joy and merriment ruled. While this birthday-festival of ten days was going on, King Andhaga-vanhi gave by his own hand and through others hundreds, thousands, and hundreds of thousands of sacrifices, largesses, and portions, and received himself and bestowed on others hundreds, thousands, and hundreds of thousands of gifts. So the boy's father and mother on the first day held a birthday festival; on the third day they held a holiday on the sight of the moon and sun; on the sixth day they kept a vigil; when the eleventh day was past, the lustratory birth-rites finished,\\(^2\\) and the twelfth day come, they caused to be prepared abundant food, drink, sweetmeats, and dainties, and summoned [friends, kinsfolk, men of their own family and stock, relations, retainers, kings, and] nobles. Thereupon they bathed themselves, held [the domestic sacrifice, performed the lustratory rites of charm and auspicious mark, put on festive clean garments of state, and decked their bodies with ornaments of great and small price.

After this list of notables the Comm. supplies a description of the various purposes, costumes, etc., of the crowd, which the text of the N\u0101y. ignores.\n\n\\(^4\\) In Jain legend the Mallakis and Lecchakis (or Licchavis) appear as two confederate clans ruling around K\u0101\u015b\u012b and Kosala respectively,\nand many other kings, princes . . . and others, with great and loud roars, cries, babble, and shouting,] went forth into the midst of the city of B\u0101rava\u012b by the same way, in the same direction. Now Prince Goyame sat up in his noble palace . . . looking down upon the high-road. He saw many Ugras . . . going forth by the same way, in the same direction. He summoned a waiting-man, and said: \"Beloved of the Gods, is there to-day in the city of B\u0101rava\u012b a feast of Indra, or of Skanda, or of Rudra, \u015aiva, Vai\u015bravana, N\u0101gas, or Fairies, or ghosts, or of the ponds, trees, shrines, or hills, or a pilgrimage to parks or mountains, that the Ugras . . . are going forth by the same way, in the same direction?\"\n\nThen the waiting-man, having learned the news of the coming of the Saint, said to Prince Goyame: \"Beloved of the Gods, there is to-day in the city of B\u0101rava\u012b no feast . . . that the Ugras . . . are going forth by the same way, in the same direction; but truly, Beloved of the Gods, the Saint has come here . . .\"\n\nThen Prince Goyame, hearing and learning this matter from the waiting-man, became glad and joyful. He summoned chamberlains, and bade them make haste to harness a four-belled horse-chariot. They promised, and brought it. Then Prince Goyame bathed . . . decked himself with all his ornaments, mounted the four-belled horse-chariot, and with an umbrella garlanded with kore\u1e47\u1e6da-flowers held over him, escorted by a numerous attendant throng of great warriors, he went forth into the midst of the city of B\u0101rava\u012b. He took his way towards the park of Nandanava\u1e47e, and there beheld umbrellas upon umbrellas and banners upon banners for the Saint, and Vidy\u0101dharas, celestial singers, and Jambhaya gods,\u00b9 flying\n\n\u00b9 Deities of the tiryag-loka (our world, distinguished from the world above it and the world below).\ndown and flying up. Then he alighted from the four-belled horse-chariot, and approached the Saint in the fivefold manner of approach\\(^1\\)\u2014to wit, with surrender of things that have mind, with surrender of things that have no mind, with wearing of a single robe as upper garment, with clasping of the hands at touch of sight, and with concentration of thought. Thus he approached the Saint, thrice walked around him from right to right, praised and worshipped him, and courteously waited with clasped hands before him, neither very near nor very far, wishful to hear him and worshipping. Then the Saint before Prince Goyame and this mighty congregation preached various doctrine.\\(^2\\) (Here are to be recited the sermons as to how souls are fettered and released and afflicted,\\(^3\\) until) \u201cthe congregation went back. Then Prince Goyame, having listened and heard the doctrine from the Saint, became glad and joyful... thrice walked around him from right to right, praised and worshipped him, and said: \u201cI believe in the Niggantha doctrine, sir; I accept it; I am delighted with it; I undertake the Niggantha doctrine, sir. It is so, sir; it is true, it is assured; it is agreeable, it is acceptable, sir, it is agreeable and acceptable, sir, it is as thou sayest. But now, Beloved of the Gods, I will say farewell to my father and mother, and then shave my head and go into the Order.\\(^4\\) If it please thee, Beloved of the Gods, make no stay.\u201d\n\nThen Prince Goyame, having praised and worshipped the Saint, went towards his four-belled horse-chariot, mounted it, and with his numerous throng of great warriors took his way toward his own house in the midst of the city of B\u0101rava\u012b. There he alighted from his four-belled chariot, went to the place where his father and mother were, did obeisance at their feet, and said: \u201cTruly, father and\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Abhigama.

Now I am fain, with your leave, father and mother, to shave my head before the Saint and go from household life into the Order of homeless friars.\"\n\nThereupon Queen Dh\u0101r\u012b\u1e47\u012b, having listened and heard this unpleasing, unlovely, unkind, unacceptable, unwinsome, never-before-heard, harsh utterance, was overcome by a great grief of spirit for her son, of this wise. Her limbs became dripping wet with sweat arising in the hair-cells; her members shook with the burden of anguish; her face grew lustreless, woeful, and downcast; her body became faint and powerless in an instant, like a lotus-wreath crushed in the palm of the hand; she became void of loveliness, and without brilliance and splendour; her ornaments became loose, her lustrous bracelets fell off, slipped down, and broke to pieces; her upper robe dropped away; her delicate tresses grew dishevelled; her sense vanishing in a swoon, she grew heavy, and, like a campaka-creeper lopped down by an axe, or like a flag-staff of Indra\\(^1\\) whereof the joining bonds are unloosed when the festival is past, she fell with a crash in a heap upon the floor. The harem-attendants speedily besprinkled her and cooled her limbs with a pure shower of cool water issuing from the mouth of a golden pitcher, which they hastily poured out, and refreshed her with breezes aroused by swaying hand-fans of palm-leaf and bearing water-drops. Then, besprinkling her breasts with showers of tears that\n\n\\(^1\\) The custom of raising a flagstaff at the festivals of Indra may be traced back to the Rigveda, I. x. 1.\nfell like strings of pearls, pitiful, downcast, and woeful, weeping, wailing, pining, sorrowing, lamenting, she thus spoke to Prince Goyame:\n\n\"Child, thou art our only son, agreeable, beloved, dear, winsome, acceptable, sturdy, trustworthy, esteemed, honoured, approved, like a casket of treasures, delightful,\\(^1\\) peer of jewels, inspiring our life, gladdening our hearts, rare as the udumbara\\(^2\\) blossom even for hearing, much more for seeing. Truly, child, we shall not bear even for a moment severance from thee. Enjoy the full delights of mortal love, child, as long as we live; and afterward, when we shall have passed away, and thou shalt be ripe of age and concerned no longer for the task of carrying onward the succession of the line of our stock, thou shalt shave thy head before the Saint, and go from household life into the Order of homeless friars.\"\n\nThus bidden by his father and mother, Prince Goyame said to them:\n\n\"It is in sooth as you tell me, father and mother, that I am your only son . . . and afterward, when you shall have passed away, and I shall be ripe of age and concerned no longer for the task of carrying onward the succession of the line of our stock, I should shave my head before the Saint and go into the Order. But truly, father and mother, mortal life is unsure, undetermined, inconstant, overwhelmed by the assaults of vice, mobile as the lightning-flash, unstable as a bubble of water, like to a water-drop upon the spike of a grass-haulm, like to the flush of the evening sky, like to the vision of a dream, subject to dissolution by rot or fall, sooner or later perforce to be abandoned.

I should go into the Order. But in sooth, father and mother, the delights of mortal love are impure, inconstant, streaming with vomit, gall, slime, seed, and blood, foul in inward and outward breath, filled with hideous urine, dung, and pus, born of faeces, urine, slime, water, mucus, vomit, gall, seed, and blood; unsure, undetermined, inconstant, subject to dissolution by rot or fall, sooner or later perforce to be abandoned. Who knows, father and mother, who is to go first, who is to go last?

Now, child, enjoy the full store of rich entertainment meet for man; and afterward, when thou hast had the enjoyment of thy fortune . . . go into the Order.\"\n\nBut Prince Goyame said to them: \"It is in sooth as you tell me, father and mother, that here is very much gold . . . and afterward . . .

Therefore I am fain . . . to go into the Order.\"\n\nThen the father and mother of Prince Goyame, having prevailed not upon him by many declarations, discourses, addresses, and entreaties in accord with sense-enjoyment, now spoke to him in discourses on the contrary of sense-enjoyment, arousing fear and horror of discipline: \"Child, the Niggantha doctrine is true, sublime, absolute, perfect, rational, pure; it cuts out arrows; it is a path of success, a path of salvation, a path of issue, a path of extinction, a path void of all grief. It is single in its view, as a snake\\(^1\\); single of edge, like a razor\\(^2\\); as barley-corns of iron to chew; tasteless as mouthfuls of sand\\(^3\\); like the great river Ganges if one would go against its current; hard to traverse as the ocean to swim.

I should go into the Order. In sooth, father and mother, the Niggantha doctrine is hard to observe for feeble fearful wights that cling to this world, and thirst not for the world beyond, for the vulgar folk; but for the valiant man there is naught hard therein to do.

He washed his hands and feet in fragrant perfumed water, wrapped his face in a clean cloth, and with exceeding care cut off the ends of Prince Goyame\u2019s hair . . . Then the mother of Prince Goyame received the ends of his hair in a precious swan-figured robe, washed them in fragrant perfumed water, poured over them fresh go\u015bir\u1e63a-sandal, tied them up in a white cloth, laid them in a jewel-casket, laid this in a box, and then, pouring forth tears like strings of jewels, showers of rain, or sinduv\u0101ra blossoms, or broken pearl-ropes, weeping, wailing, and lamenting, spoke thus: \u201cLo, this is our last sight of Prince Goyame in high estate, in festivals, in births, in tithis, in holidays, in sacrifices, in days of the moon\u2019s change.\u201d Then she laid it down beneath a cushion.\n\nNow Prince Goyame\u2019s father and mother made ready a throne descending towards the north.

Then King Andhaga-vanhi summoned the chamberlains, and said: \"Make haste, Beloved of the Gods, promptly, swiftly, and speedily bring hither a litter of a thousand men's burden...\" And the chamberlains, glad and joyful... brought it.

After these there went in front, in due order, many bearers of staves, pikes, bows, yak-tails, nooses, books, boards, stools, lyres, oil-jars, and caskets. After these there went in front, in due order, many wand-bearers,\\(^1\\) shavelings, wearers of hair-crests and hair-tufts,\\(^2\\) bearers of peacock's tails,\\(^3\\) jesters, hubbub-makers, sayers of soft speech, love-players, jokers, buffoons, merry-men, reciting, singing, dancing, talking, holding forth, watching, and observing, and uttering cries of \"Victory! victory!\" After these there went in front, in due order, 108 fine high-bred horses, of the age possessed of speed, with eyes like harimel\u0101\\(^4\\) buds or jasmine, with active, lively, swift gait of springing tread, graceful tread, and prance,\\(^5\\) trained to speed of pace in leaping, springing, galloping, trotting, and three-foot walk, wearing goodly ornaments bound and swinging gracefully on their necks,\\(^6\\) brilliant\\(^7\\) with mouth-ornaments, tassels, and roundels,\\(^8\\) decked on the hips with the rods of yak-tail fans, and led by goodly young lackeys.

In Jain literature, at all events, it seems to mean 'rounds' like mirrors.

In the K\u0101dambar\u012b (p. 18 of Parab's edition) sth\u0101saka seems from the context to signify round patches (of saffron daubing); and from this may be derived the meaning (sth\u0101saka = hasta-bimba) found in Sanskrit lexica.\n\nA.D.\nhalf-tamed and half-wild, having tusks somewhat broad of surface and white, and fixed in their bases as in golden cases,\\(^1\\) decked with gold, gems, and jewels.

After these there went in front, in due order, a column of foot-soldiers equipped with swords, three-tongued pikes, spears, javelins, one-tongued pikes, maces, clubs, and bows. After these King Andhagavanhi, his breast featly adorned with covering of pearls, his face aglitter with earrings, his head agleam from his crown, a lion of men, lord of men, Indra of men, bull of men, like a bull of human kings, blest with splendour of exceeding majesty and brilliant, riding upon the goodly shoulder of an elephant, with an umbrella garlanded with kore\u1e47\u1e6da blossoms held over him, with goodly white yak-tail fans fanning him; a lord of men like Vai\u015bravana, like the lord of the gods, widely renowned for splendour, followed in his course by a fourfold\\(^4\\) army filled with horses, elephants, chariots, and goodly warriors, set forth on his way toward the park Nanda\u1e47avane. Then in front of King Andhagavanhi\u2019s son Goyame came great horses and horse-riders, on both sides of him elephants and elephant-riders, and behind him a crowd of chariots; and then Goyame, with pitchers uplifted and fans held towards him, a white umbrella raised and horse-hair flappers waving over him, with full splendour . . . went forth into the midst of the city of B\u0101rava\u012b.\n\n\\(^1\\) See Hoernle\u2019s translation of Uv\u0101s., \u00a7 101, note.\n\n\\(^2\\) The Dalbergia ougeinensis.\n\n\\(^3\\) A variant is thirty-six.\n\n\\(^4\\) Viz., comprising cavalry, elephants, chariots, and infantry.\nNow when King Andhaga-v\u0101hi had gone forth... many that had desire of profit, [of pleasure, of enjoyment, of gain, buffoons, bowl-carriers,\\(^1\\) broken men,\\(^2\\) conch-carriers,\\(^3\\) discus-carriers,\\(^4\\) ploughshare-carriers,\\(^5\\) cozeners, acrobats,\\(^6\\) minstrels, and throngs of scholars,] hailed him without cease with these [hundreds of] agreeable, [lovely, dear, acceptable, winsome, soul-delighting, heart-gladdening, charming, auspicious prayers for victory and triumph,] and praised him, in these words: \"Victory,\\(^7\\) victory be to thee, O blessed one, by religion! victory, victory be to thee, O blessed one, by mortification! victory be to thee, O blessed one! happiness to thee by unbroken observances,\\(^8\\) by supreme knowledge, vision, and right conduct! conquer the unconquered organs of sense, preserve by conquest the Ascetic's religion! as conqueror of obstacles dwell, O King, amidst beatitude! smite by means of mortification the foemen passion and hate, thy mail stout-framed of patience, crush the enemy, the eight Works,\\(^9\\) by the supreme Bright\n\n\\(^1\\) K\u0101ro\u1e0diy\u0101, glossed as 'carriers of skulls' (\u015aaiva mendicants?) or 'of boxes of betel,' etc.\n\n\\(^2\\) Kara-v\u0101hiya, glossed as kara-p\u016bdit\u0101\u1e25, or n\u1e5bp\u0101bh\u0101vy\u0101-v\u0101hin\u0101\u1e25, or k\u0101re\u1e47a b\u0101dhit\u0101\u1e25.\n\n\\(^3\\) Carrying shells full of sandal; or m\u0101ngalya-k\u0101ri\u1e47\u0101\u1e25; or trumpet-blowers.\n\n\\(^4\\) Cakkiy\u0101, carrying a discus as weapon or as a religious emblem; or potters.\n\n\\(^5\\) Nangaliy\u0101, a kind of minstrel (bhatta) wearing a little plough-share on the neck (cf.

His father and mother now led forward Prince Goyame towards the Saint, thrice walked round him from right to right, praised and worshipped him, and said: \"This, Beloved of the Gods, is Prince Goyame, our only son\\(^2\\) . . . As the blue lotus, the day-lotus, or the night-lotus, born in the mire, grown amidst the water, is stained not with defilement of mire, so Prince Goyame, born in love, grown amidst enjoyment, is stained not with defilement of love or of enjoyment. Beloved of the Gods, he is stricken with terror of life's wanderings, fearful of birth, age, and death, and he is fain to shave his head before thee and go from household life into the Order of homeless friars. So we bestow on thee the gift of a disciple, Beloved of the Gods; prithee accept it.\"\n\nThus hidden by Prince Goyame's father and mother, the Saint duly gave assent to the matter.

The devotee has to ponder upon several or one of the objects discussed in the Scriptures under its several logical categories, while checking his breath and holding his body and eyes motionless.\n\n\\(^{2}\\) As above, p. 40.\nGoyame departed from before the Saint to the north-eastern side of him, and with his own hands doffed his ornaments, garlands, and finery. His mother received them in a swan-figured robe, and pouring forth tears like a rope of gems, or showers of rain, or sinduv\u0101ra flowers, or a broken pearl-string, weeping, wailing, and lamenting, she said: \"Thou must strive, child, thou must labour and put forth thy might; in this matter there must be no sloth; may this path likewise be ours!\" So Prince Goyame's father and mother, having praised and worshipped the Saint, went back by the way whereby they came forth.\n\nThen Prince Goyame with his own hands plucked out his hair in five handfuls, and went towards the Saint, thrice walked round him from right to right, praised and worshipped him, and said: \"The world is aflicker, sir, the world is aflame, sir, the world is aflicker and aflame, sir, with age and death. Even as a householder when his house is on fire takes thence some treasure of small mass and great worth that is therein, and goes aside with it, thinking that this which he has put away for himself will be in far or near life\\(^1\\) to his weal, pleasure, comfort, and bliss afterward; so this my one agreeable . . . treasure of righteousness which I have put away for myself will cut short my life-wanderings. Therefore I am fain to be taken into the Order by thyself, Beloved of the Gods, to be given the tonsure by thyself, to be trained by thyself, to be taught by thyself, to have thyself preach to me the law treating of right conduct, seeking of food, discipline, fruits of discipline, observance, practice, pilgrimage, and measure.\\(^2\\)\"\n\nThen the Saint himself took Prince Goyame into the\n\n---\n\n1 *Pacch\u0101-pur\u0101e loe*, explained as 'in a future or in the present life'; a variant, *pacch\u0101urassa*, 'regretful,' is also mentioned by the Comm.\n\n2 These terms are: (a) \u0101y\u0101ra, Sanskrit \u0101c\u0101ra, the religious life generally, especially study; (b) goyara, Sanskrit gocara, the begging of alms; (c) vinayaya, monastic discipline; (d) venaiya, Sanskrit vainayika, the results of vinaya\u2014e.g., the dissipation of karma in the soul; (e) cara\u1e47a and (f) karana, on which see pp. 8-9, note 6; (g) j\u0101y\u0101, Sanskrit y\u0101tra, pilgrimage; and (h) m\u0101y\u0101, Sanskrit m\u0101tr\u0101, limitation of food.\nOrder, himself gave him the tonsure, himself preached to him the law ... showing him how he should walk, how stand, how sit, how lie, how feed himself, how speak, how show forbearance whenever he uprose towards breathing things, born beings, live things, and animals,\u00b9 how be in this matter without sloth; and Prince Goyame, hearing from the Saint this godly instruction, duly undertook it, walking, standing ... according to his bidding.\u00b2\n\n* * *\n\nSo Goyame became a friar, heedful in walking, [\u00b3in speech, in seeking food, in taking up and laying down articles of equipment and vessels,\u2074 and in dropping ordure, urine, spittle, mucus, and dirt; guarded in mind, speech, and body, guarded, guarded in bodily organs, guarded in continence ...], and abode observing this Niggantha doctrine. And it befell that in the presence of the Saint Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha\u1e47em\u012b and Elders of such sort\u2075 Friar Goyame studied the Laws of Peace and others,\u2076 also the Eleven Scriptures,\n\n\u00b9 P\u0101\u1e47a (Sanskrit pr\u0101\u1e47a), bh\u016bya (Sanskrit bh\u016bta), j\u012bva, and satta (Sanskrit sattva), are explained by the Comm. as respectively creatures of from two to four organs, trees, creatures of five organs, and the living atoms of earth, water, fire, and wind.\n\n\u00b2 Here follows in the N\u0101y. a long episode (pp. 298-357), in which the flagging enthusiasm of the prince is stimulated anew by a tale of his former life.\n\n\u00b3 See Ovav\u0101i, \u00a7 27; Bhag., fol. 164.\n\n\u2074 The terms bhan\u1e0da and matta are not very clear. The Comm. on Ovav\u0101i, \u00a7 27, besides the above interpretation, proposes to take bhan\u1e0da-matta together as generally \u2018equipment,\u2019 or bhan\u1e0du as equipment or earthen vessels, and matta as a bowl. Bhan\u1e0da often signifies \u2018pottery.\u2019\n\n\u2075 Tah\u0101r\u016bva, i.e., of the right kind, proper. Compare Tath\u0101gata, and see Journ. R. Asiatic Society, 1898, p. 103 f.\n\n\u2076 The six \u0100va\u015byakas, or Laws of Necessary Ritual, of which the S\u0101m\u0101yika are first. The latter word is explained in the scriptural commentaries as from sam\u0101ya (see Hoernle\u2019s note, translation of Uv\u0101s., p. 31). Some older authorities, however, such as Um\u0101sv\u0101ti in the Tattv\u0101rtha-s\u016btra-bh\u0101\u1e63ya and Samantabhadra in his Ratnakaranda-\u015br\u0101vak\u0101c\u0101ra, more plausibly connect it with samaya, the \u2018hour,\u2019 or devotional office of Jains (cf. aud\u0101yiika, from udaya; Samantabhadra writes s\u0101mayika). To observe the S\u0101m\u0101yika properly, the worshipper\nand abode exercising himself by many fasts until the fourth, [sixth, eighth, tenth, or twelfth meal, or allowing but one meal in one month or half a month].\n\nIn those days, at that time, it befell that the Saint set out from the city of B\u0101rav\u0101\u012b, from the Nandanavana, to travel about in outer countries. And it befell that Friar Goyame made his way toward the Saint Aritthanemi, praised and worshipped him, thrice walked round him from right to right, and said: \u201cI am fain, with thy leave, sir, to abide observing a month\u2019s Monastic Standard; [if it please thee, Beloved of the Gods, make no stay.\u201d So Friar Goyame, being given leave by the Ascetic, and becoming glad . . . worshipped him, and abode observing a month\u2019s Monastic Standard. He duly with [thought, word, and] body underwent, maintained, accomplished, absolved, completed, announced, observed, and fulfilled to order, according to the scripture, to the rule, and to the way, according as was right and meet, a month\u2019s Monastic Standard; and after so doing he made his\n\nshould withdraw in the early morning, at mid-day, and at evening into a quiet spot, where with motionless body (squatting or standing in the k\u0101yotsarga pose) and folded hands he meditates fixedly upon his soul, the divinity of the Jina, etc., thrice bowing his head four times to each of the four quarters. For details of the modern ritual, see Jainatattvadar\u015ba, Hindi edition, p. 376. The other \u0100va\u015byakas are singing hymns to the twenty-four Jinas (stavana), worship (vandan\u0101), confession of sin (pratikramana), and k\u0101yotsarga. Observe the mention of the \u2018Scriptures\u2019 (Angas)\u2014an anachronism.\n\n1 As Jains usually take only two meals in the day, a fast until the fourth meal signifies denial of food for a day and a half, and would be reckoned as one upav\u0101sa, and similarly with longer fasts.\n\n2 Some details as to the austerities practised in the \u2018Monastic Standards\u2019 are given in the Comm. on Ovav\u0101\u012b, \u00a7 24.\n\n3 The rest of the story is taken from Bhag., fol. 165 f., the rubric in our text being: In the same wise as Khandae he underwent the twelve Monastic Standards, also the Gunarayana mortification, in the same way entirely; in the same wise as Khandae he pondered, took farewell, together with the Elders mounted Settumja, [came to his death] by a month\u2019s starvation. His period was twelve years, [and so forth] until \u201che was beatified.\u201d\nway toward the Saint, praised and worshipped him, and said: \"I am fain, sir, with thy leave, to abide observing the two months' Monastic Standard; if it please thee, Beloved of the Gods, make no stay.\" (Here, in the same manner, are described the Standards of two, three, four, five, six, and seven months each; then firstly, one of seven days and nights; secondly, one of seven days and nights; thirdly, one of seven days and nights; then one of a day and a night, then one of one night.) \"Then having . . . fulfilled the one night's Monastic Standard, Friar Goyame made his way toward the Saint . . . worshipped him, and said: \"I am fain, sir, with thy leave, to abide observing the mortification of the Gun\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-year; if it please thee, Beloved of the Gods, make no stay.\" So Friar Goyame, being given leave . . . abode observing the mortification of the Gun\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-year\u2014to wit, in the first month he constantly mortified himself by fasts until his fourth meal, while by day he sat in the utku\u1e6daka posture facing the sun and scorching himself on a scorching ground, and by night he sat naked in the v\u012br\u0101sana pose; in the second month he constantly mortified himself by fasts until his sixth meal, while by day he sat in the utku\u1e6daka posture facing the sun and scorching himself on a scorching ground, and by night he sat naked in the v\u012br\u0101sana pose; (and so forth, until) in the sixteenth month he constantly mortified himself by fasts until his thirty-fourth meal, while by day he sat in the utku\u1e6daka posture facing the sun and scorching himself on a scorching ground, and by night he sat naked in the v\u012br\u0101sana pose. So Friar Goyame . . . fulfilled the mortification of the Gun\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a year, and after doing so he made his way toward the Saint, praised and worshipped\n\n1 Probably the utkata\u015bana of the Yogic texts, in which usually the devotee kneels with toes gripping the ground and heels upward, with the anus resting on the heels and the hands grasping the knees.\n\n2 The devotee kneels on one leg, the other leg being in the posture of sitting; each foot is touching the thigh of the other leg; the hands hang downward. According to other authorities, he should squat with his legs folded under him and hands laid one upon another and resting upon his foot.\nhim, and abode exercising himself by many fasts . . . in divers mortifications.\n\nSo by this noble, abundant, zealous, earnest, happy, blissful, lucky, auspicious, splendid, lofty, magnificent, excelling, exalted, stately mortification Friar Goyame became withered, wizened, fleshless; he became a mere frame of bone and skin; he grew so that his bones rattled, emaciated, overspread with veins. It was by force of spirit alone that he walked and he halted. He was faint after speaking, and in speaking, and before speaking. As forsooth a cart full of sticks, or of leafage, or of oil-seed and jars and leafage, or of castor-oil sticks, or of coals, that has been put out in the heat and dried up, goes with a creaking and halts with a creaking, so Friar Goyame went with a creaking and halted with a creaking, being piled high with mortification and piled low with flesh and blood, and like a fire confined within a heap of ashes he shone mightily with glow, with lustre, and with splendour of glowing lustre.\n\nIn those days, at that time\u201d (the city was B\u0101ravai; the arrival of the Saint took place, and so forth, until) \u201cthe congregation went home. Now it befell that while Friar Goyame at the hour of midnight was holding a religious vigil, there arose in him the following inward, pensive, [eager, mental resolve]: \u201cTruly I by this . . . mortification am faint . . . I go with a creaking and halt with a creaking. But I have yet within me energy, work, power, vigour, manly force, prowess. So, forasmuch as I have yet within me energy . . . and forasmuch as I have abiding for teacher of the Law and instructor in the Law the Saint Arittha\u00f1emi, the Conqueror, the seeker of weal\\(^1\\); now, therefore, on the morrow, when the night shall have lightened into dawn and the sun shall arise in golden lustre, whereunto tenderly open the eyes of the full day-lotuses and water-lilies,\\(^2\\) like in hue to the red \u0101soka or to the ruddy\n\n\\(^1\\) Suhatthi, interpreted both as subh\u0101rth\u012b, \u2018seeking weal,\u2019 and as su-hasti, \u2018noble elephant.\u2019\n\n\\(^2\\) Utpala, the blue lotus (Nymph\u00e6a caerulea), and kamala, the Nelumbium. The Comm., however, understands kamala as \u2018deer\u2019 (cf. k\u1e5b\u1e0d\u0101s). The kim\u015buka is the Butea frondosa; the gunja is Abrus precatorius.\ntint of kim\u015bukas, parrots' beaks, or cleft gunja berries, the awakener of the bushy lotus-pools, the thousand-rayed maker of day, gleaming with brilliance, it will be best for me to praise, worship . . . and wait before the Saint; and then, having gotten leave of him, to take upon myself the five Great Vows,\\(^1\\) to ask forgiveness of the friars and nuns, and with godly Elders of such sort to climb slowly up Mount Pundar\u012be,\\(^2\\) which is like to a mass of clouds, a meeting-place of the gods; and there I will look to get me a clean da\u00efs of earthen blocks, spread a bed of darbha grass, and sitting thereupon in the p\u0101ovagaya condition,\\(^3\\) renouncing food and drink, I will wait without eagerness for death by wasting away in starvation.\u201d Thus he pondered, and on the morrow . . . he made his way toward the Saint . . . and waited before him.\n\n\u201cO Goyame!\u201d said the Saint to him, \u201cverily, when thou, Goyame, at the hour of midnight wast holding a religious vigil, there arose in thee the following inward . . . resolve: \u2018Truly I . . . will wait without eagerness for death by wasting away in starvation\u2019; and thou art come speedily to me. Verily, Goyame, the matter is indeed right. Therefore, Beloved of the Gods, if it please thee, make no stay.\u201d\n\nThen Friar Goyame, being given leave by the Saint, became glad and joyful . . . rose up, thrice walked round the Saint from right to right . . . worshipped him, took upon himself the five Great Vows, asked forgiveness of the friars and nuns, and together with godly Elders of such sort climbed slowly up Mount Pundar\u012be . . . There he looked to get him a clean da\u00efs of earthen blocks and a clean spot\n\n\\(^1\\) Namely, the vows to do no hurt, to speak only what is kindly, wholesome, and true, to steal not, to observe continence, and to have no possessions\u2014ahims\u0101-s\u016bnyat\u0101steya-brahmacary\u0101parigr\u0101h\u0101\u1e25.\n\n\\(^2\\) An ancient name for Mount \u015aatrunjaya (Settumja) in Gujarat. In the Bhagavat\u012b Khandae is beatified on Mount Viule (Sanskrit Vipula), near R\u0101jagr\u012bha and Buddha-gay\u0101, as are some of the protagonists in the Antaga\u1e0da-das\u0101o.\n\n\\(^3\\) A posture in which the devotee sits motionless awaiting death. See \u0100y\u0101r., I. vii. 8. 19; Bhag., fols. 160, 171; N\u0101y., p. 376, etc.\nfor easing nature, spread a bed of darbha-grass, sat there-\nupon with his face to the east in a squatting posture,\\(^1\\) raised to his head the ten fingers of his hands clasped before his forehead with joined palms, and said: \"Homage be to the Saints, the Lords\\(^2\\) . . . homage to the Saint Arittha\u00f1emi\\(^3\\)! . . . I where I am give praise to my lord where he is; may my lord where he is behold me where I am!\\(^4\\)\" Thus having praised and worshipped, he said: \"Already in the presence of the Saint Arittha\u00f1emi I have renounced for all my life all harm to living things, [false speech, taking of goods not given, lying with woman, possession of goods, wrath pride deceit and lust, passion, wrath, strife, slander, tale-bearing, evil speech, displeasure pleasure guile and wile, and] sting of false vision\\(^6\\); and now, in presence of the Saint, once more I renounce for all my life all harm to living things . . .

Thereupon [two] that went round by the second open place . . . [entered the house of Deva\u012b . . . she filled a platter with siha-kesara cakes, bestowed it on the friars . . . and] dismissed them. Thereupon [two] that went round by the third open place . . . [entered the house of Deva\u012b . . . she filled a platter with siha-kesara cakes,] bestowed it on them, and said: \"Can it be, Beloved of the Gods, that in this city of B\u0101rava\u012b of Kanhe V\u0101sudeve, which is nine yojanas . . . a very heaven manifest, Niggantha monks going round . . . to the higher, the lower, [and the middle orders . . .] receive not food and drink? For they visit these same orders again and again for food and drink.\" Then the friars said to Queen Deva\u012b: \"Verily, Beloved of the Gods, it is not true that in this city of B\u0101rava\u012b . . . Niggantha monks going round . . . to the higher, the lower, [and the middle orders . . .] receive not food and drink; they do not visit these same orders twice and thrice for food and drink. Truly, Beloved of the Gods, we are six brothers, sons of the gentleman N\u0101ge in the city of Bhaddilapure, born of his wife Sulasa, peer . . . We have heard the Law from the Saint Aritthanemi, we have become stricken with terror of life's wanderings, fearful of birth and death, and have shaven our heads and gone into the Order. And on the day that we went into the Order we praised and worshipped the Saint Aritthanemi, and took the following vow: \"We are fain, sir, by thy leave . . .\" Thus we, being given leave by the Saint, are abiding for all our lives [constantly mortifying ourselves] by fasts until our sixth meal. So to-day, when the time came round for allowing ourselves our sixth meal . . . we went round and entered thy house. But truly, Beloved of the Gods, we are not the same as they.\" Thus they spoke to Queen Deva\u012b, and went back by the way that they had come.\n\nThen in Queen Deva\u012b arose the following . . . resolve:\n\"Truly it was prophesied of me at the city of Pol\u0101sapure by Aimutte the boy-friar in my childhood that I should bear eight sons, peer . . . and no other mothers in Bh\u0101rahe-v\u0101se should bear such sons. But this proves herewith manifestly false. Other mothers in Bh\u0101rahe-v\u0101se do indeed bear sons, peer . . . So I will go now to the Saint Arit\u1e6dhanem\u012b and ask him of this prophecy.\" Thus she pondered, and summoned the chamberlains, and said: \"[\u201c1Hasten, Beloved of the Gods, to have a goodly car of state yoked by skilful men with goodly young oxen which are like to one another in hoofs, tails, and horns of like marking, which are set off with gold-tasselled neck-cords, which are held in by a bridle of nose-cords bearing silver bells, made of cotton cord, and decked with fine gold, and which wear chaplets of blue lotus-flowers; let it be hung round with a network of divers gems and golden bells, fitted with a well-made, becoming, straight, seemly, deftly cut pole, supplied with excellent equipment, altogether fitting; and then bring back the report of my command.\u201d\n\nThen Queen Deva\u012b bathed herself . . . decked her body with ornaments of great and small price, and with a ring of handmaidens surrounding her she mounted the goodly car of state, went forth into the midst of the city of B\u0101rava\u012b, and made her way toward the Sahassambava\u1e47e park. Then she alighted from the car of state, and with the ring of handmaidens encircling her she made her way toward the Saint Arit\u1e6dhanem\u012b, thrice [walked round him from right to right,] praised and worshipped him, then [courteously] waited with clasped hands before the Saint, neither very near nor very far, wishful to hear and worshipping, standing there.]\n\nThen the Saint Arit\u1e6dhanem\u012b said to Queen Deva\u012b: \u201cVerily, Deva\u012b, when thou sawest these six friars there arose in thee the following . . . purpose: \u201cTruly it was prophesied of me in the city of Pol\u0101sapure by Aimutte . . .\u201d So thou art come hither into my presence. Verily, Deva\u012b, the\n\n1 The rest of this and the next paragraph are as given in Bhag., fol. 789, and Uv\u0101s., \u00a7 206.\nmatter is indeed right. Truly, Dev\u0101\u012b, there dwelt in those days . . . a gentleman named N\u0101ge in the city of Bhaddilapure, rich . . . This gentleman N\u0101ge had a wife named Sulasa. Of the lady Sulasa it was prophesied in her childhood by a soothsayer that she should bear dead babes. Now Sulasa was from childhood a worshipper of the god Harinegamesi.\u00b9 She caused to be made an image of Harinegamesi, and every morning she bathed . . . performed the lustratory rites, and with a moist robe\u00b2 made flower-offerings of great worth, fell upon her knees, did reverence, and thereafter took food and did her offices. By the lady Sulasa\u2019s devotion, veneration, and obedience the god Harinegamesi was won over. So in compassion for the lady Sulasa the god Harinegamesi made both her and thee to become pregnant at the same time. Both of you together conceived, both were together big with child, both together bore babes. But the lady Sulasa bore stillborn babes. Then the god Harinegamesi in compassion for the lady Sulasa took away her stillborn babes in the hollow of his hand, and carried them to thee. At that time thou too didst bear after nine months tender babes. Thy children, Beloved of the Gods, he took away from thee in the hollow of his hand, and carried them to the lady Sulasa. So these are in truth sons of thee, Dev\u0101\u012b, not of the lady Sulasa.\u00b3\n\nThen Queen Dev\u0101\u012b, having heard and listened to this matter from the Saint Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dhanem\u012b, became glad and\n\n\u00b9 The captain of the celestial infantry, and represented with an antelope\u2019s head.\n\n\u00b2 Ullaga-pa\u1e0da-s\u0101daena\u1e41, glossed as above; it is the udaka-s\u0101\u1e6dik\u0101 of the Buddhists.\n\n\u00b3 This refers to a legend. At the marriage of Vasudeva and Devak\u012b (Dev\u0101\u012b), J\u012bvaya\u015b\u0101, the wife of Kamsa, became drunk and took liberties with the saint Atimukta (Aimutte), who in his wrath told her that Devak\u012b\u2019s seventh child would slay her husband Kamsa and her father. Terrified by this threat, Kamsa made Vasudeva promise to give him his first seven children as soon as they were born. The first six children were carried by a god to Sulasa, whose stillborn babes he brought to Devak\u012b, whence they were taken to Kamsa. The seventh was K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a V\u0101sudeva (Kanhe), whose history in Jain legend is very similar to the Brahmanic story.\njoyful... She praised and worshipped the Saint Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha\u1e47emi, and then made her way toward the six friars. All six friars she praised and worshipped, her milk rising, her eyes streaming, her bodice spreading out, her bracelets splitting on her arms, the root-cells of her hair swelling like kadamba-flowers beaten by rain-showers. She looked upon the six friars with a fixed eye, gazed very long, praised and worshipped them, and then made her way toward the Saint Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha\u1e47emi, thrice walked round him from right to right, praised and worshipped him, mounted her car of state, and set out toward the city of B\u0101rava\u012b. She entered the city of B\u0101rava\u012b, and made her way toward her own house, toward the outer audience-chamber; then she alighted from her goodly car of state, and made her way toward her own bower, toward her couch, and sat down upon her couch. Then in Queen Deva\u012b there arose this... [thought]: \"Verily I have born six sons, peer... like Nalak\u016bvara; but I have not known joy of the childhood of even one of them. There is but Kanhe V\u0101sudeve, who comes hither to me every six months to do reverence at my feet. Happy then, righteous, working righteousness, fulfilled in their purposes, fulfilled of their tokens, are those mothers, I trow, that have such who are born from their own wombs, greedy for the milk of their breasts, sweetly babbling, lispingly prattling, encompassing from their waists their loins, childlike, and again and again with hands like tender lotus-flowers grasp them, and lying in their bosoms utter again and again most sweet and prettily prattling converse. But I am unhappy, unrighteous, working unrighteousness, for I have not gotten even one.\" Thus was she downcast [in the cogitations of her spirit], and brooded.\n\nNow Kanhe V\u0101sudeve bathed... decked his body with ornaments of small and great price, and came thither to do reverence at the feet of Queen Deva\u012b. He saw her to be downcast... and brooding, and laying hold of her\n\n1 N\u0101y., p. 133, etc.\nfeet, he said: \"Erstwhile, mother, thou wert glad . . . to see me; why to-day, mother, art thou downcast . . . and brooding?\" Then Queen Dev\u0101\u012b said to him: \"Verily, my son, I have born seven sons, peer . . . but I have not known joy of the childhood of even one. Thou only, my son, dost come hither to me every six months to do reverence at my feet. Happy then . . .\" (repeat as above, until) \"I brood.\"\n\nThen Ka\u1e47he V\u0101sudeve said to her: \"Nay, mother, be not downcast . . . nor brood. I will strive so that a younger brother may be born to me.\" With these agreeable . . . words he comforted her, departed thence, and took his way toward the oratory.\u00b9 [He swept the oratory, looked to get him a clean spot for easing nature and a clean bed of darbha-grass, sat down upon the bed of darbha-grass, set himself to keep a fast until the eighth meal, observing the continence of the posaha in the oratory, [having taken off his jewels and gold, laid aside his garlands and unguents of sandal, and put away his sword and mace, alone with none beside,] and sat with his mind fixed upon the god Harinegamesi. When Ka\u1e47he V\u0101sudeve's fast was coming to an end, the god Harinegamesi's seat shook. Harinegamesi, seeing his seat shake, put forth his cosmic\u00b2 vision. Then in him arose the following . . . [thought]: \"Verily in the continent of Jambuddive, in Bh\u0101rahe-v\u0101se, in the southern half of Bh\u0101rahe-v\u0101se, in the city of\n\n\u00b9 Posaha-s\u0101l\u0101, the chamber where Jains hold the posaha. This is the Sanskrit upavasatha, though often falsely Sanskritized as pro\u1e63adha or pausadha. It is a fast held on the eighth and fourteenth of each fortnight, and on the days of new and full moon, sometimes also on special occasions. The worshipper withdraws from the world, hears or reads the Scriptures, or sits in devout meditation, while withholding from himself the four kinds of food (viz., that which is eaten, drunk, chewed, or licked, corresponding to the terms in our text, 'food, drink, sweetmeats, and dainties'), ornaments, scent, snuff, flowers, baths, and unguents.

Truly it is best for me to reveal myself to him.\u201d Thus he pondered. Then he came down to the north-eastern quarter, transformed himself by a magical mutation,\u00b9 and spread himself out over numerous yojanas like a rod; of ratnas,\u00b2 diamonds, beryls, lohit\u0101k\u1e63a rubies, cat\u2019s-eyes, ha\u1e43sa-garbha crystal, garnets, saugandhika rubies, jasper, ankas, anjanas, silver, gold, anjana-pulakas, crystal, and ri\u1e63\u1e6das, he cast away the gross atoms, and took to himself the fine atoms.\u00b3 Then with the sublime, hasty, speedy, impetuous, swift, proud, rapid, triumphant, divine course of the gods he made his way toward the continent of Jambudd\u012bve, toward Bh\u0101rahe-v\u0101se, toward the southern half of Bh\u0101rahe-v\u0101se, toward the city of B\u0101ravai, toward the oratory, toward Kanhe V\u0101sudeve, and appeared in the sky, clad in fine robes of the five colours bearing bells. And he said to Kanhe V\u0101sudeve: \u201cI am Harin\u0113gamesi, O Beloved of the Gods. Forasmuch as thou art sitting in thy oratory keeping a fast with thy mind fixed upon me, I have come speedily to thee, Beloved of the Gods. Show me now, Beloved of the Gods, what I may do, what I may give, what I may seek, or what is the desire of thy heart.\u201d Then Kanhe V\u0101sudeve saw Harin\u0113gamesi apparent in the sky, and became glad and joyful; he went on with the\n\n\u00b9 Veuvviya-samuggh\u0101\u1e47am samoh\u0101\u1e47ai, \u2018changes himself by a vaikriya-samudgh\u0101ta.\u2019 Souls (j\u012bva) are associated with five bodies: aud\u0101rika, or gross; k\u0101rma\u1e47a, or body of atoms of karma; taijasa, or fiery body with the function of digestion; \u0101h\u0101raka, or vehicle for transporting souls over space; and vaikriya, or subtle mutative form (see especially Tattv\u0101rtha-s\u016btra-bh\u0101sya, ii. 37 et seq.). In a samudgh\u0101ta of this kind the soul by a violent effort works off the peculiar atomic karma which forms its vaikriya body, throwing it out together with its own j\u012bva-prade\u015bas or atomic points in space. See especially Bhag., ii. 2, iii. 1, 4, and Comm., etc.\n\n\u00b2 Some class of jewels, here glossed as usual \u2018karketana (chrysoberyl), etc.\u2019\n\n\u00b3 After this the N\u0101y. gives two alternative descriptions of the god\u2019s flight; I have rendered the second.\nposaha rites, then] clasping his hands, said: \"I desire, Beloved of the Gods, that a younger brother, born of the same mother, be given me.\" Then Harin\u0113gamaes\u012b said to him: \"Beloved of the Gods, thou shalt have a younger brother, born of the same mother, who shall fall from the gods' world. When he has passed his childhood... he shall shave his head before the Saint Arittha\u1e47em\u012b and go into the Order...\" Twice and thrice he spoke thus to Ka\u1e47he V\u0101sudeve, and then went back by the way that he had come.\n\nThen Ka\u1e47he V\u0101sudeve went forth from the oratory, and took his way toward Queen Devai. He laid hold of her feet and said: \"Thou shalt have a younger brother to me, mother.\" With these agreeable... words he comforted her, and went back by the way that he had come.\n\nThen it befell that Queen Devai lay in a chamber of this sort... she saw a lion in her dream, and awoke... she joyfully carried the unborn babe; and after nine months... she bare a boy... like of hue to the suma\u1e47a blossom, the red bandhujivaka, distilled lac-dye, the lush coral-tree, and the early sun, dear to the eyes of all, delicate... goodly of form, like an elephant's palate.\" (The birth is to be narrated in the same way as that of Prince Mehe,) until) \"For that this our child is like an elephant's palate, therefore be the name of this our child Gaya-sukum\u0101le.\" So the child's father and mother gave him the name of Gaya-sukum\u0101le.\" (The rest is to be told in the same way as of Mehe, until) \"ripe for enjoyment.\"\n\n\"Now there dwelt in the city of B\u0101ravai a Brahman named Somile. He was rich, and [taught, kept in guard, retained, and went through] the Rig-veda, [the Yajur-\n\n---\n\n1 See above, p. 16.\n2 Pentapetes phoenicea.\n3 N\u0101y., p. 169 et seq.; cf. the story of Goyame above.\n4 This description is from Bhag., fol. 149.

Now it befell once that the maiden Som\u0101 bathed . . . decked her body with ornaments of small and great price, and attended by many hunchback women . . . set forth from her own house and took her way toward the high-road. There she stood playing with a golden bat and ball. In those days . . . the Saint Aritthanemi arrived. The congregation went forth. Then Ka\u1e47he V\u0101sudeve, having heard the matter of this tale, bathed . . . decked his body with ornaments of small and great price, and went out together with Prince Gaya-sukum\u0101le upon the goodly shoulder of an elephant, with an umbrella garlanded with kore\u1e47\u1e6da blossoms held over him, with goodly white yak-tails fanning him, into the midst of the city of B\u0101rava\u012b, to do reverence at the feet of the Saint Aritthanemi. He beheld the maiden Som\u0101, and marvelled at her shapeliness, bloom, and loveliness. He summoned his chamberlains, and said: \u201cGo now, Beloved of the Gods, entreat the Brahman Somile, and take the maiden Som\u0101 and bestow her in the damsels\u2019 chamber of the harem. Then she shall become the wife of Prince Gaya-sukum\u0101le.\u201d The chamberlains . . . bestowed her there.\n\nThen Ka\u1e47he V\u0101sudeve went forth into the midst of the city of B\u0101rava\u012b, [made his way] toward the Sahassambavana park . . . waited before [the Saint]. Thereupon\n\n\\(^1\\) Sikkh\u0101-kappa, glossed as the theory of the letters and their application.\nthe Saint Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha\u1e47em\u012b before Kanhe V\u0101sudeve and Prince Gaya-sukum\u0101le and that [mighty congregation preached various] doctrine. Kanhe went back. Then Gaya-sukum\u0101le, having heard the Law from the Saint Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha\u1e47em\u012b . . .\" (Here the story is to be told in the same wise as of Mehe,\\(^1\\) repeating \"Beloved of the Gods, I will say farewell to my father and mother,\" but omitting mention of the princesses, as far as \"the task of carrying onward the succession of the line of our stock.\") \"Then Kanhe V\u0101sudeve, having heard the matter of this tale, came to Gaya-sukum\u0101le, embraced him, clasped him to his bosom, and said: \"Thou art my younger brother, born of the same mother; now prithee, Beloved of the Gods, shave not thy head . . . nor go forth into the Order. I will anoint thee with a great royal anointment-ceremony in the city of B\u0101rava\u012b.\"\n\nBut Gaya-sukum\u0101le, thus bidden by Kanhe V\u0101sudeve, stood silent. Then he spoke thus twice and thrice to Kanhe V\u0101sudeve and his father and mother: \"In sooth, Beloved of the Gods, the delights of mortal love are . . . to be abandoned. Therefore I am fain by your leave, Beloved of the Gods . . . to go forth into the Order.\"\n\nThen Kanhe V\u0101sudeve and his father and mother, having prevailed not upon Gaya-sukum\u0101le by many [declarations . . .] in accord [with sense-enjoyment], now said unwillingly to him: \"Child, we are fain then to see thee in royal state for but one day.\" \"(Here is to be told the withdrawal from the world in the same way as of Mahabale,\\(^1\\) until \"according to his bidding.\")\n\n\"So Gaya-sukum\u0101le became a friar, heedful in walking . . . guarded in continence. Now in the afternoon of the day when Prince Gaya-sukum\u0101le went into the Order he took his way toward the Saint Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha\u1e47em\u012b, thrice walked round him from right to right, praised and worshipped him, and said: \"I am fain, sir, by thy leave to abide observing the Great Standard of one night in the grave-\n\n\\(^1\\) And of Goyame, above.\nyard of Mah\u0101k\u0101le. If it please thee, Beloved of the Gods, [make no stay].\u201d Then Friar Gaya-sukum\u0101le, being given leave by the Saint Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dhanemi, praised and worshipped him, sallied forth from the Sahassambavane park from the presence of the Saint, and took his way toward the graveyard of Mah\u0101k\u0101le. He looked to get him a clean spot of ground and a clean place for easing nature, and abode observing the Great Standard of one night, his body bent a little forward, [his limbs duly set in order, all his organs guarded, his arms stretched out, his eyes unwinking, his gaze fixed upon a single object,] his two feet placed together.\n\nNow the Brahman Somile went out eastward\u00b2 from the city of B\u0101ravai for fuel, and gathered faggots, darbha-grass, ku\u015ba-spikes, and leafy twigs; then he returned thence, and as he was passing neither very near nor very far from the graveyard of Mah\u0101k\u0101le, at the hour of evening twilight when very few men were about, he espied Friar Gaya-sukum\u0101le. Then he recalled his spite, and fell into a rage, and said: \u201cHo, this is Prince Gaya-sukum\u0101le, desirous of the undesirable, [marked out for an ill end, marrer of the holy fourteenth-day,\u00b3 devoid of modesty, fortune, comfort, and honour,) who has abandoned the maiden Som\u0101 my daughter, born to me of my wife Somasiri, although no fault was seen in her nor shortcoming, and she was in her season, and has shaved his head . . . and gone into the Order. Forsooth it were best then for me to wreak my spite on Prince Gaya-sukum\u0101le.\u201d Thus he pondered, and having looked about him he took some moist clay, drew near to Friar Gaya-sukum\u0101le, stuck it as an earthen bowl on Friar Gaya-sukum\u0101le\u2019s head, took in a pot from a pyre flaming coals of khadira-wood\u2074 like blooming kim\u015buka-flowers, and shot them upon Friar Gaya-sukum\u0101le\u2019s head. Then in fear, [\u2075dread, terror, horror, and alarm] he departed speedily, and went back\n\n\u00b9 See Bhag., fol. 248. \u00b2 Cf. Bhag., fol. 908.\n\u00b3 See Hoernle\u2019s translation of Uv\u0101s., p. 70. \u2074 The Acacia catechu.\n\u2075 See Uv\u0101s., \u00a7 256, etc.\nby the way that he had come. Then in the body of Friar Gaya-sukum\u0101le there arose fiery, [abounding, violent, furious, vehement, grievous, bitter, and] intolerable pain; but he bore this fiery . . . pain without even a thought of wrath against the Brahman Somile. And as he bore this boundless fiery . . . pain in a blessed spirit, with fine resolution, by reason of the dissipation of his hindering Works he entered into the apuvva-kara\u1e47a stage which scatters the murk of Works, and in him arose boundless, supreme, [unchecked, unhindered, wide, perfect,] absolute knowledge and vision; and thereupon he became beatified, [enlightened, released, brought to perfect peace,] free of all sorrow. Then he was duly hailed by the gods that were near, and accordingly a divine rain of fragrant scented waters poured down, flowers of the five colours fell, cloaks were waved, and a divine sound of melody and minstrelsy was heard.\n\nOn the morrow . . . Kanhe V\u0101sudeve bathed . . . decked his body with ornaments of small and great price, and riding on the goodly shoulder of an elephant, with an umbrella garlanded with kore\u1e47\u1e6da blossoms held over him, with goodly white yak-tails fanning him, and with a numerous throng of mighty soldiers encompassing him, set forth into the midst of the city of B\u0101rava\u012b, toward the Saint Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha\u1e47em\u012b. Now as he was going forth into the midst of the city, he beheld a man worn out, wasted of body by reason of age, faint, hungry, thirsty, feeble, and weary, who was taking bricks one after the other from a very great pile thereof and conveying them from the public road to within his house. Then Kanhe V\u0101sudeve in pity for the man, albeit he was riding on the goodly shoulder of an elephant, took a brick and conveyed it from the\n\n1 See Comm. on Uv\u0101s., \u00a7 111, and on this passage.\n2 Pari\u1e47\u0101menam, literally 'development,' mood of soul.\n3 The eighth gu\u1e47a-sth\u0101naka, or stage in the soul's progress towards release; the soul here breaks the bonds of error, passion, and hate, which check its knowledge and vision. On attainment of 'absolute knowledge' (kevala j\u00f1\u0101na) see especially Tattv\u0101rtha-s\u016btra-bh\u0101ya' x. 1 et seq.\npublic road to within his house. And when one brick had been taken by Ka\u1e47he V\u0101sudeve, many hundreds of men conveyed the very great pile of bricks from the public road to within the house. Then Ka\u1e47he V\u0101sudeve went forth into the midst of the city of B\u0101rav\u0101l, and took his way toward the Saint Arit\u1e6dha\u1e47em\u012b . . . praised and worshipped him. Beholding not Friar Gaya-sukum\u0101le, he praised and worshipped the Saint Arit\u1e6dha\u1e47em\u012b, and said: \u201cWhere, sir, is my younger brother, born of my mother, Friar Gaya-sukum\u0101le, that I may praise and worship him?\u201d Then the Saint Arit\u1e6dha\u1e47em\u012b said to him: \u201cFriar Gaya-sukum\u0101le, O Ka\u1e47he, has won to his goal.\u201d And Ka\u1e47he V\u0101sudeve said to the Saint: \u201cHow, sir, has Friar Gaya-sukum\u0101le won to his goal?\u201d So the Saint Arit\u1e6dha\u1e47em\u012b said to him: \u201cVerily, Ka\u1e47he, Friar Gaya-sukum\u0101le yesterday in the afternoon praised and worshipped me . . .\u201d (repeat as above, until) \u201cand abode [observing the Great Standard of one night . . .]. Then a certain man espied Friar Gaya-sukum\u0101le, and fell into a rage . . .\u201d (repeat as above, until) \u201che became beatified. Verily, Ka\u1e47he, Friar Gaya-sukum\u0101le has won to his goal.\u201d\n\nThen Ka\u1e47he V\u0101sudeve said to the Saint: \u201cWho, sir, was the man desirous of the undesirable . . . who has thus unseasonably taken the life of . . . Gaya-sukum\u0101le?\u201d And the Saint Arit\u1e6dha\u1e47em\u012b said to him: \u201cNay, Ka\u1e47he, conceive thou no wrath against that man. Verily, Ka\u1e47he, the man did but give a helping hand to Friar Gaya-sukum\u0101le.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how, sir, did the man give a helping hand to Friar Gaya-sukum\u0101le?\u201d\n\nThen the Saint Arit\u1e6dha\u1e47em\u012b said to him: \u201cTruly, Ka\u1e47he, when thou wert coming hither to do reverence at my feet thou sawest in the city of B\u0101rav\u0101l a man . . . Even as thou, Ka\u1e47he, gavest a helping hand to that man, so, Ka\u1e47he, did this man give a helping hand to Friar Gaya-sukum\u0101le, letting loose the Works gathered by him in many hundreds and thousands of existences, in order that the abundance of his Works might be dispelled.\u201d\nThen Kanhe V\u0101sudeve said to the Saint Aritthanemi: \"How, sir, may I know this man?\" And the Saint Aritthanemi said to him: \"Thou mayst know him, Kanhe, to be he who, on beholding thee entering the city of B\u0101rava\u012b, shall break down as he stands and give up the ghost; he is the man.\"\n\nThen Kanhe V\u0101sudeve praised and worshipped the Saint Aritthanemi, and took his way toward his precious elephant of state, mounted upon it, and set out to go toward the city of B\u0101rava\u012b, toward his own house.\n\nNow on the morrow . . . there arose in the Brahman Somile the following inward . . . [thought]: \"Verily Kanhe V\u0101sudeve has gone forth to do reverence at the feet of the Saint Aritthanemi; it will be known by the Saint, heard by the Saint, understood by the Saint, reached by the Saint; and to Kanhe V\u0101sudeve it is not known: Kanhe V\u0101sudeve will bring me to some evil end.\" Being therefore in fear . . . he sallied forth from his house, and looking neither to the quarters nor to the cross-quarters\u00b9 he came in front of Kanhe V\u0101sudeve, who was entering into the city of B\u0101rava\u012b. Then of a sudden he beheld Kanhe V\u0101sudeve, and in fear . . . he broke down as he stood and gave up the ghost, and fell with a crash in a heap on the ground. And Kanhe V\u0101sudeve saw him, and said: \"Ho, Beloved of the Gods, this is the Brahman Somile, desirous of the undesirable . . . who has thus unseasonably taken the life of . . . Gaya-sukum\u0101le.\" So he caused the Brahman Somile to be dragged away by hooks and the ground to be sprinkled with water, took his way toward his own home, and entered therein.\n\nVerily this, O Jamb\u016b, is the matter of the eighth lesson in the third chapter of [the eighth Scripture,] the Fortunes of End-winners, preached by the Ascetic.\"\n\n(For the ninth lesson the usual introduction is to be prefixed.) \"Truly, Jamb\u016b, in those days . . .\" (It was\n\n\u00b9 Sa-pakkhim sa-padidisim, literally 'the quarters (N., S., E., W.) and the cross quarters (N.E., N.W., etc.) being equal'\u2014i.e., running headlong.

The ascetic D\u012bv\u0101ya\u1e47e (Sanskrit Dvaip\u0101yana) was outraged by some drunken princes (Sambe and others), and performed severe penances, ending with his death, in order thereby to obtain the power to avenge himself in a future birth.

D\u012bv\u0101ya\u1e47e was reborn as an Agni-kum\u0101ra god, and burned down B\u0101rava\u012b; nearly every inhabitant perished.\n\n2 N\u0101y., p. 1075; Comm. on Uv\u0101s., \u00a7 240, etc.\n\"Wherefore, sir, is it thus said that never . . . they go into the Order?\"\n\n\"O Kanhe,\" said the Saint to him, \"verily all V\u0101sudeves in their former life, Kanhe, have framed a sinful purpose\\(^1\\); for this reason, Kanhe, it is thus said that never . . . they go into the Order.\"\n\nThen Kanhe said to the Saint: \"And I, sir, when I come to my death in my death-month\u2014whither shall I go from here, where shall I be reborn?\"\n\nAnd the Saint said to him: \"Verily, Kanhe, thou shalt be sent forth by thy mother and father's behest from the city of B\u0101ravai when it shall be consumed by reason of strong waters, fire, and the wrath of Div\u0101yane; together with R\u0101me and Baladeve thou shalt set forth toward the southern ocean unto Pa\u1e47\u1e0du-mahur\u0101,\\(^2\\) unto the five Pa\u1e47\u1e0daves, sons of King Pa\u1e47\u1e0du, whose chief is Juhi\u1e6d\u1e6dhile\\(^3\\); and in the Kosamba forest, underneath a goodly nyagrodha-tree,\\(^4\\) upon a da\u00efs of earthen blocks, thy body covered with a yellow robe, thou shalt be wounded in the left foot by a sharp arrow shot by Jar\u0101kum\u0101re from his bow. So shalt thou come to death in thy death-month, and be reborn as a hell-dweller in a flaming hell in the third earth, V\u0101luyap-pabh\u0101.\\(^5\\)\"\n\nAs he heard and listened to this matter from the Saint Arit\u1e6dhanem\u012b, Kanhe V\u0101sudeve grew downcast . . . and brooded.\n\n\"O Kanhe,\" said the Saint to him, \"be not downcast . . . nor brood, Beloved of the Gods. Verily thou shalt issue thereafter from the flaming hell in the third earth, Beloved of the Gods, and here in the continent of Jam-buddive, in Bh\u0101rahe-v\u0101se, in the coming Ussappin\u012b age, among the Pun\u1e0da\\(^6\\) folk, in the city of Sayaduv\u0101re, thou\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Nid\u0101na; see above, p. 80, note.\n\n\\(^2\\) See Cosmographic Appendix.\n\n\\(^3\\) The Sanskrit Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira.\n\n\\(^4\\) Ficus indica.\n\n\\(^5\\) The hells (narak\u0101) are located in seven earths, which lie one under the other below our earth.

He clapped his hands on his thighs, leaped about, broke into a three-step dance, uttered a lion's roar, praised and worshipped the Saint Aritthanem\u012b, then mounted his same elephant of state, and took his way toward the city of B\u0101rava\u012b, toward his own house. He alighted from his precious elephant of state, and took his way toward the outer audience-chamber, toward his own throne, sat down upon the goodly throne with his face toward the east, summoned the chamberlains, and said: \"Go, Beloved of the Gods, make proclamation in the open places... and thus say: 'Verily, Beloved of the Gods, destruction will come upon the city of B\u0101rava\u012b, which is nine yojanas... by reason of strong waters, fire, and D\u012bv\u0101ya\u1e47e; therefore, Beloved of the Gods, if any king, heir-apparent, prince, baron, prefect, mayor, banker, merchant, queen, young man, or maid in the city of B\u0101rava\u012b is fain to shave the head in the presence of the Saint Aritthanem\u012b and go into the Order, Kanhe V\u0101sudeve grants leave to go; and to him that shall afterward be faint he allows to live in the same course as aforetime; and he is making his withdrawal from the world with great splendour, entertainment, and assemblage.' Twice and thrice make this proclamation, and bring me back the report of this my command.\" And the chamberlains... brought back the report.\n\nNow Paum\u0101va\u012b had heard and listened to the doctrine from the Saint, and becoming glad and joyful... she\n\n1 A T\u012brthakara, or Arhat, as possessing kevala, or absolute knowledge.\n2 So the Guj.

She alighted from her car of state, took her way toward Kanhe Vasudeve, [raised her hands with joined] palms, and said to him: \"I am fain, Beloved of the Gods, by thy leave, to shave my head in the presence of the Saint Aritthanemi and go into the Order; if it please thee . . .\" Then Kanhe Vasudeve summoned the chamberlains, and said: \"Hasten to prepare for Queen Paumava\u012b an anointment-ceremony of great richness, [worth, and splendour,] for her withdrawal from the world; and bring me back the report of this my command.\" And they . . . brought back the report. Then Kanhe Vasudeve set Queen Paumava\u012b upon a throne, and performed a great anointment-ceremony for her withdrawal with 108 pitchers of gold\u00b9 . . . decked her with all her ornaments, made her mount upon a litter of a thousand men's burden, and went forth into the midst of the city of B\u0101ravai. He took his way toward the hill Revayae, toward the park Sahassambavanae, and there stopped the litter and made Queen Paumava\u012b alight. Then he took his way toward the Saint Aritthanemi, thrice walked round him from right to right, praised and worshipped him, and said: \"This, sir, is my chief consort, Queen Paumava\u012b, agreeable . . . [rare as the udumbara-blossom even for hearing,] much more for seeing. So I bestow on thee, Beloved of the Gods, the gift of a disciple; prithee accept it; if it please thee . . .\"\n\nThereupon Queen Paumava\u012b departed to the north-eastern side, and with her own hands doffed her ornaments, garlands, and finery, with her own hands plucked out her\n\n\u00b9 As above, p. 43, the bulk of which passage is to be repeated here, mutatis mutandis.\nhair in five handfuls, and went toward the Saint Arittha-\n\u1e47em\u012b, praised and worshipped him . . . So the Saint\nArittha\u1e47em\u012b himself took Queen Paum\u0101vai into the Order,\nhimself made her pluck out her hair, himself gave her\nas disciple to the nun Jakkhi\u1e47\u012b. The nun Jakkhi\u1e47\u012b took\nQueen Paum\u0101vai into the Order . . . So Queen Paum\u0101vai\nbecame a nun, heedful in walking . . . guarded in con-\ntinence. And now the nun Paum\u0101vai, in the presence\nof the nun Jakkhi\u1e47\u012b, studied the Laws of Peace and\nothers, likewise the Eleven Scriptures, and abode exer-\ncising herself by many fasts until the fourth, sixth, and\neighth meal, in divers mortifications. Then the nun\nPaum\u0101vai, having fulfilled the period of nunship for\ntwenty full years, wasted herself away in a month\u2019s starva-\ntion, withheld from herself sixty meals, and so . . . fulfilled\nthe end for which she had stripped herself, and with her\nlast breaths was beatified.\u201d\n\nThus ends the first lesson in the fifth chapter.\n\n\u201cIn those days . . . the city B\u0101rava\u012b, the hill Revayae,\nthe park Nanda\u1e47avane.

Gor\u012b went forth\u201d (in the same manner as\nPaum\u0101vai). \u201cThe Law was preached. The congregation\nwent back, likewise Kanhe.

The story is to be told of Kimkamme in the same wise, until \"he was beatified on Viule.\" The usual conclusion is added for the second lesson.)\n\n(For the third lesson the usual introduction is to be inserted.) \"In those days . . . the city R\u0101yagihe, the sanctuary Gu\u1e47asilae, the king Senie, the queen Cellan\u0101. Here in R\u0101yagihe dwelt a garland-maker named Ajjunae, rich . . . unsurpassed; and he had a wife named Bandhumai, who was delicate . . . Now Ajjunae had without the city of R\u0101yagihe a great flower-garden, black . . . like a mass of mighty clouds, with flowers of the five colours . . . comely. Some way from this flower-garden was a fairy's shrine sacred to the fairy Moggara-p\u0101n\u012b, that had belonged to Ajjunae's grandfather, great-grandfather, and great-great-grandfather, that had passed through a line of many men of his race, ancient, divine, truth-telling\" (and so forth, like Punna-bhadde). \"In it there stood a figure of the fairy Moggara-p\u0101n\u012b holding a great iron mace a thousand palas in weight. Ajjunae from childhood had been a worshipper of the fairy Moggara-p\u0101n\u012b. Every morning he would take baskets and cloths, set forth from the city of R\u0101yagihe, and, making his way toward the flower-garden, would pluck flowers; with the chiefest and best flowers he would approach the fairy-shrine of the fairy Moggara-p\u0101n\u012b and make flower-offerings of great worth, fall upon his knees, and do reverence; then after this he would carry on his trade in the high-road.\n\nIn this city of R\u0101yagihe there dwelt a gang called The\n\n1 In the text the epithet 'garland-maker' is constantly added after the name of Ajjunae.\n2 See above, p. 4f.\n3 See above, p. 3-4.\nElegant, rich... unsurpassed, to whom all that might be was right. Now it befell that a holiday was proclaimed in the city of R\u0101yagihe. So Ajju\u1e47ae, seeing that there would be need on the morrow for very many flowers, took baskets and cloths in the early morning together with his wife Bandhumai, set out from his house, went forth into the midst of the city of R\u0101yagihe, took his way toward the flower-garden, and with his wife Bandhumai plucked flowers. Now six fellows of the Elegant gang took their way toward the fairy-shrine of the fairy Moggara-pa\u00f1i, and disported themselves therein; and when Ajju\u1e47ae with his wife Bandhumai, having plucked flowers and filled his baskets, with the chiefest and best flowers approached the fairy-shrine of the fairy Moggara-pa\u00f1i, the six fellows of the gang beheld Ajju\u1e47ae with his wife Bandhumai coming thither, and said one to another: \"Yonder, Beloved of the Gods, is Ajju\u1e47ae the garland-maker coming hitherward, with his wife Bandhumai; now, in sooth, it is best for us, Beloved of the Gods, to bind Ajju\u1e47ae cross-locked\\(^1\\) and to work our full pleasure upon his wife Bandhumai.\" So they agreed upon this matter, hid themselves behind the doors, and stood silent, without motion or quiver, in covert. Then Ajju\u1e47ae with his wife Bandhumai approached the fairy-shrine of Moggara-pa\u00f1i, and on observation did reverence; he made a flower-offering of great worth, fell on his knees, and did reverence. Then the fellows of the gang suddenly came out from behind the doors, seized Ajju\u1e47ae, bound him cross-locked, and worked their full pleasure upon the garland-maker's wife Bandhumai. Then in Ajju\u1e47ae there arose the following... [thought]: \"Verily I have been from childhood a worshipper of my lord the fairy Moggara-pa\u00f1i... Now if the fairy Moggara-pa\u00f1i were present\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Bound by having his arms and head twisted backwards and held there by cords. The word is avau\u1e0daya-bandha\u1e47a, which seems to represent Sanskrit avaku\u1e6daka-bandhana (so the Comm., who suggests derivation from either ku\u1e6d or mu\u1e6d; cf. Pischel, Gramm. d. Prakrit-sprachen, \u00a7 232); on the other hand, Leumann on Ovaya\u012b renders the apparently connected av\u0101u\u1e0da-b. as 'stripped and bound.'\nhere, could he behold me falling into such ill-fortune? Then the fairy Moggara-p\u0101n\u012b is not present here; 'tis plain this is but a log.\" Then the fairy Moggara-p\u0101n\u012b, marking this . . . [thought] of Ajjunae, entered into Ajjunae's body, burst his bonds with a crash, seized the iron mace of a thousand palas' weight, and smote down the six fellows together with the woman.\n\nAnd now Ajjunae, possessed by the fairy Moggara-p\u0101n\u012b, went on smiting down every day round about the city of R\u0101yagihe six men together with a woman. Then in the open places . . . of the city of R\u0101yagihe [arose a great cry of folk . . .] a many folk, declaring . . . thus one to another: \"Verily, Beloved of the Gods, Ajjunae the garland-maker, possessed by the fairy Moggara-p\u0101n\u012b, is going on smiting down every day without the city of R\u0101yagihe six men together with a woman.\" King Senie, hearing the matter of this tale, summoned his chamberlains, and said: \"Verily, Beloved of the Gods, Ajjunae the garland-maker . . . is going on smiting down [every day . . . six men together with a woman]. Therefore make proclamation twice and thrice that none go forth wandering free for wood or grass or water or flowers and fruit, lest ruin befall his body; and straightway bring back the report of this my [command].\" The chamberlains . . . brought back the report.\n\nNow there dwelt in this city of R\u0101yagihe a merchant named Sudamsane, rich . . . This Sudamsane was a worshipper of the Ascetic, comprehending living and lifeless being\u00b9 . . . In those days . . . the Ascetic arrived.

I will go and offer praise to the Ascetic . . . and wait\nbefore him.\" Then his father and mother said to the\nmerchant Sudamsane: \"Verily, son, Ajjunae the garland-\nmaker is going on smiting down [every day . . . six men\ntogether with a woman]; therefore go thou not forth, son, to\noffer praise to the Ascetic, lest ruin befall thy body. Here\nstay thou, and give praise and worship to the Ascetic.\"\nBut the merchant Sudamsane said to his father and\nmother: \"Should I stay here and give praise to the\nAscetic who is come here, arrived here, making a visit\nhere? Nay, I will go, with your leave, father and mother,\nto give praise to the Ascetic.\" Then, as his father and\nmother could not prevail upon the merchant Sudamsane\nwith many declarations . . . they said: \"If it please\nthee, [make no stay].\" Then Sudamsane, having been\ngiven leave by his father and mother, bathed, put on\nfestive clean garments of state . . . decked his body with\nornaments of small and great worth, sallied forth from\nhis house, and set out on foot to go into the midst of the\ncity of R\u0101yagihe; then he set forth to go toward Gu\u1e47asilae,\ntoward the Ascetic, some way from the fairy-shrine of the\nfairy Moggara-p\u0101\u1e47\u012b.\n\nNow the fairy Moggara-p\u0101\u1e47\u012b beheld Sudamsane the\nworshipper of the Ascetic passing some way from him, and\nfell into a rage. Swinging his iron mace of a thousand\npalas' weight, he set forth to go toward Sudamsane. Then\nSudamsane beheld the fairy Moggara-p\u0101\u1e47\u012b approaching,\nand without fear, dread, terror, horror, disturbance, or\nalarm he wiped the ground with the end of his robe,\n[raised his hands with joined] palms, and said, \"Homage\nto the Saints . . . homage to the Ascetic\u00b9 . . ! Already\n\n\u00b9 Supply the rest as above, p. 11. In substance this declaration\nmeans that Sudamsane, who has already professed and practised the\nin the presence of the Ascetic I have renounced for all my life gross harm to living things, gross falsehood, gross taking of goods not given; I have been content with my own wife; I have made gross limitation of possessions;\u00b9 and now in his presence I renounce for all my life all harm to living beings, falsehood, taking of goods not given, lying with woman, and possession of goods; now in his presence I renounce for all my life all wrath . . . and sting of false vision; I renounce for all my life all the four kinds of food, meat, drink, sweets, and dainties. If I be delivered from this vexation, it is my duty to continue therein; if I be not delivered from this vexation, thus I have made renunciation.\u201d So saying, he took upon himself to observe the complete Standard.\u00b2 Now the fairy Moggara-p\u0101\u1e47\u012b approached Sudam\u1e63a\u1e47e, the worshipper of the Ascetic, swinging his iron mace of a thousand palas\u2019 weight; but he could not reach Sudam\u1e63a\u1e47e because of his potency. And as he could not reach Sudam\u1e63a\u1e47e because of his potency, though he prowled all round about him, he came to a halt before Sudam\u1e63a\u1e47e, without looking to the quarters or the cross-quarters, and gazed long upon him with a fixed stare. Then he left the body of Ajjunae, and went back by the way that he had come, taking with him the iron mace of a thousand palas\u2019 weight.\n\nAbandoned by the fairy Moggara-p\u0101\u1e47\u012b, Ajjunae fell with a crash in a heap on the ground. Then Sudam\u1e63a\u1e47e, the worshipper of the Ascetic, seeing that he was free from the vexation, went on with the Standard. In a short time afterward Ajjunae came back to his senses, and rose up,\n\n\u00b9 Or \u2018of desires,\u2019 according to MS. Brit.

The Ascetic preached before Sudamsane and Ajjunae... doctrine. Sudamsane went back. But Ajjunae, having heard and listened to the doctrine from the Ascetic, became glad... [and said]: \"I believe in the Niggantha doctrine, sir... I undertake the Niggantha doctrine, sir... if it please thee, Beloved of the Gods...\" Thereupon Ajjunae [departed...] to the north-eastern side of him, with his own hands plucked out his hair in five handfuls... became a friar... and abode [observing this Niggantha doctrine].\n\nOn the same day that Friar Ajjunae shaved his head and went into the Order, he praised and worshipped the Ascetic, and took upon himself the following vow: \"It is proper for me that for all my life I should abide exercising myself in constant mortification with fasts until the sixth meal.\" So he abode with this vow upon him for all his life. When the time came round for allowing himself the sixth meal, he read his own lection in the first watch\" (and so forth, as the Lord Goyame did,1 until) \"and went round... Now as Friar Ajjunae was going round in the city of R\u0101yagihe to the higher, the lower, [and the middle orders...], many women, men, young folk, old folk, and youths said: \"This is he who slew my father, he that slew my mother, that slew my brother, sister, wife, son, daughter, daughter-in-law, that slew others of my stock,\n\n1 See above, p. 64.\nrelations, and retainers.\u201d So some abused him, some reviled him, some chided him, some gibed at him, some rebuked him, some threatened him, some struck him. But Friar Ajjunae, abused . . . by these many women, men . . . had not even a thought of wrath against them, and bore it with due patience, due humility, due forbearance, due long-suffering; and duly patient . . . he went round in the city of R\u0101yagihe to the higher, the lower, and the middle orders, getting not drink if he got food, and getting not food if he got drink. So Friar Ajjunae went round, neither sorrowful nor dispirited nor gloomy nor disturbed nor despairing nor wearying in self-control, sallied forth from the city of R\u0101yagihe, took his way toward the sanctuary of Gunasilae, toward the Ascetic\u201d (and so forth, just as the Lord Goyame,\\(^1\\) until) \u201cshowed [him his food and drink], and having been given leave by the Ascetic, rose up . . . and took by himself his food as a snake taking to its hole.\\(^2\\)\n\nNow it befell that the Ascetic sallied forth from the city of R\u0101yagihe to travel in lands beyond. Then Friar Ajjunae fulfilled the period of friarship, many full semesters, exercising himself with this noble . . . mortification, wasted himself away in a half-month\u2019s starvation, withheld from himself thirty meals, and so . . . fulfilled the end . . . and . . . was beatified.\u201d\n\n\\(^1\\) Bhag., fol. 192.\n\n\\(^2\\) A snake gliding into its hole does not let its flanks graze the sides of the hole; and the friar eating food does not allow it to arouse any feelings of relish or the reverse, but swallows it in utter indifference. Thus the Comm.; and we may compare the rule forbidding monks to roll their food from one side of the mouth to the other in order to enjoy its taste (\\(\u0100y\u0101r.\\), I. vii. 6, 2).

Now on the day that Friar Sunakkhatte shaved his head in the presence of the Ascetic and went forth . . . he took upon himself a vow\" (and so forth, until) \"he took by himself his food like [a snake taking] to its hole, and abode [exercising himself] with constraints . . .

As is apparent, the narratives which are abbreviated by the use of jah\u0101 and taheva often show nominatives in -o, as do also the colophons of the several sections, whereas the full text regularly has the older nominative in -e. These passages and their immediate context I have therefore treated uniformly, and sometimes rather arbitrarily, as belonging to the secondary Prakrit, and imposed upon them the nominative in -o throughout, printing them in italics. Uniformity in the use of intervocalic g and y (representing Sanskrit k) has not been sought by me; probably it never existed. The sounds were almost identical, as they are in some dialects of Germany; and though doubtless Jain writers had preferences in certain connections, they never established a general rule.\nIndian Institute at Oxford.

E has the same epithets as A, except jinenam, but in different order.\n7 Disijjati A.\n8 A Sanskrit colophon follows.\nAPPENDIX II.\n\nNOTE ON THE JAIN COSMOGRAPHY.\n\nThe earth, according to the Jains, is a flat round surface formed of concentric circles separated one from another by circular seas, with the continent of Jamb\u016b-dv\u012bpa in the centre. Jamb\u016b-dv\u012bpa is surrounded by the \"Salt Sea\"; the latter by the continent of Dh\u0101tak\u012b-kha\u1e47\u1e0da; this again by the \"Black Sea\"; around this lie successively the continents of Pu\u1e63kara-vara, Varu\u1e47a-vara, K\u1e63\u012bra-vara (i.e., \"Good Milk\"), Ghrta-vara (i.e., \"Good Butter\"), Ik\u1e63u-vara (i.e., \"Good Sugar-cane\"), Nand\u012b\u015bvara, Aru\u1e47a-vara, and many others, each of which is encircled by a sea of the same name, the last continent being Svayambh\u016b-rama\u1e47a.\n\nThe geography of Jamb\u016b-dv\u012bpa, the centre of this system, will be understood from the accompanying diagram, in which the black lines drawn across the circle represent mountain-ranges, the dotted lines rivers. In the centre is Mount Meru (Z). The segment BPQRA is Bharata-var\u1e63a, or India, cut by AQ, Mount Vait\u0101\u1e0dhya, and bounded by BP, Mount Himavat. To it corresponds exactly KGHSJ on the north, which forms the continent of Air\u0101vata, where GK is Mount \u015aikhar\u012b and HJ another Vait\u0101\u1e0dhya. The zone CBPO is Haimavata, and the corresponding GFLK is Hairanyakavata; CO is Mount Mah\u0101-himavat, FL is Mount Rukm\u012b. DCON is called Hari-var\u1e63a, and its boundary DN is Mount Ni\u1e63adha; the corresponding zone FEML is Ramyaka, and EM is Mount N\u012bla. EDNM is called Videha. It contains on the south of Mount Meru Deva-kuru-k\u1e63etra, on the north Uttara-kuru-k\u1e63etra. Two lines of Vait\u0101\u1e0dhya mountains run through its eastern and western regions from east to west, one bisecting the northern half, the other the southern half. The mountains marked by small circles on the map, around which the rivers turn at right angles to their former\ncourses, are also Vait\u0101dhyas, except Z. The little squares in the mountain-ranges, through which the rivers run, denote lakes.\n\nThe total diameter of Jamb\u016b-dv\u012bpa is 100,000 yojanas. The maximum width of Bharata-var\u1e63a, like that of Air\u0101vata-var\u1e63a, is $526\\frac{6}{15}$ yojanas; that of Haimavata and that of Haira\u1e47yavata are each $1052\\frac{12}{15}$ yojanas; that of Hari\nand that of Ramyaka are each $2105\\frac{5}{19}$ yojanas; and that of Videha is $4210\\frac{1}{19}$ yojanas. At each of the extremities of the Himavat and \u015aikhar\u012b ranges (B, P, G, K) there are two great spits of land jutting out for 300 yojanas into the sea, towards the cross-quarters of the compass, each divided into seven parts. These are the eight Antaradv\u012bpas, in which dwell barbarians. Bharata, Air\u0101vata, and Videha (with the exception of the Deva-kuru and Uttara-kuru districts) are called \"Karma-bh\u016bmis,\" because t\u012brthakaras are born and beatified there; the rest of Jamb\u016b-dv\u012bpa, together with the Deva-kurus and Uttara-kurus, is inhabited by Yugalis or giants.\n\nThe mention of Pa\u1e47\u1e0du-mahur\u0101 in our text (p. 81) is interesting. By this name is evidently meant the southern city of Madura, where the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0diya\u1e47 dynasty was ruling in the fifth century B.C., and probably earlier. The P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0diya\u1e47s, however, were not P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0davas; and the Jain identification of the two dynasties is probably based on popular etymology. A like attempt to connect the two families occurs in the Tamil chronicle given in Taylor's 'Oriental Historical Manuscripts,' vol. i., p. 195 et seq., which states that Madura in the time of the wars of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata was ruled by Babhruv\u0101hana, son of Arjuna by the daughter of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0diya\u1e47 king of Madura. The Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, on the other hand, makes Babhruv\u0101hana son of Arjuna by Citr\u0101\u1e45gad\u0101, daughter of Citrav\u0101hana, the king of Manip\u016bra. It may also be noted that the old Tamil poets call the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0diya\u1e47 kings pa\u00f1cavan and kauriyan.\n\nOne of the bases of this fantastic geography is the peculiar Jain theory of the solar system. Jain maps of the world mark the place of the sun at E, N, a, and d, that of the moon at D, M, b, and c. \"They start from the theory that in the course of twenty-four hours the sun, as well as the other heavenly bodies, can traverse only half of the circle around Meru; hence, when the night ends in Bharata-var\u1e63a, the sun whose light gave the previous day has just arrived at the north-west of Meru. Hence the sun which actually rises at this very time in the east of\nBharata-var\u1e63a cannot be the same sun which set on the previous evening, but is another sun, which is however indistinguishable to the eye from the first. On the morning of the third day appears again the first sun, which by this time has reached the south-eastern corner of Meru, and so on. For the same reason, the Jains assume two moons, two series of nak\u1e63atras, etc. All the heavenly bodies are thus duplicated.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe earth and its planetary system, however, form but a small part of the regions which Jain cosmography undertakes to describe. Its theory may be understood from the accompanying diagram,\\(^2\\) representing the series of worlds under the figure of a woman, whose waist is formed by our earth. Below our earth are seven other earths of gradually increasing magnitude, called Ratnaprabh\u0101, \u0160arkar\u0101prabha, V\u0101luk\u0101prabha (see p. 81), Pankaprabh\u0101, Dh\u016bmaprabh\u0101, Tamahprabh\u0101, and Mah\u0101tamahprabh\u0101. In the midst of each of these lower earths lie hells, narakas or nirayas.\n\nSome distance above our earth begins the series of celestial spheres. These comprise twelve kalpas, which, in ascending order beginning from the kalpa nearest to us, are styled Saudharma, Ai\u015b\u0101na, Sanatkum\u0101ra, M\u0101hendra, Brahmaloka, L\u0101ntaka, Mah\u0101\u015bukra, Sahasr\u0101ra, \u0100nata, Pr\u0101\u1e47ata, \u0100r\u0101\u1e47a, and Acyuta,\\(^3\\) which form the bust of the figure in the diagram; a series of nine regions called Graiveyas, which form the collar; and lastly the five Anuttara-vim\u0101nas\u2014Vijaya, Vaijayanta, Jayanta, Apar\u0101jita, and Sarv\u0101rtha-siddha\u2014which constitute the crown of the figure, above which the world tapers to an end in the region styled \u012a\u015bat-pr\u0101gbh\u0101ra, which is shaped like an umbrella, and is tenanted by the redeemed souls. These regions are supposed to contain palaces, vim\u0101nas, tenanted by the Vaim\u0101nika gods. The first eight kalpas, taken in\n\n---\n\n1 Thibaut, \u2018Astronomie, Astrologie, und Mathematik,\u2019 in B\u00fchler\u2019s Grundriss, pp. 21, 22.\n2 Taken from Padmavijaya\u2019s Samar\u0101ditya-Keval\u012b-n\u0101 R\u0101s, published at Bombay in 1882.\n3 For the Prakrit names of these, see p. 110.\nthe same order as above, contain respectively 32 lakhs of vim\u0101nas, 28 lakhs, 12 lakhs, 8 lakhs, 4 lakhs, 50,000, 40,000, 6,000; \u0100nata and Pr\u0101\u1e47ata together have 400, \u0100ra\u1e47a and Acyuta together 300; the three series of the nine Graiveyas have respectively 111, 107, and 100, and the five Anuttara-vim\u0101nas have 1 each, the total being 97,023.\\(^1\\)\n\n**APPENDIX III.**\n\n**Note of the Jain Doctrine of Psychology.**\n\nJain philosophy divides the whole of Being into (1) soul (*j\u012bva*), (2) merit (*dharma*), (3) demerit (*adharma*), (4) ether (*\u0101k\u0101\u015ba*), and (5) atoms (*pudgala*), to which some add time.\\(^2\\)\n\n\u201cMerit\u201d is a cosmic principle or force acting as the ground for the motion of atoms and souls, being in the same relation to them as water to the fish swimming through it; \u201cdemerit\u201d is another principle on which is based their rest, being in the same relation to them as a tree to a traveller who sits under it. Ether has the property of pervading all space (both *loka*, the universe, which is filled by \u201cmerit,\u201d \u201cdemerit,\u201d etc., and *aloka*, the Void, which contains only ether), and of making room for atoms and souls.\n\nSoul is described in a manner that strongly reminds us of the Ved\u0101nta. It is in essence pure intelligence, *cetan\u0101*, characterised by the property of energy, *upayoga*; but in course of time it suffers infection (*\u0101srava*) from foreign matter or material \u201cwork\u201d (*dravya-karma*). On its\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Much information on these subjects will be found in the Bhagavat\u012b, xi., etc.; Um\u0101sv\u0101ti\u2019s Tattv\u0101rtha-s\u016btra-bh\u0101\u1e63ya, bks. iii., iv.; the numerous k\u1e63etra-sam\u0101sas and samgraha\u1e47\u012bs of other Jain authors; and Colebrooke\u2019s \u2018Miscellaneous Essays,\u2019 new edition, vol. ii., p. 197 et seq.\n\n\\(^2\\) See Tattv\u0101rtha-s\u016btra-bh\u0101\u1e63ya, bk. ii.; Kundakunda\u2019s Panc\u0101stik\u0101ya-samaya-s\u0101ra, with commentary (Bombay edition, 1904); Jaina-tattv\u0101dar\u015ba (Hindi edition, p. 207 et seq.), etc.\nrelations to this foreign matter depend the soul\u2019s moods (bh\u0101va). Matter in contact with the soul causes a discoloration of its primitive translucence, which assumes the forms of passion, wrath, or error. Under the influence of these, matter develops four moods of soul (bh\u0101va-karma). When the matter in contact with the soul comes into active operation upon it, the mood is called audayika. When this process ceases, the mood is aupasamika. When the activity of matter is partly nascent and partly ceasing, the mood is k\u1e63\u0101yopasamika. When the foreign matter is being entirely dissipated, the mood is k\u1e63\u0101yika. A fifth mood, in which the soul energises in its own essential purity without influence of matter, is called parin\u0101mika.\\(^1\\) Throughout all these phases, however, the soul is strictly passive in relation to matter. It is an agent only in relation to its own modifications in these processes. Its salvation (mukti, mok\u1e63a) consists in a total removal of these external influences and in the free exercise of its essential, pure, absolute intelligence.\n\nThe soul\u2019s energy, upayoga, takes the forms of \u201cknowledge,\u201d jn\u0101na, and \u201cvision,\u201d dar\u015bana. The first consists of the definite apprehension of particular objects (sa-vikalpa), the latter of indefinite apprehension or intuition of general ideas (nir-vikalpa). In the course of time, as matter defiles the soul, it produces on it jn\u0101navaran\u012bya karma, perverting its knowledge. On the partial dissipation of this karma (k\u1e63ayopasama; see above) the soul by the exercise of the physical organs and the manas or thought-organ obtains mati-jn\u0101na or abhinibodhika-jn\u0101na, in which it has an imperfect apprehension, in the forms of individuality, of corporeal and incorporeal substances. When again this karma is partially dissipated and the soul exercises the thought-organ, it obtains \u015bruta-jn\u0101na, an imperfect apprehension of corporeal and incorporeal substances in individual forms. When again this karma is partially dispelled and the soul imperfectly apprehends corporeal substances only in individual forms, this is avadhi-jn\u0101na (Prakrit ohi-n\u0101\u1e47a;\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf. the term parin\u0101ma on p. 75.\nWhen this *karma* is partially dispelled and the soul imperfectly apprehends concepts of corporeal substances in the minds of others in individual forms, this is *manah-pary\u0101ya-jn\u0101na*. When however this *karma* is entirely dissipated, and the soul apprehends universally all corporeal and incorporeal substances in individual forms, this is its essential \"absolute knowledge,\" *kevala-jn\u0101na*.\n\nTo the above definitions of Kundakunda and his commentators we append some remarks based on the Tattv\u0101rtha-s\u016btra-bh\u0101\u1e63ya.\n\nThe Tattv\u0101rtha-s\u016btra i. 13 groups together the functions of *mati*, *sm\u1e5bti*, *samj\u00f1\u0101*, *cint\u0101*, and *abhinibodha*, which Sad\u0101sukha *in loco* distinguishes thus\u2014*sm\u1e5bti* is a resuscitation of a concept without the sight of the object which originally aroused it; *samj\u00f1\u0101* is a resuscitation of the concept when the object is again seen; *cint\u0101* (*tarka* or *vy\u0101pti*) is the constant mental association of the *s\u0101dhya* or predicate of the syllogism with the *s\u0101dhan\u0101* or middle term; *abhinibodha* (*anum\u0101na*) is the function of inference from the connection of the middle term with the subject of the syllogism. The process of *mati-jn\u0101na* is analysed in the Tattv\u0101rtha-s\u016btra i. 15 thus. After a mere indeterminate impression of the existence of the object, we have first *avagraha*, *i.e.*, a definite impression of generic quality in it, *e.g.*, whiteness, humanity. Next comes *\u012bh\u0101*, a process of inquiry starting from certain of the data already attained\u2014*e.g.*, an inquiry whether the white object is to be conceived specifically as a banner or a line of cranes, or whether the human being is a Karn\u0101\u1e6da, L\u0101\u1e6da, etc. Then come *ap\u0101ya* or *av\u0101ya*, in which we decide to accept the result of the inquiry as correct, and lastly *dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101*, the final form in which the concept thus accepted is established in the mind for future use.\\(^1\\)\n\nThese definitions have an important bearing upon our text, p. 18. There we have the terms *avagraha* (\"he took cognisance,\" *ogg\u012bnhai*), *\u012bh\u0101* (\"entered into inquiry,\" *\u012bham*).\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See also Pram\u0101\u1e47a-naya-tattv\u0101lok\u0101lambak\u0101ra, II. 6 *et seq.*, with J\u00f1\u0101nacandra's commentary.\nparisai), and mati (mai-puvenam buddhi-vinn\u0101ne\u1e47am, \u201cwith faculty of intelligence arising from perception,\u201d glossed as \u0101bhinibodhika-prabhavena mati-vi\u015be\u1e63a-bh\u016btautpattiky\u0101di-buddhi-r\u016bpa-paricchedena).\n\n\u015aruta-jn\u0101na is knowledge derived from the Scriptures or from the writings and teachings of the heads of the Church.\\(^1\\)\n\nOn the exact meaning of avadhi-jn\u0101na controversy has raged. It may be broadly defined as a supernatural perception of visible objects which proceeds directly from the soul without the mediation of the bodily organs; it is congenital in gods and denizens of the hells, and may be occasionally acquired by men and lower animals.\n\nKevala-jn\u0101na (see p. 75) is the unlimited knowledge of the saint in the highest stage of illumination, extending over every class and phase of matter and spirit in the world.\\(^2\\) It arises on the dissipation of the influences of the mohaniya, jn\u0101navaran\u012bya, dar\u015ban\u0101varan\u012bya, and antar\u0101ya karmas (p. 51). For a short time the saint remains in bodily life, while the force of his \u0101yuk-karma constrains him to experience a last remnant of good karma. At length these vanish, and he attains mok\u1e63a, complete emancipation.\n\nThere is a similar series of the modes of \u201cvision.\u201d The soul contracts dar\u015ban\u0101varan\u012bya karma; on the partial dissipation of this arises (1) cak\u1e63ur-dar\u015bana, when the eye imperfectly apprehends in general forms corporeal substances; (2) acak\u1e63ur-dar\u015bana, when there is imperfect apprehension in general forms of corporeal and incorporeal substances by means of the other physical organs or thought-organ; and (3) avadhi-dar\u015bana, when there is imperfect apprehension in general forms of corporeal substances. To kevala-jn\u0101na corresponds kevala-dar\u015bana.\n\nAn important chapter of Jain epistemology is that dealing with the Nayas, the various modes of ratiocination by which,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The Jains do not admit anum\u0101na, upam\u0101na, arth\u0101patti, \u0101gama, sambhava, and abh\u0101va as independent modes of acquiring knowledge, pram\u0101\u1e47as, but group them under mati-jn\u0101na and \u015bruta-jn\u0101na.\n\n\\(^2\\) See Hoernle\u2019s translation of Uv\u0101s., p. 48, and App., p. 44, with the authorities there cited; Tattv\u0101rtha-s\u016btra-bh\u0101\u1e63ya, i. 9 et seq. and x.\nas contrasted with the higher or intuitive metaphysical knowledge, the thinker forms partially true conceptions of reality.\\(^1\\) They are based on the division of ideas (artha) into \"generic concepts\" (s\u0101m\u0101nya, the common attribute constituting a class, yet really existent in the individuals of the class, such as substantiality, cognisability, etc.), and \"particular concepts\" (vi\u015be\u1e63a, distinguishing one individual from others of the same class). In the first, or naigama naya, the thinker comprehends objects as characterised by both generic and particular concepts, without regard to the uniformity of the terms employed to denote the objects. In the second, or sa\u1e43graha naya, he views the objects as essentially generic concepts, regarding particular concepts as implied in generic. The third, or vyavah\u0101ra naya, is the reverse process of thought, regarding the generic concepts as real only in so far as they are associated with the particular. In the fourth, or rju-s\u016btra naya, the thinker conceives objects as existent solely in present time, for it is only to such that we can attribute action relative to others, and hence reality. In the fifth, or \u015babda naya, he regards the object denoted by terms of different grammatical form (e.g., \"jar,\" \"pot,\" \"jug\") as the same. In the sixth, or samabhiri\u1e0dha naya, on the contrary, he attaches a different idea to every synonym corresponding to its etymology; these verbal differences between synonyms, he argues, correspond to real differences between the objects denoted by the terms, similar to the difference between gha\u1e6da (jar) and pa\u1e6da (cloth). In the seventh, or evam-bh\u016bta naya, he regards the object, though expressed by a single term, as real only in so far as it is performing the functions denoted by the term\u2014e.g., a jar (gha\u1e6da) is real only in so far as it contains (gha\u1e6danam) water; for otherwise the term pa\u1e6da might be applied equally well to the gha\u1e6da.\n\n\\(^1\\) These are discussed in the Tattv\u0101rtha-s\u016btra-bh\u0101sya and other commentaries on Tattv\u0101rtha-s\u016btra, i. 34 et seq., and in the Pram\u0101\u1e47a-naya-tattv\u0101lok\u0101lamk\u0101ra, vii. A good popular exposition is to be found in Vinayavijaya's Naya-k\u0101rik\u0101, with Gambhiravijaya's commentary. The Digambaras differ somewhat in their explanation of the terms.\nADDENDA.\n\nP. 12, Note 3: On the dimensions of the *yojana* see Journ. Royal Asiatic Society, 1906, p. 1011 ff.\n\nP. 13, Note 3: The history of Arit\u1e6dhanem\u012b is given in the Uttar\u0101dhyayana xxii.

Afterwards, finding that the city of Mathur\u0101 was being constantly attacked by Jar\u0101sandha, K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a founded the city of Dv\u0101rak\u0101 or Dv\u0101ravat\u012b (B\u0101rava\u012b), and settled the Yadu princes in it.\n\nP. 24, Note 1: Bharata was the eldest son of \u1e5a\u1e63abha, the first *tirthakara*; his residence was in Vin\u012bt\u0101 or Ayodhy\u0101 (not the classical town of that name).\n\nP. 47: It is possible that the word *siy\u0101*, here translated \u201clitter,\u201d denotes rather a car similar to the enormous vehicles which are used to convey images of gods in procession\u2014for example, those of Puri and the southern temples.\n\nP. 53: The *sinduv\u0101ra* flower is the *Vitex trifolia*, a variety of the *Vitex negundo* with pale blue blossoms.\n\nP. 63, Note 2: Nalak\u016bvara, though several times mentioned, is little more than a name in Sanskrit literature. It is, however, worth noting that he figures in Tibetan magic under the name *Narakuvara*, and the Tibetan Kanjur contains a translation of a lost Sanskrit work styled *Mah\u0101-yak\u1e63a-sen\u0101pati-narakuvara-kalpa*, \u201cRitual of the Great Fairy General Narakuvara,\u201d according to which he is the leader\nof the army of his father Vai\u015brava\u1e47a. It is hard to say which is the more primitive form of the name; and the Tibetan translators have added to the difficulty by rendering the word by Gar mk\u2019an mc\u2019og, \u201cthe excellent Dancer,\u201d doubtless deriving naraku from the root nr, \u201cto dance.\u201d Whatever be the correctness of this etymology, the Tantric attribute of dancing is appropriate in the circle of deities to which Vai\u015brava\u1e47a and his son belong; for example, Kurukull\u0101, the wife of K\u0101ma-deva or Cupid, and hence a Tantric form of the classical Rati, is also figured as a dancer.\n\nP. 70: Compare with this transformation the process described in the Tiru-p\u0101vai xxiii. When about to create the universe anew from himself, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u first assumes materiality, without being as yet determined into formal and cogitable being (n\u0101ma-r\u016bpa), and extends himself like a long rod, then as a huge mass passes from the condition of primitive matter (prak\u1e5bti) into that of mahat or buddhi, from which the universe is evolved in accordance with S\u0101\u1e41khya doctrine.\n\nP. 118: The word sinh\u0101lae is glossed by Abh. (somewhat corruptly in the MS. Brit. Mus. Or. 5130 and 5131) as sisnalakam phala-vi\u0161e\u1e63o yat saphalam iti loka-pratitam. Sisnalaka is apparently concocted to explain the Prakrit sinh\u0101lae. Dr. Hoernle has suggested to me that the latter may represent the Sanskrit \u015b\u1e5b\u1e45g\u0101la or \u015b\u1e5b\u1e45g\u0101lik\u0101, the well-known Batatas paniculata or Ipomoea digitata, the tubers of which sometimes grow to the weight of 40 or 50 pounds. The form sinh\u0101lae, which presupposes a Sanskrit \u015b\u1e5b\u1e45khalaka, he explains from the fact that \u015b\u1e5b\u1e45g\u0101la, as applied to the Asteracantha longifolia, has a secondary form, \u015b\u1e5b\u1e45khali. The word spelt saphala is probably the \u015baphala\u2014i.e., the Citrullus vulgaris (trapusi in the R\u0101janigha\u1e47\u1e6du, p. 428 of Apte\u2019s edition), the ordinary water-melon, commonly known as tarb\u016bs.\nINDEX\n\n(The numbers refer to the pages.)\n\nAbhae, 110-1, 125-6\nabha\u1e45ga, 51\nAbhicande (-dra), 13, 61\nabhiyama, 38\nabhigraha-pratij\u00f1\u0101, 9\nAbhinandan\u0101tha, vi\nabhinibodha, abhinibodhika-jn\u0101na, 142-3\nacak\u1e63ur-dar\u015bana, 144\nAcala (Baladeva), 24\n\u2014 See Ayale\n\u0101c\u0101ra, 53\naccana, 3\nAccue (Acyuta), 60, 110, 125, 140-1\n\u0101d\u0101na-nik\u1e63epa-samiti, 8\n\u0101dh\u016b-karmika food, 42\nadharma.
