I.\u2014Description of Mesopotamia and Baghd\u0101d, written about the year 900 A.D. by Ibn Serapion. The Arabic Text edited from a MS. in the British Museum Library, with Translation and Notes. By Guy Le Strange.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nThe Geography of Mesopotamia during the epoch of the Baghd\u0101d Caliphate has not, I think, received the attention which the subject deserves. With the exception of the small maps found in the Spruner-Menke Atlas, I believe no detailed description or delineation of the country at this date has been attempted. Yet it must be admitted that the history of the Abbasids is almost incomprehensible without such an aid; for the physical and political condition of the country was not then what it is now, as a glance at the accompanying map will show.\n\nThe basis of this map is the description of the two rivers, Euphrates and Tigris, with their affluents and inter-communicating canals, which was written by Ibn Serapion at the beginning of the fourth century A.H., corresponding with the tenth A.D. The text now published for the first time is from the unique MS. of one volume of his work preserved in the British Museum Library (Add. MS. 23,379). Of Ibn Serapion, personally, I believe\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1895.\nnothing is known; the date of his work, however, is fixed by the minute description he has given of Baghdad. Various palaces are described, the latest being the celebrated Ka\u1e63r-at-T\u0101j (the Palace of the Crown), completed by the Caliph Al-Muktafi immediately after his accession in A.H. 289 (902). That Ibn Serapion wrote not later than the first part of the tenth century A.D. is proved by the fact that no mention is made of the palaces which were built in Baghd\u0101d by the Buwayhid princes, subsequent to the year 334 A.H. (945), when Mu'izz-ad-Dawla became master of both the capital and the person of the Caliph.\n\nIn regard to the Topography of ancient Baghd\u0101d\u2014a subject which I hope to take up again and elucidate more fully in a future paper\u2014the information given by Ibn Serapion is of much importance, for it enables us to complete the minute description of the city which we possess in the work of Ya\u1e33\u016bb\u012b, written in A.H. 278 (891), a decade or so before the date of Ibn Serapion. Now Ya\u1e33\u016bb\u012b describes Baghd\u0101d from the centre outwards, going along the main-roads; while, on the other hand, Ibn Serapion follows the course of the canals, beginning above and passing down to where each flows out into the Tigris. It will readily be understood that the canals and the high-roads, for the most part, cross each other, and interlace; hence by plotting out the palaces and quarters described by these two independent authorities, a net-work of points is gained, which, with the main course of the Tigris for a back-bone, enables us to reconstitute the ground-plan of Baghd\u0101d of the times of the Caliphate. This is what I have attempted in my plan, but full details concerning the various buildings given in Ibn Serapion, and of others mentioned by Ya\u1e33\u016bb\u012b must be reserved for a future paper.\n\nIt will be convenient, in this Introduction, briefly to point out how the courses of the Tigris and Euphrates differed in the 10th century A.D. from what is at present found. Ibn Serapion describes the Tigris as rising at a spring and flowing down past \u0100mid, which is proof that\nthe eastern branch of the Tigris (and not the Bitlis river) was that regarded as the main-stream by the Arabs. Down as far as Samarra, the towns given show that the course was then much what it is now. From this place, however, to a point a few miles above Baghd\u0101d, the river followed a shorter and more westerly channel than it does at the present day. The line of this older river-bed\u2014which still has the ruins of the towns named by Ibn Serapion lying on its bank\u2014is marked on our maps. After flowing through Baghd\u0101d and past Al-Mad\u0101in (Ctesiphon), the Tigris passed down to the latitude of K\u016bt-al-Amarah, and here the great alterations in its course are to be noticed. At the present day the Tigris follows an easterly channel down to Korna\u2014this also, as we shall show (see Note 1 to Section xiv.), was its course in Sassanian times\u2014and here its waters join the Euphrates to form the Shatt-al-\u2018Arab or Tidal Estuary of the combined streams. In the days of the Caliphate, however, the Tigris flowed due south from K\u016bt-al-Amarah, running down the channel now known as the Shatt-al-Hay, and passing through the city of W\u0101sit, below which, by various canals and mouths, the stream spread out and became lost in the great Swamp, which is so important a feature in the geography, political and physical, of that epoch. From the great Swamp\u2014into which, as we shall see later, the Euphrates also poured its waters\u2014a canal flowed out direct into the Tidal Estuary, which thus served to drain off the waters of both the Tigris and the Euphrates. This Estuary, after passing to the eastward of \u2018Al-Ba\u1e63ra, finally came to the open sea at \u2018Abbad\u0101n, a town which, on account of the recession of the Persian Gulf, now lies nearly twenty miles distant from the present shore-line. In the account which Ibn Serapion gives of the Estuary of the Dujayl, as he calls the river Karun, there are some matters of importance which will be discussed in the notes appended to my translation.\n\nThe description of the Euphrates presents many points of interest. In the first place the Orientals then, as now, considered what we call the Western Euphrates, which\nrises in the mountains to the north of Erzeroum, as the main arm of the great river. The Eastern Euphrates, now generally called the Mur\u0101d-S\u016b, a name given to it by the Turks, Ibn Serapion and other medieval geographers speak of as the river Arsan\u0101s. This latter name has, apparently, long since fallen into desuetude, but it is evidently identical with the classical Arsanias Flumen, which Pliny describes in the first century after Christ. It is curious to find another classical name, apparently, still in use in the tenth century A.D., although, as in the former case, this also has now been long forgotten; for the Nahr L\u00fckiya, no longer to be found on our modern maps, is doubtless the river Lycus of the Roman geographer.\n\nIn the time of Ibn Serapion, many of the other great tributaries of the Euphrates, as also their secondary affluents, bore names which are evidently not Arabic. As instances I may mention the rivers Salkit, Jarj\u0101riya, and Kar\u0101k\u012bs\u2014possibly there are some others\u2014all of which are now known under Turkish names, but which, in the tenth century A.D., evidently still kept the nomenclature of pre-Islamic times, and thus, in a modified form, preserved the original Greek or native denomination for these streams.\n\nThe main-stream of the Euphrates, after passing out from the mountains, received various affluents in the plain of northern Mesopotamia, and flowing south-east, followed its present course down to a point a short distance north of Al-K\u016bfa. Here the stream bifurcated. The branch to the right\u2014considered then as the main-stream of the Euphrates, but now known as the Hindiyya Canal\u2014ran down past Al-K\u016bfa, and a short distance below this city became lost in the western part of the great Swamp, which has already been spoken of as swallowing up the waters of the Tigris. The stream to the left or eastward, called the S\u016bra Canal\u2014which, in its upper reach, follows the line of the modern Euphrates\u2014ran a short course and then split up into numerous canals whose waters, for the most part, flowed out into the Tigris above W\u0101sit. Those canals which did not join the Tigris above that\ncity, joined its waters lower down, for they all drained into the northern part of the great Swamps.\n\nThe Arabs had inherited from the Persians, their predecessors in Mesopotamia, the system of canalization which joined the lower courses of the Euphrates and the Tigris, making the Saw\u0101d\u2014or Alluvial plain to the south of Takrit and Al-Anb\u0101r\u2014one of the richest countries of the East. A glance at the map will show that the system adopted was to carry off the surplus waters of the Euphrates into the Tigris, for the purpose of irrigating the lands between the two rivers. On the other hand, the waters of the Tigris were, for the most part, tapped by canals on its further or eastern bank, in order more thoroughly to irrigate the lands which lay on the Persian border of its stream. The four great irrigation canals of the Euphrates were the \u1e6c\u012bsa, \u0160arsar, M\u0101lik, and K\u016btha, and these four with the S\u016br\u0101 Canal (flowing eastward from the bifurcation above Al-K\u016bfa) carried off the greater part of the waters of the Euphrates to the Tigris. The distances separating these canals which Ibn Serapion mentions are of great importance, since they enable us to fix their positions. The main canal of the left bank of the Tigris was the great K\u0101\u1e6d\u016bl-Nahraw\u0101n channel, dating from the days of the Chosroes; but a shorter line also existed on the right bank of the Tigris, formed by the Ishaq\u012byya and the Dujayl Canals, and this irrigated the lands immediately to the north of Baghd\u0101d.\n\nWith only a single MS. of the work of Ibn Serapion to consult, the reconstitution of the text has been a matter of some difficulty. Most of the place-names, it is true, occur again either in the works of the contemporary geographers of the third and fourth centuries A.H., or in the later compilations of Y\u0101\u1e33\u016bt and Bakri; but in some instances places are mentioned once only in Ibn Serapion and by no other geographer, and often the reading of our MS. is corrupt or uncertain. For plotting out the names on my map, I have in most cases been able to fix the position of the towns along the various streams by a reference\nto the distances given in the Road-books of Kud\u0101ma and other authorities, taking as fixed points the places therein mentioned which still exist. In the three sections describing the city of Baghd\u0101d, great help has been derived from the work written by Al-Kha\u1e6d\u012bb on the \"History of Baghd\u0101d,\" of which the British Museum possesses three fairly correct MSS. Al-Kha\u1e6d\u012bb has often copied Ibn Serapion verbatim; and some portions of the work of Al-Kha\u1e6d\u012bb have been incorporated by Y\u0101k\u016bt, who thus quotes Ibn Serapion at second-hand; Abul-Fid\u0101 in his geography, on the other hand, appears to have copied some of the text of Ibn Serapion at first-hand.\n\nWith all these aids, however, a few corrupt passages remain over, which I have emended as best I could, and these, with minor verbal additions, have been marked by enclosure in square brackets [ ]. The translation has been made as literal as possible, but to avoid ambiguity the antecedent proper-name has constantly been repeated in place of the pronoun; such additions, however, I have marked by enclosure in parentheses ( ). All dates are given in years of the Hijra; the succeeding, and higher, figures (in parentheses) represent the corresponding dates A.D. I have translated the term Fars\u0101kh by \"league,\" with which measure it practically corresponds; for along roads, and counting the winding course of the rivers, three miles as the crow flies is above, rather than below, the fair estimate of the Fars\u0101kh. The Arab mile (mil), the one used by Ibn Serapion, is equivalent to our nautical mile or knot\u2014that is to say, about one English statute mile and a quarter. It must be remembered, however, that distances in those early days were not measured, but only estimated by time, being counted as so many Fars\u0101khs (the League, or Hour), or so many Mar\u1e25alas (the Day's march); hence the Arab mile may, as a rule, be taken as roughly the equivalent of our mile. On the Map nineteen Fars\u0101khs, or fifty-seven Arab miles, go to the degree of latitude.\n\nI have divided up the text (and the translation) into sections, for convenience in adding the notes. These last\nhave been made as succinct as was compatible with giving translations of short passages from contemporary geographers, whose descriptions enable us to fix distances and positions.\n\nThe text of Ibn Serapion, which I now publish, occupies a little over eleven leaves (22 pages) of the MS., which contains in all 68 leaves of a folio-sized volume, written in a clear hand, and dated A.H. 709 (1309). The beginning of the volume contains a description of the various seas, islands, lakes, and mountains of the world, after which come the rivers. Following on the notice of the Euphrates and Tigris (now published) is a page devoted to a minute description of the course of the Nile, and this contains some curious information. The volume closes with an enumeration of various springs and minor streams. The whole of this volume by Ibn Serapion would, I believe, be well worth translating and editing. Apparently, however, in our present MS. we only possess a portion of the entire work, for Ibn Serapion refers to a chapter \"On the Roads and Ways\" (see Section XIV.), which is nowhere to be found in the volume in the British Museum.\n\nIn conclusion I add a list of the authorities quoted in my notes, with a sufficient bibliography to enable my readers to identify the editions of the texts from which my translations have been made.\n\nIbn Kutayba, wrote about A.H. 250 (864).

I.]\n\nACCOUNT OF THE RIVER TIGRIS FROM ITS SOURCE TO ITS MOUTH.\n\nNow the source of the Tigris is at a spring in longitude 64\u00b0 40', or 65\u00b0, or another (says) 39\u00b0 5', and in latitude 38\u00b0 30'. Passing to longitude 64\u00b0 45', and latitude 37\u00b0 45', with mountains to either side, it flows on even with the mountains to longitude 68\u00b0 5' and latitude 38\u00b0 5', going by the city of \u0100mid, which lies upon the stream. Thence it passes on to Jazira-Ibn-\u2018Omar, surrounding the same, so that the city is as an island in the midst of the stream. Thence it passes to the city of Balad, which lies on its bank; and thence to the city of Al-Maw\u1e63il (Mosul), likewise on the river side. Then it passes by the following: Al-Haditha, As-Sinn, As-S\u016bdak\u0101niyya, Jabilt\u0101, and Takrit. Next it comes to the city of Surra-man-raa (Samarra'), which lies on its bank. After this it passes the following: Al-K\u0101dis\u012bya, Al-Ajama, Al-\u2018Alth, Al-H\u0101zira, A\u1e63-Saw\u0101mi\u2019, \u2018Ukbar\u0101, Aw\u0101n\u0101, Bu\u1e63r\u0101, Baz\u016bgh\u0101, Al-Barad\u0101n, Al-Mazrafa, Ka\u1e6drabbul, Ash-Shamm\u0101siyya, and next divides the City of Peace (Baghd\u0101d), which lies across the river on either bank. After this it runs on to Kalw\u0101dh\u0101, and next to the city of Al-Mad\u0101in, passing through the midst of the same, which lies across on either bank of the stream. After this it flows by the following: As-Sib, Dayr-al-\u2018\u0100k\u016bl, A\u1e63-S\u0101fiya, Dayr Kunna, Hum\u0101niya, Jarjar\u0101y, An-Nu\u2018m\u0101niyya, Jabbul, Nahr S\u0101b\u016bs, Fam-as-\u1e62ilh, and thence it reaches W\u0101sit, passing through the midst of the town, which lies across the stream and on either bank. From here it passes on to the following: Ar-Ru\u1e63\u0101fa, Nahr B\u0101n, Al-F\u0101r\u016bth, Dayr-al-\u2018Umm\u0101l, Al-Haw\u0101n\u012bt, and then in longitude 78\u00b0 5' and latitude 32\u00b0 5' it flows out, at Al-Ka\u1e6dr, into the head of the Swamps, and this same place is in the midst of them.\n\nFurther on, if it please Allah Almighty, I will give an\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1895.\naccount of these Swamps, and a description of the same, and of the streams which fall into them and which flow out of them, but this will be after concluding the subject of the Euphrates, and of the streams lying between it and the Tigris.\n\n1 The Arabs call the Tigris Dijla (without the article), and under this name (with certain modifications of pronunciation) the river has been known in all ages. In the Jewish Targums the word occurs under the form Diglath, which corresponds with the latter part of Hiddekel, the name under which the Tigris is mentioned in Genesis ii. 14.\n\n\u0100mid, the Roman Amida, is the capital of the province of Diyar Bakr. The town is now more generally known by the name of the province, Diyar Bakr, which means \"the habitations of the Bakr,\" an Arab tribe who had already settled here in Sassanian times. Y\u0101k\u016bt (I. 66) says that \u0100mid was a very ancient city, on a height, being built of black stone, from which fact, doubtless, its modern name of Kara (or Black) \u0100mid is derived.\n\nJazira-Ibn-\u2018Omar, \u201cthe island of the son of Omar,\u201d is still a flourishing town. According to Y\u0101k\u016bt (II. 79) it took its name from a certain Al-\u1e24asan Ibn-\u2018Omar of the Taghlib tribe, who founded this place, taking a wife from among the women of the country. The city has the Tigris going round it in a semicircle on the one side, and on the other side a ditch has been dug and filled with water, so that the town stands on an island.\n\nBalad was the first stage, and seven leagues north of Mosul, and therefore at the place now marked by the ruins of Eski Mosul, where the road to \u0100mid and the one running west to Sinj\u0101r forked (Kud\u0101ma, p. 214). According to Y\u0101k\u016bt (I. 715) the name was often written Balat, and it occupied the site of the ancient Persian town of Shahr\u0101b\u0101dh.\nAl-Mawsil (Mosul) became the capital of Upper Mesopotamia under the Omayyads; and Marwan II., the last Caliph of this dynasty, rebuilt the town and surrounded it with walls. According to Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 682) the ancient Persian name of Mosul was Nawardash\u012br or Bawardash\u012br, and opposite, across the river, were the ruins of Nineveh.\n\nBetween Mosul and Baghd\u0101d the high road lay along the eastern side of the Tigris, and it did not therefore pass through Takrit, which stood on the western bank. The distances are given by Kud\u0101ma (p. 214) and others.\n\nAl-\u1e24aditha, \u201cthe New Town,\u201d stood at the junction of the Upper, or Greater Z\u0101b, with the Tigris. The city was restored by the last Omayyad, Marwan II.; and according to Y\u0101k\u016bt (II. 222) it was in Persian times also known as Nawkird, or \u201cNew City.\u201d\n\nAs-Sinn lay on the Tigris, according to the Tanbih (p. 53), one mile below the junction of the Lower or Lesser Z\u0101b. It is, however, described by Mukaddasi (p. 123) as having the latter river on its eastern side. According to Y\u0101k\u016bt (III. 169) there were many Christian Churches here. The positions of Al-\u1e24aditha and As-Sinn are fixed respectively by the two rivers Z\u0101b, but no trace of either appears on the modern maps.\n\nAs-S\u016bda\u1e33\u0101niyya was a stage on the high road, 10 leagues south of As-Sinn, and 14 north of Samarr\u0101. Jabilt\u0101 lay five leagues south of As-S\u016bda\u1e33\u0101niyya. Both of these towns have disappeared from the map, but by the distances in Kud\u0101ma (p. 214) Jabilt\u0101 must have been situated not far from, and nearly opposite to, Takrit. The name of Jabilt\u0101 (or Jabult\u0101), from the lack of diacritical points in the MS., has often been incorrectly read \u1e24abult\u0101 (e.g. Mukaddasi p. 135, but cf. Ibn Khurd\u0101dbih p. 93, note k); the initial j is, however, very clearly pointed in the MS. of Ibn Serapion. Jabilt\u0101 is further a mint city, but the\nname on the coin-die was unfortunately likewise engraved without points. The town is not given in the Geographical Dictionaries of Y\u0101k\u016bt or Bakri, where its position in the alphabetical list would have settled the question of the initial \\( j \\) or \\( h \\); but under the form Gebh\u012bl\u0101 the place is repeatedly mentioned in the Syriac Chronicle of Thomas of Marg\u0101 (see *The Book of Governors*, E. A. W. Budge, II. 290), and this confirms the reading of Ibn Serapion.\n\nTakr\u012bt, with its strong castle, stands on the western bank of the Tigris. According to Y\u0101k\u016bt (I. 861) the town dated from Persian days, having been founded by King S\u0101b\u016br (Sapor), son of Ardash\u012br. It received its name from Takr\u012bt, daughter of W\u0101'il, ancestor of the Arab tribe of that name.\n\nSamarra, sometimes written S\u0101m\u012br\u0101, was an ancient Persian town, the name of which the Caliph Al-Mu'ta\u1e63im changed, for the sake of good augury, into Surra-man-raa, meaning \"Who sees it, rejoices.\" Samarra, during more than half a century, was made the capital of the Caliphate, dating from A.H. 221 (836), when Al-Mu'ta\u1e63im betook himself thither with his court and body-guard; and Baghd\u0101d only regained its former pre-eminence in A.H. 279 (892), on the accession of Al-Mu'ta\u1e63id. Ya\u1e33\u016bb\u012b (pp. 255\u2013268), writing about the year 278 (891), has left a long and detailed account of Samarra, and of the various palaces which adorned it. The city proper stood on the eastern bank of the Tigris, while on the western bank were many of the palaces and pleasure-grounds. The houses of the city, on the left bank, extended for a distance of seven leagues along the river, and fabulous sums, of which Y\u0101k\u016bt (III. 18) gives the details, were spent on the palaces. These all fell to ruin when the seat of government was removed back to Baghd\u0101d, and Samarra became what it had been before\u2014a provincial town; remaining, however, a place of pilgrimage to the Sh\u012b'a Muslims,\nfor here were to be seen the tombs of two of their Im\u0101ms, also the Mosque with the underground chamber, from which the promised Mahdi, Al-K\u0101'im, is to appear in the fulness of time.\n\nAl-K\u0101disiyya, also on the eastern bank of the Tigris, some three leagues below Samarr\u0101, still exists. It must not be confounded with the place of the same name, where the great battle was fought between the Arabs and the Persians, which last lay in the plain to the westward of the Euphrates, near Al-K\u016bfa. Al-K\u0101disiyya, on the Tigris, is said by Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 9) to be famous for its glass works.\n\nAl-Ajama, meaning \"the Thicket,\" is not marked on the map, and apparently is not mentioned by any other authority. Ibn Serapion later on (Section VIII.) states that it lay on or near the Nahraw\u0101n Canal.\n\nAl-\u2018Alth is still found on the map, and Mu\u1e33addasi (p. 123), who, however, writes the name without the article, speaks of it as a large town lying on a canal derived from the Tigris. Its wells of sweet water were easy of access and its men were handsome. Y\u0101k\u016bt (III. 711) notes it as the first place in Al-\u1e6cr\u0101\u1e33 on the east side of the Tigris coming from Persia. By the change of bed, however, Al-\u2018Alth now lies on the western bank of the river. From below Al-K\u0101disiyya, and down almost to Baghd\u0101d, the Tigris in the tenth century A.D. flowed by a more westerly course than it does at the present day. The old river-bed, with the ruins of \u2018Ukbar\u0101, Aw\u0101n\u0101, and Bu\u1e63r\u0101, all lying on its eastern bank, is still marked on the maps. At the present time, however, owing to the change of course, these places stand at a considerable distance from the western bank of the Tigris. That the western course was the one followed by the river in Ibn Serapion\u2019s day admits of no doubt, for the great post-road from Baghd\u0101d to Samarr\u0101, and the north, passed up the eastern\nbank of the Tigris, going through Al-Barad\u0101n and \u2018Ukbar\u0101 to Al-K\u0101disiyya; further, among other early authorities, Bil\u0101dhur\u012b (p. 249) in the ninth century A.D. couples together \u2018Ukbar\u0101 and Al-Barad\u0101n as lying to the east of the Tigris, and the two towns are so marked in the native map of the Paris MS., a work of the tenth century A.D. When the river changed over to its present western course, I have been unable exactly to ascertain. As early as the date of Mas\u2018\u016bdi, A.H. 332 (943), the bed appears to have begun to shift, for in his Meadows of Gold (I. 228) this author refers to the law-suits to which this changing of the stream had given rise, between the landowners of the eastern and western banks immediately above Baghd\u0101d. The first clear mention of \u2018Ukbar\u0101 as lying (as at the present day) to the west of the Tigris is, I believe, given by the author of the Mar\u0101sid (II. 270), who wrote about the year 1300 A.D. This author, correcting Y\u0101k\u016bt, remarks that both \u2018Ukbar\u0101 and Aw\u0101n\u0101 stood in his day at a considerable distance to the west of the Tigris, that being a consequence of the changing of the river bed, eastwards, into the course then known as Ash-Shu\u1e6day\u1e6da\u2014\u201cthe little Shatt\u201d or Stream. The exact date of this change, however, he does not give; but he adds that the Caliph Al-Mustansir, between A.H. 623 and 640 (1226\u20131242), had dug a canal to irrigate the lands which the Tigris, by its shifting, had left dry\u2014at this epoch, therefore, the change must have been complete.\n\nNeither Al-Ha\u017cira, meaning \u201cthe Enclosure,\u201d nor As-\u015eaw\u0101mi\u2019, \u201cthe Cells,\u201d have left any trace of their names on the present maps, and the latter place is not apparently mentioned by any other authority. Y\u0101k\u016bt (II. 292) states that Al-Ha\u017cira was a large village on the Dujayl Canal (see Section V.), where cotton stuffs, called Kirbd\u0101, were manufactured for export; and in another passage (II.\nhe speaks of it as lying opposite to \u1e24arb\u0101. This last place still exists on the western side of the Dujayl Canal, where there is a magnificent stone bridge, now partly in ruin, built by the last Abbasid Caliph but one, Al-Mustans\u012br, in A.H. 629 (1232). This has been drawn and described, and its dedicatory inscription copied, by Commander J. F. Jones, R.N. (Records, p. 252). In another passage Y\u0101k\u016bt (I. 178) speaks of Al-\u1e24a\u1e93ira as lying near the village of Balad, a place which like \u1e24arb\u0101 still exists.\n\nThe ruins of \u2018Ukbar\u0101, Aw\u0101n\u0101, and Bu\u1e63r\u0101, lying one close to the other, still exist on the left bank of the old bed of the Tigris, as has been already mentioned. Y\u0101k\u016bt (III. 705, I. 395, and I. 654) describes these towns as of the Dujayl District, lying some ten leagues distant from Baghd\u0101d, being very pleasant places surrounded by gardens.\n\nBaz\u016bgh\u0101, Al-Barad\u0101n, and Al-Mazrafa, all three, lay on the eastern bank of the Tigris. Al-Barad\u0101n, which gave its name to a gate and bridge in eastern Baghd\u0101d (see Section X.), Kud\u0101ma (p. 214), gives as the first stage on the north road, and it was four leagues distant from the capital. The existing ruin at Bedran doubtless represents the older name. Baz\u016bgh\u0101 has apparently disappeared entirely; according to Y\u0101k\u016bt (I. 606) it lay near Al-Mazrafa and about two leagues from Baghd\u0101d. Of Al-Mazrafa the name is apparently preserved in the district of Mazurfeh, marked on the map as immediately to the north of eastern Baghd\u0101d. According to Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 520) Al-Mazrafa was a large village lying three leagues above the city.\n\nKa\u1e6drabbul was the name of the district on the western bank of the Tigris, and up-stream, lying between Baghd\u0101d and \u2018Ukbar\u0101 (Y\u0101k\u016bt IV. 133). On the eastern bank, also up-stream, lay Ash-Shamm\u0101siyya, meaning \u201cThe Deaconry,\u201d the northernmost\nsuburb of eastern Baghd\u0101d, which gave its name to the gate opening in this direction (see Section X.). Kalw\u0101dh\u0101 was the outlying suburb on this same eastern bank, but down-stream. Kud\u0101ma (p. 193) gives it as two leagues below Baghd\u0101d and five above Al-Mad\u0101in. In the present maps its site is marked by the village of Ger\u0101ra.\n\n7 Al-Mad\u0101in, meaning \"the Cities,\" a plural form of the word Mad\u012bna, was the name by which the Arabs called the remains of the twin cities of Ctesiphon and Seleucia. Ya\u02bfk\u016bb\u012b (p. 321) at the close of the ninth century A.D. describes three towns as standing on the eastern bank among the ruins of Ctesiphon. Of these one was Al-Mad\u012bna al-\u02bfAt\u012bka, \"the Old Town\" (which also occurs as a mint city), where was to be seen \"the White Palace\" of the Chosroes, and here was the Great Mosque. One mile south of this lay the town of Asb\u0101nbur, with the great Arch of the Choeroes (still standing at the present day) and the equal of which there was none in all Persia for height, seeing that its summit was 80 ells above the ground. Adjoining these two towns lay Ar-R\u016bmiyya, built by the Greeks when they conquered Persia, and here the Caliph Al-Man\u1e63\u016br took up his abode for some months of his reign. These three cities on the eastern bank covered ground measuring two miles from end to end. The towns on the western bank (the ancient Seleucia) were Bahurasir, and a league to the south of this, S\u0101b\u0101t. Ibn Rusta (p. 186) speaks of a fire-temple as existing on this western side, which, in Sassanian days, had been endowed with the revenue of half the land-tax of F\u0101rs.\n\n8 As-S\u012bb, surnamed for distinction S\u012bb of the Bani K\u016bm\u0101, was a place noted for its olive trees (Ibn Rusta, p. 186). It was the site of the battle where, in A.H. 262 (876), Ya\u02bfk\u016bb the Saffarid was\nrouted by the troops of the Caliph Al-Mu'tamid. As-S\u012bb is not marked on the maps, but according to Kud\u0101ma (p. 193) it lay seven leagues below Al-Mad\u0101in.\n\nDayr-al-'\u0100k\u016bl, \"the Convent of the (river) Loop,\" is still marked on the map, and the name is descriptive of the Tigris course at this point. Y\u0101k\u016bt (II. 676), writing in the thirteenth century A.D., states that in his day the Convent, which originally had lain on the river bank, then stood solitary in the middle of the plain, a mile distant from the water's edge, by reason of the shifting of the Tigris bed. In former days a populous town had (he says) stood there, with good markets, but this had fallen to ruin with the decay of the District of An-Nahraw\u0101n. Ibn Rusta (p. 186), in the beginning of the tenth century A.D., alludes to the Great Mosque here, and says that across the Tigris at this point were set toll-barriers, such as will be described below (see under Haw\u0101n\u012bt, note 11), and that this was a Station for the Officials for Travellers and Customs.\n\nAs-\u1e62\u0101fiya is described by Y\u0101k\u016bt (II. 687, and III. 362) as a small town overhanging the Tigris, and of which in his day (thirteenth century A.D.) nothing but the walls and some ruins remained standing. It lay over against Dayr \u1e32unn\u0101, which last stood near Dayr-al-'\u0100k\u016bl.\n\nFor Dayr \u1e32unn\u0101 (more usually spelt Dayr \u1e32unna), otherwise called the Convent of Marmari as-Salikh, \"the Impotent,\" Y\u0101k\u016bt (II. 687) quotes the description left by Ash-Shabusht\u012b, who died A.H. 388 (998). The Convent lay sixteen leagues down stream from Baghd\u0101d, on the eastern bank, and stood at the distance of a mile from the river. Ash-Shabusht\u012b describes it as a huge monastery, surrounded by a high, solidly-built, wall, so as to be impregnable and almost like a fortress. Within\nthis wall there were a hundred cells for the monks, and the right to a cell was only to be bought for a price ranging from 200 to 1000 Din\u0101rs (\u00a3100 to \u00a3500). Surrounding each cell lay a garden, irrigated by a small canal. Every garden was planted with fruit trees, the crop of which brought in yearly a sum of from 50 to 200 Din\u0101rs (\u00a325 to \u00a3100).\n\nNeither A\u1e63-\u1e62\u0101fiya nor Dayr \u1e32unn\u0101 have apparently left any trace on the map; but judging from the description of Y\u0101k\u016bt\u2014who says that Dayr-al-\u0100\u1e33\u016bl lay fifteen leagues from Baghd\u0101d, that \u201cnear it\u201d and sixteen leagues from Baghd\u0101d lay Dayr \u1e32unn\u0101, this last standing a mile distant from the Tigris, on whose bank was A\u1e63-\u1e62\u0101fiya\u2014it seems probable that Dayr \u1e32unn\u0101 and A\u1e63-\u1e62\u0101fiya occupied a position on the eastern bank about halfway between Dayr-al-\u2018\u0100\u1e33\u016bl and Hum\u0101niya. In accordance with these data I have changed the order of names in the Arabic text, placing Dayr \u1e32unn\u0101 and Hum\u0101niya after, instead of before, Dayr-al-\u2018\u0100\u1e33\u016bl and A\u1e63-\u1e62\u0101fiya.\n\nHum\u0101niya is marked on the present maps as lying on the western Tigris bank, in a great loop of the river, about two leagues to the south-east of Dayr-al-\u2018\u0100\u1e33\u016bl. Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 980) describes it as a large village standing in the midst of cultivated lands and on the river bank. In the beginning of the ninth century A.D. it must have been a place of some importance, for after the death of the Caliph Al-Amin in Baghd\u0101d, his two sons and his mother, Zubayda, widow of H\u0101r\u016bn-ar-Rash\u012bd, were brought down the river in boats and kept prisoners at Humayniy\u0101 (as the name is otherwise spelt) before being despatched into Khur\u0101s\u0101n to Al-Mam\u016bn (see Ibn-al-Ath\u012br, VI. 207).\n\nJarjar\u0101y, more generally spelt Jarjar\u0101y\u0101, still exists. According to Ya\u1e33\u016bb\u012b (p. 321) this was the capital of the district of Lower Nahraw\u0101n; and in his day (ninth century A.D.) it was still inhabited by many\nPersian nobles. Y\u0101k\u016bt (II. 54) says that it lies on the eastern river-bank, but had become a ruin, as, in fact, had most of the other towns of the Nahraw\u0101n district.\n\nAn-Nu\u2018m\u0101niyya, Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 796) counts as the half-way stage between Baghd\u0101d and W\u0101sit. It lay four leagues down stream from Jarjar\u0101y\u0101, and five leagues above Jabbul (compare Kud\u0101ma, p. 193, with Abu-l-Fid\u0101, p. 305). By this reckoning An-Nu\u2018m\u0101niyya probably occupied the position marked Tell Na\u2018aman of Kiepert\u2019s larger map of Babylon. Ya\u2018k\u016bb\u012b (p. 321) counts An-Nu\u2018m\u0101niyya as the capital town of the district of the Upper Z\u0101b Canal, and mentions a convent here called Dayr Hizkil, where mad persons were treated. Ibn Rusta (p. 186) adds that the lands of An-Nu\u2018m\u0101niyya lay, mostly, on the western bank of the Tigris; that it was counted one of the dependent cities of Al-H\u012bra, and that the celebrated carpets of Al-H\u012bra were really made at An-Nu\u2018m\u0101niyya.\n\nJabbul is, apparently, the place now called Jambil. It lies on the eastern bank, and Ibn Rusta (p. 187) speaks of it as a large town with a great mosque, where there were bakehouses belonging to the Government. Y\u0101k\u016bt (II. 23) says that in his day (thirteenth century A.D.) the former town had sunk to the size of a large village.\n\nNahr S\u0101b\u016bs was the name of a town occupying the western bank of the Tigris and situated on the canal of the same name (see Section VI.). Ya\u2018k\u016bb\u012b describes it as lying opposite the town of Al-Mub\u0101rik, which was on the eastern bank of the Tigris. It was one day\u2019s journey above W\u0101sit, and is mentioned by Y\u0101k\u016bt (II. 903) as being the chief city of the district of the Lower Z\u0101b Canal. Nahr S\u0101b\u016bs is not marked on the present maps, but according to Kud\u0101ma (p. 194) it was situated seven leagues below Jabbul and five leagues above Fam-\u0101\u1e63-Silh.\nFam-a\u1e63-\u1e62il\u1e25 was situated seven leagues above W\u0101sit. Fam in Arabic means \"mouth,\" but applied to a canal designates what we should call the \"head\" or point of origin, where the canal branches from the parent stream\u2014not the place where it runs out to join the river again, which in English would be the usual acceptation of the term \"mouth\" as applied to a canal. Fam-a\u1e63-\u1e62il\u1e25, therefore, is \"the Head of the \u1e62il\u1e25,\" the place where that canal left the Tigris, and it was also the name of a town on the eastern river-bank. Ibn Rusta (p. 187) speaks of its Great Mosque and markets. The place also was famous in Arab history for the palace built here by \u1e24asan ibn Sahl, Waz\u012br of Al-Mam\u016bn, and in which he celebrated the espousals of his daughter B\u016br\u0101n with the Caliph his master, spending fabulous sums in banquets and gifts (cf. Mas\u02bf\u016bdi VII. 65). Y\u0101k\u016bt (III. 917), in the 13th century A.D., found the town and neighbouring villages already gone to ruin.\n\nW\u0101sit, the \"middle\" city, was so called because it lay equidistant (about 50 leagues) from Al-K\u016bfa, Al-Ba\u1e63ra, and Al-Ahw\u0101z. It was the capital of the district of Kaskar, and was founded in A.H. 84 (703) by \u1e24ajj\u0101j, the great viceroy of Al-\u2018Ir\u0101k, in the reign of the Omayyad Caliph \u2018Abd-al-M\u0101lik. The city occupied both banks of the Tigris, and the two quarters were connected by a bridge of boats. According to Ya\u02bfk\u016bb\u012b (p. 322) the eastern quarter had been a town before the days of \u1e24ajj\u0101j, and here the population was for the most part Persian. In the western quarter stood the Great Mosque, the palace of the Governors, and the celebrated Green Dome (the Khadr\u0101 of W\u0101sit), which Ibn Rusta (p. 187) states was so high that it could be seen from Fam-a\u1e63-\u1e62il\u1e25. There was also a great mosque in the eastern quarter. The lands round W\u0101sit were extremely fertile, and their crops\nprovisioned Baghd\u0101d in times of scarcity. Some idea of the richness of the W\u0101sit District may be gathered from the statement made by Ibn Hawkal (p. 162), who was here in A.H. 358 (969), when the revenue paid into the Baghd\u0101d treasury was being collected; he says that the yearly total then amounted to a million of Dirhams, about \u00a340,000.\n\nThe ruins of W\u0101sit, lying on what is now called the Shatt-al-Hay, were examined in 1831-2 by Messrs. Ormsby and Elliott (see Col. Chesney's Report of the Euphrates and Tigris Expedition, I. p. 37), but their exact position is not given. In the accompanying map, W\u0101sit is placed to agree with the distances given in Kud\u0101ma.\n\nAr-Ru\u1e63\u0101fa\u2014\"the Causeway\"\u2014surnamed for distinction Ru\u1e63\u0101fa of W\u0101sit, was a village or small town lying ten leagues below W\u0101sit, and twelve leagues above Al-Ka\u1e6dr (Kud\u0101ma, p. 194). The next place mentioned is Nahr B\u0101n, which Idrisi (A. Jauber's translation, I. 368) gives as lying half a day's journey by water below W\u0101sit, or a whole day's journey by land; it would thus have been situated but a short distance south of Ar-Ru\u1e63\u0101fa. It must be noted that neither these nor the following places on the Tigris below W\u0101sit are any of them marked on the present map.\n\nNahr B\u0101n is the name of a small town at the head of the Nahr or canal of the same name, which according to Ibn Rusta (p. 184) lay on the eastern bank of the Tigris. The name is variously spelt, Nahr B\u0101n or B\u012bn, also Nahraw\u0101n and Nahr \u0100b\u0101n, the last being the form given by Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 758), who states that it took its name from \u0100b\u0101n, a Persian woman, to whom the Chosroes had granted the land in fief. This canal is again mentioned by Ibn Serapion (Section IX.), but it must not be confounded with either the great Nahraw\u0101n (Section VIII.) or the Nahr B\u012bn of Baghd\u0101d (Section X.).\n\nAl-F\u0101r\u016bth is mentioned by Y\u0101k\u016bt (III. 840) as\na large village, with a market, lying on the bank of the Tigris in the country between W\u0101sit and Al-Madh\u0101r. It stood, therefore, on the eastern bank.\n\nOf Dayr-al-\u2018Umm\u0101l, \u201cthe Monastery of the Governors\u201d (in the singular \u2018\u0100mil), apparently no mention is made, elsewhere, sufficient to determine its position.\n\nAl-Haw\u0101n\u012bt means \u201cthe Booths,\u201d and according to Ibn Rusta (p. 184) both this place and Al-K\u0101\u1e6dr lay on the eastern bank of the Tigris. Near Al-Haw\u0101n\u012bt (at the beginning of the 10th century A.D.) toll-barriers were moored across the river, and placed under the superintendence of Government officials called Ash\u0101b as-Sayy\u0101ra wa-l-Ma\u1e63\u012br \u2014 \u201cMasters of Travellers and Barriers\u201d \u2014 such as have already been mentioned as existing up the river at Dayr-al-\u2018\u0100k\u016bl (see above, note 8). The description of these, as given in Ibn Rusta (p. 185), is as follows:\u2014\u201cThe toll-bar (called al-Ma\u1e63\u012br in Arabic) is the name given to the place on the Tigris where two boats have been moored on the one bank of the river, opposite two other boats on the further bank, which two likewise are firmly moored. Then across the stream they have carried cables, their two ends being fastened to the boats on either bank, and these prevent ships from passing by night without paying toll. Now at Al-K\u0101\u1e6dr the Tigris divides into three arms, which flow out into the Swamps.\u201d\n\nThe Swamps will be described in Section XIII.\n\n[SECTION II.]\n\nACCOUNT OF THE RIVER EUPHRATES FROM ITS SOURCE TO ITS MOUTH.\n\nThe source of the River Euphrates\\(^1\\) is at a spring in Jabal Akradkhis in longitude 60\u00b0 30\u2032 and latitude 41\u00b0 20\u2032 or 42\u00b0 20\u2032. Flowing thence, it passes by the spur of Jabal Misf\u012bn\u0101, in longitude 60\u00b0 20\u2032 and latitude 42\u00b0 25\u2032. Then\nit passes the city of Kamkh and by \u1e24i\u1e63n-al-Minsh\u0101r. Next, after flowing past Malatya, which is two miles distant from its bank, it comes to the city of Hinz\u012bt, next to the city of Sumays\u0101t, after which come Jisr Manbij and B\u0101lis. Next it flows beside the city of Ar-Rakka, which stands upon the river, and then it passes Al-Mub\u0101rik, and the head of the canal called the Nahr Sa\u02bfid. Next follow Karkisiyy\u0101, Ar-Rahba, Ad-D\u0101liya, and then it passes* [between hillocks but not] skirting the mountain, which is called Jabal-al-Kus\u016bs, from whence it passes on to \u2018Ana, and the same it surrounds, forming an island, on which stands the city. Thence it passes to Al\u016bsa and An-N\u0101wusa, coming next to the city of Hit, from whence it flows by the westward of Al-Anb\u0101r, which is a city, and here there is a bridge over the (canal of the Nahr \u2018\u012as\u0101). Thence it passes to the city of Al-K\u016bfa, which stands upon the river-bank. Now between Al-Anb\u0101r and Al-K\u016bfa there divide from the Euphrates many great canals, and these I will describe in what follows. After this the river passes on to a place in longitude 71\u00b0 5\u2032 and latitude 31\u00b0 5\u2032, and thence to longitude 78\u00b0 5\u2032 and latitude 31\u00b0 30\u2032, where it falls into the Swamp.\n\nNow when the Euphrates is in longitude 71\u00b0 5\u2032 and latitude 31\u00b0 5\u2032 aforesaid, there is a division of its waters into two streams; and from here the outermost (or eastern) stream passing onwards, flows between (the main arm of) the river Euphrates and the Saw\u0101d (or plain) of Al-K\u016bfa and of Al-Ba\u1e63ra, till finally it likewise flows out into the Swamp near by where (the main arm of) the Euphrates flows out.\n\n---\n\n1 To Ibn Serapion, the main stream of the Euphrates was the branch which is now known to the Turks as the Kara S\u016b (Black River), but which is still called Fr\u0101\u1e6d by the Arabs, and which we designate the Western Euphrates. The mountains of Jabal Akradkhis (no longer bearing this name) must be\n\n* MS. corrupt, translation tentative.\nthose near Erzeroum, where the river takes its rise. Akradkhis is not given in the Dictionaries of Y\u0101k\u016bt or Bakri. By omitting a diacritical point, Ma\u1e63\u02bf\u016bd\u012b (I. 214) writes the name Afradkhis, and in his Tunb\u012bh (p. 52) Afradkhamish, adding that the Euphrates rises in the K\u0101likal\u0101 country, of which mention will be made in a subsequent note (Section IV. note 1). Kud\u0101ma (p. 233), in the corresponding passage, gives the name of the mountains as Bar\u016bj\u012bs. It is possible that this word Akradkhis may be the Arab form of the native name, which the Roman geographers gave as Caranitis.\n\nJabal Misf\u012bn\u0101 is mentioned by Kud\u0101ma (p. 233), but by no other authority. The name is not Arab in form, and the mountain range referred to is apparently that lying to the north of Arzinj\u0101n, and called Ak D\u0101gh and Kash\u012bsh D\u0101gh at the present day.\n\nKamkh is the city on the left or south bank of the Euphrates, which the Greeks called Kamacha, and which still exists. Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 304) says that its inhabitants pronounce the name Kamakh, and that it lies one day\u2019s journey from Arzinj\u0101n. It is perhaps worth noting that in the MS. of Ibn Serapion the name is invariably written Kam\u1e25 (not with the kh).\n\n\u1e24i\u1e63n-al-Minsh\u0101r, \u201cthe Fort of the Saw,\u201d has apparently disappeared from the map. Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 661) mentions it as one of the fortresses near the Euphrates.\n\nMalatya, which the Greeks called Melitene, is still a flourishing town, and was in early days one of the most important of the Muslim fortresses of the Greek frontier. The garrison, according to Bil\u0101dhur\u012b (p. 187), held the military post at the bridge, three miles distant, over the river Kub\u0101kib (see Section III. note 5). I\u1e63\u1e6dakhr\u012b (p. 62), among others, describes Malatya as a large town, having over it\none of the strongest of the frontier fortresses, and one of the most important in the matter of both garrison and armament.\n\nHinzit, which appears to have been a place of note in early times, is difficult to identify. Ibn Serapion locates it near the Euphrates, between Malatya and Sumaysat, and in this he is confirmed by Kudama (p. 233). Ibn Serapion (see Section III.) speaks of one of the affluents of the Euphrates (unnamed) as flowing past Hinzit, and Yakut (IV. 993) counts the town as of the Greek frontiers\u2014by which a place lying to the west of the Euphrates is evidently indicated. Further, he says, that Hinzit lay near Sumnin, and in other passages the same author (III. 146, IV. 168) speaks of Sayf-ad-Dawla, the Hamdanid prince, as passing Hinzit in A.H. 335 (947), when he made his expedition against Kuluniya (query Sinis Colonia). Bakri (p. 832) counts Hinzit as of the frontier fortresses of Marash, and mentions it in connection with Malatya and Sumaysat. In another passage (p. 495) he couples it with Kharshana (see Section III. note 4).\n\nThese indications seem to point to some strong place on the present Kakhta S\u016b (possibly the ruins near the town of Kakhta), or else Hinzit may be identified with Karkar (Gerger), which is described as a magnificent Saracenic ruin occupying a commanding position (see Ritter, X. 870, 872). Both Kakhta and Karkar are mentioned by Abu-l-Fid\u0101 (p. 385) as castles situated near Malatya, but neither names, I believe, occur in the works of the earlier Arab geographers; hence the name Hinzit may have been replaced by one of these two in the later Middle Ages.\n\nSumaysat (not to be confounded with Shimsh\u0101t), below Hinzit, is the well-known town which the Greeks called Samosata. It lies north, and on the right\nbank of the Euphrates. Mas\u02bf\u016bdi (I. 215) states that its fortress was called Kal\u02bfa-at-Tin, \"the Clay Castle,\" and according to Y\u0101k\u016bt (III. 151) one of its quarters was inhabited exclusively by Armenians.\n\nJisr Manbij, B\u0101lis, and Ar-Rakka are all marked on the map. The fortress of Jisr Manbij, otherwise called Kal\u02bfa-an-Najm, \"the Castle of the Star,\" stood on a hill, according to Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 165), which overlooked the eastern bank of the Euphrates, where the high road from Manbij to Harr\u0101n crossed the river. B\u0101lis is the ancient Barbalissus, also on the western bank of the Euphrates. I\u1e63takhri (p. 62) counts it as the first Syrian town after crossing from Mesopotamia, and he says that it was the river-port of Syria on the Euphrates. Y\u0101k\u016bt (I. 477) remarks that B\u0101lis, which in former times lay on the Euphrates, in his day (13th century A.D.) stood four miles distant from the stream, by reason of the shifting of the course.\n\nAr-Rakka, on the left (northern) bank of the Euphrates immediately above where the Balikh river flows in, was counted the capital of the province of Diyar Mudar. The name Ar-Rakka, in Arabic, is applied to any plain beside a river that is at times covered by the inundation, and the word occurs in many other place-names. This Ar-Rakka occupies the approximate site of the ancient Callinicus or Nicephorium.\n\nIt is curious that Ibn Serapion should here make no mention of Ar-R\u0101s\u012bqa, the town built by the Caliph Al-Mans\u016br in A.H. 155 (772) as a place of garrison for his Khur\u0101s\u0101n troops. It lay close beside Ar-Rakka, being only 300 ells distant, and its ground-plan resembled that of Baghd\u0101d. Bil\u0101dhuri (pp. 179 and 297) relates the above particulars, and says that H\u0101r\u016bn-ar-Rash\u012bd added to the town, building many palaces, and himself lived there, preferring its climate to that of Baghd\u0101d. Y\u0101k\u016bt\n(II. 734) states that with the rise of Ar-R\u0101fi\u1e33a, Ar-Rak\u1e33a fell to ruin, so that in time the very name even of Ar-Rak\u1e33a passed to the younger city, the whole of the intervening lands having come to be built over and occupied by markets, which last took the place of a shallow lake that formerly had existed here.\n\nAl-Mub\u0101rik is a station on the high road down the right bank of the Euphrates, and is given by Kud\u0101ma (p. 217). He says it lay eight leagues below Ar-Rak\u1e33a, while the beginning of the Sa\u02bfid Canal was eight leagues above Karkis\u012bya. Nothing further is recorded of Al-Mub\u0101rik, a name common to many localities (see Section I. note 9), and meaning \u201cthe Blessing.\u201d This Al-Mub\u0101rik is omitted in Y\u0101k\u016bt.\n\nThe Nahr Sa\u02bfid, which is more particularly described in Section V., according to Bil\u0101dhuri (pp. 179 and 332), was dug by Sa\u02bfid, son of the Omayyad Caliph \u2018Abd-al-M\u0101lik, and at one time governor of Al-Maw\u1e63il. He was a man of great piety, and was surnamed Sa\u02bfid-al-Khayr, \u201cthe Good.\u201d Where the canal was dug there had been originally a thicket and swamp infested by lions; and the reclaimed lands were granted in fief to Sa\u02bfid by his brother, the Caliph Al-Wal\u012bd.\n\nKarkis\u012bya, the ancient Circesium, was a town of some importance, standing at the angle formed by the Euphrates and the inflowing river Kh\u0101b\u016br. It lay therefore on the eastern side of the Euphrates, and, according to Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 66), stood six leagues distant from Ar-Rahba.\n\nThe remains of Ar-Rahba, \u201cthe Square,\u201d are shown on the map, lying on the western bank of the Euphrates. Both this place and Ad-D\u0101liya, meaning \u201cthe Water-wheel,\u201d were surnamed for distinction Rahba, and D\u0101liya of M\u0101lik-ibn-Taw\u1e33, who Bil\u0101dhuri states (p. 180) was a man of the Taghlib tribe, and lived in the reign of Al-Mam\u016bn. From what\nY\u0101k\u016bt (II. 538, 764) says, Ar-Ra\u1e25ba and Ad-D\u0101liya must have stood very near each to the other, but the distance between the two is not given.\n\nThe range of hills called Jabal-al-Kus\u016bs\u2014a name mentioned by no other authority, and signifying \"the Hill of the Priests\"\u2014is marked on the map above \u0100na. Ritter (XI. 711) names part of the range Al-Muhadiya, and other heights appear now to be called the Sultan \u2018Abd-Allah Hills. The reading, however, of the MS. of Ibn Serapion in this passage is very uncertain, and the words which are translated \"between hillocks, but not skirting the mountain,\" are emended conjecturally.\n\n\u0100na is still marked on the map, and represents the ancient Anatho. Y\u0101k\u016bt (III. 595) speaks of it as a celebrated town, having a strong castle, that overhung the Euphrates.\n\nAl\u016bsa and An-N\u0101wusa are places frequently mentioned in the history of the Arab Conquest (cf. Bil\u0101dhuri, p. 179). Kud\u0101ma (p. 217) places Al\u016bsa seven leagues above An-N\u0101wusa, which last lay seven leagues above Hit. Al\u016bsa is marked on the map under the name of El Uz, and it appears to be identical with the place which the ancients called Olabus (Ritter, XI. 731). Y\u0101k\u016bt (I. 352, IV. 734) speaks of Al\u016bsa as a small town, and adds that An-N\u0101wusa was one of the villages of Hit.\n\nHit still exists, and, according to Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 997), was celebrated for its palm groves.\n\nAl-Anb\u0101r, \"the Granaries,\" stood above, and to the north of where the first great canal, the Nahr \u2018\u012as\u0101 (see Section V.), flowed off from the Euphrates to the Tigris (cf. Kud\u0101ma, p. 234). It was a mint city, and a town of great importance in the days of the Caliphate. In Sassanian times it was called Fir\u016bz S\u0101b\u016br (Perisabor), after King Sapor, its founder, and this name the Arabs applied to the district. The first Abbasid Caliph, As-Saff\u0101h, for a time made Al-\nAnb\u0101r his capital, and he died in the palace which he built there. Y\u0101k\u016bt (I. 367) states that the name Al-Anb\u0101r, \"the Granaries,\" was derived from the fact that of old the Persian kings stored the wheat, barley, and straw, for the rations of their troops in this town. The site of Al-Anb\u0101r appears to be that marked on the modern maps by the ruins named Sifeyra.\n\nThe ancient main-stream of the Euphrates, which flowed down to Al-K\u016bfa and then became lost in the Swamps, is called Al-\u2018Alkam\u012b by Kud\u0101ma (p. 233), and in the Tanbih (p. 52). Branching off westwards below Musayyib from what is the present main-stream, the old main-stream corresponds with the channel now known as the Nahr Hindiyya, and flowed past Al-K\u016bfa, the ruins of which lie on its western bank. The present main-stream of the Euphrates, below Musayyib, is the Nahr S\u016bra of Ibn Serapion, which will be described in Section VI.\n\nAl-K\u016bfa, the sister-city and rival of Al-Ba\u1e63ra, was founded by the Arabs at the time of the first conquest of Persia, and was intended to serve as a permanent camp on the Arab, and desert, side of the Euphrates. It occupied an extensive plain lying above the river-bank, and in its immediate vicinity was the Persian city of Al-\u1e24ira. Fronting Al-K\u016bfa was the Bridge of Boats across the Euphrates arm, over which, during the times of the Abbasid Caliphate, lay the great pilgrim road running from Baghd\u0101d southward to Mecca and Medina.\n\n[SECTION III.]\n\nAFFLUENTS OF THE EUPHRATES.\n\nAnd since now thou art free in the matter of these two great rivers (the Euphrates and Tigris), I will begin with the streams which flow into the Euphrates and the streams\nwhich are carried from the same and run into the Tigris, proceeding from its source to its mouth, stream by stream: so do thou give heed to what I shall explain to thee.\n\nOf these is a river which falls into the Euphrates, flowing down from a mountain where its source lies in longitude 62\u00b0 20', and latitude 41\u00b0 5'. It passes the city of Hinzi\u1e6d and the province thereof, falling into the Euphrates in longitude 61\u00b0 30' and latitude 39\u00b0 20'.\n\nThere also falls into the Euphrates a river called Arsan\u0101s, and this is the river of Shamsh\u0101\u1e6d. Its source is in a mountain in the limits of the country of \u1e6car\u016bn. It flows by the gate of the city of Shamsh\u0101\u1e6d, and then passes near the gate of a fortress called \u1e24i\u1e63n Ziy\u0101d, and on the banks of this river are six other fortresses. Finally it falls into the Euphrates about two marches above Malatya, and on the eastern bank.\n\nThere also falls into (the Euphrates) a river called Nahr L\u016bkiya. Its source is in Jabal Mar\u016br in the frontiers of the country of Abr\u012bk. On its bank stands a single fortress. Its point of junction with the Euphrates is at a point one day's march below the city of Kamkh, but above the mouth of the river Arsan\u0101s, and on the western bank (of the Euphrates).\n\nThere also falls into (the Euphrates) a river called Nahr Abr\u012bk. It has a mountain extending right down to its point of junction with the Euphrates, which lies a short way below the mouth of the Nahr L\u016bkiya, and likewise on the western bank (of the Euphrates).\n\nThere also flows into (the Euphrates) a river called the Nahr Anj\u0101. Its source is in the mountain of Abr\u012bk, a little way above the crossing of the high road from Malatya. It flows between mountains, and falls into the Euphrates at a distance of five leagues below the mouth of the Nahr Arsan\u0101s.\n\nThere also falls into (the Euphrates) a river called the Nahr Jarj\u0101riya. Its source is in the mountain of Jabal Mar\u016br, near the fortress of Kharshana in the Greek country. From thence it passes, traversing a long course\nthrough plains and meadows, and falls into the Euphrates, on its western bank, at a point ten leagues below the mouth of the Nahr Anj\u0101.\n\nThere also falls into (the Euphrates) a river called the Nahr Kub\u0101k\u012bb. This is a great and mighty stream, into which many lesser rivers flow, and these I will mention later. The source of the Nahr Kub\u0101k\u012bb is in the interior of the Greek country, beyond the Nahr Jayh\u0101n. Its course is between mountains, passing by fortresses, plains, and meadows, till finally it comes out into the Arab dominions, falling into the Euphrates on its western bank at a point three leagues or more below the mouth of the river Jarj\u0101riya. Here there crosses it a great bridge called Kantara Kub\u0101k\u012bb.\n\nThere falls into (the Euphrates) also a river called Nahr-al-Balikh. Its source is in the land of Harr\u0101n at a spring called \u2018Ayn-adh-Dhabb\u0101niyya. It waters many domains, hamlets, and gardens, passing by B\u0101jadd\u0101, \u1e24i\u1e63n Maslama, and B\u0101jarw\u0101n. Then, after flowing round at the back of the city of Ar-Rakka, it falls into the Euphrates on the eastern bank of the same, below Ar-Rakka, which is surnamed As-Sawd\u0101 (the Black).\n\nThere also flow into the Euphrates, at one spot, the waters of two rivers that have joined above (to form one stream). One of these is called Al-Kh\u0101b\u016br, and the other Al-Hirm\u0101s. The source of the Kh\u0101b\u016br is near the city of R\u0101s-al-\u2018Ayn at the spring called \u2018Ayn-az-Zahiriyya; the source of the Hirm\u0101s is in the land of Na\u1e63ib\u012bn at a place called T\u00fcr \u2018Abd\u012bn. Now the Hirm\u0101s is the river of Na\u1e63ib\u012bn, and in its course it waters the domains and gardens of that city; then, leaving the cultivated lands, it passes out to the plain. Here it meets the Kh\u0101b\u016br, which has watered the domains of R\u0101s-al-Ayn; and the waters of the Kh\u0101b\u016br together with those of the Hirm\u0101s form one stream, which flows on through the plain. It is the Hirm\u0101s which thus flows into the Kh\u0101b\u016br, for the chief river down to the junction of the two streams is the Kh\u0101b\u016br. Passing on, this single stream, formed by\nthe united rivers, irrigates the domains which lie to the north of Kark\u012bs\u012by\u0101, and finally flows into the Euphrates, on the eastern bank near Kark\u012bs\u012by\u0101.\n\nFrom the Hirm\u0101s, also, there flows off a river called Ath-Tharth\u0101r. Its origin is at Sukayr-al-\u2018Abb\u0101s. It passes through the midst of the plain, and runs into the Tigris below Takr\u012bt, after passing Al-Ha\u1e0dr, and cutting through the hills called Jabal B\u0101rimm\u0101.\n\nThere also flows into (the Euphrates) a river coming down from \u2018Ayn-at-Tamr. It passes through the lands of the same, and then flows on through the plain, falling into the Euphrates, on its western bank, below the city of Hit.\n\n---\n\n1 The River of Hinzi\u1e6d has been noticed above (Section II., note 2).\n\nThe Eastern Euphrates, which by some geographers is considered the main source of the great river, is given in Pliny (Nat. Hist. Bk. V. 24, Teubner\u2019s edition) as the Arsanias Flumen, and this is evidently identical with the Nahr Arsan\u0101s of Ibn Serapion. The name is apparently now entirely lost, for this stream, at the present time, is known by the Turkish name of Mur\u0101d S\u016b (or Tchay), being so called, it is said, in honour of Sultan Mur\u0101d IV., the conqueror of Baghd\u0101d, in A.D. 1638. The name Arsan\u0101s, however, is given by Y\u0101k\u016bt (I. 207), who refers to the coldness of its waters, and by Bakri (p. 91), who gives the pronunciation as Arasn\u0101s. It would appear, therefore, that this name was in use from the time of Pliny in the first century A.D. down to the 12th or 13th century A.D.\n\nThe Tar\u016bn country, where the Arsan\u0101s took its rise, is mentioned by both Kud\u0101ma (pp. 246, 251) and Bil\u0101dhur\u012b (p. 201). The name is identical with the Armenian Daron, which in earlier times occurs in Strabo as Taronites, and in Tacitus as Taurantium.\nAt the present day, however, the name Tar\u016bn has completely disappeared from the maps.\n\nThe town of Shamsh\u0101\u1e6d (or Shimsh\u0101\u1e6d) was, during the early centuries of the Hijra, a place of much importance; it is frequently mentioned in the histories of the Arab Conquest, and in the works of the earlier geographers. It has been suggested that the name represents the Arsamosata of Pliny (op. cit. Bk. VI. 9). Shamsh\u0101\u1e6d on the Arsan\u0101s has frequently been confounded with Sumays\u0101\u1e6d* on the Euphrates, a totally different town, which, as already mentioned, is the classical Samosata. Shamsh\u0101\u1e6d has completely disappeared from the maps. Its site, however, may be fixed by the indications of Ibn Serapion (see below, Section XVIII.) and Y\u0101k\u016bt (III. 319). Y\u0101k\u016bt prefaces his account by noting that this town must not be confounded with Sumays\u0101\u1e6d. He writes that, in his day, Shamsh\u0101\u1e6d was already in ruins and had but few inhabitants; adding that the city had Khartabirt (modern Kharput) to the west of it, and Bal\u016bya (modern Palu) to the east, and that it was a town of Armenia. Ibn Khurd\u0101dbih (p. 123) refers to Shamsh\u0101\u1e6d as lying close to \u1e24i\u1e63n Ziy\u0101d, which fortress Y\u0101k\u016bt (II. 276) says is identical with Khartabirt (i.e. Kharput). The ruins of Shamsh\u0101\u1e6d are to be sought for on the right or northern bank of the Mur\u0101d S\u016b, one mile above where the Nahr-as-Salk\u012b\u1e6d (see Section IV.), the modern Peri Tchay, flows in, and they must lie somewhere near the village marked Pistik on Kiepert\u2019s map.\n\nThe river Lukiya, flowing into the Euphrates one day\u2019s march below Kamkh, corresponds fairly with the modern Tchalta Irmak. The name Lukiya is not found on our maps, neither is it mentioned by any other Arab geographer. The name is evidently not Arabic, and it is remarkable that Pliny (op. cit. Bk.\n\n* E.g., Ritter X. 931; and in many places of Jaubert\u2019s translation of Idrisi, e.g., II. 129, 137, 314.\nV. 24) names a river *Lycus* as one of the affluents of the Euphrates. Possibly this is the same stream, which in the 10th century A.D. still preserved the name under which it was known in classical times.\n\n3 The Nahr Abrik is the river now called Sari-tchitchek S\u016b; and the Nahr Anj\u0101 corresponds with the stream at the mouth of which is the village of Tchermik as marked on Kiepert's map. The Castle of Abrik (see Section IV.) is the fortress which the Byzantines called *Tephrike*, corresponding to the modern Divrigi; it is mentioned in the *Tanbih* (p. 183), and by Y\u0101k\u016bt (I. 87), who quotes a curious description of the place, which is said to have been a sanctuary venerated both by the Christians and the Moslems. He spells the name Al-Abr\u016bk.\n\n4 The Nahr Jarjariya is the river now called Kuru Tchay. The fortress of Kharshana is mentioned by Y\u0101k\u016bt (II. 423) as situated at no great distance from Malatya, in the Greek country, but no trace of it is to be found on the present maps. Kharshana is the place so frequently mentioned in the Byzantine Chronicles under the name of *Kharsianon Kastron*.\n\n5 The Nahr Kub\u0101kib, which is described by both Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 26) and Bakri (pp. 657 and 726), is the river of Malatya, and except for the Arsan\u0101s is by far the most important affluent of the Upper Euphrates. The Greeks called it the river *Melas*, and its present Turkish name is the Tokhma S\u016b. The Jayh\u0101n, beyond which the Kub\u0101kib takes its rise, is the ancient *Pyramus*, which flows out into the Mediterranean in the Bay of Alexandretta. Kub\u0101kib may mean \"babbling\" in Arabic, or as the plural of *Kabkab* is the name given to the \"wooden-clogs\" worn in the bath; in either case the word is evidently onomatopoeic.\n\n6 The river Al-Balikh is the *Bilecha* of the Greek geographers; while Harr\u0101n represents the ancient *Carrhae*. Y\u0101k\u016bt (II. 231) counts Harr\u0101n as the\ncapital of the district of Diyar Mudar. According to tradition, this was the first city built after the Flood, and was the original home of the Sabeans, also called the Harranians.\n\nThe spring at the source of the Balikh, Yakut (I. 734) names the 'Ayn-adh-Dhabbaniyya, which name Ibn Rusta (p. 90) writes Ad-Dahmana, and Ibn Khurdadbih (p. 175, but cf. note k for other readings) Adh-Dhabbana. Of the three places lying on this river, Hisn Maslama took its name from Maslama, son of the Omayyad Caliph 'Abd-al-Malik. Yakut (I. 734, II. 278) writes that this fortress stood five miles from the source of the Balikh, nine leagues from Harran on the road to Ar-Rakka, and about a mile-and-a-half from the actual river-bank. From this latter point a canal brought water to the fortress, in which Maslama had dug a cistern, 200 ells square by 20 ells deep, lined with stone, in order to supply the wants of the garrison. This cistern needed only to be filled once a year, and at other times the canal served to irrigate the lands round Hisn Maslama. The fortress itself covered an area of a Jarib (an Arab land-measure equivalent to about a third of an acre, it being a plot of land measuring 60 ells by the like), and the walls of the fortress were of fifty ells in height.\n\nBajadda is described by Yakut (I. 453) as a large village lying near Hisn Maslama, and between Ras-al-'Ayn and Ar-Rakka. Maslama had granted this land in fief to one of his captains, named Asid, of the Sulaym tribe, who surrounded the place with a wall and built the village. Springs abounded here, and the gardens were celebrated.\n\nBajarwan, Yakut (I. 454) mentions as a village of Diyar Mudar, on the Balikh. According to Kudama (p. 215) Bajarwan lay three leagues northward of Ar-Rakka on the high road to Harran,\nwhich last was eleven leagues from B\u0101jarw\u0101n, while from B\u0101jarw\u0101n it was seven leagues to \u1e24i\u1e63n Maslama on the road to R\u0101s-al-\u2018Ayn in a northeasterly direction. (For Ar-Rakka, see above, Section II. note 4.)\n\nThe Kh\u0101b\u016br is the river which the Greeks called Chaboras. The origin of the name Hirm\u0101s appears to be unknown. The Greek geographers called this river either Saocoras or Mygdonius. The Kh\u0101b\u016br has kept its name to the present time, but the river of Nas\u012bb\u012bn, the Hirm\u0101s, is now generally known as the Jaghjagha.\n\nThe town of R\u0101s-al-\u2018Ayn, meaning in Arabic the \u201cSpring-head,\u201d bore this name long before Arab days, being mentioned in Resaina by the Latin geographers. The place was noted for its numerous springs, and their waters made the surrounding country a garden. The \u2018Ayn-az-Z\u0101hiriyya, by Y\u0101k\u016bt\u2019s account (II. 731, 911), was fathomless, and the stream flowing from it was in old times sufficiently deep to carry small pleasure-boats, in which people went from garden to garden, and down to Karkisiya. In the 13th century A.D., however, the Hirm\u0101s was no longer navigable.\n\nNa\u1e63\u012bb\u012bn is the Roman Nisibis, which Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 787) says was celebrated for its white roses and its forty thousand gardens. It was counted the capital of the district of Diyar Rabi\u2019a, and is still a flourishing town.\n\nT\u00fcr \u2018Abdin, \u201cthe Mountain of (God\u2019s) Servants,\u201d is the hilly district still bearing this name, which is so celebrated in the annals of the Jacobite Christians. According to Muslim tradition (see Y\u0101k\u016bt III. 559) Jabal J\u016bd\u012b, a mountain of this district, was the place where the Ark of Noah came to rest, as related in the Kur\u0101n, chapter XI. verse 46. (For Karkisiya see above, Section II. note 5.)\n\nThe account of the river Ath-Tharth\u0101r is repeated below\nin Section VII. At the present day its stream is so shrunk in volume that it no longer forms a natural water-way between the Euphrates and the Tigris. According to Ibn Serapion, it flowed out from the Hirm\u0101s at Sukayr (the \"little Dam\" of) al-\u2018Abb\u0101s. Y\u0101k\u016bt (III. 109), however, describes this place as a small town on the Kh\u0101b\u016br, where there is a mosque. Further, both Kud\u0101ma (p. 216) and Ibn Khurd\u0101dbih (p. 96) likewise place Sukayr on the Kh\u0101b\u016br, and give it as lying on the high road, fourteen leagues from Sinj\u0101r, and eighteen leagues from \u1e32ark\u012bsiy\u0101. These distances (especially the latter) are difficult to fit in with what is shown on the present map. The Tharth\u0101r river must have cut through the Sinj\u0101r mountains (the Jabal B\u0101rimm\u0101) at the gap to the west of the town of that name; but possibly the point of junction of the Kh\u0101b\u016br and Hirm\u0101s was not in the tenth century A.D. where it now is. Y\u0101k\u016bt (I. 921) describes the bed of the Tharth\u0101r, in his day (13th century A.D.), as running in flood when the rains were plenteous, but in summer as showing only pools of warm water, with here and there brackish springs. He had himself travelled along its course, and adds that of old, as it was reported, boats could pass up its stream, and that many villages lay along its banks in the midst of well-cultivated lands.\n\nAl-Hadr is the ancient Hatra, still standing, with the ruins of a Parthian palace. Y\u0101k\u016bt calls it the city of a certain As-S\u0101\u1e6dir\u016bn, adding (II. 281) that it is built of squared stones, which form chambers, with their roofs and doors likewise of stone. There were originally sixty towers, with three turrets in between each tower, and a castle stood over against each.\n\nJabal B\u0101rimm\u0101, Y\u0101k\u016bt says (I. 464), is also known as Jabal \u1e24umrin, and this is the chain of hills which stretches across Upper Mesopotamia from west to east,\ntill it reaches the mountains of Persia. Through this chain the Tigris cuts its way at As-Sinn. The hill-chain here spoken of is evidently that at present called Jabal Sinj\u0101r, from the town of Sinj\u0101r, which also gave its name to the plain referred to by Ibn Serapion (Section VII.). Sinj\u0101r city still exists, and Y\u0101k\u016bt (III. 158) describes it as a fine town with magnificent gardens that were celebrated for their crops of dates, oranges, and lemons. It was from this city that the famous Saljuk Sultan, Sinj\u0101r, took his name, it having been his birth-place.\n\nThe town of \u2018Ayn-at-Tamr, meaning \u201cthe Date Spring,\u201d was a place of importance in the days of the first Muslim conquest, but its site is apparently lost. Y\u0101k\u016bt (III. 759) says that it lay near Al-Anb\u0101r, and to the west of Al-K\u016bfa on the borders of the Arabian desert, but unfortunately no authority gives its distance from either of these towns. Further, near \u2018Ayn-at-Tamr was a place called Shafatha, and from both towns great quantities of sugar-cane and dates were exported to neighbouring lands. Kud\u0101ma (p. 236) counts \u2018Ayn-at-Tamr as one of the six sub-districts of the Ast\u0101n, or District, of Upper Bihkub\u0101dh, coupling it with B\u0101bil (Babylon) and other neighbouring territories. The stream on which it stood is apparently either the present W\u0101d\u012b-al-\u2018Am\u012bh of Kiepert\u2019s map, or the W\u0101d\u012b Burd\u0101n. The town of Shafatha referred to by Y\u0101k\u016bt may be the place marked under the name of Shethatheh on the above-mentioned map;\n\n[SECTION IV.]\n\nSTREAMS FLOWING INTO AFFLUENTS OF EUPHRATES.\n\nAnd now regarding the streams which are the affluents of these rivers flowing into the Euphrates, they too are great rivers, and among them are the following:\u2014\nInto the Nahr Arsan\u0101s flows a river called the Nahr-adh-Dh\u012bb\u00b9 (the \"Wolf River\"). Its source is in a mountain in the neighbourhood of K\u0101likal\u0101. It turns and passes many fortresses, falling into the river Arsan\u0101s a short distance above the city of Shamsh\u0101\u1e6d.\n\nThere also flows into the Arsan\u0101s a river called As-Salk\u012b\u1e6d. Its source is in the mountains called Jabal Mar\u016br (or Maz\u016br). It turns passing many fortresses, and falls into the Arsan\u0101s a little below the city of Shamsh\u0101\u1e6d and the mountain near it.\n\nInto the river Abr\u012b\u1e33 flows a river called Zamra.\u00b2 Its source is in the mountain called Jabal Mar\u016br, a little above the source of the river L\u016bk\u012bya, and it falls into the river Abr\u012b\u1e33 a little below the Castle (of Abr\u012b\u1e33).\n\nInto the river Jarj\u0101riya flows a river called the Nahr Ghawth.\u00b3 Its source is in a mountain in the neighbourhood of Abr\u012b\u1e33, and it falls in the Nahr Jarj\u0101riya.\n\nInto the river Kub\u0101\u1e33ib falls a river called Kar\u0101\u1e33\u012bs.\u2074 Its source is in a lake in the Greek country. It passes near the gate of Zib\u0101\u1e6dra, and it falls into the Kub\u0101\u1e33ib.\n\nThere also falls into the Kub\u0101\u1e33ib the river called Nahr-ar-Zarb\u016b\u1e33 (or Zarn\u016b\u1e33). Its source is in a mountain lying between Malatya and \u1e24i\u1e63n Man\u1e63\u016br. It falls into the Kub\u0101\u1e33ib below the mouth of the river Kar\u0101\u1e33\u012bs.\n\nFrom the river Az-Zarn\u016b\u1e33 there is carried a stream called the Nahr Malatya; it waters various domains, and falls into the Kub\u0101\u1e33ib below (the mouth of) the river Az-Zarn\u016b\u1e33. From this stream are brought the water-courses of Malatya, which, entering the city, afterwards pass forth and fall into the Kub\u0101\u1e33ib below the Bridge.\n\nThere also falls into the Kub\u0101\u1e33ib a river called J\u016br\u012bth (or \u1e24\u016br\u012bth).\u2075 Its source is at (the Spring of) \u2018Ayn Zan\u012bth\u0101; its course lies through certain lakes, and it passes near the city of Al-\u1e24adath, falling out into the Kub\u0101\u1e33ib at a point in the direction of this town.\n\nInto the J\u016br\u012bth (or \u1e24\u016br\u012bth) there falls a river called Al-\u2018Arj\u0101n. Its source is in the mountains of Jabal-ar-Rish, and it flows into the J\u016br\u012bth (or \u1e24\u016br\u012bth). From the river\nAl-'Arj\u0101n are brought the water-courses of Al-Hadath, and their waters flow back into the same.\n\n1 It will be seen that Ibn Serapion has given this section, describing the tributaries of the affluents of the Euphrates, in duplicate (see below, Section XVIII.); but since some additional information is to be found in the second account, it has seemed worth while to print the texts and the translations in full.\n\nThe two tributaries of the Arsan\u0101s serve to fix the site of Shamsh\u0101t, as already stated (see Section III. note 1). Nahr-adh-Dhib, the \"Wolf River,\" is a common name for streams, and there is an affluent of the Tigris which is likewise so-called (see below, Section VII.). This Nahr-adh-Dhib is evidently the stream now known as the Gunek Su. K\u0101likal\u0101, where it is said to rise, according to the somewhat vague statement of Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 19), was the name by which the Arabs called the chain of mountains in Greater, or Fourth, Armenia, and it was of the province of Min\u0101zjird (modern Melasgird) or of Khil\u0101t (Akhl\u0101t). Further, Ibn Serapion (MS. folio 46b) says that the river Ar-Rass (the Araxes) \"has its source in the mountain between Khil\u0101t and K\u0101likal\u0101, being from the K\u0101likal\u0101 district.\" Ibn Rusta (p. 89) and Ibn Khurd\u0101dbih (p. 174) both confirm this, and the latter authority gives K\u0101likal\u0101, also, as the country of the head-waters of the (western) Euphrates. The name has entirely disappeared from the maps, but from the above K\u0101likal\u0101 evidently represents the mountainous district lying between the various sources of the Eastern and Western Euphrates and those of the Araxes.\n\nThe river Salk\u0101t (or As-Salk\u012bt), which (see Section XVIII.) joined the Arsan\u0101s \"one mile below Shamsh\u0101t,\" is the stream now called Peri Tchay, with its numerous tributaries. The statement that this\nstream rises in the Jabal Mar\u016br is puzzling. By our author's account, repeated more than once, these mountains were in the Abrik Country, that is to the westward of the Euphrates, while the present passage evidently refers to the district lying eastward of the great river, and between the two great arms of the Eastern and Western Euphrates. The name Mar\u016br, to my knowledge, occurs in no other author, and I am inclined to think that the MS. in this and the corresponding passage (Section XVIII.) may be in error, for by the addition of a diacritical point Mar\u016br becomes Mas\u016br, and this, written Mezour D\u0101gh, is the mountain which, at the present day, gives its name to a tributary stream of the upper waters of the Peri Tchay. Jabal Mar\u016br may mean \"the Mountain of the Passage,\" while Maz\u016br is a name applied to any place \"visited\" by pilgrims.\n\n3 The tributary of the Abr\u0131k, called Zamra, is probably the modern Miram Tchay, which flows into the Sari Tchitchek S\u016b, a little below Divrigi, \"the Castle of Abr\u0131k,\" mentioned in the text and referred to in Section III. note 3. A place called Zimarra is marked on Kiepert's map at this spot.\n\n4 The Nahr Ghawth must be the tributary stream shown on the map as flowing from the northward past the village of Mirlabey into the Kuru Tchay, the Jarj\u0101-riya of our author.\n\n5 The tributaries of the \u1e32ub\u0101\u1e33ib (the ancient Melas and the present Tokma Su) are of importance, since they give us the sites of two places of much note in early days, namely, Ziba\u1e6dra and Al-\u1e24adath. The Nahr Kar\u0101\u1e33is, on which stood Ziba\u1e6dra, is evidently the present Sult\u0101n Su, and Ziba\u1e6dra itself I feel inclined to identify with the remains now called Vir\u0101n Shahr, \"the Ruined City\" (see Ritter, X. 850). Ziba\u1e6dra was a frontier fortress of great importance in medi\u00e6val times. According to Bil\u0101dhuri (p. 191) it was an\nancient Greek fortress: possibly it may be identical with Sosopetra, which is, I believe, mentioned in the Byzantine Chronicles. Bil\u0101dhuri tells us that it was conquered at the same time as Al-\u1e24adath (see below, note 5), that it was rebuilt by the Caliph Al-Man\u1e63\u016br, after having been destroyed during an incursion of the Greeks; later on it was strongly fortified by Al-Mam\u016bn, and since that date had been dismantled and refortified several times over. Abul-Fid\u0101 (p. 234), who had visited Zibatra in A.H. 715 (1315), describes it as a ruin, of which only the line of the walls remained:\u2014\"Its fields are all wasted; it lies in a plain surrounded by mountains, and the vegetation grows close up to its walls. It stands two marches southward of Malatya, and the same distance westward of \u1e24i\u1e63n Man\u1e63\u016br.\" Kud\u0101ma (p. 97) states that from Malatya to Zibatra was five leagues, and thence on to Al-\u1e24adath it was four leagues.\n\nThe river that flows by Malatya (see also Section XVIII.) is called Nahr-az-Zarn\u016bk or Az-Zarb\u016bk by Ibn Serapion, for both these readings are given in the MS., and I have been unable to find the name in any other authority. This stream, whose waters irrigated the plain round the city (see Ritter, X. 851) is now known as the Shakma S\u016b.\n\n\u1e24i\u1e63n Man\u1e63\u016br, now more often called Adiam\u0101n, lies immediately to the north of Sumays\u0101\u1e6d. According to Bil\u0101dhuri (p. 192) this fortress took its name from a certain Man\u1e63\u016br ibn Ja\u02bfwana, who commanded some troops here, and rebuilt the fortifications in the days of Marw\u0101n II., the last Omayyad Caliph. H\u0101r\u016bn-ar-Rash\u012bd restored the buildings, and Istakhri (p. 62) describes it as a small fortified town with a Friday Moeque.\n\nThe site of Al-\u1e24adath and the streams on which it lay, are difficult to identify. Al-\u1e24adath was conquered by the Muslims in the reign of \u2018Omar; and Bil\u0101dhuri (p. 189) states that the name was originally Darb-al-\nHadath-as-Sal\u0101ma, that is \"the Road of the News of Safety.\" This, in course of time, was shortened to Al-Hadath, meaning \"the News\" (of Safety), and held as of good augury. The town was rebuilt by the Caliph Al-Mahdi, and again later by Ar-Rashid, when its garrison was fixed at 2,000 men. Istakhri (p. 62) mentions its arable fields and excellent fruit-trees, and relates how this frontier-fortress was taken and re-taken alternately by the Greeks and Muslims. Y\u0101k\u016bt (II. 218) speaks of the town, with its strong castle, as lying between Malatya, Sumays\u0101t, and Mar'ash. It was surnamed Al-Hamr\u0101, \"the Red,\" and its Castle crowned a hill called Al-Uhaydab. Dimashki (pp. 208, 214) says that Al-Hadath, on being rebuilt by Al-Mahdi, took the name of Al-Mu\u1e25ammadiyya, after that Caliph, being called by the Armenians Kaytuk. Abu-l-Fid\u0101 (p. 263) states that this Castle stood twelve miles distant from a point on the river Jayh\u0101n (the Pyramus), where this stream was crossed at \"the Ford of the Alide.\" Ibn Khurd\u0101dbih (p. 97) writes that between Al-Hadath and Mar'ash was a distance of thirty miles, but Kud\u0101ma (p. 216) gives it as five leagues, or about fifteen miles.\n\nTurning now to the rivers of Al-Hadath, the name of the Nahr J\u016br\u012bth is very clearly so written by Ibn Serapion, i.e. with an initial j. Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 838), however, gives the name as \u1e24\u016brith, placing it among the \u1e24s in his alphabetical list, and, as usual, specifying the exact pronunciation. He goes on to state that the river \u1e24\u016brith \"flows out of the Lake of Al-Hadath, near Mar'ash,\" but adds (and I believe in error) that \"flowing on, it finally falls into the Nahr Jayh\u016bn,\" the Pyramus, which runs to the Mediterranean. The spring of \u2018Ayn Zan\u012bth\u0101 and the tributary Nahr-al-\u2018Arj\u0101n, flowing down from the mountains of Jabal-ar-Rish, are none of them, to my knowledge, mentioned by any other authority. On an examination of the map,\nthe only tributary of the Tokhma S\u016b, which at all satisfies the requirements of the case, is the Gurun S\u016b (see Ritter, X. 841), on which lies Gurun, an important town, in Byzantine days called Gauraina, at or near which I am inclined to place Al-Hadath. The Gurun S\u016b I conclude to be the medi\u00e6val J\u016brith or \u1e24\u016brith, and the \u2018Arj\u0101n would be one of its tributaries, possibly that now called the Inja S\u016b.\n\n[SECTION V.]\n\nACCOUNT OF THE CANALS WHICH ARE BROUGHT FROM (THE EUPHRATES OR TIGRIS), AND WHICH FLOW BACK INTO (THE SAME OR OTHER RIVER).*\n\nFrom the Euphrates is taken (the canal called) the Nahr Sa\u02bfid.\u00b9 Its origin is just below the Dome (Al-\u1e32ubba), which is called Fam (or Mouth of the) Nahr Sa\u02bfid. It flows watering the domains which lie to the west of the Euphrates, and, passing on, next irrigates the domains of Ar-Ra\u1e25ba, and then falls into the Euphrates on the western bank, and above D\u0101liya of M\u0101lik ibn Tawk, after various canals have branched from it, which water the domains of D\u0101liya aforesaid.\n\nFrom the Tigris is taken a canal called Dujayl.\u00b2 Its beginning is a league or more above the village of Ar-Rabb. Then it passes cross-wise, and from it branch many canals which water the domains of Maskin and Ka\u1e6drabbul, and the hamlets pertaining thereto, and finally it falls into the Tigris between \u2018Ukbar\u0101 and Baghd\u0101d.\n\nFrom the Euphrates is taken a canal called the Nahr \u2018\u012as\u0101.\u00b3 Its beginning is in longitude 68\u00b0 50\u2032 and latitude 32\u00b0 20\u2032. At its head is a wonderful bridge, called Kan\u1e6dara Dimimm\u0101, Dimimm\u0101 being the name of a village lying on the\n\n* The Arabic is ambiguous, but this, from what follows, is evidently the sense.\nEuphrates and on the canal. The canal passes on, with running waters, and irrigates the districts of Fir\u00fbz S\u00e2b\u00fbr, flowing by villages and domains which lie on both its banks. When it reaches Al-Mu\u1e25awwal the canals of the City of Peace (Baghd\u00e2d) branch from it, but these we will detail later. From Al-Mu\u1e25awwal it passes to Al-Y\u0101siriyya, and here there crosses it the bridge called Kan\u1e6dara-al-Y\u0101siriyya. Thence it passes through the midst of (the district of) B\u0101d\u016bray\u0101, which lies (mostly) to the eastward of it. Thence it passes to Ar-R\u016bmiyya, and there is here a bridge over it called Kan\u1e6dara-ar-R\u016bmiyya. Thence it passes to (the Place of the Oil-sellers, called) Az-Zayy\u0101\u1e6din [and here there is a bridge over it called by the same name] *; and thence to the Place of the Sellers of Alkali (Ushn\u0101n), where over it is a bridge called Kan\u1e6dara-al-Ushn\u0101n. Thence it passes to the Place of the Sellers of Thorns (Shawk), where over it is a bridge called the Kan\u1e6dara-ash-Shawk; from thence to the Place of the Sellers of Pomegranates (Rumm\u0101n), where over it is a bridge called the Kan\u1e6dara-ar-Rumm\u0101n. Thence it goes to (the bridge called) Kan\u1e6dara-al-Maghid, and (the place called) Al-Maghid. Then it passes to Kan\u1e6dara-al-Bust\u0101n (the Garden Bridge); then to (the bridge called) Kan\u1e6dara-al-Ma'badi; next to (another called) Kan\u1e6dara Bani Zurayk, and finally falls into the Tigris on its western bank, below (the palace called) Ka\u1e63r '\u012as\u0101-ibn-M\u016bs\u0101, of the City of Peace (Baghd\u0101d).\n\nFrom the Euphrates also is taken the canal called the Nahr Sar\u1e63ar. Its origin is three leagues below the village of Dimimm\u0101. It is a great canal, with running waters, and the lands (adjacent) are irrigated from it by means of the (water-wheel called) D\u0101liya and the (lever called) Shad\u016bf. Over it is a Bridge-of-Boats (Jisr), and there are domains and villages (on its banks). It passes through part of (the District of) B\u0101d\u016bray\u0101, and finally flows into the Tigris, on its western bank, between Baghd\u0101d and Al-Mad\u0101in, and at a point four leagues above Al-Mad\u0101in.\n\n* Supplied from Y\u0101\u1e33\u016bt, IV. 842.\nFrom the Euphrates also is taken a canal called the Nahr-al-M\u0101lik.\\(^5\\) Its point of origin is five leagues below the head of the Nahr \u0160arqar. It is a canal that has along it numerous domains and fertile lands. There is also a Bridge-of-Boats over it; and further many villages and fields (along its banks). From it branch numerous other canals, and its lands form a District of the Saw\u0101d. Finally it flows out into the Tigris on its western bank, three leagues below Al-Mad\u0101in.\n\nFrom the Euphrates also is taken a canal called the Nahr K\u016bth\u0101.\\(^6\\) Its point of origin is three leagues below that of the Nahr-al-M\u0101lik. It is a canal watering numerous domains and villages. There is a Bridge-of-Boats over it, and from it branch other canals, irrigating the District of K\u016bth\u0101\u2014which is of the province of Ardash\u012br B\u0101bak\u0101n\u2014also part of the District of Nahr Jawbar. After passing by K\u016bth\u0101 Rabb\u0101, it finally flows out into the Tigris on its western bank, ten leagues below Al-Mad\u0101in.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The canal of Sa\u02bfid has been described in Section II. note 4.\n\nThe word D\u0101liya, in Arabic, besides meaning \u201ca grape-vine,\u201d or \u201cbunch of grapes,\u201d is also the name for \u201ca water-wheel,\u201d being the synonym of N\u0101\u02bf\u016bra. This last is the more common term for these instruments of irrigation, and under the plural form of An-Naw\u0101\u02bfir this occurs as a place-name (see Section VI.)\n\n\\(^2\\) The Dujayl, or \u201cLittle Tigris,\u201d is the name given to the canal above Baghd\u0101d, on the right or western bank of the Tigris, whose waters irrigate the district called Maskin, which lies immediately to the north of the Katrabbul district. The village of Ar-Rabb is not, I believe, mentioned by any other geographer. According to Y\u0101k\u016bt (II. 555) the Dujayl Canal begins opposite Al-K\u0101disiyya. Its course may still be traced on the modern maps.\nThe Nahr '\u012as\u0101 is the first of the four great canals which carry the surplus waters of the Euphrates into the Tigris, and irrigate the intervening lands, called the Saw\u0101d (or \"black\" alluvial plain) of lower Mesopotamia. The Nahr '\u012as\u0101 left the Euphrates immediately below Al-Anb\u0101r, and so much of its waters as was not diverted by the \u1e62ar\u0101t\u2014and the other minor canals, which branched from its left bank\u2014flowed out at last into the Tigris some distance below Baghd\u0101d at a place known as Al-Fa\u1e0dla, \"the Harbour\" (see Ya\u1e33\u016b\u1e6d\u012b, p. 250). In general the Nahr '\u012as\u0101 followed the line of the modern Saklawiyya Canal. Dimimm\u0101 is described by Ya\u1e33\u016b\u1e6d (II. 600) as a large village on the Euphrates near the hamlet of Al-Fall\u016bja; and these two villages with Al-Anb\u0101r were the chief places of the district of Fir\u016bz S\u0101b\u016br, the Perisabor of the Greek geographers (see Section II. note 7). The whole of this section of Ibn Serapion has been copied almost verbatim by Ya\u1e33\u016b\u1e6d (IV. 842).\n\nAl-Mu\u1e25awwal, meaning the \"Place of Unloading,\" is described by Ya\u1e33\u016b\u1e6d (IV. 432) as a fine township, one league distant from Baghd\u0101d, and celebrated for its gardens and markets. The name Al-Mu\u1e25awwal is explained by the account in Ibn Hawkal (p. 166), who says that ships could float unimpeded down the Nahr '\u012as\u0101 from the Euphrates to the Tigris, but that, by reason of the bridges and weirs, their cargoes had to be \"unloaded\" into small boats in order to pass into the \u1e62ar\u0101t, the canal (see Section XI.) which branched from the Nahr '\u012as\u0101, immediately below Al-Mu\u1e25awwal, and flowed into Baghd\u0101d.\n\nThe District of B\u0101d\u016bray\u0101 is described by Ya\u1e33\u016b\u1e6d (I. 460) as comprising the lands lying to the westward of Baghd\u0101d. It is divided, he says, from the Ka\u1e6drabbul District by the Canal of the \u1e62ar\u0101t, the lands to the west (and north) of this being\nKatrabbul, while Bad\u016bray\u0101 is to the east (and south) of this canal.\n\nIn regard to the various bridges over the Nahr \u2018\u012as\u0101, Y\u0101k\u016bt gives particulars of the following. The Y\u0101sir\u012byya (IV. 1002) was called after a man named Y\u0101sir, and the village of this name lay about one mile from Al-Muhawwal, and two miles from Baghd\u0101d, on the canal bank. It was famous for its gardens. Ibn Hawkal (p. 165) mentions the gate called B\u0101b-al-Y\u0101sir\u012byya as marking the westernmost limit of Baghd\u0101d, adding that formerly five miles of streets intervened between this point and the Khur\u0101s\u0101n Gate to the north-east, which lay at the boundary of the Eastern quarter of the city, on the Persian side of the Tigris (see Section XI. note 1). Ushn\u0101n, Y\u0101k\u016bt (I. 284) says, is the substance (alkali) used for washing clothes, and he adds that the bridge of this name was a well-known quarter of Western Baghd\u0101d. The bridge of Ash-Shawk is noticed in like terms (IV. 191). Here dwelt the clothes-merchants (Al-Bazz\u0101z\u016bn) and other hucksters. Kan\u1e6dara-al-Magh\u012bd means the Bridge of \u201cthe Place which lacks-water,\u201d but is not otherwise specified. Kan\u1e6dara-al-Ma\u2019b\u0101di, Y\u0101k\u016bt says (IV. 191), was called after a certain \u2018Abd-Allah ibn Mu\u1e25ammad Al-Ma\u2019b\u0101di, who possessed fiefs here, and built this bridge, with a mill and a palace (D\u0101r) which were all called after him. These buildings afterwards came into the possession of Mu\u1e25ammad Az-Zayy\u0101t (the Oil-man), who was Wasir of the Caliph Al-W\u0101thik. The Bridge of the Bani Zuray\u1e33 is described (IV. 190) as having been built of marble. The family of Zuray\u1e33 were celebrated architects, and of Persian origin.\n\nThe great Nahr \u2018\u012as\u0101 was named after an \u2018Abb\u0101sid\nPrince whom Ibn Serapion calls Ibn (son of) M\u016bs\u0101, but whom all other authorities call Ibn \u2018Al\u012b. This canal was, however, far more ancient than Arab times, and its upper portion, according to Kud\u0101ma (p. 234), was originally called Ad-Dakil, while its lower reach was apparently known as the Nahr Rufayl (compare Y\u0101k\u016bt, IV. p. 839, with pp. 117 and 190 of the same volume). In regard to the Prince \u2018\u012as\u0101, who re-dug this canal, and whose palace stood just above its point of junction with the Tigris, if he be called \u2018\u012as\u0101-ibn-M\u016bs\u0101 (as in the text of Ibn Serapion), he was nephew to the Caliph Al-Man\u1e63\u016br, founder of Baghd\u0101d, who at one time appointed him to be his successor in the Caliphate. This \u2018\u012as\u0101 was governor of Al-Ahw\u0101z and Al-K\u016bfa, at which latter city he died, after having been ousted from his right to the succession by Al-Man\u1e63\u016br, who proclaimed his own son, Al-Mahdi, heir-apparent in his stead. It seems likely, however, that Ibn Serapion has here made a mistake, and that it was \u2018\u012as\u0101, son of \u2018Al\u012b, and uncle of the Caliph Al-Man\u1e63\u016br, who (as all other authorities concur in stating) was the person from whom the Nahr \u2018\u012as\u0101 took its name. Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 117) says that his palace (Ka\u1e63r) was the first of those built by the \u2018Abbasids, during the reign of Al-Man\u1e63\u016br, after Baghd\u0101d had been founded; and though no traces of it remained in the thirteenth century A.D., a great quarter of the city, with its markets and streets, was still known as the Ka\u1e63r \u2018\u012as\u0101. Apparently this palace had changed its name in A.H. 278 (891), when Ya\u1e33\u016bb\u012b wrote his description of Baghd\u0101d, for the only palaces he mentions (p. 245) at this point are those of \u2018\u012as\u0101 and Ja\u2018far, grandsons of Al-Man\u1e63\u016br, their sister, Zubayda, being the famous wife of H\u0101r\u016bn-ar-Rash\u012bd. The following table makes clear\nthe relationships of the various '\u012as\u0101s.

The Bridge-of-Boats mentioned was at the point where the great pilgrim high road, from Baghd\u0101d to Al-K\u016bfa, crossed the canal, namely, according to Ibn Rusta (p. 182) at a point ten miles south of Baghd\u0101d. Here stood the town of \u0160ar\u0161ar at no great distance from the Tigris bank, to judge from the account in: Y\u0101k\u016bt (I. 768). The water-wheels called D\u0101liya have been mentioned above (Section V. note 1); the Shad\u016bf is described by E. Lane in his Modern Egyptians (Chapter XIV.), where an illustration will be found representing it. Here, and in the following pages, the word Jisr is always translated \u201cBridge-of-Boats,\u201d while Kantara is rendered by \u201cBridge,\u201d and implies an arched structure of masonry.\n\n5 The Nahr-al-M\u0101lik, \u201cThe King\u2019s Canal,\u201d dates from very ancient times, and under the name of Naharmalcha is frequently mentioned by the classical historians. Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 846) reports that tradition assigned its digging either to Solomon or Alexander.\nRoughly speaking, it followed the line of the modern Radhw\u0101niyya Canal. The Bridge-of-Boats crossed it, on the Baghd\u0101d K\u016bfa high road, at the town, likewise called Nahr-al-M\u0101lik, and according to Ibn Rusta (p. 182) this lay seven miles distant from the \u0160ar\u0161ar bridge. The town of Nahr-al-M\u0101lik, Ibn Hawkal (p. 166) states, was larger by a half than the town of \u0160ar\u0161ar; both districts were famous for their corn-lands and date-palms.\n\nThe Nahr K\u016bth\u0101 is represented by the line of the modern \u1e24abl Ibr\u0101h\u012bm. The city of K\u016bth\u0101 dates from biblical days, for in II. Kings, xvii. 24, there is mention made of Cuthah, one of the important places near Babylon. According to Muslim tradition K\u016bth\u0101 is the place where Abraham was thrown into the fire by the tyrant Nimrod (see G. Weil, Biblische Legenden der Muselm\u00e4nner, p. 74); and Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 317) asserts that K\u016bth\u0101, who dug this canal, was the grandfather of Abraham. Ibn Hawkal (p. 168) states that K\u016bth\u0101 consisted of two cities called respectively K\u016bth\u0101-at-Tar\u012bk, \u201cof the road,\u201d and K\u016bth\u0101 Rabba, which latter was a city larger than B\u0101bil (Babylon). He adds:\u2014\u201cHere are great mounds of ashes which, they say, are those of the fire made by Nimrod, son of Canaan, into which he threw Abraham, the Friend of God.\u201d Mukaddasi (p. 121), repeating the above, adds that near the high road might be seen a building resembling a minaret (or tower) about which the people related many strange legends. The site of K\u016bth\u0101 is still marked by the mound called Tell Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, \u201cthe Hill of Abraham.\u201d The Bridge-of-Boats, mentioned by Ibn Serapion, lay on the Baghd\u0101d K\u016bfa high road, and it was four miles, according to Ibn Rusta (p. 182), below the town of Nahr-al-M\u0101lik. The point where the K\u016bth\u0101 canal joined the Tigris\n(stated to have been ten leagues below Al-Mad\u0101in) would bring it out nearly opposite Dayr-al-\u2018\u0100k\u016bl (see Section I. note 8). The canal of Nahr Jawbar is mentioned incidentally by Y\u0101k\u016bt (I. 324 and II. 141), and in Kud\u0101ma (p. 236) Nahr Jawbar is given as one of the five districts of the rich province (Ast\u0101n) of Ardash\u012br B\u0101bak\u0101n, which last was called after the founder of the Sassanian monarchy, whom the Greeks knew as Artaxerxes, son of Babek.\n\n[To be continued.]\nART. II.\u2014The Li Sao Poem and its Author. By the Rev. Professor Legge, Oxford.\n\nI. THE AUTHOR.\n\nThe Literature of China has been arranged by its scholars, as is well known, in four great divisions, bearing the names of Classical, Historical, Philosophical, and Belles-lettres or Polite Literature. Under each division there are various sub-divisions, but of the four the last is by far the most extensive. The Chinese name for it is Chi (\u96c6), meaning \"Collections,\" and it is of this only that the Papers which I now propose to submit to the Society lead me to give a somewhat particular account.\n\nThese Collections for the most part are only reprints. To use the words of Mr. Wylie, \"although some few original productions occasionally find their way into these repositories, they are almost entirely made up of works which have already appeared before the public in a detached form. This custom has tended to the preservation of numerous writings of all ages, which otherwise would have been known only by name from incidental quotations in more permanent authors. These Collections are analogous in some respects to Constable's Miscellany, Bohn's series, and others of the kind in England, but differ from them in that, instead of being published periodically, the complete series is issued at once as an indivisible whole, and it is only rarely that any of the separate works can be obtained second-hand from an already imperfect series.\"\n\nAn idea of the size of many of these Collections may be gained from the \"Explanations of the Classics during the Ch'ing (or Pure) dynasty (\u7687\u6e05\u7d93\u89e3),\" which was\npublished in 1829 under the superintendence, and very much at the expense, of Y\u00fcan Y\u00fcan (\u962e \u5143), the Governor-General of the two Kwang provinces. It contains, if my examination of the contents be correct, about 180 treatises from 64 different authors, comprehending in all 1,412 Books or chapters, and forming, when bound in English fashion, 66 thick volumes of large octavo size.\n\nThis compilation is too recent to have a place in the catalogue of the Imperial Library of the present dynasty, which was completed in 1790. The Ch\u00fc entered there are given under five subdivisions, the first of which, and to which alone my present subject invites attention, goes by the name of Ch\u00fc Ts'ze (\u695a \u8ad6), \"The Compositions of Ch\u00fc.\" But the peculiar character and style of the pieces thus classed together has been recognised from the first, and the designation of \"The Elegies of Ch\u00fc\" is now commonly applied to them all. The principal and longest piece in the Collection is called \"The Li S\u00e0o (\u96e2 \u9a37)\" = \"Fallen into (or Beset with) Sorrow.\" The late Marquis d'Hervey de Saint Denys, who published a translation of it in 1870, says that \"the name signifies Lamentations, songs of one who is fallen into sadness\"; and with this account of it there is little fault to find, though \"lamentations\" gives an idea which is not in the Chinese characters, however the poem may be characterised by sad and plaintive feeling. These elegies of Ch\u00fc form but a small collection of eight Books by six different authors, according to the arrangement of Ch\u00fc Hsi. The first five Books contain in all twenty-five pieces, the authorship of which is ascribed to Ch\u00fc Y\u00fcan (\u5c48 \u539f). The first Book is all occupied with the Li S\u00e0o, and its name is also given to the other four Books. The other three Books are denominated \"The Appendix to the Li S\u00e0o (\u7e8c \u96e2 \u9a37),\" the pieces in them being divided among Sung Y\u00fc (\u5b8b \u7389), Ching Ch\u00fc (\u666f \u5dee), Chi\u00e2 \u00ce (\u8cc8 \u8aa0), Chwang Ch\u00ee (\u838a \u5fcc), and one of the scholars who gathered round Li\u00fb An, a grandson of Li\u00fb Pang, the founder of the H\u00e1n dynasty, better known as the king of Hw\u00e1i-nan, and Hw\u00e1i-nan Tsze (\u6dee\u5357\u5b50, \u6dee \u5357 \u738b, \u5289 \u5b89). All these writers had a more\nor less intimate connection with the kingdom of Ch'\u00fc and its ruling family, and hence the Collection is called Ch'\u00fc Ts'ze, \"The Compositions or Elegies of Ch'\u00fc.\"\n\nI hasten now to relate what we know of the history of Ch'\u00fc P'ing (or Y\u00fcan), the author of the Li S\u00e1o. There is no name better known in China than his. His death\u2014or suicide, rather\u2014is commemorated every year on the fifth day of the fifth month, falling generally early in our month of June, and the commemoration is called \"The Festival of the Dragon Boats.\" Many, perhaps forty years ago, I was walking in the interior of Canton province, not far from its great East river which flows on to join the streams from the north and west at Whampoa. All at once my steps were arrested by a loud shouting from the river, and I hurried to the bank to see what was going on. There, as I stood above the water, I saw two boats, long and slender, each built to represent a dragon, the head of which rose high and formed the prow. A man sat upon it with a flag in each hand, which he waved to direct the movements of the crew, and with his face turned towards the helmsman who stood near the stern. Midway in the boats were two men beating with all their might, the one a gong, the other a drum. The crew in each boat could not have been fewer than thirty men, each grasping a short stout paddle, and all, with quivering eagerness and loud cries, racing towards a certain point. The scene came vividly before me when I first stood on one of our Oxford barges, and witnessed the conclusion of one of the races, the rowers exerting all their strength and skill, and the excited crowds on the banks running at the top of their speed, and shouting out the expression of their various sympathies. What were those men in the two dragon boats doing? They were racing, and having a good time, but they were, they would have told you, commemorating the death of the author of the Li S\u00e1o, and looking for the body of the patriot Ch'\u00fc Y\u00fcan, who had drowned himself in the Mi-lo (\u6c68\u7f85), a river of the province of H\u00fb-nan, more than 2200 years ago.\n\nA good memoir of our subject is found in the 24th Book\nof the Biographies of Sze-m\u00e2 Ch\u2019ien, the first great historian of his country, and entitled to a high place among the historians of other countries. I have now simply to relate to you, with some notes in passing, what I find in his pages.\n\nCh\u2019ien says that \u201cCh\u2019\u00fc Y\u00fcan\u2019s name was P\u2019ing (\u5e73).\u201d His father called him so at his naming, when a child, and afterwards, probably at his capping, he received the designation of Y\u00fcan (\u539f). We may call him therefore, indifferently, either Ch\u2019\u00fc P\u2019ing or Ch\u2019\u00fc Y\u00fcan. The name and the designation, as I will show in my next Paper, were intended to have the same significance. \u201cHe was a member of the ruling House of Ch\u2019\u00fb,\u201d which had long been one of the most powerful of the feudal States under the dynasty of Ch\u2019\u00e2u. Its original centre was in the present province of H\u00fb-p\u00eai, but in the course of centuries it had extended its territory east, north, and south, so that its ruler was now more powerful than the real King, the lord-paramount of all the States. Other States had pursued a similar course, and at the time of which we are speaking there were seven principal States, the rulers of each of which had usurped the title of king. There was a condition of chronic warfare among them, but the only match for Ch\u2019\u00fb was Ch\u2019in in the north and west. It became more and more evident as time went on that the final struggle for supremacy must be between these two.\n\nOur subject, I have said, was a member of the ruling House of Ch\u2019\u00fb, and belonged to one of the three princely families into which it had become divided, and the chiefs of which used as their surnames the names of the several appanages with which their different ancestors had been invested. Those were Ch\u00e1o (\u662d), Ch\u2019\u00fc (\u5c48), and Ching (\u666f). Ch\u2019\u00fc P\u2019ing, it would appear, had, moreover, a position at the court of Ch\u2019\u00fb like that which the prince-president of the Imperial Clan-court (\u5b97\u4eba\u5e9c) holds at the present day at Peking. It is his to regulate all affairs relating to the kindred of the ruling house, and to preserve their family roll or genealogical record. I call attention now to this official position of our subject because, as we shall\nsee, it is important to our understanding, and even crediting\nthe very important statement of his descent with which the\nLi Sao commences.\n\nI return to the narrative of Ch'ien, which says that Ch'\u00fc\nwas \"an attendant of king Hw\u00e2i on the left, a minister\npossessed of extensive information and with a strong memory,\nskilful in the maintenance of order, and admirable in the\ncomposition of governmental notifications and orders. In\ncouncil he deliberated with, and advised, the king on the\nbusiness of the State; out of council he was employed in\nthe reception of visitors and guests, and in communicating\nwith the princes (who came to court). The king employed\nhim very much. But the great officer of the highest grade, of\nthe same rank (as Y\u00fcan), had (long) striven for the favour\nwhich he enjoyed, and was his enemy at heart, wishing to\ndeprive him of his influence and power.\u00b9\n\n\"(On one occasion), when king Hw\u00e2i had appointed Ch'\u00fc\nP'ing to draw up a governmental proclamation, and he had\nmade a draft of it, but had not finally written it out, this\ngreat officer wished to carry it off, but Ch'\u00fc refused to give\nit to him. The other then slandered him (to the king),\nsaying, 'All are aware that your Majesty employs Ch'\u00fc\nP'ing to prepare your notifications. Whenever a notice\ncomes out, P'ing boasts of his services, and says, \"If it\nwere not for me, they could do nothing.\" This made\nthe king angry. He treated Ch'\u00fc with coldness, and kept\nhim at a distance.\n\n\"On his part Ch'\u00fc was indignant that the king listened\n(to such a charge against him) without discrimination; that\nslanderers and flatterers were able to obscure the king's in-\ntelligence; that the justice of his words was perverted by\ntheir injurious and contemptible misrepresentations, while\nhis right and correctness were not acknowledged. He\ntherefore became sorrowful, brooded moodily over his case,\n\n\u00b9 There is some difficulty in interpreting this last sentence. See Ch\u00fb Hsi's\nnote on it in his Pi\u00ean Ch'ang (\u8faf \u8b70), p. 2. He differs from the view of\nWang Yi, and prefers that of Hung Haing-te\u00fb of our 12th century.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1895.\nand composed the *Li Sao*, which may be considered as equivalent to 'Beset with sorrow.'\n\n\"Now man owes his beginning to Heaven, and he grows from the root of his parents. When his term (of life) is exhausted, he returns to his root. Therefore, when burdened, pained, and wearied out, men always cry out to Heaven; and when afflicted and severely wounded or grieved, they call out to their parents. Ch'\u00fc P'ing, pursuing a correct and straightforward path, had strained his loyalty and tasked his wisdom to the utmost to serve his ruler; and then came in the slanderer and separated between them. He might be described as reduced to extremity. True and yet doubted, loyal and yet slandered, could he repress the feeling of resentment? His making of the *Li Sao* certainly arose from the feeling of resentment.\"\n\nThis account of the origin of the *Li Sao* is, no doubt, in a great measure correct. But we shall find that there are other feelings in it of a better character as well. I pause for a moment in Ch'ien's biography, and ask how nearly we can approximate to the dates of our subject's death, and of the composition of his principal poem. Mayers says that he was in the service of king Hw\u00e2i about 314 B.C.; but his disgrace had taken place before that year. Hw\u00e2i succeeded to the throne of Ch'\u00fb in 328 B.C., and died as a captive in Ch'in in 296, being succeeded by his son, known as king Ch'ing-hsiang (\u9803\u8944\u738b). Two different years are assigned as the first year of this son's reign, 298 B.C. and 295, of which an explanation can be given, with which I need not detain you. It was by him that Ch'\u00fc P'ing was banished from Ch'\u00fb; and he had proceeded as far as a well-known spot on the bank of the Mi-lo river, when he clasped a large stone in his arms, and plunged into the water. When the Marquis d'Herv\u00e9y refers the composition of the *Li Sao* to the year 299 B.C. he cannot be far wrong; but we do not know exactly the\n\n---\n\n1 This is the explanation of the title, accepted by Sze-m\u00e2 Ch'ien, Pan K\u00fb, and Yen Sze-K\u00fb, and is preferred by Ch\u00fb Hs\u00ee to that of Wang Yi.\nyear of the author's birth or of his death, or of the finishing touch which he gave to his principal poem.\n\nHaving been led to mention the Li Sao, Sze-m\u00e2 Ch'ien proceeds to speak of it and of Ch'\u00fc Y\u00fcan himself in eulogistic terms. He says: \"In 'The Lessons from the States,' we have the love of beauty, but no expression of lasciviousness. In 'The Minor Odes of the Kingdom,' we have indignant complaint of slanderers, but with no incitement to violent disturbance. In the Li Sao we have what may be called the union of these excellences. The author celebrates the most ancient Ti K'u, speaks of duke Hwan of Ch'i of a comparatively recent time, and between them he tells about T'ang and Wu, passing (as he does so) his critical judgment on the affairs of the world, illustrating how wide is the path of duty and virtue, and exalting the method of dealing with disorder and bringing it to an end. Every point in these subjects is displayed; yet the style is condensed, and the language is subtle and exquisite. The spirit that breathes in the poem is pure, as the author's conduct was disinterested. His words are few, but the aim of them is very great. His illustrations are from things near at hand, but the meaning of them is far-reaching. His purposes were pure, and therefore his composition partook of the fragrancy of perfumes. His course was incorrupt, and therefore he would have died rather than allow himself to be slighted as he was, and cast out into a miry, muddy pool. Like a chrysalis amidst the wet and dirt, he was still the brilliant fly. Though lying among the dust, Society could impart to him nothing of its filth. He still remained clean, no stain of the foulness resting upon him. So pure in aim was he, that he might be compared in his brightness to the splendour of the sun and moon.\"\n\n1 The first part of the Shih Ching.\n2 The second part of the Shih (\u96c5).\n3 I have failed to discover the mention of Ti K'u in the poem, but see stanza 60, and the note on it. Duke Hwan appears in stanza 75.\n4 The \u6f02\u6e38 of Ch'ien's text should be \u8702\u6e38. See the Shih, I. xiv. 1, and the notes on it.\nFrom this digression Ch\u2019ien returns to his narrative of affairs, and says: After Ch\u2019\u00fc P\u2019ing was dismissed from office, Ch\u2019in proposed to attack Ch\u2019i,\\(^1\\) the ruler of which in consequence paid court to Ch\u2019\u00fc, and arranged for a matrimonial alliance with it. This alliance alarmed and troubled king H\u00fbi of Ch\u2019in,\\(^2\\) whose principal adviser and minister, indeed, was Chang \u00ce, an able man, but one of the political intriguers of the time whom Mencius, who was their contemporary, so strongly condemned.\\(^3\\) To break off the good understanding between Ch\u2019\u00fc and Ch\u2019i, the king employed the services of this adventurer. Supplied with abundant means for bribery and gifts, Chang \u00ce pretended to fly from Ch\u2019in and seek refuge in Ch\u2019\u00fc. There, having succeeded in opening a communication with king Hw\u00e2i, he told him that he had come to Ch\u2019\u00fc with a secret message from the king of Ch\u2019in:\\(^4\\)\u2014that if he would break off his friendship with Ch\u2019i, Ch\u2019in would cede to him 600 li of the territory of Shang-y\u00fc.\\(^4\\) King Hw\u00e2i, in his greed, believed Chang \u00ce, broke off his friendship with Ch\u2019i, and sent a commissioner to Ch\u2019in to receive the promised territory. But Chang \u00ce (who had managed in the meantime to return to Ch\u2019in) now threw off the mask, and said to the commissioner, \u201cWhat I agreed about with your king was six li; I heard nothing about six hundred!\u201d King Hw\u00e2i\u2019s messenger went back to Ch\u2019\u00fc in a rage, and reported to the king how they had been imposed on. The king was equally indignant, and raised a large army, which he sent against Ch\u2019in. Ch\u2019in on its part despatched a force to meet it. A great battle was fought, in which the army of Ch\u2019\u00fc was defeated, with the loss, it is said, of 80,000 men and the capture of its commander, Ch\u2019\u00fc K\u2019ai\n\n\\(^1\\) The great State of the north-east, and formerly more powerful than either Ch\u2019in or Ch\u2019\u00fc.\n\n\\(^2\\) \u201cKing H\u00fbi,\u201d I suppose, is a mistake of Ch\u2019ien for King H\u00fbi-w\u00e4n (\u60e0\u6587\u738b), who ruled in Ch\u2019in from B.C. 336 to 307.\n\n\\(^3\\) See Works of Mencius, III., ii. 2.\n\n\\(^4\\) Forming the present district of N\u00e9i-hsiang (\u5167\u9109) in the department of Nan-yang (\u5357\u967d), Ho-nan.\nThis defeat was followed by the loss of the territory of Han-chung, which is still the name of one of the departments of Shen-hsi. On this king Hwai called out all the military strength of his kingdom and led it deep into Ch'in, with whose forces another battle was fought at Lan-t'ien. At this juncture the State of Wei (\u9b4f), one of the divisions into which Tsin had been broken up, took advantage of the difficulties of Ch'\u00fc with Ch'in, and sent a force against it, which penetrated as far as the city of Fang, and the army of Ch'\u00fc was necessarily recalled to combat this new enemy. Its straits also were all the greater because Ch'i, with which king Hwai had broken off all friendly relations, refused to lend it any assistance.\n\nIn the next year, however, Ch'in offered to give to it the territory of Han-chung, and to conclude a treaty of peace; but king Hwai said, \"I do not wish to get territory. I wish to get Chang \u00ce, and with nothing else will I be satisfied.\" When Chang \u00ce heard this, he said to his sovereign, \"Since I am counted in my single person equal to the territory of Han-chung, allow me to go to Ch'\u00fc.\" To Ch'\u00fc accordingly he went, provided abundantly with the same resources as before; and there, by large bribes to the high minister and director of affairs, Chin Shang (\u9773\u5c1a), and wheedling speeches to Chang Hsi\u00fb (\u912d\u8896), the king's favourite lady, it came about that he was allowed to return again to Ch'in.\n\nOur subject, Ch'\u00fc P'ing, now appears again on the stage. Though in disgrace at court, he had been sent on a mission to Ch'i. Returning to Ch'\u00fc just at this time, he remonstrated with the king, saying, \"Why did you not put Chang \u00ce to death?\" The king regretted he had not done so, and sent a party in pursuit to apprehend and bring him back, but they failed to overtake him. Ch'ien adds here that after this\n\n1 These events all appear in the Kang-m\u00fb, under the years B.C. 313, 312.\n2 Meaning \"Indigo Fields.\" A district of the department of Hsi-an still bears the name.\n3 This must be king Chiao-hsiang (\u662d\u8944), who had come to the throne in B.C. 306, and occupied it till 250.\nseveral of the other States or kingdoms united in an attack on Ch'\u00fc, and inflicted on it a great defeat, killing also its general, T'ang-m\u00eai (\u5510 \u5473).\u00b9\n\nAmidst all the contentions and fightings of the States; negociations of a different kind went on. The young king of Ch'in obtained the hand of a princess of Ch'\u00fc, and invited, though with a sinister object, king Hw\u00e2i to visit him in Ch'in. Hw\u00e2i himself wished to accept the invitation, but Ch'\u00fc P'ing protested vehemently against such a step. \"Ch'in,\" said he, \"may be compared to a tiger or a wolf, and is not to be trusted. Your Majesty had better not go.\" Tsze-lan, the king's youngest son, however, advised his father to go, saying \"Why should you disappoint the good will of Ch'in?\" and in the end king Hw\u00e2i undertook the journey. When he had gone through the Pass of W\u00fb,\u00b2 leading into Ch'in, an ambuscade, which had been set for the purpose, prevented his retreating by it. He was detained a prisoner in Ch'in, and urged continually to cede portions of his territory. To this demand he would not listen, and in 297, irritated by it, he fled to Ch'ao, the capital of which was in the present department of P'ing-yang in Shan-hsi. They were afraid to receive him there. He was taken back to Ch'in, and died in it, as has been already mentioned, in B.C. 296.\n\nHis body was sent back in its coffin, and buried in Ch'\u00fc, where his eldest son, known as king Ch'ing-hsiang, as mentioned above, had already taken his place and made his younger brother, Tsze-lan, one of his chief counsellors. But the people could not forgive this prince, who had advised his father to go to Ch'in. Ch'\u00fc Y\u00fcan also retained his feeling against him. From the time when he first fell into disgrace, Ch'\u00fc had all along kept his attachment to king Hw\u00e2i, and was ever wishing him to reform, hoping that\n\n\u00b9 This event is given in the Kang-m\u00fb as having taken place in B.C. 301. The attacking States are there given as Ch'in, Han, Wei, and Ch'i.\n\n\u00b2 \u6b66 \u9598, called also the Southern Pass to Ch'in. It was in the present Shen Ch'\u00e2u of Ho-nan. The capture of king Hw\u00e2i when he had entered it was in B.C. 299.\nif the sovereign came to himself, his ministers would also change their ways. The subjects which he was always revolving in his mind were\u2014how the king could be preserved and the kingdom restored to prosperity. These are the subjects which constantly appear in the Li Sao. But after all nothing could be done. The king did not return from Ch'in, and it became clear that he could not be made to perceive the real state of things.\n\nAt this point in his narrative, Ch'ien again pauses and moralizes. \"Rulers,\" he says, \"whether wise or stupid, worthy or unworthy, all wish to get loyal officers, who shall be of service to themselves, and to promote such as will assist them in their government by their wisdom and talent. But the ruin of the State and the breaking up of the Family are closely connected. And when in successive reigns a sage ruler does not appear, then the naturally loyal become disloyal, and those who should prove themselves wise and talented do not do so. King Hwai, not recognising the service of his loyal minister, was led astray in his harem by the lady Hei of Chang, and was imposed on by Chang I in his court. Through his treating Ch'\u00fc Y\u00fcan coldly, and giving his confidence to the High Officer, Chin Shang, and to Tsze-lan, who became chief minister, the prowess of his soldiers decayed, and his kingdom was dismembered, six provinces were lost, and he himself died, a captive in Ch'in and an object of derision to all within the four seas. All this was the evil that sprang from his not knowing men. The Yi-ching says, 'The well has been cleared, but (its water) is not used. My heart is afflicted for this, for the water might be drawn out and employed. If the king were intelligent, both he and I would receive the benefit of it. When the king is not intelligent, how is it possible to obtain that benefit?'\"\n\nAfter this homily, the historian returns to the story of Ch'\u00fc Y\u00fcan, and concludes it thus: \"When the chief minister heard of Ch'\u00fc's dissatisfaction, he was enraged, and made\n\n1 See the Yi, Hexagram xliviii. l. 3, or the Symbolism of it, though Ch'ien's reading of the Symbolism is slightly varied.\nthe great officer Chin Shang complain of his conduct to king Ch'ing-hsiang, who also was angry, and finally gave orders that Ch'\u00fc should be banished (to the wild region of the south). When he came to the (Mi-lo) stream,\\(^1\\) he moved all about it, groaning and sobbing, with his hair dishevelled, and his whole appearance worn and withered. A fisherman\\(^2\\) saw him in this condition, and asked him, saying, 'Are you not, sir, the great officer in charge of the three branches of our Royal House? What has brought you here, and to such distress?' Ch'\u00fc Y\u00fcan replied, 'The whole world is foul, and I alone am clean. All others are intoxicated, and I alone am sober. Thus it is that I have been banished.' The fisherman said, 'The true sage is not ice-bound by anything, but is able to change with the changing world. If the whole world be in a state of confusion and defilement, why not follow its stream, and toss its waves about? If all others be drunk, why not drink the dregs of their spirit, and eat of the grains that are left behind? Why must you keep your jasper in your breast and hold your lustrous stone in your hand, and cause\n\n\\(^1\\) I extract the following from a note in the Kang-m\u00fb under b.c. 299: \"Mi-lo is the name of a river in the department of Ch'ang-sh\u00e2, H\u00fb-nan. Its source is in Ch'\u00e2ng-hsi, from which it flows into the district of Hsiang-yin (\u6e58\u9670). About 8 li from the district city it begins its course through the district, after which it divides into two branches. One branch flows south, and is called the Mi stream; the other flows past the old city of Lo, and is called the Lo river. Holding on their separate courses to the pool of Ch'\u00fc (\u5c48\u6f6d), they there again unite, and flow westwards to the great river Hsiang (\u6e58), which is a tributary of the great Chiang.\" It is added that Ch'\u00fc Y\u00fcan, on the fifth day of the fifth month, threw himself into the Mi-lo river, and that the people of Ch'\u00fc to this day, in lamentation for his death, present offerings of rice to him, in tubes of bamboo. All this appears in the Kang-m\u00fb under b.c. 299; but it does not follow that the suicide of our hero took place in that year.\n\n\\(^2\\) This fisherman is supposed to have been a recluse living in obscurity because of the badness of the time. In the account of the interview with him, Ch'ien borrows his text from the last of the \"Elegies\" ascribed to our author. Such is the tradition concerning it, but we may doubt if it be correctly so ascribed.\nyourself to be sent into banishment?\" Ch'\u00fc Y\u00fcan replied, 'I have heard that when one has newly washed his head he must fillip the dust from his cap (before he replaces it), and when he has newly bathed, he must shake his clothes (before he puts them on again). How can one whose person is clean and pure allow himself to be defiled by the filth around him? I would rather throw myself into this great stream and be buried in the belly of a fish. And how can I allow the whiteness of my purity to be hidden beneath the darkness and opposition of the world?'  \n\n\"He then made his piece called 'The Stone clasped to the Breast.' . . . . . . Having done this, he took a (large) stone in his arms, threw himself with it into the Mi-lo, and was drowned.\"\n\nSo died Ch'\u00fc Y\u00fcan, the nobleman and poet of Ch'\u00fc. All the higher classes of that kingdom must have been acquainted with the events of his history. Many, no doubt, sympathized with him and pitied his fate. In less than a hundred years after his death Chi\u00e2 \u00ce (\u8cc8\u8ae0), a celebrated scholar, and tutor to the king of Ch'ang-sh\u00e2, one of the sons of W\u00e4n, the second emperor of the dynasty of Han, when passing the pool of Mi-lo into which Ch'\u00fc Y\u00fcan had thrown himself, cast into it a writing which he had prepared by way of condolence with the spirit of the outraged and persecuted patriot. This, it is supposed, was the first instance of the special tribute to our subject, which has\n\n---\n\n1 \u61f7\u747e\u63e1\u745c is translated by Williams, \"He is a man of great clearness and sagacity.\" Giles renders, not so happily as he generally does: \"How with such jewels of hand and heart could he cause himself to be dismissed.\" I render \u747e by \"jasper\" for want of a more exact term.\n\n2 The second half of this sentence, \u8cc8\u4e16\u4e4b\u6eab\u8816, is very difficult. In the \"Elegies\" we read \u8cc8\u4e16\u4fd7\u4e4b\u5875\u57c3, which is easy. A note in Wang's edition of the \u53f2\u8a18 for \u6e29\u8816 gives \u60dc\u61a4, which I have followed. Giles, keeping Ch'ien's text, renders it by \"a butt for the world's folly.\"\n\n3 This forms the twelfth of the \"Elegies,\" called \u5c48\u539f, the fifth of those appended to the collection of the Li S\u00e1o.\nbeen perpetuated to the present day in the festival of the Dragon Boats soon after the beginning of the fifth month.\n\nCh'\u00fc's death, moreover, though it did not originate, has confirmed the feeling of the Chinese people generally that when a minister or high officer has sustained a defeat, or been disgraced by his sovereign, the proper course for him is to end his life by an act of his own. I was in Hong-kong when the city of Canton was taken, on the 29th December, 1857, by our troops and their French allies. A Chinese gentleman, with whom I was intimate, called on me next morning to ask whether the city had really been taken, and when told that it had been taken, and was now in our hands, he said, \"And Yeh the Governor? Has he also been taken?\" I replied that there was as yet no news to that effect, and he exclaimed, \"And he will not be taken alive, you may depend on it. He must have made away with himself. There can be no doubt about it.\" When the next day I had to inform him of the capture of Yeh, and that he had been placed on board one of our ships of war, he had not a word to say, and went away evidently disheartened and ashamed. I could see that from that time Yeh's character sank in the estimation of the people. He ceased to be the hero whom they had feared and looked up to; had he not been afraid to put an end by his own hand to his now dishonoured life? That is in their estimation what Burns, with a very different meaning, calls \"the second glorious part\" which a patriot, warrior or statesman, can perform.\n\nIn my second Paper I will endeavour to give an analysis of the Li Sao poem, dwelling especially on the most peculiar portions of it. Ch'\u00fc Yuan was not a Confucianist, and there is not any mention in his writings of the great sage. His affinities were more with Taoism than with the doctrines of the Literati; but I do not think I have observed in his pieces any direct reference to Lao-tse. Such Taoist writers as Lieh-tsze, Li\u00fb An, Han Fei, and Chwang-tsze frequently introduce both the one philosopher and the other. Chwang-tsze especially delights in making game of Confucius, but\nCh'\u00fc is too much centred and concentrated in himself to wander much from his own experiences. With the history of ancient China, as it may be gathered from the classical books and the semi-historical narratives of the feudal times, he was well acquainted; and he confirms our faith in the chronological beliefs of Confucius and Mencius. But the home of his mind was in the folk-lore or fairy-lore of the T\u0101oist system, while at the same time he had many queer and absurd notions of his own, which remind us of the words of Waller to Charles the Second, \"Poets, Sire, succeed best in fiction.\"\n\nIt has been seen that the last thing which our subject did before committing his act of suicide was to write his poem called \"The Stone clasped to the Breast,\"\u00b9 and with a few stanzas from it I will conclude this article.\n\n\"How vast is the stream in this first month of summer!\nHow luxuriant the grass and the trees!\nWith wounded heart and constant grief\nI press along to the regions of the south.\n\n\"My eyes are dazed by the landscape so strange,\nSo still, retired, and silent.\nMy wrongs are knotted into a constant sorrow;\nIt pains me and exhausts my strength.\nI lay my head on my breast and search my mind;\nI bow my will, and repress my fears.\n\n\"(My enemies) change white into black,\nAnd turn the upside down;\nThe ph\u0153nix is kept in a cage,\nWhile the fowls and ducks fly and dance.\n\n\"Like dogs they bark at me in troops,\u00b2\nThey bark at me as something strange;\nTo slander eminence like mine\nIs indeed the way of vulgar men.\n\n\u00b9 Book IV. piece v.\n\u00b2 Compare Ps. lix. 6, 7.\n\"If I take the road, and retrace my way to the north,\nAll the day to the evening will be gloom.\nI indulge my sorrow, and find pleasure in my grief,\nTo last till the great event come.\n\n\"How grandly the Y\u00fcan and Hsiang\nFlow on in their separate courses!\nLong is their course and hidden,\nDistant is the way and difficult.\n\n\"All men receive the appointment of Heaven,\nAnd each man has his definite lot.\nWith determined mind and enlarged will,\nWhat have I to fear?\n\n\"I know that death is not to be declined;\nI wish not to love my life.\nClearly I announce this to all superior men,\nAnd show them the example of what they ought to do.\"\n\nSuch was Ch'\u00fc Yuan's dying advice, enforced by his daring deed.\nART. III.\u2014Se\u00fcma Ch'ien's Historical Records. By Herbert J. Allen, M.R.A.S.\n\n(Continued from page 295, Vol. for 1894.)\n\nCHAPTER II.\u2014The Hsia Dynasty.\n\nY\u00fc of Hsia \"was styled W\u00eanming.\"\u00b9 Y\u00fc's father was Kun, whose father was the Emperor Ch'uanhs\u00fc, whose father was Ch'angyi, whose father was Huangti; so Y\u00fc was Huangti's great-great-grandson, and Ch'uanhs\u00fc's grandson. Y\u00fc's great-grandfather Ch'angyi and his father Kun were both unable to sit on the Imperial throne, being simply officials. In the time of the Emperor Yao:\u00b2 \"the deluge assailed the heavens, and in its vast expanse encompassed the mountains, and overtopped the hills, so that the common people were troubled about it. Yao sought for one capable of controlling the waters. All the officials and presidents of the four mountains said, 'Kun might do it.' Yao said, 'Kun is a man who disobeys orders, and ruins his companions. He will not do.' The president of the four mountains said,\" Among his equals there is no one so worthy as Kun; I wish your Majesty would \"try him.\" Upon which Yao, giving heed to the president of\n\n\u00b9 W\u00eanming means literally 'accomplishments and orders.' In the 'Counsels of the Great Y\u00fc' (L. C. III. p. 52) the Emperor Y\u00fc is so named. That chapter of the Book of History is not further referred to by our historian; but we have all the other books of Y\u00fc and books of Hsia either transcribed, or referred to.\n\n\u00b2 This passage from the 'Canon of Yao,' which we have already had in the first chapter of the Historical Records, appears later in the transcript from the 'Yi and Chi.'\nthe four mountains, employed Kun to control the waters \"for nine years,\" but the waters did not abate, \"and the work was unaccomplished.\" Then the Emperor Yao sought a man in his stead, and secured Shun. Shun being employed in the public service was associated with the Son of Heaven in the administration. While on a tour of inspection, he saw that there was no evidence that Kun kept the waters under control, so \"he imprisoned him for life on Mount Yu,\" and everyone in the Empire said that Shun's decision was a just one. Shun then appointed Kun's son Y\u00fc to the post, and directed him to continue his father's occupation. After Yao's death, the Emperor Shun\u00b9 \"asked the president of the four mountains if there was any one who could perfect and develop Yao's undertakings, and whom he could employ in an official capacity. They all said, 'There is lord Y\u00fc, the Minister of Works; he might perfect and develop Yao's labours.' Shun said, 'Ah yes! you, Y\u00fc, have regulated the water and the land, but in this office you must exert yourself.' Y\u00fc did obeisance with his head to the ground, and would have declined in favour of Hsieh, Prince Millet, or Kaoyao, but Shun said 'Go and attend to your duties.'\" Y\u00fc was quick, earnest, and diligent, not deviating from virtue, kind, and lovable; his word could be depended on, his voice was musical, and his body, like a balance properly adjusted, moved unweariedly and solemnly in accordance with certain fixed rules. Y\u00fc, then in company with Yi and Prince Millet, having received the Emperor's orders, bade the princes and people raise a gang of men\u00b2 \"to make a division of the land, and following the line of the hills hew down the trees, and determine the characteristics of the high hills and great rivers.\" Y\u00fc was grieved in that his progenitor Kun had been punished on account of his work being incomplete, so, wearied in body and distressed in\n\n\u00b9 Parts of the 'Canon of Shun' (para. 12 and 17) are again quoted here.\n\u00b2 The first paragraph of the 'Tribute of Y\u00fc' (L. C. III. p. 92) is here quoted.\nmind, he lived away from his home for 13 years, passing the door of his house without daring to enter. With ragged clothes and poor diet he paid his devotions to the spirits until his wretched hovel fell in ruins in the ditch. When travelling along the dry land he used a carriage, on the water he used a boat, in miry places a sledge, while in going over the hills he used spikes. On the one hand he used the marking-line, and on the other the compass and square. Working as the seasons permitted, and with a view to \"open up the nine provinces,\" he made the roads communicable, banked up the marshes, surveyed the hills, told Yi and his band that paddy should be planted in low damp places, and directed Lord Millet and his band, \"when it was difficult to obtain food, or when food was scarce, to barter their surplus stock in exchange for what they had not,\" so as to put all the princes on an equal footing. Yu in this way worked for the mutual convenience of the respective districts as regards the distribution of the wealth and resources of the country.\n\nYu started from Ch'ichow. He \"commenced his work in Ch'ichow at Pot's mouth, and regulated the country about the Liang and Ch'i mountains. Having repaired the works at T'aiyuan he went to the south of Mount Yo. He was successful with his labours at Tanhuai, and went to the cross-flowing stream of Chang. The soil of the province was white clay. Its contribution of revenue was the first of\n\n---\n\n1 In the 'Works of Mencius' (L. C. II. p. 127) the passage reads, \"Yu was eight years away from his home, and though he thrice passed the door of it he did not enter.\"\n\n2 These passages appear in the transcript from 'Yi and Chi' below.\n\n3 We have now the rest of the Yu Kung (Tribute of Yu) transcribed in its entirety. Dr. Legge in the notes to his translation of this book says very rightly, \"The name, the tribute of Yu, gives a very insufficient account of the contents. The determination of the revenue, and of the various articles of tribute was, indeed, very important, but the book describes generally the labours of Yu in remedying the disasters occasioned by the overflowing waters?\" It seems indeed to be just a description of the mountains and rivers of the several provinces of China. Of course no one, not even the great Yu, could have performed the Herculean task he is by some credited with doing. Dr. Legge, in fact, says with regard to the second part of the book (p. 129), \"we cannot suppose that Yu travelled again along the hills or the rivers, for in that case his toil would have been endless.\"\nthe highest class with some admixture of the second, while its fields were the average of the middle class. The Ch'ang and Wei rivers flowed in their proper channels, and the Talu plain was formed. The bird barbarians,\\(^1\\) wearing skin dresses, kept close on the right to the granite rocks until they came to the sea. The Ch'i and Yellow rivers formed the boundaries of Yenchow. The nine branches of the Yellow river followed their courses, and Lei hsia was a marsh, in which the Yung and Ch\u00fc streams were united. The mulberry region was supplied with silkworms, and then the people came down from the heights and occupied it. The soil of the province was black loam, its herbage luxuriant, and trees tall. Its fields were the lowest of the middle class. Its contribution of revenue was fixed at what would just be deemed the correct amount, and after it had been worked for 13 years it was assimilated to the other provinces. Its tribute consisted of varnish and silk, and woven ornamental fabrics in baskets. You float along the Ch'i and T'a and so reach the Yellow river. The sea and the Tai mountain formed the boundaries of Ch'ingchow. The territory of Y\u00fc-i was defined, and the Wei and Tz\u016d rivers flowed in their proper channels. The soil of the province was white loam, and on the sea-coast were wide tracts of salt land. Its fields, which were impregnated with salt, were the lowest of the first class, and its contribution of revenue the highest of the second. Its tribute consisted of salt, fine cloth of dolichos fibre, and productions of the sea of various kinds, with silk, hemp, lead, pine-trees,\n\n\\(^1\\) The bird barbarians are said to refer to a people living in the north-east who ate the flesh of birds and beasts, and wore their skins. A commentator says that these were the Mohos or Sush\u00e9ns, i.e. the Tungusiac ancestors of the Manchus, who lived on the eastern seabord, north of the Ever White mountains. Their birds, beasts, trees, and all were white. They dwelt in the forests, but the country was so cold that they frequently inhabited deep holes in the ground. They kept pigs, ate pork, wore pigskins, and smeared themselves with lard several inches thick to keep off the winter's cold, were very dirty in their habits, but good archers, shooting with a bow four feet long, and using arrows 1 ft. 8 in. long tipped with stone. At their funerals they piled hundreds of dead pigs on their coffins to serve as food for the deceased. The wooden coffin was bound with cords, and on the top, which protruded from the ground, they poured a libation of wine until the cords rotted.\nand strange stones from the valleys of the Tai. The wild tribes of Lai were shepherds, and brought in their baskets silk from the mountain mulberry. You float down the W\u00ean, and so reach the Ch'i. The sea, the Tai mountain, and the river Huai formed the boundaries of Hsiuchow. The Huai and I rivers were regulated. The M\u00eang and Y\u00fc mountains were made fit for cultivation. The waters of Tayeh formed a marsh, and the eastern plain became level. The soil of this province was red, clayey, and rich. The grass and trees grew more and more bushy. Its fields were the second of the highest class, and its contribution of revenue was the average of the second. Its tribute consisted of earth of different colours, the variegated pheasants from the valleys of mount Y\u00fc, the solitary dryandra from the south of mount Yi, and the floating musical stones from the banks of the Sz\u00fc. The wild tribes of the Huai brought oyster-pearls and fish, and their baskets were full of dark embroideries and pure white silken fabrics. You float along the Huai and Sz\u00fc and so reach the Yellow river. The Huai river and the sea formed the boundaries of Yangchow. The Pi'engli lake formed a reservoir of water, where the sun birds (i.e. the wild geese) settled. The three large rivers entered the sea, and the shaking marsh became quite still. Bamboos of different kinds were spread about, the grass grew luxuriantly, and the trees tall, but the soil was miry. The fields of this province were the lowest of the lowest class; its contribution of revenue was the highest of the lowest class, with a proportion of the class above. Its tribute consisted of gold, silver, and copper, jasper, pearls, bamboos of various kinds, ivory, hides, feathers, and hair. The wild people of the isles brought garments of grass; their baskets were filled with woven silks and cowries, and their bundles contained small oranges and pummeloes, which were rendered when required. You follow the course of the Great river and the sea, and so reach the Huai and Sz\u00fc rivers. Mount Ching and the south of Mount H\u00eang formed the boundaries of Chingchow. The\nGreat river and Han rivers paid their court to the sea. The nine rivers occupied all the middle of the land. The T'o and Ch'ien rivers flowed in their proper channels; and the land in the Y\u00fcn and M\u00eang marshes was made capable of cultivation. The soil of this province was miry; its fields were the average of the lowest class; its contribution of revenue was the lowest of the highest class. Its tribute consisted of feathers, hair, ivory, hides, gold, silver, copper, woods of the wild varnish, cudrania, triloba, juniper, and cypress trees, with grindstones, whetstones, stone arrowheads, and cinnabar, likewise the Ch'\u00fcn and Lu bamboos, and the wood of the redthorn, of which the three states brought the most noted specimens. The three-ribbed rush was put in cases which were wrapped up, while the baskets were filled with dark and purple silks and strings of coarse pearls. From the country of the nine rivers the great tortoise was presented. You float down the Great river, the T'o, the Ch'ien, and the Han rivers, cross over to the Lo, whence you reach the southern part of the Yellow river. The Ching mountain and the Yellow river formed the boundaries of Y\u00fcchow. The I, the Lo, the Ch'an, and the Chien streams flowed into the Yellow river, the Yungpo waters formed a lake, and the waters of the K'o marsh were conducted to the Ming reservoir. The soil of this province was clayey, while in its lower parts it was rich, and in clods. Its fields were the highest of the middle class; its contribution of revenue was the average of the highest class, with a proportion of the very highest. The tribute was varnish, silk, fine cloth of dolichos fibre, and sackcloth. The baskets were filled with delicate embroidery and floss-silk, and stones for polishing musical stones were rendered when required. You float along the Lo until you reach the Yellow river. The south of Mount Hua and the Blackwater formed the boundaries of Liangchow. The Min and Po hills were cultivated. The T'o and Ch'ien rivers flowed in their channels, sacrifices were offered to the hills Ts'ai and M\u00eang on the plateaux, and the wild tribes on the Ho river were\nsuccessfully managed. The soil of the province was bluish black. Its fields were the highest of the lowest class; its contribution of revenue was the average of the lowest class, with proportions of the rates above and below. Its tribute consisted of the best gold, iron, silver, steel, stone arrowheads, musical stones, and nets woven from the hair of bears and foxes. From Hsiching you come along the river Huan, float down the Ch\u2018ien, cross over to the Mien, enter the Wei, and ferry across the Yellow river. The Blackwater and the western bend of the Yellow river formed the boundaries of Yungchow. The Jo water flowed westward; the Ching, the Ch\u2018i, and Ch\u00fc streams formed a junction with the Wei, as also did the waters of the F\u00eang. The Ching and Ch\u2018i hills were sacrificed too, and so were those of Chungnan and Tunwu all the way to \u2018Bird-and-Rat\u2019 hill. Successful measures were taken with the plains and swamps as far as the Tuyeh marsh. The people of Sanwei were controlled, and the Sanmiao tribes kept in good order. The soil of the province was yellow clay. Its fields were the highest of the highest class, while its contribution of revenue was the lowest of the second. Its tribute was jade, topazes, and white cornelian stones. From \u2018Stonepile\u2019 hill you float on to \u2018Dragongate\u2019 on the western branch of the Yellow river at its junction with the Wei river. The western Jung tribes from the Kunlun, Hsichih, and Ch\u2018\u00fcsou mountains with their hair-cloth and furs were kept in order. Journeying over the nine mountains, you go from Ch\u2018ien and Ch\u2018i hills to mount Ching; passing the Yellow river, Pot\u2019smouth, and Leishow you come to T\u2019aiyo; from Tich\u2018u and Hsich\u00eang hills to \u2018King\u2019s house\u2019; from T\u2019aihung and Mount Ch\u2018ang to the granite rocks and the sea; from Hsiching, Chuyu, and \u2018Bird-and-Rat\u2019 hills to mount T\u2019aihua; from \u2018Bear\u2019s-ear,\u2019 Waifang, and T\u2018ungpo hills to Peiwei; you journey from Pochung to mount Ching; from Neifang to Tapish, and from the south of Mount Min to Mount H\u00eang,\n\n1 This hill seems to be called subsequently \u2018Bird-and-rat-in-the-same-hole\u2019 hill.\nand cross the nine rivers to the Fuchien plain. Following the course of the nine large rivers: from the Jo river you go to Holi, whence the superfluous water flows into the Rolling sands. You trace the Blackwater to Sanwei, where it enters the southern sea; you trace the Yellow river from 'Stone-pile' to 'Dragongate,' southward to the north of Mount Hua, eastward to Tich'u, again eastward to the ford of M\u00eang, eastward you pass the junction of the Lo river to Tapei, northward past the Chiang water to Talu, northward the stream is divided and becomes the nine rivers, reunited it forms the opposing river and flows into the sea. From Pochung you trace the course of the Yang. Flowing eastward it becomes the Han, further east it becomes the Ts'anglang water, passing the three dykes it goes to T'aipieh, southward it enters the great river, eastward whirling on it forms the P'\u00eangli marah, again eastward it forms the northern great river and enters the sea. From mount Min you trace the great river, which branching to the east becomes the T'o, again eastward it comes to the Li, passes the nine great rivers and comes to the eastern ridge, flows eastward, winds to the north, and joins the eddies, eastward it becomes the middle great river and enters the sea. Tracing the course of the Y\u00fcn river\u2014it flows to the east, becomes the Chi, enters the Yellow river, flows on and becomes the Yung; eastward it comes out to the north of Taoch'iu, further east flows into the Ko marsh, again north-eastward it unites with the W\u00ean, and still further to the north-east it enters the sea. Tracing the course of the Huai from T'ungpo\u2014to the eastward it unites with the Ssu and I rivers, and flowing to the east enters the sea. Tracing the course of the Wei from 'Bird-and-rat-in-the-same-hole' hill\u2014it unites to the east with the F\u00eang, further to the north-east it flows into the Ching, to the east passing the Ch'i and Ch\u00fc streams it enters the Yellow river. Tracing the course of the Lo from 'Bear's-ear' hill, on the north-east it unites with the Chien and Ch'an, further to the east it unites with the I, and to the north-east enters the Yellow river. So through-\nout the nine provinces a similar order was effected: \"the four coasts were built over, the hills were cleared of their wood and sacrificed to, the streams had their sources scoured out, the marshes were well banked, and all within the four seas had access to the capital. The six treasuries of nature\\(^1\\) were made the most of, and the various parts of the country exactly compared so that the receipt of revenue could be carefully adjusted according to their resources. The three characters of the soil were classified, and the taxation fixed. The central government conferred lands and surnames. Revenue was paid to the Emperor's exalted virtue, which was set up as an example, and none opposed his Majesty's action.\" Now beyond the Emperor's capital \"500 li constituted the Imperial domain. From the first hundred li they brought, as revenue, the whole plant of the grain, from the second the ears, from the third the straw, but the people had to perform feudal services, from the fourth the grain in the husk, and from the fifth the grain cleaned. Five hundred li beyond the Imperial domain constituted the domain of the nobles. The first hundred li formed the allotments to the feudal nobles, the second hundred those to the people employed by the State, and the other 300 those to the various princes. Five hundred li beyond the nobles' domain lay the peaceful domain. In the first 300 li they cultivated learning and the moral duties, and in the other 200 their energies lay in the direction of war and defence. Five hundred li beyond the peaceful domain was the domain of restraint. The first 300 were occupied by the I tribes, and the other 200 by criminals undergoing the lesser banishment. Five hundred li beyond the domain of restraint lay the wild domain. Three hundred li were occupied by the Man tribes, and the other 200 li by criminals undergoing the greater banishment. On the east reaching to the sea, on the west extending to the rolling sands, to the utmost\n\n\\(^1\\) K'ung-an-kuo states that the six treasuries of nature were water, fire, metal, wood, earth, and grain.\nlimits of the north and south, Y\u00fc\u2019s fame and influence spread everywhere within the four seas, so the Emperor presented him with a dark-coloured sceptre, thus announcing to the empire the completion of his work.\u201d\n\nThe empire then being at peace and well governed, Kaoyao was made chief minister of state with a view to his ruling the people. The emperor Shun gave audience to Y\u00fc, Poyi, and Kaoyao, who addressed each other before the Emperor.1 \u201cKaoyao, setting forth his counsels, said, \u2018If a man sincerely follows the path of duty and virtue, his counsellors will be intelligent, and those who aid him will act in harmony.\u2019 Y\u00fc said, \u2018Yes, but what do you mean?\u2019 Kaoyao said, \u2018Oh! he will be careful about his personal cultivation, and will think constantly about it. Thus he will pay due regard to precedence among the nine branches of his kindred, all the intelligent will exert themselves in his service, and so from what is at hand he may attain to what is far off.\u2019 Y\u00fc made obeisance at these excellent words, and said, \u2018It is so.\u2019 Kaoyao said, \u2018Oh! it all lies in knowing mankind, and in quieting the people.\u2019 Y\u00fc said, \u2018Alas! to attain to all this would be difficult even for the Emperor. He who knows men is wise; he who can put men into the posts for which they are fit, and can quiet the people, is benevolent, and the black-haired race will cherish him in their hearts. When a man can be thus wise and kind, why should he have anxiety about a Huantow? why to be removing a chief of the Miao tribes? why should he fear a man of specious words, good appearance, and artful ways?\u2019 Kaoyao said, \u2018Just so! there are in all nine virtues, and when we say that a man possesses these virtues it is as much as to say that he begins to do such and such things. They are liberality combined with dignity, mildness combined with firmness, bluntness combined with respect, aptness for government combined with caution, docility combined with\n\n---\n\n1 Most of the \u2018Counsels of Kaoyao\u2019 is here transcribed, a few sentences near the close only being omitted. The historian never intimates in any of his extracts that he is drawing largely from the Book of History.\nboldness, straightforwardness combined with gentleness, easy negligence combined with discrimination, resolution combined with sincerity, and courage combined with justice. If these are apparent, and that continuously, how fortunate it will be. He who daily displays three of these virtues could early and late support and educate a family. He who is strict and reverent in cultivating six of these virtues could brilliantly conduct the affairs of the State. When such men are received and found everywhere, the possessors of those nine virtues will all be employed, and men of eminence will hold office, and the various officers will be respectful and diligent, not teaching heretical, vicious, or strange doctrines. If such men and such officers do not exist it may be said that the affairs of Heaven are in confusion. Heaven punishes the guilty, and the five punishments can be severally applied for that purpose. Are my words sound, and can they be put in force?' Y\u00fc said, 'Your words are perfect, and can be successfully put in force.' Kaoyao said, 'As to that I do not know, but I aim at assisting in the path of duty.'\n\n\"The Emperor Shun said to Y\u00fc, 'Will you, too, make a brilliant speech?' Y\u00fc did obeisance and said, 'Ah! what can I say? I aim at being assiduous from day to day.' Kaoyao, teasing Y\u00fc, said, 'What do you mean by being assiduous?' Y\u00fc said, 'When the flood assailed the heavens, and in its vast expanse encompassed the mountains and overtopped the hills, so that the common people were overcome by the water, I travelled on dry land in a carriage, went about on the water in a boat, in miry places I used a sledge, while in going over the hills I used spikes. All along the hills I hewed paths through the woods, and together with Yi supplied the people with paddy and fresh meat. In order to drain the nine streams into the four seas, I deepened the channels and canals, and connected them with the rivers, and together with\n\n1 Here follows nearly the whole of the 'Yi and Chi' chapter of the Book of History.\n'Millet' and the people in general when it was difficult to obtain food, and when food was scarce I bartered the surplus stock to make up for deficiencies, and removed the stores. Thus the people were quieted, and the various states properly governed.' Kaoyao said, 'Yes! this was good on your part.' Y\u00fc said, 'Ah! your Majesty, carefully maintain the Throne which you occupy, and be quiet in your behaviour, assist virtue, and the nation will grandly respond to your pure desires. It will thus be manifest that you await the decrees of the Supreme Being, and will not Heaven renew its favouring appointment by conferring blessings on you?' The Emperor said, 'Dear me! ministers! ministers! you constitute my legs and arms, my ears and eyes. If I wish to aid and support the people, you help me to do so. If I wish to see the emblematic figures of the ancients\u2014the sun, moon, and stars\u2014which are embroidered on the robes and coloured silks, you see them clearly for me. If I wish to hear the six pitchpipes, the five notes, and the eight musical instruments on the adjustment of which depend good government or misrule, and the consequent rise or decline of the five duties, you hear them for me. If I do wrong, you have to correct me. Do not flatter me to my face and speak evil of me behind my back. Be reverent, ye four ministers, and all ye calumniating minions of officials. If the prince's virtue is honestly displayed all men will be pure.' Y\u00fc said, 'Yes! should your Majesty not act thus, but equally employ the good and bad, you will gain no credit.' The Emperor said, 'Do not be arrogant like Chu of Tan, who took his pleasure only in idleness and dissipation. He would make boats go where there was no water, introduced licentious friends into his family, and thereby cut off the hereditary honours of his house. I could not follow that line of conduct.' Y\u00fc said, 'I was married at T'ushan on the days hain and j\u00ean, and on the days kuei and chia my son Ch'i was born. I did not treat him as a son, and therefore was able to complete my labours on the water and on land. I assisted in com-\npleting the five Tenures, extending over 5000 li. In the provinces I appointed twelve tutors, and in the regions beyond to the four seas I established five presidents. These all did their duty, and achieved great results, but the Miao tribes were obstinate, and refused to do their work. Think of this, your Majesty.' The Emperor said, 'That my virtue is the guide is the result of your orderly arrangements.' Kaoyao therefore, respecting Y\u00fc's virtues,\" bade the people carry out as a rule his plan of preferring admonition, but \"also made use of punishments.\" Shun's virtues were very clear, whereupon \"K'uei played some music; the spirits of Imperial ancestors, and hosts of nobles gave place to one another, and even birds and beasts wheeled about and danced. When the nine airs of Shun's music were played, the ph\u0153nixes came and put themselves in attitudes, the different beasts led each other on to dance, and the various officials were really in harmony. The Emperor upon this composed the following ode, 'Being set on high by the favouring appointment of Heaven, we must be careful at every moment, and in every particular.' He then sang as follows, 'When the members are happy, the head is exalted, and the various kinds of work are happily performed.' Kaoyao did obeisance with his head to his hands, and then to the ground, and with a loud voice said, 'Oh! think. It is yours to lead on and originate affairs. Pay careful attention to your laws. Be cautious.' He continued his song, saying, 'When the head is intelligent, the members are good, and all business will prosper.'\" Shun \"again sang as follows, 'When the head is vexatious, the members are idle, and all business is ruined.' The Emperor bowed and said, 'Yes, go and be reverent!'\"\n\nThe whole nation upon this applauded Y\u00fc's brilliant musical performance, and the divine lord of hills and streams, \u00b9 \"the Emperor Shun presented Y\u00fc to Heaven\n\n\u00b9 This passage is found in Mencius (Bk. V. pt. 1, vi.), where, however, the name of Shun's son is not mentioned. There are, too, some discrepancies. Mencius has it that after Yi had been \"presented to Heaven by Y\u00fc, seven\nas his heir, and 17 years afterwards the Emperor Shun died. The three years' mourning being over, Y\u00fc retired before Shun's son Shangch\u00fcn to the town of Yang,\" but the princes of the empire all left Shangch\u00fcn, and went to Y\u00fc's court, and Y\u00fc accordingly occupied the Imperial throne. Facing the south he gave audience to the nation. His dynastic appellation was (Hsia hou) Prince of Hsia; and his surname Ssu. The Emperor Y\u00fc sat on the throne, and recommended Kaoyao for promotion, transferring also the administration of affairs to him, but Kaoyao died, and his descendants were enfeoffed with the principalities of Yingliu and Hs\u00fc. The prince then recommended Yi for the appointment of administrator of affairs. Ten years elapsed, when the Emperor Y\u00fc, having gone to the east on a tour of inspection, died at Huich'i, and the rule of the empire was given to Yi. \"When the three years' mourning was over, Yi\" resigned in favour of Y\u00fc's son Ch'i, and \"retired to the south of Mount Chi.\" Yu's son Ch'i was worthy, and the nation fixed its desires upon him, but when Y\u00fc died, although the rule was given to Yi, he supported Y\u00fc but a few days, when the nation not being content \"the princes all left Yi, and went to Ch'i's court saying, 'He is the son of our sovereign'\" emperor Y\u00fc.\n\nCh'i then succeeded to the Imperial throne, and became Emperor Ch'i, the Prince of Hsia. The Prince of Hsia, Emperor Ch'i, was the son of Y\u00fc, his mother being the daughter of the lord of T'ushan. As the lord of Hu would not submit, Ch'i attacked him, and \u00b9 \"there was a great battle at Kan.\"\n\n\u00b9 Here follows a transcript of the whole of the 'Speech at Kan.' Dr. Legge observes in the concluding note to his translation of the chapter that the account is a clumsy imitation of Y\u00fc's expedition against the Sanmiao tribes in the 'Counsels of the Great Y\u00fc,' but there are so many imitations and repetitions in the Records that one soon tires of noticing them, and can but suppose that the historian's inventive faculty was faulty.\nJust before the engagement the \"speech at Kan\" was delivered to the \"six generals, who were summoned together; Ch'i said, 'Ah! ye who are engaged in my six armies, I have a solemn announcement to make to you. The chief of Hu violently sets at naught the five human relations, and idly casts aside the three obligations of duty. Heaven will on this account oppose him and cut off the span of his life, and I am now but reverently executing the punishment appointed by Heaven. If you on the left do not do your work on the left, and you on the right do not do your work on the right, it will be a disregard of my orders. If you, charioteers, do not observe the rules for the management of your horses, it will be a disregard of my orders. You who obey my orders shall be rewarded in the ancestral temple, but you who disobey my orders shall be slain before the altar of the spirits of the land, and I will destroy both you and your children.\" He thereupon destroyed the chief of Hu, and the whole nation went to the court of the Prince of Hsia.\n\nEmperor Ch'i died, and his son Emperor T'aik'ang (K'ang the 1st) came to the throne. The Emperor T'aik'ang lost his kingdom; his five brothers waited for him on the north of the Lo river, and composed the song of the five sons.\"\n\nK'ang the 1st died, and his brother K'ang the 2nd came to the throne, that is the Emperor K'ang the 2nd. In the time of the Emperor K'ang the 2nd, \"Hsi and Ho, indulging in wine and dissipation, neglected the seasons, and let the calendar get into confusion. Yin went to punish them, and the 'punitive expedition of Yin' was composed.\"\n\n---\n\n1 From the Preface to the Book of History, para. 7.\n2 The 'Song of the Five Sons,' and the 'Punitive Expedition of Yin' are the names of two other short documents of the Shuching. The calendar getting into confusion is said to refer to a solar eclipse occurring in the fifth year of the reign of the Emperor Chungk'ang or K'ang the 2nd, which, according to the common scheme of chronology, was in the year B.C. 2165, but Professor De Lacouperie gives the rectified date as 1904, while it is 1948 B.C. in the Bamboo annals. The date of the eclipse cannot, however, be satisfactorily verified, and the doubts as to the antiquity of this part of Chinese history are therefore confirmed.\n3 From the Preface to the Book of History, para. 8.\nK'ang the 2nd died, and his son Emperor Hsiang came to the throne.\n\nEmperor Hsiang died, and his son K'ang the 3rd came to the throne.\n\nEmperor K'ang the 3rd died, and his son Emperor Chu came to the throne.\n\nEmperor Chu died, and his son Emperor Huai came to the throne.\n\nEmperor Huai died, and his son Emperor Mang came to the throne.\n\nEmperor Mang died, and his son Emperor Hsieh came to the throne.\n\nEmperor Hsieh died, and his son Emperor Puhsiang came to the throne.\n\nEmperor Puhsiang died, and his brother Emperor Chiung came to the throne.\n\nEmperor Chiung died, and his son Emperor Chin came to the throne.\n\nEmperor Chin died, and Emperor Puhsiang's son K'ungchia, that is Emperor K'ungchia, came to the throne. Emperor K'ungchia was fond of enquiring into spiritual matters, and indulged in dissipation, and the virtue of the princes of Hsia having degenerated, the chiefs rebelled. Heaven sent down two dragons, a male and a female. K'ungchia could not feed them, and could not obtain a dragon-keeper. After the decline of T'aot'ang (Yao) one of his descendants, Liu lei, learnt to train dragons, and he was chosen out of the dragon-keepers to wait on K'ungchia, who gave him the title of dragon-tamer, which was inherited by the descendants of the Shiwei.\u00b9 The female dragon died, and he served it up\n\n\u00b9 These characters, which mean 'pig-sty,' may be used derogatorily for the Shiwei tribes, which were to the east, west, north, and south of Turphan. One of the eighteen tribes joining Yelutache in 1126 A.D. was called the Great Yellow Shiwei (see Situation de Holin en Tartarie. T'oungpao, vol. iv. p. 76). In Plath's Mandchurie, p. 80, we find that 'the Shiwei lived to the north of the Amur and of the Moho, and 3000 li from the Khitan country. You cross the river Cho, pass the mountain Toutseu, which\nas a meal for the Prince of Hsia, but the latter having sent some one to look for it, he became frightened and ran away.\n\nK'ungchia died, and his son Emperor Kao came to the throne.\n\nEmperor Kao died, and his son Emperor Fa came to the throne.\n\nEmperor Fa died, and his son Emperor Li Kuei,\\(^1\\) that is Chieh, came to the throne.\n\n\\(^{1}\\) Li or Chieh Kuei is the 17th and last emperor of the Hsia dynasty, which the 'General Mirror of History' shows us lasted 439 years, but with the exception of K'ungchia and the last emperor, where some few details of character are given, our historian merely gives the names of the last fourteen without any record of events or length of reigns whatever. This is the more surprising when, according to Dr. Legge, \"the documents of the Shuching which follow the Tribute of Y\u00fc, commencing with the speech at Kan, delivered in B.C. 2197 by Y\u00fc's son and successor, may all be received as veritable monuments of antiquity, and are contemporaneous with the events which they relate.\"\n\nThe meanings of the names of the emperors are worth noting, for it will then be seen how many are connected with astronomy or the calendar\u2014a very pregnant fact. They are as follows:\n\n(1) The great Y\u00fc or Hsia how. Kung y\u00fc and Hsia how were the names of two scholars contemporary with Ssuma Ch'ien. The characters used for writing Kung y\u00fc are the same as those for 'Tribute of Y\u00fc,' but reversed.\n\n(2) Chi or Ch'i ming = opening brightness, is the name for the planet Venus, so called because it 'opens the brightness' of the day (L. C. IV. 2, v. 9).\n\n(3) T'auk'ang, or K'ang the 1st, literally 'great peace,' but \u5eb7 is used for \u5149 the second of the twenty-eight asterisms, answering to \\(\\lambda.\\alpha.\\mu.\\) in Virgo constellation.\n\n(4) Chung K'ang or K'ang the 2nd.\n\n(5) Hsiang, the 'Counsellor,' is the name of a single red star, answering to seventy-three of Flamsteed between \\(8\\) and \\(9\\) of the Great Bear (Schlegel, p. 528). The interregnum of forty years during this reign referred to in different schemes of chronology is not referred to by our historian.\n\n(6) Shao K'ang = K'ang the lesser, or K'ang the 3rd.\n\n(7) There seems an uncertainty as to the right character to be used for the Emperor Chu's name. Ssuma gives first \u865a, which means the space between the throne and the Emperor's retiring room behind it, and then \u5b50 which means 'I.' The 'General Mirror of History' gives \u6893, which means a shuttle. It is likely that \u865a, which means a lance, and the star \\(8\\) in Bootes, is the one which should be used.\nReign of the Emperor Chieh. Ever since the time of K'ungchia the barons had frequently rebelled. Chieh of Hsia did not strive after virtue, and the wars injured the people. Unable to endure their wrongs they summoned T'ang to their aid, but he was imprisoned in the tower of Hsia; being afterwards released. T'ang cultivated virtue, and the princes all went over to him, so T'ang led an army to attack Chieh of Hsia. Chieh fled to Mingtiao, and was eventually driven out and slain. Chieh observed to someone, 'I regret that I did not take the opportunity of killing T'ang in the tower of Hsia, and then I should not have been brought to such a pass.' T'ang, being seated on the Imperial throne, superseded Hsia, and gave audience to the people. T'ang enfeoffed the descendants of the Hsias. Until the time of the Chow dynasty they held the principality of Chi.\n\n(8) Huai = the Sophora Japonica tree; also the essence of the asterism \u865a tumulus composed of \u03b1 in Equuleus and \u03b2 in Aquarius.\n(9) Mang = bearded grain, a solar term falling about the 6th June.\n(10) Hsieh = ooze out. Read 'I' = a tributary of the Huai river.\n(11) Pu-hsiang = no surrender. Hsiang lou (\u964d\u58d8) is a star in Aries.\n(12) Chiung = a door-bar.\n(13) Chin = a hovel.\n(14) K'ung chia = Cave A. Chia is a cyclical character, and the first of the 'Ten stems,' and being used in notation may be said to be equal to 1, or A.\n(15) Kao or Hao = vast, glorious. Great Hao is the name for the first moon, as Small Hao is for the ninth moon.\n(16) Fa = to shoot; spring.\n(17) Li Kuei, or Chieh Kuei. Li = a shoe, and Chieh = cruel. Kuei is the last of the 'Ten stems' and therefore equivalent to the letter 10 or J.\n\nThus most of the names of the Emperors of this dynasty seem to be connected with astronomical or calendaric signs, and this fact will be more evident in the case of the names of the emperors in the succeeding dynasty of Shang.\n\n(To be continued.)\nART. IV.\u2014Kami Vocabularies. By Bernard Houghton, M.R.A.S.\n\nThe remarkable divergences and alterations which a very slight difference in locality causes to exist in the tongues of the Tibeto-Burman hill-tribes have been frequently adverted to, and are, in fact, one of the stock examples of the birth and growth of dialectic change in language. In truth, it must be admitted that in no part of the world are the conditions more favourable to such growth than in the mass of mountains which extends from the Himalayas to Cape Negrais, and which forms the habitat of many of the most interesting of these tribes. Favoured by an abnormally heavy rainfall, the dense jungles which everywhere cover these hills would successfully defy the efforts of even civilized people for their destruction. As it is, except for temporary clearings for cultivation, and somewhat more permanent ones immediately round the villages, these forests remain practically intact, forming, together with the extraordinarily broken character of the ground, one of the most powerful obstacles conceivable to intercourse between the various villages. Such intercourse, therefore, except when it partakes of a raid or foray, is usually on a very limited scale; nor, as a matter of fact, was anything more extended desired by the villagers until quite recently. As McCabe says of the Nagas: \"They have remained isolated on their hill-tops, only deigning to visit their immediate neighbours when a longing for their heads has become too strong to be resisted.\" Trade and commerce being practically unknown, and their political system, if it may be so called, being essentially clannish and unfavourable to the development of a strong central\npower, the condition of affairs has been as favourable as possible to dialectic generation. Added to this, it should be noted as amongst most untutored and barbarous people, their words are not articulated so distinctly and incisively as with educated persons, whilst the low tone of voice habitual to those living in the forests, and the inherited tendency to clip their words and towards laziness of pronunciation, which prevails amongst most tribes of the Tibeto-Burman stock, have all contributed to prevent anything fixed or stable in the different dialects. Small wonder, then, that the varieties of speech should be so great in these regions, or that the few Europeans who have produced vocabularies and dialects of the languages of these tribes should all have found it necessary to caution their readers against supposing that the forms and words found therein should have acceptance over any large tract of country. All that can be done in such a case is to learn the dialect prevailing in the most important and thickly populated part of the tribal country, and when going elsewhere to use with caution all except the commoner words and phrases in it.\n\nIt follows, therefore, *a fortiori*, that whilst brief vocabularies of the languages of these people enable us to determine roughly their ethnical position, (so far as the latter can be said to depend on philological evidence,) a much fuller and more careful study is necessary before we can be in a position to determine exactly their linguistic position, and, to some extent, the influences to which they have been subjected in their past history. The result of the collection of different forms which the same word takes in the tribal speech would, as a general rule, be to strengthen carefully made comparisons such as those of B. H. Hodgson, but the fact of the existence of this extraordinary state of flux, (so to speak,) in these languages should warn us against too rash comparisons, if such a warning were needed, which ought not to be the case.\n\nThe subjoined vocabularies of the Kami or Khami language will show to some extent the difficulty, or rather\nthe impossibility, of accepting any one as the standard form of such languages as this. They will, however, be chiefly interesting in throwing some light on the phonological changes which take place in this family, as we have here to compare not the words of widely separated tribes of doubtful relationship, but those of people living in neighbouring villages, and calling themselves by one name. From the permutations which have thus admittedly taken place in the same language, it may be possible to argue with more certainty on those used by different tribes now widely sundered from each other. The comparative philology of these languages is, in fact, in still so elementary a state that no further apology is, I think, needed for the presentation of what would ordinarily be a surplus de richesses in the words of one language.\n\nThe first of these vocabularies has been procured by Maung Hla Paw Zan, an Extra-Assistant Commissioner in the Akyab district, (under the orders of A. M. B. Irwin, Deputy Commissioner). The words were not altogether taken down according to the accepted system of transliteration, but no difficulty has been experienced in effecting the necessary alterations. The internal evidence shows that on the whole this list has been carefully made, whilst it is the best preserved Kami of the four, i.e. the words show comparatively few changes induced by laziness of speech, etc.\n\nThe second was made by Mg. Tha Bwin, Myook of Sandoway, whilst I was there, the words being taken from a Kami youth from the Akyab district. Mg. Tha Bwin is a very intelligent specimen of the subordinate Civil Service of Burma, and I am inclined, considering his aptitude for taking down words correctly, to regard this list as the most correctly taken down of the four, though the words show more traces of dialectic degeneration than those in the first one. (This list is marked T.-B.) A considerable additional number of words, collected by Mg. Tha Bwin, beyond those required for purposes of comparison, are inserted at the end, as they are all words in common use, and no extended vocabulary of Kami has yet been published.\nThe third and fourth lists are taken from the essay \"On the Indo-Chinese Borderers,\" by Brian Houghton Hodgson, being furnished to him by the late Sir Arthur (then Captain) Phayre. The latter one is called \"K\u00fami,\" and it is stated that the K\u00famis are divided into two divisions\u2014Kami or Kimi and K\u00fami, called by the Arakanese Awa\u00b9 K\u00fami and Aphya K\u00fami. There would seem to be some mistake about this division, which is not mentioned in the Census Reports, nor in recent accounts of the Hill Tracts of Arakan; nor have I, when in Arakan, been able to hear of any such people as the K\u00famis. The Burmese, who have a happy knack in giving nicknames, have metamorphosed Kami into k'we-myi = dog's-tail, and by this name the tribe is widely known in Arakan and Burma. It is probable that \"K\u00fami\" is a mere corruption of this latter word. The internal evidence also in the vocabularies would show that the second, or \"K\u00fami\" list, is practically the same as the first, or Kami one, with certain differences due apparently to Chin and Mro influence. I have, therefore, merely alluded to the first list as P. 1 and the second as P. 2, being convinced that no real subdivision, such as \"K\u00fami,\" exists in the tribe. In the last Census Report the latter are put down as numbering 14,126 souls within the limits of Burma properly speaking. It is probable that this number is, owing to defective enumeration, somewhat under the mark.\n\nFrom a philological point of view, the Kamis fall under the Chin-Lushai group of the Tibeto-Burman family. From the vocabulary made by Mg. Tha Bwin, it will be seen that the language possesses at least two tones,\u00b2 corresponding to those in Burmese, and it is possible that the rising tone also exists in it. Although the gutturals \u03c7 and \u03b3 occur, as well as the labio-dental f (the latter rarely), words can only end in a vowel, a nasal, or the consonants k and t,\u2014p, l, and s, though still final in Lushai, being not now so in Kami. The\n\n\u00b9 Awa means the mouth of a river, aphya its source.\n\u00b2 The light tone is represented in the lists by the figure 1 and the heavy one by 2.\n\"spiritus lenis\" is met with (rarely) at the end of words, as is also the case in Lushai and S. Chin, and similarly to the latter language we find the indistinct initial nasal \\( m' \\). The chief phonetic rules observed in comparing the different lists are well known to obtain in the different languages of this branch of the Tibeto-Burman family. They are as follows:\n\nThe serviles \\( ka, ga, ta, \\) and \\( a \\) are interchangeable, as are also \\( ma, m, pa, ba, p \\). \\( A \\) and \\( a \\) (serviles) are frequently dropped, and serve, I believe, mainly to facilitate the enunciation of the initial letter. The consonants \\( k', x, \\) and \\( h \\) are often interchanged, the last two being, in fact, merely softenings of the first, whilst the semi-vowels \\( y \\) and \\( w \\), whether initial or following a consonant, are easily weakened into \\( i \\) and \\( e \\) or \\( u \\) and \\( o \\) respectively. The nasals \\( n, n, \\) and \\( m \\) interchange when final, but as regards \\( m \\), at any rate, not when initial.\n| English | Kami | Remarks |\n|---------|------|---------|\n| Air     | kali; (T.-B.) l\u0113; (P. 1) ga-l\u012b; (P. 2) ali | There are, of course, several different kinds.

V.\u2014On the Stress-Accent in the Modern Indo-Aryan Vernaculars. By G. A. Grierson, Ph.D., C.I.E.\n\n[The following contractions have been used in this article:\u2014IAVs. = Modern Indo-Aryan Vernaculars; Skr., Sanskrit; Pr., Prakrit; Ap., Apabhra\u1e43\u1e63a; M., Mar\u0101\u1e6dhi; G., Gujar\u0101\u1e6di; H., Hindi; B., Bih\u0101r\u012b; Bg., Bang\u0101l\u012b; P., Pa\u00f1j\u0101b\u012b; S., Sindh\u012b; Ts., Tatsama; sTs., Semi-Tatsama; Tbh., Tadkhava; ZDMG., Zeitschrift der deutschen Morgenl\u00e4ndischen Gesellschaft; H.C., H\u0113ma-candra\u2019s Prakrit Grammar.]\n\nThe IAVs. closely follow the rules of the Sanskrit stress-accent (as distinct from the ancient musical accent) which have been noted by Prof. Jacobi in ZDMG. xlvii. 574 and ff. The only difference is that the IAVs. do not usually throw the accent further back than the antepenultimate if the word ends in a long syllable. The general rules are as follows:\n\n(1) The stress-accent falls on the penultimate if it be long. Examples\u2014Skr. and Ts. k\u012brti \u2018fame\u2019; G. jan\u014di \u2018a sacrificial thread\u2019; M. g\u012bdh(a) \u2018a vulture\u2019; k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da \u2018one-eyed\u2019; S. rah\u0101\u1e0du \u2018a dweller\u2019; H. ast\u012bjh\u0101 \u2018invisible\u2019; k\u012bs\u0101n(a) \u2018a husbandman\u2019; B. chot\u0101kk\u0101 \u2018small.\u2019\n\n(2) If the penultimate be short, the accent falls on the antepenultimate, provided that be long. Examples\u2014Skr. and Ts. k\u012brtan(a) \u2018a report\u2019; M. v\u0101lan(a) \u2018inclination,\u2019 k\u0101par(a) \u2018clothes\u2019; H. b\u0101ndhan(a) \u2018binding.\u2019\n\n(3) In any other case it is thrown back as far as possible\u2014the limits being, in Sanskrit and Ts., and in IAV. words ending in a short vowel, the last syllable but three; and in IAV. words ending in a long vowel, the antepenultimate. Examples\u2014Skr. k\u016b\u1e6dilat\u0101 \u2018deceitfulness,\u2019 as a Ts. k\u016b\u1e6dil\u2019t\u0101; M. k\u0101r\u2019vat(a) \u2018a saw\u2019; sTs. p\u0101r\u2019bat(a) \u2018a mountain\u2019; B. p\u0101r\u2019at(a) \u2018touching\u2019; H. tin\u2019k\u0101 \u2018a straw,\u2019 b\u0101l(a) \u2018force\u2019: but H. pah\u016bc\u2019n\u0101 (not p\u0101h\u016bc\u2019n\u0101) \u2018to arrive\u2019; H. nik\u0101l\u2019t\u0101 \u2018issuing.\u2019\nSometimes, however, even an IAV. word, which has the accent on the antepenultimate, may retain the accent on the same syllable, when it becomes the last syllable but three by the addition of a secondary suffix. This is by no means universal; pronunciation varying with different people. Thus, H. tit\u0101li \u2018a butterfly,\u2019 long form, properly, tit\u0101liya, but also sometimes tit\u0101liya.\n\n(4) If the accent does not fall on the first syllable of a word, that syllable has a secondary accent.

In the IAVs. the process is still carried on, but the neutral vowel is substituted for a, i, or u, instead of that vowel being altogether elided. Thus, M. k\u0101r\u2019vat \u2018a saw\u2019; S. big\u0101\u1e0d\u2019nu \u2018to be spoiled\u2019; B. gh\u014dr\u2019v\u0101 \u2018a horse\u2019; Skr. d\u016brb\u0101lakah \u2018weak,\u2019 Pr. d\u016bbbal\u0101o, H. d\u016bb\u2019la.\u00b9\n\nThe elision of i and u is more rare in the IAVs., and is restricted to special cases.\n\nExamples are\u2014\n\n| Skr. bh\u0101gini \u2018sister\u2019 | Pr. b\u0101hi\u1e47i | H. b\u0101hi\u2019ni, b\u0101han, or b\u0101hin.

They are really compounds of the past participle [d\u0113khal(a)], and old forms of the V ah \u2018to be,\u2019 \u0101h\u016b meaning \u2018I am,\u2019 and so on.\n\nThe tendency to drop the final vowel of the first member of the compound [as in d\u0113khal(a)+\u0101h\u016b] dates from the earliest times. Thus, Skr. kumbha-k\u0101ra\u1e25 \u2018a potter\u2019; Pr. kumbha-\u0101r\u014d or kumbh\u0101r\u014d (against the usual custom, H.C. i. 8), IAV. kumh\u0101r(a); Skr. n\u0101vam\u0101lika \u2018jasmine\u2019; Pr. *n\u0101vm\u0101li\u0101, *n\u0101vum\u0101li\u0101, n\u014dm\u0101li\u0101; Skr. pr\u0101tiv\u0113\u1e63ah, Pr. p\u0101\u0113s\u014d or p\u0101di\u0113s\u014d, H. pad\u014ds(a). A long vowel in such a position is first shortened and then elided: thus, Skr. dv\u0101catv\u0101r\u012b\u1e41\u1e63at; Pr. *b\u0101y\u0101y\u0101l\u012bsami, b\u0101y\u0101l\u012bs\u0101m; H. by\u0101l\u012bs(a).\n(7) If the accent falls on a short vowel there is a tendency to lengthen it; thus, Skr. \u0101pag\u0101 or \u0101pag\u0101 'a river'; m\u016bsala or m\u016bsala 'a club'; so also\u2014\n\npr\u0101tipad 'first day of' | p\u00e1divay\u0101 or | M. p\u0101\u1e0d\u2019v\u0101, but H.  \na fortnight | p\u00e1\u1e0divay\u0101 | p\u00e1\u1e0dib\u0101, B. p\u0101rab.  \nh\u0101stini 'she elephant' | h\u0101\u1e6dhini | M. (with change of  \naccents) hatt\u012bn, but  \nH. etc. h\u0101\u1e6dh\u2019nt.\n\n(8) On the other hand the accent has a tendency to shorten a preceding long vowel; e.g. Skr. ag\u0101ra\u1e41 or ag\u0101ra\u1e41 'a house'; Skr. atik\u016bpya\u1e25 or ak\u016bpya (for aiik\u016bpya) 'very base'; so in IAV.\u2014\n\nk\u0101\u015b\u012bs\u0101m 'green vitriol' | k\u0101\u015b\u012bs\u0101m | H. k\u0101\u015b\u012bs.  \n\u0101dh\u012bnah 'dependent on' | sTs. adh\u012bn.  \nd\u0113v\u0101laya\u1e25 'temple' | d\u0113v\u0101la\u014d | P. dev\u0101l\u0101.\n\nSo M. bh\u012bk(a) 'begging,' bhik\u0101ri, G. bhikh\u0101ri 'a beggar'; M. k\u0101ma(a) 'work,' kam\u0101\u016b 'that which earns.' Again, Skr. gen. kar\u1e47\u0101ya 'of an ear'; Pr. dat. kar\u1e47\u0101ssa or kar\u1e47\u0101sa 'to an ear'; M. k\u0101na\u015b(a) (\u0915\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0938) 'to an ear,' in which the first a is written long, but is pronounced short like the a in the Italian ballo. So also M. bh\u012bk(a), dat. bhik\u0101\u015b(a); pik(a) 'a ripe crop,' dat. pik\u0101\u015b(a); h\u0101t(a) 'a hand,' dat. h\u0101t\u0101\u015b(a) as in k\u0101na\u015b(a).\n\n(9) When a word begins with two long syllables, the second of which has the stress-accent, the secondary accent on the first syllable often attracts the first accent to itself, and the syllable which would ordinarily bear the stress-accent is shortened. Thus, Skr. \u0101\u1e47\u012bta becomes in Pr. \u0101\u1e47ia, Skr. p\u0101\u1e47\u012bya, Pr. p\u0101\u1e47iya, and so on. So\u2014\n\nd\u0113v\u0101laya\u1e25 'temple' | H. d\u0113val, M. d\u0113val.  \nk\u0101y\u0101sthah 'a man of the writer caste' | k\u0101y\u0101ttth\u014d | B. k\u0101yath.  \nc\u0101t\u0101la\u1e25 'mad' | c\u0101l\u014d | M. b\u0101val\u0101, B. b\u0101v\u1e5b\u1e0d,  \nS. b\u0101v\u012br\u014d.\n(10) This even happens when the first syllable is short; e.g. Skr. *\u0101t\u012bka* \u2018false,\u2019 Pr. *\u0101liya*; Skr. *m\u0101dh\u0101ka* \u2018name of a tree,\u2019 Pr. *m\u0101hwa*; so\u2014\n\n| \u015br\u012b\u015ba\u1e25 \u2018a kind of tree\u2019 | \u015br\u012bs\u014d | H. siris. |\n|------------------------|-------|-----------|\n| d\u016btiyaka\u1e25 \u2018second\u2019     | d\u016btiya\u014d | H. d\u016btiy\u0101. |\n| g\u0101bh\u012braka\u1e25 \u2018deep\u2019      | g\u0101hira\u014d | H. g\u0101hir\u0101. |\n| b\u0101livardah \u2018a bullock\u2019 | b\u0101ll\u014d | IAV. b\u0101l or b\u0101il. |\n\n(11) In Sanskrit and Prakrit there was also a secondary accent on the penultimate of a word. Thus, in *k\u016btil\u0101ta* the *a* in the penultimate has more accent than the *i* in the antepenultimate. Sometimes this secondary accent was so strongly felt that it swallowed up the main stress-accent, and itself became the main accent, with the usual result of lengthening the accented syllable. Thus, while on the one hand we have *j\u0101lp\u0101ka* \u2018talkative,\u2019 *p\u0101rvat\u012bka*\u00b9 \u2018a range of mountains,\u2019 we have also *j\u0101lp\u0101ka*, *p\u0101rvat\u012bya*, or *p\u0101rvat\u0113ya* \u2018a mountaineer\u2019: so also we have *r\u0101th\u0101ka*, or *r\u0101th\u012bna* \u2018possessing a chariot,\u2019 and *gr\u0101mika* \u2018a villager,\u2019 but also *gr\u0101miya*, *gr\u0101m\u0113ya*, and *gr\u0101m\u012b\u1e47a*; *d\u0113vik\u0101* \u2018a goddess,\u2019 and *d\u0113v\u012bka* \u2018a queen\u2019; *d\u0113\u1e6dika* and *d\u0113\u1e6diya* \u2018native\u2019; *sa\u016bkhika* and *sa\u016bkh\u012bya* \u2018pertaining to enjoyment\u2019; *c\u0101rt\u012bra* or *c\u0101rt\u012bra* \u2018a quail\u2019; *n\u0101k\u1e63\u016b\u1e6driya* \u2018belong to an asterism,\u2019 but *n\u0101gar\u012bya* \u2018belonging to a town\u2019; *k\u0101rira* and *k\u0101r\u012bra* \u2018the shoot of a bamboo.\u2019 Again, *v\u0101tula*, or *v\u0101\u1e6d\u016bla* \u2018inflated\u2019; *\u016bl\u016bpin*, or *\u016bl\u0101pin* \u2018a guinea-pig\u2019; *v\u0101r\u1e63\u016bka* \u2018rainy,\u2019 but *v\u0101vad\u016bka* \u2018loquacious\u2019; *j\u0101gar\u0101ka*, but *j\u0101gar\u016bka*, not *j\u0101garuka* \u2018waking.\u2019\n\nIn Pr. this is specially common in certain pleonastic terminations. One is -la or -lla. Thus, *vij\u016bla* \u2018lightning,\u2019 *p\u0101tt\u0101lam* \u2018a leaf,\u2019 *pi\u1e0d\u0101lam* \u2018yellow\u2019; but *p\u0101llacilla* \u2018a shoot,\u2019 *m\u016bh\u016bla* \u2018a face,\u2019 *h\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u016bla* \u2018a hand.\u2019 So Skr. *d\u0113vak\u016blam*, Pr. *d\u0113ll\u0101m*; Skr. *s\u0101rv\u0101\u1e6dah*, Pr. *s\u0101vvatt\u014d*; Skr. *\u0113k\u016btas*, Pr. *\u0113katt\u014d*; Skr. *\u0101ny\u0101\u1e6dah*, Pr. *\u0101nnatt\u014d*. So also the suffix *k*:\n\n\u00b9 With reference to many of the following examples, it is hardly necessary to point out the close connection between the terminations *ika* and *iya*.\nthus, Pr. hi\u00e0kam, or (Mg.) h\u00e0d\u00e0kkam \u2018heart.\u2019 According to M\u00e1rkan\u00e7\u00e9ya, xii. 16, the rule is made general in M\u00e1gadh\u00ed Prakrit, in which any vowel before the suffix ka may be lengthened. Thus, Skr. l\u0101v\u00e1nyakah, Mg. Pr. l\u0101v\u00e1nyakek\u0113, or l\u0101v\u00e1nyakek\u0113 \u2018lovely.\u2019\n\nThis second accent on the penultimate reappears in several of the IAVs. The Apabhra\u00f1\u00e7a Prakrit termination -dku becomes (by elision of the k) d\u016b, and then \u00f2 or \u00e0. So the termination ik\u0101 becomes t\u00e0 or iy\u00e0, and thence i. In two Western Vernaculars, i.e. Gujar\u0101ti, and especially Ma-r\u0101th\u012b, curiously enough the M\u00e1gadh\u00ed Prakrit custom has obtained, and this secondary accent has swallowed up the main accent of the word, and becomes itself the main accent, with the usual consequence of shortening the preceding syllable.\u00b9 So that dk\u00fc and ik\u0101 become \u00e1ku, \u00e1u, and \u00edka, t\u00e0, and then \u00e1 or \u00f3, and \u00ed, preceded by a short vowel.

I allude to Dr. B\u00fchler and Sir Raymond West. I do not, at the present stage, feel at liberty to alter what I have written. My statement is based on the words of Dr. Bhandarkar, on p. 117 of the Journal of the Bombay Branch of the R.A.S. vol. xvii. pt. ii. He says: \u201cThere is a rule, which in M. is almost universal, and in G. often observable, in virtue of which the accent, or the whole weight of the sound of a word, falls on the final \u00f2 or \u00f2 of nouns in the former, and the final \u00f2 or \u00f2 in the latter; and the preceding vowels are rendered short, while in the original Sanskrit and Hindi they are long.\u201d He then gives as examples\u2014M. kid\u00e0; M. kh\u00ecja; G. ku\u00f2; M. c\u00ecta; M. cu\u00f2, G. cu\u00f2; M. c\u00f9na, G. c\u00f9no. He gives further examples on p. 141 of the same article. On the point of the question of the correct pronunciation of these two languages, Dr. Bhandarkar\u2019s evidence is entitled to great respect, and further inquiry as to the exact meaning of his words is necessary. Till then I leave my words as they stand, in the hope that, attention having been drawn to the matter, careful inquiry may be made by observers on the spot. In any case, my main argument is not affected. As regards M., Moleworth\u2019s dictionary gives kid and kid\u00e0, ci\u00e0, cu\u00f2, cu\u00f2, cu\u00f2, and c\u00f9na, all of which exactly bear out Dr. Bhandarkar\u2019s remarks.\nMODERN INDO-ARYAN VERNACULARS.\n\n| Skr.          | Ap.

It follows that when a word\nends in a short vowel, that vowel, under the influence of the stress or the secondary accent on the penultimate, has a tendency to disappear.\n\nTaking Tadbhava words first\u2014These come to the IAVs., though the Apabhra\u1e43\u00e7a Prakrit, and nouns pass into the IAVs. in the form of the nominative singular. Nearly every Apabhra\u1e43\u00e7a word, and the nominative of every noun in that language ended in \\(a\\), \\(i\\), or \\(u\\), or in one of these vowels nasalized. If one of these final vowels be preceded by a consonant, under the influence of the accent, it disappears in the modern tongues. Thus\u2014\n\n| Skr. Nom. Sg. | Pr. | Ap. Nom.

Thus\u2014\n\n| Skr. | Ap.

Prakrit has gh\u014d\u1e0do with the final \u1e5b long, Apabhra\u1e43\u00e7a weakens it to \\(u\\), and the IAVs. omit it altogether. There is a tendency in some dialects to preserve the final vowel. It is especially the case in Bg., and in the literary styles of most of the IAVs. This is due to the influence of purists who endeavour to preserve the Skr. pronunciation. In Bang\u0101li and its sister languages, it is also due to other special reasons which need not be discussed here. On the other hand, some languages are fond of shortening and eliding a final long vowel of a Ts.\nThus, in Bih\u0101ri the word for 'woman' is indifferently n\u0101r\u012b (purist), n\u0101ri, or n\u0101r (poetical and vulgar). In Sindh\u012b and K\u0101cm\u012bri the final short vowel of Tadbhavas is preserved, but it is only very faintly pronounced. We meet the process, in fact, at an older stage, and can watch the vowel in the very act of disappearing.\n\nIn Tatsamas the result is the same. The noun is also used in its nominative form, and a final visarga is omitted, as that letter has ceased to exist in the IAVs. We thus get\u2014\n\n| Skr.       | Intermediate Stage. | IAV.         |\n|------------|---------------------|--------------|\n| b\u0101la\u1e25 'strength' | b\u0101la               | b\u0101l or b\u0101la. |\n| m\u0101tih 'mind'   | m\u0101ti                | m\u0101t or m\u0101ti. |\n| v\u0101stuh 'thing' | b\u0101stu               | b\u0101st or b\u0101stu|\n\nThe above remarks only refer to prose pronunciation. In prose these vowels, though they have disappeared, are not elided, for they are still there, and again reappear in poetry, which always preserves the older forms of the language.

VI.\u2014Nejamesha, Naigamesha, Nemeso. By Dr. M. WINTERNITZ.\n\nOne of the sculptures discussed by Dr. B\u00fchler in his highly interesting paper on Specimens of Jaina Sculptures from Mathura (Epigraphia Indica, vol. ii. part xiv. pp. 311 seqq.) bears the perfectly legible inscription bhag\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da Nemeso, \"divine Nemesa.\" Dr. B\u00fchler (l.c. p. 314) refers these words to the goat-headed figure just above them, identifying this Nemesa with Harinegameshi or Naigameshin, a divine being mentioned in Jaina legends as presiding over the procreation of children. In support of this explanation Dr. B\u00fchler refers (p. 316) to \"the occurrence of the Sanskrit words Naigamesha and Nejamesha, which in the Grhyas\u016btras and the medical Samhit\u0101s are the names of a deity with a ram's head, particularly dangerous to children.\" \"There can be no doubt,\" Dr. B\u00fchler adds, \"that the Naigamesha or Nejamesha of the Brahmins, who seizes children and sorely afflicts them with disease, and the son-granting and embryo-exchanging Naigamesha - Naigameshin of the Jainas are in reality identical.\"\n\nNow, though I do not wish to deny a connection between, or even a possible original identity of the two divine beings, Nejamesha and Naigamesha, I may be allowed to point out that there is an essential difference between the Nejamesha as described in Vedic writings, and the Naigamesha of the medical Samhit\u0101s, or the Naigameya of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 I am inclined to think that Naigameya in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata is merely a false reading for Naigamesha, for it is hardly possible to establish an etymological connection between the two forms, and yet it is impossible to separate the two beings. See Petersburg Dictionary, s.v. Naigameya, and B\u00fchler, l.c. p. 316.\nWe meet with Nejamesha for the first time in one of the Khilas of the Rigveda, where we read:\n\n\\[\n\\text{N\u00e9jamesha p\u00e1r\u0101 pata \u015b\u016bputra\u1e25 p\u00fanav \u0101 pata |} \\\\\n\\text{asyai me putr\u0101k\u0101m\u0101yai g\u00e1rbham \u0101 dhehi y\u00e1\u1e25 p\u00faman ||} \\\\\n\\text{y\u00e1they\u00e1m prthiv\u012b mahyutt\u0101n\u0101 g\u00e1rbham \u0101dadh\u00e9 |} \\\\\n\\text{ev\u00e1m t\u00e1m g\u00e1rbham \u0101 dhehi da\u00e7am\u00e9 m\u0101si s\u016btave ||} \\\\\n\\text{Vish\u1e47o\u1e25 4 \u015br\u00e9sthena r\u016bp\u0113\u1e47asy\u0101m n\u0101ry\u0101m gav\u012bny\u0101m |} \\\\\n\\text{p\u00fam\u0101psam putr\u0101m 5 \u0101 dhehi da\u00e7am\u00e9 m\u0101si s\u016btave ||}\n\\]\n\n\u201cO Nejamesha! fly away, and fly hither again bringing a beautiful son; to my wife here who is longing for a son grant thou an embryo, and that a male one.\n\n\u201cJust as this wide Earth here, lying stretched out, conceives the embryo (of plants), so grant thou that embryo which is to be born in the tenth month.\n\n\u201cPlace thou a male child, to be born in the tenth month, into the womb of this woman, (a child endowed) with Vish\u1e47u\u2019s most beautiful form.\u201d\n\nThese three verses seem to be intended here to form one hymn, and Nejamesha seems to be the deity invoked in all the three verses. The Mantras would have to be spoken by a husband desirous of male offspring. But it is more than doubtful whether the three verses belonged together originally. The various readings ev\u00e1m tv\u00e1m g\u00e1rbham \u0101 dhatsva in verse 2, and vish\u1e47o in verse 3, seem\n\n---\n\n1 Khila 30, 1 in Max M\u00fcller\u2019s Rigveda (second edition), vol. iv. p. 540; Aufrecht, vol. ii. p. 687.\n2 This line occurs, Av. v. 25, 2; vi. 17, 1, with the various reading mah\u00ed bh\u016bt\u0101n\u0101m for mahyutt\u0101n\u0101. The Mantrap\u0101tha i. 12, 4 reads in the same verse mah\u00ed tish\u1e6dhanti.\n3 Mantrap\u0101tha i. 12, 4 has the important variant ev\u00e1m tv\u00e1m g\u00e1rbham \u0101 dhatsva.\n4 Mantrap\u0101tha i. 12, 6 has the vocative vish\u1e47o, which is also supported by Av. v. 25, 10\u201313.\n5 This is the reading of Av. v. 25, 10. The Khila MSS. have p\u00fam\u0101psam putr\u0101n, and da\u00e7asy\u0101m putr\u0101n. The Bombay edition of the Rigveda by R\u0101j\u0101-R\u0101ma\u00e7\u0101stri and \u00c7iva-R\u0101ma\u00e7\u0101stri, has also p\u00fam\u0101psam putr\u0101n. Mantrap. l.c. has p\u00fam\u0101psam g\u00e1rbham.\n6 It is not necessary to correct asy\u0101m n\u0101ry\u0101m to asy\u0101 n\u0101ry\u0101, the reading of Av. v. 25, 10. (See Stenzler\u2019s note to his translation of \u0100\u00e7v. Grhy. i. 14, 3.) We can explain it as meaning literally \u2018into this woman, namely into her womb.\u2019\nfar more plausible than the readings of the Khila MSS. If we separate the three verses, we should translate differently:\n\n(1) \"O Nejamesha! fly away, and fly hither again bringing a beautiful son; to me here who am longing for a son grant thou,\" etc.\n\n(2) \"Just as . . . . the embryo (of plants), so shalt thou conceive an embryo to be born in the tenth month.\"\n\n(3) \"O Vi\u1e63\u1e47u! place thou a male child, to be born in the tenth month, into the womb of this woman, (a child endowed) with a most beautiful form.\"\n\nIn that case the first Mantra only would be addressed to Nejameeha, and it would be a prayer used by a woman who wishes to have a son. The other two Mantras are ordinary garbh\u0101dh\u0101na-Mantras spoken by the husband.\u00b9\n\nThis Khila occurs after Rigveda x. 184, and the Rgvidh\u0101na iv. 23 states briefly that both the hymn 'vi\u1e63\u1e47ur yonim' (x. 184) and the Khila 'nejamesha' are to be employed if a woman who has attained to maturity does not conceive. As Rv. x. 184 can only be meant for a prayer of the husband, the rule of the Rgvidh\u0101na seems to imply that both hymn x. 184 and the Khila are to be recited by the husband. I give the passage from Dr. R. Meyer's edition of the Rgvidh\u0101na:\n\npushpam dr\u1e63\u1e6dv\u0101 tu ya garbham na g\u1e5bhi\u1e47y\u0101d vayovit\u0101 |\n'vi\u1e63\u1e47ur yonim' 'nejamesha' yonim spr\u015btv\u0101 tato japet ||\n\nThese three Mantras are prescribed in the G\u1e5bhyas\u016btras as prayers to be used for certain ceremonies connected with conception and pregnancy. According to \u0100\u00e7v. G\u1e5bhy. i. 14, 3 and \u00c7\u0101\u1e45kh. G\u1e5bhy. i. 22, 7, these Mantras are to be used with certain burnt oblations offered at the \u015aimantonnayana or Parting of the Hair. This is an important rite, performed in the fourth or seventh month after conception, and probably intended to secure male offspring.\n\n\u00b9 See also Stenzler's German translation of the \u0100\u00e7val\u0101yana-G\u1e5bhyas\u016btra, p. 39 (note to i. 14, 9).\nThe same three Mantras, though not as one hymn, occur again in the *Mantrap\u0101\u1e6dha*,\u00b9 the Prayer-book of the \u0100pastambins, i. 12. Here we find first the three verses of RV. x. 184, followed by the verse *y\u0101they\u0101m prthivi*, etc. (Khila 30, 2) and another similar verse, after which we have *vish\u1e47o g\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6dhena*, etc. (Khila 30, 3) and *N\u0113jamesha p\u0101r\u0101 pata*, etc. (Mantrap. i. 12, 7), followed by six other *garbh\u0101dh\u0101na*-verses, the whole forming a prayer which, according to \u0100past. Grhy. 8, 13, is recited by the husband at the time of cohabitation (*rtu-sam\u0101ve\u00e7ane*). Here there can be no doubt that only the one verse *N\u0113jamesha p\u0101r\u0101 pata*, etc., is addressed to the god Nejamesha.\n\nWe meet again with the same three verses in the *M\u0101nava Grhyas\u016btra*, and here they are not only given in the same order in which they occur in the Khila of the Rigveda, and in the Grhyas\u016btras of \u0100\u00e7val\u0101yana and \u00c7\u0101\u1e45kh\u0101yana, but they are distinctly meant to be addressed to the god Nejamesha. According to the M\u0101n. Grhy. ii. 18, a certain sacrifice, the *sha\u1e0d\u0101hutam*, is to be performed at the beginning of every fortnight during a whole year by a person who is desirous of having a son. But if, after the lapse of one year, this ceremony proves of no avail he should have recourse to the *Naijamesha Sth\u0101lp\u0101ka*, the Pan-cake offering in honour of Nejamesha. Having cooked a pan-cake for Nejamesha, the S\u016btra says, he should offer it according to the rite of the *sha\u1e0d\u0101huta* sacrifice (*naijamesh\u0101 sth\u0101lp\u0101k\u0101 \u00e7rapayitv\u0101 yath\u0101 sha\u1e0d\u0101hutam*), with the three verses, *N\u0113jamesha p\u0101r\u0101 pata*, etc.\u00b2\n\nA similar passage occurs in the K\u0101\u1e6dhaka Grhyas\u016btra 38, but here only the one verse, *N\u0113jamesha p\u0101r\u0101 pata*, etc., is given.\u00b3\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 I hope to publish an edition of this text in the 'Anedota Oxoniensia' Series shortly, nearly the whole of the text being in type.\n\n\u00b2 I am indebted to Professor Knauer, of Kiew, who is preparing an edition of the M\u0101nava Grhyas\u016btra, for kindly communicating to me the passage given above from this important text.\n\n\u00b3 See Prof. Jolly's article, 'Das Dharmas\u016btra des Vish\u1e47u und das K\u0101\u1e6dhaka-grhyas\u016btra' (Sitzungsber. der philos.-philol. Classe der bayerischen Akademie der Wiss. vom 7. Juni, 1879), p. 80.\nWe see, then, that in the Mantra 'N\u00e9jamesha p\u00e1ra pata,' Nejamesha is referred to as a (winged?) deity who is supposed to grant children, especially sons, to parents longing for them. In the Grhyas\u016btras, too, Nejamesha is a son-granting deity, and never a demon dangerous to children ('Ein best. den Kindern gef\u00e4hrlicher Unhold,' Petersburg Dictionaries). We meet in the Grhyas\u016btras with a great number of names of demons causing children's diseases, such as \u00c7anda, Marka, Upavira, \u00c7an\u1e0dikeya, Ulukhala, and many others, but neither Nejamesha nor Naigamesha is among them.\n\nThe Vedic Nejamesha, therefore, comes in this respect nearer the Jaina deity than the Naigamesha of the medical books. On the other hand, Nejamesha is not described as goat-headed or ram-headed.\n\nA goat-headed or ram-headed divine being is Naigamesha as described in the medical S\u0101mhit\u0101s. In the Su\u00e7ruta Naigamesha appears as one of the nine Grahas or demons causing children's diseases (Uttaratantra, Adhy. 27). He is described (ibid. Adhy. 37) as 'a ram-faced demon (graha) created by P\u0101rvat\u012b, carrying off little children, a most intimate friend of the god Guha':\n\nNaigameshas tu P\u0101reaty\u0101 \u015br\u1e63\u1e6do mesh\u0101nano graha\u1e25 |\nkum\u0101radh\u0101ri devasya Guhasy\u0101tmasa\u1e41ah sakha ||\n\nThe disease caused by Naigamesha is fully described, and remedies are given against it. And it is interesting to observe that among these remedies there is also an offering (bali) to be made to Naigamesha, who is here (Uttaratantra, Adhy. 36) called 'goat-faced,' and is invoked like a real deity:\n\naj\u0101nana\u00e7 cal\u0101kshibhr\u016bh k\u0101mar\u016bpi mah\u0101ya\u00e7\u0101\u1e25 |\nb\u0101lam p\u0101layit\u0101 devo Naigamesho 'bhirakshatu ||\n\n'The protecting god Naigamesha, the goat-faced, with\n\n---\n\n1 See P\u0101raskara Grhy. i. 16, 28 seq.; Apastambhya Grhy. 18, 1, with Mantrap\u0101tha, ii. 16, 1-11; Hira\u1e47yake\u00e7in Grhy. ii. 8, 7.\nquivering eyes and brows, he who changes his form at will,\\(^1\\) the highly famed, may protect the child!\\(^2\\)\n\nThe above-mentioned Guha is a name of Skanda, who, according to the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, is the father of all the Grahas or demons who are so dangerous to little children. And if there could be any doubt as to the identity of the Naigameya of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata and Naigamesha,\\(^3\\) it would be removed by this passage from the \u015au\u1e63ruta; for the Naigameya of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata is most intimately connected with Skanda, the god of War. According to MBh\u0101r. ix. 44, 36, Skanda, by his Yoga power, assumed at the same time four different forms, vis. those of \u00c7\u0101kha, Vi\u00e7\u0101kha, and Naigameya, besides his own. According to MBh\u0101r. i. 66, 24, these three are the younger brothers of Agni\u2019s son Kum\u0101ra, i.e. Skanda;\\(^4\\) and in MBh\u0101r. iii. 231, 7, Vi\u00e7\u0101kha and Naigameya are given as other names of Skanda or K\u0101rttikeya.\n\nSkanda himself is the father of all the demons who seize little children. For when struck by Indra\u2019s thunderbolt, there arose out of Skanda\u2019s body a great number of beings, followers of Skanda, terrible to look at, all those terrible beings who steal little children, whether born or in the womb. And female children, too, of great power, were born in consequence of that blow with the thunderbolt (MBh\u0101r. iii. 227, 1\u20133). The latter are the Pi\u00e7\u0101cis, who are also extremely dangerous to little children. These are clearly identical with the V\u1e5bddhik\u0101s, those female deities who live on human flesh, and are born in trees, and must be worshipped by people desirous of offspring (MBh\u0101r. iii. 230, 15 seq.).\n\nThis is interesting as showing how closely connected the two ideas are of a deity dangerous to children, and a\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Harinegamosi, too, has the power of transforming himself.\u2014Sacred Books of the East, vol. xxii. p. 228.\n\n\\(^2\\) See B\u00fchlcr, l.c. p. 316, and Petersburg Dictionary, s.v.

And there is, in this respect, not the least difficulty in connecting the Vedic Nejamesha with the Naigamesha of the Su\u00e7ruta and the Naigameya of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. Nor is there any difficulty in connecting these Brahmanical deities with Harin\u0113ganesi, the Jaina deity who exchanges the embryos in the wombs of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47i Dev\u0101nand\u0101 and the Kshatriyan\u012b Tri\u00e7al\u0101, and with Nemeso of the Jaina inscription on the Mathura sculpture discovered by Dr. F\u00fchrer.\n\nIn fact, the Jaina god shares his character as a son-granting deity with the Vedic Nejamesha, while his being represented as ram-headed or goat-headed points to the later Naigamesha,\u00b9 whose name also is more closely connected with the Jaina name.\n\nIt is perhaps not the least important lesson to be derived from the coincidence pointed out by Dr. B\u00fchler, that we learn how impossible it is to separate Vedic or Brahmanic mythology from the mythological conceptions surviving in Jaina\u2014and I may add, Buddhist\u2014literature.\n\n\u00b9 Another point of contact has been mentioned by Dr. B\u00fchler. The Jaina Naigameshin is Indra's general, just as Skanda, of whom\u2014according to one version\u2014Naigameya is only another form, is the field-marshal of the gods. In one passage, MBh\u0101r. iii. 231, 7, Naigameya is given as one of the 61 names of the War-god.\nwhy so late as 1753?...more likely\non the side of the north of the Orkney\nIsles.

The Kh\u00e1mris that we know in Assam are those that have emigrated from \"Bor Kh\u00e1mri\" and have settled in Assam after the breaking up of the kingdom of Pong by Alomphra. These settlers established themselves early in this century on the \"Tenga pani\" (a river in the vicinity of Sadiya), with the permission of the Ahom kings. Before proceeding further, it will be interesting to note that this Kh\u00e1mri movement is the second instance of Tai emigration that we have on record. Some considerable time previously the Ahoms (who spoke a language much akin to the Kh\u00e1mri tongue, and who are also of the Tai race,) made an irruption over the P\u00e1tkoi range and invaded and conquered Assam. The Kh\u00e1mris, who had apparently been given hospitality by the Ahoms because they were almost kinsmen, before long rose against the Ahom king, and ejected the Ahom governor of Sadiya or \"Sadiya Kh\u00f3wa Gohain.\" The Kh\u00e1mri chief took the governor's place and retained it. The Ahom king, not being strong enough to oust the Kh\u00e1mri usurper, had to recognize him. During the rule of this chief the local Assamese were reduced to slavery, and they were not released till our own Government interfered in 1839. Out of revenge the Kh\u00e1mris rebelled against our Government, and the Sadiya garrison, including its commander, Col. White, was surprised and cut up. This led\n\n\\(^1\\) This seems to agree with Mr. Cust's language map. The larger patch of Kh\u00e1mri is, I conclude, \"Bor Kh\u00e1mri,\" and the smaller patch the Kh\u00e1mri settlement at Sadiya.\nto reprisals on our part, and the Kh\u00e1mris were attacked, defeated, and scattered abroad. During the following year many of them returned to their home in Bor Kh\u00e1mri. Those that remained divided into four parties, and settled in different parts of the Lakhimpur district. In 1850 a fresh colony, numbering 300 to 400 persons, came and settled in Assam. The total number living in the province in 1891 was 3040,\\(^1\\) against 2883 in 1881. Mr. Gait, the Provincial Census Superintendent, says \"the real increase is slightly greater, as the 1881 figures include the Phaki\u00e1ls.\" The Phaki\u00e1ls are a kindred tribe, and I will note about them further on. The Kh\u00e1mris live in fairly large villages, the houses of which are built on platforms several feet above the ground. The houses are reached by means of a ladder, which is often the notched trunk of a tree. The houses themselves are comfortable, substantially built, with good roofs. Men, women, and children, apparently, all live together in the same room, but there are partitions for the married people. The costume of both men and women is picturesque. Although perhaps not quite so showy as the Burmese, the costumes are very similar. The men's dress is a blue cotton jacket and a sort of kilt of checked cloth or silk, which looks like a plaid. The women's dress is the same, only that they wear a cloth tightly bound round the chest and tied under the arms, instead of a jacket. The Kh\u00e1mris that I have seen looked strong and robust. They had faces of the usual Chinese type, with high cheek-bones, and small peculiarly shaped eyes, and with scanty beard. They did not appear as dark as the Ahoms, and they certainly looked cleaner and neater. The men wear their hair in a sort of top-knot, whereas the Ahoms wear it in a knob, shaped like a door-knocker, at the back of the head. The Kh\u00e1mris suffer terribly from goitre, but this is not uncommon both in the plains as well as the hills. The Tair\u00f3ngs, Aitanias, and Naras, who are the kinsmen of the Kh\u00e1mris, are great\n\n\\(^1\\) Census of 1891.\nopium-eaters, and are as well much addicted to liquor. They distil a fairly strong spirit from \"g\u00far\" (molasses), which they often try to sell without a license to the tea-garden coolies, and so get mulcted in fines under the Excise Law. The Kh\u00e1mtis of the N\u00e1raynpur colony in the North Lakhimpur subdivision are an interesting settlement. The late Mr. Stack described this colony at some length in the Assam Census Report of 1881. Mr. Stack says the Kh\u00e1mtis are nominally Buddhists, but the common people worship both Gautama, or \"Kodoma\" as they call him, and Debi or Durga. The N\u00e1raynpur colony is surrounded by Hindu villages, and I do not think that it can escape the subtle proselytising influence of Hinduism long. The Ahoms have almost entirely become Hindus now\u2014only a few of the \"Deodh\u00e1is\" (old Ahom priests) even remember the name of their ancient god \"Ch\u00fang,\" which was said to have been a brass image which was worshipped with mystic rites. Whether this \"Ch\u00fang\" was \"Gautama\" or not it is now difficult to ascertain; but perhaps it was. The Ahoms have now entirely dropped their ancient faith as well as their language. The Kh\u00e1mtis keep Thursday holy as the birthday of Buddha, although they are not aware of the year of his birth. Their priests wear yellow robes, as do their Buddhist brethren in Burma. I noticed this also in the Tair\u00f3ng and Nara villages I have seen. The holy books, as well as brass and stone images of Buddha, are kept in a prayer house (now called b\u00e1pu ghar), generally a little distance from the village. Women are not allowed to enter the \"b\u00e1pu ghar,\" but the priest at the Tair\u00f3ng village I went to did not object to the male unbeliever, although my wife was told to stand outside the house. Sir W. Hunter says that the majority of the Kh\u00e1mti laity, as well as the priesthood, can read and write, and that the chiefs pride themselves upon their manual dexterity in working in metals and in ornamenting their shields of buffalo or rhinoceros hide with gold and lac.\n\n1 Assamese \u09ac\u09be\u09aa\u09c1 (bap\u00fa)=priest.\nThe women also are said to be skilled in embroidery. Where did the Kh\u00e1mtis get all this civilization from? Was it from China?\n\nI should now like to make a few remarks about the Tair\u00f3ngs, Naras, and Aitanias, who, as I have already mentioned, we in Assam regard as the kinsmen of the Kh\u00e1mtis.\n\nThe Tur\u00fangs or Tair\u00f3ngs have been generally regarded as Sh\u00e1ns. The Kh\u00e1mtis call the Sh\u00e1ns \"Tail\u00f3ng\" (great Tais). Tail\u00f3ng has probably become corrupted into Tair\u00f3ng, and finally into Tur\u00fang. Some three or four villages of Tair\u00f3ngs are to be found in the Sibsagar district. The Tair\u00f3ngs themselves claim to be Sh\u00e1ns, and to be far above even the Kh\u00e1mtis, who, in their turn, look down on the Tair\u00f3ngs (at least the Jorh\u00e1t colony). Quite recently I came across a book in a Tair\u00f3ng village, a page of which I sent to Mr. Gait, the Census Superintendent, thinking that it was Sh\u00e1n. Mr. Gait sent the page to Mr. Needham, at Sadiya, who declared it to be pure Kh\u00e1mti, both as regards idiom and character. These Tair\u00f3ngs had another book, which appeared to be Burmese. Strange to say these Tair\u00f3ngs themselves spoke Singpho, the explanation of this being as follows: The Tair\u00f3ngs, who originally lived somewhere in the direction of the Upper Irrawaddy, started for Assam to join some Naras who had preceded them thither. Unfortunately for them they had to pass through the Singpho country (vide Mr. Cust's language map). As they passed through the country they were taken captives by the Singphos. They remained as captives for five years according to their own account, but probably for longer, as they quite forgot their own language and adopted the language of their captors. It is strange that even to this day the Tair\u00f3ngs speak nothing but Singpho. After a time the Tair\u00f3ngs were rescued by Captain de Neufville, and were brought by him in safety to Assam. The Tair\u00f3ngs intermarry with the Naras, who are rather more numerous than the former. The Naras apparently speak Kh\u00e1mti or Sh\u00e1n, I am not certain which, but they understand Singpho. The Naras have some six or eight villages\naltogether in the Sibsagar district. They are indistinguishable from the Tair\u00f3ngs in appearance. Mr. Cust, writing about the Kh\u00e1mtis, says\u00b9: \"The original name of the tribe appears to have been Nara, and to have had two subdivisions, 'Aikham' or Kh\u00e1mti to the north, and 'Aiton' to the south.\" If this be the case probably the Naras are Kh\u00e1mtis, and the Aitonias, of whom there are, I think, three villages in the Golaghat subdivision, are Kh\u00e1mtis also. There are also some Aiton villages, I believe, in Lakhimpur. With reference to Mr. Cust's remarks on \"Aiton,\" p. 122, I agree, at present, in thinking that Aiton is not a separate language but a dialect of Kh\u00e1mti. I will, however, make enquiries about this when I return to Assam. There are some people in the Sibsagar district, inhabiting two villages, I think, called D\u00f3anias. These people also, I think, are allied to the Kh\u00e1mtis, notwithstanding the idea that prevails that they are a relict of the Burmese invasion of Assam. The Assamese call them D\u00f3anias from the word (\u09a6\u09cb\u09be\u09a8\u09bf\u09af\u09bc\u09be) (d\u00f3aniya) meaning \"interpreter.\" Possibly these people may have acted as interpreters for the Ahoms with the Burmese. It would be interesting to make enquiries about these people also. Possibly the Phaki\u00e1s of Jeypur, in Lakhimpur, who were in 1881 returned as Kh\u00e1mtis at the census, may prove to be Kh\u00e1mtis also; but this is more doubtful. Before leaving the subject it should be stated that Ahom and Kh\u00e1mti are connected. I have selected thirty-two words at haphazard from Hodgson's vocabularies for the purpose of comparison. Out of thirty-two, eighteen words are identical in Ahom and Kh\u00e1mti. In most of the remainder it will be observed that the only difference is the phonetic change or some prefix\u2014for instance, the Ahom word b\u00e1n (village) becomes m\u00e1n in Kh\u00e1mti. The Lao and Siamese word for village is also b\u00e1n, and the Khyeng is n\u00e1m. Take the Ahom word, laling, for monkey. In Kh\u00e1mti the prefix la is dropped.\n\n\u00b9 \"Modern Languages of the East Indies,\" p. 122.\nIn Sh\u00e1n the word is *lein*, and in Siamese *leun* or *ling*. The Ahom and Kh\u00e1mti numerals are almost identical, e.g.:\n\n| Kh\u00e1mti | Ahom |\n|--------|------|\n| 1. l\u00fcng | ling |\n| 2. s\u00e4ng | sang |\n| 3. s\u00e1m | sam |\n| 4. s\u00ed | si

Perhaps some of our Burmah officers or missionaries may be able to throw light on the subject.\\(^1\\) The character is an adaptation of the Pali, which has been used in the formation of the characters of many other languages. Some of these are Burmese, Karen, Sinhalese, Pegu, and perhaps Telugu, Kanarese, and Tulu. It would be interesting to know how the Kh\u00e1matis came to adopt the same character as the Sinhalese?\n\nIn conclusion I would call attention to the excellent grammar of the language published by Mr. Needham. It is well arranged for the object in view, i.e. to help frontier officers and others to learn Kh\u00e1mti.\n\n\\(^1\\) See Sir W. W.

His essential character as the Preserver in Hinduism is displayed in his Avat\u0101rs or incarnations, by means of which he appears on earth as the friend and helper of humanity in distress. \"For the defence of the good and the suppression of the wicked,\" he is made to say in the Bhagavadg\u012bt\u0101 (IV. 7-8), \"for the establishment of justice, I manifest myself from age to age.\" The Br\u0101hma\u1e47as know nothing of the theory of Avat\u0101rs,\u00b9 which are not mere transitory manifestations of the deity, but the real presence of the supreme god in mundane beings.\u00b2 In the great Epics, however, the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata and the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, the theory is already fully recognised.\u00b3\n\nThe origin of this theory, though ultimately to be traced to the frequent identification of one god with another in the Rigveda, is more closely connected with the development of this idea in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, in which the gods are identified with substances also, and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u in particular is constantly identified with the sacrifice. Even in the Rig-\n\n\u00b9 See Barth, Religions of India, Engl. tr. p. 166.\n\u00b2 Ibid. p. 170.\n\u00b3 The belief in the ten incarnations of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u had become an ordinary dogma of Hinduism by 1014 A.D. See Bhandarkar in Transactions of the Ninth Congress of Orientalists, 1892, vol. i. pp. 425-6.\nveda itself there is one passage\\(^1\\) where reference is made in the following words to a form of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u different from his ordinary one: 'Do not conceal from us this form, since thou didst assume another form in battle.' The development of the theory of incarnations may also have been assisted by the survival in the Vedic religion of a primitive belief, universally prevalent in the savage stage, in the power of metamorphosis,\\(^2\\) by which men, and consequently gods also, could change themselves or their neighbours into beasts.\\(^3\\)\n\nHowever, though the doctrine of the Avat\u0101rs is not to be found in the Veda, the enquiry as to how far the origin of any of these creations of later mythology can be traced in Vedic literature is both interesting and important.\n\nTraces of the Hindu Vi\u1e63\u1e47u's general character as the Preserver are already to be met with in the Rigveda. He is beneficent (I. 156, 5), is innocuous and bountiful (VIII. 25, 12), a protector (I. 22, 18; III. 55, 10), an innocuous and generous protector (I. 155, 4), a preserver of embryos (VII. 36, 9). He is said to have traversed the earthly regions for Manu or man in his distress (VI. 49, 13),\\(^4\\) to have traversed this earth to bestow it for a habitation on Manu (VII. 100, 4), to have traversed the earthly regions for wide-stepping existence (I. 155, 4), and with Indra to have taken vast strides as well as stretched out the worlds for our existence (VI. 69, 5, 6). In his footsteps all beings abide (I. 154, 2), and he sustains heaven and earth and all beings (ibid. 4).\n\nAs regards the incarnations of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the sources of four of them are to be found in Vedic literature.\n\nThe earliest form of the myths of his tortoise and fish Avat\u0101rs occurs in the \u015aatapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, though in neither case is Vi\u1e63\u1e47u there mentioned as connected with the tortoise or the fish.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) VII. 100, 6.\n\n\\(^2\\) Thus in RV. VII. 104, 18 demons are spoken of as flying about at night, having assumed the form of birds (vayo ye bh\u016bte\u015bi).\n\n\\(^3\\) Cp. Lang, Myth, Ritual and Religion, vol. i. pp. 88 and 117.\n\n\\(^4\\) Manave b\u0101dhit\u0101ya, explained by S\u0101yana as acurair himsiit\u0101ya.\nIn the Pur\u0101\u1e47as it is Vi\u1e63\u1e47u who assumed the form of a tortoise, with the beneficent purpose of recovering objects of value lost in the deluge. With this view he placed himself in the form of a tortoise at the bottom of the ocean of milk as a pivot for a mountain to spin on, while the gods and Asuras were engaged in churning that ocean.\\(^1\\)\n\nComparing this account with that of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47a period, we find that in \u015aB. VII. 5, 1, 5,\\(^2\\) it is Praj\u0101pati who before creating offspring assumes the form of a tortoise, and that in the Taittir\u012bya \u0100ra\u1e47yaka, I. 23, 3, the fluid part of the creative Praj\u0101pati becomes a tortoise moving among the waters.\\(^3\\) Here it is not yet Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the supreme god of the later period, but Praj\u0101pati, the chief of the pantheon of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as,\\(^4\\) who assumes this form; and the purpose he has in view is the creation of the world, not the recovery of lost objects. That the creator should be supposed to have assumed the form of an amphibious animal like the tortoise\\(^5\\) is natural owing to the notion in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as that the universe in the beginning was all water.\\(^6\\)\n\nThe Matsya, Bh\u0101gavata, and Agni Pur\u0101\u1e47as describe how Manu, the ancestor of the human race, was preserved from destruction in the deluge by a fish, an incarnation of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, which by means of its horn drew his ship across the ocean to its resting-place. The tale told in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata is similar, but the fish is there an incarnation of Brahm\u0101 Praj\u0101pati. The story in the \u015aB. (I. 8, 1, 1) is essentially the same, except that it is simply a fish that delivers Manu from the deluge.\\(^7\\) Nothing is said about it being an incarnation of any deity. But it is natural that both the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Bh\u0101gavata Pur\u0101\u1e47a, I. 3, 16; see Muir, OST. vol. iv. p. 27.\n\n\\(^2\\) Cp. Muir, I. p. 54, and IV. p. 27.\n\n\\(^3\\) Cp.

VII. i. 5, 1; TB. I. i. 3, 5.\n\n\\(^7\\) The myth of the deluge occurs in the Avesta also, and may be Indo-European: see Lindner, Die iranische Flutage, in Festspuren an Roth, pp. 213-6. The majority of scholars have, however, hitherto regarded this myth as derived from a Semitic source: cp. Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, p. 276, note 3.\ntortoise and the fish should have become in the later period appropriated to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u as the preserver of mankind.\n\nThe mythological germ of two other incarnations of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u can be traced right back to the Rigveda; and it is moreover there closely connected with Vi\u1e63\u1e47u as well.\n\nVi\u1e63\u1e47u's V\u0101mana or Dwarf Incarnation.\n\nThe essential element of this myth is the three steps taken by Vi\u1e63\u1e47u in order to preserve the world from the domination of the Asura or demon Bali.\n\nThe form of the legend as narrated in the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a\u00b9 is in substance as follows: \"Bali, son of Virocana, having conquered Indra, the chief of the gods, enjoyed the empire of the three worlds. Then Indra and the other gods begged Vi\u1e63\u1e47u to assume the shape of a dwarf and ask a boon of Bali, who, when performing sacrifice, was willing to bestow on suppliants whatever they requested. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, accordingly appearing as a dwarf before Bali, asked for what he could cover with three of his own paces. On this being granted he assumed a miraculous form and occupied with the first step the whole earth, with the second the air, and with the third the sky. Then removing his enemy to the lower regions, he restored the empire of the three worlds to Indra.\"\n\nThe legend related in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, where Vi\u1e63\u1e47u likewise traverses earth, air, and sky with his three steps, as well as in the Pur\u0101\u1e47as, is substantially the same.\u00b2\n\nWorking backwards we come to a similar tale in the \u015aB.,\u00b3 where Vi\u1e63\u1e47u already figures as a dwarf. In substance it is briefly as follows: \"The Asuras on overcoming the gods began dividing the earth. The gods, placing Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the sacrifice, at their head, came to them and said, 'Let us also have a share in the earth.' The Asuras replied that they would give the gods as much as this Vi\u1e63\u1e47u could\n\n\u00b9 I. 32 ff; cp. Muir, IV. pp. 133-5.\n\u00b2 See Muir, IV. pp. 135-156.\n\u00b3 I. ii. 5; see Muir, IV. pp. 122-3; cp. also Eggeling's note in SBE. vol. xii. p. 59.\nlie on. Now Vi\u1e63\u1e47u was a dwarf.\\(^1\\) The gods accepted the offer, thinking \u2018the Asuras have given us much indeed, as they have given what is equal in size to the sacrifice.\u2019 Thus by sacrificing with Vi\u1e63\u1e47u they acquired the whole earth.\u201d No mention is here made of the three steps of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u; but in \u015aB. I. ix. 3, 9, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is said to have gained their all-pervading power for the gods by taking his three strides.\n\nThe following is a curious variation of the above story occurring in TS. VI. ii. 4: \u201cThis earth formerly belonged to the Asuras, while the gods only had as much as a man can see while sitting. When the gods asked for a share in the earth, the Asuras said, \u2018How much shall we give you?\u2019 The gods replied, \u2018As much as this she-jackal can go round in three steps.\u2019 So Indra, assuming the form of a she-jackal, stepped round the earth in three strides. Thus the gods obtained the earth.\u201d\\(^2\\)\n\nHere we have the three steps, but it is Indra, not Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, who takes them. This substitution is without doubt due to the intimate association of the two gods in the Rigveda. Thus in RV. VI. 69, where Indra and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u are celebrated together as a dual divinity, it is said (v. 5) that they both took wide strides in the exhilaration of Soma.\\(^3\\)\n\nIn the Aitareya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a (VI. 15) it is related that Indra and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, engaged in a conflict with the Asuras, agreed with the latter that as much as Vi\u1e63\u1e47u could stride over in three steps should belong to the two deities. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u accordingly strode over these worlds, the Vedas, and speech. Here we have the three steps of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u as well as his close association with Indra.\n\nComing finally to the RV., we find that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s main characteristic there is that he took three steps. This action is expressly referred to twelve or thirteen times in the RV.\n\nAs there is some division of opinion regarding the interpretation of these three steps, it seems worth while here to\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Cp. TS. II. i. 3, 1, where Vi\u1e63\u1e47u in the conflict of the gods and Asuras, having seen a dwarf and having taken him for his own divinity, conquered the three worlds. Cp. also TB. I. vi. 1, 5.\n\n\\(^2\\) See Muir, IV. p. 40.\n\n\\(^3\\) Indr\u0101\u015bc\u012bp\u0101 t\u0101t panay\u0101yyam v\u0101m s\u014dmasya m\u0101da ur\u016b cakram\u0101th\u0113.\nexamine the question with some attention. What, then, was originally intended by the three strides of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u? The naturalistic interpretation generally favoured by European scholars takes them to represent the rising, culminating, and setting of the sun. This view was also held by the ancient Indian scholar Aurnav\u0101bha (quoted by Y\u0101ska in Nirukta XII. 19), who thought that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s steps were planted \u2018on the hill where he rises (sam\u0101roha\u1e47a), on the meridian (vi\u1e63\u1e47upade), and on the hill where he sets (gay\u0101\u015brasi).\u2019 The alternative interpretation holds the three steps to represent the sun as he traverses in his diurnal course the three worlds of earth, air, and heaven\u2014the triple division of the universe familiar to Vedic cosmology. This view was held by \u015a\u0101kap\u016b\u1e47i, another predecessor, who is quoted by Y\u0101ska in the same passage, and who thought that the three footsteps were placed \u2018on earth, in the atmosphere, and in the sky,\u2019 as terrestrial fire, as lightning, and as the sun respectively, according to Durga\u2019s comment. The commentator on VS. V. 15 (=RV. I. 22, 17) practically agrees with this view, describing Vi\u1e63\u1e47u as Agni-V\u0101yu-S\u016brya.\n\nThis explanation also prevails throughout the younger Vedas and the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as; and, as we have already seen, it is that of the Epics and the Pur\u0101\u1e47as.\n\nWe have yet to examine the evidence of the RV. itself.\n\n---\n\n1 For instance, Max M\u00fcller, *Vedic Hymns*, SBE. XXXII. p. 133; Kaegi, *Rigveda*, note 213 (Arrowsmith\u2019s translation); cp. Oldenberg, *Religion des Veda*, p. 228.\n\n2 Hardy, *Vedisch-Brahmanische Periode*, p. 33, thinks that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u halts twice during the day, morning and evening, then assuming the functions of the moon(!) as his third step.\n\n3 A trace of this notion is to be found in the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a, IV. 40, 57 (cp. Muir, IV. p. 440). As Oldenberg, *Religion des Veda*, p. 228, observes, this view cannot be made to agree with several passages of the RV., nor can any at all definite connection with morning, noon, and night be found there. Oldenberg, who does not touch on the alternative view, is inclined to think that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is conceived as taking three strides merely owing to the favour shown to the number three in mythology.\n\n4 Bergaigne, *Religion V\u00e9dique*, II. p. 414, thinks that a satisfactory explanation can only be obtained from the conception of the three places of Agni, of which one is the sun.\n\n5 Cp. Roth, ZDMG. 1882, p. 68; Wallis, *Cosmology of the Rigveda*, p. 114.\n\n6 Cp. Nirukta, VII. 5.\n\n7 VS. II. 25, xii. 5, xxiii. 49; TS. I. vii. 5, 4; II. iv. 12, 2.\n\n8 S'B. I. ix. 3, 9; VI. vii. 4, 7.\nVi\u1e63\u1e47u is more than a dozen times spoken of as 'wide-going' (urug\u0101ya) or 'wide-striding' (urukrama), and is ten times also stated to have taken\\(^1\\) three steps,\\(^2\\) or to have stepped\\(^3\\) three times,\\(^4\\) and his three steps are besides twice mentioned, without reference to striding. He is also once said to abide in three stations.\\(^5\\)\n\nClassifying these passages, we find it stated that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2014\n\n(1) Took three steps (I. 22, 18; VIII. 12, 27).\n(2) Strode with three steps through this world (idam): I. 22, 17, or traversed with three steps this wide extended sphere (sadha\u015btam): I. 154, 3.\n(3) Traversed the earthly regions (p\u0101rthiv\u0101ni r\u0101j\u0101\u1e43si), and fixed the upper sphere (uttaram sadha\u015btam) while stepping thrice (I. 154, 1).\n(4) Stepped widely over the earthly scil. regions (p\u0101rthiv\u0101ni) with three strides (I. 155, 4); thrice traversed the earthly regions (r\u0101j\u0101\u1e43si p\u0101rthiv\u0101ni): VI. 49, 13.\n(5) Thrice traversed this earth (et\u0101m prthir\u012bm): VII. 100, 3. 4.\n(6) Strode three (steps) (thither) where the gods rejoice (VIII. 29, 7).\n\nAll that we can gather from the above statements as to the locality of the steps is, that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u traversed the earthly regions, the earth, or the world, which in (2) may be the same as the earth, but in (3) includes the upper region (=heaven). The last passage (6), however, gives some additional information as to the goal of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u's steps. It occurs in a hymn describing in each of its verses a different deity, who is made recognisable by his most distinctive characteristics, his name never being mentioned. Now it is certainly not a salient characteristic of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u that he strode thrice 'where the gods rejoice,' according to the usual translation.\\(^6\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Generally a form of vi-kram (eight times).\n\\(^2\\) Tri\u1e63i pad\u0101ni (four times).\n\\(^3\\) Once 'stepped widely,' uru krami\u1e63\u1e6da; twice 'traversed' (the earth), vi-mame.\n\\(^4\\) Tri\u0101 (twice), trekh\u0101 (twice), trihi\u1e25 padebh\u012b\u1e25 (once), tribhir vig\u0101ma\u1e25bhi\u1e25 (once).\n\\(^5\\) Triadha\u015btha (I. 166, 5), an epithet otherwise applied only to Agni and Soma.\n\\(^6\\) Tri\u1e63i \u0113ka urug\u0101y\u014d vi cakrame ydtra dev\u0101\u015bo m\u0101danti.\nit may be said to be distinctive of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u's highest step that it is the abode of the gods, of pious souls, and of Soma.\\(^1\\) The place, moreover, where the gods rejoice is the height of heaven,\\(^2\\) and in none of the above passages is Vi\u1e63\u1e47u described as taking his three steps in heaven. *Yatra* must, therefore, here mean 'thither where,' as it does in several cases with verbs of motion,\\(^3\\) and we must render 'Vi\u1e63\u1e47u strode with his three steps to the place where the gods rejoice,' i.e. to the third station which is most characteristically his.\\(^4\\)\n\nTwo other passages, in which there is no reference to striding, describe Vi\u1e63\u1e47u's three steps and make it clearer what they mean. In I. 155, 5 (which immediately follows the verse stating that he strode through the earthly regions with his three strides) the poet says: 'Two steps of him the sunlike the busy mortal sees, but no one ventures to approach the third, not even the soaring winged birds'; and in VII. 99, 1 the god is addressed with the words: 'We know both thy regions of the earth (*rajasi prthiry\u0101\u1e25*); thou, divine Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, knowest the highest.' The comparison of these two passages makes it clear that the highest step is the third.\n\nThere are five other passages in which the highest step of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is mentioned. In V. 3, 3 we read that 'Agni guards the secret name of the cows\\(^5\\) (with=) in the highest step of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u'; while in X. 1, 3 Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is said to know Agni's highest (place), and to guard (it) the third.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See below, p. 173.\n\n\\(^2\\) See Oldenberg, *op. cit.*, p. 228.\n\n\\(^3\\) See *yatra* in Grassmann's Lexicon.\n\n\\(^4\\) The place whence Vi\u1e63\u1e47u strides is referred to in I. 22, 16: 'May the gods preserve us from the place whence Vi\u1e63\u1e47u strode over the seven places of the earth' (*ato dev\u0101 avanti no yato Vi\u1e63\u1e47ur vicakrame prthivy\u0101\u1e25 septa dh\u0101mat\u0101\u1e25*; SV. *prthivy\u0101d adhi s\u0101navi*, 'over the surface of the earth'). This would refer to the region of the dawns, where the pious dead are sometimes supposed to dwell (cp. X. 15, 7, 'seated in the lap of the dawns'). In V. 87, 4 the wide-striding god, it is said, strode from the great common abode, and issues from his own abode on the ridges (*adhi prabhik*) when he has yoked his steeds.\n\n\\(^5\\) I.e. guards the clouds, the mystic name of which is 'cows'; cp. 'the many-horned swiftly-moving cows' in the mansions of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u (I. 164, 6); see below, p. 174.\nThese two passages show that the highest step of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\\(^1\\) is connected with the highest and third place of Agni,\\(^2\\) which is the sun.\n\nThe verses I. 22, 20, 21 are more explicit: here Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s highest step is likened to an eye (\\(i.e.\\) the sun)\\(^3\\) fixed in heaven; and this highest step singers are said to light up (the sun being like a sacrificial fire in heaven). It is thus evident that the highest place of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is where the sun is in the meridian.\n\nIn I. 154, 5 the poet prays: \u2018May I attain to that dear abode (\\(p\u0101thah\\))\\(^4\\) of his, where pious men rejoice: in the highest step of the wide-striding Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2014for such a kinsman is he\u2014there is a spring of honey.\u2019\n\nHere it is also clear that the highest step of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, his beloved resort,\\(^5\\) where the pious dead abide,\\(^6\\) and where the celestial Soma is concealed,\\(^7\\) is in the highest heavens.\n\nThe next verse (I. 154, 6) goes on to say: \u2018We desire to go to those mansions of you two,\\(^8\\) where\\(^9\\) (are) the many\u2014\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In III. 55, 10 it is said: \u2018Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, the guardian (\\(gop\u0101h\\)), protects the highest abode (\\(p\u0101thah\\)), maintaining the dear immortal dwellings\u2019; cp. I. 154, 5, where pious men rejoice in the dear abode (\\(priyam p\u0101thah\\)) of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.\n\n\\(^2\\) Cp. I. 72, 2, 4.\n\n\\(^3\\) The sun is frequently called the eye of heaven, \\(e.g.\\) in I. 164, 14.\n\n\\(^4\\) Cf. III. 55, 10, quoted in note 1.\n\n\\(^5\\) The place of the sun in his strength would naturally be regarded as the meridian; hence the zenith is called vis\u1e47upada, the step of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u (Nirukta, XII. 19).\n\n\\(^6\\) The highest heaven is their regular abode; cp. Oldenberg, p. 228.\n\n\\(^7\\) VI. 44, 23; cp. Oldenberg, p. 183.\n\n\\(^8\\) T\u016b v\u0101m v\u0101st\u016bni u\u015bm\u0101si g\u0101ma\u1e0dhyasi. Roth, Nirukta, Erl\u00e4uterungen, p. 19 (quoted by Muir, IV. p. 74), thinks that the use of the dual here is a proof that verses have been inserted in wrong places and that the verse is addressed to Mitra-Varuna (the reading of this verse in VS. 6, 3 has a singular pronoun: T\u016b te dh\u0101m\u0101ni u\u015bm\u0101si). But this seems an unnecessary assumption. Why should the dual v\u0101m not refer to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u (to whom the words urug\u0101yasya v\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a\u1e25 obviously apply, as in v. 3 of the same hymn) and Indra, his frequent associate, as both are addressed in the next two verses (I. 155, 1, 2)? The verse is also closely related in sense to the preceding one, besides being in the middle of a group of three hymns (I. 154\u20136) specially devoted to the praise of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Under these circumstances an indirect reference to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s friend Indra seems quite natural.\n\n\\(^9\\) Cp. vicakrama yd\u012bra dev\u0101\u015bo m\u0101danti (VIII. 29, 7)=we wish to go thither where is the third step of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.\nhorned, swiftly-moving cows.\\(^1\\) Here that highest step of the wide-stepping bull\\(^2\\) shines down greatly.\\(^3\\)\n\nOther references to the distinctive abode of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u are the statements that he dwells beyond this lower region,\\(^4\\) that he is mountain-dwelling,\\(^5\\) and that Indra drinks Soma with him or with Trita \u0100ptya.\\(^6\\) The latter trait would refer to the highest heavens, where the celestial Soma is supposed to abide.\\(^7\\)\n\nThat the three steps are those of a sun-god, whose character has become obscured, is supported by the following traces. Besides being wide-stepping or wide-striding, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is also swift (e\u1e63a) or swift-going (eva-y\u0101van). Coupled with this constant idea of motion is that of regularity. Thus, in taking his three steps he observes ordinances;\\(^8\\) like other deities typical of regular recurrence, he is the ancient germ of order\\(^9\\) (like Agni or Soma), an ordainer (vedhas),\\(^10\\) who is both ancient (p\u016brya) and recent\\(^11\\) (navyas) like Agni, S\u016brya, and U\u1e63as. Like another sun-god, Savit\u1e5b,\\(^12\\) he is said to have traversed the earthly regions.\\(^13\\) The last verse of I. 155, which speaks of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u as setting in motion, like a revolving wheel, his ninety steeds (=days) with their four names (=seasons),\\(^14\\) seems to refer to the solar year of 360\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) These cows are doubtless the same as those which Agni guards in the third step of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u (see p. 172, note 5). The cows are the clouds, which are called many-horned (=many-peaked) to keep up the metaphor; note also the use of urjan in the same verse.\n\n\\(^2\\) In v. 3 Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is called \u2018the mountain-dwelling, wide-stepping bull.\u2019 The epithet girikpit here probably refers to the conception of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s characteristic abode being in the highest heavens, whence he would look down from the tops of the cloud-mountains in the zenith. Cp. Oldenberg, p. 230, footnote. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is in TS. III. iv. 5, 1 spoken of as the lord of mountains (parvat\u0101n\u0101m).\n\n\\(^3\\) Cp. I. 22, 20 (quoted above), where the highest step of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is like an eye fixed in heaven. Both passages naturally refer to the sun in the meridian.\n\n\\(^4\\) Aya rajasah par\u0101ke, VII. 100, 4.\n\n\\(^5\\) VIII. 12, 16.\n\n\\(^6\\) VI. 44, 23; cp.

Oldenberg, p. 65, thinks Savit\u1e5b is an abstraction of the notion of instigation (des Antreibens).\n\n\\(^12\\) I. 154, 1; VI. 49, 13. The same expression (vi-mame) is used of Varu\u1e47a, who measured out the earth with the sun (V. 85, 5).\n\n\\(^13\\) The four seasons of the later Rigvedic period; cp. Zimmer, AIL. p. 41.\nIn AV. V. 26, 7 Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is besought to bestow heat (tap\u0101msi) on the sacrifice. In \u015aB. XIV. i. 1, 10 Vi\u1e63\u1e47u's head becomes the sun. Thus we infer from the traces preserved in the Vedas that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u was originally a sun-god, that he was conceived as taking three steps because he traversed in his diurnal course the three divisions of the universe\u2014earth, air, and heaven\u2014and that his third and highest step was regarded as his distinctive abode.\n\nThe leading secondary characteristic of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is his close association with the warlike Indra. This association is probably partly owing to Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, because he takes vast strides, being regarded as a deity of mighty energy, capable of tracking the drought demon to his remotest lurking-place, and partly due to his assuming as solar fire qualities, strictly speaking, peculiar to the god of Fire, Agni, in his lightning form. It is doubtless from this latter aspect that Agni is so often joined with Indra in his conflicts against the demons, and is extolled with him as a dual divinity in more hymns than with any other god. So Vi\u1e63\u1e47u also comes to be coupled with Indra both as a great Soma-drinker and as a conqueror of foes, a whole hymn (VI. 69) being dedicated to their joint praise in this character. Accordingly Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is several times called Indra's intimate friend or comrade, and is especially associated with him in the slaughter of V\u1e5btra; both are said to have triumphed over the D\u0101sa, to have destroyed \u015aambara's ninety-nine castles, and to have conquered the hosts of Varcin. Indra, about to slay V\u1e5btra, says: 'Friend Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, stride more widely\n\n---\n\n1 Cp. I. 164, 48: 'the twelve fellies, the one wheel, the three naves\u2014who understands that? In it together are fixed, as it were, 360 moving and not moving spokes'; and v. 11 of the same hymn: 'the twelve-spoked wheel of eternal order rolls around the sky, and wears not out; in it stand, O Agni, 720 twin sons.' Cp. Zimmer, AIL, p. 368.\n\n2 Conversely the epithet distinctive of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, urugdy\u0101, seems to be applied to Agni in III. 6, 4; cp. Muir, IV. p. 77.\n\n3 N\u0101khi, yujya; I. 22, 19; I. 156, 4; IV. 18, 11; VIII. 89, 12.\n\n4 VI. 20, 2.\n\n5 VII. 99, 4, 5.\nforth,'\u00b9 and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is stated to have made his three strides for Vi\u1e63\u1e47u,\u00b2 or by his energy (ojas\u0101).\u00b3\n\nSumming up the main features of the myth of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u's three steps in the Rigveda, we find that\u2014\n\n(1) Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is associated with Indra in his fight with the demons, V\u1e5btra and others, who keep possession of the waters.\n\n(2) Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, by taking his three steps in conjunction with Indra, vanquishes these demons, the result being the release of the waters.\n\n(3) Vi\u1e63\u1e47u takes his strides for man (manu) in his distress or to bestow the earth on him as a habitation.\n\nThe later Vedic literature preserves these essential features modified as follows:\u2014\n\n(1) Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and Indra, or the gods in general, are in conflict with the demons or Asuras, who obtain possession of the earth.\n\n(2) Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, as a dwarf, by taking his strides overcomes the demons and obtains possession of the worlds.\n\n(3) Vi\u1e63\u1e47u takes his strides to regain possession of the earth for the gods.\n\nFor the sake of greater clearness it is worth while to point out the modifications which have been introduced in this second stage.\n\n1. The object of the conflict with the demons is no longer the waters, but is the earth.\n\n2. The gods are no longer uniformly victorious in this conflict, but have been vanquished by the demons. In order to recover their supremacy they are now compelled to have recourse to stratagem. That the Asuras may be induced to give up to them as much as could be covered by three strides, Indra is in one story very naturally made to assume the form of a small and cunning animal, while in the other Vi\u1e63\u1e47u becomes a dwarf so as to remove all suspicion.\n\n\u00b9 IV. 18, 11\u2014VIII. 89, 12.\n\u00b2 V\u0101lakhilya, 4, 3.\n\u00b3 VIII. 12, 27.\nintroduction of the dwarf is thus a most natural development of the myth. The view of A. Kuhn\\(^1\\) that the dwarf 'represents the sunlight which shrinks into dwarf's size in the evening,' seems therefore to be both fanciful and unnecessary.\n\n3. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u here takes his steps, not for the benefit of man but for that of the gods.\n\nComparing with the second stage of the myth, its latest development in the Epics and Pur\u0101\u1e47as, we find that here\u2014\n\n(1) Indra has been conquered in his conflict with the demon Bali, who obtains the dominion of the three worlds.\n\n(2) Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, urged by Indra and the other gods, assumes the form of a dwarf, takes his three strides through the three worlds, and restores the dominion to Indra.\n\n(3) Vi\u1e63\u1e47u takes his three strides in order to restore the dominion of the three worlds to Indra.\n\nThe only modifications introduced in this latest stage as compared with that which precedes, are the following: Indra alone is now in conflict with an individual demon, and the dominion of the three worlds is now represented as belonging to Indra alone and not to the gods in general.\n\nFrom the above comparisons it becomes clear that the three essential features of the myth in the Epics and Pur\u0101\u1e47as, no less than in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, are already contained in the Rigveda, viz.:\u2014\n\n(1) Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is associated with Indra in conflict with demons.\n\n(2) Vi\u1e63\u1e47u overcomes the demons by taking three strides.\n\n(3) Vi\u1e63\u1e47u in so doing gains possession of the earth.\\(^2\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Ueber Entwicklungsstufen der Mythenbildung, p. 128.\n\n\\(^2\\) Muir, vol. IV. p. 122, has pointed out that the story related in the S.B. I. ii. 5 (quoted above, p. 168), contains the germ of the story of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u's Dwarf Incarnation. I have here endeavoured to show that the main elements of the myth are already to be found in the Rigveda.\nVi\u1e63\u1e47u's Var\u0101ha or Boar Incarnation.\n\nBeginning as before with the post-Vedic period, we will consider the Pur\u0101nic accounts of this myth first.\n\nThe Bh\u0101gavata Pur\u0101\u1e47a, enumerating twenty-two incarnations of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, says I. 3, 7: 'With a view to the creation of this (universe), the lord of sacrifice, being desirous to raise up the earth, which had sunk into the lower regions, assumed the form of a boar.'\n\nThe Vi\u1e63\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a (I. 4, 1 ff.) relates the same myth to the following effect: 'The divine Brahm\u0101, called N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a, lord of creatures (Praj\u0101pati), discovering by inference that the earth lay within the waters, assumed another form. As he had formerly taken the shape of a fish, a tortoise, etc., so now assuming the form of a boar (v\u0101r\u0101ham vapuh), he entered the water. Then tossing up the earth with his tusk, he raised it, and it rested on the waters without sinking because of its great expansion. Before he raised the earth, P\u1e5bthiv\u012b recognised in him Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, a form of the supreme Brahm\u0101.'\n\nThe R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a in the Bengal edition (II. 119, 3. 4), describing the origin of the world, says: 'All was water only, through which the world was formed. Thence arose Brahm\u0101, the self-existent, the imperishable Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. He, becoming a boar, raised up this earth, and created the whole world.' The Bombay edition in the corresponding passage reads: 'thence arose Brahm\u0101, the self-existent, with the deities,' thus making no mention of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.\u00b9\n\nIn the Linga Pur\u0101\u1e47a, which is a \u015aaiva work, and has, therefore, no interest in magnifying Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, it is simply Brahm\u0101 who is described as becoming a boar (I. 4, 59 ff.): 'In the night when all things movable and immovable had been destroyed in the universal ocean, Brahm\u0101 slept upon the waters, and is called N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a. At the close of the night, awaking and beholding the universe void, Brahm\u0101 resolved to create. Having assumed the form of a boar,\n\n\u00b9 Cp. Muir, IV. pp. 33\u20134.\nthis eternal (god), taking the earth, which was overflowed by the waters, placed it as it had been before.'\n\nTurning to the later Vedic period, we find that the Taittir\u012bya \u0100ra\u1e47yaka (x. i. 8) speaks of the earth having been raised by a black boar with a hundred arms.\u00b9 The boar is not here stated to be a form assumed by any deity, but the attribute satab\u0101hu seems to point to a miraculous or divine character.\n\nIn the Taittir\u012bya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a (I. i. 3, 5 ff.),\u00b2 it is Praj\u0101pati who is described as having in the form of a boar raised the earth. \"This (universe) was formerly water, fluid. With that (water) Praj\u0101pati practised arduous devotion (asr\u0101myat), saying, 'How shall this (universe) be (developed)?' He beheld a lotus-leaf standing. He thought, 'there is something on which this (lotus-leaf) rests.' He as a boar, having assumed (that) form, plunged beneath towards it. He found the earth down below. Breaking off (a piece of) it, he rose to the surface. He then extended it on the lotus-leaf. Inasmuch as he extended it, that is the extension of the extended one\" (the earth).\n\nThe passage of the TS. (VII. i. 5, 1) which the foregoing quotation explains, relates the myth more concisely. 'This universe was formerly water, fluid. On it Praj\u0101pati, becoming wind, moved. He saw this (earth). Becoming a boar, he took it up. Becoming Vi\u015bvakarman, he wiped (the water from) it. It extended. It became the extended one (prthivi).'\n\nThe \u015aB. (XIV. i. 2, 11) states that a boar raised the earth, but does not say anything about his having been a form of Praj\u0101pati. 'Formerly this earth was only so large, of the size of a span. A boar called Em\u016b\u1e63a (em\u016b\u1e63a iti) raised it up.'\u00b3 Its (the earth's) lord Praj\u0101pati therefore,' etc.\n\nThis same boar is again mentioned in the Taittir\u012bya Sa\u1e43hit\u0101, as well as in the corresponding passage of the\n\n\u00b9 Cp. Indische Studien, I. p. 78.\n\u00b2 Cp. Muir, I. p. 53.\n\u00b3 Cp. S'B. III. 9, 4, 20.\nK\u0101\u1e6dhaka, but in these two texts he does not appear in the cosmogonic character in which we have hitherto found him. In the K\u0101\u1e6dhaka his name is expressly stated to be Em\u016b\u1e63a,\\(^1\\) while in the TS, he is described as stealing what is valuable (v\u0101ma-mo\u1e63\u0101\u1e25).\n\nThe myth is related in the TS. (VI. ii. 4, 2\u20133) as follows: \"The sacrifice, assuming the form of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, disappeared from among the gods. He entered the earth. Him the gods, joining hands, searched for. Him Indra passed over above. He (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u) said, 'Who is this who has passed over me above?' (Indra answered), 'I am a slayer in a castle'; then (he asked), 'Who art thou?' (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u replied), 'I am a carrier off from a castle.' He (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u further) said, 'Thou hast said, a slayer in a castle; this boar, the plunderer of wealth (v\u0101ma-mos\u0101\u1e25), keeps the goods (vittam vedyam) of the Asuras on the other side of the seven hills. Slay him if thou art a slayer in a castle.' He (Indra), plucking up a bunch of Ku\u015ba grass and piercing through the seven hills, slew him. He (Indra then) said, 'Thou calledst thyself a carrier off from a castle; carry him off.'\\(^2\\) He (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u), the sacrifice, carried him off as a sacrifice for them.\\(^3\\) Inasmuch as they obtained (avindata) these goods of the Asuras, this is one reason for the altar being called vedi.\"\\(^4\\)\n\nThe same story, with slight variations, is quoted by S\u0101ya\u1e47a, from the Caraka Br\u0101hma\u1e47a,\\(^5\\) in his comment on RV. VIII. 77, 10: \"Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the sacrifice. He hid himself from the gods. The other gods did not find him, but Indra knew (his whereabouts). He said to Indra, 'Who art thou?' To him Indra replied, 'I am the destroyer of castles and Asuras; but who art thou?' He said, 'I am a carrier off from a castle; but if thou art the destroyer of castles and Asuras, then this boar, a plunderer of goods\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Em\u016b\u1e63a n\u0101m\u0101yam var\u0101hah.\n\n\\(^2\\) Tam \u0101lara.\n\n\\(^3\\) Tum ebhyo yaj\u00f1a eva yaj\u00f1am \u0101harat.\n\n\\(^4\\) Cp.

Indra, having broken through those citadels (pura\u1e25) of his, pierced his heart. And what was there, that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u carried off.\"\\(^3\\)\n\nThe important points in the myth related in the last three quotations are the following:\n\n(1) Indra as the slayer and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u as the carrier off are closely associated.\n\n(2) A boar called Em\u016b\u1e63a, the plunderer of wealth (r\u0101ma-mo\u1e63\u0101, v\u0101ma-mu\u1e63a), guards this wealth on the other side of seven hills.\n\n(3) Indra pierces the hills and slays the boar.\n\n(4) Vi\u1e63\u1e47u carries off the goods of the Asuras as a sacrifice for the gods.\n\nLet us now turn to two mutually illustrative passages in the RV., which will prove to be closely connected with the preceding myth.\n\nThe seventh stanza of RV. I. 61, an Indra hymn, runs as follows:\n\n(1) Asyed u m\u0101t\u016b\u1e25 s\u0101vane\u1e63u sady\u014d mah\u0101\u1e25 pitum papic\u0101\u00f1 c\u0101ru \u0101nn\u0101 mu\u1e63\u0101y\u0101d Vi\u1e63\u1e47uh pacat\u0101m, s\u0101hiy\u0101n vidhyad varah\u0101\u1e41 tir\u014d \u0101drim \u0101st\u0101.\n\n'As soon as at the libations of his (Indra\u2019s) mother the great Vi\u1e63\u1e47u had drunk the draught, he stole pleasant food (and) a cooked mess, while the mightier one (Indra) pierced the boar, shooting through the mountain.'\n\n\\(^1\\) Ekavim\u015baty\u0101\u1e25 pur\u0101m p\u0101re \u2019smamayin\u0101m, the identical words of the K\u0101thaka, except that p\u0101re here comes last; cp. RV. IV. 30, 20: \u015batam \u0101\u015bamayin\u0101m pur\u0101m Indro vy\u0101syaet. Weber, in his edition of the TB. (Indische Studien, xi. p. 161), quotes the corresponding passage of the K\u0101thaka as far as the boar is concerned. The version there is: 'this boar, named Em\u016b\u1e63a, remains with all the valuable goods of the Asuras on the other side of twenty-one citadels of stone.'\n\n\\(^2\\) The K\u0101thaka has yat kim c\u0101sur\u0101\u00f1\u0101m v\u0101mam vasu tona tig\u00f1\u0101li.\n\n\\(^3\\) Cp. Muir, IV. pp. 92\u20133.\nThe second passage is the tenth stanza of VIII. 77, also an Indra hymn:\n\n(2) Vi\u015bv\u0113t t\u0101 Vi\u1e63\u1e47ur \u0101bhara\u1e0d\nurukram\u0101s tu\u0113\u015bitah\n\u015bat\u0101\u1e41 m\u0101hi\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 k\u1e63\u012brap\u0101k\u0101\u1e41 odan\u0101m,\nvar\u0101ham I ndra emu\u1e63\u0101m.\n\n\u2018All these things the wide-striding Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, urged by thee (Indra), brought\u2014a hundred buffaloes (and) a brew cooked with milk, while Indra (alew) the fierce boar.\u2019\n\nBefore proceeding to consider these two passages in detail, it is important, for purposes of interpretation, to point out the parallelisms they contain:\n\n(1) maha\u1e25 . . Vi\u1e63\u1e47uh = Vi\u1e63\u1e47ur . . urukrama\u1e25; (2) Asya (Indrasya) m\u0101tu\u1e25 sarane\u1e63u sadyo pitum papi\u1e45\u0101n = tv\u0101-\u012b\u015bitah; (3) mu\u1e63\u0101yat = \u0101bhara\u1e0d; (4) cara ann\u0101, pacatam = \u015batam m\u0101hi\u1e63\u0101\u1e41, k\u1e63\u012brap\u0101kam odanam; (5) sahiy\u0101n = Indra\u1e25; (6) var\u0101ham = var\u0101ham emu\u1e63am; (7) tiro adrim ast\u0101, vidhyat = the omitted verb which governs var\u0101ham emu\u1e63am.\n\nIn (1) the word m\u0101tu\u1e25 has puzzled most interpreters. Roth, Benfey, S\u0101yana, Muir, Griffith assume for this passage a masc. word m\u0101tr, variously supposed to mean \u2018measurer,\u2019 \u2018maker,\u2019 \u2018carpenter,\u2019 and make it agree with asya. Ludwig even emends the word to bhr\u0101tu\u1e25. Both these assumptions are, however, quite unnecessary. The notion of his mother giving Soma to Indra occurs in other passages of the Rigveda. Thus in III. 48, 2. 3 we read: \u2018On the day when thou wast born, thou didst from love of it drink the mountain-grown juice of the Soma-plant. Of old, the youthful mother who bore thee satiated thee with it in the house of thy mighty father. Approaching his mother, he desired sustenance; he beheld the sharp-flavoured Soma on her breast.\u2019 With this may be compared VII. 98, 3: \u2018When born, thou didst drink the Soma-juice to (gain) strength;\nthy mother declared thy greatness';\u00b9 and III. 32, 9. 10:\n'As soon as born thou didst drink the Soma; as soon as\nborn, O Indra, thou didst drink Soma for exhilaration\nin the highest heaven.' It is, therefore, not surprising to\nfind allusion made to his mother's 'pressings' or libations\nof Soma, which Indra drinks to strengthen him for the fray\nwith V\u1e5btra. The notion of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u also having drunk a\ndraught (pitum papiv\u0101n) at these libations is quite in keeping\nwith his association with Indra in the V\u1e5btra fight,\u00b2 and in\nthe drinking of Soma.\u00b3 By asya Indra of course is meant,\nthis being an Indra hymn, all the fifteen verses of which\nbegin with asmai or asya, referring to Indra. I take\nmah\u0101\u1e25, with Grassmann, as a nominative agreeing with\nVi\u1e63\u1e47uh\u2074 (not as a gen. of mah with asya), both owing to its\nposition in the sentence and to its correspondence with\nVi\u1e63\u1e47ur urukramah in (2). The words c\u0101ru ann\u0101 are taken\nby Grassmann and Ludwig as in apposition to pitum, while\nMuir, Griffith, and S\u0101ya\u1e47a supply 'and' (the latter also\nbhak\u1e63itav\u0101n, 'having eaten'). The parallelism of (2) has\ninduced me to connect them with the next p\u0101da\u2075 as\nthe object of mu\u1e63\u0101y\u0101t, c\u0101ru ann\u0101 corresponding to \u015batam\nmah\u0101n and pacatam to k\u1e63irap\u0101kam odanam. S\u0101ya\u1e47a,\nWilson, Benfey, and Grassmann assume an adjectival\nmeaning for vi\u1e63\u1e47u in this passage, making it an epithet\nof Indra. But this assumption is sufficiently refuted\nby the occurrence of the distinctive attribute urukramah\nwith Vi\u1e63\u1e47uh in (2), where Indra is also mentioned in\ncontrast with Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. The two stanzas under consideration\nare the only ones mentioning the name of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u in the\ntwo Indra hymns in which they respectively occur. But\nthere is nothing exceptional in this when these two deities\nare regarded as so closely associated. It would certainly\nbe less exceptional than the single mention of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u in the\n\n\u00b9 Indra's mother is also referred to six or seven times in RV. IV. 18; cp.\nPischel, Vedische Studien, II. pp. 51\u201364.\n\u00b2 RV. VI. 20, 2, etc. (see above, p. 175).\n\u00b3 VI. 69.\n\u2074 In V. 87, 1 (=SV. i. 462) Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is called great (mah\u0113 Vi\u1e63\u1e47ave).\n\u2075 With regard to the sense overriding the caecura, see Pischel, Vedische\nStudien, II. 91, and G\u00f6ttinger gelehrte Anzeigen, 1890, p. 540.\nwhole of the Marut hymn, I. 85.\u00b9 Sahily\u0101n, in connection with what follows, alludes to Indra with sufficient distinctness. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is \u2018great,\u2019 but in the V\u1e5btra fight Indra is \u2018the mightier\u2019; for the slaughter of V\u1e5btra is Indra\u2019s specific deed, while Vi\u1e63\u1e47u figures only as his helper.\u00b2 Here, just as in VI. 68, 3, where Indra and Varu\u1e47a are praised as a dual divinity, the slaughter of V\u1e5btra is attributed to Indra alone. That the two gods were in this myth understood, by the writers of the TS. and TB. passages quoted above, to be performing different acts, is clear from the distinction made between Indra as \u2018the slayer in a castle\u2019 (durge hant\u0101), and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u as \u2018the carrier off from a castle\u2019 (durg\u0101d \u0101hart\u0101).\u00b3\n\nAgain, the comparison of another verse of the RV. shows that it is Vi\u1e63\u1e47u who steals the food\u2014100 buffaloes in (2). Thus in VI. 17, 11 we read, \u2018P\u016b\u1e63an Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2074 cooked 100 buffaloes for thee, O Indra; three lakes ran V\u1e5btra-slaying exhilarating Soma-juice for him\u2019 (Indra).\u2075\n\nBut what reason have we to suppose that the V\u1e5btra-fight is here alluded to? There is a general presumption that it is referred to in I. 61, 7, because both the preceding and the following stanza mention it. The sixth stanza speaks of Indra\u2019s bolt \u2018by which he found the vitals of V\u1e5btra\u2019;\u2076 and in the eighth stanza the wives of the gods sing the praises of Indra on the slaughter of the dragon (ahihatye). Moreover, the words of the fourth line in our seventh stanza can easily be shown to refer to the V\u1e5btra-fight. In X. 99, 6, where Indra is described as slaying the\n\n\u00b9 Cp. Max M\u00fcller, Vedic Hymns, SBE. vol. xxxii. p. 134.\n\u00b2 RV. VI. 20, 2; I. 156, 4, 5; I. 22, 19.\n\u00b3 Both \u015a\u0101ya\u1e47a and Ludwig, on the strength of the distinction made in TS. VI. ii. 4, 2, 3, understand sahiy\u0101n to mean Indra.\n\u2074 The collocation P\u016b\u1e63an Vi\u1e63\u1e47u occurs also in RV. I. 90, 5; V. 46, 3; VI. 21, 9; VII. 44, 1; X. 66, 5. Cp. VII. 35, 9.\n\u2075 P\u016b\u1e63an oha/dm mahi\u1e25p\u0101n Indra, tibhyam P\u016b\u1e63a Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, trij\u012b edr\u0101mei dh\u0101van v\u1e5btraha\u1e47am madir\u0101m am\u015bum asm\u0101i. In V. 29, 7 it is Agni, Indra\u2019s great ally, who performs a similar service: \u2018Agni for his friend cooked 300 buffaloes, and Indra for V\u1e5btra\u2019s slaughter drank three lakes of pressed Soma; and Indra, after eating the flesh of the 300 buffaloes and drinking the three lakes, slew the dragon.\u2019 Cp. also RV. X. 27, 2; 28, 3; 86, 14. Indra is thus a great eater as well as a great drinker.\n\u2076 Vajram . . v\u1e5btrdeya cid vid\u0101d y\u0113na indrma.\nthree-headed, six-eyed demon, the god Trita, strengthened by Indra's might, slays the boar\\(^1\\) with iron-pointed shaft.\\(^2\\) And in the 11th stanza of I. 121, an Indra hymn, there can be no mistake about the boar being V\u1e5btra: 'Thou, great (god), slewest with the bolt the boar V\u1e5btra, who kept guard over the streams.'\\(^3\\) The words *tir\u014d adrim \u0101\u015b\u0101d*, 'shooting through or across the mountain,' is quite in keeping with the mythological language employed in describing the fight with the aerial demons. Thus Indra slays the dragon lying on the mountain,\\(^4\\) or strikes \u015aambara down from the mountain,\\(^5\\) while in another passage\\(^6\\) we read: 'The mighty unmoved rock (*adrim*), which encompassed the cows,\\(^7\\) thou didst force from its place, O Indra.' But the meaning of the passage is perhaps best brought out by the sixth stanza of VIII. 77, which occurs in the same hymn as (2): 'Indra shot forth from the mountains\u2014he gained the ripe brew\u2014his well-aimed arrow.'\\(^8\\) The meaning of this verse S\u0101ya\u1e47a explains thus: 'He struck the clouds in order to make water come out, producing ripe brew for men.' Here *pakr\u0101m odan\u0101m* is clearly the same as *k\u1e63irap\u0101k\u0101m odan\u0101m* in (2) and *pacat\u0101m* in (1).\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See my article on Trita, J.R.A.S., 1893, pp. 430\u20131.\n\n\\(^2\\) *Vipa var\u0101h\u0101m dyoagray\u0101 han.* Bergaigne, *Religion V\u00e9dique*, I. p. vii. note, would render 'with iron-pointed prayer,' but this is too far-fetched.\n\n\\(^3\\) *Te\u1e63\u0101m V\u1e5btr\u0101m \u0101\u015b\u0101y\u0101nam \u015b\u012br\u1e63\u0101n mah\u0101 vejrena s\u012bvap\u0101 varahum.* In X. 99, 6 (quoted above) the boar is clearly identical with the three-headed demon. Besides here and in I. 61, 7, VIII. 77, 10, *var\u0101\u1e25* occurs four times and *var\u0101\u1e25u* once in the RV. In X. 28, 4 it is used in the literal sense; in LX. 97, 7 Soma, rushing to the vats, is compared with a boar; lightnings, probably as tearing up the ground (cp. Zimmer, AIL. p. 86), are called boars in X. 67, 7 ('Brahma\u1e47as pati, with boars glowing with sweat, obtained the treasure' = the cows of Papi) and in I. 88, 6 (the golden-wheeled, iron-tusked boars rushing hither and thither on the path of the Maruts); and in I. 114, 5 the terrible god Rudra is called the 'ruddy boar of heaven' (*div\u014d var\u0101h\u0101m ar\u016b\u1e0dim*), perhaps lightning in its destructive aspect.\n\n\\(^4\\) *Pervata*, I. 32, 2.\n\n\\(^5\\) I. 30, 7; IV. 30, 14; VI. 26, 5; cp. Muir, V. p. 97.\n\n\\(^6\\) VI. 17, 5.\n\n\\(^7\\) *Pari g\u0113h sauntam.*\n\n\\(^8\\) *Nir \u0101\u015bidhyad giribhya \u0101\u2014dh\u0101r\u0101yat pakv\u0101m odandm\u2014Indro bund\u0101m vid\u0101tam.*\nWe have still to consider a few points in (2). This stanza occurs in an Indra hymn, which in general celebrates the might of Indra's weapons, and his vast powers of drinking Soma.\n\n'All these things' (visr\u0101 it t\u0101) is explained in the third line to mean 'one hundred buffaloes and the brew of milk.' It is at the instigation of Indra that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u brings the hundred buffaloes. That they are the property of V\u1e5btra is indicated by mu\u1e63\u0101y\u0101t in (1). Pacat\u0101m is explained by S\u0101ya\u1e47a as paripakvam asur\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 dhanam. It probably alludes ultimately to the 'ripe' milk of the cows (=clouds) obstructed by V\u1e5btra. Milk itself is often spoken of as 'ripe,' and as having been placed in the 'raw' cows by Indra. Tc\u0101-\u012bsitah is used because Indra in the previous stanza is addressed in the second person with te. Muir and Grassmann translate I'ndra\u1e25 with 'O Indra,' and understand var\u0101h\u0101m to be governed by \u0101bh\u0101rat. Ludwig and Griffith, supplying \u0101bh\u0101rat from the first line, take the meaning to be, 'Indra brought a boar.' The comparison of the fourth line in (1) shows that S\u0101ya\u1e47a is right in supplying some such verb as avidhyat, 'pierced,' or hanti, 'slays.' The \u1f00\u03c0\u03b1\u03be \u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd emu\u1e63\u0101m has with great plausibility been explained by Roth (with whom Grassmann and Ludwig agree) as the perfect participle with weak base (and its accent) in place of em-i-v\u0101msam, from the root am,\n\n1 Thus in v. 3 he is described as having drunk thirty lakes of Soma at a single draught.\n2 Cp. I. 168, 4, where Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, accompanied by his friend (i.e. Indra), opens the stable (of the cows).\n3 The same root is used in RV. III. 48, 4, where Indra is said, after overcoming Tva\u1e63\u1e6d\u1e5b and appropriating (\u0101-mu\u1e63ya) his Soma, to have drunk it. This seems to indicate that Tva\u1e63\u1e6d\u1e5b withheld the Soma from Indra (who, as Bergaigne, Religion V\u00e9dique, III. 58, shows, was his son), and thus incurred the latter's hostility. Cp. Vedische Studien, II. p. 51.\n4 Eg. in I. 62, 9.\n5 Cp. Val. 4, 3, where Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is said to have taken his three strides for Indra, and VIII. 12, 27, where he is said to have taken them by the energy (g\u0101s\u0101) of Indra.\n6 S\u0101ya\u1e47a's explanation is that, by a Vedic substitution of e for \u0101, emu\u1e63\u0101m stands for \u0101mu\u1e63am=udakasya mopsakam (\u0101mu\u1e63am presumably therefore=\u0101m-mu\u1e63am for \u0101p-mu\u1e63am). In the TB. passage, quoted above, the boar is spoken of as a v\u0101ma-mopd, and in the TB. as v\u0101ma-mu\u1e63a. These epithets suggest that emu\u1e63\u0101m was understood to contain the root mu\u1e63, 'to steal.' The K\u0101\u1e6dhaka and the S'B. have, as we have seen, the corrupt form emu\u1e63a.\n'to be destructive,' with the contraction of the root, otherwise found only in the case of medial \\(a\\) (as in ten- from \\(Vtan\\)). This explanation is supported by a few other accusatives, which show the weak base instead of the strong: cakr\u016b\u1e63am (RV. I. 137, 1; AV. IV. 13, 1) and pros\u016b\u1e63am (SB. XII. v. 2, 8).\n\nS\u0101ya\u1e47a explains the general meaning of (2)\\(^1\\) to be: 'After Indra had slain the boar, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, requested by Indra to bring his (the Asura Var\u0101ha's) property (\\(v\u0101mam\\) vasu), plundered it.'\n\nAfter making the foregoing comments, we can now state the combined purport of our two stanzas thus:\u2014'Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, having drunk Soma, and, urged by Indra, carried off the property of the boar (=the demon of drought), i.e. cattle and milk (=clouds and rain), while Indra himself, shooting across the (aerial) mountain, slew the boar.'\n\nThis myth, if analyzed, yields the following essential elements:\n\n1. Indra and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u are closely associated, the former as slayer, the latter as carrier off of spoil.\n2. A boar, with the epithet \\(emusa\\), is on the other side of a mountain with his property.\n3. Indra shoots across the mountain and slays the boar.\n4. Vi\u1e63\u1e47u carries off the property of the boar.\n\nThe traits of the myth as related in the TS. and the TB. are practically identical with these. The only modification introduced is that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, as the sacrifice, carries off everything belonging to the Asuras, including the boar, as a sacrifice for the gods. Thus, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u as the sacrifice, bringing the boar as a sacrifice, here already becomes mystically identified with the boar. In this connection it is of importance to observe that this story in TS. VI. ii. 4, 2, is immediately followed by that in which Indra assumes\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This stanza is commented on in Nirukta, V. 4, where the etymology of var\u0101ha (=megha) is given as \\(va\\); \\(a\\)-\u0101h\u0101ra, 'bringing boons.'\nthe form of a she-jackal, in order to take three strides, and thus gain the earth from the Asuras.\n\nIn a subsequent passage of the TS. (VII. i. 5, 1), the boar also appears, as we have seen, in a cosmogonic character, as a form, not of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, but of the supreme being Praj\u0101pati (as in the tortoise myth above), when the latter desires to raise the submerged earth.\n\nFurther, the boar which raised the earth is in \u015aB. XIV. i. 2, 11 named Em\u016b\u1e63a, and in TA. X. i. 8 it is said to be black, and to have a hundred arms; though in neither of these two passages is it described as being the form of a god.\n\nIn the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a it is Brahm\u0101 or Vi\u1e63\u1e47u who assume the form of a boar, while in the Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava Pur\u0101\u1e47as it is, of course only Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.\n\nIn this myth therefore we find Vi\u1e63\u1e47u and the boar connected from the beginning, but they are at first quite distinct. It is, however, only after the destructive (emu\u1e63a) boar, the baleful V\u1e5btra, slain by Indra in association with Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, had developed into the cosmogonic boar, Em\u016b\u1e63a, that it became capable of further developing into one of the recognised incarnations of the Preserver Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.\n\nThus we see that when the doctrine of the Avat\u0101rs of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u became established in Hinduism through the fusion with him of the popular deity K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a,\u00b9 four mythological conceptions derived from the Veda were ready to be appropriated as incarnations of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u in his character of Preserver and Benefactor of the world.\n\nIt is quite possible that primitive beliefs, excluded from the more refined sacerdotal poetry of the Rigveda, but surviving in popular Aryan tradition, or borrowed by the latter from the aborigines, may have helped to vitalize some of the animal myths connected with Vi\u1e63\u1e47u. Thus a widely diffused feature of savage cosmogonies is a belief in the creation of the world, or in the recovery of a submerged earth, by animals, such as the coyote, the raven, and the\n\n\u00b9 Cp. Barth, Religions of India, p. 166.\ndove.\\(^1\\) However this may be, it seems clear from the above investigation that the origin and development of the Dwarf and Boar myths connected with Visnu are to be found within the compass of the literature of the Veda itself.\n\n\\(^1\\) Cp.

He also presented a volume of Sanskrit and Prakrit Inscriptions, published under the auspices of the Maharaja of Bhaunagar.\" Dr. Burgess read a paper on \"Transliteration of Oriental Alphabets.\"\n\nOn the proposal of Dr. Grierson a resolution was passed by the Section thanking the Directors of the Indian Museum, Calcutta, for their work in preparing casts of the Asoka Inscriptions, and requesting the Governments of India and of dependent States to adopt measures for the better preservation of the Inscriptions.\n\nMr. Bhownaggree asked, in the name of Mr. Kama, that the Section should take into consideration the methods of examination employed in the Bombay University with regard to the Zend language. A Sub-Committee was formed to consider the question; and on the report submitted by it to the Section it was resolved that it would not be wise to interfere, but that an expression of hope be made that the study of Zend would not be overlooked, and that a practical way of teaching it in connection with the University curriculum would be found.\n\nSection IA.

A large company assembled at the Palais Eynard on Tuesday evening, the 4th, at the invitation of the Council of the State, and were entertained with excellent music, illuminations, and refreshments. On Thursday, the 6th, a tour of the Lake with luncheon at Bouveret had been arranged, but the weather being bad in the morning, the luncheon was given in the Palais Eynard, and the trip on the Lake postponed until the afternoon, and then shortened to a tour round the western part of the Lake as far as Evian. On the evening of Tuesday, the 11th, a dinner was given by the city authorities to the Delegates and Representatives of Societies and Governments in the 'foyer' of the Theatre, after which the guests passed through the prettily illuminated grounds of the Promenade des Bastions to the Palais Eynard, where the rest of the Members of the Congress and a considerable company were assembled. The Count de Gubernatis here\nmade a brilliant speech in praise of the city of Geneva and of the lady visitors. The President and Madame Naville received the Members of the Congress at their house at Malagny on the 5th; the Mesdames Van Berchem, at Crans, on the 8th; and Monsieur and Madame Ag\u00e9nor Boissier, at Chougny, on the 11th. Special trains were furnished to convey the guests, and entertainment, music, and refreshments were provided in hospitable profusion. Unfortunately the weather was bad on two of the days and prevented the full enjoyment of the beautiful gardens and views at these charming chateaux. Several other ladies and gentlemen entertained parties of the members at their houses on other evenings.\n\nThe closing meeting was held in the Great Hall on the morning of Wednesday, the 12th, under the presidency of M. Naville. Prof. Maspero announced to the members the death of the great Egyptologist, H. Brugseh Pacha, which was received with deep regret by all.\n\nThe Committee on Transliteration presented their report. The system they proposed will be published with the Proceedings of the Congress, and be recommended for adoption by all Orientalists.\n\nThe Committee appointed to consider the question of the preservation of the monuments of Phil\u00e6 presented their report, upon which it was resolved that \"The tenth Congress of Orientalists consider that they are fulfilling a duty in requesting the Government of His Highness the Khedive to protect the edifices and monuments on the Island of Phil\u00e6.\"\n\nThe following resolutions, passed by some of the Sections, were also read and adopted:\n\n\"That the Trustees of the Indian Museum at Calcutta, and the Government of India, be thanked in the name of the Congress for the efforts they are making for the preparation of casts of the Asoka Inscriptions. And that through the Government of India the Native States be urged in the name of the Congress to protect the Inscriptions.\"\n\n\"That the Congress recognizes the great importance to\nPhilology of the 'Orientalischer Bibliographie,' instituted by the late Dr. Aug. M\u00fcller.\"\n\n\"That it is desirable the Japanese should modify their written character so that the language might be more easily acquired.\"\n\n\"That the Congress hope the study of the Zend language will not be overlooked by the University of Bombay, and that a practical way of teaching it will be found.\"\n\nSection VI. Greece and the East expressed their thanks to the Congress for the place assigned to it among the Sections.\n\nProf. Goldziher called attention to the proposition adopted at the Ninth Congress on the subject of the compilation of an Oriental Encyclopaedia. Section III. had appointed Prof. Goldziher President of that Committee in the place of the late Prof. Robertson Smith.\n\nThe President then announced the decision of the Committee of Organization that the next Congress be held at Paris in 1897.\n\nProf. A. Martin, rector of the University, made a farewell speech on behalf of the Committee of the Congress, which was followed by one from the President concluding the proceedings.\n\nProf. J. Karabacek, of Austria, Kiamil Bey, of Turkey, Prof. Tiele, of Holland, and Prof. Joy, of America, then spoke, proposing a hearty vote of thanks to the President, which was carried by acclamation. The President replied in a few words, and then pronounced the Congress closed.\n\nM. E. V. C.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n\n1. Relics Found in Rangoon.\n\nSir,\u2014At pp. 298\u2013308 of Vol. XVII. of the Society's Journal, for 1860, there is an account of some relics which were taken out of a temple (stupa?) which was demolished when the site was being cleared for the European barracks in Rangoon in the year 1855.\n\nThey consisted of\u2014\n\n1. A large gold pagoda.\n2. A smaller one.\n3. Parts of one that was still smaller.\n4. A gold helmet or cap of State.\n5. A gold tassel.\n6. A gold bowl, with cover, containing parts of human cremated bones.\n7. A small gold cup.\n8. A gold leaf scroll, on which there was an inscription.\n9. A gold waist belt.\n\nMost of these articles, which are of considerable value, are now exhibited in a case at South Kensington. There is a copy of the inscription in the Journal, but, on enquiry at the South Kensington Museum, it appears that the scroll itself is not to be found. The inscription is in Pali, and was translated at the time by Professor Fausb\u00f6ll, and it is curious to note that the supposed translation made in Rangoon by, or under the orders of, Major Sparks, is not in any way a translation of the scroll submitted to Professor Fausb\u00f6ll.\nMajor Sparks' translation begins thus: \"In the year 846 (A.D. 1484-5) the King and I built a pagoda,\" etc., etc. In a note Major Sparks remarks: \"Neither the name of the king or queen is given in the inscription. A reference to Talaing history shows that in 846 Pinya Kyaula was King of Pegu.\" It is perfectly true that there is no definite name in the inscription, but neither is there a date: how then did Major Sparks fix it at B.C. 846?\n\nOn referring to Phayre's History, I find that Dhammaceti was King of Pegu at that date. I can find no such king as Pinya Kyaula anywhere. The inscription terms the King \"R\u00e1jar\u00e1j\u00e1, Sabbar\u00e1jissaror\u00e1j\u00e1\" and \"Sabbar\u00e1jindo sattum\u00e1tangakesar\u00ed,\" and states that he is Kupati, the son of Setebhissara. Kupati, Professor Fausb\u00f6ll thought, might be the same as Bhupati (earth lord), but Professor Rhys Davids is inclined to think it a proper name.\n\nThere are no such names as Kupati or Setebhissara in Phayre's lists, but they may have been titles of some of the Kings of Pegu, though not generally used. If it were not for the general correctness of the spelling on the scroll, I should have suggested that Setebhissara was a mistake for Setibhissara, \"Lord of the white elephant.\" This title was used for King Binya U, who reigned from A.D. 1348 to 1385, and was succeeded by his son Binya Nw\u00e8, commonly known as R\u00e1jadirit (R\u00e1jadhir\u00e1j\u00e1). According to Phayre (p. 67), this king \"took possession of Dagun, now Rangoon, and engaged the services of some Western foreigners.\" . . . He was successful in his wars with Burma, and after the decease of Min Khaung, his enemy, devoted his latter years to religion.\n\nIt is quite possible that Setebhissara is the Peguan corruption of Setibhissara and equivalent to the Burmese word \"Shinbyushin.\" Professor Fausb\u00f6ll thought it might mean \"Ruler of the Setebha,\" but I cannot connect this word with any people.\n\nHis supposition that these relics belonged to Alompra is founded on a misconception. The relics were not \"found by digging among the ruins of the famous temple\nat Rangoon,\" but on a hill about a quarter of a mile distant from it.\n\nThe workmanship of the belt is, I think, far superior to anything in the Burmese regalia, and the helmet or cap of State most remarkable and unlike anything that is Burmese. It is shaped like a large snail shell or turban with a kind of loop behind, and a hole in front into which I would insert the tassel of flowers.\n\nAs regards the character in which the scroll is written, Professor Fausb\u00f6ll remarked: \"It cannot be old, because the characters do not differ much from those now in use among the Burmese.\" With all due deference to so high an authority, I see essential differences, especially in the form of R, which in modern Burmese is \u0398, but in this inscription \u03a3, almost identical with the Kambodian \u03a3.\n\nFrom the Po-u-daung inscription, given in the Indian Antiquary of 1893, by Taw Sein Ko, it appears that there was an old Burmese form, \u0398, somewhat similar; but it is not clear that this form was generally used in Burma, and may have been used on this occasion by a Peguan mason. I notice that the general character of the letters is nearer the Kambodian as given by Frankfurter than it is to Burmese.\n\nThe term \"Sattum\u00e1tangakesari,\" if correctly translated, would apply quite as well to R\u00e1j\u00e1dirit as to Alompra\u2014perhaps better.\n\nI think the matter is well worthy of investigation, and hope some of our members in Burma will make further enquiries.\u2014Yours faithfully,\n\nR. F. St. Andrew St. John.\n\nJuly 27th, 1894.\n\nTo the Secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n2. Sanskrit MSS. in China.\n\nSir,\u2014On reading Professor Kielhorn's interesting letter on \"Sanskrit Manuscripts in China,\" I remembered what I meant to do when I saw it first in the Academy of June 16th, 1894, namely, to say that many years ago Prof. Wilson showed me in the Library of the old East India House the MS. of the K\u0101lachakra, which he had received from China. My impression is that it was not a copy, but an original, kept in a small wooden case; but of that I am not quite certain. Anyhow, whether original or copy, the MS. must exist in the Library of the India Office, and might prove useful for comparison with the MS. photographed by Dr. A. O. Franke in the Buddhist monastery in the mountains of T'ien-t'ai-shan.\n\nOxford, 18th Oct. 1894. F. Max M\u00fcller.\n\n3. An Indo-Eranian Parallel.\n\nSir,\u2014It is only since my return from vacation that I have been able to read through the July number of the Journal, and in so doing I have been struck by a passage on p. 559, in Prof. Macdonell's letter upon the Brhaddevat\u0101, wherein he corrects his former translation of three verses into the following:\n\n\"Then Agni, well-pleased, rejoicing, honoured by all the gods, shaking off his members, unweariedly performed the office of Hotr at sacrifices, accompanied by his brethren, rejoicing, the divine-souled oblation-bearer. His bone (was=) became the Devad\u0101ru tree, (his) fat and flesh (became) bdellium, (his) sinew (became) the fragrant tejana grass, (his) semen (became) silver and gold, the hair of (his) body (became) k\u0101\u00e7a grass, the hair of (his) head (became) ku\u00e7a grass, and (his) nails (became) tortoises, (his) entrails (became) the avak\u0101 plant, (his) marrow (became) sand and gravel, (his) blood and bile (became) various minerals, such as red chalk.\"\nThe characteristic idea of this curious passage is the production of vegetable and mineral substances (with the one odd exception of \"tortoises\"), from the various portions of a human frame.\n\nThis strange idea has its echo in Eranian tradition. In this we find two primeval beings, a man (Avestic, Gayamaretan, Pehlevi, G\u00e2y\u00f4mart) and an ox. These were both eventually slain by Aharman (Ahriman), the Evil principle, and out of their bodies were produced the other creatures of the animal, vegetable, and mineral worlds. Thus, from the limbs of the primeval man, G\u00e2y\u00f4mart, were produced the seven metals, viz. silver, iron, brass, tin, lead, quicksilver, and adamant; but gold, on account of its excellence, from his life and semen (Z\u00e2d Sparam, x. 2). And from the body of the primeval ox were produced various vegetables: from the marrow, divers species of grain and medicinal plants; from the horns, peas; from the nose, the leek; from the lungs, rue; from the middle of the heart, thyme; from the blood, the vine, from which wine is made (B\u00fbn-dehesh, xiv. 1, 2).\n\nThe differences in the two accounts is striking enough\u2014indeed the solitary agreement seems to be in the derivation of gold from animal semen\u2014but the similarity of the general underlying idea appears to me still more remarkable. For this reason I venture to call attention to it in your columns.\u2014Yours, etc.,\n\nL. C. Casartelli.\n\nSt. Bede's College, Manchester,\nOct. 16th, 1894.\n\n4. \"Bud, Bad-\u0101-r, and Madra\" (see Parts July and October, 1894, of the Journal).\n\nDear Sir,\u2014I intended the following paper as an explanation of the important subject of the Bud, Budr, and Madra, regarding which correspondence was invited in the July number of our Journal. I send the paper\nnow as one likely to prove of some general interest, for the subject is large, ancient, and widely ramified, and its real basis is not touched upon in the replies given in the current October issue, though Mr. Beames hints at this when he says: \"These tutelary spirits . . . of non-Aryan aborigines have survived . . . Hinduism and . . . Isl\u0101m . . . The numerous P\u012brs or Saints whom Hindu and Musulman alike reverence are in all probability only the animistic spirits transformed\" (italics mine). No doubt: therefore we may rest assured that the Bad, Badr, or Budr of the dangerous reef covering the Aky\u0101b harbour, and the Madra of the Mergui coast, is the real \"old animistic\" spirit or god whom we have to trace to his home in many lands; and that he never was \"a resident of Chitagong in 1440 called Bad-ruddin!\" as suggested by Dr. Wise in the extract Mr. Beveridge gives, p. 841. Most holy men claimed or were called after divinities, as a Jerem-i\u0101h, Jer-i\u0101h, or Jerial, after Jahv\u0113; or a Nicholus after Nik, Nik-or, Nykr, Niklaus, etc.; and Badra and Madra are vastly ancient divine terms which we find interspersed throughout all India, mythologically, geographically, and socially, in family and tribal names.\u2014Yours truly,\n\nJ. G. R. Forlong.\n\n5.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014Information is invited by Major Temple and Mr. St. John regarding a quasi \"Burmese Saint,\" known as \"Badar, Budder, and Madra,\" whose shrines or sacred rocks are found on the \u0100rak\u0101n coast and in the Mergui Archipelago, and who is thought to be connected with the divine sage G\u014dtama Buddha\u2014now universally revered, if not worshipped, throughout these Burmese provinces: see Journal of July last.\n\nKnowing the particular rocks and localities, of which indeed I possess sketches, I have no hesitation in saying\nthat the rock-bound god of Aky\u0101b and elsewhere, is our old friend the Bud-k\u0101l or B\u0101d-\u0101-k\u0101l, the Bod or \"Bad-stone,\" common in the villages of Southern and Central India, and not rare in Upper and Himalayan India. I have seen and studied his characteristics in the fastnesses of Lower Kail\u0101sa and near to Ked\u0101r-N\u0101th\u2014a shrine and form of Bhairava the Turanian Siva.\n\nHe has nothing whatever to do with \"The Buddha\" or pious ascetic, though the old god did, no doubt, greatly facilitate the progress and popularity of the new saint amid all Turanian populations, where these were devoid of any etymological knowledge, except that which appealed to their uneducated ears and fancies.\n\nI have visited and carefully investigated the histories and surroundings of several of the B\u014d-d\u0101s, Bad-\u0101-s, or Bud-\u0101-rs, as natives thus reverently drawl out the names of these Burmese deities or daimons, besides the one on the dangerous rocks at the entrance of the Aky\u0101b harbour, where he represents the guardian as well as a destructive spirit. Further down this \u0100rak\u0101n coast, I had serious experience of another Bod-\u0101-r or Bud on the islet of Ched\u016bba, and was nearly wrecked on a third\u2014the dread spirit at the mouth of the Sandoway river\u2014owing to my Muslim Kal\u0101s\u012bs (Chitagongis) falling on their knees to pray, instead of standing by the rudder and halyards in a stiff breeze and seven-knot current, as we swept round his rocky headland.\n\nOn the Tenasserim coast I have seen Bud-\u0101-s from the mouths of the Tavoy river to that of Krau; and near our civil station of Mergui is one often called Mudra, a favourite Tamil name for the old Dravidian Siva. I have also seen inland-mountain Bud-as, as that on the lofty, bold, rocky crest of Kaiktyo overlooking the broad delta of the Sitang and Biling rivers, which will be found illustrated and described in \"Rivers of Life,\" ii. 314.\n\nThe various rites and sacrifices of these Bud-\u0101-rs used to require human victims, as noticed by Arabian travellers of the ninth century (Renaudot, p. 88), and not as now\nonly goats, cocks, rice, fruits, and flowers. These are still offered to the deity by most rude Indian peoples and by the coast tribes and peasantry of Arakan, Burma, Tenasserim, Siam, Java, Bali, and the Cochin-Chinese peninsula. We see the god in the Javan Boro-Bod-d-r, that is \"Ancient Bodr,\" of about 600 A.C. There he existed long before Buddhist monks here reared their beautiful shrine over this, his conical rock. Still around its base and the adjoining hills, well named Probo-lingo, stand many of his symbolic Men-hirs, as the histories of Crawfurd and Sir S. Raffles show.\n\nUsually he was and is a \"Wrathful and Terrible One,\" like to Bhairava, but with also the characteristics of Fortuna\u2014Jove of our Fates,\" the Pur or Fiery God of high Pra-nest\u0113 or Pur-hesti, the guardian Agni of the Volscian capital of Tyr-rhenian Antium, before the Latins knew him as Iova Virilis, a god of Sortes, Purim, or Lots.\n\nThere also he was enshrined by Turanians, then the rulers of the Western seas, on the highest peak of the Alban range, as the L\u0101rs or L\u0101 (Mongolic for \"spirit\") of the vasty deep; as he to whom their mariners must look, on approaching this low-lying dangerous coast. His also is the Peak of Ceylon, as well as of the ruined temple spire on the low-lying islet at the treacherous entrance of the Siam river, where still stands his emblem in the neglected enclosure of an ancient Sivaite shrine.\n\nHe is found throughout China, especially in the upper reaches of the Yang-tse-kiang, at one of the sources of which, on the high mountain of O or Om, is one of his most ancient prehistoric shrines and \"tooth\" symbols. He is seen in all the Obs or O-bo-s of Mongolia, and even on the rock-bound Haugs of Scandinavia, from which have been gathered the coarse \"Buds\" seen in the Bergen Museum and learnedly described by the late Director, Prof. Holmboe, in his Traces de Budhieme en Norvege. This writer, too, has made the usual mistake of confounding the old Nature-god and \"spirit of the elements\"\nwith the pious ascetic of B\u00f6d-a-Gay\u0101\u2014see details and illustration in \"Rivers of Life,\" ii. 409 et seq.\n\nAncient Sabean sailors called Lanka's peak the Al-makar; Buddhists, the lord Sam\u0101nto Kuto, which Hindus, however, say signifies \"the thorn of K\u0101ma\" as Sam\u0101nta, \"the destroyer of peace\"\u2014a form of Siva, Indra, Sakra, or Bhogi. The indenture on the Kuta is a Sri-Pad or \"The Ineffable Foot, ray or shaft,\" says Fergusson; and the whole great cone is, or was, in the language of the masses, a Bud, Bod, or Madr\u0101\u2014that familiar and kindly name which they have ever applied to village B\u00f6d-a-k\u0101ls or \"Bad-stones\" as emblems of Madra or Siva.\n\nThese are common throughout Tel-ling\u0101na and Southern and Central India, where Mr. Fawcett found them as abundant in 1890 as I did some forty years ago. He describes them, their worship, and some of the cruel rites and sacrifices in Bom. Anthro. Soc. Jour. of September, 1890; but so little is the cult understood, that even the learned Bishop Caldwell often calls it \"Devil-worship,\" confusing it with that of Bhuts. And, truly, B\u00f6ds or Buds do naturally tend to become these malevolent spirits of earth and air, trees, etc., as did Devas to become devils; the high gods or N\u0101ths of Hindus to be the N\u0101ts or Faye of trans-India; and as does the Mongolian and Russian Bh\u0101g or B\u014dg, to become the Bogey of our nurseries. Yet this last is a very real and ancient god, none other than the original of Bhaga-vat or Bhaga-v\u0101, \"The Supreme,\" \"the God of Life and of all Spirits,\" for \"v\u0101 is the elemental spirit by which all exist, and which exists in all that lives,\" according to the Vishnu Pur\u0101\u1e47a, vi. 5.\n\nIt would seem as if the geological centre of a land ever became also its theological Olumpos; for the high \"centre of the Jewel-India\" is the Bud or Mah\u0101deva of Gondw\u0101na, as is the \"Adam's peak\" of Ceylon; the snowy heights of Om, that of China; the Ilium, that of Trojans; and the Ida, that of Cyprians. The deity is the spirit of life and destruction\u2014the spirit of the storm, of the rock-bound coast, of the dangerous defile, dark forest, weird\nmountain, and angry flood; and must be \"layed\" or propitiated at the most dreaded spots, whether the traveller or sailor be Buddhist, Hindu, or Muslam. Not infrequently have we thrown to him a rupee, or subscribed for cock or goat, at the solicitation of our motley following of Burmans, Tamils, Telingas, etc., beseeching his godship to let us pass scatheless through his angry seas and river-torrents.\n\nMany great gods are still called Bhut-Ivars or \"Spirit-lords\"; and I have found Indra worshipped among Dr\u0101vids at the Pong\u0101l Christmas festival, as B\u014dg or Bh\u014dg\u012b, when he represents the sun rising from his wintry entombment. It was probably at this f\u00eate that the Arabian travellers of the ninth century saw \"girls being devoted to B\u014dd,\" as Renaudot wrote in 1733; and the rite still continues in the jangals of Central India, wherever our Magistrates are not numerous or vigilant enough.\n\nStrictly speaking, M\u0101dra was a son of the Dravidian Siva; but Tamils fondly identify father and son, and call their boys and girls Madra and Madri. The name is very common from M\u0101dra-patanam (our \"town of M\u0101dr\u0101s\") and eastwards to Burma and Java; hence Major Temple's remark, that on the Mergui coast he found the Bud-\u0101-r Mak\u0101ms were also called \"Madra Mak\u0101ms.\"\n\nThe M\u0101dr\u0101s were a very ancient and important people, ruling long before Aryan times, from S\u0101kala on the Dud\u0101s of the Biy\u0101s and Chin\u0101b, still called M\u0101dra-d\u0113s. They were serpent-worshippers, as N\u0101ga-ists and T\u0101kas (a cult they never forsook in Dravidia, Ceylon, or trans-India), as the beautiful sculptures of Boro-Bud-or (the Javan \"Ancient Bud\") and the N\u0101g-on V\u0101t or \"N\u0101ga Monastery\" of Kam-bod-ia attest. In moving from N.W. India they gave their name to many towns, rivers, and shrines, from probably M\u0101th\u016bra to the Vindhyas, M\u0101dura and M\u0101dra-patan, as may be gathered from Mr. J. F. Hewitt's invaluable researches in our Journals, R.A.S. of 1889\u201390.\n\nMost Bud or Bod rocks and symbols are marked with the euphemistic \"Foot,\" \"Eyes,\" or circles, as infallible\ncharms against evil. Hence the Pra-Bat of Siam and similar \"Sacred Feet\" on the Buds of Aky\u0101b and Ceylon, and the oval or Yoni Charm on Kaiktyo.\n\nChinese sailors have always recognized the Ceylon Peak as the Fo or Bod of Avalokit-Isvara and Kwanyon in the form Po-taraka or Po-lo-yu, which last is also an ancient Turanian name of P\u0101rvat\u012b as \"the Mountain Bee goddess Br\u0101hmari.\" (See Professor Beale's paper in R.A.S. Journal, XV. iii. July, 1883). This divine name, Po-lo-yu, is also given to the sacred temple-crowned cone of Lh\u0101sa in Tibet, and to that equally holy and higher Zion of Buddhists (really Bod-ists?), the snowy apex, O or Om of the Szi-chouen range, (See Mr. Consul Hosie's report, Chinese Bluebook ii.)\n\nThe Palla-dium of this shrine of Om (a term which partakes of the quintessence of divinity) is also a \"tooth\" of Bod, Bud, or \"Buddha,\" as his votaries quaintly affirm; for \"it is 20lb. weight,\" and therefore clearly a lingam\u2014like to the Ban\u0101ras Danda of Bhairava the Turanian Siva, whose name is Dant\u014dn or the \"tooth-like one.\" He has many canine or hybodont symbols. There are two in Western and two in Eastern India, including Ceylon, evidently pre-Buddhistic, like the numerous Bod charms or \"little teeth\" which Lingaites have worn upon their persons from prehistoric times.\n\nThe Fo-OM. mountain-temples have not yet lost the characteristics of their Nature-worship, though most have been rebuilt under the Ming dynasty\u2014probably at heart more Shint\u014d-ists than Buddhists. Of course the numerous monks call themselves Buddhists, or rather F\u014d-ists, which, if we go back to the radical ancient meaning of F\u014d, would signify a Bod-ist; for a Bod or F\u014d was \"a tree, stick, rod, sprout, long or growing thing,\" and a Ruler, as the bearer of the Rod.\n\nThus the D\u014dr-ji or Sacred Sceptre of Tibet, the analogue of the Dandpan (Siva's Danda), is there termed Fo, Bo, Po, L\u0101, or Lh\u0101, at once a spirit, god, stick, or mace, from which the Dalai Lama claims direct descent, as others\ndo from \u0100dam\u2014a term the Indian Muslam applies to the temple Buds as symbols of Mah\u0101deva. The Indian colonists of Java and Tchampa or Co-Toheng also called their gods or Buds, P\u014d. \"My Lady\" of their capital was always addressed as P\u014d-Nagara, and this many centuries before they knew of Buddhism.\n\nIn the Tibetan Him\u0101laya Bo-t, Po-t, Bhot or Bud, is radically a Lh\u0101 or L\u0101; hence the country of Bhut-ia or Bhut-an means, says Dr. Waddell in his \"Tibetan Names,\" \"the end of Bud or Pot,\" that is Tu-bet or Tu-pot, or \"land\" par excellence of Buds, Bhuts or spirits; see Beng. As. Jour. 1891. But enough, though much more could be said, of Bud, Bud-\u0101-r, or M\u0101dra.\n\nI would not have said so much, but that the old deity seems to confuse Arch\u00e6ologists from Scandinavia to India and China, and to vitiate many valuable papers and researches. The old god is not seen by those who only visit the town and city temples of great gods like Vishnu, Siva, Indra, and other Bhagavatas, nor indeed, if we search only in the chief shrines of villages; for he is not now favoured, at least outwardly, by Pandites, Brahmans, or even local Purohits or Puj\u0101ris; but will usually be found by those who know him, lurking in some quiet nook close by. His holy place is the family niche or Deva takht in hut or humble cottage; and there old and young cleanse, decorate and worship him morn and eve. In native states he is more prominent, and may be seen in corn-fields, a cool corner of the cottage garden, or bye-path, to house, door, or well, where the pious, and especially women and children, may be seen sweeping and beflowering his modest hyp\u00e6thral shrines. He may be only \"the smooth stone of the stream\" to which Isaiah says (lvii. 6) his people gave meat and drink offerings, or the Bast or Bashath \u05e0\u05b0\u05d1\u05b8\u05e9, the Phenician Set, or B\u0101l Barith, or Latin Jupiter F\u00e6deris, of Jeremiah xi. 13 and Judges viii.; but he is still the Bud or B\u014dd dearest of all gods to the hearts of the peasants of Southern and Central India.\n\nJ.

The Author of the Khal\u0101\u1e63at-at-Taw\u0101r\u012bkh.\n\nPitfold, Shottermill, Surrey.\n\n26th October, 1894.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014It occurred to me that some information about Suj\u00e1n Singh, the author of the Khal\u0101\u1e63at-at-Taw\u0101r\u012bkh, might be obtained at Bat\u00e1la, his native place, and so I wrote to the Deputy-Commissioner of Gurd\u0101spur on the subject. Through the courtesy of Mr. Renouf, the Officiating Deputy-Commissioner, I have received a communication from Q\u00e1\u1e93\u00ed Tasaddaq Hussain, a resident of Bat\u00e1la, of which the following is an extract:\n\n\"The compiler of the Khal\u0101\u1e63at-at-Taw\u0101r\u012bkh, Suj\u00e1n Singh, was by caste a dh\u012br khatri, and was a resident of Bat\u00e1la, in the Gurd\u0101spur district. He lived in the time of Alamg\u00edr Aurangzib, and was employed under various Am\u00edrs of the Chag\u00e9t\u00e1\u00ef family as their munshi or secretary. The Khal\u0101\u1e63at-at-Taw\u0101r\u012bkh was compiled by him in 1107 Hijra. Among his writings there is also a book called Khal\u0101\u1e63at-al-Insh\u00e1, in which he describes the art of polite writing. This was written in 1105 Hijra. Some people also call him Suj\u00e1n R\u00e1i, but in both books he signs himself Suj\u00e1n Singh Dh\u00edr. He was not a K\u00e1nungo. The above information is derived from his books, for the inhabitants of Bat\u00e1la of the dh\u012br caste know nothing about him.\"\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.

OBITUARY NOTICES.\n\nDr. Terrien de Lacouperie.\u2014We deeply regret to announce the death of Dr. Terrien de Lacouperie, which occurred at his residence, 136, Bishop's Road, Fulham, on October 11th, of typhoid fever. Dr. de Lacouperie was born in Normandy, and was educated with the view of his entering into commercial life. For some years he was associated with the house of business with which his father and brothers were connected, but his real interests were centred in linguistic studies. To these he devoted every moment of the spare time at his disposal, and in 1867 he published a work on the subject entitled \"Du Langage,\" which, at the time, attracted considerable attention. As he advanced in his studies his desire grew to get as far back as possible in the history of languages, and he began with an investigation into the most archaic forms of the Chinese characters. About this time George Smith, following in the footsteps of Sir Henry Rawlinson, and assisted by the discovery of the library at Nineveh, was throwing open wide the doors of Babylonian learning. It had already been conjectured by several writers that there might be some connection between the civilization of China and Babylonia, but no substantial evidence had been adduced in support of the theory. This conjecture may have suggested to Dr. de Lacouperie the advisability of making a scientific investi-\ngation into the subject. But however that may be, he took up the comparative study of the languages and civilization of China and Babylonia, with learned zeal. For years he pursued the subject, neglecting everything else, and at length was able to establish identities sufficiently numerous and striking to convince any but the most sceptical of the very close relationship, both as regards their civilization and written characters, which existed between the peoples of the two areas in ancient times. In 1879 he settled in London, and in the following year published a pamphlet entitled \"The Early History of the Chinese Civilization,\" in which he gathered up the proofs which he accumulated in support of his theory.\n\nWhile prosecuting these researches he was attracted to the oldest book of the Chinese, \"The Book of Changes.\" This work had been a hopeless puzzle to all those\u2014natives as well as foreigners\u2014who had attempted to explain it. Guided by a scholarly instinct Dr. de Lacouperie perceived that the basis of that work consisted of fragmentary notes of an early age, mostly of a lexical character; that the original meaning to be placed upon them had been lost; and that they bore a close resemblance to the so-called syllabaries of Chaldea. Following up these clues he gained so clear an insight into it that he might almost have said with Merlin:\n\n\"O ay! it is but twenty pages long,\nBut every page having an ample marge,\nAnd every square of text an awful charm,\nWrit in a language that has long gone by,\nSo long, that mountains have arisen since\nWith cities on their flanks;\nAnd every margin scribbled, crost, and cramm'd\nWith comment, densest condensation, hard\nTo mind and eye; but the long sleepless nights\nOf my long life have made it easy to me.\"\n\nOn this subject he contributed several papers to the pages\nof this Journal, in which he gave translations of some of the chapters of this difficult book; and if his life had been prolonged he would no doubt have completed the translation of the entire work. With the same erudition and literary insight he made a comparative study of the languages of earlier Asia generally, and twice was presented by the \"Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres\" with the Prix Julien for the best works of the year on China.\n\nIn 1884 Dr. de Lacouperie was appointed Professor of Comparative Philology applied to the languages of South-eastern Asia, at University College.\n\nAmong his best known works were the following:\n\n\"Catalogue of Chinese Coins in the British Museum.\" Vol. I. 1892.\n\n\"Les Langues de la Chine avant les Chinois.\" 1888.\n\n\"The Oldest Book of the Chinese, the Ykking, and its Authors.\" 1892.\n\n\"The Western Origin of the Early Chinese Civilization.\" 1894.\n\nHe was also Editor of the Babylonian and Oriental Record.\n\nR. K. D.\n\nJames Darmesteter.\u2014It is hardly six months since the Council\u2014one of the Honorary Members of the Society, Dr. A. Sprenger, of Heidelberg, being dead\u2014recommended \"that the vacancy thus occasioned should be filled up by the election of Mons. James Darmesteter, the distinguished Professor of Persian at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, and Secretary of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique. As the members of the Society will be aware, Mons. Darmesteter is the greatest living authority on Zoroastrian literature, and is distinguished not only for his wide philological knowledge in that and other fields, but also for his thorough grasp of historical criticism, and for his mastery of style and power of exposition. It will also be a peculiar pleasure to this Society to be able to confer an honour upon a scholar who adds to his other attainments a very deep and sympathetic acquaintance with English literature.\"\nDarmesteter is no more: a short illness at Maisons-Laffitte has broken, on the 29th of November, 1894, the thin thread which united this vast intellect to his weak frame.\n\nJames Darmesteter was the son of a bookbinder of Ch\u00e2teau-Salins, where he was born the 28th March, 1849. His elder brother was the well-known philologist, Ars\u00e8ne Darmesteter, who died on the 16th November, 1888. Who could then predict the brilliant scientific career of the poor Jewish artisan's sons? Though for both, life was cut short in the forties\u2014that is, at the height of mental activity\u2014their failing health could hardly have permitted us to hope that, brief though it was, their earthly career should have run so long. In fact, Darmesteter's life was a long struggle of mind against matter, of brain against body, of high intellectual attainment against physical deformity. He went through the regular course of studies in Paris; a student at the Lyc\u00e9e Condorcet, where he carried off, in 1866, the prix d'honneur de rh\u00e9torique at the Concours g\u00e9n\u00e9ral; he graduated in letters and in sciences as a bachelor, then as a licentiate in letters (1868) and at law (1870); he took the degree of Doctor in Letters in 1877, with a thesis on the Iranian dualism of Ormazd and Ahriaman.\\(^1\\) Michel Br\u00e9al and the much-regretted Abel Bergaigne were his first masters, and the former has paid a most graceful tribute to his memory in *Le Temps* of 2nd November, 1894. His first essays were devoted to the language and literature of ancient Persia.\\(^2\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) \"Ormazd et Ahriaman, leurs origines et leur histoire,\" par J. Darmesteter. 8vo.

A sudden death had carried away and cut off, in the prime of life, the young and already celebrated Arabic Professor, Stanislas Guyard; the Persian Professor Barbier de Meynard, Hon. Member R.A.S., being transferred to the vacant chair, Darmesteter took his place. Darmesteter delivered his opening lecture on the 16th April, 1885: it is a general survey of the history of Persia, which embraces history, religion, literature.\u00b9 A few weeks before, on the 28th February, 1885, he gave at the Sorbonne, before the Scientific Association of France, a paper on the \"Mahdi, from the beginning of Islam to our day.\"\u00b2\n\nIn order to complete his researches he visited India, where he resided from February, 1886, to February, 1887\u2014about eleven months\u2014of which he spent three at Bombay, seven at Peshawar and Hazara, the few remaining weeks being spent travelling from Bombay to the Punjab, from the Punjab\n\nin 1881, the Volney Prize at the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres.

In the latter place he was warmly received by the Parsi community, which, indeed, is never backward in welcoming distinguished foreigners. At a meeting in the Bai Bhikaiji Shapurji Bengali Parsi Girls' School, Fort, presided over by Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy, Bart., C.S.I., Darmesteter delivered a lecture on the place of Parsi-ism in History.\u00b9 His experiences of India have been embodied in a volume,\u00b2 dedicated to Lord Reay, Governor of Bombay, and to Lady Reay.

As such he had to write the yearly reports of the progress of Oriental studies, which had done so much for the fame of Jules Mohl and Ernest Renan. It is not saying a little that he showed himself worthy of his predecessors, and that the notice he read on the life and labours of Ernest Renan at the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique, on the 22nd of June, 1893, is second to none of the best pages of the great philosopher.\u2075\n\n\u00b9 \"Parsi-ism: its Place in History.\" A lecture delivered at Bombay by Professor James Darmesteter. 8vo. pp. 32.

Paris, Imprimerie nationale, 1893.\nThe field of Oriental studies was hardly large enough for Darmesteter's activity. If nature did not make an orator of him, certainly with his pen Darmesteter had much of the temper of a debater and of a polemist, and periodical literature could not fail to fascinate him somewhat. For several years he was one of the Editors of the Revue Critique, to which he gave a great many critical notices on works like Spiegel's \"Iranian Antiquity,\" Delattre's \"Peuple et empire des M\u00e8des jusqu'\u00e0 le fin du r\u00e8gne de Cyaxare,\" Oppert's \"Peuple et langue des M\u00e8des,\" Evers' \"Av\u00e9nements de la puissance perse sous Cyrus,\" Justi's \"Histoire de la Perse ancienne,\" N\u00f6ldeke's \"Histoire d'Ardeshir,\" Keiper's \"Les Perses d'Eschyle,\" Gibb's \"Gudrun, Beowulf, and Roland,\" Shairp's \"Essays on Poetry,\" Elze's \"Lord Byron,\" G. Herbert's \"The Temple,\" etc. He made his d\u00e9but on the 16th August, 1882, in the Journal des D\u00e9bats, to which he contributed, besides his Oriental essays, a number of articles on various subjects\u2014\"Criticism,\" \"Ireland,\" \"Formosa,\" \"India,\" etc. His \"Coup d'\u0153il sur l'histoire du peuple juif,\" published in the Nouvelle Revue, created a stir by its warmth and its eloquence. When last year Calmann L\u00e9vy offered him and Louis Ganderax the editorship of the Revue de Paris, I feel pretty sure that the great publisher's proposal gave satisfaction to a secret craving of my late friend. Nor did he fail to take to heart his new task, and to contribute himself to the new Review some of the best papers which have appeared in its pages.\n\nBut the great work of his life was the translation of the Avesta.

Urged in 1884 by Max M\u00fcller to complete his translation, Darmesteter, thinking himself unprepared for the task, declined the offer; but after his journey to India, urged by his wife, he resumed the work in 1888, and brought it last year to a successful end. This translation of the Zend-Avesta comprises three huge quarto volumes of the \"Annales du Mus\u00e9e Guimet\";\u00b2 it is Darmesteter's magnum opus, and this very year the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres awarded it the prize of twenty thousand francs.\n\nI suppose that the biographer was thinking of this work when, writing about Darmesteter in the Athen\u00e6um (No. 3496, Oct. 27th, 1894), he said: \"In him was realized the perfect ideal of scholarship, that happy blending of profound learning, daring originality, and transparent clearness of expression which, save for rare exceptions, France alone seems able to produce; and by his premature death science has suffered a loss which may well be called irreparable.\" This, his last great labour, seems to have exhausted his feeble constitution.\n\nDarmesteter had married a graceful English lady, Miss Mary Robinson, well known for her poetical talent, and so far versed in French literature as to be able to give us a new book on the famous chronicler Froissart.\u00b3 The last years of the life of Darmesteter passed away in the happiness\n\n\u00b9 \"The Sacred Books of the East,\" edited by F.

London: Luzac & Co., 1894.\n\nThis book is as scholarly as it is useful. Al-Baid\u0101wi's work, although not one of the easiest, is one of the most popular commentaries of the Qor\u0101n, and should be read by every student of Arabic. Of particular importance are the numerous grammatical annotations which give the beginner an insight into the method of the Arabic national grammarians, and which form an excellent preparatory study for the perusal of these works in the original. The rather concise scholia also form a good introduction, not only into the criticism of the Qor\u0101n, but in particular into the early history of Moslim dogmas and the development of the sects.\n\nProf. Margoliouth chose S\u016bra iii., which, although one of the longest, is not so tedious as S\u016bra ii., and is of great interest from theological, polemical, and historical points of view. A selection of smaller S\u016bras, representing the chief phases of the Qor\u0101n, would perhaps have been more commendable, but this unimportant circumstance in no way diminishes the value of the book. The translation also of the text of the Qor\u0101n is thoroughly original and clear. The introduction and the remarks in particular, which form one-third of the book, show how well Mr. Margoliouth has mastered the immense literatures of Moslim Tradition, Grammar, and Kal\u0101m.\nThe Ash'arite views of Al-Baid\u0101w\u012b are continually perceptible in opposition to those of the Mu'tazilites, especially Zamakhshari, although he largely depends on the latter's Kashsh\u0101f. Prof. Margoliouth has not failed to call attention to this in the preface as well as in his notes. Al-Baid\u0101w\u012b's criticism of the Mu'tazilite doctrines is not very sharp, but it is hardly probable that he \"by oversight\" or \"unthinkingly\" should have allowed these to appear in his commentary (see remm. 41, 130, 236, 418, 619, 634), as he visibly inclines towards allegorical interpretation. Instances of this are his explanations of v. 5 (see Shahrastani, ed. Cureton, p. 76), and the tradition connected with v. 6, that Muhammad said: The heart of man is between the two fingers of the Merciful. Al-Baid\u0101w\u012b gives an allegorical explanation which Al-Ash'ar\u012b (Shahrastani, p. 72) unmistakably rejects.\n\nWith respect to the meaning of Hanif, Mr. Margoliouth seems to favour Sprenger's explanation, but the latter's theory of the Hanyferei is entirely unfounded. The simple negative meaning of the word is not only given at the verse in which it occurs (60), but also by Al-Baid\u0101w\u012b. There is nothing to support the view of the existence of a sect of Hanifs.\n\nIt was a happy thought of the author to append the collation of the Constantinople edition of 1303 H. with that by Fleischer, whereby the purchase of copies of the book for students is greatly facilitated. The perusal of Professor Margoliouth's latest book thus affords pleasure from beginning to end.\n\nH. HIRSCHFELD.\n\nUntersuchungen ueber die 'Add\u0101d auf Grund von Stellen in Altarabischen Dichtern von Friedrich Giese, Dr.phil. Pp. 59. Berlin: S. Calvary & Co., 1894.\n\nThe importance of this little book lies in the author's endeavour to restrict the number of recognized add\u0101d, i.e.\nArabic words which embrace two opposite meanings. Words of the same kind can be traced in other languages, particularly in the different dialects. The circumstance that the Arabs alone have produced a literature on the subject is due to scholastic mannerism rather than to a true comprehension of the structure of their language, although the lexicographical value of the works in question is considerable. Dr. Giese has founded his researches on the only book existing in print on the subject, viz Al-Anb\u0101r\u012b's Kit\u0101b-ul-add\u0101d (ed. Houtsma), and also on the dissertation of Redslob based upon it. He examines only those add\u0101d agreed upon by both authors and which he has found in old Arabic poems. He displays great discrimination with excellent results, and if of the long list given by Redslob he can only establish twenty-two, this is a gain rather than otherwise. Even those might be further restricted if we knew more of the original meanings of Arabic roots. Certainly the enormous difficulties encountered in the endeavour to master the old Arabic poets render them a somewhat precarious means of elucidating words of doubtful sense, especially as poetic licence with regard to synonymy is unlimited. The method employed by Dr. Giese in the classification of those add\u0101d which he admits, is no doubt very appropriate, but in some instance they can hardly be regarded as convincing. This e.g. is the case with \u0645\u062b\u0644 (p. 20 sq.), the original meaning of which, to stand upright, is applicable in most of the verses quoted. In Tar. 13, 1, the Bemaler is, to say the least, doubtful. The verse Zuh. 17, 3 should be translated: \"Asm\u0101 has a mansion in Alghamrain standing upright like the (letters of) writing,\" etc. Finally the translation of Hud. 273, 53 is unsatisfactory. I think it should be: \"The she-camel stretched out her forelegs trying to escape, whilst heavily laden with (skins of) water, behind pathless hilly tracts (which she has in front of her).\"\n\nIn the quotations where \u0635\u0631\u062e is said to occur in contrasting significations the word shouting answers the purpose, as the reader is guided by the context; this, however, cannot\nbe reckoned as a \u1e0didd. The same also holds good for other examples, which I therefore pass over, and will only notice a few more details. The translation of the verse, \u1e24am. 504, 1 (p. 10) . . . . etwas verloren, das absehbar vor mir liegt, is not intelligible. The right translation is given by Rueckert, ii. p. 8. As to \u0623\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0644\u064f \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631ifle, see the Div\u0101n of Hass\u0101n b. Th\u0101bit, ed. Tunis, p. 92, l. 9. Dr. Giese's remarks on \u0641\u0631\u0642 are of course just; in Qor\u0101n ii. 24 it certainly means above, although not, as he thinks, signifying a greater degree of diminutiveness. For the subjects of many of the parables dispersed over a large part of the Qor\u0101n, Mohammed chose animals and even those of the lower orders, e.g. spider (xxix. 40), camel (vii. 38), dog (ib. 175), and again, later on, the ass (lxii. 5). The verse in question is directed against possible criticism of All\u0101h's custom of attaching revelations to the habits of low animals. Mohammed, therefore, says: \"All\u0101h is not ashamed of employing as the subject of a parable a gnat, and what is above it (larger animals),\" etc.\n\nWe must also not omit to note that the philosophical side of the question of a\u1e0d\u1e0d\u0101d is very adroitly treated, and particularly pleasing is the rectification of the erroneous theories of Abel, whose uncritical list is misleading. Dr. Giese's style is rather involved, but otherwise we are indebted to him for his clever researches.\n\nH. HIRSCHFELD.\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0628\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0644\u0642\u0627\u062a. THE SEVEN POEMS SUSPENDED IN THE TEMPLES AT MECCA. Translated from the Arabic by Captain F. E. Johnson, R.A., with an Introduction by Shaikh Faizullabh\u0101i, B.A., Fellow of the University of Bombay, Head-Master Anjuman-i-Isl\u0101m Schools, Author of \"The Moslem Present.\" Pp. xxiii. and 238. London: Luzac & Co., 1894.\n\nThe scientific spirit in which this edition was undertaken can be judged from the title, and still better from the\nintroduction, in which (p. xi.), with much complacency, the fable of these poems having been woven in gold and suspended in the Ka'ba, is revived\u2014a fable, the absurdity of which was finally demonstrated as much as thirty years ago by Noeldeke (Beitraege zur Kenntniss der Poesie der alten Araber, p. xvii. sqq.). The introduction gives further \"an outline of the characteristic features of the poems with an exposition of the points of similarity and difference\" but the attempt at a critical treatment is limited to the remark in the preface\u2014written by Captain Johnson\u2014that \"lines which have been found in some copies and not in others are marked with asterisks.\" This is rather inadequate; also the sources drawn upon are not mentioned. References to the works of European scholars on the subject are likewise sought for in vain. Each poem is preceded by a very short biographical account of the poet, as well as by an exposition of its metre and the respective modification with an explanation of the technical terms. To mark the rhythm all the first verses are divided by perpendicular lines, but soon the first shows inaccuracies. The text of the verses is almost completely vocalized. In the annotations, to which Shaikh Faizullabhai also contributed, a limited number of different readings is given, but without reference to their authorities. In the translation appended to each verse additional words are printed in italics. In the text of Imru\u2019ulqais, of which I examined a part, in v. 2 is to be read \u0646\u0633\u062c\u062a\u060c in v. 6 \u0645\u0631\u0627\u062a\u0647\u060c on account of the metre. The translation is, on the whole, reliable if we overlook occasional inaccuracies. The print is small and not very distinct. This rather primitive edition can scarcely be recommended to European students, unless in conjunction with a more critical work or under the guidance of an experienced teacher.\n\nH. HIRSCHFELD.\nDr. H. Stumme. Tripolitanisch-Tunisische Beduinenlieder. Pp. xii.+153. Leipzig, 1894.\n\nThe author, who has made his mark by the publication of North African Arabic tales, gives a further instalment of the rich materials collected in the same province. He publishes here for the first time a number of popular songs gathered from the Bedouins of Tunis, with a phonetic transcription and German translation. In an interesting introduction, Dr. Stumme discusses these poems from various points of view\u2014the philological, psychological, and metrical. It is a valuable contribution towards the knowledge of those dialects, and throws light upon modern vulgar Arabic poetry. We obtain a clear insight into the life of the Bedouins of North Africa as depicted in their poetical productions. In order to enhance the philological value of his publications, Dr. Stumme has added (pp. 135-153) a glossary of the words contained in the \"tales\" and now in the \"songs.\"\n\nM. Gaster.\n\nElf St\u00fccke im \u0160ilha-Dialect von T\u00e1z\u00ebrwalt, von Dr. Hans Stumme (Extract from the Journal of the German Oriental Society). 8vo. pp. 28. Leipzig, 1894.\n\nThese Eleven Pieces in the Shilha-Dialect\\(^1\\) of T\u00e1z\u00ebrwalt will be welcome to all students of the Berber language, and also to folklorists. Besides some vocabularies, we have had in this peculiar dialect some texts with translations published by the late Prof. F. W. Newman and Prof. Ren\u00e9 Basset, of Algiers. The original texts now published appear in Roman characters, are as the author heard them from the manager of a Moorish troupe of acrobats at Dresden, and are followed by an accurate translation in German. The author's system of transliteration differs widely from the system adopted by the French school; it is undoubtedly\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf. R. N. Cust, A Sketch of the Modern Languages of Africa, i. pp. 113, 114.\nmore scientific. As far as the consonants are concerned, this system is nearly satisfactory: the judicious use of diacritical signs avoids such objectionable double consonants as sh, kh, th; the author distinguishes carefully the vowels i and u from the consonants j (English y) and v, and he rightly writes T\u00e1s\u00e9rwalt where French scholars write Tasroualt. Perhaps I should object to the system of amalgamating words without any regard to etymology, and, above all, to the somewhat exaggerated number of vocalic sounds: this is rather calculated to puzzle many readers, as it must be feared that too much accuracy in that respect may cause confusion. Nevertheless, we must thank Dr. Stumme for his careful exertions in this field: it is a beginning full of promise, and I hope the series will be continued.\n\nTH. G.

JULES PERRUCHON (Extract from the Asiatic Journal of Paris). 8vo. pp. 52. Paris, 1894.\n\nThe publication of such interesting texts, with commentaries and translations, is calculated to give us more and more insight into the ancient and once so mysterious history of Ethiopia, as well as to further promote the knowledge of the Ethiopian language. I have had already the opportunity of pointing out the author's exertions in this field, and he must be warmly congratulated upon this new production, the value of which is much enhanced by the foot-notes he has contributed to it: besides the texts and translations previously mentioned by me, I must notice here the Vie de Lalibala, roi d'Ethiopie (one vol., Algiers), text and translation from a MS. in the British Museum.\n\nTH.

Paris, 1894.\n\nThis new series consists, perhaps, of the most interesting texts yet published: the learned author's introduction forms by itself a complete paper of high value, and, as usual, the whole is illustrated by numerous bibliographical and other notes.\n\nI may mention here that Prof. Ren\u00e9 Basset has been promoted lately to the Directorship of the \u00c9cole sup\u00e9rieure des lettres of Algiers, the well-deserved reward of a comparatively short but very efficient literary career: his numerous friends have warmly applauded the action thus taken by the French Minister of Public Instruction.\n\nTh.

Leroux, 1894.\n\nThis well-known work, in its new shape, assumes a higher value than ever, from the introduction and commentaries added to the translation by Prof. Ren\u00e9 Basset. What was merely a poem, relating the main facts of Mohammed's life and giving a summary of the Mussulman creed, becomes thus a highly interesting contribution to the historical growth of religions. The following quotation from the introduction will explain the learned author's point of view: \"\u00c0 l'origine, Mohammed n'avait gu\u00e8re connu le Christianisme que par les sectes h\u00e9r\u00e9tiques et les \u00e9vangiles apocryphes; le Juda\u00efsme par l'aggada plut\u00f4t que par la Bible: en se d\u00e9veloppant, la th\u00e9ologie Musulmane, plus au courant du Christianisme, tendit \u00e0 en rapprocher de plus en plus le fondateur de l'Islam et \u00e0 attribuer \u00e0 celui-ci les miracles qui devaient le rendre au moins l'\u00e9gal de J\u00e9sus.

Hartleben, 1894.\n\nThis new Handbook is based on the best French works published in France and Cochin China during the last thirty years: it is invaluable for those who, not being well acquainted with French, are acquainted with German, as no such treatise exists in English. The book consists of a theoretical part, an extensive and clear practical part, a chrestomathy, an Annamese-German Vocabulary, a note on the Sinico-Annamese writing, a collection of proverbs and idiomatic expressions, and some tables of characters: from this it will be seen that the compiler has done his best to give a complete handbook, and, indeed, he has marvellously succeeded in his endeavour.\n\nTh.

Hirzel, 1894.\n\nThe Houw\u0101ra (\u062d\u0648\u0627\u0631) are a tribe scattered through many places in North Africa: whether they are genuine Arabs, as they claim to be, or Arabic-speaking Berbers, is still an unascertained fact. Physically, they rather appear to be of Berber descent; but the fact that, although they live in the middle of Berber populations, they speak Arabic, is very perplexing, and I will not attempt to settle this question. The Houw\u0101ra, whose peculiar dialect is here illustrated, inhabit the tract of land known as W\u0101d S\u016bs, in South Morocco: they form a linguistic island surrounded by Shilha populations, thus preserving their Arabic in the middle of Berber-speaking people; they enjoy a very bad reputation, so bad that a poet has said: \"With all Moslims there is something good, only with the Houw\u0101ra there is nothing.\" The learned compilers of the texts now published intend to give a complete grammatical account of the dialect spoken by these Houw\u0101ra: their vocabulary is very interesting, as it contains many words little known or even quite unknown; as a phonetical peculiarity, I may note here the very frequent vanishing of the short vowels. The texts, which consist chiefly of popular tales, have been obtained from a young Houw\u0101ra, who had just come from his native country to perform in a Moorish troupe of acrobats at Dresden. It appears that it was not an easy task to extract any linguistic information from this young rascal: when asked to translate into his vernacular the sentence \"Mustapha has done this and that,\" he invariably answered: \"I do not know any Mustapha\"; when asked to translate \"I am dead,\" he answered: \"No, I am not dead.\" But the more difficult the task, the more we must commend the skill and sagacity of the compilers, who have succeeded in giving to linguists and folklorists a most interesting collection of tales with an accurate translation.\n\nTH. G. DE G.\nA Kannada-English Dictionary. By Rev. F. Kittel.\nBasel Mission Press, Mangalore, 1894.\n\nStudents of the South Indian languages will welcome the completion of this work, which has been in hand for upwards of fifteen years. During that time inquiry has not been at a standstill. On the contrary, the period has been one of unusual activity in researches into the literature of Karn\u0101\u1e6daka, the antiquity and extent of which have been hitherto but imperfectly known or recognized. Much new and valuable information has thus come to light, even while this work was in progress, and indications may be discerned of something like a revival of Kannada learning. These circumstances, while they made the want of a good dictionary more generally felt, also perhaps placed the undertaking at some disadvantage in having to keep in sight an extending horizon.\n\nThe first dictionary of the language was the work of the Rev. W. Reeve, begun at Bellary in 1817 and published in Madras in 1832. This was superseded by the more portable edition published by the Rev. D. Sanderson at Bangalore in 1858, now long out of print. The present work therefore fills up a void. It is a bulky volume of 1752 pages. But the increase in size is greatly due to an admirable feature by which it is distinguished from its predecessors, and which at once places it above them. This is the introduction of numerous examples as to the uses and meanings of the words, with references to the authorities from which the quotations are taken. Had this system been carried out with the same completeness in regard to all the works made use of in compilation, the dictionary would have gone far towards attaining the goal of perfection which nothing human seems destined actually to reach. But in the case of a considerable number of the books consulted by him, the author states that the words they contain have been only partially indexed, time not allowing of his doing more. This, however, though simply noticed here as a ground of deficiency,\nis not such as to impair the utility of the work for general use. We may therefore pass on to express approval of another important feature, namely, the reference to cognate words existing in the other South Indian languages, a mode of illustration which often casts a valuable light in bringing out the meanings they have in common. The printing of leading words in prominent type is also to be commended.\n\nThe works consulted in preparing the verbal lists no doubt include most of those that are indispensable for the undertaking, but the utility seems questionable of a reliance on certain of those enumerated written in the modern dialect. The author was naturally desirous of adapting his work for use in all the countries in which the language is current, and to make it not only of classical and literary value, but practically useful in the ordinary transactions of life. And we are, indeed, led to suppose that in early times the purest form of the language was spoken and written in parts of the so-called South Mahratta country, or districts contiguous to it, more properly constituting and officially recognized as the Karn\u0101\u1e6daka Pr\u0101nt, but the vicissitudes of the recent past have, it is to be feared, led to such a predominance of Mahratti that the Kannada element in use is now far from what is reckoned as pure by the best authorities. Hence it is a doubtful proceeding, in the interests of the language, to give prominence and status to a so-called South Mahratta Kannada as distinguished from the general body of the language. In typography the necessity has been recognized of restoring characteristic obsolete letters, which have gone out of use partly, perhaps, through the fashion of printing-presses, but which are essential for the correct rendering of the language. A similar endeavour should be made to recall the verbal forms to the standard of the purity and elegance of the best age. Had less value been attached to certain of these modern works, more room would have been found for examples of the true classical period.\n\nNor must we be misled by the term Ancient Kannada,\nor Hala Kannada, as if it denoted what is out of date; for, as Bishop Caldwell says, \"classical Canarese is usually called 'Old Canarese,' but it may more properly be regarded neither as new nor as old, but simply as the language of Canarese literature, seeing that it is the language in which literary compositions seem always to have been written.\" Thus the importance of the grammatical work of Uripatunga cannot in future be ignored. And though the earliest authors are known to us only by name at present, the writings of Gunavarmma, Ponna, Ranna, and others are available and should undoubtedly find a place in the list of authorities consulted, together with all ancient nighantus or vocabularies devoted to the Kannada language itself. This course would be found to supply certain omissions that have been noted, principally of words occurring in poetry.\n\nTo make room for additional genuine terms of the language it would be no disadvantage to cut down the number of Sanskrit words introduced. The proportion of Sanskrit to be admitted to a work of this kind must always be a matter of doubt and discretion. But pure ordinary Sanskrit expressions, such as dirghak\u0101la and others that might be quoted, used in no special or different sense from the direct and plain meaning of the words in their own language, seem out of place in a dictionary of Kannada.\u00b9\n\nThe matters pointed out, however, are such as can easily be remedied in another edition. On the whole nothing but praise is due for the laborious and conscientious manner in which the work has been compiled. The printing and get-up well sustain the reputation of the Basel Mission Press at Mangalore.\n\nA few words may perhaps be permitted in conclusion on the name of the language. Mr. Kittel's return to\n\n\u00b9 The extent to which Dravidian words have been adopted into Sanskrit is a subject on which Mr. Kittel has laid some stress, and a list of 420 such words is given, but our limits do not allow of more than a mere mention of the matter here in passing.\nKannada, the genuine and actual form, is to be applauded, and is worthy of support by the learned world. The time seems now to have come when the use of the hybrid term \"Canarese,\" derived, it is believed, from the Portuguese Canarijs, and which the authorities attempt to make more correct by spelling it \"Kanarese,\" should be given up, certainly by scholars and learned institutions. The other South Indian languages\u2014Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Tulu\u2014are called by their right names, recognizable as such by the natives who speak them; whereas Kannada, a word which presents no difficulty in pronunciation, is not used to designate the speech of which it is the name, and this is called Canarese, a word significant of nothing at all to the natives of the country.\n\nThe language is of much interest, being spoken by ten millions or more of the inhabitants of India. The rising importance of the State of Mysore, of which it is the mother tongue, may lead to its wider spread. Its extensive literature, but recently brought to light, will probably occupy the attention of scholars more than in the past, as being a depository of the doctrines of the Digambara Jains and the Lingayts. The present seems, therefore, a suitable opportunity in which a special effort may be made to introduce the use of the right name\u2014Kannada.\n\nL. R.\n\nA Grammar of the Persian Language, by John T. Platts, Teacher of Persian in the University of Oxford: Part I.\u2014Accidence (London: Williams and Norgate, 1894; pp. xii. and 344).\n\nMr. Platts has long been known, by his excellent edition and translation of the Gulistan of Sa'di, as well as by his Urdu Grammar, as a careful and accurate scholar in the Persian and Hindustani languages; and to his recently published Persian Grammar (a book which deserves a cordial welcome from all students of that tongue) no higher praise\ncan be accorded than to say that it is in every way worth of his high reputation. Forbes' Grammar, and even Mirz\u0101 Ibr\u0101h\u012bm's, have long been quite inadequate to the needs of English students, for great advances have been made in Persian philology since they were written, and on the history of the language in particular a flood of light has been thrown by the labours of those who have devoted themselves to the elucidation of the Old Persian inscriptions, the Avesta, and the Pehlevi books, coins, and other monuments. Amongst these, few deserve a more honourable mention than the late Professor James Darmesteter, whose premature death last autumn caused so deep a sorrow, not only amongst his numerous friends and admirers, but amongst all those who had at heart the cause of Oriental scholarship. Him most wisely, has Mr. Platts taken as his model and guide in the compilation of his grammar: \"the book which has been my chief help and guide,\" says he (p. vii.), \"is the admirable and highly suggestive \u00c9tudes Iraniennes of Darmesteter, but for which much of this grammar would have been very imperfect.\"\n\nAn excellent feature of Mr. Platts' Grammar, to which he calls attention in the Preface (p. vi.), is the copious illustration of the rules laid down by apt quotations from Persian authors, especially poets; and we thoroughly concur in his belief \"that the student will learn more from an intelligent and careful examination of the utterances of some of the best Persian writers than from any amount of mere formal grammar.\" Mr. Platts' examples are, as a rule, not only felicitously chosen, but also represent a wide field of literature, much of which is unknown to the ordinary student. A full and conscientious use has also been made not only of the works of European scholars who have written on Persian Grammar, but also of the native grammarians, especially of Mirz\u0101 \u1e24ab\u012bb's Dast\u016br-i-sukhan, and H\u0101j\u012b Mirz\u0101 \u1e24useyn Kh\u0101n's Tanbihu's-\u1e63iby\u0101n (Constantinople, A.H. 1298).\n\nThe serious study of Persian Grammar is, compared with that of Arabic or Sanskrit, of so modern a growth, and\nthe materials for it are so inadequate, that it is not surprising if even the most carefully compiled work on the subject should leave plenty of room for differences of opinion on minor points. The following remarks and queries on various passages in Mr. Platts' Grammar are advanced in no captious or dogmatic spirit, but rather in the belief that true appreciation is best shown by candid criticism.\n\n1. Pronunciation.\u2014On p. 3 Mr. Platts says, in speaking of the letter \u03c8, \"in other cases (and especially after the long vowels) it has the sound of the Arabic \u03c8, that is, of our th, as in with, or that (which seems to have been the pronunciation in early times), and may even be written \u03c8.\" We should like to see \"had\" substituted for \"has,\" and \"used to be written\" for \"may even be written.\" Forms like \u0628\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0633\u0652\u062a\u064f, \u0628\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0631\u064e, which are constant in MSS. written in or before the 13th century, were seldom or never written after the 14th century; while the fact that even in 13th century MSS. \u03c8 is occasionally confounded with j would seem to show that even at that time it had lost the primitive dh-sound, and was pronounced (as it still is in words like \u0628\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0631\u064e, \u0628\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0631\u064e) as a z.\n\nOn p. 11 Mr. Platts describes the fat\u1e25a as representing, \"at least in the living speech,\" \"a sound somewhat between our a in cap and u in bun.\" As a matter of fact it oftener has, in the mouths of Persians, the sound of a in man or bad, especially where it is followed by two consonants, e.g. in words like hast, dast. It is for this reason that M. de Biberstein Kazimirski, and others who have striven accurately to represent the modern Persian pronunciation, have adopted the Scandinavian or Anglo-Saxon \u00e6 in transliteration as the equivalent of fat\u1e25a.\n\nOn p. 13 Mr. Platt says: \"In the last generation, a was generally sounded like our a in ball; but though still so sounded in parts of Persia (and especially in the K\u0101sh\u0101n dialect), it is now becoming very common to give it the sound of our a in bar, as it had in Persia in olden times, and has, even now, in the Persian of India;\" and in a note he\nadds: \"From the introduction to the Vasir of Lankur\u00e1n we learn that in the district of F\u0101rs all d's become \u016b,\" etc. Now we cannot recognize any tendency amongst the Persians to revert to the less broad sound of the long alif: we should rather say that it always had the sound of the a in war or all (something like Scandinavian a'), except before n, and occasionally m, when it often has the sound of \u016b, or u. Thus \u0646\u0627\u0646, n\u0101n (bread) is, as Mr. Platts says, pronounced n\u016bn (exactly like the English word noon), and \u0643\u062f\u0627\u0645, kud\u0101m (which), kud\u016bm. But sometimes it has the sound of short u (as in pull, full), as in \u0622\u0646 (pronounced un, not \u016bn), \u0643\u0631\u0645\u0648\u0646 (kirm\u016bn, not kirm\u016bn). So far as we know, it never has any sound but that of the a in all except before n and m. In the dialects, whether Northern (e.g. M\u0101zandar\u0101n\u012b), Western (e.g. Luri), Central (e.g. Kohr\u016bd\u012b, Natanz\u012b, Yezd\u012b), or Southern (e.g. S\u012bvand\u012b), it tends to become u in all cases; so that, for example, a guebre of Yezd, speaking the so-called \"Dari,\" says k\u016b'ida for k\u0101'ida (\u0642\u0627\u0639\u062f\u06c1); and, in the quatrains of B\u0101b\u0101 T\u0101hvi, one of the best-known dialectical poets of Persia, we find not only mihrb\u0101n\u012b for mihrb\u0101n\u012b (\u0645\u0647\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0646\u064a for \u0645\u0647\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0646\u064a), but m\u016b (\u0645\u0648) for ma (\u0645\u0627), as, for instance, in the following verse:\n\n\u0645\u06af\u0631 \u0634\u06cc\u0631 \u0648 \u0628\u0644\u0646\u06af\u06cc \u0627\u06cc \u062f\u0644 \u0627\u06cc \u062f\u0644\u060c \u0628\u0645\u0648 \u062f\u0627\u06cc\u0645 \u0628\u062c\u0646\u06af\u06cc \u0627\u06cc \u062f\u0644 \u0627\u06cc \u062f\u0644\u060c \u0627\u06af\u0631 \u062f\u0633\u062a\u0645 \u0641\u062a\u06cc \u062e\u0648\u0646\u062a \u0648 \u0631\u06cc\u0632\u0648\u0645\u060c \u0628\u0648\u0628\u06cc\u0645 \u062a\u0627\u062c\u0647 \u0632\u0646\u06af\u06cc \u0627\u06cc \u062f\u0644 \u0627\u06cc \u062f\u0644.\n\n\"Mag\u0101r shir u palangi, ey dil, ey dil? .\nBi-m\u016b da'im bi-jangi, ey dil, ey dil:\nAgar dastam futi, kh\u016bnat vi-rizhum;\nBi-vinum t\u0101 ch\u0113 rangi, ey dil, ey dil.\"\n\n\"Art thou a lion or a leopard, O heart, O heart?\nThou art ever at war with us, O heart, O heart:\nIf thou should'st fall into my hand, I will shed thy blood;\nI will see what colour thou art, O heart, O heart.\"\n\nOn the same page Mr. Platts, speaking of the majh\u016bl sounds of \u064a and \u0648 (\u064a and \u0648), admits that they have \"long been abandoned in Persia,\" and adds that the distinction between the ma'r\u016bf and majh\u016bl sounds of these two letters\n\"is now only met with in the writings of the older poets, and is noticeable in that an \u0113 (as in \u0634\u06cc\u0631, sher, 'lion'...) cannot rhyme with i (as in \u0634\u06cc\u0631, shir, 'milk').\" This, no doubt, is generally true; yet even in the older poets, notably Jal\u0101lu'd-D\u012bn R\u016bm\u012b (A.D. 1207\u20131273), we find exceptions to the rule, as, for instance, in the following verse from the Masnavi:\n\n\u0622\u0646 \u06cc\u06a9\u06cc \u0634\u06cc\u0631\u06cc\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0627\u062f\u0645 \u0645\u06cc\u062e\u0648\u0631\u062f\u060c\n\u0648 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u06cc\u06a9\u06cc \u0634\u06cc\u0631\u06cc\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0627\u062f\u0645 \u0645\u06cc\u062e\u0648\u0631\u062f.\n\n\"That one is a shir (lion) which eats man, while this one is a shir (milk) which man eats.\" As regards modern Persian pronunciation, we can only recollect having heard the majh\u016bl sound of \u0649 in two words, both proper names, viz. \u0641\u0631\u06cc\u062f\u0648\u0646 (pronounced Fer\u00e9d\u016bn) and \u062a\u06cc\u0645\u0648\u0631 (pronounced T\u0113m\u016br).\n\n2. Plurals.\u2014P. 37. While admitting with Mr. Platts that it is perhaps more logical to write the plural of \u062c\u0627\u0645\u0647 as \u062c\u0627\u0645\u0647\u200c\u0647\u0627 rather than as \u062c\u0627\u0645\u0647\u200c\u0647\u0627, we do not admit that the former is sanctioned by common usage. The vowel-points are but seldom used in writing Persian, and as it is practically inconvenient that the plurals of \u062c\u0627\u0645 and \u0646\u0627\u0645 and \u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647, \u062c\u0634\u0645 and \u062c\u0634\u0645\u0647, etc., should not be distinguished from one another, there is much to be said in favour of the prevailing custom of retaining the h\u0101-i-mukht\u0101fi before the plural termination \u0647\u0627. This, at any rate, is the ordinary practice. Forms of double plurals like \u0627\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0646, \u0627\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0646, \u0627\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0646, etc., mentioned by Mr. Platts on p. 39, we cannot but regard as solecisms most strongly to be condemned.\n\n3. Declension.\u2014We find ourselves unable to agree with all that Mr. Platts says on pp. 40\u201343 about the expression of the iz\u0101fat after words ending in vowels. We have to consider four cases, viz. words ending in \u0627 (\u0627), \u0627 (\u0627), \u0627 (\u0627), and \u0627 or \u0627 (\u0627, \u0627), and the rules which we should give are as follows:\n\nAfter words ending in \u0627 or \u0627 the iz\u0101fat is generally, and may always be, expressed by \u0649; but in the case of Arabic\nwords ending in \\(d\\) it may, at the option of the writer, be expressed by \\(i\\). If, however, \\(i\\) is used, *hamza* must not be superadded. To write \\(i\\) is a pure archaism, never, so far as we know, found in MSS. written in Persia during the last four centuries, though maintained by Indian writers. Hence we cannot approve such spellings as those adopted by Mr. Platts, \\(\\text{\u0627\u0641\u0631\u06cc \u062f\u0634\u062a \u0627\u0639\u0636\u0627\u06cc \u06cc\u06a9\u062f\u06cc\u06af\u0631}\\). We consider that the first should be either \\(\\text{\u0627\u0641\u0631\u06cc \u062f\u0634\u062a \u0627\u0639\u0636\u0627\u06cc \u06cc\u06a9\u062f\u06cc\u06af\u0631 (\u0627\u0698\u0627\u062f\u06cc \u06cc\u0627\u06a9\u062f\u06cc\u06af\u0631)}\\), or \\(\\text{\u0627\u0641\u0631\u06cc \u062f\u0634\u062a \u0627\u0639\u0636\u0627\u06cc \u06cc\u06a9\u062f\u06cc\u06af\u0631 (\u0627\u0698\u0627\u062f\u06cc \u06cc\u0627\u06a9\u062f\u06cc\u06af\u0631)}\\), and the second \\(\\text{\u0627\u0641\u0631\u06cc \u062f\u0634\u062a \u0627\u0639\u0636\u0627\u06cc \u06cc\u06a9\u062f\u06cc\u06af\u0631 (\u0627\u062d\u06cc\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u062f\u0634\u062a)}\\), or possibly in poetry \\(\\text{\u0627\u0641\u0631\u06cc \u062f\u0634\u062a \u0627\u0639\u0636\u0627\u06cc \u06cc\u06a9\u062f\u06cc\u06af\u0631 (\u0627\u062d\u06cc\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u062f\u0634\u062a)}\\). In printing old texts, by all means let us preserve the archaisms which they present; but let us do so consistently, and not perpetuate one while we consign others, just as prevalent in their own day, to oblivion.\n\nAfter words ending in \\(i\\) or \\(a\\) (\\(e\\)) the *iz\u0101fat* is generally, and may always be, expressed by \\(i\\). In the case of words ending in \\(i\\), however, we may optionally resolve \\(i\\) into \\(iy\\) or even \\(iyy\\), and indicate the *iz\u0101fat* merely by a *kesra*, as we should do after any other vowel. Thus, to take Mr. Platts' example, \\(\\text{\u0645\u0627\u0647\u06cc \u062f\u0631\u06cc\u0627}\\), we may either write\u2014\n\n1. \\(\\text{\u0645\u0627\u0647\u06cc \u062f\u0631\u06cc\u0627, m\u0101hi 'i-dary\u0101, or}\\)\n2. \\(\\text{\u0645\u0627\u0647\u06cc \u062f\u0631\u06cc\u0627, m\u0101hiy-i-dary\u0101, or (which is very common now-a-days in Persia)}\\)\n3. \\(\\text{\u0645\u0627\u0647\u06cc \u062f\u0631\u06cc\u0627, m\u0101hiyy-i-dary\u0101.}\\)\n\nThe second of these forms is chiefly used in poetry where the metre requires \\((\\ldots)\\) for \\((\\ldots)\\). The third is largely used in Persian editions of the poets; for the modern Persians seem to dislike the hiatus caused by a *hamza*, and only use it, as a rule, when it cannot be avoided, as, for instance, when the \\(y\u0101-i-wahdat\\), or \\(y\u0101-i-maqdar\\), or \\(y\u0101-i-nisbat\\) has to be added to a word ending with a vowel. We do not, however, agree with Mr. Platts that their dislike of the *hamza* carries them so far as to sound it as \\(y\\) in expressions like \\(\\text{\u0628\u0646\u062f\u06cc \u062e\u0648\u062f\u0627 (band\u00e9-i-khudd)}\\), which, according to Mr. Platts, should be pronounced \\(\\text{bandaye kh\u016bda}\\). Mr. Platts is\ncertainly (as he himself has privately pointed out to us) supported by several strong authorities in this statement, but nevertheless we feel ourselves unable to accept it, or to deviate from the view that *hamza* essentially signifies in Persian, as in Arabic (see p. 43, Rem. 6), the hiatus, or check in the breath-stream, which the pronunciation of one vowel immediately after another necessitates. Where *hamza* is written, *hamza* must be pronounced.\n\n4. Numerals.\u2014The forms *s\u0101w* (*dah*) for *s\u0101w* (*dah*), \"ten,\" and *y\u0101nsdah*, *duwansdah*, *sinsdah* (\"eleven,\" \"twelve,\" \"thirteen\"), mentioned on p. 69, must be extremely rare, and we have never met with them. We do not quite know why Mr. Platts describes the *tum\u0101n* as \"a gold piece reputed to have the value of 10,000 din\u0101rs;\" which is as though one should describe the English sovereign as \"a gold piece reputed to have the value of 960 farthings.\" In \u00a7 49 on p. 72 it might be added that in certain expressions (for the most part names of places or natural phenomena) the plural is used even after a numeral, as in the Persian name of the Great Bear, which they call *Haft B\u012br\u0101dar\u0101n*, \"the Seven Brothers.\"\n\n5. Pronouns.\u2014Although, as stated by Mr. Platts on p. 87, the use of the plural pronominal suffixes -*m\u0101n*, -*t\u0101n*, and -*sh\u0101n*, is, perhaps, less common in prose than in verse, in the Persian language of to-day, as written and spoken by Persians, they are very freely used. We think, for example, that the pronominal suffix of the first person plural is distinctly required after *khud* in the example given at the bottom of p. 91. Nor can we agree with the statement on p. 96 that \"in the spoken language of the present time the construction with *\u0101* or *\u0101z* is no longer used.\" The expression *\u0101n k\u0101s\u0101n\u012bk\u0113* \"with the double demonstrative,\" condemned on p. 101, seems to us to be thoroughly sanctioned by usage. We are also disposed to question the correctness of dropping the *tashdid* over the *l\u0101m* of *kull* (pp. 120\u2013121), and we think that the *iz\u0101fat* is required after it, as well as\n\nB.A.S.J. 1895.\nafter \u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645 and \u062c\u0645\u0644\u0647, at any rate in prose. Certainly for \"the whole world\" the Persians say tam\u0101m-i-duny\u0101, not, as Mr. Platts has it, tam\u0101m-duny\u0101.\n\n6. Verbs.\u2014The section dealing with the verbs is one of the most original and valuable portions of Mr. Platts' Grammar, and we would especially call attention to his remarks on the past tense on pp. 174\u20135. To the examples cited by him on p. 175 as illustrations of what he calls the \"passive construction\" of the pre-classical period, we may add two more (first noticed by R\u00fcckert, in the Z.D.M.G. for 1856, vol. x. p. 280) from the Sh\u0101hn\u0101ma:\n\n\u0646\u0633\u062a\u0646\u0634 \u0628\u06cc\u06a9 \u062c\u0627\u06cc \u0628\u0627 \u0634\u0647\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0631\u060c\n\u0628\u062f\u0627\u0646\u0634 \u0628\u062a\u0648\u0633 \u0622\u0646\u06af\u0647 \u0627\u0633\u0628\u0647\u0628\u062f\u06cc\n\nand H\u0101fiz supplies us with a few instances of an analogous peculiarity, tending, as we think, to weaken Mr. Platts' theory of a \"passive construction,\" of which we will here cite two examples. The first (ed. Rosenzweig-Schwannau, vol. ii. p. 93) runs as follows:\n\n\u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638 \u06a9\u0647 \u0647\u0648\u0633\u0645\u06cc\u06a9\u0646\u062f\u0634 \u062c\u0627\u0645 \u062c\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u06cc\u0646\u060c\n\u06af\u0648\u0631\u062f\u0646\u0638\u0631\u0622\u0635\u0641 \u062c\u0645\u0634\u06cc\u062f \u0645\u06a9\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0634\n\nOn mi-kunadash S\u016bd\u012b, the Turkish commentator, remarks:\u2014\n\"The pronominal -ash, is introduced to complete the metre, beautify the expression, and emphasize the meaning.\" The second instance occurs at p. 128 of the same volume, and runs:\n\n\u0639\u0631\u0636 \u0648\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0632\u062f\u0631 \u0645\u06cc\u062e\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0646\u0634\u0627\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0646\u062f\u0631\u062e\u062a\u060c\n\u0647\u0631\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0622\u0628 \u062e\u0648\u0631\u062f \u0631\u062e\u062a \u0628\u062f\u0631\u064a\u0627 \u0641\u06af\u0646\u0634\n\nHere also S\u016bd\u012b takes figan-ash as simply equivalent to figan; though perhaps we might rather consider \"rakht bi-dary\u0101 figan-ash\" as = \"rakht-ash bi-dary\u0101 figan.\"\n\nThe dialects, as Mr. Platts points out, afford much better instances of the continuation of the old Pahlav\u012b usage. Amongst the odes of H\u0101fiz in \u06cc is one written partly in\nArabic, partly in Persian, and partly in dialect, of which the following verse (emended by the help of several MSS. from S\u016bd\u012b's reading, followed, together with his erroneous explanation, by Rosenzweig) supplies us with a good instance of the construction:\n\n\u0628\u0650 \u067e\u06cc\u200c\u0645\u064e\u062c\u064e\u0627\u0646 \u063a\u0631\u0627\u0645\u062a \u0628\u0633\u067e\u0631\u06cc\u0645\u0627\u0646\u060c\n\u063a\u0631\u062a \u06cc\u06a9 \u0648 \u0631\u0648\u0634\u06cc\u0646\u06cc \u062a\u0631\u0627\u064b\u0645\u0627 \u062f\u06cc\n\n\"We will do penance at the threshold (pey-m\u0101ch\u0101n = p\u0101-m\u0101ch\u0101n, the lowest part of the room, by the door, where the shoes are removed and the \"feet kiss\" the ground) if thou hast seen any misconduct on our part.\" \"If thou hast seen,\" which in normal Persian = gar didi, is expressed in the dialect by the stem of the verb di + the pronominal suffix added to gar (ghar-at = gar-at).\n\nHere is another instance of the same thing from a dialectical poem by Sa'd\u012b (not included in the ordinary editions):\n\n\u06a9\u0647 \u062e\u06cc\u0631\u062a \u0628\u0648\u062a \u0627\u0632\u06cc \u0645\u0639\u0646\u06cc \u06a9\u062a \u0627\u0634\u062a\u0641\u062a\u060c\n\u0628\u06af\u06cc \u0631\u062d\u0645\u062a \u0648\u0633\u0639\u062f\u06cc \u0628\u0627 \u06a9\u0634 \u0627\u06cc \u06af\u0641\u062a\n\n\"May good accrue to thee from this moral which thou hast heard (kat i\u0161nuft = ki i\u0161nuft\u012b); say, 'May [God's] mercy rest on Sa'd\u012b, who hath uttered it (kash i' guft = ki in-r\u0101 guft). Another example of the same thing is supplied by another line from the same poem:\n\n\u0628\u0633\u0645 \u062f\u06cc \u06a9\u0633\u0648\u0631\u0647 \u0645\u0627\u0646\u062f \u0628\u06cc\u062f\u0647 \u0628\u06cc\u0632\u0634\u062a\uff0c\n\n\"Bas-um di (= bas d\u012bdam) ki'swar\u00e9 m\u0101nd, bida bizisht.\" (\"Often have I seen the horseman fail while the pedestrian passed on.\")\n\nOn p. 178 Mr. Platte mentions the rare and archaic conditional perfect. He might have added the equally rare and archaic conditional aorist and pluperfect, formed in the same way by adding \u06cc to the indicative. To these forms\nI especially called attention at pp. 435\u20137 of the J.R.A.S. for July, 1894.\n\nOn the same page Mr. Platts expresses an opinion that the \u0643\u0631\u062f in \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0647\u0645 \u06a9\u0631\u062f, aor., is not to be regarded, according to the usual view, as an \"apocopated infinitive,\" but as a verbal noun; and that khw\u0101ham kard, 'I shall, or will, do,' literally means, 'I desire the doing'; for, says he, \"an apocopated infinitive is contrary to all analogy in Persian.\" This view we find great difficulty in accepting, for firstly 'I desire the doing,' i.e. 'I wish to do,' is not expressed, as a rule, by the future, but by the appropriate tense of \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0646 followed by the aorist. Thus, in the modern language especially, there is a very clear distinction between 'khw\u0101ham raft,' 'I shall go' (the future), and 'mi-khw\u0101ham bi-ravam,' 'I wish to go' (the optative). Moreover it seems to us that the existence of an apocopated infinitive is supported by other evidence. Can bi-shikast, for instance, in the following well-known verse from Book i. of the Gulistan be explained otherwise than as an apocopated infinitive?\n\n\u0628\u0628\u0627\u0632\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0648 \u0642\u0631\u0626\u062a \u0633\u0631\u062f\u0633\u062a\u060c\n\u062e\u0637\u0627\u0633\u062a \u0628\u0627\u0686\u0647 \u0645\u0633\u06a9\u06cc\u0646 \u0646\u0627\u062a\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0634\u06a9\u0633\u062a\u060c\n\n7. Adverbs.\u2014We cannot agree with Mr. Platts that tanwin-fat\u1e25a \"is not usually pronounced except in India,\" for though hakka and hal\u0101 are much commoner than hakkan and halan as pronunciations of \u062d\u0644\u0627\u0644, on the other hand \u0627\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0642\u064b\u0627 \u0648 \u0627\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0642\u064b\u0627 are, so far as we know, almost always pronounced vaki'an and ittif\u0101kan.\n\nLastly, we altogether deny that the suffix \u0101 so commonly used in the current idiom of South Persia (Shir\u0101z, Kirm\u0101n, etc.) \"is not usually pronounced.\" That it is pronounced is an incontestable fact, in support of which (apart from the\nevidence of one's own ears) the following verse of K\u0101'\u0101ni's may be adduced:\n\n\u0686\u0648\u0646 \u0628\u0631\u062e \u0627\u0646\u06af\u06cc\u0632\u0647 \u06a9\u0647 \u06a9\u0627\u06cc \u067e\u0633\u0631 \u0648 \u0628\u06cc\u0627 \u0628\u062f\u0647\u060c\n\u0647\u06cc\u0686 \u0646\u0645\u06cc \u06af\u0631\u06cc\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \u0686\u0647 \u0647\u06cc\u0686 \u0646\u0645\u06cc \u067e\u0631\u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0647 \u0686\u0648\u0646\u060c\n\n(Metre:\u2014|\u2014\u2014|\u2014\u2014|\u2014\u2014|\u2014\u2014|\u2014\u2014)\n\nThese are almost the only points in the whole of Mr. Platts' excellent Grammar on which we feel compelled to dissent from his views, and we have discussed them at some length because we feel assured that, so far, at least, as England is concerned, his Grammar will henceforth be accepted as the best work on the subject hitherto produced, and will be used by English students almost universally. We therefore cordially hope that it may run through many editions, and that its sale may recompense Mr. Platts for the pecuniary risks which, apart from the labour involved in so arduous an undertaking, he has incurred in its publication. In the confident expectation that a new edition will be required in course of time, we append the following list of misprints, not included amongst the errata, which we have noticed during the perusal of the book.\n\nPage 14.

G. B.\nMr. Ojha, a pupil of the late Pandit Bhagv\u00e2n\u00e2l\u00e2 Indr\u00e2ji, and at present in the employ of the Udaypur Darb\u00e2r in Rajput\u00e2na, has compiled the present volume in order to provide his countrymen with a means for taking part more generally in the study of epigraphy, and in the elucidation of the history of India.\n\nOn thirty-nine lithographed plates he gives a variety of epigraphic alphabets together with specimens of texts. Next come four plates with numerals, and then seven plates of modern Indian characters. A plate showing the development of the Devan\u00e2gari letters and another with miscellaneous signs from various inscriptions make the conclusion. The letterpress, Hindi in Devan\u00e2gari, contains seven chapters: (1) The Antiquity of Writing in India; (2) The Indian Origin of the Pali Alphabet; (3) The Gandh\u00e2ra Alphabet; (4) An Account of Mr. Prinsep's Discoveries; (5) The Indian Eras; (6) The Ancient Numerals; (7) Explanatory Notes on the Plates. The text and the plates have been compiled, as Mr. Ojha carefully points out, from The Indian Antiquary, The Epigraphia Indica, The Arch. Survey Reports of West India, Dr. Burnell's South Indian Pal\u00e6ography, and The Journal of the Bengal Asiatic Society.\n\nMr. Ojha's aim is a most praiseworthy one, and it is to be hoped that his publication will spread a taste for epigraphic and historical research among the natives who are unable to read English. If their attention be drawn to the subject, we shall probably become acquainted with many inscriptions, lying about in inaccessible or little visited places.\n\nFrom a scientific point of view it is, however, impossible to commend Mr. Ojha's book. The letters of the plates, all drawn by hand, are frequently more or less inexact. Plates 29, 32, 33, 35, and 36 have been taken, as he himself states in the explanatory notes, from spurious\ninscriptions, and some others from suspicious or suspected grants. Such plates are useless and worse than useless, as they naturally bewilder or mislead the beginner. The arrangement of the alphabets is wanting in method, and a plate of Samkirtakas, 'miscellaneous signs, which would not go into their proper places,' ought not to occur. All these points and a good number of other small details will require correction in future. I think also that, if Mr. Ojha must talk about the origin of the alphabets and the possibility or impossibility of deriving the Pali characters from the Phoenician or Aramaic, it will be advisable for him to get and to study Professor Euting's Tables of the Aramaic Alphabets, which Pandit Igish\u1e6daram Mukundji can procure for him. His remarks at p. 8 f. show that he has not paid that attention to the subject which would entitle him to give an opinion.\n\nG.

It is, therefore, certain that Samvat means here \u00c7akasamvat, and that the MS. was not written in Rajputana, as has been conjectured, but in the Dekhan. The date corresponds to Wednesday.\n\nThe Five Zoroastrian G\u0101th\u0101s, with the Zend, Pahlavi, Sanskrit, and Persian Texts and Translations. By L. H. Mills, D.D. 8vo. Pp. xxx. and 622. (Leipsic: F. A. Brockhaus, 1892-94.)\n\nIn this work we have the result of some seventeen years of study and labour, undertaken with the view of enabling any person of liberal education to ascertain for himself the exact meaning of the Avesta G\u0101th\u0101s, the central documents of the Zoroastrian faith. For this purpose the Avesta text of each G\u0101thic stanza is separately furnished with a verbatim Latin and a free English rhythmical translation, together with transliterations and translations of its Pahlavi and Sanskrit versions, and a transliteration of a Parsi-Persian version of the Pahlavi. All the stanzas in the first G\u0101th\u0101, and nearly all of those in the last two, are likewise transliterated; and these materials are supplemented by 230 pages of commentary. The author also intends to publish a complete glossary and grammar of the Avesta G\u0101th\u0101s. With all this information before him, any Avesta student has ample opportunity to study the G\u0101th\u0101s for himself, merely observing that the various versions differ very much in value.\n\nThe original Avesta text is really of prehistoric authorship; composed in a language closely allied to the Vedic\nSanskrit, and applying the separate titles *Mazda* and *Ahura* to the Supreme Being, it thus affords us circumstantial evidence that it is older than the Behistun inscriptions of Darius I., which convert these two titles into the single name *Auramazda*. The oldest existing MSS. of the G\u0101th\u0101s were written 571 years ago, at Cambay, by a Parsi priest who had come from Persia; and there is documentary evidence of the descent of other similar MSS., extending as far back as A.D. 1020.\n\nThe Pahlavi version of the G\u0101th\u0101s is supposed to have been first prepared in the middle of the fourth century, when Shahpuhar II. was king; and to have been revised two centuries later, in the reign of King Khusr\u014d I. Quotations made from it, at the latter end of the ninth century, by the authors of the \"D\u0113nkard\" and \"Selections of Zad-sparam,\" show that its text was then practically the same as that still preserved in the G\u0101th\u0101 MSS. written 571 years ago. This version, therefore, gives the meaning of the G\u0101th\u0101s as they were understood in Sasanian times, when the Zoroastrian religion was in power.\n\nThe Sanskrit version is a translation of the Pahlavi, made by Dast\u016br Neryosang Dhaval, who flourished about A.D. 1200, as nearly as can be now ascertained. Whether the differences between the Sanskrit and Pahlavi versions be due to Neryosang himself, or to variations in the MS. he used, from those we now possess, is a question that remains to be settled. We have no reason to suppose that his knowledge of the meaning of the Avesta itself was superior to that of present scholars.\n\nThe Parsi-Persian version is transliterated from a modern Persian transliteration and translation of the Pahlavi, which is found in one of Haug's MSS. This was copied in 1865-6 from a Surat MS. of which no particular memorandum appears to have been preserved; but there is little probability of its being more than a century old. This version often indicates the correct reading of ambiguous Pahlavi words, but gives it in the antiquated form handed down by Parsi tradition. And it may be worth noting that\nHaug's copyist, in this instance, was a Muhammadan who seems to have done his work very carelessly, and to have made many omissions.\n\nThe free rhythmical translation appears to be given chiefly to indicate the rhythm of the original Avesta; but the reader will find a fairly literal translation in the \"Sacred Books of the East,\" vol. xxxi., interspersed with some excess of interpolated words in parentheses. The same volume also contains an introduction, which should be read as supplement to that of the work under review.\n\nAs Dr. Mills has explained, in his introduction to these materials, a Pahlavi version of an Avesta text cannot be translated in the same way as a purely Pahlavi text. In a Pahlavi version, the translator must first identify the words which are intended to translate those in the Avesta text. These, as a general rule, follow the same order as the words they translate, but are often interrupted by pure Pahlavi glosses which are parenthetical, and should be so marked. The translator has then two intermingled texts to attend to, the main thread of the sentence which is arranged in its Avesta order, and the parenthetical glosses which follow the Pahlavi order. The former must be translated so as to harmonize with the original Avesta, and the latter as pure Pahlavi explanations of the particular words to which they refer, which may sometimes not be easy to identify. After all, there is no particular difficulty in thus translating, if the translator is fairly acquainted with Pahlavi and does not lose sight of the meaning of the Avesta words, because the two versions mutually explain each other. It is when the translator launches out into a long Pahlavi commentary, without any Avesta compass to steer by, that he is most likely to run aground upon unexpected shoals and encounter unnoticed dangers. Such commentaries, however, are not found in the Pahlavi G\u0101th\u0101s, but refer chiefly to legal and ritualistic details, supplementary to the text of such works as the \"Vendid\u0101d\" and \"N\u012brangist\u0101n\"; and their style, though purely Pahlavi, is often quite as rugged and obscure as Dr. Mills confesses.\nthat his own commentary may be considered, if read apart from the text it refers to.\n\nE.

The Arabic Text edited from a MS. in the British Museum Library, with Translation and Notes. By Guy le Strange.\n\n(Continued from page 76.)\n\n[SECTION VI.]\n\nCANALS OF THE LOWER EUPHRATES.\n\nNow six leagues after the Nahr K\u016bth\u0101 has been led off from the Euphrates, this last divides into two branches. Of these the (true) Euphrates passes on down to (the town called) Kantara-al-K\u016bfa, then it runs past the city of Al-K\u016bfa, where there is a Bridge-of-Boats over it. And after this it flows into the Swamps.\n\nThe other branch (of the River) is also a mighty stream, which is greater even than the Euphrates itself and more broad. This is the channel called the Upper S\u016br\u0101 Canal. It passes by many villages and domains, and from it branch numerous canals which water the Districts of S\u016br\u0101, Bar-bissam\u0101, and B\u0101r\u016bsm\u0101. It passes in front of the city of Ka\u1e63r Ibn Hubayra, and between it and the town is less\nthan a mile of distance. Here there is a Bridge-of-Boats over the same, which is called the Jisr S\u016br\u0101.\n\nFrom the (Upper S\u016br\u0101) is brought (a canal) called the Nahr Abu Rah\u0101. Its beginning is at a place one league above the city of the Ka\u1e63r, and it falls into the S\u016br\u0101 again one league below Ka\u1e63r (Ibn Hubayra).\n\nThe Nahr S\u016br\u0101 runs on past the town of the Ka\u1e63r for a distance of six leagues, and then there is taken from it a canal called the Lower S\u016br\u0101. At the head of this canal there is a great bridge called the Kantara-al-K\u0101migh\u0101n, and the water pours through it with a mighty rush. This canal next passes by villages and cultivated lands, and from it branch numerous channels which water the districts of B\u0101bil,3 of Khutarniya, of Al-J\u0101mi\u2018\u0101n (the Two Mosques), and of Upper and Lower Al-Fall\u016bja. Now the (Lower S\u016br\u0101) Canal passes through the ruins of the city of B\u0101bil, and afterwards by the (town of the) Two Mosques (Al-J\u0101mi\u2018\u0101n), the New and the Old, and then it comes to \u1e24amd\u0101b\u0101d and Khutarniya and it passes Kuss\u012bn. From here there branch from it the channels which water the Districts of Junbul\u0101 and those that lie adjacent thereto. Finally, some way below Al-K\u016bfa and it its Saw\u0101d (or Plain) the (Lower S\u016br\u0101) falls into the canal which is brought from the Euphrates, and which is called Al-Bad\u0101t.4\n\nFrom the Lower S\u016br\u0101, aforesaid, is taken a canal called the Nahr-an-Nars.5 Its beginning is at the Old J\u0101mi\u2018 (Mosque). It flows by villages and domains, and from it divide the channels which irrigate the Saw\u0101d of Al-K\u016bfa, or some part thereof. It passes by Al-H\u0101rithiyya and by \u1e24amm\u0101m \u2018Omar. Now from the bridge of Al-K\u0101migh\u0101n to the head of the canal of An-Nars is six leagues, and from the head of the Nars Canal to \u1e24amm\u0101m \u2018Omar is likewise six leagues. Finally, the canal of An-Nars falls out into the canal of Al-Bad\u0101t, in the Saw\u0101d of Al-K\u016bfa, which lies to the eastward of the Euphrates.\n\nThen after the Upper S\u016br\u0101 has passed the bridge of Al-K\u0101migh\u0101n it receives the name of the Great \u1e62ar\u0101t,6 and it flows near Al-\u2018Akr and by (many) villages and domains.\nAfter passing \u0160\u0101barn\u012bth\u0101 there branch from it the channels which water the domains lying to the west of the canal. From it also is taken a canal called the Nahr \u0160ar\u0101t J\u0101m\u0101s. Its point of origin is at (the waterwheels called) An-Naw\u0101'\u012br, whence it flows, irrigating the domains in those parts, and finally rejoins the Great \u0160ar\u0101t at a point three leagues below the city of An-N\u012bl. The Great \u0160ar\u0101t itself flows past the city of An-N\u012bl, and there is here a bridge over it called Kan\u1e6dara-al-M\u0101si. After the canal has passed this bridge it takes the name of (the Canal of) An-N\u012bl. It flows next by villages and cultivated lands to a place called Al-H\u016bl, between which and (the town of) An-Nu'm\u0101niyya, on the bank of the Tigris, is less than a league's distance, and from this point they transport (goods to other boats) on the Tigris. But the canal (of An-N\u012bl) turns off here, and passes towards Nahr S\u0101bus, which is the name of a village lying on the Tigris bank; and the (canal) takes here the name of the Nahr S\u0101bus, flowing out into the Tigris one league below the village (of Nahr S\u0101bus).\n\nThese, therefore, are the streams which flow into, and are derived from, the river Euphrates, and these having now been described, there remains over for thee the specification of the streams which fall into, and are derived from, the Tigris. And these I will also explain clearly to thee, if it please Allah. May He be exalted!\n\n---\n\n1 The distances here given agree very fairly with the point on the modern map where the Hindiyya Canal, by Ibn Serapion regarded as the main stream of the Euphrates (see Section II. note 7), branches from the S\u016br\u0101 arm, which, in his day, was the name given to part of what is the present main channel of the Euphrates. On the Western or K\u016bfa arm lay the town of Al-Kan\u1e6dara (the Bridge), where one of the roads from Baghd\u0101d to Al-K\u016bfa crossed the stream. This place, according to Ibn Rusta (p. 182), who names\nthe town under the plural form of the word, viz. Al-Kan\u0101\u1e6d\u012br, lay twenty-seven miles southward of the Bridge-of-Boats at S\u016br\u0101, and twenty-eight miles above the city of Al-K\u016bfa. The town of Al-Kantara, or Al-Kan\u0101\u1e6d\u012br, is, I presume, the place which Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 180) names Kan\u0101\u1e6d\u012br of the Bani D\u0101r\u0101, for distinction. The city of Al-K\u016bfa has already been noticed (Section II. note 8).\n\nThe eastern arm of the Euphrates, and its present main-channel, was formerly called the Nahr S\u016br\u0101, a name which in Ibn Rusta always appears under the older form of As-S\u016br\u0101n. This canal irrigated the S\u016br\u0101 district, which, according to Kud\u0101ma (p. 236), together with Barb\u012bsama and B\u0101r\u016bsama, formed part of the great province (or Ast\u0101n) of Middle Bihkub\u0101dh.\n\nThe city of Ka\u1e63r Ibn Hubayra lay on the Baghd\u0101d-K\u016bfa high-road, and according to Ibn Rusta (p. 182) it was fifteen miles south of K\u016bth\u0101, and two miles above the Bridge-of-Boats over the S\u016br\u0101 Canal. The ruins of Ka\u1e63r Ibn Hubayra are identified by M. de Goeje (Z.D.M.G. XXXIX. 6) with those now called Tubayba. Ibn Hawkal (p. 166) writes that in his day (tenth century A.D.) Ka\u1e63r Ibn Hubayra was the largest town between Baghd\u0101d and Al-K\u016bfa, and one of the most populous places of the Saw\u0101d District. It took its name from the Castle or Palace (Ka\u1e63r) built here by Yazir-ibn-\u2018Omar Ibn Hubayra, governor of Al-\u2018Ir\u0101k, under Marwan II., the last Omayyad Caliph. This castle, according to Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 123), Ibn Hubayra never finished, but after the fall of the Omayyads, the first of the Abbasid Caliphs, As-Saff\u0101h, taking up his residence here, proceeded to roof the chambers and enlarge the half-finished buildings, to which he gave the name of Al-H\u0101shi-miyya, in honour of his ancestor H\u0101shim. The people, however, preferred the old name, and Ka\u1e63r Ibn Hubayra it continued to be called.\n\nThe Canal of Abu Ra\u1e25\u0101 (meaning probably \u201cthe\nCanal of the Mill,\" unless Abu Rah\u0101 be taken as a man's name), is apparently mentioned by no other authority; and the same remark applies, I believe, to the Bridge of K\u0101migh\u0101n, where the Upper S\u016br\u0101 Canal bifurcated, forming the Lower S\u016br\u0101 and the Great \u1e62ar\u0101t. In general terms the Upper and Lower S\u016br\u0101 correspond with what is now the course of the Euphrates from Musayyib to Laml\u016bn, while the \u1e62ar\u0101t is the present Shatt-an-Nil.\n\nB\u0101bil (the ancient Babylon), Khu\u1e6darniya, and the two Fall\u016bjas (not to be confounded with the Al-Fall\u016bja near Al-Anb\u0101r) were four out of the six districts of the Province of Upper Bihkub\u0101dh, according to Kud\u0101ma (p. 236). Al-J\u0101mi\u2018\u0101n,* \"the Two Mosques,\" is what subsequently came to be known as Al-\u1e24illa, called for distinction \u1e24illa of the Bani Mazyad. Y\u0101\u1e33\u016bt (III. 861) says that the river at Al-\u1e24illa was the Nahr S\u016br\u0101, and at another place (II. 322) he relates how Al-J\u0101mi\u2018\u0101n came to be called Al-\u1e24illa, \"the Settlement,\" for it appears that Sayf-ad-Dawla of the Bani Mazyad, fleeing hither with his people for refuge in A.H. 495 (1102), his descendants after his days \"settled\" permanently at this place.\n\nHamd\u0101b\u0101d is mentioned in Mas\u2018\u016bdi (I. 215) as Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d, but no details are given. Kuss\u012bn is written Kiss\u012bn in Y\u0101\u1e33\u016bt (IV. 100), who states that it is a district of Al-K\u016bfa; and he mentions Junbul\u0101 (II. 126) as a station lying between W\u0101si\u1e6d and Al-K\u016bfa, \"from whence you go to Kan\u0101\u1e6dir of the Bani Dara\" (see above, note 1).\n\nThe point where the Canal of Al-Bad\u0101t leaves the Euphrates is unfortunately not fixed by Ibn Serapion. Y\u0101\u1e33\u016bt (I. 770, II. 31) and some other authorities give the pronunciation as Al-Bud\u0101t, but this is probably incorrect. Kud\u0101ma (p. 236) mentions Al-Bad\u0101t as a sub-district of the Ast\u0101n of Middle\n\n* Dual form of J\u0101mi\u2018, a Congregational-Mosque for the Friday Prayers.\nBihkub\u0101dh; and M. de Goeje gives good reasons (Z.D.M.G. XXXIX. 12) for thinking that, while the total length of this canal was about 22 leagues, the place where it left the Euphrates main-channel was at a short distance south (and west) of the S\u016br\u0101 Bridge. Below Niffar doubtless it finally flowed out into the Swamps.\n\nThe digging of the Nahr-an-Nars, Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 773) ascribes to Narsi-ibn-Bahr\u0101m, that is to the Sassanian Narses, son of Varahr\u0101n, King of Persia, who came to the throne in 292 A.D. It was, Y\u0101k\u016bt writes, a canal taken from the Euphrates, and on its banks lay many villages; no mention, however, is made of Al-H\u0101rithiyya in this position. \u1e24amm\u0101m \u2018Omar is mentioned by Mukaddasi (p. 134), who, however, gives the name as the Bath of Ibn \u2018Omar; it lay one march below Ka\u1e63r Ibn Hubayra and a like distance above Al-K\u016bfa. The line of the Nars Canal beginning at Hilla, is fixed by the town of Niffar, whose ruins still exist, and which Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 798) says lay on its bank.\n\nThe line of the canal called the Great \u1e62ar\u0101t, with its continuation, the Nil Canal, is (as already mentioned) marked on the modern map by the Shatt-an-Nil, and the ruins of the city of An-Nil also exist (see below, Note 7). The \u1e62ar\u0101t J\u0101m\u0101s is that which Bil\u0101dhuri (p. 254) and Y\u0101k\u016bt (III. 379) call the \u1e62ar\u0101t of J\u0101m\u0101sb, and which was dug by Hajj\u0101j, the celebrated Governor of Al-\u2018Ir\u0101k, under the Omayyads. J\u0101m\u0101sb, or, in Persian, J\u0101m\u0101sp, is the name of the great Mobed, or Fire-priest, who was Minister of King Gushtasp, and who helped to introduce the religion of Zoroaster into Persia. Why a canal should be called after him in Mesopotamia is not stated.\n\nThe village of Al-\u2018A\u1e33r, meaning \u201cthe Palace,\u201d is probably that mentioned by Y\u0101k\u016bt (III. 695) as of the B\u0101bil district, lying on the road towards Karbal\u0101,\nand which Al-\u1e24usayn, the Prophet's grandson, passed by as he went to the place of his martyrdom. S\u0101barn\u012bth\u0101 the same author mentions (III. 359) as of the K\u016bfa District and on the Upper Sib Canal, by which name, apparently, part of the Nil Canal was known in the thirteenth century A.D.\n\nThe city of An-Nil, according to Bil\u0101dhuri (p. 290), was founded by the Governor \u1e24ajj\u0101j, and made the chief town of the province when he dug the Nil Canal. Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 861) says that the canal was named after the Nile of Egypt, which it was supposed to resemble. I believe that no other authority mentions the bridge called the Kan\u1e6dara-al-M\u0101si. It is perhaps worth noting that, according to Abu-l-Fid\u0101 (p. 53), it was the reach of the canal below (not above, and west of) the city of An-Nil, which in his day bore the name of As-\u1e62ar\u0101t.\n\nAl-H\u016bl, or Al-Hawl, near An-Nu'm\u0101niyya, is not mentioned by any other authority. As will be explained below (Section XII. note 1), this name is applied to a place where a canal spreads out to form a lake of clear water, free from reeds. The village of Nahr S\u0101bus, on the canal of this name, has been already mentioned (Section I. note 9). From Y\u0101k\u016bt (II. 903) we learn that in his day (thirteenth century A.D.) the Nil Canal, from the town of An-Nil to opposite An-Nu'm\u0101niyya, was known as the Upper Z\u0101b Canal, while the Lower Z\u0101b Canal was what Ibn Serapion here calls the Nahr S\u0101bus.\n\n[SECTION VII.]\n\nAFFLUENTS OF THE TIGRIS.\n\nAmong these is a stream called Nahr-adh-Dh\u012bb,\u00b9 and it flows into the Tigris. Its source is in a mountain in longitude 68\u00b0 30', and in latitude 39\u00b0 5'. Coming down\nfrom the district of Arzan, it falls into the Tigris under longitude 68\u00b0 20', and latitude 36\u00b0 30'.\n\nThere also flows into the (Tigris) a river called [F\u0101f\u0101n]. Its source is at a spring in a mountain under longitude 49\u00b0 5', or 69\u00b0 5', and latitude 34\u00b0 20'. Its junction with the Tigris is in longitude 69\u00b0 55' (or 15'), and latitude 36\u00b0 30'.\n\nThere also falls into the (Tigris) the river called B\u0101s\u0101nta. Its source is in the country of May\u0101f\u0101rik\u012bn, and it falls into the Tigris on its eastern bank, five leagues above the town of Jaz\u012bra-Ibn-\u2018Omar.\n\nThere likewise falls into the (Tigris) the (two) rivers called Az-Z\u0101b. The source of one of them is in a mountain under longitude 71\u00b0 30', and latitude 38\u00b0 30'. It falls into the Tigris on its eastern bank, under longitude 69\u00b0 30', and latitude 35\u00b0 30'. The second Az-Z\u0101b has its source in longitude 72\u00b0 5', and latitude 38\u00b0 5'; and it falls into the Tigris, on its eastern bank, under longitude 69\u00b0 40', and latitude 35\u00b0 5'.\n\nThere also falls into the (Tigris) a river called Ath-Tharth\u0101r. It flows out from the river Al-Hirm\u0101s, which is the river of Na\u1e63ib\u012bn; and passing on it cuts through a mountain which lies across its course. Thence flowing through the plain it passes Al-\u1e24adr, and on through the plain of Sinj\u0101r. Finally it falls into the Tigris, on the western bank of the same, at a distance of two leagues above the city of Takr\u012bt.\n\nNow [below]\u2020 the Fortress of \u1e24i\u1e63n Kayfa, there also flows into the (Tigris) [the river called Sarbat \u2020], but we need not describe it; also (the river) S\u0101tidam\u0101d, but this neither do we need to describe.\n\n---\n\n1 Nahr-adh-Dh\u012bb, \"the Wolf River,\" is evidently the stream now called Arzan S\u016b, on which lie the ruins of\n\n* Conjectural reading, MS. F\u0101fas or Fa\u1e33as.\n\u2020 Conjectural emendations.\nthe city of Arzan. This town must not be confounded with Arzan-ar-R\u00fbm or Erzeroum. Y\u00e2k\u00fbt (III. 68), who does not mention this Nahr-adh-Dhib, calls the river of Arzan the W\u00e2d\u00ee-as-Sarbat, and the same name is given to it in a note to the text of Istakhri (p. 76, note k); where Arzan is described as a city without walls, but defended by a strong castle. Y\u00e2k\u00fbt (I. 205) counts this town as of Armenia, but says that in his day (thirteenth century A.D.) it was already a ruin.\n\nIn the MS. this name is written without diacritical points on the third letter, which may therefore be either f or k, F\u00e2f\u00e2s or F\u00e2kas. Neither of these names, however, occur in any of our authorities, and I am inclined to believe that F\u00e2f\u00e2n (as printed in my text) is the true reading. The spring called \u2018Ayn-Tall-F\u00e2f\u00e2n is mentioned by Mukaddasi (pp. 141, 145), who gives this river the name of Razm. The town of Tall-F\u00e2f\u00e2n lay between the Tigris and this river, and was noted for its gardens, its cheap food, and good markets. The houses were built of sun-dried bricks. From the description of Y\u00e2k\u00fbt (II. 552, 773, III. 845) it is evident that the river of F\u00e2f\u00e2n, which he names (following Mukaddasi) the W\u00e2d\u00ee-ar-Razm, is the Bubtan S\u00fb of our maps, often called the Eastern Tigris\u2014of which one tributary is the river from Bitlis. The waters of the Razm (Y\u00e2k\u00fbt writes) so increase the stream of the Tigris as to make it navigable for boats below F\u00e2f\u00e2n.\n\nFrom the distance of five leagues above Jaz\u00eera-Ibn-\u2018Omar, the B\u00e2s\u00e2nfa is evidently identical with the river called B\u00e2\u2018ayn\u00e2tha by Yak\u00fbt (II. 552) and Bakri (pp. 151, 168). The MS. of Ibn Serapion is here rather uncertain, but Abu-l-Fid\u00e2 (p. 55) has copied this paragraph verbatim, and in the Paris edition of his text the word B\u00e2s\u00e2nfa is clearly printed. This name apparently occurs in no other\nauthority. The country of May\u0101f\u0101rik\u012bn, it will be seen on the map, lies a very long way from this river, which is that on which the modern town of Man\u1e63\u016briyya stands (see Ritter, XI. 120). Y\u0101k\u016bt (I. 472) describes B\u0101\u2018ayn\u0101th\u0101 (in the thirteenth century A.D.) as a village almost as large as a town, lying at the junction of its river with the Tigris. The gardens here were so extensive as to recall those of Damascus.\n\nThe two Z\u0101bs have already been mentioned (Section I. note 2). The Greater, or Upper, Z\u0101b, according to Y\u0101k\u016bt (II. 552), flows down from the Adharbayj\u0101n mountains, and joins the Tigris at Al-Haditha; while the Lesser, or Lower, Z\u0101b, whose source is in the country of Shahraz\u016br, flows into the Tigris at As-Sinn. Both these towns have disappeared from our modern maps. The river Ath-Tharth\u0101r has already been described (Section III. note 8).\n\nThe last paragraph of this section is corrupt in the MS. \u1e24i\u1e63n Kayfa is the well-known fortress still marked on our maps, and which was called Kiphas and Cephe by the classical geographers. Mu\u1e33addasi (p. 141) writes that it is a place full of excellent things, with a strong castle and many churches. If Nahr Sarba\u1e6d be the true reading of the MS., this according to Y\u0101k\u016bt (II. 552, III. 68) is the name of the river which flows past Arzan, and which Ibn Serapion has already mentioned under the name of Wolf River (see above, Note 1.) This is said (by Y\u0101k\u016bt) to flow down from a place in Armenia, which the MSS. variously give as Kh\u016bw\u012bt, Kh\u016bnat, or Kh\u016bd\u012bt.\n\nS\u0101tid\u0101m\u0101d (written in the MS. without diacritical points) is evidently the river S\u0101tidam\u0101 of Y\u0101k\u016bt (II. 552, III. 7), which rises in the mountain of the same name, which, according to Y\u0101k\u016bt, is a continuation of the B\u0101rimm\u0101 range (see Section III. note 8). From his description the S\u0101tidam\u0101, which\nhad many tributaries, may be identified with the present Batman Su, one of whose affluents is the river flowing down from May\u0101f\u0101r\u012bk\u012bn.\n\n[SECTION VIII.]\n\nACCOUNT OF THE CANALS WHICH ARE BROUGHT FROM THE (Tigris) AND WHICH FLOW BACK ENTIRELY INTO THE SAME.\n\nFrom the western* side of the Tigris is taken a canal called Al-Ish\u0101k\u012b.\u2020 Its beginning is a short distance below Takr\u012bt, and it passes to the westward of the Tigris, having on its banks both domains and cultivated lands. It flows on by [Tirh\u0101n],\u2021 and then comes to the Palace of Al-Mu'tasim, known as Ka\u1e63r-al-Ja\u1e63\u1e63. Here it irrigates the domains extending westward of the city of Surra-man-raa (Samarr\u0101), which are specified as the First, the Second, the Third, and so on up to the number Seven. Finally the (canal) flows out into the Tigris opposite Al-Ma\u1e6d\u012bra.\n\nFrom the (Tigris) also, but from its eastern side, is taken the canal called the Upper Al-K\u0101\u1e6d\u016bl-al-Kisraw\u012b (of the Chosroes). Its point of origin is a little way below D\u016br-al-H\u0101rith. From here it flows on, skirting the Palace of Al-Mutawakkil, which is known as Al-Ja'far\u012b, and here there is over it a stone bridge. From this place it passes on to Al-\u012at\u0101khiyya and here there is over it a bridge called Kantara Kisrawiyya (of the Chosroes). Thence it passes on to Al-Mu\u1e25ammadiyya, and here there crosses it (the Bridge-of-Boats called) Jisr Zaw\u0101rik. Thence it passes on to Ash-Sh\u0101dhurw\u0101n, and thence to Al-Mam\u016bniyya, which is a large village, next it reaches Al-Kan\u0101t\u012br. Now all these are fertile villages, and domains lying contiguous each to the other. Thence the (canal) passes on to a village called \u0160\u016bl\u0101 (or \u0160alw\u0101),\u00a7 and next to B\u0101'ak\u016bb\u0101, and here it changes its name to T\u0101marr\u0101. From this place it passes on to B\u0101j\u012bsr\u0101,\n\n* The MS. reads \"eastern\" in error.\n\u2020 Conjectural emendation, MS. \u1e6cayr\u0101n.\nand comes to the Bridge-of-Boats called Jisr-an-Nahraw\u0101n. Here the canal is itself known as the Nahraw\u0101n. From thence it flows by the Upper Ash-Sh\u0101dhurw\u0101n, then on to Jisr B\u016br\u0101n, next, passing by \u2018Abart\u0101, it comes to Yarzat\u012bya, and thence to the Lower Ash-Sh\u0101dhurw\u0101n. Now these are all beautiful villages and domains. From these the canal passes on to Usk\u0101f-Bani-l-Junayd, which is a city lying on both its banks, for the canal divides the same into halves. Thence it passes on between villages that lie contiguous each to the other, and domains which extend down to where its waters finally flow out into the Tigris, on the eastern bank of the same, a short distance below M\u0101dhar\u0101y\u0101.\n\n---\n\n1 I have been unable to discover after whom the Ish\u0101k\u012b Canal takes its name. It is only mentioned in Y\u0101k\u016bt\u2019s Dictionary once (IV. 844), incidentally; and among early authorities, Y\u0101k\u016bb\u012b (p. 264) is the only reference I can give. This author, when describing Samarr\u0101, refers to the Nahr-al-Ish\u0101k\u012b, which (he writes) irrigated the gardens and lands on the western side of the Tigris opposite Samarr\u0101. In the MS. of Ibn Serapion the canal is said to \u201cpass by \u1e6cir\u0101n,\u201d a place-name which is mentioned by no other authority. For this I propose to read \u1e6cirh\u0101n, which was one of the districts near Samarr\u0101. Ya\u2018k\u016bb\u012b (pp. 255 and 257) mentions At-\u1e6cirh\u0101n as the name of the plain on part of which Samarr\u0101 was built, and Ibn Kurd\u0101dbih (p. 94) includes it among the districts belonging to Mosul. Written \u1e6cirh\u0101n, the name is often mentioned in the Syrian Chronicle of Thomas of Marg\u0101 (see E. A. W. Budge, The Book of Governors, II. 290).\n\nKa\u1e63r-al-Ja\u1e63\u1e63, \u201cthe Gypsum Palace,\u201d is described by Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 110) as situated above the Palace named Al-H\u0101r\u016bn\u012b, which the Caliph Al-W\u0101thik built at Samarr\u0101 (cf. Bil\u0101dhuri, p. 297).\nThe position of Al-Ma\u1e6d\u012bra is fixed by Ibn Serapion (see below, Section IX.). Ya\u1e33\u016bb\u012b also refers to it, in several passages, as the limit reached by the buildings of Samarr\u0101, downstream, on the eastern bank; Ya\u1e33\u016bb\u012b further (p. 259), confirming Ibn Serapion, also states that it lay two leagues distant from Samarr\u0101. According to Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 568) Ma\u1e6d\u012bra took its name from a certain Ma\u1e6dar, son of Fazara of the Shayb\u0101n tribe, who was of the sect of the Kharijites. The place (he says) was originally called Al-Ma\u1e6dariyya, after him; which name in course of time became changed into Al-Ma\u1e6d\u012bra.\n\nThe line of the great K\u0101\u1e6d\u016bl-Nahraw\u0101n Canal still exists, and has been surveyed (cf. papers by Captain F. Jones, R.N., Records). This great canal, originally dug by the Sassanian Kings, was brought into working order by the Caliphs and served to irrigate the lands on the eastern bank of the Tigris, from a point more than a hundred miles north of Baghd\u0101d, to a like distance downstream, to the south-east of the capital. The greater number of the places mentioned by Ibn Serapion as lying on the canal, unfortunately, now no longer exist, and the numerous ruins which stud its banks are apparently for the most part nameless.\n\nD\u016br, where the canal took its origin, still exists. This name was common to many places in Al-\u012ar\u0101\u1e33. Y\u0101k\u016bt (II. 615) mentions seven D\u016brs, and there were two between Samarr\u0101 and Takr\u012bt. This D\u016br, which Ibn Serapion surnames, of Al-H\u0101rith, Bil\u0101dhuri (p. 297) gives as D\u016br-al-\u2018Arab\u0101y\u0101.\n\nThe ruins of the Palace of Al-Mutawakkil (called Al-Ja\u02bffari from the name of that Caliph) still exist. Bil\u0101dhuri (p. 298) says that a city, called Al-Mutawakkiliyya, grew up round the palace, with which were incorporated both the neighbouring town of D\u016br (mentioned above) and the village of Al-M\u0101\u1e25\u016bza.\nAl-\u012at\u0101khiyya took its name from \u012at\u0101kh, the Turk, a captain of the Body-guard of Al-Mu\u2019ta\u015fim. Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 430) states that the name of the place was originally a monastery called Dayr Abi \u015eufra, being called after one of the Kharijites, and that Al-Mutawakkil at a still later period changed the name a second time from Al-\u012at\u0101khiyya to Al-Mu\u1e25ammediyya, in honour of his son Mu\u1e25ammad, afterwards the Caliph Al-Munta\u015fir. Possibly this may be the Mu\u1e25ammediyya, mentioned by Ibn Serapion as coming next below Al-\u012at\u0101khiyya.\n\nOther authorities make no mention of either Kantara Kisrawiyya, \u201cthe Bridge of the Chosroes\u201d; or of Jisr Zaw\u0101r\u012bk, \u201cthe Bridge-of-Boats.\u201d\n\nThe village of Al-Ajama, \u201cthe Thicket,\u201d is mentioned above (Section I. note 4), but the name apparently occurs in no other author; the same remark applies to the three villages of Ash-Sh\u0101dhurw\u0101n, \u201cthe Weir,\u201d Al-Mam\u016bniyya, and Al-Kan\u0101\u1e6d\u012br, \u201cthe Bridges.\u201d\n\nThe name spelt \u015e\u016bl\u0101, in this passage of the MS., is written \u015ealw\u0101 a few lines below. Ibn Rusta (p. 90) calls it B\u0101b \u015ealw\u0101, and this is shortened in the Tunbih (p. 53) to B\u0101\u015falw\u0101. Ibn Khurd\u0101dbih (p. 175) also gives the name as \u015ealw\u0101, but Abu-l-Fid\u0101 (p. 55) has \u015e\u016bl\u0101, as in the first passage of Ibn Serapion. Other authorities do not mention this town. Hence, except that it lay on the K\u0101\u0163\u016bl Canal, nothing is known of it. It is not marked on the modern maps, but its position is more or less fixed by the fact that it stood four leagues below the junction of the Abu-l-Jund Canal with the great K\u0101\u0163\u016bl (see below, Section IX.).\n\nB\u0101\u2019ak\u016bb\u0101, according to Y\u0101k\u016bt (I. 472), is a large village belonging to the Upper Nahraw\u0101n district, and lies ten leagues distant from Baghd\u0101d. The place still exists. Following the same authority (I. 454), B\u0101jisr\u0101 is a small town also about ten\nleagues distant from Baghd\u0101d, but rather more to the eastward of the capital, on the \u1e24ulw\u0101n road. It stood in a well-cultivated district, and was surrounded by palm-trees.\n\nAt the Bridge-of-Boats called Jisr-an-Nahraw\u0101n stood the town of Nahraw\u0101n, which Ibn Rusta (p. 163) describes as occupying both banks of the canal, there being markets and a mosque in both quarters of the town, eastern and western. Round the mosques, especially that in the eastern quarter, were resthouses (Kh\u0101ns) for travellers and pilgrims. Nahraw\u0101n town lay four leagues distant from Baghd\u0101d, on the \u1e24ulw\u0101n road, and its site is marked in modern times by the town called Sifwa.\n\nAsh-Sh\u0101dhurw\u0101n-al-A\u02bfl\u0101, \u201cthe Upper Weir,\u201d and the Bridge-of-Boats at Jisr B\u016br\u0101n, are neither of them mentioned by other authorities. \u2018Abart\u0101, however, still exists. Y\u0101k\u016bt (III. 604) describes it as a town of Persian origin, where there was a great market. Raz\u0101\u1e6diya, or Yarz\u0101\u1e6diya (for the MS. is indistinctly written), mentioned as below \u2018Abart\u0101, is possibly wrongly placed in the MS. of Ibn Sera-pion, and should come above \u2018Abart\u0101. None of the other geographers mention this town, except Mas\u02bf\u016bd\u012b in the Tanb\u012bh (p. 53), who gives the name as Burz\u0101\u1e6diy\u0101, and he places it below \u2018Abart\u0101. A place called Zateriyeh, however, is marked in Kiepert\u2019s map above and west of \u2018Abart\u0101, and Jones (p. 38) gives this name as Resatiyeh. Ash-Sh\u0101dhurw\u0101n-al-Asfal, \u201cthe Lower Weir,\u201d is not marked on the maps or mentioned by other authorities.\n\nUsk\u0101f of the Banu-l-Junayd has been identified with the ruins marked Semak, or Sumakeh (Jones, p. 97). Y\u0101k\u016bt (I. 252), who pronounces the name Isk\u0101f, says the Banu-l-Junayd were chiefs of this district and celebrated for their hospitality. He adds that there were two places of this name, Upper and Lower Isk\u0101f, both of the Nahraw\u0101n District, whose lands,\nin his day (thirteenth century A.D.), had completely fallen out of cultivation, for the Nahraw\u0101n Canal (Y\u0101k\u016bt adds) had gradually silted up, and the Saljuk Sultans had been too much occupied in their disputes to find time for dredging and mending the dykes; \"further, their armies made a road-way of this same canal, whereby the district and the canal have gone to ruin.\"\n\nM\u0101dhar\u0101y\u0101, where the Nahraw\u0101n ran out into the Tigris, is placed by Ya'k\u016bb\u012b (p. 321) immediately to the south of Jabbul, and before you come to Al-Mub\u0101rik, which last lay opposite Nahr S\u0101bus. He adds that M\u0101dhar\u0101y\u0101 was in former times inhabited by Persian nobles. Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 381) adds that the village in his day was for the most part in ruin, that it lay opposite Nahr S\u0101bus, and was of the Fam-\u0101s-Silh district.\n\n[SECTION IX.]\n\nFrom the Tigris also are taken the Three (lesser) K\u0101\u1e6d\u016bls. The beginning of all three is at one place, namely some two leagues below Surra-man-raa, at a point between Al-Ma\u1e6d\u012bra and Barkuwa\u1e5b\u0101.\u00b9 The Upper K\u0101\u1e6d\u016bl of the (three) is called Al-Yah\u016bd\u012b. There is over it the bridge called Kan\u1e6dara Wa\u1e63\u012bf. From this point it passes on for some length, till (finally) it falls into the (great) K\u0101\u1e6dul-al-Kisr\u0101w\u012b (of the Chosroes) below Al-Mam\u016bniyya.\n\nThe second (K\u0101\u1e6d\u016bl), which is called Al-Mam\u016bn\u012b, and is the middle one, passes along by villages and domains which form a district of the Saw\u0101d, and (finally) falls into the (foresaid) K\u0101\u1e6d\u016bl-al-Kisr\u0101w\u012b, below the village of Al-Kan\u0101\u1e6d\u012br.\n\nThe third (K\u0101\u1e6d\u016bl), which is called that of Abu-l-Jund,\u00b2 and is the lowest of the three, but the finest of them all, and the best cultivated along both its banks, flows between many villages and domains. From it branch channels which irrigate the domains lying on the eastern bank of\nthe Tigris, and in this way the most part of its waters flow back into the Tigris. The main canal passes on to \u1e6caffir, and here there is a Bridge-of-Boats over it. From thence it passes on to the K\u0101\u1e6dul-al-Kisraw\u012b, (joining it) at a point four leagues above \u0160\u016bl\u0101 (or \u0160alw\u0101).\n\nFrom the T\u0101marra is taken a canal called Al-Kh\u0101li\u1e63. It runs between villages and domains and many (minor) canals are derived from it. It is a great waterway, and boats can pass up and down. It falls ultimately into the Tigris on its eastern bank, some two leagues below Ar-R\u0101shidiyya.\n\nFrom the Nahraw\u0101n also is taken a canal called the Nahr Diy\u0101l\u0101. Its point of origin is one mile below Al-Jisr (the Bridge-of-Boats at Nahraw\u0101n). It flows by villages and domains, and finally falls into the Tigris three leagues below Baghd\u0101d.\n\nNow from the Tigris, at various points below the city of W\u0101sit, are taken many canals which either fall into the Swamp or else flow one into the other. Of these we have already mentioned (the main-channel, which is) the largest and finest (see Section I.). Among the rest is a canal called Nahr B\u0101n, which begins below W\u0101sit at a village known as Nahr B\u0101n. Thence it passes by villages and domains, and turning about it finally flows out into the Swamp.\n\nThere is also taken from the Tigris a canal called the Nahr Kuraysh. Its point of origin is at a village likewise called Nahr Kuraysh. It flows by villages and domains, and finally falls into the Swamp to the west of [W\u0101sit].\n\nThere is also taken from the Tigris a canal called As-S\u012bb. This is S\u012bb-al-\u02bfUkr, and the city of Al-\u02bfUkr lies on its banks. Its point of origin is two leagues below Nahr B\u0101n. It flows on through villages and domains, passing by Al-Jaw\u0101mid, and from it many (minor) canals are derived. Finally, after turning about, it falls into the Swamp.\n\nFrom the Tigris also is taken the canal called Burd\u016bd\u0101. Its point of origin is at a village called Ash-Shad\u012bdiyya. It is a fine canal, and it flows out into the Swamp.\n\nSuch, therefore, are the Canals which fall into the\nTigris and which are derived from the same; and we have so detailed them unto thee that thou shouldst understand the matter.\n\n1 Barkuw\u0101r\u0101, where the three lesser K\u0101\u1e6d\u016bls branch from the Tigris, lay close beside Al-Ma\u1e6d\u012bra (see Section VIII. note 2). Barkuw\u0101r\u0101 is mentioned by Ya\u1e33\u016bb\u012b, where the name is spelt Balkuw\u0101r\u0101 (p. 265 and cf. note d, where other readings are given). The variant Bazkuw\u0101r occurs in Y\u0101\u1e33\u016bt (I. 605), and Jones (p. 47) gives Bez-guara as the name of a place at this spot. Possibly, therefore, Bazkuw\u0101r\u0101 is the correct reading, for the difference in Arabic between s and r lies in the addition of a diacritical point.\n\nThe bridge called Kan\u1e6dara Wa\u1e63\u012bf doubtless took its name from Wa\u1e63\u012bf, a celebrated captain of the Turk Body-guard under Al-Mu\u02bfta\u1e63im.\n\n2 The third and lowest of the minor K\u0101\u1e6d\u016bls is apparently the only one of which any trace is found on our maps. According to Bil\u0101dhur\u012b (p. 297) it derived its name of Abu-l-Jund, \u201cFather, or Supplier, of the Soldiers,\u201d from the fact that the crops, raised on the lands watered by it, served to supply the rations of the troops. It was dug by \u1e24ar\u016bn-ar-Rash\u012bd, who built a palace here while superintending its construction. In regard to the name K\u0101\u1e6d\u016bl it may be mentioned that Y\u0101\u1e33\u016bt (IV. 16) asserts that the word etymologically signifies \u201ca cut,\u201d and hence it was applied to a trench dug or cut in the ground.\n\n\u1e6caff\u012br is apparently the place mentioned by Jones (p. 47) under the name Tafra. Y\u0101\u1e33\u016bt (III. 539) says that he had himself visited \u1e6caff\u012br, which was a waterless and pastureless plain, where wild animals dwelt, lying between B\u0101\u02beak\u016bb\u0101 and Dak\u016bk\u0101, on the road from Baghd\u0101d to Arbil. No habitations were here to be met with, and Y\u0101\u1e33\u016bt adds that his guide,\nwhen the caravan travelled by night over this plain, \"was wont to take his direction by the Pole-Star, until, with the day, the plain had been crossed.\"\n\nThe point where the Nahr-al-Kh\u0101l\u012b\u1e63 left the T\u0101marr\u0101 is not specified. Ar-R\u0101shidiyya, the place two leagues above which the Kh\u0101l\u012b\u1e63 flowed out into the Tigris, is not mentioned by any other geographer, but possibly may be identified with the present Khor R\u0101shidiyya, immediately to the north of the ruins called Bedran (Al-Barad\u0101n). From this passage and what our author adds further of the Nahr-al-Kh\u0101l\u012b\u1e63 when describing the canals of Eastern Baghd\u0101d (see Section X.) it is evident that the Kh\u0101l\u012b\u1e63 of the tenth century A.D. is not identical with the canal of that name marked in Kiepert\u2019s map, which last flows at some distance to the north-west of B\u0101\u2019ak\u016bb\u0101; hence a good deal higher up than the Kh\u0101l\u012b\u1e63 of Ibn Serapion.\n\nThe Nahr Diy\u0101l\u0101 of Ibn Serapion coincides generally with the lower reach (south of Sifwa) of the present stream of the same name. But from our texts it is evident that the names Diy\u0101l\u0101, T\u0101marr\u0101, and Kh\u0101l\u012b\u1e63 were applied at different epochs to different streams. The account in Ibn Serapion (tenth century A.D.) does not agree with what is given in Y\u0101k\u016bt (thirteenth century A.D.), still less with the nomenclature of the modern map. Y\u0101k\u016bt (I. 812 and II. 638) says that the T\u0101marr\u0101 is identical with the Kh\u0101l\u012b\u1e63 Canal, which also is identical with the Diy\u0101l\u0101; and he goes on to describe, how the bed of the T\u0101marr\u0101 was artificially paved, for a length of seven leagues, in order to prevent its waters cutting through the soil, and how seven streams were taken from its lower course to irrigate a like number of districts on the hither side of Eastern Baghd\u0101d.\n\nAlthough there is no blank space left in the MS., the name of a place must have dropped out at this point, and I have supplied \u201cW\u0101sit\u201d in the text for want of any better suggestion.\nThe Nahr B\u0101n has been discussed above (Section I. note 11). Nahr \u1e32uraysh is not mentioned by any other authority.\n\nThe Nahr-as-Sib is mentioned by Y\u0101k\u016bt (III. 209) as a canal, of the district of Al-Ba\u1e63ra, on which there were many large villages. In two other passages (III. 275 and 697) the same author speaks of \u2018Ukr, which he pronounces \u2018Akr, surnamed As-Sadan, \u201cof the Veil.\u201d It was one of the villages of Ash-Shur\u1e6da, a district lying between W\u0101sit and Al-Ba\u1e63ra, and was situated on the right (i.e. to the south-west) of one travelling down the Tigris. Ibn Rusta (p. 95) apparently refers to the same place under the name of \u2018Ukr-as-Sayd (\u201cof Fishing,\u201d or \u201cHunting\u201d), which he says was in his day (early tenth century A.D.) occupied by the people called Az-Zutt, that is the Indian Jhats, said to be identical with the gypsies.\n\nAl-Jaw\u0101mid (the plural form of J\u0101mida) means the \u201cdrained lands\u201d or those artificially \u201cdried,\u201d and reclaimed from the Swamps. Y\u0101k\u016bt (II. 10 and IV. 217) describes Al-J\u0101mida as a large village of the W\u0101sit district, that he had himself often visited.\n\nThe Burd\u016bd\u0101 canal and the village of Ash-Shadi-diyya are not to my knowledge mentioned by any other geographer.\nThe small \"Sketch-Plan of Baghdad\" referred to at p. 275 will be found opposite p. 33 in the January Part, and, when binding the 1895 Volume, should be placed to face p. 275.\nREFERENCES TO SKETCH-PLAN OF BAGHDAD.\n\nEASTERN BAGHDAD, OR 'ASKAR-AL-MANDI.\n\n1.

We begin with the canals that are on the eastern side of the Tigris, which is called \u2018Askar-al-Mahdi (the Camp of Al-Mahdi).\u2019\n\nOf these is the canal called the Nahr M\u016bs\u0101. Its place of origin is from the canal called Al-Nahr B\u012bn, at the back of the Palace of Al-Mu\u2019ta\u1e63id, known as Ka\u1e63r-ath-Thurayy\u0101 (the Palace of the Pleiades). Now the origin of the Nahr B\u012bn is from the Nahraw\u0101n (Canal), at a short distance above the Bridge-of-Boats (at the town of Nahraw\u0101n). Thence the Nahr B\u012bn passes on, with running waters, and from it branch many canals which irrigate the Saw\u0101d (or plain near) Baghd\u0101d. This canal passes to the east of the Palace of the Pleiades aforesaid, and on its banks are villages and domains. It next irrigates part of the district of Kalw\u0101dh\u0101, and finally flows out into the Tigris a little less than two leagues below Baghd\u0101d.\n\nThe Nahr M\u016bs\u0101, as already mentioned, is derived from the (Nahr B\u012bn), and its place of origin also has been described. Passing on the (Nahr M\u016bs\u0101) enters the Palace of the Pleiades, and turning round and about it, passes out again. Then it reaches a place called the Dividing of the Waters, and there it divides into three streams.\n\nThe first stream (which is the Nahr M\u016bs\u0101 itself) passes to B\u0101b S\u016bk-ad-Daw\u0101bb (the Gate of the Market for Beasts-of-Burden), and thence goes across (the gate called) B\u0101b \u2018Amm\u0101r. Here there is taken from it a canal which passes to (the Palace known as) D\u0101r-al-B\u0101n\u016bja, and there it disappears.\n\nThe Nahr M\u016bs\u0101 itself passes on after traversing the B\u0101b S\u016bk-ad-Daw\u0101bb, and comes to the B\u0101b Mu\u1e33ayyar-al-Kab\u012br (the great Pitched Gate). Here there is taken from it a\ncanal which passes to the D\u0101r (or House of) Ibn-al-Kha\u1e63\u012bb, which stands in the road called after Sa\u2019d-al-Wa\u1e63\u012bf. Next it passes out to Al-\u2018All\u0101f\u012bn, and here there falls into it the canal which Al-Mu\u2019taqid dug* for the Lake. Thence the canal passes by the road, which is behind the wine-shops, towards Al-\u2018All\u0101f\u012bn, and which is known as the road of the B\u0101b-al-Mukharrim. Then the canal passes under (the Bridge called) Kan\u1e6dara-al-\u2018Abb\u0101s, which is at (the Gate called) the B\u0101b-al-Mukharrim, and flowing along the road to (the quarter of) Al-Mukharrim, it disappears.\n\nThe Nahr M\u016bs\u0101 itself next goes on to (the Bridge called) Kan\u1e6dara-al-An\u1e63\u0101r; and here there are taken from it three canals. The first of these flows into the tank (\u1e24aw\u1e0d) of the An\u1e63\u0101r; the second into the tank of Hayl\u0101na; and the third into the tank of D\u0101\u016bd.\n\nThe Nahr M\u016bs\u0101 itself next passes on to the road (called) Darb-at-Taw\u012bl, and the Palace of Al-Mu\u2019tas\u012bm. Here there is taken from it a canal which passes to (the Market of) S\u016bk-al-\u2018A\u1e6dsh. After flowing along the centre of the road called Karm-al-\u2018Arsh, it finally falls into the D\u0101r (or House of the) Waz\u012br \u2018Ali-ibn-Mu\u1e25ammad-ibn-al-Fur\u0101t, and there disappears.\n\nThe Nahr M\u016bs\u0101 itself flows on skirting the Palace of Al-Mu\u2019tas\u012bm, and passes out into the Great Road. Next it comes to the road of \u2018Amr-ar-R\u016bm\u012b, and then enters (the Garden called) Bust\u0101n-az-Z\u0101hir, which is irrigated by it; lastly it falls into the Tigris a little way below this garden.\n\nThe Second Canal,4 at the Dividing (of the Waters), flows towards the (Gate called) B\u0101b Abraz, and here it enters Baghd\u0101d. This (canal) is called Nahr-al-Mu\u2019all\u0101. It flows between the houses to the B\u0101b S\u016bk-ath-Thul\u0101tha (the gate of the Tuesday Market). Next it enters the Palace of Al-Mu\u2019taqid, which is called Al-Fird\u016bs (Paradise), and after passing through and about it, flows out into the Tigris near this palace.\n\n* For this next line of text Al-Kha\u1e6d\u012bb has the following: \u201cAnd some of its (waters) pass to the B\u0101b S\u016bk al-Ghanam (the Gate of the Sheep-Market), and thence to the Trench of Al \u2018Abb\u0101s.\u201d\nThe Third Canal, at the Dividing (of the Waters), flows to the B\u0101b Ka\u1e6d\u012b'a M\u016bshaj\u012bn* (the Gate of the Fief of M\u016bshaj\u012bn). Thence it passes to the (gate called) B\u0101b-al-'\u0100mma; and next enters (the palace) called Ka\u1e63r-al-\u1e24asan\u012b, and, after passing round and about it, flows out into the Tigris near the Palace of Al-Mu\u1e33tafi, known as Ka\u1e63r-at-T\u0101j (the Palace of the Crown).\n\nFrom the Nahr B\u012bn, above mentioned, is taken a canal called the Nahr 'Ali. Its point of origin is at a short distance above (the head of) the Nahr M\u016bs\u0101. It passes across the highway of Khur\u0101s\u0101n to the village of Al-Athla; and flowing on irrigates the district of Nahr B\u016bk and the hamlet of Al-U\u1e63ru\u1e6dar. Finally, it falls into a canal from the Kh\u0101l\u012b\u1e63 (Canal).\n\nFrom the Nahr-al-Fa\u1e0dl (which will be described below) is brought a canal called the Nahr-al-Ja'fariyya. It flows by villages and domains and loses itself in the Saw\u0101d (or Plain) of Baghd\u0101d, which lies to the north of the city. From this Nahr-al-Ja'fariyya is brought a canal called Nahr-as-S\u016br (the Canal of the Wall), for it flows along the Wall of Baghd\u0101d. (As already said), its origin is from the Nahr-al-Ja'fariyya, and it flows by the (gate called the) B\u0101b Khur\u0101s\u0101n, and that called B\u0101b-al-Barad\u0101n. Finally, it flows out into the Nahr [al-Fa\u1e0dl]\u2020 which itself flows out into the Tigris near the (gate called) B\u0101b-ash-Shamm\u0101siyya.\n\nFrom the Nahr-al-Kh\u0101l\u012b\u1e63, which, as we have already stated (see Section IX.), falls into the Tigris below the place called Ar-R\u0101shidiyya, there is brought the canal (already mentioned) called Nahr-al-Fa\u1e0dl. It flows towards the (gate called) B\u0101b-ash-Shamm\u0101siyya, and in passing irrigates the domains and villages that lie along its banks. It finally flows out into the Tigris at the B\u0101b-ash-Shamm\u0101siyya (aforesaid). From this Canal of Ash-Shamm\u0101siyya, otherwise called the Nahr-al-Fa\u1e0dl, is taken a canal called the\n\n* The reading of this name is uncertain. Al-Kha\u1e6d\u012bb gives M\u016bshaj\u012br.\n\u2020 MS. reads Al-Kh\u0101l\u012b\u1e63, in error.\nNahr-al-Mahd\u012b. Its point of origin is a little way above the Gate (of Ash Shamm\u0101siyya); passing on it enters Baghd\u0101d by the B\u0101b-ash-Shamm\u0101siyya, and flows to the (market called) Suwayka Ja'far. Then, passing by the road known as the Road of the Nahr-al-Mahd\u012b, it reaches the (bridge called) Kan\u1e6dara-al-Barad\u0101n,7 whence it enters the (House of the Greeks) D\u0101r-ar-R\u016bmiyyin. Then it passes out to (the market called the) Suwayka-Nasr-ibn-M\u0101lik; and next, entering Ar-Ru\u1e63\u0101fa, it comes to the Great Mosque, and to (the garden called) Bust\u0101n \u1e24afs, where it (finally) falls into a tank which is in the interior of the Palace of Ar-Ru\u1e63\u0101fa.\n\nFrom this canal (of Al-Mahd\u012b) is taken a canal, the origin of which is in the Market of Na\u1e63r (aforesaid) at the Iron Gates (Al-Abw\u0101b-al-Had\u012bd). It passes along the centre of the road of the Gate of Khur\u0101s\u0101n, flowing on to where it finally falls into the Nahr [as-S\u016br] * near the Gate of Khur\u0101s\u0101n.\n\nThese, therefore, are the Canals (of Baghd\u0101d) on the eastern side of the Tigris, and there now remain the Canals of the western side; and these, if it please Allah, I will explain to thee.\n\n---\n\n1 In this and the two following sections on the Canals of Baghd\u0101d, the notes supply brief references for those places, only, which I have found mentioned by other authorities. It is not, however, intended to make them exhaustive. I hope to discuss the whole subject of the topography of Ancient Baghd\u0101d in a future paper; and have therefore limited myself, in this place, to what seemed absolutely necessary for the elucidation of the text of Ibn Serapion.\n\nThese three Sections (X., XI., XII.) on the Canals of Baghd\u0101d have been copied (and, as usual, without any acknowledgment and with many omissions) by Al-Kha\u1e6d\u012bb, in his History of Baghd\u0101d. This useful\n\n* MS. reads Nahr-al-F\u1e0dl, in error.\ncompilation has never yet been printed, but good MSS. of the work exist in the British Museum and the Paris Library.\n\nThe great eastern quarter of Baghd\u0101d, that lay on the Persian side of the Tigris, and which, during the last four centuries of the Abbasid Caliphate, became the main quarter of the capital, was originally only a suburb of the city of Al-Man\u1e63\u016br (see Section XI. note 1), of the western side of the Tigris. The eastern quarter, in the beginning, had been called \u2018Askar-al-Mahd\u012b, \u201cthe Camp of Al-Mahdi,\u201d son and successor of Al-Man\u1e63\u016br, for Al-Mahdi had encamped here with his troops in A.H. 151 (768) after returning from his expedition into Khur\u0101s\u0101n. Al-Mahdi subsequently built a palace near this camp, called Ar-Ru\u1e63\u0101fa, \u201cthe Cause-way,\u201d also a Mosque, and in after years, during his Caliphate, a city, composed of houses built on the fiefs granted to his followers, spread over the adjacent lands. Here the later Caliphs built their palaces, and \u2018Askar-al-Mahdi soon afterwards became the seat of government, the western quarter tending more and more to ruin.\n\nThe Nahr Bin, Y\u0101k\u016bt writes (IV. 836), is also called the Nahr B\u012bl, and its waters irrigate the lands of the district called Nahr B\u016bk. This last, it is to be remarked, was not the name of a canal (in spite of the word Nahr having that signification), but of a district. The land near Baghd\u0101d on the eastern side of the Tigris, was divided into two sections; up-stream and to the north with the river on the west, was the Nahr B\u016bk District; while downstream and south-east lay the District of Kalw\u0101dh\u0101, with the town of the same name on the Tigris bank.\n\nThis account of the Nahr M\u016bs\u0101 and its branches is repeated by Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 846) in a very much abridged form. The Palace of the Pleiades stood two miles distant from the palace on the Tigris bank,\ncalled Ka\u1e63r-al-\u1e24asani. Y\u0101k\u016bt describes (I. 924) an underground, vaulted passage-way, which the Caliph had built for connecting the two palaces, and along which his women could pass from one to the other without appearing in the streets.\n\nOf the places lying on the Nahr M\u016bs\u0101 and its branches, the following are mentioned by other writers. The Palace of Al-B\u0101n\u016bja (on the first branch canal), Al-Kha\u1e6d\u012bb (f. 89) states, belonged to a daughter of Al-Mahdi. Her name is also written B\u0101n\u016bka, \u201cLittle B\u0101n\u016b\u201d or Lady, and under this form occurs in Ibn \u1e32utayba (p. 193), who says that she died young. The second branch canal passed to the Palace of Ibn-al-Kha\u1e63\u012bb, who was Wazir of the Caliph Al-Munta\u1e63ir (cf. Fakhri, p. 285). The quarter of Al-Mukharrim, according to Bil\u0101dhur\u012b (p. 295), was so called from a man of this name who had settled here in the early days of Isl\u0101m, before Baghd\u0101d was founded. Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 441) describes this quarter as situated between the Ru\u1e63\u0101fa and Nahr-al-Mu\u02bfall\u0101 quarters. In after times the Buwayhid princes built their palaces here, as also some of the Salj\u016bk Sultans; but all this was subsequent to the date of Ibn Serapion.\n\nIn regard to the three Tanks, Y\u0101k\u016bt states (II. 362) that the \u1e24aw\u1e0d D\u0101\u016bd was called either after D\u0101\u016bd, son of the Caliph Al-Mahdi, or after one of his freedmen. It lay adjacent, he says, to the market called S\u016bk-al-\u02bfAtsh (see next paragraph). The \u1e24aw\u1e0d Hayl\u0101na was called after one of the wives of either Al-Mans\u016br or of H\u0101r\u016bn-ar-Rash\u012bd, who bore this name, and caused this tank to be dug. Of the Tank of the An\u1e63\u0101r, \u201cthe Auxiliaries,\u201d no details are given.\n\nThe Palace of Al-Mu\u02bfta\u1e63im, on the Nahr M\u016bs\u0101, is mentioned by Ya\u02bf\u1e33\u016bb\u012b (p. 255) as having been the residence of that Caliph between the years A.H. 218\u2013221, and immediately prior to his removal, with\nhis Turk body-guard, upstream to Samarra (see Section I. note 3). The S\u016bk-al-\u2018A\u1e6dsh, \u201cthe Famine Market,\u201d is described by Y\u0101\u1e33\u016bt (III. 194) as lying between the Ru\u1e63\u0101fa and the Nahr-al-Mu\u02bfall\u0101 quarters. It was built for the Caliph Al-Mahd\u012b by a certain Sa\u02bf\u012bd-al-Khursi, Chief of the Police, and merchants from the Karkh quarter (see Section XI. note 1) were brought over and settled here. It was at first proposed to call it S\u016bk-ar-Rayy, \u201cthe Market of Satiety,\u201d but the word \u2018A\u1e6dsh, \u201cFamine,\u201d took its place and persisted.\n\n\u2018Ali-Ibn-al-Fur\u0101t, whose palace stood near this, was three times Waz\u012br to the Caliph al-Mukta\u1e0dir (cf. Fakhri, p. 311). \u2018Amr-ar-R\u016bm\u012b, \u201cthe Greek,\u201d is probably the individual mentioned by Bil\u0101dhur\u012b (p. 323), as having been Freedman of the Caliph Al-H\u0101d\u012b, who named \u2018Amr governor of Kazwin in Persia. The Garden of Az-Z\u0101hir is referred to incidentally by Y\u0101\u1e33\u016bt (III. 195, IV. 441). It lay on the Tigris bank near where the Mosque called the Jami\u02bf-as-Sult\u0101n afterwards stood, and apparently was to the south of Ar-Ru\u1e63\u0101fa.\n\nThe second canal at the \u201cDivide\u201d was called after Al-Mu\u02bfall\u0101, Freedman of Al-Mahdi, and a great General under H\u0101r\u016bn-ar-Rash\u012bd. Y\u0101\u1e33\u016bt (IV. 845) says that this man held more governments than had ever been granted to any other individual\u2014having been Governor of Al-Ba\u1e63ra, F\u0101rs, Al-Ahw\u0101z, Al-Yam\u0101ma, and Al-Bahrain. The Nahr-al-Mu\u02bfall\u0101 gave its name to the great quarter of Baghd\u0101d in which the Palaces of the latter Caliphs stood.\n\nThe gate called the B\u0101b Abraz and the Tuesday-Market are both mentioned by Y\u0101\u1e33\u016bt (I. 774, III. 193), who gives the name of this gate under the form Biyabraz. Al-Fird\u016bs \u201cThe Palace of Paradise,\u201d is also referred to incidentally by the same author (IV. 845); and it took its water from the Mu\u02bfall\u0101 Canal.\nThe third canal at the \"Divide\" appears to have had no special designation. The Palace called Al-\u1e24asan\u012b received its name from Al-\u1e24asan Ibn Sahl, whose daughter B\u016br\u0101n was married to Al-Mam\u016bn (see Section I. note 9), Al-\u1e24asan being, at that time, Waz\u012br. Y\u0101k\u016bt (I. 805) relates that the Ka\u1e63r-al-\u1e24asan\u012b was the same Palace which under Ar-Rash\u012bd had been called the Ka\u1e63r Mam\u016bn\u012b, having been built by Ja\u02bffar, the Barmecide, for presentation to Al-Mam\u016bn, the heir-apparent. Ka\u1e63r-at-T\u0101j, \u201cthe Palace of the Crown,\u201d was built on land adjacent to the \u1e24asan\u012b Palace. It was begun by Al-Mu\u02bfta\u1e0did, according to Y\u0101k\u016bt (I. 808), but the Caliph left it half finished to build the Palace of the Pleiades (see note 3, above), and the T\u0101j was only completed under his son, the Caliph Al-Muktafi.\n\nAl-Athla is mentioned by Y\u0101k\u016bt (I. 118) as lying one league distant from Baghd\u0101d. Al-Ufr\u016b\u1e6d\u0101r is not given elsewhere; neither is there any mention made in Y\u0101k\u016bt of the various canals which branch from the Kh\u0101li\u1e63 going towards the Shamm\u0101siyya quarter. This quarter has been already noticed (Section I. note 6). Y\u0101k\u016bt (III. 317) describes it as lying adjacent to \u201cthe Greek House\u201d called D\u0101r-ar-R\u016bm, and above Ar-Ru\u1e63\u0101fa, in the upper part of Eastern Baghd\u0101d. Here, at a later date than Ibn Serapion, the Buwayhid prince, Mu\u02bfizz-ad-Dawla, built his great palace.\n\nThe bridge called Kan\u1e6dara-al-Barad\u0101n, after the village lying to the north of Baghd\u0101d (see Section I. note 6), gave its name to a quarter and a gate of the eastern city. Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 187) notes that the bridge was built by a certain As-Sar\u012b-ibn-al-Hu\u1e6d\u0101m. The D\u0101r-ar-R\u016bmiyy\u012bn, \u201cthe House of the Greeks,\u201d is the D\u0101r-ar-R\u016bm mentioned in the previous note, but this and the other places in or near Ar-Ru\u1e63\u0101fa are not further specified by Y\u0101k\u016bt. The Little Market (Suwayka) of Na\u1e63r, Y\u0101k\u016bt (III. 201) says, was called after a certain\nNa\u1e63r-ibn-M\u0101lik, of the Khuza\u2018a tribe. Al-Mahdi granted him the land here in fief; and he was father of the celebrated Ahmad-az-Z\u0101hid, \u201cthe Ascetic,\u201d who suffered persecution under the Caliph Al-W\u0101thik.\n\n[SECTION XI.]\n\nCanals of Western Baghd\u0101d.\u00b9\n\nOf these is the canal called A\u1e63-Sar\u0101t.\u00b2 Its origin is from the Nahr \u2018\u012as\u0101, at a short distance above the village of Great Al-Mu\u1e25awwal. Thence the canal passes, watering the domains and gardens of B\u0101d\u016bray\u0101, and many (minor) canals branch from it. Entering Baghd\u0101d, it passes the bridge called Kantara-al-\u2018Abb\u0101s, then goes on to the Kantara-as-Shiniy\u0101t, next it passes to the Kantara Rah\u0101-al-Batr\u012bk (the Bridge of the Patrician\u2019s Mill), which same is the Bridge of Az-Zabd; then it comes to the Kantara-al-\u2018Atika (the Old Bridge), next to the New Bridge (Kantara-al-Jadida), then, finally, the (Sar\u0101t Canal) flows out into the Tigris a little way below (the Palace called) Al-Khuld.\n\nFrom the Sar\u0101t is taken a canal called the Trench (Khandak) of T\u0101hir.\u00b3 It starts from the Canal of the Sar\u0101t, one league below the head of the same (that is where the Sar\u0101t itself branches from the Nahr \u2018\u012as\u0101). Flowing on (the Khandak) waters various domains, and, turning, passes round Baghd\u0101d in the part adjacent to (the quarter of) Al-Harbiyya. It first goes by the (gate called) B\u0101b-al-Anb\u0101r, and there is here a bridge (Kantara) over it. Then it passes B\u0101b-al-Hadid (the Iron Gate), where also there is a bridge. Next it comes to the B\u0101b Harb, where there is also a bridge, and then to the B\u0101b Ka\u1e6drabbul, and here there is the Kantara Rah\u0101-Umm-Ja\u2018far (the Bridge of the Mill of Umm-Ja\u2018far). Next passing through the midst of the Fief of Umm-Ja\u2018far, the (Trench) flows out into the Tigris a little way above the House (D\u0101r) of Ish\u0101\u1e33-ibn-Ibr\u0101h\u012bm the T\u0101hirid.\nFrom the Khanda\u1e33 (or Trench) is taken a canal called the Little Sar\u0101\u1e6d. This canal takes its way, cutting across the Gardens, and after passing by part of B\u0101d\u016bray\u0101, flows out finally into the Great Sar\u0101\u1e6d at a point a little way below the Patrician\u2019s Mill.\n\nFrom the Nahr \u2018\u012as\u0101 is taken a canal called Karkh\u0101y\u0101. It passes through the midst of the district of B\u0101d\u016bray\u0101, and there branch from it (many minor) canals which ramify throughout B\u0101d\u016bray\u0101, being called and named variously. Along both its banks are villages, domains, and gardens, which extend until it enters Baghd\u0101d at the (gate called) B\u0101b Abu-Kubaysa. After this it passes to the Kan\u1e6dara-al-Yah\u016bd (the Bridge of the Jew), and then on to the (bridge called) Kan\u1e6dara Darb-al-\u1e24ij\u0101ra. Next it passes to the Kan\u1e6dara-al-Bim\u0101rist\u0101n (the Bridge of the Hospital), and the (gate called) B\u0101b Mu\u1e25awwal, and here there branch from it all the canals of (the quarter of) Al-Karkh.\n\nNow the first of these canals has its point of origin immediately after the Karkh\u0101y\u0101 has passed the Bridge of the Bim\u0101rist\u0101n, and it is called Nahr Raz\u012bn. Passing along it is taken into the (Suburb called) Rabad \u1e24umayd, and, after going round and about therein, it passes out to (the Market called) Suway\u1e33a Abu-l-Ward. Thence it passes to the (Pool called) Birkat Zalzal, through which it flows, and next comes to (the gate called the) B\u0101b T\u0101\u1e33-al-\u1e24arr\u0101ni, and finally falls into the Great Sar\u0101\u1e6d immediately below the New Bridge. In this (latter) part the (Raz\u012bn) Canal is known as the Nahr Abu-\u2018At\u012bb. Now when the Nahr Raz\u012bn comes to the gate of the Market of Abu-l-Ward, there is taken from it a canal which passes by a K\u016braj (or Conduit), which carries (its waters across) the Old Bridge (Al-Kan\u1e6dara-al-\u2018At\u012bka, over the Great Sar\u0101\u1e6d). Flowing on from here, it goes along the road of the K\u00fcfa Gate, where (a canal) branches off from it which enters part of the remains of the (original) City of Al-Mans\u016br, and here its waters fail. From the Gate of K\u00fcfa, the main canal, after flowing along the\nRoad of the Ka\u1e25\u1e6daba's, comes to the B\u0101b-ash-Sh\u0101m (the Syrian Gate), whence, passing by the Road of the Jisr (or Bridge-of-Boats), it skirts the Zubaydiyya (Fief), and finally disappears there.\n\n(To return to) the Canal of Karkh\u0101ya. After passing Al-Bim\u0101rist\u0101n (the Hospital), it comes to the place called Ad-Darr\u0101b\u0101t, and here takes the name of Al-\u2018Am\u016bd. This is the stream from which branch the canals of the Inner (quarter of) Al-Karkh. The main canal next passes to a building adjacent, which is called the Mill of Abu-l-\u1e32asim, and thence to a place (inhabited by) the men of W\u0101sit. From thence it passes to a place called Al-Khaf\u1e33a, and there is now taken from it the (canal called) Nahr-al-Bazz\u0101zin (of the Cloth-merchants); here it turns about and comes out in the road of Al-Mu\u1e63awwir (the Painter). Thence it passes to the (house called) D\u0101r Ka\u2018b, and flows on to the Gate of Al-Karkh. Here it enters (the quarter of the Cloth-merchants, called) Al-Bazz\u0101zin, thence passing to that (of the Cobblers, called) Al-Kharr\u0101z\u012bn. Here it enters the quarter of the Soap-makers, and then finally flows out into the Tigris under the D\u0101r-al-Jawz (the House of the Nut).\n\n(Now to return to) the main canal, this passes on from Al-Khaf\u1e33a, to where it skirts the Murabba\u2018a-az-Zayy\u0101t (the Quadrangle of the Oil-merchant), and here there branches from it a canal called the Nahr-ad-Daj\u0101j (the Fowl\u2019s Canal). This last, turning off, extends to (the quarter of) the Canal-diggers, and thence passes to (the quarter of) the Reed-weavers, and the road of the Pitch-workers; and finally it falls out into the Tigris at the place of the Sellers of Cooked-food. (Returning to the main canal), this passes on from the Quadrangle of the Oil-merchant to Daww\u0101ra-al-\u1e24im\u0101r (the Mound of the Ass), and there turns off from it at this point a canal called Nahr-al-Kil\u0101b (the Dogs\u2019 Canal), which goes along the\n\n* Reading of MS. doubtful.\n\u2020 In the MS. this name may be read Al-Jazz\u0101rin, \u201cthe Butchers.\u201d\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1895.\nroad of the Fief of the Dogs, and flowing on finally falls into the Nahr '\u012as\u0101 at (the bridge called) Kantara-ash-Shawk. But the main canal passes on from the Daww\u0101ra-al-Himar to a place known as the Quadrangle of \u0160\u0101lih, and here there turns from it a canal called (after the Cooks who sell Fried-meats) Nahr-al-Kallay\u012bn, which passing on extends to (the place called) As-Saw\u0101k\u012bn, and thence to the Reed-weavers' quarter, where it flows out into the Nahr-ad-Daj\u0101j (before described), and from this point the two form one canal. (Returning to) the Quadrangle of \u0160\u0101lih, the main canal passes on to a place where it becomes the Nahr T\u0101bak, and then finally it falls into the Nahr '\u012as\u0101 at a place known as Mashra'at-al-\u0100s (the Myrtle-passage), which is over against the Melon-house (D\u0101r Battikh).\n\nSuch, therefore, are the Canals of (the quarter of) Al-Karkh; and there remain over the canals of the \u1e24arbiyya (quarter), and these, if it please Allah, may He be exalted! I will also detail unto thee.\n\n---\n\n1 In order to understand the following description, a few lines must be devoted to a summary account of the topography of ancient Baghd\u0101d. The original city, as founded by the Caliph Al-Man\u1e63\u016br, was circular, being surrounded by a double wall and ditch, with four equidistant gates. From gate to gate measured an Arab mile (about one English mile and a quarter), and the circumference being thus four Arab miles, the diameter of the town was rather over one mile. This circular city stood on the western side of the Tigris, immediately above the point where the Sar\u0101t Canal, coming from the Nahr '\u012as\u0101, joined the Tigris, and the Sar\u0101t flowed round the southern side of the city. The four gates were: first, the Ba\u1e63ra Gate, opening S.E. and down-stream, overlooking the Sar\u0101t where it was crossed by the New Bridge; second, the K\u016bfa Gate, opening S.W., and at a short distance above the Sar\u0101t, across which, by the Old Bridge,\nlay the great K\u016bfa high road; third, the Syrian Gate, opening N.W. on the \u1e24arbiyya quarter; and fourth, the Khur\u0101s\u0101n Gate, opening N.E., overlooking the Tigris and the great Bridge-of-Boats which crossed the river. In after times the name of this fourth gate, the B\u0101b Khur\u0101s\u0101n, was transferred to the gate of the city on the eastern bank, through which passed the great high road to Persia (see Section X.).\n\nSuch was the city founded and finished by Al-Man\u1e63\u016br in about A.H. 146 (763), but which, becoming the capital of the Abbasids, very quickly outgrew its earlier limits. Already under Al-Man\u1e63\u016br the markets were removed from his circular (and walled) city, to a suburb built on the southern side of the \u1e62ar\u0101\u1e6d Canal. This market-suburb faced the Ba\u1e63ra Gate, and was given the name of Al-Karkh. Ya\u02bf\u1e33\u016bb\u012b says (p. 246) that it extended two leagues in length by one league across. From Al-Karkh northward, and westward\u2014past the K\u016bfa Gate and along the \u1e62ar\u0101\u1e6d, towards Al-Muh\u0101wwal, a village three miles from Baghd\u0101d\u2014the Caliph divided the ground into fiefs for his nobles, and the lands were soon covered with buildings which extended to beyond the suburb of the Aub\u0101r Gate. Lastly, on the northern side of the original city, up-stream, and beyond the Syrian Gate, lay the \u1e24arb quarter, which was bounded to the north by the line of T\u0101hir\u2019s Trench.\n\nIn the century and a half which had elapsed, counting from the date of the foundation of the city down to the epoch at which Ibn Serapion wrote, Baghd\u0101d had undergone many changes. It had never recovered the destructive effects of the great siege, when Al-Amin had defended himself, to the death, against the troops of his brother Al-Mam\u016bn; and again it had suffered semi-depopulation by the removal of the seat of Government to Samarr\u0101 (see Section I. note 3). The original round-city of Al-Man\u1e63\u016br had long ago been absorbed into the\ngreat capital, which covered ground measuring about five miles across in every direction, and the circular walls must, at an early date, have been levelled. The four gates, however, had remained and had given their names to the first suburbs, which, in time, had been absorbed into the Western town and become one half of the great City of Peace (D\u0101r-as-Sal\u0101m), the Baghd\u0101d of the Caliphs.\n\nThe \u1e62ar\u0101t Canal dates back to Sassanian times. It is a prominent feature in the history of the Muslim conquest (cf. Bil\u0101dhuri, p. 246), and the name was apparently transferred in later times to the other \u1e62ar\u0101t, mentioned above (Section VI. note 6). Kantara-as-\u1e62iniyy\u0101t may mean \"the Porcelain Bridge\" (Sin being the Arab name for China). Possibly, however, the word is of Aramaic origin, signifying \"of the Date-palms,\" for As-Sin, with this sense, is a name common to many places in Babylonia (cf. Z.D.M.G. XXXIX. p. 9, note 4). Y\u0101k\u016bt (III. 378) in the place of As-Siniyy\u0101t, gives As-Sabib\u0101t, probably a clerical error, for the MSS. of Al-Kha\u1e6d\u012bb confirm Ibn Serapion.\n\nThe Patrician's Mills are described by Ya\u1e33\u016bb\u012b (p. 243) and Y\u0101k\u016bt (II. 759). The name of the bridge near these is written by Al-Kha\u1e6d\u012bb (f. 104) Az-Zabd, and Zabad is given in Y\u0101k\u016bt (II. 914) as the name of a place in Western Baghd\u0101d \"mentioned in the Histories.\" Al-Man\u1e63\u016br granted these mills in fief to Al-\u2018Abb\u0101s, his brother, and after him, doubtless the neighbouring Bridge of Al-\u2018Abb\u0101s was called. The Old Bridge, opposite the K\u016bfa Gate, Ya\u1e33\u016bb\u012b (p. 244) states, was one of the first to be built by Al-Man\u1e63\u016br; the New Bridge, opposite the Ba\u1e63ra Gate, Bil\u0101dhuri (p. 295) ascribes to Al-Mahdi.\n\nThe famous Ka\u1e63r-al-Khuld, \"the Palace of Perpetuity,\" on the Tigris bank, Y\u0101k\u016bt (II. 459) states, was built by Al-Man\u1e63\u016br. It was the favourite residence of H\u0101r\u016bn-ar-Rash\u012bd, and apparently fell\nto ruin after the great siege of Baghd\u0101d, during the civil war following the death of that Caliph; for \u1e24\u0101r\u016bn-ar-Rash\u012bd\u2019s son, Al-Amin, had, at the last, entrenched himself with his troops in this palace. It lay immediately below the great Bridge-of-Boats crossing the Tigris to the eastern quarter. On the site of the palace the Buwayhid prince \u2018Aq\u016bd-ad-Dawla, in A.H. 368 (978), built his famous Hospital (Bim\u0101rist\u0101n).\n\nThe Trench of \u1e6c\u0101hir took its name from the founder of the \u1e6c\u0101hirid Dynasty of Khur\u0101s\u0101n, who had been the General of the troops of Al-Mam\u016bn during the civil war. He crushed the power of Al-Amin, and was responsible for his death. The \u1e24arbiyya quarter was named after \u1e24arb-ibn-\u2018Abd-Allah of Balkh, who, Y\u0101k\u016bt (II. 234) states, was a favourite of Al-Man\u1e63\u016br. By the thirteenth century A.D. the \u1e24arbiyya had come to be a separate walled-suburb, with its own markets, lying two miles distant from old Baghd\u0101d. Ibn Hawkal (p. 164) describes the \u1e24arbiyya as lying opposite, on the western bank of the Tigris, to the Shamm\u0101siyya on the eastern side. Ish\u0101k, son of Ibr\u0101h\u012bm the \u1e6c\u0101hirid, near whose D\u0101r (or palace) the Trench flowed out into the Tigris, is, I presume, the member of that family who, according to Mas\u02bf\u016bd\u012b (VII. 381), was Governor of Baghd\u0101d under Al-Mutawakkil, while that Caliph was living at Samarr\u0101. Y\u0101k\u016bt (III. 378) is certainly in error in stating that the Trench of \u1e6c\u0101hir flowed out into the Tigris, \u201cin front of the Gate of Al-Ba\u1e63ra.\u201d He must here have confounded it with the \u1e62ar\u0101t.\n\nUmm Ja\u02bffar (the Mother of Ja\u02bffar) was the surname of the famous Zubayda, cousin and chief wife of \u1e24\u0101r\u016bn-ar-Rash\u012bd, and mother of Al-Amin (see Section V. note 3). The Zubaydiyya Fief (mentioned below) is referred to by Y\u0101k\u016bt (II. 917, IV. 141).\nFrom Al-Muhawwal to the first bridge (the Y\u0101siriyya) on the \u2018\u012as\u0101 Canal, measured one mile, and as the Karkh\u0101y\u0101 is said to have branched off \u201ca short distance\u201d below Al-Mu\u1e25awwal, I presume its head to have been above the Y\u0101siriyya. Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 252) quotes the present account of the Karkh\u0101y\u0101, but adds that by the thirteenth century A.D. all trace of this canal had disappeared. Of the places here mentioned most do not occur again in Y\u0101k\u016bt. The Hospital (Bim\u0101rist\u0101n) is not to be confounded with that built by \u2018\u0100dud-ad-Dawla (see note 2). Ya\u2019\u1e33\u016bb\u012b (p. 244) describes the gate called B\u0101b Mu\u1e25awwal as leading out to the suburb of Humayd, which Y\u0101k\u016bt (II. 750) says was called after one of the nobles of Al-Mans\u016br\u2014Humayd, the son of Al-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6daba, who gave his name to a road mentioned below (see Section XII. note 3). The Suwayka, \u201clittle S\u016bk\u201d or Market of Abu-l-Ward, Y\u0101k\u016bt (III. 201) describes as having been built by a certain judge, in the reign of Al-Mahdi. The same authority (I. 592) states that Zalzal, who dug the Pool called after him, was the great lute-player, brother-in-law of the celebrated musician Ibr\u0101h\u012bm of Mosul, whose music was the delight of H\u0101r\u016bn-ar-Rashid and his court. The gateway called the Arch (T\u0101k) of the \u1e24arr\u0101nian was built by a certain Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, whom Y\u0101k\u016bt (III. 489) calls a freedman of Al-Mans\u016br.\n\nThe two places called Ad-Darr\u0101b\u0101t\u2014which may mean \u201cthe female musicians\u201d\u2014and Al-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6da are mentioned by Al-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6dib (f. 104), who quotes this passage. Khaf\u1e6da, which means \u201ca short sleep, a nap,\u201d is curious as a place-name. Al-\u2018Am\u016bd signifies the \u201cmain-stream\u201d of a river or canal.\n\nNahr-ad-Daj\u0101j, \u201cthe Fowls\u2019 Canal,\u201d is mentioned by Ya\u2019\u1e33\u016bb\u012b (p. 250) and Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 838). The Poulterers had their market here. The Nahr-al-Kil\u0101b, \u201cthe Dogs\u2019 Canal,\u201d took its name from the Dogs\u2019 Fi\u1e6d\u1e6d, adjacent thereto, which Al-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6dib mentions\n(f. 83) as having been so called by Al-Man\u1e63\u016br (and for want of a better designation) by reason of the number of these animals which had congregated there. The Nahr-al-Kallayin, named from the cooks who fried fish and lived on this canal, is mentioned by Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 843): He adds that a village called Warth\u0101l stood on this spot before the building of Baghd\u0101d. He also describes (IV. 841) the Nahr T\u0101b\u0101k, stating (III. 486) that it derived its name from the great \"tiles\" (t\u0101bak) made here, with which it was customary to pave the houses in Baghd\u0101d. Y\u0101k\u016bt adds that this canal was originally called the Nahr B\u0101bak, having been dug by B\u0101bak or Papak, the Sassanian. It apparently flowed out into the Nahr \u2018\u012as\u0101 near the palace called the Ka\u1e63r \u2018\u012as\u0101. Ya\u2018k\u016bb\u012b, on the other hand (p. 250), says that this canal took its name from a certain man called T\u0101bak-ibn-\u1e62amyah. The D\u0101r-al-Battikh, \u201cthe Melon House,\u201d is mentioned by Y\u0101k\u016bt (II. 517), but he gives no details.\n\n[SECTION XII.]\n\nCanals of the \u1e24arbiyya.\u00b9\n\nOf these is a Canal, which is brought from the Dujayl and is called the Nahr Ba\u1e6d\u0101\u1e6diy\u0101.\u00b2 Its point of origin is six leagues below the head of the Dujayl. It passes thence, watering many domains and villages, and goes by the midst of (the district of) Maskin, whence it flows out through the domains, and here is lost.\n\nBut there is brought from the Ba\u1e6d\u0101\u1e6diy\u0101, from a point a little below the Bridge-of-Boats of Ba\u1e6d\u0101\u1e6diy\u0101, a canal which flows on towards Baghd\u0101d, into which it passes, by the conduit of the K\u016braj at the Bridge of the Gate of Al-Anb\u0101r. It enters Baghd\u0101d at this point, passing along the road of the B\u0101b-al-Anb\u0101r, and, traversing the road of Al-Kabeh, there disappears.\n\nNow from the Nahr Ba\u1e6d\u0101\u1e6diy\u0101 aforesaid is brought another canal, its origin being at a point lower down than\nthat of the first canal. It flows towards Baghd\u0101d, and passes (into the city) by a conduit called \u2018Abb\u0101rat-al-K\u016bkh, which crosses (the Trench of T\u0101hir) between the (gates of the) B\u0101b Harb and the B\u0101b-al-Hadid. Passing this, it enters Baghd\u0101d, running down the road of Dujayl to (the Quadrangle of the Persians) Murabba\u2018at-al-Furs. Here there is taken from it a canal called Nahr Dukk\u0101n-al-Ibn\u0101 (of the Shops of the Persian-Arab nobles), which flowing off disappears.\n\nThe main canal passes on from the Quadrangle of the Persians to the Bridge of Abu-l-Jawn. Here there is taken from it a canal to the place of the Scribes for the Orphans, and thence to the (Quadrangle called) Murabba\u2018a Shab\u012bb, and there it falls out into the canal of the road (near the Syrian Gate), as we shall describe below.\n\nThe main canal passes on from the bridge of Abu-l-Jawn to the road of the (palace called) Ka\u1e63r H\u0101n\u012b, thence it passes to the (garden called) Bust\u0101n-al-Kass, and finally it flows out into the canal which passes down the road of the Ka\u1e25\u1e6daba\u2019s.\n\nFrom the Nahr Ba\u1e6d\u0101tiy\u0101 is brought a canal, whose origin is from the (channel called) Kan\u0101t-al-K\u016bkh; and it flows to Baghd\u0101d. It passes by the Conduit, which is a K\u016braj, over the bridge of the B\u0101b Harb, and there enters Baghd\u0101d. Flowing down the middle of the road of the B\u0101b Harb, it comes to the road of (the house called) D\u0101r Ibn Abu-\u2018Awn, and next to the Quadrangle of Abu-l-\u2018Abb\u0101s. Thence it passes to the Quadrangle of Shab\u012bb, where there falls into it the canal (of the Scribes for the Orphans), as we have already mentioned; and from this point it passes to the B\u0101b-ash-Sh\u0101m (the Gate of Syria).\n\nThese, therefore, which we have discussed, are the Canals of (Baghd\u0101d), the City of Peace. Now the canals which are in (the quarter called) Al-Harbiyya are (the kind of water-courses called) Kan\u0101t, and they run underground, but (their courses outside the city) where they begin are (canals and) uncovered, as, please Allah, may He be exalted! thou hast understood.\nThe water of the \u1e24arbiyya Canals had to cross the Khandak, or Trench of T\u0101hir, in order to reach the \u1e24arbiyya quarter; and the conduits generally passed over by the bridges crossing the trench in front of the several gates. A water-conduit, crossing at right angles a lower canal, appears, in Baghd\u0101d, to have been called either K\u016braj or \u2018Abb\u0101ra. K\u016braj is the name which Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 198) gives to one of the canals of the Western quarter, which was brought down from the K\u0101\u1e6d\u016bl, and which, whenever it broke its banks, laid the whole of that part of Baghd\u0101d under water. M. de Goeje says (Histoire des Carmathes, 2nd edition, note 3 to p. 13), that K\u016braj is the Arab form of the Persian K\u016bra \u201ca canal.\u201d The word \u2018Abb\u0101ra, which Ibn Serapion also uses, does not occur in this sense in our Arabic dictionaries; but it is evident from the present and the following passages that \u2018Abb\u0101ra means \u201ca small aqueduct or water-conduit crossing a canal.\u201d In many cases the word K\u016braj of Ibn Serapion\u2019s MS. is replaced in the corresponding passage of Al-Kha\u1e6d\u012bb by the word \u2018Abb\u0101ra\u2014which is a noun formed from the verb \u2018abara, \u201cto cross over,\u201d following the grammatical form of such words as Kall\u0101sa, \u201ca lime-kiln,\u201d and \u1e2aayy\u0101ra, \u201ca bitumen-pit,\u201d (cf. W. Wright\u2019s Grammar, 2nd edition, I. 199).\n\nThe paragraph on the Ba\u1e6d\u0101\u1e6diy\u0101 Canal is given, in a mutilated form, by Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 835), who quotes it at second-hand from Al-Kha\u1e6d\u012bb. Sh\u0101ri\u2018-al-Kabsh, \u201cthe Road of the Ram,\u201d is mentioned by Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 233), who speaks of Al-Kabsh-wa-l-Asad, \u201cthe Ram and the Lion,\u201d as a quarter of Western Baghd\u0101d, in his day long gone to ruin. It was the limit, according to Al-Kha\u1e6d\u012bb (f. 67), of the houses of Baghd\u0101d on the west. Murabba\u2018at-al-Furs, \u201cthe Quadrangle of the Persians,\u201d Y\u0101k\u016bt states (IV. 485) was a fief granted by Al-Man\u1e63\u016br\nto certain men of that nation. The reading *Nahr Dukk\u0101n-al-Ibn\u0101* is from the Paris MSS. of Al-Kha\u1e6d\u012bb. The word *Dukk\u0101n* is used by so early an authority as Bil\u0101dhur\u012b (p. 281) in the usual sense of a \"balcony,\" or \"shop\"; while *Ibn\u0101* is the term applied by the Arabs to the nobles of Persian race who ruled in Arabia (see Mas\u02bf\u016bd\u012b, IV. 188).\n\n3 The Bridge of Abu-l-Jawn is mentioned incidentally by Y\u0101k\u016bt (III. 277). The Quadrangle of Shab\u012bb the same authority states (III. 489) was named after a certain Shab\u012bb-ibn-R\u0101\u1e25; Bil\u0101dhur\u012b (p. 296), however, gives him as Ibn W\u0101j. The Garden of Al-Kass is mentioned by both Bil\u0101dhur\u012b (p. 296) and Ya\u02bfk\u016bb\u012b (p. 247) as being named after a certain freedman of the Caliph Al-Mans\u016br. The road which was called after the family of the Kahtaba, since their houses and fiefs bordered it, is referred to by Ya\u02bfk\u016bb\u012b (p. 246), who speaks also of the Suburb called after Al-\u1e24asan Ibn Kahtaba (see Section XI. note 4).\n\n4 The House of Ibn Abu-\u02bfAwn took its name from the son of Abu-\u02bfAwn, who, according to Y\u0101k\u016bt (II. 750), was a freedman of Al-Mans\u016br, and at one time Governor of Egypt. He was a native of Jurj\u0101n, near the Caspian Sea, and was called \u02bfAbd-al-Malik ibn Zayd or Yaz\u012bd, according to Ya\u02bfk\u016bb\u012b (p. 249). The Quadrangle of Abu-l-\u02bfAbb\u0101s is given in Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 485), and is ascribed to a certain Abu-l-\u02bfAbb\u0101s-al-Fadl-ibn-Sulaym\u0101n of \u1e6c\u016bs, who was one of the nobles of Al-Mans\u016br.\n\n[SECTION XIII.]\n\nAnd now as regards the canals Al-Ba\u1e63ra, and the description of Al-Bat\u012b\u1e25a\u00b9 (the Swamp), and (the estuary of the Tigris called) the Dijla-al-\u02bfAwr\u0101; verily all these I will describe unto thee, and grace comes from Allah!\nDESCRIPTION OF MESOPOTAMIA AND BAGHDAD.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF AL-BAT\u012a\u1e24A\u00b9 (THE SWAMP).\n\nNow the beginning of the Swamp is at Al-Katr. This place is a strait of water growing with reeds. Next to this comes what is called a Hawr; and Hawr is the name for a great sheet of (clear) water wherein no reeds grow.\u00b2 The name of this first Hawr is Bahass\u0101.* Following this comes a strait full of reeds, and then the second Hawr, which has the name of Bakams\u0101. Next comes another strait growing with reeds, and then the third Hawr, the name of which is Ba\u1e63ray\u0101th\u0101. Then another strait with reeds, and next the fourth Hawr, the name of which is Al-Mu\u1e25ammadiyya, on which is the (tower called) Min\u0101ra \u1e24ass\u0101n. This last is the largest of all the Hawrs. Finally there is a last strait with reeds, which extends down to (the channel called) the Nahr Abu-l-Asad.\u00b3 This stream passes by Al-H\u0101la and the village of Al-Kaw\u0101n\u012bn, and it finally falls out into the (Blind Tigris or) Dijlal-al-\u2018Awr\u0101.\n\n\u00b9 The great Swamps formed by the Euphrates and the Tigris are called, in Arabic, Al-Bat\u012b\u1e25a or, in the plural, Al-Bat\u0101yih. Bil\u0101dhuri (p. 292) dates the origin of the Swamps as far back as the reign of the Persian king Kub\u0101dh I., towards the end of the fifth century A.D., when the dykes on the Tigris, having been for many years neglected, the waters poured through a breach below Kaskar and flooded the low-lying lands. During the reign of An\u016bshirw\u0101n the Just, son and successor of Kub\u0101dh, the dykes were partially repaired and the lands brought back under cultivation; but under King Khwaraw Parwiz, the contemporary of Mu\u1e25ammad, and about the year seven or eight after the Flight (A.D. 629), both the Tigris and the Euphrates rose in such flood as had never before been seen, burst their dykes in various places, and laid all the\n\n* Reading uncertain.\nsurrounding country under water. According to the account in Bil\u0101dhuri, King Parwiz himself superintended the repair of the dykes, sparing (he writes) neither men's lives nor money, \"crucifying forty dyke-men, at a certain breach, in one day, and yet was unable to master the water.\" The Swamps, thus formed, became permanent, for, during the succeeding years, when the Muslims were overrunning Mesopotamia and destroying the Persian monarchy, the dykes naturally were left uncared for. \"Then breaches came in all the embankments, and none attended, for the Dikh\u0101ns (the Persian landlords) were powerless to renew the great dykes, and so the Swamps lengthened and widened.\"\n\nIbn Rusta (p. 94) describes the Swamps in his day as occupying a space measuring thirty leagues (about 100 miles) across in every direction. They were covered with reeds, and their waters abounded with fish, which were caught, salted, and exported. In another passage (p. 185) the same author describes how the Tigris below Al-Ka\u1e6dr divides into three branches, through which its waters flowed into the Swamps. These waterways were too shallow to float the river-boats, and the cargoes from them were therefore transferred to skiffs, which were able to navigate the channels through the swamps, and pass out into the open spaces of clear water, the name of which Ibn Rusta writes \"Hawl\" (p. 185). He continues:\u2014\"Now, in among these channels, dry places have been made on platforms formed of reeds, and huts have been built, where shelter may be had from the gnats. In each of these huts five men are stationed as guards.\"\n\nThe names given for the four Hawrs (in Ibn Rusta written Hawl), or sheets of open water, in the Swamps, are not, to my knowledge, mentioned by any other geographer. The first Hawr, called Bah-\u0101\u1e63\u0101, is written in the MS. without diacritical points,\nand the first letter (which I have pointed to read B) may just as likely be read T, Th, N, or Y. Bakams\u0101 and Basray\u0101th\u0101 are written clearly, with points. Al-Mu\u1e25ammadiyya, a name common to many towns, does not occur in other authorities as the name of a place in the Swamps. \u1e24ass\u0101n, the Nabathean, whose tower, or minaret, existed at this place, is referred to by Bil\u0101dhur\u012b (p. 293) and Kud\u0101ma (p. 240) as having been employed by the Governor, Al-\u1e24ajj\u0101j, to drain and reclaim lands in the Swamps, during the days of the Omayyad Caliphs.\n\nThe main channel leading out from the Swamps was the canal called the Nahr of Abu-l-Asad, who is stated by Bil\u0101dhur\u012b (p. 293) to have been a Freedman of the Caliph Al-Man\u1e63\u016br. He was at one time in command of troops at Al-Ba\u1e63ra, and either dug or widened this canal, so as to allow boats to pass along it; for more probably the canal already existed from Persian times, as Y\u0101\u1e33\u016bt remarks (IV. 830).\n\n[SECTION XIV.]\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE DIJLA-AL-\u2018AWR\u0100.\n\nNow, where the (water) flows out from the Nahr Abu-l-Asad, the Dijla-al-\u2018Awr\u0101 (the Blind Tigris) lies in front, going crosswise. The road to Al-Ba\u1e63ra is that on the right hand where the (water) flows out; while to the left is the road leading to \u2018Abdasi and Al-Madh\u0101r. And in this last direction there is no exit or river-mouth, for on the contrary (the water flowing up it) this is the limit reached by the ebb and flow of the tides. When the (water) comes out from (the channel called) the Nahr Abu-l-Asad, and turning leaves the same, the (main-stream) passes near the following places, namely: Ad-Daskara, Al-Maftah, \u2018Abb\u0101d\u0101n, and Sulaym\u0101n\u0101n; and finally it flows out into the sea below \u2018Abb\u0101d\u0101n. We will later on detail to thee the positions of these villages and cities on the two banks of\nthe Blind Tigris, at the time when we describe the Roads and Ways; if it please Allah, be He exalted!\n\n1 I have translated Dijla-al-\u2018Awr\u0101 by \u201cBlind Tigris,\u201d for the word \u2018Awr\u0101, which means in Arabic \u201cblind of one eye,\u201d is applied, as an epithet, to rivers that have become silted up. In the same sense a road is said to be \u201cblind,\u201d along which there is no sign of the way. The corresponding verb, which is used by Ibn Rusta for the \u201csilting up\u201d of the Tigris, has in the dictionaries (cf. those of Lane and Dozy, s.v.) the meaning \u201cto become blind,\u201d and also \u201cto become halt or maimed.\u201d\n\nThe Blind Tigris, called in Persian Bahmanshir (Tanbih, p. 52; and Y\u0101k\u016bt, I. 770), also known as the Fay\u1e0d or \u201cEstuary\u201d of Al-Basra, corresponds exactly (as described by Ibn Serapion) with the present Shatt-al-\u2018Arab, extending from modern Korna downwards as far as \u2018Abb\u0101d\u0101n, for in the tenth century A.D. the Persian Gulf came up north to this line. The distances between the Ba\u1e63ra Canals (given in the next Section) tend to the conclusion that the Nahr Abu-l-Asad was identical with the last reach of the present Euphrates, before its confluence with the Tigris at Korna; while the present Tigris, or rather the last six leagues of its course above Korna, is the channel referred to in this and the next Section as the Nahr-al-Madh\u0101r, which is said to have been dammed up towards \u2018Abd\u0101s\u012b and Al-Madh\u0101r. The exact position of these two cities is uncertain; but they must have been situated on or near what is at present the course of the Tigris immediately above Korna. According to Ibn Rusta (confirmed by Y\u0101k\u016bt, I. 669, line 15), in Sassanian times, and before the bursting of the dykes which led to the formation of the Swamps (see note 1 to Section XIII.), the Tigris of those days followed\nthe same eastern channel which it does at the present time. The account in Ibn Rusta (p. 94) appears to me of sufficient importance to be worth translating: \"Now, as to the Blind Tigris, verily before the days of Isl\u0101m it used to go straight up from Al-Madh\u0101r, where at the present day the channel is stopped; for passing up thence by \u2018Abdas\u012b, which is of the districts of Dasti-Mays\u0101n, the channel came out (from the present Tigris bed) at Al-Khayzur\u0101niyya, above Fam-\u0101s-Silh, in the district of W\u0101sit. From thence you pass up to Al-Mad\u0101in. Now sea-going ships used, of old, to sail in from the land of India, coming up the Tigris of Al-Ba\u1e63ra, and thence could attain to Al-Mad\u0101in, for they would sail up (from the Estuary of Al-Ba\u1e63ra) and come out above Fam-\u0101s-Silh, passing into the Tigris of (the part below where in later times was) Baghd\u0101d, whence they came to Al-Mad\u0101in. But after those (ancient) days the river burst its banks, flowing out over the land in front (and south) of the place where W\u0101sit afterwards stood, and here its waters formed the Swamps, as these are known at the present time.... Now of old there used to be Swamps at a place called J\u016bkh\u0101, lying between Al-Madh\u0101r and \u2018Abdas\u012b, where the waters of the Tigris had collected in the days prior to the shifting of the river-bed into the present (western) course down by W\u0101sit. But when this change of course took place and the water of the Tigris ceased to flow down its old channel, this place became a desert and arid, so that he who now passes through (J\u016bkh\u0101) in the summer time suffers from the full force of the Sim\u016bn wind.\" Al-Khayzur\u0101niyya, above Fam-\u0101s-Silh, where the ships are said to have passed into the reaches of the Tigris, above where the Swamps afterwards formed, is doubtless the same place which Ya\u2018k\u016bb\u012b names (p. 322) Kan\u0101\u0163ir-al-Khayzur\u0101n, \"the Bridges, or Arches of Khayzur\u0101n,\" and which he\nplaces on the eastern bank of the river, between Al-Mub\u0101rik (opposite Nahr S\u0101bus) and Fam-as-\u015eilh.\n\n2 \u2018Abdasi, according to Y\u0101k\u016bt (III. 603), was the Arabi-\ncized name of the Persian Afdasah\u012b, which was one\nof the hamlets of Kaskar, and the name passed to\nthe Arab township which came to occupy the older\nsite.\n\nAl-Madh\u0101r was a city of much importance at the\ndate of the Arab conquest, being the capital of the\nprovince of Mayasan. As already noted, it must have\nstood on or near the ancient, eastern, course of the\nTigris, which was more or less identical with the\nmodern course of the river. In Bil\u0101dhuri (p. 342),\nthe city is described as not far from Dasti-Mayasan.\nAlthough no trace of its ruins can be found on the\nmodern maps, Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 468), in the thirteenth\ncentury A.D., writes as though Al-Madh\u0101r still\nexisted, and states that it lay four days' journey\nfrom Al-Basra, being situated between Al-Basra and\nW\u0101sit. It was celebrated for its beautiful mosque\nand venerated for the tomb of \u2018Abd-Allah, one of\nthe sons of the Caliph \u2018Ali.\n\n3 Of the other towns mentioned in this section, \u2018Abb\u0101d\u0101n\nis the only one of which the exact position is known.\nIt exists at the present day, but lies more than\ntwenty miles inland from the present sea-coast. In\nthe tenth century, Mu\u1e33addasi (p. 118) describes\n\u2018Abb\u0101d\u0101n as a city on the sea-coast, standing on\nthe island formed by the estuaries of the Tigris and\nthe Dujayl (or Kar\u016bn river). He adds: \u201cThere\nis no land opposite to \u2018Abb\u0101d\u0101n, only the open\nsea.\u201d It was counted as twelve leagues march from\nAl-Basra.\n\nTo judge from the native map in the Paris MS.,\nSulaym\u0101n\u0101n lay on the Persian side of this island.\nIbn \u1e24awkal (p. 173) describes the town as lying\n\u201cover against (or opposite) \u2018Abb\u0101d\u0101n,\u201d and Bil\u0101-\ndhuri (p. 364) states that it took its name from a\ncertain Sulaym\u0101n ibn J\u0101bir, surnamed \"the Ascetic.\" Ad-Daskara, meaning \"the flat-land,\" Y\u0101k\u016bt writes (II. 575), is a name common to many places, but the position of this particular As-Daskara is not given. Al-Maftah is mentioned by Ibn Hawkal (p. 171) as situated near the western frontier of the Kh\u016bzist\u0101n Province, on the line between Bay\u0101n and Al-Madh\u0101r. Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 586) refers to it as a village lying between Al-Ba\u1e63ra and W\u0101sit, belonging to the province of Al-Ba\u1e63ra. The native map in the Paris MS. places Al-Maftah opposite the exit of the Nahr Ma'kil, and it must have stood near the great estuary, for in the Tanbih (p. 52) the Blind Tigris is given the name of the \"Tigris of Al-Maftah.\"\n\n[SECTION XV.]\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE CANALS OF AL-BA\u1e62RA.\n\nNow Al-Ba\u1e63ra lies near (the estuary called) the Fay\u1e0d of (Al-Ba\u1e63ra), and into this estuary its canals empty themselves. Further, the ebb and flow of the tide comes up to the utmost limit of these canals, and flows back therefrom.\n\nThe first canal which branches from the (estuary), after you come out from the Nahr Abu-l-Asad, is that which lies on the right hand, and it extends as far as Al-Ba\u1e63ra. It is called the Nahr-al-Mar\u0101h, and its beginning is two leagues from the exit of the Nahr Abu-l-Asad.\n\nThe second canal is that called the Nahr-ad-Dayr; and it begins three leagues from the Nahr-al-Mar\u0101h.\n\nThe third canal is the one called Bith\u1e33 Sh\u012br\u012bn; and it begins six leagues below the Canal of Ad-Dayr.\n\nThe fourth canal is that called the Nahr Ma'kil, and between it and the Bith\u1e33 Sh\u012br\u012bn is a distance of two leagues.\n\nThe fifth canal is that called the Nahr-al-Ubulla; and Al-Ubulla is at its head. Between this and the Nahr Ma'kil is a distance of four leagues.\n\n* MS. reads Nahr-al-Ubulla, in error.\nThe sixth canal is called Al-Yah\u016bd\u012b; and between it and Al-Ubulla is four leagues.\n\nThe seventh canal is that called the Nahr Abu-l-Khas\u012bb, and it lies a league below the canal of Al-Yah\u016bd\u012b.\n\nThe eighth canal is that called the Nahr-al-Am\u012br; and it flows at a league below the Nahr Abu-l-Khas\u012bb.\n\nThe ninth canal is called the Nahr-al-\u1e32andil, and it is two leagues below the Nahr-al-Am\u012br.\n\nThese nine canals all flow out into (the estuary called) the Fay\u1e0d of Al-Ba\u1e63ra. They are each some four leagues in the length, but some are more, some less. Now this estuary has its mouth by the Dijla-al-\u2018Awr\u0101 (the Blind Tigris) at \u2018Abb\u0101d\u0101n, at the time of the ebb, and it forms a considerable body of water. The town of \u2018Abb\u0101d\u0101n lies on the sea-shore, and the sea comes close up to it. And in regard to all these nine canals, there is none but from it have been taken numerous smaller canals, which water the adjacent domains.\n\nThese, therefore, are the celebrated and mighty canals of Al-Ba\u1e63ra, which flow out by the western bank of the Dijla-al-\u2018Awr\u0101, and there remain to mention those of the eastern side, which next I will describe to thee, if it please All\u0101h, be He exalted!\n\n---\n\n1 Al-Ba\u1e63ra, the great commercial port of Baghd\u0101d and Mesopotamia, lay on the Arabian side of the Estuary of Al-Ba\u1e63ra, in other words the Blind Tigris, and was about twelve miles, as the crow flies, from its bank. Two great canals\u2014the Nahr Ma'kil on the north-east, and the Nahr-al-Ubulla on the south-east\u2014brought the ships up from the estuary to the quays of the town, which stood at the junction of these two canals. Mukaddasi (p. 117) describes Al-Ba\u1e63ra as having its greatest length along this junction-canal, with houses extending back to the desert border behind, where a single gate opened to the plain. In its width, from the canal bank to this gate, the city measured three miles across. The\nmodern village of Zubayr now occupies the site of old Ba\u1e63ra, for the present town named Ba\u1e63ra stands on the estuary of the Shatt-al-\u2018Arab, and is probably identical in situation with the ancient Al-Ubulla.\n\nOf the nine canals lying on the western or Arabian side of the Tigris estuary, the highest up, called generally the Nahr-al-Mar\u0101h or \u201cthe Woman\u2019s Canal,\u201d appears to be identical with a Nahr Murra, which, according to Bil\u0101dhuri (p. 360), was dug by a certain Murra, the Freedman of one of the sons of the Caliph Abu Bakr. In explanation of the name Al-Mar\u0101h, another tradition given by Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 844) states that the \u201cwoman\u201d after whom the canal was named was a certain Persian princess with whom Kh\u0101lid, General of the Muslim army, made a treaty of peace. The Nahr-ad-Dayr took its name from a Dayr or \u201cCloister\u201d which stood at the mouth of this canal; and a village of that name still exists at the spot indicated. According to Y\u0101k\u016bt (II. 660, IV. 839), a monastery called Dayr-ad-Dihd\u0101r had stood here from the days before Isl\u0101m. Many monks lived in it, and the place was held in high honour by the Christians. The town was noted for the excellent porcelain dishes, which were manufactured here, and exported for sale to Al-Ba\u1e63ra. According to Bil\u0101dhuri (p. 367), the Nahr Bith\u1e33 Sh\u012br\u012bn takes its name from Sh\u012br\u012bn, the beautiful wife of King Khusraw Parwiz. Bith\u1e33 means a \u201ccutting\u201d in the dyke, through which water flows.\n\nThe fourth canal, the Nahr Ma\u1e33il, is, as before stated, the chief waterway from the north by which ships reached Al-Ba\u1e63ra. It was called after Ma\u1e33il-ibn-Yas\u0101r, a companion of the Prophet, who dug this canal during the reign of \u2018Omar (Y\u0101k\u016bt, IV. 845). The Persian pilgrim, N\u0101\u1e63ir-i-Khusraw (p. 85), who visited Al-Ba\u1e63ra in A.H. 443 (1051), describes the Nahr Ma\u1e33il and the Nahr-al-Ubulla as being each\nfour leagues in length. Between the two lay a tract of land forming a great island, oblong in shape, for the ends were each but a league across. One short side of the oblong lay on the Tigris Estuary going from Al-Ubulla up to the mouth of the Ma'kil Canal, and the parallel short side was the waterway, joining the ends of the two canals already named, and on the desert-side of which stood the city of Al-Ba\u1e63ra. These measurements of N\u0101\u1e63ir-i-Khusraw agree very exactly with what is found on the modern maps, for a place called Ma'kil still exists about one league north of Al-Ubulla (which is the modern town of Basra), on the Shatt-al-\u2018Arab. The distance separating these two canals, given at \"four leagues\" by Ibn Serapion, is therefore probably an overstatement, and we should read \"one league,\" as reported in the diary of the Persian pilgrim. Al-Ubulla took its name from an ancient town which the Greeks called Apologos. It stood at the end of the Nahr-al-Ubulla, the waterway by which ships left Al-Ba\u1e63ra when setting sail for the Indian seas. Al-Ubulla, lying at the mouth of this canal on its northern bank, had the great Estuary of the Tigris to the eastward. Facing Al-Ubulla, on the southern bank of the canal mouth, was the hamlet called Shikk \u2018Othm\u0101n, Shikk meaning \"a cutting,\" or \"breach in a dyke.\" Opposite Al-Ubulla, across the great Estuary of the Tigris, here about a league wide, lay the town of \u2018Aaskar Abu-Jaffar, whence, according to Mukaddasi (pp. 118 and 135), the caravans set out for Al-Ahw\u0101z.\n\nOf the four remaining canals on the western side, the Nahr-al-Yah\u016bd\u012b, the \"Jew's Canal,\" appears to have left no trace of its name on the modern maps, and I can find no notice of the origin of the name. The Nahr Abu-l-Khas\u012bb is stated by Bil\u0101dhur\u012b (p. 362) to have taken its name from Abu-l-Khas\u012bb Marz\u016bk, a freedman of the Caliph Al-Mans\u016br, who\ngranted him the lands here in fief. The name is still found on the present map. The Nahr-al-Am\u012br, according to Bil\u0101dh\u016br\u012b (p. 362), was called originally the Nahr Am\u012br-al-Mumin\u012bn, \u201cthe Canal of the Commander of the Faithful,\u201d to wit the Caliph Al-Mans\u016br, who caused it to be dug, and granted its lands in fief to his son Ja\u02bffar. The last canal is the Nahr-al-Kandil, which Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 843) pronounces Kindal, and Abu-l-Fid\u0101 (p. 57) Kundul. The origin of the name appears to be unknown. It is worth noting that Abu-l-Fid\u0101 (pp. 56 and 57) has copied this Section XV. of Ibn Serapion, almost verbatim, into his Geography.\n\n[SECTION XVI.]\n\nCanals to the West of the Basra Estuary.\n\nOf these, on coming forth from the Nahr Abu-l-Asad, the first is a canal called the Nahr-al-Madh\u0101r.* From it are taken many minor canals, but at the end of the canal is a dam. Its length is six leagues.\u2020\n\nThe second canal is that called the Nahr-ar-Rayy\u0101n; and it is situated thirteen leagues from [Al-Madh\u0101r].\u2021 From it are taken many minor canals, and it was originally one of the highways to Al-Ahw\u0101z, but it is now dammed. Its length is six leagues.\n\nThe third canal is that called the Nahr Bay\u0101n,\u00a7 and this at the present time is the highway to Al-Ahw\u0101z. From the head of this canal you pass to \u1e24isn Mahdi,\u2016 and thence to Fam Dahast\u0101n, which is on the (Estuary from the) sea. Thence to S\u016bk Bahr,\u00b6 from which you pass along in the Nahr-as-Sidra, and from whence (you descend) to the sea. From S\u016bk Bahr to (the canal called) Al-Masruk\u0101n is the river of Al-Ahw\u0101z, which is but a little way, going across, and thence you travel to the cities of Al-Ahw\u0101z.**\n\n* MS. Al-Min\u0101r, in error.\n\u2020 The MS. reads Al-Mub\u0101rik, probably a mistake.\nNow the canal of Al-Masruk\u0101n we will describe later on,* if it please Allah Almighty.\n\n1 The channel leading up to Al-Madh\u0101r has been already discussed (see Notes 1 and 2 to Section XIV.). The second canal, the Nahr-ar-Rayy\u0101n, appears to have started from a place marked Riy\u0101n on Kiepert\u2019s map. Ar-Rayy\u0101n is mentioned by Ibn Khurd\u0101dbih (p. 12) as one of the three districts of Kaskar. Other canals of this name occur in the works of Bil\u0101dhur\u012b and Y\u0101k\u016bt, but not this Nahr-ar-Rayy\u0101n. For \u201cAl-Mub\u0101rik\u201d in the MS. I have substituted \u201cAl-Madh\u0101r,\u201d for the distance given agrees. However, Y\u0101k\u016bt (IV. 408) mentions Al-Mub\u0101rik as one of the canals of Al-Ba\u1e63ra, which was dug by Khalid-al-Kasri, governor of the Two \u2018Ir\u0101ks under the Omayyad Caliph Hish\u0101m; but the position of the canal is not given by Y\u0101k\u016bt.\n\n2 The Nahr Bay\u0101n, called after the town of that name\u2014which, according to Istakhri (p. 95) and Y\u0101k\u016bt (I. 773), stood on the eastern side of the Tigris Estuary, five leagues below Al-Ubulla\u2014raises a question of some interest. A reference to the map shows that the Bay\u0101n Canal occupies the position of the Haffar Channel, by which, at the present day, the waters of the K\u0101r\u016bn River are for the most part discharged into the Shatt-al-\u2018Arab. The modern Mohammerah, which stands at the western end of this channel, must very nearly be identical in site with the older town of Bay\u0101n. A passage in Mukaddasi, who wrote about three-quarters of a century later than Ibn Serapion, assigns the digging of this important channel to his contemporary, the Buwayhid Prince \u2018Adud-ad-Dawla, who reigned from A.H. 338 to 372 (949\u2013982). The canal, however, must have existed before his time, and even before the date of\n\n* See next section.\nIbn Serapion, for it is referred to by Kud\u0101ma (p. 194), who wrote in A.H. 266 (880), under the name of the Nahr-al-Jadid, \"the New Canal.\" Doubtless under the orders of 'A\u1e0d\u016bd-ad-Dawla it was sufficiently widened to permit the passage of sea-going ships; and this is what is referred to in the following passage, which I translate from Mu\u1e33addasi (p. 419):\n\n\"From \u1e24i\u1e63n Mahdi to the beginning of the 'A\u1e0d\u016bd\u012b Canal is a day's journey, and thence you reach the Tigris. You may also ride from \u1e24i\u1e63n Mahdi to Bay\u0101n in one day's march, across a Sabkha (or Salt-Marsh). Now the River Dujayl of Al-Ahw\u0101z, and the Tigris, each of them forms a broad estuary (Fayd) which opens out to the China Sea (or Persian Gulf), and between these two estuaries lies the Salt-Marsh above-mentioned. In former times people, travelling by boat, were forced to go down by the Estuary of the Dujayl out to the sea, and then turning round sail back again and enter the Tigris Estuary, and thus from the sea reach Al-Ubulla. But in doing this they encountered both danger and fatigue, and hence it was that 'A\u1e0d\u016bd-ad-Dawla opened the Great Canal which leads from the upper part of the Dujayl Estuary to the Tigris Estuary. This canal is four leagues long, and the waterway from Al-Ahw\u0101z to Al-Ubulla is at the present time along the same.\"\n\n\u1e24i\u1e63n Mahdi, \"Mahdi's Fortress,\" lay at the head of the ancient estuary of the Dujayl or River of Al-Ahw\u0101z, which is the modern K\u0101r\u016bn. Ibn Hawkal (p. 172) writes: \"The rivers of Kh\u016bzist\u0101n, which flow down from Al-Ahw\u0101z, from Ad-Dawrak, from Tustar, and from other quarters adjacent to these, all come together at \u1e24i\u1e63n Mahdi and form an estuary, where the waters are so abundant and copious as to be near a league across, and thence they flow down to the sea.\" \u1e24i\u1e63n Mahdi apparently corresponds with the site of no modern town. It lay one day's march\nabove the place where the Bay\u0101n Channel flowed off to the Tigris Estuary. According to Kud\u0101ma\u2019s distances (p. 194), this fortress was twenty leagues distant from Al-Ahw\u0101z; but I have no authority for determining whether \u1e24i\u1e63n Mahd\u012b lay on the western or on the eastern bank of the estuary of the Dujayl, and I have only marked it on the western side because it is more generally mentioned in connection with the towns of Al-\u2018Ir\u0101\u1e33.\n\nFam Dahast\u0101n is apparently mentioned by no other Arab geographer, and it may be a false reading of the MS. If, however, the reading Dahast\u0101n be correct, it would possibly be the name of the canal, whose head (Fam) was below Al-Ahw\u0101z, and which, after serving to carry off some of the waters of the Dujayl for irrigation purposes, finally ran out into the Persian Gulf. Y\u0101k\u016bt (I. 411) quotes the account of a geographer called Ibn-al-Muhalhal, who died in A.H. 330 (942), and this author mentions a W\u0101d\u012b (river or canal) as branching from the Dujayl below Al-Ahw\u0101z, and flowing down past Al-B\u0101siy\u0101n, a town that lay half-way between Ad-Dawra\u1e33 and \u1e24i\u1e63n Mahd\u012b.\n\nS\u016bk Bahr is given by Y\u0101k\u016bt (III. 193) as the name of a place in the province of Al-Ahw\u0101z, where certain Custom-houses had stood, previous to the date when the Waz\u012br \u2018Ali-ibn-al-Jarra\u1e25 was in office for the first time. This \u2018Ali, who died in A.H. 334 (946) was several times Waz\u012br under the Caliph al-Muk-tadir. He was celebrated for his righteousness and piety, and had abolished these barriers as unlawful. The position of the place is not indicated by Y\u0101k\u016bt, but it probably lay on the River Dujayl. The word Bahr, in this and the following paragraphs of the text, doubtless refers to the great Estuary of the Dujayl and not the actual open sea, for Bahr in Arabic, though signifying literally \u201cthe sea,\u201d is also used for any great river, or estuary.\nThe Nahr-as-Sidra, \"The River of the Lotus,\" is apparently the name given to that part of the Dujayl which lies immediately below Al-Ahw\u0101z.\n\nS\u016bk-al-Ahw\u0101z, \"The Market of the H\u016bz\" (for Ahw\u0101z is the Arabic plural of this latter name, which, with kh, the stronger aspirate, is preserved in the name of the province), is the capital of Kh\u016bzist\u0101n, the Land of the Kh\u016bz or H\u016bz. The town still exists. Mukaddasi (p. 411) describes it as lying for the most part on the eastern bank of the Dujayl, in which quarter the Markets and the Great Mosque were found. This eastern quarter was connected by a long bridge\u2014built of brick arches, called the Kan\u1e6dara Hinduw\u0101n\u2014with an island in the river Dujayl, which was also covered with the houses of the city. On the further, or western side of this island, lay the mainstream of the Dujayl, whose waters, at a distance of a bow-shot below the city, poured over a great Sh\u0101dhurw\u0101n, or weir, built of rocks, which served to dam back the stream for irrigation purposes. The remains of this weir still exist, crossing the K\u0101r\u016bn river.\n\n[SECTION XVII.]\n\nDescription of the River Dujayl of Al-Ahw\u0101z.\u00b9\n\nIts source is in the mountains of the country of I\u1e63fah\u0101n, and passing by the cities of Al-Ahw\u0101z, it flows out into the Eastern Sea (or Persian Gulf). Into the (Dujayl) flows the River of Junday S\u0101b\u016br, across which is the Roman Bridge. (Its source is also in) the neighbourhood of I\u1e63fah\u0101n, and it flows into the Dujayl of Al-Ahw\u0101z.\n\nFrom the Dujayl of Al-Ahw\u0101z is brought a canal called Al-Masru\u1e33\u0101n.\u00b2 Its point of origin is above (the weir\n\n\u00b9 This is the paragraph referred to in the last line of Section XVI. It is copied from folio 47a. of the MS.\ncalled) Ash-Sh\u0101dhurw\u0101n, and it flows out into the Eastern Sea (or Persian Gulf).\n\n1 The Dujayl of Al-Ahw\u0101z is, as already noted, the modern K\u0101r\u016bn. The River of Junday S\u0101b\u016br is what is now known as the \u0100b-i-D\u012bz. The bridge called by Ibn Serapion Kan\u1e6dara-ar-R\u016bm (of the Romans or Greeks), Ibn Rusta (p. 90) calls Kan\u1e6dara-ar-R\u016bdh, \"the Bridge of the River,\" and in Ibn Khurd\u0101dbih (p. 176) it is given as Kan\u1e6dara-az-Z\u0101b. This is, doubtless, the great bridge at Dizful.\n\n2 The canal called Al-Masruk\u0101n (or Al-Mashruk\u0101n, as Ibn Hawkal and most other authorities spell the name) is the artificial channel, apparently that now known as the \u0100b-i-Gerger, which was led off to the eastward from the Dujayl, through a cutting in the rocks, above the great Weir at Shustar or Tustar. Ibn Khurd\u0101dbih (p. 176), following our author, says that the waters of the Masruk\u0101n flowed out \"into the sea,\" but the tidal Estuary of the Dujayl is, doubtless, to be understood, here as elsewhere, under the word Bahr (sea), the term used. The course of the various streams of Kh\u016bzist\u0101n in the tenth century A.D. will be best understood by the following passage, which is translated from Ibn Hawkal (p. 172): premising that the town of \u2018Askar Mukram probably occupied the site of the modern Band-i-K\u012br, and that the River of Tustar, otherwise the Dujayl, flowed in those days by a more westerly course than it does at the present time, Ibn Hawkal writes: \"The largest of the rivers of Kh\u016bzist\u0101n is that of Tustar, and this is the river across which, at the gate of Tustar, King S\u0101b\u016br built a Sh\u0101dhurw\u0101n (or weir), in order to raise\nthe water to the level of the city-lands, for Tustar lies on an elevation, very similar to the heights adjacent in the country near by. Then this river flows on, passing at the further side of 'Askar Mukram, and thence goes down to Al-Ahw\u0101z, where it comes, by the Nahr-as-Sidra, to \u1e24i\u1e63n Mahdi, and thence it flows down to the sea. The Nahr-al-Mashruk\u0101n runs from the neighbourhood of Tustar till it reaches 'Askar Mukram, which town it divides into two halves. Further on it attains Al-Ahw\u0101z, but its end is here, and it does not pass beyond the capital. When the stream has come to 'Askar Mukram it is crossed by a great bridge of about twenty boats, and in these parts large boats can navigate its waters. And I myself (Ibn Hawkal) have travelled by it from 'Askar Mukram to Al-Ahw\u0101z, a distance of ten leagues. For the first six leagues we voyaged by boat, but afterwards we got out and rode along the course of the stream, for the remainder of the way from this point to Al-Ahw\u0101z was a dry road in the river-bed. The reason of this was that, being then at the end of the month, the moon was waning, and the flood-water in this canal is dependent on the ebb and flow of the tide, and the tide reaches both its lowest ebb and its highest flow in connection with the waxing of the moon.\"\n\n[SECTION XVIII.]\n\nThese, therefore, are the great and celebrated canals of (the district of) Al-Ba\u1e63ra; and having now accomplished the detail of the same, it will behove thee to work out the streams which fall into the rivers of the Greek country, and those of the city of Malatya, in order that thou mayest thus know all the affluents that flow into these two noble and mighty rivers (the Euphrates and Tigris), and that\nnone of them remain over to thee unexamined, if it please Allah Almighty.*\n\nOf these, then, is the Nahr Arsan\u0101s. Into this flows a stream called the Nahr-adh-Dh\u012bb (the Wolf River). Its source is in a mountain in the neighbourhood of K\u0101likal\u0101. It turns and passes by many fortresses, and falls into the Arsan\u0101s a short distance above Shamsh\u0101t.\n\nThere also falls into the Arsan\u0101s a river called Nehr-as-Salk\u012bt. It flows forth from the mountains called Jabal Mar\u016br (or Maz\u016br), and passing by many fortresses it falls into the Arsan\u0101s, one mile below the city of Shamsh\u0101t, near a mountain that is over the city, and which closes it in.\n\nAnother of these is the Nahr Abrik. Into this river there falls a stream called the Nahr Zamra. It flows out of the mountains of Jabal Mar\u016br a little way above where the Nahr Lukiya takes its rise; and it falls into the Nahr Abrik a little way below the Castle (Al-Kal'a).\n\nAnother of these is the Nahr Jarjariya. Into this there flows a stream called the Nahr Ghawth; its source is in the mountains of the Abrik country, and it falls into the Nahr Jarjariya in the midst of a meadow in that country.\n\nThe Nahr Kub\u0101kib also has affluents; for there flows into it a stream called the Nahr Karak\u012bs. This rises in the provinces of the Greek country, and flows near to the gate of Zibatra, and at length falls into the Kub\u0101kib.\n\nThere also flows into (the River Kub\u0101kib) a stream called the Nahr-az-Zarn\u016bk. Its source is in a mountain lying between Malatya and Hisn Mans\u016br. It flows into the Kub\u0101kib below the mouth of the Nahr Karak\u012bs.\n\nFrom the Nahr-az-Zarn\u016bk is taken a canal called the Nahr Malatya. Passing on it irrigates the domains of Malatya, and falls into the Kub\u0101kib at a point below the mouth of the Nahr-az-Zarn\u016bk.\n\nFrom this Nahr Malatya is taken a canal, from which come the water-channels of the Nahr Malatya. These irrigate the gardens that lie along the same, and after\n\n* What follows is almost a repetition of Section IV., and such points as offer any novelty have already been discussed in the Notes to that Section.\npassing through the suburb of Malatya, they ramify throughout the city. Then, after leaving the city, they flow out into the river Kub\u0101kib, near to, but below, the Bridge of Kub\u0101kib.\n\nSo, therefore\u2014through the aid and power of Allah\u2014this description of the rivers of Al-'Ir\u0101k, to wit, the Tigris and the Euphrates, with the streams that flow into them and the canals that are derived from them, is now concluded.\n\nContents: Section I., The Tigris, p. 33.\u2014Section II., The Euphrates, p. 46.\u2014Section III., Affluents of the Euphrates, p. 53.\u2014Section IV., Streams flowing into these Affluents, p. 62.\u2014Section V., Canals between the Euphrates and Tigris, p. 68.\u2014Section VI., Canals of the Lower Euphrates, p. 255.\u2014Section VII., Affluents of the Tigris, p. 261.\u2014Section VIII., Canals of the Tigris, p. 265.\u2014Section IX., The same continued, p. 270.\u2014Section X., Canals of Eastern Baghdad, p. 277.\u2014Section XI., Canals of Western Baghdad, p. 285.\u2014Section XII., Canals of the \u1e24arbiyya Quarter, p. 293.\u2014Section XIII., The Great Swamp, p. 296.\u2014Section XIV., The Blind Tigris, p. 299.\u2014Section XV., Canals of Al-Ba\u1e63ra, p. 303.\u2014Section XVI., Canals to the West of Al-Ba\u1e63ra, p. 307.\u2014Section XVII., The River Dujayl, p. 311.\u2014Section XVIII., Affluents of the Euphrates, p. 313.\nART. IX.\u2014On the Origin and Earlier History of the Chinese Coinage. By L. C. Hopkins, M.R.A.S.\n\nThe origin and earlier history of the Chinese coinage have been discussed in several European works, of which the most important are, in order of date, Dr. W. Vissering's \"On Chinese Currency,\" Leiden, 1877; Professor S. M. Georgievsky's \"Drevneishia monet Kitaichev\" (The Ancient Chinese Coins), 1889; and M. Terrien de Lacouperie's \"Catalogue of Chinese Coins,\" printed by order of the Trustees of the British Museum, 1892.\n\nThe second of these productions, being in Russian, is to my great regret inaccessible to me. Curiously enough, the other two are both in English, though neither of their authors claims that nationality.\n\nIn many ways Vissering's volume is a most meritorious achievement. The scheme of the book is excellent; the author has obviously spared neither time nor labour nor zeal on his task, and wherever he gives a full translation, he adds the Chinese text. Here unfortunately is the weak point of the work. The translations are so very defective as in many places to be useless. I do not know whether I am right in my conjecture, but this part of Vissering's undertaking gives me the impression that his translations of a text which offers numerous difficulties, have been made with the help of dictionaries only, and without the immense, the indispensable advantage of references to and consultations with living native scholars. I do not believe there exists a single Occidental student who has acquired Chinese in China or amongst Chinese, that will dispute the opinion of Dr. Bretschneider, quoted and confirmed by Professor G. Schlegel in the T'oung Pao, vol. i. p. 119, in\nthese words\u2014\"The mistakes he [Dr. Hoffmann] made were principally due to the insufficiency of our Chinese dictionaries, and to his never having been in China. We quite agree, in this respect, with Dr. Bretschneider, when he says: 'that it is impossible to make correct translations from Chinese in Europe [the italics are not mine] without the assistance of a good native scholar; excepting, of course, those sinologues who have studied the language in China, and who have studied it for a long time.'\"\n\nHence every allowance ought to be made for Vissering's shortcomings in this respect, if, as seems to have been the case, he had learnt Chinese in Europe only.\n\nM. Lacouperie has not dealt, I regret to point out, fairly by his predecessor in these numismatic studies. The only reference to Vissering's work that is to be found in the whole of the \"Catalogue\" is in a single footnote on p. lxviii. of the Introduction, and is to this effect: \"It [viz. Ma Tuan-lin's Section on Currency] forms . . . the bulk of Dr. W. Vissering, On Chinese Currency, Coin and Paper Money, Leiden, 1877.\" Yet M. Lacouperie is abundantly indebted to the Dutch author. Over and over again he makes use of Vissering's work, sometimes without alteration, oftener with slight verbal changes, omissions, or additions, frequently with somewhat more material modifications, but always without acknowledgment. Between pages 338 and 431 of the \"Catalogue,\" I have marked no less than forty-four passages thus silently adopted.\n\nWith regard to the \"Catalogue of Chinese Coins\" itself, I wish to be perfectly frank. Having had occasion to examine it closely\u2014and I doubt if any other person has spent so much time over this book as I have\u2014I came to certain conclusions which led to the preparation of the present paper. I found, as I believed, many demonstrable errors, many mere conjectures of the author's stated as though they were well ascertained and acknowledged facts, and a number of difficult points which merited much more thorough investigation than they had yet received. In view, therefore, of the authoritative character of a volume issued\nby the Trustees of the British Museum, I felt impelled to endeavour to the best of my powers to present the available data of this obscure and intricate subject, as they emerge after what has been, I know, a long and careful, and, I hope, an unbiased examination of all the materials accessible to me which throw light on the first stages of the Chinese monetary system.\n\nBefore plunging into the rather tangled details which it has been necessary to gather together and arrange, it may be as well to indicate concisely what appears to be shown, and what, though not demonstrable, is suggested, by the evidence available for forming conclusions.\n\nThe actual origin of the earliest form of their metallic money is clearly unknown to the Chinese. But tradition, already embodied in the work known as Kuan Tz\u016d, and afterwards repeated in the Lu Shih of Lo Pi, attributes to the founders of the Hsia and Shang dynasties the casting of metal from mountains which are named into what may have been merely ingots, with the object of relieving distress in times of flood and drought.\n\nBut Kuan Tz\u016d gives us, and in considerable detail, particulars of the use of \"treasure\" in the administration of his agrarian polity by a still earlier ruler, the legendary Emperor Shun. Chinese numismatists, relying upon these passages in Kuan Tz\u016d, believe that a few of these \"treasures\" have come down to historical times, and that they are represented by the archaic inscribed pieces of peculiar shape discussed below under the heading of Pi ch'eng ma. This attribution is by no means free from doubt, and is partially founded on a reading of the legends on the pieces which is itself most questionable.\n\nIt would appear probable that at a later epoch, say about the beginning of the Chou dynasty, two distinct types of metal money, with corresponding names, possibly characterizing different regions or political centres, were already in existence\u2014the knife-money and the wedge-handled pu. The former seems to have been mainly current in what is now the province of Shantung. Whether a third type, the\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1895.\ncircular coin pierced in the centre, may not also have been in use in some parts of the country seems impossible to decide. The History of the Earlier Han dynasty is the ultimate source of our knowledge of the next stage.\n\nAccording to this work, a Minister, not himself a native of the Chou State, but employed by the founder of that dynasty, instituted (which may mean either invented, or simply introduced), for his master's benefit, a \"system of currency.\" This system included squares of gold of a fixed weight, lengths of silk and hempen cloth of definite dimensions, and, lastly, round copper or bronze coins having a central square hole, which the historian speaks of as ch'ien, a name the true origin of which is most obscure, but which remains their designation to this day. It is a matter of question whether the term ch'ien was, in the first instance, applied to this round copper coin, or whether it was preceded by the word ch'\u00fcan, and, if either of these names was so applied, whether other terms may not have been employed besides. Further, we do not really know whether these coins were inscribed or not.\n\nThe next point is reached in the statement recorded in the same history that a larger coin than was then current was cast by the Chou sovereign Ching, and was inscribed with the words pao huo, \"valuable exchange.\" Specimens of archaic appearance are preserved which have this legend on them, as well as others bearing the numbers \"four\" and \"six\" before the character for \"exchange.\"\n\nIt would be unsafe to infer that there had been no change whatever in the currency of the Chou realm in the interval of nearly six hundred years that had elapsed between the reign of Ching and the establishment of the dynasty. Still less should we be justified in assuming that in the various other States, one uniform and continuous type had prevailed during this considerable period. Probably some of the round coins which have come down to us, and the date and locality of whose issue cannot be certainly determined, may reach as far back. Many of them have round instead of square central holes.\nAfter the consolidation of the Empire under the Ts'in dynasty, the History of the Earlier Han tells us, two forms of money alone were in use\u2014gold, and copper cash inscribed pan liang, \"half ounce\"\u2014the other varieties of currency, such as pearls, jade, tortoise-shell, shells, silver, and tin being discarded.\n\nSuch is a brief outline of the main facts collected in the entries that follow below, bearing on the origin and the earliest stages of money in the group of States and principalities which have since become the Chinese Empire.\n\nThere are two extracts from native works which must be considered somewhat fully, and may conveniently stand here at the head of the separate entries dealing with the numismatic terminology.\n\nThe first is a famous passage from the Section on Food and Commerce, of the History of the Earlier Han dynasty. The second is taken from the Section on Money in the great Imperial Encyclop\u00e6dia, the T'u Shu Chi Ch'\u00eang.\n\nBrief as the Ch'ien Han Shu passage is, and simple as it looks, it contains two or three short clauses which were very perplexing to me at first, but having had the great advantage of consulting both Dr. Legge and Mr. Watters, and quite recently, H. E. Shao, the present Governor of Formosa, I believe the meaning to be substantially as here given. The text runs:\n\n\"\u65e0\u8d27\u91d1\u94b1\u5e03\u5e1b\u4e4b\u7528\u590f\u6bb7\u4ee5\u524d\u5176\u8be6\u9761\u8bb0\u4e91\u592a\u516c\u4e3a\u5468\u7acb\u4e5d\u5e9c\u56fe\u6cd5\u9ec4\u91d1\u65b9\u5bf8\u800c\u91cd\u4e00\u65a4\u94b1\u56fe\u51fd\u65b9\u8f7b\u91cd\u4ee5\u94e2\u5e03\u5e1b\u5e7f\u4e8c\u5c3a\u4e8c\u5bf8\u4e3a\u5e45\u957f\u56db\u4e08\u4e3a\u5339\u6545\u8d27\u5b9d\u4e8e\u91d1\u5229\u4e8e\u5200\u6d41\u4e8e\u6cc9\u5e03\u4e8e\u5e1b\u675f\u4e8e\u5e1b\u592a\u516c\u9000\u53c8\u884c\u4e4b\u4e8e\u9f50\"\n\n\"No particulars are recorded concerning media of exchange, gold and copper money, hempen cloths and silks, before the time of the dynasties of Hsia and Yin. T'ai Kung instituted the currency of the Nine Treasuries, on behalf of the Chou: gold, in pieces of an inch square,\"\nweighing one chin; copper coins, circular with a central square, their weight reckoned in shu; hempen cloths and silks, in breadths of two feet two inches, and in length four chang [40 feet of the period]. Hence, with regard to commodities, high value [was reflected] in the gold, utility in the knives, their onward flow in the [copper] currency, their diffusion in the cloths, and their compactness in the silks. After the retirement of T'ai Kung [from Chou] the system was again applied in Ta'i.\"\n\nThe first point to which I would draw attention is that the expression yuan fa, which I translate 'currency,' seems, on the face of the text, to be applied to all three varieties mentioned, the gold, the cloths and silks, and the copper coins. But Chinese writers on the subject, so far as I have seen, restrict the term to the last of the three.\n\nIt will also be remarked that the passage really consists of a statement of fact, for which the author probably had documentary warrant extant in his time, and of a highly symbolizing gloss or comment on the facts, proceeding from the author, Pan Ku, himself, or some earlier scholar whose view commended itself to him.\n\nVissering, on p. 8, referring to this passage, which is partially quoted in an extract from Cheng Chia-chi, translates the words liu yu ch'\u00fcan, etc., \"it streams faster than a fountain, spreads more (widely) than cloth-parcels, is more precious than gold, and more advantageous than knives\"; and he is followed in this by the late Professor von der Gabelentz in his Chinesische Grammatik, p. 292. Beyond all question such an idiom is commonly employed in expressing adjectival comparison, but there can, I think, be little doubt that in this instance such an interpretation cannot be put upon the text.\n\nThe remaining passage, which is extracted from the Section on Money in the great Imperial Encyclop\u00e6dia, is in the nature partly of a paraphrase of, and partly of a gloss upon, the previous extract, and is from the pen, if I mistake not, of the Editors of the Encyclop\u00e6dia themselves.\n\"The Nine Officers [viz. the chiefs of the Nine Treasuries] controlled the offices for valuables and treasure,' and the objects of their control were of three classes, viz. gold, stuffs of cloth and silk, and copper money (\u9322\u5e63, ch'ien pi). The gold pieces were designated by the name Gold [cf. Gulden]; the cloths and silks were measured by the piece; the copper money was weighed by the shu. Accordingly, whenever any commodities were paid in or out, it was by means of the copper currency (\u92ad\u6cd5, yu\u00e1n fa) that their values were equalised and made convertible (\u5747\u800c\u901a\u4e4b, ch\u00fcn \u0113rh t'ung chih). Thus one catty of gold was equivalent to so many copper cash (\u9322, ch'ien); one piece of silk was equivalent to so many copper cash, and so on. In this way the Government had a standard of measure. All sorts of commodities reflected their [respective] characters\u2014of high value in the gold pieces, of utility in the knife-coins, the power of circulating in the copper currency, the power of distribution in the cloths, and of accumulation in the silks (\u4e00\u5207\u8ca1\u8ca8\u5bf6\u4e4b\u4ee5\u91d1\u5229\u4e4b\u4ee5\u5200\u6d41\u884c\u4e4b\u4ee5\u6cc9\u65bd\u5e03\u4e4b\u4ee5\u5e03\u6536\u805a\u4e4b\u4ee5\u5e1b).\n\n\"The term 'gold' indicates the 'square inch weighing one catty' of the [Ch'ien Han Shu] text; the term 'knives' indicates the 'knives forming the lowest class of valuables,' of Kuan Tz\u00fc; the term ch'\u00fcan, \u6cc9, refers to the yu\u00e1n fa, or copper currency; and the 'stuffs of cloth and silk' refer to those described as 'in length four chang the piece.'\"\n\nHere, we may note, the editors regard the terms ch'\u00fcan and yu\u00e1n fa as synonymous.\n\nIn the ensuing entries I have purposely inserted the Chinese text of passages translated only where it is really indispensable. The system of transliteration is that of Sir Thomas Wade, from which I have only departed in the cases of one or two dynastic or geographical names, such as Ta'i for Ch'i, and Ts'in for Ch'in, from a desire to follow the more usual spelling of these words, and thus avoid\na source of confusion. Words within square brackets are always comment, explanation, or amplification of my own. Thus inserted, they interrupt the reader less, I think, than when subjoined as footnotes.\n\nI wish to express my thanks to the Rev. Dr. Legge for valuable assistance given me on various points in the earlier part of the preparation of this article.\n\n*Ch'an pi*, \u9322\u5e63} Spade money, or perhaps Plane money,\n*Ch'an pu*, \u9322\u5e03} for the definitions of *ch'an* in the Shuo W\u00ean and Liu Shu Ku point to a plane or chisel rather than a spade.\n\nIn M. Lacouperie's Introduction to the \"Catalogue,\" p. xviii., we find the entry, \"*Pi tch'an*. Spade money. Name given by numismatists to the copper currency of that shape issued by private people, and afterwards regularly in the seventh century, in imitation of small implements of husbandry, which had been found convenient for barter.\"\n\nBoth Williams and Giles have *pi ch'an* in their dictionaries, but I have, so far, not met the term in any Chinese work.\n\nThe Chin Shih So heads its illustrations of these coins with the reversed and more natural form *ch'an pi*.\n\nThe Ku Ch'\u00fcan Hui classifies these so-called spade coins as *k'ung shou pu*, or hollow-headed *pu*, and says (Section Y\u00fcan, ch. 10): \"Their shape resembling a *ch'an*, they are popularly called *ch'an pu*, or spade money. The upper piece is hollow. The Chi Chin Lu says, 'the hollow was fitted with a handle to hold them by when in circulation,' and adduces from the Odes the passage '\u62b1\u5e03\u8cbf\u7d72, to carry *pu* to barter for silk.' [But the accepted interpretation of this passage holds *pu* to be cloth, and not the metal money which the Chi Chin Lu sees in the word.] The Huo Pu W\u00ean Tz\u016d K'ao says the hollow part was fitted with a vertical slip of bamboo, which was pinned in from the side to prevent it slipping out.\" Li Tso-hsien, the author of the Ku Ch'\u00fcan Hui, concurs in all the above, and adds that this type of *pu*, being mostly dug up in Chung Chou, the modern Honan province, dates probably from the Liu-Sang, or Wei dynasties [fifth and sixth\ncenturies A.D.), though some specimens must, he thinks, be earlier.\n\nM. Lacouperie regards the pu money, in the restricted sense in which he uses that term, as degenerate forms of the Spade money, but such evidence as there is affords no support to this view.\n\nCh'\u00eang ma huo, \u9a30\u99ac\u8ca8} See Pi ch'\u00eang ma.\nCh'\u00eang ma pi, \u9a30\u99ac\u5e63\nCh'i tao, \u5951\u5200. A graving knife, or knife for carving wood. The name of a coin shaped like the combination of a cash and a knife blade, issued by Wang Mang.\n\nVissering, followed by M. Lacouperie, has misunderstood the meaning of ch'i tao, which the former translates (p. 50) \"Knives to make agreements or bonds,\" and the latter by \"Bond-knife\" (Intr. p. xvii.) and \"Binding-knife\" (p. 312). Neither writer remembers to enlighten us as to what meaning they attribute to these expressions.\n\nIn the Ch'ien Han Shu the form of the character ch'i used has the radical ta, great, but the author of the Ku Ch'\u00fcan Hui, supported by the extant specimens of the coin, maintains that this form is wrong, and that the character should have been written with the radical mu, wood. The word signifies to carve, being synonymous with, and in Kanghsi defined by, \u523b, k'te, to carve. The Liu Shu Ku states that k'te implies deeper carving than ch'i. According to the Ku Ch'\u00fcan Hui, Wang Mang, who affected antiquarian tastes, reproduced in these coins an ancient variety of knife.\n\nChia ch'ien. See under Y\u00fc chia ch'ien.\n\nChien chin, \u9322\u91d1. Double gold.\n\nCouvreur in his dictionary, quoting this expression from Mencius, defines it as \"or tr\u00e8s fin qui valait deux fois l'or ordinaire.\" But M. Lacouperie, p. xix., asserts that the first word \"must be read \u9308, sickle, appropriate name of the curved knife-shape of the currency of Ts'i.\" As, however, the above character for sickle is read liem, and never kien (or chien), M. Lacouperie, to be consistent, should transliterate the phrase lien-kin instead of kien kin as he does.\nThe knives of Ts\u2019i are, moreover, quite unlike a Chinese or any other sickle. The whole statement is a mere guess which will not bear examination.\n\nCh\u2019ien, \u9322. Copper money.\n\nConsiderable obscurity surrounds the origin of the word ch\u2019ien, an obscurity that affects both the date of its introduction and the history of its meaning.\n\nIn the first place the syllable has another, probably earlier, and possibly unrelated meaning. Thus in the Odes the character occurs once, with the sound tsien, in the \u201crising tone,\u201d and standing for the name of some field implement usually translated \u201choe.\u201d So again we find in the Shuo W\u00ean, under this character, this entry: \u201cA hoe (\u92ac). In ancient times a field implement. From \u91d1, chin, metal, and \u9322, chien, giving the sound. The Odes have, \u2018prepare your hoes (\u92ac) and mattocks.\u2019 One authority says, \u2018valuables\u2019 [\u4e00\u66f0\u8ca8\u5e63].\u201d Tuan Y\u00fc-ts\u2019ai, commenting on the above passage of the Shuo W\u00ean, observes that the Elder Hsi\u00fc\u2019s edition does not contain these last four words.\n\nUnder the character \u8c9d, pei, a shell, the Shuo W\u00ean is rather more communicative, for we there read, \u201cIn ancient times they exchanged shells and prized tortoise-shell. Under the Chou they had money (\u6cc9, ch\u2019\u00fcan). By the time of the Ts\u2019in, shells went out of use, and ch\u2019ien were current.\u201d Tuan Y\u00fc-ts\u2019ai notes a suggestion that the reading here should be \u6f22, ch\u2019\u00fcan, not \u9322, ch\u2019ien.\n\nThe Shuo W\u00ean\u2019s recognition of ch\u2019ien in the sense of money may not be free from doubt, but that the word had been so used in literature before the date of its publication is certain. It is frequent in the work known as Kuan Tz\u016d. The Kuo Y\u00fc also contains it (as M. Lacouperie points out), and a commentator on the Chou Li affirms that the name Ch\u2019\u00fcan Fu, or Treasury of Money, mentioned in that work, was sometimes written Ch\u2019ien Fu. With that possible exception, the character does not seem to be met with in the Chou Li.\n\nBut there is a consensus of opinion among native\nscholars that ch'ien, as a term for money, was preceded by an earlier word, or, as some of them think, by an earlier form of the same word. This prior form is now written \u94b1 and pronounced ch'\u00fcan, and is fully treated below in a separate entry.\n\nLi Tso-hsien, the author of the Ku Ch'\u00fcan Hui, cites the T'ung Chih (I presume Ch\u00eang Chiao's work of that name) as asserting that under the Emperor Yao money was called ch'\u00fcan, while the term ch'ien did not come into use until the introduction of the \"coinage of the Nine Treasuries\" at the beginning of the Chou dynasty, or, as he considers the Kuo Y\u00fc to imply, until much later, under the Emperor Ching, the 24th sovereign of that dynasty. \"There are,\" adds Li, \"slight discrepancies in these accounts, but, summing up the evidence, we see that ch'\u00fcan was the earlier and ch'ien the later term, and that while ch'\u00fcan includes ch'ien, the latter does not include ch'\u00fcan.\"\n\nTuan Y\u00fc-ts'ai, in his notes on the Shuo W\u00ean under the word \u9322, pei, after quoting a statement of Ch\u00eang Ssu-nung that \"in old books ch'\u00fcan is occasionally found written ch'ien,\" observes that Chou dynasty authors sometimes used 'borrowed characters,' as in this case, and that the writers of the Ts'in dynasty treated the borrowed character ch'ien as the correct form. \"Hence,\" he concludes, \"it is clear that what the Ts'in and the Han called ch'ien, the Chou called ch'\u00fcan,\" adding that we have here an instance of what Chinese philologists designate \u53e4\u4eca\u5b57, ku chin tz\u016d, literally \"ancient and modern characters,\" that is, the same word written under an earlier and a later form. So, too, a commentator on the Kuo Y\u00fc is quoted by the Editors of the T'u Shu Chi Ch'\u00eang, in the Section on Money, who says, \"anciently they spoke of ch'\u00fcan, which was afterwards modified into ch'ien.\"\n\nThe question then arises, What was the cause and explanation of this substitution of ch'ien for ch'\u00fcan? The data at present seem too few to permit more than conjecture on the point. Perhaps in this substitution we\nshould see the introduction of a new and entirely unrelated term, though why, if so, the new term for circular money should be one that properly denoted a hoe or some such implement is not evident. But this clearly was not the opinion of Tuan Y\u00fc-ts\u2019ai and others. Tuan seems to imply some gradual change, apparently, of pronunciation, such that the borrowed character \u9322 answered better to the altered pronunciation of the word for money than did the former and proper character \u8ca8. This again implies that only part of the senses of this word ch\u2019\u00fcan had changed in sound, viz. the sense of money, for had all changed uniformly, there would have been no discrepancy felt and no new character needed. This variety in pronunciation would be compatible with the retention of the old sound for the probably original sense of water-spring, and the evolution of a modified sound for the secondary meaning of money.\n\nThere is still a third possible explanation. At the time when, and in the region where, ch\u2019ien first came to be used instead of ch\u2019\u00fcan, the two characters may have had the same sound, and confusion may thus have arisen. In favour of this hypothesis the character \u7dda, hsien, thread, may be brought forward. In all the accessible dialects the word itself agrees closely in sound (apart from tone and what is technically called \u2018series,\u2019 which affects the quality of the initial) with the sound of ch\u2019ien. And the character is composed of silk + a phonetic which is now \u8ca8, ch\u2019\u00fcan, but was once \u6211, or the same phonetic as that of ch\u2019ien. Hence we should infer that \u8ca8 and \u6211, and therefore \u9322, were once homophones, for the initial is really the same in all.\n\nOn the other side, it may be urged that though in the modern Chinese dialects there is no great dissimilarity between the sounds of the two words \u9322, ch\u2019ien, and \u8ca8, ch\u2019\u00fcan, and in some the approximation is very close, in the Japanese form alone is there an identical pronunciation \u2014sen\u2014for both characters. But if the modern dialects do not support this last-mentioned hypothesis, neither do they\nafford convincing evidence in disproof, and with this negative conclusion I will leave that part of the question.\n\nTai T'ung, the author of the Liu Shu Ku, has an interesting passage under the word ch'ien, in which he gives his views as to the rise of metal money. He defines the word as \"Money, \u6cc9\u5e03, ch'\u00fcan pu. In ancient times,\" he goes on, \"they carried on trade merely by using what they possessed in exchange for what they did not possess. Owing to the impossibility of an exact equivalence in value between commodities, the numberless differences in price could not be equalized. Accordingly, cloth and silk were made into currency, \u5e03, pi. Such was the origin of currency. Owing to differences of length, breadth, and texture in cloths and silks, fabrications sprang up. Hence came the use of metal knives and tortoise-shell as media of exchange, and the supply of these having been exhausted, there arose ch'ien or metal money. Thereafter commerce throughout the Empire was first made uniform. T'ai Kung established the Coinage of the Nine Treasuries, where he cast metal money, ch'ien, round externally and square internally (\u5916\u5706\u5185\u65b9), its weight being reckoned in shu. From that time onward successive ages valued it as the medium of exchange. The author Po [\u4f2f\u6c0f = ?] writes: 'the designation ch'ien was the abdication of the terms ch'\u00fcan and y\u00fcan (\u8cab).'\n\nWhat, finally, was the origin of the cash, this round coin with its distinctive square central hole, and what suggested such a type?\n\nM. Lacouperie's answer appears simple enough if we take only what he says on p. 319 of the \"Catalogue\" under the heading of \"Round Money,\" for he there derives this Round Money\u2014the cash of common parlance\u2014from an alleged Ring Money of the Chou dynasty referred to in the Shu King. But this explanation is complicated by the statement made on p. xviii. of the Introduction, under entry 24, which runs as follows: \"\u9322 Tsien, hoe money. Tsien was formerly a light instrument of husbandry, perhaps a hoe or sickle, although it is applied at present\nto the mattock.\u201d [This is an error: ch\u2019ien as a name for any field implement is unknown in modern Chinese. M. Lacouperie has misunderstood the passage of Williams to which he refers.] \u201cWhen currency in the shape of various implements of the kind was an historical fact, the term was used as a general designation . . . .\u201d\n\nIt does, I confess, seem to deserve more explanation than M. Lacouperie gives it that a word meaning hoe should have come to be specially attached to a round coin in every way unlike a hoe, and, as he contends, not derived by modification of its shape from the latter, but from a ring. However, as will be seen under Huan, \u9375, there is no evidence that the latter was a ring. Even had it been so, a mere ring has too vague a likeness to the cash type to make the identification convincing.\n\nAnother opinion is that the cash represents the round and pierced end of the handle of the old knife-coins, of which it should be considered a sort of degenerate survival, and certain knife-coins of Wang Mang the Usurper, for instance those figured in the \u201cCatalogue\u201d on pp. 311\u2013318, are pointed to as exhibiting an intermediate stage. Against this must be set the plain and unmistakable statement of the History of the Earlier Han dynasty, already cited, that coins essentially similar to the modern cash were cast as far back as the beginning of the Chou dynasty. This appears almost conclusive against the degeneration theory.\n\nI venture to suggest a different origin which had occurred to me before I found it expressly asserted in Kanghsii\u2019s Dictionary under the word \u9375, ch\u2019ien. It is that the cash is a mere reproduction in metal of the \u74a7, pi, or jade-stone token, which with the \u4e3b, kuei, resembling it in material and function though not in form, was variously used under the Chou dynasty as a badge of rank, a proof of diplomatic authority, and a sacrificial symbol. It will be seen below that the same symbolical character is attributed to the pi as to the cash, and, what is noteworthy, the same peculiar terms are used to describe the parts of each. \u201cIn the course of time,\u201d we read in Kanghsii, \u201cchanges were made.\nThe Emperor Ching cast large coins called *pao huo*. The field and the central hole had raised rims... the coins were in shape like \u74a7, *pi*, and so the terms *field* (\u8089, *jou*) and *hole* (\u597d, *hao*) were also applied to them.\"\n\nWe may devote in conclusion a few lines to the *pi*, or jade-stone token.\n\nThe Shuo W\u00ean defines the word as a \"token of jade round in shape.\" The Liu Shu Ku writes thus: \"A circular token of jade, rounded externally and having a central hole. Its substance is termed its flesh, \u8089, *jou*; the hole is called *hao*, \u597d.\" From the Shuo W\u00ean's definitions of the two characters that follow *pi* in that work, and from the Erh Ya, we also learn that when the field was double the hole, the token was called a *pi*; when the field and the hole were equal [in breadth], the name was *huan*, \u74b0; and when the hole was double the field, the token was styled a *yuan*, \u6df1.\n\n*Ch'ien fan*, \u9322\u7bc4. A mould for making coins.\n\n*Ch'ih ts\u00ea ch'ien*, \u8d64\u4ec4\u9322. Red and sloping money, or, possibly, red-edged money.\n\nThis is a name given to certain 5-*shu* pieces coined apparently in the second year of the Y\u00fcan Ting period of the Han Emperor Wu, answering to the year B.C. 115. The name was given, according to one view, because of a raised rim of red copper added to prevent the filing away of the body of the coin.\u00b9 But this is not accepted by others. The Ku Ch'\u00fcan Hui devotes a page to the point:\n\n\"The P'ing Chun Section of the Shih Chi, or Historical Records, states that the Emperor Wu directed the coinage authorities of the Capital to cast *ch'ih ts\u00ea* cash. The commentator Ju Shun observes that the raised rim was of red copper. We are ignorant,\" adds the author of the Ku Ch'\u00fcan Hui, \"of the method of casting employed, but I think that the *pan liang* coins [which preceded the 5-*shu* pieces] were not filed after casting, whereas the 5-*shu*\n\n\u00b9 Another popular and apparently similar name is given in the Chin Shih So, viz., \u5b57\u7d3a\u9322, *ts\u016d kan ch'ien*, the exact meaning of which I cannot ascertain.\ncoins were subjected to filing by the people for the sake of the copper dust, and a raised rim was accordingly added. But they continued to be filed down. As a result of filing, the colour of the rim looked new and therefore red, hence the name 'red-edged,' but there was no distinct type of coin made with that name.\" A certain Liu Ch'ing-y\u00fcan is also quoted to the effect that in Shensi he had seen 5-shu coins which were thin on the side where the character \"5\" was, and thicker on that where \"shu\" stood, so that when three of them were put one on the top of another, they looked like a horse's hoof. This presumably means that when the thicker part of each rested on the corresponding part of the one below, the outline of the three together resembled a horse's hoof seen in profile. Liu points out that in the Ch'ien Han Shu, ts\u00e9 is written \u8db3, which is defined by the Shuo W\u00ean as meaning \"inclining, sloping\" (\u5074 \u50be); the expression \u8d64 \u8db3, ch'ih ts\u00e9, then, would mean red and sloping, but the former word applies not to the rim only. Li Tso-hsien thinks this view is worth consideration.\n\nVissering has fallen into a most elementary blunder in transliterating these two characters as Yik-tseu (p. 43). What his mistake has been caused by is clear enough, though it is singular that such a slip should have escaped him in reading the proofs. He has printed \u8d64 and translated \"red\" correctly, but has transliterated the word as yik as though the character were \u8d64, \"also,\" which differs, as will be seen, by one stroke.\n\nBut if Vissering's blunder be strange, what shall we say when M. Lacouperie follows his predecessor into the same pitfall, and this not merely once, but several times, as on pp. xix. and xxx. of the Introduction, and on p. 360, though he is right on p. 326? There was only one thing left to do to complete the confusion, and M. Lacouperie has done it. On p. 404 he writes: \"It was in the first year Tch'ih-wu, \u8d64 \u9ce5 [sic], i.e. 328.\" The first year of Ch'ih-wu was A.D. 328, but the characters as printed in the \"Catalogue\" are i niao!\nChin, \u91d1. Besides its ordinary meaning of metal and gold (the latter by abbreviation for \u9ec3\u91d1, huang chin, \"yellow metal\"), this word has had also a technical sense denoting a special monetary unit, which has varied at different periods.\n\nA writer quoted in the Jih Chih Lu (ch. xi., art. \u9ec3\u91d1) as Ch'\u00ean Tsan, who is perhaps Hsieh Tsan, \u859b\u8b5e, states that under the Ts'in dynasty one yi, \u9296, made a chin, while under the Han one catty made a chin, the value of the chin thus being considerably less under the later than under the earlier line, for the catty was and is 16 liang or ounces, while the yi has been variously equated with 20, 24, or 30 ounces.\n\nYen Shih-Ku in his edition of the History of the Earlier Han has a note on the words of the text which speak of the Han using \u9ec3\u91d1\u4e00\u65a4, \"one catty of gold,\" to the effect that this was a reversion to the Chou system, but with a substitution of \u65a4, chin, a catty, for the latter's \u91d1, chin, a gold piece.\n\nNor, apparently, was it under the Chou dynasty that this gold chin unit was first known. For we find in the chapter on Yu Y\u00fc Shih, or the Emperor Shun, in the Lu Shih; a passage telling us that the money or metal pieces made by that shadowy ruler was of one chin, \u91d1, two chin, two chin four, and two chin five (what the fractional parts may have stood for is not clear), and the same authority adds that the two chin five pieces were the heaviest, and the one chin the lightest.\n\nAnd this leads us directly to another character, the relation of which to this is rather enigmatic, viz. \u9322, chin.\n\nChin, \u9322. This character appears, or seems to appear (the qualification will be explained below), on the so-called \"money of Shun\" (M. Lacouperie's Weight-Money), and on some archaic-looking round coins, figured e.g. in the Ku Ch'\u00fcan Hui, part \u5229, ch. i., pp. 4-6, and one in the \"Catalogue,\" p. 327. The legends on these round coins, at any rate, show that it represents some unit of weight or value.\nNow the character appears to cover more than one word. An analysis of the definitions and sounds given in the dictionaries shows that it is read both chin and yin.\n\nWhen read chin, it is said to mean axe or to cut with an axe, and it does not seem unlikely, therefore, that the character is a mere variant of the simpler form \u65a7, and a second way of writing the same word.\n\nBut it has also the pronunciation yin (this both in the \"upper even\" and in the \"rising\" tones). In the latter, the Shuo W\u00ean says it means to cut into two parts. (The Kuang Y\u00fcn and Chi Y\u00fcn dictionaries also attribute this sense to the character when read chin). When read yin in the upper even tone, there is still a third sense, that of a rasp or file for smoothing wood, \"like a t'ang, \u936c,\" says the Liu Shu Ku, \"but smaller.\"\n\nIf we assume that on the coins this is a single character, we may reasonably suppose also that we have to do with the sound chin meaning an axe, since that harmonises with the numismatic use of the form \u65a7, which has the same sound and sense.\n\nM. Lacouperie does assume this, and here, at least, I incline to his opinion for the reason I am about to submit. But he gives no hint that there is any doubt about the matter. And there is grave doubt. So much indeed, that the authors of the Chin Shih So and the Ku Ch'\u00fcan Hui decline to treat this combination of strokees as one character, but as two, viz. huo, object of exchange, and chin, metal. The element which in \u65a7 forms the right-hand half, and at any rate appears to be the old form of \u65a7, chin, an axe, they consider to be really a distinct character, viz. an old form of \u5316 (= the modern \u8ca8), huo.\n\nWhat makes this a difficult theory to accept is that, although the need for economy of space might explain the two characters being packed closely together on the wedge-handled pieces, no such necessity existed with the round coins above referred to, and yet, in their case also, the two elements are juxtaposed even more closely than on the wedge-handled money. The inference seems to me cogent that one character and not two is in question.\nChin ch'ien, \u91d1\u9322. Metal money.\nThe expression is found in Kuan Tz\u016d. Sometimes, as in the opening sentence of the already quoted passage from the Ch'ien Han Shu, both gold and copper are implied.\n\nChin pi, \u91d1\u5e63. Metal treasure.\nThis expression occurs in Kuan Tz\u016d, and may possibly have a wider scope than the previous one, and include mere ingots of metal.\n\nChin tao, \u91d1\u5200. Metal knives. See under Tao ch'ien.\n\nCh'ing chung, \u8f15\u91cd. Relative weight or relative value.\nThis combination is very common in works on economic subjects or matters relating to coinage. A long section of the book known as Kuan Tz\u016d is thus entitled, and \"On Values,\" or even \"On Economics\" would be a fair rendering, considering the scope of its contents.\n\nWhere metal money is in question, it is well to remember that it is not so much mere weight, as what we should speak of as a high or a low denomination that is sometimes denoted.\n\nChou kuo, \u5468\u90ed. The surrounding rim or raised edge of a coin, whether cash, knife, or pu money.\n\nCh'\u00fcan, \u6b0a. The movable hanging weight of a balance, a balancing weight; figuratively, balance, equivalence; and as a verb, to balance or be equivalent to; to adjust the balance, to try the weight of, and figuratively, to estimate.\n\nThis word need not detain us long, but there is a peculiar phrase of which it forms part, that ought not to be passed over. One version of this is \u5b50\u6bcd\u76f8\u6b0a, tz\u016d mu hsiang ch'\u00fcan, literally, \"children and mother mutually balancing;\" that is the equivalence between a unit and the sum of its fractional parts.\n\nIn another shape the expression occurs near the beginning of the second part of the Food and Commerce Section of the Ch'ien Han Shu, in a passage quoted by Vissering on p. 25, and translated, but so imperfectly that a new rendering is necessary.\n\n\"The Emperor [Ching, of the Chou dynasty] was going\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1895.\nto cast large coins, and Tan Mu Kung said, 'It must not be. In old times Heaven sent down calamities. Then they reckoned their riches and estimated values, to save the people. If the people objected to the low value [lit. lightness] of the money, then they made for them money of a higher value, and put it in circulation. Thereupon they had 'the mother balancing the children,' and the people were benefited. If the people were dissatisfied at the overhigh value of the current coin, then more coins of a smaller value were made and put in circulation, without abolishing the higher coin. In this way there were 'the children balancing the mother' also in circulation, and both small and large coins were of use.\"\n\nThe expressions I have underlined are the literal rendering of the words \u6bcd\u6b0a\u5b50, mu ch'\u00fcan ts\u00fc, and \u5b50\u6b0a\u6bcd, ts\u00fc ch'\u00fcan mu, and can hardly mean anything else than an equivalence between a unit of given value and the sum of the fractional parts into which it was divided for purposes of currency, as though, for example, the English shilling were considered the 'mother,' and the penny the 'child,' \u2014 then the mother is equal in value to the twelve children.\n\nCh'\u00fcan, \u6cc9. Closely involved with ch'ien as a numismatic term, we find the word ch'\u00fcan, either singly or combined with pu in the binomial \u6cc9\u5e03, ch'\u00fcan pu.\n\nThe present and perhaps the primary meaning (if we are justified in assuming that we know the primary meaning of a word in any language) of ch'\u00fcan is a spring of water, or more precisely, according to the Liu Shu Ku, a deep pool fed by a spring, the spring itself being called \u6e90, y\u00fcan.\n\n\"It is,\" says Tuan Y\u00fc-ts'ai in his note on the word in the Shuo W\u00ean, \"by extension that the ancients spoke of money as ch'\u00fcan pu.\"\n\nThe old form of the character was \u9322, which the Liu Shu Ku considers pictorial.\n\nM. Lacouperie correctly says (p. xvii.), \"The term was used in ancient times for currency in general, and so far\nas it was paid in, not paid out.\" He notes its occurrence in the Chou Li, or Institutes of the Chou Dynasty, and that \"One of the Treasuries of the Board of Finances derived his name, Tsiuen fu, \u6cc9\u5e9c, from it.\"\n\nCh\u00eang K'ang-eh'\u00eang, commenting on the section of the same work relating to the Wai Fu, or Office of the Exterior, which with the above-named Ch'\u00fcan Fu, had control of the money collected for the State, observes, \"the term pu, \u5e03 [currency], is equivalent to the term ch'\u00fcan,... Money when stored up was called ch'\u00fcan, when in circulation, pu, taking its name ch'\u00fcan from shui ch'\u00fcan, a spring of water, which flows in all directions. At first the ch'\u00fcan coins were of one sort only, but a second came into existence when Ching, Emperor of Chou, cast large coins, \u5927\u6cc9.\"\n\nUpon the identity of the pu with the ch'\u00fcan the native critics are in general agreed, as well as on the derivation of the latter term from the word meaning a spring, though they differ in their interpretations of the metaphor. Thus, Wang Shao-y\u00fc says: \"The money as collected was called pu, when paid in to the Treasury it was styled ch'\u00fcan, for the word pu [literally, spread or distribute] expresses the fact of its spreading gain abroad, while ch'\u00fcan indicates that this gain issues from a single orifice (\u4e00\u5b54),\" by which we are to understand presumably the spot where coins were cast, their place of issue.\n\nCh\u00eang Ngo writes: \"Money\u2014ch'\u00fcan pu as the Chou called it, ch'ien as we call it\u2014was named ch'\u00fcan in allusion to its issuing as from a spring, and pu from its unchecked diffusion.\" Elsewhere the same scholar says: \"If we inquire the reason for the terms applied to money, we shall find it denominated ch'\u00fcan from its issuing from a single orifice, and pu, because it spreads (\u5e03\u6563, pu san) throughout the realm. The money (\u94b1\u5e03, ch'ien pu) stored up in the Ch'\u00fcan Fu or Treasury was styled ch'\u00fcan and not pu, simply because the control over prices and over its storage or issue lies in the public authorities, just as a spring of water issues from a single opening.\"\n\nA rather different interpretation of the term is that of\nLi Shih-ch\u00ean, the author of the great botanical work, the P\u00ean Ts\u2019ao Kang Mu, who is cited in the T'u Shu Chi Ch'\u00eang Encyclopaedia, as follows: \"Under the Chou, T'ai Kung established the coinage (\u6cc9\u6cd5, ch'\u00fcan fa) of the Nine Treasuries. The coins, \u6cc9, ch'\u00fcan, were in structure circular with an inclosed square [hole], so many shu in weight, their complete circumfluent outline delineating a spring, for which reason they were so called.\" This extract illustrates that symbolizing tendency so dear to the Chinese mind, where it prevails perhaps as a necessary reaction from the grinding materialism of their daily life, like the backwaters in a rapid river.\n\nVery different and very interesting is the account given by the great Sung dynasty critic, Ch\u00eang Ch'iiao, or Ch\u00eang Chia-chi, as he is also called, from the place where he lived in retirement. Vissering (Chinese Currency, p. 8) has quoted the passage, omitting, however, thirty-one words near the beginning, for which reason, and because his rendering is otherwise faulty, I have made a fresh translation:\n\n\"Money was called ch'\u00fcan in allusion to its outline; chin [metal] in allusion to its material; tao [knife] in allusion to the form given to it [\u5668, ch'i]; huo [exchange] and pu [distribution] in allusion to its functions. The word money, \u9322, ch'ien, used to be, in the most ancient documents, written \u6cc9. Then it [viz., the shape of money] was altered to the common knife, and then again to the y\u00fcan fa [or round cash; a note on the text adds, 'which T'ai Kung made']. In that form it became generally diffused. The people approved of it, and accordingly, the ch'\u00fcan and knife-coins fell into disuse, and later generations did not have any knowledge of these terms. If we examine the ancient money, we find its shape is that of the Seal character for ch'\u00fcan [for which see the second paragraph of this entry], for which in after times the word ch'ien, \u9322, was substituted. Hence the character \u6cc9, ch'\u00fcan [no longer required or used for its original meaning of money], was borrowed to write the word ch'\u00fcan of shui ch'\u00fcan, a spring\nof water. The lower part of the true Seal character form of ch'\u00fcan does not consist of the character water. The early scholars, ignorant of the history of the character ch'\u00fcan, spoke of 'the onward flow of commodities being reflected in the ch'\u00fcan, their diffusion in the cloths, their high value in the gold, their utility in the knives.' Such a view is extremely forced.\"\n\nThere is both ingenuity and originality in this argument, frankly opposed as it is to the received opinions on the subject. We should, however, note two or three points arising from the statements expressed or implied by Ch\u00eang. On the one hand, it is true that the Seal form, at any rate the normal antique Seal form, as shown above, does not seem to be composed with the radical water, although the native dictionaries treat it as being so composed, even so independent an authority as the writer of the Liu Shu Ku concurring, and including ch'\u00fcan as a pictorial character. The picture, it must be confessed, is by no means convincing. On the other hand, I have met, so far, with no author agreeing with Ch\u00eang that the true and primary meaning of the term ch'\u00fcan was money, and that the same character was only used at a later date to transcribe an homophonous but distinct syllable signifying a spring. Ch\u00eang's words show moreover that he does not admit that the earlier forms of money were round, nor that ch'\u00fcan can be taken as equivalent to the y\u00fcan fa, as alleged by some. Far from that, he obviously identifies the former with the wedge-handled pieces classified by numismatists under the general designation pu, which we shall examine later.\n\nMeanwhile a comparison of the Seal form of the character with two types of pu money illustrated in M. Lacouperie's Catalogue on pages 23 and 72 is instructive. The general likeness of outline, due allowance being made for the constraining effect of conventional treatment on a perhaps originally pictorial form, though not convincing, has a certain persuasive suggestiveness.\n\nA scrutiny of the statements contained in the various\nextracts already collected shows that they support the following propositions:\n\n1. A regular metallic currency, including both square plates of gold and circular copper pieces with a central square hole, was instituted at the foundation of the Chou dynasty, as tradition asserts, by the Minister known as T'ai Kung.\n\n2. The threefold currency thus introduced is spoken of in the History of the Earlier Han dynasty as y\u00fcan fa, though the term has since been restricted to the copper coins only.\n\n3. But these earliest copper cash were at first apparently called by another name, the exact form of which is open to some doubt, but which the balance of criticism inclines to show was first ch'\u00fcan and afterwards ch'ien.\n\n4. If the substantial genuineness of the Chou Li is assumed, another denomination of this copper currency, namely pu, must have been in use either at the same time or soon afterwards.\n\nThis confronts us with the following difficulty: If the copper money was round and was called ch'\u00fcan, and if pu was merely another name for ch'\u00fcan, then the pu must have been round coins. Yet by general consent among the Chinese numismatic writers the pu are not the round but the wedge-handled and shouldered pieces. So, conversely, if the pu were of this last described type, and if ch'\u00fcan be a mere synonym of pu, then the ch'\u00fcan also could not have been round coins. Yet if the ch'\u00fcan were nothing else than ch'ien, which are expressly stated to have been originally, as now, round coins, then the ch'\u00fcan also must have been round.\n\nOut of this apparent impasse I can see only three ways of escaping.\n\nAssuming ch'\u00fcan and ch'ien to be identical, perhaps there were some that were not round coins. For example, Ch\u00eang Chia-chi may be right in declaring that ch'\u00fcan were earlier than, and of a different type from, the circular y\u00fcan fa, just as we know the knife-coins were.\nOr secondly, there may have been some pu which were not of the wedge-handled shape now exclusively associated with that name by the numismatists, and such might have been circular. There is nothing in the name pu, or \"currency,\" to limit the pieces so called to any special shape.\n\nOr thirdly, the ch'\u00fcan and the ch'ien may not have been identical. It is conceivable that the ch'\u00fcan included both the knife and the wedge-handled types, and that when round coins were cast, a new designation\u2014ch'ien\u2014was also introduced for them. The use of both ch'ien and ch'\u00fcan in Kuan Tz\u016d seems rather to make for this hypothesis, for it is hardly likely that the author would employ two distinct terms to describe exactly the same object.\n\nThere is one other explanation which would remove the difficulty, and that is to suppose the statement of the Chou Li is simply a wrong or at least an inadequate one. The genuineness of that work has of course been a vexed question.\n\nCh'\u00fcan fa, \u6cc9\u6cd5. Coinage. This expression occurs in the P\u00ean Ts'ao Kang Mu, in the passage quoted in the last entry, in place of the customary y\u00fcan fa. I have not met it elsewhere.\n\nCh'\u00fcan pi, \u6cc9\u5e63. Metal money. A synonym of the next.\n\nCh'\u00fcan pu, \u6cc9\u5e03. Currency, literally \"issue and currency.\"\n\n\"In ancient times,\" says a comment on the T'an Kung, \"they spoke of money as ch'\u00fcan pu.\"\n\nHao, \u597d. The central hole in a cash. The much smaller hole pierced in some specimens of the pi ch'\u00eang ma is also so called.\n\nThe original application of the term was to the similar central hole in the \u74a7, pi, or jade token. M. Lacouperie has evidently misread the latter character as \u74a7, pi, a wall or screen, for he renders hao, \"lit. a hole in a wall.\"\n\nHuo, \u8ca8. Exchange; object or medium of exchange; article of commerce.\n\nThis is a frequent term in the literature relating to the\nearly history of money, especially in binomial combinations with various other words.\n\nThe Shuo Wen briefly equates it with ts'ai, \u8ca1, commodities, things of value.\n\nA comment on the Chou Li, cited in Kanghsi, explains that \"gold and jade are styled huo.\"\n\nThe first page of the opening chapter of the Section on Food and Commerce in the History of the Earlier Han dynasty has the statement, \"Huo designates hempen cloth and silk which can be used as clothes, as well as metal knives and tortoise-shell, by means of which goods can be divided, profit distributed, and commerce carried on.\"\n\nIn the Ku Ch'\u00fcan Hui, part \u5143, ch. 12, p. 2, Li Tsohsien writes: \"Huo was anciently the general designation of knife- and pu- coins.\"\n\nThe etymological history of the word is not without interest. As will be remarked, the authorities quoted seem to imply a fundamental identity, or at least a close kinship, between huo and \u5316, hua, to change. In none of the modern Chinese dialects, however, is a phonetic identity to be now found. But in the Korean, Japanese, and Annamee pronunciations of the two characters, the sounds are the same.\n\nThe Kuang Y\u00fcn dictionary says, \"Huo signifies hua: objects that are changed and converted: hence the character contains [the element] hua.\"\n\nIn the Liu Shu Ku huo is always written \u8ca8, the element man being omitted, and the author thus discusses the word:\n\n\"The signification of huo is hua [which he writes simply \u5316]: that by means of which commodities are exchanged and transported. Anciently written simply \u5316. Exchange (huo) began with shells, hence the element \u8c9d, pei, shell, in the character. Money\u2014ch'ien\u2014and shells, gold and jade, when exchanged in commerce, are termed huo.\"\n\nHuo ch'ien, \u8ca8\u9322. Exchange money. This is the phrase used in the Liu Shu Ku to explain ch'\u00fcan, \u6cc9.\n\nHuo pi, \u8ca8\u5e63. Exchange treasure. This expression seems restricted to the metallic money, or perhaps rather\ningots, alleged by traditions (which are preserved, for example, in the Lu Shih) to have been made by the mythical Fuhsi and Huang Ti. The Ku Ch\u2019\u00fcan Hui contrasts huo pi with y\u00fcan ch\u2019ien or round coins.\n\n(1) Huan, \u74b0  \n(2) ,, \u9280  \n(3) Y\u00fcan or Huan, \u9322  \n(4) Y\u00fcan, \u9322\n\nThis group of four characters, though not of special importance, needs to be touched on, and the sounds and meanings correctly distinguished.\n\n(1) Huan, \u74b0. A ring of jade.\n\nSuch is the definition of the Y\u00fc P\u2019ien dictionary. The Shuo W\u00ean has, \u201cA kind of pi, \u74a7, or token of jade.\u201d And the Erh Ya, describing the several varieties of the latter, says, \u201cWhen the field and the hole are of equal breadth, the pi is called a huan.\u201d\n\nIt was by this particular kind of ring that, according to Hs\u00fcn Tz\u016d, the Sovereign in old times used to recall to favour an official previously in disgrace.\n\nThe Liu Shu Ku asserts that this word was anciently written \u9472, representing two rings linked together.\n\nThe Erh Ya contains the curious statement that \u201cknives were at first called huan, the shape being like rings,\u201d which no doubt refers to the ring-like extremities of the handles of the large knives of Ts\u2019i, the former being called huan. Many examples are figured by M. Lacouperie in the \u201cCatalogue,\u201d from p. 215 onwards.\n\nIn this connection it is worth quoting a curious and ancient example of that particular species of word-play, greatly affected by the Chinese, which may be described as a sort of pun round the corner. The Chin Shih So cites this instance from an old song. The line runs \u4f55\u65e5\u5927\u5200\u982d, that is, \u201cOn what day [will there be] a large knife end?\u201d The end of the handles of the large knives of Ts\u2019i consisted of a \u74b0, huan, or ring, which has exactly the same sound and tone as the word \u9084, huan, to return, the character required for the sense, so that the speaker\u2014doubtless a woman\u2014says one thing, implies another, and means a third.\nThe character \u74b0 is also interchanged with the third of this group, \u74b0, in its reading of huan, and also with \u5708, but only, apparently, when that is read huan.\n\n(2) Huan, \u9336. A ring.\n\nDefined by the Kuang Y\u00fcn dictionary, cited in Kanghsi, as \"a finger ring,\" while the Ch\u00eang Tz\u016d T'ung says, \"all circular discs having a hole to enable them to be strung together are known as \u9336, huan.\" This character does not appear either in the Shuo W\u00ean or the Liu Shu Ku, which latter evidently treats the preceding form, \u74b0, as the correct way of writing the word for 'ring.'\n\n(3) Y\u00fcan, \u74b0. A variety of the pi token.\n\nAccording to the Shuo W\u00ean, \"a pi with a large central hole.\" The Erh Ya informs us that \"when the hole is double the [breadth of the] field, [the pi] is termed a y\u00fcan.\"\n\nThis character is sometimes also read huan, and is then equivalent to \u74b0.\n\n(4) Huan or Y\u00fcan, \u9322. The name of an ancient weight.\n\nThe Shuo W\u00ean defines this as equalling one lieh, \u9322. (But the \"Sstich'uan edition\" has \"six lieh.\") Another determination is that of K'ung An-kuo, who held that the weight meant was six ounces of \"yellow iron,\" supposed by later scholars to be copper [see Legge's Chinese Classics, Shu King, vol. ii. p. 605].\n\nKanghsi adds, \"Also, same as \u74b0.\"\n\nM. Lacouperie's rendering of this word on p. x. of the Introduction, and on p. 319, as \"ring money,\" is unsupported by any of these authorities, as is his equation of it with \u74b0, yuan.\n\nJou, \u8089. \"Lit. the flesh, i.e. the field of the piece,\" as M. Lacouperie says, Introduction, p. xx.\n\nThis term, with hao, the hole, and chou kuo, the rim, appears in the Section on Food and Commerce, of the History of the Earlier Han dynasty.\n\nJou hao, \u8089 \u597d. This expression does not have, as M. Lacouperie supposes, the same meaning as hao alone, but stands for \"the field and the hole\" of a cash.\nKu chu, \u9f13\u9444. Literally, to smelt and cast; to cast coins. The first character does not mean, as M. Lacouperie says, a \"smelting furnace,\" but, as Kanghsi explains, to make a fire blaze up by using a fan or bellows. On p. xx. of the Introduction, the second character has not only been misprinted as shou, old age, but is also so transliterated.\n\nKuo, \u90ed. As M. Lacouperie says, \"lit. a city wall, i.e. the raised edge.\" Often distinguished as wai kuo, the outer rim, and nei kuo, the inner rim, viz. that round the central hole.\n\nLai ts\u00fc, \u840a\u5b50. The seed of the lai plant.\n\nUnder the Emperor known as Fei Ti, or \"the Deposed,\" of the Liu-Sung dynasty, the debasement of the currency was extreme. Vissering has some account of the matter from Ma Tuan-lin, where the various derisive nicknames given to the wretched little cash by the people are mentioned, such as \"Goose-eyes,\" \u9d5d\u773c, ngo yen; \"Fringe-rings,\" or perhaps \"Thread-rings,\" \u7d93\u74b0, yen huan (the allusion is not quite clear); others were called \u83dc\u5b50 or \u83dc\u5b50, lai ts\u00fc, and \u8377\u8449, hsing yeh. The appropriateness of the latter name, \"leaves of the hsing plant,\" is sufficiently shown by Bretschneider's description of this plant, Limnanthemum nymphoides\u2014\"The leaves are of a purplish red colour, they are orbicular (peltate), more than an inch in diameter. They float on the surface of the water.\" I have been unsuccessful in discovering what plant the \"seeds of the lai\" referred to, for the seeds of chenopodium, for which lai usually stands, do not appear to meet the required shape. There is one thing that is certain though, namely, that when Vissering, on p. 76, says these coins \"were called fetus (\u4f86\u5b50, lit. \"coming children\"), he took a wild leap in the dark, inasmuch as the Chinese themselves know nothing of any phrase of the sort either in the book language or the vernacular. M. Lacouperie has misprinted the character lai as \u592b [chia] on p. xix., but merely speaks of the term as \"a sobriquet,\" in a wisely non-committal manner.\nLun kuo, \u8f2a\u90ed. Synonymous with chou kuo, q.v.\n\nMan, \u8ca8. The reverse of a coin. Li Tso-hsien, in the Ku Ch'\u00fcan Hui, in view of the definition given in the Chi Y\u00fcn dictionary, \"flat and without characters,\" considers this term inapplicable to the reverses of coins having on that side a raised rim and an inscription. He, therefore, always employs the word \u80cc, pei, back.\n\nN\u00fc ch'ien, \u5973\u9322, and Kung shih n\u00fc ch'ien, \u516c\u5f0f\u5973\u9322\n\nFemale money and Male-pattern Female money, respectively.\n\nThese are names given to an issue of 5-shu pieces of the Emperor Wu of the Liang dynasty, distinguished by having no raised rims, or only a rim round the central hole. According to a writer quoted in the Ku Ch'\u00fcan Hui, in Chapter VI. of the Section on Round Coins, those cash that had a raised rim round the hole on the reverse, were called kung shih n\u00fc ch'ien\u2014freely translated, Hermaphrodite money; those that were destitute of any rim whatever, were called simply n\u00fc ch'ien, or Female money.\n\nM. Lacouperie has, without authority, altered these terms, and made an imaginary \u516c\u5f0f\u9322, kung shih ch'ien, which he translates \"male money\" (Introduction p. xix., and Catalogue p. 420), and wrongly states to be another name for the nan ch'ien, \u7537\u9322, in contrast with the n\u00fc ch'ien. The true names, however, are as given above. See also the \"Coins of the Southern Liang\" in the Chin Shih So.\n\nThe nan ch'ien, or Male money, were cash with the legend \u9f8d\u6cc9, pu ch'\u00fcan, issued probably by Wang Mang. According to Hung Tsun's Ch'\u00fcan Chih, cited in the Ku Ch'\u00fcan Hui, it was of these pieces that it was believed that a woman who wore one would have male offspring. Vissering, however, p. 83, relates this of some of the money of the Emperor Wu of the Liang dynasty, and M. Lacouperie in his entry, No. 54, Introduction p. xix., follows him, quoting him word for word, though without acknowledgment.\n\nPao huo, \u5bf6\u8ca8. Valuable exchange.\nWe now come to a small group of perplexing questions, the best way of treating which seems to be to state the difficulties as clearly as possible, in the hope that solutions may be more easily reached, if distinct issues are raised.\n\nNow we find in the Ch'ien Han Shu that \"the Emperor Ching, finding the existing coins too light, cast new and larger pieces with the inscription pao huo.\"\n\nWe are also told by Hs\u00fcn Y\u00fceh in the Han Chi, as quoted in the Ku Ch'\u00fcan Hui, that under the Chou dynasty, money was inscribed and round, with a square central hole. Ch\u00eang Chiao is also quoted to the effect that the y\u00fcan fa, or circular coins of the Chou, had on them the word huo, exchange, thus showing, it is contended, that the designation on the money at the beginning of the Chou was pao huo. The Emperor Ching retained the inscription, but enlarged it to \"4 huo\" and \"6 huo.\" Li Tso-hsien inserts figures of specimens inscribed simply pao huo, and others \"pao ss\u00fc huo\" and \"pao liu huo\" [four and six huo], and points out that the formation of the characters in all is identical, and incontestably belongs to Chou times.\n\nNow in the well-known passage of the Ch'ien Han Shu recording the institution of a currency for the Chou by T'ai Kung, the commentator adds a note that the coins were one ts'un or inch [of that period, apparently, meaning, in diameter\u2014the words are \u2014\u5bf8], and weighed nine ounces [of that period]. Ku Huan, a numismatic writer, assigns twelve shu as the weight. To both of these determinations the well-known writer Li Hsiao-mei takes exception. \"How,\" he asks, \"could coins weighing nine hang, or ounces, have been objected to in the reign of Ching as too light?\" On the other hand, \"if we suppose twelve shu to have been their weight, what addition to the latter was made by the new issue of his reign?\" for the new pieces were of that very weight.\n\nThe author of the Ku Ch'\u00fcan Hui finds these two criticisms very just, but observes that Weng I-ch'\u00fcan considers that the 12-shu pieces must refer to the new issue of the Emperor Ching. Li Tso-hsien then sums up all\nthese statements, and deduces from them that the coins which Ching thought too light were the small pieces inscribed pao huo, the earliest coins of the dynasty; that the \"new and enlarged coinage\" indicates the pao ss\u00fc huo and pao liu huo pieces, while the words of the Ch\u2019ien Han Shu, \u5b50\u6bcd\u76f8\u6b0a, literally \"equivalence between sons and mother,\" refer to the sequence of coins of which the \"sons\" are the small pao huo, and the \"mothers\" the larger and heavier pieces that succeeded them.\n\nSuch is the view of Li Tso-hsien, whom M. Lacouperie well calls \"one of the ablest and most sober of modern numismatists,\" but whose judgment in this matter he will not accept on the following grounds:\n\n\"But,\" he objects on p. xxxvii., \"this ingenious arrangement cannot be accepted: the latter coins, being inscribed, value 4 hucas, value 6 hucas, do not answer to the requirement concerning the innovation of King Wang; their mark indicates their relative value, and the actual weight of the specimens answers approximately to the standard weights; they do not therefore weigh more than the market value of the time. Moreover, a double peculiarity in their make, i.e. their outside rims, and the fact that they were cast in clusters, show beyond any possible doubt that they were not coined before the fourth century B.C.\"\n\nNow let us examine some of these statements.\n\nThe four and six huo coins, we are assured, \"do not answer to the requirement concerning the innovation of King Wang.\" Why not? They are both heavier and larger than the simple pao huo coins. As for the \"standard weights\" and the \"market value of the time,\" I have tried to understand M. Lacouperie\u2019s argument, but have not the faintest idea what he means. His next objection, however, is abundantly clear. The fact of these coins having an outside rim and being cast in clusters is fatal, in M. Lacouperie\u2019s eyes, to Li Tso-hsien\u2019s view. For, he says on p. lvi., they have rims, \"sign of a later make which the others [viz. the pao huo coins] are without,\" and on p. 329 a rimless pao huo coin is figured. But M. Lacouperie\nmust have known and ought to have mentioned that Li Tso-hsien expressly says, and shows by his illustrations, that \"both the field and the hole have surrounding rims\" (\u8089\u597d\u4ff1\u5468\u90ed). The specimen in Mr. Gardner's collection is probably a mere forgery and not a good one. Thus the fact of the pao liu huo and pao ss\u00fc huo having rims is rather in favour of Li Tso-hsien's argument than otherwise.\n\nThe only support for the statement that the casting of the pao liu huo and pao ss\u00fc huo in clusters disproves Li Tso-hsien's view, is of the strictly \"because it does\" order. M. Lacouperie says on p. xxxix., referring to the mould for casting these coins, that the latter \"have been incorrectly attributed to TCHEOU King, in 523 B.C., by whom they cannot have been issued.\" Why, he does not mention, except to refer the reader to p. lvi. for \"the reasons which indicate their issue in Ki\u00fc circ. B.C. 350.\" The \"reason\" given on that page is that \"they were most probably issued\" there.\n\nWhether the theory of the Ku Ch'\u00fcan Hui is right or not, M. Lacouperie has brought nothing stronger than assertions against it.\n\nAnother difficulty\u2014its connection with the last will be seen later\u2014is the following:\n\nThe knife-coins of Ts'i are the largest and finest of their class, but we are only concerned now with their inscriptions. On many of them are found on one side three large and clearly cut characters in an abbreviated style. There is no dispute about the first and third. All agree that they represent the modern characters \u9f50, ch'i (Ts'i), and \u8ca8, huo, the first standing for the name of the State, the last being one of the common terms for money. It is the second word that forms a standing puzzle for numismatists and antiquarians, and its very simplicity adds to its difficulty.\n\nIn the first place it seems to be, or rather, so far as form goes, it is, the old mode of writing \u53bb, ch'\u00fc, to depart or remove. But as ch'\u00fc huo is senseless, it is\ngenerally agreed that ch'\u00fc must be an abbreviation of some more complex character, or characters, but the widest divergence exists as to what the full form should be.\n\nLet us examine first the theory advanced in the \"Catalogue,\" Introduction, p. xix., where M. Lacouperie explains the symbol as \"merely a simplified form of \u975e.\" ch'\u00fc, which he renders by \"treasure,\" the binomial \u53bb\u5316 meaning, according to him, \"treasure to exchange,\" i.e. \"currency.\" The difficulty, however, in accepting this supposition is that the assumed original, an exceedingly rare word, does not appear to mean \"treasure,\" as a substantive, but only \"to treasure,\" as a verb, if we may judge from the only quotation given in Kanghsi. There a passage from the Ch'ien Han Shu is adduced in which the recipients of a certain personage's letters are said to have admired the handwriting so much that they treasured them up, \u85cf\u975e, ts'ang ch'\u00fc, as works of art. Of course this word, like ts'ang, might have been used both as noun and verb, but there is no evidence to show that it was, besides that its extreme rarity greatly reduces the probability of its use on coins.\n\nThe author of the Ku Ch'\u00fcan Hui believes that we have to do with a shortened form of \u6cd5, fa, and he explains that fa huo would mean legal or standard money. M. Lacouperie says this cannot be, as fa \"was not thus spelt in former times,\" and declares that the word \"is always written\" in a more elaborate form in old dictionaries and texts. This is inaccurate. The shorter form \u6cd5 is added in the Shuo Wen as a variant, and is also not infrequently found in the text of that work.\n\nBut Li Tso-hsien's identification, though possible, is perhaps a little far-fetched, and certainly not convincing.\n\nDifferent, and very ingenious, is the explanation put forward in the Ch'ien Chih Hsin Pien, \u9322\u5fd7\u65b0\u7de8. The author of this work would have us look upon the, apparently, three characters as standing for four, viz. \u9f4a\u592a\u516c\u8ca8, or \"Money of T'ai Kung of Ts'i,\" the two sloping strokes of \u592a, t'ai, being made to do duty also\nas the two upper strokes of \u516c; kung, the apparently simple character \u5fc5, ch'\u00fc, thus being really the above two characters welded together, a process, he declares, often met with on knife and pu-coins.\n\nOne obvious objection to this theory is that there would not be sufficient motive for the abbreviation, where space was so ample as on these knives. But the force of the objection is somewhat lessened if Li Tso-hsien (who does not hold this theory) is right in supposing that the knives with three characters are later than those with four and six, as it might be argued that the economy of space necessary at first, was continued from mere use and habit.\n\nThere seems little to be said in favour of reading the character as a variant of \u5408, ho, harmony, and an identification with \u5409, chi, lucky, which in point of conformation is very near, is negatived by the fact that on some of these knife-coins both chi, lucky, and the character under discussion occur together and are perfectly distinct.\n\nThere remains the proposal of the Ch'ien Shih T'u and the Chin Shih So to take \u53bb as an old form of \u5b9d, pao, valuable, the whole legend in this way reading Ts'i pao huo, or Money of Ts'i.\n\nThe author of the latter work asserts positively that the character usually read ch'\u00fc was an old form of pao. Of course if he is right, cadit quaestio. But such a form is not to be found in the Shuo Wen, the Liu Shu Ku, or the Liu Shu T'ung. Moreover, the form of pao huo cash discussed above is not the same nor at all similar, and though that alone is not fatal to the interpretation, it affords it no support.\n\nFor the present, then, the data seem insufficient to solve the question, which is one of considerable epigraphic interest.\n\nPi, \u5b9d. Treasures, objects of value.\n\n1 In our own Office of Works the passion for economy is carried out in such an unflattering spirit that the V.R. marked on Government furniture, boundary stones, etc., is carved thus R, a single line serving as the right-hand stroke of the V and the upright of the R.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1895.\nThis is a common and important word in all that relates to the monetary system of the ancient Chinese. It is curious that the Shuo W\u00ean defines it simply as \"silks,\" \u7d79. The Liu Shu Ku is rather fuller, and we read that \"silks which are used in friendly intercourse are called pi: money and shells are thence also termed pi.\"\n\nSo too, the great scholar Ch\u00eang K'ang-ch'\u00eang (cited in Kanghsi under the word \u5e03, pu), commenting on a passage in the Odes, declares that \"pi is what is used to buy with. This word pi is a general term for objects of exchange (\u8ca8), such as clothes and silks and metal money.\"\n\nAnd Kanghsi quotes one authority who specifies gold, jade, ivory, hides, and metal money (\u6cc9\u5e03, ch'\u00fcan pu) as pi; and another who includes horses among tributary pi; and a third who adds weapons to this list.\n\nM. Lacouperie, therefore, well renders the word on p. ix. by \"valuables (i.e. metal implements or commodities easy to barter).\"\n\nIn numismatic works the word has usually a more restricted sense. It serves there as a generic term for any of the early forms of metal money. The binomial \u9322\u5e63, ch'ien pi, is the fuller expression in this usage.\n\nKuan Tz\u016d has a passage running, \"Y\u00fc with metal from the Li mountains cast pi to relieve men's distress.\" The same statement is also found in the Lu Shih. \"This,\" says the author of the P\u00ean T'sao Kang Mu, who quotes Kuan Tz\u016d, \"was the beginning of money, \u9322.\"\n\nIt seems rather surprising that a word meaning specially silks, as we are told, and written, be it remarked, with the radical \u5e03, chin, a cloth, should have been applied, and that at an early period, to metallic money. Certainly there exists another form of the character, where the radical cloth is replaced by \u8c9d, pei, a shell, which appears a more suitable classifier for such a general term. This variant is not found in the Shuo W\u00ean, though given in the next earliest dictionary, the Y\u00fc P'ien, dating from the sixth century A.D., and in the Lei P'ien. The former work states that the form \u8c9d is the more modern one.\nPi ch'eng ma, \u9806\u4e58\u99ac \"Team money.\"\nCh'eng ma pi, \u9806\u99ac\u5e63 \"\"\nCh'eng ma huo, \u9806\u99ac\u8ca8 \"\"\nTs'\u00e8 ma huo, \u7b56\u99ac\u8ca8 \"Reckon horses money.\"\nTs'\u00e8 ch'eng ma, \u7b56\u4e58\u99ac \"Reckon teams.\"\nTs'\u00e8 ch'eng ma pi, \u7b56\u4e58\u99ac\u5e63 \"Reckon teams treasure.\"\nTang chin huo, \u55ae\u91d1\u8ca8 \"Equal to chin money.\"\nTang chin ts'\u00e8 ch'eng ma, \u55ae\u91d1\u7b56\u4e58\u99ac \"Equal to chin reckon teams.\"\nShun pi, \u821c\u5e63 \"Shun's treasure.\"\n\nThe full explanation of these grotesque-looking terms will be found further on. Meantime it will be sufficient to say that the objects to which the names are applied, the legends inscribed on them, and even the names themselves, furnish the hardest tangle of obscurities and difficulties to unravel that confronts us anywhere in this branch of inquiry.\n\nIn order to clear the ground, a good deal of destructive criticism will be necessary, inasmuch as M. Lacouperie has farther perplexed an already perplexing subject by some gratuitous and serious errors.\n\nHis observations (Introduction, p. xviii.) are as follows:\n\n16. \u9806\u4e58\u99ac Pi tch'eng ma, Saddle money;\n17. \u8eca\u99ac Ki\u00fc ma, same meaning;\n18. \u7a81\u7b56\u99ac Kia ts'eh ma, Slip-weight money;\n19. \u7b56\u99ac Ts'eh ma, same meaning.\n\nAppellatives of a curious shape of copper money, bearing its weight value, and the name of its place of issue, from the seventh to the fourth century B.C.\"\n\nTo this must be added the subjoined passage on p. 18 of the \"Catalogue,\" under the heading of \"Weight-Money.\"\n\n\"Tchang-I \u5f35\u5100, who was Prime Minister in Tchao until 357 B.C., was granted by his sovereign Su \u8096 (348-325 B.C.) the privilege of issuing Ki\u00fc-ma \u8eca\u99ac money. Such was one of the appellatives of this class of currency. Another one was Pi tch'eng ma \u9806\u4e58\u99ac, or 'Riding Money,' so called from its likeness of shape to that of a saddle. But the oldest was Kia ts'eh ma, \u7a81\u7b56\u99ac, or\nbetter Ts'eh ma, \u7b56\u78bc, 'Slip-Weight Money,' whence Weight-Money.\"\n\nThus M. Lacouperie. Now for a methodical examination of his statements.\n\n16. Pi ch'\u00eang ma cannot possibly mean Saddle money, and in so naming it M. Lacouperie has supplied a conjectural reason for an imaginary fact. It could, however, have meant \"riding money,\" if the second word of the phrase were in the 'lower even' tone, for ch'\u00eang ma then means to mount a horse, but, as we shall see, the word is to be read in the 'departing' tone, and then the meaning of ch'\u00eang ma is a team of four horses.\n\n17. No such expression as \u8eca\u99ac, ch\u00fc ma, is applied to any form of money. This is one of the worst of the errors into which the author of the \"Catalogue\" has fallen. I shall return to it shortly.\n\n18. I believe I am correct in saying that no such phrase as \u7b56\u7b56\u99ac is to be found, but that it is in some way due to a confusion on M. Lacouperie's part, arising from the word ts'\u00ea, \u7b56, being sometimes written \u7b56, the normal sound of which is chia (kia), but which when used for \u7b56 also takes the same sound\u2014ts'\u00ea. But had such a phrase existed, it could not possibly mean \"slip-weight money,\" if indeed those three words convey any meaning, which to me they do not.\n\n19. Ts'eh ma, \u7b56\u99ac, has the same meaning, we are told. But on p. 18 we find this phrase \"better\" written \u7b56\u78bc. What does M. Lacouperie mean by \"better\"? Neither in Kuan Tz\u016d, whence the actual terms are derived, nor in any of the coin books I have examined, is ts'\u00ea ma ever written with the character \u78bc, which does mean a weight, whereas \u99ac means a horse. One of the two must be chosen. Both cannot be right. If \u99ac, a horse, be selected, a weight must be abandoned; if \u78bc, a weight, be chosen, the authority should be given, for it is altogether inconsistent with the history of the term, as I shall show shortly.\n\nBut before doing this, we must go back to the words ch\u00fc ma, literally \"carriage and horses,\" which for the\nmoment stop the way. The explanation is very simple, and M. Lacouperie had little reason for falling into so disastrous an error.\n\nBesides the passage quoted above from p. 18, the author writes on p. lii. of the Introduction, \"the king of Tchao issued ki\u00fc ma currency (\u91d1\u5e63\u8eca\u99ac) or saddle money, and granted the use (\u5949\u4ee5\u8eca\u99ac\u91d1\u9322) of it to Tchang Y, a political adventurer from Ts'in, where he returned in 317 B.C.\" A statement in the same sense appears on p. xiv. under the years 325\u2013317 B.C.\n\nThe two passages which M. Lacouperie quotes are from the original narrative in the Chang I Chuan, or Memoirs of Chang I, in the Shih Chi. Not only has he completely misunderstood the text, but he has mistaken the fundamental facts of Chang I's relations to the States of Chao and Ts'in.\n\nChang was never \"Prime Minister in Chao,\" nor was he, when he came to that State, an \"adventurer from Ts'in,\" nor did the Prince of Chao ever grant him \"the privilege of issuing\" money.\n\nChang I came as a penniless adventurer to Chao to seek his friend and former fellow-student, Su Ts'in, who, and not Chang, was Prime Minister to the Prince of that State. Su did not give the new-comer the welcome he looked for, and Chang left the country to try his fortunes in Ts'in. Su Ts'in seems to have desired that Chang should succeed in gaining access to the ruler of Ts'in, and as that would have been difficult for a needy adventurer, he used his influence with the Prince of Chao in the way explained in the following passage from the above-mentioned Memoirs:\n\n\u8d99\u738b\u767c\u91d1\u5e63\u8eca\u99ac\u4f7f\u4eba\u5fae\u96a8\u5f35\u5100\u8207\u540c\u5bbf\u820d\u7a0d\u8fd1\u5c31\u4e4b\u5949\u4ee5\u8eca\u99ac\u91d1\u9322\u6240\u6b32\u7528\u70ba\u53d6\u7d66\u800c\u5f17\u544a\u5f35\u5100\u9042\u5f97\u4ee5\u898b\u79e6\u60e0\u738b\n\n\"The Prince of Chao gave out money (\u91d1\u5e63), and a carriage and horses (\u8eca\u99ac), and sent a messenger to follow Chang I unobserved, to lodge in the same places as he, and gradually to grow intimate with him, putting at his disposal (\u5949) the carriage and horses and the money (\u91d1\u9322), and\nproviding for him whatever he might stand in want of, without telling him [probably, \u201cwho had really provided it,\u201d should be understood]. In this way Chang I was able to gain access to Prince Hui of Ts\u2019iin.\u201d\n\nNever, surely, have a carriage and horses been put down and turned into money, to meet a less urgent necessity!\n\nFor the true explanation of these terms we must turn to the works of Kuan Tz\u016d, where, in the Section entitled Ch\u2019ing chung, or Economics, the clue is to be found.\n\nPut in the briefest possible way, the facts are these: Native numismatists have identified certain forms of the pu type of money as surviving examples of the pi, or metal \u201ctreasures,\u201d said by Kuan Tz\u016d to have been used by the Emperor Shun in connection with his system of taxation and administration. To that system Kuan Tz\u016d gives the name of \u7b56\u4e58\u99ac\u4e4b\u6578, ts\u2019\u00ea ch\u2019\u00eang ma chih shu, shortened sometimes to ts\u2019\u00ea ch\u2019\u00eang ma, which expressions mean literally, \u201cto devise, or the devising of, the scheme of teams of horses.\u201d This again may be interpreted either in a literal sense, which on the whole seems to me the more natural, as the system [of taxation] based on teams of horses; or, as the Chinese critics themselves seem to prefer, the words may be taken figuratively as the management of the team of State by the Imperial driver, in which case ts\u2019\u00ea must be given its meaning of a switch, or to use a switch. As I hope to show, this fiscal system was one in which a definite area of cultivated land was assessed as liable to provide one chariot and four horses fully equipped for the armed forces of the State.\n\nIf the Ch\u2019ing chung Section is from the hand of Kuan Tz\u016d, or even if it embodies and combines genuine older materials, the contents deserve attention as an outline\u2014and often more than that\u2014of the agrarian policy of the prehistoric dynasties believed to have preceded that of Chou, and to have witnessed under the legendary Emperor Shun the first beginnings of the use of money. I trust then it may not be out of place to append here a close paraphrase of the opening chapter of this Section on \u201cEconomics,\u201d\nthe less so as the function of pi or treasure, probably in some metallic form, is also illustrated.\n\nThe text is thrown into the form of dialogue between the Duke Huan of the State of Ts'i and his Minister Kuan, generally styled in this work Kuan Tz\u016d.\n\nThe Duke asks Kuan Tz\u016d to explain to him the ch'eng ma.\n\nThe Minister replies in that oracular manner which might in these hurrying times be deemed irritating, but which seems to have enjoyed considerable vogue in days of yore, \"The State's lack of stores comes from the Ruler's commands.\"\n\n\"How so?\" inquires the Duke.\n\n\"One farmer,\" is the reply, \"can only till a hundred mou of land. The labours of Spring are limited to the twenty-five days.\"\n\n\"And what are the twenty-five days?\"\n\nKuan Tz\u016d replies: \"Sixty days after the winter solstice, the surface of the ground thaws; seventy days after, the ground below the surface thaws. Then the farmer sows his millet. After one hundred days from the solstice, he ceases sowing. Thus the labours of Spring are limited to twenty-five days. The Rulers of these times now build Palaces, and the people all have to work at them. If Spring is allowed to pass without stopping the work, the people lose 'the twenty-five days,' and all the land from which they are drawn will be neglected land. If one man is forced to work at this corv\u00e9e, a hundred mou go untilled; if ten men, then a thousand mou, and so on. After Spring is past, there are Rulers who still exact corv\u00e9e in the Summer. In this way, the fruits alike of Spring and Summer are lost. When corv\u00e9e is not stopped even in Autumn, then the saying applies that 'crops and land are lost several times over.' When the season has passed without crops, the merciless Ruler still exacts his taxes. The share of the harvest required to feed the people is five-tenths, and the Ruler has already exacted nine-tenths, and sometimes even, in default of grain, will cruelly demand\ntreasure (\u5e63, pi) instead. It is by such conduct that lawlessness arises and penalties abound.\"\n\n\"Excellent!\" somewhat hurriedly observes the Duke, and continues, \"Pray explain fully to me the policy of the Ts'\u00ea ch'\u00eang ma (\u7b56\u4e58\u99ac\u4e4b\u6578).\"\n\n\"Those Rulers [i.e. of antiquity],\" answers the Minister, \"did not take the time of the people, and so the crops were plentiful, the officials (\u58eb) needed but light salaries, and the people but scanty donations. The wise Rulers of those times caused the farmers to plough in the winter and to weed in the summer, and fruits of their labours fell to the Ruler. The women being diligent at their needlework, their weavings accrued to the Treasuries. The motive for this [levy on the produce of men and women's toil] was not to grieve or afflict the people, but because the scheme of fiscal control required that thus it should be.\"\n\nThe Duke then asks how such a policy may again be carried out.\n\nHis Minister answers: \"In the State of Y\u00fc [\u6709\u865e\u570b\u2014the native State of Shun] was devised the system of Ch'\u00eang ma. That system was one of grants made to the man of a hundred mou.\" [There here seems to be a lacuna in the text, which continues as though the ancient Ruler\u2014perhaps Shun\u2014were addressing the people.] \"'In general, the twenty-seven [sic] days are the time of your Spring labours, and of assisting you with treasure (\u5e63). When your Spring and Autumn harvests are plentiful, the State's share of your grain will be a heavier levy.' Addressing the farmers [sic], he said, 'The value of the treasure (\u5e63, pi) in your hands will be reckoned in grain and stored in the district granaries. The share of the grain due to the State is first and foremost [\u5728\u4e0a, in orig.]. The importance of that share is tenfold, as providing the salary of the various officials of all sorts. When implements and arms are furnished in full, then a State exists. In the absence of treasure, the equivalent in grain is fixed. Of the State's provision for contingencies [literally, screens], 90 per cent. consists of grain repaid [as taxes] to the State,\nand of grain to meet [expenses]. Arms being fully provided, there is no further levy for them from the people.' Such was the ts'\u00ea ch'\u00eang ma of Yu Y\u00fc.\"\n\nTo this passage I must add another short one from the ninth chapter of the same Section. Translated, it runs as follows:\n\n\"Duke Huan asked Kuan Tz\u016d as to the pi ch'\u00eang ma (\u5e63\u4e58\u99ac).\n\n\"Kuan Tz\u016d replied: 'At first taxes were levied from the establishments of the three grades of Great Officers (\u4e09\u5927\u592b\u4e4b\u5bb6), one chariot and team of horses with twenty-seven men to serve it for each piece of land of six square li [\u65b9\u516d\u91cc]. As to the pi ch'\u00eang ma, if a piece of land of that size were of such and such a quality, the yield of grain would be of such and such a quantity, and the value of the grain of such and such an amount. For each such area of land, then, so many treasures, or pi, were used [presumably in payment of the tax], and according to the heaviness of the crop upon it [also], so many pi. Hence by this pi ch'\u00eang ma system, these pi were distributed throughout the State, were a measure of the cultivable land of the realm, and were known by the name of pi ch'\u00eang ma.'\"\n\nIt remains to analyse the various terms at the head of this entry, which designate the supposed survivors of these ancient treasure-tokens.\n\nThe first is pi ch'\u00eang ma, a strange-looking compound, for the syllable pi, which I believe is never found except as a substantive, seems, at any rate at first sight, to be used adjectively here, and even so the expression is difficult to explain. The clue appears to be given in the following sentence, which occurs a little further on than the passage last referred to: \u8ecd\u570b\u4e4b\u7b56\u8ca8\u5e63\u4e58\u99ac\u8005\u4e5f. Slightly expanded, this means, \"the plan which serves as the cross-piece to the pole of the car of State [that is, which enables the driver to control the horses, or, in other words, the sine qua non of continuous existence as a State] is the huo pi ch'\u00eang ma system.\"\nHere, instead of the previous pi ch'\u00eang ma, we have the fuller and more intelligible combination huo pi ch'\u00eang ma, which appears to stand for \"metal currency (huo-pi) and the [system of taxation known as] ch'\u00eang ma.\"\n\nCh'\u00eang ma pi and Ch'\u00eang ma huo, which occur in coin-books, are, of course, nothing but \"money of the ch'\u00eang ma system.\"\n\nTs'i'e ch'\u00eang ma pi, or Ts'i'e ch'\u00eang ma, or Ts'i'e ma huo, various forms of the same term, are names based on the statement as to Shun's taxation already quoted above, where the alternative explanations of the phrase are given.\n\nTang chin huo (and in the Lu Shib, Tang chin ts'i'e ch'\u00eang ma). This name has come into use from the fact that the two characters \u55ae\u91d1, tang chin, in the old script, are found on many of the pieces of this type. The current opinion among the native writers is that the chin here refers to a unit of value, which has already been discussed under a separate entry.\n\nShun pi, or \"Shun's treasure,\" explains itself.\n\nOn the whole, the evidence seems to me insufficient to decide whether these curious pieces with their enigmatic legends are rightly identified with the pi or treasure which Kuan Tz\u016d describes as in use in Shun's time. They have a very archaic look, but the true reading of the inscriptions is still exceedingly doubtful. It appears not unlikely, however, that they offer us the oldest form of the pu type that has come down to our times. It would be interesting to discover what that form represents.\n\nPo hs\u00fcan, \u767d\u9078. Meaning somewhat uncertain, but probably, \"White and choice.\"\n\nAmong various coins issued by the Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty, there were three types known to numismatists apparently by tradition only, and called respectively Dragon-money, Horse-money, and Tortoise-money. They are described as being made of an amalgam of silver and tin. The Dragon-money was round, symbolizing Heaven, and having the figure of a Dragon encircling a central round\nhole. The name, it is recorded in the Section on Food and Commerce of the Ch\u2019ien Han Shu, was Po hs\u00fcan, the import of which is probably as rendered above.\n\nVissering, On Chinese Currency, p. 40, gives the traditional illustrations of the three coins, as well as the text relating to them from Ma Tuan-lin, but he reads \u767d, y\u00fceh, to say, instead of \u767d, po, white. This is also the reading in some texts in the Ch\u2019ien Han Shu, but not that followed by the editors of Kanghsia, who have \u540d\u767d\u64b0, ming po hs\u00fcan, \u201cit was named Po hs\u00fcan.\u201d Vissering translates, \u201cits name shall be tshuan\u201d (a wrong transliteration, as a reference to Kanghsia shows), adding in a note that the word \u201chas the signification of regulator, a pattern.\u201d It has no such meaning. M. Lacouperie has, again without acknowledgment, closely followed Vissering in this error. On p. xix. of the Introduction, he has \u201c\u64b0, Tchwan, pattern,\u201d and words to the same effect on p. 358, in both cases omitting all mention of the first part of the name.\n\nPu, \u5e03. (1) Cloth, (2) Currency.\n\nThe treatment of the term pu requires some little care, because it appears in connection with the early history of money in two senses which need to be sharply distinguished. The first of these senses, and the only one mentioned in the Shuo W\u00ean, is that of hempen cloth. The second is that of a metallic currency.\n\nIt is, according to Kanghsia (s.v. \u5e03), synonymous with ch\u2019\u00fcan, \u8ca8, in the sense of money, and Yen Shih-ku is quoted to the same effect,\u2014\u201cpu is the same as ch\u2019ien. It is so termed to express its distribution (\u5206 \u5e03) and general currency.\u201d\n\nVissering is confused and misleading in regard to this word of double functions, and M. Lacouperie also, in some degree, fails to observe the distinction sufficiently.\n\nThe Shuo W\u00ean and the Liu Shu Ku both consider the meaning of \u201ccloth\u201d to be the original one, and the latter asserts that the character was \u2018borrowed\u2019 to write the pu in chan pu (\u5c55 \u5e03), to spread out, unfold, and in hs\u00fcan pu (\u5b9c \u5e03), to spread abroad, proclaim, whence it came also to\nbe used for the pu in huo pu (\u8ca8\u5e03), currency of exchange, from the meaning of diffusion or distribution (\u6d41\u5e03), borne by that term. So, too, Tuan Y\u00fc-ts\u2019ai, in his notes on pu in the Shuo W\u00ean, holds that the general sense of distribution is derived by extension from that of cloth.\n\nIt is more likely, however, that the reverse is the case, and that the original sense of pu is the general one, equivalent to our word spread. Of this, \u201ccloth,\u201d or literally \u201cspreading,\u201d as a term for a fabric with a certain spread of surface, would be a particular application. And a currency of metal would be a second specialized use of the parent word, applicable to any form of money, from its widespread diffusion as a circulating medium.\n\nVissering has not realised this. Thus on p. 3 of his work he translates Ma Tuan-lin\u2019s \u5546\u4eba\u9f4a\u4eba\u8b02\u4e4b\u5e03 by \u201cthe people of Sang and Ts\u2019i called it Pu, a hempen or silk piece of cloth,\u201d and immediately afterwards, \u201cThe money of the first three dynasties . . . was made of three different sorts of metal, yellow, white, and red, and consisted further of cloth, knives, and tortoise-shells.\u201d In both instances it is clearly the metallic pu that are intended to be understood.\n\nM. Lacouperie has the following entry, on p. xviii.: \u201cPu, cloth, afterwards money. First applied to hempen or silk pieces of cloth. Used as a medium of exchange and regulated into a currency in 1091 B.C., it [sic, Qy. the term] came into use in a looser way as money, and was especially applied to all small plates of metal employed for currency, except the knives. It is chiefly applied by numismatists to the small shape of money derived from the spade and saddle money.\u201d On the same page, he translates huo pu by \u201cexchangeable (cloth) money,\u201d and ch\u2019ien pu by \u201choes and cloth\u201d; so, on p. xii., \u201cPus (hoes or adzes),\u201d while on p. 32, speaking of these pu-coins, he says, \u201cTheir name pu, \u5e03, which means \u2018spread out,\u2019 was used in olden times for this money in the Ts\u2019i State.\u201d\n\nSo far as I can follow M. Lacouperie, I suppose him to consider that the term pu means cloth, but that the metal\nshape to which the term was applied represents a hoe or an adze.\n\nNow it may again be pointed out that we learn from the Ch\u2019ien Han Shu that there was a medium of exchange consisting of pieces of hempen cloth, and also of silk, of definite size, forty Chinese feet in length, and two feet two inches in breadth. It is to these ancient \u201cpiece-goods\u201d that the common expression \u5e03\u5e1b, pu po, or \u201ccloths and silks,\u201d is applied.\n\nBut when a currency of copper is denominated pu, it assuredly cannot be associated with such cloths. Could there be a more infelicitous name for a small piece of metal money than \u201ca cloth\u201d? Vissering does indeed put forward an explanation, but, so far as I am aware, it is not supported by any historical evidence. He says on p. 4: \u201cHempen and silk cloth and knives were the earliest articles of trade generally used for money, and as the first weighed metallic money was an imitation of the shape and a representation of those articles, the same denominations remained to designate those coins. The pu-coins represent a piece of cloth, a dress, and the tao-coins are in their outward form an imitation of a sword or knife.\u201d He further thinks that the likeness between the character \u5e03 and the form of the coin so named can be traced. Vissering\u2019s statement that the first \u201cmetallic money was an imitation of the shape and a representation of\u201d knives, seems probable enough, but surely not of a piece of cloth (for pu does not mean \u201ca dress\u201d). We are told exactly the dimensions of the cloths, which were long strips of uniform breadth, whereas the pu-coins are wedge-handled, shouldered plates, the lower part of which is broader than the handle. The latter is usually pierced, and the lower edge of the coin is always interrupted by a deep wedge-shaped or elliptical opening, as may be seen in M. Lacouperie\u2019s abundant illustrations of the series. If the pu are imitations in metal of strips of cloth, how are these peculiarities of design to be explained? Whatever may have suggested the shape of these odd-looking coins, it can hardly have been a simple length of\ncloth. The coincidence of the name is probably responsible for Vissering's hypothesis, and one may surmise that Ch\u00eang Chia-chi's ingenious theory as to the ch'\u00fcan has also had something to do with it. In fact, however, these very pu-coins seem to be the \"ancient coins\" to which Ch\u00eang refers as originating the old seal-character form of ch'\u00fcan.\n\nAccepting as beyond dispute the meaning of \"metal currency\" for pu, we may note that in the Chou Li it is by this designation only that money is spoken of, unless we except the title of Ch'\u00fcan fu, or Treasury of Money, where alone we meet the word ch'\u00fcan. Further, the Ku Ch'\u00fcan Hui (vol. i. \u51e1\u4f8b, p. 2) represents Kuan Tz\u016d apparently as stating that at the beginning of the Chou dynasty, y\u00fcan fa (which the K.C.H. always treats as round coins) were called pu. I have not found this statement in Kuan Tz\u016d, but it may be there.\n\nM. Lacouperie in his \"Catalogue\" has made a separate division for certain specimens of early money to which he has given the title of \"Weight-Money.\" The pieces of this type in Chinese coin-books are, with others, often styled \u7570\u5e03, i pu, that is, exceptional or unusual pu. There are other names which are discussed under the entry Pi ch'\u00eang ma, but to my thinking it would have been better to have treated these coins as a subdivision of the pu than to set up a separate class for them. The so-called \"Weight-Money\" bears a strong general resemblance to the ordinary pu-coins, being usually distinguished by having rounded instead of angular shoulders, and a conical or segmental concavity replacing the wedge-shaped opening of the normal pu. But the type seems the same, and we may perhaps regard M. Lacouperie's \"Weight-Money\" as the archaic predecessor of the angular pu.\n\nAs we have already seen, M. Lacouperie asserts that the pu are hoes, but he does not attempt to meet the obvious objection that they do not resemble the Chinese hoe, nor to account for the very characteristic opening in the lower edge.\n\nI venture to put forward the following theory as a possible explanation in the absence of any other. It involves an\nexamination of two terms, ch'iao and ch'a, which occur both separately and also in a binomial combination. These are names of two ancient implements of tillage very similar, it would seem, in function. When the binomial is used, it probably stands not for \"the ch'iao and the ch'a,\" but for the ch'iao variety of the ch'a, the latter term being generic. The character \u947f, ch'iao, is not in the Shuo Wen; but in the Liu Shu Ku it is defined as \"a sort of \u947f, ch'a. Used to shovel away earth and other things.\" In combination, as noticed above, we have \u947f \u947f as a distinct term.\n\nAs for \u947f, ch'a, it is a character with two meanings. In the Shuo Wen it is described as a pestle for husking grain. But this alleged meaning is not represented in literature, at least, no example is cited in Kanghsii. Ch'a, however, has also the meaning of a spade or shovel, a fact which Tuan Y\u00fc-ts'ai explains as due to 'borrowing.' And the Shuo Wen itself, though silent as to this sense when defining the word, repeatedly defines other terms for implements of the nature of spades or shovels, as \u947f \u947f \u947f, \"a sort of ch'a.\" In fact, as will be seen under the character ch'iao in Kanghsii, ch'iao and ch'a are synonyms, but are used in different localities.\n\nNow in the Shantung sculptures which form the subject of M. Chavannes' fine work, \"La sculpture sur pierre en Chine,\" and which have also been very well reproduced in the Chin Shih So, we find in several instances an implement represented to which I would draw attention. It looks like an abortive tuning-fork, or a hybrid between a two-pronged fork and a spade. One example occurs in the ninth panel of the chamber of the \"pseudo-Ou L\u00e9ang,\" where the Emperor Y\u00fc is figured holding it in his right hand. M. Chavannes calls it merely \"un instrument aratoire,\" but the authors of the Chin Shih So in their notes on their woodcut describe it as a \u947f \u947f, ch'iao ch'a. We meet it again twice in the curious sets of figures forming the third row of the first stone of the Posterior Chambers (Chavannes, plate xxix.). In the Chin Shih So the pictures represent\nthe figures on a white background, and are therefore far more distinct than the plates in M. Chavannes' volume. The authors of the Chinese work here describe the winged personages who hold this implement as \"grasping a two-bladed ch'a (\u5169\u5203\u925e, liang j\u00ean ch'a),\" not, as in the previous instance, a ch'iao ch'a. Now these words liang j\u00ean ch'a form the Shuo W\u00ean's definition of the spade-shaped instrument known as a hua, and in modern times (but not in the Shuo W\u00ean) written \u936c. Tuan Y\u00fc-ts'ai, in a long and valuable note, has these observations\u2014\"The words 'two-bladed ch'a' mean a ch'a both sides of which have an edge (or blade). A ch'a is an implement for cutting into the soil.\" This interpretation would agree with the illustration of a hua given in the T'u Shu Chi Ch'\u00eang better than with the view of the authors of the Chin Shih So, who presumably see in the two flattened prongs the \"two blades\" mentioned by the Shuo W\u00ean.\n\nBut for my argument it does not matter whether the implement figured is a hua, a ch'iao ch'a, or some other. That an agricultural tool of such a shape did exist once is certain from these sculptures, and the conclusion I venture to suggest is that in this implement, whatever its name and exact use, we have the formal origin of the pu-coins.\n\nPu ch'\u00fcan, \u5e03\u6cc9. Currency.\n\nThis expression, the ordinary phrase ch'\u00fcan pu reversed, was not only the legend on one of the various kinds of pu issued by Wang Mang, but it also occurs in Kuan Tz\u016d, e.g. in ch. 24, p. 9\u2014\"The nobles of the Empire brought gold, gems, grain, ornamental fabrics (\u6587\u91c7, w\u00ean ts'ai), and currency (\u5e03\u6cc9, pu ch'\u00fcan), to pay to Ts'i in exchange for its stone tokens (\u77f3\u58c1, shih pi).\"\n\nSh\u00ean lang ch'ien, \u6c88\u90ce\u9322. Sir Sh\u00ean's money.\n\nVery small cash\u2014some are hardly larger than a silver penny\u2014were cast under the Tsin dynasty, by a personage named Sh\u00ean Ch'ung, \u6c88\u5145. The Ku Ch'\u00fcan Hui extracts the following passages relating to their issue:\n\n\"The Section on Food and Commerce in the History of the Tsin dynasty records that at Wu Hsing [now\nHuang Chou fu in Chehkiang], Sh\u00ean Ch'ung also cast small cash known as Sh\u00ean lang ch'ien, or Sir Sh\u00ean's money.\"\n\nThe second passage, from the Chi Chin Lu, runs thus: \"The Emperor Ming, of the Wei dynasty, resumed the coinage of the 5-shu pieces, which continued in use until the Tsin dynasty. Sh\u00ean Ch'ung, however, lessened their size while keeping the same inscription.\"\n\nSuch is the commonplace story of the designation of these diminutive coins. Vissering does not allude to them; but M. Lacouperie has this brief and staggering entry, on p. xix. of the Introduction\u2014\n\n\"49. \u4e0d\u6c88\u90ce Puh tch'en lang, unsinkable lads.\"\n\nHaving supplied the negative, pu, which does not form part of the name, and omitted the word ch'ien, money, which does, and taken \u6c88 in its meaning of \"sink,\" and its sound ch'\u00ean (tch'\u00ean), instead of correctly reading it sh\u00ean, a surname, he finally renders lang by \"lads\" (a meaning the character often has), whereas it is really here a suffixed honorific. Surely the restoration has been carried rather far in this case!\n\nTao, \u5200, or Chin tao, \u91d1\u5200, or Tao ch'ien, \u5200\u94b1, or Tao pi, \u5200\u5e63. Knives, or Metal knives, or knife money, or knife-treasure.\n\nThis curious variety of coin, if that term may be applied to it, forms the third of the types into which all Chinese copper money falls.\n\nKuan Tz\u016d speaks of gold and \"knife-treasure,\" tao pi, circulating among the people (Ch'ing-chung, Section 6), and of tao pu, \"knives and pu money,\" being stored in the official treasuries (loc. cit., Section 9, folio 25). And in numismatic works the knives are constantly associated with the pu-coins in the expression tao pu, \"knives and pu,\" as distinguished from the round cash\u2014chin ch'ien or yuan fa. Thus the P'ing Chun Shu Section of the Shih Chi says, \"When the way of commerce was first opened to husbandmen, craftsmen, and traders, valuables of tortoiseshell, metal coins (\u91d1\u9322), and knives and pu (\u5200\u5e03) came into use.\"\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1895.\nOn the first page of the Section on Food and Commerce in the Ch'ien Han Shu, we find mention of \"metal knives and tortoise-shell, with which wealth was divided and gain distributed.\"\n\nThe Ku Ch'\u00fcan Hui cites the T'ung Chih, or Memoirs of Ssu-ma Ch'ien, for the statement that money was known as \"knives\" in the States of Ts'i and Ch\u00fc, which occupied part of the modern province of Shantung; and it seems to be the fact that all the specimens that have come to light have been dug up in Shantung, except a few of the so-called \"Ming knives,\" which were found in the neighbouring province of Chihli. Of the \"large knives of Ts'i\" especially, the Ku Ch'\u00fcan Hui says that they have all been excavated from Ts'i territory, and adds, what is noteworthy, that they belong undoubtedly to the system of T'ai Kung's Nine Treasuries. This proves that that system in the view of some of the native critics could not have been restricted to the issue of round money exclusively. The same work observes that \"it has never been contested that the knife money dates from the Chou and Contending States' epochs\"\u2014say from B.C. 1120 to B.C. 250.\n\nThe Chin Shih So, referring to the specimens which in the \"Catalogue\" are Nos. 44 and 1029, considers they must date from an earlier period than the other knives, and, recalling the old legend contained in the Lu Shih, that \"Huang Ti fashioned metal knives and instituted the Five kinds of treasure, pi,\" remarks that assuredly knives did not make their first appearance in the State of Ts'i.\n\nBut if knives were used as money in any other region than Shantung and Chihli, and specially the former, there seems to remain no record of the fact.\n\nM. Lacouperie on p. xi. of the Introduction, under the years B.C. 679\u2013675, informs us that \"The State of Ts'i being at war during these years, Prince Hwan was finally afraid that his armoured bannermen were not sufficient in number: in order to facilitate enlistment he successfully authorized the payments of mulcts for slight offences with\ntheir own metal knives, instead of the legal Ring currency, as heretofore since 950.\"\n\nOn p. 213 of the \"Catalogue\" we also find the following passage:\n\n\"The introduction of the Knife money in the state of Ts'i, conterminous with the above [Shantung] peninsula, is attributed in a rather legendary way to the following circumstances, circa 650 B.C. At the eve of an expedition, the soldiers of the Duke Hwan, of Ts'i, proved dissatisfied with the stringent regulations on weights and money which had previously been enacted by the Prime Minister Kwan-Tze (see pp. 4, 18, and Introduction). Their General, afraid of their being disloyal, granted to them the authorization of making use of their metal knives for barter. The people were delighted with the innovation, which was giving them a more convenient medium of exchange, and adopted it eagerly. Hwai-nan tze, who died in 122 B.C., and to whom we are indebted for the preceding story, says that in his time they were still faithful to the practice, and, despite the changes and modifications which had happened in the currency, they continued to cast knife money similar to the patterns of former times.\"\n\nI cannot account for this episode being attributed by M. Lacouperie to Huai Nan Tz\u016d. As the extract from the latter author which follows, does not agree with M. Lacouperie's summarized narrative, and as no closer reference than to the Chinese author at large is given, I had the whole of his works searched through by a native scholar, with the result that no such story could be found, the only passage bearing upon the subject at all, apparently, being this:\n\n\u9f4a\u6853\u516c\u5c07\u6b32\u5f81\u4f10\u7532\u5175\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee4\u6709\u91cd\u7f6a\u8005\u51fa\u7280\u7532\u4e00\u621f\u6709\u8f7b\u7f6a\u8005\u8d50\u4ee5\u91d1\u5206\u8bbc\u800c\u4e0d\u80dc\u8005\u51fa\u4e00\u675f\u7d20\u767e\u59d3\u7686\u8bf4\u4e43\u94f8\u7bad\u4e3a\u77e2\u94f8\u91d1\u800c\u4e3a\u5203\n\n\"Huan, Duke of Ts'i, wished to go to war, but his arms and accoutrements being insufficient, he commanded that for the graver crimes the offender should pay a cuirass of\nrhinoceros hide and a three-pointed spear; for the lighter crimes the culprit should redeem himself with a portion of metal [or perhaps gold]; while unsuccessful litigants should pay a sheaf of arrows. The people were pleased at this, and made arrows out of the chien-bamboo and cast metal into blades, \u9752.\u201d\n\nIt must be this passage which we find thus summarized in the Ku Ch\u2019\u00fcan Hui (Section Hsiang, ch. 2, p. 1), but with an important variation:\n\n\u201cHuai Nan Tz\u016d says that Duke Huan, fearing his arms were insufficient, commanded that for lighter crimes the culprit should redeem himself with a metal knife. Duke Huan thus became rich and powerful. Throughout the history of the State of Ts\u2019i, this was the traditional and unchanged coinage. As the natural result, specimens have been numerous up to the present day.\u201d\n\nIt will be seen that the characters \u91d1\u5206, chin f\u00ean, of Huai Nan Tz\u016d (I consulted the edition of Kao Yu, \u9ad8\u8aa6), have become \u91d1\u5200, chin tao, in the Ku Ch\u2019\u00fcan Hui. The variation in the two characters is easy to account for\u2014omit the upper part of f\u00ean and there remains tao. But which is right? For unless the text of Huai Nan Tz\u016d used both by the authors of the Ku Ch\u2019\u00fcan Hui and of the Chin Shih So is the authentic one, this version of the origin of the knife money must be abandoned.\n\nBut I am fortunate enough to have discovered, as I believe, the source whence Huai Nan Tz\u016d derived his information. That source is again Kuan Tz\u016d, in whose eighth chapter, on the first page, occur these words:\n\n\u516c\u66f0\u6c11\u8fa6\u8ecd\u4e8b\u77e3\u5247\u53ef\u4e4e\u5c0d\u66f0\u4e0d\u53ef\u7532\u5175\u672a\u8db3\u4e5f\u8acb\u8584\u5211\u7f70\u4ee5\u539a\u7532\u5175\u65bc\u662f\u6b7b\u7f6a\u4e0d\u6bba\u5211\u7f6a\u4e0d\u7f70\u4f7f\u4ee5\u7532\u5175\u8d16\u6b7b\u7f6a\u4ee5\u7280\u7532\u4e00\u621f\u5211\u7f6a\u4ee5\u9aa8\u76fe\u4e00\u621f\u904e\u7f6a\u4ee5\u91d1\u8ecd\u7121\u6240\u8a08\u800c\u8a1f\u8005\u6210\u4ee5\u675f\u77e2\n\n\u201cThe Duke said, \u2018Now that the people understand the business of campaigning, is it feasible?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 was the\nanswer, 'arms and accoutrements are insufficient. I would beg that you lighten the punishments, and thus add to your arms.' Thereupon death was no more inflicted for capital offences, nor their [respective] penalties for those of which maiming was the punishment, but the guilty were made to redeem themselves by the payment of arms and accoutrements. For capital offences a rhinoceros skin cuirass and one three-pointed spear; for offences punishable by maiming, a shield and three-pointed spear; for offences committed by misadventure, fines of metal [or perhaps gold] were inflicted. Where a charge was brought not included in the military code [so the commentator understands the words ch\u00fcn wu so chi], it was settled by the payment of a sheaf of arrows.\"\n\nIf this passage be authentic, it seems clearly to be the basis of Huai Nan Tz\u016d's version. The \"offences committed by misadventure\" answer to the \"lighter offences\" of the later author, and the single word \"metal,\" or perhaps \"gold,\" of Kuan Tz\u016d becomes in Huai Nan Tz\u016d \"a portion of metal\" (or of gold), which does not sensibly modify the meaning, and, if I may indulge in a little conjecture, a trifling accommodation of the latter text, a mere deletion of two insignificant strokes, so as to transform \u5206 into \u5200, or \"portion\" into \"knife,\" on the part, perhaps, of some one with a theory, and we have the origin of this story of how knife money came into existence in the State of Ts'i.\n\nBut another and more formidable difficulty in accepting the story is furnished by the knife-coins themselves. In no sense could they have been used as weapons. Even the biggest of them, the \"large knives of Ts'i\" are only large as compared with the feeble little objects known as \"knives of Ch\u00fc\" or \"Ming knives.\" What sort of a weapon is a thin bronze blade not longer than a razor, but which, unlike a razor, is constructed with an \"edge\" made by a raised rim or lip as if specially provided to prevent its cutting? Yet such is the make of one of these terrible weapons now lying before me. Whatever\nmay be the real origin of knife-coins, those that have come down to us are certainly not specimens of Duke Huan's ingeniously collected magazine of arms and accoutrements.\n\nTs'u tao, or Chin ts'u tao, \u9396\u5200 or \u91d1\u9396\u5200. Inlaid knife, or Gold-inlaid knife.\n\nAnother form of knife-coin, very similar to the ch'i tao, was introduced by Wang Mang, and is so named because, as Vissering says, \"the characters engraved on these coins, denoting the name and value, were washed with gold.\"\n\nYa sh\u00eang ch'ien, \u58d3\u52dd\u9322. Coins of Domination.\n\nThis phrase is found written with \u58d3 for the first word, but in either case the reading is ya and not yen. The meaning of the name is Money possessing magic powers of dominating or subjugating (ya sh\u00eang) evil influences.\n\nThe term is said in the Po Ku T'u to have been introduced by Li Hsiao-mei, one of the earlier writers on numismatics, and is applied to various descriptions of medals and other pieces, used as charms\u2014not true coins\u2014of which figures will be found in the coin-books. The subjoined translation of a passage from a work entitled the Ch'i Sh\u00eang Chi, or Record of the Seven Holy Ones, is quoted in ch. 43 of the Ku Y\u00fc T'u Pu, and shows the functions of these Coins of Domination.\n\n\"The Supreme Ruler of the Tao [?] Lao Tz\u00fb; \u592a\u4e0a\u9053\u541b in the text] on the 15th day of the seventh moon ascended to the Lin Hall of the Nine Heavens, where he expounded the Law to the multitude of Devas, and thus addressed them: 'In the Earth below, the people are much afflicted with floods, drought, and pestilence.' Then was the Honoured Ruler of the Exquisite Dawn charged to convey a precious casket in which were placed two miracle-working Dragon Coins of Domination, to be left to guard the famous mountains and great rivers, and to remove disastrous influences.\"\n\nPresumably these magic medals are of Taoist origin, but they are of little real importance to our subject. M. Lacouperie rightly remarks on p. xxxi. of the Introduction,\nthat \"they have no regular connection with the currency,\" but disfigures a note on the same page by a grotesque misrendering of the term as \"yen [sic] shing tsien, \u5ee2\u52dd\u9322, hardly-adequate-to-coins\"!\n\nY\u00fc chia ch'ien, or Chia ch'ien, \u6a9c\u83a2\u9322, or \u835a\u9322. Elm seed-vessel money.\n\nDiminutive specimens of cash were cast in large quantities in the early years of the Han dynasty, to which the above terms were applied, and fittingly applied, considering the size, shape, and tenuity of the well-known seed-vessel of the elm tree. It is matter for surprise that with the word \u835a, chia, a pod or seed-vessel, staring him in the face, Vissering should have gone out of his way to mistranslate the word as \"elm-leaf,\" as he does on p. 29, thereby converting a distinctly apt comparison into a quite inappropriate one. But that M. Lacouperie should have blindly followed him into this blunder is stranger still.\n\nYuan, \u5713. A round object, specially a round coin.\n\nModern usage restricts this, as a numerative, to officials, curiously enough, while for foreign coins \u5713 and \u5143 (both pronounced yu\u00e1n) are written.\n\nThe Shuo W\u00ean tersely defines the word as the \"numerative of objects.\" But the author of the Liu Shu Ku is more communicative, and writes as follows: \"Meaning: Money (\u9322). T'ai Kung first cast metal into circles, \u5713, to serve as a medium of exchange. They were round externally and square internally, hence the character consists of \u53e3 [wei, of which the ancient shape was a circle] and \u8c9d [pei, a shell]. They are now called ch'ien or cash. The numerative of shells is \u8c9d, p'\u00eang, of coins, \u5713, yu\u00e1n.\"\n\nThe Shuo W\u00ean and the Liu Shu Ku do not, we may note in passing, analyse the character in the same way. According to the former, wei, the upper part, is merely phonetic. In the preferable view of the Liu Shu Ku, the character is an example of hui i, \"suggestive compounds,\" in which the general idea of value indicated by \u8c9d is combined with the special distinction of circularity, \u53e3, to\nsuggest the word, and make up the character, \u5713, yu\u00e1n, a round coin.\n\nIt should also be noticed that in the Liu Shu Ku the term yu\u00e1n fa is always written \u5713\u6cd5, and not, as ordinarily,\n\nThe yu\u00e1n, it will thus be seen, are what we now call cash, and so the same with the yu\u00e1n fa of T'ai Kung. We are not warranted, I think, in identifying either the thing or the word with \u9322, huan, a metal ring, as M. Lacouperie has done on p. xvii.\n\nThe character itself is actually found on the coins inscribed pan yu\u00e1n, \u534a\u5713, figured on pp. 320, 321 of the \"Catalogue,\" and attributed by the author of the Ku Ch'\u00fcan Hui to the epoch of the Contending States.\n\nLi Tso-hsien, in his notes on these coins, explains that \u5713 is interchangeable with \u5713, while the latter was anciently written \u5713, so that these three characters are convertible, and he interprets the inscription as meaning that the coin was equal in value to half a yu\u00e1n fa.\n\nYu\u00e1n fa, \u5713\u6cd5. Currency, coinage, especially, perhaps exclusively, the coinage or coins of copper cash.\n\nThis term has been a stumbling-block to Vissering and M. Lacouperie. The former, p. 17, says that the term means \"Round or current Rule.\" The latter, p. xix. of the Introduction, writes, \"Yuan-fah, current rule, or better, rules of currency.\" Both have misconceived the force of the syllable fa. This does not here have reference to law or rule, but illustrates a very common usage of the word, namely method, system. In the modern colloquial language, to quote from Mateer's excellent \"Mandarin Lessons,\" p. 282, \"\u6cd5 is much used as an affix to verbs, to denote the manner of the action. It is sometimes also joined to nouns, which it practically turns into verbs; thus \u5175\u6cd5 means drill, but must be analysed as the method of drilling soldiers, or of soldiering. In all cases \u6cd5 is without accent...\"\n\nThus, at the present day, \u9322\u6cd5, ch'ien fa, is the ordinary term for the copper coinage, the currency, and means\nliterally the coin-system or coin-method. So \u9214\u6cd5 occurs for the Chinese paper currency or note-system. And in the same way, precisely, the old term \u5143\u6cd5 was used. According as we consider \u5143 to mean \"round\" with some, or with \u8ca8 to signify \"uniform and current\" (\u5747\u800c\u901a)\u2014according, in fact, as we translate it \"circular\" or \"circulating\"\u2014the full term will mean the system or method of round coins (\u5143); or the system of circulating currency: introduced, in either case, as tradition constantly declared, by T'ai Kung when Minister to the sovereign of Chou. By a natural transition the coins themselves came to be spoken of by the same name, \u5143\u6cd5 thus becoming synonymous with \u91d1\u9322. In numismatic works \u5143\u6cd5 is used to distinguish the round cash from the knife- or pu-coins.\n\nIf the first analysis of the term be chosen, a word \u5713, \u5143, meaning a round coin, is logically implied. With that special meaning and in that special written form, I have not met it, though the character constantly occurs in the Shuo Wen's text, meaning round, circular, in general. But as shown under the previous entry, we have a pan \u5143 coin, while the Liu Shu Ku expressly affirms that the synonymous character \u91d1 means money, \u91d1\u9322, and that T'ai Kung first cast money in the form of circles, \u4e00\u54e1, \u5143. Elsewhere the same work quotes a remark that when \u91d1\u9322 came into use as the word for money, the earlier names \u91d1\u9322 and \u5143, \u91d1, became obsolete.\n\nWe do seem, therefore, to find traces of such a word as we are in quest of, and Tai T'ung in writing \u91d1\u6cd5 for the term \u5143\u6cd5 is perhaps historically justified.\n\n\u5143\u5bf6. (1) A name first applied to cash in the opening reign of the T'ang dynasty. (2) A \"shoe\" of silver or silver bullion.\n\nIt does not seem certain which of these senses is the earlier, nor, supposing it to be the second, what the true significance of the name is. We might, perhaps, conjecture the meaning to be silver of \"prime (\u5143, \u5143) value,\" i.e. of the highest purity. A writer named Weng Shu-p'ei,\nthe author of a book on coins, and evidently much esteemed by his fellow-author of the Ku Ch'\u00fcan Hui, is quoted in the latter work (Section Shou Chi, ch. 4) on this point. He says:\n\n\"The words t'ung pao (\u901a\u5b9d), or 'current valuable,' on coins derive their meaning from the currency (\u6d41\u901a) of the latter. But in the term y\u00fcan pao the word y\u00fcan has no derivation. It is nothing but a traditional phrase dating from the K'ai t'ung money [viz. the cash cast about A.D. 622, in the 4th year of Wu T\u00ea]. At that time y\u00fcan pao was a name for a wealthy man. Under the Y\u00fcan dynasty, in the reign Chung T'ung, y\u00fcan pao was a term for a banknote, and subsequently the same expression was applied to silver ingots.\"\n\nW\u00e9ng's opinion evidently was that there first existed a phrase associated with wealth, but the origin of which is obscure, and that under the circumstances, to be immediately explained, this phrase became, by a popular error, a name for the new copper cash, later for banknotes also, and lastly for silver bullion.\n\nThe origin of the term as applied to cash is curious. I do not know if it has been given before, but Vissering, who devotes some three pages to the K'ai y\u00fcan cash (pp. 100-102), does not allude to it.\n\nIt is thus narrated in the History of the Earlier Tang dynasty, as cited in the Chin Shih So. After stating that in the fourth year of the Wu T\u00ea period, A.D. 622, the 5-shu currency of the preceding Sui dynasty was abandoned, and a new type of coins introduced, bearing the legend K'ai y\u00fcan t'ung pao, \u958b\u5143\u901a\u5bf6, or \"current money of the inauguration,\" various details are added, and the passage goes on\u2014\"The inscription commenced at the top, continued at the bottom, was resumed at the left hand, and ended on the right.\" If the legend were read round the coin,\n\n1 As Vissering correctly points out, p. 102, note 2, the usage of these terms with respect to coins is exactly the reverse of ours, though it conforms to European heraldic practice. The \"left\" of a coin, as Chinese call it, is our \"right.\" However, the practice must have varied, for \"right\" and \"left\" in the Ku Ch'\u00fcan Hui are the same as with us. Is this an archaism?\nbeginning at the top and going on to the left [our right], it also made sense, and so the common custom was to speak of K'ai t'ung y\u00fcan pao money.\" The same authority relates that for a short time in the subsequent reign of Ch'ien F\u00eang, A.D. 666-668, the legend was actually inscribed in conformity with the prevailing popular practice, but almost immediately reverted to the standard disposition of the characters, which usually obtained afterwards.\n\nAlthough the adoption of y\u00fcan pao as a numismatic term was thus due to a popular freak, we are justified in supposing that the expression already existed, and most likely as the Ku Ch'\u00fcan Hui asserts, with such a sense that its association with coins would not seem inappropriate. The words k'ai t'ung are still used to denote the idea of opening, commencing, initiating.\n\nThe point is not strictly germane to the early history of money, but it may not be altogether out of place, in connection with this term, to notice the singular errors into which M. Lacouperie has fallen in the following passage on p. xxv. of the Introduction:\n\n\"Sycee, Chinese \u7d30\u7d72, fine silk, is the general term for lump silver, and is explained as meaning that, if pure, it may be drawn out under the application of heat into fine silk-like threads. This is, of course, a script-etymology, and pure fancy, derived from the ideographical meaning inherent in the symbols, while the historical etymology must be sought for in a foreign term transliterated thereby. Yuen-pao, \u5143\u5bf6, is the common name among foreigners for the silver ingot which bears some resemblance to a native shoe.\"\n\nThus M. Lacouperie. Now for some facts. The statement as to sycee M. Lacouperie cites from Mr. Giles' \"Glossary of Reference,\" and, as we have seen, he takes exception to the explanation of the term there given. That explanation, though usual, is not, I believe, in fact the correct one, as the subjoined translation of a note on the subject by a Chinese formerly in the Banking business shows, while it also disposes of M. Lacouperie's supposed \"foreign term transliterated\" by the characters.\n\"The term *sycee* (fine silk) originated in the Five Northern Provinces [Chihli, Shantung, Shansi, Shensi, and Honan]. When the Shansi Bankers melt silver into ingots, after it has been liquefied and poured into the mould, and before it has again solidified, the mould is lightly tapped, when there appear on the surface of the silver fine, silk-like, circular lines. The higher the 'touch' of the metal, the more like fine silk are these 'circlings' on the surface of the silver. Hence ingots of full quality are classified as *sycee*.\"\n\nIt merely remains to add that the pronunciation of the two characters as 'sycee,' represents the Cantonese and not the northern sounds, due, no doubt, to the fact that the Europeans who first introduced this word heard it from the lips of their Cantonese Compradores, who adopted it from the Shansi Bankers\u2014for it does not appear to be a Cantonese phrase at all\u2014giving the characters their Cantonese values.\n\nI was much mystified by M. Lacouperie's perversely incorrect statement that \"Yuen pao is the common name among foreigners for the silver ingot which bears some resemblance to the native shoe,\" when any resident of six months' standing in China could have informed him that the term *yuan pao* is never used by foreigners. The explanation is simple. M. Lacouperie has taken this sentence from Mr. Giles' \"Glossary of Reference,\" p. 128, omitting the initial words \"Shoes (of Silver): \u5143\u5bf6.\" It is, of course, the \"shoe\" which is \"the common term among foreigners,\" and not *yuan pao*.\n\n[It should be noted that this article was received some time before the lamented death of Mr. Lacouperie. The writer, having in the meantime returned to China, could not easily be consulted as to any alterations he would, under the circumstances, have wished to make in it; so it has been thought best to print the article without material change.\u2014Ed.]\nART. X.\u2014An unpublished Valabhi Copper-plate Inscription of King Dhruvasena I. By Dr. Th. Bloch.\n\nThe two copper-plates from which the subjoined transcript has been made were entrusted by Dr. Burgess to Professor B\u00fchler for publication, and he has kindly allowed me to edit them. They are now in the British Museum.\n\nThey contain a Sanskrit inscription of King Dhruvasena I. of Valabhi, dated (Gupta) Samvat 217 (536\u201337 A.D.), \u0100\u015bvayuja, ba. 13.\n\nThe plates are by no means in good preservation. Both in the upper margin and low down in the left-hand corner of the first some pieces are broken off, and the right-hand side of the second plate is in a similar condition, so that in the beginning of the inscription the name of the place from which the edict was issued has been totally destroyed; and, further, through the destructive influence of time, parts of many letters have been lost, leaving only a few, and in some cases almost unreadable traces of them. Nevertheless, it has been possible, by the help of similar inscriptions, to make out the majority of the words, and only a few have remained uncertain, amongst them, unfortunately, being the name of the village granted by the king.\n\nThe language of the inscription is Sanskrit. It is written in prose, with the exception of the two \u015blokas from the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, quoted as usual at the end, to indicate the blessings that follow land-granting, and the curses that will fall on those who steal land.\n\nConcerning orthography or grammar there is nothing particular to notice except, perhaps, some of the usual clerical errors to be found in these plates, e.g. Bhatakkah instead of Bhata\u1e5bkkah (line 3); cf. another grant of Dhruvasena I. (Ind. Ant. v. 205, plate i. l. 4), and Seal\nof Maliya Copper-plate Inscription of Dharasena II. (Corpus Inscr. Ind. vol. iii. p. 164), r\u0101ja-sr\u012bh instead of r\u0101jya-sr\u012bh (l. 8); cf. another grant of Dhruvasena I. (Ind. Ant. iv. 104, plate i. l. 9), and the spelling t\u0101nyeva instead of t\u0101ny-eva (l. 27), etc.\n\nThe inscription is in the usual form; after enumerating the well-known vams\u0101vali, beginning with the founder of the dynasty, sr\u012b-sen\u0101pati-Bha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101rakkah, up to King Dhruvasena I., it records the grant made by the king, strictly prohibiting any future alteration of it, and concludes with the subscription of the king\u2019s name and titles, the date and names of the d\u016btaka, Bhatti, and the writer, Kikkaka.\n\nTo give a translation, therefore, of the whole inscription would be a mere waste of time, and I think a few remarks will quite suffice to assign to the inscription its true place in the rank of similar historical documents. Concerning its age, it may be noticed that though the date (Gupta Samvat 217; 536\u201337 A.D.) does not precede the date of one other inscription published by Professor B\u00fchler, Ind. Ant. v. 205, viz. Gupta Samvat 207, which still remains the first recorded date of King Dhruvasena I., nevertheless it is one of the oldest Valabhi Inscriptions which have come under our notice.\n\nIts main object is to record a grant made by King Dhruvasena I., who calls himself by his usual titles\u2014the great chamberlain, the great general, the great k\u0101rttak\u1e5btika, and the great feudatory prince (l. 11), to the congregation of monks residing in the vih\u0101ra, founded by the king\u2019s sister, Dud\u1e0d\u0101 (l. 17), and in another, founded by the teacher, the venerable Buddhad\u0101sa (l. 18, \u0101c\u0101ryya-bhadanta-Buddhad\u0101sa). The grant consisted of a village, named, perhaps, Va\u1e6daprajyaka (?), which I have been unable to identify, described as situated in the neighbourhood of a district or village, the name of which is illegible, a few, most uncertain letters, alone remaining (l. 14). Of the two monasteries mentioned in our inscriptions, the first is well known from other inscriptions of the same king and his successors (e.g. Ind. Ant. iv. 175; ibid. 106; v. 63), and\nvery often was favoured with land-grants by them. The second is a new one, and, as far as I know, has not hitherto been found in any other inscription. Probably it was one of the some hundred sa\u1e45gh\u0101r\u0101mas, of which Hiuen Tsiang gives us a short account in his Si-yu-ki (translated by Beal, ii. 266), quoting by name only one great sa\u1e45gh\u0101rama, not far from the city which was built by the Arhat \u0100c\u0101ra ('O-che-lo), identified by Prof. B\u00fchler with the monastery of \u0100tharya, mentioned in a grant of King Dharasena II. (Ind. Ant. vi. 9), and to which certainly also belonged the other monasteries at Valabh\u012b, whose names are found here and there in similar inscriptions.\n\nHowever, this very fact that King Dhruvasena, himself a worshipper of \u015aiva and descendant of a \u015aivaitic family, is again seen in this inscription making a grant to Buddhist monks, is of no small interest, as it confirms one of the few historical accounts concerning these feudatory kings of Valabh\u012b, exhibited to us by their epigraphical documents, viz. the fact that though themselves devoted to \u015aiva-worship, they were great protectors of the Bauddhas who lived in their country. And it may be said that the inscription forms an important link in the chain of historical records, and that together with kindred facts, viz. that Dudd\u0101, the sister of several \u015aivaitic kings or princes, was a follower of the Buddhist faith (paramop\u0101sik\u0101: Ind. Ant. iv. 105 f., plate ii. l. 5), and a founder of a Buddhist monastery; that, perhaps, Bha\u1e6d\u0101rkka, the founder of the dynasty, had already built a similar one (Ind. Ant. vi. 9), and that later on the illustrious King Guhasena, who formerly calls himself devoted to \u015aiva (paramam\u0101he\u015bvara: Ind. Ant. iv. 174) is suddenly called \"the ardent devotee of Buddha\" (paramop\u0101saka: Ind. Ant. v. 206), from which it appears that this ruler was actually converted to Buddhism; it confirms in the first place the wide extent of Buddhism in this country during the sixth and seventh centuries A.D., and in the second exhibits an example of religious tolerance among medi\u00e6val kings, not unworthy indeed of the two great emperors A\u015boka and Akbar.\nFirst Plate.\n\n(1) Om [||*] Svasti [||*] Vijaya-Skandha[v\u0101r\u0101t . . . . . . v\u0101sa-k\u0101]t=Pra[sabha]-pra[na]t[-\u0101mi]tr[\u0101n\u0101m]M[ai]-trak\u0101n\u0101m=atula-bala-sa[m]panna-ma[n]da[l-\u0101]-\n\n(2) bhoga - samsakta - samprah\u0101ra - \u015bata-[labdha - prat\u0101pa]\u1e25 prat\u0101p - opanata-d\u0101na-m\u0101n-\u0101rjjav-op\u0101rijit-\u0101nurag-\u0101nurakta-maulabh\u1e5bta-\n\n(3) mit[t]ra \u00b9-\u015bre\u1e47i-bal-\u0101v\u0101pta-r\u0101jya-\u015br\u012b\u1e25 parama-m\u0101he\u015bvara\u015b=\u015br\u012b-sen\u0101pati-BHAT\u0100KKAH \u00b2 [||*] Tasya sutas=tac-carana-rajo-run-\u0101vanata-\n\n(4) [pav]i[tri]-k\u1e5bta-\u015bir\u0101\u015b=\u015biro-vanata-\u015bat[t]ru \u00b3-c\u016b\u1e0d\u0101ma\u1e47i-prabh\u0101-vicchurita-p\u0101da-nakha-pa\u00f1kti-d\u012bdhiti\u1e25 din\u0101n\u0101tha-jan-opa-\n\n(5) [jivya]m\u0101na-vibhava\u1e25 parama-m\u0101he\u015bvarah \u015br\u012b-sen\u0101pati-DHARASENAH [||*] Tasy=\u0101nujas=tat-p\u0101d-\u0101bhipra\u1e47\u0101ma-pra\u015basta\u2074-\n\n(6) [vi]mala - mauli - ma\u1e47ir=Mmanv - \u0101di - pra\u1e47\u012bta - vidhi -vidh\u0101na-dharmm\u0101 Dharmmar\u0101ja iva vihita-vinaya-vyavasth\u0101-paddha-\n\n(7) tir=akhila-bhuvana-man\u1e0dal-\u0101bhog-aika-sv\u0101min\u0101 parama-sv\u0101min\u0101 svayam-upahita-r\u0101jy-\u0101bhi\u1e63eka-mah\u0101-\n\n(8) [vi]\u015br\u0101\u1e47an-\u0101vap\u016bta-r\u0101ja\u2075-\u015br\u012b\u1e25 parama-m\u0101he\u015bvara\u015b=\u015br\u012b-mah\u0101r\u0101ja-DRONASIMHAS=simhaiva[||*] Tasy=\u0101nujas=sva-bhu-\n\n(9) ja-bala-par\u0101kkrame\u1e47a para-gaja-gha\u1e6d-\u0101nik\u0101n\u0101m=eka-vijay\u012b \u015bara\u1e47-aisi\u1e47\u0101m \u015bara\u1e47\u0101m=avaboddh\u0101\n\n(10) [\u015b\u0101str-\u0101]rttha-tatv\u0101n\u0101m\u2076 kalpatarur=iva suh\u1e5bt-pra\u1e47ayin\u0101m yath\u0101-bhila\u1e63ita-k\u0101ma-phal-opabhoga-dah\n\n(11) [parama-bha]tt\u0101raka-p\u0101d-\u0101nuddhy\u0101to mah\u0101pratih\u0101ra-mah\u0101da\u1e47\u1e0dan\u0101yaka-mah\u0101k\u0101rtt\u0101k\u1e5btika-mah\u0101s\u0101mant\u0101-\n\n\u00b9 Doubtful, whether spelt with one or two t's.\n\u00b2 Read Bhaj\u0101rk\u0101\u1e25.\n\u00b3 It doubtful.\n\u2074 The usual reading is pra\u015bastatara; tara is wanting also, Ind.

XI.\u2014The History of Kilwa. Edited from an Arabic MS. by S. Arthur Strong.\n\nIt would seem at first sight as if the history of a small African island were hardly worth the trouble of editing in its original and not very stylish Arabic dress. But it was a saying of Scaliger's that *omnis historia bona*, and no people seem to have realized the truth of this more than the Arabs. An event once recorded simply as and because it happened, may by the advance of time be brought into new clearness and significance. Once in possession of the fact we can agree upon the fiction at our leisure. And from this point of view we have every reason to be grateful that the influence of Islam tended to narrative rather than criticism, to veracity rather than profundity. In the present instance we have a record, scanty indeed and prosaic, but one to which in the excitement of the scramble for Africa we can hardly be indifferent. It is true that the author, after a fashion not uncommon in the East, conducts us to the crisis and turning-point of his story, and then suddenly relapses into silence, but not before we have seen and recognized \"the intruder on his ancient home.\" The arrival of Vasco da Gama opens a new chapter of history, of which, with its complications and surprises, we have not yet come to the end.\n\nThe present edition is based upon a MS. believed to be unique, numbered Or. 2666 in the collection of the British Museum. The MS. was presented to the nation by Sir John Kirk, who himself received it as a gift from Barghash\nb. Sa'id, Sultan of Zanzibar.

The writing is neat and clear, but it is obvious that the scribe was more expert in penmanship than in philology. The author, though, as we shall see, he mentions the date of his birth, modestly suppresses his name, nevertheless in a MS. note on one of the blank leaves of the book, Sir John Kirk has preserved what was doubtless the local tradition, as follows: \"Notes on the History of Kilwa, by Sheikh Moheddin of Zanzibar, 1862\" (Rieu, Catalogue, Suppl., p. 391). However, it seems not improbable that the text, as we have it, is a modern compilation from some ancient record closely resembling, if not actually identical with, the Chronica dos Reys de Quiloa, found by the Portuguese (De Barros, \"Asia,\" i., viii. 6). In that case Moheddin would not be the author, but the compiler, who either did not know, or for some reason suppressed, the real author's name. 'The Kazi Muhhiyy el Din,' honourably mentioned by Burton for his proficiency in Arabic (\"Zanzibar,\" i. p. 423), is doubtless the same as our Moheddin; but the grammatical inaccuracies with which the text abounds, if they are not entirely the fault of the scribe, point to not more than a provincial level of attainment in the compiler.\n\nAfter the usual pious invocations the author describes how he undertook the work at the request of the Sultan, whose name we shall learn later on. He tells us that he devoted special pains to the elaboration and adornment of the style, which, left to ourselves, we should hardly have guessed from the baldness and occasional clumsiness of the narrative as we have it. He divided the work into\na preface and ten chapters. From the nature of this preface it would seem that his conception of history resembles that of the late M. Taine, at least to this extent that, before entering upon his narrative, he is careful to lay a philosophical groundwork in the shape of a discussion of understanding and its rules of discipline. Understanding was God's first creation and His best. It has two forms or phases, of which one is susceptible of increase and decrease, while the other is not. There are certain features of character and conduct which point straight to the perfection of a man's understanding; others have no such value as evidence. It sometimes happens that a pretender to understanding is placed in a position, in which he can no longer hide the real meagreness of his resources. Such an impostor was Ab\u016b 'l-Q\u0101sim 'Abd al-'Az\u012bz; and the story of his exposure and consequent expulsion from the place where he had duped his fellow-citizens is related in full.\n\nThe author now turns to the main business of his narrative, and, in the first chapter, describes the founding of Kilwa by Persian immigrants from Sh\u012br\u0101z. The story goes that there was a Sultan of Sh\u012br\u0101z named \u1e24asan b. 'Al\u012b. This Sultan had six sons, and one day he saw a vision of a rat with an iron snout nibbling and gnawing at the walls. From this he foreboded the ruin of the country, and so, his first thought being naturally of his own safety, he determined to make good his escape while there was yet time. He communicated the vision to his sons, who agreed with him as to its meaning and moral; but they urged the difficulty of inducing the amirs, the wazirs, and the other notables to consent to their departure. However, this difficulty was eventually solved by a stratagem of the Sultan's devising, and the whole family, seven in number, sailed away from the doomed country in as many ships. Of these it was the sixth that came to Kilwa. At the time of the immigration Kilwa was an island only at high tide, for the water, as it subsided, uncovered a neck of land which it was easy to traverse on foot. The new-comers\nfound a Muslim already settled there with his family, and a mosque. From him they learned that the country belonged to the chief of the neighbouring district of Almuli, who was then absent on a hunting expedition. After a few days he returned to Kilwa, and the stranger, being pleased with the island, offered, through the mediation of the friendly Muslim, to buy it. The chief named his terms, which were that the stranger should surround the whole island with coloured cloth. This was soon done, and the chief took the cloth and surrendered the island. All the while, however, he cherished the secret intention of returning with an armed force to destroy the immigrants and carry off their goods. This was guessed by the Muslim, who had acted as interpreter, so he warned the strangers to provide for their safety in time. Accordingly, as soon as the chief's back was turned, they set to work and dug a trench in the neck of land joining Kilwa to the continent. After a short time the chief reappeared at the usual spot, and waited for the tide to go down and leave a dry passage to Kilwa; but the water never subsided, so he returned to his own country defeated and disappointed. And this is how Kilwa came to be, what it now is, an island.\n\nThe author then proceeds to enumerate the early sovereigns of Kilwa. The first was 'Ali b. al-Husayn b. 'Ali, called Ighawumij. He reigned in the middle of the ninth century of our era, and established his son, Muhammad b. 'Ali, as ruler of a neighbouring island called in our text sometimes \u0645\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0635\u064f\u0648\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0629, and sometimes \u0645\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0635\u064f\u0648\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0629. After a reign of two years and a half Muhammad died, and was succeeded by his brother Bashat b. 'Ali. 'Ali himself, that is the Persian immigrant, reigned over Kilwa for forty years, and was succeeded at his death by another 'Ali, son of Bashat.\n\nThe second chapter describes the political changes produced at Kilwa by the repeated incursions and encroachments of a tribe called \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064f\u0647\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f\u0650\u064a\u064f\u0651\u0648\u0646\u064e. These people ravaged the country, overthrew the government, and set up a chief of\ntheir own race, named \u1e24\u0101lid b. Bakr. But after a reign of only two years and a half \u1e24\u0101lid was expelled by the people of Kilwa, and the government then passed into the hands of \u1e24asan b. Sulaym\u0101n b. \u2018Al\u012b, a grandson of the first founder of the colony. However, he had not been long in possession before the enemy overran Kilwa a second time. \u1e24asan fled to Zanzibar, and his place and power were given to an Am\u012br named Mu\u1e25ammad b. al-\u1e24usayn al-Mundhiri. But the people of Kilwa combined once more to overthrow the government of the stranger, and under the leadership of the son of the exiled Sultan they went to the house of the Am\u012br, and imprisoned him there. Then they sent a deputation to Zanzibar to bring back the Sultan. Meanwhile the Am\u012br, who had managed to escape, hurried to the sea-shore to encounter the Sultan and oppose his landing, but he was slain by the followers of \u1e24asan, who thus returned in triumph to his kingdom. His reign lasted for fourteen years, and his successor was \u1e24asan b. D\u0101\u016bd b. \u2018Al\u012b.\n\nIn course of time the supremacy passed from the house of \u2018Al\u012b to that of Ab\u016b \u2019l-Maw\u0101hib, whose career is described in the third chapter. He succeeded his grandfather \u1e24asan b. \u1e6c\u0101l\u016bt, who had taken the sovereignty by force, and kept it for eighteen years. In his youth Ab\u016b \u2019l-Maw\u0101hib journeyed to Aden and Mecca, and acquired great proficiency in sacred science. The author now introduces the mother of Ab\u016b \u2019l-Maw\u0101hib, but in an episode the abruptness and irrelevance of which show plainly that, though the MS. runs on without a break, something must have been left out by the scribe. But this, at least, seems to be clear, that Ab\u016b \u2019l-Maw\u0101hi bowed his position to the voluntary renunciation by his brother D\u0101\u016bd of his right or his claim to the kingdom. The first act of Ab\u016b \u2019l-Maw\u0101hib, as soon as he felt that his power was secure, was to avenge his father\u00b9 by chastising the people of \u1e34\u0101s\u016b. He ravaged their country, and\n\n\u00b9 Here again the author is alluding to a fact not otherwise described or explained.\nsubjected it to his rule. But at this point our author's besetting fear of prolixity comes upon him, so we are told nothing more about Ab\u016b 'l-Maw\u0101hib, except the length of his reign and the fact that in his time the mosque at Kilwa had fallen into such a state of decay that the people were obliged to worship in tents. Ab\u016b 'l-Maw\u0101hib had reigned fourteen years when he died, and was succeeded by his brother D\u0101\u016bd. This king was noted for piety; nevertheless, when his reign was still measured only by days, he was dethroned and replaced by \u1e24usayn b. Sulaym\u0101n al-Ma\u1e6d\u02bf\u016bn. \u1e24usayn died a martyr in the holy war against the infidels of Almuli, and was succeeded by T\u0101l\u016bt b. al-\u1e24usayn, who was presumably his son. T\u0101l\u016bt started on a pilgrimage to Mecca, but died before reaching \u1e62e\u1e63\u1e6du, and his son \u1e24usayn b. Sulaym\u0101n, who had acted as viceroy in his absence, became king. \u1e24usayn himself afterwards accomplished the pilgrimage, and, with better luck than his father, returned safe and sound.\n\nThe fourth chapter opens with a brief account of the reign of Almalik al-'\u0100dil. His real name was Mu\u1e25ammad b. Sulaym\u0101n b. al-\u1e24usayn, and from his original post of governor he was raised to supreme power by the will of the nobles and the people. At his death, after a reign of two-and-twenty years, he seems to have been succeeded by his son Sulaym\u0101n. It was in the reign of this Sultan that the mosque was rebuilt, which, in the time of Ab\u016b 'l-Maw\u0101hib, we saw in a state of decay. A son of the Sultan \u1e24usayn, named \u1e24\u0101jj R\u016bsh, asked permission of Sulaym\u0101n to rebuild the mosque, and Sulaym\u0101n, while he granted permission, insisted upon defraying the cost himself with a gift of a thousand pieces of gold. \u1e24\u0101jj R\u016bsh objected to the condition, but, feeling that if he refused the gift he would lose the grace, he outwardly complied and took the money; nevertheless, he built the mosque entirely out of his own resources, and when Sulaym\u0101n died, he was careful to return the thousand pieces to his heirs. The work, however, could not be completed without divine assistance. The original columns of the mosque had been\nof planed stone, but the workmen were incapable of restoring them, so the new columns had to be made of wood, and the difficulty of procuring it of the right size had almost brought the work to a standstill, when the providence of God guided the people to the discovery of some wood that in size and quality was exactly suitable. And against such as might be inclined to doubt the miracle the author appeals to the credible eye-witness of two persons, one of whom was the Sultan Mu\u1e25ammad, by whose order this book was written. At the death of Sulaym\u0101n, Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl b. \u1e24usayn b. Sulaym\u0101n was chosen to succeed him, and he reigned thirteen years. About this time there appeared a pretender to the throne in the person of Sa\u02bfid, son of the Sultan \u1e24asan. He went to Zanzibar, and begged the Sultan there, namely \u1e24asan, son of Ab\u016b Bakr, to aid him in his designs upon Kilwa. The Sultan consented, and accordingly Sa\u02bfid and an Am\u012br of Zanzibar, named Zubayr, started for Kilwa at the head of an armed force. However, news of their approach reached Kilwa, and the threatening coalition was dissolved by means of a bribe, judiciously administered to Zubayr, by Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u2019s Am\u012br Mu\u1e25ammad. Sa\u02bfid himself reached Kilwa, with only four attendants, to learn that a reward had been offered by Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl to anyone who should bring his head. At first he went in disguise to the house of the Q\u0101\u1e0d\u012b, but finding himself recognized, he fled, and his goods were then seized by order of the Sultan. Eventually the tide of popular feeling seems to have turned in his favour. \u1e24asan, son of the Sultan Sulaym\u0101n, sought him out, and presented him to Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl, by whom he was pardoned. Nevertheless, he thought it prudent to live disguised and in retirement until the Sultan Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl was dead. After the death of the Sultan, the Waz\u012br Sulaym\u0101n and the Am\u012br Mu\u1e25ammad debated the matter of the succession, and privately agreed that it ought to fall to one or the other of them; so the Waz\u012br, when he saw that popular feeling was on the side of the Am\u012br, withdrew in his favour, and the Am\u012br Mu\u1e25ammad made himself Sultan. On the death of the Waz\u012br Sulaym\u0101n,\nwhich occurred only a few days before his own, Mu\u1e25ammad appointed Sa\u02bfid to the vacant post.\n\nIn the fifth chapter we learn that the Sultan Mu\u1e25ammad was succeeded by A\u1e25mad b. Sulaym\u0101n, who, after a reign of a single year, was succeeded in his turn by \u1e24asan b. Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl. Then follows the long episode of the coming of Mas\u02bf\u016bd to Kilwa, which happened in the reign of the Sultan Sa\u02bfid. Al-Malik Mas\u02bf\u016bd was the son of al-Malik al-Mu\u02bfayyad al-Ghass\u0101ni, Sultan of Aden, and he had been driven out of Aden by the Sultan \u2018Al\u012b b. T\u0101hir. This \u2018Al\u012b b. T\u0101hir had formerly himself been compelled to quit his native place, Jab\u0101n, in order to escape the tyranny and cruelty of Mas\u02bf\u016bd\u2019s father al-Mu\u02bfayyad. He then went as a pilgrim to Mecca, accompanied by another exile from the same cause, namely the Sharif \u2018Al\u012b b. Sufy\u0101n. From Mecca they continued their journey to Medina, and here it was that \u2018Al\u012b had a dream, in which he seemed to hear the prophet say to him: \u201cRise, \u2018Al\u012b, and take Yaman!\u201d He dreamed the same thing three times, and though his companion had had no such visitation, they yet could not agree as to its meaning, each thinking that the other \u2018Al\u012b was intended. But the upshot of it all was that they determined to set out for Yaman, after vowing that whoever should prove by the event to be the elect of God would make the other his waz\u012br. When they reached Yaman they found Mu\u02bfayyad dead, and the kingdom in possession of his son Mas\u02bf\u016bd, who was then at Aden. On the approach of \u2018Al\u012b and his companion the people of Aden deposed Mas\u02bf\u016bd and elected \u2018Al\u012b in his stead, and the latter immediately despatched his brother \u2018\u0100mir b. T\u0101hir with a numerous force to Aden. Whereupon Mas\u02bf\u016bd closed the gates of the town, and retired to a fortress in the open country, intending to carry on the war against \u2018\u0100mir from thence; but the arrival at the fortress of a messenger from \u2018\u0100mir was enough to induce the garrison to imitate the treachery of their brethren at Aden. However, it was not until \u2018\u0100mir was actually introduced into the castle of At Ta\u02bfakkur, by a\nstratagem of the governor, and the people of the place openly declared for him and his brother, that Mas\u02bf\u016bd abandoned the struggle and fled from the country. He went first to Zayla\u02bf, but, hearing that Sa\u02bfid was Sultan at Kilwa, he determined to visit him, and renew, if possible, the friendship that had sprung up between them at Aden, when Sa\u02bfid and his father, \u1e24asan b. Sulaym\u0101n, were pilgrims together. On his arrival at Kilwa he was graciously received by the Sultan, who loaded him with presents and favours; but when, on a subsequent occasion, and under the r\u00e9gime of a different Sultan, Sulaym\u0101n b. Mu\u1e25ammad, he repeated his visit, he found that other times had brought other manners. \u201cWe ask you,\u201d said the magnates of Kilwa, \u201cnot to come to us a second time, for the country has declined, and the folk are enfeebled; so do not come here to disgrace both us and yourself.\u201d Thereupon Mas\u02bf\u016bd retired to India, and dwelt there. As for \u2018Ali b. T\u0101hir, he gained possession of the whole of Yaman, and ruled in the spirit of the strictest orthodoxy. Moreover, he kept the promise which he had made to \u2018Ali b. Sufy\u0101n. The death of the Sultan Sa\u02bfid seems to have thrown the whole kingdom into confusion. The Amir Sulaym\u0101n seized the government for himself, and advanced his brother Mu\u1e25ammad to the dignity of Amir. He reigned for a year-and-a-half, and his successors were \u2018Abd Allah and \u2018Al\u012b, the two sons of \u1e24asan, the preacher.\n\nIn the sixth chapter we come to a break in the succession of Sultans, properly so called. The real power has fallen into the hands of the Amir Mu\u1e25ammad Kiw\u0101bi, who appoints and deposes puppets of his own choosing. On the death of \u2018Al\u012b, the preacher\u2019s son, Mu\u1e25ammad set up the Wazir \u1e24asan b. Sulaym\u0101n; but after a reign of six years he deposed him in favour of the Sultan Sab\u1e25at b. al-Malik al-\u02bf\u0100dil. At the end of a year Sab\u1e25at died, and Mu\u1e25ammad once more raised \u1e24asan to the chief place if not to the chief power. During his reign it happened that there was a disturbance among the people, and several of the citizens\u2014including Sab\u1e25at, the preacher, and the inspector\nof weights and measures (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0627\u0633\u0628\u0629)\u2014quitted the country and went on a pilgrimage to Mecca. When the time to depart came, they prayed God to further their return to their own country, if it should be for good; but if not, they resigned themselves to the will of God. The prayer was answered, but in a way that showed the difference between the proposal of man and the disposal of God; for of the six pilgrims, one died at Mecca, others at different points on the homeward route, and only two survived to reach Kilwa. It was about this time that Mu\u1e25ammad again deposed Hasan, and appointed the Sultan Ibr\u0101h\u012bm b. al-Malik al-\u02bf\u0100dil in his stead. Ibr\u0101h\u012bm kept his place for as many as five years; but in the course of his reign Hasan made an attempt to win back the power which he had twice enjoyed at the good pleasure of Mu\u1e25ammad. This, however, Mu\u1e25ammad, in his zeal for order and decency, would by no means allow. He urged that Hasan was disqualified by the mere fact of his origin. He belonged to a house only of wazirs, whereas the chief of the state was a descendant of kings. Nevertheless, Hasan held to his point until he had provoked a tumult with bloodshed; but in this Fortune declared against him, and he retired a fugitive to \u0643\u0644\u064a\u0629, where he dwelt three years. Then Mu\u1e25ammad determined to taste for himself what he had so often bestowed upon others, so, having ejected Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, he assumed the style and performed the functions of royalty. When he had thus sufficiently gratified ambition or curiosity he abdicated, and called Fu\u1e0dayl b. Sulaym\u0101n to the vacant place.\n\nAt the beginning of the seventh chapter the author, with unwonted precision, records the exact date of the accession of Fu\u1e0dayl, namely, the year 901 after the flight. Now as soon as \u1e24asan heard of Fu\u1e0dayl\u2019s accession he determined to make war against Kilwa, and advanced as far as a place called \u0645\u0639\u0645 \u063a\u0648\u0628. At the same time an ambassador was sent to Kilwa from the court of Zanzibar to endeavour to make peace between \u1e24asan and Fu\u1e0dayl on the basis of the\nrestoration to the former of his title and power. Mu\u1e25ammad, who was still really at the head of affairs, met the proposals of the ambassador with his old appeal to constitutional propriety. It was out of the question to eject a prince of the blood-royal in favour of the son of a waz\u012br. When it happened before it was for a particular reason which existed no longer. If \u1e24asan consented to take his place as an ordinary citizen with the rest, he would be allowed to come back, but not otherwise. The ambassador was charged to return with this answer to \u1e24asan, but he postponed his departure for a few days, and in the interval Mu\u1e25ammad died. In fact, if not always in name, he had governed the country for fifteen years, and he was succeeded in his capacity of Am\u012br by Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, son of the Sultan Sulaym\u0101n. While the ambassador was making his way back to Zanzibar with the news of Mu\u1e25ammad\u2019s death, \u1e24asan was preparing to advance upon Kilwa with a large force of Muslims and infidels. He had heard of the death of Mu\u1e25ammad, and imagined that the last obstacle in the way of his ambition was now removed. He set out from \u063a\u0631\u0628 \u0645\u063a\u0645\u060c but when he had reached a place called Kisibi, Fu\u1e0dayl and Ibr\u0101h\u012bm became aware of his approach, and sent a deputation of the chief men of Kilwa to demand the reason of his hostile attitude and movements. He replied that the object of his expedition was to assert his claim and his right. No one but himself was entitled to rule. It was true that he had been ejected by Mu\u1e25ammad, but for no cause except the antipathy between them. Finally he instructed the deputation to press his claim upon the Am\u012br and the people of Kilwa\u2014Fu\u1e0dayl was not mentioned\u2014in order that he might return to his own country and resume his rightful place. To all this Fu\u1e0dayl and the Am\u012br simply replied in the old terms of Mu\u1e25ammad. Whereupon \u1e24asan changed his tactics. He took no notice of the answer; but despatched his son Sa\u02bf\u012bd with a numerous following to Kilwa. They entered the town to all appearance like ordinary travellers, and took up their abode at their own house. As soon as they were settled the Sultan\nand the Amir sent a large force to bring Sa'id into their presence. At first he offered resistance, but he was overpowered and brought with some of his following before the Amir, who demanded the reason of their coming in such force to Kilwa. Sa'id replied that his father had sent him merely to get a house ready for him, and that Hasan himself would arrive shortly, but with no hostile intention. When it was urged that he would hardly have brought such a large following, if he had not meant mischief, he again denied it; so, to make sure, they compelled him to swear to the truth of his denial by God most high and the glorious Koran. He was then instructed to communicate the fact to his father, warning him at the same time to make no move that night, but to wait till the following day, when he would be met by the Sultan and the Amir, and escorted peacefully to Kilwa. Accordingly the deputation set out, consisting of some of Sa'id's own followers reinforced by a party from the town; but when Hasan learnt all that had been done in his name or on his account, he killed those of them that belonged to Kilwa, and prepared to advance upon the place that very night. But the people were on the alert and kept guard with all their forces until daybreak, when they were suddenly attacked by the troops of Hasan. A great battle was fought, the result of which was so decisive, that Hasan's one care, when he heard it, was to save himself by flight to \u063a\u0631\u0628. Here he founded a kingdom, which, after his death, passed in succession to his son Muhammad and his grandson Hasan.\n\nIt was during the reign of Fudayl that the news was brought from Mozambique of the appearance of three ships of the Franks under the command of an admiral named \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u062a\u064a. After a few days they passed Kilwa without touching, and made for \u0628\u0646\u063a\u0634\u0629, where the chief and people, in ignorance of their true character and intentions, were at first inclined to receive them hospitably; but being warned by one who knew the intruders better that in reality they came for nothing but espial and spoliation, the Muslims then tried to cut their anchors, in\norder that the ships might run aground and so be destroyed and plundered. But the trick was discovered, and the strangers sailed away to Malinda; and here the people, though they well knew that their coming boded no good, were too frightened to refuse them anything they chose to ask in the shape of wood, water, and other provisions. Lastly they demanded a pilot, and departed, first for India, and then for their own accursed country. All this happened in the year of the flight 904, a year otherwise remarkable in that it witnessed the birth of the author of this book. In the year 906 came the Qab\u012bt\u0101n \u0628\u064a\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0631\u0633 with several ships to Kilwa. He demanded wood and water, and that the Sultan or his son should be sent to confer with him. However, the Amir and the people would not venture to let the Sultan go in person, so they disguised one Luqm\u0101n, son of al-Malik al-\u02bf\u0100dil, in the fashion of royalty, and sent him instead. Then they carried the water down to the shore in vessels, and signalled to those on board to come and fetch it. But at this moment one of the Amir's servants, named \u1e24\u0101jj Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, went down to the beach, and ordered all the water to be taken away, so that when the Christians arrived, they found none, and returned in anger to their ships. Then they went to Malinda, where they were again cordially received, and supplied with whatever they demanded. But before their final departure they chose seven men that were Christian perverts. Two of these they settled at Malinda; four they sent to Guzerat, to the Sultan Ma\u1e25m\u016bd, and the seventh to Kilwa. As for the Indian agents, their Christian activity was soon cut short, for they were circumcised by the lord of the country, and embraced Islam. At Kilwa the people were at first in doubt whether they should receive the uninvited guest; but in the end their fear of the power behind him prevailed, and they quartered him upon a distinguished citizen named Mu\u1e25ammad b. Rukn ad-D\u012bn. This man was a merchant of great wealth and high character, under whose guidance the Christian spy made himself acquainted\nwith all the internal affairs of the country, both small and great. Mu\u1e25ammad was peculiarly fitted to act as informer, seeing that he had long been meditating treachery on his own account. In the year 907 came the admiral \u06a9\u062f \u0646\u0631\u0641 with a single ship to Kilwa. In appearance bent upon commerce, but in reality a spy, he too made friends with Mu\u1e25ammad, in whose treacherous schemes he saw his own opportunity. In the year 908 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u062a\u06cc returned with several ships. On his arrival he was immediately joined by the spy, who related all that he had learnt, especially that the government was in danger from the wealth and influence of Mu\u1e25ammad, and he advised the admiral to demand an interview with the Am\u012br Ibr\u0101h\u012bm. At first the people were inclined to play their old trick, and send a substitute, but the spy was too acute for them, so Ibr\u0101h\u012bm went to the interview accompanied by two lawyers named Ayy\u016bb and \u2018Umar. At this point the author suddenly breaks off with the words, \u201cHere ends what I found.\u201d\n\nIt will be seen that this narrative deals for the most part with local circumstances and confined interests; nevertheless it is not without salient points at which it can be brought in contact with larger cycles. Y\u0101k\u016bt makes no more than the bare mention of Kilwa, as follows:\n\n\u0643\u0644\u0648\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0643\u0633\u0631 \u062b\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0648\u0641\u062a\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u0648 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0647\u0627\u0621 \u0628\u0644\u0637\u0641 \u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0644\u0649\n\u0645\u0648\u0636\u0639 \u0628\u0627\u0631\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u064f\u0651\u0632\u064e\u062c\u0650 \u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629\n\nnor does Ibn Ba\u1e6d\u016b\u1e6da, in his account of his travels, devote much space to it: \u201cI set out by sea for the city of Kulw\u0101\u02be (\u0643\u064f\u0644\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0627), which is large, and consists of wooden houses\u201d (tr. Lee, p. 57). The statement in the text that the island was first colonised by Persian emigrants in the middle of the ninth century corresponds in the main with what we\n\n1 \u201cNever Kulw\u0101\u02be as in Ibn Ba\u1e6d\u016b\u1e6da\u2014probably a clerical error\u201d (Burton, l.c. ii. p. 341).\nlearn from other sources. For example, Rigby, in his *Report on the Zanzibar Dominions*, writes (p. 47): \"The earliest settlement of Arabs on the east coast of Africa, of which there is any authentic account, is that of the El-Harth tribe from the neighbourhood of Bahrein, who, about the year A.D. 924, founded the cities of Magadosha and Brava. About sixty years later, the city of Kulwa was founded by a colony of Persians from Shiraz, and from these settlements the Arabs and Persians gradually extended their authority over the whole of the east coast as far as Sofala, and also possessed themselves of the islands of Zanzibar, Pemba, and Monfesa\"; and Burton records a similar tradition (\"The Lusiads,\" iv. p. 416): \"The foundation of Kilwa by the Arabs is popularly assigned to A.D. 960\u20131000; but the settlements may have existed in the time of the Periplus.\" Of the places other than Kilwa at which the Persians landed \u0645\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0641\u0650\u0633\u064e\u0629\u064c or \u0645\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0641\u0650\u0633\u064e\u0629\u064c is obviously Mombasa. This would appear in any case from the context, but the following gloss on fol. 7b of the MS. makes it certain:\n\n\u0642\u0641 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0645\u0646 \u062a\u0648\u0644\u0649 \u0641\u064a \u0643\u0644\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0645\u0646\u0641\u0633\u0629 \u0623\u064a \u0645\u0645\u0628\u0627\u0634\u0629\n\nIbn Bat\u016b\u1e6da spells the word \u0645\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0641\u0650\u0633\u064e\u0629\u064c (Lee, l.c.). \u064a\u0646\u0628\u0639 is apparently the island of Yambe (Burton, l.c. ii. p. 132). \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0628\u064a\u0631\u0629 is \"Pemba, called by the Arabs 'Al-Khuthra' or the green island.\" \u0647\u0646\u0632\u0648\u0627\u0646 is Hinzuwan or Anjuan (Burton, l.c. i. p. 340). Whatever we may think of the story about cutting the trench and so changing Kilwa from a peninsula into an island, in any case it affords a possible explanation of what Correa notices in \"The Three Voyages of Vasco da Gama\": \"The city stands on an island which is surrounded and encircled by the sea-water, but on the land side there is little water, which at high tide is knee-deep.\"\n\nIn 1857 Burton heard at Kilwa itself the native account\n\n---\n\n1 Rigby, l.c. p. 27; cf. Burton, l.c. p. 419.\n2 Tr. Stanley, Hakluyt Society, p. 291.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1895.\nof the purchase of the island: \"A certain Shaykh Yusuf from Shangaya bought land from Napendu, the heathen headman, by spreading it over with cloth, built the old fort, won the savage's daughter, slew his father-in-law, and became the sire of a long race of Shirazi 'Kings of the Zinj.'\" However, he adds in a note, \"the tale of the cloth is suspicious\" (\"Zanzibar,\" ii. p. 362). It may be worth noticing that Burton (l.c. p. 357) gives the same name to the mainland as it bears in our text, 'Barr el Moli.' whatever may be its correct form, is here undoubtedly the name of a tribe; but it was taken by De Barros for the name of a king. He speaks (\"Asia,\" Decada i. Liv. viii. cap. vi.) of a certain \"Ale Busolouquete,\" whom, though he belongs to the period of the early struggles of the immigrants with \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0645\u062f\u0646\u064a\u0646, it is difficult to fit into the chain of events as we have it, \"ao qual succedeo Daut seu filho, que foi lan\u00e7ado de Quiloa aos quatro annos de seu reinado per Matata Mandalima, que era Rey de Xanga seu imigo, e Daut se foi pera Monfia, onde morreo.\" If, however, we assume what seems probable, that the two accounts have diverged from a common source, we might venture to identify the \u0634\u0627\u063a of our text with Xanga. Concerning the latter place Burton writes as follows (\"Zanzibar,\" ii. p. 358): \"Southwards, at the bottom of the bay, appeared the islet of S\u00e1nje Kati, and opposite lay the Mlango, or gate where the depth diminishes from eighty to six fathoms, and leads to S\u00e1nje M\u00e1joma. This may be the Changa of the Kilwa Chronicle, whose 'King' Matata Mandelima expelled in early days Daud, the Sultan of Kilwa.\"\n\nThe episode of the rebuilding of the mosque receives a certain addition of historical probability from the account of De Barros (l.c.), who attributes to 'Soleiman Hacen' great activity in the way of fortifying and beautifying Kilwa; but there is this difference, that whereas in our account the restorer was compelled by the incompetence of his workmen to use wood where his predecessors had used\nstone, Soleiman Hacen is said, like another Augustus, to have found Kilwa wooden and to have left it stone. Dr. Rieu gives about A.H. 859 as the date of Mas\u02bf\u016bd\u2019s arrival at Kilwa (\"Catalogue of Arabic MSS.\", Supplement, p. 392). Our account of what preceded and followed the expulsion of Mas\u02bf\u016bd from Aden differs considerably from that translated by Johannsen in his \"Historia Ieman\u00e6.\" For instance, the latter makes no mention of the coming of Mas\u02bf\u016bd as a suppliant to Kilwa, or of his final retirement to India. Is it possible that in \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0646\u062f we may have a corruption of \u0647\u0642\u0631\u0629, one of the places to which Mas\u02bf\u016bd is said to have made his way after leaving Aden? \u0648\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f \u0646\u062e\u0631\u062c \u0628\u0644\u063a \u0641\u064a \u062e\u0631\u0648\u062c\u0647 (Or. 3265, fol. 40; cf. Johannsen, l.c. pp. 187 and 273). \u0643\u0644\u0647\u0647 is, perhaps, Kwale or Khwale (Burton, l.c. i. 144 and ii. 335). The reading \u0645\u063a\u0645 \u063a\u0631\u0628 is not without its difficulties; but the not very violent change of \u0628 to \u0646 would enable us at least to compare \u0645\u0639\u0646 \u063a\u0648\u0646 with Mgongeni, that is Kilwa Kivinjya (Burton, l.c. ii. p. 341). Our whole difficulty is involved in the endeavour to harmonise two different systems of geography\u2014the ancient, in which 'Kilwa' is used, or seems to be used, as the name of a single place; and the modern, in which the same name denotes a varied district of towns and islands. This being so, I can only suggest the possibility of a connection between Kisibi and what is now called (Kilwa) Kisiw\u00e1-ni or Kisim\u00e1-ni. The coming of the Franks merges the provincial squabbles at which we have been assisting so far in a national commotion:\n\n\u0648\u0645\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u062c\u0631\u064a \u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0627\u0631\n\u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0646 ......\n\u0648\u0628\u064a\u0646 \u062e\u0635\u0645\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u0646\u062c\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0627\u0641\u0631\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u062a\u064a denotes Vasco da Gama, not by name but by the title which De Barros is always careful to use when speaking of him, Almirante. It was on his first voyage to the East\nin 1497-99 that he passed Kilwa in the manner described in our text. \"They arrived before Quiloa,\" says Correa (l.c. p. 89), \"where the Lord sent them a contrary wind, so that they were unable to fetch the port, where the Moorish pilot had determined on wrecking the ships even though he died for it there on the spot, from which the Lord delivered them by not giving them a wind for entering into the port; and they ran along the coast, and reached the port of Bombaza, also a great city of trade with many ships.\" It may be observed that what the piety of the chronicler explains as the intervention of God, the fancy of the poet attributes to the favour of Venus (Camoes, Canto i. 100-102). We also learn from Correa that the person who understood the real character of the strangers\u2014and warned the inhabitants of Mombasa against them was the Shaykh of Mozambique himself (l.c. p. 99). Moreover, the little episode of the anchors was one which the Portuguese chroniclers, at any rate, were not likely to forget or to suppress. \"At midnight two canoes began to cut the moorings of the Berrio and the Sam Rafael: they fled when the alarm was given\" (Burton, \"The Lusiads,\" iv. p. 425).\n\nPedralvares Cabral, the discoverer of Brazil, who \"set out as chief captain of thirteen ships on the 9th of March, 1500.\"\n\nJo\u00e3o da Nova, who set out on the 15th of March, 1501 (Commentaries, l.c.).\n\nVasco da Gama set out on his second voyage in 1502. There is no talk this time of being supernaturally conducted past Kilwa and its dangers; on the contrary, the admiral is determined to get the island into the power of the king, his master. Our text leaves it in doubt whether the Amir Ibr\u0101h\u012bm had actually replaced the Sultan Fudayl by fair means or by foul, or whether, as in the case of Mu\u1e25ammad Kiw\u0101bi, he wielded the real power behind a puppet king.\n\n1 The commentaries of the great Afonso Dalboquerque, Hakluyt Soc. ii., p. xviii.\nWe learn, however, from De Barros, that before the arrival of the Portuguese 'Habraemo' had become 'absoluto Senhor de Quilhoa' (\"Asia,\" i. 2, p. 230), while Burton records a more definite tradition to the effect that \"the great port was then ruled by a certain Sultan Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, murderer and usurper\" (\"Zanzibar,\" ii. p. 363). The account of the spies is illustrated, if not literally confirmed, by the statement of De Barros (l.c. i. 1, 406) that Pedralvares, before he started for India, left behind him two agents named Jo\u00e3o Machado and Luiz de Moura with instructions to find a way of penetrating into the kingdom of Prester John. The Portuguese word *degredados*, applied to these agents, corresponds with sufficient exactness to the Arabic \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062a\u0646\u0635\u0631\u0629.\n\nMu\u1e25ammad b. Rukn ad D\u012bn we may suppose to have been the real name of the interesting personage who meets us in the Portuguese annals variously disguised as Mahamad Anconij, Mahomed Arcone, and Mahomed Enconim. It appears that when Da Gama proposed an interview with Ibr\u0101h\u012bm, the latter asked for a safe-conduct. The sequel is thus told by Correa (l.c. p. 293): \"The king, after sending to ask for the safe-conduct, came to another decision, which was not to go and speak with the captain-major. There was with the king a very rich Moor, and the chief man of the city, named Mahomed Arcone, who entertained thoughts of rising up against the king, and with false intentions he said to the king that he ought to go to the captain-major and not be wanting to his word, because the captain-major would not violate the safe-conduct which he gave him; and the Moor said this because he well understood that the captain-major would not let the king go unless he did what he required of him, during which something might intervene by means of which he might be made king, and he would do all that the captain-major wished.\" This exactly coincides with the Arabic account of the character and policy of Mu\u1e25ammad, while the passage in which De Barros describes the meeting between the admiral and Mu\u1e25ammad, each triumphant in\nhis own way, throws light upon the alleged earlier intrigues of Muhammad with Jo\u00e3o da Nova: \"o Almirante folgou muito de o ver, por qu\u00e3o fiel amigo sempre se mostrou aos Capit\u00e3es que alli foram. The admiral took much pleasure in seeing him, as he had been a faithful friend of the captains who had gone there\" (l.c. i. 2, p. 32). Muhammad lived to reap the fruit of his statesmanlike sagacity in his own elevation and the degradation of his country. 'The king' became a vassal of Dom Manuel of Portugal, and eventually in 1505, when \"D. Francisco d'Almeyda, first viceroy of Portuguese India, landed a force of 500 men and fired the city, Sultan Ibr\u0101h\u012bm fled, and was duly deposed in favour of one Mohammed Ankoni, who had proved himself a friend to the Europeans: he preferred, however, placing the power in the hands of Micante\u00b9(?) the only son left by the murdered Sultan Alfudayl (El Fuzayl)\" (Burton, \"Zanzibar,\" ii. p. 364).\n\nIt is, therefore, not to be wondered at that the chronicler or the scribe should fail us just at the critical time; and after all it may be doubted whether the entire suppression of what might sound awkward or disgraceful in the telling, damages the cause of truth in the long run more than the civilized art of misrepresentation to which our political and ecclesiastical historians have accustomed us in the West. Ex nihilo nihil fit, and a vacuum may be filled with a verity; but lies once produced multiply at such a rate, that\u2014like the vermin in the Greek monastery\u2014if they were all of one tendency, they would cast truth out of house and home.\n\n\u00b9 This 'Micante' is evidently the same as Muhammad \u0100k\u016br, whose reign was described in one of our missing chapters.\n\u0628\u0633\u0645

MS.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n\n1. THE BURMESE HITOPADESA.\n\nWadham College,\nFebruary 12th, 1894.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014I shall be obliged if you will permit me to ask a few questions from our members, and especially those in Burma, regarding what is commonly known as the \"Hitawpadetha\" (Hitopadesa), which was published in Burmese, at Rangoon (with other matter), in 1881, and translated by me in the Indian Magazine in 1887.\n\nIt purports to be a direct translation, from the \"Thinthagaraiik\" (Sanskrit), of that portion called \"The acquisition of Friends,\" but differs considerably from the versions generally known. As far as the end of the story of Dirghakar\u1e47a and the Vulture (Jalatta) the resemblance to Johnson's version is strong, and it appears that many parts are literally translated, but, after this point, though there are one or two similarities, it is clear that, if the translation has been continued, and it is not merely the work of a Burmese compiler, there must have been a totally different Sanskrit version.\n\nParts of the Hitopadesa are quoted in the \"Mani-ratana-p\u00f4n,\" a historical work, edited by the Abbot Candala\u1e45k\u0101 in A.D. 1781, but they differ slightly from the version published in 1881.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1895.\nThe questions I would ask, then, are:\u2014\n\n1. Who was the author of this translation?\n2. When and where did he live?\n3. Are there any other Burmese versions?\n4. Is there a Sanskrit text to be found in Burma?\n5. Is there a version peculiar to Southern India or elsewhere from which this has been taken?\n\nThis version should contain the following stories:\u2014\n\n1. The elephant who was killed by jackals.\n2. The hermit and the Kinnari.\n3. The story of Prince Srigutta.\n4. The story of the thrush (?) and the kite.\n5. The frog who killed the lion.\n6. The quick-witted monkey and the crocodile.\\(^1\\)\n7. Guttaravasi, the merchant who was lost by the mutiny of his crew.\n\nOne remarkable fact about the Burmese version is, that it is perfectly free from anything that is indecent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. F. St. Andrew St. John.\n\nTo the Secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\n---\n\n2. Setebhissara.\n\n37, Nordre Fasanvej, Frederiksberg, Copenhagen.\n\nFeb. 4th, 1895.\n\nMy Dear Sir,\u2014I am inclined to agree with Mr. St. A. St. John in referring the inscription of the gold leaf scroll found at Rangoon to Binya Nw\u0113, \"commonly known as Rajadirit (Rajadhiraja),\" if his father was the only one called \"Lord of the white elephant,\" for I think now that the expression setebhissara (which is as good P\u0101li as setibhissara) really must be dissolved into seta+ibha+issara = lord of the white elephant, and not into Setebha+issara,\n\n\\(^1\\) This is not the same as V\u0101narinda-j\u0101taka.\nas there is no people or land called Setebha. And when Binya Nw\u0113 is styled r\u0101j\u0101dirit=r\u0101j\u0101dhir\u0101j\u0101, and is said to have taken possession of Dagun, now Rangoon, and to have devoted his latter years to religion, this fits well with the inscription in which he is called r\u0101j\u0101 sabbar\u0101jissaro, etc., and ratanattayam\u0101mak\u014d, saddhasaddho, etc. If kupati cannot be taken as a noun proper, as you think, it will very well do to understand it with the same meaning as bh\u016bp\u0101ti=the sovereign of the land.\n\nAs for the scroll, I remember the late Mr. Norris, one day in 1858, bringing it to the Asiatic Society's Rooms for my inspection. He had himself gone down to Professor H. H. Wilson, at the East India House Library, to fetch it. Mr. Norris was a very conscientious man, and I am sure he himself would have taken it back again to the East India House. I suppose, therefore, that it must now be kept either in the India Office Library or in the Indian Museum attached to it.\u2014Believe me, dear Sir, yours sincerely,\n\nV. Fausb\u00f6ll.\n\n3. The Vidy\u0101dharapitaka.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014It may not be without interest to the readers of the R.A.S. Journal to notice a citation and short quotation of the Vidy\u0101dharapitaka contained in the \u0100dikarma-prad\u012bpa (MS. R.A.S. Cat. by Cowell, and Eggeling, No. 69, and Minayef, Recherches sur le Bouddhisme, trad. Assiez de Pompignan, dans Mus\u00e9e Guimet).\n\nThe so-called Vidy\u0101dharapitaka has hitherto only been known through \"Hiouen Thsang's Life and Travels\" (see St. Julien's translation, i. 159, ii. 38, and S. Beal's Fo-Koue-ki), and more recently through I-tsing's translation by M. E. Chavannes, pp. 101, 102, \"Les pri\u00e8res magiques se disant en Sanscrit p'i-t'i-t'ouo-louo-pi-ti-kia (Vidy\u0101dharapitaka). La traduction de p'i-t'i (Vidy\u0101) est pri\u00e8res magiques, t'ouo-louo (dhara) signifie tenir dans les mains,\npi-ti-kia (pi\u1e6daka) signifie recueil. Il faut donc dire : le recueil de pri\u00e8res magiques.\"\n\nThe St. Petersburg Dictionary, smaller edition, gives the word Vidy\u0101dhara-pitaka, followed by the sign ? In the larger edition is added the note: \"Vidy\u0101dhara Pi\u1e6daka (vie de Hiouen Thsang, 159), doubtless a mistake for Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b Pi\u1e6daka, as is the reading in Hiouen Thsang, ii. 38. To judge by the index it is this last which is wrong.\" And surely enough the index under Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b Pi\u1e6daka has, \"Read Vidy\u0101dhara Pi\u1e6daka (Kin-tcheou-thsang).\" But the above-mentioned passage in M. Chavannes' important contribution establishes clearly enough that in this instance the St. Petersburg W\u00f6rterbuch is wrong.\n\nThe few lines of Hiouen Thsang concerning the Vidy\u0101dharapitaka are worthy of inquiry and discussion, as they are, nowadays, the very basis (alas! insufficient) of the historical scheme about the Buddhist Mah\u0101y\u0101na canons. What are the facts about the Vidy\u0101dharapitaka (Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b-pitaka) and the equally obscure Samyuktasa\u00f1cayapitaka?\n\nDr. Kern, in his wonderful sketch of Northern Buddhism, has tried to explain names and things with a most reliable carefulness; I dare not say always with a definite certitude. The problem is a very hard one, and a large part of the work is given to theory. Perhaps it may happen that Dr. Kern's hypothesis will be confirmed by a further examination of documents, and if so, no one will be more glad than myself, as the story of H\u012bna and Mah\u0101y\u0101na becomes far more intelligible if we are duly authorized to accept the conclusions of the Dutch scholar.\n\n\"In Hiouen Thsang we find a very important statement. He tells us that at the Council of R\u0101jagrha, immediately after the death of the Buddha, five Pi\u1e6dakas were composed, that is to say, the three official or canonical ones, and besides them the Samyukta Pi\u1e6daka and the Pi\u1e6daka of Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b's, which he elsewhere mentions under the title of Vidy\u0101dhara Pi\u1e6daka. This statement of the Chinese pilgrim is quite true, if only its true meaning be grasped. There is not the smallest ground to suppose that the charms were younger\nthan the Suttas, the Vinaya, or the Abhidharma. Whether the collection of them, as we now have it, is as old as that of the three Pitakas can neither be proved nor disproved till it has been edited. . . . The Pitaka of the Dh\u0101ra\u1e47i\u2019s corresponds to the Atharva Veda, just as the three others correspond to the three other Vedas . . .\u201d\n\nThe passage of the \u0100dikarmaprad\u012bpa which is the subject of this letter, is a very short one; it occurs at the end of the work in a somewhat diffuse explanation of Tantra ritual and Vinaya precepts. It runs (fol. 12a in fine)\u2014\n\\[ \\text{Na mandracittena sarvad\u0101 muditacittena n\u0101pyanyacittena:} \\]\n\\[ \\text{tath\u0101 coktam Vidy\u0101dharapitake:} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Tap\u0101s tap\u0101msi sarv\u0101\u1e47i dirghak\u0101lak\u1e5bt\u0101nyapi} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Anyacittena mandena sarvam bhavati nisphalam} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Punah prad\u0101yavel\u0101y\u0101m} \\]\n\\[ \\text{ity\u0101di saddharmasv\u0101dhya\u015b\u0101din\u0101 p\u016brvvar\u0101tram j\u0101garik\u0101 karttavy\u0101.} \\]\n\nIt is unnecessary to point out the very common character of this idea. I think I have read it several times already, presented in the same or quasi the same terms, especially in the Bodhicary\u0101vat\u0101ra by \u00c7\u0101ntideva, A.D. 600 (edidit Minayef)\u2014\n\\[ \\text{Tap\u0101s tap\u0101msi sarv\u0101\u1e47i dirghak\u0101lak\u1e5bt\u0101ny api} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Anyacittena mandena v\u1e5bthaivety \u0101ha sarvavit.} \\]  \n(B.C.A. v. 16.)\n\nI am, of course, not able to say whether the writers of the \u0100dikarmaprad\u012bpa had in their minds the same Vidy\u0101dharapitaka of the Chinese pilgrims. There may be many Vidy\u0101dharapitakas. A Vidy\u0101dharapitaka (dh\u0101ra\u1e47i-pitaka) is properly a basket of books or special works (like S\u016btras or S\u0101stras in Brahmanical schools) for the use of men directly engaged in magical business. The Vidy\u0101dharas are not only \u201chimmlische Boten\u201d or \u201cEngel,\u201d but also \u201cdes porteurs de pri\u00e8res magiques\u201d (compare the meaning of the word \u201cvidv\u0101n\u201d in Tantra rituals).\n\nWe have (Cambridge, Paris, Calcutta) several collections\n\n1 Kern\u2019s \u2018Buddhismus,\u2019 i. 510 and foll.\n(samgraha) of Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012bs and H\u1e5bdayas which can claim to the title of Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b or Vidy\u0101dhara-pi\u1e6daka. Like writers of similar handbooks the editor of Hiouen Thsang\u2019s Vidy\u0101dhara-pi\u1e6daka (used or referred to in the Vih\u0101ras visited by the pilgrims, and compiled at an uncertain date) had, for the completion of his work, to correct every M\u016blatantra approved by the regular schools Mah\u0101sa\u1e45ghikas, Yog\u0101c\u0101ras (see Wassilief\u2019s Buddhism). Every Buddhist work has been canonical and worshipped as \u201cword of Buddha\u201d (Buddhabh\u0101\u1e63itam) by some part, not in every case known, of the Sa\u1e45gha.\n\nEmploying the word Pi\u1e6daka in this historical sense, it appears that Vidy\u0101dhara-pi\u1e6daka would include all the reliable works of medi\u00e6val times which could have been classified amongst the Yogatantras (compare Pa\u00f1cakrama, ii. 1).\n\nIn the actual state of our knowledge it would be unwise to say more. The Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b and the Vidy\u0101dhara-pi\u1e6daka seem to be different names for the same thing. Can it be affirmed that some Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012bpi\u1e6daka or Tantra Sa\u1e45graha has been promulgated by the Mah\u0101sa\u1e45ghikas of R\u0101jagrha, together with the three Catholic canonical baskets? Nobody can yet hope to have a certain opinion on this point. To repeat the very words of Dr. Kern, \u201cNichts kann weder bewiesen, noch widerlegt werden ehe die sanskritischen und chinesischen Texten edirt sind.\u201d The only disputable point is the very \u201cvraisemblable\u201d opinion of Dr. Kern. Our Tantra and Dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u012b collections are not so modern as it has been said; they have in the Atharvamantras in the Kangikas\u016btras a very old and classical prototype. Both Tantra and Atharva manuals have, I daresay, the same origin, and that a contemporaneous one.\n\nIt is established by the present notice that the Vidy\u0101dhara-pi\u1e6daka is not, as MM. Roth and B\u00f6htlingk seem to be persuaded, a word fancifully elaborated by Stanislas Julien, or Chinese writers.\u2014Yours respectfully,\n\nLouis de la Vall\u00e9e Poussin.\n\nGhent University.\nFeb. 22nd, 1895.\n4. Chinese Biographical Dictionary.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014Would you allow me to call the attention of your members to the existence, in the Society's Library, of a very valuable biographical dictionary? It is usually known as the Shih-hsing-pu, but is entered in the published catalogue (J.R.A.S. 1889) by a fuller title, \"Li-tai-ming-hsien-lieh-nu-shih-hsing-pu,\" a biographical account of successive generations of illustrious men and virtuous women. As the word *men* has been omitted in the catalogue translation of the title, and the fuller title used in the catalogue is unusual, the existence of this important book may easily be overlooked. It is not in the University College collection.\u2014Yours faithfully,\n\nE. H. F.\nNOTES OF THE QUARTER.\n\n(January, February, March, 1895.)\n\nI.

Arbuthnot read a paper on the \"Nig\u0101rist\u0101n,\" a Persian didactic work, written in A.D. 1334\u201335 by\nMu'in-ud-Din-Juwaini, and not hitherto translated into any European language.\n\nThe paper commenced with a sketch of Persian literature, from the time of Naushirwan, a Sassanian king [A.D. 530-578], to the end of the sixteenth century A.D. It then went on to describe the work forming the subject of the paper as follows: The Nigaristan, or Picture Gallery, was written in imitation of Sa'di's Gulistan or Rose Garden, as the author himself tells us in his Preface, of which the following is an extract:\n\n\"One day, in my great despondency and helpless languor, I found myself with some intimate friends in the assembly of my father, Ibn Mu'in Al-Juwaini, who was among the most distinguished of the period for his literary accomplishments and tastes. I heard how the compositions of old authors were being discussed, and how everyone present quoted, according to his ability, passages from some favourite author, praising him to the utmost, until the turn of the Gulistan of Shaikh Sa'di arrived, a work which is a storehouse of elegant verses and witty sayings. The whole assembly unanimously praised the beautiful composition and perfect elegance of the arrangement of the treasure book of sovereigns, the facility of whose diction and subtlety of whose meaning fully harmonize with the tones of the organ, and the beautiful colour of red wine, yea, represent the limpidity of the rivers of Paradise and of the water of life. The company bore witness to its eminent high degree, and its unparalleled excellence.\"\n\n\"I said that although this Gulistan is like the fabled garden of Iran, the abode of such flowers [of speech] and of curiosities of stories, that it may be expatiated upon and explained down to endless future generations, it has already since a long time become the subject of discussion, not only in learned assemblies, but also of common storytellers, so that its beauties are considered trite and obsolete. This is the special fault, not of the Gulistan only, but of the human mind, which soon becomes fatigued by the incessant repetition of even the most elegant books. Thus\nmany treatises of ancient authors here, after being locked up in libraries of colleges, fallen into disuse and neglect to such a degree that boys just beginning to learn to read exchange them in the bazaar for blank paper in the shops of booksellers, and more especially at the present time when people are oppressed by calamity.\"\n\nThe author then goes on to relate how he hinted that his father should undertake the writing of a new book in the style of the Gulistan, but the latter recited the following distich of Firdausi:\n\n\"The father has become old, and thou art young;\nThou art fit for war and heroic deeds.\"\n\nAfter much consideration of the difficulties, with meditation, hesitation, delay, and encouragement by his friends, all of which are described at considerable length, the author at last makes up his mind to set to work, and says:\n\n\"Although I had no wares to offer in the bazaar of those who are endowed with excellence, and had no renown among the learned, I complied with the desire they had expressed, began my arduous work, wrote on the same day a portion of the chapter 'On Generous Behaviour,' and continued the work till I brought it to completion, ending with the following verse:\n\n\"When Mu'in\u012b drew the characters of this picture,\nIt was the Arab year seven hundred and thirty-five;\nBy the efforts of the musk-dropping reed,\nThe door of a hundred closed treasures was opened.\nThe author hopes his name will survive\nWhen he is removed from this perishable world.\"\n\nThe author then goes on to describe how and why the book was named the Nigaristan, a recital of which fills some pages in the Preface. And then with an apology to men of excellence and a trust in the leniency of critics, and an expression of good wishes towards the Hamavi family, he finishes his Preface and gives the table of the\ncontents of his work, divided into seven chapters, as follows:\n\n1. On generous behaviour.\n2. On asceticism and piety.\n3. On laudable conviviality.\n4. On love and amorousness.\n5. On preaching and advice.\n6. On virtue and mercy.\n7. Various admonitions.\n\nMr. Arbuthnot's paper then gave a short description of the contents of Sa'di's Gulist\u0101n or Rose Garden, and of J\u0101mi's Bih\u0101rist\u0101n or Abode of Spring, works of the same nature as the Nig\u0101rist\u0101n, and then proceeded:\n\nAbout the author of the work, by name Maulana Mu'\u012bn-ud-D\u012bn Juwain\u012b, a few words will not be superfluous. He is supposed to have lived during the eighth century of Hijrah [A.D. 1301\u20131398], but the exact date of his birth and death cannot be fixed. He is reputed to have been a man of great piety, and a disciple of Shaikh Sa'd-ud-D\u012bn \u1e24umm\u016bl in Sufism, and of Fakhr-ud-D\u012bn Isfara'in in Sciences. Like Sa'd\u012b, Mu'\u012bn\u012b appears at one time of his life to have been a wandering Dervish, but to have travelled generally in company with others, and not alone. He alludes to a stationary habitation or monastery in which he lived, and to other circumstances of his life in the Nig\u0101rist\u0101n. It is uncertain whether he was married or not, but he alludes always in very respectful terms to his father, who was likewise a Dervish and a scholar of high attainments.\n\nThe Nig\u0101rist\u0101n, an imitation of Sa'di's Gulist\u0101n, is considered by some critics to be superior to it. The work is well known in Persia and Central Asia, for the astronomer, Prince Ulugh Beg, to whom the Shaikh Bahrabad brought one copy as a present, caused it to be transcribed in the most elegant manner, and it thus obtained great celebrity in the countries beyond the Oxus. It was written during the years A.D. 1333\u201335. There are two good copies of it\nin the British Museum, one of which is described in Dr. Rieu's catalogue of Persian manuscripts there, while the other has been lately purchased in Teheran, both in good order and complete. The Bodleian Library at Oxford possesses three copies of this work, all noted in Professor Sachau and Ethe's catalogue [No. 1447-1449] of Persian works there. In the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale at Paris there is only one copy of the work, not very well copied, and at St. Petersburg there is a copy in the Imperial Public Library. No copies are to be found in the Libraries of Berlin, Vienna, Rome, Gotha, Munich, or Leyden, neither are there any in the India Office Library, or in the Libraries of King's College and Trinity College, Cambridge, or Eton College. The work may, therefore, be said to be rare in Europe, and has not been hitherto translated into any European language. It may be here stated that there are several other works of the same name, written by various authors, and dealing with different subjects. But of all these, the present one under review, a collection of moral and other anecdotes in prose and verse, is the most celebrated.\n\nThe translation of the N\u012bgarist\u0101n was prepared by the late Mr. E. Rehatsek from three copies of the work, which he compared and collated. One copy he had in Bombay, and the two others were sent to him from this country, one of them being a copy made from the manuscript in the British Museum, and the other a very correct and well-written copy obtained from Mr. Quaritch.\n\nThe whole of the work will be found to be permeated with Sufism, a creed and a subject which seems to have had an extraordinary attraction for many Persian poets and authors. To enter into full details of this interesting belief would take up too much time. The late Professor Palmer has described Sufism as \"a strange combination of the pantheism of the Aryan races and of the severe monotheism of their Semitic conquerors, and aims at leading men to the contemplation of spiritual things by appealing to their emotions. The keynote of the system is that the\nhuman soul is an emanation from God, and that it is always seeking and yearning to rejoin the source from whence it sprang. Ecstasy is the means by which a nearer intercourse is obtained, and absorption in the Divinity the ultimate object to be obtained.\"\n\nWith this explanation it will perhaps be easier to understand the constant references to the Deity that are contained in the following phrases: \"I am a hidden treasure, and I would fain be known.\" \"That all is He, and all is from Him.\"\n\n\"Neighbour, companion, and fellow-traveller, all is He;\nIn the habit of a beggar and in the satin of a king, all is He;\nHe is in the concourse of divisions, and concealed in the mansion of reunion:\nBy God, all is He; certainly by God all is He.\"\n\nAgain: \"What is Thine is mine, and what is mine is Thine.\" \"You am I, and I am You.\"\n\nSo long as the Sufi is conscious of the least distinction between God and himself he is not thoroughly permeated by the Unity of God. To attain this perfect knowledge and to arrive at the stage of direct Union with God, can only be acquired by a long course of study, contemplation, and intelligence. The manner of reaching this unintelligible mental condition is described in Sufistic language as that of a traveller journeying [i.e. turning the attention towards God] along the road, and putting up at various inns or taverns [i.e. stages in which the traveller is immersed in the Divine mysteries] previous to his arrival at a complete knowledge of the Truth [God]. This journey is commenced by the neophyte or searcher after God, who, continuing his inquiries, becomes a disciple, and is then fairly launched as a traveller, whose whole business in life is the prosecution of the journey so that he may ultimately arrive at the Knowledge of God. The seven stages of this journey are described as those of Worship, Love, Seclusion, Knowledge, Ecstasy, Truth, and Union. The last stage only is reached at death, which is extinction, or a total\nabsorption into the Deity, somewhat corresponding, it may be said, with the Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist theories of Moksha and Nirvana.\n\nThis sort of mysticism has apparently always had a great attraction for the mind of man in different stages of the world's history, both in the East and West. To illustrate this Mr. Arbuthnot gave some extracts from the story of John Inglesant bearing on this mystic feeling, and allusions were made to the Molinarists, Pietists, and Quietists, who were really following the steps of Sufism, which again probably originated in the further East.\n\nOut of the mass of stories in the N\u012bgarist\u0101n [there are 584 in all] connected with Kings, Khalifahs, Governors, pious Shaikhs, learned men, and other celebrities of that time, it is difficult to select a few as a sample of the whole. In the paper read there were six or seven stories given to show their nature and the style of the translator. The Sufi idea of complete Union is exemplified in the following:\n\n\"One day Laila wished to write a letter to Majn\u016bn; she took a paper and wrote [in Arabic]: 'From my soul to my soul, from my heart to my heart, and from my spirit to my spirit'; that is to say [in Persian], 'Excessive affection and perfect love have to such a degree blotted out the marks of difference and the line of distinction from the page of my nature, that when I write a letter I indite it from my soul to my own soul, and when I speak I address my own spirit, and when I cast a glance I behold my own eyes.'\"\n\nVerses: \"When I am longing for thy beauty\nI quickly place a mirror near my face;\nWhen I desire to hear thee speak\nI listen to what my tongue is uttering.\nHe is truly on the path of love\nWho is himself love, lover, and beloved.\nIf without me thou art in love with me\nMention not the name of 'Azra if thou art W\u0101miq.\nThe way from the lover to the beloved is short:\nLook well thyself, for both of them are one.\"\nI heard that when the letter was given to Majn\u016bn he uttered an exclamation, opened the seal, and said\u2014\n\n\"Is this the garden's zephyr or my friend's letter,\nOr a divine mercy, for the air is fragrant with ambergris.\"\n\nAs soon as his eyes alighted upon that ambergris letter, and upon those sweet words, he fled like one bereft of his senses to the desert, lost the reins of volition and choice, singing as follows:\u2014\n\n\"I have been altogether transmuted into my friend:\nMy luck has culminated in the utmost happiness.\nThe veil being removed, love becomes patent indeed.\nWhen the ecstasy of affection has become attained,\nIt is no wonder if 'Azra becomes W\u0101miq,\nAnd not strange if Laila be transmuted to Majn\u016bn.\"\n\nHere is a short story about the author himself\u2014\n\nWhen I was a boy I asked my father\u2014may Allah sanctify his soul!\u2014when people pretend to love each other, and to breathe fraternity: how can one tell whether their assertions are true, and their internal corresponds with their external disposition or not? He replied, \"When a man causes a brother to share in his pleasures.\"\n\n\"Whoever is selfish in his pleasure\nHis pretence of amity has no meaning.\"\n\nMany other specimens of stories might be given, but space does not permit.\n\nThe paper then concluded with a few passing remarks about the state of literary culture in Europe and England at the period when this elegant work was produced in Persia in A.D. 1334, and with the suggestion that the three great Persian didactic works, viz., the Gulist\u0101n, the N\u012bg\u0101rist\u0101n, and the Bih\u0101rist\u0101n, would be better appreciated and understood after a careful perusal of the Kor\u0101n, the life of Muhammad the Apostle by Ibn Ish\u0101k and Ibn Hish\u0101m, the chronicles or annals of Tabari, and the Rauzat-as-Safa by Mir Khw\u0101nd, a study of all of these being\nabsolutely necessary for the proper understanding and appreciation of Arabic and Persian literature.\n\n12th March, 1895.\u2014Lord Reay (President) in the Chair.\n\nIt was announced that\u2014\n\nMr. R. Alleyne Nicholson\n\nhad been elected a member of the Society.\n\nThe President drew attention to the great loss which the Society and the cause of historical research in general had suffered by the death of their distinguished Director, Sir Henry Rawlinson. It was impossible to exaggerate the importance, for the history of the development of Oriental ideas and institutions, of his magnificent work in the decipherment of the tablet at Behistun, and it was a matter of pride to the Society that the results of his remarkable discoveries were given to the world through the medium of the Society's Journal. The solidity of the results attained was a matter of worldwide acknowledgment, and a detailed account would be found in the notice of his life and work to appear in the next issue of the Journal. But we had to deplore the loss not only of a great scholar but also of a firm and true friend to the Society. From the date of his election as Director (in 1862) Sir Henry had been a most constant attendant at the Council meetings; and had devoted continued care to the management of the details of its work. His personal contributions to the Journal were then passed in review, and the President concluded by saying that he was quite sure he was only giving expression to the unanimous feeling of the Society by placing on record its deep sense of the loss which had been incurred.\u2014These remarks were received with profound sympathy.\n\nMr. R. Sewell read a paper on \"Some Buddhist Bronzes and a Relic of Buddha found at Bezw\u00e4da.\"\n\nThe paper will be published in full in the July Journal.\nII. OBITUARY NOTICES.\n\nAugust Dillmann.\u2014On the 4th of July, 1894, the Royal Asiatic Society lost one of its most distinguished Foreign Members, August Dillmann. His title to membership was the fact that he was beyond all dispute the greatest master of one of the Oriental languages\u2014of Ethiopic. His first publications, in the years 1847 and 1848, were catalogues of the Ethiopic manuscripts in the British Museum and in the Bodleian Library. His last publication, the close of which he did not live to see in print, was the fifth and concluding volume of the \"Biblia Veteris Testamenti \u00c6thiopica.\" In between we find a considerable number of publications bearing upon the Ethiopic language and literature, enough to form the life-work of a vigorous scholar. Nevertheless this was but one part of Dillmann's whole work, and, if I am not mistaken, not the part in which Dillmann himself recognized the accomplishment of the chief task of his life. The study of the Old Testament had led him to the Ethiopic language, and the Old Testament remained the real centre of his studies and of his labours. During the last twenty years of his life, as far as I heard him speak of his tasks and aims, his attention to Ethiopic seemed to be a special fancy to which he gladly came back as often as he could from the manifold labours in the sphere of Old Testament exegesis laid upon him by force of engagements previously entered into. In spite of this, the exposition and due appreciation of the Scriptures of the Old Testament appeared to him, without doubt, to be the chief object of his endeavours, not only in the chairs he held, but also in his literary activity. His interest in the Old Testament was by no means of a merely philological cast, but was primarily determined from a historical and theological point of view.\n\nChristian Friedrich August Dillmann was born on the 25th of April, 1823, at Illingen, in Wurtemberg. In Wurtemberg he received his entire education, from the beginning of instruction in Latin to the close of his University terms at T\u00fcbingen. Entering upon the study\nof theology and Oriental languages, he enjoyed particularly the impulse given by Heinrich Ewald, who at that time, after his dismissal from the professorship at G\u00f6ttingen, had found shelter at T\u00fcbingen. Dillmann remained his steadfast and faithful pupil. As a student Dillmann was a member of the T\u00fcbingen \"Stift,\" a foundation, the members of which live together under strict obedience to set principles. He retained all his life the grave and sometimes stiff manner of bearing that characterizes the pupils of this foundation. In his case this manner was softened, both by contact with different and more facile habits of life in his later positions outside of Wurtemberg, and especially by that ease of behaviour which purity and clearness of disposition and a feeling of sympathy towards other men tend under all circumstances to produce. After finishing his studies, Dillmann filled, for a little more than six months, during 1845 and 1846, a position in the practical service of the church as vicar at Sersheim, in the neighbourhood of his home. He never afterwards held pastoral office. So far as I know, apart from the observances of church habit, he held aloof with an unmistakable persistency from activity in movements that served ecclesiastical aims. This certainly was not from lack of interest in such movements, but because in a prudent self-restraint, based doubtless upon wise self-knowledge, he believed that he was destined to an exclusively literary activity. After taking the degree of doctor of philosophy at T\u00fcbingen in 1846, he spent about two years in Paris, London, and Oxford for the purpose of scientific work. Coming back he lectured at T\u00fcbingen for five years, from 1848 to 1853, at first as Repetent and then as Privatdocent and Extraordinary Professor of Theology, on the Old Testament and also on Oriental languages. Then followed a period of eleven years, from 1853-1864, in the University of Kiel, where, as an extraordinary and then as an ordinary Professor in the philosophical faculty, he lectured on the Old Testament and Semitic languages, and at the same time on Sanskrit. From 1864 to 1869 he taught in Giessen as a member of the theological faculty, and to this faculty\nhe also belonged in Berlin, as successor of Hengstenberg, during an activity of twenty-five years, from 1869\u20131894. Manifold honours were paid to him during this long career. The confidence of his colleagues placed him as rector at the head of the University once in Giessen and once in Berlin; six learned societies elected him to membership.\n\nHe enjoyed these honours much and heartily, as appeared especially at the celebration of his seventieth birthday. But work in and of itself was for him a greater pleasure than all such results of work. There has seldom been a life so full of labour. He scarcely knew what holidays were. The words of the Psalmist, that what is precious in life is labour and toil, were truer of him than of many other, even scholarly, labourers. When as a young man, just after finishing my university course, I made Dillmann's acquaintance, what impressed me most was not the extremely gentle way in which he brought his demands to bear, in the private lessons in Ethiopic which he kindly gave me, but the strict discipline of work that he enforced upon himself, and this impressed me almost painfully. One who approached him for the purpose of learning, received at first the impression that he had no interest in life aside from his work, but this impression was only just when compassed by many limitations. The love of his family testifies that as a husband and father he knew how to lavish affection to a rich degree. The same was the manifold experience of the writer of these lines, even after he had advanced from being a pupil to being a fellow-worker. Never on visiting him, or in writing to him, did I refer to anything that concerned me personally without meeting on his part with hearty and refreshing sympathy. I can judge of him only from a single, quite definite side. I saw him but a very few times outside of his study, and never in intercourse with other men of his own age. Nor did I ever hear a regular lecture from him, for, apart from the above-mentioned private lessons, I only took part in exercises of interpretation in Syriac under his direction. Everywhere here a never-failing accuracy and clearness were\npre-eminent; he was strict in demanding from the pupil grammatical correctness, and he was impatient of carelessness. Those who heard his regular lectures have always lauded that same exactness, and he fascinated, by the value and thoroughness of the material presented, all students who were inclined to learn. Doubtless even those who cherished no such inclination came finally to respect what he wrought out and laid before them, and the method in which he laid it before them, that is to say, the avoiding of all superfluity, even though he, not merely from natural bent but just as much of set purpose, shut out everything like brilliancy or beauty of discourse that could bribe a student.\n\nThis method, which showed itself in the man, is manifested also in his writings: Dillmann was, as a whole, a man of the most thorough unity of nature, in whom everything fitted together, and in whom you could clearly perceive the common kinship of all the elements. His Ethiopic grammar (1857) is a model of clearness, not only because of the incomparable regularity of the Ethiopic language itself, but also because of the exemplary treatment of it on the part of the author. A thorough study of this work is adapted to impart, even to one less gifted in that respect, an understanding and a love for grammar. The same conscientiousness and perspicuity which Dillmann had evinced in the treatment of the interesting language, appear also in his discussion of the much less enjoyable Ethiopic literature. He illuminated unwearingly the abstruse delineations of the book of Enoch, piercing into their most hidden recesses. The numerous essays that Dillmann furnished for the publications of the Academy of Sciences at Berlin are also models, particularly those that treat of out-of-the-way and narrowly limited questions, as, for example, the inquiry about \"Baal with the feminine article\" (1881), which is final in its kind. As early as the year 1869 Dillmann supplied a new commentary on the Book of Job for the \"Brief Exegetical Handbook of the Old Testament,\" published by Hirzel. During the last twenty years of his life, after the first treatment of Genesis for the same\ncollection in 1875, he busied himself to a still greater extent in the sphere of Old Testament exegesis. He often sighed under the yoke of this commentary work. The whole of the Pentateuch, Isaiah, and, as the last exegetical service, Job in a new edition, were issued by him. These commentaries are universally acknowledged to be a repertory of exegesis, a store of stupendous material, collected with unwearying industry. Their exegetical insight and tact are universally conceded. Perhaps a later day will value also the critical procedure of these commentaries more than the present day does. Dillmann worked unceasingly, and was glad to learn even from those whom he opposed. Nevertheless, he did not cease to place a by no means to be despised veto upon the newest construction of Old Testament literary history. To the view that during the last twenty years has spread in ever wider circles, namely, that the ceremonial law of the Pentateuch was a creature only of the post-Exilic time, Dillmann up to the end was able to allow only a very limited truth. The so-called Priestly Codex stood with him in essentials as pre-Deuteronomic. This opposition to the construction of the newest criticism of the Pentateuch is merely a single manifestation, and one that especially catches the attention, of the adverse position that Dillmann in general held towards the modern criticism of the Old Testament. The whole method of this criticism was uncongenial to him\u2014its procedure with the text, its proofs for the dates given. He remained more conservative than the modern critics, not from dislike to novelties\u2014for he himself joined in many a one\u2014but from a greater self-restraint in judgment and a stronger need of firm reasons for decisions than others have. How far correct perception was furthered by the boldness of the other side, a boldness that often was not destitute of genius, and how far by Dillmann's cautious prudence, must be left by his fellow-workers to a future decision.\n\nWolf Wilhelm Count Baudissin.\n\nMarburg in Hessen, December 14, 1894.\nDr. S. C. Malan.\u2014On the 25th of November last there passed away, at the advanced age of eighty-two, the Rev. Solomon C\u00e6sar Malan, D.D., who was without doubt by far the most accomplished Oriental linguist in England. He was, however, not an Englishman by birth, but a native of Switzerland, born at Geneva in April, 1812. He came to England in 1833, and entered the University of Oxford as a member of St. Edmund Hall in that year. His early bent for the acquisition of many languages is illustrated by a story told about his matriculation examination. Being but imperfectly acquainted with English at that time, he is said to have asked leave, with perhaps a touch of the self-confidence of youth, to write his answers in French, German, Italian, Spanish, Latin, or Greek. Before leaving his native country he had also acquired some knowledge of Sanskrit as well as Hebrew. He accordingly gained the Boden Sanskrit Scholarship in 1834, only one year after the election of the first Boden Scholar and two years after the appointment of H. H. Wilson to the newly-founded Chair of Sanskrit at Oxford. This success he followed up in 1837 by winning the Pusey and Ellerton Hebrew Scholarship. In the same year he took his degree after obtaining a second class in Literae Humaniores, and left for India on being appointed Senior Classical Professor at Bishop\u2019s College, Calcutta. Here, as Secretary of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Mr. Malan became personally acquainted with the Under-librarian, Alexander Csoma de K\u00f6r\u00f6s, the founder of Tibetan studies in Europe, and lost no time in availing himself of his teaching. De K\u00f6r\u00f6s thought so highly of Mr. Malan\u2019s attainments that he presented all his Tibetan books to his pupil when the latter left India. These volumes, forty in number, are now the property of the Royal Hungarian Academy of Sciences, to which Mr. Malan gave them.\u00b9 The MS. volume, however, on which De K\u00f6r\u00f6s\u2019 Tibetan Dictionary, published in 1834, is based,\n\n\u00b9 See J.R.A.S. 1884, p. 492 ff. Some further information as to Mr. Malan\u2019s Tibetan studies will be found in Duke\u2019s Life of Alexander Csoma de K\u00f6r\u00f6s, p. 142 (Tr\u00fcbner\u2019s Series), and in Schiefner\u2019s Tibetan Tales translated by Ralston, p. xii. (ibid.).\nwas presented by Mr. Malan to the Indian Institute, in the library of which it may now be seen.\n\nIll-health obliged Mr. Malan in 1840 to resign his appointment at Calcutta and to return to England. In 1842 he visited Palestine, where he spent some months. In the following year he took a curacy in Hampshire. Here the Rev. R. Chenevix Trench, subsequently Archbishop of Dublin, was associated with him as his fellow-curate. In 1845 he was appointed Vicar of Broadwindsor, Dorsetshire, a living which he held for forty years. He also held a rural deanery (1846\u201353) and a prebendaryship (1870\u20135). When the late Sir H. Layard went to explore the ruins of Nineveh, Mr. Malan took the opportunity of accompanying him thither, between May and July, 1850. In 1880 the University of Edinburgh recognized the merit of his theological writings by conferring upon him the degree of D.D. The last nine years of his life Dr. Malan spent in learned retirement at Bournemouth.\n\nThough Dr. Malan\u2019s studies ranged over a very wide linguistic field, his interests were by no means limited to those studies, but extended to several other subjects as well. Thus he devoted a good deal of time to natural history. His activity in this direction resulted not only in a valuable collection of birds\u2019 eggs, which he presented to the Museum at Exeter, but also in \u201cA Systematic Catalogue of the Eggs of British Birds,\u201d published in 1848. He was, moreover, a good artist. During his visit to Palestine he made numerous sketches, from which he painted several large water-colours. These were exhibited and sold for the Patriotic Fund at Burlington House after the Crimean War. They are said to have attracted considerable attention. Among the purchasers were Mr. John Murray and the late Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Dhuleep Singh. He also published in 1856 a treatise entitled \u201cAphorisms on Drawing.\u201d Bookbinding was another art in which he acquired skill. Several of the works presented by him to the Indian Institute at Oxford were bound with his own hand, among others the MS. volume of his \u201cNotes on the Book of Proverbs.\u201d\nDr. Malan was also a voluminous writer on religious subjects, about twenty-five publications of a theological character having proceeded from his pen. Several of these were, however, connected with his favourite Oriental and linguistic studies. Besides translations of devotional works from the Russian (1859) and Welsh (1887), he published \"A Preparation for the Holy Communion, translated from Armenian and other Eastern originals\" (1863), and a \"Life of St. Gregory, translated from the Armenian\" (1868). His treatise on \"Repentance\" is chiefly from Syriac sources (1866), and another translation is from Ethiopic originals (1882). He also published a translation of original documents of the Coptic Church (1872). Three of his treatises deal with Chinese religion and language (1855\u20136).\n\nThe closing eight or nine years of his long life were devoted to the publication of his magnum opus, the Old Testament Proverbs, illustrated with all the wealth of linguistic and Oriental knowledge which he had acquired by long and assiduous study. This was his \"Original Notes on the Book of Proverbs,\" the first volume of which appeared in 1889 and the third towards the close of 1893, within a year of his death. In this book he utilised the garnered linguistic acquirements of a lifetime. The completion of the work before his decease must have been a source of great satisfaction to the aged author. The materials for the book he had been collecting for nearly sixty years, having begun when still an undergraduate at Oxford. It comprises 16,000 notes, consisting chiefly of illustrations culled from thirty-seven languages, nearly all of which are Oriental. These parallels were at first all copied in the original characters into a manuscript volume, which may now be seen under a glass case at the Indian Institute. That volume shows that Dr. Malan was a master of Oriental calligraphy. His writing of the Devan\u0101gar\u012b character few have probably ever seen equalled; and his Chinese hand it would be hard to excel.\n\nThe evidence of Dr. Malan's \"Notes\" proves that he knew about forty languages. The Bodleian possesses a MS. volume of his containing Prayers and Psalms, in which over\neighty languages and scripts are said to be represented. His linguistic acquirements were therefore astonishing, and can only have been surpassed by an Adelung or a Mezzofanti. That he knew several languages well is shown by the translations referred to above; but that, with so wide a range, he could have attained a high standard of scholarship in any one of them, is doubtful. Those who have devoted themselves to a scientific study of language are well aware that the intellectual limitations of even the most gifted render it impossible for any man to learn half a dozen languages thoroughly. For a scientifically philological knowledge implies so extensive a historical acquaintance, not only with the grammar but the national thought represented by a language, that a lifetime is hardly enough to devote to the study of one alone. Had Dr. Malan concentrated his powers he would doubtless have acquired the eminence as a scientific scholar which he actually attained as a linguist.\n\nThe course of Dr. Malan's diversified studies led to the formation of a valuable Oriental library of about five thousand volumes. Hardly any Eastern language in which books have been printed is unrepresented in it. When the Indian Institute was founded more than ten years ago at Oxford, Dr. Malan most generously presented it with his library. Even since the important collection of Oriental books recently given by Sir M. Monier-Williams has been added, the Malan books still constitute nearly, if not quite, half of the Indian Institute library. Thus Oxford men have a special reason to cherish the memory of Dr. Malan as a benefactor of his old University. It must have been a great sacrifice to him to part with his books, for he was evidently much attached to them. Two or three hundred of them he still retained till within the last year or so, when, owing to failing eyesight, he gradually sent them to the Institute by instalments. The last box arrived in Oxford only a few weeks before his death. In a letter of October 8th, 1894, dated from Bournemouth, and addressed to the writer of this notice, Dr. Malan wrote: \"I send you my very last box of books, a very small one, but it contains\nmy volume of MS. notes on the Proverbs, which Sir M. Monier-Williams wishes to keep in the Indian Institute. I also enclose a relic well worth treasuring, viz. the portrait of Alexander Csoma K\u00f6r\u00f6si, the founder of Tibetan literature in Europe. I received from him my first lessons in Tibetan at Calcutta in 1837.\" Although he must have been nearly blind when he penned this letter, the handwriting is still remarkably bold and clear, showing no trace of the infirmity of old age.\n\nHis letters proved that he continued to take a lively interest in Oxford to the last. But he often seemed to look back with regret to the days of sixty years ago, having little sympathy with the changes which the University has undergone in recent times. The influx of lady students was perhaps the innovation to which he was most opposed. He also often expressed strongly conservative views regarding a practical question of scholarship, the transliteration of Oriental languages in Roman characters. This he regarded as a kind of barbarism, and could hardly bear to look at a book in which an Eastern language was thus degraded.\n\nWhen a scholar is suddenly carried off in comparative youth and the midst of achievement, there is naturally more \"sadness of farewell.\" Dr. Malan's friends, on the other hand, though they cannot but mourn his loss, have the consolation of knowing that death only came when his life's work was done, and approaching blindness had cut him off from the companionship of the books he loved so well.\n\nArthur A. Macdonell.\n\nHeinrich Karl Brugsch.\u2014The death of Heinrich Karl Brugsch\u2014or, as he was usually called, Brugsch Pasha, to distinguish him from his brother Emil\u2014marks an epoch in Egyptology. With him passes away almost the last of the older savants, but the younger school which followed has to a great extent been built upon the results of his labours. It is difficult for us who luxuriously consult our \"Denkm\u00e4ler\" in our own libraries, or turn over the leaves of our newly acquired \"Origines,\" to\nrealize the uncertain and tentative state of Egyptology in the earlier decades of this century. The discoveries of Young and Champollion had, it is true, afforded the clue to the deciphering of the hieroglyphs, but the Demotic script still remained a dead letter, and even men like Passalacqua, whose interest in Egyptology had led them to make costly collections of antiquities or conduct excavations in the Nile Valley, were the exponents of the wildest theories concerning the \"inner meanings\" which the monuments were supposed to conceal.\n\nIt was in such times\u2014the early days of 1827\u2014that Heinrich Brugsch was born in Berlin at the Barracks of the \"White Uhlans,\" in which corps his father was a non-commissioned officer. The future savant is said to have owed his passion for Oriental travel to his interest, at the early age of eight, in an old family Bible adorned with woodcuts, and in an illustrated book of travels published by a German Missionary Society! Before he was ten he had devoured a translation of Herodotus, and, in his own words, \"would have given half Berlin in exchange for one Theban tomb.\" His repeated visits to the Royal Collection of Egyptian Antiquities attracted the attention of Passalacqua. The studious boy was constantly observed copying hieroglyphs from the monuments, and Passalacqua introduced him later to Lepsius and Alexander von Humboldt, the latter of whom remained his patron and friend to the day of his death.\n\nMeantime Brugsch had been sent to the Gymnasium, where he found himself in the same class with von Caprivi and the two Princes von Reuss. All his spare day hours and often half his nights were devoted to Egyptology. From the study of the Demotic contracts in the Berlin Museum, and the Gnostic papyri of Leyden, he had, before his eighteenth year, drawn up a Demotic grammar in Latin which was printed at von Humboldt's expense. The whole treatise was written out by Brugsch himself in his exquisite handwriting, such a thing as Demotic type being then unheard of. The work attracted the attention\nof the learned. It was favourably reviewed by Emmanuel de Roug\u00e9 in the Revue d\u2019Arch\u00e9ologie, and on the very day of the appearance of the critique it was read by King Frederick William IV., who at once showed his appreciation of the young author by providing the funds for his three years course at the University of Berlin. Subsequently, to further his archaeological studies, the King also paid his expenses to Paris. Brugsch was here brought into contact with Lenormant, E. de Roug\u00e9, and de Saulcy, whose exclamation\u2014\"Voyez ce gredin de Brugsch, il nous plante nous tous\"\u2014at a sitting of the Institute, showed the friendly and appreciative spirit with which he was received in the French capital.\n\nHis visit to Paris and his conversations with de Roug\u00e9 convinced Brugsch that Demotic was governed by the same rules as the hieroglyphs, that in many cases he had been wrong, and had translated as letters certain signs which were, in fact, syllables, and lastly, that the Egyptian language, in its evolution from the Pyramid Texts to its latest development in modern Coptic, demanded a detailed and careful classification. To supply this want Brugsch conceived the idea of his great Demotic-Hieroglyphic Dictionary. This task he undertook soon after his visits to Leyden and Turin, although he did not actually begin to publish till 1868, continuing to bring out the work at intervals up to 1880.\n\nIn the year 1853, at the invitation of Mr. Harris, whose name has become immortalised by the papyri he discovered, Brugsch made his first visit to Egypt, all his expenses having been paid by the King, who had just at that time provided also from his own funds for the costly work of publishing Lepsius\u2019s \u201cDenkm\u00e4ler.\u201d Early in that season Mariette had made his great discovery of the Serapeum, and the large number of Demotic texts brought to light there yielded a rich harvest to Brugsch, who had begun to be regarded as the Champollion of Demotic. The two savants formed a fast friendship, which only terminated with the death of Mariette in 1881.\nEgypt in 1853 was a very different place from what it is today. There were then no public museums, the principal antiquities being in the hands of private individuals, Mr. Harris at Alexandria, Clot Bey and Herr von H\u00fcber in Cairo, having the richest collections. Part of von H\u00fcber's collection was subsequently sold for several thousand pounds to Sa\u00efd Pasha, and formed the nucleus of the Bulak Museum, now removed to Gizeh. Railways and steamers being then unknown in Egypt, the journey between Cairo and Alexandria was accomplished in a Nile boat, and took several days. Brugsch, on reaching the capital, was introduced by the Prussian Consul-General to the Viceroy Abbas I., and we may note in passing that the interpreter at the interview was a young Armenian named Nubar, the present Premier of Egypt.\n\nFor months Brugsch and Mariette occupied the house still pointed out to tourists at the Serapeum, and worked indefatigably by day at the excavations and by night at the deciphering of texts. The enormous interest excited in Paris by these finds aroused the Viceroy's jealousy, and he forbad the exportation of any more monuments. Brugsch has left us an amusing account of Mariette's defence of the Serapeum against the besieging efforts of the Viceregal troops, and of the detention of Abbas's envoy in a tomb while the valuable objects were conveyed by a caravan to the Nile, en route for the French capital.\n\nAfter a lengthy visit to Thebes, Brugsch returned to Europe, and as a result of his stay in Egypt published \"Reports on a visit to Egypt,\" followed by \"The Monuments of Egypt,\" the success of which obtained for him the post of Assistant Director, under Lepsius, of the recently opened Egyptian Museum in Berlin.\n\nMariette now begged him to come out to Cairo to assist him in arranging the Bulak Museum, in the completion of which Sa\u00efd Pasha, who had succeeded Abbas as Viceroy, was much interested. An expedition to Upper Egypt followed, the Viceroy providing a steamer and funds for excavations, during which Mariette and Brugsch worked\ntogether on the best of terms. Brugsch copied afresh the texts previously collected by Champollion, Rosellini, and Lepsius, and being a good draughtsman, his plans and drawings of buildings were excellent and accurate. His researches during the season 1857\u201358 were fully described in his \"Recueil de Monuments Egyptiens,\" published on his return.\n\nBy the death of Alex. von Humboldt in 1859, Brugsch lost his most enlightened patron and friend. Von Humboldt possessed the king's ear, and, had he only lived, probably his country would never have made the strange blunder of sending so distinguished an Egyptologist as Brugsch, in the capacity of Vice-Consul, to so uncongenial a spot intellectually as Teheran. Such, however, was the case. Brugsch, with characteristic industry, learned Persian in a month's time, and early in 1860 accompanied Baron von Minutoli and the rest of the Prussian Embassy to the Court of the Shah. Here he made the acquaintance of Sir Henry Rawlinson, then English Ambassador at Teheran, and had his attention drawn to the study of Assyriology. In company with Baron von Minutoli and five other Europeans, Brugsch made an expedition to Hamadan (Ecbatana) and the Persian Gulf; but the party were attacked by cholera, to which Brugsch all but succumbed at Persepolis, while Minutoli became its victim. Brugsch, after returning home, was appointed Prussian Consul-General at Cairo\u2014an uncongenial post which left him but small leisure for his archaeological studies. He returned to Germany in 1868, and during a visit to Paris was offered a Professorship at the Coll\u00e8ge de France by Napoleon III., on condition of his becoming a naturalized Frenchman. This, however, was too great a price to pay, and he accepted from his own Government instead the post of Professor of Egyptology at the University of G\u00f6ttingen.\n\nIt was at this period that he devoted most of his time to his great dictionary. He copied with his own hand the entire 3146 pages, containing some 8000 words in Hieroglyphic and Demotic, using a special ink for the\nreproduction of the work by process. The first published sheets excited the greatest interest: it is true that many mistakes were pointed out by his critics, but Brugsch was undaunted, and in the second edition corrected them all; errors in place-names being rectified by the subsequent publication of his \"Geographical Dictionary.\"\n\nHis stay at G\u00f6ttingen was, however, a short one, as in 1870 he again went to Egypt, at the invitation of Ismail Pasha, to assume the direction of the Egyptological School at Cairo, and astonished the Ulemah by lecturing in excellent Arabic on the hieroglyphs. He also was constantly in demand to accompany the many Royalties who visited Egypt to inspect the monuments. In 1873 Dr. Brugsch acted as Egyptian Commissioner-General at the Vienna Exhibition, and also organized the Egyptian Section at the Philadelphia Exhibition of 1876. After the fall of Ismail Pasha, Brugsch returned to Berlin, where he delivered at the University a series of lectures on Egyptology. Tewfik, on his succession, raised him to the rank of a Pasha.\n\nIn 1880 Brugsch again visited Cairo, and was with Mariette in his last hours. The story of Brugsch's opening the Pyramid of Metesouphis, and of his bringing the mummy of that king to Cairo to please the dying savant, is well known to the readers of his latest book, \"Mein Leben und mein Wandern,\" which was only published last year.\n\nDuring the season 1882-3 he accompanied Prince Frederick Charles of Prussia on a journey through Egypt and Syria (Palmyra), Greece and Italy, producing on his return an account of the expedition, entitled \"Prinz Friedrich Karl im Morgenlande.\" Two years later he was sent by the Emperor as Envoy Extraordinary to Persia, during which visit he wrote \"Im Lande der Sonne,\" and also translated into German verse a collection of Persian poems, which he entitled \"Die Muse in Teheran.\"\n\nIt is impossible in so short a space to give any adequate account of his numerous works. His \"Geographischen Inschriften alt-\u00e4gyptischer Denkm\u00e4ler,\" in 3 vols. (1857), was the first great work of its kind, and its three indices\nand careful arrangement show the grasp the author had of his subject. His \"Thesaurus Inscriptionum\" contains, in the last volume, an enormous number of bi-lingual inscriptions of the Ptolemaic period, and also valuable notes on Egyptian Astronomy. It was followed by a work on Egyptian Religion and Mythology, and by his \"\u00c6gyptologie,\" which is a compendium of learning on all Egyptian subjects. As early as 1861 he had started, and for some time continued to edit, the \"Zeitschrift f\u00fcr \u00e4gyptische Sprache und Alterthumskunde,\" but on his appointment as Consul at Cairo he handed the work over to Lepsius.\n\nBrugsch's great characteristics were, indomitable industry and the completeness with which he carried out all he undertook. No one ever collected more materials than he: it was inevitable in such an unsettled life and working at the rate he did that mistakes should occur; but he was indefatigable in correcting them, and never allowed himself to be embittered by adverse criticism or by the jealousy of rivals. His commanding but kindly countenance (resembling, as the King of Sweden remarked, \"ein vermilderter Bismarck\") will long be missed in Cairo, where he was very popular. His opinion of the English occupation of Egypt is remarkable, coming, as it does, from one who had received his dismissal from his official position in Cairo at the hands of an Englishman. Only a few months before his death he wrote as follows: \"British activity, combined with necessary severity, has worked almost incredible wonders. The European standard, as understood by England, has been applied to Egypt, resulting, in my opinion, in a real blessing to the country.\"\n\nM. L. McClure.\nIII. Notes and News.\n\nThe Ruins of Anuradhapura.\u2014The survey, exploration, and account of this ancient capital of Ceylon, which dates from B.C. 460, have at length been completed, and are now ready for publication. The editor, and late Architect to the Ceylon Government, has evidently taken great pains with this very elaborate and highly interesting work, consisting of upwards of 60 folio illustrations and a like number of pages of letterpress, the whole preceded by a concisely written but graphic historical preface. We have not heard where copies are to be obtained, or on what terms, but we believe that portions of this valuable work will be forwarded to many of the learned societies, by, we presume, the Crown Agents for the Colonies.\n\nOriental Studies in Ceylon.\u2014Mr. N. Don Martino de Zilva Wickremasinghe, Assistant Librarian of the Museum at Colombo, after studying Indian philology and archaeology at the Universities of Erlangen, Munich, and Berlin for two years, has recently come to England for a short time, and is now working in the British Museum. He has been awarded Dr. Muir's Prize at Berlin University for diligence and progress in Oriental Studies, and he hopes to return to Germany to finish his course and to compete for the degree of Philosophic Doctor. For two years before leaving Ceylon, at the request of the Archaeological Commissioner, and on account of his special knowledge of Sinhalese literature and history, and of his skill in deciphering ancient inscriptions, he was seconded to serve on the Archaeological Survey at Anuradhapura. He is the editor of the Nik\u0101ya Sangraha, a history of the Buddhist Church in Ceylon, which was published at the Ceylon Government Press in 1890. Mr. Wickremasinghe is the first Sinhalese scholar who has ever come to Europe to perfect himself as an Orientalist.\nIV. Notices of Books.\n\nThe Dawn of Civilization: Egypt and Chaldea. By Professor Maspero. Edited by Professor Sayce, and translated from the French, with permission of the Author, by Mrs. Edmund McClure. Published by the Society for Promotion of Useful Knowledge, with a Map of Egypt, and over 470 Illustrations.\n\nThis is a noble and epoch-making work: it marks a period in our knowledge of the subject: it is true, that those, who for many years have studied the great drama of Egyptian Archaeology, will find much restated, which they knew before, but for the fresh student it will be sufficient to read Maspero, and accept facts and opinions from him, which are fortified by ample reference, at the foot of each page, to all previous authors of all nationalities.\n\nPerhaps the name of this great work might have been less ambitious. For instance the people of India would not admit for a moment having in any degree, or at any time, derived their civilization from a country so far West as Egypt, and, as Professor Maspero has no personal knowledge of the Archaeology of Mesopotamia, and confessedly derives his facts from the esteemed authors, whom he has consulted, it would have been better to have named the book \"The Dawn of Civilization in Egypt.\" Professor Sayce, who is an authority on both the Egyptian and Mesopotamian problem, in his Preface, page v., draws attention to this. Professor Maspero's acquaintance with Assyriology is wonderful and accurate, but there are depths, which only a specialist on that subject can sound: he speaks as an authority, one of the greatest authorities, on Egypt, but is only an industrious quoter from other authorities, when he ventures into Chaldea, which geographically is in the centre of Asia, and is credited with certain relations with China, and not impossible influences from or to India, while Egypt from its first to its latest hour of independence sate apart, as regards its language, its\nReligious conceptions, its ideas on a Future State, and its Architecture. It is one of the peculiar weaknesses of Semitic and European writers, to limit their conception of \"all the world,\" \"tout le monde,\" \"kul he eretz,\" to the Semitic, Hellenic, and Latin, Settlers on the shores of the Mediterranean, or the tiny populations of Egypt and Palestine, forgetting that one moiety of the fifteen hundred millions of the round world (as it is now) dwelt on the Eastern side of the River Euphrates, perfectly uninfluenced by Western Asia or Europe until within historic times, and only partially even now. In the story of the two brothers given by Maspero in the Revue Arch\u00e9ologique, March, 1878, the younger brother is described as a good workman, who had not his equal in the whole world. TO-R-TER-W, la terre enti\u00e8re, for Egypt, to the narrator of the story, was the whole world.\n\nThere are nine chapters of this stately book of 800 quarto pages. The first chapter is geographical. The derivation of the name of the country, Egypt, and the River Nile, is discussed, and is still uncertain: the name of the country \u1f08\u03bd\u03cd\u03c0\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 is traced by some to \"haikuphtah,\" the home of Phtah, by others to \"ai kaphtor,\" the island of Kaphtor, by a third party to \"\u03b3\u03cd\u03c8, a vulture.\" The River Nile can only be approximately traced to the words \"Nahr,\" or \"Nakhal,\" the Semitic term for a River or Torrent. The people of Egypt called themselves Romitu or Rotu (p. 43) and their country \"Khini\" or \"Kham,\" the black land. They knew their river, from which they derived their prosperity, as \"H\u00e2pi, the father of the gods, the lord of substance.\" At page 44 the author discusses the date of their origin, and, remarking that the oldest monuments scarcely transport us further than six thousand years B.C., he postulates a date for the first appearance of the Egyptian race in the basin of the Nile of at least eight or ten thousand years B.C. What becomes then of Archbishop Usher's Chronology, taught to this day in Public Schools, of the Creation of the World 4000 years before Anno Domini, and how are we to explain the Hebrew narrative,\nthat Abraham, who was born during the lifetime of Shem, one of the survivors of the Noachian deluge, went down into Egypt, then an ancient kingdom, which had a history of 4000 or 6000 years even then: it is obvious, that the Noachian deluge was restricted to Mesopotamia, and did not extend to the basin of the Nile.\n\nWhence did the Egyptian race come? Prof. Maspero states, that it is difficult to recognize the hypothesis of an Asiatic origin (p. 46): it must have been of African origin, and came into Egypt from the West or South-west, and after its settlement destroyed the black race, which preceded it in occupation, and later on received an accretion of Asiatic elements, introduced by way of the Isthmus. The language has, according to his authority, some connection with the Semitic family: this may be more accurately stated, that the Hamitic languages of North Africa differ less from the Semitic family than they do from any other known Family or Group of Language: we can hardly go further. Lastly he notices the extraordinary resemblance of the present people of Egypt after the lapse of many centuries with the pictures of their ancestors painted on monuments: I was struck with the fact, when I first visited Egypt in 1843, and watched the great Egyptologist Lepsius collecting his materials in the neighbourhood of Cairo: perhaps I am the only survivor of an expedition headed by him to the great Pyramid. I mentioned this fact to Professor Maspero, when I paid him a visit forty-two years later, in 1885, in his Dahabeah at Luxor in my last visit to Egypt, following the expedition of Lord Wolseley as far as Assouan and Phil\u0153, where I saw the telegram of the battle of Abu Klea nailed on a tree.\n\nIn Chapter II. Professor Maspero treats at great length (seventy pages) on the gods of Egypt, their number and nature: I am not sure, that he has added to our previous knowledge, but he has systematized the outcome of the labours of others, such men as Brugsch, Naville, Mariette, Renouf, Lef\u00e9bure, Petrie, Pleyte, Lepsius, Champollion,\nWilkinson, Rosellini, Chabas, De Roug\u00e9, and at the same time has incorporated his own invaluable studies: at the foot of each page are the references to his authorities.\n\nIn Chapter III. he deals with the Legendary History of Egypt, in which the myths of Osiris and Horus occupy so large a part. In other countries there is a sharp dividing line betwixt the legends of Divine dynasties, and the Annals of Mortals: in Egypt they blend into each other: in fact the idea of an impersonal, yet omnipotent, Ruler of the whole world, not only of the petty basin of the Nile, had not been attained: such indeed was the intellectual and spiritual position of all the elder Nations before 800 B.C., when the Hebrew Race slowly arrived at the fact, that there was one only God; and they ceased to be monolatrist, and became monotheists. But the Egyptians did arrive at a conception of a Future State, Rewards and Punishments, at a period long antecedent to the time of Moses, and yet the only reward, that that law-giver can offer to the Hebrews in return for obedience to his law is, that the days of the faithful should be long in the land that was given to them. At page 188 we read how the dying Egyptian was furnished with answers to be given at the great day of Judgment to the questions of the Judge, some of them going to the very foundation of human morality, others relating to mere ritual trifles: that a departed soul should be taught (p. 190) how he could cry out before the Judge\u2014\"I am pure: I am pure\" indicates a great advance in Religious conceptions. Escaping from the darkness of the tomb the enfranchised soul found itself in bright meadows, and thence embarked in the boat of the Sun to accompany that bright luminary in his daily journey. As time went on, in that clear climate the Egyptians became acquainted with the stars, and at page 205 we read of their Astronomical tables, and how they got over the difficulty of the number of days to make up the Solar year: this led them on to Astrology, Magical Arts, and elementary Pharmacy, and Healing of an empirical character; but it is interesting to read, that\nthe symptoms of the diseases of the people of those remote ages correspond with the diseases prevalent to this day among their descendants (p. 217). To the same benevolent Divine Ruler, Thoth, the Egyptians were indebted for their knowledge of Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, Drawing (p. 220), and we seem to touch solid ground, when we read, that he also taught them the art of writing, without which posterity would not have known what manner of men they were. Many a Race had passed away unappreciated, misunderstood, because they had not invented the art of communicating with Posterity, and storing up the knowledge of the Past. Speaking to the eye soon superseded the limited capabilities of speaking only to the ear. As we read, we feel that we are sitting at the cradle of the great Alphabetic systems, which have made Asia and Europe what they are, if from one point of view the heirs of all the ages, from another point the instructors of the whole world in its widest geographical sense in all the Sciences, and all the Arts, which discriminate Man from the Beast, and for all this we are indebted to those early Egyptians, who worked out the conception of Pictorial Ideographs, developing thence Syllabaries, and Phonetic Alphabets. This is a matter of received Science: Phenicia borrowed the conception of Phonetic signs from Egypt, and handed it on the West to the Hellenic and Latin Races, and on the East to the Semitic Races, and to India. The syllabaries in Cuneiform characters of Mesopotamia died leaving no successor: the Ideographs of China still exist, and it is impossible to predict the consequence of the literary contact of Europe with the Extreme Orient: but the fact must be recorded as the greatest Glory of the Egyptian people: they may or may not have imparted their culture, and knowledge of Divine Things, to the Hellenic Race, but the Greek Language would not have attained its inapproachable perfection, had the Hellenic Race not learnt the art of conveying sounds to phonetic symbols through Phenicia from Egypt.\n\nThe Hebrew Race never realized, that to their old enemies,\nthe Egyptians, they were indebted for the invention of the Phoenician written characters, which they used down to within a century of our Era, and in which the Samaritan Pentateuch has survived to our time. But for that the Old Testament would never have been committed to writing, any more than the Books of Zoroaster, the Hindu Sages, or Buddha; for the written character, used by all four, can be traced back to the Hieroglyphics of Egypt, and there never existed any other alphabetic system in the world, which is not traced back to that one fountain-head, either in germ, or development. If the Hebrew Race were ordained to convey to future ages the great Religious Conception, which dominates the present epoch, the honour belongs to the Egyptian Race of having invented the machinery for recording and handing on the written memorials, in which those conceptions are contained.\n\nThe date of the Exodus seems in these last days to have been fixed on scientific grounds. The discoveries made at Tel-al-Amarna in Egypt, and Lachish in Palestine, show clearly that at that date, the reign of Amenophis IV. or Khu-n-Aten, Egypt was in possession of the country. The date of the death of Rameses II. is fixed on astronomical grounds at 1281 B.C. It must have been at a date later than that when the Hebrews migrated from Egypt into Palestine, as no trace of Egyptian occupation is recorded. The migration of tribes from one region into another was not an event, which would cause surprise, either in those days or in comparatively modern times. The difficulties connected with the use of the Phoenician alphabet at so early a date by a law-giver, whose sole experience was in Egypt or the Desert, and by the Hebrews, a tribe of shepherds, who had been centuries in a house of bondage, is not, however, removed.\n\nIn Chapter IV. we pass to the Political Constitution of Egypt. There were three great Periods:\n\nI. The Memphite Period, or the Ancient Empire: Dynasties I. to X.\nII. The Theban Period: Dynasties XI. to XX.: the Invasion of the Shepherd Kings is represented by the XV., XVI., and XVII. Dynasties.\n\nIII. The Saite Period: Dynasties XXI. to XXX.: the Persian Conquest divides this Period into unequal parts.\n\nIt gives an idea of the superior antiquity of Egypt to note that Abraham came down to Egypt in the time of the XII. Dynasty, that Jacob and Joseph dwelt in Egypt in the time of the XV. Dynasty, and the Sovereigns of the XIX. Dynasty were contemporary with Moses; Shishak of the XXII. Dynasty was contemporary with Rehoboam, and Hophra of the XXVI. with Jeremiah.\n\nThe King was himself deemed to be a God, and always entitled \"Son of Ra,\" which title was preceded by the symbols indicating the Sovereignty of the two Egypts, North and South: after all his titles came the symbols of \"Life, Health, and Strength.\" Polygamy was practised to a frightful extent by Kings and Princes: children swarmed in the Palaces: Brothers married Sisters: Sons married the widows of their Father. There were the usual consequences in trouble at every change of the Crown, and bitter hatred amidst the different children. The daughter of Pharaoh mentioned in Exodus is credited with being a great personage, but she was one of many, and probably given in marriage to some courtier or official, and a person of no more political consequence than the daughter of an European Sovereign.\n\nTwo things, however, were necessary to maintain the Royal authority: I. the Protection of the Gods; II. the Arm of the Flesh: it is very much the same now: we put up prayers for the welfare of the State, but we take care to keep our powder dry: but one sole Deity is now recognized by Christians and Mahometans: with the Egyptians it was different: the celestial world was the faithful image of the terrestrial: it had its Empires, and its organizations, and the gods were dependent on the gifts of mortals, and the\npower of each deity depended on the number of its worshippers: when they received large offerings, they gave strength to overcome enemies, and came down to assist in battle: all readers of Homer's Iliad can recognize this feature: ritual and offerings were the duty, and sound policy, of Pharaoh, and all his subjects. The actual territorial domains of the gods formed at all periods about one-third of the country: the Priests had a fine time of it: the King was the dispenser of priestly patronage. The high priest of Om, or Heliopolis, whose daughter was married to Joseph, was a member of the Royal Family. Joseph's sons Ephraim and Manasseh and their descendants, no doubt, thought much more of the greatness of their Egyptian mother, than of their father, the son of a Hebrew herdsman, as the rank of men in that country was through the mother rather than the father.\n\nCoinage of metal was unknown: all transactions were by barter. The only kind of national metal-exchange in use in Egypt was a copper wire or plate bent, and this \"tabnu\" is the sign invariably used in hieroglyphics (p. 324). Gold and silver rings were used in barter, but there was no guarantee of their intrinsic value, or of their weight: on the other hand, not without reason, the invention of Geometry was justly credited to the Egyptians. The vagaries of the Nile destroyed all boundaries, and compelled them to measure the area, and record it: a square of 28 acres was the unit (p. 328). This was the basis of the Land-Tax, the amount of which, however, depended on the annual rise of the Nile, which also was carefully measured. The system of government adopted was as bad as could possibly be. The poor man had no incentive to lay by for the future, for he knew, that his wife and children might at any moment be carried off: his only plan was to consume at once what came to hand, and then, if necessary, to starve: he had nothing, which he could call his own, and, when he died, he had only the prospect of a similar state in the next world.\n\nChapter V. gives an account of the Memphite Empire.\nIn that period commenced the occupation by the Egyptian King of a Region in the Peninsula of Sinai for the purpose of supplying turquoises, and other minerals. This fact is placed beyond doubt by the engraved stel\u00e6 on the sides of the mountains. This opens out the question, discussed by Professor Sayce in his late works on the Monuments and Higher Criticism, as to the actual identification of Mount Sinai of the Exodus: the usually received site of Mount Katharine is close upon the territory occupied by the Egyptians above alluded to.\n\nUnder the fourth Dynasty were erected the great Pyramids: the earlier Kings were buried in flat-roofed square monuments called \"Mastaba,\" made of earthwork. Khufui, called Kheops by the Greeks, reigned 23 years: whatever he did was neither better nor worse than the work of his predecessors, but the gigantic size of his tomb, the Great Pyramid, has bestowed upon him immortality, and his name is familiar to all. On the same Hills of Gizeh still appears the head of the Sphinx, which was erected in the third dynasty. The Great Pyramid, with very few exceptions, maintains its position as the loftiest work of man in the world, 476 feet high, on a basis of 764 feet square, the area of Lincoln's Inn Fields: but time and decay have reduced these dimensions. His son Khephren erected the second Pyramid, 394 feet, to the south-west of that of his father, at a height of only 443 feet. His son Menkawri erected the third Pyramid with an elevation of barely 216 feet. These Monuments were justly among the wonders of the elder world, and share with the Memnon-Statues the honour of being the only two of the seven recorded, that have lived to be the wonders of the modern world. I climbed to the top of the first pyramid in 1843, and 1852, and 1885, and to the top of the second in 1843, and entered both in 1843 and 1885. All the world may have advanced, but there was no change there: the perfection of their architecture, and design, indicate a long period of previous culture: no barbarous nation of Asia or Africa could have erected\nsuch an enduring trophy, for there is no reason to calculate any period for their decay. Abraham must have looked at them, when he visited Memphis in the XII. Dynasty; Joseph and Moses must have known them well; the great Egyptian Kings of the XVIII. Dynasty could erect nothing so magnificent, and so enduring: how tiny and insignificant seem the Temple of Solomon and Zerubbabel, or even Balbek, when brought into comparison! Nothing has survived, or ever came into existence in Europe or Asia, which can contend with them the honour of being the mightiest trophy of human enterprise. They have escaped the danger of earthquake, lightning, sieges, and floods, and insidious decay by lapse of years, and their materials have escaped the greed of Monarchs requiring stone for new buildings. Rome and Athens have been less fortunate.\n\nIn Chapter VI. the Professor describes the first four Dynasties of the Kings of Egypt, who belong to the Theban Period. This brings us down to the period of the Invasion of the Semitic Shepherds, and the date of Joseph's power in Egypt. Up to that time the Kings of Egypt may have warred with the tribes in the Deserts on both sides of them, or with Nubia to the South, but they were destined soon to come into collision with a great Power, which had risen up in Mesopotamia: both were proud, strong, and highly civilized.\n\nChapters VII., VIII., and IX. relate to Chald\u00e6a, and will not be noticed on this occasion: Egypt found a formidable rival in Mesopotamia, and eventually a succession of Persian, Greek, and Roman, Conquerors before the date of the Christian era, which accomplished the destruction of her independence and further development. In conversation in the Persian language with the ex-Khedive Ishmail Pasha, during his residence in England, I remarked, \"barai Misr hechak umed n\u00e9st,\" \"for Egypt there is no hope at all,\" and this is my deliberate opinion, and the same remark applies to Turkey and Greece: they have had their day.\n\nTo those, who like myself, have had the privilege during\nthe last twenty years of studying this great subject, and of repeatedly visiting the country during the last fifty years, this book has peculiar fascinations. I attended the Linguistic Classes, which were formed in London for the study of Egyptian Hieroglyphics, and at different Capitals in Europe, London, St. Petersburg, Berlin, Vienna, and Stockholm, and also at Florence and Leyden, I listened to communications made on the general subject of Egypt by such men as Lepsius, Brugsch, Renouf, Birch, Lieblein, Pleyte, Reinisch, Gol\u00e9nischaf, and Maspero himself, on the occasion of the great International Oriental Congresses. I have followed with appreciative interest the occasional narratives of such travellers and explorers as Sayce, Petrie, Naville, Villiers-Stuart, Amelia Edwards, and in far off years of Col. Vyse, whose person I recollect in my Eton days. I have referred to the standard-works of the past by Champollion, Young, Champollion Figeau, Rosellini, Chabas, Lenormant, De Roug\u00e9, Wilkinson, Piehl, De Morgan, Lane, Grebaut, Rossi, Lef\u00e9bure, Goodwin, Reinisch, D\u00fcmichen, Ebers, Stern, Eisenlohr, Revillont, Erman, and Pierret. On no subject has there been such a galaxy of magnificent scholars: the subject was worthy of the highest scholarship, and the scholars have proved themselves worthy of the subject: there has been enough difference of opinion to stimulate closer inquiry, and yet enough of unity amidst scholars of different nationalities and antecedents to justify the conviction, that the right road has been found.\n\nThis magnificent volume, compiled with such skill, and breadth of view, and translated so sweetly and accurately, is, as it were, a codification, or general conspectus, of the knowledge of Egyptology up to the fin du si\u00e8cle XIX.: there are discoveries still to be made: the twentieth century has secrets to unfold, but it does not seem probable, that it will shake the foundation of our present arch\u00e6ological beliefs, though it may modify them and add to them.\n\nJan. 1895. R. N. Cust.\nThe Student's Gujar\u0101ti Grammar. By G. P. Taylor, M.A., B.D. Irish Presbyterian Mission, Gujar\u0101t.\n\nThe author of this work states in his Preface that he publishes it in the hope of providing a manual that will exhibit the main facts and principles of Gujar\u0101ti Grammar in a form intelligible to anyone of average English education, and that his constant endeavour has been to secure accuracy and simplicity, not novelty. The book is specially addressed to those who are in want of a grammar to read before going to the country of which Gujar\u0101ti is the vernacular language. Mr. Taylor must excuse us when, from a practical knowledge of Gujar\u0101ti extending over many years, we are of opinion that in the matter of simplicity he has entirely failed in his object, and that, so far from enabling a beginner to study the language without the aid of a native munshi, the former would, in the generality of cases, be utterly bewildered and lose himself in the maze of infinitesimal hair-splitting distinctions in form which the author has provided for the assimilation of the unaccustomed student, and would be apt to despair of ever acquiring a tongue placed before him in such an uninviting and portentous shape. The book is really more of the nature of a philological analysis of the Gujar\u0101ti language, useful to advanced scholars, than a grammar to be put into the hands of beginners. Otherwise, with the exception of an absence of allusion to words and idiomatical expressions peculiar to different parts of the country in which Gujar\u0101ti is spoken, for it must be remembered that its range is from far to the north of Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d throughout the Peninsula of K\u0101thi\u0101v\u0101r well down to the south near Bombay, the work is learned, and the analysis thoroughly and conscientiously worked out.\n\nBefore proceeding to offer a few remarks on the grammar itself, it will be as well to point out for the benefit of the\nSurat Mission Press that sufficient distinction is not made in the type between the letter sa (\u0ab8) and the syllable rd (\u0ab0\u0acd), which are thus apt to be mistaken for each other. It should also be noticed that in ordinary Gujar\u0101ti handwriting, although the characters used are much the same as those of the printed type, a line is drawn along the page and the letters are written underneath. This has the advantage of keeping the lines of writing tolerably even, and of enabling similar letters to be distinguished from each other, e.g. \u0aa7 dha and \u0a98 gha, the former being partly above the line and the latter below it. Another respect in which the written differs from the printed character is that the former does not follow the practice of the Devan\u0101gar\u012b in placing i (\u0902) before the letter after which it is pronounced, or in affixing r (\u0903) above the letter before which it comes: for instance, the word visarg in page 9, line 1, printed \u0ab5\u0abf\u0ab8\u0ab0\u0acd\u0a97, would in manuscript be \u0ab5\u0abf\u0ab8\u0ab0\u0acd\u0a97.\n\nThis symbol \"visarg\" is seldom or never used in the written character, and it would only be a pedantic purist who would think of writing for pain (at the end of para. 5) the word \u0aaa\u0abe\u0aa8; it would be simply \u0aaa\u0abe\u0aa8, for, pace the author, the visarg has no audible sound at all, and the word would be pronounced in English simply as dookh. As the Hunterian system of transliteration of Oriental letters has been finally adopted, it is a pity that it has not been strictly adhered to in this book.\n\nPassing on to the rules laid down for the gender of nouns\u2014it is admitted that the gender can be learned only through constant practice, but there is more in the matter than this. A noun considered feminine in Ahmad\u0101b\u0101d may be masculine in Surat and neuter in K\u0101thi\u0101v\u0101r (Kattywar), and vice versa. A good deal depends on whether the origin of the word was Persian (or Hindust\u0101ni) or Sanskrit (or one of the dialects descended from the latter), the rule in some parts of the country being that the gender in Gujar\u0101ti\nshould follow that of the original language, and in others that it should be that assigned to it by common custom. The general rules laid down for distinguishing gender are, with this exception, correct, but some of the distinctions drawn are unnecessarily fine: for instance, it would have been far simpler to omit the exceptions to the femininity of nouns ending in \\(i\\) (\\(i\\)) in para. 12, with the remark that those thus ending, when belonging to individuals evidently of the male sex, should be treated as masculine, notwithstanding their feminine termination. Another instance of the hair-splitting, so puzzling and laboured to beginners, indulged in by the author is in para. 13, where it is said that should an inanimate object have a name ending in \\(a\\) or \\(e\\), and an object of the like kind a name ending in \\(y\\), the former is generally the larger, stronger, coarser of the two, and the latter the smaller, weaker, finer. This is in reality by no means the case. In one of the instances given, \\(a\\) \u201ca cart,\u201d \\(a\\) \u201ca carriage,\u201d the latter may be a heavy clumsy cart with wooden wheel tires, and the former a light carriage on springs, the gender used depending simply on the speaker\u2019s fancy. Among the different words used for the masculine and feminine of the noun representing the same person we notice \\(a\\), given as \u201ca bride,\u201d the feminine of \\(a\\), \u201ca bridegroom,\u201d but the former really means a virgin, although applied to a bride; again, \\(a\\) is given as the feminine equivalent to \\(a\\), \u201ca male buffalo,\u201d but \\(a\\) might just as well be used. Another curious misconception is apparent in giving \\(a\\) (\\(ch\u0101k\\)) as a vernacular name for \u201cchalk,\u201d whereas it is simply a corruption of the English word itself.\n\nThere is no fault to find with the paragraphs relating to adjectives and their declension, but in the sentence quoted at the end, \u201cHis nephew asked some money from him,\u201d the word \\(a\\) would ordinarily be \\(a\\) (not \\(bhatr\u012bj\u0113\\), but \\(bhatr\u012bj\u0113\\)).\nWith regard to the pronouns, the author remarks that the forms are found chiefly, though not solely, in poetry. In an experience of over thirty years in all parts of the Province, and in the course of communication with all classes of people, the present writer has never known them used in prose\u2014a very good proof of their rarity. The same remarks apply to the form of the 2nd personal pronoun. In this chapter there is a remarkable omission of the 3rd personal pronoun, \"he, she, or it,\" the only notice taken of its existence being in the following para., viz. \"The demonstrative pronoun is also used as the 3rd personal pronoun, 'he, she, it.'\" It is, however, the 3rd personal pronoun first, and demonstrative pronoun in the second place only, and with its plural (t\u0113o) is regularly declined as substantives are. The author has also omitted to give the alternative forms of and which follow the Hindust\u0101ni, and are commonly used, viz. and , as well as the variations in the inflected cases of , such as for .\n\nThe definitions of the various tenses and parts of verbs appear to be unnecessarily complicated for beginners, although they may be linguistically correct. It is advisable to warn the student that he will in ordinary handwriting not find inserted in the past tenses the (ye), carefully used by the author: for instance, , chadyo \"he rose,\" would be so written, and not , as in this grammar. The distinction between the 1st and 2nd perfect participles drawn in the note on page 51 is without a difference, that formed with an inserted (l), being more or less frequent in different parts of the country, and being specially common in K\u0101thi\u0101v\u0101r, where such words as are often used uninflected.\n\nIn the rules for the present and past indefinite subjunctive tenses the particle is prefixed to the pronoun and verb, but it is as common to say and .\nas \u0928\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0926\u0947\u0936\u0915 and \u0928\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0926\u0947\u0936\u0915. The form of adding \u0905\u093f to the termination of the word, as in \u0905\u0928\u0941\u092d\u0935\u093f and \u0917\u0943\u0939\u093f\u0924\u093f is not by any means so unusual as the author would appear to think. With regard to the subjunctive compound tenses of intransitive verbs (para. 61), it is necessary to point out that they are seldom or never used without their appropriate pronouns: for instance, \u0905\u0928\u0941\u092d\u0935\u093f \u0917\u0943\u0939\u093f\u0924\u093f is generally \u0924\u0947 \u0905\u0928\u0941\u092d\u0935\u093f \u0917\u0943\u0939\u093f\u0924\u093f. Sufficient notice has not been taken of the common idiomatical use of the verb \u091a\u0941\u0915\u093f, \u201cto become or be\u201d: for instance, no native would think of translating \u201cGood luck to you\u201d by \u0924\u093e\u0901\u0938\u0947 \u091a\u0941\u0915\u093f \u092f\u093e\u092e\u093f, as at the close of para. 63, the proper idiomatical rendering being \u0924\u093e\u0901\u0938\u0947 \u091a\u0941\u0915\u093f \u092f\u093e\u092e\u093f. If one wished to ask how many koss it was to a place, moreover, one would not say \u0915\u093f\u0924\u0928\u093e \u0906\u092a\u093f \u0939\u094b\u0924\u093f or \u0939\u094b\u0924\u093f \u0913, but \u0915\u093f\u0924\u0928\u093e \u0906\u092a\u093f \u0925\u093e\u092e\u093f. The rule given for forming the precative mood, viz. by adding \u0905\u093f to the verbal stem, may be good grammar, but in ordinary parlance the sentences given would be as follows:\n\n\u0924\u093e\u0901\u0938\u0947 \u0930\u093e\u091c\u094d\u092f \u0906\u092a\u093f, not \u0906\u092a\u093f \u201cThy kingdom come.\u201d\n\u092f\u0941 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093f \u0925\u093e\u092e\u093f, not \u0925\u093e\u092e\u093f \u201cMayest thou be accursed!\u201d\n\nIn place of making a separate class (para. 81) of intensive compound verbs, only to puzzle a beginner, would it not be simpler to say the verbs \u091a\u0941\u0915\u093f, \u0905\u0928\u0941\u092d\u0935\u093f, \u0930\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f, etc., may be combined with past participles of other verbs, to give the latter an intensive sense? For instance, \u0928\u093e\u0938\u0940 \u0905\u0928\u0941\u092d\u0935\u093f, to reach after flight, to effect one\u2019s escape, is literally \u201chaving fled away, to come\u201d; \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f \u0930\u093e\u091c\u094d\u092f\u093f, to keep hold of, is \u201chaving seized to keep\u201d; \u0928\u093e\u0938\u0940 \u0930\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f, to bear on, to endure, is \u201chaving endured to remain.\u201d The completive compound verbs under B, para. 62, might well have come under the same heading, instead of the beginner being puzzled with an extra one, and the same remark is almost equally applicable to the subsequent paras. headed Frequentative Compound Verbs, Continuative Compound Verbs, and Obligative Compound Verbs. All the distinctions drawn\nmay be philologically correct, but are far too abstruse to puzzle a beginner with. The infinitival expressions in para. 91 are useful as showing some of the peculiar idioms of the language.\n\nThe paragraphs relating to adverbs need few remarks. It may be noticed in passing that \u0a8f\u0aa3 (para. 92) is derived from Persian, and not old Gujarati; that \u0a85\u0a82\u0a97\u0abe\u0aa3\u0ac1 means \"close to\" as well as \"almost\"; \u0aa4\u0abe\u0ab2\u0ac7\u0aa8\u0ac0 or \u0a9c\u0abe\u0aa3\u0ac0 ought to be added to \u0aa8\u0abf\u0aaf\u0acb in para. 93; \u0aa6\u0abf\u0ab5\u0ab8\u0aa6\u0ac7 \u0aa6\u0abf\u0ab5\u0ab8\u0ac7 to \u0aa6\u0abf\u0ab5\u0ab8 \u0aaa\u0ab0 \u0aa6\u0abf\u0ab5\u0ab8 (day after day) in para. 94; \u0a95\u0acd\u0ab7\u0ac7\u0aa4\u0acd\u0ab0 \u0aae\u0acb\u0ab0 (used especially in K\u0101thi\u0101v\u0101r) to \u0a85\u0a82\u0a97\u0abe\u0aa3\u0ac1 \u0aaa\u0abe\u0a9b\u0ab3, before and behind; and that \u0a8f\u0aa3 \u0aaf\u0ac1\u0a82, \"what then (will result)?\u201d unless written \u0a8f\u0aa3 \u0aaf\u0ac1\u0a82, would mean \u201cwhat is it to thee?\u201d instead of merely \u201cwhat then?\u201d\n\nAs this review has reached a greater length than was at first intended, we will only notice in conclusion some of the author's list of prepositions and the cases they govern.\n\n\u0a93\u0ab0 and \u0a97\u0abe\u0aa8 \u201cin the direction of,\u201d etc., frequently become \u0a93\u0ab0\u0ac7 and \u0a97\u0abe\u0aa8\u0ac7. \u0a9a\u0abe\u0ab2\u0ac7 \u201csince (time) ago\u201d is not a preposition, but the 3rd person plural of the past tense of \u0a9a\u0abe\u0ab2\u0ac7, as \u0a9a\u0abe\u0ab2\u0ac7 \u0aaa\u0abe\u0a9b\u0ab3 \u0a9a\u0abe\u0ab2\u0ac7, \u201cthere have been ten years,\u201d or \u201cten years have passed since.\u201d \u0a93\u0ab0 is used with \u0aab\u0abe\u0a9f\u0abe\u0aa3\u0ac7 \u201cbefore, sooner than,\u201d as often as \u0aa8\u0ac0: \u0aa4\u0ac7\u0aae\u0abe\u0a82\u0aa5\u0ac0 \u201caccording to,\u201d etc., is as common as \u0aa4\u0ac7\u0aa8\u0abe \u0aaa\u0abe\u0a9b\u0ab3\u0ac7. Similarly with \u0aa4\u0ac7\u0aa8\u0ac0 \u0a9a\u0abe\u0ab2\u0ac7 and \u0aa4\u0ac7\u0aa8\u0ac0 \u0a9a\u0abe\u0ab2\u0ac7\u0aa8\u0ac7.\n\n\u0aa4\u0ac7\u0aa8\u0abe \u0a9a\u0abe\u0ab2\u0ac7\u0aa8\u0ac7 is not so common as \u0aa4\u0ac7\u0aa8\u0abe \u0a9a\u0abe\u0ab2\u0ac7 or \u0aa4\u0ac7\u0aa8\u0abe \u0a9a\u0abe\u0ab2\u0ac7\u0aa8\u0ac7.\n\nWith \u0a9a\u0abe\u0ab2\u0ac7, \u0a9a\u0abe\u0ab2\u0ac7\u0aa8\u0ac7, \u0ab8\u0a82\u0a9a\u0abe\u0ab2\u0ac7\u0aa8\u0ac7, \u0ab8\u0a82\u0a9a\u0abe\u0ab2\u0ac7, and \u0a9a\u0abe\u0ab2\u0ac7\u0aa8\u0ac7, the preceding noun or pronoun is frequently not inflected, as in the case of \u0a9a\u0abe\u0ab2\u0ac7\u0aa8\u0ac7 and \u0a9a\u0abe\u0ab2\u0ac7\u0aa8\u0ac7.\n\nEnough has been said to show that this grammar, though elaborated in a most painstaking manner, fails in that simplicity and absence of hair-splitting distinctions so essential to attract the favour of a beginner and ease his labours, and it is not too much to remark that it is essentially a work written by a person, like a Missionary,\nstationary in one particular place, and accustomed to associate with one set of people speaking in a similar way. It is not one by a person accustomed to move all over the Province, and is therefore not suitable to a student who desires a knowledge of the language as generally used. The variations in different parts of the country make the composition of a Gujar\u0101t\u012b grammar really a very difficult matter, but most of the faults pointed out are capable of easy correction in a second edition.\n\nA.

Paris: E. Leroux, 1894.\n\nUnder this unassuming title, the learned Director of the High School of Letters in Algiers has given us a treatise on Berber dialects, some forty of which are passed in review, wherein he has judiciously condensed the outcome of research up to date, most of it being the result of his own indefatigable industry. Here we find a piece of honest good work, a storehouse of linguistic lore, from which, however, the author is careful not to draw any deductions, general or special. Scrupulously refraining from indulging in speculations or inferences, he has been content to keep to the boundary line of facts, known and well pondered. Properly speaking, these \"Studies on Berber dialects\" may be termed a \"Comparative Grammar of the Berber dialects\"; still incomplete, undoubtedly\u2014so much the Professor candidly admits, and to which additions will have to be made hereafter, though we surmise that it will never be found necessary to excise any portions of the work, for the simple reason that the scholarly author has strictly kept within the bounds of established facts.\n\n1 See, f. i. pp. 59-63, the remarkable account of the development of the root F with the primitive meaning of \"light.\"\nWe can only counsel admirers of thorough efficiency to make an attentive study of this pioneer epitome, concise alike and luminous, of Berber philology, from which they will be sure to derive pleasure and profit!\n\nTH. G. DE GUIRAUDON.\n\nW\u00d6RTERBUCH DER BEDAUYE SPRACHE, von LEO REINISCH.\n8vo. Pp. 365. Wien : A. H\u00f6lder, 1895.\n\nI have had already the opportunity of noticing in this Journal the publication of original texts and of a remarkable grammar of this language by the same learned author. He has now completed his work on the subject by issuing an extensive dictionary, which by far surpasses all previous publications of various authors. The present dictionary is not a mere register of words with their German translation. Each word is carefully analyzed, as well by itself as with reference to cognate words in other languages of North-east Africa, already illustrated, or about to be illustrated, by the Viennese Professor. In fact, besides a well-known and masterly treatise on the Nubian language, Prof. Leo Reinisch has devoted himself to the study of the so-called Chamitic family of languages in North-east Africa, and he has published grammars and dictionaries, founded on original texts collected by himself on the spot with the utmost care, in the Barea, Bilin, Saho, Trob-Saho, Chamir, Guara, Kafa, Kunama, and Afar (or Dankali) languages, the whole being represented by nearly 5000 pages of 8vo print, and, indeed, 5000 pages of conscientious and genuine work. The Galla and Somali languages remain yet to be scientifically investigated: Schleicher, whose premature death is much to be regretted, besides having published a valuable grammar of the Somali language, had also collected many original texts in the two above-named languages: I understand that these texts have been fortunately preserved and forwarded to Prof. Leo Reinisch, who intends to use them as a sound basis for his future exertions. Thus, the series will be complete as far as this corner of\nAfrica is concerned, and, perhaps, we may be able to get some light from a comparative study of these languages and the Berber dialects: the names of Prof. Ren\u00e9 Basset and Leo Reinisch will then be connected for having jointly led the way into this field of research.\n\nTH. G. DE G.\n\nCHRESTOMATHY OF ARABIC PROSE-PIECES. By Dr. R. Br\u00fcnnow. (Porta linguarum orientalium, edidit Herm. L. Strack, pars xvi.) Pp. ix. and 311. London: Williams and Norgate, 1895.\n\nWith so many Arabic chrestomathies already in existence the appearance of yet another one might seem superfluous, but for the reasons given by the author in his preface the publication of this one is fully justified. The few pages of prose text, with the rather meagre glossary appended to Prof. Socin's Grammar, were hardly sufficient as reading exercise for beginners. It was felt long ago that the space they occupied should rather have been devoted to the extension of the grammatical portion of the book. The syntax in particular was so greatly curtailed that either the students were obliged to refer to a larger work or the lecturer had to make supplementary remarks to each paragraph. It is gratifying to learn, therefore, that a further edition of Prof. Socin's work will be considerably enlarged. To accomplish this satisfactorily the Chrestomathy must be detached, and the publishers have done well to place the compilation of the latter in such excellent hands as those of Dr. Br\u00fcnnow. The pieces have been selected with great discrimination. Dr. Br\u00fcnnow wisely endeavoured to provide readers with an abridged history of early Islamism compiled from the most popular authors, as Ibn Quteiba, Al-Mas\u02bf\u016bdi, Ibn Abd Rabbihi, and others. The Adab is represented by some specimens of Kit\u0101b-al-Agh\u0101ni, whilst the S\u016bras 1, 28, and 81 give an idea of the style of the Qor\u0101n in the Meccan epoch. The edition of the whole of the Ajurr\u016bmiyya is sure to meet with general\napproval, as the little book forms a most suitable introduction into the study of the more difficult works on grammar.\n\nThe completeness of the glossary is somewhat impaired by the bilingual translation of every paragraph, although the smaller type makes up to a certain degree for the loss of space. Two very useful appendices form a welcome addition to the book. The one contains the genealogies of the Quraishites, showing the lines of descendants in the families which generated the Prophet and the chief Moslim dynasties. The second is a chronological table, giving the principal dates in the history of Isl\u0101m as far as the Abbassides.\n\nThis new Arabic Chrestomathy will, no doubt, soon be as popular as most of the works of the Portes.\n\nH.

With Preface by Dr. Vollers, pp. 7, 136, and 127.\n\nThe short preliminary notice which appeared in the April number of this Journal last year was hardly adequate to the importance of the publication in question. A few additional remarks will, therefore, not be superfluous. Hitherto the work has been looked upon as lost, but the two parts (iv. and v.) lying before us in print are in so far complete, as they contain the description of the whole of Egypt, whereas the remaining volumes, if they had ever been written, would have been devoted to other centres of Moslim culture. The autograph MS. of the work from which the edition was made had for centuries been lying forgotten in a mosque. It was not only fortunate that it was\nrecovered at all, but that it fell in the hands of a scholar of European training and of such efficiency as Dr. Vollers. The importance of the publication speaks for itself, even if we only glance at it, and is enhanced by the circumstance, so clearly evidenced in the preface, that Maqrizi was unaware of its existence. It gives a detailed description of the author's fatherland as it was at the beginning of the fourteenth century. The richness of its contents can be gathered from the following brief list of items it treats of. It describes the streets, places, quarters, gates, passages, markets, squares, barracks, porticos, hills, ponds, mosques, medresses, public baths, churches, synagogues, monasteries, etc. The descriptions are accompanied by historical accounts, often going back as far as the rise of Moslim power.\n\nThe author set to work in a very methodical way, dividing the country in a northern and a southern part. He commences with an account of the foundation of Fost\u00e2t, even mentioning traditions connected with it. It is no wonder that this oldest portion of Cairo nearly monopolises the first volume. That the mosques occupy a considerable space, is not surprising. A very interesting chapter is devoted to the canal which was made to receive the overflow of the Nile. The description of Fost\u00e2t is followed by one of the neighbouring villages and the island of R\u014ddha. The second volume describes Al-Q\u0101hira, Damiette, Alexandria, and other places. This part has unfortunately many gaps. The historians on whom Ibn Duqm\u0101q relies are mentioned in the preface, with the exception of Ibn Quteiba. Apart from its historical value, the book is also of linguistic interest, and Dr. Vollers has not failed to call due attention to this. The print is unfortunately small and too cramped. The addition of an index would have been an improvement. Gratitude is due both to Dr. Vollers for the careful execution, and the Egyptian Government for the promotion, of the important book, of which a translation would be gladly welcomed.\n\nH. Hirschfeld.\nDIARY OF A JOURNEY THROUGH MONGOLIA AND TIBET IN 1891 AND 1892. By WILLIAM WOODVILLE ROCKHILL, Gold Medallist of the Royal Geographical Society. (City of Washington: published by the Smithsonian Institution), 1894.\n\n\"The journey described in this volume,\" we read in the \"Advertisement\" prefixed to it, \"was undertaken by Mr. Rockhill partly under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution, and the work is issued as a special publication of the Institution, with the general object of 'increasing and diffusing knowledge' in regard to the little known countries traversed by the explorer.\"\n\nAn introductory notice by the author gives us a short chronological account of the travellers who have visited Tibet, and this is followed by a statement of the circumstances which led the author to take the particular course of exploration described in his book.\n\nThe work itself is in the form of a diary, the writer giving under each day the record not only of his journey but also of his observations, reflections, hopes, apprehensions, and projects. This form of writing will not be found to be, as Mr. Rockhill seems to have feared it might be, tedious to any serious reader. It rather gives a freshness and reality to the narrative, and it also enables the reader to break his reading at convenient intervals.\n\nMr. Rockhill starts on his travels from Peking, having obtained from the Chinese authorities there a passport authorizing him \"to visit Kansu, Ss\u00fc-ch'uan, Y\u00fcn-nan, Hsin-chiang (the New Dominion), and the Ching-hai, or the Mongol and Tibetan country, under the administrative control of the Hsi-ning Amban.\" From Peking the traveller proceeded by the Nan-K'ou Pass, the road through which he found \"wonderfully improved\" since his visit in 1888, on to Kalgan. Here he equipped himself with a supply of travelling necessaries, and then went on to Kuei-hua-Ch'eng. From this he continued his journey to Ning-hsia-foo, on the Yellow River in Kansu, a place\nwhich produces good paper and woollen rugs of great repute among the Chinese.\n\nFrom Ning-hsia Mr. Rockhill proceeded south-west to the great city of Lan-chow-foo, where he stayed a few days, visiting the European missionaries and perfecting his equipment. As an example of the interesting and valuable information to be found in this book, and of the clear simple style in which the author writes, we may take the following passage from his account of his stay at Lan-chow-foo:\n\n\"Opium cultivation and opium smoking are increasing at a rapid rate. At Liang-chow, for example, they count eight lamps (yen t\u00e9ng) for every ten persons; here at Lan-chow it is nearly as bad. It would be wrong to imagine that the native Kansuites are responsible for the increased consumption of opium; it is a result of the rapid and overwhelming influx of Ss\u00fc-ch\u2018uanese into the province. I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that they form a fifth of the whole population of Kansu; in the southern portions they are much more numerous than elsewhere, around Hui-hsien, and the warmer and more fertile districts especially. They take the trade, wholesale and retail, and have energy, the one essential thing the Kansuites are lacking in. There are three or four Ch\u2018an-t\u2018ou (Turkestanis) here selling raisins, rugs, etc., and also seven or eight Koreans with ginseng. These latter people visit the remotest corners of China. In 1889 there was one at Ta-chien-lu, where he kept an inn\" (p. 56).\n\nFrom Lan-chow Mr. Rockhill proceeded in a north-west direction on to Hsi-ning and Lusar, and thence by Shang, south of the Koko Nor and Tsai-dam, through Mongolian territory to Naichi Gol. From this he continued his journey south and south-west on to Namru, near the Tengri Nor. From this last he had to turn and proceed in an easterly direction to Batang, and so on into western Ss\u00fc-ch\u2018uan and down the Yang-ts\u00fc to Shanghai.\n\nIn his long journey, especially in the part of it which lay in Tibetan territory, Mr. Rockhill had often to endure great hardships, encounter many difficulties, and bear\nserious disappointment. His troubles are told in a plain unvarnished narrative, and he never dwells on them too long, nor writes of them with undue asperity.\n\nThe present treatise is a worthy supplement to the author's \"Land of the Lamas.\" It gives many items of curious and interesting information about remote and little known places in parts of the Mongolian and Tibetan dependencies of China. It abounds also in thoughtful, sensible comments on the social and political state of affairs in these districts. One illustration must suffice. When at Draya, near the Gamla in Tibet, the traveller was treated with great rudeness by a party of drunken rowdy Lamas. The Chinese military officer stationed in the town could easily have dispersed the mischievous rioters and protected the traveller's party, but he did not give the least assistance. Mr. Rockhill hereupon remarks: \"It was quite in keeping with what I have now found out to be Chinese policy in this country, for neither the Shou-pei (the Chinese military officer of the town) nor any of his subordinates to turn up in this emergency. The Chinese in Tibet do not want to risk their popularity with the dominant class of the country (i.e. the Lamas) by befriending foreigners, to do which they would have to assert their authority without any advantage to themselves. Whenever China sees the necessity of doing so, it can effectually assert its supremacy in Tibet, for it is absurd to say that China is not the sovereign power there, and that Chinese officials are only there to manage their own people, and are tolerated, as it were, in the country. History, since the time of Kanghsi, or Ch'ien-lung at all events, and also recent events at Lh'asa and along the Indian border, prove conclusively that this is not so; but China does not propose to hold Tibet by force of arms\u2014the game would hardly be worth the candle; it is by diplomacy, by its superior knowledge of foreign affairs and nations, and by conciliating the Lamas, that it preserves its undoubted sway\" (p. 324).\n\nThe \"Diary of a journey\" is well illustrated, and it is furnished with an excellent general index and a route\nmap of the traveller's explorations. There are also five appendices, the first giving a Salar vocabulary, the second a San-ch'uan T'u-jen vocabulary, the third giving a list of plants of Tibet by Mr. W. Botting Hemsley, the fourth giving a table of altitudes, latitudes, etc., and the fifth giving the mean monthly temperature from June to October, 1892.\n\nT. W.\n\nPersische Studien, von H. H\u00fcbschmann. Strassburg: Karl J. Tr\u00fcbner, 1895.\n\nProfessor H\u00fcbschmann, of Strassburg, has long been known for his excellent work in the field of Indo-Germanian Philology, and especially for his Armenian researches, for he was the first to clearly demonstrate that Armenian was not an Iranian language, as was formerly maintained by most scholars, and still is by some. In his Persian studies he gives a clear exposition of the point at present reached in the etymology of modern Persian. The work is divided into two parts. The first part, comprising some 120 pages, is devoted to a critical examination of Dr. Horn's Grundriss der Neupersischen Etymologie; the second, to the principal rules of Persian etymology. In his preface to the first part the author, in a measure, defends Dr. Horn against some of his too severe critics, at the same time fully recognizing that the book, partly from a lack of requisite material and partly from over-haste in its execution, leaves much to be desired. Professor H\u00fcbschmann has not taken upon himself to correct all the mistakes in Dr. Horn's Grundriss, nor to complete the collection of words. He has merely dealt with such words as specially interested him. The second part is prefaced by a clear, if brief, description of the relationship of ancient Persian to the Indo-Germanian Grundsprache, and the succeeding stages in the development of the modern language are sketched out. The method of treatment is most lucid. Each letter of old Persian is taken separately, and we are\nshown what became of it in its transition into the modern language. Every rule is amply illustrated by examples. Thus, for instance, we are shown that the \\(d\\) in ancient Persian is represented in modern Persian by \\(d\\), \\(h\\), or \\(y\\), and when \\(r\\) precedes it, by \\(l\\). Of each case many examples are given, such as\u2014dad \u201cjustice\u201d=old Persian d\u0101ta; daham \u201cgive,\u201d from da\u1e0d\u0101mi; mai=Zend ma\u1e0du; n\u0101lidan \u201clament\u201d=Sanskrit nard, and rules are given showing under what circumstances the various changes take place. Most important is the help which the author derives from Armenian in tracing old forms of Persian words, for Armenian abounds in words which it has borrowed, at different periods, direct from Persian; and in many cases it is quite possible to determine at what period such and such a word was taken into the language. For example, in early classical Armenian there was a fixed law that the vowels \\(i\\) and \\(u\\) disappeared when not in the last syllable. This law influenced all the Persian words borrowed at that period, while in later Armenian the newly-borrowed words, being no longer subject to this law, the Persian words become less disfigured in the process of adoption. Thus we find, on the one hand, the Armenian dmak \u201ctail,\u201d Zend duma, Persian dum; while, as an example of a later loan, Armenian pursishn \u201cprocess,\u201d from Pehlevi pursishn, Persian pursish \u201cquestion.\u201d In Armenian we find the modern Persian b\u0101s\u016b \u201carm\u201d under the form of bazuk, which clearly points to a Pehlevi for b\u0101st\u016bk, not b\u0101s\u014dk. This is one instance out of many cases in which Armenian enables us to decide upon the pronunciation of older forms of Persian words. The material for these studies have been derived from various sources, chiefly from Dr. Horn\u2019s collection. In several cases new light has been thrown upon old words by the very interesting description of an old Commentary to the Koran, published a short while ago by Mr. Browne in this Journal. The author has also utilized to great advantage the Afghan Dictionaries, which Dr. Horn seems to have disregarded in his Grundrisse.\n\nWhat is so much needed for the advancement of Persian\nstudies are careful editions of old texts, collections of peculiar words and forms occurring in the Sh\u0101hn\u0101ma (such as is now being undertaken by Professor N\u00f6ldeke), and in other old classics. Standard texts, like the Gulistan, have been edited and translated times without number, but our libraries are full of really old texts which have never been touched. What has been done in this line up to the present has, however, been fully utilized, and to the best advantage, in this excellent work of Prof. H\u00fcbschmann's.\n\nE. D. R.\n\nAn Introduction to the Study of Hinduism. By Guru Prosad Sen. Calcutta: Thacker, Spink, and Co.\n\nMr. Guru Prosad Sen's book, like that of many other cultivated Hindus in their present stage, reminds one forcibly of the aspect of some of their great towns, where palaces and hovels stand side by side. We find high aspirations and some really noble thoughts grouped incongruously with feeble common-places and flimsy reasonings, such as might be expected from a rather ambitious undergraduate. Yet, on the whole, this \"Introduction to the Study of Hinduism\" justifies its title. It opens up an approach to the subject which was hardly available before, and in its very method and style presents an instructive picture of the new Hindu striving hard and generously, if not quite successfully, as an apostle and a vindicator demonstrating how in religion and philosophy and toleration and civic capacity his people are leaders of mankind, yet bidding them \"whenever changes spring up... to try to mould and adopt them as fast as they can\" in such wise as to \"work out a harmonious whole, the like of which does not yet exist in this world.\"\n\nMr. Guru Prosad Sen boldly maintains that \"Hinduism is not, and has never been, a religious organization. It is a pure[ly] social system, insisting in [i.e. exacting from] those who are Hindus the observance of certain social forms,\nand not the profession of particular religious beliefs.\u201d The Hindu, he declares, \u201cmay choose to have a faith and creed, if he wants a creed, or do without one.\u201d It has long been recognized that Hindu feeling tolerated great latitude of speculative thought, so long as no attack was made on definite developed institutions. The mere co-existence of innumerable castes necessitates mutual forbearance. But when our author says that Hinduism is \u201can essentially progressive system,\u201d which \u201ctakes in and assimilates, hates to imitate, but beautifully incorporates, and makes new ideas its own by going onward with the impetus generated by these shocks,\u201d he translates the wish overmuch into the thought. Movements there have been and are, but is the body of Hindu philosophy advanced what it was left by Shankarach\u0101rya? It has, apparently, a great power of suppression or reabsorption. The Buddhism and Jainism which Mr. Sen regards as foreign influences were themselves evolved out of the early creative speculation of the post-Vedic philosophers, and were as national influences subdued or swallowed up again when their first energies were worn out. There is a tendency, apparently, rather to revert to old types than to take on new variations as permanent characteristics.\n\nIn religion Mr. Sen says that \u201cso long as a man holds to his caste he is at liberty to hold any opinions he likes, even to accepting the doctrines of Christianity.\u201d He may accept the doctrines perhaps, but can he adopt the practices of Christianity? And, however it may be with Hinduism, Christianity insists on a mode of life, a relation to one\u2019s fellow-men, which is quite incompatible with the retention of caste and the observance of caste rules. The same may be said of Mahomedanism. From either point of view the Hindu who, having embraced doctrines inconsistent with caste, remains in caste must be irreligious and a hypocrite. His subservience to a system which he must see or think hampers the full development of the individual man is worse, as a matter of progress, than his sincere adherence to a creed, even though a defective one, and a self-denying,\nuntiring endeavour to live up to it. If then the central essential characteristic of the Hindu is caste, he is not as a Hindu either \"intensely religious\" or progressive in any practical sense. He dreams of better things, but does them not.\n\nOn the subject of Hindu family life Mr. Sen has many instructive remarks from the standpoint of intimacy which only a Hindu can attain. He rejects, and not without reason, Maine's theory of the simpler forms of family being derived, historically, from the more complex. \"The earliest Vedic type of family was the simple, or individual, type, consisting only of the man, his wife, and children.\" This type was the ideal one long after the Vedic times, and partition is commended by Gautama as augmenting the sum of spiritual merit through the multiplication of separate household sacrifices according to the archaic fashion. The rights of the widow and daughter, though postponed, to those of the sons took precedence of the rights of brothers to the estate of a man deceased. The \"joint family,\" so called, was of later growth. It suited the special conditions of life to which Hindu society was for some centuries subjected, but it is fading away again under the impulse to individualism received from contact with European civilization. Mr. Sen thinks that economy was the motive which first induced Hindus to form large joint families, embracing numerous first and even second cousins in a single group. Yet, again, he says: \"The first splitting up of the complex family type in this country appears to have been due to the growing poverty of the people.\" And, after all, \"it will primarily be a desire for cheapness again which under better conditions and better education will recommend the second and third types to our people and perpetuate them as Indian types.\" It is hard to see how all these statements can be correct. In the Vedic era the Aryan youth had an almost boundless field of activity. \"The world was all before them where to choose.\" In the present day an equally wide field of industrial and commercial enterprise has been opened up under British\nrule. Individualism, independent life and exertion, is stimulated by such circumstances. Between the first stage and the last came a long period of comparative stagnation. Employments being more and more rigidly regulated, the attractions drawing men away from the family hearth, and on which material progress depends, grew feebler and feebler. The general sense of helplessness favoured an effeminate cleaving to the family union, and kindly natural attachments grew into legal bonds. These bonds have become almost insufferable in the present day: the tendency to partition amongst brethren becomes greater and greater, and there is no more probability of the Hindus reverting to the great joint family as a general social scheme than of Europeans resuming the guild system of the fourteenth century.\n\nAll who are in any way familiar with Hindu society must have been struck with the docile, cheerful meekness of the softer sex. They take a purely subordinate, dependent position as an ordinance of Heaven, and thus find a happiness in single-minded acceptance of the lot assigned them, which their more aspiring sisters in Europe might envy. Mr. Sen, with a pardonable exaggeration, thinks they present the most perfect existing type of womankind. \"Our men,\" he declares, \"are immeasurably below our women.\" He even praises the discipline of the mother-in-law, whose harsh rule, according to common notions, is so intolerable to the child-wife. The shrewd Marathas, at any rate, take a very different view. The injusta noverca may indeed be a necessary element of the family so long as the wife enters on her career while still of tender years; but a reform which shall make marriage a matter of choice between adults will no doubt imply, or produce, a dethronement of the mother-in-law, similar to that which she has suffered in Europe. A young woman should not assume the functions of a wife until she is fitted for the control of a household. Her husband should not willingly see her aught but supreme in her own sphere. Without a character and a will of her own, however\ntempered and moulded by a sense of duty and a craving for unity with her husband, she can hardly be a worthy companion of a resolute, striving man, nor can she stamp her sons through daily, hourly influence with the true impress of manliness, which so many Englishmen preserve amid all their sins of sensuality and selfishness.\n\nMr. Sen insists, and rightly, on the practice by Hindu ladies\u2014the resumption as he views it\u2014of a more vigorous physical existence. \"There is no provision whatever,\" he says, \"for the young woman taking any healthy exercise.\" An almost universal slipshod listlessness is the natural consequence. Young women must not even cultivate a garden. \"Public opinion bans this; public opinion bans music; public opinion bans the presence of the young housewives before their fathers-in-law, and even their talking with the old women of the family.\" \"There is also a bar to the wife appearing before the husband in the presence of the elder male members of the family.\" There is no family meal in common. Such habits and practices betoken a state of feeling amongst the men which they must wholly shake off before the women can really become the paragons which they already seem to Mr. Sen's affectionate eyes. The idea of spiritual association, of personal equality, must be honestly and fervently embraced in order to create a standard to which the women, always disposed to look upward, will then most willingly conform. There is a latent grossness in some of the social rules that Mr. Sen enumerates which must be banished from the popular thought ere the Hindus, even of the higher classes, can make their women noble ladies, through first themselves becoming chivalrous, high-minded gentlemen.\n\nWhen this great reform, springing from within, has been accomplished and incorporated in the people's habits and character, the essential moral element of a new and noble nationality will have come into existence. The practical element must be gained rather through discipline in local affairs than through a thirst for high places and high functions, for which a fitness arises only here and there\namongst a community steeped to the lips in civic traditions and civic feeling. Mr. Sen, like most of his countrymen, looks on the institutions of self-government rather as a means of national and political progress than as the fruit and crown of such progress painfully achieved through manifold reactions of circumstance and tendency. Yet history affords no warrant for such a view. It everywhere presents us with high development as necessarily \"moved through life of lower phase,\" and in India the traditions and influences of three thousand years or so are not to be shaken off in a day or a generation. Its people cannot say, \"Go to: we will be a nation,\" for to be a nation implies an accepted and characteristic set of ideas, tastes, and sympathies. It is not constituted by a mere chance agglomeration of a multitude of human beings. It implies a constitution, co-ordination, a particular set of relations amongst classes and individuals. This complex organism, if it is to have life and activity, must rest on a million lower local organisms. It is in and through these that the Hindu, like the Englishman, will have to find that self-government is in a large measure self-renunciation, and to learn how widely the art of politics differs from high-flown theories and ambitions. In the meantime Hindu and Englishman alike may find in Mr. Sen's book indications both of great wants and of great capacities which invite and will reward energetic and sympathetic cooperation on both sides towards the achievement of an ever closer approach to assimilation in a generous, forbearing, far-reaching imperial spirit.\n\nR. W.\n\nThe Indus Delta Country.\u00b9 By Major-General M. Haig. London: Kegan Paul & Co., 1894.\n\nThe late Sir Richard Burton, more than forty years ago, expressed the opinion that little remained to be said on the\n\n\u00b9 \"The Indus Delta Country.\" A Memoir chiefly on its Ancient Geography and History. By Major-General M. R. Haig, M.R.A.S. With Three Maps. (Kegan Paul & Co., 1894.)\ngeographical position of the Indus, inasmuch as \"the different opinions concerning its course in the days of Alexander, and the various arguments for and against the theory that its ancient channel was to the eastward of the present bed,\" had been \"discussed usque ad nauseam.\" General Haig, however, with characteristic industry, comes again to the investigation of the problem in a geographical and historical memoir, which is well worth the attentive consideration of those persons into whose hands it may chance to fall. In his own words, the treatise\u2014of which the first two chapters were written seven years ago\u2014\"pretends to be nothing more than a rough guide for those in Sindh, who, taking an interest in the past of a province, one of the poorest, and in its outward aspect the least lovely in India, care to seek out the relics of former ages, and trace for themselves some picture of the country as it was at different periods of its generally troubled history.\"\n\nBut General Haig has very much more wherewith to occupy his readers' attention than a description of the old easterly course of the Indus through the province of Sindh, on which Burton naturally laid especial stress. His nine chapters or divisions lay before us the Delta country as it is in our own times; as it was at the time of Alexander's expedition, in B.C. 325\u201326; as it was understood by later Greek writers, such as Agatharchides (probably B.C. 146), the author of the Periplus (A.D. 81\u201396), and Ptolemy of the Ptolemaic system (A.D. 120\u201350); and again as described by the yet more modern Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsang, and the Muhammadan historians or geographers up to the ninth century. A short chapter follows, treating of the light thrown upon the same tracts by writers in the tenth century, the honoured names of Ibn Haukil, Istakhri, and Mas'udi occurring among the cited authorities. The remaining four chapters bear the respective headings of\u2014\n\n(1) \"The Delta Country after the second Muhammadan Invasion of India\"; (2) \"The Portuguese in the Delta\"; (3) \"The Campaign of the Imperial Forces in Lower Sindh\nin 1591\u201392\"; and (4) \"Lower Sindh in the Modern Period.\"\n\nIt is both a dangerous and fascinating pursuit to seek, in the names of existing towns, villages, rivers, or sites, that affinity with ancient nomenclature which, when proven and confirmed, has a price above rubies for those who would connect the Present and the Past, and help onward the study of classical literature by the light of modern research. But so perverse is human nature that personal gratification at a supposed \"find\" is apt to demoralise the mind of the seeker, and cloud his appreciation of its real value. General Haig has wisely restricted the scope of his enquiries in this field. Had he passed on westward of Sonmi\u0101ni and the P\u016br 'Ali, the temptation would, perhaps, have been greater, and he might have had to grapple with problems such as Dean Vincent, or more recent expositors, have sought to solve in identifying Kochari with Kokala, Mal\u0101n with Malana, Kalmat with Kalama, Koppa with Kophas, and many other place-names now in use, with those of Alexander's chroniclers. His nearest approach to the vexata quaestio is to be found in the Appendices to his volume, notably that marked F, the basis of which is supplied by Colonel Holdich. On the present occasion we can do little more than allude to the subject, as a serious analysis is impracticable in a brief notice such as this.\n\nThe first word discussed is Krokala, which Haig thinks may have been the Greek way of writing Kakralo, but that Holdich attaches too much importance to the resemblance between the two names. Let us quote the text hereon:\n\n\"It has been discovered, I believe, by a gentleman in Lower Sindh that Kakralo means 'Land's End.' That may be the recondite meaning known to a learned few, but in the vulgar Sindhi tongue Kukro means 'a pebble,' and Kakralo, the adjective, means 'pebbly.' An island in the sea may, therefore, have very well had that name, and have been better entitled to it than a district in the Delta, where, south of the Bhag\u0101r Channel, I think pebbles are conspicuous by their absence. But Krokala may quite as\nwell represent something else. Sir H. Elliott thought it might have something to do with the *Kharuka*, a piratical tribe. At all events, it is certain that the district about Kar\u0101chi Bay was, at the time of this voyage, called, not *Kakr\u0101la* but *Sangada.* But the very common Persian *sang* (a stone) and the Sindhi *k\u0101kro* (a pebble) are words which, however, varying in sound, have one and the same meaning, while both of the languages drawn upon are familiar to the local ear. In any case, the above extract supplies a fair specimen of the perplexing nature of the identifications attempted. Later on, the discussion turns upon the modern *Manora* and the ancient *Morontobara*; and here we might invite attention to the existence of a site called, thirty odd years ago, *Morona*, or *Morona Hill*, which the present writer passed on his second march from Kar\u0101chi towards Gw\u0101dar. It is referred to in a footnote of his published diary, as \u201cnot improbably the Morontabara of Arrian, and found in Arrowsmith\u2019s ancient \u2018Atlas Imperii Persici.\u2019\u201d The *bara* may have something in common with the *bare*, which General Haig interprets, in its accented form *b\u0101ri*, to be an old Sindhi suffix to place-names, and which, unaccented, is found, according to Ptolemy and the Periplus, in \u201cLonibare,\u201d the name of one of the seven mouths of the Indus. *Bara* is elsewhere translated \u201ca roadstead.\u201d But Col. Holdich\u2019s *Morontabara* is close to the Arabis, far beyond the present *Morona*.\n\nTo retrace the original course of the main river, or to identify its former beds, is no simple process in a country of physical changes like Sindh; where the stream is ever capricious, and the so-called Rules of Alluvion and Diluvion are in such constant request. From year to year the J\u0101gird\u0101r, or holder of alienated land, becomes a gainer or loser of land, according to the action of the running waters, which may, on the one hand, add to his acres by uncovering and abandoning them, or, on the other hand, sweep them away by thoroughness of overflow. General Haig deserves great credit for the assiduity with which he has investigated this difficult question, in a scientific\nas well as historical point of view; and we heartily congratulate him on the result of his useful labours, exhibited in the lately published volume on the Indus Delta country.\n\nF.

XII.\u2014Writing, Printing, and the Alphabet in Corea.\nBy W. G. Aston.\n\nWriting.\n\nThe first definite statement with regard to a knowledge of the art of writing in Corea belongs to A.D. 372, the same year in which Buddhism was introduced from Tsin in Western China. The standard history of ancient Corea, known as the Tong-kuk-thong-kam, or, more briefly, the Tongkam, informs us that in this year \"Kokury\u00f6\" established a High School, in which pupils were taught.\" Two years later, the same work contains the following notice:\n\n\"P\u00e8kch\u00e9 appointed one Kohung as Professor. From the establishment of the kingdom of P\u00e8kch\u00e9 until this time it had no letters. It now for the first time had written records.\"\n\nOf course the writing here referred to was the use of the Chinese character. As we shall see presently, it was not until centuries later that any means were invented of committing the Corean language to writing. It is probable,\n\n1 Corea was at this time divided into three kingdoms\u2014Kokury\u00f6, P\u00e8kch\u00e9, and Silla.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1895.\nhowever, that these notices refer only to a regular course of study of Chinese under official auspices and the use of that language in official documents. There is good reason to think that some knowledge of writing already existed at least on the part of individuals, and it is unlikely that the Chinese occupation of Corea during the Han dynasty should not have left some traces of literary culture among the inhabitants.\n\nThe ordinary Japanese chronology gives A.D. 285 as the date of the first introduction of the art of writing from Corea into Japan. This is, of course, irreconcilable with the above statements. But for reasons I have given elsewhere, the Japanese chronology must here be rejected. The true date is A.D. 405, or 31 years after the first use of written records in P\u00e8kch\u00e9.\n\nThe Japanese scholar Hirata mentions 514 as the date of the first introduction of the art of writing into Silla, but on what authority he does so is not clear.\n\nPrinting.\n\nThe subject of printing in Corea has been fully dealt with by Mr. E. Satow in two papers published in the Transactions of the Japan Asiatic Society for 1882,\u00b9 and I merely take this opportunity of supplementing his essays by a few gleanings from the native histories of that country.\n\nI have not been able to discover any record of the first introduction of the art of printing into Corea, but it may be provisionally referred to the end of the tenth or the beginning of the eleventh century. Printed books were known in Japan in 987, and printing introduced early in\n\n\u00b9 It is not a little surprising that the interesting account given by Mr. Satow of early printing in Japan and Corea should have attracted so little attention from writers on the history of printing and from lovers of old and curious books. Many of the works described by him date from a period anterior to the so-called invention of printing in Europe, and bibliophiles whose horizon is not limited by the Suez Canal may still hope to secure copies. The libraries of the monasteries of Corea are said to possess treasures of this kind which no European has seen, and Japan is perhaps not quite exhausted.\n\nA good number of the books referred to by Mr. Satow are now in the British Museum.\nthe twelfth century. It is probable that Corea preceded Japan by a short time in borrowing this invention, like that of writing, from China.\n\nThe first mention of this art in Corea which has come under my observation belongs to A.D. 1056. Under this date the Tongkam contains the following notice:\n\n\"8th month.\u2014The Governor of the Western Capital (Phy\u00f6ng yang) represented to the king that the text-books in use by the senior and junior graduates of the capital, being all handed down by copying, contained numerous errors. He therefore requested that the books deposited in the Hanlin College (of Corea), viz., the nine classics, the histories of the Han, Tsin, and Thang dynasties, the Analects, the Classic of Filial Piety, the Child's History, the literary collections of various authors, works on medicine and divination, geography (including geomancy), law, and arithmetic, should be distributed among the various colleges. The king gave orders to the proper functionaries to print one copy of each and send them.\"\n\nAnother notice in the same work belongs to the year 1192. It is there stated that a Corean scholar having compiled a treatise on economy called \u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451, orders were given that it should be carved on blocks and copies distributed to the learned ministers of the king's court.\n\nAs an evidence of the estimation in which books were held in Corea, it may be mentioned that in 1314 an agent who was sent to China brought back 10,800 volumes, and that in the same year the Emperor of China made a present to the King of Corea of 4371 volumes.\n\n1403 A.D. is an important date in the history of printing in Corea. In that year the first fount of moveable copper types was provided. This was carefully preserved, and subsequently added to in 1420, 1434, 1772, and 1777. But for further details Mr. Satow's papers, already mentioned, must be referred to.\n\nAmong the books printed by the 1434 fount of types are mentioned the Sohak (\u5c0f\u5b78) and the Sam-kang-heng-sil (\u4e09\u7db1\u884c\u5be6), the latter being an illustrated work.\nAlphabet.\n\nBy far the more important part of Corean literature is in the Chinese language, and is, of course, written by means of the Chinese character. But there is also a popular literature, consisting mainly of tales and books of edification, which is in Corean. For this an alphabetical script of native invention is in use, which is known as the \u00d6nmun or vulgar character.\n\nThe origin of this alphabet has been the subject of some controversy. Hirata and other Shinto scholars assigned it to those vague prehistoric times of Japan called the \"Age of the Gods,\" but this notion, never a very plausible one, is now completely exploded,\\(^1\\) and has no adherents at the present day, except, perhaps, the French savant, M. de Rosny.\n\nAnother view is that the \u00d6nmun was invented by a Corean scholar named Sy\u00f6lchhong, who lived towards the end of the seventh century. This error had its origin in a confusion of the \u00d6nmun with the Nido, i.e. \"clerk's way,\" a system of writing Corean which was really invented by Sy\u00f6lchhong. But the Nido, which is still in use, especially by the clerks in public offices, is a means of representing Corean words by the use of a number of the more common Chinese characters to which a phonetic value is given. The Japanese employed a similar method about the same time, as may be seen in the poetry of the Kojiki and Nihongi. The Nido is therefore a syllabic script, and is quite different from the \u00d6nmun, which was framed after the model of the Sanskrit alphabet.\n\nThe date of the invention of the \u00d6nmun is recorded with precision in the Corean standard history of the present dynasty, called Kuk-cho-pong-kam (\u570b\u671d\u5bf6\u9451). Under the year 1446, this work contains the following passage:\n\n\"The twenty-eight \u00d6nmun letters invented by the king are in imitation of the ancient seal character, and are classed as\n\n\\(^1\\) Vide a paper in this Journal for July, 1883, entitled \"Two Questions of Japanese Archaeology,\" by B. H. Chamberlain.\ninitial, medial, and final sounds. Though the characters are simple, they may be used in infinitely various ways. In the preface written by Chy\u00f6ng Liu-chi, President of the Board of Ceremonies, it is said, . . . This Eastern Land of ours resembles China in its ceremonies, its music, and its material civilization, but it differs from that country in its language. Hence scholars complained that their ideas could not be made clear, and the officials charged with criminal matters that the niceties of legal argumentation could not be rendered intelligible. Accordingly, in ancient times, Sy\u00f6lchhong of Silla invented the mitu, which has been in use until the present day, both by officials and private persons. This consisted, however, altogether in the borrowed (i.e. phonetic) use of Chinese characters, with the result, sometimes of impediment and sometimes of obstruction. It is in short a rude and inaccurate method, inadequate to express one ten-thousandth part of our spoken language.\n\n\"In the winter of the year 1443 the king invented characters for the twenty-eight true sounds, and drew up directions for their use, giving them the title of 'True Sound Characters for the instruction of the people.' These letters, like the ancient seal characters, depend on sound, and, therefore, the seven-fold vocal combinations, the three extremes, and the refinement of the two breathings, are all comprised in them. These twenty-eight letters can be variously applied without limit. They are simple and yet essential; they are minutely accurate and yet readily intelligible. A clever man can understand them in less than a morning. A stupid man may learn them in ten days. By these (Chinese) writings can be explained so that their import may be known; by these the facts of judicial causes may be ascertained. In pronouncing Chinese characters the distinction between hard and soft consonants, in music, the harmony of the notes of the chromatic scale, can all be fully and adequately rendered by their use. Even the noise of the wind, the scream of the crane, the crowing of cocks, and the barking of dogs, can all be written down by means of them. . . . .\"\n\nThe alphabet thus introduced to the Corean public was as follows:\n\nInitials and Finals.  \nInitials only.  \n\nFinals.  \nk n t l m p s as initial, spiritus lenis  \nt as final. as initial,  \nng as final.  \n\nch chh th kh ph h.\nVowels. \u314f \u3151 \u3153 \u3155 \u3157 \u315b \u315c \u3160 \u3161 \u3163 \u3150\na ya \u00f6 y\u00f6 o yo u y\u00fc eu i \u00e6.\n\nThe two combinations \u315c-\u3163 w\u00f6 and \u3157-\u3163 wa, with a special use of \u3163, make up the number 28 above mentioned.\n\nThe \"two breathings\" are probably the aspirated and unaspirated letters, which differ in the same way as the corresponding letters in Sanskrit, not like our t and th, etc.\n\nThe statement that the \u00d6nmun was framed after the model of the ancient seal character of China is quite unintelligible. Another Corean authority states that it was made upon the pattern of the Sanskrit alphabet, and internal evidence leaves no doubt that this is the case. A comparison with the Devanagari discloses several points of resemblance which cannot be accidental, and the fact that it is an alphabet and not a syllabary like the Japanese Kana points to the same conclusion. Nor is this all. It will be observed that a classification of letters according to the organs of speech with which they are pronounced was known to the inventor. Those letters which belong to the same class contain the same element, the labials the element , the dentals , the gutturals , the throat breathings O, and the sibilants and palatals . Perhaps, however, he had primarily in view the Chinese classification of sounds known as the Hung-wu (1368\u20131398) sounds, which is itself based on a study of the Sanskrit alphabet. According to the Hung-wu system there are seven classes of sounds, viz.: grinder (guttural), tongue-tip (dental), lip (labial), tooth-tip (palatal), throat (breathing), half-tongue (l), and half-tooth (j, the initial sound of \u6708).\n\nNo doubt the reason why all mention of the Sanskrit alphabet was avoided by the President of the Board of Ceremonies was its association with Buddhism, which has long been a discredited religion in Corea. Its revenues are insignificant, its temples banished from the cities, and its priests counted with vagabonds and outcasts.\n\nIn one respect the \u00d6nmun does imitate the Chinese character. The grouping of the letters into syllables\nfollows the same order as the strokes of which a Chinese character is composed, viz. from left to right and from top to bottom. For example \u3145 \u314f \u3131 sak is written \u3145\u314f\u3131. The syllables, too, follow one another in columns, which are read in Chinese fashion from top to bottom, proceeding from right to left.\n\nIt may be observed that there is no provision in this alphabet for the distinction between hard and soft consonants. In order to mark this difference in writing foreign words such as Chinese, the letters are doubled for the soft consonants, a device which to our minds ought to have a precisely opposite effect. The Coreans attach no importance to this distinction in their own language, although their consonants are frequently pronounced soft in the middle of a word.\n\nThe annexed specimen (vide Plates) of an \u00d6nmun text is reproduced from a Corean book in the British Museum. It will be observed that there are three parts\u2014a Chinese text, an \u00d6nmun translation in the upper margin, and an illustration. The work from which it is taken is the Sam-kang-heng-sil, of which an edition in 1434, printed with moveable types, has been already mentioned. The present edition, however, has every appearance of having been printed from blocks. The original \u00d6nmun edition of this work appeared in 1481, and I am inclined to believe that the copy in the British Museum is of this date, but it would be too much to affirm so positively. In any case the wood-engraving belongs to a very early period in the history of the art, and the text is probably the oldest specimen extant of the \u00d6nmun script.\nART. XIII.\u2014Ghatay\u0101la Inscription of the Pratih\u0101ra Kakkuka,\nof [Vikrama-]S\u0101\u1e41vat 918. By Munshi Debi-pras\u0101d,\nof Jodhpur.\u00b9\n\nThe stone which bears this inscription is in the wall of\na small building which is close to some ruins about a mile\neast of Gha\u1e6day\u0101la, a village situated about twenty miles\nnorth of the city of Jodhpur. It contains twenty-two\nlines of writing, which cover a space of about 2' 2'' broad\nby 1' 9'' high. The first twenty lines are well preserved;\nof the two others the greater part is effaced or broken\naway, together with any subsequent lines of writing which\nthe inscription originally may have contained. The size\nof the letters is about \u00bc''. The characters are N\u0101gar\u012b;\nthey closely resemble those of the Jodhpur inscription of\nB\u0101uka, and have been drawn and engraved with the same\ncare and skill.\u00b2 The language, up to nearly the end of\nline 20, is M\u0101h\u0101r\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dr\u012b Pr\u0101k\u1e5bit; the small remainder\nis in Sanskrit; and the whole is in verse. In respect of\northography it will be sufficient to state that the letter b,\nwhen it is not combined with another consonant, is denoted\nby a sign of its own, not by the sign for r.\n\nThe inscription treats of the same line of Pratih\u0101ra\n(Pad\u012bh\u0101ra or Parih\u0101ra) chiefs which is eulogised in the\nJodhpur inscription of B\u0101uka; and it is of some value\nboth because it corrects and adds to the information which\nhas been drawn from that inscription, and because by far\n\n\u00b9 Like the paper on the Jodhpur inscription of the Pratih\u0101ra B\u0101uka, published\nin this Journal for 1894, p. 1 ff., this paper also has been prepared by Professor\nKielhorn, from rubbings and rough copies of the text and translation of the\ninscription, sent to the Secretary by Munshi Debi-pras\u0101d of Jodhpur.\n\u00b2 For a somewhat rough lithograph of the two first lines of the inscription,\nsee Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha's Palaeography of India, plate xvi.\nthe greater part of it is written in Pr\u0101k\u1e5bit. Its proper object is,- to record (in verses 22 and 23) that a chief named Kakkuka (Kakkua) founded a Jaina temple and made it over to a Jaina community which belonged to the gachchha of Dhane\u015bvara. But it also tells us (in verses 19-21) that the same chief, on a date which will be considered below, established a market at the village of Rohinsakupa, and erected two pillars, one at the same village and the other at M\u0101ddoara. And by way of introduction it gives (in verses 3-6) the following genealogy of Kakkuka:\u2014\n\nThe Br\u0101hma\u1e47 Harichandra and his wife Bhadr\u0101, who was of the Kshatriya caste, had a son named Rajjila. His son was Narabha\u1e6da; his son, N\u0101gabha\u1e6da (N\u0101ha\u1e0da); his son, T\u0101\u1e6da; his son, Ya\u015bovardhana; his son, Chanduka; his son, \u015ailluka; his son, Jho\u1e6da; his son, Bhilluka; his son, Kakka; and his son, from Durlabhadevi, Kakkuka. With the exception of Durlabhadevi and her son Kakkuka, all these persons were known to us already (some under slightly different names) from the Jodhpur inscription; but the present inscription shows that Ya\u015bovardhana was the son of T\u0101\u1e6da, not, as has been wrongly inferred from the Jodhpur inscription, of T\u0101\u1e6da\u2019s younger brother Bhoja, who is here omitted; and that the son of \u015ailluka (\u015ailuka or \u015ailuka) was named Jho\u1e6da, not Jh\u0101\u1e6dovara. According to the Jodhpur inscription Kakka had another son, named B\u0101uka, from the Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u00f1\u012b Padmin\u012b; he, of course, must have been a brother of Kakkuka, who in the present inscription is described as the son of Kakka and Durlabhadevi. If Munshi Debipras\u0101d were right in reading the date of the Jodhpur inscription sa\u1e41vata 940, Kakkuka, whose present inscription contains a date of the year 918, would have to be considered as the predecessor of B\u0101uka; but, judging from the rubbing of the Jodhpur inscription, I still believe the date of that inscription to be sa\u1e41vata 4, and it therefore remains doubtful which of the two chiefs was the elder brother.\nThe date given in verse 19 of the present inscription is Wednesday, the second lunar day of the bright half of Chaitra of the year 918 (apparently of the Vikrama era), while the moon was in the nakshatra Hasta. This last item at once shows that the date cannot be correct; for the moon might well be in Hasta on the second tithi of the dark half of the purnimanta Chaitra, but it would never be there on the second of the bright half of Chaitra. Nor is the week-day right; for Chaitra-sudi 2 would correspond, for the Chaitr\u0101di Vikrama year 918 current, to Tuesday, the 27th February, A.D. 860; for the Chaitr\u0101di Vikrama year 918 expired, to Monday, the 17th March, A.D. 861; and for the K\u0101rttik\u0101di Vikrama year 918 expired, to Friday, the 6th March, A.D. 862. And it may be added that the second tithi of the dark half of the purnimanta Chaitra also did not end on a Wednesday in either the current or the expired Vikrama year 918. But although several of the details of the date are thus shown to be incorrect, there appears to be no reason why the year of the date, too, should be looked upon with suspicion, and I therefore believe that the two chiefs B\u0101uka and Kakkuka, in accordance with the present inscription, may be confidently placed in the second half of the ninth century A.D. From this it would follow that the chief Bh\u0101ttikadevar\u0101ja, who in the Jodhpur inscription is stated to have been defeated by B\u0101uka\u2019s ancestor \u015ailuka, must have lived about the middle of the eighth century A.D., or about a hundred years before the Bh\u0101tti chief Deor\u0101j of Jaisalmer, who is recorded to have been born in Vikrama-sa\u1e41vat 892.\n\nIn addition to the villages Rohinsaktupa and Maddoara, which have not been identified, the inscription mentions several countries or districts for which the reader is referred to the text and translation of verses 16 and 17.\nText.\n\nL. 1. \u091a\u094b\u0902 [\u0967*] \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093e\u092a\u0935\u0928\u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092a\u0926\u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093e\u092f \u092c\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0924\u0947 \u0926\u0947\u0936\u0964\n\u092f\u094b\u0917\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0930\u094d\u0923 \u092a\u0930\u092e\u0917\u0941\u0930\u094d\u091c \u092f\u092e\u0939\u093f \u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0939\u0964\u2014[1.]\n\n2. \u0930\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0923\u094b \u092a\u0935\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0940 \u0906\u0938\u0940 \u0935\u093f\u0930\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0915\u094d\u0937\u094b \u0924\u093f\u0930 \u0930\u093e\u092e\u0938\u0964\n\u0924\u0947\u0937\u094d\u092f \u092a\u0935\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u092e\u094b\u093d \u0938\u092e\u0941\u0916\u0948\u0903 \u090f\u0935\u0902 \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092d\u0935\u094b\u0965\u2014[2.]\n\u0935\u093f\u092a\u094d\u0930\u094b \u0935\u093f\u0930\u093f\u0924\u094d-\n\n3. \u0939\u0930\u093f\u091a\u094d\u091b\u093e\u0926\u0940 \u0905\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e \u0906\u0938\u0940 \u0924\u093f\u0930 \u0916\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0938\u093e \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0964 \u0924\u093e\u0932\u0941 \u0938\u0941\u092d\u094b\n\u091a\u092a\u094d\u092a\u0932\u094b \u0913\u0930\u094b \u0935\u093f\u0930\u093f\u0930\u091c\u094d\u091e\u094b \u090f\u0935\u0902\u0965\u2014[3.] \u091a\u093e\u0938 \u0935\u093f\n\u092f\u0930\u0939\u0921\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092e\u094b \u0906\u0936\u094b \u0935\u093f\u0930\u093f\u0924\u094d-\n\n4. \u092f\u093e\u0939\u094d\u092f\u094b \u0924\u093f\u0930 \u090f\u0935\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0964 \u091a\u093e\u0938 \u0935\u093f \u0924\u0925\u093e\u092f\u094b \u0924\u093e\u0932\u0941 \u0924\u0938\u094d\u0935 \u0935\u093f \u0935\u0938-\n\u0935\u0926\u094d\u092f\u094b \u0906\u0936\u094b\u0965\u2014[4.] \u091a\u093e\u0938 \u0935\u093f \u091a\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0941\u091a\u093e\u092e\u093e\u0903 \u091a\u092a\u094d\u092a\u0932\u094b\n\u0938\u093f\u0915\u0941\u091a\u094b\u093d \u0935\u093f \u090f\u0935\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0964 \u0918\u094b\u093d\u2014\u096b\n\n5. \u091c\u094b \u0924\u093f\u0930 \u0924\u0938\u094d\u0935 \u0924\u0925\u093e\u092f\u094b \u091a\u093e\u0938 \u0935\u093f \u0935\u093f\u0930\u093f\u0928\u093f\u092e\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092f\u094b \u091a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0939\u0965\u2014[5.]\n\u0935\u093f\u0930\u093f\u0928\u093f\u092e\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092f\u0938 \u0924\u0925\u093e\u092f\u094b \u0935\u093f\u0930\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0915\u094b \u0917\u0941\u092a\u094d\u0924\u0941\u092c\u093f\u0939\u093f \u092c\u093e\u0930\u0935\u093f\u091a\u094b\u0964\n\u091a\u093e\u0938 \u0935\u093f \u092f\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u091a\u094d\u091b\u093e-\n\n6. \u092e\u094b \u0907\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0926\u0947\u0935\u0940\u090f \u091a\u092a\u094d\u092a\u0932\u094b\u0965\u2014\u0965 [6.] \u0926\u0947\u0935\u093f\u092f\u093e\u092e\u093e\u0902 \u0939\u0930\u093f\u091a\u094d\u091b\n\u092e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0930\u0902 \u092d\u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u092f\u0902 \u092a\u0935\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u092e\u094b\u093d \u0938\u094b\u092e\u0902\u0964 \u092c\u092e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u0902 \u091a\u093e\u0938 \u092f \u0926\u094b\u0937\u0903 \u0930\u094b-\n\n1 Read \u091a\u094b\u0902\u092c\u093e\u0938\u0940.\n2 This has been altered to \u0938\u092e\u0941\u0916\u0948\u0903, which it should be.\n3 Read, perhaps, \u092f\u092e\u093e\u092e\u094b.\n4 The Jodhpur inscription has \u0917\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0915\u094d\u0937 in line 10, and \u0917\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0915\u094d\u0937 in line 12.\n5 This akshara is quite clear in the rubbings.

XIV.\u2014Mahuan's Account of the Kingdom of Bengala (Bengal). By Geo. Phillips, M.R.A.S.\n\nIntroductory Notice.\n\nThe following is a Chinese description of the kingdom of Bengal, written at the commencement of the fifteenth century, about eighty years before the Portuguese discovered the route round the Cape of Good Hope, and about sixty years or so after Ibn Batuta had visited those regions. This account is a chapter taken from a work, bearing the Chinese title Ying-yai-sh\u00eang-lan (a general account of the shores of the ocean), compiled by one Mahuan, an Interpreter attached to the suite of Ch\u00eang Ho, who was sent to the various kingdoms of the western ocean by the Chinese Emperor Yung-lo. The object of this expedition was, that the Emperor Yung-lo feared that Hui-ti, his predecessor, whom he had driven from the throne, was concealing himself in some country over the sea; he wanted to trace him, and at the same time to display his military force in foreign countries, in order to show that China was rich and strong.\n\nIn the sixth month of the year 1405, he ordered Ch\u00eang Ho, his companion Wang Ching Hung, and others, to go as envoys to the kingdoms in the western ocean. They took with them 30,000 soldiers and a large quantity of gold and silks. The fleet consisted of 62 ships, most of them of large tonnage, some measuring 440 feet long and 180 feet broad. They sailed from Liu-kia-kiang, an inlet of the\n\n---\n\n1 Ibn Batuta travelled in Bengal and visited Sunargoon in 1341.\n2 Such are the dimensions given to the Chinese vessels composing the expedition in the \"Ming Dynasty History Book,\" 304. There can be no doubt the size of the vessels is greatly exaggerated; at the same time, however, the junks of those days were much larger than those of the present century\u2014in some books of that period they are described as high as city walls and houses.\nYang-tze, situated a little to the north of Wusung, the entrance of the Shanghai river. They touched on their way south at Woga, at the mouth of the Min, from which place they sailed to Cochin China, and so on to the various countries in the Straits and India, making known at each place the orders from the Emperor.\n\nThey gave presents to the princes and chiefs, and those who would not submit were compelled to do so by force. Mahuan has left us an account of twenty of the kingdoms visited by the expedition: those relating to Java and Sumatra have been translated into English by Mr. W. P. Groeneveldt, while the chapter relating to Cochin China was translated by the late Mr. Mayers. The chapters relating to Siam and Ceylon have been translated by myself, and have appeared in the Journal of the China branch of this Society. The remaining chapters I have also translated, and the one relating to Bengal I am now about to read.\n\nThese travels, handed down to us by Mahuan, are well worthy of taking a place beside those of other medi\u00e6val travellers, such as Marco Polo, Friar Odoric, and Ibn Batuta. The most curious point about all these travellers is the striking resemblance that their descriptions bear to each other, which has been most happily described by the late learned scholar, Sir Henry Yule, when speaking of Friar Jordan's travels: \"One must notice,\" says he, \"the frequent coincidences of statement, and almost of expression, between this and other travellers of the same age, especially Marco Polo; at first one would think that Jordan had Polo's book, but he certainly had not Ibn Batuta's, and the coincidences with him are sometimes almost as striking. Had these ancient worthies, then, a Murray, from whom they pilfered experiences as modern travellers do. I think they had, but their Murray lay in the traditional yarns of the Arab sailors with whom they voyaged, some of which seem to have been handed down steadily from the time of Ptolemy\u2014per-adventure Herodotus\u2014almost to our own day.\"\n\nTo this I might add that there are passages to be met with in Mahuan's travels which look as if they had been\npilfered direct from Marco Polo and Ibn Batuta and others, but this would have been quite impossible. Many, perhaps, are apt to think that the navigation of the Eastern seas in early times was entirely in the hands of the Arabs, Indians, and Persians; such was not really the case.\n\nIt should be mentioned here that the Indians and Persians most probably went to China by sea at the commencement of our era, and continued to do so for many centuries afterwards. For example, the Buddhist pilgrim Fa-hien, in 413, returned to China from Ceylon in an Indian vessel. I quite agree with my friend W. P. Groeneveldt, a gentleman holding a high post in Her Netherland Majesty's service in Java, and a ripe Chinese scholar, that the Chinese did not arrive in the Malay Archipelago before the fifth century, and that they did not extend their voyages to India, Arabia, and Persia till a century later. There is positive evidence, however, that in the Tang dynasty 618 to 906, their sailors were well acquainted with the navigation of the Indian seas, for sailing directions are to be found dating from that period, clearly setting forth the route and naming the countries to be met with between Canton and Bussorah at the head of the Persian Gulf. In these directions there is a most striking passage regarding the dangers to be guarded against when reaching El-Obollah, where beacons were said to be placed in the sea, upon which fires were lighted at night for the guidance of mariners. These beacons are mentioned in El-Masudi's historical \"Encyclop\u00e6dia,\" translated by Dr. Sprenger. He says: \"Marks of wood are erected for sailors in the sea at El-Obollah, and look like three seats in the middle of the water, on which fires are burnt at night to caution vessels which come from Oman, Siraf, and other places.\" Reference is also made to these marks in the travels of Ibn Batuta, Lee's translation, page 36. This and other passages in the directions show clearly what knowledge the Chinese had of the navigation of these seas.\n\nIt will naturally be asked, from what port in China did these vessels sail? Canton appears, up to the\neleventh century, to have been the chief southern port frequented by foreign ships, and from which native vessels sailed for foreign countries. In 1086, or soon after the time of the Norman conquest of England, the eastern ports of China, viz. Changchow and Chinchew, were made ports of entry and exit for vessels carrying on foreign trade. Prior\\(^1\\) to this all Fookien craft, going to and returning from foreign countries, were compelled to report themselves to the Canton Customs authorities. This was looked upon as a great hardship by the Fookien merchants, and, upon representation being made to the throne, a superintendent of Customs was appointed to collect the Customs revenue at these two Fookien ports. At this time a port sprang up into notice at the entrance of the Changchow river, not far from the present treaty port of Amoy, which, with the neighbouring port of Chinchew, did much of the foreign carrying trade of that part of China. Ships were built by the richer and manned by the poorer classes, and, eager in the pursuit of gain, were sent on long and distant voyages to foreign countries. This port was from 1086 to 1566 known as Gehkong, and is probably the Caichan, or Kaycon, of Friar Odoric, known also as Zaitun.\\(^2\\) The trade of this port and that of Chinchew is now centred in Amoy. In 1561 this district suffered greatly from Japanese raids, and its commerce was almost entirely destroyed.\n\nIt should be known that the Japanese had been a scourge to this part of China for over twenty years, and they had inspired the people with such fear and dread, that for many years after the bare mention of the words Oe-a-loi, \u201cthe Japanese are coming,\u201d frightened the children into obedience, much in the same way as our fathers and mothers were frightened when they were told that \u201cBoney\u201d would have\n\n\\(^1\\) In the seventh year of T'ai p'ing hing kuo's reign, 983 of our era, Changchow as well as Chinchew junks were engaged in the trade with foreign countries.\u2014\u201cThe Annals of the Canton Customs,\u201d a book found in the Summer Palace at Peking. In 1285 there was a superintendent of Customs at Changchow, who collected all shipping dues.\n\n\\(^2\\) In substantiation of this statement I refer the reader to Yule's \u201cCathay, and the way thither,\u201d vol. ii, appendix, p. xxiv.\nthem. To this day in Amoy, I am informed by Dr. J. J. M. de Groot, when the common people are angry with each other they make use of the expression Ok-na-koue-ni, \"You are as cruel as a Japanese.\"\n\nThe next interesting point we have to discuss is, how the Chinese found their way to these distant foreign countries. It was my good fortune, many years ago, while strolling through a temple in the neighbourhood of Amoy, to come across a well-educated Chinaman, who was spending the summer there, who was most anxious to hear from me all about foreign countries, and he astonished me with his knowledge of the medi\u00e6val geography of India and the East generally. I naturally enquired where he got his knowledge from, and he said, \"Come with me to my room and I will show you my books.\" On entering he handed me a copy of a book called the \"Wu-pei-chih,\" which related chiefly to the art and science of war\u2014a science which, by the way, has of late been sadly neglected by the Chinese to their cost. At the end of this work there is a set of maps said to be a copy of those used by Ch\u00eang Ho when he went on his expedition in 1416. Although these charts are stated to date from that time, there are to be found in them every place mentioned by Marco Polo on his voyage from China to Ormus, and I am inclined to think that charts, or charts of this nature, were in existence in Marco Polo's day. My reasons for so thinking are these: Marco Polo mentions that he derived some of his information as to the whereabouts of the countries he described by their being pointed out to him on the sea charts of the coasts of India. Further, Polo speaks of vessels being navigated by means of the North Star, and the latitude of places being determined by the number of cubits such star was above the horizon. In the charts said to be used in Ch\u00eang Ho's expedition, the latitude of places is shown by the North Star being reckoned at so many digits and so many eighths high. These are called in Chinese Chih and Chio: the first corresponds to the Arabic Issaba or Terfa, meaning a finger; and the latter to the Arabic Zam. In one word\nthe Chinese manner of navigation appears to have been the same as set forth in the Mohit, a Turkish work on navigation, a translation of which is to be found in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol. v, page 444, 1836. The system of navigation appears to be also the same as that described by the Moorish pilot engaged by Vasco da Gama at Melinda. I might mention that in the identification of the various names met with in Chinese books of this period, a knowledge of the Amoy dialect enables one more readily to identify what place is meant than by reading the characters according to the Mandarin sound: for example, Marco Polo mentions a kingdom in Sumatra called Dragoian, or Dagoyam; this has puzzled many commentators, but on the Chinese chart I have mentioned there is a country called Ta-hua-mien, which in the Amoy dialect is pronounced Dakolien, in which it is very easy to recognize the Dragoian, or Dagoyam, of Marco Polo.\n\nI think it is now time we turned our attention to reading Mahuan's description of Bengal; this account was apparently written not more than sixty years after Ibn Batuta had visited that country, and most of the names given by the Arab traveller are easily recognizable in those used by our Chinese traveller.\n\nI cannot conclude these introductory remarks to my paper without paying a tribute to the late learned geographer, Sir Henry Yule, in the wonderful exactness with which he has elucidated the travels of Ibn Batuta in Bengal in a sketch map given in his work \"Cathay, and the way thither.\" Nothing clearer could be given to show the Chinese traveller's route to the kingdom of Bengala: thereon is seen marked Chittagong, where the Chinese envoy landed, and the river up which he travelled until he reached Sona-urh-kong, called Sonarcawan by the Arab traveller; the position of Bengala as lying to the westward of Chittagong, and not to the eastward as placed by some early geographers, is here clearly defined, and fully agrees with the position given to it by our Chinese traveller.\nMahuan's Account of the Kingdom of Bengala (Bengal).\n\nTranslated from the \"Ying-yai-sh\u00eang-lan.\"\n\nThe kingdom of Pang-ko-la, \u699c\u845b\u523a, Bengala, is reached by ship from the kingdom of Su-men-ta-la, \u9806\u9580\u7b54\u524c, as follows: A course is shaped for the Mao-shan, \u5e3d\u5c71, and Tsui-lan Islands, \u7fe0\u85cd\u5c71; these being reached, the vessel then has to steer north-west, and being favoured with a fair wind for twenty-one days, arrives first at Cheh-ti-gan, \u6e05\u5730\u6e2f, where she anchors. Small boats are then used to ascend the river, up which, at a distance of 500 li or more, one arrives at a place called Sona-urh-kong (Sunargaon), \u9396\u7d0d\u5152\u6e2f, where one lands; travelling\n\n1 Sumentala. The Samara of Marco Polo. The kingdom of Samalenga in Sumatra, near Acheen.\n\n2 Mao-shan. An island off Acheen Head, most probably Pulo Bras or Nasi.\n\n3 Tsui-lan Islands. The Nicobars. I am unable to give any explanation why these islands were so named by the Chinese; there can, however, be no doubt as to these islands being the Nicobars, for we are told by Mahuan, in his article on \"Ceylon,\" that the largest of these islands was called Sa-beh-luan, which is a pretty accurate Chinese rendering of Sambelong, the name given to the largest of the Nicobars, according to Milburne, \"Oriental Commerce,\" vol. ii, p. 94. Another Chinese name for the Nicobars is Lo-hing-kuo, \"The Kingdom of Naked People,\" which appellation, according to all voyagers, is fully deserved, for the Nicobarins do not go to much expense in their dress.\n\n[Since writing the above I have thought over the name Tsui-lan, given by the Chinese to the Nicobars, and I have but little doubt that the name in question is a corruption of Nocueran, the name given by Marco Polo to the group. The characters Tsui-lan, \u7fe0\u85cd, are pronounced Ch'ui-lan in Amoy, out of which it is easy to make Cueran. The Chinese omitted the initial syllable and called them the Cueran Islands, while Marco Polo called them the Nocueran Islands.]\n\n4 Cheh-ti-gan. Chittagan. This appears to have been the port of Bengal at which Chinese trading vessels anchored. Probably the Sudcawan of Ibn Batuta and the Chittagong of our day.\n\n5 Li. A li is about the third of a mile; 500 li is approximately 166 miles.\n\n6 So-na-urh-kiang or kong. Probably the Sonarcawan of Ibn Batuta (Suvarna-gramma or Golden Town) has already been mentioned as one of the medieval capitals of Bengal. It appears in Frao Mauro's map as Sonargavam. It lay a few miles south-east of Dacca, but I believe its exact site is not recoverable in that region of vast shifting rivers.\u2014\"Cathay, and the way thither,\" vol. ii, p. 465.\nfrom which place in a south-westerly direction for thirty-five stages\\(^1\\) the kingdom of Bengala is reached. It is a kingdom with walled cities, and [in the capital] the king and officials of all ranks have their residences. It is an extensive country; its products are abundant, and its people numerous; they are Muhammadans, and in their dealings are open and straightforward. The rich build ships, in which they carry on commerce with foreign nations; many are engaged in trade, and a goodly number occupy themselves with agricultural pursuits; while others exercise their crafts as mechanics. They are a dark-skinned race, although you occasionally see among them a light-complexioned person; the men shave their heads, and wear white cloth turbans and a long loose robe with a round collar, which they put on over their heads, and which is fastened in at the waist by a broad coloured handkerchief; they wear pointed leather shoes. The king and his officers all dress like Muhammadans; their head-dress and clothes are becomingly arranged. The language of the people is Bengali; Persian is also spoken there.\n\nThe currency of the country is a silver coin called Tang-ka,\\(^2\\) which is two Chinese mace in weight, is one inch and two-tenths in diameter, and is engraved on either side; all large business transactions are carried on with this coin, but for small purchases they use a sea-shell called by foreigners kao-li.\\(^3\\)\n\nThe ceremonies observed by them on their coming of age, their funerals, sacrifices, and marriages are like those of the Muhammadans.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) A stage, according to Williams, is a league or ten li in length. Thirty-five stages are, therefore, about thirty-five leagues or 105 miles. The Ming-shih, \"The History of the Ming Dynasty,\" gives thirty-five li or about twelve miles from Sona-urh-kong.\n\n\\(^2\\) Tang-ka. Barbosa, as quoted by Yule in his \"Glossary of Anglo-Indian Words,\" p. 682, says it is a round coin like ours, with Moorish letters on both sides, and it is of very fine silver.\n\nTankas were of the silver currency of the day, in which was amalgamated a great deal of alloy, so that each Tank only exchanged for sixteen copper piece, making (says Briggs) the Tank only worth about fourpence instead of two shillings (Briggs, \"Firishta,\" 410).\u2014\"Cathay,\" vol. ii, p. 440.\n\n\\(^3\\) Kao-li (cowry). The small white shell Cypraea moneta. These shells were brought from the Maldives; the islanders there bartered them to the people of Bengal for rice.\nThe whole year through is hot like our summer. They have two crops of rice a year. There is also a peculiar kind of rice, whose grain is long, wiry, and red. Wheat, sesamum, all kinds of pulse, millet, ginger, mustard, onions, hemp, quash, brinjals, and vegetables of many descriptions grow there in abundance. Their fruits are also many, among which they number the plantain; they have three or four kinds of wines, the cocoanut, rice, tarry, and kadjang. Ardent spirits are sold in the market-places.\n\nNot having any tea, they offer their guests the betel-nut in its place. Their streets are well provided with shops of various kinds, also drinking and eating-houses and bathing establishments.\n\nThe animals and birds are numerous, among which are camels, horses, mules, asses, buffaloes, bullocks, goats, sheep, geese, ducks, fowls, pigs, dogs, and cats. They have also many other fruits besides the plantain, viz., the jack fruit, mangoes, pomegranates, also sugar-cane, granulated sugar, white sugar, and various candied and preserved fruits.\n\nAmong their manufactures are five or six kinds of fine cotton fabrics [muslins]; one like our Pi-pu has the foreign name of Pi-chih.\u00b9 This fabric is of a soft texture, three feet broad, and made up in lengths of fifty-six or fifty-seven feet.\n\nThere is also a ginger-yellow fabric called Man-ch\u00ea-ti, \u6ef4\u8005\u63d0, four feet or more wide and fifty feet long; it is very closely woven and strong.\n\n\u00b9 \u7562\u6cbb, Pi-chi or Bit-ti, Betteela (?). For the following three names of these Indian fabrics I am unable to find an equivalent.\n\nSha-na-keih, \u6c99\u7c73\u5167\u7384\n\nHin-poi-tung-tali, \u5fc3\u767d\u52d5\u642d\u9ece\n\n\u6c99\u694a\u5152, Sha-ta-urh. Most probably Choutar. A fine cloth so called from its four threads.\n\n\u83ab\u9ed1\u83ab\u52d2, Mo-hei-mo-leh. Most probably the muslin of which the finest muslin sahees are made, and called mamali shahi, which by confusion is generally named marmara shahi (royal marble).\u2014Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, vol. v, p. 468, 1836.\nThere is another fabric, five feet wide and twenty feet long, called Sha-na-kih, \u6c99\u7d0d\u4e5e, like our Lo-pu.\n\nThere is also another kind with the foreign name of Hin-pei-tung-ta-li, \u5ffb\u767d\u52d5\u642d\u9ece, three feet wide and sixty feet long; the meshes of this texture are open and regular; it is somewhat like gauze, and is much used for turbans.\n\nThere is the Sha-ta-urh, made up in lengths of forty or more feet and two feet five or six inches wide; it resembles very much the Chinese San-so.\n\nThere is the Mo-hei-mo-leh, made up in lengths of twenty feet or more and four feet wide; on both sides it has a facing four to five-tenths in thickness, and resembles the Chinese Tow-lo-kien.\n\nThe mulberry tree and silkworms are found there. Silk handkerchiefs and caps, embroidered with gold, painted ware, basins, cups, steel, guns, knives, and scissors are all to be had there. They manufacture a white paper from the bark of a tree, which is smooth and glossy like a deer's skin.\n\nTheir punishments for breaking the law are beating and the bastinado, and transportation to near and far countries. You find there, as with us, officers of various grades, with their public residences, their seals and system of official correspondence; also doctors, astrologers, professors of geomancy, artisans, and artificers. They have a standing Army, which is paid in kind, the commander-in-chief of which is called a Pa-sz\u00fb-la-urh,1 \u5427\u65af\u523a\u5152.\n\nTheir mountebanks wear a long white cotton garment, embroidered with black thread, fastened round their waist with a coloured silk handkerchief; hanging over their shoulders they have a string of coloured stones and coral beads, and on their wrists bracelets of dark red stones. At feasts and parties these people are engaged to play certain pieces of music, and to sing their native songs, and to go through various dances together.\n\n1 Pa-sz\u00fb-la-urh. Most probably Sipahselar, \"a General-in-Chief.\" Persian Sipahs\u00e2l\u00e4r. Yule and Burnell's Glossary, p. 637.\nThere is another class of men called K\u00e0n-siao-su-lu-nai, \u6052\u5bb5\u907c\u9b6f\u5948, that is to say, musicians. These men every morning, at about four o'clock, go to the houses of the high officials and the rich; one man plays a kind of trumpet, another beats a small drum, another a large one: when they commence, their time is slow, and it gradually increases to the end, when the music suddenly stops. In this way they pass on from house to house; at meal-times they again go to all the houses, when they receive presents of food or money.\n\nThere are many conjurors, but their performances are nothing very extraordinary.\n\nThe following feat, however, is worthy of mention. A man and his wife parade the streets with a tiger, secured by an iron chain; on arriving opposite a house they give the following performance: The tiger is unloosed and sits on the ground; the man, quite naked and with a switch in his hand, dances in front of the tiger, pulls him about, knocks him with his fist and kicks him; the tiger becomes enraged, growls and springs upon the man, and they both roll over together. The man then thrusts his arm into the tiger's mouth and down its throat; the tiger dares not bite him; when this is over the chain is again put round the tiger's neck, and he lies down. The performers then beg food for the tiger from the houses round, and they generally get pieces of meat given them for the beast, with a present of money for themselves.\n\nThey have a fixed calendar; twelve months go to the year; they have no intercalary month. The king fits out ships and sends them to foreign countries to trade. Pearls and precious stones are sent as tribute to China.\n\nSuch is Mahuan's account of Bengala; most of his facts are to be found endorsed in the records of foreign countries, to be met with in the Ming dynasty histories. In one account I find that Gai-ya-szu-ting, \u958b\u7259\u601d\u4e01, the king of Bengala, sent, in 1409, an embassy with presents to the\nChinese court; another king of Bengala, by name Kien-fuh-ting, sent a letter to the Emperor of China, written on gold leaf, and accompanied by a present of a giraffe.\n\nThe first embassy, viz. that of Gai-ya-szu-ting, is said to have come to China in the sixth year of Yung-lo\u2019s reign, which corresponds with 1409 of our era. The Bengal king reigning at that time appears to have been Shihab-ad-din Bayazid Shah, who only came to the throne in that year. A former king, Ghiyas-ad-din, who reigned from 1370\u20131396, comes very near the Chinese name Gai-ya-szu-ting, but he had ceased to reign ten years before the embassy is said to have arrived in China. Possibly the Chinese dates are wrong. In the twelfth year of Yung-lo, 1415, the time assigned by the Chinese chroniclers to the arrival of the second embassy in China, Jalal-ad-din was king of Bengal. To make his name agree with the Chinese Kien-fuh-ting is somewhat difficult, but I think no other can be meant. The two characters, Fuh-ting, can be read Hut-ding in the Amoy dialect, and might easily be made to do duty for Ad-din. The character Kien may also be read Gien, but that in no way resembles Jalal. Probably the character Kien may be an error in transcription for some other nearer approaching the sound of Jal. This is all conjecture.\n\nThe names of the kings reigning in Bengal are taken from a work by Stanley Lane-Poole, called \u201cThe Coins of the Muhammadan States of India,\u201d p. 5.\n\nWith regard to the site of the supposed city of Bengala, I am not sufficiently acquainted with the question to enter into a discussion upon the subject.\n\nSir Henry Yule, in his \u201cCathay, and the way thither,\u201d gives a small map to elucidate Ibn Batuta\u2019s travels in Bengal, which seems to be also the route taken by the Chinese travellers from Chittagong to Sona-urh-kong, the site of which latter city Yule seems to think must be looked for some miles southward of the present city of Dacca, and the probability is great that the city of Bengala (if\nsuch a city ever existed) was situated still farther to the southward of the said city of Dacca than Sona-urh-kong.\n\nMahuan's book contains also an account of Calicut, Ormus, Aden, the Maldives, and many other places in the Indian Ocean, which are extremely interesting, as much new light is thrown upon the historical geography of those countries; and I will in another paper give further extracts from this book.\nthis had occasioned dearness. Y\u016bsuf's words were: \"I am astonished at this Government, which is able, in a thousand ways, to bring water into Kazw\u012bn, but is so steeped in neglect that it does not give the slightest consideration to this work, heedless alike of the condition of the people and the embellishment of its capital.\"\n\nAt this juncture a cloud of dust arose from the west of the Maid\u0101n, and Y\u016bsuf Sarr\u0101j, needle in hand, raised his head and perceived that some ceremonial was taking place, but it never occurred to his mind that this procession and parade were on his account. First came twelve pursuivants in their liveries, wearing four-cornered hats; after them twelve standard-bearers carrying the royal banners; then came a band of valets with bundles on their heads, and a body of footmen carrying rods. Behind them came the \"Master of the Horse,\"\u00b9 with led horses having jewelled saddle-cloths thrown over their backs, headstalls bespangled with gems, breast-plates studded with pearls, and emerald ornaments hung round their necks. Next came the M\u00fcll\u0101 B\u0101sh\u012b, Sird\u0101r Zem\u0101n Kh\u0101n, the Waz\u012br, the Mustowf\u012b, our master Jem\u0101l-ed-d\u012bn, the Munejjim B\u0101sh\u012b with the honourable 'Ulem\u0101, the great lords and dignitaries, the nobles, the high officials, followed by a body of infantry. A detachment of cavalry in full array brought up the rear at leisurely pace.\n\nAs soon as they arrived opposite Y\u016bsuf Sarr\u0101j's shop all came to a halt, and the M\u00fcll\u0101 B\u0101sh\u012b and the Sird\u0101r came forward and bowed to Y\u016bsuf, who stood up and made obeisance in great astonishment. The M\u00fcll\u0101 B\u0101sh\u012b then addressed him, saying: \"Master Y\u016bsuf, by the gracious decree of fate, you are to-day King of Ir\u0101n. Shah 'Abb\u0101s has now vacated the royal throne. Vouchsafe to confer on us honour and good fortune by coming to the Royal Hall of Audience, that your auspicious enthronement may there be accomplished.\"\n\nBut Y\u016bsuf Sarr\u0101j, ignorant as he was of the circumstances, was utterly astounded, and although he saw all the\n\n\u00b9 M\u012br Akhwar\u2014Superintendent of the royal stables.\n\"Pillars of the State\" before his eyes for certain, and knew the Mulla Bash\u012b who had spoken these words to be reckoned one of the solid men of Persia, still the affair was so extraordinary and inexplicable that he was nowise able to realize it. Obliged to return an answer, he at length spoke as follows: \"My lord Mulla Bash\u012b! I esteem you one of the solid men of Ir\u0101n, and I know not whether (God forbid!) you have become insane or partaken of 'bang'1 that you address words of this sort to me. I am a poor saddler body. What have I to do with throne or crown? I know not, by Allah! to what to attribute your proceedings. I am amazed and dumbfounded, and humbly beg you will leave your servant in peace.\"\n\nSirdar Zem\u0101n Kh\u0101n then replied: \"To-day you have become the cynosure of the world; we, too, are your slaves and as the dogs of your threshold, and submissive and suppliant expressions to the like of us are no longer befitting. For you lordly command is more suitable, and the issue of orders. We are neither mad nor intoxicated, but all of us in our sound and perfect senses; but the decrees of the Lord are not to be changed. This day all the empire of Ir\u0101n and the sovereignty thereof are entrusted to you. In accordance with the words of the Munejjim Bash\u012b, vouchsafe to come to the royal palace that your auspicious enthronement may take place.\" Then, turning to the valets: \"Bring the regal robes, and attire the cynosure of the universe in them.\"\n\nThe valets come forward bearing a bundle containing a regal dress, enter the shop, and place the bundle on the ground. They then proceed to divest Y\u016bsuf Sarr\u0101j of his old garments and attire him in royal robes. As opposition was unavailing, Y\u016bsuf Sarr\u0101j resigned himself whilst these sapient people carried out their wishes. When they had finished dressing him the Mir Akhwar led up a horse with jewelled trappings, on which they mounted Y\u016bsuf Sarr\u0101j,\n\n---\n\n1 Bang\u2014An intoxicating decoction from powdered hemp leaves. Also called hashish, whence \"hashishin,\" an epithet applied to the followers of the old man of the mountain, which some consider the origin of our word assassin.\nand they all set out for the royal palace with the same ceremony and in the same order as before. As they marched along, the sound of the joyful acclamations raised in the streets by the attendants made the welkin ring. The whole population of Kazw\u012bn, male and female, great and small, came to the windows and thronged the roof-tops to gaze, all from ignorance of the state of the case, being in wonderment. At the gate of the royal palace the f\u012br\u0101shes dismounted Y\u016bsuf Sarr\u0101j, and the M\u016bll\u0101 B\u0101sh\u012b and Sird\u0101r Zem\u0101n Kh\u0101n, taking hold of his arms, conducted him with the utmost respect into an apartment of the palace, and seated him on the royal throne. The \u201cPillars of the State,\u201d the \u2018ulem\u0101, the lords, nobles, and high officials, forming in ranks in front of the throne-room, stood with their hands on their breasts. The M\u016bll\u0101 B\u0101sh\u012b, having recited a prayer, placed the regal crown on the head of Y\u016bsuf Sarr\u0101j, then girt his waist with jewelled belt and scimitar, bound on his arms armlets of precious stones, and placed in his hands a mace studded with diamonds. Then, having recited another prayer, he turned his face to the people and said, \u201cgive voice to your felicitations\u201d; whereupon a shout of congratulation went up to the heavens. The palace walls re-echoed the sound of the acclamations, and trumpets and kettle-drums sounded joyously. At the same moment a royal salute, fired from the palace, made the heavens ring, and at this signal a salute of one hundred and ten rounds was fired from the guns of the fort outside the city. Although, since the times of Sa\u02bfadi and H\u0101fiz, the poetic art had greatly declined in Persia, and the verses of the poets were mostly meaningless, mere verbosity and trash, still, in that same year, some accomplished poets, gifted with the art of improvization, were found to celebrate in fine sonnets the auspicious accession of Y\u016bsuf Sarr\u0101j, comparing him with Solomon for wisdom, with H\u0101tim [T\u0101\u012b] for generosity, with R\u016bstam for courage. After glorifying his power and\n\n1 P\u016bch.\nlikening it to Destiny and Fate, they passed out of sight. The wits of Kazwin found the date of his accession in the following words: \"Y\u016bsuf was not Shah of fair ladies [or of the good], but became Shah of the kingdom of Ir\u0101n.\"\n\nWhen these proceedings had terminated the M\u016bll\u0101 B\u0101sh\u012b intimated to the people that they could depart, and all went out of the royal lev\u00e9e hall, leaving only Y\u016bsuf Shah seated on the throne, \u0100gh\u0101 Mub\u0101rik with a few other eunuchs, \u2018Az\u012bm Beg, chief valet, with some valets before him, and some ferra\u0161es outside the room. Y\u016bsuf Shah was lost in amazement, and after a short reverie turned his face to \u0100gh\u0101 Mub\u0101rik and inquired who he was. \u0100gh\u0101 Mub\u0101rik replied: \"We are the faithful eunuch servants. I am the chief of them, and these are my subordinates who obey my commands.\" Then turning to the valets, he asked: \"Who are ye?\" \u2018Az\u012bm Beg, the head valet, replied: \"Your humble servants, the 'Pish-khidmets.' I am the chief of them, and these are my subordinates.\" Y\u016bsuf Shah next inquired: \"Then who are those standing outside?\" \u2018Az\u012bm Beg replied: \"Those are the ferra\u0161es, who are always ready at your beck and call.\" Y\u016bsuf Shah said: \"Go outside, all of you; \u0100gh\u0101 Mub\u0101rik, let all your subordinates go out, and remain yourself.\" All disappeared. Y\u016bsuf Shah, summoning \u0100gh\u0101 Mub\u0101rik to approach, said to him: \"I perceive from your countenance that you must be a good man. I adjure you by God to tell me what is the origin of this adventure. As you have always been an inmate of Shah \u2018Abb\u0101s\u2019 ander\u016bn it is impossible that you can be ignorant of this matter.\" Now \u0100gh\u0101 Mub\u0101rik, obliged to be constantly at the door of Shah \u2018Abb\u0101s\u2019 apartment ready to carry out his behests, was fully acquainted with the events of the preceding day, and knew all about the consultations which had taken place. He was, in truth, a very ingenuous, truthful man, and considering that it would be wrong to conceal the truth\n\n1 Pish-khidmet\u2014Body-servant, valet de chambre, and table-servant.\n2 Ander\u016bn\u2014Inner apartments, penetralia and seraglio.\nfrom the sovereign, he related the whole of the circumstances, from beginning to end, to Y\u016bsuf Shah. The latter further inquired: \"Then where is Shah 'Abb\u0101s?\" The reply was: \"He has disappeared, disguised in the attire of a mendicant, and his whereabouts is unknown.\"\n\nY\u016bsuf Shah was a man of sense, who had never felt any fears or doubts on account of the stars, but this mysterious elevation filled his heart with terror and apprehension. But notwithstanding all such feelings, he saw no possibility of escape by declining the sovereignty, so, perforce, he applied himself to the discharge of the affairs of the State, and to the exercise of the royal functions. To begin with, he sent for Asad Beg the Ferr\u0101sh B\u0101sh\u012b, and gave him the following orders: \"You will at once take with you twelve ferr\u0101shes and go and arrest Akhwand Samad the M\u016blla B\u0101sh\u012b, Sird\u0101r Zem\u0101n Kh\u0101n, M\u012brz\u0101 Hasan the Waz\u012br, M\u012brz\u0101 Yahy\u0101 the Mustowfi, M\u012brz\u0101 Sadr-ed-d\u012bn the Muncjijim B\u0101sh\u012b, and our Master Jem\u0101l-ed-d\u012bn; you will take them and lodge them in the prison of the citadel, and return and report to me the execution of these orders.\"\n\nAsad Beg bows and sets out.\n\nHe next summoned 'Az\u012bm Beg, the head valet, and says: \"See that they prepare the evening meal for me, for I have eaten nothing to-day.\" The Chief Valet represents: \"I have already given directions, and the cooks are engaged in preparing the repast.\" The Shah said: \"Then do you and the Chief Eunuch come and show me the various rooms and ladies' apartments, one by one, and point out which is my own retiring room.\"\n\nThe Head Valet and Chief Eunuch preceded the Shah, and showed each chamber of the \"ander\u016bn.\" The floor of the first room was covered with carpets of various patterns, and the walls and ceiling embellished with paintings of flowers and plants and rare birds. The second room also was carpeted in like manner, and on its walls were painted portraits of former kings and princes of the Safawi dynasty. On the walls of the third room were depicted the likenesses of the Persian line of monarchs. On the walls of the\nfourth room they had painted pictures of the ancient warriors of Ir\u0101n, and the Diva of Mazander\u0101n of whom Firdausi wrote; these were depicted with horns and tails, and engaged in combat. The walls of the fifth room bore illustrations of the wars between Shah Ism\u0101\u2018il and his rivals. On the walls of the seraglio apartments they had painted pictures of youths politely offering flowers to maidens, and maidens handing goblets to youths. Every chamber was provided with sleeping gear.\n\nY\u016bsuf Shah, having chosen one of the rooms of the seraglio for his owu chamber of repose, asked the Chief Eunuch: \u201cWhich is the ladies\u2019 ornament-room?\u201d The Chief Eunuch replied: \u201cThat is an upper room, but the door is locked, and the key is with \u0100gh\u0101 Hasan, the box-keeper.\u201d At the Shah\u2019s command a valet at once summoned the Box-keeper, and they opened the finery strong-room and showed it to the Shah. It was a large room with boxes ranged on every side. Opening the lids of these, they showed the Shah some wonderful and rare jewellery and rich ornaments; amongst them were Kashmir shawls of great value, beautiful ladies\u2019 dresses, rich silken robes, ear-rings and finger-rings of diamonds, and necklaces of pearls.\n\nY\u016bsuf Shah had three daughters, the eldest fourteen, the middle one twelve, and the youngest eight years old; he had also two sons, six and four years of age. He selected for each of his daughters a brooch, two ear-rings, a ring, a necklace, a dress, and a shawl head-dress; for his wife he chose a shawl head-dress and a dress. Giving these to the Head Eunuch he said to him: \u201cTake these to my old house, in the second street of Kazwin, and deliver them to my wife, and tell her not to be at all uneasy about me, and to send my sons to me here to-morrow.\u201d \u0100gh\u0101 Mub\u0101rik gave the articles to two ferr\u0101shes, who went off with them. The sun set. The Shah having, at the instance of the Chief Valet, returned to the first room, found golden candlesticks lighted up, and a princely repast spread out. Having first performed ablution, and said the evening and bed-time prayers, he sat down to table, and the servants presented\nvarious kinds of dishes. The Shah ate his fill, and they cleared the table. Then they brought ewer and basin, and the Shah washed his hands. They brought coffee, which he drank, and a \"Kaliy\u0101n,\"\u00b9 which he smoked. Thereupon the Ferr\u0101sh B\u0101sh\u012b entered and reported having carried out his orders. The Shah said: \"Very well, you can go.\" After that \u0100gh\u0101 Mub\u0101rik returned to report the delivery of the things, and said: \"The wife and daughters of the Shah were highly delighted with the presents sent them. They had no anxiety about you; on the contrary, they were so very pleased and joyful at this unlooked-for event that they jumped and danced in their exceeding delight.\" So the Shah's mind was at ease regarding his wife and children. He continued to question the Chief Eunuch and Head Valet regarding the particulars of the surroundings, until it was the hour of four,\u00b2 when he arose and proceeded to the sleeping apartment, and they laid out his sleeping attire. He ordered the Head Valet to enjoin the officers of the guard to post sentinels everywhere, according to the previous practice. Then he donned his night attire and went to sleep, and the Chief Eunuch and Valet went to their own apartments.\n\nThe following morning Y\u016bsuf Shah repaired to the lev\u00e9e room and sent for M\u00fcll\u0101 Ramaz\u0101n, K\u016brb\u0101n Beg, M\u012brz\u0101 Jal\u012bl, and M\u012brz\u0101 Zek\u012b, persons he counted amongst his friends, and in whom he had perfect confidence in every respect. He conferred the post of M\u00fcll\u0101 B\u0101sh\u012b on M\u00fcll\u0101 Ramaz\u0101n and the Sird\u0101rship on K\u016brb\u0101n Beg, with the title of Kh\u0101n; the office of Waz\u012br he entrusted to M\u012brz\u0101 Jal\u012bl, and appointed M\u012brz\u0101 Zek\u012b to the rank of \"Mustowf\u012b,\" and abolished the post of Chief Astrologer altogether, as he considered that function detrimental rather than advantageous to the State and Religion.\n\nThe Shah directed that despatches should be sent to the Governors of all provinces, containing stringent orders to the effect that in future no Muslim was on any account to\n\n\u00b9 Kaliy\u0101n\u2014The Persian water-pipe.\n\u00b2 i.e., four hours after sunset.\nbe subjected to punishment without being first tried in the religious courts, and that no person was to be mulcted from mere personal caprice. Sentences of death, the mutilation of ears and noses, and putting out eyes were to be discontinued. Furthermore, trustworthy emissaries\\(^1\\) were selected to go and ascertain the condition of the various provinces and the needs of the people, and report thereon. Y\u016bsuf Sh\u0101h summoned these emissaries to his presence and addressed them as follows: \"Tell the Governors of the provinces from me to fear God, and pass no unjust sentences, to refrain from harassing the people or plundering their property, to accept no bribes, and to rest assured that actions of that sort will, in the long run, lead to misfortune and end in their ruin. They have over and over seen that those who have accumulated wealth by such conduct have eventually perished, or else have encountered utter misfortune, disgrace, and destitution. When possessions have been amassed by such methods in Ir\u0101n, they have never remained permanently in any family. Where are now the crores upon crores of wealth of Ja\u02bfafar Kh\u0101n Damgh\u0101ni? Whither have the flocks, the retinues of Selim Kh\u0101n Kar\u0101kulu betaken themselves? What has become of the possessions of M\u012brz\u0101 Taki Sh\u012br\u0101z\u012b? Whenever the monarchs of Ir\u0101n have perceived that any person of high degree has amassed great wealth, it has been confiscated by the Government. They know it is the property of subjects and dependants, wrested from them by plunder or in bribes, so they forthwith call that person to account on some pretext, and, stripping him of all he possesses, either put him to death or cast him into misery and destitution. This phase of the Governors of our provinces closely resembles that of leeches which have become swollen from sucking blood; their owner gives them a squeeze, when they vomit all that blood; some die in this way, and some live on in a weak and languid state. If, on the other hand, the Governors be virtuous and content with their lawful\n\n\\(^1\\) J\u0101sus\u2014Spies.\nfortunes, they will ever retain their rank, be exalted and reverenced in the sight of the people, and honoured by the king, so that they will increase in dignity day by day.\"\n\nAfter making these instructions clear to them, he dismissed the emissaries. He then repeated his commands that the taxation and levy of duties should be reduced to a moderate amount, that the roads should everywhere be repaired, and the requisite bridges and caravanserais built for each stage, that hospitals should be established in every province, and schools opened, that water should be brought to places devoid of it, that it should be considered an incumbent duty to aid and succour widows and orphans, the blind and the paralytic; also, that in the various provinces it should not be permitted to every good-for-nothing, self-opinionated person to enter himself on the roll of the 'ulem\u0101, but in each particular case the sanction of the M\u00fcll\u0101 B\u0101shi must be obtained, and in no place was the class of the 'ulem\u0101 to be allowed to be in excess of what would suffice for the requirements of the population. He also granted fixed allowances from the public treasury for all the 'ulem\u0101 sufficient for their support, to the end that, being in receipt of Government grants, they should become well-affected to the State and cease to denounce the Government officials and royal servants as oppressors. He took the management of the affairs of the courts of justice, which constitute the mainstay of the State, out of the hands of the 'ulem\u0101, and entrusted it to officials of integrity, so that the people should, as regards their law-suits, consider themselves independent of the 'ulem\u0101, who were only to be so far referred to as not to be altogether excluded from the administration. Lists of the charities necessary in each district were to be submitted to four upright persons, and the poor of the province relieved in accordance with these lists, the accounts being submitted to the royal court, so that none should be excluded from charitable relief. He also ordered that the \"fifths\" and dues of the Im\u0101m should no longer be paid, in order that the descendants of the Prophet (blessings on him and\npeace!) should be saved from the disgrace of begging, and earn their livelihood, like other people, by plying their trades. In this matter, some eminent men of learning showed Y\u016bsuf Shah decisions which they extracted from books of the law. Notifications were also sent to the provinces to the effect that in future no one should presume to offer presents or spread reception carpets for the Shah, the ministers of State, or the attendants of the royal court. No one was to seek office by means of presents, but to consider good services, loyalty, and devotion as the passport to the realization of such ambitions. The Government revenues of every province were to be handed over to trustworthy persons, there to remain to the credit of the treasury, and the Government expenditure, being apportioned in accordance with the account books, should, at the proper time, be appropriated to that district, and the people entirely relieved from any further demands on account of expenditure. Further, he ordained, in view to increase of the State revenue, that the merchants, gentry, nobles, and princes, as also the literati and Seyyids, and all classes of the population, should contribute one-tenth of their incomes in the town, and one-twentieth in the agricultural districts. The pay of the soldiery and other Government servants was not to be withheld, such a course being injurious to the State, but was invariably to be paid without any delay from the provincial treasuries. The sum of five sh\u0101his\\(^1\\) was to be paid to the treasury from the price of all property bought and sold. The existing laws and conditions of pecuniary transactions were to be abrogated, in order that monied people should not be tempted by the laws customary and in force to receive pledges and grant loans on them, in view to necessitous persons becoming desperate and destitute, and then selling up the property placed in pawn at low prices, in hopes of the persons requiring advances being unable to redeem their property.\n\n\\(^1\\) Sh\u0101hi\u2014One-twentieth of a ker\u0101n.\nAs Y\u016bsuf Shah knew\u2014\n\n(1) That the Master of the Horse was in the habit of going to the uplands\\(^1\\) in the summer on pretence of pasturing the royal stud, and committed great oppression on the people of those districts, harrying them and seizing their property and flocks;\n\n(2) That the Commandant of the Artillery drew the whole of the pay of the artillerymen, and did not pay a din\u0101r\\(^2\\) to any of them;\n\n(3) That the Treasurer mixed false money with the Imperial coinage, and issued the same to the public;\n\n(4) That the Mayor\\(^3\\) of Kazwin was a receiver of bribes;\n\n(5) That the Superintendent of Police was in the habit of shelving cases preferred by the poor against the rich;\n\n(6) That the municipal officers neglected the streets of Kazwin,\n\nhe dismissed all those officials, and appointed reputable and worthy persons in their stead. Akhwand Samad, the M\u016bll\u0101 B\u0101sh\u012b, having heard from the jailor in the prison of the citadel that his post had been given to his rival M\u016bll\u0101 Ramaz\u0101n, died of vexation on the spot.\n\nY\u016bsuf Shah also gave orders that the streets of Kazwin should be widened, and that, for the safety of wayfarers, all open wells in the streets should be covered in. Arrangements were made for hearing and inquiring into petitions, and it was ordered that wheat should be supplied to the poor from the royal granaries. A committee was formed of men of experience and experts in waterworks to confer and consult regarding a water supply for Kazwin, and ordered to submit a written report of their proceedings and recommendations.\n\nAt that period, some of the people of Holland\\(^4\\) had\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Yel\u0101k\u2014The cool summer mountain resorts of the nomad tribes. The winter quarters are termed kishl\u0101k.\n\n\\(^2\\) Din\u0101r\u2014A nominal value equal to one-thousandth part of a ker\u0101n.\n\n\\(^3\\) Mayor\u2014Beglerbegi, a Turki term primarily meaning chief of chiefs.\n\n\\(^4\\) The Dutch as well as English and French had established factories at this time at Gombroon, at the entrance of the Peraian Gulf. In the year 1622, when the English aided the Persians to drive the Portuguese from the adjacent\noccupied a place in the vicinity of the Persian Gulf, and during these days an envoy from them with his suite arrived at Kazw\u00een, with a view to concluding a commercial treaty with the Government of Persia. The envoy and his suite were introduced to the presence of Y\u00fbsuf Shah, and were charmed and delighted by his wisdom, sagacity, statesmanship, and well-timed courtesies. After fully attaining the object of their mission, the envoy and suite were dismissed with presents, and returned entirely satisfied.\n\nA week had elapsed from the accession of Y\u00fbsuf Shah, and every day the people had been shown good deeds fraught with justice, and the signs of every kind of well-being were apparent. These were the halcyon days of prosperity and gladness in Ir\u00e2n; an era of happiness and good fortune had dawned. But \"cui bono?\" For the human race the day of happiness is ever transient. What, haply, was lacking or amiss to our father Adam and our mother Eve in Eden that they should have disobeyed God's commands and been driven forth from Paradise? Such is man!\n\nThe inhabitants of Kazw\u00een, no longer seeing mutilated portions of men's bodies hanging at the fort gate every day, nor beholding the wonted spectacle of the executioner putting men to death, gibbeting them, gouging out their eyes, and cutting off their ears and noses, thought matters had come to a strange pass indeed. At first they said: \"Undoubtedly this new king is very clement and forbearing.\" Afterwards they took to criticizing his mildness and humanity, and attributed this conduct to an indolent disposition and weakness of character. Furthermore, they discovered a thousand divers faults in Y\u00fbsuf Shah, the upshot of their talk being that life under the rule of a soft-hearted king like this seemed insufferably tedious.\n\nisland of Ormuz, the Shah ordered Gombroon to be named in future Bunder 'Abb\u00e2s, the name it has since borne.\n\n1 Mushakkah-h\u00e2-i-\u00c2dam\u2014The term is not found in dictionaries, but is derived from the Ar. shakk \"to split,\" \"rive,\" \"rip open,\" or \"sunder.\" Shakkah means a side of butcher's meat.\n\n2 B\u00fbrd-b\u00e2r.\nThe deposed officials guided the current of popular opinion into this channel, and, taking advantage of the favourable opportunity they saw, harboured designs of tumult and rebellion, and serious disturbances soon broke out in Kazwin.\n\nThe originator of these disturbances, in the first instance, was the dismissed Master of the Horse, who, having met the late Treasurer in the street, joined him in his walk and said: \"For God's sake, Mirz\u0101 Habib, tell me, for I want to know, what do the people say about our new king?\" Mirz\u0101 Hab\u012bb replied: \"The people do not like the new king; they are having a bitter time of it; they have come to the conclusion that he is imbecile and incompetent.\"\n\nThe Master of the Horse: \"By Allah! Mirz\u0101 Hab\u012bb, the people have more sense than ourselves, they say truly. In God's name! what folly is this we have committed, to have brought forward a low saddler, and made him our king? We have drawn trouble on our own heads. In return for our services he has deprived us of our posts. Now we are no more esteemed in the land than the street dogs. By Allah! nothing could be more ignominious than what we have done.\"\n\nThe Treasurer: \"Nay, we made him king by Shah 'Abb\u0101s' command: what choice had we then?\"\n\nThe Master of the Horse: \"True, but Shah 'Abb\u0101s was then king, and his orders were binding on us. But now that there is no Shah 'Abb\u0101s, what is there to prevent our casting this accursed freethinker (who they say, too, is a Pythagorean) down from the throne, and putting an end to him? Afterwards we can place on the throne a prince of the Safawi family, who will, at all events, be fitted for throne and crown by reason of his noble origin.\"\n\nThe Treasurer: \"You say well. I shall co-operate with you in this respect, but we are only two individuals, and what can we effect? Let us go to the Commandant of Artillery and ascertain his views; he, too, like ourselves is one of those deposed from office.\"\n\nThe two repair to the house of the Commandant of\nArtillery, who, greatly pleased at their visit, listens most eagerly to their communication, and fully agrees with them regarding an insurrection, but says that this affair cannot be carried into execution without the concurrence of B\u0101kir Kh\u0101n, commander of the Chagin cavalry.\n\nThe Commandant of Artillery: \"B\u0101kir Kh\u0101n is my particular friend, and I pledge myself to secure his cooperation with us in this undertaking. I shall say to him: 'The mishap which has befallen us in the days of the reign of this unbelieving Y\u016bsuf Shah will eventually fall on your head also. You had better provide against it beforehand.' I am certain this language will be effectual with him, for yesterday, at the public lev\u00e9e, the Shah was angry with, and rebuked him, so that he drank wine and went drunk to the mosque for prayers. If B\u0101kir Kh\u0101n agrees to join in this enterprise, Faraj Kh\u0101n, commander of the infantry, will also consent, for he is the cousin and son-in-law of B\u0101kir Kh\u0101n, and never does anything in opposition to him. But do you two get up and go to the late mayor of Kazwin, and, having obtained his concurrence, engage him to seek the deposed D\u0101roghah\u00b9 and the Kedkhod\u0101 to talk the matter over with them, and gain them over also.\"\n\nThe conspirators separate, and each sets about the accomplishment of this purpose, and they very soon succeeded in their object, as in the course of three or four days all those selected were informed, and, all being disposed for insurrection and ready for the fray, it was settled that they should surround the royal palace on Saturday morning, and, entering the inner apartments, cast Y\u016bsuf Shah down from the throne and put him to death; after which they would appoint a new king for themselves from the Safawi family.\n\nOn the morning of the appointed day, before the gate of the royal palace was opened, a large number of cavalry and infantry, in complete array, surrounded it on all sides. Y\u016bsuf Shah, being informed of the state of affairs, gave\n\n\u00b9 D\u0101roghah\u2014Town or Police Magistrate and Head of the City Police.\norders that the gates should not be opened. He had, indeed, expected such inequitable actions from the former M\u00fcll\u0101 B\u0101sh\u012b, Sird\u0101r Zem\u0101n Kh\u0101n, the late Waz\u012br, and Mustowf\u012b, the Munejjim B\u0101sh\u012b, and our master Jem\u0101l-ed-d\u012bn, who were powerful persons and openly hostile to him. It was for this reason that he had, at the outset of his reign, taken the precaution to throw them all into prison. But the door of ruin opened from another quarter.\n\nIn this juncture the well-wishers of Y\u016bsuf Shah, being apprised, armed themselves and hurried, minute by minute, in large numbers towards the palace, and confronting the insurgents began to reason with them, and to exhort them to desist from these proceedings, but to no avail. The matter passing beyond the stage of negotiation and conciliation, hostilities and fighting commenced, and in the m\u00eal\u00e9e which ensued both sides were reckless of their lives. From bullets they passed to swords and daggers, and, falling on each other, blood flowed like water. After three hours and a half of fierce fighting nearly six thousand men of both sides were killed and wounded. At length the party of Y\u016bsuf Shah showed symptoms of exhaustion and defeat; for the ungrateful populace kept issuing from the city and joining the ranks of the insurgents, adding to their numbers and strength. On this account the adherents of Y\u016bsuf Shah suffered defeat, and each one withdrew himself as best he could from the fray to save his own life. The insurgents, making a rush, broke in the gate of the Shah\u2019s palace and entered it, but howsoever they searched for Y\u016bsuf Shah they found him not. He had disappeared, and no trace of him was to be discovered. Some said that, during the fight, he had gone amongst his loyal adherents, encouraging them by his presence in the fray, and had been killed in the m\u00eal\u00e9e; others that he had concealed himself and escaped by flight. The essential point is that his body was not found amongst the slain. Howbeit no one thereafter pointed him out anywhere.\n\nThe insurgents plundered the royal palace, and thence, surging into the bazaar, looted the shops and caravanserais;\nfrom thence they hurried to the quarter of the Jews and Armenians, and ransacked and plundered all their houses, committing all sorts of outrages and excesses. The sun set. The tumult and pillage ceased, and everyone returned to his abode.\n\nThe next morning the leaders of the insurrection set out for the citadel, and having released from the prison Sird\u0101r Zem\u0101n Kh\u0101n, M\u012brz\u0101 Mohsin the Waz\u012br, M\u012brz\u0101 Yahy\u0101 the Mustowf\u012b, our master Jem\u0101l-ed-d\u012bn, and the Munejjim B\u0101sh\u012b, related to them what had happened, and inquired: \"Now which prince of the Safaw\u012b family do you consider most eligible for the throne and crown?\" Our master Jem\u0101l-ed-d\u012bn said: \"In God's name, tell me what day of the month is this?\" The Master of the Horse replied: \"To-day is the sixteenth day after the festival of Nowr\u016bz.\" Our master, manifesting his delight, said: \"Be no longer grieved; the tumult has occurred to the very day; it is clear the catastrophe is over. No one of the Safaw\u012b princes is fitted for the monarchy; they are all beardless and blind, some having been rendered so by Shah Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl the second, some by Shah \u2018Abb\u0101s himself; they are no longer eligible, and would not serve our purpose. Shah \u2018Abb\u0101s is still our king.\"\n\nThe Master of the Horse replied: \"We are well pleased with his kingly rule, and it went very happily with all of us during his time, but what good is that? Since he has abdicated the throne and crown, and disappeared from our sight, what can we do? Moreover, we know not where he is.\"\n\nOur master laughed and said: \"There was a reason for his abdication; lo! that reason no longer exists. We ourselves know his place of concealment. We shall go fetch him, and escort him to his own palace.\"\n\nAll arose and proceeded to the house in which Shah \u2018Abb\u0101s lay concealed, and bringing him forth conveyed him to the royal palace. He resumed his former position as Lord of the throne and crown, and matters settled down into the old course, as if nothing had happened.\nAuthor's Epilogue.\n\nI am amazed at the stupidity of these heavenly bodies, so deceived as they were by the people of Ir\u0101n, that they knew not that Y\u016bsuf Sarr\u0101j was not really Shah, but only a mock king set up to dupe them. Such simplicity and credulity as allowed the stars to be hoodwinked by the Persians was very wonderful. Strange, too, that they should cling to Shah \u2018Abb\u0101s, consign to his doom poor innocent Y\u016bsuf, the saddler, and thereafter for forty years behold with indifference the cruelty and tyranny of the former. Amongst the least conspicuous examples of the ruthlessness of Shah \u2018Abb\u0101s were his putting to death one of his own sons, and putting out the eyes of two others. Nor had he any other son, so a grandson became heir to his throne. However, there is no reason to blame the stars, which had no enmity towards Shah \u2018Abb\u0101s. It had become incumbent on them that fifteen days after the Nowr\u014dz they should depose an individual from the throne of Persia, and cause his ruin. Y\u016bsuf Sarr\u0101j was at that time seated on the throne of Persia; accordingly the stars brought to pass his fall and doom. It never occurred to the stars that the people of Ir\u0101n would trick them by such a stratagem, and that a mock king instead of the real one would succumb to their blow.\nART. XVI.\u2014The Li Sao Poem and its Author. By Professor Legge, Oxford.\n\nII. THE POEM.\n\nIn my former paper I endeavoured to set forth the principal events in the life of Ch'\u00fc Y\u00fcan, the author of the Li Sao Poem, as they are related in the biography of him by the historian Sze-m\u00e2 Ch'ien.\n\nI have now to describe the contents of the poem which he left as the principal memorial of himself. It is his longest poem, but it is not itself long, consisting only of 373 lines; and its literary value is but very middling. I agree in the estimate of it by the Marquis d'Herv\u00e9y, who says, \"The Chinese have little aptitude for the composition of poems of great extent, requiring method and invention. The admiration with which they regard the work of Ch'\u00fc Y\u00fcan is a proof to us of their inferiority in this respect. It would be useless to seek for a rival of Homer or of Virgil in the literature of this people, who, notwithstanding, have their Horace in the person of Li T'ai-po of our eighth century.\" The marquis, indeed, had a reason of his own for studying the Li Sao, but it is not necessary for me here to enter on any account or discussion of it, my object in this paper being simply to exhibit the contents of the poem, or what the reader is to look for in the perusal of it. In doing so, I will adopt the division of the piece which has been made by the Chinese critics themselves, into fourteen Sections, touching most of them with a light hand, and\n\n1 These divisions are given by the Marquis d'Herv\u00e9y at the conclusion of his translation of the poem. I have taken them from a note at the end of the \"Collection of Comments\" by Ling Ch'ien, styled Kao-chih (\u9675 \u9322 \u6a02 \u4e4b \u7c21 \u50b3), of the Tsin (\u6649) dynasty. He says at the close, \"The larger sections may also be subdivided into smaller ones, which the student can do for himself.\"\nspending my strength on the passages which seem to lead to important conclusions concerning the history of the nation, and others which indicate on the one hand the peculiarities of the writer's character, and on the other the fatuity\u2014I can think of no milder term\u2014of his understanding.\n\nI. The first Section consists of six stanzas, or twenty-four lines. The author tells us in it of his lineage, the date of his birth, and the names given to him by his father; of his earnest discharge of his official duties; and of his high aim, by self-cultivation, to form a character pure, beautiful, and righteous. He intimates also his dissatisfaction with king Hw\u00e2i, who was too readily accessible to worthless advisers, and kept aloof from himself and his better counsels.\n\nThe first stanza is,\n\n\"A descendant am I of the Ti K\u00e2o-yang.\nMy excellent deceased father was named Po-yung.\nWhen Sheh-t\u00ee (=the planet Jupiter) culminated in the first month of spring,\nOn k\u00e2ng-yin (=the 27th cycle-day) I was born.\"\n\nOught we to receive these statements as correct or even possible? The dynastic appellation of the Ti (or Emperor) styled K\u00e2o-yang\\(^1\\) was Chwan-hs\u00fc; and in a carefully prepared system of Chinese chronology by a Twan Hsi-y\u00e2i,\\(^2\\) published in 1817, his first year was B.C. 2510. He was, or is said to have been, a grandson of the emperor Hwang-T\u00ee, whose first year is put down as B.C. 2697. Chwan-hs\u00fc's rule must on this view be assigned to the lifetime of Noah, and placed before what we call \"The Deluge,\" according to the chronology of the Hebrew Bible,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) \u9ad8\u967d\u6c0f=\"He of K\u00e2o-yang.\" K\u00e2o-yang would be the name of the centre where he first ruled. There is still a district of that name in the department of P\u00e2o-ting, in Chih-l\u00ee, which appears in the \"Topography of different Dynasties\" as \"the Land of the ancient Chwan-hs\u00fc (\u53e4\u9853\u980a\u5730).\"\n\n\\(^2\\) \u6bb5\u897f\u58c1\u4e4b\u6b77\u4ee3\u4e8c\u5341\u56db\u53f2\u7d71\u7d00\u5168\u8868.\nas calculated by Calmet; or, if we prefer the estimates of Dr. Hales, based on the numbers in the Septuagint version of the Hebrew, it began about 350 years before the birth of Abraham.\n\nI am not prepared, however, absolutely to deny the statement of Ch'\u00fc Y\u00fcan on this ground. If we are to accept it, we must believe that his knowledge of his ancestry had been gained from some chronological data transmitted from that early time; and there is certainly some reason for our doing so. We are all aware that the Chinese cycle of time is arranged in periods of sixty years instead of being reckoned by hundreds like our own. It is made up of two series of what are for the most part short and easily written characters, one consisting of what are called ten stems,\\(^1\\) and the other of twelve branches.\\(^1\\) By joining the characters of these two series together, we obtain sixty combinations in which no two terms are the same, sixty being the least common multiple of ten and twelve. If we carry the combination on, we have simply to repeat the same operation; we have constituted the Chi\u00e0tsze\\(^2\\) cycle, the cycle of Chinese numeration;\u2014very ingenious indeed, while inferior to the use of our digits and cipher, which may be prolonged ad infinitum without any two terms being the same. This is the whole mystery, which is really no mystery, of the Chinese cycle. But how did the old fathers of the nation get the idea of the ten stems and twelve branches? and what led them to the formation of the simple characters by which these are represented? In a paper on Chinese Chronology written in 1891 I stated that I had been brooding over these questions without effect for many years. Since then, however, I have obtained considerable light on them from my friend Professor Gustave Schlegel, of the University of Leyden, a Chinese scholar of\n\n\\(^1\\) The ten stems are \u7532, \u4e59, \u4e19, \u4e01, \u620a, \u5df1, \u5e9a, \u8f9b, \u58ec, \u7678; and the twelve branches are \u5b50, \u4e11, \u5bc5, \u536f, \u8fb0, \u5df3, \u5348, \u672a, \u7533, \u9149, \u620c, \u4ea5.\n\n\\(^2\\) \u7532\u5b50.\ngreat attainments, and well versed also in astronomy and mathematics. According to him, the ten stems were made to denote the days in the decades of the month, each month being most naturally divided by the Chinese down to the present day into three decades. The same characters are also applied to other series of things besides the days of the decade. The different volumes, for instance, of a work in ten volumes might be marked with them from chi\u00e2 and yi down to s\u00e4n and kwei. As to their application to the days of the decade at a very early period, we have an instance of it in the words of the Great Y\u00fc,\\(^1\\) as recorded in the Sh\u00fb Ching, part II, iv, par. 8: \"When I married in T'\u00fb-shan, I remained with my wife only the days hsin, s\u00e4n, kwei, and chi\u00e2,\" which are the last three and the first of the stems.\n\nSo much for the stems. Professor Schlegel has given an equally satisfactory account of the twelve branches. Their names, he says, were originally employed to denote the months of the year, and he seems to me to establish this clearly in his \"Uranographie Chinoise,\" pp. 37 seq. The character representing each month was significant of its quality or character. That the year consisted, anciently as now, in China of twelve months of thirty days each and a fraction of a day, appears from the address of the sovereign Yao to his astronomers, assigned to the year B.C. 2357: \"A round year,\" he said to them, \"consists of 366 days. By means of an intercalary month do you fix the four seasons, and complete the determination of the year. By regulating the proceedings of the various officers in accordance with this, all the business of the year will be fully performed.\"\\(^2\\)\n\nThe more I study the Chinese year of more than 2000 years before the birth of Christ, the more am I led to think of the year adopted by the first French Republic in 1793, and the names given to its months. The French names and\n\n\\(^1\\) Y\u00fc was a descendant of Chwan-hs\u00fc, from whom our author also claimed descent. He became sovereign in B.C. 2217.\n\n\\(^2\\) See the Sh\u00fb Ching, Part I, paragraph 8.\nthe Chinese names, of course, are different, but the meaning of the differently sounding terms is in several of them very much the same. We find the equivalents of a Fructidor, a Messidor, and a Vend\u00e9miaire among the Chinese names. I ask if it be more wonderful to discover such an arrangement of the year and nomenclature of its months in China 2000 years and more before the birth of Christ, than to find the same arrangement and a similar nomenclature of its months being adopted in France nearly 2000 years after the birth of Christ. I cannot, therefore, because of that first line in the Li Sao brand the whole poem and the history of its author as baseless and absurd. I do not think that Ch'\u00fc Y\u00fcan was writing without authority and without book, when he said that he was descended from Chwan-hs\u00fc, who ruled in China B.C. 2510.\n\nThere is another question suggested by the third and fourth lines of the stanza, which is as perplexing as that which we have been considering about the origin of the cycle. The fourth line tells us that Ch'\u00fc Y\u00fcan was born on the k\u00e4ng-yin, or 27th, day of the cycle. There is no difficulty about that; but in what year was he born? The third line says it was when the planet Jupiter culminated in the first month of spring. Possibly a skilful astronomer and mathematician may approximate at least to a determination of this year; but it is beyond my power to do so, and I have not attempted it. I showed in my former paper that we can historically come very near to the year of Ch'\u00fc's death; but the year of his birth is hidden from us, excepting as he has told it to us in this line, which he has done in a peculiar way. He says that he was born \"when Sheh-t'i culminated in the first month of spring.\" Now Sheh-t'i is a foreign name, having no suitable meaning in Chinese. It is employed, however, to denote the planet Jupiter, which, moreover, is generally called the \"Year Star.\"\n\nTo find our way through this puzzle, we must bear in mind that the cycle characters of which I have spoken were made to denote days and not years. To use the words\nof the Rev. Dr. Chalmers,\u00b9 \u201cNot a single instance of the application of the cycle to years can be found till after the classical period, and this fact is sufficient to satisfy us that this invaluable method of dating years was never used in ancient times. The first attempt to arrange the years in cycles of sixty is found in the 26th Book of Sze-m\u00e2 Ch\u2019ien\u2019s History, in the form of a table constructed for the purpose of intercalation, and extending over a period of 76 years, the first year being B.C. 104. This cycle consists like that for days of ten stems and twelve branches. It is called Sheh-t\u2019t K\u00eah, or cycle of Sheh-t\u2019t; but all its terms are phonetizations of disyllabic and trisyllabic words from some foreign language.\u201d From what language they were taken has not yet been made out. Knowing that the Sanskrit name for the Regent of the planet Jupiter is Vrihaspati, and dividing that word into Vriha and spati, and knowing that Ch\u2019ien\u2019s Sheh-t\u2019t was pronounced in Cantonese as Sh\u0131p-t\u2019ai, I thought I had got to the solution of the mystery; on referring, however, to a Sanskrit-English Dictionary, I found that the mythological name Vrihaspati was analyzed into Vrihas-pati, meaning \u201cLord of Prayer.\u201d It was thus impossible that the Sheh-t\u2019t could be derived from the Sanskrit name for the Regent of Jupiter, and the illusion of my fancied discovery melted away. Nevertheless, the origin of the ten disyllabic foreign names of Ch\u2019ien\u2019s stems, and of the nine disyllabic and three trisyllabic names of his branches is still to seek. I hope that it may soon be found.\n\nA valuable work called Kala Sankalita was published at Madras in 1825 by a Lieutenant-Colonel John Warren. It is \u201ca collection of memoirs of the various modes according to which the nations of the southern parts of India divide time.\u201d There is in it an account of the Hindu cycle of sixty, \u201cthe origin of which is unknown,\u201d but the author appends to it the following note:\u2014\u201cIn the cycle of sixty are contained five cycles of twelve years,\n\n\u00b9 In his essay on \u201cThe Astronomy of the Ancient Chinese,\u201d in my Chinese Classics, Vol. III, proleg. p. 97 seq.\neach supposed to equal one year of the planet (Jupiter). I only mention this cycle because I find it mentioned in some books, but I know of no nation or tribe that reckons time after that account\u201d (p. 212). It is to be regretted that Colonel Warren had not heard of the Chia-tse cycle of China, which is made up of five cycles of twelve years. If at first and for long it was only applied to the succession of days, the cumbrous system for years proposed by Sze-ma Ch\u2019ien soon ceased, notwithstanding his authority, to hold its ground; and after the year A.D. 21 it disappears nearly altogether from Chinese literature, and gave place to the terms of the native cycle for days as applied also to years.\n\nIt is high time that I should leave this first stanza, and proceed with the analysis of the poem. As I have said, I accept lines one and two as historical; and I must leave three and four till more light has been thrown on them.\n\nOf the names which our author received from his father I need not now speak. He describes his earnest self-cultivation and discharge of his official duties under the figure of being fond of, and gathering and wearing, flowers. The most brilliant in colour, the most delicate in fragrance, and those yielding the most delicious taste are all collected by him and worn at his girdle. Orchids and angelicas, the cassia, the pepper-plant, and many others are gathered by him and cherished as symbolical of the attributes of mind and character which fitted him to serve his king and country. This is one of the chief characteristics of the poem, and it abounds also in symbolism of other forms. Where he complains, for instance, of king Hwai\u2019s want of appreciation of him, it is under the figure of a lover complaining that the object of his or her admiration is failing to keep their promised tryst.\n\nII. The second Section of the poem contains thirty-two lines, and will not require much elucidation. There are mentioned in it first the methods of the founders of the three great feudal dynasties, and their glorious predecessors, Yao and Shun. These all welcomed to their presence the\nwise and the good, receiving and following their counsels. With their methods there are contrasted the courses of the two cruel and abandoned sovereigns, Chieh and Ch'\u00e2u, with whom the dynasties of Hsi\u00e2 and Shang ended, and their disastrous results. The poet then shows the difference between himself and his envious opponents, and deplores the king's course. His own way was always in the line of what was right, and was the outcome of his loving loyalty. Glad would he have been to be recalled to the court, and be received there as the king's adviser. But his efforts to bring this about were of no avail. Notwithstanding his earnest appeals to Heaven in confirmation of his truth,\n\n\"The king made no account of the loyal feelings of his heart,\nBut believed the slanderers, and burned with anger against him.\"\n\nWhat would the end be, not for himself, but for the throne and kingdom?\n\nIII. The third Section is very short, occupying only eight lines. It gives very fully, in floral metaphor, a description of the author's self-culture, and laments the failure of his hopes. He was disliked and hated the more because of his fragrant virtues.\n\nIV. The fourth Section, in twenty-eight lines, sets forth how, while the king's favourites were eager only for their material ends, Ch'\u00fc Y\u00fcan's wish was to leave a good name behind him. He would never give up nor regret his course, though nine deaths should await him. He intimates, indeed, in one line that the idea of terminating his disappointments by suicide, which we saw in the former paper that he did in the end, was being revolved by him. He says,\n\n\"Not agreeing with the practice of the men of to-day,\nI wish to imitate the pattern handed down by P'\u00e4ng Hsien.\"\n\nThis P'\u00e4ng Hsien was, it is believed, a worthy Great officer of the Yin dynasty, who, when his words of remonstrance\nwere not listened to by his sovereign, committed suicide by drowning himself.\n\nV. The fifth Section, in twelve lines, is occupied with angry references to the king's indifference to him, and to the malicious abuse of him by the courtiers. He is the beauty of the harem with her silkworm eyebrows, and they are her envious associates who dislike and vilify her. They are, moreover, like foolish builders whose work comes to nothing through their stupidity. Sudden death would be more welcome to him than to act as they did.\n\nVI. The sixth Section, in thirty-two lines, shows how impossible it was for the author and his enemies to associate; as impossible as for what was square and what was round to fit together, as for two to walk together when they are not agreed. Some expressions in it lead us to think that, when banished from the court, he had gone back and tried in vain to propitiate the king. He had then retired and cultivated his old habits, and would continue to do so. All at once the thought occurred to him that he would travel, and see \"the most distant regions in all directions.\" Peradventure he might somewhere meet with a worthy sovereign, who would welcome his counsels and accept his guidance, or with some good ministers with whom he could cordially co-operate. This gives the key-note to the greater part of the poem which follows; whatever the result might be to himself, though his body were dismembered, he would not change either his principles or his course.\n\nVII. The seventh Section, in twelve lines, is an interesting episode, in which \"the lovely sister\" of the author appears, expostulating with him on the dangerous obstinacy of his course. There is a tradition that Ch'\u00fc Y\u00fcan's ancestral home was in what is now, I believe, the district of Hsing-shan in Kwei-ch\u00e2u, of the \u00ce-ch'ang department of H\u00fb-pei (\u6e56\u5317\u5b9c\u660c\u5e9c\u6b78\u5dde\u8208\u5c71), and that on the north-east of the site there used to be, perhaps is now, a temple to this sister. Hearing of her brother's disgrace and trouble, she now came to him, all the people hoping she would succeed in inducing him to change his way. She reminds him of the\nfate of their ancestor Kw\u0103n, a descendant, like themselves, of Chwan-hs\u00fc, and the father of the famous Y\u00fc. Kw\u0103n is mentioned in the first two books of the Sh\u00fb Ching, as disliked by Y\u00e2o, and kept till his death a prisoner by Shun. We form a more unfavourable opinion of him from the references to him in the Sh\u00fb than we do from the language of the lady; but this is favourable rather than unfavourable to the genuineness of what she says about their ancestor. Her expostulation, however, produced no change in her brother.\n\nVIII. We pass on to the eighth Section of the poem, containing forty lines. We saw in Section VI how there had suddenly come into our author's mind the idea of visiting \"the most distant regions,\" and searching in them for a sovereign and ministers to his mind. The time might seem to have come for him to carry this purpose into effect; but he thought again that he would first like to test the correctness of his views by those of the ancient sages, and in order to do this he would visit the grave of the ancient sovereign Shun, whose plenary occupation of the throne dates in chronology from B.C. 2255 to 2217. He died in one of his progresses to the south, and two sites, one in H\u00fb-nan and the other in Kwang-h\u00eai, are claimants for the place of his grave. Our author seems to have sought for it in a district so-called, comprehended in T\u00e2o-ch\u00e2u in the department of Yung Ch'\u00e2u of H\u00fb-nan. There, at some point on the hill of Chi\u00fb-t, or \"Nine Doubts\" (so-called from the great similarity of so many peaks in the mountain's ridge), he knelt, with his skirt outspread near the grave, and poured out his complaint, mournfully unfolding the exercises of his mind. He speaks of Shun by the name of Ch'ung-hw\u00e2, given to him also in the Sh\u00fb Ching, though there has been, and still is, some difference of opinion as to the meaning of the denomination. Briefly and imperfectly, but not incorrectly, he sketched the history of the dynasties of Hsi\u00e2 and Shang, showing how they rose by the virtues of their founders, and fell by the vices of their last sovereigns. The former were good and cherished their good ministers,\nthe latter were bad and persecuted their good ministers. From those references he ascended to the impartiality of Heaven, verifying a sentence which, no doubt, he had read in the T\u00e2o-t\u00eah Ching of L\u00e2o-tse. At the close of the 79th chapter of that Work we find: \"In the way of Heaven there is no partiality of love; it is always on the side of the good man\"; and this appears in the Li S\u00e2o, as\n\n\"August Heaven has no private partialities;\nIt observes the qualities of men, and dispenses its help accordingly.\nIt is only the conduct fully ordered by sage wisdom\nWhich can obtain rule on this earth below.\"\n\nAll observation of men and times confirms the judgment that is thus given, and Ch'\u00fc Y\u00fcan adds,\n\n\"Looking back to the earlier and contemplating the later times,\nWe obtain a complete view of Heaven's dealings with men.\nWho without righteousness was ever fit to be employed?\nWho without goodness was ever fit to direct affairs?\"\n\nKneeling by the grave of Shun on his outspread skirt, our author thus made his plaint. No answer, of course, came to him from the spirit of the ancient sovereign; but he obtained a clear conviction that his views were true and correct. Sighing and sobbing, he could only bewail that the time was so unsuitable for him. He held his soft orchids to hide the tears which fell in torrents, and wetted the lapel of his dress. The time had come for him to commence the great journey which he had thought of.\n\nIX. We have come to the ninth and much the longest Section of the poem, occupying seventy-six lines. A strange medley it is, and Ch\u00fb Hsi, the incomparable scholar and critic of his country, interjects at this point the remark that \"many of the descriptions in it are imaginary, and we are not to suppose that there were\nsuch things in reality, or that such occurrences took place.\"\n\nThe chief place in the journey is occupied by the K'w\u0103n-lun range of mountains, which still awaits the investigation of the scientific explorer. Starting near what is called \"the Pushtikur knot,\" in lat. 36\u00b0 N., it runs easterly over nearly the whole breadth of the high table-land between India and China, dividing, in part of its course, Thibet from the sands or desert of Gobi. The two great rivers of China, the Hwang Ho or Yellow River, and the Yang-tsze Chiang, and other streams as well, take their rise at the foot of its spurs at no great distance from one another.\n\nThe name K'w\u0103n-lun is found in the Sh\u00fb, in connection with the labours of Y\u00fc (more than 2000 years B.C.), but simply as the denomination of a wild tribe in the far west, whose seat may have been near the foot of the mountain-range, which was not then the famous place in Chinese mythology which it afterwards became. In Lieh-tsz\u00e9, not long after the time of Confucius, and in later T\u00e2oist writers, it appears as a sort of Olympus and Fairy-land; and is described as consisting of peak rising above peak to a height of more than 3000 miles! Trees, flowers, and fruits grow upon it, of marvellous kind; trees of pearls, of jade-stone, and of the fruit of immortality. It is peopled also, being the abode of genii and spirits, and the seat of the Royal Mother of the West, at the head of her fairy attendants; yea, of the rulers or gods of the Elements also, with their legions of Immortals. Mayers, in his article on K'w\u0103n-lun, quotes, from the \"Gatherings of Matters Omitted in the History of the Past (\u62fe\u907a\u8a18),\" which is not a work of great authority, a statement that \"Mount K'w\u0103n-lun is called in the west Mount Sum\u00earu\"; but I do not wish to enter here on the discussion of a connection between the mythologies of India and China. Sum\u00earu is merely a dream of fancy, while K'w\u0103n-lun has a very substantial\n\n1 Ch. Cl. III, Bk. I, Pt. i, 83.\nexistence, though a mass of fables has gathered about its heights and recesses.\n\nBut how shall Ch'\u00fc Y\u00fcan ascend the great mountain, and accomplish the journey across it? After his communing with the spirit of Shun, next morning apparently, there appeared to him a car in the form of a phoenix-bird, to which were yoked four unhorned dragons, smooth as jade, and in this, through dust and wind, he suddenly ascended on high. The phoenix-bird which thus becomes a car is denoted by a peculiar character (\u9cf3, called \u4ea2), but we are not to think of it as other than a real phoenix, which, of course, is a fabulous bird; and, in the \"Classic of Hills and Seas\" (i, p. 7), it is thus described: \"On the hill of Cinnabar Caves there is a bird like a fowl, with plumage variegated, and exhibiting various characters. On its head there is the character Virtue (=Goodness); on the wings Righteousness; on its breast Benevolence; on its back Propriety; and on its belly Good Faith. When it eats and drinks, it of itself sings and dances. When it is seen, the whole world is at rest and quiet. It is called \u7ffc\u7687, \u7ffc being the designation of the male, and \u7687 of the female.\"\n\nThen this phoenix-car is drawn by a team of four dragons. But the dragon is the symbol employed by the Chinese to denote \"the superior man\" and \"the great man.\" It has always been the emblem with them of the highest dignity and sagehood. I must believe that in the ascending car, with its phoenix and dragons, we have the symbol of our author himself, good and able, untiringly rising above the reach and aim of meaner men, and not to be contented with less than the attainment of his own lofty ambition. This view gives a sort of unity to the poem, instead of its being merely a fantastic compound of membra disjecta, with no internal connection.\n\nI hasten on from the car and its team to the journey. In the morning our hero started from Ts'ang-w\u00fb, and towards the evening he came to Hs\u00fcan-p\u00fb, the second of the three stages into which the whole ascent of the mountain\nwas divided. According to Nan-hw\u00e2i Tsze, \"He who gets to the first stage is beyond the reach of death; he who gets to the second stage becomes powerful, and can summon wind and rain at his pleasure; and he who gets to the topmost stage becomes a spiritual being.\" At the second peak our traveller was confronted by a gate sculptured like that of a royal residence, and he wished to stay a little and enter, but the day was hastening to a close.\n\nEager to get on in his search for the right sovereign, the author tells us,\n\n\"I ordered Hsi and Ho to delay the stages of the sun,\nAnd not to hurry on as they made for Yen-tsz\u00e9!\nThe way was very long, and distant was my goal:\nI would ascend and descend, pursuing my search.\"\n\nHsi and Ho are here the charioteers of the Sun, so named after the astronomers of the ancient Y\u00e2o, who appear in the first Book of the Sh\u00fb Ching. About 200 years after Y\u00e2o we find astronomers of the same name, also in the Sh\u00fb, and threatened with death by king Chung-k'ang of the Hsi\u00e2 dynasty for having neglected their duty.\n\nHere we find the charioteers of the Sun called by their names about 2000 years later, mythology having assigned that office to them at some time during the long intervening period. Our hero, anxious to pursue his search, orders\n\n1 Wang Y\u00ee, quoting from a description of K'w\u0103n-lun, says: \"There are three stages of it. The lowest stage is called Pan-t'ung (\u6a0a \u6850), and also Pan-tung (\u677f \u6a39); the second He\u00fban-p\u00fb (\u7384 \u5716), and also Lang-feng (\u862d \u98a8); the last T'\u00eang-ch'\u00eang (\u5c64 \u57ce), and also T'ien-t'\u00eang (\u5929 \u5ead).\"\n\n2 The name of the peak is written variously. The better text for it is \u7e23 \u5716, but \u61f8, \"to suspend,\" is also found, and the Marquis d'Hervey, adopting this, translates: \"Le soir j'arrivais aux jardins suspendus de He\u00fban-p\u00fb.\" The \u7e23 is pronounced like \u7384, and Williams describes \u7384 \u5716 as \"an elysium in the K'w\u0103n-lun mountains, where the Heavenly Ruler resides,\" and Gilee similarly calls it \"a peak of the K'w\u0103n-lun mountains, where God resides.\" But neither the \"Heavenly Ruler\" of the one nor \"the God\" of the other is to be understood of the Confucian Shang T\u00ee.\nthem to drive slowly, and not to hurry on to the mountain Yen-tze,\\(^1\\) when the day would be over, for the sun was supposed to enter this mountain, and plunge into the waters at the foot of it.\n\nThus ends the first day's journey; and next morning we discover Ch'\u00fc in the region of the rising sun! He tells us nothing about how he had got there; we are at our wits' end in trying to realize his progress. We left him in the dusk of the evening drawing near to the hill of Yen-tze,\\(^1\\) which he has gone into in his car and so been hidden from our view; and next morning he is before us in the far east, in the country of the rising sun.\n\nIn the fiftieth stanza we read,\n\n\"I watered my horses at the pool of Hsien;\nI gathered up and tied the reins to a F\u00fb-sang tree;\nI broke off a branch from a Zo tree to hold against the sun,\nAnd thus I enjoyed myself, aimlessly rambling.\"\n\n\"The pool of Hsien\" is a name variously applied. Wang Y\u00ec defines it here as \"the place where the sun bathed,\" for which Ch\u00fb Hsi has \"the place where the sun descended,\" meaning, no doubt, the pool into which the sun plunged after passing through Yen-tze hill. The other applications of the name need not be mentioned here.\n\nF\u00fb-sang is the name of a tree at the foot of which the sun was said to re-appear in the morning, as by Hw\u00e2i-nan Tsze (Book iii, p. 12\\(^a\\)). Of course it was to be found in the east; and at a later time it came to be applied to a country of the east, which not a few speculators in these\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See the account of this mountain in the \"Classic of Hills and Seas,\" at the end of the second book, with all the references to it in Wang Y\u00ec \\textit{in loc}. One account of it, given also in the K'ang-h\u00ea Dictionary, is that it lay southwest from the Niao Sh\u00fb T'ung Hsieh Hill, mentioned in the Sh\u00fb (III, i, pt. i, 76), which would take us to the department of Lan-ch\u00e2u, in Kan-s\u00fb; but how could the car be advancing on and aloft from Hs\u00fcan-p\u00fb and down in Kan-s\u00fb? [As to the name of the hill, \"Bird and Rat occupying the same Hole,\" in 1873 I saw a little owl in the mouth of a rat's or some other animal's hole, a little way from Merced, in California. I thought at once of the name in the Sh\u00fb. Afterwards I was told that the phenomenon was common in California.]\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1895.\nlater times have maintained to be America, in the discovery of which the Chinese would thus have anticipated Columbus by more than a thousand years.\n\nNor is this all. Our author, having tied his horses, the four unhorned dragons, to a f\u00fb-sang, proceeded to pluck a branch from another fabulous tree, called the Zo (Hw\u00e2i-nan Tsze, Book iv, p. 3b), the brightness of whose flowers was said to illumine the ground below it. Armed with this as a protection against the sun, he rested for a time, and sauntered leisurely about, enjoying himself.\n\nBut he did not rest long. We soon see him en route again; and he is assisted by certain mythological personages, who still maintain their places in the sacrificial canon of China.\u00b9 Before him he sent Wang Sh\u00fb, the charioteer of the Moon, as his precursor, and behind him hurried Fei-lien,\u00b2 the earl or master of the Wind. There were also in attendance the lwan, a fabulous bird, of brilliant plumage, generally associated, as here, with the ph\u0153nix, and the Thunder-master, called F\u0103ng-lung, which is described by Hw\u00e2i-nan Tsze as \u201ccoming forth in the last month of spring to regulate the rains (iii, p. 19b).\u201d\n\nEncouraged by having such assistants, Ch\u2018\u00fc Y\u00fcan ordered his ph\u0153nix, for the bird here displaces the car, to soar aloft, and continue its flight day and night, so intent is he to prosecute his search. All at once, however, he is met by a whirlwind, bringing with it a crowd of opponents, who came to meet and resist him, as so many clouds and rainbows. His bright hopes were thus overcast. The appearance of a rainbow has always been deemed unpromising by the Chinese.\u00b3 What was Ch\u2018\u00fc Y\u00fcan to do? While the opposing host now separated and now divided in great confusion, here ascending and there descending, he seems to have succeeded in attaining the topmost height of the mountain; and, reaching the gate of Heaven, he\n\n\u00b9 Compare with this assertion the offerings made to nearly all these personages as taken from the Ming statutes in my \u201cNotions of the Chinese concerning God and Spirits,\u201d pp. 34, 35.\n\u00b2 See the Historical Records of the Ch\u2018in dynasty, near the beginning.\n\u00b3 See the Shih-ching, I, iv, Ode 7, and the notes on it.\nwould have entered and made his appeal to God, but when he ordered the porter to open, that surly minister only leant against the door and looked at him.\n\nDenied admission to God, Ch'\u00fc felt more than he had done, that the time was dark and dreary for him. Still he maintained his purity. Even in that region he found orchids to gather; deploring how the good were kept in obscurity, and he himself was the object of jealousy and envy. When morning dawned, he was still in the region of the K'w\u0103n-lun, and he saw the stream of the White Water,\\(^1\\) one of those to which a reference has already been made, as rising amid the spurs of the mountain, being that which is said to flow towards China, and becomes the Hwang Ho or Yellow River, on entering it. Across the stream, he directed his car up to Lang-f\u0103ng, a height of the peak, and there tethered his horses. This done, all at once he looked back, and was moved to shed tears, lamenting that \"on the lofty height there was no lady for him.\" \"He looked back,\" we may well suppose that it was on the kingdom of Ch'\u00fc from which he had flown; but the sudden introduction of a young lady as the object of his search is strange; and we hesitate to accept Ch\u00fb Hsi's interpretation that she is now the emblem of \"the worthy ruler,\" whom he was seeking for, or even to adopt Wang Yi's interpretation that the lady stands to our hero for worthy ministers, like-minded with himself.\n\nAt this point we might make a subdivision of the long section of the poem which has thus far occupied us. We are suddenly transferred from the highest western region of the K'w\u0103n-lun range away to the far East, where in the sky was the residence of the Green god (\u9752\u5e1d). That the reader may understand this, I must ask him to peruse in my \"Notions of the Chinese concerning God and Spirits\" what I wrote in 1852 concerning the Five T\u00ees or gods, which appeared in China towards the end of the Ch\u00e2u dynasty. They were the spirits presiding over the\n\n\\(^1\\) The White Water is mentioned also by Chwang-tse (Bk. xii, par. 1), but with no reference to its place, and apparently with a metaphorical signification.\nFive Elements, the Five Planets, and other numerical categories of Five Terms, and were denominated the Five Tis or gods. It was not till the reign of the emperor W\u0103n (\u6587\u5e1d, B.C. 179\u2013157) of the first Han dynasty, that these Tis were elevated and styled Shang-Tis. The great scholar Ch\u0103ng Hs\u00fcan (A.D. 127\u2013200) styled them the Green, the Red, the Yellow, the White, and the Black Ti.\u00b9\n\nThe Green god presided over the eastern quarter, the Spring, and the planet Jupiter, and was called Ling-weiyang,\u00b2 the origin of which name has not yet been discovered. The whole thing was of T\u00e2oist origin (original or derived) in Chinese literature, and, being adopted by the Han emperors and the great scholar mentioned above, continued as an intrusion into the Confucian teaching, until it was swept away under the Ming dynasty, to whose decision the present dynasty has adhered.\n\nOur author, then, is now at the palace of the Spring; and, rambling about it, he finds a jade-stone tree, nearly \"2000 feet high, and thirty outspread arms in circumference.\"\u00b3 He breaks off a branch of this tree to attach to his girdle, and wishes to see the attendant of the lady to present to her the offering that would be preliminary to a union between him and her. We do not know what lady he had in mind. He has told us that on the loftiest height of K\u2018w\u0103n-lun there was no lady for him. No doubt, I think, the one he has now in mind is the lady F\u00fb mentioned in the next stanza. He cannot afford to lose any time. He wishes to effect the union with her as representing the worthy sovereign whom he sought, while he was yet in vigour, and before the glorious flower of his\n\n\u00b9 See Chalmers's \"Origin of the Chinese,\" chapter ii, pp. 24-29; and Mayers' Manual, part ii, on \"Numerical Categories,\" under \"Five,\" 149, 160, 169, etc.\n\n\u00b2 \u7075\u5a01\u4ef0. The \u7075 is probably used as an adjective, meaning \"intelligent\" or \"efficacious.\"\n\n\u00b3 Such is the size of the tree as given by Wang Y\u00ee; Mayers, art. 317, makes it larger.\nyouth had all fallen. The attendant lady may represent any minister enjoying that sovereign\u2019s confidence.\n\nOur author then ordered the Thunder-master, mentioned already and here called by his name of F\u0103ng-lung, to mount on the clouds and search for the place where the lady F\u00fb was. He also unloosed the string of his girdle, which, with all the ornaments attached to it, would serve as the gage of his truth, and ordered Ch\u2019ien-hsi\u00fb (\u8e47\u4fee) to transact the affair for him. All this appears to us very absurd. The lady F\u00fb was a fabled daughter of F\u00fb Hsi, with whose reign anything like the line of Chinese sovereigns commences, so that she must have lived about 3000 years before Ch\u2019\u00fc Y\u00fcan came into the world. The story about her, according to Wang Yi, is that she was drowned in the Lo, and came to be regarded as the tutelary spirit of that river. Ch\u2019ien-hsi\u00fb, who was to act as go-between in arranging for the union between our hero and her, is supposed to have been a minister of F\u00fb Hsi.\n\nThe mission of Ch\u2019ien-hsi\u00fb proved to be as ineffectual as had been the attempt of the author to find admission to the Elysium of Hs\u00fcan-p\u00fb (see stanza 53); and the failure in both cases is told in much the same way. The first statements in both stanzas are exactly the same, and the second are built on the same lines. Opposition, not to be overcome, is encountered, and Ch\u2019\u00fc is compelled in the evening to return to the earth again, and halt for the night at the hill of Ch\u2019iung-shih, which is to be found in the present district of Chang-yeh, belonging to the department Kan-ch\u00e2u of Kan-s\u00fb. Here had been the principality of the famous archer I, mentioned in Ch\u2019\u00fc\u2019s communing with the spirit of Shun at his grave, and near the foot of which the Weak-water took its rise. There he spent the night, and in the morning he bathed his hair in the stream W\u00eai-p\u2019an, which, probably, was not far off.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 The Weak-water is mentioned twice in the Sh\u00fb (III, i, pt. i, par. 73; and pt. ii, par. 5), in the notes to which the reader will find collected all that we thus far know about it. See also \u201cHw\u00e2i-nan Tsze,\u201d iv, p. 34.\nIn the course of that day, we may suppose, he heard, probably from Ch\u2018ien-hsi\u00fb, a bad account of the lady F\u00fb\u2019s character. Beautiful she was, but haughty, pleasure-seeking, and regardless of propriety. He gave up all thought of her, and would prosecute his search elsewhere. And where did that search lead him? In his inspection he surveyed the earth to its four extremities; he travelled also all over the sky, and came down again to the earth. Then, a long way off, he saw the lofty tower which the Lord of Sung had caused to be built of the finest materials for his beautiful daughter, who afterwards became the favourite lady of the emperor K\u2018\u00fb, and gave birth to Hsieh, the father of the Shang dynasty. We are not to think of the duchy of Sung in the time of the Ch\u00e2u dynasty in connection with this lady. The Chinese names for the two principalities, though similarly pronounced, are quite different. The lady\u2019s name has come down to us as Chien-t\u00ee, mentioned in the fourth of the \u201cSacrificial odes of Shang,\u201d for the son whom she bore to the Emperor K\u2018\u00fb, became, as said above, the ancestor of the sovereigns of the dynasty of Shang. As the reign of K\u2018\u00fb is placed between B.C. 2432 and 2362, the absurdity of Ch\u2018\u00fc\u2019s thinking of a union with her is hardly less great than that of his former desire for the daughter of F\u00fb Hsi, nor are the other details of the courtship less ridiculous. He sent his proposals to her by Ch\u00e2n, the name of the secretary-falcon, which is said to be so poisonous, that even water in which its feathers have been steeped causes the death of those who drink it. This strange go-between, by whom must be intended one of Ch\u2018\u00fc\u2019s most virulent slanderers, brought him back word that the lady was not good. And another, smaller, opponent of the same character came in, and, under the semblance of a jackdaw or a cuckoo, screamed out the lady\u2019s faults; but the suitor only detested their furtive cunning.\n\nFull of doubt and mistrust, he would fain have gone and made his proposals in person; but that was forbidden by the rules of propriety. And then it occurred to him\nthat K\u00e2o-hsin, which was the personal appellation of Ti K'\u00fb, must have sent the phoenix to Chien-t\u00ee, and that thus his own desire for her had been anticipated by that ancient sovereign.\n\nThus, disappointed a second time, our hero wished to settle somewhere far away, but he knew not where to go to, nor was he contented to ramble about and idly enjoy himself. Ha! he thinks of Sh\u00e2o-k'ang, the fourth of the line of Y\u00fc, who ruled the dynasty of Hsi\u00e2, and of the Yao ladies who became his wives; but he does not consider that they had all been gone from the world nearly as long as Chien-t\u00ee! The murder of Sh\u00e2o-k'ang's father and the escape of his mother have been mentioned under stanza 39. The lady fled to her father's principality of Z\u00e2ng, and next year gave birth to her son, who grew up in obscurity, till, in his 22nd year, he was obliged to flee to Y\u00fc, the state from which Shun had sprung, and whose rulers had the surname of Yao. By-and-by, after he had acted as cook in the ruler's household, his quality and merits were recognized, and he received the ruler's daughters in marriage, along with a city and territory. He continued to prosper, and ere long was able to overcome Ao, the strong son of the usurper Han-cho, and regained the throne of Hsi\u00e2. All this is interesting, but what had Ch'\u00fc P'ing to do with Sh\u00e2o-k'ang and his wives?\n\nHe did, indeed, become more than half convinced that his search for a good king and for worthy ministers like-minded with himself, was likely to be fruitless. He says,\n\n\"The age is one of confusion and greed, and of hatred of the wise and good;\nAll love to keep the excellent in obscurity, and to see the bad raised to distinction.\"\n\nGood colleagues being so difficult to find, and king Hw\u00e2i, whom he calls \"the wise king,\" not awaking to a sense of his duty, he comes to the conclusion \"to cherish his\nviews in his breast and not express them. How could he bear to associate with such people to the long end?\"\n\nX. We have come to the end of the longest division of the poem, and go on to the tenth Section of it, which occupies twenty lines. The marvellous journey or journeys up and down K\u2018w\u00e4n-lun had given our author no satisfaction, and to guide him in his future course he had recourse to divination. He collects materials for the operation,\u2014plants of the Hibiscus Syriacus, and splinters of bamboo; and obtains the presence of Ling-f\u0103n, a noted diviner of old, to interpret the result for him. How the operation was performed we do not know, but the interpretation was that the \"two Beauties,\" meaning Ch\u2018\u00fc himself and the good patron of whom he was in search, were sure to come together, but not in the kingdom of Ch\u2018\u00fc. Who would believe in his self-culture and desire him? He should consider the vast extent of the nine regions of the country, and go elsewhere. In what place were there no fragrant plants? Why should he keep on thinking only of his old abode?\n\nTo this counsel Ch\u2018\u00fc Y\u00fcan responds that the age was dull and dark, and liable to be dazzled by what was bright, so that he knew not who would carefully examine his merit. People everywhere differed in their likings and dislikings, but his opponents in Ch\u2018\u00fc were quite peculiar. The partizans in Ch\u2018\u00fc, in fact, preferred the bad to the good. They preferred to wear at their girdle bags filled with the foetid moxa, and considered it more fragrant than the most delicate orchids. He was inclined to take Ling-f\u0103n\u2019s advice, but hesitated and was perplexed in his mind. It might be in other places as he had found it in Ch\u2018\u00fc.\n\nXI. We come to the eleventh Section, in thirty-six lines. Before deciding what he would do, Ch\u2018\u00fc would take the advice of W\u00fb Hsien, a famous wizard or conjurer of old time, who, he had heard, was to come down to the world that same day in the evening. In order for an interview with him, he has the pepper and finest rice necessary for such an occasion made ready, and will constrain him to interpret the result of their divination.\nWu Hsien arrives in great state. Hundreds of spirits cast a shadow round him as he came down from above, and multitudes of others were sent by Shun from his grave on the hill of Nine Doubts to meet him; august Heaven also gloriously displayed its power. The object of all was to inform Ch\u00fc that the issue of Ling-fan's advice would be good.\n\nThen Wu Hsien delivered his oracle, and advised him to carry on his search, above and below, with vigour, and seek for those whose rules and measures agreed with his own, even as Yu and T'ang did till they found Kao Yao and Yi Yin. Loving his self-culture as he did, why should he call in the help of go-betweens? Let him think of the builder Fu Yueh whom Wu-ting made his counsellor and minister; and of Lu Wang, who was raised from his butcher's stall, and from his fishing, to be the great helper of kings Wan and Wu in establishing the dynasty of Chau; and of Ning Chi, who rose from being a waggoner to an honourable position in the service of the famous duke Hwan of Chi. Might not as great distinction be awaiting Ch\u00fc Yuan in the future? Wu Hsien therefore exhorts him, while it was still not too late in his life, to seek a reconciliation with king Hwai or to find another sovereign. Such was the oracle of Wu Hsien, the advice of a shrewd man of the world more than the utterances of a diviner. Our author was not cheered by it, however. He replied, deploring the confusion and degeneracy of the time. He was aware of the virtues of his own character, but his numerous and secret opponents strove to hide them. He was afraid that their hatred and jealousy would cause his ruin. Wherever he looked, he saw change to the worse going on. Those whom he had formerly compared in his\n\n1 The name Wu Hsien occurs in the Shu (V, xvi, 7) as a minister of the Chung Tsung T'ai-wu (B.C. 1637-1560). He may be the personage mentioned here, having been deified, or made a powerful sorcerer, after his death.\n2 See the case of Wu-ting and Fu Yueh in the Shu, IV, viii, and notes.\n3 See the account of him in Mayers' Manual, under the name of Kiang Taze-ya, p. 81.\n4 See also Mayers, art. 517. There is a graphic account of the meeting of duke Hwan and the waggoner, Ning Chi, in the Lieh-kwo Chih, Book xviii.\nmind to orchids and angelicas had lost their fragrance. Their beauty and attractiveness were gone; and he could not account for the change, but by the jealousy and opposition which his love of culture seemed to awaken in their minds.\n\nXII. We have arrived at the twelfth Section of the poem, contained in twenty lines. All through it, the author writes in his own person, and continues his complaint of the courtiers, whose characters had all changed for the worse. How could he ever have been so mistaken as to compare them to beautiful and fragrant orchids? They liked to fill the perfume bags at their girdles with the fruit of the sha, which, according to Bretschneider, is Boymia or Zanthoxylon. Another name for it is Ch\u00fb Y\u00fc (\u8331\u8438). Thus deploring the decay of character in the officers, descending to and vitiating still more the manners of the common people, he comes back to himself; he had been undervalued and misunderstood, but no change for the worse had come over him. He had lost nothing of character, ability, or will. His mind is made up. He will resume his travelling and search. Perhaps he may yet meet with the sovereign or the minister whom he wished to find.\n\nXIII. The poem is drawing to its close. Ling-fan had encouraged Ch\u2019\u00fc to try his fortune again and repeat his journeying; and this Section, in thirty-six lines, carries us to its concluding stanza, which the Marquis d\u2019Hervey calls \u201cthe epilogue of the poem.\u201d\n\nHaving chosen a fortunate day for his departure, he broke off a branch of the Ch\u2019iung tree\u00b9 for his food, and macerated or boiled it till it became the richest nourishment. These preparations having been made, an equipage and carriage, substantially the same as that in which he made his former journey, appears ready for him. The carriage\n\n\u00b9 This tree has been named before in stanza 56, section ix. See the account of it in Mayers\u2019 Manual, art. 317. The author here, in what he says about it, enters altogether into the region of mythological fable, or adopts the most fanciful fairy legends. I cannot agree with the Marquis d\u2019Hervey in making Ling-fan the subject of lines 2, 3, 4 of stanza 85. The subject of them is Ch\u2019\u00fc Yuan himself.\nis further adorned with figures made of the finest jade and ivory. He would go far away, and keep himself apart from Ch'\u00fc. How could he act in union with those who were estranged from him in heart?\n\nAgain he turned his course to K'w\u0103n-lun. The way was long, and he travelled far, amidst the dark and shady clouds, brightened with marvellous rainbows, and the music of the bells of jade about the chariot.\n\nHe had started in the morning from T'ien-tsin, which at first suggests to us the city of that name near the mouth of the Pei-ho river, and where our second treaty with China was concluded in 1858; but the name in the poem is that of a space in the Milky Way included in our Scorpio-Sagittarius. How Ch'\u00fc had arrived there with his equipage, and rested over the night also there, we do not know; but next day's driving, he tells us, brought him in the evening to the extreme west. At the back of the carriage, rose two flags, displaying a pair of ph\u0153nixes, one on each, which reverently greeted him as he reached his halting-place.\n\nHe did not rest there long. He tells us that \"immediately he walked over the Moving Sands, and then proceeded gaily along the course of the Red-river.\" The \"Moving Sands\" are mentioned in the Sh\u00fb (III, i, part i, 73 an pt. ii, 5, 23); meaning, no doubt, what we now call \"The desert of Gobi,\" or at least some portion of it. \"The Red-water\" is said in the K'ang-hsi dictionary to take its rise in the south-east corner of the wild in which the K'w\u0103n-lun begins. And Chwang-tsze (xv, p. 4) says that \"Hwang-T\u00ee, enjoying himself north of the Red-water, ascended to the heights of the K'w\u0103n-lun.\n\nWanting to cross over a ford of the Red-water, Ch'\u00fc Y\u00fcan motioned with his hand to his dragons to make themselves into a bridge, and at the same time summoned the Emperor of the West to wade with him across. Of a similar living bridge we have an instance, as is pointed out by both Wang Y\u00ee and Ch\u00fb, in the Record of the adventurous king M\u00fb, who caused his attendant gavials and turtles to render him such a service.\n\"The Emperor of the West\" is understood to be Shao Hao, the son and successor of Hwang-Ti in B.C. 2594, known also as Chin T'ien Shih (\u91d1\u5929\u6c0f), because he reigned \"by the virtue of metal,\" whatever that may mean. But metal among the elements is connected with the West, and therefore he is called, as here, \"The Sovereign of the West.\" But why is he brought in? And what could he, in the 26th century B.C., have to do with our author? And what had they to do with wading through the ford over which the dragons had made themselves a bridge?\n\nHaving crossed the Red-water our traveller continued his course to the west, going at the same time somewhat to the north. Of course, the way among the mountains was very difficult, and he made arrangements for their transit. \"Pu-ch'\u00fc\" was the name of a hill on the north-west, called \"Incomplete,\" in consequence of some peculiarity in its form. Ch'u would go by it as his own route, while the other carriages starting before him, should ascend wherever they could find a practicable bye-path, waiting for one another. When they all had got across, they should make for the shore of the Western Sea, and all assemble there. By the Western Sea was meant probably the Caspian Sea, or, perhaps, the sea of Aral. That we cannot more exactly identify it is of less importance, because there follows no intimation that the rendezvous took place.\n\nA stanza follows the account of these arrangements, in which we are told that the carriages were a thousand in number, to each of which eight dragons were yoked. The author does not say where he had collected such a cavalcade; we hear of it here for the first time and for the last. It would seem, however, that as he went on his excitement increased. He felt that he was drawing near the end of his quest, and he tells us,\n\n\"I repressed my emotion, and moderated my haste;\nBut my spirit was borne aloft very far.\"\n\n1 \u4e0d\u5468. The hill is mentioned by Hwai-nan Tsze, iv, p. 6a, and in the Shau Hai Ching, ii, p. 18a.\nI sang the nine songs (of Y\u00fc), and danced the dance (of Shun);\nBorrowing a day for enjoyment and pleasure.\"\n\nThe second book of Ch'\u00fc P'ing's poems has the title of \"The Nine Songs\"; but those could not be the songs which he chanted now. What is intended are the \"Nine Songs\" of Y\u00fc, mentioned in stanza 38; and the dance of Shun, often called his \"Music,\" was divided into nine pantomimic performances, and Chwang-tsze (Book xix, 44) calls it \"The Nine Performances of the Shao.\"\n\nWe have come to the end of our author's quest. He has told us that his spirit was borne aloft; and, unable to repress his excitement, he ascended to the glorious brightness of the great sky. How he accomplished the ascent we are not told. From amidst the supernal light, however, he looked down askance, and there beneath him lay outspread his old neighbourhood or home in Ch'\u00fc. The Hwang in l. 1 is interpreted as Hwang T'ien (\u7687\u5929), \"Great or August Heaven,\" for which Giles gives \"Almighty God\"; but I am loath to adopt that rendering.\n\nIn l. 3 there is to me an echo of the third Ode in the first Book of the Shih; and hence we understand how the poet transforms his \"dragons\" into horses, which have not been mentioned before in connection with his marvellous journeyings to the summit of the K'wan-lun range. The horses, however, partake of his emotion, and long for the cherished Ch'\u00fc.\n\n\u8737\u5c40 is a difficult phrase. Wang Yi explains it by \"the appearance of a snake stiff and motionless,\" and this definition of it is adopted in the Kang-hsi Dictionary. So would Ch'\u00fc Y\u00fcan tell us that he was arrested in his course, and his game lost and ended.\n\nXIV. The fourteenth and last Section of the poem, at which we have now arrived, consists of only one stanza, which contains five lines, being different from the ninety-three stanzas that precede, all of which are made up of four lines, with the single exception of the twelfth, which is manifestly defective.\nThe Marquis d\u2019Hervey prefixes to it the name \u201cEpilogue,\u201d as a translation of the first two characters (Lwan Y\u00fceh), and I was inclined to follow him; but the y\u00fceh seems to require that the stanza should be taken as the utterance of the poet himself. Lwan occurs in the Confucian Analects (xiii\u2013xv), as \u201cthe name of the concluding part of a musical service,\u201d and I believe the meaning of the phrase is fully expressed by \u201cIn conclusion I say,\u201d and making the first line to end with ts\u00e1i, the fifth character. It is singular that of our three chief Chinese-English dictionaries, Morrison\u2019s, Medhurst\u2019s, and Giles\u2019s, which may all be pronounced to be great Works, not one of them mentions this usage of lwan. The substance of the whole stanza is this,\u2014the fruitlessness of the discarded minister\u2019s search for a good sovereign who would adopt him as his counsellor, and for loyal ministers who would co-operate with him in his loyal service; and, failing this, his resolution to commit suicide as P\u2019\u0103ng Hsien had done. Twice before in the poem had he given expression to that purpose, and now he concludes with the more positive affirmation of it. At the same time there is nothing in his language to necessitate our supposing that the tragedy of his death followed immediately on the conclusion of the poem. Stanza sixty-five seems to indicate that king Hw\u00e2i was still alive when it was composed. In stanza seventy-six the sorcerer, W\u00fb Hsien, speaks of its not yet being too late in the years of Ch\u2019\u00fc\u2019s life for him to think of resuming his service at Court.\n\nThe writer has thus gone over the poem of the Li S\u00e1o, and endeavoured to set forth the connection of its parts and the unity of object which appears in it from beginning to end. It is not a great poem, but it possesses considerable interest, and awakens in the mind no small amount of sympathy with its author. We start with him in it at his birth; go back with him to the long distant time to which he traced his lineage; and only part with him when almost in sight of the deep pool in which he was to end his life. We admire his self-culture, his devoted\nservice, and his inflexible conviction of his own honesty and honour; we pity him as the object of jealousy and envy, slandered, disgraced, and banished. The view which we have taken of the ninth and longest Section of the composition, as symbolical of his own course and character, redeems it from being regarded as a mere tissue of absurdities and foolish superstitions. We rather like the man without admiring his poetry, and are sorry for his adverse fortune and melancholy fate.\nART. XVII.\u2014SSUMA CH'IEN'S HISTORICAL RECORDS. BY HERBERT J. ALLEN, M.R.A.S.\n\n(Continued from page 110, January number.)\n\nCHAPTER III. The Yin Dynasty.\n\nHsieh of Yin's mother was Chien Ti, who was one of the daughters of Yusung\u00b9 and the secondary wife of Emperor Ku. She was going with her two sisters to bathe, when she saw a dark bird\u00b2 drop its egg. Chien Ti picked it up, and swallowed it, and thus being with child gave birth to Hsieh. When Hsieh grew up, he was successful in assisting Y\u00fc to control the flood, and the Emperor Shun, directing Hsieh, said:\u00b3 \"The people are wanting in affection for one another, and do not observe the five orders of relationship. You, as Minister of Instruction, should reverently inculcate the lessons of duty belonging to those five orders, but do so with gentleness.\" He held in fief the principality of Shang, and was given the surname of Tz\u016d (son). Hsieh flourished in the reigns of Yao, Shun,\n\n\u00b9 The term Yusung is doubtless a variant of Yu-hsiung, one of the names of the 'Yellow Emperor' of the first chapter of the Records. The second of the two characters may also be read Jung, for it is the same as the ordinary one for 'Jung,' with the addition of the determinative 'woman' (\u5a66), as M. Lecouperie has already pointed out. Ssuma Ch'ien, in his history of the Hsiungnu (Huns), also calls the tribe Mountain Jung, so that if there were any truth in the history it might be shown that we have here a tradition of the descent of the Chinese nation from the Huns. The name Chien Ti means 'impetuous barbarian of the North.'\n\n\u00b2 The dark bird is a swallow. In the third sacrificial ode of Shang ('Sacred Books of the East,' iii., p. 307) we are told that 'Heaven commissioned the swallow to descend and give birth to the Shangs.'\n\n\u00b3 Quoting the passage from the Canon of Shun, also in the first chapter of the Records.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1895.\nand the great Y\u00fc.

T'ang at first dwelt in Po, choosing the residence of the first king, and the 'Emperor's Announcement' was written. When T'ang made an expedition against the princes, the chief of Ko was not offering the proper sacrifices, and T'ang began by punishing him.\" T'ang said: 'I observe that if a man looks at the water he sees his reflection; if he seeks to make an impression on the people, should he not know how to govern?' Iyin said: 'That is clear! If you say that you will listen to reason you may offer yourself as ruler of the State. Whether the people do right or not depends entirely on the king and his ministers. Rouse yourself to action!' T'ang said: 'If you cannot respect my commands, I will inflict upon you the extreme penalty of death. You will not obtain forgiveness.'\u00b9 \"The punitive expedition of T'ang was written.\" Iyin's name was Ah\u00eang.\n\n\u00b9 From the preface to the Shuching, paras. 9 and 10.\nAh\u00eang wanted to meet T'ang, but had no opportunity of doing so; he therefore became cook to the prince of Hsin, and while bringing T'ang dishes to taste urged him to perfect himself in the way of the ancient kings. Some say that when Iyin was living in retirement T'ang sent five times to invite him to a meeting before he would obey him, and talk about matters connected with the guileless king and the nine rulers. T'ang promoted Jen to the administration of affairs. \"Iyin went from T'ang to Hsia. Being indignant with the sovereign of Hsia, he returned to Po, and as he entered by the north gate met Juchiu and Jufang, and the 'Juchiu' and 'Jufang' were written.\" T'ang went out and saw a rustic, who was spreading nets in every direction, and vowing that every bird in the sky should go into his net. T'ang said, 'What! all?' Then, taking away the nets on three sides, he vowed that those which wanted to go to the left should go left, and those which wanted to go right should go right, and that only those which were the victims of fate should be caught in the net. The princes, hearing of it, said, 'T'ang's kindness is extreme, and extends even to birds and beasts.' At this time Chieh of Hsia was oppressive, and his rule dissipated, and one of the princes K'unwu rebelled, so T'ang, levying an army, put himself at the head of the princes. Iyin followed T'ang, who, grasping a halberd, marched against K'unwu, and then attacked Chieh. \"T'ang said: Come, ye multitudes of the people, listen ye all to my words. It is not I, the little child, who dare to raise a rebellion. The\n\n1 Iyin is stated to have come to Po in the train of a daughter of the prince of Hsin, whom T'ang was marrying, and recommended himself to the favour of the latter by his knowledge of cookery (L. C. II, p. 238).\n2 A native commentator says that the guileless king was T'ai-su-shang-huang (great guileless supreme sovereign). The nine rulers are stated by one author to be the 'three sovereigns,' the 'five gods,' and Yu, the founder of the Hsia dynasty, while another says they are the 'nine sovereigns of man' (vide Introductory Chapter to the Historical Records).\n3 Quotation from the preface to the Shuching, para. 11.\n4 Cf. the name K'unmo, king of the Wusun country, to which a princess of China was sent B.C. 105.\n5 The whole of the 'Speech of T'ang,' being the first of the 'Books of Shang,' is here quoted.\nruler of Hsia has committed many crimes. I have indeed heard the words of you all, but the Hsia ruler is an offender, and, as I fear the Supreme god, I dare not but punish him. Now, as the Hsia ruler has committed many crimes, Heaven has charged me to destroy him. Now, ye multitudes, you are saying, 'Our sovereign does not compassionate us; he disregards our husbandry, and his government is a cruel one.' You say, 'As to his crimes, what remedy have we?' The king of Hsia does nothing but exhaust his people's strength, and treat the kingdom of Hsia oppressively. His people have all become idle, and are not in harmony with him, saying, 'When will this sun set? We shall all perish together.' Such being the conduct of the sovereign of Hsia, I must advance. Do you help me, the one man, to carry out the punishment decreed by Heaven, and I will greatly reward you. On no account disbelieve me. I will not retract my words. If you do not carry out the words of my speech, I will put you and your children to death; you shall not be pardoned.\" This being announced to the army, \"the speech of T'ang was written.\" 1 T'ang then said, 'I am very warlike'; and he was styled the 'warlike king.' 2 Chieh was defeated in the wilds of Yusung, and fled to Mingt'iao. 3 \"The army of Hsia being entirely defeated, T'ang smote Santsung, where he captured the precious jewels. Ipo and Ch'ungpo wrote the 'Statutes and Jewels.' When T'ang had conquered Hsia, he wished to remove the altars to the spirits of the land, but was unable to do so, and the 'Altar of Hsia' was written.\" Iyin made a report, and the princes being satisfied, T'ang ascended the Imperial throne, and tranquillized the country within the four seas. 4 \"When T'ang returned he came\n\n1 Preface to the Shuching, para. 12.\n2 It is noticeable that the term 'warlike king' was applied to the founders of both the Shang and Chou dynasties, as well as to the emperor under whose sway the historian wrote.\n3 Quotation from the 14th and 13th paragraphs of the preface to the Shuching.\n4 Quotation from the preface to the Shuching, paras. 15 and 16. The 'Announcement of Chunghui' is the second book of Shang, and the 'Announcement of T'ang' the third book of Shang.\nto T'aich\u00fcant'ao, and Chunghui wrote his announcement. Having made an end of the sovereignty of Hsia, T'ang returned to Po and wrote the 'Announcement of T'ang.'\n\nIn the third month the king came himself to the eastern suburb and made the following announcement to the princes and nobles: 'If you do not perform meritorious service for the people and be diligent in your business, I shall inflict the extreme punishment of death. Do not murmur against me.' He also said: 'Formerly Y\u00fc and Kaoyao laboured long in distant regions. They performed meritorious service for the people, who dwelt in peace. On the east there was the Great river, on the north the Chi, on the west the Yellow river, and on the south the Huai. These four streams were kept within bounds, and the people dwelt in safety. Prince Millet told them how to sow and cultivate the various kinds of grain. These three chiefs all performed meritorious service for the people, and were therefore ennobled. Formerly Ch'ihyu and his officers raised a rebellion among the people, but the [Yellow] Emperor disapproved, and his crimes were exposed. The words of the former kings cannot but rouse you to action. If you are unprincipled you shall not rule in the State. Do not murmur against me.' Thus he directed the princes.\n\n1 \"Iyin wrote the book 'Both possessed pure Virtue,' and Chiutan wrote the 'Illustrious Abode.'\"\n\nT'ang altered the day of the New Year, and changed the colour of the dresses, white being uniformly worn at State functions.\n\n2 \"After the demise of T'ang\" his eldest son,\n\n---\n\n1 Quotation from the preface to the Shuching, paras. 20 and 17. The 'Both possessed pure Virtue' is the sixth book of Shang.\n\n2 Quotation from Mencius (L. C. II, p. 236). Dr. Legge having noticed the historical difficulty as to T'ang's successor, and intimated that he should follow the standard chronology, which omits the reigns of Waiping and Chung-j\u00ean, it would be as well to give the reading of Mencius, which, although rather vague, seems to confirm the historian's statement. Mencius says: \"After T'ang's demise, T'ai'ting did not come to the throne. Waiping two years; Chung-j\u00ean four years; T'aichia turned upside down the statutes of T'ang, and Iyin placed him in T'ang,\" etc. Dr. Legge considers that the language of the 18th paragraph of the preface to the Shuching, viz., \"After the death of T'ang, in the first year of T'aichia,\" is opposed to the view that there were two reigns between T'ang and T'aichia.\n\"T'aiting (Great D), died before he could come to the throne\"; and so T'aiting's younger brother Waiping (Outer C), that is Emperor Waiping, came to the throne.\n\nEmperor \"Waiping\" reigned \"three years,\" and died, and his brother Chungj\u00ean (Middle I), that is Emperor Chungj\u00ean, came to the throne.\n\nEmperor \"Chungj\u00ean\" reigned \"four years,\" and died. Iyin then set T'aiting's son, T'aichia (Great A), on the throne. He was T'ang the Completer's eldest legitimate grandson. This was Emperor T'aichia. \u00b9\"In the first year of Emperor T'aichia, Iyin wrote the 'Instructions of I,' the 'Declaration of the Appointment of Heaven,' and the 'Deceased Sovereign.' After Emperor T'aichia had been on the throne\" three years, \"he proved unintelligent\" and cruel. He did not obey T'ang's laws, and his conduct was disorderly, so \u00b9\"Iyin placed him in the Dryandra\" (palace). For three years Iyin administered the government, and as ruler of the State gave audience to the nobles. After the Emperor T'aichia had dwelt in the Dryandra palace \u00b2\"for three years, he repented of his errors, blamed himself, and amended his ways.\" Whereupon Iyin met the Emperor T'aichia and resigned to him the reins of government. Emperor T'aichia became virtuous, the princes all returned to the Yin capital, and the people were tranquil. Iyin praised him, and \u00b9\"wrote the 'Instructions to T'aichia' in three books.\" Commending Emperor T'aichia, he honoured him with the title of 'Great Master.'\n\n'Great Master' died, and his son Wuting (Glossy D) came to the throne. In Emperor Wuting's reign, Iyin died. \u00b3\"When they had buried Iyin at Po, Chiu Tan set forth as lessons the doings of Iyin; and the 'Wuting' was written.\"\n\nWuting died, and his brother T'aik\u00eang (Great G), that is Emperor T'aik\u00eang, came to the throne.\n\n\u00b9 Quotations from the preface to the Shuching, paras. 18 and 19.

In his reign \u00b9\u201cIchih became prime minister, when there were omens in Po, for a mulberry tree and a stalk of grain grew up together in the court.\u201d They attained full size in one evening, and Emperor T'aimou, being alarmed, questioned Ichih on the subject. Ichih said: \u2018I, your servant, have heard that virtue is not overcome by evil omens. There may be defects in your Majesty\u2019s government, but let your Majesty cultivate virtue.\u2019 T'aimou followed his advice, and the ominous mulberry withered away. \u00b9\u201cIchih consulted with Hsien the wizard,\u201d who governed the king\u2019s household admirably, \u00b9\u201cand wrote the \u2018Hsien-ai\u2019\u201d and the \u2018T'aimou.\u2019 Emperor \u00b2\u201cT'aimou spoke on the subject with Ichih\u201d in court, and said he was disloyal. Ichih gave up his post, and \u00b2\u201cwrote the original commands.\u201d Yin prospered again, and the princes gave their allegiance to the Emperor, who was called Middle Master.\n\nMiddle Master died, and his son Emperor Chungting (Middle D) came to the throne.

In Emperor Tsuyi's time Yin again prospered, and the wizard Hsien held office.\n\nTsuyi died, and his son Emperor Tsuhsin (Ancestor H) came to the throne.\n\nEmperor Tsuhsin died, and his brother Wuchia (Glossy A), i.e. Emperor Wuchia, came to the throne.\n\nEmperor Wuchia died, and Tsuting (Ancestor D), that is Emperor Tsuting, who was Wuchia's elder brother, was put on the throne.\n\nEmperor Tsuting died, and his brother Wuchia's son, Nank\u00eang (South G), that is Emperor Nank\u00eang, was put on the throne.\n\nEmperor Nank\u00eang died, and Emperor Tsuting's son Yangchia (Male A), that is Emperor Yangchia, was put on the throne. In his reign the power of the Yins declined. Ever since the reign of Chungting the legitimate heir had been set aside, and junior scions put on the throne instead. These used to fight and displace each other. For the last nine generations there had been anarchy, and the princes neglected to come to court.\n\nEmperor Yangchia died, and his brother Pank\u00eang (Plate G), that is Emperor Pank\u00eang, came to the throne. In his reign the Yins had their capital on the north of the Yellow river, but Pank\u00eang crossed to the south of the river, and reoccupied the old palace of T'ang the Completer. This \"made the fifth change of capital,\" and, as they had no fixed place of abode, \"the people of Yin murmured and repined,\" for they did not like moving about. Pank\u00eang made the following announcement to the princes and ministers: 'Formerly our exalted sovereign T'ang the Completer, in conjunction with your ancestors, decided what laws and regulations of the empire should be attended to or set aside, but if you do not make an effort how can\n\n1 From para. 27 of preface to the Shuching. The Pank\u00eang is the seventh book of Shang.\nyou attain perfection?' He then crossed over to the south of the river, set up his capital at Po, and having adopted T'ang's system of government, the people were thereby tranquillized, and the fortunes of Yin were again in the ascendant. The princes came to court, and were influenced by the virtues of T'ang the Completer.\n\nEmperor Pank\u00eang died, and his brother Hsiaohsin (Little H), that is Emperor Hsiaohsin, came to the throne. In his reign the power of Yin was again on the wane. The people remembered Pank\u00eang, and \"the 'Pank\u00eang' in three parts was written.\"\n\nEmperor Hsiaohsin died, and his brother Hsiaoyi (Little B), that is Emperor Hsiaoyi, came to the throne.\n\nEmperor Hsiaoyi died, and his son Emperor Wuting (Martial D) came to the throne. When Emperor Wuting was on the throne, he pondered how the Yin dynasty could be revivified, but as he had not obtained an assistant he \"did not speak\" for three years, government affairs having to be conducted by the prime minister, who examined into the customs of the country. Wuting \"dreamed\" one night \"that he had found a holy man named Yue,\" and, in order that he might secure the man he had seen in his dream, he passed under review his officers and ministers of State, but not one of them was the right man. He then \"made all his officers search for him in the wilds, and Yue was discovered at the crag of Fu.\" At this time Yue was a clerk, not \"a builder at the crag of Fu.\" He had an audience of Wuting, who said, 'That is the right man.' Having talked with him, and finding that he really was a holy man, Wuting \"promoted him to be his prime minister.\"\n\n1 Para. 27 of preface to the Shuching.\n2 This passage becomes more intelligible on referring to the 'Charge to Yue,' or the eighth book of Shang, a portion of which is quoted (L. C. III, pt. i, p. 250), where the king says: \"As it is mine to secure what is right in the four quarters of the empire, I have been afraid that my virtue is not equal to that of my predecessors, and, therefore, have not spoken. But while I was respectfully and silently thinking of the right way, I dreamt that God gave me a good assistant, who should speak for me. He then minutely described the appearance of the person, and caused search to be made for him, by means of an image of him, throughout the empire. Yue, a builder in the country of Fuyen, was found like,\" etc.\n3 Para. 28 of preface to the Shuching.\nkingdom of Yin was well governed in consequence, and he was named after the crag of Fu, being called Fu Yue. \"Wuting was sacrificing to T'ang the Completer\" the next day, \"when a pheasant flew up, lighted on the ear of a tripod, and crowed.\" Wuting was alarmed, but \"Tsuchi (Ancestor F) said\" the king should not be anxious; he must first rectify the administration of affairs. \"Tsuchi accordingly lectured the king, saying, 'In its superintendence over men below, Heaven pays special regard to their proper behaviour, and bestows on them accordingly length of years or the reverse. Heaven does not cut short men's lives; they bring them to an end themselves. Some men may not have conformed to virtue, and will not acknowledge their crimes; Heaven then charges them to correct their conduct, but they say, 'What shall we do?' Ah! the king should continuously treat the people with respect. Are they not Heaven's descendants? Be constant in sacrificing, and do not worship with the rites of a discarded religion.'\" Wuting instituted a government reform, and practised virtue. The whole nation rejoiced, and the fortunes of Yin again flourished.\n\nEmperor Wuting died, and his son Emperor Tsuk\u00eang (Ancestor G) came to the throne. Tsuchi commended Wuting for considering the omen of the pheasant as a ground for practising virtue, and conferred on him the posthumous title of 'exalted ancestor,' and \"the 'Day of the Supplementary Sacrifice of Kaotsung' and the 'Instructions [to Kaotsung]' were written.\"\n\nEmperor Tsuk\u00eang died, and his brother Teuchia (Ancestor A), that is Emperor Chia, came to the throne. He was dissipated, and the fortunes of Yin again waned.\n\nEmperor Chia died, and his son Emperor Linhsin (Granary H) sat on the throne.\n\nEmperor Linhsin died, and his brother K\u00eangting (G. D), that is Emperor K\u00eangting, sat on the throne.\n\n1 From para. 29 of preface to the Shuching.\n2 Here follows the whole of the book called 'The Day of the Supplementary Sacrifice of Kaotsung,' that being the ninth book of Shang.\n3 From para. 29 of preface to the Shuching.\nEmperor K\u00eangting died, and his son Emperor Wuyi (Martial B) sat on the throne. The Yins again left Po, and crossed to the north bank of the river. The Emperor Wuyi was unprincipled and made images, which he called 'Heavenly gods.' With these he played chess, ordering some one to make the moves for them; and when the 'celestial gods' did not win he abused them, and making a leather bag, filled it with blood, threw it up and shot at it. This he called shooting at Heaven. While Wuyi was hunting between the Yellow and Wei rivers, there was a clap of thunder, and Wuyi was struck dead by lightning.\n\nHis son Emperor T'aiting (Great D) came to the throne.\n\nEmperor T'aiting died, and his son Emperor Yi (B) sat on the throne. In his reign the fortunes of Yin declined still further. Emperor Yi's (B) eldest son was Ch'i, viscount of Wei. Ch'i's mother being of low caste, he could not be heir to the throne. His younger son was Hsin (H), whose mother was the principal consort, and so he became the heir-apparent.\n\nEmperor Yi died, and his son Hsin sat on the throne. Emperor Hsin was called by everybody in the empire Chou (the tyrant). Emperor Chou's discrimination was acute, his hearing and sight particularly good, his natural abilities extraordinary, and his physical strength equal to that of a wild beast. He had cunning enough to evade reproofs, and volubility enough to gloss over his faults. He boasted that he was above his ministers on the ground of ability, and that he surpassed the people of the empire on account of his reputation. He indulged in wine, women, and lusts of all sorts. His partiality for Tachi (Actress F) caused him to carry out whatever she desired, so that his ministers had to devise new forms of dissipation, the most depraved dances and extravagant music; he increased the taxation in order to fill the Stag tower with money, and to store the granary at 'Big bridge.' He made a collection of dogs, horses, and curiosities, with which he filled his palaces; and enlarging his parks and towers at Shach'iu,\nprocured numbers of wild beasts and birds and put them therein. He slighted the spirits, assembled a great number of play actors at Shach'iu, made a pond of wine, hung the trees with meat, made men and women chase each other about quite naked, and had drinking bouts the whole night long. The people murmured, and when the nobles rebelled Chouhsin increased the severity of his punishments, instituting the punishment of roasting.\\footnote{This was a copper rod placed over a pan of live charcoal, and rubbed with grease, and arranged in such a way that when the poor wretches had to cross over it, they slipped and fell into the fire.} He appointed Ch'ang Chief of the West, the prince of Chiu, and the prince of Ou his three principal ministers. The prince of Chiu had a beloved daughter who was sent in to the emperor, and when she disapproved of his debaucheries the tyrant killed her in his rage, and made mincemeat of her father. The prince of Ou objected, and vehemently remonstrated with him, whereupon he was sliced to pieces. Ch'ang Chief of the West, hearing of all this, sighed furtively, but 'Tiger' the prince of Ts'ung, being aware of it, informed the tyrant, who thereupon cast Chief of the West into prison at Yuli. His servant Hungyao and others procured a pretty girl, rare curiosities, and fine horses, which they presented to the tyrant, who thereupon pardoned Chief of the West. The latter went forth and gave the country to the west of the Lo river to the tyrant, and begged that he would abolish the punishment of roasting. The emperor agreed to this, and gave him bows, arrows, axes, and halberds, with a commission to start on a warlike expedition. He was appointed Chief of the West, and Feich'ung was employed in the government. Feich'ung was fond of flattery and greedy of gain, so the men of Yin were not attached to him. The tyrant also gave Alai an appointment, but Alai was fond of vilifying persons, so the princes became more and more estranged from the court. Now Chief of the West, on returning from his expedition, secretly cultivated virtue, and was charitable; many of the princes revolted from\nthe tyrant and gave their allegiance to Chief of the West, who from this time gained in influence, while the tyrant rather lost his authority. The monarch's son Pikan remonstrated with his father, but he was not listened to. Shangyung praised his worth, and the people loved him, but the tyrant set him aside. Chief of the West marched against and conquered the Chi State, and the tyrant's minister \"Tsu-i\" heard of it, and \"blaming [the house of] Chou hurried off in alarm to report it to the tyrant.\" \"He said: 'Heaven is bringing to an end the destiny of our dynasty of Yin; great men and the ancient tortoise do not venture to foretell good fortune. It is not that the former kings do not aid us men of this later time; but you, O king, by your dissoluteness and oppression are cutting yourself off. Heaven has therefore rejected us; we do not eat our meals in peace, we do not consider our heavenly nature, we do not follow and observe the statutes. Our people are now all longing for the destruction of the dynasty, saying, Why does not Heaven send down its awe-inspiring authority? Why is not its great decree manifested? What remedy is there against the present king?' The tyrant said: 'Is not my life secured by the decree of Heaven?' Tsu-i returned, and said,\" 'The tyrant cannot be remonstrated with.' Chief of the West having died, King Wu of Chou in his march eastward arrived at the ford of M\u00eang. The princes revolted, and 800 princes of the house of Chou having assembled declared that the tyrant ought to be attacked. King Wu said, 'You know nothing of Heaven's decree,' and retired. The tyrant abandoned himself all the more to lust and dissipation, and the viscount of Wei remonstrated with him several times, but he would not heed, so having consulted with the senior and junior tutors the viscount\n\n1 From 30th paragraph of preface to the Shuching.\n2 The tenth book of Shang, called 'The Chief of the West's Conquest of Li,' is here quoted throughout, with the exception of the last sentence.\n3 The eleventh or last book of Shang is referred to. Every book in the first part of the Shuching has now been quoted from or referred to.\nof Wei withdrew from court. Pikan said, 'A minister cannot but argue to the death'; he accordingly remonstrated vehemently with the tyrant, who in a rage said, 'I have heard that the heart of a holy man has seven apertures,' and cut Pikan open to look at his heart. The viscount of Chi, in terror, then feigned himself mad, and became a slave,\" and the tyrant again imprisoned him. The senior and junior tutors of Yin, accordingly, taking the sacrificial and musical implements, hastened to the Chou State, and King Wu of Chou upon this marched at the head of the princes to attack the tyrant, who also sent out an army to withstand him in the plain of Mu. On the day Chia-tz\u00fc the tyrant's troops were beaten, and he himself fled to the Stag tower, which he ascended, and, putting on his gorgeous robes and jewels, burnt himself to death. King Wu of Chou then cut off the tyrant's head and exhibited it on a pole; he also slew Tachi, released the viscount of Chi from prison, raised a tumulus over the grave of Pikan, and made a eulogy to the memory of Shangyung.\" His sons, Wuk\u00eang and L\u00fbfu, were appointed to continue the sacrifices to the Yins. He restored Pank\u00eang's mode of administration, and the people of Yin were greatly rejoiced. Whereupon King Wu of Chou became Son of Heaven (emperor). His descendants abolished the title of Ti (divine emperor), and called themselves kings (Wang); and the descendants of the Yins were made princes subordinate to the house of Chou.\n\nAfter the death of King Wu of Chou, Wuk\u00eang, Kuanshu, and Ts'aishu rebelled. King Ch'\u00eang ordered the duke of Chou to execute them, and the viscount of Wei was established in the Sung State to continue (the ancestral worship as) a descendant of the Yins.\n\n1 This expression is found in the Analects, 18, i.\n2 Quotation from the third book of Chou, called 'Successful Completion of the War.'\n3 As the period recorded in this chapter extends from B.C. 2256 to 1122, according to the accepted chronology, it must be admitted that the details are meagre in the extreme. Of the forty-three reigns, including the thirteen prior to T'ang the Completer, we have merely a list of names of the rulers (and this is also the case with eleven out of the seventeen emperors of the Hsia dynasty),\nand the chapter is chiefly made up of ridiculous legends and pompous announcements. Again, every one of the thirty emperors of this dynasty has a name compounded of one of the '10 stems'\u2014used for the cycle and for numeration, and which I have, therefore, translated by a letter of the alphabet\u2014and a word such as 'ancestor,' 'great,' 'little,' 'martial,' etc. It has been alleged that the real names of these emperors have been tabooed, but those who assert this should be prepared to state where we are to look for the real names, for the histories do not give any others than those I have mentioned, and should give their authority for the statement that the names were actually tabooed. Cyclical characters also form part of the names of five of T'ang the Completer's immediate ancestors, of Wu-ting's minister, and of the vile consort of the last sovereign of the Yin dynasty. If it were the custom to taboo the names of the emperors of the dynasty (and history does not relate that such was the case), why should the names of these people also be tabooed? It is hard to reconcile so many strange coincidences with actual facts. Surely it is more natural to suppose that the historian, who had reformed the calendar just before he wrote his history, and whose mind was, therefore, running on cyclical characters, should have used them as names for his fictitious emperors.\n\n(To be continued.)\nART. XVIII.\u2014Some Buddhist Bronzes, and Relics of Buddha.\n\nBy Robert Sewell, M.R.A.S.\n\n[The portion of this Paper relating to the bronzes has been prepared at the request of the Secretary of State for India.\u2014R. S.]\n\nThe Buddhap\u0101d Bronzes.\n\nThe bronze images and fragments figured in the accompanying plates are a few specimens taken from a large collection now lying at Bezwada, all of which were found, some time before the year 1870, by some labourers employed under the Public Works Department of the Madras Presidency while excavating a canal at a place called Buddhap\u0101d, or Buddhav\u0101ni, about 20 miles westwards from the right bank of the river K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101, and 30 miles from the nearest mouth of its delta.\n\nIn 1870 the late Mr. J. Boswell, then Collector of the District, who took a deep interest in antiquarian work, sent in to the Madras Government an interesting and valuable report on the remains to be found on the river K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101, which was afterwards published in extenso in the first volume of the Indian Antiquary. In describing the remains at Bezwada (or Bejv\u0101\u1e0d\u0101), now a flourishing railway centre on the north bank 50 miles from the sea, he wrote as follows: \"There are... a number of copper Buddhist images in the Library at Bejwada. These were found buried at Buddhav\u0101ni in the Repalle Taluqa, a place which retains traces of its origin in its name.... There are a number of... images of the Buddhist saints, varying in size from one to two feet in height. They are beautifully executed.... Each figure formerly stood on a pedestal of its own, but I am informed that, as these pedestals bore...\"\ncertain characters, probably the names of the saints, they were sent to Madras to be deciphered. They have, however, never been returned. I presume they are in the Government Central Museum. I would recommend bringing the figures and their pedestals together again...\"\n\nThese pedestals have entirely disappeared with the exception of one (Pl. V, figs. 2a, 2b) which was found by myself under the circumstances shortly to be related. Enquiries have, I believe, since been made by the officers in charge of the Government Central Museum at Madras though without success, but as that building contains extensive basements it would appear even now possible that they might be discovered. Such a discovery would be of interest, since it would finally settle the date of these bronze images and fragments; and this settlement might prove of historical value if, as I suppose, the images belong to a comparatively late date in Indian Buddhism. The inscribed base found by myself is apparently not Buddhist but later Jain, and it would seem to have belonged to an image different from those now under consideration.\n\nThe images noted by Mr. Boswell consisted of entire figures, and I saw none but these when first stationed at Bezwada early in 1875. One day, however (I cannot exactly remember the date but it was probably in that year), I was informed that in the workshops of the Public Works Department at that place there were a number of broken pieces of bronze lying about, and on sending for and obtaining some, through the kindness of the officer in charge, I found that they consisted of specimens similar to those already at the little museum or library. This led to a search being made and in the end I succeeded in rescuing several baskets full of images, heads, arms, feet, dagobas, bases, and other fragments, mostly belonging to the Buddhist period, all of which had for some years lain condemned as old and useless metal. It was said that they had formed part of the Buddhap\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dita find, and they were placed by me in the library along with the others. In 1879 I brought to England the pieces forming the present\ncollection\u2014a small fraction of those which I had rescued\u2014and they remained on exhibition in the Indian Institute at Oxford till handed over to the India Office at Dr. Burgess's instance about the year 1882.\n\nOf the statuettes and fragments now figured, Plate I, No. 1 represents Buddha in the Varamudra position, giving, or bestowing, or granting a boon. This is represented by the open right hand. The left hand holds between the thumb and forefinger some object not easily recognizable as it is completely broken off, but it may well be a sprig of foliage, as shown in the Sop\u0101ra image of Maitreya Bodhisattva (Jour. Bomb. Br. R. A. S., vol. xv, pl. v, p. 298, Dr. Bhagvanl\u0101l Indraji's paper), where also the position of the right hand is similar. The head of the Buddha is as usual bare, the hair twisted in crisp curls and always bending to the right; the ears are very long, the lobes being artificially elongated according to the universal fashion of the time. This was accomplished by the insertion of plugs or rings, ever increasing in size as the years went on, into holes bored through the centre of the lobes. The fashion is portrayed in all the ancient sculptures, and is abundantly seen on the Amar\u0101vati marbles.\n\nThe Buddha is shewn with his long yellow robe clinging tightly to the figure, hanging down to the ankle, and with the long loose end caught up from the outside of the left forearm;\u2014the Roman toga was similarly worn. It is tightly fastened round the waist. The right breast is as usual bare, the cloth passing over the left shoulder.\n\nPl. I, No. 2 is the largest of the three full figures. The same description applies to it. In this case the feet are missing, as also is the left hand. The right is in the Varamudra position, as with the first. Behind the figure at the height of the shoulder is a small projection and ring intended evidently to hold the decorated nimbus, which, as with our own pictured saints, is constantly found in representations of Buddha.\n\nPl. I, No. 3 is very perfect. It has, as have most of the apparently more modern images, a peculiar bunch of\nhair on the top of the head, a feature somewhat difficult to understand since it does not appear that Buddha's hair was allowed to grow long, or was worn knotted or twisted on the top of the head. All genuine images of Buddha have short curly hair of a negroid type, and even on the knot here seen the same short twists are observed. I notice that the statue of Buddha figured by Mr. Rea in his last volume (of which I myself made a careful drawing in 1875) has not got this peculiar knot on the top of the head. The right hand in this case is in the Abhayamudra, or blessing position, upheld and with the fingers raised. The left hand of this image is slightly bent, with the fingers closed.\n\nPl. II, Nos. 1 and 2 are two separate heads. It is always difficult to say whether each is meant to represent Buddha himself or one of the saints, but the bare head is certainly characteristic of the former. It will be noticed that in No. 1 the artist has pierced holes to give a more lifelike appearance to the pupils of the eyes.\n\nPl. II, No. 3. The small head and shoulders is, I think, part of a seated figure. The head rests against some object which may be assumed to be the usual seven-headed cobra, and if so this certainly means that the Buddha was sitting on its coils, probably in the attitude of meditation, with the hands resting on the folded lower limbs.\n\nPl. II, No. 4 shews us how some, at least, of these bronze statuettes were made to stand erect. There was a lotus-base below the feet through the top of which passed two pins under the two feet of the figure, the pins being fastened probably by nuts screwed on to them on the lower side of the hollow base. The size of the feet in this case also conveys an idea as to the relative size of the figure for which this base was intended. It will be seen that the figure in question was larger than any of our three, and according to the proportion of size of feet to height of statue in the two we possess the figure should have been 20 inches high. The base has three rings on the outside of the lower rim, which were probably intended\nto receive hooks for fastening the image securely in its place.\n\nPl. III, No. 5 is a Buddhist dagoba. The material is thin, and it was apparently never filled up on the inside, but stood as we see it, a hollow shell. The base, the procession path, the dome, and the tee are shewn as in all similar figures, but degenerated so that the whole is a mere symbolic ornament. Older specimens would show the base with vertical sides, and the procession path with a level flooring. The dome, again, does not rest square on its base, but the sides curve inwards to meet it.\n\nPl. IV, Nos. 2 and 2a are the back and front of a small image of the Buddha seated, with his hands folded, in the Dhy\u0101namudr\u0101 or meditating attitude. It is also called the Padm\u0101sana, or lotus-seated attitude. The bronze shell has been filled with a black substance, but the head rested on a small bronze column running vertically up the centre. At the back of the figure (No. 2) is seen the tail of the n\u0101ga\u2014generally a seven-headed cobra\u2014whose hoods canopy the seated image. It will be noticed that this figure is only a half-length\u2014from head to waist. The legs, even, are not represented as folded, and yet the attitude cannot be mistaken.\n\nPl. V, No. 1 was till recently so coated and encrusted with dirt that I mistook it for a modern image, since its shape is precisely that of the innumerable cheap shrines so commonly made by modern workers in brass and copper. But since its cleaning it is plain that we have to deal with a purely Buddhist, though apparently very modern Buddhist, figure. The face is heavy, coarse, and rough, and all the peculiarities are exaggerated. The image is seated in the Dhy\u0101namudr\u0101 attitude, surrounded by a number of attendant g\u0101nas, on a makara tora\u1e47a, or fish-monster canopy; above its head is a nimbus and triple chattra, or umbrella of sovereignty. The g\u0101na is strongly in evidence in all Buddhist sculptures. He is a supernatural being, dwarf-like, often grotesque, often positively humorous, always in attendance on and worshipping the principal figure.\nThis image is so much injured at the base that the figures below the Buddha's throne cannot be deciphered. They take the place occupied in all similar Brahmanical shrines by the deity's vahana, or vehicle. Thus, \u015aiva has his bull, Vish\u1e47u the garu\u1e0da, Gane\u015ba the rat, and so on. It would be interesting to know what the design on this base was intended to represent\u2014possibly two crouching g\u0101nas.\n\nPl. IV, No. 1 is the gem of the collection. It has been figured in three positions (1, 1a, 1b) so as to convey some idea to the reader of the artistic beauty of the original. It is hardly too much to say that the modelling of this little right hand is almost perfect, and for grace and delicacy can hardly be surpassed. One fault and one only can be found with it. It may be thought too feminine in character for a man's hand according to European ideas, but it should not be forgotten that the high-class clerkly Brahman or priest is not a man of action. Seldom taking exercise,\u00b9 never playing manly games, occupied solely with pursuits that from youth upwards make no call on the muscles, the priestly or Brahmanical class, especially those of higher rank in life or possessed of more worldly wealth than others, do, as a fact, retain a luxurious softness and flexibility of hand and forearm during their whole lives that a European would characterize as emasculate\u2014unmanly; and therefore to the mind of the artist who framed the statue of which this exquisite hand is a small fragment there may have presented itself the desire so to model the hand of the Buddha as to recall his princely youth, the luxury of his palace life, the thoughtful bent of his mind, rather than the austerity and rigour of his isolation in the forests, or the hardness of the life which must in later years have braced and strengthened the fabric of his body, and toughened and disfigured the original elegance of hand and arm.\n\n\u00b9 These remarks will in a few years be considered obsolete, since the love of manly exercises appears to be growing amongst the youth of India.\u2014R. S.\nThe right arm in this figure was slightly bent across the body so as to meet the left hand in front of the chest. The forearm was almost at right angles to the upper arm. The position is that of teaching or discoursing, where the fingers mark the sequence of argument. It is called in Sanskrit literature the Dharmachakra attitude.\n\nI have referred above to Dr. Bhagvanlal Indrajii's paper on \"Antiquarian Remains at Sopara and Padana.\" The position alluded to is seen there in the attitude of Vipa\u015by\u012b (plate xii, Jour. Bomb. Br. R. A. S., xv, p. 300), and in the drawings from the Ajanta Cave (id. plates xvii and xviii, Nos. 2 and 8).\n\nPl. III, No. 1 gives us the whole of a right arm; and the connection with the body whence the fragment was broken off shows that the arm was held dropped to three-quarter length and not held stiffly at full length, so that the forearm was slightly advanced. In the hand is lightly held some object, probably the branch or sprig of a tree or creeper, the thumb and forefinger meeting on the stalk and the rest of it, touched by the finger-tips, passing over the palm to the little finger, where it has been broken off.\n\nPl. III, No. 2 is a small right hand, advanced so as to be at right angles to the upper arm, or horizontal from the elbow. It is in the Abhayamudr\u0101, or blessing attitude, and may be compared with No. 4 in pls. xvii and xviii in the paper referred to above on a figure from the Ajanta Cave.\n\nPl. III, Nos. 3 and 4 are fragments, a forearm and a foot.\n\nThe last is the inscribed fragment (Pl. V, Nos. 2a, 2b, 2c) which apparently formed part of the base of a figure. This was submitted to Dr. B\u00fchler and he has very kindly furnished me with a note regarding it which is printed in extenso as an appendix to this paper.\n\nThe question now arises as to the age of these relics. It is not difficult to fix a minimum of years, since we know from various contemporary sources that Buddhism in that\ntract ceased to exist as the religion of the masses after\nthe conquest of the Buddhist kingdom of Vengi by the\nChalukyan conqueror, Kubja Vish\u1e47uvardhana, about the\nyear A.D. 605. I say \"about,\" because the actual year is\nstill a matter of some slight uncertainty; but for present\npurposes that date will suffice. Additional proof of the\ndecadence of Buddhism about that period is afforded by\nthe interesting narrative written by Hiouen Thsang (or\nHwen Thsang), the Buddhist traveller from China, who\nwas on the Krishna in the year A.D. 639. He declares\n(Si-yu-ki by Julien) that in his day the temples where\nBuddha was worshipped numbered only twenty, whereas\nthere were 100 temples erected \"to the gods\" (i.e. the\nBrahmanical gods) in the vicinity. \"For a hundred years\npast no monks (religieux) have resided here. The spirit\nof the mountain changes his form; he assumes at times\nthe figure of a wolf, at times that of a monkey, startling\nall travellers, and it is for that reason that the monastery\nis deserted, and holds no more the worshippers of the true\nFaith.\" He is speaking here of a special Vib\u0101ra, apparently\nnot many miles from Buddhap\u0101d, though the precise spot\nhas been for some years a matter of discussion. The\ncompanion volume of Ho\u00ebi-li has a similar passage: \"The\nspirits of the mountains have for the last hundred years\nchanged their demeanour, and breathe forth violence and\nrage without ceasing. Travellers, filled with terror, dare\nno longer visit the monastery; and to-day it is completely\ndeserted, so that one sees there neither monks nor novices.\"\n\nIt will be observed that Hiouen Thsang traces the de-\ncadence of Buddhism from 100 years back. Taken exactly\nthat would apply to the year A.D. 539 and it is possible,\nthough we have no historical record to prove the point,\nthat priestly influence, being on the side of the Vaishnava\nconqueror and against the titular sovereign, may have had\n\n---\n\n1 If the \"Wango\" of the Mah\u0101wanso be the same as Vengi, this kingdom\nthough small in extent boasted of high antiquity, since, according to that\nchronicle, Suppadevi, grandmother of Vijaya, the first sovereign of Ceylon,\nwas a princess of this house. The name of the ruling dynasty was S\u0101l\u0101h\u0101k\u0101ya.\nsomething to do with Vish\u1e47uvardhana's success. The statement would imply that the Brahmanical religion began to regain its hold about sixty years previous to the downfall of the Vengi kingdom. It is, of course, quite possible that these bronzes were cast during the period of decadence, so that we cannot assume for them a date positively earlier than about A.D. 650. That is the latest date. They may belong to the flourishing period, in which case we should have for them an antiquity varying from about B.C. 250\u2014the date of the great proselytizing monarch, King A\u015boka\u2014to the date already found, a period of 800 years. We know that during the earlier half of that period Buddhism flourished abundantly on the banks of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101, stupa after stupa being erected over relics of Buddha and the saints; one\u2014the stupa at Amar\u0101vati\u2014being unparalleled for magnificence.\n\nRelics of Buddha at Bh\u0101ttipr\u014dlu.\n\nThis leads me to the second portion of my subject, viz. the Buddhist monuments in the vicinity erected over the relics of Buddha, particularly the stupa at Bh\u0101ttipr\u014dlu and the relics actually found there by Mr. Rea of the Archaeological Survey.\n\nThe story of the collection of the ashes and fragmentary remains of the body of Buddha after his cremation forms the subject of the concluding portion of the \"Mah\u0101 Pari-nibb\u0101na Sutt\u0101nta,\" a work of great antiquity which has been translated by Professor Rhys Davids in vol. xi of the \"Sacred Books of the East.\" It is an account of the \"Great Decease\" of Buddha, and is the Buddhist representative of what among Christians would be called a Gospel. It was probably composed before the account of the first council of R\u0101jagaha given in the concluding part of the Chulla-ragga, but after P\u0101\u1e6daliputra, the modern Patna, had become the capital city of Magadha. It probably dates from about 100 years after Buddha's entry into nirv\u0101\u1e47a.\nThe story as there given is substantially the same as that given in all subsequent Buddhist writings and scriptures.\n\nThe cremation of the body of Buddha was carried out with great pomp and ceremony. After all was over the Mallas of Kusin\u0101r\u0101 guarded the remains. On hearing the lamentable news of the death of their master, the King of Magadha, Aj\u0101tasatru; the Lichchavi princes of Ves\u0101li; the S\u0101kyas of Kapilavatthu, Buddha's own kinsfolk; the Bulis of Allakappa; the Koliyas of R\u0101magr\u0101ma; a Brahman of Vethad\u012bpa; and the Mallas of P\u0101v\u0101, all begged for portions of the remains, promising to erect stupas over them. The remains were divided into eight portions and distributed to the eight claimants, Dona the Brahman keeping the vessel they had lain in, and the Moriyas of Pipphalivana receiving the embers of the pyre.\n\nAbout 200 years later King A\u015boka\u2014one of the only Hindu sovereigns who really held extensive sway over the whole of India, and who therefore had the actual power to do what he determined to do\u2014collected, after his conversion to Buddhism, the relics of Buddha, and distributed them all over India. He is said to have desired to erect 84,000 stupas over a similar number of genuine portions of the body of the great master.\n\nIn proof that he, at least, began to carry out his wishes we have the fact that many stupas were begun in his day, and that they were erected over relic caskets carefully secured and covered under such massive buildings of solid brick as to inspire a hope that they would remain for ever intact, like the pyramids of Egypt. We find also that A\u015boka inscribed his edicts on great boulders and cliffs in several places, even so far south as Mysore; so that history and tradition alike support the contention of modern archaeologists that several of the stupas of the south are, in their origin, at least as old as A\u015boka's time. A large group of them, probably the largest number ever erected in so small an area, is found in the neighbourhood of the mouths of the K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101, and along its banks.\nNorth-west of Amar\u0101vati there is the stupa not long since examined by Dr. Burgess and excavated by Mr. Rea, at Jaggayyap\u0113\u1e6da, north of the river. It is 30 miles from Amar\u0101vati, and is situated on the summit of a hill. Dr. Burgess, from the epigraphical evidence afforded by an inscription, considers that at least part of the building may be as old as the second century B.C.\n\nSeventeen miles east of Amar\u0101vati we have Bejv\u0101\u1e0d\u0101, or Bezwada, undoubtedly the seat of the secular government. Few Buddhist remains have been found there, but this is easily accounted for by the fact that the d\u00e9bris from the lofty hills surrounding the town, coupled with the perpetual increase to the soil of the valley owing to successive inundations from the very muddy river, have long ago buried all relics of this period deep below ground. In 1886, when digging foundations for the modern railway station, the workmen came on the topmost stone of a temple some feet underground, and, deepening their excavation, discovered a small stone shrine of the early Hindu period, the floor of which was about twelve feet below the surface. The ground-level in Buddhist days must have been even lower than that, and we may take it that about fifteen feet of solid silt, on the summit of which stand the crowded houses and streets of a busy town, cover most of the remains of that period. Two marble statues of Buddha were, however, found in the rocky d\u00e9bris under the Telegraph Hill some years ago,\u00b9 and a black granite statue of the seated Buddha (which is now, I believe, at the museum at this place) was alleged to have been removed from the top of one of the hills close to the town, on which a modern bungalow was afterwards built.\n\nTwenty-six miles east of Bezwada is Gudiv\u0101\u1e0da, the site of a very ancient town. There was a stupa here which was destroyed by our Public Works Department, and the\n\n\u00b9 I was at Bezwada, and on report being made to me that a stone face had been seen by a cooly in a channel worn in the hillside after heavy rains, I went to the spot and unearthed the two statues.\u2014R. S.\nmaterials used for road-making. The remains of the great dome were dug into and carted off, and the coolies unearthed the relic-caskets. Mr. Boswell stated that there were four caskets found in the four corners, but I cannot help thinking that this must be a mistake, and that the caskets, like those at Bha\u1e6d\u1e6dipr\u014dlu, to which I shall come presently, had been laid one above another in the centre of the basement of the structure. Of one, at least, we have positive information from a contemporary report. Under a slab of black granite, 2 ft. in diameter, was found a white marble receptacle, and in this a second receptacle also of marble. Within this were four small slabs of marble arranged so as to form a square box (such is the description\u2014the shape was probably that of a svastika with a hollow centre as at Bha\u1e6d\u1e6dipr\u014dlu). Inside this hollow chamber was a small white marble casket, and within the casket was a covered crystal cup, the relic-casket itself, in which lay a number of gold and silver flowers and some pearls and corals. These were all sent in to headquarters, and have since then disappeared.\n\nIt is believed that some of the caskets now at the Government Central Museum, Madras, were those found at Gudiv\u0101\u1e0da, but owing to carelessness there is nothing to show to what stupas these caskets belonged, and it is impossible now to classify and identify them.\n\nThere is a very fine black granite statue of Buddha at Gudiv\u0101\u1e0da, with its n\u0101ga canopy and triple umbrella complete; and as the locality is high, gravelly, dry, and situated above the inundated alluvial area, everywhere Buddhist remains\u2014beads, coins, pottery, and the like\u2014are found strewn about on the surface of the ground.\n\nFifty miles north-east of Bezwada, at Guntupalle (or N\u0101galapalle, for either name will do), is the very interesting series of rock-cut monastic dwellings, chaitya cave, vih\u0101ra, stupas, and other extensive remains, regarding which I sent a paper to this Society early in 1887 (J.R.A.S. 1887, Vol. XIX, pp. 508 to 511, and plates). It is much to be regretted that these have not yet been fully explored.\nMr. Rea has only as yet been able to make a preliminary investigation.\n\nBuddhap\u0101\u1e0d, the site of the discovery of the bronzes which form the subject of the first part of this paper, is situated twenty-nine miles south of Bezwada, and about fifteen west of Bha\u1e6d\u1e6dipr\u014d\u1e37u.\n\nA few miles east of Bha\u1e6d\u1e6dipr\u014d\u1e37u is Ghan\u1e6d\u0101s\u0101l\u0101, where the remains of a fine stupa were excavated and examined by Mr. Rea. Forty miles further, in a south-westerly direction, we come to a group of Buddhist sites clustered about a coast that must at one time have been the site of a busy trade and the residence of a large population. It was there, at Motupalle, that Marco Polo disembarked in the end of the thirteenth century A.D., there being, if not a harbour, at least fine anchorage close to shore. At the present time the whole coast is ruined by accretions of K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47\u0101 alluvium, but we may be sure that in Buddhist days Motupalle was a thriving port. The \u0100ndhra rulers of this tract adopted as one of their devices, for purposes of coinage, a two-masted sailing ship. Buddhist remains have been found in ten or a dozen places in its immediate neighbourhood. (See Mr. Rea's two Reports to the Madras Government, published in orders in July, 1888, and April, 1889.)\n\nAt Chezarla, fifty miles west-south-west of Bezwada, is a Buddhist chaitya hall converted into a Brahmanical temple; and a little to the west is Garikep\u0101\u1e0d, where Mr. Rea found a stupa.\n\nOf all these stupas, that at Bha\u1e6d\u1e6dipr\u014d\u1e37u appears to have been the largest and one of the oldest, besides being constructed of superior materials and made of solid brick throughout its great extent, while some of the others were partly filled up with earth-packing. It was faced all over with marble casing, it was surrounded with marble rails, and it had sculptured projections of marble at the cardinal points. While Dr. Burgess fixes the limits of the Amar\u0101vati tope as between B.C. 200 and A.D. 200, Dr. B\u00fchler declares the inscriptions found at Bha\u1e6d\u1e6dipr\u014d\u1e37u to be not later than B.C. 200; it may be earlier. From the centre\nof this Bha\u1e6d\u1e6dipr\u014dlu stupa,\\(^1\\) which had been so sadly ruined and disfigured that excavation had become a necessity in order to save the entombed relics, Mr. Rea in 1892 extracted three caskets (there had been four as will presently be narrated), and amongst the inscriptions found on the caskets themselves, in characters dating not later than about 250 years after the Nirv\u0101\u1e47a, was found one which explicitly states that the relics were relics of Buddha. It runs thus:\n\n\"By the father of Kura, the mother of Kura, Kura (himself) and Siva, the preparation of a casket and a box of crystal in order to deposit some relics of Buddha. By Kura the son of B\u0101nava, associated with his father, (has been given) the casket.\"\\(^2\\)\n\nThis inscription was found on the rim of the stone casket first discovered, the uppermost of the three found by Mr. Rea. Inside this casket was a globular black stone casket, and inside this a crystal casket containing a small fragment of bone. The crystal casket lay on a number of small flowers in gold leaf, and coins arranged in the form of a svastika, with some jewels.\n\nAmongst the jewels and other articles found in the outer stone casket, but outside the globular casket, was a large hexagonal head of crystal with an inscription in characters similar to the first, stating that it had been a gift from the women of a certain village and from a number of religious mendicants.\n\nBelow this first casket was found a second, somewhat similar. There was a large black stone casket outside with inscriptions on it, one of which mentions relics of the body of Buddha\\(^3\\) (Budhaska sarir\u0101ni); and another that the casket, a box of stone, and a crystal casket, had\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See Mr. Rea's \"South Indian Buddhist Antiquities,\" vol. xv of the new Imperial series of the Archaeological Survey of India (Southern India, vol. vi). The book is admirably prepared, and is a model of what such reports ought to be.\n\n\\(^2\\) Epigraphia Indica, vol. ii, p. 327\u2014Dr. B\u00fchler's article.\n\n\\(^3\\) It is mutilated, and Dr. B\u00fchler writes: \"Nothing can be said regarding the contents of this inscription, except that it mentions relics of Buddha.\" (Epigraphia Indica, ii, p. 328.)\nbeen given by certain persons, chief amongst whom was King \"Khubiraka\" (Kuberaka). In this instance, however, it is curious that no relics were found. The cavity of the outer casket was nearly filled with earth. There was no inner casket or box as described, and the crystal phial inside, the lid of which was shaped like a dagoba, was lying open with its two portions separated. There was no sign of a relic inside it, but in the outer stone casket were found a large number of gold flowers and other objects, 177 in all, a number of jewels, and a sasanam or inscription on a twisted silver leaf.\n\nBeneath this again was a third heavy stone casket also bearing inscriptions, on one of which is made further mention of King Kuberaka. The cavity was nearly filled with earth, but in it was found a crystal phial about three inches high, the two portions of which lay apart, and close to it appeared a tiny casket consisting of a single beryl bored in the centre and shaped like a relic-casket, having within it three small pieces of bone. As usual there were found surrounding it a number of small jewels, and flowers made of gold leaf.\n\nNaturally the question arises as to what likelihood there is of these sacred pieces of bone being really portions of the body of Buddha collected after his cremation, and before the idea is rejected as a simple absurdity it will be well to bear in mind certain points which must vitally affect all conclusions formed on the subject.\n\nThe tradition of the collection of relics from the funeral pyre is, as I have stated, one of very high antiquity, and that it was earnestly believed in we have ample proof in the very existence of the relic stupas.\n\nApart from this, it is only natural to suppose that the relics would have been very carefully collected. We must remember that during his lifetime (and he preached for many years) the Buddha had collected about his person an immense body of devoted adherents. His noble birth, his sacrifice of all his worldly prospects for the sake of saving the inhabitants of the world from lives of misery, his long\nyears of example and teaching, his gentle character and overflowing love for his fellow-men, would all combine together to attract round him crowds of adoring followers; so that, apart altogether from any ancient records or traditions, it would be in the highest degree surprising if relics of his body after the cremation had not been carefully collected, and reverently preserved.\n\nAs to their preservation for about 250 years and their appearance so far south as the banks of the Krishn\u0101 all arguments must, of course, be based on pure conjecture. Granting that, in the natural order of things, the relics would be carefully preserved after division, there can be no real reason why the large group of stupas erected at such vast labour in the neighbourhood of which we are speaking should not have been erected over genuine fragments\u2014possibly at the instance, or under the orders, of King A\u015boka. It is, at least, quite as likely that some of the fragments were genuine as that they were all spurious. It is hardly likely that such huge structures would in all cases be erected, at prolonged cost and with infinite labour, over forged relics. It is possible, of course, and we must be careful not to be too credulous; all I contend is, that the genuineness of the Bha\u1e6d\u1e6dipr\u014dlu relics was passionately believed in by the people as far back as b.c. 200 at latest, and that it seems just as likely that they may have been actual portions of Buddha\u2019s body, as that they may have been fragments of someone else\u2019s body substituted for the originals during the 250 years between Buddha\u2019s Nirv\u0101\u1e47a and the construction of the stupa. But it may be argued\u2014Granting that the stupa may have been erected over genuine relics, how can we assume that those found by Mr. Rea are the same as those originally placed there?\n\nThe answer is that everything points to their never having been disturbed.\n\nA stupa is nothing more or less than a gigantic relic-casket, deliberately constructed with a view to lasting durability, and for the perpetual maintenance and preservation of the relics deposited therein.\nThe Bha\u1e6d\u1e6dipr\u014dlu stupa was built in the following manner. First, foundations were dug deep in the soil, and a great circular base built of solid brick, 148 ft. in diameter, or 10 ft. larger than that of the Amar\u0101vati stupa which measured 138 ft. in diameter. Above ground this great circular mass was continued in the shape of a huge brick drum, 5 ft. high, all of solid brick, the bricks used being of great size. In the exact centre of this was left a small cylindrical hollow. The relic-caskets were placed, one above the other, in the centre of the base, but Mr. Rea found that they had been firmly built into the brickwork, the hollow alluded to being only 9 ins. in diameter, while the outer caskets measured, respectively, 2 ft. 11 ins. by 2 ft. 6 ins., 2 ft. 10 ins. by 2 ft. 3 ins., and 2 ft. 5 ins. by 2 ft. 3 ins., so that it is abundantly clear that they could not have been lifted out of the hollow at any period. Above this great drum was constructed a dome, also of solid brick, having a base of 132 ft. diameter, thus leaving a procession path round the exterior of 8 ft. in breadth. The whole of this outside surface was then encased in marble slabs, so that it presented a pure white glittering surface, visible from a great distance. Eight feet beyond the base all round was a marble rail with gateways, the total diameter of the rail measuring 164 ft.\n\nIt is thus abundantly evident that the relics were securely interned from the beginning. Now although in process of centuries, during twelve of which the religion of this tract was Brahmanical and not Buddhist, this great edifice had been sorely injured, the marble being partially pulled down and a quantity of the enclosed brickwork being pulled to pieces by the villagers, probably for house-building, it remained till a few years ago in a confused but generally circular mass 30 or 40 feet high, ruined at the top. At that period a zealous officer of the Public Works Department utilized a large quantity of the bricks\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. Rea thinks that the hollow may have been left \"as a receptacle for fixing a sweep during the progress of building to guide the correct laying of the circular rings of brickwork.\"\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1895.\nfor road-making, and a large quantity of the marble, almost all in fact that remained above ground, for the floor and walls of a small sluice in the canal close by. He dug down so far that the topmost relic-casket was found (there were originally four, one above another). There was a large outer stone casket of slabs dovetailed into one another, inside this a clay-pot, inside the pot a \"soap-stone\" casket, and inside this a crystal phial. In this phial was a pearl, a few bits of gold leaf, and some ashes. Wishing to remove his discoveries, the stone casket was accidentally broken and the remains left at Bha\u1e6d\u1e6dipr\u014d\u1e37u. The earthenware pot was broken. The inner stone casket was smashed during a voyage to England, and the fragments thrown away. And the crystal phial was presented to Dr. Burnell, and has never been seen since.\n\nIn spite of all this the height of the remains was, when I saw it first, about 14 or 15 feet, and it remained in this condition till Mr. Rea's excavation.\n\nMr. Rea found the circular courses of the portion that remained entirely untouched, the small central 9-inch well remaining as it had been originally constructed, with eight large bricks radiating from it, and \"another ring of sixteen wedge-shaped bricks each placed with the apex pointing to the centre.\" The little well \"went down with its sides straight for a depth of 5 ft. 9 ins. from the (then) surface.\" \"Below that the courses were stepped, leaving alternate diameters of 9\u00bd ins. and 1 ft. 3 ins.\" Below all this were the caskets, one above the other, the outer ones in each case being so large that they could never have been disturbed.\n\nIf any additional proof be demanded that the caskets had never been disturbed during the 2092 years from B.C. 200 to A.D. 1892, it may be noted that had such been the case the disturbers would have rifled the caskets and\n\n---\n\n1 Perhaps really marble.\n2 Dr. Burgess conjectures (Epigraphia Indica, vol. ii, Preface) that the disturbance of the inner caskets had probably been caused by the accidental shaking of the whole by the workmen who originally placed them in position, and this seems the most reasonable supposition.\ncarried off all the gold flowers, coins, and precious stones that were found therein. The presence of these in the caskets is by itself almost conclusive proof that the caskets had been left untouched during that long period. I should add that the relics are now lying carefully preserved in a glass case in the Government Central Museum at Madras.\n\nAPPENDIX.\n\nThe Inscription on the Pedestal from Bezw\u0101d\u0101.\n\nBy Dr. B\u00fchler, Ph.D., C.I.E.\n\nThe three fragments of the copper pedestal from Bezw\u0101d\u0101 bear an inscription, mutilated at both ends, in a single line of southern characters, which runs as follows:\n\nA, right side,\u00b9 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u0915\u093e\u0928\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0915\u0947\u0903-\nB, centre piece,\u00b2 \u091a\u092e\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0940 \u092a\u0930\u093e\u092e\u0927\u093e\u092e\u0935\u0940\u0915\u0930\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0903 \u0935\u093f\u0928\u092f\u0947-\nC, left side,\u00b3 \u0928 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nThe first syllable of A is slightly mutilated on the left, but enough remains to make the reading certain. In B the ninth syllable is divided into two halves by the break. If the two fragments are joined ci is distinctly visible. The twelfth and the sixteenth syllables of B are damaged by verdigris, but not doubtful.\n\nThe language of the inscription is Sanskrit. The spelling shews the common doubling of the consonants immediately preceded by r, and an unusual retention of the visarga\n\n\u00b9 Height, 2\u00b79 ins.; length below, 2 ins.; above, 1 in.\n\u00b2 Length above, 9\u00b76 ins.; below, 10\u00b76 ins.; height at both ends, 2\u00b79 ins.; in the middle, 1\u00b77 ins.\n\u00b3 Length below, 1\u00b72 ins.; above, \u00bd in.\nbefore the media ja. The rhythm in the extant syllables suggests that the document was metrical, and consisted of an anu\u1e63\u1e6dubh \u015bloka:\n\nAnd with this supposition the visarga would be admissible, as it would stand at the end of a pada where the sandhi may be neglected. According to their sense the preserved words belong to two mutilated sentences . . . . kr\u0101ntir Jayamati and par\u0101m arc\u0101m acikarat tasy\u0101\u1e25 Jinasena . . . . The last five words mean\u2014\"Jinasena caused to be made a most excellent image of her.\" Though Jinasena, a well-known Buddhist and Jaina proper name, has not the sign of the nominative, which probably formed part of the next lost syllable, it is no doubt the subject of the verb acikarat, the third person singular of the aorist of k\u0101rayati, \"he causes to be made.\" The object of the verb is arc\u0101m, the singular accusative of arc\u0101, literally \"an object of worship,\" and conventionally \"a statue of a deity.\" The genitive tasy\u0101\u1e25 \"of her,\" which arc\u0101m governs, shows that a separate sentence preceded that beginning with par\u0101m arc\u0101m, and that this contained the name of a goddess. The name has in all probability to be looked for in Jayamati, literally \"the victorious one.\" Jayamati is known from the R\u0101jatar\u0101\u1e45gin\u012b as a female proper name. This will not do here, as arc\u0101 can refer only to the statue of a deity. Now according to the Trik\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d\u0101\u015be\u1e63a the Buddhists called their great goddess T\u0101r\u0101, also Jay\u0101 \"Victoria,\" and considering that the Hindus very frequently, especially in poetry, substitute synonyms for the names of their gods, e.g. girisut\u0101, adrija, and so forth, for P\u0101rvat\u012b, Jayamati may be used legitimately for Jay\u0101 or T\u0101r\u0101. It agrees with this explanation, that the dedicator, Jinasena, must have been, according to the etymological meaning of his name, either a Buddhist or a Jaina, and that Bezw\u0101d\u0101 actually was the site of a great Buddhist establishment.\nThe remaining word of the first sentence kr\u0101ntir (kr\u0101ntih), the singular nominative of kr\u0101nti, \"gait, walking, onslaught, the ecliptic,\" gives by itself no appropriate sense. But, if it is taken as the remnant of a bahuvrihi compound, it may have belonged to an adjective describing Jayamati or T\u0101r\u0101. As T\u0101r\u0101 is the great protectress of mankind (Wassilief, Der Buddhismus, p. 125), the compound probably expressed the idea that the goddess saves from the onslaught (kr\u0101nti) of misfortune. The metre would require a phrase like [j\u012bt\u0101nartha]kr\u0101ntir or possibly [vihat\u0101nartha], \"who conquers the onslaught of misfortune.\" The verb belonging to the two nouns of the first sentence can only have been vijayati or jayati, \"is victorious.\" I would, therefore, propose to fill up the two breaks as follows:\n\n[\u0935\u093f\u091c\u092f\u0924\u093f \u0935\u093f\u0924\u093e\u0928\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902] \u091c\u092f\u092e\u0924\u0940 \u0935\u093f\u0924\u093e\u0928\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902 \u092a\u0930\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902\u0964\n\u091c\u092f\u092e\u0924\u0940 \u0935\u093f\u0924\u093e\u0928\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902 \u0935\u093f\u0928\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0917\u0902 [\u0935\u093f\u0926\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902]\n\n\"[Victorious is that] Jayamati [who conquers] the onslaught [of misfortune]. Jinasena, [who bows to her], caused to be made a most excellent image of that (deity).\"\n\nI claim, of course, no more than a certain measure of probability for this restoration, but I believe the interpretation of the general import of the fragment, viz. that it records the dedication of a statue of Jayamati-T\u0101r\u0101 by one Jinasena, to be more than a mere conjecture.\n\nThe date of the inscription probably lies between 900 and 1000 A.D. The letters agree very closely with those of the inscriptions of the R\u0101\u1e63trak\u016b\u1e6da king K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a II incised in \u015aakasamvat 822 and 831 (Ind. Ant. xi, p. 126, and xii, p. 220 ff.), and of the Eastern Calukya grant, issued about \u015aakasamvat 817 (Ind. Ant. vii, p. 16). But it may also fall a little earlier.\nART. XIX.\u2014Sinhalese Copper-plate Grants in the British Museum. By Don Martinu de Zilva Wickremasinghe.\n\nThere are three Sinhalese sannas (grants of land) on copper-plate amongst the Sinhalese MSS. of the British Museum, catalogued under the press-marks Add. 11,555 a, b, and c. The sannas were presented to the British Museum by Mr. J. Barlow Hoy as long ago as the 30th of March, 1839. But who Mr. Hoy was and how he got them I have not been able to find out. The two marked b and c are neatly engraved on smooth rectangular copper-plates, measuring $10\\frac{6}{8}$\" by $2\\frac{1}{8}$\" and $12\\frac{3}{8}$\" by $2$\" respectively, leaving in each case a margin on the obverse side to the left, in which the royal symbol \u00c7ri, signifying prosperity, is cut in large type. The other sannasa\u00b9 (a) is ornamented with a plain silver border running round the rectangular plate of copper, $16\\frac{4}{8}$\" by $3$\" in size. The letters are well cut, with kundali flourishes at the beginning and end of each line. On the left of the obverse is the usual margin, which is here separated from the text by a thin silver band right across the plate, so as to receive a large-sized \u00c7ri engraved boldly.\n\nThe first sannasa (Add. 11,555 c) has ten lines, five on each side, with kundali to mark important words and clauses. It is dated \"Wednesday, the 11th day of the waxing moon of the month of Durutu,\u00b2 in the year [cycle], named Prajapati, \u00c7aka 1673\" (A.D. 1751). The second (11,555 b) also has ten lines, five on each side, also with kundali both at the beginning and end of each line, and\n\n\u00b9 Sannasa (plur. sannas), a grant of land on copper-plate or palmyra leaf.\n\u00b2 Parts of January and February.\nin the body of the text indicating important words and clauses. It bears the date \"Saturday, the 13th day of the waning moon of the month of Durutu, in the year, named T\u0101run\u0101, \u00c7aka 1686\" (A.D. 1764). There seems to be no doubt as to the genuineness of these two sannas, granted, as they are, by the then ruling monarch, Kirti \u00c7ri R\u0101jasimha (1747\u20131778 A.D.), and agreeing in their phraseology with another grant of this king, viz. the Ga\u1e6daberiya Sannasa of 1760 A.D., published in Mr. Bell's Archaeological Report on the Kegalla District (Colombo, 1892), p. 99, and not improbably with the sannas of Lenagala (1754 A.D.), Het\u1e6dimulla (1757), Vekoladeniya (1757), and Duldeniya (1761), attributed to the same king (l.c. p. 105).\n\nThe third sannasa under consideration, marked Add. 11,555 a, is dated \"Friday, the 11th day of the waning moon of the month of Ma\u1e0dindina,\" in the year, named Rudhirodg\u0101ri, \u00c7aka 1725\" (A.D. 1803), and contains fourteen lines, seven on each side. It is one of those granted by the last Kandyan king, \u00c7ri-vikrama R\u0101jasimha, who reigned at Kandy from 1798 to 1815. The inscriptions, royal grants, and other public documents of this and of the latter part of the previous century are easily to be recognized by the language in which they are written. The redundant style, the loose construction, and the mass of Sanskrit words used in preference to their more suitable Sinhalese equivalents, are indeed distasteful, and contrary to the real spirit and original simplicity of the language.\n\n1 I may be permitted to point out that the Sinhalese \u0101 and its lengthened form \u0101 which have the sounds of a in \"cat,\" \"bed,\" or \"man,\" as well as some of the sounds in the Tamil language, such as \u1e43, \u1e6d, etc., are not represented in the scheme of transliteration adopted by the Society. I think the Sinhalese \u0101 is better transcribed with a dot under a (\u00e4) than with \u0101, as is customary in Ceylon, considering that it is but a kind of \"umlaut\" of a.\n\n2 Parts of March and April.\n\n3 Cf. the fine Molligoda sannasa in Mr. Bell's report, p. 101.\nThe following are transcripts and translations of the three sannas:\n\n**Sannasa.

XX.\u2014Some Notes on Past and Future Archaeological Explorations in India. By G. B\u00fcHLER, Hon. Member Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nJust thirty-five years ago, in 1860, the Government of India agreed to institute an Archaeological Survey of Upper India, and thus to take an active part in the exploration of the numerous and extensive historical remains of the country, which task until then had been left to the desultory efforts (occasionally aided by grants from the public funds) of the learned societies and private individuals. Adverse circumstances, however, very soon counteracted the effects of this official recognition of the claims of antiquarian research to continued Government assistance and guidance. Already in 1866 financial pressure induced Lord Lawrence to stop the work which Sir A. Cunningham had barely begun. The Survey was abolished, and there followed a regrettable time of inaction, which lasted until 1870, when, in consequence of urgent representations from various influential quarters, and especially from eminent members of the Royal Asiatic Society, the Secretary of State and the Supreme Government of India consented to return to the principle laid down in 1860. The next result was the re-opening of the Archaeological Survey for the Northern half of India, which was now organized on a larger scale, and the issue of orders by the Secretary of State for the registration and preservation of the historical monuments all over India. Soon afterwards, in 1873, the Government of Bombay was permitted to establish a survey of its own for the Western Presidency, and somewhat later the Government of Madras likewise directed its attention to the\ncollection of notes regarding the antiquities of Southern India and to their scientific exploration. The movement, begun in 1870, continued in full force for nearly twenty years, and extended during this period even to the more advanced Native States. The Mah\u0101r\u0101jas of Mysore, Baroda, Bhaunagar; Jepur and Udepur in Rajputana, and others, either availed themselves of the services of the Archaeological Surveyors or established small departments of their own, among which the Jepur and Mysore Surveys especially have furnished most valuable contributions. But in 1889, with the abolition of the post of the Director-General of the Survey, a reaction began, which since has become more and more perceptible. The number of the Provincial Surveyors who at first were allowed to continue their work has been reduced almost every year, and the few men still kept on are engaged merely for short terms, some of which are now close on their expiration. These facts look as if the statements, now and then appearing in the newspapers, were not without foundation according to which Government intends, or at least is not disinclined, to sever its connection with antiquarian research in a few years, and perhaps to entirely withdraw its aid.\n\nEven the possibility of such a prospect naturally causes deep concern and regret to all those engaged or interested in Indian research, as the stoppage of Government assistance would most seriously impede, perhaps make impossible, the further reconstruction of the political, religious, and literary history of India, which undoubtedly possesses a great and general interest, not only for the Hindus but for the whole civilized world. The possibility of such a prospect makes it also incumbent on all Orientalists and friends of India to raise their voice and once more to urge on the Indian Government the necessity for the continuation of the enlightened policy adopted in 1870, in spite of the no doubt considerable financial difficulties of the present day. Already the late Congress of Geneva has spoken on the subject, and has passed a resolution addressing a petition to Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India and to the\nViceroy in favour of the preservation of the A\u015boka inscriptions, and of the preparation of impressions to be deposited in the Imperial Museum at Calcutta. Something more is, however, required, and with the hope that the Royal Asiatic Society, which is most nearly concerned with the question, and whose action will, no doubt, possess the greatest influence, may be induced to move in the matter, I venture to offer, at the request of a distinguished member of its Council, the subjoined notes on past and present arch\u00e6ological explorations, intended to show the necessity of the continuation of the work and to indicate the direction in which it ought to be carried on.\n\nThe operations falling within the province of the Arch\u00e6ological Survey may be classed under three main heads\u2014(1) the registration of the visible architectural and epigraphic monuments, as well as the description and the identification of the ancient ruins; (2) the preparation of exact reproductions of the visible monuments and their publication, with the necessary explanations, viz. scientific discussions of the sculptures and architectural details, as well as transcripts and translations of the inscriptions; and (3) excavations of the more promising and historically important fields of ruins.\n\nWork of all these three classes has been undertaken by the officers of the Arch\u00e6ological Survey, with the assistance of a large number of outsiders, but the amount of attention which each has received and the results actually achieved vary very considerably. With the description of the old sites and the registration of the visible monuments, which naturally must precede the other operations and at the same time presented least difficulties, by far the greatest progress has been made.\n\nThe several Series of Survey Reports and Papers contain an enormous mass of information regarding the location of many thousands of architectural monuments, sculptures, and inscriptions, scattered over nearly the whole of India, and, though additions no doubt would be possible for most districts, they yet give the arch\u00e6ologist a very good general\nidea where the chief fields for his labours lie. There is only one larger tract, Western Rajputana, which has not yet received its due share of attention. It is also highly desirable that the notes should be arranged for all the Presidencies and minor territorial divisions as systematically and intelligibly as has been done by Mr. Sewell for Madras,\u00b9 and by Dr. F\u00fchrer for the N.W. Provinces.\u00b2\n\nWith respect to the operations falling under the second head, the preparation of drawings and photographs of architectural monuments and sculptures, and of impressions of inscriptions, as well as their publication, it is only possible to say that a very fair beginning has been made. Something appreciable has no doubt been done, but much more remains to be accomplished.\n\nAs regards Indian art, Sir A. Cunningham\u2019s volumes on Bharahut and Gay\u0101, Major Cole\u2019s photographs, and Colonel Maisey\u2019s work on Sanchi give, together with Dr. Fergusson\u2019s older publication, a good general idea of its state during the Maurya and \u015au\u1e45ga periods. But it is a matter of regret that the sculptures of the Sanchi and Bharahut Stupas have not been published all and throughout on such a scale as to be of service to the student of archaeology. The art of the Andhra period has been illustrated very fully by Dr. Burgess in several volumes of his Arch. Survey Reports, and has been treated systematically by the same scholar and Dr. Fergusson in the \u201cCave Temples of India.\u201d To Dr. Burgess\u2019 Reports we owe also our knowledge of the development of Indian art during the rule of the Chalukyas and R\u0101\u1e63\u1e6drak\u016b\u1e6das over the northern Dekhan, and of the Chaulukyas and J\u0113\u1e6dhv\u0101s over Gujarat and Kathiawar. Further publications referring to Southern India, and based on Dr. Burgess\u2019 own and others\u2019 ample collections of photographs and drawings (mostly in the India Office),\n\n\u00b9 Lists of Antiquities of Madras.\n\u00b2 Architectural Monuments and Inscriptions of the North-West Provinces. I am glad to see that Dr. F\u00fchrer\u2019s Progress Report for 1893\u201394, which reached me after the above notes were written, speaks of the preparation of such a compilation for the Panjab.\nare in course of preparation. Mr. Griggs' plucky resolution to publish autotypes of the Ajanta Paintings will satisfy another want, long felt by all archaeologists.\n\nAs regards Upper and Central India, many notices and illustrations of monuments from the times of the Indo-Scythians, the Guptas, the P\u0101las, Chandellas, Kalachuris, and other dynasties, as well as important discussions on various styles of architecture, are scattered in Sir A. Cunningham's Survey Reports. But not a single period has been treated exhaustively, or with such details as to give a perfectly clear idea of all its characteristics. The Survey Reports are a perfect mine of information and of most valuable suggestions, but difficult to use for any but those few students who possess other extensive collections of materials. The real work, I fear, has still to be done for the districts to which the Survey Reports refer, and it is a task of very considerable magnitude, which will require years, not only of office work but of new researches in the ancient sites\u2014even if merely the most important periods and styles are taken up. To the most pressing wants belong systematically arranged comprehensive works on all the known so-called Indo-Grecian sculptures, of which Major Cole's photographs only give a portion, and on the native Indian art of the Indo-Scythian and Gupta periods.\n\nWith respect to Epigraphy, for which, owing to the insufficiency of the earlier facsimiles and estampages, a new beginning had to be made, matters stand, no doubt, even better. But much, very much, has still to be done before the accessible monuments can all be published in critical editions. Thanks to the efforts of Drs. Burgess, Fleet, F\u00fchrer, and Hultzsch, trustworthy impressions of all the inscriptions of the Maurya period have been prepared, and very good facsimiles of most of them have appeared in the Epigraphia Indica and the Indian Antiquary. The only desiderata for this period are complete photolithographs of the Shahbazgarhi and Mansehra Rock Edicts, of the Bairat Edict to the Sangha, the otherwise excellent autotype of\nwhich, published by M. Senart in the Journal Asiatique, is on too small a scale, and of the newly discovered Nigliva Pillar Edicts, as well as perhaps some more specimens of the 450 small votive inscriptions from the Sanchi Stupas. Among the few inscriptions of the next two centuries the large Hathigumpha inscription of Kh\u0101ravela requires a good impression and facsimile. As regards the \u015aaka and Kushana periods, the inscriptions in Kharoshth\u012b must nearly all be re-edited with facsimiles, and the series of those in Br\u0101hma characters has to be completed. The partly contemporaneous and partly somewhat later documents of the Western Kshatrapas, the Andhras, and the Abhiras require, with the exception of a few inscriptions from Kathiawar and a certain number from Kanheri, nothing further than what has been done for them by Dr. Burgess in his Survey Reports of Western India. The epigraphic remains of the dynasties ruling in Western India and the Northern Dekhan during the fifth and later centuries, have been published in great abundance in the Indian Antiquary, the Western India Reports, the Epigraphia Indica, and in the Journal Bom. Br. Roy. As. Soc.\u00b9\n\nThe inscriptions from Southern India are well represented in the volume of the Southern India Reports, the Indian Antiquary, the Epigraphia Indica, and Dr. Hultzsch\u2019s two volumes of South-Indian inscriptions. But in spite of the great progress made, especially since Dr. Hultzsch\u2019s appointment as epigraphist, there is work for many years, as the number of the known, but untouched, inscriptions in the Madras Presidency amounts to many thousands.\n\nAmong the inscriptions of the dynasties which held Central and Upper India after the Indo-Scythic period, those of the Guptas alone have been edited fully and on scientific principles\u2014by Dr. Fleet in vol. iii of the Corpus Inscrip. Indicarum. For the documents belonging to all the other\n\n\u00b9 Additional unpublished documents are, however, in existence, especially in the collections of the late Dr. Bhagv\u0101n\u012bl\u0101l, who, in the Bombay Gazetteer, mentions, or gives extracts from, various Silah\u0101ra and Sendraka inscriptions in his possession.\nnumerous races a great deal remains to be done. Though the *Indian Antiquary*, the *Epigraphia Indica*, and the later volumes of the Journ. As. Soc. of Bengal contain, perhaps, a hundred or more inscriptions of the later rulers of Kanauj, of the P\u0101las, Senas, the kings of Nepal, the Kalachuris, Chandellas, and Param\u0101ras, and of other less notable families, in good editions and with good reproductions, there are several hundreds noticed or given in insufficient facsimiles in the Archaeological Survey Reports of India. A number of tours will have to be undertaken in order to collect the fresh materials, and the work will take years.\n\nAs regards the operations falling under the third head, the excavations, it is impossible to deny that little has been done beyond what might be called \"prospecting.\" A very considerable number of Stupas have no doubt been opened, rifled of their deposits, and searched for inscriptions. Surface diggings and small clearings have also been made and archaeological wells have been sunk, as Sir A. Cunningham's Reports show, in many of the ancient mounds and fields of ruins. But really scientific excavations, as understood at present, which lay bare the whole of the monuments or sites to be explored, have been attempted only in very few places, as at Sanchi, Gay\u0101, Bharahut, Amar\u0101vati, Jaggayapeta, and quite recently at Bha\u1e6d\u1e6diprolu, and in the Kankali Tila at Mathur\u0101. In all these cases only single monuments or small groups have been attacked, which, with a single exception, are not situated in the ancient centres of civilization, but either in isolated positions or in towns, which have sprung up and become famous as places of pilgrimage in consequence of the existence of the monuments. And all the monuments excavated belong (again with one exception) solely to the Buddhists, who were, as recent researches have shown more and more clearly, by no means the oldest nor the only important sect of ancient India.\n\nThe reasons which have induced the Indian archaeologists to pay less attention to excavations than to the other branches of their work, are clear enough and perfectly\nsufficient. It was, no doubt, their first duty to ascertain and register the localities where the historical remains are found, and to make known the monuments still visible on the surface. And the costliness of extensive excavations made it advisable either merely \"to prospect\" or to attempt a full exploration only in such places where success was an absolute certainty.\n\nThe results, which even these restricted operations have yielded, undeniably possess a very high value. They have extended our knowledge of Indian art very considerably. They have brought to light many hundreds of epigraphic documents, some of which, like those on the Jaina sculptures at Mathur\u0101, are of the first importance for the political and religious history of India, while others, like the inscriptions on the Bha\u1e6d\u1e6diprolu relic caskets, and the masons' alphabet at Gay\u0101, are invaluable for palaeography. They have even thrown a new light on a portion of the ancient Buddhist literature, as the inscribed medallions at Bharahut permit us now to ascribe with confidence a high antiquity to the important J\u0101taka texts. This undeniable and great success is certainly a strong argument in favour of further excavations. But I believe that a still stronger case may be made out for their continuation on a definite plan, framed in accordance with the experiences gained, and with the most pressing wants of Indian historical research.\n\nA real progress with the reconstruction of Indian history can only be made if new authentic documents are obtained, such as are older than A\u015boka's, as well as such as will fill up the great gaps which occur in the second and first centuries B.C. and in the third and fourth centuries A.D. And such will be only found underground, and partly only at a considerable depth. The expectation that inscriptions of the times of the first two Mauryas, and of the dynasties which preceded them in the fourth and fifth centuries, may and will turn up, is, I think, by no means unfounded. Both the literary and the palaeographic evidence shows that the art of writing was known and extensively practised in India for several centuries before A\u015boka's times, and\nthere are even some inscribed coins, which cannot be later than the fourth century. To these belong certainly the Persian Sigloi, with countermarks in Kharoshthi and Br\u0101hm\u012b, discovered by Mr. Rapson, and very probably some of the native Indian coins found by Sir A. Cunningham at Taxila, Eran, and in other ancient sites. Moreover, the probability that writing was used, not only for marking coins but for longer inscriptions, becomes very strong, through certain stories contained in the Buddhist canon. The J\u0101takas tell us that kings inscribed \"the laws of the Kurus,\" the maxims of good government, and verses of their own composition on gold plates, and that even merchants perpetuated the record of their family history in the same manner; and the Mah\u0101vagga speaks of a proclaimed thief, whose name was put up in the royal palace. Such statements certainly point to the conclusion that the times when they were written were not destitute of epigraphic documents, and the works in which they occur appear to be older than the third century. With respect to the other two periods mentioned, which fall after A\u015boka's times, there can be no doubt that they were rich in epigraphic documents, and that remnants will turn up if they are looked for in the right places. At present we possess barely a dozen inscriptions from the second and first centuries B.C., and the period from 200\u2013350 A.D. is for Upper India almost a blank.\n\nThe answer to the question where our desiderata may be expected to turn up and should be looked for, can only be that the search for them must be instituted in those fields of ruins which the Archaeological Survey has proved to be the remains of the capitals of the ancient empires, or of great centres of the national life. Such sites are chiefly found in Upper India, where their number is so great that their exploration cannot possibly be undertaken at once, even if the Government of India could be induced to sanction as large an expenditure on archaeological work as the sums allotted to the Survey in its palmiest days. If a practical result is to be attained, a selection must be\nmade, and a few of those places be chosen for thorough excavations where the results are likely to be most important. And I believe that it will be amply sufficient if I point out three, one for each of the great territorial divisions of Upper India, and briefly give my opinion about their respective merits.\n\nThe most important historical site in the whole of India is, without a question, Patna-P\u0101\u1e6daliputra, which was the seat of the Government of India in the days of the Nandas and Mauryas (between ca. 420\u2013195 B.C.), and probably the capital of an important kingdom even in much later times. It seems most wonderful that the numerous ruins in such a place should have remained unexcavated for so long a time. The reason probably is that the first surveyors believed the ancient buildings to have been swept away by the river. But now both Sir A. Cunningham and Dr. Waddell, the latest authorities on the historical remains of Patna, though differing in details, agree that the ruins of the palaces of the Nandas and of A\u015boka, and those of the other buildings described by the Chinese pilgrims, are traceable. Moreover, Dr. Waddell points out a number of workable places, in which ancient sculptures have been found and are still being found. This is sufficient to justify an attempt at thorough excavations, which, if carried on with the necessary care and perseverance, will no doubt place the ancient history of India on a much sounder and more solid basis.\u00b9\n\nNext in importance would be the continuation of the explorations at Mathur\u0101, and thorough excavations in the ruins of Shah Deri or Taxila. With respect to Mathur\u0101, the important finds of Pandit Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l, the results obtained by Sir A. Cunningham and by Dr. Burgess, and the splendid success of Dr. F\u00fchrer in 1889\u201391, which put the history of the Jaina sect into altogether a new light, do not leave the slightest doubt that its numerous untouched\n\n\u00b9 I am glad to see that Dr. F\u00fchrer's Progress Report for 1893-94, which came into my hands after the above notes were written, holds out the prospect of an excavation of A\u015boka's palace during the next season.\nor superficially explored mounds will yield a great store of important inscriptions and valuable sculptures. Their persistent and careful exploration will certainly throw light on the dark period between 200\u2013350 A.D., and bring additions to the inscriptions of the second and first centuries B.C. Possibly it may also produce something for the period before Asoka, as the Greek accounts prove the existence of the worship of Krishna in the fourth century B.C. Perhaps a search, instituted in the accessible parts of the Katra Mound, under which lies inter alia the old temple of Kesava, may lead to discoveries which are of importance for the history of Vaishnavism.\n\nThe selection of Shah Deri or Taxila for operations in the Panjab seems advisable for many reasons. Its ruins, among which Sir A. Cunningham has traced fifty-five Stupas, twenty monasteries, and nine temples, extend over six square miles, and are, according to the same authority, in a better state of preservation than those of any old town in the Panjab. Even with the \"prospecting\" undertaken hitherto, they have furnished various very important inscriptions, like the Society's famous copper-plate of Patika, as well as numerous highly interesting sculptures, among them, according to Sir A. Cunningham, the only real Greek column ever found in India, and a large number of very valuable coins, some of which are inscribed with legends in the oldest Kharoshthi and Brahma characters, and probably belong to the end of the fourth century. To these points may be added that, according to numerous passages of the Buddhist canon, Taxila was the greatest university of India during the fifth and fourth centuries B.C., and possibly earlier, to which even the Brahmans and Kshatriyas of Benares and Eastern India flocked in order to study the three Vedas and the eighteen branches of science under world-renowned teachers, and that also the Greek authors bear witness to its wealth and importance. The site of such a city, which besides was for a long time\n\n1 Arch. Survey Rep., vol. ii, p. 111 ff.\nunder Greek rule, will, if patiently and carefully explored, in all probability yield results important for the history of various periods.\n\nThe circumstances stated furnish, it seems to me, good reasons for making an effort to secure the continuation of the arch\u00e6ological and epigraphic work in India. And if it is decided to make such an effort, the points to which particular prominence ought to be given are, in my opinion\u2014\n\n(1) The maintenance of an Arch\u00e6ological Survey, with at least one duly qualified officer for each of the larger territorial divisions, especially for those of Upper India.\n\n(2) The necessity of employing these Arch\u00e6ological Surveyors both to fill up the gaps left in the work of former years (mentioned above under heads 1-2), and to carry on thorough and scientific excavations, which, in the first instance, should be restricted to the most important site in each province (whether that proposed above or some other found to be more suitable on further consideration), and should be continued until the site is completely cleared.\n\n(3) The continuation of the epigraphic work, particularly in Madras, under a competent Epigraphist, who should also, as under the present arrangements, edit the *Epigraphia Indica*, the future existence of which periodical ought likewise to be assured.\n\n(4) In addition it would be, perhaps, advisable to call attention to the fact that the consultation of experts or of the Asiatic Societies of India, and England, with reference to the work of the Arch\u00e6ological Surveyors, would be most beneficial and important for the due progress of their work.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n\n1. RAJUKA OR LAJUKA.\n\nNetherclay House, Taunton,\nApril 24th, 1895.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014In a short article at p. 466, vol. xlvii, of the Zeitschrift d. D.M.G., Dr. B\u00fchler proves that the word Lajuka or Rajuka, used in Asoka's edicts to denote some high official, is a shortened form of Rajjuggahaka (=Skr.-grahaka) \"rope-holder,\" and that the title was derived from the circumstance that the official in question was employed (probably among other things) in measuring fields with a rope for the purpose of assessing them to land revenue, then, as now, one of the most important duties of officials in India. This derivation seems on all grounds unassailable, but I may, perhaps, point out a curious confirmation of it in an official title still existing. As is well known, the chief native official in a collector's office (and in many other offices also) is still known by the title of \"Serishtadar,\" as it is commonly written. This is the Persian phrase, \u0633\u0631 \u0631\u0634\u062a\u0647 \u062f\u0627\u0631 sar-i rishta d\u0101r, literally \"he who holds the end of a rope.\" We have been accustomed to regard the word as meaning \"one who conducts or rules the sarrishta,\" and the term \"sarrishta\" is now commonly used to imply an office or department. But by what far-fetched metaphor it came to have this meaning I never could understand. The matter seems now clear. Dr. B\u00fchler rightly denies to Todar Mal, the great finance\nminister of Akbar, the honour of having invented the modern land-revenue system of India. He, of course, merely modified and improved a system which had been in existence for centuries before his time. But he probably found the old Prakrit term r\u0101juka in common use, and naturally enquired into its meaning, which he forthwith translated into Persian sar-i rishta d\u0101r. It is true that a modern sarishtadar's duties are no longer confined to settlement work, nor does he often condescend to hold the rope himself. But the rope is still used for measuring lands in settlement proceedings, where it has not been superseded by the bamboo laggi, or the more scientific Gunter's chain, and Dr. B\u00fchler's explanation is undoubtedly the solution of the puzzle which has exercised so many English officers in India, why the highly respectable and experienced head of a large office should be designated by the simple title of \"one who holds the end of a rope.\"\n\n\u2014Yours truly,\n\nJOHN BEAMES.\n\n2. VIDY\u0100DHARA PITAKA.\n\nIn the letter from Mons. Louis de la Vall\u00e9e Poussin, in our last issue, readers are requested to correct the following misprints:\n\np. 435, lines 13, 23, for Tap\u0101s read Jap\u0101s.\np. 436, line 6, ,, correct ,, collect.\n,, line 29 ,, Kangika ,, Kau\u1e63ika.\n\n3. ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH.\n\nSir,\u2014The discussion of Hofrath G. B\u00fchler's proposals as to future Archaeological Research in India ended without any definite vote of our meeting on June 11th; and I myself, speaking late and pressed for time, could say little. I have, therefore, the honour to offer the following remarks in black and white:\u2014\nThe first point in the matter is, that in the present state of Indian finance the Government of India cannot be expected to spend much money on research.\n\nThe second is, that any researches carried out by other machinery are likely to be unsystematic in execution, and still more in record, especially in the case of excavations. These, if not most carefully planned and supervised, are apt to obliterate more than they bring to light. And unless their record is kept, at the pit's mouth, by a skilled observer, what is brought to light might often much better have been left under the kindly protection of the earth, until time and funds were available for deliberate and thorough research. It happens that small objects are overlooked or stolen by the coolies; that the exact position of objects found escapes observation, or is even misstated; and that heavy materials, such as sculptures or walls, are left exposed, and destroyed, misappropriated, or injured by mere weather-wear. All these things have happened within my own experience, and in that of many other members of our Society. I need only touch upon the obvious probability of waste of money.\n\nWhat has chiefly to be considered is how the risk of fruitless or mischievous research is to be, as far as possible, avoided, at reduced expense, until better days come.\n\nIn quoting Hofrath B\u00fchler's paper I must, of course, trust to memory; and write subject to correction. But his principal point, as I take it, is that there should be in each province an officer acting as the arch\u00e6ological adviser of Government; without consulting whom\n\n(a) No expenditure of public funds on arch\u00e6ological research should be sanctioned.\n\n(b) No object of arch\u00e6ological interest in the possession (or under the control) of Government should be disposed of.\n\n(c) No excavation, or other research, likely to alter the condition or position of any such object should be encouraged by any public servant, even in regard to places and objects not directly under such control.\n(d) And through whom all such researches should, as far as possible, be reported to the Provincial Government.\n\nThis proposal, in a general way, appeared to have had the approval of the meeting. It is eminently practicable, as might be expected from a scholar distinguished, amongst those who knew him well, for administrative skill and intimate knowledge of district and political business in the mofussil.\n\nIn a province where financial exigencies prevent the appointment of a special Archaeological Surveyor, it may frequently be found possible to assign the duties of the office to some qualified officer of the Revenue, Educational, or Public Works Department, \"in addition to his own duties,\" with or without addition to his personal salary; but, of course, with a proper establishment and accommodation, which need not be very costly.\n\nOnly those who have very lately served in India can know how much the work of the past has increased general interest and individual acquirements, in archaeology as in other sciences, amongst Her Majesty's servants in that country. In the departments named the average level of acquirement in such matters is such as would have earned special notice only twenty years ago. I am speaking here especially of Archaeology, which comes most home to their officers. Other branches of science are more in the way of those of other departments, though there is no branch of the service without antiquaries, particularly numismatists. There are, indeed, competent scholars outside of the services; but their presence only requires acknowledgment here, as an archaeological officer of Government must necessarily be its servant, and under its full control. The business is one which could not, I think, be properly assigned even to the local learned societies.\n\nI need not here discuss the duties of an archaeological surveyor, well enough ascertained by experience, nor the methods of research which he should adopt, nor even the fields of operation. Enough about these matters was said at the meeting of the 11th of June by other speakers.\nBut there is one point of detail too often neglected in India, and that is the necessity of recording possession and proper custody of such objects as sculptures. These are not unfrequently brought into offices, courts, gardens of public buildings, or store-yards, fit enough to hold them, at least for a time. But it commonly happens that they are simply left there, and not entered in the stock-books as Government property; for the custody of which some particular public servant is responsible. In consequence, their provenance and ownership soon become mere matter of tradition amongst underlings; and they are too often mislaid or misappropriated.\n\nIt should be a standing order of all departments that such objects should be entered in the stock-books, just as much as office chairs and tables worth a few rupees, and copy of the entry sent to the Archaeological Surveyor.\n\nW. F. Sinclair.\n\nJune 12th, 1895.\n\nTo the Secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\n4. The Jains.\n\nThe Homestead, Barnes.\n\n7th July, 1895.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014With reference to the paper recently read before the Society on the subject of the Jain religion, it may be of interest to members to have the following translation of the opening words of the 10th Sutta of the Majjhima Nik\u0101ya:\n\n\"Thus have I heard. Once on a time the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyas in S\u016bmag\u0101ma. Now it was at this time that Niga\u1e47\u1e6dha N\u0101taputta had just died at P\u0101v\u0101. By reason of his death the Niga\u1e47\u1e6dhas were broken up, divided into two camps, filled with dissension and contention, and were always wounding one another with\nbiting words, such as '\u2014'You don\u2019t understand this Doctrine and Rule; I do. How can you understand this Doctrine and Rule? Your conduct is crooked, mine upright. What I say is to the point; what you say is irrelevant. You say last what ought to be said first; and you say first what ought to be said last. I have refuted your theses; your errors are exposed; you are put to shame. Begone and purge yourself of your errors; or defend yourself if you can.' Indeed, the followers of Niga\u1e47\u1e6dha N\u0101taputta appear to have gone to any lengths short of murder. As for those disciples of Niga\u1e47\u1e6dha N\u0101taputta who were of the laity and wore the white robe [of the layman], they, too, were sick and disgusted and in revolt against the following of Niga\u1e47\u1e6dha N\u0101taputta, as with an ill-preached and ill-taught Doctrine and Rule, leading not to salvation, offering no asylum, not proclaimed by a Very Buddha, a broken shrine, in which was no refuge.\"\n\nUnfortunately the Sutta gives no further details; and Buddhaghosa\u2019s commentary is silent on the subject of Niga\u1e47\u1e6dha N\u0101taputta.\u2014Yours faithfully,\n\nROBERT CHALMERS.\n\nTo the Secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\n1 This is a stock passage (occurring e.g. at p. 8 of vol. i of the D\u012bgha Nikaya in the Pali Text Society\u2019s edition), and cannot be regarded as historical here. In the 77th Sutta of the Majjhima Nik\u0101ya, the same words are used by the revolting disciples of P\u016brana Kassapa against their master, who, like Niga\u1e47\u1e6dha N\u0101taputta, was a rival of Gotama.\nNOTES OF THE QUARTER.\n\n(April, May, June, 1895.)\n\nI.

Mr. Hyde Clarke,\n2. Sir W. Mackinnon,\n3. Sir Henry Rawlinson.\n\nOn the other hand, there have been elected the following twenty members:\n\n1. The Rev. W. G. Shellabear,\n2. Miss Kennedy,\n3. Major Livermore,\n4. Mr. C. Otto Blagden,\n5. Mr. Kunwar Kushal Pal Sinha,\n6. Mr. H. Raynbird,\n7. The Rev. J. J. Bambridge,\n8. Mr. G. Phillips,\n9. Mr. Diwan Tek Chand,\n10. Mrs. Bode,\n11. Mr. A.

Peatling,\n20. H.H. the Maharaja of Travancore.\n\nFour libraries have also become subscribing members, so that the total up to date comes to 514, which is the largest number of members and subscribers that the Society has had since its formation.\n\nIt may be well to recall the fact that in the first year of the Society's existence there were 217 paying members. That number gradually dropped, with some spasmodic increases, till in 1874 it had fallen to 153, and in 1876\nto its lowest point, namely 143. It then gradually rose, with slight fluctuations, till in the year under review it was 281, or very nearly double the lowest point of eighteen years ago. To ascertain the full number of members and subscribers it is necessary to add the Honorary Members, the Compounding Members, and the Library Members.\n\nThe number of Honorary Members remained stationary at between thirty and thirty-five for many years, and has now been permanently fixed at thirty, and oddly enough the number of Compounders on our books in any one year has but very slightly varied. They were 111 in the Society's first year, 93 thirty years afterwards, in 1864, and 106 last year, after another lapse of thirty years.\n\nThe permission to become subscribing members was only granted to libraries in 1889. Since then the number of adherents under this head has steadily, if slowly, increased till it stood on the 1st of January at 38, and is now 42. There are also between fifty and sixty other libraries which purchase our Journal through the booksellers without giving us their names. All such sales were, for many years, a perquisite of the publisher, as were also the advertisements. The receipts from these sources appearing this year in the Society's accounts amount to \u00a3181 6s. 1d. The unused copies of the Society's Journal, that is, those not issued to subscribers, were also formerly a perquisite of the publishers. These are now all stored on the Society's premises, and a regular stock-book is kept as a record of the Society's property in this respect.\n\nThe accounts also show an amount of \u00a3400 placed on deposit, and \u00a3200 withdrawn from deposit. The remaining sum of \u00a3200 has been invested in the purchase of \u00a3177 Midland 3 per cent. Debenture Stocks, and a further \u00a350 has been deposited in the Post Office Savings Bank. This brings the capital account of the Society up to \u00a31170. That account stood in 1887 at \u00a31200, but had been reduced chiefly by the very heavy expenditure on repairs, and especially on the roof, rendered necessary at the expiration of the lease of the Society's rooms by the terms of the\nlease. It was very desirable to replace the amount as soon as the Society's finances allowed; and the Council is glad that it has been able to do so, so nearly, during the year 1894. This year the Council have more than made up the full original amount of \u00a31200 by placing another \u00a350 to the credit of the Society's deposit account in the Post Office Savings Bank, so that the total capital account now stands at \u00a31220\u2014and this has been done without withdrawing any sums from the expenditure on the Journal or the Library.\n\nThe printing of the Journal and illustrations cost this year \u00a3324, as against \u00a3318 last year; and the accounts again show a heavy expenditure on the library, not so much, indeed, as last year, but much more than the amounts the Council was able to spend in previous years.\n\nThe following table will show the total amounts spent on the library for the years 1855\u20131894:\n\n| Year | Binding | New Books | Appliances and Catalogue | Total |\n|------|---------|-----------|--------------------------|-------|\n| 1855 | 10 0 0  | 13 0 0    |                          | 23 0 0 |\n| 1856 | None    | None      |                          | None  |\n| 1857 | None    | None      |                          | None  |\n| 1858 | 10 0 0  | 5 0 0     |                          | 15 0 0 |\n| 1859 | None    | None      |                          | None  |\n| 1860 | 10 0 0 (about) | None |                          | 10 0 0 |\n| 1861 | 28 14 7 | None      |                          | 28 14 7 |\n| 1862 | None    | None      |                          | None  |\n| 1863 | None    | None      |                          | None  |\n| 1864 | 15 4 6  | None      |                          | 15 4 6 |\n| 1865 | None    | None      |                          | None  |\n| 1866 | 9 2 6   | None      |                          | 9 2 6 |\n| 1867 | None    | None      |                          | None  |\n| 1868 | .6 16 6 | None      |                          | .6 16 6 |\n| 1869 | 9 8 7   | None      |                          | 9 8 7 |\n| 1870 | 1 11 10 | None      |                          | 1 11 10 |\n| 1871 | 15 7 10 | None      |                          | 15 7 10 |\n| 1872 | 22 3 1  | None      |                          | 22 3 1 |\n| 1873 | 11 18 6 | None      |                          | 11 18 6 |\n| 1874 | None    | None      |                          | None  |\n### NOTES OF THE QUARTER.\n\n| BINDING | NEW BOOKS | APPLIANCES AND CATALOGUE | TOTAL |\n|---------|-----------|--------------------------|-------|\n| \u00a3 s. d. | \u00a3 s. d.   | \u00a3 s. d.                  | \u00a3 s. d. |\n| 1875    | 9 12 2    | None                     | ...   |\n|         |           |                          | 9 12 2 |\n| 1876    | 1 0 6     | 6 8 6                    | ...   |\n|         |           |                          | 7 9 0  |\n| 1877    | 10 2 10   | 9 5 6                    | ...   |\n|         |           |                          | 19 8 2 |\n| 1878    | 5 9 0     | None                     | ...   |\n|         |           |                          | 5 9 0  |\n| 1879    | 12 10 9   | 3 3 0                    | 7 5 0  |\n|         |           |                          | 22 18 9|\n| 1880    | 20 1 11   | 15 15 0                  | ...   |\n|         |           |                          | 35 16 11|\n| 1881    | 67 7 3    | 35 13 3                  | 36 5 0 |\n|         |           |                          | 139 5 6|\n| 1882    | 51 5 11   | 46 15 0                  | ...   |\n|         |           |                          | 98 0 11|\n| 1883    | 28 3 3    | 53 5 6                   | ...   |\n|         |           |                          | 81 8 9 |\n| 1884    | 28 16 3   | 90 18 3                  | ...   |\n|         |           |                          | 119 14 6|\n| 1885    | 8 11 3    | 31 14 0                  | ...   |\n|         |           |                          | 40 5 3 |\n| 1886    | 23 16 11  | 32 6 1                   | ...   |\n|         |           |                          | 56 3 0 |\n| 1887    | 23 6 0    | 16 13 4                  | ...   |\n|         |           |                          | 39 19 4|\n| 1888    | 22 4 9    | 10 0 0                   | ...   |\n|         |           |                          | 32 4 9 |\n| 1889    | 38 12 5   | 8 6 5                    | ...   |\n|         |           |                          | 46 18 10|\n| 1890    | 36 14 6   | 19 18 9                  | 10 0 0 |\n|         |           |                          | 66 13 3|\n| 1891    | 20 13 7   | None                     | 10 0 0 |\n|         |           |                          | 30 13 7|\n| 1892    | 42 6 6    | 14 0 6                   | 12 4 3 |\n|         |           |                          | 68 11 3|\n| 1893    | 53 19 9   | 12 17 8                  | 126 11 1|\n|         |           |                          | 193 8 6|\n| 1894    | 31 13 0   | 17 6 1                   | 68 3 0 |\n|         |           |                          | 117 2 1|\n\nThe Council regrets that the expenditure on this head for this year shows so small an amount for new books. It will be seen that the principal item is on account of the new catalogue. But now that the catalogue has been completely paid for, more funds will be available for new books. The Council hopes to utilize the sum so set free to secure copies of all standard works as they from time to time appear. To fill up the gaps of former years is a more serious task, but part of the money the Council is now able to vote each year can be devoted to this end. The other items of expenditure call for little remark. The Council have thought it expedient to provide new stair carpets, which had not been renewed for many years, and the other items are fixed charges, which vary but little from year to year.

ARRUTHNOT.\nJ. KENNEDY.\nH. THOMSON LYON.\nThe Council has to report that the Oriental Translation Fund, started by Mr. Arbuthnot's generous example, has steadily progressed. Mr. Tawney's translation of the Kath\u0101 Kosa, for which Mr. Arbuthnot has himself provided the funds, has now appeared; and Prof. Thibaut's translation of the Pa\u00f1ca-da\u00e7i, the costs of which are defrayed by an anonymous friend, and Prof. Cowell's translation of the Harsha Carita, towards which Lord Northbrook contributes \u00a3100, and Mr. Boscawen's volume of Assyrian Texts are well in hand.\n\nThe Council has to regret the death of four of their Honorary Members\u2014\n\nProf. Dillmann,\nProf. Whitney,\nBrugsch Pasha, and\nProf. Darmesteter.\n\nIn their place the Council recommends the election of\u2014\n\nProf. Naville,\nM. Barth,\nProf. Tiele,\nProf. F. H. M\u00fcller, and\nProf. Donner.\n\nBy the rules of the Society five gentlemen, of whom two are re-eligible, retire from the Council, that is to say:\n\nBy seniority\u2014\n\nSir Raymond West, K.C.I.E.,\nMr. Delmar Morgan.\n\nBy least attendance\u2014\n\nCol. Plunkett, R.E.\nMr. Chalmers, and\nThe Rev. C. J. Ball, M.A.\nIn their place the Council recommends the election of\u2014\n\nSir Raymond West,\nMr. Delmar Morgan,\nMr. Beveridge,\nMr. Robert Sewell, and\nMr. Henry Morris.\n\nUnder Rule 16 Professor Sayce and Professor Legge retire from the Vice-Presidency. The Council recommends their re-election for another term of three years.\n\nThe Council recommends the election of Sir W. W. Hunter as Vice-President of the Society.\n\nSir Raymond West, K.C.I.E., LL.D., said: My Lord, Ladies and Gentlemen,\u2014I have much pleasure in moving the adoption of a report at once so satisfactory and so businesslike. It must be gratifying to the members of the Society to find that it is in a better position, financially and otherwise, than it has been for many years, and even than it was when it was started, with so great a flourish of trumpets, many years ago. There is one expression, indeed, to which I would take exception, the one which speaks of a large expenditure on the Library. I do not think that the accounts show what I should call a large expenditure on this head, and I trust that the funds of the Society will enable us in future years to increase very considerably the sums we can devote to the Library.\n\nIn looking over our financial position we shall not, I hope, ever overlook the great importance to the Society of a high level of value in the contributions to its Journal. It is only in recent years that the Council have ventured, first to issue a quarterly journal and afterwards to take the whole publishing arrangements into their own hands. Both these steps have been crowned with a large measure of success.\n\nThe very substantial Journal of the year 1894 contains twenty-four longer articles, apart from the shorter notes, reviews, and correspondence. These form, I think, a very\ninteresting and useful portion of our yearly volume, and might even, especially as regards the book notices, be wisely increased. The longer articles are, it is to be hoped, each and all of interest to the students of the particular branch dealt with; but I should wish to direct your attention to some of them that seem to me personally of particular interest. There is the article by Mr. Granville Browne on an old Persian commentary on the Kur\u0101n, which is one of the earliest specimens of Persian prose as yet made known to scholars. Then there is Mr. Robert Chalmers's text and translation of a very early document, probably as old as the fourth century B.C., on Indian Caste; and with this may be mentioned Miss Foley's account of a similar Sutta of like age, illustrating the psychological basis of Buddhist Ethics. Then we have Professor Sayce's article on the very ancient inscriptions from Van, in continuation of a series of similar articles, in which he has laid before the Society all that is known on these the earliest historical documents of the region now often called Armenia. My friend Prof. B\u00fchler and Mr. Rapson have given us articles founded on the remains of a great native scholar\u2014I mean Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l Indraj\u012b, an honorary member of this Society\u2014and dealing with arch\u00e6ological and numismatic questions of great importance for the early history of India. Professor Macdonell, of Oxford, has discussed two ancient Indian legends found in an old MS. of Shadguru\u1e63ishya; and Mr. Waddell has given us no less than four articles dealing with Tibetan Lamaism and Buddhist Arch\u00e6ology. Finally, Mr. Beveridge, for so many years a distinguished member and for some time President of the Bengal Asiatic Society, whose accession to the number of our working members we are glad to welcome, has given us a full account of a hitherto unpublished work, in Persian, on the history of Muhammadan India, entitled the Khal\u0101\u1e63at-at-Taw\u0101r\u012bkh. All these articles are founded on historical material now for the first time made accessible to scholars, and are, therefore, real contributions to existing knowledge, not merely discussions about what is already known. This,\nI venture to think, is precisely the sort of work which we desire to see in our Journal, and it is to my mind not a subject for regret, but the reverse, that so much of the work done has relation to India.\n\nGeneral Pearse, C.B., had much pleasure in seconding the adoption of the Report. He felt that the Council had made the best use possible of the very limited means at the disposal of the Society, and begged to express his entire agreement with the words that had fallen from Sir Raymond West with regard to the articles in the Journal.\n\nThe President, in putting the resolution to the meeting, said: I am glad to be able to express my own thanks, and the thanks of the Society, to the writers of the interesting papers in the Journal, and to those who have at our meetings put before us valuable evidence of their researches in various fields of learning. We can, indeed, congratulate ourselves on the progress the Society is making. But our feelings should not merely be those of self-complacency. Indeed, we should guard against that, and rather compare our position with that of other countries who have such a smaller stake than our own in Oriental matters, but whose activity is so much greater. In that respect the Government will, I hope, take advantage of one opening which lies before it. A bill for the reconstruction of the University of London will very shortly be introduced in the House of Lords. And I have good reason to expect that the new body will be in every respect an Imperial University with an Oriental School not unworthy of our great Empire in the East, so that those Oriental scholars who have hitherto too often worked without suitable reward could receive due recognition for their labours. It is to be regretted that our Governments, both at home and in India\u2014whilst the doctrine that the State, in higher educational matters, should leave everything to private initiative and support, is so universally being discarded\u2014should still so often adhere to it where Oriental learning is concerned. The new University will, I trust, show that this is no longer to be the case, and that the new Oriental School\nattached to it will be a credit to our nation and a centre of original and valuable research. Meanwhile it is a matter of legitimate pride to this Society that it has striven for so many years, and with so great a measure of success, to keep the lamp of Oriental learning alight in England.\n\nThe resolution was then put, and carried unanimously.\n\nDr. Rost, Chairman of the Library Committee, moved that in Rule 67, instead of the words \"The Council may, under special circumstances, suspend the operations of Rules 64 and 65,\" there should be read \"May authorize the Secretary and Librarian to suspend, under special circumstances, the operation of Rules 64 and 65.\"\n\nSir Raymond West seconded the adoption of this slight alteration. It had already received the careful attention of the Library Committee of the Council, and would, no doubt, have the effect of making the Library more useful to the members of the Society.\n\nThe resolution was adopted.\n\nMr. Virchand R. Gandhi read a paper on the \"History and Religion of the Jains.\"\n\nHe said the old error that the Jains were a sect or offshoot of the Buddhists was now universally abandoned by European scholars. The Nigantha Nataputta mentioned in the Pali Pitakas as a contemporary and opponent of the Buddha, who died a few years before him, has been rightly identified with the Mah\u0101v\u012bra Vardham\u0101na, the founder of the Jain community. Their own records showed that he was a Kshatriya of the J\u00f1\u0101tri clan, and J\u00f1\u0101tri would in Pali become N\u0101tha. The word Nigantha, meaning \"free from ties,\" that is, the ties of the world, is an epithet still often applied to the Jain monks. It was true that among the Gacchas, into which the Jain monks were divided, there was one, the Nigantha Gaccha, which ceased to be so called at the ninth in lineal descent from teacher to pupil from Mah\u0101v\u012bra. But the name was only changed from Nigantha to Kotika to celebrate the fact that the chiefs of the Jain community in the ninth Patta (or spiritual generation)\nhad repeated a Koti, that is, ten million times the S\u016brya Mantra, a mystical invocation of the sun called by that name. Thenceforward the Gaccha received the epithet Kotika, but it was none the less also Nigantha. The lecturer then explained the doctrine of non-resistance which has made the Jains so peace-loving and law-abiding a people. He also compared the Jain doctrine of the soul with that of the Vedantists on the one hand and the Buddhists on the other, showing that the Jains, in accordance with their Anekanta V\u0101da, or method of looking at both sides of the question, had always steered a middle course. In conclusion he touched on some points of Jain ethics, especially emphasizing the tone of mercy which pervades their writings, and which was well exemplified by the formula of the Prati Kamana daily repeated, \u201cI forgive all living things; I ask all living things to forgive me.\u201d\u2014The paper was followed by a discussion, in which General Pearse, Mr. H. Baynes, Prof. Bendall, Mr. Raynbird, Dr. Leitner, Mr. Beveridge, and Prof. Rhys Davids took part.\n\n11th June, 1895.\n\nIt was announced that\u2014\n\nMr. St. George Lane-Fox-Pitt,\nMr. Percy M. Sykes, and\nMr. Virchand R. Gandhi\n\nhad been elected members of the Society.\n\nThe Secretary read a paper by Hofrath B\u00fchler, of Vienna, on \u201cPast and Future Archaeological Researches in India.\u201d A discussion followed, in which Dr. Leitner, Mr. R. Sewell, and Mr. W. F. Sinclair took part.\n\nThe paper appears in the present number.\n\nII. Contents of Foreign Oriental Journals.\n\n1.

Obituary Notice.\n\nSir Henry Rawlinson, Bart.\u2014As it is understood that a Biography of our Late Director and ex-President will be shortly published by a most competent authority, this notice will be restricted to the relations of the deceased with this Society, and his linguistic, and arch\u00e6ological, labours. We have, indeed, lost the most illustrious of our members, who has left an imperishable memory in our Journal.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1896.\nThe Council has decided not to fill up the post of Director, occupied in succession by Colebroke, Hayman Wilson, and Rawlinson, till someone worthy to rank with these heroes appears.\n\nSir Henry Rawlinson went out to India round the Cape in 1827, in the same ship with Sir John Malcolm, Governor of Bombay. His first period of employment in Persia was from 1833 to 1839. He was at Cabul, and Candahar in Afghanistan during the first Afghan war, in 1841-1842. He was at Calcutta in the Autumn of 1843, and proceeded thence to his new appointment of Political Agent at Baghdad, in Turkish Arabia. We published his account of the Inscriptions of Behistun in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society in 1846, before he became a member of the Society.\n\nHe was elected a Member of this Society in 1847, and Director in 1862, which office he held by annual re-election, up to the date of his death, for 33 years. He was President of the Society from 1878 to May, 1881. He contributed to the Journal eight papers of first-rate importance; but they are but a small portion of his literary achievements, as a year and a half before his death he forwarded to me a copy of a catalogue of his writings prepared by Professor Paul Haupt, and printed in the United States, comprising 131 separate items; and in his letter to my address dated Sept. 6th, 1893, he points out, that two important papers have been omitted from that Catalogue. Few have left such a roll of continuous literary activity.\n\nIt must be recollected, that he was not a secluded Student, or the Professor of a University, or one, who closed an active career in learned labour: from the date of his landing in India to the day of his death, a period of sixty-eight years, he was in active service, as a soldier of the Indian Army, an organizer of new armies in Persia, a fighting member of a successful garrison at Candahar in Afghanistan, a Political Agent, Consul-General, and Minister Plenipotentiary, in the Empire of Turkey and Kingdom of Persia, a Member of Parliament, a Member of the Council\nof India, President, Councillor, and Member of Learned Societies, Trustee of the British Museum; in the year 1839, while the writer of this Notice was Captain of Eton College, he had obtained the medal of the Geographical Society; he was a constant writer and speaker almost to his last years. He was Interpreter of his Regiment in Bombay at the age of nineteen, and when he was of the age of 83 the writer of this Notice felt honoured in being permitted to listen to his remarks on linguistic subjects, and to look over the pile of Manuscript notebooks, which he had accumulated from year to year, for he had the wisdom to record at once scraps of knowledge, which he gathered orally, to note the references to passages of printed volumes, when he came upon something worth referring to hereafter, and still more to record the points, on which he required more light. It is only by keeping such notebooks for \"Notanda, Legenda, Qu\u00e6renda\" that in this busy Epoch an all-round knowledge can be maintained, and our deceased friend was essentially a thoughtful man, one ready to impart from his fulness to others: it must have been a strain to him to keep abreast with the ever-advancing tide of expanding knowledge of his favourite subjects, and it is not to be wondered at, that an octogenarian man did not succeed in achieving a task, to which a man in his prime, betwixt the age of 45 and 65, does not always succeed.\n\nIn the Meetings between 1860 and 1880 scarcely one took place without the President asking Sir Henry Rawlinson to make a communication on the subject of Cuneiform Research, or, if Sir Henry were himself President, his undertaking to communicate the last discovery: those were days, when we were contented with the drops of the coming shower; we have the whole subject now at our disposal. It may be confidently asserted, that in the History of the World no greater and more unexpected revelation was made of buried and forgotten literary knowledge, than that of the Inscriptions of Persia and Mesopotamia, and Sir Henry Rawlinson was the leader of that great movement; he set the ball rolling.\nGrotefend had indeed been the advance-guard: he died in 1853. Professor Burnouf died in 1852 at the age of only 51: if he had lived longer, the world would have been wiser. Their material was restricted to Persepolis, but Burnouf's knowledge of Asiatic languages enabled him to leave hints, which have been valuable for those, who came after him: he did not live long enough to see the full glories of the Tablets at Behistun, copied by Sir H. Rawlinson, consisting of Inscriptions in three languages, Persian, Assyrian, and Median, unfolded. Professor Lassen died in 1876: he had published at Bonn, in Germany, in 1836, his Essay \"Die alt-persischen Keil-Inchriften\" one month earlier than his friend Burnouf's \"Memoire sur deux Inscriptions Cuneiformes\" in Paris. They were both Scholars of the highest eminence, and the Memoir by Sir Henry Rawlinson on the great Inscriptions of Behistun was not received by our Society till 1839, but the whole of it had been drawn up by the Soldier-Political in his isolated residence at Kermanshah, on the frontier of Persia, in ignorance of what had been done in the way of Cuneiform interpretation two years previously in Europe. Sir Henry was not a Scholar of the type of the French and German University Scholars: he was a traveller, explorer, decipherer, and by the aid of his own genius an independent interpreter: he told me once, that it was his familiarity with some of the rural dialects of Persia, that enabled him to grapple with the Old-Persian of the time of Darius.\n\nI find in my Journals of 1843, that on the 26th of September of that year I was invited at Calcutta by Mr. Thomason, Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, to meet Major Rawlinson on his road to Baghdad to take up his office of Political Agent in Turkish Arabia: I remember his conversation, as he asked me, then studying Sanskrit in the College of Fort William, several intricate questions on Sanskrit Grammar, explaining that he was going to try to interpret some Old-Persian Inscriptions at Behistun. So entirely was he in\nadvance of his Epoch, that neither I, nor any of the company, understood what he was after, and it was not till several years had passed away, and the troubles of the Sikh and Panjab wars of 1845-46 and 1849 were over, and peace had been restored to my Province, that I understood, what was meant by Major Rawlinson's plan of copying and translating Old-Persian Inscriptions, and the word Cuneiform first became to me an object of interest, which it has never ceased to be for more than forty years. All the romance of these discoveries has become mere History now to the younger generation, but the secret, concealed so many years, was unrolled before the very eyes of the few older survivors of the old generation: the world knows the secret now, which the Greek and Roman never knew.\n\nArtem, quae latuit Graecos, latuitque Latinos,\nNostrorum sollers extulit ingenium.\n\nThree other honoured names connect themselves with that of Sir Henry Rawlinson; the bearers of those names are all dead, and their obituary notices appear in the Journal of our Society: Edwin Norris, for thirty-five years Assistant-Honorary Secretary and Honorary Librarian of this Society: he carried through the Press the important Memoirs of the absent discoverer and decipherer, and became one of the chief authorities in Cuneiform Philology; he died in 1872, having translated the third, or Median, Tablet of Behistun. Dr. Hincks, an Irish Clergyman, exhibited a wonderful aptitude for decipherment, and materially assisted the progress of the discovery by his contributions to our Journal: he died in 1866. Mr. Henry Talbot, a private gentleman, greatly advanced the study by a series of papers in this Journal, and died in 1877.\n\nIt is to a certain extent a misfortune to live too long after having made in early life a great discovery; for knowledge advances, and leaves the original discoverer far\nin the rear. At the Meeting of this Society on the 12th of March, our present President, Lord Reay, drew attention to the great loss, which we had suffered: \"It was impossible,\" he said, \"to exaggerate the importance for the history of the development of Oriental ideas and institutions, of the magnificent work of the decipherment of the tablet at Behistun, and it was a matter of pride to the Society, that the results of his remarkable discoveries were given to the world through the medium of the Society's Journal.\"\n\nThe President of the Royal Geographical Society, at a Meeting of that Society on the previous day, had expressed his regret at the loss of that Society also, mentioning that Sir Henry Rawlinson had received the gold medal fifty-five years before, and had been a Fellow more than fifty years. He had filled the post of President of both Societies: we had no medal to grant him, or we should certainly have given it to him. Sir Frederick Goldsmid has inserted an obituary notice in the April number of the Geographical Journal, detailing the Services, which the deceased had rendered to Geography. In Germany, Sir Henry Rawlinson's claims to be regarded as the first decipherer of the Cuneiform have always been allowed without hesitation, notwithstanding the labours of Lassen and others in the same field. My friend Henri Cordier, Professor of Chinese at Paris, and a Honorary Member of our Society, has forwarded to me a printed copy of the tribute paid by him at a Meeting of La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Geographie at Paris, and he quotes the opinion of Professor Jules Oppert, of the College of France, extremely laudatory of the services of Sir Henry, of which I quote the concluding lines: \"Les jeunes allemands, et anglais, feignent de ne pas le con- naitre: un anglais me disait m\u00eame, qu'il n'avait jamais lu une ligne de Sir Henry Rawlinson. Je lui repondis: 'I supposed just so; because if you had read them, your papers would be less imperfect than they are.'\"\n\nSir Henry was one of the two colleagues of his brother, the Rev. G. Rawlinson, Canon of Canterbury, in his Edition\nof the History of Herodotus, published in 1858: the Author in his Preface says, that \"Sir Henry exercised a general supervision over the Oriental portion of the work, and lent his aid throughout to all that concerned the Geography, Ethnology, and History, of the Eastern Nations: without this assistance the Author would not have undertaken the work.\"\n\nSir Henry Rawlinson was a knight of the Prussian Order of Merit; associate member of the Academy at Paris; member of the Academy at Munich; Hon. D.C.L. Oxford; Hon. LL.D. Cambridge and Edinburgh; D.L. of London; he received the Grand Cross of the Bath about five years, and he was made a Baronet about three years, before his death. He well deserved every honour that he obtained, but his case is but another illustration of the neglect shown by the British Government to literary merits, upon which I commented in the obituary of another great veteran Scholar of the same Epoch, Brian Hodgson. Sir Henry Rawlinson's career in India did not exceed five years as a Regimental Officer: when he left India for Persia in 1832 he never returned to work in that country, though in 1843 he passed through Northern India on his way to take up his new employment in Turkish Arabia: the honours, which he received from the State, were in return for his great political services in Central Asia, and administrative services in Great Britain; had he never unveiled the secret of the Cuneiform Script, he would have received, and deservedly received, the same honours. Brian Hodgson did a work as great for the languages of India, and the Buddhist Religion, and received nothing from his country, though France was not behindhand in conferring honours on him also; and the Asiatic Society can truly say, that it is not likely ever to have on its lists men who are as illustrious, nor could it wish to have men more illustrious, than these two departed worthies: their portraits adorn the walls of the rooms of the Society, and remind a younger generation of what Genius and Industry can achieve.\n\nThe following is a list of Sir Henry's contributions to\nour Journal: they are no ordinary papers: some oral remarks are added:\n\n| Year | Vol. | Page | Description |\n|------|------|------|-------------|\n| 1846 | IX   | v    | The discoveries of Major Rawlinson are announced to the Society. |\n|      | X    | \u2014    | Persian Cuneiform Inscriptions at Behistun deciphered and translated, with a memoir on Cuneiform in general: the whole volume of 370 pages. |\n| 1850 | XI   | \u2014    | An appendix to the foregoing, consisting of 192 pages. |\n|      | XII  | 401  | On the Inscriptions of Assyria and Babylonia, 82 pages. |\n| 1853 | XIV  | \u2014    | Babylonian Cuneiform Inscriptions at Behistun: the whole volume 160 pages. |\n| 1855 | XV   | 215  | Notes on early history of Babylonia, 40 pages. |\n|      |      | 398  | On the orthography of Royal Names of Assyrian and Babylonian history, 4 pages. |\n| 1861 | XVIII| 1    | On the Birs Nimrud Inscription, 34 pages. |\n|      |      | 150  | Comparative translation of Inscription of Tiglath Pileser with three other Scholars, 70 pages. |\n| 1865 | I    | 187  | Bilingual readings, Cuneiform and Phenician: notes on tablets in the British Museum containing bilingual legends, Assyrian and Phenician, 60 pages. |\n| 1867 | III  | 296  | Note on Pai Kuli. |\n| 1873 | IX   | xlviii | Points out the value of George Smith's recent researches. |\n| 1875 | XI   | 21   | On the prevalence of the Scythic element in Media. |\n| 1876 | XII  | 70   | Note on a newly-discovered clay cylinder of Cyrus the Great. |\n| 1877 | XIII | 41   | Statement with regard to recent researches of Mr. Rassam. |\n| 1879 | XV   | 371  | Identification of the term Sapta Sindhu as meaning the seven head streams of the Orus. |\n\nTo this enumeration must be added the reports on progress of Cuneiform interpretation made at our Meetings as above described. I think that it is creditable to those,\nwho at that time had the control of our Journal, that they spared no expense to carry out Sir Henry's wishes, and, indeed, sometimes volumes of the Journal fell into arrears from the delay arising in getting the material ready for the Press, or in completing an essay, a portion of which was already in type.\n\nIn the year 1873 the Royal Asiatic Society kept its first half-century Jubilee, and in the Calcutta Review of that year I described at length the work, which it had accomplished, and I venture to quote the following lines written twenty-two years ago:\n\n\"In the year 1844 Sir H. Rawlinson had made copies of the Cuneiform Inscriptions of Persepolis, and had solved the great problem, giving new life to the decrees of King Darius after a slumber of more than 2000 years. The Asiatic Society lent its countenance and influence, and opened its purse liberally, to the support of this great discovery: the Journals of the Society suddenly acquired a new interest, which was increased a hundredfold, when Nineveh and Babylon disclosed their long-buried treasures, the literature, language, and history of a period separated from the present era by twenty-five centuries: it was then (1849) that the Society became the centre of a great literary movement, and their publications were subsidized by a National grant; it was then that the greatest and most eminent men, headed by the Prince Consort, attended at our Meetings, and tourists abroad found that a copy of the Journal, unfolding the wonderful Cuneiform discoveries, was the most acceptable present in the scientific world at foreign Capitals. In heading this movement the Society acted as if by inspiration, as there was for a long time a great wave of incredulity to resist, and Sir Henry Rawlinson has always gratefully acknowledged the debt, which he owed to his earliest supporters, and styled himself their alumnus.\"\n\nAnother characteristic of our departed friend was that, like M. Waddington of Paris, and Baron Kremer of Vienna, he attracted to the study of Oriental Languages and\nArch\u00e6ology a fashion and popularity: he was at home in the Camp, the Court, the Council Chamber, and the Senate, as well as in the Public Library, the British Museum, and amidst his books and notes in his own study. I have during the last twenty years attended the International Oriental Congresses at all the Capitals of Europe, and have thus made the acquaintance of nearly every Oriental Scholar in Europe: some of them were learned men indeed, but quaint in appearance, and in mode of utterance as narrow-minded and limited in their range of knowledge as specialists only can be: it was difficult for an experienced brain-picker to extract anything out of some, who were mere professorial recluses in spectacles; but in conversation Sir Henry Rawlinson, when he found himself amidst kindred spirits, passed readily, and gaily, and instructively, from a discussion on the policy of the Shah of Persia, or the Amir of Afghanistan, or from some geographical detail regarding the region of the River Oxus, to the intricacy of the translation of a Cuneiform word or sentence, whether Semitic, or Old-Persian, or Akkadian, or the probable date and affinity of a new variety of Alphabetic Script lately discovered in Arabia. This was a great and special gift almost peculiar to himself, which rendered his society so delightful and profitable. In looking round the circle of my daily diminishing contemporaries, or of my senior fellow-labourers, I know of no one like unto him: it is an honour, a profit, and a joy, to have known him: each right-minded student pays a lasting homage to the storehouse, from which, either through the channel of word of mouth, or of printed page, he has derived valuable contributions to his own ever-increasing stock of knowledge.\n\nMay 25th, 1895.\n\nRobert Cust,\nHon. Sec. of Royal Asiatic Society.\nIV. Notes and News.\n\nA new Edict of Asoka.\u2014Hofrath B\u00fchler, in The Academy for May 28th, 1894, gives an account of the discovery, by Dr. A. F\u00fchrer, near the Nepalese village of Nigliva (thirty-seven miles north-west of Uska, on the North Bengal Railway), of a new pillar edict of Asoka. The pillar is broken, the inscription is on the lower half, and several lines are buried. These latter can only be read after permission, which has been applied for, has been obtained from the Nepalese Government to excavate. But the lines above ground are sufficient to show how important and interesting this new find is. The readable portion says: \"When the god-beloved king Piyadassi had been anointed fourteen years he increased the st\u016bpa of Ko\u1e47\u0101gamana for the second time, and when he had been anointed . . . . years he himself came and worshipped it.\"\n\nThe earliest mention of Ko\u1e47\u0101gamana (as he is called in P\u0101li) in printed texts is in the Buddha Vansa (one of the latest books included in the Pi\u1e6dakas), where an account of him as the twenty-third Buddha is given in full. But the seven last Buddhas, of whom he is one, are known to be referred to in inedited portions of the older books, such as the D\u012bgha and Majjhima. According to the Buddha Vansa, he was born at Sobhavat\u012b and died in the Pabbata \u0100ra\u1e47a, that is, in the Mountain Pleasaunce, which suggests to Hofrath B\u00fchler the conjecture that we have to look near the site of the newly discovered pillar for the traditional place of his death.\n\nYuan Thsang tells us how the relics of Kassapa, the twenty-fourth Buddha, were still preserved in his time near S\u0101vatthi, under a st\u016bpa said to have been built by Asoka; and also of a vih\u0101ra near the Bo Tree, containing Kassapa's image, and a cankama, where he was supposed to have walked up and down in meditation. But this edict is probably the earliest arch\u00e6ological confirmation we have of the actual preservation, in early Buddhist times, of the\nmemory of Ko\u1e47\u0101gamana. The only other evidence of a similar kind is the bas-relief of Ko\u1e47\u0101gamana's Bo Tree figured at pl. xxix of Cunningham's Bharhut Tope. The name in the legend there is spelt with the \\( g \\), not with the \\( k \\).\n\nMr. S. Arthur Strong, of St. John's College, Cambridge, has been elected to the Chair of Arabic at University College, London, which was vacated by Prof. Rieu's transfer to Cambridge. This appointment will not interfere with Mr. Strong's performance of the duties of librarian to the Duke of Devonshire at Chatsworth. At the same time the Rev. Dr. Robert Bruce was elected to the Chair of Persian, which was also held by Prof. Rieu.\n\nV. Notices of Books.\n\nCh\u016bl\u0101 Kanta Mangala: the Tonsure Ceremony as Performed in Siam. By G. E. Gerini. Large 8vo, pp. 186. Bangkok, 1893.\n\nThough dated in 1893, this book by Captain Gerini, of the Royal Military College, Bangkok, has only appeared in 1895. It gives first a slight and not very reliable account of tonsure ceremonies throughout the world, and more especially in India and in Siam. Then, in seven consecutive sections, we have a very detailed and fully illustrated description of the tonsure ceremony as performed now-a-days in Siam, distinguishing throughout the ceremonies observed in the case of boys and girls, and in the case of ordinary people and children of the royal house. The ceremony as performed for Prince Vajr\u0101vudha, the late Crown Prince of Siam, is detailed at length. There are thirteen full-page illustrations from photographs, and a number of woodcuts. It is curious to observe how the ceremony, which is not a Buddhist one and is not observed in other Buddhist countries, has been adopted and modified in accordance with Buddhist beliefs. The adoption of this\nritual in Siam seems to be of late date, as the author cannot find any mention of it earlier than 1640 A.D. It was very probably borrowed from similar customs in India. Though the historical portions of the book, in which the Indian origin is taken for granted, is very weak, the volume is valuable as a detailed and evidently reliable description of a curious ceremony as now practised in Siam.\n\n**Early History of the Dekkan down to the Mahomedan Conquest.** By Ramkrishna Gopal Bhandarkar. 2nd ed. Bombay Gov. Cent. Press, 1895.\n\nIn minor details Dr. Bhandarkar has added to his new edition of the *History of the Dekkan*; but the book is, in the main, little more than a reprint of his earlier work. Since the publication of the latter in 1884, research has, in fact, thrown little new light on the history of the dynasties with which it is concerned, and such fresh evidence as has since appeared seems to have strengthened rather than weakened Dr. Bhandarkar's belief in the conclusions formed by him at an earlier period on various historical and chronological questions.\n\nWith regard to the Andhras, he has seen no reason to change his earlier views, which, it may be added, differ materially from those of other scholars. A considerable number of historical and chronological data as to the later princes of the dynasty has lately accumulated; but the rashness of basing conclusions on these, while scholars are so divided in their interpretation of them, is exemplified in the present work. There is scarcely a point in connection with the Andhras upon which Dr. Bhandarkar does not differ from his colleagues, not only as to the interpretation of the data, but with regard to the conclusions to be drawn from them.\n\nFor some time past the date of Gotamiputra I. has been considered to be fixed within very narrow limits by the synchronism connecting him with Nahap\u0101\u1e47a. Two of the\nN\u0101sik inscriptions have been attributed to Gotam\u012bputra, dated in the fourteenth and twenty-fourth years respectively. Scholars have taken these dates to refer to his own reign, and as the inscription of the fourteenth year is dated from the victorious camp at Govardhana, and records a grant of lands previously held by Nahap\u0101na, and as Nahap\u0101na's latest known date is \u015a. 46, i.e. A.D. 124, the inference has been drawn that Gotamiputra's initial date must fall somewhere about A.D. 113. Dr. Bhandarkar, however, takes an entirely different view of these inscriptions. The year 14 he evidently reads as the year 18, and he refers both it and that of the year 24 to the reign of Pu\u1e37um\u0101yi, arguing that Gotamiputra and Pu\u1e37um\u0101yi ruled contemporaneously, the first at Dhanaka\u1e6daka, the second at N\u0101sik. He finds a support for this hypothesis in the inscription at N\u0101sik, dated in the nineteenth year of Pu\u1e37um\u0101yi, in which Gotam\u012b, the donor of the cave, is called the mother and grandmother of a great king, and Gotamiputra's exploits are enumerated in a way which suggests his being still alive at the time.\n\nWith regard to Chaturapana, M\u0101\u1e0dhar\u012bputra, and Yaj\u00f1\u0101\u015br\u012b, Dr. Bhandarkar likewise holds different views to those of other scholars. Pandit Bhagw\u0101nl\u0101l supposed Chaturapana, from his bearing the name of V\u0101sish\u1e6diputra, to be a brother and successor of Pu\u1e37um\u0101yi, and he thought to have proved from one of his coins that he was the father of Yaj\u00f1\u0101\u015br\u012b Gotamiputra II. Dr. Bhandarkar's reading of the coin in question, however, exactly reverses the Pandit's conclusion, and makes Yaj\u00f1\u0101\u015br\u012b the father of Chaturapana.\n\nM\u0101\u1e0dhar\u012bputra's exact relation to the other Andhras has never been satisfactorily determined, but Dr. Bhagw\u0101nl\u0101l claimed to have established his position between Pu\u1e37um\u0101yi and Gotamiputra II. on the evidence of the Kolh\u0101pur coins. The grounds on which he based his argument were, first, the workmanship of the coins; and second, the fact that M\u0101\u1e0dhar\u012bputra re-struck coins of Pu\u1e37um\u0101yi, and that coins of his own were in turn re-struck by Gotamiputra. The re-striking by Gotamiputra of M\u0101\u1e0dhar\u012bputra's coin is denied\nby Dr. Bhandarkar, who considers the re-striker to be M\u0101dhar\u012bputra, and the coin in question originally one of Gotam\u012bputra's. At the same time he brings forward a piece of evidence in support of his view of which P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dit Bhagw\u0101nl\u0101l was unable to make use. The coins of V\u0101sish\u1e6d\u012bputra (Pu\u1e37um\u0101yi) and Gotam\u012bputra bear the legend Vi\u015bv\u0101yakura, those of M\u0101dhar\u012bputra that of Sevalakura, which Dr. Bhagw\u0101nl\u0101l was unable to interpret. Some time ago Dr. Bhandarkar broached the theory that these were the names of the viceroys appointed by the Andhras to rule that part of the country, the coins in question being issued in their names, and this supposition was made almost a certainty by the identification of Vi\u015bv\u0101yakura with the Baleokuros, governor of Hippokura, mentioned by Ptolemy as contemporary with Pu\u1e37um\u0101yi. This theory the Professor still holds, and it incidentally confirms his view as to M\u0101dhar\u012bputra's position in the list of the Andhra kings; for, as V\u0101sish\u1e6d\u012bputra and Gotam\u012bputra have the same viceroy, the inference is that they succeeded each other; while M\u0101dhar\u012bputra, having a different one, may have preceded or succeeded them, but could not have come between them.\n\nOn various other points connected with the Andhras Dr. Bhandarkar maintains his old views. He is inclined to give its full weight, for chronological purposes, to Ptolemy's mention of Chashtana and Pu\u1e37um\u0101yi, and disposes pretty successfully of the objection raised against it by other scholars. With regard to the disputed passage about the S\u0101takar\u1e47i King in Rudrad\u0101man's inscription, Professor Bhandarkar has modified his earlier translation; though it is evident that he still differs from Dr. B\u00fchler as to the exact interpretation to be put upon the words in question, and is not, apparently, inclined to follow that scholar in the deductions he draws from it in connection with the Kanheri Cave inscription of the Queen of V\u0101sish\u1e6d\u012bputra S\u0101takar\u1e47i (see Ind. Ant., xii. 272 ff.).\n\nIt is open to question whether the date for the rise of the Andhra dynasty yielded by manipulation of the Pauranic records, is so reliable as Dr. Bhandarkar seems to think.\nThe N\u0101n\u0101gha\u1e6d inscription of Simuka, who has been identified with the Pauranic founder of the dynasty, belongs, according to Dr. B\u00fchler, to the period B.C. 200\u2013150, a date which the resemblance of the N\u0101n\u0101gha\u1e6d characters to those of the H\u0101thigumpta inscription (Maurya era 165, i.e. B.C. 150) goes far to confirm; while the date derived by Dr. Bhandarkar from the Pur\u0101\u1e47as is B.C. 73.\n\nIt is true that the agreement of the various Pur\u0101\u1e47as as to the number of years occupied by the Maurya and \u015au\u1e45ga dynasties gives a certain plausibility to conclusions based on these, but Pauranic chronology must always be used cautiously. On the other hand palaeographic evidence, if unsupported by any other, can never be more than an approximate guide for chronological purposes, as the development of alphabets is probably not everywhere a uniform process, but liable to be modified by accidental and local influences for which it is not always easy to account. It may be well, before committing ourselves to either date, to await some fresh light on the subject.\n\nWith the Ch\u0101lukyas we touch firmer chronological ground, and, as the main lines of their history are well established, but little addition of new material is to be expected in the present work.\n\nWith regard to Ma\u1e45gali\u015ba it is to be noted that the Professor differs from Mr. Fleet in his reading of the Mah\u0101k\u016b\u1e6da pillar inscription, which, according to the latter, is dated in the fifth year of Ma\u1e45gali\u015ba, the Siddh\u0101rtha Samvatsara full-moon tithi of Vai\u015b\u0101kha (Ind. Ant., xix. 7), corresponding to the 12th April, 602, thus fixing Ma\u1e45gali\u015ba\u2019s initial date in A.D. 597 or 598. Dr. Bhandarkar adheres to his original date of A.D. 591, being that furnished by Indravarman\u2019s Goa grant of \u015a. 532, issued in the twentieth year of the reign, which reign Dr. Bhandarkar takes to be Ma\u1e45gali\u015ba\u2019s, while Mr. Fleet regards it as Indravarman\u2019s (see Ind. Ant., xix. 11). The Professor discusses the question in a footnote, and gives his reasons for differing from Mr. Fleet.\n\nConsiderable doubt still exists amongst scholars as to the\nCh\u0101lukya rulers of Gujar\u0101t. Dr. B\u00fchler (Ind. Ant., xvii. 199) recognized two Gujar\u0101t branches of the dynasty. Mr. Fleet, whose list in the third volume of the Epigraphia Indica is the latest, gives three branches; but the grant of Vijayar\u0101ja, from which he derives his first branch, is considered spurious by Dr. Bhandarkar, who, even if he were to admit its genuineness, would be inclined to identify the \"Jayasimha\" mentioned in it with the brother of Vikram\u0101ditya I. rather than to regard him as an earlier prince of the same name, as does Mr. Fleet. The date \u015a\u0101\u1e41. 394 he would refer to the Gupta rather than the Chedi era, as has hitherto been done.\n\nIn his account of the R\u0101shtrak\u016b\u1e6das the author has incorporated some facts which have come to light since he wrote his earlier work. The date of \u015a. 705 furnished by the Harivamsa Pur\u0101\u1e47a for Govinda II., and already mentioned in the appendix to the earlier edition, is worth noting. Mr. Fleet seems to have overlooked it in his latest list of the R\u0101shtrak\u016b\u1e6das (Epig. Ind., iii. 54), or, what is more likely, has referred it to Govinda III. since it exactly corresponds to A.D. 782, the first date given by him to that monarch. Dr. Bhandarkar quotes some interesting notices from Jaina works about the first Amoghavareha, showing that he patronised the Jaina creed, if he did not actually hold it himself. The Digambara Jainas attribute to him the authorship of the Prabnottara Ratnam\u0101lik\u0101, and a stanza at the end of their copies of it says he composed it after he had abdicated the throne \"in consequence of the growth of the ascetic spirit within him.\" This statement throws light on a chronological difficulty hitherto unexplained. A Kanheri inscription of \u015a. 799 mentions Amoghavarsha as king, while another at Saundatti of \u015a. 797 names his son K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a as reigning. If Amoghavarsha really abdicated his throne, this discrepancy may easily be accounted for.\n\nAs regards the rest of the R\u0101shtrak\u016b\u1e6da dynasty, the conclusions already arrived at by the Professor in his first edition of the work, and verified by the evidence of the\nWardha grant (J.B.R.A.S., xviii. 239 ff.), have required no modification. Mr. Fleet, who formerly differed from him as to various points in the genealogy of the dynasty, has, to judge from his latest table of it (Epig. Ind., iii. 54), accepted, in almost every case, Dr. Bhandarkar's views.\n\nIn the case of the later Ch\u0101lukyas, the Kalachuris, and the \u015ailah\u0101ras, there has been no material addition lately to the historical facts already known about them. The Samgamner plate of Bh\u012bllama II. and the Kalas Budruk grant of Bh\u012bllama III. have enabled the author to throw light on some doubtful points in the earlier chronology and genealogy of the Y\u0101davas of Devagiri, while Jahlan's S\u016bktimukt\u0101vali has yielded some information about the later Y\u0101davas. Dr. Bhandarkar, like Dr. Hultzsch, seeks to establish a synchronism between the Y\u0101dava Jaitugi I. and the K\u0101kat\u012bya Ga\u1e47apati of the Ek\u0101mran\u0101tha inscription of \u015a. 1172; but, as I have pointed out in the Ind. Ant., xxii. 326, these kings can only be made contemporary by the assumption that Ga\u1e47apati reigned forty or fifty years, for which assumption there seems little justification, and still less, if any reliance is placed on the evidence afforded by contemporary literature for the K\u0101kat\u012bya dynasty.\n\nAmongst other points of interest in the new work are the Professor's adherence to his old views regarding the dates of P\u0101\u1e47ini and Pata\u00f1jali, and his rejection of the theory that Kanishka was the founder of the \u015aaka era. As to Pata\u00f1jali's date probably few scholars now differ from him, but it is doubtful whether his relegation of P\u0101\u1e47ini to the seventh century B.C. will find the same support. With regard to Kanishka, the Professor seems to lay rather too much stress on the difficulties in the way of identifying him with the founder of the \u015aaka era. The era began, we know, in A.D. 78, and all evidence hitherto available points to Kanishka's having ruled about that period. He is known, not only from coins and inscriptions, but from contemporary notices, as a very powerful ruler with a widely extended dominion. He was, moreover, a \u015aaka, and, so far as we know, there was no other king of\nthat period likely to have started the era. Consequently, though direct proof is wanting, probability is strongly in favour of the theory that the era was inaugurated at his coronation.\n\nIndian chronology is like a gigantic and incomplete puzzle, the pieces of which tax all one's ingenuity to put together. A great portion of it is still in almost hopeless confusion, but here and there gaps are gradually being filled up. A book like the present is a striking example of the amount of information which patient research has gleaned from the materials at its disposal, and, coming as it does from the pen of one who has rendered such brilliant services to the cause, it inspires the hope that more of the missing pieces may yet be found to complete the picture which scholars are so laboriously putting together, and that the method which has been so effective in elucidating the early history of the Dekkan may be applied with equal success to other obscure regions of Indian history.\n\nC. M. Duff.\n\nThe J\u0101taka, or Stories of the Buddha's Former Births. Vol. I. Translated by Robert Chalmers, B.A. Cambridge: University Press, 1895.\n\nThis beautifully printed volume is the first instalment of the promised translation of the J\u0101taka, under the superintendence of the veteran Professor Cowell, who has contributed an interesting preface. Out of the 550 stories constituting the whole work, the present issue contains 150. This corresponds to the number in the first volume of Faub\u00f6ll's edition. Forty of these had been already translated by Prof. Rhys Davids, fifteen years ago, who had also rendered the precious introduction, the Nid\u0101nakath\u0101, in which the life-story of Gotama up to the attainment of Buddhahood was related. The plan of the new enterprise has not included this; and it has also dropped the P\u0101li commentary on the G\u0101th\u0101s which\naccompanies Fausb\u00f6ll's text. These omissions are not of any great consequence. English readers can still resort to Prof. David's version of the legendary biography; and professed students of the G\u0101th\u0101s cannot dispense with the original.\n\nThe interest of these stories is, of course, manifold. The enquirer into social history sees here an unrivalled picture of ancient Indian life. Kings and courtiers, Brahmans and ascetics, merchants, huntmen, peasants, slaves, pass swiftly across the scene. The robber is never far off, and constant brigandage introduces an element of violence like that of medi\u00e6val Europe. Behind the ever-moving human groups are the fairies and ogres haunting forest and pool, and the delightful animals whose wisdom or folly is alternately employed for the instruction of man\u2014the monkeys who, having only a limited quantity of water with which to water some young trees, pull them up by their roots that they may adjust the supply to their various sizes; the crows who try to bale out the sea by their bills to rescue one of their number swept away by a wave. The student of folklore finds here the earliest great collection of the materials of his science, for whatever superior antiquity may be claimed for the novels of the Nile, they cannot rival these stories in abundance or variety. To some of the tales here translated Mr. Chalmers has affixed notes on the traces of their subsequent wanderings; he might have noted in the situation of Prince Five-Weapons caught by the hairy ogre (p. 138) the curious analogy with the Tar-baby of Uncle Remus.\n\nBut the stories will probably prove most suggestive to the student of Buddhism. Many of them are, of course, wholly independent, but they illustrate the general atmosphere of thought and feeling in which Buddhism arose. Others are probably the more direct product of the stress which it laid on particular virtues or sins. The story of the Brahman ascetic who provided a water-trough for thirsty animals in a great drought (p. 274), has more than one moral in close harmony with Buddhist ethics. Some\nhave the air of being little moral apalogues counteract the dangers of lust (Professor Cowell marked on the low opinion of women, p. x), or the surrender of that strenuous moral effort Buddhist discipline so continuously demanded. of the stories from this point of view may highlight on the genesis of the introductions, design each tale with some incident in the Buddha's Cowell expresses the opinion that these are \"invention of a later age, like the legendary hi early centuries of ancient Rome.\" The comp a little far-fetched. In some cases passages from the older texts, just as the editors of placed references to the biography of David be Davidic Psalms. In other cases the parallel inc introductions are no doubt deliberately devise series of which Devadatta is the arch-villain, are some which are so thoroughly imbued wi of Buddhism that they may at least represent of a period when its moral impulse was still are those in which the Buddha ate a poor mai (p. 252); or fed five hundred brethren at or slender meal prepared by a rich but ava treasurer and his wife (p. 197); or gave brother overburdened with the detail of the thi the simple rule \"do no evil, whether in word or act\" (p. 140. Why has Mr. Chalmers alter order, which gives a far better sequence\u2014\"in in word, or in thought\"?); or that in which t ness of the Buddha over his disciples is a portrayed (p. 314). The sixteen dreams of Kosala (p. 187 ff.) are interesting samples of of the future decay and corruption of so probably belong to some sort of Indian each may have arisen out of hints of decline analo uttered by the Buddha in the Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Enough has perhaps been said to show the varied interest of this volume. Mr. Chalmers\nseems, on the whole, remarkably successful. His command of language is admirable; his perception of humour is quick; and his idiomatic equivalents are often exceedingly felicitous\u2014one can hardly open a page without lighting on them, e.g. \"A name only serves to mark who's who\" (p. 238, n\u0101mam ndma pa\u1e47\u1e6dattimattam). At times the appropriate limits of paraphrase seem to be transgressed in the employment of alien terms of Western theology, as where the phrase \"to deny the saving grace of my doctrine\" replaces a repetition of the more cumbrous denial \"that my doctrine leads to the destruction of sorrow in him who follows it\" (p. 229). The devotional idioms of Buddhism and Christianity are quite different, and had better be kept apart. But Mr. Chalmers has set a high standard of accuracy, ease, and grace for his successors in this important enterprise. If the volumes that follow are at once as faithful and as readable, the little band of scholars whom Prof. Cowell has enlisted in the work will have rendered no small service to true culture by thus helping to make the East intelligible and interesting to the West.\n\nJ. E. C.\n\nChina, Present and Past. By R. S. Gundry, author of \"China and her Neighbours.\" London: Chapman and Hall, Ltd., 1895.\n\nMr. Gundry's new book on China is very opportune. It brings our information on the attitude of the Middle Kingdom towards her Western uninvited visitors down to the Japanese invasion of 1894. It is in a manner a supplement to the author's \"China and her Neighbours,\" and these two treatises are indispensable to all who would form clear and correct opinions on China in her relations with other countries.\n\nIn the introduction to \"China, Present and Past\" the author tells us how the book was made. Several of the chapters, we learn, are magazine articles amplified and brought up to date, while others are now published for the first time.\nNOTICES OF BOOKS.\n\nThe subjects of the book are numerous, grouped under the four categories\u2014Foreign Progress and Resources, Religious and Social, Yellow River. Under the first head the author gives an account of the early diplomatic intercourse between China and Western lands, and especially of the missions sent by Lord Macartney and Lord Amherst. We have here a chapter on the right of audience, in which the author gives an account of the struggle on this point from the conclusion of the Tientsin Treaty to 1894, when the Foreign Ministers were received by the Emperor for the first time in the Imperial palace. The author next proceeds to tell of the new system as in force for appointments to public offices, of the new departure made in establishing the Imperial Kuan and other government institutions for the promotion of learning. In a chapter headed \"Attainments,\" the author gives a sort of justification or excuse for the Chinese claim that Western science is founded on Chinese astrolabes, the author basing his remarks mainly on certain observations made by Remusat.\n\nThe next division of the book, which embraces a number of topics, is entitled \"Progress and Resources.\" It contains chapters on Signs of Progress, Industrial Resources, Currency, Trade with South-west China, Imperial Maritime Customs. Among the signs of progress are the large and increasing adoption of steamships by the Chinese to replace, not only the sea-going junks but also the river-boats, and the gradual introduction of steamships into the trade routes. The chapter on the trade with South-west China gives the most recent information about the trade routes and commerce of the empire. We have here some account of the trade on the West River of Kuangtung, and of the commerce in the region through which it flows. There is also a chapter on the Imperial Maritime Customs Service, which gives a very good summary of the history of the service, of its strength, and of the work it has done.\n\nFrom some points of view the most important\nbook under notice is that occupied with the Religious and Social topics. The author is fair and dispassionate in stating the case of the Chinese antagonism to missionaries and Christianity. The Chinese object to foreign missionaries as teaching immoral doctrines, as disturbing the existing state of affairs generally, as building on improper sites tall houses, or houses with tall spires calculated to offend the unseen powers. Mr. Gundry, however, is not quite correct in stating that the great French cathedral at Canton is \"a source of permanent irritation.\" On the contrary, this cathedral, with its double spire, is supposed by the natives to have had a very good effect on the district, the feng-shui of which is said to have improved since the erection of the cathedral. The author refers to some of the anti-missionary disturbances which have broken out in late years, and especially to the riots of 1891. In connection with the latter he quotes the edict issued by the Emperor on the subject in response to the importunate requests of the Foreign Ministers. This edict was extensively circulated among the officials and made generally public, and it had a good effect. In the translation quoted (p. 226) there is an error of the translator which is sufficiently important to require notice. He makes the Emperor write: \"The religion of the Western countries simply admonishes people to become virtuous, and the native converts are Chinese subjects under the jurisdiction of the local officials. The religions and peoples ought to exist peaceably side by side.\" Here the words \"The religions and peoples\" should be replaced by words like \"Our subjects, Christian and non-Christian,\" or \"The native Christians and the rest of the native community.\"\n\nThe chapter on Ancestor Worship is a very interesting one, and quotes good authorities. The attitude of Protestant missionaries towards ancestor worship has helped to make them and their religion disliked by the Chinese. These missionaries look on the services to the dead as worship, while Roman Catholic missionaries have been disposed, at least in some cases, to regard the services as not of the\nNOTICES OF BOOKS.\n\nnature of worship to a supernatural being. is disposed to hold the latter opinion, and he reasons. This is a subject upon which, not foreigners but also among Chinese, there is a variety of opinion. Nor can the conflicting easily reconciled, for the faith and practice of in the matter of ancestor worship are not places and at all periods.\n\nIn the chapter on the Goddess of Mercy unfortunate mistake. The author identifies Ku the Tien Hou, or Queen of Heaven, so largely along the sea-coast. But the Queen of He Ma Tsu (or Ma Teupu), mentioned afterward Gundry under the name Ma Chu. By foreigne is commonly called the Goddess of Mercy, but Chinese designation is Kuan-yin P'usa.\n\nThe last chapter in the Religious and Social the book is taken up with \"Judicial Torture legal punishments. For anyone acquainted wit of procedure of Chinese officials and their will not be easy to see why \"Judicial Torture under \"Religious and Social.\" Neither to nor the sufferer are the cruel tortures and pious exercises or religious functions, and there social about them. But the whole chapter is and especially for the very recent instances author has recalled to our notice.\n\nThe Yellow River, \"China's Sorrow,\" has itself, and the information brought together the vagaries of this dreadful river will prove and instructive to all readers. The workings of Chinese officialdom are seen in the treatn river better than in any other department of S One of the latest of the Directors General, W who has been in the North to repel the Japane as our author relates, to make a change by hav of trained experts to serve as surveyors. The Peking was that \"no notice be taken of the\nMr. Wu's Memorial is one of several interesting official documents given by Mr. Gundry as an Appendix.\n\nThe author of \"China, Present and Past\" is evidently not a man to joke or jest on serious subjects, and his book is eminently and throughout serious and solemn. Still, there is one small joke in it, and one which we must probably ascribe to the printer and not to the author. The joke will be found on p. 215, in the words \"Mr. Lecky's history of the rise of Ritualism in Europe.\"\n\nT. W.\n\nLes \u00c9tudes Chinoises (1891-1894). Par Henri Cordier, Professeur \u00e0 l'\u00c9cole des Langues Orientales vivantes, Paris. Leide: E. J. Brill, 1895.\n\nThis pamphlet is reprinted from the \"T'oung-pao,\" and the merits of its contents entitle it to an independent existence. The author begins by giving obituary notices of the lately deceased sinologists\u2014the Marquis D'Hervey de Saint-Denys, G. von der Gabelentz, and Terrien de Lacouperie. The notices include carefully compiled lists of all the contributions made to sinology by these distinguished men. In the case of M. de Lacouperie the list is a very long one, and many of the contributions recorded are merely short notes or articles contributed to magazines.\n\nThese accounts are followed by shorter obituary notices of such men as Mr. C. Rudy, M. A. A. Billequin\u2014\"un des Fran\u00e7ais qui ont fait le plus d'honneur \u00e0 leur pays dans l'Extr\u00eame Orient\"\u2014and M. Georgievsky.\n\nM. Cordier next proceeds to give a summary of sinological bibliography for the four years 1891 to 1894, beginning with China and Hongkong. This summary includes the Journals of the Societies, the China Review, the works of the Jesuit Missionaries, and the contributions of other workers chiefly in China. Under Germany we are told of the appointment of Dr. W. Grube to the chair held by the late G. von der Gabelentz. Under Austria the death of\nthe sinologist Dr. A. Pfizmaier is recorded, and we have a list of the contributions to sinology from Dr. Franz K\u00fchnert. In Belgium, we learn, Professor C. de Harlez is continuing to dash off books on Chinese subjects. M. Cordier, who gives the titles of four of the latest, states truly that the Professor \"traite avec la m\u00eame facilit\u00e9 du Tao-kiao ou de Jou-kiao, de la po\u00e9sie que de la m\u00e9decine ou de la musique.\"\n\nUnder France we have the announcement of the clever young scholar M. Chavannes to the Chair in the Coll\u00e8ge de France, held in succession by Abel Remusat, S. Julien, and the Marquis D'Hervey de Saint-Denys. We have also short notices of contributions to Chinese learning made by old acquaintances, such as M. Fauvel, Dr. E. Martin, and others.\n\nIn Great Britain we find Dr. Legge renewing his youth, writing on Chinese romances and poems, and bringing out a new edition of his Chinese Classics. But M. Cordier has to express his surprise at the little interest in Chinese studies which is taken by the people of these islands.\n\nUnder Holland we have special notice of the recent contributions to Chinese studies by Dr. G. Schlegel. Under Russia we learn what has been done with the Orkhon inscriptions. We have also a reference to Dr. Bretschneider's Travels in Mongolia, and to the great map of China which M. Waeber has compiled\u2014a work of many years.\n\nThis little book of 89 pages is full of useful information, given in a careful, precise manner. Like the author's work generally, it shows conscientious industry and general accuracy. I should like, however, to point out that the note on p. 15\u2014\"Miryak=Shi-jen\" or stone-men\u2014is not correct. Miryek is the Corean pronunciation of the two Chinese characters for Mi-lo, i.e. Maitreya.\n\nT. W.\nNOTICE SUR LE JAPON. PAR HENRI CORDIER. PARIS: H. LAMIRAUET ET CIE, 1894.\n\nThis is a separate reprint of M. Cordier's article \"Japon\" in the \"Grande Encyclop\u00e9die,\" now in course of publication. In compiling the article M. Cordier had, as he acknowledges, the co-operation of MM. Deniker, Dubois, De Millou\u00e9, and Pauly. We have in it some of the latest and most precise information about the new First Empire of the East. But as the compiler's space was necessarily very limited we do not expect full details on any department.\n\nWe have first a geographical summary giving the situation, boundaries, and natural features and character of the islands which constitute Japan. Next the Fauna and Flora are treated of, but in a very cursory manner. We have also sections dealing with the Religions, the Manners and Customs, the Government, Agriculture, History, Language, Literature, Fine Arts, and Legislation. The accounts of the Army, Navy, and Legislation are particularly interesting at the present moment, as they describe the changes which have been made in recent years down to the rupture with China last year.\n\nThe Map and the Bibliography appended to the article will be found very useful by all who wish to study the history and actual condition and prospects of Japan.\n\nT. W.\n\n\"The Pahlavi Text Series.\"\u2014Vol. I. Nirangistan: a Photo-zincographed Facsimile of one MS., with an Introduction and a Collation of another. Edited by Darab Dastur Peshotan Sanjana. (Bombay: Trustees of the Parsee Punchayet.)\n\nThe following is taken from The Academy of April 6th, 1895:\n\nWhen the late Prof. James Darmesteter was in Bombay, he delivered a lecture to the Parsi community upon their religion and sacred books, on February 2, 1887, in which\nhe earnestly advised them to raise a fund among themselves for the publication of a few important Pahlavi texts which existed only in rare or unique MSS. He further suggested that a Victoria Jubilee Pahlavi Text Fund would be a suitable Parsi memorial of the jubilee of the Queen-Empress, which was then rapidly approaching. The fund was raised and a committee was appointed to arrange for the publication of three such texts, one of which, edited by their secretary, a son of their high priest, has now appeared.\n\nSo far as is yet known, the Nirangistan consists of two or more fragments of the H\u016bsp\u0101ram Nask, one of the law-books of the Zoroastrian religion in Sasanian times; and it was probably copied in Persia about A.D. 1471, or earlier, from the remains of an old MS. long since lost. The copy of 1471, or an early descendant of it, was taken to India by a Persian priest in 1720, where it was copied by J\u0101m\u0101sp \u0100s\u0101, the best Pahlavi scholar of his time, in 1727; and it is his copy, now belonging to Dast\u016br H\u014dshang of Poona, that has been photographed for this edition, the copy brought from Persia having disappeared. The editor has also printed the text of some defective and missing folios, with a collation of the remainder, from an independent MS. obtained by Ervad Tahmuras from Persia some twenty years ago. This MS. is certainly older than J\u0101m\u0101sp \u0100s\u0101's copy, and is more complete at the beginning; but it has lost about sixteen folios at the end, and a few others are damaged. If these defects had not existed, it would have been the better MS. to have photographed. As it contains the text of three folios missing in the Indian copy, it must be descended from an earlier copy of the old MS. in Persia, written before that MS. had lost those three folios; and its text is generally more intelligible than that of the Indian copy.\n\nLike the Vendidad with Pahlavi, the Nirangistan contains an Avesta text alternating with its Pahlavi translation, but interspersed with much longer Pahlavi commentaries, so that the proportion of Pahlavi to Avesta text is nine\nto one, instead of the Vendidad proportion of rather more than two to one. The Avesta text has been extracted and translated, with the assistance of the Pahlavi, by Darmesteter in his French translation of the Zend-Avesta (vol. iii, pp. 78-148), and he has shown that it forms as connected a treatise as most parts of the Vendidad. An English translation of the same will accompany the second edition of his Vendidad in the \"Sacred Books of the East.\"\n\nAlthough Haug quoted passages from the Nirangistan in the Zend-Pahlavi Glossary (pp. 76, 77, 126) in 1867, and gave some account of the contents of the Nirangistan section of the H\u016bsp\u0101ram Nask in the Pahlavi-P\u0101sand Glossary (p. 130) in 1870, he did not attempt to identify the two texts. This identity seems to have been first suggested in the second edition of his Essays on the Parsis (p. 99), in 1878. But it was not until the epitome of the Nasks, contained in the Dinkard, was translated in 1892 in the \"Sacred Books of the East\" (vol. xxxvii) that the identity of the last seven-eighths of the Nirangistan MS. with the first three-fifths of the Nirangistan section of the H\u016bsp\u0101ram Nask became fully evident; while the beginning of the MS. was found to agree with the beginning of the \u0100\u0113rpatist\u0101n section of the same Nask. The \u0100\u0113rpatist\u0101n, or priest-code, contained the laws and regulations affecting the rights and duties of the Zoroastrian priesthood, and it preceded the Nirangistan, or ritual-code, which regulated the details of many religious ceremonies. There can be no doubt that these laws, collected and commented on in Sasanian times, will be of much interest to the Parsi priesthood when fully translated, while such of them as have become obsolete may afford a wide field for polemical dispute. To the laity, however, who are eminently practical, religious commentaries are only entertaining as records of old customs.\n\nThe facsimile of 195 octavo folios has been well executed by the Bombay Government Photo-zincographic Department; and the editor's collation of the Iranian MS. seems to have been carefully made. In his new edition of the\nPahlavi Vendidad, which is well advanced, he will have a better opportunity of displaying his abilities as an editor of texts. It should be noticed that the first folio of the facsimile commences with a short Nirang, or rite, for the preparation of the Vars, or filaments of hair, supposed to symbolize the ancient hair-sieve for filtering the H\u014dm-juice prepared and tasted during the ceremonies. This Nirang is followed by a Persian-Pahlavi colophon dated A.Y. 840 (the last of the three ciphers being unfortunately erased from the photograph); and the colophon states that the Nirang was found by the writer of that date (A.D. 1471) in the position he has copied it. It forms, however, no part of the Nirangist\u0101n.\n\nE. W. West.\n\nCatalogue of Sanskrit MSS. in the Raghunatha Temple Library of H.H. the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir. By M. A. Stein, Ph.D. (Bombay: Nirnaya Sagar Press, 1894. 4to, pp. xlix and 423.)\n\nThis catalogue has been prepared for the Kashmir State Council, and at its expense, by Dr. Stein, the Principal of the Oriental College, Lahore. It gives, in 240 pages, a list of titles of nearly 5000 MSS. arranged alphabetically under each of twenty-five heads (Vedas, Grammar, Law, Vedanta, Astronomy, Epics, etc.); with parallel columns giving, whenever ascertainable, the name of the author, state of the MS., character used, number of leaves, and general remarks. These data have been prepared in slips by native pandits on the spot specially selected for the work, and acting throughout under Dr. Stein's direction and supervision. Introductory chapters are devoted to the history of the library, and to special notes on particularly noteworthy MSS. A supplementary division (125 pages) is devoted to extracts from the more important MSS., giving the beginnings, the endings, the colophons, and occasionally other passages. There follow complete indices to authors, to books, and to miscellaneous notices.\nThe library was established by the present Maharaja's father to supply the practical wants of the Sanskrit school (P\u0101\u1e6dha\u015b\u0101l\u0101) founded by him at Raghun\u0101tha. The Jammu pandits, through whom the collection was made, \"had to keep in view,\" as is stated in the preface, \"the requirements of the school,\" and could scarcely be expected to appreciate the historical value of works which had long ago ceased to be studied by the indigenous scholar. Nor were they likely to take special pains about the acquisition of MSS. of great age and critical interest, seeing that in practical use such copies would often have been anything but convenient. It is apparent, however, from Dr. Stein's notes that a very considerable number of works in this library have been hitherto almost, if not quite, unknown to Western scholars.\n\nThe labour involved in the completion of this catalogue must have been very great, and we congratulate both the Kashmir Government and Dr. Stein upon the wisely thought-out plan, and the careful carrying out of a most important and useful undertaking.\n\n**Liber Ma\u1e6d\u012b\u1e25 al-\u014cl\u016bm explicans vocabula technica scientiarum tam Arabum quam peregrinarum auctore Ab\u016b Abdall\u0101h Mohammed ibn Ahmed ibn J\u016bsof al-K\u0101tib al-Khowarezmi. Edidit, indices adiecit C. Van Vloten. Lugduni Batavorum: E. J. Brill, 1895, pp. 7 and ff.**\n\nThe \"Keys of the Sciences\" is the name of a small but most comprehensive encyclopaedia of technical terms of all branches of knowledge with which the Arab world was acquainted at the end of the tenth century. It gives evidence not only of the rapidity with which Arab students had, in the short space since the awakening of Moalim science, mastered nearly every subject which then offered a field for research, but also of the progress made in methodical work. In this respect the MO\u2014as well as the\nnearly contemporaneous Kit\u0101b al-Fihrist\u2014is greatly superior to later books of similar character, e.g. the Kit\u0101b al-Ta'rifat, which, being an alphabetical reference book of technical terms, scarcely extends beyond theology, philosophy, and linguistic. Now, although many of its paragraphs are longer than in the MO, the latter not only collects the terms belonging to each subject very systematically into groups, but also comments upon their etymologies. The omission of an alphabetical arrangement has, however, been made good by the editor, who attached a very complete index to the text.\n\nDr. Van Vloten justly points out, that the author does not name all the sources upon which he drew for his information. It seems to me that he was not always able to do so, because in some cases he evidently did not rely upon written books at all, but upon verbal instruction, which led to some inaccuracies. In a short introduction he states his object to be first of all a linguistic one, viz. to save those who wish to write a book on a special subject from employing incongruous expressions. He gives several instances which tend to show how the same term assumes different meanings in the different departments of science.\n\nThe book itself is divided into two parts, of which the first treats of subjects, sacred and profane, peculiar to Arabic-speaking mankind, whilst the second is devoted to foreign (Persian and Greek) branches of knowledge. As a matter of course, the book begins with an enumeration of the terms of the Fiqh in all its subdivisions, but, strange to say, omits to give a definition of the term Qor\u0101n\u00b9 (see KT. p. 181). The (second) chapter on the Kal\u0101m not only offers a list of the Moslim sects, both Sunnite and Shiite, but also of those of the Christian and Jewish churches. In those rather unfamiliar subjects the author evidently derived his information from verbal instruction. His mistakes are, however, of some linguistic interest. He traces back \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0646\u0627\u064a\u062a\u064a\u0647 (the Qaraite followers of \u0100n\u0101n) to\n\n\u00b9 \u0627\u0642\u0631\u0623\u0627\u0646 in the index is a misprint for \u0623\u0642\u0631\u0622\u0646 (without Madda).\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1895.\nwhich name he, according to his own illustration, framed on the analogy of \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0626\u0629, the followers of \u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a. With this vulgar Nisba he gives a few pages later on (p. 37) the formation \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0626\u0629, which might have been looked for also on p. 34. But evidently influenced by his faulty explanation of \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0646\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629, he adds \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u062f\u0631\u064a \u0644\u0645 \u062c\u0639\u0644\u0648\u0627 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0633\u0628\u0629 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0642\u064a\u0627\u0633 \u0648\u0643\u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0646\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0633\u0648\u0628\u0629 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u062d\u0632\u0622\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0646\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0639\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0647\u0648\u062f (see Wright, Grammar I, \u00a7254). He then mentions the sect \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0639\u064a\u0629 with the very peculiar explanation \u0623\u0643\u062b\u0631 \u0637\u0639\u0627\u0645\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0642\u0648\u0644 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0639 \u0648\u0623\u0643\u062b\u0631 \u0623\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0639. It is possible that the author here followed the account of Ab\u016b Y\u016bsuf Ya\u02bfqub al-Qirqis\u0101n\u012b (937), who, however, gives no satisfactory explanation of the name of this sect. Perhaps it is nothing but a misinterpretation of the general name of the Qara\u00eftes, which is usually spelt \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0626\u0629 or \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0647.\n\nThe chapter treating on the grammatical terms is very full, and also frequently draws attention to the different employments of terms in the schools of Ba\u1e63ra and K\u016bfa. The definitions of the single terms are pleasingly terse, and, beside being much more detailed than in the KT, furnish a whole grammar in nuce.\n\nOf special interest is the chapter on public affairs, comprising the Boards of taxes, finances, mail, army, estates, measures, weights, and distribution of water. As a matter of course there are here many foreign words, especially Persian, of which the author adds the etymologies. The paragraph on rhetoric attached to this chapter forms a very welcome supplement to Mehren\u2019s list (Die Rhetorik der Araber, Wien, 1853). The chapter on poetry which comes next contains a complete theory of prosody (fifteen metres with their branches and poetic licenses), many example verses, further the rules of the rhyme, the\n\n---\n\n1 Al-Mahrast\u0101n\u012b, ed.

The list goes down as far as At-Ta'i, who ascended the throne 974 (cf. Editor's preface, p. 4). To this are attached lists of kings of Yaman and Ma'add in the pre-Islamic period. The series of the \"Kings of R\u00fcm\" begins with the successors of Alexander of Macedonia. In this list the author enumerates ten rulers who had each the name Ptolemy, and among whom he also places the author of the Almagest. To this chapter are joined explanations of (mostly Persian) expressions connected with the record mentioned before. A special chapter treats of the \"(battle-)days of the Arabs.\"\n\nThe second part of the book begins with a definition of the term philosophy, its divisions and its relation to logic. This is followed by some chapters on theology, or rather metaphysics, in which the whole repertory of the Arab scholastic school is displayed. Logic (\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0644\u0633\u0641\u0629) and propaedeutics occupy one chapter, and Aristotle's categories another. Expositions of other writings of Aristotle follow, in which the author also included one on Sophism. The next section treats of diseases and medicaments. Then follows arithmetic, with a table of the numbers till a thousand, also a tablet showing the numerical value of the letters of the alphabet. Geometry and stereometry form the contents of the following piece. In the section on astronomy one chapter is devoted to the names of the planets, both Arabic and Persian, to the zodiac, \"stations\" of the moon and the other constellations, others to spherical geometry and astronomical instruments. Chapters on music, mechanics, and chemistry close the book.\n\nThis brief sketch will show how well advised Dr. Van Vloten was to undertake the publication of the book. The nature of the subject and the unusual amount of foreign words rendered the task rather embarrassing, and the\ncopyists of the MSS. have contributed little to smooth the difficulties. The editor, however, managed to steer with great skill and discrimination through the very numerous variae lectiones and corruptions. On p. 3, l. 3 it is perhaps better to read (with C) \"who brings out (a book) on Adab.\" In the index sub \u0627\u0644\u0634\u06cc\u0639\u0629 read r.\n\nOn the whole the edition affords a new proof of the thoroughness and efficiency of the Leyden school.\n\nH. HIRSCHFELD.\n\nThe Buddhism of Tibet, or Lamaism, with its Mystic Cults, Symbolism, and Mythology, and in its Relation to Indian Buddhism. By L. AUSTINE WADDELL, M.B., F.L.S., F.R.G.S., etc. London: W. H. Allen and Co., Ltd., 1895.\n\nThis book comes to supply a serious want, long felt by all who take an interest in Buddhism and its developments. It is, in fact, the first Western book giving a practical account of Lamaism derived from or based on original research among Tibetan books and Tibetan monks and people. \"The special characteristics of the book,\" to quote the words of the Preface, \"are its detailed accounts of the external facts and curious symbolism of Buddhism, and its analyses of the internal movements leading to Lamaism and its sects and cults. It provides material culled from hoary Tibetan tradition, and explained to me by Lamas for elucidating many obscure points in primitive Indian Buddhism and its later symbolism. Thus a clue is supplied to several disputed doctrinal points of fundamental importance, as for example the formula of the Causal Nexus. And it interprets much of the interesting Mahayana and Tantrik developments in the later Indian Buddhism of Magadha.\"\n\nThe author groups the subjects of which he treats in the present book under eight comprehensive headings. The first is entitled \"Historical,\" and under it we have accounts\nof the Changes in Primitive Buddhism leading to L\u0101maism, of the Rise, Development, and Spread of L\u0101maism, and of the Sects of L\u0101maism. In the second group, headed \"Doctrinal,\" the subjects treated of are the Metaphysical Sources of the Doctrine, the Doctrine and its Morality, and Scriptures and Literature. Under the third heading, \"Monastic,\" the author gives minute descriptions of the Order of L\u0101mas, the Daily Life and Routine, and of the Hierarchy and Re-incarnate L\u0101mas. In the fourth group, entitled \"Buildings,\" we have Temples and Cathedrals, and Shrines and Relics. The fifth group, \"Mythology and Gods,\" includes the Pantheon and Images, and the Sacred Symbols and Charms. In the sixth group, headed \"Ritual and Sorcery,\" we have chapters on Worship and Ritual, Astrology and Divination, and Sorcery and Necromancy. \"Festivals and Plays\" is the title of the seventh heading, under which we have chapters on Festivals and Holidays, and on Sacred Dramas, Mystic Plays, and Masquerades. The eighth and last group is entitled \"Popular L\u0101maism,\" and it has a short chapter on Domestic and Popular L\u0101maism.\n\nAs Appendices the author has given a very useful Chronological Table and an excellent Bibliography. There is also a good Index, and the treatise is profusely illustrated, the illustrations being \"mostly from originals brought from Lhasa and from photographs by the author.\"\n\nThis book is not easy reading. It bristles over with ugly Tibetan words and sentences, and it treats of subjects most of which must be quite new to all readers. It is, however, a most painstaking and thoroughly honest attempt to present to the student all that is known or can be known about the religion of Tibet. The author has evidently made a careful study of Buddhism and its fortunes in other countries before proceeding to treat of the history and peculiar developments of that religion in Tibet, and he shows an extensive acquaintance with the chief contributions of Western writers on Buddhistic subjects. It is impossible to give here even a meagre outline or abstract of the\ncontents of his book. It is full of useful and curious information, at times overflowing into long notes.\n\nThe account of the changes which led to L\u0101maism, and of the origin and growth of that sect and of the sub-sects which arose in it, is specially interesting. It is possible, however, that some students of Northern Buddhism may feel disposed to take exception to the author's description and estimate of the great Mah\u0101y\u0101na system. Moreover, in treating of the present distribution of L\u0101maism, he puts down the Chinese province of Manchuria as \"largely L\u0101maist, with a population of about 3,000,000.\" But L\u0101maism certainly does not prevail in Manchuria at present, either among the Chinese or Manchoos. Near the capital, Moukden, there are two small Buddhist monasteries, with Tibetan L\u0101mas in them, but these and probably the other L\u0101ma temples in Manchuria are merely imperial chapels.\n\nThe account which Dr. Waddell gives of the L\u0101mas themselves also is exceedingly interesting. He describes minutely for us the training of the Tibetan boy devoted to the sacred office, the grades through which he has to pass before he receives ordination as a priest, his material equipment, the various degrees of rank among the priests, and the \"Re-incarnate L\u0101mas.\" The discipline of the monastic establishments, and the great authority exercised by the higher L\u0101mas over those of inferior rank, and also allowed to them over the common lay-people, are fully described.\n\nOur author gives also a most interesting account of the numerous religious services performed on various occasions at the request of laymen. Many of these services, he shows, do not belong to any form of Buddhism, but to the old demon-worship of pre-Buddhist times. He shows also how deeply the fear of malignant unseen powers enters into the daily life of the Tibetans, and, connected with that subject, how the L\u0101mas have obtained a spiritual power over the people which holds all in abject servitude. Then follow chapters which give copious information about the Pantheon and Images of Tibetan worship, about the\nSacred Symbols and Charms, about Worship and Ritual, Astrology and Divination, Sorcery and Necromancy, and the Domestic and Popular Lamaism. These chapters will afford useful and interesting reading, not only to the students of Buddhism but also to all who are interested in religion and folklore. For, as the author shows, much of the worship and many of the beliefs and practices prevalent among the Tibetans are due to low types of religion and knowledge not connected with Buddhism. \"Both Lamas and people,\" he writes, \"are so steeped in pagan superstition and idolatry that their un-Buddhist features and practices are most conspicuous. As the Tibetans see nature in its ultimate stronghold, in all its pitiless force and fury, terrorizing the brave as well as the timid, their child-like character impels them to worship the more proximate agents which seem to visibly wreck their fields and flocks, and vex them as with disease and disaster.\n\nTheir inveterate craving for material protection against those malignant gods and demons has caused them to pin their faith on charms and amulets, which are to be seen everywhere dangling from the dress of every man, woman, and child\" (p. 570).\n\nT. W.\n\nNotes on African Philology.\n\nThe most notable feature is the appearance of the \"Zeitschrift fur africanische und oceanische Sprachen,\" edited by Herr A. Seidel, Secretary of the German Colonial Society. It is published at Berlin (D. Reimer), and appears quarterly in parts, and quarto-sized paper, in the German language, but Roman characters. Part I and II for January and April, 1895, are before me: these are most important contributions on African languages by the Editor, and Dr. Christaller, and Grube, and Meinhof, and Krause. The contributors are chiefly German, and the languages are chiefly within the sphere of German influence, but the enterprise is a most important one, and deserves every\nsupport. It is much to be regretted that there is not a similar publication for the scores of languages spoken in the African Colonies, Protectorates, and spheres of influence of Great Britain. One paper on the languages of Oceania is contributed by an accomplished young English Board-School Master, Mr. Sidney Ray.\n\n**North Africa.**\n\nI. Major-General F. T. Haig has published in London, in 1895, a tentative Grammar of the Beidawi language, spoken by the tribes in the North-Eastern Sudan, with short vocabulary and sentences. It consists of only seventy-nine small pages: the author spent some months at Suakin, while engaged in assisting the distribution of relief in the famine-stricken tribes, who had crowded down to that Fort. On his return to England he supplemented his original collection by reference to the celebrated work by Professor Almkvist, of Upsala, in Sweden.\n\n**West Africa.**\n\nII. Major Leonard Darwin, M.P., has published in the *National Review* a paper on the Niger Territories and Hausa Association, which has for its object to gather information with regard to the Hausa language, the important lingua franca of that part of Africa.\n\nIII. A new accession to our knowledge of the languages of the Guinea coast has come to us under the title of Manuel Dahom\u00e9en, by M. Delafosse, comprising an introduction, grammar, reader, and dictionary. The inhabitants of the Kingdom of Dah\u00f3mey speak a dialect of the far-spread Ew\u00e9 language.\n\n**South Africa.**\n\nIV. Dr. Laws has published at Edinburgh an important English-Nyanja Dictionary. This is an important language spoken in the neighbourhood of the Ny\u00e1sa lake in British Central Africa. It is primarily for the use of the Missionaries of the Free Church of Scotland, but it is a great addition to knowledge.\nV. I mention the remaining small works of the Bantu Family of languages collectively: In Swahili we have to record a new edition of St. Matthew's Gospel in the Arabic character; in Kaguru portions of the Book of Common Prayer; the same, as well as hymns, in the language of Taveta, a mountainous district about 120 miles W.N.W. of Mombasa, to which language Mr. J. A. Wray has also written an excellent grammatical introduction. The language, treated of in this little manual, is called Sagalla. We further mention a Catechism and a Primer in Ganda, and a First Reading Book in Nyanja. The Universities' Mission Press at Magila, in the Bondei district, has issued a volume of Bondei Exercises, on the plan of Steere's Swahili Exercises, by the Rev. G. Dale, a very accurate and trustworthy book. There is also a book of Stories, Enigmas, and Proverbs, in the same language, edited by the Rev. H. W. Woodward, and a translation of the Gospel of St. Matthew. From South Africa we have received a useful English-Mashona Dictionary, with conversations, by the Rev. A. M. Hartmann, and a Dictionary of Suto by the late Rev. A. Mabille. Approaching now the great Angola Region in Portuguese Africa, we first note an essay by Heli Chatelain, on the geographic names in the province. This paper and the three following have appeared in the Bulletin of the American Geographical Society. They are entitled \"Bantu Notes and Vocabularies,\" and treat of Shilange and Luba, with comparative lists of words in Bundu, Bangala, Kioko, Lunda, Songe, Kuba, Beneki, Teke, and a few other languages. We owe to the same Bantu scholar also a volume of \"Folk-tales of Angola,\" in the original Bundu, with English translation, an introduction, and notes.\n\nNotes on Oceanic Philology.\n\nI. Graf von der Schulenburg has published, at Leipzig, a Grammar, Vocabulary, and Sentences, of the language\nof Murray Island, adjacent to New Guinea: it is in the German language, and comprises 133 pages.\n\nII. I mention the publications of that industrious and promising scholar, Mr. Sidney Ray, collectively:\n\n(1) Note on a Vocabulary of Ulia, in the Caroline Islands. 1890.\n\n(2) Sketch of Aulua Grammar, with Vocabulary of Aulua, Lamangkan, Malekula, New Hebrides, in Melanesia. 1893.\n\n(3) Language of British New Guinea: Journal of Anthropological Society. 1894.\n\nParts I. and II.\n\n(4) Languages of the New Hebrides: Royal Society of New South Wales. 1895.\n\n(5) Oceanic Ethnology. 1895.\n\nVI.

XXI.\u2014Southern Chin Vocabulary (Minbu District).\nBy Bernard Houghton, M.R.A.S.\n\nThe accompanying words and phrases of Southern Chin, as spoken at the foot of the Arakan Yoma Mountains in the Minbu district, were taken down a few years since by Major B. A. N. Parrott, I.S.C., who later on presented to me the book in which they were written, along with others on Oriental subjects. They are interesting as representing the most Northern dialect of this language, which reaches its most Southern point in the Sandoway district. (I pass by the dialect spoken in Bassein and the South of Henzada as being much corrupted by the extended intercourse which has there taken place between the Chins and the Burmans.) In publishing now this Vocabulary of Minbu Chin it has seemed advisable to compare it word by word with that of the Sandoway district, not merely in order to show more clearly the dialectic variations which exist, but also as an assistance towards the elucidation of the still obscure philological laws which obtain in this family of languages. In a speech which has suffered so\nextraordinarily from phonetic corruption and decay as this latter, all evidence which will in any way tend to join together the scattered links of verbal stems and endings must be considered as scientifically useful.\n\nAs regards the accuracy of the list of Minbu Chin words, it will suffice to say that even if they had not the *imprimatur* of so able an officer as Major Parrott, the internal evidence is all in favour of their being a careful and painstaking representation of the spoken words of the people themselves. I have ventured, however, to bring the spelling into line with that now usually adopted in reference to the languages of the Far East, the method of transliteration authorized by the Burmese Government hardly answering all the requirements of a true scientific system. It should be added that the modified *u* (\u00fc), which probably exists, is not distinguished from *u* simple, nor are any tones represented.\n\nMost of the verbs are given in the present tense, or rather aorist, and in these, as well as in the few forms given separately from the vocabulary, there will be noticed a curious variation in the affix\u2014a variation which seems partly, but not altogether, due to a law of phonetic sequence. Thus, we have *he-it* 'he asks,' but *su-ot* 'he assembles,' and *tauk-\u00f6t* 'it is born.' Occasionally the *t* changes to *k*, as *h\u00f6n-\u00f6k* or *h\u00f6n-ot* 'it is dark.' This change, as well as intercalated *w*, (*o-wot* 'it burns'), is common enough in languages of this family, but the same cannot be said of the *h*, which is sometimes prefixed to *ot*, as in *l\u0101-ko-hot*. *H* generally represents a softened *k*, or *k\u0325*, and is never used merely euphonically. The termination *ot*, *it*, or *\u00f6k* is, I apprehend, merely the verb *ot* 'to be,' 'to remain,' (Burm. *n\u0113*), but whether this verb has dropped an initial *h* or whether the *h* in the termination represents another root compounded with *ot* is doubtful, though the latter seems the more plausible explanation. In the centre of the Sandoway district *\u00fc* is the termination of the aorist, and *ni-\u00fc* of the past, as compared with *h\u00fc* and *ni-h\u00fc* in the more Northern parts.\nThe *a* inserted in some cases before *hot* would seem to be merely euphonical. *Palon* or *pon* in the past tense appears to be the same as *pin* in the Sandoway Chin perfect, and indeed, judging from the form of the verb, it is not improbable that it is really a perfect and not a past tense.\n\nThe termination *n\u0113* or *n\u0113* for the imperative, if correct, is certainly curious, as in the Sandoway district this is the termination for the negative imperative, (do not go). *Ni* for 'may' is possibly a corruption of the Burmese colloquial *nain*, as the regular S. Chin verb *k'o* is also used.\n### Verbal Paradigms, etc.\n\n| Minbu | Sandoway | Minbu | Sandoway |\n|-------|----------|-------|----------|\n| ka l\u00f3. | ka l\u00f3 ni\u00fc. | ka sai-it. | ka sit-ii. |\n| ka l\u00f3 pal\u00f3k | ka l\u00f3-waith. | ka sai-pal\u00f3n-h\u00f4t. | ka sit-ni\u00fc. |\n| ka l\u00f3-w\u00e9-i | lo-w\u00e9. | ka sai-i | ka si-yaib. |\n| lu-ne | Go (thou) | sit-ne | sit-we. |\n| ka l\u00f3 k'o-wo. | I may go | ka sai-i-'ni | ka sit k'o-wo. |\n| m' l\u00f3-waith m. | Will you go? | n' sai-i 'ni m. | m' si-yaib m. |\n\n---\n\n**I bring**\n\nka l\u00f3-w\u00e9\n\n**I brought**\n\nka l\u00f3 ni\u00fc\n\n**I will bring**\n\nka l\u00f3-waith\n\n**Bring (thou)**\n\nlo-w\u00e9\n\n**I may bring**\n\nka l\u00f3 k'o-wo.\n\n**Will you bring?**\n\nm' l\u00f3-waith m.\n\n---\n\n**I come**\n\nka lo-wo.\n\n**I came**\n\nka lo ni\u00fc.\n\n**I will come**\n\nka lo waith.\n\n**Come (thou)**\n\nlo-w\u00e9.\n\n**I may come**\n\nka lo k'o-wo.\n\n**Will you come?**\n\nm' lo-waith m.\n\n---\n\n**I sell**\n\nka ye-yi.\n\n**I sold**\n\nka ye-p\u00fcn h\u00f3t.\n\n**I will sell**\n\nka ye-yi.\n\n**Sell (thou)**\n\nye 'n\u00e1.\n\n**I may sell**\n\nka yi-k'o-wo.\n\n**Will you sell?**\n\nm' ye-yi m.\n\n---\n\n1.

XXII.\u2014On the Medi\u00e6val Castle and Sanctuary of Abrik, the modern Arabkir; with some further Notes on Mesopotamia as described by Ibn Serapion. By Guy Le Strange.\n\nFrom two of my friends, Professor De Goeje and Mr. Hogarth, I have had the good fortune to receive many corrections for my recent paper on Ibn Serapion,\u00b9 and these I now hasten to publish, as throwing much new light on the subject of the geography of Mesopotamia in the time of the Caliphs.\n\nMr. D. G. Hogarth has recently returned from a voyage in Asia Minor. The critical remarks which he has sent me refer especially to the proper identification of the streams described by Ibn Serapion, and these are of the highest value, as being the testimony of one who has himself travelled over the whole of this country; for it must always be remembered that the Kiepert map (the best we possess for this region) is here far from accurate, besides being very deficient in detail.\n\nWith what Mr. Hogarth writes I have intercalated the more important of the series of corrections and remarks, extending over the whole of my paper, which Professor De Goeje, of Leyden, was good enough to forward to me a short time after the receipt of my paper. No words of mine are needed to emphasize the value of emendations by the scholar who has edited the text of Tabari and the series of the Bibliotheca Geographorum Arabicorum.\n\nThe corrections for the Arabic text (chiefly grammatical) I must keep for future publication, but I may take this\n\n\u00b9 See J.R.A.S. for January and April of this year.\nopportunity gratefully to acknowledge how much I feel indebted, both to Professor De Goeje and to Mr. Hogarth, for the kindness they have done me in thus minutely examining my work, and for the liberality with which they have placed the results of their criticism at my disposal.\n\nBefore, however, communicating the notes which have been sent me, I must in the first place plead guilty to a notable blunder made in identifying the Castle of Abrik (see pp. 58, 63, and 65) with the Byzantine Tephrik\u0113, which is the modern Divrigi, situated on the Tchalta Irmak. As it has been rightly marked on my map, the Castle of Abrik, which stood on the Nahr Abrik, is undoubtedly to be identified with the present Arabkir lying on the Saritchit-chek Su; for this latter stream is the Nahr Abrik described by Ibn Serapion. My blunder was caused by a note in the recent edition of Mas\u2018\u016bdi\u2019s \u201cTanbih,\u201d where it is stated (note d to p. 183) that by \u1e32al\u2018a Abrik \u201cintelligitur urbs Tephrik\u0113.\u201d The rivers as given by Ibn Serapion, however (see pp. 54 and 63), prove beyond question that the Abrik fortress is to be identified with the modern Arabkir; while Divrigi, which lies a short three-days journey to the north of Arabkir, is doubtless the \u201cSingle Fortress\u201d which Ibn Serapion (p. 54) refers to as standing on the Nahr L\u016bkiya.\n\nWhile on the subject of Abrik, I may take the opportunity of giving a translation of the curious account which Y\u0101k\u016bt quotes in his \u201cGeographical Dictionary\u201d (i, p. 87), having copied it from the work of his contemporary \u2018Ali of Herat, who wrote about the year 1215 A.D.\u00b9\n\nY\u0101k\u016bt, who spells the name Al-Abr\u016bk, says that the place lies in the Greek country, and that it is a sanctuary venerated alike by both Christians and Moslems, who come thither from afar in pilgrimage. He then quotes the description given by \u2018Ali of Herat, as follows:\n\n\u201cThe account that I heard caused me to visit the place, which I found to lie on the flank of a mountain. You enter\n\n\u00b9 For an account of \u2018Ali of Herat see \u201cPalestine under the Moelme,\u201d p. 8.\nby a gate in a tower, and walk some distance underground, until you come to a wide space where the mountains open out so that the sky is seen. In the centre of this space is a lake, and round its border are houses belonging to the Greek husbandmen, their arable fields lying at the back thereof. There is seen here a beautiful church as well as a mosque; hence, if the visitor be a Moslem he is conducted to the mosque, while if he be a Christian he is taken to the church. Further there is an upper-house, where on entering you may see the bodies of certain men who have been slain, for they bear the marks of lance-thrusts and sword-blows, and some of them have lost their limbs. They are clothed in cotton raiment, and this has not rotted. In another place are four bodies standing upright, being supported with their backs against the wall of the cavern. Among them is a youth who has placed his hand on the head of one of the men, the tallest of them all, who is brown-skinned, and he wears a cotton vest. His hand is outstretched as though he would grasp something, and the head of the youth is near his wrist. Next to him is a man whose face has received a cut that has divided his upper lip so that the teeth show. All these men wear turbans. Close beside them stands a woman carrying a child in her arms, whom she suckles at the breast. Further there are to be seen five other men, all standing upright and with their backs to the wall of the place. Here also, in a high upper-chamber, is a throne, on which sit twelve men, and among them a youth whose hands and feet are dyed (red) with henna. The Greeks assert that these men were of their nation, while the Moslems say they were certain warriors of Isl\u00e2m who went forth in the days of the Caliph \u2018Omar\u2014may Allah accept him!\u2014and who were put to death here in cold blood. The people stated also, in regard to them, that their nails grow and that their heads need to be shaved. But there is no surety in all this: the only fact being that\n\n1 Is it possible that this may refer to some statue of the Virgin and Child, while the \"youth\" and his companions represented Christ with his Apostles?\nthe skin is now quite dry on their bones, and hence the bodies do not suffer decay.\"\n\nThus far from 'Ali of Herat, who, though a pious pilgrim, is evidently animated by a certain spirit of criticism. The only other detail that may help to fix the identification of this place, is the statement found in Mas'\u016bdi (\"Tanbih,\" p. 183, and \"Meadows of Gold,\" viii, p. 74) that Abrik was the capital city of the Bailaki people; but who these were, I have been unable to determine.\n\nThe following paragraphs contain the substance of the notes which Professor De Goeje and Mr. Hogarth have sent me:\n\nOf the places lying on the Tigris, Professor De Goeje, correcting my note on p. 35, line 6, writes that the ancient Persian name of Mosul was B\u016bdh Ardash\u012br (see Ibn Khurdadbih, p. 17), not Nawardash\u012br or Bawardash\u012br as given in Y\u0101k\u016bt. Turning to page 41, Dayr \u1e32unn\u0101, situated on the Tigris below Baghd\u0101d, is named, on the authority of Y\u0101k\u016bt, the Convent of Marm\u0101r\u012b As-Sal\u012bkh, \"the Impotent.\" This last epithet should be changed to As-Sal\u012b\u1e25, meaning Marm\u0101r\u012b \"the Apostle,\" as appears from the more correct text of the \"Tanbih,\" p. 149.\n\nIn the description of the Euphrates (p. 47), the town of Al-Mub\u0101rik (line 6) should be written Al-Mub\u0101rak \"the Blessed\" (the passive not the active participle), and the same correction applies to the other Al-Mub\u0101rak mentioned on pages 307 and 308. In the next place, line 13 of page 47 demands an important correction, for it involves an emendation of the text. Turning back to page 10, line 12, it will be seen that the MS. gave the reading bi-l-\u2018arbi wa, which, to make sense, I had emended by the addition of a diacritical point to read bi-l-gharbi (omitting the wa \"and\"), and translating (see p. 47) \"to the westward of\" Al-Anb\u0101r. The true reading, as Professor De Goeje writes, is without a doubt bi-r-Rabb wa, and the translation (on p. 47, line 13) should read: The Euphrates comes \"next to the city of Hit, from whence it flows by\nAr-Rabb and Al-Anb\u0101r.\u201d Ar-Rabb is the halting-place on the road from Hit to Al-Anb\u0101r, being twelve leagues or two marches from the former and seven leagues or one march from the latter city (cf. Ibn Khurd\u0101dbih, p. 72; Kud\u0101ma, p. 217; and Mukaddasi, p. 134). From this point, as I shall have cause to show later on, the old Dujayl canal branched off from the Euphrates.\n\nComing now to the affluents of the Euphrates and their tributaries, Professor De Goeje has the following: The name of the tributary of the Arsan\u0101s (p. 63, line 6 and note 1) is better written Salk\u012bt, without the Arabic article, it being a foreign proper name. In the paragraph relating to the river Kar\u0101k\u012bs, an emendation of the Arabic text is needed (p. 13, line 7 from below) where, the diacritical point being wanting in the MS., I have printed min bahri Bil\u0101di-r-R\u016bm. Bahr, literally \u201csea,\u201d I had supposed to be a slip for Bu\u1e25ayra \u201clake,\u201d and so translated it. But for Bahr read Nahr, and translate (p. 63, line 19): The source of the Kar\u0101k\u012bs \u201cis in the confines of the Greek Country.\u201d In the next paragraph Professor De Goeje holds that Az-Zarn\u016bk (not Az-Zarb\u016bk) is the true reading. The word Zarn\u016bk, in Lane\u2019s dictionary, has among other significations the meaning of \u201crivulet\u201d; and the Arabic article shows that the name is not one of foreign origin.\n\nConcerning the other tributary of the Kub\u0101kib river, which Ibn Serapion calls J\u016br\u012bth, but which Y\u0101k\u016bt writes H\u016br\u012bth (see p. 63, antepenultimate paragraph, and note 5, p. 67), Professor De Goeje would hold to the spelling J\u016br\u012bth; unless there were better evidence against it than Y\u0101k\u016bt, a late authority, and who certainly knew nothing about the stream from personal knowledge. Besides the good authority of our MS., it must be remembered that the guttural \u1e25 being a purely Arabic (Semitic) letter, the j is more likely to occur in a foreign name, as the one in question undoubtedly is. In the matter of Al-Hadath, which lies near this stream, my note (p. 67) has a mistranslation of the passage quoted from Bil\u0101dh\u016br\u012b (Bal\u0101dh\u016br\u012b, by the way, is the more correct pronunciation). What this\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1895.\nauthority really says is that the place was originally called Darb-al-Hadath, \"the Road of (bad) News or Luck.\" This, for a better augury, was changed to Darb-as-Sal\u0101ma, \"the Road of Safety or Good Luck.\"\n\nIn regard to the tributary of the Abrik river which Ibn Serapion refers to as the Nahr Zamra (see p. 65), Mr. Hogarth would identify this stream with the modern Kiztek Tchai, whose waters join the Saritchitchek (the Abrik river) two hours below Arabkir. Contrary to what is shown on the Kiepert map, Mr. Hogarth writes that the Miram Tchai (with which I had identified the Zamra) does not flow into the Saritchitchek Su, but falls directly into the Euphrates, below Ankhiti.\n\nThe next affluent of the Euphrates below the Abrik river is the Nahr Anj\u0101. This, instead of being the stream at the mouth of which lies the village of Tchermik (see p. 58), is more likely to be the stream now called the Soyut Tchai, a broad river flowing into the Euphrates about two hours march to the north-east of Tchermik. On its bank (Mr. Hogarth states) is the favourite halting-place for travellers going from Arabkir to Malatya, or from Hakim Kh\u0101n (Sivas road) to the ferry across the Euphrates at Keban Ma'den.\n\nWe now come to the Kub\u0101kib river, which, after the Arsan\u0101s, is the chief affluent of the Upper Euphrates. This river in ancient times was called the Melas, while at present it is known as the Tokhma Su (see p. 58). One of its main tributaries is the Karak\u012bs, which I had identified (p. 65) with the present Sult\u0101n Su, coming down from the mountains to the south-west of Malatya. Now, as Mr. Hogarth points out, the whole region of Malatya and the country lying westward towards Mar'ash had by the time of Ibn Serapion (900 A.D.) been permanently conquered and settled by the Moslems. Hence this could not then be known as \"the Greek country\" (p. 63) where the Karak\u012bs is stated to take its rise. It seems probable, therefore, in the first place, that the Zarn\u016bk river, which rises \"in a mountain between Malatya and \u1e24i\u1e63n Mans\u016br,\" and its\nbranch-stream, the River of Malatya, should together be identified with the Sultan Su aforesaid. In the second place it is more likely that the Karakis is a north-bank affluent of the Tokhma Su, probably the present Aivali Dereh, which flows out of the mountains of Cappadocia, i.e. \"the Greek country.\" Mr. Hogarth describes the Aivali Dereh as being so important an affluent of the Tokhma Su, that Ibn Serapion would hardly have omitted all mention of it. Its waters join the latter river on its left bank near the great fortress of Derendeh. If this identification of the Aivali Dereh with the River Karakis be correct, Derendeh would then represent the ancient Zibatra, unless indeed a place called Hauz (on the upper waters of the Aivali Dereh, and where remains are reported to exist) be the site of this celebrated fortress. It must be admitted, however, that neither Derendeh nor Hauz correspond very exactly, as regards position, with the indication given by Abu-l-Fid\u0101 (quoted on p. 66), who writes that Zibatra lies \"two marches southward of Malatya.\" No Arab author, however, can be relied on for anything like exact orientation of the points of the compass, and in the present case there are besides, very possibly, clerical errors of the MSS. which would account for the difficulty.\n\nIn regard to the identification of Al-Hadath with the present Gurun, I find my suggestion confirmed by what Mr. Hogarth reports of the stream which at present flows past that place. This stream is now called the Angon Tchai, and, exactly as was the case with the River J\u016brith (see pp. 63 and 67) of Ibn Serapion, the Angon Tchai flows through a small lake which is situated just above Gurun, and the stream has a long course before reaching this lake, for it rises near \u2018Azizieh, in the Uzun Yaila country. The River Al-\u2018Arj\u0101n, as described by Ibn Serapion, would then correspond very exactly with the affluent which now enters the Angon Tchai on its right bank about two miles below the said lake, and whose waters are even at the present day used to irrigate the gardens of Gurun. From what Mr. Hogarth writes it appears that this stream rises in\nthe foot-hills of the Anti-Taurus, now called the Bimboa Dagh, and these presumably are the Jabal-ar-Rish of Ibn Serapion.\n\nBefore quitting the subject of the Kub\u0101kib river, it may be pointed out that the city of Malatya of the date of Ibn Serapion, which he speaks of as standing \"two miles distant from the Euphrates\" (p. 47), does not occupy the position of the modern town of the same name; for this last lies fully eleven miles from the ancient bridge, called Kirkg\u00f6z, crossing the Tokhma Su, immediately above its junction with the Euphrates. Old Malatya is the place now called Eski-sheher \"old town,\" and this stands but four miles from the Kirkg\u00f6z Bridge, and some three miles from the nearest point of the Euphrates.\n\nIn regard to the Jabal Misf\u012bn\u0101 (see pp. 46 and 48), round whose spur the upper (western) Euphrates cuts its way, Mr. Hogarth considers that Ibn Serapion here refers to the great range lying along the south and left bank of the stream, to wit, the Darsim group\u2014not the mountains on the north bank near Arzinj\u0101n, as I have suggested. Of the Darsim group Mr. Hogarth writes: \"This is the most striking mountain on the river's course by far; and it is round its spur\u2014Hoste Beli Dagh\u2014that the Euphrates makes its great bend from a westerly course to a southerly. No one who had seen the upper stream could have failed to mention this chain of snow-peaks, which hang right over the river for five days' journey.\" The fortress called \u1e24i\u1e63n-al-Minsb\u0101r (see p. 48) I had marked near this point on my map with a query, for I was unable to find any place on the Kiepert map with which it could be identified. Mr. Hogarth, however, writes that there is a remarkable ruined fortress, which he describes as situated about fifteen hours' journey west of Kamkh, and one hour north of Ping\u0101n, the town on the left bank of the Euphrates opposite the point where the Divrigi river flows in. This fortress stands about one mile from the right (northern) bank of the Euphrates; and though no positive evidence of date could be found, Mr. Hogarth judged from the character\nof the building that it must have been of Roman or Byzantine construction, and, further, it appears to be the only fortress of ancient date in all this region. In concluding his notes, Mr. Hogarth remarks that the fortress of Kharshana, which Ibn Serapion places \"in the Greek country\" (see pp. 54 and 58), is possibly the present Alaja Kh\u0101n. This is mentioned as a remarkable ruin by both Von Moltke and Tozer, and it lies on the upper waters of the Kuru Tchai, which is the river Jarjariya of Ibn Serapion.\n\nFor the remaining notes I am indebted to Professor De Goeje; those, however, which he has sent me as corrections for the topography of Baghd\u0101d (Ibn Serapion, Sections X to XII) I for the moment shall keep back, in order not unduly to lengthen the present article, also because I hope to make Baghd\u0101d the subject of a paper in a future number of the J.R.A.S.\n\nIn my translation of the text, I have constantly supplied the proper name, in the English, for what in the Arabic is a pronoun. Thus, throughout Section V every paragraph in the Arabic begins with the words \"From it is taken,\" etc., while I have translated \"From the Euphrates,\" or \"From the Tigris,\" as I imagined the case demanded.\n\nThis has led me into a grievous error; for, though without doubt the Dujayl was only a loop canal of the west bank of the Tigris above Baghd\u0101d after the middle of the fourth century of the Hijra (A.D. 950), before this date (that is, as described by Ibn Khurd\u0101dbih and Ibn Serapion) the Dujayl was a transverse canal running from the Euphrates to the Tigris, like the Nahr '\u012as\u0101 and the canals below. Thus, Ibn Khurd\u0101dbih (p. 7), writing in A.D. 864 (A.H. 250), describes \"the lands watered by the Dujayl and the Euphrates\"; and in my translation of Ibn Serapion (p. 68, line 10 from below) I should have written: \"From the Euphrates is taken the canal called the Dujayl,\" and this, of course, changes note 2 on page 70. Ar-Rabb, on the Euphrates, is a well-known post-station lying, as already stated (vide ante, p. 743), seven leagues above\nAl-Anb\u0101r and twelve below Hit. Starting from \"a league or more\" above this point, as should be marked on my map, the Dujayl canal flows eastward and falls into the Tigris \"between 'Ukbar\u0101 and Baghd\u0101d.\" Hence on my map Ar-Rabb, on the Tigris, is to be taken out and marked instead on the Euphrates at the place just indicated. Lastly, page 70 of my paper, lines 4 and 5 from below, the words from \"The village\" down to \"geographer\" are to be erased.\n\nFrom the data here given it follows that between the years 900 and 950 A.D. (Ibn Serapion to I\u1e63takhr\u012b) the western part of the Dujayl must have fallen out of use and become silted up; for I\u1e63takhr\u012b (p. 77), writing in the middle of the tenth century A.D., says that the Dujayl starts from the Tigris immediately below Takr\u012bt: in other words, he transfers the name Dujayl to the canal which Ibn Serapion calls the Ish\u0101k\u012b (see p. 265, Section VIII, first paragraph).\n\nTurning to the last paragraph of Section VII, on p. 262, it may be noted that the MS. gives the pronunciation \u1e24i\u1e63n Kif\u0101 (not Kayfa), and this is nearer the old Greek name Kiphas; further (Professor De Goeje writes), S\u0101tidama, without the final d, is the true reading for the name of this affluent. Some distance lower down the Tigris, the three K\u0101\u1e6d\u016bl Canals branched off near the village called Barkuwa\u1e5b\u0101 (see p. 272). On this name, of which the variants Balkuwa\u1e5b\u0101 and Bazkuwa\u1e5b occur, Professor De Goeje makes the remark: \"It is strange, but certain, that often an original r passed into z. We find very often Azdashir for Ardashir, etc. The first r in this word [Barkuwa\u1e5b\u0101] is confirmed by the l [in Balkuwa\u1e5b\u0101], which could not come from a z [i.e. Balkuwa\u1e5b\u0101 could only come from Barkuwa\u1e5b\u0101, never from Bazkuwa\u1e5b\u0101]. The same interchanging of r and l is found in Hawl and Hawr\": see page 298, note 2; also cf. Tabari, iii, 1921, line 9.\n\nIn regard to the \"Blind Tigris\" (see note 1 to p. 300), Professor De Goeje gives in his glossary to the \"Tanbih\" another meaning for the word 'Avr\u0101, generally translated\n\"blind of one eye,\" which when applied to a river has, he says, the signification of \"dried up\" or \"become arid.\" Dijla-al-'Awr\u0101 would therefore be understood as the \"Arid Tigris\": taking this name from that given to the upper reach above Al-Madh\u0101r, which, since the shifting of the channel, had become waterless. The first westward canal on the Tigris estuary, called the Nahr-al-Mar\u0101h, has (on the same authority) nothing to do with the Canal of Murra, which last was derived from that of Ubulla. Hence my note 2 to p. 305 is in error; and lines 8 to 11, from the word \"appears\" down to \"Abu Bakr,\" have to be cancelled.\n\nIn the heading of Section XVI (p. 307), the word West should be East. Further, in line 2 of the same, I had substituted Al-Madh\u0101r for Al-Min\u0101r in the name of the first canal on this eastern side of the Tigris Estuary; but Professor De Goeje (and I have no doubt rightly) corrects my correction to Al-Mub\u0101rak. In the second line of the second paragraph, therefore, of this section Al-Mub\u0101rak is to be restored for [Al-Madh\u0101r]; while on the next page note 1 will have its first two lines cancelled, and in the Arabic text (p. 30, line 2) Al-Madh\u0101r has to be altered to Al-Mub\u0101rak, and note 4 to the same cancelled.\n\nThe last remark which I shall quote from Professor De Goeje relates to the place on the Ahw\u0101z estuary called Fam Dahast\u0101n, about which I was in considerable doubt (see p. 310). This place, he writes, is probably to be identified with the locality mentioned by Mu\u1e33addasi (p. 12) under the name Fam-as-Sab', and which is marked on the (native) map in the MS. of Istakhri as Fam-al-Asad, both names signifying \"the mouth of the lion.\" The true reading for the text of Ibn Serapion is perhaps \"Dah\u0101n-i-Sh\u012br,\" which, in Persian, has the same meaning as Fam-as-Sab', and doubtless the place stood at the point of origin (\"mouth\" in Persian and Arabic) of the water-way called the Lion Canal.\nART. XXIII.\u2014The Nativity of the Buddha. By Robert Chalmers.\n\nIn fulfilment of the undertaking given by me on p. 387 of the J.R.A.S. for 1894, I submit the text of an unpublished Sutta from the Majjhima Nik\u0101ya dealing with the 'marvels and mysteries' of the Buddha's nativity. Buddhaghosa's commentary on the Sutta is also given, though the absence of MSS. for collation leaves the readings in many instances far from satisfactory to me. I hope in an early number of the Journal to have an opportunity of discussing the subject-matter in the light of the Lalita Vistara and the Nid\u0101na-kath\u0101 of the J\u0101taka.\n\nACCHARIYABBHUTA-SUTTAM.\n\n(Majjhima Nik\u0101ya, No. 123.)\n\nEvam me sutam.

By Edward G. Browne, M.A., M.R.A.S.\n\nIn this article I do not propose to attempt any general classification of the dialects spoken in different parts of Persia; for, in the present state of our knowledge, and with the materials yet available, such attempt would, perhaps, be premature; and, in any case, the task is one which I am not competent to undertake. Neither do I deem it necessary to enlarge upon the importance of the philological results which a fuller study of these dialects may be expected to yield. My present intention is merely to make known a collection of poems, of various dates and authorship, composed in different dialects of the Persian language, and contained in a small manuscript which came into my possession about four years ago.\n\nI have more than once had occasion to make mention in these pages of Sheykh A\u2014\u2014, of Kirm\u00e1n, a learned B\u00e1b\u00ed of the Ezeli faction resident in Constantinople. With him I maintained for some considerable time a pretty regular correspondence on matters connected with the bibliography, literature, and religions of Western Asia. In one of my letters I questioned him as to the exact nature of the dialect in which some verses occurring in a ghazal of H\u00e1fi\u1e93 (ed. Rosenzweig-Schwannau, vol. iii, p. 226: No. 78 in \u0686) are composed. In a letter dated July 30, 1891, he replied as follows: \"The dialect about which you wrote for information is the L\u00far\u00ed patois of Sh\u00edr\u00e1z and Isfah\u00e1n, which is the Pahlav\u00ed dialect.\" Many poets, such as Sa'di,\n\n1 The term Pahlav\u00ed, as has often been pointed out, is very loosely used by later Muhammadan writers, and is commonly applied to the dialects spoken in various districts of Persia, as, for example, by Hamdu'll\u00e1h Mustawfi-i-Qazvini in the Nuzhatu'l-Qulub (A.H. 740), s.v. \u0632\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0646, \u0645\u0631\u0627\u062a\u0639, \u0645\u0631\u0627\u062a\u0639, \u0645\u0631\u0627\u062a\u0639. Cf. Olshausen's classical \"Parthava und Pahlav, M\u0101da und M\u0101h\" in the Monatsberichte der Akad. zu Berlin, 1876, p. 765.\nAb\u016b Is-h\u0101q, the gastronomic poet, H\u0101f\u012bz, and Khw\u0101j\u0101 [of Kirm\u0101n], have composed verses in it. Of these poems I have collected a sufficient sample, and have written them down with a glossary; these, if you wish, I will forward to you.\u201d\n\nIt need scarcely be said that I accepted this offer with alacrity. On September 2, 1891, I received the manuscript which I shall describe immediately, together with a letter wherein Sheykh A\u2014\u2014 wrote as follows: \u201cAs regards the L\u016br\u012b dialect of Sh\u012br\u00e1z, I have for some while entertained the idea of compiling a collection of specimens of the different dialects of Persian\u2014Kh\u016bz\u012b, L\u016br\u012b, N\u0101'in\u012b, Z\u0101vuli, Sughd\u012b, G\u012bl\u012b, Deylam\u012b, R\u0101z\u012b, etc. With a thousand difficulties, I have been successful as regards some of these, amongst which is this same L\u016br\u012b dialect. . . . . For the moment, I have transcribed a few quires on the L\u016br\u012b dialect as now used at S\u012bvand, which I herewith send you. Believe me when I tell you that it cost me nearly a year\u2019s work to prove and verify these few sheets; for to obtain from Persia information of this sort needs the strength of seven elephants. I would not have communicated it to anyone, but, by reason of my sincere friendship for you, who seek after learning and knowledge, and understand somewhat of these matters, I forward these six quires. Should you desire it, I will by degrees send you more. So likewise I have put together all that I have been able to collect about the other dialects of Persia, which also I will send you.\u201d The Sheykh added that he and several others in Constantinople and Persia had formed themselves into a small society for the study of these dialects, and the collection of illustrative material.\n\nThe mere formation of such a society, however small, however imperfectly equipped, however wanting in scientific method, is, I think, a thing worthy of note, and should tend to dissipate the notion entertained, as it would seem, by some students of Persian that there is a complete dearth of literary activity and intellectual life in modern Persia. Much might be said to prove the falsity of this notion,\nbut I have not space to pursue the matter further at present, and return to the manuscript above mentioned, which supplies the subject-matter of this article. It comprises ff. 44 (88 pp.), in six quires or \"sheets,\" measuring $20 \\times 13$ centimetres, and is written in a small, clear, Persian ta'liq. The paper is thick, and yellowish in colour. Each page is ruled in 18 lines, but the actual number of written lines varies according to the extent of the interlinear glosses, which, as well as the headings, are inserted in red ink. The contents are as follows:\n\nI (ff. 1a\u20134a). An account of S\u00edvand in F\u00e1rs (situated on the main road from Sh\u00edr\u00e1z to Isfah\u00e1n, about 3 parasangs N. of Istakhr) and its dialect.\n\nII (ff. 4a\u201316a). A glossary of dialectical words (including many of those which occur in the poems immediately following), with their Persian equivalents, arranged in 13 classes, according to subjects, without regard to alphabetical order.\n\nIII (ff. 16b\u201344a). A collection of dialectical poems (about 75 pieces in all, comprising some 390 beyts) by 16 different poets.\n\nIV (f. 44b). Remarks on the etymology of five words\n\nThree years ago (in the summer of 1892) I began to prepare an article on this manuscript, but other work compelled me to lay it aside unfinished. My intention at that time was to prefix both the text and translation of the account of S\u00edvand, which constitutes Part i of the contents, together with the glossary which forms Part ii, to the text and translation of the poems and such commentary as I could supply to them. Only, as a matter of convenience, I determined to rearrange the words in the glossary so that they should stand in alphabetical order, and to append a table of phonetic equivalents, showing the modifications which each Persian vowel and consonant might assume in the dialects. Of this abortive\narticle the whole preliminary portion, amounting to 35 pages, was actually written, when I was compelled for the while to turn my attention to other matters, hoping to resume and complete it at some future date. I was fore-stalled, however, by M. Cl\u00e9ment Huart, to whose pen we owe so many interesting and valuable communications on Persian and Turkish bibliography, Persian philology, and other matters connected with Western Asia. In the Journal Asiatique for March\u2013April, 1893 (Ser. ix, vol. i, pp. 241\u201365), he published an article entitled le Dialecte Persan de Siv\u00e9nd, in which were comprised a French translation of the account of Sivand which forms Part i of my MS, and the glossary which constitutes Part ii. In the latter he preserved the original arrangement of words according to classes. Concerning the source of this memoir he added the following particulars, not previously known to me.\n\n\"In 1888 the Governor of the province of F\u00e1rs, His Highness Prince Ihtish\u00e1mu\u2019d-Dawla [son of the late Prince Farh\u00e1d M\u00edrz\u00e1, Mu\u2019tamadu\u2019d-Dawla], hearing that the inhabitants of the village of Sivand, situated at a short distance from Sh\u00edr\u00e1z, made use amongst themselves of a special dialect, had the curiosity to instruct a Persian man of letters attached to his service to make a study of this patois. This mission was entrusted to M\u00edrz\u00e1 Huseyn T\u00edbr\u00e1n\u00ed, poetically surnamed Thureyy\u00e1, who recorded his observations in a manuscript, of which there exists a copy in the library of M\u00edrz\u00e1 H\u00e1bib of Isf\u00e1han. He, very obligingly, authorized us to make use of it. This copy was made by the caligrapher Fa\u1e0dlull\u00e1h, son of the late M\u00edrz\u00e1 Mu\u1e25ammad Y\u00fasuf, the gilder, and was completed on Thursday, the 9th of R\u00e1b\u00ed\u2018 II, A.H. 1306 (Dec. 14, 1888). It consists of 27 leaves, unnumbered, of a small size, corresponding approximately to the octodecimo of our booksellers.\"\n\nThis MS., which formed the basis of M. Huart\u2019s article, was, no doubt, the source whence Sheykh A\u2014\u2014 derived Parts i and ii of the MS. which he sent to me; for, so far, the two MSS. correspond almost exactly; and, moreover, I happen to know that the learned M\u00edrz\u00e1 H\u00e1bib (who died\ntwo or three years ago) was one of Sheykh A\u2014\u2014\u2019s intimate friends. A comparison of M. Huart\u2019s translation of M\u00edrz\u00e1 Huseyn\u2019s Memoir on S\u00edvand with the text in my MS. reveals only a few quite trivial differences; while my vocabulary differs from his chiefly in this, that with it have been incorporated some additional dialect-words drawn from the poems. This cannot be regarded as altogether an improvement, since the poems differ in age, authorship, and idiom, and it is obviously undesirable to confound the words occurring in them with those actually used at present in the S\u00edvand dialect. The publication of M. Huart\u2019s article, therefore, renders it unnecessary for me to say much more about the first two parts of my MS. The English translation of the memoir on S\u00edvand which I had prepared is no longer of any use, since the excellent French rendering of M. Huart is accessible to all in the pages of the Journal Asiatique. Nor do I now think that the publication of the original Persian text of this memoir, which I had originally contemplated, is of much importance; since most of the place-names occurring in it (for which especially the text might be deemed necessary) are given by M. Huart in the proper character. As for the vocabulary, although I still consider an alphabetical arrangement preferable to the existing one, it does not appear to me to be worth reprinting the same series of words with the same explanations merely for the sake of introducing a better order.\n\nBesides the text and translation of the memoir mentioned above, I had constructed for my abortive article a Table of Phonetic Equivalents, wherein I endeavoured to sum up in a compendious form such phenomena of permutation of sound as were revealed by comparison of the dialects in which these poems are written with standard Persian, so far as the intrinsic unfitness (for such a purpose) of the Arabic alphabet, and the transcriber\u2019s lack of scientific method, permit us to observe them. This table, somewhat modified from its original form, I here subjoin, for, imperfect though it be, it offers a summary of the more salient features of these dialects, and indicates, to some extent, the\nrelations existing between them and standard Persian. Each phonetic change recorded in this table will henceforth be denoted by the numeral here prefixed to it.\n\nTABLE OF PHONETIC EQUIVALENTS.\n\nI. Vowels.\n\n1. \u00e1 (\u0622) is shortened to a; e.g. \u0622\u0641\u062a\u0627\u0628 for \u062a\u0627\u0628\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646.\n2. ,, becomes \u00fa (\u0648), u; e.g. \u0622\u0633\u06cc\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0646 for \u0631\u0646 for \u0631\u0627\u0646.\n3. ,, becomes i, i; e.g. \u062f\u0631\u0645\u06cc\u0646 for \u0622\u0646 for \u0627\u06cc\u0646.\n4. ,, (medial) becomes \u00e9; e.g. \u06a9\u0647\u06af\u0644 for \u06a9\u0647\u06af\u0644.\n5. a (rarely) becomes i; e.g. \u0646\u0645\u06a9 for \u0646\u0645\u06cc\u06a9.\n6. Prosthetic i (\u0627) is common in the dialects; e.g. \u0627\u0634\u06a9\u0627\u0644 for \u0633\u067e\u06cc\u062f\u0622\u0628 for \u0627\u0633\u067e\u06cc\u062f\u0648 \u0634\u063a\u0627\u0644.\n7. i, i (id\u00e1fat) is replaced by \u00e1; e.g. \u0648\u0644\u0627\u0633\u06cc\u0631\u0647 for \u06af\u0644 \u0633\u0631\u062e for \u062a\u0648\u0631\u062a \u0641\u0631\u0646\u06af\u06cc for \u062a\u06cc\u0627 \u0641\u0631\u0646\u06af\u06cc.\n8. i is shortened to \u00ed; e.g. \u0634\u06cc\u0631\u06cc\u0646 for \u0634\u06cc\u0631\u06cc\u0646.\n9. i (medial) becomes ih; e.g. \u062a\u06cc\u0631\u0647 for \u062a\u06cc\u0631\u0647.\n10. \u00fa is shortened to u; e.g. \u06af\u0648\u0634 for \u06af\u0648\u0634.\n11. u is lengthened to \u00fa; e.g. \u06a9\u0646\u062f for \u06a9\u0648\u0646\u0647.\n12. u, \u00fa, become \u00ed; e.g. \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0647 for \u0634\u0631\u062e \u0622\u0647\u06cc for \u0622\u0647\u0648.\n13. \u00fa (final) becomes \u00e9 (\u0648); e.g. \u0648 for \u062a\u0648. [Perhaps, however, \u062a\u064e pointed \u062a\u064f merely denotes a shortening of the vowel, as in 10.

Thus, as is well known, \u00e1 is in many words pronounced as \u00fa or u (e.g. \u0646\u0627\u0646, n\u00e1n, not n\u00e1n; \u0645\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0646, mundan, not m\u00e1ndan or m\u00fandan; \u0622\u0646\u062c\u0627, anj\u00e1, not \u00e1nja or \u00fanj\u00e1; but, on the other hand, \u062c\u0627\u0646, j\u00e1n, kh\u00e1n, seldom or never j\u00fan, kh\u00fan). So likewise, in rapid speaking, the final d of the 3rd person singular of the aorist\nis often dropped (na-mir\u00e9' for na-mirad; cf. my Year amongst the Persians, p. 119); ast is shortened to a, \u00e9; and such pronunciations as nami-shad for nami-shavad, mi-giyad for mi-guyad, i for in, and the like, are commonly heard even in the speech of educated persons. But these current pronunciations are, as above said, concealed by the stereotyped orthography of the literary language; and it is only when an attempt is made to represent in writing a provincial idiom, as, for instance, where a G\u00edl\u00e1n\u00ed peasant is introduced into the amusing dialogue of the Vazir of Lankur\u00e1n (edited by Haggard and le Strange), or in the so-called \u0641\u0647\u0644\u0648\u06cc\u0627\u062a (\"Pahlav\u00ed verses\") of the dialect poets, that they come to light. Once having made up his mind to deviate from the normal orthography, however, it seems as though the Persian scribe endeavoured, as a rule, to make this deviation as great as possible, by substituting \u0633 for \u0635, \u062a for \u0628, and the like, although no distinction is made between these letters in pronunciation even in standard Persian.\u00b9 From what has been said it follows that the difference between the pronunciation of the dialects and that of standard Persian is, on the whole, less than we should suppose if we were to judge from written specimens alone.\n\nI use the words \"attempt to represent in writing a provincial idiom\" advisedly; for not only does the Arabic character, especially when unpointed, afford a very imperfect means of representing graphically the finer shades of pronunciation, but every scribe, when he has to do with dialects not used for literary purposes, where he has no fixed rule to guide him, employs his own system, and is usually not consistent even in that. It is bad enough when the scribe is thoroughly familiar with the dialect which he wishes to express in writing, and far worse when (as is generally the case) we have to deal with copies, more or\n\n\u00b9 As it is always well to have native evidence for such a statement, I may refer to p. 3 of Mirz\u00e1 Habib's Dav\u00far-i-Sukhun (Constantinople, A.H. 1289), where it is explicitly stated that the Persians pronounce \u062a and \u0635 exactly like \u0647, \u0641 and \u0628 like \u062c, \u0644 like \u0648, and \u063a like \u0644.\nless remote from the original draft, made by persons ignorant of the dialect before them, into which all sorts of clerical errors are almost sure to have crept. It is, indeed, evident that a really satisfactory study of a dialect can only be made by a scientific observer, skilled in Phonetics, who enjoys prolonged opportunities of conversing with persons who speak it naturally; and in the case of some at any rate of the poets who have written occasional verses in one or other of the dialects of Persia we cannot even feel confident that they were masters of the idiom in which they strove to express themselves. A very poor and inaccurate imitation of the peculiarities of speech of a Lur, for instance, might serve to amuse an educated Persian, just as an English audience will laugh at the fictitious brogue of an actor who may never even have set foot on Irish ground, and whose utterances, not modelled on any one dialect, are a mere travesty of certain striking features of Irish pronunciation in general.\n\nThe above considerations again and again almost decided me to abandon a task which, by reason of its intrinsic difficulty, the inadequate materials at my disposal, and my own imperfect qualifications, it seemed presumptuous to attempt. But, on the other hand, it seemed to me important to direct the attention of Persian students in this country to the existence of this considerable mass of dialect poetry, which hitherto has in England received but little attention; and, moreover, I have learned by experience that the publication of even a very faulty and imperfect account of a matter which is interesting in itself often suffices to elicit from other workers in the same field valuable communications and criticisms which might otherwise never be made. So, though it is disagreeable to one's self to turn out work which, notwithstanding all one's efforts, bears on itself to the last the stamp of manifold imperfection and incompleteness, I have finally decided to print as specimens a few of the poems which constitute the third (and chief) part of the manuscript above described, together with such commentary as I am able to add from\nthe notes and glosses of the compiler and other sources. The English renderings which I give must, in some cases, be regarded as rather of a tentative character, though I believe that they fairly represent the general sense of the poems.\n\nBefore proceeding further, it will be convenient for me to enumerate some of the principal published notices and studies of Persian dialects (to most of which I have had access), and the abbreviations wherewith I shall henceforth denote those of them to which I may have occasion to refer in the course of this article. This list makes no pretensions whatever to completeness, and includes monographs only, though valuable material is to be gleaned from a good many books of travel, etc. (such as Polak's Persien, Chodzko's Mem. sur l'Asie Centrale, etc.), which contain incidental allusions to the dialects of different parts of Persia. In the case of Kurdish, on which a good deal has been written, I mention only a few of the principal contributions of philologists. Fuller information will be found by those who desire it in the introduction prefixed by Justi to his edition of Jaba's Dictionnaire Kurde-Fran\u00e7ais (St. Pet., 1879, pp. xii-xviii), and in other monographs.\n\n1840-1850.

Shukovski\u2019s \u201cMaterials for the study of the Persian dialects.\u201d Unfortunately this book, which is by far the most important contribution\nyet made on the subject, is written in Russian, so that to those who, like myself, are unfortunate enough to be ignorant of that language, only the texts included in it (transliterated, for the most part, in Russian characters) are of any use. The following particulars concerning M. Shukovski's valuable researches are derived from M. C. Salemann's *compte-rendu* to the *Acad\u00e9mie Imp\u00e9riale de St. P\u00e9tersbourg* (Feb. 3, 1887; *Bulletin de l'Acad.*, vol. xxxi, pp. 537\u201340). M. Shukovski spent three years (1883\u201386) in Persia, during which period he studied eleven different dialects, grouped as follows:\n\nI. *Shir\u00e1z* district: dialects of *Sirvand* and *Abdu* (20\u201330 versts S. of Shir\u00e1z), with its dependencies *Kel\u00fcn* and *P\u00f3pun*.\n\nII. *K\u00e1sh\u00e1n* district: dialects of *V\u00f3nish\u00fan*, *Qohrud*, *Kesh\u00e9*, and *Zefr\u00e9*.\n\nIII. *Semn\u00e1n-T\u00edhr\u00e1n* district: dialects of *Sengiser* and *Shemerg\u00f3d*.\n\nIV. *Isfah\u00e1n* district: dialects of *Se-deh*, *Gaz*, and *Kafr\u00f3n*.\n\nIn all these dialects he obtained translations of the \"Bacmeister'sche Sprachproben,\" the beginning of the \"Finnic Rune,\" the parable of the Prodigal Son, and twelve stories from the *\u0645\u06cc\u062b\u0627\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0645\u06cc\u0634 \u0648 \u0637\u0631\u06cc\u0642\u0647*. In the dialects of *Qohrud*, *Kesh\u00e9*, *Zefr\u00e9*, and *Se-deh* he also obtained versions of popular Persian songs which pass current in those districts; and in the dialects of *Kafr\u00f3n*, *Zefr\u00e9*, and *Gaz*, a rich store of verses by indigenous poets. Besides all this, he brought back a large collection of *Bakhtiy\u00e1ri* songs, and some specimens of the (Kurdish) dialect spoken by the *Kulkh\u00e1ni* branch of the *K\u00fazievend*. This vast accumulation of valuable material, with grammatical sketches,\nvocabularies, and other necessary adjuncts, is to form five volumes, of which I only possess the first (dealing with the K\u00e1sh\u00e1n group of dialects), published in 1888. Whether the remaining volumes, or any of them, have yet appeared, I have hitherto been unable to ascertain.\n\n1889. [Hu. 3] = Cl. Huart's \"Notice d'un manuscrit Pehlevi-Musulman,\" etc., in the Jour. As., xiv, pp. 238-70. I have succeeded in identifying the MS. described in this article with the J\u00e1vid\u00e1n-i-Kabir (\u062c\u0627\u0648\u06cc\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u0628\u06cc\u0631), a heretical book on the doctrines of the \u1e24ur\u00faf\u00ed sect of the Isma'iliyya composed by its founder, Fa\u1e0dlu 'll\u00e1h b. Ab\u00ed Mu\u1e25ammad et-Tabr\u00edz\u00ed el-\u1e24ur\u00faf\u00ed, who was put to death in A.H. 804 (A.D. 1401-2) by T\u00edm\u00far. A full description of a manuscript of the same work contained in the Cambridge University Library, and bearing the class-mark Ee. 1. 27, will appear at pp. 69-86 of my forthcoming Catalogue of our Persian MSS. The value of this MS. of ours is largely increased by the careful interlinear glosses which have been supplied to most of the dialectical portions.\n\n1893. [Hu. 4] = Cl. Huart's \"Dialecte persan de Siw\u00e9nd,\" in the Jour. As., i, pp. 241-65, to which I have already had occasion to refer (p. 776 supra). I ascertained from M. Huart, whom I had the pleasure of meeting at Geneva in September, 1894, that M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u1e24ab\u00edb's manuscript, which formed the basis of his article, contained only the first and second parts of my manuscript, and not the poems which I am about to communicate. This present article may therefore be regarded as in some sense complementary to his.\nThe Authors of the Poems.\n\nAs already stated, the verses contained in my manuscript amount to about 390 beyts, and are ascribed, in very unequal proportions, to 16 different poets. These I shall now enumerate in alphabetical order, adding such particulars about each (save those who are too well known to need any further notice) as I have been able to collect.\n\n1. Ab\u00fa Is-h\u00e1q (Bus-h\u00e1q) of Sh\u00edr\u00e1z, the wool-carder (hall\u00e1j) and gastronomic poet, author of the Div\u00e1n-i-at'\u00edma, Kansu'l-ishtih\u00e1, etc. He died (see Rieu's Persian Catalogue, p. 634) in A.H. 819 or 827. Notices of his life and poems are given by Dawlatsh\u00e1h (Bombay lith. ed. of 1887, pp. 160-63) and in the \u00c1'tash-Kada (Bombay lith. ed. of A.H. 1277, poets of Sh\u00edr\u00e1z, s.v. \u0628\u06cc\u0633\u062a). An excellent edition of his works, printed by Ebu'd-Diy\u00e1 Tevf\u00edq Bey, appeared at Constantinople in A.H. 1303, with a preface by M\u00edrz\u00e1 H\u00e1d\u00edb (cf. Journal Asiatique 8, viii, pp. 182-6, and ibid. 8, xi, pp. 88-90). This edition contains a few of the poems in dialect (called \u0646\u0647\u0631\u0648\u06cc\u0627\u062a). Complete MSS. of Ab\u00fa Ish\u00e1q's poems are very rare. One, bearing the class-mark L. 137, and dated A.H. 970, is, or was till recently, in the possession of the Society for the Propagation of Christianity amongst the Jews. It was given to Dr. Wolff in A.H. 1234 by a certain H\u00e1d\u00ed 'Othm\u00e1n N\u00faru'd-D\u00edn. It is considerably fuller than the printed edition, with which I was fortunate enough to be able to collate it in part, and contains many more verses in dialect. In the colophon with which this MS. concludes the poet's name is given as Fakhru'd-D\u00edn Ahmad. It is written in a small, neat ta'l\u00edq between blue and gold lines, and comprises ff. 162 of 22\u00b74 x 12\u00b77 centimetres and 17 lines. A notice of Ab\u00fa Is-h\u00e1q is also given by Rid\u00e1-qul\u00ed Kh\u00e1n at pp. 44-5 of\nhis *Riy\u00e1du'l-'\u00c1rif\u00edn* (T\u00edhr\u00e1n lith. ed. A.H. 1305). It is there stated that his name was Sheykh Ahmad, his *kunya* Ab\u00fa Is-h\u00e1q (which, in his *takhallus*, he shortened to *Bus-h\u00e1q*), and his nickname *At'ima*; and that he was personally acquainted with Sh\u00e1h Ni'matu'll\u00e1h of Kirm\u00e1n (d. A.H. 834). Twenty of his poems are cited in my MS.\n\n2. *'Al\u00ed* (*Mirz\u00e1* \u2014\u2014) of Soh (two stages from K\u00e1sh\u00e1n and one from Qohrud, to the S.). I have hitherto been unable to identify this poet, and can give no particulars about him. One only of his poems is cited.\n\n3. *'Al\u00ed Rid\u00e1* (*Mulla* \u2014\u2014) of Behbeh\u00e1n may perhaps be identified with the *M\u00edrz\u00e1 'Al\u00ed Ri\u1e0d\u00e1 Tajall\u00e1* mentioned in the *\u00c1tash-Kada* amongst the poets of F\u00e1rs (*cf.* Eth\u00e9's *Catalogue*, col. 284, No. 651), although the latter is described as a native of Ardak\u00e1n (about 40 miles N.W. of Yezd). According to the *\u00c1tash-Kada*, this *'Al\u00ed Rid\u00e1* was a pupil of *Aq\u00e1 Huseyn Kh\u00fans\u00e1n\u00ed*, who, again, is stated (*cf.* Eth\u00e9, *loc. cit.* col. 277, No. 434) to have lived in the reign of Sh\u00e1h Suleym\u00e1n the Safav\u00ed (A.H. 1077\u20131105; A.D. 1667\u20131694). The identification, however, is doubtful. Eight of his poems are cited.\n\n4. *B\u00e1b\u00e1 T\u00e1hir 'Ury\u00e1n* of Hamad\u00e1n, author of the celebrated quatrains, published, with French translation and philological notes, by M. Cl. Huart in 1885 in the *Journal Asiatique* vi, pp. 502\u201345. These quatrains, together with those of 'Omar Khayy\u00e1m and Ab\u00fa Sa'id b. Abi 'l-Khayr, and other poems, were also published in lithograph by *M\u00edrz\u00e1 Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u00edr\u00e1z\u00ed* at Bombay in A.H. 1297. The *\u00c1tash-Kada*, which fills a page with his poems, gives no hint of his date; but *Rid\u00e1-qul\u00ed Kh\u00e1n* (*Riy\u00e1du'l-'\u00c1rif\u00edn*, ed. T\u00edhr\u00e1n, A.H. 1305, p. 102) states that he died in A.H. 410 (A.D. 1019\u201320), *\u0645\u064f\u0631 \u062c\u064e\u0647\u0627\u0631 \u0635\u062f \u0648 \u0633\u0650\u0628\u0652\u0639\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e\u060c* and\nthat consequently he cannot have been a contemporary of 'Aynu'l-Qud\u00e1t-i-Hamad\u00e1n\u00ed (d. A.H. 525 or 526, according to H\u00e1j\u00ed Khalfa, iii, pp. 459, 536; cf. also J\u00e1m\u00ed's Nafah\u00e1t, pp. 475\u201377) or Na\u1e63\u00edru'd-D\u00edn T\u00fasi (d. A.H. 672), as stated by some writers. Unfortunately Rid\u00e1-qul\u00ed Kh\u00e1n does not cite his authority for this early date, which would make B\u00e1b\u00e1 T\u00e1hir a contemporary of Fir-daws\u00ed. Twenty-four quatrains are cited.\n\n5. H\u00e1fi\u1e93 of Sh\u00edr\u00e1z (d. A.H. 791) is too well known to need further notice here. One poem cited.\n\n6. His\u00e1b\u00ed may with some probability be identified with the M\u00edrz\u00e1 Salm\u00e1n His\u00e1b\u00ed of Natanz, mentioned in the \u00c1tash-Kada amongst the poets of Isfah\u00e1n, since Natanz is well known to be the stronghold of a peculiar dialect of Persian (cf. Eth\u00e9's Catalogue, col. 275, No. 372). One poem cited.\n\n7. Jal\u00e1l-i-\u1e6cab\u00edb (\"the physician\") is probably identical with the Jal\u00e1lu'd-D\u00edn-i-\u1e6cab\u00edb mentioned by Dawlatsh\u00e1h (Bombay lith. ed. of A.D. 1887, pp. 129\u201330), who states that he flourished in F\u00e1rs under the patronage of the Mu\u1e93\u1e93afarids, and that in A.H. 734 (=A.D. 1333\u201334) he published a poem called Gul u Naer\u00fas which achieved great celebrity. One poem cited.\n\n8. Mahm\u00fad b. Amir A\u1e25mad Ni\u1e93\u00e1m Q\u00e1ri of Yezd, the poet of clothes, as Ab\u00fa Is-h\u00e1q was of foods. His Div\u00e1n-i-albisa (uniform with Ab\u00fa Is-h\u00e1q's Div\u00e1n-i-a\u1e6d\u012bma), edited by M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u1e24ab\u00edb of Isfah\u00e1n, was printed at Constantinople in A.H. 1304 by Ab\u00fa'd-Diy\u00e1 Tevf\u00edq Bey. The editor states in his preface that, saving a pretty full notice which he remembers to have seen in an old Indian tadhkira (not named), and one citation amongst the shaw\u00e1hid of the Burh\u00e1n-i-J\u00e1m\u00ed\" of Mu\u1e25ammad Kar\u00edm b. Mahd\u00ed-qul\u00ed of Tabr\u00edz (lith. ed. Tabr\u00edz, A.H. 1260), he has been unable, after the most diligent search, to find any notice of this poet. His edition was\nbased on a single MS. in his own possession, concerning the date and condition of which, unfortunately, he gives no particulars. Useful glossaries of the technical terms used by the poet of clothes and the poet of foods have been appended by the learned editor to their respective d\u00edv\u00e1ns. All that he says about the date of the former is that he outlived the latter, whose D\u00edv\u00e1n-i-at'im\u00e1 served him for a model, and whom, in his preface, he speaks of as deceased. If, however (as appears probable), our poet be identical with the Mir Ni\u1e93\u00e1mu'd-D\u00edn-Q\u00e1rt\u00ed of K\u00e1sh\u00e1n, mentioned by Taqi'u'd-D\u00edn K\u00e1sh\u00ed in the Kh\u00e1t\u00edma of his Khul\u00e1satu'l-ash'\u00e1r (see Pertsch's Berlin Catalogue, pp. 611\u201315), he must have been alive in A.H. 993 (A.D. 1585), since the Kh\u00e1t\u00edma deals only with the biographer's contemporaries, and was composed in that year. One poem cited.\n\n9. Mu\u1e25ammad \u0160\u00fafi. A Mull\u00e1 Mu\u1e25ammad, who wrote under the takhallus of \u0160\u00fafi, is mentioned in the \u0100'tash-Kada (ed. Bombay, A.H. 1277, p. 170) amongst the poets of Isfah\u00e1n. \"Some persons,\" adds the biographer, \"consider him to have been the maternal uncle of Mull\u00e1 J\u00e1m\u00ed\" (d. A.H. 898 = A.D. 1492\u201393), \"but God knows best.\" Two poems cited.\n\n10. Nadhr\u00ed Sh\u00e1h Rid\u00e1'\u00edt. A Mull\u00e1 Nadhr\u00ed of K\u00e1sh\u00e1n and several Rid\u00e1'\u00eds are mentioned in the Suhuf-i-Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm\u00ed (Pertsch's Berlin Catalogue, No. 663), but in the absence of further particulars I cannot even attempt an identification. Two quatrains cited.\n\n11. 'Obeyd-i-Z\u00e1k\u00e1n\u00ed (d. A.H. 772 = A.D. 1370\u201371), the celebrated satirist, a contemporary of Salm\u00e1n of S\u00e1va. See Ouseley's Notices of Persian Poets, pp. 125\u201328; Eth\u00e9's Catalogue, cols. 572\u201373; Sprenger's Catalogue, p. 527; \u0100'tash-Kada (amongst the poets of Qazv\u00edn, of which Z\u00e1k\u00e1n is a suburb);\nDawlatsh\u00e1h (ed. Bombay, A.D. 1887, pp. 125-27). Selections from his writings (chiefly the Hazaliyy\u00e1t) were published at Constantinople, at the printing-press of Ab\u00fa\u2019d-Diy\u00e1 Tevf\u00edq Bey in A.H. 1303, with an introduction (in Persian) purporting to be my M. Fert\u00e9. His \"Cat and Mouse\" (Mush-u-Gurba) has been lithographed at Bombay at the Ma\u1e6dba\u2018i-Haydari (no date). He excelled in parody, and is generally amusing, though often extremely ribald. His Akhl\u00e1qu\u2019l-Ashr\u00e1f (\"Ethics of the Aristocracy\"), which occupies pp. 7-31 of the Constantinople edition, affords a good example of his bitter and ironical wit. Two poems cited.\n\n12. Pind\u00e1r-i-R\u00e1zi (Kam\u00e1lu\u2019d-D\u00edn). Notices of this ancient poet are given by Dawlatsh\u00e1h\u00b9 (pp. 23-24), in the \u0100tash-Kada (where he occupies the second place amongst the poets of Rey), and in Rid\u00e1-qul\u00ed Kh\u00e1n\u2019s Riy\u00e1\u1e0du\u2019l-\u2018Arif\u00edn (pp. 173-74). From these accounts it appears that he was originally from the mountainous country near Rey (\u062a\u06cc\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0631\u06cc); that he was the panegyrist of the Deylamite prince Ab\u00fa T\u00e1l\u00edb Rustam Majdu\u2019d-Dacla b. Fakhru\u2019d-Dawla (A.D. 997-1029); that he was a pupil of Abu\u2019l-Q\u00e1sim Isma\u2018il b. \u2018Abb\u00e1d [et-T\u00e1liq\u00e1n\u00ed, commonly called] \u201ce\u1e63-S\u00e1hi\u1e25\u201d (d. A.H. 385=A.D. 995); that his talent was highly rated by Z\u00e1hir of F\u00e1ry\u00e1b (d. A.H. 598); and that he wrote in Arabic, Persian, and the Deylam\u00ed dialect. Six poems cited.\n\n13. P\u00far-i-Ferid\u00fan is mentioned in the \u0100tash-Kada amongst the poets of F\u00e1rs, without further particulars, save that he wrote chiefly in the dialect of Rey. Two quatrains cited, both given, with slight variants, in the \u0100tash-Kada.\n\n14. Sheykh R\u00faz-bah\u00e1n of Shiraz. J\u00e1m\u00ed, who consecrates a notice of three pages to him in the Nafah\u00e1t\n\n\u00b9 Cf. also Quatrem\u00e8re, Journal des Savants for 1840, p. 413; and Olshausen, Monatsberichte d. k. Preuss. Akad. for 1876, p. 765.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1895.\n(pp. 288\u201390), gives his name as Ab\u00fa Mu\u1e25ammad b. Ab\u00ed Na\u1e63r el-Baqli of F\u00e1s\u00e1 in F\u00e1rs, and enumerates several of his works, such as the \u2018Ar\u00e1\u2019i\u0161u\u2019l-Bey\u00e1n (see H\u00e1j\u00ed Khalfa, iv, p. 195, No. 8105; and pp. 717\u201318 of the old Arabic Catalogue of the British Museum), and a Commentary on the Shathiyy\u00e1t, on account of which he is often called (e.g. in the A\u2019tash-Kada, section on the poets of F\u00e1rs, and in the Riy\u00e1du\u2019l-\u2018A\u2019rif\u00edn, p. 79) \u201cSheykh-i-Shatt\u00e1h.\u201d He is better known as a \u1e62\u00faf\u00ed than as a poet.

Sometimes only one or two dialectical words are glossed, and sometimes the interlinear spaces are left blank altogether. To save room, I shall first give the text of each poem cited, and then so much of the compiler\u2019s interlinear explanations as appears necessary, together with my own remarks and criticisms. So far as possible, I shall also specify the metre in which each poem is written, and give a translation of it. The order in which the poems are given in the MS. is disregarded, but the page at which each occurs is indicated.

A. evidently takes ba-v\u00e1di as from the dialectical v\u00e1-t-, v\u00e1j-, 'speech' (r\u00f3t-run in Gabr\u00ed='to speak,' and the root, as M. Huart repeatedly points out, is characteristic of all these dialects). In the explanation of 22a, S. and A. agree, except that S. takes the i in va-i-rah as=yak, and A. as=tn, both of which seem to me possible. In 23, on the other hand, S\u00fad\u00ed, not understanding the proper meaning of \u067e\u06cc\u0645\u0627\u0686\u0627\u0646 [=Pers. \u067e\u06cc\u0627\u0645\u0686\u0627\u0646], has gone altogether astray.

'place where the shoes are removed'], 'row of shoes' [i.e. the lowest part of the room, beyond the carpet, where visitors remove their shoes on entering; the least honourable place, where people of the humbler sort stand]. There is a custom prevalent amongst the Lurs that when anyone has committed a fault he fills his shoes with sand, hangs them about his neck, and stands at the threshold seeking pardon and forgiveness; wherefore H\u00e1d\u00edz says, 'We will do penance at the threshold, etc.'\"\n\nThe word in its normal form p\u00e1-m\u00e1ch\u00e1n occurs in the Mathnawi of Jal\u00e1l\u00fa'd-D\u00edn R\u00fam\u00ed (Const. ed. of Bk. i, A.H. 1288, p. 66, l. 20), in the following verse\u2014\n\n\"\u0622\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u0632 \u0641\u0631\u062f\u0648\u0633 \u0648\u0627\u0632 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0627\u06cc \u0647\u0641\u062a\u060c \u067e\u0627\u06cc \u0645\u0627\u062c\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0632 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0639\u0630\u0631 \u0631\u0641\u062a\u0647\u060c\"\n\n\"From Paradise and from beyond the Seven [Heavens or Planets] Adam went to make his excuses at the p\u00e1-m\u00e1ch\u00e1n.\"\n\nThe explanation given in the Turkish Comm. of S\u00e1ri 'Abdu'll\u00e1h Efend\u00ed (Const., A.H. 1288, vol. ii, p. 372) differs somewhat from that above quoted, and the custom alluded to is ascribed to schools and to the dervish-orders.

I, III, IV, and V), which together comprise only 10 lines. Of texts based on a single modern manuscript great suspicion may reasonably be entertained, much more so when, as in this case, the idiom in which they are conceived is one with which the copyist (perhaps even a series of copyists) was at any rate not very familiar. Some may even be disposed to feel grave doubts as to the genuineness of many of the poems, and to ask, \"Have we, save in the case of the four pieces above mentioned, any positive proof that we are dealing with verses in real dialects, composed by the poets to whom they are here ascribed, and not with ingenious forgeries, wherein forms actually occurring in the dialects are mingled with arbitrary distortions of the standard speech?\"\n\nIt is especially with the view of meeting such doubts as this that I conclude these extracts with one of Ab\u00fa Is-h\u00e1q's poems which is contained in the Wolff MS. written in A.H. 970 (=A.D. 1562\u201363; see p. 787 supra) as well as in my own. It is also given at pp. 43\u20134 of the Constantinople edition of Ab\u00fa Is-h\u00e1q's works (A.H. 1303); but, as it is quite possible that the editor used the same\nsources as my correspondent Sheykh A\u2014\u2014, this fact is of less importance. I shall not attempt to translate this piece, firstly, because I find the dialect in which it is written exceptionally difficult; and secondly, because it abounds in words appertaining to an obsolete culinary terminology which seems often to have baffled even the learned editor. My object in printing it is to show that an old MS. (written not more than a century and a half after the poet's death), to which neither the compiler of the collection of verses contained in my MS., nor the editor of Bus-h\u00e1q's poems, could, so far as I can see, have had access (since it passed into Dr. Wolff's possession in A.H. 1234=A.D. 1818-19), justifies the MS. communicated to me by Sheykh A\u2014\u2014 in the case of a singularly difficult poem from a very rare div\u00e1n.\u00b9 It is worth noting that as regards some of the most extraordinary and suspicious forms (e.g. \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0633\u062a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0633\u062a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0633\u062a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0633\u062a) entire agreement reigns; and this, I think, goes to prove that some care has been taken by the copyists not to introduce arbitrary changes, even where the temptation to do so was greatest, and establishes a strong presumption in favour of the genuineness and comparative correctness of the other poems.\n\nOf this poem, then, I shall combine the three texts before me as well as I can, choosing in each case what seems to me the better reading, but recording also all the variants, save variations in the order and arrangement of the lines, which, for my present purpose, I deem to be of no great importance. I call my MS. (Sheykh A\u2014\u2014's) A.; the Constantinople printed text C.; and the Wolff MS. W.\n\n\u00b9 Several other poems by the same author given in my MS. occur also in the Wolff MS. and in the printed edition, but lack of space compels me to withhold them for the present. The specimen cited fairly indicates the extent of divergence between the different texts.\nNo. XII.

They only amount to about one-fifth of the total number of verses comprised in my MS., which contains as many separate pieces as I have given lines. It is to me a matter of regret that I have not been able to give at least one sample from the verses of each poet represented in this collection, but I was influenced in my choice by other considerations which rendered this impossible.\n\nI began with an apology, and with an apology I must conclude. I cannot flatter myself that the texts which I here print will in themselves prove of much value. For the dialects still in use we need such researches as those of M. Shukovski, investigations conducted on the spot, amongst populations who speak them naturally, by skilled observers, capable of recognizing and recording each nuance of sound. But we need to know further what modifications these dialects have undergone in course of time, and to trace them back as far as possible; and here we are necessarily dependent on written specimens. I have attempted to show that a continuous series of poets, ranging in date\nfrom the time of Firdaws\u00ed to the present day, that is to say, over a period of nearly nine centuries, have composed in different dialects verses of which some have been preserved to us. Careful search through different *dic\u00e1ns* and *tadhkir\u00e1s* would doubtless enable us to emend and correct texts already known to us, and to supplement them by new ones. All authorities, from the celebrated Ibnu'l-Moqaffa', who died not much more than a century after the Arab conquest of Persia, down to the most recent lexicographers, mention three idioms (*P\u00e1rsi*, *Pahlav\u00ed*, and *Dari*) used in Persia for literary purposes. What precisely these writers mean by the two last of these terms\u2014especially the last\u2014is a large and a vexed question into which I do not propose to enter here; neither can I discuss at present the ingenious views propounded on the subject by M. Huart. This much, however, seems to me almost certain: that many archaic forms and words lost to standard Persian are preserved in the dialects; that some at least of the dialects are the lineal descendents, not of old Persian, but of the Avestic language;\u00b9 and that others maintain in a remarkable manner some of the peculiar constructions which distinguish Middle Persian, or Pahlav\u00ed, from the Modern, or Post-Muhammadan idiom.\n\nWhat we most need for a study of the dialects in their earlier forms is the publication of connected texts of known date and authorship, such as are found in the *J\u00e1rid\u00e1n-i-Kab\u00edr* alluded to at p. 786 *supra*. The publication of the G\u00far\u00e1n poems preserved in the British Museum is also much to be desired. Careful search would undoubtedly reveal the existence, even in comparatively old MSS., of verses and other fragments composed in dialect. M. Schefer lately called my attention to the existence of such verses in an old MS. history of the Selj\u00faqs contained in his incomparable collection, which dated, if I remember aright, from the thirteenth or fourteenth century of our era. Even in old Arabic writers whole sentences of Persian are occasionally cited which present many features of interest, and\n\n\u00b9 Cf. Chodzko, *op. laud.*, pp. 453\u201362, 465\u201366.\nwhich are not of such dubious authenticity as the \"Imr\u016bt ham\u012bn vas\u0113\" (\"This is enough for you to-day\") which the Persian lexicographers delight to adduce as proof that 'Al\u012b could converse with the faithful Salm\u0101n, the converted Magian, in his own tongue. Here are materials, as it seems to me, wherewith we may hope to bridge, at least in part, the gulfs which still exist in our knowledge of the history and developments of the Persian language.\nART. XXV.\u2014Arabic Inscriptions in Egypt. By Henry C. Kay.\n\nI.\n\nOn the occasion of a visit to Egypt last winter, I occupied myself in copying some of the inscriptions in the old graveyard of Assuan (Asw\u0101n, or Usw\u0101n)\u2014as many, that is to say, as the limited time at my disposal would permit.\n\nMany stones have of late years been removed, but large numbers remain, bearing witness to the once flourishing condition of the old frontier town. Under the protection of the garrison, an Arab settlement formed itself on the spot soon after the Muhammadan conquest of Egypt, and its members, besides employing themselves in agriculture, carried on an active trade with their southern neighbours, deriving also a not unimportant source of wealth, from their relations with the workers of the gold and emerald mines, in the neighbouring country of the Bujahs. Makrizi makes special mention of the prosperity which the citizens of Assuan enjoyed in those days, and, in illustration, quotes from a native historian an incident which occurred in the middle of the third century of the Hijrah. An Arab adventurer, Abu \u2018Abd ar-Rahman al-\u2018Omari, had contrived to establish his supremacy over the people of the gold mines. Their numbers had rapidly grown and were now largely composed of Arabs, who had flocked to the mines on the conclusion of the war between the Bujahs and the troops sent against them by the Khalifah al-Mutawakkil in A.H. 241.\u00b9 The Arabs, it may be added,\n\n\u00b9 See Tabari, ser. iii, pp. 1428\u201333.\nentered into terms of friendship with the native inhabitants, even to taking their daughters in marriage, whilst the Bujahs, on their side, began to adopt the religion of Isl\u0101m, in a form, it is true, which could meet with but little approval on the part of its orthodox teachers in Egypt. Their Isl\u0101m, it is said, was very \"weak.\"\n\nReturning, however, to Makrizi's anecdote, al-'Omari, he tells us, finding himself in want of supplies, wrote to the merchants of Assuan, one of whom responded by setting forth with no less than a thousand camels laden with provisions and stores. Sixty thousand camels, it is added, were (yearly) employed in carrying supplies from Assuan to the country of the Bujahs, irrespective of the merchants' caravans from Kulzum (Clysma) to 'Aydh\u0101b (on the Red Sea opposite Juddah).\u00b9\n\nOn the completion of the Arab conquest of Egypt throughout the Nile valley, as far as the first cataract, 'Amru ibn al-\u0100\u1e63, by command of the Khal\u012bfah 'Omar ibn al-Kha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101b, made war upon the Nubians, with no result that I find mentioned, excepting that his troops appear to have been grievously impressed by the skill of the Nubian archers. 'Abd Allah ibn Sa'd, after having been Am\u012br of Upper Egypt, succeeded 'Amru on the latter's recall. In A.D. 651\u20132 he renewed the war, and penetrated as far as Dongola, where the Nubian king, according to Arab authorities, was compelled to sue for peace, and it is stated, was put to an annual tribute. From other incidental statements in these narratives, as well as from the earlier historians, it may rather be gathered that what really occurred was an arrangement for the mutual exchange of\n\n\u00b9 See for Abu 'Abd ar-Rahman al-'Omari, Ibn al-Ath\u012br, vol. vii, pp. 181 and 182. But is it not through some error that the Bujahs are said to have been the enemies against whom al-'Omari entered into his campaign? It is stated that after defeating them, he invaded their country, looted it, captured many prisoners, and afterwards followed up his first successes with repeated raids. The story cannot be reconciled with what we know of the barren and desolate wastes inhabited by the Bujahs, and I find no account of al-'Omari's enterprise in Makrizi's Kh\u012blat, but he incidentally mentions al-'Omari's return to the mines after the conclusion of a war with the Nubians.\u2014Kh\u012blat, vol. i, pp. 196 and 199.\npresents\u2014slaves on the one part, corn and clothing on the other.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe relations thus established between the two nations remained in substance unchanged for several centuries, and throughout the period to which the Cufic gravestones of Assuan belong, with only casual interruptions, the result, according to Arab accounts, of aggressions on the parts of the Nubians, and on other occasions, of remissness in the payment of tribute. One dispute, it may be mentioned, of which particulars have been handed down to us, and which occurred in the early years of the third century of the Hijrah, concerning the possession by the Muslims of certain lands on the Nubian side of the border, was attended with some rather sharp practice on the part of the Arabs, but was peacefully settled in their favour.\n\nAfter the sixth century a decline in the prosperity of Assuan, which had already been in progress, became more and more marked. A great Arab family, the Banu'l-Kanz, obtained command over the border country. They were driven forth by the troops of Saladin, but regained their footing soon after A.H. 790, and entered into a series of struggles with the local rulers. Under the troubled reign of an-N\u0101\u1e63ir Farraj over Egypt (A.H. 801\u2013808), governors ceased to be appointed from Cairo, and the Banu'l Kanz became absolute masters of the country. But in A.H. 815 (A.D. 1412) they were attacked by the powerful tribe of Haww\u0101r\u0101h, who at that time held Upper Egypt at their mercy. They captured Assuan, plundered and ravaged the town, pulled down its walls, and massacred large numbers of its people. On their departure, carrying off the women and children into slavery, they left the place in ruins and utterly desolate.\\(^2\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See Tabari, ser. i, p. 2593, Ibn al-Ath\u012br, vol. ii, p. 443, and Makrizi, vol. i, p. 200.\n\n\\(^2\\) The author of the T\u0101j al-'Ar\u016bs gives a brief account of the tribe of Haww\u0101r\u0101h, drawn partly from a treatise composed by himself on the genealogy of the tribe, and partly from a small work by Makrizi, on the Arab tribes in Egypt, Al-Bay\u0101nu wa'l-I'r\u0101b 'emman fi Misr\u016b min \u1e32ad\u0101'il-a'I'r\u0101b, of which a copy, I believe, exists at Paris.\nThe British Museum possesses sixteen specimens of the Assuan tombstones, the inscriptions upon which have been published, with translations by the late Professor Wright, in the Proceedings of the Society for Biblical Archaeology for June, 1887. M. Henri Sauvaire has published several funerary inscriptions, including five from Assuan, deciphered from squeezes; and a letter, containing a brief account of the old cemetery, which I addressed at about the same time to the Institut Egyptien, and which was published in its Bulletin, may be mentioned for the purpose of stating that the earliest date I met with on the occasion referred to was A.H. 211.\n\nAs might be expected, strict accuracy in matters of grammar and orthography are not a characteristic of the Assuan tombstones. Thus we have \u062c\u0645\u0627\u062f\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0648\u0644 for \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0644\u0649; also \u0644\u0627\u0631\u0628\u0639 \u0639\u0634\u0631\u0629 \u062e\u0644\u062f\u062a for \u0644\u0627\u0631\u0628\u0639\u0629 \u0639\u0634\u0631\u0629 \u062e\u0644\u0648\u0646, and in like manner \u0644\u0627\u062d\u062f\u0649 for \u0644\u0627\u062d\u062f \u0639\u0634\u0631\u0629 \u062e\u0644\u0648\u0646 and \u062e\u0644\u062f\u062a. We find also \u0635\u0644\u064a (in the imperative) for \u0635\u0644, and on one of the stones the engraver has written \u0646\u0628\u0627, \u0646\u0628\u0627, and \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0639\u0644\u0627. It will be observed that \u0627\u0645\u0629, \u0627\u0628\u0646\u0629, and \u0631\u062d\u0645\u0629 are for the most part written with the open instead of with the closed ta.\n\nIn three of the proper names I have met with some difficulty. The name \u0627\u0645\u064a (No. 1) I have with some hesitation read \u0627\u0645\u064a, as if derived from \u0623\u0645 a mother, although like the name \u0627\u0645\u0629 it may possibly be connected with the verb \u0627\u0645\u0627. The feminine termination is absent, but the word resembles in that respect the name \u0645\u064a, which the lexicographers tell us stands for \u0645\u064a\u0629, and is allowable at least in poetry.\n\nThe name written \u062f\u0631\u0648 (No. 7) is likewise unknown to me,\n\n---\n\n1 I had not an opportunity of correcting the proof, but the only material error was the substitution in the date of a tombstone of A.H. 271 for 241.\nbut the Kam\u016bs and Taj al-\u2018Ar\u016bs have \u0643\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0631\u064f or \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064e\u0651\u0631\u0650\u0651 as a man's name. \u1e6cabari\u00b9 has \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064e\u0651\u0631\u0650\u0651, which, if an Arabic name, is perhaps related to the word \u062f\u064e\u0631\u0650\u0651 a pearl. In Maqrizi I have met with \u062f\u0631\u0649 (vol. ii, pp. 81, 82), the name of an Armenian Mamluk.\n\nA name closely resembling \u0645\u064f\u062e\u0652\u0634\u0649 occurs twice. In one case it might be read \u0645\u064f\u062d\u0652\u0633\u0650\u0644\u064d, but the letter which looks like a lam is possibly nothing more than an accidental defect on the surface of the stone. In No. 7 the word seems to be written \u0645\u064f\u0633\u0652\u062f\u0650\u064a, but it may be noted that in No. 1 the word dhi (dhi\u2018l-Ka\u2019dah) is written \u0637\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a.\n\nThe Assuan graveyard is a plain covered with a layer of sand, the depth of which seems to have undergone considerable increase since the time when, upwards of a thousand years ago, the spot was converted into a Muhammadan place of burial. The lower portions of the head-stones are buried in fine sand, almost as fluid as water, and it was practically impossible to scoop it away, so as to be able to read the concluding words of the inscriptions. These being, however, of a purely formal character, may, for the most part, be supplied without much difficulty. The inscription in No. 3 is complete, the stone having been removed from its original position and set into the wall of a tomb of recent date.\n\nThe graveyard of Assuan, I must finally add, presents a totally different aspect from that of a modern Arab cemetery. But for the sand and absence of verdure, it might, indeed, with more justice be likened to an old English churchyard. Neither cenotaphs nor their accompanying stelae are anywhere to be seen; nothing but the slabs, each standing erect at the end of the grave. They average for the most part, I should say, about twenty-four inches in height by about sixteen inches in\n\n\u00b9 de Goeje, ser. iii, pp. 1295\u20131300.\nwidth. There is nothing to show whether the dead were laid to rest in underground vaults of masonry, according to the orthodox practice of more modern times.\n\nI.

By Professor Legge, Oxford.\n\nIII. THE CHINESE TEXT AND TRANSLATION.\n\nI now conclude my Papers on the Li Sao.\n\nThe Chinese text is that approved by the famous Ch\u00fc Hsi in his \"Collection of Comments\" on all the portions of the Ch'\u00fc Te'se. I have taken it from the H\u00fb-pei edition of his Work in 1876. In studying the poem, I have made constant use of the Li Sao Ching, Chang Ch\u00fc by Wang Yi of our second century, and a minister of the later Han dynasty, as published in the Ch'ang-sha or H\u00fb-nan edition of 1882, with which is incorporated the \"Supplemental Commentary\" of Hung Hsing-ts\u00fb of our twelfth century. My earliest study of the poem, however, was from a reprint of the Wan He\u00fcan, or \"Selections of Literary Compositions,\" by Hsiao T'ung, with the posthumous title of Ch\u00e2o-ming, eldest son of the founder of the Liang dynasty (A.D. 502 to 556), containing also the commentary of Li Shan, a functionary of the T'ang dynasty.\n\nTwo versions of the poem have been frequently before me\u2014those of the late Marquis d'Hervey de Saint Denys, published at Paris in 1870, with \"Un Commentaire perp\u00e9tuel,\" and of the late Dr. August Pfizmaier, of the Imperial Academy of Sciences at Vienna. This was laid before a meeting of the department of the Academy so long ago as June, 1851, but does not appear to have been\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1895.\npublished separately till more recently. I have also consulted, and with advantage, a metrical translation by Mr. E. H. Parker, of Her Majesty's Consular Service in China, and the *Botanicon Sinicum* of Dr. Bretschneider.\n\nThe reader will find no notes accompanying my translation, but I beg to refer him to the second Paper, which was intended to give an account of the contents of the poem, and to supersede, for the present at least, longer notes and discussions.\n\u8ce6\u9a37\u96e2\u539f\u5c48\n\n\u6b32\u5fc3\u7336\u8c6b\u800c\u72d0\u7591\u516e\u6b32\u81ea\u9069\u800c\u4e0d\u53ef\u98a8\u7687\u65e2\u53d7\u8a52\u516e\u6050\u9ad8\u8f9b\u4e4b\u5148\u6211\u3002\nThe Li Sao Poem.\n\nTranslation.\n\nSection I. Stanzas 1 to 6.\n\n1. A descendant am I of the Ti Kao-yang.\n   My excellent deceased father was called Po-yung.\n   When Sheh-ti (=the planet Jupiter) culminated in the\n   first month of spring,\n   On kang-yin (=the 27th cycle-day) I was born.\n\n2. My father, in his first auspice at the inspection of me,\n   Commenced by giving me an auspicious name;\n   He named me \"Correct Pattern,\"\n   And afterwards styled me \"Efficient Adjuster.\"\n\n3. Largely gifted with those inward excellences,\n   I proceeded to add to them far-reaching ability.\n   I gathered and wore the angelicas of the streams, and\n   those of the hidden vales;\n   I strung together the autumn orchids to wear at my\n   girdle.\n\n4. I hurried myself as if I could not reach the goal;\n   I was afraid the years would not wait for me.\n   In the morning I plucked the magnolias of Pi;\n   In the evening I gathered the evergreen herbage of\n   the islands.\n\n5. The days and months passed hastily on without delaying;\n   Spring and autumn succeeded to each other.\n   Considering how the grass and trees withered and lost\n   their leaves,\n   I feared that the object of my admiration would be\n   late in arriving.\n6. He did not in his time of vigour put away his bad advisers.\n   Why did he not change his (erroneous) measures?\n   Why did he not yoke his grand steeds, and dash along,\n   And come to me to lead him in the way of the ancient (kings)?\n\nSection II. Stanzas 7 to 13.\n\n7. Anciently, the purity and agreement of the three Sovereigns\n   Was owing to their having all the perfumes around them.\n   They brought together the pepper-plant of Sh\u0103n, and\n   the finest cassia;\n   Their wreaths were not only of the h\u016di orchids, and\n   the ch\u2019ih.\n\n8. And the glorious greatness of Y\u0101o and Shun\n   Arose from their following the (right) way, and getting\n   the (right) path.\n   How did Chieh and Ch\u00e2u wear their clothes so ungirt?\n   Because, hurrying along their devious paths, their\n   steps were all-distressed.\n\n9. Those partizans, in their reckless pleasing of themselves,\n   Were leading on by darksome paths to a dangerous defile.\n   Did I dread the consequent suffering that would befall\n   myself?\n   I feared a fatal injury to the royal car and load.\n\n10. I hurried on, now before and now behind,\n    That the ruler might be kept in the footprints of the\n    former kings.\n    His Majesty would not consider the loyal feelings of\n    my heart;\n    He believed the slanderers, and burned with anger\n    (against me).\n11. I well knew that straight-forward words would bring calamity,\nBut I could not repress myself, and forbear them.\nI pointed to the nine heavens in confirmation of my truth;\u2014\nAll for the sake of His Majesty's intelligence.\n\n12. He had appointed the time of dusk for our meeting,\nBut in the middle of the way (to me) he altered his path.\n\n13. At first he had given me this promise,\nBut afterwards he repented, avoided me, and took other counsellors.\nI do not think it hard to be separated from him;\nI am grieved that, intelligent as he is, he should be subject to so many changes.\n\nSection III. Stanzas 14, 15.\n\n14. I had planted nine large fields of orchids;\nI had sown a hundred acres of the hui orchid.\nThe dykes of my fields showed the liu-t and chieh-ch'\u00ea,\nMixed with asarums and fragrant angelicas.\n\n15. I hoped that their branches and leaves would be long and luxuriant!\nAnd wished to wait for the time when I should cut them down.\nThough they wither and pass away, why should that grieve me?\nI lament that, with all their perfume, they were regarded as useless weeds.\n\nSection IV. Stanzas 16 to 22.\n\n16. They all emulously strove for advancement through their greed of money and their gluttony;\nThough full, they never wearied of seeking for more.\nAh! they took the measure of others from themselves;\nEach one excited himself to hatred and jealousy.\n17. Recklessly they drove along in pursuit (of their objects),\nWhich were quite unimportant to me.\nOld age will gradually come on me,\nAnd I fear that the cultivation of my name will not have been accomplished.\n\n18. In the morning I drank the dew that had fallen from the magnolia trees;\nIn the evening I ate the flowers that had fallen from the autumn asters.\nThus sincerely devoted to, and believing in, what is good, and practising what is most important,\nWhat did I care for the meagre and emaciated visage?\n\n19. I grasped the roots of trees to bind with them the ch\u2019ih;\nI strung together the flowers dropt from the fig trees;\nI straightened (the branches of) the finest cassia to thread the orchids on them;\nI bound with the h\u00fa-sh\u0103ng beautiful bouquets.\n\n20. It is hard, but I strive to imitate the culture of the former time,\nThough it is not what the manners of this age approve.\nThough it is not conformed to the (views of the) men of to-day,\nI wish to imitate the pattern handed down by P\u2019ang Hsien.\n\n21. I heave deep sighs, whilst I endeavour to hide my tears;\nLamenting the many afflictions to which men are born.\nThough I love to cultivate what is good and pure, it serves to me as a bit and bridle.\nFaithfully in the morning I remonstrated, and in the evening I was dismissed.\n\n22. Though dismissed, I still wore the cincture of h\u00fai orchids;\nAnd added to it a garland which I made of angelicas.\nThe character so emblemed was what my heart approved.\nEven nine deaths would not make me regret my course.\nSection V. Stanzas 23 to 25.\n\n23. I was indignant that our Intelligent Ruler should be so greatly indifferent,\nAnd never examine the minds of the people.\n(The courtiers, like) the ladies (of a harem), all hated my silk-worm eyebrows,\nAnd vilified me, saying I was given to licentiousness.\n\n24. Yes, stupid are the skilful builders of to-day!\nThey turn the back on the compass and square; they lay them aside for other measures;\nThey reject the line marked by the plummet, and try a crooked one instead;\nThey strive to get themselves borne with: this is their constant rule.\n\n25. Sad and disappointed, I am irresolute;\nI am now solitary, and reduced to the greatest straits.\nBut sudden death and banishment would be more welcome to me\nThan to act in such a way as they do.\n\nSection VI. Stanzas 26 to 33.\n\n26. The birds of prey do not collect in flocks;\nSo it has been in all generations.\nHow can the square and the round fit in together?\nHow can those who pursue different ways agree together?\n\n27. I bent my mind and controlled my will,\nTo bear the charges against me, and cast from me the shame of them.\nI would keep pure and unstained, and even die in maintenance of the right;\nPursuing the course which the earlier sages approved.\n28. I regretted that I had not examined more my course,\nAnd long stood considering whether I should go back;\nTurning my carriage round, and retracing my way,\nWhile yet I had not gone far astray.\n\n29. I walked my horses through the orchid fields along\nthe lake;\nThen I galloped them to the mound of pepper trees,\nand there stopt.\nMy advance was ineffectual to lead (the king) from\nhis errors,\nAnd I retired to cultivate again my former habits.\n\n30. I fashioned the (flowers of the) water-caltrops and lotus\nto (adorn) my upper garment;\nI collected those of the hibiscus for my lower one.\nIf he acknowledged me not, I would give up my efforts;\nMy own wishes were to realize a similar fragrancy.\n\n31. How loftily rose the top of my cap!\nHow many and various were the ornaments of my\ngirdle!\nHow did their fragrance and soft beauty blend together,\nShowing that my brightness and ability had not failed!\n\n32. Suddenly I turned round, to let my eyes look all about;\nI would go and see the most distant regions of the four\nquarters.\nThe rich appurtenances of my girdle and its many\nornaments (would be seen),\nTheir exuberant fragrance would be more displayed!\n\n33. Every man born has that in which he delights,\nBut I alone wish to cultivate what is good as my\nconstant work;\nThough my body were torn in pieces, I would not\nchange.\nIs there anything in my mind to reprove?\nSection VII. Stanzas 34 to 36.\n\n34. (My sister,) N\u00fc-hs\u00fc, drawn by her affection,\nWould gently say to me, while blaming me,\n\"Kw\u00e4n, obstinate and unbending, brought upon him\nhis death,\nComing at last to a premature end in the wild of Y\u00fc.\n\n35. \"Why do you so fully speak out your mind, and\nindulge your love of culture,\nStanding out alone in the possession of your admirable\nqualities?\nLike the tribulus, the king-grass, and the burr-weed,\nyour enemies fill the court,\nWhile you stand separate with quite another mind.\"\n\n36. (I replied,) \"How can all men be talked with from\nhouse to house?\nWho would examine the real facts of my case?\nIn the world they all put one another forward, and love\npartizanship;\nHow should they regard a poor solitary like me, and\nlisten to me?\"\n\nSection VIII. Stanzas 37 to 46.\n\n37. I would test the correctness of my views by those\nof the former sages,\nAnd mournfully in my excitement unfold all my\nmind.\nI crossed the Y\u00fcan and the Hsiang on my way to the\nsouth,\nAnd by the grave of Ch'ung-hwa set forth my plaint.\n\n38. Ch'i (received) the Nine Accounts (of the provinces of\nthe kingdom) and the Nine Songs about them.\n(His son), K'ang of Hsi\u00e2, found his pleasure in self-\nindulgence,\nWithout thinking of the troubles (arising from it), or any consideration of the future;\nAnd (his brothers), \"the Five Sons,\" thereby lost their possessions.\n\n39. \u00ce, given to vicious indulgence, found his pleasure in hunting,\nAnd was fond of shooting the great foxes,\nBut seldom is it that one abandoned to disorder and idleness comes to a (good) end;\nAnd Cho, (\u00ce's minister), was coveting his wife.\n\n40. (Cho's son) \u00c2o was possessed of immense strength.\nAbandoned to his lusts, he put no restraint on himself;\nDaily devoted to pleasure, he forgot all restraints,\nTill his head in consequence fell from his body.\n\n41. Chieh of Hsi\u00e2 was a constant rebel (against right),\nTaking his own way, and meeting with calamity.\nKing Hsin cut up and pickled (the flesh of the Earl of Mei),\nAnd in consequence the temple of (the kings of) Yin did not last long.\n\n42. T'ang and Y\u00fc, in their dignified awe, were reverent and respectful;\n(The founders of) Ch\u00e2u weighed well the Path, and erred not in regard to it.\nThey employed the wise and talented, and gave power to the able;\nThey kept to the straight line, without deviation from it.\n\n43. August Heaven has no private partialities;\nIt observes the qualities of men, and disowns or helps accordingly.\nIt is only the conduct fully ordered by sage wisdom\nThat can obtain rule on this earth below.\n44. Looking back to the earlier and round on the later times,\nWe obtain a complete view of (Heaven's) dealings with men.\nWho without righteousness was ever fit to be employed?\nWho without goodness was ever fit to direct affairs?\n\n45. As on a precipice I exposed my person to danger, and nearly met with death;\nBut looking on my course from the first, I still feel no regret.\nIt was by not measuring their chisel, and fashioning the handle for it,\nThat former worthies caused themselves to be killed and kept in pickle.\n\n46. Sighing and sobbing because of my distressful sorrow,\nI bewailed that the time is so unsuitable for me.\nI took the soft hui orchids to wipe the tears,\nThe torrents of which wet the lapel of my gown.\n\nSection IX. Stanzas 47 to 65.\n\n47. Kneeling on my outspread skirt, I set forth my complaint;\nAnd had a clear conviction that my views were true and correct.\nIn car drawn by four unhorned dragons, smooth as jade, and mounted on a phoenix,\nIt was for me at once, through dust and wind, to travel on high.\n\n48. In the morning I started from Ts'ang-wu,\nAnd in the evening I came to Hs\u00fcan-pu.\nI wished to delay a little at the sculptured gate (of this abode) of the Immortals,\nBut the day seemed hastening to the evening.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1895.\n49. I commanded Hsi and Ho to delay the stages of their course,\nAnd not to hurry on as they made for Yen-tsze.\nThe way was long, and distant far was my goal:\nI would ascend and descend, pursuing my search.\n\n50. I watered my horses at the pool of Hsien;\nI gathered up and tied my reins to a Fu-sang (tree);\nI broke off a branch from a Zo tree to defend myself from the sun:\nThus did I enjoy myself, aimlessly wandering.\n\n51. Before me I sent Wang-shu, (the Charioteer of the Moon), as my precursor,\nAnd behind me Fei-lien, (the Baron of the Wind),\nhurried on in attendance;\nA hcan and a phoenix went before with guardian care;\nThe Master of Thunder told of anything that had not been prepared.\n\n52. I ordered the phoenix to fly aloft,\nAnd continue its flight day and night.\nBut a whirlwind brought together my opponents;\u2014\nClouds and rainbows were led to meet and oppose me.\n\n53. In multitudes they came together, now dividing, now collecting.\nIn confusion they separated, some going above, and others beneath.\nI ordered the porter of God to open the gate,\nBut, leaning against it, he only stared at me.\n\n54. The time was dark and obscure, and I was nearly wearied out;\nI tied (to my girdle) the secluded orchids, and remained long as if not heeding anything.\nThe age was one of confusion and greed, where no notice was taken of the different characters of men;\nThe good were kept in obscurity, and viewed with hatred and jealousy.\n55. On the morrow, being about to cross the White-water,\nI ascended to the top of Lang-fang, and there haltered\nmy horses.\nSuddenly I looked back and shed tears,\nLamenting that on the lofty height there was no lady\n(for me).\n\n56. Forthwith I rambled to this palace of the Spring\nAnd broke off a branch of the ch'\u00fcng tree to add to\nmy girdle.\nBefore the glorious flower (of my years) had fallen,\nI would see the attendant of the lady to transmit an\noffering (for me).\n\n57. I ordered F\u00e4ng-lung (=the Master of Thunder) to\nmount on a cloud,\nAnd search for the place where the lady F\u00fb was.\nI unloosed the string of my girdle to serve as the gage\nof my truth,\nAnd ordered Ch'ien-hsi\u00fb to transact the affair for me.\n\n58. In multitudes (he and others) came together, now\ndividing, now collecting.\nSuddenly misunderstandings arose, difficult to change.\nIn the evening I returned and halted at Ch'\u00fcng-shih;\nIn the morning I washed my hair in the water of\nW\u00eai-p'an.\n\n59. She guarded her beauty with a haughty arrogance;\nShe daily sought her pleasure in licentious abandonment,\nTruly beautiful she was, but had no regard to propriety;\nTherefore I abandoned her, and sought elsewhere.\n\n60. In my inspection I surveyed (the earth) to its four\nextreme points;\nI travelled all over the sky, and then descended (to\nthe earth).\n(There,) looking to the lofty height of the Y\u00e2o-built\ntower,\nI saw the beautiful daughter of the prince of Sung.\n61. I ordered Ch\u0103n to make proposals of a union with her for me,\nBut he told me that she was not good.\n(Then) there passed by a jackdaw screaming;\nBut I still hated the lightness and craft of them both.\n\n62. My mind full of doubt, and, mistrusting as a fox,\nI wished to go myself, but it was not proper for me to do so.\nThe ph\u0153nix, (moreover,) had been employed by K\u00e2o-hsin\nto negotiate a marriage with her,\nAnd I feared that (that sovereign) had anticipated me.\n\n63. I wished to settle far off, but there was no place where\nI could rest;\nPerhaps I might wander aimlessly about and enjoy myself.\n(Ah!) while Sh\u00e2o-k'ang was yet unmarried,\nThere would have been left for me the two Y\u00e2os of the state of Y\u00fc!\n\n64. My grounds of application were weak, and my go-between was stupid;\nI was afraid that the communication of my views would not be (sufficiently) firm.\nThe age is one of confusion and greed, and of hatred of the wise and good;\nAll love to keep the excellent in obscurity, and to celebrate the praises of the bad.\n\n65. (Since) the female apartments inside are so deep and distant,\nAnd the wise king moreover does not awake,\nI will keep my feelings in my breast, and not express them.\nHow can I bear to abide with such people so long as the ages of the past?\nSection X. Stanzas 66 to 70.\n\n66. I searched for the *hibiscus* and the grass-ropes, to divine\nwith the splinters of bamboo,\nAnd commanded Ling-fan to explain their indications\nfor me.\nHe said, \"(It is,) The two Beauties are sure to act\nin union;\nBut who (here) will believe in your culture, and desire it?\n\n67. \"Consider the vast extent of the nine regions:\nIs it only here that the lady (whom you seek) is to\nbe found?\nI tell you, Strive to go away far, and allow no doubts\nto arise:\nWho will be seeking an admirable (partner), and\nneglect you?\n\n68. \"What place is there in which alone there are no\nfragrant plants?\nWhy do you keep on thinking of your past abode?\"\n(But I rejoined,) \"The age is dark, and dazzled by\nwhat is bright.\nWho will examine whether I am good or bad?\n\n69. \"People differ in their likings and dislikings;\nBut those partizans (in Ch'\u00fc) are peculiar, and differ\nfrom all others.\nIn every house they carry at their waists bags full\nof moxa,\nAnd say that the secluded orchids are not fit for their\ngirdles.\n\n70. \"However they look at and examine plants and trees,\nthey still cannot distinguish one from another;\nHow much less can they estimate the value of the\nbrilliant ch'dng jade!\nThey collect muck and earth to fill their perfume bags;\nAnd say that the pepper plant of Sh\u00e4n has no\nfragrance.\"\nSection XI. Stanzas 71 to 79.\n\n71.

XXVII.\u2014Counter-marks on early Persian and Indian Coins. By E. J. Rapson, M.A., Late Fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge.\n\nThe addition of a counter-mark to a coin already current has usually served one or other of two distinct purposes. It has occasionally merely denoted the ratification or re-sanction of a currency already legal; it has more frequently been used to show some change in the conditions of a currency\u2014as, for instance, a change in its value as legal tender, or its circulation in a different country or under a different government. The true interpretation of many ancient counter-marks would no doubt add considerably to our knowledge of the world's history. Unfortunately their evidence is generally of that kind which suggests a great deal more than it can prove; and it must be confessed that their contribution to knowledge has been disappointingly small.\u00b9\n\nThe silver coins, or sigloi, struck by the princes of the Ach\u00e6menid dynasty of Persia from the reign of Darius (B.C. 521\u2013485) to the end of the dynasty in B.C. 331, afford one of the best known examples of the practice of counter-marking in antiquity. In this instance, the practice is strictly confined to the silver coinage. No example of a counter-struck gold Persian coin\u2014daric or double-daric\u2014is known. Of the numerous marks found on the silver coins, numismatists have been inclined to regard some as letters and the others as symbols distinctive of the various provinces of the great Persian empire in which the imperial coinage was current. The latest authority, M. Ernest Babelon, in plate xxxix of his great work, \"Les Perse Ach\u00e9m\u00e9nides,\"\n\n\u00b9 For the literature of ancient counter-marks see Engel, Revue Numismatique, 1887, p. 382.\nhas published a collection of these marks, and on p. xi of his preface he gives reasons for attributing several of them to certain countries\u2014viz. Lycia, Pamphylia, Cilicia, and Cyprus\u2014in which the custom of counter-marking is known to have obtained. That M. Babelon's attributions are extremely probable, if indeed they are not absolutely certain, is shown by the occurrence of precisely the same marks, formed in precisely the same manner, on certain coins of the countries mentioned. The only doubt which can be entertained is whether the Persian imperial coins and the coins of these countries may not equally have obtained their counter-marks from some common and as yet undetermined source.\n\nMy object, in the present paper, will be to show that there was one province of the Persian empire\u2014the province of India, that is to say, territory on both sides of the Indus, including much of what is now known as the Panj\u0101b and Sind\u2014in which counter-marked weights of metal constituted the recognized form of coinage, and that to this province some of the counter-marks in question, whether interpreted as letters or as symbols, may very plausibly be referred.\n\nThe Persian occupation of North-western India lasted for about a century and three-quarters. It began during the reign of Darius, probably c. 500 B.C., and lasted till 331 B.C., when, after the battle of Arbela, the whole empire of the Ach\u00e6menids acknowledged the sovereignty of Alexander the Great. Evidences of extensive intercourse during this period between the centre of the Persian empire and its Indian satrapy are abundant on all hands; and it must not be forgotten in this connection that the fact of a regular commerce, also during this period, between India and the West\u2014Greece, Ph\u0153nicia, and various cities of Asia Minor\u2014is well established. It is, therefore, quite possible that the influence of India may be traced not only on the coins of Persia, but also on the coins of other Western states\u2014for instance, the very states mentioned by M. Babelon. But, in the present paper, we must confine our attention to Persia and India. Of the intimate relation of these two during the Ach\u00e6menid period, there can be\nno doubt. Not only have we the evidence of writers like Hecataeus and Herodotus, but we have the more tangible evidence of architectural remains in Northern India, which show the predominating influence of Persian art. From the fifth century B.C. onwards the wealth of India becomes proverbial in all literature. The stories in Xenophon's Cyrop\u00e6dia, for example\u2014worthless as that production is as a history of the times of Cyrus, it may still be quoted as evidence for the ideas of Xenophon's time\u2014show that the Persian king regarded India as an unfailing source of riches. This wealth, as Herodotus has shown, consisted in gold dust; and in exchange for this, the commodities of the West, and silver among them, came in great quantities to India. General Sir A. Cunningham (\"Coins of Ancient India,\" p. 5) has shown by quotations from the Periplus maris Erythraei that \"the merchants made a profit by exchanging their own money for Indian gold. Gold was cheap in India, being as 1 to 8 rates of silver, whereas in Persia the rate was 13 of silver.\" And what was true at the date of the Periplus (probably the latter part of the first century A.D.), was undoubtedly true at an earlier period. This fact of the attraction of silver to India accounts for the large number of ancient silver coins still found there. These coins are of various kinds, the two most noteworthy varieties being Athenian and Persian; but undoubtedly the Persian coins vastly outnumber all the others. Probably no great collection made in the Panj\u00e1b has not included several specimens, and dealers in the Panj\u00e1b have repeatedly submitted them to the British Museum for purchase. Several specimens in the collection of the British Museum were transferred from the India Office collection, and therefore presumably came from India, while the Indian origin of others is extremely probable, though, unfortunately, only the name of the collection to which the coins belonged, and no note of their actual provenance, has been preserved.\n\nThe most striking confirmation of the fact that Persian sigloi circulated freely in the Indian satrapy would\u2014if its\norigin were undisputed\u2014be derived from the weight-standard adopted for the silver coinage of all the Greek princes of Northern India. After the transference of the Greek power from Bactria to the Kabul valley and the Panj\u0101b\u2014a transference which began about 200 B.C. and was completed probably before 120 B.C.\u2014the Attic standard is abandoned for another, which has been identified with the Persian.\\(^1\\) The change is gradual. The purely Bactrian princes use only the Attic standard; those princes who ruled both in Bactria and India strike coins of both standards; their successors, who ruled only in India, adopt the so-called Persian standard only.\n\nNow, according to the view commonly accepted, this change was adopted with the object of bringing the Gr\u00e6co-Indian silver coinage into relation with the Persian coinage, in such a way that two Greek hemidrachms of about 40 grains (2\u00b759 grammes) might be the exact equivalent of a Persian siglos of 80 grains (5\u00b718 grammes). This would seem to be the most natural way of explaining this change of weight-standard\u2014it was necessitated by change of locality, and was in accordance with the recognized standards of this locality. If this view be correct, we have here the most conclusive evidence of the predominance of Persian power, and of the circulation of Persian silver coins, in North-western India.\n\nThis explanation has, however, been disputed by the greatest of Indian numismatists, General Sir A. Cunningham, who explains (*Num. Chron.*, 1888, p. 216) the change of standard by purely economic considerations as due to a real change in the relative values of gold and silver. Every argument of so great an authority is entitled to serious consideration; and if the fact, or the probability, of such an alteration in the relative values of gold and silver could be proved for India at this period, this particular argument would be irresistible. But it does not appear\n\n\\(^1\\) Gardner, \"Brit. Mus. Cat. of Indian Coins: 'Greek and Scythic Kings,'\" p. lxviii.\nthat any such change can be proved or was probable. In fact, General Cunningham's own quotations from the Periplus above cited are against this supposition; and, on the other hand, the Persian influence in North-west India during the Achaemenid period is known to have been so strong, that we have little cause for surprise if we find a further trace of this influence in so important a subject as the monetary standard.\n\nIn suggesting an Indian origin for some, at least, of the counter-marks borne by these Persian sigloi, I shall try to show first that the practice of counter-marking the native coinage was universal in India at this period, and that it is extremely probable that any foreign coins taken into circulation would receive the same treatment. Unfortunately, in the imperfect state of our present knowledge of the numismatics of ancient India, very little can yet be regarded as proved beyond dispute. The very fact of the existence of an independent native Indian coinage at this period\u2014fifth and fourth centuries B.C.\u2014has as yet not been universally recognized. It is even now not rare to find the Western origin of the Indian coinage taken for granted, and further used as an argument in support of other supposed borrowings from the West.\u00b9 In fact, the arguments on the other side have hitherto not received the attention which they deserve, and I may, therefore, perhaps be excused if I state these arguments here as briefly and cogently as I can.\n\n(1) It seems only possible to explain the square Indian form as the result of an independent development of the art of coin-making. The ancient Indian coin is little more than an approximately square or oblong weight, sometimes a piece cut from a sheet of metal, sometimes merely a length of metal cut from a bar. The origin of all the Western coinages, on the other hand, is to be traced to\n\n\u00b9 For instance, by the late Prof. J. Darmesteter, in the Journal Asiatique for 1892, p. 62, the last but one in that brilliant series of rapports annuels in which this truly great scholar was wont to summarize the whole progress of Oriental research.\nthe bullet-shaped weight, which, when struck by the die, tended, because of the expansion of the metal on all sides, to assume an approximately round shape. It is surely not to be imagined that one of these systems could have been derived from the other.\n\n(2) A coinage of square form was so firmly established in India at the date of the Greek invasion from Bactria, which began c. 200 B.C., that it was imitated by the earliest Greek settlers\u2014Demetrius, Pantaleon, and Agathocles. The whole story of the introduction of a Greek coinage first into Bactria and then into India is full of interest from a morphological point of view. The Greek coinage in Bactria remained purely Greek in type and execution, because there was no previously existing Bactrian coinage to influence it in any way. This Greek coinage, immediately on its transference to India, begins to be modified in every particular\u2014type, execution, shape, and weight\u2014because it was found necessary to adjust it to some extent to the native coinage.\n\n(3) These square coins are actually represented in sculptures from the Mah\u0101bodhi temple at Buddha-Gaya, and from the great st\u016bpa at Bharhut. Both of these monuments probably date from the middle of the third century B.C.\n\n(4) Certain copper coins of square form, bearing the inscription \u0391\u039b\u0395\u039e\u0391\u039d\u0394\u03a1\u039f\u03a5, have with great probability been regarded as an Indian issue of Alexander the Great. If this attribution be correct, it would follow that a native coinage of the square form must have been firmly established before 326 B.C.\n\n(5) The evidence derived from literary sources, which has been most carefully examined and weighed by such authorities as Burnouf, Thomas, Cunningham, and Rhys Davids, while not proving any positive date for the beginning of a coinage in India, allows of the existence of a coinage for some considerable period before the beginning of the fourth century B.C.\n\nIn face of these arguments it is difficult to doubt that the square Indian coins\u2014the so-called punch-marked coins\n\u2014which are found in considerable numbers in nearly every part of India, were actually in circulation in the Indian satrapy during the Ach\u00e6menian period, and in company with Ach\u00e6menian coins. If the following view as to the nature of the punch-marks found on the Indian coins be correct, the occurrence of similar punch-marks, or counter-marks, on the contemporary Persian sigloi would be explained.\n\nThe conservatism of the Indian mind is proverbial; and in studying the ancient institutions of the country more help is usually to be obtained from a consideration of the state of things still existing than is afforded by any analogies derived from our knowledge of other ancient civilizations. Perhaps the most distinctive and the most persistent feature in the social history of India is the organization of the village community. \"These village communities are little republics, having nearly everything that they want within themselves, and almost independent of any foreign relations. Dynasty after dynasty tumbles down; revolution succeeds to revolution; Hindoo, Patan, Mogul, Mahratta, Seik, English, are all masters in turn, but the village communities remain the same.\"\u00b9 This organization was in ancient times, if not universal, certainly more widely prevalent throughout India than it remains at the present day; and it seems probable that such matters as the issue of coinage were regulated by local authorities\u2014money-changers or merchants\u2014and not by the imperial authority. The very great variety of early Indian coins would thus be naturally explained, and such inscriptions as are found on them have been interpreted by Dr. B\u00fchler in a sense which entirely supports this view. In referring to specimens represented in plate iii of Cunningham's \"Coins of Ancient India,\" figures 8, 9, 10, 11, all of which bear the word negam\u0101 on the reverse, together with other words on the obverse, he says, \"The word negam\u0101 is common enough in Pali and\n\n\u00b9 Montgomery Martin, \"History of the British Colonies\" (1836), vol. i, p. 340.\nin the epigraphic Prakrits, and means always 'the traders.' It shows here that the coins are mercantile money-tokens, issued by traders, and the names on the obverse may be either names of towns or of guilds. The latter explanation is perhaps the more probable one.\"\u00b9 When Dr. B\u00fchler communicated this discovery to me, I at once saw in it a striking confirmation of a theory already suggested by Sir A. Cunningham to account for some of the punch-marks found on the uninscribed specimens. He says (\"Coins of Ancient India,\" p. 58): \"Another explanation of some of these symbols has struck me as possible, or perhaps even probable. I have a suspicion that several of the symbols may have been the private marks of ancient money-changers. At the present day these men are still in the habit of placing their own particular stamps on the rupees that pass through their hands, so that when any of the coins come back to them again, they know their value without making a second testing.\"\n\nThis attribution, already sufficiently probable in itself, is thus supported by a reference to the practice of the shroffs of modern times, whose methods no doubt differ little from those of their ancestors more than two thousand years ago, except in so far as the greater exactness of weight and the security against fraud afforded by the imperial coinage and the best of native coinages have rendered the use of the money-changer's private stamp less and less necessary. If, then, in ancient times the issue and regulation of the coinage was mainly or exclusively in the hands of the local authorities, the use of these distinguishing marks must have been universal and generally recognized, and they would, as a matter of course, be applied to all silver coins in circulation, whether native, as the \"punch-marked\" coins, or foreign, as the Persian sigloi.\n\nWhile dealing with the subject of the earliest Indian coins, we may perhaps venture to carry our investigations one step farther. It has long been recognized that these\n\n\u00b9 Indian Studies, No. iii: \"On the Origin of the Indian Br\u0101hma Alphabet,\" p. 47.\npunch-marks are not used without some discrimination.\\(^1\\) The typical specimen has one of its sides, usually called the obverse, more or less completely covered with a number of different punch-marks, evidently applied at different times, and often in such a manner that the later stamps have been partly superimposed on the earlier. The other side, the reverse, has, in a great number of instances, only one mark in the centre. Even when the reverse bears two or more stamps, they are usually different in character from those found on the obverse. They are smaller, and they show less variety. There occur cases in which, from want of space, obverse marks have been imprinted on the reverse; but it is doubtful if the converse statement is ever true. The reverse marks seem not to be found on the obverse.\n\nAnother observation of General Cunningham's suggests an explanation of this distinction. \"I have often thought,\" he says, \"that where only one stamp is found on the reverse it might possibly be the peculiar symbol of the place of issue. I found, for instance, that about one-third of the silver punch coins discovered at Taxila bore the same stamp placed alone on the reverse, and as this particular stamp is found as the full reverse of the small gold coins of Taxila, I think my conjecture may be correct. . . . A second symbol I have noted as being often placed alone on the punch-marked coins from Benares and the surrounding districts.\"\\(^2\\) Coupling this observation with the injunction of Manu, viii, 403, \"All weights and measures must be duly marked, and once in six months let him (i.e. \\(nrpa\\), the prince) re-examine them,\"\\(^3\\) we may perhaps still more\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Thomas, \"Ancient Indian Weights,\" p. 57.\n\\(^2\\) \"Coins of Ancient India,\" p. 56.\n\\(^3\\) Dr. B\u00fchler's translation in \"Sacred Books of the East,\" p. 324.

In Manu coins are well known, but they are still regarded as weights, and consequently they are, no doubt, included in the injunction just quoted. The \"prince\" is the governor of the district\u2014perhaps, if the period referred to is anterior to the rise of the great kingdoms, an independent ruler, or perhaps already dependent on some over-lord; in any case, he is the official whose duty it was to take personal cognizance of the minutest affairs of the people under his care, to settle the prices of their commodities, to act as their judge, and in fact to fulfil numberless functions which could never have been discharged by the monarch of a great kingdom. The fact, then, that the coins issued for circulation had first to receive the stamp of his approval, by no means invalidates our contention that, in ancient India, the right of coinage was in no sense an imperial prerogative.\\(^1\\) The merchants or money-changers, to whom we have attributed the obverse punch-marks, had simply to submit their coins to the chief authority in the district, who rejected such as were deficient in weight or quality of metal, and sanctioned such as were approved by marking them with his official stamp, which may perhaps be identified with the solitary punch-mark so often found in the centre of the reverse. The occasional occurrence of more than one of these reverse punch-marks on a coin is naturally explained by supposing the coin to have passed current in more than one district, and consequently to have been officially tested more than once.\n\nIn the following detailed list of those counter-marks found on the Persian sigloi, whose origin may most probably be traced to India, it should be remembered that only the Persian collection in the British Museum has been examined. When other collections also have been examined from this\n\n\\(^1\\) Thomas, \"Ancient Indian Weights,\" p. 57 note, shows that in the fourteenth century in Southern India \"goldsmiths and dealers in bullion were authorized, by prescriptive right, to fabricate money at will on their own account\"; and he further quotes from Malcolm (\"Central India,\" 1832) to show that in the present century any banker or merchant was permitted to coin money at the mints of Central India.\nspecial point of view, we may expect further evidence tending either to confirm or to disprove the theory here propounded.\n\nBr\u0101hma Characters.\n\nJ = yo, Plate, Fig. 1.\n\nI = va, Figs. 2\u20135.\n\nJ = kha. This letter or symbol is of common occurrence, though, by an unfortunate omission, no example has been given in the plate. If regarded as a letter, its form would well agree with Dr. B\u00fchler's description of the oldest form of kha, \"a circle with a super-imposed vertical line ending in a curve\" (Indian Studies, iii: \"On the Origin of the Indian Br\u0101hma Alphabet,\" p. 66), and with the representation given in his plate (id., col. v, 1). Numismatists have, however, usually supposed it to be the symbol, occurring on Lycian coins, to which Mr. Hill has given the name monosceles, as contrasted with the commoner trisceles symbol (Num. Chron., 1895, p. 11).\n\nL = pa, Fig. 6.\n\nE = ja, Figs. 15 and 16. This identification is doubtful. The letter ja only assumed this form in late times, though Dr. B\u00fchler has pointed out that an approximation to this form E occurs even in the A\u015boka edicts (op. cit., p. 39).\n\nY = go, Fig. 17.

After having examined and discussed the systems which have hitherto been used, and taken note of the various improvements which have been suggested by members of the Congress and other savants, the Committee submit for the approval of the Congress, and with a view to general adoption by Orientalists, the systems shown in the two tabular forms annexed to this report.\n\nThey have taken as a basis for their work the report presented by a special committee appointed by the Royal Asiatic Society of London, and the systems of transliteration usually adopted in France, in Germany, and by the Bengal Asiatic Society. They do not pretend to have discovered a perfectly scientific system; it was necessary to give weight to established usages, and also to take into consideration the varying pronunciations which the letters of the Arabic alphabet have received in different Muhammadan countries. This is one reason for the alternative modes of transliteration proposed for certain letters, but the number\nfor which these alternative methods are suggested has been kept as small as possible, and it is hoped that the Orientalists of every country will endeavour to still further reduce this number by conforming as much as possible to the system recommended by the Committee.\n\nAs regards the transliteration of Sanskrit, the differences of opinion have been much less, and only in the case of a very small number of letters has any difficulty arisen. In these instances the Committee have chosen from among the various equivalents proposed those which on the whole seem best suited for practical use.\n\nTo obtain uniformity each country and each society must make some concessions, and the Committee hope that the systems now proposed will be unanimously adopted and brought into general use.\n\nBarbier de Meynard,\nG.

Their aim has been more modest; taking into consideration the systems of transliteration which have, it may be said, passed a \"first reading,\" on the one hand that of the Royal Asiatic Society and on the other that of the Deutsche Morgenl\u00e4ndische Gesellschaft, but allowing modifications as to details, it was necessary to come to a decision, and by a certain amount of give-and-take to harmonize these two. We have neither the right nor the power to establish a general uniformity, which must, however, be our principal aim: for instance, I made no proposal on behalf of the French; nevertheless, the transliterations adopted in different countries have shown such a general tendency towards unification that we may now, without presumption, look for a unanimous agreement in the near future. It was desirable, therefore, to adopt such proposals\nas by their simplicity seemed likely to bring about a general agreement.\n\nWe must not lose sight of the essentially practical character of our task; it is therefore incumbent on us to pay especial attention to the sentiments expressed in India, where the adoption of a uniform system of transliteration for proper names and for every-day use is particularly urgent.\n\nUnder these conditions the Sub-Committee were naturally ready to welcome suggestions made from any quarter, and consequently they have come to a unanimous decision, except on one single point. The two proposed systems agree in transcribing by \\( r \\) and \\( l \\) (dot below) the vowels \\( r \\) and \\( l \\).\n\nM. de Saussure, so well qualified to speak as a linguist, has not seen his way to accept this; he would like his objections recorded in writing as follows:\n\n\"It is desirable in the interests of Indo-European linguistic studies, and apart from all personal predilection, to adopt \\( r \\), \\( l \\) instead of \\( r \\), \\( l \\), because in the analysis of every Indo-European language, including Sanskrit, the vowels \\( m \\), \\( n \\) hold a place corresponding in every way to that of the vowels \\( r \\), \\( l \\); therefore, if one adopts \\( r \\), \\( l \\) one forces linguists to write \\( m \\), \\( n \\), and consequently a confusion arises\u2014for \\( m \\) with certain notations of the anusv\u0101ra, for \\( n \\) with the cerebral consonant \\( n \\).\"\n\nThe Sub-Committee cannot ignore the force of this reasoning; they are the less doubtful on this point inasmuch as, according to MM. B\u00fchler and Windisch, the German Oriental Society had at first spontaneously inserted on their programme the transliteration \\( r \\) and \\( l \\) (with the circle). If, in spite of all, the Sub-Committee have not thought it right to propose the adoption of this amendment, it is for purely practical reasons.\n\nThe German Committee only arrived at the transliteration \\( r \\), \\( l \\) (with the dot) after discussion and a direct vote. Would it be prudent to re-open the debate on a detail concerning which the German Commissioners have finally come to an agreement, without any preconcerted action, with the\nEnglish proposals? Would not this jeopardize at the outset the work which we hope to bring to a successful termination?\n\nBesides, it seems very important for the extension of the system to become wide and general that it should offer to the eyes, even of the general public, only such signs as will not bewilder and alarm them, signs which are sufficiently familiar to all from their use in the ordinary alphabets, though employed in a different manner.\n\nIt is also very evident that a system of transliteration which cannot be followed without an effort could not meet the perfectly legitimate wants of linguists without many other alterations, which must, however, be relinquished, because the mere endeavour to introduce them would, in advance, condemn the attempt to the failure we should all regret.\n\nI now come to the very few points in which, as the two schemes do not agree, we have had to make a choice. The German Oriental Society has not fixed upon any sign for the long vowel \\( l \\); the method proposed by the London Society, \\( l \\) with two dots below it, seems to recommend itself. Regard to the convenience of printing does not allow the \\( l \\) to have the long mark over it; this want of symmetry with the \\( r, \u0159 \\) is of the less importance, as the long vowel \\( l \\) is more rarely used.\n\nFor the Sanskrit \\( e \\) and \\( o \\) it does not seem advisable to place the long mark over the letter; no confusion is possible. It seems preferable to reserve the use of the diacritical marks for the exceptional cases in which, either in Sanskrit or in Prakrit, one must mark the short \\( e \\) and \\( o\u2014\u0113, \u014d \\).\n\nFor the guttural \\( n \\) we propose \\( \u1e47 \\) (with a dot above). It really does not seem necessary in this case to introduce, as is proposed in the London scheme, a particular sign specially invented. The notation \\( \u1e47 \\) is widely used by Indian scholars in all countries, and as regards the objection put forward by the London Society against the placing of a diacritical mark above a consonant, it has weighed the less with us inasmuch as regarding the palatal \\( n \\) everyone\nagrees to accept the form \u014b. The sign \u014b is analogous to that of other nasal letters, and causes no surprise.\n\nBy a very singular chass\u00e9-crois\u00e9 it is the English scheme which, for the \"hissing-palatal\" (English sh), proposes \u00e7, and the German which recommends the sign \u0161, whereas the \u015b was first very generally used in English transliterations and the \u00e7 in Continental. This is, perhaps, for the very reason of this diffusion of the sign \u00e7, the most delicate point which has to be decided. The Sub-Committee does not ignore the difficulty of modifying old-established customs, and the more serious risk of mistakes between three different s. In deciding, however, in favour of the transliteration \u015b it has been from no excessive striving after symmetry, but for three reasons which may be briefly indicated.\n\nThe first is well expressed in the report of the London Society. It wisely recommends the choice of such transliterations that where the diacritical marks shall be necessarily or accidentally omitted, the pronunciation should not be too much distorted for European ears. Although this principle cannot be always acted upon, it is well to observe it as far as possible. Secondly, much stress has been laid upon the disapproval which the sign \u00e7 would certainly meet with in India; the French custom has familiarized but few persons with this character; it would take by surprise the greater number of those interested. M. B\u00fchler thinks that if an attempt were made, for example, to get the Indian Antiquary to agree to it, an invincible repugnance would be encountered. It is impossible not to recognize the gravity of this consideration.\n\nThe superiority of the sign \u015b as regards clearness and good typographical arrangement has no less impressed the Sub-Committee.\n\nThe scheme of the German Oriental Society transliterates by l (with dot below) the cerebral l. Doubtless in practice no confusion can occur between the vowel i and the cerebral l; it is, however, preferable to make a difference between the two, so that each letter of the Devan\u0101gar\u012b alphabet may have its own corresponding transliteration. The l\nwith a line below it is perfectly suitable, as the London Society proposes, for the representation of the cerebral l. On the other hand, the transliteration of the anun\u0101sika by \u1e41, in place of the simple sign ~ placed over the vowel recommends itself at once by its symmetry with the notation \u1e41, and by the advantage which it possesses of representing equally with all the other signs by a complete alphabetic character the phonetic value which it represents.\n\nOn these principles the transliteration alphabet would be constituted thus\u2014\n\n```\na a i i u \u016b r \u1e5b l \u1e37 e ai o au\nk kh g gh \u1e45\nc ch j jh \u1e45\n\u1e6d \u1e6dh \u1e0d \u1e0dh \u1e45\nt th d dh n\np ph b bh m\ny r l v \u015b \u1e63 s h l m \u1e41\nvisarga \u1e25\njihv\u0101m\u016bliya \u1e25\nupadhm\u0101niya \u1e25\n```\n\nAs regards accents, the ud\u0101tta would be represented by\n\nthe acute '  \nthe avarita by the circumflex ^  \nthe anud\u0101tta by the grave `\n\nSuch are the modest conclusions, void of pretensions to systematic perfection, which the Sub-Committee have the honour to submit. They consider that only by means of very deliberate steps will it be possible to make real progress towards the amalgamation of the rival systems. The agreement of two such powerful associations as the German Oriental Society and the Royal Asiatic Society of London, whose concurrence under existing circumstances seems assured, cannot but be a powerful lever. There is also reason to hope that proposals so eclectic and free from ambitious designs will receive further very valuable adhesions.\n\nEmile Senart.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1895.\nPROPOSALS\n\nOF THE\n\nSUB-COMMITTEE FOR THE TRANSLITERATION OF THE ARABIC ALPHABET.\n\n1.

T. Plunkett.\nON THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE ON TRANSLITERATION\n\nAT THE TENTH ORIENTAL CONGRESS.\n\nThe Report prepared by the Committee on Transliteration, and adopted by the Congress at Geneva, is published in this number of the Journal, those parts of it which are in French in the original being translated into English.\n\nThe conclusions arrived at are given in the form of two tables for the Sanskrit and the Arabic Alphabets respectively, and the Reports of the two Sub-Committees into which the Committee divided for work give in sufficient detail the reasoning which led to these results.\n\nThe Sub-Committees worked independently, and their Reports were not considered by the whole Committee till the final meeting on the last working day of the Congress, but it will be seen that with few exceptions both the Sanskrit and the Arabic sections have selected the same equivalents to represent similar sounds and corresponding letters in the two alphabets; further discussion in the same spirit which characterized the work of this Committee, and with a willingness to make compromises in order to arrive at a general agreement, may probably result in the elimination of those few anomalies. The question of spelling geographical names was discussed at the recent Sixth Geographical Congress in London this year, and the Congress invited all Geographical Societies to consider the question, and put forward their views and proposals for discussion at the next Congress; it will, therefore, be readily seen how important it is that Orientalists should, as far as possible, remove any stumbling-blocks to the general reader, and place themselves in a strong position\nfor impressing upon geographers the desirability of a scientific though necessarily simplified system for use on maps.\n\nThe principal divergence between the Sanskritists' and the Arabists' proposals is in the representation of the English sibilant sh. The Arabists propose to represent this and all the other aspirated (or so-called aspirated) consonants according to one system, and to use \u1e63, \u1e6d, \u1e0d, etc., as abbreviated forms of sh, th, dh, etc., or, if preferred, to use the latter, as is now customary in India; the Sanskritists, having one of these letters, viz. the sh, propose to represent it by \u1e63, this being a sign which the Arabists reserve for the letter \u1e63 or palatal s, which does not exist in Sanskrit or in Indian dialects.\n\nAs regards vowel sounds, the Arabists allowed the long accents on the vowels \u0113 and \u014d in Indian dialects, but the Sanskritists decided that these are unnecessary, and that it is better to mark the short vowels when required \u0113, \u014d instead of the long ones. The Arabists also proposed ay and aw for the two sounds which are represented by the Sanskritists by ai and au.\n\nIt appears to me that as regards the \u0113 and \u014d it is for the Sanskritists to decide; that also on the question of ai and au or ay and aw the Arabists, though their proposal so far as the Arabic alphabet is concerned is the more logical, might give way, but that for the sh the \u1e63 or \u1e63h possesses decided advantages over the \u1e63. Of course, there is no principle involved, it is simply a matter of convenience: the Arabists have seven letters represented in precisely the same way as sh or \u1e63; the < under a letter is more conspicuous than a simple dot; and lastly, while the geographers will almost certainly adopt sh, and may probably be persuaded to join the letters as sh, they are not likely to accept \u1e63, \u1e63, or any letter which, when the diacritical mark is omitted, becomes a simple s, and it is perhaps easier to take sh or \u1e63h for a lengthened form of \u1e63 than for the simpler \u1e63.\n\nShould we arrive at an agreement upon these points, we shall be in a very strong position from which to argue the\nquestion with the geographers and cartographers, and endeavour to induce them to adopt for place-names which have a recognized spelling a simple system of transliteration.\n\nIt is very satisfactory to know that the so-called phonetic method of spelling names having no fixed orthography which has been recommended by the Royal Geographical Society, is generally in harmony with the system of transliteration adopted at the Geneva Congress, but the geographers have, perhaps, somewhat ignored the difficulties attending any phonetic system. To the European ear two names may sound nearly alike, whilst to an Arab they are quite different, and confusion between them might be to geographers or travellers a source of serious trouble, just as Benfleet and Penfleet sound as quite different names to an Englishman, whilst an Arab can hear no difference between them. Again, the Geographical Society lays it down that the vowels are to have the same value as in Italian, ignoring the fact that both e and o have each two distinct sounds in that language, as in seno and terme and in sono and suono; no better rule, perhaps, can be laid down, but it must not be supposed that it can be in many cases anything more than a rough approximation to the sounds supposed to be represented.\n\nIn conclusion, the hope may be expressed that by the work done at Geneva real and very satisfactory progress has been made, and that we are very much nearer than we were a few years back to a general agreement as to the representation of non-European words.\n\nG. T. Plunkett.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n\n1. The Aritthaka Stone.\n\nIn the Samyutta, vol. i, p. 104, it is said of M\u0101ra, the Evil One, that to frighten and so disturb the Blessed One, he appeared to him in the form of a gigantic elephant-king, with a head like a great Aritthaka gem, tusks as of pure silver, and a trunk like the pole of a plough.\n\nThe first simile, that of the gem or rare stone, is obscure. The particular stone is not mentioned elsewhere, and in the absence of the commentary it is not easy to ascertain what stone is meant. Prof. Windisch, in vol. xlix of the \"Zeitschrift der deutschen morgenl\u00e4ndischen Gesellschaft,\" pp. 285, 286, has a most ingenious suggestion.\n\nIt is this. King Dev\u0101nam-piya-Tissa of Ceylon had had, at his coronation, three gems (ma\u1e47i) brought to him from Malaya, the mountainous district in South Ceylon. These, with other things, he sent as a present to his friend Asoka at P\u0101\u1e6daliputta. And as the head of the embassy he appointed his nephew Mah\u0101 Arittha, the son of his sister (D\u012bpavamsa, xi, 29, 31; xiv, 68). The glory of these gems, Prof. Windisch suggests, may have made so deep an impression in India that they became famous, and gave rise to the proverbial use in legend of the expression \"Mah\u0101 Arittha's gems\" as something specially wonderful. And this is what the author of our particular legend had in his mind. The elephant's head was like one of Mah\u0101 Arittha's gems.\nThe matter is of some importance: for, if this explanation be right, it would follow, of course, that (barring interpolation, which is here most unlikely) the legend itself, and probably the whole Samyutta, are, at least in their present shape, some time later than Asoka.\n\nNow one would have thought that even if the stones had created so great an impression, they would have been called after the country which produced them, or the king who sent them, rather than after the minister who brought them over. And there is a greater difficulty still. Granting all the rest of the hypothesis, the simile does not hold. The three manj\u016b are described as pabbhissara-manj\u016b (Dip. xi, 30), and their names are given as Indas\u012bla, Veluriya, and Lohitanka (sapphire, cat's-eye, and ruby: Mah\u0101 Vanssa, p. 69). The author of the legend mentions only one. Which could he mean? No one of the three is like an elephant's head; and an elephant's head is not pabbhissara, nor can it be compared to any brilliant gem. The other two similes are sound and natural. Is it not more probable that this simile was so also?\n\nIn that case the Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dhaka stone must be some stone like, either in colour or in texture, or in both, to the skin of a white elephant's head. The word Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dha is used in the Old Commentary on the 51st Pacittiya (last line) as the name of a drink mixture that was sometimes intoxicating, and sometimes unfermented. Was this of a dull grey yellowish white colour? It is also given in the dictionaries as the name of buttermilk, and of several plants, including the soap-tree (Sapindus saponaria) and garlic. In its sense of bringing luck, it might well be the name of certain rare forms of coloured rock, such as steatite or serpentine, which resemble in appearance the dirty grey white of a so-called \"white\" elephant's head. Soap-stone would fulfil these conditions, and in the description of an elephant the expression \"with a head like a great mass of soap-stone\" would be very much in place.\n\nLiterally translated the expression would merely mean \"the fateful stone,\" Ari\u1e6d\u1e6dhakam \u0101\u1e47\u1e0dam at Sumangala Vil\u0101sini,\nvol. i, p. 94, means knowledge of fate. That stones were harbingers of good and bad luck is well known in Indian folk-lore. There may well have been some such stone, whether soap-stone or opal or some other, with which a \"white\" elephant's forehead could properly be compared.\n\nI regret I have no copy of the commentary to refer to. Perhaps M. L\u00e9on Feer would give us Buddhaghosa's opinion on the point. But in face of Professor Windisch's very beautiful combination, it seemed desirable to point out at once the considerations which naturally occur to one on the other side.\n\nI may add that the pole of a plough (\u015b\u0101) is constantly used as a simile in descriptions of elephants. See Mah\u0101 Vansa, x, 4.7; Majjhima, i, 414; Vim\u0101na Vatthu, xx, 8, and xliii, 9. M. L\u00e9on Feer, in his edition of the Samyutta (Pali Text Society, 1884), has nangala-\u015b\u0101, but the correct reading is certainly nangal\u0101-\u015b\u0101, as given in the note from S\u00b9 and S\u00b3.\n\nT. W. Rhys Davids.\n\n2. The Semitic Origin of the Old Indian Alphabet.\n\nSir,\u2014It is, I believe, admitted that some of the modern alphabets of India, including, of course, the Deva-n\u0101gar\u012b, are more or less derived from the Southern or Maurya alphabet of the Asoka inscriptions. It will also be apparent, on a comparison of the inscriptions and documents of different periods, that the Sinhalese and the ancient Maldive as well as the Kawi alphabets are derived from the same Asoka alphabet. The question, therefore, of the Semitic origin of this Southern Asoka alphabet, first mooted by Professor Weber, and so ably discussed by Professor B\u00fchler in his recent essay on the subject,\u00b9 is of general interest, irrespective of its great importance in palaeographical researches. Besides, it is always a step in\n\n\u00b9 In Sitzungsberichte der Kais. Akademie der Wissenschaften in Wien: Philosophisch-Historische Classe. Band cxxii. V. Indian Studies, by George B\u00fchler. No. 3: \"On the Origin of the Indian Br\u0101hma Alphabet.\"\nadvance to ascertain to what extent the ancient Indians were indebted for their culture to Semitic races.\n\nAmongst the many weighty arguments adduced by Prof. B\u00fchler in support of the Semitic theory, he attaches great importance to the one founded on the inscription on Sir Alexander Cunningham's Eran coin, now in the British Museum. It is, so far as I know, the only inscription in the Southern alphabet yet discovered in India which reads from right to left. He considers it \"the link which was wanted in order to complete the chain of arguments proving the Semitic origin of the Br\u0101hma alphabet.\"\u00b9\n\nIn reference to this point I may be permitted to draw Prof. B\u00fchler's attention to the additional evidence which can be gathered from ancient Ceylon inscriptions, many scores of which passed under my observation when I was on the Archaeological Survey. The oldest of them are cut in pure Br\u0101hm\u012b lipi, the Southern Asoka alphabet. The characters often vary in type, and are in several instances inscribed reversedly, whilst some inscriptions have been discovered which actually read from right to left. Two such inscriptions have been published with tentative transcripts and translations\u2014one by Mr. Bell in his valuable report on the Archaeology of the Kegalle District,\u00b2 and the other by Mr. Parker in the Ceylon Literary Register.\u00b3 Mr. Bell, in discussing his inscription, mentions the existence of others like it in the Kegalle District. Mr. Parker, in his ingenious explanation of the \"retroversion\" of the letters in his inscription, says \"it is the earliest instance of what is known in Ceylon as Peralibasa. It is impossible to exhibit the freaks of the carver in a bare transliteration. Some of the letters are reversed vertically, some laterally, while two syllables have the consonants transposed, and a few letters are correctly cut.\"\u2074\n\n\u00b9 l.e., p. 3.\n\u00b2 Ceylon Sessional Papers, xix, 1892, p. 69.\n\u00b3 Vol. ii, p. 408.\n\u2074 I am indebted to Mr. D. W. Ferguson for drawing my attention to Mr. Parker's inscription.\nThis, I submit, can hardly be the true solution of the question. *Peralibasa* is not the reversion of letters so as to be read backwards from right to left. It is a way of speaking jocularly in a language obtained by the transposition of two accented syllables in a given expression, which may consist of one or more words,\\(^1\\) as, for instance, Kola\u1e41ba yanav\u0101 ('I go to Colombo') = Yala\u1e41ba konav\u0101. Ali ba\u00f1dinav\u0101 ('to tether elephants') = Bali a\u00f1dinav\u0101. Polvatte dev-medura ('the church at Polwatta') = Valpotte mev-dedura, etc.\n\nAs I have said, these are but two inscriptions out of several that have been found inscribed reversedly. Mr. Bell has noted that the one he published in his archaeological report already referred to was \"not the sole instance even in the Kegalle District.\" This oft-repeated peculiarity of so many inscriptions certainly cannot, I submit, be merely accidental or due to the ignorance of the inscribers; the more so, because of the important fact that the anomaly is to be met with only in the most ancient inscriptions, in the Southern Asoka character. I am not aware of any of a later date which read from right to left, or in which individual letters are reversedly cut. It is, therefore, but reasonable to suppose that they point to a stage when the Br\u0101hma letters were still under Semitic influence, and were written and read both from right to left and *vice versa*\u2014a period earlier than that of Asoka's edicts, and possibly earlier even than that of the Eran coin, which Prof. B\u00fchler assigns to a date \"not very far distant from the middle of the third century B.C.\"\n\nIf, on closer inspection, the supposition I have put forward holds good, the inscriptions show the extent to which the art of writing had already spread in the third century B.C., and also go to corroborate the hitherto disputed statement in the Sinhalese annals regarding the intercourse between India and Ceylon before the introduction of\n\n\\(^1\\) See Mr. Goonetilleke's interesting article in the \"Orientalist\" of Jan. 1884 (vol. i, pt. 1), pp. 5\u201312.\nBuddhism by Mahindo, the son of Asoka.\\(^1\\) In the absence of facsimiles, however, it is not possible to discuss the inscriptions in detail; and I must, therefore, content myself for the present with calling attention to the new and valuable evidence which they seem to afford.\n\nLet me conclude this note by mentioning the suggestion made to me by Prof. Rhys Davids, as to the possibility of the Indians having borrowed their Br\u0101hma alphabet from the Sinhalese, who in turn may have got it from the Semitic people then trading in Ceylon, for Ceylon in those olden days is said to have been the centre of Eastern commerce.\\(^2\\)\u2014Yours faithfully,\n\nDon Martino de Zilva Wickremasinghe.\n\n3. Mahuan's Account of Bengal.\n\nNetherclay House, Taunton,\nSept. 20th, 1895.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014I beg to offer a few remarks on Mr. Phillips's interesting article in the July number of the Journal on Mahuan's account of Bengal.\n\nCheh-ti-gan. This corresponds precisely to Chittagong (Chatg\u00e1nw). At that place a traveller proceeding to the interior would transfer himself from a sea-going vessel to a country boat to go up the Meghna, just as the Chinese pilgrim describes. The distance, 166 miles to Sonarg\u00e1on, is also very nearly correct. Sonarg\u00e1on, however, is not \"Suvarna-gramma, or Golden Town,\" but Suvarnak\u00e1ramgr\u00e1ma, or Goldsmith's Village. The site is not unknown, as Mr. Phillips supposes. It is on the Meghna, about twelve miles east of Dacca. A very interesting account of the ruins and remains at this place by Dr. Wise will be found in the Bengal Asiatic Society's Journal, vol. xliii, p. 82.\n\n\\(^1\\) See Mr. Parker's interesting Report on Archaeological Discoveries at Tissa-mah\u0101r\u0101ma (Journal Ceylon Branch of the Roy. As. Soc., vol. viii, pt. i, pp. 70\u201375), where he has arrived at the same conclusions as I have done here.\n\n\\(^2\\) See \"Ceylon,\" by Sir James E. Tennent, vol. i, pp. 571, etc. (Ceylon as known to the Phoenicians).\nThe Chinese traveller notes that the \"Kingdom of Bengala\" is thirty-five stages, or 105 miles, south-west from Son\u00e1rg\u00e1on. This distance and direction bring us, as the crow flies, to the eastern boundary of the Sark\u00e1r, or fiscal division, of S\u00e1tg\u00e1on, and forty miles further in the same line is the site of the famous ancient city of S\u00e1tg\u00e1on, which if not precisely the capital of Bengal was the residence of one of the provincial governors, and the largest and most important commercial town and trading port in the country. S\u00e1tg\u00e1on is, I think, beyond doubt the place meant by Mahuan. He is, of course, mistaken in asserting that the people were all Muhammadans, though the officials and leading men were so.\n\nThe Tang-ka is the ordinary silver coin now more generally known as the rupee. The Bengalis, however, still use the term \u1e6d\u0101nk\u0101 or \u1e6d\u0101k\u0101 for rupee.\n\nAs to the cotton fabrics, it is difficult to decide what is meant by Man-ch\u0113-ti and Hin-pe\u00ec-tung-tali. Pi-chih can hardly be for Betteela, as this, according to Yule's glossary, is a Portuguese word, Beatilha\u2014\"a nun's veil,\" and Mahuan visited India before the Portuguese came there. If, as appears from Mr. Phillips's note, the ch is a transliteration of t or ti, I would suggest the Bengali and Hindustani bu\u1e6di, or in full bu\u1e6did\u0101r, the name of muslin with flowers worked on it.\n\nSha-na-keih is apparently the material known to Europeans in the sixteenth century as 'san\u00e8s' or 'sahnes,' Persian sahn (see J.A.S.B., vol. xlii, p. 216). A great deal of it was made at Balasore in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It was a white cotton cloth of rather coarse texture.\n\nSha-ta-urh seems to be correctly identified with Chaut\u00e1r, and Mo-hei-mo-leh with malmal, perhaps the malmali sh\u0101hi or royal muslin made at Dacca.\n\nThe word K\u00e1n-siao-su-lu-nai is given as the name of a class of musicians. I know of no class or caste of musicians so called in any part of Bengal, but I would suggest that\nwe have here two words indicative of musical instruments. Su-lu-nai seems to be the Persian \u0633\u0631\u0646\u0627\u06cc 'a flute or pipe,' a word in common use in Bengal; and if the Chinese syllables can be so transliterated, the former part of the word would be khanjari, the Bengali name for a tambourine. Thus the combined word would be khanjari-surn\u00e1ti, or 'tambourine and pipe,' which corresponds to the description of the instruments used. It is noteworthy also that these are the actual instruments used by the musicians in Bengal in the present day (see Dr. Wise's \"Notes on Dacca,\" p. 253).\n\nAs to the identification of Gai-ya-szu-ting with Ghiy\u00e1suddin, the Chinese date seems to be wrong, as there are no coins or inscriptions of this king later than A.H. 799, corresponding to A.D. 1396. But the other king may, perhaps, be identified as follows: In A.D. 1415 (=A.H. 817\u2013818) Jal\u00e1luddin was king, but his reign did not commence till A.H. 818, the end of March, 1415. In the former part of the year 1415 his father, the Hindu Raja K\u00e1ns, was apparently still alive. Might it not, therefore, be possible that the Chinese historian has mixed up the two, and made out of K\u00e1ns and Jal\u00e1luddin a joint name, K\u00e1ns uddin, which he represents by Kien-hut-ding. A Chinese would not be aware of the incongruity of a mixed Hindu and Musulman name. Though Lane-Poole, adopting the modern Arabic custom, writes Ghiy\u00e1s ad-din and Jal\u00e1l ad-din; in India, where Arabic is only known as an ancient classical tongue, the final u of Arabic nominatives is still retained in proper names, and we still say Jal\u00e1luddin (i.e. Jal\u00e1lu'd-din), Mun\u00edruddin, Ghiy\u00e1suddin, not ad.\u2014Yours truly,\n\nJOHN BEAMES.\n\n4. EPIGRAPHIC DISCOVERIES IN MYSORE.\n\nThe following is taken from The Academy of Sept. 21st:\u2014\n\nVienna, Sept. 3rd, 1895.\n\nMr. L. Rice, C.I.E., the director of the Archaeological Department in Mysore, who, two years ago, discovered the\nA\u015boka Edicts of Sidd\u0101pur, has again made three most valuable finds. He has kindly forwarded to me photographs and transcripts of his new inscriptions; and, with his permission, I give a preliminary notice of their contents, which, indeed, possess a great interest for all students of Indian antiquities.\n\nThe best preserved among the three documents is a long metrical Sanskrit Pra\u015basti or Eulogy on the excavation of a tank near an ancient \u015aaiva temple at Sth\u0101na-Kund\u016bra, begun by the Kadamba king K\u0101kusthavarman, and completed in the reign of his son \u015a\u0101ntivarman. The author of the poem, which is written in the highest K\u0101vy\u0101 style, was a \u015aaiva poet called Kubja, who, as he tells us, transferred his composition to the stone with his own hands. He devotes nearly the whole of his work to an account of the early Kadamba kings, regarding whom hitherto little was known except from their land grants, published by Dr. Fleet in the Indian Antiquary. Like the land grants, the Pra\u015basti states that the Kadambas were a Brahminical family, belonging to the M\u0101navya Gotra and descended from H\u0101ritiputra. But it adds that they derived their name from a Kadamba tree which grew near their home. In this family, Kubja goes on, was born one May\u016bra\u015barman, who went to K\u0101\u00f1c\u012b in order to study, and there was involved in a quarrel with its Pallava rulers. He took up arms against them, and after a prolonged and severe struggle he became the ruler of a territory between the Amar\u0101rnava and Prem\u0101ra. May\u016bra\u015barman left his possessions to his son K\u0101\u1e45ga, who adopted instead of the Brahminical termination \u015barman of his father's name, that which distinguishes the Kshatriyas, and was called K\u0101\u1e45gavarman. Next followed K\u0101\u1e45ga's son Bhagiratha, who had two sons\u2014Raghu and K\u0101kusthavarman. Both became successively rulers of the Kadamba territory; and K\u0101kustha's successor was his son \u015a\u0101ntivarman, during whose reign Kubja composed his poem, while residing in an excellent village (varas\u0101sana) granted by that king. The last two kings are known through Dr. Fleet's Kadamba land grants,\nbut the names of their predecessors appear for the first time in Mr. Rice's Pr\u0101\u015basti. New also is the account of the manner in which this branch of the Kadambas rose to power. It seems perfectly credible, since Brahminical rebellions and successful usurpations have occurred more than once in the Dekhan both in ancient and in modern times. The change of the termination in Ka\u1e45gavarm\u0101n's name, and the adoption of the names of mythical warriors by his descendants, may be due to a marriage of the Brahman May\u016bra with the daughter of a chief or king belonging to the Solar race, whereby his son and his offspring would become members of the Kshatriya caste. The inscriptions show that such alliances were by no means uncommon in ancient times.\n\nIncidentally, the Pr\u0101\u015basti mentions besides the Pallavas two other royal races: \"the great B\u0101\u1e47as,\" on whom May\u016bra\u015barman is said to have levied tribute; and, what is of much greater interest, the Guptas, whom K\u0101kusthavarman is said to have assisted by his advice. The verse referring to the Guptas occurs in line 8 of the Pr\u0101\u015basti, and I give its translation in full:\n\n\"That sun among princes (K\u0101kustha) awakened by the rays of his daughter (S\u0101vitr\u012b-Sarasvat\u012b 'personified intelligence'), the glorious races of the Guptas and other kings, that may be likened to lotus-beds, since their affection, regard, love, and respect resemble the filaments [of the flower], and since many princes attend them, like bees [eager for honey].\"\n\nThe Guptas, who were attended by many princes, hungering for their gifts as the bees seek the honey of the lotus, are, of course, the Imperial Guptas; and the Gupta king whom K\u0101kusthavarman \"awakened by the rays of his intelligence\" is in all probability Samudragupta. As far as is known at present, he was the only Gupta who extended his conquests to the Dekhan. His court-poet, Harishena, alleges in the Allahabad Pr\u0101\u015basti that Samudragupta imprisoned and afterwards liberated \"all the princes of the Dekhan,\" and mentions twelve among them by name.\nSamudragupta's reign came to an end sometime before 400 A.D. Hence K\u00e2kusthavarman, too, would seem to have ruled in the second half of the fourth century, and Mr. Rice's new inscription probably belongs to the beginning of the fifth. Its characters exactly resemble those of K\u00e2kusthavarman's copper-plates, which Dr. Fleet long ago assigned to the fifth century on pal\u00e6ographical grounds. The two estimates thus agree very closely, and mutually support each other.\n\nIn addition to these valuable results, Mr. Rice's new inscription furnishes an interesting contribution to the religious history of Southern India. As all the land grants of the early Kadambas are made in favour of Jaina ascetics or temples, and as they begin with an invocation of the Arhat, it has been held hitherto that these kings had adopted the Jaina creed. Kubja's Pra\u015basti makes this doubtful, and shows at all events that they patronized also Brahmans and a \u015aaiva place of worship. An incidental remark in the concluding verses, which describe the temple of Sth\u00e2na-Kund\u00fbra, proves further that \u015aaivism was in the fifth century by no means a new importation in Southern India. Kubja mentions S\u0101takar\u1e47i as the first among the benefactors of the \u015aaiva temple. This name carries us back to the times of the Andhras, and indicates that \u015aaivism flourished in Southern India during the first centuries of our era.\n\nMr. Rice's two other finds are older than the Pra\u015basti, and possess, in spite of their defective preservation, very considerable interest. They are found on the one and the same stone pillar, and show nearly the same characters, which are closely allied to those of the latest Andhra inscriptions at Nasik and Amar\u0101vati. The upper one, which is also the older one, contains an edict in Prakrit of the P\u00e2li type, by which the Mah\u00e2r\u00e2ja H\u00e2ritiputta S\u00e2ta-kanni, the joy of the Vinhukadadu\u1e6du family, assigns certain villages to a Brahman. This Satakanni is already known through a short votive inscription, found by Dr. Burgess at Banav\u00e2si, which records the gift of the image of a N\u00e2ga,\na tank, and a Buddhist Vih\u0101ra by the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja's daughter. The new document, which contains also an invocation of a deity, called Mattapattideva, probably a local form of \u015aiva, teaches us that S\u0101takanni was the king of Banav\u0101si; and it furnishes further proof for the early prevalence of Brahmanism in Mysore. It certainly must be assigned to the second half of the second century of our era. For the palaeographer it possesses a great interest, as it is the first P\u0101li document found in which the double consonants are not expressed by single ones, but throughout are written in full. Even H\u0101ritiputta S\u0101takanni's Banav\u0101si inscription shows the defective spelling of the clerks.\n\nThe second inscription on this pillar, which immediately follows the first, and, to judge from the characters, cannot be much later, likewise contains a Brahminical land grant, issued by a Kadamba king of Banav\u0101si, whose name is probably lost. Its language is Mah\u0101r\u0101sh\u1e6dr\u012b Prakrit, similar to that of the Pallava land grant published in the first volume of the Epigraphia Indica, and Sanskrit in the final benediction. It furnishes additional proof that, at least in Southern India, the Mah\u0101r\u0101sh\u1e6dr\u012b became temporarily the official language, after the Prakrit of the P\u0101li type went out and before the Sanskrit came in. This period seems to fall in the third and fourth centuries A.D.\n\nThe numerous and various points of interest which the new epigraphic discoveries in Mysore offer, entitle Mr. Rice to the hearty congratulations of all Sanskritists, and to their warm thanks for the ability and indefatigable zeal with which he continues the archaeological explorations in the province confided to his care. To the expression of these sentiments I would add the hope that he may move the Mysore Government to undertake excavations at Sth\u0101na-Kund\u016bra, or other promising ancient sites, which no doubt will yield further important results.\n\nG.

Obituary Notices.\n\nProfessor von Roth.\u2014Sanskrit learning has suffered a severe loss by the death of Prof. Roth, the leading Vedic scholar of Germany. Only a year ago we had to record in the pages of this Journal the decease of one of his most distinguished pupils, Prof. W. D. Whitney, the chief of the Vedists of America. Both these great scholars were honorary members of this Society.\n\nRudolf Roth died on the 23rd of June at T\u00fcbingen, having been one of the teaching staff of that University for exactly half a century. He was born at Stuttgart on April 3rd, 1821. Matriculating at T\u00fcbingen, he passed through the regular course of Protestant theology. Subsequently he, for a time, held a curacy (cicariat) somewhere in W\u00fcrttemberg. At T\u00fcbingen Roth turned his attention to Oriental studies under the guidance of Heinrich Ewald, who, though famous as the greatest Semitic scholar of the century, was also a Sanskritist in the earlier part of his career. The eminent comparative philologist, August Schleicher, born in the same year as Roth, was a pupil of Ewald at the same time. After taking his degree of Ph.D., Roth repaired to Paris. Here he came under the stimulating influence of the great French Orientalist, Eug\u00e8ne Burnouf, who was not merely the only scholar at that time possessing a comprehensive acquaintance with Vedic literature, but an eminent pioneer in Avestic research. Another distinguished pupil of those days who owed much to the teaching of Burnouf was Prof. Max M\u00fcller. From\nParis Roth came over to England, where, at the East India House and the Bodleian, he devoted himself to the examination and copying of Vedic MSS. Returning to T\u00fcbingen in 1845, he settled there as Privatdocent for Oriental Philology. In the following year he published a small volume containing three treatises on the Literature and History of the Veda. This was an epoch-making work, and became the starting-point of Vedic research. The information here given by Roth is almost entirely based on his study of MS. material, for till then the only portion of Vedic literature published was the first eighth of the Rigveda, edited a few years before by Rosen; and the only account of the Vedas was the essay published in 1805 by Colebrooke, the true pioneer of Sanskrit philology. In 1848 Roth became extraordinary professor. In 1856 he was promoted to an ordinary professorship, being at the same time appointed chief of the University library. He already bore among Orientalists a distinguished name, which spread the fame of T\u00fcbingen to every country where the ancient language and literature of India is studied. He had, in 1852, published, with valuable elucidations, an edition of Y\u0101ska's Nirukta, the most ancient Vedic commentary in existence, dating perhaps from the fifth century B.C.\n\nThe first volume of the great work with which Roth's name will ever be associated had appeared in 1855. This was the large Sanskrit Dictionary printed under the auspices of the Imperial Academy of St. Petersburg. The seventh and last volume was not completed till 1875, about a quarter of a century after the work was first taken in hand. The responsibility for the classical Sanskrit portion of the dictionary was assumed by Dr. B\u00f6htlingk, who, from his vast knowledge of the literature of the post-Vedic period, was better qualified for the work than any other scholar of the time. Roth undertook the task of dealing with the Vedic period. His share not only forms the most important and valuable contribution hitherto made towards solving the great difficulties of Vedic interpretation, but\nis also the foundation on which nearly all subsequent researches on the language, institutions, religion, and mythology of the Veda are based. Roth is, therefore, to be regarded as the real founder of Vedic philology. Nearly half his life as a scholar was devoted to the dictionary. It must be remembered that Roth was the first\u2014excepting Benfey in his glossary to the S\u0101ma Veda (1848)\u2014to handle the lexicography of the Veda. Only those who have some acquaintance with the subject can adequately appreciate the amount of time and labour Roth must have spent in indexing, in comparing parallel passages to ascertain meanings, and in arranging the material logically and historically.\n\nNo man could have been better qualified, both by natural gifts and by preparation, for an undertaking of such magnitude. In him imaginative power was combined with intellectual clearness, keenness, and penetration, as well as controlled by accuracy of scientific method, to a degree perhaps never surpassed among scholars. Conscious that his own share in the great dictionary was the work of a pioneer, Roth anticipated that it would soon become antiquated. Comparatively little, however, of the results at which he arrived have been upset by the criticism and research of younger scholars. There can be no more striking evidence of his genius than this. May later generations never be forgetful of the debt which Vedic scholarship owes to the labours of one of the greatest of the many great scholars Germany has produced!\n\nIn the year following the completion of the first volume of the lexicon, Roth brought out his edition of the Atharva Veda in collaboration with his former pupil, the late Prof. Whitney, who, as well as Prof. Albrecht Weber, contributed much valuable material to the dictionary.\n\nOf Roth\u2019s minor works it is here perhaps only necessary to mention his catalogue of the Indian MSS. in the University Library of T\u00fcbingen (1865), his treatise on the Atharva Veda in Kashmir (1875), and his metrical translations of typical Vedic hymns in association with his\ntwo pupils, Geldner and Kaegi, in *Siebenzig Lieder des Rigveda* (1875). He contributed many important and valuable articles to various journals, especially that of the German Oriental Society. These articles deal chiefly with the religion, mythology, textual criticism, and interpretation of the Veda. The most noteworthy of them treat of Brahma and the Brahmanes (*ZDMG.*, vol. i, pp. 66\u201386), the highest gods of the Aryan nations (vi, pp. 67\u201377), Soma (xxxv, pp. 680\u201392), the habitat of the Soma plant (xxxviii, pp. 134\u20139), the myth of Soma and the eagle (xxxvi, pp. 353\u201360), learned tradition in antiquity, especially in India (xxi, pp. 1\u20139), the Pada and Samhita text of the Rigveda (Kuhn\u2019s *Zeitschrift*, xxvi, pp. 45\u201368), the orthography of the Veda (*ZDMG.*, xlviii, pp. 101\u201319 and 676\u201384), the shortening of the ends of words in the Veda (Trans. Seventh Oriental Congress, Aryan section, pp. 1\u201310), Indian fire implements (*ZDMG.*, xliii, 590\u20135).\n\nClearness, directness, and conciseness were characteristic of all that he wrote. Hardly any of his articles exceed twenty pages in length, many of them being considerably shorter. Most other scholars would have devoted twice the space to the treatment of the same questions without gaining anything in matter or lucidity.\n\nThe one department outside the range of Vedic studies which particularly interested Roth, was medicine. Hence the medical articles in the great dictionary are from his pen. He also wrote on Indian medicine as represented by Caraka in the Journal of the German Oriental Society (vol. xxvi); and his last contribution to that journal, published this year, is a notice of an Indian edition of the well-known medical writer V\u0101gbha\u1e6da.\n\nRoth occasionally lectured on the Avesta; and various distinguished Zend scholars, such as Geldner and Mills, have been his pupils. He wrote several articles on Avestan subjects for the Journal of the German Oriental Society. The most important of these deal with the legend of Feridun in India and Iran (vol. ii, pp. 216\u201330), the legend of Jemshid, the Vedic god of the dead, Yama, being\ncompared with Yima (iv, pp. 417-33), contributions to the interpretation of the Avesta (xxv, pp. 1-21 and 215-31), the calendar of the Avesta and the so-called Gahanbar (xxxiv, pp. 698-720), and the souls of the middle region in Parseeism (xxxvii, pp. 223-9).\n\nIn addition to all his other University work, Roth was in the habit of giving a course of lectures every alternate year on the history of religions, to large and appreciative audiences of theological students.\n\nIn accordance with the excellent German custom, the jubilee of Roth's degree was celebrated two years ago by the publication in his honour of a Festgruss, containing contributions on Oriental subjects from forty-four scholars. The list of contributors contains the names of nearly all the leading Sanskritists of several countries. Most of them were his former pupils; indeed, hardly any other Orientalist can have had a larger number of distinguished scholars among his disciples. Among his pupils, besides those already referred to, may be mentioned Professors E. Kuhn, of Munich; H. Zimmer, of Greifswald; L. v. Schroeder, of Innsbruck; R. Garbe, of K\u00f6nigsberg; R. Lanman, of Harvard; the late Martin Haug, of Munich; and Dr. M. A. Stein, of Lahore. About eight years ago Roth numbered among the members of his Vedic class an old gentleman upwards of sixty years of age. Having been one of the professor's earliest pupils, he had returned to T\u00fcbingen to continue his Oriental studies under his former teacher after an intermission of forty years. This is probably a unique experience among professors of Sanskrit.\n\nProfessor Roth was ennobled by the late King of W\u00fcrttemberg, in recognition of his great services to Oriental scholarship. Many academies and societies esteemed it an honour to count him among their members. Edinburgh, however, seems to have been the only foreign university which conferred upon him an honorary degree. But a scholar like Roth could well dispense with distinctions of this kind, nor was he the man to attribute much weight to them. Though he received various honourable calls to\nother seats of learning, he refused them all, attaching, like all true scholars, little importance to pecuniary advantage, and preferring to live and die at his old university in his beautiful native land of Swabia, the birthplace of so many famous men of Germany.\n\nArthur A. Macdonell.\n\nSir Thomas Francis Wade, G.C.M.G., K.C.B., etc.\u2014It is some twenty-five years ago that I first met Sir\u2014he was then Mr.\u2014Thomas Wade: he had come down to Shanghai from Peking, where he was Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires, and was staying on business at the British Consulate. I was then Honorary Librarian of the North China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, and I went to see him to get some information about his own publications. This information was given to me with the graceful, though dignified, manner which was one of the characteristics of Mr. Wade, whether walking in the dust of Peking or in the fog of Lower Berkeley Street. When I last heard of him he had just been the President of your learned Society, and was the bearer of the agreeable tidings that I had been appointed one of your honorary members in the place of my illustrious friend Ernest Renan.\n\nWade began life as a soldier, being the eldest son of a soldier, Colonel Thomas Wade, C.B. The exact date of his birth I never could ascertain, but it was somewhere about 1818. After being educated at Harrow, he entered the Army in 1838, as ensign in the 81st Foot. The Opium War, during which he took an active part as an officer in the 42nd Highlanders and the 98th Foot, was his first opportunity to learn Chinese. The cession of Hongkong to Great Britain by the Treaty of Nanking (1842) offered young Wade a new field of action, when he was appointed an interpreter to the garrison of the island. He retired from the military service as a lieutenant in the 98th Foot only in 1847, when made an Assistant Chinese Secretary. Wade had once more occasion to resume his profession as a soldier when the Imperial troops were, in April, 1854,\nsurrounding the foreign settlement of Shanghai, behaving like, if not worse than, the T'ai-ping rebels in the native city, threatening to loot the property and to destroy the lives of the Western Devils who were inhabiting the \"Muddy Flat\" bordering on the Hwang-poo River. Foreign residents, officers and sailors from H.M.'s ships *Encounter* and *Grecian*, from the U.S. sloop *Plymouth*, as well as from the merchantmen in harbour, stormed, on the 4th of April, the camp of the Chinese troops; and Mr. Wade took in a gallant manner his part in a severe fight which cleared Shanghai from unpleasant neighbours, but cost the small European community two killed and sixteen wounded.\n\nMr. Wade had left Hongkong in 1852, being appointed Vice-Consul at Shanghai. The T'ai-ping had taken the native city on the 7th September, 1853: the three chief Consuls, with the agreement of the Chinese authorities, made arrangements in June, 1854, for a set of Custom House rules, which were to be carried out by three intendants\u2014Mr. Wade for the British, Mr. L. Carr for the Americans, and M. Arthur Smith for the French. In fact, shortly after Wade gave up the position to Horatio Nelson Lay, predecessor of Sir Robert Hart, as Inspector-General of the Chinese Imperial Maritime Customs. Sir John Bowring, Governor of Hongkong, then sent Wade on a special mission to Cochin-China. The two embassies of Lord Elgin, and the two wars with China which were brought to an end by the convention of peace signed at Peking on the 3rd of October, 1860, were new opportunities to utilize Wade's knowledge of the Chinese language. I may say that from this time is beginning the curious parallelism between the careers of Wade and Parkes, who were destined to occupy, both of them, the post of Minister Plenipotentiary at Peking.\n\nThe writer of the obituary published in *The Times* (weekly edition, August 9, 1895) rightly says: \"A full biography of Sir Thomas Wade would be at the same time a history of our diplomatic relations with China during a period of forty years, for in all our important dealings with the\nChinese Government during that time he played a by no means insignificant part. The only other Englishman, perhaps, who had anything like the same experience, and who displayed similar remarkable qualities in the bewildering world of Chinese politics, was his friend and colleague Sir Harry Parkes, who died ten years ago at the comparatively early age of 57. Both had a remarkable power of making themselves thoroughly acquainted with the Chinese language, Chinese character, Chinese ways, and especially Chinese trickery, and both were thereby able to render very valuable services to their own Government. But in natural character and tendencies they were very different. Wade was more a man of study, and Parkes more a man of action; and when the two were working together in a subordinate capacity, the former naturally did most of the correspondence and the latter more of the interviewing and the outdoor work, though it must be admitted that each could play the r\u00f4le of the other when any such necessity arose, and on many occasions the studious Wade showed that in activity and daring he could hardly be surpassed by Parkes himself. The two men differed also in their modes in dealing with the Chinese. Parkes was naturally inclined to be authoritative and domineering, whilst Wade was generally disposed to temper his tenacity with patience and conciliation. Yet the two men, though they were in a certain sense rivals and often crossed each other's path, never displayed any unworthy jealousy of each other. In one of his early letters Parkes writes: 'Wade and myself share a tent: he is a right good fellow, is Wade.' That familiar phrase indicates briefly, but graphically, the relations which existed between them, and it will be cordially re-echoed by many who knew Sir Thomas Wade personally and who now mourn his loss.\"\n\nWhen Sir Harry Parkes was, on the 13th July, 1883, appointed Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to His Majesty the Emperor of China, and Chief Superintendent of Trade, Wade wrote to him from England: \"You start fair-fairer than most men in one respect\u2014you have\nthe full confidence of the community,\" adding, \"You know the country and people better than anyone alive... May you have strength to endure.\"\u00b9\n\nIn 1861 Wade was made a C.B., and appointed (1862) subsequently to the most important position of Chinese Secretary and Translator to the British Legation in China, which some years later was filled by the remarkable sinologue William Frederick Mayers, cut short in the prime of life. During the absence of Sir Frederick Bruce and of Sir Rutherford Alcock, Wade acted as Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires from June, 1864, to November, 1865, and from November, 1869, to July, 1871, when he was at last appointed Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, and Chief Superintendent of British Trade in China. In the meantime he married (1868) Amelia, daughter of Sir John Herschel. Certainly the culminating point of Wade's career was the Convention signed at Chefoo, 13th September, 1876, for the settlement of the Yun-nan outrage, that is to say the unwonted attack on Col. Horace Browne's special mission from Burmah and the murder of the interpreter, Augustus Raymond Margary.\n\nThe British community in China did not at the time render full justice to the exertions of the distinguished diplomate, both at Peking and in London, when he returned home. Foreigners are greatly inclined in the Far East to believe that the whole world has only to think of the problems concerning their own interests; they forget too often that the Legation is but an instrument of the home authorities, which have to study, not one point, but to survey the imperial policy at large. Wade was in these days very strongly attacked by the Press in China, but Mr. Disraeli, a good judge in the matter, never failed to speak in Parliament in the highest terms of the\n\n\u00b9 \"The Life of Sir Harry Parkes\" ... By Stanley Lane-Poole. London, 1894, ii, p. 364.\nrepresentative of Great Britain at the capital of the Celestial Empire.\n\nWade had been appointed a K.C.B. in November, 1875, and he was made G.C.M.G. in 1889. Six years before (1883) he had retired on a well-earned pension.\n\nDuring his sojourn in China, Wade had gathered a very extensive collection of valuable Chinese books, which was only rivalled by Wylie's rare library at Shanghai. This collection he gave to the University of Cambridge, where he received in 1886 the honorary degree of D.Litt., and was nominated in 1888 the first Professor of Chinese. For some months past Sir Thomas was ailing at his house, 5, Salisbury Villas, Cambridge, and there he slept his last this summer, on Wednesday, 31st July.\n\nAs a Chinese scholar, Wade is known by his method to learn the Chinese language. He first began his series of contributions by the Hsin Ching Lu,\\(^1\\) published at Hongkong in 1859, followed up by the progressive course called the Tzu-erh Chi:\\(^2\\) this latter book has been universally used both at the British Legation and in the Customs service; it has done more to diffuse the Peking dialect than any other book, and though I have the strongest objection to the use of this dialect in preference to the language spoken at Nanking, it has nevertheless greatly contributed to the knowledge of Chinese at large. It has been found necessary to give a new edition of the Tzu-erh Chi, which was published in 1886, at Shanghai, at the expense of the Chinese Imperial Maritime Customs.\\(^3\\)\n\nThough chiefly known by this work, Sir Thomas Wade\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The Hsin Ching Lu, or \"Book of Experiments,\" being the first of a series of contributions to the study of Chinese.

Notices of Books.\n\nHand-book of Colloquial Tibetan. A Practical Guide to the Language of Central Tibet. In Three Parts. By Graham Sandberg, B.A. Calcutta, 1894.\n\nMr. Sandberg announces in the preface of this interesting volume that it \"is designed to afford a complete guide to the Vernacular of Tibet Proper,\" and that \"it is the lingua franca of the Tibetan Empire which has been analysed and codified in this Hand-book; not the dialectic forms spoken in corners of the country, as in L'adak, Lahul, and Sikkim, but the general Vernacular current in the heart of the land, and which will carry the traveller from west to east and from north-east to south.\"\n\nThe first part of the Hand-book (pp. 9-127) is devoted to the grammar of this Tibetan lingua franca. It is beyond the purpose of this review to examine in detail this subject, which is not, however, quite so new as the author leads one to believe. \"Up to the present date,\" he says in his preface, \"no grammar of the colloquial language has been placed before the public. Jaeschke, indeed, in his learned works, has fully dissected the old classical language.\"\n\n\u00b9 The Army of the Chinese Empire: its two great divisions, the Bannermen or National Guard and the Green Standard or Provincial Troops; their organization, locations, pay, condition, etc. (Chinese Repository, xx, May and June, 1861.)\n\n\u00b2 Note on the condition and government of the Chinese Empire in 1849.

China, 15th August, 1859. Pamph. 8vo.\nMr. Sandberg overlooks the two works on colloquial Tibetan published by Mr. Jaeschke, the lithographed grammar issued in 1865 from the Mission Press of Kyelang, and the Tibetan grammar of 1883, published in Tr\u00fcbner and Co.'s Collection of Simplified Grammars of the principal Asiatic and European Languages. These works, though perhaps not as complete as the present one, and more specially devoted to Western Tibetan speech, are extremely valuable for a knowledge of any kind of colloquial Tibetan.\n\nIt is quite true that, these two books excepted, all other grammars of the Tibetan language, written by foreigners, whether Csoma, Schmidt, or Foucaux, are devoted solely to the classical language, which was very probably, I might say certainly, never spoken in the country, and is only a servile translation of Indian Buddhist languages into Tibetan.\n\nThe system adopted by Mr. Sandberg for the transliteration of Tibetan sounds is practically that of Jaeschke, and of Major Lewin in his \"Manual of Tibetan.\" It is to my mind open to grave objections, for I believe in either the use of the native character or in a purely phonetic transcription, but as the author thinks (p. 369) my own method \"most extraordinary,\" the less, perhaps, I say on the subject the better. I cannot, however, pass over what he there says about a Tibetan syllabary giving the pronunciation of Lh'asa, Bat'ang, and the Ts'arong (the two latter districts in Eastern Tibet), published in my \"Land of the Lamas\" (pp. 368-370), and which he thinks was given me by some Tibetan-speaking Mongol, and is \"fanciful\" in the extreme. As a matter of fact, these sounds were given me by a highly educated Tibetan from Lh'asa, who, in 1889, was Secretary to the native King of Chala, then living at Ta-chien-lu, and were written down by me with the greatest care in the presence of Monseigneur Felix Biet and several fathers of the Catholic Mission of Tibet, all of whom spoke Tibetan with great fluency, and who controlled each of my phonetic transcriptions.\nAs for my own knowledge of Tibetan, it was gained during seven years of nearly continuous intercourse with people of all classes of society, from high lamas and officials to shepherds and beggars, and from Amdo to Nyach'uk'a, from Jyad\u00e9 to Ta-chien-lu. For four years of this time I studied at Peking under a lama born within fifteen miles of Lh'asa, and who had come to Peking for the first time a year before I met him. I have conversed month after month with Lh'asans, and they have all said that my pronunciation approximated more closely their own than that of any other part of the country, and not infrequently they wondered, not knowing where I had learnt it, at my having been able to stay long enough in their country to acquire it. Such Tibetan as I can speak is essentially a lingua franca, what the Chinese call tsa hua, and though it may differ somewhat from Mr. Sandberg's, I have always been able to make myself understood with it throughout the country. So much for myself and for the value of my opinion. I advance it, however, with all due deference for the learned author's views, and with no desire to appear either hypercritical or dogmatic; we are both probably right as far as we go.\n\nIt is impossible here to enter into the vexed question of tones, but I think that it is wrong to compare, as does Mr. Sandberg (p. 13), Burmese and Tibetan tones with those of the Chinese language; in fact, I would like to see no mention of tones in Tibetan\u2014they have been made the bugbear of Chinese, and there is absolutely no reason for introducing them here, for colloquial Tibetan, and also colloquial Chinese to a certain extent, ignores them. The point of resemblance between Tibetan and Chinese in this respect is not, I should say, the use of tones, of which nearly all natives are profoundly ignorant, but the universal habit of joining two synonymous but different sounding words, or some qualifying word together, for making what Mr. Sandberg calls (p. 117) \"expanded forms\" whenever there is danger of the meaning being in doubt, a practice recognized by our author on a subsequent page (p. 17), but not given, I think, proper prominence in his book.\nThus, in the examples given by Mr. Sandberg (p. 15), of \"says\" (ser), \"a nail\" (gzer), and \"gold\" (gser), the difficulty is avoided in the same way in both China and Tibet: in the former country the speaker would say t'ieh ting-tszu \"an iron nail,\" if he feared being misunderstood, and a Tibetan would say ser-gi chan-zer \"a gold nail,\" if ser-ser (for I think I am right in saying that gzer is never homophonous with gser) appeared to him ambiguous. The original monosyllabism of Tibetan, and, for that matter, of Chinese and other kindred languages, is not, I believe, as well established a fact as the author seems to think, and I am strongly inclined to believe that they were never purely monosyllabic at any period of their history.\n\nI must also call attention to the constant use which the author makes of the words di and de, which he here (p. 20) takes for the definite article, though correctly interpreted elsewhere (pp. 37 and 85, etc.) as the pronouns hdi \"this\" and de \"that.\" They are not everywhere used so frequently as our author believes; for example, I think most Tibetans would say go gyab \"shut the door,\" not go di gyak, and me tug \"don't touch it,\" instead of dhe-la lakpa ma t'uk, literally, \"to that your hand do not place.\" In Eastern Tibetan, by the way, it is interesting to find that, so as to clearly differentiate the sounds of these two words, the word hdi is pronounced a-di; thus one hears a-di shog \"come here.\" A similar expedient has been resorted to in other parts of the country, for Mr. Sandberg says (p. 85): \"In the province of Tsang and in Sikkim, we have wudi or audi and pidi in use for 'this' and 'that.'\"\n\nI must call attention, in the paragraph on the plural number, to the omission of any reference to the use, as a plural sign, of the word ts'ang, meaning, originally, \"all,\" \"the whole.\" Thus, we hear ponbo-ts'ang \"the official,\" Sogbo-ts'ang \"the Mongols,\" and also na-ts'ang \"we,\" and k'o-rang ts'ang \"they.\"\n\nIn Chapter IV, on Adjectives, I think sufficient prominence is not given to the use of ha-chang in the formation of superlatives\u2014thus, ha-chang ch'enbo \"the biggest, or very\nbig\u201d\u2014and to the usual method of making intensive forms by the repetition of the adjective itself, as t'o-bo t'o-bo \"very high,\" ya-bo ya-bo \"very good,\" ch'ung ch'ung \"very small,\" nyung-nyung \"very little.\" The Chinese in like manner say hsiao-hsiao-ti \"very little,\" kuai-kuai \"very fast,\" etc. I may also call attention here to the colloquial mode of expressing \"the best,\" which is angi dang-bo, literally \"the number one,\" \"the first,\" exactly reproducing the Chinese expression t'ou i-ko (\u982d\u4e00\u500b); \"the worst\" is t'a-ma, literally \"the last,\" while \"very bad\" would be commonly expressed by ha-chang nan-ba. So the phrase which Mr. Sandberg gives on p. 40, mi dhe khang-pa ang-ki dhang-po la do gi yo, may mean, as he translates it, \"that man lives in the first house,\" but I should understand it to mean, \"that man has a first-class house.\"\n\nChapter V deals with Numerals. I think Mr. Jaeschke's treatment of the subject is more correct than that of our author. I have never heard cardinal numbers expressed in any other way than in that in which the former writer gives them. Thus, it is the more general practice, wherever I have been, and also, apparently, wherever Jaeschke has lived in Tibet, to say, for example, sum-chu tea nyi \"thirty-two,\" dzi-chu dz\u00e9 drug \"forty-six,\" drug-chu r\u00e9 na \"sixty-five,\" jya-t'am-ba \"one hundred,\" ton-tra-nyis jya-dun dang dun-chu don-jy\u00e4d \"two thousand seven hundred and seventy-eight,\" etc. Bum-tra (p'rag) is the colloquial expression for \"100,000.\"\n\nA very common mode of expressing \"twice,\" \"thrice,\" etc., is by prefixing the word ts'er \"time\" to cardinal numbers; thus, ts'er-nyis \"twice,\" ts'er-sum \"thrice.\" The expression ts'er-nyis, ts'er-sum means also, I may remark, \"repeatedly,\" and in Chinese we find the same expression, tsai san tsai ss\u00fc (\u518d\u4e09\u518d\u56db).\n\nChapter VI deals with the Verb. It is full and very comprehensive, and I have very little to add on the subject. Mr. Sandberg correctly points out the importance of the auxiliary verb r\u00e9-pa; the fact is, it is used infinitely more frequently in all parts of Tibet than any of the other\nauxiliary verbs, and in many of the phrases given by him, in which he uses yin, y\u00f6d, or dug, I think one would much more frequently hear natives use r\u00e9. Thus, \"I am a Tibetan\" is generally expressed by Beuba r\u00e9. \"This is nice\" is shimbo r\u00e9. The auxiliary y\u00f6d is very generally used with the dative with the sense of \"to have\"; thus, na-la y\u00f6d \"I have,\" literally \"to me is.\"\n\nThe interrogative \"is there?\" is more usually expressed by a (or \u00e9) y\u00f6d or a r\u00e9 than by any other form I know of. Thus, one will generally hear for \"are there any books in the lamasery?\" gomba-na p\u00e9-ch'a a y\u00f6d? \"Is the pass high?\" la t'o-bo a r\u00e9? etc.\n\nThe past tense is usually rendered by song, and in such other ways as Mr. Sandberg points out, but also very frequently the only indication of the tense is some adverb, conjunction, or verb; a method, by the way, the Chinese have also frequent recourse to.\n\nThe future tense of all the auxiliaries is very generally formed by the word gyu placed after the verb y\u00f6d; thus, \"shall you have milk to-morrow?\" is kyorang sanyin wo-ma y\u00f6d-gyu a r\u00e9, or y\u00f6d-gyu r\u00e9 yod-gyu ma r\u00e9? I have often heard this root used alone with an adjective, as, for example, d\u00e4ring ts'a-gyu r\u00e9 \"it will be hot to-day,\" and even drang-gyu-r\u00e9 \"it is getting cold,\" just as they say ts'a-yi-r\u00e9 \"it is hot,\" and drang-gi r\u00e9 \"it is cold\" (compare with this the Chinese expression l\u00eang-t\u00e9 h\u00e9n \u51b7\u5f97\u72e0 \"it is very cold\"); but these forms cannot be considered grammatical, though they certainly belong to the lingua franca of Mr. Sandberg, and should therefore be mentioned.\n\nIn the section relating to the active verb, I may add a reference to the frequent use, to express the completion of an action, of the word ts'ar with song; thus, \"he has finished his meal\" is za-ma za ts'ar-song; \"I have finished reading the book\" (na) pe-ch'a ta ts'ar-song. This has not been noted by Mr. Sandberg, who only refers (pp. 53, 54) to some other uses of this word.\n\nMr. Sandberg's remarks in this chapter on the construction of the Tibetan phrase, and also his Chapter XIII on\ncomposition, cannot be too carefully studied. Until one has got well into one's head the absolute necessity of dividing every phrase into short clauses, mostly gerundial, connected by some conjunction, adverb, or \"continuative particle,\" as the author aptly calls them (p. 121), one cannot hope to speak this language, or, for that matter, Chinese and many other Oriental ones I might mention. Mr. Sandberg (p. 121) truly says: \"The whole style of composition is a chain of gerundial and participial clauses, depending only technically upon one another. The chain of clauses or sentences proceeds continuously, each successive clause in form, though not in sense, a sequence from the other, until at length a final verb\u2014by no means the most important or main one in meaning\u2014brings a break in the connection.\"\n\nOne more observation on this part of the work and I have finished. On p. 69 Mr. Sandberg calls attention to \"a curious expletive, sounded o-go, often added to interrogative sentences, chiefly negative ones . . . and which may be said to answer to our 'won't you,' 'will you' at the end of any hortative injunction.\" I think that the author has misunderstood the exact value of this term, which means \"do you understand?\" A very common phrase, one that a foreigner is apt to hear very frequently, is ago, am\u00e9 go? \"do you understand or not?\" or else a go, with the same meaning.\n\nPassing to the subject of the formation of substantives, it is proper to note the curious use to which the word sa is put in forming a certain class of words. Thus, we hear lug-sa \"the place or object in which to pour out [a liquid]\"; den-sa \"the place one occupies or where one lives\"; and also dro-sa \"there is need for going,\" bab-sa mindo \"there is no probability of it [snow] falling,\" dro-sa mindo \"there is no need for going,\" etc.\n\nThe second part of Mr. Sandberg's work is devoted to conversational exercises and technical terms, which he prefaces with some useful remarks on pronunciation, some of them happily modifying the rules he previously laid\ndown in the first pages of his book. These rules tend to show that my \"execrable\" phonetic system of transcribing Tibetan really does give the sounds as heard in Lh'asa, though possibly not always those of the most highly educated; but then we are dealing with a lingua franea. I still persist in believing, after carefully studying this part of Mr. Sandberg's work, that for the purpose he had in view in writing this book\u2014which was to supply travellers with a phrase-book and a considerable amount of handy technical information\u2014it would have been better had he adopted a purely phonetic system of transcription. A traveller visiting a country, the first elements of whose language he does not understand, does not want, when consulting a phrase-book, to put some question to a native, to have to devote a half-hour's study to rules of pronunciation. Let the author of the book he is using tell him that in all native words transcribed vowels are pronounced as in French or Italian, and that consonants have the same value as in English, and let him further use no diacritical or other marks, and then the traveller will be able to pronounce his words in a manner, perhaps not perfectly satisfactory to a highly educated native, but sufficiently well to make his meaning understood. This is, perhaps, not a scientific method, but I think it is a practical one, and that is what one wants in works of this nature. The rules for the orthography of geographical names, printed in \"Hints to Travellers,\" published by the Royal Geographical Society (7th edition, pp. 38-43), meet with my hearty approval, and I see no reason why they should not be extended to a whole language as well as to geographical names, and to this work I would refer my readers for fuller information on the subject.\n\nThe conversational exercises give a number of useful phrases such as a traveller would wish to know to enable him to talk on that most interesting of all topics\u2014the weather, as well as about preparing and eating food, shopping, etc. There is in this part of the work much valuable information on paying and receiving visits, on\narticles of food, methods of reckoning time, the plants, trees, fauna, avi-fauna, monies, weights and measures, titles, religious edifices and usages, etc., of Tibet.\n\nIn connection with the section dealing with monies, weights and measures, I should remark that it is the usual\u2014I might say, as far as my observation goes, the universal\u2014rule when counting to put the word *gang* after the weight or measure when only one unit is referred to, and the word *do* \u201ca pair\u201d when there are two. Thus one renders \u201cone tael, two mace, and seven candareens\u201d by *sang-gang dzo-do karma dun*, not *sang chig dzo nyis dang karma dun*; and \u201ctwo fathoms and a span\u201d is *dambo-do t'o-gang*. This rule has been overlooked by Mr. Sandberg.\n\nThe third part of Mr. Sandberg\u2019s book is a vocabulary of useful words in Ladaki, Central, and literary Tibetan. I have only space to note the use he makes in it of the term *Kon-ch'og (dkon-mch'og)* to render \u201cGod.\u201d This term is used to express the Sanskrit *ratna* \u201cjewel,\u201d \u201ctreasure,\u201d especially in the expression *tri-ratna* (*i.e.* Buddha, Dharma, Sangha), and I think it a pity that Protestant missionaries have chosen it to express our word God. The Catholics have not, however, made a better selection, for they use the expression *Nam-k'\u00e4 Jo-wo* \u201cLord of Heaven\u2014of the sky,\u201d which is open to serious objection, though Tibetans say, it is true, *Nam-la chyag-dj\u00e4 (p'yag mdjad)* \u201cto pray to Heaven\u201d (in Chinese *pai T'ien \u62dc\u5929*).\n\nIn an appendix the author gives a few useful words and phrases in \u201cMongolized Tibetan as well as in the genuine Mongol language, the latter the colloquial idiom of the South.\u201d\n\nI do not exactly know what the author means by Mongolized Tibetan; it is about as vague a term as Anglicized French would be. It appears to me, judging from the presence in the vocabulary of such words as *atich* \u201clittle,\u201d *potso* \u201cboy,\u201d *chho* \u201clake,\u201d *homa* \u201cmilk,\u201d *sya* \u201ca bird,\u201d to be a mixture of some *t'u-hua* of Kan-su and of Koko-nor Tibetan. As to the Mongol, it approximates quite closely that spoken by the Halhas (Khalkhas) of Eastern and North-eastern Mongolia.\nA few typographical errors have escaped the author's eye. On p. 53 he writes *bok song* \"have dropped,\" \"fallen,\" instead of *bab-song*. On p. 184 he writes *Nam-ts'o chhyi-mo*, and on the next page *Nam-ts'o chhuk-mo*, both referring to the same lake, the Tengri-nor. On p. 187, speaking of the Tibetan legend on the silver tankas, the word before the last should be written \u0f62\u0f7c (abbreviated form of \u0f62\u0f7c\u0f0b). On p. 194 he has *roi-ma* (\u0f60\u0f7c\u0f51\u0f0b\u0f58) \"small brass cymbals in pairs\"; \u0f60\u0f51\u0f7c\u0f0b\u0f58 is impossible in Tibetan, as the letter \u0f60 cannot be prefixed to \u0f61. This instrument is more usually called *ding-sha*, and is the Indian *mandira* used to measure time in music.\n\nI must also call attention to the etymology of the word *Shap\u00e9*, a name given colloquially to the members of the Lh'asan Cabinet. This name, Mr. Sandberg says (p. 189), is *dzabs-pad* \"lotos-foot.\" This appears to me quite as fanciful as the derivation of the title Dzassak from *ja ts'ag* \"a tea sieve.\" Whether *Shap\u00e9* is really derived from *gshags* (pronounced *shag*) meaning \"justice,\" and *dp\u00e9* (pronounced *p\u00e9*) \"a model,\" or not, I do not feel competent to pronounce, but certainly this seems more rational than Mr. Sandberg's derivation of the word.\n\nFinally, the word *p'yil-ing*, which occurs repeatedly in this work, and is always translated by \"Englishman,\" means a \"foreigner of any nationality.\" It is *p'yil* \"outside,\" *gling* \"country,\" and appears to have been copied from the Chinese term for foreigner, *wai-kuo jen* (\u5916\u570b\u4eba) \"outside-country-man.\"\n\nAll the slight errors or omissions I have referred to in this work can easily be corrected in subsequent editions, and I have no doubt there will be many of them, for the book is very practical, and contains all that is necessary for the acquisition of a good knowledge of spoken Tibetan.\nIts advent should be hailed by all interested in the subject as a most valuable addition to our very scant knowledge of the subject it deals with.\n\nW. Woodville Rockhill\n\nPrimitive Civilizations, or Outlines of the History of Ownership in Archaic Communities. By Edith J. Simcox, author of \"Natural Law,\" etc. London: Swan Sonnenschein and Co. New York: Macmillan and Co.\n\nIn point of industry Miss Simcox's work is monumental. The extinct civilizations of Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia, and Phoenicia are laid before us in their every-day attire: the mummies, the winged bulls, temples, and merchant galleons all seem to have undergone a process of resurrection, and to move before us in a matter-of-fact manner just as if the ancients were part of our daily life, and going about their usual business. The second volume treats almost exclusively of China, whose present-day civilization differs only in detail from that of the hoary past. It is easy to see from the outset that the author has been somewhat fascinated with the idea that Chinese civilization is not by any means indigenous, at least in its earlier stages; and throughout the two volumes no opportunity is lost for comparing a celestial custom with the analogous practices in the Western empires of antiquity. But she protects herself against the consequences of too sanguine speculation on the part of such theorists as the late M. Terrien de Lacouperie by the following wise sentence, found at the end of Chapter iv, volume 2: \"At present this and other equally inviting lines of enquiry have not been followed up, on account of the difficulty of finding a scholar interested at once in the subject-matter of both classes of texts, and master enough of both archaic languages not to be misled by accidental or superficial resemblance.\"\n\nCivilization began with the discovery of writing. Although Miss Simcox can hardly be said to express herself\nanywhere in these bold terms, such is manifestly the deduction to be drawn from the extremely interesting theories she propounds touching the relation of sunlight, hieroglyphs, and sustained thought. One may even go farther, and ask why should not writing, in the primitive shape of shadows made permanent upon the rock, be more archaic even than articulate speech? The second part of the introduction treats of \"Prehistoric Problems,\" amongst which is the suggestion that we should account for the birth of letters and the common features of the distant monarchies of Egypt and China by tracing them to Turanians in Babylonia. The reasoning seems to be as follows, though Miss Simcox is certainly not responsible for the majority of the doubtful premises. There is absolute proof that the Egyptians and Babylonians resembled each other, in several important features, sufficiently to warrant the supposition of near relationship. It is unquestionable that Turanian inscriptions have been found in Mesopotamia. The distinguished traveller and geographer Von Richthofen (to whom, however, it must be noted, the Chinese literary authorities were only accessible second-hand), conceived the idea that the Chinese might have originally come from Khotan. \"Nations are not born in the plain.\" The Chinese would find easy descents to rich lands, if we assume them to have migrated from Khotan, along the Tarim River, to Lob Nor and the Hwang Ho. Both the Chinese and the Accadians (Chaldaeans of Turanian speech) described themselves as \"black-haired.\" True, we know the grounds upon which the Accadians by contrast chose to dub themselves \"black-haired,\" whereas we cannot account for the Chinese having done so;\u2014and so on. Whilst giving countenance to these reasonings, of which the late M. de Lacouperie was, in Europe at least, the chief apostle, Miss Simcox has been careful to safeguard her own repute in several pregnant passages, of which the following is one:\u2014\n\n\"When obscure points of history have to be elucidated, the Hebrew scholar knows at first sight all the light that can be thrown on them by the language and literature of that\npeople, and the same thing is true of the student of Egyptian and Chinese, and of the Assyriologists, all of whom necessarily attach more weight to the circumstantial evidence they possess in their own departments than to the comparatively isolated pieces of information which each may communicate to the other. In time, no doubt, the results of all separate lines of enquiry are thrown into the common fund, and all established facts assume their proper place and proportion.\" There is a certain degree of irony, too, in the qualification of M. de Lacouperie's evidence as consisting of \"varying degrees of conclusiveness.\" We are very much afraid that his evidence, taken as a whole, has never been seriously accorded any degree of conclusiveness by those students in the Chinese field who have justified, to the satisfaction of those in China as well as in Europe, their claim to be considered as sound authorities, however modest the degree of brilliancy each may possess in his own department. Miss Simcox concludes her introductory remarks as follows:\u2014\"Leaving all open questions of affinity to be decided by the learning of the future, we are certainly in a position to affirm that, before the so-called Aryans and Semites of history took the foremost place in the Old World, probably before they were clearly differentiated, the first civilized states in the world were founded by men of some other race, humane, industrious, non-political, but with a moral philosophy for the use of princes; liberal in the treatment of women, with the most unchanging customs of any people that have ever lived, and with the most enduring records of their life. By analogy we should expect all these states to belong to the same ethnological family; but, if the identification cannot be maintained, the similarity of temperament and institutions which suggested it only becomes the more noteworthy; as if the social order formulated by Chinese and Egyptian rulers were not merely one natural view, but in fact the first and only one that presents itself to a primitive community as either natural or possible.\"\n\nAs all men known to us have the same organs and limbs,\nand are therefore on equal ground with each other so far as touches their instinct for self-preservation, it follows that no one in the shape of a ruler could in primitive times have successfully asserted himself over his fellows except by the display of power, wisdom, or virtue, or all three combined, in such a commanding degree as to induce his less richly endowed fellows to place themselves under him and resign to him part of their free will. It is not only manifest, but it is historical for the past, and plain even for to-day, that the beginnings of states can always be traced to the pre-eminent powers, first of individuals, then of families or tribes. In other words, all primitive communities, with certain differences in detail, conceive and formulate that view of social order which is alone natural and possible.\n\nAs to the differences in detail, the differences between Babylonian, Chinese, and Egyptian social life are, after all, no greater than the differences between English, French, and German social life, and such differences will be accounted for in most cases by physical surroundings, the necessity of defence against natural or human enemies, and so on. It only stands to common reason that communities living near to each other are more likely to have originated in some common spot than communities living wide apart; it is also evident that proximate states are more likely to borrow ideas from each other than distant states. Men walk in the same way, eat in the same way, suffer and enjoy in the same way; yet one may turn the toes in or out, use fingers, knives, or chop-sticks; be drunkards or abstainers, wear trousers, clouts, or petticoats; punish certain acts as crimes, or extol them as virtues: yet still the world goes round as it always did, and men change very little. Perhaps it is not so wonderful after all that there is so much community of thought as it is that there is not more difference. The interesting discovery in our story-books for children that the cat is an animal of the tiger kind is no more wonderful than the explanation that the tiger is an animal of the cat kind. The moral of the whole thing seems to be that all human ways, interesting though they\nmay be, when newly described, to human beings, are, after all, very commonplace ways; but, like anything else subject to historical treatment and classification, they are apt to become a chaos unless subjected to the strictest scrutiny as to the causes and effects of their evolution. There is, perhaps, too much tendency now-a-days to assume certain classifications, as, for instance, that the Scythians of the Persians and Greeks were Aryans and not Turanians; that the Chinese are a later edition of Accadians; that the Babylonians were not Semites, and so on; straining the facts according to how we find them fit in with the pet theory. After all, Turanians are simply men who are \"not Iranians,\" and it is still doubtful exactly what Iranians were, and how far the word is co-extensive in its origin with Aria or Aryans. Semites, or descendants of Shem (even supposing the classification had any pretence to historical value), are, by the hypothesis, descendants from the father of Shem, who was also the father of Ham and Japhet. The nose may be a little longer or shorter, the hair and the skin lighter or darker, (distinctions common to all other animals), but our eyes, noses, ears, and limbs are all exactly the same in effect. The truest course is rather to postpone all attempts at classification until the materials are complete. It is only within a generation or two that we have been able even to decipher the Egyptian, Assyrian, and Babylonian writings, let alone to be quite sure of their meaning, not to speak of fixing and classifying modes of life, taxation, and social thought out of those meanings. So, also, with our knowledge of Chinese literature: it is young: the more we learn of it the plainer it is that the earlier work requires revision. To take Pauthier, from whom Miss Simeon frequently quotes, as an instance. No more intelligent or industrious man ever lived; but it is no exaggeration to say that, though his translations are as often right as wrong, they are as often wrong as right, and like some of the Chinese high roads, indicate to us rather what stumbling-blocks to avoid, and what general direction we must take, than offer to us a route along which we may safely travel.\nThere is not the faintest evidence that the Chinese ever came from Khotan, nor do the remarks of Ritter and Richthofen seem to justify such a supposition. There is not the faintest ground for connecting the \"Bak tribes\" of M. de Lacouperie with Bactria; the very word \"tribes,\" as a forced translation of sing, is a misnomer and an anachronism, and even the word bak (meaning \"a hundred\" or \"all, many,\" etc.) is tortured out of its natural form pak to fit in with this crude speculation. Though there are many instances where the Chinese idea of status, vendors' rights, land-tax, ancestors' ghosts, etc., seem to be similar to the corresponding ideas of Egypt, Babylonia, or Malabar, still there are just as many instances where they are diametrically opposed. Moreover, in taking the statements of translators second-hand as a basis for comparison, one is apt to start off with a false premise. For instance, the Chinese \"tien or 'contract'\" (vol. i, p. 184) is not a contract. Whatever it originally meant it never meant that, and in commercial affairs it absolutely means nothing now but \"a pledge,\" \"to pawn, or mortgage.\" Its other meanings, apart from trade, are \"solemn act,\" \"solemn formality,\" \"statute\": the very idea of \"contract\" (as shown by Sir Henry Maine) was very late in germinating in the oriental mind (i.e. Chinese or Indian). Then, again (p. 197), \"As in China, corn and silver were used as the chief medium of exchange.\" Cloth and silver certainly were; and, even if rice ever was thus used, (and it is the first time we have heard it, if so), rice is not corn. Rice in China was one of the chief taxes in kind: official salaries were often paid in rice, but that does not make it a medium of exchange. On page 218 we are told that \"in Egypt, as well as in China, property is transmitted almost entirely apart from marriage,\" a proposition as vague as it is unsatisfactory.\n\nOn the other hand, there are many instances passed over where an obvious connection with Chinese ideas might have been fairly surmised (in the absence of evidence either way); as, for instance (p. 249), \"reducing the town of\nan enemy to the condition of a ploughed field,\u201d which is to this day both a Chinese ideal and a Chinese literary expression; the system of identification by finger-prints (p. 378); the fact that in ancient Egypt (p. 94) \u201cagriculture counted for more than manufactures, and manufactures were of more importance than commerce\u201d; the fact that in ancient China, as with the nomad tribes bordering on China, descent was traced through the mother, as we are told (p. 123) was the case in Egypt. It is evident that all primitive tribes must have first conceived relationship through mothers, as there was no ocular or scientific evidence to connect a child with any father at all, still less with any specific father.\n\nThe fact is, Miss Simcox gives us in one purview what perhaps we have never had presented to us before, a very passable set of reduced pictures (taken in each case from originals, the identity of which the authoress herself had no means of checking), exhibiting the every-day life of Egyptians, Chinese, Accadians, and Babylonians. Miss Simcox accepts it as proven that \u201cthe highly developed commercial system of Babylonia was originated by the race which spoke a language that is now left to Tatars and Finns.\u201d The more complete and faithful are the pictures we get from original sources, the more opportunity we shall have in due course for rationally entertaining ourselves with problems as to the common origin of the peoples portrayed; but it must not be forgotten that peoples often adopt a new language: for instance, the Finnish Bulgarians have adopted Slav; the Tungusic Manchus have adopted Chinese; the Parthians (it seems doubtful whether they were Aryans or Turanians) were in their earlier civilization largely infected with Greek. But it is hardly yet time to speak of \u201cthat movement which brought the ancestors of Egyptians, Accadians, and Chinese from another highland cradle.\u201d We must first have plenty of leisure to sift our evidence. With regard to Assyrian, Egyptian, and Babylonian scholarship, the languages and literature are dead; the workers are all in London, Paris, or Berlin. But\nthe Chinese language and literature are not dead; it must not be forgotten that the chief workers are out in China, though the most influential audience may be in Europe. The workers in China must be reckoned with sooner or later, even if they be ignored now, and up to now there is much in the theory-making of home workers which they do not see their way to accept.\n\nIt is well known to students of Chinese literature that, when the first Chinese envoy crossed Parthia and reached the Persian Gulf or Syrian ports (it is uncertain which), the Parthian traders, i.e. the Arabs or Phoenicians of either Charax or Tyre, endeavoured to dissuade the envoy, or rather the envoy's lieutenant, from braving the dangers of the sea. This fact is obviously connected with the \"Phoenician lies\" about the dangers of the \"Tyrian seas,\" with which, Miss Simcox tells us on page 397, the navigators of other nations were alarmed. At this time the King of Parthia was assisting Vespasian against Vitellius, the Chinese were driving the Scythians farther west, and both Chinese and Western accounts agree that the Y\u00fcechi or Hephthals, subsequently called Yeptha by the Chinese, were invading Bactria. But everything in the Chinese records tends to show that the whole country was a completely new revelation; there is not the faintest tradition that the Chinese ever saw Khotan, or even heard of it, until they prosaically found their way there whilst groping for the Y\u00fcechi in quite historical times; still less is there reason to suppose they had ever heard of Transoxiana or Mesopotamia. Even the Hiung-nu, or Chinese Scythians, destitute of writing as they were, had not only traditions, but actually and historically described relations with the West as far as Urgenj, which is mentioned in Chinese history 2,000 years ago under the name Ukken. The farthest Chinese traditions show that relations had only been held by or rather forced upon the Chinese with the Scythians of the Yellow River; even the mythical journeys of the semi-historical King Muh do not take us beyond the sources of the Yellow River, and he was, admittedly, wandering in strange lands. No\nstraining will connect the solitary links at each end of Asia which are supposed to form a chain to join Akkad with China. In describing the (supposed) Ph\u0153nician habit of desolating the country around their isolated factories, Miss Simcox, ever on the look out for an extra link, adds the comment (p. 397) \"by a calculation like that which led the Chinese Emperors to protect their coasts from pirates by similar devastations.\" The Ph\u0153nicians are only supposed to have occasionally done it. No Chinese Emperor ever did it.\n\nA Manchu Emperor, a few years after the Chinese Empire was roughly conquered, did it for a year or two, and at once found out his mistake: but then the Manchus had never seen the sea before; not one Manchu seaman existed, (or, indeed, exists to this day); and uncouth early Manchu ideas in no way represent ancient China. This is only one illustration out of many. There can be no object in even hinting at a community of ideas between China and the West unless it be to create or increase the confused impression upon the credulous reader's mind that, though single links may be weak, the whole chain is notwithstanding there, either in substance or in shadow; in this particular case there is no justification for even imagining the possibility of a shadow.\n\nOn page 439 it is proposed that the elongated heads of Asia Minor suggest a descent from the Macrocephali of the Greeks. Here, supposing that we followed Miss Simcox's cue, we might state that, as now in Asia Minor, so in Manchuria, the elongating of the head by artificial pressure is a living custom; but even the Manchu Emperor Kienlung, in explaining the grounds of this custom in an imperial decree, protested against the habit of making too much of a popular practice for sensational purposes. So with \"the Chinese and Syrian rule against purchases or presents being made or accepted by persons in authority.\" Is it not an exception for any country not to have such a regulation? Is it not a fact that in China the rule is but the shadowy protest of conventional morality against the universal practice the other way? A Russian rule forbidding\ndrunkenness, or a French rule against licentiousness, would have as much value from a comparative historical point of view. Indeed, the Chinese are such an elastic people, and will stretch so far, that we are told on page 541 Sir John Barrow was struck by the physical resemblance between them and the Hottentots!\n\nTo sum up, therefore, the impressions created by the first volume: it is an admirably arranged popular account of Egyptian, Babylonian, Assyrian, and Phoenician civilization, in which the prominent social characteristics of each are compared in a most interesting and suggestive way. The writer of the present lines, whose speciality is Chinese, is quite incompetent to question the accuracy of individual statements so far as they touch the four Western civilizations; but he notices throughout that authorities upon facts affecting the Chinese have been too readily accepted by the authoress without that discrimination which one would naturally have expected from one who had consulted the original Chinese first-hand. This fact leads us to ask ourselves: Is it not possible that the acceptance of authority for the Egyptian and Mesopotamian facts may have been equally facile? Perhaps not; but, as the Chinese philosopher puts it, \"see one angle and a good joiner can calculate the other three.\" Any way, we cannot at all accept the theory that the Chinese are simply Turanian Mesopotamians in disguise, nor do we quite understand why so little is said of the ancient Indian civilizations; and India is certainly more accessible to Khotan and Turkestan than China. We are disposed, from our humble standpoint of limited knowledge, to accord to the authoress the highest praise for industry, acuteness, method, and judgment; as regards indiscriminateness, it is difficult to blame her, for how is she to know? When each sinologist poses as a prophet, how is she to recognize the true seer? All we can venture upon in the way of adverse criticism is to say that we regret the position into which she has been forced, whilst we fully recognize her caution and her intelligence in eying askance all possible pitfalls.\n\nJ.R.A.S. 1895.\nThe second volume gives us a very compendious and, on the whole, accurate history of the Chinese social development; perhaps the best, in this particular line, yet published in any European tongue. If this general judgment is supported by every other critic, Miss Simcox may well be content to accept a few specific corrections in detail. As is almost unavoidably the case in all instances where authors accept statements of fact second-hand, numerous misprints and mistranslations occur, as, for instance, Jo-shin for Jo-shui (p. 12); Khin for ts'in (p. 63); Ts'in for Tsin (pp. 124-28, etc.); Chua-to for Hwa-t'o (p. 130); Kao-tsong for Kao-tsou (p. 132); Lin for Liu (p. 152); Chinese Han-lia for Khitan Hanlin (p. 172); Kwan for wan (p. 221); Tai-tsou Ming for Ming T'ai-tsou (pp. 237, etc.); 11,000 for 1,100 (p. 240); Tang-ja-wang for T'ang Jo-wang (p. 250); Ou-ni-tao-jin for Ou-ni-lao-jin (p. 257). Of course these are small matters, but their recurrence tends to perpetuate error and confuse the reader. Moreover, the promiscuous acceptance of French, English, and Russian romanizations of Chinese sounds makes it difficult sometimes to know of whom she is speaking. Thus Su Che (if the French form) is Su Shi, or Su Tung-po himself, and not his brother Su Tcheh (Anglic. Che). Then the \"Ho-chang\" of p. 277 are simply \"bonzes\" (Anglic. Ho-shang). The Grand Canal (p. 224) was not the work of Kublai Khan, who did little more than repair and alter the course of an artificial watercourse already existing for many centuries. An admirable pamphlet upon this subject has recently been published by the Jesuit Fathers of Shanghai, a whole set of whose works (published under the name of Vari\u00e9t\u00e9s) Miss Simcox should at once obtain at the cost of a few shillings.\n\nOn the whole, we are disposed to endorse, in a general sense, all that Miss Simcox says in her second volume, which, considering that she is often compelled to accept what translators and specialists tell her whether she likes it or no, is certainly a marvellously successful piece of patchwork history. It is amusing, however, to find the\nChinese \"General\" Tcheng-ki-tong cited amongst the literary authorities.\n\nE. H. Parker.\n\nColonel Sir Robert Sandeman: His Life and Work on our Indian Frontier. By T. H. Thornton, C.S.I., D.C.L. 8vo. London, 1895.\n\nThe remarkable career of Sir Robert Sandeman, although little noticed outside India, was well worthy of permanent record; and it would be hard to find anyone better equipped for the task than Dr. Thornton, both by his sympathy with Sandeman's aims and his intimate knowledge of the facts. Naturally the author's former official position leads him to deal with the subject of the memoir more as a public man than as a private individual. The Bob Sandeman that we have heard his early intimates talk of, disappears nearly entirely in Sir Robert Sandeman, the Governor General's Agent for Baluchistan. But all things considered, this may be looked upon more as a merit than a defect. As an individual, Sandeman seems to have been just a bluff, burly, hearty Englishman (or Scotchman, perhaps I ought to say) of a not uncommon type, men who make up in tenacity of purpose for the want of great intellectual power.\n\nBorn at Perth in 1835, Robert Sandeman reached India in 1856 as a cadet in the old Bengal Army; and, after a brief experience of soldiering during the Mutiny, he joined the Panjab Commission in May, 1859. He became Governor General's Agent in Baluchistan in 1876; and died at the post of duty on the 29th January, 1892, near Las Beyla in that province. Luckily for him, most of his early service was in the districts west of the Indus, a country where his peculiar qualities were not stamped out of him, as they would have been in places where ready compliance with legal formalities and silent submissiveness to authority are, for most men, the best outfit for a successful official career. With Sandeman's appointment, in May 1866, to the district of Dera Ghazi Khan came the turning-point in his career;\nan opening here presented itself, of which he was not slow to avail himself. One-third of the population of the district was of the same Baluch race as the tribes beyond its western border. Both within and without the district, the supremacy of the tribal chiefs had decayed, intertribal quarrels were endless, and the public peace was constantly disturbed. In addition, the men beyond the frontier were at loggerheads with the Khan of Kalat, who claimed suzerainty over them. Sandeman now conceived the policy of reviving the power and authority of the Baluch chiefs, in the hope of so using them as to put an end to all differences among the Baluch inhabitants of his district. In this project he succeeded most marvellously, by a judicious mixture of firmness with conciliation.\n\nSince the same tribes held the land on both sides of the frontier, it was natural for Sandeman to attempt a similar intervention in the affairs of the independent section of the tribe. The method adopted for adjusting disputes was that of panchayats, coupled with a system of finding paid employment for tribal levies in keeping the country peaceful and the trade routes open. In these earlier measures we have the germ of that system of modified control and interference with which Sir Robert Sandeman's name is now so honourably connected. For nine years, 1866-75, Sandeman continued in charge of the Dera Ghazi Khan district, every year developing more fully his ideas of tribal management. At length, in 1875, came his opportunity of playing a greater part upon a wider stage; and for the remaining seventeen years of his life all his energies were devoted to carrying out on a larger scale the plans first conceived and put into force at Dera Ghazi Khan.\n\nSandeman's connection from this time with the affairs of Kalat brings us to his controversy with the officers in charge of the Sind border. The Sind system consisted in two things: (1) strict military patrol of, with non-intervention beyond, the border; (2) treatment of the Khan of Kalat as a sovereign prince, coupled with the complete denial of all political rights to the chiefs.\nsubordinate to him, who when they raised any difficulties were styled \"rebellious subjects.\" On this question, as we look back now, it is possible to believe that both the contending parties had some right on their side. Fifty years ago, when the Sind frontier system was organized, it would have been utter rashness to act on Sandeman's views. Bugtis, Marris, and Bozdars were then names of terror; our only hope, to keep them at arm's length and preserve our own districts from their incursions. No wonder that Sir William Merewether, able man though he was, should have failed to see in 1876 that the system, under which he had grown grey, had become antiquated. If it was, as it now seems to us it was, inevitable that an advance of our influence westwards must take place, the Sind system of non-intervention and a close frontier was doomed to perish. Sandeman now appeared in the very nick of time, as the man of Providence, with a ready-prepared scheme, and a strong, resolute will to back it. Some change there must have been. Thus, the situation being such as it was, even if Sandeman's plan had not been there for acceptance, some other must have been devised to meet the change of circumstances. Naturally the man who had something definite to propose, and was ready to back his choice, at the risk of his reputation and future career, carried everything before him.\n\nLucky was it for us that Sandeman had his way in 1876; otherwise, it is difficult to see how we could have succeeded in the southern half of our field of operations during 1878-79: and after the Maiwand check, complete disaster would have overtaken us, our route to the front would have been cut in two, Candahar in all probability would have fallen, had not Sandeman been already firmly seated at Quetta and wielding paramount influence in the whole country from Chaman to Sibi.\n\nStudy of the excellent map provided by Dr. Thornton will show the immense change in our position, worked by the intervention in Baluchistan which began in 1876, and of which almost the whole credit must be assigned to Sir\nR. Sandeman. Our sphere of influence has been carried some 800 miles further to the west; we command the flank of any force marching on India via Kabul; we are within easy striking distance of Candahar. Nor are we so far from Hirat as to be altogether unable to influence its fate. Our railway terminus is only fifty-nine miles from Candahar. By exploration and enquiry we have found out that the country of Baluchistan is not such an absolutely dreary and unprofitable waste as we have been brought up in the belief of its being. The coast is inhospitable; the country arid: no effort of man would, I fear, be able much to improve it. Still, without being one of the more favoured spots of the earth's surface, Baluchistan is capable of becoming once more, as it was of old, the seat of a great trading route between India and the West. Some day the main line of railway between east and west will pass across it. This vision may be realized, perhaps, before the present generation has totally disappeared; and in all these marvellous changes, both past and yet to come, Sir R. Sandeman's preponderating share must never be forgotten. It is too early yet, no doubt, to pass a final judgment on the results of the position recently assumed by us in Baluchistan. But, thanks to the sturdy honesty of purpose and thorough self-devotion of one man, of whom Anglo-Indians may well be proud, we have acquired a frontier of commanding strength, such as few, if any, of us expected to see ours for many generations. Our only fear for the future is that the king may arise \"which knew not Joseph,\" that the lessons we ought to have learnt from the past will be ignored, and that in our childish over-haste for so-called progress, we shall soon overstep the wise bounds set by Sandeman, and succumbing to our craze for legality and leaden uniformity of administration, proceed to set aside the chiefs and Khans, and attempt to rule Baluchistan as if it were a part of Lower Bengal. When that time comes, Dr. Thornton's masterly statement of frontier history and management will be there to act as a warning against such errors and as a guide into the right way. His \"Colonel\nSir Robert Sandeman\u201d takes rank among the classic works on the history of our administration in India, and will continue to be for many a year the leading authority on the subject to which it relates. He is to be congratulated on the successful completion of a difficult task.\n\nSept. 13th, 1895. W. Irvine.\n\nThe T\u0101r\u012bkh-i Rash\u012bd\u012b of M\u012brz\u0101 Mu\u1e25ammad Haidar Dughl\u0101t, a History of the Moghuls of Central Asia. An English Version, Edited with Commentary, Notes, and a Map, by N. Elias. The Translation by E. Denison Ross.\n\nThis is a book of high importance and interest to all who concern themselves with the history of the Moghul Empire. The author, M\u012brz\u0101 Haidar, was B\u0101ber\u2019s cousin. As a contemporary of the greater part of the events which he describes, and moving on equal terms among the master spirits of the age, he had every opportunity for getting the best information at first-hand. Consequently \u201cthe minute details which the author gives of his own sufferings and of the sufferings of his nearest relations during the period that followed the ascendancy of Sheib\u0101n\u012b Kh\u0101n in M\u0101werannaher and Khor\u0101s\u0101n\u2014of their escapes, adventures, successes, and discomfitures\u2014let us more into the condition of the country and feelings of the inhabitants of these states and of K\u0101shghar at that crisis, than perhaps any other monument extant.\u201d Such is the verdict of William Erskine, who has himself translated a large portion of the work (Brit. Mus. Add. 26,612), and the same praise may be extended to whatever in the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i Rash\u012bd\u012b is based on M\u012brz\u0101 Haidar\u2019s personal knowledge or experience.\n\nThe introduction, by Mr. Elias, is full of interesting matter. It contains (1) an account of the author, with an estimate of the historical value of his work; (2) a summary of the Chaghatai Kh\u0101nate down to its division, i.e. the point where M\u012brz\u0101 Haidar\u2019s narrative begins, including a genealogical table of the House of Chaghatai; (3) a description\nof the land of the Moghuls; (4) an account of the various peoples by whom it was inhabited; (5) a delineation, geographical and historical, of Uighuristan; (6) a brief recital of the events which took place in the period immediately subsequent to the completion of the T\u0101r\u012bkh-i Rash\u012bd\u012b.\n\nAmong much that will attract the specialist alone, anyone may read and admire the section on the physical geography of Moghulist\u0101n, with its graphic sketches, telling of one who has seen, not merely copied. The dissertation, also, on the different meanings of Moghul, Turk, and Uighur calls for special notice. Mr. Elias makes a valiant effort to clear up the confusion which has reigned so long over the geography and ethnography of this enormous area, and which, as he remarks, is mainly due to the shifting and haphazard nomenclature adopted by Oriental historians. Some of his conclusions may appear insufficiently supported, but in any case we must confess that he has thrown light into the darkest corners. A word is due in praise of the map, which will be of great assistance to those who would unravel the complicated movements of the time.\n\nThe translation, stripped for the most part of ornamental verses, moral sentiments, lists of pious and learned contemporaries, small-talk, miscellaneous anecdotes\u2014all that is unnecessary and therefore abundant in a Persian history\u2014is very readable and accurate, so far as can be judged in the absence of the original text. Much thought and patient labour have evidently been bestowed upon it. Here and there we meet with a doubtful rendering, e.g. h\u0101w\u016bd \u2018mention\u2019 (p. 95), where the ordinary meaning seems to make good sense; \u016b kh\u016bk murd \u2018that pig died\u2019 (p. 90); kh\u0101s Moghul \u2018a thorough Moghul\u2019 (p. 179), for which, though it has Erskine\u2019s authority, I should prefer to read h\u0101mi-yi Moghul \u2018guardian of their interests.\u2019 The chronogram on p. 95, sar-i khar giriftah Abdul Kudus, requires elucidation. As it was composed to commemorate the exchange by Abdul Kudus of an urban for a pastoral life, khar must point to kharg\u0101h, and we may render: \u2018Abdul Kudus took a fancy to tents.\u2019 On p. 174 the words\n'became a falcon,' which Mr. Elias says he cannot explain, are derived from Sufistic sources. The falcon typifies the soul returning to God. So Jal\u0101ludd\u012bn R\u016bm\u012b writes in one of his poems\u2014\n\nBish'niadam az haw\u0101-i tu \u0101w\u0101z-i tabl-i b\u0101z;\nB\u0101z \u0101madam, kih s\u0101'id-i sult\u0101nam \u0101rz\u016bst.\n\n'For love of thee I hearkened to the sound of the falcon-drum;\nI returned [or I became a falcon], for the arm of the King is my desire.'\n\nThe spelling and accentuation of Oriental words is not all it should be. On p. 218 alone we find D\u0101hist\u0101n, Al\u0101mat, and H\u0101shishin. The author tells us that this part of the work was performed under difficulties, and practically the value of his book is not much impaired by a fault which the Persian scholar will easily correct, and others, of necessity, ignore.\n\nREYNOLD A. NICHOLSON.\n\nBIBLIOTHECA LINDESIANA. CATALOGUE OF CHINESE BOOKS AND MANUSCRIPTS. Privately printed. 1895.\n\nIn the introduction to this Catalogue, Mr. Edmond, the Librarian, tells us that the Chinese portion of the great Library at Haigh Hall contains about 8000 native volumes. The foundation of this collection, which was made by the late Lord Crawford, was the purchase en bloc of the Chinese library of M. P. L. van Alstein, in 1863. Many additions were afterwards made through agents in China, until the collection assumed its present dimensions.\n\nA catalogue of the Van Alstein Collection was made by J. Williams, the author of a learned work on Chinese astronomy, and that formed the basis of the present Catalogue. This should be looked upon, the compiler tells us, \"as a brief hand-list or preparatory study, rather than a catalogue worthy of the importance of the collection.\"\nAs it stands, however, the Catalogue is a creditable production, and forms a good index to the books in the Chinese portion of the library. The compiler acted wisely in taking advice from Professor Douglas and in following the Wade system of transcription of Chinese sounds.\n\nFrom this Catalogue we learn that the collection of Chinese books in the Bibliotheca Lindesiana is one fairly representative. We find it contains a large number of works by the early Jesuit and Protestant Missionaries, good editions of the Confucian classics, some valuable Buddhist and Taoist books, the best historical treatises, some good encyclopaedias and collections of reprints, several valuable philological treatises, and not a few of the higher works of light literature. It contains also several treatises in Manchoo and Corean, and a few works on Chinese subjects written in Western languages.\n\nAs the present Catalogue is apparently intended to be only the outline of a fuller one to be made hereafter, it may be of service to point out some of the points in which corrections and improvements may be made.\n\nIn No. 260, page 3, it would be more correct to call Ch'ang-an not the but an ancient capital of China. Several other cities have also been ancient capitals.\n\nIn No. 304, p. 10, and in other places it would be better to substitute Confucius for K'ung Ch'iu.\n\nUnder No. 259, p. 13, it should be stated that the \"Chu tz\u016d ch'\u00fcan shu\" is not a complete collection of the writings of Chu Hsi. There are several treatises by the great philosopher and commentator not included in this collected edition of his writings.\n\nPage 15, No. 195. \"Traditions of Tso. By Tso Ch'iu-ming.\" This is apparently not correct. The Chinese name indicates that the treatise which bears it is a reprint of an annotated edition of the \"Ch'un-ch'iu\" with Tso's commentary.\n\nUnder No. 203, p. 15, instead of \"Complete works of Lo Pi\" we should have \"Reprint of the Ch'ien-chi of Lu Shih.\"\nUnder No. 194, on the same page, the words \"Description of Ch'\u00fceh Li\" give an imperfect idea of the book bearing the title \"Ch'\u00fceh-li-chih.\" This book gives an account of Confucius' birthplace, tomb, temple, and of the worship performed in the temple, and of the places in the neighbourhood associated with the sage. In the Number Key the character for Kuan is given by mistake for that for Ch'\u00fceh.\n\nPage 18, No. 321. Fa-hsien's \"Fo-kuo-chi\" is not \"a narrative of the travels of Fa-hsien in Central Asia\" (where he went to obtain information and documents regarding the Buddhist religion). It describes briefly the pilgrim's journey overland to India, his travels in that country\u2014the one to which he went for \"information and documents about the Buddhist religion\"\u2014and it relates his voyage from India to Ceylon, and his return to China. The edition of the \"Fo-kuo-chi\" in Lord Crawford's Library is the comparatively rare one edited by Hs\u00fc Hs\u00fc, of Nan-ch'ang. In the Catalogue the name of the editor is given as \"Hs\u00fc Hs\u00fc-kuung,\" but the word kung here probably stands for the character so read which means \"respectfully,\" \"reverently,\" and belongs to the next character.\n\nPage 19, No. 64, for \"Amitatha\" read Amitabha or Amitayus, and in the name of the translator j should be substituted for g.\n\nNo. 322, p. 19. \"Fo Tsu Li Tai T'ung Tsai.\" This treatise is much more than a \"History of the Buddhist saints or patriarchs.\" It is rather the annals of Buddhism first in India and afterwards in China in connection with Chinese legends and history.\n\nPage 25, No. 445. For Hs\u00fc in \"Hs\u00fc-ting-ch'ien-l\u00fc, and in the Number Key for the same, Ch'in should be substituted.\n\nNo. 343, p. 28. The \"I ch'ieh ching yin i\" explains not only the \"foreign technical terms found in the Buddhist works,\" but also the difficult native words and phrases.\n\nNo 331, p. 36. The \"Li Sao\" was composed by Ch\u00fc Yuan, not by \"Feng Sao.\"\n\nNo. 362, p. 38. \"Liu shu ku.\" This book is not \"an ancient dictionary,\" but a philological treatise of the\nthirteenth century. It gives an account of Chinese characters under the sixfold classification of them according to their origin and use.\n\nNo. 335, p. 42. \"Mu T'ien tz\u00fc Ch'uan Chu pu Ch\u00eang.\" This title is explained as meaning \"Respectful terms for addressing the Emperor and superiors generally.\" The book, however, is apparently the well-known account of the Emperor Mu's visit to Hsi-Wang-Mu.\n\nThese and other errors of interpretation and transcription can be easily rectified. The compiler would make his Catalogue more useful by giving the number of the Chuan instead of the pen of the books, and by explaining whether a date added to a work is that of the particular copy or of the book when produced or first published.\n\nT. W.\n\nDie Religion des Veda. Von Hermann Oldenberg. pp. 620. Berlin, 1894.\n\nNot for many years has so important a work as this appeared in any department of Sanskrit research. It is a book which is full of ideas, dealing in a thoroughly scientific spirit with a vast amount of material, and while calling in question many accepted views, puts forward a number of new ones in their place. I have therefore felt it to be my duty to devote, through lack of other leisure, part of a summer holiday to writing an appreciation of the book, rather than that its appearance should pass without some record in the pages of this Journal.\n\nThe work consists of two parts of about equal length, the former treating of the mythology of the Veda, the latter of its cult. The objection might be made that it is too soon for a new treatment of the subject after the publication of Bergaigne's great work La Religion V\u00e9dique. But Bergaigne's book is limited in its scope to the hymns of the Rigveda, and bears the character of a thesaurus of materials. Oldenberg's\nwork, on the other hand, exploits not only the whole field of Vedic literature but also much else beyond its range, and subjects the material utilized to a philosophically critical treatment. The second part is particularly valuable as presenting, in a masterly fashion, a subject never before adequately treated as a whole. Few living Sanskritists would have been capable of thus sifting and concentrating so vast an amount of scattered material without smothering the general treatment under a mass of detail. The book, therefore, not only represents a great advance in itself but will doubtless also prove a stepping-stone to accelerated progress.\n\nI am unable to agree with several of the positions taken up by the author, and think that some of them, even though defended by a scholar of Prof. Oldenberg's grasp, are not likely to be accepted without a more minute examination of the material in question than seems possible in a work of so wide a scope. The probable rejection of some of them after such examination will, however, only lead to that advancement of truth which all real scholars have at heart.\n\nPerhaps the most important hypothesis put forward by Prof. Oldenberg is that the seven \u0100dityas, as representing the seven planets, of which Varu\u1e47a, the moon, was the chief, were borrowed in the Indo-Iranian period by the Aryans from a Semitic nation more skilled in astronomy than themselves. The arguments in favour of this hypothesis may briefly be reproduced thus: The group of the seven \u0100dityas corresponds to the Ameshaspentas of Avestan mythology. Mitra and Varu\u1e47a are the chief \u0100dityas. Mitra (=the Avestan Mithra) is admittedly the sun. Varu\u1e47a (=the Avestan Ahura Mazda) is, probably even in the oldest Vedic period, the moon. Finally, the identification of Varu\u1e47a with the Greek \u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 must be absolutely rejected. Now all these propositions, excepting Mitra and Varu\u1e47a being the chief \u0100dityas and Mitra originally the sun, are liable to be seriously called in question.\nMost scholars are now-a-days fully alive to the danger of mythological equations based on the identification of names, as only tending to force together conceptions which are totally disconnected. In the present case we have a phonetic equation which, though offering a slight difficulty, is not one of those which, like many other identifications of comparative mythologists, have to be rejected in the light of the stricter phonetic laws now recognized (cp. Brugmann, Grundriss, ii, p. 154). But we have not only the phonetic equation; we have also a fundamental equation of conceptions. For the oldest evidence we possess\u2014that of the Rigveda\u2014is certainly more in favour of Varuna being the encompassing sky than anything else (cp. J.R.A.S. 1894, p. 628). Oldenberg, it is true, thinks that the absence of Mitra's connection with day and Varuna's with night in the oldest Veda, does not disprove the age of that connection. Now the late occurrence of a myth absent in earlier literature, admittedly does not disprove the antiquity of that myth. But when we have one form of a myth in the Rigveda and another in the later Vedas, very strong arguments must surely be adduced to demonstrate that the Rigveda represents the more recent stage.\n\nThe identity of Mitra with the sun in the Indo-Iranian period, combined with the fact that Mitra and Varuna are dual chiefs of the \u0100dityas, by no means shows that Varuna was the moon. The improbability, moreover, of the moon, the lesser deity, so completely overshadowing the sun, would require a satisfactory explanation. The identification of the \u0100dityas with the seven Ameshaspentas, in which Oldenberg follows Roth (Z.D.M.G., vi, 69 sqq.), may be correct; but Spiegel doubts it, and Windischmann thought the Ameshaspentas a purely Iranian creation. The number seven can scarcely be said to be characteristic of the \u0100dityas. Not more than six are ever enumerated by name, and that only once (RV. II, 27, 1). Their number is only twice specified, and that in the younger parts of the Rigveda, once as seven, along with two other groups of seven only (IX, 114, 3), and once as eight (X, 72, 8). The number\nis given as eight in the Atharva-veda, the Taittiriya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, and the \u015aatapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, the latter also stating it to be twelve. The isolated application of the number seven may therefore quite well be purely Indian, due to the analogy of the seven R\u1e63is, the seven priests, the seven rays of the sun, and so forth. Again, though in the Veda the names of the three lesser \u0100dityas (Bhaga, Am\u015ba, Dak\u1e63a) are abstractions like those of the Amesha-spentas, there is no single correspondence in the names of these abstractions. Finally, Oldenberg has to assume that the character of the \u0100dityas, and particularly of Varu\u1e47a, could, when borrowed by the Aryans, hardly have been understood, it being impossible that the moon as such could within the Indo-Iranian period have developed so highly abstract and ethical a character as to account for the supreme position as a moral ruler of Ahura Mazda in the Avesta, and of Varu\u1e47a in the Veda. Thus Oldenberg\u2019s hypothesis appears to me to involve too many doubts, improbabilities, and assumptions to warrant its acceptance.\n\nAnother view of more general bearing put forward in this work, is the existence, among the deities of the earliest Vedic period, of a number of direct abstractions. On the general character of the Vedic pantheon, Oldenberg himself says it is certain that the higher gods [i.e. those which are not of a semi-divine or fetishistic nature] of the Vedic, and certainly also of the Indo-European period, are without exception, or well-nigh without exception, the deified representations of entities in nature or the forces which are active in the great phenomena of nature (p. 40).\n\nAll the deities of the Rigveda which admit of being regarded as abstractions may be divided into three classes. One of these, consisting of purely allegorical personifications of abstract qualities, such as Manyu (Wrath) and \u015araddh\u0101 (Faith), is scantily represented in the Rigveda, and that only in the very latest hymns, because of the speculative tendency which manifests itself in these. This class of deified abstractions, further developed in the V\u0101jasaneyi-Samhit\u0101 and the Atharva-veda, as exemplified by K\u0101ma (Desire), prevails\nstill more in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as and in post-Vedic mythology, with personifications like Dharma (Duty). With this group Oldenberg is not concerned.\n\nAnother class of abstractions which is also rare, and the deities of which, with one or two exceptions, are separate individuals in the tenth book only, comprises names with the value of attributes or epithets. Praj\u0101pati, Lord of Creatures, is an example of this type. In the only older portion of the Rigveda (IV, 53, 2) in which it occurs, this name is actually an epithet of Savitr, who is there called 'supporter of heaven and praj\u0101pati of the world.' In IX, 5, 9 it is applied as an epithet to Soma compared with Tva\u1e63\u1e6dr and Indra. In the remaining four occurrences, all in the tenth book, Praj\u0101pati appears as an independent deity, once as the supreme god above the other gods (X, 121, 10). It is only in the S\u016btras and the post-Vedic Brahmanical literature that he becomes identified with Brahm\u0101. One god belonging to this class, Brhaspati or Brahma\u1e47as pati, Lord of Prayer, occurs frequently in the oldest as well as the recent parts of the Rigveda. This is one of the deities Oldenberg appears to regard as a direct personification, 'the celestial embodiment of the priesthood' (p. 16, cp. 592). To me the evidence seems, though perhaps erroneously, to be in favour of Brhaspati having been originally an epithet representing the sacerdotal side of Agni's nature, which had already at the beginning of the Rigvedic period acquired an independent character. The many traits he has in common with Agni, especially that of purohita, domestic priest, besides his occasional identification with that god, would be accounted for by the original connection, while the much more frequent distinction made between him and Agni would be due to Brhaspati's acquired independence. It would, however, take too much space to set all this forth in detail.\n\nThe third class includes names expressing a particular sphere of activity and mostly having the form of a nomen agentis in -tr. It includes, if Oldenberg's view be correct, four gods as familiar to the oldest portions of the Rigveda as\nto the youngest. These are the 'Instigator' (Savitr), the 'Wanderer' (Vi\u1e63\u1e47u), the 'Fashioner' (Tva\u1e63\u1e6dr), the 'God of Roads' (P\u016b\u1e63an). We may take Dh\u0101\u1e6dr, the Ordainer or Creator, as a clear example of this type. The name sometimes occurs in the Rigveda as an appellative of priests as 'ordainers' of the sacrifice. As the name of a deity, it occurs about a dozen times, but only in the tenth book, with the single exception of one verse (3) in a hymn to the Vi\u015bvedev\u0101s, which enumerates a large number of deities (VII, 35). In one of these later passages (X, 167, 3) it occurs as an epithet of Indra, and in another (X, 82, 2), of Vi\u015bvakarman. The similarly formed name Tr\u0101\u1e6dr, protector, is mostly used as an epithet of Agni or Indra. It also occurs independently as deva tr\u0101\u1e6dr, the protector god, four times (IV, 55, 5. 7; I, 106, 7; X, 128, 7), besides one occurrence in the plural (VI, 50, 1). Roth expresses the opinion in the large St. Petersburg Dictionary that deva tr\u0101\u1e6dr has special reference to Savit\u1e5b and also to Bhaga. Thus of these two gods, Dh\u0101\u1e6dr and Tr\u0101\u1e6dr, it can, at any rate, hardly be maintained that they are old creations or direct abstractions. But the god Savit\u1e5b, whose name is clearly of pure Indian derivation, from the root su 'to impel,' and undoubtedly means the 'Inciter,' etc., is mentioned with much frequency in the oldest parts of the Rigveda. There may, therefore, be better grounds for supposing that this deity embodies directly the idea of stimulation. Against such a view it may be urged that Savit\u1e5b undeniably partakes very largely of the character of the sun. Though it is impossible here to show this in detail, some of the more striking statements to this effect may be mentioned. Savit\u1e5b is pre-eminently the golden deity. He illumines heaven and earth (I, 38, 7. 8; etc.). He raises aloft his strong golden arms, with which he blesses and arouses all beings (II, 38, 2, etc.). The raising of his arms is, in fact, characteristic (I, 95, 7). He moves with his chariot, seeing all creatures, on a downward and an upward path (I, 35, 2. 3). He shines after the path of the\ndawn (V, 81, 2). In several passages Savit\u1e5b and S\u016brya appear to be indiscriminately spoken of to denote the same deity. There are some traces that the word has not yet entirely lost its attributive value, for it is twice used as an epithet of Tva\u1e63\u1e6d\u1e5b (III, 55, 19; X, 10, 5), and in nearly half its occurrences accompanies the word deva. It is, therefore, certainly very probable that Savit\u1e5b, the Stimulator, should represent one of the sun\u2019s most prominent characteristics, its stimulating power, which both arouses animate beings to life in the morning, and promotes the vegetable growth of the earth. Though of a more special character than S\u016brya, he might be identified with the latter because of the original connection being still felt, but distinguished from the concrete sun as having gone through a separate evolution of his own. This seems decidedly more probable than that Savit\u1e5b should be a pure abstraction of the notion of stimulation\u2014which is contrary to the general tendency of the mythological creations of the Rigveda\u2014and should then have attracted to himself a large body of solar traits. And all the time the name expresses an entirely appropriate attribute of the sun as its starting-point. Oldenberg\u2019s view, in fact, seems unnecessarily to invert the probable order of evolution.\n\nHe further explains Vi\u1e63\u1e47u to be the \u2018Wanderer,\u2019 as exemplifying the notion of \u2018wideness of space.\u2019 He cannot see that this deity recognizably represents a power of nature, and thinks that every distinct trace of solar character is absent in him (p. 227 f.). The prevailing notion in the conception being wideness of space, Vi\u1e63\u1e47u is the god who traverses it, orders and procures it for men. His characteristic three steps cannot refer to the sun\u2019s course, for what is said about them does not agree with morning, noon, and evening, the third step being sublime and leading to the mysterious world of the highest height, and showing no connection with sunset. The triple nature of Vi\u1e63\u1e47u\u2019s strides Oldenberg therefore explains from the general favour shown to the number\nthree in mythology. Now it is quite true that if Vi\u1e63\u1e47u be a solar deity, his character has become greatly obscured. But I have endeavoured to show (J.R.A.S. 1895, pp. 170 ff.) that the evidence supplied by the Rigveda and the later literature is sufficient to warrant the inference that Vi\u1e63\u1e47u actually represents a solar deity conceived as the sun, not in his general character, but as the swiftly moving luminary which with vast strides traverses the whole universe in its threefold division of earth, air, and heaven, so familiar to Vedic cosmology. This explanation meets Oldenberg's objection to the usual interpretation of the three steps, while satisfactorily accounting for the character of the third step.\n\nSpace will not admit of my examining, even in the cursory method followed above, the arguments advanced by the author in favour of his theory as applied to the gods P\u016b\u1e63an and Tva\u1e63\u1e6dr. I must content myself with stating the opinion that, on the one hand Oldenberg's view is not conformable to the general cast of thought in the oldest Rigvedic period; while, on the other, there seem to be good grounds for a different explanation. We must hasten to consider some of the numerous other points which claim attention.\n\nOldenberg revives and approves of the hypothesis first advanced by Mannhardt, that the phenomenon represented by the A\u015bvins, the twin gods of early dawn, are the morning and the evening star. He certainly supports this view with great plausibility. The arguments in favour of the identification are these: The morning star is the only light beside the morning fire, the dawn, and the sun. The time of the A\u015bvins, their luminous nature, and their course around the heavens are applicable to the star. Not so their duality. For while the A\u015bvins are inseparable, the two stars are eternally apart. Still, the evening star would naturally be thought of as forming a couple with the morning star. Considering the importance of the morning in Vedic worship, and the fact that sunset plays practically no part in it, while the A\u015bvins nevertheless are in some passages invoked\nmorning and evening and are sometimes even spoken of as separate in the Rigveda, it seems by no means unintelligible that the star of evening should have come to be worshipped in association with that of morning. This view, Oldenberg shows, is further supported by the evidence of comparative mythology (p. 212, note 3). The A\u00e9vins, who are horsemen, sons of heaven, drive across the sky, and possess a sister, have a parallel in the famous horsemen of Greek mythology, the \u0394\u03b9\u1f78\u03c2 \u039a\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9, the brothers of Helena, and in the Lettic sons of god who come riding on their steeds to woo the daughter of the sun, either for themselves or the moon. In the latter myth, too, the morning star is said to have come to look at the daughter of the sun.\n\nAmong all the numerous explanations given by interpreters, who have been puzzled by the A\u00e9vins since the time of Y\u0101ska, the only one, perhaps, which might seem to compete in likelihood with the present theory, is that of Goldst\u00fccker, who thought that the A\u00e9vins represented the inseparable duality of light and darkness which constitutes the morning twilight.\n\nOldenberg may be right in adhering to the generally accepted opinion that Parjanya goes back to the Indo-European period, as being identical with the Lithuanian Perkunas. There are, however, some reasons worthy of consideration in favour of this god being a recent mythological creation. The conception of Parjanya in the Rigveda is naturalistically fresh, and the activity of the god is very realistically and literally described. The connection between the appellative meaning of rain-cloud and its personification is so close that it is often hard to say which is intended. The name of Parjanya is regularly coupled with the literal name of wind, v\u0101ta, while the more fully personified Indra is associated with the less concrete V\u0101yu. If Parjanya and Perkunas are the same, it seems likely that only the appellative meaning is Indo-European. But how can the equation Parjanya=Perkunas be justified phonetically?\n\nIn his interpretation of the Indra myth, Oldenberg\nappears to me to explain one point too literally and another too figuratively. He is of opinion that the release of the waters by Indra, was by the poets of the Rigveda understood not of celestial but of terrestrial waters set free from terrestrial mountains. The refutation of this view seems to follow from the author's own statements. According to his own conviction, comparative mythology proves that the cloud waters were originally meant, while the later mythology recognizes the atmospheric character of the Vrtra fight, and the Rigveda itself shows isolated remnants and traces of the old conception. Why the Rigvedic poets should have undergone this intermediate aberration, is hard to see. It is true that Indra is scarcely ever said in the Rigveda to rain. But is it not natural that the release of the celestial waters should be described in more or less stereotyped mythological terms, just as lightning is regularly called Indra's vajra, in order to differentiate his activity from the literally described operations of a cognate deity like Parjanya? It is no doubt also true that clouds, much the same as lightning, play no great part in the Rigveda (p. 141), as Oldenberg says in agreement with Hillebrandt. But it is surely only true of the literal names of those phenomena. It will not easily be admitted to be true mythologically. Such an argument would tell still more strongly against Hillebrandt's lunar theory of Soma. For the literal name of moon, m\u0101s or candram\u0101s, occurs decidedly less often in the Rigveda than that of lightning (eidyut) or of cloud (abhra, abhriya). On the other hand, there appears to be hardly sufficient reason for Oldenberg's metaphorical explanation of Indra's winning of light as 'the attainment of bright goods after overcoming terrible danger' (p. 151).\n\nAp\u0101m nap\u0101t, the Son of Waters, in Oldenberg's opinion, probably does not represent lightning in the Rigveda, but fire in all water, especially rivers and ponds. Opinion is almost unanimous that this deity represents a form of Agni in the Rigveda. Though Agni may have been regarded as latent in terrestrial waters, as being so often extinguished\nby them, it is hardly likely that in this condition ordinary fire should so often be spoken of as shining forth, to say nothing of shining with undimmed splendour in the highest place (II, 35, 14). He is, moreover, distinctly connected with lightning in the often quoted passage: 'clothed in lightning, the son of waters has mounted upright on the lap of the slanting (waters)' (II, 35, 9). The name itself is indicative of issuing from the waters. The Avesta has, however, to be reckoned with in determining this deity's original nature. Oldenberg, disagreeing with Darmesteter, who identifies Ap\u0101m nap\u0101t with fire in the story of the conflict of \u0100tar (fire) and the dragon (Yasht XIX), takes him to have been originally a genius of the waters. The rather scanty and indefinite information about him quoted from the Avesta (p. 118) seems to favour the Rigvedic conception quite as much as Oldenberg's view. The only support for his opinion which he can adduce from the Rigveda is the fact that RV. X, 30, a hymn addressed to Ap\u0101m nap\u0101t, is in its ritual application exclusively concerned with ceremonies connected with water and not with fire. But this hymn is by no means so decidedly sacred to Ap\u0101m nap\u0101t. According to the Anukrama\u1e47i it is addressed to 'the waters or Ap\u0101m nap\u0101t.' As the name occurs only three times in its fifteen verses, Ludwig and Grassmann agree in regarding the hymn as celebrating the waters only, which are mentioned in every verse. 'Son of waters' is a graphic designation of lightning, while some such expression as 'lord of waters' would better describe a genius of the waters.\n\nOldenberg, dissenting from the view that Rudra is a storm-god, believes him to be a demon of disease coming from forest and mountain, like Mars Silvanus. It is, however, hard to get over the fact that he is the father of the Maruts, who are often called Rudras. They would hardly be so named if their father were so totally different in character from themselves. His being characteristically an archer is liable to more than one interpretation; but his missiles are several times definitely referred to. He is\nspoken of as holding a bolt in his hand (vajrab\u0101hu), an epithet applied to no other god but Indra. His lightning shaft discharged from the sky traverses the earth (VII, 46, 3). He is besought not to assail his worshippers with celestial fire, but to cause lightning to descend elsewhere (AV. XI, 2, 26; X, 1, 23). He is the ruddy boar of heaven (I, 114, 5), the term boar being otherwise mythologically applied to the Maruts and to V\u1e5btra. The three hymns addressed to Rudra in the Rigveda consist chiefly of deprecations, in which he is besought to spare his worshippers and their cattle with his bolt. His name in some passages of the Rigveda appears to be an epithet of Agni. Though it cannot be said that there is anything very definite to show clearly what natural substrate he represents, a probable conclusion may be drawn from the above-mentioned traits. The relation of Rudra to mountains and forests is not found till the later Vedic literature, and its force as an argument is weakened by his there being connected with all kinds of localities. The evidence of the Rigveda would, therefore, appear to be in favour of Rudra being a storm-god, in whom the baleful nature of lightning is prominent, in contrast with its action wholly beneficial to man in the case of Indra. This accounts for his formidable nature\u2014which is more and more developed in the later literature\u2014manifested in his killing and injuring man and beast with his shafts. It also accounts for his being the father of the storm-gods. The healing and beneficent side of his character would be due partly to the purifying action of the thunderstorm in clearing away hurtful miasmas, and partly to his action of sparing those whom he might slay. The latter trait doubtless gave rise to the euphemistic attribute \u2018auspicious\u2019 (\u015aiva), which developed into his regular name in post-Vedic mythology.\n\nOur author criticizes adversely (p. 101) the much discussed theory of Henotheism, \u2018the belief in individual gods alternately regarded as the highest,\u2019 a theory which has also been opposed by Whitney and Hopkins. Oldenberg argues that, on the one hand, hymns addressed to the\nVi\u015bvedev\u0101s are frequent, in which all the deities, even the lesser ones, are praised in succession; while, on the other, the technical priest could not but know the exact relative position of each god in the Soma ritual, for which the great mass of the Vedic hymns were composed, and which included the worship of almost the entire pantheon. He concludes, therefore, that Henotheism is rather an appearance than a reality, an appearance produced partly by the indefiniteness of outline in the Vedic gods, and partly by the natural exaggeration of the priest and singer in extolling the attributes of the god he is addressing. This piece of criticism seems decidedly to hit the nail on the head.\n\nIn his appendix (pp. 599\u2013612) Oldenberg\u2019s destructive criticism treats with telling effect the novel hypothesis advanced by Hillebrandt in his important book *Vedische Mythologie*, that Soma as a god throughout the Rigveda means the moon, which, moreover, is the centre of Vedic worship. The late Prof. Whitney, in a paper touching upon this hypothesis in a sceptical spirit, had called for a detailed examination. This Prof. Oldenberg has, without delay, supplied in a masterly fashion. His argument is in outline as follows: In the vast majority of references to Soma in the Rigveda, the character of the god as a personification of the plant and juice is clear and obvious. On the other hand, while the identification of Soma and the moon is unmistakable in the later literature, there is in the whole of the Rigveda no single instance either of an express identification or of an express reference to the moon being the food of the gods. The fact that even in the least obscure passage in which the identification is generally admitted by Vedic scholars, viz. that which refers to the wedding of Soma and S\u016bry\u0101 (X, 85), the lunar nature of Soma is alluded to as a secret known only to Br\u0101hmans, indicates the incipient character of the conception. The brilliance of Soma is constantly brought into relation with the sun, but this is often vaguely expressed. It is only in these vague passages that the lunar Soma of later belief can be discovered (cp. p. 184). At the same time Oldenberg\nadmits that amid the fanciful and chaotic imagery of the Soma hymns may lurk a casual identification of the celestial Soma and the moon, or reference to the swelling of the moon as parallel to the swelling of the Soma plant. But with the few exceptions generally recognized in the later Rigveda, and possibly some others, the position that the god Soma in the Rigveda is on the whole a personification of the terrestrial plant and juice, remains unshaken. If this be so, the latter half of the hypothesis, that the worship of the moon dominates the religious thought of the Rigveda, necessarily falls to the ground. It should be added that Prof. Bloomfield admits Hillebrandt's former contention, but rejects the latter (Amer. Journ. of Phil., vol. xiv, p. 491 f.).\n\nThe greater part of the second half of the volume (pp. 302-523) brings together and critically treats, with a masterly command of the material, all that is at present known concerning the various kinds of sacrifice, the different fires, the priests, ceremonies, festivals, prayer, and magic in the Vedas. A prominent and important feature is the very wide utilization of ethnological literature for the purpose of discriminating ancient inheritance from new development. Hitherto the study of Vedic religion has, to its detriment, been isolated from the light which the science of ethnology is capable of shedding on it. One widely diffused primitive conception which the Indo-Europeans must have inherited from an earlier stage, but I think not referred to as such by Oldenberg, is the notion of heaven and earth being the universal parents.\n\nFrom a general point of view Oldenberg shows that the ritual indicates the quite predominantly benevolent character of the great Vedic gods, as the endeavour to ward them off by prayer or offerings of food is a rare trait, chiefly apparent in the cult of Rudra. Among the lesser demoniac powers the hostile predominate; while the souls of departed fathers are treated as both friendly and uncanny. The Vedic sacrifice being intended to elicit the favour of the gods, is accompanied by prayers. Thanksgivings are almost entirely absent, the Vedic language, in fact, not knowing\nthe word to thank (p. 305). The general attitude of the sacrificer of the Rigveda is the endeavour to evoke the benevolence of a deity by satisfying, strengthening, exhilarating him with the offering, which is chiefly Soma, in the expectancy of an abundant recognition of such attentions. A few passages are, however, found in the Rigveda, in which the sacrificer is regarded as exercising a kind of magical, compelling influence on the deity. But such a notion is rare, and is probably to be regarded as an incidental fancy. This conception of the power of the priest became a conspicuous feature in the period of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, where the relative importance of the gods and of sacrifice is inverted, the gods being mere shadows and sacrifice all-powerful. The chief source of this view Oldenberg sees in the mixture of two originally separate spheres, sacrifice and magic, which Bergaigne does not sufficiently distinguish (p. 315). The way in which Vedic ceremonies, as shown by him, are everywhere permeated by magical notions is highly interesting and important.\n\nThe magical fire for warding off injurious spirits, which is the more primitive, being spread over the whole earth among races in a low stage of civilization, is not to be found in the Vedic cult. It has become amalgamated with the ordinary sacrificial fire, but is, according to the author, represented in the more elaborate ritual of the three fires by the southern (dak\u1e63\u012b\u1e47a) fire, for it is from the south that the souls of the dead and cognate uncanny spirits approach (p. 340).\n\nThe only perfectly certain trace of human sacrifice in Vedic times in Oldenberg\u2019s opinion is to be found in the rite connected with the building of the fire-altar, in which a man, horse, bull, ram, and he-goat are prescribed as the five victims. The \u015aatapatha Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, however, speaks of this as a thing of the past, substitutes being then already in vogue (p. 364). The weight to be attached to ancient legends like that of \u0160unah\u015bepa must, he thinks, remain doubtful.\nWith regard to the differentiation of technical priests in the Rigveda, Oldenberg's argument (p. 396) against the existence, at least in its oldest portions, of the Brahman specifically so called, is not very clear. The name occurs as the last of seven in the oldest list of technical priests (RV. II, 1, 2); but it can be proved according to Oldenberg that he represents not the Brahman of the later ritual, but the Brahmana\u015bchamsin. If this be so, it would have been advisable to adduce the proof more distinctly. In any case, the oldest Vedic ritual knew seven priests with distinct functions. It is of interest and importance to note that the Avesta has eight, the chief of whom, the Zaotar, who in the Iranian Soma sacrifice recited the g\u0101th\u0101s, corresponds in name and function to the Vedic reciting priest, the Hotr. The names of the remaining Avestan priests point to the same sacerdotal actions as those with which the Vedic Soma sacrifice is concerned (p. 385). This shows how elaborate the ceremonies of the Soma sacrifice must have been even in the Indo-Iranian period. The dik\u1e63\u0101, or consecration preparatory to a rite, is, as Oldenberg points out, one of the observances to be found among the most diverse primitive peoples. Its real object is to bring about intercourse with the gods by inducing an ecstatic condition. An important means to this end was fasting, which was regarded as resulting in enlightenment and supernatural power of various kinds. Traces are already to be found in the Rigveda (cp. especially X, 136) of the power of religious austerity, tapas, originally exposure to heat; which attained such an inordinate development in later India.\n\nThe last section (pp. 524\u201397) describes the Vedic methods of burial and beliefs regarding life after death. The author makes it probable that even the Rigveda\u2014the later Vedas show it clearly\u2014alludes to a belief in hell, in opposition to the view of Roth, who held that only heaven, as the abode of the righteous, is referred to, the existence of the wicked being ended by death. But this latter view conflicts with the universal primitive belief in the continuance of all life after death. Oldenberg, in agreement with Zimmer\nand Scherman, also sees positive traces of the belief in hell in the Rigveda.\n\nWith regard to the question of widow-burning, the author points out that ethnologically the practice is on the same level as that of giving the dead man clothes and ornaments to wear in the next world, a primitive custom not only widely diffused, but still clearly understood in the Veda (p. 586). Just as the bow placed in the hand of the deceased is in the funeral rite of the Rigveda removed from it, so the widow ascends the funeral pyre of her dead husband only to be recalled from it to the world of the living by a special ceremonial act. This is clearly a relic of the ancient custom of widow-burning, which, though undoubtedly excluded by the Vedic ritual, was far from being an invention of later Brahmanism, and probably never, even in the earlier period, fell entirely into abeyance through the authority of the Veda. All this has long ago been clearly shown by Prof. Tylor in his Primitive Culture.\n\nThough it has only been possible in this review to touch upon a few of the questions dealt with by Prof. Oldenberg, what has been said probably suffices to show how important and valuable a contribution his book is to our knowledge of the religion of the Veda.\n\nArthur A.

Morrison, of Victoria, Australia. Although this seems to be the author's first book of travels, yet he has evidently wandered in many lands and he is a seasoned traveller.\nThe journey described in this book is one which has already been made by several travellers, some of whom have written and published accounts of their journeys. The best of these accounts were apparently read by our author before he set out on his travels, or at least before he wrote his book. Indeed, the present work differs from most other books of travel in China in this respect (along with others), that the traveller had acquired some information about China and the Chinese, and the particular line of country which he was to traverse, before he started on his journey.\n\nOur author went by steamer from Shanghai to Hankow and on to Ichang, the head of steam communication on the Yangtze up to the present. From Ichang to Chungking the traveller ascended the great river in a native boat, known as a Wupan or Five Planks. This was a small uncomfortable craft in which to go up the gorges and over the rapids. Our author's account of these is very brief, but true and picturesque. He does not mention all the gorges, and his attention does not seem to have been directed to the noteworthy objects in two of them.\n\nAt Chungking Dr. Morrison made a halt of a few days, and during his stay he made the acquaintance of all the foreign residents, especially the missionaries. From this, on through Western China, the journey was made by land, the traveller being dressed as a \"Chinese teacher.\" For the most part he trudged along on foot with his coolies, as he was not able to afford a sedan. He did indulge in the luxury of a sedan for a short distance, and he also made part of the journey on mule- or pony-back. The Chinese all along the route seem to have treated him fairly well, and he does not fail to give those who served him faithfully their due meed of praise. He also sums up the characteristics of the Chinese, that is of the Canton, artizans, in a few sentences (p. 223) which are as near the facts as an Australian could attain. His journey was uneventful, and he arrived safely at Bhamo, from which he continued his travels to Mandalay and Rangoon, and from the last by steamer to Calcutta.\nDr. Morrison's book is written throughout in a cheerful, humorous spirit, pervaded by a half-repressed tendency to levity and sarcasm. What he has to say he says in clear, terse language; he tells his stories well, and there is not a really dull page in the whole book. Moreover, for second-hand information and opinions derived from others, he is careful to cite his authorities. Our traveller seems to have a catholic appreciation for missionaries of all sects, whose zeal and energies, however, he apparently thinks are misapplied. But his remarks on the various mission stations, the work and the visible results, are worthy of attentive perusal. So also are all his statements about opium-smoking and poppy-cultivation as he saw them on his journey, and about the traffic in female children and infanticide. It should be remembered, however, that our traveller knew only about a dozen words of Chinese, which he probably did not pronounce correctly, and that he had no interpreter when away from the missionaries.\n\nThe book has numerous photographic illustrations, and it is furnished with an index and a sketch-map. It is well printed, and is free to a remarkable extent from typographical and other mistakes.\n\nA second edition of the work will in all probability be soon required, and there are a few inaccuracies in it which the author may like to have corrected. He seems to go too far in what he states and suggests about the \"Rice Christians\"\u2014that is, those Chinese who become Christians for the sake of immediate worldly advantages to be obtained from the missionaries. The author does not seem to know that there are many thousands of native Christians, even among the Protestant sects, who not only do not derive any pecuniary gain from their connection with the religion but even contribute to the support of the mission stations. No doubt some of the very low-class Chinese do profess themselves Christians merely with a view to a regular supply of rice and tea, but these should be regarded as exceptions. On this subject our traveller quotes a missionary, the Rev. C. W. Mateer, as stating,\n\"The idea (derived from Buddhism) is universally prevalent in China that everyone who enters any sect should live by it.\" This seems to be utterly wrong and misleading, for sects in China, with the exception of Christianity, require to be supported by their adherents. As to Buddhism, everyone knows that the Buddhist layman not only does not live by his sect but that he is called on by his religion to support the monks and keep up the temples and the religious services.\n\nOn p. 77 and in other places the word for \"Yamen-runner\" would be more correctly and intelligibly given as Ch'ai-jen instead of Chairen. So also on the same page Goushun! goushun! probably means \"Promotion! promotion!\" (Kao-sh\u00eang! kao-sh\u00eang!). The author's translation \"A little more! a little more!\" is, however, the practical result at which the Yamen-runner was aiming.\n\nAt p. 209 we read of the gaols of China, \"or, as the Chinese term them, 'hells.'\" This is putting matters wrongly. The Chinese do not call their prisons \"hells,\" but they call the latter \"earthly prisons.\"\n\nT. W.\n\nIV.
