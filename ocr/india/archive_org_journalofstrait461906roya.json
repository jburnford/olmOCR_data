He lived long ago and it was in his time that men-folk began to appear in the world. When he saw how they caught the beasts both wild and tame, and made them do all sorts of work, and how they even made the wind drive their boats on the sea, he began to get alarmed lest he, too, should be caught. So one day he went down to the sea-shore and assembled all manner of beasts\u2014the jungle people, and spoke to them \"O, all living things, come away with me over the sea to the sky's edge. This is no place for us. See how mankind is catching all the beasts and making them work.\" But, said the Beasts, \"Why should we go so far? What will we do over there?\" Said the Buffalo: \"if the men catch me, I will kill them with my horns.\" Said the Horse: \"if the men catch me, I will slay them with my heels and teeth.\" So spoke all the Beasts, each boasting of his own weapons, for indeed they had no wish to go so far as the sky's edge. These replies troubled the mind of Sang Kelembai so he took all his possessions, his fishing nets and his rombong baskets, and having burnt them to ashes, he departed alone to the sky's edge. Soon after the human folk came down to the sea beach and there they found the ashes and the remains of the nets and rombongs. They carefully examined the meshes of the nets and the weaving of the basket work and tried to copy them. One of the women went home to her daughters and said \"Let us get some pandan leaves, and split them and then dry them.\" They did this and in the night came the rain and soaked the leaves, and next day the sun shone and\nbleached them. Then they tried to weave them like the goblin's baskets, but their efforts were in vain. Day after day they tried but could not succeed. At last a fairy in the guise of a woman came by. She saw the women sitting distracted in the house and said to them.\n\n\"Oh ye who sit within the house distracted,\"\n\"Striving to learn the craft of Sang Kelembai,\"\n\"Come ye while I the daughter of the fairies,\"\n\"Teach you to weave the web of the distracted.\"\n\n\"So the Fairy taught them to find the long mengkuang leaves, to split them, to dry them, to supple them, to bleach them.\" Everything she taught them, and when the baskets were finished with their ornaments, she said \"Now you understand the Distracted Weaving, and why it is called so. You work at it till your eyes are dim and your brain reels, till the back aches, and the hands grow weary, but still it does not come right.\"\n\nThis ancient industry exists to the present day amongst the Malay women at Tanjong Kling in Malacca. The baskets are woven of mengkuang, which grows there in great quantities. This mengkuang is a screw-pine or Pandanus (Pandanus fascicularis) and there are many other species also used by the Malays for weaving mats and coarse baskets and known by them as Pandan, but the particular screw-pine used at Tanjong Kling is called mengkuang. It is very supple and therefore suited to the special weaving done at Tanjong Kling. The latter is of a very distinctive and uncommon character and is called the \"Anyam Gila,\" or mad weaving. It is very intricate to learn and quite calculated to drive a beginner mad. The mengkuang requires a good deal of preparation before it is fit for use, and the old women are generally employed in this work. They cut the long prickly leaves down with a native knife, or parang, (plate 4. fig A) and carry it home in large bundles on their heads. Then they dry or \"layor\" it slightly over a fire of sticks, and cut off the thorns which grow down the spine of the leaf. This divides the leaf into two wide strips and for this purpose they use a smaller knife\n\nJour. Straits Branch\n(pisau) than the parang (Pl. 4. fig B). Next they \"jangka\" or divide, the half leaves into strips by means of a rude implement called a \"jangka\" (Pl. 4. fig C). The \"jangka\" is a flat piece of wood with brass spikes fixed into one end at regular intervals, the intervals being decided by the width of strand required (the widths vary from one inch to one eighth of an inch). In this process the thorny edges of the leaves are disposed of, and many are the scratches and wounds inflicted on the workers. The thorns of the mengkuang point upwards on the edges of the leaves and downwards on the spine so one can easily imagine they are difficult to avoid in handling the leaves. Now the green strands are ready as far as size goes, but they leave yet to be made supple and smooth or \"lurut.\" The implement for this process is the \"Pulurut\" or a piece of hollowed bamboo, which is pulled over the leaf many times by the left hand with a sort of curling movement (Pl. 4. fig. D). The leaves are now folded into compact bundles and soaked in a bowl of cold water (pasoh rendam) for three nights, changing the water twice a day. After this they are laid in the sun and bleached for a day, and woe betide the mengkuang if it gets a drenching by mistake: It would then all go black instead of the pretty greeny grey white, which is desired. The mengkuang is now ready for use.\n\nThe construction of the baskets or \"rombongs\" is complicated, and much more tedious than many people imagine. It starts from a star of six strands called by the Malays \"Pusat Belanak\" or the navel of the \"Belanak\" fish, a species of mullet. This produces twelve strands, for the weaving is done with both ends of every strand used. It is this that makes the describing of the work so very difficult. The whole basket is built up by the continual interweaving and crossing of the inner and outer strands, and there is no foundation of warps round which to weave, as in English baskets. It is built up continuously round and round by weaving as in knitting a stocking. The last strand in a round is called by the Malay the \"mati.\" The basket is begun in the centre by a star of six strands. To this is next added six more strands, then round these are woven in twelve more, then twelve more and soon till the size required\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 46, 1906.\nis achieved (plate 1). A six-sided shape is thus produced. The added strands are woven in always two at each corner, \"buku\" or \"susoh\" as Malays term it, and the full \"mata gila\" or mad stitch is achieved after the second round. The strands that go from left to right from the weaving strand or \"daun anyam.\" The weaving strands over and under which the other strands are pulled and folded are also used for determining the size of the basket. How many \"matas\" or stitches? the Malays will say when you order a basket. The \"daun selang\" or crossing strand, and the \"daun betul\" or warp strand are the only other names possible to mark the distinctive action in the \"Anyam Gila.\" When the size is determined on and woven, a piece of split rattan is inserted and the sides of the basket next made, and in the weaving the rattan is completely hidden. The strands of the mengkuang are glossy on one side only, so the Malays by carefully turning their work, arrange that the basket should be glossy both inside and out. The sides are woven round without any adding and it is a relief to the weary worker when this stage is achieved. The Malays, of course, work sitting on the floor (plate 2) and complain of the fatigue they endure\u2014pains in the back and nape of the neck. I can testify to all this inconvenience for when learning I tried every position to obtain ease but in vain. The height achieved, another rattan is inserted. This rattan is covered with a strip of mengkuang, which process is called \"bubor\" or \"Susop\" mengkuang. In plate 2, a basket ready for this second rattan is shown by the side of the worker. It resembles a cutlet frill at this stage. Then the strands are all worked back again, the glossy sides being now towards the worker. This is a tedious process and called by the Malays to \"sesep\" or insert. They use an implement of wood and brass called the \"penysep\" or inserter which resembles very much the prickers used by the American Indians in their basketry (pl. 4 fig E). It is often strengthened and ornamented by European treasures, such as a brass thimble and an empty cartridge case and in the very coarse work I have seen used a clumsy \"penysep\" made entirely of wood. The strands are slipped over their respective duplicates till the\nbottom centre of the basket is reached when they cross each other for strength and are cut off invisibly. On the way the pretty designs are made by twisting the strands between thumb and forefinger. This produces a raised ornamental twist which is very attractive. The ornamentation is done by twisting the strands, and starts from a single stitches called \"Bras Goring,\" or rice grains, and a star of six such stitches called \"Bunga Tanjong\" flower of *Mimusops lengi* and a hexagon built round the \"Bunga Tanjong\" called the \"Bunga Kuntum,\" or flower bud. These simple patterns are worked into large and small triangles and diamonds called \"puchok rebong\" or bamboo shoots, or \"potong baji\" or wedges. Combinations of triangles are called \"puchok rebong berantai\" or festoons of bamboo shoots, and \"bunga tiga bersegi berantai\" or festoons of 3 sided ornaments. The edging round all the baskets is called \"bunga pending,\" or belt (Pl. 5). The lids are made in a similar manner of the same number of strands as the bottoms only woven slightly more loosely. The women make and sell their baskets in nests or \"susun\" of five baskets, each basket fitting into another very nearly (Pl. 3). There should only be the difference of two strands between each size. The baskets are made in various shapes and forms\u2014square, long, oval, triangular, and diamond-shaped (Pl. 3 and 5). All are built up in the same way, starting with a six sided basket but with added strands to bring to any other required shape. This is an art by itself and many who can make hexagonal baskets cannot make other shapes, therefore the hexagonal are the cheapest; 50 cents extra being asked for the fancy shapes. The long and the square are the most difficult. They also make a basket of tiers, one on top of another, the lid of the lower basket making also the bottom of the next, and so on. This they call a \"tengkat\" and it is now almost a lost art. Another fancy shape is the \"tudong gelok\" (a pointed-shaped cover). They also make very coarse, large ornamented baskets which are much bought by Europeans for carrying clothes (plate 3). The women who make these live at Tanjong Kling, but all in a separate quarter of the kampong from the finer workers. It takes them a month to make a nest of very\nordinary weaving, while a fine nest takes from three to four months to complete and this means daily steady work. For the ordinary hexagonal nests they earn from $2.50 to $3.00, and for a fine one from $4.00 to $5.00. When this is calculated out it cannot be said that the industry is overpaid, yet there are many who think that it is, and that, in spite of the increased cost of living. There are now about forty or fifty experienced basket workers living at Tanjong Kling besides many beginners. Formerly only ten women made baskets. The demand has greatly increased, for people have begun to order the baskets in great quantities for home bazaars, where they are much appreciated. The industry in a way is suffering as the women are making more carelessly and rapidly to meet the demand. Five old women come into the town every second day in order to sell the work of the village, they are old and more or less blind and now unable to weave themselves. They walk fourteen miles to sell the work of their younger sisters. The chief distinctive feature in the Tanjong Kling weaving is that they use no dyes and also always ornament their \"mata gila\" with raised designs (Pl.3). In Province Wellesley the same weaving exists, but in a smaller degree, and there few ornamental designs are made and no rattans are inserted. I believe along the Malacca Coast the \"Anyam Gila\" may be found at Tanjong Bidara and also Kuala Linggi. I have also seen baskets and tobacco-pouches of this weaving obtained from Sumatra, Kelantan, Perak, Kedda, and Siamese territory in the Malay Peninsula. Some of the specimens were extremely fine, finer than any Malacca work now obtainable\u2014and ornamented with dyed strands, sequins, and gold filagree work.\n\nI have confined myself in this paper solely to this one style of weaving the mad stitch, but hope later to send further notes on other and more simple forms of basket weaving practised in Malacca. It is very curious that the ornamented \"Anyam Gila\" should be confined to Tanjong Kling only in Malacca, and any light that can be thrown on its origin and history would be very interesting. The female prisoners in the Singapore Gaol are made to learn \"Anyam Gila\" and a better\npunishment could hardly be devised. It has reduced many to tears. It was started under the auspices of the late Mr. O'Sullivan who happened to have amongst his prisoners a Province Wellesley basket-maker. With the help of Mrs. Hansen, the Matron, the industry has been firmly established there, and it is owing to her assistance also that I have been enabled to master the details of the industry and to make a basket myself. Native teachers are hopelessly poor and Mrs. Hansen deserves great credit for the way in which she has excelled in this difficult art. She has evolved a very pretty fan at Mr. Bland's suggestion in the \"Anyam Gila\" which is sold for the ridiculous sum of 75 cents at the gaol (Pl. 3). She has introduced many new designs for ornamenting the fans but the small and constantly changing number of prisoners renders the supply very limited and uncertain.\n\nEXPLANATION OF PLATES.\n\nPlate 1.

Soc., No. 46, 1906.\nThe Election and Installation of Tungku Muhammad, C.M.G.\nBin Tungku Antah, as the Yang Di Per Tuan Besar, Negri Sembilan\n\nBy E. W. Birch\n\nI have been induced to publish the story of how the ancient constitution of the Negri Sembilan was restored. It will be conceded that it is easier to overthrow than re-establish the constitution of a country. The event I am about to describe being one of very deep importance to the Chief and people of the beautiful State that lies between Malacca and Selangor. A brief reference to the history of the Nine States and to the establishment of the dynasty, represented by Tungku Muhammad, is first necessary.\n\nNo dates have been handed down to define the time at which the descent of a great number of Sakai from the hills peopled the countries of (1) Klang (now Selangor), (2) Naning (now a portion of Malacca), (3) Jelai (now a district of Pahang), (4) Segamat, and (5) Pasir Besar (now included in the State and Territory of Johor), (6) Johol, (7) Sungei Ujong, (8) Rembau, and (9) Jelebu.\n\nFour Batin, or Sakai Chiefs, were the leaders of this colonisation: one, a woman, remained with her following in Johol; the other three, with their adherents, occupied Klang, Sungei Ujong and Jelebu.\n\nThese four Lawgivers (undang yang ampat) are repeatedly referred to hereafter, but it should here be stated that the state of Rembau has succeeded to the position formerly held by Klang.\n\nJour. Straits Branch, R. A. Soc., No. 46, 1906\nAs time rolled on other people were attracted to these countries and there was free immigration from Menangkabau. The new arrivals brought their tribal customs with them, and, as the terms \"Waris\" and \"Lembaga\" will recur, it will be well to point out that there is only one Sakai, or Waris, tribe\u2014viz., the \"Suku Beduanda\"\u2014while there are several Menangkabau tribes, the elected head of each being known as the Lembaga or manager of the tribal system.\n\nThe Sakai and the people from Menangkabau maintained the most friendly relations, but it became evident that over the Nine States there must be some Suzerain to whom inter-state disputes could be submitted for adjudication: and, through the good offices of the Ruler of Johor, a deputation to Menangkabau was arranged and a Prince of that royal family was induced to come over.\n\nIn the year 1773, or thereabout, Raja Mel\u00e9war was installed by the four Lawgivers as Yang di per Tuan Besar, and he took the title, by which he and all his successors have been known, of Yam Tuan Besar, Sri Menanti. That beautiful valley which it is impossible to traverse without halting repeatedly to feast one's eyes on the scenery of hills, green or golden padi, and feathery bamboos had already been occupied by Menangkabau settlers, and they had so named it because, on their arrival, they found padi in the ear, ripe, awaiting them. There the Astana was built and the site then selected has become the ancestral home of the Raja.\n\nMeanwhile other districts had been opened by settlers. The gaps, caused by the defection or alienation of five of the original Nine States, were filled by Ulu Muar, Ter\u00e2chi, Jempol, Gunong Pasir, and Inas. Subsequently Tampin and Gemencheh, settlements from Rembau and Johol, were added.\n\nGradually the constitution was built up and strengthened, but, about thirty years ago, dissensions, inevitable in all histories, arose, and Rembau, Jelebu and Sungei Ujong were estranged.\n\nThen the healing interference of Great Britain commenced: by degrees Sungei Ujong (April, 1874), Rembau (March, 1884),\nJelebu (September, 1886), and Sri Menanti (June, 1887), were brought under British Protection.\n\nFinally, by the agreement of August, 1895, the Confederation of all the States, with one British Resident as Adviser to the Chiefs, was arranged.\n\nSuch was the condition of affairs when I assumed my duties as British Resident early in 1897. Apparently everything was in order, but enquiry proved that in matters relating to the constitution and Malay customs the greatest disorder prevailed. The Yam Tuan of Sri Menanti had not been installed: he had merely been declared to be Yam Tuan by British authority in June, 1887: there had been no formal creation of a Yam Tuan since the installation of Tungku Antah his father, and even then the Rembau and Jelebu Chiefs had not attended: of the four Lawgivers, Johol alone admitted allegiance to the Yam Tuan: the other three declared that they were absolutely independent and that their independence had been recognised by the wording of the agreement of August, 1895.\n\nThe secret of success with Malays consists, to a great extent, in the recognition of the fact that the mainspring of their life, political and social, is built upon the word \"adat.\" Their customs are their inheritance: they regard them as their birthright and they are an absolutely conservative people. I hope that it is not unfair to say that some English administrators, who have been very popular with Malays, have fallen into the error of pandering to the Malay veneration for custom. They have put off reforms forgetting as it were that many Malays possess that true conservatism which while tenacious of the constitution, is ready to accept useful measures of reform.\n\nMy experience had taught me that the Malay is a very reasonable person, and the Malays of Malacca and of the Negri Sembilan at all events have in a comparatively short space of time consented to the demolition of their ancient but obsolete land customs. It was not without a considerable show of opposition that their consent to that demolition was\nobtained but knowing that they will generally yield to the arguments of them whom they trust I was hopeful that though at the sacrifice of their self-importance, they would agree to re-establish their ancient constitution.\n\nThe opportunity arose in this wise:\u2014When the Hari Raya, or festival which succeeds the month of fasting, was approaching, the Yam Tuan invited the four Lawgivers to Sri Menanti to witness the ceremony of obeisance which is annually performed by the subjects of a Malay Raja.\n\nThey (Johol excepted) declined the invitation and made all manner of excuses, their only reasonable plea being that it was customary to receive the homage of their own subjects on the Hari Raya.\n\nThe Yam Tuan then arranged to invite them immediately after the festival of the Hari Raya Haji, and I asked them to attend. They urged that there was no reason why they should go, and expressed fears that their attendance might be construed to be a waiver of the freedom from interference which they then enjoyed in the internal affairs of their respective States.\n\nI invited them to a meeting at the Residency and explained that they were placing a strained construction upon the words of the agreement, that the British Government had never intended that they were to repudiate the Raja who was the representative of the dynasty their own ancestors had set up, that they were trying to override ancient custom by arguing on customs of thirty years\u2019 growth and that the machinery of the Negri Sembilan Government could not work until its component parts were replaced in their constituted places.\n\nThey replied that ancient custom required that they should instal the Yam Tuan, that Tungku Muhammad had not been invested with the powers and position of Yang di per Tuan Besar by them, and that they would be stultifying themselves if they went to Sri Menanti.\n\nAfter a hasty meeting with the Yam Tuan, who at once agreed to be formally proclaimed, I suggested to the three\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nmalcontent Lawgivers that they should draft an agreement in Malay setting forth their allegiance but providing for freedom from interference in internal affairs and for permission to celebrate the Hari Raya in their own States.\n\nThat agreement, when drafted, was submitted to and approved of by the Yam Tuan.\n\nTranslated it reads as follows:\n\n**Agreement between the Yang Di Per Tuan Besar, Sri Menanti, and the Four Lawgivers.**\n\nNow in all truth We, the Yang di per Tuan Muhammad, C. M. G., the son of the late Yang di per Tuan, Antah, have made an Agreement with the Four Lawgivers.\n\nI. The Dato' Klana Petra and the Dato' Bandar of Sungei Ujong.\n\nII. The Dato' Mendika Mentri Akhir Zaman Sutan of Jelebu:\n\nIII. The Dato' Johan Pahlawan Lela Perkasa Setiawan of Johol:\n\nIV. The Dato' Sedia Raja of Rembau.\n\n1. Whereas We and the Four Lawgivers and the British Resident have bound together the constitution and customs of the country and the heritage of Our ancestors of old time, as is related hereunder.\n\n2. Now the Four Lawgivers return to elect Us to be Raja of the Negri Sembilan in accordance with our ancient constitution.\n\n3. Now that We have been installed as Raja of the Negri Sembilan, We, according to the old constitution, cannot interfere in the customs of the country or in Muhammadan Law: and every matter that arises in each State is to be settled in consultation with the British Resident of the Negri Sembilan and is not to be subject to Our commands.\n\n4. If any difference of opinion arises between one Lawgiver and another as to the boundaries of their States, and if\neither Lawgiver appeals to Us by presenting himself before Us, then We are bound to interfere and to settle the matter with justice, but if the officers of the Four Lawgivers or their subjects come to present themselves before Us to make complaint or petition Us in writing, We shall not in future entertain their complaints.\n\n5. When the festivals of Hari Raya and Hari Raya Haji are celebrated according to ancient custom, the Four Lawgivers will not come to present themselves before Us at Our Astana, at Sri Menanti, but will each celebrate his own festivals, according to ancient custom, in his own State. Always provided that, on great occasions such as ceremonies of Marriage or Circumcision, if We invite the Four Lawgivers they shall carry out Our wishes in their entirety.\n\n6. In the event of the death of the Yang di per Tuan, the Four Lawgivers shall bring, as an offering, gold in such amount as is befitting, such offering being provided by the Government of the Negri Sembilan.\n\n7. Moreover the Four Lawgivers, in conjunction with each other and with their hereditary officers, shall elect one of the royal princes and instal him as Yang di per Tuan in the same manner and in accordance with the customs and constitution under which the former Yang di per Tuan was installed.\n\nBE IT SO.\n\nWritten on the 29th day of April, 1898, that is on the 8th day of Zil-haijah, 1315.\n\nThe date fixed for the ceremony was Saturday, the 7th of May, 1898. The procedure to be followed in summoning the four Lawgivers to Sri Menanti was adopted as closely as time permitted.\n\nWe had to take it for granted that the Tungku Besar had sent for the Dato\u2019 Ulu Muar, Dato\u2019 Ter\u00e2chi, Dato\u2019 Jempol and Dato\u2019 Gunong Pasir, and had announced to them that a Yam Tuan was about to be placed upon the throne.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nWe assumed the consent of the Dato\u2019 Ulu Muar and despatched his four chief Lembaga to convey the news to the four Lawgivers and call upon them to attend at Sri Menanti.\n\nThe To\u2019 Paduka Besar (Lembaga, Ulu Muar) went to the Raja di Muda (Lembaga, Ter\u00e2chi) and with him proceeded to Pantai and Rasah to wait upon the Dato\u2019 Klana Petra and Dato\u2019 Bandar of Sungei Ujong, respectively. Those two Chiefs, with all their following, returned with the two heralds to Ter\u00e2chi, which, according to ancient customs, is there restingplace.\n\nThe To\u2019 Sri Maharaja (Lembaga, Ulu Muar) went to the To\u2019 Andika (a retainer of Johol) at Cheriau and with him proceeded to wait upon the Dato\u2019 Johol Johan Pahlawan Lela Perkasa Setiawan. The aged Dato\u2019, who much wished to attend and who had requisitioned the District Officer for a pony and trap in order to do so, was ill and therefore sent the Dato\u2019 Baginda Tan Amas, who is his representative in the Council of State. He and his following, which included the Dato\u2019 Inas and all his Lembaga, instead of returning with the two heralds to Cheriau, their appointed resting place, came straight on to Kuala Pilah and proceeded the next day to Sri Menanti.\n\nThe To\u2019 Senara Muda (Lembaga, Ulu Muar) went to the To\u2019 Paduka Sri Maharaja (Lembaga, Gunong Pasir) and proceeded with him to the house of Sinda Maharaja (Lembaga, Rembau). After being informed of their business the Sinda Maharaja conducted them to the Dato\u2019 Rembau Sedia Raja. He, with all his following, was escorted by the two heralds to Gunong Pasir, which is set apart on State occasions as his resting place.\n\nThe To\u2019 Orang Kaya Bongsu (Lembaga, Ulu Muar) went to To\u2019 Lela Raja (Lembaga, Jempol) and requested him to summon the Dato\u2019 Jelebu according to ancient custom. Having given this message the Orang Kaya Bongsu proceeded to Sri Menanti and remained in attendance upon the Dato\u2019 Ulu Muar. The To\u2019 Lela Raja (Lembaga, Jempol) instructed Si Alang Puteh of Jempol to summon the Dato\u2019 Jelebu. He\nwith all his following, should have returned with the herald to Kampong Bukit, his recognised resting place, but proceeded instead via Seremban to Ter\u00e2chi, where he joined the procession of the Sungei Ujong Chiefs.\n\nTo all other Raja, Waris Chiefs, Lembaga, Penghulu and Malays of good position throughout the States news of the approaching ceremony was duly sent.\n\nI arrived at the Astana with Mr. Chevallier, the District Officer, Kuala Pilah, at about 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, the 5th of May, and found everything in a state of preparedness that spoke volumes for the trouble taken by the Yam Tuan and his household and by Mr. Chevallier. Mr. Bathurst, Mr. Parr and Mr. Hatchell arrived on Thursday evening. I selected these four gentlemen to look after the four Lawgivers and their people, and to see that their comfort was attended to. A great measure of the success of the whole pageant is due to the assistance they gave me: and the Yam Tuan expressly thanked them.\n\nI was told that the Dato\u2019 Rembau and the Dato\u2019 Johol had already taken up their quarters at Sri Menanti with large followings. We wrote letters to the other three Dato\u2019, who were at Ter\u00e2chi, advising them to stop the night there and come on next day.\n\nIt was decided to procure more rice from Seremban, as all the Kuala Pilah shops had been emptied, and we sent for more drapery for the reception-halls of the four Lawgivers, and for four and twenty large Malacca mats to cover the bamboo flooring of those halls.\n\nIt may be well to describe the Astana grounds, and the subjoined plans will assist the description:\n\nAn examination of the first plan will show that the distance from one entrance gate (E) to the other (F) was about 300 yards. These entrances (pintu gerbang) were covered with thatch and on each side there was an earthen platform on which cannon were mounted. The road from one gate to the other was broad and was lined on both sides\nwith bamboo poles with cross poles, say ten feet from the ground: along the whole length of the road a broad strip of yellow cloth was hung overhead and the entrance paths to the Astana (H) and royal balai (I) were similarly decorated. At the balai the royal yellow standard was flying from an orthodox flagstaff and the general mixture of yellow with the bright green of the grass and foliage was pleasing to the eye.\n\nThe second plan sufficiently explains itself.\n\nFriday, the 6th of May, was, unfortunately, appalling wet; but the rain did not check the constant stream of people that flowed in from every part of the Kuala Pilah district.\n\nAbout mid-day the Chiefs of Sungei Ujong and Jelebu arrived at Sri Menanti and took up their abode in the houses set apart for them.\n\nThe processions of people attending upon the minor Chiefs paraded the Astana grounds, during the brief intervals of sunshine, and helped to make the scene imposing. The party that came with the Dato\u2019 Gunong Pasir was strikingly picturesque: his procession was headed by some two hundred women who wore cloths of every conceivable colour, and immediately behind them came his personal attendants carrying spears decorated with the peacock feathers of Gunong Pasir. The Dato\u2019 himself walked next, dressed in a suit of striped silk, the preponderating colour being yellow: behind him followed one hundred men, and two hundred children of all ages brought up the rear of the procession.\n\nAt various places, outside the Astana grounds, the usual forms of amusement that are concomitant with every Malay gathering of importance were provided: I was specially struck with the many skilful exhibitions of boxing (silat), which never failed to draw large crowds and provoke much merriment.\n\nOn two afternoons football matches, Europeans and Malays against the Police, were played: on a third athletic sports were held and, though the afternoon was wet, were much enjoyed.\n\nR. A. Soc. No. 46, 1906.\nMost of the time on Friday was occupied on determining several nice points of procedure to be adopted in the ceremony of the morrow. The Sri Menanti people were, of course, in favour of introducing many forms which the older men, who had witnessed a previous installation, deemed to be essential. The members of the Yam Tuan\u2019s family were anxious to use every form of expression which would proclaim the dominance of his position, and, had it not been for the extreme good sense of His Highness, it would probably have taken three or four days to arrange the procedure.\n\nI had many consultations with the Dato\u2019 Bandar of Sungei Ujong, whose attitude throughout was firm but friendly, and I explained to the Yam Tuan that the Chiefs had made considerable concessions, that their patience ought not to be taxed in any way, and that the ceremony should be performed punctually and with as much expedition as possible. His Highness at once replied that his desire was to yield every point of minor importance. These discussions did not end till nearly midnight on Friday, but it was satisfactory to feel assured that every possible danger to the success of the very important event about to be celebrated had been removed.\n\nOn Saturday morning, crowds of people began to collect from every quarter: with the exception of an early shower, the weather was propitious. The placing of the royal umbrellas in front of the \u201cbalai penghadapan\u201d (the royal hall in which the installation took place) was the signal for an enormous concourse of people to collect at that spot.\n\nAt a quarter to eleven, a guard of honour of the Sikh Police was drawn up near the reception halls of the four Lawgivers: the first to arrive was the Dato\u2019 Rembau: I received him at the entrance to the \u201cbalai panjang\u201d and, after the guard had presented arms to him, we placed his followers in his reception hall and Mr. Parr conducted the Dato\u2019 to the Astana to put his signature and chop to the agreement with the Yam Tuan. Almost immediately afterwards, the Dato\u2019 Klana and the Dato\u2019 Bandar of Sungei Ujong arrived: the guard presented arms to them at the entrance to the \u201cbalai\nmelintang\u201d and after their followers had entered the balai, Mr. Bathurst conducted them to the Astana: meanwhile Dato\u2019 Baginda Tan Amas of Johol, followed by all the Datos and minor Chiefs of the Negri Sembilan (old), had arrived: the guard presented arms to the Dato\u2019 Baginda at the entrance to the \u201cbalai bertengkat\u201d and, after his following had entered the balai Mr. Chevallier conducted him to the Astana: a long wait occurred before the arrival of the Dato\u2019 Jelebu: he was received by the guard at the entrance to the \u201cbalai bel\u00e9rong. When his followers had entered it, Mr. Hatchell conducted him to the Astana. The affixing of the signature and chops of the Lawgivers to seven copies of the agreement being completed, I signed and placed the State seal upon them and they were then taken upstairs to the Yam Tuan who added his signature and chop. The four Officers named above then conducted the Lawgivers to their reception halls where they awaited their summons to the installation hall: in the meantime the Tungku Prempuan had taken her seat upon the dais to the left of the throne (Singgasana) and several ladies of high degree had been accommodated with seats in the places set apart for them: the yellow cushion, gold boxes, and other insignia of royalty were brought in and placed on the dais: Tungku Muda Chik, Tungku Ngah of Tampin, Rajah Kadir of Lukut, my four officers and I next took our seats in the body of the hall, and everything being ready the heralds announced that the Yam Tuan was coming to the hall: His Highness was preceded by the \u201corang ampat Astana\u201d and his \u201corang anam\u201d carrying the weapons of State: immediately behind him were the young Tungku Besar (his brother) and the still younger Tungku Laksamana (his brother-in-law), while a score or so of Rajas completed the procession.\n\nOn arrival at the hall, His Highness was received by a guard of honour: he entered the hall and took his seat upon the \u201cSinggasana,\u201d the \u201corang ampat Astana\u201d and the \u201corang anam\u201d stood upon the right and left below the dais and the Tungku Besar and Tungku Laksamana sat on the right and left of His Highness below the throne. The heralds sum-\nmoned the Lawgivers and the hereditary Chiefs, who were each conducted from their respective balai to the entrance to the hall by their Officers of State; they entered the hall alone and took their seats in the following order:\n\n1. The Dato' Klana Sungei\n2. The Dato' Bandar Ujong\n3. The Dato' Jeleh\n4. Dato' Baginda of Johol\n5. The Dato' Rembau\n6. The Tungku Besar of Tampin\n7. The Dato' Uln Muar\n8. The Dato' Ter\u00e2chi\n9. The Dato' Jempol\n10. The Dato' Gunong Pasir\n11. The Dato' Inas\n12. The Dato' Gemencheh\n13. The Dato' Muda Linggi\n\nThe two heralds (Bentara Kanan and Bentara Kiri) took up their positions on the right and left of the Yam Tuan.\n\nWhen all were in readiness the young Dato' Klana, rising, said, \"Oh, Bentara, proclaim to everyone that we the four Lawgivers have assembled here to place the Yang di per Tuan Tungku Muhammad upon the throne of Negri Sembilan.\"\n\nThe Bentara Kanan thereupon, standing on one leg, with the sole of his right foot resting on his left knee, holding his right ear open with his right hand and shading his eyes with his left hand, made proclamation as follows:\n\n\"Oh, gentlemen all, illustrious and humble, great and small, old and young, by order of the four Lawgivers, Tungku Muhammad, the son of the late Yam Tuan Tungku Antah, is proclaimed as Yang di per Tuan of the Negri Sembilan.\"\n\nThe people signified their homage by shouting three times, \"D\u00f4lat Tuanku.\"\n\nI then addressed the Yam Tuan as follows:\n\n\"I am very pleased that the Lawgivers and Lembaga and Officers and all the people from all parts of the Negri Sembilan have unanimously installed Your Highness as Yang di per Tuan and have re-established their ancient constitution, and that Your Highness has assented to their action. Now I will convey their wishes to the Resident-General.\"\n\nThe Bentara Kanan proceeded to call, by means of the following formula, upon each of the Lawgivers and on the\nHereditary Chiefs of Tampin, Muar, Ter\u00e2chi Jempol, and Gunong Pasir, to make obeisance:\n\n\"H\u00ea Dato' Klana Petra, who rules over the territory of Sungei Ujong, titah memanggil (His Highness summons you).\"\n\nEach Chief in turn replied, \"D\u00f4lat Tuanku:\" and one by one they emerged from the enclosure (ujong balai) in which they were seated, and squatting on the ground each proceeded along the floor (hadapan mejelis) making obeisance seven times until the dais was reached: there the Yam Tuan gave his right hand to the Chief, who, receiving it in both of his, reverently kissed it thrice and then retired, making obeisance five times as he receded.\n\nEach Chief rose and resumed his seat, with the exception of the Dato' Jelebu, who left the hall after he had done homage.\n\nThe Dato' Inas, the Dato' Gemencheh and the Dato' Muda Linggi made their obeisance together and all the chief Lembaga and Waris of the various districts entered and did likewise.\n\nThe Lawgivers then left the hall and retired to their reception halls and their places were taken by all those who were of Raja blood: they numbered about twenty five: they were almost all dressed in yellow, several with black headcloths, and, as they all moved up the hall, and, sitting below the dais, made obeisance three times in regular time, I was more impressed by the scene than by anything I have ever previously witnessed at any gathering of Malays. The Rajas were not commanded to come forward: it was an entirely voluntary act, but every one of them joined in it and it was a fine finishing touch to an imposing pageant.\n\nTungku Dris, Kathi of Tampin, the assistant Kathi of Kuala Pilah and some priests came in and offered up prayers for the Yam Tuan while the people stood with palms uplifted.\n\nAll being now over, the Yam Tuan rose and, after shaking hands with me, passed out of the hall and proceeded to the Astana, followed by all the Rajas.\n\nR. A. Soc. No. 46, 1906.\nThe ceremony, which had lasted two and a half hours, ended at 3 p.m. and the crowd quickly melted away.\n\nOn Sunday, at noon, he gave a breakfast to the Undang and made an interesting speech in which he pointed out that the constitution of the Negri Sembilan was now complete; there were now\u2014\n\nTHE YANG DI PER TUAN;\n\nTHE FOUR UNDANG (from Sungei Ujong, Jelebu, Johol, and Rembau); and\u2014\n\nTHE FOUR S\u00c9RAMBI UNDANG (from Ulu Muar, Jempol, Ter\u00e2chi and unong Pasir who, in the absence of the Undang, would represent them and would always do so by attending to make obeisance annually at the festival of Hari Raya).\n\nOn Sunday afternoon the various Chiefs left Sri Menanti to return to their homes, and early on Monday I went back to Seremban.\n\nThe above is a brief description of a ceremony that restored good feeling to a number of Chiefs who, for a generation, had been absurdly jealous of each other. Every person taking part in the ceremony recognised its importance and the calm and dignified reserve so characteristic of the well-born Malay was strikingly exemplified.\n\nThe concourse of people must have numbered from three to four thousand persons, and good humour reigned everywhere.\nAn Account of the Creation of the Dog.\n\nBy W. G. Maxwell.\n\nI heard this story from Pa' Senik, an old Kelantan Malay now resident near Batu Gajah in Perak. He was giving an account of the creation of the first man according to the Muhammadan tradition, which may be found in Sale's Notes to his translation of the Koran and in D'Herbelot's article \"Adam\" in his Biblioth\u00e8que Orientale; and the account of the creation of the dog was a mere parenthesis in his story\u2014It is new to me, and appears to be a Malay accretion to the Arabic myth.\n\nWhen Azrael had torn out the heart of the Earth and had fashioned it into the form of man, he left the moulded figure, which was still without life, on Bukit Zabaniah.\n\nIt lay there face upwards exposed to all the elements. Iblis passed that way and saw it, and, from malice, voided his excrement on its chest.\n\nWhen Azrael returned he flung the excrement away, and it immediately took the form of a dog.\n\nThe creation of the dog in this manner has had effect in two ways. In the first place, the dog, though an unclean animal may be bought and sold by Muhammadans, whereas the purchase money of all other unclean animals carries the taint of the unclean. In the second place, the Dog, however badly treated and however often thrashed, will always return to man.\nKun and Payah Kun.\n\nBy W. G. Maxwell.\n\nEvery student of pawang-lore is familiar with the terms kun and payah kun, which most frequently occur in such expressions as \"kun kata Allah, payah kun kata Muhammad\" (kun saith Allah, payah kun saith Muhammad), but no one has yet, so far as I am aware, discovered their meaning.\n\nKun presented no difficulty; it is obviously the Arabic \"let it be.\" But the antithetical term payah kun remained without a solution. My father suggested that it was a corruption of the Malay word supaia\u2014meaning \"in order that,\" and in this he is followed by Skeat,* but the sense thus derived from the sentence does not appear to be altogether satisfactory. Another suggestion was that the word was the Arabic fihi\u2014meaning \"to him.\" But this, too, seemed inconclusive.\n\nFor the solution of the puzzle I am indebted to Mr. J. C. Sugars, of the F. M. S. Civil Service. Payah kun is merely a corruption of the Arabic fa yakun\u2014meaning \"and it is.\" The correct reading therefore is \"kun kata Allah, fa yakun kata Muhammad.\"\n\n\"Let it be\" saith Allah: \"and it is\" saith Muhammad.)\n\n* Skeat, Malay Magic. p. 4.

The addition of the words \"saith Muhammad,\" though doubtless partly due to ignorance of the meaning of the foreign words and partly to the national love of an antithesis, appears also to be partly due to the zeal of a convert. And, it is interesting to note, not only is the addition of the two words wholly unnecessary, but the expression \"and it is, saith Muhammad\" would appear to a strict Muhammadan to be of very doubtful orthodoxy.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nThe Story of Kherudin.\n\nBy G. M. LAIDLAW.\n\nPenghulu Mat Nordin learnt this story of Kherudin many years ago from Mohamed Unus bin Mohamed Arip who, so far as is known, was of pure Perak descent.\n\nThe tale is told that once in the olden time there was a merchant called Mansur who had seven sons. Now he was very rich. But one day, owing to the will of God, he fell ill with many and very grievous sicknesses. Many doctors and medicine men tried to physic him but could not restore him to health. So one day he called his seven sons and at that time he declared his will to his eldest son, Zainal Abidin, his second son, Kamarudin, his third son, Shamsudin, his sixth son, Bahakudin, and to his youngest son, Kherudin, saying to them, \"Hai, Zainal Abidin, on this day have I made my will. As regards your younger brother Kherudin you must take very great care of him, for it seems to me that he is the one who will be most fortunate, indeed all of you will be able to obtain your living through him. Now on no account whatever are you to transgress this my will. If you do, I shall certainly curse you both in this life and hereafter and you will not obtain peace.\"\n\nHis son named Zainal Abidin made reply and said, \"It is good, my father.\"\n\nTwo or three days later Merchant Mansur returned to the mercy of God. After that Zainal Abidin called all the priests and preachers, hajis and lebais, to pray for his father. He also got ready the siraja diraja, that is to say the bier on which the body is carried to the grave. This was adorned with all sorts of most precious things. He gave away in alms many tens of thousands of dollars to all those of the faith who were there on the day that his father was laid in the earth. After he had completed the feast of the third day and\nof the seventh day and of the twice seven days and of the forty days and of the hundred days after all this work of the feasts had been settled, Zainal Abidin carefully followed out to the letter the will of his father as regards the upbringing of his youngest brother.\n\nAfter a very long time when Kherudin had grown up, the eldest brother made a plan with his younger ones to go on a trading voyage. They all replied that it was a most excellent plan. So after this meeting they ordered the second son of Kamarudin to get ready a very big ship and to load all sorts of trading things therein. After voyaging for some days they came to a country and the six brothers with Zainudin went to lay before the king of the country all sorts of offerings in homage, but the youngest brother was left to watch the ship. Now Kherudin had been given a hundred dollars by his eldest brother in order that he might buy anything that he fancied. This had been ordered in his father\u2019s will. While he was watching the ship, a certain man in the country who had been keeping a mangy dog began to think on this wise. \u201cWhat is the good of taking care of this mangy dog? The food that I give it is only a loss.\u201d So that day he made up his mind to destroy it by setting it adrift in the sea. But when the man reached the shore leading the dog with him and Kherudin saw that he meant to throw it into the sea, he said. \u201cWhat are you going to do with the dog?\u201d\n\nThe owner replied. \u201cI am going to set it adrift, because it is mangy and I cannot afford to feed it any longer.\u201d\n\nKherudin said, \u201cWill you sell the dog?\u201d\n\nThe man said, \u201cIf you want to have it, take it.\u201d\n\nKherudin said, \u201cIf you give it to me, I do not want it, but if you will sell it for thirty dollars I will buy.\u201d\n\nWhen the dog\u2019s owner heard that he replied gladly, \u201cTake it.\u201d So Kherudin paid over thirty dollars, and the man took it and went away back to his own house. A little later his elder brothers came back from the palace, and found Kherudin busy bathing his dog. They said to him. \u201cWhere did you get the dog?\u201d\nKherudin answered. \"I bought it just now for thirty dollars.\"\n\nThe five brothers said. \"The fellow is cracked, a ninny to throw his money about like that for no use.\"\n\n\"Don't be angry with him. It is not your money that he has given away.\"\n\nSome days later the elder brothers again went on shore to buy all sorts of merchandise to bring back to their own country and again Kherudin was left to take care of the ship. While he was on watch a man brought a mangy cat which he intended to throw adrift into the sea. Kherudin said, \"What are you doing with that cat?\"\n\nThe man with the cat answered, \"I am going to set it adrift in the sea.\"\n\nKherudin said, \"Will you sell it?\"\n\nThe owner of the cat answered. \"If you would like to have it, take it.\"\n\nKherudin said, \"If you merely give it, I do not want it, but if you will sell it for thirty dollars I will buy it.\"\n\nSo the owner of the cat said, \"Very good then.\" And Kherudin paid him the thirty dollars. The man went back to his house rejoicing. A short while after the six elder brothers came back from the shore and found Kherudin busy bathing the mangy cat. The five said to him, \"Where did you get this cat from next?\"\n\nHe answered, \"I have just bought it for thirty dollars.\"\n\nThey said to him, \"Are you a human being? Have you no brains? You are just like a beast, and when a man is like a beast, it is a very great curse indeed.\"\n\nThe eldest brother said, \"What is the use of being angry with him? It is not your money with which he bought it. I gave him that money. Let him buy whatever he likes. I don't mind.\"\n\nSo Kherudin lavished all his care on the dog and on the mangy cat and paid no attention to the trading voyage. He gave his whole energy to looking after the dog and the cat.\nAbout two days after this his brothers again went on shore to look for all sorts of things to trade and left him again in the ship. Then another man came along dragging a snake by a noose which he had fastened round its neck. He also wanted to kill it by throwing it into the sea.\n\nWhen Kherudin saw the man dragging the snake he said, \"What are you going to do with that snake?\"\n\nThe man said, \"I am going to kill it and throw it into the sea.\"\n\nKherudin said, \"Will you sell it?\"\n\nThe man said, \"If you want it take it.\"\n\nKherudin said, \"If you give it to me, I do not want it; but if you will sell it for thirty dollars I will buy it.\"\n\nThe man said all right. After that Kherudin paid the thirty dollars. When he had bought the snake Kherudin looked after it so well that his brothers never knew about it.\n\nNow it seemed that this snake was the king of all snakes, so in the middle of that night, all his ministers and all his subjects came before him. The ministers made obeisance saying, \"Your majesty, why do you live here? Why have you abandoned your throne? What is the fault of your servants? Have we not all obeyed your august commands? As far as we can remember never have your servants even on one occasion rebelled against your august commands.\"\n\nKherudin heard all that they said. The king snake replied, \"It was no fault of yours. Only it happened that one day as I went along by myself intending to look at the sports of mankind, while on the way I became thirsty so I went to look for water. While doing this I met with one of these folk, who struck me and intended to kill me and cast me into the sea. But then we met this man who redeemed me for thirty dollars, and that is how it happened that I did not die.\"\n\nThen all the ministers proceeded to present themselves before Kherudin and made obeisance saying, \"Your majesty, this snake which you have redeemed is the king of all the\nsnakes. If there is any pity any mercy in your majesty, your slaves trust to be allowed to return you this money.\u201d\n\nKherudin answered, \u201cEven if he is the king of all the snakes, yet we cannot give him back for we are fond of him.\u201d\n\nSo all the ministers besought him saying, \u201cIf your majesty will not allow us to give you money, then there is a certain fairy ring which we can present to you. Whatever your intention or whatever your wish may be, it will bring them all to pass.\u201d\n\nWhen Kherudin heard that, he said, \u201cIf that is true, you can take the king snake.\u201d\n\nSo all the ministers rejoiced greatly and besought permission to retire, which was graciously given them. The king snake was borne away on his ryots heads, back to his own country.\n\nThe next day the eldest brother, Zainudin, said, \u201cTomorrow we will sail home.\u201d\n\nKherudin heard what he said and saw that he had only ten dollars left. So he went on shore to buy all the fish scales and broken pots at the fish sellers\u2019 place. He bought every fish scale and broken sherd from those people who lived there for ten dollars. They were all very glad. Then he carried them all off and stored them in the ship. His eldest brother just noticed him, but the five others kept on grumbling and were angry with Kherudin for his mad conduct.\n\nAfter that on the next morning they set sail, and Kherudin was still more devoted to his mangy dog and to his mangy cat. After voyaging for seven days and seven nights they reached their own country. As soon as ever they arrived, the six brothers each took a present to offer as homage to the king.\n\nThe king said, \u201cThe six of you have each given me a present but your youngest brother seems to think that he need present no homage to me.\u201d\n\nThe eldest brother replied, \u201cIt is because this youngling, Kherudin has brought nothing whatever back with him.\u201d\nAfter that they all craved permission to return to their own house.\n\nWhen they got there the five brothers said, \"This fellow is of no value in the king's eyes. The rest of us all took a present. He alone took none. And so we were put to shame, for of course people will not say that we are rich, and of course people will not say that Merchant Mansur was our father.\"\n\nBut Kherudin was silent and made no reply.\n\nThe next day he went to his mother, Siti Rasimah, and said, \"Mother, mother, please go and bespeak the king's daughter in marriage.\"\n\nHis mother answered, \"Why, what resource have we? Certainly such poor people as we are will not be received by the king.\"\n\nHer son said, \"Please go, mother. You can but try.\"\n\nSo his mother went before the king and lifted her ten fingers in obeisance and made homage, saying, \"Pardon my lord, a thousand be the pardons vouchsafed to your most humble slave, who humbly craves for pardon. My child, my youngling, Kherudin has preferred a request. He desires to become your august majesty's slave, and to repair the broken flooring and the torn partitions in your palace.\"\n\nThe king quite understood what Siti Rasimah meant, so he said, \"I would like to give my child a husband, but Kherudin must first accomplish what I want and then, please God, I would accept him.\"\n\nSiti Rasimah made obeisance, \"Pardon, your majesty, your slave wishes to hear a little of the royal commands, what is your intention, what is your desire towards her in the dust at your feet?\"\n\nThe king said, \"First of all, he must make me a royal palace whose pillars are of mingled gold and silver and whose walls are of pure gold, and with a diamond cupola. Then secondly he must make a landing of gold from the palace right down to the sea. Then thirdly he must make a gold road between his house and my palace.\"\nWhen he had finished speaking Siti Rasimah became very sad and after she had obtained leave to depart she returned home weeping looking for her son, and saying, \"This time mother and child are indeed separated.\"\n\nKherudin saw her weeping and became very frightened. He said, \"Why are you weeping, mother? What has the king said?\"\n\nSo his mother told him all that the king wanted. Kherudin said, \"If that is all that the king wants, do not be frightened, mother; go and tell the king that whenever he wants it done, I am ready to do it.\"\n\nSo the next day Siti Rasimah again went before the king and made obeisance.\n\n\"Pardon your majesty a thousand pardons, when does your majesty desire to have this thing done?\"\n\nThe king said, \"I want it done in three days time from now. When it is quite finished I will marry my daughter to him at once.\"\n\nAfter that Siti Rasimah was given leave to return. She told her son all that the king wanted and Kherudin replied, \"Very good.\" So that evening he ordered his mother to make limes and cosmetics ready and also told her to sleep at another house for that night, so that he was left alone. In the evening when alone by himself he bathed and perfumed himself. At midnight he called out aloud, \"Oh! fairy ring that was given me by the king snake, if you really are a fairy ring, I ask you to make me a royal palace whose pillars are of mingled gold and silver and whose walls are of pure gold, and a landing place of pure gold from the palace to the sea side, and a pathway of gold from the palace to this house of mine.\"\n\nAt that very instant with a noise like thunder came all the jins and the king snake and all his ministers before Kherudin.\n\nThe king snake said, \"Why is my beloved troubled of heart?\"\n\nSo Kherudin answered, \"I have asked for the hand of the daughter of the king of this country, and he has asked me\nto make a royal palace and a landing place and a pathway of pure gold, and also that the palace should have a diamond cupola.\"\n\nThe king snake said, \"When does my beloved want this done?\"\n\nKherudin answered, \"I want it done to-night.\"\n\nSo that very night after the king snake had concentrated all his will on fulfilling Kherudin's request, everything came into being perfectly complete. The glamour of the palace burst all over the whole country side, and all the retainers and all the great men were terrified and went before the king. The king too was greatly astonished, but in a little while he recollected the request that he had made of Kherudin. Then he became very glad and told all his retainers; each of whom afterwards went back to his own house. The king was very pleased indeed to see what Kherudin had done. As soon as ever it was day, the whole population came together to see the king's palace. They were all astonished. When each one was satisfied with gazing on this most wonderful sight they all went back to their own homes.\n\nLater on Kherudin went to his mother and said, \"Mother, go and ask the king when he is going to marry me to his daughter.\"\n\nSiti Rasimah at once went before the king. When she reached the royal presence she made obeisance, lifting her ten fingers in homage, and said, \"Pardon your majesty, a thousand thousand pardons, your slave trusts peradventure to be pardoned for preferring her request, since she has for such a long time obeyed the royal behest. Your slave has been asked by her youngling Kherudin to enquire from your majesty what is to be done about your former promise.\"\n\nWhen the king heard Siti Rasimah's request he pondered thus in his heart: \"Of a certainty I spring from a race of kings who have come down from father to son from the olden days, and this Kherudin is the son of a merchant. If I marry my daughter to him I shall be put to shame when the kings in the other countries come to hear of it. But if I break my word he\nmay raise the country in revolt, and perhaps he might subdue it, for he is clearly a man endowed with many charms and magic powers.\"\n\nSo in thinking thus the king spake as follows: \"Very well, the marriage will take place in seven days time.\"\n\nWhen Siti Rasimah heard the king's words she went home and told her son all that the king had said. Kherudin was very glad. On the next day the king told one of his friends to call all his retainers together. And on that day all his ministers were gathered together. The king was seated on the royal throne of state and spake on this wise: \"Hai! one and all, retainers of mine, we have called you together to make preparations for the wedding of our daughter Princess Shamsiah with the merchant's son named Kherudin.\"\n\nAll the retainers made obeisance, saying, \"Pardon your majesty, a thousand thousand pardons, we are all willing to bow our heads beneath your majesty's commands.\"\n\nWhen the king had made an end of speaking and the retainers had finished their homage, the retainers all lifted their ten fingers, and obtained leave to return each to his house. The very next day the ministers all began to obey the king's behest: the days were like nights and the nights were like days, the whole country was in an uproar and all the inhabitants were gathered together. The blind were led in and the lame came on crutches.\n\nWhen the seven days and the seven nights were completed Kherudin was brought in procession to the king's house with all sorts of finery. Still more was lavished on the Princess Shamsiah. When Kherudin reached the royal audience hall it was crammed full with all the ministers, eunuchs, heralds, all the penghulus, the whole army of the common folk were in the royal hall. The king himself was present seated in state on his royal throne and he had called the kathi and had empowered him to marry his daughter to Kherudin. When the kathi arrived he came on bended knee lifting his ten fingers in homage, and when the king had fully confirmed the power bestowed and he had again lifted his hands in obeisance,\nhe went back to find Kherudin. When he got near Kherudin he ordered him to sit down on one knee. The kathi then read the marriage service, after that he spoke to Kherudin, and when he had made an end of that and he had prayed in all sorts of ways for the safety of the king's children, husband and wife, and for their parents and for all the people in the realm, when he had made an end of all that, they bore Kherudin into the palace and seated him next to Princess Shamsiah. All the men and all the women who saw the sight were very greatly pleased, for it was for all the world just like the moon encircled by stars. Next they brought the marriage cake of rice, which was ornamented in many ways. Both husband and wife partook of it. When they had finished eating they were next led by the eunuchs and female attendants into the royal bed-chamber, and the golden state curtain was lowered. Many were the terms of endearment that Kherudin lavished on his wife, but she bore herself most humbly. When Kherudin saw that, a great pity arose in his heart and he embraced her and fondled her with many sweet and kind words to soothe his wife's heart. So Kherudin came to love his wife.\n\nSome days after, Kherudin went out hunting. His wife made ready all sorts of provisions. He left behind his magic ring with his wife and set off with an army of retainers and with elephants and horses. While her husband was away hunting the Princess Shamsiah noticed that the setting of the ring was old and worn. So she ordered one of her attendants to call the most skilful Chinaman in the country. He quickly came to her presence and she ordered him to reset the ring in a more beautiful way. The jeweller said \"Very well.\" He obtained permission to return to his house. When he got there he had a good look at the jewel in the ring. Never had he seen so fair a gem. So that very night he ran away with it.\n\nAfter two days time Kherudin came back from hunting with all sorts of things that he had taken in the chase. When he reached his wife he asked for the ring. She replied that she had given it to a Chinaman to put it in a better setting. The princess ordered one of her servants to go and call the jeweller. When the servant reached his house she\nlearnt that he had run away. So she ran back to the princess and informed her. As soon as Kherudin heard what the servant said he swooned without saying a word. The princess was greatly distressed for her husband. An uproar arose in the palace and the king her father came to see why his son-in-law had fainted.\n\nWhile this was going on the mangy cat got to know what had happened to his master and he took counsel with the mangy dog.\n\n\"What will be the end of this thing? Our master has been in a swoon for several days because he has lost the fairy ring given to him by the king snake. I think that it is only right that we should go and look for this ring for that Chinaman has run off with it to some other country. If we cannot find it, the care spent on us by our master is quite useless.\"\n\nThe mangy dog replied, \"Go and get it, for I cannot look for it.\"\n\nThe mangy cat said, \"It is not that you are not able merely. You have no strength for it, for you have no love for your master.\"\n\nThe mangy dog said, \"It is not that I have no love for my master. I am very fond of him. But I do not know where on earth that ring has been taken by that Chinaman.\"\n\nThe cat said, \"If you do not know how to look for it, let me be the head and you can follow. But whatever I say you must do.\"\n\nThe mangy dog said, \"If it be arranged like that, let us go.\"\n\nAfter they had made this plan the dog and the cat set off, into forests, out of forests, up mountains and down mountains, into plains and across plains. At last they came to a village.\n\nThe dog said, \"I cannot walk any farther, for I am tremendously hungry.\"\n\nThe cat replied, \"I am hungry too. Since that is so, I had better go and look for some food. But let us make\nour plans first. I will go into the houses. If I find any food in the kitchen and if I can knock it down to the ground, you must at once snatch it up in your mouth and run off to the jungle.\u201d\n\nThe dog agreed, so the cat set off. He went into one house where he saw a cooking pot in the middle of the kitchen. So he went in and kicked it down to the ground. The dog snatched it up and ran off to the jungle and the cat followed him. When they got into the jungle they ate until they were satisfied and then being once more strong they went on their way. The mangy cat went into the towns to listen to the people talking but heard nothing. So they went on once more until they came to the sea side. There they saw an island.\n\nThe cat said, \u201cPerhaps that Chinaman is there, we must go across to the island.\u201d\n\nThe dog said, \u201cIf you are able to, come along.\u201d\n\nSo they set off swimming in the sea. They swam for a day and a night. At length both of them reached the island and climbed on shore. They walked about on the beach.\n\nThe dog said, \u201cHai, I can\u2019t walk any longer for I am very hungry.\u201d\n\nThe cat said, \u201cLet us look on the shore, perhaps we can find some fish which we can eat.\u201d\n\nIn a little while they found a big fish. The cat said, \u201cThat is the very fish we want, come and let us eat it.\u201d So the cat and the dog finished the fish. After that both of them went on. Every night they listened of news of the Chinaman to see if he was in the island. But he was not.\n\nThe cat said, \u201cWhat resource have we left now?\u201d\n\nThe dog said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, whatever you think I will agree to.\u201d\n\nThe cat said, \u201cWe had better go to some other country perhaps we will find that Chinaman there.\u201d\n\nSo they both swam away to another country. After a long long time they arrived and climbed on shore. The dog said, \u201cHai, cat, I can walk no longer for I am faint with hunger.\u201d\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nThe cat answered, \"Wait here then, while I go to look for some food.\"\n\nSo he set off. At last he met with a man who was busy smoking some fish. The cat hid in the grass close by and while the man went away to eat his dinner, he took five or six fish and went off with them to the dog. They both ate and when they were satisfied they went on together. When night fell they went to the house of a goldsmith, a Chinaman. The cat thought that this was perhaps the house of the man who had stolen their master's ring.\n\nThe dog said, \"How are you going to manage to get that ring if the ring is in the house?\"\n\nThe cat answered, \"I have a plan. It seems that this towkay is really the fellow who has stolen the ring.\"\n\nThe cat said to the dog, \"You wait on this side of the door and I will wait on that. If you see a white rat, catch it, but don't kill it.\"\n\nThe dog said, \"Very well.\" They each lay in wait on their side of the door. At last about midnight, a white rat came out on the cat's side and the cat caught it.\n\nThe white rat said, \"Don't eat me.\"\n\nThe cat said, \"Yes, I am going to eat you.\"\n\nNow the white rat was the king of all the rats in that country. When this occurred all the great men of the king rat came.\n\nOne of his retainers said, \"Do not, oh; Grandfather Cat, devour our king! Whatever you may want we will help you.\"\n\nThe cat said, \"Very good, there is a fairy ring in the inside of seven boxes belonging to this towkay. If you get that ring to-night, I will let your king go; if not, I certainly will eat him.\"\n\nThe retainer replied, \"Very well, if it is there, we will get it to-night.\"\n\nSo they pressed all the rats in that country and ordered them to bore into that Chinaman's box. So all the rats gnawed through one box after another, until the seventh.\nWhen they had pierced the seventh, one of the army of rats went in and searched about inside. There was only a small bundle of cloth but the rat felt that there really was a ring inside it. So he brought it outside and gave it to the cat. When the cat saw that it really was his master's ring he let the king rat go. So the king rat went off with his army of followers. The cat was very glad indeed and went to find the dog.\n\nThe cat said, \"Hai, mangy dog, I have got our master's ring. Come along home.\"\n\nThe cat carried the ring in its mouth. When daylight came the cat and the dog set off to swim across a very wide sea. The cat was not in the least tired owing to the power of the ring. But the dog got very tired and spent, so he said to the cat,\n\n\"Hai, let me carry the ring for a little, for I see that you are quite fresh.\"\n\nBut the cat said, \"You can't carry the ring now; perhaps you will let it fall.\"\n\nThe dog said, \"It won't fall.\"\n\nSo the cat gave it to the dog who put it in his mouth. The dog at once became a little stronger. But after a time the ring fell into the sea.\n\nThe dog said, \"Hai, our master's ring has fallen into the sea.\"\n\nThe cat said, \"I told you before that if you carried it, you would let it fall, but you said it would not. Now you have dropped it. And how are we to get it back again?\"\n\nSo they went on swimming till they got to an island at which they rested.\n\nThe cat said, \"We had better walk about on the shore.\"\n\nThe cat noticed a large fish rolling over and over on the shore. He thought, \"What a fat fish that is. I am hungry; I had better eat it.\"\n\nSo he said to the dog, \"Come along and eat this dead fish for I am very hungry.\"\nThe dog rushed off and began to eat. The cat also came and ate. The dog guzzled right into the fish's maw. When he broke it open he saw that there was a ring inside. The dog said, \"I have found a ring in the maw of this fish.\"\n\nThe cat said, \"Here! let me have a look.\"\n\nSo the dog gave it to the cat, and it actually was the ring that had fallen. The cat took it and put it in his mouth, and said \"Come along and let us swim back.\"\n\nSo they both swam away. At last after a very long time they reached land. They travelled on, day and night, night and day, until at last they reached their master's country. When they got below the house, Kherudin was still in a swoon. The cat tried to reach his master but was not allowed to get near. So at midnight when they were all asleep, the cat crept up into the house and went to his master and laid the ring on his breast. Then Kherudin sneezed and at once recovered consciousness and went away to his own bedroom. Nobody had noticed anything, so the people who were on guard at the place where Kherudin had swooned were very frightened the next morning when they saw that Kherudin had disappeared. So an uproar arose in the palace. Some one told the king that his illustrious son had disappeared from the place in which he had swooned. The king was very grieved to hear this. Later on in the day, at the time when the ploughman can glance round without being dazzled by the sun, that is to say at the time that you can lift your eyebrows, (about 9 a.m.) the princess Shamsiah came out from her bedroom and heard that there was an uproar in the palace because her husband had disappeared. So the princess ordered one of her servants to go and tell her father that Kherudin had recovered from his swoon and was in his own bedroom. So the maid servant ran off in a hurry to go before the king and said,\n\n\"Pardon, your majesty, a thousand thousand pardons, this your slave has come before your gracious majesty on the command of your daughter. The princess commands me to say that Kherudin has recovered from his swoon and is now in his bedroom.\"\nWhen the king heard this report his grief at once disappeared. While the maid was away seeing the king, Kherudin arose from his sleep. Both husband and wife then proceeded to bathe. When the bathing was over, they had breakfast. They lived together very happily.\n\nAfter a very long time the king abdicated in favour of Kherudin. As long as Kherudin was king the country increased in peace and became more and more populous. Kherudin was styled Sultan Kherudin Shah because he was so very wise and clever, and because he took such great care of all the natives of the land and because he so fostered all the strangers. His dignity increased and his name became more and more famous in the neighbouring lands.\n\nOne day he summoned all the great men of the country and all his brothers. When they were all assembled and he was seated on his throne of state, he made his eldest brother the chief minister of state and the other five brothers the keeper of his buffaloes, of his cattle, of his goats, of his sheep, and of his fowls, each with his separate work. And his kingdom became more and more firm. He may be reigning still, Heaven alone knoweth.\n\nThe Story of Kherudin.\n\nAlk\u0115sah maka ada-lah pada masa dahulu kala maka ada-lah sa\u2019orang saudagar nama Saudagar Mansur, maka ada-lah anak-nya laki-laki tujoh orang. Maka sangat-lah kaya-nya.

Mengangkat kadam jari sapuloh.\nThe proper way of making this obeisance is on bended knee. The hands are placed together open with the fingers touching each other. The thumbs also touch but are drawn well back. The hands are then carried up in front of the face and down again. If addressing the sultan the thumbs should be brought up above the end of the nose close to the eyes. If addressing the raja muda the thumbs should be carried to just below the end of the nose. When addressing others who are entitled to this salam the thumbs should not be carried higher than the chin.\n\n2.

Maka sap\u0113ninggal tuan salai p\u0113rgi makan nasi makan di-ambil-nya ikan lima anam ikor lalu dibawa-nya kapada anjing, lalu ia makan sama-sama d\u0113ngan anjing itu, maka masing-masing pun sudah k\u0113nnyang b\u0113r-jalan-lah ia kadua-nya. Maka hari pun malam p\u0113rgi-lah ia karumah tukang amas, orang china, maka fikir kuching, \u201cBarangkali ini-lah rumah china yang m\u0113nchuri chin-chin tuan kita itu.\u201d Maka kata anjing \u201cApa-akhtiar kamu h\u0113ndak m\u0113ngambil chinchin itu, jikalau ada chinchin itu di-dalam rumah ini.\u201d Maka jawab kuching, \u201cAda-lah akhtiar aku, maka rupa nya b\u0113tul sunggoh-lah towkeh di-dalam rumah itu m\u0113ngambil chinchin itu.\u201d Maka kata kuching, \u201cBaik kamu nanti di-sab\u0113lah pintu ini dan aku nanti di-sab\u0113lah pintu darat, maka jikalau kamu jumpa tikus puteh boleh kamu tangkap, t\u0113tapi jangan di-bunoh.\u201d Maka jawab anjing, \u201cBaik-lah ;\u201d maka masing m\u0113nunggu pintu, satu sa\u2019orang.\n\nKemdian lama-lama kira-kira sa-t\u0113ngah malam lalu sa\u2019ekor tikus puteh pada pehak kuching, maka di-tangkap oleh kuching ini tikus puteh. Maka kata tikus puteh, \u201cJangan-lah aku di-makan.\u201d Maka jawab kuching, \u201cAku h\u0113ndak makan juga.\u201d Maka ini tikus raja s\u0113gala tikus di-dalam n\u0113gri itu, maka antara d\u0113m-\nkian datang-lah segala orang besar-besar raja tikus itu maka kata sa'orang wazir raja tikus, \"Jangan-lah toh kuching, dimakan raja kami itu. Sabarang ka-hendak boleh kami tolong.\" Maka kata kuching, \"Baik ada satu chinchin kasaktian di-dalam peti towkeh rumah ini tujoh lapis, boleh kamu ambil itu chinchin ini malam juga. Jikalau dapat itu chinchin aku lepas-kan raja kamu ini, jika tidak tentu aku makan juga.\" Maka jawab wazir tikus itu \"Baik-lah jika ada tentu dapat juga ini malam.\" Maka ber-kerah-lah wazir tikus itu sekalian rayat-nya di-suroh-nya korek peti china itu. Maka di-korek-lah oleh tikus yang banyak itu tembus satu-satu pula, tembus satu pula hingga katujoh lapis-nya, maka apabila sudah tembus peti yang tujoh-nya itu, maka ada sa'orang hulubalang tikus itu masok-lah ia ka-dalam peti itu di-chari-chari-nya di-dalam peti itu ada satu bungkus kain kecil sahaja di-rasa'i tikus itu betul ada chinchin di-dalam-nya. Maka ia bawa keluar lalu di-beri-kan-nya kapada kuching itu. Maka di-tengok oleh kuching itu chinchin betul chinchin tuan-nya, maka di-lepas-kan oleh kuching raja tikus itu maka raja tikus pun ber-jalan lah ia dengan sekalian rayat belantara-nya dan kuching pun suka-lah hati-nya pergi mendapat-kan anjing kurap. Maka kata kuching, \"Hai, anjing kurap, chinchin tuan kita sudah aku dapat. Mari-lah kita ber-jalan balik.\" Dan chinchin itu kuching membawa-nya di-dalam mulut di-taroh-nya.\n\nKemdian apabila siang-lah hari bernang-lah kuching dengan anjing melalui laut yang amat besar itu maka kuching itu tiada-lah bersa pemat dar lelah oleh berkati tuah chinchin itu dan anjing bersa-lah ia pemat dan lelah badan-nya. Maka kata anjing, \"Hai kuching biar-lah aku membawa itu chinchin pula kerana aku tengok kamu segar sahaja.\" Maka kata kuching, \"Kamu tiada boleh bawa ini chinchin. Barang kali jatoh pula sekaran.\" Maka kata anjing, \"Tidak jatoh.\" Maka kata kuching, \"Baik-lah,\" maka diberi-lah kuching itu chinchin kapada anjing, maka di-ambil oleh anjing lalu di-masok-kan-nya kapada mulut-nya. Maka ia pun kuatlah sedikit. Maka lama dengan kalama'an-nya jatoh pula ini chinchin kadalam laut. Maka kata anjing \"Hai kuching, chinchin tuan kita sudah jatoh kadalam laut.\" Maka kata kuching \"Tadi aku sudah kata, jikalau kamu bawa jatoh ini chinchin, maka kata kamu tidak. Sekarang sudah jatoh. Apa-lah hal kita hendak\nmengambil-nya?\" Maka masing-masing bernang-lah lalu sampai ka-pulau singgah-lah kuching dan anjing di-pulau itu.\n\n\"Baik ber-jalan di-t\u00e9pi pantai laut itu, maka dilihat oleh kuching ada sa'ikor ikan terguling di-t\u00e9pi pantai itu, maka fikir kuching, \"Ini-lah ikan besar p\u00e9rut, aku pun lapar boleh-lah aku makan ini ikan.\" Maka kata kuching, \"Hai, anjing, mari-lah kita makan ini. Ada ikan mati boleh kita makan dahulu, k\u00e9rana p\u00e9rut pun sangat lapar-nya.\" Maka t\u00e9-r-lari-lari-lah anjing itu, tiba-tiba lalu ia makan sahaja dan kuching pun makan pula. Maka anjing itu makan pada p\u00e9rut ikan itu, maka t\u00e9mbus ka-dalam-nya maka dilihat oleh anjing ada-lah sab\u00e9ntok chinchin. Maka kata anjing, \"Aku jumpa sab\u00e9ntok chinchin didalam p\u00e9rut ikan ini.\" Maka kata kuching \"Mari aku t\u00e9ngok.\" Maka dib\u00e9ri-kan oleh anjing rupa-nya b\u00e9tul pulak chinchin yang jatoh itu, lalu diambil oleh kuching dimasok-kan-nya ka-dalam mulut-nya.

No information can be had as to its source beyond the fact he learnt it when he was a boy.\u2014G. M. L.]\n\nThere is a story that once in the olden time there lived a man who was called Pa Senik. He had a daughter named Senik and they lived in one house together. Now their occupation was the cultivation of a garden of bananas, and in this garden of theirs they had ever so many kinds. There also lived at this time a man called Awang. This Awang got a friend to go and betroth Pe Senik's daughter. Pa Senik said,\n\n\"If this Awang can give me on account of the expenses of the marriage of my daughter two hundred and fifty banana stems, I will take him as my son-in-law.\"\n\nSo the envoy returned to Awang and told him what Pa Senik had said. Awang replied, \"I can bring as many stems as that.\"\n\nSo the envoy returned once more to Pa Senik and said, \"Awang can bring you the sum that you wish.\"\n\nThen Pa Senik said, \"I accept him. The marriage can take place in three days.\"\n\nSo the man returned to Awang and told him, and Awang said, \"Very well.\" Three days after Pa Senik married his daughter to Awang. But the marriage feast consisted of nothing but all sorts of bananas.\n\nAwang lived happily with his wife. He made a garden of bananas in order that he might be able to pay his marriage expenses.\n\nOne day Awang went out fishing. He got a few. He ordered his wife to make a curry, which she did. Then he invited his father-in-law. So his father-in-law came to dinner. Now it seems that Pa Senik was a little deaf. Awang noticed\nthat his father-in-law sometimes poured the gravy of his curry on his rice and that sometimes he sucked it up. So he said, \"The more gravy the more he sups it up. Yet he is not strong enough to set a fish trap for himself.\"\n\nHis father-in-law said, \"What did you say, Awang?\"\n\n\"I was just thinking that you are most fortunate and that you are indeed skilled in searching for a livelihood. You have no need to pay court to religion.\"\n\n\"What you say is very true indeed.\"\n\nNow the real reason that Awang had invited his father-in-law to dinner was that as long as ever he had lived there next his father-in-law, his father-in-law had never given him a single banana. And yet though he wanted to ask for one, he was ashamed to do so.\n\nSome time later Awang one day went again into the jungle to look for some fish and he found a certain pond which was very deep. By the edge of the pond there was a very big tree. Awang began fishing. He caught quite a lot of fish. At last he had caught as many as he could carry. Then he came home. His father-in-law saw him come home so heavily laden and asked him where he had got the fish. Awang answered, \"I went into the jungle and found a pond which I fished.\"\n\n\"What bait did you use?\"\n\n\"A golden banana which was quite ripe.\"\n\n\"I would like to go and fish to-morrow for I have never yet fished in all my life.\"\n\n\"Very well; but you had better wait a bit till I have cleared the road a bit and it will be easier walking for you.\"\n\nThe next day Awang made a very crooked trail but his own was quite straight. After that his father-in-law set off to go fishing and took with him two whole combs of golden bananas. Awang carefully counted the number of the bananas.\n\nAfter this his father-in-law set off. Awang pointed out the very crooked road but he himself set off on the straight one and reached the pond first. He got into the pond and waited for his father-in-law to arrive. In a little while he turned up. He uncoiled his line and baited it with a golden banana. But Awang snatched his father-in-law's line and\ntook the bait off and ate it. Then his father-in-law lowered the line again and Awang eat the bait once more. And so it went on till there was only about one banana left. Then Awang snatched hold of the line and his father-in-law fell sprawling into the pond. Awang seized him and kept on ducking him under the water and saying,\n\n\"Pa Senik, why don't you give Awang some bananas? If you don't give him some I will really kill you.\"\n\n\"Let me go. And when I get back to the house I will give Awang ever so many bananas.\"\n\nSo Awang let his father-in-law get out and climb upon to the bank and go home. But he (Awang) went home direct and got home first. He sat down at the door of his house and waited for his father-in-law.\n\n\"Well, did you get many fish?\"\n\n\"You have cheated me, Awang.\"\n\n\"How have I cheated you?\"\n\n\"There is a very big evil spirit in that pond. I never got a single fish. But I kept on lowering my bait till it was nearly finished. And then just when I had got to the very last piece, my line was dragged and I fell into the water, and then I was ducked down under the water again and again while he said to me, 'Why don't you give Awang some bananas?' Then I promised to give you some.\"\n\nThen Awang said, \"Had you not better give me them quickly as you have vowed? Otherwise perhaps to-morrow or the day after you may fall ill. You will feel rather stupid later when you are pitied by your children.\"\n\nThen his father-in-law took all sorts of bananas and gave them to Awang. Then he ate them very vulgarly, saying, \"Ahum, ahum, now I've got some one else's bananas.\" His father-in-law said, \"What are you saying, Awang?\"\n\n\"Nothing, Sir. I was only saying that you had made a vow and that Heaven had mercifully spared you.\"\n\n\"Pray for me Awang, pray for me.\"\n\nThen he added, \"Do you want any more bananas, Awang? Eat until you have had quite enough.\"\n\nAnd Awang answered, \"To-morrow I would like some more, sir.\"\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 46, 1906.\nPa Senik.\n\nAlkisah maka ada-lah pada masa zaman dahulu kala, maka ada-lah satu orang nama Pa\u2019Senik, dan ada anak-nya nama Senik perempuan dudok ini orang anak berasanak didalam satu rumah, ada-lah usaha-nya siang dan malam berkubun pisang, maka berbagai-lah bangsa pisang ada kapada-nya. Kemdian ada sa\u2019orang laki-laki nama Awang. Kemdian di suroh oleh Si Awang kapada satu orang pula akan meminang anak Pa\u2019Senik itu; Maka kata Pa\u2019Senik, \u201cJika lalu lalu Si Awang itu membawa-kan belanja anak sahaya itu dengan dua ratus lima puluh perdus pisang boleh sahaya terima.\u201d Kemdian ini orang pun khabar-kan pada Si Awang seperti perkataan Pa\u2019Senik itu. Maka kata Si Awang, \u201cLalu-lah sahaya membawa-kan banyak itu.\u201d Kemdian ini orang balik pula pada Pa\u2019Senik, maka kata orang itu \u201cLalu-lah itu Si Awang membawa belanja sabanyak maksud Pa\u2019Senik.\u201d Maka kata Pa\u2019Senik \u201cSahaya terima-lah, didalam tiga hari ini sahaya boleh nikah-kan.\u201d Kemdian balik-lah ini orang khabar-kan kepada Si Awang. Maka kata Awang \u201cBaik-lah.\u201d Maka didalam tiga hari tu Pa\u2019Senik pun menikah-kan anak-nya dengan Si Awang dan ber-khanduri-lah dengan pelabagai jenis pisang sahaja. Maka dudok-lah Si Awang bersuka suka-an dengan perempuan-nya serta ia membuat kebun pisang akan membayar belanja perempuan-nya. Kemdian ada satu hari pergi-lah ini Si Awang mencari ikan dapat-lah kadar sedikit-sedikit, maka disuroh oleh Si Awang gulai itu ikan kepada perempuan-nya, maka digulai-lah oleh perempuan-nya. Maka diajak oleh Si Awang mertua-nya makan bersama-sama. Maka makan-lah mertua-nya itu bersama-sama Si Awang. Maka ada-lah mertua-nya p\u00e8kak-p\u00e8kak bahasa sedikit, maka di-dalam tengah makan itu dilihat oleh Si Awang ini mertua-nya terkadang dituang-nya kuah gulai kadalam nasi-nya dan terkadang dihirup-nya. Maka kata Si Awang, \u201cTuan ini lagi b\u00e9rkuah lagi b\u00e9rhirup, menahan bubu tidak kuasa.\u201d Maka kata mertua-nya itu, \u201cApa kata kamu Awang?\u201d Maka jawab Si Awang \u201cSahaya terkenang-kan tuan itu lagi b\u00e9rtuah lagi pandai b\u00e9rhidup m\u00e9nuntut almu tidak kuasa.\u201d Maka kata mertua-nya \u201cB\u00e9nar sekali-lah kata anak-ku itu.\u201d Maka ada-lah sebab diajak oleh Si Awang\nmentua-nya itu makan ber-sama-sama kerana beberapa lama sudah ini Si Awang dudok ber-sama-sama di situ belum pernah ini mentua-nya itu membiri sabiji pisang kepada Si Awang ini dan Si Awang hendak mintak kapada mentua-nya itu ia malu. Kemdian ada-lah satu hari yang lain pergi pula menchari ikan masok ia kadalan hutan maka berjumpa-lah ia dengan sabuah kolam sangat dalam-nya dan ditepi kolam itu ada sapoko kayu besar. Maka mengail-lah itu Si Awang didalam kolam itu. Maka banyak-lah Si Awang dapat ikan hingga sarat ia membawa ikan itu. Kemdian ia pun balik, maka dilihat oleh mentua Si Awang itu Si Awang sarat membawa ikan, maka kata-nya \"Dimana kamu dapat ikan itu Awang?\" Maka jawab Si Awang \"Sahaya masok ka-dalam hutan berjumpa sabuah kolam di situ-lah sahaya mengail. Maka kata mentua-nya \"Api kamu umpan-kan Awang?\" Maka kata Si Awang, \"Pisang amas yang masak-masak.\" Maka kata mentua Si Awang, \"Esok aku hendak merasa mengail kerana sa'omar hidop aku ini belum pernah aku mengail.\" Maka jawab Si Awang, \"Baik tetapi nanti dahulu sahaya terangkan jalan baik supaya senang tuan berjalan.\" Kemdian esok hari-nya Si Awang buat-lah satu jalan yang sangat bengkok-nya dan ia punya jalan elok betul. Habis itu ini mentua-nya pun hendak pergi mengail itu di bawa-nya pisang amas dua sikat. Maka ini pisang dibilang Si Awang banyak sedikit-nya. Habis itu mentua-nya pun berjalan ditunjok-kan-nya pada jalan yang bengkok-bengkok itu dan dia ikut jalan yang betul. Maka dahulu-lah sampai Si Awang pada kolam itu. Maka terjun-lah Si Awang masok kadalam kolam itu menanti mentua-nya. Sabentar lagi tiba-lah mentua-nya itu serta mengulur kail-nya dan diumpan-kan-nya dengan pisang amas. Maka ditangkap oleh Si Awang kail mentua-nya itu di-ambil-nya umpan-nya itu lalu di-makan-nya. Kemdian di-hulor juga oleh mentua-nya dan di-makan-nya juga demikian selalu bagitu juga. Ada-lah kira-kira tinggal satu biji pisang, maka di-hulor juga oleh mentua-nya maka di-tangkap oleh Si Awang kail mentua-nya serta ditarek-kan-nya kail itu ka-dalam ayer. Maka tersungkur-lah mentua-nya masok ka-dalam kolam itu lalu di-tekan tekan-nya mentua-nya di-dalam ayer itu serta kata, \"Mengapa kamu, Pa'Senik, tidak bagi Si Awang makan pisang? Jikalau tidak kamu bagi Si\nAwang makan pisang tentu kamu aku bunoh.\" Maka jawab m\u011bntua-nya \"L\u011bpas-kan-lah aku; tiba aku ka-rumah boleh aku bagi Si Awang makan pisang banyak-banyak.\" Maka sudah itu di-l\u011bpas-kan-nya-lah m\u011bntua-nya lalu ia naik kadarat lang-song ia balik ka-rumah-nya. Dan Si Awang pun balik ia dahulu dudok ia di-muka pintu dan m\u011bntua-nya tiba k\u011bmdian. Maka kata Si Awang \"Banyak-kah tuan dapat ikan?\" Maka jawab m\u011bntua-nya \"Kamu tipu aku rupa-nya Awang.\" Maka kata Awang \"Apa sahaya tipu kapada tuan?\" Maka kata m\u011bntua-nya, \"Itu kolam sangat besar hantu-nya, sa'ekor ikan pun tidak aku dapat, di-hulur-hulur habis umpan-nya, maka pada umpan yang pengabis ditar\u011bk-nya kail aku dan aku pun t\u011br-jatoh ka-dalam ayer lalu dit\u011bkan t\u011bkan-nya aku s\u011brta kata-nya, 'M\u011bngapa tidak kamu bagi Si Awang makan pisang? Maka jikalau tidak dibagi, kamu aku bunoh.' Maka aku pun m\u011bngaku-lah m\u011bmb\u011bri kamu makan pisang.\" Maka kata Si Awang \"Tuan baik s\u011bg\u011bra-kan s\u011bp\u011brti nazar tuan itu esok lusa \u011bntah-kan tuan sakit pula jadi s\u011bsal b\u011bbal pulak anak.\" Maka m\u011bntua-nya m\u011bngambil pisang macham-macham j\u011bnis dib\u011bri-kan-nya kapada Si Awang, maka Si Awang pun makan-lah s\u011brta ber-s\u011bdawa kata-nya \"Ahah-ham paku; pisang orang, pisang aku\" Maka kata m\u011bntua-nya itu, \"Apa kata kamu Awang?\" \"Tidak apa, tuan: kata sahaja tuan b\u011brnazar sama sahaya dil\u011bpas-kan Allah m\u011bntua sahaya.\" Maka kata m\u011bntua-nya \"Doa-kan-lah Awang kapada aku.\" S\u011brta kata-nya \"Hendakkah lagi pisang, Awang? Makan-lah puas-puasam.\" Maka jawab Awang \"Esok-esok pula tuan.\"\nERRATA.\n\nThe MSS of the two articles entitled the Baboon Pak Si Bagok and the Girl,\" and \"A Pelandok Tale\" having been given inadvertently to the printers before being finally edited, the following alterations should be noted, viz:\u2014\n\nFor Pa Si Bagok read Pak Si Bagok throughout.\nFor Tok Allang tree read toalang tree throughout.\nFor roe deer read barking deer throughout.\nFor deer read sambhur deer throughout.\np. 79, l. 11. for hands read hams.\np. 75, l. 11. for nothin read nothing.\np. 75, l. 12. for thee read the.\np. 75, l. 27. for shout read snout.\n\nOmit the foot note on p. 65 and observe that many words on pp. 68 to 71 that begin with capital letters should be in ordinary type merely.\nThe Baboon Pa Si Bagok and the Girl.\n\nBy G. M. Laidlaw.\n\nAn earlier story by Penghulu Mat Nordin refers to this big baboon. But this is the only other story of Pa Si Bagok that I can find. No further information or additional stories can be had. Nor can the story teller give any history of the tale. It has nothing to do with Hanuman (\"Handoman.\") Once upon a time there was a certain poor man and his wife who lived in a clearing in the jungle. Now these two had a daughter. Every day the husband and his wife went off to their clearing and left their daughter alone in the house. One day while they were away a big baboon found this girl. When she saw him she was very frightened and all her joints and bones shivered because of her fear of the baboon. But she disguised her feelings by talking. The baboon on his part fell deeply in love with the girl and wished to make her his wife. The girl said, \"How are you so wet, Pa Si Bagok?\"\n\n\"I have just been fishing with a casting net.\"\n\n\"If you have been fishing, where is your casting net?\"\n\n\"I left in a terap tree. If I left it there nobody will know.\"\n\n\"But if you have been fishing, where are the fish?\"\n\n\"I left them in the river, so that nobody should know.\"\n\n\"Why is your head so flat?\"\n\n\"Because I wear an Arab cap every day.\"\n\n\"Where is your cap?\"\n\n\"I left it in the house.\"\n\n\"Why are your fingers so bent?\"\n\n\"Because I hold a pen every day.\"\n\n[Note.\u2014A great many common nouns in the Malay are improperly typed with a capital].\n\nJour. S. B. R. A. Soc., No. 46, 1906.\n\"If you use a pen every day where is it?\"\n\"I left it in my box. If I left it in the box no one will know.\"\n\"Why do you sit like that, Pa Si Bagok?\"\n\"Because I am used to sitting on a mat every day.\"\n\"If you do so, where is the mat?\"\n\"The mat is in a princess' house where nobody knows.\"\n\nAfter that the baboon carried her away to the top of a Tok Allang tree. The girl cried. After the girl had been carried away by the baboon her father and mother came back from their clearing and found that their daughter had disappeared. They too wept.\n\n\"Alas my daughter, where can you have gone to? Who can have carried you off? What evil spirit, what jin, can have had the heart to carry you away?\"\n\nBoth her father and her mother were very very sorry that their daughter had disappeared.\n\nThe baboon made a small hut on the top of the Tok Allang tree for his wife. Every day he went to find food and water for her and also to find clothes. After a time the girl became pregnant and bore a son. The child was half man and half baboon. Two months after this the girl thought of a plan by which she could escape back to her father and mother. So she ordered Pa Si Bagok to look for a joint of the b\u00ebtong bamboo.\n\nHe said, \"What are you going to use it for?\"\n\"I want to bathe our child. Just think for what a long time it has never been bathed.\"\n\nPa Si Bagok thought that this was all right so he went to look for a b\u00ebtong bamboo and in a short time he found one. So he came back with a joint. Then his wife took it gently and made a hole in the bottom. Then she said.\n\n\"Pa Si Bagok, go and fill the bamboo full of water. If it is not quite full it won't do.\"\n\nSo Pa Si Bagok took the bamboo and went to a place where the water was beautiful and clear, and filled the bamboo there. Then he went away for a moment. When he came back he saw that it was no longer full. Then he filled it to\n\nJour, Straits Branch\nthe brim and went away again. But the water leaked again. And so it went on all day till evening. While Pa Si Bagok was away getting the water his wife took her child\u2019s cradle which was made of tgrap bark and lengthened it till it reached to the ground. Then she climbed down to the ground and ran away with her child to the villages. At last she reached a house by the edge of a clearing and asked where the house of her parents was. She ran off again as soon as she was told for she was afraid that Pa Si Bagok was behind her. In a little while she reached her home. Her parents were extremely glad to see their daughter with her child, half monkey, half man. Then they thought, \u201cWhat are we to do? For she is sure to be followed by this baboon. We had better make some magic.\u201d So they made a very deep hole and placed some banana stems at the bottom.\n\nHe said, \u201cIf that baboon comes now, I will tell him that his wife and child have died and that this is their grave.\u201d\n\nAt last when Pa Si Bagok was tired out and had not been able to fill the bamboo, and it was nearly nightfall, he thought, \u201cI had better go back and ask my wife what she means.\u201d So he returned to the Tok Allang tree. But when he got there he found that his wife and child had disappeared. He was very grieved, but as it was night he could do nothing. He got no sleep all that night. At daybreak he started off in a great hurry. He met a man and asked him about his wife and child. \u201cHai sir, have you noticed a woman carrying a child pass this way?\u201d The man replied that he had not.\n\nTo every person that he met he put the same question. At last he reached her parents\u2019 house. There he asked her father, \u201cHas your daughter come back bringing her child with her?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe did: but they have both died.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat has happened that both of them have died?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe travelled too fast. For she was afraid of you. She thought that if you found her you would kill her. So she was quite worn out and both of them have died.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they are dead where is the grave?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome and let us go and see it.\u201d\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 46, 1906.\nNow the girl's father had made an arrangement with three or four men when he made the grave that if they got the baboon in it, it was to be filled in again from the top.\n\nWhen Pa Si Bagok reached the grave he began to dig it up. Now these other men were waiting on the top, and when Pa Si Bagok was right down into the hole they filled in again from the top. And so Pa Si Bagok died.\n\nTHE END.\n\nMaka ada-lah suatu zaman dahulu kala satu k\u0115lamin Orang miskin dudok-lah ia Laki Bini-nya pada satu t\u0115mpat p\u0115r-buata Ladang d\u0115ngan satu buah Rumah k\u0115chil, Maka ada-lah ia sa-Orang anak-nya P\u0115r\u0115mpuan, Maka pada tiap-tiap hari ini miskin p\u0115rgi-lah ia Laki Bini-nya b\u0115r-kerja Ladang dan tinggal-lah anak-nya di-Rumah satu Orang diri-nya.

A. Soc., No. 46, 1906.\nA Pelandok Tale.\n\nBy G. M. LAIDLAW.\n\n[From the penghulu of Pulau Tiga, Lower Perak, Haji Mahomed Ali bin Haji Mahomed Perak. No details of the source can be obtained. The teller is so far as his ancestry can be traced for several generations of pure Perak extraction].\n\nThis is the tale of the pelandok, this is a four footed animal that lives in the woods and is very small, just about the size of a cat. Now in the olden days this animal was very much cleverer than all the others. Also in those days animals could talk.\n\nWe must farther explain that in those days, the king of all the animals was King Solomon. His form was the form of a man, but his appearance and dress was that of one of the wild men of the woods, the Sakai. His chief warrior (Hulubalang) was the tiger and his chief counsellor (Penghulu) was the pelandok.\n\nOnce upon a day, they say, the pelandok was walking along looking for his food, when he met with a doe. The pelandok said, \"Hai, Sang Rusa, what is the name of the tree you are eating?\"\n\nThe deer replied, \"I am eating the young shoots of the yam.\"\n\nThe deer then said to the pelandok, \"Where have you come from, Toh Sang Dirimba?\"\n\nThe pelandok said, \"I have come from my house and am also looking for my food.\"\n\nNow when the pelandok saw that the deer was very fat indeed, the thought came into his heart and he desired to eat her. So he went off to the tiger. When he reached him the tiger said, \"Where have you come from, Toh Sang Dirimba?\"\n\nThe pelandok answered, \"I have come from Sang Rusa over there, and have come straight to find you, Hulubalang, for I want to eat that doe.\"\n\nJour. S. B. R. A. Soc., No. 46, 1906.\nThe tiger said, \"How ever are you going to eat her?\"\nThe pelandok replied, \"That is why I have come to find you, in order that we may lay our plans together.\"\nThe tiger said, \"What are your plans?\"\nThe pelandok said, \"You, hulubalang, must pretend to be dead, and lie down with your mouth wide open and your body covered with flies. When you are ready, I will call together the deer and the elephant and the rhinoceros and the roe deer and the pig. As soon as we have got them all together, I will give them each their work. But you are to do nothing but listen to whatever I say in my mourning. You are to do nothing when we give you your funeral bath or when we are on the road. But when I call out, 'Yam yam' that is the time when you are to catch Sang Rusa.\"\nThe tiger answered, \"Very well then.\"\nThe story about the tiger goes on to say that after he had made this plot with the pelandok, he pretended to be dead lying down with open mouth covered with flies. Also he did not breathe through his nostrils but only through his mouth. After he was ready the pelandok went away to get the elephant, the rhinoceros, the deer, the pig, and the roe deer. This was how he called them,\n\"Hai, Sang Elephant, Sang Rhinoceros, Sang Deer, Sang Pig, Sang Roe-deer, King Solomon has ordered you all to be summoned together in order that you may bury his Hulubalang Dirimba, who died last night. Come at once.\"\nSo all these animals followed behind the pelandok who led them to the place where the tiger was. When they had all got there, the pelandok ordered Sang Pig to dig a hole and the elephant to bring water, and the deer to hold the tiger's head on her lap, and also the upper part of the body, and the roe deer was told to hold the body from the waist to the tail, and the rhinoceros was told to make a smooth road. When the preparations were all finished the pelandok told them to bear the body to the hole. He ordered the deer to lift up the head and the elephant to support the body. But the roe deer and the pig began to bicker. The roe deer said,\n\"Let me carry the tail.\"\nThe pig said, \"Let me go first and show the way. Because from the colour of his fur, it looks as if he were alive.\"\nThe roe deer said, \"I also am not very easy in my mind.\"\nThe pelandok then said, \"Don't talk too much there.\"\nSo three of them, the deer and the elephant and the rhinoceros bore the body along. The pelandok then got on the top of an ant heap and began to lament for the tiger in this wise.\n\n\"Ho Toh Hulubalang, who achievest the desires of my heart, yam yam.\"\n\nThe roe deer said, \"Listen Sang Babi, what a shrill cry Sang Dirimba is making. What is he saying?\"\n\nWhile the roe deer was in the act of saying this to the pig, the tiger seized hold of the deer by the back of her neck, and dragged her down. The elephant rushed off trumpeting as he went. The rhinoceros darted off screaming. The roe deer darted off like a bullet springing three fathoms at a time. The pig followed. When the pelandok heard the uproar in the forest and all the animals running away, he said, \"Spring, Sang Roedeer. Sang Deer's case is decided.\"\n\nAfter he had said that the pig drove his snout with a bang against the projecting buttress of a merbau stem. The pelandok heard it and also the scream that the pig gave in its pain. The pelandok said,\n\n\"Mind the buttress, Sang Pig. Sang Deer's case is over.\"\n\nThe pig replied,\n\n\"Let your own father mind the buttress Sang Dirimba. I am sore all over and you do nothin' but laugh.\"\n\nAnd that is why the pig's shout is flat to this day. Then all the animals ran right away.\n\nThe story of the deer that was taken by the tiger goes on to say that after they had finished their plot they divided the deer into two: one half for the tiger and one half for the pelandok. They then carried the meat off to a place where some men had been making a clearing. The wood had nearly all been felled. They took wood and made a place on which they could smoke the meat. They also took some more fire wood. When it was all ready and the meat had been placed in\nposition they lit the fire. By that time it was night. About midnight when one side of the meat had been cooked they turned it over to the other side. When this had been done the pelandok said,\n\n\"Hai, hulubalang, let me go to sleep now and then when I wake up you can have a nap.\"\n\nThe tiger said, \"Very good.\" \"But,\" added the pelandok, \"Don't you interfere with my eye teeth for fear that you should be hurt by their poison.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\n\"Then again,\" said the pelandok, \"whenever my eyes are closed I am not asleep, but if my eyes wink and if I snore at the same time, then I am asleep.\"\n\nAfter this the pelandok went to sleep. The tiger put more wood on the fire. After about an hour's sleep the pelandok began to wink his eyes and to snore. The tiger began to think about the pelandok's eye teeth.\n\n\"Are they really poisonous or are they not?\"\n\nSo the tiger began to touch them.\n\n\"They are not so very sharp,\" he said.\n\nAfter gazing closely at them for a little while he lay down. Now the pelandok had seen him touching them. After that the pelandok, thinking that smoking was now properly done, got up from his sleep.\n\nWhen the pelandok got up the tiger went to sleep and began to snore too. When the pelandok saw that the tiger was fast asleep he took the tiger's share and ate it up. Then he took a piece of the bark of the gentong tree, which was of the same shape and put it where the tiger's meat had been. This was now near day-break. When the sun rose the pelandok called the tiger who rose from his sleep with a start. When he had got up the pelandok said,\n\n\"Hai, hulubalang, come along to this clearing and find a stick on which we can carry this cooked meat.\"\n\nSo they both set off together. When they were about half way there, the pelandok said,\n\n\"Hai, hulubalang, you look for the root (with which to tie it on), while I look for the stick on which to carry it.\"\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nWhile the tiger was looking for the root, the pelandok took the stem of a Satamban tahi which had been felled by the men in the clearing. Now the thorns of this are quite long, about an inch long each. Those thorns that were near the foot of the stem he did not remove, but those that were near the top he did. After that the pelandok and the tiger each took up their share. The tiger put his share in front of himself and the pelandok put his share in front of himself. Then they set off towards the river. As they walked on each began to eat. While they were walking along the tiger said, \"Oh dear, I am very sore, this stick is pricking my back. Also my meat is very bitter.\"\n\nThe pelandok answered and said,\n\n\"That, hulubalang, is what I told you last night. I warned you not to interfere with my eye teeth. Now your meat has become bitter.\"\n\nThe tiger said, \"Hai, Sang Dirimba, give me a little of your meat, just to taste. Because I am very tired, everything seems difficult for me.\"\n\nWhen the pelandok heard that, he took pity on the tiger and gave him a little. This tasted extremely delicious to the tiger, who stopped in the middle of the road. The pelandok said, \"What is the matter? Why are you stopping? We are certainly near a big river now. And if we are late in arriving and we meet with his highness King Solomon he is sure to take away this meat from us. Moreover he will be angry with us and punish us because we have devoured this deer without letting him know.\"\n\nWhen the tiger heard that he took up his stick again. A little farther on, just about as far as you can hear a cry in the woods, they reached the bank of the river. There they stopped and each devoured his meat. The share of the pelandok was quite finished because he four times gave the tiger a piece. After that they each had a drink, but the tiger's share was left unfinished on the bank.\n\nThey tried to get across the river. The tiger and the pelandok set off together down stream, skirting the edge. They found a raft made of banana stems which had got stranded\non a big trunk that had fallen down by the edge of the river. They both got on board the raft and shoved it off across. It was the tiger that did the shoving, the pelandok did nothing. When they got near to the bank, the pelandok sprang on shore and left the tiger on the raft drifting down stream. The pelandok said, \"Hai hulubalang, you will die now when you are caught by the crocodiles. I finished that smoked meat of yours last night, and put some gentong bark in its place.\"\n\nThe tiger became angry and said, \"Just you wait, Sang Dirimba, and I'll eat you.\" He then sprang on to the bank began looking for the pelandok. But the pelandok had and walked on. In a short while the pelandok came across a hornets' nest in some lalang and sat down near it. When it was nearly evening the tiger met him there and said to him, \"Now I have found you, I will eat you. You cheated medid you?\"\n\nThe pelandok said, \"Dont eat me, for I have been ordered by King Solomon to look after his gong, Don't you see it?\"\n\n\"Where is it?\"\n\"This: listen to it humming.\"\n\"May I strike it?\"\n\"Don't. Are n't you afraid of King Solomon?\"\n\"Let me strike it: just a little.\"\n\"Wait then till I go and lay your request before King Solomon?\"\n\nAfter that the pelandok ran away from the place where the nest was as far as his voice could be heard. Then he shouted out, \"Hit it, hulubalang.\"\n\nWhen the tiger heard that he lifted his paw and struck it. Then the hornets swarmed out over the tiger, who ran away roaring and with his body and his face all swollen.\n\nWhen the pelandok heard the tiger roaring like that he ran away for a long distance. When night fell he stopped by a large tree trunk and nestled in between the buttresses round the stem. He was quite frightened of the tiger since he had been guilty of cheating him so many times. He got no sleep that night for he wanted to find some other stratagem by which he could again punish the tiger. All that night he pondered.\nThe next day he set off again and travelled till about midday, then he came across a big python which was fast asleep snoring. It lay sleeping with its body in three coils but its head was some way off in the middle of the main road. When the pelandok saw that the snake was obviously fast asleep, he sat down near the coil, because he thought that if the tiger were to come he could once more quibble with him and say that he was watching King Solomon\u2019s waist belt. So he sat there till about the middle of the afternoon when the tiger once more met him. When the tiger saw the pelandak sitting squatted on his hands he became very angry indeed and intended to spring on the pelandok. But the pelandok saw the tiger about to spring on him and said, \u201cHai, hulubalang, don\u2019t spring on me, because I am watching King Solomon\u2019s belt. He has ordered me to do so because this is a valuable ancestral cloth. This is what he is going to wear in state to-morrow. For the king has given orders that we are to be summoned in a couple of days when he is going to make a proclamation.\u201d\n\nThe tiger gave up trying to catch him because he saw that the cloth was very beautiful and also that the colour was of mingled gold. He was very much surprised and very much desired to feel what it was like to put it on, so he said, \u201cHai, Toh Sang Dirimba, may I put it on?\u201d\n\n\u201cWait until I go and ask King Solomon.\u201d\n\nSo the pelandok walked on until he came to an ant heap into the top of which he claimed. Then he shouted out to the tiger, \u201cHai hulubalang, put it on.\u201d\n\nWhen the tiger heard that he put it on. The tiger saw that the snake moved so he thought, \u201cThis thing seems to be afraid of me, I seem to have been cheated.\u201d\n\nSo the tiger took a stick and beat the snake. When he hit it it crawled away. The tiger was very much astonished that the pelandok should have cheated him once more and became more angry than ever. So he began to search for the pelandok again. But the pelandok had run away very far indeed, and the tiger could not find him.\n\nThe pelandok came to a large river. When he got to the bank he saw a tree called Chadong. The fruit of this tree\nis about as large as a cat's eye, and when it is ripe it is sweet. Now the pelandok was very fond of eating this fruit. But he did not know how to get across the river for the current was swift and the water deep. He saw that there were a lot of crocodiles in the river. So he went to look for a cocoanut shell and when he had got one he held it in his hand and went and stood on the bank of the river and called to all the crocodiles like this, \"Hai, all you Si Rangkaks, come together here for King Solomon has ordered me to make a census of you.\"\n\nWhen the crocodiles heard that they all came to the top of the water. Then the pelandok ordered them to arrange themselves in a line right across the river. When they had put themselves in position the pelandok got on to the head of the first crocodile and then struck the head of the crocodile with the cocoanut shell saying, \"One two three,\" (crick), \"small head big head\" (crack) \"One two three,\" (crick), \"small head big head\" (crack).\n\nAnd so on until he had got across the river. Then he got up the bank and said, \"Hai, all you Si Rangkaks, I wanted to get across this river to eat this chadong fruit, so I said that King Solomon had ordered you all to float. Now I have knocked all your heads with this coconut, aren't you clever you stupids?\"\n\nWhen the crocodiles heard that they were very angry with him, and said, \"It will be impossible for you to drink any water now, for if you drink the water of this river or of any other we will catch you.\"\n\n\"I can go away from the river, to the swamps and the ponds and the buffalo wallows and the puddles, what is to stop me?\"\n\n\"Wherever there is water, we will be there. Don't you make any mistake about that.\"\n\n\"Hai, is that so? If you are clever you will catch me, but if I am clever I will not die.\"\n\nThen the pelandok began to eat the chadong fruit. But the crocodiles had a council together, those from the sea and from the river and from the swamp. They all laid themselves in wait for him. The pelandok went on eating the chadong\nfruit until he was satiated. Then he became very thirsty and wanted a drink of water. So he went to the swamp and the wallows and called out like this, \"Hai, Si Rangkak.\"\n\nAnd the crocodiles answered, \"Yoo-ee.\"\n\nSo the pelandok stopped and went to the river. There again he called out. This time four crocodiles answered him.\n\n\"Hai,\" said the pelandok, \"If it is this sort of thing, I will die for I will not be able to drink.\"\n\nSo he went right up stream and called out once more. This time ten answered him. Then the pelandok noticed that a big bamboo, a buloh aur, had fallen down from the midst of a clump into the water. So he crept along the stem among the thickest leaves till he was able to get a drink. While he was lapping up the water, making a noise, chepak chepak, a crocodile made a snatch at him from below but only caught hold of the branch of the bamboo. The pelandok was alarmed and called out,\n\n\"Adohai, adohai, not so strong, hai Si Rangkak.\"\n\n\"Don't talk about its being strong; you are going to die this time.\"\n\n\"Hai,\" said the pelandok while he crept slowly back along the stem, \"Don't tear me like that.\"\n\nSo the crocodile dragged at the bamboo till he threshed the water into big waves. But the pelandok had got safely to shore.\n\nThen the pelandok said, \"Hai, Si Rangkak, what is the use of your catching hold of that tough bamboo? I am very sorry for you, you hoped that you had caught hold of me.\"\n\nWhen the crocodile heard that he let go of the bamboo. The pelandok went on looking for an ant heap because he wanted to sleep, for he had eaten till he was satisfied and also he was very tired. He was afraid too of the tiger that he had cheated. At last he found a small pointed one on to the top of which he climbed and went fast asleep, snoring.\n\nAll this time the tiger had been looking for the pelandok. At last he reached a river where he found a large crocodile floating. The crocodile spoke to him, \"Hai hulubalang, where have you come from?\"\nI have come from the big jungle where I have been looking for the pelandok, who has deceived me so badly that I want to kill him; first he diddled me with a hornets' nest that left me full of stings, then he gave me a very nasty moment just now with a big snake but fortunately I saw that it was alive. So I am looking for him to eat him.\"\n\nWhen the crocodile heard that he in his turn told how the pelandok had cheated him, and how when the pelandok wanted to eat the chadong fruit he had told them that King Solomon had ordered a census to be made and had ordered them to arrange themselves side by side right across the river, and then when they were arranged how he took a coconut and rapped them all on the head saying, \"One two three\" (crick) \"small head, big head\" (crack) until he had rapped them all on the head. And then as soon as he had got across he told them how he had cheated them. And so they too were very angry with the pelandok.\n\nWhen the tiger heard the story of the crocodile he said to the crocodile, \"We had better lay our plans together; you can carry me across to the other bank over there and I can hunt for him. If he runs into the water he is your meat but if I catch him on the land he is mine.\"\n\nThe crocodile agreed, so the tiger got on to his head and was carried across the river and safely reached the other bank.\n\nNow at the time that the tiger and the crocodile were making this plot the pelandok heard them from the top of the bank that was exactly opposite. The pelandok's thoughts ran thus:\n\n\"I had better kill the tiger now, because he has promised that if I run into the water I am the crocodile's meat but that if he catches me on the land I am his. Ah, I know what to do.\"\n\nWhen the tiger got safely to land he began to look for the pelandok. Now the pelandok went and stood in the middle of a small clearing where there was very little brushwood. The tiger sprang out on the pelandok saying,\n\n\"Now this time I have got you, Sang Dirimba, and I will eat you\n\nJour, Straits Branch\n\"Try then, make your effort. If you are really the great warrior of the woods, you will get me now. But I think that I will turn you out.\"\n\nWhen the tiger heard that, he sprang on the pelandok, but the pelandok ran off close to the edge of the bank. The tiger chased him. Then he sprang back inland. Now when the crocodiles heard the uproar on the bank made by the tiger chasing the pelandok, they all gathered together and watched the edge of the water. The tiger made another spring at the pelandok but did not get him, for the pelandok jumped off to the edge of the bank. The pelandok twisted and turned, bounding ten feet at a time. Now at one part of the bank there was a sandy beach. The pelandok sprang to the edge of the beach and dipped his foot in the water, and then sprang back to the land. The tiger followed him to the water's edge but overjumped himself and sprang about twelve feet into the water. Then the crocodiles seized him thinking that he was the pelandok. The tiger struggled in his pain. When the crocodiles had hold of him they tore him.\n\nThe tiger said, \"Friends, don't tear me.\"\n\nThe crocodiles said, \"We don't care; the promise that we made before was that whatever came into the water was our meat.\"\n\nWhen the tiger heard that he burst out crying and at last died. The pelandok rejoiced and said, \"Tear him Si Rangkak, eat him. He is bigger than I. What is the use of a thing like me? You would hardly be able to taste me.\"\n\nThis is the fealty of the crocodile. Don't have anything to do with it.\n\nAfter escaping from this peril the pelandok went on his way towards the garden where King Solomon lived. He passed close to one house in a garden where he heard some men quarrelling about an axe. One man had borrowed an axe from another for a long time for over a year, and had not returned it. When the owner wanted it the man who had borrowed it said that it had been eaten by weevils. So the two men had gone to law before the king. When they got\nthere the owner made his petition to the king. The king then examined the borrower who answered, \"Yes, your highness. I have borrowed it but the axe head has been quite devoured by weevils. And the owner won't allow that it is lost: he wants it.\"\n\nThe king was puzzled for it was not right that an axe head should be eaten by weevils. So he said, \"Hai there you dog, go and call Selang Dirimba, for you know where he is, the others do not know where he lives.\"\n\nSo the dog travelled for half a day until he met the pelandok. Then he said, \"Hai, Selang Dirimba, his highness King Solomon calls you.\"\n\nWhen the pelandok heard what the dog said he at once went to King Solomon's house. When he got there he went up into the house.\n\n\"Selang Dirimba.\"\n\"Your highness.\"\n\"I have sent for you because these men, these two, have been disputing about an axe head. One man is the owner and the other has borrowed it. The borrower says that the axe head is eaten by weevils, but the other will not allow this. So I don't know what to think and I have asked you to decide the case.\"\n\n\"What you say is very true your highness, will you first allow your slave to go away and bathe?\"\n\nSo the pelandok went away to bathe at the river bank. Then he went off to a patch of lalang grass that had been burnt near the king's garden, there he rolled over and over in the ashes till his body was black. Then he went back to the king's house. It had now become evening. The king saw that the pelandok's body had been blackened by the lalang ashes so he said, \"What has happened Toh Selang Dirimba to make your body so black? You said that you wanted to bathe. What kind of bathing is this?\"\n\n\"Pardon, your majesty is always correct. Your slave went away just now to bathe, but your slave saw that the sea near your majesty's garden was all ablaze, so your slave went to help to put it out, and when he had put it out your\nslave came back. That is why his body is black: it had been singed by the fire.\"\n\nWhen the king heard that he was most astonished and said, \"Hai, it seems to me to be most improbable that the sea should be on fire.\"\n\nBoth the suitors too heard this. The pelandok said, \"Why does your highness not believe me?\" The king leant back in astonishment and said, \"Why Selang Dirimba, it is most improbable as far as my knowledge goes, for I have never heard that anything like this happened in former times.\"\n\nThe borrower of the axe still more strongly said that it was improbable. Then the pelandok said, \"Pardon your majesty, a thousand thousand pardons, but that is just why so far as your slave's knowledge goes it seems so improbable to him that the axe head was eaten by the weevils, for he has never heard that that has happened in former times.\"\n\nWhen the king heard what the pelandok said he at once gave his decision against the borrower and ordered him to either return the axe or to replace it with one as good.\n\nAfter the case had been decided the pelandok got leave to go home again. So he set off. On his way he passed by a fruit garden where he wanted to look for some durians, but he met a tiger there. The tiger spoke to him saying, \"Hai Selang Dirimba, where have you come from?\"\n\n\"I have just come from the king's house where the case of two men who were quarrelling about an axe that the one had lent and the other had borrowed has just been decided. The case is over now.\"\n\nAfter they had talked about that, the tiger said to the pelandok, \"Last night I dreamt that I was eating a black he goat. What do you think, Selang Dirimba, ought I to go and look for this goat? Should I believe this or not?\"\n\nThe pelandok said, \"Don't go and look for the goat. Go and get King Solomon to decide the case. It will be quite easy for you, because King Solomon has just sent for that goat.\"\n\nWhen the tiger heard what the pelandok said he set off to King Solomon's house. When he got there the king addressed him,\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 46, 1906.\n\"Where have you come from, great warrior of the woods?\n\"Your highness, your slave has come from his house because he wished to come into your most royal presence.\"\n\"For what reason?\"\n\"Your slave wished to explain to your majesty that one night he dreamt that he was eating a black goat and he wishes to know what he ought to do.\"\n\"Hai, I have never yet eaten a black he goat and yet you have dreamt of doing so.\"\n\nSo the king called his dog and told him to go and call Selang Dirimba and the dog went and looked for him till he was tired but could not find him. Now when the tiger had gone to King Solomon's house, Selang Dirimba had gone to find a black he goat that lived in a village near to the king. When he found him he said to him, \"Hai, black goat, you had better take care for the tiger wants to eat you. He was pleased to tell me of a dream he had a little while ago, he said, 'I dreamt that I was eating a black goat last night, Selang Dirimba; what does my dream mean?' I answered and said, 'I do not know: you should go to King Solomon and get him to explain it.' So after that the tiger went away to the king's house. Now what do you think, are you frightened or not?\"\n\n\"Hai, Toh Selang Dirimba, what do you advise me to do?\"\n\n\"You had better at once make a torch from a coconut leaf, for the king may call me at any moment.\"\n\nWhen the goat heard what the pelandok said, he at once took a coconut leaf and made a torch. Then the pelandok said, \"You go on in front to the king's house and lurk in the brushwood close to the house, and when I call you, come up into the house.\"\n\nSo the goat went and lurked in the brushwood by the king's house. When he had gone the dog came and gave Selang Dirimba an order like this, \"Hai Selang Dirimba, King Solomon calls you at once.\"\n\nWhen the pelandok heard what the dog said he went off with him to the king's house. When he reached the king's house the king called out, \"I have called you Selang Dirimba\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nbecause a tiger has told me that he dreamt one night that he was eating a black goat. Now what do you think this dream forebodes?\"\n\n\"Pardon your majesty, a thousand thousand be thy slave's pardons, if it commends itself to your gracious majesty might it not be as well to call this goat?\"\n\nAfter the pelandok had said this the king ordered the dog to call the goat. Now the goat heard the king's order that he was to be called so he came out. When the dog came he saw him and called out to him, \"Hai Sang Goat, his highness calls you.\"\n\nSo the goat went into the house and left his torch below on the ground. When he arrived the king began to examine him: \"I have called you Sang Goat, because this hulubalang dreamt a night ago that he was eating you. What do you think of that?\"\n\n\"Pardon your majesty, a thousand thousand pardons your most gracious majesty, your highness can better judge what ought to be done, but if the decision is left to me I do not like that dream for it seems that in it I die.\"\n\n\"What you say is very true, but all the same my judgment is that whenever a man dreams of eating he should eat and that whenever a man dreams of wearing anything he should put it on, and that whenever a man dreams of being married he should be wedded and so on.\"\n\nThen the king stopped speaking. The pelandok lay with his eyes closed. When the king saw the pelandok lying like that as if he was asleep he called to him, \"Hai Selang Dirimba.\"\n\nWhen the pelandok heard the king call he started from his sleep and at once ordered the goat to go and get the torch. He said, \"Hai Sang Goat, go and get your torch at once.\"\n\nThe goat went and got it. Then the pelandok said, \"Light it.\"\n\nThe goat lit it. Then the pelandok made a disturbance and asked the goat for the torch, the king said,\n\n\"Hai Selang Dirimba what on earth do you mean by making this disturbance with this torch?\"\nThe pelandok answered, Your highness, while napping here just now, I dreamt that your house was burnt down, so I want to burn it.\"\n\n\"Who ordered the house to be burnt down?\"\n\n\"Pardon your majesty a thousand thousand pardons. I wanted to burn it because I dreamt that I did so, and you yourself decided that whenever one dreamt of eating one was to eat and that whenever one dreamt of putting a thing on one was to wear it and that whenever one dreamt of a wife one was to marry.\"\n\nWhen the king heard what the pelandok said, he said to the tiger, \"Hai, don't you eat the goat because whenever there is a dream like that don't carry it out for that would be tyrannous.\"\n\nA Pelandok Tale by the Penghulu of Pulau Tiga.\n\nAlk\u00e9sah ini hikayat ch\u00e9t\u00e9ra pelandok binatang hutan ampat kaki-nya lagi k\u00ebchil itu binatang l\u00ebbeh kurang b\u00e9sar kuching.

Maka tiada tiba ia-pun jaga deripada tidornya lalu disurohnya kambing itu mengambil suloh demikian bunyi-nya; \"Hai Sang Kambing pergi kamu ambil suloh lekas.\" Maka pergi-lah kambing turun mengambil sulohnya. Maka kata pelandok itu, \"Pasang api.\" Maka di-pasang oleh kambing itu api pada suloh, di-lihat oleh Raja itu pelandok gadoh memintak suloh kepada kambing itu ber-kata Raja itu. \"Hai Selang Dirimba apa nama-nya mungkin ber-gadoh dengan suloh ini?\" Maka dijawab oleh pelandok itu, \"Tuan-ku patek mengantok di sini tadi, bermimpi patek memakar rumah tuan-ku, ini-lah mungkinnya patek hendak bakar-ti akan rumah.\" \"Siapa beri hukum memakar rumah aku?\" Maka kata jawab pelandok, \"Ampun tuanku ber-ribu-ribu ampun, ada pun sebab patek hendak bakar ini rumah tuan-ku, kerana patek mimpi memakar rumah tuan-ku, ini dengan hukum tuan-ku kerana tiap-tiap mimpi memakan makan-kan dan tiap-tiap mimpi memakai pakai-kan dan tiap-tiap ber-istri dinikahkan.\" Maka Raja itu mendengarkan kata pelandok itu demikian bunyi-nya, \"Hai Haramau, jangan kamu makan kambing itu, kerana jikalau ada mimpi yang demikian, apa-apa mimpi jangan-lah dipertubuat adanya kerana thalim hukum-nya.\" Tamat.\nA Fourth Contribution to the Knowledge of the Hymenoptera of Sarawak.*\n\nBY P.

The basal tooth on the hind coxae is long, curved; and its apex reaches to the end the coxae; the lower one is much smaller, hardly one fourth of the length of the upper. The 2nd cubital cellule is clearly longer than wide, its apex being not much more than half its length on the posterior side; the 2nd transverse cubital nervure is about the length of the 1st abscissa of the radius; it is shorter than the 1st, the 2nd cellule being thus narrower at the apex than at the base.\n\nThere are 5 short, stout spines on the insideside of the fore tibi\u00e6; the abdomen is broader than the thorax; it is longish oval and is as long as the head and thorax united; the ocelli are in a black spot; a keel runs down from them to the antenn\u00e6; the antenn\u00e6 are filiform, much longer than the body.

December and March.\n\nFace strongly, the clypeus more weakly punctured. Front and vertex smooth and shining; the frontal spines are stout, about twice longer than they are thick at the base. Mesonotum rugosely punctured, shining; the parapsidal furrows are shallow, crenulated. Scutellum flat, sparsely punctured, except at the apex; the post-scutellum smooth, shining. The metanotum behind the keel is transversely striated-punctured; the rest coarsely, closely reticulated; the spines are about twice longer than they are wide at the base; their apex is rounded. Pleur\u00e6 closely strongly punctured; the lower half of the propleur\u00e6 strongly, closely striated; the apex of the mesopleur\u00e6 is irregularly striated. Scutellum flat.

Malar space distinct, half the length of the antennal scape. Transverse median nervure interstitial; the recurrent nervure is received near the apex of the areolet. Transverse median nervure in hind wings broken shortly below the middle. Tubercles small. Post-petiole widely dilated; the base of the petiole wider than the height of the sides.\n\nThe \u2642 is similarly coloured, except that the marks on the pleur\u00e6 are smaller; the antenn\u00e6 are much longer than the body, the post-petiole is narrower, longer compared with its width; the antenn\u00e6 are not serrate and are broadly white in the middle.\n\nThis species does not appear to differ much in generic characters from the neotropical species of *Poly\u00e6nus*; the only differences appear to be that in the American the transverse median nervure is not interstitial, but received behind the transverse basal; that the temples are longer, and distinctly obliquely narrowed, that the scutellum is not so flat, that there is no distinct area at the base of the metanotum, and that the abdominal petiole is longer, narrower and not nearly so much widened at the apex.\nTosquinet, it may be added, has described a species *P. cingulatus* which he refers to *Poly\u00e6nus* from New Guinea. (cf. Mem. de la Soc. Ent. de Belg.

The transverse median nervure is not quite interstitial; the neuration being very similar to that of S. umbrosus, cf. Kohl, Ann. K.K. Natur. Hofmus. V. Taf. VIII. f. 10. Claws bidentate, the basal slightly longer and thinner than the apical. The labrum is broadly rounded, neither toothed nor keeled. The 3rd to 5th ventral segments are roundly incised, the incision on the 5th being deeper than on the others; the last ends in a sharp point and is covered with long fulvous hair. The abdominal petiole is shorter distinctly than the hinder tibi\u00e6, being almost of the length of the hinder metatarsus.\n\nShould be readily recognized by the red apical segments of the abdomen from the known Indian and Malay species. In this respect it agrees with S. confrater Kohl from New Britain with which it cannot well be confounded. Sphex Franzi Cam. Ann. Mag. Nat.

Tibiae sparsely, the tarsi more thickly spinose; the spines short; the long spur of the hind tibiae is thickly covered with black hair at the base; it is about one third of the length of the metatarsus\u2014as long as the 2nd joint. The 2nd transverse median nervure is dilated in the middle, where the recurrent leaves it, the latter being also dilated (but not so strongly) at the base; in the hind wings the transverse anal nervure is received beyond the cubital.\n\nComes near to *S. fulgidipennis* Sans. and *S. iridipennis* Smith. The colour of the middle joints of the hind tarsi may be clear yellow, as it is on the 2nd joint of one leg, i.e. the testaceous colour of the other joints may be owing to discolouration. The coloured tarsal joints and the testaceous (yellow?) line on the inner orbits are probably characteristic.\n\n*R. A.

William Howell.\n\nAs soon as a woman is enceinte, restrictions come into force. These restrictions are binding on the husband as well as the wife. It is forbidden them to cut off creepers that hang over the water or over the road, lest the mother would suffer from haemorrhage after delivery. It is forbidden to dam a stream, to plait the rattan for fixing the adze, to make the broad plaiting for the hilt of a parang, to set up a dam for the fish-trap (bubu) and to drive a nail into a board lest the woman should have difficulty in the delivery. It is forbidden to pour out oil, lest the child should suffer from (tuli) inflammation of the ears; to fix the parang in its hilt lest the child be deaf; to break an egg, lest the child be blind; to plant a banana plant lest the head of the child be large; to burn the wood of the ficus to warm oneself, lest the child be dumb; to kill any animal lest the child be deformed and the nose bleed; to scrape smooth the shell of a coconut, lest the child's hair should not grow; to bring a fresh-water turtle into the room, lest the child should not be born; to dye anything black, lest the child be black.\n\nAs for the woman, if she goes anywhere she must return by the same way that she went so that the child should not know how it is to be delivered. It is further forbidden to eat anything in a mosquito curtain, lest the child should be still-born; to carry stones lest the child should be paralysed; to conceal anything, lest the delivery be difficult; to cast stones into the water, lest the child be not delivered and the mother die; to bend into a circle any piece of wood, else the child will not prosper; to hang a scar lest the child should cry the whole day and night.\n\nThere are several other restrictions of a minor character which are not worth mentioning. But it is interesting to\nnotice that in the case of nearly all these restrictions there are ways in which the above limitations may be circumvented and no evil effects follow. For example, though a man may not kill an animal yet if he does kill anything and runs away immediately then returns a few minutes afterwards and make some remarks aloud of this nature, \"I wonder who killed this animal?\" he has nothing to fear. A nail may not be driven into a board, but if a man drives a nail in gently a little way and then pulls it out again, he may drive the nail in all the way, and no law is broken.\n\nThe whole period of a woman's pregnancy is passed in the deepest anxiety and fear lest the antus (spirits) may assault her and her innocent babe. An ill dream or a small accident such as a fall is considered a portent signifying imminent danger to the child or perhaps it may be a portent signifying coming danger during her delivery, and therefore a sacrifice of a fowl must invariably be made to propitiate the spirits. It is not unusual to hear of a woman talking about another and telling how many fowls have been killed to save her during her pregnancy.\n\nIt is considered to be a fineable offence if the husband should wilfully violate any restrictions. The wife's relations would immediately bring him to justice.\n\nWhen the time of delivery is come and while she is in travail, two or three midwives are called to her assistance to accelerate the birth of the child. Nature is not allowed to pursue its own course but force is applied.\n\nAs soon as the child makes its appearance into the world, a signal is given by beating a bamboo receptacle with a stick, or a brass gong is struck, or maybe a gun is fired to announce that a child is born in the house. Immediately follows a religious ceremony a fowl being waved over the heads of all present, including the infant and its mother. The fowl is then killed and the blood is smeared on the foreheads of those present.\n\nAfter the mother and the child are washed and dressed, the afterbirth is deposited in a plaited bag and hung on a tree either in their cemetery or in their tembawai the site of their former house. The infant is sprinkled with a compound of\npinang (betelnut) and lawang (zedoary) is bandaged and made to lie on the spathe of an areca palm, a cloth is put round it, and a Dyak sheet hung over it. One of the women who assisted at the birth washes the child and cuts the umbilical cord. She is afterwards rewarded with a parang, an entadu plate, and a long piece of the black tina (black split rotan worn round the waist). The mother is seated with her back against a blazing fire, she drinks freely of ginger-tea to facilitate her discharge.\n\nAs soon as the umbilical cord has dropped off, the infant, for the first time, is taken to the bathing-place. The man who carries the child takes a fowl with him. As soon as they come to the bathing-place the fowl is killed and a wing is cut off. If it be a male child this wing is tied on with a piece of red thread to a spear, and if the child be of the other sex this wing is tied on to an implement used by Dyak women in weaving (leletan). On the fourth day the spear or the leletan, as the case may be, is taken back to the house.\n\nWhen the child is able to look about, to laugh, to turn on its side, to roll over, to crawl, to go on all-fours, to sit up, to walk holding on to something, to walk by itself, the restrictions with regard to the killing of animals or snakes are still binding, the child has not cut its teeth. As soon as this has taken place there is an end to all restrictions. If the child dies before it cuts its teeth the parents do not observe the mourning customs.\n\nThe Dyaks of old, it appears, did not know how to assist a woman when she was in travail, consequently many brutal practices were adopted.\n\nThe knowledge was first came to be possessed by a certain man named Kelili Badak Resa, whose wife was Teburi. When his wife was enceinte he went out into the jungle with a blowpipe. There he saw the maias (orang-utan) assisting the female at the birth of its young and he saw that they used lia (ginger) and also bandages. Afterwards his wife gave birth to a child and Kelili Badak Resa was able to assist a woman when she was in travail in the same way as the maias did. After his child was born he called him Maling, and gave him the title of Panting Bunga Mengala.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 46, 1906.\nIt must not be omitted that after a woman has given birth to a child and before she is bandaged, ground ginger is placed on the abdomen and is changed once or twice a day. This process continues for a month or perhaps less, as the case may be, while the woman is still drinking the ginger-tea.\n\nThe husband or whoever takes away the afterbirth to bury or hang on a tree is solemnly warned by the mother not to look to the right or to the left as he leaves the room, lest the child might squint.\n\nAs the mother sits with her back to the fire in the room holding in her hands the handle of a native adze (bliong) she presses it to her stomach to assist the course of nature. For twenty-four hours she is not allowed to drink water, but if she does, it must be very little and first warmed lest fever should set in. Her food is light and simple. The husband goes out to get certain kinds of fish which is first smoked before it is eaten.\n\nThe mother is not allowed to sleep for twenty-four hours after giving birth to a child, nor is she even allowed to lie down. One would think that after such a fatiguing time, a rest was most essential and to be deprived of it would be detrimental to health. Strange to say it is not so.\n\nThe period of a Dyak woman's confinement is doubtful. It depends entirely on the strength of the woman. I have known several cases of women going out three days after their confinement to the paddy fields.\n\nThe person who takes away the afterbirth brings back with him a young shoot of a kind of fern (Kreniong) for his spear, a leaf of a kind of fern (Kalindu) for his shield, and a kind of grass (Kejejuru) for his plume on the head. These things are stuck up in the room.\n\nIt is interesting to know of other restrictions which come into force after a woman has given birth to a child. It is forbidden to eat prawns lest the child beats a retreat when he is on the war-path; to eat eggs lest the child should have sores on the head; to eat the fern called paku, lest the child be exhausted on the war-path. Pork can only be eaten when the child begins to bite or suck its toe. It is forbidden to\nthresh cotton in the house or village, lest the mother should feel stiff; to prepare a kind of lily for thread, lest the mother should feel a crazy sensation; to lie down on a bemban mat, lest the mother should have rheumatism; to give suck to the child lying down, lest the child should be deaf; to give suck to the child in the water lest the child should have bad teeth; to eat sugar-cane, lest the mother should give birth frequently.\n\nIt is very often the case that the mother has no milk for the child for perhaps two or three days or a week after it is born, and the child has to live on masticated cooked rice. It is believed by Dyaks that a kind of land crab (grama) when cooked and eaten by the mother will produce milk.\n\nEnough has not been said about the ceremony of taking the child to the watering place to bathe for the first time. It is not necessary to repeat what has already been written but it is a very solemn ceremony. Every family has its own peculiarities of ceremony, which are more or less attached to religious rites. With some families the village or house is tabooed when a child is born. The doors are marked with sign to denote non-admittance to strangers until the umbilical cord of the child has dropped off. Anybody trespassing in the house or village is not allowed to leave until the umbilical cord has dropped off, which may be five or seven days. Should any one leave the house before that time he is liable to a heavy fine of a full-grown pig. Unless this custom is carried out, the child might suffer from blindness.\n\nOnce on my usual tour round my mission at a place called Pua-ai, one of my followers entered into a large village when it was too dark to discern anything, to buy some rice for our consumption. He was detained in the house. Three of the people in the village came to see me and brought the rice which he bought and explained matters to me. This was unfortunate as I could not stay there more than two nights, so I had to redeem my friend by paying for a large pig.\n\nAfter the umbilical cord has dropped off the village or house is no longer tabooed and the marks or signs are taken off. Some families have not got such customs.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 46, 1906.\nI must mention one case in which I was the innocent victim. It happened in a Christian family whom I had converted and baptized. To my great surprise and indignation when the wife was confined, the house was pronounced tabooed, but I entered it. I was told that I had incurred upon myself a heavy fine. The wife explained that she had lost an eye. It was because some one had entered the house when she was born. With much difficulty and persuasion I answered her that every Christian was to give up all such superstitions for we had One to protect us against such calamities. I also assured them that if the child was to be so ill-fated I would be responsible for it. She has since had six children none the worse for it.\n\nThe ceremony of first taking a child to bathe is called by the Dyaks *nganjong mandi* which means to take to bathe. The mother calls a maiden and asks her to catch a fowl. The husband or anybody waves the fowl over the child and then kills it. The maiden who is asked to catch the fowl is honoured by being asked to carry the child to the bathing-place. After the fowl is killed, a wing is deposited in an areca spathe with some ashes. The maiden carries the child in a gaudy home-made blanket, wears a gaudy sun-hat, holds in one hand ignited *lukai*, which is the bark of the *lukai* tree. She marches down to the bathing-place gracefully, and the mother follows with a little boy armed with a spear and the spathe of the areca, containing the ashes and the wing of the fowl. When the bathing-place is reached, the wing of the fowl with the ashes in the spathe of the areca, is pierced with the spear and placed standing alongside the bathing place. The maiden then walks gently down into the water to give the child its ablutions, or rather to introduce the child to the general bathing-place. They return to the house and the spear is left behind. When the house is reached, beads are threaded and tied round the legs, to act as eyes to prevent the child from slipping. Beads are also tied round the hands in order not to make a miss when throwing a spear. The lips of the child are slightly besmeared with bugs in order that when it chews the lips might appear red. It is made to suck the tail\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nof a *Kli* fish to prevent it from having thrush too soon.

RIDLEY.\n\nThe collection of living animals in the Botanic Gardens in Singapore dates from the days when the gardens were the property of the Agri-Horticultural Society. This society was founded in 1859, but not finding sufficient support from the general public to develop and maintain the grounds adequately, eventually made over its property to the Government in 1874, and in 1875 Mr. J. Murton was appointed Superintendent. The Zoological part of the garden seems however to have been at first under the control of Mr. Krohn, who publishes in 1876 a report on the Zoological collections. That year Mr. Cheang Hong Sin presented a monkey house to the gardens, which still exists, and a list of the animals in the gardens was published. It included a rhinoceros, sloth-bear, kangaroos, and other animals, and a number of birds. In 1878 it was decided to dispose of the larger animals and most were sent to the Calcutta Zoological Gardens. Birds, monkeys and small animals were however kept. From 1888 the aviaries and enclosures were increased, and till 1902 the collection became very representative of the fauna of the Malay peninsula and islands. No funds were granted by the Government for its up-keep after 1881, but its expenses were paid out of what could be spared from the Gardens Vote. Many of the animals and birds were presented by various donors, so that the expenses were merely feeding, and housing. The cost being from about \u00a3100 to \u00a3150 per year when the collection was at its largest. In 1902, an admirer of Zoological Gardens urged that the collection was worthy of a better class of houses than could be afforded from the Gardens Vote, and an estimate for improved and more ornamental houses was prepared, but it was considered too expensive by the Government, and an\norder was received to abolish the menagerie in 1903, which had to be gradually carried into effect.\n\nPerhaps there are few places in the world more suited for a Zoological Garden than Singapore. The climate is well suited for all the tropical animals, the cost of keeping them is much lower than in most parts of the world, for firing, an important and expensive item in many gardens, is unnecessary; forage for the deer and other herbivorous animals, costs little or nothing, and fish for the piscivorous birds is readily procured. Animals of great interest can be procured for a small cost, and indeed a great number have been presented and offered to the gardens. The neighbouring islands and mainlands produce many animals which cannot be kept in any of the European or American Menageries, but which thrive well in Singapore, and even breed in captivity. Notable successes in this way in the Singapore Gardens are the successful breeding of the Jackal, the Kijang, (cervulus muntjac) the Napu (Tragulus Napu) and the hybrid monkeys and the green viper none of which, as far as I know, have previously bred in captivity elsewhere.\n\nTo the large number of passengers who visit Singapore on their way eastwards or westwards a Zoological collection is very attractive, and the menagerie in its best days was known all over the world, and was the first thing asked for by the visitor. There seems also something eminently suitable in having a menagerie in the colony founded by Sir Stamford Raffles who was also one of the founders of the finest Zoological Gardens in the world,\u2014that of London.\n\nAnimals in captivity. There are a certain number of people in the world who assume that an animal must be very unhappy in captivity, and especially if their ideas of what any given animal should enjoy do not concur with those of the animal itself. I suppose all keepers of menageries have received from time to time the most ridiculous letters with suggestions as to how to treat animals, of which the writers often know not even the name still less the habits. The descendants of the man who buttered the hay for his horse are by no means extinct.\nWhen the Gibbon (*Hylobates*) was proudly giving its well-known solo in its best style to an audience of globe trotter's, one mistaken individual rushed wildly into the office to say that the monkey was in great pain and making a great crying. On another occasion a lady wanted someone to be prosecuted because a fine tigress called regularly at sundown, and she thought it must be ill. Others whose idea of the shape of a living tiger was based on a badly stuffed Museum specimen think that a tiger whose body is not like a bolster must be starved, whereas a tiger is almost a greyhound among cats when in good condition.\n\nAs a matter of fact animals as a rule not only become quite accustomed to captivity in a very short time, but usually prefer it to a wild life. They get their food regularly and without having to hunt for it and can spend the rest of their day playing about or sleeping. Animals which have been in cages for quite a short time are helpless when they are turned loose or escape. People who have kept pet monkeys and on going home wish to get rid of them sometimes turn them loose in the Garden Jungle to join the other wild ones, which is as considerate as to send a child away to find and make friends with a tribe of savages. The monkeys thus released dare not go near the wild ones, do not know how to get food, otherwise than by going to the nearest house where they sometimes arrive in a starving condition. Some pelicans presented to the Gardens after remaining in an enclosure for less than a day, were put on the Garden Lake, where were plenty of fish. They got off the Lake at once and stood on one of the roads flapping their wings and opening their beaks at any carriage which came by to the alarm of the horses. Then they walked straight back to the enclosure and waited outside the door all night till the keeper returned and let them in. Some phalangers which escaped one night were very puzzled what to do. All but one sat on the top of the cage all night. The remaining one rambled aimlessly along the path where it was found next morning. Squirrels, musangs, and such small animals if they escape usually take to the woods naturally, but often remain near the cages for a long time before they disappear. If an\nanimal dislikes captivity at all, it is easily seen. It mopes, or is restless, feeds only when no one is by, and is certain to pine away soon. The big civets *Viverra tangalunga* and *Pagurus lencomystax* particularly dislike a bright cage. Being nocturnal animals, only coming out after dusk, the light annoys them very much and the *Viverras* dislike being looked at by a crowd of people and become very nervous. To put these animals in a fine open cage that looks nice from a popular point of view is cruel. The cages should be half dark, when the animals do very well and live for many years. Curiously some animals and birds much prefer small cages to large ones. Some love birds (*Loricula galgulus*) were put in an ornamental canary-cage, which one would have thought they preferred to the round rattan cages in which the Malays keep them and in which their heads nearly touch the top. This did not suit them at all, and nearly all died in a few days. The remaining two were put back in the Bamboo cage and lived quite well and happy.\n\nThe only way of knowing what an animal thinks is comfortable and snug is to keep it and observe its ways. It will soon let you know what it likes, which probably does not at all fall in with your ideas of what it ought to like.\n\n**AN ACCOUNT OF ANIMALS KEPT.**\n\n*Quadrumana.*\n\n*Simia satyrus*, L. The Mias. Orangoutan.\n\nThis has often been on view. The animals are obtained from Sumatra and Borneo and are usually young, but very large adults have not seldom been brought to Singapore. Young Mias are very quiet and tame, but full grown adults are dangerous and require a very strong iron cage. The animal is very delicate and liable to a disease resembling cholera which seems almost invariably fatal. A good deal of the art of keeping one healthy consists in giving it a varied diet. Bread, boiled rice, pineapple, plantains, eggs occasionally, sugarcane, kangkong (*Ipomea aquatica*) or some such green stuff suits it well. When young and not\ndangerous it is allowed to go out for walks by itself every day, to climb on the trees, and amuse itself. It requires a box or basket to sleep in with a rug, or bit of sacking to wrap itself with. It appreciates alcoholic liquors especially if sweet, such as port but it will often take whisky or beer. One which is now in the London Zoological Gardens smoked cigarettes or cigars, lighting one from the other, knocking off the ash, and puffing the smoke through its nose.\n\nThe Mias is always a quiet slow moving beast, and being constructed for arboreal life is not in its element on the ground. It is very human in the way it uses a blanket and pillow, carefully arranging the pillow under its head, and drawing the blanket over itself, and when it has arranged this to its satisfaction and lies on its back peacefully smoking a cigarette, it looks more than ever like an indolent man. Young ones rarely make any sounds with the mouth, but when quite young if annoyed it cries like a child, stamping its feet on the ground. When older, about 4 or 5 years old the Mias does not cry, and seems to be almost dumb, occasionally grunting, and blowing with its lips when vexed. They laugh however when tickled, and often, at about seven years old quite loud. The last one kept in the Gardens, was very fond of swinging on a door, sitting on the top and pushing itself backwards and forwards like a child on a gate. When young they are very docile and obedient and very much attached to anyone who is kind to them. Many are fond of having a common monkey to pet and play with, others seem to find the small monkey a bore, and a nuisance.\n\nWhen pleased with anyone they protrude their lips to kiss them, and they often kiss each other.\n\nThe youngest I have seen were a pair brought for sale, undoubtedly twins as they were exactly the same size, and age. They were very scantily provided with hair. The male was very active, moving about briskly like one of the common monkeys. This baby-activity soon goes off and as they become older they seem to become more indolent.\n\nAs they grow the hair becomes longer and denser especially apparently in the male, but later in life they often\nappear to lose the hair on the body to a considerable extent, and the female sometimes at least becomes almost nude about the breast and abdomen when she gets near the breeding age.\n\nAll evidence we have seems to show that the Mias develops at the same rate as a man, the teeth changing at the same period of life. Practically however nothing is known of the later development.\n\nThere are undoubtedly several forms of the Mias, perhaps species differing in the presence or absence of fleshy flanges to the face, size of apparently full grown animals, and color of the hair, which varies from bright orange colour to dark brown.\n\n*Hylobates syndactylus.*\n\nThe Siamang is very seldom to be procured. I only remember to have seen two in captivity. One of which a very young one was in the Gardens for some time. When happy it makes a very loud booming noise, which can be heard far away. A young one brought for sale by a Malay, lived in a cloth bag, into which it would jump and its weight pulling the strings closed the bag, in which it would sleep curled up.\n\n*H. Agilis.*\n\nThe Wawa, is one of the most popular pets, and lives well in captivity, and a number have been kept in the Gardens menagerie. There are three colour varieties; black with a white face the commonest, white, and grey the rarest form. They are usually very gentle unless ill-treated, and always give pleasure to visitors by their marvellous agility, and by their weird song or wail. They usually sing shortly after sunrise, and in captivity also often when there are a number of visitors looking at them. They have few other sounds, a kind of low plaintive wail when they are very friendly, and a kind of grunting when they are on heat, are all the noises they make. The food is boiled rice, fruit, sweet potatoes, bread, etc. They have never bred in captivity.\n\nThe Wawa often lives a long time and specimens have died of old age in the Gardens; but there was no clue to their age. The chief disease they are liable to is pneumonia from a chill,\nespecially during heavy rains, and on one occasion an infectious stomatitis, killed two Wawas and a Siamang, all in the same cage, very quickly.\n\nSemnopithecus.\n\nThe long tailed monkeys known as Lotongs are not at all easily kept in confinement. Even the Malays consider them very difficult to keep. The following species have been kept for a longer or shorter period.\n\nSemnopithecus cristatus.\n\nA specimen of this handsome monkey only lived a short time dying rather suddenly, apparently from heat.\n\nS. rubicundus.\n\nA very old specimen was obtained and kept for a short time. Its bright red fur and light blue face gave it a most comic appearance, which was increased by its looks of indignation when it was laughed at.\n\nS. maurus.\n\nA black species was kept also for a time.\n\nS. sp.\n\nA quite white monkey said to have come from Sumatra, lived for a short time, but it was very old and died of old age not very long after it was obtained.\n\nMacacus cynemolgus.\n\nThe K'ra, has always been kept on view. It is a very easy monkey to keep and breeds readily in confinement. There are a number also wild in the Gardens.\n\nM. fasciatus.\n\nThe Japanese monkey; one of these was deposited for a time in the Gardens.\n\nM. nemestrinus.\n\nThe Berok was always kept, a monkey very easy to keep but which never breeds in confinement so far as I know.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 46, 1906.\nHybrids between *M. cynomolgus* and *nemestrinus* however are readily bred.\n\n*M. umbrinus.*\n\nThe Nicobar monkey resembles the K\u2019ra, but is darker in colour and much larger. One presented by Dr. Abbott became pregnant by a K\u2019ra, but both mother and child died shortly after the birth, apparently from weakness.\n\nThe first hybrid monkey that was produced was the offspring of a male K\u2019ra with a female Berok, in 1895. He is still alive in the Zoological Gardens, London and a very handsome powerful monkey, but became rather savage, attacking the other ones in the cage and had to be separated. He quite combines the appearances of both the parents, his long face, and habit of walking on all fours reminds the observer of the Berok, his fur is colored like that of the K\u2019ra, the tail is much longer than that of the Berok, but much shorter than that of the K\u2019ra, and he carries it elegantly arched, like a lion, his keeper would say. He was sent to the English Zoological Gardens in 1905, where he is at present.\n\nThe other hybrid was between a male Berok and a female of the short haired *Cynopithecus niger*. In the same cage was a very savage male *Cynopithecus niger* of the long haired form. He would not breed with the other *Cynopithecus* and did not seem to take any notice of her. The female became pregnant but died at parturition being unable to deliver herself of the young one, and owing to the ferocity of the male no one could go into the cage to assist her. The young one was fully developed and had some characters of both parents. It was preserved in spirits at the museum.\n\n**General Notes on Monkeys.**\n\nSo little seems to be known as to the habits of the commonest monkeys that the following notes may be of interest.\n\n*Macacus cynomolgus.*\n\nThe K\u2019ra is the commonest and most conspicuous species here. It inhabits edges of jungle and small woods but seldom goes into high jungle. The animals live in small families\npresided over by a large male. There has long been a number of this monkey in the Botanical Gardens jungle, but of late they have diminished in numbers owing to the clearing away of the woods in the neighbourhood, and the failure of food supply due to this is probably the reason of their diminished numbers. There are now two families of them, one in the Upper Garden and one in the Economic Garden. Each of these families consists of two or more adult males, some younger males and a number of females. It would be perhaps incorrect to say that all these are descended from a single pair, or two pairs, but as there has not apparently been any admixture of fresh blood for very many years, they must all be very closely related. It is true that residents have on several occasions released their pet monkeys in the gardens so that they can join the wild ones, but the freed ones do not usually do so but almost invariably go to the nearest house for food and remain there till they are either caught or shot as nuisances. In a family of monkeys no stranger is admitted without a fight. If a female is put with the family the females attack her. If a male the males attack him. He or she generally gets badly bitten and sometimes killed. If the stranger can hold his own he may be accepted, and eventually may, if powerful enough, become head of the clan. In fighting, the top of the head and the thorax are the points generally attacked.\n\nA Berok, *Macacus emestrinus* of no great size but a powerful monkey, during the absence of the keeper, broke his way into a cage of kras, and was set upon; when rescued he was found nearly insensible with the scalp torn and hanging from the top of his head and a bite through the thorax into the lungs, whence air was issuing. He completely recovered in about a week, or so, and lived for several years, when again he broke the cage and got among the enemy. Though a powerful monkey he offered practically no resistance and this time received a bite on the thigh, which would have been of no importance but it got infected with tetanus of which he died in about three days.\n\nA great fight took place among the wild monkeys in the gardens on one occasion, between the old king monkey and a\nyounger one; probably however some of the other males joined in. A couple of days afterwards the old veteran was found in the morning lying dead by a waterbutt, with his throat cut across, and some other fresh wounds, and his shoulder swollen and gangrened from injuries received in his first fight. He was sent to the museum to skeletonize when it was found that at some much earlier date three ribs had been broken and had mended again.\n\nThe leading monkey having established his position, takes his food first, and has his selection of the females first. The other males he drives away should they presume to attempt to usurp his rights. In processions from one place to the other he always comes last, but if one of the younger monkeys gets into a dangerous position or is attacked he always runs to its rescue, and drives off the enemy, and the other big males often assist him if necessary. The wild monkeys always sleep in particular trees, those with bare branches and very lofty, and towards evening they may be seen slowly moving along, stopping here and there to eat, till they reach the sleeping place about sundown, they then settle down for the night, sitting usually in pairs or singly on the bare boughs. The same tree is occupied every evening for weeks at a time, and wherever they are in the evening they make for the same spot. They never sleep in a bushy tree, probably for fear of being surprised at night by snakes. Young monkeys are always born in the early hours of the morning before daylight, as almost if not all mammals are, and are born in the boughs, or if in a cage on the perch; never I believe on the ground. In cases of difficult parturition at least, the other females act as accoucheuses, with sometimes disastrous results to the baby. But difficulties in births are rare even in the cage and I have only seen one or two. The K'ra breeds very easily in captivity, the females producing one at a time about once a year. The young one when born has black hair which gets lighter colored with age. The Berok Macacus nemestrinus does not breed in captivity; at least it has never done so with its own race in the gardens. But it has been successfully crossed with the K'ra, and also with Cynopithecus niger.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nI have occasionally seen old monkeys which appeared to be insane, incessantly gibbering at nothing and behaving in a quite meaningless way. It might be said that it would be difficult to tell whether a monkey was mad or not, as their ordinary ways of going on are so wild, but as a matter of fact, any one who observes a sane monkey closely can see why it behaves as it does, and what it means by so doing. Often monkeys, Beroks especially, invent comic tricks to amuse onlookers, thus one used to pass its hindleg over its neck, and beat it on the ground and pretend it could not get it back, but these tricks are evidently games invented for fun. Out-breaks of maniacal ferocity occur also in ordinarily quiet monkeys, and these are commonest at night and apparently in the very early hours of the morning, about 4 or 5 a.m. A male monkey ordinarily quiet thus attacked a female whom he was very fond of and inflicted severe injuries on her, destroying the sight of one eye, from which injuries she never recovered properly, but wasted away, and after producing a still born young one died.\n\nThe monkey which attacked her seemed very sad when he was found next morning, and sat by her all day trying to console her. This is not the only case of this nocturnal ferocity. I have seen among these monkeys, and cases of ferocious murder in human beings at about this period of the night are too common as is well known. Monkeys of course often quarrel for more or less valid reasons both in a wild state and in the cage, and bite each other spitefully. When one would bite the others it was found quite sufficient to nip off the tips of the canine teeth with a pair of strong wire snippers. It does not hurt the animal at all if properly done and the teeth do not decay, and when he finds he cannot bite through the skin of another monkey he gives it up. Old monkeys often have the teeth decayed, and worn away, but they never seem to suffer any pain from decayed teeth, and I have never seen any inflammation of the jaw caused by them.\n\nThe K\u2019ra is a very loquacious animal and has an extensive vocabulary in which respects it is very different from the anthropoid apes, who seldom speak at all. Some of the noises of the K\u2019ra have quite obvious meanings, thus the word\nKrra from which it takes its Malay name, is only used as an alarm note for a man or dog in sight. A quite different sound is used for a tiger or perhaps for any large animal. If a young monkey gets into a small tree and alarmed at the approach of any one utters its little squeaks of fright, and is afraid to try a long jump into the safety of a taller tree, the king monkey comes as near as he safely can do it and utters a peculiar grunt \"umh\" \"umh\" till the little one makes a wild spring and escapes from its peril. Meanwhile the old one threatens the enemy with an entirely different bark at intervals. This latter sounds much the same as the cry that two males quarrelling begin their abuse of each other. Young monkeys have also a number of plaintive cries which do not seem to mean anything and which older monkeys do not use.\n\nWhen the monkeys see a snake they get very excited and make a great chattering. On one occasion when a terrier was attacking a cobra, the monkeys came from some distance to the scene of the fight, so close I could almost touch them, and quite regardless of me and the dog, peered down to see if they could see the snake which was hidden from their sight in the thick fern. I presume they judged from the noise the dog was making what he was attacking, or they may have heard the snorting of the cobra, when they were close enough. The duration of life of these smaller monkeys seems to be about 20 years, but I cannot be certain of this. The hybrid Kra-Berok is now 11 years old and is in very fine condition showing no signs of age. The big black Cynopithecus, which was full grown, and probably 8 or 10 years old when he was obtained, lived for 10 years in the gardens and died of old age. Several other monkeys have died of old age, but they were old when they were obtained. Monkeys do not suffer from consumption here as they do in Europe. The causes of death of the monkeys in the gardens, have been, beside old age, pneumonia, not rare in the Wawas (Hylobates), stomatitis (three Hylobates apparently an infectious disease which killed all three in one cage; tetanus (one); and fatty degeneration of the heart. Two badging monkeys died of this from over feeding. Being very greedy and always getting the first food, they got\nso fat that the heart was quite enclosed in cushions of fat. One, and if I remember correctly, the other fell dead after a Chinese holiday, when crowds of people came and gave the animals so much food that the orgy proved fatal.\n\n*Cynopithecus niger.*\n\nBoth forms of this monkey have been kept in the Gardens Menagerie. The short-haired form from Celebes and the long-haired one from Batchian. I cannot find in any books that these two apes have been separated specifically anywhere, which is rather remarkable, considering how the mammals have been divided up on very scanty characters by Zoologists. The short-haired form is the commonest, and is often brought into Singapore by the Bugis men. The long-haired one, a bigger ape, is very distinct not only in size and length of hair but it also possesses a large patch of grey hair on the buttocks. Only one of these has been on view in the gardens, a fine male. He was received when apparently full grown in 1891 and died of old age in 1905. He was a very vicious and powerful ape when he first came, and it was unsafe to go into his cage, as he flew at the throat of any one who attempted it. Later he became much quieter, but was never really safe. This monkey was the only one I ever saw who had any idea of throwing. He threw stones over-hand as a woman does, with considerable accuracy, and visitors often threw stones into his cage which he hurled back at them through the bars and on some occasions hit a visitor on the head or face. One lady indeed got a cut on the mouth from a stone she had imprudently thrown to him. When pleased with any one he would turn his back and standing erect often on one leg would grasp the back of the left thigh with the right hand. (*Macacus nemestrinus* often does the same thing). When he drank from a tin, it was his delight to suddenly throw the tin and the rest of the water over the keeper who was giving it to him. Though confined for some time in a cage with a female of the short-haired form he never attempted to breed with her, nor was otherwise than friendly with a male Berok who was in the same cage and bred with the female. The short-haired black ape is very good-tempered usually, but very mischievous.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 46, 1906.\nI have seen one on board ship seize the cap from one passing by and throw it overboard. Two which were put temporarily into an empty tiger's cage soon escaped by unroofing part of it, throwing the tiles down and speedily making a hole large enough to escape. When the coolie got on the roof with a sack to through over one, it suddenly pulled the sack from his hand and rushed off with it. These monkeys live a long time and suffer little from sickness. One was killed by stomatitis, and some died of old age.\n\nThey are affectionate apes, and recognize acquaintances readily. Two which were bought by a passenger and kept for a short time in the gardens were sent to the London Zoological Gardens, where I saw them about a year later, when they immediately recognized me and came down to shake hands, though the keeper advised me that they were savage! Common and easily procured here, they seem to be seldom sent to European Gardens.\n\n*Nycticebus tardigradus.*\n\nThe Slow Loris. This little lemur is common and often caught by the Malays, and many have been on view in the gardens. It does not seem to be long lived and is a dull creature in captivity, remaining curled up all day and only moving about slowly at night. Its food, in a wild state, consists of fruit, insects, and small birds. It seems strange that so slow and weak a creature should be able to hold its own in a country where there are so many predacious animals, for it appears to have no means of defence. It is however not so harmless as it appears, as it can bite sharply, and its bite is poisonous. Two instances of injury from its bite have been described to me. Many years ago Mr. H. Everett while talking to his brother, one evening in Borneo saw one of these little animals in a ditch and picked it up. It bit him on the hand, and he threw it down. His brother was walking away, and though Mr. Everett could hear his footsteps now in the distance he was unable to call him. His mouth and tongue swelled up, and he was unable to walk. He attempted to crawl up the hill to his own house, but only managed to get\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nthere next morning. When found he was unable to speak, with his tongue protruding from his mouth. His clerk who found him, cut the clothes round his neck, and managed eventually to recover him. In the second case a lady in Singapore was bitten by a Loris on the hand, and her mouth and tongue swelled up very much, but the swelling went down towards evening. No other part of the body seemed to be affected by the bites. The natives all know of the danger of the bite of the animal, but it is said that it is only dangerous when fresh caught, and after it has been in captivity for sometime it is not poisonous.\n\nThe weird appearance of the Loris with its large round eyes, and its habit of covering its face with its paws has given rise to many tales concerning it. It is supposed to have the faculty of seeing spirits, which is why it covers its face, as presumably it does not want to see them. Its use in native medicine with other superstitions about it have been published in the Journ. Roy. As. Soc. S. Br. vol. 34.\n\nGaleopithecus volans.\n\nThe flying lemur, is common in many of the Singapore woods, but it is not easy to get or keep in captivity. I have had young ones taken from the mother when killed twice, and endeavoured to rear them. They took milk readily but died in a few days from cold, as it seemed impossible to keep them dry. An adult captured in Singapore was kept for some days, and was being taught to live on bananas, when it managed to escape. In a wild state they live on leaves, the intestines of those killed being usually packed with nibbled up leaves, but the animals in captivity would not eat such leaves as I offered them. Their cry in the forests resembles the quacking of a duck.\n\nFELID\u00c6.\n\nFelis tigris.\n\nFive or more tigers have been kept in the garden at different times. They are always easily procurable, but usually the funds of the garden were not large enough for the keep of so\nexpensive an animal. Two cubs were kept for a short time in order to train them to eat meat previous to shipping them to Europe. They were about as big as large cats, with ridiculously large heads and paws. Remarkably tame and friendly, they would follow me about the garden for short walks, putting up their tails and rubbing their heads against my legs like tame cats. In a few days they had learnt to eat meat instead of requiring milk, which was difficult to get on board ship, and Sir Charles Mitchell, then Governor, who owned them, had them sent home to the Zoological Gardens. They were great pets on board ship, where they ran loose. They had grown as big as leopards when I saw them in England some months later, but were still tame enough to stroke. I heard afterwards that they died during the time of change of teeth, always a risky time with tigers. Before they were shipped a live chicken was put in their cage, and though the little animals had never seen one before, the biggest one darted at it and gave it such a blow with its paw that the chicken was sent flying like a ball against the wall of the cage falling dead instantly.\n\nA fine young tigress taken from a nest in Pahang was presented to the gardens by M. Wise, in 1895 and lived there till 1903, when it was sold. She passed safely through the ordeal of changing her teeth, though considerable care had to be taken with her at that time, and she had to be dosed with santonine put in a piece of meat. She was usually very quiet, with Europeans at least, though she disliked natives, and would charge the side of the cage and strike violently with her paws if the keeper leant with his back against the bars, but never did so when he faced her. As the cage had to be enlarged for her, she had to be temporarily transferred to a travelling cage in which she could only just turn round. She was kept there for some weeks and when the large cage was ready she absolutely refused to leave the travelling cage, so that a fire of paper had to be made near the cage in the hope that the smoke might induce her to go into the large cage, but she took no notice till a piece of paper suddenly burst into flame, when she walked slowly into the cage and then made a\n\nJour, Straits Branch\nrush to the further end, and finding a wooden platform put for her to sit on, investigated it carefully by feeling with her paws underneath before she would sit on it. She was fed on pariah dogs, beef, or goat, and always supplied with grass which she would often take from the hand. She got tired of dogs after a time, and her diet had to be changed. Chickens she used to appreciate. First plucking all the feathers off she washed the carcase carefully in her water before eating it. She was also partial to rats, holding them in her paws and biting off the head and gradually eating them. Occasionally a tiger requires liquid blood, as otherwise it gets constipated, and this was always difficult to get, as she would not touch it if coagulated. A rhinoceros having died in the gardens she thoroughly enjoyed its flesh, and also drank the blood greedily. She very much delighted in rolling on her back in a shallow tank of water provided for her, especially on hot days. When she became full grown she took to roaring at sundown, and occasionally later, especially on moonlight nights, and her cry Ah-oum could be heard at a great distance. Like most of the local tigers she was very light coloured the fur being quite yellow. Another very fine tiger kept for some time in the gardens before being sent to Cairo, was of a rich chestnut brown. It had been caught in Sumatra. The food of a tiger costs about fifty dollars a month. Other examples were offered by H. H. the Sultan of Johore and other people, but the expense of keeping these big cats was too great for the limited funds of the gardens. A wild tiger inhabited the Garden Jungle for some months in 1893, having probably wandered there from Bukit Timah.\n\n*Felis pardus.*\n\nThe Leopard though easily procurable, could not be kept on account of its cost in food. However in 1876 a spotted leopard presented by the King of Siam, was on view for some time, and a couple of cubs of the black panther were deposited in the gardens for a short time. The latter were very vicious, though quite small. They snarled and fought whenever any one came near them.\n\nR. A. Ste., No 46, 1906.\nFelis tristis.\n\nA full grown female of this large cat was sent to the gardens in a stick cage one night, and was put temporarily in part of the monkey cage. It however managed to escape from its travelling cage, and as it could not be recaptured with any safety it had to be shot. The carcase was sent to the museum.\n\nF. Temmincki.\n\nA golden cat was sent from Pahang in 1893, and lived for some time, when it suddenly died. It was a very quiet and handsome animal with its marbled orange tabby fur. It was one of the most placid cats I ever saw. As there was some difficulty in getting its travelling cage into the large cage, endeavours were made to get it to walk into its new home, but nothing would induce it to move. When squirted at with water it sat still and lapped up the water; when a smoke of brown paper was made it folded its paws and went to sleep. Finally the travelling cage was got into the large cage and broken to pieces, till at last the cat remained sitting calmly on the last bit of the box.\n\nF. bengalensis.\n\nThe Leopard cat is the kind most commonly brought in for sale. It is a beautiful little animal, hardly as big as a good sized English cat, yellow with round black spots. When caught full grown it is usually extremely vicious. Two kept in one cage always watched carefully at feeding time for the keeper, to try and strike him with their paws when he opened the small side door to put the food in. Being nocturnal they are generally very quiet, hardly moving all day, and frequently only feeding at night. When caught as kittens they can sometimes be made as tame as an English cat. One kept for a long time by Mr. Hervey in Malacca was presented by him to the gardens where it lived many years, and was quite tame and would play like a kitten with anyone. Formerly it was kept loose in the house in Malacca but it got so very sportive and smashed so much glass and china that it had to be shut up.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nOn one occasion it got out of its cage in the gardens into a gallery at the back of the cages and no one could catch it. When I cornered it and stooped down to pick it up it sprang over my head, but it did not attempt to bite or scratch. It must have been 12 or 13 years old when it died, and I believe then it was killed by a cobra or other poisonous snake. Another kitten of the same species which was being trained to eat cooked meat, which is popularly supposed to induce tame-ness, died in the same way. The animals perfectly well on the previous night, were found with the head enormously swollen next day and died very shortly.\n\nOn one or two occasions there was an outbreak of a very-infectious disease among the cats, a form of diarrhoea and weakness, the cats dying always with their mouths full of the grass of their bedding. At first the disease lasted two or three days before the fatal termination, but later became more rapid, and the last of the cats attacked died in a few hours after it first showed signs of illness. Cats were not rarely sent down from the Peninsula or neighbouring Islands in small cages with a putrid fowl in the cage for them to eat. When they arrived they were found to have a violent diarrhoea which soon killed them. Being usually very wild it was difficult to give them any medicine, as they could not be handled. They were dosed by dipping a stick wrapped in cloth into the medicine and presenting it to the cat which bit it furiously so that the medicine ran down its throat.\n\n*F. planiceps.*\n\nThe stump-tailed cat is a small grey and red cat with a thick blunt tail. It was formerly considered very rare, but at one time was one of the commonest cats sent to the gardens. It is usually a quiet cat, but I never saw one that was really tame. On one occasion a gentleman sent one which he said refused to eat and had eaten nothing for some days. I offered it fish and all kinds of tempting things, for it did not occur to me that the owner had never tried it with raw meat, but this proved to be the case, and when some raw beef was offered, it ate two pounds up as fast as it could. It is useless to try\nto feed wild cats or any carnivora with cooked meat, they will never touch it, until they have been gradually trained to it, nor will any of them drink milk, though they may be trained to do so, especially if quite young. It is perhaps as well to point out that all these cats, including tigers, require grass and should be supplied with it.\n\n**VIVERRIDAE.**\n\n*Viverra zibetha*, and *V. tangalunga*.\n\nThe two big grey civets are often brought in by Malays. They are very handsome beasts, but do not stand captivity well, as they are usually very nervous and dislike being looked at. They live best in darkened cages as they cannot stand a bright light. During the day they are generally very quiet, and are active only at night. They are never vicious though seldom tame. Their food consists of fruit and meat, but like all these animals should be fed chiefly on bananas, papayas and such fruit, with only a little meat. One of the Tangalungas escaped from captivity on one occasion and lived wild in the gardens for a long time. It usually concealed itself during the day, but was often seen by the watchmen at night wandering about. I came across it during the day on one occasion, when the dogs pursued it but were easily beaten off. Wild ones have also been seen in the gardens.\n\n*Paradoxurus hermaphroditus*.\n\nThe Musang. This is a very common animal, abundant in a wild state all over Singapore, and often inhabiting the roofs of houses. It is very easily kept in confinement and becomes very docile, especially when taken young, and can be trained to perform tricks, or to follow its owner about. It eats almost anything but lives chiefly on fruit. It does not appear to be a long lived animal, but it seldom suffers from any disease. Specimens brought by Malays however are very often injured in catching them. I have had one brought with its mouth sewn up with string, to prevent it biting. The string was quickly removed and the poor animal soon recovered its injuries. The common local form varies somewhat in\ncoloring, but comparatively small in size. The Javanese form, of which a specimen was presented to the Gardens in 1904, is a very different looking animal, much larger, with three distinct black stripes down its creamy white back.\n\n*P. agurus leucomystax.*\n\nThe white-whiskered Paradoxure. This is a rare beast of a light brown colour with orange eyes. Three were taken in Singapore one year, and two of these were brought to the gardens, one was injured by a dog bite in catching it, and eventually had to be killed. The other lived for over ten years. A very quiet animal sleeping nearly all day, and occasionally moving about slowly. It is not vicious but is less docile than the musang. It eats fruit, chiefly bananas, and seems to be a long lived animal. It requires a darkened cage, as it dislikes a bright light.\n\n*Arctogale leucotis.*\n\nThis pretty brown civet has been kept in the gardens for some time. It is very tame and is very fond of being stroked by visitors. One was sent to the London gardens in 1905.\n\n*Arctictis binturong.*\n\nThe bear-cat has often been on view in the gardens. It is easily tamed and very long lived. One remarkably fine one was kept for 16 years. Its food consists of bananas and pineapple. It will also eat meat, birds, dried fish, etc. It was also sent to the Zoological Gardens in London in 1905.\n\n*Herpestes mungo.*\n\nA common Indian mongoose lived for many years in the garden, and was believed to have been intentionally poisoned eventually by a native who had one to sell. It is often brought to Singapore by natives of India. The one kept was very tame and amusing and spent much of the day playing with the dogs, as it was allowed to run about. It was an excellent ratter, and a great snake-killer.\n\n*R. A. Soc., No. 46, 1906.*\nH. aureopunctatus.\n\nThe small Indian mongoose, is also often imported into Singapore, and two were kept for a long time. They were very tame and playful.\n\nH. brachyurus.\n\nThe water mongoose. Two of these have been kept for many years. One was presented by Dr. Johnstone who got it in Tringanu. The habits of this animal are very different from those of the two previous ones. It is never really tame nor is it at all playful. When annoyed it erects the bristles on its back whence probably the Malays call it Musang Babi. Its food is fish, but it is also partial to snakes.\n\nCyon rutilans.\n\nThe Malay wild dog. Two pairs of pups were kept for some time in the gardens, but one of the pair died soon after arrival, having been injured in catching, and the others were at different times poisoned out of spite by natives. This dog is a very handsome red animal with a beautifully plumed tail which when pleased it arches gracefully, but never wags it. It does not bark but makes a yapping noise. One used to spend much of its time rushing up the wooden partition of its cage for about 12 feet and dropping again to the ground. By bringing a terrier slut to the outside of its cage and stroking her the wild dog who evidently much admired her became tame enough to let me stroke it, and it was getting quite tame and very handsome when the native miscreant poisoned it. It is said that there are two kinds of wild dog in the Peninsula, one large and the other small, and this seems possible as one pair of pups were nearly as big as the last mentioned dog, though evidently very much younger.\n\nC. aureus.\n\nThe Indian Jackal. A pair of these was presented to the Gardens in 1895, and after a short time bred producing five pups. Of these one when very small crept through a small drain-hole into the tiger's cage next to its own cage and was\nseen no more. Sometime later one escaped and lived for a short time in low scrub off Holland Road, but at length disappeared. The others grew well for a year or two, but then all were attacked by distemper. All attempts to pull them through failed except in the case of one of the young ones which completely recovered and lived for many years till it was sold. I do not know if there is any other record of the Jackal having bred in captivity. In the Handbook of Animals kept in captivity in Calcutta Gardens it is stated that it has never been successfully bred there.\n\nThese Jackals are not rarely brought to Singapore from India by natives, and another was brought to the Gardens by an Indian on another occasion, but it was so much injured that I shot it at once. The natives say that Jackals never live long in Singapore as they always die of distemper here.\n\nC. Dingo.\n\nThe Dingo. A very handsome and tame Dingo of large size was presented to the menagerie in 1893. Though tame enough to be taken out for walks on the chain every day, it was unmanageable in sight of goats or chickens. When it was being brought to Singapore it used to run loose on the deck of the ship and play with the passengers but when two sheep escaped from the butcher's pen, the Dingo immediately dashed at them, and tore them to bits. During a spell of extremely hot weather he shed his thick coat and looked a very different animal. As he appeared to suffer much from the heat he was moved up to the stables as being cooler, but one night broke his rope and came upstairs into my house and lay down under the table whence nothing would induce him to move, and it was with great difficulty that he was taken back to his quarters. He did not attempt to bite or did he lose his temper but simply planted his feet on the floor and held on. The hot weather however was too much for him and he died a few days later.\n\nA white Dingo was also sent to the gardens from Perth, as a great rarity, but had to be sent back to Australia, as at the time of its arrival there was a hydrophobia panic in the\nStraits, and though the animal had never been outside a cage in its life, having been born in captivity, after due consideration the Government officials decided that a Dingo was a Dog and as a Dog could not be admitted to the colony. It was a curious looking animal of a rather dirty white colour, and quite young.\n\n*C. vulpes.*\n\nTwo foxes were kept in the Gardens at different times. One was brought from China and appeared somewhat different in colour from an ordinary English fox. It was very active, playing about like a kitten all day. It was allowed a romp on the chain every day for about half an hour which it much enjoyed, but on three occasions when it was allowed this treat after a day or two's intermission it became so excited that it had a fit, and on the third occasion it died in spite of all that could be done. The fox appears to be very liable to fits when young, as similar occurrences are recorded in the account of the animals in the Calcutta Gardens.\n\nThe other fox was larger and came from Russia. It lived a long time and was eventually sold. During the hot weather it shed great masses of matted hair, as the Dingo did. At one time it became of a curious grey colour for a short time, as if it was going to put on a white winter coat. Though tame enough to allow the keeper to enter its cage, it would not allow any one to handle it, but tried to bite. It became very friendly with the jackal and used to slip through the bars between the two cages to play with it.\n\n*Lutrid\u00e6.*\n\n*Lutra cinerea.*\n\nThe clawless otter lived for some time in the gardens. It was very tame, but like all others used to squeak incessantly for food. It ate fish and meat in great quantities, and eventually died suddenly from overfeeding. When its skin was taken off for stuffing at the museum it was found to be extremely fat, the fat on its tail being nearly an inch thick.\nL. Sumatrana.\n\nThe Malay otter. One full grown specimen of this otter caught in Singapore was bought for a dollar. It however died in a day or two, having doubtless been injured in capture. Another specimen much younger was on deposit for a time, it was quite tame and allowed itself to be handled. Like L. cinerea it squeaked and squealed all day if it saw anyone it thought might have something for it to eat.\n\nUrsid\u00e6:\n\nUrsus Malayanus.\n\nThe Honey bear has often been kept in the gardens. The finest was one known as \"Jelebu\" which was presented by Sir Cecil Clementi Smith. He was very good-natured and would play with anybody, allowing people to wrestle with him, ride on his back or put their hands into his mouth, and never putting forth his great strength so as to hurt. When he had a female given him as a companion, his games with her were much rougher. The two bears would seize each other's skin in their mouths and pull so violently that one would not have thought any skin would stand such rough treatment. He had the greatest aversion to bullocks and especially when he first came used to be perfectly rabid at the sight of one. Horses he took no notice of. On several occasions he broke the chain or collar by which he was attached and escaped at night, but he was easily recaptured, though he had wandered to the further end of the garden. A watchman whom he did not like turned the light of his lantern on him and Jelebu rushed at him. He ran towards the cage and gradually the bear was got up to the cage and put back again. But on later occasions when he got out of his cage he never went far but merely rambled round the other cages, climbed up a tree where he broke off some branches and made a nest which he sat in for a minute or two, and then came down again and was easily induced to return to his cage with the offer of some bread, which he was very fond of. When given anything liquid or juicy he always lay on his back to swallow it so that the juice of sugarcane for instance ran down his throat. On one occasion some sailors gave him\na bottle of beer which as he found it contained liquid, lie lay on his back to drink, after which he played with the bottle for some time, balancing it on his hind feet and tossing it about, and then suddenly jumping up and holding it in both paws returned it to the sailors to be filled up again, which created much amusement. He was very powerful and on one occasion broke an iron bar an inch through with ease, and could bite up an inch-plank as easily as a man could bite a piece of soft bread. I have seen trees in the forest with the trunks torn to splinters by wild bears in search of honey. This bear died of pneumonia during a season of influenza when several other animals succumbed. A large female formerly belonging to a resident was presented and given him as a companion. As is often the case in private houses this bear had been so teased by the Chinese servants that its temper was quite spoilt and it took a long time to get her tame again. It was hoped to breed from the pair, but the female suffered from an uterine disease for which nothing could be done, and which proved fatal. A small bear was put in the same cage with Jelebu, and the two were quite friendly for some time but a quarrel took place and the small bear was killed.\n\nThe Borneo variety was frequently also on view. It is rather smaller than the Malayan form. In its wild state the bear inhabits low swampy parts of the forests, where I have occasionally come across them, or heard them scurry off. It gives a kind of barking snort when annoyed, and when pleased or sucking its paws it makes a low humming noise. I have also heard near the caves at Kuala Lumpur a peculiar loud humming grunt often repeated which was said to be the cry of a bear which was fully three quarters of a mile away.\n\n*Melursus ursinus.*\n\nA sloth bear was kept for some time in 1875.\n\n**Rodentia.**\n\n*Ratufa bicolor.*\n\nSeveral color forms of this handsome squirrel have been kept. It lives well in captivity and becomes very tame. The\nscarcer brown form *R. affinis* was obtained for the price of a dollar from a Malay at Jurong. It was in very poor condition and died soon after.\n\n*Sciurus Finlaysoni* Horsf.\n\nA very small creamy white squirrel shaded with grey on the back was purchased many years ago from Siam, and lived here till 1905 when it was sold. It probably belonged to this species, but several naturalists who have seen it are doubtful as to what species it belonged to.\n\n*Sc. tenuis.*\n\nThe little Malay squirrel, very common in a wild state in the gardens, does not bear captivity well and soon dies.\n\n*Sc. Prevosti.*\n\nRaffles squirrel; makes a very nice pet, becoming quite tame and living long and happily in confinement. Many of these beautiful animals are brought to Singapore where they are sold at from a dollar or a dollar and a half upwards.\n\n*Sc. notatus.*\n\nThe brown Malay squirrel with a red belly is very common in the gardens. It bears captivity very well and soon becomes very tame. Specimens caught in the gardens were kept for many years.\n\n*Sc. sp.*\n\nA little grey three-striped squirrel said to have been brought from India, of which four or five were purchased, but not very long after all managed to escape through a hole. Some of them were seen some years afterwards roaming about the gardens, but seem now to have disappeared.\n\nSquirrels can be fed on ground nuts, Indian corn, etc. The chief danger to their life is due to intestinal worms, which often kills them. A betelnut put into the cage now and then prevents this as the squirrels will nibble it themselves and so get rid of the parasites. None have bred in confinement. Most of the kinds\nlive very happily together in one cage, so that they have a box nest for each one to sleep in. These squirrels make large nests of bastfibre, palmfibre etc., in the trees and are often troublesome in pulling off the cocoanut husk used in fixing orchids on the trees and throwing the orchid down on the ground. These nests are usually placed in the boughs of a tree or among the leaves of a pandanus, or sometimes low down among the thorny leaves of a Bromelia. One nest was made on the leaves beneath the office, and attention was called to it, by the cries of the young squirrels which had been attacked by an army of ants and had fallen from the nest. One had died, the other was put into a cigar-box up in a tree, where the mother squirrel had been heard calling. She quickly came and got into the box, but went away again. When however every one was gone from the building and all was quiet she returned and carried off the young one.\n\n*Rhizomys sumatrensis.*\n\nThe Bamboo rat has often been kept, and lives well, but as it can bite its way through most things requires an iron cage. Two lived for a long time in a wooden box lined with tin but eventually bit their way through the bottom, and nearly through the wooden floor before they were found out. One or two escaped and lived in clumps of bamboo for some time. They eat rice, nuts and such food, and also are fond of bamboo shoots to gnaw. The bamboo rat has a curious way of sleeping on its back which gives it the appearance of being dead.\n\n*Hystrix longicauda.*\n\nThe Porcupine, is still common in Singapore, and is very easily kept as a pet, eating sweet potatoes, tapioca etc., and some I have seen had a great liking for bones which they nibbled up. It is readily tamed and lives well in captivity. An albino, quite white with pink eyes was purchased some years ago, with it was a young one, normally colored. The young one was still sucking the mother though quite a large\nsized animal, and finally took to nibbling off its mother's quills so that it had to be separated. The white one was sent home in 1905 but died on the way.\n\nThe animal occurs occasionally still in a wild state in the gardens.\n\n*Atherura macrura.*\n\nThe Brush tailed porcupine has been on view in the menagerie twice, one was a very young one and soon contrived to escape. The other was an adult. I obtained it on the Siak river in Sumatra, and during the voyage down the river at night it contrived to escape from its cage and ran up and down the boat. It was easily detected in its attempt to hide, from the powerful muskey scent it exhaled which lasted for some time wherever it had run. It was soon recaptured and lived for some time in the gardens. I have several times come across the animal or its tracks in limestone caves but it also occurs in open country.\n\n*Mus decumanus varalbus.*\n\nWhite rats were kept on view for some time, and bred easily. They gradually however died out.\n\n*Cavia porcella.*\n\nGuinea pigs, were also kept, but suffer much during the wet season.\n\n**UNGULATES.**\n\nThe elephant has never been kept in the menagerie on account of expense.\n\n*Rhinoceros sumatrensis.*\n\nThree of these were kept temporarily before shipping to the Vienna Zoological Gardens in 1901 and there was one in the gardens as early as 1875. An account of one has been already published in the Journal.\n\n*Tapirus indicus.*\n\nThe Malay tapir. A young tapir, the property of the Director lived for many years in the gardens. When bought it had the\nblack and yellow spotting of the young stage, but after some years put on the black and white coloring of the adult. It was most active in the early morning and late evening. Most of its time it lived in the office or in the Director's house. When the office was opened at 6 o'clock, it would go out and browse along the road side and returning when the sun got hot would be in the office under the table most of the day. Its food consisted of boiled rice with salt, grass, bushes, sweet potatoes and fruit, and it would frequently seek for the abandoned bones which the dogs had left and bit them up. On Saturdays it came up to the Director's house for Sunday, as the office was closed on that day, and went back on Monday morning. There was no need to lead or drive it. When pushed out of the office it galloped of its own accord across the garden, choosing the direction where were the fewest paths as its feet were too soft for the gravel, and jumping all the paths it came to, returning on Monday in the same way. Like the rhinoceros it always dropped its excreta in the same spot each day, so there was no trouble about keeping it in the house.\n\nThe cryptic characters of this animal were well shown both in its young and old pelage. When in the former coloring on one occasion it went to sleep in a bush of palms, and when I went to fetch it in on opening the bush and looking down I could not see it. I seemed to be looking on the dark brown ground flecked with spots of sunlight through the leaves. The little animal lay in such a position that the yellow spots were exactly where the vertical sun rays would fall, the yellow streaks resembling the slanting streaks of light from the side. It was for a few minutes quite invisible, though I was looking down on it. The fur at this age is closer and more velvety than in the adult stage. The change is very rapid only taking a few days for the yellow spots to disappear the fur getting scantier and black and the greyish white coloring of the rump developing. It is not less well protected by its coloring when adult and at rest. In the dusk I have seen her sitting on the grass plot, the black fore parts invisible, the greyish white rump exactly resembling a rounded granite boulder, both in shape and colour; seeing it sitting like this with its rump towards me I\ncould not make out at first what it was as I knew there was no granite boulder on the grass plot.\n\nThis tapir was very docile and amusing and was a great attraction, very few people even the Malays ever having seen one before. It was easily trained to draw a small cart, but its feet were too soft for hard roads, and it could only walk comfortably on grass. When very happy it would canter and curvet on the grass neighing like a pony, but its ordinary cry especially if vexed was a whistle which it gave with its trunk. This whistle is the alarm cry which one hears when one comes across them in the forest. It had considerable climbing powers and often walked upstairs. When left alone in a room it sometimes got on a chair and then climbed on to a table. On one occasion when it did this the table which bore on it a pot of white paint, some gum, and ink, collapsed with the weight of the animal who was found standing in a pool of the mixed liquids and covered all over with paint, gum and ink. It was very fond of bathing and used to go down to the lake and remain under water for a considerable time digging in the mud with its paws.\n\nAs it got bigger it was found necessary to keep it in an enclosure as there were complaints that it alarmed horses when it was feeding along the road. When shut up, or kept in a stable the tapir here is very liable to pthisis, and this one did not escape. Except that one or two occasions it was heard to give a little cough, and that it got very lazy and also slightly thinner, it showed no signs of illness. But one day it was taken to have its swim in the lake which it much enjoyed and was unwilling to relinquish, and after it came out of the water it went to lie down under a tree as usual, and half an hour later was found to be dead. At the post-mortem the lungs were found to be badly diseased with pthisis, a considerable portion being destroyed. Two other full sized tapirs were temporarily deposited in the gardens, before shipping to Europe, and both died very suddenly with evident signs of severe colic. One which was opened was found to have the stomach full of some bitten up sweet stuff which was almost certainly pineapple, and there was little doubt that some one had given these animals a quantity of pineapples which had proved fatal.\nAnoa depressicornis.\n\nAn example of this interesting animal occasionally brought by Bugis boats from Celebes, was deposited in the gardens by the curator of the museum who had bought it to stuff. It was extremely tame, though occasionally it butted at the keeper when he went into its cage. It lived chiefly on bushes, and throve very well till it was killed for stuffing. Recently I saw a young one in one of the animal shops which was remarkable for being covered with red wool, instead of the smooth black brown hair of the adult.\n\nCervulus Muntjac.\n\nThe Kijang. This pretty animal lived and bred very readily in confinement. A pair was procured from Sumatra and they produced eight young all males. It was very remarkable to see how quickly the newborn Kijang developed. The births took place a little before daylight and the little one very soon was staggering about on its legs; by nine o'clock it could stand and walk about quite easily. Indeed on one occasion before seven a.m. a new born one succeeded in getting between the bars of the cage and running away to a wood near by, where it disappeared and was said to have been killed by a pariah dog. The Kijang is a very tame and quiet animal though the males occasionally tried to fight and had to be separated.\n\nTwo or three died during my absence in England from what cause I do not know. The others were sold. I believe this animal has never been successfully carried to England as it does not stand a sea-voyage well. Its food is bushes, boughs of waringin, and other trees, sweet potatoes and tapioca roots.\n\nIn my account of the Mammals of the Malay peninsula, I stated that it did not occur in Singapore. Since that time however I have seen one female caught at Jurong and heard of others in Bukit Timah and elsewhere.\n\nCervus unicolor.\n\nThe Rusa or Sambur. These were constantly kept and bred regularly in confinement but chiefly produced bucks.\nIndeed females are not so common in captivity as males. This may perhaps be due to the fact that the female is much more difficult to move about than the male, as it fights violently when attempts are made to catch it and often gets injured or dies of shock. It is curious that the deer which stands injuries from gunshot wounds etc. very easily is very apt to be injured fatally in catching and transhipping. A deer to be conveyed from place to place must never have its feet tied, as if this is done the animal will almost certainly die.\n\nThe Sambur buck when adult is often extremely dangerous, and will attack people in a ferocious manner when quite unprovoked. A very fine one which had been brought up from a fawn, on one occasion attacked a coolly from behind who was filling its watertank and threw him to the top of the fence whence he scrambled down, inflicting a number of stabs on his legs and thighs. On another occasion by breaking a bar it got into an enclosure with a black buck which it attacked and lifted and carried about on its antlers. The black buck was rescued and the deer driven back into the enclosure, but taking advantage of the tub of water between the two enclosures being removed, he managed by lying down and wriggling through the small space to get again into the black buck\u2019s enclosure and killed it by one stab through the liver.\n\nDeer in the tropics require a mudbath like a buffalo, and delight to wallow in it and cover themselves with mud. I have disturbed them at this refreshment in the forest in Singapore. They also require a dark house or stable to live in or otherwise they are pestered with flies. All attempts to stop this nuisance failed till the idea of making a perfectly dark stable in the enclosure occurred and this was found to be quite effective. The deer were quite free from the flies in the dark, and remained there most of the day. Even wild deer seem to be pestered in this manner. Once in Selangor I saw at a Sakai encampment, a pet doe, which lived loose in the woods and came out only when the Sakais called it and when they did so I observed that a number of these flies (one of the Muscas) came with it. A friend who was with me was anxious\nto buy this deer, but the Sakai woman would not hear of it as she had brought it up from Java on her own milk and it was one of the family. The deer eat cut grass, bushes, and paddy. The doe produces one young one at a time, which has a couple of white spots on the sides near the rump, which very soon disappear. A number of bucks were bred, and eventually the whole lot were disposed of. Deer suffer occasionally from wounds caused by their cutting their legs in the fences, or by fighting, and these wounds are not very easy to heal, and are liable to get flyblown if care is not taken. A disease resembling foot and mouth, killed several on one occasion and a large doe died after producing a fawn apparently of anaemia, for it was observed when her skin was taken off that she was almost bloodless.\n\n*C. hippelaphus.*\n\nThe Sumatran deer, a smaller beast with a golden coloring on the back and a habit of marching about with its head erect, has several times been on view. It is apt to be vicious and constantly tries to butt. It will not breed with the tambur, and has not been bred in the gardens menagerie. One, apparently an old beast, after several years went blind in both eyes with cataract and was eventually killed.\n\n*C. sp.*\n\nPhilippine deer; one or more species of Philippines deer have been kept in captivity for some years at different dates, but those which have been kept within the last few years were too young to identify specifically.\n\n*C. axis.*\n\nThe spotted deer. Formerly often kept in the Straits by Chinese and others, seems to live well. The only one presented to the gardens of late years expired shortly after arrival owing to its legs having been tied.\n\n*Antilope cervicapra.*\n\nThe Black buck. This Indian animal has twice been kept, specimens having been presented by various regiments coming\nfrom India. They live well in the Straits, eating grass, paddy etc.\n\nOne belonging to one of the regiments proved a nuisance by suddenly charging the men from behind, and when it had damaged eight in this manner, it was sent to the gardens. It was otherwise very quiet and tame. It was killed by a sambur deer as described previously.\n\n*Tragulus napu.*\n\nThe large mouse deer often trapped by Malays has been constantly kept in enclosures. These animals had a habit of sitting almost motionless in a corner of their enclosure so that after a time large bony calli appeared on the legs at the joints. This was stopped by giving them a large soft ground enclosure, where there being several together they exercised themselves and lived and bred. Many that are brought in by the Malays are injured by having the sharp canine teeth broken off so as to prevent their biting and from that and other rough handling the poor animals frequently succumb. They eat spinach, sweet potatoes etc. In making their enclosure it is necessary to sink the palings in the ground for some depth as these animals can dig their way out beneath if it is not deep enough. On one occasion I purchased three Napus at Changi, one old and two young ones, which a Malay had had a long time, and brought them down in the same box they had always lived in but while waiting for about half an hour till an enclosure was got ready for them, unexpectedly the old female attacked the young ones and bit off their noses and ears, killing them, what provoked this maniacal attack I could not guess.\n\n*T. javanicus.*\n\nThe Kanchil, resembles the Napu but is smaller and brown-er. It is about as common but less frequently brought into captivity, probably being more delicate and easily injured.\n\n*T. stauleyanus.*\n\nIs a Pelandok, as big as the Napu but of a bright foxy red. Its locality is said to be Rhio, but the species is only known\nfrom specimens imported into Singapore by natives. Its habits in confinement are those of the Napu. It has several times been on view.\n\n*Sus cristatus.*\n\nThe wild boar. Does not live at all well in captivity young ones have been brought several times to the gardens but soon died. The only one that I ever saw kept well as a pet was at a house in Selangor where it ran about the garden loose. I have seen Chinese pigs which had been allowed to cross with wild pigs in the forest the young of which did as well as ordinary pigs. There seems to be some doubt as to whether this species is identical with the Indian pig. It is still abundant in Singapore and some years ago a large wild boar invaded the gardens, and remained in the garden jungle for some days. A hunt was organized for it but it had got away before.\n\n**Edentata.**\n\n*Manis javanica.*\n\nThe scaly anteater is common in Singapore and has occasionally been caught in the gardens. It lives underground all day coming out of its burrows at night, when it is caught. It has often been on view for a few days in the garden's menagerie, but is impossible to keep. Its great strength and powers of digging make it difficult to retain in ordinary enclosures and it refuses to eat anything but termites, chopped meat and eggs which others of the order eat readily it will not touch. Adults and young ones of both sexes have been kept for a few days only. The young ones are very curious being pink, and climbing about their mother in an odd way.\n\n**Marsupialia.**\n\nA number of Australian marsupials have been on view at different times, but the records and identifications of many have not been preserved. Kangaroos were kept as early as 1875 and among the species on view later were *Macropus giganteus*.\nand *M. rufus*, and *? ualabatus*, and several smaller species were also kept. Kangaroos do not thrive in this country on account of the damp which appears to cause diarrhoea. Two very fine black Wallabies were sent by Mr. Le Souef from the Perth Gardens in Australia. They arrived in the wet season, and though most carefully housed and fed on dry food, both died in a few days from diarrhoea. The smaller Kangaroo rats lived much longer. One however a charming little animal the day after it came in hopping about the cage at night must have overlooked the wire fencing and struck its head against it. It was found partly paralyzed next morning and though it lived for some time all pains taken with it produced no improvements and it eventually died. Three common Dasyures (*Dasyurus Geoffroyi*) lived for some time, but the climate did not seem to suit them well. A fine Cuscus, *Phalangista ursinus* was presented to the gardens some years ago, but owing to the long voyage it suffered from diarrhoea and it succumbed shortly. The Australian opossum, *Trichosurus vulpecula* proved the easiest marsupial to keep. A pair presented in 1898 which had long lived in captivity and were quite old lived long in the gardens and bred regularly. They were only lively at night, sleeping most of the day. Though the old pair were very friendly to each other, they occasionally got up little squabbles about places on a perch or food, and after swearing at each other would curl up together and go to sleep. Nearly all suffered sooner or later from ulceration of the tip of the tail, which was treated with idoform, and usually healed readily, though the tip often died off.\n\n**Birds.**\n\nThe record of the large number of birds of different kinds kept in the aviaries is very incomplete, as owing to difficulties in identifying them in the early days, they were often simply recorded by simple names, such as parrots, pigeons, etc. No attempt was made to keep insectivorous birds as there was no means of properly feeding them, and the expense of keeping a cooly to catch insects for them would have been too great. The gardens themselves abound in birds of all kinds which\nfind there a refuge from the shooter and trapper, and some account of those observed was published by the author in Natural Science.\n\nThe following is as complete a list of what have been kept in the aviaries as can be procured.\n\n**ORIOLID\u00c6.**\n\n*Oriolus xanthonotus* Horsf.\n\nMalay Oriole, presented by the Duke of Newcastle, lived for some time.\n\n**EULABID\u00c6.**\n\n*Eulabes intermedia* Hav.\n\nThe Tiong. Common in a wild state and occasionally nesting in the gardens.\n\n*Acridotheres* sp.\n\nJavanese Mynah, a very tame little bird, which readily talks. It lived for many years, and was eventually killed by a rat.\n\n**ALCEDINID\u00c6.**\n\n*Halcyon smyrnensis.*\n\nA bird of what I think was this species was brought alive having been caught in a spider's web. It was very restless and found impossible to keep alive.\n\n**PASSERINI.**\n\n*Padda oryzivora.*\n\nJava sparrow. Was introduced to the gardens many years ago under the impression that it was insectivorous and established itself there. This graminivorous bird was distributed to various parts of the peninsula where it has settled down but never goes far from where it was first turned out.\n\n**BUCEROTID\u00c6.**\n\n*Buceros Rhinoceros.*\n\nThe Rhinoceros Hornbill. One or two were kept at different times.\nAuthracoceras malabaricus.\nCraniorrhinus corrugatus.\nAnorrhinus galeritus.\n\nThese Hornbills live on fruit, bread and small birds. They were very fond of mice. One was very clever at catching sparrows when they flew through its cage. It would play with its victim for a time and then swallow it. They are apt to die very suddenly from no distinct cause.\n\nPsittaci.\n\nLorius domicella.\nL. flavopalliatus.\nL. garrulus.\n\nA number of these gay coloured birds are brought by the Bugis men for sale.\n\nCacatua galerita.\n\nThe Sulphur crested Cockatoo was frequently kept.\n\nC. moluccensis.\n\nLarge Cockatoo. One specimen lived for upwards of twenty years and is still alive.\n\nC. sulphurea.\n\nLesser sulphur crest kept in 1880.\n\nC. rosacea.\n\nRosy Cockatoo, has been kept for some time.\n\nPal\u00e6ornis longicanda.\n\nThe common parrakeet, does not live well in captivity. It is common wild in the gardens.\n\nCalopsitta nov\u00e6 hollandi\u00e6.\n\nLived well for some time.\n\nEclectus viridis, E. pectoralis and E. linn\u00e6i.\n\nThe Eclecti are often brought by Bugis men.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 46, 1906.\nEos fuscata.\n\nPsittinus incertus Shaw.\n\nThe Pialing, is rather a dull stolid bird, sitting perched on the top of a stick the whole day.\n\nTrichoglossus cyanogramma.\n\nLoriculus galgulus.\n\nThe Serindit lives best in a small cage of rattan. It is a quiet little bird, chiefly attractive for its curious way of sleeping suspended by its claws to the top of the cage with its head hanging down like a bat.\n\nGALLIN\u00c6.\n\nPavo muticus.\n\nThe Malay pea-fowl, has several times been kept. Young birds are very difficult to keep, but full grown birds live well. One or two used to wander loose in the gardens, but disappeared either killed by musangs or stolen by natives. One very fine peacock was found dead in its cage one morning, with a punctured wound near the eye. This it was surmised was caused by a blow from the beak of pheasant which lived in the next cage.\n\nArgasianus argus.\n\nThe argus pheasant and the Borneo-Argus have both been kept. The argus pheasants do not live well in captivity.\n\nPolyplectron bicalcaratum.\n\nPeacock pheasant, was in the aviary as early as 1875 but of late years none were obtained.\n\nNumida meleagris.\n\nThe Guinea fowl lived for a number of years, and one at least must from its appearance have been very old when it died.\n\nGallus varius.\n\nJavanese wildfowl. Cock birds lived well and long, hens seemed more delicate.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nG. atroviolaceus.\n\nThis beautiful chicken was described by Lieut. Kelsall from specimens brought to Singapore from an unknown locality. Another pair was seen brought in for sale in one of the animal shops, but it has not been seen since. It lived for some time in the gardens. Its habitat is not known.\n\nG. bankiva vars.\n\nJapanese fowl have been on view, and also several monstrous chickens with three or four legs. One cock had an extra half pelvis and complete leg, and a hen had two legs projecting out straight behind it. Another curious monstrosity was a cock which walked so erect that its tail touched the ground between the legs. These monstrosities, by no means rare in the east, are very attractive to natives, quite a large number were brought to the earlier agricultural shows in Penang.\n\nPhasianus Reevesi.\n\nReeves Bartail pheasant.\n\nEuplocamus Veilloti.\n\nOften obtained; a handsome long lived bird.\n\nE. Horsfieldi.\n\nE. nycthemerus.\n\nThe silver pheasant. Lived well for some years.\n\nE. proelatus.\n\nSiamese pheasant. This beautiful bird did not live long as it was killed by a rat not long after it was obtained.\n\nE. nobilis.\n\nBorneo Fireback (1880).\n\nThaumalia picta.\n\nGolden pheasant.\n\nAcomus erythrophthalmus.\n\nRufous tailed pheasant. This handsome bird lives easily and long.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 46, 1906.\nRollulus roul-roul.\n\nThe green partridge lives tolerably well, but is very shy concealing itself in its box at the sight of visitors. They are liable to the attacks of a bird louse which crowd round the head and neck and seem always if neglected to prove fatal. The same parasite attacks and kills calaenus nicobarica.\n\nCaccabis chukar.\n\nThe Indian partridge presented lived for a year or two.\n\nRhizothera longirostris.\n\nThe large partridge lives long and well. On one occasion a couple which had been kept in cages apart for a long time by a resident was presented to the gardens, as they were of different sexes and always calling to each other, it was assumed that they would live happily together but shortly after having been put into the same enclosure, on the absence of the keeper, the cock bird attacked the female and so pecked its head that it died.\n\nCoturnix sp.\n\nThe button quail is brought in large numbers from India for food, but did not thrive when put into an open enclosure, as they seemed to suffer from damp.\n\nCoturnix communis.\n\nCommon quail was in the aviaries in 1880.\n\nRALLID\u00c6.\n\nErythra phoenicurus.\n\nThe common water rail is frequently caught as it not rarely flies into houses at night attracted by the light, most so caught lived but a short time but some presented by Mr. Down lived long, and some are still living. It is common in a wild state in the garden where it often nests.\n\nPorphyrio Edwardsi.\n\nThe purple coot, lived a very long time in captivity. The feet of these birds are apt to get swollen if the floor of the cage is of stone or cement.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nP. sp.\n\nFrom China. A dull blackish coot often kept as a pet by Chinese. Three birds have been presented, but two were killed and swallowed by a Python which found its way into the cage. I failed to identify this species.\n\nCHARADRID\u00c6.\n\nNumenius phoeopus.\n\nThe Whimbrel. A specimen sent from Egypt lived but a short time.\n\nPELECANID\u00c6.\n\nPelecanus Philippinensis.\n\nThe grey pelican, has lived long in captivity. One specimen was caught in the harbour.\n\nP. roseus.\n\nA single bird was sent from the museum, which had been brought in by a Chinaman who had wounded it with a full charge of shot in the back. Of this injury it recovered completely in a few weeks and became a very fine bird. It was eventually sent to the museum again.\n\nP. sp.\n\nTwo of these birds were found being carried about in a rickshaw by a Chinaman, who had missed the owner. The police sent them to the aviary where they remained for a long time, and were never claimed.\n\nFREGATID\u00c6.\n\nAttagen minor.\n\nThis rather rare frigate bird lived long in captivity, but was finally killed by an adjutant who shared its cage and with whom it was on good terms. Some quarrel arose between the birds when no one was by and the adjutant broke the skull of the frigate bird with a blow of its beak.\nA. sp.\n\nA specimen bought for five dollars from a Malay in 1904 is still alive. These birds are the easiest of the sea birds to keep in captivity.\n\nSULID\u00c6.\n\n*Sula fiber.*\n\nThe brown booby lived a long time in captivity. It was found that after a time in its enclosure its feet became stiff and it could not walk. This was cured easily by allowing it at intervals to swim in the lake with a string attached to it, which it much enjoyed.\n\n*Leptoptilus Argala.*\n\nThe Indian adjutant. One example of this bird was kept for some time.\n\n*L. javanica.*\n\nThe common adjutant. This bird is very long-lived and one has been in captivity for over 20 years, as no one seems to know when it came. Most of the birds brought in have been wounded by shot and the old one had its wing broken and never repaired. One which was sent to the gardens appeared to be in excellent condition but refused to eat, and died in a couple of days. It was found to have received a complete charge of shot in the abdomen. The adjutants eat meat, fish, rats and any vermin.\n\nANATID\u00c6.\n\n*Cygnus alor.*\n\nWhite swans were kept for many years on the lake but both of the two last disappeared and were supposed to have been stolen.\n\n*C. atratus.*\n\nThe Australian black swan has always been kept on the lake and not rarely bred, making a large nest of rotten leaves fished up from the bottom of the lake by the cock bird which\nthrew them to the hen who arranged them by stamping on them with her feet. The young birds however were often destroyed by eagles and hawks. When a pair of swans occupied the lake they would not allow a new comer there but chased it off. They often left the lake to crop the grass on the grass plots, and one while crossing the road was run over by a carriage and its leg nearly cut off. The leg had to be removed, and the swan recovered and lived for many years, and though it could no longer walk as before, it used to wriggle along on its belly on the grass plots and so get the grass it liked.\n\nTwo were killed and eaten by a large python, on two successive months. On the occasion of the second disappearance of the swan a hunt was organised and the python 18 feet long was found on the Island in the lake and shot with the swan still inside it. The head of the swan had been crushed by the jaws of the snake, but the body was entire, giving the snake a remarkable appearance reminding one of a Plesiosaurus.\n\n*Dendrocygna javanica*\n\nThe whistling teal, was constantly kept on the lake and used to nest, and rear young which however were often destroyed by eagles and kites. At one time when there was a crocodile in the lake, the teal used to roost each night on the leaves of the *Victoria Regia* water lily, and frequently laid eggs there. Though the wings of these ducks were cut at first so that they could not fly they used commonly to take long flights when the feathers grew again, and they could not be recaptured, and either flew far away or fell victims to would-be sportsmen.\n\n*Nettopus coromandelianus.*\n\nThe goose teal, used for many years to frequent the lake in the spring, but would only remain a few weeks on passage.\n\n*Aix sponsa.*\n\nMandarin Duck a pair was presented to the gardens but did not live long.\n\nR. A. Soc. No. 46, 1906\nAnas boschas var.\n\nThree Bali ducks were for a long time on the lake having been presented by Mr. Balfour Lees. The peculiarity of this bird consists of its curious erect habit when walking. It stands as erect as a penguin, whence it is often known as the penguin duck. A number of ducks of different kinds were sent on one occasion from Egypt, of these only two arrived alive, a widgeon (Mareca penelope) and a tufted duck, Fuligula cristata both were put on the lake, but remained there but a short time, and then disappeared.\n\nSTRIGES.\n\nKetupa javanensis Lam.\n\nThe Fishing owl. These are very long-lived owls and those in the gardens have been there 16 or more years.\n\nBubo orientalis.\n\nWas on view several times.\n\nNinox scutulata.\n\nThe little Hawk owl lives but a short time in captivity.\n\nScops bakkamaenus.\n\nThis and one or two other small owls were kept for a short time.\n\nAsio accipitrinus.\n\nThe short-eared owl. One caught in Singapore (the only one recorded from the peninsula) lived for some time in the gardens.\n\nACCIPITRES.\n\nHieratus pennatus.\n\nA pair of these were found fighting in the gardens and a coolly caught one under his coat. It was transferred apparently none the worse to a cage in which was a large Sea-eagle. On being fed, the little eagle left its own piece of meat and tried to rob the Sea-eagle, who resisted and caught the small bird by the wings. It was quickly rescued, and transferred to another cage where it rearranged its plumage, erected its crest\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nand seemed quite happy. Next morning after being fed it fell dead. At the post mortem examination it was found that the liver and other viscera had been cut through in several places during the first fight. Though it had showed no signs of any injury till its sudden death.\n\n*Lophiotriorchis Kieneri.*\n\nThis beautiful bird was caught attacking the pigeons of a resident who sent it to the aviary, but not long afterwards owing to the carelessness of a cooly it escaped.\n\n*Spizaetus Horsfieldi.*\n\nHorsfield\u2019s Eagle is common in Singapore. This fine black Eagle has often been caught but never seems to get tame, constantly dashing against the wires of its cage.\n\n*Haliaetus leucoryphus.*\n\nMace\u2019s Sea Eagle. A specimen was kept for very many years, how long was not known. It showed signs of great age, and in trying to bathe in too small a tank injured its wing. The wound refused to heal and the bird had to be killed.\n\n*H. leucogaster.*\n\nThe common Sea-Eagle, has been caught several times in the gardens and by residents and kept in the aviaries for a long period. It lives very well in captivity.\n\n*Haliaastur indus.*\n\nBrahminy Kite. Often caught young, and has lived for many years.\n\n*Spilornis bacha.*\n\nA common hawk has often been presented to the gardens and lived fairly long.\n\n*Accipiter virgatus.*\n\nThe common Sparrow-hawk, has been often caught and kept. It has been captured close to the aviary pouncing on a grass lizard. It is very restless in captivity dashing against the bars of the cage and seldom lives long.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 46, 1906.\nCOLUMB\u00c6.\n\nOsmotreron vernans.\nThe green pigeon can never be kept long in confinement as it refuses to feed.\n\nCarpophaga oenea.\nThe Pergam, lives well and long.\n\nC. insularis.\nThis pretty pigeon from the Nicobars lives easily but is seldom procurable.\n\nC. whartoni.\nThe Christians Island pigeon is difficult to keep as it refuses most kinds of food.\n\nC. sylvatica.\nIndian fruit Pigeon kept in 1880.\n\nMyristicivora bicolor.\nThe Rawei. This beautiful black and white pigeon well in captivity.\n\nCalaenas nicobarica\nA pretty bird easily kept. It is a very quiet bird hardly moving about. At night, it seems to be more lively and some kept at the Director's house always made a kind of cooing noise at about 9 o'clock at night. It is often brought by natives to Singapore. It feeds chiefly on paddy.\n\nChalcophaps indica.\nA number of these pretty pigeons were put in a cage in the aviary, but owing to the fall of a bit of board all escaped. They however settled down in the gardens where they may be often seen.\n\nColumbia livia.\nRock-pigeon kept in 1880.\nButreron capelli.\n\nFive of these birds were sent from Johore in 1905, but refused to feed.\n\nGoura coronata.\n\nThe Victoria crowned pigeon, lives very well in captivity. Some obtained about 1875 lived for about 16 years. Of two presented later one died of some disease resembling gapes which at that time was very prevalent among domestic fowls.\n\n*Turtur tigrina* and *Geopelia striata* are both very common in the Gardens in a wild state.\n\nMacropygia assimilis.\n\nTwo examples of this brown pigeon were kept in 1880.\n\n**Laridae.**\n\nA large gull, perhaps the glaucous gull Larus was received with other birds from Egypt and lived for some years. Although it ate fish, it chiefly lived towards the end of its life on bananas, which it evidently much preferred.\n\n**Phoenicopteri.**\n\n*Phoenicopterus roseus.*\n\nThe flamingo. Several of these birds were received from Egypt, and were put in an enclosure on the lake but they were attacked by the large water turtles, (*Trionyx*) with which the lake was infested and some being killed, the others were removed to an enclosure in the aviary, but they did not thrive and all died.\n\n**Ibidae.**\n\n*Ibis melanocephalus.*\n\nThe black-headed Ibis, was presented in 1903, it was in young plumage but shortly developed its white feathers and dusky head. It is still alive.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 46, 1906.\nArdeid\u00e6.\n\nArdea sumatrana.\n\nThe large blue heron two of these birds have lived for a very long time in the Gardens, one about 20 years. The second about 15. This latter was caught young at Changi and brought up by Malays. It used to go to fish along the sea-coast every day and return to the house at night. This heron makes a strange booming noise constantly, holding its head erect and dilating its throat. The female has laid eggs several times in the aviaries but the rats have usually destroyed them.\n\nBubulons coromandus.\n\nThe Cattle egret lives well and long in captivity. One has been kept since 1892, another was obtained later. I have seen them kept as pets by the Akits a race of Sumatrans who live on rafts in the Siak river, and catch fish. This bird produces its beautiful egret feathers once a year in spring and they can be easily removed when ready to shed without injury to the bird. The two birds were at one time put into the same cage but fought viciously, one receiving some damage to its head.\n\nCiconid\u00e6.\n\nDissemurus episcopus.\n\nThis handsome stork was represented by two young birds sent from Pahang which lived and grew very well in confinement till they attained their full coloring. They were both killed by a curious accident. A swarm of bees took up its abode in the bushes close to the aviary, and as they were troublesome, the coolies attempted to destroy the comb. The bees flew about the aviary in swarms but none of the birds took any notice of them except the storks which snapped at them, and some of the bees getting into their mouths stung them in the throat and both died the following day.\n\nNycterinia Jabiru.\n\nThe Jabiru two of these fine birds were presented in 1899 and lived for some years when one died. The other is still living.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nTwo white Indian storks were presented in 1901, one of which had its beak so bent by some accident that it could not feed itself, and had to be fed by hand. A temporarily employed keeper unaware of this did not do so and the bird eventually died. The other is still living.\n\n**RATIT\u00c6.**\n\n*Dromaeus Nov\u00e6-Hollandi\u00e6.*\n\nThe Emu. These birds were kept from 1875 onwards. One pair in the Gardens bred in 1892 and the female laid one egg, unfortunately broken by accident by the male. Not long afterwards the male accidentally got his neck caught in the woodwork of his cage and though released quickly died in a few minutes perhaps from shock. The female was sold some years later.\n\n*Casuarius uniappendiculatus.*\n\nA female of this rare Ceram Cassowary was presented in 1891, and died in 1905 apparently of old age. It lived on bread, sweet-potatoe and the cobs of maize after the squirrels had eaten the grains off them.\n\n*C. sp.*\n\nFive young birds from New Guinea were purchased some years ago, and kept in an enclosure, but had to be separated as they fought. They were eventually sold.\n\n**REPTILES.**\n\n*Trionyx cartilagineus.*\n\nThe water turtle, caught in the lake lived many years. It is not only carnivorous, living on fish and frogs, but eats also paddy and boiled rice made up into balls. They evidently breed in the lake, as they became abundant at one time and killed the flamingos by biting their legs. They were caught by a large wire trap with a falling door baited with dead birds.\n\n*Testudo emys.*\n\nThe large Malay land tortoise. One was caught by myself in Johor, another in the Dindings and a third was presented\nto the Gardens. They ate kang kong (*Ipomea aquatica*). They lived long and were eventually sold.\n\n**Testudo amboinensis.**\n\nThe common box-tortoise, chiefly specimen, caught in Singapore, lived well eating kang-kong. These animals used not rarely to lay eggs, 2 at a time, very large for the size of the animal, oblong white with very hard thick shells. They deposited them in a corner of the enclosure and partly covered them with sand. None were ever hatched.\n\n**Daimonia subtrijuga.**\n\nThe Siamese tortoise presented by Capt. Flower, lived but a short time and would not feed. It was discovered later that it ate exclusively a blue mussel, un procurable in Singapore.\n\n**Geomyda spinosa** Gray.\n\nThe red jungle tortoise, common on Bukit Timah, lived easily in captivity. It eats leaves of kang kong etc. I have found it eating agaries in the forests.\n\n**Cyclemys platynota** Gray.\n\nThe flatbacked tortoise, caught in Singapore, is a dull dirty looking tortoise which spends almost all its time under the water.\n\n**Chelone imbricata.**\n\nThe Hawk\u2019s bill turtle. A number of small ones were presented to the gardens, but lived a short time only, as apparently the fresh water was not suitable for them and their feet became diseased. A larger one was obtained later, which its former owner said refused food of all kinds. It was found that it could not eat whole fish but if they were cut into bits it ate them. It lived for some months only, swimming very briskly about its tank but it appears these animals require sea water.\n\nJour, Straits Branch\nCrocodilus porosus.\n\nThe common crocodile, is easily procured and easily kept. One brought to the gardens and left tied up for a short time managed to escape into the lake where it grew to a length of 6 or 7 feet, and became troublesome, destroying the waterfowl and eventually commenced trying to seize the coolies drawing water. All kinds of methods were resorted to destroy it. It was twice wounded with shot, and both arsenic and strychnine were administered to it in chickens. Attempts were made to net it, and to catch it with hooks and bamboo spikes fastened to chickens and also to destroy it with dynamite. All proved unsuccessful, and finally the lake was drained nearly dry and attempts made to find and shoot or spear it, but it concealed itself in the mud, and during the night escaped from the lake and was never seen or heard of again. Another was kept in a tank for a considerable time, and became tame enough to come to the side whenever it was called, but was always vicious when the keeper entered the enclosure. On one occasion a visitor thrust a stick into its mouth which broke and a portion lodged transversely across its throat. This was with some difficulty extracted, but caused an abscess behind the base of the ramus of the jaw which penetrated through causing a large hole from the outside into its throat. The animal refused food for a few days, and the wound commenced to heal and in a surprizingly short time the damage was quite repaired. The crocodile lived till it was sold in 1904.\n\nHydrosaurus salvator.\n\nThe Biawak or Monitor has often been kept. It is common in Singapore, and one was actually caught in a godown in the town, having apparently come up a drain from the river. It was in a very poor starved condition. This lizard attains a very large size and is destructive to poultry. A large one living near the lake killed some Siamese teal and a black swan in 1888 before it was destroyed. One of no great size which had escaped from a cage nearly caused the death of the cooly who recaptured it. It had climbed up a tree, and he ascended the tree and noosed it with a string noose on a stick, but when he\njerked it from its hold it fell and as it did so struck him with its sharp claws on the ankle, cutting an artery from which he nearly bled to death. The Biawak eats meat, fish, frogs, rats, etc., when given a rat it shakes it violently like a dog, and then crushes the body from head to tail in its jaws till all the bones are broken when it swallows it whole, head first, when defending itself it slashes about with its long wiry tail, inflicting sharp blows. In captivity the animal constantly pushes its nose against the wire netting so that after being in confinement for some time most of them have the skin of the nose rubbed away. It much enjoys lying in a water tank, though it does very well without one. This animal lays its eggs in holes of no great depth in sandy places. I have seen quite a number so engaged.\n\n**OPHIDIL**\n\nThough many kinds of the smaller snakes are abundant in Singapore and often caught in or near the gardens, few have been kept for any length of time in the aviaries, on account of the absence of a proper house for them. Glass boxes such as are used in most menageries are very hot, unless put in a properly cool house, and feeding these small snakes requires a supply of frogs and mice which would entail an extra cooly to catch them. Some of them have been kept for a short time after capture and later sent to the Museum or given away to collectors.\n\nThe following were on view from time to time.\n\n*Dipsadomorphus dendrophilus.*\n\n*D. Cynodon.*\n\n*Chrysopelaea ornata.*\n\n*Dryophis prasina.*\n\n*Bungarus fasciatus.*\n\nThis poisonous snake was kept for some time. It is very handsome with its black and yellow rings, but very vicious readily striking at any one. It has a habit of rapidly beating\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nits tail on the ground when annoyed, making a rattling sound, apparently as a warning. *Callophis gracilis*. Also a poisonous snake does the same. The specimen exhibited came from Pahang.\n\n*Naia tripudians.*\n\nThe black cobra a common snake in the gardens has often been exhibited, but seldom lives long in captivity. Many possibly were injured in capture. It does not feed very readily in captivity, but will eat mice and small birds, and frogs. Its habit of spitting its venom into the eyes of people approaching too near it makes it a dangerous animal to keep in a close wire cage, and it seemed to suffer from heat in a glass box.\n\n*N. bungarus.*\n\nThe Hamadryad. Small specimens caught in the gardens were exhibited on several occasions. One was caught eating a small python, and transferred to a cage but it refused to continue its meal, and others obtained refused to feed though snakes, eggs, mice, frogs and other food was offered.\n\nThis snake is now apparently rare in Singapore, none have been brought in for a long time. The last I saw was a moderately large one brought in a box by two little Malay boys who had caught it near the Barracks. They had no idea it was a dangerous snake.\n\n*Lachesis Wagleri.*\n\nThe green viper. This has often been exhibited being a common and handsome snake, beautifully marked with black, yellow, green and prussian blue. It lives well in captivity and also breeds, producing 5 to 9 young at a time. As of course is well known to most people, the young are born free and not deposited in the form of eggs. The green viper eats rats of quite large size, birds, lizards and frogs. There is always a little difficulty in rearing young ones, as they require very small lizards for their food which are difficult to catch but some have been brought up. It is a quiet snake lying quite still on a branch for hours together. On two occasions coolies\nin the gardens have been bitten by young green vipers which had fallen from a tree and been stepped on. The bite is not fatal but gives a good deal of pain for a few hours, the inflammation being about as bad as that of a scorpion sting. A native who possessed a large pariah dog, allowed a very large fresh-caught green viper to bite the dog on the thigh. A dog uttered a shriek and ran away, returning quite well in about two hours and none the worse. A sparrow was put into the cage of a green viper and flew about taking no notice of the snake, till the viper suddenly struck it on the thigh, and the blood immediately flowed. The bird flew away to the end of the cage but did not seen at all affected by the poison. The snake followed it up and struck at it again seizing its head in its mouth and crushing it at once. As had the bird been free it could easily have flown out of the snakes reach before the snake caught it again, the action of the poison does not appear to be of much value to the reptile.\n\n**Python curtus.**\n\nThe little red python, a short thick red and grey snake formerly considered very rare is not at all uncommon in the forests of Bukit Timah, and has often been exhibited. It is a sluggish snake unless it means to strike which it does with lighting like rapidity. It feeds on rats and mice and will take milk occasionally. It only requires feeding once a month as a rule.\n\n**Python reticulatus.**\n\nThe Python is one of the commonest snakes in Singapore. And specimens of every size up to 26 feet long have been constantly exhibited in the aviaries. Very large ones have also been seen and killed also in a wild state in the gardens, and small one have occasionally found their way into the aviary cages and devoured some of the birds, and being afterwards unable to escape by the small hole by which they entered were captured on the following morning. Like many snakes the python is nocturnal remaining quiet all day and going out in search of food at night. Young pythons eat rats and birds, and small to middle sized pythons are common visitors\nto fowl houses where they often kill more fowls than they eat. One of about 12 or 15 feet brought to the gardens for sale was said to contain no less than 12 ducks. Large pythons in the forest live on deer, pigs and other game of that kind. Small sized pythons usually feed once a month. The large ones over 20 feet long, usually once in from six to nine months. One which was about 22 feet long, not long after it was brought in passed the remains of a deer. It fed again some time later on three chickens, and remained without food for six months when it passed the remains of the fowls and then ate a good sized pariah dog, which lasted it for 9 months. There is very little difficulty in inducing the python to live on dead food, though naturally they kill their own prey. At first however they not rarely refuse a dead chicken or rat. Live animals such as fowls if put into a cage with a python are never alarmed at it, at least until it moves about; the fowls perch on the snake and clean their feathers, the rats burrow down among the coils of the snake and seem quite contented. The mythical fascination of the reptile does not exist except in poetical imagination. If the python is hungry\u2014he usually stretches himself, looks fixedly at his prey which take no notice whatever of them. There is a rapid motion of the head and fore part of the snake, so rapid that it is impossible to see what happens, and the prey is encircled by a coil and a half of the snake\u2019s neck with its head firmly held and crushed in its mouth. The stroke is one of the most rapid things I have seen, and it is impossible for the prey to be killed quicker in any way.\n\nIf the food is dead he examines it carefully all over and taking it in his coils pushes it head first into his mouth. All snakes I believe swallow the prey head first, and I found once in a wood in Selangor a curious frog so marked that its tail end looked like the head. So that if a snake came and attempted to seize the frog by what was apparently its head, the frog at one spring would be out of the way. The python, especially large ones, only feed at night, and they shew signs of hunger by restlessly moving about the cage. They much object to being looked at or annoyed during their slow swallowing of the prey, and if disturbed will reject the food even if partially swallowed.\nand will not feed again. Almost any snakes of any size will eat smaller ones. I have seen *Doliophis trivirgatus* eating a small brown snake, and the python will also occasionally do the same.\n\nOn one occasion there were five fair sized pythons put into one large cage. The biggest, a very thick snake, was about 25 feet long, the next in size seventeen feet, the others 12 to 15 feet. But during the first two nights the big snake ate the three smaller snakes, and had a try at the other who beat it off though it was slightly wounded. After this the two snakes lived at opposite ends of the cage. The large one was particularly vicious and it was unsafe for the keeper to go into its cage.\n\nThe python requires to be supplied with some arrangement for bathing, as it is very fond of water and suffers much if kept in too hot and dry a place, especially when it is changing its skin a dangerous time for any snake.\n\nAs a rule in spite of their great strength and weight these big snakes are easy to handle as in a struggle they soon get tired. One day one 21 feet long escaped from its cage and took refuge in a wood. As a little rain had fallen it was easily tracked by the broad bar across the road which it had made when passing. It was noosed by a running noose by one of the coolies and of course lashed out and fought furiously for a few minutes, but the other coolies about 20 in number seized it by the tail and body in a row and it was carried along, in spite of its struggles. It showed great ingenuity in getting a kink of its body against a tree and pulling on that, but eventually became quieter and was quite exhausted by the time it was brought to its cage. However it soon recovered, and lived for some time being finally killed by one of those pests to a menagerie, the man who cannot see an animal in a cage however tame without jobbing it with a stick. The man was arrested and fined, but the snake never recovered from the comparatively slight wounds it received. In noosing a snake the captor must wait till it raises its head, which it will generally do when threatened, and he must not miss slipping the noose over its head at the right moment or the snake will understand and dodge.\n\n*Jour. Straits Branch*\nthe noose afterwards every time. When noosed and the snake begins to fight, care must be taken not to get the noose too tight, but play the snake like a fish if it fights much, as it soon gives up. A python can bite severely and its strong recurved teeth make a very bad wound, especially as it will not let go. Two Malays were carrying one through the streets and the one behind who was carrying the head end dropped it, it swung downwards and seized the calf of the leg of the Malay in front, lacerating it severely. I believe the snake's head had to be cut off before the Malay could be released.\n\nMany years ago a python in the cage at the gardens, attacked its keeper. He was an European and went into the cage in a state of intoxication to show off the snake. The snake about 15 feet long, was annoyed and seized him, getting a coil or two round him. Assistance was procured and the snake was got off, but the man was marked all over the body with bruises as if he had been beaten with a thick stick. Had the snake been really intending to crush him, doubtless he would have had some ribs broken at least.\n\nThe python has never bread in captivity in the gardens, but one new caught one laid a large number of eggs on one occasion, now of which however hatched.\n\nThe flesh of the python is eaten by Chinese, and oil from the fat is in much request by Malays as a medicine for rheumatism.\n\n**Reptiles occurring in a wild state in the Garden.**\n\nThe following reptiles have been seen in the gardens in a wild state from time to time.\n\n**Tortoises.**\n\n*Trionyx cartilaginens.* In the lakes.\n\n*Cyclemys platynota.* In the lakes once.\n\n*Testudo ambomensis.* Swamp economic garden.\n\n**Lizards.**\n\n*Aelurbscalabotus felinus.*\n\nRare, in the economic gardens.\n\n*R.

The glumaceous plants too of several large collections such as those of Beccari in Sarawak, Creagh in Sandakan, Motley and Barber in various parts of Borneo, have not at all or only partially been worked out. The best known part of Borneo is Sarawak where Bishop Hose and Miss Hose, Dr. Haviland, and I myself on a short trip have collected. Dr. Haviland whose collections of trees and shrubs were remarkably fine devoted himself but little to herbaceous plants, except on his expedition to Kinabalu.\n\nMost of the Bornean grasses and sedges here also found in the Malay peninsula, and in the adjacent islands of the archipelago.\n\nGramine\u00e6.\n\nPaspalum scrobiculatum, L.

RIDLEY.\n\nThe order of Scitamineae is as well represented in Borneo as in the Malay Peninsula, but it is probable that at present a very large number are yet uncollected or if collected not yet described. The Zingiberaceae and Marantaceae of Beccari's and Korthas' collections were described by Schumann in the Pflanzenreich. Some of these however, I have quite failed to identify with plants collected on the same ground, viz., Kuching and Matang in Sarawak, the scene of Beccari's researches. Dr. Haviland's collection contains but few of the order, but Mr. J. Hewitt, the curator of the museum, has added a good many species to the flora. The genera of Bornean Scitamineae are very much the same as those of the Malay Peninsula. I have not however seen any representatives of the genera Geostachys or conamomum or Hedychium.\n\nThe genera Haplochorema and Burbidgea are peculiar to Borneo.\n\nComparatively few of the Bornean species are actually the same as those of the peninsula, but closely allied forms appear, such as Hornstedtia reticulata, closely allied to H. scyphifera and H. brachycheilus closely allied to H. metriochilus. It is rather curious to note that while yellow Globbas are common in the Malay Peninsula and white ones comparatively rare, the reverse is the case in Borneo, where yellow flowered species are scanty. The number of species Globba is also comparatively small.\n\nThere must be very many more species of this order in Borneo. The Marantaceae especially want working up. I have several which are not in a good enough state to be described. The flowers are so fugacious that they want very\ncareful drying separately from the inflorescence. This paper must be taken therefore as a more preliminary one for the *Scitamineae* of Borneo.\n\n**Globba.**\n\n*Gl. atrosanguinea*, Teysm. and Binn.\n\nThis pretty Globba with its large bright red bracts and yellow flowers is abundant in the Sarawak woods, Kuching (a small form), Bau (Ridley 11803), Bidi, Puak, (Ridley), Barang (Haviland), Rejang, Sibu (Haviland 368).\n\n*Gl. aurantiaca*, Miq.\n\nWas obtained in Borneo by Korthals, no locality being given for it.

Few seem to have been described however. The most abundant are the tall woodland species of the Petermannia section with very insignificant flowers. Young forms often have the leaves prettily spotted, but this soon goes off and the plate becomes tall and dull-colored. This section is a difficult one owing to the variability of the species, possibly some of the abnormal forms one meets with are hybrids. The presence or absence of petals in the male flower is hardly a good character though often used in distinguishing species and groups. I have in some of this section seen flowers with none, or one or two on the same plant. The limestone rocks and mouths of the caves produce a number of pretty species of which *B. speluncae*, with its tufts of round leaves and pretty white flowers is one of the most attractive, while among foliage plants, the beautiful *B. promethea*, growing with only two or three large leaves flat on the rock faces of Bukit Tendong, near Busan, is perhaps the most worthy of cultivation.\n\n\u00a7 Petermannia.

Havilandii, n. sp.\n\nA small herb with a short creeping rhizome and erect branches 2 inches tall leaves ovate broad acute, base very unequal, broad lobe rounded 4 inches long 2\u00bd inch wide, margins toothed each tooth bearing a hair, nerves reticulate, bearing on nerves and nervules rather stiff pale hairs, petiole \u00bc to 1\u00bd inch long hairy when young. The leaves apparently purple marbled when young. Stipules persistent ovate cuspidate keeled \u00bc inch long. Panicle terminal 3 inches little branched. Bracts persistent ovate white, toothed, each tooth bearing a glandular hair. Male flowers \u00bc inch across pedicel about as long. Sepals oblong 2 petals smaller 2. Stamens about 12 oblong nearly sessile.\n\nFemale flowers not seen \"segments 6.\" Capsule orbicular with broad rounded wings, \u00bd inch across the\ntwo wings. Wings semilunar narrowed to the tip broader at base. Ovary 3 celled placentas bifid.\n\nSarawak, Pengkulu Ampat (Haviland 279).\n\n*Begonia promethea*, n. sp.\n\nStem very short prostrate one inch long. Leaves 2, rarely 3 ovate rounded at the tip unequal at the base petiole an inch long thick hairy red, lamina glabrous except a few hairs on the edge and veins on the back, shining light or emerald green with broad brown bars, finally entirely olive green, nerves depressed on the upper surface, lower surface red with elevated nerves, 6 inches long 4 inches wide. Scape rather slender 9 inches long peduncle glabrous red. Bracts oblong \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch long or more in pairs light green. Panicle of few usually two branches, terminal branch bearing one or two female flowers opens first the lower branch bears male flowers and after the female flowers are almost over grows till it is much longer than the female branch, and the male flowers then open.\n\nThe male flowers in three or more terminal sepals 2 semiorbicular \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long, red shining outside, pale pinkish white within. Stamens connate, torus cylindric rather thick, anthers very numerous in a round head, yellow oblanceolate 2 celled with a short stalk.\n\nFemale flowers one or two only, ovary equally 3 winged with rounded wings, \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\) inch long, as broad as long. Sepals 4, 2 ovate obtuse white with red backs 2 narrower all white. Petals linear white narrow (not always present) styles 3 short thick stigmas four lobed unequally all yellow, 2 curved hornshaped, 2 reniform.\n\nBorneo, Sarawak on sandstone rocks at Bukit Tendong near Busau, also Haviland 485,188. This very pretty begonia grows quite flat on the vertical surfaces of the high rocks. I could reach but few plants of it, but two I brought to Singapore grew very readily and flowered in December and January.\nB. Pyrrha, n. sp.\n\nStem creeping slender woolly. Leaves distant orbicular, base cordate 2 inches across, margins hairy with rather pale long hairs upper surface sprinkled with hairs under surface glabrous except the veins covered with wooly appressed hairs, petiole \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long wooly.

B. repens, Miq., from Java and Borneo might possibly be intended for this but the flowers are not described and it is impossible to be certain what was intended.\n\nB. calcarea, n. sp.\n\nRhizome long creeping, over 4 inches covered with appressed hairs roots long and wiry. Leaves erect from the rhizome with stout hairy petioles 6 inches long densely brown hairy, blade peltale almost reniform rounded 6 inches wide, 4 long base rounded margins sinuate with distant teeth, nerves palmate spreading about 8; blade pale green (when dry) above glaucous beneath, fleshy, sprinkled with short stiff hairs above, backs glabrous except the main nerves dark brown hairy. Inflorescence on a very short peduncle rising directly from the rhizome covered with scale like leaves. Male flowers not seen. Capsule obovoid in outline with 3\nequal wings, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long narrow at the base widened towards the apex, perianth apparently 6 lobed.\n\nSarawak, top of Mount Braang old jungle limestone (Haviland).\n\nI have only seen one specimen of this curious begonia with a single capsule and no flowers. It is hardly sufficient to describe.\n\n\\( B. \\) (Platycentrum), adenostegia, Stapf., Trans. Linn Soc. IV. 164. An erect epiphytic plant under a foot tall glabrous with leaves entire acute shortly petioled a short little branched panicle with small persistent oblong bracts male flowers \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch across, sepals 2 petals 2 white. Female flowers 5 lobed capsule with one large oblong wing and two smaller ones.\n\nKinabalu, at Kinitaki 4500 feet, (Haviland 1270).\nShort Notes.\n\nCurious Nesting Place of Simotes Octolineatus.\n\nIn September last an old *Spathodea nilotica* tree which had been sickly for some time was cut down in the Botanic Gardens. In breaking it up one bough was found to be full of old borings of some longicorn beetle, and ensconced in one of these tunnels was found a living female snake (*Simotes octolineatus*) about a foot long which had already laid about a dozen oblong eggs an inch long in the tunnel. The bough was more than twenty feet from the ground, and the tree was isolated and with a bare trunk so that the snake must have climbed up the slightly roughened bark of the trunk. There were several openings into the bough whence the beetles had escaped and through one of these the little snake must have entered the burrow.\n\nH. N. Ridley.\n\nFertilization of Barringtonia.\n\nIn Journal No. 41.*p. 124 a description of the fertilization of *Barringtonia racemosa* was given. The moth described as conveying the pollen to the stigma and so fertilizing the flower has been identified by Sir George Hampson as *Zethes rufipennis* Hampson.\n\nH. N. Ridley.\n\nJour.
