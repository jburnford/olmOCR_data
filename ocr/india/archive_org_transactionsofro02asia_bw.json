Essay on the Philosophy of the Hindus. Part V. By Henry Thomas Colebrooke, Esq., Dir. R.A.S.\n\nRead April 7th, 1827.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nA preceding essay on Indian philosophy* contained a succinct account of the Carma-mimansa. The present one will be devoted to the Brahma-mimansa; which, as the complement of the former, is termed uttara, later, contrasted with purva, prior, being the investigation of proof deducible from the vedas in regard to theology, as the other is in regard to works and their merit. The two together, then, comprise the complete system of interpretation of the precepts and doctrine of the vedas, both practical and theological. They are parts of one whole. The later mimansa is supplementary to the prior, and is expressly affirmed to be so: but, differing on many important points, though agreeing on others, they are essentially distinct in a religious as in a philosophical view.\n\nThe ordinary designation of the uttara mimansa is vedanta, a term likewise of more comprehensive import. It literally signifies \"conclusion of the veda,\" and bears reference to the upanishads, which are, for the most part, terminating sections of the vedas to which they belong. It implies, however, the doctrine derived from them, and extends to books of sacred\n\n* Vol. i. p. 439.\nauthority, in which that doctrine is thence deduced; and in this large ac-\nceptation, it is \"the end and scope of the v\u00e9das.\"\n\nThe followers of the v\u00e9d\u00e1nta have separated in several sects, as 'ancient'\nand 'modern' v\u00e9d\u00e1ntins, and bearing other designations. The points on\nwhich they disagree, and the difference of their opinions, will not be a\nsubject of the present essay, but may be noticed in a future one.\n\nAmong numerous upanishads, those which are principally relied upon for\nthe v\u00e9d\u00e1nta, and which accordingly are most frequently cited, are the\nCh'h\u00e1nd\u00f3gya, Caushit\u00e1c\u00ed, Vr\u00edhad-aran'yaca, Aitar\u00e9yaca, Taittir\u00edyaca, C\u00e1'thaca,\nCat'havalli, Mu\u0144d'aca, Pras'na, Sw\u00e9t\u00e1s'watara; to which may be added the\nP's\u00e1-v\u00e1sya, C\u00e9na, and one or two more.\n\nCertain religious exercises, consisting chiefly in profound meditation,\nwith particular sitting postures rigorously continued, are inculcated as pre-\nparing the student for the attainment of divine knowledge, and promoting\nhis acquisition of it. Directions concerning such devout exercises are to\nbe found in several of the upanishads, especially in the S'w\u00e9t\u00e1s'watara; and\nlikewise in other portions of the v\u00e9das, as a part of the general ritual. These\nare accordingly cited by the commentators of the v\u00e9d\u00e1nta; and must be\nconsidered to be comprehended under that general term;* and others from\ndifferent s\u00e1chas of the v\u00e9das, as further exemplified in a note below.\u2020\n\nBesides the portion of the v\u00e9das understood to be intended by the desig-\nnation of v\u00e9d\u00e1nta, the grand authority for its doctrine is the collection of\ns\u00fatras, or aphorisms, entitled Brahm\u00e9-s\u00fatra or S'\u00e1r\u00edraca m\u00edm\u00e1ns\u00e1, and some-\ntimes S'\u00e1r\u00edra-s\u00fatra or V\u00e9d\u00e1nta-s\u00fatra. S'\u00e1r\u00edra, it should be observed, signifies\nembodied or incarnate (soul).\n\nOther authorities are the ancient scholia of that text, which is the stan-\ndard work of the science; and didactic poems comprehended under the\ndesignation of smr\u00ecti, a name implying a certain degree of veneration due\nto the authors. Such are the Bhagavad git\u00e1 and Y\u00f3ga-vasisht'ha, reputed\nto be inspired writings.\n\n---\n\n* For instance, the Agni rahasya br\u00e1hmana of the C\u00e1nvas and of the V\u00e1jins (or V\u00e1jas'an\u00e9yins);\nthe Rahasya br\u00e1hmana of the T\u00e1ndins and of the Paingins.\n\n\u2020 The Udg\u00ed'tha-br\u00e1hmana of the V\u00e1jas'an\u00e9yf\u00edns, the Panch\u00e1g\u00f1i-vidy\u00e1-pracaran'a of the same,\nthe Ch'ila grant'ha of the R\u00e1n'\u00fayaniyas, the Pr\u00e1na samv\u00e1da or Pr\u00e1na vidy\u00e1, Dahara vidy\u00e1,\nH\u00e1rda vidy\u00e1, Param\u00e1tma-vidy\u00e1, Satya vidy\u00e1, Vais'w\u00e1nara-vidy\u00e1, S\u00e1n'dilya-vidy\u00e1, V\u00e1mad\u00e9vy\u00e1\nvidy\u00e1, Up\u00e1c\u00f3s'ala-vidy\u00e1, Paryanca-vidy\u00e1, Madh\u00fa-vidy\u00e1, Sh\u00f3'd\u00e1s'acala-vidy\u00e1, Samvarga-vidy\u00e1, &c.\nWriters on the V\u00e9d\u00e1nta.\n\nThe S'\u00e1riraca m\u00edm\u00e1ns\u00e1 or Brahme-s\u00fatra, above-mentioned, is a collection of succinct aphorisms attributed to B\u00e1dar\u00e1ya\u00f1a, who is the same with Vy\u00e1sa or V\u00e9da-vy\u00e1sa; also called Dwaip\u00e1dyana or Crishn'a-dwaip\u00e1dyana. According to mythology, he had in a former state, being then a br\u00e1hmana bearing the name of Ap\u00e1ntara-tamas,* acquired a perfect knowledge of revelation and of the divinity, and was consequently qualified for eternal beatitude. Nevertheless, by special command of the deity, he resumed a corporeal frame and the human shape, at the period intervening between the third and fourth ages of the present world, and was compiler of the v\u00e9das, as his title of Vy\u00e1sa implies.\n\nIn the Pur\u00e1n'as, and by Par\u00e1s'ara, he is said to be an incarnation (avat\u00e1ra) of Vish\u0144u. This, however, is not altogether at variance with the foregoing legend; since Ap\u00e1ntara-tamas, having attained perfection, was identified with the deity; and his resumption of the human form was a descent of the god, in mythological notions.\n\nApart from mythology, it is not to be deemed unlikely, that the person (whoever he really was) who compiled and arranged the v\u00e9das, was led to compose a treatise on their scope and essential doctrine. But Vy\u00e1sa is also reputed author of the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata, and most of the principal pur\u00e1n'as; and that is for the contrary reason improbable, since the doctrine of the pur\u00e1n'as, and even of the Bhagavad git\u00e1 and the rest of the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata, are not quite consonant to that of the v\u00e9das, as expounded in the Brahme s\u00fatras. The same person would not have deduced from the same premises such different conclusions.\n\nThe name of B\u00e1dar\u00e1ya\u00f1a frequently recurs in the s\u00fatras ascribed to him, as does that of Jaimini, the reputed author of the P\u00farva m\u00edm\u00e1ns\u00e1, in his. I have already remarked, in the preceding essay,+ on the mention of an author by his name, and in the third person, in his own work. It is nothing unusual in literature or science of other nations: but a Hindu commentator will account for it, by presuming the actual composition to be that of a disciple recording the words of his teacher.\n\nBesides B\u00e1dar\u00e1ya\u00f1a himself, and his great predecessor Jaimini, several other distinguished names likewise occur, though less frequently: some which are also noticed in the P\u00farva-m\u00edm\u00e1ns\u00e1, as Atr\u00e9yi and B\u00e1dari; and\n\n* Sanc. &c. on Br. S\u00fatr. 3. 3. 32. \u2020 Vol. i. p. 440.\nsome which are not there found, as Asmarat'hy\u0101, Aud'ul\u014dmi, C\u0101rsh\u1e47\u0101jini, and C\u0101sacr\u012btsna; and the Y\u014dga of Patanjali, which consequently is an anterior work; as indeed it must be, if its scholiast, as generally acknowledged, be the same Vx\u0101sa who is the author of the aphorisms of the Uttara m\u012bm\u0101ns\u0101.\n\nThe S'\u0101riraca is also posterior to the atheistical S\u0101ne'hy\u0101 of Capila, to whom, or at least to his doctrine, there are many marked allusions in the text.\n\nThe atomic system of Ca\u00f1\u0101de (or, as the scholiast of the S'\u0101riraca, in more than one place, contumeliously designates him, Ca\u00f1a-bhuj or Ca\u00f1a-bhacsha) is frequently adverted to for the purpose of confutation; as are the most noted heretical systems, viz. the several sects of Jainas, the Buddhas, the P\u0101\u015bupatas with other classes of M\u016bh\u0113\u015bwaras, the P\u0101nchar\u0101tr\u0101s or Bh\u0101gavatas, and divers other schismatics.\n\nFrom this, which is also supported by other reasons, there seems to be good ground for considering the S'\u0101riraca to be the latest of the six grand systems of doctrine (dar\u015bana) in Indian philosophy: later, likewise, than the heresies which sprung up among the Hindus of the military and mercantile tribes (cshatriya and vai\u015bya) and which, disclaiming the V\u0113das, set up a Jina or a Buddha for an object of worship; and later even than some, which, acknowledging the V\u0113das, have deviated into heterodoxy in their interpretation of the text.\n\nIn a separate essay,* I have endeavoured to give some account of the heretical and heterodox sects which the S'\u0101riraca confutes; and of which the tenets are explained, for the elucidation of that confutation, in its numerous commentaries. I allude particularly to the Jainas, Buddhas, Ch\u0101rv\u0101cas, P\u0101\u015bupatas, and P\u0101nchar\u0101tras.\n\nThe s\u016btras of B\u0101dar\u0101ya\u1e47a are arranged in four books or lectures (\u0101dhy\u0101ya), each subdivided into four chapters or quarters (p\u0101da). Like the aphorisms of the prior m\u012bm\u0101ns\u0101, they are distributed very unequally into sections, arguments, cases, or topics, (adhicarana.) The entire number of s\u016btras is 555; of adhicarana\u015b, 191. But in this there is a little uncertainty, for it appears from S'ancara, that earlier commentaries subdivided some adhicaranas, where he writes the aphorisms in one section.\n\nAn adhicarana in the later, as in the prior m\u012bm\u0101ns\u0101, consists of five members or parts: 1st. the subject and matter to be explained; 2d. the\n\n---\n\n* Vol. i. p. 549.\ndoubt or question concerning it; 3d. the plausible solution or *prim\u0101 fucie* argument; 4th. the answer, or demonstrated conclusion and true solution; 5th. the pertinence or relevancy and connexion.\n\nBut in B\u0101dar\u0101ya\u1e47a's aphorisms, as in those of Jaimini, no *adhicaran'a* is fully set forth. Very frequently the solution only is given by a single *s\u016btra*, which obscurely hints the question, and makes no allusion to any different plausible solution, nor to arguments in favour of it. More rarely the opposed solution is examined at some length, and arguments in support of it are discussed through a string of brief sentences.\n\nBeing a sequel of the prior m\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, the latter adopts the same distinctions of six sources of knowledge or modes of proof* which are taught by Jaimini, supplied where he is deficient by the old scholiast. There is, indeed, no direct mention of them in the Brahm\u0119-s\u016btras, beyond a frequent reference to oral proof, meaning revelation, which is sixth among those modes. But the commentators make ample use of a logic which employs the same terms with that of the p\u016brva m\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sa, being founded on it, though not without amendments on some points. Among the rest, the V\u00e9d\u0101ntins have taken the syllogism (*ny\u0101ya*) of the dialectic philosophy, with the obvious improvement of reducing its five members to three.\u2020 \"It consists,\" as expressly declared, \"of three, not of five parts; for as the requisites of the inference are exhibited by three members, two more are superfluous. They are either the proposition, the reason, and the example; or the instance, the application, and the conclusion.\"\n\nIn this state it is a perfectly regular syllogism, as I had occasion to remark in a former essay;\u2021 and it naturally becomes a question, whether the emendation was borrowed from the Greeks, or being sufficiently obvious, may be deemed purely Indian, fallen upon without hint or assistance from another quarter. The improvement does not appear to be of ancient date, a circumstance which favours the supposition of its having been borrowed. The earliest works in which I have found it mentioned are of no antiquity.\u00a7\n\nThe logic of the two m\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101s merits a more full examination than the limits of the present essay allow, and it has been reserved for a separate consideration at a future opportunity, because it has been refined and\n\n---\n\n* V\u00e9d\u0101nta Paribh\u0101\u1e63\u0101.\n\u2020 V.

Hinting the question or its solution, rather than proposing the one or briefly delivering the other, they but allude to the subject. Like the aphorisms of other Indian sciences, they must from the first have been accompanied by the author's exposition of the meaning, whether orally taught by him or communicated in writing.\n\nAmong ancient scholiasts of the Brahme-s\u016btras the name of Baudh\u0101yana occurs: an appellation to which reverence, as to that of a saint or rishi, attaches. He is likewise the reputed author of a treatise on law. An early gloss, under the designation of vritti, is quoted without its author's name, and is understood to be adverted to in the remarks of later writers, in several instances, where no particular reference is however expressed. It is apparently Baudh\u0101yana's. An ancient writer on both m\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101s (prior and later) is cited, under the name of Upavarsa, with the epithet of venerable (bhagavat),* implying that he was a holy personage. He is noticed in the supplement to the Amera-c\u014dsha\u2020 as a saint (muni), with the titles or additions of Hala-bhr\u012bti, Crita-c\u014dt'i, and Ayachita. It does not appear that any of his works are now forthcoming.\n\nThe most distinguished scholiast of these s\u016btras, in modern estimation, is the celebrated S'ancara \u0101ch\u0101rya, the founder of a sect among Hindus which is yet one of the most prevalent. I have had a former occasion of discussing the antiquity of this eminent person; and the subject has been since examined by R\u0101ma M\u014dhen R\u0101ya and by Mr. Wilson.\u00a7 I continue of opinion, that the period when he flourished may be taken to have been the close of the eighth or beginning of the ninth century of the Christian era; and I am confirmed in it by the concurring opinions of those very learned persons.\n\nHow much earlier the older scholia were, or the text itself, there is no evidence to determine. If the reputed author be the true one, it would be necessary to go back nearly two thousand years, to the era of the arrangement of the v\u0113das by Vy\u0101sa.\n\nS'ancara's gloss or perpetual commentary of the s\u016btras bears the title of\n\n* Sanc. 3.3.53. \u2020 Tric\u0101nd. s\u0113sh. \u00a7 Sans. Dict., pref. xvi.\nS'\u00e1riraca-mim\u00e1ns\u00e1-bh\u00e1shya. It has been annotated and interpreted by a herd of commentators; and among others, and most noted, by V\u00c1CHESPATI M\u00cdS'RA, in the Bh\u00e1mati or S'\u00e1riraca-bh\u00e1shya-vibh\u00e1ga.\n\nThis is the same V\u00c1CHESPATI, whose commentaries on the S\u00e1nchya-c\u00e1ric\u00e1 of Is'vara chandra, and on the text and gloss of Patanjali's Y\u00f3ga and G\u00f3tama's Ny\u00e1ya, were noticed in former essays.* He is the author of other treatises on dialectics (Ny\u00e1ya), and of one entitled (Tatwa-vindu) on the p\u00farva mim\u00e1ns\u00e1, as it is expounded by Bhat't'a. All his works, in every department, are held in high and deserved estimation.\n\nV\u00c1CHESPATI's exposition of S'ancara's gloss, again, has been amply annotated and explained in the V\u00e9d\u00e1nta-calpataru of Anal\u00e1nanda, surnamed Vy\u00e1s\u00e1\u015brama; whose notes, in their turn, become the text for other scholia: especially a voluminous collection under the title of Parimala, or V\u00e9d\u00e1nta-calpataru-parimala, by Ap\u00fd\u00e1ya-d\u00edcshtita (author of several other works); and an abridged one, under that of V\u00e9d\u00e1nta-calpataru-manjar\u00ed, by Vidy\u00e1n\u00e1t'habh\u00e1t't'a.\n\nOther commentaries on S'ancara's gloss are numerous and esteemed, though not burdened with so long a chain of scholia upon scholia: for instance, the Brahma-vidy\u00e1bharan\u00eda by Adwait\u00e1nanda,\u2020 and the Bh\u00e1shya-ratna-prabh\u00e1 by G\u00f3vind\u00e1nanda: both works of acknowledged merit.\n\nThese multiplied expositions of the text and of the gloss furnish an inexhaustible fund of controversial disquisition, suited to the disputatious schoolmen of India. On many occasions, however, they are usefully consulted, in succession, for annotations supplying a right interpretation of obscure passages in S'ancara's scholia or in Vyasa's text.\n\nAnother perpetual commentary on the s\u00fatras of the S'\u00e1riraca by a distinguished author, is the work of the celebrated R\u00e1m\u00e1nuja, the founder of\n\n---\n\n* Vol. i. pp. 24, 25, 93.\n\u2020 It is by Mr. Ward named v\u00e9d\u00e1nta s\u00fatra vy\u00e1c'hy\u00e1 by Brahme-vidy\u00e1bh\u00e1rana', mistaking the title of the work for the appellation of the author. Yet it is expressly affirmed in the rubric and colophon to be the work of Adwait\u00e1nanda, who abridged it from an ampler commentary by R\u00e1m\u00e1nuja T\u00edrt'ha. The mistake is the more remarkable, as the same Adwait\u00e1nanda was preceptor of Sad\u00e1nanda, whose work, the v\u00e9d\u00e1nta-sdra, Mr. Ward attempted to translate; and the only part of Sad\u00e1nanda's preface, which is preserved in the version, is that preceptor's name. Mr. Ward's catalogue of treatises extant belonging to this school of philosophy exhibits other like errors. He puts M\u00e1dhava for Madhus\u00fadana, the name of an author; converts a commentary (the muct\u00e1vali) into an abridgment; and turns the text (m\u00fala) of the v\u00e9d\u00e1nta-sdra into its essence. Ward's Hindus, vol. iv. pp. 172, 173.\na sect which has sprung as a schism out of the V\u00e9d\u00e1ntin. The points of doctrine, on which these great authorities differ, will be inquired into in another place. It may be readily supposed that they are not unfrequently at variance in the interpretation of the text, and I shall, therefore, make little use of the scholia of R\u00e1m\u00e1nuja for the present essay. For the same reason, I make no reference to the commentaries of Ballabha A'ch\u00e1rya, Bhat't'a Bh\u00e1scara, Ananta T\u00edrt'ha surnamed Madhu, and N\u00edlacant'ha, whose interpretations differ essentially on some points from S'ancara's.\n\nCommentaries on the S'\u00e1riraca s\u00fatras by authors of less note are extremely numerous. I shall content myself with naming such only as are immediately under view, viz. the V\u00e9d\u00e1nta-s\u00fatra-muct\u00e1vali by Brahm\u00e1nanda-Saraswat\u00ed;* the Brahma-s\u00fatra-bh\u00e1shya or Mim\u00e1s\u00e1-bh\u00e1shya, by Bh\u00e1scar\u00e1ch\u00e1rya; the V\u00e9d\u00e1nta-sitra-vy\u00e1c'hya-chandric\u00e1, by Bhavad\u00e9va Mis'ra; the Vy\u00e1sa-s\u00fatra-vritti, by Rangan\u00e1t'ha; the Sub\u00f3dhin\u00ed or S'\u00e1vira-s\u00fatra s\u00e1r\u00e1rt'ha chandric\u00e1, by Gang\u00e1dhara; and the Brahmanr\u00edta-vershin'i, by R\u00e1m\u00e1nanda.\n\nThis list might with ease be greatly enlarged. Two of the commentaries, which have been consulted in progress of preparing the present essay, are without the author's name, either in preface or colophon, in the only copies which I have seen; and occasions have occurred for noticing authors of commentaries on other branches of philosophy, as well as on the Brahma m\u00edm\u00e1s\u00e1 (for instance, Vijny\u00e1na Bhicshu, author of the S\u00e1nchhya-s\u00e1ra and Y\u00f3ga-v\u00e1rtica).\u2020\n\nTo these many and various commentaries in prose, on the text and on the scholia, must be added more than one in verse. For instance, the Sancsh\u00e9pa-s'\u00e1riraca, which is a metrical paraphrase of text and gloss, by Sarvajny\u00e1tma-g\u00edra a sanny\u00e1si: it is expounded by a commentary entitled Anway\u00e1rt'ha-prac\u00e1s'ic\u00e1, by R\u00e1ma T\u00edrt'ha, disciple of Crish\u00f1a T\u00edrt'ha, and author of several other works; in particular, a commentary on the Upad\u00e9\u015ba-sahasr\u00ed, and one on the V\u00e9d\u00e1nta-s\u00e1ra.\n\nBesides his great work, the interpretation of the s\u00fatras, S'ancara wrote commentaries on all the principal or important Upanishads. His preceptor, G\u00f3vinda, and the preceptor's teacher, Gaud'ap\u00e1da, had already written commentaries on many of them.\n\nS'ancara is author, likewise, of several distinct treatises; the most noted\n\n* Mr. Ward calls this an abridgment of the V\u00e9d\u00e1nta-s\u00fatras. It is no abridgment, but a commentary in ordinary form.\n\u2020 Vol. i. p. 22.\nof which is the *Upad\u0113\u015ba-sahasr\u012b*, a metrical summary of the doctrine deduced by him from the *Upanishads* and *Brahma-s\u016btras*, in his commentaries on those original works. The text of the *Upad\u0113\u015ba-sahasr\u012b* has been expounded by more than one commentator; and among others by R\u0101ma T\u012brtha, already noticed for his comment on the *Sancsh\u0113pa-\u015b\u0101riraca*. His gloss of the *Upad\u0113\u015ba-sahasr\u012b* is entitled *Pada-y\u014djanic\u0101*.\n\nElementary treatises on the *Ved\u0101nta* are very abundant. It may suffice to notice a few which are popular and in general use, and which have been consulted in the preparation of the present essay.\n\nThe *Ved\u0101nta-paribh\u0101sha* of Dharmar\u0101ja D\u012bcshita explains, as its title indicates, the technical terms of the *Ved\u0101nta*; and, in course of doing so, opens most of the principal points of its doctrine. A commentary on this work by the author's son, R\u0101ma-Crishna D\u012bcshita, bears the title of *Ved\u0101nta-\u015biv\u0101h\u0101mani*. Taken together, they form an useful introduction to the study of this branch of Indian philosophy.\n\nThe *Ved\u0101nta-s\u0101ra* is a popular compendium of the entire doctrine of the *Ved\u0101nta.* It is the work of Sad\u0101nanda, disciple of Adway\u0101nanda or Adwait\u0101nanda before-mentioned, and has become the text for several\n\n---\n\n* Mr. Ward has given, in the fourth volume of his View of the History, Literature, and Mythology of the Hindus (third edition), a translation of the *Ved\u0101nta-s\u0101ra*. I wish to speak as gently as I can of Mr. Ward's performance; but having collated this, I am bound to say it is no version of the original text, and seems to have been made from an oral exposition through the medium of a different language, probably the Bengalese. This will be evident to the oriental scholar on the slightest comparison: for example, the introduction, which does not correspond with the original in so much as a single word, the name of the author's preceptor alone excepted; nor is there a word of the translated introduction countenanced by any of the commentaries. At the commencement of the treatise, too, where the requisite qualifications of a student are enumerated, Mr. Ward makes his author say, that a person possessing those qualifications is heir to the *veda* (p. 176). There is no term in the text, nor in the commentaries, which could suggest the notion of heir; unless Mr. Ward has so translated *adhic\u0101ri* (a competent or qualified person), which in Bengalese signifies proprietor, or, with the epithet *uttara* (*uttar\u0101dhic\u0101ri*), heir or successor. It would be needless to pursue the comparison further. The meaning of the original is certainly not to be gathered from such translations of this and (as Mr. Ward terms them) of other principal works of the Hindus, which he has presented to the public.\n\nI was not aware, when preparing the former essays on the Philosophy of the Hindus which have been inserted in the first volume of Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society, that Mr. Ward had treated the same topics: but I think it now unnecessary to revert to the subject, for the purpose of offering any remarks on his explanation of other branches of Indian philosophy.\n\nVol. II.\ncommentaries; and, among the rest, the *Vidwan-man\u00f3-ranjini*, by R\u00e1ma-t\u00edrt'ha, who has been already twice noticed for other works; and the *Subb\u00f3dhini*, by Nr\u00edsinha saraswat\u00ed, disciple of Cr\u00edshn\u00e1nanda.\n\nA few other treatises may be here briefly noticed.\n\nThe *S\u00e1stra-siddh\u00e1nta-l\u00e9sa-sangraha*, by Aryaya or (Apyai) d\u00edcshita, son of Rangan\u00e1t'ha or Rangar\u00e1ja d\u00edcshita, and author of the *Parimala* on the *Siddh\u00e1nta Calpataru*, before-mentioned, as well as of other works, has the benefit of a commentary, entitled *Cr\u00edshn\u00e1lanc\u00e1ra*, by Achyuta Cr\u00edshn\u00e1nanda t\u00edrt'ha, disciple of Swayam-prac\u00e1s'\u00e1nanda saraswat\u00ed. The *V\u00e9d\u00e1nta-siddh\u00e1nta-vindu*, by Madhus\u00fadana, disciple of Vis'w\u00e9s'war\u00e1nanda saraswat\u00ed, and author of the *V\u00e9d\u00e1nta-calpa-lat\u00edca* and of other works, is in like manner commented on by Brahm\u00e1nanda, disciple of N\u00e1r\u00e1ya\u00f1a t\u00edrt'ha.\n\n**Analysis.**\n\nThe *uttara mim\u00e1ns\u00e1* opens precisely as the *p\u00farva*, announcing the purport in the same terms, except a single, but most important word, *brahm\u00e9* instead of *dharma*. 'Next, therefore, the inquiry is concerning God.'\u2020 It proceeds thus: '[He is that] whence are the birth and [continuance, and dissolution] of this [world]: [He is] the source of [revelation or] holy ordinance.'\u2021 That is, as the commentators infer from these aphorisms so expounded, 'He is the omnipotent creator of the world and the omniscient author of revelation.' It goes on to say, 'This appears from the import and right construction of holy writ.'\n\nThe author of the *s\u00fatras* next\u00a7 enters upon a confutation of the *S\u00e1nc'hyas*, who insist that *nature*, termed *prad'h\u00e1na*, which is the material cause of the universe, as they affirm, is the same with the omniscient and omnipotent cause of the world recognised by the *v\u00e9das*. It is not so; for 'wish' (consequently volition) is attributed to that cause, which moreover is termed (*\u00e1tman*) soul: 'He wished to be many and prolific, and became manifold.' And again, 'He desired to be many, &c....'\u00b6 Therefore he is a sentient rational being; not insensible, as the *pracriti* (nature) or *pradh\u00e1na* (matter) of Capila is affirmed to be.\n\n---\n\n* In this analysis of the *s\u00fatras*, a portion of the scholia or explanations of commentators is blended with the text, for a brief abstract and intelligible summary of the doctrine.\n\n\u2020 Br.

He is the breath (pr\u00e1\u0144a) and intelligent self, immortal, undecaying, and happy, with which Indra, in a dialogue with Pratardana, identifies himself.'\u00b6\n\nThe term pr\u00e1\u0144a, which is the subject of two of the sections just quoted (\u00a7 9 and 11), properly and primarily signifies respiration, as well as certain other vital actions (inspiration, energy, expiration, digestion, or circulation of nourishment); and secondarily, the senses and organs.** But, in the passages here referred to, it is employed for a different signification, intending the supreme Brahme; as also in divers other texts of the v\u00e9das: and, among the rest, in one where the senses are said to be absorbed into it during profound sleep;\u2020\u2020 for 'while a man sleeps without dreaming, his soul is with Brahme.'\n\nFurther cases of the like nature, but in which the indications of the true meaning appear less evident, are discussed at length in the second and third chapters of the first book. Those in which the distinctive attributes of the supreme being are more positively indicated by the passage whereon a question arises, had been considered in the foregoing chapter: they are not so clearly denoted in the passages now examined.

Throughout these cases, completed where requisite by the scholiast, divers interpretations of a particular term or phrase are first proposed, as obvious and plausible, and reasons favourable to the proposed explanation set forth; but are set aside by stronger arguments, for a different and opposite construction. The reasoning is here omitted, as it would need much elucidation; and the purpose of this analysis is to exhibit the topics treated, and but summarily the manner of handling them.\n\nIt is not the embodied (s\u00e1rdra) and individual soul, but the supreme Brahme himself,* on whom devout meditation is to be fixed, as enjoined in a passage which declares: 'this universe is indeed Brahme;'* for it springs from him, merges in him, breathes in him: therefore, serene, worship him. Verily, a devout man, as are his thoughts or deeds in this world, such does he become departing hence [in another birth]. Frame then the devout meditation, \"a living body endued with mind......\"\u2020\n\nIt is neither fire nor the individual soul, but the supreme being, who is the 'devourer' (attri) described in the dialogue between Yama and Nachicetas:\u2021 'who, then, knows where abides that being, whose food is the priest and the soldier (and all which is fixt or moveable), and death is his sauce?'\n\nIn the following passage, the supreme spirit, and not the intellectual faculty, is associated with the individual living soul, as \"two occupying the cavity or ventricle of the heart\" (guh\u00e1m pravishtau \u00e1tmanau). 'Theologists, as well as worshippers maintaining sacred fires, term light and shade the contrasted two, who abide in the most excellent abode, worthy of the supreme, occupying the cavity (of the heart), dwelling together in the worldly body, and tasting the certain fruit of good (or of evil) works.'\u00a7\n\nIn the following extract from a dialogue,\u00b6 in which Satyac\u00e1ma instructs Upac\u00f3sala, the supreme being is meant; not the reflected image in the eye, nor the informing deity of that organ, nor the regent of the sun, nor\n\n---\n\n* Brahman is, in this acceptation, a neuter noun (nom. Brahme or Brahma); and the same term in the masculine (nom. Brahm\u00e1), is one of the three gods who constitute one person. But it is more conformable with our idiom to employ the masculine exclusively, and many Sanscrit terms of the same import are masculine; as Param\u00e1tman-(tm\u00e1), Param\u00e9svara, &c.\n\n\u2020 Ch'h\u00e1nd\u00f3gya, 3.

The inferior comprises the four v\u00e9das, with their appendages, grammar, &c.' (all of which he enumerates): 'but the superior (or best and most beneficial) is that by which the unalterable (being) is comprehended, who is invisible (imperceptible by organs of sense), ungrasped (notprehensible by organs of action), come of no race, belonging to no tribe, devoid of eye, ear (or other sensitive organ), destitute of hand, foot (or other instrument of action), everlasting lord, present every where, yet most minute. Him, invariable, the wise contemplate as the source (or cause) of beings. As the spider puts forth and draws in his thread, as plants spring from the earth (and return to it), as hair of the head and body grows from the living man, so does the universe come of the unalterable......' Here it is the supreme being, not nature or a material cause, nor an embodied individual soul, who is the invisible (adr\u0113\u015bya) ungrasped source of (all) beings (bh\u016bta-y\u014dmi).\n\nIn a dialogue between several interlocutors, Pr\u0101ch\u012bnas\u0101la, Udd\u0101laca, and Aswapati, king of the Caiceyis, (of which a version at length was inserted in an essay on the v\u00e9das, As.

The answer is, that the junction of both general terms limits the sense, and restricts the purport of the passage to the single object to which both terms are applicable: it relates, then, to the supreme being.*\n\nUnder this section the author twice cites Jaimini:\u2020 once for obviating any difficulty or apparent contradiction in this place, by taking the term in its literal and etymological sense (universal guide of men), instead of the particular acceptation of fire; and again, as justifying, by a parallel passage in another v\u00e9d\u00e1,\u2021 an epithet intimating the minute size of the being in question (pr\u00e1d\u00e9\u015b'a-m\u00e1tra), a span long.\u00a7 On this last point other ancient authors are likewise cited: one, As'marat'hy\u00e1, who explains it as the result of shrinking or condensation; the other, B\u00e1dari, as a fruit of imagination or mental conception.|| Reference is also made to another s\u00e1c'h\u00e1 of the v\u00e9d\u00e1,\u00b6 where the infinite, supreme soul, is said to occupy the spot between the eye-brows and nose.\n\n'That on which heaven and earth and the intermediate transpicuous region are fixt, mind, with the vital airs (or sensitive organs), know to be the one soul (\u00e1tman): reject other doctrines. This alone is the bridge of immortality,'** In this passage of an upanishad of the Atharvana, Brahme is intended, and not any other supposed site (\u00e1yatana) of heaven, earth, &c.\n\nIn a dialogue between N\u00e1reda and Sanatcum\u00e1ra, the (bh\u00faman) \"great\" one, proposed as an object of inquiry for him who desires unlimited happiness, since there is no bliss in that which is finite and small, is briefly defined. 'He is great, in whom nought else is seen, heard, or known: but that wherein ought else is seen, heard, or known, is small.'\u2020\u2020 Here the supreme being is meant; not breath (pr\u00e1na'), which had been previously mentioned as greatest, in a climax of enumerated objects.\n\n* Ch'h\u00e1nd\u00f3gya, 5.

It is the supreme being who is here meant.\n\n'The mystic syllable om, composed of three elements of articulation, is a subject of devout meditation; and the efficacy of that meditation depends on the limited or extended sense in which it is contemplated. The question concerning this mode of worship is discussed in a dialogue between Pippal\u0101da and Satyac\u0101ma.\u2020\n\nIf the devotion be restricted to the sense indicated by one element, the effect passes not beyond this world; if to that indicated by two of the elements, it extends to the lunar orb, whence however the soul returns to a new birth; if it be more comprehensive, embracing the import of the three elements of the word, the ascent is to the solar orb, whence, stripped of sin, and liberated as a snake which has cast its slough, the soul proceeds to the abode of Brahm\u0113, and to the contemplation of (purusha) him who resides in a corporeal frame: that is, soul reposing in body (puri-s'aya).\n\nThat mystic name, then, is applied either to the supreme Brahm\u0113, uniform, with no quality or distinction of parts; or to Brahm\u0113, not supreme, but an effect (c\u0101rya) diversified, qualified; who is the same with the Vir\u0101j and Hiran'ya-garbha of mythology, born in the mundane egg.\n\nIt appears from the latter part of the text, that it is the supreme Brahm\u0113 to whom meditation is to be directed, and on whom the thoughts are to be fixed, for that great result of liberation from sin and worldly trammels.\n\nIn a passage descriptive of the lesser ventricle of the heart, it is said: 'within this body (Brahme-pura) Brahm\u0113's abode, is a (dahara) little lotus, a dwelling within which is a (dahara) small vacuity occupied by ether (\u0101c\u0101\u015ba).

All shines after his effulgence (reflecting his light), by whose splendour this whole (world) is illumined.'* In this passage it is no particular luminary or mine of light, but the (prajnya) intelligent soul (supreme Brahme) which shines with no borrowed light.\n\nIn the dialogue between Yama and Nachicetas, before cited, are the following passages.\u2020 'A person (purusha) no bigger than the thumb abides in the midst of self;' and again, 'the person no bigger than the thumb is clear as a smokeless flame, lord of the past (present) and future; he is today and will be to-morrow: such is he (concerning whom you inquire).' This is evidently said of the supreme ruler, not of the individual living soul.\n\nAnother passage of the same upanishad \u2021 declares: 'this whole universe, issuing from breath (pr\u0101\u1e47a), moves as it impels: great, terrible, as a clap of thunder. They, who know it, become immortal.' Brahme, not the thunderbolt nor wind, is here meant.\n\n'The living soul (samprasada) rising from this corporeal frame, attains the supreme light, and comes forth with his identical form.'\u00a7 It is neither the light of the sun, nor the visual organ, but Brahme, that is here meant.\n\n'Ether (\u0101c\u0101\u015b'a) is the bearer (cause of bearing) of name and form. That, in the midst of which they both are, is Brahme: it is immortality; it is soul.'|| \u0100c\u0101\u015b'a here intends the supreme being, not the element so named.\n\nIn a dialogue between Yajnyawalca and Janaca,\u00b6 in answer to an inquiry 'which is the soul?' the intelligent internal light within the heart is declared to be so. This likewise is shown to relate to the supreme one, unaffected by worldly course.\n\nIt had been intimated in an early aphorism of the first chapter, that the v\u00e9das, being rightly interpreted, do concur in the same import, as there\n\n---\n\n* Munidaca, Br.

(S. 42, 43.)\nexpressed, concerning the omnipotent and omniscient creator of the universe.* An objection to this conclusion is raised, upon the ground of discrepancy remarked in various texts of the v\u00e9das,\u2020 which coincide, indeed, in ascribing the creation to Brahm\u00e9, but differ in the order and particulars of the world's development. The apparent contradiction is reconciled, as they agree on the essential points of the creator's attributes; omnipotent and omniscient providence, lord of all, soul of all, and without a second, &c.: and it was not the object of the discrepant passages to declare the precise succession and exact course of the world's formation.\n\nTwo more sections are devoted to expound passages which define Brahm\u00e9 as creator, and which are shown to comport no other construction. In one,\u2021 cited from a dialogue between Aj\u00e1tas'atr\u00fa and B\u00e1l\u00e1ci, surnamed G\u00e1rgya, the object of meditation and worship is pronounced to be, 'he who was the maker of those persons just before mentioned (regents of the sun, moon, &c.), and whose work this universe is.'\n\nIn the other, cited from a dialogue between Y\u00e1jnyawalcya and Maitr\u00e9yi.\u00a7 soul, and all else which is desirable, are contrasted as mutual objects of affection: 'it is for soul (\u00e1tman) that opulence, kindred, and all else which is dear, are so; and thereunto soul reciprocally is so; and such is the object which should be meditated, inquired, and known, and by knowledge of whom all becomes known.' This, it is shown, is said of the supreme, not of the individual soul, nor of the breath of life.\n\nUnder this last head several authorities are quoted by the author, for different modes of interpretation and reasoning, viz. Asmarat'hya, Audul\u00f3mi and Casacristna, as Jaimini under the next preceding (\u00a7 5).\n\nThe succeeding section|| affirms the important tenet of the V\u00e9d\u00e1nta, that the supreme being is the material, as well as the efficient, cause of the universe: it is a proposition directly resulting from the tenour of passages of the v\u00e9das, and illustrations and examples adduced.\n\nThe first lecture is terminated by an aphorism,\u00b6 intimating that, in the like manner as the opinion of a plastic nature and material cause (termed by the S\u00e1nchhyas, pradh\u00e1na) has been shown to be unsupported by the\n\n---\n\n* Br.

(Br. S\u00fbtr. 1.1. \u00a7 5 and 1.4. \u00a77.)\n\nNot to interrupt the connexion of the subjects, I have purposely passed by a digression, or rather several, comprised in two sections of this chapter,* wherein it is inquired whether any besides a regenerate man (or Hindu of the three first tribes) is qualified for theological studies and theognostic attainments; and the solution of the doubt is, that a sudra, or man of an inferior tribe, is incompetent;\u2020 and that beings superior to man (the gods of mythology) are qualified.\n\nIn the course of this disquisition the noted question of the eternity of sound, of articulate sound in particular, is mooted and examined. It is a favourite topic in both m\u00eem\u00e2ms\u00e2s, being intimately connected with that of the eternity of the veda, or revelation acknowledged by them.\n\nI shall not, however, enter into the matter further, in this place, though much remain to be added to the little which was said on it in a former essay.\u2021\n\nIn the fourth chapter of the first lecture, the author returns to the task of confuting the S\u00e2nch\u00eeya doctrine; and some passages of the v\u00e9das, apparently favouring that doctrine, are differently interpreted by him: 'the indistinct one (avyacta) is superior to the great one (mahat), and embodied soul (purusha) is superior to the indistinct.'\u00a7 Here the very same terms, which the S\u00e2nch\u00eeyas employ for 'intelligence, nature and soul,' are contrasted, with allusion seemingly to the technical acceptations of them. This passage is, however, explained away; and the terms are taken by the V\u00e9d\u00e2ntins in a different sense.\n\nThe next instance is less striking and may be briefly dismissed, as may that following it: one relative to aj\u00e2, alleged to signify in the passage in question|| the unborn sempiternal nature (pracriti), but explained to intend a luminous nature (pracriti) noticed in the Ch'h\u00e2nd\u00f4gya; (there is in the text itself an evident allusion to the ordinary acceptation of the word, a\n\n---\n\n* Br.

More than one among the sages of the law (*Devala* in particular is named) have sanctioned the principles of the *Sanc'hyya*; and they are not uncountenanced by *Menu.*\u2020 *Capila* himself is spoken of with the reverence due to a saint (*Mah\u00e1-Rishi*) and inspired sage; and his most eminent disciples, as *Panchas'ic'ha*, &c. are mentioned with like veneration; and their works are dignified with the appellations of *tantra* and *smriti* as holy writings, by the *Vedantins*, at the same time that these oppose and refute the doctrine taught by him.\n\n*Capila*, indeed, is named in the *Veda* itself as possessing transcendent knowledge; but here it is remarked, that the name has been borne by more than one sage; and in particular by *V\u00e1sudeva*, who slew the sons of *Sagara.*\u2021 This mythological personage, it is contended, is the *Capila* named in the *Veda*.\n\nThe second lecture continues the refutation of *Capila's Sanc'hyya*, which, it is observed, is at variance with the *smritis*, as with the *Vedas*: and here the name of *Menu* is placed at the head of them, although the institutes, which bear his name, will be found, as just now hinted, and as subsequently admitted in another section, to afford seeming countenance to *Sanc'hyya* doctrines. Such passages are, however, explained away by the *Vedantins*, who rely in this instance, as they do in that of the *Veda* itself, on other texts, which are not reconcileable to the *Sanc'hyya*.\n\nThe same argument is, in the following section,\u00a7 applied to the setting aside of the *Yoga-smriti* of *Patanjali* (*Hairan'ya-garbha*), so far as that is inconsistent with the orthodox tenets deduced from the *Vedas*; and, by parity of reasoning, to *Can\u00e1de's* atomical scheme; and to other systems which admit two distinct causes (a material and an efficient one) of the universe.\n\n---\n\n* Vrihad Aran. 6.

S\u00fatr. 2. 1. \u00a7 2 (S. 3.)\nThe doctrine derived from the tenour of the V\u00e9das is to be supported, likewise, by reasoning independently of authority. 'The objection, that the cause and effect are dissimilar, is not a valid one: instances of such dissimilarity are frequent. Hair and nails, which are insensible, grow from a sensible animal body; and sentient vermin (scorpions, &c.) spring from inanimate sources (cow-dung, &c.) The argument, too, might be retorted; for, according to the adverse position, sentient beings are produced from an insensible plastic nature.* On these and other arguments the orthodox doctrine is maintainable by reasoning: and by like arguments opinions concerning atoms and an universal void, which are not received by the best persons, may be confuted.'\u2020\n\n'The distinction relative to fruition, discriminating one who enjoys and that which is enjoyed, does not invalidate the singleness and identity of Brahme as cause and effect.\u00a7 The sea is one and not other than its waters; yet waves, foam, spray, drops, froth, and other modifications of it, differ from each other.'\n\n'An effect is not other than its cause. Brahme is single without a second. He is not separate from the embodied self. He is soul; and the soul is he.\u00a7 Yet he does not do that only which is agreeable and beneficial to self. The same earth exhibits diamonds, rock crystals, red orpiment &c.; the same soil produces a diversity of plants; the same food is converted into various excrescences, hair, nails, &c.\n\n'As milk changes to curd, and water to ice, so is Brahme variously transformed and diversified, without aid of tools or exterior means of any sort.|| In like manner, the spider spins his web out of his own substance; spirits assume various shapes; cranes (valiced) propagate without the male; and the lotus proceeds from pond to pond without organs of motion. That Brahme is intire without parts, is no objection: he is not wholly transformed into worldly appearances. Various changes are presented to the same dreaming soul. Divers illusory shapes and disguises are assumed by the same spirit.\u00b6\n\nBrahme is omnipotent, able for every act, without organ or instrument.** No motive or special purpose need be assigned for his creation of the universe, besides his will.\u2020\u2020\n\n* Br S\u00fbtr. 2. 1. \u00a7 3.

Every one has his lot, in the renovated world, according to his merits, his previous virtue or vice in a former stage of an universe, which is sempiternal and had no beginning in time. So the rain-cloud distributes rain impartially; yet the sprout varies according to the seed.*\n\nEvery attribute of a first cause (omniscience, omnipotence, &c.) exists in Brahme, who is devoid of qualities.\u2020\n\nThe second chapter of the second lecture is controversial. The doctrine of the S\u00e1nchhyas is confuted in the first section; that of the Vaiseshicas in two more; of the Baudhas in as many; of the Jainas in one; of the P\u00e1supatas and P\u00e1nchar\u00e1tras, likewise, in one each. These controversial disquisitions are here omitted; as a brief abstract would hardly be intelligible, and a full explanation would lead to too great length. They have been partly noticed in a separate treatise on the Philosophy of Indian Sects (vol. 1. p. 549). It is remarkable, that the Ny\u00e1ya of G\u00f3tama is entirely unnoticed in the text and commentaries of the V\u00e9d\u00e1nta-s\u00fatras.\n\nIn the third chapter of the second lecture, the task of reconciling seeming contradictions of passages in the v\u00e9das is resumed.\n\nThe origin of air and the etherial element (\u00e1c\u00e1s'a), unnoticed in the text of the v\u00e9da (Ch'h\u00e1nd\u00f3gya), where the creation of the three other elements is described, has been affirmed in another (Taittiriyaca).\u2020 The omission of the one is supplied by the notice in the other; there is no contradiction, as the deficient passage is not restrictive, nor professes a complete enumeration. Ether and air are by Brahme created. But he himself has no origin, no procreator nor maker, for he is eternal, without beginning as without end.\u00a7 So fire, and water, and earth, proceed mediately from him, being evolved successively, the one from the other, as fire from air, and this from ether.|| The element of earth is meant in divers passages where food (that is, esculent vegetable) is said to proceed from water: for rain fertilizes the earth.

Birth and death are predicated of an individual, referring merely to his association with body, which is matter fixed or moveable. Individual souls are, in the veda, compared to sparks issuing from a blazing fire; but the soul is likewise declared expressly to be eternal and unborn. Its emanation is no birth, nor original production.\u2020 It is perpetually intelligent and constantly sensible, as the S\u00e1nchhyas too maintain; not adventitiously so, merely by association with mind and intellect, as the disciples of Ca\u00f1\u00e1de insist. It is for want of sensible objects, not for want of sensibility or faculty of perception, that the soul feels not during profound sleep, fainting, or trance.\n\n'The soul is not of finite dimensions, as its transmigrations seemingly indicate; nor minutely small abiding within the heart, and no bigger than the hundredth part of a hundredth of a hair's point, as in some passages described; but, on the contrary, being identified with supreme Brahm\u00e9, it participates in his infinity.\u00a7\n\n'The soul is active; not, as the S\u00e1nchhyas maintain, merely passive.\u2016 Its activity, however, is not essential, but adventitious. As the carpenter, having his tools in hand, toils and suffers, and laying them aside, rests and is easy, so the soul in conjunction with its instruments (the senses and organs) is active, and quitting them, reposes.\u00b6\n\n'Blind in the darkness of ignorance, the soul is guided in its actions and fruition, in its attainment of knowledge and consequent liberation and bliss, by the supreme ruler of the universe,** who causes it to act conformably with its previous resolves: now, according to its former purposes, as then consonantly to its yet earlier predispositions, accruing from preceding forms with no retrospective limit; for the world had no beginning.

He does not, however, partake of the pain and suffering of which the individual soul is conscious, through sympathy, during its association with body; so solar or lunar light appears as that which it illumines, though distinct therefrom.\n\n'As the sun's image reflected in water is tremulous, quaking with the undulations of the pool, without however affecting other watery images nor the solar orb itself; so the sufferings of one individual affect not another, nor the supreme ruler. But, according to the doctrine of the S\u00e1nchhyas, who maintain that souls are numerous, each of them infinite, and all affected by one plastic principle, nature (pradh\u00e1na or pracriti), the pain or pleasure, which is experienced by one, must be felt by all. The like consequence is objected to the doctrine of Ca\u0144\u00e1de, who taught that souls, numerous and infinite, are of themselves insensible; and mind, the soul's instrument, is minute as an atom, and by itself likewise unsentient. The union of one soul with a mind would not exclude its association with other souls, equally infinite and ubiquitous; and all, therefore, would partake of the same feeling of pain or pleasure.'\n\nThe fourth chapter of the second book proceeds in the task of reconciling apparent contradictions of passages in the v\u00e9das.\u00a7\n\n'The corporeal organs of sense and of action, designated by the term pr\u00e1n'a in a secondary acceptation (it is noticed in its proper signification further on, \u00a7 4), have, like the elements and other objects treated of in the foregoing chapter, a similar origin, as modifications of Brahme; although unnoticed in some passages concerning the creation, and mentioned in others as pre-existent, but expressly affirmed in others to be successively evolved.\u00a7 The deficiency or omission of one text does not invalidate the explicit tenour of another.\n\n* Br.

S\u00fatr. 2. 4. \u00a7 1. (S. 1-4.)\nIn various passages, the number of corporeal organs is differently stated, from seven to thirteen. The precise number is, however, eleven:* the five senses, sight, &c.; five active organs, the hand, &c.; and lastly, the internal faculty, mind, comprehending intelligence, consciousness, and sensation. Where a greater number is specified, the term is employed in its most comprehensive sense; where fewer are mentioned, it is used in a more restricted acceptation: thus seven sensitive organs are spoken of, relatively to the eyes, ears, and nostrils (in pairs), and the tongue.\n\nThey are finite and small: not, however, minute as atoms, nor yet gross, as the coarser elements.\u2020\n\nIn its primary or principal signification, pr\u0101\u1e47a is vital action, and chiefly respiration. This, too, is a modification of BRAHM\u00c9. It is not wind (v\u0101yu) or the air which is breathed, though so described in numerous passages of the v\u00e9das and other authorities; nor is it an operation of a corporeal organ; but it is a particular vital act, and comprehends five such: 1st respiration, or an act operating upwards; 2d inspiration, one operating downwards; 3d a vigorous action, which is a mean between the foregoing two; 4th expiration, or passage upwards, as in metempsychosis; 5th digestion, or circulation of nutriment throughout the corporeal frame.\u2021\n\nHere, too, it must be understood of a limited, not vast or infinite act, nor minutely small. The vital act is not so minute as not to pervade the entire frame, as in the instance of circulation of nourishment; yet is small enough to be imperceptible to a bystander, in the instance of life's passage in transmigration.\n\nRespiration and the rest of the vital acts do not take effect of themselves by an intrinsic faculty, but as influenced and directed by a presiding deity and ruling power, yet relatively to a particular body, to whose animating spirit, and not to the presiding deity, fruition accrues.\u00a7\n\nThe senses and organs, eleven in number as above mentioned, are not modifications of the principal vital act, respiration, but distinct principles.||\n\nIt is the supreme ruler, not the individual soul, who is described in passages of the v\u00e9das as transforming himself into divers combinations, assuming various names and shapes, deemed terrene, aqueous, or igneous,\n\n* Br.

When nourishment is received into the corporeal frame, it undergoes a threefold distribution, according to its fineness or coarseness: corn and other terrene food becomes flesh; but the coarser portion is ejected, and the finer nourishes the mental organ. Water is converted into blood; the coarser particles are rejected as urine; the finer supports the breath. Oil or other combustible substance, deemed igneous, becomes marrow; the coarser part is deposited as bone, and the finer supplies the faculty of speech.*\n\nThe third lecture treats on the means whereby knowledge is attainable, through which liberation and perpetual bliss may be achieved: and, as preliminary thereto, on the passage of the soul furnished with organs into the versatile world and its various conditions; and on the nature and attributes of the supreme being.\n\n'The soul is subject to transmigration. It passes from one state to another, invested with a subtile frame consisting of elementary particles, the seed or rudiment of a grosser body. Departing from that which it occupied, it ascends to the moon; where, clothed with an aqueous form, it experiences the recompense of its works; and whence it returns to occupy a new body with resulting influence of its former deeds. But evil-doers suffer for their misdeeds in the seven appointed regions of retribution.'\n\n'The returning soul quits its watery frame in the lunar orb, and passes successively and rapidly through ether, air, vapour, mist, and cloud, into rain; and thus finds its way into a vegetating plant, and thence, through the medium of nourishment, into an animal embryo.'\n\nIn the second chapter of this lecture the states or conditions of the embodied soul are treated of. They are chiefly three; waking, dreaming, and profound sleep: to which may be added for a fourth, that of death; and for a fifth, that of trance, swoon, or stupor, which is intermediate between profound sleep and death (as it were half-dead), as dreaming is between waking and profound sleep. In that middle state of dreaming there is a fanciful course of events, an illusory creation, which however testifies the existence of a conscious soul. In profound sleep the soul has retired to the supreme one by the route of the arteries of the pericardium.\u00a7\n\nThe remainder of this chapter is devoted to the consideration of the\n\n---\n\n* Br.

'He is described in many passages of the veda, as diversified and endued with every quality and particular character; but in other and very numerous texts, as without form or quality. The latter only is truly applicable, not the former, nor yet both. He is impassible, unaffected by worldly modifications; as the clear crystal, seemingly coloured by the red blossom of a hibiscus, is not the less really pellucid. He does not vary with every disguising form or designation, for all diversity is expressly denied by explicit texts; and the notion of variableness relative to him is distinctly condemned in some sacchas of the veda.*\n\n'He is neither coarse nor subtile, neither long nor short, neither audible nor tangible; amorphous, invariable.'\n\n'This luminous immortal being, who is in this earth, is the same with the luminous, immortal, embodied spirit, which informs the corporeal self, and is the same with the [supreme] soul.' 'He is to be apprehended by mind alone, there is not here any multiplicity. Whosoever views him as manifold dies death after death.'\n\n'He is amorphous, for so he is explicitly declared to be; but seemingly assuming form, as sunshine or moonlight, impinging on an object, appears straight or crooked.'\n\n'He is pronounced to be sheer sense, mere intellect and thought: as a lump of salt is wholly of an uniform taste within and without, so is the soul an entire mass of intelligence.' This is affirmed both in the vedas and in the smritis: and, as such, he is compared to the reflected images of sun and moon, which fluctuate with the rise and fall of the waters that reflect them.\u00a7 'The luminous sun, though single, yet reflected in water, becomes various; and so does the unborn divine soul by disguise in divers modes.'\n\nThe veda so describes him, as entering into and pervading the corporeal shapes by himself wrought.|| 'He framed bodies, biped and quadruped; and becoming a bird, he passed into those bodies, filling them as their informing spirit.'\n\nIn the Vrihad aranyaca, after premising two modes of Brahme, morphous and amorphous; one composed of the three coarser elements, earth, water,\n\n* Br.

But since both are affirmed, the relation is as that of the coiled serpent fancied to be a hoop; or as that of light and the luminary from which it proceeds, for both are luminous.\u00a7\n\n* There is none other but he, notwithstanding the apparent import of divers texts, which seem to imply differences, various relations, and aliquot parts. He is ubiquitary and eternal; for he is pronounced to be greater than etherial space, which is infinite.||\n\n* The fruit or recompense of works is from him, for that is congruous; and so it is expressly affirmed in the v\u00e9das. Jaimini alleges virtue or moral merit; but the author of the s\u00fatras (Badar\u00e1yana vy\u00e1sa) maintains the former, because the supreme being is in the v\u00e9das termed the cause of virtue and of vice, as of every thing else.'\u00b6\n\nThe two last chapters of the third lecture relate chiefly to devout exercises and pious meditation, the practice of which is inculcated as proper and requisite to prepare the soul and mind for the reception of divine knowledge, and to promote its attainment. I pass rapidly over this copious part** of the text, for the same reason for which I restricted myself to a very brief notice of the Y\u00f3ga or theistical S\u00e1nchhya of Patanjali; because religious observances are more concerned than philosophy with the\n\n---\n\n* Br.

In general, but not always, the same divine knowledge, the same worship, and like meditations, are intended by the same designations in different v\u0113das, the omissions and obscurities of one being supplied and explained by another, and even under various designations. By the acquisition of such knowledge, attainable as it is in the present or in a future birth, in lifetime, or to take effect after death, the influence of works is annulled, and consequent deliverance is single, not varying in degree and inducing different gradations of bliss, but complete and final happiness.\n\nThe fourth lecture relates chiefly to the fruit and effect of pious meditation properly conducted, and the consequent attainment of divine knowledge. The beginning of the first chapter is, however, supplemental to the foregoing lecture, treating of devout exercises, and the posture (a sitting one) in which devotion and contemplation should be practised, with constant repetition of those observances, and persisting therein during life.*\n\nSo soon as that knowledge is attained, past sin is annulled and future offence precluded.\u2020 \"As water wets not the leaf of the lotus, so sin touches not him who knows God: as the floss on the carding comb cast into the fire is consumed, so are his sins burnt away.\"\u2021\n\n\"In like manner, the effect of the converse (that is, of merit and virtue) is by acquisition of knowledge annulled and precluded. It is at death that these consequences take place.\u00a7 \"He traverses both (merit and demerit) thereby.\"|| \"The heart's knot is broken, all doubts are split, and his works perish, when he has seen the supreme being.\"\u00b6 \"All sins\n\n* Br.

It chiefly concerns the ascent of the soul, or mode in which it passes from the body.\n\n'Of a dying person the speech, followed by the rest of the ten exterior faculties (not the corporeal organs themselves), is absorbed into the mind, for the action of the outer organ ceases before the mind's.

Breath, attended likewise by all other vital faculties, is withdrawn into the living soul which governs the corporeal organs, as the attendants of a king assemble around him when he is setting out upon a journey; for all vital functions gather about the soul at the last moment when it is expiring.\u2020\n\nThe living soul, attended with all its faculties, retires within a rudiment of body, composed of light with the rest of the five elements, in a subtile state. \"Breath\" is, therefore, said to withdraw into \"light;\" not meaning that element (or fire) exclusively; nor intending direct transition, for a traveller has gone from one city to another, though he passed through an intermediate town.\n\nThis retirement from the body is common to ordinary uninformed people as to the devout contemplative worshipper, until they proceed further on their respective paths; and immortality (without immediate reunion with the supreme Brahma) is the fruit of pious meditation, though impediments may not be wholly consumed and removed.\u2021\n\nIn that condition the soul of the contemplative worshipper remains united to a subtile elementary frame, conjoined with the vital faculties, until the dissolution of worlds, when it merges in the supreme deity. That elementary frame is minute in its dimensions as subtile in its texture, and is accordingly imperceptible to bystanders when departing from the body: nor is it oppressed by cremation or other treatment which that body undergoes. It is by its warmth sensible so long as it abides with that coarser frame, which becomes cold in death when it has departed,\u00a7 and was warm during life while it remained.\n\nBut he who has attained the true knowledge of God does not pass through the same stages of retreat, proceeding directly to reunion with the supreme being, with which he is identified, as a river, at its confluence with the sea, merges therein altogether. His vital faculties and the elements of which his body consists, all the sixteen component parts which constitute the human frame, are absorbed absolutely and completely: both name and form cease; and he becomes immortal, without parts or members.\u00b6\n\n* Ch'h\u00e1nd\u00f3gya.

A hundred and one arteries issue from the heart, one of which passes to the crown of the head: it is named sushumna. By that passage, in virtue of acquired knowledge, and of recollection of the meditated way, the soul of the wise, graced by the favour of Brahm\u00e9, whose dwelling is in the heart, issues and meets a solar ray; and by that route proceeds, whether it be night or day, winter or summer.+ The contact of a sunbeam with the vein is constant, as long as the body endures: rays of light reach from the sun to the vein, and conversely extend from this to the sun. The preferableness of summer, as exemplified in the case of Bhishma, who awaited the return of that auspicious season to die, does not concern the devout worshipper, who has practised religious exercises in contemplation of Brahm\u00e9, as inculcated by the v\u00e9das, and has consequently acquired knowledge. But it does concern those who have followed the observances taught by the S\u00e1nchya Y\u00f3ga; according to which, the time of day and season of the year are not indifferent.\n\nThe further progress of the soul, from the termination of the coronal artery communicating with a solar ray to its final destination, the abode of Brahm\u00e9, is variously described in divers texts of the v\u00e9da; some specifying intermediate stations which are omitted by others, or mentioned in a different order.\u00a7 The seeming discrepancies of those passages are reconciled, and all are shown to relate to one uniform route, deduced from the text, for the divine journey (d\u00e9va-y\u00e1na) which the liberated soul travels. A question arises, whether the intermediate stations, which are mentioned, be stages of the journey, or scenes of fruition to be visited in succession, or\n\n* Rangan\u00e1tha on Br.

Jaimini affirms the supreme one to be meant: but B\u0101dari maintains the other opinion; which is that which the commentators of the s\u016btras understand the author of them to adopt.\u00a7\n\nThe souls of those holy persons only, whose devout meditation was addressed to the pure Brahm\u0113 himself, take the route described;\u00a7 not those whose contemplation was partial and restrictive: they have their special reward. Those, too, whose knowledge of God was more perfect, pass immediately, or by any route, to a reunion with the divinity, with whom they are identified.\n\nThe soul of him who has arrived at the perfection of divine knowledge, and is consequently liberated, \u201cquitting its corporeal frame, ascends to the\n\n---\n\n* Bh\u0101vadeva instances P\u0101talipura and the S\u014dna river, as indicated for the direction of the route from Tirabhucti (Tirhut) to V\u0101r\u0101nasi (Benares). It is clear that he understands P\u0101talipura (the ancient Palibothra) to be Patna.\n\n\u2020 Br. S\u0101tr. 4. 3, \u00a7 1-4. (S. 1-6.)\n\n\u2021 Ibid. \u00a7 5.

Audulomi insisted, that he becomes sheer thought, sentient intelligence. The author of the s\u016btras (B\u0101dar\u0101ya\u1e47a) accedes to the last-mentioned opinion; admitting, however, the practical or apparent possession of divine faculties by one who has attained perfection of knowledge.\n\n\u2018By certain devout exercises and meditation\u2021 a less perfect knowledge is acquired, which, as before mentioned, qualifies the possessor of it for reception at Brahme\u2019s abode, though not for immediate reunion and identity with his being. In that condition transcendent power is enjoyed. The pitris, or shades of progenitors, may be called up by a simple act of the will; and other superhuman faculties may be similarly exerted. The possessor of these is independent, subject to no other\u2019s control. He may, at his option, be invested with one or more bodies, furnished with senses and organs, or be unincumbered with a corporeal frame. On this point, however, a difference of doctrine subsists. Jaimini maintained the indispensable presence of body; B\u0101dari, its absence; and the author (B\u0101dar\u0101ya\u1e47a) admits the option. In one case, the condition is that of a person dreaming; in the other case, as of one awake.\u00a7\n\n\u2018Master of several bodies, by a simple act of his will, the Yogi does not occupy one only, leaving the rest inanimate, like so many wooden machines. He may animate more than one, in like manner as a single lamp may be made to supply more than one wick.\u2016\n\nLiberation (mucti), besides its proper and strict sense, which is that of final deliverance through a perfect knowledge of Brahme, and consequent identification with the divinity and absorption into his essence, is likewise employed in a secondary acceptation for that which takes effect in life-time (j\u012bvan-mucti); or which conducts the soul after death to dwell with Brahme; not, however, divested of a subtile corporeal frame.

At the consummation of all things, all are resolved into him; as the spider spins his thread from his own substance and gathers it in again; as vegetables sprout from the soil and return to it, earth to earth; as hair and nails grow from a living body and continue with it. The supreme being is one, sole-existent, secondless, entire, without parts, sempiternal, infinite, ineffable, invariable ruler of all, universal soul, truth, wisdom, intelligence, happiness.\n\nIndividual souls, emanating from the supreme one, are likened to innumerable sparks issuing from a blazing fire. From him they proceed, and to him they return, being of the same essence. The soul, which governs the body, together with its organs, neither is born; nor does it die. It is a portion of the divine substance; and, as such, infinite, immortal, intelligent, sentient, true.\n\nIt is governed by the supreme. Its activity is not of its essence, but inductive through its organs: as an artisan, taking his tools, labours and undergoes toil and pain, but laying them aside reposes; so is the soul active, and a sufferer by means of its organs; but, divested of them, and returning to the supreme one, is at rest and is happy. It is not a free and independent agent, but made to act by the supreme one, who causes it to do in one state as it had purposed in a former condition. According to its predisposition for good or evil, for enjoined or forbidden deeds, it is made to do good or ill, and thus it has retribution for previous works. Yet God is not author of evil; for so it has been from eternity: the series of preceding forms and of dispositions manifested in them has been infinite.\n\nThe soul is incased in body as in a sheath, or rather in a succession of sheaths. The first or inner case is the intellectual one (vijn\u0101namaya): it is composed of the sheer (tan-m\u0101tra), or simple elements uncombined, and consists of the intellect (buddhi) joined with the five senses.\n\nThe next is the mental (manomaya) sheath, in which mind is joined with the preceding. A third sheath or case comprises the organs of action and the vital faculties, and is termed the organic or vital case. These three sheaths (c\u0101\u015ba) constitute the subtile frame (\u015b\u016bchma-s'ar\u012bra or linga-s'ar\u012bra) which attends the soul in its transmigrations. The interior rudiment confined to the inner case is the causal frame (c\u0101ran'a-s'ar\u012bra).\n\nThe gross body (sth\u016bla-s'ar\u012bra) which it animates from birth to death in any step of its transmigrations, is composed of the coarse elements, formed\nby combinations of the simple elements, in proportions of four-eighths of the predominant and characteristic one with an eighth of each of the other four: that is, the particles of the several elements, being divisible, are, in the first place, split into moieties; whereof one is subdivided into quarters; and the remaining moiety combines with one part (a quarter of a moiety) from each of the four others, thus constituting coarse or mixed elements.*\n\nThe exterior case, composed of elements so combined, is the nutrimentitious (annamaya) sheath; and being the scene of coarse fruition, is therefore termed the gross body.\n\nThe organic frame assimilates the combined elements received in food, and secretes the finer particles and rejects the coarsest: earth becomes flesh; water, blood; and inflammable substances (oil or grease), marrow. The coarser particles of the two first are excreted as feces and urine; those of the third are deposited in the bones. The finer particles of the one nourish the mind; of the other, supply respiration; of the third, support speech.\n\nOrganized bodies are arranged by the v\u00e9d\u00e1ntins in either four or three classes: for both which arrangements the authority of passages of the veda is cited. Their four classes are the same with those of other writers; but the threefold division appears to be peculiar to this school. It is, 1st. viviparous (jivaja), as man and quadrupeds; 2d. oviparous (an'd'a'ja), as birds and insects; 3d. germiniparous (udbhijja).\u2020 The latter, however, comprehends the two terminating classes of the fourfold distribution, vermin and vegetable; differing but as one sprouts from the earth, the other pullulates from water: the one fixed, the other locomotive. To both, equivocal and spontaneous generation, or propagation without union of parents, is assigned.\n\nThe order in which the five elements are enumerated is that of their development: 1st. the etherial element (\u00e1c\u00e1s'a), which is deemed a most subtile fluid, occupying all space and confounded with vacancy: sound is its particular quality. 2d. Wind (v\u00e1yu), or air in motion: for mobility is its characteristic; sound and feel are sensible in it. 3d. Fire or light (t\u00e9ljas), of which heat is the characteristic; and by which sound, feel, and colour (or form) are made manifest. 4th. Water (ap), of which fluidity is characteristic; and in which sound, feel, colour, and taste occur. 5th. Earth (prithiv\u00ed or anna), of which hardness is characteristic; and in which sound, feel, colour, taste, and smell are discernible.\n\n* V\u00e9d. S\u00e1ra. 136. \u2020 S'anc., &c. on Br. S\u00fatr. 3. 1. \u00a7 3. (S. 21.)\nThe notion of ether and wind as distinct elements, an opinion which this has in common with most of the other schools of Indian philosophy, seems to originate in the assumption of mobility for the essential character of the one. Hence air in motion has been distinguished from the aerial fluid at rest, which is \u00e1ca\u015b'a, supposed to penetrate and pervade all worldly space; and, by an easy transition, v\u00e1yu (wind) and motion, come to be identified, as \u00e1ca\u015b'a (ether) and space likewise are confounded.\n\nAn organized body, in its most subtile state of tenuity, comprises sixteen members (avyaya) or corporeal parts, viz. five organs of sense, as many instruments of action, and the same number of vital faculties; to which are added mind (including intelligence, consciousness, and sensation); or, distinguishing mind and intellect (buddhi) as separate parts, the number is seventeen.\n\nThe vital faculties, termed v\u00e1yu, are not properly air or wind, but vital functions or actions. Considered, however, with a reference to the proper meaning of that term, they are by some explained to be, 1st respiration, which is ascending, and of which the seat is the nostril; 2d, inspiration (or otherwise explained, flatus), which is descending, and which issues from the lower extremity of the intestine; 3d, flatuousness, which is diffused through the body, passing by all the veins and arteries; 4th, expiration, ascending from the throat; 5th, digestion, or abdominal air, of which the seat is the middle of the body.\n\nAccording to a different explanation, the first is respiration; the second, inspiration; the third, a mean between the two, pulsation, palpitation, and other vital movements; the fourth is expiration; and the fifth is digestion.\n\nThree states of the soul in respect of the body are recognized; to which must be added a fourth, and even a fifth, viz. waking, dreaming, profoundly sleeping, half-dead, and dead. While awake, the soul, associated with body, is active under the guidance of providence, and has to do with a real (p\u00e1ram\u00e1rl'hic\u00ed) and practical (vyavah\u00e1ric\u00ed) creation. In a dream there is an illusory (m\u00e1y\u00e1may\u00ed) and unreal creation: nevertheless, dreams prognosticate events. Dreaming is the mean (sandhya) between sleeping and waking. In profound sleep the soul is absent, having retired by the channel of the arteries, and being as it were enfolded in the supreme deity. It is not, however, blended with the divine essence, as a drop of water fallen into a lake, where it becomes undistinguishable; but, on the contrary, the soul continues discriminate, and returns unchanged to the body which it ani-\nmates while awake. Swoon, or stupor, is intermediate between sleep and death. During insensibility produced by accident or disease, there is, as in profound sleep and lethargy, a temporary absence of the soul. In death it has absolutely quitted its gross corporeal frame.\n\nSubject to future transmigration, it visits other worlds, to receive there the recompense of works or suffer the penalty of misdeeds. Sinners fall to various regions of punishment, administered by Chitr\u0101gupta and other mythological persons in the realm of Yama. The virtuous rise to the moon, where they enjoy the fruit of their good actions; and whence they return to this world to animate new bodies, and act in them, under providence, conformably with their propensities and predispositions, the trace of which remains.\n\nThe wise, liberated from worldly trammels, ascend yet higher, to the abode and court of Brahm\u00e9; or, if their attainment of wisdom be complete, they at once pass into a reunion with the divine essence.\n\nThree degrees of liberation or deliverance (mucti) are distinguished: one incorporeal, which is that last-mentioned, and is complete; another imperfect, which is that before-mentioned, taking effect upon demise, when the soul passes to the highest heaven, the abode of Brahm\u00e9. The third is effectual in life-time (jivan mucti), and enables the possessor of it to perform supernatural actions; as evocation of shades of progenitors, translation of himself into other bodies called into existence by the mere force of his will, instantaneous removal to any place at his pleasure, and other wondrous performances.\n\nThese several degrees of deliverance are achieved by means of certain sacrifices, as that of a horse (as'wamedha), or by religious exercises in various prescribed modes, together with pious meditation on the being and attributes of God; but the highest degree of it is attainable only by perfect knowledge of the divine nature, and of the identity of God with that which emanated from him, or was created of his substance and partakes of his essence.\n\nQuestions most recondite, which are agitated by theologians, have engaged the attention of the v\u00e9d\u00e1ntins likewise, and have been by them discussed at much length; such as free-will (sw\u00e1tantrja), divine grace (is'vara-pras\u00e1da), efficacy of works (carman) or of faith (s'radh\u00e1), and many other abstruse points.\n\nOn the last-mentioned topic, that of faith, nothing will be found in the\ntext of B\u0101dar\u0101ya\u1e47a, and little in the gloss of S'\u0101ncara. Its paramount efficacy is a tenet of another branch of the V\u00e9d\u00e1nta school, which follows the authority of the Bhagavad-g\u012bt\u0101. In that work, as in many of the Pur\u0101\u1e47as, passages relative to this topic recur at every turn.\n\nThe fruit of works is the grand subject of the first m\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101, which treats of religious duties, sacrifices, and other observances.\n\nThe latter m\u012bm\u0101\u1e41s\u0101 more particularly maintains the doctrine of divine grace. It treats of free-will, which it in effect denies; but endeavours to reconcile the existence of moral evil under the government of an all-wise, all-powerful, and benevolent providence, with the absence of free-will, by assuming the past eternity of the universe, and the infinite renewals of worlds into which every individual being has brought the predispositions contracted by him in earlier states, and so retrospectively without beginning or limit.\n\nThe notion, that the versatile world is an illusion (m\u0101y\u0101), that all which passes to the apprehension of the waking individual is but a phantasy presented to his imagination, and every seeming thing is unreal and all is visionary, does not appear to be the doctrine of the text of the V\u00e9d\u00e1nta. I have remarked nothing which countenances it in the s\u016btras of Vy\u0101sa nor in the gloss of S'\u0101ncara, but much concerning it in the minor commentaries and in elementary treatises. I take it to be no tenet of the original V\u00e9d\u0101ntin philosophy, but of another branch, from which later writers have borrowed it, and have intermixed and confounded the two systems. The doctrine of the early V\u00e9d\u00e1nta is complete and consistent, without this graft of a later growth.\nII. Description of the Ruins of Buddha G\u00e1ya. By Dr. Francis Buchanan Hamilton, M.R.A.S.\n\n(Extracted from his Report of a Survey of South Bihar.)\n\nRead May 5, 1827.\n\nBuddha G\u00e1ya was probably, at one time, the centre of religion in India, and the residence of a powerful king. I am informed by the mahanta of the San\u00f1y\u00e1s\u00eds, who now possesses the great convent at the place, that when his predecessor Ch\u00e9tan Giri came, which may be perhaps one hundred and twenty years ago, it was entirely overrun with bushes and trees; and the sect of Buddha, in its vicinity, may be considered as completely extinct. A few persons, indeed, come occasionally from distant countries to visit its ancient monuments. Last year (1811) a man of some rank, with several attendants, came from a country called Tamsa-dwip-mah\u00e1-amarapura-paig\u00fa, sent by Mah\u00e1-dharma-r\u00e1j\u00e1, in the sixty-seventh year of his age, a Cshatriya of the family of the sun. This is, no doubt, the king of the Burmas; and hence we infer that the old man, since the year 1795, when I visited his capital, has been induced to set up the doctrine afresh. In the year 1795 the priests of Buddha were seriously alarmed at the influence which the Br\u00e1hmans had then acquired.\n\nSome years before, the king of Ava sent two messengers, who, in speaking Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed, called themselves Vaz\u00edrs, by which I know they meant officers of government. They were in search of the holy places rendered remarkable by the actions of Gautama, and took with them the water of many sacred streams and pools, to form a bath for their master.\n\nBoth these people had books, by the assistance of which they pretended to trace the holy places and to detail their history.\n\nIt would appear that the San\u00f1y\u00e1s\u00eds have, in some degree, been infected with the superstition of the place, and confounded by its numerous images, which have struck them with awe. The first mahanta resided in the ruin of the temple; and his successors have purposely erected several small buildings, both near the old temple and in their convent, where they have\nplaced many of the most remarkable and entire images; and they have put in the walls of the buildings raised for other purposes, a still greater number, of both images and inscriptions. This, the mahanta says, was done partly with a view to ornament, and partly with a view to preserve the images from injury; both of which views might have been unaccompanied by religious awe: but that this last has had some effect, I am persuaded, from several circumstances: 1st, the mahanta always spoke of Gautama by the names of Muni, or Bhagav\u00e1n, the former signifying holy, and the latter, deity. 2dly, he continued to harbour and support one of his sanny\u00e1sis, who had been converted by the messengers from Ava, and now altogether rejects the doctrines of the orthodox. (This person accompanied me to such of the places in the district as had been pointed out to him as holy by the messengers from Ava, and told me what he recollected of their discourse.) 3dly, the mahanta gives an allowance to a family of R\u00e1jputs which acts as p\u00faj\u00e1ris to the temple; and not only takes care of various small buildings erected by his predecessors among the ruins, and of the sacred tree, but offers flowers and water to Mah\u00e1muni, and preserves the image from injury. These R\u00e1jputs are orthodox, and reconcile their duty to their consciences by having given orthodox names to all the images of which they have charge, and by considering Mah\u00e1muni as an incarnation of Vishnu.\n\nIn my account of the religion of the Burmas,* it is mentioned that four great lawgivers, or gods of the sect of Buddha, have appeared on this earth; and, according to the Italian orthography of the missionary Sangermanno, these persons are named Chauchaom, Gonagom, Gaopa, and Godama; the doctrine of the latter being alone followed in that country. In Ceylon the same is the case; and the names of the four lawgivers, according to Captain Mahony's orthography,\u2020 are Kakoosandeh, Konagammeh, Kaserjeppe, and Gautemeh. These names are, no doubt, the same with those given above, only differently corrupted; but the appellations assigned to the four lawgivers of the sect by the converted sanny\u00e1si are very different. He calls them Mah\u00e1muni, Ch\u00e1nd\u00e1mun\u00ed, S\u00e1kyamun\u00ed, and Gautamamuni; all of whom were Buddhas, that is, very holy persons: but there have been many other such persons; and he says that, as Buddha is merely a title common to many, it is highly improper to speak of such a person as Buddha having been born at such or such a time, or having performed certain actions; and, in fact,\n\n* As. Res. vol. vi. p. 269. \u2020 Ibid. vol. vii. p. 32.\nwhen I was in Ava, I very seldom heard the term Buddha used. The same would also seem to be the case in Ceylon: for although Captain Mahony generally calls Gautama by the name of Boodha, yet that is probably in compliance with the common custom of the Hindus: and in his account there is a passage (p. 39) which would seem to condemn the practice as improper. In the Amarak\u00f3sha this doctrine mentioned by the convert is also fully implied. Gautama is not mentioned among the synonyms of Buddha, which are, Sarvagna, Sugata, Buddha, Dharmardja, Tath\u00e1gata, Samantabhadra, Bhagav\u00e1n, M\u00e1rqjit, Locajit, Jina, Shatabhigna, Da\u015babala, Adv\u00e1yavadi, Vind\u00fdaka, Mun\u00edndra, Sr\u00edvvanah, S\u00e1st\u00e1, and Mun\u00ed, but he is called a Muni, and might have been in the same manner called a Buddha, a Bhagaw\u00e1n, or any other of the above-mentioned synonyms; but, in speaking of him, such appellations should be joined to some of his various names, as S\u00e1kyamuni, Gautama-Buddha, or the like. These names, by which Gautama is known according to the Amarak\u00f3sha, are S\u00e1kyamuni, S\u00e1kyasimha, Sarv\u00e1rtasiddha, Sauddh\u00f3dani, Gautama, Arkabandhu, and the son of M\u00e1y\u00e1devi. It must be observed, that in the commentary (tik\u00e1) annexed, this person is said to have been descended from S\u00e1kya, who by the convert is called the third lawgiver of the Buddhas, and must not be confounded with his descendant, one of whose names is, indeed, very similar.\n\nAmong the orthodox Hindus, Buddha is not considered as synonymous with Bhagav\u00e1n, a deity, or Muni, a saint, but is always spoken of as one personage, an incarnation of Vishnu; and in an inscription found at Buddha G\u00e1ya, of which a translation has been published in the Asiatic Researches (vol. i. p. 284), this is fully stated. It is, therefore, mentioned by the author of the inscription, that Buddha, the incarnation of a part of Vishnu, and the same with Hari, appeared at the commencement of the Kali-yug, in a wild and dreadful forest, and that Amara, one of the nine jewels of the court of Vikram\u00e1ditya, having discovered this place of the supreme being in the forest, caused an image to be made and a holy temple to be constructed; and therein were set up the divine foot of Vishnu, the images of the P\u00e1ndus, of Brahm\u00e1, and the rest of the divinities. This place, according to the inscription, is called Buddha G\u00e1ya, and the forefathers of him who shall perform the \u015braddha at this place shall obtain salvation, as is mentioned in the V\u00e1yu-pur\u00e1n. And that it may be known by a self-evident testimony that Amara erected the house of Buddha, the author of the inscription has recorded the event on a stone, in the year of the era of Vikrama\nAs Amara and Vikrama are usually considered contemporary, and as the circumstance is expressly stated in the inscription, it might be considered as very strange, how an inscription engraved 1005 years after the time of Amara could be considered as a testimony of that person having erected the temple; but Mr. Bentley, in his treatise in the eighth volume of the Asiatic Researches (page 242), has shown that Amara lived long after the commencement of the era of Vikrama, and not far from the time here assigned; it may therefore be alleged, that the inscription was made by Amara, and that this person built the temple of Mahamuni. That Amara may have built the present temple is very probable; but that he could have composed this inscription, appears to me impossible. It mentions that, in the temple built by Amara, that person placed images of five sons of Pandu; but the small building containing these is evidently a very recent work, in which some old images of the Buddhas have been placed, and now named after these heroes. Besides if Amara built the great temple, he must have been of the sect of Buddha; and the story of a Buddha-Avat\u00e1r is considered by these heretics as altogether void of truth. That Amara was not orthodox, I am told, is clear, from his having omitted, in the beginning of the Amarak\u00f3sha, to use any sign of a true believer. And that he was of the sect of the Buddhas, I am assured, is proved, by the synonyms which, as I have mentioned above, he gives for a Buddha and for Gautama; and farther, these synonyms are not compatible with his having been the author of the inscription in question. I have no doubt, therefore, that this inscription is modern, and was composed by some person of the sect of Vishnu, and has been erected to account for the continuance of the worship paid at this place to the pippali tree, which, in compliance with ancient superstition, has been ordered in the G\u00e1ya Mah\u00e1tmya. I presume that it is on some such authority as this, that certain theorists have imagined the followers of the Buddhas to be a branch of the sect of Vishnu. The inscription in question has probably been removed by the person who transmitted a copy to the Asiatic Researches, as I met with none such.\n\nThe sect of Buddha, as well as the orthodox Hindus, believe that this earth is now in the fourth age of its existence, and that another age will come. Each age has had a lawgiver; and Gautama's authority, according to the Burmas and Ceylonese, is now established. They therefore commence the Kali-yug, or fourth age, with his appearance; and the different systems on that subject have occasioned various periods to be assigned for\nthat event. It was agreed by both of the parties that came from Ava, that Gautama resided at Buddha Gay\u00e1, and that, at his desire, a temple was built by Dharm\u0101soka, king of P\u0101daripuk, who held his court at the place. The visitant who came last, according to the Mahanta, placed this event, or the commencement of the Kali-yug, about 2,100 years before the year 1811, while the convert gave 5,000 years for the era. This latter date was evidently in conformity with the opinions prevailing now in India, the convert being unwilling to cede in antiquity to the pretensions of the Br\u0101hmans. The computations of Ceylon and Siam place Gautama in the sixth century before the birth of Christ, which I take to be his real era; for the Mahanta said that he could not speak with precision concerning the date which his visitors from Ava gave, as he had omitted to take it in writing. It is said by the convert, that the temple is not dedicated to Gautama but to Mah\u0101muni, or the earliest lawgiver of the present earth: and he said that the messengers from Ava merely venerated the place on account of its having been the residence of Gautama, considering the influence of Mah\u0101muni to be extinct.\n\nThat a temple may have been built here in the time of Gautama, and that it may have been dedicated to Mah\u0101muni, and that perhaps some of its remains may be found among the ruins, is highly probable; but that the present edifice is so ancient, is more than doubtful. I think it, however, probable that, from that time, the temple did not go entirely to ruin until the overthrow of the P\u00e1l R\u0101jas, and was repaired, or perhaps in a great measure rebuilt, from time to time, as it went to decay, being the chief seat of the religion which seems for many ages to have predominated in this country; on which account it was called Mah\u0101buddha by the messengers from Ava. The tradition, already mentioned, of a temple having been built by Amarasingha, in the tenth century of the Christian era, seems to me exceedingly probable, if referred to the great building which is now in the last stage of decay compatible with anything like a preservation of original form.\n\nI now proceed to mention the present appearance of the ruins, which are situated a few hundred yards west from the Nitaj\u00e1n river, on a plain of great extent. They consist of two parts, situated north and south from each other.* That to the north is the largest, being 1,482 feet by\n\n* A plan of the ruins is deposited in the East-India Company's Museum (No. 77).\n1,006 in its greatest dimensions, and is called the r\u00e1jasth\u00e1n or palace. On the east, north, and west faces, are traces of a ditch; and on the west and south are remains of an outer wall or rampart, with the appearance of there having been a ditch between it and the palace: but by far the greater part of the building seems to have been a large castle or palace, which probably contained many small courts, although these have been entirely obliterated by the operation of time. Except where there are traces of a double wall and ditch, the whole is now an uniform terrace, consisting chiefly, as is said, of bricks, but covered with soil. Nor is there any reason to suppose that the kings of Magadha ever lived here since the time of Dharma Asbka or his immediate successors. On this ruin has lately, but at different periods, been erected a building containing two temples, with an adjoining habitation. One of the temples contains the hideous Jagann\u00e1th, and was built by the father of the present occupant: the other is a temple of R\u00e1ma, built by Ganga B\u00e1\u00ed, who died a year or two ago.\n\nImmediately south from the palace, and separated from it by a road, was the temple, which has left a ruin about 800 feet from east to west, and about 480 feet from north to south. This also seems to have consisted of various courts, now mostly reduced to irregular heaps of brick and stone; for immense quantities of materials have been removed. The largest heap now remaining is at the north-east corner, where there is a very large terrace, on which are two modern small temples. The one farthest east is called V\u00e1giswari, and was erected by one of the Mahantas of the great convent of Sanny\u00e1sis. The image placed in it was dug from the ruins; and in its new name no attention has been paid even to sex, as it represents an armed male, while V\u00e1giswari is the goddess of eloquence. The history of the other temple, called that of T\u00e1r\u00e1d\u00e9vi, is similar. The image which has been selected, in place of having the form of T\u00e1r\u00e1, one of the most hideous of the female destructive powers, represents a mild-looking prince standing on a throne supported by seven Buddhas.* At the east end of this terrace, in order to procure materials for building, there is now forming a great excavation. The workmen have laid open a chamber of brick, a cube of about twenty feet, without window, door, or stair, which could only have been intended for a tomb. Although the followers of Gautama in Ava burn the dead, yet the bones and ashes are always, I\n\n* A drawing of this image is deposited at the East-India Company's Museum (No. 92).\nbelieve, buried; and I know that those of the priests, at least, are preserved in monuments: and the custom seems to have prevailed among the Buddhists of India, for the late Mr. Duncan informs us,* that in digging into extensive ruins about four miles north from Ban\u00e1ras, an inscription was found, along with some bones, in an urn, and an image of a Buddha; and Mr. Duncan rationally conjectured that these bones belong to some votary of Buddha, which indeed is confirmed by the inscription; it terminates with the sentence usual as a form of dedication on the images of this district, and mentions that Sr\u00edh\u00edra P\u00e1l, and his elder brother Basanta P\u00e1l, king of Gour, in the year 1083 of Sambat (A.D. 1062), came to K\u00e1s\u00ed, performed worship, enriched the city, and ordered all those who did not follow the Buddhas to embrace that sect. The chamber, therefore, now opened in the ruins of Mah\u00e1buddha, was in all probability a tomb.\n\nSouth from the terrace, and separated from it by a road, which is said to have been covered by an arch, and to have extended all the way to the river, has been a large range of buildings; but the greater part of the materials has been removed, and there only remain some heaps of broken bricks and images, one of which\u2020 is very large and curious. It seems to me to represent a prince who has lost his wife, and she is figured lying above his head, and attended by two mourners. The inscription contains merely the usual form of dedication. It is possible that this may have been the royal sepulchre, or at least the place where the monuments of the princes were placed. South from thence has been a small tank.\n\nThe arched road above-mentioned led between the two masses now described, into the area of the great Mandir, or shrine; the only part of the building that remains at all entire. On the right, as you enter the area, is a small chamber of brick, which contains an image, and has every appearance of being modern; which is also the case with two small chambers on the left; but one of them is evidently alluded to in the inscription given in the first volume of the Asiatic Researches, lately quoted. This, which is nearest the entrance, contains several large images, said to have been collected from various parts of the ruins, and built into the wall: five of them, representing an equal number of Buddhas, sitting in the usual manner, are commonly said to represent the five supposed sons of P\u00e1ndu.\n\n* As. Res. vol. v. p. 131.\n\u2020 East-India Company's Museum, No. 98.\nOne of them seems clearly to me a funeral monument.* The dead body is laid over the head of the Muni or Buddha, through whose favour he may be supposed to have reached the upper regions, and is accompanied by two mourners. The inscription is not thoroughly understood by my people, and some of the letters are defaced. It commences with the form of dedication usual among the Buddhas, but all that follows is interpreted in quite a different manner by each of three pandits whom I consulted.\n\nThe other small chamber is the tomb of the first Mahanta of the convent of sanny\u00e1sis.\n\nBetween these buildings and the porch of the great shrine is lying a stone, containing the impression of a Buddha's feet, and by the convert called Buddhapad; but there can be little doubt that this is the Vishnupad alluded to in the first volume of the Asiatic Researches. It has evidently been taken from the ruins, several similar having been carried thence to the convent; and round it many images have been heaped. By this mark of the deity's presence is lying a stone, which contains an inscription of considerable length.\u2020 Several of the images collected here have inscriptions. The most remarkable image\u2021 is one called Sabitr\u00ed (a goddess), but which seems to be a male votary of the Buddhas, having a Muni seated on his crown, for he resembles a prince. The inscriptions mention no person's name, but invoke the Buddhas.\n\nOn a male figure\u00a7 at the same place, now called Saraswati (a goddess), is the usual pious sentence of the Buddhists.\n\nThe great shrine, or Mandir, is a slender quadrangular pyramid of great height; but its summit is broken, and a part hangs over in a very singular manner. This spire is, on three sides, surrounded by a terrace about twenty-five or thirty feet high, and the extreme dimensions of which are seventy-eight feet wide by ninety-eight long, and one end of this terrace towards the east has covered the porch; but that has fallen, and brought down the part of the terrace by which it was covered.\n\nA stair from each side of the porch led up to the terrace, on which there was a fine walk round the temple, leading to the second story of the shrine in front, and to a large area behind, on which is planted a celebrated pippal tree (Ficus religiosa). As this is still an object of worship,\n\n* E. I. C's. Mus. No. 82.\n\u2020 Ibid. No. 113.\n\u2021 Ibid. No. 91.\n\u00a7 Ibid. No. 99.\nand frequented by pilgrims from G\u00e1y\u00e1, as I have already mentioned, the north side of the terrace has been repaired as a road; and some zealous person has lately built a stair on the outside, so that the orthodox may pass up without entering the porch, and thus seeing the hateful image of Buddha. The Mandir has been covered with plaster, some remains of which shew that it has been subdivided into numberless projecting corners, petty mouldings, and niches, each containing the image of a Buddha in plaster; and on each projecting corner has been placed a stone somewhat like a bee-hive,* having a Buddha carved on each of its four faces, with a hole in the top for incense. The number of such now scattered over the country is almost inconceivable. The porch has always been small; and since it fell, some persons have cleared away the ruins and constructed a gate of the fragments. The shrine or cavity in the Mandir that is on a level with the ground, and the entrance to which was through the porch, is small, and covered with a Gothic arch, the plaster-work on which has been divided into small compartments, each containing an image of a Buddha. The whole far end of the chamber has been occupied by a throne of stone (singh\u00e1san) in a very bad taste, and which has been disfigured by a motley row of images taken from the ruins, and built on its front, so as to hide parts of the deity. This is a monstrous mis-shapen daub of clay, and has been well enough represented in a drawing published, if I recollect, by the late Col. Symes. The extreme rudeness of this image may, perhaps, be considered as a proof of great antiquity; and this may have been the original image placed here in the time of Gautama, round which the temple has been constructed. There is, however, current a tradition of the original image having been gold, and of its having been removed by the Muhammedans; so that the present image is supposed to have been made after the sect had undergone persecution, and could no longer procure workmen capable of making a decent substitute.\n\nAbove this chamber are two others, one on the level of the old terrace, and the other still higher; but with these the falling of the porch has cut off all communication. Several of the people, however, in the vicinity, remember the porch standing, and have frequently been in the chambers, a stair from the terrace leading to the uppermost. This was quite empty, and was probably the place where treasure was deposited. The middle\n\n* Deh.\nchamber has a throne, but the image has been removed; and if there ever was an image of gold, this was probably its place.\n\nThe terrace enlarges behind the temple, towards the west, and forms an area, on which is growing the pippal tree, which the orthodox suppose to have been planted by Brahm\u00e1. The worshippers of Gautama, on the contrary, assert that it is placed exactly in the centre of this earth, and call it Bodhidruma. They say that it was planted by Dugdha-C\u00e1min\u00ed, king of Singhal-dw\u00edp (Ceylon), 2,225 years before A.D. 1811; that is, according to them, 125 years before the building of the temple. The tree is in full vigour, and cannot, in all probability, exceed a hundred years in age; but a similar one may have existed in the same place when the temple was entire. Around its root has been lately raised a circular elevation of brick and mortar in various concentric stages; and on one of these has been placed a confused multitude of images and carved fragments of stone, taken from the ruins. On the pedestal of one of these images, representing a man with a woman sitting on his knee, which is one of the most usual figures in the district, the messengers from Ava carved an account of their visit, of which a copy is given,* and which must render us cautious in admitting the inscriptions on the various images in this district to have any connexion with their worship or erection.\n\nThe number of images at Buddha G\u00e1ya is very great; and there is scarcely any one form of those that are scattered so numerously about the whole country, for eight or ten coss in all directions, which may not be found in its immediate neighbourhood belonging to the great temple. This also seems to me to have been the quarry, as it were, from which almost the whole of those, for eight or ten coss round, have been carried. Many which are now worshipped by the orthodox, and no doubt have a strong resemblance to, and many attributes of, the gods of the present Hindus, seem to me to have had the same origin. It is evident, indeed, that the people are totally careless in this respect, worshipping males by the names of females, and female images for male deities. Nay, some of the images which they worship are actually Buddhas in the most unequivocal forms; while on, or over the heads of others there are representations of these lawgivers, as testifying their superiority. Another mark, by which most of these images may be known to have belonged to the Buddhas, is\n\n* East-India Company's Museum, No. 109.\nthe enormous size and distention of the lobe of their ears, which is very general in the images of this district, and even prevails in many of such as have in other respects the most decided appearance of the idols now worshipped. Another mark still, by which the convert asserts that all images formed by this sect may be distinguished, is a mark on the palm of the hands and soles of the feet, which is supposed to resemble the lotus flower.\n\nIn the drawings* I have given representations of many of the most curious images remaining in the immediate vicinity of the old temple, and built into the walls, or deposited within the convent of the Sanny\u00e1s\u00eds, and all confessedly taken from the ruins.\n\nThe converted Sanny\u00e1si pretends, that during the present existence of the world, except those of the four munis or lawgivers, none of these images were ever worshipped by the followers of the Buddhas; and that all the others were intended as ornaments, or monuments to represent either the various inferior beings of power (D\u00e9vat\u00e1s) who are admitted to exist by his sect as well as by the orthodox, or various persons whom their own vanity, or the affection of their own relations or disciples, wished to commemorate. This, I know, is the doctrine now entertained in Ava by the followers of Gautama, and which would, of course, be taught to him by the messengers through whom he was converted: but I have great doubt how far it is applicable to the followers of the Buddhas who formerly existed in this country. In N\u00e9p\u00e1l I know that the Buddhists worship all the D\u00e9vat\u00e1s, and especially Siva and the destructive female power; and I think it probable, that the Buddhists here did the same. The number of lingas, single, in rows, or in clusters, simple and adorned with human faces, crocodile heads, &c. is fully equal to that of the munis, both at Buddha G\u00e1ya and Bar\u00e1g\u00e1ng; and some of the images of the destructive female power are so remarkable and large, that I think they must have been intended as objects of worship. There can be no doubt, however, that by far the greater part of the host of images in the more decorated temples of the Hindus of all sects, is merely ornamental; and I think it probable, that most of the images of the Buddhas have been intended to represent the great multitude of such personages as have in former revolutions of the world obtained everlasting bliss, and were never in-\n\n* East-India Company's Museum, No. 78 to 101.\ntended to be worshipped, nor even reverenced. In the whole number, the messengers of Ava pointed out only four images, which they considered as representing the four munis or lawgivers who had appeared in this world, and which they knew by various annexed emblems. In the account of the embassy to Ava has been given a drawing of Mahamuni, who was worshipped in the great Mandir.\n\nI directed drawings to be taken of the other three, which have been removed into the convent of the Samnyasins, to protect them from injury; but one only, which represents Gautama,* was executed. The painters neglected to draw Chandra muni and Sakyamuni, which, they said, exactly resembled each other and an image previously drawn: but this, probably, is a mistake. The image, which they had previously drawn, may, indeed, have had a strong resemblance to both, and may be the same with one of them; but the other must be distinguished by some emblem that escaped their notice. The images representing the Buddhas, whether lawgivers of this world or not, are easily known by a simple robe, a natural human shape, placid countenance, curled hair, and long ears. Although the image above-mentioned is said to represent Gautama, there is nothing in the inscription to ascertain that it was intended for an object of worship. It would appear from the tenor that Jaya-sen and Kumara-sen, sons of Punyabhadra, son of Sambhata (all untitled persons), erected the image as a monument of their father's holiness. Another image,\u2020 according to the inscription on it, was erected by a Rajah Vijayabhadra, of whom nothing more is known.\n\n* East-India Company's Museum, No. 78. \u2020 Ibid. No. 79.\nIII. Observations respecting the Small-Pox and Inoculation in Eastern Countries; with some Account of the Introduction of Vaccination into India. By Whitelaw Ainslie, M.D., M.R.A.S.\n\nRead June 16, 1827.\n\nThere was a time, when to treat of the small-pox must have been a task truly painful; when, alas! little more could be done than to trace its devastations and its horrors: but, thanks to heaven and the perseverance of the benevolent, those days are long past, and the subject can at length be viewed in a very different light. Relieved from the distressing office of but too frequently having to offer a vain consolation to a virtuous mother sorrowing for the loss of a darling child, medical men can now speak of the disease with far other feelings; with the same satisfaction, to use a metaphor, that is felt in painting the blessings of an honourable peace, which have succeeded to a long and disastrous war; or the joy of a private family, which has finally risen into comfort and security, through a protracted struggle of domestic affliction.\n\nMuch difference of opinion has existed with regard to the period when the small-pox, or as it has lately been scientifically named, the emphyesis variola, made its first appearance in the world; and some authors have believed that this disorder, as well as the measles, with which it was in early ages confounded, were coeval with the human race. We certainly have no proof that either the Greeks or Romans were acquainted with it: at least no account is to be found in any of their works which perfectly agrees with its pathognomonic signs,* minutely examined as those works have been, for the purpose of such discovery, by several of our most distinguished writers.\u2020 That it raged in China long before it was observed in Europe, is\n\n* It would seem, however, that both Salmasius, and after him Johannes Hahn, a Dutch writer, had entertained a different opinion, and supposed that the disease had been described under another name (anthrax) by Hippocrates, and noticed by Celsus, Galen, and \u00c6tius: a supposition so absurd, that it cannot for a moment be listened to.\n\n\u2020 See Mead's medical works, vol. i. p. 229; also Willan on the Diseases of the Skin, vol. i. pp. 251-252.\na fact no longer doubted. Every one conversant with the history of the variola must have heard of a Chinese treatise on it, entitled Taou-tchin-fa, in which it is stated, that it did not show itself in that part of the world sooner than the year 1122 before Christ; and Father d'Entrecolles, a Jesuit, mentions having seen a work in which it is described as a malady of the earliest ages.* Many maintain that India gave birth to this hydra: and it has, unquestionably, been a dreadful scourge in that country from the most remote antiquity; a truth of which the reader may easily be assured by turning to Sonnerat, 'Voyages aux Indes Orientales,'\u2020 and also to a curious account of inoculating for the small-pox in the East-Indies, by J. Z. Holwell, published in 1767.\n\nRather varying information has been given of the goddess who is supposed by the Hindus to preside over this plague on the continent of India, and on Ceylon. By the s\u0101stra which Sonnerat consulted, it appears that Mariatal\u00e9 (Mariyatdli), the wife of Chamadaguini (Jamadagni), and mother of Parapourama (Parasu-r\u00e1ma), was the divine being in question, and that the power of healing this dreadful affection was bestowed upon her by the deities named D\u00e9velkers. Temples are dedicated to her, and festivals celebrated in her honour; some of the ceremonies of which are of a nature so cruel\u2021 as to be highly reprobated by even the Brahmins themselves. In some tracts of southern India she is supplicated, worshipped, and her wrath deprecated, under the name of Mariammu; in others lying farther north, under that of Sital\u00e1:\u00a7 hence the Hindustani appellation of \u0628\u0631\u064a \u0633\u064a\u0644\u0627 bari sitl\u00e1, by which the small-pox is well known to the Mahometans.\n\nPhilip Baldaeus has said, in his work entitled \"A true and exact Description of the East-Indies,\" published in 1664, that in Ceylon the small-pox goddess is called Patagr\u00e1li. He has given us a print of her, as having a tremendous form, with eight faces and sixteen arms; and asserts that she was the daughter of a god called Ixora (I'swara). Be all this as it may, certain it is, as already advanced, that the evil in question has been felt and dreaded,\n\n* See Moore's excellent History of the Small-Pox, p. 23. \u2020 Tom. i. p. 244.\n\u2021 At one of those ceremonies a man is suspended in the air by means of a cord run through the fleshy part of his loins. In this way he is whirled round at the extremity of a long pole, and at a great height from the ground.\n\u00a7 This goddess is painted as a yellow woman sitting on a water-lily. Worship is offered at her shrine on the 7th, 8th, and 9th of the increasing moon; on the 10th the image is thrown into the water.\u2014See Ward's View of the History, Literature, and Religion of the Hindus, vol. i. p. 174.\nnot only in India, but in several of the adjacent territories,* from time im-\nmemorial; and it is but too true, that till the good effects of vaccination\nbegan to be there experienced, in no region of the earth were its ravages\nmore appalling. Not rarely did it happen, that whole villages were depo-\npulated: the distemper, besides, but too often assumed its most malignant\nform (variola pustulis numerosis confluentibus), which, amongst the natives,\nproved so generally mortal, that the relations of the poor sufferers, on dis-\ncovering its putrid nature, not unfrequently cut asunder the ties of human\naffection, and deserted them altogether, moving off to a different part of the\ncountry, or to the opposite and windward side of a town, with such of the\nfamily as either had the disease of a milder kind (variola pustulis paucis\ndiscretis), or had hitherto escaped the contagion.\n\nHillary\u2020 speaks of the small-pox and measles as \"originally hatched and\n\" bred in, and properly indigenous to Arabia, probably in its most southern\n\" districts.\" Mead, on the other hand, thought it commenced its havoc in\nAfrica, and more especially in Ethiopia: a notion which appears to be con-\nfirmed by Dr. John Reiske, of Leyden, who being well versed in Arabic\nliterature, ascertained from certain relics, that about the year of our Lord\n572, the same in which Mahomet was born, Ethiopian traders carried the\nmalady for the first time into Arabia. Dr. Friend, however, was of an opposite\nopinion; and in his \"History of Medicine\" tells us, that he believes it was\nfirst brought into Egypt during the caliphat of Omar, about the year of\nChrist 640, by the Arabians, who had been infected by some Eastern or\nremote nation: and why not, we should add, according to the testimony of\nWebster,\u2021 by the Hindus? \"Ab Indi\u00e1 orientale in Egyptum, inde in Ara-\n\" biam, denique in Europam, variola pestis illa gravissima, commigrasse\n\" videtur.\" Although, by this quotation, the learned physician seems to\nhave thought that the small-pox had, on its way from the East, reached\nEgypt previously to its committing its ravages in Arabia; at all events,\nonce established there, we can readily conceive how quickly it must have\nbeen spread by the Saracen conquerors.\n\nBaron Dimsdale says: \"it is granted that the small-pox was imported from\n\" Asia by the crusaders, and did not shew itself in Europe before the thir-\n\n* See an account of an embassy to Thibet, by Captain Samuel Turner, in 1800, pp. 219-220.\n\u2020 See Woodville's History of the Small-Pox, vol. i. p. 2.\n\u2021 Vide Medecin. Prac. System. Carol. Webster, edit. tom i. p. 288.\n\"teenth century:\" a statement which we cannot reconcile with the facts, that both Constantius in Italy and Avenzoar in Spain, had noticed the evil as common in those dominions, in the eleventh century. Nay, we know that Mr. Moore, in his history* of the disease, gives us a curious account of the primary introduction of both it and the measles into Spain, by means of a Saracen invasion, occasioned by a rape committed by a king, and the consequent vengeance of a beautiful woman, as far back as the year 710. At what time Britain was first made to feel the effects of a disorder which other nations already lamented, it is impossible exactly to determine. We can only say with confidence, that by the earliest British medical writers, which were those of the thirteenth century,\u2020 the complaint is generally noticed. New Spain, according to Garcia,\u2021 was originally visited by it in 1520, when he declares it proved fatal to half the people of the provinces to which the infection extended. Then again we learn from Mr. Condamine, in his \"M\u00e9moire sur l'Inoculation,\" p. 61, that about fifty years after the discovery of Peru, this affection was carried over from Europe to America by the way of Carthagena. Now, as Peru was discovered by Pizarro\u00a7 in 1526, it would appear by this account, that the variola did not reach America before 1576, which but ill agrees with what has been stated by Garcia. In addition to all this I must here observe that, according to Robertson, Hispaniola|| suffered dreadfully from the small-pox in 1517: but as such discussion may be considered as a little foreign to my subject, referring as it does more immediately to Eastern countries, I briefly hint, before proceeding to further particulars, that the small-pox in a northern direction did not arrive at the frozen region of Greenland\u00b6 before the year 1733, when it nearly carried off the whole of the inhabitants.\n\nWhatever may be the varying sentiments regarding the era when the small-pox first shed its malignity on mankind, or its subsequent propagation, the same differences do not exist with respect to the writer who first\n\n---\n\n* See History of the Small-Pox, page 76.\n\u2020 Dr. Woodville, however, from an examination of many books in the British Museum, states that he has reason to think the small-pox was known in our island long before the Crusades began, in 1096.\n\u2021 Garcia, Origin, p. 88, cited by Robertson in his History of America, vol. iii, p. 400.\n\u00a7 See Robertson's History of America, book iii.\n|| Ibid. book iii.\n\u00b6 Grantz's History of Greenland, vol. i, p. 336.\npublished on the subject. Aaron of Alexandria, a distinguished author in the time of Mahomet, gave some account of the disease, according to the testimony of Rhazis,* who himself treats both of this and the measles, and who is, indeed, as Woodville justly allows, the principal amongst the old physicians in whose works, still extant, the attention of the world was called to the then reigning calamity. Aaron was a very voluminous writer, an adept in medicine as well as a priest of Alexandria, when that city was besieged by the Saracens, and was by every account highly esteemed in Arabia. It is a curious fact, that this learned man does not take the least notice of the contagious nature of the small-pox, but supposed it to proceed from an ebullition of the blood.\u2020 He it was, by all I can learn, who originally adopted the hypothesis of an adust blood and bile, of corrupt humours, and, what is interesting to know, of \"refrigerants which could retain pustules, and warm medicines which could expel them externally:\" realities which formed the basis of that method of treating the malady, by the free admission of cool air and other antiphlogistic means, first distinctly suggested by Sydenham,\u2021 afterwards improved by Boerhaave,\u00a7 and finally meliorated and established by Cullen in 1779. The next authors, in order of time, who wrote on the disorder, were Bachtishua and John the son of Mesue. The first was physician to the Caliph Almansor, in the eighth century; and, according to Rhazis,\u2016 maintained that the measles were occasioned by blood mixed with a large proportion of bile, and that the small-pox proceeded from an over gross and moist blood. The latter (John the son of Mesue) flourished towards the beginning of the ninth century; though, according to some, at a later period, he was a physician at the court of Haroun al Raschid, and renowned for his general learning as well as professional zeal.\n\nOf the labours of the Arabian writers just mentioned, but a few scattered fragments have escaped the ravages of time; but the works of Isaak the Israelite, remain. The exact time in which he lived cannot be distinctly ascertained; but, from the order in which Hali Abbas quotes him, it may have been in the ninth century. He would seem to have been an intelli-\n\n* Vide Rhazis de variolis et morbillis. Edit.

He lived and published towards the end of the ninth century; cites Mesue, who practised physic at Bagdad A.D. 795, and is himself referred to by Rhazis. This last-mentioned medical sage, for so he was reckoned, was named after a city of Khorassan, Rhei, in which he was born. He wrote, as already stated, professedly de variolis et morbillis, obtained great repute towards the beginning of the tenth century, and was the first who remarked that there were instances of the small-pox having occurred twice, and even thrice,* in the same person. Abulpharagius\u2020 speaks of him under the name of Muhammed Ebn Zacharia al Razi. Pocock makes him to have died in 980, and informs us that he was not only an able physician, but skilled in music, philosophy, and astronomy.\n\nIn the course of time came Hali Abbas, who was named by the Saracens Mhal\u00fbki, and was of the order of the magi. This distinguished Arabian wrote his famous Regalis Dispositio about the year 980: it is a general treatise on the healing art, dedicated to Caliph Eddoulat, and was translated from the Arabic into Latin by Stephanus, in 1492. Farther, however, than having made an approach to the discovery of the contagion, as the erudite Mr. Moore well calls it, Hali Abbas did little towards making mankind better acquainted with the true nature of the small-pox. He confounded it with the measles. He had some strange notions of the disorder being probably produced by the dregs of the milk, the better portion of which had been taken away by the suckling child, and betrays in many parts of his work that he was a great borrower from Hippocrates.\n\nIt is not necessary for my present purpose, that I should enumerate all the ancient Eastern or other authors, who may have at different times treated of a complaint which continued in those days to spread terror and dismay. If the reader is curious on the subject, he may find much relevant and well-arranged information in a work which I have repeatedly alluded to, Mr. Moore's History of the Small-pox. Suffice it here to observe, that up to the fifteenth century, there appeared in succession the far-famed Avicenna, born at Bokhara in A.D. 992, who spoke decidedly of the con-\n\n* Vide Rhazis Contin. lib. xxiii. cap. 8. \u2020 Vide Abulphar Dyn. ed. Pocock, p. 191.\ntagiousness of both small-pox and measles* (the last disease, however, he looked upon as no other than what he calls a bilious small-pox); Avenzoar, who was a native of Seville and a cotemporary of Avicenna; Constantius, who lived towards the end of the eleventh century, and was born at Carthage: he was a medical practitioner of great note, having studied at Babylon as well as Bagdad; Averrhoes, a Spanish Moor, who wrote on Medicine in the twelfth century: he translated Aristotle, and published a work entitled Colliget; Albucasis, who gave to the world a book named Al Tarif, more in repute for some judicious surgical opinions than any thing new it contained: he also wrote in the twelfth century; Gilbert, who composed a compendium of medicine, and which is the oldest English medical tract now extant: Dr. Friend conjectured that he flourished about the end of the thirteenth century, in the reign of the first Edward, though we have no testimony that, on the subject of small-pox, he brought forward one original idea; after him came Gentili of Foligno, and Herculaneus, both of whose writings are involved in all the erroneous doctrines of Avicenna; and lastly, John of Gaddesden, who was author of the famous dissertation on medicine known by the appellation of the \"English Rose,\" and who, though he was principal physician to Edward II., has, in his chapter on small-pox and measles, omitted few of the mistakes of the Arabians.\n\nFrom the fifteenth up to the middle of the seventeenth century, the science of medicine continued gradually to improve. Many ridiculous theories, however, regarding the variolous disease were broached during that period; till, as we have seen, our distinguished countryman, Sydenham, dispelling those clouds which had long darkened the medical horizon, brought to light a new era in physic: nor was the brilliancy of his reputation, as has been well said by an able writer,\u2020 in any way obscured by his immediate successors, great as they were, Etmuller, Boerhaave, and Cullen.\n\nPerhaps no disease, to which the human frame is subject, has excited more laborious discussion than the small-pox; yet, after all, little of a positive nature has been ascertained respecting it, beyond the facts, that it is produced by a specific contagion, or a matter, as it has been called, sui generis; that it rarely happens that the same person is attacked twice by it; that it is distinguished into a mild and malignant sort; and lastly, that the Almighty\n\n* Vide Avicen. Canon, lib. iv. tom. 1. cap. 6. \u2020 Mr. Moore.\nhas, in his mercy, bestowed on mankind no less than two powerful weapons with which to combat it: these are Inoculation and Vaccination. How the small-pox could at first have originated sets all conjecture at defiance; and it must be difficult to account for this singularity regarding it, that although nothing but variolous matter, under some modification or other, has the effect of generating the disease,* yet it seems to be more prevalent at some seasons than at others; as if its appearance was consequent on a peculiar state of the air; an idea which has been held very cheap by the author just cited, as well as by others.\u2020\n\nMany physicians of note believe that the small-pox contagion is limited to a very narrow circle, and that it is rarely conveyed by the wind to a distance; and we know that Dr. Haygarth in his \"sketch of a plan to exterminate this malady from Great Britain,\" tells us that certain facts appear to exhibit negative proofs, that open air is not contaminated by it to a greater distance from the patient than one thousand five hundred feet, and probably not to one hundredth part of that space: how then did it happen, it may be asked, that for years together in India, previous to the practice of vaccination, the malady was not heard of in some districts; then, without a possibility of its being traced to any evident cause, did it come like a pestilence, spreading with rapid strides, and sparing neither sex nor age nor condition? So much was the calamity dreaded, that religious ceremonies were, and I presume still are, performed annually in every village to depreciate the scourge; humble supplications were made by people of all ranks at the shrine of the small-pox goddess; and prayers offered up, calling on her to take under her care such as might be suffering from, or had not yet been visited by, the terrible affliction.\n\nThe mild disorder variola discreta is called in Tamul Peri ammay, in Telinga, Pedamma; in Pali, Kruivan; in Sanscrit Masirik\u00e1; and in Dukhanie, Bari-sitl\u00e1: it may be found treated of in various Tamul sastras, common in Lower India; but more especially in that named Vaittiya Vaghadam Airit Any\u00faru, a medical work by Agastya. The same complaint is termed by the modern Arabians, Ableh also Aljuderi; and by the Malays, Cachar \u062a\u0627\u062c\u0627\u0631; a well written treatise on it in Arabic is entitled \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0623\u062c\u062f\u0631\u064a \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0645\u0628\u0647, and was composed by Abu Jafar Ahmed bin Muhammed. In a Sanscrit book common in Ceylon and written in the Singalese cha-\n\n* See Woodville's History of the Small-pox, p. 3. \u2020 See Dr. Wilson on febrile diseases.\nracter, entitled Madhava Nidhana, consisting of 1,375 verses, the small-pox is fully described. To the confluent form the Tamuls have given the appellation of Panisheri ammai, and both this and the simple affection assume nearly the same appearances in India that they do in colder countries; with this difference, that in the hot climate, owing, it may be presumed, to the stimulus of heat, the distemper is evidently a little accelerated in all its stages. It is a singular fact that the small-pox most frequently shews itself in the East in the cold season; that is, on the Coromandel coast, from the end of November to the middle of February; and I have also observed that, in general, at that period, it is more apt to be severe than in the warm and dry weather. For this last peculiarity it might be difficult to assign a cause, unless we are allowed to suppose that those who have the disease suffer more from being, in the cold months, closely pent up in their small huts (which, owing to their clay floors, mud walls, and straw roofs, must be extremely damp*), instead of being allowed to lie in open verandas, as they had been in the hot season, where they enjoyed at least a free circulation of air, and were at the same time screened from the mid-day heat.\n\nBy Dr. Hillary's\u2020 account of the small-pox in Barbadoes, however, it would seem to have appeared there generally in the months of March, April, and May, which constitute in that island the warm and dry season of the year. It is strange that Moseley, who wrote professedly on the disorders of hot climates, should not mention the malady; nor does Dr. Hunter, in his \"Diseases of Jamaica,\" take the least notice of it; though I perceive that it has found a place in a little work entitled \"Letters and Essays on some of the West-India Complaints,\" by Mr. Quier,\u2021 in which he informs us that the small-pox began to shew itself a little before Christmas in 1767; at first mildly, but as the season advanced it grew frequently fatal, and as summer came on it was often of the worst kind. In Minorca, which though not a tropical, is a hot country, Cleghorn\u00a7 tells us that the disease was epidemic in 1742 and 1746. When it first appeared in 1742, the inhabitants were astonished, as they had not seen the disorder for the last seventeen years,\n\n---\n\n* To the great dampness of Cork, owing to its situation and other causes, Dr. Walker ascribes the severity of the small-pox in that city.

In fact, as far as I can learn, no part of the world, with the exception, perhaps, of some of the smaller lately discovered islands, is now altogether exempt from the evil. In Ceylon* it was often of the worst kind; in Java (where it is termed ketumbaun), in Sumatra, and in China,\u2020 it was terrible; nor was it less so in the Malayan Peninsula and in all the different Eastern islands. At Banda and Amboina it had been observed to shew itself once in six or seven years; but, alas! the visits, \"though far between,\" were generally most baneful in their consequences.\n\nInoculation for the small-pox, I should suppose, must have been known and practised, in some provinces of Asia, at a more remote period\u2021 than we can by any authentic records ascertain; nor is it a matter of great consequence, to obtain any very minute information as to the time. I think it probable that this method of rendering the complaint milder may have been had recourse to in different countries, without any communication whatever having taken place betwixt them on the subject; and, in all likelihood, was discovered in each by observing the consequences arising from chance contact, when the pustules were broken: in the same way that the cow-pox was first noticed by milk-maids, or those employed in handling the cows. Many conjectures have been given to the world: Mr. Maty was of opinion, that the regions lying betwixt the Caspian and Euxine seas were the centre from which inoculation spread: for this supposition, however, Dr. Woodville\u00a7 thinks there are no satisfactory grounds. D'Entrecolles has remarked, that the Tartars were entirely ignorant of it in 1724: and the same author has observed, that in the province of Kean-nan, and in the other eastern parts of China, it is more frequently resorted to than in the western. Whether China or India has the prior claim to the discovery of inoculation, is a point still undetermined. Some Jesuits scruple not to say, that it was from the former transmitted equally to India and to Europe. Again, we learn from Chais's \"Essai Apolog\u00e9tique sur la M\u00e9thode de communiquer la Petite-verolle par Inoculation,\" as well as from other authorities, that it was practised in\n\n---\n\n* See the Rev.

Ward's View of the History, Religion, and Literature of the Hindoos, vol. iv. p. 339.\n\u00a7 See his History of Inoculation, vol. i. p. 36.\nin Hindustan from the most remote antiquity. Condamine, while at Naples in 1769, was told that inoculation had been common there from time immemorial; and Dr. Russell* has stated, that the Turkman tribes had been in the habit of inoculating for ages past. Nay, something very like this is also expressed by Niebuhr, with regard to the adoption of it amongst the Arabians.\u2020 Of the exact epoch at which this method of mitigating the distemper first attracted notice in England, we have sufficient testimony; it originated in a communication made by Dr. Emanuel Timoni, a Greek, who had studied at Oxford and Padua, to his friend Dr. Woodward, from Constantinople\u2021 in 1718, in consequence of having witnessed the good effects of it in that city; which communication was afterwards published, in 1714, in the Philosophical Transactions: and it is as well known, that Lady Wortley Montague's daughter was inoculated in London with success in 1722, by Mr. Maitland, who had performed the same operation on her son, a short time before, at Constantinople, and who lost no time in disseminating the blessing throughout the British dominions. In South Wales, however, and in the Highlands,\u00a7 inoculation is considered by some to have been practised by the old women at a period antecedent to its introduction from the East: and I do not think it at all improbable, countenanced as the assumption is by a letter from Dr. Wright to Mr. Bevan, which may be found in the Philosophical Transactions for 1722, and also by Dr. Monro's account of vaccination in Scotland.\n\nAlthough we cannot say that inoculation was ever very generally adopted in India by the natives, yet it is sufficiently well understood, that it is practised there, and in various modes, in different provinces. It is in the hands of a particular tribe of Brahmens; but who, though they are remunerated for their labours, are, I fear, often more mysterious than industrious in their avocation. Mr. Moore gives a full account of the method pursued in some of the northern tracts of Hindustan, as described, I think, by Mr. Holwell; and notices the necessary prayers that are recited during the ceremony of the operation, as appointed in the Atharva Veda to propitiate the small-pox\n\n---\n\n* See an account of inoculating in Arabia, in a letter from Dr. P.

The Rev. W. Ward* informs us, that inoculation is performed not by the regular doctors (vaidya), but by a lower order of Brahmens (Daivajnya), at any period of the year, but chiefly on the 7th, 8th, and 9th of the increase of the moon. This valuable writer also tells us (vol. iv. p. 339), that the variolous matter is introduced into the child's arm nearly in the same way that it is in Europe; but the place chosen is just above the wrist; in the right arm of the male, and the left of the female. I found, while in the Ganjam circar, that inoculation had been prevalent there when the European conquerors first got possession of it; and I have no doubt, from what I witnessed and have since heard, that it must have been customary in that district for many ages past. There is this peculiarity in the fact, that it is not amongst the Gentoos who inhabit the range of low and richly cultivated country along the sea shore that the salutary precaution is usually resorted to, but amongst men comparatively less civilized, who talk a barbarous dialect, have a dissenting form of religion, and who live in the more inland and hilly country. They are called Worriahs, and are distinguished by boldness, hardihood, and attachment to their respective rajas: a brave, handsome race, who cherish independence, and usually build their castles in the most inaccessible and woody recesses of their mountainous dominions; by which means they but too often have it in their power to give infinite trouble to our regular troops, in times of disaffection and revolt. Here, as in Upper India, it is by a class of Brahmens that inoculation is practised; they assume an exclusive right to it, and from the circumstance of their being priests and physicians combined, they can not only exercise their healing skill, but by their pretended immediate intercourse with the goddess who presides over the disease, can either petition for a mild affection, or in cases of danger, supplicate for the safety of the patient; seldom failing, on such occasions, to carry the little sufferer to the image of the goddess, before which it is bathed with the same water that had been offered at the shrine. The Worriah word for small-pox is Tikar\u0101ni: to inoculation they have given the name of Tikar, and the inoculators are called Tikar Brahmens. A dose or two of some opening medicine is, for the most part, given previously to the operation being performed; and great care is taken that the child has no eruption on the skin. The infection is conveyed by means of\n\n* See his View of the History, Literature, and Religion of the Hindus, vol. i. p. 174.\na sharp instrument, which is first inserted dry under the cuticle, and after having been moistened at the point with the variolous matter, is inserted in the same incision, and there kept for a short time. The part commonly chosen for the reception of the virus is on the outer and upper part of the wrist. Both arms are inoculated at once; and immediately after the office is performed they are slightly bound up, the patient being also ordered to take a little of the virus internally, mixed up with rice in the form of a pill. From this period till the fever comes on, he is ordered to be bathed twice or thrice daily in cold water, is cautiously kept from the sun\u2019s rays, and when the pustules are ripe they are all opened with a needle. With the exception of a little unrefined sugar (j\u00e1gari), nothing in the way of medicine is given; and this is administered rather as it makes also a part of the offering to the goddess, than from any notion of its virtues.\n\nIn the pure habits of the Hindus it may easily be imagined that the inoculated small-pox is almost constantly benign; and this mildness, together with the simplicity of the operation, added no doubt to the powerful influence of custom for centuries, made the inhabitants of India not a little reluctant to the introduction of vaccination. At all times blindly devoted to their ancient modes, interwoven as they are with their religious doctrines, beyond perhaps any people on earth, they are strongly averse to whatever innovations might lead them to forsake the usages of their ancestors; and why they should give a preference to a new method of combating the disorder, which they felt had already been rendered sufficiently innocent, they neither could comprehend nor wished to have explained to them.\n\nPreviously to the introduction of vaccination into India, inoculation for the small-pox was almost invariably attended with the happiest effects amongst the European inhabitants. The time of life selected for receiving the disease was generally after the child had cut all its first teeth; and the season of the year, that which ensues after the rains are over. But, with all its advantages, inoculation must still be allowed, for many obvious reasons, to be far inferior to the recent and more extraordinary discovery of vaccination, for most of what is practically valuable in which the world stands indebted to the observations and patient investigation of Dr. Jenner, who, prompted by the best feelings of humanity, and supported by the spirit of ingenious research, most happily established one of the greatest blessings that was ever bestowed on man.\nWith regard to the origin of the Jennerian disease, for so it ought perhaps to be called, there has been not a little discussion. The Illyauts of Persia say it is found upon their milch sheep. Dr. Jenner himself, in his tract above cited, has traced it from the heels of the horse* to the nipple of the cow, and from that to the hands of the dairy-maid. This notion met with considerable opposition; and many experiments were in consequence made to ascertain whether the cow-pox could or could not be produced by the matter of grease applied to the udder of the cow. Woodville, Coleman, and others, attempted to bring the regular malady into action in this way, and failed; though it would appear that subsequent experiments by Dr. Loy were attended with an opposite result; and, from the facts\u2020 adduced by this last-mentioned gentleman, we are led to conclude that Dr. Jenner was correct in his opinion; and that a person who has been infected with the disorder from a horse's heels, becomes equally unsusceptible of the small-pox contagion as if he had had the common vaccine disease. From Dr. Loy's conclusion we are induced to believe, that there are two kinds of grease to which the horse is subject; one merely local, the other attended with constitutional and febrile symptoms;\u2021 and that it is from the eruption which accompanies the latter, only, that the fluid can be obtained which produces the genuine cow-pox vesicle: and, in this way, some late writers have accounted for the non-success of Dr. Woodville and others, who may not have made choice of the proper disorder in the horse. Further investigation might have been made, to put the point in question for ever at rest: though, after all, it is perhaps of little consequence. To have found the cow-pox producing fluid in the purest of all animals (the cow), ought surely to be sufficient guarantee for our most confident repose.\n\nThe discovery of vaccine inoculation in England naturally excited great interest and curiosity amongst the inhabitants of other territories, and whilst they admired and adopted it, they were not a little anxious to obtain, if possible, the wonderful preservative, from the cows of their respective countries. Dr. Lewis Sacco of Milan, in his treatise on the cow-pox, informs us that the cows of Lombardy are subject to this affection, and that it is contagious in the herd. C. Favo, vaccine inoculation director, addressed a\n\n---\n\n* See Dr. Jenner's Inquiry into the Causes and Effects of the Variol\u00e6 Vaccin\u00e6, p. 6.\n\u2020 Loy's Account of some Experiments on the Origin of the Cow-Pox, p. 20.\n\u2021 See Annals of Medicine, vol. ii., p. 263.\nletter to Dr. Woodville, from Milan, dated 7th of November 1801, in which he observed that he was the first person in Italy who found that the cow-pox prevailed amongst the cows of that part of the world. In America,* after much industrious research, this singular vesicle was discovered by Dr. William Buel of Sheffield, in the state of Massachusetts, on the cows of that place, about the middle of May 1801; it was also found in the state of Connecticut, by Dr. Elisha North of Goshen, as well as by Dr. J. Trowbridge of Danbery; and there is no doubt, that it has been met with in several other of the American provinces. I should rejoice if I could here add, that we had been equally fortunate in India; but, alas! in no part of those vast dominions, as far as I can learn, is the vaccine disease at present to be found on the cows; neither has the exact affection of the horses' heels, which has obtained the name of grease, been seen. It is more than probable, however, that on the cows of the adjoining country of Butan\u2020 the complaint might be discovered, were it diligently sought after: as that is a land, notwithstanding its low latitude (from $26^\\circ 30'$ to $28^\\circ 50'$ north) in which are found many of the productions of Europe, owing to its great elevation above the level of the sea. It must be remarked, that I have said that the vaccine disease cannot at present be found on the cows of India. This expression I have used, as there are some grounds for believing that inoculation for the cow-pox was known in days of old to the Hindu medical writers. From a communication written by Calvi Virambam, a learned Hindu, and which appeared in the Madras Courier of the 12th January 1819, I make the following extract. \"To substantiate the fact that the inoculation of the cow-pox was known in remote times to the Vaidyas, it is only necessary to refer to the Sacteya Grantha, attributed to Dhanwantari, and therefore undoubtedly an ancient composition. In one part of the work, after describing nine several kinds of small-pox, of which three (one alabi, being the confluent) are declared incurable, the author proceeds to lay down the rules for the practice of inoculation. From this part the following two excerpts are made; of the first of which the original is given in the English character, and with it a literal translation: of the second the original is not given, but merely the translation.\"\n\n* See Medical Repository, vol. v. p. 93.\n\u2020 Extending from Chichacottah to Phari.

The book, however, from which the\nquotation is said to have been made by Calvi Virambam, is well known in\nLower India, and might easily be examined. I have myself many doubts;\nand it is certainly a presumption against it, that the disease is no longer\nto be found on the cows of that country. For the absolute existence\nof the cow-pox on the cattle of Persia, I am happy to say there are\nsomewhat more immediate and substantial proofs, as shown by a letter\nwritten by W. Bruce, Esq., resident at Bushire, to W. Erskine, Esq., of Bombay, which appeared in the Asiatic Journal for June 1819; and to which my attention has been called by my friend, Dr. B. G. Babington, late of Madras.\n\nExtract from the above-mentioned Letter.\n\n\"When I was in Bombay, I mentioned to you that the cow-pox was well-known in Persia by the Illyauts, or wandering tribes. Since my return here (Bushire), I have made very particular inquiries on that subject, amongst several tribes who visit this place in the winter, to sell the produce of their flocks, such as carpets, rugs, butter, cheese, &c. Their flocks, during this time, are spread over the low country to graze. Every Illyaut whom I have spoken to on this head, of at least six or seven different tribes, has uniformly told me, that the people who are employed to milk the cattle caught a disease, which having once had they were afterwards perfectly safe from the small-pox; that this disorder was prevalent amongst the cows, and shewed itself particularly on the teats; but that it was still more common among, and more frequently caught from, the sheep. Now this is a circumstance that has never, I believe, before been known, and of the truth of which I have not the smallest doubt. To be sure on the subject, I made more particular inquiry of a very respectable farmer who resides in my neighbourhood, named Malilla (and whom Mr. Stephen Babington knows well). This man confirmed every word that the Illyauts had said, and that his own sheep had it. There may be one reason for the Illyauts saying that they caught the malady oftener from the sheep than the cows; which is, that most of their butter, ghee, and cheese, is made from sheeps' milk: their black cattle yield very little, being more used for draught than anything else.\"\n\nWhatever may have been done formerly in India, vaccination, as it is now there practised, was first introduced into that country through the zealous exertions of European foreign physicians; a description of men whose humanity and philanthropy, thanks to heaven, flourished in spite of all the restrictions of the French revolution. The cow-pock fluid was taken from cows in Lombardy by Dr. Sacco, and despatched by D. de Carro from Vienna to Bagdad, from which place it went by different stages to Bussora and Bombay. The infected threads sent to the last-mentioned place failed; but others, transmitted to Trincomallee, produced the vaccine disease there\nin August 1802.* Little time was lost in disseminating the affection over Ceylon; and it was from that island that the first active virus was conveyed, by the ship Hunter, to Madras, where the boon was neither coldly received nor languidly circulated; and if the Indian world now enjoys in an eminent degree the benefit of Dr. Jenner's labours, it must be confessed that it was in a great measure owing to the judicious steps taken by Earl Powis, then Lord Clive, who was at all times watchful how he could best promote the real interests of the country which he governed. On this occasion his Lordship was very ably aided by the exertions of Dr. James Anderson, at that time physician general, and whose immediate charge the new arrival consequently became; this gentleman, with all that cheerful and active benevolence which ever distinguished him, and rendered his long life one continued study how to avert the calamities, and alleviate the sufferings, which are incident to mankind, lost not a moment in adopting the wisest method, not only for preserving the valuable stranger in perfect purity, but for rendering every corner of our Asiatic dominions a partaker of the gift. Nor did he rest satisfied here; but with admirable foresight, transmitted the vaccine virus to every distant and eastern kingdom or province within the range of his extensive correspondence. In the first establishing of vaccination at Madras, Dr. Anderson permitted no man to sleep at his post, fully aware of the inestimable value of the newly-discovered preventive, as well as the difficulty with which it had been brought to so remote a land. Government, at that time occupied with serious political affairs, were reminded by him how necessary it was that superintendents and subordinate vaccinators should be instantly appointed in different districts, to keep alive and spread the welcome present which they had just received; and that, as in the introduction of all that is novel in India, much reluctance might naturally be expected, he pointed out in what manner exhortatory proclamations should be made, and how pecuniary rewards and encouragement could with the greatest advantage be bestowed on those who proved most successful in prevailing on the natives to adopt the cow-pox inoculation. In a word, I hesitate not to say, that had it not been for the example and assiduity of this enlightened and amiable man, cordially assisted and encouraged as he was by the supreme authority, the variol\u00e6 vaccin\u00e6 would in all probability have long before this\n\n* See Cordiner's Ceylon, vol. i. p. 255.\nexpired, amidst the hot winds, indolence, or other local obstacles peculiar to the regions of the torrid zone.\n\nVaccination, notwithstanding its many enemies* at one time in England, and the numerous real or pretended cases that have been brought forward against it, still preserves its original good name in India, pure as the breath of the animal from which it springs! Nor can I find, that when care has been taken to select the true disease with a perfectly transparent fluid; to take that fluid from the vesicle at the proper time\u2020 (not later than the seventh or eighth day); to avoid vaccinating persons who may have any breaking-out\u2021 of whatever nature, on the skin; and by having invariably recourse to Mr. Bryce's test:\u00a7 when those points have been attended to, I repeat, I cannot find that vaccination has ever in that country, in any one instance, disappointed the hopes of the practitioner, or a mother's fondest wish. It is true, that, when the new disease was first brought to the Coromandel coast, there were a few blunders committed by inexperienced men, who mistook for the real malady some of those pustules which frequently appear on children in hot climates, and were astonished that they could not produce from them a disorder similar to what they had seen pictured in books or heard described; or, perhaps, they had trusted to the appearance of irregular vesicles,|| and hastily deemed them sufficient. But mistakes of this nature were soon rectified; and for many years past no doubts have been entertained, either as to the exact facies of the true complaint, or as to the non-existence of those evils which it was said occasionally to leave\n\n---\n\n* There are those who suppose that the preventive influence of the cow-pox fluid may perhaps only operate on the frame for a certain period or number of years, an evil which, if it does exist, might be obviated by repeating the operation of vaccination from time to time.\n\n\u2020 By not attending to this caution, mischief is sometimes done by the production of a spurious disease; a fact clearly proved by Dr. Friese, of Breslaw.

Trans., vol. xiv. pages 233, &c.\n\n\u2021 An inestimable caution given us by Jenner.\n\n\u00a7 Which is, to vaccinate one arm from the other; when it will be found, that if the first operation has been effectual in bringing on the real constitutional disease, the second attempt will fail in producing the regular vesicle.\u2014See Bryce on the Cow-Pox, page 207.\n\n|| Dr. Willan describes three species of vesicles which have at times been mistaken for cow-pox, but which do not wholly secure the constitution from small-pox.\u2014See his work on Vaccine Inoculation, page 39. A degenerated cow-pox was also noticed by Sir Gilbert Blane; in it the vesicle is amorphous, the fluid often of a straw-colour or purulent, and the areola absent, indistinct, or confused.\u2014See his examination before the House of Commons.\nbehind. It has been affirmed, and I believe with truth, that the cow-pox virus is rendered milder* by passing through the human frame; but this is what I could never put to the proof in India, from not being able to find the vesicle on the cattle: a fact which must lead to the caution of taking the virus from time to time from the cow, in order to preserve, as much as possible, its peculiar quality.\n\nThe small-pox supervening to regular vaccination has been called the modified disease,\u2020 and would appear to put on somewhat different appearances, owing to causes which it is not necessary here to enumerate. During my residence in India, after the introduction of the variola vaccinae into that country, which was not more than twelve years, I never heard of a single death occasioned by vaccination, nor by small-pox coming on after it; nor do I think that, in the same period of time, I witnessed more than four well-marked cases of the modified disease. In three of these, the fever previous to the eruption was very slight, in the fourth it was more severe; but in all it disappeared, or nearly so, on the coming out of the eruption; that is to say, on the second or third day. The pustules, which did not in any of the cases amount to more than one hundred, were generally small, and contained a milk-like rather than a purulent fluid; and, in place of continuing to the eleventh or twelfth day before bursting, they dried and became light brown crusts on the fourth day; and there was this peculiarity in every instance, and I am not aware that it has been ever noticed in Europe, that there was a total want of that strong, singular, and rather loathsome smell, which constantly attends the common small-pox when the pustules are mature.\n\nAnother modified eruptive malady, which I have oftener than once met with in India, I can consider in no other light than as the hives (emphyesis globularis) changed in its nature by vaccination, as the affection has nearly all the distinguishing symptoms of that disorder, as described by Dr. Heberden,\u2021 but in a milder degree. In the modified complaint I could never perceive any feverish symptoms whatever, with the exception of a little restlessness in the child. About the second day, the pustules (if pustules\n\n* See Dr. Mason Good's Study of Medicine, vol. ii. page 596.\n\u2020 For an excellent account of a varioloid epidemic which lately prevailed in Edinburgh and other parts of Scotland, with observations on the identity of Chicken-pox and modified Small-pox, see a work on the subject by Dr. John Thomson.\n\u2021 See Medical Transactions, vol. i. article xxii.\nthey can be properly called, which contain a watery fluid) felt hardish under\nthe finger, as if made of horn, and on the fourth day dried up; so differing\nfrom the regular hives of India as well as Europe, in which the eruption is\nknown to appear on the fourth day with little abatement of the fever.\n\nThis notion of a modified hives (emphyesis globularis) in India may\nappear questionable, when it is taken into consideration that none of the\nvarieties of water or chicken-pock (emphyesis varicella) have ever yet been\ngiven by inoculation: a fact ascertained by the distinguished author just\nquoted. Yet I am not aware to what other cause than previous vaccina-\ntion could be ascribed the peculiar mildness of a disease (hives), well known\nto be in its natural character, sufficiently inflammatory; an affection\nwhich, though it cannot be excited by inoculation, is known to attack peo-\nple but once in the course of their lives.\n\nWhen I first adopted vaccination in the Carnatic, I found that even with\nthe best virus, I often failed in producing the disease; till it struck me that\nif, previous to inserting the fluid, the arm was to be gently rubbed with a\npiece of dry flannel, so as to induce a slight degree of warmth, it might ren-\nder the absorption more certain. This method I put in practice, and with\nsuccess.\n\nConsidering that the vaccine vesicle cannot be, or has not yet been,\nfound on the cows or sheep in India, the greatest care becomes necessary\nin that country to keep it up in proper purity in the human race; it may\nnot, therefore, be of slight importance to be generally known, that it was\ndiscovered by the late much lamented Mr. Bryce of Edinburgh, that the\ncrusts properly preserved from the air in a closely shut phial, preserve\ntheir active virtue for a great length of time, and may thus be transmitted\nto the most distant countries, and there produce the disease.\n\nIn propagating vaccination in our Eastern dominions, a good deal had\nbeen done previously to my leaving Madras in 1815; yet it is evident\nthat still greater things might have been accomplished, had it not been for\nthe perverse prejudices of the Hindus, which, however, I am happy to learn,\nare gradually giving way, as they become more and more satisfied of the\nvalue of the discovery. Annual reports of the progress in overcoming\nthose obstacles were regularly made, in my time, to Dr. Jenner, by the dif-\nferent superintendents of vaccination of the three establishments; and, in\nfact, many praiseworthy measures taken, to aid that distinguished individual\nin completely establishing the virtues of this extraordinary preservative.\nBy an account published at Madras by Mr. A. Mackenzie, it would appear that, from the 1st September 1806 to the 1st September 1807, there had been vaccinated at the presidency of Fort St. George and the subordinate vaccine stations subject to that authority, 243,175 persons of different sexes, castes, and ages. Mr. Haughton, assistant surgeon of the coast artillery, who returned from China in May 1809, informed me that he found the cow-pox in high repute at Macao, under the zealous direction of Mr. A. Pearson, surgeon of the Honourable Company's factory at Canton who had written a short treatise on it, which had been admirably translated into Chinese by Sir George Staunton. By an official report communicated by Dr. Christie, superintendent of vaccination in Ceylon, I perceive that in that island, during the year 1808, no less than 26,207 individuals had undergone the operation and had the genuine disorder; which made, in all, vaccinated under that gentleman's care, since the introduction of it at Trincomallie in 1802, up to 1808, 108,036 persons of all ages. Subsequent and much more recent information* from Eastern countries, from India, Persia,\u2020 Java, China, Sumatra, and Manilla, give the most pleasing assurances of the success which invariably attends the adoption of the Jennerian disease in those distant regions; where a casual case of small-pox appearing after it has, from its great mildness, long ceased to alarm, and where the constant security which it affords against that horrific monster, the variola in its malignant form, have at length happily convinced millions, that if, from a powerful empire in the west came an inordinate thirst for dominion and the sword of the conqueror, thence also came the sympathizing heart and the healing hand.\n\nEdinburgh, 20th December 1826.\n\n* Up to the years 1822 and 1823.\n\u2020 It would appear by Morier's second journey to Persia, that, about the year 1810, the king of that country actually caused ferashes to be placed, in order to prevent the women from taking their children to the surgeons to be vaccinated; and this was done at a time when, from the anxiety of the natives themselves to adopt the preventive, there was every reason to hope that it would become general in Tehran. In 1816, however, we learn by a communication from the English ambassador at Ispahan, that the presumptive heir to the throne and fifteen of his suite had been vaccinated, and that the blessing was making rapid strides throughout the Persian dominions.\u2014See Asiatic Journal for October 1816, and September 1818.\nIV.\u2014A Description of the Agricultural and Revenue Economy of the Village of Pudu-vayal, in that part of the Peninsula of India called the Carnatic.\n\nBy John Hodgson, Esq., M.R.A.S.\n\nRead June 16, 1827.\n\nIn submitting these notices to the attention of the Society, the object is to bring under its view the internal revenue economy of a Hindu village that has never been under the direct control of any European officer of the East-India Company, in order to exhibit a fair specimen of ancient usages in the south of India, and to shew with accuracy, the proportion of the produce of the soil customarily taken in kind, in latter times, as land revenue, the rights of the parties paying revenue, and those of the individual who, by grant from the sovereign, is entitled to collect that revenue.\n\nThese notices contain little that is new on the rights of the peasantry of the south-eastern part of the peninsula of India. The public records of the government of Madras from an early period, the report of the case tried in the Supreme Court at Madras in 1808, preserved in Sir Thomas Strange\u2019s notes, and the memoir prepared by the late Mr. F. W. Ellis, of the Madras civil service, all contain much interesting information on the landed tenures of the south of India. In this paper, therefore, I have merely endeavoured to render the subject intelligible to those who have not been in India, by divesting the description of all technical terms.\n\nThe village of Pudu-Vayal is situated about thirty miles north-west of Madras, in that portion of the Carnatic denominated the Company\u2019s Jagir. The village has defined boundaries. The lands, like those of some parishes in England, and in other parts of Europe, are held and cultivated in common, by the privileged members of the community. The other divisions of territory in India are of various denominations, according as Hindu or\nMuhammedan terms are used to express them. The boundaries of all subdivisions of territory, including more than one village, are defined by the limits of the villages included in such subdivisions: they have not any boundaries of their own. The grant of a province including many villages would therefore be defined by a list of those enumerated in the grant.* The boundaries are supposed to have been fixed when the villages were first settled (or, as the natives express it, when the village was born), and they frequently contain large tracts of uncultivated land, and even of land overgrown with brushwood or forest-trees, called jungle.\n\nThe village in question was made over by grant, in the year 1784, to a servant of Sir Eyre Coote. The conditions of the grant were, that he should collect the revenue payable to the sovereign according to the custom of the village; that he should pay to the sovereign (the East-India Company) out of that revenue, a reserved sum annually amounting to three hundred pagodas, or about \u00a3120; that he should retain for his benefit the difference between \u00a3120 and the annual revenue he might by custom be entitled to receive from the cultivators of the soil. The grant neither specified the amount of the revenue which the grantee was entitled to collect, nor the rate at which he was to collect it. It gave him, by grant, the sovereign's rights; it left those rights to be ascertained by custom, and, in case of dispute respecting the rights of either party, left the question to be decided by such authorities as the sovereign had appointed.\n\nThe lands within the boundary of this village consist of two kinds: one of which is irrigated by means of the water of the monsoon rains, preserved during that season in a reservoir called a tank; the other is not capable of irrigation, but is rendered productive by rain as it casually falls. A tank, in the part of India to which this description refers, is composed of a bank of earth carried along the declivity of a plain, so as to collect and retain the water running from a higher level. The tank of this village is a small one, of which the bank is not more than three-eighths of a mile long.\n\nThe total extent of land within the boundaries of this village is c\u0101nis 548,\u2020 divided as follows:\n\n* In this manner the grant of a Jagir, in 1765, to the Company by the Nabob of the Carnatic, was a grant of villages, specified in a list or schedule attached to the grant.\n\u2020 A c\u0101ni is 57,600 square feet.\nLand capable of irrigation, called in revenue language 'wet land' ........................................ C\u00e1nis 211\\(\\frac{1}{16}\\)\n\nLand incapable of being irrigated, rendered productive by rain, called in revenue language 'dry grain land' .................. 157\\(\\frac{2}{16}\\)\n\nTotal arable land, wet and dry ......................... 368\\(\\frac{5}{16}\\)\n\nTo this quantity must be added what has been diverted to other purposes, or in revenue language called 'alienated land,' viz.\n\nBy custom ..................................................

C\u00e1nis. 1\\(\\frac{9}{16}\\)\n\nFor the benefit of the temple of Vishnu ................. 1\n\n2\\(\\frac{9}{16}\\)\n\n**Village Corporation Lands.**\n\nFor the benefit of the hereditary village occupants generally ... 1\n\n**Village Corporation Office Lands.**\n\nFor the registrar of the revenue and statistical accounts of the village .................................................. 11\\(\\frac{4}{16}\\)\n\nFor the village watchman .................................. 9\\(\\frac{9}{16}\\)\n\nFor the village carpenter .................................... 1\n\nFor the village blacksmith ................................... 1\n\nAppropriated by custom................................. C\u00e1nis 26\\(\\frac{6}{16}\\)\n\nThe particulars of the appropriations by grant are as follows:\nTo Subramaniya Gurcal, a priest .................................. C\u00e1nis $1\\frac{6}{16}$\nTo ten other Brahmins, all named, but unnecessary to specify in detail ........................................... $9\\frac{5}{16}$\n\nAppropriated by custom .................................................... $11\\frac{5}{16}$\n\nTotal cultivated land, of which the revenue has been appropriated by custom or by grant ........................................ $37\\frac{1}{16}$\n\nThe village occupants retain possession of and cultivate these $37\\frac{1}{16}$ c\u00e1nis, so that the grantees of these lands receive no more than the revenue which would have been payable by custom to the sovereign, supposing the land revenue had not been appropriated as described. The grantees have not possession of the land; and not one of the ten Brahmins alluded to as holding grants of land, resides in the village or cultivates the land of his grant. They send or go annually for the government revenue, which is paid to them in the same way as it would have been paid to the sovereign had no such transfer of his rights been made; but, with a view to keep on good terms with the cultivators of their grants, the grantees generally take less than the sovereign would take, that is, less than half the produce of the land. It is thus obviously advantageous to cultivators to cultivate the land of which the revenue has been assigned for the support of religious, municipal, or other institutions.\n\nThe revenue payable to the sovereign from this village is, by custom, a defined portion of the gross produce from all land cultivated, and not otherwise appropriated by grant or by custom. In seasons of drought there may be little or no revenue, even in grain. In seasons of abundant produce and low price, there may be a large grain revenue and a small money revenue. There is, then, a fluctuation of the amount of revenue, but no fluctuation in the rates of division between the cultivator and sovereign. Previously to a division of the produce of the land between the sovereign and the cultivators, a portion, defined by custom, is deducted for certain defined uses, such as the endowment of the district and village temples, fees of village officers, &c., amounting to about ten per cent. of the gross produce. The cultivators, who have the privilege of cultivating the lands to the exclusion of all other persons, are by custom entitled to retain $42\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent. of the produce which remains after the deduction above referred to, and are bound to pay $57\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent. as revenue.\nDeducted for the endowment of the district and village temples, and fees of village officers, slaves, and labourers, previously to the division of the produce between the cultivator and sovereign.................. 10 per cent.\n\nThe cultivators retain $42\\frac{1}{2}$ in every 90 of gross produce ... $38\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nTotal retained out of the gross produce in this village,\n\nfor the benefit of the village occupants................... $48\\frac{1}{2}$\n\nAmount paid as revenue ........................................ $51\\frac{1}{2}$\n\n$100$\n\nIn the produce of lands not irrigated, the cultivators of this village retain the same share as from the produce of irrigated lands, with the benefit of the usual deductions as detailed in the account of the produce of rice lands. The cultivators, not original settlers, and having no claim to permanent possession of the land, retain by custom a larger portion than the original settlers, both in the produce of wet and dry land. They retain $56\\frac{2}{3}$ per cent. of the produce of both kinds of land after the customary deductions; but they take no share in the produce of the village corporation lands, do not cultivate any portion of the appropriated lands, and pay a fee of superiority to the original settlers in the village.\n\nThe cultivators, who relinquish by custom so large a portion of the produce of the land as revenue to the state, possess advantages, as cultivators of land and village occupants, not capable of being accurately estimated, but of considerable value to the possessors. They divide among themselves the produce of the land exempted from revenue, granted when (to use their emphatic expression) the village was born; they are entitled to levy a fee of superiority from all cultivators not descendants of the original settlers: they can, by custom, sell, mortgage, or give away their village rights: they retain all the straw of all the land cultivated: they have an exclusive right to pasture all the uncultivated lands within the village boundaries: each of them holds, by custom, a moderate-sized garden, free from demands for revenue: they pay no house or poll-tax: they have the labour of the carpenter, blacksmith, potter, washerman, watcher, barber, herdsman, distributor of water to the fields, priests, &c., free of expense, or for a trifling annual donation in cloth or money.\n\nThe reservoir for watering the fields must be kept in repair by the sovereign or by his representative. When the cultivators are impoverished\nby bad seasons or loss of ploughing cattle by disease, custom obliges the sovereign, or his representative, to aid them with advances of money, to be repaid out of the crop of the ensuing year.\n\nThe privileges of the original settlers in this village are held, by custom, in four principal shares, and each principal share is subdivided into sixteen parts, making in all sixty-four shares.\n\nBy the custom of the village a principal share cannot be sold, because a principal share contains the property of many; but custom admits of the sale of a subdivision of a principal share under certain limitations, also defined by custom. The principal shares, viz. the four, are, or are supposed to have been, the shares fixed when the village was first settled. They have remained unaltered, if not for ages, at least for so long a period as tradition or history, or the memory of man reaches. The subdivisions of these principal shares are the portions held by the descendants of the first settlers, or by the purchasers of their rights.\n\nThe land in this village is cultivated with ploughs drawn by oxen, a pair to each plough. Part of the land is ploughed in a dry state and part in a wet state: part is sown broad-cast, and part is set with young rice plants, previously raised in beds, and transplanted into the prepared mud by the females of the families of the labourers and slaves. The irrigated land is divided into portions of a greater or less extent, according to the level of the surrounding land, and is environed with a bank of earth to retain the water. One plough is considered sufficient for the cultivation of from five to six canis of ground during one season of cultivation. In this village a pair of strong bullocks for heavy wet-land work cost fourteen pagodas, or about \u00a35.12s.; a less serviceable pair, about \u00a34.; a still inferior pair may be had for about \u00a32.15s., or \u00a33. A pair of buffaloes would be still cheaper; but they are not in use except among the very poorest class of cultivators, as they do not work well in the heat of the sun.\n\nFrom the poorness of the soil and large portion of the produce paid as revenue, agriculture was represented as not being a profitable pursuit in this village. Many of the cultivators are painters of chintz cloth, and some deal in grain. The produce of a plough worked with two oxen and one driver, is estimated in money at about \u00a34.; and the cost and charges of supporting the slaves or labourers who perform field-work, replacing bullocks, &c., is estimated at from \u00a33. to \u00a33.10s. per plough. In an account delivered to me, and deposited in the Library of the Royal Asiatic\nSociety, the average annual expense of ten ploughs and their drivers is stated to be 100\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) pagodas, or \u00a34. 3s. per plough.*\n\nThe plough-share is of iron, about fourteen inches long, one inch broad, and half an inch thick, fixed into a wooden share with clamps. Drill-ploughs are in use for dry land; and one seen in this village had three shares, and three bamboo tubes with a small wooden cup, into which the pipes or tubes were fixed: the cup is filled by the hand of the driver of the plough, or by a boy following the plough. The common plough is of so slight a construction, that one man can easily carry two or three on his shoulders to the fields. A harrow with wooden teeth is in use.\n\nField labour, when paid in money, which is, however, seldom the case, is paid for at the rate of eight shillings per month; or, at the highest, at ten shillings per month for an able-bodied man. Lads of fifteen or sixteen years of age are, however, quite competent to manage a plough.\n\nWhen the season for cultivation arrives, the arable land of the village is allotted to the several shareholders, in a manner peculiar to villages where wet or rice cultivation predominates. This peculiar mode of allotment has, in all likelihood, arisen from the necessity of making a fair distribution among all the cultivators of the water collected in the tank; the land nearest to the source of supply being, in seasons of drought or a deficient supply of rain, of double the value of that situated at a distance, and beyond the reach of a regular supply of water. The allotment proceeds as follows:\n\nThe names of each lot and of each shareholder are written on pieces of the leaf of the palm tree, such as is used for village records, and the names of each division of land to be allotted are placed in a row. A child, selected for the purpose, draws by lot a leaf with the name of a principal shareholder, and places it under a number thus:\n\n1. Tannappa.  \n2. Nina.  \n3. Narrappa.  \n4. Malliyan.\n\nIt is thus settled, by chance or lottery, that Tannappa and his under-shareholders are entitled to cultivate the land of the principal share lotted under No. 1. Tannappa next proceeds to settle in the same way each under-shareholder's portion included in his principal share; and so on till the sixty-four shareholders receive each his allotment.\n\n* This account includes the produce and value of about an acre of sugar-cane.\nThe lots are not drawn for all the land at once, but in subdivisions according to quality: for instance, for the division nearest the reservoir, as being less liable to the effects of drought, first; then for the next division, as being further removed from the reservoir; and then for the third, which perhaps receives an adequate supply of water once in two or three years only. It is thus apparent, that the object in drawing lots for the annual or periodical occupation of the land, is to secure to each person interested a proportion of each description of land, viz. of the best, the good, and the indifferent; in other words, of the best watered, second best, and so on. Each of these subdivisions of land has an appropriate name in the village register.\n\nThe agricultural labourers employed by the cultivators of this village are of three descriptions:\u20141st. Slaves,* transferred with the other privileges of the village occupants, when those privileges are sold or mortgaged; 2d. Bondsmen, who may be said to have mortgaged themselves, and who can redeem or work out their bondage; 3d. Hired labourers. The slaves, bond-labourers, and hired labourers, are remunerated or supported by allowances of grain and donations of cloth for clothing; their families have the benefit of gleanings and of the sweepings of the treading-floor.\u2020 They have small plots of ground for gardens, free from tax; pay no poll or house-tax; and have presents on marriages or births in their families, and on the new year. The females of their families earn something by beating the husk from the rice; by planting the young rice-plants during the season of sowing and planting; and by doing other labours in the village, rearing poultry, and carrying eggs, poultry, &c. for sale. There did not appear to be much difference in the treatment experienced by the agricultural slaves and that received by agricultural free labourers, except that the latter were paid a larger portion of their remuneration in money, and found themselves in clothes.\n\n* I was shewn in this village a deed of gift of a female, of the agricultural class of slaves, and of her family, dated 131 years ago, written on a palm-leaf of three leaves, curiously and naturally joined, as indicating the sale of three persons, being for a woman and two children; also two other deeds relating to slaves; of these I was promised copies, but did not receive them. An essay on agricultural slavery in the East-Indies will, I trust, be read to the Society at no distant period by one of its members; and authentic information on this subject may be looked for from India.\n\n\u2020 All the grain is trodden out of the straw by driving cattle over it, tied together by the neck.\nHaving thus exhibited the interests of the cultivators in this village, I proceed to detail the interests of the grantee. A reference to the statement in the Appendix will shew, that in the year 1783, the year preceding the grant of the village to the servant of Sir Eyre Coote, a year of war and drought in the Carnatic, the revenue of the sovereign, as collected in grain at the rate of $57\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent. of the produce, after a deduction of 10 per cent., and converted into money by the public servants of the sovereign, amounted to two hundred and eighty-two pagodas. Had the grantee been in possession that year, and had he paid three hundred pagodas as reserved revenue, he would have lost eighteen pagodas, and the expenses of collection also.\n\nThe largest profit exhibited in the statement is in the twenty-first year of possession by the grantee. In that year, although the extent of land cultivated was not above the average quantity, and the grain produced was actually less than that of some of the preceding years, yet the gross revenue in money realized by the grantee amounted to .......... Star pagodas 1,042\n\nThe grantee paid a reserved revenue of .................................. 327\n\nHis gross profit was ......................................................... 715\n\nHis expenses of collection were ........................................... 88\n\nHis net profit was ....................................................... Star pagodas 627\n\nThe very next year but one exhibits another result, viz. an almost entire defalcation of cultivation, owing to a great drought; but an excessively high price, giving great value to a very small produce.\n\nThe gross revenue under these circumstances amounted to Star pags. 215\n\nPayment of the reserved revenue ............................................. 327\n\nLoss ......................... 112\n\nTo which add charges of management and collection for that year ... 55\n\nTotal Loss ............ 167\n\nThe cultivators must equally have experienced the vicissitudes of the seasons; but paying the dues of the grantee in kind, the amount of these dues was in proportion to the produce, and the real loss to the cultivators only that of their labour and seed.\n\nIn describing the respective beneficial interests in this village, I have avoided the use of technical terms. I have not called the village occupants\nproprietors of the soil, landholders, freeholders, copyholders, zemindars, mirasidars, or ryots. The name is of little import, if the benefits they claim exist and are respected. By the grantee they had been respected from A.D. 1784 to 1817, the latter being the year in which these memoranda were taken by me and a friend in the village, in the presence of all the parties interested. To the grantee's interests I have not given a name; he is, obviously, an intermediate agent between the sovereign and the village occupants, with a permanent and extensively beneficial interest: an interest liable, however, as shewn above, to much fluctuation. The interest is derived from the sovereign by the relinquishment of revenue, and not from the occupation of land by the grantee; from ousting the village occupants, or from any encroachment on their rights. The grantee does not possess an acre of land in the village, and has not a single plough of his own; yet it is manifest, if custom permitted him to oust the hereditary occupants, and to employ hired labourers or slaves in their stead, he could in one year increase his income twenty-five per cent. or more, as many of the second class of cultivators will engage to cultivate land, find labour, oxen, and seed, on the condition of retaining something less than one-third of the gross produce. The extent of the revenue relinquished to create the grantee's beneficial interest is shewn to have been, in a good year, star pagodas 627, out of a total revenue of star pagodas 1,042, being more than sixty per cent. In a bad year it is shewn that the reserved revenue paid to the sovereign exceeded the whole amount collected as revenue from the cultivators by 167 star pagodas.\n\nThe beneficial interests in this village are then found to be divided into three classes:\n\n1st. The cultivators of the soil, being the hereditary village occupants.\n2d. The grantee, holding the village by grant from the sovereign, and collecting the sovereign's revenue by virtue of his grant.\n3d. The sovereign, who receives a reserved revenue to be paid by the grantee.\n\nThe details exhibit the following facts:\n\n1st. The undisturbed possession, by the ancestors of the present village occupants and by themselves, from time immemorial, of the lands of the village as defined by known boundaries, on conditions fixed by custom.\n2dly. The uninterrupted payment by the cultivator of a revenue in grain from time immemorial, or without doubt during the last one hundred years, the rates of payment remaining always the same.\n3dly. The receipt of a diminished revenue by the sovereign, owing to an\nappropriation by grant to the servant of the late Sir Eyre Coote, of a portion of what otherwise would have been collected as revenue by the fiscal officers of the sovereign.\n\n4thly. Evidence of the existence of an intermediate agent between the cultivators and payers of revenue and the sovereign as receiver, without injury to the rights of the cultivators.\n\nI conclude these observations with stating, that several thousand villages now under the Madras presidency have, at various times, been transferred in a similar manner, by Hindu, Muhammedan, and British rulers in the East, either on condition of services to be rendered, in reward for past services, or as endowments for charitable or religious institutions; some with a reserved revenue, and others without such reserve, or entirely exempt from the payment of revenue; and that many public native servants of governors, collectors, public boards, and also many distinguished native officers of the Indian army, Muhammedan as well as Hindu, continue to receive such grants. By these grants Muhammedans become the permanent local superiors over Hindus, Sudras the superiors over Brahmans, without such grants being considered as an infringement of any previously existing rights. The grantees receive by grant the rights of the sovereign only; that is, the sovereign's land revenue, and that revenue to be increased only as cultivation increases, and not by encroachment on the rights of the cultivators. It is also a curious fact, that many Hindu temples are endowed both with the beneficial interests of the cultivators by gift, and with the sovereign's revenue by grant. The idol of the temple is thus made proprietor of both the superior and inferior rights; and the land so obtained is cultivated by means of slaves or hired labourers, under the superintendence of the priests of the temple so endowed, or let out to under-tenants.\n\nI have deposited in the library of the Society, for the use of those who may be desirous of further information upon this subject, a complete account for the years A.D. 1741 and 1742, in the greatest detail, of a very large village (yielding, in a favourable season, a revenue of from three to four thousand pounds), in which the whole revenue and statistical economy of the village is exhibited, with the names of each cultivator, the amount of the grain and money revenue, the portion of the produce of the land retained by the cultivator, the portion taken by the sovereign, and the prices at which the reserved grain was sold. I have also deposited in the library a large MS. collection of public and private documents relating to landed tenures in Southern India.\n### Statement showing the Extent of Cultivation, Gross

Extracts from the Peking Gazettes, translated by John Francis Davis, Esq., M.R.A.S.\n\nRead December 1, 1827.\n\nI. Concerning Cases of Homicide.\n\nLeaou-tun-hing, inspector-general of Keang-nan province, presents an address to point out the expediency of early inquests in cases of homicide.\n\nAmidst the great number and variety of imprisonments on criminal accusations, the most important are those which relate to the privation of life. Entering into a conspiracy to kill; killing with malicious intention; killing in an affray; causing death by driving a person to desperation; and killing by culpable negligence, constitute the real or proper cases. The cases of false imprisonment for homicide are where wounds are inflicted after death, to be made the grounds of a false accusation; and where the body is consumed or made away with for the same purpose. In all cases the most speedy investigation is of great importance, since from the nature of the wounds or hurts much evidence may be gathered with respect to the intention or disposition of the person that inflicted them; and from their old or new appearance, an inference may be drawn regarding the truth or falsehood of the accusation. Whenever the district magistrates met with a case of homicide, did they, in every instance, proceed without delay to the inquest of the body, while the wounds or hurts were yet fresh and unchanged, they might with more ease and certainty elicit the truth; at the same time that the guilty persons, being confronted at once with the magistrate before they had time to collect themselves, would be more likely, through fright, to betray their offence. Hence it may be deduced, that early inquests are the best key to the elucidation of homicides. But the magistrates of districts, bearing on their shoulders the responsibility attached to such cases, appear always desirous to suppress them. As soon as a report or accusation is made, they purposely contrive delays, instead of proceeding immediately in person to the inquest, or they\nperhaps send a clerk into the town or village to compel the guilty person, by the agency of money, to make it up with the relations of the deceased, where it happens that these are very poor and needy. Again, the clerks will sometimes frighten the deceased's relations into quiet submission, which enables the magistrate to suppress the trial.* When it happens that the relations will not consent to an accommodation, and the magistrates are left without a choice, they then proceed to an inquest, after many days' delay; and when it happens that the weather is hot, the body becomes so changed as to admit of no true inferences with respect to the cause of death. Again, when the investigation is deferred, the criminal entertains hopes of escape: he pleads guilty to a minor offence to escape the penalties of a heavier; he bribes the official scrutineers (Woo-tso) to slur over the worst appearances of the body; or he buys over the witnesses to support his own statement. Those who conduct the trial are deceived by him, and come to a wrong decision; while the relations of the deceased, wearied with vain endeavours, present an accusation to the higher powers, and a commission is sent to retry the case: but by this time there is little left of the body but the bones, and when these are subjected to the prescribed test by boiling, the hurts which extended to the bones may be ascertained; but the others, as those which might be caused by strangling or poison, it is impossible to prove. Thus, perhaps, the matter is protracted to a whole year, and at\n\n* One very particular feature of the Chinese law of homicide (and certainly a very improper one) is, that it seems instituted, not more for the satisfaction of public justice or the prevention of crime, than for the gratification of private revenge; nay it even goes so far, in some particular cases, as to encourage and justify a principle so subversive of the welfare of society, by awarding a very mitigated punishment to the deliberate murder of any person, in revenge for the death of a father or mother, and even of some inferior relations (Leu-Lee, sect. cccxxiii, page 352, of Sir G. T. Staunton's Penal Code of China). In most Chinese trials for homicide, it is evident that the relations are the real prosecutors: although among us it is treated purely as an offence against the public. To this antiquated error in legislation, the considering murder as a private wrong, and the possibility of compromising so great an offence against society by a bribe to the relations of the deceased, may be attributed many of the evils complained of in the above paper. We may learn from this, and indeed from the actual experience of the past, to recognize the spirit in which cases of homicide are prosecuted against Europeans at Canton. In nearly every instance where the point has been vehemently or obstinately urged, the relations have spurred on the local government by threats of an appeal to Peking if their revenge remained unsatisfied; and we may rest assured, that an adequate compromise in money, if offered in time, would almost always be successful, though the policy and propriety of such a measure in many cases might very fairly be questioned.\nlength it becomes a very serious case. If the cause of this be sought, it will be found to consist in \"the neglect of an early inquest.\" Thus, in the instance of the trial at T\u00e8-tsing H\u00eben* in Ch\u00eb-keang province, where the woman Seu-ne-she was found to have strangled the woman Seu-tsa-e-she, had the Che-H\u00eben proceeded immediately to the inquest, the truth might have been elicited at once, without the necessity of repeated trials.\n\nThe object of this address is to intreat your Majesty to command the viceroy and governor of every province to provide for a speedy inquest in every case of homicide; and if there is any attempt to delay or suppress matters on the part of the magistrates, to recommend their immediate dismissal. Those magistrates will thus be put upon their guard for the future; bad practices will be restrained, and imprisonments on accusations of homicide diminished in number.\n\nII. Scarcity of Grain in F\u00fbh-k\u00eben province to be supplied from Ch\u00eb-keang, by Sea.\n\nSun-urh-chun (viceroy of F\u00fbh-k\u00eben and Ch\u00eb-keang) has recommended a temporary relaxation of the restrictions on the coasting trade, and the holding out of encouragement to merchants to import grain from Ch\u00eb-keang by sea.\u2020 In the past year, the harvest of rice in F\u00fbh-k\u00eben province has been so bad as to raise the price of grain to an unusual height. The said viceroy states that the harvest in Ch\u00eb-keang has been comparatively plentiful, and the coasting navigation affords such facilities for transmission, that he recommends some relaxation of the restrictions upon it, as an encouragement to merchants to supply the wants of the people.

Geographical Notice of the Frontiers of the Burmese and Chinese Empires, with the Copy of a Chinese Map. By John Francis Davis, Esq., M.R.A.S.\n\nRead December 15, 1827.\n\nThe great interest which now attaches to the geography of the Burmese empire and to its relations with the Chinese, seems to call for as much information as can by any means be procured on these subjects from different quarters. In the Chinese library of the East-India Company at Canton is a MS. map, chiefly compiled from the labours of the missionaries; and as its extreme accuracy can be vouched for with respect to those parts of the empire through which Lord Amherst's embassy passed, it is entitled to a degree of credit, which is not hastily to be awarded to Chinese maps in general. An exact copy has been taken from this map of the western part of Yun-nan province. Our latest geographical knowledge of the Burmese country is contained in a map recently published at Calcutta, with the permission of the Bengal government; and as that portion which relates to the Chinese frontier was likely to have been obtained from Burmese sources, it may be worth while to compare it with the Chinese map. As far as relates to the names of places, the Chinese character is the only sure guide within their own territory. Little accuracy can be expected from, or stress laid on, the names written by one set of strangers, the English, and obtained by them through the mouths, or the writing, of another set of strangers, the Burmese. Notwithstanding this difficulty, however, it will perhaps be found that a considerable degree of correspondence exists between the two maps.\n\nThe great river Loo-keang forms, according to both maps, the boundary of the Chinese empire from lat. $27^\\circ$ to $26^\\circ$, where it enters Yun-nan province, and issuing from it again about lat. $24^\\circ$, proceeds nearly due south. Serving, during a considerable part of its course, as the boundary\nN.B.

Keung, or Large River.\nline of Ava and Siam, it empties itself into the sea below Martaban, after performing a course of more than 660 geographical miles. The map of the Chinese, however, does not extend in any part beyond their own frontier.\n\nIn the Chinese map, immediately on the border of Yun-nan, and just below 25\u00b0 lat., we find a place called \u76ca\u9054 Tsan-t\u0103, the Santa of the English map. This is distinguished by Du Halde with the title of \u5e9c Foo, or city of the first order: while in the MS. map it is merely put down as a \u571f\u53f8 Too-sze, and there is no chief city to the westward of \u6c38\u660c\u5e9c Yung-chang-Foo. On the outskirts of the Chinese empire, \u4ea4\u754c Keaou-keae (\"where the frontiers blend,\") towards the west, are a number of towns or stations called by them \u571f\u53f8 Too-sze, where the original natives of the country are more or less independent, and where there is in fact a kind of divided authority, each party being immediately subject to its own chiefs. This is particularly the case of the Meaou-tsze and Lo-los. The Chinese map mentions Tsan-t\u0103, or Santa, as one of these stations, and not as a chief town; and Du Halde himself observes of it: \"Cette derni\u00e8re ville, qui confine avec le royaume d'Ava, est proprement une ville de guerre, pour servir de defense \u00e0 cette fronti\u00e8re:\" which description does not correspond with what the Chinese call a Foo.\n\nThe \u6ab3\u6994\u6c5f Pin-lang-Keang of the Chinese map, flowing into the Burmese territory immediately below Tsan-t\u0103, is called in our map Pan-mo-keang, and represented as united with the Irawadi at Bhan-mo, or Pan-mo; while the \u9f8d\u5ddd\u6c5f Lung-chuen-Keang, a little below to the southward, is named Shueli Myeet, and also flows into the Irawadi. The relative position of these two rivers is pretty nearly the same in both maps, but there is considerable disagreement in the position of the towns or stations on their borders; and on this subject it is probable that the Chinese map is best entitled to credit of the two. In the latter, advancing from the frontier inwards, on the Lung-chuen river, we see \u731b\u536f Meng-maou, or Meng-mo, \u9f8d\u5ddd Lung-chuen, \u5357\u7538 Nan-t\u00eben, and \u81a8\u8d8a Teng-yu\u00eb, the three former marked as Too-sze, and the last as a Chow, or town of the second order. In the English map, however, the first station is Lung-chuen (improperly written Fou-se, instead of Too-sze); the second Nan-\ntaen (Nan-tseen), and the third Tong-ye-chew (Teng-yue-chow), constituting\nthe three first stages on the route from Ava towards Yun-nan city: and\nthese three stations are placed on the northern stream, corresponding with\nthe Pin-lang-Keang, instead of that which answers to the Lung-chuen-\nKeang of the Chinese map, to the southward. Now I should think, from\nthe name of the first of these, Lung-chuen, that it is properly placed in the\nMS. map on Lung-chuen river, and consequently the two others; and that\nthe route towards Yun-nan, in fact, lies on the southern stream instead of\nthe northern. Were this found to be the fact, Lung-chuen-Keang would\nalso be the real Bhan-mo or Pan-mo-Keang. This seems to be confirmed by\nthe Chinese map. Below Lung-chuen station towards Ava, we find imme-\ndiately on the border Meng-maou, or as it is pronounced in the south,\nMeng-mo, which I think is very likely to be intended for Bhan-mo or Pan-\nmo, called Bamoo by Symes, and stated by him to be the chief point of\ncommercial intercourse between the two countries. The spirit of Chinese\nencroachment might be disposed to include this in their own map, with\nsome violation of its real locality.\n\nWith respect to the route laid down in the English map, from Bhan-mo\nthrough Yung-chang-Foo and Ta-le-Foo, towards Yun-nan city, it is not\nlikely that the natives of Ava are frequently allowed to enter so far into the\nChinese territory. This is more probably the track of the merchants and\nemissaries of the latter, in their commercial speculations towards the\nfrontier. Symes states, that the Chinese envoys, whom he found at Ame-\nrapura, were, as far he could ascertain, merely a provincial deputation, and\nnot imperial ambassadors from Peking. This indeed is most likely, being\nin unison with the general maxims of Chinese foreign policy. They say,\n\"attach no value to what is foreign, and strangers will resort to you.\"\n\nIt is deserving of notice, that Mancheegee is mentioned by Symes as the\nBurmese name for Yun-nan; and that Mangee is the name given by Marco\nPolo to the southern part of China. The northern he calls Cathay.\n\nThe country which forms the western part of Yun-nan province is allowed\nto be mountainous, wild, and thinly peopled; and I understand from P\u00e8re\nL'Amiot, who has resided more than thirty years at Peking, that it is con-\nsidered by the Chinese as unhealthy. It was his fortune to fall in with a\nTartar officer who had served in the army sent against the Burmese empire\nin 1767, and stated by Symes to have amounted to fifty thousand men, of\nwhich army very few individuals escaped back to their own country. The\ntotal failure of this great enterprize was attributed by the said Tartar officer to the unhealthiness of the climate: but when a due allowance has been made for the influence of national feeling and Chinese want of candour, a considerable portion of their disasters may be referred to the prowess of the invaded enemy.\n\nThe stream, called in the MS. map \u6f2b\u8def\u6cb3 Man-loo-Ho, seems to be the commencement of the great river of Siam, which reaches the sea at Bankok.\n\nThe \u4e5d\u9f8d\u6c5f Keu-lung-Keang, or river of the nine dragons, which after collecting a number of tributary streams in Yun-nan province, traverses an immense expanse, and finally empties itself into the sea at the southern extremity of Cambodia, does not yield to the Yang-tsze-Keang itself in the length of its course, and may be classed among the principal rivers of our globe.\n\nP\u00e8re L\u2019Amiot, at my particular request, obligingly supplied me with some detached notes relating to Yun-nan province; and I have his permission to subjoin a selection from them:\n\n\"La province de Yun-nan est r\u00e9gie par un Tsung-too, ou viceroi, qui gouverne aussi la province de Kwei-chow.

An Autobiographical Memoir of the early Life of Nana Farnevis.\nTranslated from the original Mahratta, by Lieutenant-Colonel John Briggs, M.R.A.S., late Resident at the Court of Satara.\n\nRead April 19, 1828.\n\nThis piece of biography may truly be considered one of the most remarkable productions of oriental literature.\n\nNana Farnevis became at a very early period the bosom friend of his sovereign Madhu Rao, entitled the Great. This young prince succeeded his father in the year 1761, shortly after the fatal battle of Paniput, which seemed to threaten the downfall of the Mahratta power in Hindustan. He was then only in his seventeenth year, and Nana but nineteen. The latter had been hitherto brought up to the study of the Vedas and Sutras, but had as yet engaged little in the duties of a public office, which his father had filled till Nana was fifteen, and which was now occupied by his uncle Babu Rao. The office to which I have alluded was hereditary, and had been held for three generations by Nana's family. It was that of Farnevis or Fard-nevis (literally, record-writer), but its duty was more especially to keep the accounts of the Peshwa's public receipts and disbursements. A situation, which brought those who filled it so constantly in contact with the Peshwa, was favourable to the development of those qualities which the youthful prince Madhu Rao discovered in his juvenile secretary. An attachment grew up between them, terminating only in the Peshwa's death, an event which occurred in 1774, at the early age of twenty-eight.\n\nThe part which Nana Farnevis took in the Poona government subsequent to that period, rendered him the chief director of all its political movements till the death of Madhu Rao the Second, which happened in 1797. From that period he was engaged in contending with the late Peshwa Baji Rao for that authority which he was unwilling to relinquish, but which he failed to attain. In March 1800 Nana Farnevis died, after having retired from public business, leaving behind him the reputation of being one of the greatest men of his time and country.\nAccidentally placed in communication with many of his contemporaries, and interested in obtaining every information regarding this celebrated personage, I procured several narratives of the events which occurred under the eyes of some of my native friends to be written for me by them; and in the course of my inquiries, I was enabled to gain access to his private papers, to the number of nine thousand. Among these were several hundred written in Nana's own hand, which cannot easily be mistaken. After many copious selections of the most interesting, I translated many of these documents, and brought them with me to this country.\n\nIn the course of these investigations a confidential clerk of the family brought me the curious relic, the translation of which is presented to the Society. The paper in question is a life of Nana in his own hand-writing, commencing with his birth, and coming down only to the period when his patron, Madhu Rao the Great, ascended the throne, and when Nana was himself only nineteen years of age.\n\nNana's official career is a subject of public record and history, but his private life at any stage must naturally excite the utmost interest. That he should have written his life at all is certainly a very remarkable circumstance; but the identity of his hand-writing, which I took pains not only to scrutinize myself, as far as I was able, but which I submitted to the inspection and examination of a vast number of disinterested persons, was never for a moment doubted by them.\n\nHaving endeavoured to establish this fact, I shall proceed at once to the translation, which begins thus:\n\n\"Let me consider what is the semblance of the face of God. It is the emblem of truth, full of animation, and resplendent with its own effulgence. God passes his existence in watchfulness, in sleep, and in contemplation. His watchfulness is apparent throughout all animated nature; his contemplation is displayed in the light of day; his sleep is typified in the stillness of night. He, to whom we attribute these qualities, is THE ONLY ONE\u2014THE SPIRIT.\n\n\"It is he, who in the plentitude of his power displays himself in every thing. He is everywhere present at the same moment, moving without feet, seeing without eyes, touching without hands, hearing without ears, pervading all space.\n\n\"If it be asked from what are we to conclude the Great Spirit pervades all space, and that it is a single and sole spirit? I reply, that we derive\nthis knowledge from the conviction of our reason, and from an innate consciousness arising out of sympathy. Thus how often does it occur, when men assemble, though sitting at a distance from each other, that they communicate their thoughts by a look or a gesture, just as a mirror reflects an image.\n\nNow it is evident, that if the spirit in those bodies were not the same and identified, this union of sentiment could not occur.\n\nThe soul of man partakes of the nature of the spirit of God, and to every human being is allotted a portion of its glory; but, regardless and unmindful of this truth, man relinquishes the contemplation of the greatness of God, and pursues what he considers the apparent advantage which presents itself to him in this world of misery. Such, however, is consistent with human nature. It is m\u0101y\u0101 (illusion or desire) with which he is filled, and which prompts him to action. M\u0101y\u0101 can neither be considered substantial, nor positively illusory, no more than the face of God can be seen or accurately described. M\u0101y\u0101 influences the conduct of man in three ways: it leads him sometimes to do good, sometimes to be selfish, and sometimes to be vicious, but its prevailing tendency is to engender pride. The spirit produced the firmament of heaven, after which air, light, water and earth, were made. These five elements we designate by the term Mah\u0101bh\u016bt.\n\nIn the midst of these is seated the soul, endued with reason, and surrounded by the five mah\u0101bh\u016bts, or elements. The soul is eternal; it is unconnected with the perishable body wherein it is placed, but from which it is distinct. The human frame is material; it is compounded of the five elements, and is thus rendered capable of partaking of worldly pleasure and of pain. It is calculated merely to receive sensual impressions. It is begotten in shame; it is engendered, and becomes matured in labour; and is liable to destruction, even before it is brought into existence. It is condemned to a mortification of nine months in the womb, is eventually born in pain, and enters a world full of misery and affliction. For a lengthened period it is incapable of assisting itself, or of asking relief: but gradually acquiring size by imbibing aliment, the bones and the muscles acquire strength, the blood is nourished, and in the end the infant-form assumes the shape of man.\n\nOf such materials then am I formed. Born* in the depths of ignorance,\n\n* On Friday, 24th of February 1742, at 10 o'clock p.m.\nand involved in utter darkness. But, owing to certain advantages acquired in some former state, I was early disposed to worship the Deity. This tendency displayed itself when I was yet a child, at which time I was in the habit of forming lumps of clay into the shapes which are commonly put up in the temples, and with which I used to play and perform the sacrificial rites. Not content with these, I often stole the household images of the family, and carried them away to some secret place, where I might go through the forms of our religious ceremonies undisturbed. For these petty thefts I frequently suffered punishment at my mother's hands. Both my parents were extremely desirous that I should early acquire knowledge, and did not fail to urge me to study; but my own stubbornness provoked me to resist their advice, and to be sulky whenever spoken to on the subject; so much so that I always wished some evil might happen to them.\n\nI was not contracted in marriage till I was ten years of age (1752); and at the age of eleven or twelve I began to feel the influence of the passions: which, together with the bad society into which I accidentally fell at this period, gave me vicious propensities. About this time I fell accidentally from my horse, and was insensible for two days: but by the intervention of Providence I recovered.\n\nMy father died when I had attained my fifteenth year (1757), and God permitted me to be present to perform his funeral obsequies. After which, perceiving his Highness the Peshwa disposed to be kind to me, from his treating me as his own child, I accompanied him to the field of battle, and went as far as Seringapatam. After my return my marriage was consummated. I found, however, my propensity to the society of loose females extremely difficult to control; and I always reflected with shame and remorse on my own conduct, when I remembered that my worthy grandfather was a man as celebrated for his morality and virtue, as for his charity and religion, and that all my father's relatives were highly pious men. With these reflections I made up my mind to believe that I derived my evil propensities from my mother's side, but this did not correct the bent of my inclination.\n\nI however resolved to go to Toka on the Godaveri, and by a strict attention to devotion and to the service of the temple, obtain grace to overcome my evil dispositions. I remained there for some time, till at length Bhao Sahib (the Peshwa's brother) marched with an army into\n\"Hindustan. (Oct. 2, 1759). I accompanied him, taking with me my mother\nand my wife, for the purpose principally of making pilgrimages to the holy\ncities of Benares, Pray\u00e1g (Allahabad), and Gaya, and of becoming purified\nin the waters of the Ganges. As my frame was at this period afflicted with\na disease which reduced my strength and animal spirits, I found my mind\nmore composed and fitted for devotion than when I was in rude health.\nMy whole life and soul were now wrapt up in veneration for religion and\nrespect for my mother, who greatly encouraged my religious feelings.\nAfter crossing the Nerbudda I fell sick, and was afflicted with dysen-\ntery to such a degree that I could not rise. His Highness Bhao Sahib,\nout of his great consideration, ordered the army to halt for some days,\ntill I got better. We reached the Chumbul at the period of an eclipse,\nand eventually arrived on the Jumna at the Gow Ghaut. We then pro-\nceeded to Mathura, where having performed the religious ceremonies\nenjoined at the temples, we went to Vrind\u00e1van (Binderabun). Here I\nbathed in the very pool where the divine Crishna crushed the serpent\nKalya. We also saw the remains of the very kadam-tree (Nauclea Orien-\ntalis), in which the god concealed himself after having stolen away the\nclothes of the shepherdesses who were bathing in the holy stream. At\nBinderabun we visited the several temples of Atal-beh\u00e1n\u00ed, Kunj-beh\u00e1n\u00ed,\nBanki-beh\u00e1n\u00ed, R\u00e1dh\u00e1-Kish\u00f3r, and G\u00f3rvind-ji; all dedicated to the god\nCrishna in his various shapes. I also assisted for some time in performing\nthe duties of the temple of Kunj Beh\u00e1n\u00ed. I visited the tree of R\u00e1dh\u00e1\n(where Crishna assisted to dress his mistress), as also the wows\u00ed-tree,\nunder which he used to recline and play on his pipe. I likewise visited\nthe S\u00e9va Ban and Kunj Ban, two groves where the god used to retire.\nThe trees of the latter are rather low in stature; but they are very\nthickly studded with branches and leaves, affording a permanent shade.\nThe grove abounds in trees of all kinds: but those, whose nature it is to\nhave thorns in other places, here have none. I was much delighted in\nthese groves, and could fancy them still the retired abode of some\ndivinity.\n\nI also went and rolled in the Ramal Reti (soft sand-hills in the bed of\nthe Jumna), which still remain as in the time of the god.\nOne afternoon I paid a visit to the holy persons who reside at the spot\ncalled Dny\u00e1n G\u00e1jri, with whom I was much pleased; and before dark I\nperformed (Sandhya) prayers and ablutions at the Dh\u00edr Sum\u00edr, so called\nfrom the gentle and cool breezes which blow there in the evening across\nthe waters of the Jumna. This ceremony I continued for four days; and\nI felt that all the members of my body, and my senses which had partaken\nof my devotions, were sanctified by the performance. While at Bin-\nderabun I could not help feeling a veneration for every thing I saw; and\neven the holy men who sat in the Kunj Ban at different places, subsisting\neither wholly by drinking water, or by merely eating leaves and grass,\ninspired me at once with a sensation of respect and pleasure. One of\nthese devotees, calling me to him, whispered a moral sentence into my ear,\nwhich he desired me to repeat frequently every day, and to act up to it.\nFrom Binderabun I went to Delhi, where, according to his Highness\u2019s\norders, I paid my respects to (PRIT\u2019HIV\u00cd PATI) the \u2018King of the Earth,\u2019\nwho received me with great affability, and presented me with robes of\nhonour. On the same day, while sitting with his Highness, the sensation\nof an earthquake was experienced. During my residence at Delhi, I\npurchased a number of pictures,* taking care to make a selection free\nfrom all immodest and indecent representation.\n\nAt this period information was received, that in the north an army of\nYavanas (Muhammedans), consisting of 75,000 men, had arrived on the\nwest bank of the Jumna: but owing to the river being full from bank\nto bank, both armies\u2020 remained separated. His Highness however\nmarched and occupied Kunjpura, in spite of the enemy\u2019s efforts to\nprevent him. I accompanied the division which attacked, and God\nspared my life. The Muhammedans now forced the passage of the river,\nand were opposed by his Highness. I was a mere boy; and his Highness,\nthough sufficiently wise on all other occasions, seems on this to have lost\nhis usual wisdom. My maternal uncle Balwant Rao, and Nana Puran-\ndar\u00ed, his Highness\u2019s natural advisers, were set aside, and Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed\nSankar and Sh\u00e1h New\u00e1z Kh\u00e1n became favourite counsellors; in con-\nsequence of which he abandoned our system of warfare, and adopted\nthat of the enemy. We were surrounded, and the enemy\u2019s shot fell\nthickly among our tents daily. My mother and wife screamed with alarm,\nbut I endeavoured to console them by desiring them to trust in\nGod. At length my mother\u2019s brother \u2020 was killed, and had it not been\n\n* He preserved this taste for paintings through life.\n\u2020 The army of the Peshwa and that of the Muhammedans.\n\u2021 Balwant Rao Crishna Mehindli.\nfor the approach of darkness, we should all have been destroyed on that night. Thus we remained in a state of siege for two months, during which most of the cattle of the army died, and the stench was dreadful. My aunt insisted on burning with her husband's body. Previously to the last fatal action, his Highness had determined to destroy all the females of his family rather than suffer them to fall into the hands of the enemy, and I took the same resolution. We both left persons with them, to perform the dreadful office in case of defeat. The battle at length commenced.* His Highness, though wise, valiant and experienced, had latterly become proud and arrogant; and although the arrangement for the action was good, yet he did not attend to it himself, nor did others. Confusion prevailed in every direction. I remained close to his Highness, but was able to do nothing, except to pray to God to save us. Wisw\u00e1s Rao \u2020 fell by a cannon-shot, when his Highness taking him up on his elephant, stood fast. The Afghans dismounted from their horses, and stormed the camp on all sides. The battle was now brought to cuts and slashes. In this state of affairs the great officers of the left wing shewed the example of flight. On the right, Sindia and Holkar stood aloof, and at last the royal standard was seen to retreat. Around his Highness there were now only about two hundred men left, and he looked stupified as if unable to see what passed about him. Bapuj\u00ed Pant told me to go to the rear: I replied, 'I cannot quit his Highness at such a moment;' but God prompted me soon after to follow his advice. I turned my horse's head. Of one hundred thousand men, among whom were many great officers of distinction, not one stood by his Highness at such a moment, though I had heard them repeatedly swear in the time of peace, that rather than a hair of his head should be touched, they would each sacrifice a thousand lives if they had them: so that they turned out to be the mere companions of his prosperity, and deserters in the hour of adversity.\n\nWhen I consider how he conciliated his chiefs with blandishments, what honours, presents and estates he had conferred on them, and how he had exerted himself to win their affections, it is matter of surprise to\n\n* January 15, 1761.\n\u2020 Wisw\u00e1s Rao, the eldest and favourite son of the Peshwa, accompanied his uncle Bhao Sahib in this campaign.\n\"reflect, that in the moment of trial he should have been so completely\nabandoned that no one knew how he fell, or what became of that person\nwho so lately was the object of such great veneration.\n\n\"The rout became general, and I reached Paniput just as the sun set in\nthe heavens. Here was I, a stranger, without knowing an inch of my\nroad, when Providence sent me a guide in the person of R\u00e1m\u00e1j\u00ed Pant,\nwho advised me to abandon my horse and strip off my clothes, which I\ndid, and we set off during the night. Before I had gone three miles I\nwas examined by half-a-dozen bands of the cap-wearers, and they seldom\nfailed to kill or wound ten or twelve of our party. That I escaped is\nonly to be ascribed to the providence of God. Both R\u00e1m\u00e1j\u00ed Pant and\nB\u00e1p\u00e1j\u00ed Pant staid close to me, and before daylight we had gained ten\ncoss* to the westward. Here we fell in with a body of the enemy, who\nwounded both my friends R\u00e1m\u00e1j\u00ed Pant and B\u00e1p\u00e1j\u00ed Pant very severely;\nnot one was spared with the exception of me alone, who contrived to\nhide myself in some long grass, when God preserved me. I was thus\ncompelled to proceed alone. I wandered two coss farther, when more of\nthe enemy came in sight. I had recourse again to the long grass; but\nthey discovered and dragged me forth, when an old man of the party said,\n'he is but a boy, let him go;' and they were thus induced to spare me.\nI had been ill before the battle, and had eaten little food for many days;\nbut the dangers I had lately incurred seemed to have roused me, and I\nwalked even without food nearly fifteen coss on the second day. At\nlength, finding myself very hungry, I endeavoured to eat some leaves of\nthe ber-tree,\u2020 but could not swallow them. I went on, till at last I\nreached the outside of a village just as the day closed. A Bairdg\u00ed (holy\nmendicant) went and brought me some flour, which I made up into a\ncake and ate. I never tasted so delicious a morsel, it was sweet as the\nnectar of heaven. I slept there during the night; and in the morning\ncontinued my journey, repeating some prayers and calling on the name of\nGod. During the day I reached another village, and was hospitably\nreceived by a banker. I was recognized also by Yeswant Rao, a c\u00e1r\u0107\u00fan\n(clerk) in the riding-school department. Here Yeswant Rao and I both\ntook our meal together; but we were roused by information of the\n\n* About twenty miles.\n\u2020 The fruit resembles an olive in appearance, but in taste is not unlike an apple. It is the zizyphus jujube.\nenemy's horse having penetrated into the town. The banker offered to hire a carriage for us, and to send us to Jayanagar: we gladly accepted his proposal, and set off on our journey. At length it occurred to me, that the carriage would certainly attract the attention of the enemy's horse if they were in the neighbourhood; so I resolved to quit it and go on foot. Our party now consisted of three or four Brahmins and five or six Mahhattas; and we went on without molestation for seven days, begging our way, and depending on Providence for every meal we ate, till at last we reached Rewari. We found that a great part of the army had already fled by this route. At this place one Bank\u00ed Rao had been very particular in his inquiries regarding me, as I understood from a number of people I recognized in the town. As I knew nothing of this person, and could not conceive what his intentions were, I was averse to discovering myself, but at length I made myself known to him. He took me instantly to his house, and treated me and all my party with great kindness and hospitality; he then furnished me with some clothes; and on its being made known who I was to R\u00e1mj\u00ed D\u00e1s, a merchant of the place, he came and begged of me to occupy a part of his house. Here I was entertained with great attention for some days. My wish now was to proceed to Deeg and Bhurtpore, but it was requisite to have an escort. At length a wedding-party was going in that direction; and hiring a carriage, I accompanied it. On the road I was met by Crishna Bhatt Vaidya (doctor), who told me that V\u00edr\u00e1j\u00ed Bh\u00e1warik\u00e1r had saved my wife, and having taken care of her, had left her in the house of Naro Pant Gokla in the village of Jigny, where they had procured for her clothes and all that she required. I accordingly went to Jigny, and was much delighted to find my wife again, for whom I now hired another carriage, and we proceeded to Deeg, where Purush\u00f3ttam Madh\u00e9o Hirigui* had come from the field of Paniput, and was living in the house of a gom\u00e1shta (agent) of Wanoli, who had a banking-office in that town. The moment the agent heard of my arrival he insisted on our going to put up with him, where I remained with my wife for a full month. I found my appetite had increased from my exertions greatly, and there was neither want of clothes nor of good food in abundance. I made every inquiry for my poor mother, but all that I could ever hear of her was\n\n* Then, and for many years afterwards, the Delhi news-writer of Poona.\n\"from one of my own khidmutgars (domestics), who said he saw her cut\ndown while sitting on her horse, and believed that she died instantly.\nThis is the only account I ever obtained of her fate. Having now sup-\nplied ourselves with horses and a palki, I went by the route of Dhowl-\npore to Gwalior. Here the bulk of the army that survived the action\nhad arrived before me. Among others were Parwat\u00ed Bhye,* Nana\nPurander\u00ed, Mulharj\u00ed Holkar, and several others. My own wish at this\ntime was to retire and to reside permanently at Benares, having had\nample experience of the delights of a public life; but it is vain to oppose\nthe decrees of fate, and I was prevailed on in the first place to revisit\nhome,\u2020 to perform the obsequies for my mother among our relations, and\nthen to act according to circumstances. I began to reflect what might\nhappen to me if I went to Benares and left all those I was acquainted\nwith; so I quitted Gwalior and marched south with the army.\n\nI heard that when his Highness Nana Sahib \u2021 received the news of\nthe battle of Paniput, he asked Guruji particularly about me, and said,\n'he is a poor sickly creature, how will he ever survive, even if he is not\nkilled by the enemy?' But, by the care of Providence, I was preserved\nthrough all these dangers and difficulties. At Berhampur I had the\nhappiness to see Nana Sahib; but I found him sadly afflicted, and his\nframe much reduced. Indeed his intellect seemed affected sometimes;\nand contrary to custom, he was in the habit of abusing grossly the\nmilitary chiefs. To me, however, even at these moments, he was\nextremely kind, and seemed anxious to know from my mouth every\nparticular relating to the battle. Narayan Rao\u00a7 having caught the\nsmall-pox in Malwa, he was left with Gop\u00edka Bhye || on the Nerbudda,\nto follow after Nana Sahib to the Deccan on his return. Moreover,\nsome disagreement had lately taken place between them.\u00b6 Thus it is,\nthat, when people act contrary to the manner of the times, untoward\ncircumstances will necessarily arise out of them. Seeing that affairs did\nnot wear a pleasing aspect at court, I asked permission to go at once to\nmy temple at Toka, where I again took up my former residence.

I was much in want of a s\u00faligr\u00e1ma,* and ventured to ask his Highness if he could spare me one. He replied with the utmost kindness, 'go into my tent and take your choice from amongst all I have.' I accordingly selected one. The next day was a fast with me; and as it happened to be the anniversary of Baji Rao Sahib's death,\u2020 I was sent for to dine with him. I was obliged to excuse myself on the score of its being my fast day. His Highness however insisted on my going; I spoke to the domestic priest about it, but I found I should give offence if I staid away. When the dinner was brought in, the Peshwa made his Highness Madhu Rao sit on one side and me on the other, close to him; and while the females were putting down the dishes under his new wife's superintendence, he constantly corrected her in their arrangement; and during dinner he caused her to help me to some dishes, as if I were one of the family.\n\nOn his leaving Toka I begged permission to remain behind for some time, till my mind had recovered its composure from the scenes which I had lately witnessed, and the afflictions I had endured: to which he gave his consent. His Highness went on to Poona; but his mind was evidently suffering severely, till at length, just before his death, I received a summons to repair quickly to Poona, and I had actually set off and gone as far as Parnere, where I received the news of his death.\n\nI had received a letter from his Highness Dada Sahib, telling me by all means to come immediately; and I at last arrived at Poona. I was much afflicted at the news of his Highness's death, which took place at the Parbat\u00ed;\u2021 but I was very graciously received by his Highness Dada Sahib, who shortly after\u00a7 took his Highness Madhu Rao Sahib to Sat\u00e1ra to receive the clothes of investiture, and ordered me to go with him. He was very anxious also for me to accompany them when the Raja gave the clothes; but I begged to be excused, saying, his Highness was my immediate sovereign, and I did not wish to be introduced to the Raja.\n\nAfter his investiture, Madhu Rao Sahib having had his audience of leave, we returned to Poona.\n\n---\n\n* A particular kind of stone, used in religious ceremonies, containing one or more ammonites.\n\u2020 10th of May.\n\u2021 24th June 1761.\n\u00a7 21st July 1761.\n\"On the road, one day, an infantry soldier seized a young woman in a field and threw her down, with the intention of committing a rape: one of the troopers on duty,* observing it, galloped up and pierced him to the heart with his spear. Thus I had before me an example of the consequences of indulgence in the passions.\n\nOn the next day his Highness crossed the Nira, but I remained that day at Sirioul; and owing to the swelling of the river I was obliged to go in a boat: but the force of the current carried us down the stream. The boatmen declared they could do nothing; and we had come close to some rocks, and must have been dashed to pieces in a few minutes. I called on God to assist us; when two of the boatmen had the boldness to leap overboard, and gaining the bank, were able to drag the boat to the shore, by which means we were all preserved.\n\nThis providential circumstance was brought about through the intervention of Vishnu the preserver.\n\nI then went on to Poona, and was shortly after called on by his Highness to resume the functions of my office as Farnevis.\"\n\nHaving finished this remarkable narrative, it seems incumbent on me to make some observations on its character. No one can doubt, who has attended to the beautiful introduction of this piece of biography, that its author had very sublime ideas of the nature of the Deity, whom he represents as 'The Only One\u2014The Spirit,' who pervades all space, being everywhere present at the same moment, and omnipotent. This is, in fact, the true and original basis of the Hindu religion, though, like others which profess a belief in one God, it has in the course of time dwindled into the grossest idolatry. Polytheism received its first shape when the attributes of the 'Only One' became personified in his character of Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer, and mankind conceived that in worshipping symbols of his power in these several capacities, they were likely the more readily to attain the objects of their prayers. In order therefore to propitiate the Deity in his character, either of Maha Deva, Vishnu, or Siva, the people made vows to render offerings to their temples in cases of success. In order to confer\n\n* On the occasion of the march of troops through the country, it is usual to post safeguards to protect the persons and property of the inhabitants; and it is concluded, that the trooper, meeting with resistance from the foot-soldier, felt himself authorized to act as he did.\nadditional sanctity on these proceedings, priests became requisite, and idols were manufactured at their suggestion, representing the pure divinity in a fanciful personification. The transition from the worship of material resemblances of a divinity to that of eminent and worthy princes, who had gained the hearts of their subjects, was simple, and accorded with the wishes of the people. So that after the death of their heroes, we may easily imagine how natural it was for the Hindus to place Rama, Lachshman, Hanuman, and Krishna (no doubt once real characters) among the number of their gods. It is thus, therefore, I think we may account for the existence of the Hindu Pantheon of the present day. That some respect for the character of these demi-gods prevails, even among the better classes of the Hindu nation at this moment, cannot be denied; but that learned Brahmins and men well-informed, who are otherwise intelligent, worship them with any degree of faith, may very fairly be doubted; while it would appear that Nana Farnevis had no such faith, even when a boy. The whole tenour of the manuscript I have translated proves that the belief in which he had been brought up taught him to place his whole reliance on the 'Only One.' It is on him he was accustomed to call in the hour of danger and in the day of battle, when all hope was lost. It was in him he placed his whole trust and confidence, when unarmed he fell into the hands of the sanguinary and relentless enemy. It was on him he called when tossed by the waters, the vessel was almost sure of being dashed against the rocks; and it was to him, in his character of Vishnu the preserver, that he offered up his thanks and devotions when he was almost miraculously snatched from the perils by which he was surrounded.\n\nThe exalted and pure notions that Nana Farnevis entertained of the Creator, are strongly contrasted with his notions of the abject condition of the creature. He describes man as a being compounded of perishable materials, and who in his animal capacity is only capable of partaking of worldly pleasure and pain, but whose frame is filled with a portion of the divine spirit, which, being separate from the body, animates it without partaking of its mortality. A being so formed, he observes, is the sport of maya, or illusion, which urges him to follow the dictates of passion rather than submit to the control of reason. It is a consciousness of this imbecility, that induces him to confess with shame and remorse at how early a period he felt the influence of those evil tendencies which he was unable to control; and he states his determination to go to some holy spot in order to\ndestroy his bad propensities, and acquire a disposition to rivet his affections in contemplating the Deity.\n\nIt was with this intention he withdrew from the world at the early age of seventeen, to Toka on the Godaveri, and in prosecution of the same object, that he accompanied the army to the north in order to obtain an opportunity of visiting the classic ground of the demi-god CRISHNA. There is a simplicity and a strain of elegance pervading this part of his history which is singularly beautiful. He visits every spot described in the legend of the tenth canto of the Bhagavat (in which is to be found the history of CRISHNA), with a fervour very uncommon in persons of his age. The reflections he makes on every object he sees, and the fancied renovation of health and spirits in the abode of the deity, together with the pious enthusiasm he devotes to the performance of every part of his pilgrimage, are more calculated to convey to one's mind the fervent zeal of one of the ancients visiting the ruins of Athens or Thebes, than the picture of a Hindu, to whom we are not disposed to allow the possession of the quality oftaste, which pervades the whole of NANA's narrative of this holy journey.\n\nFrom this task he is hurried into the field of battle, where his feelings evidently partake more of the man of sentiment than of the hero; and we cannot but admire the beautiful apostrophe the Brahmin boy makes on the vain reliance to be placed on the fidelity of courtiers or princes, who had so often pledged themselves to die with their leader, but who so abandoned him on the day of trial that it was never known how or where he fell. The dangers which attended NANA FARNEVIS personally when he fled from the field of battle, and the manner in which he escaped, are well described; and without being intended to produce effect (for scarcely any person knew of this little piece of autobiography before it fell into my hands) afford us a simple but lively representation of the scene, as well as of the domestic habits and customs of his countrymen.\n\nIn conclusion, I trust that this small specimen of the talents of NANA FARNEVIS will excite considerable curiosity; and I cannot help thinking that an account of his private life, which I contemplate publishing, will prove an interesting and valuable work.\nVIII. Secret Correspondence of the Court of the Peshwa, Madhu Rao, from the Year 1761 to 1772. Translated from the Original Mahratta Letters, by Lieut.-Colonel John Briggs, M.R.A.S.\n\nRead May 3, 1828.\n\nOn the last occasion on which we met, I was permitted by your indulgence to read a piece of autobiography of Nana Farnevis, one of the most eminent persons who have become familiarly known to us since our first connexion with India. I stated that a vast number of the private and confidential papers of that extraordinary personage had fallen into my hands previously to my quitting India; and that a small, but interesting portion of them, had been translated by me and brought to this country. These translations have been submitted to two or three of the most distinguished members of our Society; and they have been pleased to express a wish that some of them might be brought to the notice of the Society, and explained by a narrative of the circumstances that led to their being written. The letters commence with the public life of Nana Farnevis in 1761, and end with the fall of his power as minister to the Peshwa in 1796. They form valuable materials to elucidate his conduct during his long and arduous official career; but they are the more remarkable for the insight they afford us into the secret springs which seem to have regulated the behaviour of his illustrious master and sovereign Madhu Rao the Great, who, as I have before mentioned,* ascended the throne in his sixteenth, and died in his twenty-eighth year. The period of his reign was that which formed the character of Nana Farnevis, and the intercourse of these young persons is developed in a very interesting manner in the letters alluded to. The correspondence belongs as much to the biography of Nana as to that of Madhu Rao; and as I have it in contemplation at some future period, if my time permits, to write the life of Nana, I am perhaps detracting from the value of that work by the present essay. My desire to contribute to the interest of our meetings, and to the utility of our Society, has however induced me to comply with the wishes\n\n* Page 95.\nof those members who have suggested this mode of introducing the curious correspondence of which I am in possession to this institution, and to the literary world.\n\nI assume, that most of the members present have read the very excellent history of the Mahrattas, which has recently been published by Captain Grant Duff, late Resident at the court of Sat\u00e1ra; and I shall therefore not enlarge on the nature of the relations which subsisted between the Peshwa and the Raja of all the Mahrattas; but shall give a very succinct account of the political situation of those states when Madhu Rao the Great ascended the throne of the Peshwas.\n\nThe Muhammedan hosts, settled in Transoxiana and Persia, first approached the Nil\u00e1b (the upper part of the Indus) in the tenth century. They gradually spread themselves over Northern India, and established in Dehli a kingdom independent of the monarchy which had sent forth their lieutenants to conquest. Three centuries elapsed ere the Muhammedan arms penetrated to the south of the Nerbada; after which the lieutenants of the Dehli empire, in common with those of other parts, became independent; and at the period of the invasion of India in 1526 by B\u00e1ber (the first of the race we designate by the title of the Great Mogul), all India north of the Crishna river had been for the most part subjugated by the Moslem troops, and no fewer than thirteen independent Muhammedan sovereigns reigned over a population of fifty millions of Hindus. Time had been allowed for these dynasties to sink into the luxury and imbecility which usually belong to despotism in the third or fourth generation; and the energy of the Mogul emperors, each of whom felt himself bound to accomplish the subjugation of all the Muhammedan princes whose ancestors had once been the lieutenants of the state, enabled them gradually to subvert their power, and to re-unite the dismembered provinces of the empire in the time of Aurungzeb, the last efficient monarch of the Mogul race.\n\nAvailing himself of the circumstances of the times, Shahji, a Hindu officer of the Muhammedan kingdom of Bijapore, set the example of making conquests in the name of his master, but virtually retaining the power he obtained over the subjugated country in his own hands. The same line of conduct was more effectually adopted by his enterprising son, Sivaji, who established an independent sovereignty in Mah\u00e1dshtra, the country which we now call the Deccan. Shao, the grandson of Sivaji, giving way to the voluptuous habits which he had acquired in the court of Au-\nRUNGZEB (where he had remained for many years a state prisoner,) permitted his prime minister, denominated Peshwa, to become virtually the executive ruler of the state; and this officer held his vice-regal court at Poona. BALAJI the first, and BAJI RAO his son, the second Peshwa, had successively filled these offices, when BALAJI the second, the father of MADHU RAO the Great, succeeded to the dignity of his ancestors in the year 1740.\n\nBy this time the Mahratta ascendancy was so great in India, that while one of its armies had repelled a partial invasion of the Afghans near the Indus, a second levied tribute in Behar, and a third having besieged and taken possession of Trichinopoly,* carried its Muhammedan prince, CHUNDA SAHIB, a prisoner to Sat\u00e1ra, where he remained in confinement for more than seven years. A sum of twenty thousand rupees, being a share of the tribute derivable from the territory of Arcot, was assigned to the Peshwa BALAJI the second; heavy contributions had been imposed on the ruler of the Mysore at the very gates of his capital; while the whole of the country below the western mountains, conquered from the Portuguese at this period, was made over by the Raja of Sat\u00e1ra to his minister: and the occupation of Malwa was at the same time granted to BALAJI by the feeble emperor of Dehli, in order to induce the Mahrattas to furnish a body of four thousand horse to protect his throne.\n\nThe following substance of this grant, to be found in Captain Grant Duff's Mahratta history, affords a fair specimen of the duties imposed on the Peshwa:\n\n\"The dignity of the Shahzada's (prince's) deputy in Malwa, together with the income attached to that situation, having been conferred on you, proper arrangements must be made in that province, so as to afford the subjects paying revenue to government due favour and protection, and to punish all such as are evil-disposed and disaffected. You must prevent the use of intoxicating drugs and spirituous liquors, and must administer justice equally, so that the strong shall not oppress the weak, and that no species of violence be tolerated.\"\n\nThe Raja SHAO of Sat\u00e1ra had for many years been in a state of mental inbecility; this aberration of mind was produced, it was supposed, by the death of a favourite wife. During his lucid intervals he was advised to adopt a son, his own having died some time before the wife\n\n* 26th March 1741.\nalluded to. To this measure he at length acceded. A member of the family, not hitherto known to exist, was suddenly produced from obscurity; and on the death of Raja Shao (which happened shortly after) the prince was raised to the throne, and his palace became his prison to the day of his decease. The Peshwa Balaji was not the person who confined the prince in the first instance, but it was his aunt Tara Bhye, an ambitious and clever woman, who hoped by this measure to assume the reins of government, and to subvert the power acquired by the Peshwa. She was, however, caught in her own toils. Balaji resisted her authority in the name of the prince whom he affected to regard as his sovereign, but whose release out of the hands of his aunt he never attempted to effect. From that period till the subversion of the government of the Peshwas, ten years since, the existence of the Rajas of Satara has hardly been known, and their power has been virtually extinct.\n\nThe duty of occupying Malwa, and enforcing obedience to the royal grant, was consigned to two chiefs, Holkar and Sindia; and their descendants still hold that extensive territory, the revenues of which were then estimated at one hundred and fifty lacs of rupees, equal to about a million and a-half sterling.\n\nOne other point of the political relations of the Mahrattas with the Muhammedans seems necessary to explain the narrative which is about to follow. This is, the existence of a very formidable power of the latter nation in the Deccan. This state was the vice-regal government of Hyderabad, held for several years by the descendants of Nizam-ul-Mulk, called by us the Nizam. The Mahratta armies, in the course of their operations, either overran the districts of this neighbour, or by forbearance obtained security for their own country during the absence of their soldiers in other quarters; and something like a balance of power seems to have been mutually recognized as politic by the parties, which however did not preclude them from occasional contests on questions of local importance.\n\nDissensions either at the court of Poona or Hyderabad usually led to these wars; and an opportunity to support the claims of some exiled relative ever afforded a plea for interference which brought with it the ultimate prospect of aggrandizement. It is not necessary to go into the details of these wars: for the present suffice it to say, that the Peshwa's brother Raghunat'ha Rao, had been much employed in active military operations,\nand had greatly distinguished himself, while his cousin, Sad\u00e1s'iva Pant Bh\u0101o, was not his inferior in martial reputation.\n\nNor was the Peshwa himself inactive: in his contests with the Nizam, Bal\u0101j\u012b had compelled him to cede territory yielding twenty-five lacs of rupees; and in a campaign into Mysore, he reduced that government to the necessity of paying a sum of thirty-two lacs of rupees.\n\nIn the year 1759, Raghun\u0101\u1e6d'h Rao, the Peshwa's brother, returned to Poona from a successful campaign in Hindustan; but instead of bringing wealth to the coffers of the State, he lavished all the booty acquired, and had demands for the payment of his troops upon the public treasury. Sad\u00e1s'iva Rao, the Peshwa's cousin, who at this time conducted the civil administration of the government, reproached Raghun\u0101\u1e6d'h Rao with his profusion: the latter became incensed, and told Sad\u00e1s'iva Rao that on the next expedition he had better assume the military command. The cousins accordingly changed places; and Sad\u00e1s'iva Rao shortly after evinced additional martial talents in a campaign against the Nizam, in which he compelled him to cede in perpetuity territory yielding more than \u00a3630,000 of annual revenue.\n\nAt this time the crisis arrived when it was prudent to put forth the whole strength of the Mahratta power in opposing the encroachments of the Afghans upon the territory of Dehli. Accordingly the Peshwa, Bal\u0101j\u012b Rao, having left his brother Raghun\u0101\u1e6d'h Rao as regent at Poona, marched to the north accompanied by his cousin Sad\u00e1s'iva Rao, and his eldest son Wisw\u0101s Rao, the heir to his throne. The main body of the army, under the latter prince, moved on to Dehli, while the Peshwa had scarcely reached the Nerbada, when he heard of the fatal defeat of his army at Paniput, and the loss of his favourite son and of his cousin Sad\u00e1s'iva Rao. This event made so deep an impression on his mind, that the Peshwa's intellects became impaired; and he died in a state of mental derangement at Poona a few months afterwards, leaving two sons, Madhu Rao, aged sixteen, and N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47 Rao, aged nine years. The former was raised to his father's dignity; but his uncle Raghun\u0101\u1e6d'h Rao (who is known to Europeans by the name of Ragoba), retained in his hands the supremacy of the government, and denied to his nephew any share in the administration.\n\nThe loss of the battle of Paniput and its consequences, afforded to the Muhammedan government of Hydrabad a favourable opportunity to recover the territory ceded to the Mahrattas; and the Nizam did not allow it to escape. War was declared for this purpose, and the Regent Ragoba was\ncompelled to cede territory yielding \u00a327,000 of revenue to the enemy, to prevent the destruction of Poona, in the vicinity of which the Muhammadan army had arrived.*\n\nShortly after this peace, the young Peshwa accompanied his maternal uncle Tryambac Rao with an army to the south, to levy tribute in Mysore; and the following letter to his friend Nana Farnevis, who had remained in Poona, gives us some idea of his character:\n\n\"1st June 1762.\n\n\"The news here are, that we have succeeded in all our affairs, with the exception of that of Sera. There has been too little time to effect much; for the rains having set in, the Tumbhadra swelled, and we were prevented doing any thing against Seringapatam this campaign: but we have accomplished all our wishes on this side of that river. The Crishna has detained us here for two or three days; but the head-quarters have crossed, and the bazar (including camp-sutlers and followers) is gradually crossing also. I fear we shall however be detained for two days more: yet I am sanguine that we shall reach Poona by the 12th of June.\"\n\nDuring the young prince's campaign with his maternal uncle, he resolved to adopt a new line of conduct. His mother, Gopika Bhye, an able and ambitious woman, had long cherished enmity against her late husband's brother Ragoba, but more especially against his wife Anand\u00ed Bhye, who was more artful, and fully as ambitions as herself. The feeling of hostility which prevailed in the breast of the mother of the young Peshwa was carefully transfused by her into his own; and the late confidential intercourse which had subsisted between him and his mother's brother Tryambac Rao, decided him in declaring, on his return to Poona, his determination to have a share at least in the management of his own affairs. His uncle Ragoba, and Sakaram Bappu, the most efficient of the ministers, offended at his presumption, and conceiving that the public affairs could not be conducted without them, resigned their offices. Madhu Rao, however, with the utmost promptitude, formed a new administration, at the head of which was his mother's brother Tryambac Rao, while among his personal and confidential secretaries was his friend Nana Farnevis. Ragoba retired to Nasuk, and in a short time appeared at the head of an army of Mahrattas, assisted by the Nizam with a considerable body of his troops; in return for\n\n* December 1761.\nwhich assistance, the remainder of the cessions made by the Hydrabad state to the late Peshwa in 1760 were to be formally relinquished.\n\nIn this alarming state of his affairs, the young Peshwa marched to oppose his uncle Ragoba; but having learned what sacrifice the latter was about to make, and reflecting on the ascendancy which so unnatural a war must give to the Nizam, the hereditary enemy of the Mahrattas, he offered no resistance when the two armies met, but threw himself into his uncle's power, by whom he was retained as a state prisoner, and Ragoba reassumed all the functions of head of the Mahrattas. The consequences of this revolution soon became apparent. The personal adherents and friends of the young Peshwa were dismissed, and some of them imprisoned and disgraced; measures which gave great umbrage to a very powerful party inimical to the regent. In addition to this, Ragoba now hesitated to fulfil the engagements which he had made with the Nizam, who immediately prepared for war. The Mahrattas also took the field; but avoiding an action with the enemy, plundered the Nizam's territories. Many of the partizans of the young Peshwa joined the Nizam, who, emboldened by this circumstance, penetrated to Poona, and not only sacked, but burned that town. This imprudent step created much disaffection among his Mahratta partizans, who received secret communications from the young Peshwa to return to the cause of their country, without regard to his condition. Meanwhile the Mahratta army burned the suburbs of Hydrabad, and having approached the Nizam's army, harassed it by skirmishes, without venturing on a general engagement.\n\nThe war had become so unpopular with the Mahratta chiefs allied with the Nizam, that placing little reliance on them, that prince was induced to retire towards Aurungabad. On reaching Rakisbori, a town on the banks of the Godaveri, the Muhammedan head-quarters and part of the cavalry had already crossed when the army of Ragoba appeared in sight. He was too experienced a general not to perceive his advantage, and he instantly engaged that portion of the enemy which was still on the south bank. A desperate conflict ensued; the regent Ragoba's troops fell back; and his own elephant being surrounded by the enemy, he was a prisoner in their hands. His gallant nephew, regardless of the injuries he had sustained, and of all personal advantages which must have accrued to him on the death or captivity of his uncle, addressed the corps of one hundred cavalry which formed his guard, and persuaded them to follow him in effecting the\nregent's release. This band, animated with the same spirit which fired the bosom of the young hero, charged the body of the enemy into whose hands their prince had fallen, and the young Peshwa not only rescued his uncle, but turned the fate of the day, and obtained a complete victory, on which occasion the Nizam's prime minister and generalissimo fell. An account of this battle, which took place on the 11th August 1762, written by Madhu Rao to Nana Farnevis, is still in existence, and affords a good sample of the vigorous style of the young Peshwa, then in his nineteenth year; but, consistently with the modesty which usually belongs to such minds, he makes no mention whatever of his own share in the transaction.\n\nLetter from Madhu Rao to Nana Farnevis.\n\n\"Nizam Ali Khan marched on Rakisbori with his whole army, to cross the Godaveri. He himself, with eight hundred Patan cavalry, had already gained the north bank; the remainder, being about four thousand men, composed of cavalry, infantry, and guns, under Vitala Sunder and Vinayak Das, were still on the south bank on the 28th of Mohram (11th August). In this situation, after a march of eight coss (sixteen miles), our light troops suddenly came upon the enemy, who drew up to receive us. An action ensued, which lasted four ghatikas (about an hour and a-half). The enemy behaved with great spirit, but was defeated. Vitala Sunder's head was cut off. Vinayak Dass's body was also found among the slain, besides several other officers who were killed. About three hundred Patans were left dead on the field. Morad Khan and some officers of distinction have been made prisoners. A portion fled and escaped; but of those who attempted to swim the river many were drowned. The enemy's camp equipage has all fallen into our hands. Twenty guns, besides magazines of powder, rockets, balls and lead, have also been captured, as well as fifteen elephants.\n\nOn our part, Madhaji Nayac Nimbalker and Culaji Rao Patankur were killed; in addition to some other chiefs. We have also a long list of wounded, but by the favour of God we gained the victory. Bihosla has joined.\"\n\nThe last three words conveyed to his correspondent the most important information of all. This chief was the Raja of Nagpore, who, with a con-\n\n* The generalissimo.\nsiderable body of troops had taken part with the Nizam against the regent Ragoba; but on discovering the active part the young Peshwa had taken, and owing to the private overtures made to him, he had joined the Mahrattas, and contributed mainly to effect the reconciliation which was subsequently brought about between the uncle and nephew.\n\nThe following letter, written by Moro Babu Rao, the cousin of Nana, to the latter, gives a very full explanation of the state of affairs.\n\n\"South bank of the Godaveri, 22d August 1763.\n\n\"It is some time since I heard from you: I beg of you always to patronize me by your correspondence. I wrote to you from Aurungabad, and also sent one or two letters afterwards, which I trust have been received. I got one letter from you which contained no news; and I am still in ignorance where you now are, or what you are about. With regard to us, we were in the Naw\u00e1b's (Nizam's) camp with Bhosla and the rest of the chiefs. Meanwhile his Highness (Ragoba), accompanied by Bes\u00e1let Jeng (the Nizam's brother), came into the neighbourhood of our (the Nizam's) camp. At this time his Highness Ragoba's troops were in great consternation. On our part the Mahratta auxiliaries were numerous and formidable. His Highness Ragoba's affairs were desperate, for if he had been defeated by the Muhammedans, the Hindu government might have been subverted. Taking this circumstance into our consideration, Gopal Rao (the chief of Mirch), and others of the Poona party, made efforts to gain over Bhosla, and to induce him to desert the Nizam. Overtures had been made to us through his Highness (Madhu Rao) for more than a month, when we at length deputed Ramaji Belal and Hari U'maj\u00ed to proceed to his Highness Ragoba's camp, and to make terms for us all. His Highness, however, could not be brought to confide in our promises, and he hesitated in attacking the Nizam's army, owing to its strength, but marched to Ahmednagar. Bhosla was now gained over, and he resolved not to accompany the Moguls beyond the Godaveri. We also took measures for breaking with the Nizam; and Gopal Rao accordingly demanded some forts to be given into our hands, in order to have places of safety for our families. This request not being acceded to, afforded us a plea to quit the Moguls in disgust. I, with many others, went to Mungulwehra.* The instant we reached home (that is the\n\n*A town near Punderpore, on the Bhima.\n\"Mahratta territory), his Highness Ragoba sent Naro Sankar Raja Behadur to us with ample promises; we accordingly left the place of our retreat on the 11th of August,* and reached this camp on the 20th instant. We were met at some distance by both their Highnesses (Ragoba and the young Peshwa), who told me they had written to you, and expected you here immediately.\n\nHaving entered into this detail, that you may know the state of affairs, let me hear from you; and intimate when we may expect you. I propose taking leave in a day or two to proceed and visit my father at Devagirry (Dowlutabad). Bhosla is with us, and encamped near to us.\n\nThe Nawaub (Nizam) got safely across the river. Vitala Sunder, with three or four thousand Moguls, was still on the south bank when he was attacked by his Highness. Vitala Sunder behaved most gallantly; the battle raged for an hour and a-half with great fury. His Highness Ragoba was obliged to fall back half a coss (a mile). The enemy pushed him vigorously; for although the Mahrattas were the most numerous, they had no guns nor rockets. The action was brought to short weapons, and at length God favoured his Highness, who was saved and gained the victory. Vitala Sunder, Vinayik Das, the Raja of Kundhar, with other chiefs, fell in the field.\n\nHis Highness says he is very desirous you and I should be in camp together. I am here already, and you are expected, so make haste and come.\"\n\nPostscript in the hand-writing of Moro Bulal Putwardhien:\u2014\"All the Putwardhens send their compliments.\"\n\nA partial reconciliation having been effected between the Peshwa and his uncle Ragoba, and the most respectable chiefs having sided with the former, Madhu Rao felt himself at liberty to proceed with his army to the south and renew the campaign against Mysore, while his uncle was to be left in charge of the civil administration at Poona. This arrangement met the concurrence of all the ministers; and the Peshwa departed. An incident however occurred, about this time, which rendered it necessary for him to alter his plans; and it sets the characters of the young Peshwa and that of his uncle in their true light. Ragoba, though ambitious, was naturally generous; and though he could not part with his power, he admired the amiable and\n\n* The very day of the battle.\nmanly conduct of his nephew, who even at this early age seems to have penetrated deeply into his uncle's character.\n\nThe Peshwa's army had arrived in the neighbourhood of Wa\u00ed, when he learned by an express messenger that his uncle was raising troops and that he meditated an insurrection to effect his seizure. The measures which the Peshwa took on this occasion were as prompt as judicious. The persons on whose assistance Ragoba chiefly relied had not yet reached Poona; no overt steps had been taken, but the plot was certain, and the instruments might soon be expected. The Peshwa was aware that his own party in Poona was at present strong, and that no troops had yet been raised by his uncle; he accordingly directed a considerable body of cavalry to return by the high road to the capital, while he, mounting a favourite mare, and with only one attendant, proceeded across the mountains, and reached the palace unexpectedly at daylight next morning. He sprang from his horse and ran through the apartments (unarmed as he was), till he reached his uncle's presence. Ragoba, equally surprised and mortified at this sudden appearance of his nephew, feigned great gratification, and asked the cause. A few moments served the Peshwa to explain himself: \"I am no sooner absent than your Highness, I hear, has ordered troops to be raised, which I learn are to be employed against me. This is quite unnecessary. I have left my army, and am come alone and unarmed to submit to your will, rather than be the cause of dissensions among my countrymen.\" Ragoba is said to have melted into tears at the contemplation of so much generosity, and to have clasped his nephew in his arms. The day passed in professions of regard on the part of Ragoba; and during the night the arrival of the Peshwa's troops placed him in a situation to enable him to make more satisfactory arrangements for the management of his affairs during his absence.\n\nSakaram Bappu, the most able minister of the state, was, on the whole, favourable to Ragoba, for which reason the Peshwa insisted on his accompanying his army to the south, thus ensuring at the same time the use of his talents, and separating him from his uncle. The Dowager Gopika Bhye, and her son Narayan Rao, remained in Poona; and Nana Farnevis was left in charge of the government; while Ragoba and his wife Anandi Bhye retired in much disgust to Anandivilli, where they had a palace on the Godaveri, near the town of Nasuk.\n\nThe military ardour of the young Peshwa prompted him to take the field\nin person against Hyder, who had now usurped the whole power of the Mysore state; but Madhu Rao's mind was full of anxiety for his domestic interests, as appears from the letters he wrote about this time to his deputy Nana Farnevis.\n\nFrom Madhu Rao Peshwa to Nana.\n\n\"Camp, 17th March 1764.\n\n\"I have received your letter, stating that my venerable mother is gone to Tryambac, and that she has left my brother Narayan Rao at Poona.\n\n\"I have also received a list of the losses sustained through the fire, which shall be taken into consideration and replied to at a future period; meanwhile, let me know where my uncle (Ragoba) is at present. Mulhar Rao Holkar has seen him, accompanied by his minister; and you must ascertain and let me know what passed between them, and what they intend doing.\"\n\nAgain, on the 23d March 1764, he writes to Nana Farnevis:\n\n\"Your letters are not sufficiently in detail. Let me know where my uncle (Ragoba) is, how he is, what he is doing, and what are his future plans. Have you not the means of ascertaining all these facts fully? I should like to know what accounts he gets from my camp, and what he says of them. Mulharba (Mulhar Rao Holkar) certainly met my uncle; but I did not hear what passed. You must ascertain the particulars, and let me know. Write also all you hear regarding him.\n\n\"Where does my mother mean to fix her residence? Ascertain what passed between her and my uncle. I hear my mother's brother also visited her at Poona. Let me know, if you can, what occurred on the occasion.\"\n\nThe delay caused by the necessity of the Peshwa's return to Poona, as has been stated, had prevented his making much progress in the war before the rains commenced in June, when he was obliged to put his army into quarters at some distance north of Dharwar. His uncle, who had at first retired towards Nasuk in disgust, now resolved to join his nephew, and giving orders for the equipment of a formidable army, gave out that he intended to march to the southern frontier, a measure by no means agreeable to the Peshwa, but which the latter could not directly oppose. The letters which Madhu Rao wrote to Nana on the subject of his uncle's equipments at this time, are important, and shew considerable talent in so young a person.\nOfficial, in the hand-writing of the Secretary Hari Pant:\n\n\"12th of August 1764.\n\n\"Your letter of the 21st of July was duly received on the 10th of August,\nstating, that you had received his Highness my uncle's orders to farm\nthe revenues of the districts for the next year, and that you are accord-\ningly doing so: that his Highness had gone to Tryambac: that two lacs\n(\u00a320,000) had been fixed for the artillery equipments; and that when the\ninstalments payable next month are received, you will send me a lac\nand a-half of rupees (\u00a315,000). You observe, that money may be expected\nimmediately from the revenues remittable by Sindia and the Gaikwar. Out\nof this, 'five lacs are required for the garrisons; half of the balance has\nbeen allotted for his Highness (my uncle's) equipments; and the other\nhalf is to be sent to the Carnatic.' According to this statement, nothing\nremains over; but you say you will do all you can to meet my wants here.\nNow that you have got the management of the revenue department, I\nhave no doubt you will contrive to raise something more than usual on\naccount of government: of this I rest satisfied. By your account, the\nexpenses of the new artillery establishment, and of the troops raising by\nmy uncle, will be enormous. I should think so many guns quite unnec-\nessary; nor ought such a number of new troops to be raised. I have\nwritten to him two or three times on this subject; but I wish you to take\na favourable opportunity of impressing it on his mind. The enemy is\nnot to be defeated merely by a large park of artillery. My uncle has\nalready twenty guns with him. If they are properly equipped in every\nrespect, they should be sufficient. Still, if his mind is set on having\nmore guns, he must be indulged. Last year, when I left Poona, the\nsum of a lac and a-half of rupees was considered enough for my twenty\nguns; the estimates will be found in the arsenal. You had better carry\nthem to my uncle, and shew them to him.\n\n\"One word for all. Do not allow the expenses there (Poona) to be too\nlarge. I am always writing on this subject, and I beg of you constantly to\nremind my uncle of it. Our expenses here must necessarily be great.\nThe household troops have only received half their field allowances for\nlast year, so that half is still due to them, independent of what is to\nbe paid for this year. These are exclusive of payments to the artillery,\nand in compensation for horses killed in action. So, you see, the more\nmoney you can send here the better. I conclude, that the lac and a-half of\n\nVol. II.\ncash mentioned in your letter has been despatched ere this time. Bills have been drawn on you for 75,000 rupees, which I beg, after communicating with my uncle, may be paid as they fall due; if any difficulty should be made, I shall lose my character. The money has been already advanced to us by the bankers in this quarter, so it is of the utmost importance to the credit of our camp-bankers that the money should be paid punctually, under any circumstances. This sum must not be deducted from that which you are sending to me. If it is true, as I hear, that some balances are due to the farmers of revenue of last year, it must be ascribed to the consequences of the war in this quarter. You must persuade them not to urge for repayment just now; but, if you can, endeavour to raise a loan from them, and at all events induce them to pay their future instalments punctually.\"\n\nThe following is another letter of the same date, written in Madhu Rao's own hand:\n\n\"12th of August 1764.\n\n\"The following is the state of affairs in this quarter:\u2014Hyder Naic is now in Hungul; his troops are much dispirited, and quit him daily, particularly his infantry. He has at present from ten to twelve thousand regular infantry, besides about two or three thousand cavalry. It is on his regular infantry and guns he places his whole dependence; his cavalry will not remain long with him, and those in his camp at present are preparing to come over to me. With regard to my own troops, we are principally in want of supplies; provisions are dear, and a great deal of distress prevails. Forage, however, is still abundant. The cash you mentioned is not yet come. Pray let us have it quickly; it is impossible to say how much it is wanted.\"\n\nOther letters, dated the 21st and 22d of August; and the 3d, 5th, and 15th of September, are all in the same strain; want of money, and the necessity for limiting the military equipments of Ragoba at Poona.\n\nOn the 27th of September 1764, Madhu Rao writes to Nana Farnevis in his own hand:\n\n\"I have received your letter, and read it with great attention, particularly the part regarding Purandhar, and that stating the negociations to be in the hands of Tryambac Rao Marna.\n\n\"You write that my uncle has been unwell. Let me hear how he is at present, and when he intends coming to this quarter.\"\nAgain, on the same day:\n\n\"Ascertain what is the nature of the correspondence my uncle has lately opened with the Nizam, and who are the people employed in this business.\"\n\nAs a proof of the influence the females had at the court of Poona, and of the deference paid to them, the following letter is introduced:\n\nOn the 1st of June 1764, Madhu Rao writes: \"My aunt Parwat\u00ed Bhye (the widow of Bhao Sahib, who commanded the army and lost his life at Paniput) complains of want of courtesy from you. By all means indulge her whims, and keep her in good humour; do not give room to her to complain again.\"\n\nThis line of conduct was accordingly adopted; but the result is apparent from the following letter, dated the 6th of October 1764:\n\n\"I understand that Parwat\u00ed Bhye has procured some of the jewels to be sent to her from Sirgur. Enquire if this be the case; and if so, procure them to be sent back into the fort without mentioning it to my uncle Ragoba. Let this be done at once.\n\n\"When I came away I told both you and Naro Pant not to allow any of those jewels to be removed without asking me. How is it then, when I spoke so plainly on this subject, that this has occurred? You can tell my aunt (Parwat\u00ed Bhye) quietly, that 'you did not like to prevent her having the jewels to look at when she wanted them, for fear of giving her offence, but that you now beg her to send them back, for if I hear it I shall be very angry with you.' Make this excuse to her, and get the jewels back. Do not let any body see this letter. This is the method of managing my aunt, so as to have the jewels back into the fort.\"\n\nIn the month of December 1764, Ragoba, having finished his field equipments, proceeded to join his nephew, whose military operations against Hyder, according to the historians of that time, Grant Duff and Colonel Wilks, were eminently successful. This youthful chieftain had driven the enemy's troops before him in all directions, and compelled Hyder to fall back, with his army dispersed, excepting two thousand five hundred horse and ten thousand infantry and guns; and he was reduced to such extremities as to open a negociation through Ragoba, who had just reached his nephew's camp. Madhu Rao gave up the whole of the negociation to his uncle, who effected a peace on terms which Colonel\nWilks, the historian of Hyder, observes,* were extremely moderate, considering the desperate circumstances in which Hyder stood. In a note, Colonel Wilks states, \"Naro Sanker (Raja Bahadur) was the person sent by Ragoba to Hyder for the final adjustment of the terms; and among them were, without question, some secret articles which were the foundation of that good understanding which ever afterwards subsisted between Hyder and Raghunath Rao (Ragoba).\"\n\nThe young Peshwa was not deceived in the nature of this transaction; but having given his uncle full powers to treat, he had the honour to confirm the treaty, though he expressed his dissatisfaction in plain terms. Hyder paid \u00a3320,000 to the Mahrattas in February 1765; and their army retired to Poona.\n\nThese events only tended to create additional mistrust of his uncle on the part of the Peshwa, and dislike of the latter in the mind of Ragoba.\n\nThe year 1765 was spent in enforcing payment of some tribute from the Raja of Nagpore; and in the latter end of the same year, in spite of the intrigues he had been carrying on throughout that period, Ragoba obtained leave to assume the command of an army to proceed to Malwa.\n\nThe absence of the Mahratta troops from the southern frontier seems at this period to have incited Hyder to attack the territories of the Mahrattas and the Nizam, who formed a coalition against the chief of Mysore, in which the English were to join.\n\nAs a sample of the method of conducting his business, the following memorandum, dated 1767, in Madhu Rao's own hand, and left with Nana Farnevis, is given; it was found among the papers of the latter, and is curious:\n\n\"Done. 1.

BHUKAJ\u00cd NAYAC KOLUBKUR (a near connexion) has been entrusted with the arrangements\n\"for it; so pray comply with any requisition he may make of you to complete it.\n\n\"Tear this letter.\"\n\nThe pleasure-house, situated in the midst of a beautiful cypress garden on a handsome lake in the skirts of the town of Poona, is still standing, and is known by the appellation of the Hira Bagh (the diamond garden). It forms one of the most picturesque objects of the place, and has frequently employed the pencils of the European amateur artists of both sexes since we took possession of the country in 1818.\n\nThe same subject is alluded to in another letter, dated the 26th of March:\n\n\"You will learn all the news from the accompanying letters. Do you never go to see how my new garden and pleasure-house are going on? What sort of a place are they making of it? How far is it advanced? Write me all the particulars. Do you find my agent zealous in the undertaking, or does he throw obstacles in the progress of the work? Let me hear also every little particular you can learn regarding Anandivalli (the residence of his uncle's wife and family). Write these with your own hand, without letting any one see the letter.\n\n\"I wish you would have the female apartments over the terrace of the new pleasure-house prettily painted, so that they may be worth looking at. This is a point I leave entirely to your own taste. You can let me know what is your opinion on this subject.\"\n\n\"Tear this letter.\"\n\nIn another letter, dated the 6th of September 1767, Madhu Rao mentions having sent some very fine muslin, which he begs may be worked in gold for his lady; with the usual injunction of destroying the order.\n\nThe following military letters, written by a youth of twenty-one, are spirited, and mark the character of the writer:\n\nMadhu Rao, in his own hand, to Nana Farnevis and Govind Sivarani, dated the 6th of March 1766.\n\n\"The news in this quarter are that the fort of Mudgiri has fallen. It is a very nice place, resembling Dowlutabad. It was very unlikely to be carried by storm, but God so ordered it. This is the truth, for no one looking at it would say it could be taken in the way it was. It is certainly very strong. It is close to Sera. Hyder Naic is at Puttan (Seringapatam), from whence he has sent an agent to treat for peace, but we have\n\"come to no terms. I shall continue my march on Kolar and Oscotta.\n\n\"We are fast recovering the districts taken from Morari Rao.

We in-\nstantly attacked and defeated them, taking five or six guns. There were\ntwo others that the enemy threw into the ditch, which we shall soon\nhave also. Of the guns captured on this occasion two are beautiful\nfield pieces, better by far than any we have in our arsenal. We have\nestablished ourselves on the same spot the enemy occupied, and also on\nthe crest of the glacis, where our trenches are now being formed; and,\nthe batteries once opened, we shall, by the blessing of God, soon have\nthe place.\n\nLet me hear from you, what you are all about.\"\n\nAgain:\n\n\"The fort of Sera has fallen. I wrote that we first defeated Mir\nHyder, who was encamped on the outside, and took his guns. In\nshort, by the favour of God, much has been accomplished in a short\nspace of time. The Mir (Mir Hyder) has engaged to enter the\nMahratta service. He is to have a jagir (an estate), yielding five lacs\nannually. He has been negotiating some days for the surrender of the\nplace; and having given it up, has now consented also to take the jagir.\nThe districts lately placed under his control are to be occupied by our\nown people; and he is to serve with our head-quarters. He has consented\nto send for his family, which is to reside at Poona. His jagir is to\nconsist of districts, half in this part of the country and half near\nPoona.\"\n\n\"16th April 1767.\n\n\"The fort of Oscotta has fallen. It is a strong place. This, with other\ndistricts occupied, yield an annual revenue of twenty-five lacs of rupees.\nThe Mir has recovered also the districts which our government\nformerly held in the vicinity of Gurumconda. The territory yielding\nfive lacs, held originally by Morari Rao, with all his forts, has also\nfallen to our troops again; so that Jugdiu is now the only Mahratta\ndistrict which we have not got back again.\"\n\"Hitherto we have been solely occupied in military operations, securing\nthe country; but not one rupee of cash has been raised on it. The\ntribute due from Harponelly and other places, however, has been realized,\nand I have obtained eight or nine lacs of rupees more by bills. The\nmain objects of the war have been nearly accomplished, and very little\nremains to be done. Hyder Khan, however, still possesses his own\noriginal country untouched.\n\nWith regard to our future operations, this is the state of the case. It\nwas originally agreed on, that the Nawab Nizam Ali Khan should march\nand co-operate with our troops. He still writes he is coming, coming.\nThis is in the true Mogul style, ever slow and lazy to the last. I have\nrecovered for him Banu and other places belonging to Besalet Jeng,\nwho from being formerly connected with Hyder, and being at present in\nthe Nizam's camp, favours the enemy by throwing obstacles in the\nadvance of the Nizam's army, and by endeavouring to persuade his\nbrother, that more will be attained by negotiating than by fighting. The\nNizam however has actually left Raidr\u00fag, and is I believe advancing at\nlast. Were it not for Rukm-ud-Dowla (who is an excellent person) all\nour affairs in that quarter would go wrong. We must contrive to keep\nhim on our side and in good-humour, and entrust all our concerns to him\nalone. Had the Nizam co-operated with us at first, we should have con-\ncluded the business before this time. Had he even declined to do so, we\ncould have continued our own operations without reference to him; but\nas it is, we are hampered owing to the delay. There is no probability of\nthe Nizam uniting with Hyder against us; but the latter, calculating that\nboth our armies will not remain here during the monsoon, seems hanging\nback to see with whom he may negotiate with most advantage in the end.\nHe has promised to pay the peshkush (a sum of money) to the Nizam, on\ncondition of his breaking off his alliance with us; and to me he engages to\npay down thirty lacs of rupees if we relinquish the territory we have\nrecovered; but the forts we have taken are strong, and if they are given\nup, we shall not take them again so easily. Of these, some are hill-forts,\nwhich we must not relinquish. This is the point for which I am at present\ncontending. Hyder is aware that the Nizam is advancing, and has some\napprehension on that score; still I do not think peace is likely to be con-\ncluded immediately. If Hyder is to be farther reduced, we must take\nBangalore, and even advance on Seringapatam. At all events we must\n\"now carry the thing through; yet, as the rains are so near, the time will\nhardly admit of our attempting both objects at present. Meanwhile you\nmust contrive to raise twenty-five lacs of rupees for our necessities; for,\neven should peace be concluded, the payments of cash will only be made\nby instalments, and we want twenty-five lacs as soon as possible. I\npropose leaving Gopal Rao Rastia with fifteen thousand men in this\nquarter, to maintain the impression already made, and to preserve the\nplaces we have occupied. The twenty-five lacs of rupees, however, must\nbe supplied by you, although it would certainly have been more convenient\nif we could have reduced Bangalore, and compelled Hyder to pay the\nexpenses of the war at once.\"\n\nThe following treaty was concluded a few days afterwards, and is in the\nhandwriting of Hari Pant Farkia, the officer who subsequently com-\nmanded the Mahratta army, which joined the Marquess Cornwallis in 1792,\nat Bangalore:\n\n\"Memorandum: Money payments.\n\n\"Tribute; net..............................................

The Nizam is to receive the arrears of peshkush (tribute) for\nthe last three years, viz. Rupees 18,00,000 (\u00a3180,000), at the rate of six\nlacs of rupees annually; credit being given by him for what he may have\nalready received. The remainder is to be paid as follows: half to be paid\ndown at once; the balance in six months from this date.\n\n\"Article 7th. The Srirangi temples are to be supported, and the Sewani (or\nreligious superior) is not to be molested in any way, whether he go there\nor not.\n\n\"Article 8th.

Hyder Ali Khan promises to cause to be regularly paid\nall charitable and religious stipends to Brahmans and temples within his\nown territory, according to established usage, and not to molest the\nHindus on account of their religion.\n\n\"Presents are to be mutually interchanged through the agency of the\nrespective ambassadors after the ratification of this treaty.\"\n\nThe allies now retired to their capitals: but it is remarkable, that, in the\nwhole of these letters, no allusion is once made to the English, although it is said by our historians that they were included in the offensive alliance against Hyder.\n\nIt will be recollected, that, after the campaign against the Raja of Nagpore in 1766, and previously to the coalition of the Peshwa and the Nizam in 1767 against Hyder, Ragoba had obtained the command of a separate army, with which he proceeded to Malwa, accompanied by Mulhar Rao Holkar, a chief with whom it has been shewn he maintained a close and friendly intercourse. What were his ultimate views, did not at first appear; and at all events they were for the present obstructed by the death of Mulhar Rao, and the accession of a silly young prince, his grandson, Malli Rao, who did not long survive his predecessor, but died in March 1767, leaving no heirs. At his death his mother, the celebrated Ahilya Bhye, became the sole representative of the family. Holkar's minister Gangadhar Yeswant made interest with Ragoba, then on the spot, to procure a child to be adopted as Holkar's heir, a measure which was resisted by the Dowager Ahilya Bhye. The correspondence of this year commences, however, before these events, but leads on to them.\n\nMadhu Rao to Nana Farnevis, in his own hand.\n\n\"6th of January 1767.\n\n\"I received your letter enclosing that from Baji Govind. I am very anxious for news from that quarter (Malwa). You must write to Baji Govind therefore to let me hear constantly every thing that occurs, but in such a manner as to prevent a certain person knowing that he communicates with us at all.\n\n\"Let me hear what has been the result of the orders to the commanders of the garrisons and to the district officers: also how his (Ragoba's) officers are disposed towards him: how he is satisfied with them, and how he treats them: the same with respect to his ministers and men of business.\n\n\"Who is the minister at present, and who possesses his confidence most? In what direction are his next movements to carry him? What are his ultimate views, and what his present intentions? Does he talk of returning to this quarter? Let Baji Pant ascertain all these points minutely; and let me hear very frequently. Write to Baji Pant, and tell him to send his communications through you.\"\n\nS2\nFrom the same to the same.\n\n\"9th of March 1767.\n\n\"I hear that Gopal Gurish Bharvi is to be deputed on a secret mission to the Nizam by Anand\u00ed Bhye (Ragoba's wife) from Nasuk. Look to this, and endeavour to intercept him, and secure any papers he may have.\"\n\nThe following extract of a letter from the same to the same is on the subject of Ragoba's movements:\n\n\"26th of March 1767.\n\n\"I wish you to procure more complete information of my uncle's movements and intentions, through Baji Pant. I hear he has two plans: the one is, to come back to Anandivalli (where his wife resides); and the other, to return to Poona. I will let you know, when I hear for certain, on which he resolves. Do not let any body know the contents of this letter, but tear it after perusal.\"\n\nFrom the same to the same.\n\n\"I hear that my uncle Dada Sahib is coming instantly to the Deccan, from Hindustan. I wrote to you before to desire Govind Sivaram (one of the ministers at Poona) to meet him; but I have reports that some of Hyder's sailors have landed on the coast, and are plundering in the Concan. If this be true, I shall not be satisfied unless Govind Sivaram goes as far as Vidyadurg, and makes every thing secure in that quarter. Yet, in case my uncle is coming immediately from Hindustan, he must go and meet him in preference. The question therefore now rests on the immediate approach of my uncle. If he should have reached the Ner-budda river already, on his way south, let Govind Sivaram be instantly despatched to his camp; but if not, let him go to the Concan. Explain my wishes to Govind Sivaram, and let me know what takes place. I enclose a short letter for him, which you can deliver.\n\nFrom the same to the same.\n\n\"22d of April 1767.\n\n\"I hear that one Babu Rao Sadasiwa is in the habit of writing confidential letters, reporting every thing to my uncle. It is necessary to take precautions on this subject, and if possible, to intercept some of the correspondence. I understand Babu Rao resides at present at Toka (a town on the Godaveri, a hundred miles north of Poona), and I forward\n\"to you a letter from Dev\u00e1nda Madhu of Dowlutabad, which will give you\nevery information necessary to enable you to act in this conjuncture of affairs.\nLet Govind Sivaram also be informed of this channel of communication.\"\n\nFrom the same to the same.\n\n\"25th of April 1767.\n\n\"I must have more frequent information relating to my uncle. I have\ntherefore sent Jot\u00ed Crishna from hence to Burhanpur, and attached\nseveral camel messengers to him, by whom he will send me news daily.\nI beg of you also to write all that you may hear. I formerly wrote to\nyou to send Govind Sivaram to my uncle, and I conclude he is gone;\nif not, let him go forthwith.\n\nFrom the same to the same.\n\n\"I do not hear now of what my uncle is doing. I write to you con-\nstantly on this subject, but you do not manage the intelligence depart-\nment well. Have a post established for the purpose, so as to admit of\nmy hearing constantly. Have the post established even from beyond\nBurhanpur. I trust Govind Sivaram has left Poona long ago; if not,\nyou have managed famously, truly! You know I have written frequently\nthat he might go; but as yet I have no intimation of his having actually\ngone. Surely this is very strange.\"\n\nThe following letter from Dadoba Wagol\u00edkar, the Peshwa's agent at\nIndur, to Nana Farnev\u00eds, shews the state of affairs at Malwa. The original\nletter having been forwarded to Madhu Rao in camp, the copy extant is\nin Nana Farnev\u00eds's hand-writing:\n\nFrom Dada Wagol\u00edkar to Nana Farnev\u00eds.\n\n\"22d of March 1767.\n\n\"His Highness Madhu Rao sent me to reside here; but the chief\n(Mall\u00ed Rao Holkar) died on the 10th of March. Both his widows went\nwith him (burned with his corpse).\n\n\"The Dowager Ahilya Bhye alone is left. The estates are large. She\ntalks of retiring to Benares. The minister, Gang\u00e1dh\u00e1r Yeswant is here,\nbut his son Dadaj\u00ed Gang\u00e1dh\u00e1r is with his Highness Ragoba Dada in\nthis quarter. The minister's son writes, that as his Highness intends to\nresume the estates, the dowager and the minister ought immediately to\ngo to his Highness's camp, and make up their minds to pay him a large\nfine to be allowed to hold them.\"\n\"He urges this step very strongly, and assures his father that he will take care to prevent any opposition to the continuation of the estates from the other quarter (meaning on the part of the Peshwa). Dadaji Gangadhar writes to his father to rely entirely on the interest at his Highness Ragoba's head-quarters. Such is the nature of the letter written by the minister's son. It is clear therefore that their views are to settle the affair here, and only to keep up appearances with you.\n\n\"For myself, you know I am but a humble individual, and merely represent this for the information of his Highness the Peshwa. I have no one to look to but yourself, whose influence with his Highness is notoriously greater than that of any one beside. Pray write to him, and forward this letter to him. I could not venture to send it the whole distance to his camp, for fear of its miscarrying, so I beg of you to despatch it by an active camel messenger by express.\n\n\"Such were my orders, and I was directed to communicate them to no one but yourself. I enjoin you by the most sacred oaths, not to reveal what I have written.\n\n\"I hope your Excellency will not be offended at the liberty I take when I suggest that Holkar's estates in the Deccan may be resumed for the present; this measure will, I think, promote the good of his Highness Madhu Rao's affairs. If you cannot venture on such a step yourself, you might wait till you receive an answer, when there will be no responsibility with you, and you can have nothing to be apprehensive of.\n\n\"Send on this letter quickly. I have done my duty: the rest remains with you.\"\n\nThis letter must have reached Madhu Rao about the time of his forming the treaty with Hyder, and in the midst of other important business. His agent at Indur had formerly written to him, that he might under any circumstances rely on Holkar's minister Gangadhar Yeswant, and his son, as being attached to his interests in preference to those of his uncle; but the object of the minister in effecting the adoption of an infant through Ragoba's power in Malwa, and thus securing to himself the sole administration of the Holkar estate, seems to have made him change his party.\n\nThe reply to the letter of Nana Farnevis, forwarding the foregoing document, conveys a good idea of the deliberation the young Peshwa observed in his conduct towards the chief families of the state.\nFrom Madhu Rao, in his own hand, to Nana Farnevis.\n\n\"I have received your letter, enclosing that of Dadoba Wagol\u00edkar.\n\n\"We must not resume any of the Holkar estates in the Deccan at present, for many reasons. In the first place, if we were to incur the expense, we ought to be reimbursed in ten or twelve lacs of rupees at least; but as the season for making the collections is over, we shall obtain nothing: secondly, the measure will give great offence to my uncle, who will conclude it is done because the Holkars negotiated with him: thirdly, Gangoba (Gang\u00e1dihar Yeswant, Holkar's minister) will immediately conclude that I am personally hostile to him and the Holkars, which will decide him in throwing himself at once into my uncle's arms. These are the motives which induce me not to resume the lands in the Deccan.\n\n\"Were ten or twenty lacs of rupees to be gained, we might overlook the obstacles I mention; that not being the case, and there being no advantage equivalent to the inconvenience arising out of the measure, I did not think it necessary to reply to your letter before.\n\n\"In answer to Dadoba Wagol\u00edkar, you need assign no reasons, but simply say, 'What has become of all your fine promises regarding Gangoba's attachment to us? He may, of course, act as he thinks proper.'\n\n\"Let the style of your letter to him be formal and impressive. You may also go on to say, 'You have always written to say Gangoba was devoted to us, and this we have not forgotten. Be it so: we shall see how matters turn out. You have been evidently acting a part for your own interests.'\n\n'Very well.'\n\n\"Gangoba will of course hear the contents of your letter; never mind: there is abundance of time to punish those who systematically deceive us. Tear this letter.\"\n\nThe struggle at Holkar's court was between the Dowager Ahilya Bhye and Gang\u00e1dihar Yeswant. The former finding such powerful opposition to her claims, applied secretly to the Peshwa to confirm the estates on her; while the minister, in conjunction with Ragoba, wished for the adoption of a boy, in order to preserve the management of affairs in his own hands. The latter object being defeated, Ragoba resolved to march southward, accompanied by all the great chiefs, with the avowed intention of demanding from his nephew a division of the empire, retaining in his own hands all the country north of the Godaveri, and permitting his nephew to manage uncontrolled all that lying to the south of that river.\nMadhu Rao resolved to resist this plan, and employed his emissaries in his uncle's camp to counteract his schemes; and Naro Sankar Raja Behadur, one of Ragoba's principal dependents, was gained over to the side of his nephew.\n\nRagoba's irritability of temper frequently disgusted his chiefs; and his liberality and profusion, though it secured the affection of his troops, usually involved him in pecuniary difficulties, as has been before shewn; but his situation was particularly embarrassing on the occasion of his return from Malwa. Having exhausted all the available resources in that quarter, he brought an army, with its pay in arrear to the amount of twenty-five lacs of rupees (\u00a3250,000), to the Deccan, and several of his chief officers disgusted: the project of claiming a division of the authority of the state was therefore more easily formed than carried into effect.\n\nIn the month of July Madhu Rao reached Poona, and Ragoba was on his march to the south, as appears by the following letter from Naro Hari (an officer in Candeish) to the Peshwa Madhu Rao.\n\n\"24th of July 1767.\n\n\"I arrived at Raweri near Burhanpur, and waited there in order to join his Highness Dada Sahib (Ragoba), on his return from Hindustan; but he took the route of Sindwa, by which he entered Candeish. I was therefore unable to join him before he reached Nere, on the Panzur river, from whence his Highness proceeded by the route of Mulhere, Tengora, and Dhuruss to Nasuck. Upon my informing him that I had collected and paid the revenues of the Batt\u00ed claims to your Highness, Dada Sahib (Ragoba) became very angry with me, and said, 'never mind, you will have to pay them to me at last.'\"\n\nNaro Sankar Raja Behadur, in his own hand, to Madhu Rao Bulal.\n\n\"22d of July 1767.\n\n\"I have seen Gang\u00e1dh\u00e1r Pant, who was sent here by your Highness, and received many kind assurances of your favour from him. God knows how much I am delighted: it is highly gratifying to me and worthy of yourself, to recollect your old servant. I am entirely devoted to your Highness's interests, and am only desirous of proving it. I have communicated unreservedly to Chimnaj\u00ed Mankeswar, who will represent what I have said to your Highness. You may rely also on what G\u00e1n-g\u00e1dh\u00e1r Pant will report, as quite true: as God is my witness.\"\nLetter from Gopal Rao Patwardhen of Mirch, in his own hand, to Madhu Rao Peshwa.\n\n\"5th of August 1767.\n\n\"I shall take the earliest opportunity of joining your Highness at Poona, and I shall direct my troops to follow me as you wish, by a few dropping in at a time in succession, till all my division arrives.\"\n\nMadhu Rao to Nana Farnev\u00eds.\n\n\"4th of September 1767.\n\n\"Aba Hashemnev\u00eds (superintendent of the garrison militia), the deputy of Chinto Vittel (Ragoba's minister), told me when I was at Poona that, if it was desirable, he could procure the forts of Asir and Ahmednagar to be delivered into my hands. At that time I did not deem it necessary to avail myself of his offer, but I should like to do so now. You must therefore speak privately to Aba Hashemnev\u00eds on this subject, and secure these forts: if he hesitates, and says he has not the same means of obtaining them as formerly, you must tell him at once plainly that I shall suspect him of having deserted my interests to espouse those of my uncle.\n\n\"Regarding the fort of Sewnere, Visaj\u00ed Pant and Naro Tryambak D\u00e9smukh talk of making it over to my uncle. Desire them for the present to make some excuse for delaying to do so till after he and I have met.\"\n\nGovind Sivaram to Nana Farnev\u00eds.\n\n\"Singwa, on the Godaveri, 2d of September 1767.\n\n\"Having gone to his Highness Ragoba's camp, and remained there three or four days, and communicated my business, I am thus far on my return to join his Highness Madhu Rao.\n\n\"His Highness Ragoba has sent Chinto Annud to accompany me, and by the blessing of God, their Highnesses will soon meet.\n\n\"It is to be hoped that matters will then be accommodated. At present they are very bad.\"\n\nMadhu Rao to Nana Farnev\u00eds.\n\n\"Rahuri, 9th of September 1767.\n\n\"Chinto Annud and Govind Sivaram have come here and stated what my uncle's intentions and wishes are. Among other proposals are, that he insists on my going to meet him with only five hundred men, and that he is\nnot to cross the Godaveri or the Dharna, but to remain in his camp with\nhis army and guns. Why should I take five hundred men with me? If\nI am to reign, ten attendants will be sufficient; if not, what would be\nthe use of twenty-five thousand men? With these feelings therefore I\nshall go on, and he may act as he thinks proper. It is very likely I may\nbe doing wrong; but that which is ordained by God must of necessity\nhappen. Misfortune may befall me; but go I will, whatever be the con-\nsequence. Do not shew this letter to any one. I depend much on\nSewacram Pant.\"\n\nThe result of this determination being made known to Ragoba, he wrote\nthe following letter to his nephew, in his own hand.\n\n\"9th of September 1767.\n\nWrite to me when it will be convenient for us to meet. In case you\nhave any troops with you, do not keep them behind, let them all come\non. Do not come alone. Our meeting on this occasion should take\nplace in proper state. It is long since we saw each other. Do not delay.\nTo-morrow will be Wednesday, and would be a good day, but the\nmeeting cannot take place. Friday, however, will answer as well.\nP.S.

At present it is not adviseable to\n\n* This expression alludes to the occupation of Sewnere by Ragoba's troops.\ndo any thing. We must wait till we see how matters turn out here. Some troops have been sent by my uncle I know, but we have to see whether they will be received into the garrison or not. We must maintain our communication with it as long as it is possible to do so.\n\nYou write that Aba has gained over the garrisons of Jivadhan and Hurshur. This is all right. Keep up your good understanding with them till it be time to act, of which I will apprize you.\n\nYou state that you have spoken to Aba about Asir and Ahmednagar, that you write the details respecting the former, and that he has communicated with his deputy regarding the latter. That is also right. Do not fail to let me know when you hear more about Nagar (Ahmednagar).\n\nYou state, as an objection to Tulaj\u00ed Angria being sent to Solapore, that it is full of Vidyadrug prisoners, and you recommend Dowlutabad in preference. This is true. Let him be sent under a safe escort therefore to Dowlutabad.\n\nYou advise me that you have sent Babu Rao Crishna to superintend the post-office department with me, and he was to have met me at the Sena river. I have seen nothing of him yet. If you have despatched him, however, he must join me soon.\"\n\nFrom Madhu Rao, in his own hand, to Nana Farnevis.\n\n12th of September 1767.\n\nMy uncle and I met yesterday: nothing beyond mere compliments passed. No business was transacted.\"\n\nFrom the same (in the hand-writing of Hari Pant) to the same.\n\n24th of September 1767.\n\nUp to this time we have had nothing but discussions; and finding there was little chance of our coming to any satisfactory accommodation, I resolved to march away, and abide by the result. In the mean time, the ministers on both sides induced my uncle to accept of the following conditions, with a promise on his part to allow me the sole control of my own affairs, while I agreed to treat him with becoming respect, and even to consult him on matters of great importance.\n\nHe required for himself an estate yielding ten lacs of rupees (\u00a3100,000) annually, and some forts. There would have been no difficulty on my part in acceding to these terms, but it seemed to me very unlikely that he\nwould remain satisfied and quiet, even after I had fulfilled them. The delay of a day ensued in consequence; but my ministers were of opinion that I ought to close with these conditions at once. I found therefore I had nothing to do but to give my consent, as they might afterwards reproach me, if anything should occur. I accordingly told them to act as they chose; and, as there was some cause for thinking that if the Mogul (the Nizam) should come into this neighbourhood, he might intrigue in that quarter, I believe I have done right.\n\nThese are the terms:\n\nArticle 1st. My uncle is to have an estate of ten lacs. Also twelve forts are to be retained by him, as follows:\n- Oundi Patta and its dependencies ............ 4 forts.\n- The Kownye district ......................... 5 do.\n- Bhaskurgur .................................. 1 do.\n- Multun ...................................... 1 do.\n- Trimbuck ..................................... 1 do.\n\nAsir, Ahmednagar, Sewnere, Satara, and all the other forts are to be placed in my possession.\n\nArticle 2d. His Highness Madhu Rao's government is to pay the balances due to the chiefs and troops on account of the late war in Hindustan, provided they do not exceed twenty-five lacs of rupees. The whole of this sum is to be paid within one year, and security to be given for its payment; when this is done, orders for the delivery of the forts into the hands of his Highness Madhu Rao will be granted in return.\n\nArticle 3d. His Highness Madhu Rao is in future to manage the concerns of his government in Hindustan, with which his Highness Raghunath Rao (Ragoba) is not to interfere.\n\nThe same with regard to Guzerat.\nThe same with regard to Gaikwar.\n\nOn these points, his Highness Madhu Rao is to be his own master.\n\nArticle 4th. The chiefs Sindia, Holkar, Naro Sankar Raja Behadur, Vittul Sivad\u00e9va Vinchur Kur, Tryambak Rao Sivad\u00e9va Vinchur Kur, Jewaji Powar, &c., &c., are required to perform their accustomed service to his Highness Madhu Rao's government, and to abstain from all foreign and domestic intrigues; to obey his orders, and to go wherever they may be required. On the above terms, the estates at\npresent held by those chiefs respectively shall be allowed to remain in their possession.\n\nArticle 5th. His Highness Raghun\u0101th Rao (Ragoba) is to abstain from all political intercourse whatsoever with Bhosla (Raja of Nagpore). If he has business with him, it must be transacted through his Highness Madhu Rao's government.\n\nArticle 6th. His Highness Raghun\u0101th Rao (Ragoba) agrees to abstain generally from all political intercourse with other states, and from domestic intrigues of every sort; and promises not to act in any way so as to affect the interests of his Highness Madhu Rao's government.\n\nArticle 7th. A body of cavalry, consisting of two hundred and fifty men,* are to be paid by government, and to attend his Highness Raghun\u0101th Rao as a guard of honour.\n\nArticle 8th. No chiefs nor individuals are to be punished by either party on account of the share they may have taken in the late discussions; and if they perform their duty in future with fidelity, it is promised they shall be treated with favour.\n\nThe above articles, drawn up by the ministers on both sides, were ratified by the mutual oaths of the parties themselves.\n\nThe detail of the cessions will be found in a separate schedule which is preparing, a copy of which will be forwarded. The heads only are mentioned for your information. My uncle is now to retire to Anandivalli, and after the arrival of the Poona bankers, who have been sent for, security will be given for the payments, and the orders for the delivery of the forts will be received. After they are in our possession I shall proceed to Poona. Such is the state of affairs here. You have been desired to raise men for the forts. We shall require about 1,500 who may be depended on. You may now discharge such of the cavalry at Poona as can be dispensed with, keeping only the Suranjam horse. Let the Poona bankers be sent as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe original instrument, with the seals of the parties, is dated on the next day, the 25th of September 1767. The following document contains some additional articles:\n\n* This number, at the request of his uncle, was increased to three hundred and fifty men.\n\"Memorandum. Additional requisitions made by his Highness Raghunath Rao, and agreed to by the Peshwa, written in the hand of each:\n\nIn Raghunath Rao's hand:\n\"Article I. In case Bhosla (Raja of Nagpore), the Gaikwar, or any other chiefs should have made use of expressions, or conducted themselves for my sake in an offensive manner, no notice is now to be taken of what has passed. If they are guilty of high crimes hereafter, let them be punished accordingly.\n\n\"Article II. In the event of the troops of government passing through my estates and damaging them, I am to be indemnified for the loss, if considerable. If the damage does not exceed one thousand rupees, I shall make no demand for remuneration.\n\n\"Article III. If Holkar should plunder the districts on the Ner-budda, he shall be fined in four times the amount.\n\n\"Article IV. When Damaji Gaikwar, Bhosla, Holkar, Sindia, and other such great chiefs proceed from hence to their commands, it would be gratifying to me that they should come to Anandivalli, and after re-\n\nIn Madhu Rao's hand:\n\"Article I. The persons alluded to shall not be visited with punishment for any thing that has occurred. If any one should be guilty in future, he will be punished accordingly.\n\n\"Agreed.\n\n\"Article II. Government troops have no business on your estates; notwithstanding which, orders shall be issued to prevent damage. The district of Hindia may lie on the road, but precautions shall be taken to prevent damage. If it should be only trifling, it is hoped you will pass it over: if the damage be heavy, it shall be made good to you.\n\n\"Agreed.\n\n\"Article III. If Holkar wantonly plunder your districts, he shall be compelled to make restitution for the injury sustained.\n\n\"Agreed.\n\n\"Article IV. When the chiefs of Hindustan return, they shall be directed to wait on you on their departure, when you may entertain them for three or four days, and then take leave of them.\"\n\"maining with me three or four days,\ntake their final leave.\n\n\"Article V. Measures are to be\ntaken for the payment of the cash\nwithin the limited period.\n\n\"You may rely on meeting with no\nobstacle to your wishes in this respect.\nAgreed.\n\n\"Article V.

Keroji Powar,\nwho is bound to maintain one hun-\ndred and fifty horse; and Bandi,\none hundred horse, are already in-\ncluded in the agreement; besides\nwhich, one hundred additional horse\non the same footing shall be placed\nat your disposal; making in all,\nthree hundred and fifty horse.\nAgreed.\n\n\"Article IX. Twenty-five thousand\nrupees worth of goods will be sent\nto you annually, if demanded, from\nthe next year.\nAgreed.\"\n\n\"Done in camp, at Anandivalli, the 30th of September 1767.\"\n\"Memorandum, in the hand-writing of Hari Pant Ferkia:\n\n\"Anandivalli, 6th of October 1767.\n\n\"The bankers of Poona having agreed to pay to Dada Sahib (Ragoba) the sum of twenty-five lacs of rupees, this amount is to be recovered by them out of the following payments due, viz.\n\n\"Holkar .................................. Rupees 9,25,000\n\"Sindia .................................. 10,00,000\n\"Bhosla .................................. 3,00,000\n\"U'deypur Rana ......................... 2,00,000\n\"Apaaji Ganesa .......................... 3,00,000\n\"Basalat Jeng ........................... 2,50,000\n\n\"Rupees 29,75,000\n\n\"The above sums are to be allotted exclusively for repayment to the bankers.\"\n\nAffairs had thus been brought to a crisis which left Madhu Rao the uncontrolled ruler of his dominions; and though it reduced the power of Ragoba, it left him with a princely income, and with a small principality apparently well suited to his station in the kingdom. Madhu Rao, however, had all along foreseen that his uncle would not be satisfied with his condition; and we accordingly find him, in a very few months after, actively engaging in political intrigues with Bhosla, the Raja of Nagpore; and the hopes he obtained from that quarter induced him to break into open insurrection. Besides fifteen thousand men raised for the occasion, Damaji, the Gaikwar, lent him his aid; and Gangadhar Yeswant, the ex-minister of Holkar, was his principal coadjutor. Madhu Rao lost not a moment in marching to oppose his uncle, whose troops were defeated in a battle fought under the fort of Dhurap, forty miles north of Nasuc. On this occasion Ragoba, mounted on an elephant, was taken prisoner, and brought, escorted by a party of horse, to the Peshwa. The young hero, instead of upbraiding him, or triumphing over his misfortunes, brought his own elephant alongside that of his uncle, and courteously handed him into his own seat, in which way the uncle and nephew rode conversing together into camp, so that the spectators actually believed a reconciliation had been effected. This was, however, impossible; Madhu Rao perceiving the necessity for limiting his uncle's power more effectually, and took measures accordingly.\nGang\u00e1dhar Yeswant, Holkar's ex-minister, had by his conduct forfeited the protection secured to him and others by the treaty of Anandivalli, concluded with Ragoba the year before; and we therefore find the following bond in the hand-writing of Gang\u00e1dhar Yeswant, dated the 13th of July 1768.\n\n\"I agree to pay, through the agency of Gopal Rao Govind, the sum of twenty-nine lacs and fifty thousand rupees (\u00a3295,000), as a fine to the government. Meanwhile, till the full payment is completed, I am not to be liable for any pecuniary negociations which I may be obliged to enter into in order to realize this amount.\n\nAfter paying the whole sum, if a balance of a lac or a lac and a-half of rupees (\u00a310,000 or \u00a315,000) should remain in my hands or in those of my son, the government is to allow us to retain it for the support of our family. In case, however, any larger sum should subsequently be discovered, either in our hands or in those of any banker or other person whatsoever between Rameswur and Benares, or between Ahmedabad and Attock, belonging to me, the government is at liberty freely to seize it.\"\n\nOn the arrival of the Peshwa and his uncle at Poona, the following arrangements appear to have been made, according to a memorandum existing in Madhu Rao's hand-writing.\n\n\"26th of June 1768.\n\nI. The forts and estates lately in possession of my uncle Ragoba, are to be managed in future by officers of our own government and of our own nomination. Out of consideration to my uncle, however, orders shall be sent in his name, and the reports shall be addressed to him.\n\nII. The expenditure of the ten lacs of revenue for my uncle's use are to be submitted to us, but all balances in his favour are to be credited to my uncle, whose expenditure must not exceed that sum.\n\nIII. My uncle is to remain in Poona, and not to quit it without our knowledge. If he wishes to visit the temples on the banks of the several sacred rivers, he shall be allowed to do so while we remain in Poona, and a proper escort will attend him, but in our absence he must not quit the capital.\n\nIV. The persons at present in my uncle's service are not to be molested; but no one can be permitted to remain in it without our sanction.\"\nThe army proceeding against the Raja of Berar left Poona, probably in the latter end of 1768 or early in 1769; and the following letter from Moraba, cousin of Nana Farnevis, who accompanied the Peshwa, written by his orders, shews the state of affairs when the campaign was nearly brought to a close.\n\n\"Camp, Umerkehr, 2d of April 1769.\n\n\"I have received your letter of the 17th March. The news here is this:\n\"The Peshwa left Poona with the intention of proceeding to the Carnatic,\nand of availing himself of the circumstances which might arise out of\nthe war between Hyder and the English. The army accordingly reached\nSerapur, when Bhosla wrote to say he had with him an army of 20,000\nmen; that he had been ordered to attend the Peshwa, and to bring with\nhim a small retinue; but that his army was in want of pay, and would not\npermit him to quit. He observed, therefore, that he could not separate\nhimself from his army, but that he should send his minister Dewakar Pant\nto head-quarters. His Highness the Peshwa, by calling on Java Ji Bhosla,\nwished to try his fidelity, of which he had great doubts; and this conduct\nconfirmed his suspicions. Besides, his Highness Ragoba being at Poona,\nhe thought it imprudent to leave his dominions open to intrigues during his\nabsence in another direction. Moreover, he has no confidence in a third\nperson (Sakeram Bapu, one of the most able, but most intriguing\npoliticians then in India). He accordingly resolved to march towards\nBhosla, and compel his attendance. For this purpose he marched,\nattended by a division of the Nizam's army, under Rukn-ud-Doula, as\nfar as Dharur. Here we were met by Bhosla's representative, Dewakar\nPant, who made fair promises in the name of his master; but it was\nthought advisable to move towards his army, which retired as we advanced.\nOn reaching Berar, the country was laid waste with fire and sword, while\nBhosla continued flying before our troops. A light detachment was\naccordingly formed (consisting of twelve thousand men, under Gopal\nRao of Mirch), which went in pursuit for upwards of a month without\novertaking the enemy; and Bhosla eventually fled into the forests (the\nwoods of Gondwana): our cavalry, both men and horses, were fairly\nworn out. It was once intended to besiege Chanda, but his Highness\nhad not the proper means nor sufficient men, so that it was at length\nresolved to leave Ramchandra Gan\u00e9s and Rukn-ud-Doula in Berar,\nand that his Highness should return. The Nizam's troops, little prepared\nfor the privations and hardships they had already endured, and unwilling\nto incur more, became discontented, and positively refused to remain. In\nthis state of affairs D\u00e9w\u00e1k\u00e1r Pant (Bhosla's minister), who had been all\nalong in camp, remonstrated against leaving any troops at all. He\nstated, that to form a cantonment in Berar fit to contain such an army\nas Ramchandra Gan\u00e9s must necessarily have with him, would incur an\nexpense of at least twenty lacs of rupees, which could never be repaid\nby Bhosla. He entreated therefore for his master, that his Highness\nthe Peshwa would be satisfied with having ravaged the country, and\nexpelled Bhosla from it, and begged that the Peshwa would now\naccept his contrition. His Highness, on mature consideration, was\ninduced to accede to the reasoning of D\u00e9w\u00e1k\u00e1r Pant, and consented to\npermit him to quit the camp and bring Bhosla to head-quarters, on con-\ndition of his giving up twelve lacs of his old jagir and three lacs of his new\njagir, and of his paying five lacs in specie; the cessions and specie to\nbe shared equally by the allies.\n\nAfter Bhosla arrives, visits will be interchanged for two or three\ndays, when we shall return, as well as Ramchandra Gan\u00e9s's division.\nThe Nizam's troops are also to go home.\n\nD\u00e9w\u00e1k\u00e1r Pant is to accompany this army. You shall know more\nwhen we meet.\"\n\nThe army reached Poona at the end of May, and the aspect of affairs in\nthe south rendered it necessary for the Peshwa to direct his attention to\nthat quarter: among other measures of precaution, was that of removing\nthe Carnatic infantry from the garrisons in that quarter of the country, and\nreplacing them by Mahrattas whom he could trust. The Peshwa writes thus\nto his brother Narayan Rao, then quite a youth:\n\n\"5th of July 1769.\n\nI request that all the Carnatic infantry in the garrisons of the southern\nfrontier may be relieved in Chinroydrug, Mudgirry, &c. &c., and their\nplace supplied by Mahratta infantry.\"\n\nBut the Peshwa's first object was to prevent his uncle being mischievous\nduring his absence; and the circumstantial proofs of his designs, up to the\nvery last moment of the war with Bhosla, were so complete, that he felt\nhimself justified in imposing new and more rigid terms on him for the\nfuture.\nThe incorrigible habits of Ragoba seemed to promise no hopes of amendment, and we are almost surprised that any terms were again offered to him; but respect for his father's brother, and perhaps even for public opinion, prevented Madhu Rao from proceeding to the extremity of making Ragoba a prisoner in a hill-fort. He was permitted to reside within the town of Poona, and to take exercise within its limits; but it became necessary to restrict his excursions, and to deprive him of the power of foreign communication. To attain these ends, the draft of certain terms was made by Madhu Rao, which exists in his own hand-writing; and the actual conditions framed by Nana Farnevis, and acceded to by Ragoba, are written in the hands of that minister and the state prisoner. They are as follow:\n\n\"Terms concluded with Ragoba Dada at Poona.\n\nIn Nana Farnevis' hand.\n\n\"I. To abstain from all political intrigues.\n\n\"II. To abstain from writing orders or letters.\n\n\"III. Not to ask to quit the city.\n\n\"IV. Not to bring forward new proposals.\n\n\"In case it be found necessary, on account of disturbance or other danger,\u2014to retire, without delay, to such place as may be pointed out.\n\nIn Ragoba Dada's hand.\n\n\"I. I agree to do so.\n\n\"II. I agree to abstain from doing so clandestinely. If I write letters, they shall be open to inspection.\n\n\"III. I agree not to be importunate on this point.\n\n\"IV. It may be necessary for me to mention trifling points, but it will remain with you to accede to them or not. If it does not seem fit to do so, you need not; on which occasions I promise to assent to the decision without opposition. Abide only by your own engagements, and do not depart from them.\n\n\"V. Under such circumstances, relying upon you, I shall go; but I am only to be sent away on occasions of great necessity, and am to be quickly brought back. You are not to take advantage of this clause to\nVI. Not to starve yourself.\n\nVII. Not to curse us; or to employ Brahmins to do so; or use incantations.\n\ndestroy my confidence in you. On such occasions I shall go without position, putting my trust in God.\n\nVI. If you abide by your engagements, I promise not to starve out of spite.*\n\nVII. I promise not to pray to God to curse you, for I shall pray for your prosperity. If you suspect me of doing the former, I am without remedy; but neither will I do so intentionally, nor employ any Brahmin to do so. If it should be done without my knowledge, I am not to be responsible.\u2020 All will reap the fruit of their own labour: I certainly will employ no one to curse or to hurt another, excepting he be the enemy of God, and it is to such only I wish evil.\n\nIn case I am ever suspected of such conduct, let the circumstances be fully investigated, and the guilty be punished accordingly.\n\nTo this I agree.\"\n\nThe following postscript is in Ragoba's hand-writing:\n\n\"I have agreed to abide by the conditions of the above seven articles, but\n\n* This remarkable proposition requires some explanation. The most heinous crime of which a Hindu can be guilty is to cause the death of a Brahmin, and the crime would be considerably aggravated by that person being so near a relative as Ragoba was to Madhu Rao. The imposition therefore of terms which should drive him to the desperate resolve of starvation, of which the natives of India are frequently capable, would, by implication, bring the guilt of his uncle's murder on the nephew's head; and this article was therefore introduced to prevent its occurrence.\n\n\u2020 My Indian friends, who assisted me in examining this collection of papers, and who were about the court at the time, say this passage was considered to allude to Anandi Bhye, the wife of Ragoba, who was notorious for employing magicians and enchanters against Madhu Rao.\n\"after you have confidence in me from my behaviour in the course of two\nor three years,* I am to be more at liberty, and to be allowed to go about\nif I choose. I am not to be unnecessarily restrained. I promise to abstain\nfrom all political intrigues; but in case I should be falsely accused on this\nhead, let the facts be investigated fairly. Do not act on loose assertions.\n\n\"6th of August 1769.\n\n\"P.S. The time of restraint is not to be fixed for two or three years.\nLet the restrictions be taken off whenever my conduct has removed all\nsuspicion.\nLet the time not be fixed.\"\n\nHaving secured himself, as far as appeared necessary to him, against his\nuncle's intrigues, Madhu Rao turned his thoughts to the civil administration\nof his country, for which he had hitherto had no leisure. The picture exhibited\nby Captain Grant Duff in his history of the Mahrattas, of the exertions of\nthis young prince and his able coadjutor Ram Sastri, to reform the judicial\nsystem, and of his finance ministers to improve that of his revenue, is as\ncreditable to them as it is pleasing for us to reflect upon.\n\nOf the able judge Ram Sastri, he observes: \"The prince's endeavours\nwere aided by the celebrated Ram Sastri, a name which stands alone on\nMahratta records as an upright and pure judge, and whose character,\nadmirable under any circumstances, is wonderful amidst such selfish-\nness, venality, and corruption, as are almost universal in a Mahratta\ncourt.\"\n\nMadhu Rao became the pupil of this excellent man, and was at one time\nso abstracted in theological studies as to alarm his faithful preceptor, who\nin a manner sufficiently indicative of his disapprobation, begged to be\nallowed to retire from office to Benares, in case his pupil the prince of the\nrealm, neglected his duties to his subjects and the state by following the\npractices of a priest. Madhu Rao acknowledged the justness of the rebuke,\nand gave up that deep application to study to which he was becoming\ninclined.\n\nIn the finance department he had discovered many abuses, which he was\ngradually correcting when he received intimation that Hyder had made\n\n* The words in italics have a pen run through them in the original, and this fact shews\nhow Ragoba's mind vacillated on the point of any stated time for the restrictions.\npeace with the English, and not only refused to pay the tribute due, but had even levied contributions on some of the chiefs tributary to the Peshwa.\n\nA large body of cavalry was therefore pushed forward to the frontier, and in the month of November 1769 Madhu Rao left Poona, at the head of fifteen thousand infantry and twenty thousand cavalry.\n\nThe progress of his arms is best shewn by his own letter to Nana Farnevis, received at Poona the 30th of January 1770.\n\n\"On crossing the Tungbudra, the main army was joined by the troops of Doulut Rao Ghoripori, Narsing Rao, and Anand Rao Gofal; when leaving Anand Rao Rastia and Gopal Rao of Mirch, to oppose Hyder in the district of Savanore, I proceeded towards Seringapatam, avoiding the districts of Harpunhulli and Chitledrug. The first places occupied, on the 14th January, were Budhyal, Kimpkerr\u00ed, Humpkerr\u00ed, and Chiknalhulli. There are three or four other places which must soon fall. Small forts cannot stand our artillery, but those I allude to are not to be taken without heavier guns. Country yielding a lac or a lac and a-quarter of huns (\u00a365,000) annually, has been recovered. The chief of Chitledrug has joined me with five thousand infantry, a thousand cavalry, three or four guns, five camel loads of rockets, and eight elephants; and, moreover, promises to fight. A communication has been made from Muhammed Ali Khan (Nabob of Arcot), that he also will afford us aid. Balaram conveyed this intelligence. The Nabob has been desired to send some respectable persons of his own, with proper credentials and powers to negociate.\n\nHyder Naic was in the Bednore forest on the 7th January, having sent his son (Tippu) towards Bangalore. This season Hyder's field equipments are tolerably good.\"\n\nMadhu Rao to Naro Babji, manager of Dharur.\n\n\"6th of March 1770.\n\nTwo or three letters have been written to you to enlist a thousand infantry, and to send them on to the camp, to occupy the places as they are taken. You write that men cannot be had for the purpose in your district, but that you will endeavour to raise them in Sawuntwarr\u00ed. The head-quarters now are in the vicinity of Nandighur (Nundidrug), and men are required to form garrisons for the newly conquered places. You must contrive to procure the men and to send them to us. I trust those\n\"you expect from Sawuntwarri have arrived ere this; send them on to Sera\nas they come in.\"\n\nIn the hand-writing of Hari Pant Farkia, to the same.\n\n\"9th of March 1770.\n\n\"Send on the new levies as soon as possible. You may go as far as nine\nrupees monthly pay to each man. They should for the most part have\nfire-arms, though a few Pat'hakaris (men using the double-edged broad-\nsword) may also be enlisted, but not too many of them.\"\n\nThe health of the Peshwa declining about this time, he returned to\nPoona, from whence he writes a short letter to the same person on a military\nsubject. It is as follows:\n\n\"Poona, 15th of September 1770.\n\n\"You may attack Durkunhulli, if you think you have the means of doing\nso with effect, but on no account run the risk of failure; on the contrary,\nwait till I reach the place with the army which will march from hence.\"\n\nOn the Peshwa quitting the army in the field, it was left under the com-\nmand of his first master in the military art, his maternal uncle Tryambak\nRao Marwa. After the rainy season was over in Poona, Madhu Rao took\nthe field again to join the army.\n\nThis movement must have taken place early in November, for in that\nmonth he wrote the following confidential letter. It is not difficult to suppose\nthat the innuendoes contained in it have reference principally to his uncle\nand his party, though the language is by no means so plain as to give much\ninsight into the real objects of the communication.\n\nMadhu Rao to Nana Farnevis.\n\n\"22d of November 1770.\n\n\"In consequence of my not having been able to see you before I marched,\nyou were obliged to entrust what you had to say to Har\u00ed Pant. It does\nnot in the least signify; I know your disposition towards me, and I feel\nassured that you will act for me in my absence with the utmost zeal and\nfidelity. Professions on your part are quite unnecessary to convince me\nof this. You recollect there were three or four points we discussed, four\nor five days since, which were not to be made known to others, and\nwhich you will of course not mention. You spoke out to me on that\noccasion without reserve, and I replied with the same degree of con-\nfidence, but it must go no farther. I repeat it, this must never be spoken\n\"of. Conceal nothing from me in my absence of what you may learn.\n\"Write to me with confidence. Speak out boldly. Conceal nothing I\n\"entreat you; what I write to you, I shall do with perfect reliance that it\n\"will not be spoken of to any one. Maintain the same good faith you have\n\"ever done. I have never been so plain with any one before; your business\n\"is not now confined to one point; I shall rely on you, not only for infor-\n\"mation, but also for advice on all subjects. I feel convinced you will\n\"advise what is right. A hint from you will suffice to enable me to act,\n\"as I am assured you will recommend nothing but what is proper.\n\"I shall frequently apply to you on points that I could not venture to\n\"trust to any other person; and as I find my confidence is repaid, so shall I\n\"apply to you without hesitation. We are bound to each other by the\n\"most solemn oaths to reveal nothing of what passes between us.\n\"With regard to the questions I have left for you to consider, when I\n\"hear your opinion I shall avail myself of any hints you may give, and issue\n\"the necessary instructions.\n\"Destroy this letter the instant you have read it.\"\n\nThis letter is written evidently in great agitation; several words are left\nout, the usual lines connecting the words are omitted, and the same\nsentiment is frequently repeated; and it is altogether unlike Madhu Rao's\nusually clear style.\n\nThe Peshwa's health declining daily, he made but little progress towards the\nsouth; and in the month of June 1771 he vested his maternal uncle Tryambac\nRao with full powers as commander-in-chief, and sent him the great seal,\nmaking him in every respect his representative in the field. Tryambac\nRao so completely fulfilled his sovereign's wishes that he reduced Hyder\nto the greatest distress, and at the very gates of Seringapatam dictated a\npeace in the following year, by which he obtained thirty-six lacs of rupees\nas arrears of tribute, and an agreement to pay fourteen lacs annually in\nfuture.\n\nOur attention must now be drawn towards the affairs at Poona. Madhu\nRao's indisposition prevented his attending to business; and some of the\nministers began to look towards Ragoba as the person into whose hands the\ngovernment might again fall in case of the Peshwa's death and the accession\nof his younger brother Narayan Rao, a youth equally irritable and wrong-\nheaded. This state of affairs added to the anxiety of the Peshwa's mind\nand increased his disorder, which proved to be consumption.\n\nVol. II.\nThe letters, which passed at this period, are full of interest, but they are in many instances ambiguous, and some of them being without date, it is not easy to place them in the series. The physicians conceiving the air of Poona unwholesome for his complaint, the Peshwa moved to Sidtek, a village a few miles from the capital, which he reached in January 1772. Nana was left, as usual, in charge of Poona, under the Peshwa's brother, Narayan Rao, while Nana's cousin, who was jealous of the confidence reposed in him by the Peshwa, filled the office of secretary with Madhu Rao, around whom, during his illness, all the great chiefs of the empire assembled, both out of courtesy, as well as to observe what was likely to be the result in case of his death.\n\nShortly after the Peshwa left Poona, Nana Farnevis found the young prince, Narayan Rao, lending himself to a party, and permitting them to assume a degree of interference in the public business, to which Nana was by no means disposed to submit. The following letters on this subject shew his feeling:\n\nNana Farnevis to Madhu Rao Peshwa.\n\n\"Your Highness on your departure said, 'His Highness Narayan Rao will remain here in my absence; do not imagine therefore there will be any difficulty.' This is true: but there is a vast deal of business to be transacted, and where confidence exists there are no obstacies. This does not appear to be the case here. The reproofs, the opposition, and the delays which occur, do not originate with his Highness perhaps; but why should I have been selected to become subject to them? If your Highness should be absent for many months, business cannot be allowed to stand still; but I beg of you to consider how I am to conduct it without your support.\n\n\"I am extremely unwilling, in the present state of your health, to trouble you on such matters, but I could not on this occasion avoid it. All I wish is, that when I bring papers to receive the young prince's signature, they may be passed at once, without the intervention of other people. In case his Highness should wish for explanation, I am on the spot, and always ready to afford it. If your Highness does not feel sufficient confidence in me to admit of this, I beg I may be allowed to join your camp at once. Every thing else goes on smoothly.\n\n\"This is what I begged of Har\u00ed Pant to mention, but I am not sure\n\"that he has done so. Your Highness knows more of the state of the case than I have mentioned. If you are resolved matters should go on as at present, command me to that effect.\"\n\nReply in Madhu Rao's hand, on the face of the letter.\n\n\"I will communicate to you through Har\u00ed Pant this evening: if I were to sit down to reply, I should be obliged to write a long letter, which I could not do. I shall send a message therefore by Har\u00ed Pant.\"\n\nHar\u00ed Pant to Nana on the same subject.\n\n\"I have received your letter, begging of me to state what I told his Highness Narayan Rao, on the occasion of your being left at Poona, and to mention if I had been at all equivocal in my communication with him. You observe also, that you are prepared to quit Poona and come to the camp. In reply to which I beg to assure you, that I mentioned all you wished to his Highness Madhu Rao, and was directed in consequence to wait on his Highness Narayan Rao, and to tell him, as follows: 'Nana is left here to conduct the civil duties of the districts; he will also write the mukhalasi (the concluding line and date of all public documents), and having explained their contents to you, will obtain from you the final signature of diazi (let it be fulfilled), without reference to Dada (Ragoba Dada is probably meant). In case you have any difficulty in comprehending the papers, send for Nana to explain.' This is what I was directed to inform his Highness Narayan Rao, which I did. What is it possible to do more? I do not see what more can be done. If anything else occurs to you, let me know, and I will represent it; but I cannot perceive what you can wish for more. Still I am prepared to do anything you desire.\"\n\nMoraba to his cousin Nana Farnev\u00eds.\n\n\"Sidtek, 6th of January 1772.\n\n\"His Highness Madhu Rao's health is so much worse, that he has consented to allow the Padre to see him.\"\n\nThis was probably some Portuguese priest, who understood something of medicine.\n\nFrom the same to the same.\n\n\"17th of January 1772.\n\n\"His Highness is alarmingly ill. He is better for a few days, and then\n\"relapses again into his former state. It is really very difficult to say what may happen, and how soon. He does not gain strength at all.\"\n\nThis information gave great hopes to Ragoba, who had already ingratiated himself with his nephew Narayan Rao, the ostensible governor of Poona. Sukaram Bapu, already mentioned as an able ex-minister, and described as rather disposed towards Ragoba, formed a cabal with him to vex Nana Farnevis, who now left Poona, and went to his master at Sidtek. We are not acquainted with what passed at this meeting, but the following familiar correspondence shews the nature of the feelings which existed between them at the time.\n\n**Letter from Nana to Madhu Rao**, without date.\n\n\"My cousin Moraba acquainted me that he obtained permission for me to proceed to-morrow. But I was sorry to perceive, when we parted, that you were out of spirits, and apparently not in good-humour. It has occurred to me since, that you have only yielded to my wish to be allowed to go; or am I to refer your behaviour to the fact of your being worse? If I have your free permission I will go; if not I will stay in camp, though my health requires some relaxation from business, and change of air. I shall however conform entirely to your wishes. All the current business is done with the exception of that of Dharwar. There are some important points, however, which can only be done at Poona, where the records are. With regard to the Gaikwar question, when we are both equally well-informed, there will be no difficulty. Naro Appaji has charge of the current business of Poona, which your Highness can, if you choose, leave altogether in his hands. If any thing extraordinary should occur, I shall be always ready to undertake it if such is your wish. If not, I shall not interfere. I am anxious to proceed to Menoley * before I return to Poona, which will cause a delay of some days; but on this point I shall be guided by your wishes.\"\n\n**Reply from Madhu Rao**, in his own hand.\n\n\"I was really very unwell: it was nothing else. When Moraba asked leave for you to return, I said, 'Let him wait a few days, and then let him go, unless his business is very urgent, in which case he may go at\n\n* A village near Wai, where Nana's personal estate is situated, and on which his widow still resides.\n\"\u2018once.\u2019 I shall communicate to you in detail through Guruji (the private preceptor and priest) and Moraba. At present the Gaikwar affair is the only business of consequence; it is nearly concluded, but it cannot be brought to a close without Moraba and yourself consulting and making the final arrangements. The other matters are unimportant.\"\n\nRagoba Dad\u00e1 became now very importunate to see his nephew Madhu Rao, who writes to Nana, on the 20th of February 1772, thus:\n\n\"I entreat you to prevent my uncle Ragoba quitting Poona under the plea of coming to visit me. In the first place he must again swear to conform to the seven articles last drawn up and acceded to by him, and by these he must abide.\n\nI enclose the form of an oath in the hand-writing of Har\u00ed Pant Farkia; which I require you to administer to him.\"\n\nMemorandum in the hand-writing of Nana Farnevis.\n\n\"23d of February 1772.\n\nHis Highness Dada Sahib objects to the expression (nehuri) \u2018permanent\u2019 in the oath. He observes, \u2018I will abide by the agreement as long as the terms are kept by the other party, and will on no account infringe it.\u2019 He conceives permanency to be implied in that. He has no objection to swear to every other part.\"\n\nMoraba Farnevis to his cousin Nana.\n\n\"23d of February 1772.\n\nYour letter has been received, stating that you had been sent for by Dada Sahib (Ragoba); that he had ordered his preparations for moving, but that the lady (Anund\u00ed Bhye, Ragoba\u2019s wife) had scolded well, so that Ramchunder Pant and the other ministers were confounded. Who is to be afraid of her tongue? What can she do? It has not disturbed us here at all. I have represented all you wrote on the subject. His Highness the Peshwa asked me if I could be certain that his uncle would take the oath required of him. How could I say so? I wrote to you, and from your answer I perceived we should have a long correspondence if the business were negociated by letter, so it is resolved to send Crishna Rao. Bhosla has reached Pyctun, and has from two thousand to two thousand five hundred men with him. He is to arrive on the 12th Magwud (2d March); Bhawan\u00ed Pant and Ramaj\u00ed Pant have already come.\"\n\"Mudhaj\u00ed Bhosla has seen Tahavur Jeng, and has settled the ghass-dana (tribute).\n\n\"Rumbaj\u00ed (Rao Rumba) has gone since I came here.\n\n\"His Highness the Peshwa has been worse during the last three days. He has been frequently delirious. He is sometimes better, sometimes worse.\n\n\"No one knows how to treat his case; Huk\u00edjm\u00ed (a Muhammedan physician) has therefore been sent for. He is reputed clever as a physician and a chemist. His Highness intends moving to Tewur on the 25th February. We shall see whether he will or not.\"\n\nMadhu Rao to Nana; written by Har\u00ed Pant Farkia.\n\n\"15th of March 1772.\n\n\"You write that my uncle sent for you, and said that Saturday was a good day for coming here; that he gave orders to have his equipage ready; that he wants the horse-carriage (an English coach) to be sent for him; that as Krishna Rao was gone, he had fixed on Saturday or Sunday, and that you would move with him or not, according to the reply from hence: that if he did come on that day he was desirous I should go and stay a few days at Poona, after which he would like to go to the Godaveri; also that if the day fixed was not agreeable to me, he had no objection to the 28th of March, thirteen days hence.\n\n\"Saturday is the day fixed on for Bhosla's taking leave; so that day is disposed of. The following day is lucky for both\u2014before eight o'clock in the morning for me, and till sunset for him; but as it is not so for me, it will be better we should meet before eight in the morning. If he accedes to this arrangement, let me know, and you can come with him at once.\n\n\"The horse-carriage is sent, according to his wishes; also an elephant and ambarr\u00ed (the latter is a seat with a royal canopy over it), besides two of my own riding horses. Tell him so. Let me have an answer before noon to-morrow. If he reaches Kowr\u00ed before eight o'clock on Sunday, it will do. If he is later we shall miss the time. You will of course take care that a suitable escort, both of cavalry and infantry, attends him. In case he should object to this arrangement, the meeting may be put off till the 28th March.\"\nMoraba Farnev\u00eds to his cousin Nana Farnev\u00eds.\n\n\"16th of March 1772.\n\n\"You write, that in consequence of urgent affairs, you shall not be able\nto accompany Dada Sahib, and beg to be excused. I am instructed to\nsay you are permitted to remain. Naro Pant and Jenardhun Ram are\nto accompany him. Make proper arrangements, though you do not come\nyourself.\"\n\nFrom the same to the same.\n\n\"29th of March 1772.\n\n\"His Highness has been very ill for the last few days, so that no business\ncould be done on Sunday with Dada Sahib (his uncle). They are to\nmeet on Friday. His Highness is, I think, worse to-day, and is extremely\nweak. He has been prevailed on to be weighed.* Bhosla marched this\nday. He goes first to Jejuri, and then returns home. He is now at\nBalapur. On his taking leave, three guns, besides elephants and horses,\nwere presented to him.\n\n\"When you have leisure, come over here.\"\n\nDuring the rainy season between June and September, the Peshwa's\nhealth improved. As no later letters, however, have been found by me\nthan the last which has been recorded, we are left in doubt as to the turn\naffairs took after the meeting of the uncle and nephew. The Mahratta\nhistorian, Grant Duff, observes:\u2020 \"As the health of his nephew declined,\nRaghunat'h Rao (Ragoba) began intrigues with Hyder Ali and the\nNizam, in order to obtain complete enlargement, and secure his succes-\nsion as Peshwa. The correspondence was intercepted by the ministers,\nand nineteen persons were sent into hill-forts; and the confinement of\nhis uncle would have become more rigid than ever, but Madhu Rao\nperceiving his death was certain, interposed, and observed it was natural\nfor his uncle to desire his liberty.\" He also states, that \"Raghunat'h\nRao was sent for to Tewur; that a reconciliation took place, and\nMadhu Rao, in presence of Sakaram Bapu (whom he had reinstated\nin the office of minister), recommended his brother Narayan Rao, the\n\n* In order to propitiate the gods, great men are weighed against gold, and the amount is\ndistributed in charity.\n\u2020 Vol. ii. page 241.\n\" heir presumptive, in an impressive manner, to the care and protection of\n\" his uncle.\"\n\nThe papers in my possession do not enable me either to contradict or\nconfirm this opinion, which, considering the extreme caution of the author\nin stating nothing but on good authority, is likely enough to be true.\n\nAmong those persons who were suspected of favouring Ragoba in his\nintrigues was Nana Farnevis's cousin Moraba, and it appears evident\nfrom the letters in Moraba's hand that the former accused him of betraying\nthe interests of his master the Peshwa. Early in the year Moraba had\nexplained to his cousin, in the following letter, for the first time, a feeling\nof animosity, which had long subsisted between him and the Peshwa's\nprivate secretary Har\u00ed Pant Farkia, and it seems from what ensued that he\nwas the person who communicated his suspicion of Moraba's intrigues with\nRagoba Dada.\n\nMoraba Farnevis to his cousin Nana.\n\n\" 26th of January 1772.\n\n\"I have received your letter regarding Har\u00ed Pant Farkia. The truth\nis, he and I have been on bad terms for the last three years; it is not a\nmisunderstanding of a single day, and it was owing to the want of\ncordiality that has so long existed between you and I, that I have not\nopened my mind to you before on this subject; but as I do not wish to\nconceal it any longer, I now write to you plainly. Notwithstanding our\nprivate feelings to each other, neither Har\u00ed Pant nor I have allowed\nthem to break out or to interrupt public business; but as he has now\nchosen to bring the circumstance forward, I candidly tell you that I ask\nno other umpire of our disputes than yourself, and in consequence of\nyour letter I have sent Naro Pant, who will explain how matters stand\nbetween us. There is one point, however, I beg of you to dismiss from\nyour mind, which is, a notion that my quarrel with Har\u00ed Pant originated\nin his being a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of yours. I call on the manes of my father and\nmother to witness that I have never allowed this circumstance to influence\nme for a moment. That we are not on good terms is quite true. For\nthis there are many causes, some of which I could mention, others I\nmust decline. Those concerning which I feel myself at liberty to speak,\nI will communicate when we meet. If you suppose, however, that Har\u00ed\nPant and I can ever act cordially together, I tell you once for all, it\nis impossible. This I can safely say on oath. But again I declare I have\n\"never allowed my private feelings to evince themselves in my manners or conduct towards him, nor will I ever do so. Naro Pant will explain every thing you wish.\"\n\nThe two following letters are without date, but they evidently refer to his intrigues with Ragoba about this period.\n\nMoraba to his cousin Nana Farnevis.\n\n\"Your letter has been received. It is positively true then that I am in the habit of communicating with Ragoba Dada, and that at such a time as the present, his Highness believes it! During the whole period of my administration, I saw Dada only five or six times, on which occasions Krishna Rao was almost always present. If I have ever seen or communicated with him since then, I am certainly guilty. If Dada has infringed the oath he took, and I have been accessory to it, let me be punished in any way his Highness pleases; or else let me go on some pilgrimage, when, if you please, you may send fifty or a hundred soldiers to look after me. Ragoba Dada has been my enemy since my birth. His minister, moreover, is my enemy. If his Highness the Peshwa reflects a little on these facts, he will himself discover how he has been deceived. Such, however, is the temper of the times. This was the only thing they could find against me. It is of no use to serve a master when all confidence is lost; so I beg of you to tell his Highness plainly, that he must assure me that his suspicions are removed before I return. If not, let him place a guard over me, and send me to live somewhere in retirement on the banks of the Godaveri. Either send me word to go at once, or let me be sent for to the presence, and I will come immediately.\"\n\nFrom the same to the same.\n\n\"The message communicated through Har\u00ed Pant, you no doubt conceive to be highly proper. Send one like it again, if you choose. Reflect, however, before you act. Consider the person and the proofs, and do not act on the word of any low fellow. But so it is. If I were suspected, you might have sent for, and accused me to my face. You should at all events have established something like proof before you acted, and then you might have done what you chose. This would have been worthy of the master you serve. Matters of this nature ought not to be done hastily.\"\n\nVol. II.\nFrom the same to the same.\n\n\"If accusation is to stand in the stead of proof, without any enquiry,\nwhat can be done? Under his Highness such has not hitherto been the\npractice; nor ought it to be so now. Some proof or evidence should\nsurely be adduced. There ought to be some regard for common justice;\nbut in this instance there is none. Very well, be it so. If you choose\nto send for me, do so. I conclude Har\u00ed Pant has told you all, but I\nhave had no reply from you.\"\n\nFrom the same to the same.\n\n\"I formerly gave the long agreement with Dada Sahib into the hands\nof Appaj\u00ed Pant, I now send the other agreement and another paper. It\ncan be of no use for me to retain these documents, under existing circum-\nstances. Let me know if anything important has occurred lately.\"\n\nAlthough the Peshwa was, on the whole, better during the rainy season,\nhe by no means thought he should recover; but he availed himself of his tem-\nporary convalescence to cause his will to be drawn up by his faithful friend\nNana Farnevis, and it still exists in his hand-writing. The following is a copy.\n\n\"Tcwur, 30th of August 1772.\n\n\"1. It is my wish that the whole of the cash in deposit with Madhaj\u00ed\nPant Guruji * be applied to the liquidation of the principal of the public\ndebt, and that the public money in hand be also applied to the same\npurpose.\n\n\"2. The inhabitants both of the Concan and the D\u00e9sh (upland country)\nhave suffered much on account of the revenues being farmed. I therefore\ndesire that those persons who have sustained injury by this measure, may be\nindemnified, after a minute investigation of the abuses which have taken\nplace, in order that justice may be done to my subjects.\n\n\"3. It was the wish of my revered father to obtain possession of Prayag\n(Allahabad) and Benares. I have always had the same desire. It is my\nwill, therefore, that these places may now be obtained, either by exchange\nor otherwise, as may be expedient.\n\n\"4. I beg that my venerable mother, who wishes to go to Benares to\nreside, may be permitted to do so.\n\n* This person was Madhu Rao's preceptor when he was a child; he afterwards became\nhis domestic priest; and was his private treasurer. The money in his hands was, in fact, the\nprivy purse which he bequeaths to the state.\n\"5. The Kriy\u00e1, or funeral ceremonies of Bhao Sahib (whose body was never found at Paniput) not having been performed, they should be fulfilled in the ensuing Magh (February). The widow, P\u00e1rwat\u00ed Bhy\u00e9, should be permitted to burn, if she chooses to do so.\n\n\"6. Let the annual charities at Benares be increased one-half, from this date.\n\n\"7. Let two hundred thousand Brahmins be fed at Benares on my account, and let each receive two pice (half-pence).\n\n\"8. Let a jagir of five lacs of rupees (\u00a350,000) annual revenue be assigned to my uncle Ragoba Dada, which may even be extended to seven lacs, if insisted on, but not more.\n\n\"9. Let the charities of Sr\u00e1wan-mas (month of August), at the P\u00e1rba\u1e6di (a temple near Poona), be always continued, even if the receipts of the government do not exceed five lacs of rupees (\u00a350,000).\n\n\"I swear by the holy Gan'apat\u00ed, that these are my wishes.\" (This line is in his own hand.)\n\nIn Nana's hand:\n\n\"I promise faithfully to fulfil, as far as is in my power, the wishes expressed in this document; though it is possible we may require money for political purposes in the mean time. I swear, however, I will fulfil what has been written, as far as is practicable. The public debt must be paid out of the public coffers as far they go; when, if a balance remains due, application will be made to Guruji for the deposit in his hands.\"\n\nAnother scrap of paper, in the hand-writing of Hari Pant Farkia, drawn up probably by his master's bed-side, is in existence, containing notes for the above, and stating that on no account is Ragoba's jagir to exceed seven lacs of rupees.\n\nTwo months and a-half after the date of Madhu Rao's will, that amiable, and I may add, illustrious prince, died, on the 18th of November 1772, in the twenty-eighth year of his age and the twelfth of his reign.\n\nAccording to the ordinances of the Hindu religion, his body was burned, and his fond wife, Rama Bhy\u00e9, to whom he was devotedly attached, ascended the funeral pile, evincing by her fortitude, in immolating herself with his body, a proof of the affection which she bore him. Her faith taught her to believe that this pious act would purge from sin the beloved object of her grief, and would ensure to them both an immediate and inseparable union in a future state.\nIt is, I think, impossible to read this interesting series of private documents, without confessing, that, in Europe, we are still but imperfectly acquainted with the natives of our eastern empire. Nay, I am of opinion, that until an European quits the British territory in India, where every Englishman looks on himself as a master, and on the people rather as his dependents than as his fellow subjects, it is extremely difficult for him to know much of their domestic habits, or private character.\n\nThe individuals who moved on the scene which has been exhibited in the letters I have translated, lived within our own time. Some of them even are now alive: and the facts, to which the correspondence alludes, are fresh in the minds of the present generation. It should be recollected also, that up to that period the court of Poona had had little or no intercourse with Europeans; so that the letters afford a fair sample of the materials which compose an Indian court, when left to itself. In this point of view, I consider these papers as singularly valuable and instructive; and, as historical records, very important.\n\nI would appeal to those members of the Society, who have heard the whole of this correspondence read, whether it be the production of a barbarous or uncivilized race? Whether the sentiments expressed in the letters, or the conduct of the individuals by whom they were written, exhibit a people deficient in talent, or different in any respect from what might be expected from persons considerably elevated in the scale of human society?\n\nIt has been my lot to pass a great part of my life in familiar intercourse with the natives of the east, and principally among those who have for the most part lived beyond the precincts of our jurisdiction, and my notions of them are drawn from such sources. I have found the people, generally speaking, intelligent in a very high degree, though, from education, deficient in the knowledge of European history and sciences. They, however, are ready to admit their ignorance, and desirous of instruction. They are usually liberal in their opinions; and the Hindus especially are tolerant on the subject of religion: for though tenacious of any interference in the exercise of their own, they oppose no worship or custom which does not affect themselves. Among their domestic virtues, I should class affection and tenderness to their relatives; kindness to their domestics; integrity in their dealings with each other; hospitality to strangers; and charity to the distressed and poor. Among the upper classes I have found refined notions of delicacy of conduct and manners; and among statesmen and financiers, I\nhave occasionally met with enlarged views of policy, and a knowledge of the principles of statistics and political economy, that would not disgrace the ministers of any government.\n\nI believe that at this moment, India contains natives who would do honour to any country: men who are capable of rendering themselves eminently useful to our government, not only by their intelligence and information, but by the weight which their influence would bring into our administration. They deserve to be more highly estimated, to be treated with more confidence, to be better rewarded, and to receive higher distinctions and consideration, than they usually meet with from us.\n\nThe eminent individual, who has just quitted the government of Bombay,* has endeavoured to promote the objects to which I have alluded; and I feel confident his successor will be disposed to tread in the same path; but, to have its full effect, the system must be general. If adopted, it seems to promise at no very distant period to bring about a revolution in the opinion of our Indian government among the natives, which it is of the utmost importance to effect. The more general employment of them in offices of trust will give respectability to the upper classes, which our present system is calculated to depress; it will elevate that branch of society which must always carry the body of the people along with it; it will give to it an interest in a government with which it will become identified; and, instead of exhibiting, as at present, a body of proud and broken-down families of rank, it will raise them to a respectable station in the community, which they will be unwilling to lose; and by giving them a greater degree of interest in the existence and welfare of the government, will strengthen it against internal commotion and foreign danger.\n\nIt would be presumptuous in me to expect that any sentiments of mine on such subjects should have much weight with the authorities with whom making these alterations must necessarily rest, even if I could venture to intrude them; but I look upon it as one of the most happy effects of our labours here, that by the diffusion of the knowledge of the state of society in the East, and of its institutions, a general acquaintance with these subjects will be spread throughout the public in England, and that the information brought home from India will, by being communicated through the pages of our Transactions, be a means of enlightening our countrymen, and of indirectly contributing to the happiness of many millions of the human race.\n\n* The Honourable Mountstuart Elphinstone.\nIX. On Hindu Courts of Justice. By Henry Thomas Colebrooke, Esq., Director R.A.S.\n\nRead May 24, 1828.\n\nThe composition of an Indian court of justice, conformably with the ancient Hindu institutions, being very imperfectly understood, and many erroneous notions having become prevalent on this subject, it appears to deserve a more full investigation than it has yet undergone; and, with this view, I submit to the Society the result of a careful perusal of original authorities of Hindu law relating to that point.\n\nThe following is an abstract,* from very ample disquisitions, contained in treatises of Indian jurisprudence.\n\nAn assembly for the administration of justice is of various sorts: either stationary, being held in the town or village; or moveable, being held in field or forest; or it is a tribunal superintended by the chief judge appointed by the sovereign, and entrusted with the royal seal to empower him to summon parties; or it is a court held before the sovereign in person. The two first of these are constituted at the request of parties, who solicit cognizance and determination of their differences; they are not established by operation of law, nor by the act of the king, but by voluntary consent. The two last are courts of judicature, established by the sovereign's authority: such a court is resorted to for relief as occasions occur, and not, as the first-mentioned, constituted merely for the particular purpose.\n\nTo accommodate or determine a dispute between contending parties, the heads of the family, or the chiefs of the society, or the inhabitants of the town or village, select a referee approved by both parties.\n\nAmong persons who roam the forest, an assembly for terminating litigation is to be held in the wilderness; among those who belong to an army, in the camp; and among merchants and artisans, in their societies.\n\n* A short extract from this treatise was communicated to Mr. H. St. George Tucker, for insertion in the Appendix to his work on the financial state of the East-India Company.\nPlaces of resort for redress are:\n\n1st. The court of the sovereign, who is assisted by learned Br\u00e1hmans as assessors. It is ambulatory, being held where the king abides or sojourns.\n\n2d. The tribunal of the chief judge (\"Pr\u00e1d viv\u00e1ca,\" or \"Dharm\u00e1dhyacsha\") appointed by the sovereign, and sitting with three or more assessors, not exceeding seven. This is a stationary court, being held at an appointed place.\n\n3d. Inferior judges, appointed by the sovereign's authority, for local jurisdictions. From their decisions an appeal lies to the court of the chief judge, and thence to the r\u00e1j\u00e1 or king in person.\n\nThe gradations in arbitration are also three:\n\n1st. Assemblies of townsmen, or meetings of persons belonging to various tribes, and following different professions, but inhabiting the same place.\n\n2d. Companies of traders or artisans; conventions of persons belonging to different tribes, but subsisting by the practice of the same profession.\n\n3d. Meetings of kinsmen, or assemblages of relations connected by consanguinity.\n\nThe technical terms in the Hindu for these three gradations of assemblies are, 1st. Puga; 2d. Sr\u00e9ni; 3d. Cula.\n\nTheir decisions or awards are subject to revision; an unsatisfactory determination of the \"Cula\" or family, is revised by the \"Sr\u00e9ni,\" or company, as less liable to suspicion of partiality than the kindred; and an unsatisfactory decision of fellow-artisans is revised by the \"Puga,\" or assembly of cohabitants, who are still less to be suspected of partiality. From the award of the \"Puga,\" or assembly, an appeal lies, according to the statutes of Hindu law, to the tribunal of the \"Pr\u00e1d-viv\u00e1ca,\" or judge; and, finally, to the court of the R\u00e1j\u00e1, or sovereign prince.\n\nThe \"Puga,\" \"Sr\u00e9ni,\" and \"Cula,\" are different degrees of arbitration, which, as is apparent, is not in the nature either of a jury or of a rustic tribunal, with which they have been assimilated; but merely a system of arbitration, subordinate to regularly constituted tribunals or courts of justice.\n\nI now proceed to the more detailed consideration of the composition of such courts.\n\nIn several passages of Hindu law books the members of the judicature are enumerated, but not without some discrepancy: one authority specifying so many as ten; others eight, but in some instances, nevertheless, noticing a greater number. The difference, however, is not material.\nThat enumeration concerns the sovereign court, wherein the king personally presides. The composition of subordinate tribunals, with respect to its members and attendants and officers, has not been particularized; nor are there any directions found concerning the manner in which the business of inferior courts is to be conducted, or the sittings of arbitrators. No doubt the analogy of the sovereign court would be followed, so far as applicable; and the composition of the highest tribunal would be the type or model for the construction of a subordinate one.\n\nA court of judicature is, in the passages which have been adverted to, likened to a body furnished with limbs; and the similitude of the members of the one and limbs of the other is followed out to a puerile minuteness. Without regard, however, to this solemn trifling, it may be observed, that the members enumerated are: first, the king or sovereign prince; next, the chief judge, or superintendent appointed by him; afterwards the assessors or puisne judges, considered in the aggregate as one member, though their number ought to be three, five, or seven. The written law is to be had for reference or consultation, and is mentioned as one member; gold and fire are also to be in readiness, for use in the administration of oaths, and are in like manner noticed as members; as is also water, provided for refreshment. The principal officers of the court, namely, the accountant, the scribe, and the sequestrator, complete the formal enumeration. But to these must be added, other officers and attendants of the court, as the summoner and the moderator; likewise the king's domestic priest or spiritual counsellor, and his ministers of state or temporal advisers; and also the audience or by-standers, comprehending qualified persons, any one of whom may interpose in the capacity of an *amicus curiae*; and persons in attendance to keep order and prevent the intrusion of the populace.\n\nBy the Hindu institutes, the administration of justice, civil and criminal, is among the chief functions of the *R\u0101j\u0101* or sovereign; not arbitrarily, according to his mere will and pleasure; but conformably with fixed laws recorded by ancient sages, and agreeable to the established custom of the country.\n\nHe will naturally need the assistance of learned persons conversant with those laws and usages, and competent to the application of them in particular and individual cases. There is need likewise of attendants and officers to conduct the process and execute the adjudications of the tribunal. The number, functions, and powers of those advisers and attendants, as\nprescribed by law, form the legal constitution of a Hindu sovereign court.\n\nIt is a topic considered and discussed in every general treatise of Indian forensic law: there is no occasion, therefore, for premising a disquisition on the authorities to which reference will be made.\n\n\u00a7 1. The sovereign Prince.\n\nThe Hindu sovereign in person hears litigant parties to redress injuries and decide their contests; or he devolves that office on a chief judge, whose duty it is to assist him when present, and to preside in his stead when absent. The right of personal superintendance is in strictness confined to the regular royal tribe of cshatriya, or to the br\u0101hman'a invested with sovereignty: one of an inferior class, whether the third or the fourth caste, or a mixed tribe, is not qualified to assume personal cognizance of causes, but is by law required to depute a judge to officiate in his stead. On this point, however, commentators of the law differ; some maintaining the competency of every sovereign, whatever be his tribe, for the personal exercise of judicial authority.\n\nIt is the sovereign on whom the duty of administering justice is incumbent. The chief judge, attendants, and officers, are only assistant in the trial of causes, like a stipendiary priest in the celebration of religious rites; and they possess no proper nor original jurisdiction. It is a positive obligation on him; and the attendance of the rest is not indispensable. The spiritual reward of a due administration of law, and the offence of its omission, concern him alone.*\n\nComposure and sedateness of demeanour, with simplicity of dress and ornament, are enjoined, lest the suitors of the court be overawed and confounded. A sitting posture facing the east is directed for a spiritual purpose; yet a trivial case may be heard by the prince standing; but he should not be walking to and fro, nor lying down, nor reclining. He holds out his right arm, wearing his mantle in the manner of a scarf, as is usual in an assembly of br\u0101hman'as, and having his hand free to make signs when there may be occasion so to do.\n\n\u00a7 2. The chief Judge.\n\nThe chief judge assists the prince when present, or presides in court\n\n* Sm. Chandric\u0101, &c.\nwhen he is absent. The proper title of this high officer is Pr\u0101d\u0101-viv\u0101ca, which signifies 'interrogator and discriminative pronouncer.' He questions the parties; investigates the case; distinguishes right and wrong; awards trial; and pronounces judgment. All this is implied in the title of his office. Another designation is Dharm\u0101dhyacsha, superintendent of justice. It occurs in the rubrick and colophon of divers treatises on law, as the author's official designation, especially in the works of Hel\u0101yudha.\n\nThe chief judge should be a br\u0101hma\u1e47a, observant of the duties of his tribe; conversant with the law in all its branches; skilled in logic and other sciences; acquainted with scripture and jurisprudence; and versed in holy literature, possessing conciliatory qualities, with many attainments. He should be gentle, not austere; deliberate, patient, and placid, yet firm; virtuous, wise, diligent, cheerful, impartial and disinterested; and, above all, sincere.\n\nBut, if a br\u0101hma\u1e47a duly qualified cannot be found, a man of the military class, or one of the commercial tribe (that is, a cshatriya, or a vaisya), who is conversant with jurisprudence, may be appointed chief judge: but not a \u015b\u016bdra, on any account, whatever be his knowledge and qualifications. This prohibition concerns spiritual consequences regarding the king's fortunes; it does not affect the validity of the \u015b\u016bdra's judicial acts.\n\n\u00a7 3. The Assessors.\n\nThe assessors of the court, appointed by the sovereign to assist the chief judge with their advice, or himself when presiding there in person, are three, five, or seven, not fewer than the less, nor more than the greater number mentioned; an uneven number being required, that, in case of disagreement, the opinions and votes of the majority may prevail, supposing their capacity and qualifications equal.\n\nThey should be br\u0101hma\u1e47as, versed in sacred and profane literature, conversant with jurisprudence, habitually veracious, and strictly impartial towards friend and foe; being honest, disinterested, and opulent; incorruptible, attentive to their duties, and devoid of wrath and avarice, and uninfluenced by other passions.\n\nIf br\u0101hma\u1e47as duly qualified cannot be selected, cshatriyas or vaisyas may be nominated; but not a \u015b\u016bdra by any means. The judicial acts of an incompetent or disqualified person are void, though they chance to be conformable with the law. In the instance of the chief judge, however,\nthe s\u00fadra's act is not void; neither should it be deemed so in the case of the assessor.\n\n\u00a7 4. The Audience.\n\nWriters on Hindu law reckon the audience as a component part of a court of justice; for a bystander may interpose with his advice, as the amicus curiae does in an European court.\n\nThis part of the audience consists of persons qualified to sit in court as assessors, being learned br\u00e1hman'as, conversant with law; not appointed to be assessors, but attending the court of their own accord, or upon their own affairs. Their interposition is not equally incumbent as it is on the assessors; nor is it called for, unless they possess such qualifications.\n\nA further part of the audience consists of persons attending the court to maintain order, and prevent the intrusion of the populace. They should be vais'yas, that is, persons of the third tribe, either merchants or husbandmen.\n\n\u00a7 5. The Domestic Priest, or Spiritual Adviser.\n\nThe king's domestic priest is regularly a member of the sovereign court of judicature. His nomination is specifically for the one object, as much as for the other: and it is his incumbent duty to check and restrain the king from wrong proceedings, no less in judicial than in religious matters. The nomination of one such priest being sufficient, no more than one is to be appointed. He should be a br\u00e1hman'a, versed in science, faithful, disinterested, diligent and veracious.\n\n\u00a7 6. Ministers of State.\n\nThe ministers of state attendant on the king, are reckoned among the component members of the sovereign court; or, the chief judge and the assessors or councillors, being selected from among the king's ministers and public servants, attend in those capacities, and are strictly members of the court.\n\n\u00a7 7. Officers of the Court.\n\nThe proper subordinate officers of the court are five, viz.\n\n1. Accountant;\n2. Scribe;\n3. Keeper of claims and enforcer of judgments;\n4. Messenger, or summoner of parties and witnesses;\n5. Moderator of the court.\n1. The requisite qualifications of the accountant are skill in computation, and a thorough acquaintance with every branch of mathematical knowledge, including astronomy (and even astrology), grammar, and other sciences, as well as sacred studies, and familiar knowledge of various modes of writing. He must be pure in conduct, and clearly deserving of trust.\n\n2. The like qualifications are required of the scribe. His diction must be unambiguous; his hand-writing fair: he must be honest, placid, disinterested, and veracious.\n\nBoth these officers should be of a regenerate tribe.\n\n3. The enforcer of judgment, and guardian of things claimed, may be a \u015b\u016bdra. He should be one who has been uniformly employed in the king\u2019s service; firm in conduct, but strictly obedient to the judges of the court. His functions are, the custody of things in dispute during the pendency of the cause, and the giving effect to the court\u2019s judgment.\n\n4. The messenger, or king\u2019s own officer, is one who has been long in his service, but is placed by him under the control of the judges, for the duty of summoning parties, holding them in custody, and seeking and calling their witnesses.\n\n5. Another officer is noticed, under the designation of moderator of the court, but with no other functions assigned to him besides the delivery of discourses on morality for the edification of the parties in suits, the judges, and the officers of the court.\n\n\u00a7 8. Conduct of Judges.\n\nPassages relative to the conduct of judges, their functions and duties, are very numerous in the institutes of Hindu law. These may not be without interest, collected and exhibited together for reciprocal illustration.\n\nIt will be obvious, from the frequent notice of the direct part taken by the sovereign in the administration of justice, and the manner in which this topic is weighed upon, that both when the institutes were written in the names of ancient sages, and when compilations were made from them by later authors, whose names are attached to works received as authority in divers countries of India, the Hindu sovereigns were accustomed to preside in their own tribunals, and take a personal and active share in the discharge of judicial duties.\n\nThe obligation of impartial justice incumbent on the sovereign and the judges, is earnestly inculcated, in language forcible and impressive. Careful\ninvestigation, a candid avowal of opinion, and strenuous remonstrance against unjust decisions, are strongly enjoined; and it appears from the whole tenour of numerous passages, that the monarch presiding in person determines the causes on his own responsibility. The assessors of the court merely offer advice, but have no voice or vote in the decision.\n\n\u00a7 9. Punishment of iniquitous Judges.\n\nIniquitous judges are punishable by fine, exile, and confiscation, for partiality, corruption, and collusion.\n\nThe fine is rated at twice the amount of the penalty to which the party cast would be liable; or, according to a different inference from the same law, twice the value of the thing litigated: but where this is not appreciable, the prescribed punishment is confiscation of property. This, however, is a controverted point; and the first-mentioned construction is the prevalent one. Confiscation extends to the whole property of the offender; and is awarded in a case of bribery; as is banishment also.\n\nIf the judge's iniquity be not discovered until after judgment has been passed, he is held bound in amends to make good to the aggrieved party the whole amount of his loss. Whether the cause shall be reheard, is a controverted point: one authority requiring revision of the judgment, and another directing that it shall not be disturbed, but amends made to the aggrieved party. This difference is grounded on a variation in the reading of the same text of law.\n\n\u00a7 10. Court-House.\n\nMinute directions are given concerning the situation and aspect of the court-house, and the decorations of the apartment in which the court is held. It will be sufficient to cite authorities on these points, without going into a discussion of unimportant questions arising out of them. It matters little whether the court-room should be an apartment of the royal palace or a separate edifice: nor does it much signify what are the proper and auspicious dimensions of a building designed for this purpose, according to Hindu notions of symmetry. The east is the prescribed aspect, whether the house be a distinct one, or contiguous to the palace.\n\n\u00a7 11. Time and mode of Sitting.\n\nThere is something curious, or approaching to it, as descriptive of ancient manners, yet not differing much from the habits of modern Hindu princes, in the minute directions given concerning the time when the courts should sit,\nviz. the forenoon, as most convenient; the hour at which the king should take his seat after early religious observances and ordinary preparations of the morning; the manner in which the members of the court are distributed, the king facing the east, the judges on the right, the scribe on his left, and the accountant facing him; and likewise concerning inauspicious days, on which courts should not assemble.\n\nTo this brief summary I annex a copious collection of passages relative to all points which have been here touched upon. It will be found to be full and sufficient on the whole subject, amply explaining the constitution of a Hindu sovereign court, its jurisdiction, original and appellate, and that of subordinate courts, and arbitration in several gradations. The topic is not without importance for its political bearing, as well as for illustration of Hindu manners.\n\nAPPENDIX.\n\n\u00a7 1. Resort for Redress of Wrongs.\n\n\"Bhrigu* ordained ten or else five places for the trial of causes, where litigant parties, involved in controversies, may obtain decisions.\n\n\"The frequenters of forests should cause their differences to be determined by men of their own order; members of a society, by persons belonging to that society; people appertaining to an army, by such as belong to the army; and the inhabitants of town [and country],\u2020 likewise by residents in both.\n\n\"Let the heads of the family, or the chiefs of the society, or the inhabitants of the city, or of the village, select an umpire, approved by both parties.\n\n\"The village, the townsmen, an assemblage of families, associations of artisans, and a scholar in the four sciences, persons belonging to the same class, allied families, heads of the family, constituted judges, and the king, [are the several judicatories.]\n\n\"Among persons who roam the forest, a court should be held in the wilderness; among those who belong to an army, in the camp; and among merchants, in their own societies.\u00a7\n\n\"'Men of their own order,' are persons abiding in the forest. From the term 'likewise,' which occurs in the text, it appears that they who reside in a town or village and\n\n* Or Menu, according to the Smriti Chandrica. \u2020 M\u0101dh.\n\u2021 Bhrigu, cited in Sm. Ch. and M\u0101dh.\n\u00a7 V\u1e5bhaspati, cited in Calpataru; C\u0101ty\u0101yana, in Vyavah\u0101ra Chint\u0101man\u012b.\nin the forest or wilderness, should cause their disputes to be adjusted by residents in both; that is, by persons abiding in the village and the forest [for they are conversant with disputes incident to both.*] The heads of the family are the chief persons among the kindred. The chiefs of the society are the leaders of a company assembled in a village, or on a pilgrimage, and so forth. The city signifies the principal town; the village, one inferior thereto: thus there is a distinction between the inhabitants of a city and of a village. The umpire, selected by the family, &c. completes the number of five resorts. They are suited to particular descriptions of persons, as foresters, &c.\u2020\n\n\"An assembly is of four sorts: stationary, moveable, graced by the signet, and governed by the institutes of law; the judges or arbitrators are as various. A stationary court meets in the town or village; a moveable one is assembled in the forest; one graced by the signet is superintended by the chief judge; one governed by the institutes of law is held before the king.\u2021\n\n\"The five first places of reference are adapted to particular descriptions of persons, as foresters and the rest. If a dispute arise among persons dwelling within the bounds of a village, it is determined by the inhabitants of the adjoining villages. The heads of families, the chiefs of societies, and the inhabitants of towns and villages, select an umpire approved by both plaintiff and defendant.\n\n\"The village and the rest are ten resorts common to all. The village intends people dwelling together in the manner of a hamlet. Townsmen are the whole of the inhabitants of a town. An assemblage (gan'a) is a set of families; for Ca'ta'ya'Yana says 'an assemblage of families is termed gan'a.' Associations denote washermen and the rest of eighteen low tribes. A scholar in the four sciences is a man conversant in logic and the rest of four requisite branches of knowledge. The conjunctive particle, which occurs in this place, indicates the association of such scholar with other learned persons; for Pitam'aha forbids the exposition of the law by one individual, however learned. Persons belonging to the same class (varga) are such as appertain to the same assemblage, and so forth; for Ca'ta'ya'Yana says, 'Vrihaspati declares, that assemblages of families and societies of heretics, companies of armed men, unions of low tribes, as well as other associated persons, are termed varga.' The authority of Vrihaspati is cited to show, that the term was already known in this acceptation. A company of armed men is a party of persons variously armed; for it is so explained by the same author. Families import such as are related to the plaintiff or to the defendant within the degree of sag\u00f3tra. Heads of families are elders sprung of the same kin with the plaintiff and defendant. Constituted judges are the chief judge with three assessors. The king, assisted by br\u00e1hman'as, &c. is last.\u00a7\n\n\"An assembly, which is held in the forest or other of three situations [first mentioned] is moveable; for, in general, it is suited to travelling. Among inhabitants of both town and country and other specified situations it is stationary, for it is not adapted to change\n\n* Viramitr\u00f3daya. \u2020 M\u00e1dh. in M\u00e1dhaviya.\n\u2021 Vrihaspati, cited in Sm. Ch., Culp. and M\u00e1dh \u00a7 D\u00e9v. Bh. in Sm. Ch.\nof place. One held at an appointed spot is graced by the signet; for it is attended by the superintendent or other officer holding the seal. But at the king's residence the court is one governed by the law; for it is precisely guided by the sacred institutes. This distribution of courts is shewn by the same author. The superintendent is the chief judge; for he is appointed by the king to try causes, and the royal seal is entrusted to him, that he may be enabled to summon defendants. This is implied in the text. The stationary and the moveable assemblies are specially constituted at the request of parties soliciting the meeting, with presents and other means of inducing consent; for such tribunals are not established by the mere operation of law, nor by the spontaneous act of the king. But a court graced by the signet, and one governed by the law, are established by the king of his own authority; therefore, to obtain a decision the court is resorted to, not constituted for the special purpose. The king's court, governed by law, is superior to all the rest.*\n\n\u00a7 2. Jurisdiction original and appellate.\n\n\"Judges appointed by the king, assemblies [of townsmen], companies [of artisans], and meetings [of kindred], must be understood to be superior, the one to the other, in order as here enumerated, for the decision of law-suits among men.\"\n\n\"Meetings [of kindred], companies [of artisans], assemblies [of co-habitants], an appointed judge, and the king himself, are resorts for the trial of law-suits; and, among these, the last in order is superior to the preceding.\"\n\n\"Persons who have been fully appointed by the king, the kindred of the parties, fellow-artisans, co-habitants, and others, may decide law-suits among men, excepting causes concerning violent crimes. Meetings of kinsmen, companies of artisans, assemblies of co-habitants, and courts of justice, are declared to be judicatories, to which he, against whom judgment is given, may successively resort. A cause, which has not been thoroughly investigated by the kinsmen, must be tried by persons of the same profession with the parties; one, which has not been well adjudged by fellow-artisans, should be revised by the townsmen; and what exceeds the compass of their understandings, must be heard by appointed judges. The members of a court of judicature are superior in jurisdiction to the kindred and the rest; the chief judge is superior to them; and the king is above all, since causes are always justly decided by him: for the intellect of the sovereign surpasses the understandings of others, in the trial of the highest, lowest, and mean controversies.\"\n\n\"The spiritual parent, the master, the family, the father, the eldest brother, and the grandsire, should try controversies among men, in matters to which they are competent.\"\n\n\"Litigants who have been before a previous tribunal, resorting, whether justly or unjustly, to the king, become plaintiffs [in appeal].\"\n\n\"One, who had been heard before the village, may appeal to the town; he, who has\n\n* D\u00e9v.

Ch.\nbeen before the town, may resort to the king; but one, who has been tried by the king, whether ill or well, has no further appeal.*\n\n\"A cause, which has been tried by the kinsmen, must be revised by successive judicatures, if either party be dissatisfied, until it be finally decided by the king. But they who pass decisions in law-suits without being properly authorized, are guilty of assumption of royal functions, and the king shall inflict punishment on them accordingly. Yet persons wearing the token [of a religious profession], companies [of artisans], assemblies [of co-habitants], merchants, and bodies of armed men, should always adjust their affairs according to their own laws.\"\n\n\"Among merchants, artisans, and the rest, as well as among such as subsist by agriculture, painting, and dyeing, since a decision cannot be passed by others, the king should cause their disputes to be adjusted by persons acquainted with the principles [of their calling].\"\n\n\"Husbandmen, mechanics, artists, men of a low tribe, dancers, persons wearing the token [of a religious order], and robbers or irregular soldiers, should adjust their controversies according to their own particular laws.\"\n\n\"The king should cause the disputes of men who practise austerity to be settled by persons conversant with three sciences, and not decide them himself, lest he rouse the resentment of adepts in illusion.\"\n\n\"Persons are appointed to try causes, according to the situation of the people concerned: the king and the society should adjust the matter conformably with justice. So B\u0101n\u0101r\u015bi ordains. He should cause the instruction [which shall determine the controversy] among men of the highest tribe, spiritual parents, venerable preceptors, and austere devotees, to be delivered by a person endowed with thorough knowledge.\"\n\n\"Let not a prince, who seeks his own good, pronounce the law among twice-born men, who dispute concerning affairs relative to the several orders: but let him, after giving them due honour, according to their merits, and first soothing them by mildness, apprise them of their duty with the assistance of br\u0101hma\u1e47as.\"\n\n\"Judges appointed by the king are persons authorized by him to try causes. Assemblies (puga) are meetings; companies are associations of persons subsisting by the same mechanical employments; families are societies of husbandmen. Among these, the first being superior to the last in order as enumerated, their relative authority in the trial of causes follows the same order. Therefore, when a cause has been tried by the family (cuta), if there be suspicion that it has been ill decided, a revision by the company of fellow artisans is proper. When it has been tried before the company (sr\u0113ti) the revision is by the assembly; or, tried before the assembly (puga), it is reviewed by the king's judges, and not conversely.\"\n\n---\n\n* Pit\u0101maha, cited in Sm.

An assemblage of persons of different classes is a company (sr\u00e9ni): one of persons of the same class is a family (cula). When these are appointed by the king for the decision of causes, the first respectively must be deemed superior to the latter; and this superiority is relative to appeal and revision. Thus, when a cause has been tried by an assembly, it must not be reheard by a company. By these several authorities causes may be tried, except such as concern violent crimes. So Vrihaspati declares.*\n\n\"Judges appointed by the king are members of a court of judicature nominated by the sovereign to administer justice. Assemblies are multitudes or meetings of persons belonging to different tribes and following different avocations, but inhabiting the same place, such as villagers, townsmen, or citizens. Companies are conventions of persons belonging to various tribes, but subsisting by the practice of the same profession, such as watchmen, dealers in betel, weavers, curriers, and the rest. Kindred signify meetings of relations connected by consanguinity. Of these four, namely, the king's judges and the rest, that jurisdiction which is here first mentioned must be deemed relatively 'superior,' or possessed of higher power 'for the decision of law-suits,' or trial of causes 'among men;' that is, between litigant parties. The meaning is, that in a cause decided by judges appointed by the king, the party that is cast cannot revive the suit before the townsmen and the rest, although he be dissatisfied, thinking the decision unjust. So, in a cause decided by the co-habitants, there is no resort to the fellow-artisans; nor, in one adjudged by them, to the kindred. But, if it were determined by the family, it may be appealed to the craft, and so forth. In like manner, if it be decided by the company of fellow-artisans, it may be appealed to the assembly; or if adjudged by the assembly, the next resort is to judges appointed by the king; and Na'reda declares, that in a suit tried by the king's judges, a further appeal lies to the king in person. Moreover, when he is resorted to, and the appealed cause, whereon a double amercement is staked, shall be decided by the king, aided by other assessors, together with the former judges, should the appellant be cast, he shall be amerced; or if he gain the cause, the former judges shall be fined.\n\n\"A cause tried by inferior judicatories may be appealed; but the judgment passed in a superior court cannot be reversed;\u2020 but Na'reda has declared that a decision passed by judges appointed by the sovereign, may be reversed before the king in person. Here the mention of king sub-denotes the chief judge; for he is superior in comparison with persons appointed by the sovereign. Therefore, a decision passed by persons so appointed, may be revised before the chief judge; and one by him adjudged may be rescinded before the king. Here, on appeal to the king, when a cause upon which an amercement is staked against the first judges is tried by the king, assisted by other assessors, should the appellant be cast, he shall be fined in a double penalty;\n\n* S'kla'p\u00e1vi in Dipacalica.\n\u2020 Ijy\u00e1n\u00e9s'wara, in Mit\u00e1cshar\u00e1 on Y\u00e1jnyawaleya, 1. 30.\nbut if he gain the cause on appeal, the original judges shall be fined, as the law provides. That will be explained in another place.\n\n\"Is not the trial of causes by townsmen and the rest impossible? How then can one jurisdiction be superior to another? For it may be asked, have they power to try causes in their own right, or by delegation from the king? The one supposition is not correct; for the appointment of a chief judge as assessor and representative of the monarch, and that of the spiritual advisers, the ministers of state, and judges as assessors only, is exclusively propounded. Nor is the other supposition right; for those only who are empowered to protect the people are invested with authority of inspecting judicial affairs: others, then, cannot possess that authority in their own right.\n\n\"It is thought that townsmen and the rest have power to try law-suits between merchants and others by the king's special appointment only, because it appears from texts of Vy\u0101sa, Vr\u012bhaspati, and others, that they are appointed assessors in the mode before explained.\n\n\"That is wrong. For if such were the case, the power of trying all causes would belong to the king and the chief judge exclusively, because no others could try suits without reference to them; and, since it is a maxim that denominations are taken from the principal object, the rule, that suits determined by kinsmen, &c. may be appealed, would be impertinent, for none could be determined by them. Townsmen and the rest could not themselves try a suit with delegated power, because it is forbidden to delegate judicial authority to \u015a\u016bdras; now the townsmen and the rest mostly belong to the servile class, and even to the lowest tribes of it, sprung in the inverse order of the classes.\n\n\"To all this the answer is, admitting that townsmen and the rest could not themselves try suits, still, in law-suits between merchants and the like, the charge is brought by persons of that description, and the king and the judge rely on such persons in deciding the cause. Taking their acts as the chief objects, the denomination may be fitly assumed from what is done by them. For the purpose of regulating the appeal, when a law-suit is recommenced, under a notion that it was ill decided, their consecutive authority is propounded by the text: else the precept would be irrelevant:\n\n\"But, in fact, townsmen and others, though persons to whom delegation of judicial authority is forbidden, are regenerated as to the cognizance of suits between fellow-townsmen and the rest; for a person to whom judicial power may be delegated, is not restricted by the texts of Vy\u0101sa and others to the cognizance of certain particular charges. Their power of themselves trying causes, like the chief judge, may therefore be affirmed. Consequently there is nothing impertinent. Moreover, Vr\u012bhaspati supports this very doctrine.*\n\n\"Kindred are relations of the parties. By the term 'and the rest' [in the text of Vr\u012bhaspati], companies and classes are meant. A company (\u015br\u0113\u1e47i) is a convention of merchants, and so forth. A class (gana), is an assemblage of priests, &c. Members of\n\n* Mitra mis'ra, in Viramitr\u014ddaya.\na court of justice are authorized judges. The chief judge is the superintendent of the\njudicature. Among these, including the king, the last in order has superior jurisdic-\ntion in the trial of causes, on account of pre-eminent knowledge.*\n\n\"The reason of the law is this: kindred and the rest, being related by consanguinity\nor other tie, may decide unjustly, through partiality or a like motive. An appeal, there-\nfore, lies to the king and other authorities, on alleging, with probable truth, that the\ncause had been ill decided. Fellow-artisans have superior jurisdiction above the kin-\ndred, because they are alien to the parties. But townsmen, though the single connexion\nof a common residence exist, have superior authority, because they are strangers to the\nparties, with no mutual relation, since they belong to different tribes and follow other\nprofessions. Persons appointed by the king, being still less connected with the\nparties, have jurisdiction above the co-habitants, because men appointed by the king,\nafter due examination, cannot be susceptible of the influence of partiality or the like\nmotives, since they are under awe of the sovereign. Assuredly, for the two reasons\nabove-mentioned, the chief judge, the domestic priest, and the ministers of state, have\nsuperior authority.

Conduct of Judges, &c.\n\nSince it is one of the functions of a sovereign to examine controversies in person, that duty is discharged by wise princes in the manner enjoined by law. Therefore should a king thoroughly guard his realm with care, by the due administration of justice, so will his wealth, virtue, and royal power be increased. Let him not side with either party, forgetting Yama's virtue of impartiality; but constantly inspect forensic affairs, banishing lustful and angry passions.\u00a7\n\n\"To him who decides causes according to justice, having subdued his lustful and angry passions, subjects flock as rivers flow to the sea. Like Yama, therefore, should the sovereign himself, forsaking favour and dislike, practise the virtues of self-command, having conquered his wrath and subdued all his passions.\u2016\n\n\"But a king, especially, who is careful to discharge his duty, must make strict inquiry to distinguish right from wrong, because human intellect is confused.

The sky seems to have a basis, and the luminary which shines in the heavens appears as fire; yet there is no base to the sky, nor fire in the celestial luminary. Hence it is right to examine a fact strictly, even though it occurred in the inquirer's own sight: he, who ascertains facts by rigid investigation, deviates not from justice. A king, thus constantly inspecting forensic affairs with attention, here passes through a region of glory, and hereafter reaches the splendid abode of the sun.\u00b6\n\n\"A prince thus practising vigilance in the due administration of justice, as ordained by law, here passes through a region of glory, and hereafter becomes a counsellor of Indra.*\"\n\n\"A king who acts with justice in defending all creatures, and slays only those who\n\n---\n\n* D\u00e9v.

Les cartes ne sont pas carr\u00e9es comme les anciennes\ncartes Chinoises ; elles ont la forme Europ\u00e9enne : je pense que c'est une\nimitation, car les missionnaires ne sont jamais all\u00e9s \u00e0 Sy-yu, et n'y ont\npas pu faire de carte. Je trouve des choses tr\u00e8s-obscur\u00e9es : mais je recueille\nles principaux traits. Le pays, dit-on, \u00e9toit anciennement tr\u00e8s-opulent :\navec beaucoup de royaumes, et une grande nombre de villes.

Je ne trouve rien de positif sur le caract\u00e8re et les m\u0153urs des\nhabitans, mais bien des faits annoncent qu'ils ne manque ni d'inter\u00eat ni\nd'\u00e9nergie. Ils sont pasteurs ; la quantit\u00e9 de leurs troupeaux, b\u0153ufs,\nmoutons, ch\u00e8vres, cachemires, chevaux renomm\u00e9s,* chamaux ou droma-\ndaires, est vraiment prodigieuse. Ils sont aussi cultivateurs, du moins\ndepuis que les colonies Chinoises s'y sont introduites. Beaucoup de\ncantons sont tr\u00e8s fertiles en riz, millet, et surtout en bled ; la farine\nest \u00e0 tr\u00e8s bas prix : ainsi que le chanvre, le coton, les raisins, les\nmelons : il y a une montagne toute couverte d'oignons (vide infra).\nEn g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, toutes les productions des climats temp\u00e9r\u00e9s sont en grande\nabondance. Les contributions se font en grains, cuivre rouge, et yu, cette\npierre si estim\u00e9e et d'un si grand usage en Chine : au reste, elles ne\nsuffisent pas aux frais de l'administration.\n\nLa conqu\u00eate de Sy-yu, qui a immortalis\u00e9 Kien-lung, lui a cout\u00e9\n\u00e9norm\u00e9ment en hommes et en argent : que d'efforts n'a-t-il pas fallu faire\npour charier des arm\u00e9es Chinoises \u00e0 plus de mille lieues par terre !

Les chefs, voisins de la Russie, tenoient des deux cot\u00e9s; les fronti\u00e8res n'\u00e9toient pas clairement design\u00e9es, et de temps en temps il survenoit des d\u00e9m\u00eal\u00e9s entre les deux puissances, qui se terminoient en faveur des Russes. L'ann\u00e9e derni\u00e8re, je lisois dans une gazette de Pekin que ces peuplades venant souvent piller les cultivateurs Chinois, l'empereur, pour faire la paix, accordoit une certaine quantit\u00e9 de millet, bled, etc. Ainsi les Chinois avouoient leur foiblesses; leurs adversaires sentoient leur force, et secou\u00e8rent le joug. Il en est r\u00e9sult\u00e9 une guerre terrible et tr\u00e8s dispensive pour la Chine. Les gazettes de Pekin ne parlent que de victoires; selon les bruits publiques, l'empire est en danger. Tout cela est exag\u00e9r\u00e9; voici des faits positifs, qui peuvent indiquer l'\u00e9tat actuel des choses. L'empereur envoie toujours force de troupes et d'argent: ainsi il reste encore beaucoup \u00e0 faire. Les revolt\u00e9s se defendent vigoureusement dans leur pays, mais ils ont fait peu de progr\u00e8s vers l'empire: Y-ly,* le chef lieu, est toujours en possession des Chinois. Je ne crois pas que la Chine puisse \u00eatre attaqu\u00e9e de ce c\u00f4t\u00e9: il faudroit franchir mille lieues et plus de deserts et de montagnes, et combattre les Chan-sinois et les Chen-sinois,\u2020 qui sont les meilleurs soldats de la Chine. Les Yuen qui ont conquis la Chine, venoient, en partie, de Sy-yu, mais ils se sont grossis des hordes Mongoux, et des transfuges Chinois; cependant les temps sont bien chang\u00e9s depuis cet \u00e9poque.\n\nLes revolt\u00e9s peuvent s'avancer plus facilement vers le Tibet, et les possessions Anglaises qui avoisinent le Tibet. C'est peut-\u00eatre leur projet, car, selon la gazette de Pekin il paroit que la province de Sze-tchouen a pris les armes. Au reste, il est prouv\u00e9 par l'histoire, qu'ils ne peuvent\n\n* This was the capital of the Muhammedan Tartars, previous to their conquest by Kien-lung; and the claim which their chief lately advanced to its independent possession, is said to have been the immediate cause of the war. Moorcroft speaks of the Chinese acquiring \"the state of Kashgar by the expulsion of the Musleman Khaja, whose heir, Jehangir Khaja, is now (1822) in attendance at the court of Omar Khan, the sovereign of Ferghana.\" (See the first volume of these Transactions, p. 55.) The Chinese call the Tartar chief Chang-kii-urh H\u00f6ct\u00f6, which is quite as near an approximation to Jehangir Khaja as most of their attempts at foreign names: Khaja or Khodjo, seems to be a common title of honour in Muhammedan Asia.\n\n\u2020 Inhabitants of the northern provinces of Shan-see and Shen-see.\n\"pas tenir contre la Chine; mais si, comme on le dit, ils sont aid\u00e9s des Russes, ils ne seront jamais soumis.\"\n\nIt appears, by later accounts in the Peking Gazette, that the war is concluded, at least for the present. The emperor declares, that as the principal places have been retaken, and the inhabitants returned to their submission (though the leader of the rebels has not fallen into his power), there is no farther occasion for the exertions of his troops. The real motives of his Imperial Majesty, in thus suddenly putting a stop to his military operations, and the real nature of the means by which this cessation of hostilities has been brought about, must for the present remain involved in considerable uncertainty. He may have reduced these Tartars to peaceful terms by the mere force of arms; or he may have ended a ruinous war by compliances and acts of compromise,* not altogether suitable to the dignity of the celestial empire, however these may have been coloured and misrepresented in the official bulletins. \"Proximis temporibus\" (says the historian of another overgrown empire, when speaking of other barbarians), \"triumphati magis quam victi sunt.\"\n\nThe neighbourhood of Chinese Turkistan to Cabul and its dependencies, induced me to refer to Mr. Elphinstone's valuable account of the latter kingdom, and I was at once struck by the resemblance between the costume exhibited in plate xii. of that work, and that which is represented in the pictures drawn by the Romish missionaries for the Emperor Kien-lung, in commemoration of his battles with, and victories over, the Hoey-hoey, or Muhammedan Tartars. The singular cap whose rim ends in two points, curved upwards both before and behind, is almost identical, and seems to prove some considerable connexion.\u2020 Mr. Elphinstone describes the subject of his twelfth plate as an individual of the Hazaurehs, a Muhammedam Tartar race, dependent on the King of Cabul, and inhabiting the mountainous country in the neighbourhood of Hindu Cush, or the Indian Caucasus, not very remote from the Chinese dependencies.\n\nIn comparing the itineraries of our own travellers, and the maps constructed from European accounts in general, with the Chinese map of Tartary, great difficulty arises from the awkwardness with which the latter conveys the sounds of foreign names. A few, however, are easily distinguishable, and the following may be given as examples:\n\n* The Gazette states that all the former contributions in grain are to be remitted.\n\u2020 See suite des seize estampes repr\u00e9sentant les conqu\u00eates de l'Empereur de la Chine, Planche xiv, etc.\nKih-shih-k\u00f6-urh \u5580\u4ec0\u5676\u723e Cashgar, or Kaush-kaur; concerning which Mr. Elphinstone remarks thus: \"The country of Kaushkaur must be carefully distinguished from Cashgar near Yarkand, in Chinese Tartary. I have endeavoured to mark the difference by retaining the spelling of our own maps for the first place, and giving that which is commonest in Afghanistan for the other; though, in fact, I have heard both called indiscriminately Kaushkaur, Kaushghur, and Kaushgaur. We found that the nearest Kaushkaur was an extensive but mountainous and ill-inhabited country, lying to the west of Budukshan, from which it was divided by Belut Tagh, having Little Thibet on the east, the Pamere on the north, and the ridge of Hindu Cush on the south. The country is high and cold; the inhabitants live chiefly in tents, though there are some towns. They belong to a nation called Cobi, of the origin of which I know nothing but what is suggested by the resemblance of their name to that of an extensive tract in Chinese Tartary.\"\n\nY\u00eb-urh-keang \u8449\u723e\u7f8c Yarkand.

Confucius sanctioned, by his countenance and adoption, the religious system which he found among his countrymen, and his works being the oldest extant, may, in this sense, be properly considered as the foundation of the Joo-kean, or state religion, which exists at present. He did not, however, himself originate or invent it, and indeed occasionally confesses the imperfection of his knowledge on such subjects. He was strictly a moral philosopher; and we should always keep distinct the system of ethics which he invented, and the system of worship which he merely left as he found it. The former is, for the most part, excellent; the latter, not very far removed above materialism. His imperial Majesty, as Pontifex Maximus, worships the heavens in one temple, the earth in another, the winds in a third; and every mountain and river throughout the country has its altar and its presiding genius. I have myself seen a market gardener (in his particular vocation) paying devout adoration to the fertile powers of the earth, under the semblance of a huge pebble-stone; the same circumstances of roundness and smoothness, which would have caused an English school-boy to select it for a missile, having led this poor Chinese to choose it as the object of his especial addresses.\n\nIf there be any meaning at all in the Chinese philosophy of the Yin and the Yang, it resembles more nearly the atomic system expounded by Lucretius, than any thing else I have ever met with; nor can I at all concur in an attempt, which has lately been made, to explain what is called the Tae-keih by a \"first cause;\" since it appears to be nothing more than some unintelligible beginning of material action. As the Chinese themselves seem unable to convey any clear notions on this profound subject, we might well be excused if we allowed it, without regret, to remain involved in its native and original obscurity.\nXI. Some Account of the Ruins of Ahwaz. By Lieutenant Robert Mignan, of the First Bombay European Regiment; with Notes by Captain Robert Taylor, Resident at Bussorah.\n\nRead June 14, 1828.\n\nIt having been my intention for some time to visit a few of the ruined cities whose decay has converted realms into desarts, and strewed the path of the shepherd with fragments of arches and pillars that once arose in majesty over heroic warriors, I set out in September 1826, for the purpose of examining the remains of the once celebrated city of Ahwaz, lying on the banks of the noble river Karun.\n\nAs there are only a few ruined villages (unworthy the traveller's and reader's notice) until its immediate vicinity is reached, I shall pass over the time that elapsed during my journey. It is sufficient to state that the whole country is a perfectly flat and uncultivated waste, abandoned by its former inhabitants to rapacious animals, and to still fiercer hordes of wild and ferocious Arabs, who occasionally pitch their flying camps here when in search of pasturage or plunder.\n\nPrevious to my quitting Bussorah I procured Kinneir's Geographical Memoir of the Persian Empire (the only book I have seen in our language that attempts any description of Ahwaz), as a guide and for reference.\n\nThe modern town of Ahwaz occupies but a small portion of the site of the old city, on the eastern bank of the Karun, and exhibits a mean and solitary appearance, contrasted with the immense mass of ruin that rears its rugged head behind. Its houses are built entirely of stone brought from the ruins, and it can only boast of one decent building, a mosque, apparently modern. The population at present does not exceed sixteen hundred souls. Considerable traces are discernible of the bund that was thrown across the river, chiefly, if not entirely, for the purposes of irrigation. A part of the wall is still standing, remarkable for its high state of preserva-\ntion; it is in many places ten feet high, and nearly as much in breadth; while it extends upwards of one hundred feet in length without any intermediate breach: indeed, on examination, I found many single blocks of stone in it measuring eight and ten feet. The river dashes over the bund with great violence, and accelerated by a strong current always running southwardly with rapidity, is projected into a fall, the sound of which is to be heard from a considerable distance. Boats of every description are obliged to discharge their goods previous to an attempt at passing over, and even then the passage is attended with much danger. I understood that they are frequently swamped. The river is one hundred and sixty yards in breadth at each side of the dyke, and of great depth; therefore the shallowness opposite the town is caused by the great mass of masonry below the surface. The remains of this bund are the portions which Kinneir appears to assign to the remnants of the palace of Artabanes. Upon what authority he asserts that any palace was erected across the river, or that it was the winter residence of Artabanes, the last of the Parthian kings, I am at a loss to discover. Kinneir also mentions that many of the excavations in the rocks bore the exact form and dimensions of a coffin: for these sepulchral recesses I looked in vain, although, towards the south end of the town, there are several singular cavities, and a few water-mills erected between the rocks, the latter probably constructed since his visit.\n\nThe remains of a bridge I found where he places it, namely, behind the town; and here too commences the mass of ruins, extending at least ten or twelve miles in a south-easterly direction, while its greatest breadth covers about half that distance. I could not find any person who had been to the end of these ruins; and according to the inhabitants, their extent would occupy a journey of two months. Although this is doubtless an exaggeration, it may be as well to mention, as an hypothesis, that they extend to the neighbourhood of Ram Hormis.\n\nAll the mounds are covered with hewn stone, burnt brick, and pottery. The first which I ascended I found to be nearly two hundred feet high. In many parts flights of steps are plainly discernible in good preservation, and at the base of this mass of ruins I dug into some graves, and found stones measuring five and six feet in length. Hence it was I brought away several stones with inscriptions upon them in the Cufic character, and others with fret-work, all indicative of an era subsequent to the Muham-\nmedan.* In every direction I met with vast heaps of circular flat stones perforated in the centre, apparently used for the purpose of grinding grain, though rather colossal for such a purpose, as they generally measured four, five, and six feet in diameter, and some exhibited characters upon them. The above-mentioned mound extends as far as the eye can reach, varying in height and breadth, and is the first in magnitude upon the plain. To the west of this is a mound entirely of stone, fifty feet high and twenty broad; here are several flights of steps, which may, without difficulty, be traced to its summit; although they are much mutilated, and injured by exposure to the atmosphere.\n\nAbout a mile to the east, separated by a deep ravine, stands an immense pile of materials, consisting of stone, brick, and tile of various colours. The Arabs who accompanied me called it the Kasr (\u0642\u0635\u0631), or palace. Its ascent is gradual but fatiguing, from the numerous furrows which have been apparently worn by water on its passage. The height is, at the lowest estimate, one hundred and fifty feet from the plain below. On the summit are many floorings of stone, as fresh as if only recently laid down; together with several rounded troughs, some of which were of Persepolitan marble in its rough state. From numerous cavities we started large flocks of jackals, and I found a number of porcupine quills strewed in every direction. I discovered that it was impossible to descend on the opposite side, as it was nearly perpendicular, and exhibited many frightful chasms. At the base of this mound the camel's thorn (\u0627\u0644\u062d\u062c\u0644 \u0634\u0648\u0643) is plentiful, and from its green appearance considerably relieved the landscape the general dreariness and sterility of which is gloomy beyond conception. The Kasr is about three miles from the east bank of the river. From this edifice I proceeded to a mound about half a mile distant in a north-westerly course. Its form was circular, measuring two hundred yards. At its base I traced a wall of masonry for twenty-one feet, the face of which is perfect and unbroken, and appears to have been the front of some building. The face opposite to that by which I ascended joins another ruined heap, covered with fragments of glazed tile, a coarse kind of crystal, pieces of alabaster, and bits of glass.\n\n* I believe Cufic coins have also been found in the ruins. I purchased a gold one, but will not vouch for its having been dug up there: it is nearly one thousand years old, and is as fresh in appearance as if just from the mint.\nSeveral mounds form one connected chain of rude, unshapen, flaked rock, lying in such naturally formed strata, that the very thought of any part of the materials having been accumulated by human labour from a distant site is scarcely admissible. The soil on which these ruins rest appears peculiarly soft and sandy; the country does not apparently become rocky until the immediate vicinity of Shuster, and even water-carriage from thence is attended with considerable toil and expense. Yet the height of these mountainous ruins and misshapen masses, induces me to admit the notion that the site was by nature elevated at the time the city was built, although from the flatness of the surrounding country I should be inclined to oppose such a conjecture; more particularly as I never heard of any mountains between the Shut-ul-Arab and the Bucktiani chain (which are to be seen from hence extending from the north-west to the south-east), nor do I believe there is a single hillock. Let me not be supposed to exaggerate when I assert, that these mountains of ruin, irregular, craggy, and in many places inaccessible, rival in appearance those of the Bucktiani chain, and are discernible from them, and for nearly as many miles in an opposite direction.\n\nIt is a singular fact, that almost every mound I passed over was strewed with shells of different sorts and sizes. I observed them also on the water's edge along the banks of the Karun; therefore we may suppose that at some former period the river, or more probably canals from it, flowed through the city. Glass of all colours is equally abundant, and the fragments of pottery are remarkably fresh.\n\nMany of the burnt bricks that lie on the surface of the mounds appear to have borne some written character; but exposure to the weather, and probably occasional inundations, caused by the melting snows of the adjacent mountains, have nearly effaced all traces of it; though, as I have already mentioned, the character on the hewn stone is as fresh and plain as if only just from the sculptor's hands. No bitumen was observable on the bricks, which I much regretted, as it would have afforded a strong proof of the antiquity of the spot.* The circular perforated stones that I have already alluded to appear in many places to have formed aqueducts, as I followed\n\n* I met with a few small intaglios, generally denominated seals, and probably used as such, similar to those found at and near Babylon; the villagers assured me they had procured them when digging for bricks, which I think is not unlikely.\nthem for a great distance in successive rows in small dry rivulets; and placed so firmly together, that it would have occupied the labour of several days to have removed any of them. The Arabs are always digging up and removing stones for the purpose of building, yet their expenditure has been nothing when compared to the vast quantities of stone and brick that are scattered about. Probably they have excavated a space of a hundred yards, but certainly to no greater extent: which is a proof how abundant the hewn stone is, for there is not a house in the town built of any other material. I am perfectly convinced that as large a city as any now existing might be erected from the ruins that I saw.* The ruins of Ahwaz extend also for a considerable distance on the west bank of the river in a northerly direction, exhibiting the same appearance as the mounds on the east side; though the former are not to be compared with these in point of magnitude. The bund that was thrown across appears to have nearly connected the city together; but as there is abundant room for conjecture, and much ground for idle supposition, it is better and wiser merely to state what is visible: this I have attempted to do, though perhaps with a feeble pen. Nevertheless, whatever our opinions may be regarding this once famous capital of a flourishing province, we must concur in ranking it lower in point of antiquity than either Persepolis or Susa, to say nothing of the mighty Babylon; or how could we persuade ourselves that Alexander the Great, strict and attentive in observation as enterprising and successful in war, should have navigated the Karun and have made no mention of the city, when comparatively insignificant towns attracted his notice. I repeat, it is my firm opinion and belief that this city, now one vast heap of ruins, was erected long since the days of the above-named illustrious warrior.\n\nTo conclude: it must ever be a subject of deep regret that the difficulty of exploring the remains of any spot of antiquity should be heightened by the passions of a people disposed to turbulence and riot. The desolation which, under the influence of a barbarous government, has for years been advancing over Susiana, one of the finest provinces of the east, whether as to soil and climate, or as to aptitude for commercial intercourse, irresistibly presses on the mind the mutability of earthly dignity; it made me tremble\n\n* I was prevented examining the other mounds, that extend to the verge of the horizon, from not being able to procure a horse or a mule, although I offered a large sum for the hire of one; most likely the Sheikh did not deem it safe, from the disturbed state of the country.\nfor the future fortunes of my native land, and effectually softened into compassion the disgust I might have entertained for the vicious and degraded people of this wilderness of desolation.\n\nROBERT MIGNAN.\n\nNOTES\n\nTO THE PRECEDING MEMOIR,\n\nBY\n\nCAPTAIN TAYLOR.\n\nIn forwarding to the Royal Asiatic Society the annexed description of the ruins of the ancient city of Ahwaz, situate ninety-two miles north-east of Bussorah, and forty-eight miles south of Shuster, which has been drawn up by Lieutenant Mignan, who has just returned from visiting them, I have been permitted to append the few remarks I could select on this subject from such Oriental manuscripts in my possession as appeared to be most worthy of confidence. As they are illustrative of a topic hitherto lightly touched, and consequently obscure, they can scarcely fail to interest from their novelty, though they might not fix the attention of the reader, from any great intrinsic importance.\n\nOf the foundation of this city I have it not in my power to assign the date. Its name occurs very early in the annals of Islam. The specimens of its architectural decoration, brought from the ruins by Lieut. Mignan, are decidedly Moslem, bearing inscriptions in no character but the early Cufic, nor language other than the Arabic: a remark equally applicable to the coins and gems usually found there; with the exception of a few small intaglios on cornelian or oriental onyx, the only evidences of an antiquity more remote than the era of Muhammed. All these circumstances would appear to lead to one of two conclusions: either that the remains now seen are those of a city founded by the first khalifs of the Ommiade dynasty, or that additions had been made to the edifices already erected by the Persians on a site older than the epoch of the advance and victories of the adherents of Islam. The zenith, however, of its prosperity was attained under the earlier khalifs of the house of Abb\u00e1s; nor did it long survive their fall.\nThe notice of the earliest date is extracted from the *Tolhaf-ul-Alem*, a modern work, composed for the information, and at the desire of the celebrated M\u00edr Alem of Hydrabad, by M\u00edr Abdul Sul\u00edr, a learned relative, and native of Shuster, the present capital of Susiana; it commences with an excellent general description of the province.\n\nEtymology also favours the view taken above: *Ahw\u00e1z* as well as *Hawaozeh*, another town of Kh\u00fazistan, the ancient Susiana, are two Arabic forms of one root. The earlier name of the former, according to Abulfeda, in his geographical tables, was *Humuzin Shehr*, strictly a Persian appellation, a compound too, evidently not of modern date; while the various districts of *Kh\u00faz* (whence *Susia* or *Ciassia*) were combined under the common name *Alahw\u00e1z*, and the capital was designated by the Arabic terms *Suz-ul-Ahw\u00e1z*, that is to say, the mart or emporium of *Al-Ahw\u00e1z*, or the districts.\n\nAccording to Samaani, as stated in his Biographical and Genealogical Dictionary, its pristine fame and prosperity no longer existed, any more than its proud palaces, and learned, luxurious, and wealthy citizens, in the middle of the twelfth century of our era.\n\nWith the exception perhaps of *S\u00edst\u00e1n*, no province of Persia is less known or more worthy of investigation than *Khuzist\u00e1n*. To the antiquary particularly it presents many objects of interest, in the ancient remains at *Ahw\u00e1z*, *Shuster* and *Degful*. It may also put forth the additional claim of possessing the last remnant of the Chaldees and Sabeans, the oldest people upon earth; the last depositaries, not improbably, of the earliest philosophical and theological systems of the human race; though, less fortunately, the originators also of its most complicated mythology and most degrading superstitions. The professors at once of the purest notions of unrevealed godhead; and the source of the impurest heretical leaven which has deformed Judaism, Christianity, or Muhammedanism. A considerable portion of their earliest literature is preserved; and it is not improbable that, with competent aid, their hitherto mysterious doctrines may be satisfactorily elucidated. I am, fortunately, in possession of their most important works, and of the valuable services of their chief priest: and have already translated some of the most interesting chapters of their *Sidd\u00e1 Rabb\u00e1*, or book of scriptures, entitled by the erudite and indefatigable Horbary \"Liber Adanni.\"\n\n\"I. The city of *Ahw\u00e1z* is one of the largest cities of the earth; and in \"Khuzistan, or indeed in the other kingdoms of the world, few are to be\nseen equal to it in size and extent. What are now thick and impervious woods, were once extensive plantations of sugar-cane. Large vats and manufactories of sugar were also in existence; and mill-stones and other implements of the art of the sugar-baker are even now so profusely scattered over the ancient site, that it is impossible to number them.\n\nDuring the dynasty of the Abbassides, this city was at the height of its prosperity. Its extent in breadth is supposed to be forty parasangs, throughout which ruins and remains of magnificent edifices, baths, caravans, and mosques, are strewed. Extensive as they may appear, the inhabitants were always in litigation regarding houses and ground, as spaces sufficiently open and ample could not be had for their accommodation. These khalifs, within whose dominions was comprehended most of the habitable world, named this city 'the source of food and wealth,' the inhabitants of which, in their riches and luxury, excelled the rest of the world.\n\nThe river of Dizipul, a stream nearly equal in size to that of the Kuran, enters this latter below Bandi Kir, and here the united waters are termed 'the river of Ahwaz.' The bund of Ahwaz restrained their course, so that the waters completely overflowed the land, and not a drop was lost to the aid of cultivation. The intermediate country was covered with plantations of sugar-cane; and the sugar was conveyed to every part of the world, as none of foreign manufacture was then imported into the territories of Persia or Rum. Thus the inhabitants became rich and luxurious, and renowned throughout the earth. As wealth, however, is the parent of pride and insubordination, these wealthy citizens revolted from the khalifs, until Ali Ebn Muhammed, the astrologer, surnamed 'prince of the Zaugis,' from having recruited his army among the Zaugis, or Nubian slaves of Khuzistan and Busrah, took the field with a powerful force, and contended for years against the monarchs of the house of Abbas. In the course of these hostilities the people served in the ranks of one or other of the rival armies, and were swept away in numbers by the chances of war; until, in the end, the khalifs triumphed. The rebellious spirit of the people, however, had so disgusted these princes, that they ceased to favour or embellish the city; and the remaining population, left to itself, fell into private feuds and bickerings. Anarchy and oppression ensued; the weaker fled, industry ceased, and with it the usual resort of commercial adventurers, and the production\nof wealth. The last poor remnant of this numerous, wealthy, and luxurious people, abandoned in despair their plantations and the other sources of their riches and destructive pride, and sunk into desolation.\n\nThe ruins are covered with heaps of stones and fallen masonry, and the inhabitants of the small modern town are repaid for their labours in searching among the ruins, after the periodical falls of rain, by the discovery of gold and silver coins, medals, and sculptures. Several gold coins of the Abbassides were shewn to me, while residing at Busrah, by an old inhabitant of Ahwaz. They have on one side an impression in the Cufic character, of the usual creed; on the margin of the other, the names of the four first khalifs; and in the central field the titles of Alhadir billah, A.H. 381. Skeletons are also not unfrequently disinterred. The heat of summer, and of the sammum, is here excessive.\"\u2014Tohfeet-ul-Alem, in vocem Ahwaz.\n\nII. Ahwaz is one of the largest districts of the province of Khuzistan. Its original name was Hormuzin Shehr. According to the authors of the Labab and Mushtauk, the name of the capital of the province is Suz-ul-Ahwaz, and that of the province Ahwaz, or Khuzistan. The greater part of the city is now in ruins. It is ninety farsangs from Ispahan.\"\u2014Abulfeda Jagwin-ul Bildan, Clim. 9, Art. 303.

Most of it is now in ruins, and little remains but a scanty population, and mounds and hillocks of earth and masonry, fragments of the former capital.\"\u2014Samaani Kitab-ul Aunab, in vocem Ahwaz.\n\nIV.

An Essay on the best Means of ascertaining the Affinities of Oriental Languages, by Baron William Humboldt, For. M.R.A.S. Contained in a Letter addressed to Sir Alexander Johnston, Knt., V.P.R.A.S.\n\nRead June 14, 1828.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to return you Sir James Mackintosh's interesting memoir. It possesses (like every thing which comes from the pen of that gifted and ingenious writer) the highest interest; and the ideas which are so luminously developed in it have the more merit, if we consider, that, at the period when this memoir was published, philosophical notions on the study and nature of languages were rarer and more novel than they are at present.\n\nI would, in the first place, observe, that the Royal Asiatic Society could not direct its efforts to a point more important, and more intimately connected with the national glory, than that of endeavouring to throw further light on the relations which subsist among the different Indian dialects. Since we cannot doubt that this part of Asia was the cradle of the arts and sciences at an extremely remote period, it would be highly interesting to ascertain with greater certainty whether the Sanscrit be a primitive idiom belonging to those countries, or whether, on the contrary, as most of the learned are at present inclined to believe, it was introduced as a foreign language into India; and if so, the country whence it originated would naturally follow in the course of inquiry. It is equally curious to determine whether the primitive languages of India are to be traced over the Indian archipelago in dialects differing little from each other, and whether we are to assign their origin to these islands or to the continent. Mr. Ellis's paper on the Malayalam language, with which you were so good as to furnish me, contains assertions on the affinity of the Tamul language to the idioms of Java, which it would be very important to verify.\nIt must be confessed that these problems are extremely difficult to solve; and it is probable that we shall never arrive at results which are quite certain: we should, however, carry these researches as far as possible, and the difficulty of the undertaking ought not to deter, but rather to induce us to select the most solid and certain means of insuring success. This is more particularly the point to which I wish to direct your attention, since you have been pleased to ask my opinion respecting the methods proposed by Sir James Mackintosh. It would assuredly have been very desirable to execute his plan, at the period when it was formed; we should then by this time have had more complete information regarding the languages of India; and should perhaps have been in the possession of dialects, of the existence of which we are now ignorant. There do exist, however, some works, such as Sir James calls for. Not to mention printed books, I have myself seen in the library of the East-India Company a MS. collection of Sanscrit words, compared in great numbers with those of the other languages of India, made under the direction of Mr. Colebrooke.(1) Some distinguished authors, as for instance Mr. Campbell, in his Telugu Dictionary, have been at pains to mark from what foreign idiom such words are derived, as are not proper to the language of which they form a part; and if these works do not embrace all the Indian idioms, they have, on the other hand, the advantage of comprehending entire languages, or at least of not being confined to a limited number of expressions. In the present state of our knowledge of the languages of India, which is very different from that of 1806, and possessing, as we now do, grammars and dictionaries of most of these idioms, I should not advise our confining ourselves to a plan which can only give a very imperfect idea of each of them. We can, and ought, to go farther at the present day. I confess that I am extremely averse to the system which proceeds on the supposition that we can judge of the affinity of languages merely by a certain number of ideas expressed in the different languages which we wish to compare. I beg you will not suppose, however, that I am insensible to the value and utility of these comparisons: on the contrary, when they are well executed, I appreciate all their importance; but I can never deem them sufficient to answer the end for which they have been undertaken; they certainly form a part of the data to be taken into account in deciding on the affinity of languages, but we should never be guided by them alone, if we wish to arrive at a solid, complete, and certain conclusion. If we would make\nourselves acquainted with the relation which subsists between two languages, we ought to possess a thorough and profound knowledge of each of them. This is a principle dictated alike by common sense and by that precision acquired by the habit of scientific research.\n\nI do not mean to say, that, if we are unable to attain a profound knowledge of each idiom, we should on this account entirely suspend our judgment: I only insist on it that we should not prescribe to ourselves arbitrary limits, and imagine that we are forming our judgment on a firm basis, while it is in reality insufficient.\n\nThe method of comparing a certain number of words of one existing language with those of several others, has always the two-fold inconvenience of neglecting entirely the grammatical relations, as if the grammar was not as essential a part of the language as the words; and of taking from the language which we wish to examine isolated words, selected, not according to their affinities and natural etymology, but according to the ideas which they express. Sir James Mackintosh very justly observes, that the affinity of two languages is much better proved when whole families of words resemble each other, than when this is the case with single words only. But how shall we recognize families of words in foreign languages, if we only select from them two or three hundred isolated terms? There undoubtedly subsists among words of the same language an analogy of meanings and forms of combination easy to be perceived. It is from this analogy, considered in its whole extent, and compared with the analogy of the words of another language, that we discover the affinity of two idioms, as far as it is recognizable in their vocabularies. It is in this manner alone, that we recognize the roots and the methods by which each language forms its derivatives. The comparison of two languages requires, that we should examine whether, and in what degree, the roots and derivative terms are common to both. It is not, then, by terms expressive of general ideas; such as sun, moon, man, woman, &c., that we must commence the comparison of two languages, but by their entire dictionary critically explained. The simple comparison of a certain number of words, by reducing the examination of languages too much to a mere mechanical labour, often leads us to omit examining sufficiently the words which form the subjects of our comparison; and to avoid this defect, we are forced to enter deeply into all the minutiae of grammar, separating the words from their grammatical affixes, and comparing only what is really essential to the expression of the\nidea which they represent. The words, of which we seek a translation in different languages, often cannot be rendered except by a compound term. Thus the sun in some languages is called the father, the author, the star, &c. of day. It is evident, that, in these cases, we no longer compare the same words, but words altogether different. To conclude: it is impossible to form a correct judgment on the resemblance of sounds without having carefully studied the system of sounds of each of the languages which we would compare. There occur often between different languages, and still more frequently between different dialects, regular transformations of letters, by which we can discover the identity of words that at first view seem to have but a very slight resemblance in sound. On the other hand, a great resemblance of sound in two words will sometimes prove nothing, or leave the judgment in great uncertainty, if it be not supported by a train of analogies for the permutation of the same letters. What I have remarked proves, as I think, that even if we confine ourselves to the comparison of a certain number of words in different languages, it is still necessary to enter more deeply into their structure, and to apply ourselves to the study of their grammar. But further, I am quite convinced that it is only by an accurate examination of the grammar of languages that we can pronounce a decisive judgment on their true affinities.\n\nLanguages are the true images of the modes in which nations think and combine their ideas. The manner of this combination represented by the grammar, is altogether as essential and characteristic as are the sounds applied to objects, that is to say, the words. The form of language being quite inherent in the intellectual faculties of nations, it is very natural that one generation should transmit theirs to that which follows it; while words, being simple signs of ideas, may be adopted by races altogether distinct. If I attach great importance, however, under this view, to the grammar of a language, I do not refer to the system of grammar in general, but to grammatical forms, considered with respect to their system and their sounds taken conjointly.\n\nIf two languages, such for instance as the Sanscrit and the Greek, exhibit grammatical forms which are identical in arrangement, and have a close analogy in their sounds, we have an incontestable proof that these two languages belong to the same family.\n\nIf, on the contrary, two languages do contain a great number of words in common, but have no grammatical identity, their affinity becomes a\nmatter of great doubt; and if their grammars have, like those of the Basque and the Latin, an essentially different character, these two languages certainly do not belong to the same family. The words of the one have been merely transplanted into the other, which has nevertheless retained its primitive forms.\n\nIf I assert that, in order to prove the affinity of languages, we should pay attention to the employment of grammatical forms and to their sounds taken together, it is because I would affirm that they must be considered not only in the abstract but in the concrete. Some examples will render this clearer.\n\nSeveral American languages have two plural forms in the first person, an exclusive and an inclusive form, according as we would include or exclude the person addressed. It has been thought that this peculiarity belonged exclusively to the American languages; but it is also found in the Mantchu, the Tamul, and in all the dialects of the South Sea Islands. All these languages have indeed this grammatical form in common; but it is only in the abstract. Each of them expresses it by a different sound: the identity of this form, therefore, does not furnish any proof of the affinity of these languages.\n\nOn the other hand, the Sanscrit infinitive, or rather the affixes \u0924\u0941\u0902 and \u0924\u0941, as in \u091c\u094d\u091e\u0947\u0924\u0941\u0915\u093e\u092e \u201cdesirous of vanquishing,\u201d correspond as grammatical forms with the Latin supines, and there is at the same time a perfect identity of sound in these forms in the two languages, as the Latin supines terminate invariably in tum and tu. The striking conformity of the Sanscrit auxiliary verb to that of the Greek and Lithuanian languages, has been ingeniously developed by Professor Bopp. The Sanscrit \u0935\u0947\u0926\u094d, the Greek \u1f64\u03b4\u03b7, and the Gothic vait, are evidently of the same origin. In all these three words there is a conformity both of sound and signification: but further; all the three verbal forms have these two peculiarities in common, that though preterites, they are used in a present sense, and that in all three the short radical vowel, which is retained in the plural, is changed to a long vowel in the singular. The Lithuanian weizdmi, I know, and the Sanscrit \u0935\u0947\u0928\u093f, shew clearly at first view that this word is not only the same in the two languages (as bos and beef in Latin and English), but that the two languages have, in the termination mi, modelled these words on the same grammatical form; for they not only mark the persons of the verb by\ninflexions added to the end of the root, but the affix of the first person singular is in both cases the syllable *mi*.\n\nThere is then in the examples adduced a conformity in grammatical use, and at the same time in sound; and it is impossible to deny that the languages which possess these forms must be of the same family.\n\nThe difference between the real affinity of languages, which presumes a filiation as it were among the nations who speak them, and that degree of relation which is purely historical, and only indicates temporary and accidental connexions among nations, is, in my opinion, of the greatest importance. Now it appears to me impossible ever to ascertain that difference merely by the examination of words; especially, if we examine but a small number of them.\n\nIt is perhaps too much to assert, that words pass from age to age and from nation to nation; that they arise also from connexions (which though secret, are common to all men) between sounds and objects, and that they thus establish a certain identity between all languages; while the manner of casting and arranging these words, that is to say, the grammar, constitutes the particular differences of dialects. This assertion, I repeat, is perhaps too bold, when expressed in this general way; yet I am strongly inclined to consider it correct, provided the expression *grammar* be not taken vaguely, but with a due regard to the sounds of grammatical forms. But whatever opinion may be entertained with respect to this manner of considering the difference of languages, it appears to me at all events demonstrated:\n\nFirst, that all research into the affinity of languages, which does not enter quite as much into the examination of the grammatical system as into that of words, is faulty and imperfect; and,\n\nSecondly, that the proofs of the real affinity of languages, that is to say, the question whether two languages belong to the same family, ought to be principally deduced from the grammatical system, and can be deduced from that alone; since the identity of words only proves a resemblance such as may be purely historical and accidental.\n\nSir James Mackintosh rejects the examination of grammar, for this reason, that languages which are evidently of the same stock have very different grammars. But we must not be misled by this phenomenon, although it is in itself quite true. The grammatical form of languages depends, on the\none hand, it is true, upon the nature of these languages; but it also depends, on the other hand, upon the changes which they experience in the course of ages, and in consequence of historical revolutions. Out of these changes it has arisen, that languages of the same family have a different grammatical system, and that languages really distinct resemble each other in some degree. But the slightest examination will suffice to shew the real relations which subsist between those languages, especially if by following the plan above laid down we proceed to the examination of forms which are alike identical in their uses and in their sounds. It is thus that we discover without difficulty that the English language is of Germanic origin, and that the Persian belongs to the Sanscrit family of languages, notwithstanding the very great difference which exists between the grammars of these idioms.\n\nIt is generally believed, that the affinity of two languages is undeniably proved, if words that are applied to objects which must have been known to the natives ever since their existence, exhibit a great degree of resemblance, and to a certain extent this is correct. But, notwithstanding this, such a method of judging of the affinity of languages seems to me by no means infallible. It often happens, that even the objects of our earliest perceptions, or of the first necessity, are represented by words taken from foreign languages, and which belong to a different class. If we only examine the list furnished by Sir James Mackintosh, we shall find there such words as people, countenance, touch, voice, labour, force, power, marriage, spirit, circle, tempest, autumn, time, mountain, valley, air, vapour, herb, verdure, and others of the same kind. Now all these words being evidently derived from the Latin, as it was transformed after the fall of the Roman empire, we ought, judging from these words, rather to assign to the English an origin similar to that of the Roman languages than to that of the German.\n\nIf what I have here advanced be well founded, it appears to me easy to point out the system which the Royal Asiatic Society would do well to pursue, in order to complete our knowledge of the Indian languages, and to resolve the grand problem which they present to the minds of philologists who endeavour to discover the origin and the filiation of languages.\n\nIt would be proper to commence by examining the country geographically, taking a review of every part of India, in order to know exactly in what parts we are still in want of sufficient materials to determine the\nnature of their idioms. Where deficiencies are discovered, efforts should be used for their supply, by encouraging those persons who are already employed on those languages, or may intend studying them, to form grammars and dictionaries, and to publish the principal works existing in these languages, for which every facility should be afforded them. If materials to a certain extent were thus collected, we should unquestionably not want men who would be able to deduce from them conclusions from which to prepare a critical view of the affinity of the Indian languages, and to determine, as far as the data which we might possess would admit, the manner in which the Sanscrit and other languages of India and its islands have reciprocally acted upon each other. I assume that the learned of the Continent would take their share in this work, M. E. Burnouf, of Paris, having already commenced a series of papers on the subject in the Nouveau Journal Asiatique.\n\nThere exists in England a vast quantity of manuscript materials relating to these languages. Dr. B. Babington, for instance, possesses alphabets altogether unknown in Europe up to the present time. In England, also, the great advantage is possessed of being able to direct works upon these languages to be undertaken in India itself, and to guide such labours by plans sent from this country. In India these are living languages, and literary men of the very nations in which they are spoken may be employed in the researches we wish to forward. No other nation possesses so valuable an advantage. It is important to profit by it. The deficiencies in our knowledge are numerous and evident. We possess scarcely any thing upon the Malayalim; and are in want of a printed dictionary of the Tamul. But while we keep this object strictly in view, and work upon a fixed plan, we shall insensibly fill up these vacancies. It is certainly difficult to find men who both can and will engage in a work like this, but they are undoubtedly to be found. Thus Dr. Babington has mentioned Mr. Whish to me, as being profoundly acquainted with the Malayalim, and as being already employed in making it better known in Europe. Solid labours upon languages are, in their nature, slow. In an enterprize so vast as that of examining to the utmost possible extent each of the numerous languages of India, progress can only be made insensibly and step by step. But learned societies afford this advantage, that the same labour can be continued through a long series of years; and complete and perfect works upon two or three idioms are certainly preferable to notions, more or less superficial, upon all the dialects\nof India, hastily put forth for the purpose of coming at once to a general conclusion.\n\nThese, Sir, are my ideas upon the subject, upon which you wished to have my opinion. It is only in compliance with your request, that I have ventured to lay them before you; for I am well aware how much better able the distinguished members of the Royal Asiatic Society are to form a judgment of, and give an opinion upon, this matter than I am.\n\nI request you, Sir, to accept the assurance of my highest respect.\n\n(Signed) Humboldt.\n\nLondon, June 10, 1828.\n\nNOTE.\n\n(1) The work to which allusion is made by Baron William de Humboldt, in the passage where I am named, was undertaken by me in furtherance of the views developed by Sir James Mackintosh. I thought that a more copious comparative vocabulary than he had proposed, would be practically useful; and would be instructive in more points of view than he had contemplated. Accordingly, at my instance, a Sanscrit vocabulary and a Persian one were printed with blank half pages, and distributed among gentlemen, whose situations were considered to afford the opportunity of having the blank column filled up, by competent persons, with a vocabulary of a provincial language. Vocabularies of the same vernacular tongue by a Pandit and a Munshi, would serve to correct mutually, and complete the information sought from them. Very few answers, however, were received: indeed scarcely any, except from Dr. Buchanan Hamilton. The compilation, to which Baron de Humboldt refers, comprises as many as I succeeded in collecting.\n\nH. T. C.\nXIII. Sketch of Buddhism, derived from the Bauddha Scriptures of Nip\u00e1l.\n\nBy Brian Houghton Hodgson, Esq., M.R.A.S.\n\nRead June 28, 1828.\n\nExtract of a Letter from Brian Houghton Hodgson, Esq.\nto Dr. Nathaniel Wallich.\n\n\"Nip\u00e1l, 11th of August 1827.\n\n\"Soon after my arrival in Nip\u00e1l (now six years ago), I began to devise\nmeans of procuring some accurate information relative to Buddhism:\nfor, though the regular investigation of such a subject was foreign\nto my pursuits, my respect for science in general led me cheerfully\nto avail myself of the opportunity afforded, by my residence in a\nBauddha country, for collecting and transmitting to Calcutta the\nmaterials for such investigation. There were, however, serious\nobstacles in my way, arising out of the jealousy of the people in\nregard to any profanation of their sacred things by an European, and\nyet more, resulting from the Chinese notions of policy adopted by this\ngovernment. I nevertheless persevered; and time, patience, and\ndexterous applications to the superior intelligence of the chief minister,\nat length rewarded my toils.\n\n\"My first object was to ascertain the existence or otherwise of Bauddha\nScriptures in Nip\u00e1l; and to this end I privately instituted inquiries in\nvarious directions, in the course of which the reputation for knowledge\nof an old Bauddha residing in the city of P\u00e1tan, drew one of my people\nto his abode. This old man assured me that Nip\u00e1l contained many large\nworks relating to Buddhism; and of some of these he gave me a list.\nSubsequently, when better acquainted, he volunteered to procure me\ncopies of them. His list gradually enlarged as his confidence increased;\nand at length, chiefly through his kindness, and his influence with his\nbrethren in the Bauddha faith, I was enabled to procure and transmit\nto Calcutta a large collection of important Bauddha scriptures.\"\n\"Meanwhile, as the P\u00e1tan Buddha seemed very intelligent, and my curiosity was excited, I proposed to him (about four years ago) a set of questions, which I desired he would answer from his books. He did so; and these questions and answers form the text of the paper which I herewith forward. The reason why I have so long kept it to myself, is, that with the lapse of time my opportunities for obtaining information increased; and I at length persuaded the sensible minister of this state to permit my old friend to visit me. Having in his answers quoted sundry sl\u00f3kus in proof of his statements; and many of the scriptures whence these were taken being now in my possession, I was tempted to try the truth of his quotations. Of that, my research gave me in general satisfactory proof.\n\nBut the possession of the books led to questions respecting their relative age and authority; and, tried by this test, the Buddha's quotations were not always so satisfactory. Thus one step led to another, until I conceived the idea of drawing up, with the aid of my old friend and his books, a sketch of the terminology and general disposition of the external parts of Buddhism, in the belief that such a sketch, though but imperfectly executed, would be of some assistance to such of my countrymen as, with the books only before them, might be disposed to enter into a full and accurate investigation of this almost unknown subject.\n\nWhen, however, I conceived that design, I little suspected where it would lead me; I began ere long to feel my want of languages, and (to confess the truth) of patience, and almost looked back with a sigh to the tolerably full and tolerably accurate account of Buddhism which I had obtained so long ago, and with little comparative labour, from my old friend's answers to my queries. I also saw certain notices of Buddhism coming from time to time before the world, ushered by the talents and industry of Klaproth and Remusat; and, so far as I had opportunity to learn what these notices contained, it seemed that the answers to my questions furnished much ampler and more accurate views of the subject than these distinguished men could extract from their limited sources of information.\n\nThese considerations have induced me to present, without further delay, the accompanying paper to Mr. Colebrooke, to whose sound knowledge if it be first submitted, there can be no danger of the publication being made without sufficient warrant for its usefulness. Whether or not I shall persevere in the undertaking before hinted at, I can hardly venture to say;\"\nbut from the larger information latterly collected by me with a view to its completion, I have drawn some notes in correction or enlargement of the paper now transmitted, and have placed them on its margin.\n\nI add to this letter a very considerable list of the Baudhha scriptures in general, extracted for me from those still existing in Nip\u00e1l.\n\nOf so many of those scriptures as I have procured and sent to Calcutta I have furnished to the Asiatic Society of Bengal a meagre explanatory catalogue. Of the rest I can obtain here only the names; and, as it would be useless to repeat what has been already said of some of these books, I forward the present list, without further observation on it, than, that its accuracy may be relied on, and that its contents are so far from being local to Nip\u00e1l, that the largest portion of the books neither are, nor ever were procurable in this

There are a few repetitions in this list: the cause of which is, that the list is composed of literal extracts from the catalogues subjoined to sundry independent scriptures.\n\nWhen I stated, in the letter which accompanies these papers, that this list might be relied on, I ought to have restricted the expression to the enumeration of names simply: for the classification of its nomenclature (as pur\u0101\u1e47as, tantras, &c.) is the work of my old friend, and is doubtfully deducible from the authority of his books.\n\nWhat I have gathered on the subject of the arrangement of generic and specific titles of the Baudh\u0101 scriptures, I have stated to the Asiatic Society of Calcutta. Suffice it here to say, that S\u016btra and Dharma are the most general titles of Buddhist works of religion; and that the Baudh\u0101 equivalents for the Brahmanic Pur\u0101\u1e47a and Tantra seem to be Vy\u0101karana, and Upad\u0113sa.\n\nB. H. Hodgson.\n\nExtract of a Letter from Brian Houghton Hodgson, Esq.\nto Dr. Nathaniel Wallich.\n\n\"Nip\u00e1l, 17th October 1827.\n\n\"In a clever paper in the first and second numbers of the Calcutta Quarterly Oriental Magazine (Review of the Bombay Literary Transactions), it is said that one of the distinctions between Jainism and Buddhism is, that the Jaina statues are all naked, and the Baudh\u0101 statues all clothed. The pictures now sent you * are proofs that this notion is false. You see too that my Baudh\u0101 images are called Digambara, a name heretofore fancied to be peculiar to Jainism; this is another error, and were this the place for dissertation, I could bring forward many other presumptions in favour of\n\n* See Plate I, fig. a. b.\nthe notion that the Jainas are sectarian Bauddhas, who dissented from their Bauddha brethren merely in carrying to a gross excess, and in promulgating publicly, certain dangerous dogmas, which the more prudent Bauddhists chose to keep veiled from all but the initiated. The Nip\u00e1l Bauddhists are very jealous of any intrusion into their esoteric dogmas and symbols; so much so, that though I have been for seven years enquiring after these things, my old Vajra Ach\u00e1rya friend only recently gave me a peep at the esoteric dogmas; and my Chitrak\u00e1r (Bauddha though he be) has only within these last twelve months brought me some esoteric pictures: nor probably should I have got at these secret things at all, if I had not been able to examine the Bauddha books, in some small degree, myself; and if a Bh\u00f3tiya had not put into my hands a picture containing one of these naked saints. With these decisive means of questioning in my power, I at last got my Bauddha assistants to draw up the veil of the sanctuary, to bring me copies of the naked saints, and to tell me a little of the naked doctrines.\"\n\nExtract of a Letter from Brian Houghton Hodgson, Esq.\nto Dr. Nathaniel Wallich.\n\n\"Nip\u00e1l, 1st November 1827.\n\n\"I cannot just now go into a description of the significance of all the details of the sculptures which I have sent. Suffice it to say, that every part of each image is significant; and that the differences between the five are marked, first, by the different position of the hands (which is called the m\u00fbdra); secondly, by the variety of the supporters; thirdly, by the variety of the cognizances placed between the supporters; and fourthly (where painting and colours are used), by difference of colour. Vairchana's appropriate colour is white; Aksh\u00f3bhya's, blue; Ratna-Sambhava's, yellow, or golden; Amit\u00e1bha's, red; and Amogha-Siddha's, green.\"*\n\nExtract of a Letter from Brian Houghton Hodgson, Esq.\nto Henry Thomas Colebrooke, Esq., Dir. R.A.S.\n\n\"I beg to present you with the accompanying sketch of Buddhism. There are a few matters connected with it, which it may be advisable to state to you; and in the first rank stands the authority upon which I\n\n* See Plate I, fig. c, d, e, f, g.\nhave assigned the meaning of intellectual essence to the word Buddha,\nand that of material essence to the word Dharma. The Bauddhas define\nthe words thus: 'B\u00f3dhan \u00e1tmak\u00e1 iti Buddha; Dh\u00e1r\u00e1n \u00e1tmak\u00e1 iti Dharma.'\nAbout the former of these definitions there can be no difficulty; there\nmay concerning the latter. To the word Dh\u00e1rana, or holding, containing,\nsustaining (from the root dhr\u0325), I have assigned a material sense; first,\nbecause it is opposed to b\u00f3dhana; secondly, because the goddess Dharma,\nthe pravrittika personification of this principle, is often styled, in the\nmost authentic books, 'Prakrit\u00e9swari,' the material goddess, or goddess\nof matter; and thirdly, because this goddess is (under the names\nDharma, Praj\u00f1y\u00e1, Ary\u00e1 T\u00e1r\u00e1, &c.) in very many passages of old\nBauddha works, described as the material cause of all things; conform-\nably, indeed, with that bias towards materialism, which our heretofore\nscanty knowledge of Buddhism has led us to assign to the Saugata faith.\nSanga, the third member of the Triad, belongs not to the exalted\nstate of nirv\u00e1tti, in which no sect of Bauddhas admits more than two\nprinciples of all things, or matter and mind, Buddha and Dharma. Sanga\nis defined 'Sam\u00fadayi \u00e1tmak\u00e1 iti Sangya,' the multitudinous essence; be-\ncause multitude is held to be as strong a characteristic of pravritt\u00ed, or the\npalpable world, as unity is of the world of nirv\u00e1tti, or abstraction.\nIn note 31, I have distinctly rejected the fifth order of Bandyas, or\nVajra Ach\u00e1ryas, in opposition to my old Bauddha friend's statement in the\ntext of the Sketch. There can be no doubt that my friend is mistaken:\nfor in many high authorities, the four original and true orders of Bandyas\nare called by the collective name of the 'Chat\u00far Varna,' and are therein\ndescribed without mention of the Vajra Ach\u00e1ryas. It may serve to\nexplain my friend's statement, to tell you that he is himself a Vajra\nAch\u00e1rya; and that as the genuine monachism of Buddhism has long\nsince passed away in Nip\u00e1l, sundry local books have been composed here\nby Vajra Ach\u00e1ryas, in which they have made their own modern order\nco-equal with the four ancient orders; and my old friend would hold\nthese modern Nip\u00e1l books sufficient warrant for the rank ascribed to his\nown class. I have lately spoken to him on this subject, and he has con-\nfessed that there is no old authority for his fifth order of Bandyas. In\nmy note I have endeavoured carefully to separate Buddhism as it is (in\nNip\u00e1l) and Buddhism as it ought to be, quoad this point of classification.\nIf you look into Kirkpatrick's and Buchanan's works on Nip\u00e1l, you will\n\"see how they have been puzzled with the difference of things as they are\n\"from what they ought to be, in those casual and erroneous hints which\n\"they have afforded on the subject of Buddhism.\n\n\"In note 15, I have stated that the K\u00e1rmikas and Y\u00e1tnakas entertained\n\"tolerably just views on the grand subject of free-will and necessity; and\n\"I believe I am therein essentially correct: for how otherwise are we to\n\"understand their confession of faith, 'the actions of a man's prior births\n\"'are his destiny?' Exclude the metempsychosis, which is the vehicle of\n\"the sense of this passage, and we have our old adage, 'Conduct is fate:'\n\"a law of freedom surely.\n\n\"Still, were I cross-examined, I might be forced to confess, that the\n\"ideas which the K\u00e1rmikas and Y\u00e1tnakas entertain of free-will, seem to\n\"resemble rather the qualifications of our Collins and Edwards, than the\n\"full and absolute freedom of Clarke and the best European philosophers.\n\n\"The K\u00e1rmikas and Y\u00e1tnakas seem to have been impressed with the fact\n\"of man's free-will, but to have been perplexed in reconciling such a\n\"notion with the general spirit and tendency of the old Swabh\u00e1vica phi-\n\"losophy. But in the result, the K\u00e1rmikas and Y\u00e1tnakas seem to have\n\"adhered to free-will, though perhaps in the qualified sense above men-\n\"tioned.\"\n\nSKETCH OF BUDDHISM.\n\nQUESTION I.\nHow and when was the world created?\n\nANSWER.\nAccording to the S\u00e1mbh\u00fa Pur\u00e1na, in the beginning all was void (s\u00fanya).\nThe first light that was manifest was the word Aum; and from this Aum\nthe alphabet was produced\u2014called Mah\u00e1 Varna, the letters of which are\nthe seeds of the universe. (See note 1.) In the Guna K\u00e1randa Vy\u00e1ha it\nis written, when nothing else was, S\u00c1MBH\u00da was; that is the self-existent\n(Swayambh\u00fa); and as he was before all, he is also called Adi Buddha. He\nwished from one to become many, which desire is denominated Prajnya.\nBuddha and Prajnya united became Prajnya Up\u00e1ya, as Siva Sakti, or\nBrahma M\u00e1ya. (See note 2.) In the instant of conceiving this desire, five forms\nor beings were produced, called the five Buddhas (see note 3), whose names\nare as follows: Vair\u00f3chana, Aksh\u00f3bhya, Ratna-Sambhava, Amit\u00e1bha, Amogha-Siddha.* Each of these Buddhas, again, produced from himself, by means of Dhy\u00e1n, another being called his B\u00f3dhi-Satwa, or son. Vair\u00f3chana produced Samant-Bhadra; Aksh\u00f3bhya, Vajra-P\u00e1ni; Ratna-Sambhava, Ratna-P\u00e1ni; Amit\u00e1bha, Padma-P\u00e1ni; and Amogha-Siddha, Viswa-P\u00e1ni.\u2020\n\nOf these five B\u00f3dhi-Satwas, four are engrossed with the worship of S\u00e1mbh\u00fa (Savayambh\u00fa), and nothing more is known of them than their names; the fifth, Padma-P\u00e1ni, was engaged, by S\u00e1mdh\u00fa\u2019s command, in creation (see note 4); and having, by the efficacy of S\u00e1mbh\u00fa\u2019s Dhy\u00e1n, assumed the virtues of the three Gunas, he created Brahm\u00e1, Vishnu, and Mah\u00e9sa, and delegated to them respectively creation, preservation, and destruction. Accordingly, by Padma-P\u00e1ni\u2019s commands, Brahm\u00e1 set about creating all things; and the Chat\u00far-y\u00f3ni (or oviparous, viviparous, &c.) came into existence by Brahm\u00e1. The creation of Brahm\u00e1, Vishnu, and Mah\u00e9sa by Padmi-P\u00e1ni, is confirmed by the sloca (see note 5), the meaning of which is, \u2018Kamali (Padma-P\u00e1ni) produced Brahm\u00e1 for creating, Vishnu for preserving, and Mah\u00e9sa for destroying.\u2019 And the creation of Brahm\u00e1 is six-sorted, viz. D\u00e9va, Daitya, M\u00e1nusha, &c.; and, for the D\u00e9vas, Brahm\u00e1 made heaven; and for the Daityas, P\u00e1t\u00e1la; and the four remaining kinds he placed between these two regions and upon the earth.\n\nWith respect to the mansions (l bhuvanas) of the universe, it is related, that the highest is called Agnishtha Bhuvana; and this is the abode of A\u2019di-Buddha. And below it, according to some accounts, there are ten; and according to others, thirteen Bhuvanas (see note 6); named, Pram\u00f3dita, Vimal\u00e1, Prak\u00e1kar\u00ed, Archishmati, Sudurjaya, Abhimukhi, D\u00farangama, Achala, S\u00e1dh\u00e1matt, Dharmam\u00e9gha (x), Samant-prabh\u00e1, Nir\u00fapan\u00e1, Jny\u00e1navat\u00ed (xiii). These thirteen Bhuvanas are the work of A\u2019di-Buddha; they are the B\u00f3dhi-Satwa-Bhuvanas; and whoever is a faithful follower of Buddha will be translated to one of these mansions after death.\n\nBelow the thirteen B\u00f3dhi-satwa Bhuvanas are eighteen Bhuvanas, called collectively R\u00fapya Vachara. These are subject to Brahm\u00e1, and are named individually: Brahma-k\u00e1yik\u00e1, Brahma-p\u00far\u00f3hit\u00e1, Brahma-prash\u00e1dy\u00e1, Mah\u00e1 Brahman\u00e1, Parit\u00e1bh\u00e1, Apram\u00e1n\u00e1bh\u00e1, Abh\u00e1sward\u00e1, Parita-subh\u00e1, Subha-\n\n* See Plate I, fig. c, d, e, f, g.\n\u2020 See Plate II, fig. g, h, i, k, l.\n\u2021 By et c\u00e6tera always understand more Brahmanorum.\nkishn\u00e1, Anabhrak\u00e1, P\u00fanya-prasav\u00e1, Vrihat-ph\u00fal\u00e1, Arangi-satw\u00e1, Avrih\u00e1, Apay\u00e1, Sudrish\u00e1, Sudarsan\u00e1, and Sum\u00fakh\u00e1. Pious worshippers of Brahm\u00e1 shall go to one of these eighteen Bhuvanas after death.\n\nAnd below the eighteen mansions of Brahm\u00e1, are six others subject to Vishnu, called collectively K\u00e1ma-Vachar\u00e1, and separately as follows: Chat\u00far-Mah\u00e1-r\u00e1ja-K\u00e1yik\u00e1, Trayastrins\u00e1, T\u00fashita, Yam\u00e1, Nirm\u00e1navat\u00ed, Paranirm\u00edt\u00e1-V\u00e1savarti. And whosoever worships Vishnu with pure heart shall go to one of these.\n\nAnd below the six Bhuvanas of Vishnu are the three Bhuvanas of Mah\u00e1d\u00e9va, called generally A'r\u00e1pya-Vachar\u00e1, and particularly as follows: Abh\u00f3g\u00e1-Nitya-yatn\u00f3pag\u00e1, Vij\u00f1\u00e1ya-yatn\u00f3pag\u00e1, Akinchanya-yatn\u00f3pag\u00e1; and these are the heavens designed for pious Siva-M\u00e1rgis. Below the mansions enumerated, are Indra Bhuvana, Yama Bhuvana, S\u00farya Bhuvana, and Chandra Bhuvana; together with the mansions of the fixed stars, of the planets, and various others which occupy the space down to the Agni Bhuvana, also called Agni-k\u00fand. And below Agni-k\u00fand is Vayu-k\u00fand; and below Vayu-k\u00fand is Prithvi, or the earth; and on the earth are seven Dwipas, Jamb\u00fa Dwipa, &c.; and seven S\u00e1garas or seas, and eight Parvatas or mountains (see note 7), Sum\u00e9ru Parvata, &c. And below Prithvi is Jala-k\u00fand, or the world of waters; and the earth is on the waters as a boat. And below the Jala-k\u00fand are seven P\u00e1talas, as Dharani, &c.: six of them are the abodes of the Daityas; and the seventh is Naraka, consisting of eight separate abodes: and these eight compose the hell of sinners: and from the eighteen Bhuvanas of Brahm\u00e1 down to the eight chambers of Naraka, all is the work of Manj\u00fasri. Manj\u00fasri is by the Bauddhas esteemed the great architect, who constructs the mansions of the world by A'di-Buddha's command, as Padma-P\u00e1ni, by his command, creates all animate things.\n\nThus Manj\u00fasri (see note 8) is the Visva-karma of the Bauddhas; and is also the author of the sixty-four Vidy\u00e1s.\n\n**Question II.**\n\nWhat was the origin of mankind?\n\n**Answer.**\n\nIt is written in the narrative portion of our Tantras, that originally the earth was uninhabited. In those times the inhabitants of Abh\u00e1svara Bhuvana (which is one of the Bhuvanas of Brahm\u00e1) used frequently to visit the earth, and thence speedily to return to Abh\u00e1sward. It happened\nat length, that, when a few of these beings, who, though half males and half females, had never yet, from the purity of their minds, conceived the sexual desire, or even noticed their distinction of sex, came, as usual, to the earth, A'di-Buddha suddenly created in them so violent a longing to eat, that they ate some of the earth, which had the taste of almonds, and by eating it they lost their power of flying back to their Bhuvana, and so they remained on the earth. They were now constrained to eat the fruits of the earth for sustenance; and from eating these fruits they conceived the sexual desire, and began to associate together: and from that time, and in that manner, the origin of mankind commenced from the union of the sexes. (See note 9.)\n\nWhen the beings above-mentioned came last from Abh\u00e1svar\u00e1, Mah\u00e1 Samvat was their leader, and he was the first king of the whole earth.\n\nIn another Tantra it is written, that A'di-Buddha is the immediate creator of all things in heaven and earth.\n\nWith respect to time we conceive the Satya-yuga to be the beginning of time, and the Kali-yuga the end of it: and the duration of the four yugas, the particulars of which are found in the Brahmanical scriptures, have no place in our's: in which it is merely written that there are four yugas; and that in the first, men lived 80,000 years; in the second, 10,000; in the third, 1,000: and the fourth is divided into four periods; in the first of which, men will live 100 years; in the second, fifty years; in the third, twenty-five years; and in the fourth, when the close of the Kali-yuga is approaching, seven years only; and their stature will be only the height of the thumb; and then all things will be destroyed, and A'di-Buddha alone remain: and this period of four yugas is a Pralaya. A'di-Buddha will then again create the four yugas, and all things else to live in their duration, which when completed, all things will be again destroyed, and thus there will be seventy-one pralayas, or completions of the four yugas, when Maha Pralaya will arrive. How many revolutions of the four yugas (i.e. how many pralayas) have now passed, and how many remain to revolve, is nowhere written.\n\n**Question III.**\n\nWhat is matter, and what spirit?\n\n**Answer.**\n\nBody (see note 10), which is called Sar\u00edra and D\u00e9ha, was produced from the five elements and soul, which is called pr\u00e1na and jiva, and is a particle of\nthe essence of A'di-Buddha. Body, as created out of the elements, perisheth: soul, as a particle of the divine spirit, perisheth not; body is subject to changes\u2014to be fat and lean, &c.; soul is unchangeable. Body is different in all animals; soul is alike in all, whether in man or any other creature. But men have, besides pr\u00e1na, the faculty of speech, which other animals have not; according to the sloca, of which the meaning is this: \"D\u00e9ha is derived from the five Bh\u00fatas, and J\u00edva from the Angas of Swayambh\u00fa.\" (See note 11.)\n\n**Question IV.**\n\nIs matter an independent existence, or derived from God?\n\n**Answer.**\n\nBody, according to some, depends upon the inhaling and exhaling of the Pr\u00e1na-V\u00e1yu; and this inhalation and exhalation of the breath is by virtue of the soul (pr\u00e1na), which virtue, according to some, is derived from God, and according to others (see note 12), is inherent in itself: there is much diversity of opinion on this subject. Some of the Buddhama\u00f1g\u00eds contend that d\u00e9ha (the body) is Swabh\u00e1vaka; i.e. from the copulation of males and females, new bodies proceed; and they ask who makes the eyes, the flesh, the limbs, &c. of the foetus in the mother's womb? Swabh\u00e1va! And the thorns of the desert, who points them? Swabh\u00e1va! And the timidity of the deer kind, and the fury of the ravenous beasts, whence are they? from Swabh\u00e1va!\n\nAnd this is a specimen of their reasoning and proofs, according to a sloca of the Buddha-charita-k\u00e1vy\u00e1. (See note 13.) Some again say, that d\u00e9ha and sans\u00e1ra are Aishwarika (see note 14), i.e. produced by Isw\u00e1ra, or A'di-Buddha, according to another sloca.\n\nSome again call the world and the human body K\u00farmika, i.e. that Karma is the cause of this existence of d\u00e9ha and sans\u00e1ra; and they liken the first d\u00e9ha to a field (ksh\u00e9tra), and works to a seed. And they relate, that the first body which man received was created solely by A'di-Buddha; and at that time works affected it not: but when man put off his first body, the next body which he received was subject to Karma, or the works of the first body (see note 15); and so was the next, and all future ones, until he attained to M\u00fakti and M\u00f3ksha: and therefore they say, that whoever would be free from transmigration must pay his devotions to Buddha, and consecrate all his worldly goods to Buddha, nor ever after suffer such things to excite his desires. And, in the Buddha-Charita-K\u00e1vy\u00e1 it is written, that\nwith respect to these points, S\u0101ky\u0101 expressed the following opinion: \"Some persons say that Sams\u0101ra is Swabh\u0101vak\u0101, some that it is K\u0101rmik\u0101, and some that it is Aiswarik\u0101 and \u0100tmak\u0101; for myself, I can tell you nothing of these matters. Do you address your meditation to Buddha; and when you have attained Bodhijny\u0101na, you will know the truth yourselves.\"\n\n**Question V.**\n\nWhat are the attributes of God?\n\n**Answer.**\n\nHis distinctive attributes are many; one of which is, that he is Panchjny\u0101n\u0101tmaka (see note 16), or in his essence are five sorts of jny\u0101na, possessed by him alone, and which are as follows: first, Suvisuddha-Dharma-Dh\u0101tuja; second, Adarsan\u0101ja; third, Pratyav\u0113kshan\u0101ja; fourth, Samt\u0101ja; fifth, An\u016bshth\u0101n\u0101ja. The first created beings, Vair\u014dchana, &c., were in number five, owing to these five jny\u0101nas; and in each of these five Buddhas is one of the jny\u0101nas. Another of \u0100di-Buddha's attributes is the faculty of individualizing, and multiplying himself, and again individualizing himself at pleasure: another is, possessing the qualities of passion and clemency.\n\n**Question VI.**\n\nIs the pleasure of God derived from action or repose?\n\n**Answer.**\n\nThere are two modes of considering this subject: first, according to nirv\u1e5btti; and, secondly, according to prav\u1e5btti.\n\nNirv\u1e5btti (see note 17) is this: to know the world to be a mere semblance, unreal, and an illusion; and to know God to be one: and Prav\u1e5btti is the opposite of this sublime science and is the practice and notions of ordinary men. Therefore, according to nirv\u1e5btti, \u0100di-Buddha is the author and creator of all things, without whom nothing can be done; whose care sustains the world and its inhabitants; and the moment he averts his face from them they became annihilated, and nothing remains but Himself. But some persons, who profess nirv\u1e5btti, contend that the world with all it containeth is distinct from \u0100di-Buddha: yet the wise know this to be an error. (See note 18.)\n\n\u0100di-Buddha, though he comprehends all living things, is yet one. He is the soul, and they are but the limbs and outward members, of this monad. Such is nirv\u1e5btti, which, being deeply studied, is found to be unity; but\npravritti, which is multiplicity, may be distinguished in all things. And in this latter view of pravritti, A'di-Buddha may be considered a king, who gives orders; and the five Buddhas, and other divinities of heaven, his ministers, who execute his orders; and we, poor mortals, his subjects, servants, and slaves. In this way the business of the world is distributed among the deities, each having his proper functions; and A'di-Buddha has no concern with it. Thus the five Buddhas give mukti (see note 19) and moksha to good men: Brahma, by the orders of Padma-Pani, performs the part of creator; Vishnu, by the same orders, cherishes all beings; and Maha Deva, by the same orders, destroys; Yama takes cognizance of sins, and punishes sinners; Indra and Varuna give rain; and the sun and moon fructify the earth with their rays; and so of the rest.\n\n**Question VII.**\n\nWho is Buddha? Is he God, or the creator, or a prophet or saint; born of heaven, or of a woman?\n\n**Answer.**\n\nBuddha means, in Sanscrit, the wise; also, that which is known by wisdom; and it is one of the names which we give to God, whom we also call A'di-Buddha, because he was before all, and is not created, but is the creator: and the Pancha Buddhas were created by him, and are in the heavens. Sakyas, and the rest of the seven human Buddhas* are earth-born or human. These latter, by the worship of Buddha, arrived at the highest eminence, and attained Nirvana Pad (i.e. were absorbed into A'di-Buddha). (See note 20.) We therefore call them all Buddhas.\n\n**Question VIII.**\n\nWhat is the reason for Buddha being represented with curled locks?\n\n**Answer.**\n\nA'di-Buddha was never seen. He is merely light. (See note 21.) But in the pictures of Vairochana, and the other Buddhas, we have the curled hair; and since in the limbs and organs we discriminate thirty-two (lacshanas) points of beauty, such as expansion of forehead, blackness of the eyes, roundness of the head, elevation of the nose, and archedness of the eye-brows; so also the having curled locks is one of the points of beauty and\n\n---\n\n* See Plate IV, fig. f.\nand there is no other reason for Buddha's being represented with curled locks. (See note 22.)\n\n**Question IX.**\n\nWhat are the names of the great Buddha? Does the Newari language admit the word Buddha, or any substitute for it? and what is the Bh\u00f3tiya name for Buddha?\n\n**Answer.**\n\nThe names of A'di-Buddha are innumerable: Sarvajnya, Sugata, Buddha, Dharma-R\u00e1ja, Tath\u00e1gata, Bhagav\u00e1n, Samant-Bhadra, M\u00e1raj\u00edta, L\u00f3kaj\u00edta, Jina, An\u00e1dinidh\u00e1na, A'di-Buddha, Nirandhaka, Jny\u00e1naika-chaksh\u00fa, Amala, Jny\u00e1na-M\u00farti, V\u00e1ch\u00e9s'wara, Mah\u00e1-V\u00e1di, V\u00e1dir\u00e1ta, V\u00e1dip\u00fangava, V\u00e1disinha, and Paraj\u00e1t\u00e1. Vair\u00f3chana, and the other five Buddhas, have also many names. Some of Vair\u00f3chana's are as follows: Mah\u00e1-D\u00edpti, Jny\u00e1na, Jy\u00f3tish, Jagat-pravr\u00edtti, Mah\u00e1t\u00e9jas, &c.; and so of the other four. Padma-P\u00e1ni also has many names, as, Padma-P\u00e1ni, Kamali, Padma-Hasta, Padma-Kara, Kamala-Hasta, Kamalakara, Kamal-P\u00e1ni, Ary\u00e1val\u00f3kit\u00e9s'wara, Ary\u00e1val\u00f3k\u00e9swar, \u00c1vl\u00f3kites'war, and L\u00f3ka-N\u00e1tha. (See note 23). Many of the above names are intercommunicable between the several persons to whom they are here appropriated. Buddha is a Sanscrit word, not Newari: the Bh\u00f3tiya names I do not know; but I have heard they call S\u00e1kya Sinha, Sungi Th\u00faba: Sungi meaning the deity, and Th\u00faba his Alaya or Vih\u00e1r.\n\n**Question X.**\n\nIn the opinion of the Banras, did God ever make a descent on earth? if so, how often; and what is the Sanscrit and Newari name of each Avat\u00e1ra?\n\n**Answer.**\n\nAccording to the scriptures of the Buddhama\u00f1g\u00e1s, neither A'di-Buddha nor any of the Pancha Buddha Dhy\u00e1ni (see note 24), ever made a descent; that is to say, they were never conceived in mortal womb; nor had they father or mother; but certain persons of mortal mould have by degrees attained to such excellence of nature and such B\u00f3dhijny\u00e1na, as to have been gifted with divine wisdom, and to have taught the B\u00f3dhi-charya and Buddhama\u00f1ga, and these were seven, named: Vipasya, Sikhi, Viswa-Bh\u00fa, Kark\u00fatchand, Kanakam\u00fani, K\u00e1syapa, S\u00e1kya-Sinha.\n\nIn the Satya-yuga were three: Vipasya, who was born in Vind\u00famati Nagar, in the house of Vind\u00fam\u00e1n R\u00e1ja; Sikhi, in Urna D\u00e9sa; and\nVisvadh\u00fa, in An\u00fapam\u00e1 D\u00e9sa, in the house of a Kshatriya; in the Tr\u00e9t\u00e1-yuga, two persons became Buddhas; one Kark\u00fatchand, in Ksh\u00e9m\u00e1vati Nagar, in the house of a Brahman; the other Kanaka Muni, in S'ubh\u00e1vati Nagar, in the house of a Brahman: and in the Dwapar-yuga, one person named K\u00e1syapa, in V\u00e1r\u00e1nasi Nagar, in the house of a Brahman: and in the Kali-yuga, S\u00e1kya, then called Sarv\u00e1rttha Siddha (see note 25), in the house of Sudh\u00f3dana R\u00e1ja, a S\u00e1kyavansi, in the city of Kap\u00e1lavast\u00fa, which is near Gang\u00e1s\u00e1gar, became Buddhas. Besides these seven, there are many illustrious persons; but none equal to these. The particular history of these seven, and of other Buddhas, is written in the Lalita Vistara. (See note 25.)\n\n**Question XI.**\n\nHow many Avat\u00e1ras of Buddhas have there been, according to the Lamas?\n\n**Answer.**\n\nThey agree with us in the worship of the seven Buddhas, the difference in our notions being extremely small; but the Lamas go further than this, and contend that themselves are Avat\u00e1ras. I have heard from my father, that, in his time, there were five Lamas esteemed divine: the names of three of them I have forgotten, but the remaining two are called Sh\u00e1murpa and K\u00e1rmapa.\n\n**Question XII.**\n\nDo the Lamas worship the Avat\u00e1ras recognized by the N\u00e9w\u00e1rs?\n\n**Answer.**\n\nThe Lamas are orthodox Buddhama\u00fargis, and even carry their orthodoxy to a greater extent than we do. Insomuch, that it is said, that S\u00e1nkara A'ch\u00e1rya, S'iva-M\u00e1rgi, having destroyed the worship of Buddha and the scriptures containing its doctrine in Hindusthan, came to Nip\u00e1l, where also he effected much mischief; and then proceeded to Bh\u00f3te. There he had a conference with the grand Lama. The Lama, who never bathes, and after natural evacuations does not use topical ablution, disgusted him to that degree, that he commenced reviling the Lama. The Lama replied, \"I keep my inside pure, although my outside be impure; while you carefully purify yourself without, but are filthy within:\" and at the same time he drew out his whole entrails, and shewed them to Sankara; and then replaced them again. He then demanded an answer of Sankara. Sankara, by virtue of his y\u00f3ga, ascended into the heavens; the Lama\nperceiving the shadow of Sankara's body on the ground, fixed a knife in the place of the shadow; Sankara directly fell upon the knife, which pierced his throat and killed him instantly. Such is the legend or tale that prevails, and thus we account for the fact; the Buddhama\u1e45g\u012b practice of Bhote is purer, and its scriptures more numerous, than ours.\n\n**Question XIII.**\n\nWhat is the name of your sacred writings, and who is their author?\n\n**Answer.**\n\nWe have nine Pur\u0101\u1e47as, called \"the nine Dharmas.\" (See note 26.) A Pur\u0101\u1e47a is a narrative or historical work, containing a description of the rites and ceremonies of Buddhism, and the lives of our chief Tath\u0101gatas. The first Dharma is called Prajna Pramita, and contains 8,000 slocas. This is a Ny\u0101ya \u015a\u0101stra, or work of a scientific character, capable of being understood only by men of science; the second is named Ganda Vy\u016bha, of 12,000 slocas, which contains the history of S\u016bdhana K\u016bm\u0101ra, who made sixty-four persons his gurus, from whom he acquired B\u014ddhij\u00f1\u0101na; the third, is the Sam\u0101dhi R\u0101ja, of 3,000 slocas, in which the nature and value of japa and tapas are explained; the fourth is the Sanc\u0101vat\u0101r, of 3,000 slocas, in which is written how R\u0101vana, lord of Lank\u0101, having gone to Malayagiri mountain, and there heard the history of the Buddhas from S\u0101kya Sinha, obtained B\u014dddhij\u00f1\u0101na. The fifth, which is called Tath\u0101gata Guhya, is not to be found in Nip\u0101l; the sixth, is the Sat Dharma Pundarik\u0101, which contains an account of the method of building a chaitya or Buddha-mandal, and the mode and fruits of worshipping it. (Chaitya * is the exclusive name of a temple dedicated to A'di-Buddha or to the Pancha Dhy\u0101ni Buddhas, and whatever temple is erected to S\u0101kya, or other M\u0101nushi Buddhas, is called vih\u0101r;)\u2020 the seventh, is the Lalita Vist\u0101ra, of 7,000 slocas, which contains the history of the several incarnations of S\u0101kya Sinha Bhagav\u0101n, and an account of his perfections in virtue and knowledge, with some notices of other Buddhas. The eighth, is the Suvarna Prabh\u0101, containing, in 1,500 slocas, an account of Saraswat\u012b, Lak\u1e63hm\u012b and Pr\u012bthv\u012b; how they lauded S\u0101kya Sinha Bhagav\u0101n; and how he, in return, gave each of them what she desired. The ninth, is the Das'a Bh\u016bmi\u015bvara, of 2,000 slocas, containing an account of the ten Bh\u016bvanas of\n\n---\n\n* See Plate V.\u2014N.B. Besides these chaityas and the Vih\u0101rs, the Nipalese have common temples, dedicated equally to the Dii minores and the Bauddhas, and to all the deities of the Saivas.\u2014See Plate VI.\n\n\u2020 See Plate VII.\nBuddha. All these Pur\u0101\u1e47as we received from S\u0101kya Sinha, and esteem them our primitive scriptures, because before the time of S\u0101kya our religion was not reduced to writing, but retained in memory; the disadvantages of which latter method being evident to S\u0101kya, he secured our institutes by writing them. Besides these Pur\u0101\u1e47as, we received Tantras and Dh\u0101ran\u012bs from S\u0101kya Sinha. Tantra is the name of those books in which Mantras and Yantras are written, explanatory of both of which we have very many works. Three of them are famous: first, M\u00e1y\u00e1 Jil, of 16,000 slocas; second, R\u00e1li Chakra, of 6,000; third, Sambhu Udaya, of 1,000. The Dh\u0101ran\u012bs were extracted from the Tantras, and are similar in nature to the G\u016bhya, or mysterious rites, of the Siva-M\u0101rgis. A Dh\u0101ran\u012b is never less than eight slocas, or more than five hundred; in the beginning and middle of which are written the \"Vija Mantra,\" and at the end, the \"Thul Stotra,\" or the Mah\u0101tmya, i.e. what desire may be accomplished or what business achieved by the perusal of that Dh\u0101ran\u012b; such, for example, as obtaining children\u2014advantage over an enemy\u2014rain\u2014or merely the approbation of Buddha. There are probably a thousand Dh\u0101ran\u012bs.\n\nQuestion XIV.\n\nWhat is the cause of good and evil?\n\nAnswer.\n\nWhen Padma-P\u0101ni, having become Tri-gun-Atmaka, that is, having assumed the form of Satya-gun, Raja-gun, and Tama-gun, created Brahm\u0101, Vishnu, and Mahes'a; then from Satyagun, arose spontaneously (Swabh\u0101vaka), punya or virtue, and from Tamagun, p\u00e1pa or evil, and from Raja-gun, the mean of the two, which is neither all good nor all evil: for these three gunas are of such a quality that good acts, mixed acts, and bad acts, necessarily flow from them. Each of these karmas or classes of actions is divided into ten species, so that p\u00e1pa is of ten kinds; first (see note 27) murder; second, robbery; third, adultery, which are called k\u0101yaka or bodily, i.e. derived from Kdy\u0101; fourth, lying; fifth, secret slander; sixth, reviling; seventh, reporting such words between two persons as excite them to quarrels, and these four p\u00e1pas are called V\u0101chaka, i.e. derived from speech; eighth, coveting another's goods; ninth, malice, and tenth, disbelief of the scriptures and immorality; and these three are called m\u0101nasi, i.e. derived from manas (the mind). The ten actions opposite\nto these are good actions: and the ten actions, composed, half and half, of these two sorts, are mixed actions.\n\n**Question XV.**\n\nWhat is the motive of your good acts\u2014the love of God\u2014the fear of God\u2014or the desire of prospering in the world?\n\n**Answer.**\n\nThe primary motive for doing well, and worshipping Buddha, according to the scriptures, is the hope of obtaining Mukti and Moksha, becoming Nirvana, and being freed from transmigrations: these exalted blessings cannot be had without the love of God; therefore they, who make themselves accepted by God, are the true saints, and are rarely found; and between them and Buddha there is no difference, because they will eventually become Buddhas, and will obtain Nirvana Pada, i.e. mukti (absorption), and their jyoti will be absorbed into the jyoti of Buddha; and to this degree Sakyas and the others of the \"Sapta-Buddhas\" (see note 28) have arrived, and we call them Buddhas, because, whoever has reached this state is, in our creed, a Buddha. Those persons who do good from the fear of hell, and avoid evil from the desire of prospering in the world, are likewise rarely found, and their degree is much above that of the class of sinners. Their sufferings in Naraka will be therefore lessened; but they will be constrained to suffer several transmigrations, and endure pain and pleasure in this world, till they obtain Mukti and Moksha.\n\n**Question XVI.**\n\nWill you answer, in the world to come, to A'di-Buddha for your acts in this world, or to whom will you answer? and what rewards for good, and pains for evil, will you reap in the next world?\n\n**Answer.**\n\nHow can the wicked arrive at Buddha? (see note 29.) Their wicked deeds will hurry them away to Naraka; and the good, will, by virtue of their good acts, be transported to the Bhuvanas of Buddha, and will not be there interrogated at all; and those who have sometimes done good and sometimes evil, are destined to a series of births and deaths on earth, and the account of their actions is kept by Yama Raja.\n\n**Question XVII.**\n\nDo you believe in the metempsychosis?\nAnswer.\n\nYes. For it is written in the J\u0101taka M\u0101la, and also in the Lalita Vist\u0101ra, that S\u0101kya, after having transmigrated through five hundred and one bodies, obtained Nirv\u0101na Pada or Mukti in the last body; but so long as we cannot acquire Mukti, so long we must pass through births and deaths on earth. Some acquire Moksha after the first birth, some after the seventy-seventh, and some after innumerable births. It is nowhere written that Moksha is to be obtained after a prescribed number of births; but every man must atone for the sins of each birth by a proportionate number of future births, and when the sins of the body are entirely purified and absolved, he will obtain absorption into A'di Buddha.\n\nQuestion XVIII.\n\nWhat and from whence are the N\u00e9wars, from Hindustan or Bhote? (see note 30), and what is the word N\u00e9war, the name of a country or a people?\n\nAnswer.\n\nThe natives of the valley of Nip\u00e1l are N\u00e9wars. In Sanscrit the country is called Naip\u00e1la, and the inhabitants Naip\u00e1li; and the words n\u00e9w\u00e1r and n\u00e9wdri are vulgarisms arising from the mutation of p to v, and l to r. Thus too the word Bandya, the name of the Buddhamarg\u00ed sect (because its followers make bandana, i.e. salutation and reverence to the proficients in Bodhijn\u00e1na), is metamorphosed by ignorance into B\u00e1nra, a word which has no meaning.\n\nQuestion XIX.\n\nDo the N\u00e9wars follow the doctrine of caste or not?\n\nAnswer.\n\nAs inhabitants of one country they are one\u2014but in regard to caste, they are diverse.\n\nQuestion XX.\n\nHow many castes are there amongst the B\u00e1nras?\n\nAnswer.\n\nB\u00e1nra, according to the true reading, is Bandya, as explained above. According to our Pur\u00e1nas, whoever has adopted the tenets of Buddha, and has cut off the lock from the crown of his head, of whatever tribe or nation he be, becomes thereby a Bandya (see note 31). The Bhotiyas, for example, are Bandyas because they follow the tenets of Buddha, and have\nno lock on their heads. The Bandyas are divided into two classes; those who follow the V\u00e1hya-charya, and those who adopt the Abhyantara-charya\u2014words equivalent to the Grihastha \u00e1sram and Vair\u00e1gi \u00e1sram of the Brahmanas. The first class is denominated Bhikshu; the second, Vajra A'ch\u00e1rya. The Bhikshu cannot marry; but the Vajra A'ch\u00e1rya is a family man. The latter is sometimes called, in the vernacular tongue of the N\u00e9wars, G\u00fabdal, which is not a Sanscrit word. Besides this distinction into monastic and secular orders, the Bandyas are again divided, according to the scriptures, into five classes: first, Arhan; second, Bhikshu; third, Sr\u00e1-waka; fourth, Chailaka; fifth, Vajra A'ch\u00e1rya. The Arhan is he who is perfect himself, and can give perfection to others; who eats what is offered to him, but never asks for any thing. The Bhikshu, is he who assumes a staff and beggar's dish (khikshari and pinda p\u00e1tra), sustains himself by alms, and devotes his attention solely to the contemplation (dhy\u00e1na) of A'di-Buddha, without ever intermeddling with worldly affairs. The Sr\u00e1waka is he who devotes himself to hearing the Buddha scriptures read or reading them to others; these are his sole occupations, and he is sustained by the small presents of his audiences. The Chailaka is he who contents himself with such a portion of clothes (chilaka) as barely suffices to cover his nakedness, rejecting every thing more as superfluous. The Bhikshu and the Chailaka very nearly resemble each other, and both (and the Arhan also) are bound to practice celibacy. The Vajra A'ch\u00e1rya is he who has a wife and children, and devotes himself to the active ministry of Buddhism. Such is the account of the five classes found in the scriptures; but there are no traces of them in N\u00edp\u00e1l. No one follows the rules of that class to which he nominally belongs. Among the Bhotiyas there are many Bhikshus, who never marry; and the Bhotiya Lamas are properly Arhans. But all the N\u00edpalese Buddh\u00e1m\u00e1rg\u00eds are married men, who pursue the business of the world, and seldom think of the injunctions of their religion. The Tantras and Dh\u00e1ran\u00eds, which ought to be read for their own salvation, they read only for the increase of their stipend and from a greedy desire of money. This division into five classes is according to the scriptures; but there is a popular division according to Vih\u00e1rs, and these Vih\u00e1rs being very numerous, the separate congregations of the Bandyas, have been thus greatly multiplied. In P\u00e1tan alone there are fifteen Vih\u00e1rs. A temple to A'di-Buddha, or to the five Dhy\u00e1ni-Buddhas, called a Chaitya, is utterly distinct from the Vih\u00e1r, and of the form of a sheaf of Dh\u00e1nya. But the temples of S\u00e1ky\u00e1 and\nthe other of the \"Sapta Buddha M\u00e1nushi,\" as well as those of other chief saints and leaders of Buddhism, are called Vih\u00e1rs. The names of the fifteen Vih\u00e1rs of P\u00e1tan are as follows: Tankal-Vih\u00e1r, T\u00fa-Vih\u00e1r, Hak-Vih\u00e1r, Bh\u00fa-Vih\u00e1r, Haran-Varna-Mah\u00e1-Vih\u00e1r, Rudra-Varna-Mah\u00e1-Vih\u00e1r, Bhikshu-Vih\u00e1r, S\u00e1kya-Vih\u00e1r, Guhya-Vih\u00e1r, Sh\u00ed-Vih\u00e1r, Dhom-Vih\u00e1r, Un-Vih\u00e1r, &c. (see note 32.) In short, if any Bandya die, and his son erect a temple in his name, such structure may be called such an one's (after his name) Vih\u00e1r. With this distinction, however, that a temple to an eminent saint is denominated Mah\u00e1-Vih\u00e1r\u2014one to an ordinary mortal, simply Vih\u00e1r.\n\nTo conclude: with respect to the notes\u2014that portion of this sketch, which is my own\u2014no one can be more sensible than I am that the first half contains a sad jumble of cloudy metaphysics. How far the sin of this indistinctness is mine, and how far that of my original authorities, I cannot pretend to decide; but am ready to take a large share of it to myself. In regard to this, the most speculative part of Buddhism, it is sufficient happiness for me to have discovered and placed within the reach of my countrymen the materials for more accurate investigation, by those who have leisure, patience, and a knowledge of languages for the undertaking; and who, with competent talents, will be kind enough to afford the world the benefit of so irksome an exercise of them.\n\nBut I trust that the latter half of the notes, which embraces topics more practical and more within the range of the favorite pursuits of my leisure, will not be found wanting in distinctness; and I can venture confidently to warrant the accuracy of the information contained in it.\n\nNOTES.\n\n(1) Here a sloca of the Sambhu Pur\u00e1na is quoted in the original paper; and it was my first intention to have repeated it on the margin of the translation; but, upon reflection, I believe it will be better to observe, that the Sambhu Pur\u00e1na is a work peculiar to Nip\u00e1l. Many other Buddha scriptures, however, which are not local, and are of high authority, symbolize the forming and changing powers of nature by the letters of the alphabet; and ascribe the pre-eminence among these letters to a, u, and m\u2014making the mystic syllable \u00f3m, which is not less reverenced by Bauddhas than by Br\u00e1hmanas. A, the Bauddhas say, is the Vija Mantra of the\nperson Buddha; U, the Vija Mantra of the person Dharma'; and M, that of the person Sanga\u2014and these three persons form the Buddhist Triad.*\n\nThe Baudh\u0101s, however, differ in their mode of classing the three persons. According to the Aishwarikas, the male, Buddha, the symbol of generative power, is the first member; the female, Dharma', the type of productive power, is the second; and Sanga, their son, is the third, and represents actual creative power, or an active creator and ruler, deriving his origin from the union of the essences of Buddha and Dharma'. Sanga, according to all the schools, though a member, is an inferior member of the triad.\n\n(2) Another sloca is here quoted; but it will not justify the language of the text, in which there is some confusion of the opposite doctrines of the Aishwarikas and Swabh\u0101vikas. In the triad of the latter, the female, Dharma' (also called Prajna'), the type of productive power, is the first member; Up\u0101ya, or Buddha, the symbol of generative power, the second; and Sanga the third;\u2020 their son as before, and the active author of creation, or rather the type of that spontaneous creation, which results necessarily from the union of the two principles of nature before-mentioned.\n\nBuddha and Prajna' united become Up\u0101ya Prajna'; or vice versa, according to the school, and never as in the text. (For some further remarks upon these chief objects of Baudh\u0101 worship, see Notes 12 and 29.)\n\nI take this early opportunity to remark that candid criticism will compare, and not contrast, the statements made in Notes 10, 12, 17, 20, and 29, especially with reference to the Swabh\u0101vika doctrine. (See Note 16.)\n\n(3) The deduction of the five Dhy\u0101ni Buddhas, and the five Dhy\u0101ni Bodhi Satwas, from A'di-Buddha, according to the Aishwarika Baudh\u0101s, will be stated farther on. It is a celestial or divine creation, and is here improperly mixed with the generative creations, theistic and atheistic, of various doctors.\n\n(4) See Note 23.\n\n(5) The sloca quoted is from the Puj\u0101 K\u0101nd, which is a mere manual of worship, of recent origin, and probably local to Nip\u0101l. It professes, however, to be a faithful compilation from the Guna-K\u0101randa Vy\u016bha, and K\u0101randa Vy\u016bha. The latter of these is a work of respectable authority, and contains the following partial justification of the language of the Puj\u0101 K\u0101nd. (Sa\u1e45kya, speaking to his disciple Sarva'ni Varana Vishkambhi, says) \"In the very distant times of Vipasya Buddha I was born as the son of Suganda Mukha, a merchant: in that birth I heard from Vipasya the following account of the qualities of A'rya'valokiteshwari (Padma Pa'ni). The sun proceeded from one of his eyes: and from the other, the moon; from his forehead Mah\u0101deva; from between his shoulders, Brahma'; from his chest, Vishnu; from his teeth, Sarasvat\u012b; from his mouth, Va'yu; from his feet, Prithivi; from his navel, Varuna.\" So many deities issued from A'rya'valokiteshwara's body. This passage is expanded in the Guna-Karand Vy\u016bha, wherein it is added, that when A'rya'valokiteshwara had created Brahma', Vishnu, and\n\n* See Plate II, fig. a, b, c. \u2020 See Plate II, d, e, f.\nMahesa, they stood before him, and he said to the first, \"be thou the lord of Satyaguna and create;\" and to the second, \"be thou the lord of Rajaguna and preserve;\" and to the third, \"be thou the lord of Tamaguna and destroy.\" The Guna-Karanda Vy\u016bha is however a mere amplification of the Karanda Vy\u016bha, and of much less authority. In a passage of the Saraha Dh\u0101ra\u2014which is not one of the sacred writings of Nipal, but a work of high authority, written by Sarvajna Mitrapada, a Buddha ascetic of Cashmeer\u2014the Hindu deities are made to issue from the body of the supreme Prajna just as, according to the Karanda Vy\u016bha, they proceed from that of Padma Pani.\n\n(6) The authority for these ten mansions is the Dasu Bh\u016bm\u0113shwuru, one of the nine great works spoken of in the answer to the thirteenth question; and which treats professedly of the subject. The thirteen mansions are, however, mentioned in sundry works of high authority; and the thirteen grades of the superior part of the Chaitya (or proper Buddha temple) are typical of the thirteen celestial mansions alluded to in the text. The most essential part of the Chaitya is the solid hemisphere; but the vast majority of Chaityas in Nipal have the hemisphere surmounted by a pyramid or cone, called Ch\u016br\u0101 Moni, and invariably divided into thirteen grades.*\n\n(7) All this, as well as what follows, is a mere transcript from the Brahmanical writings. There is, nevertheless, authority for it in the Buddha scriptures. The Buddhas seem to have adopted without hesitation the cosmography and chronology of the Brahmans, and also a large part of their pantheon. They freely confess to have done so at this day. The favourite Brahmanical deities accepted by the Buddhists are, of males: Mah\u0101 K\u0101la, Indra, Ganesa, Hanum\u0101n, and the triad. Of females: Lak\u1e63mi and Sarasvat\u012b. The Hindu triad are considered by the Buddhists as the mere servants of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, and only entitled to such reverence as may seem fit to be paid to faithful servants of so high masters. Of the origin of these deities, according to the Buddha books, I have already given one account, and referred to another. The notions of the three gunas and of the creation, &c. by the Brahmanic triad as the delegates of the Bodhisattvas, I look upon to be modern inventions. According to genuine Buddhism, the Bodhisattvas are, each in his turn, the active agents of the creation and government of the world.\n\n(8) An important historical person, and the apparent introducer of Buddhism into Nipal. (See note 30.)\n\n(9) This is a most curious legend. I have not yet seen the Tantra whence it professes to be extracted, and suspect that the legend was stolen from our Bible, by some inhabitant of Nipal, who had gathered a confused idea of the Mosaic history of the origin and fall of mankind from the Jesuit missionaries, formerly resident in this valley; or perhaps the legend in question was derived from some of those various corrupt versions of the biblical story which have been current among the Jews and Moslems of Asia for many centuries.\n\n(10) This limited reply is the fault of my friend and not of his books. Matter is called Prakriti by the Buddhists, as well as by the Brahmans. The Swabh\u0101vika school\n\n* See Plate III.\nof *Bauddha* philosophy (apparently the oldest school) seems to have considered matter as the sole entity, to have ascribed to it all the attributes of deity, and to have assigned to it two modalities; one termed *nirvritti*, and the other *pravritti* (See Note 12.) To speak more precisely, the above is rather the doctrine of the *Pr\u00e1j\u00f1ika Swabh\u00e1vikas* than of the simple *Swabh\u00e1vikas*: for the former unitize the active and intelligent powers of nature, the latter do not unitize them; and prefer to all other symbols of those dispersed powers of nature the letters of the alphabet generally, and without much regard to the pre-eminence of a, u, and m. Indeed, it is probable that the mystic syllable Aum is altogether a comparatively recent importation into Buddhism. The Lotos is a very favourite type of creative power with all the *Bauddhas*; and accordingly representations of it occur in a thousand places, and in as many forms in the *Bauddha* sculptures and architecture; for which, see the drawings which accompany this sketch, *passim*.\n\n(11) The sloca quoted is from a modern little manual of *P\u00e1j\u00e1*. I have not seen any adequate original authority; but the *Aishwarika* Buddhists, who maintained an eternal, infinite, intellectual *A'di-Buddha*, in all probability made the human soul an emanation from him; and considered *M\u00f3ksha* a remanation to him.\n\n(12) The *Swabh\u00e1vikas*, the name assumed by one of the four schools of *Bauddha* philosophy, and apparently the oldest, are divided into two sects; one called *Swabh\u00e1vikas* simply, the other *Pr\u00e1j\u00f1ika Swabh\u00e1vikas*. The former maintain that an eternal revolution of entity and non-entity is the system of nature, or of matter, which alone exists. The *Pr\u00e1j\u00f1ikas* deify matter as the sole substance, and give it two modes, the abstract and the concrete: in the former, they unitize the active and intelligent powers held to be inherent in matter, and make this unit deity. Such is the abstract or proper mode, which is unity, immutability, rest, bliss. The second is the contingent or concrete mode, or that of actual, visible, nature. To this mode belong action, multiplicity, change, pain. It begins by the energies of matter passing from their proper and eternal state of rest into their contingent and transitory state of action; and ends when those energies resume their proper modality. The proper mode is called *nirvritti*; the contingent mode *pravritti*. The powers of matter cannot be described in their proper state of abstraction and unity. In the latter state, all the order and beauty of nature are images of their quality: they are also symbolized by the *Y\u00f3ni*, and personified as a female divinity called *A'di Praj\u00f1a' and *A'di Dh\u00e1rma'. Man's *summum bonum* is to pass from the transmigrations incident to the state of *pravritti* into the eternal rest or bliss of *nirvritti*. The Triadic doctrine of all the schools is referable solely to *pravritti*. In the state of *nirvritti*, with some of the *Aishwarikas*, *Buddha* represents intellectual essence and the then sole entity; with others of the *Aishwarikas Dh\u00e1rma', or material essence exists biunely with *Buddha* in *nirvritti*, the two being in that state one. With the *Praj\u00f1ikas Praj\u00f1a'; in the state of *nirvritti*, is the *summum et solum numen*, *Diva Natura*\u2014the sum of all the intellectual and physical forces of matter, considered as the sole entity, and held to exist in the state of *nirvritti* abstracted from palpable material *substance*, eternally, unchangeably, and essentially one. When this essential principle of matter passes into the state\nof pravritti, Buddha, the type of active power, first proceeds from it and then associates with it, and from that association results the actual visible world. The principle is feigned to be a female, first the mother, and then the wife, of the male Buddha. (For a glimpse at the esoteric sense of these enigmas, see note 29.)\n\n(13) The work cited is of secondary authority; but the mode of reasoning exhibited in the text is to be found in all Buddha works which treat of the Svacch\u0101vika doctrine.\n\n(14) This is the name of the Theistic school of the Buddha philosophers. The Sambh\u016b Pur\u0101\u1e47a and Guna K\u012branda Vidy\u0101 contain the least obscure enunciation of Theism\u2014and these books belong to Nip\u0101l. Other Buddha scriptures, however, which are not local, contain abundant expressions capable of a Theistic interpretation. Even those Buddha philosophers who have insisted that matter is the sole entity, have ever magnified the wisdom and power of nature: and doing so, they have reduced the difference of theism and atheism almost to a nominal one: so, at least, they frequently affirm.\n\nThe great defect of all the schools is the want of Providence and of dominion in their causa causarum, though the comparatively recent K\u0101rmikas and Y\u0101tnikas appear to have attempted to remedy this defect. (See the following note.)\n\n(15) Of two of the four schools of Buddha philosophy, namely, the Svacch\u0101vika and Aishvarika, I have already said a few words; the two remaining schools are denominated the K\u0101rmika and Y\u0101tnika\u2014from the words Karma, meaning moral action; and Yatna, signifying intellectual force, skilful effort. The proper topics of these two schools seem to me to be confined to the phenomena of human nature\u2014its free-will, its sense of right and wrong, and its mental power. To the wisdom of Swabh\u0101va, or Praj\u00f1\u0101', or \u0100di-Buddha, the Buddhas, both Svacch\u0101vikas and Aishvarikas, had assigned that eternal necessary connexion of virtue and felicity in which they alike believed. It remained for the K\u0101rmikas and Y\u0101tnikas to discuss how each individual free-willed man might most surely hope to realize that connexion in regard to himself; whether by the just conduct of his understanding, or by the proper cultivation of his moral sense? And the Y\u0101tnikas seem to have decided in favour of the former mode; the K\u0101rmikas, in favour of the latter. Having settled these points, it was easy for the Y\u0101tnikas and K\u0101rmikas to exalt their systems by linking them to the throne of the causa causarum\u2014to which they would be the more readily impelled, in order to remove from their faith the obloquy so justly attaching to the ancient Praj\u00f1\u0101ka, and even to the Aishvarika school, because of the want of Providence and of Dominion in their first cause. That the K\u0101rmikas and Y\u0101tnikas originally limited themselves to the phenomena of human nature, I think probable, from the circumstances that, out of some forty slokas which I have had collected to illustrate the doctrines of these schools, scarcely one goes beyond the point of whether man's felicity is secured by virtue or by intellect? And that, when these schools go further (as I have the evidence of two quotations from their books that they sometimes do), the trespassing on ground foreign to their systems seems obvious; thus in the Divya Avad\u0101n, Sa'kya says, \"from the union of Up\u0101ya and Praj\u00f1\u0101' arose man\u2014the lord of the senses; and from man\nproceeded good and evil;\" and this union of Upa'ya and Prajna' is then declared to be a Karma. And in the same work, in regard to the Y\u0101tnika doctrine, it is said, \"Ishwara (i.e. A'di-Buddha) produced Yatna from Prajna', and the cause of pravritti and nirvritti is Yatna; and all the difficulties that occur in the affairs of this world or of the next are rendered easy by Yatna.\" Impersonality and quiescence were the objections probably made to the first cause of the Pr\u0101jnikas and Aishwarikas; and it was to remove these objections that the more recent K\u0101rmikas and Y\u0101tnikas feigned conscious moral agency (Karma), and conscious intellectual agency (Yatna) to have been with the causa causarum (whether material or immaterial) from the beginning.\n\nOf all the schools, the K\u0101rmikas and Y\u0101tnikas alone seem to have been duly sensible of man's free-will, and God's moral attributes. The K\u0101rmika confession of faith is, \"Purva janma Kritang Karma tad Daivyam iti Kathyat\u00e9,\" which may be very well translated by our noble adage, \"conduct is fate.\" Such sentiments of human nature naturally inclined them to the belief of immaterial existences, and accordingly they will be found to attach themselves in theology chiefly to the Aishwarika school.\n\n(16) This is the divine creation alluded to in the third note. The eternal infinite and intellectual A'di-Buddha possesses, as proper to his own essence, five sorts of wisdom. From these he, by five separate acts of Dhy\u0101n, created the five Dhy\u0101ni Buddhas, to whom he gave the virtue of that j\u00f1\u0101n whence each derived his origin. These five Dhy\u0101ni Buddhas again created, each of them, a Dhy\u0101ni Bodhisatwa by the joint efficacy of the j\u00f1\u0101n received from A'di-Buddha, and of an act of his own Dhy\u0101n.\n\nThe five Dhy\u0101ni Buddhas are, like A'di-Buddha, quiescent\u2014and the active work of creation and rule is devolved on the Bodhisatwas. This creation by Dhy\u0101n is eminently characteristic of Buddhism\u2014but whose Dhy\u0101n possesses creative power? that of an eternal A'di-Buddha, say the Aishwarikas of the \u015a\u0101mbh\u016b P\u016brana\u2014that of any Buddha, even a M\u0101nushi or mortal Buddha, say the Swabh\u0101vikas. The Buddhas have no other notion of creation (than that by Dhy\u0101n), which is not generative.\n\n(17) These terms are common to all the schools of Baudh\u0101 philosophy; with the Aishwarikas, nirvritti is the state in which mind exists independent of matter; pravritti, the state in which it exists while mixed with matter. With the simple Swabh\u0101vikas the former term seems to import non-entity; the latter, entity. With the Pr\u0101jnika Swabh\u0101vikas, the former term signifies the state in which the active and intellectual power of matter exists abstractedly from visible nature; the latter, imports the manner or state in which the same power exists in connexion with visible nature. The Moksha of the first is absorption into A'di-Buddha; of the second, absorption into Shu'nya; of the third, identification with Prajna. In a word, nirvritti means abstraction, and pravritti, concretion\u2014from nirvritti is formed nirvritti, but pravritti has no prav\u0101n.\n\n(18) If so, I am afraid few Baudh\u0101s can be called wise. The doctrine of the text in this place is that of the Aishwarikas, set off to the best advantage: the doctrine incidentally objected is to that of the Swabh\u0101vikas and Pr\u0101jnikas. Sir W. Jones assures us that the Hindus \"consider creation (I should here prefer the word change) rather as an energy than as a work.\" This remark is yet more true in regard to the old\nBuddha philosophers: and the mooted point with them is, what energy creates? an energy intrinsic in some archetypal state of matter, or extrinsic? The old Buddha philosophers seem to have insisted that there is no sufficient evidence of immaterial entity. But, what is truly remarkable, some of them, at least, have united with that dogma a belief in moral and intellectual operations; nor is there one tenet so diagnostic of Buddhism as that which insists that man is capable of extending his moral and intellectual faculties to infinity. True it is, as Mr. Colebrooke has remarked, that the Hindu philosophy recognizes this dogma\u2014coldly recognizes it, and that is all: whereas, the Buddhas have pursued it into its most extravagant consequences, and made it the corner-stone of their faith and practice. (See note 29.)\n\n(19) I have not yet found that these Dhy\u0101ni Buddhas of the Theistic school do anything. They seem to be mere personifications, according to a Theistic theory, of the active and intellectual powers of nature\u2014and hence are called Panch Bh\u016bta, Panch Indriya, and Panch \u0100yatan \u0100k\u0101r.\n\nIt may seem contrary to this notion of the quiescence of the five Dhy\u0101ni Buddhas, that, according at least to some Nip\u0101l works, each of them has a Sakti. Vairochana's is Vajra-Dhateshwari; Akshobhya's, L\u014dchan\u0101; Ratna Sambhava's, M\u0101mukhi; Amitabha's, P\u0101ndar\u0101; Amogha Siddha's, T\u016br\u0101.* But I apprehend that these Buddha-sakties are peculiar to Nip\u0101l; and though I have found their names, I have not found that they do anything.\n\nThere is indeed a secret and filthy system of Buddhas and Buddha-Sakties, in which the ladies act a conspicuous part; and according to which, \u0100di-Buddha is styled Y\u014dgambara; and \u0100di-Dharm\u0101, Jn\u0101n-Eshwari. But this system has only been recently revealed to me, and I cannot say more of it at present.\n\n(20) According to the Aishwarikas; the Swabh\u0101vikas say, into Ak\u0101\u015b and Sh\u016bnyat\u0101; the Pr\u0101j\u00f1ikas, into \u0100di Praj\u00f1a. The Swabh\u0101vika doctrine of Sh\u016bnyat\u0101 is the darkest corner of their metaphysical labyrinth. It cannot mean strictly nothingness, since there are seven degrees of Sh\u016bnyat\u0101, whereof the first is Ak\u0101\u015b: and Ak\u0101\u015b is so far from being deemed nothingness that it is again and again said to be the only real substance. Language sinks under the expression of the Buddha abstractions; and by their Sh\u016bnyat\u0101 I understand sometimes the place, and sometimes the form, in which the infinitely attenuated elements of all things exist in their state of separation from the palpable system of nature.\n\nN.B. The images of all the seven great M\u0101nushi Buddhas, referred to in the answer to the 7th question, are exactly similar to that of Sa'kya Sinha,\u2020 the seventh of them. This image very nearly resembles that of Akshobhya, the second Dhy\u0101ni Buddha. The differences are found only in the supporters, and in the cognizances (chin\u0101s.) When coloured there is a more remarkable diagnosis, Ak\u1e63u\u1e0dbhya being blue, and Sa'kya and the other six M\u0101nushis yellow.\n\n(21) The Sambh\u016b Pur\u0101\u1e47a says, manifested in Nip\u0101l in the form of flame (Jyoti r\u016bpa).\n\n* See Plate IV, fig. a, b, c, d, e.\n\u2020 See Plate IV, fig. f.\nAccording to the same work, A'di Dharma's (or Prajna's) manifestation in Nip\u00e1l is in the form of water (jal sur\u00e1pa.)\n\n(22) This is the true solution of a circumstance which has caused much idle speculation: though the notion is, no doubt, an odd one for a sect which insists on tonsure!\n\n(23) These are Padma Pa'ni's names in his character of active creator and governor of the present world. Three Dhy\u00e1ni B\u00f3dhisatwas preceded him in that character, and one (the fifth) remains to follow him.*\n\n(24) I have already stated that these deities, conformably with the quiescent genius of Buddhism, do nothing; they are merely the medium through which creative power is communicated to the B\u00f3dhisatwas from Adi-Buddha. It is the B\u00f3dhisatwas alone who exercise that power, one at a time, and each in his turn. It is a ludicrous instance of Buddha contempt for action, that some recent writers have made a fourth delegation of active power to the three gods of the Hindu Triad.\n\n(25) Until he attained b\u00f3dhi jn\u00e1na; and even then, while yet lingering in the flesh, he got the name of Sa'kya Sinha. This name has caused some speculation, on the asserted ground of its not being Indian. The Buddha scriptures differ as to the city in which Sa'kya was born; but all the places named are Indian. They also say that the Shakvansa was an Indian race or family; as was the G\u00f3tamavansa, in which also Sa'kya was once born.\n\n(25 bis) This must be received with some allowance. The Lalita Vist\u00e1ra gives ample details of Sa'kya's numberless births and acts, but is nearly silent as to the origin or actions of his six great predecessors: and the like is true of many other Buddha scriptures.\n\n(26) These works are regularly worshipped in Nip\u00e1l as the \"Nava Dharma.\" They are chiefly of a narrative kind. The most important work of the speculative kind now extant in, Nip\u00e1l is the Raksha Bhagavati, consisting of no less than 125,000 slocas. This is a work of philosophy rather than of religion, and its spirit is sceptical to the very verge of pyrrhonism. The Buddhas of Nip\u00e1l hold it in the highest esteem, and I have sent three copies of it to Calcutta. Its arrangement, at least, and reduction to writing, are attributed (as are those of all the other Buddha scriptures) to Sa'kya Sinha. Whatever the Buddhas have said (sugutai desita) is an object of worship with the Buddhas. Sa'kya having collected these words of the Buddhas, and secured them in a written form, they are now worshipped under the names S\u00fatra and Dharma. The aggregation of nine Dharmas is for ritual purposes; but why the nine specified works have been selected to be thus peculiarly honoured I cannot say. They are probably the oldest and most authentic scriptures existing in Nip\u00e1l, though this conjecture is certainly opposed to the reverence expressed for the Raksha Bhagavati, by the Buddhists. That work (as already stated) is of vast extent, containing no less than 125,000 slocas, divided into five equal parts or khande, which are known by the names of the five P\u00e1rmitas and the five Rakshas.\n\n* For a representation of Padma Pa'ni, as Lo'ka Na'tha, see Plate IV. fig. 5.\n(27) The three first sins should be rendered, all destruction of life, all taking without right, and all sexual commerce whatever. The ten are the cardinal sins of Buddhism, and will bear a very favourable comparison with the five cardinal sins of Brahmanism.\n\n(28) The Buddhas mentioned in the Baudh\u0101na scriptures are innumerable. Many of them, however, are evident non-entities in regard to history. Even the Buddhas of mortal mould are vastly numerous, and of various degrees of power and rank. These degrees are three, entitled, Pratyek\u0101, Sravaka, and Mah\u0101 Y\u0101nika. Sa\u1e45kya \u015a\u0101nta is often said to be the seventh and last M\u0101nushi Buddha who has yet reached the supreme grade of the Mah\u0101 Y\u0101nika. In the Lalita Vistara, there is a formal enumeration of the perfections in knowledge and virtue requisite for attaining to each of these three grades\u2014a monstrously impracticable and impious array of human perfectibility! The three grades are known by the collective name of \"Tri J\u0101na,\" or \"Tri Y\u0101na.\"\n\n(29) Genuine Buddhism never seems to contemplate any measures of acceptance with the deity; but, overleaping the barrier between finite and infinite mind, urges its followers to aspire by their own efforts to that divine perfectibility of which it teaches that man is capable, and by attaining which man becomes God\u2014and thus is explained both the quiescence of the imaginary celestial, and the plenary omnipotence of the real M\u0101nushi Buddhas\u2014thus too we must account for the fact, that genuine Buddhism has no priesthood: the saint despises the priest; the saint scorns the aid of mediators, whether on earth or in heaven: \"conquer (exclaims the adept or Buddha to the novice or Bodhi-Satwa)\u2014conquer the importunities of the body, urge your mind to the meditation of abstraction, and you shall, in time, discover the great secret (Prajna) of nature; know this, and you become, on the instant, whatever priests have feigned of Godhead\u2014you become identified with Prajna', the sum of all the power and all the wisdom which sustain and govern the world, and which, as they are manifested out of matter, must belong solely to matter; not indeed in the gross and palpable state of pravritti, but in the archetypal and pure state of nirvritti. Put off therefore the vile, pravrittika necessities of the body, and the no less vile affections of the mind; urge your thoughts into pure abstraction (Dhy\u0101na), and then, as assuredly you can, so assuredly you shall, attain to the wisdom of a Buddha (Bodhiyana), and become associated with the eternal unity and rest of nirvritti.\" Such, I believe, is the esoteric doctrine of the Pr\u0101j\u00f1ikas\u2014that of the Svabh\u0101vikas is nearly allied to it, but more timid and sceptical; they too magnify the wisdom and power of nature so abundantly diffused throughout pravritti, but they seem not to unitize that wisdom and power in the state of nirvritti, and incline to conceive of nirvritti as of a state of things concerning which nothing can be predicated; but which, even though it be nothingness (Shunyat\u0101), is at least a blissful rest to man, otherwise doomed to an eternity of transmigrations through all forms of visible nature: and while the Svabh\u0101vikas thus underrated the nirvritti of the Pr\u0101j\u00f1ikas, it is probable that they compensated themselves by magnifying, more than the Pr\u0101j\u00f1ikas did, that pravrittika omnipotence of which the wise man (Buddha) is capable, even upon earth. It has been already stated that the second\nperson of the Pr\u00e1j\u00f1ika Triad is denominated Buddha and Up\u00e1ya; of which terms the esoteric sense is this: Every man possesses in his understanding, when properly cultivated according to the rules of Buddhism, the means or expedient (Up\u00e1ya) of discovering the supreme wisdom of nature (Praj\u00f1a), and of realizing, by this discovery in his own person, a plenary omnipotence or divinity! which begins even while he yet lingers in the flesh (in pravritti); but which is not fully accomplished till he passes, by the body's decay, into the eternal state of nirvitti.\n\nAnd as the wisdom of man is, in its origin, but an effluence of the Supreme wisdom (Praj\u00f1a) of nature, so is it perfected by a refluxion to its source, but without loss of individuality: whence Praj\u00f1a is feigned in the exoteric system to be both the mother and the wife of all the Buddhas, \"janani sarva Buddha,\" and \"Jin-s\u00e1ndari;\" for the efflux is typified by a birth, and the reflux by a marriage.\n\nThe Buddha is the adept in the wisdom of Buddhism (b\u00f3dhijn\u00e1n) whose first duty, so long as he remains on earth, is to communicate his wisdom to those who are willing to receive it. These willing learners are the \"B\u00f3dhisatwas,\" so called from their hearts being inclined to the wisdom of Buddhism, and \"Sangas,\" from their companionship with one-another, and with their Buddha or teacher, in the Vih\u00e1rs or coenobitical establishments.\n\nAnd such is the esoteric interpretation of the third (and inferior) member of the Pr\u00e1j\u00f1ika Triad. The B\u00f3dhisatwa or Sanga continues to be such until he has surmounted the very last grade of that vast and laborious ascent by which he is instructed that he can \"scale the heavens,\" and pluck immortal wisdom from its resplendent source: which achievement performed, he becomes a Buddha, that is, an Omniscient Being, and a Tath\u00e1guta\u2014a title implying the accomplishment of that gradual increase in wisdom by which man becomes a Buddha. These doctrines are very obscurely indicated in the Bauddha scriptures, whose words have another more obvious and very different sense; nor, but for the ambition of the commentators to exhibit their learning, would it be easy to gather the esoteric sense of the words of most of the original scriptures. I never was more surprised than when my old friend recently (after a six years' acquaintance) brought to me, and explained, a valuable comment upon a passage in the Praj\u00f1a P\u00e1rmita. Let me add in this place, that I desire all searchers after the doctrine of B\u00f3dhijn\u00e1n to look into the Bauddha scriptures, and judge for themselves; and to remember, meanwhile, that I am not a Sanscrit scholar, and am indebted for all I have gathered from the books of the Buddhists to the mediation of my old Baudda friend, and of my Pundit.\n\n(30) Their physiognomy, their language, their architecture, civil and religious, their notions in regard to women, and several less important traits in their manners and customs, seem to decide that the origin of the greater part of the N\u00e9wars must be assigned to the north: and in the Sambh\u00fa Pur\u00e1na, a Bauddha teacher named Manj-Gh\u00f3k, and Manj Natii and Manju\u015bri, is stated to have led a colony into N\u00edp\u00e1l from China; to have cleared N\u00edp\u00e1l of the waters which then covered it; to have made the country habitable; to have built a temple to Jyoti-r\u00fa'p-A'di-Buddha; and established\nDharma'kar (whom he brought with him) as first Raja of Nip\u00e1l. But I nevertheless suppose (upon the authority of tradition) that Nip\u00e1l received some colonists from India; and that some of the earliest propagators of Buddhism in Nip\u00e1l came to the valley direct from India. Be that as it may, the Indian origin of Nipalese Buddhism (whether it reached the valley direct, or via Bhote or China) seems to be unquestionable from the fact that all the great Sangata scriptures of Nip\u00e1l are written in the Sanscrit language. From the gradual decay of literature and of a knowledge of Sanscrit among the N\u00e9wars has resulted the practice, now very common, of translating ritual works into the vernacular tongue; and also the usage of adding to the original Sanscrit of such works comments in the vulgar language. The great scriptures however have never been subjected to the former process; seldom to the latter; for owing to Sanscrit having always been considered by the Buddhists of Nip\u00e1l the language of literature, they have neglected to cultivate their vernacular tongue; nor does there exist to this day a dictionary or grammar of the N\u00e9wari language.\n\n(31) Of course therefore the Baudhas of Nip\u00e1l have not properly any diversity of caste; that is, any indelible distinction of ranks derived from birth, and necessarily carried to the grave. Genuine Buddhism proclaims the equality of all followers of Buddha\u2014seems to deny to them the privilege of pursuing worldly avocations, and abhors the distinction of clergy and laity. All proper Baudhas are Bandyas; and all Bandyas are equal as brethren in the faith. They are properly all ascetics\u2014some solitary, mostly coenobitical. Their convents are called Vih\u00e1rs. The rule of these Vih\u00e1rs is a rule of freedom; and the door of every Vih\u00e1r is always open, both to the entrance of new comers, and to the departure of such of their old inmates as are tired of their vows. Each Vih\u00e1r has a titular superior, whose authority over his brethren depends only on their voluntary deference to his superior learning or piety. Women are held equally worthy of admission with men, and each sex has its Vih\u00e1rs.\n\nThe old Baudha scriptures enumerate four sorts of Bandyas, named Arhan, Bhikshu, Sr\u00e1vaka and Chailaka, who are correctly described in the text; and from that description it will be seen that there is no essential distinction between them, the Arhan being only segregated from the rest by his superior proficiency in Bodhiy\u00e1n. Of these the proper institutes of Buddhism, there remains hardly a trace in Nip\u00e1l. The very names of the Arhan and Chailaka have passed away\u2014the names, and the names only, of the other two exist; and out of the gradual, and now total, disuse of monastic institutes, an exclusive minister of the altar, denominated Vajra Ach\u00e1rya, has derived his name, office, and existence in Nip\u00e1l, not only without sanction from the Baudha scriptures, but in direct opposition to their spirit and tendency. Nip\u00e1l is still covered with Vih\u00e1rs; but these ample and comfortable abodes have long resounded with the hum of industry and the pleasant voices of women and children. The superior ministry of religion is now solely in the hands of the Bandyas, entitled, Vajra-Ach\u00e1rya in Sanscrit; G\u00fabh\u00fal in Newari: the inferior ministry, such Bhikshus as still follow religion as a lucrative and learned profession, are competent to discharge. And these professions of the Vajra Ach\u00e1rya, and of the Bhikshu, have become by usage hereditary, as have all other\nA KOSHTHAKAR or COMPOSITE CHAITTA.\n\nCopied from the Original on Mount Sambh\u00fb, by a Nepalese Artist.\n\nN.B. The lower part of this Structure is a Square and hollow within.\navocations and pursuits, whether civil or religious, in Nip\u00e1l. And as in the modern corrupt Buddhism of Nip\u00e1l there are exclusive ministers of religion or priests, so are there many Baudhas who retain the lock on the crown of the head, and are not Bandyas. These improper Baudhas are called Ud\u00e1s: they never dwell in the Vih\u00e1rs, look up to the Bandyas with a reverential respect derived from the misapplication of certain ancient tenets, and follow those trades and avocations which are comparatively disreputable (among which is foreign commerce); while the Bandyas, who have abandoned the profession of religion, practise those crafts which are most esteemed. Agriculture is equally open to both; but is, in fact, chiefly followed by the Ud\u00e1s, who have thus become, in course of time, more numerous than the Bandyas, notwithstanding the early abandonment by the Bandyas of those ascetical practices which their faith enjoins, the resort of the greater part of them to the active business of the world, and their usurpation of all the liberal, and three-fourths of the mechanical arts of their country; for the Bandyas have the exclusive inheritance of thirty-six professions and trades; the Ud\u00e1s, that of seven trades only. The Vajra Ach\u00e1rya and Bhikshu are the religious guides and priests of both Bandyas and Ud\u00e1s. All Bandyas, whatever be the profession or trade they hereditarily exercise, are still equal; they intermarry, and communicate in all the social offices of life\u2014and the like is true of all Ud\u00e1s\u2014but between the one class and the other, growing superstition has erected an insuperable barrier. To the above remarks it may be well to add, that Buddhists, of some one or other of the above denominations, comprise the vast majority of the New\u00e1r race, and that the majority are Saivas; but in a sense peculiar to themselves, and with which my subject does not entitle me here to meddle.\n\n(33) The names are almost all barbarous; that is, not derived from Sanscrit, but from Newari. I have not thought it worth while to enumerate any more of these examples. The Vih\u00e1r is built round a large quadrangle, or open square, two stories high; the architecture is Chinese. Chaitya properly means a temple of Buddha, and Vih\u00e1r an abode of caenobitical followers of Buddha. In the open square in the midst of every Vih\u00e1r, is placed a Chaitya\u2014but those words always bear the senses here attached to them; and Vih\u00e1r can never be construed temple\u2014it is a convent, or monastery, or religious house, but never templum Dei vel Buddh\u00e6. At the base of the hemisphere of every Nip\u00e1l Chaitya are placed the images of the Dhya'ni Buddhas. The Chaitya has often been blended with sundry structures, more or less appropriate to Buddhism. See Plates III. and VII.\nXIV. An Account of the Sculptures and Inscriptions at Mah\u00e1malaipur; illustrated by Plates. By Benjamin Guy Babington, M.B., F.R.S., Sec.R.A.S.\n\nRead July 12, 1828.\n\nThe remains of ancient sculpture, called by Europeans the Seven Pagodas, on the Coromandel Coast, thirty-five miles south of Madras, have long attracted the attention of those who feel an interest in Hindu Archaeology; and, so long ago as the year 1788, formed the subject of a paper in the first volume of the Asiatic Researches. The author, Mr. William Chambers, wrote from memory, after an interval of twelve years from the period at which he had visited the scene which he described. His account, unaccompanied as it was by drawings or fac similes of the inscriptions, could therefore scarcely be expected to be sufficiently minute to answer any further purpose than that avowed by himself, of exciting public attention, and \"giving rise to more accurate observations, and more complete discoveries on the same subject.\" In the fifth volume of the Asiatic Researches, published in 1798, there is a more descriptive account of these temples and excavations, written by Mr. Goldingham, a gentleman of well-known talent, on whose observations, as they were recorded on the spot, we may with confidence rely. Mrs. Graham is indeed a later writer on the subject: but her remarks are desultory, and her information imperfect, as might be expected from the opportunities presenting themselves to a casual and hasty visitor. In Bishop Heber's narrative three pages are devoted to a notice of Maha-Bali-poor. (Pages 216-218, vol. iii.) But the author merely follows the legends of the place, and evidently aims at nothing more than a record in his journal of his impressions on a cursory visit. The testimony, however, which this lamented prelate bears to the degree of skill displayed in these sculptures must, from his acknowledged taste, be looked upon as peculiarly valuable; and it is gratifying to one who has taken much interest in them to find, that he\nconsidered \"some of the porticoes, temples and bas-reliefs as very beautifully executed,\" and pronounced \"the general merit of the work as superior to that of Elephanta.\"\n\nWith these notices already before the public, it would be superfluous to occupy the attention of the Society with another detailed description of these monuments, and I shall therefore content myself with a reference to Mr. Goldingham's paper, as far as may be necessary to accomplish the objects which I have at present in view. These are, first, to convey a just notion of the merits of the principal sculptures, by means of drawings made on the spot by Mr. Andrew Hudleston and myself, several years since; and, secondly, to throw some light upon the inscriptions found among these temples.\n\nTo the legendary accounts of the Brahmans at Mah\u00e1malaipur, which are given at such length by Mr. Chambers and Mrs. Graham, I attach little value, because I find that they have not even preserved the memory of the language and character of the inscriptions which here abound; and because this place, in being accounted the work of the five sons of P\u00e1ndu, only shares a tradition common to all the antiquities of unexplained origin in the south of India. So far from believing in the tales of these Brahmans, who are obviously interested in connecting wonderful stories with the remains which they gain a livelihood by shewing to strangers, I even doubt whether Mah\u00e1malaipur was ever, as asserted by them, the site of a great city, now partly covered by the sea; and still more, whether the gilded summit of one of the five pagodas, said to be so covered, was visible two generations ago. Several circumstances lead me to be sceptical on these points: first, the absence of all remains of buildings,* walls, mounds of rubbish, or broken pottery, such as I have invariably found surrounding the site of other ancient cities; secondly, the fruitless attempts made by the late Mr. Ellis and Col. Mackenzie to ascertain the existence of sunken buildings by careful soundings made off the shore; thirdly, the silence of tradition on other parts of the Coromandel coast regarding so vast an encroachment of the sea, and consequent loss of land, as must necessarily have taken place to effect the submersion of lofty pagodas still remaining erect, and that too since the formation of the present system of Hindu mythology, to which the existing sculptures obviously relate; fourthly, the\n\n* The small ruined brick edifice on the top of the rock can hardly be considered an exception.\ncircumstance that the authenticity of the legend must mainly depend on\nthe name of the place as connected with the history of Mah\u00e1bali; whereas\nit will be shewn, when considering the inscriptions, that Mah\u00e1balipur is not\nits ancient designation; lastly, the omission of all mention of Mah\u00e1bali in\nthe inscriptions, and of any reference to him in the sculptures.\n\nAlthough I thus reject the account of the Brahmans on the spot, I have\nnothing certain to offer in its room. If a conjecture however may be\nhazarded regarding the origin of this place, I should be inclined to believe\nthat its sequestered situation and the picturesque position of the rocks and\ncaves induced certain Brahmans to obtain royal grants for founding an\nAgrah\u00e1ram here, and that, in order to increase the sanctity of their temples,\nthey from time to time employed stone-masons (several families of whom\nreside at Mah\u00e1malaipur, and appear to have worked the quarries of granite\ntime immemorial) to ornament the rocks with the excavations and sculptures\nwhich we now find.\n\nPlate 1, represents the sculptured rock, which has been described by\nMr. Goldingham in his second paragraph, as occupying a surface about\nninety feet in extent and thirty in height, and covered with figures in bas-\nrelief. This subject has been represented in Mrs. Graham's Journal by an\netching copied from an outline belonging to Col. Mackenzie, the inaccuracy\nof which will be sufficiently apparent on comparing it with my drawing,\nwhich was executed with much care and labour by my companion.\n\nDuring our visit to the Seven Pagodas, we caused the earth to be removed\nfrom the lower part of this rock to its base, and thus exposed to full view\nsome figures (see Pl. 2, No. 1), of which the heads alone were before visible.\n\nNot far from the rock last mentioned is the spacious chamber called the\nCrishn'a Man'd'apam, described by Mr. Goldingham in his third paragraph.\nOf the scene sculptured on the rock facing the entrance, Mr. Hudleston\nand myself made a joint drawing (see Pl. 2, No. 2); and as this rock\nis going fast to decay, owing to a spring of water from above, which keeps\nits surface constantly wet, it is not improbable that in the course of a few\nyears it will be entirely decomposed; it is the more desirable therefore\nthat some record of its subject should be preserved. Several interesting\nparticulars regarding the ancient Hindus may be gathered from this pastoral\nscene. The dress of the females resembles that now worn by the Nayris\nand Tirtis of Malabar, who are uncovered above the waist. The men, it\nappears, wore turbans, and the women very large ear-rings, with bangles on\ntheir hands and feet. The peculiar practice of carrying the infant on the hip, which cannot fail to attract the notice of Europeans at the present day, was then in use; and even the vertical arrangement and method of tying together the three earthen vessels here represented, is recognized by all Hindu visitors as being universally adopted by the modern Gop\u00eelas. The execution of this work is coarse, and the design rude; and though particular parts have much merit, yet the limbs of the principal figures are clumsy and ill-proportioned, the attitudes forced, and the countenances without expression.\n\nGreatly superior is the skill displayed by the artists employed in the excavation described by Mr. Goldingham in his fifth paragraph; but even here, under the same roof, there is much inequality in the execution of the different subjects. The central compartment (see Pl. 3, No. 1), and that on the left on entrance (see Pl. 3, No. 2) are tame performances, compared with the very spirited representation of Durg\u00e2 seated on her lion, and attacking Mah\u00e2s\u00e2sur, which occupies the right compartment. (See Pl. 4.) I have no hesitation in pronouncing this to be the most animated piece of Hindu sculpture which I have ever seen; and I would venture to recommend that a caste of it should, if possible, be taken for this Society. In the mean time, a tolerably just notion may be formed of its merits from the excellent and accurate delineation of Mr. Hudleston.\n\nThe smaller temple, which Mr. Goldingham mentions as placed at a considerable elevation above that just alluded to, and wrought out of a single mass of rock, is so rich in sculpture and ornament, and occupies so picturesque and sequestered a spot, that it is surprising he should have passed it over with so slight a notice. This excavation is in form a parallelogram, open on one of the longer sides, where it is supported on two columns. It contains four large compartments or panels of sculpture; namely, one at each end, and one on each side of the central recess opposite the entrance; besides two niches occupied by Dw\u00e2rap\u00e2las. The Var\u00e2ha Avat\u00e2ra represented in Plate 5, is placed at the left end of the chamber. Plate 6, the subject of which seems to be some incarnation of Vishnu, fills the compartment at the opposite end. On the right of the recess a female deity appears, surmounted by an umbrella (see Pl. 7, No. 1); whilst on the left is a female figure seated on a lotus throne, and attended by damsels who bear water-pots, to be discharged in turn over her head by the elephants seen in the back-ground (see Pl. 8.) The position of\nthe Dw\u00e1rap\u00e1la will be seen in Plate 8, No. 2. Of the columns which support the front of the excavation, as well as of the side pilasters I have thought it worth while, on account of their beauty and singular order, to furnish drawings (Pl. 7, Nos. 2 and 3); while the general appearance of the cave-temple will be best understood by reference to Plate 9.\n\nThere are several other pieces of sculpture contained in small temples among the rocks, not noticed either by Mr. Chambers or Mr. Goldingham; and of these, Plate 10, Nos. 1, 2, 3, are examples.\n\nThe D\u00f3l\u00f3tsava Man'd'apam, seen in the centre of the village, is remarkable for the lightness and elegance of its construction. It is of granite, and is supported on four columns, which rise from a platform elevated by three steps (see Pl. 11, No. 1). The shafts of the columns with the base are hewn from a single stone, and, including the capital, are twenty-seven feet in height.\n\nThe stone pagoda on the sea-shore, which serves as a land-mark for shipping, and is erroneously stated by Mr. Chambers to be built of brick, is delineated in Plate 11, No. 2; and the gigantic figure lying stretched on the floor in one of its recesses, in Plate 12. At the time when this drawing was made, the figure was enclosed in a small chamber; but on a subsequent visit I found that the walls had given way, thus leaving it exposed to the open air. As a record therefore of the state of this pagoda and figure, I regard these drawings as not without value in the collection now presented to the Society; for such is the dilapidated condition of this structure, that the period cannot be far distant when it will no longer exist. The effects of the salt-water spray add much to those of time in hastening its decay.\n\nWhether this pagoda was dedicated to Vishnu or to Siva, I regard as doubtful: tradition favours the former supposition. At all events, the pillar which stands before it amid the spray of the sea is certainly not a lingam, as some suppose, but merely the stambha or post, which is found, I believe, fronting all Hindu temples of consideration. That this pillar is now near the high-water mark is by no means a convincing proof that the sea has encroached here, for I see no reason why such a spot should not have been originally selected for its erection. If it be a fact, as mentioned by Bishop Heber, that the sea is receding from most other parts of the Coromandel coast, it is difficult to conceive why it should advance in this place; such a local encroachment could only be effected by a change in the\nposition of the land, and as the primitive rocks here appear on the surface, this cannot be admitted as a probable occurrence, unless under some violent convulsion of nature. Had the coast been of an alluvial formation at this spot, high tides might have advanced upon it with greater facility.\n\nThe five monolithic temples, situated about a mile to the southward of the village, have justly attracted the attention of all who have visited Mah\u00e1malaipur. They are called on the spot \u0930\u0925\u0903; Rat'h\u00e1s, or sacred vehicles: but it is obvious, that they were never meant as imitations of those enormous wooden structures, which are so conspicuous in certain Hindu processions. They were probably intended to serve the purpose of temples; but bear evident marks of having been left in an unfinished state; for though highly ornamented on the outside, they have not been excavated within, being merely solid masses of sculptured granite remaining in their original positions. For the general view of these Rat'h\u00e1s, I would refer to Mrs. Graham's plate, which, together with Mr. Goldingham's description, will serve to convey a notion of these curious remains of antiquity. Several of the basso relievo figures with which they are ornamented are represented in Plate 15, and will be further noticed when I come to speak of the inscriptions which are placed over them.\n\nOF THE INSCRIPTIONS.\n\nExclusively of a scrap of modern Telugu, very incorrectly designed and rudely sculptured on the floor of the Crishna Man'd'apam, and in consequence erroneously copied as ancient by Mr. Goldingham (see Asiatic Researches, vol. v. page 80), I noticed three kinds of inscriptions at Mah\u00e1malaipur, two of which have hitherto remained undeciphered. It is also highly probable that three other kinds, which I shall have occasion to mention, are to be met with in this neighbourhood.\n\nFirst. An ancient Tamul inscription is seen on a face of rock by the side of the inner entrance to the Var\u00e1ha Sw\u00e1mi pagoda, which is still in use. This would be legible throughout, were it not that a wall, which projects from the rock, cuts off a considerable portion of each line; on this account I did not consider it worth while to take a copy. From what remains visible, it is certain that the inscription records a grant to the Var\u00e1ha Sw\u00e1mi pagoda of a quantity of land, the boundaries of which are\nvery minutely defined, both as respects the property of others, and the cardinal points. The act of donation is attested by numerous witnesses, and the name of the donor is also mentioned. A perfect copy of this inscription might easily be made, if the wall which I have noticed were removed; and as the date might possibly thus be ascertained, I would suggest that the Madras Literary Society be recommended to take measures for effecting this object. In order to facilitate the task of decyphering this and similar records, I have drawn out an alphabet (see Pl. 13) from a careful collation of several ancient Tamil inscriptions.*\n\nAs it seems probable, from a passage in another ancient inscription hereafter noticed, that Mah\u00e1malaipur was a S'iva-St'hala, I am inclined to consider the Var\u00e1ha Sw\u00e1mi pagoda as quite distinct, and probably of a different era from the antiquities, properly so called, which belong to this place. The difference of language in the inscription, and the circumstance that the pagoda is a built structure projecting from the face of the rock,\n\n---\n\n* The changes which time has produced are in some letters very great; and where characters are so simple as those of the Tamil language, even slight alterations in form give rise to perplexity. I may adduce, as an example, the letter ca, the most ancient form of which was a Latin cross \\( \\text{T} \\). In the course of time a top was added to the left side, and the cross bar was curved thus \\( \\text{F} \\). The next alteration was in the addition of a perpendicular line falling from the left extremity of the top \\( \\text{F} \\). The top was then extended to the right \\( \\text{F} \\), and by prolonging the extremities of the curved line, the modern letter \\( \\text{F} \\) has at length been formed, or in a still more complicated manner as in the Grantha thus \\( \\text{F} \\). In its modern form \\( \\text{F} \\) it might easily be confounded with the \\( \\text{F} \\) which, though it now has a tail, was anciently written without one, thus \\( \\text{F} \\). Other examples might be given, but they suggest themselves on an inspection of the alphabet itself.\n\nI cannot touch on the subject of ancient Tamil characters without remarking, that their extreme simplicity seems one among many circumstances, which indicate that the language is of very high antiquity. The Sanscrit of the South of India is written in characters (the Grantha) derived from the Tamil, but they are much more complicated, and therefore probably posterior in point of antiquity. The peculiar structure of the Tamil language, wholly dissimilar from the Sanscrit, its deficiency in aspirated consonants, its possession of letters and sounds not found in Sanscrit, its division into dialects, one of which contains but few words of Sanscrit derivation; and lastly, its locality at the southern extremity of India, would seem likewise to indicate an independent origin, and one of at least equal antiquity with the Sanscrit itself; but this is a subject foreign to that now under consideration, and deserving a more lengthened discussion than the limits of a note will allow.\nand not an excavation, increase the probability of this conclusion. It is not unlikely, however, that there may exist in the sanctuary a subordinate sculpture representing the Var\u0101ha Avat\u0101ra, like that of C\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, and the Gop\u0101las in the C\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a Manidapam, and of equally ancient date, and that a roof and walls may have been thrown out from this rock, and a temple thus formed. The Brahmins on the spot did not permit me to enter the sanctuary to ascertain this point.\n\nThroughout this Tamil inscription the place is called Mah\u0101malai pur, which signifies the city of the great mountain, evidently with reference to the rocky eminence in the vicinity. This indeed cannot be called a great mountain on account of its size: but the word Mah\u0101 may refer to greatness of sanctity, or renown, with equal propriety.\n\nTo designate the village Mah\u0101-Bali-puram, the native name at the present day, is therefore an error, which has led to the assumption that this was the capital of that renowned giant Mah\u0101 Bali, whose kingdom, if it ever actually existed, was on the western coast of India, where he is still honoured by an annual festival.\n\nA second kind of character found at Mah\u0101malai pur is in a small monolithic pagoda,* now dedicated to G\u0101n\u0113\u015ba,\u2020 and situated on the north side of the hill. It is contained in an inscription (see Pl. 14) of considerable length, but is so faintly cut, and on such rough granite, that the facsimile which I have furnished, however imperfect, cost me several days' labour to trace.\u2021 One of the Jain Br\u0101hmans, in the employ of Col. Mac-\n\n---\n\n* Mrs. Graham gives an engraving of this small pagoda, which she says is called the Teer of Arjun, and she explains the word Teer (properly T\u0113r), to mean a place of religious retirement. The explanation is erroneous, as the word T\u0113r signifies, in Tamil, a car or sacred vehicle, corresponding with the Sanscrit Rat'ha.\n\n\u2020 When Mr. Goldingham wrote his account, this pagoda contained a lingam (see his first paragraph), so that it has passed from the S\u0101ivas into the possession of the Vaishnavas since that period. Brahman families of both sects reside on the spot.\n\n\u2021 In this character there are two forms of affix for long a, used indifferently as convenience may suggest. Thus, in the first stanza, we find the syllable (\u0915\u093e\u0930\u0923) c\u0101 in the word c\u0101ranam (\u0915\u093e\u0930\u0923\u092e) made thus \u0915\u093e\u0930\u0923; while in the eighth stanza the same syllable in the word c\u0101ma \u0915\u093e\u092e is made thus \u0915\u093e\u092e.\n\nThe letters p (\u092a), and s (\u0938) seem similar in form; but perhaps some slight difference may\nkenzie, had such a knowledge of ancient characters somewhat similar to this, that on visiting the spot with me, he succeeded in decyphering a great part of this inscription, the language of which is Sanscrit. The following is a translation of the ten slocas which were intelligible, while about two verses at the end were left undecyphered.\n\n1. May the cause of creation, existence and destruction, which is itself without cause, the destroyer of Manmadan (desire), be propitious to the desires of the world.\n\n2. May he who is united with Uma, of many kinds of illusion, without quality, the destroyer of evil dispositions, of incorruptible wealth, the Lord of Cuberan, be counted excellent.\n\n3. May that deity (Siva) protect us all, who is the seat of prosperity, and by whose means Caitasa disappeared and descended to Patala, yielding by its weight, which he caused on account of its being with (supported by) the ten-faced (Ravan'ana).\n\n4. May he who bears Siva in his mind engrossed by devotion, and the earth on his shoulders, with as much ease as if it were an ornament, long prevail.\n\n5. By that king of satisfied wishes, with crowds of conquered enemies, who is known by the name of Jayarana Sthambha, this building was made.\n\n6. May that fear-inspiring, good-giving, desire-destroying Siva, to whom the earth, space, the moon, fire, the sun, &c. are a body, be victorious.\n\n7. The good-faced among nations (the beauty of the world) sprung from a mother bringing forth heroes, remains without doubt in a place of lotuses, full of sacred waters, and is adorned with all sorts of precious stones.\n\n8 and 9. Siva, the beautiful, sits in the broad lake Siras, which teems with (literally is a mine of) lotuses resembling variegated gems, and is full of water for sprinkling the fortunate and much-loved Kamaraja,\n\nhave escaped my observation. In modern Grantha, an inflection in the middle of the character makes the difference between s and p, thus 221, 222. So also in the ancient character, the inflection may have been greater in the s than in the p, thus 221 and 222; but I have not upon this supposition felt authorized to depart from the copy which I made on the spot.\nwho puts down the pride of his enemies, who is the source (receptacle) of glory, and is earnest in worshipping Siva.\n\n10. He (Kamaraja) who dwells on the heads of kings, caused this temple of Siva, which resembles the temple on Cailasa, to be erected for the happiness of the earth.\n\nI have lately received from Madras two ancient inscriptions purporting to be from the neighbourhood of Mah\u00e1malaiipur, and two also have been kindly furnished me by Col. De Havilland. Of these four, two appear to be identical, which reduces the number to three. Their precise localities I have not the means of knowing, with the exception of one, entitled by Col. De Havilland, \"Sanscrit inscription engraven on the north side of the verandah of a pagoda excavated out of the solid granite, two miles north of Mahabalipuram.\" All these inscriptions differ in character from each other, but agree precisely in matter; and it is remarkable that the slokas of which they are composed are, with the exception of the last, contained, though in different order, in the inscription copied by me from the wall of the Ganesa pagoda and of which a translation has just been furnished. To state this more in detail, my inscription, which, it is to be observed, is in a character differing again from any of the rest, consists of ten slokas deciphered, besides as much as would probably make two slokas more remaining undeciphered. The other inscriptions consist of five slokas only, with some undeciphered portions, with which I have not thought it worth while to encumber the plate; the first four being in the metre called anushthubh, the last in a variety of the metre called vaitililya.\n\nThe first three slokas in my inscription are not found in the others; my fourth sloca is the same as theirs. The fifth, sixth, and seventh slokas of my inscription are wanting in the others. My eighth and ninth slokas are their first and second, and my tenth is their third. Their fifth sloca I have ascertained, after a very careful comparison, to be quite different from the remaining undeciphered portion of my inscription. Its translation is as follows: \"Atiranachandra (he who in battle is very furious), Lord of Kings, built this place called Atiranachandesvara. May Siva, the beloved, accompanied by the daughter (Parvati) of the snowy mountain, by Cartic\u00e9ya, and their suite of deities, be present in it for ever.\"\n\nThese inscriptions are peculiarly valuable, as giving us at once four different kinds of Sanscrit writing, whereof two (Pl. 14 and Pl. 15, No. 1.)\nare, in my opinion, ancient forms of the Grantha, or that character in which Sanscrit is invariably written in the South of India, and in which alone I was able to procure books for study at Madras. The other two will probably be considered as species of ancient D\u00e9van\u00e1gari. (See Pl. 15, No. 2 and 3.)\n\nThis variety of character, with identity of matter, leads me to think it probable that the inscription itself was a kind of general proclamation sculptured in different places, and modified, as in my inscription, to render it applicable to local circumstances. Whether it will throw light upon the history of Mah\u00e1malaipur, containing as it does the name of the sovereign who founded the temples to which it has been affixed, is a question which I must leave to be examined by those who have studied the ancient dynasties of the South of India.\n\nA third kind of character at Mah\u00e1malaipur, or a sixth kind, if we reckon those received from Madras and from Col. De Havilland, is to be found in the inscriptions over the basso-relievo figures which ornament the monolithic pogodas already mentioned as situated to the southward of the village, and of which several are represented in Plate 16. Neither the Jain Brahman employed by Col. Mackenzie, nor any other native of India who had seen these inscriptions, was able to decypher them, or to offer any conjecture as to the language in which they were written; and even the learned Mr. Ellis, after repeated visits to this place, was equally unsuccessful in his endeavours. Mrs. Graham, indeed, states that Col. Mackenzie had found a Brahman who read the character so as to pronounce the sounds, but did not understand the language they express. Whether any person did actually thus impose on that gentleman, or whether Mrs. Graham has confounded these inscriptions with the last, I cannot determine, but it is quite certain that, if any person had been able to decypher the character, he would, without any difficulty, have discovered the language to be Sanscrit. It was by assuming this to be the case, that I succeeded in decyphering these inscriptions.*\n\nI beg now to lay them before the Society, together with a transcript in D\u00e9van\u00e1gari, and a translation. (See Plate 17.)\n\n* There is one instance, as will be seen on a reference to Plate 17, in which the characters are of the same kind as those in the inscription of the G\u00e1n\u00e9s\u00e1 Pagoda, a proof that both were in use at the same period. It is probable therefore that one was the round, and the other the square form, analogous to the two varieties of P\u00e1li and Ariyam.\n| Tamil Characters | Meaning |\n|-----------------|---------|\n| \u0baa\u0bc2          |                |\n| \u0b9a\u0bcc          |                |\n| \u0b95\u0bb5\u0bbe\u0bc7        |                |\n| \u0bb5\u0b9e\u0bc7          |                |\n| \u0ba4\u0b9e\u0bc7          |                |\n| \u0ba8\u0b9e\u0bc7          |                |\n| \u0bae\u0b9e\u0bc7          |                |\n| \u0baf\u0b9e\u0bc7         |                |\n| \u0bb0\u0b9e\u0bc7         |                |\n| \u0bae\u0b9e\u0bc7          |                |\n| \u0baf\u0b9e\u0bc7         |                |\n| \u0bb0\u0b9e\u0bc7         |                |\n| \u0bae\u0b9e\u0bc7          |                |\n| \u0baf\u0b9e\u0bc7         |                |\n| \u0bb0\u0b9e\u0bc7         |                |\n| \u0bae\u0b9e\u0bc7          |                |\n| \u0baf\u0b9e\u0bc7         |                |\n| \u0bb0\u0b9e\u0bc7         |                |\n| \u0bae\u0b9e\u0bc7          |                |\n| \u0baf\u0b9e\u0bc7         |                |\n| \u0bb0\u0b9e\u0bc7         |                |\n| \u0bae\u0b9e\u0bc7          |                |\n| \u0baf\u0b9e\u0bc7         |                |\n| \u0bb0\u0b9e\u0bc7         |                |\n| \u0bae\u0b9e\u0bc7          |                |\n| \u0baf\u0b9e\u0bc7         |                |\n| \u0bb0\u0b9e\u0bc7         |                |\n| \u0bae\u0b9e\u0bc7          |                |\n\n**Sources**\n\n* *Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society*\n* *Journal of the Asiatic Society*\n| Original | The same in Devanagari | English Translation |\n|----------|------------------------|--------------------|\n| \u0915\u093e\u092e\u0932\u094d\u0915\u093f\u0928\u0903 \u0938\u092e\u0947\u092f\u092d\u093e\u092f\u0903 | \u0915\u093e\u092e\u0932\u094d\u0915\u093f\u0928\u0903 \u0938\u092e\u0947\u092f\u092d\u093e\u092f\u0903 | Dallying as Cama - of incomprehensible delusion |\n| \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f\u092a\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u0903 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0928\u0930\u0938\u093f\u0902\u0939\u0903 | \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f\u092a\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u0903 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0928\u0930\u0938\u093f\u0902\u0939\u0903 | The holy Man-Lion - of irresistible authority |\n| \u092e\u0941\u0935\u0928\u092d\u093e\u091c\u0928\u0903 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092e\u0947\u0927\u0903 | \u092e\u0941\u0935\u0928\u092d\u093e\u091c\u0928\u0903 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092e\u0947\u0927\u0903 | The Mundane Vejal - The sacred cloud |\n| \u0938\u093f\u0930\u092e\u0915\u0903 \u092e\u0926\u0928\u092d\u093f\u0930\u093e\u092e\u0903 | \u0938\u093f\u0930\u092e\u0915\u0903 \u092e\u0926\u0928\u092d\u093f\u0930\u093e\u092e\u0903 | The firm in faith - The beautiful as Cama - Deva |\n| \u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093f | \u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093f | The Agent - (a name of Vishnu) |\n| \u0935\u093f\u092d\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0928\u0903 | \u0935\u093f\u092d\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0928\u0903 | The confused |\n| \u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f | \u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f | The elegant |\n| \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u0928\u093f\u0927\u093f | \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u0928\u093f\u0927\u093f | The abode of prosperity |\n| \u0928\u093f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0903 | \u0928\u093f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0903 | The unanswerable |\n| \u0928\u092f\u0928\u092e\u0928\u094b\u0939\u0903 | \u0928\u092f\u0928\u092e\u0928\u094b\u0939\u0903 | The delight of the eyes |\n| \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0924\u094b\u092d\u0926\u0903 | \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0924\u094b\u092d\u0926\u0903 | The universally benevolent |\n| \u0932\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0924 | \u0932\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0924 | The Lovely |\n| \u0938\u0924\u094d\u092f\u092a\u0930\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e\u0903 | \u0938\u0924\u094d\u092f\u092a\u0930\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e\u0903 | The truly valorous |\n| \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u0928\u0930\u0938\u093f\u0902\u0939\u0903 | \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u0928\u0930\u0938\u093f\u0902\u0939\u0903 | The holy Man-Lion (Vishnu's 1st Avatara) |\n| \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0903 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092e\u0930\u0903 | \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0903 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092e\u0930\u0903 | Bharah - (a name of Vishnu) the sacred cherisher |\n| \u092e\u0941\u0935\u0928\u092d\u093e\u091c\u0928\u0903 | \u092e\u0941\u0935\u0928\u092d\u093e\u091c\u0928\u0903 | The Mundane Vejal |\n| \u092a\u0930\u093e\u0935\u0930\u0903 | \u092a\u0930\u093e\u0935\u0930\u0903 | The Lord - (a word in use in the South of India) |\n| \u092d\u092f\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0903 | \u092d\u092f\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0903 | The terrible destroyer |\n| \u0935\u093e\u092e\u0903 | \u0935\u093e\u092e\u0903 | The crooked.

At the same time we should remember that their brevity and position, having led to the assumption that they were names of deities, thus rendered the task of deciphering them somewhat less difficult. Unimportant as they are in themselves, a knowledge of them may lead to the acquirement of useful or curious information to be drawn from other sources, and I trust that the Society will indulgently consider the utility of this research, not so much with reference to the information actually obtained, as to its general subserviency to the purposes of history.\n\nThere are certainly no historical monuments in India more decidedly authentic than the copper and stone inscriptions found in such abundance in many parts of the country, and it is advancing one step to have determined that these, however different the characters in which they are sculptured from those in use at the present day, are all in the Sanscrit language, in which so little change has taken place in the lapse of ages, that, when once we have succeeded in the task of deciphering, all difficulty is at an end, and the record of a remote antiquity is placed intelligibly before us.\n\nThese inscriptions, and those at Kenerah in the island of Salsette, one of which, with the modern Sanscrit, and a translation, I laid before the Society on a late occasion, are perhaps the most ancient, at least the most dissimilar from characters at present in use, which I have met with; and I think myself therefore warranted in concluding that there are no inscriptions of Hindu origin to be found in India which may not, by attentive study, be deciphered, and by the assistance of learned natives, afterwards interpreted.\n\nWith a view to rendering the characters of these deciphered inscriptions generally applicable, I have added two tables (Pl. 18): the one containing all the characters found in the inscription in the G\u00e1n\u00e9s\u00e1 Pagoda; the other, those met with over the basso-r\u00e9lievo figures on the Rat\u1e25as.\nXV. On the Religious Establishments of Mewar.* By Lieut.-Colonel James Tod, M.R.A.S.\n\nRead December 6, 1828.\n\nIn all ages the ascendancy of the hierarchy is observable; it is a tribute paid to religion through her organs. Could the lavish endowments and extensive immunities of the various religious establishments in Rajast'han be assumed as criteria of the morality of the inhabitants, we should be authorized to assign them a high station in the scale of excellence. But they more frequently prove the reverse of this position; especially the territorial endowments, often the fruits of a death-bed repentance,\u2020 which, prompted by superstition or fear, compounds for past crimes by posthumous profusion, although vanity not rarely lends her powerful aid. There is scarcely a state in Rajpootana in which at least one-fifth of the soil is not assigned for the support of temples, their ministers, the secular Brahmans, bards, and genealogists. But the evil was not always so extensive; the abuse is of modern growth.\n\nAn anecdote related of the Rajas of Marwar and Amb\u00e9r, always rivals in war, love, and folly, will illustrate the motives of these dismemberments.\n\n* It is unnecessary to say more of Mewar in this place, than that it is the most ancient and most respected of all the Rajput principalities; its prince is the chief of the whole Rajput race, and the pre-eminence of his illustrious descent is universally admitted. From their migration out of the north of India and settlement in Saurashtra in the second century, we can trace the vicissitudes of their fortunes to the present time, and as their country was less infested by Mahommedan conquerors, it offers a better picture of Hinduism than any other portion of India.\n\n\u2020 Menu commands, \"Should the king be near his end through some incurable disease, he must bestow on the priests all his riches accumulated from legal fines: and having duly committed his kingdom to his son, let him seek death in battle, or, if there be no war, by abstaining from food.\"\u2014Chap. ix., p. 337, Haughton's Edition. The annals of all the Rajput States afford instances of obedience to this text of their divine legislator.\nDuring the annual pilgrimage to the sacred lake of Poshkur, it is the custom for these lords of the earth to weigh their persons against all that is rare, in gold, gems, and precious cloths; which are afterwards distributed to the priests under the misnomer of khyrat or charity. The Amb\u00e9r chief had the advantage of a full treasury and a fertile soil; to which his rival could oppose a more extended sway over a braver race, but his country was proverbially poor; and at Poshkur, the weight of the purse ranks above the deeds of the sword. As these princes were suspended in the scale, the Amb\u00e9r Raja, who was balanced against the more costly material, indirectly taunted his brother-in-law on the poverty of his offerings, who would gladly, like the Roman, have made up the deficiency with his sword. But the Marwar prince had a minister of tact, at whose suggestion he challenged his rival (of Amb\u00e9r) to equal him in the magnitude of his gift to the Brahmans. On the gage being accepted, the Rahtore exclaimed, \"Perpetual charity (Sahsuna) of all the lands held by the Brahmans in Marwar!\" His unreflecting rival had commenced the redemption of his pledge, when his minister stopped the half-uttered vow, which would have impoverished the family for ever; for there were ten Brahmans in Amb\u00e9r who followed secular employments, cultivating or holding lands in usufruct, to one in Marwar. Had these lords of the earth been left to their misguided vanity, the fisc (Khalisa) of each state would have been seriously curtailed.\n\nThe Brahmans, Sanyasis, and Gos\u00e1ens, are not behind those professional flatterers, the Bards; and many a princely name would have been forgotten but for the record of the gift of land. In M\u00e9war, the lands in Sahsin, or religious grants, amount in value to one-fifth of the revenue of the state, and the greater proportion of these has arisen out of the prodigal mismanagement of the last century. The dilapidated state of the country on the general pacification in A.D. 1818, afforded a noble opportunity to redeem in part these alienations, without the penalty of denunciation attached to the resumer of sacred charities. But death, famine, and exile, which had left but few of the grantees in a capacity to return and re-occupy the lands, in vain coalesced to restore the fisc of M\u00e9war. The Rana dreaded a \"sixty thousand years' residence in hell,\" and some of the finest land of his country is doomed to remain unproductive. In this predicament is the township of Myn\u00e1r, with 50,000 bigahs (16,000 acres), which, with the exception of a nook in which some few have established themselves, claiming to be descendants of the original holders, are condemned to sterility, owing to the\nagricultural proprietors and the rent-receiving Brahmans being dead; and apathy united to superstition admits their claims without inquiry.\n\nThe antiquary who has dipped into the records of the dark period in European church history, can have ocular illustration in Rajast'han of traditions which may in Europe appear questionable. The vision of the Bishop of Orleans,* who saw Charles Martel in the depths of hell, undergoing the tortures of the damned, for having stripped the churches of their possessions, \"thereby rendering himself guilty of the sins of all those who had endowed them,\" would receive implicit credence from every Hindu, whose ecclesiastical economy might both yield and derive illustration from a comparison, not only with that of Europe, but with the more ancient Egyptian and Jewish systems, whose endowments, as explained by Moses and Ezekiel, bear a strong analogy to those of the Hindus. The disposition of landed property in Egypt was, as amongst the ancient Hindus, immorally vested in the cultivator; and it was only through Joseph's ministry in the famine, that \"the land became Pharaoh's, for the Egyptians sold every man his field.\"\u2020 And the coincidence is manifest even in the tax imposed on them as occupants of their ancient inheritance (wutun), being one-fifth of the crops to the king, while the maximum rate among the Hindus is a sixth.\u00a7 The Hindus also, in visitations such as occasioned the dispossession of the ryots of Egypt, can mortgage or sell their patrimony (bapota). Joseph did not attempt to infringe the privileges of the sacred order when the whole of Egypt became crown-land, \"except the lands of the priests which became not Pharaoh's,\" and these priests, according to Diodorus, held for themselves and the sacrificers no less than one-third of the lands of Egypt. But we learn from Herodotus that Sesostris, who ruled after Joseph's\n\n* Saint-Eucher, \u00e9v\u00eaque d'Orl\u00e9ans, eut une vision qui \u00e9tonna les princes.

This is, however, an innovation, since, formerly, princes never granted with territorial assignments the prerogative of dispensing justice, of levying transit duties, or exemption from personal service of the feudal tenant who held on the land thus assigned. Well may Rajp\u00fat heirs exclaim with the grandson of Clovis, \"our exchequer is impoverished, and our riches are transferred to the clergy.\"|| But Chilperic had the courage to recall the grants of his predecessors, which, however, the pious Gontram re-established. Many Gontrams could be found, though but few Chilperics, in Rajast'han: we have, indeed, one in Jograz, the Rana's ancestor, almost a contemporary of the Merovingian king, who not only resumed all the lands of the Brahmins, but put many of them to death, and expelled the rest his dominions.\u00a7 It may be doubted whether vanity and shame be not sufficient in themselves to prevent a resumption of the lands of the Mangtas or mendicants (as they style all those \"who extend the palm,\" Brahmins and bards), without the dreaded penalty, which operates very slightly on the sub-vassal or cultivator, who, having no superfluity, defies their anathemas when they attempt to wrest from him, by virtue of the crown grant, any of his long-established rights. By these the threat of impure transmigration is despised; and the Brahman may spill his blood on the threshold of his dwelling or in the field in dispute, which will be relinquished by the owner but with his life.

With grant in hand he hastened to the Jat proprietor, and desired him to make over to him the patch of land. The latter coolly replied that he would give him all the prince had a right to, namely, the tax. The Brahman threatened to spill his own blood if he did not obey the command, and gave himself a gash in a limb; but the Jat was inflexible, and declared that he would not surrender his patrimony (bapota) even if he slew himself.* In short, the ryot of Mewar would reply, even to his sovereign, if he demanded his field, in the very words of Naboth to Ahab, king of Israel, when he demanded the vineyard contiguous to the palace: \"The Lord forbid it me that I should give the inheritance of my fathers (bapota) unto thee.\"\n\nBut the tythes, and other small and legally established rights of the hierarchy, are still religiously maintained. The village temple and the village priest are always objects of veneration to the industrious husbandman, on whom superstition acts more powerfully than on the bold marauding Rajput, who hesitates not to demand salvamenta (rekwali) from the lands of Kaniya or Eklinga. But the poor ryot of the nineteenth century of Vicrama has the same fears as the peasants of Charlemagne, who were made to believe that the ears of corn found empty had been devoured by infernal spirits, who were reported to have said they owed their feast to the non-payment of tythes.\u2020 The political influence of the Brahmans is\n\n* These worshippers of God and Mammon, when threats fail, have recourse to maiming, and even destroying themselves, to gain their object. In 1820 one of the confidential servants of the Rana demanded payment of the petty tax called gugri, of one rupee on each house, from some Brahmans who dwelt in the village, and which had always been received from them. They refused payment, and on being pressed, four of them stabbed themselves mortally. Their bodies were placed upon biers, and funeral rites withheld till punishment should be inflicted on the priest-killer. But for once superstition was disregarded, and the rights of the Brahmans in this community were resumed.\u2014See Appendix to this paper, No. I.\n\n\u2020 Mais le bas peuple n'est gu\u00e8re capable d'abandonner ses int\u00e9r\u00eats par des exemples.

He left a curious piece of advice to his successors, inculcating vigorous measures.\n\"With two thousand men you may eat khitchri; with one thousand dalb'hat; with five hundred\nj\u00fati, (the shoe). Khitchri is a savoury mess of pulse, rice, butter, and spices; Dalb'hat is\nsimple rice and pulse; the Shoe, is indelible disgrace.\n\n\u2020 Menu, in his rules on government, commands the king to impart his momentous counsel and\nentrust all transactions to a learned and distinguished Brahman. Chap. vii. p. 195.\n\nThere is, no being more aristocratic in his ideas than the secular Brahman or priest, who deems\nthe bare name a passport to respect. The K\u00e1lun Brahman of Bengal piques himself upon this\ntitle of nobility granted by the last Hindu king of Canouj (whence they migrated to Bengal),\nand in virtue of which his alliance in matrimony is courted. But although Menu has imposed\nobligations towards the Brahman little short of adoration, these are limited to the \"learned in\nthe V\u00e9das:\" he classes the unlearned Brahman with \"an elephant made of wood, or an antelope\nof leather;\" nullities, save in name. And he adds further, that \"as liberality to a fool is\nuseless, so is a Brahman useless if he read not the holy texts:\" comparing the person who gives\nto such an one, to a husbandman \"who, sowing seed in a barren soil, reaps no gain;\" so, the\nBrahman \"obtains no reward in heaven.\" These sentiments are repeated in numerous texts,\nholding out the most powerful inducements to the sacerdotal class to cultivate their minds, since\ntheir power consists solely in their wisdom. For such, there are no privileges too extensive,\nno homage too great. \"A king, even though dying with want, must not receive any tax from\na Brahman learned in the V\u00e9das.\" His person is sacred. \"Never shall the king slay a Brahman,\nthough convicted of all possible crimes,\" is a premium at least to unbounded insolence, and\nunfits them for members of society, more especially for soldiers: banishment, with person and\nproperty untouched, is the declared punishment for even the most heinous crimes. \"A Brah-\nman may seize without hesitation, if he be distressed for a subsistence, the goods of his S\u00fadra\nslave.\" But the following text is the climax: \"What prince could gain wealth by oppressing\nthese [Brahmans], who, if angry, could frame other worlds, and regents of worlds, and could\ngive birth to new gods and mortals?\"\u2014Menu, chaps. ii, iii, vii, viii, ix.\nevery influential domestic, takes advantage of ephemeral favour to increase the endowments of his tutelary divinity. The Pundits Purdhans, or Peshwa ministers of Satarra, are the most striking out of numerous examples.\n\nIn the dark ages of Europe the monks are said to have prostituted their knowledge of writing to the forging of charters in their own favour: a practice not easily detected in the days of ignorance.* The Brahmins, in like manner, do not scruple to employ this method of augmenting the wealth of their shrines; and superstition and indolence combine to favour the deception. There is not a doubt that the grand charter of Nat'hdwara was a forgery, in which the prince's butler was bribed to aid; and report alleges that the Rana secretly favoured an artifice which regard to opinion prevented him from overtly promulgating. Although the copper-plate had been buried under ground, and came out disguised with a coating of verdigrise, there were marks which proved the date of its execution to be false. I have seen charters which, it has been gravely asserted, were granted by Rama upwards of 3,000 years ago! Such is the alleged origin of one found in a well at the ancient Brimpuri, in the valley of Udyapur (Oodipoor). If there be sceptics as to its validity they are silent ones, and this copper-plate of the brazen age is worth gold to the proprietor.\u2020 A census \u2021 of the three central districts of Mewar discovered that more than 20,000 acres of these fertile lands, irrigated by the Beris and Bunas rivers, were distributed in isolated portions, of which the mendicant (Mangta) castes had the chief share, and which proved fertile sources of dispute to the husbandman and the officers of the revenue. From the mass of title-deeds of every description by which these lands were held, one deserves to be selected, on account of its being pretended to have been written and bestowed on the incumbent's ancestor by the deity upwards of three centuries ago, and which has been maintained as a bona-fide grant of Krishna || ever since. By such credulity and apathy are the Rajput states influenced: yet let the reader check any rising\n\n* Hallam's Middle Ages, vol. i. page 204.\n\u2020 These forgeries of charters cannot be considered as invalidating the arguments drawn from them, as we may rest assured nothing is introduced foreign to custom, in the items of the deeds.\n\u2021 Suggested by the author, and executed under his superintendence, who waded through all these documents, and translated upwards of a hundred of the most curious.\n|| See the Appendix to this paper, No. II.\nfeeling of contempt for Hindu legislation, and cast a retrospective glance at the page of European church history, where he will observe in the time of the most potent of our monarchs that the clergy possessed one-half of the soil:* and the chronicles of France will shew him Charlemagne on his death-bed, bequeathing two-thirds of his domains to the church, deeming the remaining third sufficient for the ambition of four sons. The same dread of futurity, and the hope to expiate the sins of a life, at its close, by gifts to the organs of religion, is the motive for these unwise alienations, whether in Europe or in Asia. Some of these establishments, and particularly that at Nat'hdwara, made a proper use of their revenues in keeping up the Sudda Birt, or perpetual charity, though it is chiefly distributed to religious pilgrims: but among the many complaints made of the misapplication of the funds, the diminution of this hospitable rite is one; while at other shrines the avarice of the priests is observable, in the coarseness of the food dressed for sacrifice and offering.\n\nBesides the crown-grants to the greater establishments, the Brahmans received petty tythes from the agriculturist, and a small duty from the trader as mappa or metage throughout every township, corresponding with the scale of the village chapel. An inscription found by the author at the town of Palode,\u2020 and dated nearly seven centuries back, affords a good specimen of the claims of the village priesthood. The following are among the items. The sirano, or a sir in every maund, being the fortieth part of the grain of the \u00ednd\u00e1\u00fa, or summer harvest; the kirpa, or a bundle from every sheaf of the autumnal crops, whether mukhi (Indian corn), bajra or jo\u00e1r (maize), or the other grains peculiar to that season.\u2021\n\nThey also derive a tythe from the oil-mill and sugar-mill, and receive a khansa or platter of food on all rejoicings, as births, marriages, &c., with churaie, or the right of pasturage on the village common; and where they have become possessed of landed property, they have hulmoh, or unpaid labour in man, beasts, and implements, for its culture\u2014an exaction well known in Europe as one of the detested corv\u00e9es of the feudal system in France;|| and the abolition of which was the sole boon the English husbandman obtained by the charter of Runymede.

Iswara is adored under the epithet of Eklinga,* and is either worshipped in his monolithic symbol, the lingam or phallus, or as Iswara Chaomukhi, the quadriform divinity, represented by a bust with four (ch\u00e1o) faces (m\u00falh). The sacred bull (Nanda) has his altar attached to all the shrines of Iswara, as was that of Mneves or Apis to those of the Egyptian Osiris, worshipped on the Nile, as in M\u00e9war, under his emblem, the phallus. Nanda has occasionally his separate shrines, and there is one in the valley of Udyap\u00far whose reputation is oracular as regards the seasons. The bull was the steed of Iswara, and carried him in battle. He is often represented with his consort Isa at full speed on the bull. I will not stop to inquire whether the Grecian fable of the rape of Europa\u2020 by the tauriform Jupiter, as well as the Jupiter Serapis, the Osiris, Lord of Apis, of the Egyptians, may\n\n* That is, with one (ek) lingam or phallus\u2014the symbol of worship being a single cylindrical or conical stone. There are others, termed Sehelinga and Kot-iswara, with a thousand or a million of phallic representatives, all minutely carved on the monolithic emblem, having then much resemblance to the symbol of Bacchus, whose orgies both in Egypt and Greece are the counterpart of those of the Hindu Bagh-es, thus called from being clad in a tiger's or leopard's hide: Bacchus had the panther's for his covering. There is a very ancient temple to Kotiswara at the embouchure of the eastern arm of the Indus; and there are many to Seh\u00e9s-Linga in the peninsula of Saurashtra.\n\n\u2020 It might have appeared fanciful, some time ago, to have given a Sanscrit derivation to a Greek proper name: but Europa might be derived from Shr\u00fapa\u2014\"of the beautiful face\"\u2014the initial syllable su and eu having the same signification in both languages, viz. good\u2014R\u00fapa is 'countenance.'\nnot, with much more of their mythology, be derived from the Hindu pantheon; whether that pantheon was originally erected on the Indus or the Ganges, or the more central scene of early civilization, the banks of the Oxus. The bull was offered to Mithras by the Persian, and opposed as it now appears to Hindu faith, he formerly bled on the altars of the Sun-god (Bal-iswara), on which not only the Buld-d\u00e1n* (offering of the bull) was made, but human sacrifices.\u2020 We do not learn that the Egyptian priesthood presented the kindred of Apis to Osiris, but as they were not prohibited from eating beef, they may have done so. These mythological analogies in ancient idolatrous worship can scarcely be deemed fortuitous; but as the subject will be resumed in describing the festival of Isvara and Isa (Osiris and Isis) at Udyap\u00far, we shall not pursue it further at present.\n\nThe shrine of Eklinga is situated in a defile about six miles north of Udyap\u00far. The hills towering around it on all sides are of the primitive formation, and their scarped summits are clustered with honeycombs.\u2021 There are abundant small springs of water which keep verdant numerous shrubs, the\n\n---\n\n* \"In this sacrifice four altars are erected, for offering the flesh to the four gods, Lacschmi-Narayana, Uma-Mecheswar, Brimha, and Anunta.

Five Vilwa, five Khudiru, five Pulasu, and five Udumbiru posts are to be erected, and a bull tied to each post.

Animals, as goats, sheep, &c., are tied to the posts, and to one or them, of the wood of the mimosa, is to be tied the human victim. Fire is to be kindled by means of a burning glass. The sacrificing priest (hota) strews the grass called dh\u016bb or immortal, round the sacred fire. Then follows the burnt sacrifice to the ten guardian deities of the earth\u2014to the nine planets, and to the Hindu Triad, to each of whom clarified butter is poured on the sacred fire one thousand times. Another burnt-sacrifice, to the sixty-four inferior gods follows, which is succeeded by the sacrifice and offering of all the other animals tied to the posts. The human sacrifice concludes; the sacrificing priest offering pieces of the flesh of the victim to each god as he circumambulates the altar. Ibid. 260.\n\n\u2021 This is to be taken in its literal sense; the economy of the bee being displayed in the formation of extensive colonies, which inhabit large masses of black comb adhering to the summits of the rocks. According to the legends of these tracts they were called in as auxiliaries on Mahommedan invasions, and are said to have thrown the enemy more than once into confusion.\nflowers of which are acceptable to the deity; especially the *k\u00e9n\u00e9r* or oleander, which grows in great luxuriance on the Aravulli. Groves of bamboo and mango were formerly common, according to tradition; but although it is deemed sacrilege to thin the groves of B\u00c1L,* the bamboo has been nearly destroyed: there are, however, still many trees sacred to the god scattered around. It would be difficult to convey a just idea of a temple so complicated in its detail. It is of the form commonly styled pagoda, and like all the ancient temples of Siva, its *sikra*, or pinnacle, is pyramidal. The various orders of Hindu sacred architecture are distinguished by the form of the *sikra*, which is the portion springing from and surmounting the perpendicular walls of the body of the temple. The *sikra* of those of Siva is invariably pyramidal, and its sides vary with the base, whether square or oblong. The apex is crowned with an ornamental figure, as a sphynx, an urn, a ball, or a lion, which is called the *kullus*. When the *sikra* is but the frustrum of a pyramid, it is often surmounted by a row of lions, as at Bijolli. The fane of Eklinga is of white marble and of ample dimensions. Under an open-vaulted temple supported by columns, and fronting the four-faced divinity, is the brazen bull, Nanda, of the natural size; it is cast, and of excellent proportions. The figure is perfect, except where the shot or hammer of an infidel invader has penetrated its hollow flank in search of treasure. Within the quadrangle are miniature shrines, containing some of the minor divinities.\u2020 The high-priest of Eklinga, like all his order, is doomed to celibacy, and the office is continued by adopted disciples. Of such spiritual descents they calculate sixty-four since the Sage\n\n---\n\n* See Appendix to this paper, No. IV.\n\n\u2020 In June 1806 I was present at a meeting between the Rana and Sindia at the shrine of Eklinga. The rapacious Mahratta had just forced the passes to the Rana's capital, which was the commencement of a series of aggressions involving one of the most tragic events in the history of M\u00e9war\u2014the immolation of the Princess Kishna and the subsequent ruin of the country. I was then an Attach\u00e9 of the British embassy to the Mahratta prince, who carried the ambassador to the meeting to increase his consequence. In March 1818 I again visited the shrine on my way to Udyap\u00e1r, but under very different circumstances\u2014to announce the deliverance of the family from oppression, and to labour for its prosperity. While standing without the sanctuary looking at the quadriform divinity, and musing on the changes of the intervening twelve years, my meditations were broken by an old Rajp\u00fat chieftain, who, saluting me, invited me to enter and adore \"Baba Adam,\" Father Adam, as he termed the phallic emblem. I excused myself on account of my boots, which I said I could not remove, and that with them I would not cross the threshold\u2014a reply which pleased him, and preceded me to the Rana's court.\nHarita, whose benediction obtained for the Gehlote Rajp\u00fat the sovereignty of Chitore, when successively driven from Saurashtra by the Parthians, and from Edur by the Bhils.\n\nThe priests of Eklinga are termed Gosa\u00e9n or Goswami, which signifies \"control over the senses!\"* The distinguishing mark of the faith of Siva is the crescent on the forehead;\u2020 the hair is braided and forms a tiara round the head, and with its folds a chaplet of the lotus seed is often entwined. They smear the body with ashes, and use garments dyed of an orange hue. They bury their dead frequently in a sitting posture, and erect tumuli over them, which are generally conical in form.\u00a7 It is far from uncommon to have priestesses officiating in the temple of Siva. There is a numerous class of Gosa\u00e9ns who have adopted celibacy, and who yet follow secular employments both in commerce and arms. The mercantile Gosa\u00e9ns are amongst the richest individuals in India, and there are several at Udyap\u00far who enjoy high favour, and who were found very useful when the Mahrattas demanded a war-contribution, as their privileged character did not prevent their being offered and taken as hostages for its payment. The Gosa\u00e9ns who profess arms, partake of the character of the knights of St. John of Jerusalem. They live in monasteries scattered over the country, possess lands, and beg, or serve for pay when called upon. As defensive soldiers they are good. Siva, their patron, is the god of war, and like him they make great use of intoxicating herbs, and even of spirituous liquors. In M\u00e9war they can always muster many hundreds of the Kanfera Jogi, or \"split-ear ascetic,\" so called from the habit of piercing the ear and placing therein a ring of the conch-shell, which is their battle-trumpet. Both Brahmans and Rajp\u00fats, and even G\u00fajurs, can belong to this order, a particular account of whose internal discipline and economy could not fail to be interesting. The poet Chand gives an animated description of the body-guard \u00a7 of the King of Canouj, which was composed of these monastic warriors.\n\n* This word is compounded of go, the senses, and sa\u00e9n or swami, lord or master.\n\u2020 Siva is represented with three eyes. Hence his title of Trinitra and Tri-lochun, the Tri-opthalmic Jupiter of the Greeks. From the fire of the central eye of Siva is to proceed Pralaya, or the final destruction of the universe.\n\u2021 I have seen a cemetery of these, each of very small dimensions, which may be described as so many concentric rings of earth, diminishing to the apex, crowned with a cylindrical stone pillar. One of the disciples of Siva was performing rites to the manes, strewing leaves of an evergreen and sprinkling water over the graves.\n\u00a7 For a minute description of this, vide \"Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society,\" vol. i, p. 217.\nThe Rana of M\u00e9war, as the d\u00e9wan or vicegerent of Siva, when he goes to the temple supersedes the high priest in his duties, and performs the ceremonies with peculiar correctness and grace.*\n\nThe shrine of Eklinga is endowed with twenty-four large villages from the khalisa or fisc, besides parcels of land from the chieftains; but the privileges of the tutelary divinity have been waning since Kaniya fixed his residence amongst them: and as the priests of Apollo complained that the god was driven from the sacred mount Girdhana, in Vrij, by the influence of those of Jupiter\u2020 with Shah Jehan, the latter may now lament that the day of retribution has arrived, when propitiation to the Preserver and Mediator is deemed more important than to the Creator or Destroyer. This may arise from the personal character of the high priests, who, as from their vicinity to the court they can scarcely avoid mingling in its intrigues, so they cannot fail to lose in character both there and with the inferior classes: even the Ranis do not hesitate to take mortgages on the estates of B'holanat'hi.\u2021\n\nWe shall not further enlarge on the immunities to Eklinga, or the forms in which they are conveyed, as these will be fully discussed in the account of the shrine of Krishna; but proceed to notice the privileges of the heterodox Jains\u2014the V\u00e9dav\u00e1n\u00a7 or Magi of Rajast'han.\n\nThe numbers and power of these sectarians are little known to Europeans, who take it for granted that they are few and dispersed. To prove the extent of their religious and political power, it will suffice to remark, that the pontiff of the Khartra-gatcha,|| one of the many branches of this faith,\n\n* The copy of the Siva P\u00farana which I had the honour to present to the Royal Asiatic Society was obtained for me by the Rana from the temple of Eklinga.\n\n\u2020 Jiva-pitri, the 'father of life,' would be a very proper epithet for Mahad\u00e9va, the 'creative power,' whose Olympus is Kail\u00e1s.\n\n\u2021 B'holanat'hi, or the 'Simple God,' is one of the epithets of Siva, whose want of reflection is so great, that he would give away his own divinity if asked.\n\n\u00a7 V\u00e9dav\u00e1n, the 'Man of Secrets or Knowledge,' is the term used by way of reproach to the Jains, having the import of magician. Their opponents believe them to be possessed of supernatural skill; and it is recorded of the celebrated Umara, author of the Cos'a or dictionary called after him, that he miraculously \"made the full moon appear on Amavus\"\u2014the ides of the month, when the planet is invisible.\n\n|| Khartra signifies 'true,' an epithet of distinction which was bestowed by that great supporter of the Buddhists or Jains, SidraJ, king of Anhulwarra Putun, on one of the branches (gatcha) in a grand religious disputation (badha) at that capital in the eleventh century. The\nLieut.-Colonel Tod on the Religious Establishments of Mewar.\n\nhas 11,000 clerical disciples scattered over India; that a single community, the Ossi or Oswal,* numbers 100,000 families; and that more than half of the mercantile wealth of India passes through the hands of the Jain laity. Rajast'han and Saurashtra are the cradles of the Buddhist or Jain faith, and three out of their five sacred mounts, namely, Abu, Palit'hana,+ and Girnar, are in these countries. The officers of the state and revenue are chiefly of the Jain laity, as are the majority of the bankers from Lahore to the ocean. The Nuggur-S\u00e9th and Chotias, or chief magistrate and assessors of justice, in Udyap\u00far and most of the towns of Rajast'han, are of this sect; and as their voluntary duties are confined to civil cases, they are as competent in these as they are the reverse in criminal cases, from their\n\ncelebrated Hemachandra Acharya was head of the Khartra-gatcha; and his spiritual descendant honoured Udyap\u00far with his presence in his visit to his dioceses in the desert in 1821. My own Yati tutor was a disciple of Hemachandra, and his patravali or pedigree registered his descent by spiritual successions from him.\n\nThis pontiff was a man of extensive learning, and of estimable character. He was versed in all the ancient inscriptions to which no key now exists, and deciphered one for me which had been long unintelligible. His travelling library was of considerable extent, though chiefly composed of works relating to the ceremonies of his religion; it was in the charge of two of his disciples, remarkable for talent, and who, like himself, were perfectly acquainted with all these ancient characters. The pontiff kindly permitted my Yati to bring for my inspection some of the letters of invitation written by his flocks in the desert. These were rolls, some of them several feet in length, containing pictured delineations of their wishes. One from Bikan\u00e9r represented that city, in one division of which was the school or college of the Jains, where the Yatis were all portrayed at their various studies. In another part a procession of them was quitting the southern gate of the city, the head of which was in the act of delivering a scroll to a messenger, while the pontiff was seen with his cort\u00e8ge advancing in the distance. To show the respect in which these high priests of the Jains are held, the princes of Rajputana invariably advance outside the walls of their capital to receive and conduct them to it\u2014a mark of respect paid only to princes. On the occasion of the high priest of the Khartras passing through Udyap\u00far, as above alluded to, the Rana received him with every distinction.\n\n* So called from the town of Ossa, in Marwar.\n\n\u2020 Pali-t'hana or \"the abode of the Pali,\" is the name of the town at the foot of the sacred mount Satrunjya (signifying 'victorious over the foe'), on which the Jain temples are sacred to Buddh-isvara, or the 'Lord of the Buddhists.' I have little doubt that the name of Palit'hana is derived from the pastoral (pali) Scythic invaders bringing the Buddhist faith in their train\u2014a faith which appears to me not indigenous to India. Palestine, which with the whole of Syria and Egypt, was ruled by the Yksos or shepherd-kings, who for a season expelled the old Coptic race, may have had a similar import to the Pali-t'hana founded by the Indo-Scythic Pali. The author visited all these sacred mounts.\ntenets forbidding the shedding of blood. To this leading feature in their religion they owe their political debasement: for Komarpal, the last king of Anhulwara of the Jain faith, would not march his armies in the rains, from the unavoidable sacrifice of animal life which must have ensued. The strict Jain does not even maintain a lamp during that season, lest it should attract moths to their destruction.\n\nThe period of sectarian intolerance is past; and as far as my observation goes, the ministers of Visnu, Siva, and Buddha, view each other without malignity, which feeling never appears to have influenced the laity of either sect, who are indiscriminately respectful to the ministers of all religions, whatever be their tenets. It is sufficient that their office is one of sanctity and that they are ministers of the Divinity, who, they say, excludes the homage of none, in whatever tongue, or whatever manner he is sought; and with this spirit of entire toleration, the devout missionary or Mulla would in no country meet more security or hospitable courtesy than among the Rajputs. They must, however, adopt the toleration they would find practised towards themselves, and not exclude, as some of them do, the races of Surya and Chandra from divine mercy, who, with less arrogance and more reliance on the compassionate nature of the Creator, say he has established a variety of paths by which the good may attain beatitude.\n\nMewar has, from the most remote period, afforded a refuge to the followers of the Jain faith, which was the religion of Balabhi, the first capital of the Rana's ancestors, the Balhara sovereigns of Saurashtra, and many monuments attest the support this family has granted to its professors in all the vicissitudes of their fortunes. One of the best preserved monumental remains in India is a column most elaborately sculptured, full seventy feet in height, dedicated to Parswanat'h, in Chitore. The noblest remains of sacred architecture, not in Mewar only, but throughout Western India, are Buddhist or Jain: and the many ancient cities where this religion was fostered have inscriptions which evince their prosperity in these countries with whose history their own is interwoven. In fine, the necrological records of the Jains bear witness to their having occupied a distinguished place in Rajput society; and the privileges they yet enjoy prove that they are not even now overlooked.\n\nIt is not my intention to say more on the past or present history of these sectarians than may be necessary to shew the footing on which their establishments are placed: to which end little is required beyond copies of a\nfew simple warrants and ordinances in their favour.* On a future occasion, I may endeavour to add something to the stores of knowledge already possessed of these the deists of Rajasthan, whose singular communities contain mines of knowledge hitherto inaccessible to Europeans. The libraries of Jessulmer in the desert, of Anhulwara the cradle of their faith, of Cambay, and other places of minor importance, consist of thousands of volumes. These are under the control, not of the priests alone, but of communities of the most wealthy and respectable amongst the laity, and are preserved in the crypts of their temples, which precaution ensured their existence, as well as that of the statues of their deified teachers, when the temples themselves were destroyed by the Mahommedan invader, who paid more deference to the images of Buddha than to those of Siva or Vishnu. The preservation of the former is in part owing to the natural formation of their statues; and while many of Adnat'h, of Nemi, and of Parswa have escaped the hammer, there is scarcely a Kaniya (Apollo) or a Rembha (Venus) of any antiquity, with a nose, from Lahore to Ram-iswara. The two arms of these theists sufficed for their protection; while the statues of the polytheists, though gifted with as many as Briareus, have met with no mercy.\n\nNo. V.+ is the translation of a grant by the celebrated Rana Raj Sing, the gallant and successful opponent of Arungz\u00e9b in many a battle. It is at once of a general and special nature, containing a confirmation of the old privileges of the sect, and a mark of favour to a priest of some distinction called Manoh. It is well known that the first law of the Jains, like that of the ancient Athenian lawgiver Triptolemus, is \"Thou shalt not kill,\" a precept applicable to every sentient being. The first clause of this edict, in conformity thereto, prohibits all innovation upon this cherished principle; while the second declares that even the life which is forfeited to the laws is immortal (umra) if the victim but passes their abodes. The third article defines the extent of sirna, or sanctuary, the dearest privilege of the races of these regions, whose temples are as sacred to the refugee, as were those of the Levite of Israel, or the shrines of Greece. The fourth article sanctions the tythes, both on agricultural and commercial produce; and makes no distinction between the Jain priests and those of Siva and Vishnu in this source of income, which will be more fully detailed in the account of Nat'h-dwara. The fifth article is the particular gift to the priest; and the whole closes with the usual anathema against such as may infringe the ordinance.\n\n* See Appendix to this paper. \u2020 Ibid.\nThe edicts Nos. VI. and VII,* engraved on pillars of stone in the towns of Rasmi and Bakrole, further illustrate the scrupulous observances of the Rana\u2019s house towards the Jains; where, in compliance with their peculiar doctrine, the oil-mill and the potter\u2019s wheel suspend their revolutions for the four months in the year when insects most abound. Many others of a similar character could be furnished, but these remarks may be concluded with an instance of the influence of the Jains on Rajp\u00fat society which passed immediately under the author\u2019s eye. In the midst of a sacrifice to the god of war, when the victims were rapidly falling by the scymitar, a request preferred by one of them for the life of a goat or a buffalo on the point of immolation, met instant compliance, and the animal now declared amara or immortal, with a garland thrown round his neck, was led off in triumph from the blood-stained spot.\n\nNat\u2019hdwara\u2014This is the most celebrated of the fanes of the Hindu Apollo. Its etymology is \u2018the portal (dvara) of the god\u2019 (Nath), of the same import as his more ancient shrine of Dwarica\u2020 at the world\u2019s end (Juggut Kunt). Nat\u2019hdwara is twenty-two miles N.N.E. of Udyap\u00far, on the right bank of the Bunas. Although the principal resort of the followers of Vishnu, it has nothing very remarkable in its structure or situation. It owes its celebrity entirely to the image of Crishna, which is the same that has been worshipped at Mat\u2019hura since his deification, between eleven and twelve hundred years before Christ.\u00a7 As containing the representative of the mildest of the gods of Hind, Nat\u2019hdwara is one of the most frequented places of pilgrimage, though it must want that attraction to the classical Hindu, which the caves of Gaya, the shores of the distant Dwarica, or the pastoral Vrij,\u00a7 the place of the nativity of Crishna, present\n\n* See Appendix to this article.\n\n\u2020 Dwarica is at the point called Juggut Kunt, of the Saurashtra peninsula. Ca is the mark of the genitive case. Dwar-ca-nat\u2019h would be the \u201cgate of the god.\u201d\n\n\u2021 Fifty-seven descents are given both in their sacred and profane genealogies from Crishna to the princes supposed to have been cotemporary with Vicramaditya. The Yadu B\u2019hatti or Shama B\u2019hatti (the Asham Betti of Abul Fuzil), draw their pedigree from Crishna or Yadunath, as do the Jhar\u00e9jas of Kutch.\n\n\u00a7 With Mat\u2019hura as a centre and a radius of eighty miles, describe a circle: all within it is Vrij, which was the seat of whatever was refined in Hinduism, and whose language, the Vrij-basha, was the purest dialect of India. Vrij is tantamount to the land of the Suraseni, derived from Sur\u2019s\u00e9n, the ancestor of Crishna, whose capital, S\u00farp\u00fari, is about fifty miles south of\nto his imagination; for though the groves of Vindra,* in which Kaniya disported with the Gopis, no longer resound to the echoes of his flute; though the waters of the Yamuna\u2020 are daily polluted with the blood of the sacred kine, still it is the holy land of the pilgrim, the sacred Jordan of his fancy, on whose banks he may sit and weep, as did the banished Israelite of old, the glories of Mat'hura, his Jerusalem!\n\nIt was in the reign of Arungzebe that the pastoral divinity was exiled from Vrij, that classic soil, which, during a period of two thousand eight hundred years had been the sanctuary of his worshippers. He had been compelled to occasional flights during the visitations of Mahmud and the first dynasties of Afghan invaders; though the more tolerant of the Mogul kings not only reinstated him, but were suspected of dividing their faith between Kaniya and the prophet. Akber was an enthusiast in the mystic poetry of Jydeva, which paints in rich and glowing colours the loves of Kaniya and Rad'ha, in which lovely personification the refined Hindu abjures all sensual interpretation, asserting its character of pure spiritual love. It affords an example of the Hindu doctrine of the Metempsychosis, as well as of the regard which Akber's toleration had obtained him, to mention, that they held his body to be animated by the soul of a celebrated Hindu gymnosophist: in support of which, they say, he (Akber) went to his accustomed spot of penance (tapasya) at the confluence of the Yamuna and Ganges, and excavated the implements, viz. the tongs, gourd, and deer-skin, of his anchorite existence. Jehangir, by birth half a Rajput, was equally indulgent to the worship of Kaniya: but Shah Jehan, also the son of a Rajput princess, inclined to the doctrines of Siva, in which he was initiated by Sid-rup Sanyasi. Sectarian animosity is more virulent than faiths totally dissimilar. Here we see Hindu depressing Hindu: the\n\nMat'hura on the Yamuna (Jumna); the remains of this city (S\u00farp\u00fari) the author had the pleasure of discovering. The province of the Surseni, or Suraseni, is defined by Menu, and particularly mentioned by the historians of Alexander.\n\n* Vindra-vana, or the \"forests of Vindra,\" in which were placed many temples sacred to Kaniya, is on the Yamuna, a few miles above Mat'hura. A pilgrimage to this temple is indispensable to the true votary of Crishna.\n\n\u2020 This river is called the Kal Yamuna, or black Yamuna, and Kali-d\u00e9 or the \"black pool,\" from Kaniya having destroyed the hydra Kaliya which infested it. Jydeva calls the Yamuna \"the blue daughter of the sun.\"\nfollowers of Siva oppressing those of Kaniya; the priests of Jupiter driving the pastoral Apollo from the Parnassus (Girdhana) of Vrij. At the intercession, however, of a princess of Udyapur, Apollo was replaced on his altar, where he remained till Arungzebe became emperor of the Moguls. In such detestation did the Hindus hold this intolerant king, that in like manner as they supposed the beneficent Akber to be Mokund Brimachari, the most devout of men, in a former birth, so they invest the tyrant's body with the soul of Kal Yamun, the foe of Crishna, ere his apotheosis, and to avoid whom he fled from the sacred territory to Dwarica, and thence acquired the name of Rinchor.*\n\nWhen Arungzebe proscribed Kaniya, and rendered his shrines impure throughout Vrij, Rana Raj Sing of Udyapur \"offered the heads of one hundred thousand of his Rajputs for his service,\" and the god was conducted by the route of Kotah and Rampura to Mevar. An omen decided the spot of the future residence of Kaniya, for as he journeyed to gain the capital of the Sisodias, the chariot-wheel sunk deep into the earth and defied extrication. The Sukuni (augur) interpreted the pleasure of the god, that he desired to dwell there. This circumstance occurred at an inconsiderable village called Siarh, in the fief of Dailwara, one of the sixteen nobles of Mevar.\n\nRejoiced at this decided manifestation of favour, the chief hastened to make a perpetual gift of the village and its lands, which was speedily confirmed by the patent of the Rana.\u2020 Nat'lyji (the god) was removed from his car, and in time a temple was erected for his reception, when the hamlet of Siarh became the town of Nat'hdwara, which now contains many thousand inhabitants, of all denominations, who, reposing under the especial protection of the god, are exempt from every mortal tribunal. Its site is not uninteresting, nor is it devoid of the means of defence. To the east it is shut in by a cluster of hills, and to the westward flows the Bunas, which nearly bathes the extreme points of the hills. Within these bounds is the sanctuary (sirna) of Kaniya, where the criminal is free from pursuit; nor\n\n* Rin, the \"field of battle,\" Chor, from chorna, to abandon. Hence Rinchor, one of the titles under which Crishna is worshipped at Dwarica, is most unpropitious to the martial Rajput. Kal-Yamun, the foe from whom he fled, and who is figured as a serpent, is doubtless the Tak, the ancient foe of the Yadiis, who slew Janmaja, emperor of the Pandus.\n\n\u2020 See Appendix to this paper, No. VIII.\ndare the rod of justice appear on the Mount, or the foot of the pursuer pass the stream; neither within it can blood be spilt, for the pastoral K\u0101niya delights not in offerings of this kind. The territory contains within its precincts abundant space for the town, the temple, and the establishments of the priests, as well as the numerous resident worshippers, and the constant influx of votaries from the most distant regions,\n\n\"From Samarcand by Oxus, Temir's throne,\nDown to the golden Chersonese;\"\n\nwho find abundant shelter from the noontide blaze in the groves of tamarind, pipul, and semul, where they listen to the divine melodies of Govinda or the mystic hymns of Jydeva. Here those whom ambition has cloyed, superstition unsettled, satiety disgusted, commerce ruined, or crime disquieted, may be found as ascetic attendants on the mildest of the gods of India. Renouncing the world, they first renounce the ties that bind them to it, whether family, friends, or fortune, and placing their wealth at the disposal of K\u0101niya, stipulate only for a portion of the food dressed for him, and to be permitted to prostrate themselves before him till their allotted time is expired. Here no blood-stained sacrifice scares the timid devotee; no austerities terrify, or tedious ceremonies fatigue him; he is taught to cherish the hope that he has only to ask for mercy, to obtain it; and to believe that the compassionate deity who guarded the lapwing's nest* in the\n\n---\n\n* Whoever has unhooded the falcon at a lapwing, or even scared one from her nest, need not be told of its peculiarly distressing scream, as if appealing to sympathy. The allusion here is to the lapwing scared from her nest, as the rival armies of the C\u016bris and Pandus joined in battle, when the compassionate Crishna, taking from an elephant's neck a war-bell (vira-guntha), covered the nest, in order to protect it.\n\nWhen the majority of the feudal nobles of Marwar became self-exiled, to avoid the almost demoniac fury of their sovereign, since his alliance with the British government, Anar Sing, the chief of Ahore, a fine specimen of the Rahtore Rajput, brave, intelligent, and amiable, was one day lamenting that while all India was enjoying tranquillity under the shield of Britain, they alone were suffering from the caprice of a tyrant; concluding a powerful appeal to my personal interposition with the foregoing allegory, and observing on the beauty of the office of mediator. \"You are all powerful,\" added he, \"and we may be of little account in the grand scale of affairs; but Crishna condescended to protect even the lapwing's egg in the midst of battle.\" This brave man knew my anxiety to make their peace with their sovereign, and being acquainted with the allegory, I replied with some fervour, in the same strain, \"Would to God, Thakoor Sahib, I had the vira-guntha to protect you.\" The effect was instantaneous, and the eye\nmidst of myriads of combatants; who gave beatitude to the courtezan* who, as the wall crushed her, pronounced the name of \"Rama,\" will not withhold it from him who has quitted the world and its allurements that he may live in his presence, be fed by the food prepared for himself, and yield up his last sigh invoking the name of Heri. There are not less than two hundred individuals at this time, most of whom, stipulating merely for food, raiment, and funeral rites, have abandoned all to pass their days in devotion at the shrine of Kaniya: men of every condition, Rajput, merchant, and mechanic; and where sincerity of devotion is the sole expiation, and gifts outweigh penance, they must feel the road to futurity as smooth as any which leads to the haven of hope.\n\nThe dead stock of Crishna's shrine is augmented chiefly by \"those who hold life unstable as the dew-drop on the lotus;\" \"brittle as a blade of grass;\" and riches \"as a vain shadow;\" and who are happy to barter \"the wealth of Ormuz and of Ind\" for the intercessional prayers of the high-priest, and his passport to Heri-pur, the heaven of Heri. From the banks of the Indus to the mouths of the Ganges, from the coasts of the Peninsula to the shores of the Red Sea, the gifts of gratitude or of fear are lavishly poured in; and though the unsettled aspect of the last half century curtailed the transmission of the more bulky, but least valuable benefactions, it little affected the bills of exchange from the successful sons of commerce, or the legacies of the dead. The safe arrival of a galleon from Sofala or Arabia produced at least as much to the shrine as to the insurance-office, for Kaniya is the Saint Nicholas of the Hindu navigator, as was Apollo to the Grecian and Celtic sailors, who purchased his charmed arrows from the priestess to calm the troubled sea.\u2020 A storm accordingly\n\nof this manly chieftain, who had often fearlessly encountered the foe in battle, filled with tears as, holding out his hand, he said, \"At least you listen to our griefs, and speak the language of friendship. Say but the word, and you may command the services of twenty thousand Rahtores.\" There is, indeed, no human being more susceptible of excitement, and, under it, of being led to any desperate purpose, whether for good or for evil, than the Rajput.\n\n* Chund, the bard, gives this instance of the compassionate nature of Crishna, taken, as well as the former, from the Mahabharat.\n\n\u2020 Near the town of Avranches, on the coast of Normandy, is a rock called Mont St. Michel, in ancient times sacred to the Gallic or Celtic Apollo, who was called Belenus; a name which the author from whom we quote observes, \"certainly came from the East, and proves that the littoral provinces of Gaul were visited by the Phoenicians.\" \"A college of Druidical priestesses\nyields in proportion to its violence, or to the nerve of the owner of the vessel. The appearance of a long-denied heir may deprive him of half his patrimony, and force him to lament his parents' distrust in natural causes; while the accidental mistake of touching forbidden foods on particular fasts requires expiation, not by flagellation or seclusion, but by the penance of the purse.\n\nThere is no donation too great or too trifling for the acceptance of CRISHNA, from the baronial estate to a patch of meadow-land; from the gemmed coronet to adorn the image of the god to the widow's mite; nor is there a principality in India which does not diminish its fisc to add to the revenues of NAT'HIDWARA. What effect the milder rites of the shepherd-god have produced on the martial adorers of Siva we know not, but assuredly EKLINGA, the tutelary divinity of M\u00e9war, has to complain of being defrauded of half his dues since KANIYA transferred his abode from the Yamuna to the Bunas. By a strange inconsistency, the revenues assigned by the RANA to KANIYA, who under the epithet of Pit\u00e1mbra (or god of the yellow mantle) has a distinguished niche in his domestic chapel, far exceed those of the Avenger (EKLINGA), whose vicegerent he is. The grants or patents from the RANA, the head of all the martial races,* defining the privileges and immunities of the shrine, are curious documents.\u2020\n\nThe extension of the sanctuary by the RANA beyond the vicinage of the shrine became a subject of much animadversion; and in delegating judicial\n\n---\n\n* Hindup\u00e1ti, vulg\u00f2 Hinduput, \"chief of the Hindu race,\" is a title justly appertaining to the RANAS of M\u00e9war. It has, however, been assumed by chieftains scarcely superior to some of his vassals, though with some degree of pretension by SEVAJ\u00cd, who, had he been spared, might have worked out the redemption of his nation, and of the RANA's house, from which he sprung.\n\n\u2020 See Appendix to this paper, Nos. ix and x.\nauthority over the whole of the villages in the grant, to the priests, he committed the temporal welfare of his subjects to a class of men not apt to be lenient in the collection of their dues, which not unfrequently led to bloodshed. In alienating the other royalties, especially the transit duties, he was censured even by the zealots of Crishna. Yet, however important such concessions, they were of subordinate value to the rights of sanctuary, which were extended to the whole of the towns in the grant, thereby multiplying the places of refuge for crime, already too numerous.\n\nIn all ages and countries the rights of sanctuary have been admitted, and however they may be abused, their institution sprung from humane motives. To check the impulse of revenge and to shelter the weak from oppression are noble objects, and the surest test of the independence of a state is the extent to which they are carried. From the remotest times sirna has been the most valued privilege of the Rajputs, the lowest of whom deems his house a refuge against the most powerful. But we merely propose here to discuss the sanctuary of holy places, and more immediately that of the shrine of Kanixa.\n\nWhen Moses, after the Exodus, made a division of the lands of Canaan amongst the Israelites, and appointed \"six cities to be the refuge of him who had slain unwittingly, from the avenger of blood,\"* the intent of this appointment was not to afford facilities for eluding justice, but to check the impulse of sudden revenge; for the slayer was only to be protected \"until he stood before the congregation for judgment, or until the death of the high-priest,\" which event appears to have been considered as the termination of revenge: \"then did the slayer return to the city from whence he fled.\"\u2020 The infraction of political sanctuary (sirna turma) often gives rise to the most inveterate feuds; and its abuse by the priests, both of Eklinga\n\n---\n\n* Numbers, chap. xxxv. v. 11, 12.\n\n\u2020 Numbers, chap. xxxv. v. 25, and Joshua, chap. xx. v. 6. There was an ancient law of Athens analogous to the Mosaic, by which he who committed \"chance-medley,\" should fly the country for a year, during which his relatives made satisfaction to the relatives of the deceased. The Greeks had asyla for every description of criminals, which could not be violated without infamy. Gibbon gives a memorable instance of disregard of the sanctuary of St. Julian in Auvergne, by the soldiers of the Frank king Theodoric, who divided the spoils of the altar, and made the priests captives: an impiety not only unsanctioned by the son of Clovis, but punished by the death of the offenders, the restoration of the plunder, and the extension of the right of sanctuary five miles around the sepulchre of the holy martyr.\nand Kaniya, is highly prejudicial to society. Moses appointed but six cities of refuge to the whole Levite tribe; but the Rana has assigned more to the shrine of Krishna alone than the entire possessions of that branch of the Israelites, who had but forty-two cities, while Kaniya has forty-six. The motive of such sanctuary in Rajasthan was originally the same as that of the divine legislator; but it has been corrupted and abused, and the most notorious criminals deem the temple their best safeguard. Yet some princes have been found hardy enough to violate, though indirectly, the sacred sirna.\n\nZalim Sing of Kotah, a zealot in all the observances of religion, had the boldness to draw the line when selfish priestcraft interfered with his police; and though he would not demand the culprit, or sacrilegiously drag him from the altar, he has forced him thence by prohibiting the admission of food, and threatening to build up the door of the temple. It was thus the Greeks evaded the laws, and compelled the criminal's surrender by kindling fires around the sanctuary. The towns of Kaniya did not often abuse their privilege; but the author once had to interpose, where a priest of Eklinga had harboured a murderer when on the point of being secured. The priest so far respected the wishes of the Rana as to induce the man to quit the asylum: but as the example was pernicious, and Pahona, the town within whose bounds the murder had been committed, had been gained by a forged grant, the author wilfully incurred the award for resuming church land (a sixty-thousand years' residence in hell) and recommended that Pahona (of eight thousand rupees annual revenue) should be reunited to the fisc. The unusual occurrence created a sensation, but it was so indisputably just that not a voice was raised in opposition.\n\nLet us now revert to the endowments of Nat'hdwara. Herodotus furnishes a powerful instance of the estimation is which sacred offerings were held by the nations of antiquity. He observes that these were transmitted from the remotest nations of Scythia to Delos* in Greece; a range far less extensive than the offerings to the temple (d\u00e9wal) of Krishna in Mewar. The spices of the isles of the Indian archipelago; the balmy spoils of Araby the blest; the nard, or frankincense of Tartary; the raisins and pistachios of Persia;\n\n---\n\n* Apollo was the object adored in Delos, as at Nat'hdwara. Numerous Greek proper names can have Sanscrit derivations; and for Delos we have Dewal-es, i.e. \"temple of the God.\" Such is the origin of Debeil (corrupted from Dewal, the temple), the capital of Lower Sindc. The numerous Dewarars (sometimes written Dail) have the same etymology. Dewalwara, i.e. \"the place of the temple.\"\nevery variety of saccharine preparation, from the *sacar-cand* (sugar-candy) of the celestial empire, with which Kaniya sweetens his evening repast, to that more common sort which enters into the *p\u00e9ras* of Mat'hura, the food of his infancy; the shawls of Cashm\u00e9r, the silks of Bengal, the scarfs of Benares, the brocades of Guzerat,\n\n\"the flower and choice\n\"Of many provinces from bound to bound,\"\n\nwith whatever is rare in art or nature, all contribute to enrich the shrine of Nat'hdwara. But it is with the votaries of the maritime provinces of India that he has most reason to be satisfied; in the commercial cities of Surat, Cambay, Muscat-mandavi, &c. &c., where the M\u00fakhias, or comptrollers deputed by the high-priest, reside to collect the benefactions, and transmit them as occasion requires. A deputy resides on the part of the high-priest at M\u00faltan, who invests the distant worshippers of Kaniya with the *zunu* and *canti* (the cordon and necklace). Even from Samarcand the pilgrims repair with their offerings to Nat'hdwara; and a sum, seldom less than ten thousand rupees, is annually transmitted by the votaries from the Arabian ports of Muscat, Mocha, and Jidda; which contribution is very probably augmented, not only by the votaries who dwell at the mouths of the Wolga,* but by the\n\n---\n\n* Pallas gives an admirable and evidently faithful account of the worship of Crishna and other Hindu divinities in the city of Astracan, where a Hindu mercantile colony is established. They are termed M\u00faltani, from the place whence they migrated\u2014M\u00faltan, near the Indus. This class of merchants of the Hindu faith is disseminated over all the countries, from the Indus to the Caspian: and it would have been interesting had the professor given us any account of their period of settlement on the western shore of the Caspian sea. In costume and feature, as represented in the plate given by that author, they have nothing to denote their origin; though their divinities might be seated on any altar on the Ganges. The M\u00faltanis of the \"Indesko\u00ef Dvor, or Indian Court,\" at Astracan, have erected a pantheon, in which Crishna, the god of all Vishnu\u00e9 merchants, is seated, *primus inter pares*, in front of Juggernat'h, Rama, and his brothers, who stand in the back-ground; while Siva and his consort Asita-bhu'ja (the eight-armed), form an intermediate line, in which is also placed a statue which Pallas denominates M\u00fali; but Pallas mistook the flute (*m\u00farali*) of the divine Crishna for a rod. The principal figure we shall describe in his own words. \"In the middle was placed a small idol with a very high bonnet, called Gupaledshi, \"At its right there was a large black stone, and on the left two smaller ones of the same colour, \"brought from the Ganges, and regarded by the Hindus as sacred. These fossils were of the \"species called Sankara, and appeared to be an impression of a bivalve muscle.\" Minute as is the description, our judgment is further aided by the plate. Gupaledshi is evidently Gopalji, the pastoral deity of Vrij (from gao, a cow, and pali, a herdsman). The head-dress worn by him and all the others, is precisely that still worn by Crishna, in the sacred dance at Muttra: and so minute is the delineation, that even the *p\u00e9ra* or sugar-ball is represented, although the\nSamoyede* of Siberia. There is not a petty retailer, professing the Vishnu creed, who does not carry a tythe of his trade to the stores (Sangiri) of Kaniya: and thus caravans of thirty and forty cars, double-yoked, pass twice or thrice annually by the upper road to Nat\u2019hdwara. These pious\n\nProfessor appears to have been ignorant of its use, as he does not name it. He has likewise omitted to notice the representation of the sacred mount of Gird\u2019hana, which separates him from the Hindu Jove and the turreted Cybele (Durga), his consort. The black stones are the Saligramas, worshipped by all Vishnu\u00ebs.\n\nIn the names of \u201cN\u2019handigana and Gori,\u201d though the first is called a lion saddled, and the other a male divinity, we easily recognize Nanda, the bull-attendant (Gana) of Siva, and his consort Gouri. Were all travellers to describe what they see with the same accuracy as Pallas, they would confer important obligations on society, and might defy criticism.\n\nIt is with heartfelt satisfaction I have to record, from the authority of a gentleman who has dwelt amongst the Hindikis of Astracan, that distance from their ancient abodes has not deteriorated their character for uprightness. Mr. Mitchell, from whose knowledge of Oriental languages the Royal Asiatic Society will some day derive benefit, says, that the reputation of these Hindu colonists, of whom there are about five hundred families, stands very high; and that they bear a preference over all the merchants of other nations settled in this great commercial city.\n\n* Other travellers besides Pallas have described Hinduism as existing in the remote parts of the Russian empire, and if nominal resemblances may be admitted, we would instance the strong analogy between the Samoyedes and Tchoudes of Siberia and Finland, and the Sama-Yadus and Joudes of India. The languages of the two former races are said to have a strong affinity, and are classed as Hindu-Germanic by M. Klaproth, on whose learned work, \u201cAsia Polyglotta,\u201d M. R\u00e9musat has given the world an interesting critique, in his M\u00e9langes Asiatiques (tom. i. p. 267), in which he traces these tribes to Central Asia; thus approaching the land of the Gele or Yuti. Now the Yatis and Yadus have much in their early history to warrant the assertion of more than nominal resemblance. The annals of the Yadus of Jessulm\u00e9r state, that long anterior to Vicrama, they held dominion from Guzni to Samarcand: that they established themselves in those regions after the Mahabharat, or great war; and were again impelled, on the rise of Islamism, within the Indus. As Yadus of the race of Sh\u00e1m or Sam (a title of Krishna) they would be Sama-Yadus; in like manner as the B\u2019hatti tribe are called Shama-B\u2019hatti, the Ashamb\u00e9tti of Abulfuzil. The race of Joude was existing near the Indus in the Emperor Baber\u2019s time, who describes them as occupying the mountainous range in the first Do-\u00e1b, the very spot mentioned in the annals of the Yadus as their place of halt, on quitting India, twelve centuries before Christ, and thence called Jadu or Yadu-ca-dang, the \u201chills of Jadu or Yadu.\u201d The peopling of all these regions, from the Indus to remote Tartary, is attributed to the race of Ayu or Indu, both signifying the moon, of which are the Hyas, Aswas (Asi), Yadus, &c., who spread a common language over all Western Asia. Amongst the few words of Hindu-Germanic origin which M. R\u00e9musat gives to prove affinity between the Finnish and Samoyede languages is \u201cMiel, Mod, dans le dialecte Caucasiens, et M\u00e9d, en Slave,\u201d and which, as well as mead, the drink of the Scandinavian warrior, is from the Sanscrit Madhu, a bee. Hence intoxicating beverage is termed Madhva, which supplies another epithet for Krishna, Madh\u00fa or Madhava.\nbounties are not allowed to moulder in the bindars (repositories) of Kaniya; the apparel is distributed with a liberal hand as the gift of the deity to those who evince their devotion; and the edibles enter daily into the various food prepared at the shrine. It has been remarked by the celebrated Goguet* that the custom of offering food to the object of divine homage had its origin in a principle of gratitude, the repast being deemed hallowed by presenting the first portion to him who gave it, since the devotee was unable to conceive aught more acceptable than that whereby life is sustained. From the earliest period such offerings have been tendered; and in the burnt-offering (hom) of Abel, of the firstling of the flock, and the first portion of the repast presented by the Rajput to And\u00e9vat\u2020 (the nourisher), the motive is the same. But the purs\u00e1d\u2014such is the denomination of the food prepared for Kaniya\u2014is deemed unlucky, if not unholy:\u2014a prejudice arising from the heterogeneous sources whence it is supplied\u2014often from bequests of the dead. The M\u00fakhias of the temple accordingly carry the sacred food to wheresoever the votaries of Kaniya dwell, which proves an irresistible stimulus to backward zeal, and produces an ample return. At the same time are transmitted, as from the god, dresses of honour corresponding in material and value with the rank of the receiver: a diadem, or fillet of satin and gold, embroidered; a dugla or quilted coat of gold or silver brocade for the cold weather; a scarf of blue and gold; or if to one who prizes the gift less for its intrinsic worth than as a mark of special favour, a fragment of the garland worn on some festival by the god; or a simple necklace (canti), the emblem of every follower of Vishnu, and by which he is inaugurated amongst the elect.\u2021\n\nIt has been mentioned that the lands of M\u00e9war appropriated to the shrine of Kaniya are equal in value to a baronial appanage, and, as before observed, there is not a principality in India which does not assign a portion of its domain or revenue to this object. The Hara princes of Kotah and Bandi are almost exclusive worshippers of Kaniya, and the regent Zalim Sing is devoted to the maintenance of the dignity of the establishment. Everything at Kotah appertains to Kaniya. The prince has but the usufruct of the palace, for which \u00a312,000 is annually transmitted to the shrine.\n\n* Origin of Laws and Government. \u2020 Literally \"the giver of food.\" \u2021 'Kaniya ca canti band'hna,' 'to bind on [the neck] the chaplet of Kaniya,' is the initiator step.\ngrand lake east of the town, with all its finny tenants, is under his especial protection;* and the extensive suburb adjoining, with its rents, lands, and transit duties, all belong to the god. ZALIM SING moreover transmits to the high priest the most valuable shawls, broadcloths, and horses; and throughout the long period of predatory warfare he maintained two N\u00e9shans\u2020 of a hundred firelocks each, for the protection of the temple. His favourite son also, a child of love, is called GORDHUN-DAS, the 'slave of Gordhun,' one of the many titles of KANIYA. The prince of Marwar went mad from the murder of the high priest of JALINDRA, the epithet given to KANIYA in that state: and the Raja of Sheopur,\u2021 the last of the Gor\u00e9s, lost his sovereignty by abandoning the worship of Hur, for HERI. The 'slave' of RADHA (Radha-ca-das),\u00a7 such was the name of this prince, almost lived in the temple, and used to dance before the statue of KANIYA. Had he upheld the rights of him who wields the trident (tri-d\u00e9nta or tri-s\u00fala), the tutelary deity of his capital, Siva-p\u00far, instead of the unwarlike divinity whose unpropitious title of RINCHOR\u00b6 should never be borne by the martial Rajp\u00fat, his fall would have been more dignified, though it could not have been retarded when the overwhelming torrent of the Mahrattas under SINDIA swept Rajwarra.\u00b6\n\nA distinction is made between the grants to the temple and those for the personal use of the pontiff, who affects at least never to apply any portion of the former to his own use, and he can scarcely have occasion to do so; but when from the stores of Apollo could be purchased the spices of the isles, the fruits of Persia, and the brocades of Guzerat, we may indulge\n\n---\n\n* I had one day thrown my net into this lake, which abounded with a variety of fish, when my pastime was interrupted by a message from the regent, ZALIM SING: \"Tell Captain Tod that Kotah and all around it are at his disposal; but these fish belong to KANIYA.\" I of course immediately desisted, and the fish were returned to the safeguard of the deity.\n\n\u2020 A N\u00e9shan, or standard, is synonymous with a company.\n\n\u2021 Sheopur or Siva-p\u00far, the city of SHEO or SIVA, the god of war, whose battle-shout is Hur; and hence one of his epithets, as HERI is that of CRISHNA or KANIYA.\n\n\u00a7 RADHA was the name of the chief of the Gopis or nymphs of Vrij and the beloved of KANIYA.\n\n\u00b6 See note, p. 288.\n\n\u00b6 In October 1807 I rambled through all these countries, then scarcely known by name to us. At that time Sheopur was independent, and its prince treated me with the greatest hospitality. In 1809 I witnessed its fall, when following with the embassy in the train of the Mahratta leader.\nour scepticism and heresy in questioning the reality of such forbearance. This abuse has, however, been modified, and traffic is chased from the temple. The personal grant (Appendix No. XI.) of the Rana to the high priest in the old days of M\u00e9war, ought alone to have sufficed for his household expenditure, being \u00a32,500 per annum, equal to \u00a310,000 in Europe. But the ten thousand towns of M\u00e9war (dos s\u00e9h\u00e9s M\u00e9war), from each of which he levied a crown, now exist only in the old rent-roll, and the heralds of Apollo would in vain attempt to collect their tribute from five thousand villages in the present day.\n\nThe Appendix No. XII. being a grant of privileges to a minor shrine of Kaniya, in his character of m\u00fbrali-d'h\u00e2r or 'flute-player,' contains much information on the minutiae of benefactions, and will afford a good idea of the nature of the revenues of the Hindu Apollo.\n\nThe predominance of the mild doctrines of Kaniya over the dark rites of Siva, is doubtless beneficial to Rajp\u00fat society. Were the prevention of female immolation the sole good resulting from their prevalence, that alone would conciliate our partiality: a real worshipper of Vishnu forbids his wife from following him to the pyre, as did recently the B\u00e2ndi prince. In fact, their tenderness to animal life is carried to nearly as great an excess as with the Jains, who shed no blood. Celibacy is not imposed upon the priests of Kaniya, as upon those of Siva: on the contrary, they are enjoined to marry, and the priestly office is hereditary by descent. Their wives do not burn, but are committed, like themselves, to the earth. They inculcate tenderness towards all beings; though whether this feeling influences the mass, must depend on the soil which receives the seed, for the outward ceremonies of religion cost far less effort than the practice or essentials. I have often smiled at the incessant aspirations of the Macchiavelli of Rajast'han, Zalim Sing, who, while he ejaculated the name of 'Pribhu' as he told his beads, was inwardly absorbed by mundane affairs; and when one word would have prevented a civil war, and saved his reputation from the stain of disloyalty to his prince, he was, to use his own words, \"at four-score years and upwards, laying the foundation for another century of life.\" And thus it is with the prince of Marwar, who esteems the life of a man or a goat of equal value when prompted by revenge to take it. Hope may silence the reproaches of conscience, and gifts and ceremonies may be supposed to atone for a deviation from the first principle of their religion\u2014a benevolence which should comprehend every animated thing. But for-\ntunately the princely worshippers of Kaniya are few in number. It is to\nthe sons of commerce we must look for the effects of these doctrines, and\nit is my pride and duty to declare that I have known men of both sects,\nVishnu and Jain, whose integrity was spotless and whose philanthropy was\nunbounded.\n\nPreviously to describing the chief festivals held at Nat'hdwara, and the\nvarious forms (rupa) under which Nat'liji or the God is worshipped, it\nmay be well to sketch the origin of this important member of the Oriental\nPantheon, the 'Preserver,' of the Hindu Triad.\n\nCrishna, Heri, Vishnu, or more familiarly, Kaniya, was of the celebrated\ntribe of Yadu, or Jadi. According to Hindu genealogies, Yadu, the\nfounder of the \"fifty-six tribes,\"* who obtained the sovereignty of India, was\ndescended from Yayat, the third son of a primeval man called Swayambhuma Manu,\u2020 or \"Manu, lord of the earth,\" whose daughter Ella\u00a7\n(Terra) was espoused by Buddha (Mercury), son of Chandrall (the moon),\nwhence the Yadus are styled Chandravansi, or 'children of the moon.'\nBuddha was therefore worshipped as the great ancestor (Pitrisvara, or\n'father-god') of the lunar race; and previous to the apotheosis of Crishna\nwas the common object of devotion with all the Yadu tribe. The prin-\ncipal shrine of Buddha was at Dwarica, where he yet receives adoration as\nBuddha Trivichama.\u00b6 Crishna or Kaniya lived towards the conclusion of\nthe Dwapur, or brazen age, the period of which is calculated to have been\nabout 1100 to 1200 years before Christ.**\n\nHe was born to the inheritance\n\n---\n\n* Chappun cula Yadu.\n\u2020 Qu. Japhet?\n\u2021 Also called Vaiva-swata Manu\u2014\"the man, son of the sun.\"\n\u00a7 Ella, the earth\u2014the Saxon Ertha. The Germans chiefly worshipped Tuisco or Teutates\n(Mercury) and Ertha, who are the Buddha and Ella of the Rajputs.\n|| A male divinity with the Rajputs, the Tatars, and ancient Germans.\n\u00b6 'Triple energy;'\u2014the Hermes Triplex of the Egyptians.\n\n** I shall here subjoin an extract of the rise and progress of Vishnuism, as written at my desire\nby the Mukhiya of the temple:\n\n\"Twenty-five years of the Dwapur (the brazen age) were yet unexpired, when the incarna-\ntion (avatar) of Sri Crishna took place. Of these eleven were passed at Gokul (a), and\nfourteen at Mat'hura. There he used to manifest himself personally, especially at Goverd'hun.\nBut when the Kaliyug (the iron age) commenced he retired to Dwarica, an island separated by\nthe\n\n(a) A small town and island in the Jumna, below Mat'hura. Hence one of Crishna's titles is\nGokul-nat'hi, \"lord of Gokul.\"\nof the land of Vrij, the country of the S\u00faras\u00e9ni, comprehending the territory round Mat'hura for a space of eighty miles, of which he was unjustly deprived in his infancy by his relative Kansa. From its vicinity to Delhi we may infer, either that there was no lord paramount amongst the Yad\u00fas of this period, or that Crishna's family held as vassals of Hastinap\u00fara, then with Indraprest'ha, or Delhi, the chief seat of Yad\u00fa power. There were two princes named S\u00faras\u00e9n amongst the immediate predecessors of Crishna: one, his grandfather, the other eight generations anterior. Which of these was the founder of S\u00farap\u00far on the Yamuna, the capital of the Yad\u00fas of Vrij, we know not, but we may fairly assume that the first gave his name to the region around Mat'hura, described by Arrian as the country of the S\u00faras\u00e9ni. Alexander was in India probably about eight centuries after the deification of Crishna, and it is satisfactory to find that the inquiries he instituted into the genealogy of the dynasty then ruling on the Yamuna correspond very closely with those of the Yad\u00fas of this distant period, and combined with what Arrian says of the origin of the Pand\u00fas, it appears indisputable that the descendants of this powerful branch of the Yad\u00fas ruled on the Yamuna, when the Macedonian erected the altars of Greece on the Indus. Arrian enumerates the names of Bud\u00e6us (\u0392\u03bf\u03b4\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2) and Crad\u00e9vas\n\nthe ocean from Bharatkhund (b), where he passed a hundred years before he went to heaven. In Samvat 937 (A.D. 881) God decreed that the Hindu faith should be overturned, and that the T\u00fa-rishka (c) should rule. Then the j\u00e9z\u00e9ya, or capitation-tax, was inflicted on the head of the Hindu. Their faith also suffered much from the Jains and the various infidel (as\u00fara) sects which abounded. The Jains were so hostile that Brimha manifested himself in the shape of Sancara Acharya, who destroyed them and their religion at Benares. In G\u00fazerat, by their magic, they made the moon appear at Amavus (d). Sancara foretold to its prince, Sid Raj (e), the flood then approaching, who escaped in a boat and fled to Thoda, on which occasion all the Vedyas (f) (magicians) in that country perished.\"\n\n(b) The channel which separates the island of Dwarica from the main land is filled up, except in spring-tides.

Had the historian afforded as many hints for discussing the analogy between the Hindu and Grecian Apollos as he has for the Hercules of Thebes and India, we might have come to a conclusion that the three chief divinities* of Egypt, Greece, and India, had their altars first erected on the Indus, Ganges, and Jumna.\n\nThe earliest objects of adoration in these regions were the sun and moon, whose names designated the two grand races of antiquity, Surya, and Chandra or Indu. Buddha (Mercury), son of Indu, married Ella (Terra), a grand-child of Surya, from which union sprung the Indu race. They deified their ancestor Buddha, who continued to be the chief object of adoration until Crishna: hence it appears that the worship of Bal-Nat'ht and Buddha\u2020 were almost coeval. That the Nomadic tribes of Arabia, as well as those of Tartary and India, adored the same objects, we learn from the earliest writers; and Job, the probable contemporary of Hasti, the founder of the first capital of the Yad\u00fas on the Ganges, boasts in the midst of his griefs that he had always remained uncorrupted by the Sabe\u00efsm which surrounded him. \"If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness, and my mouth has kissed my hand, this also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge, for I should have denied the God that is above.\"\u00a7 That there were many Hindus who, professing a pure monotheism like Job, never kissed the hand either to the Sun (Surya), or his herald, Mercury (Buddha), we may easily credit from the sublimity of the notions of the 'One God,' expressed both by the ancients and moderns, by poets and by princes, of both races;|| but more especially by the sons of Buddha, who for ages bowed not before graven images, and deemed it\n\n---\n\n* Hercules, Mercury, and Apollo; Bala-ram, Buddha, and Kaniya.\n\n\u2020 The 'God Bal,' the Vivifier, the Sun.\n\n\u2021 Buddha signifies 'wisdom.'\n\n\u00a7 Job, ch. xxxi, v. 26, 27, 28.\n\n|| Chand, the bard, says, after having separately invoked the three persons of the Hindu triad, that he who believes them distinct, \"hell will be his portion.\"\nimpious to raise a temple to\n\n\"The Spirit in whose honour shrines are weak.\"\n\nHence the Jains, a grand sect of the Buddhists, so called from adoring the spirit (Jin), were untinctured with idolatry until the apotheosis of Crishna, whose worship and mysteries superseded Buddhism and the simple worship of Nemanat'h.* It was probably long anterior to this schism amongst the sons of Buddha that the creative power was typified, and his worship degraded under sensual forms, when the pillar rose to Bal or Surya (the Vivifier), in Syria and on the Ganges: and the serpent, \"subtlest beast of all the field,\" as the emblem of wisdom (Buddha), was frequently conjoined with the symbol of the creative power, as at the shrine of Eklinga, where the brazen serpent is wreathed round the lingam.\u2020 From the rape of Ella (daughter of Manu, the man, son of the Sun), by Buddha, his descendants the Indus preserved the Ophite rites\u2021 as the sign of their race until Crishna, whose followers adopted the eagle (garuda) as his symbol. Hence the wars of the Pandus and Takshacs of their ancient epics, typified under the eagles and serpents, the professors of the old and new religion.\u00a7 These, with the adorers of Surya (the\n\n* Of the twenty-four incarnations of Buddha, or divine wisdom, Nema-nat'h, the twenty-second, was of the same stock (Yadu) and family as Crishna.\n\n\u2020 It was the serpent (Buddha) who ravished Ella, daughter of Icshwaca, the son of Manu, whence the distinctive epithet of his descendants in the East, Manus, or men. An ancient sculptured column in the south of India, evidently points to the primeval mystery. In Portici there is an exact lingam entwined with a brazen serpent, brought from the temple of Isis at Pompeii; and many of the same kind, in mosaic, decorate the floors of the dwelling-houses. But the most singular coincidence is in the wreath of Lingams and the Yoni over the door of the minor temple of Isis at Pompeii; and on another front is painted the rape of Venus by Mercury (Buddha and Ella). The lunar race, according to the Purans, are the issue of the rape of Ella by Buddha.\n\n\u2021 Aphah is a serpent in Hebrew. Ah\u00e9 and Serp are two of its many appellations in Sanscrit.\n\n\u00a7 The Mahabharat records constant wars from ancient times amongst the children of Surya (the sun) and the Tak or Takshac (serpent) races. The horse of the sun, liberated preparatory to sacrifice, by the father of Rama, was seized by the Takshac Anunta; and Janm\u00e9ja, king of Dehli, grandson of Pandu, was killed by one of the same race. In both instances, the Takshac is literally rendered the snake.\n\nThe successor of Janm\u00e9ja carried war into the seats of this Tak, or serpent race, and is said to have sacrificed 20,000 of them in revenge; but although it is specifically stated that he subsequently compelled them to sign tributary engagements (pa\u00e9nameh), the Brahmans have nevertheless distorted a plain historical fact by a literal and puerile interpretation.\nsun) form the three idolatrous classes of India, not confined to its modern restricted definition, but that of antiquity, when Indu-sthan, or Indu-Scythia, extended from the Ganges to the Caspian. In support of the position that the existing polytheism was unknown on the rise of Vishnuism, we may state, that in none of the ancient genealogies do the names of such deities appear as proper names in society, a practice now common; and it is even recorded that the rites of magic, the worship of the host of heaven, and of idols, were introduced from Cashm\u00e9r, between the periods of Crishna and Vicrama. The powers of nature were personified, and each quality, mental and physical, had its emblem, which the Brahmans taught the ignorant to adopt as realities, till the pantheon became so crowded that life would be too short to acquire even the nomenclature of their \"thirty-three millions of gods.\"* No object was too high or too base; from the glorious Orb to the paring-knife (Rampi) of the shoemaker. In illustration of the increase of polytheism, I shall, by and bye, describe the \"seven forms\" (sat'h-rupa) under which Crishna is worshipped, whose statues are established in the various capitals of Rajast'han, and are occasionally brought together at the festival of Ancuta at Nat'hdwara.\n\nThe international wars of the Suryas and the Yadu races are described in the Ramayuna and Mahabharat, though lost between allegory and literal interpretation. The Suryas, or Saiv\u00e1s, were depressed; and the Ind\u00fas, who counted \"fifty-six\" grand tribes, under the particular appellations of Takshac (serpent), Asva (horse), Sassu (hare), &c., &c., and collectively Indu, had paramount sway. Crishna's schism produced a new type, that of the eagle, and the wars of the schismatics were depicted under their respective emblems, the eagle and serpent, of which latter most probably were the C\u00far\u00fas, the political adversaries of the Pand\u00fas, who were the\n\n---\n\nThe Paratace (Mountain-Tak) of Alexander were doubtless of this race, as was his ally Taxi-les, which appellation was titular, as he was called Omphis till his father's death.\n\nTaxiles may be compounded of es, lord or chief, sila, rock or mountain, and Tak\u2014\"lord of the mountain Tak,\" whose capital was in the range west of the Indus. We are indebted to the Emperor Baber for the exact position of the capital of this celebrated race, which he passed in his route of conquest. We have, however, an intermediate notice of it between Alexander and Baber, in the early history of the Yadu Bhatti, who came in conflict with the Taks on their expulsion from Zabulist'han and settlement in the Punj\u00e1b.\n\n* Tyntes crore devata.\nrelatives of CRISHNA. The allegory of CRISHNA's eagle pursuing the serpent (BUDDHA), and recovering the books of science and religion with which he fled, is an important historical fact disguised: namely, that of CRISHNA incorporating the doctrines redeemed from BUDDHA after the expulsion of the Buddhists from India. Dare we further attempt to lift the veil from this mystery, and seek in the seat of the redemption of lost science or wisdom (BUDDHA), its original source?\"* The gulf of Kutch, the point where the serpent attempted to escape, has been from time immemorial to the present day, the entrep\u00f4t for the commerce of Sofala, the Red Sea, Egypt, and Arabia. There BUDDHA TRIVICORAMA, or Mercury, has been and is yet invoked by the Indian mariners, especially the pirates of Dwarica. Did BUDDHA or Mercury come from, or escape to the Nile? Is he the Hermes of Egypt to whom the \"four books of science,\" the V\u00e9dast of the Hindus, were sacred? The representative of BUDDHA at the period of CRISHNA was NEMA-NAT'H; he is of a black complexion,\u2020 with full lips, and his statues exactly resemble in feature the bust of young Memnon. His symbol is the snake.\n\nI have already observed that CRISHNA, before his deification, worshipped BUDDHA; and his temple at Dwarica rose over the ancient shrine of the latter, which yet stands. In an inscription from the cave of Gaya their characters are conjoined, \"Heri who is Buddha.\" According to western mythology, Apollo and Mercury exchanged symbols, the caduceus for the lyre: so likewise in India their characters intermingle; and even the Saiva propitiates HERI-CRISHNA as the mediator and disposer of the \"divine spark\" (jote) on its re-union with the \"parent flame:\" and thus, like Mercury, he may be said to be the conveyer of the souls of the dead. Accordingly in funereal lamentation his name only is invoked, and Heri-bol! Heri-bol! is emphatically pronounced by those conveying the corpse to its final abode.\n\nThe vahan (qu. the Saxon van?) or celestial car of CRISHNA, in which the souls (ansa) of the just are conveyed to Surya-Mandal, the mansion of the\n\n* In this peninsula and the adjacent continent was the cradle of Buddhism, and here are three of the 'five' sacred mounts of their faith, i.e. Girnar, Satrunja, and Abu. The author purposes giving, hereafter, an account of his journey through these classic regions.\n\n\u2020 The Buddhists and Jains are stigmatized as V\u00e9dyan, which signifying 'possessed of science,' is interpreted 'magician.'\n\n\u2021 Hence called Arishta-Nemi, 'the black Nemi.'\nsun, is painted like himself, blue, and with the eagle's head; and here he partakes both of the Mercury of the Greeks and of Oulios, the Preserver or Saviour, one of the titles of Apollo at Delos.\n\nThe Tatar nations, who are all of Indu race, like the Rajputs (and German tribes) adored the moon (Indu) as a male divinity, and to his son, Buddha, they assign the same character of mediator. The serpent is alike the symbol of the Buddha of the Hindus, the Hermes of the Egyptians, and the Mercury of Greece: and the allegory of the dragon's teeth, the origin of letters, brought by Cadmus from Egypt, is a version of the Hindu fable of Kaniya (Apollo) wresting the Vedas (secrets) from Buddha or wisdom (Hermes), under his sign, the serpent or dragon. We might still further elucidate the resemblance, and by an analysis of the titles and attributes of Krishna, the Hindu Apollo, prove that from the Yamuna may have been supplied the various incarnations (avatars) of this divinity which peopled the pantheons of Egypt, Greece, and Rome. As Nomios, who attended the herds of Admetus, we have Nonita, the infantine appellation of Kaniya, when he pastured the kine of Cesava in the woods of Vindra, whence the ceremony of the sons of princes assuming the crook, and on particular days tending the flocks. When I heard the octogenarian ruler of Kotah ask his grandson, \"Bappa-lal, have you been tending the cows to-day?\" my surprise was converted into pleasure on the origin of the custom being thus classically explained. As Murali-dhara, or the 'flute-holder,' Kaniya is the god of music; and in giving him the shepherd's reed instead of the vina or lyre, we may conjecture that the simple bhans (bamboo) which formed the first flute (bhansli) was in use before the chatara,* the Grecian cythara,\u2020 the first invented lyre of Apollo. Thus from the six-wired instrument of the Hindus we have the Greek cythara, and the Spanish guitar of modern days.\n\n* From cha, six; and tar, a string or wire.\n\n\u2020 Strabo says, the Greeks consider music as originating from Thrace and Asia, of which countries were Orpheus, Museus, &c., and that others \"qui regardent toute l'Asie jusqu'\u00e0 l'Inde comme un pays consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 Dionysius, rapportent \u00e0 cette contr\u00e9e l'invention de presque toutes les parties de la musique. Nous les voyons tant\u00f4t qualifier la Cythare d'Asiatique, tant\u00f4t donner aux flutes les \u00e9pith\u00e8tes de Phrygiennes. Les noms de certains instrumens, tels que Nablas ou Nabla et d'autres encore, sont tir\u00e9s des langues barbares.\" This Nabla of Strabo is possibly the Tabla, the small tabor of India. If Strabo took his orthography from the Persian or Arabic, a single point would constitute the difference between the N (\u0646) and the T (\u062a).\nGreeks, following the Egyptians, had but six notes, with their lettered symbols; and it was reserved for the Italians to add a seventh. Guido Ar\u00e9tine, a monk in the thirteenth century, has the credit of this. I however believe the Hindus numbered their's from the heavenly bodies\u2014the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,\u2014hence they had the regular octave, with its semitones: and as, in the pruiciency of their fancy, they converted the ascending and descending notes into grahas, or planetary bodies, so they may have added them to the harmonious numbers, and produced the no-ragini, their nine modes of music.*\n\nCould we affirm that the hymns composed and set to music by Jyd\u00e9va, nearly three thousand years ago, and yet chaunted in honour of the Apollo of Vrij, had been handed down with the sentiments of these mystic compositions (and Sir W. Jones sanctions the idea), we should say from their simplicity, that the musicians of that age had only the diatonic scale; but we have every reason to believe, from the very elaborate character of their written music, which is painful and almost discordant to the ear from its minuteness of subdivision, that they had also the chromatic scale, said to have been invented by Timotheus in the time of Alexander, who might have carried it from the banks of the Indus, then peopled with the worshippers of Crishna. In the mystic dance called the Ras-mandala, yet imitated on the annual festival sacred to the Hindu Apollo, Crishna is represented with a radiant crown, his legs crossed in a dancing attitude, playing on the m\u00fbrali or flute, to the nymphs encircling him, who all hold musical instruments. Each nymph represents a passion (rasa): hence the no-rasa, or 'nine passions,' excited by the powers of harmony. These nymphs are also called the no-ragini, from r\u00e2ga, a mode of song over which each presides. May we not in this trace the origin of Apollo and the sacred nine? In the\n\n* An account of the state of musical science amongst the Hindus of early ages, and a comparison between it and that of Europe, is yet a desideratum in Oriental literature. From what we already know of the science, it appears to have attained a theoretical precision yet unknown to Europe, and that, at a period when even Greece was little removed from barbarism. The inspirations of the bards of the first ages were all set to music; and the children of the most powerful potentates of both races (Surya and Chandra) sang the episodes of the great epics of Valmika and Vyasu. There is a distinguished member of our Society, and perhaps, the only one, who could fill up this hiatus; and we may hope that the leisure and inclination of the Right Honourable Sir Gore Ouseley will tempt him to enlighten us on this most interesting point.\nmanner described above, the *ras-mandal* is sculptured in *alto-rilievo* in the vaulted temples dedicated to the god,* or in secular edifices by way of ornament; as in the triumphal column of Chitore. On the festival of the *Jenem*, or 'birth-day,' there is a scenic representation of *Kaniya* and the *Gopis* (Apollo and the muses): when are rehearsed in the mellifluous accents of the Ionic land of Vrij, the songs of *Jydeva*, as addressed by *Kaniya* to *Radha* and the *Gopis*. A specimen of these, as translated by that elegant scholar Sir W. Jones, may not be considered inappropriate here.\n\nI have had occasion to remark elsewhere\u2020 that the Rajput bards, like the heroic Scalds of the north, lose no opportunity of lauding themselves; and *Jydeva*, the bard of the *Yadus*, has set an eminent example of this in the opening of \"the songs of Govinda.\"\n\n\"If thy soul be delighted with the remembrance of *Heri*, or sensible to \"the raptures of love, listen to the voice of Jydeva, whose notes are both \"sweet and brilliant.\"\n\nThe poet opens the first interview of *Krishna* and *Radha* with an animated description of a night in the rainy season, in which *Heri* is represented as a wanderer, and *Radha*, daughter of the shepherd *Nanda*, is sent to offer him shelter in their cot. *Nanda* thus speaks to *Radha*: \"The \"firmament is obscured by clouds; the woodlands are black with *Tamila* \"trees; that youth who roves in the forest will be fearful in the gloom of \"night; go, my daughter, bring the wanderer home to my rustic mansion. \"Such was the command of *Nanda* the herdsman, and hence arose the \"love of *Radha* and *Madhava*.\"\u2021\n\nThe poet proceeds to apostrophize *Heri*, which the Hindu bard terms *rupaca*, or \"personal description:\"\n\n\"O thou who reclinest on the bosom of *Camala*, whose ears flame with \"gems, and whose locks are embellished with sylvan flowers, thou, from \"whom the day-star derived his effulgence, who slewest the venom-\n\n---\n\n*I have often been struck with a characteristic analogy in the sculptures of the most ancient Saxon cathedrals in England and on the continent, to *Kaniya* and the *Gopis*.

But Radha, indignant that he should divide with them the affec-\ntion she deemed exclusively her own, flies his presence. Heri, repentant\nand alarmed, now searches the forest for his beloved, giving vent at each step\nto an impassioned grief. \"Woe is me! she feels a sense of injured honour,\nand has departed in wrath. How will she conduct herself? How will she\nexpress her pain in so long a separation? What is wealth to me? What\nare numerous attendants? What the pleasures of the world?

I love already but too passionately; yet have I\nlost my beloved. Brace not thy bow, thou conqueror of the world!\nMy heart is already pierced by arrows from Radha's eyes, black and\nkeen as those of the antelope.\"\n\nRadha relents and sends a damsel in quest of Heri, whom she finds in\na solitary arbour on the banks of the Yamuna. She describes her mistress\nas animated by the same despair which controls him:\n\n\"Her face is like a water lily veiled in the dew of tears, and her eyes\nare as moons eclipsed. She draws thy picture and worships it, and at the\nclose of every sentence exclaims, 'O Madhava, at thy feet am I fallen!'\nThen she figures thee standing before her: she sighs, she smiles,\nshe mourns, she weeps. Her abode, the forest\u2014herself through thy\nabsence is become a timid roe, and love is the tiger who springs on her\nlike Yama, the genius of death. So emaciated is her beautiful body,\nthat even the light garland which waves o'er her bosom is a load. The\npalm of her hand supports her aching temple, motionless as the crescent\nrising at eve. Thus, O divine healer, by the nectar of thy love must\nRadha be restored to health; and if thou refusest, thy heart must be\nharder than the thunder-stone.\"*\n\n* We meet with various little philosophical phenomena used as similies in this rhapsody of\nJydeva. These aerolites, mentioned by a poet the contemporary of David and Solomon, are\nbut recently known to the European philosopher.\nThe damsel returns to Radha and reports the condition of Heri, mourning her absence: \"Even the hum of the bee distracts him. Misery sits fixed in his heart, and every returning night adds anguish to anguish.\" She then recommends Radha to seek him. \"Delay not, O, loveliest of women; follow the lord of thy heart. Having bound his locks with forest flowers, he hastens to yon arbour, where a soft gale breathes over the banks of Yamuna, and there pronouncing thy name he modulates his divine reed. Leave behind thee, O friend, the ring which tinkles on thy delicate ankle when thou sportest in the dance. Cast over thee thy azure mantle and run to the shady bower.\"\n\nBut Radha, too weak to move, is thus reported to Heri by the same fair mediator. \"She looks eagerly on all sides in hope of thy approach: she advances a few steps and falls languid to the ground. She weaves bracelets of fresh leaves, and looking at herself in sport, exclaims, behold the vanquisher of Madha! Then she repeats the name of Heri, and catching at a dark blue cloud,* strives to embrace it, saying, 'It is my beloved who approaches.'\"\n\nMidnight arrives, but neither Heri nor the damsel returns, when she gives herself up to the frenzy of despair, exclaiming: \"the perfidy of my friend rends my heart. Bring disease and death, O gale of Malaya! Receive me in thy azure wave, O sister of Yama,+ that the ardour of my heart may be allayed.\"\n\nThe repentant Heri at length returns, and in speech well calculated to win forgiveness, thus pleads his pardon.\n\n\"Oh! grant me a draught of honey from the lotus of thy mouth: or if thou art inexorable, grant me death from the arrows of thine eyes; make thy arms my chains: thou art my ornament; thou art the pearl in the ocean of my mortal birth! Thine eyes, which nature formed like blue water-lilies, are become through thy resentment like petals of the crimson lotus! Thy silence affects me; oh! speak with the voice of music, and let thy sweet accents allay my ardour.\"\n\nRadha with timid joy, darting her eyes on Govinda, while she musically sounded the rings of her ankles and the bells of her zone,\u2020 entered\n\n* This is in allusion to the colour of Krishna, a dark blue.\n\u2020 The Indian Pluto; she is addressing the Yamuna.\n\u2021 Thus the ancient statues do not present merely the sculptor's fancy in the zone of bells with which they are ornamented.\n\"the mystic bower of her beloved. His heart was agitated by her sight,\n\"as the waves of the deep are affected by the lunar orb.* From his grace-\n\"ful waist flowed a pale yellow robe, which resembled the golden dust of\n\"the water-lily scattered over its blue petals.+ His locks interwoven with\n\"blossoms were like a cloud variegated by the moon-beam. Tears of\n\"transport gushed in a stream from the full eyes of Radha, and their\n\"watery glances beamed on her best beloved. Even shame, which had\n\"before taken its abode in their dark pupils, was itself ashamed,\u2021 and\n\"departed when the fawn-eyed Radha gazed on the bright face of\n\"Crishna.\"\n\nThe deified Yadu is now all tenderness and affection: and the poet pro-\nceeds to describe Apollo's bower on the sable Yamuna, in language equally\nimpassioned with that of the first of modern bards; as \"Love's recess,\"\nwhere, \"he who has loved not, here would learn that lore,\" and like him\nthe Hindu sanctifies it as\n\n\"The ground\nWhere early Love his Psyche's zone unbound.\"\u00a7\n\nIn the morning the blue god aids in Radha's simple toilet. He stains\nher eye with antimony \"which would make the blackest bee envious,\"\nplaces \"a circle of musk on her forehead,\" and intertwines \"a chaplet of\nflowers and peacock's feathers in her dark tresses,\" replacing \"the zone of\ngolden bells.\"\n\nThe bard concludes as he commenced, with an eulogium on the inspira-\ntions of his muse, which it is evident were set to music. \"Whatever is\n\"delightful in the modes of music, whatever is graceful in the fine strains\n\"of poetry, whatever is exquisite in the sweet art of love, let the happy\n\"and wise learn from the songs of Jydeva.\"\n\nTo return from this digression. This mystic dance, the Ras-mandal,\n\n* This is a favourite metaphor with the bards of India, to describe the alternations of the\nexciting causes of love: and it is yet more important as shewing that Jydeva was the philosopher\nas well as the poet of nature, in making the action of the moon upon the tides the basis of this\nbeautiful simile.\n\n\u2020 It will be again necessary to call to mind the colour of Crishna, to appreciate this elegant\nmetaphor.\n\n\u2021 This idea is quite new.\n\n\u00a7 Childe Harold, Canto III.\nappears analogous to the Pyrric or fire-dance of the Egyptians. The movements of those who personate the deity and his fair companions are full of grace, and the dialogue is replete with harmony.* The Chobist of Mat'hura and Vindravana have considerable reputation as vocalists; and the effect of the well modulated deep tones of the adult blending with the clear treble of the juvenile performers, while the time is marked by the cymbal or the soothing monotony of the tabor, occasionally mingled with the m\u00fbrali or flute, is very pleasing.\n\nWe may even find a Parnassus for Kaniya in Girdhana, from which sacred hill he derives one of his principal epithets, Girdhan or Gordhun-nat'h, 'God of the mount of wealth.' Here he first gave proofs of miraculous power, and a cave in this hill was the first shrine on his apotheosis, whence his miracles and oracles were made known to the Yadus. From this cave (Gop'ha) is another of his titles\u2014Gop'hnat'h, 'Lord of the cave,' distinct from his epithet Gopi-nat'h, 'Lord of the Gopis,' or pastoral nymphs. On the annual festival held at Girdhana, the sacred mount is purified with copious oblations of milk, for which all the cows of the district are in requisition.\n\nThe worship of Crishna in ancient days, like that of Apollo amongst the Greeks, was chiefly celebrated in caves, of which there were many scattered over India. The most remarkable were those of Girdhana in Vrij; Gaya in Bahar; Gop'h-nat'h on the shores of Saurashtra; and Jalindra \u2020 on the Indus. In these dark and mysterious retreats superstition had her full influence over the votaries who sought the commands of the deity, and desired to appease him; but as the Mukhia told the author, \"the age of\n\n* The anniversary of the birth of Kaniya is celebrated with splendour at Sindia's court, where the author frequently witnessed it, during a ten years' residence.\n\n\u2020 The priests of Kaniya, probably so called from the chob or club with which, on the annual festival, they assault the castle of Kansa, the tyrant usurper of Crishna's birthright, who, like Herod, ordered the slaughter of all the youth of Vrij, that Crishna might not escape. These Chobii are most likely the Sobii of Alexander, who occupied the chief towns of the Punjab, and who, according to Arrian, worshipped the Hercules (Heri-cu-les, qu. Herakles?) chief of the race of Heri, and were armed with clubs. The mimic assault of Kansa's castle by some hundreds of these robust church militants, with their long clubs covered with iron rings, is well worth seeing.\n\n\u2021 Jalindra on the Indus is described by the Emperor Baber as a very singular spot, having numerous caves. The deity of the caves of Jalindra is the tutelary deity of the Prince of Marwar.\noracles and miracles is past;\" and even the new wheel that was miraculously applied each revolving year to supply the place of that which first indicated CRISHNA's desire to abide at Nat'hdwara, is no longer furnished. The old one which was the signal of his wish, is, however, preserved as a holy relic, and held in great reverence. The statue now worshipped at Nat'hdwara as the representative of \"the god of the mount,\" is said to be the identical image first raised to CRISHNA in the cave of Girdhana, and brought thence by the high priest BALBA ACHARYA.\n\nAs the destroyer of KALI-NAG, 'the black serpent,' which infested the waters of the Yamuna, KANIYA has the character of the Pythic Apollo. He is represented dragging the monster from the 'black stream' (Kali-Yamuna), and bruising him with his foot. CRISHNA had however many battles with his hydra foe ere he vanquished him, and he was once driven by KAL-YAMUN from Vrij to Dwarica, whence his title of RINCHOR, as \"abandoning the fight.\" Here we have the old allegory of the schismatic wars of the Buddhists and Vishnu\u00e9s.\n\nDiodorus informs us that Kan was one of the titles of the Egyptian Apollo; and this is the common contraction for KANIXA. The colour of the Hindu Apollo is a dark cerulean blue (nila): hence he is occasionally called NILA-NAT'H, 'the blue god,' as well as SHAM-NAT'H, 'the black god,' and he is invariably represented with the lotus in his hand; and like the Apollo of the Nile, KANIYA is depicted with the human form and eagle-head, one of the common hieroglyphic deities of Egypt.\n\nSHAM-NAT'H and SHI-NAT'H, the black divinity, are the commonest epithets of CRISHNA, which name likewise means 'black.' It is curious that his cotemporary and relative NEMI-NAT'H, the twenty-second high priest of BUDDHA, was also designated from his black colour, Arisht Nemi: are we to bring both from the Nile, or to send them there from the Indus? S and H are permutable letters in the Bhakka, and SAM or SHAM, the god of the Yamuna, may be the Ham or Hammon of Egypt. The most marked resemblances may be traced between the Ram\u00e9sa of Ayodhia, and the Rameses of Egypt; and HERI, the Indian Apollo, accompanied RAM\u00c9SA to Lanka, as did the Egyptian Apollo, Ram\u00e9ses, Sesostris on his expedition to India. The Hindu RAM\u00c9SA in all the mythological paintings is of the same blue colour as CRISHNA; both were attended in their expedition by an army of Satyrs, or tribes bearing the names of different animals: and as we have the Aswas, the Takshacs, and the Sassus of the Yadu tribes, typified under\nthe horse, the serpent, and the hare, so, the race of Surya, of which Rama was the head, may have designated their tribes the Rishi, Hanuman, &c., bears and monkeys. Whether Rameses found his way from the Nile to the Ganges, or whether Ramesa found his Lanka on the shores of the Red Sea, we can but conjecture. The Hindu scorns the idea that the rock Ceylon was the abode of Rama's enemy. The distance of the Nile from the Indian shore forms no objection to the surmise; the sail that spread for Ceylon could waft to the Red Sea, which the fleets of Tyre, of Solomon, and Hiram covered about this very time. That the Hindus navigated the ocean from the earliest ages, the traces of their religion in the isles of the Indian archipelago sufficiently attest.\n\nThe coincidence between the most common epithets of the Apollos of Greece and India, as applied to the sun, are peculiarly striking. Heri is also called Bhan-nat'h, 'the lord of beams,' or Ph\u0153bus, and his heaven is Herip\u00fbr (Heliopolis), or 'city of Heri.'* Helios (\u0397\u03bb\u03af\u03bf\u03c2) was a title of Apollo, whence the Greeks had their Elysium (\u0395\u03bb\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd), the Herip\u00fbr or Bhan-t'han, 'the abode of the sun,' the highest of the heavens or abodes of bliss of the martial Rajp\u00fat. Hence the eagle is a fit emblem of Heri as the sun.\u2020\n\nThe Diu Majores of the Rajp\u00fat are the same in number and title as amongst the Greeks and Romans, being the deities who figuratively preside over the planetary system. Their grades of bliss are therefore in unison with the eccentricity of orbit of the planet named. On this account Chandra or Indu, the moon, being a mere satellite of Ella, the earth, though probably originating the name of the Indu race, is inferior in the scale of blissful abodes to that of his son Buddha or Mercury, whose heliacal\n\n---\n\n* \"In Hebrew heres signifies the sun, but in Arabic the meaning of the radical word is to guard, preserve; and of haris, guardian, preserver.\"\u2014Volney's Ruins of Empires, p. 316.\n\n\u2020 The heaven of Vishnu, called Vaic\u00fbnt'ha, is entirely of gold, and 80,000 miles in circumference. Its edifices, pillars, and ornaments, are composed of precious stones. The crystal waters of the Ganges form a river in Vaic\u00fbnt'ha, where are lakes filled with blue, red, and white water-lilies, each of a hundred and even a thousand petals. On a throne glorious as the meridian sun, resting on water-lilies, is Vishn\u00fb, with Lacs\u00fbmi or Sri, the goddess of abundance (the Ceres of the Egyptians and Greeks), on his right hand, surrounded by spirits who constantly celebrate the praise of Vishn\u00fb and Lacs\u00fbmi, who are served by his votaries, and to whom the eagle (garuda) is door-keeper.\u2014Extract from the Mahabharat.\u2014See Ward on the History and Religion of the Hindus, vol. ii. p. 14.\nappearance gave him importance even with the sons of Vaiva (Vaivasvata) the sun. From the poetic seers of the martial races we learn that there are two distinct places of reward: the one essentially spiritual, the other of a material nature. The bard inculcates that the warrior who falls in battle in the fulfilment of his duty, \"who abandons life through the wave of steel,\" will know no \"second birth,\" but that the unconfined spark (jote) will reunite to the parent orb. The doctrine of transmigration through a variety of hideous forms, may be considered as a series of purgatories.\n\nThe Greeks and Celts worshipped Apollo under the title of Carneios, which \"selon le scholiaste de Th\u00e9ocrite\" is derived from Carnos, \"qui ne proph\u00e9tisoit que des malheurs aux H\u00e9raclides lors de leur incursion dans le P\u00e9loponn\u00e8se. Un d'eux appel\u00e9 Hippot\u00e9s, le tua d'un coup de fl\u00e8che.\" Now one of the titles of Heri, the Hindu Apollo, is C\u00e1rana, 'the radiant:' from Carana, 'a ray' (of the sun). When Heri-Crishna led the remains of the Pandu Hercicil\u00e1s in company with the Hindu Hercules, Baldeva (the 'god of strength'), and Yudishtra, after the great international war (bharat) with the C\u00faris, into the Peloponnesus of Saurashtra, they were attacked by the aboriginal occupants, the Bhills, one of whom slew the divine C\u00e1rana with an arrow. The Bhills claim to be of Hywansa, or the race of Hya, whose chief seat was at Mah\u00e9swar on the Nerbudda: the assassin of C\u00e1rana would consequently be Hip\u00fala, or descendant (p\u00fata) of Hya.*\n\nThe most celebrated of the monuments commonly termed Druidic, scattered throughout Europe, is at Carnac in Brittany, on which coast the Celtic Apollo had his shrines, and was propitiated under the title of Carneus; and this monument may be considered at once sacred to the manes of the warriors and the sun-god Carneus. Thus the Roman Saturnalia, the carnival, has a better etymology in the festival to Carneus, as the sun, than in the \"adieu to flesh\" during the fast. The character of this festival is entirely oriental, and accompanied with the licentiousness which belonged to the celebration of the powers of nature. Even now, although Christianity has banished the grosser forms, it partakes more of a Pagan than a Christian ceremony.\n\n* Supposing these coincidences in the fabulous history of the ancient nations of Greece and Asia to be merely fortuitous, they must excite interest; but conjoined with various others in the history of the Hercicil\u00e1s of India and the Heraclidae of Greece, I cannot resist the idea that they were connected, and that Ramesa, Heri, Buddha, and Yudishtra, &c. &c. were conquerors or hierarchs deified.\nApollo, besides being honoured as a deity presiding over the healing art, was especially invoked by the Greeks in epidemic disorders; and the shrines of Crishna were thronged with votaries beseeching him to avert that scourge, emphatically called marri, or death; the cholera, yet raging in India.\n\nBut I have trespassed too long with these analogies, and must proceed to describe some of the chief festivals of the Apollo of Nat\u2019hdwara, of which the anniversary of his birth (Jenem), the Jhuljhluni, or swinging on the water, and the Anc\u00fata are the most remarkable. The latter, as the more imposing of the three, may satisfy curiosity. On this occasion the seven forms or statues (sat\u2019h-r\u00fapa) of Heri-Crishna are brought together from the different capitals of Rajast\u2019han, when mountains (c\u00fata) of food (an) are piled up for their repast, and at a given signal attacked and levelled by the myriads of votaries assembled from all parts.\n\nAbout eighty years ago, on a memorable assemblage at the Anc\u00fata, before warfare had devastated Rajast\u2019han and circumscribed the means of the faithful disciples of Heri, amongst the multitude of Vishnu\u00e9s of every region were almost all the Rajp\u00fat princes; Rana Ursi of M\u00e9war, Raja Bijy Sing of Marwar, Raja Guj Sing of Bikan\u00e9r, and Buhad\u00far Sing of Kishengurh. Rana Ursi presented to the god a tora, or massive golden anklet-chain set with emeralds: Bijy Sing a diamond necklace worth 25,000 rupees: the other princes according to their means. They were followed by an old woman of Surat with infirm step and shaking head, who deposited four coppers in the hand of the high-priest, which were received with a gracious smile, not vouchsafed to the lords of the earth. \u201cThe R\u00e1nd is in luck,\u201d whispered the chief of Kishengurh to the Rana. Soon afterwards the statue of Heri was brought forth, when the same old woman placed at its feet a bill of exchange for 70,000 rupees (35,000 crowns). The mighty were humbled, and the smile of the Gosa\u00e9n was explained. Such gifts, and to a yet greater amount are, or were, far from uncommon from the sons of commerce, who are only known to belong to the flock from the distinguishing necklace (canti) of the sect.*\n\nThat predatory system which reduced these countries to a state of the most degraded anarchy, greatly diminished the number of pilgrimages to\n\n* Gibbon records a similar offering of 200,000 sesterces to the Roman church, by a stranger, in the reign of Decius.\nNat\u2019hdwara; and the gods of Vrij had sufficient prescience to know that they could guard neither their priests nor followers from the Pat\u2019han and Mahratta, to whom the crown (m\u016bkta) of the god, and the nutna (nose-jewel) of Radha would be alike acceptable: nor would they have scrupled to retain both the deities and priests as hostages for such imposition as they might deem within their means. Accordingly, of late years, there had been no congress of the gods of Vrij, who remained fixtures on their altars, till the halcyon days of A.D. 1818 permitted their liberation.*\n\nThe Sat\u2019h-r\u016bpa, or seven statues of Kaniya, are the forms he assumed in the Ras-mandala, or mystic dance, with Radha and the Gopis. Balba Acharya, the high-priest of Krishna, first collected these, and having brought them together established the festival of the Anc\u016bta. The different images remained in the same sanctuary, or at least under one supreme head, until the time of Giridhari, the grandson of Balba, who having seven sons, gave to each a r\u016bpa, and their descendants continue in the office of priest. The names and present abodes of the gods are as follows:\n\nNat\u2019h-ji, the god, or Gordan-Nat\u2019h, god of the mount......Nat\u2019hdwara.\n\n| 1. Non\u012bta | Nat\u2019hdwara. |\n| 2. Mat\u2019hura Nat\u2019h | Kotah. |\n| 3. Dwar-ca Nat\u2019h | Kankerowli. |\n| 4. Gokul-Nat\u2019h, or Gokul Chandrama | Jeip\u016br. |\n| 5. Yadu-Nat\u2019h | Surat. |\n| 6. Vitul-Nat\u2019h | Kotah. |\n| 7. Mudhun Mohuna | Jeip\u016br. |\n\nThese names are derived either from some peculiar attribute or from the original seat of the shrine. The god, Nat\u2019h-ji, is not enumerated amongst the forms; he stands supreme over all.\n\n\u2020 I enjoyed no small degree of favour with the supreme pontiff of the shrine of Apollo and all his votaries, for effecting a meeting of the seven statues of Vishnu. In contriving this, I had not only to reconcile ancient animosities between the priests of the different shrines, in order to obtain a free passport for the gods, but to pledge myself to the princes in whose capitals they were established, for their safe return: for they dreaded lest bribery might entice the priests to fix them elsewhere, which would have involved their loss of sanctity, dignity, and prosperity. It cost me no little trouble, and still more anxiety, to keep the assembled multitudes at peace with each other, for they are as outrageous as any sectarians in contesting the supreme power and worth of their respective forms (r\u016bpa). Yet they all separated not only without violence, but without even any attempt at robbery, so common on those occasions.\nNonita, or Nonanda, is the juvenile Kaniya, who has his altar separate, though close to Nat\u2019hi. He is also styled Bala-Mokund, \u2018the blessed child,\u2019 and is depicted as an infant with a p\u00e9ra* or comfit ball in his hand. This image, which was one of the penates of a former age, and which, since the destruction of the shrines of Krishna by the Islamites, had lain in the Yamuna, attached itself to the sacerdotal zone (zunu) of the high priest Balba, while he was performing his ablutions, who, carrying it home, placed it in a niche of the temple and worshipped it: and Nonanda yet receives the peculiar homage of the high-priest (a lineal descendant of Balba) and his family as their household divinity. Of the second image, Mat\u2019hura Nat\u2019hi, there is no particular mention; it was at one time at Kamnorh in M\u00e9war, but is now at Kotah.\n\nIt has been stated that each of the seven sons of the high-priest had an image of the god intrusted to him. These sons had all appellations appertaining to the deity; and Balcrishna, the third son, had Dwar-ca Nat\u2019hi made over to his keeping. This statue, now at Kankerowli in M\u00e9war, is asserted to be the identical image which received the adoration of Raja Umrika, a prince of the solar race who lived in the Satya Yuga, or silver age. The \u2018god of the mount\u2019 (Gird\u2019han Nath) revealed himself in a dream to his high-priest, and told him of the domicile of this his representative at Kanouj. Thither Balba repaired, and having obtained it from the Brahman, appointed Damodur-das Khetri to officiate at his altar, on whose death it reverted to Balba. This image like the rest is only a duplicate of the divinity, the original being in the Saurashtra peninsula.\n\nThe fourth statue, that of Gokul-Nat\u2019hi, or Gokul Chandrama (i.e., the moon of Gokul), had an equally mysterious origin, having been discovered in a deep ravine on the banks of the river; Balba assigned it to his brother-in-law. Gokul is an island on the Jumna, a few miles below Mat\u2019hura, and celebrated in the early history of the pastoral divinity. The possession of this image by Jaya-pur does not deprive the little island of its honours as a place of pilgrimage; for the \u2018god of Gokul\u2019 has an altar on the original site, and his rites are performed by an aged priestess, who disowns the jurisdiction of the high-priest of Nat\u2019hdwara, both in the spiritual and temporal concerns of her shrine; and who, to the no small scandal of all\n\n---\n\n* The p\u00e9ra of Mat\u2019hura can only be made from the waters of the Yamuna, from whence it is yet conveyed to Nonanda at Nat\u2019hdwara, and with curds forms his evening repast.\nwho are interested in Apollo, appealed from the fiat of the high-priest to the British adawlut, or court of justice. The royal grants of the Mogul emperors were produced, which proved the right to lay in the high-priest, though a long period of almost undisturbed authority had created a feeling of independent control in the family of the priestess, which they desired might continue. A compromise ensued, when the author was instrumental in restoring harmony to the shrines of Apollo.\n\nThe fifth, Yadu-Nat'h, \"God of the Yadus,\" is the deified ancestor of Crishna and the whole Yadu race. This image, now at Surat, formerly adorned the shrine of Mahavan near Mat'hura, which was destroyed by Mahmud.\n\nThe sixth, Vitul-Nat'h, or Pandurang, was found in the Ganges at Benares, Samvat 1572, from which we may judge of their habit of multiplying divinities.\n\nThe seventh, Mudhun Mohuna, \"he who intoxicates with desire,\" the seductive lover of Radha and the Gopis, has his rites performed by a female. The present priestess of Mohuna is the mother of Damodra, the supreme head of all who adore the Apollo of Vrij.\n\nI am not aware of the precise period of Balba Acharya, who thus collected and distributed the seven images of Crishna now in Rajast'han; but he must have lived about the time of the last of the Lodi kings, at the period of the conquest of India by the Moguls. The present pontiff, Damodra, as before said, is his lineal descendant; and whether in addressing him verbally or by letter, he is styled Maharaja or 'great prince.' \"Gosdenji Maharaja\" is his common epithet. Gosden is a title more applicable to the celibataire worshippers of Hari than of Heri\u2014of Jupiter than of Apollo; signifying one who has obtained a mastery over his passions. It is alleged that the Emperor Akber first bestowed this epithet on the high priest of Crishna, whose rites attracted his regard. They were previously called \"Dikhit,\" \"one who performs sacrifice,\" a name given to a very numerous class of Brahmans.\n\nThe Gotra Acharya or genealogical creed of the high priest is as follows: \"Tylung Brahmin, Bhardhwaja gotra,* G\u00fbra-c\u00fbla,\u2020 Tyturi sac'ha; i.e. Brah-\n\n* Bhardhwaja was a celebrated founder of a sect in the early ages.\n\u2020 G\u00fbr is an epithet applied to Vrishpati, \"Lord of the Bull,\" the Indian Jupiter, who is called the G\u00fbr, preceptor or guardian of the gods.\nman of Telingana, of the tribe of Bhardhwaja, of the race of G\u00fbr, of the branch Tyturi.* As the supreme head of the Vishnu sect his person is held to be Ansa, or \"a portion of the divinity;\" and it is maintained that so late as the father of the present incumbent, Apollo manifested himself and conversed with the high priest. The present pontiff is now about thirty years of age. He is of a benign aspect, with much dignity of demeanour: courteous, yet conscious of the homage due to his high calling: meek, as becomes the priest of Govinda, yet with the finished manners of one accustomed to the first society. His features are finely moulded, and his complexion good. He is about the middle size, though as he rises to no mortal, I could not exactly judge of his height. When I saw him he had one only daughter, to whom he is much attached. He has but one wife, nor does Krishna allow polygamy to his priest, and what is yet more natural, he has interdicted sutees. In times of danger the high priest of Apollo, like some of his prototypes in the dark ages of Europe, poised the lance, and found it more effective than spiritual anathemas, against those who would first adore the god, and then plunder him. Such were the Mahratta chiefs, Jesswunt Rao Holkar and Bapu Sindia. Damodra accordingly made the tour of his extensive diocese at the head of four hundred horse, two standards of foot, and two field-pieces. He rode the finest mares in the country; laid aside his pontificals and the \"yellow mantle,\"\u2020 for the quilted dugla, and was summoned to matins by the kettle-drum instead of the bell and cymbal. In this he only imitated \"the black god,\" Shamnat'h, who often mixed in the ranks of battle, and \"dyed his saffron robe in the red-stained field.\" Had Damodra been captured on one of these occasions by any marauding Pat'han, and incarcerated, as he assuredly would have been, for ransom, the marauder might have replied to the Rana, as did the Plantagenet king to the Pope when the surrender of the captive church-militant bishop was demanded, \"Is this thy son Joseph's coat?\" But, notwithstanding this display of martial principle, which covered with a helmet the shaven crown, his conduct and character are amiable and unexceptionable, and he furnishes a striking contrast to the late head of the Vishnu establishments in Marwar, who commenced with the care of his master's conscience, and ended with that of the\n\n* I am not aware of the import of Tyturi.\n\n\u2020 Hence his epithet Pitumbra, under which he is worshipped by the Rana. Synonymous with this is the name of Pandurang, by which he is chiefly known in the Dekhan; from Pandu, yellow ocre, and rang, colour.\nstate; meek and unassuming till he added temporal* to spiritual power, which developed illimited pride, with all the qualities that too often wait on \"a little brief authority,\" and to the display of which he fell a victim. DAMODRA,+ similarly circumstanced, might have evinced the same failings, and have met the same end; but though endeavours were made to give him political influence at the Rana's court, yet, partly from his own good sense, and partly though the dissuasion of the Nestor of Kotah, he was not entrained in the vortex of its intrigues, which would have involved the sacrifice of wealth and the proper dignity of his station.\n\n* The high priest of Jalindra-nath used to appear at the head of a cavalcade far more numerous than any feudal lord of Marwar. A sketch of this personage will appear elsewhere. These Brahmans were not a jot behind the ecclesiastical lords of the middle ages, who are thus characterized:\u2014\"Les seigneurs eccl\u00e9siastiques, malgr\u00e9 l'humilit\u00e9 chr\u00e9tienne ne se sont pas \"montr\u00e9s moins orgueilleux que les nobles la\u00efcs.

R\u00e9gime, p. 380.\n\n\u2020 The first letter I received on reaching England after my long residence in India was from this priest, filled with anxious expressions for my health, and speedy return to protect the lands and sacred kine of Apollo.\n\nAPPENDIX.\n\nNo. I.\n\nGrant of the Rahtore Rani, the Queen-Mother of Udipur, on the death of her Son, the Heir-Apparent, Prince UMRA.\n\nSID SRI BURRA* RAHTOR-JI to the Patels and inhabitants of GIROH.

The frightened oilman demanded of the child who he was: \u2018A Brahman\u2019s orphan,\u2019 was the reply. Alarmed at the enormity of his guilt in thus employing the son of a priest, he covered the palm of his hand with earth, in which he sowed the tilasi seed, and went on a pilgrimage to Dwarica. He demanded the presence (dursuna) of the god; the priests pointed to the ocean, when he plunged in, and had an interview with Dwarica Nat\u2019hi, who presented him with a written order on the Rana for forty-five bigahs of land. He returned and threw the writing before the Rana, on the steps of the temple of Juggernat\u2019h. The Rana read the writing of the god, placed it on his head, and immediately made out the grant.

Accompanied by Plates.\n\nRead Dec. 6, 1828.\n\nThe accompanying drawings of some of the sculptures in the cave temples of Ellora were made in the year 1813; since which time, until very recently, they have been in the possession of the Honourable Lady Hood (now Mrs. Stewart Mackenzie), for whom they were executed: and I have availed myself of that lady's permission to make them public through the medium of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nThe superiority of these sculptures is universally acknowledged by all who have visited these stupendous excavations, as well as their antiquity over perhaps any other building now existing in India.\n\nThe magnificence of design, the justness of proportion, and the surpassing richness of ornament displayed in these shrines, have been already too well described by Mr. Erskine* to require any further mention here.\n\nThe four drawings represent the following subjects:\n\nNo. 1. Mah\u00e1d\u00e9va, Dacsha, and Nanda.\nNo. 2. Bhadra, or V\u00edra Bhadra.\nNo. 3. Jayad Ratha, called also Dyt\u00e0s\u00far Siva. Siva having obtained the chariot of Surya, or the sun, is in pursuit of the demon Tripura.\nNo. 4. Bhairava or Bhyru.\n\nIt may be proper to remark, that these figures are as nearly as possible fac-similes of the outlines made on the spot with the most scrupulous regard to accuracy of form and proportion, by a hand too unpractised to lend either embellishment or correction to the objects portrayed.\n\nThese figures will probably be received as evidence that the art of sculpture formerly existed in India in a much higher state of perfection\n\n* In the first volume of the Transactions of the Bombay Literary Society.\nthan is generally supposed; and this assumption is further confirmed by an arm from one of the colossal figures at Elephanta, now in the possession of Sir Charles Forbes, Bart. M.P., which is considered by artists to indicate a highly refined taste in sculpture.\n\nThe figures, as well as the ornamental sculpture at Ellora, are, however, of superior execution to those at Elephanta.\nXVII. Remarks on certain Sculptures in the Cave Temples of Ellora. By Lieut.-Colonel James Tod, M.R.A.S.\n\nRead Dec. 6, 1828.\n\nIt being deemed desirable that some explanation should accompany the interesting drawings, particularized in the preceding article on ancient Hindu sculptures from the Cave Temples of Ellora, made by Captain Grindlay, I hasten to fulfil the wishes of the council.\n\nThere are two modes by which they might receive illustration: one, supposing them to contain an astronomical allusion, as suggested by Dr. B. G. Babington; the other, from an allegory in the Hindu theogonies. A knowledge of the relative position of these sculptures in the Cave Temple would materially influence my decision on this point, as regards the two plates to which I shall chiefly confine my observations, viz. one, (No. 1) which I designate \"The Fable of Dacsha Prajapati, or Mahadeva, Dacsha, and Nanda;\" the other (No. 2) Vira-Bhadra.\" If these sculptures are contiguous to each other in the cave, then I have no doubt they represent the fable of the sacrifice of Sati, the consort of Mahadeva, and the formation of the giant Vira-Bhadra, to revenge her death by that of Dacsha: though even this allegory may possibly conceal an astronomical period.\n\nLet us first pay due attention to Dr. Babington's suggestion, that the central figure with a bird \"may represent the planet Mars (Carticeya) with his peacock, or Mercury (Buddha) with his eagle, or Saturn (Sani) with his raven; and that the personage placed between the two signs of the Zodiac, Misha or the Ram and Vrishabha the Bull, may have allusion to some particular position of the heavens.\"\n\nWe have a right to assume that the cave-worship of the Hind\u00fas had the same origin as among the ancient Persians, the Egyptians, and the Greeks, and that these caves were consecrated to rites whose bases were astronomical; and it is fair to infer that this worship originated amongst the Hind\u00fas, not confined to India proper, but from remote Scythia, embracing the caves\nof Bamian, of Jalindra, of Gaya, of Gwalior, of Dhumr\u0101r, of Ellora, and of Elephanta. \"Zoroaster\" (says Volney* quoting Eusebius) \"was the first who, having fixed upon a cavern pleasantly situated in the mountains adjacent to Persia, formed the idea of consecrating it to Mithra (the Sun), the creator and father of all things; and having made in this cavern several geometrical divisions representing the seasons and the elements, he imitated on a small scale the order and disposition of the universe by Mithra. In these caves they celebrated mysteries, which consisted in imitating the motion of the stars, the planets, and the heavens. The initiated took the names of constellations and assumed the figures of animals. One was a lion, another a raven, and a third a ram. Hence the use of masks in the first representation of the drama; of this nature were the mysteries of Ceres.\" But Volney will not allow Zoroaster the honour of the invention, which he says is due to the Egyptians, of which the caverns of Thebes, full of similar pictures, afford proof.\n\nThere is a powerful analogy, both architectural and mythological, between the cave temples of Ellora and Elephanta, and Elephantine in Egypt, where certain emblematic figures appear to have the same character as those under discussion. \"At Elephantine (says Volney, still quoting Eusebius) they worshipped the figure of a man in a sitting posture, painted blue, having the head of a ram and the horns of a goat which encompassed a disc: all of which represented the sun's and moon's conjunction in the sign of the ram: the blue colour denoting the power of the moon at the period of junction to raise water into clouds.\"\n\nI have little doubt that the central figure is Mah\u0101deva, the creative power: and that he sometimes represents the solar deity, we have the best proof in seeing his monolithic emblem in the sun-temples of the ancient sun-worshippers (Sauras, the \u03a3\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 of Strabo) of Saurashtra, where he is called B\u0101l-n\u0101th, B\u0101l-c\u00e9sar,\u2020 B\u0101l-p\u016bra, Mah\u0101deva. As emblematic of the sun, and placed between the celestial signs Aries and Taurus, which these ram-headed and bull-headed figures represent, Mah\u0101deva may designate the position of the sun in the Zodiac when these sculptures were executed. I shall leave to others the task of calculating the precession of the equinoxes,\n\n* Vide \"Ruins of Empires.\"\n\u2020 In this word we should find the origin of the Persian crest, the Lion and Sun; Bil being the type of the sun, as in B\u0101lbec (the sun-idol) of Syria, and C\u00e9sar a lion.\nso as to elicit the period, if such is meant to be designated. Volney says, the vernal equinox coincided with the first degree of Aries 2504 years, and with the first degree of Taurus 4619 years, before Christ.\n\nThe Egyptians supposed the Sun to assume the forms of the animals represented in the zodiac; and such is not improbably the origin of the Hind\u00fa Avatars,* an idea supported by Volney, who says: \"The eagle of Vishn\u00fa is but one of the thousand emblems of the sun, and his incarnations in a fish, boar, lion, and turtle, nothing more than the metamorphosis of the same star, which, passing successively through the signs of the twelve animals, was supposed to assume these forms.\"\n\nWe will now quit this speculation and proceed to the legend of the sacrifice of S\u00e1ti and metamorphosis of Dacsha. I give it on the authority of Chand, the last of the great bards of India, who has incorporated numerous episodes from ancient mythologies.\n\nDacsha Prajapati\u2020 was a prince of the Satya Yuga: his daughter S\u00e1ti was married to Mah\u00e1d\u00e9va, who having offended his father-in-law, he chose to omit inviting him to attend a grand sacrifice, at which all the gods and demons (Dyte) were present. S\u00e1ti, from the summit of Kail\u00e1s beholding the assemblage, requested permission to repair thither. Siva (Mah\u00e1d\u00e9va) expostulated on the indelicacy of proceeding to her father's abode uninvited; but yielded to her earnest desire, giving her his own charger Nanda (Taurus), on which she joined the assembly. But her family paid the consort of Siva no attention, and portions of the sacred food were placed before the whole, absent and present, excepting only her lord. Anger so excited the faithful S\u00e1ti at this disrespect to Siva, that fire issued from her body, and she was consumed in the self-created flame.\u00a7 The infuriated Nanda destroyed the sacrifice, and returning to Kail\u00e1s, related to Mah\u00e1d\u00e9va the death of his spouse. In affliction Mah\u00e1d\u00e9va cut off his lock\u00a7 (jut'ha) and threw it on the earth, from which the giant Vira-Bhadra was born, who revenged the death of S\u00e1ti by the decollation of Dacsha. The gods and demons who had assembled to partake of the hospitable rites, implored of Mah\u00e1d\u00e9va|| that\n\n* It may be objected to this, that there are not so many Avatars as zodiacal signs.\n\u2020 Praja-pa'ti, lord of creatures.\n\u2021 This is the origin of the immolation of females, and of the term sati (vulg. suttee).\n\u00a7 In all ages, cutting off the lock appears to have been a sign of grief.\n|| Here we see the junction of the powers of life and death.\nhe would restore Dacsha to life. The father of the gods cut off the head of a goat, which he placed on the headless body of Dacsha, who instantly started up and began to bleat like a goat, at which Mahadeva was delighted and laughed immoderately; commanding, to commemorate the event, that his votaries should bleat like a goat.*\n\nIn this legend we have all the characters necessary to explain these two fragments of antique sculpture; Mahadeva, the tauriform Nanda, and the goat-headed Dacsha. The bird which Mahadeva feeds out of his cup,\u2020 formed of a human skull, is probably the Sarus,\u2021 sacred to him, and emblematic of conjugal affection,\u2014consequently alluding to the recent sacrifice of Sati.\n\nIn the compartment representing Vira-Bhadra, where a naked female figure is in the distance, we probably have allusion to the regeneration of the faithful Sati (a story precisely the counterpart of that of Atys and Cybele), who again appeared, and was wedded to Siva, as the fascinating mountain-nymph Mera, daughter of Hemachil.\n\nThis curious fable of the origin of the Hindu Pan, or Dacsha Prajapati, has considerable affinity to the Priapus of the Greeks and Romans, even in name, and still more to what Herodotus relates of the Theban Jupiter, to whom throughout the Mendesian territory goats were sacred, and sheep sacrificed; and it will strike the Orientalist as a singular coincidence, that the word (mendes) from which this Egyptian Jupiter was designated (from rams being offered to him) should be Sanscrit, in which language mend\u00e1 is ram. Herodotus thus explains its origin:\u00a7 \"Jupiter cut off the head of a ram, and covering himself with the skin, shewed him-\n\n* This is accordingly done, the cheeks are inflated, and beaten by the hands (g\u00e1l bajaona) to resemble the bleating of a goat.\n\n\u2020 Termed in the dialects cupra, and with which, as the God of war (Hur), he drinks the blood of the slain, in which he is exactly the Scandinavian Thor.\n\n\u2021 The Phenicopteros. These birds are always in pairs, and afford continual metaphors to the Hindu poet when describing domestic affection.\n\n\u00a7 Herodotus says, Mendes is alike the name of Pan and a Goat. M\u00e9nd\u00e1 is a ram in Sanscrit, and the ram-headed divinity in the caves of Ellora is termed M\u00e9n\u1e0d-\u015bwara, or Ram-God. The statue of Priapus was degraded into the scare-crow Terminus, as a land-mark, or territorial boundary, by the Romans. In Rajp\u00fatana we have the ass depicted on boundary-stones; and the gadha-yh\u00e1l to whosoever removes the land-mark, has a penal allusion, probably equally obscene with that of the god Terminus, of the Romans.\nself in that form to Hercules. Hence the Egyptians represent the statue of Jupiter with the head of a ram; and in the annual festival they kill a ram, and placing its skin on the image of the god, they introduce before it a figure of Hercules: the assembly afterwards beat the ram.\"\u2014Euterpe. 42.\n\nChand the bard introduces the birth of V\u00edra-Bhadra from the lock of Siva's hair, quite incidentally, but with great poetic skill; and as it affords, at the same time, an historic record of some moment, I may be excused introducing it to enliven a dull mythological speculation.\n\nTo the last great struggle which the Hindu emperor of Dehli maintained against the arms of Isl\u00e1m, we owe this legend. The Chohan king Prithi-R\u00e1ja preparing to repel the invasion of Shahbud\u00edn, assembles all his forces at the Chog\u00e1n or champ de Mars, on a plain beyond the walls of the capital, where he takes a muster of his vassals. The ceremony is converted into a day of rejoicing, on the emperor having released from confinement, at the desire of his brother-in-law Samarsi of Chitore, a celebrated leader called Chaond-ra\u00e9, who is distinguished both by the Hindu and Mahomedan writers for his conspicuous gallantry in the grand and final battle fought for Rajp\u00fat independence on the banks of the Caggar.\n\nChaond-ra\u00e9 Dahima was lord of Biana, which house produced three of the one hundred and eight great vassal chiefs or Samants of Prithi-Raja. Besides the honours his gallantry had obtained him for the reduction of Tutta and Bamanw\u00e1si in the valley of the Indus, his consequence was increased by the heir-apparent of Dehli, prince Rainasi, being his sister's child. But all his services were forgotten on his putting to death Har-s\u00e9n-g\u00e1r,* the favourite elephant of his sovereign, and though the act was in self-defence, his limbs were dishonoured with fetters: a proceeding which, with other follies consequent to the enl\u00e8vement of the princess of Canouj, had very nearly produced the deposal of Prithi-Raja, which proposition was formally discussed in a convention of the chief citizens of Dehli, in which even the speeches of the leading men are preserved by the Bard. The conciliation and liberation of Chaond-ra\u00e9 prevented this, and the elevation of Rainasi.\n\nThe Bard describes the chivalry of the Chohan performing their evolutions, while the instruments of music, the martial Ndk\u00e1r\u00e1s and trumpets made the welkin ring: but in the midst of this clangor and mutual greeting,\n\n* 'The ornament of Hari.'\nthe imperial band, which was placed on a mass of rock over a cavern, was disconcerted by a tremulous motion of the rock, followed by its dislocation and their precipitation into the cavern. All assembled round the cave, indulging in speculation on the cause; which, while one attributed it to an earthquake, and another \"to the writhing of Seh\u00e9snaga,\"* a third discovered in a huge monster lying in a state of torpor. Afraid to approach, they entangled him in coils of rope, and dragged him to light; when, having at length succeeded in awakening him, they desire the prophetic Bard (Chand Tr\u00ed-c\u00e1la) to interrogate him, and after a description of the giant which casts into shade all that was ever written on these sons of C\u00e6lus and Terra,+ the following dialogue ensues.\n\nChand.\u2014\"Who art thou? whence, and who thy parents? why make this thy dwelling place?\"\n\n\"When at the sacrifice of Dachsa Prajapati, S\u00e1ti was consumed in the self-kindled flame and Nanda destroyed the sacrifice, dread seized the three worlds; Kailas \u2020 shook, Kampila trembled; Gods, demons, and men were struck with affright at the work of destruction caused by the infuriate Nanda. At the loss of S\u00e1ti, M\u0101had\u00e9va cut off his jut'ha and threw it on the earth. From this lock (jut'ha) I had my birth. My name Vira-Bhadra, my father\u00a7 Tr\u00edpur\u00e1ri. In the Satya-yuga I was called Sancara; in the Tr\u00e9tu-yuga, B\u00e1l; in the Dw\u00e1para-yuga, Sehl, when I fostered mankind and religion. Then contented I reposed in Yoginip\u00fara; and now in the K\u00e1l-y\u00faga, my name is K\u00e1l (Time). My repose has been disturbed by the uproar of mortals. What has caused the din?\"\n\nChand.\u2014\"Oh mighty lord, such a tumult has not been heard since Indra fought Bret\u00e1s\u00far\u00e1, or since R\u00e1ma destroyed the abode of Ravana: such a din has not been heard since the battle of the Pand\u00fas, or when Jarasand'ha met the Yadavas in fight. This din is raised by the Samants of Dehli assembled to oppose the King of the north, and rejoicing for the release of the D\u00e1him\u00e1, Chaond-ra\u00e9.\"\n\n---\n\n* The serpent which supports the globe on its head.\n\n\u2020 Scripture terms the giants, Zumzum\u00edn; to which a mixed Sanscrit and Persian etymology could be given, in Jenem, birth, and Zum\u00edn, earth.\n\n\u2021 Jupiter Olympus (Kailas), and Terra, are thus made the parents of the Dytes (Titans).\n\n\u00a7 My father (Taut'h)\u2014, the universal father; probably the Toth of the Egyptians, and the Teutates of the German races.\u2014Buddha, father of the lunar race, is likewise Taut'h.\nTime is indignant at being awoken from the repose of ages, by so inadequate a cause as the approaching struggle for the empire of Hindusthan, between the Chohans and the Ghoriens, and treats the bard of Bhavani with but little respect. He gives vent to his indignation in the measure of verse called a C\u00e1vita.\n\n\"These are but mortals; the Gods engaged in fight have I beheld. Between Serindra and Tarika I saw the combat: in the war of Lanka I was present: in that of Magad-d\u00e9sa, in the time of Mandhata: that of the lofty Duryodhana and Arjuna I witnessed. O Bard of the double-tongue, these were battles!\"\n\nChand.\u2014\"You are a God; in the combats of Gods and Titans (Dyte) you have mingled, but those of the high-minded warriors of the Chohan are also worth beholding. When their arms ply in fight the foe survives not; their heads as they fall exclaim havac, the standing trunk tranching the air, and from the blood fresh warriors rise and renew the fight. Do you, oh V\u00edra, accompany our warriors, and with them dance a moment in the red field of slaughter. The war of Gods and Demons, even that of the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata of old, was not more glorious than this; nor amongst them all was there the equal of the son of Somesa.\"\n\n\"V\u00edra-Bhadra smiled on the bard as he said 'The battles I have seen with the mighty swords of old, awoke from his meditations the father of creation: nay, the chaplet dropped from his hands. Such were they, that the strong in heart wished for distance. Oh mortal, let thy words resemble thy condition, and talk not as though thou wert exalted as myself. I saw Sri Crishna in the fight with Duryodhana. Even of his immortality I had doubts; but thy words are incredible as if thou hadst said S\u00fam\u00e9ru had been moved. These eyes beheld the war between Kali and the Demons: the deeds of these mortals I regard as a dream.'\"\n\n\"V\u00edra Bhadra became warm: his eyes glared with rage. Oh bard insignificant, lower your speech. To awake me to see your conflict! the heroes of Duryodhana alone dared to do this!\" As he spoke volcanic flames issued from his throat; the three worlds shook. \"No battle equalled that of Duryodhana; nor would I term what mortals can perform a battle. Mimic not, therefore, your superiors; but from my mouth listen to the fight of Duryodhana.\"\n\nV\u00edra-Bhadra (or Time) proceeds to relate to the Prophetic Seer Tri-c\u00e1l the events of the great international war amongst the Y\u00e1davas, which forms\none of the many beautiful episodes of the Rajp\u00fat Homer, extracted from the ancient historical poems of the martial races, as the Mah\u00e1dbh\u00e1r\u00e1t, R\u00e1m\u00e1-y\u00fana, &c. &c. As I have already given the passage in a paper printed in the Transactions of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique of Paris, I shall refer the reader to it.*\n\nV\u00edra-Bhadra having related the grand battle between the C\u00farus and P\u00e1nd\u00fas, in turn listens to Chand, who entertains him with a biographical sketch of all the great leaders (S\u00e1mantas) assembled in the cause of Rajp\u00fat independence, and at the same time gives V\u00edra-Bhadra a specimen of the prophetic power which gave him the title of Tri-c\u00e1l, or 'cognoscent of the past, present, and future,' by revealing the events which were to follow that battle, in which he was overheard by his sovereign Prithi-raja. A grand council ensues, in which the plan of the campaign is debated, when each chieftain delivers his sentiments in an oration. Chand concludes with an invocation to Time (Kal).\n\n3d. Jayad-rat'ha.\n\nOn this Charioteer, or chariot of Victory, represented by Siva, I have nothing to say. Siva, it is suggested, has borrowed the car of Surya (the Sun) to bear him to battle; but if this were the intent, where is Sapt\u00e1sw\u00e1, the seven-headed horse of the Sun?\n\n4th. Bhairava.\n\nBhairava, or Bhyr\u00fa, has an important part assigned to him in the dramatis personae of the field of battle, on which occasion he represents the god of war. The rites of Bhairava are accordingly of a terrific description, nor can he be propitiated but by blood-offerings. There are two Bhairavas, Gor\u00e1 and K\u00e1l\u00e1, or the fair and black. They are the twin sons of the terrific goddess K\u00e1l\u00edca, the Cybele of the Rajp\u00fats, and are her standard-bearers in the field of slaughter. Gor\u00e1, or the fair Bhairava, is seldom mentioned, and the devotions of the Rajp\u00fat are generally to his sable brother, who is also called Bajranga, or of thunder-bolt frame. The dog, which is probably the only animal excluded from the honours of deification in the crowded pantheon of the Hind\u00fas, is sacred to Bhairava, and is his\n\n* See article \"De l'origine Asiatique de quelques-unes des anciennes Tribus de l'Europe \u00e9tablies sur les rivages de la mer Baltique,\" &c. &c. Journal Asiatique, No. 50, Mai 1827.\ncompanion in the field of battle;* and he is sculptured riding on a dog, with the martial horn called Napairi in one hand, and the Damru, or small drum, with which he incites the courage of the combatants, in the other. The standard of this the elder son of the god of battle, is often described by the bard as being \"of the colour of the rain-cloud,\" or a field sable, on which a white horse passant is delineated.\n\nOn a former occasion,\u2020 I gave from the great bard of the martial Rajputs, a slight sketch of the machinery of a field of battle, in which Chand, like Homer, brings the celestials to view, and often to mix with the fight. But Chand's mythology takes a wider range than Homer's, and we must have recourse to the Scald of Scandinavia for a parallel to much of his imagery; forthough Chand makes Kailasa shake, as Homer did Olympus with the anger of Jivapitri, the Greek was too refined to make the father of the gods quaff blood from the skull-cup, the patera (\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd) of Siva or Hari; for whose counterpart we must have reference to the Thor of the Northman, as well as for the sisters of our Apsaras and Palcharas, the Valkyries\u2021 of northern mythology.\n\nIn every field of battle, either Siva, or his consort, the terrific Mata, leads the war. She is on her lion, armed with the trident, preceded by her standard-bearing sons, the Bhairavas, and followed by \"the fatal sisters\" the sixty-four Yoginis, with clouds of inferior powers all of female personification, and each holding a patera of the skull. Another extract from Chand may better illustrate this, taken from one of the most interesting of the sixty-nine cantos of the bard, entitled \"the Battle of Canouj, or the Vow of Sunjogta.\"\u00a7 I select a passage to shew that the bards of the Rajputs, like those of Scandinavia, incited the warriors to deeds of glory by their example as well as by their poesy.\n\n* The battle shouts of the Rajput warrior are \"Hari-Hari (the common epithet of Siva as god of war),\" and \"havac, havac.\" We might suppose the \"immortal bard\" had been reading Chand, the Homer of the Rajputs, when he exclaims\n\n\"Cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war.\"\n\nHavoc is from the Cimbric or Welsh \"hafog,\" meaning slaughter.\n\n\u2020 See Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society, vol. i, p. 151.\n\n\u2021 See Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society, vol. i, p. 150.\n\n\u00a7 If these and the preceding extracts from the bard Chand should excite an interest in the Society, it would be an inducement to me to give a few cantos, preceded by a biographical introduction on the life of his hero, the last emperor of the Hind\u00fas, as papers for the Transactions of the Society.\nThe Chohan prince of Dehli had carried off the Princess of Canouj. Her father, Jychund, at the head of all his forces, pursues, and the period of time when the bard Chand engages is on the fourth day's fight, when they had almost reached the ferry of the Ganges. By this time Prithi-Raja had lost nearly three-fourths of his heroes, and he is about placing his bride, Sunjogta (who had hitherto remained on the same horse with himself), on a separate steed. Although night, there was no cessation of the fight, during the retreat from Canouj to Dehli.\n\n\"Night came: the beam of moon arose. The lord of men descended from his steed, and placed Sunjogta on another. The blood-stained arrows fly: one pierced the casque of the Chohan. Then did the bard demand to wield the sword; but his prince exclaimed, 'Strong are our swords, oh bard, leave thou the fight, that we may live in song.'\u2014'To sing your renown, oh lord, I leave Julhun, my son: for me, I make offering of my head to Mahadeo.'\n\n\"As he spoke he gave his steed the rein: on his countenance shone the light of honour. The Indra of song dashed into the throng of fight, like the moon* athwart the constellations. His steed Keshore, the gift of his lord, fit to be yoked to the chariot of the sun, of the blood of Irak,\u2020 like a wave of the sea, his ear the lance's point, his eye soft as that of the fair, his mane like the rippling wave: from the bucklers of the slain his hoof struck fire as he bore the bard to battle. Where'er his sword fell, the Yoginis filled their cups with the blood of the northmen. The gods shouted applause. Covered with wounds was Keshore, but the mountain-born\u2021 preserved her worshipping. The Apsaras sung his praise, the Palcharas\u00a7 feasted in the track of his sword. Applause|| to the bard! He rejoined his lord on foot; his steed lay in the field.\n\n* Here we lose the force of the original, for Chand (the Bard) compares the rapidity of his own movements to those of Chandra (the moon) passing over the constellations: one of the many jeux de mots in which our poet indulges.\n\n\u2020 A Persian province renowned for its breed of horses.\n\n\u2021 Parvati, one of the names of the Indian Minerva.\n\n\u00a7 Palchara is from pala 'flesh,' and charna 'to feed on.' The Valkyrie of Scandinavian mythology, is a being between the Apsara and Palchara; neither so ethereal as the first, nor so material as the latter.\n\n|| The warlike bards of Iud, like the Scalds and poetic heroes of Scandinavia, possessed none of the false shame which prevented their lauding themselves on fit occasion. Chand is a conspicuous example of this, never omitting an opportunity of eulogizing his own valour.\n\"The battle raged. Steel met steel; the mace resounds on the helm; the heroes are inebriated with the war-song; bucklers are broken in pieces. The gods convene above. Never, say they, such deeds did mortals perform: they fight on mountains of slain, o'er whose sides descend rivers of blood.\n\n\"Then did Uttitai seize his trident. The Yoginis in his train, he rushed into the field. Each held the patera to drink the blood of the slain. Mahadeo followed his favourite to obtain a gem for his necklace.* In the lake of battle Uttitai cut down the lotus; his trident broke the dam which kept in its waters. Mahadeo filled his chaplet: the Devis glutted with blood. Jesswunt Rahtore bowed to his lord as he opposed the hero; but with a laugh Uttitai threw his head at the feet of Mahadeo. Once more the Mirs of the north \u2020 engaged; fresh heroes of Canouj replaced the slain. Rembha and the heavenly fair descended. Uttitai was their choice, but the Urvdis\u2021 quarrelled for the hero: they agreed to share him amongst them. Thrice the hero broke the circle of fight. When the war-shell reached his ear, his head touched heaven: the host of Canouj fled before him; the Yoginis exclaimed, 'Victory to Uttitai!' while each host called aloud, 'Renown to the lord of the trident!' The Apsaras hovered o'er the hero, each eagerly struggled; but nor Rembha nor Apsara was destined; Gunga\u00a7 herself received her son in her embrace: the wave closed o'er the form of Uttitai.\n\n\"The Gandarva|| took flight for the regions above: to the god of the\n\nThe Edda affords many specimens of the same character.

Essay on the Life and Writings of Ferishta. By Lieut.-Colonel John Briggs, M.R.A.S.\n\nRead January 17, 1829.\n\nDuring our last session I did myself the pleasure of presenting to the Society an autobiographical sketch of Nana Farnevis; and of elucidating the character of Madhu Rao the Great, the prince of Poona, from a series of original letters, principally in his own handwriting.\n\nThe interest which those papers excited fully proves, that the biography of celebrated men is an object not only deserving your attention, but, I may venture to say, is also one of the most pleasing forms in which information regarding the inhabitants of the East can well be conveyed to the learned of the West. It is this conviction that has induced me to submit to you the following sketch of the life of the great Muhammedan historian of India, commonly known by the name of Ferishta, with some account of his writings; and I feel assured that your attention will be more completely roused, when you know that his work, now lying before me, has lately been translated, and will in a few days, I trust, be open to your inspection, and submitted for your judgment and approval.*\n\nThe singular modesty of this eminent individual, proofs of which I shall have an opportunity of laying before you, prevented him from leaving any specific account of himself; but his anxiety to authenticate facts, and to verify his narrative, has frequently induced him to introduce his name, whenever he was an eye-witness; and from these observations we gather sufficient information to enable us to form a tolerably exact idea of his circumstances, of the advantages he possessed as an historian, and of the qualities he brought with him to complete his valuable work.\n\nMuhamed Kasim, the son of Gholam Ali Hindu Shah, is the real name of the person entitled Ferishta. He was born at Astrabad on the shores of the Caspian sea; and at the age of twelve he left his native country, in company with his father, on their journey to India. He must have reached Ahmudnuggur in the Deccan, the seat of the Nizam Shahi kings, about the\n\n* The work here alluded to has since been published by Col. Briggs, under the title of an \"History of the Rise of the Muhammedan Power in India.\"\nyear A.D. 1582; and shortly after, his father Gholam Ali being appointed private tutor to the prince Miran Hussein, Ferishta and the prince were brought up together as schoolfellows. The tutor's son grew in great favour with the king; and on the death of the father he received a commission in the royal guard. It is in this capacity we first become acquainted with him, in his public character; and as the narrative of the event which led to his patron's death, and his own departure from Ahmudnuggur, is extremely interesting, I shall give the account of the revolution that took place nearly in his own words.\n\nMurteza Nizam Shah, the king of whom I am about to speak, was commonly called Diwana, or the madman; and the historian offers so many proofs of his title to that appellation, that we cannot doubt its justice. After giving several instances of his insanity, Ferishta states, \"the king now took it into his head that his son wished to dethrone him, and he in consequence resolved to put the prince to death; but the minister Sula-but Khan always contrived to screen him.\" At length the king, defeated in all his attempts, removed the minister from his office, caused him to be imprisoned, and appointed another. Not long after this, the king went into his son's apartment while asleep, locked the door, and set fire to the chamber. The prince contrived to escape out of the window, and fled to Dowlutabad. Mirza Khan, the new minister, perceiving the distracted state of the king's mind, only waited for some pretence to raise troops and dethrone him. He in consequence wrote to Ibrahim Adil Shah, the king of Bijapur, and urged him to march an army to the frontier. This object being attained, the minister proceeded to oppose the mock invasion; but halted at Ranury, a town within a few miles of the capital. Ferishta observes, \"The king, surprised that the army did not move forward, sent me to inquire the cause. As the minister knew my attachment to the king, and concluded that if I discovered his designs I should make them known, he bribed the court favourite, Futteh Shah, to obtain the recal of the army. I was in the camp when Futteh Shah arrived, and as the minister saw that I penetrated his design, he gave orders to prevent my return. Having, however, obtained intimation of his intention to detain me, I made my escape during the night. On my arrival in the city, I related what I had seen and heard to Futteh Shah, who pretended not to believe me. I remarked that I had no interest or hatred to gratify, which might induce me to accuse the minister falsely; and that the truth of my account would\nsoon appear. While we were talking, intelligence was brought that the minister, Mirza Khan, had marched to Dowlutabad, in order to bring the prince Miran Hussein, and to seat him on the throne. The king now asked my advice how to avert the threatened storm. I replied, that there were two measures which occurred to me: first, that the king should leave his retirement, and march from the city at the head of his guards; when, probably, most of the nobles would desert the minister and join him: to which he replied, he was too ill to mount a horse. Secondly, that he should send for Salabut Khan from confinement, and put him at the head of affairs; as he was beloved and respected by all ranks, who would flock to his standard: and his Majesty might proceed in a litter to meet him as far as the fort of Junir. The king, approving of this advice, instantly sent off orders to release Salabut Khan, and prepared to move himself; when Futteh Shah fell at his feet, and weeping said, that should his Majesty quit the palace, the guards would immediately seize him, and send him prisoner to the prince, in order to pay their court to a new sovereign. On this the king altered his intention; and resolved to wait in the palace for the arrival of Salabut Khan. The troops, perceiving the king's imbecility, deserted in crowds to Dowlatabad; from which place Mirza Khan hastened to the capital, accompanied by the prince, and arrived before Salabut Khan. At the time he came I had the guard of the palace, and wished to defend it; but being deserted by my people, and no one being left with the king but Futteh Shah and a very few domestic attendants, opposition was vain. The prince and Mirza Khan rushed into the fort, followed by the whole army consisting of 40,000 armed men, and put to death without mercy whomsoever they found. The prince fortunately recognized me; and reflecting that we had been schoolfellows and brought up together, ordered my life to be spared. Having reached his father's presence, the prince treated him, both in word and action, with every possible degree of insult. Murteza Nizam Shah was silent, and only looked at him with contempt; till the prince, drawing his naked sabre across his breast, said, \"I will put you to death.\" Murteza Nizam Shah then breathing a deep sigh, exclaimed, \"O thou accursed of God! it were better for thee to let thy father be thy guest for his few remaining days, and treat him with respect.\" The prince relenting for a moment at this speech, withdrew from the apartment. Not having patience, however, to wait for his death, though he was then ill of a mortal disease, he caused the king to be shut into a warm-bath room; and closing fast the\ndoors and windows, so as to exclude all air, he lighted a great fire underneath, and the king was speedily suffocated. This parricide was perpetrated in the year 996 (A.D. 1588). The deceased was buried with due ceremony in the royal gardens; but his bones were afterwards taken up, and conveyed to Kerbela; where they were deposited near those of his father and grandfather. Murteza Nizam Shah reigned twenty-four years and some months.\"\n\nThis revolution compelled Ferishta to quit Ahmudnuggur; and he went direct to Bijapur, the capital of the Adil Shahi kings; where he arrived in the year 1589, and was favourably received by the young king Ibrahim Adil Shah, then a minor under the tutelage of his ambitious and able minister Dilawer Khan. Not long after his arrival the parricide M\u012bran Hussein Nizam Shah was put to death by a faction at Ahmudnuggur; and one Jumal Khan, assuming the character of a saint, usurped the control of the government. The intimate family connexion which subsisted between the kings of Bijapur and Ahmudnugger warranted the interference of the former state, and a war ensued. The young king of Bijapur was advised by some of his officers to delay an action till the arrival of a body of troops, which was expected from the north. The regent Dilawer Khan, regardless of the king's wishes, went into battle, but was deserted by several officers who had dissuaded the king from engaging the enemy. He was defeated; and, after a gallant struggle, was compelled to quit the field, with only seven persons in his train, among whom was Ferishta himself; who shortly after sunk from loss of blood, owing to the wounds he had received, and fell into the enemy's hands. Dilawer Khan, taking the king with him, retreated thirty miles during the night. The army from the north approaching at this time, the enemy marched to meet it, and this movement enabled Ferishta to escape: in a few days he rejoined the king of Bijapur's army. Dissentions now ran so high between that prince and the Regent, that the former resolved to make an effort to establish his authority. Ferishta states, \"As all the officers of the royal household and the body guards were attached to Dilawer Khan, the king was fearful of communicating his wishes to them, lest they should betray him. After much precaution, he fixed upon two Hindus, common servants of no note, to be his confidants on this important occasion. These he sent privately to Ein-ul-Mulk, the Amir-ul-Omra,* to complain of\n\n* Chief of the nobles.\nthe unreasonable conduct of Dilawer Khan; and received in reply solemn assurances of support and assistance. After much negociation, conducted through the two Hindus, it was agreed that the king should, on a certain night when Dilawer Khan was asleep, repair suddenly to the camp of Ein-ul-Mulk, which was only a mile distant, where he was to be joined by him, by Alum Khan, and by Akus Khan, who all swore faithfully to obey his commands. Ibrahim Adil Shah, relying on these promises, on the night of the 14th Rujeb 998 (8th May 1590), came out of his private apartments, and commanded Kufshdar Khan to bring him a horse. The keeper of the stables refused obedience, saying, that he dared not comply without the orders of Dilawer Khan. Kufshdar Khan, provoked at his insolence, gave him several blows; upon which the grooms of the stable became terrified, and brought horses immediately. The king mounted, and issued forth from his tents attended by his servants. On the way Elias Khan, his nurse's son, who was upon guard, ran up to him, asked the cause of this movement, and received for answer, 'that the present was not a time for explanation; but he should know if he chose to follow him:' which he immediately did, and brought with him something less than a hundred horse. When he arrived within a short distance of the camp of Ein-ul-Mulk, he halted, till that nobleman with Alum Khan and Akus Khan joined him. As soon as the king's march became known, several officers, among whom was myself, with about three thousand soldiers, hastened to join him during the night. Dilawer Khan gained no intelligence of the King's flight till morning; for his attendants had received the strictest orders not to disturb him: a circumstance which gave full time for Ibrahim Adil Shah to complete his design. Towards sunrise, the minister being aroused, proceeded with his sons and six thousand horse, besides a number of elephants, and followed his sovereign, in hopes that on his arrival the king would be deserted by his friends, and be again obliged to throw himself into his hands. When Dilawer Khan came in sight of the royal army, the king ordered Ein-ul-Mulk to prepare to oppose him; but that nobleman sent word privately to the minister, offering to stand neuter while the other should attempt to carry off the king. Dilawer Khan, encouraged by this assurance, stopped his followers at a little distance, and coming on with a hundred horse and four elephants close to the king, addressed him, saying, 'that marching at night was extremely improper; and that he hoped the king would now return to his encampment.'\nIbrahim, enraged at this insolence, exclaimed, 'Will no one punish this traitor?' Upon which an inferior officer of the body guard, named Ad\u012bna Khan, spurred his horse up to Dilawer Khan, gave him a wound with his sabre, and was preparing to inflict another, when the minister's horse rearing at the flashing of the weapon, threw him; and some of his elephant drivers urging their elephants between him and Adina Khan, gave him time to escape to his own troops, whom he endeavoured to lead on against the king; but they hesitated to assault their sovereign, and many of them even deserted to him. Dilawer Khan, overwhelmed with confusion, effected his escape to Ahmudnuggur; but his son Kumal Khan was overtaken at Darasun by the royalists and put to death.\"\n\nIn continuation of the life of Ferishta, we may mention that he attended the Princess Begum Sultana, the daughter of Ibrahim Adil Shah II., from Bijapur to Moongi Peitun, in the year A.D. 1604, and was present at her nuptials with the prince Daniel, the son of Akber. In the year 1606, he proceeded as ambassador to the court of Jehangir, which he overtook at Lahore, on its route to Kashmeer. The object of this embassy is not known; but it seems probable that it was a mere mission of condolence on account of his father's death, and of congratulation on the prince's accession to the throne of the most powerful empire of the East.\n\nAt a very early period of life, Ferishta conceived the idea of writing the work which he has left to posterity, as appears from his preface; which is so full of simplicity and modesty, that I shall give it in his own words.\n\n\"Muhamed Kasim Hindu Shah, the most humble subject of this realm, begs to state to the learned, that in his youthful days he was early inspired with a desire of compiling a history of the conquests of Islam in Hind, and of giving some account of the holy personages who have flourished in that country; but being unable to procure the materials necessary for such a work at Ahmudnuggur, where he then resided, his wish still remained to be fulfilled; when in the year 998 (A.D. 1589) he proceeded from that city to Bijapur, and was introduced to the prince who was then seated on the throne of the latter kingdom. That monarch devoted much of his time to the study of history, and frequently heaped favours on this author, urging him to complete the object which had ever been uppermost in his mind.\n\n\"In order to effect this end, he was directed to obtain historical works from all quarters; and in a short time a vast collection of materials was\nbrought together and minutely examined. Of these not one work contained the information which was required; for though the history of Nizam-ud-Deen Ahmad Bukhshi embraces a great portion of the period alluded to, yet it was found so defective in some parts, that the author was capable of supplying many of the deficiencies from his personal knowledge alone. The desire, therefore, of becoming the historian of the rise of the Muhammedan power in India more and more filled the writer's mind, and he in consequence began to arrange his materials. And having, in the due course of time, brought his task to a close, he presented this work, in the year of the Hijra 1018 (A.D. 1609), under the title of 'The History of Ferishta,' to his revered monarch, to whom his labours are thus humbly dedicated.\n\n\"As the author conceives it would be highly unbecoming in him to make comments on those writers who have before touched on the same subject, and who have drawn their mantles over their heads and sunk into the slumber of the tomb, he places the finger of silence on his lips, and is dumb as to their imperfections. He leaves his readers to judge of his own performance for themselves; begging them to understand that the height of his ambition amounts only to the desire, that his work may rank in comparison with theirs, 'as the Caaba at Mecca does with the holy temple at Jerusalem,' and 'as Ali ranks with the prophet Muhammed.'\n\n\"The author's fervent hope is, that these simple and unadorned annals, founded on truth, but devoid of all pretensions to elegance of style or beauty of composition, may be acceptable to the prince to whom they are dedicated; and that the contents of these volumes may be disseminated far and wide over the regions of the earth.\"\n\nIn the compilation of this history the following works were consulted:\n\n1.

His style, as he truly observes, is for the most part simple, and is devoid of that redundancy and richness of imagery which so peculiarly distinguishes the Persian language. Perhaps sufficient proofs of this have been exhibited in the extracts already given; but there is a desire of adhering to truth, and of maintaining a character for honest independence pervading his work, which is truly admirable. As it was notorious that he wrote his history under the patronage of Ibrahim Adil Shah II., in whose service it has been shewn that he bled as a soldier at the early age of nineteen or twenty; by whom he was selected for the honourable office of escorting his daughter on her progress to be married at a foreign court; and by whom he was appointed ambassador to the Great Mogul; Ferishta conceived that these marks of favour from his prince might be supposed to influence him in writing the history of his own times. To the commencement of that of the kings of Bijapur he therefore conceives it incumbent on him to affix the following preface.\n\n\"This humble individual wishes it to be known to those reflecting persons who read his work, that as the object of his labours, in the former volumes, has been to give an account of the sovereigns of Dehli, and the Bahmuny kings of the Deccan; so his care in the two remaining ones will be, to write a detail of the histories of all the other Muhamedan princes who have held independent sway in the different provinces of India: and he proposes to begin this part of the work with an account of the illustrious sovereigns who have reigned in Bijapur; for whose prosperity and perpetual welfare he prays to Almighty God. Placed as the author is under the protection of this family, it might be supposed that he would lavish fulsome encomiums on its ancestors, and misrepresent facts, for the purpose of obtaining pecuniary rewards; but his object is to write truth, and to render his narrative clear, in simple and unadorned language. He has fortunately been already placed, by the bounty of his gracious sovereign, Ibrahim Adil Shah II., above pecuniary desires, and he tramples gold underneath his feet. He has nothing more on that score to wish for; so that he is at liberty to follow\nhis own inclination, as well as to fulfil the commands of his king, in performing the task which has been assigned to him.\"\n\nHow far he maintained his independence I shall proceed to shew by one more extract from his works. It has been before related how the regent, Dilawer Khan, was defeated by the energy of the young king, who thus became uncontrolled master of his own actions. The regent fled to Ahmudnuggur, and induced the king of that state to wage war against Ibrahim; who, finding he had a difficult task to perform in warding off this attack upon his dominions, resolved to attempt that by stratagem which he was unequal to effect by force. The following is the account in Ferishta's own words. \"Ibrahim Adil Shah at length finding matters ripe for the execution of his design, sent a messenger to Dilawer Khan, requesting him to return and again take charge of his affairs; observing, that 'he saw, though late, the folly of his conduct, in having listened to the representations of designing men against so worthy a servant: and added that, if he would once more accept of his office, he might depend on meeting with the utmost consideration.' Dilawer Khan, overjoyed at this invitation, returned for answer, that if his Majesty would assure him he should not suffer any injury in his life or property, he would hasten to throw himself at his feet. All the securities he required being granted, the minister, in hopes of once more obtaining absolute power, and establishing an influence over the king as formerly, obtained his dismissal from Burhan Nizam Shah, who in vain represented to him that he was hastening to his own destruction; observing, that such behaviour as his towards his sovereign could never be sincerely forgiven. The minister, disregarding this warning, came to Bijapur, where he arrived in the evening, as the king was returning from the garden of the twelve Imams to the palace. After having paid his respects, he followed on foot in the royal train. When he had proceeded a little way, the king called to Elias Khan, and ordered him to show Dilawer Khan a specimen of his own favourite punishment, in putting out eyes. The minister in vain represented that he had come to court on his Majesty's assurances of pardon and safety. The king told him that he had only promised not to injure his life or property, and that depriving him of sight would affect neither. His eyes were accordingly put out; and he himself was sent a prisoner to the fortress of Satara, where he remained till he died.\"\n\nOn this occasion Ferishta has indeed fulfilled the promise he made to the\nworld, that he would be influenced by no consideration of partiality to lavish unmerited encomium on the family of his prince. There may be some persons so fastidious as to condemn him for exposing, in the manner he has done, the treachery displayed, on the occasion just mentioned, by his friend and benefactor; but others will justify his conduct, by asserting that the fidelity of the historian predominated over friendship for the individual; and that the love of truth supported him in braving the indignation of an incensed master and an absolute despot. While we respect this admirable trait of Ferishta's character, I would not for a moment imagine that he had much cause for apprehension from the patron of literature, to whom we are mainly indebted for the work now before us; for I should be unwilling to believe that Ibrahim Adil Shah II., though guilty of revenge, and even of systematic deceit towards his greatest enemy, a traitor to his country, and who sought to subvert his kingdom, and, perhaps, to deprive himself of life, would be capable of so ignoble a deed as to punish the honest historian who dared to relate the acts of his reign with truth and impartiality.\n\nBefore I proceed to give an account of the history, it may be proper to make some observations on Ferishta's qualifications as an historian.\n\nThe circumstance of his being born on the shores of the Caspian bordering on Persia and on Chorasmia, or Transoxania, rendered him familiar in his youth with the Toorky and Persian languages; with the names of places, and of tribes; and with the peculiar habits of those northern races. His travels through Khorassan, Ghizni, and Peshawur into India, and his journeys throughout Hindoostan, afforded him great advantages in point of observation; and with a mind naturally delighting in historical narrative, it is not surprising that he should have early formed the design of compiling the work which he lived to complete. The scenes he describes in the north were acted on a field ever present to his youthful mind; and his lively imagination followed with enthusiasm the glorious marches of Mahmud of Ghizni; or accompanied Baber in all his romantic exploits in Transoxania. When we consider that Ferishta was at once a soldier, a statesman, and a scholar, associating all his life with princes and courtiers, that he had travelled over the greater part of the country in which the extensive scope of his history lies, and that he was an eye-witness to many of the events he describes, it must be acknowledged that he came to the task with advantages which few historians have possessed before him.\n\nIt is but right to observe, however, that the work has not always been\nequally well executed; a defect which is rather to be ascribed to the nature of his materials than to his own incapacity. The events of the early periods of the history are too much crowded together; and many trivial occurrences that serve to load the work, without adding to its perspicuity, might have been altogether omitted without detracting from its value. In the histories of the Deccan, Ferishta is full, clear, and entertaining; and his account of the Mogul empire is extremely well written; while the details of all the minor histories are instructive, and tend to elucidate the events of each other. All that Ferishta pretends to be is an annalist. He seldom indulges in philosophical remarks; but whenever he does, they are judicious and evince a strong mind. In many parts of the Deccan history he has traced the causes of great political events with an accuracy and perspicuity that do him infinite credit; and for fidelity, impartiality, and simplicity, Ferishta is, perhaps, entitled to rank higher than any historian of his country.*\n\nHaving said so much regarding the author, I will now draw a hasty outline of the work itself.\n\nIt is not easy, on account of the irregularity of its figure, to convey a correct idea of the superficial area, over the history of which Ferishta's great work extends; I shall leave it therefore to the imagination to fill up the outline from the following positions. On the extreme west is Hamadan, the ancient Ekbatana; and on the east Chittagong, situated near the Delta of the Ganges, at the head of the Bay of Bengal. On the north is Samarkand, or Marakanda, in Transoxania; while to the south it is terminated by the course of the Kishna river. These limits extend therefore from the 50th to the 95th degree of longitude east from Greenwich; and from the 14th to the 40th of northern latitude. The population of this vast tract may be roughly computed at one hundred and fifty millions. The period of the history embraces more than six hundred years, viz., from the year 997 of the Christian era to 1609.\n\n* In preparing for the press the translation which is shortly to appear, I have availed myself of my friend Colonel Tod's extensive knowledge of the history of the northern Hindoo nations; and it has been equally satisfactory to us both, to find how much the chain of events, related by the Muhamedan historian, derive confirmation from the heroic poems of the Hindoo bards, as well as from monumental pillars and tablets of copper and stone, copies of the inscriptions of which are in the possession of Colonel Tod; and, I am happy to say, are soon likely to meet the public eye, in the interesting and important 'Annals of Rajpootana,' in which he is at present engaged.\nTowards the end of the tenth century, one of the last of the Samanian dynasty of Muhamedan kings reigned over Transoxania, and held his court at Samarkand; about which period his lieutenant Subuktugee, taking advantage of the minority of his sovereign, declared himself independent, and laid the foundation of the kingdom of Ghizni. Subuktugee was the first Muhamedan sovereign who came into hostile contact with the princes of India. In the year 979, an indecisive battle was fought on the plains of Lurghau, to the west of the Indus. For twenty years after, peace was maintained with the Hindoos; while Subuktugee was occupied in strengthening an empire, then only in its infancy, but which was destined eventually to extend over all India. It will be instructive to examine the condition of Europe as we proceed in this historical sketch. Edmund Ironside filled the throne of England, and Robert I. that of France. Otho III. had just rendered the German empire elective; and Boleslaus, the first king of Poland, was about to ascend the throne. The arithmetical figures now in common use, had lately been introduced into the west by the Muhamedans; but paper had not yet been manufactured in Europe.\n\nIt was at this time that Mahmud, the son of Subuktugee, succeeded his father, in the year 998. His reign was one continued course of conquest and military glory. The historian of the \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\" observes, \"his kingdom was enlarged from Transoxania to the neighbourhood of Ispahan; from the shores of the Caspian to the mouths of the Indus. But the principal source of his fame and riches, was the holy war which he waged against the idolaters of India. In this foreign narrative,\" he observes, \"I may not consume a page; though a volume would scarcely suffice to recapitulate the battles and sieges of his twelve expeditions.\"\n\nOf these it may suffice to advert to two in particular: the first is the march of three successive months, which brought Mahmud within sight of Canouj; the second, the three years which were consumed in his celebrated expedition to Guzerat. It would be wrong to suppose that such campaigns were the mere burst of savage hordes, who, breaking forth on a sudden, devastate the country they occupy, and pass on to others. On the contrary, Ferishta has minutely described the measures taken to provide against the contingencies to which such military operations were liable. Supplies not only of grain and fodder for the use of the army were carried with it, but even of water on some occasions where deserts were to be passed; and the\nsystematic mode of combat, as well as the discipline observed, evince the state of perfection to which the military art had attained at that time in Asia. Nor was the reign of Mahmud of Ghizni famous alone for his military achievements: Firdousee, the greatest poet of his country, flourished at his court, together with many other illustrious men of genius and of science.\n\nMahmud died in the year 1030. Before which event the Suljook Toorkmans, issuing from the deserts of Scythia, pressed on his northern frontier. His feeble successors not only discontinued all attacks on the Indians, but were themselves compelled to defend Ghizni against those of the Toorkmans alluded to; who in the end established a powerful empire, extending from Samarkand to the confines of Greece and Egypt. In their progress southward and westward, whither they were attracted by the fertile plains of Asia Minor, the territory in the immediate vicinity of Ghizni was permitted to remain in the hands of a line of weak princes; till their race was finally extirpated by that of Ghor; the last of the Ghiznevide princes meeting his death in the year 1160. Of the conquests of Mahmud in India the Punjab alone remained to his successors; while the remaining provinces of Hindoostan continued unmolested by Muhamedan invasion for the long period of a century and a half.\n\nThe Ghori empire was established on the ruins of that of Ghizni, in the year 1145; nearly a century after the invasion of England by William the Conqueror: up to which period India had not suffered from any irruption of the Muhamedans subsequently to the death of Mahmud the Great. Despotisms of recent origin are always vigorous; thus, not only did the race of Ghizni fall beneath the power of Muhamed Ghori, but India itself was destined again to feel the destructive effects of the Muhamedan armies.\n\nIt was in the reign of Henry II. of England, that Muhamed Ghori led his hordes across the Punjab, and penetrated into the provinces of Dehli and Ajmeer. Unlike his prototype, Mahmud of Ghizni, Muhamed Ghori was not always victorious. On one occasion he sustained so signal a defeat from the Hindoos, that he was himself left for dead on the field of battle. He escaped however; and the Raja of Delhi being slain in action, he was enabled to advance the seat of his government from Lahore to that capital. Muhamed Ghori met his death from the hands of a Hindu assassin, in the year 1206; and the Ghiznevede empire being\nthus shaken by intestine commotion, afforded to Ybuk, a slave of Mu-\nhamed's, the opportunity of proclaiming himself king of Dehli; at a\nperiod somewhat anterior to the signature of Magna Charta by King John\nin England. A succession of princes reigned in Dehli, continually engaged\nin extending their dominions, and in propagating the Muhamedan faith: the\nprogress of both these objects, however, was comparatively slow. No Mos-\nlem general had yet ventured to cross the Nerbudda; and the Hindoo\nterritories of the Deccan still remained unpolluted by the presence of the\ncarnivorous Muhamedans, at a time when the kingdom of Dehli had attained\na degree of power not generally understood. England had just added Wales\nto her territory through the prowess of Edward the first, when we find India\nsubjected to an invasion of the Moguls of the race of Zengiz Khan. The\npower of the king of Dehli, however, enabled him to repel the repeated\nincursions of these hordes, not unfrequently exceeding one hundred thou-\nsand in number; while it was the boast and glory of Bulbun that his court\nafforded a safe retreat to thirteen sovereign princes of the West, who, ex-\npelled from their dominions by the victorious arms of Zengiz, had found an\nhonourable asylum under the shadow of his bounty. In 1294, about the\nperiod when the Turks founded the Ottoman Empire in the West, Alla-ud-\nDeen, Prince of Dehli, made a rapid incursion into the Deccan, and first\npenetrated to Devaguri, since called Dowlutabad. The information ob-\ntained in this expedition led to others after the accession of Alla-ud-Deen\nto the throne; and in less than fifty years from that time, the Muhamedans\nhad levied tribute from the Hindu princes as far south as the river Kishna.\n\nBut it is the nature of despotism to bear within itself the germs of its own\ndestruction. The power of an unlimited monarchy is but ephemeral; since\nit is liable to terminate with the existence of the individual who holds the\nsceptre. The successors of Alla-ud-Deen were incapable of sustaining the\nweight of the empire which their forefathers had acquired; and the unwise\nand capricious rule of Muhamed Toghluk, though the most accomplished\nprince that ever sat on the throne of India, led to the dismemberment of\nan empire, which justly excited the wonder of the East. Previously to his\ndeath in 1348, Bengal, Guzerat, and the Deccan, had declared themselves\nindependent; and before the conclusion of the fourteenth century, the\nterritory of the mighty Prince of Dehli, limited to within a few miles around\nthe capital, became an easy prey to the arms of Timoor; who found so little\nremaining of the splendour and power of the famous state of Dehli, that he\nquitted it in a few days, not even considering it necessary to leave a single soldier behind him to the east of the Indus. During these commotions thirteen kingdoms and six independent Muhamedan principalities had been erected in different parts of the empire. The feeble possessors of the throne of Dehli, though unable to maintain their own authority, laid claim to the obedience of all these petty states; and efforts were made by them at different periods to recover their lost dominions. Their power, however, had vanished; and rose and fell alternately, till the beginning of the sixteenth century, when it finally passed into the hands of a new race.\n\nAt that time Kashmir, Multan, Sind, Guzerat, Malwa, Behar, and Bengal, had each its sovereign to the north of the Nerbudda; while in the Deccan, the cities of Burhanpur, Elichpur, Ahmudnuggur, Bidur, Hyderabad, and Bijapur, were become the capitals of independent states, derived from the fallen empire of Dehli. Of each of these kingdoms Ferishta has thought it necessary to write a separate history; and his method of arranging this part of his work shews great judgment; while the narratives themselves evince an indefatigable spirit of enquiry, and often a great knowledge of the human heart. There is indeed, in my opinion, no point in which Ferishta so far excels all other oriental historians, as in the judicious and excellent remarks which he makes on the characters of individuals. His observations are generally free from prejudice, and always full of candour and sincerity; and it was on this account, perhaps, that he thought it right, as it was certainly judicious, to abstain from making any remarks on the personal character of his patron and prince, Ibrahim Adil Shah II. His singular good taste in this respect, and the impartiality with which he weighs the actions of Muhamedans of all sects, although himself of the Sheea persuasion, and living among Soonies, by whom the former were always more or less persecuted, must raise the character of Ferishta very high in the scale of historians.\n\nThe period to which I have brought the abstract of the work is by far more interesting than any other in the history. In the latter end of the fifteenth century, when the several minor kingdoms of Hindoostan were in the zenith of their glory, the Portuguese first reached the Indian shores; and for more than a century continued to monopolise the intercourse between the East and the West. Their connexion with the Muhamedan sovereigns of the western coast of the Peninsula, is doubly interesting; as we obtain from the pages of Ferishta details explanatory of the imperfect\nchronicles of the Western invaders. The Portuguese in 1498 found the Hindus highly civilized, and well skilled in the arts of war, commerce, and navigation. Their merchant ships traded in great numbers, even to the vicinity of the Cape of Good Hope; and their navigators used nautical instruments superior to those of Europe. They describe the Indian vessels as having more guns, and being as well equipped as their own. They used fire-ships in action; and in 1508 distinct mention is made of the Muhamedans using \"grenadoes\" and other fire-works.\n\nDon Alfonso Albuquerque, one of the greatest men of his age, so strongly attached the natives of India to him, that availing himself of the animosity existing between the Hindus and Mussulmans, he employed eight hundred of the former on board his fleet, ten years after the first arrival of Vasco de Gama on the coast. Two years afterwards he captured Goa from the Muhamedan king of Bijapur; and such was the good feeling subsisting between him and the native Indians, that he entrusted the fort to four hundred European Portuguese; while he placed Mali Rao, the Raja of Onore, in charge of the territorial acquisitions, with a body of five thousand Hindu soldiers, to protect the country from the Muhamedan king of Bijapur. From that period the Portuguese identified themselves so much with the inhabitants, that no expedition took place in which the natives did not bear a conspicuous part. Thirty-three years only had elapsed since their first intercourse with India, when the Portuguese, in 1531, fitted out an armament equal, if not superior, to any which has sailed from those shores in our own days. Four hundred sail of vessels assembled in the harbour of Bombay, manned by fourteen hundred European and five thousand Indian sailors, and conveying three thousand six hundred European and ten thousand native soldiers; in all twenty thousand men. This armada was prepared, according to orders from Europe, to take the island of Diu in Guzerat, from the Muhamedan king. All its efforts, however, were vain; and after experiencing a total defeat, the Portuguese armament returned to Goa, having merely landed and burned some towns along the coast, without possessing itself of one inch of territory. At this time Bahader Shah, the king of Guzerat, was so straightened by his enemies, that he sent (according to the Turkish historians) an ambassador to the Grand Seignor at Constantinople; and shipped off all his vast wealth to Medina, on the confines of Egypt. He was soon after engaged in an affray with the Portuguese of Goa, in which he lost his life: while his kingdom fell a prey to intrigues and\ninternal dissensions. In this state of affairs his treasures, instead of returning to India, found their way into the coffers of Soliman, who acquired, in consequence, the destructive appellation of the Magnificent.\n\nAfter this short digression concerning the Portuguese power, and that of the Muhamedan kings of the Deccan, I return to the state of the kingdom of Dehli. Torn asunder by factions, with a weak and penurious prince upon the throne, the nobles, headed by the king's brother, invited Baber the first of the race of the present Great Mogul to invade India. He made four attempts in vain; but in the fifth he slew Sikunder Lodi, king of Dehli, in the same year in which Charles V. of Germany and Francis I. of France concluded the treaty of Madrid. I do not think it necessary to trace the current of events which succeeded, till the death of Humaiun the son and successor of Baber. He left his kingdom, feebly protected, to his son Akber, a boy of twelve years of age. The energy of his preceptor and general, Bairam Khan Turkoman, preserved the tottering empire of the Moguls; and the wisdom of his pupil was evinced in the sagacity of the instruments he selected to recover the fallen fortunes of the state of Dehli. Akber was the first Muhamedan sovereign who openly gave to the Hindu princes and chiefs of India places in his court. He not only permitted the fullest toleration to their religion, but he enrolled them among his nobles, intermarried on terms of equality with their princes, and conferred upon them the most distinguished civil and military offices.\n\nThe confidence he afforded them was more than repaid by the fidelity, attachment, and devotion of these noble chieftains. Instead of having to contend alone against the factions of the late court, and to content himself with the limited tract of country which belonged to the late kings of Dehli, Akber was enabled, during a reign which was protracted to half a century, to incorporate in his empire all the Muhamedan kingdoms of India; with the exception only of Bider, Hyderabad, and Bijapur. He was succeeded by his son Selim, under the title of Jehangir; and it was to his court that Ferishta was deputed, to congratulate him on his accession, about the time when he finished his history: and when the first English East-India Company was formed, and had established a factory in Surat. Subsequently to this period our own annals serve to supply the deficiency of the Muhamedan chronicles.\n\nJehangir was succeeded by Shah Jehan: and at his death, Alumgir, or, as he is more usually called in Europe, Aurungzeb, ascended the throne.\nTo him was left the task of completing the entire subjugation of all the Muhamedan kingdoms; which he effected in 1688, the era of the great reformation in England. The enlightened wisdom of Akber was not found in the mind of Aurungzeb. To the pedantic acquirements of the scholar, he added the craft of the ascetic: and, in order either to indulge his own private feelings, or to obtain popularity among those of his own persuasion, he altogether abandoned the policy of his predecessor, which led him to strengthen his dominion by a liberal employment of his Hindu subjects. Aurungzeb levied a pole-tax upon them; and unduly favoured by every means his Muhamedan subjects. To this unwise and bigotted course is to be ascribed all the evils that threatened his territory before he died. His empire extended over all India north of the river Kishna, and contained a population of a hundred million of inhabitants.\n\nAt his death, in 1707, the flame, which his presence and his energy had tended to suppress, burst forth in all quarters. The Hindus of the Deccan were excited to a revolt, which was dignified with the appellation of a religious war; and the Muhamedans experienced to such a degree the fury of their irritated enemies, that in less than fifty years scarcely a vestige remained of their late extensive power.\n\nOn the ruins of the Mogul government arose the Maratta state, which attained a degree of strength that could hardly have been anticipated in so short a time. Half a century had scarcely elapsed from the death of Aurungzeb, ere the golden pennon of the house of Bhosla waved triumphantly on the walls of Tanjore in the south; while the soldiers who followed its standard overran the greater part of the country from the Cavery to Kashmeer, and from the Indus to the snowy range of Himala. Who could have foretold, that the government which gave ample employment to the British arms, from Trichinopoly to Gualior, in the year 1782, should be now lying prostrated at the feet of England, without a single chief absolutely free from her control! That such is the case cannot be denied. Let us not, however, repose too confidently in the magnitude of our present power. The perusal of the pages of Indian history will teach us a lesson we should never forget. The power of Mahmud of Ghizni, supported by all the enthusiasm with which religious prejudices, education, and boundless ambition could inspire the breasts of his soldiers, enabled him to hold in subjection but a very small portion of the population of India. After reigning thirty-years, he nominated a lieutenant to the province of Lahore: but his succes-\nsors found it politic to bestow on the military chiefs of the people they had conquered honourable employ under their respective governments. The Muhammedans, in fact, retained no certain hold in India till they amalgamated with its inhabitants; and the strength of each kingdom and principality rose or fell, in proportion to the degree of confidence bestowed on its native population, and to the share they bore in the government and offices of the state. The splendour, power, and magnificence of the court of Dehli, during the fourteenth century, are strongly contrasted with the imbecility which marked its fallen state in the fifteenth; and which led to its total downfall in the sixteenth. The same people who resisted for forty years with almost superhuman skill and valour the hosts of Zengiz Khan in the thirteenth century, were subdued in one battle by Baber, with less than twelve thousand men, in 1526. Of the thirteen Muhammedan princes who ruled independently of the kings of Dehli during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, eleven fell before the power of Akber in one reign: and his great grandson Aurungzeb, who ruled over the greatest extent of Indian empire of which we have any certain account, paved the way for its total dissolution in the short period of a few years. Can it be supposed that the great exertions made at one time, and the mighty revolutions so rapidly effected at others, were the mere result of accident? Ferishta has, I think, satisfactorily shewn how they came to pass. His pages are full of incident and amusement to the mere man of letters, and of instruction to the soldier, the philosopher, and the statesman; and they exhibit to the present possessors of India, examples of the energy which its population is capable of exerting when smarting under injustice and oppression.\n\nIn this point of view the necessity of studying Indian history deserves to be strongly inculcated on the minds of all who are appointed to rule over that important part of the British empire; and we are, I conceive, highly indebted to Ferishta for affording us the means of doing so, through a channel so devoid of fiction, and so free from prejudice, as the work of that celebrated historian.\n\nBefore concluding this essay it was my intention to have said something of that superb city in which Ferishta wrote his work; but neither the time nor space allotted for this paper admit of my doing so at present. A city with ramparts from ten to twenty feet in width, mounted with cannon, and five miles in circumference, exhibits a picture of no ordinary interest. Here we find the remains of superb mosques, or public places of worship, one of\nwhich is capable of containing nearly ten thousand persons. Here we see the mausoleums of kings, equal in magnificence to palaces; the dome of the largest of which exceeds that of St. Paul's, and is inferior only to that of St. Peter's at Rome; but amidst these numerous monuments of the dead, which are still standing, and excite the wonder and admiration of every modern traveller, we find none raised to Ferishta. As there is no mention made of him after the year 1612, when he must, according to our computation, have attained his forty-second year; and as he has not left behind him any of those works which he had it in contemplation to finish, we may conclude he died about that time. The court of Ibrahim Adil Shah II. was then removing to Nowrus; a city which the king intended to build within three miles of Bijapur; but which he abandoned after residing there some years, and returned to his former capital. It seems to me probable, therefore, that during these changes of the royal abode our author must have died; and was perhaps buried in the new but now dilapidated city.\n\nThis is the only way in which I can account for our not being able to find even a stone to mark the spot where his mortal remains were interred; but his countrymen may truly apply to him the lines which Milton wrote on our own immortal Shakspeare:\n\nWhat needs Ferishta, for his honor'd bones,\nThe labour of an age in piled stones;\nOr that his hallowed relics should be laid\nUnder a starry-pointing pyramid.\nGreat son of memory, great heir of fame,\nWhat needst thou such weak relic of thy name;\nWho, in our wonder and astonishment,\nHast built thyself this live-long monument;\nAnd so sepulchred, in such pomp doth lie,\nThat kings for such a tomb might wish to die.\nNotice of a Visit to the Cavern Temples of Adjunta in the East-Indies.\u2014Communicated by Lieutenant James Edw. Alexander, 16th Lancers, of the order of the Lion and Sun, M.R.A.S., Cor. Mem. S.A.E., &c.\n\nRead February 7, 1829.\n\nIt was in the month of February 1824 that, while on leave from my regiment, and travelling about the province of Berar, I visited the extraordinary excavations of Adjunta, situated in lat. 20\u00b0 25' N. and lon. 76\u00b0 12' E. These, though I believe hitherto undescribed, are as much deserving of a separate publication as the far-famed temples of Ellora; and though I spent only a few hours in their gloomy recesses, yet I saw enough to convince me that they are well worthy of a more minute investigation, and a lengthened sojourn amongst them.\n\nAfter passing the night in a well built caravanserai in the town of Adjunta,* situated at the head of the pass of the same name through one of the Berar ranges of mountains, I mounted early in the morning, arrayed in my Muselmani costume, and accompanied by a couple of servants and a guide, all of us well armed with sabres, pistols, and hunting spears. We rode through a crowd of camels with their tinkling bells, and Bunjari bullocks, reposing beside their loads of grain and salt. In passing a small party of the Nizam's horse, the Duffadar (an inferior officer) saluted us with the customary compliment of \"Salam alicum\" (Peace be with you); and enquired where we were going. I told him we proposed visiting the caves: to which he replied, \"La illah illilah!\" (There is but one God) you will never return: for if you escape the tigers, these stony-hearted robbers, the Bheels, will destroy you.\" To this I answered, \"Inshallah (please God) we'll have the pleasure of smoking a pipe with you in the evening.\" He replied, \"Khoda hafiz\" (may the Lord preserve you): and taking leave of him, we rode out of the gate which led to the head of the pass, down which our road lay.\n\n* From the Sanscrit word Ajayanti, meaning the difficult or impregnable pass.\nAfter travelling some distance along a stony road, and passing several cairns, near which were many bushes covered with rags, pointing out the spot where unfortunate travellers had been destroyed by tigers, we suddenly found ourselves at the top of the precipitous ghat or pass. The scene which now opened upon us was magnificent in the extreme. The vale of Candesh was stretched beneath our feet, extending far into the blue distance, and enclosed by wooded mountains. Jungle, small lakes, and streams scattered in every direction diversified the face of the valley; and here and there, amongst the trees, appeared the pointed top of a Hindu pagoda, or the white dome of a Moslem shrine. Near us, over the face of the hills,\n\nThe bosom-folds of mist, the morning breeze\nWreathed gracefully;\n\nand bore with it the balmy incense of oriental flowers. We now dismounted, and leading our horses down a precipitous pathway to the left of the pass, found ourselves at the bottom among sweet-smelling kuskus grass. Directing our steps towards an opening between the deeply serrated hills, we arrived at the d\u00e9bouche of the glen, and fell in with a mountain stream, along whose banks lay the pathway to the caves, leading through low underwood interspersed with trees and water-grass fifteen feet in height; amongst which, not long before, three tigers had been killed.\n\nWe had not advanced far up the glen, when a low whistling was heard above us to the left, and was quickly repeated from the opposite cliffs. This proved to be Bheels intimating to one another that strangers were approaching. The guide evinced strong symptoms of fear; but on being remonstrated with, and encouraged with the hope of a handsome present, he proceeded onwards. Some of the Bheels shewed themselves, peeping out from behind the rocks. They were a most savage looking race, perfectly black, low in stature, and nearly naked. They seemed to be armed with bows and arrows. The principal haunts of these Bheels are in the Northern Deccan, along the course of the Nerbuddah. They live entirely in the jungles, are in a state of great barbarism, and subsist by hunting, rapine, and plunder. They sometimes approach the towns and villages in the neighbourhood of their haunts, and lurk about the outskirts to attack individuals. Whilst in the caravanserai at Adjunta, a Muselman came to me for bandages for his left arm, which had been cut off at the elbow the night before. He lived outside the walls of the town in a garden, which the Bheels entered by a hole they dug under the wall; and the Muselman, in defending his pro-\nperty, was disabled by a cut from a sabre. Our fire-arms prevented their attacking us; and we were allowed to proceed unmolested.\n\nThe glen, up which our road lay, almost to its termination, where the caves are situated, was remarkable for its picturesque beauty. It continued winding amongst the hills, which rose from the banks of the stream with a considerable acclivity, and having their sides clothed with scattered jungle. Amongst the trees I observed the *melia azadirachta* (neem), the *robinia mitis*, *mimosa Arabica* (babool), *bassia latifolia* (mowah), from which a spirit is distilled, *ficus religiosa* (peepul), &c. The hills, whose height was from four to five hundred feet, now began to close in their wild and romantic features upon us; and though I cannot pretend to rival the author of \"The Wonders of Ellora\" in enthusiasm, yet it was with no common interest, and with my expectation intensely excited, that I viewed the \"low browed\" entrance to the first cave, which is not attained till a mile of the glen has been traversed.\n\nAlthough the beauty of the surrounding scenery infinitely surpassed that at Ellora, yet I cannot say, like the author above quoted, \"that my feelings were interested to a high degree of awe, wonder, and delight, at first so painful, that it was a long time before they became sufficiently sobered and calmed to contemplate, with any attention, the surrounding wonders;\" neither can I assert \"that Bruce's emotions were not more vivid or tumultuous when first beholding the springs of the Nile, than mine were on first reaching the caves;\" yet this I will say, that the retired and umbrageous situation of the Adjunta caves, completely secluded from the busy haunts of men, and enclosed with overhanging hills and woods, with a clear stream rushing past them over its rocky bed, evinced a far better and purer taste in those by whom they were excavated, than can be conceded to those who constructed the caverned temples of Ellora, in the face of a low and barren ridge.\n\nThe caves of which I am now treating are excavated in horizontal strata of grey wacke, with imbedded portions of quartz approaching chalcedony. Blood-stones, in which the portions of jasper are larger than usual, may be picked up in a water-worn state, in the bed of the stream. Indurated felspar is also in abundance.\n\nThe first cave is about forty or fifty feet above the stream, and faces the south. The whole series of caves has the same aspect, but gradually ascends higher up the ridge; the central ones being about a hundred and\nfifty feet from the stream. The most remote one is near a bluff rock of two hundred feet of elevation, over whose brow a cascade dashes during the rains, though in the dry season the face of the cliff glistens with only a scanty rill.\n\nThe first circumstance that strikes an attentive observer of these magnificent remains of antiquity and wonders of art, who has previously visited the mythological or pantheistical excavations of Ellora, is the great want of ornamental and minute sculpture in the former, compared with the exquisite and elaborate finishing of the latter. The general appearance of the Adjunta caves is similar to that of the caves of Ellora; that is, they are mostly low, with a flat roof supported by massive pillars having cushioned capitals; but there is a great deficiency in ornamental carving and fret-work. Some, however, are exceptions to this remark. In most of the caves, to compensate for the want of profuse entaille and sculptures, are paintings in fresco, much more interesting, as exhibiting the dresses, habits of life, pursuits, general appearance, and even features of the natives of India, perhaps, two thousand or two thousand five hundred years ago, well preserved and highly coloured, and exhibiting in glowing tints, of which light red is the most common, the crisp-haired aborigines of the sect of Buddhists, who were driven from India to Ceylon after the introduction of Brahminism.\n\nBefore proceeding farther with our description, let us endeavour to inquire into the antiquity of these excavations. It has generally been observed, in tracing the history of any religion, that elaborate and complicated systems of sacred rites and modes of addressing the Supreme Being are commonly posterior to more simple forms and rituals. This I should imagine applies to Buddhism; for not only in their rites, but also in their places of worship, the Buddhists display a system which appears to be much more crude and simple than that which now predominates over the greater part of the Indian continent. Reasoning from the above premises, it may be confidently affirmed that Buddhism is greatly anterior to Brahminism. The Buddhists adore one deity (some peculiarities in whose personification in these caves shall be hereafter noticed); they are monotheists, and their religion is exoteric; while the gods of the present race of Hindus are uncountable. Some speculators in Hindu mythology maintain that the chief temple in all Jain*\n\n---\n\n* The Jains and Buddhists only differed in regard to the history of the personages whom they deified: both sects reject the Vedas, or sacred books of the Hindus; worship one Deity.\nand Buddha caves being arched, shews a posterior date to the flat-roofed excavations of Elephanta, and others appropriated to the followers of Brahma: and, in support of this theory, it is said that the Hindus, previously to the Muhammedan invasion, were unacquainted with the manner of constructing the arch. But when we consider that these vast excavations must have been hewn out of the living rock, while the Jains were in the plenitude of their power, and long before the persecutions had begun by the followers of Brahma, I think we may safely assert that their antiquity is much greater than that of either the Ellora* or Elephanta excavations.\n\nRespecting the antiquity of the Jain or Buddhist religions: in the earliest accounts of India, by Arrian and other authors, and at the period of Alexander's expedition in 327 B.C., the natives are described as having long hair and slender bodies, and as being divided into different castes or tribes. It is therefore pretty evident that the religion of Buddha was then on the decline: for I think that its high antiquity may be satisfactorily proved, both from the paintings and sculptured figures in these excavations; which exhibit traces of the existence of a woolly-haired race, now nowhere found on the Indian continent; and who, according to the commonly received legend, were persecuted and scattered by the disciples of Brahma; a considerable body of them being driven to Ceylon, from whence they spread the religion of Buddha through Siam, Burma, and China. This persecution is supposed to have arisen from the Buddhist religion (when placed in immediate comparison with the Brahminical) not being suited to the taste of the inhabitants of Hindoostan, who are fond of glitter and shew, and who dazzled by the splendour of the present rites, turned from these plain and unadorned figures of Buddha, to the mysterious Trimurti, and wonder-working Avatars. From these premises I conceive the age of the caves of Adjunta to be nearer three than two thousand years.\n\nExamination of the Caves.\n\nThe principal excavation, or grand temple, is situated about a hundred and fifty feet from the bed of the nullah, or stream, and on the face of the hill. The magnificent entrance is surrounded by scattered jungle and\n\nand several subordinate saints; both excavated temples; and, in India, were divided into the four castes of priests, soldiers, merchants, and labourers. In Ava the Buddhists are not divided into castes.\n\n* One of the Ellora caves is a Jain temple; the rest are Brahminical.\nbrushwood, and is particularly striking; being a lofty portico, somewhat re-\nsembling those of Caneri and Carli. In the centre of the portico is an im-\nmense horse-shoe arch, on each side of which there stand colossal janitors,\nten or twelve feet in height, and with curled hair. At the request of the guide\nwe approached with great caution; and on coming under the arch he pointed\nto the roof, from which a number of wild bees (apis rufa) had suspended their\npendant hives. We were careful not to disturb them, or they would have\nsoon deprived us of the use of our visual organs, here so much required.\n\nWe proceeded to the interior. On looking round, I found myself in a\nlofty and well-lighted hall, which may be about twenty-five or thirty feet in\nheight, instead of the low caves with flat ceilings, as in the other parts of the\nhill. This is a well-aired chamber, and in many respects similar to the\nhigh coved excavation of Carli, or to what is commonly termed the carpent-\ner's cave at Ellora. The form of the arch is however different. In the\nCarli cave the roof bears a close resemblance to the high-pointed gothic\narch. It is ribbed with teak wood, so as to fit the cove, and is attached to\nthe stone by wooden nails or teeth. In the Ellora caves, stone ribs supply\nthe place of the teak ones of Carli; but the Adjunta cave has a Saxon or\n(nearly) semicircular roof, without ribs of any sort. Two rows of hexagonal\npillars run along the sides of the cave, and behind them is a passage. The\nentablature of the pillars is without ornament, and the pillars themselves are\nquite plain. Many of them are broken off, and have fallen on the floor.*\n\nOpposite to, and about fifty feet from the entrance, at the farther ex-\ntremity of the cave, is what is called, in descriptions of the caves of Carli,\n&c. a circular temple; but which I consider to be nothing more than the\nrostrum from which the Rhahans, or Buddhist priests, recited prayers and de-\nlivered homilies to the assembled congregation in the hall. A passage\nfrom a description of the ritual of the Siamese will illustrate this idea.\nTreating of the present state of religion in Siam, it goes on to state:\n\"Attached to the temples there are generally monasteries, and within these\nare oratories or small pulpits. In these the priests, morning and evening,\nrecite prayers. From these same pulpits they likewise preach sermons,\ntaking as a text some sentences in the Bali or language of their sacred books,\"\u2020\n\n* See the accompanying plate, fig. 1.\n\u2020 The Burmans have likewise two languages, a sacred and a vernacular. The character of the\nformer is square, like the Sanscrit, Hebrew, and Chinese; that of the latter is circular. While\nat Ava I saw some of the sacred books with gold leaves, but they are commonly made of ivory.\nand descanting on it in the vernacular language; their principal hearers on these occasions being women, who sit with their hands clasped, their feet under them, and small lighted tapers burning before them.\"\n\nThe stone hemisphere, then, probably served the purpose of a pulpit. It rests on a pedestal, somewhat larger than the hemisphere, surmounted by a square block, in shape resembling the capital of a pillar. In Ellora the figure of the deity, of gigantic dimensions, is placed on a seat in front of this hemisphere of stone; but in this cave it is omitted. In the gallery, or passage behind the pillars, are fresco paintings of Buddha and his attending supporters, with chowrees* in their hands. The thickness of the stucco is about a quarter of an inch. The colours are very vivid, consisting of brown, light red, blue, and white: the red predominates. The colouring is softened down, the execution is bold, and the pencil handled freely; and some knowledge of perspective is shewn. The figures are two feet and a half or three feet in height. The obliterating and sacrilegeous hand of the Portuguese has not exercised itself in defacing with pious rage these caves; nor are any of those mutilations visible here which are so common in the excavations which the Portuguese converted into places of worship. That these excavations served for the retirement of some monastic society, does not, I think, admit a doubt. Adjoining the large caves are several cells with stone bed-places, which, in all probability, were the abodes of the devotees: and in many there are springs of clear water.\n\nThe other caves which I visited are all flat-roofed, and generally in excellent preservation. The fetid smell, however, arising from numerous bats (vespertilio noctula) which flew about our faces as we entered, rendered a continuance inside, for any length of time, very disagreeable. I saw only one cave with two stories or tiers of excavated rock. In it the steps from the lower apartments to the upper had been destroyed by the Bheels. With our pistols cocked we ascended by the branch of a tree to the upper range of chambers; and found, in the middle of one of the floors, the remains of a recent fire, with large foot-marks around it. In a corner was the entire skeleton of a man. On the floors of many of the lower caves I observed prints of the feet of tigers, jackals, bears, monkies, peacocks, &c.; these were impressed upon the dust, formed by the plaster of the fresco paintings which had fallen from the ceilings.\u2020\n\n* Painted sticks, to which are attached the tails of the Thibet cow; used to drive away flies.\n\u2020 See the accompanying plate, fig. 2.\nThe paintings in many of the caves represent highly interesting and spirited delineations of hunting scenes, battles, &c. The elephants and horses are particularly well drawn. On the latter two men are often seen mounted. Ram and cock-fights I observed in one of the excavations. The spears are peculiar, having three knobs near the head; and there was an instrument resembling a lyre with three strings. I observed something like a zodiac; but not at all resembling the celebrated one of Dendera. The pillars, in most of the caves, resemble the cushion-capitaled ones of Elephanta. In one I saw a pair of fluted pilasters: and fluting is supposed to have originated in Greece, to prevent the spears from slipping off the columns.\n\nThe figure of the God.\n\nBuddha is commonly represented of gigantic size, in a sitting posture, and holding the little finger of his left hand between the forefinger and thumb of his right. Sir Chas. Malet and Mr. Salt tell us \"that Visw\u00e1k\u00e1rm\u00e1, or the carpenter,* says the legend, having fabricated the caves in a wondrous night of six months duration (but before he had completed them the cock crew, and they remained unfinished) retired to his hovel, having wounded his finger.\" Sir Charles, however, imagines that this is merely an attitude of devout meditation. The statues of Adjunta are well proportioned, but deficient in anatomical expression: for among nations of luxurious habits the figure of Apollo supersedes that of Hercules. The figures, however, are in perfect unison with the other sculpture of the caves. The features are of the African cast; with curled hair and prominent lips. The chiselling of the hair resembles strings of beads. In some, the hair is concealed by a tiara; in others by a conical crown, like that of the Burman Buddha: in most a drapery, similar to that on the head of the Egyptian sphynx, adorns the head. The lobes of the ears are elongated and hang upon the shoulders. The vestment, in many of the figures, consists only of a shoulder band, which may be the origin of the zenaar, or sacred string of the present race. In the left foot of the largest figure is a square hole, which is not observed in any of the others.\u2020\n\nAfter making a few hasty sketches of the lower caves, and the most interesting objects in them, I consumed some time in unavailing attempts to reach some apparently well-preserved caves higher up on the hill. We\n\n* Rather the \"architect.\" \"He whose work is the universe.\" The Vulcan of the Hindus.\n\u2020 See the accompanying plate, fig. 3.\nclambered up on our hands and knees, till stopped by a precipice; and not having ropes, we were unable to reach the caves from above: we therefore gave up the attempt in despair, and after we had partaken of a slight repast, and a chilum had been smoked in one of the best lighted and finest excavations, we returned to the horses, and rode back to the town of Adjunta.\n\nThough it was but a rapid and unsatisfactory glance (unsatisfactory in as much as my time was limited, from my leave being nearly expired) that I had of these imperishable monuments of antiquity,\n\n\\[\n\\text{Quae non imber edax non aquilo impotens} \\\\\n\\text{Possit diruere, aut innumerabilis} \\\\\n\\text{Annorum series,}\n\\]\n\nyet I was highly delighted with my excursion; and although many are the caverned temples which I have explored, and many which I wish to revisit, yet to none would I sooner return than to those of Adjunta. Several of them I was unable to examine; but the paintings alone, in such as I had an opportunity of examining, would render them much more interesting to those who might desire to become acquainted with the appearance of the ancient inhabitants of Hindustan, than the grotesque, though beautifully sculptured deities of Ellora.\n\nRoyal Military College, Sandhurst,\nAugust 1828.\nDescription of the Celestial Globe belonging to Major-General Sir John Malcolm, G.C.B., K.L.S., &c. &c., deposited in the Museum of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland. By Dr. Bernhard Dorn, For. M.R.A.S.\n\nRead February 21, 1829.\n\nAmongst those sciences which, after a long interval of ignorance and barbarity, were revived by the Mahomedan Arabs, astronomy ranks very high; and it cannot be denied, that had not the Arabs applied themselves to it with great assiduity and zeal, and encouraged all that served to promote its dissemination and advancement, after it had remained almost totally forgotten from the time of Ptolemy, the application to its study would, perhaps, never have extended over so large a portion of the globe as it has done. Although the pagan inhabitants of Arabia, before the time of Islamism, were in the habit of observing the stars, many of which they knew, and denominated by names taken from pastoral life, and several of which they even worshipped as visible gods, yet of a scientific knowledge of astronomy among them no traces can be discovered. The revival, therefore, of this celestial science, was principally attributable to their Mahomedan successors, who introduced its study into Arabia, at a time when the countries around them were immersed in the most deplorable state of mental darkness, which could only be dissipated by slow degrees.\n\nWe know that, in the middle of the thirteenth century, astronomy was so little attended to in the Greek empire, that Chionides of Constantinople, being desirious of becoming acquainted with the celestial sphere, was compelled to travel into Persia to gratify his desire. The Persians, according to his statement, were at that time so jealous of their acquirements in astronomy, (in consequence of a prophecy current amongst them, that the Christians would overthrow their empire by means derived from a knowledge of it), that it was strictly forbidden to initiate any stranger into its mysteries; and the Greek sage, notwithstanding the strong recommendations he had\nbrought with him from the Greek emperor himself, experienced much difficulty in attaining the object of his journey. Georgius Chrysococces, a Greek physician of the middle of the fourteenth century, who was greatly attached to astronomy, and to whom we shall frequently have occasion to refer in the course of this essay, had derived his knowledge of this science from the works of Chionides, of whose travels into Persia he gives the following account:\n\n\u0395\u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03b5

(Manuel) told me that a certain Chionides, brought up in Constantinople, and deeply versed in all the sciences, felt desirous to learn another language, by which he might acquire wisdom, and improve himself in the practice of medicine; and having understood from several Persians, that unless he went to Persia he could never obtain his wishes, he laid aside all other pursuits, and commenced the journey with all possible haste. On his way he stopped at Trebizond, where he met the illustrious Commenus, with whom he remained a considerable time; and upon communicating to him his intention, was treated with the greatest kindness, and received from him ample means for prosecuting his journey in safety to Persia. In a short period he had made himself acquainted with all the sciences of the Persians, and had frequent intercourse with their king, from whom he received much attention. But when he sought to be instructed in astronomy he was not able to find a teacher for that purpose; a law existing in Persia which permitted every one to study any science he might choose, but confined astronomy to the\nPersians. On his inquiring the reason of this regulation, and being told that there was an ancient belief prevailing amongst them, that their empire would be overthrown by the Greeks by the means of astronomy, he was more anxious to make himself master of this noble science; but it was only by continued exertions, and after many services rendered to the king, that he could obtain his wishes. He then, by the royal command, assembled teachers about him, and became in a short time so much respected throughout Persia for his knowledge of astronomy, that he was even honoured with the royal favour; and having amassed great wealth and purchased many slaves, he returned to Trebizond, carrying with him many books on astronomy, which he translated into Greek; and thus performed his praiseworthy task. Besides the books alluded to, he rendered into Greek the astronomical tables of the Persians.*\n\nTheodorus Meliteniota, who flourished about A.D. 1300, and was the compiler of a treatise on astronomy entitled \u1f08\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u1f74 \u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b2\u03af\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2, expressly declares in his preface that he had incorporated into his work astronomical tables compiled in Persia.* For the Arabs, who soon after the time of Mahommed had founded an extensive and firmly established empire in Arabia, were not contented to confine themselves and their new creed within its limits, but carried their victorious arms into Persia, which they conquered, and ruled over with as absolute a sway as their other dependencies; and notwithstanding the heavy losses which this unfortunate country sustained, and the destruction of its literary treasures, the sciences, under the patronage of mild and enlightened governors and princes, soon raised their heads again; and Persia and the adjoining countries became famous for the flourishing state of their literature, which did not yield to that of any other nation of that age. The consequence was, that several learned men appeared whose proficiency in astronomy procured them an honourable place among the astronomers of that period. The learned Alcazvini (who died in 1283), to whom we are indebted for an accurate account of the constellations known to the Arabs, and the names of the stars of which they consist, was a native of Persia.\n\nWe find ample information on this subject in his work entitled Aj\u0101\u02beib Almakhl\u016bk\u0101t (\u0625\u062c\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062e\u0644\u0648\u0642\u0627\u062a) of which the chapter descriptive of the constellations has been published by that accomplished astronomer, Professor\n\n* \u0395\u1f34\u03c4\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 (\u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf\u03bd) \u03c4\u1f70\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03c3\u1ff6\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bd\u03ad\u03c9\u03bd \u03a8\u03b7\u03c6\u03bf\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c8\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03be\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2 \u1f22 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u1f76 \u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b7\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b2\u03af\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03cd\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5.\n\nVol. II.\nIdeler of Berlin;* whose instructive annotations greatly enhance the value of his translation, and have afforded me considerable assistance in describing the constellations of the globe preserved in the museum of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nAlcazvini, however, was not the only astronomer who did honour to his native country: many others might be enumerated if the limits of this essay permitted me to expatiate upon the subject: but as brevity is necessary, the only remark I presume to add is, that the author of the treatise on the construction of the astrolabe, from which I have inserted extracts in this memoir, as explanatory and confirmatory of what Alcazvini asserts, appears to have been a Persian, although of a later period; his name is Abd ul Rahman Sherif, and his work was compiled in 1743, under the title of \u0645\u06a9\u0633\u06cc\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0627\u0628\u0642 Maksed Ulmutalib.\n\nIt was especially under the patronage of the Khalifs of the Abbasside race, who began to reign A.D. 749, that the flourishing state of the science of astronomy commenced: for these Khalifs, contrary to the usual bigotry of Mohammedan princes, delighted to sacrifice ancient prejudices to the welfare of literature, and assembled around them the learned of all denominations. The first of them who introduced a decided taste for the sciences into his kingdom, and who may be designated as the founder of the successful cultivation of astronomy, was Almansur, who ascended the throne in the year 754; and the astronomer who may claim the merit of having seconded and carried into effect Almansur's noble designs, and thus left a precedent to others, was Mohammed ben Ibrahim Al-fazari.\n\nThe Khalif Mahdi succeeded his father Almansur, and inherited his taste for literature: he was succeeded by Harun Alrashid, who was not less distinguished for the zeal with which he promoted all literary pursuits. It is a fact well known, that he presented to the emperor Charlemagne (amongst other valuable presents) an astronomical watch: which proves the great progress the Arabs had made in the arts and sciences during his reign. Under his auspices many Greek authors were translated into Arabic. The works of Ptolemy chiefly attracted the attention of the mathematicians and astronomers; and the Almagest (the title given by the\n\n* Untersuchungen \u00fcber den Ursprung und die Bedeutungen der Sternnamen, von L. Ideler. Berlin, 1809, 8vo.\nArabs to Ptolemy's \\(\\sigma\\iota\\upsilon\\tau\\alpha\\zeta\\varsigma\\mu\\epsilon\\rho\\iota\\sigma\\tau\\eta\\) was several times rendered into their language, and commentaries written upon it descriptive of the names and figures of the constellations. The only alteration the Arabs allowed themselves to make in the names, was to translate them into their own language, or to substitute for such as they could not understand, other denominations, that conveyed an idea to their minds applicable to the constellations before their eyes; thus they called Andromeda, \"the chained lady;\" Cassiopea, \"the lady in her chair;\" Orion, \"the giant,\" &c. In some cases, however, they retained the names which had been handed down to them from their ancestors.\n\nThese names alone afford sufficient proof, that Christian Europe derived its knowledge of astronomy from the Mohammedans; and a glance at a list of the stars will incontrovertibly shew, that many of their names are derived from the Arabic language, although they are often so much mangled and disfigured as to render it a matter of difficulty to trace them to their origin.\n\nBut the monarch who most distinguished himself in the promotion of literature and science, was the Khalif Almamun, who reigned from 812 to 833. An ardent encourager of letters, and particularly of astronomy, with which he was so conversant, that he made astronomical observations himself, and determined the obliquity of the ecliptic to be \\(23^\\circ 35'\\), he evinced his zeal by inviting a great number of distinguished men to Bagdad, for the purpose of improving astronomical instruments, and thus enabling observers to acquire an accurate knowledge of the motions of the heavenly bodies. Such works of Greek literature, also, as had not been at all translated, or at least not satisfactorily, but appeared to be worth rendering into Arabic, were confided by him to the most able scholars for translation.\n\nMany princes imitated Almamun's illustrious example, and we read of several who made astronomical observations themselves. Naser ben Mohamed Abul Giouch, king of Castile, was much devoted to astronomy; in which he acquired such proficiency as enabled him to construct some useful astronomical instruments. The Mongol, Hulagu Khan, about A.D. 1264, erected an observatory in his capital, Maragha, near Tabriz, under the superintendance of Nasir ud Din Tusi, and was so strongly attached to the astronomers whom he had brought to Maragha, that he even expressed a wish to die amongst them. With equal, or perhaps greater ardour, was astronomy encouraged by Ulugh Beg, grandson of the conqueror Timour,\nwho was born in 1393, at Sultania, near Kazvin, and died in 1444. He was thoroughly acquainted with the mathematical sciences, and caused a magnificent academy to be erected at Samarkand, whither the most learned men of the time flocked to partake of his patronage. Ulugh Beg's name has acquired perpetual lustre by the compilation of astronomical tables, which, to this day, are held in high esteem.\n\nThat such application to astronomy did not fail to produce many learned works upon that science, as well as various instruments connected with its study, may be inferred from what has been already said; and it has been clearly ascertained that the construction of astronomical instruments at that period was brought to a high degree of perfection. Not only astrolabes, but also celestial globes were made; and many astronomers are expressly recorded as having been particularly expert in the construction of them.* Ebn Alnabdi, who was himself an extremely clever mechanic, mentions two globes which he had examined, and admired for the excellence of their execution, in the public library at Kahira in 1043. One of them he describes to have been made of brass by Ptolemy himself, which, of course, cannot be adduced as a proof of Mohammedan skill; but the second, made of silver, was constructed by Abul Hassan Alsufi, for the immediate\n\n* Of the many individuals recorded as having added to a knowledge of astronomy that of constructing instruments, I think it not improper to give here a short list; such a one, to my knowledge, having never yet been published. Amongst those whom Almamun invited to Bagdad for the cultivation of this science we may name the following, viz.: Abbas ben Said Algouhari; Send ben Ali; Yahya ben Abi, Monsur Almamuni (or astronomer to Almamun), &c. Besides whom may be mentioned, Abu Jafar ben Ahmed Habush; Ali Abul Hassan ben Ismael Giouhari, at Bagdad; Alhassan ben Alhassan ben Alhaitham Abul Ali Albasri, who wrote on almost every branch of mathematics and astronomy; Fath ben Nagiaba, surnamed Al-Astralabi (died A.H. 1058); Mohammed ben Isa ben Ali; Harun ben Ali ben Yahya ben Mansur, who flourished at Bagdad, under the government of the Dilemides; and Habbat Allah ben Alhossain Abul Kasem, who also flourished at Bagdad, in the time of the khalif Mostarshed. The most skilful mechanic, however, according to the testimony of the Mohammedan authors, was Ahmed ben Mohammed, a Persian, who not only made the finest instruments, but invented several new ones, to the great advantage of the science.\n\nAmongst those above mentioned, are some who wrote also on the construction and use of instruments: for instance, Jafar ben Ahmed ben Habush; Mohammed ben Isa ben Ali, and others. The following Mohammedans published treatises on the astrolabe, viz. Thabet ben Korra, about 840; Abu Ali Hussain ben Ahmed ben Maz Alaslemi, about 1274; Ahmed ben Alsophar, cf Cordova; Mohammed Sebth, of Maredin; Moslama ben Ahmed Almagrebi, of Spain; Ali ben Isa Alashbili, of Seville; Mohammed ben Omar ben Alfarkan; Abu Bir Fadhl Mashalla, &c.\nuse of the king Adad Eddoula (of the race of the Buides), who had declared himself independent, and had even established himself in Bagdad, where nothing was left to the Khalif but the Imamut, or supreme ecclesiastical dignity.\n\nWe should, however, form but an imperfect judgment of the mechanical skill of these learned men, if no instruments executed by them had reached our time. This, fortunately, is not the case; and the few that have been preserved must be looked upon as highly valuable monuments, illustrative not only of the astronomical works written by Mohammedans, but also as furnishing the means to enable us to judge accurately of their proficiency in the science itself. Only three, or at the most four, of these globes are known to have escaped the injuries of time; and as the object of this essay is to give an account of one of them, I have thought it proper to prefix a brief description of the others.\n\nThe first and oldest of these globes, of which a description has been given to the public, belonged to the extensive and celebrated collection of antiquities and curiosities of the late Cardinal Borgia, at Velletri, in Italy. It was made of brass in A.H. 622 (A.D. 1225) in Egypt, in the reign of king Alhamet, by Kaissar ben Abul Kasem ebn Musafer Elabiaki Alhanefi, as the Cufic inscription intimates, and has been described by Simon Assemani, in a work entitled \"Globus coelestis Cufico-Arabicus Veliterni Musei Borgiani, a Simone Assemano (LL.Or.Prof.) illustratus. Patav. 1790, 4to.\" But although Assemani, being a native of the East, was thoroughly conversant with the Arabic language, he could not avoid being sometimes greatly mistaken in the names of the stars, which he had to make out from a very bad and inaccurate copy of the globe transmitted to him; and his publication must therefore be perused with some caution.\n\nThe second globe, also of brass, is deposited in the Astronomical Museum at Dresden, in Saxony, and was very accurately and skilfully illustrated by Counsellor Beigel, in Bode's Astronomischem Jahrbuch for 1808. It was constructed in the year 1289, by Mohammed ben Movajed Alardhi, an astronomer at Hulagu Khan's court, at Maragha; and the characters engraven on it appear, from a specimen given by Professor Ideler, to bear a strong resemblance to those on the globe deposited in the museum of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nThe third globe, of rather a smaller size, and which I had an opportunity of seeing and examining myself, was brought to England from India, and\nbelongs to the Astronomical Society of London. The names of the stars on it are engraven in Arabic; without, however, the figures of the constellations being added. Neither the year of its construction, nor the name of the maker, appear on it; but it is evidently of so very recent a date, that it has been even supposed to have been made in England. We know, at least, that it was once the custom in Holland, to construct celestial globes with the names of the stars in Latin and Arabic.\n\nThe fourth globe is preserved in the museum of the Royal Asiatic Society, in which it was deposited by Sir John Malcolm, and is undoubtedly one of its most valuable curiosities. It is made of brass, and apparently of Persian workmanship; which not only the manner in which the animal figures are represented, but also the mode of denoting the year of its construction, seem to indicate. The inscription, which is engraven in Cufic characters, in the vicinity of the South Pole, runs thus:\n\n\u0635\u0646\u0639\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0642\u064a\u0628 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u062a\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0647\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u062c\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0635\u0644\u064a \u0641\u064a \u0633\u0646\u0629 \u062e\u0645\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0626\u0629 \u0647\u062c\u0631\u064a\u0629, i.e.\n\n\"Made by the most humble in the supreme God, Mohammed ben Helal, the astronomer of Mousul, in the year of the Hejra 674.\"\n\nThis year answers to the year 1275 of the Christian era, and proves the globe to have been made in the same century in which both the Borgian globe and that at Dresden were constructed.\n\nThis globe has, besides the constellations then known, amounting to forty-seven, including the signs of the Zodiac, the other requisites of a celestial globe; the Zodiac, with the degrees marked on it; the ecliptic, &c.; and we find in their respective places on the circumference of the horizon, the words \u0634\u0631\u0642 east, \u063a\u0631\u0628 west, \u0634\u0645\u0627\u0644 north, \u062c\u0646\u0648\u0628 south. But as the globe is accessible to every member of the Society, I think it unnecessary to dwell longer on its mere form, and shall therefore proceed to the constellations and their stars, which are to be found upon its surface.*\n\nThe Northern Constellations.\n\n1. \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0635\u063a\u0631 The Lesser, or Little Bear.\n\n\u0391\u03c1\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1 Arctos, Ursa Minor.\n\nThis constellation, according to Kazvini, consists of twelve stars; seven of which lie within, and five without the figure; and which together are\n\n* The constellations of the northern hemisphere, as represented on this globe, are given in the accompanying plate A.; those of the southern hemisphere, in plate B.\ncalled the pivot of the mill; on this globe, however, there appear only eight. The seven stars lying within are called the lesser Benat-nash, or Daughters of the Bier; which name they bear on account of their being compared by the Arabs to mourning daughters, or females preceding a bier: the bier being formed by the four stars in the belly, and the daughters by the three in the tail of the animal. The star at the extremity of the tail, which is supposed to point out the direction of the Kebla, is called the Kitten; in the vicinity of which there is a hole made in the globe, representing the north pole, which is denoted by the words adjoining, the north pole. Ebn Mahommed Sherif says, \"One of the two stars which lies at the side of the Benat-nash, near the Kitten, is the north pole.\" The two bright stars in the bier \\( \\beta, \\gamma \\), are called the two Calves, from the calf. Hariri compares bright eyes to these two stars, see Makama 7: \"He then opened his two noble (eyes) and looked about with his two twins, so that the two lights of his face sparkled, as though they were the two Calves.\"\n\n2. The Greater Bear.\n\n\\(\\text{\u0391\u03c1\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2 Arctos, Ursa Major.}\\)\n\nThe constellation of the Greater Bear was known in the remotest ages of antiquity, and is mentioned in the book of Job by the name of the Bear; the three stars in the tail being denominated its sons: see chap. ix. 9; and xxxviii. 32. This explanation of the word is also confirmed by the learned Rabbin Aben Esra, who was deeply versed in astronomy, and interprets by the more common noun , the bear. The following stars are pointed out by name on the globe: the Ghazels, comprising those on the eyes, eyebrows, ears, and mouth; their young ones (which, on the Borgian globe, is written , the ghazels and their young) lying between the fore and hind feet, and amounting, according to Kazvini, to the number of six. Three other names of stars referring to ghazels, are , the first leap, on the right hind-foot; , the second leap, on the right fore-foot; and , the third leap, on the left fore-foot. The four bright stars in the belly, making a square, are termed , a bier. Tizini gives four\nparticular names for them, in conformity with their respective positions, namely: \u0638\u0647\u0631, the back, \u03b1; \u0639\u0631\u0642, the loins, \u03b2; \u0641\u062e\u0630, the thigh, \u03b3; and \u0645\u063a\u0631\u0632, the rump, \u03b4. In the shoulder we find the star called \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0648\u0636, the Pond. At the commencement of the tail is the first bright star, denominated \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062c\u0648\u0646 Al-djoun, whence originated the word Alcor, in common use with our astronomers. The large star in the middle of the tail, is \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0646\u0627\u0642, the Goat; and the little darker one close to it, \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064a\u0627 Al-soha, the Forgotten, or Concealed. Hariri says: \"\u0648\u0643\u0645 \u0645\u0634\u0643\u0644\u0627\u062a \u062d\u0643\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u062e\u0641\u0627\u0641\u0627\u064b \u062a\u0635\u0631 \u0628\u0643\u0634\u064a \u0634\u0645\u0648\u0633\u0627\u064b How often difficult things resemble the Soha in abstruseness, but become suns by my interpretation.\" Makama, 32. The last star at the extremity of the tail is \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0626\u062f Alca\u00efd, the Governor, or Leader; which has passed into the Spanish language as Alcaide. These three stars are together called \u0628\u0646\u0627\u062a \u0646\u0639\u0634 Benat-nash, the daughters of the Bier. Under the tail of the Bear, we may observe two stars, and with them their denomination \u0630\u0646\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u062f, the tail of the Lion.\n\n3. (\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0646\u064a\u0646) Hebr. \u05d9\u05b0\u05e8\u05b5\u05df The Dragon.\n\u0394\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03c9\u03bd Draco.\n\nThis constellation consists of thirty-one stars, but the globe furnishes only five names. The star in the tongue (\u03bc) has been represented by the Arabs as resembling a person dancing, and is consequently called \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u062a\u0633 the dancer; which corresponds with the four stars in the head called, \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0648\u0627\u064a\u062f the players on lutes; for thus we read it, with Ulugh Beg and Sherif, in preference to \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u062a\u0633 which Ideler and Beigel believe to be more correct. In about the middle of the body we behold two stars (\u03be, \u03b7) situated close to each other, and each of them marked with the name \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a\u0628 the wolf; another, at some distance from the last, towards the tail, is termed \u0627\u0644\u0630\u0628\u062e the hyena.\n\n4. (\u062a\u064a\u0641\u0627\u0624\u0633) Cepheus.\n\u039a\u03b5\u03c6\u03ad\u03c5\u03c2 Cepheus.\n\nThe name of this asterism is written distinctly enough not to read Cekeus, as we sometimes find it spelt. The star in the breast (\u03be) is called \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u062c\u0629 the Fissure; that on the right foot \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0645\u064a the Shepherd; and that on the left \u0643\u0644\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0645\u064a the Shepherd's Dog.\n5. The Crier.\n\n\u0392\u03bf\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, \u0391\u1f30\u03b3\u03b9\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03b1\u03be, Bootes.\n\nThe Arabic denomination of this constellation, which comprises twenty-two stars within, and one without the figure, is evidently a mistranslation of the Greek word \u0392\u03bf\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, which the Arabs seem to have mistaken for \u0392\u03bf\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 the crier. The globe gives only two names; first, the name of the star in the left shin bone (\u03c5) the Spear; and secondly, that between the thighs, Essim\u0101k err\u0101mih, the Ear with a spear (Arcturus), which has passed over into the Alphonsine tables in the words Ascimech aremeah. Chrysococces, in conformity with the Arabic denomination, calls the star \u039a\u03bf\u03c1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, from \u1f00\u03cc\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 a javelin.\n\n6. The Northern Crown.\n\nPers. \u06a9\u0627\u0633\u0647 \u062f\u0631\u0648\u0628\u06cc\u0634\u0627\u0646, \u03a3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b2\u03cc\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, Corona Borealis.\n\nThis asterism, which consists of seven stars within the figure, has the name of one only marked on the globe; namely, the bright star of the Crown. Alcazvini calls it.\n\n7. The kneeling (Hercules).\n\n\u0395\u1f50 \u03b3\u03cc\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd, Geniculatus, Engonasin, &c.\n\nThe denomination \u1f10\u03b3\u03ba\u03ac\u03b8\u03b9 has been applied to this asterism, on account of its representing a man kneeling: on the globe we find the star in the cheek called \u03ba\u03bb\u1fc6\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2 \u1fe5\u03ac\u03c0\u03b9 the Shepherd's Dog; and near the left arm, extended across the breast, the words \u1f21\u03c3\u03c4\u1f76 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9 the Syrian string.\n\n8. The Lyre.\n\n\u03a7\u03af\u03bb\u03c9\u03c2, Lyra.\n\nOf ten stars, of which, according to Kazvini, this constellation consists, I can only discover eight on the globe; of which the brightest bears the name \u1f21 \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd \u03b5\u1f30\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd the falling Vulture; in Chrysococces, \u1f21 \u1f41\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03b1\u03af\u03b1\u03bd. I may observe that the word wega in the Alphonsine tables, which is often used by astronomers, is merely a corruption of the word \u1f21 \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd \u03b5\u1f30\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd El w\u0101ki, the falling.\n9. \u0627\u0644\u062f\u062c\u0627\u062c\u0629 The Hen (Swan).\n\n\u039f\u03c1\u03c5\u03b3\u03b3\u03b9, \u03ba\u03cd\u03ba\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, Ales, Volucris, Olor, Cygnus.\n\nIn this constellation we may number eighteen stars; although Kazvini says it comprises only seventeen perfect and two imperfect ones. The four stars in a straight line that cross the milky way (\u03b4, \u03b3, \u03b5, \u03be) are denominated \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0648\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0633 the Horsemen; the word on the globe being engraven across the breast. The bright one in the tail which is next to the four Horsemen (\u03b1) is called \u0630\u0646\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u062c\u0627\u062c\u0629 the Backrider, but it is more commonly designated \u0630\u0646\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u062c\u0627\u062c\u0629 the Tail of the Swan. This name, however, does not appear on the globe.\n\n10. \u0646\u0628\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0631\u0633\u064a The Lady in her chair.\n\n\u039a\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b9\u03cc\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1, Cassiopeia.\n\nThe brightest star (\u03b2) of the thirteen that appear on the globe in this constellation, is denominated \u0627\u0644\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0636\u0631\u0627\u0621 the Dyed Hand; in Chrysococces, \u03a7\u03b5\u03af\u03c1 \u03b2\u03b5\u03b2\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd; the stars between the right leg and the left arm of Perseus are called \u0645\u0639\u0635\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0646 the arm of the Pleiades.\n\n11. \u062d\u0627\u0645\u0644 \u0631\u0623\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0648\u0644 The Bearer of Medusa\u2019s Head.\n\n\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03c3\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2, Perseus.\n\nThe figure of this constellation represents a man standing upon the left foot, lifting up the right, stretching the right hand over his head, and holding in the left a monstrous head, called \u0631\u0623\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0648\u0644 the head of the monster, or Medusa. To the star on the right side the name \u062c\u0646\u0628 \u0628\u0631\u0634\u0627\u0648\u0634 the side of Perseus, (in Chrysococces, \u03a0\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03c1\u03ac \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03c3\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2,) has been assigned; and it appears thus on the globe.\n\n12. \u0645\u0644\u0643\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0639\u0646\u0629 The Charioteer.\n\n\u0391\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03b3\u03b1, Auriga.\n\nThis constellation is situated between the Pleiades and the Great Bear, and comprises fourteen stars, of which the globe only specifies four by name; viz. the bright star on the left shoulder, \u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0646 the Kitten, in Chrysococces \u0391'\u03b1\u03ba, Capella: that in the right shoulder, \u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0646 the Goat; and that on the right knee, \u03b5\u03be\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae, haedi, the two He-goats.\n13. \u0625\u0650\u0639\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064f The Charmer of Serpents.\n\n'Ophi\u0113xos, Angoifer, serpentarius;\n\nwith \u0625\u0650\u0639\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0631\u064f the serpent; \u1f48\u03c6\u03b9\u03c2, Anguis, Serpens.\n\nThe name of the star on the head of the human figure is \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0639\u064a the Shepherd; that of the star in the part of the serpent crossing the body of the man, \u0627\u0644\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0633\u064e\u0642\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064f\u0651\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0650\u064a\u064f\u0651 the Yemen or southern string, \u0627\u0644\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0633\u064e\u0642\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0634\u064e\u0651\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0644\u0650\u064a\u064f\u0651 the northern string, which, according to Kazvini, is contained in the same asterism, we find placed on the globe in the constellation of the kneeling Hercules; as it is also on the globe at Dresden.\n\n14. \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064e\u0651\u0647\u0645\u064f The Arrow.\n\n'Oior\u016bs, \u03c4\u03ac\u03be\u03b9\u03c2, Sagitta.\n\nTurkish: \u0627\u0648\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0631\u064f \u062a\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064f (a bare, unfeathered arrow).\n\nThis constellation comprises five stars; but the globe is destitute of the Arabic denominations of the stars in this asterism.\n\n15. \u0627\u0644\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0633\u0631\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0637\u064e\u0651\u0627\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0631\u064f The flying Eagle.\n\n'A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101s, Aquila.\n\nThis constellation contains, according to Kazvini, nine perfect stars and six imperfect ones, and is properly called \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0627\u0628\u064f the Eagle. Three of its stars are termed \u0627\u0644\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0633\u0631\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0637\u064e\u0651\u0627\u064e\u0628\u0650\u064a\u0631\u064f, which appellation is marked on the globe, without that mentioned by the Persian astronomer.\n\n16. \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064e\u0651\u0644\u0641\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064f The Dolphin.\n\n\u0394\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, Delphinus.\n\nIt contains, according to Sherif, ten stars; four of which, in the middle of the constellation (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4) are denominated \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064e\u0639\u0652\u062f\u064f\u0648\u0646\u064e; which word, however, I conceive to be mistaken by the engraver for \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u062f\u064f the Knots; which both Alcazvini and Sherif give as the name of these stars.\n\n17. \u0642\u064e\u0637\u0652\u0639\u064e\u0629\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0631\u0633\u0650 Part of the Horse (the Horse's head).\n\n\u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ae, Sectio equi.\n\nThe Arabic name of this asterism is a literal translation of the Greek word \u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ae, which denotes that part of the body in animals, for which, in men, the word \u03a0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03bd, the face, is used. No names of the stars that compose this constellation appear on the globe.\n18. The greater Horse.\n\nThis constellation, according to Sherif, comprises twenty stars, of which six are pointed out by name on the globe. The pair in the neck are called the beneficent star of the Hero; the two in the heart (\u03bc, \u03bd) the beneficent star of the brave Man; and those in the right knee (\u03b7, \u03bf,) the beneficent star of Rain. Further on, in the body, we meet with the word the Rope of a Bucket, applied to the two stars in the body (\u03c4, \u03c5); the pair (\u03b1, \u03b2,) that lies over them, is called the first aperture of the Bucket, in opposition to the second aperture; which we read across the body where it ends.\n\n19. The Chain; but probably mis-written for\n\nThe chained Lady; Andromeda.\n\nThis asterism, according to Kazvini, contains twenty-three stars, besides a bright one that is common to it and the navel of the horse; on the globe I could only discover twenty. One star in the waist (\u03c3) is called the Belly of the Fish, which Ulugh Beg calls the side of the Chained Lady. The star of the third magnitude (\u03b3) in the foot, which Ulugh Beg denominates the foot of the Chained Lady, is termed on our globe, literally the Earth-goat, a species of lynx, called in Persian.\n\n20. The Triangle.\n\nIt consists of four stars: the name of the star at the top of the figure is so indistinctly written that I am not able to decypher it. Ulugh Beg, Tizini, Kazvini, and Sherif, call it the point of the Triangle.\n\nThe Signs of the Zodiac.\n\nThe Zodiac was known to the Arabs under the name of the Girdle of the Castles: the word, of which is the plural, being derived from the Greek \u03c0\u03cd\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2, a castle, and originally denoting a tower; as though the twelve compartments of the Zodiac were twelve castles, in which the celestial signs were placed.\n21. The Ram.\n\n\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2, Aries.\n\nThe pair of stars (\u03b2 \u03b3) on the horn, is called the Marks; those in the tail (\u03b5 \u03b4), with the one on the left leg (\u03b5 \u03b7), forming an equilateral triangle, bear the name of the Little Belly; which is also the name of the second mansion of the moon. Sheriff says: \"The Ram has thirteen stars, and five imperfect ones; amongst the former are the two Marks and the Little Belly.\"\n\n22. The Bull.\n\n\u03a4\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, Bos, Taurus.\n\nThis constellation, according to Kazvini, is composed of thirty-two stars. The large and reddish star in the southern eye is denominated Debran, but more commonly written with the article, Al debran; which name, in Ulugh Beg and Tizini, denotes the Hyades. The group of stars between the shoulders are the Pleiades; which word also has commonly the article al prefixed. This constellation, the Pleiades, was known to the author of the book of Job; who says, chap. xxxviii, v. 31: \"Canst thou fasten the bands of the Pleiades?\" Ebn Mohammed Sherif has the following remark:\n\n\"The constellation most known to almost every one is the Pleiades, called also the star. It consists of five stars which lie near to each other, in the form of a bunch of grapes, resting upon the Bull's back; but, according to some, it contains six or seven stars.\"\n\nOvid says, (Fast. iv, 70).\n\n\"Pleiades * * * * *\n\nQuae septem dici, sex tamen esse solent.\"\n\n23. The Twins.\n\n\u0394\u03af\u03b4\u03c5\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9, Gemini.\n\nKazvini numbers eighteen perfect stars and seven imperfect ones as belonging to the Twins. The name of the two bright ones in the head of the Twins\nis the Arm; that of the pair in the foot of the second Twin, which probably is to be read , a mark burnt in on the Camel's neck.\n\n24. Cancer, the Crab.\n\u039a\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, Cancer.\n\nWe find on the globe only one star pointed out by name in this constellation, viz. the Manger, \u03c0\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd; which is also applied to the eighth mansion of the moon.\n\n25. The Lion.\n\u039b\u03ad\u03c9\u03bd, Leo.\n\nThe Lion consists, according to Kazvini, of twenty-seven perfect, and eight imperfect stars. On the head there is an inscription which I am unable to decypher. The four stars in the neck and the heart are denominated the Forehead; which also designates the tenth mansion of the moon. One of these stars is distinguished by the particular name of Kalb-el-Asad, the Lion's heart, whence the term Kalbelesed in the astronomical tables is derived. It occurs also under the name of Regulus, the little king, as Aratus has used the word instead of the other name; and Ulugh Beg has rendered it the Royal (star). The pair of stars on the loins and thigh are known by the name of the hair of the Lion's mane; being also the name of the eleventh mansion of the moon. The name of the star at the extremity of the tail on the globe is the Change; inasmuch as, according to Kazvini, the change of weather depends on its setting or rising at different times.\n\n26. The Ear (the Virgin).\n\u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, Virgo.\n\nIn this sign we find the names of three stars on the globe. The group of stars at the extremity of the left shoulder, which serves also to designate the thirteenth mansion of the moon, is known under the general appellation of the Barker. The bright star in the vicinity of the hand is the unarmed Spearman, called by Chrysococces \u03bc\u03c5\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2; and that situated near the left foot is the Covering or Carpet; to which denomination the Greek word \u03c3\u03cd\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1 (the training-gown) has given rise.\n27. \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0632\u0627\u0646 The Balance.\n\n\u03a3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c6\u03ac\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2, Libra.\n\nNone of the stars of this sign have been considered worthy of being pointed out by name. One however, situated near it, but properly belonging to the Scorpion, is termed \u0627\u0644\u0632\u0631\u0627\u0646\u064a\u064a\u0646 Al-zubenen, the Claws; whence the word Azubenen has been derived, or rather corrupted.\n\n28. \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0631\u0628 The Scorpion.\n\n\u03a3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03c0\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2, Scorpius.\n\nThe Scorpion contains, according to Alcazvini, twenty-one perfect and three imperfect stars. The three stars in the forehead (\u03b2, \u03b4, \u03c9), to which Ulugh Beg adds a fourth (\u03b3), and supposed to form the crown of the Scorpion, are called \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0643\u064a\u0644\u064a the Crown, and indicate also the seventeenth mansion of the moon. The large bright star in the body is called the Scorpion\u2019s heart, \u062a\u0644\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0631\u0628, \u039a\u03b1\u03c1\u03b4\u03af\u03b1 \u03a3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03c0\u03af\u03bf\u03c5; and the pair near the extremity of the tail \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0648\u0644\u0629 (\u03b1, \u03bd) the point or sting of the Scorpion\u2019s tail. Upon this constellation, Ebn Mahommed makes the following remark:\n\n\"\u0648\u0647\u064a \u0645\u0646 \u0623\u0634\u0647\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u062c\u0648\u0645\u060c \u0648\u0639\u0631\u0641\u062a \u0641\u064a \u0643\u0644 \u0645\u0643\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0648\u062a\u0642\u0639 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0642 \u0645\u0646 \u0645\u0646\u0632\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0645\u0631.\"\n\n\"The constellation of the Scorpion is known to every one; on the buttock there is a bright reddish star of the second magnitude, which is the Scorpion\u2019s heart, and one of the mansions of the moon.\"\n\n29. \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u0633 The Bow (the Archer).\n\n\u03a4\u03bf\u03be\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, Sagittarius, Arcitenens.\n\nThis sign numbers thirty-one stars, which are included within the confines of the figure. Eight stars in its head, denoting also the twentieth mansion of the moon, are known under the name of \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0639\u0627\u0645 the Camels going to pasture. The stars in the left shin-bone and the thigh (\u03b1, \u03b2), to each of which the Borgian globe gives a particular name, viz. \u0631\u0643\u0628 the Knee, and \u0639\u0631\u0648\u0642 the Tendon, are comprehended on our globe under the appellation \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0645\u064a the Archer\u2019s Tendon. The word \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0644\u0627\u062f\u0629, which is to be read at the extremity of the band of the Archer\u2019s cap, denotes, according to Kazvini, a spot in the heavens where there is an obscure star, not easy to be observed, and surrounded by six small dull stars, called \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0627\u062a\u064a the Strings of Pearl. It\nis also the term used to signify the twenty-first mansion of the moon. This spot is, according to Ebn Mohammed Sheriff, called also \u0627\u0644\u0645\u063a\u0627\u0631\u0629 the Desert, and \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062c\u0648\u0629 the Fissure.\n\n30. \u0623\u0633\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062f\u064a Capricorn.\n\n\u0391\u1f30\u03b3\u03bf\u03ba\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9\u03c2, Aigoceros, Capricornus.\n\nThe twenty-eight stars composing this sign lie all within the compass of the figure. The two stars on the eastern horn (\u03b1, \u03b2) bear the name of \u0633\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0628\u0651 the beneficent star of the Butcher; thus denominated from a small star close to it, which the Arabs consider as a sheep to be slain.\n\n31. \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0644\u0648 The Ewer (Waterbearer).\n\n\u03a4\u03ac\u03c1\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2, Aquarius.\n\nIn this sign we find three names on the globe. The three stars on the left hand are called \u0633\u0639\u062f \u0628\u0644\u062d the beneficent star of the Devourer; the pair of stars in the left shoulder (\u03b2, \u03b5) together with that in the tail of Capricorn, denoting the twenty-fourth mansion of the moon \u0633\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u062f the beneficent star of Fortune; and the one in the upper part of the right arm, together with the three in the right hand, \u0633\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0636\u0631 the beneficent star of the Concealed; so called, according to Kazvini, because, on their rising, the worms that were concealed in the earth during the cold season creep out of their holes. This explanation, however, does not appear very satisfactory; and it is much more probable, that \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0636\u0631 is the plural of the word \u062e\u064a\u0645\u0629 signifying a tent made of wool or camel's hair, and supported by three poles; which denomination is exceedingly appropriate to the stars in question, as they form an equilateral triangle with one star in the centre, thus affording the appearance of a tent. See Ideler, p. 199.\n\n32. \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0648\u062a The Fish.\n\n\u03a0\u03b9\u03c3\u03af\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2, Pisces.\n\nAs no star of this sign is named on the Globe, I shall merely insert here what Ebn Mohammed Sheriff says respecting it: \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0648\u062a \u0648\u064a\u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0645\u0643\u064a\u0646 \u0643\u0648\u0643\u0628\u0647 \u0627\u0631\u0628\u0639\u0629 \"The Fish, or the Fishes, embrace thirty-four perfect and four imperfect stars.\"\nThe Southern Constellations.\n\n33. \u0643\u064e\u062a\u064f\u0648\u0633 Ketos, The Whale.\n\u039a\u1fc6\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, Cetus.\n\nThe Arabic name of this constellation, which comprises twenty-two stars, is evidently derived from the Greek \u03ba\u1fc6\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2; our globe furnishes the names of three stars only. To those in the head the name 'the Maimed Hand' has been assigned, because, according to Kazvini, they cover a smaller space than the Dyed Hand in Cassiopea. The five stars in the belly are called the Ostriches; and the star in the southern part of the tail the second Frog, in opposition to the first Frog in the sign of the Water Carrier.\n\n34. \u0627\u0644\u0628\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0627\u0631 The Giant.\nOrion.\n\nOf the thirty-eight stars composing this constellation, six only are named on the globe. The three stars in the face are denominated the White Speck on the Horse's foot; they form also the fifth mansion of the moon. The large and bright star on the left shoulder is called the Shoulder, \u03a9\u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1 \u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd; that on the right shoulder, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0632\u064f\u0645 the Lion (?); and the large and bright one on the left foot \u0631\u062c\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u0632\u0627 Rigel-ul-Joza, the Giant's Foot; which has given rise to the denomination of that star, common among European astronomers, Rigel.\n\n35. \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0647\u0631 The River.\n\u03a0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2, Amnis, Eridanus.\n\nIt is formed by thirty-four stars. Its extremity is called \u0627\u062e\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0647\u0631 the End of the River, \u1f18\u03c3\u03c7\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u1fc6\u03c2; which has been corrupted into Acarnar, and passed over into our astronomical tables.\n\n36. \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0646\u0628 The Hare.\n\u039b\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03c2, Lepus.\n\nThis constellation contains twelve stars, according to Kazvini; of which the four in the belly and the two in the hind feet (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4) are called \u0643\u0631\u0633\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u0632\u0627 the Throne of the Giant.\n37. \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0644\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0643\u0628\u0631 The Greater Dog.\n\n\u0391\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03ba\u03b9\u03ce\u03bd, Canis.\n\nIt has obtained its name, according to Kazvini, on account of its following after the Constellation of the Giant like a dog. One large bright star in the mouth bears the name of the Star of Yemen, in consequence of its setting in the direction of this country. Chrysococces renders the Arabic word into \u03a3\u03b9\u03ac\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f30\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03ae, in conformity with another and more common name Sirius; which seems to have been sacred to the Egyptian goddess Isis, from an inscription copied by Diodorus from a column, in which she says of herself: \u1f18\u03b3\u1f7c \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u1ff7 \u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u1fd6\u1ff3 \u03c4\u1fc7 \u03ba\u03c5\u03bd\u03af \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9, \"I rise in the constellation of the Dog.\" Four stars, one of which is situated in the shoulder, another in the tail, and the other two (\u03b4, \u03b5) between the tail and the thigh, bear the common name of the Virgins; which word, on the globe, is engraved across the belly of the animal. The star in the left shoulder is called \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0632\u0645\u0646. Under the figure, there are six single stars denominated the Solitary.\n\n38. \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0644\u0628 The Dog.\n\n\u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03ba\u03cd\u03c9\u03bd, Procyon.\n\nThis constellation has only two stars belonging to its figure. The brighter one is called \u0627\u0644\u0646\u062c\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0629 or \u0627\u0644\u0646\u062c\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0629 (which latter is on the globe) the Syrian Star, thus denominated on account of its setting in the direction of Syria. The star on the shoulder is known by the name \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0632\u0645\u0646.\n\n39. \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0641\u064a\u0646\u0629 The Ship.\n\n\u039b\u03ad\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd, Argo, Navis.\n\nIt numbers forty-five stars. The bright and large star on the southern oar is called \u0633\u064a\u0641, \u039a\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2, Canopus.\n\n40. \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u062f The Hydra.\n\n\u1f59\u03b4\u03c1\u03b1, Hydra, Anguis.\n\nIn this constellation we find three stars only named on the globe: \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u06a9, the Solitary, is the name of the star situated at some distance under the head of the animal; and \u0639\u0646\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u062f, the Hydra's Neck, that of the one in the neck near the first convolution of the body, as in Ulugh Beg. Near the constellation of\nthe Censer we read the word \u0627\u0644\u0634\u064e\u0631\u0650\u064a\u0641\u064f, the Ribs, evidently applied to several stars, as we are entitled to infer from its position.\n\n41. \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0627\u0637\u064a\u0629 The Flaggon.\n\u039a\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2, Crater, Urna.\n\nThis constellation comprises seven stars, but exhibits the name of none on the globe.\n\n42. \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0631\u0627\u0628 The Crow.\n\u039a\u03cc\u03c1\u03b1\u03be, Corvus.\n\nIt numbers seven stars; two of them, the one lying in the body, the other in the foot, are called \u062c\u0633\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0645\u0643 the Throne of the Simak.\n\n43. \u0642\u0646\u0637\u0648\u0631\u0633 The Centaur.\n\u039a\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, Centaurus.\n\nThis constellation, consisting of thirty-seven stars, exhibits but two names on the globe. The pair of stars, one of which lies in the right foot and the other in the left, are together called \u062d\u0636\u0627\u0631 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0632\u0646 and also \u0645\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0641\u064a\u0646, which, however, does not appear on the globe.\n\n44. \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064e\u0645\u0652\u062d The Beast.\n\u0398\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03bd, Fera.\n\nThis contains nineteen stars, some of which are common both to it and to the Centaur, who holds the fore-foot of the Beast in his hand. The stars of the two constellations united are called \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0645\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062e the Branches or Clusters of Dates, on account of their numbers, and being crowded together.\n\n45. \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062c\u0645\u062f\u0629 The Censer.\n\u0398\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd, \u0398\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, Thuribulum.\n\nIt embraces seven stars, but none of them are named on the globe.\n\n46. \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0643\u0644\u064a\u0644 The (Southern) Crown.\n\u03a3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c6\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, \u039f\u1f50\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03c9\u03bd, Caelulum.\n\nOf the thirteen stars forming this constellation, none are named on the globe.\nThe Southern Fish.\n\nIt comprises eleven stars, lying south of the Water Carrier.

On the Poetry of the Chinese.\u2014By John Francis Davis, Esq., F.R.S., M.R.A.S.\n\nRead May 2, 1829.\n\n\"Qu\u00e6rere coepit\nQuid utile ferrent:\nTentavit, quoque, rem si dign\u00e8 vertere posset.\"\n\nHor.\n\nIn the arrangement of our subject, it may perhaps be useful to preserve so much regard to method, as to treat of it separately, under the two following heads:\n\nPart I. Versification, or the particular rules which prevail in the mere construction of lines, couplets, and stanzas; and the sources whence these derive their melody and rhythm.\n\nPart II. A general view of the style and spirit of Chinese poetry, the character of its imagery and sentiment, and the extent to which it seems to admit of a precise classification, relatively to the divisions and nomenclature adopted in European literature.\n\nTo such as should find the first portion of our treatise dry and technical in its details, the second may possibly prove more attractive: but the order of discussion could hardly be inverted with propriety.\n\nPART I.\n\nIn Chinese versification the following are the circumstances which seem chiefly to demand our notice: 1. The nature of the sounds of which\nthe spoken language consists, and the fitness of this for metrical composition. 2. The variation of certain tones, or accents, as prescribed by rule. 3. The use of poetical numbers, or measure. 4. The observance of a regular caesural pause, about the middle of each verse. 5. The use of terminal rhymes. 6. The rhythmical effect produced by the parallelism of couplets, which will be explained in its proper place.\n\n1. Of the sounds of the spoken language. The attention of curious persons may perhaps be excited to ascertain, what powers of melody can be possessed by a system of speech, which has been represented to contain merely about four hundred monosyllabic sounds. They may naturally enough imagine, that Chinese poetry must, in point of euphony, rank with those defective verses censured by our own great poet,\n\n\"Where ten low words oft creep in one dull line.\"*\n\nA summary disposal of the question, by assuming, at once, that it is a case in which melody is unattainable, has to be reconciled with the obvious fact, that the Chinese take a passionate delight in their poetry. Is it likely that so large a portion of the human race should have persisted in the enthusiastic cultivation of an art, which is essentially incapable of possessing that very charm, which everywhere else forms a main element of its attractiveness?\u2020 It has pretty generally gone abroad, that all the Chinese words are strictly monosyllabic\u2014which only proves that opinions, which\n\n* Low words, of any length, are certainly out of place in poetry: but that an English verse is much the worse for consisting of ten monosyllables, does not so clearly appear; and Pope's own poems abound in monosyllabic lines, as may be proved by the slightest examination. A few instances occur even of couplets so distinguished:\n\n'Ah, if she lend not arms, as well as rules,\nWhat can she more than tell us we are fools.'\n'Talk what you will of taste, my friend, you'll find\nTwo of a face, as well as of a mind.'\n'There are who have not\u2014and, thank heav'n, there are\nWho, if they have not, think not worth their care.'\n\n\u2020 A writer of the M\u00e9moires sur les Chinois asserts, that their poetry is susceptible of even imitative harmony, and this is no doubt true: but the instance which he adduces may perhaps make the reader smile. \"On vante,\" says he, \"l'harmonie imitative d'Hom\u00e8re. Elle est tr\u00e8s-famili\u00e8re \u00e0 la po\u00e9sie Chinoise: au lieu de dire, par exemple, on entend le bruit des tambours, le Chiking dit, 'On entend le tang-lang des tambours.' Cette citation n'est pas des plus heureuses, mais c'est la seule qui me vienne.\"\nnobody is particularly concerned in correcting, will sometimes pass current for a surprising length of time.\u2014Perhaps the circumstance of every word filling the same space in the page, has assisted to perpetuate the notion. It is the business of the present treatise, however, to state all that can fairly be said in favour of its subject; and, with the concurrent opinion of Dr. Morrison, we will endeavour to produce facts, and institute comparisons, which may tend to prove that a considerable portion of the Chinese words are not absolutely monosyllabic.\n\nSome of these, if expressed by the powers of the English alphabet, are written he\u016be, ke\u016ben, he\u016b\u0113, le\u0101ou\u2014every vowel being distinctly pronounced,\u2014and others cannot be properly expressed, except with the direct use of the diacresis, as l\u0113en, t'hi\u0113en, k\u0113\u0113, &c. Now, with respect to the latter of these, if the necessity for using such a mark were not, of itself, sufficient to prove that they are something more than mere monosyllables, the metrical examples of another language might serve to settle the point.\n\n\"Their fluid bodies half dissolv'd in light\"\u2014\n\"Like some gaunt lion in his gloomy lair.\"\n\nAny person who has been in the habit of hearing the Chinese pronounce their own language, knows that l\u0113en, s\u0113en, &c. are quite as dissyllabic as lion, fluid, and such other words, wherein no consonant intervenes between the two syllables. Similar examples, however, are by no means so abundant in our harsh modern languages, especially those of Germanic extraction, as in Latin and Greek, where almost every line of poetry teems with such vowel sounds; and where (at least in the latter) we constantly meet with three successive vowels, forming as many separate syllables\u2014the very circumstance which constitutes the ground of its superior melody.\n\nBut let it be objected, and let us admit for a moment (what in fact is not true), that in Chinese every word is pronounced in the same time, and therefore the above distinction signifies little. Does it, with reference to a sister art, make no difference in music, whether two or three notes be struck in the same measured time\u2014or only one? What but something very similar to this was the Greek and Roman practice, as far as we can understand it, of making two short syllables exactly equivalent to a long one, and pronouncing them in the same time. That such matters are not totally indifferent, might be proved by the trite example from Virgil\u2014the well-known verse, descriptive of an eager and restless horse, which derives its imitative\ncharacter from the rapid succession of dactyls: and again, by the opposite artifice, used by the same poet in painting the blinded giant, where the heavy spondaic measure of the line, joined to the redundant terminal syllables, is equally expressive in another way. The discussion of this point, however, is rendered somewhat superfluous by the plain fact, that all Chinese words are not pronounced in the same time. Of what are called the \"four tones,\" it is the professed business of the third to prolong, and of the fourth to shorten them.\n\nThe truth seems to be, that the language of China abounds in diphthongal at least, if not in triphthongal sounds, which contribute, when found blended with others that are more strictly monosyllabic, to give to its verse a certain share of varied euphony. There is no occasion to incur the charge of attempting to prove too much\u2014at the same time it does not seem very easy to shew, why such words as ke\u0101\u010d and ke\u0101ou, with every vowel clearly pronounced, should not advance nearly as good a claim to the title even of trisyllabic,* as those marked in the following examples, each of them consisting of as many metrical syllables as it has letters.\n\n\\[\n\\text{\u0391\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b4\u03ae, \u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03b1\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b7\u03c1\u03c4\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03af\u03bd\u03b1; \u03bf\u03af\u03bd\u2014}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{'\u03c0\u03b9\u03b5 \u03c3\u03cd \u03c4\u03b9 \u039c\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd\u03ac\u03b4\u03b7, \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u1f30\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03ad\u03c9\u03bd.}\n\\]\n\nNot only, however, do vowel sounds so extensively prevail in the language of which we treat, but the few consonants that are to be found in it are, almost without exception, free from the reproach of harshness. There is no terminal consonant whatever, except n and its nasal ng;\u2020 and the initials are only Ch\u2014F\u2014G hard\u2014H (if it may be called a consonant)\u2014J, soft as in French\u2014K\u2014L\u2014M\u2014N\u2014P\u2014S\u2014Sz\u2014Sh\u2014T\u2014Th\u2014Ts\u2014and Tsz. Of these, Tsz, and if you please Ts, are the only sounds which approach to the character of harshness. The Chinese find it no easy matter to pronounce English words; but Englishmen meet with little difficulty in pronouncing theirs\u2014the natural inference from which is, that our own language, though certainly more varied, is the harsher of the two.\n\nWe shall presently see that they possess the usual means, employed by other nations, to give harmony and rhythmical effect to their verse: but it\n\n* They might more strictly, perhaps, be termed triphthongal.\n\u2020 It must be kept in mind, that we here treat of the dialect of literature, and of educated persons. In the south of the empire, words end in k and t; but provincial corruptions and vulgarisms form no part of the subject.\nmay not be unimportant first to shew, that the native and original qualities of the language are such, as not to unsuit it altogether to the purposes of melodious composition,\u2014that the raw material is not unfitted for the manufacture. A notion seems to have existed, that the whole merit of Chinese poetry lay in some curious and fanciful selection of the characters, with a reference to their component parts. As a medium for the communication of ideas, the written language certainly differs from alphabetic systems: but, after all, the characters are the means only, and not the end. The melody of the sound\u2014the harmony of the structure\u2014and the justness of the sentiment, or beauty of the imagery\u2014constitute, as they do everywhere else, the merits of poetical composition.\n\n2. Such being the natural qualifications of the Chinese language, considered in its oral capacity, for poetry\u2014it derives cadence and modulation from the artificial use of the tones, or accents; which appear, however, to have been originally adopted for a very different purpose, and to have owed their existence, rather to the necessity of perspicuity in speech, than of melody in verse. It may easily be imagined, that where a whole spoken language consists of not more than about four hundred words of different sounds, there would be great danger of two interlocutors misunderstanding each other, from the unavoidable use of the equivoque; and hence the necessity for the tones, or accents, consisting of what may, in sufficient conformity with the meaning of their original names, be styled the even or natural, the acute, the grave, and the short. In point of fact, the first is no accent at all, but rather a negative quality\u2014the absence of all marked intonation; and accordingly the Chinese themselves call it ping, 'even or smooth,' while the three others they class together, under the general name of ts\u00e8\u00e8, 'deflected,'\u2014that is, deflected from the natural tone. These last are, in regular poetical composition, used indifferently for each other: they are considered as being opposed to, and required in verse to be alternated with, the even-toned or unaccented words. It would be quite unprofitable to dwell here upon their minute distinctions, or to endeavour to give particular description of them, because nothing but the mouth of a native can illustrate them properly: they are really\u2014vox et praeterea nihil, and have already been as fully noticed, as such a subject admitted of, by several writers on Chinese grammar. Suffice it then to say, that by their use the original sounds of the language are varied or multiplied about four-fold, and a great accession made to its fitness for metrical composition.\nOf a species of technicality which admits so ill of illustration on paper, it is enough to observe, that the words (we shall presently see that these are equivalent to feet in other languages) which answer to the even numbers in each line,\u2014the second, fourth, sixth, according to the length of the verse,\u2014together with the last word of all, are, in regular poetry, the subjects of attention with regard to the alternate position of the tones called 'natural,' and 'deflected.' The rule for placing them seems to have variety, or the avoiding of a too frequent recurrence of the same tone, for its principal object. Their attention to this point goes beyond the single lines, and extends to the couplets: for whatever the intonation of the second, fourth, or sixth words in the first line may be,\u2014whether natural or deflected,\u2014that of the corresponding words in the next line is required to be the opposite.\n\nM. Freret, in the M\u00e9moires de l'Acad\u00e9mie, fell into a great error, in asserting that 'les Chinois n'ont jamais connu la versification cadenc\u00e9e par l'arrangement de ces tons musicaux : leur po\u00e9sie a seulement \u00e9t\u00e9 consacr\u00e9e par le nombre des syllabes, et dans la suite on a y ajout\u00e9 la rime.' Even the most irregular species of Chinese verse, called Tsze, is to a certain degree regulated by the tones, though in a different manner from the foregoing.\n\n3. The next source of harmony that we have to notice, is the use of poetical numbers. Every word of Chinese poetry, instead of being regarded as a mere syllable, may more properly be considered as corresponding to a metrical foot in other languages. It has already been shewn, that a considerable portion are really dissyllabic\u2014and all of them are pronounced, in the recital of verse, with an emphasis and prolongation of the voice, very different from the manner in which we slur over the unaccented portion of our syllables.\n\nTo begin with the smallest number of words that form a measured line in Chinese, we sometimes meet with so few as three, repeated like a kind of 'refrain' in popular songs. This short measure also constitutes occasionally a species of chime for the inculcation of moral maxims; and it was, no doubt, for the similar purpose of assisting the memory, that it has been adopted in the composition of the San tsze king, or \"Trimetrical Classic,\"\u2014a work evincing considerable ingenuity, though intended for the humble purpose of conveying to youth the rudiments of general knowledge. In China, as elsewhere, persons of high attainments occasionally think it worth their while to devote their talents to the promotion of the great busi-\nness of education. The following lines are taken, as a specimen of this particular kind of verse, from that portion of the above work, in which the regular succession of all the dynasties, and most celebrated emperors, is turned into rhyme; and it may perhaps remind the English reader of a well known song, called the \"Chapter of Kings.\"\n\n**Trimeters.**\n\n```\n\u865f\u4e09\u570b \u9b4f\u8700\u5433 \u56db\u767e\u5e74 \u5149\u6b66\u8208 \u81f3\u5b5d\u5e73 \u9ad8\u7956\u8208\n\u8fc4\u5169\u6f22 \u664b\u9f0e\u737b \u70ba\u738b\u83bd\u696d \u6f22\u696d\u5efa\n```\n\n*Kaou-tsoo hing\u2014Han n\u00e9e keen,*\n*Che Heaou-ping\u2014Wong-mang tsuon:*\n*Kwong-woo hing\u2014Wei Tung-Han;*\n*Sze pih n\u00e9en\u2014Chung yu H\u00e9en:*\n*Wei, Sh\u00fch, Woo\u2014Tseng Han ting,*\n*Haou San-Kwo\u2014Heih leang Tsin.*\n\n\"Kaou-tsoo arose\u2014And the race of H\u00e1n was established,\nUntil the reign of Heaou-ping\u2014When Wong-mang usurped the empire:\nKwong-woo arose\u2014And established the Eastern family of H\u00e1n:\nAfter enduring four hundred years\u2014The H\u00e1n ended with H\u0153n-te:\nWei, Sh\u00fch, and Woo\u2014Contended together for the empire of H\u00e1n,\nThey were called the THREE NATIONS\u2014And continued till the rise of the two dynasties Tsin.\n\nThe line of *four* words is the shortest that seems ever to have been used in the higher species of composition. It constitutes the chief part of the measure of the sacred book of odes, called *Shee king*, the oldest poetical\nwork in China.* There, however, the measure of some pieces is altogether irregular, varying from three, to seven or eight words in a line. Poetry, in most countries, begins with being the vehicle of religion and morality, and the first record of historical facts. Venerated at first as the language of wisdom or inspiration, it is at length cultivated as a pleasurable art, and never fails to improve in harmony, however it may degenerate in other points, with the progress of time. \"Il faut distinguer dans la po\u00e9sie,\" says Racine, \"ce qui vient de la nature, et ce qui est ajout\u00e9 par l'art : la nature inspire d'abord la rapidit\u00e9 du style, et la hardiesse des figures ; l'art vient ensuite, et pour rendre le style po\u00e9tique encore plus rapide, et en m\u00eame temps plus harmonieux, le resserre dans les bornes \u00e9troites de la versification. La po\u00e9sie naissante n'a point du conno\u00eetre cet esclavage, puisque les r\u00e8gles de l'art ne s'\u00e9tablissent qu'avec le temps et la r\u00e9flexion.\" The earliest Chinese poetry, as we find it in the Sheeking, appears certainly to have made use of the embellishments of both measure and rhyme, but with a degree of irregularity very different from the polish of modern versification. The lines are occasionally of all lengths; and the rhyme seems to be subject to little rule. It will occasionally occur for six or eight consecutive verses, and there will sometimes be none at all. For the same reason that Pope is more harmonious than Chaucer or Donne, Boileau or Racine than Ronsard, Virgil or Tibullus than old Ennius,\n\n\"Sic horridus ille\nDefluxit numerus\"\n\nso the poetry of China, from the T\u00e2ng dynasty (when this art attained its highest perfection) down to the present time, is in point of mere versification a vast improvement on the Sheeking. It would be strange indeed, if this people were an exception to a rule so general; if an art, in which they took so much delight, had not improved by cultivation, or were, at the present day, devoid of so essential a qualification as the harmony of numbers. The old measure of four words, or feet, is now seldom adopted, being from its shortness unsuceptible of much melody. At the same time it does occasionally occur, chiefly for moral and didactic purposes; and the following may be taken as a specimen.\u2014They are some lines of the Buddhists.\n\n* For two of the most regular odes of this collection, vide infra, Part II.\nTETRAMETERS.\n\n\u4e94\u9ad4\u63a8\u50be\n\n\u4e00\u96dc\u65bc\u507d\n\n\u5584\u6027\u6839\u6210\n\n\u5929\u7406\u662d\u8457\n\n\u81f3\u8056\u81f3\u660e\n\n\u7121\u601d\u7121\u616e\n\n\u4e0d\u64fe\u4e0d\u9a5a\n\n\u9748\u54c9\u4e00\u9ede\n\nLing tsae yih teen\u2014Puh jaou, puh king;\nWoo sze, woo leu\u2014Che shing, che ming:\nTh'een le chaou choo\u2014Shen sing keu ching:\nYih ts\u00e4 yu wei\u2014Woo tee tsuy king.\n\n\"When the heart is enlightened by a spark of the aethereal intelligence,\nThere is neither perturbation, nor alarm;\nThere is neither thought, nor anxiety:\nBut all is moral perfection, and the complete radiance of truth:\nWhere the heavenly principle pours its light,\nThe root of a virtuous disposition is perfected:\nBut once mingling with human frailty,\nThe whole man will be subdued and overturned.\"\n\nThe improved system of versification consists in lines of five words or feet, as well as in the longer and still superior measure of seven.

In aid of the effect of metrical quantity, the Chinese possess another rule of versification, well known to Europeans, but which has never yet been noticed with reference to the subject of the present treatise. It may be premised, that no sentential pause ever occurs in the middle of a verse; at least, none which could be punctuated with any thing beyond a comma in English. Every line is complete within itself; there is nothing of what the French call enjambement. But while a reference to written poetry easily establishes this point, the writer of the present observations thought he could plainly perceive, in the correct recital of the longer measures by natives, a very marked caesural pause near the middle of the lines. Repeated trial tended to shew, that in verses of seven words, the caesura was invariably after the fourth\u2014and in those of five, after the second word. With a view to being quite clear upon this subject, reference was made to a gentleman, whose profound knowledge of the language renders him a very competent judge in all matters connected with it. He was soon\n\n* China was formerly divided into separate and independent states.\npersuaded of the existence of the fact; and a properly qualified native, being summoned into the room, was requested to read out the longer measures of verse in a slow and deliberate manner. The result was, that the caesura fell exactly in the places above-mentioned, being more strongly marked in some lines than in others, but still unchangeable with regard to position\u2014and the native himself (who, by the way, was a Sewtsae, i.e. had taken his degree) admitted that such was the case. While the long measures admit of, and in some degree require, this pause of the voice, all lines which contain less than five words appear, by reason of their shortness, to be entirely devoid of it.\n\nThe existence of the caesural pause in a particular part of each verse might, of itself, be considered as deserving of notice in a treatise of this nature: but the farther connexion that it has with the structure of the verse makes it still more worthy of attention. The language of China is in a great measure composed of what, for want of a better expression, we will call \"compound terms,\" consisting of two words or characters, which may be a noun with its adjective, a verb with its adverb, two nouns united\u2014and a great many other grammatical combinations of the kind. These are always pronounced together,\u2014as much so as parts of the same compound word in other languages. In a verse of seven words, the caesural pause being after the fourth, the first section of the line generally * consists of two of these compound terms. The fourth and fifth characters can never be coupled in this manner, because the pause cannot take place in the middle of a compound term\u2014but it must be the first and second, the third and fourth, which are thus related. This being the case with regard to the first section of the verse, the last, which contains three characters, is commonly a compound term, with the addition of a single word, which may either precede or come after it. But as this is a subject which may best be illustrated by examples, here follow some lines of seven words, in which the verbal construction can be observed\u2014together with the place of the caesural pause after the fourth word, as far as this may be shewn without actual recital.\n\n* Generally, because it is not meant to be asserted that Chinese verses are always, or entirely composed of such terms: they frequently contain a number of single characters, or simple terms; but whenever the others are used, their position in the verse is invariably as above stated.\nShe sze mang-mang\u2014woo leaou ke,\nHo seu koo-koo\u2014yung sin ke:\nTs\u00edn seay l\u00f3 choo\u2014ch\u00f4 pei tsew,\nTow ko iuen she\u2014soong show she.\n\nMing hwa puh fang\u2014puh seng fiang,\nMei yu puh mo\u2014puh seng kwang:\nPuh she yih fan\u2014han ch\u00e9 k\u00fch,\nTseng tih mei hwa\u2014p\u00f6 pe heang.\n\n\"The affairs of the world are all hurry and trouble\u2014without end:\nWhy then with bitter anxiety\u2014waste the heart's springs?\nSearch for some pleasant spot\u2014to pour out a cup of wine,\nSteal a leisure hour\u2014to sing the stanzas of an ode!\n\n\"The fine flower unblown\u2014exhales no sweets,\nThe fair gem unpolished\u2014exhibits no radiance:\nWere it not that once\u2014the cold penetrated its stem,\nHow could the plum-blossom\u2014emit such fragrance?\"\n\nWe next come to the line of five words, where the caesura falls after the second. Here the first division of the verse usually constitutes one compound term; and the last three words are subject to the same law as in the longer line. The following are examples.\nJin jin\u2014j\u00f3 koong tsun,\nKea ku\u00f3\u2014ho tae ping:\nFang che\u2014choong hae yu,\nKuong che\u2014sih keen koen.\n\nShan sih\u2014woo yuen kin,\nKan shan\u2014choong je hing:\nFoong lwan\u2014suy choo kae,\nHing kih\u2014puh che ming.\n\n\"The whole people\u2014unitedly obeying the laws,\nThe nation, as a family\u2014will rejoice in peace:\nPromulge it\u2014to the extremities of the ocean,\nExtend it\u2014to the foundations of the world!\n\n\"The tints of the hills\u2014are confounded in their distance,\nAs the traveller views them\u2014to the end of his daily journey:\nThe shapes of their peaks and ridges\u2014alter with every change of place,\nUntil the wanderer\u2014ceases to know their names.\n\nOur English verse of ten syllables derives great advantage from the power of varying its effect, without any prejudice to its melody, by occasionally shifting the place of the caesura,\u2014unlike the Chinese, where it is fixed and immovable. In this, however, the latter bears some resemblance to the French alexandrine, always divided into hemistiches by the caesural pause, with which the sentential pause is most commonly coincident*\u2014as well as to that law of the Latin hexameter, which seems to\n\n* 'Que toujours dans vos vers\u2014le sens coupant les mots,\nSuspende l'hemistiche\u2014en marque le repos.'\n\nBoull., Art Po\u00e9t.\ndemand, that in a line perfectly euphonic, the c\u00e6sura should fall after the first syllable of the third foot.*\n\n5. Of rhymes, it is chiefly to be observed, that they occur, in regular poetry, at the end of the alternate verses which answer to the even numbers,\u2014that is, at the termination of every second verse. The first one of all frequently gives the rhyme to the whole stanza; but the rest of the uneven numbered lines seem subject to no rule, and end with any sounds indifferently. The length of the stanza is determined by the recurrence of the same rhyme, and, in a poem of any continuity, it is generally of four lines only\u2014that is, a quatrain, whose second and fourth lines rhyme together; but occasionally it consists of eight verses, of which four have the same ending. Stanzas, however, or rather short pieces of poetry, are very common of twelve, and even sixteen lines, some of which might, with no great impropriety, be assimilated to what we call sonnets. In the stanza of four lines, it cannot be objected that the rhyme is too frequent; and even in that of eight, it should be considered, that only the second line of every couplet possesses the rhyme; while the intermediate ones are blank, and thus afford a relief to the ear. In our own Spencerian stanza, consisting of nine lines, no less than four of them have the same ending, that is, the second, fourth, fifth, and seventh\u2014while three others likewise rhyme together, the sixth, eighth, and ninth. The Chinese, however, do not seem to have a very nice ear for the perception of true rhymes; and this inaccuracy may partly arise from their not possessing such precise symbols, or marks of sound, as our alphabetic letters. In the odes of the Sheeking, as the lines and stanzas are occasionally extremely irregular in their length and general structure\u2014\"numeri lege soluti\"\u2014so the rhymes appear to be under no strict regulation. This seeming neglect may partly result from a change of pronunciation: but there can be little doubt that the subjection of rhyme to more rigid laws was, as well as the other improvements in versification, introduced in the general advancement of the art, under the T\u0101ng dynasty.\n\nThe following specimen affords an example of the rhymes in two stanzas of eight lines each.\n\n* 'Purpureus veluti \u2014c\u016bm flos, succisus aratro,\nLanguescit moriens \u2014lassove papavera collo\nDemisere caput\u2014pluvia cum forte gravantur.'\n\n3 G 2\nSTANZA I.\n\nSan-tung tsing-nwan hew,\nYih-yu ching seang-ee:\nMo-mo chin shan-k\u00f6,\nKing-king teen shih-che:\nChun foong yaou tang jih,\nWan-wuh fa-seng she:\nWei heang noong-jin shwo,\nSe-chow sze mo che.\n\n\"Felicitous Rains.\"\n\n1.\n\n\"The last month of winter was for the most part clear and mild,\nAnd now at length approach the well-timed showers:\nThe wide-spread mist has involved yon mountain dwelling,\nIts dews are slowly filling each rocky hollow:\nThe vernal winds obscure the clouded sun,\nIt is the season for all things in nature to germinate:\n\nSTANZA II.\n\nLew-sih wei chay king,\nTaou-hwa ee mwean lin:\nWuh yew lien ke how,\nWoo ke wong th'een-sin:\nYin ke jin koong-laou,\nShing-she leih wei jin:\nChae-mun tuy teh-leih,\nHing tso yih chin-yin.\"\nLet us convey an exhortation to the husbandman,\nThat he delay not the business of his western fields.\n\n2.\n\n\"The green foliage of the willows has not yet shaded the path,\nBut the peach-blossoms already cover the grove:\nEvery inanimate thing seems to feel the influence of the season,\nShall I then be unmindful of the purposes of heaven?\nLike some who lean on their tables, and grow unprofitably old,\nWho exert not their strength in the proper time:\n\u2014The rain falls in drops before my rude door-way,\nAs I stroll about, or sit, immersed in such meditations.\"\n\nRhymes, however, are by no means confined to regular verse (of which it is our particular business at present to detail the laws), being very apparent in the following citation, a species of composition called Tsze, something between prose and poetry, in which the rhyme is repeated at the end of lines of indeterminate length. The passage is descriptive of a field or bed of chrysanthemums, flowers which the Chinese admire on account of the brilliancy of their colours, and which they display towards winter in large quantities about their houses.\n\nSow ying mwan le, soo heang san king, shin-shin ts'en-ts'en hwong seang ying; loo hea tseih ying; ke ko tsan foong; yew hwong sih, shuey kan ping; ching tan taou ko l cn lae joo sin ping; yen-yen hae ch\u00fc tsew tsing sing; man yen tsin m\u00f6 ch\u00eb h\u00eben-h\u00eben; seu che she tsew Taou-kea hing.\n\n\"Their slender shadows fill the enclosure, and a scattered perfume pervades the flower-beds, planted in triple rows: their deeper and lighter tints reflect a yellow light,\"\nand the leaves shine varied from beneath the drops of dew; each hungry flowret inhales the passing breeze, as it sheds around its incomparable lustre. The gazer sympathizes with the languishing blossoms, bending their heads all faint and delicate: the mournful view awakes in his mind thoughts suitable to autumn. Say not that it is a sight to satiate the eyes of the indifferent beholder\u2014know that such flowers as these once inspired the poet Taou yuen ming,* as he indulged his genius amidst verses and wine.\"\n\n6. The next feature in the construction of Chinese verse is perhaps the most interesting of all, as it presents a striking coincidence with what has been remarked of the poetry of another Asiatic nation. In the preliminary Dissertation on Hebrew Poetry, prefixed to his translation of Isaiah, Bishop Lowth has treated at some length of a peculiar property which he calls parallelism. What this is, will be best explained in his own words.\n\n\"The correspondence of one verse or line with another, I call parallelism.\u2014When a proposition is delivered, and a second is subjoined to it, or drawn under it, equivalent, or contrasted with it, in sense, or similar to it in the form of grammatical construction, these I call parallel lines; and the words or phrases, answering one to another in the corresponding lines, parallel terms.\u2014Parallel lines may be reduced to three sorts: parallels synonymous, parallels antithetic, and parallels synthetic.\"\n\nThe first kind, Dr. Lowth defines to be those \"which correspond one to another by expressing the same sense in different, but equivalent terms: when a proposition is delivered, and is immediately repeated, in the whole or in part, the expression being varied, but the sense entirely or nearly the same.\"\n\nExamples.\n\n\"Because I called, and ye refused;\nI stretched out my hand, and no one regarded:\nBut ye have defeated all my counsel;\nAnd would not incline to my reproof:\nI also will laugh at your calamity;\nI will mock when your fear cometh.\"\n\n\"Bow thy heavens, O Jehovah, and descend;\nTouch the mountains, and they shall smoke:\nDart forth thy lightnings, and scatter them;\nShoot out thine arrows, and consume them.\"\n\n* For some account of Taou yuen ming, see M\u00e9moires sur les Chinois, torn. iii.\nThe reader is furnished below with examples from the Chinese, which will perhaps be considered as answering to the above description of the Hebrew\u2014with this only difference, that the peculiar structure of the language, of which we now treat, generally renders the parallelism much more exact, and therefore much more striking and obvious\u2014as it is usually word for word, the one written opposite to the other. The first two lines have a figurative reference to the perfection of a person's moral character.\n\nPih peih, woo hea, ching che paou,\nTsing luen, puh yen, fa k'he heang.\n\nSin taou lwan she, woo she choo,\nTsing tang koo tse, che sze pei.\n\nMo heen te tsih, yuen ting seaou,\nPuh yuen kea pin, hac'o ke wei.\n\n\"The white stone, unfractured, ranks as most precious;\nThe blue lily, unblemished, emits the finest fragrance.\n\n\"The heart, when it is harassed, finds no place of rest;\nThe mind, in the midst of bitterness, thinks only of grief.\n\n\"Be not discontented, though your land be narrow, and your garden small;\nBe not disturbed, though your family be poor, and your means contracted.\"\nThe second kind of parallelism is the antithetic, \"when,\" according to the definition of Bishop Lowth, \"two lines correspond with one another by an opposition of terms and sentiments.\" He observes, with reference to his own subject, that \"the degrees of antithesis are various, from an exact contraposition of word to word through the whole sentence, down to a general disparity, with something of a contrariety in the two propositions.\" It may be remarked, with regard to the Chinese, that the antithesis is commonly perfect, both in sentiments and terms.\n\nIt is farther to be observed, that the learned prelate takes most of his examples, under this head, from the Proverbs of Solomon, \"where they abound: for this form is peculiarly adapted to that kind of writing, to adages, aphorisms, and detached sentences.\"\n\n**Examples.**\n\n\"The memory of the just is a blessing;\nBut the name of the wicked shall rot.\"\n\n\"There is that scattereth, and still increaseth;\nAnd that is unreasonably sparing, yet groweth poor.\"\n\n\u2014As relates to the Chinese, the case is precisely the same, and no doubt for the same reason. In going over, by way of experiment, a collection of Maxims* compiled by himself, the writer of this immediately found that a very large portion answered to the foregoing description. For example:\n\n* Svo. London, 1823.\nY\u00f3 kwa, tsing shin shwong;\nSze to, heu\u0113 ke shwae.\n\nTsing pin chang l\u00f3;\nCh\u014d foo to yew.\n\nWuh e g\u014d seaou, urh wei che;\nWuh e shen seaou, urh puh wei.\n\nTsoong shen joo teng;\nTsoong g\u014d joo peng.\n\n\"With few cravings of the heart, the health is flourishing;\nWith many anxious thoughts, the constitution decays.\"\n\n\"Unsullied poverty is always happy:\nImpure wealth brings many sorrows.\"\n\n\"Consider not any vice as trivial, and therefore practice it:\nRegard not any virtue as unimportant, and therefore neglect it.\"\n\n\"Prosecuting virtue, is like ascending a steep:\nPursuing vice, like rushing down a precipice.\"\n\nBut the antithetic parallel is used not merely to give a force to aphorisms. It appears occasionally, though perhaps somewhat less often, in the course of poetry; and is found to exist in every degree, from the strong mutual opposition of all the corresponding words in a couplet, to that of only some of them.\nKwon seng joo kih, ke neng kew;\nSin sze yew ke, gan ko taou.\n\nSin king tsing she, shin ye tsing;\nYo seng hwan she ping seng she.\n\nYang meen, koong chang tan,\nTe show, luy shwong chuy:\nFoo hwee,\u2014tha jin tseu,\nPin han,\u2014tsin tsze le.\n\n\"Look on life as an uncertain guest, that cannot remain;\nBelieve that death is fixed, and cannot be escaped.\"\n\n\"When the region of the heart* is at rest, the body too enjoys ease;\nBut the passions being excited, then disorders of the body arise\"\n\n\"Supinely gazing, now I vent my sighs,\nNow, bending down, in tears my sorrow flows;\nThe wealthy alien claims connubial ties,\nThe needy kinsman no relation knows!\"\u2020\n\nThe third sort of parallel, noticed by Dr. Lowth, is what he denominates the synthetic, or constructive, where each word and line does not exactly answer to its fellow as either equivalent or opposite in sense: but where there is a marked correspondence and equality in the construction of the lines\u2014\"such as noun answering to noun, verb to verb, member to member, negative to negative, interrogative to interrogative.\"\n\nExamples.\n\n\"Is such then the fast which I choose?\nThat a man should afflict his soul for a day?\nIs it, that he should bow down his head like a bulrush;\nAnd spread sackcloth and ashes for his couch?\nShall this be called a fast,\nAnd a day acceptable to Jehovah?\"\n\nThis is by far the most common species of parallelism with the Chinese. Indeed the two first sorts, already described, are generally accompanied\n\n* Morally speaking, and meaning the mind.\n\u2020 The 'Heir in old Age,' page 9.\nby this last\u2014the correspondence of sense, whether it consist in equivalency or opposition, is almost always attended by correspondence of construction: the latter is often found without the former, while the converse seldom takes place. It pervades their poetry universally, forms its chief characteristic feature, and is the source of a great deal of its artificial beauty. In nearly every specimen produced in the course of this treatise, it may be observed to exist in a more or less marked degree, and unless for the sake of regularity, it would seem almost superfluous to adduce particular examples here. In the romance called Haoukewchuen, or the \"Fortunate Union,\" the first of the two following quatrains is introduced, in application to the hero, who is distinguished at once by his bravery and his abilities\u2014in the second example, it will be observed that the words are very nicely balanced.\n\nKoo hing puh wei, tseuen ping tan,\nLeng len keaou jin, yaou yew tsae;\nTan, sze Tsze-loong choong ch\u00fc she,\nTsae, joo Le-pih tsae seng lae.\n\nPih, ts\u00e9en, wan sze, ying nan leaou,\nWoo, lew, sh\u00e9 n\u00e9en, yoong e lae:\nT\u00e9 yih j\u00e9 h\u00e9en, h\u00e9en yih j\u00e9,\nYu san pei yin, yin san pei.\nThus alone and dauntless he walked\u2014all confident in his courage;\nThus proud and reserved\u2014he must needs possess high talents:\nCourage\u2014as if Tszeloong, the hero, had re-appeared in the world;\nTalents\u2014as though Lepih, the poet, had again been born.\"\n\n\"A hundred\u2014a thousand\u2014ten thousand projects are hard to accomplish;\nFive times\u2014six times\u2014ten years very soon arrive:\nWhen you have found a day to be idle\u2014be idle for a day;\nWhen you have met with three cups to drink\u2014then drink your three cups!\"\n\nThe constructional parallelism of sentences extends to prose composition,\nand is very frequent in what is called wun-chang, or fine writing, which is\na measured prose, though not written line beside line, like poetry. Indeed\nall the three kinds may be met with occasionally in every description of\nwriting that soars above the style of mere conversation or narrative. They\ndo not alone constitute poetry, which must have the several other qualifi-\ncations already mentioned, as measure, rhyme, &c.\u2014but being allied to\nart and embellishment, they claim verse as their proper province, and are\ncarried there to a greater degree of refinement than elsewhere. The three\nfollowing prose sentences, in which there is a parallelism throughout, com-\nbined with a sort of anti-climax, are introduced chiefly for the sake of\nnoticing a striking coincidence of sentiment, in a quarter where one is not\nprepared to meet with it, except in the case of the most obvious, simple,\nand general truths.\n\nShang pin che jin, puh keaou urh shen;\nChung pin che jin, keaou urh how shen;\nHea pin che jin, keaou urh puh shen.\n\n\"The highest order of men (called Shing, perfect or inspired) are virtuous, or wise,\"\nindependently of instruction:\u2014the middle class of men (H\u0113en, good or moral) are so after instruction\u2014the lowest order (Yu, stupid or worthless) are vicious in spite of instruction.\"\n\nThese three classes are, strange to say, most exactly defined in the following passage from the Works and Days of Hesiod*\u2014the sentiment could scarcely be more nearly rendered.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\text{\u039f\u1f54\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03bc\u1f72\u03bd \u03a0\u0391\u039d\u0391\u03a1\u0399\u03a3\u03a4\u039f\u03a3, \u1f61\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u1f10\u03bd\u03b8\u03b5\u03af,} \\\\\n&\\text{\u0395\u03a3\u0398\u0395\u039b\u039f\u03a3 \u03b4' \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, \u1f61\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f56 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c3\u03c0\u03c1\u03ac\u03c4\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b9\u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03bd,} \\\\\n&\\text{'\u039f\u03c2 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03ba\u03b5 \u03bc\u03b7\u03bd' \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03b9, \u03bc\u03b7\u03bd' \u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 \u1f00\u03ba\u03ad\u03c9\u03bd} \\\\\n&\\text{\u0395\u03bd \u03b4\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1 \u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u1fc6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, \u1f61\u03c2' \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4' \u1f08\u03a7\u03a1\u0397\u0399\u039f\u03a3 \u1f14\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nOf the different sorts of parallelism it is perhaps needless to observe, that in no other language could they be carried to such a height as they are in Chinese: the exact equality in the number of words, which form each line of a poetical couplet, and the almost total absence of recurring particles that encumber our European languages, admit of their being adopted with peculiar effect. There is something of an antithetic parallel in the two first lines of Horace's well-known apologue.\n\n\"Rusticus urbanum murem mus paupere fertur\nAccepisse cavo, veterem vetus hospes amicum.\"\n\nBut to make this resemble the arrangement of a Chinese couplet\u2014to make the antithesis sentential as well as verbal, it would be necessary to set prosody at defiance, and write the corresponding words opposite to one another, somewhat in the following way:\n\nRusticus mus, vetus hospes, accepisse fertur\nUrbanum murem, veterem amicum, cavo paupere.\u2020\n\nSuch refinements, though to some they may appear to savour of trifling, certainly contribute to heighten the peculiar rythmus of the poetry into which they are introduced, at the same time that they tend to increase its difficulties, and enhance the merit of the composition on the same principle that makes our neighbours, the French, so tenacious of rhyming\n\n* Edit. Robinson: page 146.\n\n\u2020 It is evident that this transposition ruins the peculiar beauty of expression in the Latin, arising from the immediate contiguity of the antithetic, or corresponding words in the same line, which would be impracticable in the Chinese\u2014a language entirely devoid of all inversion.\ntragedies, and the unities of the drama\u2014\"L'art en devient plus difficile, et les difficult\u00e9s vaincues donnent en tout genre du plaisir et de la gloire.\"\n\nThe Chinese are so fond of their parallelisms, that the most common decorations of rooms, halls, and temples, are ornamental labels hung opposite to each other, or side by side, and called Tuy-lien, which has precisely the meaning of the English term. These are sometimes inscribed on coloured paper, sometimes carved on wood, and distinguished by painting and gilding\u2014but always in pairs. They have generally an allusion to the circumstances of the dwelling, or of the inhabitant: and, by way of illustration merely, we might imagine some Chinese, who affected a just mediocrity in his desires and wishes, suspending on one side of his study a sentence which should have the meaning of\n\nCaret obsoleti sordibus tecti,\n\nand, exactly opposite to it, another sentence in as many words,\n\nCaret invidend\u00e2 sobrius aul\u00e2.\n\nThe two first of the following examples were supplied by the kindness of Dr. Morrison:* they were taken down by him, during our progress with the British embassy, in the interior of China. The last couplet I wrote down myself, on a visit to a native.\n\n* In conversing with Dr. Morrison on this property of Chinese verse, and remarking that it was common to other languages, he suggested my adding to the present treatise a close comparison (like the one which I have here instituted) with the instances adduced by Bishop Lowth from the Hebrew. For the hint, therefore, I stand indebted to him.\nMr. Davis on the Poetry of the Chinese.\n\nSoong-pih tsang Loong tseng han shang;\nWoo-tong tan Foong woo yun p\u00eben.\n\nL\u00eben t\u00e0 jin-tsing keae he\u00f2-wun;\nTong ming she-koo ts\u00eb\u00eb king-lun.\n\nHih-hih yew she hwan shuh-shuh;\nHe\u00ebn-he\u00ebn taou te shing laou-laou.\n\n\"From the Pine forest, the azure dragon ascends to the milky way:\nFrom the Dryandra cordata, the crimson phoenix aspires to the borders of the variegated clouds.\"*\n\n\"Experience and discernment of the human passions may both be called learning;\nDeep and clear insight into the ways of the world also constitute subtle genius.\"\u2020\n\n\"Fame and ambition themselves must have their intervals of repose:\nRetirement and leisure are, after all, preferable to labour and anxiety.\"\n\nPART II.\n\nThus much having been said concerning mere versification, or what may be styled the outward form of Chinese poetry, we have next to consider the spirit that animates it\u2014and to ascertain, moreover, under what separate classes this department of their literature may be properly arranged, when viewed in relation to the divisions and nomenclature of European criticism.\n\nIt is here deemed necessary to premise, that such a mode of treating our subject is not adopted with the desire, or indeed with much prospect, of discovering any great correspondence or resemblance: but the process of comparison, to whatever result it may lead, is always useful on such occasions. It serves to methodize and give clearness to our conceptions of a subject comparatively new, as the artist sometimes introduces into his sketch a few objects of known and determinate dimensions, to assist in con-\n\n* The dragon and phoenix are here typical of the prosperous man rising to high fame and honours.\n\u2020 Intended to shew, that true scholarship and genius are not confined to the mere knowledge of letters.\nveying juster notions of what he represents besides. On this occasion, too, it has another, and a peculiar use: for every thing concerning China stands unfortunately so insulated and remote from whatever generally constitutes a source of interest to Englishmen, that the only effectual way of attracting attention to it, is by bringing it in contact with objects nearer home, and thus allowing it to derive, from association, its fair share of advantage.\n\nUnless submitted with some degree of allowance to the touchstone of European taste, the poetry of China might possibly succeed but indifferently. The test, if it be not considerately applied, is not only an illiberal, but an absurd one; and we have no right hastily to condemn the devotion which the ultra-Gangetic muse (however foreign to ourselves may be her features and garb) inspires in her own native haunts; or to be surprized at the number of her exalted admirers, from Confucius down to Ke'enlong,\u2014considering that national taste is the most conventional and capricious thing in the world; that it is determined by the infinite varieties of national character, national models, and national associations; and that even with the same old copies to refer to, and with a general similarity of institutions and customs, the different nations of the great European community vary, on such points, not a little among themselves.\n\nScimus,\u2014et hanc veniam petimusque damusque vicissim.\n\nThere seem to be two causes, to which Chinese literature, of the lighter or ornamental kind, has owed its indifferent reception in the West\u2014first, a want of choice and selection in the subjects\u2014and secondly, a considerable absence of taste and judgment in the mode of treating them. It is really too much to expect that people will trouble themselves to look at what is either stupid and good-for-nothing in itself, or so marred in the intermediate process, as to have lost all the attraction that it possessed in the original state. Let us only place the Chinese in our own situation on such occasions, and imagine the dismay of some fastidious scholar who should unluckily stumble upon one of our street-ballads, done into bad Chinese, that is, with a verbal adherence to the original. It would either prove a perfect enigma, which is supposing the most fortunate case,\u2014or he would thank his stars that the broad-ocean divided him from such savages, and burn a supernumerary stick of incense before the shrine of his deified patron. The interests and reputation of Chinese literature in Europe therefore seem to demand, that its professors take some pains to render its introduction as attractive as possible, by a careful selection of the best subjects,\nand by treating these in such a manner as shall interest the greatest number of tasteful and cultivated readers. To weary the attention with a mere list of barbariphonous and uncouth names, to produce some bald and miserably verbal translation, to present the mere caput mortuum of something that in its original shape possessed spirit and beauty, is in fact scaring away attention from a new subject, which, with a little discretion, might be rendered sufficiently attractive even to general readers. With such considerations in view, we might look to the successful exploring of the Chinese mine, and to the extraction of the ore of genius and sense from the mass of baser matter in which it happened to be imbedded.\n\nWhenever a work of taste meets with universal approval in its own country, we may be assured that its success is in great measure owing to the merits of its style and language; and therefore it seems singularly injudicious to think of transferring the spirit and effect of such a Chinese composition into bad English, which it must inevitably become, by a servile adherence to the letter of the original. Between the greater number of European languages there is a certain connection, which allows literalness of rendering to be carried to a great extent\u2014but a verbal translation from the one concerning which we now treat, must of necessity degenerate into a horrible jargon, which few persons will undergo the disgust of perusing. These observations do not apply in the same manner to works of scientific or doctrinal detail, as to those of mere taste, whose end and aim is to convey pleasure, as well as instruction,\u2014though perhaps chiefly the first. A certain distinction, too, must be made between prose and poetry: the former doubtless both requires and admits of a closer rendering\u2014with regard to the latter, we may adopt the happy illustration used on a similar occasion, \"Celui qui pr\u00e9tendrait juger de quelque po\u00e8me que ce f\u00fbt dans une traduction litt\u00e9rale, pourrait aussi raisonnablement esp\u00e9rer de trouver, sur le revers d'une tapisserie, les figures qu'elle repr\u00e9sente dans toute leur d\u00e9licatesse et toute leur splendeur.\" Verse, then, must be the shape into which Chinese, as well as all other poetry, ought to be converted, in order to do it mere justice; though in the present treatise, where so many different pieces are introduced for such different purposes, it has been thought expedient to adopt by turns a prose translation, a faithful metrical version, or an avowed paraphrase, as might best suit the subject and the occasion. More has been deferred herein, than suited the writer's own judgment and\ninclinations, to the prejudices of those who are still partial to the literal side of the question.\n\nTo take up our subject at its commencement\u2014the earliest poetry of China, like that of all other nations, appears to have consisted in songs and odes, intended occasionally to be accompanied by music. Such is the nature of that curious compilation, made more than two thousand years since by Confucius, and illustrative of a state of things certainly very different from that which exists at the present day. It is divided into four portions, of which the first, the largest, and most interesting, is called Kw\u00f2 foong, \"the manners of different states,\"\u2014that is, of the states into which a portion of the present empire was then divided. These had all of them a kind of feudal dependence on one sovereign, who, in order to possess himself of the best means of estimating the character and sentiments of the various people more or less under his sway, was furnished with the songs and odes most popular among each of them. This agrees in a singular manner with the following remark of a writer in the Spectator.* \"I have heard,\" says he, \"that a minister of state in the reign of Queen Elizabeth had all manner of books and ballads brought to him, of what kind soever, and took great notice how much they took with the people; upon which he would, and certainly might, very well judge of their present dispositions, and of the most proper way of applying them according to his own purposes.\"\n\nThe bulk of these curious vestiges of antiquity in the Sheeking do not rise beyond the most primitive simplicity, and their style and language, without the minute commentary that accompanies them, would not be always intelligible at the present day. This commentary, however, explains and elucidates their meaning, and, by means of the historical associations which it serves to convey, renders these songs the favourite study of the better informed at the present remote period. Every well-educated Chinese has the most celebrated pieces by heart, and there are constant allusions to them in modern poetry and writings of all kinds. Each stanza frequently ends with a species of repetition, or 'refrain,' common to such compositions in general, and, in proof of the extreme simplicity of these primitive songs, one of them is presented below. In the paraphrase which follows, it has been necessary to embody the full sense of what is only hinted at\n\n* No. 502.\nin the original, and explained at length in the commentary; according to which commentary, the ode has a reference to the success of a rich and powerful suitor, who carries off the bride that had already been contracted to a humbler rival. The kieu, or robber-bird, is constantly alluded to in modern writing, as the emblem of unjust appropriation.\n\n\"The nest yon winged artist builds,\nThe robber-bird shall tear away:\n\u2014So yields her hopes th' affianced maid,\nSome wealthy lord's reluctant prey.\n\n\"The anxious bird prepares a home,\nIn which the spoiler soon shall dwell:\n\u2014Forth goes the weeping bride, constrain'd,\nA hundred cars the triumph swell.\n\n\"Mourn for the tiny architect,\nA stronger bird hath ta'en its nest:\n\u2014Mourn for the hapless, stolen bride,\nHow vain the pomp to soothe her breast!\"\n\nThe second and third parts of the ancient book of odes, called respectively Taya, and Seaouya, are said to have been composed for the purpose of being sung or recited on state occasions: they treat of the great and virtuous actions of heroes and sages, or express their sentiments.\nfollowing example, however, which is taken from the Seaouya, would seem rather to be of a more private description. It is explained as referring to the pain, felt by the poet, at the unworthy conduct of some ungrateful friend; and the allusions to the storm, &c. are of course figurative.\n\n```\nNow scarce is heard the zephyr's sigh\nTo breathe along the narrow vale:\nNow sudden bursts the storm on high,\nIn mingled rush of rain and hail.\n\u2014While adverse fortune louring frown'd,\nThan our's no tie could closer be;\nBut lo! when ease and joy were found,\nSpurn'd was I, ingrate\u2014spurn'd by thee!\n\nNow scarce is felt the fanning air\nAlong the valley's sloping side;\nNow winds arise, and lightnings glare,\nPours the fell storm its dreadful tide!\n\u2014While fears and troubles closely prest,\nBy thee my love was gladly sought;\nBut once again with quiet blest,\nThou view'st me as a thing of nought!\n```\n\"The faithless calm shall shift again,\nAnother gale the bleak hill rend,\nAnd every blade shall wither then,\nAnd every tree before it bend:\n\u2014Then shalt thou mourn thy lonesome lot,\nThen vainly seek the injur'd man,\nWhose virtues thou hadst all forgot,\nAnd only learn'd his faults to scan.\"\n\nThe fourth and last portion, of the ancient poetical classic, is called Soong, that is, eulogies or panegyrics on the ancestors of the dynasty Chow, then filling the throne, and on the great personages of antiquity. They appear to have been a species of hymn, sung before the emperor when he sacrificed as pontifex maximus, (which has always been the particular office of Chinese sovereigns) in the temples of heaven and earth, or in the hall of his ancestors. Whatever may be the real character of the Sheeking on the score of poetical merit, it is at least curious, as having been compiled more than twenty centuries prior to our time, and some portions of it composed at a still earlier date. A pervading characteristic of the whole, as might be predicted of the early poetry of every country, is the boldness and frequency of the figures which are introduced.*\n\nIt may be laid down as a rule, that every species of composition will be studied and perfected, in exact proportion to the estimation in which it is held, or the grandeur or interest of the occasions on which it is employed. When lyric compositions, like the odes of Pindar, and the Carmen Seculare, &c. of Horace, were displayed on great national and religious festivals\u2014or shone forth the subjects of public, or imperial patronage, they became objects to which the first geniuses of the age directed their efforts; and the perfection which they attained was commensurate with the esteem\n\n* One of the most striking examples appears as a quotation in Dr. Morrison's Dictionary, Part I. page 434:\n\n\"The royal legions were numerous and imposing;\nSwift, as if they flew upon wings;\nImpetuous, as a torrent or a cataract;\nFirm, as the base of a mountain;\nResistless, as the course of a river;\nForming an unbroken line, in matchless order;\nTheir motions inscrutable, their prowess invincible,\nThey proceeded to the conquest of the state Seu,\"\nin which they were held. In modern China, if odes are expressly composed for great court ceremonials, we have not yet met with any\u2014such ceremonials are frequently accompanied by music, but that there are words to the music has not been so clearly ascertained.\n\nThere is a common species of composition called Ke\u014d, which cannot be better rendered than by Song, or Rhapsody. Its structure is as wild as the thoughts and imagery which it generally contains, the lines being of every length, but distinguished by recurring rhymes at intervals. Here follows a specimen.\n\n\u4e07\u91cc\u5de1\u884c\u591a\u5c11\u51c4\u51c9\u9014\u8def\n\u60c5\u770b\u4e91\u5c71\u91cd\u53e0\u5904\u4f3c\u6211\u4e71\n\u6101\u4ea4\u5e76\u56db\u8fb9\u843d\u53f6\u54cd\u79cb\u58f0\n\u957f\u7a7a\u5b64\u96c1\u6dfb\u60b2\u786c\u9898\u8d77\u4f24\n\u5fc3\u4e8b\u6cea\u5982\u503e\u56de\u671b\u9a6c\u5d6c\u5761\n\u4e0b\u4e0d\u89c9\u6068\u586b\u81ba\u8885\u8885\u65cc\u65d7\n\u853d\u6b8b\u65e5\u98ce\u6447\u5f71\u5339\u9a6c\u5d0e\u5c96\n\u600e\u6682\u505c\u600e\u6682\u505c\u53ea\u89c1\u9ec4\u57c3\n\u6563\u6f2b\u5929\u660f\u51a5\u5ce8\u5d4b\u5c71\u4e0b\u706b\n\u4eba\u884c\u51b7\u96e8\u659c\u98ce\u6251\u9762\u8fce\n\n\"In my wanderings of a thousand leagues, how many mournful thoughts afflict me on the road\u2014I behold you cloudy mountains piled one upon the other,\u2014the emblems of my accumulated sorrows.\u2014Around me the dropping leaves produce an autumnal sound.\u2014In the vast expanse, the solitary wild-fowl adds to my silent grief\u2014I brood over my cares, and my tears descend.\u2014Looking back towards the base of Matuy Hill, an involuntary melancholy fills my breast\u2014I see the waving banners intercept the setting sun\u2014their shadows dancing in the breeze*\u2014My horse has stopped at the pre-\n\n* This alludes to a tragical event in history, which occurred at the above-mentioned place. The emperor Yuentsoong (A.D. 702) had a mistress named Yangkuei, who was discovered carrying on an intrigue with a Tartar prince or noble, called Ganloshan. The emperor abstained from punishing the guilty female, which led to remonstrances on the part of his ministers; but instead of attending to them, he complied with the request of Yangkuei, and\ncipitous turning\u2014Wherefore do we linger, wherefore do we linger\u2014There is nought but the yellow sand drifting around\u2014The sky is growing dark and gloomy\u2014Few are the passengers at the foot of yon arched mountain\u2014the cold rain, urged by the gusty wind, is driving in my face.\u201d\n\nPopular songs and ballads hold but a low rank in the literature of the country: and if we should even go so far as to include under this denomination the detached snatches of irregular verse (also called Ke\u014d) which are met with in their drama, the truth of the position would not be materially affected. The stage, and every thing pertaining to it, enjoys a lower estimation than in any part of Europe: and we may take occasion to notice in this place, that the Chinese cannot strictly be said to possess dramatic poetry, in the sense which the term bears among ourselves, who apply it to the whole of a dramatic composition, and chiefly to tragedy. They make no distinction between tragedy and comedy in their stage pieces, the dialogue of which is composed in ordinary prose; while the principal performer now and then chaunts forth, in unison with music, a species of song or \u2018vaudeville,\u2019 and the name of the tune or air is always inserted at the top of the passage to be sung. Here follow a few lines from the drama* called \u2018An Heir in Old Age.\u2019 The chief character in the piece, an old man who is anxious to obtain an heir before he dies, sets fire to his bonds of debt, hoping that such a sacrifice may induce the accomplishment of his wishes\u2014and when the papers are consumed he breaks out thus:\n\n\u201cDo\u2019st ask me why, by this rash hand,\nA treasure to the flames was given?\nWhy but t\u2019avert, ere yet too late,\nThe vengeance of offended heaven!\nFull sixty years, by various arts,\nFor wealth I\u2019ve toil\u2019d, without an heir:\nWho knows but heaven may yet relent,\nAnd listen to a suppliant\u2019s prayer!\u201d\n\ngave the Tartar a military command within his dominions. No sooner had the latter reached his destination, than he set up the standard of rebellion, and the emperor, hastily assembling a large army, and accompanied by his favourite Yangkuei, proceeded to meet him in Szechuen. When they had reached the base of the mountain Matuy, the soldiers mutinied, declaring that Yangkuei was the occasion of the rebellion, and demanding that she should be put to death before they consented to meet the enemy. The emperor was obliged to comply, and ordered her to be strangled on the spot\u2014but his subsequent grief for her fate was the cause of his own death.\n\n* London, 1816. French version, Paris, 1819.\nWhile it is true that the Chinese themselves made no distinction between comedy and tragedy, a translator from their language is still at liberty to apply those terms, according to the serious and dignified, or comic and familiar character of the composition which he selects. The writer of this has therefore not scrupled to give the title of tragedy to a rather favourable specimen of the Chinese stage, which he lately put into an English dress. In the unity of the plot, the dignity of the personages, the grandeur and importance of the events, the strict award of what is called poetical justice,\u2014nay, in the division into five principal portions or acts, it might satisfy the most fastidious and strait-laced of European critics. Love and war, too, constitute its whole action, and the language of the imperial lover is frequently passionate to a degree one is not prepared to expect in such a country as China. The nature of its civil institutions, and the degraded state of the female sex, might generally be pronounced unfavourable to the more elevated strains of the erotic muse. The bulk of the people, it might be thought, are too much straitened for the bare means of subsistence through the pressing demands of an excessive population, to admit of their lounging about and singing after the most approved manner of idle shepherds and shepherdesses; and the well-educated class, which comprehends almost all the higher ranks, or those in the employ of the government, too proud and unfeeling to make love the theme of their compositions, which are doubtless chiefly confined to moral and speculative, or descriptive subjects. The Drama in question, however, if it served no better purpose, might teach us not to pronounce too dogmatically on such points by reasonings a priori, but to wait patiently for the fruits of actual research and experience.\n\nIt has been observed in Part I. that the most flourishing era of modern poetry was under the T'ang dynasty. The most celebrated poet of that age was the renowned Letaepih, born in the province Szechuen, about A.D. 720. He is made to give the following account of himself in a play called the \"Golden Token,\" which the writer of this once thought of putting into English, but abandoned as deficient in plot and incident. \"When I was born,\" says the poet, \"my mother dreamed that the morning star shone upon her bosom, and hence called me Taepih, 'surpassing brightness:' when the Emperor Yuentsoong commenced his reign, I was admitted to an audience in the imperial hall, and conversed of state affairs: the son of heaven conferred on me a repast, and helped me with his own hand.\" The poetical character in China has of old been associated with\nthe liberal use of wine. Letaepih's intemperate propensities occasioned, it is said, his banishment from court; but he remained uncured, and at last fell overboard from the boat in which he was travelling, and was drowned. Any one who thought it worth his while to know more concerning this person, and some of his contemporaries, might find their lives (though without their poetry) given at some length by Father Amyot, in the fifth volume of the M\u00e9moires sur les Chinois.\n\nA number of esteemed collections, called T\u00e2ngshee, or 'Poems of the T\u00e2ng Dynasty,' are regarded, for the most part, as the compositions of Letaepih, and a few more of the better poets of that day. They contain many favourable specimens, evincing both taste and imagination, and the following passage may perhaps be considered as tolerable. A person fishing in a boat, upon a lake, is supposed to have been led, by the track of peach blossoms floating on the water, into a narrow creek, which he pursued to a distance, until he reached a place inhabited by beings who, from the primitive simplicity of their manners, seemed to have escaped, in that secluded retreat, the persecution of the celebrated tyrant Tsinchehwong, and to have had no communication with the rest of the world since. On his return from this little Chinese paradise, the adventurous boatman related what he had seen,\u2014or perchance only dreamed; but on attempting to find the place again, it had vanished. There is a neat allusion to the famous burning of the books by the tyrant's command.\n\n\u708a\u70df\u843d\u843d\u5c11\u4eba\u5c45\n\u98a8\u666f\u4f9d\u7a00\u592a\u53e4\u9918\n\u8349\u6728\u76e1\u751f\u7121\u7a05\u5730\n\u5b50\u5b6b\u5e38\u8b80\u672a\u71d2\u66f8\n\u72ac\u5420\u7d05\u96f2\u51fa\u8349\u5eec\n\u82e5\u4f7f\u6241\u821f\u80fd\u518d\u8fd4\n\u5341\u5e74\u4f59\u6b32\u6548\u70ba\u6f01\n\nVol. II.\n\"The Inlet of Peach Blossoms.\"\n\n\"Few were th' inhabitants of that fair dell,\u2014\nRemnants their manners were of other days,\u2014\nFlourish'd their fields in peace,\u2014no impost fell\nMidway check'd labour's fruitful course,\u2014the lays\nTheir children sung had 'scaped the general blaze:\nAdown the vale was heard the cock's shrill strain;\nThe watch-dog's voice welcom'd the morning rays;\nOh, could my bark those happy fields regain,\nLong years of toil I'd brave\u2014nor deem my labours vain.\"\n\nThe following specimen is from the same collection with the preceding. The value of timely showers, to which it alludes, can only be duly felt in a hot climate and a thirsty soil like the south of China, where, according to the common saying, \"Three days make a short drought\u2014five days a long one.\"\n\n\u82b1\u66c9\u6c5f\u91ce\u6f64\u96a8\u6625\u4e43\u767c\u597d\u96e8\u77e5\u6642\u7bc0\n\u91cd\u770b\u8239\u5f91\u7269\u7d30\u6f5b\u5165\u591c\n\u9326\u706b\u96f2\u7121\u8072\u751f\n\u5b98\u6fd5\u7368\u9ed1\n\u57ce\u8655\u660e\n\n\"An Evening Shower in Spring,\"\n\n\"See how the gently falling rain\nIts vernal influence sweetly showers,\nAs through the calm and tepid eve\nIt silently bedews the flowers:\n\n\"Cloudy and dark th' horizon spreads,\n\u2014Save where some boat its light is burning:\nBut soon the landscape's tints shall glow\nAll radiant, with the morn returning.\"\n\nThere exist abundant materials of poetry in what may be called the heroic ages of China, when she was divided into independent states, con-\ntending against each other for sovereignty. The following lines are supposed to have been written by a certain emperor to his victorious general, of whose successes in the south he had just heard. The third and fourth lines are transposed in our version.\n\n\u5927\u5c07\u5357\u5f81\u80c6\u6c23\u8c6a\n\u8170\u6a2a\u79cb\u6c34\u96c1\u7fce\u5200\n\u98a8\u5439\u9f09\u9f13\u5c71\u6cb3\u52d5\n\u96fb\u9583\u65cc\u65d7\u65e5\u6708\u9ad8\n\n\u201cServant, well done\u2014the erring south restor'd,\nBends to the prowess of thy glittering sword;\nHigh as the orbs thy light'ning standard gleams,\nThy drum's loud music shakes the mountain streams:\nAnd heaven's own race alights on earth again,\nThe foe to scatter to their murky den!\nKnow, when with pride thy glad return we hail,\n'Thy sovereign's hand shall loose his hero's mail!'\u201d\n\nNo composition, however, to which the name of Epic could properly be applied, has ever rewarded European research. Though poetry exists in some shape or other all over the world, the same universality hardly attaches to that modification of it which we style the Epopee: and, but for the two great prototypes of Homer, there seems to be no absolute necessity for supposing that it must have arisen, or at least been so frequent, in our western literature. It was confessedly in imitation of Homer\nthat Virgil wrote, and all subsequent epics have been more or less, in conception at least, if not in execution, imitations of these two, or of each other. Voltaire himself has informed us, that when he consulted the advice of a friend previous to composing his own poem, he met with no better encouragement than this: \"You undertake a work which is not suited to us\u2014les Fran\u00e7ais n'ont pas la t\u00eate \u00e9pique\"\u2014But without going farther for reasons, the first part of this treatise may perhaps have served to demonstrate, that the turn and construction of Chinese verse unfit it for such sustained compositions. To be esteemed good, it must be so highly elaborated, that the costliness of the material may place limits to the size of the structure. It would be a tremendous attempt to preserve such nicely balanced couplets through the slow length of an epic poem; not to mention, that when the task had been completed, it might weary the reader as much as it had disquieted the author, and bestow upon the first all the sleep of which it had deprived the second. The only long metrical narrations of the Chinese are some novels and licentious* pieces, in which the structure of the verse is altogether loose\u2014a sort of 'stans pede in uno' measure\u2014and devoid of those characteristics which constitute the chief merit of their poetry. Such compositions, accordingly, do not possess that degree of estimation, nor hold that rank in literature which, as we have before observed, is necessary to the due perfection of every department of the art.\n\nThere is another description of poetry which we should not look for in China, namely, the Pastoral,\u2014and for very obvious reasons. It has not only been the care of the government, from the earliest ages, to give every direct encouragement to agriculture, and to the production of food for man\n\n---\n\n* There never was any assertion more incorrect than this of Martinius, concerning the lighter poetry of China. \"Insunt iis qu\u00e6dam de amando, sed castitatem magis quam nostrorum poetarum mollitiam spirantia, magn\u00e2 decori ubique cur\u00e2.\"\u2014In translating the excellent prose romance of Haoukewchuen, otherwise unexceptionable, the writer of this was obliged to exclude two passages in verse, which were distinguished\u2014\"minim\u00e2 decori cur\u00e2.\" There are whole poems of the same description.\n\n\u2020 Those half-mechanical conceits, of which the principal merit consists in the imitation, in tortured verses, of some object in art or nature, as a knot, a circle, a sceptre, &c. are well known to the Chinese: but sound taste and real genius have universally consigned these difficiles nug\u00e6 to a very low rank in literature, and we therefore abandon them without further notice.\nalone, but there have always existed some absurd prejudices and maxims, not to say positive laws, against an extended consumption of flesh food.* The penal code denounces severe punishments against those who kill their own cattle without an express license.\u2020 It is a well known principle, that where tillage exists to a considerable extent, the rent of land reserved for pasture must, in proportion to its goodness, be equal to that of land employed in producing grain; and this, under a rice cultivation, where three crops per annum are said sometimes to be obtained, must have such an obvious effect in raising the comparative price of meat, as must necessarily discourage its consumption among so frugal a people as the Chinese, even without the intervention of any positive law. There is accordingly no people in the world (the Hindoos \u2021 always excepted), that consumes so little meat, or so much fish and vegetable food\u2014nor, again, is there any country in which fewer cattle are employed for the purposes of draft and burthen. Where every institution tends so fatally to keep a population up to the very utmost limits of a bare subsistence, and where neither pride nor prejudice steps in between the labourer and his work, human exertion naturally supplants every other. In the southern parts of the empire, therefore, beasts of carriage and draft, with the exception of a few miserable riding horses, and a few buffaloes for ploughing, are nearly unknown. Towards Peking, and the uncultivated borders of Tartary, the case becomes altered: but the Great Wall may still be considered, generally, as the boundary which separates two people, one of them exclusively pastoral, and the other as exclusively tillers of the earth.\n\nThe esteem in which the business of tillage is held, may be expected to have rendered it the subject of poetical celebration: and we find the praises of fertile fields sung in such strains as the following. Years of dearth they term 'years of nothingness.'\n\n* See a long paper, 'Sur l'usage de la viande en Chine.' M\u00e9moires, T. xi.\n\n\u2020 Book iv. sect. 233.\n\n\u2021 Bishop Heber's Journal proves that the Hindoos themselves are not so scrupulous as they have been supposed. They consume milk, too, which the Chinese, strange to say, never think of.\n\"Fields that know no years of Dearth.\"\n\n\"Though man's superfluous labour ceas'd to till\nThe fertile glebe, ne'er would its bounties end:\nThough rusting lay the abandon'd ploughshare\u2014still\nO'er the fair land would waving harvests bend.\n\n\"Less happy soils may pine in years of dearth\u2014\nLate though we sow, we early reap the field;\nA thousand roods of richly-teeming earth,\nIn verdant crops ten thousand measures yield!\n\n\"Why haunt we, then, the sylvan's mossy shrine\u2014\nWhy ask what harvest shall our toils attend?\nSee the sweet spring with surer presage shine,\nAnd balmy airs, and length'ning days descend!\"\n\nWe have next to notice a large class of poetry, which may be properly styled Moral or Didactic. The long citation from the philosopher Kwon-\nfootszee, given by Dr. Morrison at p. 147 of the Third part of his Dictionary, comes under this head. It commences thus:\n\n\"Venerate heaven and earth: perform the rites to the gods;\nWorship your ancestors: be dutiful to your parents:\nObserve the laws: revere your teachers and superiors,\nLove your brothers: and be true to your friends,\" &c.\n\nThe whole piece bears some resemblance to the Golden verses of Pythagoras, particularly in the commencement, which may be thus literally rendered:\n\n\"First, as the laws ordain, th' immortal gods\nWorship: observe your vows: the great of yore\nNext, and the manes of the dead revere:\nHonour your parents, and your next of kin,\" &c.\n\nThere are innumerable poems, or rather metrical essays, whose object it is to convey the doctrines and precepts of the great national sages and others. The whole of the well-known work called Shingyu, or Instructions addressed to the people by the second Emperor of the present Tartar family, has been cast into a short, chyming verse. The example, given in Part I. at page 401, comes likewise under this head; as do all the similar productions of the Budhists, and other sects. We must consider them as forming a portion of the national literature in the gross, although they have nothing to do with Confucius or his doctrines, and are commonly held by the privileged learned in as great contempt as the superstitions to which they pertain.\n\nIn the course of their lighter works, Chinese writers frequently introduce moral reflections in verse with very good effect. A couplet, a quatrain, or a passage of eight or more lines agreeably engages the reader's attention in his progress through a romance or novel, and generally accompanies the transition to some other part of the story. They are not altogether unlike the rhymes at the close of the scenes in our older plays, and usually consist, as those did, of some reflection upon what has gone before, or what is immediately to follow; though in a narrative they certainly find a more proper place than in the drama, and are not there subject to the reproach of bad taste, which has very properly excluded such passages from our own modern stage pieces. Here follow examples from the \"Fortunate Union.\"\n\"Vain are the crafty villain's wiles, most vain,\nOften, when vaunted most\u2014disgrace, defeat,\nRush headlong in from quarters little fear'd!\nHearken to counsel, friend, and when secure\nYou deem yourself from mortals' purblind eyes,\nThink there's a heaven above, that surveys all!\"\n\n\"Human events in quick vicissitude\nSucceed each other: but true friendship's ties\nGain strength from time! Ask ye why sovereign heav'n\nThus vexes mortals?\u2014'Tis to try their hearts\nLike metal in the fiery crucible.\"\n\nSatire, viewed as a means of recommending virtue by discrediting vice, cannot be said to exist in any regular form, or to constitute a particular branch of literature. Some of the ancient pieces in the Sheeking have been considered as levelled at persons existing when they were composed; but they have no more claim on this account to the name of satires, than Horace's ode \"In M\u00e6vium.\" There is no country, at the same time, in which anonymous lampoons, and similar vehicles of invective or ridicule, are more common. They form one of the most ordinary outlets for the ebullitions of public feeling: and must be considered, by every person who\nhas had opportunities of making the observation, as a very important check, under so absolute a despotism, upon the conduct of Chinese rulers. The highest officers of government are not exempt from these covert attacks, which are constantly made, notwithstanding the severest punishments in case of detection.\n\n\u2014 \"I will ease my heart,\nAlthough it be with hazard of my head.\"\n\nThe following are specimens of satirical passages introduced in the course of a novel, to ridicule the worthless characters, both male and female.\n\n\"He thought his flattering phrases needs must prove\nWelcome\u2014nor dream'd of foul repulse and shame:\nAnd had not bounteous heav'n his forehead arm'd\nWith impudence unmatch'd, this keen rebuff\nHad stung him!\n\n\"In pearls and gold all gorgeously attir'd,\nNo arts could deck her native ugliness!\nThe demon king might view her as his own\u2014\nShe carried terror to a bridegroom's eye!\"\nWe now proceed to consider a very extensive department of Chinese poetry, the Descriptive, which to us strangers must be the most agreeable of all, and which really possesses some attractive features. The whole language abounds in figurative expressions, derived from the most pleasing or most striking objects and circumstances in nature. Thus 'Spring dreams and autumnal clouds' mean flitting visions of happiness\u2014unattainable good is represented by 'the moon's reflection in the wave'\u2014'floating clouds obscuring the day' express the temporary shade thrown by detraction on illustrious characters\u2014difficulty of acting is figured by 'the grass and tangle in one's path'\u2014female beauty by the obvious and common semblance of 'a fair flower'\u2014'spring' is the emblem of joy, 'autumn' of sorrow\u2014gladness is expressed by 'the heart's flowers being all full-blown'\u2014the virtue of the female character is pictured under 'the white gem, the pure crystal, the cold and transparent ice'\u2014'the season when peach-blossoms are in beauty' means that of marriage, because marriages were anciently celebrated in spring\u2014searchers after pleasure are depicted under the figure of 'bees and butterflies among flowers'\u2014and so on without end.\n\nThere exist a great number of figurative allusions, which contain a particular reference to some event in history or romance; and as the facts, or fables, at which these only hint, cannot sometimes be discovered without the assistance of a well-informed native, this circumstance constitutes a considerable obstacle, in the present state of our knowledge, to the successful study of Chinese poetry, anywhere but in the country itself. The following are examples of such allusions. 'The heart that responds to the lute,' means yielding to seductive arts, and refers to the story of a young damsel named Wunkeun, who being beloved by a youth called Szema, was serenaded by him on the lute, with a song called Foong kew hwong, or the \"Bird foong in search of its mate.\" The story says that Ke sin tong, 'her heart was moved,' and she eloped with her admirer towards morning, leaving the traces of her flight along the dewy pathway.\n\nA grateful return for benefits is implied under these expressions:\u2014'The spirit which knit the grass'\u2014and 'the bird that brought the yellow flowers.'\n\n1. An emperor of the dynasty called Chow, enjoined it on his son and successor to bury alive, after the old Scythian or Tartar fashion, one of his favourite mistresses in the same grave with himself. The son, however, refrained from executing this portion of the imperial will, on the ground\nof its cruelty, and gave away the lady in marriage to a noble. On making war against the state called Tsin, the new Emperor was opposed by a formidable leader; but he dreamed at night that he saw the deceased father of the lady he had saved from death, who told him that in return for the life granted to his daughter, he would assist him against the enemy. The result proved the vision to be prophetic\u2014the hostile leader was defeated, and some invisible agent so twisted the long grass which impeded his flight, as to cause his capture. 2. A person who saw a bird fall to the earth, wounded by an arrow, had the humanity to draw out the weapon, and restore the bird to liberty as soon as it recovered. Being soon afterwards sick and in danger of his life, the bird appeared to him, bearing in its bill some yellow flowers, which the patient was advised to try, and which presently restored him to health.\n\nThe poetry of China is not unsupplied with mythological aids: every element of nature,\u2014with all the phenomena that these exhibit,\u2014each hill, stream, and wood, has its presiding spirit. There is Hwuyloo, the monarch of fire; Luykoong, the thunder god; Luhshin, the spirit of the autumnal wave,\u2014and others innumerable. An interesting divinity, called Yu\u00eblaou, 'the old man of the moon,' deserves some notice. It is his peculiar business to tie together at their birth, with an invisible silken cord, all youths and maidens who are predestined for each other, after which the most distant separation, and apparently insurmountable obstacles, cannot prevent their ultimate union. This is what is called yewyuen, 'having a connection in fate.' With such a variety of imaginative resources, and with some of the brightest leaves of the book of nature, displayed to them in an immense tract of country, surpassed by none in natural advantages, this people would be dull indeed if they could not turn to some account the materials which they possess.\n\nThe muse, too, may call to her assistance the smaller race of fairies or sprites, who are supposed to haunt the recesses of hills and woods, and to exercise either a benign or a malicious influence over mortals. Possessing but a vague notion of the ideas which the Chinese really entertained of these imaginary persons, the writer of this applied for information to his Seenseng (or pundit, as such a character would be called less far to the east), and the reply was to this effect. \"They are mysterious beings who convert themselves at will into the semblance, sometimes of beautiful wo-\nmen, at others of ugly monsters,\u2014in infinite variety. They delight most in frustrating the attempts made by the devotees of F\u00f6, or Budha, to reach a superhuman state, and whenever these chance to waver the least in their faith or practice, they become immediately possessed (ch\u00f4 leaou moo), that is, the malicious spirits acquire a dominion over them.\u201d Being asked if he believed in their existence, he seemed rather unprepared to answer, but observed, that they possessed the greatest influence over the minds of the country people, and the devotees of the superstition above-mentioned. It may be noticed, that Confucius neither gave the express sanction of his opinion to the existence of unembodied spirits, nor did he expressly deny the same: but transmitted these early traditions of his country exactly as he found them; busying himself chiefly with the more important concerns of political government and morals.\n\nSeveral of the pieces already given might be arranged under the descriptive class. The following quotation from a novel called the \u2018Dreams of the Red Chamber,\u2019 is rather a poetical account of a young Chinese profligate, although it consists of a very irregular species of verse, in six and seven words. The version below is lineatim, and almost verbatim, and pretends to nothing more than a very close adherence to the sense of the original; which, it must be remarked, is not an extract from a long poem, but one of those poetical breaks, with which prose works of taste are generally embellished.\n\n\u7121\u6545\u5c0b\u6101\u8993\u6068\n\u6709\u6642\u4f3c\u4fca\u5982\u72c2\n\u7e31\u7136\u751f\u5f97\u597d\u76ae\u56ca\n\u4e00\u8178\u539f\u4f86\u662f\u83bd\n\u6f66\u5012\u4e0d\u901a\u5eb6\u52d9\n\u611a\u9811\u6015\u8b80\u6587\u7ae0\n\u884c\u70ba\u504f\u50fb\u6027\u4e56\u5f35\n\u90a3\u7ba1\u4eba\u9593\u8ab9\u8b17\n\"The paths of trouble heedlessly he braves,\nNow shines a wit\u2014and now a madman raves:\nHis outward form by nature's bounty drest,\nFoul weeds usurp'd the wilderness, his breast;\nAnd bred in tumult, ignorant of rule,\nHe hated letters\u2014an accomplish'd fool!\nIn act deprav'd, contaminate in mind,\nStrange! had he fear'd the censures of mankind.\n\nTitles and wealth to him no joys impart\u2014\nBy penury pinch'd, he sank beneath the smart:\nOh, wretch! to flee the good thy fate intends,\nOh, hopeless! to thy country and thy friends!\nIn uselessness, the first beneath the sky,\nAnd curst, in sinning, with supremacy!\nMinions of pride and luxury, lend an ear,\nAnd shun his follies, if his fate ye fear!\"\n\nThe language of descriptive poetry exists in every intermediate gradation, from the perfectly formed couplet and stanza, to those figurative compositions, which differ from prose in little else than the brilliancy of their imagery, or the elevation of their sentiment. Besides the T'sze, of which an example has been given in the First Part (page 409), there is a still less\nfettered species\u2014a kind of impassioned prose, into which the writer of a narrative now and then breaks forth, when inspired by the occasion. The following example is taken from the romance of the 'Fortunate Union,' and describes the heroine when she is first seen by her future lover. The parallelisms are marked and divided by colons in the translation.\n\n```\n\u5a07\u5a9a\u5982\u82b1\u800c\u808c\u819a\u5149\u8273\u7f9e\u707c\u707c\u4e4b\n\u6d6e\u83ef\u8f15\u76c8\u4f3c\u71d5\u800c\u8209\u6b62\u5b89\u8a73\u7b11\u7fe9\u7fe9\u4e4b\u5931\u63aa\u7709\u756b\u6625\u5c71\u800c\u6de1\u6fc3\u591a\u614b\n\u89ba\u6625\u5c71\u4e4b\u6709\u6127\u773c\u6a2a\u79cb\u6c34\u800c\u6d41\u8f49\u751f\u60c5\u602a\u79cb\u6c34\u4e4b\u7121\u795e\u8170\u7e96\u6b32\u6298\u7acb\n\u4ead\u4ead\u4e0d\u6015\u98a8\u5439\u4fca\u5f71\u96e3\u63cf\u9db4\u766f\u766f\u6700\u5b9c\u6708\u7167\u9aee\u5149\u53ef\u9451\u4e0d\u5047\u5857\u818f\u79c0\n\u8272\u582a\u6ba2\u4f55\u9808\u81bf\u7c89\u6167\u5fc3\u6084\u6084\u8d8a\u63a9\u8d8a\u9748\u671b\u800c\u77e5\u5176\u70ba\u4ed9\u5b50\u4e2d\u4eba\u4fe0\u9aa8\n\u4e4b\u79c0\u6167\u6027\u862d\u5fc3\u521d\u53ea\u7591\u7f8e\u4eba\u984f\u8272\n\u73e0\u5713\u7389\u6f64\u4e45\u65b9\u77e5\u541b\u5b50\u98a8\u6d41\n```\n\n\"With the delicacy of a flower, her complexion displayed a clear brilliancy which put to shame the floating light of day: with the buoyant lightness of the swallow, her movements were ordered with inimitable grace and propriety. The arches of her brows were like the outlines of the vernal hills in the distance, but in their changeful expression they shamed the varying tints of even the vernal hills; the brightness of her eyes equalled that of the clear wave in autumn, but the living sentiment which flowed from them made you wonder how the autumnal wave had lost its deity.* Her waist, like a thread in fineness, seemed ready to break, yet was it straight and erect, and feared not the fanning breeze: the shadowy graces of her person it was as difficult to delineate, as\n\n* Called L\u00fchshin.\nthe form of the white bird, rising from the ground by moonlight. The natural gloss of her hair resembled the bright polish of a mirror, without the false assistance of unguents: her face was perfectly lovely in itself, and needed not paint to adorn it. The native intelligence of her mind seemed to have gathered strength from retirement, and beholding her, you might know she was of a superior order of beings: the cold and rigid strictness of her manners, severe as she herself was soft and delicate, proved her to be no ordinary inhabitant of the female apartments. Her sweet and feminine disposition, comparable to fragrant flowers, might lead one at first to class her with other fair ones: but the perfection of this pearl, the polish of this gem, discoverable on a longer acquaintance, proved that she possessed qualities not inferior to the most spirited of the opposite sex.\"\n\nUnder the descriptive class may be properly introduced a very singular production,\u2014a poem on London, composed by a Chinese who visited England about the year 1813. Some notice of it appeared, for the first time, in the Quarterly Review for 1817; but as the present opportunity admits of the translation being accompanied by the original, no apology perhaps is needed for the insertion of the whole poem, notwithstanding its length, considering that it is a native of the remotest shores of Asia who sings the glories of the British capital\u2014'pr\u00e6sertim cum omne studium atque omne ingenium contulerit Archias ad populi Romani gloriam laudemque celebrandam.'\u2014The reviewer made a trivial mistake in stating that it was written by 'a common Chinese,' for the author was in a respectable station of life, and a person of good acquirements, who accompanied home an English gentleman as his instructor in the language. He was in fact a very uncommon Chinese, inasmuch as he appears to have possessed an inclination and capacity for observation by no means usual among his travelled countrymen, who are generally of a class much inferior to himself. The remarks are, as might be expected, confined exclusively to objects which at once strike the eye, and they do not extend to the remoter points of intelligent investigation, since the author's very limited knowledge of our language, and total inability to comprehend the nature of our institutions, placed such higher objects entirely out of his reach. Being a simple description, the poem contains but few flights of fancy; and as it would be a hopeless attempt, however well they may sound in Chinese, to give dignity in verse to matters so perfectly domestic and familiar to ourselves, it has been judged best to subjoin a literal prose translation.\n\"London, in Ten Stanzas.\"\n\n1.\n\n\"Afar in the ocean, towards the extremities of the north-west,\nThere is a nation, or country, called England:\nThe clime is frigid, and you are compelled to approach the fire;\nThe houses are so lofty, that you may pluck the stars:\nThe pious inhabitants respect the ceremonies of worship,\nAnd the virtuous among them ever read the Sacred books:\nThey bear a peculiar enmity towards the French nation,\nThe weapons of war rest not for a moment (between them).\"\n2.\n\n\"Their fertile hills, adorned with the richest luxuriance,\nResemble, in the outline of their summits, the arched eye-brows (of a fair woman).\nThe inhabitants are inspired with a respect for the female sex,\nWho in this land correspond with the perfect features of nature:\nTheir young maidens have cheeks resembling red blossoms,\nAnd the complexion of their beauties is like the white gem:\nOf old has connubial affection been highly esteemed among them,\nHusband and wife delight in mutual harmony.\"\n\n3.\n\n\"In the summer evenings, through the hamlets and gardens beyond the town,\nCrowds of walkers ramble without number:\nThe grass is allowed to grow as a provision for horses,\nAnd enclosures of wooden-rails form pastures for cattle.\nThe harvest is gathered in with the singing of songs:\nThe loiterers roam in search of flowers without end,\nAnd call to each other to return in good time,\nLest the foggy clouds bewilder and detain them.\"\n4.\n\n\"Their theatres are closed during the long days;\nIt is after dark that the painted scenes are displayed:\nThe faces of the actors are handsome to behold,\nAnd their dresses are composed of silk and satin:\nTheir songs resound in unison with stringed and wind instruments,\nAnd they dance to the inspiring note of drums and flutes:\nIt constitutes the perfection of harmonious delight,\nEvery one retires with a laughing countenance.\"\n\n5.\n\n\"The two banks of the river lie to the north and south,\nThree bridges interrupt the stream, and form a communication.\nVessels of every kind pass between the arches,\nWhile men and horses pace among the clouds:\nA thousand masses of stone rise one above the other,\nAnd the river flows through nine channels:\nThe bridge of Loyang, which out-tops all in our empire,\nIs in shape and size somewhat like these.\"\n6.\n\n\"It is a rich, populous, and highly adorned land,\nIts workmen vie with each other in the excellence of their manufactures.\nWithin the circuit of the imperial residence is a splendid palace;\nLofty trees are immingled with unnumbered dwellings.\nThe young gentry ride in wheel-carriages and on horseback,\nAnd the fair women clothe themselves in silken garments:\n*The space in each street being devoted to ornament,\nWhere is there room for the mere useful productions of the earth?\"\n\n7.\n\n\"The towering edifices rise story above story,\nIn all the stateliness of splendid mansions:\nRailings of iron thickly stud the sides of every entrance,\nAnd streams from the river circulate through the walls:\nThe sides of each apartment are variegated with devices;\nThrough the windows of glass appear the scarlet hangings:\nAnd in the street itself is presented a beautiful scene,\nThe congregated buildings have all the aspect of a picture.\"\n\n* Literally, \"Every street being devoted to flowers and willows,\nWhere is there space to plant mulberries and hemp (to produce silk and flax)?\"\n\u2014There are explanatory notes, and a commentary, in the original, which we have not thought it necessary to give here.\n\"In London, about the period of the ninth moon,\nThe inhabitants delight in travelling to a distance:\nThey change their abodes, and betake themselves to the country,\nVisiting their friends in their rural retreats:\nThe prolonged sound of carriages and steeds is heard through the day:\nThen in autumn the prices of provisions fall:\nAnd the greater number of dwellings being untenanted,\nSuch as require it are repaired and adorned.\"\n\n\"The spacious streets are exceedingly smooth and level,\nEach being crossed by others at intervals:\nOn either side perambulate men and women,\nIn the centre career along the carriages and horses:\"\nThe mingled sound of voices is heard in the shops at evening:\nDuring midwinter the heaped-up snows adhere to the pathway:\nLamps are displayed at night along the street sides,\nWhose radiance twinkles like the stars of the sky.\"\n\n\"The climate is too cold for the cultivation of rice,\nBut they have for ages been exempt from the evils of famine:\nWith strong tea they immingle rich cream,\nAnd their baked wheaten bread is involved in unctuous lard.\nHere excellent meats are served in covers of silver,\nAnd fine wines are poured into gem-like cups:\nThe custom of the country pays respect to the ceremony of meals,\nPrevious to the repast, they make a change in their vestments.\"\n\nOf a similar description with the stanzas on London is another poem,\nnot concerning the English exclusively, but Europeans in general, com-\nposed by a Hong merchant who has been dead some years. This person,\nnotwithstanding his unpoetical profession, was possessed of very respectable\nliterary acquirements, and one of his sons held a high rank in the imperial\ncollege at Peking.\u2014\" After an intercourse of thirty years (to use his own\nexpressions), which had made him tolerably familiar with the peculiarities\nof foreigners, he had retired, stricken in years, into solitude, and amused\nhimself over his cups (like Letaepih, of course) in composing a score of\nstanzas commemorative of some strange customs and opinions prevailing\nbeyond the seas.\"\u2014The production corresponds with its title, Seyang ts\u00e2h-\nyoong, \"Unconnected Stanzas on Europeans;\" and, after the perusal of the\nforegoing description from a person who had viewed us at home, may be deemed curious, as depicting the estimate formed of us by one who had never left his own country. With that want of minute discrimination which might be expected under such circumstances, the verses treat chiefly of those leading features which are common to all nations wearing hats and coats, and mingle, together with the rest, the Roman Catholic ceremonies of the Portuguese at Macao. Being less interesting to Englishmen than the poem which has already been given at full length, it may suffice to present an abstract of whatever observations it contains most deserving of notice.\n\nThe retired Bard commences with lauding the good faith of the foreigners, who \"make use of no formality, in their most extensive bargains, more solemn than a mere shake of the hand,\" and proceeds to hint, in the next verse, that \"the simple virtues of barbarians have been the subject of praise from the oldest times.\" It is quite true that commercial transactions of the largest description are frequently conducted at Canton on the mere faith of promises; and the good poet had never been in the way of seeing our legal stamps and parchments at home, which might have gone far to make him withdraw his last compliment.\n\n\"When a guest arrives, the host helps him with his own hand to the juice of the grape,\"\u2014and it is added in a note, \"they welcome visitors with wine, and not with tea,\" which is the Chinese fashion. \"To touch glasses in drinking is a mark of friendship. In winter evenings they sit by the fire and pour out cold wine, careless of the snows which lie deep beyond the door.\" In China they always warm their wine.\n\n\"They make light of their lives,\" it is observed, \"on occasions of personal contest, and when two of them quarrel, the consequences may be very serious. They stand face to face, and discharge fire-arms at each other on a given signal.\" In a note it is said, \"If one fall, the survivor is not punished: if neither fall, there is an end of the quarrel.\" \"They do this,\" adds the poet, \"to shew that they are not afraid,\u2014and so forth.\"\n\nOur author marvels much at the comparatively late period at which Europeans marry, but endeavours to explain it in this way. \"Their distant voyages abroad keep them long from home, and it is not until they have accumulated a fortune that they return to take a wife. Many do not marry before fifty years of age; and if the bride be very young on these occasions, it is no scandal.\" The knowledge of the worthy Hong merchant on this subject seems to have been much on a par with that of the St. Helena\nlady, who asked if London were not thrown into a great bustle by the arrival of the India fleet.\n\n\"In the regulation of the annual period, they have no intercalary moon, but the new year always commences ten days after the winter solstice. On this occasion they powder their heads with white dust, and all get tipsy.\" This evidently refers to good old times, and to manners now gone by. The author himself adds in a note: \"This habit has of late years worn out.\"\u2014There is a variety of other detached observations, less worthy of notice, and the poem concludes with mentioning, that \"the foreigners had been fighting together for some twenty years; but it was to be hoped they would soon make peace with one another, and all have an opportunity of improving themselves by an intercourse with China.\"\n\nA retrospect of our subject might tend to shew, that the poetry of China most naturally arranges itself under three general heads. 1. Odes and Songs.\u20142. Moral and Didactic Pieces.\u20143. Descriptive and Sentimental. These different kinds are, however, so blended together occasionally, and run so much into one another, that it is not always very easy, nor indeed perhaps is it of much consequence, to separate them. It has been remarked before, that as the substance and dialogue of their drama is always in prose, and the musical parts come properly under the definition of songs, the Chinese cannot with strictness be said to possess what we mean by dramatic poetry, that is, tragedies or plays of any kind composed mainly in verse.\n\nAt the end of this treatise will be found a miscellaneous selection of poetical pieces, extracted at random; and for the satisfaction of those who may prefer such a mode, they are accompanied, not by metrical versions, but by prose translations, as literal as they could be well rendered;\u2014although it must always be kept in mind, that this is a most disadvantageous dress for the poetry of any language whatever.\n\nIn thus coming to a conclusion, the author feels himself bound, as well for the sake of the subject, as his own, to notice the manner in which Professor R\u00e9musat, of Paris, has done him the honour to quote his opinion regarding Chinese poetry. In the preface to his translation of the Yu keaou le, when treating of the passages in verse with which that novel is interspersed, and of their frequent obscurity, M. R\u00e9musat observes, \"Le traducteur des Nouvelles dont j'ai pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment fait mention, assure que les vers dont il s'agit sont principalement destin\u00e9s \u00e0 flatter l'oreille, et que le sens y est tr\u00e8s souvent sacrifi\u00e9 \u00e0 l'harmonie.\" Now the passage to\nwhich M. R\u00e9musat alludes is the following, and it confines itself so expressly to the musical, or operatic portions of the drama, that it would seem impossible to extend its application either to novels, or to any other part of Chinese literature. \"A considerable portion of the plays of the Chinese consists of a sort of irregular verse, which is sung, or chaunted with music. This is often very obscure in its import; and as, according to the Chinese themselves, the gratification of the ear is its main object, sense itself appears sometimes to be neglected (not sacrificed), for the sake of a pleasing sound.\" That this is really the case, as regards the songs of the drama alone, is proved, as well by the verbal testimony of natives, as by the following passage from the preface to the \"Hundred Plays of Yuen,\" which refers chiefly to stage rules.\n\n\"Although the words may be wrong, provided that the laws of sound and cadence be not violated, there is no harm done:\u2014generally speaking, the study of the tune, or air, must be the first consideration, and the knowledge of the part (or r\u00f4le) the second.\" This is all extremely possible, and finds a parallel in our own opera and stage songs, some of which are sufficiently insignificant, and intended merely as pegs to hang musical notes upon\u2014but that he should ever have said any thing so extravagant regarding poems which are addressed expressly to the eye and the understanding, and to them only, the writer of this must utterly disclaim. As M. R\u00e9musat could not have intended to misrepresent his meaning, he feels persuaded that the quotation was made from memory.\n\nSince it would appear, then, that Chinese poetry generally has a meaning, although this meaning may not always be very easy to arrive at,* some effectual means of increasing our acquaintance with it is perhaps one of the greatest desiderata in eastern literature. It is very easy to \"harden ignorance into contempt,\" and to assume that whatever is unknown is not worth knowing: but the excellent use which has already been made of oriental thoughts and imagery, derived from languages of Asia more familiar to us, might encourage some extension in the range of our enquiries. Fruits of the highest culture may be improved and varied by foreign grafts; and as\n\n* 'La langue po\u00e9tique des Chinois est v\u00e9ritablement intraduisible; on pourrait peut-\u00eatre ajouter qu'elle est souvent inintelligible.'\u2014M.

Memoir on the Diplomatic Relations between the Courts of Delhi and Constantinople in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries.\u2014By the Chevalier Joseph de Hammer, F.M.R.A.S., Oriental Translator to the Emperor of Austria, &c. &c.\n\nRead January 2, 1830.\n\nThe first intimation of any intercourse by embassies between the courts of Dehli and Constantinople occurs in the reign of Suliman the Lawgiver, in the year 1586; when Burh\u0101n, the son of Sikandar, the king of Dehli, sought refuge at the Ottoman Porte from the displeasure of Humayun. In Ferdi\u2019s excellent history of Sultan Suliman\u2019s reign is the following account of this event:\n\n\u201cBurh\u0101n Beg, the son of Sikandar, king of Hindustan, ruined by the invasions of the Jagata\u00efan armies, fled to the Sublime Porte; where he was honoured by being allowed to kiss the imperial hand, and was provided with a daily pension of three hundred aspers.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, an embassy from the prince of Guzerat appeared at the court of Suliman, soliciting aid against the increasing power of Humayun Shah. The same Turkish historian mentions it in the following words: \u201cThe Tartar armies of Humayun, with which he had conquered the greatest part of Hindustan, having also taken possession of the countries of Bahadar Shah, Sultan of Guzerat, this prince sent away his principal ministers, his harem, and his treasure to Medina; and at the same time despatched an ambassador to Constantinople with presents, who arrived there while the sultan was absent at Adrianople. Besides other precious gifts, he brought a girdle valued at sixty crores of ducats, the crore being an hundred thousand; or taking the ducat at fifty aspers 30,000,000 aspers. Bahadar Shah having been killed soon after by the Portuguese,* Suliman, pasha of Egypt, sent to the imperial treasury three hundred iron chests, deposited at Mecca, and full of ducats\n\n* Manuel de Faria y Sousa\u2019s Portuguese Asia, vol. i., chap. 8, where Bahadar is changed into Badiro, and Humayun into Omaun.\nand jewels, the property of Bahadar Shah; which may, in a great measure, account for the subsequent magnificence of Suliman's court. Twenty years afterwards, letters were sent from India to Constantinople by the Turkish captain Saiy\u0101d Ali Katibi; who, after being shipwrecked in the Persian Gulf, proceeded overland to Constantinople, and delivered the letters with which he was entrusted for Suliman by certain Indian princes.\" One of these letters is given in the journal of Suliman's campaigns;* and Saiy\u0101d Ali Katibi's journey is already well known by the notice given of it in the first volume of the Transactions of the Literary Society of Bombay, and a translation lately published in the Journal Asiatique of Paris, from the German of Diez.\n\nDuring the reigns of the succeeding Sultans until that of Murad IV., there is no trace in the Ottoman histories of any intercourse whatever with the Indian courts; till, in the year 1632, the Prince Baisanghar arrived at Constantinople. In the annals of Naima, printed at Constantinople in the year 1732, this event is fully related as follows:\n\n\"Arrival of Prince Baisanghar.\n\n\"At the end of the year A.H. 1042 (A.D. 1632), came the Indian prince, Baisanghar, to rub his forehead on the imperial gate: and at the beginning of 1043, he established himself at Scutari. The detail of his history is as follows: After Timur's usurpation of the thrones of Iran, Turan, and Hindustan, his family continued to reign in those countries; but, in process of time, Iran having been conquered by the Redheads (Kuzul-bashis), of the dynasty of the Suffis, and Turan by the Greenheads (Uzbegs), the family of Timur was reduced to the occupation of the throne of Hindustan alone. Muhammed Baber, the son of Omar Sheikh, resided, as king of Hindustan, at Agra. He was succeeded by his son Humayun; after whom, his son Jelaleddin Akbarshah ascended the throne, and ruled over Hind, Cabul, Candahar, Dehli, and the other provinces of Hindustan. His praises were sung by Sheikh Feizi, the Indian, and Newi Khamoshi. Akbar had three sons, Selim, Murad, and Daniel; the former of whom succeeded him under the designation of Jehangir, (Conqueror of the world). The princes, Murad, and Daniel (who is called by the Indians D\u0101nshah), died after their father; and the whole empire of Hindustan\n\n* Vide Appendix, No. I.\nwas thus centered in Shah Jehangir's hands, whose praises were sung by\nthe poets Urfi Shirazi and Talib Amili; and whose vizier, Khoja Jehan,\nhas been equally celebrated by the poets of his time. Shah Jehangir was\none of the greatest monarchs of the world. He had two sons, the elder\nShah Khosru Mirza: and the younger Shah Khurrum Mirza. The king\nentrusted to the first the government of Agra, and to the second that of\nBurhanpur; fixing his own residence at Lahore. Historians, who ex-\npatriate in the description of Lahore, assure us that it is larger than Con-\nstantinople; and praise its lofty palaces, and its handsome and well sup-\nplied markets. Akbar, during his life-time, had a great predilection for\nhis grandson, Khosru Mirza, the son of Selim, and nominated him in his\nlast will to the succession. Khosru, elated with such prospects, became\nan object of hatred to his brother Khurrum; and even during the life-time\nof his father, took no pains to conceal the secret wishes of his heart,\nbut rebelled against him. Squandering away the treasures collected at\nAgra, he assembled a great army and took the field; but was beaten by\nthe troops of Selim, sent against him, and fled. He reached the borders\nof the river of Sind called Makran, which is as large as the Nile of\nEgypt; but being there overtaken by his pursuers, he was seized, put on\na camel, and conveyed to the king's presence. The governor of Burhan-\npur sent a message to his father, begging that his rebellious brother might\nbe delivered to him, and secured in prison. Selim in reply, expressed\nhis fears that he would put him to death; but the prince having pledged\nhis word to the contrary, he consented at length to send him; and no\nsooner was he arrived at Burhanpur, than he was put to death by his\nbrother Khurrum, in violation of the pledge he had given; who then him-\nself hoisted the standard of rebellion, and collected troops and arms.\nThe inhabitants of Burhanpur, disapproving of this conduct, shut the\ngates of the town against him; boasting of their attachment to the Shah,\nwho was at the time absent on an expedition against Cashmir and Kabul.\nKhurrum besieged the city for a year. Two principal emirs, faithful to the\ncause of Selim, defended it bravely; and the prince, being forced to\nraise the siege, retired towards Bengal. Having arrived on the banks of\nthe river Sind, he pitched his tents opposite to those of his father, who\nhad arrived with some troops on the other side of the river, which sepa-\nrated the two armies. They carried on the war for some time; the\nprince's army opposing the passage of his father's troops. At last Selim,\nat the head of the royal army, forced the passage of the river with his elephants, and gave battle to his son, who was defeated, and fled to Bengal; from whence, having collected fresh troops, he returned to the siege of Burhanpur. During this time some events took place which would be too long to relate. Finally, a peace between the father and son was brought about by the intervention of some well-intentioned persons, and Shah Selim granted pardon to his son, and conferred upon him a government. He died after a reign of thirty years, and Shah Khurram ascended his father's throne as king of Hindustan, when he assumed the title of Shah Jehan. Soon after, certain persons presuming to advocate the claim of one of the sons of prince Daniel to the crown, the King became incensed against them, and ordered them, five in number, to be put to death. Four of them were killed; but the fifth, Prince Baisanghar, avoiding the snare laid for him, fled into Persia; from whence (not having been well received there) he came on to Constantinople, to seek refuge in the presence of Sultan Murad IV. Not being aware of the ceremonial required in the royal presence, and boasting of his lineage and descent, his pride displeased the imperial temper of the Sultan. A sum having been granted him to defray the expenses of his journey, he distributed it as he came out from the audience, amongst the agas, baltajis, and porters. This having been reported to the imperial ear, he was little regarded on account of this stupidity. He even went so far as to boast, in the Sultan's presence, of his ancestor Taimur, and to allude to him by the title Saheb Kerani (lord of the auspicious conjunction). He was always followed by a servant, who carried the hide of a hart, and spread it for his master to sit upon. This stupid and uncomely behaviour was the cause that the sultan left off rising on the prince's arrival, and had no desire whatever to see any more of him. The prince continued nevertheless to solicit the aid of an army from the sultan, to seat him on the throne of India. Murad observed in private to his confidant, 'Shah Khurram has twice sent us envoys with splendid presents, and has in no wise been deficient in demonstrations of sincerity; but besides this, there is no motive for undergoing the hardships of a long march with a large army into so distant a country: and even were it as easy as it is difficult, we know too well Baisanghar's incapacity; were he to be established, by assistance, on the throne, it is evident that he would soon be stripped again of his artificial robe of sovereignty; according to the verse:\n\n\"If heaven grants to you the vest,\nWhere is the body, to be drest?\"\n\"With this verse the sultan concluded his speech. The prince went away in disgust; some say he turned dervish, but it is not known with certainty what became of him.\"\n\nFrom this passage of Naima two things are evident; one, that previously to Baisanghar's appearance at Constantinople, envoys had been sent from Kh\u016brrum Shah to Sultan Mur\u0101d; though no particular mention is made of them in the annals of the Ottoman empire. The other, that there were five sons of prince Daniel; of whom four were killed, and the fifth escaped: though Dow (at the end of the sixth chapter of the reign of Jehang\u012br) mentions but two. Sultan Mur\u0101d having alluded to two embassies as sent by Kh\u016brrum Shah, that of M\u012br Zar\u012bf, the first of which any mention occurs in Dow, must necessarily be the third. Naima, the Turkish historiographer, gives the following account of it.\n\n\"Arrival of an Indian Envoy in the year 1048 (A.D. 1638).\n\n\"A letter of Afrasiab Aghl\u016b had acquainted the Sultan that M\u012br Zar\u012bf, the envoy of Kh\u016brrum Shah, the P\u0101dshah of Hindustan, had landed in the port of Jedda.\n\n\"His Majesty being then at Mousul, the envoy proceeded thither, and delivered his letters and presents. Amongst these was a girdle valued at 15,000 piastres, and a shield made of an elephant's ear, covered with the hide of a rhinoceros, which could not be penetrated by sword or musket. The emperor, always slighting the greatest things, and eager to shew his athletic strength, called for a javelin; and the shield being placed on the ground, he pierced it so powerfully that the point of the javelin appeared on the opposite side. The envoy being much perplexed by this exposure of his boasting, the sultan ordered five hundred ducats to be put into the shield and carried to him. He had brought with him great wealth, to be distributed amongst the poor of Mecca and Medina. In his credentials it was intimated, that on the report of the sultan's march to Bagdad, the Shah of India had put himself in progress towards Candahar, and hopes were expressed that both countries would be conquered at the same time; which came indeed to pass, as will be related hereafter. The envoy was detained at Mousul till the conquest of Bagdad was effected, and handsomely provided for.\"\n\nMur\u0101d had less reason to be pleased with the letter than with the presents: it touched in an unpleasant way on the loss of Erivan, and on the sultan's last return to Constantinople, as being occasioned by internal broils;\nit insinuated that as a true Sun\u012b, and therefore a natural ally to the Shah of Hindustan, the sultan should remain in the next campaign a couple of years on his frontiers, either at Haleb or Adana, under pretence of ensuring the conquest of Bagdad.* The pride of Mur\u0101d and his ministers was exasperated at the tone of this letter, which was answered by one deficient in the courtesy usually observed in eastern courts towards great monarchs; and, as a counterpart to the proposition of spending a couple of years on the frontiers, it proposed that the Shah of India and one of his princes should first march into Candahar and Khorasan. Although this letter is nowhere to be met with in its original form and style, yet its contents are made perfectly clear from the next despatch of the Waz\u012br of Shah Jehan, who, according to the rules of Oriental official correspondence, recapitulating the contents of the letter, reproaches the Ottoman Grand Waz\u012br with this want of courtesy; and enumerates at the same time, the principal provinces of Hindustan. The bearer of this letter was the Turkish ambassador Arsl\u0101n Aga (the lion knight), of whose appointment and departure with the Indian ambassador a record is found to the following purport, in the history of Naima.\n\n\"Return of the Indian Envoy.\n\n\"It has been recorded above, that the Indian envoy was ordered to remain at Mousul till the affair of Bagdad should be accomplished. After the conquest, a messenger was sent to call him into the Sultan's presence; accordingly he rubbed his forehead on the imperial stirrup at Tacrit. Arsl\u0101n Aga, the chamberlain, was selected to accompany him on the Sultan's part; and he was sent on to the Grand Waz\u012br in order to be regularly despatched by him.\"\n\nArsl\u0101n Aga was detained at Agra till the news of Murad's death, and the accession of Ibrahim had reached India. He was then dismissed, without credentials or presents, from Shah Jehan to the new sultan; but merely with a letter from the Indian Grand Waz\u012br to the Ottoman one, of rather an insulting purport. This letter, preserved entire in the collection of state papers of the Reis Effendi Isari Abdullah, is a full proof of the incorrect-\n\n* This letter, which in its full extent is translated in the Appendix (No. 2), is taken from the valuable collection of state papers of the Reis Effendi Isari Abdullah.\nness of the statement in Dow's History,* where it is asserted, not only that Arslan Aga was himself presented with a sum of twelve thousand pounds sterling, but was also entrusted with rich presents for the Sultan. On the contrary, Arslan's return was distinguished in the most glaring manner, by the absence of all royal presents from the Shah to the Sultan; a bottle of attar of roses, two carpets, and two felts, being the only presents entrusted to him by the Indian Wazir, to be presented, on his own part, to the Sultan: and the mention of this offensive present, to be offered, not from the shah, nor even from his Grand Wazir, but from Arslan Aga himself to his lord the Sultan, was confined to a postscript.\u2020 The Grand Wazir Mustafa's answer to this insulting letter is very remarkable, not only for the apology it contains, and for the pride evinced, which disdains presents, and prefers to loads of them friendly expressions, but also for the philosophical sentiment expressed therein, that God keeps no account of the extent of empires, but of the justice with which they are governed by the kings their rulers. This letter, not less interesting than that of the Indian Grand Wazir, to which it is the answer, was penned by the Reis Effendi Isari Abdullah, the author of the valuable collection of Turkish state papers, which bears the title Dastur ul insha (the Formula of Epistolary Composition); and a translation of it is given in the Appendix (No. 4).\n\nThere seems to have been no farther diplomatic intercourse between the courts of Dehli and Constantinople during the reign of Sultan Ibrahim. His successor, Muhammed IV., notified his having ascended the throne of his ancestors by the Mutafarika Saiyad Mohi-ud-din, who received the imperial letters on the fourth of Jemad ul awel 1059 (16th of May 1649), as is recorded in the history of Abdipasha, the Nishanji. The same history thus records, four years after, the arrival of the Indian envoy Saiyad Ahmed, in company with Mohi-ud-din.\n\n\"Arrival of an Indian Envoy 1063 (A.D. 1652).\"\n\n\"It has been related amongst the events of the year 1059 (A.D. 1649), that the Mutafarika Saiyad Mohi-ud-din, had been sent from the Sublime Porte to the Padshah of Hindustan with imperial letters, for the purpose of supporting Nasir Muhammed, the khan of the Uzbegs, and reconciling him with his son Abdulaziz, through the interference of the Indian\n\n* Dow, vol. iii., p. 180. \u2020 Vide Appendix, No. 3.\n\"monarch. The P\u00e1dshah of India having now on his side sent one of the\nUlemas of his court, Saiyad Ahmed, they were both ushered into the\nimperial Divan on Tuesday the 21st of Rejeb;* when the Indian Envoy\ndelivered his letters and presents, amongst which were a girdle and dagger\nset with the purest diamonds. The purport of the letters was, that the\nbusiness of Nasir Muhammed, the Khan of the Uzbegs, had been taken\ncare of even before the arrival of the Sultan's letters; and that he had\nbeen restored to the possession of his country: but that he did not enjoy\nit longer than three years and eight months; when some rebels raised\ntheir hands against him, and he died soon afterwards.\"\n\nThe account of the return of Muhi-ud-d\u00edn along with the learned Saiyad\nAhmed, and the nomination of the stupid Zulfikar as ambassador to India,\nforms a very interesting article of Naima's history: but before it is narrated,\nI must notice another extraordinary Indian mission, not from Shah Jehan,\nbut from the learned and unfortunate prince, his son, Dara Shekoh; who\nsent, on his own part, a Mola named Shaki, with a letter to the Grand Waz\u00edr\nMustafa, and offerings to the holy shrines of the Imam Abu Hanifa, and\nthe celebrated saint, Saiyad Abdulkadir Zilani. It is very probable that this\nmission had, besides the ostensible object of offering the presents at the\nholy places, the political one of securing for Dara Shekoh the Sultan's\nfriendship, and perhaps assistance in his schemes to ascend the throne of his\nfather. The prudence which guides the pens of Persian and Indian secre-\ntaries of state, keeps within general phrases; so that the true object of a\nmission or embassy can scarcely ever be guessed at by the mere credentials.\nDara Shekoh's letter and the Grand Waz\u00edr's answer are both given in Isari\nAbdullah's collection; and are translated in the Appendix.\u2020 Dara Shekoh's\nletter does not mention even the presents sent, and refers entirely to Shaki's\noral commission. The Grand Waz\u00edr's answer, full of Turkish bombast, ac-\nknowledges the arrival of the presents destined for the holy shrines; and\nthe wish with which it closes, though it may be taken for nothing else than\nan ordinary compliment, may be also construed to bear a more important\nmeaning, if the Grand Waz\u00edr's verbal reply to Shaki were such as to encou-\nrage Dara Shekoh's rising hopes. This mission of Shaki must have taken\n\n---\n\n* This is a blunder of the copyist; the 21st Rejeb of the year A.H. 1059, which began on\nthe 15th January A.D. 1649, answers to the 21st July, which was on a Saturday.\n\n\u2020 Nos.

It is ten years later that the return of Muhi-ud-d\u012bn, the Turkish ambassador, with the learned Saiyad Ahmed, took place; of whose arrival at, stay, and departure from, Constantinople, Naima gives the following curious account.\n\n\"Arrival of an Indian Ambassador.\n\n\"Muhi-ud-d\u012bn had been formally sent with imperial letters to India; and returned to Constantinople from Shah Jehan, the Padshah of Hindustan, in company with the accomplished ambassador, Saiyad Haj\u012b Ahmed, towards the end of the month Rejeb.\n\n\"On the 23d,* on which day the quarter's rejeh was paid to the troops, he delivered his letters and packets; these contained three most precious presents, the value of which amounted to 300,000 piastres; the first, a brilliant sirguja, or ornament for the turban, the principal diamond of which was greater than that worn by his majesty: the second, a sword; and the third, a dagger. This ambassador, being a learned man, the Waz\u012br, the Mufti, the Kadiaskers, and other dignitaries of the Sublime Porte, gave him splendid entertainments, at which many learned men gifted with the powers of speech, and able to carry on literary disputes and scientific discussions, assisted.\n\n\"These entertainments were given in the palaces on the shores of the Bosphorus, that he might be shewn all the beauties of Constantinople. Indeed, there never were heard of distinctions and attentions more honourable, than those paid to this learned ambassador. After he had been treated in this manner, his credentials of return were written; and, as presents to the Shah of Hindustan, he received an emerald-hilted dagger, twenty-five maidens,\u2020 and a horse, the trappings of which were estimated\n\n* This date shews also the blunder before adverted to; the 23d of Rejeb was not a Tuesday; it was a Monday.\n\n\u2020 Abdipasha, the Nishanji, denies the twenty-five maidens; in opposition to Haji Khalfa, who relates the same fact in his \"Fislika; or, Historical Synopsis.\"\nat ninety purses. The ambassador himself was presented with six thousand ducats, a pelisse, and a richly caparisoned horse; and deliberations were held on the choice of an Envoy who should accompany him back to India. According to established rule and wise custom, one of the Ulemas, or secretaries, a man of business, eloquent, and of refined manners, ought to have been sent: but no regard was paid to these qualifications.\n\nZulfikar Aga, the brother of Selih Pasha, asked for this embassy, offering to defray the expenses of it out of his own pocket. This was reckoned decent, because cheap; and thus this Bosnian ass, who understood nothing at all, was named ambassador, and the companion of the journey of the Indian.\n\nThe Sultan, to whom the Indian ambassador's fine replies and learned discussions were reported, was highly pleased with them; and particularly with his quotation on the beauties of the Bosphorus, at the repast given to him by Behaya Effendi (the mufti), when he repeated the celebrated Persian verses of the Turkish poet Melhemi:\n\n\"As Sh\u0101b-bewam (in Fars), Guta (near Damascus),\nAbola (near Basra), and Soghd (in Transoxania),\nAre celebrated as the four paradises on earth,\nSo the two shores of the Bosphorus are renowned\nIn heaven as celestial abodes!*\n\nThis quotation having been related to the Sultan, he ordered that a learned and accomplished man might be named ambassador to India: 'because,' said he, 'ambassadors are the honour of the monarchs.' The deliberations on this subject having been held between the Waz\u012br and the Mufti, and several learned persons proposed, some men of business observed, 'if you decide on a learned man, he will annoy you with his pretensions and his merit, and you will be obliged to allow him, besides the expenses of his journey, a tawan (a certain sum for his daily living),\n\n* \u0634\u0639\u0628 \u0648 \u063a\u0648\u0637\u0647 \u0648 \u0627\u0628\u0644\u0647 \u0648 \u0633\u063a\u062f\n\u062f\u0631 \u062c\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u0634\u0647\u0631\u062a\u06cc \u062c\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u062f\n\u0647\u0631 \u062f\u0648 \u0628\u063a\u0627\u0632 \u0634\u0647\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u0628\u0648\u0644\n\u062f\u0631 \u062c\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u0634\u0647\u0631\u062a\u06cc \u062c\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u062f\n\n3 P 2\n\"which will fall heavy on our heads.\" So they chose the rich, but stupid,\nZulfikar; whom they instructed to pay a visit to the ambassador, and\ninvite him to a splendid entertainment; but cautioned him to keep his\ntongue within his teeth, lest he might fall into some ridiculous blunders.\nThis ass set out with unusual pomp to visit the ambassador, in order to\nmake him acquainted with his nomination, and invite him to a repast.\nManzada (the son of Fak\u012br-ud-din,* prince of the Druses), relates that\nZulfikar invited to the feast not one eloquent or learned man, except the\npoet Jaori, and the son of Abu Ahmed, one of the sectarians of\nKadizada, the chief of those who affected rigid orthodoxy. These two,\nbeing Zulfikar's intimate friends, were invited that they might entertain\nthe ambassador, and correct their friend's blunders. Jaori is well known\nas a humorous poet; and the son of Abu Ahmed was a man who, pre-\ntending to much zeal for serious study, used to frequent the houses of\nmen of letters in order to get a good place under government; but who\nsecretly mixed in the parties of the gay and the dissipated, with whom he\nwas wont to lay aside all decency and restraint, occasionally siding with\nboth parties, the free as well as the orthodox.\n\nZulfikar gave a splendid repast; at which, amongst other dishes, two\nor three of boiled cabbages were served, which Zulfikar esteemed a great\ndainty. The ambassador having arrived, and many blunders having\nalready been uttered by the master of the house, the table was at length\nspread, and Zulfikar drew the conversation to his favourite dish, asking\nwhether there were any cabbages in India. The ambassador replied that\nthere were many very fine vegetables, but none of so cold a nature and\nso indifferent a taste. Zulfikar, not thoroughly understanding what the\nambassador said, observed, 'Sir, this is a most useful plant, and serves to\nstrengthen the spirits (\u0631\u0648\u062d, rooh): to which the ambassador replied, smiling,\n'that no doubt, cabbages were a cause of wind (\u0631\u064a\u0647, reeh); but that he\nwas not before aware of their relation to wit and spirit, unless it was by\nthe literal affinity of the two words.' Zulfikar, not comprehending a word\nof this jest, but laughing heartily, because he saw the ambassador smiled,\ncontinued: 'Sir, this is a most capital joke indeed: but there is no doubt\nthat the Albanians are a witty set of men from eating much liver, and the\nBosnians a stout race, from eating a deal of cabbage.'\u2014'I should rather\n\n* Commonly called by European writers Facardin.\n\"have supposed,\" said the ambassador, much out of humour, \"that the Albanians would be stout and hardy fellows, and the Bosnians a dull quiet people.\" Jaori and Abu Ahmed checked their inclination to laugh, being ashamed to do so before the face of the master of the house; but they were almost choked by their endeavours to refrain, and could scarcely eat a bit. The dinner being at an end, Zulfikar said, \"Please God, we shall be companions on the road. 'Please God,' replied the ambassador, 'we shall see many curious things, and rejoice in them, if God grants us but health!' He got up and took leave, and pondering on his fine travelling companion, he said to himself: 'Praised be God, who has created an ox in the shape of a man!' The ambassador being gone, Zulfikar asked his friends, Jaori and Abu Ahmed, whether he had not spoken well with this Indian cat? 'These Indians,' said he, 'pride themselves on their spices; but if we did not buy their cloves and cinnamon, to whom could they sell them? Let us shew, therefore, our pride in our own national products. The ambassador spoke no doubt in very refined and set terms, but I answered him in plain Turkish.' Zulfikar being a wealthy man, and chosen for an ambassador, whom it would not be decent to contradict, and impossible to teach better, his two friends thought it wisest to be silent. Jaori, however, could not readily brook this stupidity, and said at last, 'My lord, on such occasions you would do much better to wait for the opening of the conversation, and to answer accordingly; or rather to be silent and listen, than to speak so rashly.' Zulfikar, getting angry, asked whether he had committed any blunder? They told him, he had committed no blunder; but it would have been more convenient to follow that advice. Abu Ahmed, who was on good terms with Manzada (the son of Fakir-ud-din), went to give him an account of this business. 'In truth,' said he, 'viewing the subject with an impartial eye, is it decent to send such vulgar fellows, only on account of their wealth, on embassies, when there is such an abundance of learned and polished men to be found? Is it decent, to commit in such a way the honour of the empire?' All men of sense disapproved of this affair highly, and wondered how Behaya, the Mufti, could give his assent to it. The ambas-\n\n* There is a pun, which will not bear translating, between jigard\u016br courageous, (from j\u012bger, which signifies both liver and courage), and mustereeh, which signifies quiet and inflated.\nsador, having soon afterwards an audience of the Grand Waz\u012br, observed\nthat it would be difficult to arrive in the same time with Zulfikar in India,\nbecause he himself (the Indian envoy) was proceeding by the way of\nYemen, whose Imam was on friendly terms with the Persians, but not\nwith the Turks; and in this manner he contrived to decline Zulfikar's\ncompany. The answer given was, that he might go along with him as\nfar as Hejaz. The ambassador was obliged to assent, and they proceeded\ntogether on their way to that city. Some years after, the son of Fakir-\nud-d\u012bn was sent out ambassador to India. He was a man quite fit for this\ncharge, capable of relating the events of his journey, and the conversa-\ntions which he might hold with the Indian monarchs: all this shall be\nrelated, if it please God, in its proper place, provided God grants me\nthe grace to finish this history.\"\n\nSuch are the words of the Turkish historian: and it is much to be re-\ngretted that he was prevented from continuing his history to the time when\nhe might have inserted a relation of Manzada's Indian journey.\n\nThe answers to the letters sent by Zulfikar, came three years afterwards\nby the Indian ambassador Kaim Beg: of the arrival and departure of whom\nthe printed history of Naima contains the following account:\n\n\"Kaim Beg, the Indian ambassador, and bearer of the answer to the\nletters sent by the Mutafarrika Zulfikar Beg, arrived, on the 17th Rejeb,\n1066 (Friday 11th May, A.D. 1656), at Scutari, where he was lodged\nin the house of a wealthy merchant in the place of Falconers, and sup-\nplied from the imperial kitchen by the inspector and the head cook, sent\nexpressly for this purpose. The next day he passed over in a galley to\nConstantinople, and was met by the Chaushb\u0101shi and some Chaushes, who\nconducted him to the palace of the late Siawush Pasha, which had been\nassigned to him for a residence. On the 21st (15th of May) he was in-\nvited to attend the imperial divan, and treated according to established\ncustom. After the Waz\u012brs had attended at the Sultan's audience, the\nambassador was introduced to deliver his letters at the footstool of the\nimperial throne, and his presents* were carried by two hundred and fifty\nporters.\"*\n\n* Besides many others, he presented a jewelled sword and a jewel-studded dagger, the\ndiamonds of both of which shone in a great blaze. The mistakes which had happened at the\nnomination of Zulfikar, have been related above, among the events of the year 1063.\n\"Departure of Manzada Hussein Beg (the son of Fakir-ud-din) as Ambassador to India, in the year 1067 (A.D. 1656), Naima, ii, 585.\n\n\"In the first days of Zulhaj, Kaim Beg, the Indian ambassador, rubbed his forehead on the footstool of the imperial throne, the audience of leave being granted to him in the kiosk of Muhammed Pasha, in the imperial gardens of Scutari. The imperial presents were delivered into the hands of Manzada Hussein Aga, one of the chamberlains of the Sublime Porte, named ambassador to India, and he was invested in the same garden with the robe of honour. These presents consisted in a sirguja, an ornament for the turban, set with emeralds; four horses of the purest race, three of which were covered with saddle-cloths of gold, and one with jewelled reins, saddle, and stirrups, a golden chain, and the covering embroidered with pearls. The Indian ambassador went first on the road to Haleb, and Hussein was to join him at Bussora, and proceed from thence with him to India.\"\n\nIt is unfortunate that Naima was prevented from inserting in his history Manzada's narrative of his journey, and of the events which took place in India after Khurrum Shah's death. Naima himself had affixed a note, which by his editor's neglect has been printed in the middle of the text, to the following purport: \"Khurrum Shah died, and his younger son Arungzeb mounted the throne; the events which passed between him and his brother, are most circumstantial: it is of the utmost importance to arrange them, and to insert the account in this work, which by no means is to be neglected.\"\n\nThis note has been, as above stated, printed in the text; but the account itself is nowhere inserted.\n\nThe only two Turkish works which, besides the well-known journey overland of Katibi, promise to be of some interest on Indian history and geography, are the above-mentioned description of the embassy of Manzada, the son of Fakir-ud-din, and Katibi's work on the Indian seas, entitled Muhit, that is to say, \"the Ocean.\" The first has not been yet discovered by any European; and the only copy of the second existing in the libraries of Europe is that in the royal library of the Museo Borbonico at Naples.\nAPPENDIX.\n\nNo. I.\n\nLetter written in the year 964 (A.D. 1556), from Shah Akbar to Sultan Suliman, and sent by the Turkish Captain Saiyad Ali.\n\nWishes, breathing every morning from the point, \"the victory cometh from God, and the conquest is near,\" and shining forth from the bridal bed of the text, \"Victory dwelleth but in God the most honoured and the most wise,\"\u2014are presented to those who are attached to the Sublime Porte of his Majesty, elevated as monarch, invested with the dignity of king, possessed of the magnificence of Solomon, the pole of the sky of greatness and fortune, the centre of the circle of majesty and empire; who consolidates the foundations of Islam by his victorious standards; the most sincere of all Sultans in word and in deed; the most true of all Khakhans in truth and evidence; who strengthens the bonds of justice and equity, and destroys the rule of injustice and tyranny; who commands his subjects to keep the statutes of the law, and is ennobled by the text of the Koran:\n\n\"He (God) has sent you as Khalif on earth, a refuge of the princes of the time, an adjuster of the lords of the age.\"\n\nVerse:\n\n\"O Shah! whose name is engraven on the seal of greatness, and in whose time the Khalifat has been carried to perfection; who opens the gates of magnificence and government with the keys of true direction; who grasps the necks of enemies by the auspicious aid of God's assistance; who is the orient of divine light; who adorns the throne of the Khalifat and the title of King of Kings; the adjuster of true faith; the keeper of the evident law; may his victorious standards be elevated to the height of Arcturus, and the recording verses of his victories be inscribed on the leaves of the skies; may the degrees of the columns of revenging power be increased, and the steps of overpowering majesty be augmented!\"\n\nOf God the dispenser of grace,\u2014may his essence be sanctified, and his attributes shine forth!\u2014is asked the duration of the days of empire, and the perpetuation of the Khalifat which ensures the welfare of God's servants: and these wishes are inscribed on the tablets of the Divan which concedes every thing, and whose grants are adorned with the royal cypher (toghra) of accomplishment.\n\nGod be praised that the gates of mystic inspiration are opened by the keys of evidence; and that by his direction, the throne of Sind and of Hind is once more graced as the seat of magnificence and majesty, like that of Solomon.\n\nAlthough, hitherto, correspondence and mutual communications with you, the Khalif of high qualities, have not existed, yet the most excellent qualities and exalted virtues\nof you, the model of Sultans, have always excited the wish of mutual correspondence; as the verse says:\n\n\"Although an hundred deserts separate the heart from the Ka'ba, yet there opens a window from the sanctuary into the soul.\"\n\nand there was always a secret wish and desire that the gates of correspondence should be thrown open. This secret wish not having been hitherto realized, and the accomplishment of this fair desire not having taken place, as was hoped for, the Captain Saiyad Ali, who is ennobled by your high service, came with some Egyptian troops to the shores of Guzerat, and arrived at Dehli, where he delivered the good news of prosperous success and righteous standing.\n\nIt was intimated that he had no commission from you, the cream of kings; and he was not prevented from continuing his journey towards your presence. It occurred to me on this occasion, that by this opportunity the chains of friendship and union might be linked, and the ties of attachment drawn closer. Therefore the pearls of good faith have been arranged on the string of friendship, and the rubies of attachment set in the line of true harmony, to be presented in this letter by these servants belonging to the spheres of your majesty. It is hoped and expected, that also on your part the gates of mutual communication will be opened by the keys of attachment, and the channels of correspondence will not be closed; and that in this manner the foundation of the towering fabric of union will be strengthened and kept free from decay. To say more would only make our heads ache: may the standards of the Khalifat be always spread with glory in the East and in the West; and may the sun of greatness never lower its crest. By Muhammed the Prophet, and his family, the best of servants! By the Lord of the N\u016bn and S\u012brad! (the 68th and 38th chapters of the Koran).\n\n---\n\nNo. II.\n\nLetter from Shah Khurrum to Sultan Murad IV.; delivered by the Ambassador Zar\u012bf.\n\nInfinite praise and heavenly eulogy be offered to the Creator, who has distinguished, amidst his creatures, Sultans by power, force, greatness, and glory; who has constituted monarchs, obeyed by the world, in order to watch over laws divine, and over the execution of heavenly laws and prohibitions; to protect countries and subjects from the mischief of the profligate and obstinate; who has chosen, among this sublime number the Lord of the empire, whose aim is the observance of justice and equity; who is gifted with qualities divine; who follows the sublime example of the Prophet; and for whom and for whose family and friends be the purest of prayers and the most comprehensive of wishes!\n\nHe (the Creator) has chosen him (the Sultan) for the elevated charge of the Khalifat, distinguishing him by the illustrious designation of 'God's shadow on earth.' He has\nimposed on all men, noble and simple, the duty of obeying him, and has subjected them to the statutes of the prophet. He has devised the union of the monarchs of Islam, and the agreement of these foster-fathers of the human kind, as the means of destroying the enemies of the faith, and as a cause of cutting the veins of innovators; he has promised to the concord and alliance of these heavenly bodies (the Kings), the purification of the earth from the weeds and useless herbs of this imprudent race of men (the disbelieving and innovators). Then be infinite praises and benedictions offered to the Lord of exalted station, the leader of the prophets, and commander of the believers; to the best of men, the Lord of the fountains of paradise, and Judge of the day of judgment; who has proclaimed to the world the commands and prohibitions of the Koran, and has particularly enjoined Kings and Princes to exercise justice and equity; who has committed to Moslem Princes the especial duty and obligation of fighting against the opponents of truth and erring innovators, and has decreed to the success of their endeavours the happiness of both worlds. Praises be also offered to the pure and selected, the family of the Prophet; of whom it has been said, \"He has purified you by purification;\"\u2014to this highly connected family, of whom the Prophet said, \"I will ask for you no other reward than the love of my kindred;\"\u2014these sayings are evident proofs of the necessity of loving this high-minded and noble race of instructors; this incomparable mixture of water and clay, who announced the mission of the Prophet, and spread abroad his commands. The scriptural text, \"God be propitious to them,\" is a convincing argument that the creator of heaven and earth is pleased and satisfied with those who accompanied the Prophet in his flight, and afterwards assisted him; and that the repose of these faithful friends is insured in the inmost paradise, and that they are entitled to the highest degree of beatitude.\n\nConsidering that the tie of religion is the strongest of ties, and the concord of sects the most perfect warrant of union; although, for a long time, the gates of correspondence have not been thrown open between this illustrious family of Khalifs and your high-linked lineage; and although the curtain impeding nearer acquaintance has not been lifted up; yet in these happy days, prayers, on which the inhabitants of the highest heaven might glorify themselves, are put forth in the most constant way; and exquisite wishes, with the repetition of which the cherubs would be gratified, are offered for his most high Majesty, who is sublime like the spheres and expansive like the skies, who occupies the station of Alexander and the throne of Solomon; glorious like the sun, powerful like heaven, guarding the precincts of Islam, and guiding the sphere of magnificence; the possessor of the empire of Alexander, and keeper of the two sanctuaries (Mecca and Medina); the glory of the Caesars, the pillar of the Khosro\u00ebs, who adorns the throne of empire, and graces the seat of the conqueror of the world; who disseminates memorials of equity and justice; who avenges the deeds of wickedness and oppression; the Sultan of the champions of the holy war; the Khakhan of the Moslem kings; who enhances the splendour of the Ottoman dynasty, and exalts the standard of that powerful family:\u2014may God extend the days of his reign so long as time shall last!\n\nThe cause of opening this gate of correspondence, and lifting up this veil, is to notify\nthe fresh victories gained in this happy year, and to communicate intelligence of the immense booty which has come in so short a time into the hands of this foster-child of heaven (the Shah of India). As it is most certain that the intelligence of joyful events which happen to friends delights sincere well-wishers, all brethren of the Hanifat (orthodox) sect, must rejoice to hear these splendid achievements, and all Sunnis must be comforted by this glad intelligence. The summary of these brilliant successes is as follows: In a march undertaken from Akberabad, which is the residence and seat of the Khalifat, towards the Deccan, within less than the space of a year, thirty-six strong places have been conquered, each of which is among the most renowned fortresses of the world, and which it would have been impossible to conquer without the special favour of God; because most of them are situated on steep mountains, to the height of which the loftiest soaring birds or most high-flying fancy cannot attain. Two crores of rupees, and a province, the income of which amounts to a crore and a half, have come into the possession of this predominant empire. By God's special grace and favour, the return from this victorious campaign took place in the year 1046. Peace and quiet now being established in the Deccan, and nothing remaining to be achieved in the other Indian provinces, the intention exists of driving back the redheads, those base sectarians.* The first object is the conquest of Candahar, which is on the frontiers of this empire; after which that of Khorassan will follow, if God pleases! The repulse of these innovators and heretics being incumbent on all Moslem monarchs, who are graced with the execution of divine laws, and benefited with the direction of the faithful, it is a most important point to deliver out of their hands Arabian Irak, and particularly Bagdad, where are interred his holiness the great Imam and the Saiyad Abdulkadir Jilani; besides a number of other great men,\u2014to whom may God be merciful!\u2014saints, to whom these heretics bear eternal hatred and enmity. Although you, great monarch,\u2020 undertook last year this most important enterprize, though you conquered Erivan, and carried your victorious arms to Tabriz, you did not remain on the frontiers; but owing to some accidents which happened at Constantinople, returned quickly to your residence, and this affair was not completed. The greatness and glory of this pillar of Sultans, and the wishes of the friends of this powerful dynasty (the Ottoman), has thus not been accomplished, Erivan not having been placed in its possession. They (the Sultan), by rousing their mind and assembling their forces, may advance once more with speed; and, by proper means, remain on the frontiers of Haleb and Adina for two or three years; and despatch thence every year powerful armies against the redheads; one towards Irak and Bagdad, and the other to Erivan and Aderbijan. It is to be hoped that, by the will of God, and with the assistance of these great saints\u2014may God sanctify their tombs!\u2014they shall vanquish these wayward people, conquer their provinces, and purifying the blessed and holy tombs of the dirt of the presence of these cursed, impudent, and disbelieving innovators, acquire a glorious name and great reward in both worlds. If God please, the revenging armies of this petitioner at the throne of eternity, shall\n\n* Kuzzubashes, the Persians, who are generally Shi'as. \u2020 Murad IV.\narrive ere then on the frontiers of Candahar and Khorassan; and a hint having been given also to the rulers of Transoxiana and Balkh, they will move at the same time, and make on their side all possible exertions. In this manner, this erring and wayward people cannot but be exterminated. As this letter must be carried by one of the trusty servants of this court, Mir Zarif, who is ennobled as a Saiyad by ancient descent from the Prophet, has been entrusted with it, and is destined to perform this service. As the object of his mission is but the delivery of this letter, they will be pleased to dismiss him speedily, and to open again the gates of correspondence, formerly shut.\n\nMay the days of empire and perpetual happiness, and the blessings of God, be showered down without end!\n\nNo. III.\n\nLetter from the Wazir of the Shah of Hindustan to the Grand Wazir Mustafa Pasha.\n\nYou, who are elevated on the high cushion of Wazirship, and who grace the sublime carpet of absolute empire, who digest the most important affairs of the Sultans of R\u00fbm\u2014Mustafa Pasha,\u2014may your honour and fortune be continually augmented!\u2014after having invoked for you numerous blessings, the notification of a sound sense and a lucid mind opens in the following way: The office of ambassador having been conferred on the honourable Arslan Aga, Mir Zarif (having been dismissed from the glory of the C\u00e6sars of R\u00fbm) has conducted him in the most distinguished manner; and in all subahs and districts the governors have met him with all possible distinctions and honours. After their arrival at Mult\u00e2n, Mir Zarif, making all possible haste, kissed the ground before the throne on the 29th Zilhij 1049, and was distinguished by the imperial grace and favor. Soon afterwards, when the servants of his Majesty the Khalif, the Khan of the times, the Shetims\u00e9r of the world, the shadow of God, were occupied in Kashmir, which has no equal in the world, and which is the most sweet and pleasant spot on earth, from the sweetness and plenty of its roses and the fragrance of its herbs, Arslan Aga was further graced with the happiness of kissing the threshold, which vies with the skies, and delivered the imperial letter intended for the welfare of the world. When this letter was submitted for the inspection of the secretaries of state, it appeared that amongst the servants of your glorious court, and amongst its secretaries, there was nobody acquainted with the ceremonials of ancient Sultans, and the modes of cultivating the friendship of great monarchs, particularly of this imperial family, the ancestors of which have made the surface of the earth their tennis court, and held it their glory to bring to obedience all the kings of the universe.\n\nBy the infinite grace of God the almighty, their sway extends over the wide range of Hind\u00fbstan, which being the fourth part of the world, is girded on three sides by the sea. To it belongs all Cabulist\u00e2n, Ghizni, Candahar, Duder, and Bast, which is one of the\nappurtenances of Khorassan; Sind, commonly called Tatta, Bikkar, Sigist\u0101n as far as Kaiji; Mekr\u0101n, and that part of Lahore belonging to Tatta, where Arslan Aga landed. From thence begins the length of Hindustan, which extends to the salt sea, where the boundary is formed by the vast province of Bengal bordering on the sea. This extent is so vast, that the merchants who travel each day, can encompass it but in the space of a year or more. The same is its immense breadth, which begins at Cabul and the Indian passes (kutal) of Hindukash; Candahar and Bast Harr\u0101n are also subjected to this victorious empire. It terminates at the Deccan, bordering also on the sea, and its breadth is, like its length, of a year's journey. There are innumerable sipahis and troops, which no other monarch of the world could collect; huge elephants, and other requisites for the conquest of the world, all subject to the power of the servants of this celestial threshold. The (Ottoman) secretaries were ignorant in what manner such a power should be addressed, and what regard should be paid to such a state.\n\nThe principal object of Mir Zar\u012bf's mission was the purchase of Persian horses; but the governor of Ir\u0101k having insisted that such horses were not to be found there, but should be sought for in Arabia, we shall not henceforth send to Ir\u0101k for them, but to Arabia, because the Arabian horses are finer than those of Ir\u0101k. What his Majesty, the successor of the four Khal\u012bfs, (the Sultan) has done for the exaltation of the standard of Islam deserves the blessings of God and the Prophet, and of his sainted followers; because the imperial (Ottoman) family has engaged in war with the infidel Franks, and with the innovating redheads. The letters notifying these victories, and written in the style which great men use to write to ministers, which arrived by the above ambassador, opened the gates of amity, and intimated that he should be recognized as the envoy of the Sublime Porte. He notified to the sainted mind of his Majesty, what should be done against these vile redheads: namely, that his Majesty the Shah, on one side, and one of his glorious princes\u2014a pearl of the jewelled shrine of fortune, a jewel of the crown of stateliness,\u2014should endeavour to conquer Candahar as well as Khorassan, and drive away these misbelievers, and to clear the rosebed of the orthodox Sunnis from the weeds of this idle heresy; in the same way as had been cleared by religious zeal Bagdad, the burying-place of the guide of all evidence, the reviewer of religious duties, the most glorious chief and leader to truth, the great Im\u0101m; Bagdad, the monumental spot of the president of saints, the traveller in the paths of sanctity, his Holiness Saiyad Abdul Kad\u0101r Jilani. All this has been related as it happened, and it has been intimated that, with respect to the great distance, another envoy should be sent to transact business. Meanwhile, on the return of the victorious standards from this incomparable country, Kashmir,\u2014to which may be applied the verse of the Koran, \"A paradise through which rivers run,\"\u2014news arrived at the city of Lahore from Candahar, Sind, Guzerat, Surat, and Canauj, all intimating that, in obedience to the divine decree which prescribes the bounds of existence to every being, and according to the text, \"Every soul must taste of death,\" the glory of Caesars, the chief of Sultans, had left this inconstant world, obeying the call, \"O tranquil soul, return to thy lord; return well pleased and grateful,\"\u2014and had wandered into paradise; and\nthat, according to his last will, the empire of R\u00fbm had descended to his brother, elevated amongst the Caesars, assisted by the divine aid, whose name is that of the favourite of God (Ibrahim); on which account Arslan Aga was permitted to return. Various messages implying friendship, amity, and harmony, have been entrusted to his tongue, to be delivered to the royal ear; but as, for the reason above specified, no royal letters have been written, neither was there occasion for presents, nor any one who should accompany them; however proper it may be that ambassadors with suitable presents should pass to and fro, in order to convince the enemies of the faith of the harmony of the Moslem monarchs. Arslan Aga having solicited to be forwarded by the way of Surat, orders have been issued to the magistrates of that place to convey him in one of the royal ships in the most honourable manner. By the opportunity afforded by his departure, these two words have been written by the express command of his Majesty, to whom the world is obedient, that it may be known that he was honoured with a royal audience, and was presented with a bottle of the royal atar of roses, which exhales the sweetest perfume in the world; and that two carpets and two felts, esteemed among the greatest rarities of the world, and which can nowhere be found but in the imperial palace, have been bestowed on the said ambassador, that he may present them on his own behalf to his Majesty the glory of Caesars.\n\nMay the gates of happiness be thrown open to the world by the lord of servants!\n\nNo. IV.\n\nLetter from the Grand Wazir Mustafa Pasha, to the Wazir of the Padshah of Hindustan; written by the Reis Effendi Isari Abdullah, the author of the collection of State Papers, entitled \"Dustur ul insha,\" i.e. the formula of Epistolary Composition.\n\nAfter wishes that\u2014so long as the azure vault of heaven may be adorned with the pearls of the planets and gems of the fixed stars, and so long as the chain of the elements is holden together by the celestial motions and sidereal conjunctions,\u2014the propitious image of just Sultans, who are the delight of Sunis and the orthodox, may ensure the repose and safety of the world; and after having offered the drops of purest prayers and the emanations of amber-scented blessings, distilling from the fountain of love, to the enlightened rosebed and illuminated garden of him who is placed in the seat of Wazirship to the greatest Sultan of Hind, and enthroned on the cushions of the greatest Khakan of Sind, the Nawab enjoying the highest titles, Abdulilam Islam Khan\u2014may his honours last for ever!\u2014let the following be notified to his mind reflecting like a mirror.\n\nEvery one of the Sultans and Khakans of the Ottoman family, who, by the infinite grace of God, is seated on the throne of Solomon, is the lord of the times and of the world. Exalting the victorious standards of holy war, they have foiled the enemies of\nthe faith by the conquest of towns and castles, and by the flashing of their scimetars, To uphold the divine commands, to observe the statutes of the prince of Prophets and guardian of the two sanctuaries, to advance all affairs belonging to the garden of the illumined tomb of the Prophet, all these services form the diadem of the glorious head of the Ottoman monarchs, and the desire of righteous Khalifs; and constitute the band wherewith they adorn their turbans. Their deeds are praised by tongues and pens, and traced on the leaves of day and night.\n\nThe late Sultan Murad IV. of blessed memory, who now slumbers in the cradle of divine mercy, and reposes on the cushions of forgiveness, had begun a holy war, according to the text, \"Combat in the ways of God:\" and the noble purport of the verse, \"We have granted to thee evident conquest,\" was reflected from the polished mirror of his illuminated mind like the descent of heavenly inspirations. Under the auspices of the words \"God has aided thee with a brilliant victory,\" he issued from his imperial residence; and, according to the text, \"and we shall give them troops (so numerous) as never were seen before,\" he marched with armies, rushing on like the waves, arrayed like the Pleiades, and swift and sure like the shafts of fate; and Bagdad, the celestial abode of heavenly influence, after it had been for some time the dwelling-place of base heretics, by God's grace, being, with all its advantages, reconquered and arrayed in the list of Ottoman provinces, his Majesty returned with good fortune and prosperity to his sublime residence and capital: but the messenger of fate having announced the message of predestinated death, by the words, \"Return to thy Lord,\" the falcon of the celestial spirit flew away from the narrow nest of elementary composition into the vast field of divinity, and his gracious body having been entrusted, like a hidden treasure, to the chest of the earth, the throne of the Kalifat and of Suliman was granted\u2014according to the words, \"We have placed thee as our successor on earth,\"\u2014to the eye of the Khalifat, the splendour of the garden of empire, the chief of the Ottoman orchard, the cream of Suliman's progeny, the clasp of the girdle of kingdoms, the place of the collar of dignity, the conquering hero of R\u00fbm, Arabia, and Persia, the ruler of the century, the Shah of the world, the Sultan, God's shadow upon earth, ruler of two parts of the earth, the Khakan of two oceans, the servant of the two sanctuaries (Mecca and Medina), the Sultan son of a Sultan, the Khakan son of a Khakan, called after the name of God's favourite (Abraham),\u2014Sultan Ibrahim Khan, brother of Sultan Murad Khan, and son of Sultan Ahmed Khan. Since the throne has been graced by his excellent person, resplendent as the sun, the gates of welfare and prosperity have been opened on his fortunate forehead, and the pearl of fortune and blessing has been placed in the shell of his Khalifat; the flashing of his royal scimeter is the dawn in the east of good fortune, and the terror of his imperial standards is the sun of the spheres of fate; he is the lord of the world,\u2014the Sulim\u00e2n of the times:\n\n\"Since God has created the world, was never seen such a king and lord.\"\n\nMay the suns of his good fortune always rise on the foreheads of men, and may the lights of his grace never set till the end of time!\n\nThese news, through time and space having reached the noble hearing of his highness,\nthe most celebrated among the rulers of the world, the greatest of Indian monarchs, Arslan Aga, the glorious amongst the renowned and noble\u2014may his credit be perpetuated!\u2014who had been sent with the royal letters of the late Sultan Murad, of celestial abode, to perform the honourable service of ambassador, was allowed to return, and arrived in the high and well-guarded residence of Constantinople the sixth of Jemad ul awel, in the year 1052.\n\nHaving had the good fortune to kiss the ground of the fortunate threshold, he delivered the friendly letter of your high excellency to this unfeigned friend. The inspection of its well-penned contents brought to light the complaint of the secretaries not having adhered to accustomed courtesy in the letters sent from these parts, and the magnificent enumeration of all the provinces of Hind and of Sind. Be it, therefore, imparted to their * luminous minds, that the Ottoman Sultans, seated on the throne of Sulim\u00e1n, never were animated but with friendship towards the Indian monarchs, who adorn the throne of Lahore. By the union of the belief of Sunis, and by their accordance of faith, this friendship and affection is evident; and no reason whatsoever for inimical feeling being in existence, how can it occur to their minds that any slight in the observance of friendly regard was intended; and if some words, subject to many interpretations, have been taken in an unpleasant manner, it is not worth while to speak of such a deviation from right intention, nor was it prudent to search in such words for remote significations. If, in the royal letters sent from hence, the expected degree of honourable expression has not been attained, and such a want was taken amiss, is this a reasonable and just ground for omitting\u2014in your letter the rules of the humble respect due to his Majesty, the glorious Padshah, the King of kings, and refuge of the world? Therefore, it having always been usual that great monarchs participating of the Hanifa truth, and firm in the paths of friendship, should hold open the gates of correspondence and friendly intercourse, and that they should send ambassadors of pleasant language and great knowledge, in order to strengthen the ties of friendship and union, by compliments of condolence and congratulation: this has not only been neglected, but no royal letter having been sent, it must reflect on the mirror of their minds, that this was not accordant with established custom and friendly intercourse between great monarchs. If the numerous provinces of the mighty Ottoman empire were here to be enumerated, their list would not be contained within the boundaries of this letter. But, not to trespass on the command of the Koran, \"Proclaim the graces of thy Lord,\" let it be known to you, that whereas by God's grace, the sanctity of the house of God (Mecca), the garden of the Prophet (Medina), the holy city (Jerusalem), and both the birth and burying-places of the greatest Prophets, are situated within the boundaries of this empire; and whereas the direction of their affairs is entrusted to the hands of the powerful Ottoman Sultans, all the sects of Isl\u00e2m both orthodox and heterodox, and all christian nations seek refuge at the foot of their sublime throne. All the monarchs of the world acknowledge the truth, shining forth like the sun, that the Sultans of the Ottoman family are the greatest monarchs of\n\n* An orientalism, meaning only the luminous mind of the King of Hindustan.\nthe earth. Notwithstanding, God, the Almighty, looks not to the number of provinces, and the extent of the empires of the kings of this world; but he demands from them an account of the justice and mercy shewn to the weak who are subject to their sway. In the postscript, the carpets and felts, entrusted to Arslan Aga, were vaunted with the observation, that they were worthy to be presented to his Majesty the Padshah by Arslan himself\u2014the Ottoman Padshahs are above such trifles, and hold expressions of friendship and sincerity higher than a thousand loads of gifts and presents. Be this impressed on their noble knowledge; and may they not cease to strengthen the chain of love and faith by the progress of embassies. Be the leaves of fortune inscribed with the letters of harmony, and the sheets of good fortune impressed with the characters of friendly intercourse!\n\nBy the Prophet, his pure family, and his glorious companions!\n\n---\n\nNo. V.\n\nLetter from Dara Shekoh, the son of the Padshah of Hindustan, to the Grand Wazir.\n\nYou, who confirm the foundations of empire, who elevate the greatness of dominion, who are the refuge of power, the fabric of magnificence, the station of highness, the landing-place of inspiration, the orient of honour and fortune, the object of the effulgence of power, the alighting-place of the graces of God, the watering-trough of the showers of sublime grace, and the head of Wazirs\u2014after friendly greetings, be it known to you that Mulla Shaki, well worthy of the grace with which he is intrusted, presents himself to your service: be pleased to listen to what he has to say; and may the gates of correspondence be opened by his return! If it please God, our servant shall henceforth always go and come for your sublime service. Health and a good end to you! May he not remain who does not wish your continuance\n\nAnswer to the preceding, from the Grand Wazir Mustafa Pasha to the Indian Prince Dara Shekoh.\n\nSo long as the sun mounts in the skies, and the lord of the spheres passes through the space of heaven, clothed with starry robes and glories in the highest station, so long may the star of him remain in the zenith of greatness and glory, who is the sun of the sphere of dominion, the constellation of power and might, and the highest link in the chain of royal progeny, to whom repair the most honourable Sultans: of him who is the most powerful of the Khakans of Hind, the light of the pupil of empire, the Prince of the orchard of glory, the crop of white hair on the forehead of power, the pearl of dominion; who adorns both the throne and the crown, the Prince of highest renown, of early fortune! After having offered these pure and amber-scented wishes, at the commencement\nof which the accomplishment of them is traced, and at the end of which the fulfilling of them is placed, with the most dutiful demonstrations of honour and respect, as a present to the dawn of the morn of royal fortune, the friendly intimation* to this brilliant and polished genius, is as follows.\n\nIn the noblest and most fortunate of hours, the musk-scented letters issued from their glorious place, and, carried by Mulla Sh\u0101ki\u2014who power may it be augmented!\u2014have arrived. The pearls of eloquent words strung in its contents by the point of the wonderful pen, have shed the lustre of their signification; and the virgin brides of friendly expressions, which were sitting in the closets of perception, have shone forth on the bridal bed of understanding and meaning. The sublime and friendly presents to the enlightened burying-places of the great Imam Abu Hanifa, who is the leader of knowledge and science, the Kibla of modesty and kindness, the director of the law, the master of the greatest Ulemas\u2014God be propitious to him!\u2014and of the Saiyad Abdulkadir Jilani, who is the most wise in the mystic path, the most learned in ascetic truth, brought up at the threshold of subjection, burned in the fire of divine attraction, vested with the robes of inspiration and wonder, magnified by joy and sanctity, the leader of those who tread the path of divine mercy,\u2014may his tomb be sanctified!\u2014these presents have been duly forwarded by the permission of his majesty the Sultan of the Sultans of the world, the Khakan of Khakans of the time, the monarch endowed with the power of Sulim\u0101n, the refuge of the world, the lord of his age, the Alexander of his time, the most fortunate, glorious, just, merciful, and gracious Padshah:\u2014may God exalt his victories, prolong his life, and extend his reign to the end of time!\u2014The aforesaid Mulla Sh\u0101ki\u2014may his power be increased!\u2014has been sent on with some trusty men accompanying him: it has been enjoined by an imperial command, and a strong letter from this sincere-hearted friend, that as soon as he shall have performed his high commission he shall not be delayed a moment. From their royal nature and qualities it is hoped and wished that they may be pleased to strengthen the pillars of friendship and union by repeatedly sending of friendly sheets, which produce the increase of good understanding. May the fragrant tree of their high destinies be planted on the brink of the river of fortune, and may the lofty palm of their elevation be guarded from the misfortune of decay!\n\nBy the Prophet and his glorious family.\n\n* Mukhalassat intima \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0643\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0629\nXXIII. Observations on the Sculptures in the Cave Temples of Ellora.\u2014By Captain Robert Melville Grindlay, M.R.A.S.\n\nRead January 16, 1830.\n\nIn presenting to the Royal Asiatic Society the four accompanying representations of the Ellora Sculptures, in continuation of those which I had the honour of submitting last session, I have to regret that, from the very scanty and imperfect intelligence procurable on the spot, I am unable to attach to some of them any descriptive notice that would be at all satisfactory.\n\nTo those better acquainted with Hindu mythology I leave the task of assigning to each groupe and figure its appropriate legend: my principal object being to draw the attention of the Society to these interesting specimens of an art, which must have attained a much greater degree of perfection than has been generally believed to be the case in any period of the history of India.\n\nWithout presuming to ascribe to Hindu sculpture the classical purity and elegant proportions of the Grecian chisel, it may not be too much to assert that it displays considerable grandeur of design and intenseness of expression. The muscular powers being less developed in an Indian climate, the Hindu sculptor appears to have resorted to exaggeration to give that energy, which his imagination suggested, but of which he saw no living models; hence all the points of beauty in the human form are overcharged, and the limbs are multiplied to express various attributes and supernatural powers.\n\nIn the fine forms of northern and western Hindustan we often see an approximation to the Belvidere Apollo; but the muscular energy of the celebrated Torso, or the Farnesian Hercules, is rarely, if ever, to be met with in any part of India which I have visited.\n\nThe encouragement and protection which sculpture and painting have in all ages and countries received from religion, have also been, in some degree, the sources of many of the absurdities which those arts occasionally display: hence the many-armed and many-headed personages of the Hindu\nOlympus, and the no less incongruous compositions of even the Augustan age of Italian art. Raphael, Michael Angelo, and Guido, did violence to their own taste and judgment, when, in obedience to the commands of their patrons, they represented miracles and legendary tales, which set nature and common sense alike at defiance.\n\nA state of tranquillity and relative liberty appears at all times to have been favourable to the cultivation and perfection of arts and sciences. The acknowledged superiority of the sculpture in the cave temples of Ellora, and the obscurity which has hitherto enveloped the history of those stupendous and magnificent monuments of labour and ingenuity, may therefore equally afford a rational ground for ascribing to them a very remote antiquity; because, from their magnitude and extent, as well as from their elaborate perfection, they are more likely to have been the production of a powerful and refined people in a state of peace and prosperity, than a place of refuge of a proscribed and persecuted sect.\n\nThe architectural character of these excavations affords a powerful corroboration of this hypothesis; for they are evidently not the rude and early effort of a people emerging from a state of barbarism, but imitations of a style of building matured and refined by ages of practice and experience.\n\nThe superior execution observable in the remains of sculpture and architecture throughout India appears to be in proportion to their antiquity: the more rude, though not less stupendous excavations at Karli near Poonah, in the islands of Salsette and Elephanta, and in other parts of the coast, bear a similar relation to their respective distances from the seat of government, and, consequently, from the source of art and refinement which was to be found alone in the interior. In the plate No. 5, now presented to the Society, the upper compartment represents Maha Deva and his consort Parvati playing at shatrinji or chess, surrounded by their attendants; whilst a dyte, or evil spirit (of discord), is sitting by, exciting the divinities to a dispute which terminated in a fatal quarrel and separation. The inhabitants of the Hindu Olympus, alarmed at the terrible consequences of this feud, implored the intercession of Brahma, who called in the aid of Kama Deva the god of love.\n\nThis divinity, who is usually represented as a beautiful youth armed with a bow of sugar-cane, or flowers, with a string of bees, attempts to touch the heart of Maha Deva with one of his arrows tipped with a flower of a stimulant property: the enraged deity reduces the audacious boy to ashes, with a\nglance from his central eye; but the repentant wife having, under the disguise of a wood nymph, won the affections of her lord, is reunited to him: and Kama Deva, according to the fable, is restored, by transmigration, in the form of a son of Krishna.\n\nIn this plate the attitudes of the two deities are remarkable for their ease, correctly representing the Indian mode of sitting in the present day. The dice appear to be just thrown; and the hands of the divinities are held up in the attitude of reproof and expostulation: whilst the demon of discord sits in a common attitude of old men, with an expression evidently exulting in the mischief he has occasioned.\n\nThe three female attendants behind Parvati are occupied in their respective offices of dressing her hair and fanning her, and one has the fragment of a chowrie, or bunch of feathers, to beat off the flies. The sturdy masculine figure of the mace-bearer is finely contrasted with the slender and graceful form of the young female attendant. Corresponding figures stand behind Maha Deva and complete the group, which displays considerable skill and harmony of composition, as well as individual beauty of form and grace of attitude.\n\nThe group below represents the Nunda, or Bull, sacred to Maha Deva, surrounded by a gana, or troop of grotesque characters, which appear to be the gnomes and sprites of Hindu poetical machinery, and are never failing accompaniments in all the ancient cave sculptures.* The variety and sportive character of their attitudes are as remarkable as the truth and spirit displayed in the form and action of the Bull which they surround.\n\nNo. 6 appears to be a marriage procession of the same elf-like beings, bearing some faint resemblance to that of Cupid and Psyche in the ancient Grecian sculptures.\n\nNo. 7 is supposed to represent the goddess Kali under her several attributes of Maha, or the great, Bhadra, or the propitious, and Siv\u0101 as peculiarly the consort of Siva or Maha Deva. They are seated on a kind of throne, on which there are still the remains of something like a damask or flowered drapery; their heads recline easily on cushions; while their attitudes are as graceful as their forms are beautiful, though with the exception\n\n* See Dr. Babington's account of the sculptures at Mahamalaipur, Vol. II, Part I. of the Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society.\nbefore alluded to.* I must here repeat what I have already stated, that all the drawings were made on the spot, and this one in particular, with the most scrupulous attention to accuracy; and that, so far from magnifying, I fear I have not done justice to the singular grace and beauty of this striking group.\n\nOf No. 8 I could procure no explanation whatever on the spot; nor have I succeeded in obtaining any satisfactory conjecture of its meaning.\n\nThe principal figure, which was much mutilated, appears to be drawing an inferior from the jaws of the Makara, a sea monster, surrounded by marine productions: and Makara being the Capricorn of the Hindu Zodiac, the group may possibly have some occult chronological signification, as Colonel Tod has suggested in his remarks upon my former communication on this subject.\u2020\n\nThe architecture and sculptures of India present a wide and interesting field for research; and much valuable information on these subjects may be expected from the translation of the Silpa S\u0101stra, which is said to contain the principles of them, and of other arts and sciences of the Hindus.\n\n* Amongst the sculptures recently presented to the Royal Asiatic Society by Colonel Harriot, there are one or two fragments of very superior beauty, and approaching nearer to these sculptures at Ellora than any I have seen in England.\n\n\u2020 Vol. II.

Remarks on the Religious and Social Institutions of the Bouteas, or Inhabitants of Boutan, from the unpublished Journal of the late Samuel Davis, Esq. F.R.S. &c. Communicated by J.F. Davis, Esq. F.R.S. M.R.A.S.\n\nRead February 20, 1830.\n\nMany principles and forms of the religion of the Lamas are evidently borrowed from that of the Hindoos. They have similar ceremonies performed on the banks of rivers, and the Ganges is held in equal veneration. A little of its water is a most valuable acquisition to one of their faquires or pilgrims, who carries it in a small brass or silver bottle, carefully corked, and tied to his girdle. Their supreme deity, called indiscriminately by the name Sijamony, Mahamony, and Sejatoba, is said to have been brought many ages ago by one of the superior Lamas from Benares, and others of them must have been of foreign extraction; for although plainly drawn and carved as females, the priests will not allow them of that sex; and often, as they think, decide the distinction with a pair of whiskers, when the turn of the features and swell of the bosom shew whiskers to be misapplied.\n\nCertain forms of their devotion and principles of their religion bear almost as much resemblance to particular observances of the Romish church, such as the celibacy of the clergy, and the monastic life of societies of both sexes; to which might be added their strings of beads, their manner of chanting prayers, their incense, and their candles. With regard to the first, it is strange that men should voluntarily impose so severe a duty on themselves as that of celibacy; or, if originally imposed upon them by others, \"when old and past the relish of delight,\" it is equally to be wondered at that so large a proportion of the people as compose the class of Gylongs, have at no time exerted that authority and that superiority of understanding which they certainly possess, in exploding so grievous and unnatural a custom. The inclination which every one of them must secretly feel for such a reform, one would think, might have pointed out the favourable circumstances under which it could be attempted in Boutan, where, from the strength of the country, they are in no danger of feeling the resentment of the church of Thibet, and where their other neighbours\nwould certainly take no concern in the affair. The common people, it is true, would at first be under some astonishment at so great an innovation in the principles of their religion, made by those themselves who are the expounders and guardians of it; but they would soon be pacified when they found it productive of no injurious effects on society, but that, on the contrary, instead of the irregularities and licentiousness which must in the present case be continually practised, they would obtain settlements for their daughters and female relations, and profitable connexions for themselves. They would also be relieved from an unequal share of the concern of prolonging the race, which from time immemorial has been imposed as a drudgery on the lower classes of Zeen Caabs and husbandmen. Or, should they on such an occasion be refractory, the principal stores of arms are in the possession of the gylongs, who, assembled, would compose a numerous body, not less able in their strength, and animated by the peculiar nature of their cause to more arduous exertions. The women would undoubtedly incline to favour that party whose object it was to retrieve them from the degraded condition they now unjustly suffer, and to raise them to a rank in society which they merit, and which in some other countries they possess; and from a state of filth and misery to make them partners in such comfort, conveniences, and happiness as the country affords. The greater part of the Gylongs lodged in the castle of Tacissudon are of an age and constitution which would induce one to think might easily be engaged in such a project, but when asked concerning this unpleasant part of their condition, they reply that it is impossible for any one who wears the red dress (the habit of the order) to find it irksome, or to feel the inconvenience supposed. Their religion in other respects seems less debased by superstitions, and ridiculous rites and ceremonies, and has the excellent quality of being tolerant in its sentiments of other principles and forms of worship. A faquire of any cast or nation who enters the country is treated with respect, and they admit of proselytes, but are not anxious for their conversion, thinking with the Hindoos that the various roads to heaven, pointed out by other modes of faith, are equally practicable with their own; that is, by a due conformity to the manner of exterior worship prescribed, and a strict discharge of the moral duties. The Rajah, pointing to the images and pictures of the deities that adorned his room, asked if we used such things, and being answered in the negative, said it did not signify, since it was the same Being we all adored.\nTheir system of the universe consists of, first, the celestial regions, described as situated on the summit of a square rock of immense magnitude and height, its sides severally composed of crystal, ruby, sapphire, and emerald. Here dwells the Supreme Being, in a habitation to which good men after death have admission, and find clothes, provisions, and everything they want and wish prepared for their reception. About half way down is the region of the sun and moon, placed on opposite sides of the rock, and constantly revolving round it for the purpose of giving day and night to the lower world. The vicissitudes of the seasons are also accounted for by the irregularity of the superior luminary's monthly revolutions. Beneath is the ocean, surrounding the whole, with seven stripes of dry land encompassing the foot of the rock, and some islands, the residence of mankind. The Rajah pointed out that island which comprehends Boutan, Bengal, &c., as situated in the south or sapphire side. The infernal regions are under the earth, where the wicked are to be tormented in everlasting fire; melted brimstone will be poured down their throats, and their cries neither pitied nor regarded.\n\nThe priests have no separate buildings erected purposely for the exercise of religious ceremonies, in the manner of our churches, the pagodas of the Hindoos and Chinese, or the mosques of the Mahometans. Their devotions are always performed before altars erected in large apartments appropriated to this use in the palaces or castles where the Gylongs are lodged\u2014these residences themselves being, in fact, the temples. The supreme deity is here represented by a colossal figure, Syatoba, gilt, and sitting cross-legged. His principal agent (or, as they express it) his vizier, of a much smaller size, is placed before him, and surrounded by images of the former Lamas, in rows one above the other, of a diminutive size. The destroying power appears a little lower in front, his countenance enraged, and his numerous arms uplifted, menacing with a variety of weapons. Before the altar is a bench with a row of small brass cups, filled with water, and some with rice: also a lamp burning, pots with flowers, and many trifling ornaments. Mirrors and glass-ware of any kind are thought a great embellishment. This apartment or chapel, of which there are more than one in every castle, often comprehends two stories of the building, a part of the upper one railed round as a gallery, whence spectators may view the ceremonies below. Here the priests assemble at their meals, receiving their portion of victuals as they sit cross-legged in rows, muttering over an abundance of graces and prayers, with the horns, drums, and bells sounding\nat intervals. Into these places any person may enter; all they require is, that the altar and its furniture be not approached too near, nor touched. Every individual of the priesthood, who has a house of his own in the religious villages, or an apartment to himself in either of the palaces, erects a small altar for his own particular use, decorated in much the same manner, though less splendidly than the others. Their forms of devotion, as far as I have been a witness of them, chiefly consist of repeating long prayers in a sitting posture, occasionally bending before the altar, and touching the floor with the forehead; the horns, bells, and drums being sounded at intervals. The chapel at these times is filled with Gylongs sitting in ranks, one half of the number fronting the other half, and leaving a lane from the altar up the middle of the chapel. The Gylongs alone join in these practical forms of worship, nor are the rest of the people under any obligation to enter the chapels: an opening is however sometimes left, through which they can view the image and prostrate themselves before it. To maintain a proper sense of religion many small temples are built by the road-side; they are generally of a square form, and have either pictures of the deity within-side, to be viewed through gratings, or are of solid masonry, with the same figures cut on slate in relief, and fixed all round in a row near the top. At these places are also erected high poles with a narrow stripe of cloth fastened to each like a flag, on which is written and repeated from top to bottom the word *omanipeemehong*. The same word, cut in relief on stone, is fixed in a row against a sort of wall, frequently found in the neighbourhood of the little temples. These fabrics are white washed, and have a broad stripe of red round the upper part. The buildings with their flags are picturesque, and ornamental to the country. There is, besides, in use at these buildings a religious instrument with which all classes may amuse themselves, a sort of whirligig, or barrel set upright to turn on a spindle. The inside is filled with a roll of paper, printed all over with the above word. It is fixed in a recess against either of the previously mentioned buildings, with a hole to admit the hand, and every devout passenger, as he goes by, may give it a twirl. This might be thought of trivial regard, but with the natives it is held in so much consideration, that at the entrance of some of the castles are such things fixed in frames finely ornamented and gilt. At Wandepore was one with a crank to the spindle, and a man, every morning, sate keeping it constantly turning whilst he repeated the word *omanipeemehong*. Sometimes three of these barrels, of a larger size, are seen inclosed in a little building erected purposely for their reception, and\nkept continually in motion by the spindles passed through the floor and fixed each of them to a water-wheel below. The meaning of the word is said to implore a blessing, and they mutter it over as the Catholics do their 'Ave Marias,' dropping a bead at each repetition! The common people make themselves a little domestic altar near the house, consisting of a pile of stones about three feet high, before which they lay leaves, fruits, or blades of corn, in the manner of the ryots in Bengal.\n\nAs the priests are incapable by their own means of keeping up the number of their establishment, they receive from time to time boys taken from the most respectable families in the country, and from others who have interest to procure their children to be admitted of the order. It seems necessary they should be admitted at such an age, that by early habit they may be taught to endure the dull tasteless life they have to undergo. In the castle of Tacissudon are a number of these people, some of them employed as tailors, embroiderers, and painters, in preparing the sacerdotal habits, and the variety of religious furniture. Some few attend on the person of the Rajah, acting as secretaries, and in such like confidential capacities, but the far greater part of them pass their time with perfect insipidity. Between the intervals of devotion they are generally seen lolling over the balconies of their apartments, not being allowed to stir out of the castle except on every eighth day, when they walk out one by one in a line according to seniority, the youngest bringing up the rear, and proceed in regular order to an island in the river to bathe. Their tedious moments are not much relieved by sleep, if they pass the night fixed in the posture which the Rajah informed us it was necessary for every Gylong to use. It is sitting cross-legged, with the feet brought to rest in the upper part of the opposite thigh. The body is stretched stiffly upwards, that the arms, without being at all bent, may be close to the sides, and the hands with the palms upwards rest also upon the thighs. The eyes are pointed towards the nostrils, to keep watch lest the breath should find an occasion to escape wholly from the body. They are allowed to place the back against the wall, but the body and limbs are in so distorted a position, that without much practice it is impossible even to stretch them to it. A watch goes regularly round with a light and a scourge to see that they are all in their places, and to discipline such as are out of the proper posture. When any one proves of a licentious disposition, he is expelled the class, and should he be convicted of a commerce with women, they say the punishment is death.\nThis sort of society, although apparently joyless and insipid, may admit of intrigue, and allow room for men of superior parts and address to aspire to places of trust and importance in public concerns, since the government of the whole country, as well as particular districts, is completely in the hands of the priests. They are, in fact, the noblesse of the country, exercising under the sanction of religion a pre-eminence over the common people, on whose labours they entirely subsist, and to whose services on all emergencies they lay claim. I could obtain no estimate of the number of persons composing this order in Boutan, but from the following observations it will appear how large a portion they must form of the entire inhabitants; for, besides those lodged in Tacissudon and other castles, there is scarcely a patch of land to be seen, admitting of considerable cultivation, where there is not a village on some adjacent height, inhabited by these people, who draw their support from the industry of the peasants beneath. These villages being always well built, and the houses lofty and whitewashed, are often beautiful objects as viewed from the road in travelling through the country. Each of these fraternities has its chapel, altar, and Lama-groo, or chief priest, who presides, and sees that the duties of the profession are regularly and properly discharged. There are besides a few who, in the character of faquires, pass their austere and solitary lives in lonely places high up among the rocks and jungle; and in some parts of Boutan are said to be religious societies of female devotees or nuns, who, like the priests, have their superior and other officers, but all of their own sex.* Provisions and necessaries are regularly supplied to them, but no man dares be found after day-light in the precincts of the place, on pain of severe punishment.\n\nTheir belief in the Metempsychosis does not seem in Boutan very strictly adhered to, any further than as it respects the regeneration of the three principal Lamas, Lam-Sebdo, Lam-Geysey, and the Rajah Lam-Rimbochy, than which no religious truth (they say) can possibly be more certain. On some enquiry I made concerning their notions of heaven, I remember the Rajah said he had been there, but his manner of expression seemed to indicate a desire to put an end to that topic of discourse, under an apprehension, perhaps, that he might be asked to give an account of his adventures on the expedition. It is true we had it signified on our arrival that the Rajah\n\n* Such hermits and such nuns, as are here described, exist likewise among the Buddhists of China. J.F.D.\nwould be displeased if we went shooting, but meat and fowls were constantly supplied to our table, and we often saw animals killed for the use of the Gylongs themselves. The spirit of the late superior Lama of Boutan made its appearance at Lassa, and the identity of the person on such occasions, we were informed, is thus determined. On the first discovery of the child, the servants and effects of the deceased Lama are sent for, and laid before him, when if he recognises the former, and challenges the latter as his own, no doubt remains, and he is universally acknowledged and received as the true and individual Lama, whose body they had perhaps a few years before consumed to ashes. His return from Heaven is not confined to any determinate period, but usually happens within the course of ten or eleven years, or rather, perhaps, as it may suit the convenience of those he left behind on earth. It is easy to conceive that the institution of this principle of faith had its rise in political as well as religious motives, to maintain under a proper subjection to the court of the Delai Lama the different countries where this faith is professed; for it must be remembered that the Lama-groo is declared supreme in temporal as well as spiritual matters, although the influence of his former capacity seems considerably on the decline at Teshulombo, from the authority assumed by the Chinese, as well as at Tacissudon, from the disposition to independence manifested by the present Rajah. The name of the young Lama from Lassa is certainly in the mouth of every one, even of the children of Boutan, and he is without exception acknowledged to possess an inherent right to the absolute dominion of the whole country, and that the Deib Rajah is no more than his prime minister, vizier, or dewan; and this claim was no doubt sufficiently enforced when Boutan was more dependent on Thibet, and obliged to receive both chief priest and governor in the person of the young Lama; but at present, I am persuaded to think the Rajah would not be inclined to admit the temporal control, or to share any part of the real authority with another, nor is it likely that the young Lama will at any time hereafter find himself in a condition to assert such a claim. He is occasionally present at ceremonials, but at other times seldom conversed with or seen; and as he grows up to manhood, there is little doubt that the policy of the government will provide that he be still secluded from any interference in public concerns, and wholly confined to the contemplation of his spiritual dignity. He does not even reside at Tacissudon, but is kept at a small\ncastle in an unfrequented place, about a day's journey from thence, among the mountains.*\n\nThe second order of the inhabitants of Boutan, called Zeen-Caabs, are, like the priests, received when young from families in the country, and bred up in the public castles or palaces. Their department lies in the performance of more active duties, and they are very properly styled \"servants of government.\" They attend at the public buildings to see that provisions, firewood, and other necessaries are supplied regularly by the country people, and, in short, *superintend* every public service of labour, which they themselves, however, are exempted from. Two of these, attended by some of the superior class, were on the deputation from the Deib Rajah to the government of Bengal. Another was sent to escort us from Buxaduar to Tacissudon, and to see that we were properly accommodated upon the road; and one was stationed in waiting at our dwelling when we arrived, to be always at hand when any thing was wanted. In war, this class arm themselves and take the field, and are esteemed those on whom the Rajah can most depend for attachment, activity, and courage. They seldom arrive at any office or government of importance, such appointments being always occupied by the priests. They marry and possess farms, and are appointed to preside in some of the inferior districts; but are expected to be ready when called upon for duty, either at the palace or in the field. None of them, however, while residing in the public building where the Gylongs are lodged, can possibly have the society of his family; no females being admitted, except in the day time as coolies with loads, to stay no longer than is necessary for the dispatch of the business they are employed on. The gates of these buildings are regularly closed every evening about dusk.\n\nThe third class, or cultivators, seem to enjoy a more uninterrupted and rational mode of life than either of the former two. They have the comforts of domestic society, and are less liable to be summoned to attend on the pleasure of their superior. In war they must accompany their chief, or any one he may depute, wherever they are ordered, but at other times their condition seems very easy, the principal labour of tillage being performed by a race that can scarcely be called Bouteas; they are evidently a breed mixed with the baser Bengalees, who inhabit towards the foot of the hills, and are distinguishable from the legitimate Bouteas by the difference of\n\n* About eight miles above Tacissudon, where it is said he is to remain three years longer.\ncomplexion and features, and the immoderate filthiness of their bodies and dress. These, with the women of all denominations, whose condition is equally menial and laborious, are the general drudges, and are seldom seen without either a load at their backs, or working in the fields. There being neither wheel-carriages nor cattle trained to transport loads in Boutan, the whole business of carriage is performed on the backs of the human species. I believe the women are in no part of the world treated worse than in Boutan: they seem just tolerated for the indispensable purpose of propagation, and for the labour they can be brought to undergo. In the latter every degree of age and condition is kept constantly engaged, from the child who has just acquired strength to support itself, to the matron who totters with age. The former are seen trudging with their little loaded baskets, and the latter seldom get rid of theirs till death releases them from the burthen. The superior class of the natives are bound by the most solemn injunctions of religion to hold no intercourse with the women, but on the contrary to shun them as objects of mortification and abhorrence; and those from whom they might expect a more tender regard, seem to possess but very imperfectly those sentiments in which consists the enjoyment of conjugal society, and to consider the women as meant by nature to relieve them from the most toilsome offices of life, and to take the largest share of their daily labours. The condition of the women in Thibet is said to be even more humiliating: they are there in so little estimation that the privilege of exclusive possession, which in most other parts of the world is a privilege so tenaciously desired in marriage, is a matter of such indifference, that \"the same wife generally serves a whole family of males, without being the cause of any uncommon jealousy or disunion among them.\" This unworthy treatment of the women in both countries has the effect of rendering them so indifferent to the improvement of their personal charms, that they seldom wash either their clothes or skin. They bear, in short, no comparison in external appearance with the men, who are without exception the best formed, and, allowing for the complexion, the handsomest race I ever saw. Unlike most other countries, Boutan exhibits no difference of rank or circumstance among the women, they being here all alike, the same dirty, labouring objects, and all of them equally in a state of the most abject filthiness and slavery.*\n\n* The Rajah's sister was at Tacissudon. She was lodged in a part of the building appro-\nThe men on the contrary, at least those of the better sort, are much more polished in their manners, and intelligent in their conversation, than might be expected from their little intercourse with other nations. They seem to have strength of intellect, and a freedom of using it, that might make a rapid progress in useful knowledge, were it introduced among them. But of scientific information they are certainly very destitute, although possessed of voluminous treatises in print, which are carefully laid up in some of the chapels as in a library. These books chiefly relate to affairs of religion; they are also said to contain a history of the country, and a code of laws, and the Rajah presented one to Mr. Saunders, which he said comprehends the whole science of medicine: they are printed in a large character on long slips of paper, and the leaves, which are parted when read, are at other times bound up between two flat pieces of board, cut to their size, and ornamented according to the value of that they contain.* In surgery they may, perhaps, have some little skill, and the Rajah himself seems perfectly versed in the Boutan practice of physic. Mr. Saunders said he was surprised to see a difficult case of a fractured skull treated by one of their practitioners with great propriety. The same operator gave a very satisfactory account of the use he made of mercury in venereal disorders. In architecture, I think, they make the best figure: there is a boldness in the design of many of their castles when they are not considered in the character of military buildings; and, with a little more attention to uniformity in the disposal of windows and doors, and such as, perhaps, they think unessential points, these might without partiality be thought perfect in their kind: The projection of the roof is extremely well proportioned to the extraordinary thickness and slope of the walls, and the large projecting balconies are much better adapted than windows to fabrics of so great an area and height. The apartments are lofty and of a good size, and the method of getting into them by ladders, instead of stairs, seems to me the only peculiarity that admits of improvement: but the inconvenience is less felt here, where men only are to mount them, and they take up less room where level ground is so scarce and valuable.\n\n* This is precisely the manner in which the Bud'h priests of China bind up their treatises and prayers, which often open out like a folding screen. J.F.D.\nThe Boutea music consists of long flat notes swelled and sunk with the solemnity of psalm tunes, and they have the faculty of filling their wind instruments, at least to all appearance, with an uninterrupted current of breath. In painting and sculpture they are as far from excelling as the Chinese whom they imitate: of their proficiency in geometry and astronomy I had no means of inquiry. In these, however, as well as every other branch of useful knowledge, it is probable they only want teachers to equal, if not to surpass, their Indian neighbours, over whom they possess an advantage in an exemption from the restraint of caste, that insuperable bar to social improvements and national dignity. A man of merit would be at liberty to pursue the bent of his genius, whatever the employment or profession it might point to; even the priesthood is not confined to any particular rank or age, and men advanced in life sometimes assume the function.* On the approach of an invader, the defence of their little nation would not be entrusted to a small proportion of the inhabitants, who, born in the military tribe, might not be the better adapted by nature to the profession of arms; but the whole would rise together, and the priests turn out for its defence, should the exigency of the case require their assistance. The operations before Wandepore were conducted by a gylong. The Rajah's Dewan, and the Kelidar of Tacissudon, who is also of that order, bear about them the marks of wounds received in former wars.\n\nI have already remarked the superiority of size and justness of form of the Bouteas: they have also a free openness of carriage and an apparent sincerity of behaviour, that might be thought incompatible with the despotism of the government. But the government, although in appearance as absolute as one can be, is not administered with that rigour and injustice which produces an abject servility and meanness in the manners of the people governed; and whether the disposition of mankind is naturally prone to evil, or left on an equipoise between right and wrong, it has as good a chance of turning to the practice of the social duties in Boutan, as in any country in the world: for the natives in their respective classes are so nearly on a level, and have so few means of raising themselves above it, that the passions of envy, hatred, and malice, if not dormant, must be less\n\n* Previous to admission into the order, it is required of the candidate to pass a twelvemonth in preparation, the principal part of which is said to be counting his beads to the repetition of the sentence omanipeemelon.\nfrequently excited there than in the bustle and contention among the inhabitants of more flourishing and affluent nations. Here are neither arts, manufactures, nor commerce, by which individuals have the means of acquiring riches; and the distinctions of attendants, dress, and finery, to awaken the jealousy of their neighbours, are unknown.\n\nOn the death of the Rajah, an assembly is convened of the priests, or, perhaps, the most eminent of them. In what manner their deliberations are conducted, and their opinions and suffrages taken, I have not discovered; but their choice of succession once determined, the person on whom it falls is presented in the name of the assembly with a white handkerchief, and is immediately recognized in possession of the exalted dignity. \u2014No monarch on earth is more absolute, or has fewer actual restraints on his will than the present Rajah, owing partly to the infancy of the superior Lamas.* There is no one with whom he is bound to consult, or who can influence his conduct, except the kelidar, dewan, and others who were perhaps instrumental in his elevation, and in whom he may choose to place confidence. In judicial matters\u2020 he is the last appeal, and his opinion or pleasure ratifies or reverses the decision of inferior tribunals. But yet from the natural free spirit of the people, unbroken by tyranny, and from the respect that is due to the good opinion and venerable characters of the principal gylongs, it would be impossible for him, were he so disposed, to persevere in any flagrant acts of injustice or dangerous schemes of ambition. \u2014The fate of Deib Jedur may be urged in proof of this, and the suppression of the late rebellion shews of what value is popularity among the common people.\n\nThe administration of government must be contained in a narrow compass, as it has so little intercourse with other countries; and, with so circumscribed a commerce, and scanty circulation of coin, there can be but few money transactions, or duties to collect. The rents of the land are chiefly received\n\n* Lam Shabda, said to be twelve years of age, and Lam Geysey, seven years.\n\n\u2020 The zempin, or governor, is the judge in all criminal matters within his district. The accused and the witnesses are confronted and summoned before him, and when the charge has been established, he passes sentence according to a written code of laws. The sentence is referred to the Rajah for confirmation. Certain crimes are punished with the loss of sight:\u2014theft with the loss of a hand:\u2014decapitation is also used; and, in some cases, the criminal is bound hand and foot, and thus thrown into a river.\nin kind, and appropriated to the subsistence of the numerous priests, faquires, and servants of government. The overplus of rice is exported to Thibet, from whence returns are brought in wool, tea, and a few other Chinese commodities; and in the musk, furs, and gold-dust which are carried annually to Rungpore. The Rajah himself is the proprietor of the horses, and the produce of them furnishes no inconsiderable resource for the public exigencies: they are bred in most parts of the country, carefully reared and kept in the Rajah's stables, one of which adjoins to each castle, and from thence they are sent for sale to Bengal, Assam, and Nepal. The imports of tobacco, beetle-nut, dried fish, &c. from Bengal, and the coarse cloths from Assam, are carefully lodged in the castles, as in a public store, and dealt out for the subsistence and use of gylongs, zeen-caabs, and others dependent on the government. The most extensive and unremitting business seems to be that of regulating and superintending the affairs of religion. This, however, may be more in the province of the present Rajah, as in that station he also unites the dignity and office of a superior Lama, and because the other two Lamas, his exalted colleagues, are both children.\n\nIn the month of September is held a grand religious ceremonial, which lasts for twenty days. Most of this time is spent by the gylongs in prayers, confined to the chapel. On the seven last days an exhibition of dancing in masquerade is made in one of the squares of the palace; upon this occasion most of the zempins, or governors of districts, are summoned to Tacissudon, both to be present at the show, and to give an account of their administration. The gylongs and zeen-caabs also receive new clothes, which seem to come very seasonably at a time when the winter is approaching.\n\nWere there any traffic or change of commodities among the natives worth mentioning, it would appear at this annual resort to Tacissudon, in the likeness of a market or fair; but there are seen only about a dozen loads of trifling things exposed to sale in a corner of the palace. If there were more, very few could be found with money to make purchases; neither are there many who have occasion to buy. The gylongs and zeen-caabs receive their food and raiment from the public stores; even their swords or daggers, which the latter wear as finery in their girdles, are in general only lent to them from the palace; and the wants of the common people, besides their daily sustenance, are small indeed. Their dress, composed of a scanty allowance of coarse strong cloth, with a red blanket, when once put on serves them without alteration until it drops to pieces, and they are careful not to hasten\nits dissolution by clearing it from the black and greasy coat of dirt which it soon acquires. Their extreme poverty precludes them from an acquaintance with those eastern luxuries, beetle and tobacco, which, having never enjoyed, they cannot feel the want of.\n\nThe Rajah, according to the probable origin of every chief magistrate, is here still seen merely in the character of trustee to superintend the management of the produce of the country, and to take care that it be justly applied to the subsistence and comfort of the inhabitants; and having so much less than others of the like station to draw aside his attention, it is probable that he acquits himself tolerably of the duty. At home he appears without any parade or throng of attendants, and would be taken rather for the master of a great family than for an independent prince. The prostration is the sole abject mark of subjection that the natives exhibit, and this is only used upon an introduction to the Rajah's presence after considerable absence; at all other times the zeen-caabs, and others of the palace, have access and converse with him without any ceremony, and it is the custom in Boutan for the meanest person, either when introduced, or on taking leave, to be presented with a dish of tea or strong liquor, and to be asked to sit while he drinks it. When the Rajah travels, it is on horseback, preceded by some of the country musicians, and a guard armed with matchlocks; next follow some persons on foot, dressed in ceremonials, with red bushy caps, and a great many led horses.* The Rajah apparently passes his life peaceably and agreeably, alternately moving about to his castles or palaces, of which he has many principal ones, besides the smaller villas, such as that above Ponaka; and so various are the situations and climates of these places, that he may suit his particular constitution or feelings in any season of the year, and by a few days' journey properly directed, experience all the different degrees of temperature between the extremes of Zembla and Bengal.\n\nThat the absence of money in a society excludes, in a proportionate\n\n* The Rajah's principal attendants were, the kelidar, the dewan, and zempin, and a youug man his nephew. They were all gylongs, and by their dress not distinguishable from the other priests. They had their respective apartments in the castle, consisting of a closet, with an altar for devotion, and an anti-chamber. In the latter, which is always hung round with matchlock pieces, and bows and arrows, are commonly seen a few persons in waiting, who attend on their chief when he goes out, which is seldom, unless to the adjacent river to bathe.\ndegree, depravity of morals and vices of various kinds, is in some measure exemplified in Boutan, where there is no other coin than the Beyhar rupee, which finds its way into the country in so scanty a portion, as to leave the natives possess almost of the same advantages with those to whom money is wholly unknown. Under these circumstances, the governors of districts, and others employed under the Rajah, have not the same means of amassing wealth, which in other countries excites peculation and proves the source of the most destructive crimes: for had they ever so much a natural propensity to such practices, insurmountable obstacles would arise to the gratification of their views. An exorbitant levy on the produce of the land would be a transaction impossible to conceal; or if practised with success, the different commodities must perish upon hand, as no means would occur of turning them into money but by exportation, which would require the Rajah's authority and passport. Wealth is, besides, less valuable to an individual in Boutan, than in countries where it not only procures the conveniences of life, but the distinctions due to merit. In Boutan it might create envy, but could not raise the possessor above the rank assigned him in one of the classes before described. The pride of dress and attendants is unknown to all except a few public officers, employed immediately under the Rajah, and the mass of the inhabitants are here more nearly upon an equality than they are in most other civilized parts of the world. The policy of the government seems also calculated to prevent them from changing their condition, or aspiring above their fellows. The dress of a priest is always the same, though he should hold the most distinguished civil employment. The zeen-caabs are all in uniform, nor dare they alter it with the addition of any extraneous finery. Even the embroidered gowns worn by the two of that order at Calcutta, which had been given them by the Rajah, were sold on their return to Buxaduar, being then become useless. They assemble at their meals, and have their provisions dealt out to them. The regulations and customs of the government seem calculated to promote an equal distribution of the gifts of Providence among each class of the inhabitants, and, as the country is certainly not distinguished by any superfluity, to prevent individuals from accumulating an exorbitant share to the prejudice of their countrymen. Ambition and vanity can have no objects of incitement in Boutan, where society is consequently little exposed to the disturbances incidental to the gratification of those passions; and an ease and tranquillity may be supposed to prevail, of a nature not unlike\nthat described in the golden age. The natives are strangers to extortion, cruelty, and bloodshed, in which several vices their Indian neighbours have so eminently distinguished themselves; there being no attainments by which the most licentious can be allured to commit such crimes. We had an instance of a rebellion, successful for some time before it was suppressed, which cost but few lives, and only one of them that could be called an execution, the zempin of Wande pore. Instead of the ferocity and vengeance attendant on civil war, the Bouteas, upon several occasions during the course of the insurrection and attempt against Tacissudon, shewed a tenderness of each other's lives which, without scruple, I should have attributed to their want of courage, had they not given proof of the contrary in their war with us. They are upon the whole an exceeding poor, but, comparatively speaking, a happy people, neither in danger of any very outrageous oppression at home, nor of invasion and slavery from abroad. The nature of their government, entrusted to a set of men who can never have mischievous, sinister, and self-interested schemes of ambition or avarice to prosecute at the expense of the public, exempts them from the first; and the strength of the country, in the uncommon difficulty of the roads, secures them from the second. Food and clothes are found by all, and what little superfluity beyond this the country affords, is so managed as to make the most creditable figure in their different castles; and as this is a public concern, the public in this may be said to enjoy a share.*\n\nBut, after all, these advantages and this happiness are of a negative quality, and not such as would tempt the more enlightened part of mankind to change conditions with the inhabitants of Boutan. They are for ever excluded by the nature of the country from making any considerable progress in arts, manufactures, and commerce, and therefore not likely to acquire any very eminent degree of science, taste, and elegance. They might, it is true, become better soldiers if they were more suitably armed, but such an improvement might only induce them to disturb the peace and invade the property of others, without contributing any needful security to their own,\n\n* Property acquired under the government of Boutan devolves to the Rajah on the proprietor's decease, and becomes a part of the public stock.\n\n'Privatus illis census erat brevis\u2014Commune magnum.'\u2014\nwhich is already, from the unchangeable ruggedness of the country, as unassailable as they can desire.\n\nThe best means of attaining an explanation of the principles of the Boutea religion, might be to translate some of their books on the subject: the ceremonial part would, perhaps, be best observed by a visit to the residence of the Delai Lama. There are ceremonies used at Tacissudon which are unknown at Teshulombo, and it is not unlikely that the Bouteas, from a nearer intercourse with India, may have adopted more abundantly than the Thibetians the articles of Hindoo faith. The natives of Thibet and Boutan differ in the disposal of the dead: the former expose the bodies on a building, erected for the purpose, to the action of the weather, and to be devoured by birds of prey;* but in Boutan they are reduced to ashes as in India.\u2020 I saw one upon the funeral pile, but did not arrive till some time after the fire had been applied. About a dozen of gylongs sat in front under a shed (it being rainy weather) muttering prayers. At intervals their religious instruments were sounded, and an attendant was often sent with spoonfuls of oil and other consecrated articles to throw into the flame. The women are said to receive the last office from the gylongs at their death, although so much slighted by them during their lives. The Bouteas have likewise an imitation of the machine used in India, commonly called a swammy-coach; but from never making wheels except on such occasions, they are so awkwardly contrived, as to perform but very imperfectly their intended office. A ceremony of this kind happened soon after our arrival at Tacissudon, in consequence of the decease of a very eminent priest of that class who, devoting their lives to the austere duties of religion, retire to some solitary habitation among the mountains. Finding his end draw nigh, he expressed a wish to see the Rajah, and, as we were informed, advertised him of disturbances shortly to happen in his government, and warned him to avert both the calamities of war, and an impending blow with which he himself was threatened, by imploring the protection of the deity in a solemn and public invocation. These troubles were probably foreseen by others as well as the old gylong, for the prediction was understood to mean the insurrection occasioned by the zempin of Wande pore. A pyramidal pile was formed near the bank of the river, composed of slips of wood,\n\n* This is like the Parsecs. \u2020 The Budh' priests of China burn their dead likewise.\u2014J.F.D.\nstained papers, worsted of various colours wound upon frames, and other showy articles, the whole erected upon a frame of timber which had under it four clumsy wheels or rollers. The lower part was decorated with an abundance of ornaments and images of the deities, arranged in the manner of an altar, before which were placed upon the ground some larger figures moulded in clay, and painted to represent the deceased Lama, the Rajah, his dewan, and some of his principal attendants. When the fabric was completed, a large tent was pitched in its front, of a size to contain more than four hundred gylongs, who marched out of the palace to officiate therein.\n\nA small pavilion was built for the Rajah behind the pyramid, in a square inclosure of young trees. One whole night and part of the next day was spent in prayer, and in sounding the religious horns and drums. When this was ended, the gylongs moved away to a small island to bathe, leaving the pyramid to be disposed of by the throng of spectators, who, after many ineffectual attempts to drag it close to the river-side, which was impossible from the clumsiness of the wheels, fell upon it with enthusiastic fury, pulled it to pieces, and threw the fragments into the stream, the Rajah himself remaining upon the spot until the work of destruction was completed.\n\nThe same person directed that his image should, after his decease, be deposited in the hermitage upon the mountain, and it was accordingly carried in procession, placed on a sort of bier supported by four priests, and attended by others chanting prayers, with musical instruments, perfumes, and torches.\n\nSome time after the above transactions, and on one of the bathing days, a ceremonial was performed upon the bank of the river, which had the appearance of being an offering to the stream. The approach of the priests from the castle was announced by three musicians who preceded the line. One of these beat upon the cymbal, another had an instrument like a hautboy, and the third a tabret or drum. In front came Lam-keb, before whom was carried a chalice with perfumes, and about twenty of those following next in order carried, each of them, something concealed under a covering of embroidery and silks of various showy colours, and they had all white handkerchiefs tied round their mouths. Next came the usual number of gylongs, amounting to upwards of four hundred, the youngest bringing up the rear. They passed the bridge and sat down in a throng upon the grass under the willows, on that side the river opposite our dwelling, with\ntheir faces to the water; while the loads were placed in a row close upon the edge of the bank. Some prayers were muttered, and every one produced his dish, which was filled with tea by zeen-caab attendants, who also presented each gylong with a piece of melon. When they had drank their tea, eat the piece of melon, and when those charged with the loads had again bound up their mouths, they all rose up, took off the embroidered cloths, and at a signal tumbled the articles which had been covered into the stream. These articles proved to be only large stones, and lumps of clay: I suppose consecrated for the occasion.\n\nIn the month of September is held an annual religious festival which lasts about twenty days. The ceremonies during the former part of the time consist of muttering prayers in the principal chapel, which is decked out for the occasion. A temporary altar is raised in the middle of it, adorned with silk flags and handkerchiefs of various colours, and other showy articles. The front of the gallery, and some of the pillars, were hung round with religious ensigns of satin, embroidered and painted, and not inelegantly disposed; and two other pillars supported martial trophies composed of arms of various kinds. A matchlock of an uncommon size formed the centre of each; some Indian pikes (for they have none of their own) and European muskets, with the bayonets fixed, contributed to form the body of the piece, which was terminated with lighter weapons, with swords, shields, and bows and arrows. On one side of the chapel stood a row of figures fantastically dressed as warriors, and on the floor sat the priests, disposed in ranks perpendicular with the front of the altar. One half of the number of ranks faced the other half, leaving a wide passage up the middle in which lay their large tabrets or drums. Before each priest was placed a small bell, and an instrument composed of a piece of wood, about a palm in the length, with an ornament at each end, shaped something like a little crown. These they often used, taking the bell in one hand and the wooden instrument in the other, presenting them forward with the inside of the hand turned upwards as they muttered their prayers. Lam-keb, who is fourth in rank, and commandant of gylongs, sat fronting the altar, and gave the word and signal for every thing that was done. I continued to view them about half an hour from the window below, and from the gallery above, and should have staid longer had the operations appeared to admit of any variety.\n\nThe season of praying being over, the exhibition of dancing began, and\nwas performed entirely by the gylongs in their quadrangle of the palace. In one of the lower galleries or virandas an orchestra was partitioned off with silk curtains, where sat, upon a raised seat, thirteen gylongs dressed in satin robes, with large embroidered caps, such as are worn by the Lamas, in shape resembling a mitre. Lam-keb sat in the middle, and led the band, beating time with cymbals, while each of the others struck with a bent iron upon a drum which was held by an attendant standing behind. The galleries and the sides of the quadrangle were crowded with spectators, among whom was the Rajah with his principal officers. A silk curtain was hung across before the chapel door, from whence, as from behind scenes, came out twenty figures fantastically but uniformly dressed, with broad brimmed hats, not unlike shields, tied upon the head, bordered with black fur and adorned with a high ornament or plume rising from the crown, and with tassels of handkerchiefs of different colours, tied to the crown, and hanging down low behind. Over the shoulders was a tippet of gold and silver embroidery on the borders, and hanging half before and half behind. The gown or vest was of satin, girded round the waist, with a white handkerchief tucked in on each side. The sleeves were large, widening from the shoulder downwards to the hand. Round both the skirts of the gown, and the middle of the sleeves, was a broad stripe of red, brodered with a narrower one of yellow. Fourteen of these figures formed a circle, and the other five a smaller one within it; each person carried a tabret in the left hand, which he beat with a bent iron, touching it lightly first on one side, then on the other, as he danced about. The motions practised by these dancers were chiefly throwing themselves round upon one leg, at the same time tossing up the head, and flourishing with the arms, then sinking with an inclination of the body as they came to the ground. Every dancer kept his place, and the whole circle moving round with uniform gestures as they touched the tabrets together, their plumes and handkerchiefs or streamers flying loosely in the air, had a theatrical effect. After entertaining the spectators about half an hour in this way, they danced in one after the other to the chapel, and disappeared. Some of the audience then struck up a devout song, much in the style of our church psalms, the verses being given out by an old gylong.\n\nThe next dance was in masquerade. First came out a figure representing the destroying power, whose visage is grimly enraged and surrounded with skulls. To the former music were added deeper toned drums, with gruff\nhorns, and bells, to give the scene a more terrific effect. This figure was presently followed by six in the same dress, who came out in pairs, and by two who joined them afterwards. One of these had a head like a frog, the other wore a pale mask not unlike a sign-painter's representation of the full moon. Their motions were of the same kind as the preceding, but more brisk and more animated. A mat was spread in the middle of the square, and a small vessel placed upon it, round which the actors huddled together, as witches would have done round a cauldron, and when they had exercised themselves for about an hour in this mode, they danced in behind the curtain and the show ended for the first day.\n\nThe next morning the orchestra was filled as before, and the Rajah with his attendants took their places to behold the show, which opened with a grinning figure, the same as above-described, who was soon joined by thirteen more, five of whom had masks like the heads of hogs and tigers, and the other eight were masked with monstrous gaping beaks. The whole together presented a collection of more fiend-like visages than ever painter represented in the temptation of Saint Antony, and the wild and clamorous sound of the instruments seemed well adapted to make such devils dance. Every mask was garnished with little ivory skulls, and each figure held a symbolic instrument in either hand. The dresses were in other respects the same as on the preceding day. After flourishing about with \"mops and mowes\" for an hour they disappeared. Four figures only came out next. They danced for some time round a mat that had a small triangular vessel placed upon it. They were then joined by those that had been seen before, in all amounting to twenty-one. What followed was dancing, such as we had been already entertained with, and the second day's amusement closed.\n\nThe third day was too nearly a repetition of the former two to deserve a particular discription; the same masks danced again in the same manner, with the addition of a few more to the number.\n\nOn the fourth day the dancing was performed in the chapel before the temporary altar, the Rajah and Lam Geysey were present, and the common people were admitted to be spectators from the gallery above. The performers were the first set only: they held various symbolic instruments, instead of tabrets, and had not room for so much agility as was shewn without in the square. When it was over, the Rajah and Lam Geysey came forth on the way to their respective apartments. The latter answered the\ndescription I had received of him, appearing to be a boy of about seven years of age. He was carried on the shoulders of a priest, and the gylongs, as he passed, stopped and made an obeisance.\n\nThe fifth day was a repetition of the first.\n\nOn the sixth day a dance was performed by four figures with masks representing skulls. The body and limbs were fitted closely with a white dress, and round the middle hung various coloured handkerchiefs and fringes. Their motions were more slow and solemn than before, and sometimes accompanied with a tremulous shaking of the limbs. They withdrew and returned again, bringing forth a hair cloth, held between them at each corner, containing a triangular vessel, round which they danced and quivered for some time, and then disappeared.\n\nThe seventh day closed the festival with an exhibition more splendid than any of the preceding. The orchestra was filled with an additional number of Lamas, and a procession commenced of the superior deity, in his character of Wizie Rimbochy, with many attendants, and with the grinning figures already described. The dresses were extremely rich and showy, and the figures moved on in slow and solemn pace round the square. Wizie Rimbochy had an umbrella held over him, kept constantly twirling, and six inferior personages huddled round him as agents or domestics, awaiting his commands. He turned entirely round many times on the way, as if surveying the multitude with his smiling, gilded countenance, and afterwards took his seat upon a bench covered with carpets in front of the chapel, and his attendants, after dancing for some time, seated themselves on each side. Sixteen figures then made their appearance in dresses very different from any of the former. These, as I was informed, personated females. Each of them wore a gilded coronet, the hair from under it falling in tresses upon the shoulders. Their robes were of the brightest coloured satin, girded round the waist with a white ornament formed of something like gimp, which hung with tassels before. The bosom was crossed over, and the sleeves tied up with some of the same material. They held painted tabrets in one hand, which they touched lightly to time with a bent iron in the other, and moved round the square with solemn, uniform, and graceful steps. When arrived opposite Wizie Rimbochy, and the company seated on the bench, they drew up facing them, and sung something like an hymn, occasionally separating and returning again to the same position, often bowing and falling on their knees as in adoration. They re-\ntired for a while, and came out again with rattles in their hands, instead of tabrets, and continued the same movements until Wizie Rimbochy and his attendants advanced and took another circuit round the square; the different masks flourishing about at the same time according to their respective characters. The contrast between the graceful figures just described, and those with fiend-like visages, was not unentertaining, and the whole scene, including the spectators who crowded the sides of the square and the galleries, together with the rude noise of the instruments sounding from different quarters, had a wild and theatrical effect, but not of a nature that could be well initiated on any stage. In the course of the performance the Kelidar and several other personages of note, who were on this occasion at Tacissudon, went, and standing in a row made three prostrations before Wizie Rimbochy, as he was seated upon the bench, and presented their handkerchiefs. When the performance had ended, the Rajah, followed by the gylongs, adjourned to one of the largest chapels, and took his seat on a pedestal or throne placed in front of the altar, with Lam Geysey on his right hand and Lam Keb on his left, each on separate seats something lower than that placed for the Rajah. The gylongs squatted in rows upon the floor. What passed here I was not allowed to see, but I understood that the ceremony consisted chiefly of eating and drinking, as the priests came out each with a portion of fruit in his hand. The zeen-caabs were at the same time regaled with liquors in the gallery. They said it was usual for a benediction to be conferred by Wizie Rimbochy on the multitude, who approach one by one to make their obeisance and to receive it, but on this occasion it was not observed.*\n\nA festival of the same kind is held at Ponaka, Paragong, and Wandepore, but the Rajah said there is no such dancing used at Thibet. He did not seem willing to enter upon an explanation of what had been exhibited, and the account given by others was neither satisfactory nor perfectly intelligible, but by what little could be gathered from them it has an allegorical meaning, which refers to some former calamity, when the country was invaded and the inhabitants devoured by monsters, such as they imitate in masquerade, commissioned by an adverse deity for this mischievous purpose.\n\n* The dewan and the darogah, with a party of zeen-caabs, patrolled every day round the square while the performances lasted, to maintain order.\nOn the interposition of Wizie Rimbochy, compassionate of the people's sufferings, and at their humble supplication, these plagues were withdrawn. These annual rites are therefore performed in honour of Wizie Rimbochy, and to implore continuance of his protection, that the people may prosper, and not again be delivered over to any such infernal agents.\n\nThe Bouteas have stories of flying dragons, and of nations of monsters, which they say are fully treated of in some of their religious tracts. A dragon is sometimes seen upon a rock near Ponaka, and the Rajah's interpreter told me very gravely, that a young one of the same breed had been caught upon a mountain, and was still kept very carefully by the gylongs among the sacred things in the chapel. A ceremony, which by only a few weeks preceded the last, should not be omitted, as it seemed of some important meaning, although there was no getting it intelligibly explained.\n\nWe were alarmed early one morning with the firing of matchlocks from the roof of the castle by about twenty persons, who, when they descended, were found completely dressed in chain armour, with steel caps, from each of which rose a plume of feathers. They formed a wide circle in the gylong court round a capacious vessel of liquor, and, as they marched round it, one of the number continued giving out verses of eight syllables, which the rest repeated after him, often capering and flourishing their swords. All the explanation they would give of this business was, that it was proper to be done for the good of the country.\n\nThe wild and domestic animals of Boutan are some of them peculiar to the hills, and the rest such as are equally found in Bengal. The horses come under the former denomination, and are so well known as to need no description; they seem of the same species as those brought from Acheen, which are so much used on the coast of Coromandel, and are smaller and better adapted to the nature of the country than those from Thibet, of which there are many at Tacissudon. The native horned cattle, to all outward appearance, are the same species with those of England, except where the breed has been mixed with that of Bengal, and in this case the hump between the shoulders is perceptible. Of sheep, I believe they have no other than what are occasionally brought from Thibet. I never met with any, but my companions once saw a few near Tacissudon. Goats they have in plenty, which differ in no respect from those of India. The hogs are a small breed imported from Rungpore and Cooch Beyhar. The Bouteas use more of this than of any other sort of animal food. The dogs\nare the common Paria sort, with others of a different kind from Thibet. These last are of a large size, with a sharp snout and a fox-like head, long shagged hair, of a strong make, ugly, and extremely fierce. They are always kept chained, and serve as guards to the villages and orchards. In some of the woods we saw monkeys of an extraordinary size, the face black, and surrounded with white bushy hair; the hair on the body grey. In the woods to the northward are said to be bears, and the cheeta, or hunting leopard. In Boutan are plenty of fowls, but neither ducks, geese, nor turkeys, wild or tame: it is too cold a climate for the latter, and the others would nowhere find water sufficiently placid to swim in. Pigeons both wild and tame; sparrows, kites, and crows from India. The latter however speak a different language from their low country relations, and in some of their notes might be mistaken for ducks. A bird found in the greatest plenty is the hoppoo, a native also of India, but nowhere seen so numerous as here. The size rather smaller than a pigeon; a long beak; the plumage beautifully variegated with brown, white, and black, and a high tuft of feathers on the head, which is expanded and elevated, or closed and depressed at pleasure. The cuckoo was heard no more after the setting in of the rains, but he returns at the same season and stays as long as he does in England. There are also wag-tails and tom-tits, and I once saw a humming bird of a very beautiful plumage, red, blue, and yellow. The gnats which tormented us at Choka, as well as the luckes, are, I believe, met with in no other country. The bite of the former is much more tormenting than that of any other species of mosquito I ever heard of; the pain lasts at least a week, and the marks much longer: they were visible for a month after our arrival at Tacissudon. The Bouteas are plentifully stocked with rats, fleas, bugs, and mosquitos, but I believe snakes and the like venomous reptiles are nowhere seen, except in the southern parts bordering on Bengal.\n\nWe staid at Tacissudon upwards of three months, and remained all the time lodged in the house we were shewn to on our arrival. The daily supply for our table was a kid, three fowls, and about a dozen eggs, which was neither varied, increased, nor diminished, except once or twice when the Rajah sent some of the dried mutton from Thibet. We had occasionally good butter, and after a while were brought to disregard the hairs and dirt with which it was abundantly mixed. The servants, except two or three of the upper class, were not so well off: their portion was two dried fish, a\nlittle rice and flour each, and sometimes a goat divided among them;\u2014this, however scanty when compared with more plentiful countries, was by no means an illiberal allowance at Boutan, where meat is so scarce, and sparingly consumed. We had fruit sent from the castles, but vegetables were difficult to be met with. Turnips are a native root, although they do not grow in the same perfection as in Europe. The potatoes which Bogle left must have been neglected, for there were none on our arrival. We had strawberries and raspberries, and in the beginning of July apricots, from, I believe, the only tree in the country. At the latter end of August the pears and peaches begin to ripen, and by the middle of September they are in the greatest perfection at Boutan, but certainly inferior to those of Europe. It must, however, be observed that the Bouteas are ignorant of the art of engrafting, and never either prune the trees or thin them when overloaded; neither do I believe that they consider much the soil or aspect. Were they skilled in these points, and desirous of the trial, there is scarcely a vegetable production in any quarter of the globe which might not be cultivated with success in some part or other of Boutan. But perhaps it is more suitable that, in their present simplicity, they remain occupied in the production of what nature more immediately craves, since there is so little ground to spare for speculative purposes.\u2014Except in the Rajah's orchards, the fruit seems to be at the disposal of the public, and we found it impossible to preserve that which hung upon the few trees near our dwelling until it was fit to gather.\u2014The melons from Ponaka were good, and the pomegranates the finest I ever beheld. In October the oranges there and at Wande pore ripen, and are laid up for a winter store.\n\nThe situation of Tacissudon, elevated into so pure a region of the air, must certainly be healthy in every season of the year; even in the rains, as there is no place where water can lodge and become stagnate, neither is the surface so closely covered with wood as to produce unwholesome vapour.\n\nThe weather on our arrival was delightful. The mornings and evenings clear, and the air sharp. I never slept under less than a quilt, blanket, and a great coat. Early in June the rains set in, and were so constant that during an interval of seven or eight days that we were at Ponaka, there generally fell a shower in some part or other of the twenty-four hours, and the tops of the hills were constantly involved in clouds. The rivers and torrents swell in this season, but the roads are never impassable, unless for a short time, by the demolition of a bridge or a slip of the earth, which is\nsoon repaired. About the middle of September the wet season ends, and the weather continues fine till November, when the snow begins to fall and to whiten the mountains. The Bouteas then put on their blankets and boots, and the Rajah and his attendants retire from Tacissudon to a milder climate in the valley of Ponaka, which must be during the winter months a charming residence. The whole face of the country would be found at this time to wear the most curious and interesting aspect, and to afford scenes for a painter in a style truly sublime, but of which words could convey but a very inadequate idea.\n\nTo call this a mountainous country merely would not sufficiently distinguish it from others of a like denomination, nor give a proper impression of its true character, when that term is understood to imply an intermixture of hills and valleys. But if a country of mountains be an intelligible phrase, it may with great justice be applied to Boutan, or at least to that part of it through which I have travelled.\nXXV. Observations on the Oriental Origin of the Romnichal, or Tribe miscalled Gypsey and Bohemian; by Colonel John Staples Harriot, Bengal Infantry.\n\nRead December 5, 1829, and January 2, 1830.\n\nDuring my residence in North Hampshire, in the years 1819-20, I was led to pay considerable attention to a race of vagrant men, who, roaming about the high roads and lanes in the vicinity of Waltham, Overton, and Whitchurch, appear almost to be out of the protection of the law (whether in this or any other country), and are known throughout the world under the varied names\u2014\n\nin England ... of Gypsey.\nScotland .........

Nath, Beria, and Kanjar.\nThe Gypsies are possessed of a language, hitherto so much unknown, as to be vulgarly designated 'cant,' or 'canting.'\n\nThe English word 'Gypsey' is corrupted from Egyptian, and originates in the vulgar error of Egypt being their native place; the same people being called in France, for a similar reason, 'Egyptien and Bohemien,' because, when first noticed as jungleurs, jugglers, and minstrels, in the vicinity of Paris, they said that they came from the respective countries of Egypt and Bohemia.\n\nNathan Bailey, the lexicographer, and Skinner, call them \"a crew of pilfering stragglers, who rove up and down the country, under pretence of being Egyptians, and tell people their fortunes.\"*\n\nThe history of this singular people, although spread or rather scattered over the greater part of the Old World, is very little known; arising evidently from the erratic life they lead, their forlorn appearance, their poverty, and apparent wretchedness. Comparatively speaking, we may say of this strange society that, without house or home, without national or kindred ties, and almost without religious rites, without any communication with those of a similar denomination and mode of life, either on the European or Asiatic continent, they still maintain nearly the same customs, habits, and principles of conduct; the same language, and means of supporting themselves; the same general spirit of independence and freedom from control: a race of men who, in all climates, take, it may be said, from choice\n\n\"This frantic dress, and make the earth their bed.\"\n\nThey are dispersed over the face of Europe, the greater part of Asia, and a part of Africa; but, without letters or a vestige of science, they are everywhere the same unchangeable race of beings; the same in appearance, manners, habits, and language; whether in England, Spain, Bohemia, the Deserts around Aleppo, the Plains of Persia, or of India.\n\nTheir real name in England, and that by which they exclusively call themselves, is Romnichal; their language Romanes:\u2020 and in tracing their origin these terms should be remembered.\n\n* Errones nequissimi Gallis nomine \u00c6gyptiorum, et Bohemorum, Italis Zingarorum notissimi proculdubio, sic dicti, quia ob subnigrum, Fuscum colorem \u00c6gyptii vulgo credebantur.\u2014Skinner. Etymologicon Angl.\n\n\u2020 The Germans call this language 'Rotwelsch;' hoc est rubrum barbarissimum.\u2014Munster.\nTheir language is partly, perhaps chiefly, Oriental, and partly mixed with the dialects of those countries they have passed through, as may be clearly demonstrated by the short vocabulary affixed, taken verbatim in Hampshire, and illustrated with a number of synonyms inserted from the Hindu, Persic, and Sanskrita.\n\nIn Germany their first appearance, as Sir Thomas Browne remarks, was since A.D. 1400: and they were not observed before in any other part of Europe.\n\nMunster and Spelman fix this period as being ... A.D. 1417.\nIn Switzerland, they appeared or were noticed .......... 1422.\nIn Italy ......................................................... 1422.\nIn France .......................................................... 1427.\nIn England as early as the reign of Henry the Eighth.\n\nAt these periods, they assumed the character of pilgrims and penitents, for the sake of being well received, both by the governing powers and by the people of the country.\n\nThe appearance of the Gypsies in Germany, Italy, &c. in the fifteenth century being noticed by Dulick, Sir Thomas Browne, and Muratori, disproves the testimony of those writers who consider them to be \"the followers of one Zinganeus, who was banished Egypt, A.D. 1517, by Sultan Selim; and whose party agreeing to disperse themselves over the world, they thence derive the name Zinganee.\" This deduction is sufficiently disproved by the anachronism as to the date of their dispersion in Egypt, and appearance in Europe; and, on the other hand, Ralph Volaterianus affirms, that \"they first proceeded from among the Uxii, a people of Persis or Persia.\" Again, Foroliviensis, in the nineteenth volume of Muratori's History of Italy, observes, that \"on the 4th August 1422, two hundred of the Cingari came to his native town, on their way to Rome; and some of them said, that they were from India: \"et ut audivi, aliqui dicebant, quod erant in India.\" Munster corroborates this account from the information he gathered of one of the Cingari, in A.D. 1524; at which period, also, an impression existed among them of their having come from that country.\n\n* Romnichal; I was favoured with the following derivation by Dr. C. Wilkins: Ramna, Hindi; 'a park, plain, or champagne;' and chal, 'a rover, wanderer, traveller;' or perhaps, Rumna, 'to roam,' and chal, 'habit or manner.'\nIn A.D. 1560 they were expelled from France; in 1591 from Spain; in 1530, by a statute of Henry the VIIIth, and subsequently by others of Mary and Elizabeth, \"an outlandish people, calling themselves Egyptians, using no craft or feat of merchandise,\" were outlawed and banished from England, on pain of death; but, notwithstanding these and other sanguinary laws, the Gypsies* still wander over the face of the country.\n\nIn France, as well as in the Austrian dominions, frequent violent attempts have been made to force them to quit their singular mode of life; but even the absolute power of Maria Theresa, and of the Emperor Joseph, was unable to overcome their invincible dislike to \"house-dwelling,\" as they emphatically term a settled life; or to obliterate the love of that rude, unostentatious sort of liberty they command; the enjoyment of which, not all the inducements of wealth, of luxury, or domestic comfort, can tempt them to forego; so true it is, that \"amid the revolution of ages, national character seems induced with unconquerable vitality, and retains to the last its original peculiarities.\"\u2020\n\nBurn, in his popular treatise, under the title 'Vagrant,' mentions what classes of people in England shall be deemed by law rogues and vagabonds. Under the eighth section he classes, \"persons pretending to be Gypsies, wandering in the habit or form of Egyptians, who are a strange commonwealth of impostors and jugglers, originally called Zinganees by the Turks.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Baronius observes of the same tribe of people, \"that no part of the world is free from those banditti, wandering about in troops, whom we, by mistake, call Egyptians and Bohemians. When we were at Cairo, and in the villages bordering on the Nile, we found troops of these strolling thieves, sitting under palm trees; and they are esteemed foreigners in Egypt, as well as among us.\" Leo Africanus mentions the same tribe inhabiting the interior of Africa, and plundering the merchants of Agades.\n\nSwinburne, in his travels, notices the Italian Gypsey; Russel, in his account of Aleppo, those of Syria; and Bright, a later tourist, those of Hungary\u2014giving a considerable list of words and sentences used both by the Hungarian and Spanish Gypsey.\n\nIn corroboration of the opinion of Baronius, the English Encyclopedia,\n\n---\n\n* Until the 23d year of the reign of King George the IIIrd it was felony without benefit of clergy, to be seen for one month together in the company of persons calling themselves Egyptians. F.W.A.\n\n\u2020 Vide Edinb. Rev. Dec. 1818.\nunder the article \"Gypsey,\" has a remark, that \"their language differs entirely from the Coptic, and that their customs are very different from those of the Egyptians.\"\n\nThe surnames most prevalent in Hampshire, are those of Stanley, Aires, Lee, and Peters. Their complexion, eyes, and hair are dark, and of that nature we might expect from their Oriental origin. To strangers they appear reserved, but not so to those who treat them with general kindness: many of them have served in the army, and, I believe, some few as sailors.\n\nIn Europe, their employments, avocations, and customs, appear to be generally as follow:\n\n1. Basket and mat making; fabricating needles, bodkins, nets, carpets, seives, besoms, and foot-bosses; grinding and cutlery; turning or making troughs, trenchers, dishes, and spoons; farriery and horse-dealing; braziery: and in the summer they are occasionally employed in the fields, reaping, weeding, and hop-picking.\n\n2. Feats of dexterity, as jugglers' tricks, wrestling, single stick, dancing, singing, and music.\n\n3. Palmistry and soothsaying, fortune-telling, astrology, chiromancy, and exorcism.\n\n4. Begging, poaching, pilfering, and stealing: although, on the latter head, it may be observed that they are countenanced by their more settled neighbours.\n\n5. They sit on the ground rather than on chairs and stools.\n\nThe circumstance of their living under tents, blankets, or mats, in barns, sheds, or caves; their invariable antipathy to houses; their dislike of agriculture, and the harder kinds of manual labour; their love of an erratic life, and toleration of religion, or rather indifference to religious rites and forms, with a similarity of language, seem common to all, and constitute the most prominent feature in their individual and national character. In short, as of the ancient Bedouin of the desert, it may be truly said of them, \"every man's hand is against them, and their's is against every man;\" since the term house-dweller,* like Ajami or Gentile to the Jew and\n\n* The following anecdote was communicated to me by Mr. Leadbeater, of Overton, Hants. \"On the 5th June 1809, I was sent to attend Barbara Ayres in her accouchement. I found her under one of their usual tents; and in the space of an hour after my arrival she was delivered of a female child. The first thing which suggested itself to me, was the necessity of removing her into a house, where she might receive that attention her situation required. A horse\nthe Arab, Barbaros or Barbarian to the Greek and Roman, and the name of 'alien,' in English jurisprudence, implies with them something foreign and inimical.\n\nMr. Williams, travelling through Russia some few years ago, saw several families of the Gypsey tribe in Siberia. In my own late journey* through Poland and the southern provinces of Russia towards Persia, I heard of them everywhere: they can only enter Gallicia or reside in it by trespass, since these wanderers are banished from the country by an order of government.\n\nColonel Wm. Francklin, accompanying the British mission under the late General Keopler in 1799, from London to Constantinople, observed, during his progress through Hungary and Transylvania, numerous bodies of Gypsies, particularly in the neighbourhood of Buda and Hermanstaadt. Their habitations were underground in caves; and each family resided in a single one. Passing through the villages, Colonel Francklin frequently saw them resorting to inns, for the purpose of merriment and entertaining the spectators; and observed them also in the kitchens, dancing and singing their wild songs, accompanied with gestures that appeared almost frantic. Their complexions resembled those of their brethren whom he had seen in India, Persia, Turkey, and other parts of Europe, being swarthy, with black eyes and black hair.\n\nThe Zingari of Persia.\u2014The following are the few particulars I gleaned during my journey through that country, regarding the Zingari. They are designated commonly by the name of Luli,\u2020 \u0644\u064a\u0644\u064a, and Kauli, \u06a9\u0627\u067e\u0644\u06cc.\n\nIn the extensive province of Azerbijan they are called Karachi, a Turkish\n\n---\n\nhorse and cart, with a bed in it, were sent to convey her to the parish workhouse; but, on reaching the tent, to my great surprize, she was very indignant at our thinking that, under any circumstances, she would ever sleep under the roof of a dwelling-house: her words were, 'she never had, nor never would.' The following night a tremendous storm of wind, rain, and thunder came on; the tent under which she lay was blown over the hedge; and for two hours she was exposed to the violence of the storm, without suffering the least after inconvenience.\n\n\"It should be observed, that the early part of the month of June 1809 was unusually severe.\"\n\n* A.D. 1821.\n\n\u2020 \"Luli,\" A people in Persia called Karachi; handsome boys and girls.\n\n\"Lulian,\" Nice, delicate; a public singer, a strumpet.\"\u2014Richardson's Pers. Dict.\n\nThis word was known in Persia at least as early as Hafiz, who wrote and sung 562 years ago.\n\nFaghan'kin Lulian, &c.\nword signifying 'black' or 'swarthy,' from kara, 'black,' with the participial termination chi as an affix. The Luli are found in the greatest number in Kurdistan; although they migrate from one end of Persia to another, moving towards what is called Garmasir, or the warmer provinces, in the winter months, and returning northward during the spring and summer.\n\nMr. Cormick, an English surgeon, attached to the Prince Royal Ab\u0101s Mirza at Tabr\u012bz, and to whom I am much indebted for the information his long residence in Persia enabled him to afford me, describes the Kar\u0101chi or Kauli of Azerbij\u0101n and Kurdistan as being found mostly in the vicinity of towns, villages, and inhabited places. They live like the wandering tribes called Il or Ily\u0101t, without having any connection with them. They are a perfectly distinct race of people from the latter; move about in tents, have no fixed place of residence, and lead the same unsettled mode of life which they are observed to do in European countries. The men, for the most part, employ themselves in tending their flocks, fabricating mats, wicker-work, namad or felt-cloths, and carpets, and still more in making sieves, riddles, and such like articles. They also pass their time in begging, fortune-telling, and chiromancy; dancing, singing, and tumbling are also practised by them, and appear to be the chief means by which they first engage the attention of those who pass within their reach. In autumn they quit the Sardisar, or cold mountainous region of Azerbij\u0101n.\n\nThroughout Irak Ajami, at Ispah\u0101n, Shir\u0101z, and every intermediate place, to which my personal inquiries extended, the same account was given me of this singular people. In the former province, Kauli is the name by which they are best known. In F\u0101rs they are goldsmiths and smiths. In Kurdistan their families are numerous; and the young women of this tribe, with their dark eyes, black hair, and their well-formed swarthy figures, their musical art, and other blandishments, often put the traveller's heart in danger. They deal in palmistry; and, as in England,\n\n\"the village maid\nSeeks the dark Gypsey's fearful aid.\"\n\nThe celebrated Fateh Ali-Kh\u0101n, of Tehr\u0101n, whose acquaintance with the history, customs, and manners of Persia is perhaps unequalled, told me that, according to the best information he could procure, four thousand of the Luli of Persia were brought into that country some fourteen hundred years ago, by Bahr\u0101m Gor, the reigning monarch, who wanted musicians,\nand sent for them to Kabul, the northernmost province of Hindustan; thence they derive their origin and name, with their swarthy features, dark eyes, and ebon hair. From Persia they were subsequently scattered over Syria, and Egypt.\n\nThis account is so ingenious, and at the same time probable, that I cannot but credit the narration, which, from its simplicity, satisfies me much more than the detailed etymology given by the Persian Mull\u0101 to Sir John Chardin of the same subject, a hundred and fifty years ago. My reason for yielding an assent to the present poet laureate, Fateh Ali-Kh\u0101n\u2019s narrative, is, that the Nat\u2019, of India, leads the same wandering life there, which the Kauli does in Persia, and the Gypsey in Europe. In each of these countries, they had, and still have, the same unsettled, roving, and apparently idle habits; they practise the same feats of dexterity,\u2020 the same arts of music, dancing, and palmistry; and the name of Kauli, which some well informed men derive, by an easy change of the labials v and b, from Kabul, and adjectively K\u0101bul\u012b, indicates even the province of India whence their emigration commenced.\n\nIn Belochistan, a province bordering upon the river Indus, and forming the south-east boundary of Persia, there is at present a similar tribe, also called Luri, a corruption of Luli, or rather vice versa. They are described as being fond of a wandering life, devoid of controul, indolent, and thievish.\n\n* Sir John Malcolm, in his History of Persia, cites a MS. Persian history, A.D. 420, called Zin\u0101tu\u2019t Tav\u0101r\u012bkh, and observes,\u2014it was under Bahr\u0101m-Gur, that minstrels and musicians were first introduced into that kingdom to the number of twelve thousand. Sir John is of opinion there were always a few of this class in Persia, but that since the days of Bahr\u0101m they have abounded; adding, \u201cit is a curious fact, that the dancing and singing girls of Persia are termed K\u0101zoulee, a corruption of C\u0101bul\u012b, Cabul.\u201d Vide Vol. I. p. 117.\n\n\u2020 Juvenal, enumerating the fortune-tellers and astrologers who frequented Italy in the first and second centuries of the Christian era, mentions distinctly the Phrygian and Indian juggler:\n\n```\n......................frontemque, manumque\nPr\u00e6bebit, voti crebrum poppysmo roganti,\nDivitibus responsa dabit Phryx augur et Indus\nConductus; dabit astrorum mundique peritus.\u2014Sat. 6. v. 582.\n```\n\nThe Minstrel, Jungleur, Jogeleur, Juggler of France and of England exercised the same arts, and may possibly have the same eastern origin, although the era is too distant to trace any more immediate connection than the following:\n\nMerry is it in hall, to hear the harpe,\nThe mynstrelles synge, the jogleurs carp.\u2014Adam Davie, A.D. 1312.\n\nA lousy jogleuer can deceive the,\nAnd parde, yet can I more craft than he.\u2014Chaucer, Friar\u2019s Tales.\nThey have no fixed habitations; speak a dialect peculiar to themselves; are notorious for kidnapping and pilfering, and have a chief or king to each troop. The Luri keep bears and monkeys, which they teach to perform grotesque tricks; profess divination and fortune-telling, that is, the sciences of 'Ramal' and 'Karau,' which obtain them a ready admission into every society; but their most favourite pastimes are dancing, music, and drinking. They dress preposterously with feathers, skins, berries, shells, and baubles; are immodest, addicted to sensuality, and are said never to marry. The religion this tribe professes is Mahometanism; but they appear indifferent to it, and, according to convenience, conform to the opinions of any other sect. So far Lieutenant Pottinger, who travelled through the southern part of Persia for the purpose of gaining information, as to the political state of the country.*\n\nHasan, an intelligent native of Mekran in Belochistan, whom I met in my journey from Bombay through the province of Malwah, described the Luri, or Gypsey, of his country, in nearly the same terms as Lieutenant Pottinger does; but with this addition, that they are Loh\u0101r or Loh\u0101ri by profession, that is, iron-smiths or tinkers; and adds, that they derive the name of Luri by contraction from Loh\u0101r. According to his account, they are a roaming tribe who reside in temporary sheds, or under a small sheet or tent, are notorious for their bad habits, and live chiefly by smithery and music.\n\nThis account of the Luri of Belochistan approaches so near to the Luli of Ir\u0101k-Ajami, and Curdistan, that they may, without fear of mistake, be classed together as part of the same original tribe; but, whether they entered Persia at the same time, or in union with the northern Kauli from K\u0101bul, or separately, and at a different age, we require other data to enable us to determine. In the eastern province of Chorasan the Gypseys are said to be very numerous, and bear the name of Karashm\u0101r.\n\nIn regard to language, all I could learn was, that the Luli or Luri, the Kauli, and Kar\u0101chi, names by which, in different provinces of this extensive country, the Gypsey tribe is known, possess a distinct dialect or speech, that is unintelligible to the natives of Persia; and that the words thus used by them, as for instance, P\u012bta, drink\u2014Pani, water\u2014Tum, you, &c. resemble in a very striking manner the common Hindi language.\n\n* Vide Travels in Belochist\u0101n, by Lieutenant Pottinger, A.D. 1809. Sir John Malcolm, in a note to the second volume of his History of Persia, observes, \"Small encampments of Gypseys are frequently met with in Persia; the habits and occupations of the families which we saw in that country appeared very similar to those of the vagrant tribes who wander over England.\" Vide p. 596.\nThe following detailed account is given by Firdausi, in his Sh\u0101h-N\u0101mah, of the introduction, fourteen hundred years ago, of the Luri into Ir\u0101n, from India, in consequence of a request to Shankal, the Raja of that country, and the father-in-law of Bahr\u0101m.\n\nThe following detailed account is given by Firdausi, in his Sh\u0101h-N\u0101mah, of the introduction, fourteen hundred years ago, of the Luri into Ir\u0101n, from India, in consequence of a request to Shankal, the Raja of that country, and the father-in-law of Bahr\u0101m.\n\"Reason of Bahr\u0101m's bringing the Luri from India.\n\n\"The king addressed letters to the priests of each province inquiring who was distressed, and where the poor were afflicted; demanding of them every information relative to the state of his empire, that the same might be communicated to the royal heart. Each mobed, noble, and sage replied, that the face of the country was populous, and on every side thanksgivings were heard: the indigent alone complaining to his majesty of the hardness of the times; that the opulent drank wine, and ornamented their heads with chaplets of flowers, quaffing liquor to the sound of music, without reflecting on their poorer fellow creatures. The king smiled at the complaint; and, to remedy the privation complained of, dispatched an envoy, with the following message, to Shankal, King of Canauj. 'O prince, attentive to justice; the indigent classes here drink wine without music, a circumstance of which the wealthier cannot approve. Therefore, of those Luri [of India], chuse for and send to me ten thousand male and female who play upon the lute.' The Luri were accordingly sent to the Persian king, who assigned them an appropriate residence, and gave to each individual a cow and an ass; he desired them to nominate a village chief, and bestowed also a thousand load of wheat on such as were most deserving; to the end that, labouring with their kine and asses, they might reap, in due season, the seed of their wheat, and thus enable his poor subjects to have their music gratuitously performed.\n\n\"The Luri departed; and heedlessly consuming all their wheat as well as their cows, toward the end of the year were left shamelessly destitute. The king rebuked them for their lavish conduct in wasting the corn, and neglecting to harvest any crop: and then dismissed them, with an order that, taking their asses, they should load them with their chattels, and support themselves by means of their songs, and the strumming of their silken bows: and that each year they should travel over the country, and sing for the amusement of the high and the low.\n\n\"The Luri, agreeably to this mandate, now* wander about the world, seeking employment, associating with dogs and wolves, and thieving on the road by day and by night.\"\n\n*A.D. 420 is the age of Bahr\u0101m-G\u016br, and A.D. 1000 that of Firdausi; an interesting fact as it regards the introduction of the Gypseys into Persia. Vide Shah-Namah of Firdausi.\nAccording to Sir W. Ouseley, the tribe Karachi in Persia resemble our Gypseys in the use of a particular dialect, and in their fondness for an erratic life; their preference of tents to houses; telling fortunes by inspecting the palm of the hand; in their pilfering habits; and in being nearly without religion, although they make occasionally an outward profession of it.\n\nThe following list of Persic-Gypsey words shews their correspondence with those of India and England.

B\u0101zigar, or juggler, and Panchpiri are the common names by which this class of wanderers is designated by Mahometans.\n\nThe Nat', or Beri\u0101, assimilate closely in the following circumstances to their more distant and exiled brethren, the Kauli of Persia, the Ching\u0101na of Syria, and Zigeuner and Zingari of Germany, Italy, and generally of Europe.\n\n1. The Nat' tribe have no regular house or habitation, but live in small and low matted sheds, which they remove and carry about on a little bullock or ass, and roam at pleasure from one part of the country to another.\n\n2. They are commonly esteemed rogues: that is, Nat'-k'hat; the latter being a familiar popular term to signify any one sly, underhand, or roguish.*\n\n3. In Bengal, Behar, Benares, Oude, and Malwah, they live in groupes of from five to ten or fifteen families; some of them profess Mahometanism, although but slightly, since they can hardly repeat their short creed; others, by citing the Biz'hal, or scripture of the reformed Kabir, would seem to be Kabir Panthis, a sect of dissenting Hind\u016bs, whose tenets are Deistical, and free from every species of idolatry.\n\n4. They catch snakes, and are excellent jugglers and tumblers; make baskets, ropes, and mats; practise singing, music, palmistry, and, assuming occasionally the habit of religious mendicants, collect alms.\n\n5. They inter their dead, contrary to the common custom of Hind\u016bs.\n\n6. They elect a chief.\n\n7. They have trial by jury, or Panch\u0101yat; having both great and small meetings for the purpose of deciding any quarrel.\n\nThey are reported by Mr. Harris, an enterprising traveller of my acquaintance, to be numerous in Kashmir; and it appears that they are not unknown in Kabul and the Sik'h provinces of the Panjab.\n\nOn submitting my brief vocabulary of the Gypsey to the inspection of the Honourable Mountstuart Elphinstone, late Governor of Bombay, I was favoured with the following note; and, as the observation it contains throws\n\n* For several characteristic traits regarding the Nat' of Hindustan, vide Capt. Richardson's Essay in the Asiatic Researches. Vol. vii.\nadditional light on this subject, coming from a quarter of the world which he visited under peculiarly favourable circumstances, I trust I shall have his pardon for its insertion:\u2014\"You are, I believe, the first who has traced them home to India through Persia and Kabul: in the latter country they are now unknown. There are many words in the vocabulary not Hindustani; but being Asiatic, a comparison of them with the other languages of India, and even with the Zend and Pehlevi, might throw further light on the age in which the Gypsey emigration took place.\"\n\nFor the following detail of the Deccan Gypsey, I am indebted to the Abb\u00e9 Dubois:\u2014Kuraver, Kuru-meru, Lambadi, Sukater,\u2014these appear to be the usual terms by which the Gypsies of southern India are known: they live under little tents constructed of woven bamboos, about three feet high by five or six feet in length and breadth.\n\nKanoji is another class of Gypsies, who are said to be equally formidable as their brethren. Those again called Dumbaru, are jugglers and mountebanks; they keep tame serpents, and are initiated in occult and necromantic arts. Another race exhibit comedies, farces, and puppet-shows.\n\nThe Paka-Nati are a set of wanderers who sojourn in the open fields as the others do, and employ themselves in hunting, fishing, and begging; the heads of this tribe or family decide disputes and hold Panchayats, or juries: but the palm of ingenuity and dexterity must be conceded to the Kalla-bantru, who are, or at least were, such complete robbers, thieves, and sharpers, and were so well trained, that the Mysorean prince Tippoo had a regular battalion of them on service with his army in time of war; not for the purpose of fighting, but, far otherwise, to infest the enemy's camp at night, to steal away horses and other necessaries of the officers, to spike cannon, and to act as spies, in a manner similar, in some degree, to what has been reported of the Turkish and Hungarian Gypsey.\n\nFrom the same writer, I am led to suppose that the Indian Gypsey may be the bastard offspring, not only of the Chatriya, but of all those who were driven out from the other tribes; and finding themselves a class separated from and despised by every other, they lost all respect for themselves. In the Deccan, their use of carrion may be derived from necessity; to kill a cow being a crime which the Hindu law punished with death.\n\nThe tribe called Nat', or dancers, is numerous in Bengal, Behar, Bundelkand, Malwah, and Guzerat; they are commonly known by three names, viz.\n\n1. Nat', a rogue; one who leads a wandering life.\n2. Beri\u0101, a dancer or tumbler; and\nBerin, a female dancer or songstress.\n\n3. B\u0101zi-gar, a player or juggler.\n\nThe two first are Hindi names expressive of their characters; the third is a Mahomedan, or Urdu appellation, of the same tribe, from the Persian words B\u0101zi \u067e\u0627\u0632\u06cc play, and Gar \u06af\u0631 an affix implying an agent.\n\nThe Nat' are skilled in gymnastic exercises, such as wrestling and single-stick; the use of the L\u0113zam* and Mugdar;\u2020 and in performing the Dand, or gymnastic prostrations; beside music, dancing, treading a rope, tumbling in all its varieties, playing with balls, swallowing a sword, and a great variety of other feats. The Berin, or female Gypseys, have a dance peculiar to themselves; it may be danced by a great number, and in former times is said to have been got up with extraordinary expense.\n\nThe following introductory stanza to a war song, called Kark\u0101, of Raja Jai Sing of Canauj, mentions these dances as being exhibited at an entertainment in the king's palace; and then goes on to detail a severe battle fought between the Hindu and Mahomedan forces, some 700 years ago.\n\nN\u00e4chen Berin, jab Banglin men,\nLarke bole kal\u0101vat k\u0101;\nCham cham, cham cham, p\u0101el bole\nAor gar'h lage seringi k\u016b.\n\nTable tan bige s\u0101rk\u0101\nPare ghalichi makhmal v\u0101li,\nBanglen bare bare sird\u0101r.\n\nTirche bao batae;\nB'hanan b'hanan sitar;\nBangla hoven chalisva r\u0101g;\nK'hamba lage, sang marmark\u0101:\n\n[hall,\nWhen the female Gypseys danced in the\nThe young musicians struck up,\nThe guitars sounded,\nBy the tuneful tabor:\nWhich, spread over with velvet carpets,\nWas filled with noble chiefs.\n\nExhibiting sly glances;\nThe ankle-bells jingled,\nAnd violins, accompanied [the palace,\nThen the 36 R\u0101gs\u2021\u2021 resounded through\nAdorned with marble pillars,\n\n* A kind of bow with an iron chain, instead of a string, with which the natives exercise their bodies.\u2014Hunter.\n\u2020 A large mallet employed by the native soldiers as we do dumb-bells.

Generally speaking, they appear to be more industrious here than in other countries; but still, as the late Colonel Richardson expresses it, they are esteemed, as elsewhere, \"rogues, not downright, but imaginary; being at least reputed thieves.\"\n\nHaving thus traced the Gypsey through Europe and Asia to his native place, and shewed the general resemblance of this tribe in feature and in language, I may briefly advert to what occurred the day before I left my late residence in Hampshire. Old Master Sam. Ayres is considered as the head or chief of those bearing his name, or that of Stanley: he was born in the year 1745, and had served several years in the army. On one occasion I saved his life by a little surgical aid, and he acknowledged the service I had done him gratefully. A number of his family came to pay their humble respects at Court House, and to wish me a prosperous journey: this was done in a plain but earnest manner; and seated on the steps before my door, eating some slices of fresh barley bread which I gave them, with water to drink, it was impossible not to be pleased with their songs and artless mirth, their cheerful merry countenances. The children danced and sang; but as soon as they had finished their homely meal, they came and said in a very pretty manner, \"Thank God, and thank you, sir!\"\u2014a grace that I little expected, and which, if studied ever so much, could scarcely be altered for the better.\n\nThe following remarks I owe to Mr. Horace Hayman Wilson, of Calcutta, and I cite them to mark this eminent Oriental scholar's opinion of the origin of this race:\u2014\"The affinity of the Gypsey to the Hindustani language was first pointed out by Grellman, in his 'Historischer Versuch uber die Zigeuner.' His French translator, the Baron de Bach, in 1787, added considerably to the vocabulary. The Petersburg vocabulary contained specimens of the same. Bartolomeo exhibited the Sanscrit origin of many of Grellman's examples; but the Monthly Register of Berlin, for February and April 1793, contained the most extensive collection of this nature. Some of the most intelligent views of their origin and language are to be found in Bright's Travels in Hungary, where the Zigeuner appear to be numerous, and enjoy something like political existence, being assembled in towns, under peculiar\nColonel Harriot on the Oriental Origin of the Gypseys.\n\nregulations. Of the seventy-four words in Sir William Ouseley's list, at least fifty-one are pure Sanscrit; the rest are mostly Persian. In like manner, the language of the Zigeuner which is not Hindi is German\u2014that of the Gitano, Spanish\u2014and that of the Gypseys, English; in most instances corrupted into slang or cant, but referable to the spoken dialect of the country in which the people happen to reside: a local variation which was to have been expected, and leaving, in the uniformity of the base of their dialect, sufficient evidence of their Indian origin.\"\n\nAdelung of Germany, Mr. Marsden, Colonel Richardson, Lieutenants Vincent and Pottinger, are the other writers who have thrown light on the history of this singular people; and it is only by the collection of data and by the comparison of their respective vocabularies, by which we can expect to trace their affiliation and general history.\n\nTo explain briefly the similarity of the Gypsey or Romanes language in England, Hungary, Spain, and Hindustan, I shall put down a few corresponding words of each country, as selected from Mr. Bright for the Hungarian and Spanish, and from my own vocabulary for the English.\n| English | English Zingari | Hungarian Zingari | Spanish Zingari | Hindi |\n|---------|----------------|------------------|----------------|------|\n| Cow     | Guvni; Guvani. | Gurinum.         | Guru.          |      |\n| Ox      | Gouro.         | Gouro.           | G\u00e1e; Gau; Guru.|      |\n| Soul (life) | Zi (life).    | Ochi.            | Ji.            |      |\n| Knife   | Churi.         | Chori.           | Chori.         |      |\n| Drunk   | Matto; M\u0101to.   | Matto-chino.     | Mat; mat-vala. |      |\n| Salt    | Lon.           | Lohn.            | Lon.           |      |\n| Mouth   | Mui.           | Mui.             | Munh.          |      |\n| Flesh (meat) | M\u0101s.        | Mas.             | Mans.          |      |\n| God     | Midevol; Midaval. | Dievla.       | Dever; Oteber. |      |\n| Father  | Dade, Dad.     | Dade.            | Deva.          |      |\n| Man     | Mush.          | Manush.          | Dada, grandfather. |      |\n| Water   | Pani.          | Pani.            | Pani.          |      |\n| Fire    | Jag.           | Jeg.             | Ag.            |      |\n| Rain    | Brischin.      | Brischin.        | B\u0101rish.        |      |\n| Silver  | Rup.           | Rup.             | Rupa.          |      |\n| Wheat   | Giv.           | Give.            | Gihun.         |      |\n| Feather | Pori.          | Por.             | Par.           |      |\n| Old     | Puru.          | Puri.            | Bur'a; Purana. |      |\n| \u2014 man.  | Puru mush.     | Puri; Puro.      | Purania.       |      |\n| One     | Yek.           | Jeg.             | Ek.            |      |\n| Two     | Due.           | Dui.             | Do.            |      |\n| Three   | Trin.          | Tri.             | Tin; Tri.      |      |\n| Four    | St\u0101r.          | Stah.            | Char.          |      |\n| Five    | Panj.          | Paunch.          | Panch.         |      |\n| Six     | Shov.          | Schef.           | Chah.          |      |\n\nBeyond these numbers I could never proceed with any success.\nExtract of a Letter from Capt. J. T. Ellis, at Baroda, in Guzerat.\n\n\"Kol\u0101ti, Kanjari, Nat'.\u2014At Baroda these people are stated to be of very different castes, though their habits in some degree assimilate. The Kol\u0101ti come from Nagpur, and eat carrion; the Kanjara and Nat' come from Visiapur, near Wagur: the former eat meat, but not carrion; the latter eat no meat. At present at Baroda there are no Kanjaras or Nat's and only (as reckoned by the natives) an inferior kind of Kol\u0101ti, who tumble on the ground, but do not dance on ropes, &c.\n\n\"None of these three castes know the original country of their ancestors; all three dance, tumble on ropes; and the Kol\u0101ti and Kanjara make toys with Kadjans for children, bamboo sieves, mats, &c.\n\n\"A few of the Kanjara are fortune-tellers and astrologers, and all of the three castes are supposed to understand, or rather to be imbued with, jadoo or witchcraft, the maila-ilam, without which it is supposed, indeed, they cannot perform their feats of activity. The Nat' are famous for exhibiting the deceptive growth of mango trees, &c.\n\n\"The three great castes sometimes act as W\u0101gr\u012bs, or are beggars, or follow any other vagrant course of life. The Kol\u0101tis and Kanjaras never engage in cultivation, but the Nat', when the summer excursion has been unproductive, halt near a village or town, hire a spot of ground for the monsoon, or till they can derive a crop from it; after which they give up the ground, and recommence their erratic life. It is only, however, when labouring under great distress that they thus become temporary cultivators.\n\n\"Every detachment of each caste has a head-man, or chief; and they settle their disputes by Panch\u0101yat.\n\n\"It is said, at Baroda, that all three castes bury their dead. The Kol\u0101ti convey their baggage on asses; the Kanjara, on buffaloes; but the Nat' in Guzerat move with carts.\"\n**Comparative Vocabulary of the Gypsy Dialect, with a variety of Asiatic Synonymes, deduced chiefly from the Hindi, or Language of Hindustan.**\n\n| English       | Gypsy   | Hindi, or Hindustani | Persian, or Sanscrit |\n|---------------|---------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| All           | Sa.     | S\u0101r\u0101, \u0633\u0627\u0631\u0627            | Sarva \u0633\u0631\u0641\u0627 s.         |\n| Ask           | Puch.   | Puchn\u0101, \u067e\u0648\u0686\u0646\u0627        | Prach \u067e\u0631\u0627\u0686           |\n| \u2014 Go and ask. | J\u0101 puch las. | Puch, \u067e\u0648\u0686, imperat. | B\u0101ta \u0628\u0627\u062a\u0627 s., B\u0101d \u0628\u0627\u062f p. |\n| Air           | Baval.  | B\u0101u, \u0628\u0627\u0648, Bai, \u0628\u0627\u06cc    | Upari \u0627\u067e\u0631\u06cc s.         |\n| Above         | Pre, apre. | Upar, \u0627\u0648\u067e\u0631           |                      |\n| Aunt          | Bibi.   | P'upi, \u067e\u0648\u067e\u06cc          |                      |\n| Acquaintance  | Jin.    | Chin, \u062c\u0646, J\u00e4nna, \u062c\u0627\u0646 |                      |\n| Ass           | Maila.  |                      |                      |\n| Angry         | Honi, Hono. |                      |                      |\n| Alehouse      | Kichema. |                      |                      |\n| Art thou a maid. | Tute tano juvu. | Jovan; Joban, a maid. |                      |\n| Apple         | P\u0101bo.   |                      |                      |\n| Afraid, v.

Observations on a Gold Ring of Hindu Fabrication found at Montrose in Scotland. By Lieut.-Colonel James Tod, M.R.A.S., &c. &c.\n\nRead May 15, 1830.\n\nThe ring, of which a fac-simile is annexed, was sent to me by a valued associate of our Society with the following letter:\n\n\"Upper Lodge, Bushey Park, 20th March 1829.\n\n\"My dear Sir: You will at once appreciate the following curious circumstances connected with the ring that accompanies this letter.\n\n\"It was dug up on the Fort Hill near Montrose, some years since, on the site of an engagement occasioned by the landing of the English during Mary's minority and her absence in France.\n\n\"The late Miss Erskine, of Dun, purchased it, as it was supposed to bear the supporters of the arms (two griffins) of that family.\n\n\"It has since been duly considered as a family relic until shewn to me by the Countess of Cassilis, though her ladyship had ever, herself, been sceptical on its supposed relation to her ancestors.\n\n\"It required but a slight knowledge of Hindu mythology at once to\n\"claim for it an eastern origin; and I have begged her Ladyship's permission to send it to you, hoping you will offer to the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland such observations on the discovery of so extraordinary a relic in so unlooked-for a quarter, as your extensive information respecting the history and antiquities of India may suggest.\n\n\"My dear Sir,\n\n\"Most truly your's,\n(Signed) \"G. Fitzclarence.\"\n\n\"To Lieut.-Colonel Tod, Birdhurst, Croydon.\"\n\nAs Colonel Fitzclarence justly remarks, \"it requires but a slight knowledge of Hindu mythology at once to claim for this ring an eastern origin,\" though it will not be so easy to assign a satisfactory solution of its discovery \"in so unlooked-for a quarter.\" Were it stamped with less unquestionable characteristics of Hindu art, we might argue on the possibility of its being a Celtic relic; but participating somewhat in the scepticism of the noble proprietor of the ring, we shall \"avisez la fin,\"* before we commit ourselves to the suggestion that it may have appertained to some Celtic adorer of Isis, or one of those \"giant Getes\" from Scania, who in ancient times found sepulture in their descents on the Scots. But let us describe what it actually is, ere we speculate further on its origin.\n\nThis mystic amulet has at once an astrological and mythological import. It represents the symbol of the sun-god Balnat'h, around which is wreathed a serpent guardant, with two bulls as supporters: or the powers of creative nature in unison, typified in the miniature Lingam and Yoni\u2014in short, a graven image of that primeval worship which prevailed among the nations of antiquity. This is \"the pillar and the calf worshipped on the 15th of the month\" (the sacred Amavus of the Hindus) by the Israelites, when they adopted the rites of the Syro-Phoenician adorers of Bal, the sun. This, the pillar of Belenus (whose rites were introduced by those early navigators into Gaul and Britain), to whom were raised those rude unchiselled columns scattered over Europe wherever the Celtic name was known.\n\nIn Hindu mythology the bull, Nanda, is at once the guardian of one of the two\u2020 gates of the heaven of Isvara\u2021 or Bal-Siva, and his steed. The\n\n* The motto of the Cassilis family. \u2020 The equinoctial signs. \u2021 Nanda, the bull of the Hindu Iswara, is the Mnevis or Apis of Osiris. The mysteries of the Lingam and Phallus are evidently the same.\nColonel Tod's Observations on a Gold Ring found at Montrose.\n\nastronomic allusion thus blended with mythology is evident, i.e. the entrance of the sun into the sign Taurus, the equinoctial festival of remote antiquity, and regarded as a jubilee by the Indo-Scythic nations hemming the shores of the Mediterranean to the Indian ocean.*\n\nThis relic, therefore, must have belonged to some pious devotee, who, desirous never to lose sight of the object of his adoration, wore it as a talisman on the thumb. The uncommon appendage on the shoulders which induced the noble possessor to imagine the bulls to be the winged vipers supporting the arms of Mar, is the hump which characterizes the kine within the Indus. I possess medals of Indo-Scythic princes with both Greek and Parthian legends, having the same humped bull on the obverse side, which not only demonstrates the extent of the Indo-Scythic empire,\u2020 but affords evidence of a combination of the Mithraic worship of the Transoxianic nations with that of the Tauriform representative of the Hindu solar divinity.\n\nWhile, however, I suggest these reasons for the Hindu origin of the ring, I would by no means preclude others from entertaining the idea that it may be Celtic, Phoenician, or Gotic. The objections which occur at a first glance of the relic may be diminished by recalling the uniformity of worship which distinguished the races who, from some central region of early civilization, perhaps Sacadwipa, Sacatai, or Scythia (of which Balk might have been the metropolis), whence India and Egypt, Syria and Greece, were enlightened, still preserved, wherever they migrated, the remembrance of an ancient festival; on which, whether of Surya on the Ganges; of Thor (or Sor) in Scandinavia; of Beli, or Belenus, amongst the Celts; or of Mithras amongst the Persians, the bull was the victim to the solar divinity.\n\nSome may suppose this relic to have been carried west in some early migration; for none will dispute the ability of the children of Tubal Cain to fabricate such ornaments when Europe was in barbarism. Even the beaded edges and other characteristics of the Hindu Cellini might be attributed to the unalterable laws which govern the oriental crafts even in the model of a ring.\n\nThe symbols of the creative power, which are wreathed around the por-\n\n* See description of the festival of Gouri, or Isis, on the vernal equinox in Rajpootana.\u2014Annals of Rajasthan, vol. i. p. 573.\n\u2020 See Trans. R. A. S., vol. i. p. 313. Also \"Observations on that paper of the author, on Bactrian and Parthian Medals, by the celebrated M. de Schlegel, Journal Asiatique.\"\ntal of the minor temple of Isis at Pompeii, are precisely those before the reader; and in the terra cotta Penates of the same divinity, four thousand of which were excavated from the precincts of her fane at Paestum, the goddess holds in her right hand this same symbol, emblematic perhaps of that grand catastrophe, the flood, alluded to in the Egyptian fable of Isis and Osiris; and the preservation of the species from Typhon, the destructive power, typified in the serpent. When I detected these symbols at Cortona, at Pompeii, and Paestum, those ancient cities founded by the first colonists of Italy, I was gratified in finding the mythological chain which connected the Isis of the Ganges and the Nile extended to the Tiber and the Arno. It was by the Celto-Etruscan tribes that the worship of Isis was introduced, long before the \"eternal city\" existed: the Romans had no occasion to import her rites from Egypt. Her name is the same, and bears the same signification in Celtic as in Greek; and Suetonius, the historian, incidentally lets us know that the imperial epithet Cesar, deprived of its initial letter, means dominus in the old Tuscan. Thus the Esar and Es-\u00e9s of the Etrusci are the Eswara and Esa of the Hindus. But there are many proofs besides this isolated example of the Indo-Scythic origin of the ancient Etrusci: they had the division of castes,* viz.\n\n1st. The Larthes, or Tyrani, or lords.\n2d. The Tusci, or priesthood.\n3d. The Rasen\u00e6,+ or warriors.\n4th. The Mass, or \"caste populaire.\"\n\nThe Etruscans had also this remarkable feature: their sacred books, like those of the Hindus, laid down architectural rules for their cities and edifices;\u2020 those vast monuments so analogous to the most antique fortresses of India, which evince both races to have been far advanced in the mechanical arts. The sculpture in the Tuscan cities has a decidedly Oriental character.\u00a7 Some of the most celebrated names both of ancient and modern days maintain the Indo-Scythic origin of this branch of the Pelasgii, and locate their cradle between the Euxine and Caspian;|| but I presume to surmise that this was but an intermediate place of halt from a more eastern abode, that of Transoxiana, the land of the Turshk\u00e1 invaders of India,\n\n* Malte-Brun, Pr\u00e9cis de G\u00e9ographie, tom. vi. p. 106.\n\u2020 The third caste, or warriors, is good Sanscrit: S\u00e9na, the army\u2014of the state, Raj.\n\u2021 Micali, \"l'Italie avant la domination des Romains,\" Ed. R. Rochette, tom. i, ch. x.\n\u00a7 See Plates to Micali.\n|| Micali, tom. i, p. 85, Volney.\nwhich clearly approximates to Turscum, the ancient Toscan. Can this possibly be a colony of the Indo-Scythic Turshka, or Takshac from Sakatai, to which allusion is often made in the earliest traditions of India, and always figuratively as the serpent race, a branch of which, the Nagavansi chieftains of Ramgurh Sirgooja, have the lunettes of their serpent ancestor engraved on their signets in proof of their lineage? The Ophite worship, conjoined with that of Isis, may thus have been introduced into India and Italy by colonies of the same race, and certainly the characters of the Osci or Opici (the serpent race of Italy), adopted by the Etruscans, have a great analogy to the rock-inscriptions of the Scythic Sauras, or sun-worshippers of Saurashtra.\n\nIn the ring before us we see this reptile guarding the emblems of fruition; and in the palace of Portici (where are deposited the discoveries of Pompeii) there is the mosaic pavement of the temple, which represents the same symbol of Isis guarded by two serpent supporters. The serpent is also placed over the portal of a garden at Pompeii, significant of the same mystery. It is curious that the Osci or Opici, who not only held all Campania sacred to Isis, and its adjoining provinces, but spread their branches throughout Italy, has been by some derived from \"Serpentes;\" and though it is not said the Tursci or Etrusci is one of its branches, yet they were evidently of one stock. The adoption of the serpent-guardian of the emblem of Isis at Pompeii would thus receive explanation, and strengthen the existence of a common origin of the Indo-Scythic Turshka of Central Asia and India, and the Tursci and Osci of Italy; but here we are in darkness; let us leave Italy for Gaul.\n\nThe Celtic tribes of Gaul and Britain were as ardent votaries of Isis as those of Italy; nor were the Getic or Gothic tribes of the north less\n\n---\n\n* Takshac, Serpa, N\u00e1ga, are all used synonymously for serpent. It is a singular fact, that in every country the serpent is the medium of communicating knowledge. These Takshacs, Nagas, or serpents, introduced letters into India. Such the interpretation of the eagle, symbolic of the Vishnuvi's seizing the celebrated work Ping\u00e1l from the snake, as of Crishna's own exploit in recovering the secrets or Vedas from the deep, where they were conveyed by the serpent. These wise serpents are the Takshacs of Higher Asia. All these races were named after animals and reptiles, as the Aswas or horses, a celebrated Indo-Scythic race: the Sussoos, or hares; the Cuchwas, or tortoises.

Isis had not, even at this advanced period of Christianity, lost all her influence, and we might have compared her effigy with Isani, but for the piety of the Bishop's secretary: \"Frere Jehan, sur- nomm\u00e9 le sage, assurant qu'il avoit trouv\u00e9 une femme a genoux devant cette idole, tenant une touffe de chandelles allum\u00e9es, et deplorant quelque perte qu'il lui \u00e9tait advenue, et interrog\u00e9e qu'elle faisait l\u00e0, repondit que, des \u00e9coliers au Pr\u00e9 aux clercs lui avaient donn\u00e9 ce conceil et dict : 'Allez \u00e0 l'idole St. Germain et vous trouverez ce qu'avez perdu.' En la place de la site, le dit sieur Briconnet y fist sceller une grande croix que l'on y void encore.\"\u00a7\n\nThe personal description of the goddess from two ancient authorities, is the perfect counterpart of the consort of the Hindu sun-god, *Bal Nath,* or Siva: \"Elle \u00e9tait comme d'une grande femme h\u00e2ve, maigre et d\u00e9chevel\u00e9e; noire et nue:\"|| the exact representation of the consort goddess of Isvara, on the exterior of his temples, where their symbols, the Lingam and Yoni, as represented on the ring, are worshipped in the sanctum. Precisely the *Kali Devi,* or black goddess, whose common appellation of *Suk\u00e1 M\u00e1t\u00e1,* the dry mother, may either express that she has given all her nourishment to her children, or that she is the parent at once of life and death.\n\nIt is an erroneous, though generally-received opinion, that the Celtic races had no sculptured deities or temples previous to their becoming tribu-\n\n---\n\n* Histoire de l'Isle de France.\n\n\u2020 La ville de Paris, autrefois d\u00e9di\u00e9e \u00e0 Isis, et situ\u00e9e pr\u00e8s de la ville d'Isia (Melun) eut de temps imm\u00e9morial un navire pour symbole et pour armes.

On the site of her temple, \"dont les deux gables subsistent encore,\" is erected the church of the Sainte Trinit\u00e9, of which these gables form the \"croisillon,\" or transept. They are described to have been pierced for celestial observation: \"Dans le gable qui regarde le midi, on pratiqua deux fen\u00eatres, l'une de solstice d'hiver, \u00e0 la hauteur d'environ dix pieds de l'arie, et l'autre du solstice d'\u00e9t\u00e9, au-dessus de la galerie des \u00e9quinoxes.\"\u2020 Here we see the chief celestial revolutions were the objects of devotion with the Celts of Gaul; to one of which the ring before us has allusion. The statue of the goddess was placed in a central position of this sacred observatory: \"En face de la double fen\u00eatre du milieu, ils plac\u00e8rent une statue d'Isis, sous la forme d'une femme, qui avait sur la t\u00eate un croissant, et qui tenait avec affection sur les genoux des enfants qui lui tendoient les bras.\" Here in the Celtic Isis of Falaise, we have a more pleasing form of the universal mother, the Isani of the Hindus, than that of the Parisii. This is the Mata Janoni, or mother of births; and though I have never seen her head so ornamented with the crescent, yet that of the One, Creator of all, has a cross on the very apex of its pyramidal roof, at the sacred lake of Poshkur.\n\nBut supposing it might be disputed that the statues had been formed after intercourse with the Romans, we have still stronger proof in the worship of the identical symbols, such as I detected at Paestum and Pompeii, and such as are on the ring before us, in various parts of France.\n\nA very interesting work has been written chiefly in the Celtic monuments at Toull,\u2021 the Tullum of the Romans, and the capital of the Luci, a tribe renowned as archers, who appear to have worshipped Isis under the same symbols as those on the ring before us. Like the martial Rajpoot, the Luci had these emblems of life placed beside their sepulchres. The author specifies thirty-five monuments yet existing, \"qui ont la forme d'un c\u00f4ne\n\n---\n\n* Recherches sur les Ruines et les Monumens de la ville Celtique de Toull.\n\u2020 Dissertation sur Belenus, prefixed to \"Recherches sur Falaise,\" p. 19.\n\u2021 I have to regret my ignorance of these remains when I passed through Toull a few months ago, and stopped some time to examine its superb Gothic cathedral.\n\"tronqu\u00e9, et pour socle une bordure en forme de coquille;\" but this socle,* or plinth to the symbol of Belenus, is described as having a small basin attached with a rigode or channel for the lustrations to flow off, doubtless the yoni of Hindu adoration. A rude statue of the goddess seated on an altar, in form an Isocoles triangle, the especial sign of the followers of Iswara,\u2020 yields full proof of the identity of this religion.\u00a7 I shall rest satisfied with one more quotation: \"Si l'on examine avec attention les signes, tant sous forme de disque, que sous celui de c\u00f4ne tronqu\u00e9, ou de tron\u00e7on de colonne, on demeure bient\u00f4t convaincu qu'ils \u00e9taient, pour nos anc\u00eatres, une symbole de religion;\" and he justly concludes, \"je suis certain que ce syst\u00e8me religieux a pris naissance en Asie.\"\u2021 Contrary to the declamation of many authorities against the Celts, who are denied even capability of improvement,\u00a7 Monsieur Barailon rates their attainments highly, and quotes Diodorus Siculus to prove that \"they worked skilfully in gold, silver, brass, and iron; that they formed the first of these metals into collars and rings, the second into casques and cuirasses, and with the third ornamented their sword-belts; that they had reached great perfection in the art of dyeing, and the fabrication of stuffs,\" and quotes Dion Chrystosome on the magnificence of their kings; Polybius and Florus on the beauty of their war-chariots, which were painted and gilded; and moreover states, that they coined the precious metals,|| which coins are still discovered in their old cities, and many of which exist in the \"Cabinet des M\u00e9dailles\" at Paris.\n\nThus we see that this peculiar symbolic worship of Isis amongst the Celto-Etruscan colonists of Italy, and the Celtic tribe of Gaul, is perfectly analogous with the Egyptian (as recorded by Herodotus), with the Israelitic of old, and the Hindu of this present day; and the boat or Ark, also symbolic of this divinity, alike characterized her rites amongst the Celts and\n\n* \"55.

The finest piece of allegorical Hindu sculpture which I ever discovered had reference to this catastrophe. It represented Narayana, or the Spirit floating on the chaotic waters, with Lachshmi, Isani, or Isis, at his feet, reposing on a marine couch placed on the back of the sea-serpent, or hydra, whose many heads formed a canopy over the deity. The couch was supported by the monsters of the deep, amongst them Nereides blowing the Sankha, or conch-shell, and Varaha (the boar) rescuing triumphantly on his tusk these symbols of regeneration from the alluvion of universal destruction.\u2021\n\nThe Getic race which peopled the shores of the Baltic, was a colony of the Thussa-Get\u00e6, driven from their seats between the Caspian and Euxine by Darius Hystaspes,\u00a7 six centuries before Christ.

They were divided into the white and black Asiatics or Asi, the Getes being particularly fair, \"mais les autres sont plus fonc\u00e9s, plus jaunes que le goudron.\"\u2020 The abode of the first was Asi-gard (region of the Asi, of the other Midgard,\u2021 or central region.\n\nThe goddess *Klimba* of these northern tribes has all the characteristics as well as the name of the *Kali-ambu*, or Black Mother, of the Hindus, and, like her, has her abode on the mountain top, where her votaries repaired to consult their destiny.

She was also called Laima, *Fortune* or *Fate*; and \"fragments of ancient hymns are still sung by the peasants at their popular festivals (in Livonia), in which the beneficent goddess is celebrated under the endearing name of *Laima Mahmina*, or Mother Goodluck.\"\u00a7 Here we have not only the name of *Mahama*, \"the Great Mother,\" and *Ella-ma* or Laima, *Mother Earth*, but all her characteristic qualities; and even in the little titmouse, the bird of omen of Klimba or Laima, we have the parallel to the bird of omen of Kali-ma, the black mother of the Hindus.\n\nWhen, therefore, besides the nominal resemblance of the tribes, we find\n\n---\n\n* See Hist. of the Rajpoot Tribes, vol. i.

Rings, more especially seal-rings, seem to have been the first ornament on record, and there appears no nation, however barbarous, unacquainted with them. Scripture constantly alludes to the ring, particularly the \"signet ring,\" the mark of initiation into official dignity in the days of Pharoah and Joseph, as in the present; but that under discussion is a religious ring, worn as a charm against evil.\n\nIn King Haco's memorable expedition, A.D. 1267, against Scotland,\u2020 the tribes of the western isles are peculiarly designated as \"the wearers of rings.\" Thus, in verse 10:\n\n\"The wide-extended Bute was won from the forlorn wearer of rings by the renowned and invincible troops of the promoter of conquest; they wielded the two-edged sword, the foes of our ruler dropt, and the raven from his field of slaughter winged his flight from the Hebrides.\"\n\nNor was this distinctive mark confined to the people of the isles; for the \"Sea-king,\" in his wide sweep, imposing tribute throughout the coasts of Scotland, alike applies the term to the tribe of Cat, Catai, or Catini, the club-men of Cathness.\u00a7\n\n* Caledonia, vol. i. p. 465.\n\u2020 Norwegian Account of Haco's expedition against Scotland, in A.D. 1263, by the Rev.

King Dugal, of the Hebrides, Magnus of Mann, with Byrnulf Johnson, Gudbrand his brother, the cup-bearer, and other celebrated captains, were ordered to impose tribute on the \"wearers of rings\" in Mull and Kintire; another division was commanded \"south to the Frith of Forth;\" but Haco's vassals, like Alexander's, refused obedience, and the scheme was relinquished, or we should have known whether the tribes \"south of the Forth,\" also bore the appellation of the \"ring bearers.\"\u2020\n\nBut although the \"the Exactor of Rings\" did not make a descent amongst the Ottadinini, one of the twenty-one aboriginal tribes of Britain, in whose haunts our relic was found: that they had sustained a signal visitation from the same shores full five centuries anterior to king Haco, we learn from the lay of their prince and bard, the celebrated Aneurin, whose poem deplores in animated strains the defeat of his countrymen by the intruding Saxons in the battle of Cattraith.\u2021\n\n* i.e. his ship.\n\u2020 'Baug-gerder,' i.e. imposer of rings.

To conclude\u2014whatever the history of the Ring, it is a relic of singular curiosity, even had it originated in the plains of the Ganges, which indeed there seems little reason to doubt.\nXXVII. Account of an ancient Arabic Grave-Stone, found at Dhalac-el Kibeer, near Massowah, Abyssinia, deciphered by Graves C. Haughton, Esq., A.M. F.R.S. M.R.A.S., &c.\n\nRead July 3, 1830.\n\nThe grave-stone, of which I propose to give a short account, was laid on the table of this Society a few weeks back by Mr. Samuel D. Broughton, the brother of our respected secretary. It had been left with him by the late Mr. Salt; but, since deciphering it, I have learnt that this and a similar monument were found in the year 1805 by that gentleman when accompanying Lord Valentia, now the Earl of Mount-Norris, at Dhalac-el-Kibeer, near Massowah, on the coast of Abyssinia. The following account of the discovery and bringing away of the stone is given in the second volume of his lordship's travels, pp. 41-42 and 235-236.*\n\n\"On the northern side (of the port of Dhalac-el-Kibeer) are the ruins of two small mosques, built of stone, with round cupolas at top, but of a rude workmanship. In the one towards the sea is an Arabic inscription cut on a stone placed in a recess. Around the mosque a great number of monumental stones are placed upright in the ground, at the heads of the persons whom they commemorate; many are well carved, and beautifully adorned with flowers and other ornaments, some in the Cufic, some in the Arabic character. As the stones are in general of a portable size, Mr. Salt was desirous of taking one away; but, as he was assured by the priest that this could not be done without express permission from the Nayib of Massowah, he contented himself with taking a copy of one inscription which seemed to be held in the highest veneration, although externally it had nothing to recommend it, being indifferently carved and having a corner broken. The priest informed him that it belonged to the Sheik or Sultaun\n\n* Voyages and Travels to India, Ceylon, the Red Sea, Abyssinia, and Egypt, in the years 1802, 3, 4, 5, and 6, by George Viscount Valentia. London, 1809. 3 vols. 4to.\nJanuary 14, 1805.\n\nDhalac el Kibeer.\n\n\"At daylight I (Mr. Salt) went with Abdallah and the two Europeans to the northern mosque, for the purpose of getting possession of some of the monumental stones mentioned in my former account. The best finished inscriptions were engraved on stones too heavy to carry away. I therefore made choice of two of the most perfect, carved in different characters, that were portable, and, wrapping them up very carefully, proceeded back to our lodgings, not quite satisfied, I own, with the propriety of what I was about.\n\n\"Our proceedings having been observed, by the time we reached the house a crowd had assembled, among which were several principal inhabitants. I immediately perceived that they were acquainted with what we had been doing, and that they wished to examine the contents of our bags, which we evaded and got our plunder safe into the yard. The crowd now began to encrease, and I heard them debating the matter rather warmly on the outside. Soon afterwards they came into the yard in a body, with Seied Yusuff and the Nayib's messenger at their head; there were also among the foremost the Sheik-el Belled, and the Sheik of the mosque. Abdallah being called, they began a most lamentable complaint against our proceedings; said these stones were sacred to the dead, and that the Nayib had positively forbidden that any of them should be removed. The Nayib's man, however, who was spokesman, said nothing as from himself, but premised every sentence with \"Thus do they infer.\" The Seied Yusuff also (having been previously bribed) kept a becoming silence. So I cut the matter short, by telling them that they might rest assured that I should do nothing but what the Nayib approved, and that I should not think of arguing with them on the subject (whom it did not at all concern), but would settle the matter with their superior when we arrived at Massowah. This I told them was my determination, and forbade Abdallah to interpret another word on the subject. The only fear now was that we should not get any animal to carry them away. As soon, therefore, as tranquillity was a little restored, we took an opportunity of making rather a larger present than we had intended to the two sheiks, and distributed the remainder of our tobacco among the lower order. This completely removed their scruples, and they imme-\ndiately assisted most cordially in repacking the sacred spoils, and in fastening them on the back of a camel. It was eleven o'clock before we got away.\" Vol. 2, page 235-6.\n\nWhen the trouble and expense that have attended the procuring this tomb-stone are considered, it will be matter of regret with every one that these had not the good fortune to be bestowed on some object of greater interest. In this instance, as in many others, the risk of life, as well as the perseverance and zeal of the traveller, have been thrown away upon an object that had much better have remained in the sanctuary in which it had been set up.\n\nThis stone and its epitaph might be adduced as one of the many facts which prove, that females in Muhammadan countries enjoy a degree of respect and consideration little short of what exists in Europe.\n\nThe duration which has been, and seems likely to be the lot of this simple grave-stone, might well be coveted for the sepulchral monuments of the most celebrated individuals. It records the burial of a female of the lower orders, who died nearly eight hundred years ago. It has been executed with care, and, when the station in life of the parties is considered, evidently at considerable expense. This could scarcely have been the case at so remote a period, in an obscure town, or rather village, on the coast of the Red Sea, if females had not held that rank in society for which they were intended by nature, and which may always be considered as the surest standard of the civilization and refinement of every people.\n\nI should not have thought it worthy the attention of the Society but for the antiquity of the inscription, which affords at once a longer and more undoubted specimen of Cufic characters than is to be found in any other relic of the same age with which I am acquainted. I was besides informed, that though a plate of it is published in Lord Valentia's Travels, it had hitherto remained undeciphered, and that a translation of it would be acceptable to the Society.\n\nIt seemed of use, therefore, to have it exactly copied, as it might afford some facility in making out similar inscriptions at a future period. It likewise appeared to me that it might not be altogether uninteresting to the European reader to know how nations, thought to be so dissimilar in usages and manners from ourselves, testified the last feelings of sorrow for departed friends and relatives. I beg leave, therefore, to submit a few brief remarks\non the stone and its inscription; and to subjoin a transcript in modern Arabic characters, together with a translation.\n\nThe stone, which is an unhewn misshapen mass, and very hard, is twenty-three inches long and fifteen inches broad, and is of that variety of the trap family of rocks, to which the term clinkstone seems the most applicable.* The surface had never been polished, and the engraver or stone-cutter took advantage of the natural fracture of the stone, as it was sufficiently smooth for his purpose. The letters are so slightly raised, that the hand might be passed over the surface of the stone without the idea being suggested that characters existed upon it. Indeed the relief is so inconsiderable, that the stone has been little more than abraded by the chisel.\n\nFrom the perfect state in which the stone even now is, it is clear that the climate of the country where it has lain must have been most favourable to its preservation, as in some parts the touch of the graver has the freshness of a recent work, a circumstance that would be very conceivable had it been brought from the all-preserving climate of Egypt; but which we were not prepared to expect on the variable shore of the Red Sea. A similar stone exposed in our own climate, would, after twenty years, have shewn more symptoms of decay.\n\nThe inscription is in Arabic, written in Cufic characters, and of that form which is found full one hundred years later on the coins of the Seljuk sovereigns, as may be seen on referring to the plates of Mr. Marsden's excellent work on Oriental Numismatics. The letters are not of that simple, formal kind that belong to the earliest Cufic monuments, but are varied and twisted into shapes that render them rather puzzling at first sight.\n\nThe inscription consists of fourteen lines, of which the first nine and a half contain what may be considered the usual formulary for such monuments, being a passage taken from the Koran. I find the same passage occurring on the tomb-stone of the celebrated Mir Jumlah, which has been just added to the Society's Museum; and of which I purpose to give a notice at some future period.\n\nSubsequently to deciphering the inscription, I was favoured by our Secretary with a sort of translation of the formulary, written down by his\n\n* I am indebted for this information to Dr. Mac Culloch, so well known for his profound acquaintance with geology.\nbrother, as dictated to him by Mirza Jafer, one of the young Persian gentlemen sent to this country about fifteen years since by Prince Abbas M\u00edrza, the heir apparent to the throne of Persia. This was evidently only made from a knowledge of the Koran, and of the common formulary on grave-stones, and not from his being able to decypher the character. Had this been the case, he would have given some explanation of the rest of the inscription.\n\nThe stone-cutter has given a letter too much in the word \u0628\u06cc\u0646 bain of the sixth line; and I was at first inclined to think, that he had introduced an \\alif where it ought not to be in the phrase \u0627\u06cc\u062f\u06cc\u0645 aidhim; but I now think the letter \\alif of the line beneath has perhaps been lengthened to give a little variety and symmetry to the line above, and to prevent the monotonous recurrence of three letters which have nearly similar forms in the inscription. The word \u0634\u062f-a occurs with three dots, as in naskh characters.\n\nIn the benedictory sentence, beginning at the thirteenth line, we have though the form is commonly, as is well known, \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0644\u0644\u0647 Alhamdu lillah; and from the fanciful turn given to the letter \u062f dal of the word \u062d\u0645\u062f hamd,* it might at first be supposed that it had an \\alif too much. But it is obvious that where illiterate workmen are employed mistakes do frequently occur; and in this and similar cases, when once cut into the stone, they cannot be obliterated without repolishing the surface and running the chance of fresh errors.\n\n* My friend Mirza Ibrahim of Shiraz, now assistant professor at Haileybury College, whom I consulted on this expression, suggests that \u062d\u0645\u062f\u064b\u0627 \u0644\u0644\u0647 hamdan lillah, may have been intended; a form which he says is used \u0628\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0628 bain al ar\u00e1b (among the wandering Arabs).\n\u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062d\u064a\u0645\n\n\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0644\u0627 \u062a\u0623\u062e\u0630\u0647 \u0633\u0646\u0629 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u0646\u0648\u0645 \u0644\u0647 \u0645\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0648\u0627\u062a \u0648\u0645\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0631\u0636 \u0645\u0646 \u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u064a\u0634\u0641\u0639 \u0639\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0630\u0646\u0647 \u064a\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0645\u0627 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u064a\u062f\u064a\u0647\u0645 \u0648\u0645\u0627 \u062e\u0644\u0641\u0647\u0645 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062d\u064a\u0637\u0648\u0646 \u0628\u0634\u064a\u0621 \u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0645\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0628\u0645\u0627 \u0634\u0627\u0621 \u0648\u0633\u0639 \u0643\u0631\u0633\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0648\u0627\u062a \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0631\u0636 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0648\u062c\u062f \u062d\u0641\u0638\u0647\u0645\u0627 \u0648\u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0638\u064a\u0645 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0642\u0628\u0631 \u0641\u0627\u0637\u0645\u0629 \u0628\u0646\u062a \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0637 \u062a\u062f\u0641\u0646\u062a \u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062b \u0644\u0639\u0634\u0631 \u062e\u0644\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645 \u0633\u0646\u0629 \u062a\u0633\u0639\u0629 \u0648\u062b\u0644\u0627\u062b\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0631\u0628\u0639\u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0629 \u0648\u062d\u0645\u062f\u0627 \u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0635\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0648\u0622\u0644\u0647 \u0648\u0633\u0644\u0645 \u062a\u0633\u0644\u064a\u0645\u0627\nTranslation.\n\nIN THE NAME OF GOD, CLEMENT AND MERCIFUL.\n\nGOD!

From April 1816 to June 1821, it was placed in a northern verandah of a low-roomed house, quite out of the influence of radiated heat or partial currents of wind, but exposed to all winds, and hanging about eight feet above the common level of the plain. From the 1st of June to the end of November 1823 it hung about 20 feet higher, but in other respects the same as to aspect and exposure to air. The diurnal fluctuations of the mercurial column are now so well known as no longer to excite surprise; but the occasion of them, when not accounted for by corresponding changes in the atmosphere, has not yet been clearly explained. In a period of several years, I have found the deviation in the rise and fall of the mercury, at stated times in the twenty-four hours, so regular as to be able to reduce it to general rules. Thus I found the mercurial column attained its greatest elevation by about 10 A.M., and remained stationary till 2; its decline then commenced, and continued till 4 P.M. It remained stationary from that hour to 6 P.M. After 6 it again began to rise, and the same course of change as was exhibited by day continued through the night.\n\nThe moment of its beginning to rise and its continuance often varied, however, and so did the fall, but it may be inferred generally that the minimum elevation of the mercurial column is at 6 in the morning and 6 in the evening; and its maximum at noon and midnight. The fall of the mercury each day is generally twice as great as the rise, or nearly so, as will appear from an inspection of the annexed table of the rise and fall for a whole year.\n**APPENDIX**\n\n*Synopsis of the Daily Variations of the Mercurial Column in the Barometer for every Month of the Year 1822.*\n\n| Date | JANUARY | FEBRUARY | MARCH | APRIL | MAY | JUNE

Fluctuations exhibited in the preceding Table.\n\nIn January 1822, the atmospheric phenomena in this month produce no material irregularity in the flux and reflux of the mercurial column.\n\nFebruary. On the 2d and 3d, the rise and fall appear to be but little and nearly equal, the result was strong winds with rain. On the 6th, 7th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th and 15th, similar irregularities occur, and were followed by like results. On the 25th and 26th the rise was great, and the descent of the mercury began before 12 at noon. The result was, both days stormy.\n\nMarch 1st and 2d. The rise and fall equal; the result, squally weather.\n5th. The fall greatly exceeded the rise; result, squally weather.\n6th, 7th and 15th. The rise and fall nearly equal; result, squally weather.\n16th. The rise greater than the fall; result, squalls with thunder.\n18th. The fall greatest; result, squalls, thunder, hail and rain.\n21st and 24th. The fall greatest; result, strong winds in violent gusts.\n29th. The fall of the mercury began before noon and was great, and between 4 and 6 p.m. it rose one-tenth of an inch. This was followed by a gale of wind, with rain, thunder and lightning.\n30th. The rise and fall irregular; the result, storms, with rain, thunder, &c.\n\nApril 1st and 2d. The rise and fall were irregular, but no material atmospheric changes followed.\n4th. The fall was great and rise small; result, squalls, rain and thunder.\n5th. Both fall and rise, great and equal; the result, squalls, rain and thunder.\n20th to 23d. Rise and fall unsteady. The weather unsettled.\n\nMay 2d and 3d. The rise small, the fall great. Squally with strong winds.\n5th. Rise and fall equal; result, unsettled weather.\n10th, 11th, 14th, 19th, 24th, 27th, and 28th. The fall and rise on these days irregular, and the weather squally with strong winds, thunder, and rain.\n\nJune. The rise and fall of the mercury irregular throughout this month, influenced no doubt by the commencement of the periodical rains.\n\nJuly and August. The irregularities noticed last month continue in these months, and may be also attributed to the periodical rains.\n\nSeptember 1st the fall of the mercury was six times greater than the rise. The result was stormy weather with thunder, lightning, and much rain.\n9th and 10th. No rise; the result thunder, lightning, and heavy rain.\n12th. The rise did not begin before 8 a.m., it was followed by rain.\n\nOctober. The rise and fall of the Barometer on the 2d, 3d, 5th and 6th, were irregular, and the weather within that interval was squally and wet: but the same irregularity occurred on the 11th, 16th, 18th, 19th and 20th, without any corresponding atmospheric changes.\n\nNovember. The equality in the rise and fall in the first eight days of this month, has at other seasons of the year been followed with bad weather, but in the present instance no such consequence resulted. On the 10th the fall of the mercury began at 1 a.m., and at 2 p.m. it was rising and continued to rise till 6 p.m. (a very unusual thing). On the 22d a similar irregularity occurred, but in both instances was unattended by any material atmospheric phenomenon.\n\nDecember. The oscillations of the mercurial column in this month were active, and variable, but atmospheric changes occurred but seldom. The prevailing winds were N.W. and the weather fine.\n\nThe mean, rise, and fall of the Barometer, in the annexed Table, for each month, is shown by dividing the totals of each column by the number of days in the corresponding month.\n\n| Months   | Rise | Fall |\n|----------|------|------|\n| January  | .058 | .089 |\n| February | .060 | .086 |\n| March    | .054 | .096 |\n| April    | .058 | .101 |\n| May      | .048 | .089 |\n| June     | .034 | .066 |\n| July     | .035 | .054 |\n| August   | .037 | .067 |\n| September| .034 | .073 |\n| October  | .051 | .067 |\n| November | .047 | .066 |\n| December | .057 | .064 |\nRegister of the Hygrometer for Eight Years, registered at the same Hours as the Thermometrical Observations in the preceding Tables.\n\n| Years | 1816 | 1817 | 1818 | 1819 | 1820 | 1821 | 1822 | 1823 |\n|-------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Months | Max. | Min. | Max. | Min. | Max. | Min. | Max. | Min. |\n| January | \u2014 | \u2014 | 10\u00b011 | 2\u00b002 | 10\u00b078 | 2\u00b035 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| February | \u2014 | \u2014 | 10\u00b010 | 2\u00b055 | 10\u00b085 | 1\u00b090 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| March | 4\u00b090 | 2\u00b000 | 10\u00b095 | 2\u00b024 | 10\u00b030 | 1\u00b060 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| April | 5\u00b077 | 2\u00b062 | 10\u00b090 | 2\u00b046 | 10\u00b020 | 2\u00b020 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| May | 8\u00b012 | 2\u00b040 | 10\u00b018 | 3\u00b000 | 10\u00b020 | 2\u00b020 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| June | 9\u00b004 | 2\u00b060 | 10\u00b020 | 4\u00b030 | 10\u00b020 | 3\u00b045 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| July | 9\u00b097 | 4\u00b087 | 10\u00b022 | 5\u00b050 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| August | 10\u00b001 | 4\u00b045 | 10\u00b024 | 4\u00b080 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| September | 10\u00b010 | 3\u00b089 | 10\u00b037 | 4\u00b010 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| October | 10\u00b014 | 2\u00b028 | 10\u00b026 | 3\u00b010 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| November | 10\u00b011 | 2\u00b005 | 10\u00b025 | 2\u00b062 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| December | 10\u00b010 | 2\u00b030 | 10\u00b022 | 2\u00b060 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n\nFrom long-continued attention to my Hygrometer (Capt. Kater's), I placed much dependence on its sensibility. On some occasions I have noticed its changes were occasioned by passing clouds, at times of the day when the index previously had indicated much dryness; when the cloud had passed over, the index soon regained the point from which it had moved half an hour before. The high numbers indicated in the columns of the maximum, occurred in the early hours of the morning, and were greater or less according to the continuance and density of the fogs.\n\nThe instrument always stood at a distance from any door or window, but both doors and windows being open, it received all the influence of a moist or a dry atmosphere. The low numbers indicate a very dry state of the atmosphere; at 2\u00b060 the leather binding and thin pasteboard covering of books began to curl, and at from 2\u00b000 to 1\u00b060 pens split as soon as laid aside, ink uncovered was rapidly absorbed, and water standing in a porous earthen vessel cooled by evaporation to ten degrees below the thermometer.\n\nThe scale or range of this instrument was to 11\u00b094, the point of complete saturation.\n\nThe blanks in this table were occasioned by the hygrometer being under repair. Its action was impaired by dust, but was restored by cleaning.\n### Appendix\n\n#### Rain and Fogs\n\n**Enumeration of Days on which Rain has fallen at Dum Dum in every Month from 1816 to 1823 inclusive; also of Foggy Mornings, distinguished by the terms Dense and Light, the quantity floating in the Atmosphere on the Mornings registered.**\n\n| Months | 1816 | 1817 | 1818 | 1819 | 1820 | 1821 | 1822 | 1823 |\n|--------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|        | Rain.| Fog. | Rain.| Fog. | Rain.| Fog. | Rain.| Fog. |\n|        | Dense.| Light | D.

The country for many miles round Calcutta is almost a flat surface, the plains of Dum Dum only exceeding the height of the spring tides about eight feet, and it is not much above thirty feet higher than the level of the sea.\n\nVol. II.\nTable of the prevailing Winds in every Month of the Year, during eight Years, registered at the same times with the other Atmospheric Phenomena recorded in the

The extensive and valuable collections of Oriental MSS. which are deposited in our public and private libraries, have long attracted the attention of the learned of this and other countries; and it has been suggested that some means, offering a reasonable prospect of success, may be devised, by which the public may be put in possession of all that is valuable in Eastern literature, and an opportunity be presented for shewing that this country is not at present backward in contributing to the advancement of Oriental learning, in which she has long held the foremost rank. The interesting relations, moreover, in which this country stands with the East, affording as they do the best opportunities for carrying such a project into effect, and at the same time promising both to England and its Eastern possessions the most beneficial results, may be mentioned as additional motives for engaging in such an undertaking.\n\n2. The advantages likely to be derived from a more extensive cultivation of Oriental literature in this country may be considered as applicable to Biblical Criticism, Ecclesiastical and General History, Biography, Belles-Lettres, the Arts and Sciences, and Geography.\n\n3. With reference to Biblical Criticism and Ecclesiastical History, we know that our Scriptures, particularly those of the Old Testament, abound in modes of expression, and allusions to customs, in many cases imperfectly understood in Europe, but still prevailing in the East. That light confessedly derived from the Arabic and other sister dialects of the Hebrew, has been thrown on the text of Scripture by the Rabbinical and other commentators, few will deny; yet volumes on Arabic Grammar, Rhetoric, and the more ancient productions of the Arabian poets, which approach most nearly in style and sentiments to some parts of the Hebrew Bible, still lie in MS. in our libraries, either entirely neglected, or at best accessible to few.\n\n4. In the Syriac language, which approximates still nearer than the Arabic to the Hebrew in its form and modes of expression, there are in our libraries unpublished Grammars and Dictionaries, and even Commentaries on the Scriptures, written by the Bishops and other learned members of the Oriental churches, together with MS. works of the greatest value to Divines, on Ecclesiastical History and Divinity, composed by the fathers of the Syrian and Arabian churches. The collection also of the late Mr. Rich, now placed in the British Museum by the liberality of Parliament, contains perhaps the most valuable MSS. of the Syriac Scriptures now in existence; and it is of the greatest importance to Biblical criticism that a collation of them should be made and published.\n\n5. Perhaps no people possess more extensive stores of History, Biography, and Polite Literature, than the Arabs and Persians. The accounts which their historical and biographical works contain of their own and the surrounding countries, are necessarily the principal sources from which information can be obtained relative to the history of those regions, and of the extraordinary persons to whom they have given birth. Their histories of the Crusades in particular, which furnish the most authentic details on this interesting subject, will always amuse and instruct the general reader, while they furnish materials of the greatest importance to the\nhistorian. In Polite Literature, and especially in works of fiction, they have perhaps never been excelled, and in studying such of their works in Belles-Lettres as have been already printed in any European language, regret must be felt that but few of these books, which are so well calculated to afford us pleasure, have been translated.\n\n6. Whatever may be our present superiority over Asia in the arts and sciences, it cannot be uninteresting to the inquiring mind to recur to the sources from which we derived the first elements of our knowledge. In this respect Asia must be recognized as the elder sister and instructress of Europe; and although the hordes of barbarians, which poured forth like a torrent from her north-western regions, effectually extinguished the light which she at first imparted, yet we are indebted to the Mohammedan courts of Cordova, Grenada, and Seville, for its restoration, as it is to them that Europe owes the rudiments of many of her now highly cultivated arts and sciences.\n\n7. From Asiatic works on the Mathematics and Medicine perhaps much light is not now to be expected. To trace the progress of these sciences, however, under the Caliphat, when science had declined among the Greeks, cannot be uninteresting to the philosopher. And as many of the most celebrated of the Greek authors were translated into Arabic, under the patronage of the court of Bagdad, it is not improbable that some long-lost Greek works may be discovered in an Arabian dress, as was the case with the treatise on Conic Sections by Apollonius Pergaeus, brought to Europe by Golius, and translated by Halley.\n\n8. From the mercantile pursuits of the Arabs, foreign countries were explored, and commercial establishments formed by them, at an early period of their history; and it is anticipated that accounts of their travels may be discovered, not less interesting than those of Ibn Batuta, noticed by Mr. Burckhardt, and of which some specimens have been published by Kosegarten and Apetz, or of the two Mohammedans who visited India and China in the ninth century, translated and published by the learned Renaudot.\n\n9. But while the literature of the East in general is highly worthy of our notice, that of British India has an especial claim to our regard. The possession of a more intimate acquaintance with the History, Geography, Statistics, Laws, and Usages of that portion of our Empire, must be productive of good both to the governors and the governed; and to procure means for obtaining information on these subjects is one of the principal designs of this Prospectus.\n\n10. The object proposed is, to publish, free of expense to the Authors, translations of the whole or parts of such works in the Oriental languages as the Oriental Translation Committee shall approve. These translations are generally to be accompanied by the original texts printed separately, and such illustrations as may be considered necessary. By the publication of the original text it is intended to multiply copies of such works as are scarce, and to furnish students at a moderate expense with correct copies of the best Asiatic works, to which they might not otherwise have access.\n\n11. It is not intended to confine the operations of the Committee to works in the Arabic, Persian, and Syriac languages; it is their intention to translate and publish standard and interesting works in Sanscrit, Chinese, Pali, Cingalese, and Burmese; in the languages of Thibet, Tartary, and Turkey; in the Malayan, and other dialects of the Eastern Archipelago; and in the numerous dialects of Hindustan, and the southern peninsula of India.\n\n12. It cannot be expected that the publication of Oriental texts and translations can be effected to any considerable extent, by the efforts of individuals, for none but a public body can command the funds, or furnish the literary means necessary for such an undertaking. The Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, which was instituted for the advancement of Oriental literature, is the only Institution\nin this country to which the public can look with any prospect of success for the accomplishment of such a project; and the Council of that Society have expressed their willingness to co-operate in the execution of the plan which it is the object of this Prospectus to make known. They have subscribed largely from their funds; have selected a Committee, consisting of individuals well known for their zeal and attainments in Eastern literature, to superintend the editing, translating, and printing of the works that are to be published; and have granted the use of their house for the transaction of the business of the Committee:\u2014thus affording the best proofs of their readiness to promote the proposed object, and the strongest guarantee to the public that such works as may be recommended for publication will be executed in a manner that will render them worthy of the patronage that is now solicited.\n\n13. For the purpose of directing the attention of Scholars to the literature of the East, and encouraging translations, the Oriental Translation Committee will give annually, for such works or portions of works as they consider deserving of distinction, four rewards in money, in sums of from \u00a350 to \u00a3100 each, and four gold medals of the value of fifteen guineas each, inscribed with the names of the individuals to whom they are presented. Translators whose works are approved, will be entitled to either description of reward, unless they expressly limit their views to the medals. The rewards and medals will be conferred at the Annual Meeting; and success on one occasion will not disqualify for receiving rewards or medals at future anniversaries. Any Member of the Committee who sends a work for approval, whether with a view to obtaining a reward or medal, or merely to have it printed at the Committee's expense, is to cease to act on the Committee until a decision is given on his work.\n\n14. The Oriental Translation Committee now appeal to the liberality of the public for such pecuniary aid as will enable them to effect the objects proposed in this Prospectus. The sums contributed will be appropriated exclusively to the execution of the plan above detailed, and the accounts will be examined, and a report made annually to the Subscribers of the application of the Funds, by an Auditor, who is to be elected by and from the body of the Subscribers. A report of the progress made in translating and printing during the year will also be made to the Subscribers annually, and notices will be given of such works as the Committee may intend to print at the expense of the Funds contributed by the Subscribers.\n\n15. The terms of subscription are, that every individual or institution subscribing Ten Guineas or upwards annually, will be entitled to one fine-paper copy of every work translated, printed, and published by the Committee, with the name of the individual or institution subscribing printed on the back of the title-page. Individuals or Institutions subscribing Five Guineas annually, will be entitled to any of the works published by the Committee, to the amount of their subscription, at half the price paid for them by Non-subscribers. The remaining copies, after a certain number has been given to the Translator or Editor for presentation, will be disposed of by the Committee in such a manner as they may consider most conducive to their objects, and to the advancement of Oriental literature.\n\n16. The Committee propose to open communications with the Literary Societies, the British Governors and Consuls, and learned individuals in Asia and Africa, for the purpose of procuring scarce and valuable Oriental MSS. They also intend to communicate with the Oriental scholars in this and other countries, for the purpose of bringing to light texts and translations of valuable Oriental works, which may now lie in MS. in public and private libraries; and thus, by every available means, to endeavour to preserve what might otherwise be irrecoverably lost, and to make known original works and translations which might otherwise never meet the public eye.\n\n17. The Committee confidently expect that valuable translations will be obtained from Asia, as they feel assured that many civil and military officers residing there have hitherto been deterred from translating Oriental works by their having no opportunity for publishing the result of their labours in England. As that opportunity is now\noffered, it is hoped that they will be stimulated by the desire of improvement in the Asiatic languages, and the prospect of acquiring celebrity in Europe, to make translations and avail themselves of the means of publication presented in this Prospectus. For the purpose of obtaining Translations and Subscriptions from Asia, learned men in India, Ceylon, Penang, China, &c. will be invited to form themselves into Corresponding Committees.\n\n18. The willingness already evinced to further this design, induces the Committee to entertain the most lively hopes of success. From the list of distinguished names prefixed and appended to this Prospectus they have the greatest encouragement to proceed, and have every reason to expect that the execution of the plan will be materially assisted by the British Universities.\n\n19. It is requested that those individuals who are willing to become subscribers to the Oriental Translation Fund will send their names and addresses to the Secretary, Mr. William Huttman, at the house of the Royal Asiatic Society, No. 14, Grafton Street, Bond Street, London; and that they will inform him where their subscriptions will be paid. Subscriptions will also be received by such Houses of Agency as may be nominated by the Corresponding Committees in Asia.\n\nLIST OF ANNUAL SUBSCRIPTIONS.\n\n| Name                                                                 | \u00a3  s. d. |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| His Royal Highness the Duke of Clarence                              | 21 0 0  |\n| His Royal Highness the Duke of Sussex                                | 10 10 0 |\n| His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge                             | 10 10 0 |\n| His Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester                            | 10 10 0 |\n| His Royal Highness Prince Leopold of Saxe Coburg                     | 21 0 0  |\n| The Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland\u2014being the amount of the Hon.

They feel anxious, however, to make the Subscribers acquainted with what they have done up to the present time, and with their future intentions, prospects, and hopes.\n\nThe Committee have great satisfaction in stating that the most liberal support has been afforded to them by the Royal Asiatic Society, not only by their allowing the Committee's business to be transacted in their house, but also by their handsome transfer to the Oriental Translation Fund of the Honourable East-India Company's munificent annual subscription of one hundred guineas.\n\nThe English Universities have expressed their favourable disposition towards the undertaking, and received in the most friendly manner the hopes expressed by the Committee, of considerably diminishing the expense of printing by the assistance of the University presses.\n\nAlthough essentially assisted by the enlightened views of the great literary bodies in England, the attention of the Committee has been directed to obtaining aid from distant quarters also; and they confidently hope that another annual meeting will not pass, without the communication of gratifying accounts from various parts of Asia and Africa.\n\nConsiderably within a year, copies of the Prospectus will have been received at the capitals of Turkey, Persia, Egypt, and the Barbary States, and by the numerous Consuls and mercantile firms existing on the eastern and southern shores of the Mediterranean.\n\nThe opportunity offered by the intimate connexion of this country with Asia has been\neagerly embraced by the Committee, who have sought every means of communicating with Europeans residing even in its most inland countries.\n\nThe Presidencies of India will be centres from which Prospectuses will be forwarded to every Indian court, and to the confines of the Punjab, Tibet, and China; everywhere, it is hoped, awakening among our distant countrymen a desire to become known to the learned in Europe, through the means offered by this Committee.\n\nIntimations of our object will also be forwarded to every mart and settlement of the Eastern ocean, extending to the most distant havens of its Archipelago, and to the coasts of China and Japan.\n\nThe various Missionary establishments, whether in India, Palestine, the Caucasus, or the Malayan peninsula, and the enlightened employ\u00e9s of the Russian Government, extending along the extensive southern frontier of the Russian empire to the furthest limits of Kamtschatka, will also be made acquainted with our existence and objects.\n\nThe majority, however, of these communications has been addressed to natives of Britain; and it is from them the Committee principally expect co-operation and support, in the attainment of their truly national object.\n\nThe principle of these appeals for literary and pecuniary assistance, in common with the rest of their proceedings, requires the sanction of the Subscribers; but the Committee have been obliged to anticipate the confirmation of their acts, to prevent their losing opportunities of communicating with India.\n\nThey hope that they will not be considered to have erred, as they have strictly conformed to the spirit of the Prospectus, the approval of which may be inferred from the patronage it has received.\n\nLetters have been addressed to the Governor-General of India, the Governors of Madras, Bombay, Ceylon, Prince of Wales' Island, and Mauritius, and to the Presidents of the Literary Societies at the three Presidencies and Ceylon, proposing the formation of Corresponding Committees, to consist of the principal Oriental scholars residing in or near Calcutta, Madras, Bombay, Columbo, George Town, and Port Louis.\n\nThe instructions for these Corresponding Committees, contained in letters of which a specimen is subjoined, although leaving them as uncontrolled as great distance and local differences necessarily require, will, it is hoped, be found to be strictly consonant with the general tenour of the Prospectus.\n\nLetter to the Governor-General of India.\n\n\"My Lord:\u2014We trust that we may with confidence address your Lordship on the subject of the accompanying Prospectus, which has received general approbation in this country, and promises the most valuable results to Oriental literature.\n\nAlthough the Oriental Translation Committee confidently rely on the abilities and zeal of learned individuals in England, still they look to their highly gifted countrymen in the East for great and efficient assistance.\n\nThis expectation, we are convinced, will not be disappointed; and we address your Lordship, as Governor-General of India, to solicit your Lordship's powerful aid, in the promotion of the extensive and important objects that are stated in the Prospectus.\n\nOur views in this letter are directed to the formation of an efficient Corresponding Committee at Calcutta; and we presume to request that, in concert with the President of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, your Lordship will make a selection of persons from among the Europeans and natives residing within your Lordship's Government, to constitute that Committee.\n\nWhen the Committee is appointed, we shall feel grateful for your Lordship's transmitting this letter to them; and we request that they will guide themselves by the spirit of the Prospectus, of which a considerable number is sent for distribution by them.\n\nThe Corresponding Committee is requested to make such additions to the Prospectus as local circumstances may render necessary; and to have them addressed to the persons referred to in the enclosed list, and to such others as they may consider likely to promote their views.\"\nThe expense of making those additions and of printing more Prospectuses (if those sent are not sufficient), as also that of transcribing translations and procuring their Oriental originals for the Committee in England, will be defrayed by that Committee, if, contrary to expectation, the sum collected in Bengal is inadequate to the payment.\n\nThe Corresponding Committee is empowered to add to its number, to make bye-laws agreeing with the spirit of the Prospectus, to suggest to the Committee in England improved means for attaining their objects, and to appoint houses of agency to receive subscriptions. They will also present those rewards or medals which may be awarded at home to residents in Bengal, and transmit copies of the works printed by the Committee in England to subscribers residing in that presidency.\n\nTheir most important duty, however, will be obtaining and transmitting to the Committee at home translations of Oriental MSS., accompanied by the original texts.\n\nIt is desirable that a meeting of the Subscribers residing in Bengal should be held annually in December, to receive a report from the Corresponding Committee, and to be informed of what has been done by the Committee in England.\u2014A copy of that Report should be transmitted to the Committee in London.\n\nThe Oriental Translation Committee hope that the Corresponding Committee of Calcutta will not limit their views to Europeans, but will also endeavour to excite qualified natives to furnish translations. They also hope, that should any parts of this letter or of the Prospectus be considered ambiguous, the Corresponding Committee will interpret them according to their own judgment, without waiting for explanations from Europe.\n\nWe indulge the hope that, under your Lordship's auspices, the Corresponding Committee will be able to obtain the assistance of the Native Princes residing in or near your Lordship's Government, by pointing out to them the advantages that will accrue to the learned natives in their dominions, from being furnished with printed texts of scarce and valuable Oriental Manuscripts; and we trust that your Lordship will promote this desirable object, by permitting the letters, &c. addressed to the Native Princes to be sent through the Residents at their courts.\n\nWe shall also be grateful for your Lordship's permitting the letters of the Corresponding Committee to be delivered free of postage within your Lordship's Government, and for your Lordship's allowing the communications from the Committee in Calcutta to the Committee in London to be forwarded through the authorities in England.\n\nWe trust that we may in a few months receive the gratifying intelligence of the inauguration of the Corresponding Committee, and of your Lordship and the Asiatic Society of Bengal (which we have addressed through its president) having displayed a degree of interest, commensurate with the importance of the object proposed to your Lordship's notice, and placed under your Lordship's patronage, &c.\n\nWe have the honour to be, &c.\n\n(Signed) Gore Ouseley,\nG. T. Staunton,\nE. H. East,\nA. Johnston,\nMark Wilks,\nG. Fitzclarence.\"\n\nLetter to the President of the Asiatic Society of Bengal.\n\nSir:\u2014We have the honour of transmitting to you the duplicate of a Letter addressed to the Right Honourable the Governor-General of India, requesting his Lordship, in concert with yourself, to nominate a Committee at Calcutta, to obtain Translations, &c.; and we take the liberty of suggesting the desirableness of such members of the General Committee as reside in or near Calcutta being appointed Members of the Corresponding Committee.\n\nFrom the zeal which yourself, and the learned body over which you preside, display in the cultivation of Oriental literature, we anticipate with confidence that you will render the most important assistance in the attainment of our proposed object.\n\nWe have the honour to be, &c.\n\n(Signed as above.)\nThe Committee have great pleasure in informing the Subscribers that they received from Lord William Bentinck, Governor General of India, before his Lordship's departure, the most gratifying assurances of his Lordship's intention to forward their views, to the utmost extent of his power, on his arrival at Calcutta.\n\nAlthough zeal and efficiency may be confidently expected from all the Committees in Asia, it is impossible not to contemplate with peculiar satisfaction the auspices under which the Corresponding Committee will be formed at Bombay.\n\nFew gentlemen occupying stations of authority and influence possess such means of effectively assisting the Committee as Sir John Malcolm, whose Oriental learning, and activity in the promotion of knowledge, are brilliant examples for every person, not only under his own, but also under every other Indian Government, to endeavour to imitate.\n\nThe attention that the Prospectus and letters will excite in India must, in the opinion of the Committee, create a desire for improvement in the Oriental languages among the junior Civil and Military Officers residing there; and it will be the duty of the Corresponding Committees, to foster that feeling, and transmit to Europe its beneficial results.\n\nAfter preparing instructions for their Corresponding Committees, the Committee prepared a few regulations for their own government. These regulations will be submitted to you this day for amendment; or, if approved, for confirmation.\n\nThe Committee hope that the latitude they have proposed for themselves will only be considered an evidence of their extensive hopes and views, and that the Subscribers, in giving these regulations their sanction, will leave the Committee unshackled, at least for the first year, that they may have the means of ascertaining their power to accomplish the objects for which they were appointed.\n\nAlthough most of these regulations have been formed on the basis of the original Prospectus, alterations have been suggested, which it was thought would add considerably to the usefulness and the pecuniary means of the Society:\u2014these are the creation of a second class of subscribers, and the sale of a certain number of each of the works printed at the expense of the Oriental Translation Fund.\n\nAs the Subscribers of Ten guineas each are entitled gratuitously to a fine-paper copy of every work published by the Committee, it is proposed that an annual subscriber of five guineas shall be entitled to any of the works published by the Committee, to the extent of subscription, at half the price paid for them by the public; but without having his name printed on the back of the title-page, that distinction being reserved for the first class of Subscribers.\n\nIn relation to the second proposal, it is calculated that the difference of expense between an edition of 250 and 500 copies of any book is only about 7 per cent. exclusive of paper: printing the latter number instead of the former, and selling the copies that remained on hand after the Subscribers are furnished with those to which they are entitled, would therefore defray a considerable part of the expense of printing any translation, and thus enable the Committee to print additional works. The following particulars are added, to show the advantage of printing some copies for sale of such works as the Committee may publish. An edition of 250 copies of a Persian and English work of 450 octavo pages would cost \u00a3125, or 10s. per copy; but the second 250 copies might be obtained for \u00a335, or about 2s. 10d. per copy. If the second 250 copies were gradually sold at only 10s. each, the whole expense of printing the work would be ultimately repaid, with the exception of \u00a335, for which sum 250 copies would be obtained by the Subscribers.\n\nThis calculation is founded on the supposition that none but really interesting works will be printed, and that there will consequently be a demand for them in England, on the Continent, and among Europeans in Asia. It is also confidently expected that many copies will be bought by learned natives of India, who may be either desirous of learning English or of possessing texts of standard Oriental works, free from the errors which often abound in manuscript copies.\nThe acting Treasurer has the honour to report to the Subscribers the state of the Society's funds made up to the present day.\n\nThe amount of subscriptions is \u00a31,128. 15s., from which is to be deducted the expense of printing and circulating the Prospectus and incidental charges.\n\nIf it should receive the approbation of the Subscribers, the annual subscriptions will be considered payable on the 1st of January in each year, the second subscription being reckoned due in January 1829.\n\nAs the Secretary will be very much occupied in transacting the business of the Committee, it is hoped that the payment of fifty pounds a year to him, from the 1st of January 1828, will be approved by the Subscribers.\n\nIn connexion with the finances, it only remains for the Subscribers to elect from among themselves a Treasurer for the ensuing year, and an Auditor, to report at the next annual meeting the receipts and disbursements of the Oriental Translation Fund for the year that will then terminate.\n\nThe Committee, after thus giving an account of their proceedings and of the state of their funds, venture to express a hope that a continuation and increase of support will enable them to extend their operations, in proportion as their views enlarge in the execution of their plan.\n\nIt is now the agreeable duty of the Committee to announce to the Subscribers the encouraging prospects which have been created by their munificent support. The prosperous state of their funds, the advantages presented by the English Universities and the Royal Asiatic Society, and the gratuitous aid tendered by many eminent Orientalists, warrants the belief that the Subscribers, in addition to enjoying the honour of fostering an important branch of learning, and rescuing the national character from the charge of neglecting Oriental literature, will annually receive books greatly exceeding their subscriptions in value.\n\nThe Committee are desirous to avoid attributing too much effect to their labours; but they feel bound to state, that they know that the circulation of their Prospectus has already stimulated some individuals to undertake translations of Oriental works, and has attracted much attention to Asiatic literature.\n\nThe inquiries of the Committee have already brought to light several translations which had long remained unnoticed, and they have received a valuable collection of Oriental MSS. which were collected by the late Sir Charles Malet, Bart. during his residence in India, and presented to them by his son, Sir Alexander Malet, Bart., as soon as he was informed of their establishment and objects. A Catalogue of this collection is annexed.\n\nAlthough, in selecting works for publication, the Committee's principal object will be to increase historical and general information, yet, in order to meet the taste of every class of the Subscribers, they have considered it proper to have some works of fiction translated, particularly as the East has furnished many highly interesting specimens of that species of literature, if even it is not the parent country of aplogues and romances.\n\nMay 7, 1828.\nCatalogue of Persian MSS., presented by Sir Alexander Malet, Bart.\n\nSh\u00e1h N\u00e1meh, by Firdousi, an Epic Poem, containing the History of the Kings of Persia.\n\nSh\u00e1h Jeh\u00e1n N\u00e1meh: imperfect.

The Committee which is attached to the Royal Asiatic Society for the purpose of selecting and superintending the translation and printing of Oriental works is to be called the \"Oriental Translation Committee.\"\n\n2d. The object of the Committee is to publish, free of expense to the authors, translations of the whole or parts of works in the Oriental languages, accompanied\ngenerally by the original texts, and such illustrations as may be considered necessary. These translations are to be generally printed in English, but in peculiar cases may be printed in Latin or French.\n\n3d. The Committee is empowered to add to its number, to purchase Oriental MSS. or printed books, to present copies of the works printed at the expense of the Oriental Translation Fund to learned Societies and individuals, and to adopt all the means that it may consider to be necessary for executing the plan developed in the Prospectus. No payment, however, exceeding twenty-five pounds, is to be made until approved at two successive Meetings of the Committee.\n\n4th. The Meetings of the Committee will be held as often as the Chairman or Secretary, or any two other Members of it, signing a requisition for that purpose, deem it necessary. All the Members of the Committee resident within one hundred miles of London, are to be summoned to attend each of its Meetings; and five Members, including the Chairman or a Deputy Chairman, and the Secretary, are to constitute a quorum.\n\n5th. The Secretary is charged generally with the business of the Committee, and is to record all the votes of the Committee in a Minute-Book, which every Subscriber has the right of inspecting on application to him.\n\n6th. For the purpose of directing the attention of scholars to the literature of the East, and encouraging translations, the Committee is empowered to give annually, for such works as it may consider deserving of distinction, four rewards in money, in sums of from \u00a350 to \u00a3100 each, and four gold medals of the value of fifteen guineas each, inscribed with the names of the individuals to whom they are presented. Any Member of the Committee who sends a work for approval, whether to obtain a reward or medal, or merely to have it printed at the expense of the Oriental Translation Fund, is to cease to act on the Committee until the adoption or rejection of his work is decided on.\n\n7th. No work, although prepared for the press at the expense of the Oriental Translation Fund, is to be printed, until the imprimatur of the Chairman or a Deputy Chairman, and at least twelve Members of the Committee, is obtained.\n\n8th. Every individual or institution subscribing ten guineas or upwards annually to the Oriental Translation Fund, will be entitled to one fine-paper copy of every work translated and printed by the Committee, with the name of the individual or institution subscribing printed on the back of the title-page.\n\nIndividuals or institutions subscribing five guineas annually, will be entitled to any of the works published by the Committee, to the amount of their subscriptions, at half the price paid for them by Non-subscribers.\n\n9th. A General Meeting of the Subscribers will be held on the first Wednesday in February, May, August, and November; and a Special General Meeting shall be convened by the Secretary at any time it is required in writing by nine Subscribers, the requisition stating the subject that is to be proposed for consideration.\n\n10th. A General Meeting will be held annually on the first Wednesday in May, to which every Subscriber and Member of the Committee resident in the United Kingdom will be summoned. At that meeting Regulations may be proposed or rescinded; the Auditor will report the receipts and disbursements of the past year; and the Secretary report the progress made in the works that have been commenced, and give an account of those that are proposed for publication in the following year. A copy of each of these Reports will be sent to every Subscriber.\nAt a Meeting of the Subscribers to the Oriental Translation Fund, held on Wednesday the 7th of May 1828, at the House of the Royal Asiatic Society,\n\nHis Royal Highness Prince Leopold of Saxe Coburg, in the Chair.\n\nA communication from Mr. Pettigrew was made to the Meeting, expressing His Royal Highness the Duke of Sussex's regret that he was prevented by indisposition from taking the Chair, as had been announced in the circular letter by which the Meeting was convened.\n\nThe Right Honourable Sir Gore Ouseley, Bart., Chairman of the Oriental Translation Committee, read the Prospectus explanatory of the objects of the Subscribers and Committee, the names of the Patrons and Subscribers, and Lists of the Committee, as originally selected by the Royal Asiatic Society, and as subsequently enlarged by the addition of some of the most eminent British Orientalists in various parts of the world.\n\nHe then read a Report of the Proceedings of the Committee from the date of its nomination to the present time, accompanied by a list of the Translations that have been offered to it for publication, and submitted to the consideration of the Subscribers the Regulations which had been prepared, for the government of the Committee, in the administration of the Oriental Translation Fund.\n\nIt was then moved by the Right Honourable Lord Viscount Melville, seconded by Sir Edward Hyde East, Bart., M.P., and\n\nResolved Unanimously,\n\"THAT the appointment of the Committee named in the list submitted to this Meeting be confirmed.\"\n\nMoved by the Right Honourable Charles Watkin Williams Wynn, M.P., seconded by Sir Edward Kerrison, Bart., M.P., and\n\nResolved Unanimously,\n\"THAT the report of the Committee be adopted, and their proceedings approved and confirmed.\"\n\nMoved by the Right Honourable the Earl of Cassilis, seconded by George Watson Taylor, Esq., M.P., and\n\nResolved Unanimously,\n\"THAT the Regulations for the Oriental Translation Committee be confirmed.\"\n\nMoved by Sir Alexander Johnston, Knt., seconded by the Right Honourable Sir Gore Ouseley, Bart., and\n\nResolved Unanimously,\n\"THAT the grateful thanks of this Meeting be returned to his Royal Highness the Duke of Clarence, for the zealous and efficient manner in which His Royal Highness has promoted the establishment of the Oriental Translation Fund.\"\n\nMoved by Sir Edward Kerrison, Bart., M.P., seconded by Sir J.

Huttmann,\nSecretary.\nAPPENDIX No. III.\n\nREPORT OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMMITTEE OF CORRESPONDENCE OF THE Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nAt the Annual Meeting of the Royal Asiatic Society, held on the 15th of March 1828, Sir Alexander Johnston, Chairman of the Committee of Correspondence, having verbally reported the proceedings of that Committee since its institution,\n\nIt was Resolved,\n\n\"That he be requested to reduce his Report to writing, and that it be printed in the Appendix to the Society's Transactions.\"\n\nREPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF CORRESPONDENCE.\n\nThe Committee of Correspondence understand it to be their duty,\n\n1st. To open and keep up a correspondence and communication with every Government, Society, and individual, who can in any way assist the literary and scientific objects of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\n2d. To inspire all such Governments, Societies, and individuals, with an interest in the success of the Royal Asiatic Society, and a zeal in promoting their researches in every part of the world.\n\n3d. To procure for the Royal Asiatic Society, and for such persons as may apply to the Committee, information relative to Asia, from every source and every country from which it can be derived; from every work, ancient and modern, in whatever language it may be written; from every servant of the Crown and of the East-India Company, whether civil, military, naval, or medical; from every diplomatic Agent and public Consul; from every Christian Missionary, whether Catholic or Protestant; from every traveller, trader, or navigator, whether Christian, Mahomedan, Hindoo, or Buddhist; and from every country in Europe, particularly from Portugal, Spain, Holland, Denmark, Italy, France, Germany, and Russia.\n\nWith this view of its duty, the Committee will now proceed to report to the Society what it has done within the last twelve months, in Great Britain, in India, and on the continent of Europe.\n\nIN GREAT BRITAIN.\n\nThe Committee have to report under this head, that they have opened and kept up a correspondence with the East-India Company, the Universities of Oxford and Cam-\nbridge, the Royal Institution, the Medico-Botanical Society, and the Mechanics' Institute.\n\nThe East-India Company.\n\nAs the East-India Company possess so extensive an empire in Asia, and so valuable a collection of Oriental works in this country, the Committee have felt it to be their duty to communicate with the Directors of that powerful body upon every occasion upon which their co-operation was material, and are happy to lay before the Members of the Society a detail of the circumstances which are connected with one of the communications, and the important result to which it has led. Sir Alexander Johnston having long considered it of importance to a general knowledge of Oriental literature in Europe, that English translations should be made of all such Oriental works as are believed to contain new or useful information, in any branch of science or literature, had frequent communications upon the subject with Professor Lee, whose talents, and knowledge of Oriental languages, have so justly placed him in the highest rank of Oriental scholars in Europe; and Sir Alexander, some months ago, received a letter from the Professor, of which the annexed is a copy (see Note 1).\n\nUpon the receipt of this letter, Sir Alexander spoke to Mr. Lindsay, the Chairman of the Court of Directors, and ascertained from him, that he agreed perfectly with Mr. Lee as to the utility of the plan which he proposed; and that he would willingly, if the plan were sent to him officially, lay it before the Court.\n\nSir Alexander Johnston then submitted the measure to the Council of the Royal Asiatic Society, which, upon the motion of Sir Alexander, sent a deputation of its Members, consisting of Sir Alexander Johnston, Dr. Babington, Sir R. Barclay, Colonel Doyle, and A. Macklew, Esq., to the Chairman of the Court of Directors, with a request that he would officially bring the subject before the Court. He accordingly did so, and the Court having approved of Professor Lee's proposal, in a very liberal manner voted an immediate donation of \u00a3105, and an annual subscription of \u00a3105 more, in furtherance of the object of the Royal Asiatic Society. (See Notes 2 and 3.) Sir Alexander knowing that the plan of making English translations of Oriental works was very popular with many persons, who in other respects felt little or no interest in questions relating to India, thought it advisable to take advantage of this feeling, and consulted upon the occasion with Colonel Fitzclarence, who throughout the proceedings had taken a most active and efficient part in favour of the measure.\n\nThe Colonel immediately spoke to His Royal Highness the Duke of Clarence, who, being satisfied of the policy of the plan, not only subscribed his own name to it, but with a zeal which had always marked his patronage of the Society, adopted immediate steps for ensuring the success of the measure. Sir Alexander also knowing the weight which the public would justly attach to the patronage of the head of the church to such a plan, obtained through Dr. D'Oyly, the patronage and subscription of the Archbishop of Canterbury to it; and a Committee has now been formed for carrying it into effect, which is composed of several Members of the Society, and some of the\nmost distinguished Oriental Scholars in England, under the direct patronage of His Majesty and the Royal Family; of the First Lord of the Treasury; of the heads of the Church, Navy, and Army, and of many of the most powerful and distinguished individuals in Great Britain.\n\nThe Universities of Oxford and Cambridge.\n\nThe high character which the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge hold in the estimation of the Government and of the people of England, the talents and erudition of their Members, the influence which they naturally exercise over the education, and the religious and moral opinions and feelings of the leading men in the country, the collections which they possess of Oriental works, the attention which they pay to Oriental literature, the efficient aid which they can afford, by means of their printing presses, to the printing of Oriental manuscripts, and of the English translations of them, must render their co-operation of the utmost importance to any Society in England that is engaged in researches into Oriental literature and science, many parts of which are often of so much use, in illustrating and explaining subjects which are intimately connected with the true reading and perfect understanding of the most remarkable passages in the Holy Scriptures. The Committee, therefore, took the earliest opportunity of opening a communication with both these learned bodies. With respect to Oxford, they have to report that Mr. Peel, as soon as he was informed by Sir Alexander Johnston of the objects of the Society, and the wishes of the Committee, not only promised his own support to their proceedings, but, with the liberal feeling and spirit which he evinces on every occasion in which the interests of literature and science are concerned, immediately wrote upon the subject to the Bishop of Oxford, on whose suggestion such a communication as the Committee had wished was soon after opened between the Delegates of the Clarendon press and the Royal Asiatic Society. With respect to Cambridge the Committee have to report, that through Professor Lee, a similar communication has been opened between some of the leading Members of that University and the Society, and that the result of these communications is that the two Universities approve of the proceedings of the Royal Asiatic Society, and that there is reason to believe they will afford the Society such assistance as their respective institutions will permit.\n\nThe Royal Institution.\n\nThe variety of the combinations of different metals which are used for domestic and other purposes by the natives of India; the variety of the materials which they manufacture, and of the substances of which their dyes are composed; the simplicity of the processes to which they have recourse in their several manufactures, render researches concerning them an object of interest to the public, and make it necessary that the Society should have the means of communicating with an institution, whose members and establishment are peculiarly fitted for obtaining and circulating useful information, relative to such researches. The Royal Institution, from the manner in which it is constituted, from the lectures which are delivered at its regular\nmeetings, from the knowledge of chemistry, theoretical as well as practical, possessed by many of its members, from the facilities which it affords for experiments and inquiries into every branch of science, from its valuable and extensive library, from the evening meetings which are held at its house every Friday, from the scientific character of the Society which attends these meetings, from the practical utility of the lectures which are delivered at them, and from the encouragement which is afforded to scientific men by Mr. Fuller, one of its most active and zealous supporters,* is evidently an institution which is well calculated for assisting the Royal Asiatic Society in researches of the nature which have been mentioned; and the Committee are happy to be able to report, that a communication has been opened between that Institution and the Society, which has been attended with great benefit to the Society owing to the zeal of Mr. Faraday, who is one of the most scientific chemists of the present time, and has frequently afforded the Committee the assistance of his talents, and profound knowledge of chemistry, in analysing and explaining to them the nature of the different combinations of metals and other substances which the Society have received from various persons in Asia, and which now form a part of the collection in their Museum.\n\nThe Medico-Botanical Society.\n\nThe immense extent and variety of the soil and climate of the British territories in India; the numbers and the varieties of the plants and other vegetable productions which are used either for food or medicine by the natives of the country; the facility which exists at present for the scientific investigation of their nature, their growth, and their medical properties, by means of the able and well-educated medical men who are stationed in every province; the interest which has been excited upon the subject by the works of Drs. Fleming, Roxburgh, and Ainslie; and the importance of such information to the British Government, with a view to the economy of their medical department and to the increase of the exports from their East-India colonies, have led the Committee to take measures for making collections of all the plants and vegetable productions which are used in every part of India, either as food or as medicine, for procuring accurate accounts of them from persons on the spot, for obtaining copies of every work written upon the subject in any European or Oriental language, and for opening a direct communication with the Medico-Botanical Society in England, through their President Sir James McGregor, who, from the high professional character which he enjoys, and the public office which he holds under the crown, has great influence both public and private, not only with all the members of his own Society and the medical men and botanists in Europe,\n\n* This gentleman has lately had a certain number of gold and copper medals struck, at his own expense, with the head of Lord Bacon on one side, and the name of the person to whom the medal is given on the other, for distribution amongst such of the members of that Society as are the most distinguished for science. These medals, which are executed by Mr. Wyon, are specimens of the great perfection to which that distinguished individual has arrived in his art.\nbut with every King's surgeon and assistant surgeon in Asia, who from the scientific nature of their education, and the admirable regulations which Sir James has made for their guidance, form a most efficient body for collecting upon the spot every information which the Royal Asiatic Society can require in this branch of their researches.\n\nMechanics' Institute.\n\nOne of the most important and most useful of the objects which the Society has in view, is the communication to the people of Asia of such of the modern improvements in machinery as may be applicable to their present situation. The surest method of attaining this object is to procure accurate models of the machinery in use in India, to make the knowledge of them as public as possible in England, and to induce all the great mechanical geniuses of the country to co-operate with the Society in the work in which they are engaged. The Committee have therefore taken measures, first, to procure from every part of Asia models of every machine which is used in that quarter of the globe, together with accurate descriptions of such models, a history of the different purposes for which they are employed, and a detailed account of the situation and circumstances of the country in which they are found, and of the religion, laws, manners, customs, character, and even prejudices of the people amongst whom they are used; secondly, to have the information they obtain respecting such machinery immediately published and circulated amongst those persons in England who are the most conversant with and interested in the subject; and, thirdly, to open an easy and rapid communication between the Society and the different Mechanics' Institutes in Great Britain, which are composed of the greatest number of the most distinguished mechanical geniuses that were ever collected together in any part of the world. What the Committee have done upon the first point may be seen by a reference to the models which are already deposited in the Museum, and to the descriptions which have been obtained from the India-House of those models which are deposited in the library of the East-India Company. What they have done upon the second point may be seen by a reference to the first volume of the Register of Arts, which the Committee beg leave to offer to the Society in the name of the editor, who has already entered with great readiness into their views upon this subject, and intends from time to time in his future volumes to devote a portion of his very valuable journal to descriptions and drawings of all such machines as are in use in India, having already given, to the public in the present volume, a description of the different machines that are in use in Ceylon, the models of which were brought to England by Sir Alexander Johnston in 1809, at the time he proposed to his Majesty's Government to adopt a measure relative to the state of machinery on that island, similar to the one which the Committee have now adopted with respect to the state of machinery in every part of Asia. What the Committee have done upon the third point, may be seen by a reference to the communications which have passed between Sir Alexander Johnston and Dr. Birkbeck, who is acquainted with the leading members of every Mechanics' Institute in England, and has promised that, as soon as he has obtained the necessary information, he will\nlay before the Committee a comparative view of the state of machinery in England and in India, and will point out to the Committee what portion of the improvements which have been made in the former, may, in his opinion, be introduced into the latter with advantage to the people of the country, and without militating in any way against their religion, laws, manners, customs, and prejudices.\n\nIN INDIA.\n\nThe Committee have opened a correspondence with the Governor-General, the three subordinate Governors of the Company's territories, the King's Governors of the Isle of France and Ceylon, the Asiatic Society of Calcutta, the Literary Societies of Bombay, Madras, and Ceylon, and with many distinguished literary characters in Asia; and have taken measures for establishing Committees of Correspondence at Calcutta, Madras, Bombay, Penang, Ceylon, and in the Isle of France, and for encouraging the natives of the country, as well as the civil and military servants of the Crown and the East-India Company, to become members of those committees. The communications which the Committee have recently received from India, shew the great advantage which the Society may derive from the civil and military servants of the East-India Company, and from the natives of India, as corresponding members of the Society. Captain Low has forwarded from Penang to the Society, a MS. copy of his English translation of the Siamese laws; a work which, from the insight it affords the public into the manners of the Siamese people, and into the customs of their country, is, considering the political and commercial relations which exist between Great Britain and the Burmese empire, of considerable importance, not only in a literary, but also in a political point of view. As the Committee know the active and laborious duties in which Captain Low was officially engaged under the Penang government, at the time he collected the Siamese laws, and translated them into English, they are fully aware of the value which ought to be attached to his zeal and perseverance in favour of literary researches; and hope that the aid which he will receive from the local government of Penang will enable him to extend his researches into the laws and literature of the Burmese, and adjoining nations, and to publish the valuable Grammar which he has prepared of the Siamese Language. Radhacant Deb, a native of rank and influence in Bengal, and a Vice-president of the Agricultural Society at Calcutta, has addressed from Calcutta a letter of which the annexed is a copy (see note 4), to Sir A. Johnston, as Chairman of the Committee of Correspondence. The subject to which the letter relates, the depth of thought it displays, and the English style in which it is written, do great credit to Radhacant Deb's talents and knowledge of the English language, and afford his countrymen a bright example for them to follow in cultivating their understandings, and becoming acquainted with the literature of Europe. The Committee therefore feel it their duty to submit, through their Chairman, to the Society, for\nconfirmation, the resolutions in favour of Captain Low and Radhacant Deb, of which the annexed are copies. (See note 5.)\n\nAlthough the Committee have turned their attention in general to all the subjects to which the views of the Society are directed, they have more particularly directed their inquiries to two subjects, the investigation of which is so much facilitated by the acquisition of territory which the British Government has made within the last twenty years. The one is, the history of those descendants of the Arab tribes, who profess different modifications of the Mahomedan religion, and are established along the whole of the sea-coast of India; the other, the history of the numerous nations who profess different modifications of the Buddha religion, and are established in the North and East of Asia, and on the island of Ceylon.\n\nThe first of these subjects embraces the history of the descendants of those Arabs who, either from a desire of trade or of propagating their religion, have from time to time, during the last ten centuries of the Christian era, formed establishments on the eastern coast of Africa, from Babelmandel to Mozambique; on the Comoro Islands; on the north-west coast of Madagascar; on the whole west, south, and east coast of the peninsula of India, from the Gulph of Cambay on one side, to the mouths of the river Ganges on the other; on the sea-coast of the whole circumference of Ceylon; on the Laccadive and Maldive Islands; on the north coast of Sumatra, and on many other islands in the Indian seas. These people retain the Arab features of their ancestors, and profess the Mahomedan religion, although they have in many instances adopted the language and some of the customs of the several nations amongst whom they reside. They in general are small capitalists, and carry on the retail trade of the country; they are, however, sometimes very large capitalists, very extensive merchants, very great proprietors of ships, and are very actively engaged in extensive commercial speculations between their respective countries and every part of India, Persia, and Arabia. A few of them are skilful navigators; many of them are the best practical sailors of all the different natives of Asia who navigate the Indian seas; and most of them have a set of maritime and commercial usages, according to which, disputes between themselves relative to maritime and commercial questions are decided by arbitrators of their own class and religious persuasion.\n\nThe Committee look for information, with respect to such of these people as inhabit the sea-coast of the peninsula of India, of the island of Ceylon, and of the Laccadive and Maldive Islands, from the King's and East-India Company's civil and military servants who are in authority in the neighbourhood of those coasts; and with respect to such of them as inhabit the eastern coasts of Africa,* the Comoro Islands,\n\n* Captain Owen, the brother of Sir Edward Owen, the present Commander-in-chief of the naval forces in India, collected during the survey which he some time ago made of the whole of the eastern coast of Africa, from Babelmandel north to Mozambique south, many very valuable memoirs relative to the different Mahomedan nations who have settlements along that coast. Captain Owen with the greatest liberality\nand Madagascar, from Sir Charles Colville,* the governor of the Isle of France, and from many of the French inhabitants of that island. These Colonists have for a series of years evinced a strong feeling in favour of intellectual improvement, and researches into every branch of knowledge, literature, and natural history, by keeping up, both while they were under the French, and since they have been under the British Government, one of the best colleges for the education of their youth, and one of the best botanical gardens for the rearing of foreign plants, which are to be met with in any of the British possessions to the East of the Cape of Good Hope; and are inhabitants of an island, the name of which is associated in the history of the politics, the wars, the trade, the navigation, and the botany of India, with the distinguished names of La Bourdonnais, Dupleix, De Poivre, Commer\u00e7on, Gentil, Sonnerat, Flacourt, and Rochon; and the geographical situation of which is peculiarly well adapted for researches relative to the state of those descendants of the Arabs who are settled on the eastern coast of Africa and the African islands, and who, from deriving their origin from the same race of people, from professing the same religion, and carrying on the same description of trade as those Mahomedans who are settled along the coast of Asia, bear so much resemblance to them, as to render any information relative to the history of the one, very useful in elucidating the history of the other.\n\nThe second of the subjects to which the Committee have adverted embraces the history of those people who profess the principles of the Buddha religion in Tartary, Thibet, Nepaul, the Burmese and Siamese territories, Cambodia, Laos, China, Cochin China, Japan, and the island of Ceylon. The Committee look for information, with respect to such of them as inhabit Tartary, China, Cochin China, and Japan, from the Russian University at Casan, the Russian College at Pekin, and from the Chinese libraries of Sir George Staunton\u2020 and Dr. Morrison; and\n\nsent, previous to his departure for Fernando Po, the whole of these memoirs to Sir Alex. Johnston, in order that he might peruse them and communicate to the Royal Asiatic Society any part of the information they contained which he might think proper.\n\n* Sir Charles Colville, while Commander-in-chief at Bombay, made a tour through different parts of India, and became thoroughly acquainted with the local peculiarities and the native inhabitants of the country. Mrs. Blair, the lady of Colonel Blair, Sir Charles's Military Secretary, who accompanied the Colonel on his tour, has taken very beautiful drawings of many of the places which she visited. As these drawings give an accurate view of some of the most classical and remarkable places which are mentioned in the history of India, it is to be hoped, for the benefit of all those who are interested in oriental history and oriental researches, that Mrs. Blair may be induced to allow them to be published.\n\n\u2020 Sir George Staunton, both while he held a high office in the service of the East-India Company and while he acted as one of his Majesty's Commissioners in China, shewed the possibility of uniting the strictest attention to the duties of a public office with the most ardent zeal for acquiring a knowledge of the language and literature of the Chinese, and made, during his residence in China, the large and valuable collection of Chinese books (consisting of 2,600 vols.) which he some time ago presented to the Royal Asiatic Society. As Mr. Huttman, the Secretary to this Committee, has acquired a very accurate knowledge of the Chinese language and literature, it is hoped he will have leisure, with the assistance of Sir George, to translate into English some of the most valuable of these works.\nwith respect to such of them as inhabit the Burmese and Siamese territories, Laos, and Cambodia, from Mr. Fullerton, the Governor of Penang, Captain Low, and the different civil and military servants and Christian missionaries who are established along the coast of Tenasserim, at Penang, Malacca, and Singapore. Thibet is, to the people of the Buddha religion in the North, what Ceylon is to those in the South of Asia\u2014the place to which they refer for authentic knowledge relative to that particular modification of the Buddha religion which they profess. The Committee, therefore, look for information, with respect to the doctrines of that form of it which prevails in Thibet and the Nepaul country, from Mr. Gardner, the Political Resident in Nepaul, and Mr. Hodgson, his very able assistant; and with respect to the doctrines of the same religion which prevail on the island of Ceylon, from the English translations of several Pali, Singalese, and Dutch manuscripts, which were made by order of Sir Alexander Johnston,* while President of his Majesty's Council on Ceylon, from the several civil and military servants and Christian missionaries on that island, and more particularly from the Dutch and native inhabitants of the country, who, judging from the intellectual activity and local knowledge which they have invariably displayed in the exercise of those political privileges with which they have been invested by his present Majesty since 1811, are highly qualified, if properly encouraged, for making researches into the history and antiquities of their country, and procuring for the Society such information as may be derived from the numerous Pali and Cingalese works,\u2020 which are preserved by\n\n* These consist of:\u2014\n\nFirst. The English translations of the answers given in Cingalese by several of the most learned of the Buddha priests and other literary characters on Ceylon, to questions which were officially submitted to them by Sir Alex. Johnston, while president of his Majesty's Council in Ceylon, relative to the history and doctrine of the Buddha religion as professed by the followers of Buddha on that island.\n\nSecondly. English translations of the Cingalese works called the Mahavansie, the Rajah Valle, and the Rajah Ratnakari, which were reported to Sir Alex. Johnston by the Buddha priests, whom he had officially consulted upon the subject, to be in their opinion the most authentic histories which they possessed of their religion and their country from the earliest times to the beginning of the sixteenth century.\n\nThirdly. The English translation of the whole of that volume of Valentyn's history of the Dutch possessions in India which relates to the island of Ceylon.\n\nFourthly. English translations of a great many papers written by several Dutch inhabitants of Ceylon in Dutch at different times during the whole of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries relative to the history of the Buddha religion and the people of Ceylon.\n\nAll the translations from the Cingalese and Pali languages into English were either made or revised by the late Rajah Paxie, who was one of the best Sanscrit, Pali, and Cingalese scholars amongst the natives of Ceylon, and held for a great many years the office of Maha-Modliar, or chief of the cinnamon department on that island. He was the native chief of whom Sir Alex. Johnston has presented an engraving to the Society.\n\n\u2020 Some of these books relate to the systems of astronomy, astrology, geography, cosmography, and medicine, which prevail among the people of Ceylon, but most of them to the history and doctrine of\nthe priests of the Buddha religion in many of the Buddha temples that are situated in the interior and the southern division of the island. The Committee consider it to be a most fortunate circumstance for the Society in particular, and for the cause of Oriental literature in general, that their researches in Ceylon will be assisted and directed by Colonel Colebrooke, a near relative of the learned Director of the Society, and a Parliamentary Commissioner on that island, who is one of the original founders of the Society, and who, during many years of his civil and military career, in different parts of India and Java, has eminently distinguished himself, as well by the knowledge he acquired of the people and the countries of Asia, as by the humanity, liberality, and philanthropy with which his public measures and private conduct were marked, in every civil and military office which he has held, either under the Crown or the East-India Company.\n\nON THE CONTINENT OF EUROPE.\n\nSome sovereigns on the continent of Europe have for centuries encouraged amongst their subjects the study of the languages, the history, the geography, the antiquities, and the literature of Asia; have established professorships of Oriental literature at their respective universities, and have sent, at a considerable expense, many of the most distinguished men in the country, to different parts of the world, for the express purpose of prosecuting Oriental researches, and collecting for the public libraries of their respective nations scarce and valuable works, in all the different languages of the East. Other sovereigns of Europe, though from the political changes which have taken place in their respective countries, they do not at present feel so great an interest as they formerly did in the subject, yet have nevertheless preserved with care, as well amongst the public archives of the country, as in their public and private libraries, valuable information, in manuscript and in print, relative to the state and the people of India during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.\n\nRussia, from the extent of Northern Asia, which is directly under her dominion,\n\nthe Buddha religion. Sir Alex. Johnston, in consequence of the official intercourse which he always kept up with the principal Buddha priests on the island of Ceylon, obtained from them in 1808 the very detailed catalogue of these works which he some time ago gave to the Society.\n\nHe had also in 1808 copies made of between five and six hundred of the most valuable of these works, all of which were unfortunately lost in the Lady Jane Dundas, in which he had sent them to England in 1809. As the originals are an object of literary curiosity he is about to have other copies of them made on the island of Ceylon, which he means as soon as he can procure them to present to the Society.\n\nThe only work of the whole collection which he preserved is a complete copy of the Pansiyapayenasjatakaya, which he brought home with him in 1818, and which he has given to the library of the Society. As a complete copy of this work is the most difficult to be procured of any of the works on the Buddha religion, and as it contains the most authentic account of the whole of the doctrines of that religion, Sir Alexander has taken measures to have an English translation made of it for the use of the Society.\nfrom the intercourse which she keeps up with the whole of Tartary and with the northern provinces of China, from the Asiatic descent of a considerable portion of her subjects, from the various Oriental languages which are spoken by them, and from the different modifications of the Buddha and Mahommedan religions which influence their moral and religious opinions, has not only an interest in all literary researches which relate to the northern and eastern parts of Asia, but is enabled, from her local situation and the nature of her government, to carry them on at less expense, and with more success, than any other nation in Europe. Catharine II., while in the plentitude of her power, from a desire to promote, by her influence, every object of science and literature, and to ascertain upon a more extensive plan than was ever attempted before, the analogies and affinities of all the languages of the world, procured, through the late Professor Pallas, in answer to instructions drawn up by herself, under the advice of the ablest and most profound philosophers and philologists of the age, very minute and authentic information relative to the different languages, dialects, and idioms, which were either spoken or known in any part of her immense dominions. The only portion of this information which is still incomplete, is that which relates to the numerous languages which prevail in those divisions of Asia which are at present either under the government or the influence of Great Britain.\n\nThe Royal Asiatic Society, through the civil and military servants of the East-India Company, and the Christian missionaries who are established in every part of India, and who have acquired a knowledge of the various languages which are spoken throughout the British territories, possess at this moment a facility which no other society enjoys, for completing, in as far as it relates to the south of Asia, the grand and enlightened plan which was originally commenced and carried into effect by Catharine II., in as far as it relates to the north and east of Asia. The Committee of Correspondence have therefore opened a communication upon this subject, through Prince Lieven, with the present Emperor of Russia, and are happy to report, that his Imperial Majesty has, through the Prince, as appears by the Prince's letters to Sir Alex. Johnston, not only agreed to assist the Society in the attainment of its objects generally, but has also been graciously pleased to present to it copies of all the works relative to the different languages of Russia, which were compiled under the orders of Catharine II., and were printed by her Imperial Majesty for private circulation.\n\nGermany has of late years evinced the greatest zeal in procuring information from every quarter of the globe, relative to the history, the literature, and the sciences of Asia. Austria has an Oriental academy at Vienna, and may be of considerable use to Oriental researches, by means of the Oriental manuscripts which she possesses in the libraries of Vienna, Milan, and Venice, and by the patronage which she may afford to a continuation of Von Hammer's celebrated work, the \"Fundgruben des Orients.\" Prussia has shewn herself a friend to Oriental literature, by the encouragement which she has given to Professors Bopp and Rosen; by the liberality with\nwhich she has promoted the study of Sanscrit at the University of Bonn; by the appointment to that University of A. W. Von Schlegel, who is one of the best Sanscrit scholars of the present age; and finally, by the high respect which she shews to Baron Wm. Humboldt, whose philosophical inquiries into the grammatical construction of Oriental languages, has at once proved the extent of his philosophical genius and the value of his philological inquiries. Bavaria, by the choice which she has made of Dr. R\u00fcckert for the Oriental Professorship at the University of Erlangen, by the disinterested manner in which she has enabled Professors Bopp and Frank to carry on their Oriental studies in France and in England, and to complete their Sanscrit grammars, has conferred a benefit on those who make a study of Oriental literature.\n\nHolland, by having established at Batavia the first literary society that was ever formed in Asia, for investigating the literature and science of that part of the globe, by having encouraged the works on botany and natural history of Van Rheede, Burman, Linn\u00e6us,* and Rumphius; by having patronized and assisted with the whole influence of her government, Valentyn's valuable history of the Dutch East-India possessions, is entitled to the very first place amongst those nations who have promoted the acquisition of knowledge relative to Asia.\n\nPortugal, from having been the first European power which ever had any permanent establishments in India, possesses amongst her records many valuable memoirs relative to the state of the people of that country, during a great part if not the whole of the sixteenth century.\n\nSpain, from having been so long the seat of the Mohammedan kingdoms of Seville and Cordova, at a time when those kingdoms were famed for the encouragement which they gave to every branch of literature, contains in her public and private libraries valuable information relative to all those branches of literature and science which were known by the Mohammedans in Spain, and at Bagdad during the most remarkable period of their history, and which are intimately connected with the different branches of literature and science which still prevail throughout many parts of Asia.\n\nRome, from being the seat of the College of the Propaganda, and the depository of the reports which were made by the Jesuit, and all the other Catholic Missionaries in India, during the 15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, affords much information relative to the people of India which cannot be procured from any other source in Europe or Asia. France, from the very early encouragement which she gave to the study of Oriental literature; from the value and the number of the Oriental works in her libraries; from her early intercourse with Siam; from the able men she has had in her different factories in Asia Minor; from the researches made by La Bourdonnais and Dupleix, into every branch of the trade and politics of India; from the works of Commer\u00e7on, Lechenaade de la Tour, and Gentil, on the science\n\n* Linn\u00e6us, besides his other great works on natural history, wrote the Flora Zexylanica.\nand natural history of India and the Indian seas; from the knowledge acquired by the French Institute, while in Egypt, relative to that country and its connection with Asia; and finally, from her having established at Paris a society, whose sole object is to carry on researches relative to the literature and science of Asia, must be considered as one of the most able and efficient coadjutors, which the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland can have, in prosecuting the researches for which it was instituted.\n\nFor these reasons, the Committee have already opened a communication with some of the governments, and with many of the most distinguished characters on the continent of Europe; and have received from all of them the most encouraging assurances of co-operation and literary assistance. Monsieur Falck,* Baron B\u00fclow, Count Ludolf, Count Moltke, and Baron Cetto, the Ministers at the British Court, from the Netherlands, Prussia, Naples, Denmark, and Bavaria, will procure for the Society an accurate account of all the collections of Oriental manuscripts in Prussia, Naples, Rome, Denmark, Bavaria, the Netherlands, the archives of the late Dutch East-India Company, the island of Java, and all the Dutch possessions in Asia. Count Funchal, the Minister of Portugal at Rome, will draw up for the Society a pr\u00e9cis of all the information which the Portuguese possess relative to Asia; and Lord Stuart de Rothsay, the English Ambassador at Rome, will, as soon as his Portuguese manuscripts are arranged, allow the Committee to look over such of them as relate to the different Portuguese settlements in the East-Indies.\n\nWith respect to France, the Committee beg leave to report, that they have on every occasion received the most ready, and most material assistance from Prince Polignac, the French ambassador at this Court; and that they feel it their duty, in referring the Society to the letter, of which the annexed is a translation (See Note 6), from Mons. Abel Remusat to Sir Alexander Johnston, most particularly to call the attention of the Society to the very cordial and friendly manner in which the Duke of Orleans, as President of the Asiatic Society at Paris, and all the Members of that Society, received the communication which Sir Alexander Johnston made to them upon the subject of Mr. Daniell's proposal to publish, under the patronage of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, his very valuable collection of drawings of different parts of India.\n\n* Monsieur Falck is descended from a family whose services in India have been productive of the greatest benefit to the Dutch East-India possessions, and is a cousin of the late Dutch Governor of the Island of Ceylon, William Emanuel Falck, whose name is still revered on that island, and is invariably associated in the minds of the natives of the country with the idea of the most impartial justice and the purest integrity. Sir Alexander Johnston, out of respect to the memory of this great man, has presented to the Royal Asiatic Society a very interesting drawing, in which Governor Falck is represented as signing, in the presence of his Council and the Candian ambassadors, the treaty of 1706, by which the King of Candia ceded to the Dutch East-India Company the whole circumference of the island of Ceylon, the acquisition of which had been the principal object of their policy from the time they first got possession of that island.\nThe Committee also beg leave to report that they have, in carrying on their foreign communications with different persons and governments on the continent of Europe, derived great assistance from many foreigners who are members of the Committee, and that they have therefore, with their permission, appointed three of them to be their foreign Secretaries: Dr. Rosen, the pupil of the celebrated Professor Bopp at Berlin, and Professor of Oriental languages at the London University, to be their Sanscrit and German Secretary; Dr. Dorn, a distinguished Persian and Arabic scholar, to be their Persian and Arabic Secretary; and Monsieur C\u00e6sar Moreau, the French Vice Consul in England, and the author of many valuable works on the Statistics and Commerce of Great Britain and France, to be their French Secretary.\n\nThe Committee have taken measures for procuring detailed accounts of the different articles of which the collection in the Museum of the Society is composed; and they have reason to hope that several persons, who are well acquainted with the nature of those articles, will soon lay before the Society such descriptions of them, as may enable the public to derive much information from the Museum, relative to those parts of Oriental history to which the Society have directed their inquiries.\n\n---\n\n**NOTES**\n\n**NOTE 1.**\n\n*Copy of a Letter from the Rev. Professor Lee to Sir Alexander Johnston, Knt.*\n\nLondon, April 17, 1827.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI now proceed to lay before you a more detailed account of what I believe ought to be done, and what, I think, the Royal Asiatic Society can do, towards improving the state of Oriental literature in this country. But, perhaps, it will be best to state, in the first place, the situation in which we now are, and then to proceed to suggest the remedy. I shall be particular on the Arabic and Persic only, because the detail would be too long to do so in every case; and I shall begin with the Arabic. In this department, then, a tolerable grammar has never yet made its appearance in this country. The work of Richardson is meagre in the extreme, and better calculated to set the learner out wrong, and to keep him so, than to benefit him in acquiring the Arabic language. The admirable works of Colonel Baillie and Mr. Lumsden are unfinished, and likely to remain so. In this case the learner must have recourse either to the *Grammaire Arabe* of M. de Sacy, or to one of the grammars published in Latin by the Catholic missionaries; in the latter of which, however, he will have the mortification to find very great defects, and, in some cases, views on the subject quite foreign to the genius of that language. M. de Sacy has supplied many of the deficiencies, and corrected many of the errors of preceding writers on Arabic grammar, but valuable as his work is, it leaves something to be desired through the omission of the prosody, and his paradigm of the verb does not quite agree with the views of the Arabian grammarians. In the Latin grammar of Guadagnoli, indeed, a prosody is to be found, but this is full of mistakes, as Clarke has shewn. If he have recourse to the work of Mr. Gladwin on this subject, he will here find endless difficulties. The only work of much value on this subject, is the little book published by Clarke at Oxford,\nAPPENDIX.\n\nabout 150 years ago. But this requires the greatest stretch of attention to understand the rules, and of principles, nothing is said. It is surely much to be regretted, that we have no good elementary work of this kind in English; and still more so to find that there is not the least prospect of having one, until some step be taken, either by the Royal Asiatic Society, or some other body capable of bearing the expenses incident to such an undertaking.\n\nIn the next place, what have we in lexicography? If we except the lexicons of Golius and Castell, we have nothing we can recommend as a general dictionary. Wilmet, indeed, has compiled a very useful work for a few particular books; but then that work is scarce, not to insist on its uselessness in a general way. But this objection will go in a great degree against the lexicons of Golius, Castell, the Kamoos, and the Soorah; for in these we find scarcely one of the terms of art, without which hardly a single book in Arabic can be made out. Were it necessary here to go into the detail, I could shew, that scarcely a translator is to be named, from Pococke down to the present day, who has not had his labour greatly increased through the omission of technical terms in those dictionaries. This remark extends to every science, to works on theology, and even to the commonest expressions in use among the Arabians. Again, let a man take any book of poetry, or of proverbial expressions, such as the work of Meidani, and try his hand with any of the dictionaries just mentioned. I have no doubt he will make out a sense; but, very likely, a sense quite different from that intended by the author. If Meninski is substituted for these lexicographers, then I believe he would find himself infinitely more bewildered. Here we have nothing to point out the construction of the verbs, the several conjugations in which they are found, or the senses they bear in these conjugations. Many of the words are erroneously explained: and in every case we have a \"rudis indigestaque moles.\" Dr. Wilkins's edition of Richardson's Persian and Arabic dictionary is a very great improvement of that work, but I venture to suggest it would be best to have separate dictionaries of each. That few should be found to understand the Arabic and Persic, with helps like these, is certainly not to be wondered at; the wonder is, how any thing has been made out. The French and German literati have felt this in all its weight, and have very properly betaken themselves to the scholiasts and vocabularies containing the terms of art, and to the native grammarians and commentators on grammar, and hence have found, what they could find nowhere else, their progress to be solid and delightful.\n\nIn the next place, what can we be said to know of Oriental history, I mean Arabic and Persian, if we except the works of Pococke, Reiske and a few others? In the Persian, not so much as one historian has yet been printed or translated: and yet our libraries abound with the most valuable works, reserved only for worms' meat, or to go back into their native element the dust! The histories of Persia, its dynasties and wars, of Hindustan, of Tartary, and other adjacent countries, are shewn in our libraries, just as \"our rarer monsters are,\" merely to excite the surprise of the ignorant.\n\nThen, of Arabian and Persian poetry, and the belles-lettres, how much do we know? We have, indeed, a few elegant extracts printed at Calcutta, for which the Honourable East-India Company deserves the thanks of the country,* but how are they to be made out? Will any one attempt to make out the\n\n* It is not meant to be averred, that great praise is not due to the Honourable East India Company, for the great patronage and support which they have afforded to Oriental literature. To their servants, Europe is entirely indebted for a knowledge of the Sanscrit, and for the publication of many valuable works in that language\u2014for a splendid and accurate edition of the Kamoos, the Soorah, the Burh\u0101n\u012b K\u0101tia, the five books on Arabic grammar the Sharho Molla J\u0101mi, a valuable edition of the works of S\u0101di, the Life of Timour, the Mak\u0101mat of H\u0101uri, the Hid\u0101ya, with an English translation, the Deew\u0101ni \u1e24\u0101niz, the Dabist\u0101ni Madh\u0101hib, the valuable Persian selections, forming the Class-books of the College of Fort William\u2014all that is known of the Hindust\u0101ni, a splendid and valuable Chinese Dictionary and Grammar, and the translations of some books of History, Tales, and Poetry, with a great variety of other works, in almost every department.\nDeewan of Motanabbi, or of Kh\u00e1jah H\u00e1fiz, with the assistance of the dictionaries of Golius, &c.? If he does, I will only say, he will attempt to do that, in which no one ever yet did, or ever shall, succeed; and of this, after a short trial, I think he will be perfectly convinced. If he means to do anything likely to satisfy himself, or to benefit mankind, he must recur to the native commentaries, or, which is nearly the same thing, he must have a learned native at his elbow. But suppose an individual hardy enough to get through all these difficulties, and to publish the result of his labours for the benefit of others; suppose him to have laboured for years, to translate some valuable and interesting work, and then suppose him to print it for the benefit of mankind: what must now be his mortification to find, that he can perhaps sell six copies; and that he must labour for years to pay the debts he has contracted in printing and publishing his book? If a man will suppose this, he will suppose nothing more than has more than once taken place, and which will perhaps induce him to believe, that few individuals will ever think of labouring to this extent, and fewer still of giving to the world the result of their labours.\n\nWhat has here been stated with reference to Arabian and Persian literature few will perhaps undertake to deny; and if so, when we consider our connections with the East, particularly in a mercantile point of view, I think all must be convinced, that there exists a necessity, that something should be done on a more liberal scale than has hitherto been attempted. I will now point out a list of works that may be printed or translated, or both, with a view to meet the deficiencies just noticed, not intending to intimate that others equally valuable may not also be mentioned, but only to shew that these difficulties need not necessarily exist.\n\n**Arabic Grammar.**\n\nIbn ul H\u00e1jeb, with the Commentary of Moola Jami, and of Najmodden of Irak\n\nThe \u00c1lfia of Ibn M\u00e1l\u00edk\u2014Ibn Farhat, &c.\n\nThe Mozhir ul Lughat, by Soyuti.

It was suggested by my correspondent, in the Cambridge paper of March 16,\u2020 that needy Arabs and Persians may probably be employed in furthering the progress of such works. I believe this is practicable, for the following reasons.\n\nThere is in Persia at this time a predilection so strong in favour of English literature, that, I believe, a dozen learned men, if they were wanted, might be easily induced to come and settle in this country, at least for a time. This has been exemplified in the case of the Mirza Ibrahim, who is now at Haileybury; for, to my certain knowledge, he came here without the least prospect of wealth whatever, and expressed his willingness, when he joined me at Cambridge, to give his labour for a considerable time on the most liberal terms. But, as this was more than I could promise him, and as the East-India Company expressed a wish to have him at their College, I was content to part with him, and he accepted of a salary of \u00a3200 a year, with lodging, &c. for the first year, which was to be a year of trial; I have no doubt, therefore, that others would be induced to come over on terms equally easy. Now, as to the Arabs, I believe the same may be done. I myself have had letters from learned Arabs, both in Egypt and Palestine, soliciting employment; and one of these persons, I have reason to believe, has since been employed in the capacity of a translator and teacher. I believe, therefore, that there would be no want of help from these quarters, and these would be sufficient perhaps to make the trial upon.\n\nIn reducing this to practice, I should certainly advise to begin on a small scale. In the first case, perhaps, no one need be sent for. The Mirza Ibrahim, I have no doubt, would be willing to occupy his vacations, and vacant time during the period of lectures, in conjunction with an Orientalist, in some work of this description; and, indeed, I have heard him say, that it is his wish to do so. If then the Society thought it worth while to make the experiment on a small scale, perhaps this would be an advisable plan; and, in this case, one of the Professors at Haileybury, &c. may be associated with him. If they should wish also to try the Arabic, no doubt Mr. Salt would engage a Moollah for a short time, and at a reasonable rate, who may be associated with some gentleman, in London or elsewhere, to superintend such work. Perhaps a person acquainted with English might be engaged; but, if not, that is of little consequence, the parties would soon be able to understand one another. In this event, I think the Universities would not be unwilling to assist in the article of printing, as they have certain privileges in this respect not possessed by others. I certainly would do all in my power to do the needful at Cambridge; and I have\n\n* Col. Briggs's translation of this work is now in the press.\n\u2020 This correspondence follows this letter.\nreason to believe, that there is a feeling there in favour of this project; and Oxford would probably join.\n\nI hope it will not be thought that I have any wish to make myself important in this business. I only wish to see something done; and shall be most willing to further any project likely to do so, as far as my slender means and abilities will go. Much I cannot promise; but the little I can do shall be done cheerfully.\n\nI have the honour to be, dear Sir,\n\nYour's very faithfully,\n\nSAMUEL LEE.\n\nCorrespondence referred to in the preceding Letter. (From the Cambridge Chronicle, March 16, 1827.)\n\nTo the Rev. Professor Lee.\n\nSir: The influence which you possess in the community of letters, not only from your distinguished situation among a body itself highly eminent for talent and enlightenment, but also from your own personal attainments, point you out to me as the person, above all others, to whom I would publicly address a few thoughts on the present state of Oriental learning.\n\nYou are well aware that the literature of the East is of great extent and great value; that the treasures which have been hitherto explored have furnished us with specimens of the most polished and elevated poetry, and the most ingenious and beautiful fiction; with much that is valuable and single in history, and much in science that even now is curious and useful; nor, in the present state of scientific improvement, are we to forget that we derived from the East those extensive and generalized principles of calculation which have conducted to the proudest triumphs of philosophy. Yet it is no less certain that the great field of Hindoo, Persian, Arabic, and Chinese literature, has been very imperfectly explored. Even the libraries of Europe, especially those of Spain, comprise a far greater number of Oriental MSS. than have ever been studied; or, at least, communicated to the literary world. But these again are a mere speck, in comparison with the vast treasures of the East itself. Amidst all these MSS., many, doubtless, are of little intrinsic worth; but it still will remain certain that an immense ocean of knowledge is floating around us, which, like the waters which eluded the grasp of Tantalus, is for ever escaping our thirst. And what may not this knowledge be? Details on the population of the ancient world; particulars of those nations with whom the Greeks acquaint us incorrectly; and the Hebrews imperfectly; and translations of the lost Greek and Roman authors, which we know the Arabians of Europe frequently made. The entire history of Livy is, perhaps, latent in some European library, among the neglected and perishing treasures of Eastern knowledge. The theory of Egyptian hieroglyphics, in illustrating which the most logical and discriminating minds have hitherto laboured with small, though wonderful success, is perhaps placed beyond the province of conjecture in some Arabian or Ethiopian treatise.\n\nThat such probabilities should not have been fathomed, seems a reproach to the literary world, but most of all to this country, whose power and possessions in the East are so considerable, and whose learning and opportunities point her out as the most effective instrument in promoting the great result. But it may be said, what can she do? Has she not her colleges and her professors, both here and in India; and is not the work itself proceeding, although with a slowness proportioned to its extent? But the labourers are too few, nor are they of the class required. Dr. Wait, I am told, is now making a descriptive catalogue of the Oriental MSS. in the University library; his fine talents are employed in an object of the highest use. But what if this object be attainable with equal certainty, greater celerity, and the expenditure of less valuable time than that of such a scholar as Dr. Wait? What if the attainment of this object depended not on the will and taste of individuals, but be made the subject of a system which will compel its end? What if its promotion be not confined to the walls of an university, but extend through the whole of the British possessions?\nThe method to which I invite your notice carries with it a better authority than my own. It was recommended by Bishop Watson forty years ago, and it is astonishing that it has excited so little attention. \"It is a work,\" says he, \"worthy of the attention of all the universities in Europe, to undertake the translation of the Oriental MSS. which we are at present possessed of. Men skilled in these languages should be invited from every quarter, formed into a kind of society, and employed for life, under the direction of proper persons, in the drudgery of translation. Nothing worthy of notice in this way can be expected from the detached labours of a few professors of Hebrew or Arabic; men of liberal education cannot readily be brought to undertake such a task, and, if they could, the matter may be effected at a much easier expense by the labours of inferior persons. What would be an adequate reward for three or four needy Turks or Persians, would not be a proper stipend for one man of letters, who should be obliged annually to produce the fruits of his unremitting diligence.\" But, without entering into the particular manner of accomplishing this design, I cannot help being of opinion, that an institution established at Cambridge for the express purpose of translating and publishing Oriental MSS. would redound to the credit of the University, and tend to put the learned world in possession of a very valuable part of literature, of which, at present, we have but a very imperfect knowledge.\n\nI shall not presume to suggest methods where the learned Bishop has been silent, but sure I am that the subject is well worthy mature consideration; and, effectively pursued, it would do honour to yourself, the University, the country, and even to the civilized world.\n\nI remain, Sir, your most obedient servant,\n\nA Member of the Senate.\n\nTo the Editor of the Cambridge Chronicle.\n\nSir: Having had the honour of being addressed by \"A Member of the Senate,\" in your paper of the 16th instant, as to the means whereby the treasures, now hidden in our Oriental manuscripts, might be more generally made known among us, you will oblige me by allowing the following reply to appear in your next.\n\nIn the first place, then, I concur entirely with the opinions of this gentleman, that to bring to light these treasures could not but tend considerably to advance our knowledge on subjects of the greatest interest and moment, and that to devise some plan by which this could be effected, would be \"a consummation devoutly to be wished.\"\n\nIt has been truly said by him, that the library of the Escurial contains vast treasures of this kind. I answer, our own library, since the acquisition of the MSS. of the late Mr. Burckhardt, and of several purchases made since his death\u2014that of the British Museum, since the purchase of the valuable collection made by the late Mr. Rich\u2014that of the Bodleian of Oxford, to which may be added a most valuable and extensive collection at the India House, present stores, perhaps, sufficiently extensive to satisfy the most sanguine inquirer on subjects of this kind. But, if not, access is to be had to the almost endless stores of the Vatican, the Imperial Library of Vienna, and the Royal Library of Paris; not to insist on the daily accessions made to our libraries by the importation of MSS. from the East.\n\nThat the resources are abundant, therefore, I think there can be no doubt, and that to bring their contents to light is desirable, perhaps there cannot be more than one opinion. But I may be allowed to say, that it is not to science only, or general information, that the most interesting accessions may be thus made; our knowledge of the Hebrew Scriptures could not but be greatly advanced. The grammar, rhetoric, laws, customs, and manners of the Orientals contribute, as all allow, in an astonishing degree, towards elucidating the phraseology of the Bible; and, I am sure, it cannot be necessary here to shew that these means have never yet been drawn upon to anything like the extent of their resources.\n\nAgain: from a collation and classification of all the Syriac MSS. found in this country, particularly\nAPPENDIX.\n\nthose preserved in Mr. Rich's collection,* our knowledge of Biblical criticism could not but be greatly advanced. But where, it may be asked, are we to look for an individual who can command time and funds necessary for such a work? Or, where for a market, provided it could be completed, likely to make returns sufficient to pay the printer? The voice of fame only is, I fear, much too languid to call forth adventurers of this kind; and this is perhaps, all that can be reasonably expected from labours such as these.\n\nThat such a consummation cannot be effected by the solitary labours of the Oriental professors in the Universities, the Member of the Senate has justly remarked. The public is, indeed, highly indebted to such men as Pococke, Hyde, Walton, and others, who have distinguished themselves in this career. But generally, official duties, the want of funds, and a bad market, will always be sufficient to present insurmountable obstacles to speculations of this kind. I believe, nevertheless, that something may be devised whereby these difficulties might be removed, and the interests of all likely to advance such an object, be effectually united. In the constitution of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, I think, we can find all the necessary requisites. We have, in this institution, the King for a patron, the President of the Board of Control for a president, the learned and indefatigable Mr. Colebrooke for a director, and for a body, men the most distinguished for their learning, candour, and talents, in this kingdom. I have reason to believe, that there is a feeling favourable to such a project as this, both in the Government and at the India House. Mr. Wynn, I understand, is anxious to do something towards advancing Oriental literature; and some of the Directors of the East-India Company have expressed a similar feeling. If, therefore, something feasible could be devised, there is reason to hope that funds would not be wanting.\n\nIn the next place, as the Member of the Senate has justly remarked, needy Arabs and Persians may be obtained from the East, and these, in conjunction with the professors of the Universities, or other Orientalists, whom a select committee of that Society might think proper to employ, would afford the best pledges that such works would be well chosen and correctly executed. The Universities, moreover, may not be averse to assist in the article of printing, which, I think, is probable, when works, recommended as these would be, were brought before them. And, again, as the Society above-mentioned is at present relying on the gratuitous assistance of its members for articles to compose the volumes of its Transactions, it is not improbable they may be disposed to listen to some such project as this.\n\nI will add one consideration more, which is this. It must, I think, appear surprising, that a country like this, having such extensive and daily extending intercourse with the East, both in a religious and commercial point of view, should evince so little interest on a subject of such importance as the cultivation of Oriental literature; while on the Continent, there is not only a general interest excited and maintained, far beyond anything witnessed in former times, but also the patronage of the several governments is actually afforded, for what, in their case, can amount to little more than the gratification of a literary curiosity.\n\nI can only say, in conclusion, that it is my intention to lay this correspondence before one of the Vice-Presidents of the Royal Asiatic Society, with whom I have the honour of being acquainted, and should anything eventually grow out of it, the public will have to thank the Member of the Senate for his communication.\n\nI am, Sir, your obliged humble servant,\n\nSamuel Lee.\n\n* Some of these MSS. are upwards of 1,000 years old, and others present most valuable portions of the Philoxenian or Nestorian, exemplars. I myself have made considerable progress in such a collation; but having already burnt my fingers in speculations of this kind, I am not over anxious to try the experiment again.\nNOTE 2.\n\nRoyal Asiatic Society's House,\n14, Grafton Street, Bond Street,\nOctober 20, 1827.\n\nTo the Honourable the Chairman, Deputy Chairman, and Court of Directors of the United East-India Company.\n\nHonourable Sirs: As your Honourable Court has ever been forward in promoting the interests of that extensive empire over which you preside, by the patronage of oriental literature, we beg leave to represent to your Honourable Court, that the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland has resolved, with the assistance of such of its members as are eminent for their knowledge of Asiatic languages, to translate and publish oriental works of general interest; and we, therefore, beg to solicit from your Honourable Court such assistance as it may be disposed to grant for the promotion of this object.\n\nWe have the honour to be, Honourable Sirs, your most obedient humble servants,\n\n(Signed) H.

As\nyour invitation is flattering, I will not, however, fail to make every opportunity of keeping awake our correspondence, connected with the sciences and polite literature of the Hindus.\n\nThe formation of societies for the promotion of the knowledge of science and literature in general, as well as of arts and manufactures, is beneficial to the country where such bodies are united; but when they link with similar societies, or individuals of talent, in other countries by correspondence, the benefit arising therefrom is universal, especially when those learned men communicate their ideas to one another without regard to nation or religion.\n\nIn this good work the Europeans have far surpassed other nations; and allow me to express my admiration of the plan the Society has adopted for the diffusion of knowledge, by opening a correspondence with the natives of Hindustan, who cannot but feel immeasurable pleasure and gratitude, at the conviction that their rulers, in common with your Society, are ever watchful to promote the welfare of the ruled, by the dissemination of the knowledge of literature and arts among them.\n\nAs the Report of the Calcutta Agricultural Society, of which I have the honour to be Vice-president, will soon be published, I need not give you an account of the same here.\n\nSome time ago I published a Bengalee Spelling-book, in imitation of a similar useful work in English, by Mr. Lindley Murray, a copy of which, as well as a copy of the first volume of a copious Dictionary, entirely in Sanscrit, compiled by me, on the plan of an encyclopedia, I beg leave to send, and request the Society will have the goodness to give them a place in their library, allowing me at the same time permission to transmit the subsequent volumes, with the Preface and Appendix, when issued from the press.\n\nHaving lately had occasion to refer to the Agni Purana, I found a passage therein which convinced me that the division of the day and night into twenty-four hours, from midnight to midnight, by Europeans, is of Sanscrit origin; and as it may be a point deemed desirable to be known by many English gentlemen, I beg leave to transcribe the original, accompanied with a translation of it.\n\n\"\u0918\u091f\u093f\u0915\u0947 \u0926\u094d\u0935\u0947 \u092e\u0941\u0939\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0947\u0903 \u0938\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0924\u094d \u0924\u0947\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0936\u0924\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0926\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0928\u093f\u0936\u0947 \u0964\n\u091a\u0924\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0902\u0936\u0924\u093f \u0935\u0947\u0932\u093e\u092d\u093f\u0930\u0939\u094b\u0930\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0902 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0924\u0947 \u0965\n\u0938\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0926\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093f \u0935\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u092f\u094b \u092e\u0941\u0939\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0940\u0928\u093e\u0902 \u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e\u0903 \u0938\u0926\u093e \u0964\n\u092a\u0936\u094d\u091a\u093e\u0926\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0930\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0926\u093f \u0939\u094b\u0930\u093e\u0923\u093e\u0902 \u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e\u0903 \u0965\n\n\"Ghatike dve Muh\u00fartah sy\u00e1t taistrinsaty\u00e1 div\u00e1 nise; Chaturvinsati Bel\u00e1bh\u00edr ahor\u00e1tram prachashate.\"\n\n\"S\u00faryoday\u00e1di vijneyo Muh\u00fart\u00e1n\u00e1m cramah Sad\u00e1, Paschim\u00e1d ard'ha r\u00e1tr\u00e1di Hor\u00e1n\u00e1m vidyate cramah.\"\n\n\"Two ghaticas make one muhurta, of which thirty make a day and night.

Hence it appears that the word hour is probably derived from the Sanscrit term hor\u00e1, especially when the exact correspondence of the latter with the Greek and the Latin hora is considered.\n\nWishing you success in your benevolent exertions towards effecting the objects of your interesting Society, I remain, with due respect and regard, Gentlemen, your most obedient servant,\n\nRadhacant Deb.\n\nCalcutta, the 20th of May 1827.\nNOTE 5.\n\nExtracts from the Minutes of the Proceedings of the Committee of Correspondence of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nMarch 8th, 1828.\n\nSir Alexander Johnston, Chairman of the Committee, having submitted to the Committee a Dissertation on the Law of Siam, by Captain James Low, of Penang,\n\nIt was Resolved,\n\n\"That in consequence of the talent and spirit of inquiry evinced by Capt.

Abel Remusat, Secretary to the Asiatic Society at Paris, to Sir A. Johnston.\n\nParis, November 25, 1827.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Council of the Asiatic Society of Paris has received the letter in which you inform it of the intended publication of Messrs. T. and W. Daniell's Illustrations of India, and of the interest which the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland takes in the success of that enterprise. That interest is strongly participated in by the Asiatic Society of Paris, which knows that the approbation of your Society is granted only to useful works. The collection formed by Messrs. Daniell having also been most favourably noticed by His Royal Highness the Duke of Orleans, appears under such favourable auspices, that the Asiatic Society of Paris hastens to add its testimony of approbation to those which Messrs. Daniell have already received. In exemplification of this feeling, and for the purpose of complying with the desire expressed by His Royal Highness to the Council, in his letter of the 29th September, a commission was appointed, at the meeting held on the 1st October, to examine the drawings of Messrs. Daniell, and to report on them with as little delay as possible. This Commission, consisting of Messrs. J. P. Abel-Remusat, St. Martin and Eugene Burnouf, after having examined the materials collected by these learned artists, and obtaining from Mr. William Daniell all the necessary details on the nature of the subjects of which the work will be composed, and of the order in which they will be arranged, has communicated the result of its examination, and the expression of its high esteem for Messrs. Daniell and their important publication, in a report, which was read to the Society on the 6th November. On\n\n* In consequence of this recommendation, Captain Low and Baboo Radhacant Deb were elected corresponding members of the Royal Asiatic Society on the 17th of May 1828.\nthe occasion of that report being read, it was resolved, that the greatest possible publicity should be given to it, and that it should be immediately sent to the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, as a proof of the ardent desire felt by this Council to join with that Society in the encouragement of the publication of the Illustrations of India. That report I have now the honour of addressing to you, and request that you will communicate it to the learned body over which you preside.\n\nThe Council of the Asiatic Society of Paris, in unanimously adopting the conclusions contained in that report, has been actuated by the desire of shewing that it will not neglect any opportunity of uniting its efforts with those of the Royal Asiatic Society, for the advancement of the studies to which the Orientalists of both nations are equally devoted.\n\nAccept, Sir, the assurance of the most distinguished consideration with which I have the honour to be,\n\nYour very humble and obedient Servant,\n\n(Signed) J. P. ABEY-REMUSAT.\n\nSir Alex. Johnston received along with this letter the report to which it alludes, and a letter from the Baron Athalin, first aide-de-camp to his Royal Highness the Duke of Orleans, of which the following is a translation.\n\nTo Sir Alexander Johnston, Knt.\n\nSir:\n\nI was travelling when Mr. Daniell arrived in Paris, which prevented your letter, of which he was the bearer, reaching me till quite recently. Directly it was delivered I endeavoured to accomplish your wishes by making known to his Royal Highness the Duke of Orleans the interest that the Royal Asiatic Society, in its zeal for the promotion of the knowledge of Asia, takes in the publication of the Illustrations of India, by which those distinguished artists, Messrs. T. and W. Daniell, propose to complete their magnificent works, which have already so largely contributed to our acquaintance with that part of the globe.\n\nHis Royal Highness, highly appreciating the great skill of Messrs. Daniell, and desirous of encouraging a work which is so splendid a monument of persevering industry and highly cultivated talent, hastened to promote its success by immediately writing to Baron de Sacy, President of the Asiatic Society of Paris, recommending the Society, over which that much-respected Orientalist presides, to support, with all the means at its command, the intended publication.\n\nIn addition to addressing this recommendation to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique, His Royal Highness has subscribed for two copies, and their Royal Highnesses the Duchess of Orleans and Mademoiselle d'Orleans have each subscribed for one copy of Messrs. Daniell's very beautiful and interesting views; to which also their Royal Highnesses have graciously expressed their intention, as opportunities offer, of directing the notice of those August Personages whose patronage will effectively promote the rapid increase of the list of subscribers.\n\nHis Royal Highness has been highly gratified by the occurrence of this opportunity of testifying his esteem for Mr. Daniell, and of evincing his anxiety to execute the wishes of the Royal Asiatic Society which has enrolled him among its honorary members, and of which you are the organ. That Society could not have chosen a more acceptable medium of communication to his Royal Highness, who recollects with much pleasure his former acquaintance with you, and is highly sensible of the obliging manner in which you have conveyed to him your ideas on Mr. Daniell's unrivalled collection of drawings relating to India.\n\nPermit me to congratulate myself on having been selected to address you on this occasion, as it has given me an opportunity of rendering homage to talents, of which I am one of the most ardent admirers, and accept the expression of the high consideration with which I have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour very humble and obedient Servant,\n\n(Signed) BARON ATHALIN,\n\nAide-de-camp to his Royal Highness the Duke of Orleans.\n\nNeuilly, the 29th of September 1827.\nAPPENDIX, No. IV.\n\nAT THE\n\nANNUAL MEETING OF THE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY,\n\nHeld on the 15th of March, 1829;\n\nSir Alexander Johnston, Chairman of the Committee of Correspondence,\nhaving verbally reported the proceedings of that Committee since the Anniversary\nin 1828;\n\nIt was RESOLVED,\n\n\"That he be requested to reduce his report to writing, and that it be printed\n\"in the Appendix to the Society's Transactions.\"\n\nSECOND REPORT\n\nOF THE\n\nCOMMITTEE OF CORRESPONDENCE\n\nOF THE\n\nRoyal Asiatic Society.\n\nThe Committee will now proceed to explain to the Society the various subjects to\nwhich they have directed their attention, the new sources of information which have\nbeen opened to their inquiries, and the different circumstances which have occurred in\nEngland and in India, illustrative of such a spirit of liberality and inquiry, both on the\npart of Government and on that of the people of the country, as must powerfully\nassist the Society in attaining the wise and benevolent ends for which it has been es-\ntablished.\n\nThe Subjects to which the Committee have directed their Attention are:\n\n1st. The Astronomy and Geography of India.\n2d. The Geology and Mineralogy of India.\n3d. The Botany of India.\n4th. Zoology, as it relates to the quadrupeds, the insects, the fish, and the\nconchology of India.\n5th. The Architecture, the Sculpture, the Ancient Inscriptions, and the\nPainting of India.\n6th. The History of the People of India as illustrated by their systems of law, by their divisions into castes, and by the nature of their tenures and assessments of land.\n\n1st. The Astronomy and Geography of India.\n\nAs to the Astronomy of India, the Committee have forwarded to each of the presidencies of India such queries as may enable the people of those presidencies to obtain without difficulty the information which the Society requires from them. Col. Caulfield, late political resident at Kotah, in the Rajpoot country, sent the Society some time ago an instrument used by the natives of that country for making astronomical observations. The Sanscrit characters on this instrument have been translated by Dr. Rosen; the instrument itself, with an English translation of the characters, has been submitted by the Committee for examination to Mr. Hart, a gentleman of distinguished talents at Glasgow, who has already directed his attention to an instrument of this sort given him by an officer from India, the characters on which being Arabic, have been translated into English for him by Dr. Dorn. The Committee have also submitted to Mr. Hart for examination a forestaff, which Sir Alex. Johnston, while on the island of Ceylon, obtained from one of the native pilots of the Maldiva vessels which trade from the islands of Maldiva to Ceylon, Bengal, and Malacca. A forestaff of this description, a French ephemeris, and a chart of their own construction, are the means by which the Maldiva pilots are enabled to navigate their vessels from their own islands to the foreign ports which they frequent. This forestaff is very similar to the instrument which was in general use amongst European navigators before the invention of the quadrant, and is supposed to have been derived by the Arabs, who navigated the Indian seas in the fifteenth century, from Vasco de Gama and the other early Portuguese navigators.\n\nDr. Dorn has, at the request of the Committee, drawn up an able and interesting account of the brass globe which is in the Museum of the Society.* There are only three globes of this kind known at present in Europe; one in Italy, one in Germany, and one in the Society's Museum. They are all supposed to have been made by Arab astronomers in the thirteenth century; one of them in Egypt; the other at Maragha, in Bucharia; and the third at Mousul, where at that time there were several very able astronomers, whose astronomical tables are still extant and used in the East.\n\nSir Alex. Johnston has presented to the Society a collection of drawings made for him by a native of Ceylon, illustrating the various modes in which astronomy as connected with astrology is observed by the natives of the country to exercise a powerful influence over the religious and moral conduct of the people of that island. In this collection are several drawings of the twelve signs of the zodiac, as represented in different parts of the country and on the island of Ramisseram, and which form a portion of a more extensive collection which Sir Alex. Johnston is making of drawings of the signs of the zodiac as represented in every part of Asia. The Committee being\n\n* This paper is printed in the present volume of the Society's Transactions.\naware of the influence of astrology amongst all the natives of India, and conceiving that much curious information relative to the knowledge of astronomy which they formerly possessed may be obtained from their works and opinions upon astrology, have adopted measures for collecting information upon that subject from other parts of India.\n\nAs to the Geography of India, the Committee are about to procure several topographical surveys and maps of different parts of India and Asia which are in manuscript, in the possession of persons who collected them while they were in India, but who do not intend to publish them, and are therefore willing to give them to the Society, in order that they may be preserved for the use of future geographers. Lieut.-Col. Doyle has given the Society some maps of the chain of mountains in Southern India which are called the Ghauts. Sir Alexander Johnston has also given a collection of maps and charts relating to the coasts of Coromandel and Malabar, to the Gulf of Manar, to the coast and interior of the island of Ceylon, and particularly to the whole of the Pearl and Chank Banks on the north coast of that island and the southern coast of the peninsula of India, the whole of which were collected by Sir Alexander in 1809, for the purpose of explaining to the late Lord Londonderry, the then secretary of state for the colonies, the manner in which the pearl and chank fisheries might be improved, and the passage between the island of Manar and the island of Ceylon on the one side, and that between the island of Ramisseram and the peninsula of India on the other, might be deepened, so as to admit of being navigated by vessels of very considerable burthen.\n\n2d. The Geology and Mineralogy of India.\n\nAs to the Geology of India, a set of instructions were drawn up some time ago by the Board of Ordnance, in communication with the Geological Society in England, for the purpose of enabling the officers who were engaged in the survey of Ireland to collect such geological information about Ireland as might serve for a geological map of that country. The Committee have, through the assistance of Dr. Fitton, the late president of the Geological Society, procured a copy of those instructions, and are about to send a set of them to each of the governments in India, in order that they may obtain for the Society, through their surveyors and other civil and military officers, such geological information as may in time afford materials for forming a geological map of the whole of British India.\n\nAs to the Mineralogy of India, the Committee have amongst other things directed the attention of their correspondents in India to the various minerals which are found in India, and particularly to the coals, the iron, and the copper, to the aqua marines upon the southern peninsula of India, and to the different descriptions of precious stones in Ceylon.\n\n3d. The Botany of India.\n\nThe Committee hope to receive from Dr. Wallich a set of instructions upon this subject; they have in the meantime instituted inquiries into the nature of the different descriptions of woods which are in general use throughout India, and into that of the different descriptions of vegetables which are considered by the natives of the country.\nto be fit for the purposes either of dyes, of medicine, or of food. They will endeavour to ascertain the nature of the plant in the south-east part of Ceylon which was supposed by the late governor Van Der Graaf to be a species of the tea plant, and procure his report upon the best means of rearing the real tea plant in that island. They will also try to procure the very able and interesting report which was drawn up about sixty years ago by the head of the Dutch medical department in Ceylon, stating it as his opinion that a substitute for almost every vegetable used in Europe for medicine could be found growing upon that island.\n\nThey are collecting information relative to the teak and the poon tree, to the indigo plant, the chayah root, and the sapan wood: to all the vegetable productions of India which are supposed to be substitutes for the medicines of Europe; to the cinnamon and other spice trees, to the tobacco plant, the bread-fruit tree, and all the different species of palms; they are endeavouring to ascertain which of these are the original growth of India, which of them have been introduced from other countries; the different persons, Arabs, Portuguese, Dutch and English, to whom India is indebted for the principal foreign plants or vegetables which have at different times been introduced into the country, and the political, moral, and commercial effects, which may be attributed to their introduction amongst the natives of India.\n\nThe extensive consequences which have followed the introduction of the potatoe into Europe and the sugar cane into the West-Indies, shew the great influence which such events may have upon the comfort and happiness of mankind; and the present condition of whole classes of people in the East-Indies, is a powerful illustration of this subject. The cultivation of the palm called the jaggery tree, of the cinnamon tree, and of the chaya root, have given rise to three distinct castes amongst the people of Ceylon, each of which has many remarkable and peculiar habits and usages, the origin and history of which, if attentively considered, must afford an interesting subject of reflection to the philosopher and the statesman.\n\n4th. The Zoology of India.\n\nThe Committee have obtained, through the assistance of Mr. Clift, the set of instructions which the Royal College of Surgeons have drawn up for persons who are employed in making collections in Zoology. These instructions specify the particular description of quadrupeds, birds, fish, &c. which are still wanted; the countries in which they are likely to be found, and the means by which the specimens when procured may be preserved and sent in safety to England. The Committee have forwarded copies of these instructions to each of the governors, and to some of their correspondents in India. The labours of Messieurs Diard, Devaucel, and Leschanault de la Tour shew what a field India affords for the researches of the Zoologist. The introduction into France from Asia, by Jaubert, of the breed of Cashmerian goats, should encourage others to imitate his example in so useful an undertaking. The Committee have therefore instituted inquiries respecting the goats from the wool of which the fine Cashmere shawls are manufactured, and the animal which produces the musk.\nMr. Samouelle, who is attached to the entomological department of the British Museum, has presented to Sir Alexander Johnston several copies of his work, which contains very useful instructions for the entomologist. The Committee have forwarded these copies to Calcutta, Madras, Bombay and Ceylon. The number and variety of Insects is very great in all tropical climates, but particularly in that of India, and the discovery of the cochineal insect in Mexico, so valuable from its red dye, is a proof of the advantage which may accrue to manufactures and commerce from inquiries relative to the nature and properties even of the smallest insects.\n\nMonsieur Valenciennes, who is now in this country, and is occupied with Baron Cuvier in preparing a valuable work on Fish, has, at the request of the Committee, drawn up a set of instructions, for the guidance of those who may be employed by them in forming collections of fish. Great progress has of late been made in every part of the world in this branch of natural history. Although the celebrated work of Monsieur Lacepede contains a description of no more than one thousand five hundred species of fish; there are at present specimens of upwards of six thousand species in the cabinet of Natural History at Paris. The number of species found in India is much greater than that which is discovered in Europe. There are only fifty different species of fresh water fish in all the rivers in France, while there are upwards of two hundred and seventy already described by Hamilton in the river Ganges alone. Many species of fish common in the Indian seas form a very lucrative article of trade. The inhabitants of the Maldiva islands derive great advantage from the extensive trade they carry on with the rest of India in the dried bonita fish, and the shells called cowries which are found in the neighbourhood of those islands.\n\nThe Committee being aware of the value of the Pearl and Chank Fisheries on the northern and eastern coasts of Ceylon, and of the facility of observing the progress of the coral formation, in the gulf of Manar, have directed inquiries to be made into the natural history of the pearl oyster and chank shells, and into the process by which the coral is formed, and by which it becomes so powerful an agent in producing very extensive banks in that as well as in other parts of the Indian seas.\n\n5th. The Architecture, the Sculpture, the Ancient Inscriptions and the Paintings of India.\n\nWith respect to the Architecture of India, the Committee are about to have translations made of the works which describe the Hindoo, the Buddhic, and the Mahomedan systems of architecture. The work which contains an account of the first system is in Sanscrit, and is called the Silpa Sastra; Col. Tod has four and Sir Alexander Johnston has five books of this work. The work which contains an account of the second is in Pali and Cingalese, and is also called the Silpa Sastra, and Sir Alexander has a considerable portion of it. The work which treats of the third system is understood to be in one of the libraries in Spain, and is said to contain an account of the systems of Saracenic or Moorish Architecture, which prevailed in the Moorish Kingdoms of Granada, Seville, and Cordova, in those of Africa, and Asia Minor, and in those of Tartary and India. The Committee being desirous of illustrating these systems by drawings and\nmodels, have procured such instructions from Mr. Robinson, a distinguished architect, as will enable them to collect the materials necessary for such an object.\n\nWith respect to the state of Sculpture, as well in those parts of India where the Hindoo religion, as in those where the Buddhic religion prevails, the Committee will be able to derive information from His Highness the Raja of Tanjore,* from the collection of drawings made by the late Col. Mackenzie, and from the models presented to the Society by Sir Alexander Johnston.\n\nWith respect to the art of Painting in India, the Committee are endeavouring to collect specimens of it, both antient and modern, from different parts of Asia, with a view of tracing the progress of that art in India from the earliest times to the present period, and explaining the manner in which the natives of the country have from time to time made use of it for the purpose of influencing the religious, the moral, and the political conduct of their countrymen.\n\nThe Committee have directed their attention to a collection of drawings, and to some paintings on a large wooden box, presented to the Society by Sir Alexander Johnston: the former were executed by a Cingalese in Ceylon; the latter by a Hindoo artist in the province of Madura in the peninsula of India in the seventeenth century. The box belonged to Mongama, who was Ranee or Queen of Madura at that time. The paintings on the box were executed by her direction, and represent some of the principal trades in her country, for the purpose, it is said, of reminding her (the box being constantly before her, and containing her state papers) of the national importance of every description of manufacture and trade.\n\n6th. The History of the People of India, as illustrated by their different Laws, their different Castes, and their different Tenures of Land.\n\nWith respect to their laws, the Committee have considered them under four separate heads: those of the Buddhists, those of the Hindoos, those of the Mahomedans, and those of the maritime people of Asia. The Committee have referred for information upon this subject to printed and to written books, to the decisions of courts of justice, and to the collections of customs in different parts of India. The works to which the Committee have referred are some of them in European, and some in Oriental languages. The decisions are those of the several Zillah, Provincial, and Sudder Adawlut Courts in India, and of the King in Council in England.\n\n* In consequence of the enlightened patronage which this prince, himself the \u00e9l\u00e8ve of the celebrated missionary Schwartz, has always given to the arts of Europe, particularly to that of sculpture, Sir Alexander Johnston, who, while he was at Tanjore, had an opportunity of knowing his sentiments upon the subject, sent him out, at the same time with his diploma of Honorary Member of the Royal Asiatic Society, as a mark of respect from his relative, the Hon. Mrs. Damer, a colossal bust, executed by herself in bronze, of the late Lord Nelson. The English translation of the letter which his Highness wrote to the Society acknowledging the receipt of the diploma and the bust is appended to this Report, and affords a decisive proof of the sentiments which his Highness entertains of the great advantages which may be derived by the natives of India from the establishment of the Royal Asiatic Society.\nThe decisions of the latter, on appeals from the several courts of Sudder Adawlut in India, are but few. In consequence, however, of communications which Sir Alexander Johnston has had with his Majesty's Ministers, the President of the Board of Control, and the Chairman of the East-India Company, arrangements will be made, by which all the cases now in arrear will be brought forward, and those which may be appealed in future will be decided without delay. Reports of the cases and of the decisions will be printed and published, and will afford the Society authentic information as to what the King in Council conceives to be the genuine laws of all the natives who are under the British authority in India.\n\nWith respect to the collections of customs in different parts of India, the Committee hope to derive much information from the reports which have been made to the several governments of India by many of the civil and military servants of the East-India Company; and also from the inquiries which will be made by Lord William Bentinck, who, in consequence of a communication which he had with Sir Alexander Johnston previous to his departure from England, is likely to adopt the same mode for collecting all the local laws and customs of the different people of India as has been adopted by the government of Ceylon for collecting all the local laws and customs of the different people in that island.\n\nWith respect to the different Castes of the natives of India, the Committee conceive that the influence of caste upon the feelings of the people of India is a subject most worthy of the consideration of the moralist and the statesman; it may be used with great advantage by those who are in authority to reconcile the people to the adoption of the most beneficial improvements, and much information may be collected upon the subject from some of the Company's military and civil servants who are now in England, from many of the papers of the late Col. Mackenzie, from the Budhoo priests on Ceylon, and from their works, which are valuable, in consequence of their containing information upon the subject of caste, which differs materially from that in works written by the Brahmins, and throws a new light upon the origin of castes and the subsequent modifications which the Brahmins have introduced in them, for the purpose of establishing and perpetuating their religious and political ascendancy over the people of the country.\n\nWith respect to the tenures of Land\u2014the state of agriculture, the happiness of the people, and the revenue of Government, depend upon an accurate knowledge on the part of those who are at the head of the government of the history and the moral and political effects of the different tenures under which land is held, and the different proportion of its produce which is exacted by Government in different parts of India. The Committee, in tracing the history of tenures in ancient times, will refer to the series of ancient inscriptions upon this subject in the Mackenzie Collection. In tracing the history of tenures in more modern times, it must look for information from those members of the Society who for so many years while in office in India have devoted their time and their talents to a full consideration of the question.\nThe new Sources of Information which have been opened to their Inquiries.\n\nThere are four new sources from whence the Committee expect to derive valuable information. The first is Baron Mayendorff; the second is Baron A. Humboldt; the third is Monsieur Jacquemont; the fourth is Lord Dalhousie and Sir Edward Owen.\n\nBaron Mayendorff, who was sent out two years ago by the Russian government on a mission from Orenbourg to Bokhara, is now an active member of the Oriental Committee at St. Petersburg, the principal business of which is to regulate the intercourse which takes place between Russia and Asia. The brother of the Baron is now in England, and has expressed to the Committee the Baron's wish to communicate with it upon every subject relative to Asia on which he can afford it any information. The Committee have availed themselves of this offer, and expect to derive information from the Baron, and from those who accompanied him on his mission to Bokhara, relative to the intercourse which is kept up between the Russians at Kiakhta and the frontiers of China\u2014relative to the different tribes of people, and the different countries with which he became acquainted while on his route from Orenbourg to Bokhara, and also relative to the parts of Asia which were visited by another Russian officer, who was sent by the Emperor to the Khan of Khiva, and who obtained much new and curious information concerning the geology and natural history of the country which is situated between the Aral Lake and the Caspian Sea. Through the Baron, the Committee hope to procure a copy of the collection of the customary laws of the Kalmucks, and of that of the customary laws of the Georgians. The establishment of the free port, called the Redout Koul\u00e9, to the South of Anapa, at the mouth of the Phasis, affords the Russian government great facilities for procuring an intimate knowledge of Georgia, Circassia and Armenia; and the late war with Persia, and the present one with Turkey, have enabled it to obtain some very valuable Persian, Arabic, and Armenian works. By a clause in the treaty of peace which Russia has recently concluded with Persia, the former government is authorized to take out of the libraries in Persia such works as may be deemed objects of literary curiosity. The Committee expect, by the assistance of Prince Lieven, soon to procure a list of these works, and of all those which are in the libraries of Etchmiacin and Ardebil. The former of these libraries has been visited by Col. D'Arcy, who has made drawings of the Armenian convent in which the books are kept, and of Mount Ararat, near the foot of which this convent is situated. Ardebil has been taken by the Russians, who have carefully preserved all the works that were in the library: many of them are valuable, being Arabic translations of the Greek classics, made in the ninth and tenth centuries, by the Nestorian Christians, who were employed by the Caliphs of Bagdad for that purpose. It is believed that there is amongst these works an Arabic translation of some of the books of Aristotle, the Greek original of which has been lost.\n\nThe second new source of information is Baron A. Humboldt, who is about to visit in the first instance the Ural Mountains; and in the second, the Caucasus. As this\ncelebrated traveller has offered to procure for the Society any information which they may require relative to the countries which are situated in the neighbourhood of those mountains, the Committee will communicate with him upon the subject, and expect to acquire from him a knowledge of many historical facts, which will be of use in tracing the origin and history of many of the Tartar tribes who inhabit those vast regions which are in the vicinity of the northern boundaries of India.\n\nThe third new source of information is Monsieur Jacquemont, whom the French government have sent to India for six years, with a very liberal allowance, for the purpose of examining the whole chain of the Himalaya mountains, from east to west, and the whole chain of the mountains called the Ghauts, which extend through the peninsula of India from Guzerat North to Cape Comorin South. The French government, before his departure for India, sent Monsieur Jacquemont over to this country, in order that he might consult the Directors of the East-India Company and the members of the Royal Asiatic Society, as to the best mode of attaining the scientific and literary objects which he had in view. Monsieur Jacquemont carried out with him letters of recommendation from the Board of Control, the Court of Directors, and this Society, to the different persons who are in authority in India; and upon his arrival in that country, will advise with Lord William Bentinek and Sir John Malcolm as to the route he will pursue. He has, with the greatest liberality, promised to transmit to the Royal Asiatic Society duplicates of all the specimens of natural history which he may be enabled to collect; and Sir Edward Owen, who is Commander-in-chief of the British Navy in India, and an active member of the Society, will facilitate the sending to England of all these specimens, by requesting the commanding officer of each of the King's ships which may be coming to England to convey them without delay, to the Society in London.\n\nThe fourth new source of information, is: Lord Dalhousie, the Commander-in-chief of the army, and Sir Edward Owen, the Commander-in-chief of the navy in India. The former will exert his influence throughout his command, to assist the researches of the Society in every part of India in which any military person may be stationed; the latter, besides exerting a similar influence over all the individuals who may be under his authority, will direct his attention particularly to the examination of the Maldive and Lacadive Islands, the Gulf of Manar, the coast of Malabar and Coromandel, the Nicobar and Andaman Islands, and the Straits of Malacca, Banca, and Singapore.\n\nThe different circumstances which have occurred in England and in India illustrative of such a spirit of liberality and inquiry, both on the part of Government and on that of the People of the country, as must powerfully assist the Society in attaining the wise and benevolent ends for which it has been established.\n\nThe enlightened conduct of Mr. Wynn while President of the Board of Control, that of the two Houses of Parliament while legislating for British India, and that of\nthe natives of Bombay while testifying their respect for the late Sir Edward West are decided indications of the liberal sentiments which at present prevail, as well amongst the most distinguished officers of Government as amongst the most respectable natives of India, and shew the effect which such sentiments have produced in promoting a love of knowledge, and in forwarding the views of the Royal Asiatic Society in every part of the British territories in Asia. Mr. Wynn, by making civil appointments to India a public reward for literary merit at two of the most celebrated places of education in Great Britain, has secured as well for Oriental literature as for the people of India the talents and services of some of the most distinguished young men in Great Britain. The British Parliament, by passing the Indian Jury Act, have deliberately recorded it as their opinion that the natives of British India are capable, from their understanding, their education, and their integrity, of receiving and exercising the most valuable rights of a free people\u2014they have set a bright and important example to future legislators\u2014have raised the people of India in the estimation of the people of England\u2014have rendered the former an object of enquiry, respect, and sympathy to the latter; and have made the subjects of Great Britain in Europe anxious to communicate to the subjects of Great Britain in Asia such portions of their knowledge, science, and literature, as may suit the present circumstances of that ancient people, and promote their industry, their wealth, their freedom, and their happiness. The British Parliament, by calling upon the natives of British India to exercise the rights of enlightened and independent Jurymen, have afforded them a public opportunity of displaying their talents, their integrity, and their knowledge, in defence of the lives, the liberty, and the property of their countrymen; and have given them a most powerful motive for cultivating their understanding, for improving their moral character, and for acquiring from Great Britain every useful branch of scientific, moral, and political information. The inhabitants of Bombay, by erecting professorships in the name and to the honour of the late Sir Edward West, have shewn how highly the rights of British subjects are appreciated by them, and how directly they tend to promote a desire for education and useful knowledge amongst the natives of India. The person to whose memory the honour is paid was a most able and independent Judge, who taught the natives of Bombay, that the object of the British Legislature in framing the Jury Act was to render them the guardians of the lives, the liberty, and the property of their countrymen; and to encourage them, with a view of making them worthy of that high trust, to acquire a thorough knowledge of the religion, the laws, the customs, and the literature of their country. The persons by whom the honour is paid consist amongst others of some of the most distinguished of the Parsees at Bombay, who are celebrated throughout Asia for the extent of their trade, for the integrity of their character, and for the progress which they have made in manufactures, in ship-building, and in every branch of theoretical and practical mechanics; and who, from having themselves exercised the duties of Jurymen, are aware of the practical utility and value of the institution, and feel the necessity of improving their education, cultivating their understanding, and\nextending their knowledge, for the purpose of enabling them to discharge those duties with credit to themselves, and advantage to their countrymen.\n\nThese enlightened men have publicly declared, in their address to the Supreme Court at Bombay, that the most appropriate honour they can shew the memory of Sir Edward West is to affix his name to the professorships which they have established, and thereby associate for ever, in the minds of their posterity, the recollection of his virtues, with a feeling of gratitude to his memory for the advantages they will derive from establishments that improve their understanding and secure their prosperity and happiness. The public opinions, and the public conduct of such men, upon such an occasion, are a forcible illustration of the certainty with which a desire to improve the human understanding, and to facilitate the acquisition of useful knowledge is produced, by allowing the natives of India to enjoy the institutions, and to exercise the rights of British subjects, and afford, at the present moment, very important information to the Legislature of Great Britain, as to the surest means of raising the moral character and improving the political situation of the natives of that immense empire.\n\n---\n\n**Letter referred to in the preceding Report.**\n\n\"To the Hon. Sir Alexander Johnston, Knt. &c. &c. &c.\n\n\"His Highness Chatterputty Rajashree Maharajah Sirfojee Rajah Saheb, presents\n\n\"his Compliments.\n\n\"SIR,\n\n\"The Letter which you did me the favour to write to me, together with the bust of the late Admiral Lord Nelson, and the Diploma appointing me the first Honorary Member of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain, reached Tanjore in safety some time ago, and were delivered to me by the Resident. I must beg that the delay which has occurred in acknowledging their arrival may not be considered as any proof that I am indifferent about such flattering marks of distinction; on the contrary, I request that you will assure both the Royal Asiatic Society and the Hon. Mrs. Damer, that I fully appreciate the compliment which they have respectively been pleased to pay to me.\n\n\"I wish I could persuade myself that these compliments were well merited, but I am sensible that I am indebted for them to the partiality of your representations. It is true, indeed, that I have always taken great pleasure in endeavouring, by the establishment of Free Schools, and every other means in my power, to promote among my people the general diffusion of useful knowledge, and the study of such Arts and Sciences as I thought might be conducive to their temporal advantage or...\"\nmoral improvement; but it would be wrong to say, that from what little has been done, much good has already resulted. The character and manners of every people are necessarily, in some degree, modified by circumstances, which, though certain in their result, are more or less slow in operation. In the present state of India, while knowledge is unprofitable, few can afford to become wise, or to devote themselves, whatever predilections may exist, to any particular study or pursuit which does not hold out a fair prospect of a livelihood; but the British nation must, ere now, have seen enough of their Asiatic subjects to know that they are naturally clear-sighted to their own interests, and keen and persevering in the pursuit of them; they will therefore very readily cultivate such talents as are likely to find profitable and honourable employment, and better their actual condition in life, as well as enlighten their understandings. For a long time to come these two objects must of necessity go hand in hand; but concluding that a liberal and enlightened Government, anxious for the happiness and prosperity of its subjects, will not be sparing in the requisite incentives to laudable ambition and honourable exertion, I hope it will be found that the moral and political improvement of the people, the development of useful talents and good qualities, and their progress in Literature, Science, and the Arts, will keep pace with the encouragement held out to them, and the confidence bestowed upon them by those rulers in whose hands Providence has placed their destiny.\n\nI must again repeat my acknowledgments to your relation, the Hon. Mrs. Damer, who at so much personal trouble has sent me a very beautiful specimen of an elegant art; and I beg you will do me the favour to assure the Royal Asiatic Society that I trust their labours may tend to make Europeans and Asiatics better acquainted with each other, and be rewarded with the other benefits and advantages contemplated by its illustrious and enlightened founders.\n\nWhat can I say more?\n\nTanjore,\n\n11th October, 1828.\n\n(Signed) Sree Ram Pretap.\n\n(True version.)\n\n(Signed) John Fyfe.\nAPPENDIX, No. IV*.\n\nMETEOROLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS,\nMADE AT PORT LOUIS, IN THE MAURITIUS,\nDURING THE YEAR 1828.\n\nCommunicated by His Excellency Lieut.-General the Hon.

The Barometer was at 27\u00b05\u00b07, and the Centigrade Thermometer at 26\u00b00. The wind E., with hard squalls and storms. The lowest degree of humidity was 73\u00b0 at noon on the 14th May, the Barometer being at 28\u00b04\u00b00, and the Thermometer at 25\u00b05; the wind gentle and variable.\n\nThe greatest heat was 32\u00b03 at one in the afternoon, on the 5th of February, the Barometer being at 28\u00b02\u00b05, and the Hygrometer at 84\u00b03, with a light breeze from the the N.E. and a distant storm. The least degree of heat was 17\u00b08 on the morning of the 31st of August, when the Barometer was at 28\u00b05\u00b04, and the Hygrometer at 86\u00b08, with a fresh breeze from the S.E. and drizzling rain.\n\nThe greatest elevation of the mercury in the Barometer was 28\u00b07 on the 30th of August at noon; the Thermometer being at 22\u00b03, and the Hygrometer at 82\u00b03, with a fresh breeze from the S.E. The least elevation was 28\u00b00 on the 13th of February, at one in the afternoon; the Thermometer being at 29\u00b07, and the Hygrometer at 89\u00b03, with a fresh breeze from the S.W., and a storm in the N.W.\n\nThe S.E. monsoon set in on the 27th of April. During the hurricane of the 6th and 7th of March the Barometer descended to 27\u00b04.\n\nViolent squalls the 23rd and 24th of March from the S.E to S.W. by S.\n\nFrom the 1st of January to the 31st of December, 56 inches 3 lines and 3-10ths of rain fell.\n\n**LISLET GEOFFROY,**  \nCorrespondent of the Royal Academy of Sciences of the French Institute.\nREMARKS.\n\nThe preceding Observations were made in the Rue de Pondicherry, at the entrance to the Champ de Lort, at an elevation of 42 feet 11 inches above the level of the sea.\n\nThe scale of the Barometer is divided into inches, lines, and twelfths; that of the Thermometer and of the Hygrometer is divided according to the centesimal division, and that of the Eudiometer into lines and tenths. The instruments were examined in the morning half an hour before sunrise, and between noon and one o'clock in the open air; and in the evening at sunset, in the house.\nAPPENDIX, No. V.\n\nAMENDED NOTES to Mr. Hodgson's \"Sketch of Buddhism.\"*\n\nThe following Memorandum was received from Mr. Hodgson, subsequently to the publication of his \"Sketch of Buddhism,\" in the first part of this volume, and of course, too late to make the alterations he wished in the Notes appended to that Paper. The Council, however, have considered it but just to Mr. Hodgson himself, as well as due to the Public, that all the information they possess upon this abstruse point should be submitted in its most perfect form, and have accordingly directed the publication of this Paper in the Appendix to the Volume. It may be added, that in a Letter accompanying the present Memorandum, Mr. Hodgson refers those who feel a desire to become better acquainted with the Metaphysics and Mysticism of the Baudh\u0101na Philosophy and Religion, to a Paper upon that subject, in the sixteenth volume of the Bengal Asiatic Researches, which he considers the more perfect result of his labours in that particular branch of Oriental science.\n\nI should recommend it to those who would read the following paper with advantage, first to cast an eye over the faint outline of Saugata philosophy, which I have attempted to delineate in the sixteenth volume of the Bengal Asiatic Society's Transactions, pp. 435-440.\n\nThe religious system of the Buddhas is founded upon abstruse philosophical speculations, embracing very different notions respecting mind and matter\u2014a first cause\u2014and the nature and destiny of the human soul; and, whatever may be the case with regard to Brahmanism, it is certainly true of Buddhism that its philosophy is inseparably blended with its religion.\n\nFurther, though Buddhism, considered as a system of religion, was originally characterised by a great degree of simplicity, there can, I think, be no doubt that that simplicity was early abandoned, when Buddhism came to be generally diffused among the multitude.\n\nA system inculcating the severest mental abstraction and physical privations (to say nothing of its speculative atheistical tendency) was not calculated for popular use; and it may be safely assumed that the same age which beheld Buddhism exalted to a public faith, saw it also materially modified in its essential characteristics. But at what precise\n\n* For the Sketch of Buddhism, see pp. 222-257 of this volume.\nperiod, and in what country, did these modifications take place? And how far are they entitled to be considered part and parcel of genuine Buddhism? That they originated in India, the cradle of Saugatism, and that they were received by the Buddhas of that country, and consequently are entitled to be regarded as an integral portion of the system, are inferences which seem to me legitimately to flow, as well from the intrinsic considerations above adverted to, as from the fact, that the Raksha Bhagavati, the Prajna Parmita, and other of the most ancient Buddha works of authority, still extant in Nipal, exhibit a strange complication of ideas purely Saugata, with others which are clearly drawn from the same fount with, or are borrowed from, that heterogeneous mass which we call Hinduism.\n\nIt is unquestionable that the books above adverted to are not peculiar to Nipal; for they exhibit a system of doctrines, or at least of discipline, which is materially different from that which has prevailed for ages, and still continues to prevail there; and they are besides composed in the Sanscrit language\u2014a language radically differing from the Nipali. True it is that the learned Saugatas of Nipal understand that language, and regard it as their sacred dialect; but from time immemorial they have possessed too little science, and too little literary encouragement to produce such vast and abstruse works as the Raksha Bhagavati, which alone contains 125,000 sentences, and was, I am persuaded, composed in India: such, too, is the decided opinion of every well-informed Buddha with whom I have conversed. The Buddhism of the Raksha Bhagavati, of the Prajna Parmita, and the rest of the nine Dharmas, is certainly not the simple and consistent creation of a single mind; but a vast mass compiled piece-meal, and at long intervals, by several persons, and owing its present scriptural form only to an individual. And upon the authority of these great works I venture to assert, not only that the founders of Buddhism differed among themselves, but also that many new teachers arose at various times, who modified each and all of the ancient doctrines; and that many of these new opinions were ultimately incorporated with the sacred writings of the sect.\n\nIt is obvious that such a system, prevailing, as it did, for ages in India before it was uprooted by violence, and subjected to the changes inseparable from transplantation into other climes, must be studied historically as well as philosophically, before we can hope to acquire a just conception of its entire or genuine character. My own opinion (as I have already intimated) is, that in the Raksha Bhagavati and the nine Dharmas are contained most of the essential opinions and practices inculcated by the Buddhism of India; but the following sketch and notes, not having been drawn from a direct or adequate acquaintance with those works, cannot pretend to exhibit the true features of that system, considered without reference to local interpolation. The sketch, however, assuredly exhibits many glimpses of those features, and therefore I have denominated it a \"Sketch of Buddhism.\" The cautious may, if they please, regard it as merely displaying some traces of the local Saugatism of Nipal, in which they will perceive a large admixture of Saiva and Saka principles. Owing to the vast extent and complexity of Buddhism\u2014to its philosophy embracing a variety of very opposite opinions\u2014to its mythology being blended with its philosophy\u2014to a great number of leading terms in the\nformer being common (though, of course, in more or less different senses) to all the various schools of the latter\u2014and, lastly, owing to our present ignorance how far and in what sense the followers of these diverse speculative systems adopted the whole of that which has come down to us as the practical religious system of the Buddhas, it becomes a very nice and arduous task to estimate, with any degree of correctness, the meaning of such detached statements as are presented to us, either by personal communication with these religionists, or by reference (any thing but complete) to their voluminous written authorities.\n\nFrom such sources, however, I shall now attempt an elucidation, in the shape of notes, of such parts of my Buddha friend's sketch as seem to me to need it, and lie within the compass of my own information and ability.\n\nAlterations in the Notes appended to the Sketch.\n\n(For Note 1, substitute what follows.)\n\n(1.) Here a sentence is quoted from the Sambha Purana; and it was at first my intention to have retained the original Sanscrit of the passage, cited from sacred authority, in this as in several subsequent instances. Upon reflection, however, I believe it will be better to omit these citations altogether, which are of very various, and often (as I have proved) of very doubtful authority or accuracy; and to endeavour to illustrate the statements of my friend by some remarks which my own more recent investigations have enabled me to make.\n\nThe Sambha or Swoyambha Purana is a local work peculiar to Nipal; but many other Buddha scriptures, which are not local and are of high authority, symbolize the ruling powers of nature by the letters of the alphabet;\u2014and some of those scriptures (chiefly perhaps such as are of an Aishwarika tendency) ascribe the pre-eminence among these letters to A, U, and M, forming the mystic word Aum, which would appear to be not less reverenced by Bauddhas than by Brahmanists. The invocation of the Tri Ratha, or Triad (\"namah Buddhaiya, namah Dharmaiya, namah Sangaiya\") is so popular and prevalent with the Bauddhas that one might almost be justified in calling it their confession of faith.\n\nA, the Bauddhas say, is the \"vija mantra\" of the person (surir) Buddha;\u2014U, the \"vija mantra\" of the person Dharma;\u2014and M, that of the person Sanga; and these three persons form the Buddhist Triad:\u2014a Triad consisting not merely of the attributes of a first cause or causes, nor (as has been supposed) of abstract moral qualities,\u2014but of persons; at least of mythological persons.\n\nThe Bauddhas, however, differ in their conceptions both of the relative rank and of the positive character of the two first of these three persons; as indeed they do upon many other points of their mythology, owing to their philosophical differences. In this place I can only observe, in regard to the Triad, that, according to the Aishwarikas, Buddha is an immaterial principle, (\"bodhan atmika iti Buddha\") the active agent in creation, and the first member of the Triad: Dharma, a material principle (\"dhuran atmika iti Dharma\"), the passive agent in creation, and the second member of the Triad: Sanga, a\nprinciple compounded of the other two (\"Samudaiyatihi iti Sanga\"), the third member of the Triad, and the direct and immediate agent in creation; deriving as well his origin as his powers from the union of the essences of Buddha and Dharma.\n\nThe vulgar system represents Buddha and Dharma as man and wife, and Sanga as their son.\n\n(For Note 2, substitute what follows.)\n\n(2.) Another sloka is here quoted; but it will not entirely justify the palpably Brahmanical language of the text;\u2014in which, moreover, there is, I think, some confusion of the opposite tenets of two discordant sects of the Aishwarikas.\n\nThe doctrine of the one sect, which, as the more approved, is called the right-handed, or Dakshin Achar,\u2014has been stated above: that of the other, which is stigmatised as the left-handed, or Vamachar,\u2014consists in postponing the active principle, Buddha, to the passive principle, Dharma. What the analogous philosophical tenets of these Vamachari Aishwarikas are, I cannot learn, or imagine: for, to postpone mind to matter would seem necessarily to involve a denial of mind as distinct from, and independent of, matter; and such a denial is possibly at the bottom of the Vamachari doctrine; which in that case must be referred to the Swobhavika school. The primitive Swobhavikas do not probably admit the notion of a Triad. With the Prajniku Swobhavikas (also, I believe, designated as Vamichar) Dharma, or Deified Nature, is the first member of the Triad: Buddha, representing the active force of nature, in Pravritti, is the second member: and Sanga the third.\n\nThere is no difference of opinion as to the character or rank of the third member of the Triad, called Sanga, who is universally considered the lowest, and a dependant personage; all agreeing that \"from the union of the essences of Prajna and Upaya (or Upiya and Prajna, according to the Vamacharis) sprang the world, which is Sanga:\" meaning, with the Aishwarikas, a creation properly so called,\u2014with the Swobhavikas, that spontaneous reproduction of forms which results necessarily from the principles of nature, without divine concurrence.\n\nThe triadic doctrine of all the schools is referable solely to Pravritti. In Nirvritti, Sanga vanishes by universal consent: but in regard to the state of the two other members of the Triad there is great discordance of opinions. The Aishwarikas, who admit only one immaterial cause of all things, resolve Dharma, in Nirvritti, into Buddha: while those Aishwarikas who contend that all things proceeded from matter and mind, consider Prajna Upaya as forming a Biunity in Nirvritti. Those again (the Swobhavikas) who hold matter to be the sole substance, and regard Dharma as Diva Natura, reunite Buddha, in the state of Nirvritti, with Dharma, from whom, in the state of Pravritti, he emanated. Thus the Triad of all the schools resolves itself into a Duad; and that of some dwindles into a Monad. The whole notion of a Triad is probably foreign to primitive Buddhism; though it is doubtless of a comparatively remote date, and of wide acceptation. I have found it in Ceylon and in Bh\u00f4t, as well as in Nip\u00e1l: and, I think, also have discovered it in the caves of the West of India.\nAPPENDIX.\n\n(For Note 3, substitute what follows.)\n\n(3.) The Triadic doctrine of the Aishwarikas, as above stated, seems to resolve itself (so far as it is intelligible) merely into gross generative ideas of creation. Some of them, however, had a more refined idea of that grand operation of the Almighty; for they acknowledge a creation resulting from the volition (Dhy\u00e1n) of an immaterial eternal Adi Buddha. The deduction of the five Dhy\u00e1ni Buddhas, and five Dhy\u00e1ni Bodhisatwas, from this Adi Buddha, will be seen farther on. This vague conception of a divine creation is here, in the text, improperly mixed with the generative creations of various Teachers.\n\n(For Note 10, substitute what follows.)\n\n(10.) This limited reply is to be attributed to my friend, and not to his books. Matter is called Prakriti by the Baudhas, as well as by the Brahmanists: and a favourite title of the Supreme Dharma, or Prajna, is Prakriteswari.\n\n(For Note 12, substitute what follows.)\n\n(12.) The \"others,\" here alluded to, are the Swabh\u00e1vikas. Such ideas as I have been enabled to form of their philosophical tenets will be found at pp. 435\u2014440. Vol. XVI. Bengal Asiatic Society's Transactions.\u2014Perhaps I have, in that place, stated too favourably the doctrine of the simple Swabh\u00e1vikas, or party opposed to the Pr\u00e1jnika Swabh\u00e1vikas: and it may at least be surmised, that the former held an eternal revolution of matter (Pravritti) and intelligence (Nirvritti) to be the system of Nature. The Pr\u00e1jnika Swabh\u00e1vikas unitized the powers, or forces, of matter in the state of Nirvritti; and invested that Unity with some of the essential attributes of Godhead, such as Eternity and Infinity. The simple Swabh\u00e1vikas did not unitize the powers of nature in the state of Nirvritti: in which state, dispersed as those powers were, and stripped too as they were of every sensible property of matter, it is no great wonder that they were declared to be lost, and reduced to nothing (S\u00fanyata) by the adversaries of this school; and that the followers of such tenets were, by the Brahmans, called in derision S\u00e1nya-V\u00e1dis. My own impression is, that the Swabh\u00e1vikas, in general, never could have so utterly disregarded the plain sense of the ancient maxim\u2014ex nihilo nil: and, consequently, that their s\u00fanyata must be understood in another sense: for which see Note 20.\n\n(Note 14, modify as follows.)\n\n(14.) Omit the reference at the end, which runs thus, \"see on to Note 15,\" and substitute the words (Vide Bengal Asiatic Society's Transactions) loco citato.\n\n(For Note 15, substitute what follows.)\n\n(15.) The text of my friend alludes in this and what follows to the tenets of the K\u00e1rnikas and Y\u00e1tmikas. A faint sketch of the philosophical dogmas of these schools will be seen in the Bengal Asiatic Society's Transactions, loco citato.\n\n(Note 16, modify as follows.)\n\n(16.) Omit the conclusion of this note, from the words, \"But whose Dhy\u00e1n?\" to the end.\n(For Note 17, substitute what follows.)\n\n(17.) These terms are common to all the schools of Buddha philosophy and theology. Pravritti imports the state in which the forming and changing powers of the Universe (whether considered as of immaterial or material natures, or both, or only the latter) exist, in connexion with that upon which they operate; and by their operation upon which all particular palpable forms, such as compose the matter of our world, and of other superior and inferior worlds, begin to exist, as by the cessation of that operation, or influence, these worlds cease to be. Nirvritti signifies the state in which the elements of all things, (whatever be their nature,) exist abstractedly, and apart from all particular palpable forms, such as the human senses and understanding are cognizant of. Pravritti likewise signifies, in a theological sense, Mundane things and existences; Nirvritti, the opposite.\n\nWith respect to self-conscious and sentient beings, to the state of Pravritti are ascribed immutability, rest, bliss: to the state of Nirvritti, mutability, action, pain. The adversaries of the Swabh\u0101vikas assert that their bliss in Nirvritti is annihilation. As already intimated, I do not think so.\n\nIn a word, Nirvritti means abstraction; Pravritti, concretion. Nirvritti is formed from Nirvan\u2014but Pravritti has no Pravan.\n\n(For Note 25, substitute what follows.)\n\n(25.) Sarv\u0101rth\u0101 Siddha was the name of Sakya, until he had acquired bodhij\u00f1\u0101na, and attained to the rank of a Buddha; when he was called Sakya Sinha, and also Goutama: both which are said to be ancestral names of the race from which he sprang. Sarv\u0101rth\u0101 Siddha derived his birth immediately from the S\u0101kya Vansa; remotely, from the Goutama Vansa. It is generally thought that Sadhodana was a Prince of Magadha, or Bahar. The Buddha books of Nip\u0101l universally call Sakya Sinha the son of Sadhodana Raja and Maya Devi; but they assign Ganga S\u0101gura as the place of his birth. Is anything known of Sadhodana Raja? or of the Sakya Vansa, to which this Raja is said to have belonged? or of the Goutama Vansa, which is affirmed to be the remote stem of the Sakya Vansa? Yas-odra was Sakya\u2019s wife; and Rahula Bhadra his son.\n\nIt is a strange notion of Buchanan\u2019s, that Sakya Sinha and Goutama are different persons. They are unquestionably but two names of the seventh M\u0101ha Y\u0101nik\u0101 Buddha.\nAPPENDIX, No. VI.\n\nREGULATIONS\n\nFOR THE\n\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY\n\nOF\n\nGREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND.\n\n1830.\n\nOF THE OBJECTS OF THE SOCIETY GENERALLY, AND OF ITS MEMBERS.\n\nArticle I.\u2014The Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland is instituted for the investigation and encouragement of Arts, Sciences, and Literature, in relation to Asia.\n\nArticle II.\u2014The Society consists of Resident, Non-resident, Honorary, Foreign, and Corresponding Members.\n\nArticle III.\u2014Members, whose usual place of abode is within the limits of the British Islands, are considered to be Resident.\n\nArticle IV.\u2014Those whose usual abode is not in Great Britain or Ireland, being, however, British subjects, are denominated Non-resident.\n\nArticle V.\u2014Foreigners of eminent rank or situation, or persons who have contributed to the attainment of the objects of the Society in a distinguished manner, are eligible as Honorary Members.\n\nArticle VI.\u2014No person shall be eligible as a Foreign Member who is a\nBritish subject, or whose usual place of residence is in any part of the British dominions in Europe.\n\nArticle VII.\u2014All the Members of the Society, of whatever denomination, Resident, Non-resident, Honorary, Foreign, or Corresponding, must be elected at the General Meetings of the Society, in the manner hereinafter described.\n\nArticle VIII.\u2014Non-resident, Honorary, Foreign, and Corresponding Members, when residing in England, have a right of admission to the meetings of the Society; but are not eligible to its offices.\n\nArticle IX.\u2014The Literary Society of Bombay is from henceforward to be considered an integral part of the Royal Asiatic Society, under the appellation of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nArticle X.\u2014The Bombay Branch Society shall be considered quite independent of the Royal Asiatic Society, as far as regards its local administration and the control of its funds.\n\nArticle XI.\u2014The Members of the Bombay Branch Society, while residing in Asia, shall be Non-resident Members of the Royal Asiatic Society; and when in Europe shall be eligible for election as Resident Members, in the same manner as Honorary Members are elected.\n\nArticle XII.\u2014In like manner, the Members of the Royal Asiatic Society, while residing in Europe, are Non-resident Members of the Bombay Branch Society; but when within the presidency of Bombay shall be eligible as Resident Members, in the manner prescribed by the Regulations of that Society.\n\nArticle XIII.\u2014The United Literary Societies of Madras are from henceforward to be considered an integral part of the Royal Asiatic Society, under the appellation of the Madras Literary Society and Auxiliary of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nArticle XIV.\u2014The Madras Literary Society and Auxiliary of the Royal Asiatic Society shall be considered quite independent of the Royal Asiatic\nSociety, as far as regards its local administration and the control of its funds.\n\nArticle XV.\u2014The Members of the Madras Literary Society and Auxiliary of the Royal Asiatic Society, while residing in Asia, shall be Non-resident Members of the Royal Asiatic Society; and when in Europe, shall be eligible for election as Resident Members, in the same manner as Honorary Members are elected.\n\nArticle XVI.\u2014In like manner, the Members of the Royal Asiatic Society, while residing in Europe, are Non-resident Members of the Madras Literary Society and Auxiliary of the Royal Asiatic Society; but when within the presidency of Madras, shall be eligible as Resident Members, in the manner prescribed by the Regulations of that Society.\n\nMODE OF ELECTING THE MEMBERS.\n\nArticle XVII.\u2014Any person desirous of becoming a Member of the Royal Asiatic Society, Resident or Non-resident, must be proposed by Three or more Members, on a certificate of recommendation, declaring his name and usual place of abode; specifying also such titles and additions as it may be wished should accompany the name in the list of the Society: and one, at least, of the persons proposing such candidate must have personal acquaintance with him.\n\nArticle XVIII.\u2014A Foreign Member must be recommended to the Society by five Members, or more.\n\nArticle XIX.\u2014Every recommendation of a Member proposed for election, whether Resident, Non-resident, Foreign, or Corresponding, shall be read at three successive General Meetings of the Society.
