Shelford ... ... ... page 1\nPART II.\n\nPersonal Ornaments.\n\nBY R. SHELFORD, M. A., F. L. S., etc.\nCurator of the Sarawak Museum.\n\nThis part of the illustrated catalogue treats only of the objects worn for decorative purposes by the natives of Borneo at the present day or in the immediate past, the objects forming no part of an essential body covering or attire. Consequently such articles as caps, hats, jackets or kirtles decorated with beadwork, metal rattles, cowries etc. are not included in this part of the catalogue, they must be catalogued subsequently under some such heading as Dress or Festal Attire. Similarly I have excluded the antique ornaments and fragments of ornaments that are found frequently by native gold-seekers in the headwaters of the Sarawak river and elsewhere in Sarawak and of which there is a small collection in the Sarawak Museum; they all seem to belong to a former civilization merely transitory in Borneo.* An exception has been made in favour of the antique beads of uncertain origin so largely worn in necklets and girdles by the men and women of most Bornean tribes; these are shortly discussed in their proper place in this paper.\n\nThe question of the relationship between magic and personal ornamentation has not been lost sight of and many enquiries on the subject have been set afoot, without, however, eliciting much information of any importance. In face of the facts recorded from other parts of the world, it seems in the highest degree probable that certain ornaments of some Bornean tribes were also endowed once with a magical significance, and it is possible that the restriction of the wearing of certain ornaments at the present day to individuals of a given social\n\n* For an account of and a suggestion as to the origin of some gold ornaments found at Limbang in Northern Sarawak in 1900 see MAN 1903 No. 2. \"Note on a collection of Gold Objects found in Sarawak, in the possession of His Highness the Rajah of Sarawak\" by C. H. Read.\n\nR. A Soc., No. 43, 1905.\nstanding or at certain periods only of their lives* is a relic of magical powers more appreciated in the past than nowadays. As might naturally be expected it is among the more primitive Borneans that ornaments functioning also as charms are met with. Thus, Kalabit youths when visiting new districts wear a necklet of decorative seeds as a charm against evil spirits; Land-Dyak men also wear a necklet of beads and the canines of leopard and bear when away in a strange country, the beads are frequently regarded as charms against specific diseases and the whole ornament is regarded as valuable enough to buy off the wearer's life if that is threatened by spirit or human enemy. The necklet worn by the Land-Dyak female witch-doctors described below is a badge of office and magic resides in the charms attached to the necklet but not in the necklet itself. Kyans and Sea-Dyaks often wear round the wrist a string on which is threaded an antique bead, this is a sign that once the wearer was ill and lost temporarily his vital spark (Samengat), but that subsequently it was recovered, whereupon he or a witch-doctor tied it in with the beaded string to prevent it from escaping again; but this bead can hardly be regarded as an ornament, it is a charm pure and simple and in fact a carpal bone of the mouse deer or even a tatu mark is often substituted for it. These are practically the only examples of \"magical ornaments\" that I have encountered, but a few more references to the restrictions imposed on the wearing of other ornaments will be found scattered throughout the catalogue.\n\nI have been able to arrive at no better classification of Ornaments than the following:\u2014\n\n1. Ornaments worn in the hair and in a head-dress.\n2. Ornaments worn in the ears.\n3. Ornaments worn on the neck.\n4. Ornaments worn on the limbs.\n5. Finger rings.\n6. Ornaments worn round the body.\n7. Buttons and buckles.\n\n*e.g. amongst the Kyans only those who have taken heads are allowed to wear ear-peg made from the canines of the clouded leopard, and amongst the Sea Dyaks only married women are supposed to wear brass corsets.*\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nOrnaments worn in the hair and in a head-dress.\n\nI. Hairpins.\nII. Combs and Tiaras.\nIII. Fillets and Head-bands.\nIV. Head-dress ornaments.\n\nI. HAIRPINS.\n\n1. Murut\u2014\"pleng.\"\n\nThese are flat pointed strips of deer's horn worn by men; Murut men wear their hair long but tie it at the back of the head in a simple knot and the \"pleng\" is passed through the knot to prevent it from becoming untied. Ling Roth (l.c. vol. ii. p. 59) figures two Murut \"pleng\" in Dr. Hose's collection, one of which is very like specimen e described below.\n\ni. Murut of Trusan district.\n\na. 19\u00b75 cm. long, 4\u00b78 cm. broad at the top. A border of simple geometrical design is fretted in the upper end; one side (the front) is fluted with seven shallow longitudinal grooves, on the other side (the back) some rough geometrical and phyllomorphic designs are incised.\n\nFrom the Trusan River. [Pd. 1. xii. 02].\nCatalogue No. 1198. (Plate I. fig. 1, a).\n\nb. 19 cm. long, 4\u00b77 cm. broad at the top. A very narrow border of simple design is fretted in the upper end; the main part of the ornament is occupied by a fretted phyllomorphic design; above and below this on both sides is incised a zone of double-scroll pattern (arit blavit\u2014interlacing); on the back some confused incised lines are mixed up with the fret pattern.\n\nFrom the Trusan River [Pd. 1. xii. 02].\nCatalogue No. 1199 (Plate I. fig. 1, b).\n\nc. 18\u00b73 cm. long, 4\u00b72 cm. broad at the top. The top of the ornament is fretted; a simple phyllomorphic pattern with hatched background is incised on the front, a geometrical design (arit blavit) bounding it above and below.\n\nFrom the Trusan River.

A square projection at the top; the upper third is covered both back and front with tin-foil, a raised line runs down the centre of the front. On the back of the ornament at the top is stuck a lump of dammar, which serves to hold in position a tuft of goat's hair and a few bright blue feathers from the back of the male fairy bluebird *Irena criniger*; in the resinous lump are imbedded a seed of *Adenanthera pavonina* and a piece of shell.\n\nAcquired by exchange 9. iv. 04.\nCatalogue No. 1409.

Nearly the whole of the front of the pin is covered with tin-foil, the apex and a short length in the middle alone being uncovered; the tin-foil is in two pieces, a phyllomorphic design has been fretted in the lower. On the back of the ornament at the top is stuck a lump of dammar which serves to hold a small tuft of goat's hair, and in the resinous lump are embedded two seeds of *Adenanthera pavonina* and a portion of a pale blue bead; just below this a disc of looking-glass is fastened with dammar to the pin.\n\nFrom the Upper Padas, British N. Borneo.\nSir P. F. Cunynghame, Bart. [P. 22. viij. 92].\nCatalogue No. 747. (Plate I. fig. 1, d).\n\ng. 21 cm. long, 6\u00b71 cm. broad at the top. The upper third, both back and front is covered with tin-foil, in front at the top two circular depressions have been ground in the horn and into\n\n*These Tagal are a sub-tribe of the Murut and of course have no affinity with the Philippine Tagalo or Tagal; they dwell in the highlands forming the watershed of the Upper Padas and Upper Trusan rivers.*\nthese have been let two discs of looking-glass; a lump of dammar at the back secures a tuft of goat's hair; two small discs of tin-foil are let into the ornament at the back near the apex, and the back is further decorated with a roughly incised phyllomorphic design.\n\nFrom the Upper Padas, British N. Borneo.\nSir P. F. Cuninghame, Bart. [P. 22. viij. 92].\nCatalogue No. 748. (Plate I. fig. 1, e).\n\n2. Murut\u2014hairpins.\n\nThese are boar's tusks, worn by men in the same way as the \"pleng.\"\n\na. A boar's tusk scraped and ground smooth and white; into the pulp-cavity a tuft of human hair is thrust and secured by dammar. An incised double-scroll design (arit blavit) runs round the base of the tusk. 20\u00b75 cm. measured along the outside curve.\n\nFrom the Trusan River. O. F. Ricketts, Esq, [P. xi. 88].\nCatalogue No. 746. (Plate I. fig. 1, f).\n\nb. A boar's tusk scraped and ground smooth and white; in the pulp-cavity is fixed a plug of wood shaped like the basal portion of a tusk and prolonging the curve of the tusk to which it is fitted; a piece of looking glass is fixed with dammar on to the end of the wooden plug and a rattan plait round the basal portion of the tusk proper prevents the pulp-cavity from splitting open. One side of the tusk is decorated with two incised phyllomorphic designs, the background of the designs, as is usual in Murut fictile art, being filled in with punctures and hatching. 28\u00b72 cm. measured along the outside curve.\n\nFrom the Trusan River. [Pd. ix. 02].\nCatalogue No. 1167. (Plate I. fig. 1, g).\n\n3. Murut(?)\u2014brass hairpins.\n\na. A flat curved strip of brass, shaped like a narrow knife-blade, one end is pointed, the other is broken; the concave border, corresponding to the back of the knife-blade, is perforated throughout about two-thirds of its length with a series of small holes.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 43, 1905.\nLength (in a straight line) 19\u00b76 cm.; greatest breadth 1\u00b73 cm. Hon. C. C. de Crespigny [P. 4. vii. 78].\nCatalogue No. 662 a. (Plate I. fig. 2, a).\n\nb. Very similar to the preceding but larger; one end is pointed, the other is curled up into a flat spiral; there are fewer holes pierced in the concave border, some of them are supplied with brass rings; there is one hole lower down on the convex border.\n\nLength (in a straight line) 23\u00b73 cm.; greatest breadth 1\u00b77 cm. Hon. C. C. de Crespigny [P. 4. vii. 78].\nCatalogue No. 662 b. (Plate I. fig. 2, b).\n\nThese pins are said to be worn by either sex. Their origin seems to be extremely doubtful and this type of hairpin is certainly not known now amongst the Muruts of the Trusan River though, it is quite possible that a former generation used them.\n\n4. Kalabit\u2014\"plin.\"\n\na. A slender pointed steel rod worn by men in the same way as the Murut \"pleng.\" The blunt end for a distance of 6 centim. is twisted into a close spiral.\n\nTotal length 26\u00b72 cm. [Pd. 30. iii. 03].\nCatalogue No. 1258. (Plate I. fig. 2, c).\n\n5. Dusun\u2014\"timbok.\"\n\nSmall metal hairpins worn by women.\n\na. A flat strip of steel, bent into a slight curve; one end (the upper) is broader than the lower, the sides taper gradually. A small hole is bored in the upper end.\n\nLength (in a straight line) 12\u00b75 cm.; breadth (at top) 1\u00b72 cm. From Kiou, British N. Borneo.\nDrs. G. D. and H. A. Haviland coll. [P. v. 92].\nCatalogue No. 759. (Plate I. fig. 2, d).\n\nb. Very similar, but smaller and made of brass, the lower end less pointed. To the hole in the broad end is attached a long (69 centim.) string of common glass beads of European manufacture, the majority are red, a few blue, green, black and white ones being intermixed; the string at its loose end is\nmade fast to a pearl shirt-button from which depend four short strings of similar beads forming a tassel. The hair is tied in a knot on the top of the head, the pin is stuck through it and the bead string is wound round the base of the knot.\n\nLength (in a straight line) 10\u00b79 cm.; breadth at top 0\u00b79 cm. From Kiou, British N. Borneo.\n\nDrs. G. D. and H. A. Haviland coll. [P. v. 92].\n\nCatalogue No. 760. (Plate I. fig. 2, e).\n\nLing Roth (l.c. vol. II. p. 58) figures a silver hairpin from the Baram River (ex. coll. Peek); it is a slender rod with a star-shaped head and I believe it to be of Malay origin and worn by women.\n\nII. COMBS AND TIARAS.\n\n1. Dusun\u2014wooden combs.\n\nThese are worn by women in the knot of hair at the back of the head; * they are usually flat-sided with a long shaped handle (cf. Ling Roth l.c. vol. II. p. 59 and Whitehead, Exploration of Kina Balu, Plate opposite p. 108 fig. X). Whitehead (l.c. fig. IX) figures also a double comb, the teeth springing from each side of a horizontal wooden strip.\n\na. Wooden comb, with nine teeth and an elongated shaped handle; the two flat sides are decorated with geometrical designs painted on with black resin.\n\nTotal length 12 cm. greatest breadth 3\u00b75 cm\n\nFrom N. of Kina Balu. Mr. Steffen [P. vi. 92].\n\nCatalogue No. 783. (Plate VIII. fig. 1).\n\n2. Malay\u2014\"sisir penyu.\"\n\na. A broad curved comb of tortoise shell with numerous teeth; the \"back\" is cut into a scalloped edge. The comb is worn by women at the back of the head just above the knot of hair.\n\nLength (measured along the curve) 14\u00b76 cm.; breadth 4\u00b72 cm.\n\n[Pd. xii. 02].\n\nCatalogue No. 1213. (Plate I. fig. 2, f).\n\n* No magical significance whatever appears to be attached to these combs or to the patterns on them, as is the case with the very similar combs worn by Semang women of the Malay Peninsula.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 43, 1905\n3. Malay\u2014\"sisir.\"\n\na. A silver tiara worn by brides at the marriage ceremony. It consists of a triangular plate of silver, slightly curved; the upper sides of the triangle are scalloped, and a phyllomorphic design is executed in repouss\u00e9 work on its face. To the middle of the back of the tiara are attached by soldering seven long backwardly directed teeth of silver, and at regular intervals along the upper borders are attached at the back nine slender silver sockets into which are fitted spiral wire springs, each bearing at its summit a silver artificial flower with small diamond shaped pendants. From each of the lower angles hangs a chain of pendants cut out of a thin sheet of silver. The tiara is worn on the top of the head and in front. Length (measured along the curve) 18\u00b74 cm, greatest breadth 6\u00b75 cm.\n\n[Pd. 23. i. 03].\n\nCatalogue No. 1220. (Plate I. fig. 3, b).\n\nA somewhat similar ornament is worn high-days and holidays by the more civilized Sea-Dyak women; it was designed by the late F. R. O. Maxwell, Esq., formerly Resident of Sarawak, in response to a request made by some women to invent a new head-gear; for a photograph of a woman wearing this ornament see Ling Roth, l.c. vol. I. p. 4.\n\nMalay brides in the Peninsula wear a rather different form of head-dress for the marriage ceremony. \"The bride's hair is done up in a roll (sunggul) and this is surmounted with a head-dress of artificial flowers (called g'rak g'empa), cut out of p'ra da kresek (\"crackling tinsel\") and raised on five wires; her forehead is bound with a band or fillet of tinsel\u2014gold-leaf (p'ra da Siam) being used by the rich\u2014which is called tekan kundei, and is carried round by the fringe of the hair (gigi rambut) down to the top of each ear (pelipis).\" (Malay Magic, by W. W. Skeat, p. 378). One of these fillets was purchased by Mr. Skeat and is now in the Cambridge Anthropological Museum; it is decorated with a dragon design.\n\nIII. FILLETS AND HEAD-BANDS.\n\nThese are worn by both sexes of a good many tribes; but very few of them, if indeed any, can be rightly classed as orna-\nments; they are rather articles of dress since their principal purpose is to keep the hair in order and out of the eyes. Such are the \"selapok\" of the Sea-Dyaks and the \"lavong\" of the Kyans, plaited bands of rush or split rattan worn by men and the beaded head-bands worn by Kyan, Kenyah and Ukit women (cf. Ling Roth vol. II. p. 59). The Muruts of the Trusan district wear \"strings of beads on the head to as many as six rows; these fit the contour of the head and if continued to the top of the head would form a cap; the hair is smoothed down and the end is brought up and passed through inside the strings of beads, forming a long loop a little to one side of the head\" (O. F. Ricketts in \"Sarawak Gazette\" No. 347 p. 241). The beads composing these fillets are large yellow beads of glass and are highly prized. Murut children of both sexes wear a single string of differently coloured beads round the head, and the Murut women of the Lawas River, British N. Borneo wear a narrow fillet (two or three strings only) of differently coloured beads.\n\nBrooke Low (cf. Ling-Roth l.c. vol. II. p. 58) notes that unmarried girls amongst the Sea-Dyaks wear chaplets of sweet-smelling berries; the chaplets are known as \"balong.\"\n\n1. Kenyah\u2014head-rings.\n\na. Two narrow circles of split rattan, with strips of very finely split rattan, stained black, closely wound round in a vertical direction; on the outside, strips of a yellowish rush are interlaced with the vertical rattan strips, forming a simple pattern of oblique lines in double sets. At one point on each ring a piece of red cloth is wound round and stitched with string.\n\nDiam. 17\u00b75 cm. and 16 cm.; breadth 1\u00b76 cm.\n\nBrooke Low collection. From the Uma Kelap* of the Rejang River.\n\nCatalogue No. 399 a. (Plate VIII. fig. 11).\n\n*Dr. C. Hose considers that these people belong to a division intermediate between the Kalamantar and Kyan-Kenyah divisions.\n\nR. A. Soc. No. 43, 1905.\nIV. HEAD-DRESS ORNAMENTS.\n\n1. Malay\u2014\"tajok.\"\n\na. A pair of ornaments worn on each side of the head-dress by bridegrooms at the marriage ceremony. Each ornament is a branched wire stalk covered with gold thread, to the branches are attached by five wire springs several artificial flowers cut out of gold paper, and a long chain of gold paper pendants hangs from one of the branches.\n\n[Pd. xii. 02].\n\nCatalogue No. 1215. (Plate I. fig. 3, a).\n\nSimilar ornaments though differently named are worn by bridegrooms in the Malay Peninsula. \"His head is adorned with the sigar, a peculiar head-dress of red cloth arranged turbanwise, with a peak on the right-hand side, from which artificial flowers (gunjei) depend, . . . . Besides this head-dress the bridegroom has a small bunch of artificial flowers (suntung-suntung) stuck behind each ear, whilst two similar bunches are stuck in the head-dress (one on the right and the other on the left).\" (Malay Magic, by W. W. Skeat p. 379. Plate 12. Fig. 1).\n\n2. Land Dyak\u2014\"sanggur mabok.\"\n\na. A tuft of aromatic leaves, \"daun mabok\" ('Acorus sp.) bound on to a short wooden stick with a strip of red cloth. Sometimes worn in the head-dress by young men.\n\nFrom Piching, Upper Sadong (Menggrat sub-tribe) [Pd. viij. 03].\n\nCatalogue No. 1302.\n\nSea-Dyak women are fond of wearing flowers in their hair or head-dresses; men's caps are frequently decorated with the tail-feathers of hornbills or the quills of the argus pheasant. Ling-Roth figures (l. c. vol. II. p. 60) a remarkable conoidal cap, in the collection of the British Museum, carrying in the centre of the crown a plume 21 ins. high of small downy white feathers attached to slips of bamboo; a very similar cap, though unprovided with a plume, worn by the Land-Dyaks of Sambas, Dutch Borneo, has recently been presented to the Sarawak Museum by Mr. E. W. Byrde.\nOrnaments worn in the ears.\n\nI. Earrings of metal.\nII. Ear-drops of metal or stone, or single beads.\nIII. Earrings of brass and brass-wire.\nIV. Ear-pendants of brass and brass-wire.\nV. Ear-pendants of bead-work.\nVI. Ear-pendants of horn and bone.\nVII. Ear-peggs.\nVIII. Ear-studs and ear-plugs.\n\nI. EARRINGS OF METAL.\n\nUnder the first heading are included the heavy metal rings or coils worn by both sexes of the Ukit, Maloh, Tanjong, Kanowit, Kenyah, Kyan and allied tribes and by Sea-Dyak men; the weight of metal worn by the women of the first mentioned tribes is so great that the lobe of the ear in course of time becomes an immensely elongated loop, through which sometimes the head can actually be passed. Pictures of women with these elongated ear-lobes may be found in most books written on Borneo.* The ear is bored when the subject is two or three years old, in the case of a boy the lobe of the ear is extended by heavy weights to about two or three inches in length, i.e. nearly to the shoulder, when a lighter earring is substituted and the elongation is carried no further; with girls the extension of the ear-lobe is carried still further and the heavy earrings are worn throughout the lifetime; occasionally the loop breaks under the strain and though it may be stitched up again, the unequal length of the two loops is always regarded as a great disfigurement. Amongst Kyans and Kenyahs the ear-lobes must first be extended with tin weights\n\n* e.g. Ling Roth. l.c. vol. I. pp. 25, 27, 28, vol II. p.67 (the women figured on pp. 25, 27, 28 are Tanjongs not Kanowits); Beccari, \"Nelle Foreste in Borneo\" p. 425; Nieuwenhuis, \"In Centraal Borneo\" Pl. XIII. Pl. LVI; several plates in Furness, \"Home Life of Borneo Head-Hunters.\" Nieuwenhuis (l.c.pl. II) also figures a Bukit man with two ear-studs and very heavy earrings such as are usually worn by women only but the ear-lobes in this subject are not much elongated.\n\nR. A Soc., No. 43, 1905.\nas it is supposed that brass weights applied to children's ears will cause the ears to become diseased and to break under the strain. Amongst such tribes as the Tanjong and Tring it is not unusual for the ear, in addition to the large perforation, to be bored in three other places, viz. at the top of the ear-couch and at the proximal end of each limb of the loop formed by the extension of the large perforation in the ear lobe; a finely beaded string is sometimes wound through one or more of the three smaller perforations. Carl Bock gives (Head-Hunters of Borneo p. 186) the following measurements of the ear of a Tring woman:\u2014\"Total length, 7\u00b71 inches; length of slit, 4\u00b775 inches; distance between level of chin and bottom of ear 2\u00b785 inches.\" Sea-Dyak men do not have the ear lobe very much elongated, perhaps to no more than one inch; the fashion of these earrings has been borrowed by this imitative tribe from the Kyans and Kenyahs.\n\nCarl Bock (l.c. p. 67) gives the following account of the manufacture of these ornaments:\u2014\"Taking a long, straight piece of bamboo, the hollow of which was the same diameter as it was intended that the earrings should be, he fixed on the top of it the half of a cocoanut shell with a hole bored through in which the upper end of the cane was inserted, the whole forming a tube with a cup at the top. Wrapping the tube in a cloth, he melted the tin in a small ladle and poured it into the cocoanut cup, till the tube was filled. When the tin was cool he opened the bamboo tube and took out a long straight round rod of tin, which he then bent round a thick but smooth piece of wood, forming a ring with the ends not quite meeting.\" Other methods which are noted below are employed for rather different types of earrings.\n\n1.

(Plate II. fig. 5, c).\n\nThese large light earrings constitute a different type to the heavier twisted earrings described under heading 1. A very similar form is worn by the Milikin, a somewhat anomalous tribe living on the Gedong River, a tributary of the Sadong.\n\nLing-Roth (l.c. vol. II. p. 67) figures two ears, one with one earring like that described above suspended in the elongated ear-lobe, the other with two such earrings and an ear-peg; the legend under the figure is \"Ears of Natives [? Dusuns] At Gunong Tabor or Panti River (E. Borneo) (After Mr. F. S. Marryat).\" These are certainly not the ears of Dusuns, who do not wear ear-pegs or extend the ear-lobes, but of some Kyan or allied tribe. The Panti River it may be noted is not in a Dusun district.\n\nOn pp. 31 and 32 of vol. I. of his book on Borneo natives Ling Roth also figures after Lieut. F. S. Marryat some Saghais from S. E. Borneo with pendulous ear lobes in which hang\nlarge penannular earrings of (?)tin. The sketches are rather fanciful and I suspect that the Saghai are only a Kyan sub-tribe, comparable to the Long Wai, etc.\n\nA. W. Nieuwenhuis in \"In Centraal Borneo\" figures (Pl. XCIII) a Long Gilat girl wearing earrings like No. 115 but quite twice their diameter; in the same work are also figured (Pl. LXII and Pl. LXXXVI) Kyan boys at Blo\u00eb\u00eb with penannular earrings of this type. Carl Bock (l. c. Pl. 10) figures a Long Wahou man with similar earrings.\n\n3. Bakatan and Sea-Dyak\u2014ear-ornaments of tin (worn by men).\n\nThese ornaments are not rings, but they are nevertheless included under the heading I. as they are made from cylindrical lengths of tin cast in a bamboo mould; the tin is not bent into a ring nor into one turn of a spiral, but into a long loop, the ends of which are curled up to form small flat spirals, whilst other ornamentations may be added. A remarkable gold ornament found in August 1902 by gold-seekers in river gravel at Pankalan Ampat, Sarawak river, is figured on Plate III. fig. 6, d, for purposes of comparison. Whether this ornament is indeed an ear-pendant is not very certain, but it is singularly like the Bakatan ear-ornaments; it is possibly of Hindoo origin, and certainly not a product of indigenous handicraft.\n\ni.

EARRINGS OF BRASS WIRE.\n\nThese are series of penannular graduated rings of flattened brass wire worn round the margin of the ear conch by Sea-\nDyak men only amongst the Sarawak tribes. When the ornaments are discarded, as during a time of mourning, the perforations in the ear-cartilage are kept open with little plugs of wood. The fashion is not nearly so widespread as it was some years ago. The Dusuns of Mount Dulit [?\u2014Dalit] * according to Witti (quoted by Ling Roth l.c. vol. II. p. 71) \"have earrings which dangle one below another, all three of brass wire coiled into a spiral. The lowermost is fixed into the ear-lobe and is $2\\frac{1}{2}$ inches in diameter; the two smaller ones are fixed into the margin of the ear.\" This is the only reference that I can find to this type of ornament amongst the Dusuns and I have seen no specimens. The Muruts according to St. John \"wear many rings of lead up the rim of the ear,\" and the Land-Dyaks of Sauh, Serambo and Singgi according to Denison wear earrings of \"wire twisted round in a coil and hanging from the ear by single bend of the same,\" they are known as shibu.\n\n1. Sea-Dyak\u2014\"grunjong.\"\n\nThere are three varieties of the \"grunjong\":\u2014A. \"grunjong tampil\" or \"grunjong ikat;\" B. \"grunjong buri;\" C. \"grunjong.\" The former are series of penannular rings, thirty to forty or fifty in number, strung closely together on a double thread; only a few holes are bored in the ear to hold these rings, in fact one hole at the top of the ear and one in the lobe is quite enough, the intervening rings of the series merely gripping the ear margin. The \"grunjong buri\" are separate penannular brass wire rings on which are strung ground-down cowry shells. From six to twenty can be worn on one ear; since the rings are not connected with each other, a separate hole in the ear-margin has to be bored for each ring. The Ulu Ai and Engkari Dyaks are said to be the only people who wear the \"grunjong buri.\" The \"grunjong\" pure and simple are merely separate penannular rings of brass wire or tin worn like the \"grunjong buri.\" Figures of Sea-Dyaks wearing \"grunjong\" are given by Ling Roth l.c. vol. I. pp. 3, 5, 11.\n\n* This cannot be the Mt. Dulit in the Baram District.\n\nJour, Straits Branch\nA. \"grunjong tampil\" or \"grunjong ikat.\"\n\na. A pair of ear-ornaments; each one composed of a series of thirty-nine pennanular rings of brass wire, filed flat on the inner side. They are graduated in size, the uppermost ring of each series being 2\u00b71 cm. in diameter, the lowest 4\u00b74 cm. The ends of the rings are turned back and through the loops so formed a double string is threaded; the rings are all threaded close together\u2014being only separated from each other by knots in the string\u2014so that each one overlaps the next below it.\n\nBrooke Low collection. From the Lamanak River.\nCatalogue No. 131.\n\nb. Very similar to the preceding, but with only thirty-five rings, the smallest 1\u00b78 cm. in diameter, the largest 5\u00b71 cm. The last and largest ring is flat on both sides and to notches in its lower border are attached by small links of brass wire a row of twenty flat diamond-shaped brass pendants; the central pendant is bifurcated and to it is attached a double chain of diamond-shaped pendants. To every third ring of the series is attached by a sliding wire link a diamond-shaped pendant. The rings are not only joined together by a doubled string passing through the loops formed by the turned-back ends of the rings with a knot between each ring, but also by the string passing back outside the loops with a hitch round every ring.\n\nBrooke Low collection. From the Sakarang River.\nCatalogue No. 598. (Plate IV. fig. 8, b).\n\nc. Very similar to the last, but with forty-three rings, the smallest 1\u00b77 cm. in diameter, the largest 4\u00b72 cm.

A pair of ear pendants worn by men in festal dances. Each is a thin disc of brass; a circular hole has been cut very eccentrically in this disc, so that at one point only a narrow strip of brass is left; this has been split, leaving two overlapping strips which clip the ear-lobe. Several small holes are punched in the border of the disc and a fine silver-wire plait attached to these nearly encircles the disc, just stopping short of the ear-clips.\nFrom the Menggrats of Piching, Upper Sadong River [Pd. viii. 03].\n\nCatalogue No. 1306. (Plate II. fig. 5, f).\n\nSmall silver coins of the Netherlands India currency are frequently attached by silver wire chains to the plait encircling these discs. I was informed that the ornaments are almost obsolete now.\n\n2. Sea-Dyak\u2014\"langgu tingga.\"\n\na. A pair of ear-pendants worn by men. Each consists of twelve graduated penannular rings of brass wire filed flat on the inside and of two broad flat penannular bands cut from a sheet of brass. The ends of all these are joined together by a thick luting of dammar; the smallest brass wire ring tops the series, the flat bands are terminal; all are further held together by two transverse brass wire clips. The front faces of the terminal brass bands are adorned with a simple wedge pattern, incised, known as \"puchok rebong\" i.e. shoots of bamboo; their lower borders are notched and to the teeth of the lower one are attached by brass wire links twenty-seven flat pointed pendants of brass, and to the central pendant of the row is attached a flat notched and bifurcated pendant from which hang two short chains of pointed pendants.\n\nLength 9\u00b75 cm.; diameter of lower flat band 7\u00b74 cm.\n\nBrooke Low collection. From the Sakarang River.\n\nCatalogue No. 600 a.\n\nThis is worn clipped to the ear-lobe, but it is a full-dress ornament and not much affected except by young dandies; according to Brooke Low they are sometimes worn in addition to the \"grunjong.\" There is a very good figure of a \"langgu tingga\" in Ling Roth's book (l.c. vol. II. p. 66).\n\n3. Sea-Dyak \"kenawieng.\"\n\na. A pair of ear-pendants worn by men. Each is a flat brass penannular band from which hang chains of flat pendants, but the two are not quite identical. The ends of the brass penannular bands are bound with cloth; one band is 5 cm. in diameter, twenty-one holes are punched in its rim and two circular lines are incised on its front face; to seven of the holes are\nattached by brass wire links single flat pendants of different shapes and three short strings of small pendants whose lower ends are connected to a flat cross-piece of brass; from five processes of this hang five strings of small flat pendants, two being short and three long; the central long one carries a cross-piece from five lower processes of which also hang five flat diamond-shaped pendants. The other ornament of the pair has the brass band only 4\u00b71 cm. in diameter, and eleven holes punched in its rim, a slender chain replaces the central string of pendants described above.\n\nBrooke Low collection.

A pair of ear-pendants worn by women (? in festal dances); each is a short strip of bead-work 5\u00b71 cm. \u00d7 3\u00b72 cm. with a bead-fringe; every strand of the fringe is terminated by a little piece of red-flannel (cf. Ling Roth I, c. vol. II. p. 73). The beads are small common European ones in several colours. I have no information as to the manner in which these pendants are attached to the ears.\n\nBrooke Low collection.\nCatalogue No. 413.\n\nVI. EAR-PENDANTS OF HORN.\n\nKenyah men, chiefly of the sub-tribes Leppu Tau, Tepu, Leppu Aga, and Uma Lisan, wear an ear-pendant, such as that described below, in one ear, the other ear may carry a different sort of pendant or may be devoid of ornament altogether; the pendants are never worn in pairs.\n\n1.

S. Douglas Esq. [P. 28. iii. 00].\n\nCatalogue No. 1068 b.\n\nVII. EAR-PEGS.\n\nEar-peggs (udang) are worn by men of the Ukit, Punan, Kanowit, Tanjong, Skapan, Kenyah, Kyan and allied tribes; some Sea-Dyaks also have quite recently adopted the same ornament. The udang are either the canines of the clouded leopard, *Felis nebulosa* or imitations of these, carved from the casque of the solid-billed hornbill, *Rhinoptax vigil*. Amongst the Kyans and Kenyahs the leopard\u2019s teeth can only be worn by men who have taken heads and the pegs made from the hornbill casque only by chiefs. The pegs are thrust through large holes, punched with a sharpened section of bamboo, in the upper part of the ear-conch and are usually worn with the points directed downwards and slightly outwards; as a rule only one is worn in each ear, but Brooke Low (cf. Ling Roth l.c. vol. II. p. 69) states that the Uma Lesong wear two teeth in each ear, the upper one pointing upwards, the lower one downwards. Figures of natives wearing ear-peggs may be found in Ling Roth\u2019s book) vol. I. pp. 12, 14, 19, 23). When these ornaments are not in use* the lobes in the ears are filled with a plug of wood or a pledget of cloth or tobacco.\n\n*A Kenyah chief of the Baram River, Tama Bulan by name, when on a visit to Kuching some years ago, never wore his ear-peggs; when asked the reason, he replied that the evil spirits would recognise him by his ear-peggs and seeing him so far from his home would hasten there themselves and wreak their wicked will on all his people and belongings; without his ear-peggs he was practically disguised or at least unrecognisable.\n\nR.

The necklet is fastened by a piece of wood at the end of a string buttoned into a string loop.\n\nFrom Kiou, British N. Borneo.\nDrs. G. D. and H. A. Haviland coll. [P. v. 92].\nCatalogue No. 773.\n\nWhitehead (l.c. Plate opposite p. 108. fig. XIII) figures a somewhat similar specimen.\n\nLing Roth (l.c. p. vol. II. p. 73.) figures a Sea-Dyak necklace of sections of reed strung on European thread, the ends joined by two loops of lead wire; the necklace is in the collection of Rev. F. W. Leggatt. Necklets of plaited vegetable fibre, like the armlets and leglets of the same material (vide infra) do not seem to be worn by any tribe.\n\nKalabit youths when visiting a strange country wear a necklet of seeds as a charm against sickness and evil spirits.\n\nII. TEETH NECKLETS.\n\nThese are worn only by Land-Dyak men, at festivals and formerly when on the war-path or when visiting strange districts. The most valued specimens are composed entirely of the canines of *Felis nebulosa* strung on rattan. They are worth about or over $50; more commonly the canines of the honey-bear *Ursus malayanus* are employed with some small pig's tusks intermixed, but even these are very expensive. The Sarawak Museum specimen a, described below, is the only one of its kind known to me. The necklets are known as *bobot* and are worn with the points of the teeth directed upwards (cf. Beccari, Nelle Foreste in Borneo, Figs. 24 and 27).\n\n1. Land-Dyak\u2014\"bobot.\"\n\na. Forty silver imitation teeth and six canine teeth of a small carnivore (? *Felis bengalensis*) strung on a double rattan thread; the silver \"teeth\" are hollow and filled with dammar,\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 43, 1905.\nthey are shaped like the canines of *Felis nebulosa*, the largest ones (6 cm. in length) are in the middle and decrease in size towards the ends; at the ends are situated the six small canine teeth. Between each \"tooth\" occurs a dark blue glass bead, cylindrical in shape and about 7 mm. in diameter, they are strung on one of the threads traversing the \"teeth\" and serve to keep them at equal distances apart. In order to conceal the threading of the \"teeth\" and beads, a plaited band of split rattan is laid over the bases of the \"teeth\" in front of the necklet and three strips of split rattan serve the same purpose at the back; attached by wire to the plaited band is a row of small oval pieces of silver. The whole necklet is bent into an oval and is fastened by ordinary string.\n\nFrom Selakau near Lundu, Sarawak. [Pd. v. 02).\n\nCatalogue No. 1156. (Plate II. fig. 4, a).\n\nb. Necklet of sixty-nine teeth strung on a double rattan thread; sixteen of the teeth are human molars, premolars and incisors, the remainder are the canines of the honey-bear, with one or two very small pig's tusks intermixed. The teeth are all strung close together and to keep all taut the double rattan thread is lashed by a long coil of split rattan to a strip of split rattan laid over the bases of the teeth. To conceal the threading of the teeth a strip of brass is laid over the bases of the teeth on the opposite side to the split rattan strip and is secured with lashings of wire and split rattan. The whole necklet is bent into a circle of 20\u00b77 cm. diameter.\n\nFrom Krokong, Upper Sarawak.\n\nCatalogue No. 1445. E. W. Byrde Esq. [P. viii. 04].\n\nReferences to similar necklets will be found in Ling Roth's work (l.c. vol. II. p. 73).\n\nThese necklets are considered of such value that the owners are prepared to offer them in exchange for their lives if threatened by either supernatural or human enemies. The beads which are interspersed with the canines often have powerful magical properties.\nIII. BEAD NECKLETS.\n\nBead necklets are worn by both sexes of every tribe.\n\nThe beads from which the necklets and girdles in the Sarawak Museum are made may be grouped under eleven headings, and in order to avoid much circumlocution and repetition in the descriptions of the necklets and girdles given below, the component beads will be referred to, as a rule, merely by their respective group numbers:\n\nNative-made beads.\n\nType 1. Quartz crystals, bored.*\nType 2. Cornelian and agate pebbles, ground and bored.*\nType 3. Columellae of shells and shell discs.\nType 4. Brass wire wound into the shape of a long bead.\u2020\n\nImported beads.\n\nType 5. Small glass and glazed clay beads of different colours, ranging in size from 2 mm. in diameter to 4 mm.; of quite modern European manufacture and importation.\nType 6. Large glass beads of different colours, generally spherical but sometimes with flat faces, sometimes cylindrical. Some of these are antique.\nType 7. Modern glass beads of Venetian make, ovoid in shape, of different colours with crude designs in other colours roughly painted over them. About 5 mm. in diam.\nType 8. Small discoid glazed clay beads, yellow or pale blue in colour, known as labang. Antique specimens are valued at $1 apiece. About 4\u00b78 mm. in diam. Supposed to be of Venetian origin.\n\n* Some of these beads are bored locally by the pump-drill.\n\u2020 Made by the Malohs (cf. Ling Roth l.c. Vol. II. p. 73); there are no specimens in the Sarawak Museum.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 43, 1905\nType 9. Spherical glazed clay beads of different colours, ranging in size from 6 mm. in diam. to 13 mm. Some specimens are antique and are very highly valued. They * are supposed to be of Venetian origin.\n\nType 10. Cylindrical Venetian beads of glazed clay or glass, generally black or dark blue in colour, with four rosettes painted in different colours though generally in red and yellow on them. (Plate VIII. fig. 5). Some specimens are striped longitudinally, others have sinuous lines on them. The generic term for these beads is lukut, but almost every specimen has a distinctive name, such as mata tiong (mynah's eye), lukut puni (pigeon bead), lukut telingan (hornbill bead), lukut kelum bla (striped bead). Antique specimens have high values placed on them, $10 is quite a usual price. The usual size is 15 mm. in length by 5 mm. in diam.\n\nType 11. Similar to the above but much larger and generally spherical. Diam. about 20 mm. Antique specimens are valued very highly; one form known as lukut sekala is worth as much as $100 amongst the Kyans. (Plate VIII. figs. 6, 7, 8, 9).\n\nThe owners of antique beads of Types 9, 10, 11 consider them to be of vast antiquity, and, in many cases, of supernatural origin; they have been handed down from one generation to another so that the date of their importation is now buried in some obscurity. Tribes other than the Kyans do not attach so much value or importance to these antique beads, and any in the possession of Sea-Dyaks have probably been looted from Kyans. Kyans have definite names and definite values for every form of antique bead, and they form part of their currency.\n\nAntique examples of Type 10 are better finished and have a larger bore than modern imitations and the Kyans are wonderfully acute in distinguishing between the two.\n\n*Weathered specimens exhibit a spiral structure; apparently the clay when wet was twisted in short lengths round a rod, then shaped roughly into the form of a bead and baked; the final polishing and shaping taking place after the clay was fired.\n1. Murut\u2014\"bani.\"\n\n   a. Necklet worn by women; it is composed of nine cornelian pebbles roughly ground into flat ovals and of twenty-nine beads of Type 9, yellow, red, (dara brak, pig's blood), pale blue (bunan) and black with coloured spots. All are threaded on a double thread, the cornelian pebbles are perforated longitudinally by two holes through which the two strings pass. The diameter of the beads ranges from 13 mm. to 9 mm.\n\n   From the Trusan district. [Pd. 2. xii. 02].\n\n   Catalogue No. 1195. (Plate II. fig. 4, b).\n\n   Ling Roth (l.c. Vol. I. p. 213) figures a portion of an Undup (Sea-Dyak) cornelian and bead necklace.\n\n2. Land-Dyak\u2014\"pangia.\"\n\n   These are necklets worn by the married women and female witch-doctors (borich) of Upper Sarawak. Charms, that are supposed to be effective in healing disease, in inducing good harvests, etc., are always attached to the necklets. They are worn by married women at festivals, for three months following childbirth, except during the first week, and for three months after the death of a husband; by the borich they are worn almost constantly, invariably at festivals and magic ceremonies. (For an account of the Land-Dyak witch-doctors cf. Ling Roth Vol. I. p. 259 et. seq.). About 50% of the women in the village of Krokong, Upper Sarawak, are borich.\n\n   a. Necklet consisting of eight rows of differently coloured beads (likich) of Type 5, 3 to 4 mm. in diameter, strung on finely split rattan threads; the rows are bound together side by side by ten transverse loopings of brass wire so as to form a flat band of concentric rows; the free ends of the rattan strings are made fast to a row of five Chinese cash bound together by string (toli), these lie flat on the back of the neck of the wearer. The differently coloured beads are arranged in thirteen definite transverse divisions; starting from one end the arrangement of colours is:\u2014blue and black mixed (sougot), yellow (siah), red (biliah), opaque white (morpu), blue and black mixed, opaque white, transparent white (tagi), with a few\ngreen and red beads at each end of the division, opaque white, blue and black mixed, opaque white, red, yellow, blue and black mixed. The outermost row however is made up of rather different beads with flat faces, pink, white and pale green in colours, and they are not arranged in any definite order. The brass wire loopings mark the junctions of all the divisions except the junction between the blue, black and yellow divisions. The arrangement and number of colours is said to vary with every village, and the number of bead rows varies from five to ten. From the band of Chinese cash depends a string loop on which are strung some charms; these are as follows:\n\n1. An incisor of a porcupine (bidiak).\n2. A canine of a wild cat.\n3. A claw of the scaly manis (oomb).\n4. A claw of the Brahminy kite (libau).\n5. A ring of coconut shell (boru butan).\n6. Five small brass rattles of European make (boman).\n7. Three cast brass rattles (prosi').\n8. Two quartz crystals enclosed in brass wire lashings (penoah).\n9. Several differently coloured beads of Types 5 and 6 (likich).\n\nThe only information that I have about these charms is, that if the quartz crystals are dipped in water and the water allowed to drip from them on to a poisoned wound such as is caused by a venomous snake, scorpion or centipede, the wound becomes cold and the poison eventually will depart from it. Doubtless each one of the charms has specific properties; they are always suspended from the necklet. Circumference of necklet 69 cm., width 2\u00b78 cm.\n\nFrom Krokong, Upper Sarawak.\n\nE. W. Byrde, Esq. [P. 8. ii. 04].\n\nCatalogue No. 1402. (Plate II. fig. 4, c).\n\nMr. E. W. Byrde, to whom I am indebted for most of the information given above, has in his own collection a less elabor-\nated example of the \"pangia,\" but these two are the only specimens that I have ever seen. At the village of Lanchang, Upper Sadong, all the guests at a feast given in my honour by one of the head-men of the village were sprinkled with water from a basin, the sprinkler being a necklace of a different nature to the \"pangia;\" owing to the supposed magical properties of this necklace I was unable to buy it and I was not allowed to examine it very closely.\n\n3. Sea-Dyak\u2014\"kong-kong rekong.\"\n\nBead-necklets worn by adults and children of both sexes.\n\na. Necklet composed of a single string of beads of Type 5, about 3 mm. in diameter, red, yellow, black and white in colour. A few small cast brass rattles are attached to the necklet at one point. The necklet forms a complete loop without a fastening.\n\nBrooke Low collection.\nCatalogue No. 414.\n\nAccording to a note by Brooke Low necklets of this character are given by young men to girls as a token of betrothal, but a Sea-Dyak chief from the Rejang River who recently visited the Sarawak Museum ridiculed this statement; however, amongst the Kyans a girl will give a bead necklet to a man to whom she considers herself betrothed so that it is quite probable that Brooke Low's statement is correct.\n\nb. necklet composed of a single string of beads of Type 9 about 6 mm. in diameter; the majority are pale blue in colour,* but a few are white and white and black; all are much weathered. In addition to these beads there are three quartz crystal beads with ground faces, seven cornelian beads (Kyan name *akit) of varying shapes and sizes and one bead of Type 10 white in colour with some pale yellow zigzag lines, known to Kyans as *bahu tulang* and valued at about $5.\n\n---\n\n* The pale blue beads are much affected by Kalabits and Muruts and are known to the former as *bahu bata*, they are worth about 50 cents apiece.\n\nR.A.Soc.

Vol. II. p. 74).\n\nThe scarlet *saga* (*Adenanthera pavonina*) seeds frequently replace the ground cowries of the specimens described above.\n\nSomewhat similar shell armlets known as *rangke* are worn by Sea-Dyak women, on high-days and holidays but they are smaller and less carefully finished, eight to twelve are worn on each arm. Ling Roth (l. c. Vol. I. p. 20). Figures a Sea-Dyak (wrongly labelled Kanowit) girl wearing these ornaments.\n\nThe Land-Dyak women of the Upper Sadong and Upper Sarawak (left-hand branch) rivers wear shell armlets, (*rupak*) alternating with coils of brass wire; the fashionable number is four to each arm, one round the biceps, one just above the elbow, one round the middle of the fore-arm and one round the wrist; these armlets are purchased from Chinese traders for about $5 apiece, they are always quite plain and about 4 cm. in depth; armlets of porcelain are sometimes substituted for the shell armlets, a specimen in the Canterbury Museum is figured by Ling Roth (l. c. Vol. II. p. 74)\n\nQuite a recent importation are the series of slender rings of celluloid worn on the fore-arm by Sea-Dyak men; the armlets are made in Europe and cost about $10 a set; the rings are threaded together by string. Similar armlets but made of ivory are worn by Kenyah women.\n\nIV. ARMLETS AND LEGLETS OF RATTAN AND BRASS ANNULI.\n\nThese ornaments, known as \"engkrimu\" are worn by Sea-Dyak men only and according to Brooke Low chiefly by the Sakarang and Lamanak sub-tribes.\n\n1. Sea-Dyak\u2014\"engkrimu.\"\n\n   a. A set of leglets worn by men; the set consists of four series of graduated rings of split rattan strands on to which are threaded numerous small brass annuli; one series consists of\neleven rings, one of thirteen rings and two of twelve rings; the rings of each series are kept together by three brass wires which transfix each ring; the front of every ring is marked by three annuli of rattan stained black, with three annuli stained red on each side, two brass annuli intervening; when all the rings are in position on the leg the effect is produced of a slender black line running down the middle of the front of the series with a red line on each side; two series of rings are worn on each leg, the upper series is worn with the largest ring at the bottom, the lower series with the largest ring at the top, so that the two together fit over the bulge of the calf.\n\nDiam. of largest ring 11\u00b75 cm.; of smallest 9\u00b71 cm.\nBrooke Low collection.\nCatalogue No. 134. (Plate V. fig. 11, d).\n\nb. Seven rings of split rattan strands bound together by a wrapping of a narrow strip of rattan cuticle stained red with dragon's blood and a strip stained black with indigo; several brass annuli are threaded on each ring. Worn on the arms.\n\nDiam. of largest ring 9\u00b76 cm.; of smallest 7\u00b71 cm.\nBrooke Low collection.\nCatalogue No. 139.\n\nV. ARMLETS AND LEGLETS OF BRASS WIRE.\n\nThese are coils of brass wire and sets of brass wire rings. The Sea-Dyak term for both varieties is selong, though as a rule it is applied only to leglets, whilst the terms for armlets are tumpa selong or tumpa belit and tumpa gurang, the former being applied to the wire coils, the latter to the sets of separate rings. Sea-Dyaks assert that the separate wire rings are of a comparatively modern date having been introduced amongst them by the Malohs of Kapuas. Women wear both brass coils and separate brass rings on the arms and legs, but men wear neither on the legs and rarely wear brass coils on the arms. The ornaments are not in every day use but are only assumed on high-days, holidays or other special occasions. A figure of a Sea-Dyak girl with her legs covered from the knees to the ankles\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 43, 1905.\nwith a graduated brass wire coil is given by Ling Roth (l. c. Vol. I. p. 21); the men do not wear brass wire leg-ornaments to such an extent, but cover the arms with brass wire separate rings. The Land-Dyak women of the Upper Sadong and Upper Sarawak (left-hand branch) rivers always wear a coil of brass wire (*surin*) on the legs from below the knee to just above the ankle, the coils are wound very tightly round the leg and in course of time considerable distortion of the calf of the leg is produced; even small girls of 7 or 8 years of age are burdened with quite a considerable weight of metal. Coils of brass wire alternating with shell armlets (cf. p. ) are worn on the arms from below the shoulder to the wrist. Land-Dyak men of the Sauh, Serambo and Singgi districts wear armlets of brass wire coils at festivals. Dusun women wear a coil of brass wire round the wrists and round the ankles, also separate rings.\n\n1. **Dusun\u2014armlet.**\n\n   *a.* Ring of brass wire worn as a bracelet by women.\n   \n   Diam. 6\u00b77 cm.\n   \n   R.

(Plate V. fig. 11, e).\n\n*According to Brooke Low these incised rings are known as *tenklai* but *gurang kinkueng* is probably their correct name (vide infra).*\nb. Three penannular rings of brass wire worn as armlets by men; two have simple geometrical patterning incised on their outer border, one is twisted.\n\nDiam. 6\u00b77 cm.; 7\u00b71 cm.; 7 cm. (twisted specimen).\n\nBrooke Low collection.\n\nCatalogue No. 604.\n\nA Rejang Sea-Dyak informed me that *tumpa glos* was the name for these ornaments in his district; in the Batang Lupar River *glos* is equivalent to the Malay *galang*, or bracelet, and the term is applied to the silver bracelets worn by Balau and Sebuyau women.\n\n3. Sea-Dyak\u2014\"tumpa s\u00eblong.\"\n\nTwo coils of brass wire worn as armlets by women; the wire of one coil at one end is notched on the outside (*kinkieng*).\n\nBrooke Low collection.\n\nCatalogue No. 132.\n\nIn Brooke Low's catalogue these are entered as *gurangor tumpa selong*; *gurangor*, means unfinished bracelets, leglets or armlets.\n\n4. Sea-Dyak\u2014\"s\u00eblong.\"\n\na. Six penannular rings of brass wire worn round the ankles by women; two are quite plain, four are notched or punched on the outside. According to Brooke Low these anklets are \"given to those called on to feed the gods on feast-days,\" but a Sea-Dyak chief from the Rejang River scouted this statement; the same informant gave as the name of these ornaments *s\u00eblong kinkieng.*\n\nDiam. 11\u00b74 cm. to 9\u00b72 cm.\n\nBrooke Low collection.\n\nCatalogue No. 137.\n\n*Kinkieng* means notches, the term applies to the rings with the outside notched and punched.\n\nR.

Sea-Dyak\u2014\"tumpa sidieng.\"\n\na. A pair of brass bracelets worn by women; each is a broad penannular band incised on the outer surface with a simple geometrical design known as *puchok rebong*, i.e. bamboo shoots. From the Engkari sub-tribe.\n\nBreadth 4\u00b78 cm.; diam. 5\u00b78 cm.\n\nBrooke Low collection.\nCatalogue No. 395. (Plate V. fig. 10, d).\n\n2. Sea-Dyak\u2014\"gerang giring.\"\n\na. Two pairs of brass anklets worn by women. Each anklet is a tube of thick brass bent into a penannular ring; the tube is somewhat elliptical in section; the outer border of the tube is split by a broad slit which runs almost from one end to the other, the ends however are for a short distance closed in; in the tube run five or six spheres of brass which make a jangling noise whenever the wearer moves about. The outside of the anklets is covered with designs in bold relief, one design is a series of wedges (*puchok rebong*), another is phyllomorphic and a crocodile figures on one example.\n\nDiam. 13\u00b76 cm. to 13\u00b71 cm.\n\nBrooke Low collection.\nCatalogue No. 393. (Plate V. fig. 10, b).\n\nSimilar anklets but made of silver are worn by unmarried Malay girls, and there is little doubt but that the Sea-Dyaks borrowed the ornament from them.\nA figure of a Sea-Dyak girl wearing a pair of these anklets in addition to coils of brass wire is given by Ling Roth (l.c., vol. I. p. 21).\n\nSea-Dyak women, especially the Sibuyaus and Balaus, commonly wear silver armlets known as *tumpa glos* shaped like the wooden armlets worn by men, but hollow and ornamented with repouss\u00e9 patterns; they are worn from the wrist to the elbow.\n\nLing Roth figures (l.c., vol. II. p. 74) a Kadyan penannular bracelet of copper with three silver wires running round it and also a metal bracelet from the Baram river with a simple clasp, both specimens are quoted as being in the collection of Mr. C. E. Peek.\n\n**Finger Rings.**\n\nI. Finger-rings of shell.\n\nII. Finger-rings of brass, copper etc.\n\n**I. Finger Rings of Shell.**\n\n1. Sea-Dyak.\n\n   a.

A girdle composed of five rows of large beads strung on strips of split rattan worn by women suspended from the lower border of the corset. The beads are of three kinds:\u2014(1) long white shell beads made by boring longitudinally the columella of a large gastropod shell (Type 3. Kyan name ino seh), (2) large spherical glass beads (Type 6) the dark-blue ones are known as tobi and are antique, the paler blue are known as kamiring and are more modern; (3) large spherical glazed clay beads, red in colour (Type 9. Kyan name dara bouin i.e. pig's blood). These alternate with one another, some shell discs being interspersed. At one end of the girdle is attached a short loop of beads of Type 11, some are blue with a red zigzag (known as klam batung umar i.e. bead worth part of a house and often worn hanging from the ear lobe by Kalamantan tribes of the Baram district). (Plate VII. fig. 6); some are of green glass with red and yellow circles painted on (known as klam buang kowit, i.e. bear's claws beads) (Plate VIII. fig. 8), and one is a fluted bead, of blue glass (known as klam dian, i.e. durian bead,) (Plate VIII. fig. 9) and a few common yellow beads are intermixed.\n\nLength 94 cm. Brooke Low collection.\n\nCatalogue No. 146. (Plate VI. fig. 12, a).\n\nIt seems likely that this girdle was looted from Kyans by Sea-Dyaks, as some of the beads are antique and antique beads in the possession of Sea-Dyaks have almost invariably been formerly the property of the more aboriginal natives of Borneo.\n\nA portion of this girdle has been figured by Ling Roth (l.c. Vol. II. p. 46).\n\n2. Milano\u2014bead girdle.\n\na. A girdle composed of five rows of beads strung on strips of split rattan, in the middle is a cross piece of rattan through which the rattan strips pass and at each end are similar cross-pieces; the loose ends of the rattan strips are joined\nwith elaborate knots. The beads are nearly all of Type 6, various shades of blue in colour (tobi and kamiring), there are four beads of the variety known to Kyans as klam dian; one bead is of opaque white glass. The value of the beads 304 in number has been assessed at $150.\n\nLength 62 cm. H.

Ling Roth l.c. Vol. II. p. 55).\n\nDusun women wear round the hips \"rows of red beads closely threaded to a depth or six inches or so\" (Whitehead, Exploration of Mt. Kina Balu, p. 106 and Plate).\n\nMurut women wear a somewhat similar bead girdle.\n\n3. Tanjong\u2014\"takup.\"\n\na.

(Plate VI. fig. 12, d).\n\nFigured by Ling Roth (l. c. Vol. II. p. 42). Ling Roth on the same page also figures a girdle and shell vine leaf from W. Borneo, the girdle appears to consist of seven strips of rattan on which are threaded numerous small brass rings.\n\nIII. Chain Girdles.\n\n1. Dusun\u2014chain girdle.\n\na. Consists of twenty-seven small chains of brass wire penannular links; the chains are held together by a string lacing.\nThe girdle is continuous without a fastening so must be slipped over the head and shoulders; it is worn by women over the hip-band of beads noted above.\n\nFrom the north of Mt. Kina Balu.\n\nMr. Steffen [P. vi. 92].\n\nCatalogue No. 784. (Plate VIII. fig. 16).\n\nSimilar chains are worn by Land-Dyak women of some districts in Upper Sarawak they are known as salit.\n\n2. Sea-Dyak\u2014\"tali mulong.\"\n\na. A chain band worn by women over the corset. The links are of brass and penannular and they are threaded on string in the same way as beads are threaded in bead-work (Plate VIII. fig. 15). The buckle consists of two strips of brass; the last row of links at each end of the girdle pass through perforations in the strips, the unattached edges of the strips are turned over in opposite directions so that they interlock.\n\nLength 77\u00b75 cm.; breadth 2\u00b78 cm. Brooke Low collection.\n\nCatalogue No. 147. (Plate VI. fig. 12, b).\n\nA portion of this girdle is figured by Ling Roth (l.c. Vol. II. p. 46).\n\nIV. BRASS GIRDLIES.\n\n1. Sea-Dyak\u2014\"senawir.\"\n\na. A flat strip of brass bent into a hoop with the ends turned over in opposite directions and interlocking. Forty-two small silver coins of Holland (dates 1718-1789) are suspended by brass links from the lower edge of the girdle and from the coins hang small notched and flat brass pendants. The outside of the brass hoop at one end is incised with simple geometrical designs and a phyllomorphic design. Worn by women over the corset.\n\nDiam. 29\u00b75 cm.; breadth 1\u00b78 cm.\n\nBrooke Low collection.\n\nCatalogue No. 145. (Plate VI. fig. 12, c).\nA small portion of this ornament is figured by Ling Roth (l.c. Vol. II. p. 46).\n\nBoth the senawir and the tali mulong have been largely displaced by belts made of dollars strung together with silver links, the buckle of the belt is generally of Chinese pattern and make. The Land-Dyak women of the Upper Sadong and Upper Sarawak (left-hand branch) rivers wear similar dollar girdles.\n\nV. CORSETS.\n\nThese are worn by Sea-Dyak and Land-Dyak women only; the Land-Dyak corset is of quite a different type to the Sea-Dyak article; there are two varieties of Sea-Dyak corsets:\u2014\n1. the rawai, 2. the rawai tinchin.\n\n1. Sea-Dyak\u2014\"rawai.\"\n\na. Twenty-five circles of strips of pandan leaf, graduated in size, the topmost * is 30\u00b74 cm. in diameter, the lowest is 21\u00b74 cm. On these circles are closely strung numerous small penannular annuli of brass; down the centre of the front of the corset runs a black line formed by 3 rings of rattan-cuticle stained black on each pandan leaf circle, on each side of the black line is a brass ring line flanked by a red strip formed by three rings of rattan cuticle stained red on each rattan circle (cf. ornamentation of \u00e9ngkrimu p. 46). The pandan leaf circles are bound together by five vertical rods of brass wire which transfix all the circles and pin them closely together. There is no means of opening out this corset which has therefore to be slipped over the head and shoulders of the wearer.\n\nHeight 21 cm.\nBrooke Low collection.\nCatalogue No. 144 a.

Below the rawai round the hips are frequently worn numerous separate pandan leaf circles strung with brass annuli but these may really be considered as components of the corset. It is now the fashion to decorate the rawai with rows of dollars attached by brass or silver links to the circles. The rawai should only be worn by married women, but the custom in now more honoured in the breach than in the observance.\n\n2. Sea-Dyak.\u2014\u201crawai tinchin.\u201d\n\na. Corset composed of ten rows of large broad penannular rings of brass strung on strips of split rattan; the rows are bound together one above the other on an internal framework of split rattan. The rows of rings do not form complete circles, but their ends are attached each to a vertical band of plaited brass wire; to each plaited band is fastened by brass wire links two vertical strips of brass, the free borders of which are turned back in opposite directions so that they can interlock; this primitive form of buckle is known as the pintu (lit, door). The brass penannular rings vary in breadth from 3\u00b75 cm. to 2\u00b77 cm., their diameter is about 1\u00b78 cm.; simple geometrical and scroll designs are incised on them. Narrow penannular brass rings (4 mm. broad) outwardly notched alternate with the broad rings of the bottom five rows of the corset. The front of the buckle is ornamented with incised geometrical designs and a phyllomorphic design (tankei marau, bunches of rattan). The corset is of equal diameter throughout.\n\nHeight 19\u00b75 cm.; diam. 24\u00b73 cm. Said to have been made by Malohs of the Kapuas River.\n\nBrooke Low collection.\n\nCatalogue No. 572. (Plate VI. fig. 13, b).\n\nThis form of corset was formerly confined to the Ulu Ai and Engkari Sea-Dyaks but its distribution seems to be wider nowadays. The front of a somewhat similar specimen in the Leiden Museum is figured by Ling Roth (l.c. Vol. II. p. 46).\n3. Land-Dyak\u2014\"sladan.\"\n\na. Corset worn by unmarried girls and widows: it is a cylinder of bark, slightly elliptical, covered on the outside with close-set vertical strips of triangular brass wire (ikan rashun), their ends bent over to clip the upper and lower edges of the bark cylinder. The brass strips that cover the part of the corset which is worn in front are narrower than those at the back.\n\nHeight 22 cm.; diam. 23\u00b74 \u00d7 cm. 21\u00b76 cm.\n\nFrom Krokong, Upper Sarawak. E. W. Byrde Esq. [P. 8. ii. 04].\n\nCatalogue No. 1401. (Plate VI. fig. 13, c).\n\nThese corsets are worn by the Land-Dyaks of the right-hand branch of the Upper Sarawak river,* not by those of the left-hand branch or of the Upper Sadong. As can well be imagined the corsets are most uncomfortable to wear and very difficult to put on and to remove; the removal of the corset is indeed a most painful process, the subject hangs by her hands from a beam whilst a friend gradually works the corset off inch by inch; a liberal application of oil is generally needed but even with this aid it may be some hours before the martyr to fashion is relieved of her brass bound casing.\n\nButtons and Buckles.\n\nI. Buttons.\n\n1. Malay (Brunei)\u2014\"ka'bumban.\"\n\na. Nineteen silver-gilt buttons: the buttons which are hollow are made in two halves, the lower half is provided with a loop, the upper half is decorated with a conventional pattern in repouss\u00e9.\n\n[Pd. 21. v. 04].\n\nCatalogue No. 1417. (Plate VIII. fig. 10).\n\n*Krokong, Singgi, Sahu, Serambu, Bombok, Peninjau etc., it is also worn by the Jagoi on the Dutch border.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 43, 1905.\nVery similar buttons are figured by Ling Roth (l.c. Vol. II. p. 42); they are worn by Milano, Kanowit and Tanjong women along the tightly-fitting sleeves of their jackets, also by Brunei Malay and Kadyan women down the front of their jackets. Strings of them are sometimes worn by Sea-Dyak women as necklets and one or two will often serve as the button of a bead necklet.\n\nII. Buckles.\n\nBuckles other than the primitive clasps of brass corsets and belts described above are not often met with amongst the Bornean tribes; the specimen described below was probably made in the Malay Peninsula where this kind of work is not uncommonly met with.\n\n1. Malay\u2014buckle.\n\na. A sharply pointed oval sheet of iron, convex from front to back, the border stepped. A conventional phyllomorphic design has been beaten in basso relievo into the front face of the ornament, over this a plate of silver has been laid and the two sheets of metal have been welded together, subsequently the front face of the buckle has been filed until all the silver has been removed except that filling in the sunk phyllomorphic design; the result is a design in silver on a background of iron. At the back of the ornament is a large iron loop.\n\n14 cm. \u00d7 7\u00b71 cm.\n\nSaid to come from Sirhassen, Natuna Islands. [Pd].\n\nCatalogue No. 1037.\n\nThe belts made of dollars strung together by silver wire links much worn by Sea-Dyak and Land-Dyak women are generally fastened with a silver S-shaped hook of Chinese manufacture and design.\nExplanation of Plates I.\u2014VIII.\n\nPlate I.\n\nFig. 1. \u00d7 \u00bd linear.\n   a.

Right Reverend Bishop Hose (President) Hon. W. R. Collyer I.S.O., Dr. Hanitsch, Mr. G. Maxwell, Mr. Bartlett, Mr. P. J. Burgess, Mr. C. B. Kloss, Mr. Brockman, Mr. W. G. St. Clair, Mr. C. J. Saunders, Mr. Makepeace, Mr. Watkins, Mr. V. Flower, Mr. H. N. Ridley.\n\nThe minutes of the last General Meeting were read and confirmed.\n\nThe reports of the Council and Treasurer were laid on the table and their adoption moved by Mr. C. J. Saunders seconded by Mr. G. Maxwell and they were unanimously adopted.\n\nThe members elected by the Council for the previous year were formally confirmed in their election by the meeting.\n\nThe Officers and Council for the new year were then elected viz.:\n\nPresident: Right Reverend Bishop Hose.\nVice President for Singapore: Hon. W. R. Collyer.\nVice President for Penang: Hon. J. K. Birch.\nHon. Secretary: H. N. Ridley.\nHon. Treasurer: Dr. Hanitsch.\nCouncillors: Mr. W. G. St. Clair, Mr. G. Maxwell, Mr. C. B. Kloss, Mr. V. Flower, Mr. A. Knight.\n\nThe President proposed that H. E. the Governor should be asked to become Patron of the Society which was unanimously agreed to.\n\nMr. St. Clair proposed a vote of thanks to the Bishop, as President for the previous year which was carried unanimously.\n\nThe President proposed a vote of thanks to the Hon. Secretary and Treasurer which was carried unanimously.\n\nThe Meeting then adjourned.\nAnnual Report for 1904.\n\nThe Council are pleased to report again that the affairs of the Society are in the matter of its finances in an extremely satisfactory condition.\n\nTwo numbers of the Journal were published during the year, and two more are in the printers' hands. Of the two published, one by Mr. Shelford contains a well illustrated account of the musical instruments of Borneo in the Sarawak Museum. Another catalogue of the personal ornaments of the Dyaks by the same author has been received, with a series of photogravures and other illustrations. The supply of interesting papers by various members of the society dealing with Ethnological, Natural History and Geographical subjects relating to the Malay Peninsula and its neighbourhood is greater now than in former years, and there is little difficulty in producing Journals worthy of the Society.\n\nThe Map of the Malay Peninsula is now nearly out of print, and it will be necessary shortly to produce a new edition. Some materials for this have already been collected, and the Council will be glad to receive any further materials additions or corrections.\n\nThe Council have to express the greatest regret for the death of two members who have always taken a prominent part in the affairs of the society and were for a considerable time members of the council, Mr. C. W. Kynnersley and Mr. H. Eschke. The first-named gentleman was Vice-President for Singapore till he left for England in April, and had written several papers for the Journal, one of which dealing with his travels in Southern Siam has just been printed. Mr. Eschke was also a member of the council for some years,\nand was so at the time of his death. The Society has also lost by death Datoh James Meldrum, Datoh Bintara Dalam, and Mr. J. B. M.

RIDLEY.\n\nThere is perhaps no order of plants in the Malay Peninsula which contains so large a percentage of ornamental flowering species, as that of the Gesnerace\u00e6 or Cyrtandreae. Few indeed are those which either in foliage or more often in flower do not strike the eye of a botanist in our hill woods. Unfortunately a considerable number are by no means easy of cultivation and among these the most difficult are the small half-shrubby kinds, Didymocarpi and Didissandras which possess the most beautiful flowers of every colour from white to red, blue and yellow. A bank covered with a mass of *Didymocarpus quinquevulnera* as it may be seen along the Tras route or in the Pahang woods is worth going a long way to see.\n\nThe number of species recorded in this paper as occurring in the Malay Peninsula is 121 and it is probable that at least as many more remain uncollected, as several of the genera are remarkably local, so that each mountain ridge may be expected to produce one or more species. In the Flora of British India the number of species recorded from the Malay Peninsula was 22, but at the time that that part of the work was published (1884) almost all that were known were from Penang, Singapore and Malacca. Since then I have myself collected a large number, in Perak, Pahang, Selangor and elsewhere. Mr. Curtis obtained a very large series of new species from the limestone Islands of Lankawi, a very rich district, and I have also seen the collections of Scortechini, Kunstler and Wray from the Perak Hills, loaned to me by Dr. Prain of the Calcutta Gardens. In 1895 I published in the Linnean Society's Journal a paper on Cyrtandrace\u00e6 Malayenses (vol. XXXII p. 497) containing a list of 72 species, all that were known at the time.\n\nJour Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 43, 1905.\nGenera.\n\n\u00c6schynanthus, an epiphytic genus with plumed seeds easily drifted by the wind, is the most widely diffused genus in the surrounding islands. One Borneo-Siamese species occurs as far south as Lankawi, several occur in Sumatra and Borneo as well as the Peninsula, and the number of endemic species is small compared with other genera.\n\nAgalmyla is a small genus of climbers, of which one species is abundant in the Perak hills, and Sumatra and Java. It has also plumed seeds.\n\nDidissandra as laid down by Mr. Clarke comprised all Didymocarpi as defined by him which had four complete stamens instead of two. I have preferred to separate from Didymocarpus the plants with short-tubed flower, and very short stamens with a distinctly longer style. This principle excludes also from Didissandra several of Mr. Clarke's sections. Such plants as D. ornata of Borneo are more nearly allied to Boea and Paraboea than to Didymocarpus. Didissandra thus as far as regards the Malay Peninsula includes two sections, which might almost be made distinct genera: the section Cyrtandrodes (Clarke) tall shrubby plants with distant leaves and flowers in the lower axils, two species; and the very distinct section Speciosae, with 71 species of small shrublets with crowded leaves and large and showy blue, white or yellow flowers, a very distinct group, of which I have not seen any species even from Sumatra or Borneo. In some respects they approach the section Heteroboea of Didymocarpus, and one very charming white flowered plant Didymocarpus venustus possesses all the characteristics of this group of Didissandra except that it has but two stamens.\n\nDidymocarpus even excluding the genera Loxocarpus and Paraboea contains a considerable variety of forms but it is very difficult at present to split the genus further. It includes all the long tubed plants with two filiform stamens and a simple stigma. Among the aberrant forms we find D.\ncorchorifolia a stout much branched woody shrub, with flowers of the form of a snapdragon (Antirrhinum) the upper and lower lips of the corolla being pressed together, and some species such as D. pumila quite dwarf and stemless with short flowers, but with the pistil and stamens of other species. D. lilacina from Pahang is also quite abnormal having very small flowers borne on a short peduncle adnate to the leaf petiole. This would perhaps be better made into a distinct genus; many of the other species however fall into natural groups, such as the section Heteroboea, shrublets with crowded rough leaves, and large trumpet-shaped flowers slender axillary peduncle. The plants of this section are almost confined to the Peninsula disappearing north of Penang, and less abundant in Borneo and Sumatra.\n\nDidymocarpi seem more scanty in Borneo than in the Malay Peninsula, and the sections most abundant there are those that are rare here. A group of almost stemless little plants, lanceolate or oblanceolate sometimes peltate leaves and small violet or white flowers (\u00a7 Kompsoboa of Clarke excluding D. Kompsoboa a plant closely allied to D. platypus) is represented by D. heterophylla, D. perdita etc., in the Peninsula where they are characteristic of the low country or bases of the hills, and several species occur in the Natunas and Lingga Island. The lowland Salicinae with narrow crowded leaves sometimes deeply cut occur in Borneo as far as Labuk Bay and in Lingga. These two groups are absent from the hill forests of the interior above 1,000 feet elevation.\n\nThe species of this genus are as local in their distribution as those of Didissandra; of forty-four species only four have been met with outside the Peninsula and most of the endemic species are only at present known from single localities of small area.\n\nChirita is a genus also of somewhat heterogeneous nature, distinguished by its bifid style. The flowers are in many species of an azure blue, an unusual color in the order, and frequently have the mouth of the corolla\ntube bearded with yellow hairs. The headquarters of the genus is India and Southern China, but a number of species occur in Java and Sumatra, mostly in the limestone districts. Six species occur in the Peninsula, five of which are endemic and one gets to Siam.\n\n*Loxocarpus*, a small genus referred to *Didymocarpus* as a section by Mr. Clarke, seems sufficiently distinct in its short tubed and short stamened flowers and horn-like capsule. All the species are closely allied. There are about 7, of which three endemic ones occur in the Malay Peninsula, the remainder in Borneo.\n\nThe next three genera comprise the plants with short tubed flowers, 2 very short stamens with longer style, and narrow cylindric fruit. *Paraboea* is merely distinguished from *Boea* by its capsule not twisting when splitting. The genus was amalgamated with *Didymocarpus* by Clarke, but should certainly be kept separate. In *P. cordata* and two allied species, the corolla is campanulate. The other species have hardly any tube to the corolla at all. This latter section is confined to limestone rocks, while *P. cordata* and its allies are found on granite or sandstone. The flowers are all small and white or at most tinted with pink. There are about 20 species known, some from Borneo and Siam. All the 12 Malay Peninsula species are endemic.\n\n*Boea* resembles *Paraboea* except that the capsule is spirally twisted in dehiscing. It includes about 22 species, ranging India, Khasiya hills, through Burma, China, Formosa and Cochin China, the Malay islands to New Guinea, and the Philippines to Australia and New Ireland. All the species known to me inhabit limestone rocks, except *B. elegans*, which grows on the granite precipices of Kedah Peak. They are usually half-shrubby plants with silvery white leaves covered with felted silky hairs. There are two sections, one has usually tall leafy stems rising from a large rosette of leaves, with a woody stem below which grows in clefts of rocks. The flowers\nare often very large quite flat, azure blue or rose color, and very beautiful. The other section has a slender peduncle rising from the tuft of leaves, as in *Paraboea*, and the leaves are often covered with red or ochre wool beneath, the flowers are smaller often quite small, white rose or lilac. All the species recorded from the Peninsula, 9 in number, are endemic.\n\n*Phyllboeoa* differs only from *Boea* in the calyx being trifid instead of five lobed. Two species are known, one from Burma and the endemic species of the Lankawi islands. The latter has rather weak leafy stems, with silvery leaves like those of Boea, and purple blue flowers.\n\n*Boeica* is a small genus of five species differing from *Paraboea* only in having four complete stamens. Four of the species which are half shrubby plants with much branched cymes on a long slender peduncle, are found in India and Burma. The only one from our region is a very small plant with a short peduncle bearing 2 or 3 pink flowers which occurs in the Lankawi islands.\n\nIn the remaining genera of the order the fruit is not a long slender beaked capsule but oblong, or almost globose, or a pyxis.\n\n*Orchadocarpa* is a monotypic genus, containing a single species, a dwarf plant with a lax cyme of lilac flowers, the sepals free to the base, longer than the small oblong hairy capsule. It seems most nearly allied to *Loxonia* a native of Java and Sumatra.\n\n*Rhyncoglossum* is a weak erect almost glabrous herb with a raceme of blue flowers. Two species are known, one from the Philippines, the other occurring in India and Burma and through all the Malay islands to the Philippines. It seems to be very common throughout this region but is rare in the Peninsula.\n\n*Epithema* is a small genus of soft limestone rock herbs with a tuft of very small blue or white flowers in a head, and a\npyxis-like capsule, opening by a cap. The species are very closely allied and perhaps might all be classed as one somewhat variable one, except a single African species. The others extend over all the islands and into India, and our single species occurs wherever there are limestone rocks.\n\nMonophyllaea is also a limestone rock genus remarkable for possessing a single often very large leaf, and a scorpioid cyme or panicle of very small white flowers. There are 9 species known ranging from Southern Siam to Sumatra, Borneo and Java. Two species occur in the Peninsula, one also in Java and Sumatra, and the other endemic.\n\nStauranthera is a small genus of 3 species of soft herbs with blue or violet flowers. Two species occur in the Peninsula and also in Burma and Assam, the third species in the genus is Javanese.\n\nRhynchotechum is a genus of 9 species of which 6 are Indian and Burmese, two occur in Java one of which is not rare in the hills of the Peninsula. It is a small shrub with panicles of small cream white flowers.\n\nCyrtandrom\u00e6a are shrubby plants of rather coarse habit occurring on banks in woods. They have white flowers protruding from a red calyx, rather showy. Nine species are recorded from Tenasserim and the Nicobar islands to Sumatra and Java. Three species occur in the Peninsula one of which is found also in Sumatra.\n\nCyrtandra is a large genus of 170 species occurring from the Sandwich islands through the Malay islands into the Peninsula as far north as Penang. Abundant in the Polynesian and Malay islands, they are scanty in the Peninsula where we have only 7 kinds of which four are endemic. The other three occur in Sumatra also. They are shrubby plants with heads of yellow white or red flowers from the axils of the lower leaves. The fruits are sausage shaped corky berries, with minute seeds.\nThey inhabit dense forests often forming large patches on the ground. A few are however epiphytic.\n\nSummary of Distribution.\n\nThere are at present known 121 species of the order in the Peninsula, belonging to 18 genera. Of these 95 are endemic, 7 occur also in Burma and Siam, 17 occur also in Sumatra and 9 in Borneo, 5 only in Java, only a single species occurs in India beyond Burma, and only 4 in the islands further east than Java.\n\nHabitats. The greater number of species are hill plants growing on rocks or banks at an altitude of from 1 to 6000 feet elevation. The species occurring in the low-lying country are few, one or two species of *Didymocarpus* chiefly of the *Heteroboea* section and some *Cyrtandra* and *Stauranthera*. Besides which are several of the epiphytic *Aeschynanthi*. All these lowland plants disappear as one ascends the hills and are replaced by a different series. The limestone rocks are very prolific in species and several genera are quite peculiar to them. Such are *Boea*, *Monophylla*, *Epithema*, *Phylloboea*.\n| Genus               | Distribution                                      | No of Species |\n|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Aeschynanthus      | Indo-Malaya, Siam, Hongkong                      | 70           |\n| Agalmyla           | Malaya                                           | 3            |\n| Didissandra        | \"                                               | 20           |\n| Didymocarpus       | Indo-Malaya                                      | 100          |\n| Chirita            | Indo-Malaya, China                               | 50           |\n| Loxocarpus         | Malay Peninsula and Borneo                       | 7            |\n| Paraboea           | Siam, Malay Peninsula, Borneo                    | 20           |\n| B\u0153a                | India, Siam, Malaya, China                       | 22           |\n| Phylloboea         | Siam                                             | 2            |\n| B\u0153ica              | Burma, Malay Peninsula                            | 5            |\n| Orchadocarpa       | Endemic                                          | 1            |\n| Rhynchoglossum     | Tenasserim to Malay Islands                      | 2            |\n| Epithema           | Trop.

In both species the mesonotum is quite flat; in C. lutea the scutellum is not raised above the level of\nthe mesonotum; in *C. ruficeps* it is slightly raised; the parapsidal furrows are absent. *C. lutea* may belong to *Platybracon*, Sz\u00e9p.\n\n*Lissobracon*, gen. nov.\n\nHead cubital; temples broad; occiput and cheeks not margined.

Antenn\u00e6 stout, not narrowed towards the apex.\n\nThis genus has not a semicircular opening between the mouth and the mandibles, it being transverse, not rounded. In other respects it agrees fairly well with the *Braconne\u00e6* except that the transverse median nervure is not interstitial; but it does not fit very well into any of the tribes.

Cerci long, slender. Legs short and stout; the metatarsus not much longer than the 2nd joint; cerci minute. Temples broad. Ovipositor projecting.\n\nThe abdomen is broad, not much longer than the head and thorax; basal segment broad; the other segments are broader than long; hypopygium short, vertex not much depressed.\n\nThis genus is allied to *Spinaria*. It may be identical with *Acanthobracon*, Sz\u00e9p; but the description of that author is too short to enable me to decide this. So far as the description goes Szepligeti\u2019s genus differs from mine in the 3rd abscissa of the radius not reaching to the apex of the wing and no mention is made of the pobrachial nervure in hind wings being roundly curved, directed downwards from the pr\u00e6brachial towards the apex of the wing, not obliquely sloped, straight from bottom to top as usual. This nervure, in fact, has the appearance of being a 2nd cubital nervure and may not be the equivalent of the\ntransverse pobrachial nervure. There is indeed, below the ordinary cubitus a longitudinal nervure which may be the pobrachial and the transverse nervure (which springs from shortly beyond its middle) may be the ordinary pobrachial transverse nervure. To put the matter in another way, above the anal cellule there are 2 large median cellules, the basal closed, the apical open\u2014followed by the ordinary posterior cellule, also open below. I am not acquainted with any genus of Braconidae having this peculiar neuration in the hind wings. If my genus be really identical with Acanthobracon it seems remarkable that its describer has not noticed the odd neuration.\n\n*Trichiobracon pilosus*, sp. nov.\n\nLuteous, the antenn\u00e6 black; the wings to the transverse basal nervure yellowish-hyaline, beyond that smoky-fuscous, the stigma and apical nervures black.

N. Ridley.\n\nThe island of Borneo is very rich in aroids, and the present list represents doubtless but a small portion of those which will eventually be found by collectors. I have attempted however to make it as complete as I could, and to record all species previously described together with a number collected by myself in a short trip to B. Sarawak, in 1903 and others obtained by Dr. Haviland some years previously. Dr. Engler in Malesia described a number collected by Dr. Beccari chiefly in Sarawak, but though I was working over Dr. Beccari's old collecting ground, I obtained a considerable number which appear to have escaped him.\n\nThe chief difficulty in the study of aroids lies in the very bad habit of some botanists and gardeners of describing species from leaves only. Aroids vary very much in the form and venation of their leaves, and leaf descriptions are quite worthless, and have led to great confusion. This is especially the case in Borneo aroids for many species possess very ornamental leaves and have been introduced as cultivated plants, and inadequately described and named.\n\nCRYPTOCORYNE.\n\nThis genus of aquatic aroids seems to obtain its maximum development in Borneo though several species occur in India and the Malay peninsula and in islands of the archipelago.

On a peduncle 2 inches long. Spathe at first narrow acuminate 4-5 inches long white, tubular portion 1 inch long pale green limb recurved, when open broadly lanceolate acuminate. Male spadix cylindric 3 inches long, flowers very numerous, all fertile, no appendage of barren flowers. Flowers oblong, anther cells distant. Female portion 1 inch long no nude portion between, pistils ovoid narrowed slightly upwards towards the discoid stigma.\n\nSarawak, Matang, in rocks in a stream abundant, (Ridley 11582) Endemic.

Sarawak at Bidi (Ridley). This plant originally described from cultivated plants, was sent to the Botanic Gardens Singapore by Mr. Chatterjee of Calcutta as Sch. crispata from which however it is very distinct.\n\n**Sch. caulescens**, n. sp.\n\nStem 2-4 inches long, base rooting, upper part ascending, with alternate leaves a quarter of an inch apart. Leaves elliptic lanceolate to ovate subacute at the tip, base rounded 2-4 inches long 1-1\\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch wide, minutely pustular on both surfaces, nerves primary 10 pairs, midrib scurfy, the basal nerves run parallel to the edge forming a distinct margin at the tip, petiole 1\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long or much shorter in the upper leaves sheathing for from nearly one half of its length in the lower leaves, to \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of its length in the upper shorter petioles, tips of sheath free. Spathe from the upper axil, on a peduncle about \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long slender, base of spathe \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) inch long narrowed to the base. Spadix slender 1 inch long male portion slender cylindric flowers apparently fertile to the tip.\n\nSarawak, Bidi. (Ridley).\n\nApparently allied to Sch. conoidea Engl. but the long petioles distinguish it from this. The elongate stem is unusual but does occur in the genus.\n\nAs often happens in Schismatoglottis I was unable to find fully developed spadices in several species. One plant collected at Bau in Sarawak seemed closely allied to S. brevipes Hook. fil and S. wallichii of the Malay peninsula but had remarkably long petioles over 6 inches long with an ovate often cordate leaf 3 inches long beneath, and blotched with dark green above. Another of the same section had leaves as large as those of Sch.\nWallichii but very short petioles sheathing for half the length or more. The spathe complete but too much crushed in drying resembles that of Sch. calyprata Zoll. I met with it on Matang. A plant closely allied to the last named species was met with at Bau and may possibly be a form of S. calyprata. The leaves are broadly ovate elliptic, and cordate at the base, the lobes rounded and very close together.\n\n**Piptospatha**, N. E. Br.\n\n*P. insignis*, Br.

Three other species of the genus are described, two from the Sandwich islands and one from New Caledonia so that the discovery of a fourth from the Malay Peninsula is of no little interest. The plant itself might easily be taken for a grass with its reed-like hollow stems and plicate leaves, like those of Panicum plicatum but much stiffer and the panicle of small flowers is not at all unlike that of a grass till their structure is examined. Curiously the Malayan species is more nearly allied to one of the\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 44, 1905.\nHawaiian species than to the New Caledonia one. I cannot recall any parallel case of such a distribution of any genus in our flora, unless one compares it with the large genus Cyrtandra in Gesneraceae which attains its maximum of development in the Sandwich islands and spreads through the Malay islands as far as to the peninsula where it dies out towards the North.\n\nI am indebted to Mr. A.

The stem is about 12 feet long densely covered with the sheaths which are densely bristly brown. The rattan has joints 3 inches long 1 inch through; the flagella about 10 feet long covered with half circles of black tipped hooks except on the very slender narrow sheaths about 3 or 4 on each flagellum.

It is unique in Pinangas in its exceedingly short\nstem covered by the old leaf sheaths from which arises a short thick double spathe which just protrudes above the sheaths. When it opens, the short stout spadix is densely covered with ivory white male flowers, which fall off next day, and the bright crimson rachis bearing small pink female flowers is seen. The rachis then elongates remaining pink and bearing its small cylindric fruit. A number of live plants have been sent by the discoverer to the Botanic Gardens Singapore, where it seems likely to do well.\n\n*Licuala lanuginosa*, n. sp.\n\nLeaf with a stout bluntly 3 angled petiole over a foot long \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch through, thorny for about half its length, thorns conic short brown, blade 6 lobed, lobes linear stiff with short broad teeth 13 inches long one inch wide, with 3 or more ribs on each.

Leaf stalk 12 to 15 feet long \\( 1\\frac{1}{2} \\) inch thick unarmed deeply channelled green, blade suborbicular 4 feet across about 6 feet long split nearly to the base into sharp edged linear acuminate lobes. Male inflorescence of three cylindrical catkins 14 inches long \\( 1\\frac{1}{4} \\) inch thick. Bracts oblong with an ovate obtuse limb.

Corolla\nwith three linear narrow lobes edges rounded fringed, \\( \\frac{3}{8} \\) inch long. Stamens filaments short, anthers long linear narrow acute. Female spadix 12 in. long with a broad flattened orange peduncle 3 inches long. Flowers about 20, crowded, terminal portion of spadix barren, about 2 inches long. Bracts 2 broadly semicircular 1 inch long and as wide, (in young fruit) edges lacerate, orange brown outside, yellowish white within stigmas. Young fruit ob-ovoid dark green with 3-4 white lines corresponding to cells sepals obovate orange 2 inches long paler at base. Petals longer rounded truncate. Seeds 3 oblong woody, outer face convex inner face obscurely 3 angled, 3 inches long 1 inch through covered with rough brown hair.\n\nPerak in dense forest at Kamuning near Sungei Siput, (Machado). Native name \"Chang-hai.\"\n\nThe genus Borassus has hitherto been considered to consist of a single species Borassus flabelliformis L. This species including B. athiopum Mart. is a native of Africa and probably India. A sacred tree of the Hindus it has been carried all over the east, and more or less established itself chiefly in sandy places near the sea, or in temple grounds. It does not thrive in damp spots nor does forest country suit it at all. It is evidently a desert plant by nature. This plant is known as Lontar by the Malays. Lon being an old name for Pohon \"tree,\" and Tah being the Hindu Tal, the name of the Borassus. I was therefore much surprised when Mr. Machado sent me a leaf and seeds of a Borassus he had found in the forests of Kamuning in some quantity. He has since sent me complete material of this remarkable palm, which proves to be quite distinct from the well-known Lontar or Palmyra palm. It differs from that species in the entirely thornless petiole, and the blade of the leaf split to the base in the three lobed calyx, and narrow petals of the male flower, and in the long narrow anthers. I can find no description of Borassus to agree with this. All the Indian descriptions are undoubtedly those of B. flabelliformis, Rumphius.\nHerb. Amboin. I p. 4-5. t. 10 describes and figures \"Lontarus domesticus\" which is certainly the same plant, and Loureiro's *B. flabelliformis* is the same. The latter author describes also a *B. tunicata* from the Decan and Guzerat, which has unarmed petioles and is referred by Wendland to *Pholidecarpus*. But the description does not fit the new Borassus and no *Pholidocarpus* is known from that region and what Loureiro intended is quite obscure.\n\n**CYPERACE\u00c6.**\n\n*Mapania longispica*, n. sp.\n\nA large tufted plant.

Hanitsch, Ph. D.\n\nWith one Plate.\n\nIn a former number of this Journal* I described a collection of coins which in the year 1900 had been obtained during excavations near the mouth of the Malacca river, and which had been collected together by the Hon'ble W. Egerton, Resident Councillor of Malacca, and presented by him to the Raffles Museum. The most interesting of these, previously not described, were certain Portuguese tin coins from the time of King Emmanuel (1495-1521) and John III (1521-1557), the earliest of which must have been struck by Albuquerque soon after his occupation of Malacca (1511). Towards the end of last year (1904) the Hon'ble R. N. Bland, Resident Councillor of Malacca, succeeded in obtaining more coins from the same locality which he generously presented to the Raffles Museum. He tells me that the dredger brought them up imbedded in a kind of blue clay, possibly a little to the sea-ward of the place where Mr. Egerton's were found.\n\nThe most remarkable of these are six huge tin coins, struck in two varieties, giving neither the date nor the name of a ruler, but having a pattern similar to that of the coins issued by King Emmanuel and John III., namely with the cross on the obverse and the sphere on the reverse. The one variety (see figs. 1 and 1a), of which there are five specimens, measures from 35 to 36 mm. in diameter, 6 mm. in thickness and weighs from 37 to 41\u00b75 grammes. On the obverse, around the cross, is the inscription NOSTRE SPES VNICA CRVX XPI. The mistake in NOSTRE is very extraordinary, but such errors are not uncom-\n\n* \"On a Collection of Coins from Malacca.\" Journal, Straits Branch, R. Asiatic Society, No. 39, June 1903, pp. 183 to 201, 2 plates.\n\nJour. S. B. R. A. Soc., No. 44, 1905.\nmon on old Portuguese coins. The last three letters XPI, if taken as Latin characters, would be difficult of interpretation. Taken as Greek they would stand for Christ, although they are then more usually written in the form of a monogram \u03a7. For this interpretation I am indebted to Mr. Robert Sewell, M. R. A. S., who in January last passed through Singapore and kindly examined the coin.\n\nThe inscription on the reverse is more difficult to read, the last few letters especially being much worn on all five coins. The letters seem to be SMPRDEPV SORDIEM. The first four characters I take for an abbreviation for 'semper.' The next seven letters may stand for 'Depulsor,' the letter 'l' being omitted or being covered by part of the device, viz. the projecting axis of the globe. The word 'Depulsor' occurs in a few Latin inscriptions, as an epithet of Jupiter, the averter of evil. The last four or five letters are very indistinct. 'Diem' would hardly give any sense, and I am inclined to think that the inscription should read something like 'Semper Depulsor Deus'.\n\nThe other variety (see figs. 2 and 2a) of which there is only one specimen, is of an unusual shape, the diameter of the obverse being 37 mm., but that of the reverse 35 mm. only, giving to the coin the shape of a truncated cone, and this appearance is heightened by the sharp edges of the coin. Its thickness is 6\u00b75 mm. and its weight 45 grammes. The coin further differs from the first variety by the shape of the cross, the outlines of its arms being not parallel to each other, but converging towards the centre, and by the sphere on the reverse being somewhat smaller. The inscription, however, is the same on the two varieties.\n\nVery similar to these is a much smaller coin (see figs. 3, 3a, 4 and 4a), also of tin, 24 mm. in diameter, 1\u00b75 mm. in thickness and 4\u00b71 grammes in weight. It again shows the usual devices of the cross and the sphere. The reverse bears no inscription, whilst the obverse has the words NOSTRAE SPES VNICA, resembling thus the above described large coins by another, almost incredible, mistake. The word 'crux' is omitted, but may be understood from the figure of the cross in the middle of the inscription. There were three specimens of this coin.\nThe other Portuguese coins collected by Mr. Bland are identical with those described in my former paper. I therefore merely give the number of the specimens found with their references:\n\nEight coins from the reign of King Emmanuel (1495-1521), loc. cit. p. 194 pl. I, figs. 2 and 2a.\n\nEight coins from the reign of King John III (1521-1557), loc. cit. pl. II, figs. 8 and 8a.\n\nFive coins from the same reign, loc. cit. pl. II, figs. 9 and 9a.\n\nSeven coins from the same reign, loc. cit. pl. II, figs. 10 and 10a.\n\nThree coins without inscription, loc. cit. pl. I, figs. 3 and 3a.\n\nOne coin, with the letters B. A. and three crossed arrows between them, loc. cit. pl. II, figs 12 and 12a.\n\nIn addition to these there are about twenty-five Malay coins, most of them, however, too much worn to be deciphered.\n\nOne of them bears the inscription \u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0644 and is almost identical with the one described in my former paper (p. 185, pl. I, fig. 5). The Rev. Dr. Luering has kindly pointed out to me that the reading I gave at the time of this inscription, viz. \"maliku 'l-'\u00e2dil\" and the translation 'The just king,' were based on a wrong vocalisation of the first word which is not to be read 'malik,' i.e. 'king,' but 'milk' or 'mulk,' that is 'possession,' 'property,' and is often used with regard to coinage in the sense of the French 'fonds.' He further says that the word '\u00e2dil' which originally means 'just,' 'righteous,' has in this connection the secondary meaning of 'equal weight,' 'full weight,' so that the inscription might be translated 'full weight currency,' or 'legal tender.'\n\nI wish to point out that the figures of the accompanying plate are faithful reproductions of the originals, in natural size, and that their indistinctness is not due to the photographer and printer, but to the condition in which the coins were found. Only by examining the coins in different lights was it possible to decipher their inscriptions.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 44, 1905.\nExplanation of the Plate:\n\nFig. 1. Obverse See page 213\nFig. 1 A.

E.\n\nNotes on Material and Method of Erecting in the Straits Settlements.\n\n1. The number of many-branched terminals and massive rods and cables of pure copper which adorn most of the buildings, indicate that the importance of attempting to safeguard against the effect of lightning discharges is generally appreciated. A study of the attempts too frequently reveals a considerable lack of knowledge of modern methods.\n\n2. Numerous cases which have come under the writer's observation are applications of a theory, which obtained general credence twenty or thirty years ago, that a conductor \"protected\" a defined area bearing some direct relation to its height. A \"law\" to this effect was actually laid down and found many adherents\u2014possibly because of its simplicity.\n\n3. In other cases a quite disproportionate amount of attention is paid to the earth connection, sometimes at the expense of the material and work above ground. Tests which show a resistance of more than an ohm or two, though made, frequently, during dry weather, are often considered sufficient to condemn a conductor satisfactory in other respects.\n\n4. The writer has been called upon to inspect a large number of conductors upon Government and Municipal buildings during the past few years, and is forced to the conclusion that, in a large majority of instances, much greater protection could be provided for a smaller initial outlay.\n\n5. To illustrate this the case of a certain powder magazine in the Colony may be cited. As is usual for buildings of this sort, very considerable care had been exercised by the Authorities in the provision of elaborate conductors\u2014and a very considerable sum expended upon material and work. Broad strip of pure copper is the material used and this is run along the main\n\nJour. S. B. R. A. Soc., No. 44, 1905.\nridge of roof and connected to eight points from which similar strip is taken down to eight earth connections. As the brief suggestions which follow may serve to indicate, seven of these \"earths\" are quite unnecessary and, further, had an equivalent weight of copper been used in the form of a light stranded wire, very much better protection would be afforded.\n\n6. The determination of the size and section of the conductor, whether of copper or iron, depends more upon mechanical strength and durability than conductive properties. There is little danger of the wires becoming melted and, if the system is inter-connected, the fusion of certain lengths would not affect the utility of the conductor as a whole to any serious extent. The network advocated by the writer would deal with succeeding discharges whereas a break in a single conductor has frequently been the cause of damage. Fusion of part of the network would not escape notice and, in a sense, would be satisfactory in affording proof that the conductor had seen active service.\n\n7. The material used by the writer is galvanised iron in the form of a light cable composed of seven strands of number sixteen gauge wire. (7/18) This affords ample mechanical strength, is pliable and unobtrusive in appearance. Zinc saddles are used to secure it to ridges of roof and down walls to earth. It is frequently possible to make use of the down pipes from roof gutters by running the conductor through them.\n\n8. In order to make the system as far as possible jointless as regards the work on the roof, which usually escapes supervision, the writer has recently designed a tubular point through which the conductor itself is drawn, doubled, and allowed to project an inch or so from the top. A set-screw at the base provides sufficient contact without the necessity of soldering\u2014often so awkward an operation on a roof that it is left undone altogether. The point is practically formed of the conductor itself and joints become unnecessary above ground.\n\n9. The number of points and the amount of wire used for any building must depend upon the degree of safety desired and the funds available for providing it. The fact that many points and much wire mean better protection should be thoroughly recognised. In practice something must be sacrificed to\nGalvanised Iron Wire.\n\nGalvanised Iron Tube.\n\nWrought Iron.\n\nCement.\n\nSECTION.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 44, 1905.\nappearance in the case of ordinary buildings and the multiplication of points, even of the short pattern now advocated, cannot be carried to excess. Prominent ridges should be provided with one for every fifteen or twenty feet of length; every corner should also have its point and all should be connected together and to the \"earth.\"\n\n10. This connecting up of points results in a net-work over the whole roof which forms the nearest feasible approach to the continuous metallic screen held by modern views to constitute an absolute safeguard.\n\n11. As suggested in paragraph 7 the down pipes from rain guttering may frequently be used for bringing down the wires from roof net-work to earth. The connection to roof net-work should be made by inserting the wire into a corner point, where it will meet two net-work wires. Soldered joints will still be unnecessary as the wires will be in close contact throughout the length of the point.\n\n12. The question of earth connection has next to be considered. This is usually held to be of primary importance and various rules are laid down which state the exact maximum resistance permissible. It is, no doubt, desirable that the resistance should be reasonably low so that disturbance may be avoided, but whether it be of two ohms or fifty matters very little. The effect of a poor earth connection was recently demonstrated at the Civil Prisons in Singapore, where a discharge taken by the conductor blew out the soil over the earth connection, leaving a hole about three feet in diameter and two deep. This earth was formed of the coiled end of the conductor\u2014a heavy galvanised iron cable\u2014and was buried to a depth of a couple of feet only, on a slope. Moist soil would have been reached by taking it a little further away to lower ground and burying it a little deeper, but, on enquiry, the writer found that the workman responsible had miscalculated the length required, cut the cable and hurriedly buried the end. The instance serves to show that no great harm results from imperfect earth connections if they are placed sufficiently far from foundations.\n\n13. It is rarely a matter of great difficulty or expense\u2014especially where galvanised iron is the material used\u2014to continue the conductor to permanently damp earth. If it is laid\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nin a trench twelve or fifteen inches deep, and taken to a point not less than one hundred feet from the building where damp soil may be reached without an excessive amount of excavation, the earth connection may be said to be perfect. By taking the conductor this distance from the building not only is the risk of damage due to disturbance near foundations averted, but an increased area of earth connection is obtained.\n\n14. Except in the case of very small buildings it is advisable to have at least two connections between the roof net-work and the earth. In extensive buildings the writer has made a practice of bringing down six or more. In these cases it is occasionally necessary, from motives of economy, to join the down wires together and continue one only away to the \"earth.\" There is no difficulty in making thoroughly good, soldered joints in galvanised cable on terra firma, but, if funds allow, it is a much better plan to have a continuous trench round the building into which all the down wires are taken and then continued, laid up together, away to the deep \"earth.\"\n\n15. As regards the comparative cost, it is interesting to note that, for the same outlay not less than twenty-five times as much surface can be covered by the stranded galvanised wire suggested as would be by a single copper rod of one inch in diameter, such as is frequently used. In fact it is perfectly safe to state that, taking into consideration the increased amount of labour, and additional details and accessories, required for net-work system, quite twenty times better protection may be obtained for the same outlay.\n\n16. Many interesting illustrations of the inefficacy of single conductors for complete protection may be quoted from local records. In one instance, which came under the direct observation of the writer, some damage was done to the part of the roof of an extensive range of buildings on which three independent conductors were fitted. Such cases afford sufficient proof that single conductors do not effect their purpose in taking discharges quietly away; on the other hand there can only be negative evidence that buildings protected on the net-work system, with many points, are not liable to be damaged.\n\n17. The writer trusts that these notes will be of service and would conclude by making the following suggestions:\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 44, 1905\na. Use as many points as possible (paragraph 9)\u2014three short points placed ten feet apart on a roof ridge are much better than one elaborate and expensive three-pointed terminal.\n\nb. Use galvanised wire of small section and interconnect all points on the roof. The lighter the gauge of wire used the greater the area of roof covered for the same outlay. (paragraph 7).\n\nc. Avoid sharp bends and turns in the wire. Side flashes are apt to jump off from an abrupt bend or kink, which may cause damage to the adjacent masonry.\n\nd. Connect in the roof gutters. Actual jointing is unnecessary and it will usually be found convenient to have the wire from corner points laid along the guttering and thence through down pipes to earth.\n\ne. Take the earth connection away to a deep \"earth\" even if it is necessary to go a considerable distance from the building. The additional area of \"surface\" earth is useful, and the cost of wire and extra trenching is small.\n\nf. Avoid joints as much as possible. Joints between the ordinary points and the wire forming the conductor are frequently made disgracefully, and, in numerous instances, the writer has found an actual break in continuity. The difficulty of supervising explains this\u2014in fact the work is often left entirely to native workmen\u2014and the remedy which suggests itself is that of adopting some practically jointless system.\n\nPenang, September 10th, 1904.\nShort Notes.\n\nNote on the occurrence in Selangor of three Vertebrates new to the Malay Peninsula.\n\nAmong zoologists at home one constantly hears the remark that our knowledge of the vertebrate fauna of the Malay Peninsula must now be very nearly complete and that but few more species can remain to be added to our lists.\n\nHow wide this is of the true state of affairs is shewn by the fact that within the last month, the Dyak Collector attached to the Selangor Museum, has discovered two striking forms which although previously known from Borneo have not hitherto been recorded from the mainland of Asia.\n\nThe species are:\n\n1. *Draco maximus*, Blgr.\n\nThis fine species of flying lizard, the largest of the genus, was originally described by Mr. Boulenger (P. Z. S. 1893, p. 522, pl. xlii. fig. 1) from a single male specimen collected by Mr. Hose on Mt. Dulit, Sarawak at a height of 2000 feet. Specimens from the same locality and also from Mts. Matang and Penrissen are in the Sarawak Museum and there is a single female in this Museum, collected at Balingean, some distance up the Sarawak River.\n\nTwo individuals, male and female, were captured in deep jungle about nine miles from Kuala Lumpor and agree well with the original diagnosis and with the above-mentioned specimen from Balingean. In the freshly killed lizards the general colour above was moss-green, pale yellowish beneath; gular appendage of the male dull terracotta, the lateral folds black, streaked with white: in the female the appendage was very pale lemon yellow, which rapidly faded into white Total length of both specimens about 370 mm.\n\nJour. S. B. R. A. Soc., No. 44, 1905.\n2. *Chrysophlegma mystacale*, Salvad.\n\nAmong some miscellaneous bird-skins in the Museum I recently discovered a woodpecker collected by Dr. Duncker on the Semangko Pass, where the trunk road to Pahang crosses the main range at a height of 2700 feet. The specimen was shot on the 29th May 1901 and is sexed female, though this is probably an error of the native skinner. It appears to belong to a species described by Count Salvadori as *Chrysophlegma mystacale*, from collections made in the Padang mountains, West Sumatra, by the famous Italian Botanist Beccari. Subsequently it was obtained by Carl Bock, a Swedish Collector in the employ of Lord Walden in much the same locality, and later on by Dr. H. O. Forbes at Hoodjoong, in the mountains of the Palembang Residency, further to the south. Outside this very limited district I can find no records of its occurrence, and it is somewhat unexpected to find it reappearing in the mountains of the Peninsula, which possess a distinct species (*Chrysophlegma wrayi*) of their own.\n\nGeneral colour above bright olive green, darker on the head and crown, the latter tinged with rufous; nuchal crest, golden yellow. Beneath, greyish olive, darker on the chest and becoming almost black on the throat; chin with a slight rufous tinge. Sides of the head dark greenish grey, malar stripe very pale yellow. Primaries black, broadly barred with rufous, the innermost crimson on their outer webs exteriorly. Tail feathers black, the outermost with an oily lustre beneath Total length:\u201411 inches; wing 5.4.\n\n3. *Ptilocercus lowii*, Gray.\n\n**Pen-tailed Tree Shrew.**\n\nThe occurrence of this small mammal is of even greater interest than that of the preceding as it adds to the Peninsular list a genus that has hitherto been supposed to be specially characteristic of the Bornean group of islands. But even in Sarawak where the species was originally\ndiscovered some fifty years ago it seems to be rare and but little appears to have been recorded of its habits.\n\nOur specimen, an adult female, was captured in its nest in a hollow bough in the same jungle as Draco maximus. The nest was merely a tunnel about three inches in diameter and eighteen in length, roughly lined with fibrous material and with green leaves. The general colour of the animal is a pale greyish brown above, somewhat yellowish beneath with an ill-defined dark stripe running from the muzzle to a little beyond the eye. The tail is naked for two-thirds of its length and covered with scutes like that of a rat; the terminal third is clothed with whitish hair over half an inch in length, whence the trivial name of the species is derived.\n\nDimensions:\u2014Head and body, 133; tail, 167; ear 19; hind-foot, 34 mm. Examination of a series will not improbably prove that the Peninsular form is separable from the Bornean race, but distinctions based on an unique specimen are apt to be fallacious.\n\nH. C. Robinson.\n\nSelangor State Museum,\n\nKuala Lumpur.\n\nOccasional Notes.\n\nPratincola manra (Pall.)\n\nA specimen of the Indian Bush-chat was shot by Captain H. R. Baker at Stagmount, Singapore on Dec. 22, 1904. Hitherto it has been collected as far down as Mysore and the Andamans but Singapore must now be recorded as its most southerly extension. As the species is now included is the avifanna of the Malay Peninsula I give below a description of the plumage in which it was obtained locally.\n\nMale. Forehead, crown, nape, hind neck, back, scapulars, most of the wing-coverts, and upper rump black,\nbroadly margined with fulvous, the black predominating on the forehead and crown and the fulvous on the nape; the innermost wing-coverts pure white; primary wings coverts and winglet black edged with whitish; quills rusty black, the primaries narrowly, the other quill-broadly edged with pale rufous on the outer edge and tip; lower rump and tail-coverts white broadly tipped with orange-rufous; tail black, edged and tipped with pale rufous, broadest on the outer feathers; lores, sides of the head, chin and throat black, the feathers of the chin and throat strongly tipped with fulvous-white and a curved line of the same colour running from the nostrils over the eye; a patch of white feathers tipped with orange-rufous on each side of the neck; breast orange-rufous; remainder of the lower plumage pale rufous, palest on the centre of the abdomen and lower tail coverts; under wing-coverts and axillaries black with narrow white tips; inner edge of the wing quills whitish.\n\nIt is dark brown; bill and feet black (Capt. H. R. Baker). Length 130 millimetres; tail 53; wing 68; tarsus 20; bill from gape 16.\n\nC. Boden Kloss.\n\nNesting of the Little Grey Woodpecker.\n\nThe little grey woodpecker Jungipicus canicapillus is a very common bird in Singapore and may often be seen running about dead boughs in search of insects. The nest and eggs of it have however never been described. Captain H. R. Baker however espied one evidently nesting, in the dead bough of a tree (Vernonia arborea) in the Botanic Gardens at a height of about 15 feet from the ground. He first noticed it making the hole in the first week of March, and on the 24th he and I went to the tree and cut it across to get the eggs which were by them unfortunately almost ready to hatch. The eggs 2 in number were deposited at the bottom of the hole. Without any lining or attempt at a nest. They were rounded, but pointed at the small end and measured .67 by .54 and .65 by .54 respectively.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nThe bird must nest very frequently as it is so common and I have often seen it making holes in trees as if to nest and on one occasion, knew of one which seemed to roost regularly in a hole it had made in a dead bough, in the Gardens, where it could be seen every evening sitting in the mouth of the hole, but though it was the breeding season. I found neither eggs nor young birds in the nest.\n\nH. N. Ridley.\n\nNesting of *Draco Fimbriatus*.\n\nWhile walking along a jungle track in the forests at Rantan Panjang in Selangor, in August, I came across a nest of this large flying lizard. Mr. Burn-Murdoch who was walking in front called my attention to the eggs, and I found I had stepped on the female lizard which was sitting by the nest and was so much, the color of the dead leaves that I did not see it. The eggs four in number were laid in a depression apparently scooped out by the lizard in the sandy soil. They were oblong with rounded ends 15 mm. long and 8 or 9 mm. thick, quite white.\n\nH. N. Ridley.\n\nA Wasp attacking a Leaf-mining Caterpillar.\n\nIn December last I observed a small species of wasp, of the class that the Malays call Peningat, running about on a young mangosteen leaf which was attacked by a leaf-mining caterpillar. The upper epidermis of the leaf had been raised by the caterpillar on both sides of the midrib. The wasp about $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch long, was tearing the loosened epidermis and eventually crept underneath in pursuit of the grub, which was at the further end of its burrow. It was unable apparently to get across the midrib, and after searching about for sometime came out and as it seemed accidentally in running about on the upper surface of the leaf came across the larva. It immediately tore away the loose epidermis above it and seizing its prey flew off with it. The wasp is\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 44, 1905.\na common species which makes small nests on the under-side of leaves. It has dark red thoraces and a black abdomen with a single yellow ring. That many of the smaller wasps prey on caterpillars is well known. The peculiarity in this case was that it attacked a leaf-miner and absolutely followed up its burrow under the epidermis.\n\nH. N. Ridley.\n\nOn the Fertilization of Grammatophyllum.\n\nOn account of the fertilization of *Grammatophyllum speciosum* was published by myself in the Journal of the Linnean Society vol. xx p. 336, where it was shown that the black and red hornet *Vespa ciacta* was the usual agent in the transference of pollen from one flower to another. The orchid flowers in August and September and I note that this year in the Botanic Gardens Singapore none of these insects are about, but the wild bee *Apis dorsalis* is at work and is an equally good fertilizer. But the insects which are most abundant on and about the flowers are small hymenoptera too small to be able to touch the pollenmasses, and ants, and also the large carpenter bees, *Xylocopa aestuans* and *X. latipes*. These visit the flowers more abundantly than the Apis, going round to each newly opened flower and plunging into it to suck the honey from the base of the lip. These insects however do not remove the pollen, although there seems at first sight no reason for their not doing so. The reason for this is that the lip of the flower is moveable on its base, and though these carpenter bees, much thicker than the Vespa, and Apis would fill up the space between the lip and column were the lip immobile and so touch with their thoraces the pollen masses, their weight on the lip bends it down so that they do not quite touch it, and thus they back out of the flower without removing the pollen. In this case the mobility of the lip is really injurious to the flower, as it allows the carpenter bees to remove the honey without fertilizing the flower, and by so doing preventing an Apis or Vespa who might come later from visiting the honey-less flower. In the wild haunts of *Grammatophyllum* Xylocopas are as plentiful as Apis or Vespa and\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nwould be as good fertilizers, and it would appear that were the lip immobile the Grammatophyllum would secure the use of all three insects and avoid the loss of flowers through the removal of the honey without fertilization. The carpenter bees are thus harmful to this orchid, as it is to other flowers. By persistently tearing open the base of the corolla tube of *Ipomea palmata* to get the honey instead of pushing into the corolla mouth it effectually prevents this plant from being fertilized.\n\nA considerable number of flowers, especially of introduced plants, never set seed, for various often obscure reasons. In some cases however the failure is certainly due to the actions of insects who though taking pollen or honey fail to put the pollen on the stigma. An example is that of *Clerodendron macrosiphon* a native of Zanzibar. It is a shrub with long tubular white flowers with long projecting stamens. The flowers are evidently intended for fertilization by hawkmoths, but as it opens its flowers too early for them they are spoilt by the small Trigona bees who assiduously go round to each stamen and collect all the pollen, without touching the stigma, so that the plant has never so far as I have never seen here produced a single fruit.\n\nH.
