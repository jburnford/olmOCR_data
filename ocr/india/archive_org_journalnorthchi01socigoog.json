Dean Butcher, D.D., President.\nA. J. Little, Esq.,\nA. E. Hippisley, Esq., Vice-Presidents.\nChas. D. Whitty, Esq., Secretary.\nMax Slevogt, Esq., Treasurer.\nJoseph Haas, Esq., Librarian.\nD. C. Jansen, Esq., Curator.\nJohn Fryer, Esq.,\nT. W. Kingsmill, Esq.,\nD. J. Macgowan, Esq., M.D.,\nJ. Rhein, Esq.,\nC. Schmidt, Esq.,\nA. B. Stripling, Esq., Councilors.\n\nEarly in the year, the Very Rev. Dean Butcher, President, left Shanghai, and the Council have since been indebted to Mr. A. E. Hippisley, Vice-President, who presided in his place. Five meetings have been held during the year, and the following papers have been read:\n1.\u201427th January, \"On Siamese Coinage,\"\u2014by Joseph Haas, Esq.*\n\n2.\u20148th March, \"Remarks on the Middle Yangtze,\"\u2014by D. J. Macgowan, Esq., M.D.\n\n3.\u20147th June, \"Coins of the present Dynasty of China,\"\u2014by S. W. Bushell, Esq., M.D., Physician to H. B. M. Legation, Peking.\n\n4.\u201421st September, \"On the Naturalistic Philosophy of China,\"\u2014by Frederic H. Balfour, Esq., Professor of English at the Imperial Japanese Legation, Peking.\n\n5.\u2014\"On the Geology of Takow, Formosa,\"\n\n6.\u2014\"On the Geology of the Pescadores,\"\n\n7.\u2014\"On the Hydrology of the Yangtze, the Yellow River, and the Peiho,\"\u2014by H. B. Guppy, Esq., M.B., Surgeon to H. M. S. Hornet.\n\n8.\u201419th November, \"Early European Researches into the Flora of China,\"\u2014by E. Bretschneider, Esq., M.D., Imperial Russian Legation, Peking.\n\nBaron Ferdinand von Richthofen and Colonel N. Prejevalsky have been elected Honorary Members of the Society, in recognition of the eminent services rendered by them to the geography of Central Asia and China. Count Bela Sz\u00e9ch\u00e9nyi, the head of the Austro-Hungarian Expedition to Western China, and Mr. Herbert A. Giles, of H.B.M. Consular Service, have been nominated Corresponding Members.\n\nThe death of the Rev. S. R. Brown, D.D., formerly a resident of Yokohama, has deprived the Society of an old and distinguished Corresponding Member, and the Council also regret to record the death of three ordinary members, one of whom, Mr. G. G. Lowder, for some time acted as Hon. Secretary to the Society. Five members have resigned during the year, and eleven new members have been elected; the following shows the numerical strength of the Society at the end of the year:\u2014Honorary Members, 16; Corresponding do., 23; Resident do., 38; Non-Resident do., 73. Total, 150.\n\n* Published in the Society's Journal, Vol. XIV. 1879.\nThese figures go far to prove that the object of the Society and the benefits it offers to all cultured and thoughtful men are not sufficiently recognised by our resident community. It is true that during the year under review the meetings of the Society have been far better attended than during preceding years, but to be really prosperous we need the support of a wider circle of friends than are now found on the list of resident members.\n\nUnder the superintendence of Mr. Haas, the Honorary Librarian, the collection of books forming the Society's Library has been transferred to the present Lecture-hall, the circulation of the books being now under the control of the Committee of the Shanghai Library, and it speaks well for the new arrangement that the collection is now more generally used than has been the case formerly.\n\nA new catalogue of the Library has been issued, and the Society's Journal for 1880 is in course of publication, under the editorship of Messrs. Hippisley and Haas.\n\nThe usual reports of the Librarian, Treasurer, and Curator of the Museum are appended.\n\n31st December, 1880.\nLIST OF MEMBERS.\n\n(JULY 1881.)\n\nHONORARY.\n\nHis Majesty Leopold II., King of the Belgians.\n\nAloock, Sir Rutherford, K.C.B., London.\nHart, Robert, Esq., C.M.G., Peking.\nLegge, Rev.

From the enclosed Balance Sheet it will be seen that the total income of the Society during 1880 amounted to Mex. $864.13, the current expenses to Mex. $455.32, leaving a Credit Balance of Mex. $408.81 in the hands of your Treasurer. During the year 98 Subscriptions, producing Mex. $710, have been collected, as against Mex. $645 received in 1879. 28 Subscriptions are still due from Non-Resident Members, but I do not anticipate that these arrears will bring in more than about Mex. $80. An amount of Mex. $136.90 has likewise been received for copies of Journals sold by Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner & Co., London, and it is hoped that the arrangement recently concluded with our local Agents will help to increase the Society's income from this source.\n\nThe reduced cost of the Journal for 1879 is the principal cause of last year's disbursements contrasting favorably with the expenditure of former years; on the other hand our expenses for Fire-Insurance, repairs to the building, advertisements and book-binding have been somewhat heavier than usual. The Society have no outstanding liabilities at present but early in the year about Mex. $90 will become due for printing the new Catalogue of the Library and the cost of the Journal for 1880 will form a very conspicuous item in the expenditure of the current year.\nAs regards the Museum, its existence is dependent upon the liberal contributions received from the English and French Municipal Councils, and it is to be hoped that our two Municipalities will continue to assist an Institution so deserving of support and which is a source of pleasure and instruction to a large part of our community. During the year the receipts of the Museum amounted to Mex. $851.37, the expenditure to Mex. $709.24, of which Mex. $102.46 properly belong to the previous year, being amount of rent due to the Shanghai Library for the 6 Months ending 31st December, 1879. A Credit Balance is thus shown amounting to Mex. $142.13 = Tls. 103.09, which are duly lodged with the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. In the matter of outstanding liabilities the Museum is less fortunately situated than the parent Institution, its indebtedness on 31st December, 1880 being as follows:\n\nTo Recreation Fund: Interest on Loan of Tls. 1500, three years at 5 per cent per annum, ... Tls. 225.\nTo W. B. Pryer, Esq., Sundry Expenses for Museum, due since 1875, $51.39, ... ... ... Tls. 37.37\n\nTls. 262.37\n\nMAX SLEVOGT,\nHon.

Although this arrangement may at first sight appear to be one-sided, it is really in favour of the Society, as from want of a Librarian residing on the premises, the collection of books has been practically inaccessible in the past. If in future the number of readers should not increase, it will be due to lack of interest rather than owing to defects in the management of the Library.\n\nTo facilitate the supervision of the books, the collection has been removed to the Lecture-hall on the ground-floor of the Society's building and the Library itself has been put into better order.\n\nIn accordance with the terms of the agreement entered into with the Shanghai Library a hand-list of works contained in the Society's collection has been prepared, corrected up to 31st December 1880, and the same shows 991 Nos. to which must be added the 1023 Chinese volumes of the Wylie Library and the collections of works on Natural History which remain under the charge of the Museum authorities.\n\nAs will be seen from the annexed list of additions received at the Library during the past year, the Society has again not been able to acquire any works by purchase, which is to be regretted, as the collection, although rich in early works on China and the Far East, shows some important lacunae as regards publications of a more modern date. The names of Ritter, Lassen, Yule, Koeppen, Beal, Palladius and Prejevalsky will be looked for in vain on the pages of our Catalogue, not to mention numerous other works which are indispensable to every scientific Library in the East.\nOn the other hand the accessions to the Library, received in the way of exchanges or as donations from Governments, Publishers and private individuals, have been neither few nor unimportant, as a glance at the appended list will show.\n\nForemost in rank, both as regards the donor and the value of the donation, stands the magnificent work on Boro-Boudour, presented to the Society by H. E. the Netherlands' Minister for the Colonies, the full title of which is as follows:\n\nBuddhist Architectural Remains in Java:\n\n\"Boro-Boudour,\" dans l'Ile de Java, dessin\u00e9 par F. C. Wilson, avec texte explicatif et descriptif, r\u00e9dig\u00e9 d'apr\u00e8s les m\u00e9moires M. S. S. et imprim\u00e9s de F. C. Wilson, J. F. G. Brumund et autres documents, publi\u00e9s par C. Leemans.\n\n2 vols. 8vo of text (French and Dutch), with 17 plates and 8 royal folio volumes of 393 large plates, containing about 1000 separate designs.\u2014Leide, 1874.\n\nBernard Quaritch says in relation to this work (Book List No. 47):\n\n\"This grand work, published by order of the Dutch Colonial Office, illustrates the ruins of an ancient temple first discovered in 1814, which forms a splendid monument of Buddhist architecture in Java in the eighth or ninth century of our era. It attests the magnificent civilisation of the ancient Indo-Javanese dynasties that ruled the island before the arrival of Mahommedan conquerors, and adds an important contribution to the history of Buddhism and its developments in Art. The sculptures are treated in detail in the text, so that the latter has grown into an extensive work on the historical and traditional life of Buddha, the ancient history of India, and the history of Java during the sixth to the fourteenth century.\"\n\nThe number of Scientific Institutions with whom the Society exchanges publications has been further extended during the year, and the list now comprises some 30 Societies in Europe, America and Asia.\nTo Dr. E. Behm, the Editor of Dr. A. Petermann's Geographische Mittheilungen, Guido Cora, the well-known Italian Geographer, Dr. Sourindro Mohun Tagore of Calcutta, who presented the Society with 26 of his works on Hindu Poetry and Music, to the Inspector General of the Imp. Chinese Maritime Customs, to the Rev. Father M. Dechevrens, S. J., the learned Director of the Zi-Ka-Wei observatory, and to several other valued authors, whose names will be found in the annexed list, the Library is indebted for many important contributions, and while it is hoped that the interest thus shown in the welfare of the Society will be maintained, I trust that others will come forward and help us to fill up the blanks which at present somewhat detract from the value of the Library.\n\nJOSEPH HAAS,\nHon.

The book kept there shows that more than three hundred persons visited it during the year; but this, I must mention, very inadequately represents the total number who have done so, few indeed regard the request of entering their names. The donations, which have been made during that period, more than equal, both point of number and scientific interest, those of the preceding year. A detailed list of them is attached to this report, and I venture to suggest, that in the interest of the Society, it would be desirable that this should be published in extenso, together with the contributors' names, in its Annual Report; so that an official recognition may be given which will probably be more generally esteemed than the simple announcements hitherto limited to the daily journals.\n\nI think it only right to specially call the attention of the Society to the extensive and valuable collection of specimens illustrative of the geology of China presented to the Museum during the year, and for which we are indebted to Dr. H. Guppy, of H.B.M.'s ship Hornet. This forms by far the most complete series which has hitherto been received; and the intrinsic value is enhanced by the locality being attached to each specimen, and by the nomenclature being given in many cases, upon the authority of the contributor. If a transient visitor has been able to make so valuable a collection with such slight opportunities, how great a field is open to resident and corresponding members of the Society, either personally or through the medium of their friends at the out-ports, to largely aid in acquiring a knowledge of this neglected but most important branch of the scientific history of this immense empire.\nSome highly interesting geological specimens from Corea and Russian Siberia have also been presented by Capt. G. C. Anderson, of the s.s. Appin, and we are indebted to the same gentleman for specimens of seaweed, shells, and other objects of scientific interest.\n\nMany other gentlemen whose names appear in the list have given us assistance with regard to Ornithology, Entomology, &c., and in addition to the thanks which will I feel sure be cordially voted by the members to the various contributors, I would suggest that a special letter of acknowledgement be forwarded by the President to each of them, and that this course should be adopted in future, immediately on the receipt of any donation; and, also, that when possible, the conventional and scientific names of any specimen received should be specially included in the letter acknowledging it.\n\nA great opportunity for expansion has been afforded us by the acquisition of another room placed at the disposal of the Museum by the removal of the Society's Library, consequent on its transfer to the custody of the Shanghai Library. We have, however, refrained from utilizing the extra space thus afforded us until our financial position for the coming year had been determined; considerable expenditure having become necessary for converting some of the old show cases and the purchase of new ones.\n\nWith the re-arrangement and enlargement which we are now in a position to commence, I think new spirit might be infused and a greater impetus given to the affairs of the Museum by the assumption of the functions of Curator by several members, in place of by one individual as heretofore; each taking that province with which he is most familiar, or in which he is most interested. Let, for example, Zoology and Botany be undertaken by one, Geology by another, and Technology by a third. By such an arrangement a kind of committee would be constituted, each member of which would be able to call upon his friends for assistance in procuring specimens and information relating to his particular department; which would, consequently, be benefited by the closer and more competent attention he could devote to its interests, and that, too, without any great tax on his leisure.\n\nI cannot too strongly urge upon your attention the value which a good Technological collection would possess, or the easy and inexpensive manner in which it might be acquired. Specimens of all the products of Chinese labour, whether in agriculture, arts, or manufactures, would form a most interest-\ning and suggestive collection; and I have no doubt that these could be procured through the medium of the several Consuls, and especially of the Custom House officials, in the different open ports; and that we might confidently rely\u2014if proper application were made him\u2014on the cordial co-operation of the Inspector-General of Customs, whose love of science and interest in the advancement of Chinese affairs would enlist his sympathies in our scheme. The formation of such a collection would impart new life to the institution and give interest and variety to its now somewhat monotonous exhibit, composed mostly of specimens of the Zoology of this province. The labour of arranging the specimens in cases would be but a small part of the work required in collecting each exhibit. The history, description, uses, and methods of preparation of its many interesting products should be gleaned\u2014studious examination made\u2014and the resulting information published for the public benefit. The collection would embrace the direct products of Chinese labour in their marketable state; that is, as they are produced and offered for sale by the farmer, artisan, or manufacturer. In arranging such a collection a classification should be adopted that is simple and at the same time comprehensive, and as we are limited both in means and space, it would be as well, perhaps, for us to confine ourselves to obtaining specimens for the three following simple divisions:\n\n1st.\u2014All food substances.\n\n2nd.\u2014Substances used in the arts and manufactures.\n\n3rd.\u2014Natural History in relation to the production of the above.\n\nFor instance, in the 1st Dept. we might arrange cereals and legumes, fruits and vegetables, farinaceous substances, sugar, beverages, liquors, narcotics, spices, and condiments.\n\nIn the 2nd Dept. we could place all animal fibres, vegetable fibres, paper materials, dyes, colouring and painting materials, tanning materials, gums and resins, fats, oils and wax, medicines, etc.\n\nThe 3rd Dept. would embrace natural History in relation to or in any way connected with the production of the above, such as farm animals, animals found upon the farm in a wild state, animals denominated as \"farm pests,\" and those useful as furnishing food, or from their destroying insects, domestic poultry, game birds, hybrids. Birds\u2014beneficial or injurious\u2014insects injurious to vegetation, arranged in regard to the plants on\nwhich they feed, together with artificial means of destruction, etc., etc.\n\nI am aware that the utilitarian character of such a collection will strike some of the members of the Society as being foreign to the original design of the Museum. Still I venture to hope that before throwing the suggestion aside as useless or impracticable, it will receive due consideration from the officers and members. We receive Tls. 600 a year from the Ratepayers of the English and French Settlements of Shanghai under the idea of the Museum being a public benefit. But the accumulated contributions of the few years it has been in existence are nearly all so purely scientific that, while presenting points of interest to a few lovers of science, they possess but little else to recommend them to the general public. The Technological department suggested would, however, be of a more practical turn, and while but slightly interfering with the present routine of the institution would, I feel sure, be a benefit to the public at large; and while interesting to all, an honorable addition to our little Museum.\n\nD.

I have thought that a critical review of these accounts in the light of modern science and a republication of some of them, which I found hidden in ancient periodicals, now little known and difficult of access, would prove of some interest and be even practically useful to collectors of Chinese plants and writers on the same subject.\n\nAlthough many of the celebrated Chinese vegetable productions are mentioned in the book of Marco Polo and by other European mediaeval travellers in China, I do not intend to trace our early acquaintance with Chinese plants back as far as the middle ages. In my investigations I shall start from that period when these regions became first known to us through the learned and hard-working Jesuit missionaries, the illustrious pioneers of Oriental studies in the far East. On the other side, I shall not extend the area of my researches beyond the Linn\u00e6an period.\n\n* Read before the Society on the 19th November, 1880,\nI.\u2014BOTANICAL INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO CHINA SUPPLIED BY THE JESUITS.\n\nI may premise, although these facts are generally known, that, after the Portuguese had made their appearance in Chinese waters in the beginning of the 16th century (Raphael Pestrello in 1516, Ferd. Andrade 1517), they subsequently established factories at Ningpo, carrying on trade also with Amoy. Besides this they settled near Canton and at Macao which latter place on account of its favourable situation soon became the basis and the starting point for the commercial enterprises of the Portuguese in Eastern Asia. It is also well known that Francis Xavier was the first Jesuit missionary, who ventured to visit China in 1552, but he died in the same year on an island called Sangian in sight of the Chinese coast. Nearly 30 years elapsed before a new attempt was made by the Jesuits to gain a footing in China. From 1581 to 1583 they sent successively four missionaries to Macao. One of them was Matthaeus Ricci, who holds one of the most conspicuous places in the history of the Chinese missions. By persevering efforts he obtained permission to reside at Peking, where he arrived in A.D. 1600. At the time of Ricci's death, in 1610, the number of Jesuit missionaries in China had already considerably increased and we find them then working in many parts of the Empire, (besides Peking), namely at Canton, at Shao chow fu (Kuang tung province), at Nanking, Shanghai, Su chow fu, Sung kiang fu (all in the province of Kiang nan [Kiang su]), in which they then had altogether 90 churches; at Hang chow fu (Che kiang prov.); at Nan ch'ang fu (Kiang si prov.). In the provinces of Hu kuang and Sse ch'wan they had also built many churches and it appears, that at that time there were missionaries also in Fu chou fu and in some places of the province of Shao si. They were not only assiduously labouring to learn the language and to preach the gospel, but they employed themselves also in acquiring knowledge of the customs of the people and their literary works and they directed their attention likewise to the features of the country and its natural productions etc. The Jesuit missionaries have always had the well-merited reputation of great learning and of a classical and scientific education; and it seems that those, who were sent to convert the Chinese, had been especially trained with the object of convincing the latter, by means of striking experiments,\nof the superiority of western science, and of demonstrating to them the accuracy of Europeans in observing natural phenomena, and their ingenuity in making the laws of nature serviceable to the purposes of industry, economy and the arts. The early success enjoyed by the propaganda of the Jesuits in China was principally due to the great authority they had acquired at the Court of Peking on account of their skill in astronomy, physics, chemistry etc. Many of these distinguished scholars used to investigate with a strong inclination objects of natural history, and thus we find in the collections of the letters and memoirs of the Jesuits in China a great number of articles treating of mineralogy, zoology, and botany, supplying a mass of most valuable information. The circumstances, in which they lived among the natives, becoming familiar with the language and adopting the native customs, gave them many more facilities for gathering information than travellers or naturalists of the present time, who are looked upon with suspicion, constantly watched, and often molested by the people. There are still in the interior of China many common Chinese plants, known to us only from the description of the Jesuits, as for example the tree, which yields the varnish for making the well known Chinese lacquered ware, or the *Illicium anisatum* of China (Lourseiro). No specimens of these trees have, as far as I can judge from what has been published with respect to Chinese plants, come to the notice of later botanists.* I need hardly say, that the accounts left by the early missionaries, concerning Chinese botany, have for the greater part no claim to be considered scientific papers in our modern sense. Their descriptions however of the plants applied by the natives to economic or other useful purposes, and also of wild-growing medicinal and other remarkable plants, are generally quite satisfactory and popularly correct. The Chinese names are often added. In most of the cases there can be no doubt what plant they meant and we are thus enabled to supply the respective scientific names, as far as these plants are known to botanists.\n\nIt does not seem, that any botanical collection was sent from China to Europe by the Jesuit missionaries previous to the middle of the 18th century. Father d\u2019Incarville, who resided\n\n---\n\n* I shall treat at greater length of these and similar botanical questions relating to China in a more comprehensive treatise on Chinese botany, which is now in course of preparation.\nin Peking between 1740 and 1757, appears to have been the first who collected plants and seeds for his instructor Bernh de Jussieu, as will be shown in a subsequent chapter.\n\nThe scope of this paper is not intended to give a full account of all that has been written by the Jesuits in China on botanical matters. That would unduly swell the limits of this chapter; I shall draw up merely a list of their works or scattered minor articles dealing with the vegetable productions of the Middle Kingdom, selecting only a few memoirs, presenting a particular interest for a more detailed review, reproducing occasionally the text in the original.\n\nBut before proceeding to a chronological survey of these publications of the ancient Jesuit fathers, one of the earliest works on China, published before their advent, deserves to be noticed here.\n\nJ. GONZALEZ de MENDOZA'S HISTORY OF THE GREAT AND MIGHTY KINGDOM OF CHINA was first printed in Spanish, in 1585, in Rome. An English version of the book (to which I refer) was published in 1633 by the Hakluyt Soc. Mendoza, an Augustin monk, had himself never seen China. The material for his book has been derived from the reports of some friars of the same order, who had found opportunity to visit China. He depends mainly upon the accounts furnished by the monk Martin de Hervada, who had been taken, in 1575, by a Spanish ship from Manila to the Chinese port of Ts'ien chou fu (prov. of Fu kien) where he was allowed to spend three months. The information given in this little book with respect to the vegetable productions of China (I, 14. 15. 82.) are very meagre but not devoid of interest. The excellence of the Chinese Chestnuts is there praised and there is noticed also the great abundance of large Melons. We are further told that \"the Chinese have a kind of Plum, that they call Ischia, of an excellent gallant taste.\" This is, I think, the first mention made by Europeans of Litchi (Nephelium Litchi Camb.). We are further more informed in the same work that the Chinese, besides Wheat, Barley, Millet (panizo), cultivate also the same Maize, which constitutes the principal food of the Indians in Mexico. This latter statement made at so early a date has a peculiar interest for us, for it is now a well-established fact that Maize is not indigenous to China but has been introduced since the discovery of America.\n\nOne of the earliest accounts given of the Chinese Empire by Jesuit missionaries is that by ALV. SEMEDO. He was of Portuguese origin, born 1585, arrived in China in 1613,\nand died in Macao in 1658.) As he himself states in the preface to his RELATIONE DELLA GRANDE MONARCHIA DELLA CINA, he wrote this work about 1633, but it was first published only in 1643, in Rome. I quote in the following the French translation of it made by Coulon 1645, but translate the quoted passages into English.\n\nThe following are the remarks of Semedo concerning Chinese plants:\n\n1. The Peaches of the province of Xensi (Shensi) are of prodigious size, some of them of a red color outside as well as inside, others yellow and resembling our peaches. The same province is also famed for its Grapes. (p. 8.)\n\n2. The province of Honan produces the best Apricots. (p. 22.)\n\n3. The prov. of Xan tung (Shan tung) abounds in large and excellent Pears (p. 29.)\n\nThese large pears are already mentioned by Marco Polo (Yule ed. 2. II 164.\n\n4. There is a kind of fruit grown everywhere in China, which they call su su in their language. The Portuguese use to term it red Fig. It bears however no resemblance to a fig, for it is of a red color outside, contains a gold-colored pulp and seeds resembling almond kernels. Its shape is that of an orange but it varies in size. It has the skin very soft and is of a delicious flavour. The best are grown in the colder parts of China, vis. in the provinces of Honan, Xensi (Shensi), Xian si (Shan si), Xan tung (Shan tung) and especially in the last named, where they use to dry them and send them off to the other provinces of the Empire. When dried this fruit resembles somewhat our figs, but it is superior in flavor. (p. 7.)\n\nThis is without doubt the Diospyros Kaki L. (D. Schitze. Bgo.) a very common fruit tree all over China, where a great many varieties of it are cultivated. The Chinese name of the fruit is \u6843\u5b50 shi tse', in the Amoy dialect su tsu.\n\n5. The Jesuit Father Ferraris in his Hesperides (publ. in 1646) p. 430, describes an Aurantium sinense olivae magnitudinis figuraque olivae, referring to Semedo. This is probably Citrus japonica Thb., var. fructu elliptico, of which Semedo seems to have communicated some account to Ferraris.\n\n---\n\n* The biographical notices given in this paper concerning the Jesuit missionaries, are for the greater part derived from the pamphlet published in 1873 by the Jesuits at Shanghai under the title of Catalogus Patrum ac Fratrum e Sec. Jovis qui in Sinis adlaboraverunt.\n6. The province of Han chu (probably Hang chou fu, the capital of Chekiang, is meant), produces a peculiar fruit called yam mai by the natives. It is of the size of a plum, of a globular shape and resembles in color and taste the mulberry. The tree to which this fruit belongs bears however no resemblance to the mulberry tree. (p. 8.)\n\nThe author means the Myrica sapida Wall., a common fruit in Chekiang, in Chinese \u694a\u6885 yang mei.\n\n7. The province of Peking produces Maize, Wheat and some Rice for the use of the Emperor's court, the mandarins and the soldiers. An excellent kind of rice, which they eat boiled in water, without other ingredients, comes from Nan-k'ing. (p. 5. 3Q.)\n\nThis is the rice known under the name of glutinous rice. In Peking it is called \u7cef\u7c73 Kiang mi.\n\n8. The island of Hai nan produces the famous odoriferous Eaglewood and the wood called hua li mo by the natives, Rosewood by the Portuguese. (p. 13.)\n\nAccording to Loureiro (Fl. cochin. 327.) the Aloewood (or Eaglewood) of Cochinchina is yielded by Aloxyylon Agallocha, but nobody after Loureiro has seen this tree. In India Aquilaria Agallocha Roxb. is said to produce Aloewood.\u2014The wood which the Chinese call \u82b1\u68a8\u6728 hua li mu is well known in this country and sold even at Peking, but the tree by which it is produced is unknown to botanists.\n\n9. Belle-Isle (thus Semedo terms Formosa) produces Pepper which grows in the forests. Cinnamon is found there in the mountains. The Camphor trees of this island attain an extraordinary height. China-root and Salsapariglia are also found there. (p. 15.)\n\nCamphortrees (Cinnamomum Camphora. Nees) are indeed a prominent feature of Formosa. Chinese Cinnamon (Cinnamomum Cassia Bl. and other species) is known to grow in the provinces of Kuanhsi and Kui chou. I am not aware that modern travellers have noticed it in Formosa. China-root is Smilas China, L. and other species.\n\n10. The Rhubarb plant is found in the province of Xenai (Shensi). It grows to a considerable height. Its leaves are larger than those of cabbage. (p. 23.)\n\nAt the time of the Ming dynasty the present department of Si ning fu, still famed for its Rhubarb, belonged to the province of Shensi.\n\n11. In the province of Liao tung a root is produced which is sold at the double price of its weight in silver. It is a marvellous medicine, which is able to increase the strength of the frame and to restore the exhausted animal powers. The Chinese call it Gin sem. (p. 31.)\nThis is it seems the earliest mention made by a European author of the celebrated *Gin song Panax Ginseng* C. A. Mey., sin. \u9ebb\u9ec4\u6839. \u2014 Liao tung is an ancient name for the present Shin king or Chinese Manchuria.\n\n12. They have a kind of fragrant flowers, called *la mui*, which appear in winter after the leaves have fallen. They are of a yellow color and waxlike appearance.\n\n*Chimonanthus fragrans* Lindl. sinice: \u8721\u6885 la mei. It puts forth its flowers in December, in Peking. (p. 9.)\n\n13. They have also a kind of lily (*Lys.*) which they term *tiao hua* and keep it in their houses. For these plants thrive and blossom in the air with their imperishable roots out of the ground (p. 6.)\n\nAccording to Bridgman's Chin. Chrestom. (resp. Dr. Williams) p. 458 (6). \u540a\u82b1 tiao hua (hanging flower) is the Chinese name for the Airplant. The latter is a general name for several species of *Aridae* and *Vanda*, possessing the peculiar property of existing many months suspended in air.\n\n14. Large boats loaded with *Lamp-wicks* are frequently met on the rivers in China. These lamp-wicks are made from the pith of a rush, which the Chinese know how to take out. This rush is, as Dr. Hance has first proved, (Journ. of Botany 1875 p. 106) the *Juncus effusus* L.\n\n15. Semedo is the first of the missionaries who notices the *Tea* plant in China and who gives some account of the preparation of the leaves and their use. He states that *Cha* (\u8336) is the name of the leaf of a tree, which resembles the Myrtle etc. (p. 27.)\n\n16. Semedo mentions also (p. 7.) among the fruits of Canton and Fukien the *Lichi* (*Nephelium Litchi*, see above Mendoza) and first speaks of the *Lum yen* (*Nephelium Langan*. Camb. sin: \u7c9f\u773c lung yen.)\n\n17. Finally Semedo reports (p. 4.) that the Chinese have an excellent *Varnish*, which they call *charam*, and which is yielded by a tree.\n\nThere can be no doubt, that S. means the famed Chinese varnish, sin. \u6f06\u6f06, produced by a kind of *Rhus*, but I am not prepared to give any explanation, with respect to *charam*, which cannot be a Chinese name. He repeats the same name on p. 13. Constancio in his Dicionario da lingua Portuguesa states that this term, still in use in Portugal to designate Chinese Varnish, is of Asiatic origin.\n\nWe come next to MARTINI's famous *ATLAS SINENSIS*. Martinus Martini was born in 1614 at Trent (Southern Tyrol, Austria.). He arrived in China 1643, returned in 1653 to Europe by way of Batavia and landed at Amsterdam, where he made arrangements for publishing his\nwork. After this he proceeded to China again and died at Hang chou fu (Che kiang) in 1661.\n\nThe first edition of Martini's Novus Atlas Sinensis, published in Latin, bears no date but the concession for printing is dated Vienna January 7, 1655. This work is a short geographical description of the provinces of China, translated it seems from a Chinese work, but the author has added also many of his personal observations. I shall extract those passages relating to the vegetable productions of the different provinces.\n\n1. Territorium urbis Peking producit optima Poma, Pyra, Pruna, Frumenti ac Milii non parum, Leguminum omnis fere genera. Nuces adhaec habet et Castaneas, nec non Ficus et Uvas, ex quibus tamen vinum non coctiunt. (p. 32.)\n\n2. Provincia Kantung, (Shan tang) producit optima varii generis Pyra, Castaneas, nucesque aliae, Prunorum verum vim tantam, ut sicota ea siouti et pyra recentia, cum reliquis communicet provinciis: ad haco pomi ibi genus est, su os vocant incolae, quod licet in aliis reperiatur provinciis, illic tamen abundat magis. (I omit the detailed description of the fruit.) (p. 53.)\n\nBy Martini's Plums we have probably to understand Jujubes for which the province of Shantung is famed as well as for the shi tes (tsu tsu, comp. above Semedo 4.). The description Martini gives of the Diospyros Kaki is in accordance with Semedo's account of the same fruit.\n\n3. Urbs Tung chuen (Ss' ch'nan prov.). Magnus Castanearum ac Prunorum ubique proventus, sed et Sacari canes fert. (p. 70.)\n\n4. Urbs Quei te (Honan prov.). Grumata hic sunt praestansissima a quorum copia ac praestantia ultima civitas Xe ching nomen habet, quasi dicas pomorum granatorum moenia. (p. 60.)\n\nThe Chinese name of the Pomegranate is \u77f3\u69b4 shi liu, but the name of the city to which M. evidently alludes is \u67cf\u57ce che ch'eng hsien and this name has nothing to do with the pomegranate.\n\n5. Urbs Tali (prov. Yunnan). In hoc tractu Ficus nascentur Europaeae, quas Sinae vu hoa quo dicunt, ex eo indito nomine, quod nullo praevio flore ut reliqui fructus solent crescet, Vu hoa enim \"sine flore\" significat, \"quo\" vere fructum. (p. 158.)\n\nThe common Fig, Ficus Carica L., sin. \u7121\u82b1\u679c vu hua kuo (fruit without previous flowers) is cultivated throughout China, but is not indigenous there.\n\n6. Martini speaks of the superior quality of the Grapes in the prov. of Shansi. The natives do not use them for making wine, as the missionaries do, but only dry them in order to sell these raisins all over China. (p. 37.)\n7. Urbs Foohou (prov. Fo kien). Maxima est in australibus hujus provinciae partibus et praesepie in hujus urbis territorio copia fructus illius quem Lichi vocant, Lusitani Macenses Lichias dicunt. Nascitur in magnis procerisque arboribus, quarum folia Lauri imitantur, e ramoram summestibus racemi prodeant, in his ut in uvis fructus est, sed rarius ac longioribus pedunculis dependet. Fructus figura omnino croculum referit, magnitudine nucem aquat juglandem, parvum strobulum seu nucem pineam repraesentat, squamoso sed non adeo crassae cortice, nam ad membranae tantum crassitatem accedit, adeoque vel sola manu facile detrahitur. Intus succulentus est nucleus albi coloris saporis ac odoris rosacei suavissimi, cum maturae est fructus purpureus est coloris, videaturque ipsae arbores purpureae circumquaque quasi cordibus ornatae, amoenissimo aspectu astantium oculis arridere. Os seu calculum caro intus ambit, ac circumdat, qui quo mole minor est, eo constet fructus melior ac praestantior. Recte hunc fructum regem fructuum dici posse, saepe ego mecum cogitavi, qui quasi osui ac spectantium voluptati natus tantum esset, ita delectat, ut numquam satiet. (p. 122.)\n\nUrbs Ping lo (prov. Quang si). Lichiarum fructus magna ubique copia, cujus arbores Li pa civitati nomen dederant. (p. 145.)\n\nAlter etiam fructus quidam rotundus est, cortice superiori hand abdimilis, lung yen, hoc est draconis oculum, vocant; superiori mole non aequalis est, paulo minor ac rotundior, ut cerasa fere nostra majora, pelle tamen aliquantulum lichi duriori magisque squamosa constat. Utrumque etiam Sin\u00e6 exsiccant et ex hac provincia (Fo kien) per totum imperium ad delicias etiam suos distrahitur, nullo tamen modo cum recentibus comparari potest, cum suavisissimus ille succus totus fere exhalarit. Ex lichi etiam exprimitur liquor, quattuor vinum Sinenses vocant, suave satis sed rarius (p. 122.)\n\nEst et fructus in hoc territorio quem Sin\u00e6 Mei gie li vocant, i.e. pulchrae mulieris pruna saque, magna sunt ac praestantia quae Damascena illis magnitudine ac praestantia superant, figura rotunda magis quam elliptica aut ovali. (p. 122.)\n\nThe fruits here mentioned Nephelium Litchi. Camb and Nephelium Leucos-Camb. The \u7f8e\u4eba\u679c mei jin li is evidently a Plum.\n\n8. Urbs Chang chou (prov. Fo kien). In hujus ac superioris urbis (Te'han chou fu) territorio uberrime proveniant Poma aurea nobilissima, mole ac magnitudine Europ\u00e6ae majoribus paria, odore, suavitate atque aromatitate ea omnia insignissimo superant intervallo; nec arboris figura aut modus a nostratis\nmultum discrepat, sed fere par est, fractus vero in eo differt, quod comestus uvam omnino referat, quam muschatam vocant, ejusdem enim plane odoris ac saporis est, adeo ut suavius quidnam in hoc genere nec Italia hactenus, nec Hispania viderit aut gustabit. Ita vero hic fructus a natura est comparatus ut aureum suum densiorumque corticem facile dimittat, pulpa vero intra pelliculas, quibus vestitur ac distinguatur, eadem facilitate in particulas suas dividitur. Eundem fructum simul cum cortice inter aseres pressum sacco condunt, totoque anno adseruant neque Sinas suos tantum, sed et exteroros his deliciis pascunt ac recreant. (p. 125.)\n\nUrba Chang te. (prov. Hu quang). Poma aurea omnis generis profert, inter quae illa sunt quae hyberna a Sinis vocantur. Cum enim jam cessant reliqua, haec primum hyeme maturescunt et suavissimi sunt saporis. (p. 86.)\n\nThe first of the Orange here described is that known among European residents in China under the name of Mandarin-orange, the rind of which separates spontaneously from the pulp. The other may be the so-called Coolie-orange known by its closely adhering skin.\n\n9. Provincia Quang tung. Poma aurea hic ac Citria omnis generis sunt, etiam praestantissima illa quae supra in prov. Fo kien descripta est. Unum praetera genus est particularis, Yeu fu Sinse vocant, Lusitani Jambu, Hollandi Pampelmuses. In spinosis arboribus ut limonia poma solent nascuntur, arbores tamen illis majoribus sunt, flores etiam similes omnino alboque proferunt suavissimi odoris ex quibus aqua etiam fragrantissima destillatoria arte elicetur; fractus autem citria omnia etiam illa maxima longe superat magnitudine, quippe qui capitis humani molem aut sequent aut excedat. Cortex reliquis pomis aureis similis est colore, pulpa interna rubescit, dulcedinem aliqua aciditate permixtum obtinet uromaque sapore refert non omnino maturam, propterque ex eo etiam liquor pro potu exprimi solet, uti in Europa ex cerasis, pyris ac pomis pro sicera: suspensus domi fructus ad annum perdurat. (p. 131.)\n\nThis is the Citrus decumana. L. sin: \u67d1\u5b50 yu tsai'.\n\n10. Urba Chang te (prov. Hu quang). Habent etiam Cedros illas, quas Idolii manum vocant, extremitates enim illarum in candulas aliquas con in digitos ac pedunculos desinant. Esui apti non sunt, at domi intra cubiculum suspendi suavissimum exhalant odorem, quam obrem sacculos reticulato operi ex serico artificiose pontexunt. (p. 80.)\n\nCitrus medica, var. chirocarpa. Loar. sin: \u83e9\u63d0\u624b\u4f5b\u624b (Buddha's hand).\n11. Urbs Kian cheu in insula Hai nan. Crescunt hic ubique Nuc\u00e6 Indic\u00e6 majores ac minores, fructusque illo vulgo habitus totius orbis maximus, quem Jaco in India vocare solentem, qui ob eximiam magnitudinem non in ramis arborum, quamvis illi quoque ingentes sint, sed ipsi trunco adnascitur, quasi ex metu, ne tantum onus rami ferre detrectent quantumvis firmi aut robusti fuerint. Fructu cortex adeo dura crassusque est, ut securi aperiendus sit. Innumer\u00e6 intus domuncul\u00e6 seu folliculi sunt, in quibus pulpa est flav\u00e6 coloris, quae nucem veluti castan\u00e6am ambit; illa ubi maternit suavisima est; haec igne tostas castan\u00e6as nostrates refert. (p. 140)\n\n1. Cocos nucifera L.\u20142. Areca catechu L.\u20143. Artocarpus integrifolius L.\n\n12. Prov. Quang tung. Fructus quoque hic ubique plurimi sunt et praestantissimi, Europ\u00e6i non pauci: Poma granata. Uvae, Pyra, Nuc\u00e6, Custan\u00e6\u00e6, at hisce terris propri\u00e6 singulares: Mus\u00e6, Nuc\u00e6 indic\u00e6, Ananas, Lichia, Lung yen, Poma aurea etc. (p. 131.)\n\n13. Urbs Gu cheu (Martini means Wu chou fu in Kuang si.) Nascitur arbor Quang lang vocata, haec pro medulla mollem pulpam obtinet farinae simillimam, quin et farinae usum praestat, saporiisque non ingrat\u00e6 est, ad quaev\u00e6 esculenta adhibetur. (p. 145.)\n\nSin: \u5149\u7cd6 lang. Caryota.\n\n14. Urbs Kia hing (prov. Che kiang). Nascitur per totam hanc regionem in stagnantibus aquis fructus figura rotund\u00e6, Peci Sinae vocant, cujus magnitudo castan\u00e6am nucem haud multum excedit, pellis subtilissima pulli coloris nucleum vestit, cujus intus candidissima caro est plena succi, gratique saporis, durior est quam pomorum vulgarium, ac parumper acida. Si simul cum hoc fructu cupre\u00e6 monet\u00e6m ori immisit\u00e6s, dentibus eadem facilitate que fructum comminuit\u00e6s, ac in pulpam conestibilem rediges, mira nature vi, mihique alias ipse experimento sapro comperta. (p. 118.)\n\nThis is Eleocharis tuberosa. Schult. sin: \u8377\u85d5 pi tei cultivated throughout China.\n\n15. Urbs Xun te (Shun te fu, prov. Chili). Talo lacus magnus fructu aquatice Lin kio dicto celebris. Hic fructus tribuli fere habet figuram, ad instar triangularis pyramidis undequaque prominens, cortice viridi crassiorique est, ad apices rubescente, dum siccatur nigrescit, interior subatantis albisima est, sapore castan\u00e6\u00e6 nucis, magnitudine tres quatuorve castan\u00e6\u00e6 aequat. In stagnantibus aquis per totam Sinam scriitur. Planta foliis est exhibitus longissimo tructu per aqu\u00e6\nsumman superficiem proserpentibus, fractus multiplices sub aquis latitant. (p. 34.)\n\nTrapa bispinosa, Roxb., extensively cultivated in the lakes and rivers of Northern China. Sin: \u85cd\u82b1\u83f1\u79d1.\u2014The marsh of Ta le \u5927\u9678\u6fa4 is situated in the southern part of Chili.\n\n16. Prov. Kiang si. On p. 87 Martini gives a detailed description of the Lion, a waterplant found in all parts of China. The roots and the seeds of it are eaten. This is Eleocharis erythropoda. W. sin: \u9054\u6839.\n\n17. Prov. Quang tung. Non tamen hic praetererunda Rosa sinica est, illa nimium, quae diebus singulis bis colorem mutat, purpureaque modo tota, modo rursus omnino alba evadit. Caret suavitate odoris, in arbore nascitur. (p. 132.)\n\nRibes sanguineum, L.\n\n18. Urbs Langan (Yen an fu in Shenai). Florem profert Montan dictum maximeque estimatum a Sinis, quasi florum regem diceret, rosa nostrate major est, hujus tamen figuram imitatur, sed folia magis expandit, odore quidem cedit, at pulchritudine superat, spinis caret, coloris est magis albiceatis quasi ex purpureo et albo misti. Rubri etiam et flavi reperiuntur. In virgulto nascitur Sambuco nostrati hand absimili. Per totam Sinam hic floe in divitum viridariis colitur, idque magna arte et diligentia in calidioribus quippe locis aestate contra solis ardores regi debet. (p. 51.)\n\nAccording to Chinese authors the \u84dd\u82b1\u83f1\u79d1, or Trapa bispinosa, is found in a wild state in the mountains of the southwestern part of Shenai. Martini is the first European who notices this handsome Chinese flower introduced into European gardens only in 1789.\n\n19. Urbs Kin hoa (prov. Che kiang.). Nascitur hic floe ille quem in India Lusitanii Mogoros vocant. (Latinum illius nomen nusquam repertum.) In parva nascitur arbuscula, floe albisimius Gensemino non absimilis nisi quod plura habet folia. Odorem exhalat suavissimum Gensemino multo nobiliorem. Est apud Sinas in magna aestimatione. (p. 114.)\n\nThis is Jasminum Sambac. Alt., the \u8309\u8389\u82b1 so it has of the Chinese.\n\n20. Urbs Quei lin (prov. Quang si). Maxima ex parte nomen habet e Quei floribus, qui licet per totam reperiantur regionem Sinarum, nullibi tamen copiosiores sunt quam in hac provincia, maximeque in hujus urbis territorio unde urbi Quei lin nomen inditum, quod Quei florum sylvam sonat. Nascitur autem Quei floe in proceris arbore, quae folia habet lauri, aut Cinnamomi. Floe minimus est, ac flavi coloris, in racemulos dispersit, suavissimi plane odoris; floe apertus in ipse\narbore longo admodum tempore perstat integer, minimeque floccescit, ubi decidit, interjecto mensis unius spatio denuo arbor repullulat, novumque florem gignit autumnali tempore; tam fragrantem gratumque exhalat odorem, ut regionem totam cui arbor vicina est, a suavitate recreet atque perfundat. Latinum illius nomen nusquam reperio: is ipse autem flos est, quem Turcae limonum succo maceratum ad crines equorum tangendos adhibent. Ex eodem Sinae multa bellaria ori ac naribus gratissima adornant. (p. 143.)\n\nThe tree here described is the \u6842\u82b1 huai huai of the Chinese, the Cinnamomum Tsh. of botanists. M. is wrong in supposing it to be the \u8377\u82b1 of the Mohammedans, which is Laurusia alba Lam., also cultivated in Southern China.\n\n21. Urbe Cin chou (prov. Quang si). Cinnamomum profert praestantissimum, a Ceilani cinnamomo in eo tantum differt quod odoris sit fragrantioris, majorisque mordacitatis, dum linguae imponitur. (p. 146.)\n\nCinnamomum Cassia Bl., C Burmanii Bl. and perhaps other species furnish the Cassia bark of China.\u2014By Cin chou M. means \u6c5f\u5dde\u5e9c Sia chou fu. In the same prefecture near the town of Tai wu, according to Mr. Moss (Narrative of an exploration of the West river. 1870.) the best Cassia bark is produced.\n\n22.- Provincia Iun nan (Yun nan). Mo pang munimentum maxime australem ac occidentalem hujus provinciae partem occupat. Piper profert. (p. 165.)\n\n23. Provincia Kiang nan. Oha folium (p. 106). A good description of the Tea plant, its cultivation, preparation of the leaves etc. The best quality is said to be that of Sung lo.\u2014On p. 138 M. notices the tea of the prefecture of Ta li in Y\u00fcn nan.\n\nI have omitted Martini's treatise on tea (\u8336 cha in Chinese) for the subject is too well known and M. not the first European who mentions tea. The \u6885\u5c71 sung lo mountains separating the provinces of Che kiang and An hui, are still famed for their superior quality of tea.\n\n24. The province of Kiang nan (Kiang su and An hui) famed for its Cotton and manufacture of cotton cloths, especially the cities of Sung kiang and Shanghai. (p. 94, 101. I omit the details.)\n\n25. Urbe Nan kang (prov. Kiang si). Producit haec urbs Cannabim ex qua vestes aestivas contra calorem ac sudorem aptissimas texunt. (p. 88.)\u2014Urbe Xiao (Shao) wu (prov. Fo kien). Texit hujus urbis plebs pannos praestantissimos ex crudo Cannabe, qui aestati tempore ob frigiditatem et quia sudore\nmedefacti non sordescent, citoque siccanatur, vulgo expetantur et in pretio sunt. (p. 128.)\n\nBoccharia nivea. Hook. et Arn., from the fibre of which the so called Chinese Grasscloth is manufactured.\n\n26. Urbs Li ping (prov. Quan chen). Pannos conficiunt incolae ex cruda Cannabi, seu herba Cannabi prorsus simili. Co Sinas vocant. Ex his vestes pro tempore aestivo eximiae plane sunt, commodissimae. (p. 152.)\n\nPoastrum Thunbergianum Benth. (Poohyrisma Thunbergianum S et Z.) Sin.: \u8349\u5e03. F. trilobus D.C. has the same Chinese name. It seems that both of them are textile plants.\n\n27. Urbs Ping lo. (prov. Quang si) Conficitur hic pannus ex foliis Musarum rubrarum. (p. 145.)\n\nIn the Yi t'ung chi, the great geography of the Ch. Empire, the \u7d05\u7d2b\u5e03 hong tsieh pu (cloth made from the red Musa,) is mentioned as manufactured in the prefecture of Ping lo. Perhaps the Musa coecina, Andr., introduced into European gardens from China in 1792, is meant. I am not aware whether the appellation of red Musa could be applied to Musa textile Nees.\n\n28. Urbs Cin chen (prov. Quang si). Incolae ex herba Yu conficiunt pannos, quorum praestantia sericum ipsum superat, majorique quam istud in pretium sunt. (p. 146.)\n\nThe plant Yu and the fabric manufactured from its fibres seem to be unknown to Europeans. In the Yi t'ung chi I find under Sin chou fu (vide supra 21) a cloth mentioned there produced which they call \u6597\u5e03 chu pu or \u6597\u5e03 yu lin pu.\n\n29. Provincia Xan tung (Shan tung). Rarum est, et omnino nimium quantum benefacit in eam gentem naturae argumentum, filum sericum ibidem in arboribus ac campis sponte sus nasci, quod non a domesticis bombycibus, sed a vermis contextur eracis haud absimilibus, non in globum aut ovum ductum, sed in linguisimum filum paulatim ex ore emissum, albi coloris, quae arbustulis dumique adhaerentia, atque a vento huo illoque agitata colligantur, atque ex illis, uti ex vera byso, panni conficiuntur serici qui licet radiiores nonnihil sint serico domestico, firmitate tamen ac robore superant. (p. 53.)\n\nMartini alludes here to the wild silkworms feeding on the leaves of different oaks and producing the silk from which the so called Shan tung Pongee is woven (\u862d\u7d79 hien chou in Chinese.) Comp. Dr. Hanse's interesting article on Northern Chinese silk worm oaks, Journ. Linn. Soc. X. XIII. and Du Halde, la Chine II 307.\n\n30. Martini explains (p. 39) the method adopted by the Chinese in the production of Weeping Willows by bending down large branches of the liu or Willow tree, which generally has upright branches, and causing them to take root in the ground.\nI may observe, that *Salix babylonica* L., in Europe and Western Asia is generally seen with its branches hanging down, whilst in China (in Northern China at least) where this tree, \u6851\u6728 *liu she* in Chinese, is very common, its branches shoot originally upwards. In a similar way the Chinese produce artificially the tree known in Europe as *S. pendula*, in causing two young trees of *S. japonica* L., growing close together, to join by grafting, and then turning upwards the roots of one of them.\n\n31. Urbs Chao king (prov. Quang tung). *Multa odorifera ligna producit*: *Aquilon* nimirum et illud quod *Lusitani Pae de Rosa seu rosaceum* vocant, quo ad capsules, venas, sedes, similiique conficienda frequentissime utuntur, quoque vix aliud est praestantius, coloris ex nigro rubicantis, venis quibusdam intercismum et artificiosum benigne obstetricantis naturae quasi manu depictum.* (p. 137.)\n\nUrbs Kinn chen in insula Hai nan. *Aquila lignum crescit in montibus, uti et Ebenum, lignum Rosae;* et illud quod *Brasilium vulgo* vocant, quo ad tincturam per totam Sinam passim adhident fullones. (p. 140.)\n\nWith respect to Baglowood and Rose wood compare *Semedo* 8, note. The Ebony of China is probably yielded by the tree described in Loureiro's *Fl. cochin.* under the name of *Ebanoxylo verum,* but it seems that after Loureiro no botanist has had opportunity of observing it.\u2014Brazil wood is *Caesalpinia Seppana* L. (Comp. Yale's *M. Polo* 2d edition II 960.)\n\n32. Urbs Cin chen (prov. Quang si). *Ibidem arbor illa ferri est, buxo nostrato multo durior.* (p. 146)\u2014Urbs Chao king (prov. Quang tung). *Oao leang* mons prope *Te king* ex eo celebri, quod ingentes arbores, quae ferreae seu lignum ferreum vocant profert.\n\nThe mountain \u9ad8\u6881 *bao liang* in the district Te king shou. The tree producing the Chinese Iron wood, sin: \u9ad8\u6881\u6728 *tse li mu* seems to be unknown to botanists. Comp. Loureiro *Fl. cochin.* 326. *Barystium rufum.* There are probably several trees going under the same Chinese name. I have myself seen in Canton a red and a grayish green wood, both of them termed *tse li mu* and extremely hard.\n\n33. Urbs Chu chou (prov. Che kiang). *Luyen (?) rivus prope King ning (\u666f\u5be7) magnis *Arundinarum* sylvis virecentis. Sinenses communi nomine *Chu* dicunt, licet quam plurimae earum sunt species, *Lusitani in India Bambus* vocant, aliae aliis majoris sunt. Hanc omnium duritias prope ferrea est, adeoque saepes crassae sunt, ut duabus tribusve maribus stringere nequas: quamvis autem intus vacuae sint, suisque nodis articulisque distinctae, firmissimas tamen sunt, ac securissime imposita onera sustinent. Altitude saepes trium aut plarum cannum est, minores aliae mediam percacem haud excedunt, aliae sunt trunco ac ligno viridi, aliae nigerrimo, atque hae plerumque-\nsolidae quales in India Bambu marem vocant. Amoenissimum adspectum praebent tum folia oblonga forma gladioli, summitatibus nonnihil inflexis atque incurvis: tum quia tota anni tempore virides sunt. Licet autem adeo durae sint arundines facile tamen in licia tenuissima, ac veluti membranulas ab artis peritis dissecantur, ex quibus storeas, capsulas, pyxides, pectines aliaque simili utensilia minutissima subtilissime contextunt. Ex eisdem domos suas facile construant eisque par aediam minorum postibus utantur; ex tenuioribus hastilia fiant cuspide praeferrata atque ad sexcentos alios usus, quorum nimis prolixa esset narratio adhibentur. Ad aquarum canales ductusve struendos, cum a natura perforatae sint, aptissimae sunt: ac pro tubis opticis longioribus ob levitatem, rectitudinem, crassitatem ac firmitatem excellentes prorsus ac singulares. Cum recens haec canna absenta comburitar, aquam emittit, ut ligna omnia, plurimum a medicis expetitam: epota namque putrescentem sanguinem locoque motum vel casu, vel percussione, e corpore expellit. Tenere ac primum nata, pruisquam folia emittat cum carne adhibetur pro cibo veluti rapae, aut cocti cardui, quin et aceto macerata toto anno servatur tamquam condimentum, seu obsonium ad delicias, non secus ac minores apud nos cucumeres, aut foeniculum.

(p. 136.)\n\n\u2020\u2020 chen is the general term for Bamboo in Chinese. Munro in Transact. of Linn. Soc XXVI (1868) enumerates 12 species of Bambusa, known from China. It is not certain whether B. arundinacea Retz (Arundo Bambus L.) occurs in China.\n\n34. Urba Lui chen (prov. Quang tung). In omnibus hisce terris vimen illud mirabile nascitur quod Sinse Teng, Lusitani Beta vocant, funem a natura contortum esse credas, in maximam enim longitudinem extenditur, ac veluti funis per terram ac montes prorepit; spinis horridum est, foliisque oblongioribus viret, crassitie vix digitum aequat, et tamen saepe ad integrum stadium diffunditur, tantaque per montes copia ut inter se intricatae stirpes etiam cervis iter impervium reddant. Len- tissimum prorsus vimen est, maximeque fractioni resistit,\nquamobrem ex eo rudentes, funesque pro navibus confieri solent; imo illud in licea vittulasque tenuissimas minutissime partiri solent, ex iaque corbes, crates, sedilia aliaque similia contextere, maxime vero subtilissimas ac molissimas illas storeas, in quibus Sinenses plerique ad ipseem Regem nudi, dum somnum capiunt, decumbere consueverunt, quae res mundissima est et aestate perfrigida, et Sinensibus, tametsi eas storeas vel nudis asservibus instratae sint, sat commodae videtur ob longam ita decumbendi assuetudinem.

C. viminalis W. and probably several other species, growing in India, the Archipelago and Cochinchina furnish the Rattans so commonly employed for different purposes. As to the species of Southern China they are very imperfectly known, but some of the above mentioned species may occur also in China. The Chinese character \u9ebb (ma) denotes not only Rattans, but is also applied to other climbing plants.\n\n35. Urbs Nien chen (M. means Yen chou fu, prov. Chekiang.)

Quod mihi hic saep\u00e8 admirationem movit pinguedo quaedam est ex arboribus nata, ex qua veluti ac sebo optim\u00e6 atque albae fluit candela, quae manus non inficiant etiam tangantur, nec foetorem exhalant dum extinguuntur. A Sinis Kieu yeu vocari solet. Arbor sat magna est, pyros nostrates et folia et forma refert, florem album emittit, ut cerasi, florem excipit bacca rotunda omnino, ceraso mole aequalis; tegit hanc subniger et tenuis cortex, alba intus caro est, quae, cum bacca matura est, disrupto cortico appareat. Haec baccas colligunt ac aqua calida excoquunt, tum caro liquefit, ut frigida iterum omnino ut sebum solit, spissatur.\nNucleus dein remanet, hunc oleo plenum, ut olivas nos, macerant et oleum non ad cibos, sed ad lucernas aptum exprimunt. Hyberno tempore folia, quasi cuprea essent, omnino rubescunt; amoenus mihi horum foliorum saepe visus est conspectus, cum quasi integrae sylvae rubrae apparent: demum folia decidunt, et quia pinguedine quadam praedita sunt, gratissimum ovibus ac vaccis cibum praestant, ex quorum excitatio egregie pinguescunt.

But it seems that the greater part of the\ndrug collected for sale grows wild in the mountains of Si ning fu and those\nsurrounding lake Kukonor. Comp. also above Semedo 10, note.\u2014There is\nin Kircher's Chins illustrata (French ed. 1667) p. 249 an engraving re-\npresenting the \"Rheubarbarum verum.\" Kircher states, that this drawing\nhas been made from a plant grown in the garden of Mr. Juste Nobeler in\nLeyden at the time when Father Martini, in June 1654 passed through\nthis city. He then had declared, that it was the true Rhubarb of China.\nBut at the time here spoken of Rh. rhaponticum L. was the only Rhubarb\nknown and cultivated in European gardens, and Kircher's drawing seems\nindeed to represent this species.\u2014Dapper in his Description of China 1670\n(see further on) gives a good drawing of a Rhubarb plant, which he terms\nRhabarbarum Wilsoniarum. I know nothing about this name, but the\nplant represented seems also to be Rh. rhaponticum.\u2014The Chinese name\nof Rhubarb is \u5927\u9ec3 (Tai huang).\n\n41. Prov. Su chuen. Vera Radix Sina in hac provincia sola\nreperitur, sylvestris ubique, Folin utramque Sinae vocant, ac\nfere sola sylvestris ad nos affertur, cujus medulla rubicandiori\ncolore quodammodo tincta est, ad versae autem magnitudinem\nnon accedit, neque efficaces adeo habet vires, quamvis non\nomnino illius effectu careat.

(p. 65.)\n\nMartini's Radix Sina vera is a fungus which has been described under the botan. name Paekyma Cocos Fries. (Hanbury scient. pap 201, 267) in Chinese \u83cc\u5b50 fu ling or \u767d\u83cc\u5b50 pe fu ling, i.e. white fu ling; whilst his Rad. Sina sylvestris is to be referred to Smilax China L. and other species yielding the drug we call China root and the Chinese \u571f\u832f\u82d3 fu fu ling i.e. common fu ling. Martini at first distinguishes the two plants but in the description confounds them.\n\n42. Urbe Hang chou (prov. Che kiang).

He left Europe as a Jesuit missionary for China in 1643, returned to Europe (Lisbon) in 1652, reembarked for China in 1656 and died in the province of Kuang si in 1659.\n\nThe original work of Boym's Flora sinensis published in Latin is a very rare book. I have seen it in the great Vienna library. It is issued in folio, Viennae Austriae, typis Matthaei Rictij, 75 pages with 23 engravings. Several prefaces, dedications and poetical essays occupy a considerable part of the book, which has no claim to research into Chinese botany, as the name of the treatise would seem to indicate. Boym gives an account of 22 plants, of which more than one half are rather plants of the Indian Archipelago. 21 of them are represented by tolerably well executed engravings and the Chinese characters added to the names. The Flora sinensis is followed by an account of some Chinese mammals, birds, reptiles etc with 2 engravings. The book concludes with an appendix on the Inscription of Si an fu. Boym's Flora sinensis has been translated into French by Bayer and appeared also in Thevenot's Relation des Voyages. 1696 sec. partie p. 15-30. The greater part of the engravings have been reproduced in Kircher's China illustrata and in Dapper's Description of China (see further on.)\n\nI shall give in the following pages a list of the plants described by Boym, reproducing occasionally the original text or a part of it.\n\n1. Yay cu \u6930\u5b50. Palma persica et indica seu sinensis, vulgo Coco vel Nux Indorum. (no engraving.)\n\n2. Pin lam \u6930\u6a39. Fructus Areca et Betel folium. (no engraving.)\n\nDrawings representing the Areca palm and Betel pepper are found in J. Bontius, Historia natur. et med. Indiae orient. (1628.) p. 90. 91.\n\n3. Fan yau \u53cd\u82bb\u6a39. Arbor Papaya in India dicitur, copioso in Sinarum Haynan insula progignitur nec non in Iunnam, Quamsy, Quamtam, Focien, australibus provinciis.\nThe first character in the Chinese name is evidently wrong. In the China Botany Chi wu ming shi t'a bao XXXI, fol. 64, Carica Papaya L. is represented in a drawing and termed \u9999\u74dc\u679c (xiang guo guo) (foreign melon tree). A drawing of it is also found in Bontius l. c. 96.\n\n4. Pa cyao \u9999\u8549\u679c. Ficus indica et sinica. Integro anno fructus iste reperitur in Indiis et apud Sinas in regnis australibus. In Brasilia fructus vocatur Banana.\n\n5. Kia gin (seu Ka gin) \u6842\u91d1\u679c. Fructus indicus, apud Sinas non reperitur, verum in regnis quae Sinaram olim fuerant abundanter provenit et crediderim allatam in Yunnan et Quamsi possesse produci. Arbor est magna foliis pulcherrimis et semper virentibus. Fructus imitatur pomum flavum vel rubicundum, ubi maturascit odoriferum, verum pomi suco agrestis est, et caro si comedatur guttur mordet. Fructus nullum semen habet, sed in vertice illius ad instar nuclei prominet, quem cortex glaucus, alba carne et solidam recondens, instar castaneae vel amygdalae nucis cooperit, saporem earundem si elixetur referens. Indi et Lusitani nucleis dictis loco amygdalarum utuntur.\n\nThe above description and the accompanying drawing of the fruit leave no doubt that Annona squamosa L. is meant. The Chinese characters render, it seems, the Indian name of it, being Caju (Watson names of Indian plants etc.). Comp. also Loureiro 804, Bontius l.c. 198.\n\n6. 7. Lici \u679c\u679d et Lam yun \u679c\u679c fructus. Nephellum Litsehi. Camb and M. Zangari. Camb. (V. supra Martini 7.)\n\n8. Gienbo \u6842\u6ce2. Fructus duplicem habet speciem, nam et rubri et albi coloris in India, subflavi rosarum fragrantium redolens odore in Malacca, Macao et Sinarum insula Hiam-nan reperitur. Prior species florem purpureum, posterior alboflavum habet. Folia pulcherrima laevia ac uno palmo longa triumque digitorum lata. Frutus ipse magnus plane sicut pommum, frigidissimae qualitatis.\n\nBoym describes two species of the Rose-Apple, Jambu in India, vis: Eugenia malaccensis L. (purple flowers) and E. Jambos L. (yellowish white flowers). The fruit is well represented by the drawing.\u2014The island Hiang shan is situated north of Macao. E. Jambos is naturalised in Hong-kong (Bth. fl. hong. 130.)\n\n9. Fan po lo mie \u82ac\u6ce2\u679c\u871c. Ananas fructus in australibus regnis Quamnum, Quamsi, Yunnan, Focien et insula Hainan provenit abunde. Ad Indias orientales ex Brasilia dicitur falsae apportatus.\n\nThe first Chinese character is again wrong and is to be read \u9999 (foreign).\n\n10. Macao (Chinese characters illegible). In australibus terris producitur uberrime.\nA good description and drawing of Mangifera indica. L. Compare also Bentham Lc. 26.\n\n11. Pi pa \u6787\u6777.\nMangifera indica Lindl.\n\n12. Cieu ko \u6787\u6777 seu Goyasa fructus. In provinciis australibus apud Sinas.\nThe Chinese characters mean: stinking fruit. Indeed the scent of the fruit of Faidia Goyasa L. when too ripe is unpleasantly powerful. According to Dr. Williams in Bridgm. Chrest. 448 (15) the Chinese name of the Goya is \u7d05\u679c\u5b50 Ki shi huo, meaning: fowls dung fruit. Under the latter name it is represented in the Chi wu ming etc. XXXI 49.\n\n13. Po lo mi \u69b4\u679c\u5ba2 seu Ginos ab Indis dictus fructus.\nArtocarpus integrifolia, L. Jack fruit. Compare above Martini ii. The Chinese name po lo mi, under which it is also represented in the Chi wu ming, XXXI 44, is apparently a transcription of the Sanscrit pamarita (excellence).\n\n14. \u6930\u5b50 Su pim. Fructus sinicus. Arbor et fructus apud Sinas tantum nascitur, est aurei et purpurei coloris magnus, pumum excedit, carmen mollem ac rubeam cum simili pallioeula refert, osicula hinc inde interius abscondit. Cum siccatur ficibus Europaeis simillimus est et per multos annos conservatur. In Quantum et Fokien regionibus Januario, Februario, sed in Xensi et Honan aliisque septentrionalibus Junio, Julio et Augusto maturescit.\n\nBoymyes Kaki, L. v. supra Semedo & The Chinese name given by Boym properly denotes the dried fruit, for the second character means cake.\n\n15. Ya ta su \u4e9e\u5927\u6a39. Fructus ya ta in Indiae et popotissimum agro Malacensi reperitur, qui Sinis olim tributam pendebat, ideoque sinicus fructus optime dici potest et quod etiam in sinense solum translatus uberrime germinet. Viridem corticem et piniferum habet, sed interius carnum liquidam nive ad instar albae, sapore superat dulciarium, quod Lusatiani appellant mangiar reale. In multis cellulis osicula nigra solida recludit. Alicubi Octobre et Novembre, alicubi Februario et Martio mensibus maturescit.\n\nThe drawing given by Boym of this fruit represents Anona squamosa L. By ya ta (a ta in the Southern dialect) the Singhalese name of it, being atta (Watson Lc.), is rendered. At Canton the Chinese call it fan li chi, foreign Li chi (Bridg. Lc. 448 (10).\n\n16. Du li am \u571f\u5229? Fructus hic in Java, Malaca, Macaca (vulgo Celebe.) et Siam regnis ac insulis olim tributariis Sinaram reperitur. Caro illius alba. Sicca caro fructus instar lactis coagulati in alias partes deportatur venalis, quae nucleum interius ad modum albaminis ovi cooperit.\n\nThis is the famed Durian, Durio Zibethinus. L. a tree of the Indian Archipelago and Siam. I do not think that it is cultivated in Macao as Grosier (in China II. 558.) reports. It seems to me that Grosier, who\nrefers to Boym; took Macaca mentioned by the latter to be Macao. But Macacae is an ancient name for Macassar (Crawfurd Dict. Ind. isl. 90.). Bontius l. c. 118 seems to confound the Durian with the Jack fruit, at least he gives Durian and Joca as synonyma. His drawing of the fruit could be referred to the Jack as well as to the Durian, it does not represent leaves.\n\n17. *Innominate Fructus.* Illius nominis sinici non memini. Vidi illum primum in insula Hainan et postea in provincia Quamtam. Arbor procer, folia maxima, quae medium hominem contegere possant, producit. Hoc admirabile habet, quod media radice telluri inheret, ex alia autem parte radicis patente flores rubros et simul fructus, similes Europaeis ficibus progenerat, qui cum maturescunt, rubent paululum; sed interior caro et sapor illorum figuram et saporem ficum repraesentat. Julio et Augusto maturescunt.\n\nIt would seem from this description and the drawing accompanying it, that *Gynostemma caudiforme* L. is meant, a tree of the Malayan Archipelago, which I have seen myself in Java. The fruits of it grow on the stem or about the roots.\n\n18. *Hu cyao* \u80e1\u6912 *Piper nigrum*, L. (v. supra Martini 22.)\n19. *Fo lim* \u832f\u82d3 *Radix Siniae* (v. supra Martini 41.)\n20. *Tay hoam* \u592a\u9ec4 *Rhabarbarum* (v. s. Martini 40.)\n21. *Qusi pi* \u6842\u76ae *Cinnamomum* (v. s. Martini 21.)\n22. *Sem kiam* \u751f\u59dc *Zingiber.*\n\nA good drawing of Chinese Ginger is found also in Bontius l.c. 139.\n\nAs the late D. Hanbury has proved in the introduction to his Notes on Chin. Materia medica, the treatise, which is generally quoted under the name of CLEYER'S SPECIMEN MEDICINAE SINICAE, published in 1682, consists of translations from Chinese medical works by Father Boym. They were only edited by Andreas Cleyer, a physician in the service of the Dutch E.I. Comp., well known as the first European botanist, who studied the Flora of Japan. One section of the specimen medicinae sin. of 30 pages, is entitled: *Medicamenta simplicia quae a Chinensibus ad usum medicum adhibentur.* It is nothing more than an enumeration of 289 Chinese drugs, for the most part of vegetable origin, giving the Chinese name of each written according to the Portuguese orthography, without the Chinese characters. The medical properties of each drug according to the Chinese ideas, are explained. In some cases the author adds the European name. Although the greatest part of these drugs can now be ascertained from the Chinese names added, the treatise is altogether devoid of interest and may be quoted only as a bibliographical curiosity.\nIn the same year, 1655, when Martini's Novus Atlas Sinensis was published in Europe, the Dutch E. I. Company sent an embassy to Peking and appointed Goyen and Keyser, two merchants of Batavia, as envoys. J. NIEUHOF, who accompanied them as steward of the mission, published ten years later a work under the title: LEGATIO BATAVICA AD MAGNUM TARTARIAN CHAMUM SUNG TRIUM,* SINAE IMPERATOREM. Amst. 1665. It is illustrated by a great number of engravings representing views, plants, animals and other things relating to China, and has been translated into several European languages. This book may well stand as a model of the most impudent plagiarism and imposture in the literature of travels in the 17th century. As N. quotes no previous books on China, the reader cannot but suppose that all the rich information he furnishes with respect to that Empire, had been gathered by himself in China. But in reality it is only the diary of the embassy's journey from Canton to Peking, partly by land and partly by river and the Grand Canal, which N. can claim as his property, and there is nothing in it to boast of, for the whole narrative abounds in errors and intentional misrepresentations. As far as I can judge the drawings in this work, representing Chinese scenery, are all pure creations of fancy. The cities and villages of North China, through which they passed, appear there as overshadowed by lofty Cocoanut trees, and even Peking, of which a large view is given, with the great wall close behind the city, has not been exempted by the artist in this respect. As to the rest of the accounts found in this work, they are a reproduction of Martini's valuable Atlas sinensis, and that is precisely the case regarding the chapter dealing with Chinese plants, animals, etc. The engravings representing plants have been borrowed from Bontius and Boym. Some of them seem to be the production of the artist's imagination.\n\nIn 1670 Dr. DAPPEL, published in Dutch a DESCRIPTION OF THE CHINESE EMPIRE, appended to his narratives of the second and the third Dutch embassy to the Chinese Court, in 1662 and 1666-1668. This is also nothing more than a translation of the Atlas sinensis, often misunderstood, undigested and indigestible. Nearly twenty pages in it are devoted to the Botany of China. The greater part of the drawings of Boym's Flora sinensis are here reproduced and, of course, no sources are adduced.\n\n* Emperor Shun chi 1644-62.\nThere is another well known ancient work on China, KIRCHER'S CHINA ILLUSTRATA, published in 1667. This has also little claim to originality. The author, who had never been in China, draws from Martini (who had been his pupil,) Boym, and the writings of other missionaries, but he quotes honestly his sources and compiles with criticism, displaying a great knowledge of the subject he treats of. Athanasius Kircher, a German, born in 1601-1680, was also a Jesuit, at first Professor at W\u00fcrzburg; he subsequently resided in Avignon and in Rome.\n\nAfter Boym the next Jesuit missionary in China I have to notice as a writer on matters of natural science is GABRIEL DE MAGALHAES, a Portuguese. He was born in 1609, arrived in China in 1640, died at Peking in 1677. He is the author of a work entitled: NOUVELLE RELATION DE LA CHINE. The original M.S. was in Portuguese. It was translated into French and published in 1668. On p. 173 we find an interesting account of the Chinese White Wax, pe la (\u767d\u8721), produced by insects in the provinces of Shan tung and Hu kuang, and of the trees on which these insects use to live. Compare above Martini 37.\n\nSome remarks on Chinese plants are found also in LE COMTE'S NOUVEAUX MEMOIRES SUR L'ETAT DE LA CHINE. Paris 1696. 2 vol.\n\nLouis Le Comte, a Frenchman, born in 1655, joined the Jesuit mission in China in 1687. He died in Bordeaux, in 1729.\n\n1. We learn from Le Comte (I. 173.) that the first Orange tree, which had been introduced by the Portuguese from China, then (i.e. at the end of the 17th cent.) still existed in the garden of Count St. Laurent in Lisbon.\n\nIt is known, that the sweet Orange, now extensively cultivated in Southern Europe, was unknown there before the middle of the 16th cent., when it was introduced by Juan de Castro. It is in allusion to its Chinese origin, that the orange in Dutch is styled Sinaas appel, and Apfelzine in German.\n\n2. Le Comte saw in the province of Shensi a kind of small yellow Melon, which the Chinese eat, without peeling off the skin. He notices also Melons the same in size as those cultivated in Europe and large Watermelons with red or white pulp (I. 132.)\n\nAn excellent globular Melon of the size of a small fist with a thin skin is also seen in Peking and known there under the name of \u9ebb\u74dc. \u74dc is the general term for Melon, and \u9ebb\u74dc is a variety. The peel is yellow, or in another variety green. Loureiro, Fl. cochin. 736, speaks of Melons of large size in Southern China. I have not seen large Melons in Peking.\n3. A good description of the Tea plant, its culture, etc., in the Province of Fukien is found I. 368. The author explains that the Chinese call the plant properly Oa, and that only in the dialect of Fukien the name sounds Ts.\n\n4. Le Comte reports that Tobacco is cultivated near Peking and in the provinces of Shansi, Shensi, Szechuan. (I. 168.)\n\nLe Comte seems to be the first European who notices Tobacco in China. It is now a well-established fact, that Tobacco was first introduced into China through the seaports of Fukien at the end of the 16th or the beginning of the 17th cent.\n\n5. Le Comte speaks (I. 178) of a peculiar Chinese Onion in the following terms: J'y ai vu une esp\u00e8ce d'oignon qui ne vient point de graine comme ceux d'Europe, mais \u00e0 la fin de la saison on voit sortir de petites filaments sur la pointe ou sur la tige des feuilles, au milieu desquelles se forme un oignon blanc semblable \u00e0 celui qui germe dans la terre. Ce petit oignon pousse avec le temps des feuilles comme celles qui le soutiennent, lesquelles \u00e0 leur tour portent un troisi\u00e8me oignon sur leur pointe, de mani\u00e8re n\u00e9anmoins que leur grosseur et leur hauteur diminuent \u00e0 mesure qu'ils s'\u00e9loignent de la terre.\n\nThis seems to be the same onion as that described under the name of \u6d0b\u8525 lon ts'eng (onion growing in stories) in the \u85e5\u8349\u672c\u8349 hie hang pen ts'e, published at the end of the 14th cent; a good drawing of it is also given there. The description states that at the top of the leaves grow from 4 to 5 little onions and on these again other onions are produced constituting thus from 8 to 4 stories. These onion plants do not bear seeds.\u2014We have here probably to do with a so-called viviparous variety of an Onion. Allium Cepa, A. scorodoprasum and other species show sometimes the peculiarity of their flowerstems being surmounted by small bulbs, instead of bearing flowers and seeds. These bulbs produce new plants.\n\n6. The black and yellow Peas, to which Le C. refers (I. 168) as used in North China for feeding horses, are: the yellow, Soja hispida Moench. (Glycine Soja), the black, a variety of it.\n\n7. Le C. speaking of the Poi (Hleocharis tuberosa. Schult. v. supra Martini 14.) refers to Martini's statement, that when chewed together with a copper coin, the latter is easily bruised by the teeth, a story we met also in Chinese books. But Le C. refutes this assertion, appealing to his own experience. (I. 179.)\n\n8. The tree is described which yields the Chinese Pepper or ke ts'ien. (I. 177.)\n\nSeveral species of Zanthoxylon are included under the name of \u82b1\u6912 ke ts'ien in China. In Peking this name is applied to S. Bungei. Pinch.\n9. Description of the tree ox tom chu, a large tree of the appearance of the Sycamore. It has large leaves with long leafstalks, the seeds of it are produced on the edges of leaves, different however in shape from the true leaves. (I. 268). There is also a good drawing of this tree.\n\nThis is Sterculia plataniifolia. Cav. a common tree in China, sin: \u6995\u6811\u6995\u6811 wu fang shu. Its carpel opens into green follicles indeed much resembling leaves, with the seeds attached to the edges of the follicles.\n\n10. Le C. states that besides Cotton, the Chinese use to wear in summer clothes made from Nettles and another kind, they call Co pow, which is much esteemed by them. The latter is obtained in Fokien from a plant called Co, a shrub-like creeper, which they allow to grow over the fields, often extremely long. It has roundish leaves larger than those of the Ivy. They are soft, green on the upper side but covered on the under side with a coating of white down. The stem attains the thickness of a finger. To obtain the textile fibres they soak the stems in water, as we do in preparing flax, and after having removed the outer skin, they use the fibres of the inner bark for making linen, which is very fine, transparent and cool. (I. 242.)\n\nPusaria Thunbergiana. Benth. already noticed by Martini (v. supra M. 26). \u85dc in Chinese.\n\n11. Le C. devotes also some pages to the celebrated Ginseng, describing the plant and the mode of its use as a medicine (I. 377).\n\nA great amount of useful information with respect to China is stored up in the LETTRES \u00c9DIFIANTES ET CURIEUSES \u00c9CRITES DES MISSIONS \u00c9TRANG\u00c8RES, a collection of letters written by the ancient Jesuit missionaries to their superiors or friends in Europe. There are several editions of this collection. The most convenient for reference is that published in the Panth\u00e9on litt\u00e9raire, of which the letters received from the Chinese and Indo-Chinese Missions constitute vol. III and IV.\n\nThe following names of Jesuit missionaries appear there in connection with reports on botanical matters in China.\n\nJOANNES LAURRATTI, an Italian, born 1666, joined the Chinese mission 1697, died 1727 at sea.\n\nHe wrote a letter, dated Fokien, July 26, 1714, to the Baron of Zee, in which he gives some accounts of the vegetable productions of China, especially of Tea. (Panth. lit. III. 225.)\n\nIn the same letter he notices, that the Chinese use the fibres of a Nettle for making clothes and speaks also of Tobacco which in the beginning of the 18th cent. was largely cultivated in Fokien. (I.c. 228.)\nFRANCIS XAVIER D'ENTRECOLLES, a Frenchman, born 1662, joined the Chinese mission 1698, + in Peking 1741. Many interesting notes on China from his pen have been preserved. The following relate to Chinese plants:\n\nLetter to Father Du Halde, dated Peking 7 Jul. 1727 (l.c. III 544.) This letter contains an interesting treatise on the manufacture by the Chinese of artificial flowers made from the marrow of a Chinese plant, called tong tsao, of which the author gives a description translated from a Chinese work.\n\nThis is the \u9054 \u85e4 tong ts'ao of the Chinese, a plant which is not only used in making artificial flowers, but is also the source of the Rice paper, erroneously so called. It was only in 1852 that European botanists became acquainted with this plant, a native of Formosa. Sir W. Hooker described it in his Journ. of Bot., 1853 and 1858 as Aralia papyriformis. It has been introduced subsequently into many tropical countries. When I visited Java, in 1872, I saw it already, escaped from cultivation, growing luxuriantly in the forest surrounding the botanical garden of Tjibodas.\n\nIn the same letter (l.c. 547) d'Entr. says a few words on the large Citron, called Fo shou or Buddha's hand by the Chinese (v. supra Martini 10.)\n\nIn another letter, dated Peking 6 Oct. 1736 (l.c. III 718.) he treats of several other famed Chinese plants and begins first with some interesting and correct accounts of the tree and fruit, which the Chinese call si tse or chi tse. (Diospyros Kaki) as has already been stated, v. supra Semedo 4, Boym 14.) He had observed the tree at Peking and sent also seeds of it to Paris. He states that the provinces of Shan tung, Ho-nan and Che-kiang are famed for their excellent sitze fruits, which are of various sizes, colors and shapes in different parts of China. They are generally of an orange or red color, but those of Chekiang are green even when ripe. Some varieties of this fruit have the appearance of two apples joined together or a fruit of two stories. The fruits on grafted trees are devoid of seeds.\n\nThe author here refers to the Peking variety of the Kaki, the largest in size, which near the basis of the fruit is provided with a circular depression and contains rarely seeds.\n\nE. further states that the Chinese claim to graft successfully peachtrees on the sitze.\n\nI have found the same statement in ancient Chinese works but cannot confirm it.\n\nAfter this E. speaks of the Lichi fruits (v. supra Martini 7.) and then proceeds to describe a kind of Acacia, called hoai shu by the Chinese. Its fruit is used as medicine, the flowers for dying yellow.\nThis is the *Sophora japonica*, L., a very common tree all over China, sin: \u69d0\u6a39 huai shu.\n\nE. next translates from a Chinese book some notes with respect to *Willows*, explaining the use of willow wool instead of cotton.\n\nThe author means *Salix babylonica*, L., also a very common tree in China. This reminds me of a statement of Professor Bunge, who, in his Enum. plant. Chinas bor., writes that the female tree of S. babylonica is very rare at Peking. This is an error. The female tree is met here much more frequently than the male and in May or June, when the willow seeds ripen, the air in the neighborhood of some places, where the trees abound, is full of this white wool (cottony down, which envelopes the seeds.) and d'Entrecolles reports the same. If I am not mistaken, in Europe the female tree only of S. babylonica is known. At Peking both male and female are met with.\n\nIn the same letter (l.c. 721) E. recommends, on the authority of Chinese authors, the roots of the *Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re*, sao tcheou ts'au, termed kiue in Chinese books, as substitute for food in times of famine.\n\nThe author commits an error. What the French call Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re is *Kochia scoparia*, Schrad., a salsolaceous plant in North China as common as in Europe. The Pen tsao kang mu, XVI. 44. calls it \u5730\u8525\u5b50 ti fu ts' or \u64ad\u5e63\u8349 sao chou ts'au (meaning broom plant.) But the \u85e4\u8568 (Pen tsao XXVII. 25.) is not the same, this name being applied to a Fern, *Pteris aquilina*, L., the farinaceous rhizons of which are used in China as food as is also the case in some parts of Europe.\n\nFinally (l.c. 722) E. gives an account of the Chinese Camphor tree and the method used by the Chinese to obtain Camphor from it.\n\n**DOMINICUS PARENNIN**, a Frenchman, born 1665, came to China 1698, + in Peking, 1741.\n\nIn 1723 Parennin sent a few Chinese drugs to the Academy of Sciences in Paris, furnishing some explanatory remarks on them in an accompanying letter. (l.c. III 341.)\n\nThe first of these drugs he calls hia tsao tum chom, meaning as he explains: a plant in summer, and in winter an insect. It is produced in Tibet and also in the province of Sz' ch'uan, and considered among the Chinese a very powerful medicine. The Father had himself experienced the medical virtues of this drug.\n\nIt is known now, that the drug in question is a Fungus, *Cordyceps sinensis*, which grows upon the head of a caterpillar.\n\nThe plant next described, the san tsi, is said to grow in the mountains of the provinces of Y\u00fcn nan, Kui chou and Sz' ch'uan. This is still unknown to botanists. The plant \u4e09\u4e03 san ts'i is treated of in the Pen ts'ao XII b. 41. The name\nmeans; three and seven, and is explained by the distribution of the leaves.\n\nAfter this P. gives some account of Rhubarb, and concludes by noticing an aromatic root, called tam coue, brought from Sz'ch'un and much valued by the Chinese.\n\nThis is, it seems, the tang kui of the Pen ts'ao, XIV. a 1. which is referred by Tatarinov with P. to Radix Levisticii chinensis. I do not find this name in D.C. Prodor. It seems, that the Chinese plant yielding the drug tang kui is unknown to botanists.\n\nIn the same letter (l.c. III 345.) P. states, that during 18 years he had accompanied the Emperor Kanghi on all his frequent travels. As is known, Kanghi was an enthusiastic sportsman. His hunting expeditions were generally directed to Southern Mongolia and Manchuria. There were also other missionaries, who were associated with Parennin in these excursions. He mentions especially Dr. Bourghese and Baudin. The latter, a clever apothecary and botanist, had been ordered by Kanghi to search in the mountains for Gentian and Imperatoria (Masterwort) in order to prepare the celebrated Theriaca Andromachi. But Baudin did not succeed in finding these plants.\n\nThere is no Masterwort in North China or in Southern Mongolia, but as to Gentiana, there are 5 species of it growing in the Peking mountains, some of them even employed as medicine by the Chinese. The Chinese name for Gentiana is lung tan tn'ao (dragon's gall plant.)\n\nP. gives finally in the same letter a slight sketch of the botany of the mountains of Southern Mongolia. Among the trees and shrubs there he mentions Oaks of a dwarf size, Pines, the Aspen, Elm trees, Hazelnuts, wild Roses.\n\nThe Tartars and Mongols, who inhabit these regions, do not cultivate any fruit. There are also very few wild fruits. Two of them are worthy of notice.\n\nThe fruit oulana, as the Tartars call it, is of the size of a great red cherry and is produced on a little stem, 3 or 4 inches high. The other fruit has the appearance of small raisins. It is produced in clusters on a fine tree, 25 and more feet in height. After the first frost these berries become red and are then of an acidulated sweet taste.\n\nOolana is the Mongol and Manchurian name for Prunus humilis. Ege, frequent in the mountains of North-China and Southern Mongolia. As to the other fruit mentioned, it is difficult to say, what is meant, for P. gives no native name. Perhaps he saw Sorbus aucuparia. L.\n\nP. mentions further the following herbaceous plants he met with in these mountains; a fine Angelica, Dictamus albus,\nParsnip, Asparagus, Chelidonium, Potentilla, Agrimonium, Pimpernel (Poterium sanguisorba.), Pouliot (Mentha.), Jovarbe (Sedum.), Artemisia, Absinthium.\n\nI have adduced the preceding particulars merely on account of the length of time that has elapsed since their publication, for the botanical features of the regions Parennin traversed about 180 years ago, are well known now. We can therefore account for the plants he speaks of.\n\nFinally I may mention, that Parennin was the first European who notices the elegant Wisteria chinensis D.C., well known now also in our gardens. The climbing plant ten lo hua he speaks of (see Grosier: la Chine III. 66.) in a letter to Father Du Halde, with violet flowers hanging down in large bunches, is without doubt W. chinensis, sin: \u85e4\u7f85\u82b1 teng lo hua, growing wild and also much cultivated in North-China.\n\nPetrus Jartoux, a Frenchman, born 1668, joined the Chinese mission 1701, + in Peking 1720.\n\nWe owe to this missionary a very valuable article on the Ginseng plant (Panax Ginseng C.A. Mey.) contained in a letter addressed to the Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des Missions des Indes et de la Chine, and dated Peking, 12 April, 1711. (l.c. III. 183.)\n\nThe Fathers Jartoux and Regis had been intrusted by the Emperor Kanghi with the survey of Manchuria and the eastern part of the Great Wall, and on this occasion Jartoux had opportunity to visit the very country where the finest specimens of this famous plant grow, near the frontier of Corea. Jartoux describes the plant and the mode of its collection and preparation for the Emperor's use, and adds also a drawing of it made by himself from nature. Du Halde in his great work on China reproduces this drawing. Jartoux here gives the first authentic account of Chinese Ginseng. Lamarck in his Encyclop. Botan. II. 714 gives an abstract of this memoir.\n\nGaspard Chausenbaume, a Frenchman, born 1711, joined the Chinese mission 1746, + in the province of Kiangsi in 1761. He has left an interesting memoir, written about 1750, and published in the Panth. lit. III. 830, on Chinese Insectwax. Ch. who speaks from his own observation made in the province of Hu kuang, gives some very valuable information regarding the insects which produce the wax, as well as with respect to the trees upon which they use to live. (Comp. above Martini 37, Maghellaee.)\n\nFather J. B. Du Halde, in his admirable and comprehensive work: DESCRIPTION DE L'EMPIRE DE LA CHINE, published 1735 in French, and\ntranslated into many other languages, devotes several chapters to Chinese Botany, viz: I 16-27 Fruits, trees, flowers, economic plants; II. 64. On Chinese Agriculture and the Cereals of China; II. p. 143-153. On the abundance of several productions in China. Finally, there is in vol. III 378-509 a long treatise on Chinese medicine, all translations from Chinese medical works, especially from the *Pen ts'ao hang mu*, the well known Chinese book on Natural History and Materia medica. We find there several descriptions of Chinese medicinal plants. According to Le Comte (I 368.) these translations are due to Father Videlon, one of the most distinguished sinologues. (Born 1656 in France, joined the Chinese mission 1687, + in India 1737.)\n\nAs Du Halde has drawn all the information brought together in his work, from the letters of the Jesuit missionaries, we meet in it most of the matter preserved in the Lettres \u00e9difiantes. He never quotes his sources, but gives in the preface a list of the names of the missionaries, who have contributed to the compilation of the work. I need not mention that Du Halde had never visited China. He was himself a Jesuit and it seems that he made use of many letters, which the missionaries in China addressed to him and which are not included in the collection of the Lettres \u00e9difiantes.\n\nIn the sequel I give a list of the Chinese plants spoken of in Du Halde's work, supplying the botanical names as far as these plants are known to me. I quote from the original French edition.\n\nThe fruit *Tsetse* (I. 16.) is *Diospyros Kaki*. (v. Semedo 4, Boym 14.) Oranges, Citrons, Lemons (I. 16 and II. 143.)\n\n*Litchi* and *Long yen* (I. 16.) *Nephelium Litchi* and *N. Longan* (v. Martini 7.)\n\nPampelmoose, yeoutse (I. 16. 17). *Citrus decumana*. L. (v. Martini 9.)\n\nThe fruits *Tein lan* and *Quang lan*, resembling our olives (I. 16. 17.) are *Canarium Pinela*. Koen. sin: \u9752 \u6a44 \u6cb9 \u679c *tsing lan*, and *C. album*. R\u00e4nsh. sin: \u6aac \u679c *kan lan*.\n\nThe *hoa tsiao*, Chinese Pepper (I. 17.) is *Zanthoxylum* (v. supra Le Comte 8.) I do not know what is meant by \"arbre qui produit des pois\" (I. 17.) perhaps *Robinia* or *Caragana*.\n\nSome interesting particulars with respect to the Chinese Varnish tree, *Tsieh* (I. 17, II. 174.) Comp. also above Martini 35.\n\nIn the Phil. Trans. vol. XXII. p. 525. (1700) is an article: On the way of making China Varnishes sent by the Jesuits in China to the Grand Duke of Tuscany, communicated by\nDr. W. Sherard, the well known botanist, who is said to have gained this information whilst in Rome with his pupil, the Duke of Beaufort.\n\nThe tree tong chu, with fruit resembling walnuts and containing a poisonous oil, used for painting, (I. 18.) is the *Aleurites cordata* M\u00fcll. (*Elaeococca verrucosa* Adr. Juss., *Vernicia montana* Lour.) sin: \u6850\u6a39 t'ung shu.\n\nThe Tallow tree (I. 18, II. 143.) v. supra Martini 36.\n\nThe pe la chu or Wax-insect tree. (I. 18.) Martini 37. sin: \u767d\u881f\u6a39 pe la shu.\n\nThe tchou tse or Bamboo (I. 19.) sin: \u7af9\u5b50 ch'u tse'. Martini 33.\n\nThe cha mou, yielding an excellent timber wood (I. 19.) is the *Cunninghamia sinensis*. R. Br. sin: \u6c99\u6728 sha mu.\n\nThe nan mou, a precious timber wood, much used for building the Imperial palaces (I. 19.) is, as my friend, Father David, kindly informed me, a species of *Laurus*. He saw the tree in Ss'ch'uan.\n\nThe tse tan or Rose wood, the tse ly mou or Iron wood (I. 19.) \u6a80\u9999\u6728 tan' tan', a heavy precious wood, much used for furniture. The tree which produces it seems to be unknown to botanists. With respect to Iron wood comp. above Martini 32.\n\nThe Tea plant (I. 20.)\n\nThe tree tcha yeou, the fruit of which yields an oil (I. 22.) is the *Camellia Sasanqua*. Thbg. (C. oleifera. Abel.) The oil, styled Tea oil by Europeans, is \u8336\u6cb9 ch'a yu in Chinese.\n\nThe flower mo ly hoa (I. 23) is *Jasminum Sambac* L. v. supra Martini 19.\n\nThe tree kusey hoa, with fragrant flowers (I. 22.) is *Olea fragrans*. Thbg. v. supra Martini 20.\n\nThe flower lan hoa or lan wei hoa with unornamental yellowish but very fragrant flowers (I. 23.) is *Cymbidium ensifolium* Sw., in Chin: \u862d\u82b1 lan or \u862d\u8449\u82b1 lan wei hua.\n\nA tree called owen koang chu in Peking, with white flowers, and fruits with the appearance of a peach, but containing large black and hard seeds. (I. 23.). This is *Xanthoceras sorbifolia*. Bge. sin: \u6587\u51a0\u6a39 wen kuang shu.\n\n*Lien hoa* (I. 24.) *Nelumbium speciosum* W. (Martini 16.).\n\n*Pe tsai* (I. 24.) *Eleocharis tuberosus*. Schult. (Martini 14.)\n\nA peculiarity of the Chinese Cabbage, *pe tsai* is noticed, (I. 24.) which does not form heads like European Cabbage. This is *Brassica chinensis* L. sin: \u767d\u83dc pe ts'ai.\n\n*Rhubarb*, the Fou ling and the *Fe jou ling* (I. 25.) v. supra Martini 40, 41.\nI suppose, that by the medicinal herb Fen si described on the same page, the \u9632\u5df1 fang ki, Pen ts'ao XVIII b. 23, is meant. The Chinese plant of this name is however unknown to botanists. In Japan these characters denote Menispermum acutum. Thbg.\n\nAnother medicinal plant Ti hoang, of the province of Honan, is mentioned on p. 26. This is Rehmannia glutinosa. Lib. very common in the neighborhood of Peking, sin: \u5730\u9ec3 ti huang. According to Cibot: M\u00e9m. conc. Chin. V. 498 the root of it yields a yellow dye.\n\nWith respect to san tsi (p. 26.) see above the account given by Father Parennin of this plant.\n\nThe tree with long pods, tchang ko tse chu, Cassia fistula, in the province of Y\u00fcnnan (I. 26.) \u957f\u679c\u5b50\u6a39.\n\nCannelle Chinoise (Cassia bark) in the province of Quang si (I. 27.) v. supra Martini 21.\n\nThe plant Tien, used as a blue dye (I. 27.) is Indigofera tinctoria. L. sin: \u85cd\u5929. But Isatis indigotica has the same name.\n\nThe Cotton plant (II. 147.)\n\nThe kou chou is a tree, which has much the appearance of a fig tree. It contains a milky juice. Its leaves are divided into irregular lobes. The juice is used by gilders (II. 148.)\n\nThis is Broussonetia papyrifera. Vent. in Chinese \u7d19\u6a39 ku shu or \u7d19\u6a39 ch'u. Du Halde does not mention the principal use of this tree in China, a very strong paper being manufactured from its bark.\n\nOn the same page a much detailed but very obscure description is given of a tree called lung ju gu, the fruit of which has a peculiar stone containing an almond-like kernel. It seems to me that the first syllable of the name is wrong and we should read kia ju tsi', which according to Boym is the Chinese name for Anacardium occidentale.\n\nMo lien, a large tree with large deciduous leaves. It puts forth its conspicuous lily-like flowers before the leaves; some trees have red, others white or yellow flowers (II. 149.)\n\n\u6728\u84ee mu lien or \u6728\u862d mu lan is the Chinese name for Magnolia obovata. Thbg.\n\nLamo\u00eb, a tree with opposite leaves and yellow, very fragrant flowers, which the tree puts forth in winter (II. 149.)\n\nChimonanthus fragrans. Lindl. v. supra Semedo. 12.\n\nOu tong chu (II. 149) Sterculia platanifolia. Cav. v. supra Le Comte 9.\nThe *cha hoa* (II. 149.) is *Camellia japonica*. L. sin; \u8336\u82b1\nch'a hoa.\n\nDescription of a peculiar tree called *ts'e song* or *yuen pe*. Some of its leaves are prickly and resemble those of the Juniper tree, whilst other branches of the same tree present Cypress leaves. (II. 150).\n\nThis is *Juniperus chinensis* L. a large tree, which shows indeed the above mentioned peculiarity. Scale-like closely appressed leaves or linear spreading ones occur in different parts of the same tree. Its Chinese name is in Peking \u5e38\u7da0 *ts'e' sung* (prickly pine). The name \u6a1f\u67cf *yilan po* is applied to a different coniferous tree, according to Chinese books.\n\nOn the same page begins a long treatise on *Ginseng*, for the greater part a reproduction of Jartoux's memoir. It is accompanied with the drawing of the plant made by Jartoux.\n\nAmong the Chinese medicinal plants noticed in the 3d vol. of Du Halde's work, there is only one the name of which appears for the first time in the records of the Jesuits. On p. 496 is an account of certain *Galls* call *ou poey ts'e* and produced upon a tree *yen fou ts'e*.

In another chapter I shall have to speak of some Swedish travellers and naturalists, who half a century and more later, collected plants in the neighborhood of Canton or left accounts of their botanical observations in China.\n\nII JAMES CUNNINGHAM 1702.\n\nEleven years after E. Kaempfer had studied the Flora of Japan and brought home from that country about 500 plants, James Cunningham, an Englishman, had the opportunity of investigating the Flora of China at several points in the Empire. He has the merit of having been the first European, who made botanical collections in China and whose rich herbarium safely arrived home, where it was described by several distinguished botanists of that time. The only biographical particulars I have been able to gather with respect to Cunningham are: that in 1698 he was sent to China as a physician to the English factory at Amoy. He visited also the island of Oksean and was subsequently transferred to the island of Pulu Condore, where the English had also established a factory. The publisher of the Philosophical Transactions styles him F. R. S. Besides his botanical collections made in China, he had sent also to England a few plants from the island of Ascension, gathered on his way to China. Comp. Pultney's historical and biographical sketches of the progress of Botany (1790) II. 58\u2014and Sprengel's Geschichte der Botanik, II. 79.\n\nIn the Philosophical Transactions of the year 1702, vol. XXIII. p. 1201. sqq. two of Cunningham's letters treating of China and addressed to the editor of that Journal, have been published. As they are not very long, I shall reproduce them here, adding occasionally some explanatory notes. An abstract of these letters has already been given in vol. IX. p. 333 of the Chin. Repository.\n\nIt appears from the first of these letters that the ship in which Cunningham came out to China proceeded directly from England to Chusan. He does not allude in his letters, both written in 1701, to his stay at Amoy. But as among his Chusan plants described by Petiver we find also several noted as having been gathered on the island of Emmy, we can\nconclude, that C. went from Chusan to Amoy in 1703. We know from the \"New account of the East Indies\" published in 1723 by Capt. Hamilton, that the factory at Chusan was commenced by the E. I. Company in 1700 and abandoned by the chief supercargo Mr. Catchpole in 1703 by reason of the exactions of the Chinese government and the Company's neglecting to send money.\n\nCUNNINGHAM'S LETTERS ON CHINA.\n\nThe first of these letters bears no date. It seems to have been written in October 1701 (but perhaps in 1700). It reads as follows:\n\nSir! My last to you was from the island of Borneo, in which I gave you an account of our arrival there the 17th July, where we staid but two days, the season of the year being so far past, and from thence made the best of our way through the Strait of Banca with favourable winds and weather, till we came on the coast of China the 13th of August. There we had variable winds which carried us abreast of Emway the 19th following, at which time the north east winds setting in fresh, put us in great fears of losing our passage: whereupon we were forced to turn it up against wind and current all the way, the weather so favouring us, that we were never but by our topsails, else we should have lost more ground in one day, than we could have gained in eight. The last of August we came to an anchor under the Crocodile islands both to shelter us from the bad weather and also to look for fresh water, not having recruited since we came from the Cape of G. H. There are three small islands lying in the latitude of 26 degrees, about 6 leagues from the river of Hocktien; on two whereof we found very good fresh water with a convenient watering place on the south west side of the innermost of the three*. By the assistance of a few Chinese fishermen we procured some fresh provisions from the mainland, because we did not reckon it safe to adventure ourselves thither, lest we should have been brought into trouble by the government there. While we lay here, on the 5th of September, we had a sudden short shift of the monsoon to south-west, the fury whereof others felt, in coming upon the coast of China at the\n\n* There can be no doubt, that C.'s Crocodile islands are the Dogs' islands of modern maps, south east of the mouth of the Min river on which Fu chow (or Hok chiu in the local dialect) is situated.\nsame time. The 8th of September we put to sea again, turning to windward night and day without all the islands, which are very numerous along this coast, to which we were all together strangers beyond Emuy, and the hydrography thereof is hitherto so imperfect, that there was no trusting to our drafts, which made our navigation somewhat more dangerous. However on the first of October we got into the latitude of 30\u00b0, where we came to an anchor near the land, until we found the way by boat to Chusan,* about 12 leagues within the islands, from whence we had a pilot, who carried us safely thither on the 11th of October. Upon this island the Chinese have granted us a settlement and liberty of trade, but not to Ningpo, which is 6 or 8 hours sail to the westward, all the way amongst islands; this being the largest, is 8 or 9 leagues in length from E. to W. and 4 to 5 in breadth, about 3 leagues from that point of the mainland called Cape Liampo by the Portuguese, but Khi tu\u2020 by the Chinese. At the westend of this island is the harbour, very safe and convenient, where the ships ride within call of the factory, which is built close by the shore on a low plain valley, with near 200 houses about it for the benefit of trade, inhabited by men, whose jealousy has not as yet permitted them to let their wives dwell here; for the town where they are, is \u00bc of a mile further from the shore, environed with a fine stone wall, about 3 miles in circumference, mounted with 22 square bastions placed at irregular distances, besides 4 great gates, on which are planted a few old iron guns, seldom or never used; the houses within are very meanly built. Here the Chumpeen\u2021 or governor of the island lives and betwixt 3 or 4000 beggarly inhabitants, most part soldiers and fishermen; for, the trade of this place being newly granted, has not as yet brought any considerable merchants hither. The island\n\n* The island of Chusan, the largest of the group marked as Chusan Archipelago on our maps, is immediately opposite the mouth of the river on which Ningpo is situated. The Chinese call it \u5b9a\u6d77 Ting hai, which is properly the name of a district city on this island. \u5d07\u5c71 Chou shan (Chiu san in the local dialect) is an ancient name of it not found on modern Chinese maps. The island of Chusan is not to be confounded with Port Chusan, on the south-eastern coast of Korea, where Ch. Wilford collected plants about a quarter of a century ago.\n\n\u2020 A long projecting promontory opposite Chusan, \u822a\u982d K'i fou of Chinese, Ke tow point of English maps.\n\n\u2021 \u798f\u5175 Tsung ping, a general.\nin general abounds with all sort of provision, such as cows, buffaloes, goats, deer, hogs wild and tame, geese, ducks, hens; rice, wheat, calavances, coleworts, turnips, potatoes, carrots, beets, and spinach; but for merchandize there is none but what comes from Ningpo, Hangchou, Nankin and the island towns, some of which I hope to see, when I have acquired a little of the Chinese language.\n\nHere also the Tea grows in great plenty on the tops of the hills, but it is not in that esteem which what grows on more mountainous islands. Although this island is pretty well stored with people, yet it is far from what it was in Father Martini's time, when he describes Chusan, and this puts me in mind, that the superstitious pilgrimages thereto, mentioned by him, must be meant of the island Pow tof, which lies 9 leagues from hence and 3 miles to the eastward of this island, whither (they say) the Emperor designs in the month of May next (being his birthday and the 40th of his age) to come to worship in an ancient pagod there, famous for sanctity, having sent one of his bonzes already thither, to get all things in order.\n\nChusan. November 22. 1701.\n\nSir! I formerly told you that the Emperor designed to have come to the island of Pow tos to worship in the month of May last, being the 40th year of his age, I should have said of his reign. But all things being prepared there for his reception, he was dissuaded from his purpose by some of his mandarins, who made him believe that the terrible thunder there was very dangerous. This Pow to is a small island about 5 leagues round at the east end of this island, famous for the superstitious pilgrimages made thither for the space of 1100 years. It is inhabited only by bonzes, to the number of 3000, all of the sect called Ho shang\u2020, or unmarried bonzes, who live a Pythagorean life; and there they have built 400 pagodas, two whereof are considerable for their greatness and finery, being lately covered with green and yellow tiles brought from the emperor's palace at Nankin, and inwardly adorned with stately idols finely graved and gilded, the chief whereof is the idol Quan sm\u00a7. To these two great pagodas belong two chief\n\n---\n\n\u2020 Delichos sinensis L.\n\n\u2021 \u6885\u82b1\u5c71 Pu to shan. This island is indeed exclusively occupied by Buddhist priests. It has 78 Buddhist temples. In the description of his Chinese plants Cunningham mentions some other islands of the Chinese Archipelago viz.: Thow why sau \u6843\u82b1\u5c71\u2014Pusa si sau.\n\n\u00a7 \u958b\u5143 Ho shang, a Buddhist priest.\n\n\u00a7 Kuan yin, \u89c0\u97f3\u2014the Goddess of Mercy.\npriests, who govern all the rest. They have several ways and avenues cut through the island, some of which are paved with flagstones and overshadowed with trees planted on each side. Their dwellings are the best I have yet seen in these parts; all of which are maintained by charitable devotions. And the junks which go from Ningpo and this place to Japan touch there both going and coming, to make their offerings for their good success. There is another island called Kimtong, 5 leagues hence in the way to Ningpo, whither, they say, a great many mandarins retire, to live a quiet life after they have given over their employments. On that island also are said to be silver mines, but prohibited to be opened. The rest of the circumjacent islands are either desert or meanly inhabited by a few fishing people, but all of them stored with abundance of deer. For it is not long, since this island of Chusan began to be peopled. It is true in Martini's days, about fifty years ago, it was very populous for the space of 3 to 4 years, at which time the fury of the Tartarian conquest was so great, that they left it desolate, not sparing so much as the Mulberry trees, for then they made a great deal of raw silk here, and in this condition it continued till about 18 years ago, that the walls of the fort or town, which now is, were built by the governor of Ting hai, for a garrison to expell some pirates, who had taken shelter here. About 14 years ago the island beginning to be peopled, there was a chumpeen or general sent to govern it for 3 years, to whom succeeded the late chumpeen, who procured the opening of this port to strangers and whose government continued till April last, being translated to the Chumpeen of Tien cing wei, near to Pekin, and was succeeded by the present chumpeen, who is son to the old Chum keen of Emuy.\n\nThey have got no arts or manufactories here, but making of lacquered ware, a particular account whereof I cannot as yet send you. They begin to plant the mulberry trees, to breed up worms for the production of raw silk and they make some Tea, but chiefly for their own use. The three sorts of Tea commonly carried to England are all from the same plant, only the season of the year and the soil makes the difference. The Boke, or Voii, || so-called after some mountains in the\n\n\u2022 \u91d1\u5858\u5c71 Xin tang shan.\n\u2020 \u970d\u5929\u5ead Hua tian ting fu.\n\u2021 \u4e2d\u5ead Chung kien.\n\u2020 \u6b66\u5937 Wu yi, in Amoy be ke.\nprovince of Fokien, where it is chiefly made, is the very first but gathered in the beginning of March, and dried in the shade. The Bing * tea is the second growth in April, and Sung lo \u2020 the last, in May and June, both dried a little in pans over the fire. The Teashrub being an evergreen is in flower from October to January and the seed is ripe in September and October following, so that one may gather both flowers and seed at the same time, but for one fresh and full seed there are a hundred nought. These make up the two sorts of fruit in Le Comte's description of tea: as for his other sort, which he calls flymic pease, they were nothing but the young buds of the flowers not yet opened. Its seedvessels are really 3 capsular, each capsule containing one nut or seed, and, although two or one capsule only come to perfection, yet the vestiges of the rest may be discerned. It grows in a dry gravelly soil, on the sides of hills, in several places of the island without any cultivation.\n\nLe Comte is mistaken in saying (p. 96) that the Chinese are wholly strangers to the art of grafting, for I have seen a great many of his paradoxical Tallow trees ingrafted here, besides some other trees. When they ingraft, they do not slit the stock as we do, but cut a small slice off the outside of the stock, to which they apply the graft, bringing up the bark of the slice upon the outside of the graft, they tye all together covering with straw and mud as we do.\n\nMartini says he could never find a Latin name for the Fula Moyorin of the Portuguese (v. supra Martini 19). I am sure it is the same with the Syringa arabica flore pleno also in Parkinsonse. \u2021\n\nHe says also, that the Kieu yen or Tallow tree bears a white flower like a Cherry tree, but all that I have seen here bears a spike of small yellow flowers like the julus of a Salix. ||\n\nThe Bean or Mandarin Broth, so frequently mentioned in the Dutch Embassy and by other authors is only an emulsion made of the seed of Sesamum and hot water.\u00a7\n\n* \u8336 Ming, in Amoy beng.\n\u2020 \u6652\u5e72 Sung lo, name of a mountain, see above Martini 23.\n\u2021 Cunningham is right. Lamarck Enc. bot. IV 210 quotes the Syringa arabica (already known to Clusius) as a synonym of Jasminum Sambac. Ait.\n|| Cunningham's statement is correct. See above Martini 86. note.\n\u00a7 In the narrative of the third Dutch Embassy a Bean soup is mentioned which they believed to be prepared with milk and Peking butter (sic!). But it seems to me that the above statements of Cunningham and the Dutch are to be referred to the Chinese condiment commonly called Bean curd by Europeans. (Williams' Middle Kingdom, II. 48.)\n(I omit the particulars given with respect to fishing, tillage, and obtaining of salt.)\n\nHad I not found the printed Newspapers last year take notice of a singular root brought from China by F. Fontaney, * I should not have told you that I have seen one since I came here, called Hu chu wu (which I take to be the same), whereto they ascribe wonderful properties of prolonging life and turning gray hairs into black, by drinking its infusion for some time, in so much that they say it is to be had in value from 10 taels to 1000 or 2000 a single root, for the larger it is, the more is its value and efficacy: which is too much money here to try the experiment. You have it mentioned in Cleyer's Medicina sinica, 84, under the name of Ho zew u. It is likewise painted in the 27 table of those plants Mr. Petiver has of me.\u2020\n\nAfter this C. relates a Chinese legend with respect to this root. A man fell down from a precipice and found himself in a valley from which he was not able to come out. He lived there for a hundred years feeding on the above-mentioned root. He was finally delivered by an earthquake, which destroyed the valley.\n\nCunningham distributed his Chinese botanical collection, made in Chusan, at Amoy and on the Dogo islands near Fu chou, among his friends in England. Plukenet and Petiver seem to have received the greatest part of it. I may be allowed to say here a few words with respect to these ardent and able botanists and their works, in which they described and depicted Cunningham's plants, soon after they had received them.\n\nJames Petiver, Apothecary of the Charterhouse, London, and secretary to the Royal Society, an active collector of objects of natural history, born about 1658 + 1718. He had correspondents in most parts of the world, who sent him productions, plants, animals, etc. He was a friend of the botanist Ray and of Sir Hans Sloane, the celebrated promotor of science and President of the Royal Society (born 1660 + 1752), who offered\n\n* Joannes de Fontaney, Jesuit Missionary in China, end of the 17th cent.\n\n\u2020 What C. tells with respect to the plant \u963f\u9996\u70cf ho shou wu is found also in Chinese works. A good drawing of it is given in the Chin. Botany Chi wu ming shi t'u k'ao XX. 16, a climbing plant with a large tuberous root, and this agrees with the engraving under the same Chinese name in the Japanese Botany Somo kou etc VII. 80, which according to Franchot and Savatier (Ennm. pl. Japon. I 402.) is Polygonum multiflorum Thbg. and has in fact tuberous roots.\nhim \u00a34000 for his collections of specimens. As the Sloanian collection subsequently gave origin to the British Museum (Hanbury's Science p. 384) Petiver's specimens may also be stored there.\n\nIn a paper published in the XXIII. vol. of the Philosophical Transactions (1708) Petiver describes about 70 Chinese plants supplied principally by Cunningham. But previously he had published in his Museum (1692-1703) short characteristics of 1000 exotic plants, amongst which we find scattered about 100 from China, the greatest part of them not mentioned in the Philosoph. Trans. Besides this he issued his Gasophylacii Naturaes Decades decem, 1702-1709, short descriptions and engravings of 100 exotic plants, about 20 of which were selected from Cunningham's Chin. collection.\n\nIt appears from Cunningham's letters and from Petiver's quotations that the latter had also received from C. a collection of Chinese drawings representing Chinese plants. Petiver frequently speaks of \"Herbarium nostrum sinense pictum.\"\n\nLeonard Plukenet, born 1642-1705, a learned English botanist, educated at Oxford. He was in war with Sloane and Petiver. Plukenet has published many botanical works and described and depicted a great number of new plants especially from America, the East Indies and China. Almost all Chinese plants he mentions had been handed to him by Cunningham, and it seems that the latter had entrusted the greatest part of his herbarium to Plukenet, who described about 400 Chinese specimens in his Amaltheum botanicum seu Stirpium Indicarum alterum copiae cornu 1705, intermixed with American and Indian plants. Nearly one half of the Chinese plants Plukenet faithfully figured in vol. III of his Phytographia*. These figures are small and often much reduced from the natural size, but are generally very characteristic.\n\nIn 1779 Dr. P. D. Gieseke added an Index Linneanus in Plukenetii opera botanica, in which he ascertained a great number of the plants there described and figured, but with respect to the Chinese specimens in the Phytographia he has only in a few cases been able to identify them.\n\nPerhaps the botanist Ray (1628-1705) disposed also of a part of Cunningham's plants. In his Historia plantarum, in the 3d vol. (1704) he describes some of them. It may be\n\n* The 3rd vol. of Plukenetii l'hytographia bears the date 1692. But this is evidently an error for each engraving in it is referred to the text in the Amaltheum, published 1705. Pl. published also an Almagestum Botanicum, 1696, in which a few Chinese plants appear.\nhowever, that he copied from Petiver and Plukenet. I have seen the Hist. plant, but had then no opportunity of comparing it with the Amaltheum and Petiver's works. As appears from Petiver's statements, C. had given also to Sloane some of his specimens.\n\nOn the whole, nearly 600 Chinese plants have been described by Petiver and Plukenet from Cunningham's specimens. It would be interesting to know what has become of this herbarium. Petiver's botanical collections as well as those of Plukenet had been acquired by Sloane and were finally incorporated into the British Museum, where they may still exist, or at least some \"rudera\" of them.\n\nAfter Cunningham, botanical collections have been made twice at Chusan, as far as I know. Dr. Th. Cantor visited the island in 1840 and in an account of Cantor's botanical collections in the Journ. As. Soc. Beng. XXIII. 1854, Mr. Griffith enumerates 133 plants gathered at Chusan, but he gives generally nothing more but the genus names. There is only one plant of the collection he describes as new, viz. *Actinostemma tenerum*. I am not aware whether Cantor's herbarium is now in England or in India.\n\nThe well known traveller and botanical collector R. Fortune (who died in April 1880) investigated the Flora of Chusan some years later. He first came to that island in 1843 and visited it again in 1850. His plants, distributed by the R. Hort. Soc., are found in all the more important herbariums of Europe. It seems that only a small part of Fortune's Chinese plants have been described.\n\nConcerning the Crocodile islands (Dogs islands near Fu chou) where Cunningham gathered some specimens, the botanical features of these islands are probably the same as those of the adjacent mainland. The Flora of that part of China, and I must say the same with respect to Amoy, is very imperfectly known. But all plants gathered at those places may, I believe, be found in Dr. Hance's magnificent herbarium, and he is probably the only botanist who would be able to identify Cunningham's plants from the ancient descriptions and drawings left.\n\nA great part of Cunningham's plants, described and depicted by Petiver and Plukenet, are probably included in the later collections alluded to. I therefore have thought it would be useful to bring under the notice of modern botanists and to place together the scattered remarks and diagnoses referring to Cunningham's plants, as found in the Amaltheum.\nand in Petiver's writings. But as the descriptions there are often long and detailed, I cannot venture to reproduce the whole and shall often confine myself to quoting only the short diagnoses, which generally precede the descriptions, referring the reader to the original works and the drawings. The latter of course will be more serviceable to identify the plants in question, than the descriptions given.\n\nMUSCI PETIVERIANI CENTURIAE DECIM BARIORA NATURAE CONTINENS\n\nLondon 1692\u20141703. 2 tab.\n\nThis is an enumeration of exotic plants, from Asia, the Cape of G. H. and America. I extract the following notes on Chinese plants found there. These Chinese specimens were gathered, as Petiver states, chiefly by Cunningham, a few of them also by Keir and Barklay, surgeons, and Sum. Brown. The latter visited Chusan before Cunningham.\n\nThe first century mentions three Chinese Ferns.\n\nAdiantum nigrum chinense, tenuiter divisum, pinnulis minimis obtusis bifidis. Pluk.

XXIII (1703.) p. 1421. The first 20 numbers refer to Corals from the Philippine Islands.\n\n21. *Lingua cervina chusanensis maculata media*.\n\nThe root of this is like our common Polypody with fibres running from them. The leaves resemble Harts-tongue, but are longer and narrower, but as that bears its seed in slant streaks on the back of the leaves, these have them in round spots like those in Polypody, one on each side of the middle rib at near half an inch distance, beginning near the point, and reach above half the leaf.\n\n22. *Lingua cervina chusanensis maculata, parva*.\n\nThis has a fibrous root, its leaves have scarcely any footstalk and rarely exceed 3 inches in length, the seeds stand in round spots like the last, as large but much closer set, reaching from the middle rib to the edge of the leaf, coming down about half way.\n\n23. *Arundo chusanensis polydactyloides, perelegans*.\n\nThis reed has a very beautiful tuft, composed of about a dozen papoose spikes, like some of our Indian downy Cocksfoot grass, each above a span long.\n\n24. *Gramen Lagopoides chusanense, spicis aristatis pallescentibus*.\nThis is next in kind to our Gr. Ligop. guineensis, Gazoph. nat. tab. 2, fig. 7, et. Mus. 238, but its spikes are larger and both glumae and aristae are whitish; whereas the Guinea sort when full ripe is ferrugineous and its spike turns downwards. Dr. H. Sloane has the only specimen I have as yet seen of this new grass.\n\n25. Panicum cristatum chusanense; spica multiplici nude.\nThis is a very elegant grass, each capsule somewhat resembles those of our Nasturtium verrucosum or Swines Cress.\n\n26. Secalis facie frumentum chusanicum.\n\n27. Cadelari siciliana folio acuto, Amaranthus siculus spicatus.\nThis is Achyranthes argentea Lam., a variety of A. aspera L. observed in China by Stanton and others.\n\n28. Persicaria chinensis; folio subtus albidus, Musae nostri 950.\nThis resembles our Arse-smart, but the leaves underneath are very white and soft.\n\n29. Triopterus scandens chusanensis, cordato folio.\nThis is a twining plant, like our black Bryony, and its leaves not unlike, the capsules resemble the Melianthus, but have only three wings containing membranaceous seed, like those of the Oleander.\n\n30. Aster Eupatoroides chusanensis, Hyssopi folio.\nThe leaves stand alternately on the stalk, which towards the top branches out into many small flowers with little radiated petals. These look at first view like our Eupatorium.\n\n31. Tussilago chusanensis, ramosa, folio rotundo, glabro.\nThis has smooth round leaves about the root at the time of the flowering, and narrow leaves at the stalk, which is branched, each terminating in one flower of the same likeness with ours.\n\n32. Abrotanum chusanense, Thalictrum folio.\nThe leaves are deeply jagged at top, generally into 3 or 5 segments. The flowers are extremely small.\n\n33. Abrotanum chusan. segmentis foliorum tenuissime serratis.\nThe flowers of this are as large as the common Southernwood, the leaves finely divided and notched like those of some umbelliferous plants.\n\n34. Absinthium umbelliferum chusan, Achovan folio.\nThe stalk is round, hoary and slightly furrowed, the leaves somewhat like the next, but less, and more serrated.\n\n35. Matricaria chusan. flore albo minore simplici. A Matricaria japonica fl. min. albo simpl. Breyn. prod. 2. p. 663?\nThe leaves of this are like Mugwort but less, the flowers scarcely so big as our Featherfew.\n36. Matricaria chusan. flore luteo minore simplici, hoa Chinensis.\nThe leaves and flowers are much like the last, the discus is large and yellow as are the petals about.\n\nProbably Pyrethrum (Chrysanthemum) indicum. Cass: sin: \u83ca\u82b1\nYe ku hua.\n\n37. Verbenaca chusan. Majoranae folio, subtus molli, flavescens.\nOn each side of every joint come forth longish leaves, some bigger, others less, soft underneath and yellowish. From some of these joints, especially towards the top, come spikes of flowers and seed, after the manner of common Vervain.\n\n38. Verbenaca chusan. Persicari\u00e6 folio subtus pallescens.\nThe stalk is for the most part 5 square, the leaves grow opposite, by turns crosswise. It bears a long spike of flowers, each with a long tube or neck set in a small turgid calyx.\n\n39. Mentha chusan. spicata holosericea.\nThe stalks of this plant are very hoary and soft, as are its leaves, especially the under side.\n\n40. Teucrium chusan. flore singulari pediculo semiuncialis insidentis.\nEach flower stands single on a half inch foot stalk, with 4 long stamens, and a style like the Teucrium Boeoticum.\n\n41. Teucrium Crocodyliaenum. Styracis folio minore. Gas. nat. tab. 84, fig. 11.\n\n42. Alcea forte fruticosa chusan. folio summo lato, subtus molli.\nThe leaves are somewhat like our Aspen-tree, very broad at the top, with a small point in the middle, slightly notched, a little rough above, but underneath very soft.\n\nHibiscus tiliaceus. L.\n\n43. Rubus chusan. folio Corchori.\nThe twigs and footstalks are thorny, the leaves single, sometimes lobated, broad at base, but grow tapering to a very narrow point.\n\nPerhaps Rubus corchorifolius. L. of Japan.\n\n44. Rubi facie planta chusan. folio Altheae acutioris.\nThe stalks thorny, the leaves grow alternately on short pedioles, and some of them are lobated. At the bottom of each grows a small scaly cone like a bud.\n\n45. Alectrolophus chusan. viscosa, Achovan folio.\nThis and the next seem very elegant plants, but I dare not meddle with their descriptions until I receive better specimens of them.\n46. *Rapunculus seu Cardinalis*, forte *Chusan*. Sambuci folio.\n\n47. *Anonis chusan*. pubescens, Lupini facie.\n\nThis seems herbaceous, the leaves are very large, somewhat hoary, but the stalks much more, the flowers spicated and large, resembling the yellow Lupine, but have the face and hoariness of the common blue.\n\n48. *Astragalus chusan*. sinapis siliqua.\n\nThese leaves resemble the Saint Foin, the pods are about 3 inches long, with 2 or 3 swellings, and end blade-pointed like the pods of mustard.\n\n49. *Conchage chusan*. floribus parvis ex alis foliorum.\n\nThe stalks, young leaves, flowerhusks, and pods have all a rusty hoariness, in the full grown leaves it is much less. From the bosom of these comes a small spike of little flowers, by which and its hoariness it is easily distinguished from all others.\n\n50. *Oxytus chusan*. tetraflorus.\n\nIts leaves are small, finely veined and end in a hair. What is peculiar in this, is to have 4 flowers on a naked or leafless inch foot stalk.\n\n51. *Polygala chusan*. folio subrotundo, spica aphylla.\n\nThis is distinguished from others in having broader obtuse leaves, excepting towards the top they are a little pointed and from the middle of each leafy stalk comes out a naked spike of flowers.\n\n52. *Androsace chusan*. Cortusae Matthioli folio. Mns. nost. 858. Gazoph. tab. 33, fig. 8.\n\nSeems to be *Androsace saxifragae folia* Bge.\n\n53. *Lysimachia chusan*. Gentianellae folio, flore albo.\n\nThis in manner of growing resembles our yellow Loostrife, but the flowers are white, petala less, and more pointed. Its capsule ends in a thread. I saw a branch of this in flower and seed with Mr. Sam. Doody, which Mr. George Loudon had gathered in some garden, I think about town.\n\n54. *Lysimachia chusan*. spicata, Persicariae folio, flore exiguo.\n\nThese leaves grow inordinately, are narrow-pointed at base, without footstalks. At the top of the branches grow slender spikes like Arsmart, with small flowers and seed vessels like Flax, but much less.\n\n55. *Ros Solis chusan*. perelegans, caule folioso. Mns. 968.\n\nThis is a very familiar sort of Sundew, in having leaves on the stalks, which towards the top ramify and flower.\n\nTrees.\n\n*Chusan*. foliis acutissimis.\nThis resembles the Silver-fir but the leaves are somewhat serrated and very sharp.\n\nPerhaps *Abies Kampferi* Lindl.\n\n57. *Acer forte chusan*. folio minore trifida.\n\nThese leaves very much resemble the *Acer monspelianum* I.B. They are smooth above and glaucous underneath, standing on long slender reddish stalks. The fruit of this and the next I have not yet seen.\n\nPerhaps the Japanese *Acer trifidum*. Thbg., observed also near Ningpo.\n\n58. *Aceris folio arbor chusan*. virgulis spinosissimis.\n\nIts young branches are reddish and very full of brier-like thorns, amongst these leaves inordinately grow, the base of each pedicle leaving an impression like a V consonant on the stalk. The leaves have very much the face of the common great Maple or Sycamore with long pedicles, whose base agrees with the branches.\n\n59. *Alaternus chusan*. Arbuti folio. Gazoph. tab. 36. *Thea chusan*. floribus majoribus, folio Alaterni serrato Mus. noet 983.\n\nBy its leaves and flowers I at first took it for a Tea, but having lately received it in barry, I find it to be another family. The leaves are stiff, serrated, and pointed, generally thickest towards the tops of the branches. From the bosom of these and below grow many small flowers close to the stalk, which are succeeded by little berries, that are both calyculated and pointed.\n\n60. *Arbor chusan*. *Frangulae folio majore subtus albidio molli*.\n\nAlthough I have not yet seen the flower or fruit of this tree, yet I could not omit it, because its leaves are very distinguishable from any that have yet come from this island. They seem, especially the young ones, to have the texture and face on the upper side of our Frangula or Alderberry, yet somewhat softer, but its peculiarity is underneath, in being white, softish and having its middle vein spongy, and towards the stalk rusty coloured, as are its younger branches.\n\n61. *Baccifera chusan*. Caryophyllaromatis folio, Patzjotti flore.\n\nThe leaves resemble those of cloves, but are somewhat thicker, generally about 1\u00bd inch broad and 3 long, growing alternately. From the bosom of each come 3 or 4 pentapetalous flowers somewhat like the Malabar Patzjotti (Hort. malab. vol. 5.) each filled with large curled like spices ending pointed. These are succeeded by black berries set in a small 5 starred calyx, its point \u00bc of an inch; each standing on a half inch foot stalk. Out of one berry I took 11, from another near 20 small shining brown seeds, of different shapes from their lying together.\n62. *Baccifera chusan*. Ligustri facie.\n\nIts larger woolly twigs are smooth, cinereous and speckled, the smallest woolly, the leaves grow by pairs, at the top come the flowers, loosely spiked, each in a small cupped calyx, the berries less than currants, black with a bluish cast, each on a very short footstalk and in an undetermined cup, which seemed to want a part on one side. In each berry is one large oval kernel.\n\n63. *Buxus chusan*. folio praelongo.\n\nThis has the face and the texture of the common Box, but the leaves are longer, very narrow at the base, broadest near the middle and blunt at the end.\n\n64. *Buxi affinis Emuyaca*, folio rugoso.\n\nThe twigs are reddish and rough, as are the under sides of the leaves, but smoother above. They stand on very short footstalks and have this particular, that the upper half of each leaf is somewhat lobated or largest. At the ends of the branches grow commonly two or more rough capsules gaping like the Fagaras. Each of these contains 1 or 2 black oval shining seed somewhat bigger than an Oat.\n\n65. *Camphora officinarum*. The Camphire tree.\n\nIt is very well figured and amply described in Breynius centuria (in 1678) and first Prodromus.\n\n66. *Castanea chusan*. folio fere serrato, subtus glauco.\n\nThe twigs are blackish with many small warts, the leaves grow inordinately, on short pedicles, most of them more or less thorny, dented, and some smooth. Underneath they are glaucous and somewhat soft.\n\n67. *Coccifera chusan*. Coryli folio, floribus exignis racemiferis. Gazoph. tab. 36, fig. 7.\n\nIts twigs are speckled, the leaves of different magnitude and breadth, lightly serrated, standing on an inch footstalk. At the top of each twig grows a small racemos spike of little flowers, which are succeeded by dry berries, growing like currants.\n\n*Cocciferae* produce trees and shrubs, as have dry berries like the Coccoidea, in opposition to those, that are moist, as gooseberries.\n\n68. *Cocca*. folio marginibus crispis.\n\nThe bark of this is furrowed irregularly like Elder, its leaves are smooth and shape of a Willow Bay, but peculiarise themselves growing the edges unevenly inwards, which make the outside and inside them seem curled. Their berries scarce bear the Cocca, or dry berry, like the\nAllspice or Jamaica Pepper, is set in a 4 or 5 starred calyx in a loose cluster, each on an \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch footstalk. Between the outward skin and kernel, which is solid and very hard, is but little space.\n\n69. *Orista Pavonis Chinensis*. Abrus folio. *Bo ya hoa* Herbar. nust. Chin. tab. 2, fig. 4.\n\n*Hoa* in the Chinese language signifies a flower. The leaves are much less and narrower than the American kind, otherwise in its spikes, flowers and way of growing it very much resembles it.\n\n*Orista Pavonis* is *Adenanthera pavonina* L. Lam. Enc. Bot. II 76 mentions it as a native of China. Dr. Hance has observed it in Hongkong.\n\n70. *Cupressus chusae*. Abietis folio. Gasoph. Tab. 6. fig. 3.\n\nWhere you may with its figure see a description of its leaves and seed.\n\nIt bears its cones single at the end of each branch; the scales of these, when they are open or cracked, are serrated and rugged.\n\nAs we have stated above (Gasoph. l.c.) this is *Cryptomeria japonica*. Don.\n\n71. *Euonymo affinis chusae*. Fraxini folio, semine nigro.\n\nThe leaves grow opposite, and generally 3 pairs tailed, i.e. one at the end. The footstalk is very short and next the tail scarce any. The fruit grows in clusters, each husk rugose, including one black shining seed.\n\n72. *Fagara Emeyaca* Fraxini folio.\n\nThis is distinguished from the next in having much broader leaves. They grow opposite and are much like the Ash. The berries are about the bigness of Pepper and grow in small clusters. The tender shoots and first sprouts are prickly, in the more grown they are not so discernable. I have not as yet observed any prickles on the leaves of this kind except in its first shoots, which are very small and wear off as they grow older.\n\nI call *Fagaceae* those trees and shrubs, whose berries split like those figured by Garcias ab Horto, Gerard, Parkinson, Clusius, etc. There are also these peculiarities, which generally attend this tribe, viz., the branches are prickly and often the leaves on the underside and middle rib, and sometimes on both sides and the lesser veins. The berries split in the middle and discover a black shining seed, the outer skin rough, tastes hot and spicery. The leaves in all I have yet observed are perforated like St. Johns wort, Orange leaves, Myrtle. The Hercules and prickly yellow woods of the W. Indies are of this family.\n\nThe genus to which the *Fagaceae* of the ancient botanists belong is now called *Fagaceae*. Linn.\n73. *Fagara chusan*. *Fraxini* folio angustiore.\n\nThe leaves of this are not only narrower than the last, but prickly underneath and the prickles are very thick set on the branches and between the leaves.\n\n74. *Fagara chusan*. *Rhois virginianae* folio, canle alato. What chaw in Chinese. Gazoph. tab. 36, fig. 8.\n\nThese leaves very much resemble the Virginian Sumach, with a winged or welted stalk, with lightly serrated transparent notches. Dr. Sloan has a fair specimen of this in fruit, which ripens in October.\n\nAs has been shown above, this seems to be *Zanthoxylum Bungal*. Pl. sin: \u82b1\u6912 hua tsiao.\n\n75. *Frutex chusan*. *Fagi* folio, fructu sulcato.\n\nThis very much resembles No. 926 Musae nostris, but is in all parts much larger, especially its leaves, which are very like the Carolina plant at No. 915. Its fruit grows naked at the top of the branches from a reversed calyx, and is sulcated like the capsule of an Adhatode.\n\n76. *Gelsemium chusan*. folio Betae hirsuto.\n\nThe leaves somewhat like Beet, but hoary, the flower is leaved, in shape much resembling Nerium. The spicules on each stamen seem double headed, the calyx is quinqued and hoary. It grows spikated, as I observed in a very large specimen amongst Dr. Sloane's dry plants.\n\n77. *Hedera arborea* C. B. 305. l.\n\nI can see no difference between this and our common Tree Ivy. (*Hedera Helix* L. var. arborea).\n\nI may observe that among Cantor's Chusan plants *Hedera Helix*. L. is mentioned.\n\n78. *Spurge Laurel*.\n\nPet. means *Daphne laureola*. L.\u2014Fortune has gathered *D. Fortunei* Lindl. in Chusan.\n\n79. *Lycium chusan*. *Pruni minoris* folio.\n\nThe twigs of this end in a thorn, the leaves are like the slow but less-finely serrated, growing inordinately on very short stalks. The berries are black and wrinkled like pepper and of that bigness. They stand on a $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch footstalk in a small round calyx. Under the thin outer skin lies one or two kernels.\n\nAn undetermined species of *Lycium* is noticed in Cantor's collection. *L. chinense* L. has been observed in North-China as well as in the South.\n\n80. *Mandara forte chusan*. folio acuminato, alte bifido.\n\nThe leaves which are all of this plant I have yet seen, seem to be of the Malabar kind of Mandaru. The leaf is deep cut and glaucous underneath.\nMandarin is Bauhinia. 8 species of it are known from Southern China via B. glauca Wall., B. Championi. Benth., B. chinensis Vogel.\n\n81. Mori facie chusan. folio subtus molli ferrugineo.\n\n82. Ou tum chu. P. Le Comte. Gou tum shu Herb. nostr. Chin. tab. 6.\u2014Gazoph. tab. 27. folio trifido, petalis bacciferis.\n\nThis is a wonderful tree and very particular in the product of its berries, which I take to be the fruit. The flowers grow separate from the leaves in a large loose or sparse tuft, after the manner of Fraxinella or Dittander, from the larger stem each little one has many flowers, composed of 5 broad green petals or leaves like those of our Adderstongue, every one standing on \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch pedicle starwise. On both the edges of these grow one or more stalkless berries, of the bigness of Holy, rugged now dry. I opened one of them. A large white cavity and a small decayed substance only remained in it.\n\nPetiver gives a correct description of Stereolla platani folia. Cav. (see above Le Comte), only he takes the spreading follicles of the fruit for flowers.\n\n83. Palisera Emuyaca major folio rotundiore.\n\nThis seems to differ from our European sort in having its leaves much larger and round.\n\nProbably Palisera Ashletii Shalt. which has been observed in South China and Japan.\n\n84. Palmiga Christi vulgaris facie, forte Chusan. canibus et foliis pubescentibus.\n\nVery near the basis of the footstalk of each leaf it has 2 long and very narrow threadlike auricles.\n\n85. Pimenta Chusan. folio Alaterni. Gazoph. tab. 26.\n\nThea chusan. floribus minoribus, folio Alaterni cuspidato. Mus. nostr. 984.\n\nIts leaves stand on short footstalks, they are pointed, stiff and somewhat notched. From the bosom of these and at the top of the branches come forth many small flowers, full of stamens like the Tea but much less, which made me conclude it was of that family. But Mr. Cunningham has since sent it me in fruit, which I find a small dry berry of an oval bottle shape, coronated somewhat like a clove.\n\n86. Populi facie chusan. folio subtus molli ferrugineo.\n\nThis has the shape, thickness and softness of Abele leaves, but instead of white is rusty coloured underneath.\n\n87. Quercus chusan. Castanaceae folio pubescente.\n\nThe stalk and the underside of the leaves are hoary. Its catkin or julus round and echinated, as Dr. Cunningham says, but its acorn small and smooth.\nQuercus chinensis Bge. of North-China has leaves resembling those of the chestnut.\n\n88. *Rhamnus Emuyacu maritimus*, flore coeruleo.\n\nThe leaves like Sea Purslain but smaller and nearly stalkless. From them towards the top of the branches come 2\u20133 pentapetalous flowers set in a like divided calyx. The footstalks of some of them are near \u00bd inch.\n\n89. *Rhoe Emuyaca folio serrato subtus molli, rachi alato*.\n\nSome of these leaves are broader and more or less serrated than others. The stalk is larger or smaller winged as the twigs are older or younger. Mr. Cunningham says they eat the berries which are sour and have a dew on them. He further observes, that from the broken branches there issues out a turpentine like balsamic liquor.\n\nPerhaps *Rhoe semialata* Murr. which is found in North-China as well as in the South, or *Rhoe chinensis* Mill.\n\n90. *Ricinus chinensis sebifera*, Populi nigrae folio. Gasoph. tab. 34, fig. 3. Mus. nat. 965. Kiew-yen P. Martini in Atl. sin.\n\nThe leaves grow alternately on long slender footstalks, some of them much extended in the middle and very sharp pointed. The flowers are yellow, mighty small, and grow in a slender catkin like those in Hazel. The fruit is about the bigness of a middling nut, smooth, blackish, and trisulcated, opening into 3 parts, discovers as many white seeds, from whence and its kernels, I suppose, the suet or fat is produced, each being covered with a white fatty body, under which is a brown hard shell, containing an unctuous kernel, which by bruising turns almost wholly to an oil.\n\nMr. Sam. Brown first sent me this some years ago from China, since which I have received it from Emoy and Chusan. There are two young trees of this now growing, September 27. 1703, in the Charterhouse, raised this year by Mr. Cole Gardiner.\n\nThe tree here described is *Stillingia sebifera* Michx. repeatedly spoken of in this paper.\n\n91. *Ricinus forte chinens*. *Tiliae folio*.\n\nThese leaves grow alternately on footstalks, some above 2 inches long, of the bigness of the Mulberry and Lime tree, but not serrated. At the top grow spikes of thrammy flowers, like the common *Palma Christi*, but closer set. I hope the next ship from Chusan will bring me it in fruit.\n\n92. *Thea chinensis vera potulenta*.

Gazoph. tab. 33, fig. 4. *Swa* Tea seu *Cha hoa* Chinens. Herb. nostr.

The Chinese and the Japanese keep them as an ornament in their gardens. The young flower bud is scaled like a cone. The fruit is about the bigness of a chestnut, somewhat triangular, including under a very thick woody shell several seeds disposed into 3 cells. It flowers in February.\n\nAccording to Linn\u00e6us Enc. Bot. I. 573, this is *Camellia japonica*. L. Petiver is the first botanist, who describes the plant.\n\n94. *Thymelea chusan*.

Plukenet.**\n\nAs has been stated above, Plukenet described in his *Amaltheum botanicum*, probably in 1703 and 1704, about 400 Chinese plants almost all it seems from Cunningham's collection. About 180 of them he represented by good drawings in his *Phytographia*, pars III. The plants in the Amaltheum are arranged alphabetically and the Chinese plants intermixed with Indian and American species and plants of the Cape. I shall extract in the following pages the diagnoses of all the Chinese plants of which engravings are found in the *Phytographia* and also of the greater part of those only described, omitting however in many cases the detailed descriptions. Plukenet generally quotes Cunningham's original descriptions. The pages quoted refer to the Amaltheum, the plates to the *Phytographia*, vol.

SWEDISH COLLECTORS OF PLANTS IN SOUTH-CHINA, 1751 AND 1766.\n\nThe greater part of the accounts presented in this chapter have been borrowed from a book, which bears the following title:\n\nA VOYAGE TO CHINA AND THE EAST INDIES BY PETER OSBECK\n\ntogether with\n\nA VOYAGE TO SURATTE BY OLOF TORREN\n\nand\n\nAN ACCOUNT OF THE CHINESE HUSBANDRY BY CAPTAIN CH. ECKEBREG.\n\ntranslated from the German by\n\nJOHN REINHOLD FORSTER.*\n\nto which are added\n\nA FLAVULA AND FLORA SINENSIS.\n\nLondon 1771. Two volumes.\n\nPETER OSBECK, a Swede and a pupil of the great Linnaeus, to whom the latter was indebted for the greater part of the Chinese plants and animals he has described\u2014was born in 1723. In 1750 he set out on a journey to China, as chaplain to a Swedish East Indiaman, the Prince Charles, which left Gothenburgh 18 Nov. 1750, and arrived at Cadiz 4 January 1751. After a stay of 10 weeks they left this place 20 March, sailed around the Cape, without landing there, in the second half of May. June 12 they passed St. Paul, on July 15 anchored in the harbour of Angeri (Java, Sundastr.), left again on the 17th. Here Osbeck was able to collect some plants. On the 25 Aug. 1751 the Prince Charles anchored at Whampoa (near Canton) and remained there more than four months, weighing anchor on the 5th Jan. 1752. On the way home Osbeck again collected Javanese plants and beasts in New Bay, where the Pr. Charles stopped a few days. In April O. made some collections on the island of Ascension and on the 26 June 1752 came back to Gothenburgh.\n\n* The well known naturalist and traveller, who accompanied Capt. Cook on his second circumnavigation of the globe 1772-75.\nOsbeck was a zealous naturalist and brought home a rich collection of natural objects, chiefly Chinese specimens, for during his long stay at Whampoa and Canton he had ample opportunity of visiting the neighborhood of these places. All his collections he placed in the hands of Linnaeus, who described them, the plants in his *Species plantarum*, published a year after Osbeck's return.\n\nOsbeck's original account of his voyage appeared in 1757 in his native language: *Dagbok \u00f6fver en ostindisk resa*. He published also some botanical articles in the Act. acad. Holm. 1762, 1765, and 1769. He was member of the Academy of Stockholm and of the Soc. of Upsal, and died as Rector of Hasloff and Woxtorp in 1805.\n\nA German translation of Osbeck's narrative was made in 1765 by J. G. Georgi, and revised and completed by Osbeck himself. Georgi* was Professor of Mineralogy at the Academy of St. Petersburg. He accompanied Pallas on his travels to Siberia and died 1802.\n\nThe English translation of Osbeck's book was made from the German by J. B. Forster, the well known companion in travel of Capt. Cook.\n\nAll the Chinese specimens gathered by Osbeck belong to the neighborhood of Canton. During his stay at Whampoa he repeatedly made excursions to Canton and investigated the Flora of the islands in the river. He often mentions Danes island, French island, only separated from the latter by a stream, and Honam (erroneously written Slonam in the narrative), an island west of the two first mentioned and on which a large suburb of Canton is situated. Not many of the botanists in Europe will be aware, I think, that Danes island on which Osbeck collected plants 130 years ago, has been for nearly 20 years the residence of one of the most distinguished botanists of our time, who has done so much to throw light on the Flora of China and whose name has a world-wide reputation. The numerous papers on botanical matters which have been published by Dr. H. F. Hance are generally dated from the British Consulate at Whampoa, which has been established on Danes island and not, as might be presumed, at the Chinese city of Whampoa, situated opposite the Consulate on the left bank of the river.\n\n* Willdenow named the genus *Georginae* (Dahlie) after him. Thus this favored gardenflower was not, as is erroneously believed by some authors, dedicated to King George III of England.\nOsbeck's notes on his plants collected near Canton are found scattered in his diary. He enumerates in the whole 244 Chinese plants, giving their Linn\u00e6an names, often describing them. Sometimes he adds also the Chinese names according to the Canton dialect, but generally he sadly perverts the Chinese sounds. He says himself (II. 10) that it is possible that the Chinese, who gave him these names, have imposed upon him on many occasions.\n\nLinnaeus, when determining Osbeck's Chinese collection seems to have been under the impression, that the habitats marked on the herbarium tickets, as Danes island, French island etc., referred to places of India, for in his Species plantarum, published 4 years before Osbeck's narrative appeared, all plants gathered by the latter, figure, with a few exceptions, as Indian plants only. But as we have seen O. never visited India. He collected a few plants on the coast of Java, but the bulk of his collection was represented by Chinese specimens. I may quote a few instances. In Linnaeus' Spec. plant. it is clearly stated, that Osbeck had gathered Rubus parvifolius, Cyperus Iria, Barleria cristata in India, whilst Osbeck had brought these plants from Canton. It seems that Linnaeus had a very confused idea with respect to the position of China and we cannot but think, that he considered the latter name to be a synonym for India. He describes many plants not known from elsewhere than from China as natives of India. Thus he states himself, that his Rosa indica and Lagerstroemia indica are Chinese plants. He describes his Daphne indica from specimens gathered by Osbeck at Canton, and this plant has, as far as I can conclude from the quotations in D. C. Prodr. XIV. 548, never been observed in India. On the other hand Sphaeranthus chinensis in his Spec. plant. figures as an Indian plant only. Compare D. C. Prodr. V. 371 \"cur chinensis cum ipse auctor ex India ortam dicat?\" It is strange to say that none of the botanists who after Linnaeus have compiled general systematic works on Botany, as Lamarck, Willdenow, Sprengel, De Candolle, Kunth etc., ever ventured to refer, with respect to Chinese plants directly to Osbeck's book. They draw from Linnaeus and mention Osbeck's Canton plants only in such cases for China, when the former had happened not to give India as habitat. But, as we shall see further on, by far the greatest part of the plants Linnaeus knew from China were collected by Osbeck near Canton.\n\nA considerable number of Osbeck's Chinese specimens were known previously from India (Rumphius, Rheedee), but were\nthen new for China and of many of them Linn. had hardly seen original specimens from India. There are in his collection about 50 (probably more) entirely new plants, 12 of which are represented by drawings in his book, viz:\n\nTab. 1 Baekia frutescens. Tab. 6 Trichomanes chinensis.\nTab. 2 Osbeckia chinensis. Tab. 7 Rhamnus lineatus.\nTab. 3 fig. 1 Pteris semipinnata. Tab. 8 Barleria cristata.\nfig. 2 Utricularia bifida. Tab. 9 Gerardia glutinosa.\nTab. 4 Pteris vittata. Tab. 10 Carpesium abrotanoides.\nTab. 5 Helicteres angustifolia. Tab. 11 Clerodendron fortunatum.\n\nBesides dried specimens of plants Osbeck had brought also from China many seeds from which Linnaeus succeeded in raising several new plants. It does not seem, that he had examined the whole of Osbeck's collection, for we meet in Osbeck's narrative some names and descriptions of Chinese plants not found in the Spec. Plant.\n\nLIST OF CHINESE PLANTS KNOWN TO LINNAEUS.\n\nForster in compiling his Flora sinensis, or Catalogue of Chinese plants (see above.) enumerates all Osbeck's specimens from China (244) and adds the names of 56 more Chinese plants known in 1771. In the following list I venture to present a more complete list of Linnaean Chinese plants (for Forster has overlooked many species) arranged according to Bentham and Hooker's Genera Plantarum. I always give their new names in the system, should the Linnaean name have been changed. The plants collected by Osbeck I mark with Obs. As in his narrative (Engl. transl.) the accounts of Chinese plants are found in the first volume from p. 208 to the end, and in the second from p. 1 to 17, I shall quote only the pages not the volumes.*\n\nDICOTYLEDONS.\n\n1.

July 1751 and left the 4. Janr. 1752. Toreen presented to Linn\u00e6us, his instructor, a collection of Indian plants, chiefly from Suratte, where he had made a stay\nof more than 5 months. It would seem that he gathered also some Chinese plants. I have already stated (see above Linn. Chin. plants. 172.) that Torenia asiatica, named by Linn\u00e6us after Toreen, was probably brought from China, not from India. In D. C. V. 543 I read under Pluchea (Cnysa) hirsuta: China (Torr. ex Linn.) I cannot now refer to Linn.'s original work in order to decide whether Toreen is quoted. Toreen died a year after his return to Sweden. Linn\u00e6us published the letters Toreen had addressed to him during his voyage. In his narrative there is nothing of interest concerning Chinese botany. He speaks of some cultivated plants and reports, that the Tea shrubs he took with him on his return, died, on the road, notwithstanding his care.\n\nThe third account of Swedish naturalists in China translated by Forster, is a Treatise on CHINESE HUSBANDRY by CHARLES GUST. ECKEBERG. Eckeborg was Captain of a Ship in the Swedish E. I. Comp.'s service. We know from Sparmann's brief account of his voyage to China, (see further on) that Eckeborg was Captain of the Navarcha and that this ship arrived at Canton Aug. 24. in 1766. It was at this place, that Eckeborg made his observations on Chinese husbandry, on which subject he subsequently published a very interesting account, of which I shall give an abstract. It seems that E. had previously visited Canton, about 1762.\n\nE. states that Rice is largely cultivated in the neighborhood of Canton. But he saw also Wheat there and Barley.\n\nHe mentions a coarse species of plant, with thin roots, whose leaves, flowers and seed capsules were like those of Radishes. These were sown in the beginning of Dec. In Febr. they were all in blossom, but in April the seed capsules turned yellow, and then the plants were plucked, dried, and the numerous seeds beaten out. From the seeds they press an oil, which they turn to many purposes in economy, but especially they burn it in lamps, and dress several dishes with it while it is fresh. The oil is so fat, that it cannot be used in painting, because it will not dry. The soot which comes from the lamps in which this oil is burnt is used in making the well known Indian ink.\n\nThe plant here alluded to is the Raphanus chinensis annuus oleifera, L. Raphanus sativus, var. oleifera. D. C. I. 228. It is stated in the Collect. acad. partie \u00e9trang. XI. 379 (quoted by Grosier, la Chine III. 294. I have not seen the original.) that the seeds of this plant, which the Chinese cultivate under the name of sui fa or sui fa tan, had been supplied\nby Eckeberg and sown in Sweden, where they produced a good crop. I am not prepared to say what Chinese name is intended by sui fa tan. Evidently it has been incorrectly rendered.\n\nIt seems to be the same plant, which Osbeck II. p. 29 mentions. 21. Dec. 1752. The high fields about Bocca Tigris (mouth of the Canton river) were green with a plant out of whose seeds the Chinese press the oil, which they call loam, and which is most probably Sesam.\n\nFortune (Wander. 55.) states, that the Cabbage oil plant of the Chinese in Chusan, Chekiang, Kiangsu is Brassica chinensis. L.\n\nCommonly the seeds of Cotton, which they call min foo succeed to those oily seeds. They are sown in April. Flowers appear in July, pods in August.\n\nThe Cotton plant, \u68c9\u82b1 min fa, in Canton.\n\nPotatoes, which they call fow ce make the third and last crop, which they plant after the cotton crop being over. These potatoes are different from ours. The roots have red peels, are longer, yellow, sweet, but the leaves are like those of European potatoes.\n\nE. means evidently Batatas edulis.

Chin. pl. 153.) sin: fow shi, but he is mistaken with respect to the leaves.\n\nSometimes the place of Cotton is supplied with lentils, beans Locktows and Calvanses.\n\nLentils is Phaseolus radiatus L.

Chin. pl. 254.)\n\nAfter this some particulars with respect to the cultivation of the Sugar cane by the Chinese are given.\n\nIn the kitchen gardens they cultivate Salade, long and short Cucumbers, Leeks, white Onions, Spinage, Celery, Carrots, Orach, a species of watery Turnips, long Radishes, Gourds, and Water melons. Of these they have procured the seeds from the Portuguese. Purslane grows wild. They keep a coarse sort of Water Spinage in ponds about \u00bd fathom deep, in which it grows so plentifully, that it quite covers the surface of the water. This is one of the most usual pot herbs.\n\nThis Water spinage seems to be Ipomoea reptans. Poir. See above Lin. Chin. pl. 158.\n\nAfter this E. speaks of the cultivation of Ginger and of Tobacco, yews of the Chinese.\n\nThey cultivate a plant, which they call fock yong, not unlike Niaq, but with paler leaves. They value this plant very highly and sell the pekul of it for 50 taels. It is said to be of great service in consumption.\nPerhaps \u690d\u7269 hok hong, which Lour. 441 thinks to be a Betonica. In Peking Lophantus rugosus. Fisch. is cultivated under this name.\n\nThe greater and the less Palma Christi (the less in particular Ricinus) is planted everywhere. The kernels being pressed afford a white clear oil.\n\nInstead of cabbage they use a plant with great coarse leaves like those of Burdock, all issuing out of a little root. The yellow flowers, the stalk with the pods, and the seeds themselves are like Cale. They daily use this plant and therefore it goes off so fast, that they immediately sow the void beds with it again. It grows very fast in all seasons. They boil and dry it and take it with them upon sea voyages.\n\nBesides this the Tartars of Peking have a species of White Cale with long, narrow heads, which is scarce in Canton.\n\nThe first mentioned is probably Sinapis brassicae. L. (Lin. Chin. pl. 10.) which is distinguished by its large leaves, the second Brassica chinensis. L. which does not form heads.\n\nEckeb. then enumerates the following fruits: Citrus decumana, sweet Oranges, which come to great perfection in Fukien, Amoy, little sour Citrons, Leicki, Longan, Mango trees, Olives, Pear-and Apple trees, and likewise Grapes.\n\nThe Betle bushes grow spontaneously without being planted.\n\nI may finally mention, that according to Linn\u00e6us Eckeberg was the first, who succeeded in bringing a living Tea shrub to Europe, which Linn. received 3. Oct. 1763.\n\nLindley Rosar. Monogr. 108 quotes Eckeberg in connection with Rosa temperflorens. Curt. China.\n\nSparrmann has dedicated to Eckeberg a new genus of plants, Eckebergia. (Meliaceae.)\n\nA small collection of S. Chinese plants was made by Andreas Sparrmann in 1766. A brief account of his voyage to China and his botanical investigations there is found in Linn\u00e6us' Amoenitates academ. vol.VII. 1769. p. 497\u2014506. Sparrmann, born 1747, a Swedish botanist and traveller, visited besides China also the Cape of G. H. (1771\u201472). He died 1787 and has written many botanical articles in the Act. acad. holm. and in Nov. act. soc. Upsal. Linn. fil. dedicated to him the genus Sparrmannia (Tiliaceae.) As to his voyage to China he states that Capt. Eckeberg had invited him to accompany him. Their ship, the Navarcha passed by Macao 24. Aug. 1766 and anchored not far from the city of Canton 26. Aug. Sparrmann enumerates the following plants gathered at that place:\nThea Bohea. Linn. Chin. pl. 16. Polygonum chinense. l. c. 212.\nIxora coccinea. l. c. 118. Torenia asiatica. l. c. 172.\nRhamnus lineatus. l. c. 48. Aralia chinensis, sed tota glabra.\nBaeckea frutescens. l. c. 85. l. c. 109.\nTriumfetta Barthramia l. c. 31.

Bromelia Ananas.\n\nIn my notice of the services rendered by Swedish naturalists with respect to the investigation of Chinese Botany, I ought not to omit mentioning the name of MAGNUS VON LAGERSTROEM, born in 1696. He was an ardent naturalist and a friend of the Great Linn\u00e6us. His position as Director of the Swedish East India Comp. at Gothenburg enabled him to procure many rare objects of natural history from India and China, which he used to present to Linn\u00e6us. He died in Gothenburg in 1759. Linn\u00e6us dedicated the genus Lagerstroemia to his friend. Toreen in his letters repeatedly speaks of Lagerstroem.\n\nThere is in Linn. Amoen. acad. IV. p. 230\u2014266 a paper by J. L. Odhelo, written in 1754, devoted to the Chinesia Lagerstroemiana. The author reports, that Lagerstroem had obtained from India not only dried specimens of plants, but had also succeeded in introducing living plants from those distant countries into the botanical garden of Upsala. He enumerates namely: Cocos, Phoenix, Cycas, Saccharum Pentapetes, various species of Hibiscus, Sanguis Draconis, Bambu, Conysa, Amarantus, Arum chinense (I do not know to what plant the last name refers. There is no Chinese Arum in Linn. Spec. Plant.)\n\nBesides this, Lagerstroem is stated to have been possessed of a Botanicon chinense, written in Chinese characters, in 36 volumes, of which 2 volumes contained engravings of plants, beasts, and minerals. (This was probably the well known Pen ts'uo k'ang mu.) Lagerstroem had moreover received from China a collection of about 1000 Chinese drugs.\n\nIV. EARLY RESEARCHES INTO THE FLORA OF PEKING.\n\nLet us return again to the Jesuit missionaries and continue to illustrate the services they have rendered in extending our knowledge of the vegetable products of China.\nWe have first to consider in this chapter the merits of Father Petrus d\u2019Incarville in having sent to Europe dried plants and seeds from North-China. He was a Frenchman born in 1706. In 1740 he joined the Chinese mission of the Jesuits and died in 1757 at Peking, where he seems to have labored during the whole period of his sojourn in China. D\u2019Incarville\u2019s name has been repeatedly inscribed in the annals of botanical science. From the seeds of various Peking plants procured by him a number of interesting new species, now-a-days much cultivated in Europe, have been raised. A. L. de Jussieu dedicated to him the genus Incarvillea represented by one species only, the *I. sinensis*, a beautiful Bignonaceous plant with large scarlet flowers, met frequently with in the Peking plain and in the mountains, towards the end of summer.\n\nBesides this, D\u2019Inc. transmitted to his instructor Bernhard de Jussieu in Paris a collection of dried Peking plants. I am not aware to what number of species this collection amounts. It has been incorporated with the herbarium of the Museum of Paris, but has never been worked up in any regular form. Only a few new plants of it have been occasionally selected for publication by French botanists, and, it is strange to say, from 30 to 80 years and more after the specimens were received in Paris. As far as I have been able to trace out from various botanical works, the name of Inc. is connected with the following Chinese plants, of which he has supplied dried specimens or seeds.\n\n1. *Allantus glandulosa*. Desf. Inc. first mentions this tree under the name of *Fr\u00e8ne puant* (stinking Ash.) in a memoir on Chinese wild silkworms, published a long time after his death by Cibot in the 2d vol. of the M\u00e9m. conc. les Chin. (1777.) p. 583. According to Loudon (Arb. et Frut.) seeds of this tree, sent by d\u2019Incarville, had been received in England in 1751. It was cultivated in France also, but described for the first time by Desfontaines only in 1786.\n\n2. *Cedrela sinensis*. Adr. Jussieu. Inc. mentions this tree in the above quoted memoir, p. 583, as *Fr\u00e8ne odorant*. From the dried specimens of it sent to Bernh. Jussieu in 1743, Adr. Jussieu described it for the first time in 1830.\n\n3. In the same memoir, p. 583, Inc. speaks of an *Oak* (of Shantung province it seems) which he means to be identical with *Quercus orientalis castanese folio, glande recondita in capula crassa et squamosa*, which he had seen cultivated in Paris and in Toulouse. Lamarck Enc. Bot. I 719, refers this\ndiagnosis (Tournef.) to a variety of *Quercus aegylops* L. of the Levant. But there can be no doubt that Incarville's Chestnut oak is the *Quercus chinensis*, Bge., very common in North-China.\n\n4. *Zanthoxylum Avicennae*, D. C. It was first described by Lamarck l. c. II. 445, in 1786, under the name of *Fagara Avicennae*, from a specimen sent by Incarville, probably from the province of Shantung. It seems this is his *Fagara* or Poivrier de Chine, the leaves of which are used to feed a kind of silkworm. (see the above mentioned memoir.)\n\n5. *Syringa villosa*, first described by Vahl 1805, from specimens gathered by Incarv. in the mountains of Peking.\n\n6. *Incarvillea sinensis*, described by A. L. Jussieu in 1789. Lam. l. c. III. 243.\n\n7. *Dicentra spectabilis* Miq. *Fumaria spectabilis*, L.\u2014Lam. l. c. II. 571, saw dried specimens of this plant sent by Incarv. in Jussieu's herbarium. (comp. also above Linn. Chin. pl. 4.)\n\n8. *Polygonum tinctorium*, Lour. Grosier (la Chine III. 276) reports that Inc. had sent to Paris seeds of the *Peking Indigo* (which is Pol. tinctorium.) accompanied with a memoir on the cultivation of the plant and directions for the extraction of its coloring matter. Jussieu cultivated the plant in the Royal Garden.\n\n9. *Callistephus chinensis*, Nees. *Aster chinensis*, L. Thouin (Diction. d'Agriculture l. 710.) states that seeds of the \"Reine Marguerite\" sent by Incarv. to Jussieu had been for the first time received in 1728. There seems to be some misapprehension. Seeds of the Chinese Aster or Reine Marguerite may have been sent by Incarville but not in 1728, for he arrived in China only in 1740. Dillenius describes the plant for the first time in his Hort. Eltham. 1732.\n\nThere is a strong probability that many other plants of North-China cultivated in European gardens and especially in Paris since the middle of the last century, were first raised from seeds sent by Incarville, although in botanical works his name does not appear in connection with the introduction of these plants. I may mention the following:\n\n10. *Koehreuteria paniculata*, Laxm. a tree hitherto observed in a wild state only in the neighborhood of Peking. Laxmann, a Russian botanist, described it first in 1772. Nov. Com. Acad. Petrop. XVI. He states that this shrub, the native\n\n---\n\n*I have not seen the original but quote from Grosier. l. c. III. 139.*\ncountry of which then was unknown, had been cultivated for 20 years in the hot-houses of the bot-garden of St. Petersb. It had first flowered in 1772. Lam. l.c. VI. 667 (1804) notices the K. paniculata as cultivated in Paris, but says nothing about its introduction. In England it was introduced in 1763. I am not aware what plant is intended by Sapindus Koelreuteria. Blanco. Fl. Philippin. 289.\n\n11. Zizyphus chinensis. Lam. l. c. III. 318 states, that this tree is cultivated in the Royal Garden, Paris, and that it is said to be a native of China. Z. chinensis, the same as Z. vulgaris. Lam is very common at Peking.\n\n12. Caragana Chamlagu. Lam. First described as Robinia Chamlagu by l' H\u00e9ritier, Stirpes novae, 1784. p. 161. Ex traditione in horto Parisiensi accepta gignitur in China camque dicunt Chamlagu ubi nomen vulgare Sinarum. I am not prepared to explain this name. C. Chamlagu is a common plant in the Peking mountains. It has also been gathered at Ningpo and Shanghai (Fortune, Forbes.)\n\n13. Gleditschia sinensis. Lam. l. c. II. 466 (1786) states: cultivated in the Royal garden, Paris; it is said to have been raised from seeds received from China. The tree is common in N. China.\n\n14. Vitex incisa. Lam. l. c. II. 612 (1786.) said to be a native of China, cultivated in the Royal garden, Paris. Miller (Fig. Gard. Dict. tab. 274.) states that seeds of this plant had been sent by missionaries from China to Paris. This shrub is very common at Peking and has been observed only in N. China, as far as I can conclude from the quotations in D. C. XI. 684. See above Linn. Chin. pl. 185.\n\n15. Lycium chinense. L. Miller in his Gard. Dict (1768) No. 6 states with respect to L. halimifolium (L. chinense) that Bernh. Jussieu, who had received the seeds of this plant from the missionaries in China, transmitted them to Miller. Lam. l. c. II. 509 says that L. chinense is cultivated since a long time in the Royal Garden.\n\nIt is generally believed that Sophora japonica. L. has been first introduced into our gardens by James Gordon in 1753 (See Acton Hort. Kew. III. 2). But in a letter which I lately received from Mr. J. Decaisne he kindly informs me that Sophora japonica was introduced into the Jardin des Plantes by d\u2019Incarville.\n\nDuring my last stay in St. Petersburg, in 1878, I fell in with a curious memoir by Incarville, an Alphabetical Catalogue of Peking Plants and other objects of natural history,\npublished in the Memoirs of the Soc. of Naturalists of Moscow, in 1812. (In French.) In an introductory note it is stated, that the original M. S. of this paper exists in the Archives of the Foreign Office at Moscow and had been communicated to the Society by Mr. Molinofaky, councillor of state. It seems that this catalogue had been drawn up by Incarville at the request of Bernh. Jussieu, his instructor. The Chinese characters accompanying the native names of plants, given in the M. S. have been omitted in the printing. Dr. Fischer, inspector of the botanical garden at Gorenki (subsequently Director of the Bot. Garden St. Petersburg) has supplied some scientific botanical names, for Incarville, besides the Chinese names, gives only old French popular appellations of plants. Even at the time when Incarville's paper was published the Flora of Peking had not yet been investigated by men of science and I venture to believe, that in the herbariums of the Botan. Garden and of the Academy in St. Petersburg, which now are so abundantly provided with plants from North-China, there was then hardly a specimen procured from Peking. Thus Fischer, in commenting on Incarville's accounts merely identifies the old French names of plants with the scientific Latin genus names. Incarville notices about 260 Peking plants or drugs, adds generally the Chinese names and occasionally some particulars regarding the economical uses of these plants. As I am tolerably well acquainted with the Flora of North-China and as I know also the popular names applied by the Chinese to the cultivated and some wild growing plants, I find no difficulty in ascertaining the plants mentioned by Incarville. But it would draw out my paper to an unconscionable length, were I to reproduce Incarville's enumeration and to comment on it.\n\nFrom some allusions in Incarville's memoir it can be inferred that he used to keep up a correspondence with some of the learned academicians in St. Petersburg. He refers to a letter Krasheninnikov had written to him about some seeds received from Peking. His collections destined for Jussieu, Inc. used to intrust to the care of the Russian caravans from Kiakhta (resp. Moscow) which every three years visited Peking. Jussieu seems to have forwarded European plants to Inc. by the same way, for in one instance the latter speaks of some bulbs and seeds sent by Jussieu in 1748, and of the delay in their transmission from Kiakhta by the Russian caravan.\n\nIn Koch's Dendrology, II. 307. I find a statement, that Adr. Jussieu after his death left a M. S. by Incarville, relating his\nvoyage to China, and a collection of 4010 Chinese drawings representing plants and animals, which then became the property of the Mus\u00e9um d'histoire naturelle. Anxious to see these documents I addressed myself personally to Mr. Decaisne, the eminent French botanist and director of that Museum. As they were found not to exist there M. Decaisne was kind enough to inquire about them at some other libraries in Paris, where he supposed they might have been deposited. But all inquiries proved unsuccessful. Koch has probably been mistaken, not, I believe, with respect to the real existence of such manuscripts and drawings, but evidently as to their fate after Jussieu's death.\n\nI go on now to illustrate the labours in the way of botanical researches of another Jesuit missionary of Peking, who followed Incarville's footsteps.\n\n**Pierre Martial Cibot** was born in 1727 in Limoges, in France. He came to China in 1759 (thus two years after Incarville's death,) and died in Peking in 1784. He was a prolific author and had a predilection for Botany. There are a considerable number of interesting observations from his pen, relating to Peking plants and their economic uses. All his papers have been printed in the *M\u00e9moires concernant les Chinois* etc., this vast repertory of the scientific labours of the Jesuit Missionaries at Peking in the second half of the 18th cent., issued in 16 vol. from 1776 to 1814. Cibot's articles are found in vol. II. (1777), III (1778), IV (1779), V (1780), VIII (1783), XI (1786). We are of course not to seek for scientific botanical names in Cibot's accounts. He confines himself to good popular descriptions and adds generally the names. The following is the list of the plants spoken of in Cibot's papers, with the modern botanical names and the Chinese characters added.\n\n1. On the *Chinese Cabbage* called *Pe tsai* and its culture. l. c. IV. 503.\n\n   *Brassica chinensis*. L. sin: \u767d\u83dc *pai ts'ai*.\n\n2. The *Lien kua* treated of in vol.

The *siao lan* from which in Peking a blue dye is obtained, a \"Persicaire,\" as Cibot correctly states, V. 499, is *Polygonum tinctorium*. Lour. sin: \u5c0f\u85cd sino lan.\n\n8. Various kinds of *Artemisia* used by the Chinese for preparing their moza and also a sort of tinder\n\n*Artemisia vulgaris* L. (*A. ignaria*, Maxim.) and *Tanacetum chinense*. A. Gray.\n\n9. On the cultivation of Cotton in China. II. 603.\n\n10. Tobacco in China. VIII. 267.\n\n11. The *Moutan* flower, III. 432, is *Paeonia Moutan* Sims. sin: \u7261\u4e39 mu tan.\n\n12.

L. sin: \u6728\u69ff mu kia.\n\n14. The *Pe ge hong*, III. 480, is *Lagerstroemia indica*. L. sin: \u767e\u65e5\u7d05 po ji hong.\n\n15. The *Ya lan*, III. 441, is *Magnolia Yulan*. Desf. sin: \u7389\u862d yu lan.\n\n16. Under the name of *Ye hsiang hua* Cibot gives a good description, III. 478, of *Periploca odoratissima*. Smith. Sin: \u591c\u9999\u82b1 ye hsiang hua.\n\n17. The *Mo li hua*, III. 446, is *Jasminum Sambac*. L. sin: \u6885\u82b1 mo li hua.\n\n18. The *Tseou hai tang*, III. 443, is *Begonia discolor*. R. Br. sin: \u79cb\u6d77\u68e0 ti'in hai tang.\n\n19. On the Peaches of Peking. XI. 280.\n\n20. On the Apricots of Peking, cultivated and wild. V. 505.\n\n21. On Chinese Chestnuts. III. 484. Cibot states, probably on the authority of ancient Chinese authors, that the Chinese graft the Chestnut tree upon the Walnut tree.\n\n22. Cibot asserts further, that the Chinese graft the Quince tree upon the Orange tree. III. 495.\n\n23. On Chinese Jujubes. III. 482.\n\n24. 25. The *Tchou tchuen* or *Fr\u00e8ne puan*, and the *Hiang tchuen* or *Fr\u00e8ne odorant*. II. 598. Cibot gives good descriptions of both trees. *Atlantus glandulosa*. sin: \u5965\u683c chou ch'un.\u2014*Cedrela sinensis*. Adr. Juss. sin: \u9999\u6a1f hiang ch'un.\n26.

III. 484.\n\n29. Cibot translates from Emperor Kanghi's memoirs an account of a barkless tree of Mongolia, called Tcha ke, furnishing an excellent fuel. IV. 460.\u2014This is the Halozylon ammodendron C. A. Mey, the dshak modo of the Mongols.\n\n30. The tree Lo ye song, a Fir tree with deciduous leaves, in South-Mongolia, IV. 454, is Larix dahurica Fisch. sin: \u843d\u8449\u677e.\n\n31. An interesting memoir on Chinese Bamboos is found II. 623.\n\n32. The mou chou kouo tse, a tree on which peculiar Galls are produced, XI. 294, is Celtis sinensis. Pers. sin: \u6728\u6a39\u679c\u5b50. mou shu kuo tse'.\n\n33. The Lin tchi, Agaric ramifi\u00e9, described in vol. IV. p. 500, with an engraving, is a Chinese Agario, termed \u7075\u829d ling chi in Peking, not yet examined by botanists.\n\n34. The Mo kou sin. IV. 500, accompanied with an engraving. This is the Clathrus mokusina Spreng. Phallus mokusina L. A more detailed article on this Fungus, has been published by Cibot in the M\u00e9moires de l'Acad\u00e9mie de St. P\u00e9tersb. IX (1774) The Chin. characters are \u8611\u83c7\u83cc mo ku sin.\n\n35. Finally I ought not to omit to mention a treatise written by Cibot on Chinese Hot-houses, in which he furnishes interesting details with respect to the primitive but practical mode of Peking gardeners to protect Southern plants in winter, and how they proceed to cause plants to put forth blossoms in winter. Vol. III. 423.\n\nFor the sake of completeness I may mention moreover in connection with papers on botanical matters two Jesuit missionaries of Peking, contemporaries of Cibot. One of them L. COLLAS, +1781, wrote an article on Chinese Bamboos, and another on the plants, flowers and trees of China, which could be cultivated in France. M\u00e9m. conc. Chin. XI. 553, 183.\n\nL. de Potrot, +1802, has written a paper on Chinese Worm wood (Artemisia). ibid. IX. 244.\n\nBefore quitting the subject dealt with in this chapter it may not be out of place to call the attention of the reader to a slight account of Northern Chinese fruits and vegetables found\nin PALLAS' notable work REISEN DURCH VERSCH. PROVINZEN DES RUSSISCHEN REICHES, 1768-1773. In the 3d. volume Pallas details some natural products sold in the streets of the Chinese market town Maimaicheng, opposite Kiakhta, which place he visited in 1772. Most of these fruits and vegetables, brought for the greater part from Peking, were completely unknown to him, but he describes them and adds the Chinese or Mongol names. As it may be presumed, that hardly any botanist, not acquainted with the native names of North-China and Mongol names of plants, would be able to ascertain what fruits are enumerated in Pallas' account, I venture to make some brief commentary on it.\n\nSmall green Peas, called lo dou, which Pallas correctly identifies with Phaseolus radiatus L. See above Linn. Chin. pl. 74.\n\nArbuses, Pears, Apples, called pinse and resembling green Rennet apples.\n\nWatermelons (Arbus in Russian) are cultivated in Transbaicalia, but no edible pears or apples are grown in Southern Siberia. \u860b\u679c in Peking is a small dark-red Apple.\n\nOblong Quinces, called mugha.\n\nCydonia sinensis. Thonin. Sin: \u679c\u5b50. The fruits of this are brought to Peking from the province of Shantung. They are oblong and often of enormous size.\n\nLemons, sweet and acid Oranges, Walnuts, Chestnuts, called lida.\n\nCastanea vesca \u679c\u5b50.\n\nSmall red Medlars, Mespilus fructu obtuse pentagono, ruberrimo. These are said to grow wild in North-China. The Chinese boil them with sugar and thus make a kind of Jam.\n\nAn excellent Jam is prepared in Peking from the fruit of Citrus pinnatipida Bge.\n\nThe fruit Alemo is the fruit of the tree Akash, an Apple tree of Southern-China.\n\nAlemo is the Mongol name for Apple. It seems that the other name is a corruption of \u68a8\u679c \u679c\u5b50, apple tree. \u679c\u5b50 at Peking is a small red-cheeked Apple.\n\nPallas saw also a most curious kind of Citron, splitting into 12 fingerlike divisions. It is devoid of pulp and seeds, but is very fragrant. The Chinese called it Fei shu.\n\nCitrus Citrocarpa. Lour. Fl. coch. 568. Sin: \u67d1\u6a58\u5b50, jiu chou.\n\nSmall fruit of a kind of Elaeagnus with a peculiar stone. The Bukhars call it debige, the Mongols sagis, the Chinese sausa.\nThe fruit Pallas saw was probably that of *Elaeagnus hortensis* M. B. var. *songarica* or the var. *orientalis*, (D. C. XIV. 609.) The Kirghises call the Elaeagnus fruit *dshigde*, the Chinese *sha tseo*.

SONNERAT.\n\nAbout a quarter of a century after Osbeck had herborized in the neighborhood of Canton, China was visited by a French naturalist, who gathered some plants at the same place it seems. *P. Sonnerat* was born in 1745 and spent a great part of his life, from 1768-1803, in travelling to different distant countries of the old and the new world. In 1768 he went to Isle de France, visited with Commerson Madagascar and Bourbon. From 1774 to 1781 he travelled to China and India, and settled finally at Pondicherry. In 1803 he returned to France with an immense collection. He died in 1814. Lamarck in his Enc. Botan. has described a great number of Sonnerat's specimens.\n\nThere is a work entitled: *Voyage aux Indes Orientales et \u00e0 la Chine 1774-1781 par M. Sonnerat, Commissaire de la marine, naturaliste du Roy*. 1782. 2 vol.\nAll that I can gather with respect to Sonnerat's voyage to China is on the title of this book. The text contains no allusion to his journey but consists of several articles on the countries he visited and the natural objects he collected there. It may be assumed however, that Canton was the place he visited in China. In the 2d volume p. 222-248 we find descriptions of plants with good engravings. Only 3 Chinese plants are there represented, viz:\n\n* Litchi chinensis. p. 230. tab. 129. *Nephelium Litchi*. Camb.\n* Coccinia punctata. p. 231. tab. 130. *Clausena Wampii*. Oliv.

I shall attempt presently to give an account of LOUREIRO'S FLORA COCHINCHINENSIS, a valuable monument of conscientious labour and considerable research. Although it deals properly, as the title intimates, with the Flora of Cochinchina, there are also described in it a considerable number of Chinese plants.\n\nLet me introduce the subject with a short biographical notice derived principally from the preface to the book, written by the author himself. I have also consulted Colmeiro's History of Botany in Spain and Portugal 1858. (in Spanish.)\n\nJoannis de Loureiro was a Portuguese. According to Colmeiro he was born in 1715 and proceeded in 1735 as a missionary to Cochinchina. But from Loureiro's own account we infer\nthat he arrived in Cochinchina about 1743, for he says that when in 1779 he established himself in Canton, he had spent 36 years in Cochinchina. As he states, p. 818, that in 1742 he was in Cambodia, we can therefore infer that he first lived in that country. It seems, that after his arrival in Cochinchina he had soon gained influence, for we find him holding an office at the Court of the King. (Rebus mathematicis ac physicis in Aula praefectus). Some knowledge of medical practice which he had previously acquired rendered him very popular among the people. He tells us that, European medicines not being within his reach, he was obliged to depend entirely on native drugs, and by investigating them he was necessarily induced to study the flora of the country and to make botanical collections. This was the origin of his herbarium. His collection of plants of Cochinchina (nearly 1000 species) seems to be confined for the greater part to a small area of the littoral region. He says, that his herbarium is far from being complete and may represent only about a quarter of the flora of Cochinchina. It had been impossible for him to procure plants from the distant forests. Only a few specimens had been obtained with great pains and not without danger from the (neighboring) forest-covered mountains. As at the time of Loureiro the capital of Cochinchina, where he lived, was at Hu\u00e9 (near the sea coast, about 17\u00b0 N.L.) it may be assumed, that the largest part of his Cochinchinese specimens were gathered in the neighborhood of that place. He generally does not specify the stations of the plants he collected in Cochinchina but confines himself to the statement that they are natives of that country. It is only in a few cases, which I shall notice here, that he refers to the stations.\n\nHu\u00e6, the metropolis of Cochinchina, is only once mentioned p. 129.\n\nThe port of Ho near Hu\u00e6, ibidem.\n\nThe rivulet Hon mo, not far from Hu\u00e6, p. 32.\n\nThe mountain of Ho chen opposite Hu\u00e6, p. 201.\n\nThe mountain of Con mit situated at a distance of 6 miles from Hu\u00e6, p. 753.\n\nThe port of Tuwan, called Han by the natives, south of Hu\u00e6, p. 208.\n\nProvince of Doung nai in the Southern part of Cochinchina, 10\u00b0 N.L. p. 109.\n\nProvince of Binh khang in the southern part of Cochinchina, 14\u00b0 N.L. belonging in former times to Champava. p. 154. 283.\n\nProvince of Quang binh in North-Cochinchina. p. 404.\nVia (province?) Nha ho in North-Cochinchina. p. 544.\nThe country of the Moji (tribe) in the west, p. 679.\nMountain Ngum nhung (Cochinchina) p. 646.\nSandhills of Son kowng (Cochinchina) p. 248. 547.\nRiver Lavus flowing between Cochinchins and Laos. p. 327.\n\nIn 1779 Loureiro proceeded to Canton, where he continued his botanical researches during three years. As at that time foreigners living in Canton were not allowed to walk beyond the limits of the factories, L. hired a Chinese peasant, acquainted to a certain degree with the medicinal plants of the country, to collect such for him. This Chinaman used to communicate also the native names of the plants he brought in the vernacular Cantonese dialect. But as the information thus derived seemed not always to be reliable, L. compared it with a Chinese book on Botany, in which he was able to find the correct names of the plants used for medical and economic purposes, and in his Flora cochinchinensis tried to spell these names according to the Mandarin dialect.\n\nLoureiro seems to have embarked with his botanical treasures in 1782. On his way home he visited the island of Mozambique, where he made a stay of three months, enriching his herbarium with many rare specimens. He states further, that during his peregrinations he had improved the opportunity by herborising in Cambodja, Champava, Bengal, Malabar, Sumatra. All the plants gathered in those regions he describes also in the Fl. cochin.\n\nAfter having reached his native country L. was taken up during several years, in Lisbon, with the preparation of his work for publication. In 1788 the M.S. of the Flora coch, written in Latin, and arranged according to the Linnaean system, was completed, but the book was not brought out before 1789. Three years later Willdenow edited it anew, adding some notes, which however throw little light on dubious questions and as he had no opportunity of referring to Loureiro's herbarium his identifications are not always happy.* In the following notes, quoting Loureiro, I always refer to Willd. edition.\n\nAccording to the Catal. Patr. Jea. Sin. Loureiro died in 1794. But Colmeiro makes him die two years later.\n\nThere is no allusion in L.'s preface to his having belonged to the Soc. of the Jesuits. On the title page he styles himself only: olim in Cochinchina Catholicae Fidei praeco. But in\n\n* On p. 458 he identifies Loureiro's Campsis adrepens with Incarvillea ejpsensis. But the former is Bignonia grandiflora -and bears no resem-\nblance to Incarvillea.\nthe Catalogus he is stated to have entered the Jesuit mission in China in 1779.\n\nLoureiro occupies without doubt one of the most prominent places among the botanical collectors of the last century. We owe to him one of the most important contributions illustrating the Flora of the eastern part of the transgangetic peninsula and of South-China, and his book is still a standard work to which botanists dealing with Chinese plants have frequently to refer. Although a self-taught and not professional botanist, L. had acquired good botanical knowledge, at least he was up to the level of his time. Modern botanists often find fault with his description of plants. But may we not ask whether it would be possible to identify even a quarter of Linn\u00e6us' plants only from the short characters he gives, had his herbarium been lost, as is the case with the greater part of Loureiro's collection. Thus Loureiro is not to be blamed for want of scientific accuracy in our modern sense or for mistakes occasionally met with in his work. Generally it can be said, that he was a conscientious observer and his veracity is always beyond question.\n\nOne great merit of the Flora cochin. consists in descriptions made by a botanist upon living or fresh plants. It is a matter of regret, that the greater part of the existing Floras of various exotic regions have necessarily been based upon the description of dried specimens and often unsatisfactory material. The botanist in Europe, who works up these collections then knows nothing more about the plants he has to describe than he observes on the dry specimens. Thus it is quite exceptional to find in De Candolle's Prodri. the colour of the blossoms noticed, although this is a very important characteristic.\n\nThe value of Loureiro's elaborate work lies also in the illustrations he gives with respect to the economical use, medical virtues etc. of the plants. The Chinese names he adds are for the greater part correct.*\n\n* I take the opportunity of noticing here a very valuable list of Canton plants with the Chinese names added, and accompanied with interesting annotations, published two years ago in the Hongkong China Mail, July 10 to Sept. 11, 1878. The anonymous author of this paper, which gives the Chinese, (Cantonese) names of nearly 300 plants, states, that in compiling this list he did not refer to any printed authority for the application of any one Cantonese name to any single botanical name. But every plant had been shown to at least three natives to ascertain the Chinese names and then referred to a competent botanical authority, to supply the scientific name. This is indeed the only rational way to identify Chinese appellations of plants. I have been informed, that Mr. R. H.\nnow in the Mandarin, now in the popular Canton dialect and makes sometimes mistakes in transliterating the characters.\n\nA considerable number of plants described by Loureiro, especially of Southern Chinese ones have been gathered by later collectors, who investigated the Floras of Canton, Macao or Hongkong. Loureiro's name occurs frequently in Hooker and Arnott, Botany of Capt. Becchey's voyage\u2014in Meyen's Observ. botan. in it. c. terram.\u2014in Bentham's Flora hongkongensis. Dr. Hance has also rediscovered many Loureirian specimens. But a great part of Loureiro's plants, in particular those from Cochinchina are still known only from his description, although they are probably very common in that country. It may be also that many Loureirian species relegated by botanists among the species dubiae are known under other scientific names. From the diagnoses alone given by L., without examining the original specimens, it is impossible to identify them.\n\nI may say finally a few words with respect to the fate of Loureiro's herbarium. From his preface we learn, that in 1774, when he was still in Cochinchina, he had sent by way of Canton to England and Sweden about 60 specimens of plants, accompanied with his own original descriptions, and that Berg in his Materia med. p. 5 and Linn\u00e6us fil. Suppl. p. 331, have noticed these plants. In 1779, when he was already established in Canton he transmitted to London 230 species more, which seemed to him to be novelties. This collection is now in the British Museum. As we can conclude from some references found in Benth. and Hook. Gen. Plant. those plants have been badly preserved and their examination is of little use for deciding dubious questions. According to Colmeiro the bulk of Loureiro's herbarium was\n\nParker of the British Cons. Serv. at Canton is the author of this paper, and I need hardly say, that the competent botanical author alluded to in it, is my respected friend Dr. H. F. Hance. I hope these gentlemen will pardon my having disclosed their names. The only faults I have to find with Mr. Parker's paper, are its publication in a Newspaper, where hardly any one interested in these questions would dream of looking for it, and the arrangement of the list in no intelligible order, scattered over 8 numbers of the China Mail with the interesting annotations generally not placed in the same number as the plants to which they refer. It would be worth reprinting in a form more accessible for reference.\u2014M. Parker is right in supposing that a great part of the Chinese names of plants, given by Dr. Williams (Bridgman's Chrestomathy) have been derived from Loureiro.\nkept by the Academy of Lisbon, but in 1808, when Napoleon I. had taken possession of Portugal a part of the herbarium was transferred to Paris, where it still exists in the Mus\u00e9um d'hist. nat. as Mr. Decaisne has kindly informed me. My late friend Mr. D. Hanbury gives the following account with respect to Loureiro's herbarium. (Science Papers 98) M. Pereira Da Costa of Lisbon had informed him, that the herbarium in question had never been at the Academy; it was supposed to have formerly belonged to the Museu da Ajuda; but upon the removal of that establishment to the Academy, no trace of it could be discovered.\n\nA great number of new plants have been described by Loureiro. Among the new Genera he has proposed, the following 30 have been ascertained and retained in Bentham and Hooker's (or Endlicher's) Genera Plantarum.\n\n| A\u00ebrides. | Dichroa. | Osmanthus. |\n|---------|----------|------------|\n| Aglaia. | Enhydra. | Phajus.    |\n| Argyreia. | Enkianthus. | Rhynchosia. |\n| Baccareae. | Fibraurea. | Salomonia. |\n| Blastus. | Grona. | Sarcodium. |\n| Bragantia. | Helicia. | Stephania. |\n| Centipeda. | Homonoia. | Streblus. |\n| Coleus. | Limacia. | Striga. |\n| Cyathula. | Mallotus. | Trema. |\n| Derris. | Masus. | Triphasia. |\n\nThe total number of plants described in Loureiro's Flora cochin. is 1257 of which 36 must be deducted as having been gathered in India, Sumatra, Mozambique. Of the remaining 1221 he enumerates 976 for Cochinchina and of these, 294 he had also gathered in China. As found only in China he mentions 245 spec. Thus the total number of Chinese plants observed by Lour. is 539. Of 341 of these China in general is given as habitat. With respect to the rest he indicates the habitat precisely, viz.\n\nCanton and Macao 193 plants.\nSouthern China in general 2.\nProvince of Yunnan 1. *Amomum medium.* p. 5.\nMountains of West-China 1. *Nardus indica.* p. 57.\nNorth-China 15 species. These plants or accounts of them had probably been sent to Loureiro from Peking by the Jesuits there (Incarville? Cibot?)\nDorstenia chinensis. p. 114.\nRhamnus soporifer. p. 196.\nRheum palmatum. p. 314.\nPyrus Malus. p. 393.\nPyrus Cydonia. p. 394.\nPotentilla fruticosa. p. 399.\nSinapis pekinensis. p. 485.\nGlycyrrhiza echinata. p. 543.\nRobinia flava. p. 556.\nCichorium Endivia. p. 583.\nArtemisia annua (Peking.) p. 599.\nTussilago Farfara. p. 614.\nTussilago Anandria. p. 614.\nPaeonia officinalis. p. 419.\nJuglans regia. p. 702.\n\nCHINESE PLANTS DESCRIBED IN LOUREIRO'S FLORA COCHINCHINENSIS.\n\nIn what follows I shall give a list of all the plants Loureiro mentions for China and include also those species which he had gathered only in Cochinchina but which subsequently have been observed also in China.\n\nI arrange the list according to the Natural System adopted by Bentham and Hooker, giving for each plant at first the Loureirian name, the habitat and the Chinese name as noticed by Loureiro, and quoting the page in the Flora cochin. After this I shall add, if necessary, my observations. Many of Loureiro's plants have by the progress of science received other names and mistakes made by that author have been occasionally corrected. In my researches with respect to Loureirian plants I depend upon De Candolle's Prodromus, Kunth's Enumeratio plantarum, Bentham and Hooker's Genera Plantarum, Bentham's Flora hongkongensis, the botanical papers published by Maximowics, Dr. Hance and others. I shall also give the Chinese names of plants noticed by Loureiro, as far as I have been able to ascertain them.\n\nWith respect to the abbreviations used in the following notes I beg to refer to my list of Chinese plants known to Linnaeus. When quoting Osbeck I always refer to that list not to Osbeck's Voyage.\n\nDICOTYLEDONS.\n\n1. Clematis minor. Lour. Canton. Sin: wei leng sien (\u5a01\u9748\u4ed9). 422.\n   Cl. terniflora. D. C.

BUC'HOZ.\n\nIn 1785 Abb\u00e9 Grosier published the first edition of his valuable *DESCRIPTION G\u00c9N\u00c9RALE DE LA CHINE* in one volume forming the 13th volume of Du Mailla's Histoire G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la Chine, edited also by the\nlearned Father Grosier, who was Biblioth\u00e9caire de Son Altesse Royale Monsieur, but had himself never visited China. A considerable part of his description of that Empire is devoted to Natural history, namely 106 pages to Botany. A new and much enlarged edition of the work he published from 1818 to 1820 in 7 volumes, nearly three of them treating of Natural history. Vol. II and III, 658 pages, deal with Botany. It supplies a mass of most valuable information with respect to Chinese plants, the vast material accumulated by the author having been principally derived from the accounts of the Jesuit missionaries found in the Lettres \u00e9difiantes, Du Halde, the M\u00e9moires conc. les Chinois etc. But Grosier draws also from many unpublished sources. He endeavours to give a list of the Chinese plants which since then had been described by professed botanists. But besides Loureiro's plants from Southern China, of which he generally gives a full account, his enumeration of Chinese specimens known to botanists is far from being complete.\n\nAlthough Grosier in reproducing all the observations of the missionaries concerning Chinese botany, seldom ventures to identify the plants described, his compilation is very useful and interesting, and I hope, that with the aid of the identifications and commentaries I have supplied in the preceding pages, almost all the statements of the Jesuits relating to Chinese plants will be understood by botanists.\n\nWe learn from Grosier that the Jesuit missionaries have introduced many Chinese plants into the Mauritius (Isle de France) and Bourbon, where they had also missions. Some of these plants were subsequently introduced from these islands into France. Thus *Briobotrya japonica* Lindl. had been brought from Canton to the Mauritius and from this place found its way to France, where in 1784 one specimen of the introduced shrubs blossomed. (Grosier II. 504.)\u2014*Lieistonia chinensis* Mart. a Chinese palm was for a long time known in Europe under the name of *Latania bourbonica* Lam.\u2014*Nephelium Litchi* was introduced at the end of the last cent. from China into the Mauritius and subsequently into Guyana. (Grosier II 478.)\u2014In Lamarck's Enc. Bot. many Chinese plants are noticed as cultivated in the Mauritius. I may quote *Euphoria longona* (*Nephelium longonum*) Lam. III. 574, *Cockia punctata* l. c. VIII. 327, *Driandra cordata* (*Blacococca vernicia*). l. c. II. 329. *Anona uncinata*. (*Artabotrys odoratissimus*) l. c. II. 127, *Lilaeae chinensis* (*Tetrathera laurifolia*). l. c. III. 574. *Dianthus chinensis*. L. cultivated in Europe since the begin-\nning of the last century has probably also been introduced by the missionaries. Tournefort, who first described this plant in the Memoirs of the Acad. of Paris, 1705, p. 264, under the name of Caryophyllus chinensis, states that Abb\u00e9 Bignon had received (seeds of) it from China about 3 years earlier.\n\nIt is merely for the sake of completeness in illustrating the botanical literature with respect to China, that I mention here two volumes of colored drawings of Chinese plants published by Buc'hoz, physician in ordinary to King Stanislas.\n\n1. Collection pr\u00e9cieuse et culmin\u00e9e des Fleurs qui se cultivent dans les jardins de la Chine. Paris 1776, in folio, 100 plates.\n\n2. Herbier ou Collection des Plantes m\u00e9dicinales de la Chine, d'apr\u00e8s un manuscrit peint et unique qui se trouve dans la biblioth\u00e8que de l'Empereur de la Chine. 100 plates.\n\nThese drawings with the Chinese names of the respective plants added (not in Chinese characters.) have been copied from some Chinese collection of pictures sent by the missionaries and have no claim to any botanical value. The medicinal plants especially are very badly represented. The other volume with ornamental plants shows more correct drawings.\n\nBuc'hoz was a very prolific botanical author. But his publications are not entitled to serious attention. Pritzel in his Thesaurus botanicus, after having enumerated B.'s works states:\n\nCatalogus noster partem solummodo parvam innumerabilium operum miserrimi compilatoris continet, in cujus ignominiam l'H\u00e9ratier Buchozian foetidum condidit et qui per semiseculum (1758\u20141807.) ultra 500 volumina consarcinavit.\n\nThe plant Pritzel alludes to is Serissa foetida. Comm. Buchozia coprosmoides. l'H\u00e9r. See above Loureiro's plants 278.\n\nWe have thus in the preceding pages endeavoured to give a general review of the early knowledge acquired by European naturalists into the flora of China, and have also successively enumerated all Chinese plants which have come under the notice of European botanists up to about the end of the last century. Although the materials for pursuing this line of investigation and for bringing the historical account up to the present day have been accumulated by the author, he must now take leave of the reader, not being in the position at present to work up a treatise which would probably occupy twice as many pages as the present essay.\n| Index |\n|-------|\n| Abies 56, 109. |\n| Abrus 146. |\n| Acacia 97,

W. BUSHELL, M.D.\n\nIn the first number of the Journal of the Society, published in June 1858, there is a paper by Mr. A. Wylie on the \"Coins of the Ta Ts'ing or Present Dynasty of China,\" which is excellent as far as it goes. Since its publication however so many additional varieties have been discovered that a collection of some of them may be useful to the numismatic student. Chinese authors generally neglect recent coins although the latest Ni Mu in his voluminous work the Ku chin ch'ien luo \u53e4\u4eca\u9322\u7565, published in 1877 in 36 books, commences with a series of the decrees and memorials relating to the coinage, with extracts from the official regulations on the subject, and devotes his 1st book to the money of the reigning dynasty concluding with the Chia ch'ing period. On the large coins of the Hsien feng period there is a separate brochure by Pao k'ang, the \u5927\u6cc9\u5716\u9304 Ta ch'uan t'ou lu published in 1876, which contains most accurate woodcuts of the specimens described, and gives also figures of the government silver and cash notes issued by the Board of Revenue during the same reign, with an appendix containing a series of letters on paper money.\n\nNearly all the figures in this paper are from fac-simile rubbings of coins in my own collection. I am indebted to the extensive collection of Mr. G. B. Glover for two or three not in my possession. I have figured only such as appear to be distinct varieties issued by the government mints. No special attention has been paid to different modes of writing the same Chinese character such as \u9686, \u9686, for the second character of \u4e7e\u9686 Ch'ien lung; \u5bf6, \u5bf6 for \u5bf6 pao &c. Still less have attempts been made to include every variation in the strokes\n\n* Read before the Society on the 7th June, 1880.\nof the Manchu characters which are often corrupt and due only to the ignorance of the illegal coiner.*\n\nNo. 1 was issued by the second emperor of the dynasty T'ai tsung who succeeded in 1627. The inscription is in the original pointless form of the Manchu character. The obverse read in the order\u2014left, top, bottom, right\u2014has Swra liam ai chika \"Money of the T'ien ts'ung period, corresponding to the Chinese, \u5929\u8074\u4e4b\u5bf6 T'ien ts'ung chik pao. The reverse has on the left chikou \"ten,\" on the right enu yun \"one liang,\" giving the value and weight of the coin.\u2020\n\nNos. 2-12 belong to the reign of Shih ts'ung (1644-1661), the first of the dynasty to rule over China, and have on the obverse Shun chih ts'ung pao \"Current coin of the Shun chih (period).\"\n\nNo. 2 has a ring on the reverse, above.\n\nNo. 3 has a dot above.\n\nNo. 4 has a dot on the left.\n\nNo. 5 has JI Hu above, indicating its issue from the JI Hu pu, the Board of Revenue.\n\nNo. 6 has above Hsian, for Hsian-fu in the province of Chih-li.\n\nNo. 7 has on the right JI Oh'san, for Ssu-ch'uan.\n\nNo. 8 has on the right WU, the meaning of which is doubtful.\n\nNo. 9 has on the left \u2014 Yi \"one.\"\n\n* Many of these are given in an article by Mr. J. Kirkwood in the China Review (Vol. VII. No. 3) to which I may refer those curious in such matters. Nos. 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77 for instance differ from coins figured by Mr. Wylie only, if at all, in the slightest variation in the form of the Manchu letters. No 4 in the same article is a typical example of the ingenuity of the Chinese variety-monger a common Shun-chih coin having been altered by the conversion of JI tung into JI shin and some of the strokes of the corresponding Manchu word chiselled away so as to form an illegible monstrosity. Two of the Chi liang coins are wrongly given as belonging to the Ch'ien lung reign and there are other errors in the brief descriptive notes. On the other hand several of the above coins were first figured in this paper and I owe to the author some exchanges of rare specimens.\n\n\u2020 For a full description of this coin see a note of mine in the China Review Vol. VI. p. 148. It was modelled after coins, with the same inscription in Chinese on the reverse, current during the Ming dynasty. A similar large coin of the Shun chih period is referred to in the Ku chih chih lin with Chinese inscription on the reverse, + chik above, \u2014 yi Kang on the right, but it is excessively rare and I have not even seen a figure of it.\nNo. 10 has Tung in Manchu and Chinese indicating the Shan-tung mint, and an additional character Kung below.\n\nNo. 11 has Fu in Manchu and Chinese and was issued in Fu-chien where a mint was founded in 1649.\n\nNo. 12 has Hsi in Manchu and Chinese and was probably cast in the Shansi mint.\n\nNo. 13 belongs to the reign of Sheng tsu (1662-1722). It has on the obverse Kang hsi tung pao, on the reverse Nan in Manchu and Chinese, for the Hu-nan mint, with a crescent above and dot or star below.\n\nNo. 14 is an additional coin of the reign of Shih tsung (1723-1735). It has on the obverse Yung cheng tung pao, on the reverse Pao hsin, a transcript of the name of the Ning-po mint.\n\nNos. 15-25 belong to the reign of Kao tsung (1736-1795), and have on the obverse Ch'ien lung tung pao, \"Current coin of the Ch'ien lung period.\"\n\nNo. 15 has on the reverse Pao tsu, the mint of Wu-ch'ang the provincial capital of Hu-pei, with a star below.\n\nNo. 16 the same inscription, with a star above.\n\nNo. 17 has on the reverse Pao t'ai, a transcript of having been issued from the mint of Tai-wan (Formosa).\n\nNo. 18 has on the reverse Pao i \"I-li mint,\" a transcript of the Chinese, and has a bar above. For this mint, as well as for the silver coinage of Tibet, the regulation was made in succeeding reigns that one fifth of the coins issued should have the inscription Ch'ien lung tung pao, in memory of the conquest of the country.\n\nNos. 19-24* are from the mints of Mohammedan cities of Chinese Turkestan, the names of which they have on the reverse in Manchu and Turki, the alphabet of the latter being derived from the Arabic, but so badly written on the coins as to be hardly decipherable. The coins are of reddish alloy being composed of 84 pts. of copper, 34.8 of lead, and 1.2 of tin, in 120 pts. The zinc which gives the yellow colour to the ordinary Chinese coins is not easily obtainable in these districts.\n\nNo. 19 has Aks on the left in Manchu, Aks on the right in Turki. The transcript in Chinese is \u963f\u514b\u8607.\n\n* No. 19 is figured by Mr. Wylie. Three of the others are also included by him but not from actual specimens.\nNo. 20 has Ushi on the left in Manchu, the Chinese form of which is \u9ce5\u4ec0; and Ush in Turki on the right.\n\nNo. 21 has on the left Yerkiyung in Manchu, the transcript of the Chinese \u8449\u723e\u514b\u5c24; Yarkand on the right in Turki.\n\nNo. 22 has on the left Yerkin in Manchu, the transcript of the Chinese \u8449\u723e\u5947\u6728; on the right Yarkand in Turki.\n\nNo. 23 has Kashgar on the left in Manchu and Kashgar on the right in Turki. The Chinese form is \u5580\u4ec0\u5676\u723e.\n\nNo. 24 has Hotiyan on the left in Manchu, the transcript of the Chinese \u548c\u95d0. The Turki form ought to be Khoten, the second syllable of which is legible on the coin.\n\nNo. 25 has on the reverse \u5b89\u5357 An-nan. It is a thin, badly cast coin and similar in aspect to the ordinary cash of Cochin-China. It is figured also in the Ku chin ch'ien luo and described as issued after the submission of \u962e\u5149\u5e73 Juan kuang ping.\n\nNos. 26-37 belong to the reign of \u4ec1\u5b97 Jen tsung (1796-1820) and have on the obverse Chia ch'ing tung pa o.\n\nNo. 26 has on the reverse Pao chiowan for \u5bf6\u6cc9 the Board of Revenue mint with a dot above.\n\nNo. 27 Pao yuan for \u5bf6\u6e90, the mint of the Board of Works, with a dot below.\n\nNo. 28 the same inscription with a ring below.\n\nNo. 29 Pao che for \u5bf6\u6d59 the Che-chiang mint, with a dot below.\n\nNo. 30 Pao k'iyan * for \u5bf6\u9ed4 the Kuei-chou mint, with a dot above.\n\nNo. 31 Pao u for \u5bf6\u6b66 the Wu-ch'ang mint.\n\nNo. 32 Pao chang for \u5bf6\u660c the Nan-ch'ang mint, with a dot above on the left.\n\nNo. 33 Pao yon for \u5bf6\u96f2 the Yun-nan mint, with a crescent above.\n\nNo. 34 Pao tai for \u5bf6\u81fa the T'ai-wan mint.\n\nNo. 35 Pao i for \u5bf6\u4f0a the I-li mint.\n\nNo. 36 has the same inscription with a perpendicular bar below.\n\nNo. 37 has Akus on the left in Manchu, on the right in Turki.\n\n* Mr. Wylie is wrong in referring the coins with this inscription to the Fu-chien mint, the second character of which would be transliterated in Manchu without an aspirate.\nNos. 38-56 belong to the reign of \u54b8\u4e30 Hsien tsung (1821-1850) and have on the obverse Tuo kuang tung pao.\n\nNo. 38 has on the reverse Pao ch'ioan for \u5bf6\u6cc9 the Board of Revenue mint, with a dot above.\n\nNo. 39 Pao chi for \u5bf6\u76f4 the Chih-li mint.\n\nNo. 40 Pao fu for \u5bf6\u798f the Fu-chien mint.\n\nNo. 41 Pao shan for \u5bf6\u965d the \u965d\u897f \"Shan-hsi\" mint.\n\nNo. 42 Pao k'ien for \u5bf6\u9ed4 the Kuei-chou mint, with a ring above.\n\nNo. 43 the same with a dot in the centre of the circle.\n\nNo. 44 the same inscription with a cross above.\n\nNo. 45 a cross below.\n\nNo. 46 a solid triangle in relief above.\n\nNo. 47 a similar triangle below with apex pointing downwards.\n\nNo. 48 a crescent above.\n\nNo. 49 has also Pao k'ien with \u5927 ta \"great\" above.\n\nNo. 50 Pao i for \u5bf6\u4f0a the I-li mint.\n\nNo. 51 the same inscription with a dot above.\n\nNo. 52 the same with a vertical bar above.\n\nNo. 53 is a larger coin from the I-li mint, with the character \u5341 shih \"ten\" above, indicating its value to be equal to ten of the common small cash.\n\nNo. 54 has Akts on the left in Manchu, on the right in Turki.\n\nNo. 55 the same inscription with \u516b\u5e74 pu nien \"eighth year\" (1828) above, and \u4e94 ren \"five\" below, to mark the value.\n\nNo. 56 like the last with \u5341 shih 10 instead of 5. These two coins were issued after the recovery of the Mohammedan cities which had revolted from the Chinese rule, and the capture of Jehangir (\u5f35\u683c\u723e), the descendant of the old Khoja rulers who took the title of Sultan in Kashgar in 1826 and was afterwards brought to Peking and beheaded.\n\nThe coins issued during the reign of \u6587\u5b97 Wen tsung (1851-1861), the title of whose reign was \u54b8\u8c50 Hsien feng, are much more numerous. On account of the rebellion in the central provinces the supply of copper which is mainly derived from Yunnan was cut off, and the government was reduced to great straits. In 1853 Chi Ch\u00fcn-tso the minister in charge of the Board of Revenue memorialized to advise the issue of large coins equal to ten of the ordinary small cash. Then iron furnaces were founded and large quantities of iron coins\nthrown into circulation. Soon after large coins of the nominal value of 50 and 100 were cast. These were so successful that the princes and high officials of the Council constituted to put down the rebellion recommended the issue of larger tokens each one representing 500 and 1000 units, and these circulated together with the rest and a new currency of iron and zinc small cash.\n\nAt first both officials and common people are said to have united in praise of the convenience of these large coins, but the large margin of profit tempted false coiners who swarmed like bees, and though executed in crowds, others took their place, including even the Buddhist monks. The result was a rapid depreciation of the large coins and finally nobody would take them at any price. Only those of the nominal value of 10 remained in circulation and these still constitute the actual currency of the capital. Their value however has sunk to that of two of the small cash and a tael of silver exchanges for about eight hundred.\n\nThe iron money held its ground till 1857 during the first Chinese month of which year there was a popular rising in Peking and it became, at one bound, so much worthless metal. Some of the provincial mints issued iron and zinc coins which had a yet shorter life.\n\nAt the time of the issue of the large tokens in the capital orders were sent to the provincial governors to have similar coins made in the various mints, after models which were distributed by the Board of Revenue. In some of the mints the coins were cast but never circulated; in others they circulated for a short time and were then withdrawn; in the rest the receipt of the models was acknowledged, and some pattern coins were duly forwarded for the inspection of the emperor, but no mint was opened.\n\nThere are altogether so many varieties that a collection in tabular form of the specimens figured here, together with the fifteen included in Mr. Wylie's article, may be useful, if only as a basis for future discovery and addition.\n| Province | Mint Mark | Denomination | Quantity |\n|----------|-----------|--------------|----------|\n|          |           |              |          |\n|          |           |              |          |\n|          |           |              |          |\n|          |           |              |          |\n|          |           |              |          |\n|          |           |              |          |\n|          |           |              |          |\n|          |           |              |          |\n|          |           |              |          |\n|          |           |              |          |\n\n**TABLE OF HSIEH-FENG (COPPER) AND I (IRON) COINS**\n\n**COINS OF THE PRESENT DYNASTY OF CHINA.**\nNos. 57-61 are from the Board of Revenue and have the name of the mint in Manchu pao ch'owan, the transcript of \u5bf6\u6cc9, on the reverse.\n\nNo. 57 has on the obverse Hsien feng chung pao \"Heavy coin of the Hsien feng period\", on the reverse \u7576\u4e94\u6587 indicating its value to be 5.\n\nNo. 58 reverse \u62fe\u6587 shih wen \"ten cash.\" This and the preceding are rare.\n\nNo. 59 is the ordinary Board of Revenue coin, having on the reverse tang shih, \"equivalent to 10.\" Both copper and iron.\n\nNo. 60 has on the obverse Hsien feng yuan pao \"Large coin of Hsien feng\", on the reverse tang erh pai \"equal to 200\".\n\nNo. 61 the same obverse, reverse tang wu pai \"equal to 500\".\n\nNo. 62 the same obverse, reverse tang ch'ien \"equal to 1000\".\n\nNos. 63-67 have similar inscriptions to the above from which they are distinguished by the addition of a crescent and dot or star on the reverse, to show that they were cast and presented to the emperor by the Hereditary Prince of K'o-ch'in \u514b\u52e4\u90e1\u738b.\n\nNos. 68-70 are from the Board of Works and have the mint on the reverse in Manchu pao yuwan, from the Chinese \u5bf6\u6e90.\n\nNo. 68 reverse tang shih \"equal to 10\" exists also in iron.\n\nNo. 69 reverse tang wu pai \"equal to 500.\"\n\nNo. 70 reverse tang ch'ien \"equal to 1000\".\n\nNos. 71-74 belong to Chih-li and were issued from Pao-ting-fu, the provincial capital.

This city was taken by the Taiping insurgents before the issue of the large coins which were struck for this province at a new mint founded at Ch'ang-t\u00ea-fu (Figs. 105-108).\n\nNos. 162-164 are from the Ili mint, having on the reverse in Manchu pao i, the transcript of \u5bf6\u4f0a.\n\nNo. 162 has on the obverse Hsien feng t'ung pao, and is the unit of the currency.\n\nNo. 163 obverse Hsien feng chung pao, reverse tang wu shih \"equal to 50\".\n\nNo. 164 obverse Hsien feng yuan pao, reverse tang pai \"equal to 100\".\n\nNos. 165-169 are from the Aksu mint and have the name of the city on the reverse\u2014on the left in Manchu, on the right in Turki which is written with the Arabic alphabet.\n\nNo. 165 represents the unit.\n\nNo. 166 has on the obverse Hsien feng t'ung pao, on the reverse tang wu \"equal to 5\".\n\nNo. 167 a similar obverse with tang shih, \"equal to 10\", on the reverse. A Chinese numismatist, with characteristic-\nally minute analysis, notes that the character is unusually broad and sprawling, proving that the old Tao kuang moulds were used, the characters being obliterated (see Nos. 55, 56) and replaced with a separate stamp.\n\nNo. 168 obverse Hsien feng chung pao, reverse tang wu shih \"equal to 50\".\n\nNo. 169 obverse Hsien feng yuan pao, reverse tang pai, \"equal to 100\".\n\nNos. 170, 171 are from the Yarkand mint and have the name of the city on the reverse, on the left in Manchu\u2014Yerkiyang\u2014on the right in Turki\u2014Yarkand.\n\nNo. 170 obverse Hsien feng tung pao, reverse tang shih \"equal to 10\".\n\nNo. 171 obverse Hsien feng yuan pao, reverse tang pai, \"equal to 100\".\n\nNo. 172 is figured here from its similarity in style of inscription and alloy to the coins of Chinese Turkestan. It has on the obverse Hsien feng tung pao, on the reverse tang wu \"equal to 5\", and two other characters which would appear to be Manchu and Turki but are so badly written as to be undecipherable.\n\nNos. 173-203 belong to the reign of Mu tsung (1862-1874). After the death of his father on August 22nd 1861 at Jeho (Jehol), the new emperor succeeded and Chi hsiang \"Good Luck\" was chosen for the name of the epoch, the first year of which would have been 1862. After the return to Peking however there was a coup d'\u00e9tat, the Council of eight appointed by the late Emperor were degraded and the principal members executed, and Prince Kung, in conjunction with the two Empresses Dowager, became Regent. The nien hao was then changed to T'ung chih \"Union in order\". Money had already been cast in the metropolitan mints but it had not yet been issued, so that the cash were re-melted, a few only being kept as curiosities. They are figured here.\n\nNo. 173 has on the obverse Chi hsiang chung pao \"Heavy money of the Chi hsiang period\", on the reverse tang shih \"equal to 10\" with the name of the Board of Revenue Mint in Manchu pao ch'\u00fcan.\n\nNo. 174 a similar inscription with pao yuen in Manchu for the Board of Works Mint on the reverse.\n\nNos. 175-176 with the inscription Chi hsiang tung pao \"Current money of the Chi hsiang period\" belong to the unit currency of the same two mints.\n\nNo. 177 has on the obverse T'ung chih tung pao, on the reverse pao ch'\u00fcan for the Board of Revenue Mint.\nNo. 178 on the reverse pao yuan, for the Board of Works.\nNo. 179 pao chi for the Chih-li mint.\nNo. 180 pao su for the Chiang-su mint.\nNo. 181 pao che for the Ch\u00ea-chiang mint.\nNo. 182 pao ch'ang for the Chiang-si mint.\n\nNos. 183-186 have pao fu* for the Fu-chien mint.

The numbers are generally calculated for ordinary years and would be proportionally greater when there is an intercalary month. This work may be referred to for details concerning the alloy, the source of the metal used &c. The general weight of each cash is directed to be 1-2 ch'ien. A number of heavier coins weighing 1-6 ch'ien are cast before the new year for distribution among the guards and eunuchs of the palace, made of pure brass composed of 60 per cent of copper and 40 per cent of zinc; these are called kua ieng ch'ien \"lamp hanging money\", in popular slang huang kai-tsu \"yellow covers\". The percentage of the ordinary money ought to be 54 of copper, 42-75 of zinc, 3-25 of lead. In the provinces where the copper is of inferior quality no lead must be used, its place being supplied with zinc. In Ili where there is no zinc there are in 12 parts, 8-4 of copper, 3-48 of lead and 0-12 of tin.\n\nWith regard to the form etc. at the beginning of each reign, models are carved in ivory and presented to the superintendent of the central mint. If approved these are copied with the chisel in pure copper, and the copper models are used to impress the first moulds in which the \"mu ch'ien\" are produced. These \"mother coins\" are distributed to the various mints, and the provincial authorities have to cast from them a number of \"yang ch'ien\" \"pattern coins\" and forward them to the Emperor for approval.\n\nNos. 197-203 comprise large coins which have survived from the token-issue of the previous reign, and all have the inscription T'ung chih chung pao, with the exception of the Yarkand specimen which has tung pao.\n\nNo. 197 has on the reverse Tang shih \"equal to 10\" and is from the Hu pu mint.\n\nNo. 198 belongs to the Kung pu mint.\n\nNo. 199 with tang wu \"equal to 5\" and No 200 tang shih \"equal to 10\" are from the Kung-ch'ang-fu mint in Kan-su.\n\nNo. 201 with the inscription Akst in Manchu and Turki is a large well-cast specimen and has the appearance of a model coin.\n\nNo. 202 with tang shih \"equal to 10\" has Yerbiong in Manchu, Yarkand in Turki.\n\nNo. 203 is an anomalous coin extracted from the Taoh'ien ton lu with pao; for the Ili mint and tang ss\u00fc \"equal to 4\" on the reverse.\nNos. 204-207 belong to the present Emperor the title of whose reign is Kuang hsi \"Brilliant succession\" beginning in 1875. They are specimens of the large and small coinage of the two metropolitan mints.\n\nNos. 208-211 are examples of medals cast in the government mint.\n\nNo. 208 has on the obverse Kang hsi chang pao \"Heavy coin of the period Kang hsi\" (1662-1722): on the reverse a dragon and phoenix with two medallions containing the characters pao ch'ien, the name of the mint. A similar medal contains two dragons on the reverse. These are said to have been cast in obedience to a special decree for imperial presents. Dragon and phoenix medals were cast during the three succeeding reigns but not for imperial use and the execution is much inferior.\n\nNo. 209 has on the obverse Tao kuang tung pao, on the reverse Tien hsia tai ping. \"Peace throughout the empire\". Coins with this and other felicitous sentences, such as \u9577\u751f \u5bcc\u8cb4\u9577\u660e\u798f\u6c23 \"long life, happiness and rank\", are cast at the new year and presented with the \"lamp-money\" for palace use, and are said to be attached to the corners of wrappers &c. No. 210 with Yi tung tien hsia \"The empire under one rule\" is a similar medal of the reign Hsien feng.\n\nNo. 211 is a medal with the inscription T'ung chih tung pao, and on the reverse figures of the eight diagrams. Whenever a new hall is built in the palace, a pao ho \"precious box\" is put upon the main beam with these \"pa kua\" medals inside and built into the roof. The box contains in addition current coins of the period, precious stones, the five kinds of metal, the five sorts of grain and silk of different colours. Placing this box under the roof is another instance of the curious contraristy of Chinese customs compared with those of the west.\n\nNos. 212, 213 are examples of charms, each one taken from a series, which are sometimes confounded with circulating coins of the same period. It is a common superstition that a set of twenty Kang hsi coins, strung together so that the names of the mints on the reverse can be read as a kind of verse, are an efficient protection, if carried by the traveller, against disaster by sea or land.

It has on the obverse Hung hwa tung pao, on the reverse, on the right, kung for the Board of Works.\n\nNos. 251-253 belong to another rebel coinage of the beginning of the reigning Manchu dynasty and were issued by Keng Ching chung who headed an insurrection in Fu-chien and Kuang-tung which was put down in two years.\n\nNo. 251 has on the obverse Y\u00fc min tung pao, on the reverse, on the right, tung.\n\nNo. 252 a large well cast coin with the same inscription on the obverse, has yi ch'ien on the reverse for the silver-value, shewing that ten were equivalent to one tael.\n\nNo. 253 a similar coin with yi ch'ien on the left of the reverse, ch\u00ea for the province of Ch\u00ea-chiang on the right. \u2020\n\nNos. 254-258 belong to the coinage of the Taiping rebels.

I have never seen an actual specimen like it.\n\n\u2020 Another coin of this mint is mentioned with \u4e8c\u5206\u56dbch'\u00ean on the reverse.\n\n\u2021 Silver coins of different denominations were issued by the Taiping rebels with the legend Tien kuo sh\u00eang pao \"Sacred coin of the Celestial State\". The official silver coinage of Tibet instituted in 1728 is also not included in this paper, having been figured and described in the \"China Review\" Vol. VI. p. 349. I have heard of silver coins issued recently by Tso Tsung-t'ang in Kansu but have not seen a specimen.\nNo. 259 is a specimen which appears to belong to a recent rebel coinage. It has on the obverse Huang ti tung pao \"Circulating coin of the Huang ti (Emperor)\", on the reverse pao ch\u00e9 the name of the Ch\u00ea-chiang mint.\n\nIn the third year of Hsien feng (1853), when the large copper tokens were coined, the government paper currency of preceding dynasties was also revived. The notes of two kinds, cash-notes and silver notes, were issued by the Board of Revenue and forced into circulation by paying part of the salary of officials in the new currency and by compelling the banks and large pawnbroking establishments to accept it in lieu of more solid money. The value of these notes however depreciated rapidly until in 1861 they were sold by Dutch auction in the streets of the capital at a discount of 97 per cent (see Dr Rennie's Peking and the Pekingesse). Soon after this they disappeared altogether from circulation.\n\nThe cash-notes are of four denominations equivalent to 500, 1000, 1500, and * 2000 cash respectively. They are printed from wood-blocks with blue ink on thick whitish paper. The specimen figured is of the value of 1000 cash. It is headed Ta ch'ing pao ch'ao \"Money note of the great Ch'ing (dynasty)\". The ornamental border has above two dragons striving for a pearl, below the fabulous mountain of precious stones with coral-trees in the midst of sea waves, and at the sides clouds interrupted by medallions containing, on the right the character T'ien hsia tung hsing \"To circulate throughout the empire,\" on the left Ch\u00fcn ping ch'u ju \"Issued and accepted at equal value.\" Within the border are three lines; the central specifying the value \"Equivalent without deduction to 1000 pieces of government cash\"; the right the number 426 in black, partly stamped partly written, classified under the character pien (one of the words of the thousand character classic used numeratively); the left the date \"Made in the seventh year of Hsien feng (1857)\", the number of the year stamped in blue with a separate stamp. Below these is printed: \"These \"notes shall circulate in place of government cash and will be \"received in the proportion fixed for the different taxes, for \"all the customs dues, and for the purchase of rank. The \"treasuries both of the capital and provinces shall alike accept \"and forward them. The cash-notes shall be exchangeable \"for government silver-notes in the proportion of 2000 cash\n\n* There is an excellent illustration of a 2000 cash note dated 1859 in Col. Yale's Marco Polo (Vol. I. p. 384).\n\"for one tael of silver.\" The large square vermilion seal in the centre is that of the Revenue Board in Manchu and Chinese, Tu ching pao chih yin. The small oblong seal in black under the date is that of the official in charge put on when the number is written. There is also at the side a round seal (differing in design in different notes) and blotched lines made with a brush before the note has been cut from the tally.\n\nThe silver notes are printed on fine Korean paper, also from wooden blocks, in blue. I have examples of 1, 3, 5, 10 and 50 taels and figure the first. The ornamental border has five dragons traversing clouds in the direction of a pearl emitting rays of brilliance like flames, and waves of the sea below with precious emblems floating upon them. Within this border there is at the top an oblong frame containing, in Manchu Poilun ni churhan ni ulpan tomkot'nu, in Chinese Hu pu kuan piao \"Government note of the Board of Revenue.\" The central line has \"Equivalent by the two tael scale to one tael of pure silver\", the number impressed in black with a large stamp. On the right \"Number 29643 of the numeral kung\", the first character stamped in black, the number written. On the left the date \"Hsien feng 3rd year (1853), 11th month, 9th day\", the year and month printed in black by separate stamps, the day in manuscript. There is printed below: \"The Board of Revenue has memorialized to recommend the circulation of government notes. All shall willingly take these government notes in exchange for silver and for copper money, and they shall be equivalent in all cases to silver. In accordance with the regulations fixed by the Board, they shall be accepted in definite proportion in payment of government dues. Those who counterfeit them shall be punished according to the statutes and shall not be pardoned.\" Outside the border on the left near the top is printed \"Each tael is 6 per cent less than that of the treasury scale.\" There are two vermilion seals with inscription in Manchu and Chinese, the small square one in the centre being Hu pu kuan piao yung yuan tsung hsing \"The Board of Revenue government note for everlasting circulation.\" The large oblong one on the edge Hu pu kuan piao so kuan fang \"The official seal of the Board of Revenue government note office.\" The third large square crimson seal on the right edge with the Chinese inscription Hu pu chih yin \"Seal of the Board of Revenue\" indicates that the note is for provincial circulation. The figure below to the left is the private signature impressed when the number is written.\nARTICLE III.\n\nTHE \"NATURALISTIC\" PHILOSOPHY OF CHINA.*\n\nBY FREDERIC H. BALFOUR. F.R.G.S.\n\nIT occasionally happens that a sudden ray of clear and valuable light is thrown upon a long-disputed subject from a source the very existence of which was unsuspected, and the authority of which would certainly never have been allowed. Just as an accident may reveal what generations of scientific men have laboured in vain to discover: just as a rank outsider may win a race, or the dart, shot at a venture, hit the bull's-eye when trained archers have discharged a quiver-full of arrows without success,\u2014so may some happy and spontaneous phrase, falling from one who approaches a topic of interest or difficulty for the first time, fresh and unencumbered by preconceptions or the dissertations of experts, embody in itself the kernel of the enigma, and make the whole thing promptly and forever plain. And such a service has, I think, been lately rendered to the cause of philosophical research in China. An able American writer, whose recent work on \"Oriental Religions\" is, or ought to be, on the shelf of every reading man, gives to the Confucian school, for the first time, its true designation of Rationalist. Confucius was a Rationalist in every sense; his followers are Rationalists; his philosophy was altogether Rationalistic in its scope. The word is just the one we wanted, but which we never found; and its universal acceptation, from henceforth, can be only a matter of time. It is not only for supplying us with a just descriptive epithet for the orthodox philosophy of China, however, that we are indebted to Mr. Johnson. As soon as ever the term Rationalism is recognised as belonging to the system of Confucius, it will fall into deserved desuetude in that sphere where hitherto it has usurped another's right. No word could, in my opinion, be more inappropriate, or more unhappily selected, as applied\u2014\n\n* Read before the Society on the 21st September, 1880.\nto the philosophy of Lao Tze. That the character Tao \u9053 may be properly translated \"reason\" in certain instances, I do not deny. That it is an apt equivalent for \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 in the Johannine sense of the word appears generally allowed. For the rendering of it by \"way\" there are both etymological and philosophical recommendations which may not be overlooked. But that none of these is the true and actual meaning of the word in its esoteric sense I hope to show in the present paper; submitting, at the outset, that no fitter illustration could be offered of the fatality attending servile adherence to a literal system of translation than the rendering, hitherto in force, of Reason. The letter killeth; and in the present instance it has killed all sense and meaning out of the word it was attempting to explain.\n\nThe position we take up, therefore, is a very simple one. To put it algebraically, Tao is the x, or unknown quantity that we have to find. And the first thing to be done is to see what is predicated of this mysterious Thing; how it is described; with what attributes it is credited; where it is to be found; whence it sprang, how it exists, and what its functions are. Then we may find ourselves in a position to discover what it is that answers to these particulars, and profanely to give a name to that which its preachers themselves declared must be forever nameless.\n\nWe are told that it existed before the time which had no beginning had begun. Chuang Tze says that there never was an epoch when it was not. Lao Tze affirms that it existed before God Himself. It is all-pervasive; there is nowhere where it is not found. It fills the Universe with its grandeur and sublimity; yet it is so subtle that it exists in all its plenitude in the tip of an autumn hair. It causes the sun and moon to revolve in their appointed orbits, and gives life to the most microscopic insect. Formless, it is the source of every form we see; inaudible, it is the source of all the sounds we hear; invisible, it is that which lies behind every external object in the world; inactive, it produces, sustains, and regulates every phenomenon which exists in all the spheres of being. It is impersonal, passionless; working out its appointed ends with the remorselessness of Fate, yet overflowing in benevolence to all. \"What is Tao?\" exclaims Huai-nan Tze. \"It is that which supports Heaven and covers Earth; it has no boundaries, no limits; its height cannot be measured, nor its depth fathomed; it enfolds the Universe in its embrace, and confers visibility upon that which of itself is formless ....\nIt fills all within the Four Points of the Compass; it contains the Yin and Yang; it holds together the Universe and Ages, and supplies the Three Luminaries with light. It is so tenuous and subtle that it pervades everything just as water pervades mire. It is by Tao that mountains are high and abysses deep; that beasts walk and birds fly; that the sun and moon are bright, and the stars revolve in their courses. ...When the spring-winds blow, the sweet rain falls, and all things live and grow. The feathered ones brood and hatch, the furry ones breed and bear; plants and trees put forth all their glorious exuberance of foliage, birds lay eggs, and animals produce their offspring; no action is visible outwardly, and yet the work is completed. ...Shadowy and indistinct! it has no form. Indistinct and shadowy! its resources have no end. Hidden and obscure! it reinforces all things out of formlessness. Penetrating and permeating everything! it never acts in vain\".\n\nSuch are a few of the attributes ascribed to the nameless principle we are considering. What ideas do they suggest to our mind?\u2014Such, I believe, as cannot be expressed in a single word. Lao Tze and his successors recognised the fact that for this mysterious entity there can be no name, so they spoke of it as Tao. We in the West have practically arrived at the same conclusion. What is it that makes flowers grow up and water flow down, which causes the showers to fall and the sun to shine, which guides the stars in their flaming courses, regulates the seasons, endows the butterfly with its radiant hues, gives one man red hair and another black, and, in a word, is the cause of every phenomenon we see, the mainspring of the huge machine of which we form a part? We, too, have failed to find a name for it, and so we call it Nature. This, I believe, is the key to early Taoism. Translate Tao, as used in this sense, by our common word Nature, and nine-tenths of the difficulties attending the study of this beautiful philosophy vanish of themselves. Nor is this true only of that phase of Taoism which deals with the physical universe. The instincts of animals and the workings of the vegetable creation are not any more the endowment of Nature than are the varying dispositions of mankind. The original constitution of every man, then, being the direct gift of Nature\u2014or rather, an actual part of Nature itself\u2014it follows that it should be jealously preserved intact, in all its pristine purity. This is the grand and primary object of Taoism\u2014the preservation of one's Heaven-implanted nature. And how is this to be accomplished? By imitating the great Mother. Nature never\nstrives; therefore the Holy Man should guard himself from striving too. Nature is ever passive; therefore the Holy Man should let things take their course, contenting himself with following in their wake. Ambition, scheming, hatred, lust\u2014any attention to external objects of whatever kind\u2014are all so much disordering, or apoliation, of the original nature of man, and should therefore be utterly discarded. Even the active cultivation of virtues, such as benevolence, rectitude and propriety, is condemned; nature requires no action to stimulate her growth, and all the Holy Man has to do is bring himself into perfect conformity with her. All such passions, accomplishments, and attributes, being the result of striving, are called, in Taoist phrase, the human nature of man, in contradistinction to the heavenly or natural nature with which he is endowed. \"Wherefore,\" says Chuang Tze, \"do not develop this artificial, human, or engrafted nature; but do develop that heavenly nature which is your natural inheritance.\" In Huaianan Tze's \"History of Great Light\" we have a still more striking passage, in which the difference between the two natures is lucidly explained. Speaking of those happy ones who, by having arrived at a thorough understanding of the principle of Nature, have reverted to a state of pure repose, he says: \"Nourishing their constitutions by tranquillity, and letting their spirits rest in indifference, they enter the Door of Heaven\u2014i.e. Nature. And what is it that is called the Heavenly? It is that which is homogeneous, pure, simple, undefiled, ungarnished, upright, luminous and immaculate, and which has never undergone any mixture or adulteration from the beginning. And what is the Human? It is that which has been adulterated with shrewdness, crookedness, dexterity, hypocrisy, and deceit; wherefore it bends itself in compliance with the world, and is brought into association with the customs of the age. For example: the ox has horns and a divided hoof, while the horse has a dishevelled mane and a complete hoof; this is the Heavenly\u2014or natural. Putting a bit into the horse's mouth and piercing the nose of the ox; this is the Human\u2014or artificial. Those who follow the Heavenly are such as roam in company with Nature; those who follow the Human are such as mix themselves up with the fashions of the world....Wherefore\", continues the philosopher, \"the Holy Man does not allow the Human to disorder the Heavenly\u2014he suffers no injury to be done to his true nature; nor does he permit Desire to disturb his natural feelings. He acts exactly as he ought, without considering what\nhe shall do beforehand; he is trustworthy, without promising; he obtains all he wants without anxiety, and he brings all his designs to completion without doing anything himself. His Spiritual Palace\"\u2014a Taoist euphemism for mind\u2014\"being replete with pure sincerity, he assists the Creator Himself in the government of men.\"\n\nThis leads me to the consideration of what may be termed the first development of the Naturalistic theory. In order to bring himself into conformity with Nature, it is imperative that the Holy Man should remain always and completely passive. This is expressed by the formula wu wei, which may be variously rendered \"non-exertion\", \"not-doing\", \"inertia\", \"absolute inaction\", or \"masterly inactivity\". In addition to the idea of undisturbed quiescence it embraces also that of spontaneity and designlessness; so that even the rigid adherence to an inactive policy is robbed of its full virtue if it be adopted with intent. The very effort to obtain possession of Nature, says Chuang Tsze, defeats itself, for the simple reason that it is an effort. A man must be passionless as well as motionless; he must be content to leave himself to the influences which surround him, and discard all thoughts of helping on the work; he must banish desire from his heart; he must concert no schemes and form no plans; he must never anticipate emergencies, but simply mould himself according to any circumstances that may arise. And especially is this of importance in the world of politics. Here the formula wu wei must be translated \"non-interference\"\u2014that wise and far-sighted policy the world is so slow to learn. The Taoist condemns over-legislation, and justly points to the peddling meddling system of a so-called paternal government as the cause of anarchy and ruin. Never do anything, he says, for the mere sake of doing it; never do anything that is not absolutely necessary; leave the people to develop their own resources, and feel their own way to tranquillity and prosperity. Let Nature work unimpeded, in social and political life as well as in the sphere of physics or of morals; then your subjects will be contented with their lot, and your kingdom free from conspiracies, dissensions, and disaster. Do nothing to disturb their primitive simplicity. Do not seek to replace their rough instruments of labour by complicated machines; such refinements lead to luxury, to scheming, to ambition, and to discontent; the very exercise of such ingenuity implies a scheming mind; therefore, discourage artificial innovations. The secret of happiness is to be found in quiescence, simplicity, and\ncontent; and the only way to attain to these is to bring body, passions, intellect and will into absolute conformity with Nature.\n\nThe descent from these sublime and simple ethics during the Han and succeeding dynasties was fatally rapid. They soon became obscured in a mist of hocus-pocus and imposture, in which idolatry, the prolongation of life, the elixir of immortality and the transmutation of metals played a prominent part. With this degraded phase of Taoism we have nothing whatever to do. It is only sad to reflect how soon and how irreversibly the ancient doctrines of Lao Tsze and his successors fell into desuetude and have since endured the reproach of their enforced association with a system of superstitious folly. The fine indifference of the old Taoists to life and death, wealth and poverty, has given way to sordid avarice and attempts to prolong the existence of the material frame; the pure code of the Naturalistic philosopher has been reversed; his precepts are forgotten, his dignity dishonoured. But the Canons of Taoism proper are still open to us, and they are deserving of careful study. The \"orthodox\" theories of the Rationalist school have surely had an ample share of attention from Western scholars, while the independent doctrines of the rival teachers have been in a measure neglected. And yet the Naturalists are far bolder and more original in thought than the Rationalists; they are trammelled by no slavish reverence for departed kings and exploded platitudes; their minds are free, their theories striking, and their practice pure. I will not write more upon this subject now, however, though in one sense it is almost inexhaustible. A forthcoming translation* of Chuang Tsze's \"Divine Classic of Nan-hua\" will, I trust, do something, however little, towards attracting the attention of sinologues to the beautiful Philosophy of Nature preached by the founder of Taoism; a study, I make bold to add, which cannot fail to yield rich stores of benefit to every one who takes it up, be he scholar, dilettante, or divine.\n\n* Since published.\nCONTENTS.\n\nARTICLE I.\u2014Notes on the Hydrology of the Yang-tse, the Yellow River, and the Peiho.

GUPPY, M.B.,\nSurgeon H. M. S. \"HORNET.\"\n\nIt will be unnecessary to enter into a general description of these three rivers which together form the great drainage-system of China: and I will therefore confine my remarks to the subject proper of this paper.\n\nWhile stationed in the waters of the Yang-tse and Pei-ho during 1877 to 1879, opportunities were afforded me of making observations on the discharge of water and sediment of these two rivers: and by supplementing my own estimates with those made at the close of last century by Sir George Staunton in the case of the Yellow River, I have been enabled to consider these three streams in their conjoint character.\n\n* Read before the Society on the 21st September, 1880.\nI. THE YANG-TSE.\u2014The waters of this great river begin to rise in the months of February and March; and attaining their highest level in June or July, they commence to subside about the end of August, or the beginning of September; reaching their lowest level about the close of the following January. The subjoined chart represents the rise and fall of the water at Hankow during 1876 and 1877.\n\nMEAN HEIGHT OF THE YANG-TSE.\n\nThe discharge of water at Hankow.\u2014The position of the foreign settlement at Hankow immediately below the union of an important tributary\u2014the Han\u2014with the main stream, renders it a very suitable site for estimating the amount of water discharged in that portion of the river\u2019s course. In order to obtain correct data it was necessary to ascertain the average depth of the river, its breadth, and the force of the surface current. By taking a\nline of soundings across the river from the middle of the \"bund\" (in November, 1877), I ascertained that by far the greatest bulk of water lay against the opposite shore or right bank, where a sounding of 62 feet was obtained within a few yards of the mud, (vide section below). The average depth of all the soundings\u2014thirty in number\u2014was 42 feet: and the breadth of the river at the same place was 1,450 yards (by sextant measurement).\n\nThe following table, formed from my own observations and from data obtained from the Custom House at Hankow and by reference to the China Sea Directory, contains the requisite materials for estimating the water-discharge:\n| Date          | Surface current | Average depth |\n|--------------|-----------------|---------------|\n| May 31st     | 2\u00bd knots per hour | 64 feet       |\n| June 30th    | 2\u00bd \"             | 61 \"          |\n| July 31st    | 3 \"              | 58 \"          |\n| August 31st  | 3\u00bd \"             | 62 \"          |\n| September 30th | 2\u00bd \"            | 63 \"          |\n| October 31st | 2 \"              | 53 \"          |\n| November 30th | 1\u00bd \"            | 42 \"          |\n| December 31st | 1 \"              | 36 \"          |\n| January 31st | \u00be \"              | 30 \"          |\n| February 28th | 1\u00bd \"            | 39 \"          |\n| March 31st   | 1\u00bd \"             | 45 \"          |\n| April 30th   | 2 \"              | 57 \"          |\n\nHaving ascertained the average discharge of water per second for the last day of each month of the year included between May 1877 and April 1878, I was able to obtain the average rate for the whole period by dividing the sum by the number of estimates. The following list gives the result of my observations:\n\nAverage discharge of water per second.\n\n| Date          | Cubic feet |\n|--------------|------------|\n| May 31st     | 846,336    |\n| June 30th    | 896,293    |\n| July 31st    | 1,029,656  |\n| August 31st  | 1,274,381  |\n| September 30th | 1,018,248 |\n| October 31st | 622,997    |\n| November 30th | 308,560    |\n| December 31st | 211,584    |\n| January 31st | 141,085    |\n| February 28th | 412,626    |\n| March 31st   | 396,720    |\n| April 30th   | 670,016    |\n\n\\[ \\frac{12}{7,822,502} = 651,875 \\]\n\n* Average velocity (four-fifths of surface current) \u00d7 Sectional area = Water discharge.\nWe may thus estimate the average discharge of water throughout the year at Hankow at 651,875 cubic feet per second.\n\nOn the probable discharge of the whole river. Now I estimate the drainage area above Hankow\u2014550,000 square miles\u2014to be equal to eleven-thirteenths of the whole catchment-basin\u2014650,000 square miles\u2014and by assuming that the area below Hankow drains off its waters at the same rate as the higher portion of the Yang-tse valley, an approximation may be made to the discharge of water of the whole river. By a simple calculation a result may be obtained which shews that the Yang-tse discharges into the sea as much as 770,397 cubic feet of water per second: or roughly-speaking it may be stated that, whilst this river carries 652,000 cubic feet of water per second past Hankow, it discharges as much as 770,000 cubic feet per second into the Yellow Sea. Capt. Blakiston,* when at I-chang, nearly 1,000 miles from the sea, estimated the water-discharge of the upper Yang-tse at 500,000 cubic feet per second: it would therefore appear that between I-chang and Hankow, which is distant about 600 miles from the sea, the river increases its bulk by 152,000 cubic feet; and between Hankow and the sea by nearly 120,000 cubic feet. These estimates all refer to the average discharge of water for the whole year.\n\nOn the amount of sediment carried down by the Yang-tse at Hankow.\u2014The proportion of sediment varied considerably in different seasons of the year: while in November 1877 the river contained about 4 grains in the pint, I found as little as \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of a grain in March 1878; and as much as 7 grains per pint in the following July, when the river was at its height. The average quantity of sediment throughout the year may be placed at four grains per pint of twenty ounces. This amount would represent a proportion of \\( \\frac{1}{15} \\) by weight; and taking the specific gravity of the dried mud at 1.9, as much as \\( \\frac{1}{15} \\) by bulk. If this fraction of bulk is applied to the total amount of water carried in a year past Hankow\u201420,557,530,000,000 cubic feet\u2014the annual discharge of sediment will be obtained; but to allow for the amount of mud a river pushes along its bed, one-tenth must be added, according to the method adopted by Messrs. Humphreys and Abbot.\n\n* \"Five months on the Yang-tse.\"\nin the case of the Mississippi. With this correction the total annual amount of sediment carried past Hankow may be estimated at $5,439,808,275$ cubic feet; which represents an average discharge of 172 cubic feet per second.\n\nBy assuming that the portion of the basin of the Yang-tse below Hankow supplies the same relative amount of sediment as the remainder of the drainage-area, we may, following the plan employed when estimating the water-discharge, place the total amount of suspended material carried down every year to the sea at $6,428,858,255$ cubic feet.\n\nOn the rate of subaerial denudation of the valley of the Yang-tse.\u2014Without entering into detail, it will be sufficient to state that the removal of this bulk of solid matter from the area of drainage\u2014650,000 square miles\u2014represents a lowering of the surface of $\\frac{1}{18}$ of a foot of sediment every year: but, allowing for the difference in specific gravity between sediment (1.9) and rock (2.6), the amount of suspended material is equivalent to the removal of $\\frac{1}{18}$ of a foot of rock in a year; or, which is the same thing, one foot in 3,707 years. This therefore represents the rate at which the surface of the Yang-tse valley is lowered.\n\nII. THE YELLOW RIVER.\u2014Those who may have read the narrative of Lord Macartney's embassy to China in 1792 will be familiar with the description given by Sir George Staunton of the methods employed in estimating the quantities of water and sediment discharged by the Yellow River at the place where it was crossed by the Grand Canal. The volume of water was placed at $418,176,000$ cubic feet per hour which is equivalent to $116,160$ cubic feet per second: while the sediment was estimated to reach the enormous bulk of $17,520,000,000$ cubic feet in a year. Though loth to disparage the value of these estimates given by Sir George Staunton\u2014for by so doing I shall weaken the premises of my subsequent conclusions\u2014yet I must accept with some hesitation results which have been obtained from a single experiment. Had I based my observations at Hankow on a solitary estimate, made either in the months of January or August; the difference between the two estimations would be represented by the numbers 9 and 1 (vide table): it should therefore be remembered that the estimates of Sir George Staunton are of more value as the trustworthy\nresults of a single observation than as representing the average discharge of water and sediment throughout the year. The rate of subaerial denudation of the basin of the Yellow River has been calculated to be one foot in 1,464 years.\n\nIII. THE PEI-HO.\u2014This river is indeed of small size when compared with the Yang-tse and the Yellow River; but it is worthy of consideration in this respect; that having obtained an approximate idea of the amount of water and sediment it discharges, we shall be able to consider the three rivers in their combined character. For the three winter months included between the beginning of December and the beginning of March, this river is frozen over; a character which distinguishes it from the Yang-tse and its sister stream.\n\nThe water-discharge.\u2014My observations were made at the foreign settlement of Tientsin, situated about 50 miles from the mouth of the river, and immediately below the junction of the Yu-ho (commonly known as the Grand Canal) and the Pei-ho proper. My data were confined to the four months from December 1878 to March 1879: but owing to the limited \"rise\" and \"fall\" of the river in the different seasons of the year, which do not often exceed six feet, I feel fairly confident that my estimate of the average discharge of water for these four months approximates the average discharge for the whole year.\n\nThe breadth of the river in March 1879 at the place of observation was 280 feet; the greatest depth 18\u00bd feet; and the average depth of all the soundings 14\u00bd feet. The following table refers to the variations in the velocity of the surface current and in the depth of water.\n\n| Month          | Average surface current | Average depth |\n|----------------|-------------------------|--------------|\n| December 1878  | 1\u00bd knots per hour       | 14 feet      |\n| January 1879   | \u00bd \"                     | 14\u00bd \"        |\n| February       | 1\u00bd \"                    | 16 \"         |\n| March          | 2 \"                     | 14 \"         |\nFrom the data given above I have estimated the average volume of water discharged per second during each month as follows:\n\nDecember 1878 .......... 6,355 cubic feet per second.\nJanuary 1879 ............ 4,389 \" \" \"\nFebruary \" ............. 9,684 \" \" \"\nMarch \" ..............10,592 \" \" \"\n\nThe average discharge for the whole of this period of four months may be placed at 7,707 cubic feet per second, or roughly speaking 7,700 cubic feet. For reasons above stated this estimate may be taken to fairly represent the average discharge for the whole year.\n\nOn the amount of sediment carried down to the sea.\u2014I found great variation in the amount of sediment contained in the river water from month to month. In the months of January and February, the quantity was not more than \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) of a grain per pint, in December 6 grains, while in March it averaged 11\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) grains, reaching in the middle of the month as much as 15 grains per pint. Taking the average quantity of sediment during the four months in question to be five grains per pint of twenty ounces, then the proportion of sediment by weight will be \\( \\frac{1}{1735} \\) and by bulk \\( \\frac{1}{3375} \\). Adopting the method of calculation employed in the case of the Yang-tse, we find that during this period of four months 26,655,417 cubic feet of sediment were carried past Tientsin. By assuming that this estimate fairly represents the rate of discharge during the remaining two-thirds of the year, we may place the total amount of sediment carried down annually to the sea at about 80,000,000 cubic feet.\n\nThe removal of this bulk of solid material every year from a drainage area of 55,000 square miles* is equal to the lowering of the whole surface of one foot in 25,218 years. This therefore represents the rate of denudation of the basin of the Pei-ho. I had not the means of ascertaining the amount of material held in solution in either the water of the Yang-tse or the Pei-ho, an element which has been omitted altogether in every one of these\n\n---\n\n* In Keith Johnston's Universal Gazetteer the drainage-area of this river is stated to be 24,000 square miles; such an estimate can only refer to the Pei-ho \"proper,\" and I have had in consequence to adopt my own computation.\nthree rivers: but what an important factor has been disregarded not only in the case of the Chinese rivers but in similar estimations relating to other rivers of the globe, will be rendered evident by a brief perusal of Prof. Huxley's recent work on Physiography.\n\nIV. THE YANG-TSE, THE YELLOW RIVER, AND THE PEI-HO.\n\n\u2014We have now the necessary materials for considering these three rivers in their conjoint character. Together they drain an area of 1,105,000 square miles or about four-fifths of China \"proper\": together they discharge a volume of water into the sea equal to 894,000 cubic feet per second (more correctly 894,177), and a mass of sediment amounting in a single year to as much as 24,028,800,000 cubic feet.* Attention should be once more directed to the great variations in the proportion of sediment contained by these three rivers: the maximum quantity I observed in the waters of the Yang-tse was seven grains in the pint; in those of the Pei-ho 15 grains; while Sir George Stannton found over 80 grains in the same quantity of water, an estimate which he accepted as typical of the whole year: I have already referred to the peril or receiving such a inference and have urged its acceptance as a quantum caelest experiment.\n\nWith reference to the combined rate of subaerial denudation of these rivers, it will be sufficient to state that the removal every year of 24,028,800,000 cubic feet of sediment from an area of 1,105,000 square miles represents a lowering of the surface of one foot in 1,687 years.\n\nThe following table will enable us to obtain an idea of the rank held by the Yang-tse, the Yellow River, and the Pei-ho in the river system of the globe:\n\n* By some misconception certain Authors have adopted Stannton's estimate of the sediment discharged by the Yellow River and have accepted it as a general computation for the river system of China: e.g. Page's advanced Text Book of Geology.\n| River       | Water per second | Sediment per annum | Subaerial denudation |\n|------------|------------------|--------------------|---------------------|\n| Amazon     | 2,458,036 cubic ft. | ........ | ........ |\n| Congo      | 1,900,000        | ........ | ........ |\n| Yang-tse   | 770,397          | 6,428,900,000 cb. ft. | 1 foot in 3,707 years |\n| Plate      | 700,000          | 1,843,500,000     | 29,400              |\n| Mississippi | 615,924          | 7,474,000,000     | 6,000               |\n| Danube     | 300,831          | 1,255,500,000     | 6,846               |\n| Shat-el-Arab | 295,461         | ........ | ........ |\n| Ganges     | 203,485          | 6,368,000,000     | 2,358               |\n| Indus      | 199,476          | ........ | ........ |\n| Atrato     | 185,274          | ........ | ........ |\n| Nile       | 130,032          | ........ | ........ |\n| Yellow River | 116,160         | 17,520,000,000    | 1,464               |\n| Rhone      | 91,935           | 594,000,000       | 1,628               |\n| Rhine      | 69,741           | ........ | ........ |\n| Po         | 61,263           | 405,420,000       | 729                 |\n| Pei-ho     | 7,707            | 80,000,000        | 23,218              |\n| Thames     | 2,900            | 1,865,900         | 9,800               |\n\nOn the time required to fill up the Gulfs of Pechili and Lian Tung, the Yellow Sea, and the Eastern Sea north of parallel 29\u00b0 and west of the 126th meridian.\u2014By reference to a map it will be at once perceived that the portion of sea included above receives the waters and sediment discharged by the three rivers under consideration. Sir George Staunton estimated that the sediment carried down to the sea by the Yellow River would fill up the Yellow Sea with the Gulfs of Pechili and Lian Tung in a period of 24,000 years:* Elis\u00e9e Reclus affirms that the Yellow Sea is\n\n* At that period the Yellow River discharged its waters into the Yellow Sea.\nmuch deeper than Staunton stated it to be, and that this estimate should be doubled: on carefully examining the latest charts of these seas, I am inclined to think that Sir George Staunton's estimate of the average depth\u201420 fathoms\u2014is not more than two or three fathoms below the truth. Following the same method of calculation in the case of the larger portion of sea, I find that the total surface area is about 200,000 English square miles; and I place the average depth of the whole region at 26 fathoms.\n\nAccording to the present discharge of sediment of these three rivers, a period of 66 days would be required to form an island a mile square and reaching to the surface: and, assuming that there is no elevation or depression of the sea-bottom, an interval of 36,000 years would be requisite to form the whole sea under consideration into dry land. But we have the witness of raised beaches with historical and other evidence to prove that in our own time the Northern Coast of China is undergoing a gradual upheaval: and for this reason a period considerably less than 36,000 years will be required to convert the sea into terra firma. In very truth, Sir George Staunton's original estimate as applied to the Yellow River may not fall short of the time required by the three rivers to fill up the whole sea under consideration.\n\nThe following is the substance of some remarks made by the President after the reading of the paper:\n\nIn the account of Lord Macartney's journey referred to in the paper, an extract is given from the Journal of Mr. Barrow, in which it is stated that 14 gallons of the water of the Yellow River contained 2\u00bd cubic inches of mud. If this were dried mud it would represent fully 80 grains per pint. I have personally examined over 200 miles of the Yellow River, and although I have made no measurements of the mud contained, I can confidently assert that it cannot amount to anything like the above quantity.\n\nI have made measurements of the cross section of the river and have obtained the best information I could regarding the depth of water and speed of current at different seasons.\n\nI estimate the discharge (very roughly) as follows:\n\n- Extreme low water .............. 18,000 cubic feet per second.\n- Ordinary low water ............. 36,000 \" \"\n- Flood discharge .................. 112,000 \" \"\n\nThe last amount gives 408,900,000 cubic feet per hour, or almost exactly the amount given in the paper.\n\nConsidering the frequent floods I should not be surprised to learn that future careful observations gave the average discharge at 800,000,000 cubic feet per hour, and the sediment 50 per cent in excess of that in the Yang-tse.\nI have examined the Pei-ho on several occasions, but always between March and October. Last year I had occasion to measure the cross section near the bridge of boats, and, taking the speed and depth at what appeared to me to be their normal amounts, I arrived at a discharge of 9,000 cubic feet per second. Seeing that the observations in the paper extended over four months, I should not have thought of giving the result of my observations, were it not that the paper refers entirely to the winter months, while my experience of the river is confined to the summer months, and my observations therefore go to show that had Dr. Guppy extended his observations over a whole year the average discharge would have come out slightly in excess of the amount of 7,700 cubic feet per second given in the paper.\n\nNOTE.\u2014Dr. Guppy contributed to NATURE, September 23rd 1886, a letter going over much the same ground as the above, which led to an interesting discussion in the pages of that periodical on the main points at issue. An explanation offered by Mr. T. Mellard Read is that the excessive estimate of the amount of silt conveyed by the Yellow River was owing to the possible measurement of the deposit in a wet state seems to offer some explanation of the discrepancy between that river and the Yang-tse. Experiments on the mud in the depositing tanks of the Cairo water-works show that the difference between the bulk wet and dry may amount to as much as 10\u00bd to 1. If Sir George Staunton's results be divided by ten the result of 1,755 millions of cubic feet per annum as compared with the 6,479 of the Yang-tse would fairly represent the different character of the two rivers, the Yellow River containing in its waters a palpably greater proportion of silt than the Yang-tse. The conclusions to be derived from Dr. Guppy's paper are of great Geological interest, as bearing on the age of the Mid-Asian Continent. Leaving the Yellow River out of the question, as that stream has for the most part flowed into the Gulf of Pechili, we may form an approximate estimate of the age of the delta of the Yang-tse. Taking the depth of the delta to average 150 feet and assuming Dr Guppy's calculations of the annual deposit as 6,783 millions of cubic feet, which they seem to amount to, the annual superficial growth of the delta would amount to 1.6 miles. We may assume 40,000 square miles as the area of the alluvial deposit extending from Ningpo to the bed of the Wei. This would give an age of 25,000 years for the delta. In my address to the Society on the 20th February, 1877,* I assumed a rate of denudation of the drainage area of the Yang-tse amounting to one foot in 2,700 years, deriving thence an age for the delta of 18,500 years. Subsequent calculations led me to reduce this amount, and fix the time required for deposition at somewhat over 20,000 years. The age of the delta of the Ganges and Brahmaputra has been put down at about 25,000 years, which is in remarkable accord with the other calculations. With regard to the supposed \"raised\" sea beaches, those which have been detected in the Yang-tse delta, as well as the present distribution of the water supply, go to prove that the oscillations of level since the commencement of the delta have been of the slightest, and that practically speaking the levels of the North-east of China have remained unchanged during the period of deposition.\n\nTHOS. W. KINGSLEY.\n\n* Vol. XI, page 18.\nARTICLE II.\n\nSOME NOTES ON THE GEOLOGY OF TAKOW, FORMOSA.*\n\nBy H. B. GUPPY, M.B.,\n\nH. M. S. \"HORNET.\"\n\nA NARROW entrance, about 60 yards in width and bounded on each side by precipitous limestone cliffs, leads into the lagoon-like harbour of Takow. This harbour, which is from 6 to 8 miles long and from 1 to 2 in breadth, is bounded on the south by a low sand spit 300 or 400 yards across and several miles in length; while on the north lies a flat plain through which winds a small river, which empties itself into the harbour. On the north side of the entrance Ape's Hill rises to a height of 1,100 feet above the sea, while Saracen's Head, a low hill about 170 feet in height, immediately overlooks the entrance on its southern side. A level plain extends between Ape's Hill and the distant range of mountains; in the midst of which rises the abrupt eminence of Whale-Back Hill which, removed from 4 to 5 miles to the northward of Takow, attains an elevation of 700 feet above the sea.\n\nThe leading physical features thus briefly described point to the conclusion that the harbour of Takow is of recent origin in comparison with the age of the island of Formosa. There was probably a time when the small river emptied its waters directly into the sea: the sand spit as such did not exist; and Saracen's Head was isolated by water from the adjoining coast. The river had not improbably in those ages a somewhat steeper gradient than it has at present; and the impetuosity of its current would be diminished, and in consequence its power of transporting material would be lessened when it discharged its waters with their suspended sediment into the sea. A bank might then be formed, which by means of a gradual upheaval of the sea bottom, assisted by the surf of these Formosan seas, might have given rise\n\n* Read before the Society on the 21st September, 1880.\nto the present spit. Should the same conditions, which determined the formation of the spit, still be in operation, the bar, which extends off the entrance to this port in a direction almost continuous with that of the spit, will in the lapse of time be raised above the level of the waves, and the harbour of Takow will be greatly extended.\n\nWith reference to the more strictly geological features of Takow, I was enabled to make a few notes during a stay of ten days in that port. The white compact limestone of Ape's Hill is honey-combed to a marked degree on its weathered surface by the long continued action of the rain and other atmospheric agencies. The honey-combed external surface, with the dark colour externally of this limestone rock, caused it to be mistaken by the writer of a paper in the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society of 1873 for a rock of igneous origin.\u2014\"The rocks are of igneous formation\"\u2014thus the author of the paper asserts when referring to Ape's Hill\u2014\"and are built up of a multitude of cells, the whole mass appearing to have been suddenly chilled while in a state of ebullition, presenting a series of jagged flint-like edges difficult to ascend.\"\u2014This impression of the igneous origin of Ape's Hill is an error which might readily have been avoided by a moment's inspection of the fractured surface of the rock.\n\nThe limestone often rises abruptly from the sea; and in the portion of Ape's Hill that bounds the entrance to the harbour I observed that the rock was stratified and that it dipped to the East at an angle of from 35 to 40\u00b0. I obtained several fossils from a hill-slope, situated near the sulphur spring (which I will refer to towards the close of the paper). The limestone in which they were embedded was of a more earthy texture than that met with in the higher parts of Ape's Hill. The following fossils were collected:\n\n(a) A species of *Scutella* which was very abundant. Some specimens were embedded as they would have lain on the sea bottom, whilst others were raised upon their edges.\n\n(b) *Balanidea* mostly small and evidently embedded \"in situ\" on the surface of the rock.\n\n(c) A species of a genus of corals resembling \"Cyclolites.\"\n\n(d) Spines of *Echinia*, often of considerable size. I was only\nable to obtain one \"sea-urchin\" and that a small one.\n\n(e) *Pecten*, *Ostrea* and other bivalves, with a curious fossil, apparently a cast of a spiral univalve.\n\n(f) *Polyzoa* on the surface of the shells and scutellae: a single specimen of a small crab: a shark's tooth; and some fragments of coral.\n\nOn the summit of the ridge or hill where the fossils were obtained, I observed a fissure in the rock, varying from one to three feet across and extending for some 200 or 300 yards in a N. W. to S. E. direction: by dropping a stone I ascertained that it was of no great depth. I have been informed by residents at Takow, that besides other similar fissures there are caves often of considerable length, which, situated nearly half-way up Ape's Hill on the edge of the plateau, are rather difficult to find without the assistance of a guide as their entrances are small and often concealed partially by herbage. Loose bones are found on the floor of these caves. I was very much disappointed at not being able to find them; and the shortness of my stay prevented me from continuing the search. However I would especially recommend the careful examination of these caves and fissures to any resident at Takow, and particularly the investigation of the floor-deposits.\n\nHigher up the sides of Ape's Hill I found no signs of bedding which may have been concealed by the honey-combed weathered surface of the rock. The ascent is tedious by reason of the sharp edges of the limestone which are often concealed by the long grass. Nearly half-way up the hill and elevated about 450 feet above the sea, there is an extensive plateau about two miles in length and one in breadth, from which the upper half of Ape's Hill rises steeply to its summit. The same compact limestone rock continues to the top.\n\nThe low eminence of Saracen's Head, on the opposite side of the entrance to the harbour, is of the same compact limestone. A steep cliff 170 feet high faces the sea, at the foot of which lie huge masses of rock\u2014evidences of the eroding action of the sea. In the face of the cliffs there appear to be lines of horizontal stratification; but on obtaining a side view, the beds are seen to dip away to the East, though with rather a smaller inclination.\nthan that already noticed on the opposite side of the entrance. In many cases the face of the cliff was coated with a stalagmitic crust of carbonate of lime.\n\nI should not omit to notice the existence of a sulphur-spring in a small bay of the harbour facing the native town. Impregnating the air in its vicinity with a strong odour of Sulphuretted Hydrogen, it oozes out at several places at the base of the hill\u2014the largest outlet being covered at high water. The water also issues from small holes in the limestone just above the main spring; and retains the temperature of the air. At the summit of the spur\u2014at the base of which the spring occurs\u2014extends the fissure I have previously referred to.\n\nIf I might draw some conclusions from the foregoing observations, they would be as follows.\n\n(1) The collection of fossils which I obtained evidently shews that the limestone in which they are embedded is of recent origin. I did not succeed in finding any fossils in the higher parts of Ape's Hill: but, according to the late Mr. Swinhoe, recent shells and corals are found at Takow at a height of 1,111 feet above the sea. To have been found at this height they must have occurred at the summit of Ape's Hill. Such was not my experience.\n\n(2) The inclination of the strata in the lower part of the hill and the existence of the fissures, have a common origin in the upheaving process which raised the mass of limestone forming Ape's Hill 1,100 feet above the sea. The extensive plateau, elevated about 450 feet above the sea level, points to the cessation of the process of upheaval during a lengthened period, in which the part of Ape's Hill that rises from the plateau alone shewed itself above the sea. Then came another period of upheaval in which the lower part of the hill was raised above the waves, and the rocks highly inclined.\n\n(3) It is difficult to explain the presence of these isolated limestone eminences in the midst of a plain; and one is reminded of the somewhat analogous case of the Rock of Gibraltar. The explanation that most readily presents itself, is that of the growth of a coral reef on a gradually\nsubsiding bottom, followed by the upheaval of the whole mass above the waves. This is not altogether a satisfactory solution of the problem; but such as it is it offers the readiest way out of the difficulty.\nARTICLE III.\n\nBOTANICON SINICUM.\n\nNOTES ON CHINESE BOTANY\nFROM NATIVE AND WESTERN SOURCES.\nBY E. BRETSCHNEIDER, M.D.\n\nPART I.\n\nPRELIMINARY NOTICES.\n\nMORE than ten years have elapsed since I published a little essay intended to show the mode adopted by the Chinese in treating of Natural science, especially Botany, and what degree of advantage European botanists may derive from the study of Chinese botanical works. The present paper now brought before the public, although treating of the same subject and reproducing occasionally the matter of my former essay, will prove to be virtually a work new in substance, entirely recast, into which also a considerable amount of new information has been introduced.\n\nIn resuming my past labours after a long interval I cannot but repeat what I confessed in the preface of my former paper, that I am neither a Sinologue nor Botanist, my knowledge of Chinese as well as of Botany being quite limited. It may well then be\n\n---\n\n1 On the Study and Value of Chinese Botanical Works, with Notes on the History of Plants and Geographical Botany from Chinese sources, by E. Bretschneider. Illustrated with 8 Chinese wood-cuts. This article appeared originally in the \"Chinese Recorder\" of 1870 and 1871, published in Foochow. The editor of this periodical, at that time, seems to have had little experience in proof-reading; at any rate my paper (although presented in a very clear manuscript) came to light with such a profusion of misprints and other inaccuracies, that it would have been ridiculous to append to it a complete list of errata. I therefore would feel quite disposed to disavow this my first scientific essay; all the more since at the time I wrote it I had not yet sufficiently mastered the subject, and many of my former statements require modification.\nasked whether the author has the acquirements to fulfil the difficult task he has taken in hand; and what value may be assigned to a work dealing with matters for the elucidation of which the author declares himself not sufficiently trained by appropriate fundamental studies. I therefore owe to the reader some explanation as to the extent of my competence.\n\nNobody will, I think, object to my asserting that, for western people, Chinese is of all languages the most difficult; and (I should also say) the most ambiguous. When I first arrived at Peking, 15 years ago, I felt a desire to make myself acquainted with the language in order to be able to utilize the vast literary treasures of the Chinese for the benefit of European science. I soon however became aware of the great difficulties to be encountered, and the long space of time which would be required to learn the language thoroughly. I therefore adapted my studies more exclusively to the branches of Chinese literature I intended to investigate, namely Natural History and Historical Geography. Here in Peking students of Chinese, even with a moderate stock of knowledge, do not generally find any difficulty in producing correct translations; and every information in this connection can easily be obtained from Chinese teachers or books. There are, I imagine, very few, if any, sinologues in China who translate independently and without availing themselves of the assistance of native scholars.\n\nAs to the botanical part of my researches, my own knowledge in this department generally is of secondary consideration only. During my long sojourn in China I have always been busy collecting plants, and in so doing I have paid especial attention to those employed by the Chinese for economic and medicinal purposes, ascertaining when possible their native names from books as well as from converse with the natives. My collections I have\n\n---\n\n2 I hardly think that any sinologue, who has pursued his studies in China and read ancient Chinese authors (even with the assistance of a good native scholar), would in every case agree with the great sinologue Stan. Julien, who in his Syntaxe de la Langue Chinoise, I. p. 1, states that for an instructed sinologue the Chinese language is as clear and intelligible as any other. Unfortunately we have frequently to complain of the vagueness and want of precision of the Chinese style, the authors generally being more anxious to imitate what they call the classical style than to convey in their writings a clear idea of what they mean to say.\nbeen in the habit of sending for determination to several of the most eminent botanists of our time, whose names will be frequently met with in this paper, and who have always afforded me liberal assistance in elucidating many dubious questions relating to interesting Chinese plants. This may suffice for the present to enable the reader to form an opinion as to the reliability of the statements put forward in these pages. It may be added that, having access to the splendid libraries of the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission and of the Russian Legation in Peking, where all Chinese works of importance and many rare European books relating to China are to be found, I was enabled to avail myself of many sources of information which it would be difficult to obtain elsewhere, either in China or in Europe. These favourable conditions encouraged me to enter upon the vast, yet almost unworked field of investigation of Chinese Botany from Chinese sources. It is the first attempt of the kind, and is published with a view to laying a foundation for future inquiries. My notes have been written for sinologues as well as for botanists, and I must beg the latter not to be alarmed at the frequent occurrence of Chinese hieroglyphics in the text. No knowledge whatever of Chinese is required to understand the quotations met with in these pages.\n\nM. Alph. De Candolle was the first to point to the importance of Chinese records for elucidating certain dubious botanical questions. His admirable work on Geographical Botany\u2014a most interesting science first created by that eminent botanist\u2014concludes in the following terms:\n\n\"L'anciennet\u00e9, en Chine et au Japon, de quelques unes des races de plantes cultiv\u00e9es est curieuse, du m\u00eame que la s\u00e9paration du peuple chinois d'avec le peuple de l'Inde, \u00e0 une \u00e9poque recul\u00e9e, s\u00e9paration qui se prouve par des cultures diff\u00e9rentes et par des noms de plantes usuelles, absolument diff\u00e9rents. J'ai senti \u00e0 plusieurs reprises dans mes recherches combien\n\n8 I may notice here that an eminent botanist in Europe has distinguished himself also as a sinologue. Steph. Lad. Endlicher, born in 1804, died in 1849 as Director of the Botanical Garden, Vienna, known by his numerous botanical writings (his \"Genera Plantarum\" is still a standard work), published in 1845 a Chinese Grammar and also an Atlas of China. He does not however seem to have directed his attention to Chinese botanical works.\n\"l'\u00e9tude des encyclop\u00e9dies chinoises et japonaises pourrait rendre plus de services \u00e0 l'histoire des esp\u00e8ces cultiv\u00e9es, laquelle \u00e0 son tour est importante pour l'histoire des nations.\"\n\nIndeed a considerable amount of information, interesting to botanists and throwing light especially on the history of cultivated plants, is found in Chinese literature, but is generally difficult to discover, and often involved in a mass of other matter, appreciated only by Chinese readers. We know from their ancient records the plants cultivated in China at an early period, when it had no intercourse with the other nations of Asia. We meet also with positive statements of ancient authors regarding other economic plants now abundantly grown all over the Empire, but introduced from other Asiatic countries, especially Western Asia, after these regions had become known.\n\nAfter the discovery of America a great many American plants were introduced by the Spaniards and Portuguese into the Philippines and the Indian Archipelago. Their cultivation spread rapidly over the neighbouring regions of the old continent, and they found their way also to China. Most of these plants have become perfectly naturalized in Asia and, had the proof of their introduction from America not been preserved in ancient western records, they would certainly be considered natives of Asia. There are some other plants now generally cultivated in America as well as in Asia regarding which even M. De Candolle, notwithstanding his diligent researches, is unable to state, whether they are indigenous in America only, or whether they have been cultivated from time immemorial in Asia also. For the decision of these questions the ancient Chinese records again prove to be of great weight.\n\nAn important aid towards defining the geographical distribution of plants in China is found in the geographical works of the Chinese, and such information is all the more precious, as our botanical knowledge regarding the interior of the Empire is still almost a blank. In another place we shall speak more in detail of this branch of native literature.\n\nThere are numerous Chinese works dealing especially with Botany, Agriculture, and other kindred sciences relating to Practical Botany. They are replete with information regarding the uses of plants for food, clothing, manufacturing purposes, etc.\nIn introducing my work I may take the opportunity of explaining in a few words the plan of arrangement. I have divided it into a general and a particular part. The first, which forms the substance of the present paper, begins with a review of the History of Botany, Agriculture and Materia medica of the Chinese and other Eastern Asiatic nations, entering into some details concerning the most prominent treatises and authors in these departments. In the same chapter I shall attempt to show the method employed by the Chinese in describing plants and in investigating Botany and Materia medica.\n\nAnother chapter is devoted to the important question of identifying Chinese names of plants with scientific botanical names. I shall record the attempts made by European scholars to ascertain the botanical names of the plants described in Chinese books.\n\nThe first part will conclude with an alphabetical list of Chinese works, and another of Chinese authors quoted in native botanical treatises (the greater portion never before noticed in European books on Chinese literature). The time of publication will of course always be given, as this is a matter of primary importance for our investigations.\n\nIn the second part I shall endeavour to present a history of Chinese domestic, ornamental, medicinal, and other plants used for economic purposes, as far as these have come to the knowledge of botanists. My information has been derived from native authors as well as from European scientific works.\n\nCHAPTER I.\nCONTRIBUTION TOWARDS A HISTORY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF BOTANICAL KNOWLEDGE AMONG EASTERN ASIATIC NATIONS.\n\n1. Chinese Literature on Materia medica and Botany.\n\nBefore I proceed to enter upon the subject, it may be well to recall a few points in Chinese ancient history intimately connected with our researches into the history of plants and Botany from native sources.\nThe early history of the Chinese, like that of other nations, is veiled in obscurity. It is a view generally held by western scholars, although not the slightest evidence confirming it is found in the early historical records of the Chinese, that the birthplace of this race was somewhere in Central or even in Western Asia, and that they entered their present land from the northwest, apparently by the main route along and across the Yellow River. It seems that this supposition of Chinese immigration is principally based upon the fact, that the most ancient Chinese historical documents establish the existence of aborigines in China, quite different from the \"black-haired people,\" as the ancient Chinese termed themselves. Obscure as is the origin of this nation, it is certain, however, that when they first appeared on the stage of history about 3000 years B.C., they considered themselves indigenous in China. For ages they were a people of no consequence, developing themselves independently and quite apart from other Asiatic nations. For many centuries they were acquainted only with their immediate neighbours, with whom they were constantly at war. The southern part of the present province of Shansi was the cradle of the Chinese Empire, whence it gradually extended its power in all directions, but less towards the south. We may therefore conclude that all the Chinese names of plants met with in the earliest native historical documents refer principally to northern Chinese plants, all indigenous in these regions. Even at the time when Confucius compiled the Classics (about 500 B.C.), the Chinese dominions did not extend far south of the Yang tze kiang. The present provinces of Shensi, Shansi, Chihli, and Shantung formed the northern part of China in that period. But the centre of Chinese civilisation was then in Southern Shensi, especially in the valley of the Wei River and in the present Honan. For nearly 30 centuries the Chinese Emperors resided in these provinces in the neighbourhood of the Wei River or the Yellow River.\n\nThe Emperor Ts'in Shi Huang Ti, B.C. 246\u2014209, celebrated as the builder of the Great Wall (the same who ordered the burning of all Chinese books, sparing only those on Medicine, Divination and Husbandry), succeeded first in establishing his\nauthority over the feudal states of China. He subjected the whole Empire to one sole sovereign, and then conquered the regions which are now comprised in the provinces of Fu kien, Kuang tung and Kuang si, known in ancient times by the general name of Nan Y\u00fce. But in B. C. 206 Nan Y\u00fce revolted and became again independent.\n\nThe Emperor Wu Ti, B. C. 140\u201486, of the Han dynasty, made himself master of the south-western portion of present China and reconquered Nan Y\u00fce, subjecting also a part of Annam. Then the Chinese Empire had nearly the same limits as the Chinese assign to China proper now-a-days. It was under the glorious reign of this Emperor that China, after centuries of isolation, became first acquainted with Japan and the countries of Central and Western Asia. I am aware that a French orientalist has endeavoured to prove that an embassy from Egypt was sent to China as early as B. C. 1113, and that 130 years later the Chinese Emperor Mu wang visited Western Asia. But such assertions are nothing but fantastic dreams. We can safely assume that, before the second half of the second century B. C., the Chinese had no intercourse with the distant countries of Western and Southern Asia, and were even ignorant regarding the tribes dwelling in Central Asia.\n\nIn about 139 B.C. Emperor Wu ti despatched one of his officers named Chang K'ien on a diplomatic mission to the Yue chi (or Yue ti), a people who first dwelt near the north-western frontier of China, but had been driven away by the Hiung nu and had then settled near the river Oxus. The Hiung nu at that time occupied the steppes of Mongolia and were constantly at war with China. Chang K'ien, who had necessarily to pass through their dominions, was made prisoner and retained\n\n---\n\n2a We read in the Ssu fu kung tsu, an ancient description of the public buildings in Ch'ang an, the ancient metropolis during the Han, near the present Si an fu in Shensi (see alph. list of works 647), as follows:\n\nAfter the Han Emperor Wu Ti, in B. C. 111, had subdued Nan Y\u00fce, he built the palace Fu li, (in Ch'ang an), and in the garden appertaining to it a number of rare herbaceous plants and trees brought from those southern regions were planted. Among the plants enumerated there I have been able to identify the following:\n\nNephelium Litchi, N. Longan, Canarium album, C. Timelia, Areca catechu, Cassia Cassia, the Banana; Cassia indica, Quisqualis indica, sweet Oranges.\nfor ten years by the shan yu (Khan) of the Hiung nu. Finally he succeeded in escaping to the west and penetrated to the countries of the Jaxartes and the Oxus, where he spent more than a year. On his way back he was again laid hold of by the Hiung nu, but escaped a year later and returned to China in 126 B.C. He brought back intelligence about various regions in the west and their natural productions. The official report of his observations and his biography are preserved in the Shi ki or Historical Record compiled by the celebrated Sze Ma ts'ien, a contemporary of Chang K'ien (book 111). In ancient catalogues (see Introduction to alph. list) Chang K'ien is reported to have published a narrative with the title Hai wei i shu ki, Record of remarkable things in foreign countries. The Emperor rewarded Chang K'ien after his return, and some years later raised him to the dignity of prince. In B.C. 123 he was commander-in-chief of the Chinese troops directed against the Hiung nu. Owing to a defeat the Chinese had suffered Chang K'ien was cashiered, but was afterwards pardoned. He died about B.C. 108. He is said to have introduced many useful plants from Western Asia into China. Ancient Chinese authors ascribe to him the introduction of the Vine, the Pomegranate, Safflower, the Common Bean, the Cucumber, Lucerne, Coriander, the Walnut-tree and other plants.\n\nAfter Chang K'ien had first visited the countries of the west, the geographical knowledge of the Chinese in that direction rapidly increased. China extended its dominions over a great part of Central Asia, and envoys were frequently sent to the realms of Western Asia, and even to India, which country had been known to Chang K'ien only from hearsay. Since the introduction of Buddhism into China, about A.D. 66, intercourse between China and India had become very frequent and continued for centuries, but India was then generally reached by the long circuit of Bactria and Kabul.\n\nThe art of perpetuating books by engraving characters upon wood or stone and then printing from the plates, can be traced back in China as early as A.D. 503, but it is probable that an invention of this kind to multiply writings existed there much\nearlier. It is certain that the Chinese enjoyed at least 800 years earlier than European nations these advantages of diffusion of literature and preservation of ancient records and documents. This circumstance has done much to prevent the loss of many ancient native writings, which render the study of Chinese literature so useful and interesting for European antiquaries.\n\nThe early history of the botanical knowledge of the Chinese is closely connected with the history of their Agriculture and Medicine; and their acquaintance with plants dates back from the period when they first began to employ plants for economical and medical purposes.\n\nAccording to Chinese tradition the semi-mythical Emperor \u795e\u8fb2 Shen nung, who is said to have reigned in the 28th century B.C., is the Father of Husbandry and Medicine. The Li ki (one of the Classics, see further on) states that Shen nung was born near the \u5c71 Li shan (Sui chou, Northern Hupeh). He is said to have subsequently dwelt in \u897f Ch'en (Western Honan), and then moved to \u5357 Lu (Southern Shantung). See the last edition of the Shi ki (Historical Records), in the first pages of which the ancient traditions regarding this Emperor have been brought together. 13 li north of Lu an fu (Southern Shansi) there is a mountain called \u767e\u7a40\u5c71 Po ku shan, mountain of the cereals, with a temple on its top, where, according to the I t'ung chi or Great Geography of China, Emperor Shen nung is still worshipped. This temple was founded in the 6th century of our era. At the foot of the mountain is the po ku ts'\u00fcan, or fountain of the cereals. Here tradition makes Shen nung first teach his people how to till the ground and raise grain. Hence it was that his grateful subjects called him Shen nung or Divine husbandman.\n\nIt has also been handed down by tradition that Shen nung first tested the medical qualities of herbs and discovered medicines to\n\n---\n\n4 Compare Dr. W. Williams' interesting article on the subject in the \"Chinese Recorder,\" 1875, p. 22.\n5 The term po ku, which occurs first in the Classics (Shi king, Shu king), properly means \"the hundred cereals,\" but the Chinese frequently use the numeral \"hundred\" in a general sense.\ncure diseases, and the city of Wen hien (Huai king fu, Honan) claims to be the spot where this happened. In the Wen hien chi (topography of this city) it is stated that the \u795e\u8fb2\u6e6f, rivulet of Shen nung, is situated inside the eastern gate. Here according to tradition Shen nung collected medicinal herbs, tested them and touched the soil with his staff, whereupon the water sprung forth. The earliest writings on medicinal plants and dietetics are ascribed to him. 2607 B.C. is given as the year of his death.\n\nShen nung's successor, the Emperor \u9ec3\u5e1d Huang ti, who reigned in the 27th century B.C., is said to have established his residence in \u6d3e\u9e7f Cho lu (Pao an chou, west of the present Peking). He is considered the author of the first Chinese works on the art of healing. See Alph. list of works 204.\n\nTHE MATERIA MEDICA OF EMPEROR SHEN NUNG.\n\nThe well known Chinese Materia medica, Pen ts'ao kang mu, of which I shall offer a detailed review in the proper place, in giving an opening sketch of the principal treatises of this class, begins with the \u795e\u8fb2\u672c\u8349\u7d93, Shen nung Pen ts'ao king, or Classical work on Medicines* of the Emperor Shen nung. We find there the following account of this ancient document, which we know only from the quotations of it in other succeeding ancient works of the same kind, to which it has served as a model.\n\nChang Yu si (who lived in the first half of the 11th century) says: According to ancient tradition this treatise was in 3 books and Emperor Shen nung was the author of it. But no ancient author states that he has seen it himself. In the section on literature in the Ts'ien Han shu (History of the Former Han dynasty, 202 B.C.\u201425 A.D., where many medical works extant in the first century B.C. are enumerated) no mention is made of this book. But in the biography of Emperor P'ing ti, 4th year of his reign (A.D. 4), we find a statement that the Emperor ordered all men in the Empire, familiar with medical prescriptions\n\n---\n\n* Li Shi chen, the author of the Pen ts'ao kang mu, explains that the term Pen ts'ao properly means \"Herbal,\" but, as the majority of medicines are derived from the vegetable kingdom, it is used to designate a treatise on drugs in general.\nand the Pen ts'ao (see note 6), to assemble in the capital.\u2014In\nthe biography of Lou Hou (Ts'ien Han shu, 92) it is said\nthat, when he was yet but a boy, he knew by heart the I king,\n(treatise on medicine), the Pen ts'ao and several thousands\nof medical prescriptions. Thus there can be no doubt that at that\ntime there existed a Pen ts'ao.\n\nLi Shi tsai (an author of the T'ang period, 7th century), and\nbefore him the T'ei ku, a work of the Liang dynasty (6th\ncentury), speak of the Shen nung pen ts'ao in 3 books; suggesting\nthat it was probably committed to writing during the Han\ndynasty, for there occur in the book names of places in China\nreferring to the time of the After Han (25\u2014221 A.D.). Ac-\ncording to these authorities Chang Ki or Hua T'o may be the\nauthors of it. But Chang Yu si (who quotes the above state-\nments) does not agree with this opinion. He admits an early\nexistence of the Pen ts'ao king and adduces the Huai nan ts'ao\n(2nd century B.C.), which records that Emperor Shen nung in\nthe space of one day tasted the plants and experimented on their\nefficacy. He found among them 70 to be poisonous. This was\nthe beginning of medical art in China.\n\nChang Yu si continues: In remote times, when the art of\nwriting was not yet known, science was transmitted from gene-\nration to generation by oral tradition, and what was called Pen\nts'ao then was not a written book. From the period of the Han\ndynasties (B.C. 202\u2014A.D. 221) medical art began to develop.\nChang Ki and Hua T'o largely contributed to the diffusion and\ncompletion of medical knowledge, commented on previous writings,\nand added new information, arranging the whole into a system.\nThis was probably the time when the Materia medica of Shen\nnung first appeared as a written treatise.\n\nK'ou Tsung ski (about 1115 A.D.) says: In the History of the\nHan dynasty it is stated that it is not certain who first compiled\nthe Pen ts'ao. The Shi pen (written before the Han period) and\nthe Huai nan ts'ao duly record that Shen nung tasted plants and\nexamined their medical virtues, but they do not speak of a Pen\n\n---\n\n7 Celebrated physicians in the third century of our era. See further on note 12\n(5 and 6).\nta'ao. There is however a statement in the Ti wang shi ki (History of the early Emperors, compiled in the 3rd century) that Huang ti (the successor of Shen nung) ordered his minister K'i po (see note 13) to examine the efficacies of plants, to compose a Pen ts'ao king (a standard herbal), and to lay down prescriptions for curing diseases. This proves that the appellation of Pen ts'ao can be traced back to the time of Huang ti. Nature had bestowed on the ancient sages peculiar faculties for recognizing instinctively, by the taste of natural productions, what was their efficacy in curing sickness. The rules they established were followed by the sages of later times who tried to complete and to enlarge the original matter.\n\nAccording to Li Shichen (the author of the Pen ts'ao kang mu), the Shen nung Pen ts'ao king was originally a treatise in three parts treating of 365 different drugs. It was first commented on by T'ao Hung king (A.D. 452-536) who wrote also a supplement to it (see further on Ming yi pie lu).\n\nIn the great catalogue of the Imperial Library, book 104, fol. 51, we read that the Shen nung Pen ts'ao king does not exist now-a-days as a separate treatise and that we know it only from the T'ang Shen wei Pen ts'ao (a Materia medica of the Sung dynasty; see further on No. 26.) in which the passages printed in white letters on black ground all refer to the text of the Shen nung Pen ts'ao.\n\nThe Pen ts'ao kang mu reproduces also to some extent the text of the Materia medica of Shen nung and generally quotes this treatise under the abbreviated title of \u672c\u7d93 Pen king. Under the head of \"the celebrated arrangement of drugs by the Emperor Shen nung\" the Pen ts'ao kang mu, in the first book, first part, fol. 43 sq., gives the text of a part of the Shen nung Pen ts'ao relating to the qualities, the use, the gathering of drugs, etc. That ancient document arranges the drugs under 3 classes and reads as follows:\n\nOf the first class of drugs there are 120 sorts which are considered to perform the functions of \u541b\u541b or Sovereigns. They support human life, and thereby resemble Heaven. They are not poisonous. Whatever quantity you take, or howsoever long you\nuse them, they are harmless. If you wish to have the body light, to improve the breath, to live to an old age, without growing old, make use of these drugs of the first class.\n\nAmongst the drugs of the first class are reckoned:\n\nGinseng, Rad. Nanhuii speciosi, Euryale ferox (semina), Jujubes, Oranges, Jobstears, Dioscorea, Benincasa hispida, Amaranthus Bitum, Capsella bursa pastoris, Sonchus arvensis, Camellia salicis, Ulmus pumila (bark eaten as food). - Pachynea pinctorum, Mushrooms, Cuscuta bark, Liquorice, Rehmannia glutinosa, Kochia scoparia, Tribulus terrestris, Kudzu, Alisma plantago, Acorus, Typha, Plantago, etc.\n\nThere are 120 sorts of drugs of the second class, which are considered to perform the functions of \u90e8 ch'en or Ministers. They support human nature, and thereby resemble man. Some of these drugs are harmless; others are poisonous. They ought to be used with discretion.\n\nIf you wish to lessen the violence of diseases and re-establish decayed strength, use the second class of drugs.\n\nAmongst the drugs of the second class we find: Ginger, Paonia Montana, Paonia alba, Lilium tigrinum, Xanthium strumarium, Gentiana, Polypodium Barometes, Niphotobus Lingua, Zanthoxylum, Trichosanthes, Thladiantha dubia, Lenna, etc.\n\nThere are 125 sorts of drugs of the third class which are considered to perform the functions of \u52a9\u4f50, Assistants and \u5e2e\u52a9, Agents. They cure diseases, and thereby resemble earth. They are very poisonous and ought not to be used continuously. If you wish to drive out cold or heat from the body, or to correct the breath, or to open obstructions, or to heal diseases, use the drugs of this class.\n\nAmong the drugs of the third class are reckoned: Rheum palmatum, Phytolacca acinosa, several species of Euphorbia, Aconite, Veratrum Rhododendron, Croton, Peach kernels.\n\nThe drugs of these three classes make in all 365, corresponding in number to the number of degrees of the zodiac; each degree answering to one day of the year.\n\nIt does not come within the province of our investigations to translate the whole chapter which explains the system of that primeval Emperor regarding the qualities and efficacy of medicines, and illustrates the views entertained up to this time on the subject in China. A translation of the greater portion of this curious document will be found in Du Halde's la Chine III 444-459 and also in Bridgman's Chin. Chrestomathy 503 sq. (trans. Dr. W.

As the greater part of them are natives of North-China and known to me, I shall give here the botanical names of those plants of the Shen nung Pen ts'ao which I have been able to ascertain.

Besides some scattered notices on Chinese plants this Classic contains a chapter entitled \u79ae\u8a18 Y\u00fc kung or Tribute of Emperor Yu, which presents a peculiar interest for us. This is a geographical description of ancient China, referring to about 2200 B.C., in which are enumerated the principal natural productions of each of the nine provinces into which China was then divided.\n\nThe \u8a69\u7d93 Shi king, or Book of Odes, likewise compiled by Confucius, is replete with names of plants, which however are often difficult to ascertain. There are even special Chinese works dealing with the plants and animals mentioned in the Shi king and the commentaries on them. The oldest work on the subject is the \u6bdb\u8a69\u8a3b\u91cb Mao Shi ts'ao mu niao shou ch'ung yu shu, Commentary on the herbs, trees, birds, beasts, insects and fishes mentioned in \u6bdb\u8a69 Mao Ch'ang's version of the Shi king, in 2 books, by \u9686\u5100 Lu ki, literary name \u58eb\u8861 Shi heng, of the kingdom of Wu, 200-303 A.D. The original work was lost and that now current was compiled, it is not known when and by whom, mainly from K'ung Ying ta (Dr. Legge, Shi king).\n\nIn quoting the Shu king and the Shi king I always refer to the splendid translations by Dr. Legge.\n\nThe \u5468\u79ae Chow li, or Ritual of the Chou dynasty, B.C. 1122-249, gives a good deal of interesting information on Chinese plants, domestic and others. It was written about 1100 B.C. A good French translation of this classic was published by Biot, 1851.\n\nThe \u79ae\u8a18 Li ki, Book of Rites. Although the matter contained in it is of early origin like that of the other classics, it came to light in its present form about the close of the first century B.C. It is especially the section entitled \u79ae\u8a18 Y\u00fce ling, Rules for every month of the year, in which names of plants frequently occur and which is often quoted in Chinese botanical works. The Li ki has been commented upon by \u912d\u7384 Cheng huan, A.D. 127-200.\nThis classic has never been completely translated into any European language. The translation of the Li ki by Callery into French, 1853, is only an abstract of the work.\n\nTHE \u96f7 \u7a2e RH YA.\n\nThis seems to be at first sight the most interesting among the classics for our purposes of research. It is a Dictionary of terms used in Chinese ancient writings generally ascribed to \u5468 \u516c Chou kung, the Duke of Chou, about 1100 B.C. It was completed by \u5b50 \u8cc8 Th' Hia, a disciple of Confucius, nearly 700 years later, and remodelled into its present shape by \u90ed \u6fec Kuo P'o in the 3rd century. It seems that the Rh ya was principally intended to explain terms occurring in the Shi king (of which, as is known, a considerable part has been lost.) In his commentaries Kuo P'o frequently quotes the Book of Odes and also the Li sao, the famous poetical production of Ku Yuan, 4th cent. B.C. and the Kuang ya, an ancient dictionary, the author of which lived in the middle of the 3rd cent. (See alph. list Nos. 445, 383.)\n\nThe greater half of the matter in the Rh ya, arranged under 19 sections (\u91cb shi, properly: explanation), treats of natural objects. The names of plants are found in the 13th and 14th sections under the heads of \u8349 ts'a, Herbs and \u6728 mu, Trees. Nearly 300 plants are enumerated there and in other sections as many animals. In some editions the text is accompanied with drawings. In the preface of the illustrated edition of 1802 it is stated that these wood-cuts originally date from the time of the Sung dynasty and that they have been carefully reproduced from a manuscript copy made by one who lived in the time of the Y\u00fcan or Mongol period (13th or 14th cent.). According to the History of the Sui dynasty (section on literature, book 32) there existed in the Liang period (6th cent.) two volumes of drawings illustrating the Rh ya, which were made by Kuo P'o, but they had been lost.\n\nA recent account of the Rh ya by E. C. Bridgman is found in the Chinese Review (1849), p. 169.\n\nThe original drawings of plants extant in European collections are those accompanying the copy of Dioscorides, Materia medica, dating from the 5th century, preserved in the Great Vienna Library.\na volume of drawings illustrating the Rh ya. See T'ang shu, section on literature. Kiang kuan lived in the 4th cent. (see his biography Tsin shu 83), according to some authorities in the 6th cent. The drawings of the Rh ya now extant are generally very rough and, so far as plants are concerned, seldom enable one to recognize what particular plant is intended.\n\nThe original information given in this ancient dictionary with respect to natural objects is extremely aphoristic and fragmentary, not more than three, sometimes four characters being devoted to each name, and as I understand, these characters represent the book names and the popular names of the plants and animals without other explanations. Each phrase of the Rh ya is followed by the commentary of Kuo P'o. The sounds of uncommon words are always given.\n\nThe Rh ya had already been commented upon by several Chinese scholars previous to Kuo P'o. In the History of the Sui (section on literature) three authors of the Han period are mentioned, who had written commentaries on this dictionary, viz: \u7576\u5149 Fan Kuang, \u5289\u6b46 Liu Hsin (first cent. B.C.) and \u674e\u905c Li Sun.\n\nKuo P'o was a celebrated scholar and expositor of the Taoist doctrine who lived A.D. 276-324, a native of Wen ki hien (Kiang chou, Shansi). His literary appellation was \u8cc8\u7d43 King ch'ien. He was invested with the posthumous title \u912d\u7e23\u4faf Heng xian hou shou (Prefect of the ancient department of Heng xian, in the present Ho nan). See his biography Tsin shu 72. His preface to the Rh ya reads as follows: (see Bridgman l.c.)\n\nThis book, the Rh ya, is designed to exhibit the general scope of education, to point out the sources of poetic composition; to collect and arrange the phrases of past generations, and to discriminate the real distinctions between things that seem to be identical.\n\nIt is in deed a safe conduct for men of all professions, a key to all arts, a deep fountain for the scientific reader, and a flower garden for the \"belles lettres\" writers.\n\nIf a work be desired that will enlarge our knowledge of all things, free us from every delusion, and extend our acquaintance with the various departments of natural history, there is none so useful as the Rh ya.\nThe Rh ya had its origin in middle antiquity and was in the highest repute during the Han, when its varied uses were unfolded on the occasion of the disquisition regarding the Leopard rat (\u8c79\u9f20)11\n\nThen the illustrious and erudite scholars, the elegant and master writers of the age, all honored, esteemed and highly appreciated both its principles and its lessons of instruction.\n\nRegardless of my inability and want of knowledge, I commenced the study of it while yet but a young man and zealously and assiduously continued the same twice nine years.\n\nAlthough many commentators had exercised their talents upon it, yet none of their works were complete. Much in them was confused and erroneous, and some things were omitted and still wanting.\n\nFor these reasons I have in my turn undertaken to bring together the meanings of the words and to collect all the ancient explanations. I have extended my researches to the dialects of all the different states of the Empire and made collections from the popular songs and sayings. Having thus collected a great variety of terms and by careful examination ascertained their correct and popular use, I have endeavored to remove all defects and inaccuracies and to put away all that is low and vulgar.\n\nWhen quotations, which were not common or well understood, have been made, they have been supported by requisite proofs, but all such as seemed plain and easy have been passed over without comment.\n\nMoreover, with a view to prevent all misunderstanding, I have in separate parts indicated the sounds and added drawings.\n\nThus I have labored hard to make clean and plain the path of learning, earnestly hoping that, by this work, the progress of scholars in future times may be greatly facilitated.\n\nSome of the ancient names of plants found in the text of the Rh ya are still in use, but the majority of them were unknown even at the time when Kuo P'o lived and he tried therefore to explain what plants were meant, giving their popular names. In\n\n---\n\n11 Compare W. F. Mayers' article on the Mammoth in Chinese records, China Review VI, p. 273.\nall probability he utilized previous commentaries for his explanations. Chinese writers on botany place absolute confidence in the identifications given by Kuo P'o. But a closer investigation of the subject has convinced me that in this respect he proceeded as arbitrarily as the swarms of other Chinese commentators of the classics, and that his statements must be accepted with caution. I have the same mistrust with regard to Chinese identifications of the archaic names of plants as found in the Shi king and other classical writings.\n\nAnother commentary of the Rh ya was published with the title of \u7d93\u96c5\u6b63\u7fa9 Rh ya cheng i by \u5b6b\u708e Sun Yen, styled also \u5b6b\u53d4\u7136 Sun Shu yen, a contemporary of Kuo P'o. Comp. Biograph. Dict. Shang yu lu.\n\nSubsequently to the time of Kuo P'o the Rh ya was commented upon by \u90a2\u663a Hing Ping A.D. 932-1010, and by \u912d\u6a35 Cheng Ts'iao, A.D. 1108-1162. Compare Ss' k'u ts'uan shu ming mu lu IV, 16. Mayers' Chin. Read. Man. p. 52.\n\nIn the 11th century a work on the plan of the Rh ya, an appendix to it, with the title \u6f14\u96c5 Pi ya, in 20 books, was composed by \u9686\u5fb7 Lu Tien, A.D. 1042-1102. Comp. Ss' k'u etc. IV, 17. Mayers l.c. p. 140.\n\nA similar appendix appeared a century later with the name of \u7d93\u96c5\u7ffc Rh ya i, in 32 books. The author of it was \u9e97\u9806 Lo Yuan, styled also \u8ad6\u9801 Yuan liang and \u5b58\u58fd Ts'un ts'i. He lived in the 12th century. Sung shi 380.\u2014Ss' k'u etc. IV, 17.\n\nI may finally mention here the \u5c71\u6d77\u7d93 Shan hai king; Classic of the Mountains and Seas. It is an ancient geographical description of China of a somewhat fabulous and mythical character. The authorship is generally ascribed to the Emperor Yu, B.C. 2200. According to Mr. Wylie (Notes on Chin. lit. p. 35) it is at least as old as the Chou dynasty and probably of a date even anterior to that period. We meet in it with a profusion of names of mountains and rivers unknown now-a-days, and the position of which is indicated only in a general way. Many plants and animals are likewise mentioned in it, but in many cases we can make nothing of these names.\n\nThe Shan hai king in 13 books is noticed in the bibliographical\nsection of the History of the Former Han in the catalogue compiled in the 1st century B.C. Kuo P'o wrote a commentary on it. The edition now current is in 18 books. Compare Journal Asiatique, 1839: Notice du Chan hai king par M. Bazin (ain\u00e9), where some specimens of the work are given.\n\nTHE \u5357\u65b9\u8349\u6728\u72c0 NAN FANG TS'AO MU CHUANG.\n\nThis is the earliest Chinese treatise dealing with plants and bearing a purely botanical character. The title means: Account of the Flora of the Southern Regions. The author was \u7a0b\u542b Ki Han, a Minister of State under Hui ti of the Tsin dynasty, A.D. 290\u2014307. He had been previously Governor of Canton. See his biography, Tsin shu 89. This small treatise is not a rare book, it is found in the Han Wei ts'ung shu (Wylie l.c. 209) and other collections of reprints. It is also reproduced in the botanical section of the famous T'u shu tsi ch'eng, books 3, 5, 15, 186. We meet in it with interesting accounts of some trees and other plants known at that time in South-China, some of them brought from distant foreign countries. The plants are treated under the four classes of herbs, forest-trees, fruit-trees, and bamboos, including in all 80 species. Among the plants described there the following can be ascertained:\n\nThe Banana.\nJasminum officinale.\nJasminum Sambac.\nThe Nutmeg-tree.\nCanna indica.\nSweet-potato (Batatas).\nBetel-leaf.\nLong Pepper.\nAcorus.\nQuisqualis indica.\nSugar-cane.\nPhyllodes placentaria, Lour.\nLivistonia chinensis.\nClerodendron squamatum.\nBrassica napus.\nIpomoea reptans.\nCymbidium ensifolium.\nLiquidambar formosana.\nOlibanum (brought from western countries).\nFicus retusa.\nLitter-seeded Cardamom.\nCinnamomum Cassia.\nCorylus syriacus.\n\nLawsonia (Henna).\nAloezyum Agallochum.\nCloves.\nCaryota.\nTerminalia Chebula.\nCaesalpinia Sappan.\nGlyptostrobus heterophyllus.\nCunninghamia sinensis.\nVitex Negundo.\nRattans.\nAreca Catechu.\nCocoa-nut.\nMyrica sapida.\nNephelium Litchi.\nNephelium Lungan.\nCanarium Pinela.\nCanarium album.\nCoco de Mer.\nAverrhoa Carambola.\nVarious Oranges.\nPhyllanthus Emblica.\nAleurites triloba.\nSpindias.\nVarious Bamboos of South-China.\nBesides the 80 plants described under separate headings, several other Chinese plants are mentioned \"en passant\" under the same Chinese names by which they are still known in this country, viz.:\n\nHibiscus mutabilis.\nVitis vinifera.\nNelumbo speciosum.\nZingiber officinale.\nDioscorea sativa.\nCaladium esculentum.\nGardenia florida.\nSterculus platani folia.\nRhapis flabelliformis (perhaps Chamaerops?)\nBrassica chinensis.\nSagittaria chinensis.\n\nArundo phragmites.\nDendrobium moniliforme.\nDiospyros Kaki.\nPomegranate.\nEriobotrya japonica.\nAlthaea sinensis.\nSophora japonica.\nJuniperus chinensis.\nCedrela sinensis.\nCastanea vesca.\nAcacia Julibrissin.\nJuglans regia.\n\nA short record of a similar character to the Nan fang ts'ao mu chuang is the \u82b1\u6728\u5fd7 Wei wang Hua mu chi, Notice of the Flowers and Trees of the Prince of Wei (perhaps the Prince of Wei is the author). It has likewise been reprinted in the T'u shu tai ch'eng l. c. book 5, and as I can infer from the place assigned to it in that Encyclopaedia, it seems to belong to the same period (perhaps a century earlier) as the Nan fang ts'ao mu chuang. It is sometimes quoted in the Pen ts'ao kang mu. I have not been able to gather any other information regarding its author or time of publication in any Chinese bibliographical work. Among the 15 plants recorded in it I may mention the following:\n\nThe \u601d\u60df & wei or \u8c9d\u591a Pei to tree, the seeds of which are said to have been brought from India at the time of the Han dynasty, is Borassus flabelliformis.\u2014Magnolia Yulun.\u2014Camellia japonica.\u2014Hibiscus syriacus.\u2014Cinnamomum Cassia.\u2014Citrus japonica.\u2014Rhododendron.\u2014Quisqualis sinensis.\n\nCHINESE STANDARD WORKS ON MATERIA MEDICA.\n\nI now proceed to review briefly in chronological order the Chinese works on Materia medica (and Natural History) which at different times have been considered the capital treatises in this department. My information regarding these compilations and their authors has for the greater part been derived from the bibliographical notices already mentioned, given by Li Shi chen in the introductory part of the Pen ts'ao kang mu. From these accounts I select the more important statements, occasionally elucidating them by extracts drawn from other quarters. Li Shi\nchen reviews in all 42 of such works of note on Materia medica. The Shen nung Pen ts'ao king (1.), which we have already dwelt upon and which forms the nucleus of all subsequent Chinese treatises on the subject, is placed at the head of the 42 works reviewed, the earlier of which, having long been lost, were known to Li Shi chen only from the accounts and quotations given of them by previous authors. After the Shen nung Pen ts'ao the next in order of time is\n\n2. The \u67f4\u85e5\u9304 Ts'ai yao lu, directions for gathering drugs, in 2 books, by \u6850\u541b T'ung k\u00fcn; one of the ministers of the Emperor Huang ti. This treatise gives also some descriptive accounts of medicinal plants.\n\n3. The \u96f7\u516c\u96c6\u5c0d Lei kung Yao tai, Materia medica of Lei kung, who was one of the sages employed by the Emperor Huang ti in his labours to perfect the art of healing. This treatise, to which tradition ascribes a high antiquity, was published (from an ancient manuscript, I understand) in 2 books with additional remarks and commentaries by \u5f90\u4e4b\u624d Su Chi ts'ai, a celebrated physician living in the second half of the 6th century, a native of Tan yang (Chin kiang fu). See his biography Pei Ts'i shu 33.\n\n4. The \u674e\u6c0f\u85e5\u9304 Li shi Yao lu, Materia medica of Li or \u674e\u5e38\u4e4b Li Tang chi, a subject of the Wei dynasty, in the first half of the 3rd century. He was a disciple of the celebrated Hua T'o (see note 12).\n\n5. The \u5433\u6c0f\u672c\u8349 Wu shi Pen ts'ao, Materia medica of Wu or \u5433\u666e Wu Pu, a native of Kuang ling (present prefecture of Yang chou fu in Kiang su), likewise a subject of the Wei, first half of the 3rd century, and a disciple of Hua T'o. He compiled his treatise, one book, from the works of the Emperors Shen nung and Huang ti, and the writings of K'i Po, T'ung k\u00fcn (see above 2), Lei kung (see above 3), Pien Ts'iao, Hua T'o, and Li Tang chi (see above 4).\n\n---\n\n12 The above names refer to ancient celebrated Chinese physicians. Besides the primeval Emperors\u2014\u795e\u8fb2 Shen nung (styled also \u85e5\u8056 Yao sheng, the sage of\n6. The \u708e\u708e\u8ad6 P'ao chi lun by \u96f7\u516c Lei kung or properly \u96f7\u654f Lei Huao, who is not to be confounded with the Lei kung\n\nmedicines) and \u85ac\u738b Huang ti (styled also \u8ed2\u8f45 Hien yun and \u85e5\u738b Yao song, prince of medicines), already spoken of\u2014the \u5341\u5927\u540d\u91ab shi ta ming i or ten celebrated Doctors are worshipped in the chief medical temple in Peking, called \u85e5\u738b\u5edf Yao song miao, and in other temples. See Dr. J. Dudgeon's interesting paper on Medical Divinities, China. Recorder 1870 III., p. 40. On the tablets in that temple we find the following names of famous physicians. I add some biographical notices gathered from various sources.\n\n1. \u654f\u4f2f K'i Po, styled also \u85e5\u7956 Yao tan (ancestor of medicines), a native of Northern China, one of the assistants of Emperor Huang ti, his tutor in medical investigations and the reputed founder of the art of healing. Hence the phrase \u654f\u9ec3\u8853, the science of K'i po and Huang ti for medical skill. See Mayers' Chin. Read. Man. p. 97. The Pen tsao kang mu, I. b. fol. 12 sq., gives some specimen of K'i Po's views on the nature of drugs. In the section on literature in the Sui shu mention is made of a work named \u654f\u4f2f\u7d93 K'i Po king.\n\n2. \u96f7\u516c Lei kung, a physician of the time of Huang ti. See above No. 8.\n\n3. \u5c48\u539f Pien Tsiao, likewise one of the physicians of Huang ti, but according to another tradition a famous physician of the 6th century B.C. See his biography in the Shih ki (Histor. record) book 105, and Mayers' Chin. Read. Man. p. 172. Pien tsiao, known also under the name of \u79e6\u8d8a\u4eba Ts'in yue jen, was a native of \u6e56\u5357 Po hai (in the present province of Chihli, Ho kien fu), but subsequently took up his abode in the state of Lu, wherefore he is sometimes styled \u85e5\u5e2b Lu i (the physician of Lu). He is said to have first gained a knowledge of the internal parts of the body. The theory of the pulse is likewise derived from his discoveries. A medical treatise \u96b1\u96e3\u75c5 (on difficult medical questions) is attributed to him. See alphab. list of works, 652.\n\n4. \u6f22\u4e8e\u610f Ch'en Yu i, an official of the time of Emperor Wen ti (179\u2014156 B.C.), having charge of the public granaries in Ts'\u00eai, and hence entitled \u592a\u5009\u516c Ts'ai tung kung. See Mayers' Chin. Read. Man. p. 87; Shih ki, book 105, where his biography is found. He devoted himself to the study of the art of medicine, in which he attained to wondrous skill. He has left a collection of medical prescriptions. See alph. list of works, 849.\n\n5. \u5f35\u4ef2\u666f Chang Chung king, sometimes styled also \u6a5f\u4ef2\u666f Ki Chung king or \u5f35\u6a5f Chung Ki. Wen hien tung k'ao 222, Wylie, Chin. lit. 80, 82. He was a native of \u5357\u967d Nong yung (province of Honan) and prefect of Ch'ang sha (Hu nan) during the latter Han, its seems end of the second century. He was a celebrated physician and has left a treatise on fevers and several other medical writings. See alph. list of works, 678, 828, 829.\n\n6. \u8ad6\u8a9e Hua T'o, literary appellation \u5143\u5316 Yuan hua, second century and first half of the third. A native of \u6cb3\u5357\u90e1 Pei kuo ts'ao (present Pe chou, An hui), a renowned physician, the Esculapius of China, Mayers' Chin. Read. Man. p. 68; Chin. Reps. II. 275; Hou Han shu, book 112b. Hua t'o is said to have been versed in all the secrets of Taoism, and to have been especially successful in surgical operations. He is reputed to have relieved the great Ts'\u00eao ts'ao (the founder of the Wei dynasty, died 320) from a cerebral disease by means of an operation. He was also in possession of an anaesthetic agent for producing insensibility during surgical\nof Huang ti's time (see above 3), for Lei Hiao with the title Lei kung was an author of the Liu Sung dynasty (A.D. 420\u2014477). The P'ao chi lun was a treatise in 3 books, explaining the medical virtues of 300 drugs and giving directions for the preparation of medicines.\n\n7. We now come to one of the most important ancient treatises on Materia medica, the \u540d\u91ab\u5225\u9304 Ming i pie lu,\u2014as this title implies, an account of drugs or medicines recommended (after the time of Shen nung) by eminent physicians. In the Pen ts'ao kang mu this work is generally quoted with the abbreviated title of Pi's lu. The author of it was \u8ad6\u5b8f\u666f Tao Hung king, A.D. 452\u2014536 (see his biography Liang shu 51), one of the most celebrated adepts in the mysteries of Taoism and a distinguished operations. In his biography this medicine is called \u9ebb\u7169\u6563 ma fei san, which has been erroneously translated by Stan. Julien, Tatarinov and others by \"a preparation of Hemp.\" The character ma means indeed Hemp, but is also used to designate in the popular language \"insensibility,\" and \u9ebb\u85e5 ma yao is to be translated by \"anesthetic prescription.\" The prescriptions which in Peking go by the name of ma yao contain Aconite, the tubers of some poisonous plants of the Arum family. Henbane, sometimes Datura, Hua t'o fell afterwards a victim to political intrigue and perished by T'ien ts'ao's command, more than a hundred years old. Several medical treatises are attributed to him.

I have not been able to find these names in Chinese biographical dictionaries or medical works. Perhaps \u6a0a\u901a Huang Fu mi, a celebrated scholar A.D. 215\u2014282, who has also left some works on medicine, and \u674e\u6642\u73cd Li Shi chen, the author of the Pen ts'ao kang mu.\n\nIn the temple Tung yo miao, near Peking, there are also tablets of the ten celebrated doctors, and here we find instead of Huang fu and Li shi chen two other names, viz.: \u5b6b\u601d\u9088 Sun Sae mo and \u8463\u6148\u85cf Wei Tsz' ts'eng. The first was a celebrated Taoist and physician of the 7th century (see further on works on Materia medica No. 9), the second a famous Court physician in the beginning of the 8th century. He is mentioned in the Kiu T'ang shu 191.\n\nFor biographical notices regarding other celebrated Chinese physicians (Bridgman's Chin.

The Emperor Kao ti of the Ta'i dynasty, 479\u2014482, made him preceptor of the Imperial princes; and the Emperor Wu ti of the Liang, 503\u2014550, was at one time among the number of his disciples. T'ao Hung king subsequently retired into seclusion among the recesses of the mountain \u516c\u5c71 Kow k'\u00fc shan, where the eighth of the haunted grottoes of the Taoists, the \u9053\u967d\u6d1e Hua yang tung is situated, and devoted himself to meditation and study. The Emperor Wu ti endeavoured in vain to attract him into public life, and was accustomed to consult him. (Mayers' Chin. Read. Man. p. 214). T'ao Hung king is also known under the name of \u9053\u96b1\u5c45 T'ao yin ku (T'ao the hermit) or \u9053\u96b1\u771f\u5165 Hua yang chen jen (the saint of Hua yang). Besides this he is sometimes styled \u9053\u660e T'ung ming (his literary appellation).\n\nLi Shi chen states that the Shen nung Pen ts'ao king specifies in three books 365 drugs in accordance with the number of days. T'ao Hung king in the Pie lu added 365 new medicines recommended by famous physicians of the Han and Wei dynasties. This treatise comprised seven books. The text of Shen nung's Materia medica was represented in it by red characters, whilst T'ao Hung king's additions were written in black characters. He presented his composition to the Emperor Wu ti of the Liang. One chapter of the Pie lu, treating of the preparation of medicines, is reproduced in the Pen ts'ao kang mu, book 1a fol. 55 sq., and was translated into French by Viadelou. Cf. Du Halde: La Chine III, 458\u2014459.\n\n8. The \u85e5\u7d71\u9304 Yao tsung kue, another treatise on medicines, in two books, is a production of the same author.\n\n9.

He was induced circa A.D. 630 to leave his mountain hermitage for the court of Emperor T'ai Tsung, where he performed many miracles. Sun Sz' mo is the author of numerous medical treatises. See alph. list 31, 707, 934\u2014937. He is one of the celebrated doctors of China and is worshipped in the state temples among the divinities of the healing art.

The \u85e5\u6027\u672c\u8349 Yao sing pen ts'ao, on the medical virtues of drugs, in four books, by \u9806\u6b0a Chen Kuan, a native of Hui chou (Honan), end of the 6th and first half of the 7th century. He died under the reign of T'ai tsung (A.D. 627\u201450) at the age of 120 years. See his biography in the T'ang shu 252. He also wrote a treatise with the title \u85e5\u6027\u8ad6 Yao sing lun and other medical works.\n\n11. The \u5510\u672c\u8349 T'ang Pen ts'ao, or Materia medica of the T'ang dynasty. The Emperor Kao tsung issued about A.D. 650 a mandate for the revision and completion of the Shen nung Pen ts'ao and T'ao yin ki's commentaries and additions (see above 7). This was undertaken by a commission under the superintendence of \u674e\u52e3 Li tsi, a high officer. The new work comprised seven books and was generally styled \u82f1\u516c\u5510\u672c\u8349 the T'ang Pen ts'ao of Ying hung, the latter being a title of Li tsi. A few years later \u8607\u606d Su Kung, another high official, was appointed to revise and to complete it once more. \u9577\u5b6b\u7121\u5fcc Chang Sun wu ki and 22 others were associated with him in the work. They added 114 new objects, and classed the whole under the heads of Minerals, Man, Quadrupeds, Birds, Insects, Fishes, Cereals, Vegetables, Fruits, Trees, Herbs, and natural objects not employed in medicine. This was called the \u5510\u65b0\u672c\u8349 T'ang Sin pen ts'ao or New Pen ts'ao of the T'ang. The descriptive part of it extended to 20 books, with one book for the index. To this were added\n\n---\n\n13 The T'ai po shan, where one of the haunted grottoes of the Taoists is situated, lies in the south-western corner of the prefecture of Si an fu.\n25 books of pictorial illustrations representing natural objects, and 7 books of annotations explaining the drawings.\n\n12.

This is a compilation from previous works on Materia medica, with some additional matter on dietetic food.\n\n20. The \u85e5\u672c\u8349 Sha Pen ts'ao was compiled about the middle of the 10th century by order of \u738b\u7bc4 Meng Ch'ang, prince of Sha (the modern Ss' ch'uan, then governed by an independent ruler). The prince entrusted with this task \u7a0b\u4fdd\u6607 Han Pao sheng, a Doctor of the Academy, and some distinguished physicians, and wrote himself the preface to the work, which was published in 20 books, illustrated by wood-cuts. It professes to be a revision and an amplification of the T'ang Pen ts'ao (see 11).\n\n21.

It was compiled in compliance with an\nImperial order in A.D. 1057, in 20 books, by Chang Yu si, a high functionary, assisted by Lin i, another high official, and several physicians of note. Chang Yu si, a distinguished scholar, was a native of Yen ch'eng hien (Hui chou, Honan). 1082 articles are detailed in this treatise, 82 of them being new.\n\n24. The T'u king pen ts'ao, or illustrated Pen ts'ao, in 21 books, published by Imperial order, was compiled by Su Sung, a high functionary and distinguished scholar, a native of Ts'ian chou in Fu kien, after the Kia yu pen ts'ao (see 23) had been completed. The drawings of the natural productions of China in this work had been executed by Imperial command from nature in the various districts of the Empire. Use had also been made of similar earlier drawings dating from the T'ang period (see above 11). This illustrated Materia medica comprised 21 books.\n\n25. The Pen ts'ao pie shuo, the production of Ch'en Ch'eng, a distinguished physician, was published about A.D. 1090. It is a revised combination of the Pen ts'ao and the T'u king (24).\n\n26. The Cheng lei pen ts'ao, known also under the name of Ta kuan Pen ts'ao, for it was compiled in the second year of the reign of Ta kuan, A.D. 1108, by Shen wei, a physician of Shu (the present Szechuan). This work unites all that was most valuable in the earlier treatises on Materia medica. The matter is arranged in 31 chapters under the heads of: Precious stones, Metals, Herbs, Cereals, Vegetables, Fruits, Trees, Insects, Fishes, Birds, Quadrupeds, Man. In all 1455 objects are described. 294 plates of drawings are added. The Ta kuan Pen ts'ao is still extant, but I have not come across it. Klaproth was in possession of the first book of it. See Catalogue des livres (chinois etc.) de Klaproth No. 144, and Szechuan shu 103, fol. 35. Klaproth's edition was of 1469 A.D.\n27.

He was a native of \u6649\u5dde I chou (Chihli province) and wrote several other medical treatises.16\n\n29. The \u7528\u85e5\u6cd5\u8c61 Yung yao fa siang, one book, on the use of drugs, by \u674e\u679c Li Kao, a celebrated physician of Chen ting (Chihli). Literary appellation: \u660e\u4e4b\u81ea Ming chi tse'. He is more generally known by his pseudonym \u6771\u57a3 Tung yu\u00e1n and flourished in the 12th and 13th centuries. He was a pupil of Kie ku (see 28), and is the author of many other medical treatises. See alph. list 222, 414, 612, 616, 737, and his biography, Yuan shi 203.\n\n30.

The \u672c\u8349\u64ae\u62ec Pen ts'ao ko kua. Judging from the title it seems to be a Materia medica arranged in verses. The author of it was \u80e1\u4ed5 Hu Shi, a physician of the Mongol period.\n\n---\n\n16 He is not to be confounded with a famous physician of the same name, Chang Kie ku, also a native of North-China, who lived during the Ming dynasty.

THE \u690d\u7269\u672c\u8349 KIU HUANG PEN TS'AO.\n\nThis is a treatise on the plants fit for supporting life in time of scarcity by \u5468\u5b9a\u738b Chou ting wang (literary appellation \u6731\u6b0a Chu xiao; pseudonym \u9806\u6148 Ch'eng chai), an Imperial Prince, the fifth son of the first Ming Emperor Hung Wu, who reigned A.D. 1368\u20141398. See Ming shi 116, Biographies of the Imperial princes. Chou ting wang is noticed there as the author of the above work. But the author of the Pen ts'ao kang mu attributes the authorship to \u5468\u61b2\u738b Chou hien wang, who was a son of Chou ting wang. As the great Catalogue Ss' k'u ts'\u00fcan shu explains, C. II. 8, this error arose from the circumstance that Chou ting wang's name does not appear in the original edition.\n\nWe learn from Chou ting wang's biography that he dwelt for a long time, from 1382 to about 1400, in K'ai feng fu (Honan), where his appanages were situated; and then removed to the province of Y\u00fcn nan. He died in 1425; his son Chou hien wang in 1439.\n\nChou ting wang, who is also known as the author of several writings on medical subjects (see alph. list 642, 703), took a great interest in botany and made special study of the wild and cultivated plants suitable for food; his information on the subject having chiefly been derived from the experience of peasants and farmers. The original edition of the Kiu huang pen ts'ao was first published in the beginning of the 16th century, in 2 books;\na second edition in 4 books, the one now current, appeared in 1559 with a preface by Lu tung. This edition was in the possession of Klaproth (see the catalogue of his Chinese and other books No. 146). It was reprinted at the end of the well-known Thesaurus of Agriculture, the Nung ch'eng ts'ian shu, of which we shall speak further on.\n\nThe Kiu huang pen ts'ao is not a simple compilation from earlier treatises, but for the greater part an original work based upon the author's own experience. As his principal abode was in K'ai feng fu, all the plants recorded in his treatise belong to the Flora of Honan, or are cultivated there. The districts and mountains mentioned in it are generally situated south of the Yellow River, and west and south-west of K'ai feng fu. The name of the district of Mi (hien) occurs frequently, and also that of Hui (hien), which is north of the Yellow River. The province of Honan seems to be very rich in interesting plants, especially mountain plants, drugs, but has never been explored by western botanical collectors.\n\nThe Kiu huang pen ts'ao describes in all 414 plants, 138 of which were recorded in previous works on Materia medica, 276 being new. The matter is arranged in five classes, viz.: Herbs, Trees, Cereals, Fruits, and Vegetables. Each plant is represented by an original drawing. As far as I can judge from the plants known to me these drawings are tolerably true to nature. It must not be forgotten that the original wood-cuts date from a time when engravings on wood were altogether unknown in Europe. Many of the delineations in this Chinese work are certainly superior to some European wood-cuts of the 17th century, as, for instance, those in Bontius' Hist. nat. Indic orient. 1629.\n\nAmong the plants depicted and described in the ancient Chinese treatise the following can be ascertained. I enumerate them in the order followed in the Kiu huang pen ts'ao, grouping the species according to the parts of the plant used for food.\n\n---\n\n16 According to E. Meyer's Geschichte der Botanik, IV, 278, the earliest European wood-cuts representing plants are found in Conrad von Megenberg's Buch der Natur, the first edition of which was printed in Augsburg, in 1475.\nA.

The \u98df\u7269\u672c\u8349 Shi wu pen ts'ao, in 2 books, by \u6c6a\u9f0e Wang Ying, a native of Kiang ling (King chou fu, Hupei), prefect of Kiu kiang during the Ming. It was published in the beginning of the 16th century and is based upon a previous work\nby Lu Ho: On the substances employed for food. About Lu Ho see list of works 857.\n\n39.

THE PEN TS'AO KANG MU.\n\nThis celebrated Chinese Materia medica, written more than 300 years ago, which we are now about to review, is well known also in Europe. Translations from it have frequently been published by European sinologues. It forms the type of all the Chinese productions of this class, is held in high esteem by the Chinese, and represents indeed the most important native work on Materia medica and Natural History. It is the first treatise of this kind in which the matter is more critically treated.\n\nLi Shi chen, the famous author of the Pen ts'ao kang mu, was born at K'i chou in Hu pei, probably in the first quarter of the 16th century, and died towards the close of the same century. His literary name was Tung pi. He wrote also under the pseudonym of Pin hu. As was the case with the majority of the early Chinese physicians of note, Li Shi chen was not a professional medical man, but a civil functionary and magistrate of the district of Peng k'i (T'ung\n\n---\n\n17 There is another treatise with the same title by Hu Wen hua, also of the Ming period. See the catalogue Hui k'o shu mu II, 37.\nBesides his principal work, the Pen ts'ao kang mu, he left several medical treatises mentioned in the catalogue Sz' k'u ts'ian shu ming mu lu X, 17, 18. See also alph. list 218, 916, and Li Shi chen's biography, Ming shi 299.\n\nLi Shi chen began the compilation of the Pen ts'ao kang mu in 1552, and after 26 years' labour he completed it in 1578. He wrote out the manuscript three times before he was satisfied to give it out as complete. The author died before it was published, and his son Li Kien yilan presented the manuscript to the Emperor, in 1596, who ordered it to be printed. Several editions have successively been issued. The earliest now extant is, it seems, that of Shun chi 16 (A.D. 1658). All editions which I have had an opportunity of examining are printed on indifferent paper and are full of misprints, which make the book very inconvenient for reference. The original edition of the Pen ts'ao kang mu was headed by a preface from the pen of Wang Shi chen, and dated 1590. It is followed by another preface by Li Shi chen's son, dated 1596, and after this by a general index of the 52 books (chapters) of the work, enumerating the 16 divisions and the 62 classes under which the whole matter is arranged.\n\nWe find next two books of pictorial illustrations which, it would appear, have been borrowed from previous works. These wood-cuts, amounting in number to more than 1100, represent minerals, plants, and animals. But they are so rude that it is very seldom that any conclusion can be drawn from them.\n\nThe first chapter is taken up with a list of the works and authors, from whom extracts have been made by Li Shi chen for the compilation of the Pen ts'ao kang mu. It begins with a critical review of the 42 capital works on Materia medica published at different times, and then gives a dry list of medical authors and works, and miscellaneous historical, geographical, and other publications, 950 in number. I shall speak more in detail of this list in another chapter.\n\nThe next chapter is devoted to introductory observations on\n\n---\n\n18 Previously he had been Offerer of Sacrifices at the Court of one of the Imperial princes (\u695a\u738b\u5e9c\u5949\u7960).\nMateria medica, the nature and properties of medicines, and to general directions for their prescription. The Chinese system of Pharmacology is explained in this chapter. Many quotations from the early writers on the subject are given, illustrating the views entertained up to the present time by the Chinese on the medical virtues of drugs.\n\nThe 3rd and 4th chapters comprehend an enumeration of the various diseases, and the medicines suitable for their treatment (\u767e\u75c5\u4e3b\u6cbb\u85e5).\n\nThe rest of the Pen ts'ao kang mu, chapters 5\u201452, is occupied by accounts of drugs and natural objects, and their use as medicines. These are arranged under 16 \u90e8 pu or divisions, and 62 \u982d lei or classes, which comprise in all 1892 \u7a2e chung or species. 374 of the latter are recorded for the first time by Li Shi chen. 8160 prescriptions are given in connection with these drugs.\n\nThe 16 pu or divisions are:\n\nA. Inanimate substances.\n   1. Water.\n   2. Fire.\n   3. Earth.\n   4. Metals and Stones. { Chap. 5\u201411.\n\nB. Plants. Chap. 12\u201436.\n   1. Herbs.\n   2. Grains.\n   3. Vegetables.\n   4.

Miscellaneous trees. 27 species.\nThe Pen ts'ao kang mu being properly a Materia medica, the greater part of its chapters, devoted apparently to natural history, is filled with medical discussions and prescriptions; the notices regarding the habits, form and locality of natural products, and their application for economic purposes, the only items which have any interest for us, are merely appendages to them.\n\nLi Shi chen, in treating of the several kinds of natural objects, minerals, plants, animals, etc., follows in every case the same system. Each drug is headed by its most common name, written in large characters. The names of the authors and works quoted are for the most part in brackets. The matter relating to each article is divided into paragraphs. The first contains the name and the synonyms of the plant, indicating the works where these names first occur. The second, \u85e5\u540d (explanation of names), gives the etymology of the names. In the third, \u7d20\u89e3, we find, besides the botanical description, statements regarding the history and the native locality of the plant, its use for economical or industrial purposes, and other particulars of interest. In some cases, under the heading \u6b63\u8aa4, there are corrections of errors and instructions for preventing the improper use of the article as a medicine. In the fourth paragraph, \u4fee\u6cbb, the mode of preparing the officinal parts of the plant for medical use is detailed. In the fifth, \u6c23\u5473, taste and smell, the qualities of the air and the nature of the drug are noticed. It is also stated here whether\n\n21 According to the ancient Materia medica of Shen nung the \u56db\u6c23 \u56db\u6c23 are the four conditions of temperature, according to which the drugs have the properties of\n\n\u5bd2 \u51b7, cold\n\n\u71b1 \u71b1, heat\n\n\u6eab \u6e29, warmth\n\n\u51c9 \u9177, coolness.\n\nBut other ancient medical authorities understand by \u56db\u6c23 the four smells. K'ou tsung shi (13th century) observes that cold, heat, warmth and coolness are properly the \u56db\u6027 \u56db\u6027, or four natures. The four smells are the following:\n\n\u9999 \u9999, fragrant\n\n\u81ed \u81ed, fetid\n\n\u8165 \u8165, frouzy (?)\n\n\u81ca \u81ed, rank (?).\n\nThe following examples are adduced:\n\nGypsum is considered a drug of a cold nature; Cassia-bark is hot; Pinellia tuberifera is warm; Peppermint is cool.\n\nFragrant smell: Aloe-wood, Sandal-wood, Camphor, Musk.\n\nFetid smell: Garlic, Asafoetida.\n\nFrouzy smell: Fowls, Fish, Ducks, Snakes.\n\nRank smell: Foxes, Human excrement.\nthe drug possesses poisonous properties or not. In the sixth paragraph, \u738b\u6cbb, masterly operations, the specific virtues of the drug as a medicine are enumerated. In the seventh, \u8457\u660e, is given a clear exposition of its uses. In the eighth, \u96a8\u65b9, there is a list of recipes, with the names of the maladies for which the drug is used as a remedy.\n\nIt may be well to say here a few words on Chinese names of Plants. These names consist generally of one character, but frequently of two or three characters. 15 out of the 214 Radicals under which all the Chinese characters are grouped in Chinese dictionaries, denote plants or parts of them; and their combinations with other characters form the greatest part of the names of plants occurring in Chinese books. These botanical radicals are:\n\n\u8278 or \u8349 ts'ao, Herb (140). This has 1423 combinations. For instance: \u82b1 ai, Artemisia; \u8336 ming, the book name of Tea; \u83ca ts'ien, Rubia cordifolia.\n\n\u6728 mu, Wood (75).\u20141232 combinations. The names of most trees are to be found under this radical.\u2014\u67a4 tso, Oak; \u699b chen, Hazelnut.\n\nThe radical \u7c73 ho, Paddy, Corn (115), \u7c73 mi, Rice, (119), \u9ea5 mai, Wheat (109), and \u7a40 shu, Millet (202), and their combinations, form the names of most kinds of corn. For instance: \u7a3b tao, Rice; \u7a40 su, a kind of Millet; \u9ea5 mou, Barley.\n\nThe radical \u846b hua (07) and its compositions relate almost exclusively to Cucurbitaceous Plants, Cucumbers, Melons, Gourds; whilst the radical \u8c46 tou (161) is appropriated to Leguminous Plants.\n\nThe radical \u9ebb ma (202) denotes Hemp; the radical \u7af9 chu (118) Bamboo; the radical \u8471 kiu, Leeks; the radical \u652f chi, Branch; the radical \u8584 ch'ang, Fragrant Herbs.\n\nAs has been stated, each plant is usually denoted by a peculiar character; e.g. \u679c shi, Diospyros Kaki; \u8349 k'ien, Euryale ferox;\n\n---\n\nThe Shen nung Pen ts'ao king enumerates also the \u4e94\u5473 wu wei, or five tastes of drugs, viz.:\n\n\u9178 suan, sour.\n\u9e79 xian, salt.\n\u7518 gan, sweet.\n\u82e6 ku, bitter.\n\u8f9b sin, pungent.\n\u8336 ch'a, Tea. The Jujube is denoted by the character \u8336 tsoo, which is formed by two characters \u679c ts'z', meaning thorn. It is, as the Pen ta'no kang mu explains, on account of the prickled appearance of the tree.\n\nThe plants, which enjoy a great renown for their utility, have even peculiar characters for their distinct parts. According to the ancient dictionary Rh ya (see above) the root of Nelumbium speciosum is called \u85e4 ou\u2014the leaves and the stalks together \u8377 ho\u2014the stalk \u8475 kia\u2014the lower part of the stalk, being in the mud, \u8475 mi\u2014the leaf \u82b1 hia\u2014the bud of the flower \u82b1 t'an\u2014the seeds with the spongy testa \u9054 lian\u2014the white seed without the testa \u8475 ti\u2014the cotyledons with the plumule within the seed \u9054 i. As is known the common name of this plant is \u9054\u82b1 lian hua.\n\nThe male plant of the common hemp, Cannabis sativa, \u9ebb ma, is designated by the character \u9ebb si; whilst the female (seed bearing) plant is \u76f4 ts'\u00fc.\n\nThe characters which express the name often relate to the appearance of the plant, its properties, etc. Thus Physalis Alkekengi, the winter-cherry, is \u7d05\u59d1\u5a18 hung ku niang, red girl, on account of the red leafy bladder which encloses the ripe fruit.\u2014Celosia cristata, Cockscomb, bears a name of the same meaning in China, \u9e21\u51a0 ki kwan.\u2014Arachis hypogaea, the ground-nut, is called \u843d\u82b1\u751f lo hua sheng (the flowers fall down and grow), as its Greek specific name also denotes; the fruit growing (seemingly) in the ground. After the fall of the flower the fruit curves downwards and the pod ripens in the ground.\u2014The Chimonanthus fragrans is termed \u6885 la mei, prunus of the 12th month, for in China its flowers appear in winter.\u2014On account of the early appearance of its flowers in spring, Jasminum nudiflorum is called \u8fce\u6625\u82b1 ying ch'un hua (flowers which go to meet the spring).\u2014Lilium tigrinum bears the Chinese name \u767e\u5408 po ke (hundred together), owing to the numerous scales which form the bulb. This bulb is largely used for food in China.\u2014The common name of Euryale ferox is \u9e7f\u5934 hi tou (fowl's head). Anybody who has seen the fruit of this plant will agree that the Chinese name is very significative.\u2014The name of \u7d2b\u82b1\u6811 jung hua shu (silk-\nflower tree) is applied to Albizzia Julibrissin. The latter specific name is a corruption of the Persian gul i abreskum, meaning also silk-flower. This name is given on account of the silky appearance of the long stamens.\n\nThere are in China a considerable number of cultivated plants which have been introduced from foreign countries, especially from India, Central and Western Asia. The Chinese have often tried to render the foreign names of these plants by Chinese sounds. The Pen ts'ao kang mu frequently quotes Sanscrit names (\u68b5\u68b5\u68b5). Thus the \u6a1f\u6728 lo is the Shorea robusta, sal or salia in Sanscrit. Buddha is said to have died under a Sal tree, for which reason the tree is also styled \u5929\u5e2b\u679c tien shi li (Chestnut of the heavenly preceptor). But as there are no Sal trees in China the Buddhist priests in the temples usually cultivate Aesculus chinensis under the above names.\u2014The Sanscrit name of Sandalwood, chandana, is rendered in the Pen ts'ao kang mu by the sounds \u6a80\u6a80 chen tan.\u2014The Jack-fruit, Artocarpus integrifolia, is termed \u6ce2\u7f85\u871c po lo mi in Chinese. This is evidently a transcription of the Sanscrit paramita, excellent.\u2014The Pen ts'ao kang mu speaks of a Western Asiatic plant \u85cf\u6cd5\u90ce sa fa lang, and the particulars given about this plant leave no doubt that Saffron is meant.\n\nThe plant \u80e1\u8606\u5df4 ku lu pa, cultivated in China and said to be of foreign origin, is apparently Trigonella foenum graecum, kulba in Arabic.\n\nThe descriptive details of plants as found in the Pen ts'ao kang mu and other treatises of this class are generally meagre and unsatisfactory. The time of flowering and the colour of the flowers are always noted; but the other particulars are insufficient, because the Chinese, in speaking of the parts and organs of plants, have no botanical terminology, the leaves, flowers, fruits, etc. being described by comparison with the same organs of other Chinese plants, frequently unknown to European readers. This was however also the mode of describing plants adopted by the celebrated Dioscorides (first century of our era), and followed by our\n\n---\n\n22 At least in Japan the above Chinese name is applied to a variety of Tr. foenum graecum. Franch. Sav. Enum. pl. japon. I. 95.\u2014So no kou XIV. 18, 19.\nbotanists down to the time of Linnseus. Comp. e.g. Plukenet's Amaltheum botan. 1705.\n\nThe descriptions of plants given by Li Shi chen consist for the most part of successive quotations from authors of various times, and in this regard again present an analogy to the treatises on Materia medica of early Western authors. See for instance Ebn Baithar's (13th century) great work on Medicines and Aliments (German translation by Sontheimer, 1840). Finally Li Shi chen gives also his own opinion on the subject treated of; and it may be said that his view is generally the most reasonable of all.\n\nThe Chinese possess very little talent for observation, or zeal for truth, the principal requirements of the naturalist. The Chinese style is inaccurate and often ambiguous. In addition to this they have an inclination to the marvellous, and their opinions and conclusions are frequently puerile. But notwithstanding these deficiencies, met also in all the other branches of Chinese literature, their works on botany, if critically studied and rightly understood and appreciated, will be found to be replete with interest, and to present much valuable information, especially in elucidating the history of cultivated species. These treatises have no less claim to be translated into European languages and to be commented upon than the works of Theophrastus, Dioscorides, and Plinius.\n\nLet me now consider the difficulties which the student of the Pen ts'ao kang mu must overcome in order to understand clearly the information furnished in this and other Chinese botanical works.\n\nThe first difficulty that arises is to find out where to look for the plant about which information is required. Chinese botanical works note from 5000 to 6000 names of plants, the synonyms of each plant being for the most part numerous. The Chinese have nothing similar to the alphabetical indexes of our comprehensive works. I have therefore been obliged to draw up for the convenience of my own studies alphabetical indexes of all Chinese names of plants and synonyms, according to the sounds of the Chinese characters, not only for the Pen ts'ao kang mu, but also for the other more important Chinese treatises on Botany.\n\nIt cannot be said that the style of Chinese writers on botanical\nmatters presents difficulties to European readers acquainted in some degree with the language. In describing plants the authors use for the most part always the same terms. The chief obstacles encountered by European inquirers studying these writings will be found to consist in the right interpretation of geographical names which occur, and in ascertaining the time when the quoted works were composed. The satisfactory elucidation of these important questions requires extensive preliminary studies in Chinese Geography, especially Historical Geography, and Bibliography. I need hardly say that for investigations of this kind very little assistance can be expected from our Chinese teachers, whose erudition seldom extends beyond the classics.\n\nLi Shi chen compiled the Pen ts'ao kang mu from about 1000 ancient and more recent works, not only medical and botanical, but also historical, geographical, philosophical, poetical, etc. As I have stated above the author gives a dry list of these works without other explanation; and in mentioning works or authors he never gives the whole title, but frequently only one character of the author's name is quoted. In consulting the Pen ts'ao we meet frequently in brackets with the characters \u6851\u66f0 (Sung says). The character sung means properly a eulogy, but here it denotes the author \u8607\u66f0 Su Sung, who wrote the T'ien king pen ts'ao (see above No. 24). More examples of this kind, quoted from the Pen ts'ao, will be found in another chapter of this paper, where I shall give an alphabetical list of works and authors appearing in that treatise.\n\nOn a previous page we have already drawn attention to the importance for our investigations of knowing the time when the quoted works were written. We may add here that this question must be also elucidated for the purpose of determining the localities mentioned in Chinese botanical writings. At all times the Chinese have endeavoured to complicate all branches of their knowledge, so that they themselves do not find their way easily. They seem to place the value of their sciences in this intricacy. It is known that from ancient times each of the Chinese Emperors bore, besides his dynastic name, a name for his reign, and this latter was often changed. There are Emperors who are registered in history with from 10 to 15 names, each composed of at least\ntwo characters. The Chinese authors, in citing dates, refer to these reign-names of the Emperors, which correspond to our ciphers, to designate the dates. In the same manner the Chinese have at all times liked to change the names of their provinces, cities, etc. Almost every dynasty, on succeeding to the throne, has changed the names of most of the cities and also of the provinces of China. Thus every city has borne different names at different periods. But as the number of characters to designate geographical names is limited, and as certain characters are particularly in favour for names of departments or districts, it happens very often that one geographical name is applied to a great number of places. For instance \u897f\u5e73 Si ping is now-a-days the name of a district in the province of Honan. At the time of the Han it was the name of a district in the present Anhui; at the time of the Tsin a district in Kansu. During different periods of Chinese history the same name was applied to districts in Y\u00fcn nan, Sz\u2019 ch\u2019\u00fcan, and Hu pei.\u2014\u6c38\u660c Yung ch\u2019ang, now-a-days a prefecture in Y\u00fcn nan, has borne this name since the 5th century. During the Mongol period the same name was given to a prefecture in the province of Kansu. There are several other cities in China which at different times have borne the name of Yung ch\u2019ang.\n\n\u2014The name of a province \u6c5f\u5357 Kiang nan (the two characters meaning south of the river) occurs frequently in the pages of the Pen ts\u2019ao. Here it does not mean the country south of the Yellow River, so called under the present dynasty (provinces of Anhui and Kiang su), but it is to be understood as the Kiang nan province of the T\u2019ang dynasty, south of the Yang tsz\u2019 kiang, comprising the greatest part of the modern provinces of Fukien and Kiang si.\u2014In like manner the province of \u6cb3\u5357 Ho nan of the T\u2019ang period does not correspond to the province of this name to-day, for it occupied the greater part of the modern Shan tang. Ho nan likewise means south of the river, but here the Yellow River is intended, which then emptied itself into the Gulf of Pechili, as it has done for some thirty years past.\u2014The name \u5357\u6d77 Nan hai (Southern Sea) referred in ancient times to the Eastern part of the modern Kuang tung province, but sometimes the Chinese also understand by this name the Archipelago and the Indian Ocean.\nIt is clear that the greatest geographical errors can be committed by the reader unacquainted with the time at which the respective Chinese author, referring to names of countries and places, wrote. In the year 1842 E. Biot published a useful book, *Dictionnaire des noms anciens et modernes des Villes etc. dans l'Empire Chinois*. It is translated from the \u5eb7\u8f3f\u8a18 Kuang yu ki, a small geographical account of the Empire, and arranged in alphabetical order; but it proves to be insufficient for determining the geographical names occurring in the Pen ts'ao. As far as only the names of Chinese cities at different times are concerned I would recommend for reference a very complete Chinese Geographical Dictionary, the \u6b77\u4ee3\u5730\u7406\u5fd7\u7de8\u8f2f\u4eca\u91cb Li tai ti li chi yin pien kin shi, in 20 books, published in 1837. The names of Chinese cities, ancient and modern, are arranged in it according to a Chinese system under about 1600 characters. It is not quite easy to find a name in this book, but by arranging these 1600 characters according to the radicals (as I have done for my own use) it can be made more practicable for consultation. But in this work we find only ancient and modern names of Chinese departments and districts, whilst ancient Chinese writers on botany in giving the stations of plants frequently mention provinces, the names of which have also been repeatedly changed in course of time. This want is in some degree met by the new edition of the Li tai ti li chi, etc., published in 1872, by \u674e\u9d3b\u7ae0 Li Hung chang, the well-known Viceroy of Chihi. In this edition a series of historical maps referring to the political divisions of China under the different dynasties has been added. More detailed information on the subject may be found in an elaborate compilation of historical maps of China, which came to light in 1879 (Tung hu hien, Hu pei) with the title \u6b77\u4ee3\u8f3f\u5730\u6cbf\u9769\u5716\u96c6 Li tai yu ti yen ko hien yao t'u. It comprises 68 maps drawn up according to the geographical sections in the Dynastic Histories.\n\nIn the Pen ts'ao occur also frequently names of ancient countries not included in China. These must be sought for in the Histories of the various Chinese Dynasties, which generally contain at the end notices of foreign countries.\nTHE \u5eb7\u82b3\u8c31 KUANG K'UN FANG PU.\n\nThis work, the Chinese title of which may be translated: Enlarged Thesaurus of Botany, is a very valuable treatise on Botany, dealing with cultivated as well as with wild plants. The original work was published in 1630 under the title of \u82b3\u8c31 K'\u00fcn fang pu, Thesaurus of Botany, in 30 books, by \u738b\u8c61\u664b Wang Siang tsin. In 1708 a revised and enlarged edition was completed and printed by Imperial order with the above title Kuang K'\u00fcn fang pu, in 100 books. This is divided into 11 sections (\u90e8 pu) under the following heads:\n\n1. \u5929\u6642 T'ien shi. The Heavens, the Seasons of the year.\n2. \u7a2e\u7a2e Ku. Grains, Beans.\n3. \u6851\u9ebb Sang ma (literally: Mulberry-tree and Hemp). Textile Plants.\n4. \u852c\u83dc Shu. Vegetables.\n5. \u8336 Ch'a. Tea.\n6. \u82b1 Hua. Flowers.\n7. \u679c Kuo. Fruits.\n8. \u6728 Mu. Trees.\n9. \u7af9 Chu. Bamboos.\n10. \u8349 Hui. Herbs.\n11. \u85e5 Yao. Medicinal Herbs.\n\nThe number of species described in the Kuang K'\u00fcn fang pu amounts to about 1700. It contains much new information not found in the Pen ts'ao, drawn from ancient and later authors. There are no illustrations in it, but its great superiority lies in the splendid type. The matter is treated in much the same way as in other Chinese works of this kind. The author gives first some short original account of each plant, which is followed by a series of quotations from authors and works of various times on the subject. These quotations are arranged under three heads, printed in white characters on black ground, and numerous subdivisions, in brackets, as also the names of works and authors quoted.\n\n1. \u5178\u8457 Hui k'ao. Under this head are comprised quotations from the Classics, Historics of the Dynasties, Biographies, the\nworks of the Chinese philosophers, Geographical works, Descriptions of the Chinese provinces, departments, etc. The time of these publications is never given, nor are the quotations arranged chronologically.\n\n2. \u7d20\u96c5 Tsi tao. Fine composition, elegant writing. Under this head, which comprises the greater part of the extracts given, we meet with quotations from a great number of poetical compositions. The matter is arranged in chronological order, and the dynasties during which the quoted authors wrote are always indicated. For the headings of the numerous subdivisions under which the quotations appear see Mr. Wylie's Notes on Chinese Literature, p. 188\u2014192, where the various forms of Chinese poetry are detailed.\n\n3. \u5225\u9304 Piu hu. This comprises principally quotations from authors on agriculture and on the economic use of plants.\n\nThe characters \u8a18\u548c\u8a18, likewise printed white on black ground, indicate, the first the original matter of the K'un fang pu, the second the additional information given in the Kuang K'un fang pu.\n\nTHE BOTANICAL SECTION OF THE \u5716\u66f8\u96c6\u6210 T'U SHU TSI CH'ENG.\n\nEighteen years after the publication of the Kuang K'un fang pu, in 1726, the vast Compendium of Chinese Literature known under the above name, was drawn up under Imperial authority.\n\nThe Botanical Section of this gigantic compilation, \u8349\u6728\u5178 Ts'ao mu tien, comprises 320 books. As it exists in the library of the Russian Legation at Peking, I have had ample opportunity\n\n---\n\n23 This term is not to be confounded with the Piu hu frequently quoted in the Pen tao. As we have seen above (No. 7) this is the abbreviated title of an ancient Materia medica.\n\n24 Readers who are desirous of further information about this magnificent work may find it in W. F. Mayers' paper: Bibliography of the Chinese Imperial Collections of Literature, the last publication from the able pen of this distinguished and lamented scholar. It appeared in Vol. VI of the China Review, 1878. On p. 216 the author gives a review of the T'u shu tai cheng, or as its full title reads \u53e4\u4eca\u5716\u66f8\u96c6\u6210 Ku kin T'u shu tai cheng, i.e. Compendium of Literature and Illustrations, Ancient and Modern. A complete copy of the work was acquired in 1878 by the British Museum. The Great Library at Paris is said to possess some portions of it.\nof referring to it. It has a good claim to be regarded as the most complete collection of Chinese records on botanical matters extant, and its having been printed with large moveable copper types on excellent paper renders it especially useful for reference. A great number of rare or now lost ancient botanical records and treatises on agriculture have been reproduced in it; and the whole matter of the Pen ts'ao kang mu, cleared from mistakes, is also found there. The pictorial illustrations accompanying the accounts of the various plants seem to have been drawn from all available sources in previous Chinese pictorial works on botany. They are much better than those in the Pen ts'ao, but with a few exceptions they have no great value. Some of them can be traced to the Kiu huang pen ts'ao (see above No. 35).\n\nThe matter under each plant is invariably arranged in the following order\u2014not very intelligible to European minds.\n\n1. Under the head of \u85e5\u66f8 Hui k'ao the respective text of the principal works on Materia medica, Botany, Agriculture, Horticulture, etc. are reproduced, and generally in extenso, for each plant.\n\n2. The head of \u85e5\u6587 I wen deals with literary compositions, poetical works, etc. in which plants are mentioned.\n\n3. \u9078\u53e5 Shian ku. Elegant extracts.\n\n4. \u7d00\u4e8b Ki shi. Minor historical notices.\n\n5. \u96dc\u9304 Tsa lu. Miscellaneous notes.\n\n6. \u5916\u7bc7 Wai pien. Appendices.\n\nPlants in the T'u shu tsi ch'eng are treated in 700 \u90e8 pu (divisions). It is to be regretted that the time of publication of the quoted works is only given in the case of the literary compositions and poems, although the reason for this omission is not apparent. As regards the quotations under the other heads neither the time is noticed, nor are they chronologically arranged according to date of publication.\n\nTHE \u690d\u7269\u540d\u5be6\u5716\u8003 CHI WU MING SHI T'U K'AO.\n\nThis, the most recent work of note on Chinese Botany, and especially remarkable for its drawings, was published in 1848.\nIt has much attracted the attention of European botanists and sinologues in China, and is now to be found, I think, in all the great libraries of Europe.\n\nWu K'ei-sun, the author of this elaborate botanical work, was a scholar and functionary of high distinction during the present dynasty. He was a native of Ku shi hien, in Southern Honan. His literary name was Yu chen, but in his work he generally styles himself Yu lou xung, the husbandman of Yu lou. He entered public life in 1817. After taking his degree as first-class graduate he commenced his career as Han lin compiler. In 1819 he was appointed Chief Examiner in Kuang tung. In 1831 he entered the Imperial College of Inscriptions; in 1832 he was sent to the province of Hu pei as Provincial Director of Education; and in 1834 he returned to Peking where he successively held several high offices (Director of the State Ceremonial, Sub-Chancellor of the Grand Secretariat, Vice-President of the Board of Rites). In 1837 he was appointed Provincial Director of Education in Kiang si, and in 1838 Provincial Examiner in Che kiang. Subsequently we find him again in the capital as Senior Vice-President of the Board of War, and a year later he held the same office in the Board of Revenue. In 1840 he had risen to be Acting Governor General of Hu kuang, and in the same year he was made Governor of Hunan. In 1842 he fought successfully against the rebels in his province, and soon after this fell ill. In 1843 he was transferred as Governor to Che kiang, and in the same year appointed Governor of Y\u00fcn nan. He subsequently administered the provinces of Y\u00fcn nan and Kwei chou as Acting Governor General, but in 1845 he was again removed and transferred to Fu kien as Governor. Soon after he held the same office in Shansi. In 1846\n\n---\n\n25 I have myself procured at different times in Peking several copies of it, which were sent to London, Paris, Berlin, the United States of America, etc. Fifteen years ago its price in Peking was $18, but now it can hardly be obtained here for less than $30, although it is not a very rare book.\n\n26 The biographical details here presented are drawn from a memorandum compiled from official sources and communicated to one of my friends in Peking by an officer of the Tsang li ya men.\n\n27 Yu lou is an ancient name of a district in the province of An hui (Lu kiang hien).\nhe was again attacked by illness and allowed to retire from his public duties. He died a short time afterwards. The Emperor gave him a posthumous title.\n\nIt appears from this dry curriculum vitae that Wu K'i shun displayed great activity in his public life. The opportunity he had of making himself acquainted with many provinces of the Empire qualified him to investigate the Chinese Flora. It is however not easily understood how he found leisure to prosecute his favourite studies and to write an extensive work on Botany, illustrated with a large number of drawings.\n\nThe Chi wu ming shi t'u k'ao is generally in 8 tomes (t'ao). One-half of them, 4 t'ao or 22 (rather voluminous) books, comprise the descriptive portion of the work, and are styled Chang pien by the author. They contain accounts of plants compiled as usual from previous authors, but Wu K'i shun introduces also a good deal of new and interesting matter not found in the Kuang K'un fang p'u or the T'u shu ts: ch'eng.\n\nThe second part, in 38 books, forming also 4 t'ao, is devoted to pictorial illustrations of plants accompanied with short, sometimes also detailed descriptions. These drawings, nearly 1800 in number, are tolerably well executed, especially those delineated by the author himself, apparently from nature. One part of the engravings can be traced to the Kiu huang pen ts'ao (see above No.35). Although the wood-cuts in the Chi wu ming shi t'u k'ao cannot be compared, as far as scientific accuracy in delineation is concerned, with those of some Japanese botanical works (of which I shall speak further on), it is undoubtedly the best Chinese pictorial work of this class, and entitled to special attention on the part of students of Chinese Botany.\n\nThe Chi wu ming etc. was revised and published, it seems soon after the death of the author, by Lu Ying ku, a native of the province of Y\u00fcn nan, who wrote also the preface, which is dated T'ai y\u00fcan fu (Shansi) 1848. He states that Wu K'i shun, having held public offices in different parts of the Empire, had many opportunities of making observations with respect to plants, and of comparing his own experiences with the statements of previous authors. He had at an earlier period composed the first\npart of the work, the Chang pien, but subsequently was induced to draw up the second or supplementary part, accompanied with drawings, in which the author endeavoured to give the results of his personal observations.\n\nAmong the works and authors frequently quoted by Wu K'i sun I may notice the Kin huang pen ts'ao (see above),\u2014the \u82b1\u93e1 Hua king, published 1688,\u2014the \u5357\u8d8a\u7b46\u8a18 Nan y\u00fce pi ki, an account of the Southern provinces of China, written during the present dynasty,\u2014the \u6f22\u5357\u672c\u8349 Tien nan pen ts'ao, a Herbal of the province of Y\u00fcn nan (unknown to me).\n\nWith this my sketch of the History of Chinese Materia medica and Botany may be brought to a close. I have reviewed only the more important works of this class. Chinese writings on plants are very numerous, both general treatises and monographs on particular plants. These will be shortly noticed in another chapter devoted to Bibliography.\n\n2. Chinese Works on Agriculture.\n\nThe primeval Emperor Shen nung, whom the Chinese believe to have composed the first treatise on Materia medica, is also credited with having laid the foundation of Chinese Husbandry. His name implies this tradition, for Shen nung means: the Divine Husbandman. It is related in the early records that the people of his age were rude and wholly unacquainted with the advantages of agriculture. They subsisted on fruit, vegetables, and the flesh of birds and beasts. Shen nung examined first the quality of the soil, fashioned timber into ploughs and taught the people how to till the ground and raise grain. On a previous page I referred to the mountain in Shan si, where tradition makes him first teach his people the fundamental processes of agriculture. Ss' ma Ts'ien (B. C. 163\u201485) records in the Shi ki (book 1) that Shen nung sowed the five kinds (\u7a2e\u4e94\u7a40).\u2014\u771f\u7384 Cheng huan, a celebrated scholar of the Han dynasty, A.D. 127\u2014200, explains that the five kinds of cereals, the \u4e94\u7a40 wu ku, are meant, namely: \u7a3b tao (Rice), \u9ea5 mai (Wheat), \u7ce0 liang (Panicum italicum).\nshu (Panicum miliaceum), and \u8349 shu (Soja bean). The same are also mentioned in the Classics.\n\nIt is known that at the time of the vernal equinox the ceremony of ploughing the soil and sowing the five kinds of corn is performed by the Emperor, assisted by the Imperial Princes and the Presidents of the Boards. According to the \u5927\u6e05\u6703\u5178\u4e8b\u4f8b Ta Ts'ing hui tien shi li, the great work on the institutes of the government, book 250, 1, where this ceremonial is described, the same cereals are mentioned in connection with it. The Emperor sows the rice, the Princes and the Presidents of the Boards sow the remaining cereals.\n\nShen nung's son \u6842 Chu held the office of \u7a2e\u6b63, Minister of Husbandry. More than 400 years later \u6842 K'i, a son of the Emperor K'yu, filled a similar office. The Emperor Yao, B.C. 2356, made him \u5ee3\u9952, Director of Husbandry. He is more generally known under the name of \u540e\u7a37 Hou ts'i, Sovereign Millet. The house of the Princes of Chou traced their lineage to him. After his decease he became worshipped like Chu as patron of Agriculture (Mayers' Chin. Read. Man. p. 228).\n\nAn interesting sketch of the state of ancient Chinese agriculture during the Chou dynasty has been drawn up by E. Biot from the scattered references to the subject found in the Book of Odes. An English translation of this article is found in Dr. Legge's Shi king, proleg. p. 149.\n\nAs in China agriculture has always been held in the highest estimation, Chinese literature relating to husbandry is represented by a great number of general treatises and monographs on the subject, composed at various times.\n\nTHE \u7a2e\u690d\u66f8 CHUNG CHI SHU.\n\nThis seems to be one of the earliest treatises of this class. The author of it was \u8303\u52dd\u4e4b Fan Sheng chi. In the biographical section of the T'ien Han shu, book 30 (husbandry), will be found a short notice regarding the author. Liu Hiang, the librarian of the Imperial library (first century B.C.) reports that Fan Sheng chi held successively several offices during the reign of Ch'eng Ti, B.C. 32\u20146, and that the Emperor appointed him to teach hus-\nbandry in the prefectures surrounding the capital (Ch'ang an near the present Si an fu in Shensi).\n\nThe work was in 18 sections (pien). Some quotations from it, found in other ancient works, are all that has come down to us of this ancient treatise, the title of which means \"the Book on the Art of Sowing and Planting.\" Extracts from it are given in the Ts'i min yao shu (see the next), but they only refer to the following cultivated plants:\n\nCommon Rice.\nWheat.\nBarley.\nPanicum miliaceum.\nEchinocloa crus galli. Two varieties, still cultivated in North-China, are mentioned, one of them cultivated in water, the other in dry soil.\n\nSoja bean.\nOther leguminous plants.\nLagenaria.\nCommon Hemp.\nCaladium esculentum.\nMulberry-tree.\n\nTHE \u9f4a\u6c11\u8981\u8853 TS'I MIN YAO SHU.\n\nThis title may be translated: Important Rules for the people to gain their living in peace. It is a work on husbandry, still extant, by \u8cc8\u601d\u52f0 Kia Sz' sien (thus the Pen ts'ao, list of works 26, gives the pronunciation of the last character, generally pronounced hie). We learn from the Sz' k'u ts'\u00fcan shu, C. II. 2, that he was a subject of the After Wei (A.D. 386\u2014534) and prefect of \u9ad8\u5e73 Kao p'ing. (Several cities of this name existed during the Wei in different parts of the Empire.) He seems to have lived in the 5th century. The original work was in 92 pien (sections). A part of it was lost a long time ago, and much additional matter by later authors is found in the edition now current, which is in 10 books. It seems that the T'u shu tsi ch'eng reproduces in books V and XV (on planting and felling trees, and cultivating fruits), and under the heads of the respective plants the whole matter of the work, together with the additional notes; but the latter are always separated there from the original text. According to an author of the 12th century, quoted in the Wen hien t'ung k'ao, the edition then extant was already provided with the interpolated notes; and according to \u674e\u9676 Li Tao (also an author of the Sung) these notes had been added by \u6c88\u62ec Sun Kung (Sung dynasty).\nThe work of Kia Ss' niu contains many interesting particulars regarding the cultivation of the cereals, vegetables, fruits, trees, etc., then grown in China. It is also of interest on account of its numerous quotations from previous ancient writings now lost.\n\nThe following plants treated of in the Ts'i min yao shu can be identified:\n\nCommon Rice.\nMountain Rice.\nPanicum miliaceum. (Two varieties still cultivated in China.)\nSetaria italica.\nSorghum vulgare.\nBarley.\nWheat.\nAvena nuda.\nBuckwheat.\nSoja hispida.\nAbrus precatorius?\nRaphanus sativus.\nBrassica Napus.\nBr. chinensis.\nBr. chin. oleifera.\nVarious species of Sinapis still cultivated in China.\nLactuca sativa.\nThlaspi arvense?\nBenincasa cerifera.\nVarious Pumpkins and Gourds still cultivated in China.\nBottle-gourd.\nCucumis sativa.\nSolanum Melongena.\nBatatas edulis.\nCaladium esculentum.\nHydropyrum latifolium.\nAllium sativum.\nA. fistulosum.\nA. odorum.\nOther species of Allium.\nMalva verticillata.\nRehmannia glutinosa.\nMedicago sativa.\nPolygonum orientale.\nPteris aquilina.\nVarious Mushrooms.\nNelumbo speciosum.\nLimnanthemum nymphoides.\nL. peltatum.\nTypha (sprouts eaten).\nSea-weed.\nBignonia grandiflora.\nAkebia quinata.\nRhododendron.\nPoterium officinale.\nCelery.\nCoriandrum sativum.\nPerilla ocimeidea.\nZingiber officinale.\nZ.

The name of its author is \u90ed\u7d22\u99dd Kuo T'o t'o, who seems to have lived in the 7th or 8th century. All that we know of him is found in a short biographical notice written by the poet Liu Tsung y\u00fcn (A.D. 773\u2014819. See alph. list 478), who perhaps was his contemporary. This biography is reproduced in the T'u shu tsai ch'eng, book VI. Kuo T'o t'o was a villager experienced in husbandry. His village was situated in the vicinity of Ch'ang an, the metropolis of China during the T'ang period. His true cognomen is unknown, T'o t'o (Camel) being his pseudonym.\n\nThe T'u shu tsai ch'eng seems to reproduce the whole matter of the Chung shu shu. See books V, X, XV, and under the heads of the respective plants. It would be presumed from the title of the work, which means: the Book on the Art of Planting Trees, that it deals only with trees; but in reality it treats also of cereals, vegetables, and fruits; and gives notices of nearly the same plants as the Ts'i min yao shu. The following are new:\n\n| Phascolus radiatus. | Olea fragrans. |\n|---------------------|----------------|\n| Melons.             | Mandarin-Orange.|\n| Spinach.            | Coolie-Orange.  |\n| Beta vulgaris.      | Other Oranges.  |\n| Papaver Rhoeas.     | Pyrus malus.    |\n| Paeonia Montan.     | Salixbaria adiantifolia. |\n| P. albitora.        | Pinus sinensis. |\n| Jasminum Sambac.    | Lycium chinense.|\n| J. officinale.      |                 |\n\nThe Chung shu shu presents a peculiar interest with respect to some curious accounts found in it regarding the art of grafting trees. It has been asserted that the Jesuit missionaries first taught the Chinese to graft trees (see Chambers' Encycl., article: Grafting). But that is a mistake. Grafting was probably practised in China in early times. The ancient Dictionary Shuo wen, published A.D. 121, explains the character \u6839, even now-a-days\nthe proper term for grafting (sometimes also written \u63a5), by \u7db4\u6728, which can only be translated by grafting. But in Chinese works on husbandry now extant Kuo T'o t'o is the earliest author quoted with respect to grafting.\n\nThe ancient Greek and Roman authors assert that the vine, the fig-tree, the walnut-tree, the olive-tree, the pomegranate and other heterogeneous trees can be grafted together (see Pliny's Natur. hist.). Although in our days no credit is given to these statements, as all attempts of grafting have failed except among plants of the same genus, or at least of the same natural family,\u2014it is a curious fact that in ancient Chinese writings on agriculture we meet with statements similar to those made by Pliny. Kuo T'o t'o asserts, besides the successful grafting of Broussonetia papyrifera on Morus alba (which is not improbable at all), that Plum-trees yielding sour fruits and Pear-trees can be grafted on the Mulberry-tree, and that by this way a sweet plum and a sweet delicate pear are obtained. He states further that Prunus domestica can be grafted on the Peach-tree and vice versa\u2014or the Apricot-tree on the Peach-tree, which causes the apricots to increase in size. A Peach-tree grafted on Diospyros Kaki is said to produce gold-coloured peaches. Finally we are told in that ancient book that the Pomegranate can be successfully grafted on Olea fragrans, and Prunus on Melia Azedarach. I find also there a statement to the effect that if a Vine be planted so close to a Jujube-tree that the roots of both plants come into contact, the grapes will assume the flavour of the jujube. It is remarkable that a sympathy was supposed to exist between the Vine and the Zizyphus Lotus by the gardeners of ancient Babylon. Compare Meyer's Geschichte der Botanik, III, 74, Husbandry of the Nabath\u00e6ans. See also the observations of the Jesuit missionaries in China on the same subject, i.e. on the grafting together of heterogeneous trees by Chinese gardeners (My \"Early Europ. Res. into the Flora of China,\" p. 29, 125 [21, 21]).\n\nThe \u56db\u6642\u7e82\u8981 S\u00ec sh\u00ed zu\u00e0n y\u00e0o. Important Rules for the Four Seasons, in 6 books, is also a production of the T'ang period and frequently quoted in Chinese works on husbandry. The\nWen hien t'ung k'ao, CCXVIII, 3, gives a short bibliographical notice with respect to this work. It is stated there that \u8ed2\u8b6f Han O, the author, in compiling these Rules for Husbandry, made use of all preceding writings on the subject.\n\nThe \u9732\u66f8 Nung shu is a treatise on husbandry in 3 books, written by \u9673\u8fb2 Ch'en Fu, in 1149 A.D. The first part treats of Agriculture, the second of Breeding Cattle, the third of Rearing Silkworms. See Wylie's Notes on Chin. Lit. p. 75. According to the Wen hien t'ung k'ao, CCXVIII, 6, the author was a hermit living in the Western mountains, about the middle of the 12th century.\n\nAnother work with the same title \u9732\u66f8 Nung shu, in 22 books, by \u738b\u690d Wang Chung, was published during the Y\u00fcan period (13th or 14th century). This treats with great minuteness of the details of husbandry, and is illustrated by plates, each accompanied by a stanza of poetry. The first six books, \u9732\u6851\u901a\u8a23 Nung sang t'ung k'\u00fce, consist of general rules for agriculture. This section is frequently quoted in the Kung k'un fang pu and in later works on husbandry, as a separate work. It is followed by the \u6bba\u6a5f Ku pu, on Cereals, 4 books, and then by a series of plates illustrating agricultural implements. See Wylie l.c. p. 76.\n\nWan Cheng also wrote two monographs on Textile plants, both illustrated by plates, viz.:\n\nThe \u6728\u68c9\u5716\u8b5c Hu mien t'u pu, a treatise on the Cotton plant, and\n\nThe \u9ebb\u82e7\u5716\u8b5c Ma Ch'u t'u pu, on Hemp and Grass-cloth plants. This is found reproduced in the Chi wu ming shi t'u k'ao, descr. part IX, 53.\n\n---\n\n28 A third work with the same title appeared in the beginning of the present dynasty. It was compiled by \u5f35\u8fb2\u8a73 Chang Li siang. It is reprinted in the collection Chao tai ts'ung shu (Wylie l.c. 137).\nThe *Nung sang ts'iao*, another work on the Agriculture of the Y\u00fcan period, in seven books, was drawn up by order of Kublai Khan, in 1273. It was then considered a treatise of great importance, and has been several times republished. There are ten divisions on the following subjects: Precepts, Ploughing, Sowing, Planting Mulberry-trees, Rearing Silkworms, Vegetables, Fruits, Bamboo and Forest-trees, Medicinal plants, and Breeding Cattle. (See Wylie l. c. 76.) The preface of the work is by \u738b\u7469 Wang P'ian.\n\nThe *Nung sang i shi tso yao* is a small treatise, in two books, on the same subjects as the preceding, and intended to supplement the information contained in it. It was written in 1314 by \u9f8d\u660e\u5584 Lu ming shan, an Ouigur by birth, and reprinted in 1330 (Wylie l. c. 76).\n\n**THE NUNG CHENG TS'UAN SHU.**\n\nThis work, the title of which may be translated by \"Complete Treatise on Agriculture,\" is one of the most important and interesting works on Chinese husbandry extant. It was written by \u5f90\u5149\u5553 S\u016b Kuang k'i\u2014literary name: \u5143\u5149 Yuan ku; posthumous title: \u6587\u5b9a Wen ting kung,\u2014A. D. 1562\u20141633, a native of \u4e0a\u6d77 Shang hai. See his biography Ming shi 261, and Mayers' Chin. Read. Man. p. 197. S\u016b Kuang k'i was a distinguished scholar and Minister of State during the reign of Ming Wan li. His interest in scientific inquiry brought him in contact with the Jesuit missionaries at Peking, whom he warmly supported. Mention is repeatedly made of S\u016b Kuang k'i in Du Halde's Description de la Chine (III. 76, 79, 82), where he is styled Paul Six, Colao,\" Premier Ministre d'\u00c9tat. His portrait is also given there. He was a friend of Matteo Ricci and was baptized at Nanking. Paul was his Christian name.\n\nThe Nung cheng ts'uan shu is an excellent and elaborate work on Chinese Husbandry, in sixty books, illustrated by numerous plates.

It was compiled by Imperial command and published in 1742, in 78 books. It is well known also in Europe, the great sinologue Stan. Julien having frequently made translations from it. The Shou shi t'ung k'ao, however, is nothing but a compilation, made without much critical judgment, from previous works; and very little original matter is found in it. It seems to me that the Nung cheng ts'\u00fcan shu, reviewed above, has a much higher value in this regard, but the Shou shi t'ung k'ao is important as a vast mine of quotations. The engravings relating to plants are very rude.\n\nA synopsis of the work has been given by Baron (now Marquis) L. d'Hervey de St. Denys in his Recherches sur l'Agriculture et l'Horticulture des Chinois. It is divided into eight sections comprising 78 books.\n\n---\n\n81 The article on Insect wax, and the trees upon which the insects feed, was translated by Stan. Julien.

Chinese Geographical Works containing Botanical Information.\n\nA vast part of native literature is devoted to the Geography of China proper and the adjacent countries. The Chinese are accustomed to give in their topographical works more or less detailed accounts of the Natural productions. Thus in the \u8cc7 \u570b \u7fa9 Y\u00fc kung, already mentioned (see above Shu king), the earliest description of China extant, the productions of the soil are enumerated for each of the nine provinces of the Empire.\n\nThe next General Description of China, which has been handed down to us, is the \u592a \u5e73 \u5bf6 \u8a18 T'ai p'ing Huan y\u00fc ki, in 193 books, by \u694a \u53f2 Lo Shi, published during the period T'ai p'ing, A.D. 976\u2014983. The natural productions are given for each prefecture.\n\nThe \u5143 \u4e00 \u8f2f \u5fd7 Y\u00fcan I t'ung chi, or Great Geography of the Y\u00fcan or Mongol dynasty, seems to have survived only in some\n\n---\n\n23 These five books were translated by Stan. Julien. Sur la Culture des Muriers et l'Education des Vers \u00e0 soie, 1837.\n\n24 The articles on the cultivation of Boehmeria nivea and Pueraria Thunbergiana were translated by Stan. Julien. See: Industries de l'Empire Chinois I. c. 163, and Comptes rendus de l'Acad\u00e9mie des sciences XVII, 1843, p. 421.\n\n25 In 1842 Prof. W. Schott, Berlin, published in the \"Abhandlungen der Kgl. Akademie der Wissenschaften,\" p. 245\u2014285, a paper: Skizze zu einer Topographie der Produces des Chinesischen Reiches. After some bibliographical notices of the Pen tsao kang mu and other native works on Natural History, the author enumerates the Natural Products of China according to their geographical distribution. His information was drawn from the T'ai ping Huang y\u00fc ki and another descriptive account of China, the Kuang y\u00fc ki, which we have mentioned on a previous page.\nquotations drawn from it, and preserved in the writings of authors of the Ming; but the General Description of China referring to this latter dynasty is still extant and is not a rare book. It was published by \u674e\u8ce2 Li Hien, with the assistance of others, in 90 books, with numerous maps, in 1461, under the title \u5927\u660e\u4e00\u7d71\u5fd7 Ta Ming I t'ung chi.\n\nThe Great Geography of the Empire of the present dynasty, the \u5927\u6e05\u4e00\u7d71\u5fd7 Ta Ts'ing I t'ung chi, was compiled by Imperial command, and the first edition of it was published about the middle of last century. In this well known work, in 500 books, the matter is arranged on the same plan as that adopted for previous works of this class. The different provinces are taken up seriatim, and the descriptive accounts, given systematically for each prefecture, conclude with an enumeration of the natural productions.\n\nBesides this there exist many detailed descriptions of single provinces of China, and special works treat even of the greater part of the prefectures and districts. One or more books in these topographies are always devoted to an account of the natural productions, \u571f\u7522 tu ch'ian or \u755c\u7522 wu ch'ian. In some cases these are specified in great detail, accompanied by interesting remarks derived from local observers. I subjoin in the sequel a list of those native topographical works, or \u5730\u5fd7 chi, of the present dynasty, which I have had an opportunity of consulting, and which are frequently quoted in native botanical treatises. They have been published, for the most part, by Imperial authority, and the majority of them are based upon previous compilations, bearing sometimes the same titles. Some of these original accounts of the topography of the provinces, prefectures, or districts of the Empire can be traced back to a period as early as the 11th or 12th century.

It is a descriptive account of remarkable objects in the province of Kuang tung, in 16 books, containing interesting notes on Southern Chinese plants.\n\nThis record is found reproduced in the \u95a9\u6d77 Han hai collection of reprints, 1783.\n\n4. Early Acquaintance of the Chinese with Indian and Western Asiatic Plants.\n\nAfter Buddhism was introduced into China, A.D. 68, a frequent intercourse between this country and India commenced and did not cease for many centuries. Chinese Buddhist priests visited the land of Buddha, and Hindoo priests were invited by the Chinese Emperors to translate the Sacred writings from Sanscrit. Sanscrit names of Indian natural objects are frequently met in Buddhist works. These names appear in the Chinese translations rendered by Chinese characters, imitating the foreign sounds. Early attempts have also been made by the Chinese to explain the Sanscrit names of plants, animals, minerals and other objects, and to identify them with the corresponding Chinese terms. Although\nit does not seem that the Indian or Persian systems of medicine have ever influenced Chinese views on the art of healing or modified the sacred rules established in this respect by their primeval Emperors, it can nevertheless be concluded from some early Chinese works on Indian or Western medicines, the titles of which have been preserved, that the Chinese took an interest in the subject. In the History of the Sui dynasty (589\u2014618), book 34, Section on Literature, the following titles of collections of foreign medical prescriptions are mentioned:\n\nThe \u5a46\u7f85\u9580\u85e5\u65b9 Po lo men Yao fang, in 5 books. Medical Prescriptions of the Brahmans (Hindoos).\n\nThe \u5a46\u7f85\u9580\u8af8\u4ed9\u85e5\u65b9 Po lo men Chu sien yao fang, in 20 books. Medical Prescriptions of the Immortals of the Hindoos.\n\nThe \u4e7e\u9640\u5229\u6cbb\u9b3c\u65b9 Kan t'o li Chi hui fang, in 10 books. Medical Prescriptions for curing those possessed by demons; used in Kan t'o li.**\n\nThe \u897f\u57df\u540d\u91ab\u6240\u96c6\u8981\u65b9 Si yu Ming i su tsi yao fang, in 4 books. Medical Prescriptions of celebrated physicians in the Countries of the West.\n\nThe \u897f\u57df\u8af8\u4ed9\u6240\u8aaa\u85e5\u65b9 Si yu Chu sien su shuo yao fang, in 23 books.\n\nThe \u51fa\u80e1\u570b\u65b9 Ch'u Hu huo fang. Prescriptions from the Hu kingdoms, in 10 books, by \u6469\u8a36 Mo ho, who was a \u80e1\u6c99\u9580 Hu sha men, or priest of the Hu.*\n\nThe Pen ts'ao kang mu notices a \u80e1\u672c\u8349 Hu Pen ts'ao, or Materia medica of the Hu. See above History of Materia medica No. 14.\n\nStan. Julien (M\u00e9l. de G\u00e9ographie asiat. p. 144) mentions a Chinese work \u9593\u5916\u570b\u8a9e Fan wai kuo yu, of the 6th century, which he believes to be a translation of the well-known Sanscrit vocabulary Amara Cosha (first century B.C.).\n\nDuring the T'ang dynasty (618\u2014907) the Chinese took a great interest in the kingdoms of India, which they then reached by land as well as by sea. They became acquainted with many vegetable productions of those countries as well as of\n\n* According to the History of the Liang dynasty (502\u2014557) Kan t'o li was an island in the Southern Sea, somewhere near Annam it seems.\n\n** By Hu the Chinese generally understand Western Asia, sometimes also India.\nthe Indian Archipelago, much valued in China up to the present day. Thus in the Chinese works of that period on Geography and Natural History we often meet with Indian names of plants. Under the Sung dynasty (10\u201412th century) regular Sanscrit schools with Hindoo priests teaching the language were established in China. A Glossary of Sanscrit proper names occurring in the sacred writings, published during that period, has come down to us. It bears the title \u7ffb\u8b6f\u540d\u7fa9 Fan i ming i and was written by a priest named \u6cd5\u96f2 Fa y\u00fcn, in 1143, in 20 books, one of which is devoted to minerals, animals and plants. 75 Sanscrit names of plants are given there, rendered by Chinese sounds, and explained and identified, as far as possible, with the respective Chinese equivalents. About one-half of these names of plants may be found in Dr. Eitel's Handbook of Buddhism (1871), with the scientific botanical names added.\n\nThe term \u68b5\u66f8 fan shu (fan books), frequently met in the Pen ts'ao kang mu, in connection with Sanscrit names of natural objects, apparently denotes Sanscrit writings in general. Fan or properly \u68b5\u6469 fan mo means Brahma.\n\nFrom the 6th century the Chinese maintained frequent intercourse not only with India, but also with Persia, and during\n\n---\n\nIt may not be out of place to say here a few words on the attempts made by European Sanscrit scholars and botanists to ascertain the botanical names of plants noticed in the ancient Sanscrit Vocabulary, Amara Cosha, and other writings in the classical language of the Hindoos, which was a dead language, not spoken even at the time of Buddha. The results of these investigations have been brought together in J. F. Watson's Index to the native and scientific Names of Indians and other Eastern Plants, 1868, and also in R. Balfour's Cyclopaedia of India, the second edition of which appeared 1871\u20141878. The latter is a comprehensive work in five bulky volumes, generally compiled from good sources, but without much critical judgment and without thorough acquaintance with the immense and varied matter embraced in the Cyclopaedia of India. Thus the author does not hesitate to admit the existence of Sanscrit names for such plants as Agave americana, Anacardium occidentale, Anona squamosa and reticulata, Helianthus annuus, Mirabilis Jalapa, Nicotiana Tabacum, Zea Mays and other plants, which, as is well known, have been introduced into Asia from America, since the discovery of the New World. This fact induces me to doubt whether the identifications of ancient Sanscrit names of plants, as given in the above-mentioned works and Sanscrit dictionaries, are at all reliable. With respect to the author of the above-mentioned Amara Cosha, Mr. Balfour states that he was one of the nine poets at the court of Vijramaditya, and that he is supposed to have lived about A.D. 948. But under Vijramaditya we read that he reigned B.C. 56. Such contradictory statements on the same subject under different heads are not uncommon in the Cyclopaedia.\nthe T'ang dynasty, in the 8th and 9th centuries, with the Empire of the Kalifs, it seems by sea as well as by the overland route. In Chinese works of that period we find not infrequent accounts of remarkable natural productions of Western Asia. I may only notice here the \u897f\u967d\u96dc\u8a18 Yu yang tsa tsu, in 20 books, written by \u8cc8\u6210\u6b66 Tuan Ch'eng shi, towards the end of the 8th century (Wylie l.c. 155). According to Mayers (Chin. Read. Man. p. 211) the author died in 863. The Yu yang tsa tsu contains much information regarding the productions of China and of foreign countries, especially India and Persia.\n\nThere is a Chinese Vocabulary of Foreign Languages, published by the \u56db\u5937\u9928 Sz'i kuan, or Department of Interpreters, apparently in the 16th century, in which amongst other terms are given also the names of the most common plants in Chinese and in Persian Uigur, Siamese, Tibetan, Burmese and two other languages of some tribes at the Southern border of China. The words are all written in the original letters of the respective nations, and their pronunciation is indicated by Chinese characters. These vocabularies form an interesting contribution towards our knowledge of Asiatic names of plants. The Uigur names present a peculiar interest, as very little is known of this language. I may here mention that Mr. Scully has lately published two Turki Vocabularies of Birds and Plants in Mr. R. B. Shaw's Vocabulary of the Language of Eastern Turkistan.\n\nLet me notice finally the \u897f\u57df\u5716\u5fd7 Si yu t'u chi, a Description of Eastern Turkistan and the Chinese dependencies in the West, illustrated by a series of maps. It was published in 1756, in 52 books. In book 43 some details with respect to the natural productions of these regions are given. We find there the native (Turki) names (rendered by Chinese sounds) of more than fifty common plants, with the Chinese equivalents.\n\n---\n\n89 See Klaproth's Verzeichniss der Chines. und Mandah. B\u00fccher der Bibliothek in Berlin, 1822.\n5. HISTORY OF MATERIA MEDICA AND BOTANY IN JAPAN.\n\nThe greater part of the information contained in this record has been derived from a very able unpublished paper, drawn up at my request from reliable native sources by Dr. Geerts, a well-known scholar residing in that country, who with rare liberality has placed at my disposal the results of his researches into the history of Medicine and Botany in Japan.\n\nThe early civilisation of Japan, as well as that of Corea and Annam, was based almost entirely upon Chinese principles of culture, freely adopted by the barbarian neighbours of the mighty Chinese Empire. Annamese speech is obviously only a dialect of Chinese. It is known that the Japanese have two modes of writing, the alphabet of 48 characters, iroha, used in the simple style of writing, and the ideographical Chinese characters employed in public documents and scientific writings. The iroha, now considered to be the modification of certain familiar Chinese characters, is said to have been introduced into Japan from Corea in the second and first centuries B.C. Previous to that time the Japanese possessed no written language of their own.\n\nThe introduction of the Chinese written language into Japan is recorded in Japanese annals to have taken place in the 3rd century of our era. During the reign of the Japanese Empress Jing\u014d tenno, who invaded Corea at the end of the 2nd century, Chinese books were first brought thence to Japan. About A.D. 285 Atogi (\u963f\u5c60\u5c90), a son of the King of Corea, came on an embassy to the court of Japan, where he remained one year. He brought also some Chinese books, and at his instigation Wani (\u738b\u4ec1), a distinguished Chinese scholar, was invited from Corea to Japan to teach Chinese. He arrived in 286 and was appointed Instructor of the Imperial Princes. To him the introduction of Chinese characters into Japan is attributed. He is said to have been a native of the Chinese Kingdom of Go (\u5433 \u5433), the Eastern of the three states into which China was divided after the Han dynasty, and a descendant of the Emperors of that house. He lived in Fukusai (\u767e\u6fdf Po tsi), in South-eastern Corea.\u2014From this time the Chinese Classics and Literature of all branches\ngradually became the study of all higher classes in Japan, the nobles, military officers, priests and physicians. Thus from China was derived the knowledge of Agriculture, Manufactures, the Arts, Religion, Philosophy, Ethics, Medicine, etc.\n\nAs to the art of healing some native system of curing diseases existed no doubt in Japan in ancient times. Oanamuchi-no-Mikota and Sukuna Hikona no Mikota, two famous Japanese physicians, are both worshipped as medical divinities and as founders of the art of healing. But at an early period the Chinese principles of medicine were entirely adopted in Japan and have maintained themselves in that country up to the present time.\n\nJapanese annals record that A.D. 490 a Chinese physician, by name Kin po chen han ki wu, was invited by the Japanese Emperor from Corea to Japan. He came from the Corean kingdom Shin lo (\u65b0\u7f85 Sin lo).\n\nIn 554 Tei yu da (\u4e01\u6709\u9640) and Han ryo (\u6f58\u7464), two apothecaries, natives of the Corean kingdom of Kudara, arrived in Japan to teach Chinese medicine there. Six other Coreans are recorded to have been invited for the same purposes. The Chinese works on Materia medica known then in Japan were the \u795e\u8fb2\u672c\u8349\u7d93 and the \u540d\u91ab\u5225\u9304 (see above Hist. Mat. med. No. 1 and 7).\n\nIn 686 court physicians were for the first time appointed in Japan, and in 702 a great University for the promotion of Medicine, Astrology and other Chinese sciences was established at Dai sai, the seat of the Central government at that time. This place was situated in the Northern part of the island of Kiu shiu.\n\nAbout the year 850 this University at Dai sai was improved. The different branches of medical science were taught separately, viz.: Internal diseases, External diseases, Surgical operations, Infantile complaints, Diseases of the eyes, the ears, the mouth, teeth, etc., Acupuncture.\n\nFrom the year 717 a Botanical Garden was connected with the University, in which medicinal plants were cultivated. From the year 787 Materia medica was taught according to the Chinese treatises \u65b0\u4fee\u672c\u8349 (new revised Pen ts'ao) and the \u5510\u672c\u8349 (see above Hist. Mat. med. No. 11).\nIn 794 Kyoto became the capital of Japan, and the Emperor Kanmu tenno established there a University for the promotion of Chinese sciences. At about the same time libraries were first founded in Japan.\n\nIn 808 Hirosada, a Japanese physician, a native of the province of Idzumo, published in Japanese a Chinese work on Materia medica, entitled \u5927\u540c\u985e\u85e5\u65b9.* It was republished in 1827.\n\nFrom the second half of the 11th century a considerable trade in drugs was carried on between Japan and China.\n\nIn the second half of the 16th century the leading works on Materia medica studied in Japan were the Chinese treatises \u8ad6\u5bb6\u672c\u8349 and the \u958b\u5bf6\u672c\u8349 (see above Hist. Mat. med. No. 21, 22).\n\nHistory has preserved the names of three Japanese physicians of the 15th and 16th centuries famed for their knowledge of drugs, viz.: Takeda Sadamori (1467), Osada Tokuhon (1500), and Yoshida Soke (1550).\n\nThe Chinese \u672c\u8349\u7db1\u76ee Pen ts'ao hang mu, published as we have seen at the close of the 16th century, was known in Japan soon after its appearance. It was translated into Japanese with the Japanese title Hon zo ho mo ku, in 1714, by Ina Nobuyoshi (Ina Wakasui).\n\nThe \u6551\u8352\u672c\u8349 Xiu huang pen ts'ao (i.e. No. 35) was translated two years later.\n\nThe historical facts recorded in the above sketch of the development of botanical knowledge in Japan leave no doubt that the Materia medica of the Japanese was originally entirely based upon Chinese works, which have been reprinted and commented upon in Japan, especially since the 9th century. It is further known that from the 7th and 8th centuries learned Chinese and Corean physicians and Buddhist priests frequently came to Japan; whilst on the other hand Japanese physicians used to visit China with the purpose of studying medicinal plants. They thus had an opportunity of comparing Chinese and Japanese plants, and were enabled to identify the species found in both countries. Thus we find in Japanese works on Botany, besides the popular\n\n* Chinese catalogues do not mention this treatise.\nJapanese appellations of plants, in many instances also Chinese names written in Chinese characters. It seems that most of these identifications can be traced back to the period of the Chinese T'ang dynasty, for the character T'ang (Kara in Japanese), frequently found in Japanese names of plants, is always used there to designate the Chinese origin of a plant. But some Chinese names applied now-a-days to Japanese plants occur for the first time in the Kiu huang pen ts'o, and this proves that Japanese botanists subsequent to the time of publication of this work (beginning of the 16th century) continued to determine the plants of their country from Chinese botanical works. It can be said that these identifications of Chinese and Japanese plants made by Japanese botanists at different times are correct upon the whole, at least as far as the genus is concerned. Sometimes the same Chinese name is applied in China and in Japan to different species of the same genus, seldom to plants having no resemblance to each other. The tree ch'\u00fc in Chinese books is *Ailantus glandulosa*; but in Japan where the tree is not found the above Chinese character is applied to *Euscaphis staphyleoides*. Sieb. et Zucc. fl. Japon. I, 124. We learn from Siebold that the inner bark of the root of this Japanese shrub is largely used in the country as an efficacious remedy in dysentery, just as the inner bark of the root of Ailantus is used by the Chinese.\u2014Ma sien hao in China is *Incarvillea sinensis*, not observed in Japan, where the above Chinese name designates *Pedicularis resupinata*.\n\nThe Chinese names of plants given in Japanese botanical works together with the popular Japanese names act there the part of our scientific botanical names.\n\nIt was in 1700 that the first original Japanese work on Materia medica was published by Kaibara Rakuten, with the title Yamato Honzo, in 18 books.\n\nA small treatise on Japanese Botany was published about the middle of the last century, with the title Kwa wi, by the Japanese botanist Yo nan shi, assisted by his pupil Ono Ranzan. The Kwa wi comprises eight books, in which 200 plants are described. The drawings accompanying the text are not of a high\norder. This treatise was translated into French by Dr. L. Savatier in 1873.\n\nOno Ranzan, the collaborator of Yo nan shi, subsequently became a celebrated botanist,\u2014not only from a Japanese point of view. In his writings we first observe the influence of European science upon Japanese views on botany. The Dutch, after the expulsion of Europeans in 1639, were during more than two centuries the only European nation allowed to carry on trade with Japan; but they were not allowed to see more of Japan than the little island of Decima (Nagasaki). Notwithstanding this restriction they succeeded in awakening among the Japanese an interest in European science, especially natural history; and since the middle of the last century we find in Japan many native botanists who have studied botany from European books.\n\nOno Ranzan, whom Siebold styles the Linnaeus of Japan, wrote an important commentary on the Pen ts'ao kang mu, with the title \u672c\u8349\u7db1\u76ee\u5553\u8499 Hon zo ko moku kei mo, in 35 books, in which he displays a considerable critical judgment. He proves also that the majority of the natural productions of China are likewise found in Japan. This work was published in 1804, after the death of the author, by his grandson, who in 1847 issued another revised and enlarged edition.\n\nFurther particulars with respect to Japanese botanists and their scientific productions may be found in the introductory part of Dr. A. I. C. Geerts\u2019 \u201cProduits de la nature japonaise et chinoise,\u201d 1878. I shall confine myself to saying a few words on some more recent Japanese botanical works, which I myself possess and from which I have derived great assistance in determining plants described and depicted in Chinese botanical works.\n\nThe \u672c\u8349\u5716\u8b5c Hon zo zu fu, published in 1828, in 96 books, by Iwasaki Tsunemasa of Yeddo, describes 1795 plants and gives as many coloured drawings. It is now very difficult to obtain a complete printed copy of the work, the greater part of the edition having probably been destroyed by fire. I possess only the first ten books of it, but have had an opportunity of consulting a complete copy in the Library of the Imperial Academy at St. Petersburg. The arrangement followed in it is that of the Pen ts'ao kang mu.\nAnother Japanese general work on Botany of much higher claim than the above-mentioned, was published in 1866, with the title \u8349\u6728\u56f3\u8aac So moku dzu setsu, by Inuma Chojun, a pupil of Dr. Siebold. But only 20 books of this Japanese Flora japonica have been issued. They comprise the first section, Herbaceous plants (with the exception of Grasses), wild and cultivated, arranged according to the system of Linn\u00e6us, and accompanied with 1215 admirably executed drawings, made from nature and answering perfectly all scientific purposes. It has full claim to the accuracy of a scientific work. Besides the Japanese name for each plant, the Chinese names are also given, if such exist, and in many cases we find also the Linnean or popular Dutch names added. This work is frequently quoted in Maximowicz's numerous publications on the Flora of Japan. He quotes it (after Miquel) with the incorrect title Soo bof. I have heard that in 1875 a new enlarged edition of the So moku dzu setsu has been published by Tanaka. Dr. Savatier has attempted, with the assistance of Franchet, to determine the plants not only of the So moku dzu setsu, but also as far as possible those represented on the plates of the Hon zo dzu fu. See their \"Enumeratio Plantarum in Japonia sponte crescentium,\" 1876.\n\nI possess also a short but very valuable Japanese treatise on Poisonous plants, the \u6709\u6bd2\u8349\u6728\u56f3\u8aac Yu doku so moku dzu setsu, illustrated by fine wood-cuts, in two books, with 123 plates. This was published in 1827 by the Japanese Horticultural Society of the province of Owari.\n\n6. ON THE BOTANICAL KNOWLEDGE OF COREANS, MANCHOOS, MONGOLS, AND TIBETANS.\n\nTributary to China for ages, Corea at an early period universally adopted the Chinese form of civilisation, and it was in Corea that the Japanese first became acquainted with the Chinese language, mode of writing, and literature. Although the Coreans, like the Japanese, possess their own alphabet, there is no national literature in their country, all literary works composed by Coreans\nhaving been written in Chinese. One of the best Chinese works on Medicine is of Corean origin. The \u6771\u91ab\u5bf6\u9451 Tung i pao kien, or Precious Mirror of Eastern Medicine, written during the Ming, at the end of the 16th or beginning of the 17th century, by \u8a31\u8b19 Hs\u00fc Pa, a native of \u9633\u5e73 Yang ping in South-western Corea, embraces the whole compass of medicine, as well as Materia medica. It comprises 28 large books and has been several times republished in China. Although it claims in some respects to be original, this originality refers more to the arrangement of the matter, and as can be concluded from the quotations, it was compiled from Chinese authors. It does not seem that Corean Medicine and Materia medica differ from Chinese works on the subject. As in the Corean language a large portion of Chinese words and phrases, even for common expressions, have been borrowed from the Chinese, we need not be surprised to find that many plants grown in Corea are known to the natives only by their Chinese names. Corean names for the most common plants in that country may be found in Dr. Siebold's \u7d20\u5408 Lei ho, or Vocabularium sinense in koraianum conversum, opus sinicum origine in peninsula Koral impressum, 1838; and also in Putsillo's Russian-Corean Dictionary (in Russian), 1874.\n\nLately a more complete Corean dictionary has been published with the title: Dictionnaire Cor\u00e9en-Fran\u00e7ais, par les Missionnaires de Cor\u00e9e. Yokohama, 1880.\n\nThere is also no original Manchoo system of Medicine or Materia medica extant. As is known, Manchoo literature dates only from the end of the 17th century and consists of translations from Chinese works, such as Dictionaries, the Classics, Histories of China, novels, etc. As far as I know the only Manchoo work on Medicine is a treatise on Anatomy, translated from a European work by the Jesuit Father Parennin, in 1723. My colleague and friend, Dr. Dudgeon, possesses a manuscript copy of this translation, illustrated by beautifully executed drawings. (See his \"Report of the Peking Hospital for 1878 and 1879,\" p. 46.) A manuscript copy of the same, but without drawings, is likewise found in the Library of the Russian Legation at Peking.\nAn interesting list of Manchoo names of plants and drugs, with the equivalent Chinese names added, is found in the great Comparative Dictionary in Chinese and three other Eastern Asiatic languages, of which we shall speak further on. The Manchoo names referring to Chinese plants not found in Manchuria are frequently forged.\n\nThe system of medicine adopted by the Mongol physicians in Mongolia seems to be based on Tibetan principles of the art of healing. The majority of medicines used in Mongolia are compounded of Tibetan drugs. Very little on the subject has hitherto come under the notice of investigators into Eastern Asiatic medicine. There are several Tibetan treatises on the art of healing and Materia medica. Cosma de K\u00f6r\u00f6s has given the Analysis of a Tibetan medical work in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, IV, p. 1, but he does not say much regarding Tibetan medicines. I had once an opportunity of seeing in Peking a kind of Tibetan Natural history, with rude drawings, in which the Tibetan names of natural objects were accompanied with the corresponding Chinese names. The book was styled \u672c\u8349 Pen t'ao in Chinese.\n\nDr. J. Rehmann, a Russian physician, procured in 1805 in Maimaicheng (on the frontier of Mongolia, opposite Kiakhta) 60 Tibetan (or Chinese) drugs used by the Mongol physicians. He examined these specimens with the assistance of the botanist Redowsky and described them (in German) in a small pamphlet entitled: Beschreibung einer Tibetischen Hand-Apotheke. St. Petersburg, 1811. Rehmann gives also the Tibetan names of each drug in Tibetan letters and the pronunciation in German.\n\n---\n\n41 There is in the city of Urga, in Northern Mongolia, an old Tibetan Lama priest, Cho is des famed for his skill in curing diseases. His reputation has even spread over Siberia, and Russians from Kiakhta or Irkutsk are not unfrequently seen in Urga submitting to the medical treatment of the old Mongolian Aesculapius, whose medicines are all derived from Tibet. It seems to me that in the majority of cases his success must be attributed to the healthy mountain air of Urga.\n\n42 Dr. Rehmann accompanied in 1805 the Russian Embassy under Count Golovkin to China. To the same Embassy were attached Redowsky, Adams, and Helm, as naturalists; the celebrated Klapproth as orientalist. As is known Golovkin was obliged to return from Urga to Russia.\nAs to the drugs derived from the vegetable kingdom, he was of course only in a few cases able to determine the botanical origin of these medicines.\n\nA more complete collection of drugs used in Mongol or Tibetan medicine can be found in Peking in the shop of \u842c\u5fb7\u865f Wan I hao, a rich Chinese firm, well known among the Mongols, Tanguts and Tibetans, as it carries on a great commercial intercourse with these nations and supplies the wants of the merchants and Lama priests who are accustomed to repair to Peking in winter. This shop is situated between the British and Russian Legations, near the so called Mongol market. The proprietor has published a list of 365 drugs obtainable at his store, giving the names in Tibetan and Chinese and adding the pronunciation of the Chinese characters in Tibetan letters. The list is preceded by a short preface and followed by a postscript, both in Mongol and Tibetan. The preface invites ecclesiastics\u2014lama as well as laymen\u2014especially those living in Mongolia and desirous of alleviating the suffering of their fellowmen, to apply to the aforesaid shop for the drugs enumerated in the list in two languages, Tibetan and Chinese. For selecting and arranging this assortment several medical treatises of celebrated physicians are stated to have been consulted. In the postscript it is stated that the drugs offered for sale in the shop of Wan I hao under the above Tibetan names, are not always exactly the same as the original productions of Tibet bearing these names in that country; but their medical virtues are stated to be similar. Purchasers are requested not to suppose that these drugs have been collected without judgment. Besides this the seller directs the attention of the public to the advantage of procuring drugs from a great firm instead of buying them in retail shops. The postscript is signed by Gonbedjan, Professor of the Tibetan school at Peking.\n\nAmong the drugs enumerated in this catalogue there are 74 minerals, 22 articles derived from the animal kingdom; the remaining 269 belong to the vegetable kingdom. The greater portion of them can be determined.\n\nThe most important guide for identifying Mongol, Tibetan and Manchoo names of natural productions, and especially economic\nplants and drugs, is without doubt the great Dictionary in four languages, the \u56db\u9ad4\u6e05\u6587\u9451 Sz\u2019 t\u2019i ts\u2019ing wen kien, published by Imperial command during the reign of Kang hi. A revised edition of it was issued by order of the Emperor K\u2019ien lung about the middle of last century. The books 27\u201429 deal with plants, and about 600 names of cultivated and wild species are enumerated there in Chinese, Manchoo, Mongol, and Tibetan. The pronunciation of Manchoo and Mongol names is indicated by Chinese characters. As most of the plants mentioned in this dictionary are known to me from the Chinese names given, I have thus been enabled to ascertain the Manchoo, Mongol, and Tibetan names of a considerable number of common plants of Eastern Asia. Very little has hitherto been done in the way of identifying names of plants in these languages. In Balfour\u2019s Cyclopaedia of India and Watson\u2019s Index of native and scientific names of Eastern Plants we find occasionally some Tibetan (Ladak) names of plants; Maximowicz in his Prim. Flore amurensis gives 5 or 6 Manchurian names. In Zigra\u2019s Dendrology of Russia we meet with some Mongol, Tartar, and Kalmuk names. Some names of common plants in the languages of the Kalmuks and the Kirghizes will be found in Professor Galstunsky\u2019s Russian-Kalmuk Dictionary, 1860, and in Ilminsky\u2019s Kirghiz Dictionary, 1861.\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nON THE SCIENTIFIC DETERMINATION OF THE PLANTS MENTIONED IN CHINESE WORKS.\n\nWe now come to the most important, but at the same time most difficult part of our researches. In order that Western science may profit by a study of Chinese botanical works it is necessary not only to understand the Chinese written characters but also to recognize the plants described and to ascertain their scientific names. Our knowledge of the Botany of China is still very defective, more so indeed, it may be safely said, than that\nof the Flora of the interior of Africa and Australia. Those regions of the Empire especially to which the majority of plants described in Chinese books refer, have never been trodden by the foot of a botanical collector. Thus the greater part of the vegetable productions detailed in Chinese works on Materia medica and Botany are unknown to Europeans. If the plants in question are not of common occurrence in the provinces visited by them, it is generally impossible to make anything of the vague descriptions given by Chinese botanists. Occasionally the drawings found in the previously mentioned native botanical works enable us to determine at least the genus or the order to which the plants belong. On the other hand, there may be in European collections plants from China, noticed also in Chinese works, but the native names have not been added to the scientific ones.\n\nThe only exact method of ascertaining the botanical names corresponding to Chinese denominations of plants is to obtain the plants in nature and to determine them. I may however observe that, although the common cultivated plants are known under the same Chinese names all over the Empire, many other plants, especially drugs, go under different local names in different provinces. Li Shi chen, the author of the Pen ts'ao kang mu, and other authors before him, have attempted to bring these synonyms together, but perhaps they have not always been correct in their identifications. In some instances also the same Chinese names are applied to distinct plants in different parts of China. It is therefore desirable that naturalists, who collect native names of plants, should always state in what part of China these names are used.\n\nThe first difficulty we encounter in identifying Chinese names of plants with the scientific appellations, is to secure trustworthy and competent natives to procure authentic specimens of the plants desired. The majority of drugs dealt with in Chinese treatises on Materia medica are yielded by wild growing mountain plants. The mountains of Chihli, Shantung, Shansi, Honan,\nand Ss' ch'uan are especially famed for the medicinal herbs they produce. These drugs (roots, leaves, flowers, fruits, etc.) for the most part reach the apothecary's shop cut in little pieces or pulverized. The apothecary knows nothing about the plants from which they are derived, nor concerning the place whence they have been gathered. Our specialists in Europe are also seldom able to determine these fragments. It is the same with many other Chinese articles of commerce furnished by plants. It is for instance generally impossible to get any reliable information regarding the trees yielding the numerous precious woods used all over China for making furniture. It is therefore necessary to apply directly to those who collect these drugs, or who sell the trees; and this is not an easy task.\n\nThe \u1f30\u03c7\u03b8\u03c5\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9, as the gatherers of medicinal plants were termed in ancient Greece, are chiefly represented in China by Buddhist priests. They live in the temples which abound in the mountains here, and are usually well acquainted with medicinal and other plants, and with their properties and applications for domestic purposes.\n\nIt is more easy to procure authentic specimens of the cultivated vegetation of China and to ascertain the Chinese names. Great caution must however be observed in accepting these names from the statements of the natives, and in order to arrive at a reliable determination, various competent sources of information on the same subject should always be consulted. European collectors of plants in China should never omit to inquire after the Chinese names of the plants they gather, and should try to have them written on their labels in Chinese characters. This is more easy to realise in China, where every beggar knows how to write, than European readers might imagine. Chinese names of plants, rendered only by European spelling, have little value, as errors will frequently creep in, and they are generally unintelligible even for sinologues.\n\nHaving obtained specimens of plants and ascertained their native names, the next step essential to the success of our investigations will be to have them determined by a competent botanist.\n\nknown market for drugs. The drugs of the province of Chihli are exported from Tien tsin. See Customs Report 1865, p. 28.\nAlthough Europe abounds in botanists, the number of those from whom a reliable determination of Chinese plants may be expected is very limited. For not only a thorough knowledge of the Flora of Eastern Asia is required for this purpose, but the botanist who sets himself to examine plants, and especially exotic plants, must be in a position which will enable him to refer (for the purpose of identification and comparison of species) to some complete general herbaria in Europe. Now-a-days all botanists agree in the view that it is impossible to recognize and identify plants from descriptions only. To decide whether a particular plant is identical with another already described, it is necessary to compare it with an authentic specimen of the latter, and the author who proposes a new specific name, is bound to prove by direct examination of specimens of all the other species of the same genus or allied forms that the plant in question has really not been previously described.\n\nProf. A. Bunge, in his Enum. plant. Chine\u00e6 bor. (1831) No. 238, took a kind of yellow Jasmin, which he first observed in Peking, to be identical with Jasminum angulare Vahl, a plant of the Cape of Good Hope (white flowers). He evidently relied only on an imperfect description of this plant. The Peking plant was subsequently proved by Lindley to be quite a distinct species, which then was named Jasminum nudiflorum.\u2014Owing to the same want of other collections for comparison, Prof. Bunge described Prunus trichocarpa as a new species from Peking. But this plant had long before been described by Thunberg as Pr. tomentosa (from Japan).\u2014The same author describes l. c. No. 81 the wild growing Jujube of Peking as a spinose variety of Zizyphus vulgaris Lam. One of our first botanical authorities in Europe, to whom I had sent specimens of this thorny shrub, very common in North-China, suggested to me that it was Z. Lotus; and the specimens of this shrub of Northern Africa kindly sent to me by him prove that there is indeed no difference between Z. Lotus and Bunge\u2019s Z. vulgaris, var. spinosa.\u2014There are in the mountains West of Peking two species of Syringa, distinguishable at first sight by the size of their leaves. For a long time the botanists of the Botanical Gardens at St. Petersburg considered the large-leaved species to be S. villosa Vahl, first observed near Peking in the middle of the last century by\nd'Incarville, whilst the small-leaved one figures in the herbaria of St. Petersburg as *S. pubescens* Turcz. But from Prof. Decaisne's elaborate memoir on Ligustrum and Syringa I learn that *S. villosa* and *S. pubescens* are the same plant (the small-leaved), and that the other species (*S. villosa* of Russian botanists) is *S. Emodi* Wall., first observed in the Himalayas. Prof. Decaisne had of course seen authentic specimens of all these plants.\n\nThe works on systematic botany by Willdenow, Sprengel, Roemer and Schultes and others, published previous to De Candolle's Prodromus, have little value so far as they attempt to decide botanical questions relating to China. At least the identification and changing of names of Loureiro's plants, as laid down by these authors, were certainly not based upon an inspection of Loureiro's herbarium.\n\nSufficient material for determining Chinese plants can only be found in the vast store houses of botanical collections in London, Paris, and St. Petersburg, which are especially rich in Eastern Asiatic plants. We also ought not to omit mentioning in this place the extensive herbarium of Dr. Hance in Whampoa, which as regards Chinese specimens may perhaps represent the most complete collection extant. Dr. Hance possesses also a great number of Indian, Japanese, and Siberian plants, and thus is well qualified to pronounce a competent judgment on questions referring to Chinese plants.\n\nI need not say that the determination of plants requires great experience and attention. Even the most accomplished botanists are liable to err in their diagnoses. We must not forget that in the majority of cases (especially when they have to examine collections from distant countries) they rely entirely on dried materials, and these too, often imperfect specimens which must be deciphered like hieroglyphics of a dead language. Living plants show many characteristics, and very often striking ones, which cannot be recognized in dried specimens, or at any rate are liable to alteration, as, for instance, the colour of the flowers and other organs, their odour, etc. Probably many botanists who know a foreign plant only from herbaria, would often fail to recognize the same at first sight, when met in a living state.\nIn order to set down a complete and correct description of a plant it is desirable, but seldom practicable, to examine a considerable number of freshly gathered specimens. For this reason botanists in Europe always try to procure seeds of exotic plants for cultivation at home. But it is generally very difficult to get ripe seeds of rare wild growing plants, and the seeds are often spoiled before reaching their destination. Sometimes plants cultivated out of their native country show considerable aberrations from the ordinary wild type. Thus Planchon (D. C. Prod. XVII, p. 173) refuses to identify the *Celtis sinensis* Pers., introduced from China in the last century and cultivated since that time in South-Europe, with the *Celtis sinensis* collected by later authors in China. Compare also Prof. Decaisne's interesting investigations regarding the native country of the Sunflower and the Topinambour (Flore des Serres, XXIII.).\n\nAs in most cases botanists, who have to describe foreign plants, cannot refer to living specimens, a critical responsibility rests with the collector who observes the plants in their wild state, and who is often therefore in a position to decide easily dubious botanical questions by examining fresh specimens. In noting down the colours of the flowers and other organs, the odour, the general appearance and the stature of the plant, the conditions under which it grows, wild or cultivated, and in adding also in the memorandum, if possible, the native name, the collector will essentially complete the descriptive details of the botanist. But in the generality of cases the collectors of plants pay little attention to these particulars; and then it is their fault and not that of the describer that the descriptions of foreign plants in systematic works are generally so unsatisfactory, and that often those characteristics, by which an observer of the living plant is struck\n\n---\n\n44 It is a good practice with some botanists who describe new plants, to preserve in the new generic or specific names the indigenous popular appellations, where known. Among Chinese names of plants introduced into our scientific botanical nomenclature, I may quote: *Magnolia Yulan*, *Poaonia Montana*, *Diospyros Shitze*, *Nandina domestica*, *Nephelium Litchi* and *N. Longiss* (Lung yen). This rule should be more generally adopted. But unfortunately the fashion now-a-days cherished among botanists is to transform names of savants or other persons (who frequently have had nothing to do with the plant dedicated to them) into botanical names, which are often dissimilar and difficult to pronounce.\nat the first glance, are omitted. Let me illustrate these remarks by a few examples.\n\n*Stackys affinis* Bge., known for a long time from North-China and Japan, is at once distinguished from other species by its fleshy root resembling somewhat a turreted shell. Maximowicz, to whom I sent complete specimens some years ago, was the first author to mention the characteristic roots of the plant. See his \"Ad Florae Asi\u00e6 orient. cogn. fragm.\" 1879, p. 46.\n\n*Pinus Bungeana*, the beautiful white-barked Pine of Peking, was first described in 1847 by Zu\u00e7carini, and has been cultivated in Europe since 1862. The most remarkable feature of this tree is its white bark, as if lime-washed. But this characteristic (not found on young trees) was for a long time unknown to European botanists and gardeners, and is still little known in Europe. Koch in his Dendrology III, p. 311 (published 1875) describes *P. Bungeana*, but does not mention the white bark.\n\nEvery foreigner, who visits Peking for the first time, is struck by the appearance of a certain large orange-coloured fruit sold in the streets. It is especially remarkable for the peculiar shape it presents. This fruit, called *Shi tz'* by the natives, is flattened and shows a more or less deep circular furrow which divides it into two stories. This is the *Diospyros Schi tz'* first described by Bunge, fifty years ago. But Bunge says only in describing the fruit: *bacca maxima depressa*, but does not mention the furrow. Since Bunge several authors have described *D. Schi tz'* (Carri\u00e8re, Decaisne, Hiern, Naudin), but none of them record the peculiar shape of the fruit; and the drawing given under the above name in Naudin's lately published memoir on the genus *Diospyras* shows a rather small globular fruit, like an apple, without the characteristic furrow, and represents, I believe, specimens cultivated in France, from seeds received from Peking. It seems however that the passage in Naudin's description of the fruit: *bacca interdum ad mediam longitudinem quasi constrict\u00e6 coronata*, alludes to the before-mentioned peculiarity of the cultivated *Shi tz'* of North-China, which is always aspernous. But the fruit cultivated in France as *Shi tz'* and represented by Naudin, exists here, although it is not common in Peking. It is not the fruit\nwhich Bunge saw and which he describes as bacca maxima depressa, asperma, since it always contains seeds, whilst the other is propagated by grafting only.\n\nIt seems to me that Bentham's Flora hongkongensis can be adduced as an example of short, popular and characteristic descriptions of plants, and, although the precision and correctness in exhibiting the details is due to the experience of the eminent author, a considerable portion of the information about Hongkong plants has certainly been furnished by the collectors, and chiefly by Dr. Hance, who for many years has zealously studied the Flora of the island.\n\nOccasionally the most experienced botanists are liable to errors when working on dried imperfect material, whilst on the other hand persons even with a modest stock of botanical knowledge, but having the opportunity of observing plants in their native countries, are enabled to clear up dubious botanical questions and to correct incontestably statements of professional authors.\n\nIn Turczaninow's Enum. plant. Chine bor. (1837) and Maximowicz's Index Flore pekin. (1850) we find two Peking species of Catalpa noticed, viz.: C. syringaefolia Turcz., and C. Bungei C. A. Mey. In D. C. Prodr. IX, 226 the first is considered a variety of the latter, distinguished by the form of the leaves. But whoever has seen these trees in Peking, where they are common, will be easily convinced that they constitute one species only, and that even a variety cannot be admitted, the leaves on the same tree being always very variable in shape, heart-shaped, entire, lobed or laciniate, triangular, sinuate, etc.\n\nThe same may be said of Seramum indicum L., much cultivated in the Peking plain. In D. C. Prodr. IX, 250 three varieties of this cultivated plant are distinguished, according to the form of the leaves (grandidentatum, subdentatum, subdivisum). But this distinction is also untenable. Here at Peking at least we frequently see on the same plant entire, lobate, or trisected leaves. I have sent such specimens to St. Petersburg.\n\nThe Chinese in the Northern provinces cultivate a beautiful yellow Rose, very prickly, with small pinnated leaves. I have been told that it occurs in a wild state in the mountains of North-China and Southern Mongolia. Rose figures in Bunge's\nEnum. Chin. bor. as *Rosa pimpinellifolia* L., varietas floribus majusculis sulphureis. The specimens of the same plant in the Herbarium of the Botanical Gardens at St. Petersburg (some of them sent by myself) have been determined by Cr\u00e9pin as *R. pimpinellifolia*, var. *densiflora*, and in his Monography of Roses (Bull. Soc. Bot. Belg. 1874, 75) he mentions *R. pimpinellifolia* as found at Peking, without noticing however its yellow flowers (on dried specimens the flowers are white). Cr\u00e9pin, as well as all previous authors who speak of *R. pimpinellifolia*, attribute to this Rose, which has a large area of geographical distribution, rose-coloured or white flowers. Last year I forwarded some specimens of our yellow Peking Rose\u2014taken from the same shrub in my garden as those sent to St. Petersburg\u2014to an eminent French botanist, who informed me that it differs widely from *R. pimpinellifolia* of the environs of Paris, but seems to be closely allied to *Rosa xanthina* Lindl., and is perhaps the same.\n\nFive species of *Orobanche* have been noticed by different authors as occurring at Peking, viz.: two with white flowers: *O. macrolepis* Turcz., and *O. pycnostachya* Hce.\u2014three with blue flowers: *O. ammophila* C. A. Mey., *O. albolanata* Steud. (*O. canescens* Bge.); *O. ombrocharis* Hce.\u2014Mr. Maximowicz, who some years ago was kind enough to determine for me the species of Orobanche I had gathered in the Peking mountains, and who on that occasion examined all the species of this genus from Peking found in the herbaria of St. Petersburg\u2014suggested to me by letter that the characteristics on which these species are founded (lower lip of the corolla entire or bilobate; anthers barbate or glabrous) are fallacious and inconstant, and that from dried specimens alone it is impossible to decide whether the lower lip is bilobed or not. As these plants are succulent it is difficult to press them properly, and the flowers shrivel. Maximowicz, who seems disposed to think that the five described species of Orobanche are to be reduced to two species, requested me to examine the flowers of the living plants. I have not yet had an opportunity of doing so, as these plants grow in the mountains; and I was not able last year to visit the regions where they are found at the proper season. But from my former experience on the subject I have no doubt that Maximowicz is right in\nhis supposition, and my own impression has always been that the genus Orobanche in the Pekin Flora is represented by two species only: one scentless blue-flowered, and one fragrant with white flowers and yellow filaments and anthers.\n\nIn 1860 Dr. Hance described in the Ann. sc. nat. Advers. p. 18 (see also Journ. of Botany 1860, 295) *Sambucus Williamsii* as a new species gathered in the neighbourhood of Peking by Dr. Wells Williams. The inflorescence arranged in a lax compound corymbe is given as characteristic. I myself gathered a number of specimens of a Sambucus growing at the same place. Maximowicz declared it to be *S. racemosa* L., which is frequent in the Peking plain and in the mountains. See also Bge. Enum. Chin. bor. No. 193. The inflorescence of this species (generally described as an ovoid panicle) varies in shape at Peking. On younger plants (rarely seen in flower and distinguished by larger leaflets) the panicle does not develop so well as on old specimens (small trees). Although I have not seen Dr. Williams' original specimen, I have little doubt that it was taken from a young plant of *S. racemosa*. Dr. Hance has hardly examined a great number of specimens of his *S. Williamsii*.\n\nA great obstacle in the way of utilizing the results of modern botanical research is the tendency observable among the majority of botanists of our days to multiply unreasonably the genera and species. They thus create a mass of new names, the greater part of which, being rejected by more considerate authors, figure afterwards as useless synonyms in works of descriptive botany, and occasion a kind of scientific confusion of names which leads to erroneous inferences. Some botanists even go so far as to propose to change (without any botanical reason) names, consecrated by long use, in favour of new ones, which seem to them more appropriate. See e.g. St. Leger's R\u00e9forme de la Nomenclature Botanique. 1880.\n\nIt is in vain, that we ask what benefit can accrue to science from the extravagant subtilization and differentiation now prevailing in systematic botany, by which the study of that science is rendered so complicated. Nobody will, I think, now-a-days attempt to maintain the view that it lay in the plan of nature, in producing living beings, to create them according to a scheme\nresembling the so called natural systems by which our naturalists are guided. These ingenious systems answer their purposes only in a general way. In many instances we do not find in living nature precisely defined and exactly divided Orders, Genera, and Species; but we observe more frequently gradual transitions by more or less numerous intermediaries (which often have become extinct now) from one form to another. It is even not possible to separate precisely the vegetable from the animal kingdom. These facts render the application of our systems of classification to natural objects often difficult.\n\nWhen Linn\u00e6us first attempted to group plants in a rational way, according to certain characters they possessed in common, and when he first proposed the generic and specific appellations, one of his principal objects in view was apparently to establish a reasonable rule for nomenclature. His ingenious plan was unanimously adopted, but it is to be regretted that the principles now followed in laying down the limits of genera and species widely diverge from the good sense displayed in this regard by old Linn\u00e6us. A system of classification answering all purposes of precise distinction is a desideratum which will never be attained. Although it seems to be of primary importance to have a definite idea of what is to be understood by Genus, Species, and Variety, these terms have never been satisfactorily explained, and they have really not a very exact meaning. This question is entirely left to the judgment of the particular authors, and every botanist has his own opinion on the matter and follows generally a system of his own. Thus we find in systematic botany the greatest incongruities in the matter of distinctive characters required to justify the establishing of a new genus or species.\n\nFrom a practical point of view, and for the sake of clearness, it seems to me more reasonable that the range of genus and species should be less limited, i.e., to admit less genera and more species; and on the other hand, less species and more varieties. If such a rule were adopted, the botanical names would more clearly indicate the affinities of plants than the multitude of new generic and specific appellations, separated from the names of the original genus and species\u2014separations which are often founded on characteristics of little value. Take the genus Urgonia of Linn\u00e6us\nas an example. It has been divided by Klotzch into 41 new genera. Bentham and Hooker, in their Genera Plant. I, 842, reject these altogether, admitting only the genus Begonia.\n\nThe number of names of plants met now-a-days in botanical works is enormous; and it can hardly be supposed that there is a single botanist who would be able to retain in his memory even the generally admitted generic names, to say nothing of the synonyms.\n\nI know well that in entering a protest against the multiplication of generic and specific names in botany, I tread on delicate ground. I would never have dared, with my modest knowledge and experience in botanical matters, to profess an opinion so little coinciding with the ideas of the majority of botanists, had not my judgment been principally guided by the experiences laid down in Bentham and Hooker's Genera Plantarum. The eminent authors of this work reject about one-half of the hitherto proposed genera (or assign to them the rank of subgenera at the most). As regards the hitherto described species, they seem to reduce them in a much larger proportion and throw together large heaps of useless synonyms. Thus they reduce the species of *Roses* from 250 enumerated species to 30; those of *Rubus* from 500 to 100; of *Cinnamomum* from 50 to 10; of *Nasturtium* from 80 to 20; of *Gossypium* from 13 to 3\u20144, etc. Other competent botanists, having made experiments in cultivating the various species of *Capsicum*, described in systematic works, have come to the conclusion that all cultivated Capsica are nothing but varieties of *C. annuum* L.\n\nI would not like to be credited, however, with advocating a superficial examination of plants, and a generalization in the descriptive details; nor have I any fault to find with a minute differentiation and dividing in systematic botany, supposing these characters apply to subgenera and varieties, and are not intended to raise plants unreasonably to generic or specific rank. It cannot be denied that a careful distinction of the characters, and numerous divisions and subdivisions in systematic works essentially facilitate the determination of plants. But an extravagant nomenclature cannot but confuse the notions which systematic botany ought to exhibit with respect to the relative affinities of plants.\nI am inclined to believe that in the majority of instances the irrelevant naming of new species and genera arises from vanity in some writers, desirous of affixing their names to new scientific appellations. For this reason botanists are often in a great hurry to establish a new species, based perhaps upon the examination of a single specimen or other inadequate material, as even in case of this new name being subsequently rejected, it remains at least preserved among the synonyms. I do not think that I am exaggerating in asserting that more than one-half of the new specific names now-a-days proposed may be considered as useless synonymic ballast. Would it not be better in describing a supposed new plant to give its more prominent characters, placing it temporarily as a variety near the species to which it is most nearly allied, and to wait for further material? But there is less merit in discovering a variety than a new species!\n\nIt is really astonishing to read what characteristics are sometimes adduced as foundations for a new species. Carri\u00e8re (Revue Hort. 1860, p. 30) describes *Celtis Davidiana* as a new species from Peking. Although he had not seen either the flowers or the fruit, but only the leaves, he declares it \"une esp\u00e8ce tr\u00e8s distincte par ses feuilles.\" Planchon (D. C. Prodr. XVII, p. 172) maintains this species, but considers it as imperfectly known. He states however: A *C. sinensi* differt foliis basi minus obtusis nunquam subcordatis, reticulo nervulorum laxo et vix conspicuo nec densiusculo et prominente, colore l\u00e6te viridi nec exsiccatione rufidulo\u2014a *C. Bungrana* (also described as a Peking species) foliis saturratis viridibus nec exsiccatione glaucescentibus.\n\nThe authors, in founding a new species upon the colour of the dried leaves only, seem to be ignorant of the fact that the same leaves, according to the method of drying them (quickly or slowly), often assume very different colours. Old leaves are much darker than young leaves of the same tree. Sometimes, as in the case of *Sophora japonica*, the leaves of young specimens are quite different in shape from those of old trees. Maximowicz, who has had ample opportunity of elucidating this question with the help of the Peking specimens of *Celtis* in the herbaria of St. Petersburg, refers them all to *C. sinensis* Pers. (see his Decas. XIII, p. 27), and identifies the latter also with Thunberg's *C. orientalis* of Japan.\n(C. japonica Planch.). My own experience agrees with Maximowicz's view. I am not able to distinguish more than one species of Celtis in the neighbourhood of Peking, where the tree is frequently seen in the plain and in the mountains. Its leaves vary in shape on the same tree, being generally ovate, oblong, but sometimes also cordate. They are either perfectly smooth or rough to the touch (especially on young trees). I have sent specimens with variously shaped leaves on the same branch to the Mus\u00e9um d'Histoire naturelle de Paris. Its drupes are always black when ripe. A specimen of the Peking tree sent in 1860 to Dr. Hance was determined as C. sinensis. The latter is mentioned also in the Flora hongkongensis.\n\nCarri\u00e8re describes also (Revue Hort. 1867, p. 340) two new Poplars from China, again only from a few leaves he had received, viz.: Populus tomentosa and P. Simonii, although it is known that the leaves of some Poplars are very liable to variation. Maximowicz thinks (Fragm. Flora Asiae orient. p. 40) that the first is the common Populus alba.\n\nIn another instance Carri\u00e8re does not hesitate to apply the new name of Ailanthus flavescens to a young plant received from China and cultivated in Paris (Revue Hort. 1865, p. 366). But when ten years later the tree first flowered, it turned out to be Cedrela sinensis Adr. Juss., belonging to quite a different order (ibid. 1875, p. 86).\n\nThe same French botanist (ibid. 1867, p. 451; 1868, p. 10; 1870, p. 17) has named four (supposed) new species of Ampelopsis from North-China, viz.: A. palmata, A. distenta, A. tuberosa, and A. napiformis. He was evidently not aware that the Flora of North-China had been previously studied by Dr. Bunge, who described the same plants under other good specific names; and thus Carri\u00e8re produced four useless new names.\n\nBotanists in Europe, when receiving cultivated specimens from foreign countries, generally have no scruples in describing them as new species, without taking into consideration the variations which cultivation may have brought about in these plants. Thus Gossypium Nanking. Meyen, Nicotiana chinensis Fisch. (D. C. Prodr. XIII, 1, 550), and Atena chinensis Steudel (Gram. 231),\nhave been put forward as new species cultivated in China, and not known from elsewhere. But it is a well-established fact that Cotton was unknown in China before the 6th century, and that its cultivation in this country began only in the 11th century. Tobacco, introduced from Manila in the 17th century, was previously unknown in China. *Acena chinensis*, considered by some botanists a variety of our European *A. nuda*, is even not distinguishable from the latter species.\n\nThis unhappy tendency of botanists to discover new species even among common cultivated plants renders the interesting researches into the geographical distribution of plants and the history of cultivated species very difficult, and leads to erroneous conclusions. It seems to me of greater interest to prove that the range of a known European plant extends as far as Eastern Asia, than to discover there one or more new species of the same genus.\n\n*Artemisia indica* L., *A. igniaria* Maxim., and *A. lavandulifolius* D. C. have been described as distinct Chinese species. Maximowicz has shown (Decas. XI, 636) that they are all identical with the common European *A. vulgaris* L., or slight varieties of it.\n\n*Galium paeoniflorum* Bge. (Peking), *G. sororium* Hance, and *G. striatum* Thbg. (Japan), are according to the same author (D. XVI, 250) all identical with our common *G. Aparine* L.\n\nIn the same way Maximowicz considers *Ulmus pumila* Pall. (Eastern Siberia, Mongolia, North-China) as a variety of our common *Ulmus campestris* L. Planchon's *U. Davidiana* from North-China seems also to belong to the same species.\n\nThe multiplication of synonyms, increasing every year, and the conflict of opinion of authors as to the place and rank to be assigned to a plant in the system, have become a serious evil and inconvenience to all who have to deal with modern botany. It is impossible to obtain any uniformity of view among authors in this regard. Owing to this unsettled state of nomenclature in botanical science, the original design aimed at in giving a name to a plant, i.e. to distinguish it at once from other plants, becomes quite ineffective. Sometimes it may be more intelligible to quote a popular name of a plant than a scientific one.\n\nCollectors, who may send the same plants for determination to several competent botanists, will be struck when comparing the\nlists of the determined species, by the disagreement between the botanists in many instances, which it is sometimes impossible to account for. What does this prove? Certainly not the inadequacy of the botanists who determine the plants, but rather the difficulty of drawing in every case a clear line of distinction between two or several species. In order to convince himself how widely the opinions of different authors diverge with respect to the same plant, its place in the system and its specific name, the reader has only to compare the various monographs on Roses, Allium, Iris, Diospyros, etc. published during the last few years,\u2014or he may open any volume or page of De Candolle's Prodromus and examine the host of synonyms found there, and the errors which botanists impute to each other.\n\nIt is a remarkable fact that those botanists who dispose of vast materials, and who in their investigations can refer to a great number of species of the same genus, as for instance the authors of the Genera Plantarum in London, and the botanists of St. Petersburg, are generally inclined to generalize and, while admitting a wide range of specific variations, to restrict the number of species; for they are often called upon to compare a long series of intermediate forms standing between two seemingly quite distinct species, but connected by transitions, and they then have the alternative of combining the two species and the intermediaries into one species with several varieties, or of creating a great number of new specific names. The sound and practical view entertained in this regard by eminent and experienced authors should be more generally adopted and appreciated than is the case. The question is not to recognize a \"scientific truth,\" but merely to assent to a \"practical rule\" in the way of generalizing and simplifying the intricate state of botanical nomenclature, which will render systematic botany more useful and accessible for reference.\n\nAfter this digression from the main subject of our investigations let us now show what has been already done in the way of scientific determination of the plants mentioned in Chinese books.\nAs has been detailed in a lately published paper on the early history of botanical discoveries in China, it is to the Jesuit missionaries that we are indebted for the earliest notices of the more conspicuous plants of China and their native names; but their early publications on botanical matters contain merely popular descriptions and accounts of Chinese plants, and do not deal with scientific names. The first scientific work treating of the Flora of China which attempts to give the Chinese equivalents for the botanical names of some Chinese plants, is Loureiro's *Flora cochinchinensis*, 1788. I should also mention in this place Osbeck's *Voyage to China and the East-Indies*, published about thirty years earlier than the *Flora cochin*. Osbeck, in enumerating and describing 244 plants which he had collected near Canton and which had been determined by Linn\u00e6us, occasionally gives the transliterated Chinese names, but these are generally sadly perverted. As regards the Chinese names of plants found in Loureiro's book, they are for the greater part correct, and have subsequently served as a basis for investigations of the same kind.\n\nIn 1822 Morrison gave in his *English and Chinese Dictionary*, p. 174, under the head of \"Flowers,\" a list of plants which flower in each month of the year in Canton, containing 148 native and scientific names, for which Morrison states he was indebted to J. Reeves. J. Russel Reeves, who died in 1877, aged 73 years, resided for a long time in Canton. He was in the East-India Company's service, and seems to have arrived in China about 1815. Reeves was an able naturalist and made valuable botanical collections. He published an account of some of the articles of the Materia medica employed by the Chinese. 1826.\n\nThe 14th chapter of Bridgman's *Chinese Chrestomathy* (Macao 1841) deals with Chinese Botany. This as well as the two other chapters on Natural History (13 and 15, Mineralogy and Zoology) were prepared by Dr. S. Wells Williams, the well-known sinologue, now Professor at New Haven. We find there 445 names of Chinese plants, with the corresponding popular English or scientific appellations.\n\nA similar list, comprising 353 names of Chinese plants, is given in Dr. Williams' *English and Chinese Vocabulary* in the *Chinese Dictionary* (Macao 1844, under the word \"Flower.\" It seems\nthat these identifications have partly been derived from Loureiro's Flora cochinchinensis.\n\nIn the same year Dr. Williams published the first edition of his valuable Chinese Commercial Guide, the 5th and last edition of which appeared in 1863. In the chapter devoted to Chinese Articles of Export a good many scientific names of Chinese economic plants are found. The first attempt to examine the Chinese articles of export, or to bring together the scattered notices of them, had previously been made by Morrison. See \"Chinese Repository\" II. 1834, p. 447\u2014472. The Report of the commercial delegates attached to the French Embassy of M. de Lagr\u00e9ne, 1844\u201446 (see \u00c9tude pratique du Commerce d'Exportation en Chine, par N. Rondot, 1848), was also made use of in the compilation of the later editions of Dr. Williams' Commercial Guide. But there is a great deal of original matter to be found in this book, and a sound critical sense displayed in utilizing the material furnished by previous authors.\n\nAn article published in Vol. VII. (1848) of the \"Repertorium f\u00fcr Pharmacie und praktische Chemie in Russland,\" p. 565 sq., by G. Gauger, and entitled Chinesische Rokarzneiwaaren, may be considered as the first attempt to examine and describe Chinese drugs. The 54 Chinese drugs described by Gauger were placed in his hands by Dr. P. Kirilov, who from 1832 to 1840 was attached as a physician to the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission at Peking, and whose name is connected with many new Peking plants transmitted to the Botanical Gardens of St. Petersburg, or to his friend N. Turezaninov. Gauger gives a detailed description of these drugs and of their physical properties, accompanied by drawings. The Chinese names are also added, but only in European spelling. As regards the botanical origin of these drugs, Gauger ventures in a few cases only some suggestions.\n\nDr. A. Tatarinov's Catalogus Medicamentorum sinensium, published at St. Petersburg in 1856, has a far higher value. Tatari-\n\n---\n\n46 Andr. Clever, of whom I shall speak further on, published in 1832 a small treatise: Medicamenta simplicia Chinesica, enumerating 289 Chinese drugs with the Chinese names according to the Portuguese orthography. But this pamphlet, translated by Father M. Roym from some Chinese treatise, and without annotations or identifications, has no scientific value.\nnov resided in Peking from 1840 to 1850 as physician to the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission. During his long sojourn there he zealously applied himself to the study of the Flora of North-China. He forwarded large botanical collections to the Academy and the Botanical Gardens of St. Petersburg. The Chinese names of the plants are frequently given on the labels attached to his specimens. The Catalogus contains the Chinese names in Chinese characters, with their sounds expressed both in Russian and Latin spelling, of 480 drugs, for the greater part collected by Tatarinov in the Peking apothecaries' shops, and subsequently examined and determined by Prof. Horarinov of St. Petersburg. The scientific names of the Peking plants yielding these drugs were determined from direct examination of the plants collected by Tatarinov. As to the rest the authors seem to rely upon Loureiro and Grosier (Description de la Chine, 1819). All the drugs previously described by Gauger appear also in Tatarinov's list.\n\nBesides these collections Tatarinov presented to the Academy a beautiful set of botanical drawings representing 452 wild plants of the Peking Flora. These carefully coloured drawings, showing also the botanical details of each specimen, were executed from nature by a Chinese artist under the direction of Tatarinov, who also added the Chinese names in Chinese characters. Dried specimens of the same plants are to be found in the St. Petersburg herbaria.\n\nIn 1859 Tatarinov accompanied General Ignatiev as interpreter to Peking. He retired from service a long time ago, and now lives in Penza, his native city.\n\nI have seen a series of illustrations of Chinese plants similar to those in Tatarinov's collection in the possession of Mr. C. A. de Scatchkoff, who was Director of the Russian Meteorological Observatory in Peking from 1850 to 1857, and subsequently Russian Consul in Kuldja and Consul-General in Shanghai. Mr. Scatchkoff, who devoted himself to the investigation of Chinese Agriculture, and who has published many interesting papers on the subject, has also transmitted valuable botanical collections (comprising many cultivated plants) to St. Petersburg, where they have been determined. In the memoranda accompanying his specimens the Chinese names are generally given. He had\nengaged a Chinese artist to paint for him from nature the economic and ornamental plants cultivated at Peking. These valuable drawings give also the botanical details of each plant.\n\nAs has been stated in a previous chapter, the Japanese early adopted Chinese names for their medicinal, economic and other plants. But, although they have generally tried to apply a Chinese appellation of a plant to the same plant in Japan, it often happens that a plant in Japan bearing the same name as in China belongs to a different species; in some instances even quite dissimilar plants are designated by the same Chinese characters in the two countries.\n\nThe first attempt of a European to study the Flora of Japan was made by Andr. Cleyer, a German, who visited Yeddo in 1683 as envoy of the Dutch East-India Company, and resided in Nagasaki as chief supercargo of the Dutch factory till 1686. His letters on Japanese plants addressed to Dr. Mentzel have been published in the Academiae naturae curiosorum Ephemerides, 1686\u20141700. Cleyer's descriptions as well as the drawings appended have little value. The Japanese names are sadly perverted. Sprengel in his \"Geschichte der Botanik,\" II. 68, gives the scientific names of as many of Cleyer's plants as it was possible to ascertain. The botanist Ch. H. Erndtel, in a letter dated Dresden 1716 and addressed to Jac. Breyn of Dantzig, refers to a collection of 1380 Japanese drawings of plants on paper of the Paper mulberry, which Mentzel had received from Cleyer and which he had subsequently presented to the Royal Library at Berlin. In 1878, when I visited Berlin, I saw these drawings and was much disappointed, for they were miserably and inaccurately executed, and have no scientific value. The paper used is of an inferior kind and not that manufactured from the bark of Broussonetia papyrifera, as Erndtel asserts.\n\nBut there is in the same Library another volume entitled Cleyer's Flora japonica, containing only 101 coloured drawings of Japanese plants, apparently painted from nature in Japan by Cleyer's order. These have more claim to botanical correctness. Cleyer has himself added some memoranda. The names are given in Japanese letters only. This volume was referred to Dr. Siebold, who in 1856 drew up an Index of the drawings and added the scientific botanical names.\nA few years after Cleyer had left Japan, another German, an able explorer and botanist, arrived in that country and spent about two years there. Engelberth Kaempfer was born in 1651 at Lemgo (Lippe-Detmold). In 1683 he accompanied a Swedish Embassy to Persia as Secretary, but on its return he separated from it and proceeded to the Persian Gulf, where a Dutch fleet was stationed at that time. In 1685 he entered the service of the Dutch East-India Company as a surgeon, and arrived at Batavia in 1689. In the following year a Dutch squadron was sent out to Siam and Japan, and Kaempfer was of the party. On the 22nd September 1690 he reached Nagasaki. He had two opportunities of visiting Yeddo, performing the journey thither partly by the overland road, partly by sea. His first stay in Yeddo lasted from March 13 to April 5, 1691; the second from March 31 to April 20, 1692. He left Japan in the same year, returned to Europe in 1694, and died in 1716 in his native country. For further biographical details regarding Kaempfer see Rosny's \"Vari\u00e9t\u00e9s orientales,\" 1872, p. 98, where an interesting account of his life and his scientific works is found. Kaempfer was not only a skillful botanist, but an acute observer in general. He has connected his name imperishably with the history of botanical discoveries in Japan, and the accounts he noted down with respect to the Japanese Empire and other countries he visited will always stand as a model of accurate and judicious information and keen observation. In 1712 he brought out his *Amoenitates Exotic\u00e6*. The second fasciculus (p. 466) contains an account of the plants from which paper is manufactured in Japan; in the third fasciculus (p. 605) a treatise on the Tea-shrub is found. Besides this the whole of the fifth fasciculus (p. 767\u2014912) is devoted to the description of more than 500 species of Japanese plants, 31 of which are represented by excellent drawings. The Japanese names of the plants are always given, and Chinese names in Chinese characters are generally added. Although these characters are often wrongly or indistinctly printed, there is no difficulty in deciphering them. Kaempfer's botanical descriptions are generally faithful, in some instances much detailed.\n\nThe *Amoenitates Exotic\u00e6* represents only a small portion of\nKaempfer's labours. After his death all his unpublished manuscripts as well as his herbarium, namely the plants collected in Japan and his drawings of Japanese plants, were purchased by Hans Sloane, the well-known collector and promoter of science, whose immense collections subsequently gave origin to the British Museum. In 1727 Kaempfer's valuable History of Japan, etc. was published in English, translated from his original (Dutch) manuscript. In 1791 Sir J. Banks edited a volume with the title: Icones selectae plantarum quas in Japonia colligit et delineavit E. Kaempfer, ex archetyp. in Museo Britannico asservatis. It contains 59 plates.\n\nAfter Kaempfer the first botanist to visit Japan was C. P. Thunberg, a Swede, born in 1743, died in 1822. He landed at Nagasaki in 1775, and on the 4th March of 1776 proceeded by the overland route to Yeddo, where he arrived on the 30th June. As the fruit of the botanical collections made during his stay in Japan he published in 1784 his Flora japonica, to which 39 drawings of Japanese plants are appended. Besides this he published in 1794 his Icones Plantarum japonicarum, 50 plates. I have seen in St. Petersburg another unpublished volume of drawings representing Japanese plants, executed from nature by order of Thunberg. As a scientific botanical nomenclature did not exist at the time when Kaempfer wrote, Thunberg tried to name those Japanese plants described in the Amoenitates exotic\u00e6, which had not been previously determined and named by Linnaeus, and to identify the native names mentioned by Kaempfer.\n\nMuch more was done in this respect by Dr. Siebold, the well-known and ardent explorer of Japan.\u2014Ph. Fr. v. Siebold, a German, was born in 1796 in W\u00fcrzburg. After having studied medicine and natural sciences he went to Holland, and entering the service of the Dutch East-India Company, set out for Batavia, where he arrived in 1822. The next year he was sent as a physician and naturalist to Japan. He lived several years in the Dutch Factory at Decima (Nagasaki). In 1826 he had an opportunity of visiting Yeddo. As the Japanese government suspected him of being in possession of a map of Japan, he was obliged to leave the country in 1830, and returned to Europe,\nwhere he employed himself for several years in publishing the results of his researches in Japan. In 1859 he went again to that country, where he lived till 1862. He died at Munich in 1866.\u2014Siebold had forwarded one portion of his vast botanical collections accumulated in Japan to Prof. C. L. Blume in Java, who described some of these plants in the Museum botanicum Lugduno-Batavorum, 1849\u201451. H. Zollinger published a few years later an Index of Siebold's plants in the Java Herbarium (Buitenzorg). The greater part of his dried plants, however, had been transmitted by Siebold to the Museum of Leyden, and from these materials Prof. Miquel compiled his Prolusio Flora japonicae, 1865\u201467. Siebold himself, with the assistance of Prof. J. G. Zuccarini of Munich, had commenced much earlier to describe his Japanese botanical collections, but their publications were left in a fragmentary state. The most interesting of them is the Flora japonicae, sive plantae quae in Imperio Japonico collegit, descriptit, ex parte in ipse locis pingendas curavit Dr. Ph. Fr. de Siebold, digessit Dr. Zuccarini, 1835\u20141844, 127 plates. Miquel attempted to continue this iconographical work and published, from 1868\u20141870, 23 additional plates. The original drawings to which Siebold alludes on the title pages (about 600) have been purchased, together with a set of Siebold's dried Japanese plants, from his widow, by the Academy of St. Petersburg. The drawings form eight large volumes and are beautifully executed.\n\nSiebold always tried to ascertain the Japanese names of the plants he gathered, and also noted down the Chinese characters applied in Japan to these plants. He was assisted in this task by native botanists, and we can, I think, assume that his identifications are quite reliable.\n\nIn 1852 J. Hoffmann and H. Schultes published a small pamphlet entitled: Noms indig\u00e8nes d'un choix de Plantes du Japon et de la Chine, d'apr\u00e8s les \u00e9chantillons de l'herbier des Pays Bas. A new enlarged edition of this list was issued in 1864. It is an\n\n---\n\n46 I know only the 127 plates published by Siebold and Zuccarini. Franchet and Savatier, Enum. plant. Japan., Pref. XIII., state that in all 175 of these plates have been published, but in the second vol. p. 668 the authors assign to the Flora japonicae 150 plates only.\nIndex of 6\u2014700 plants of Japan (not of China, as might be inferred from the title), with the scientific botanical names and their equivalents in Japanese and in Chinese characters used in Japan to designate these plants. The authors of this list depend entirely upon Siebold's identifications, and, as has been already explained, it is a mistake on their part to assert that the Chinese characters they give are always referred by the natives to the same plants, both in Japan and in China.\n\nThe late Dan. Hanbury, well known for his numerous papers elucidating the history and the botanical origin of drugs, described in the \"Pharmaceutical Journal,\" 1860\u201461, a collection of Chinese drugs, received from Shanghai, under the title of Notes on Chinese Materia medica. It was reprinted, after the author's death, in 1875, by J. Ince in D. Hanbury's Science Papers, p. 209\u2014277. This pamphlet, illustrated by numerous wood-cuts, and giving the Chinese names in Chinese characters of 141 drugs, 83 of which are derived from the vegetable kingdom, is a very valuable contribution to our knowledge of Chinese Materia medica.\n\nThe same cannot be said with respect to the Essai sur la Pharmacie et la Mati\u00e8re m\u00e9dicale des Chinois, published in 1865 by a French Pharmacologist, O. Debeaux. He was attached to the French army in China in 1860, and had an opportunity of making botanical and other collections at several places in China. He is also the author of an article on the Tinctorial Plants of China, of a Florula of Shanghai (1875), a Florula of Chefoo (1877), and a Florula of Tientsin (1879). In all these papers we meet with a profusion of Chinese names of plants expressed in French spelling, but in the majority of cases they have no resemblance to the real ones. In my article: On the Study and Value of Chinese Botanical Works (1871), p. 47, 48, I have given some specimens of the information supplied by Debeaux with respect to Chinese Botany, and shall therefore not return to the subject.\n\nTen years ago (1871) Dr. Fr. Porter Smith brought out a book with the title Contributions towards the Materia medica and Natural History of China, which has often been quoted as a standard work in this department by people who cannot discern its real\nvalue, and who rely upon the assurance with which the author's information is presented. Dr. P. Smith's book indeed contains notices of a great number of Chinese drugs: Chinese and scientific names are always given and identified without any hesitation. One might believe that Chinese Pharmacology is as well known to Europeans as our own drugs are to us, and that Dr. P. Smith has left nothing to be done in this department. But if any one attempts to examine the matter thoroughly, he will soon be aware of the arbitrary character of his identifications and of the insufficiency of the knowledge we really possess with regard to Chinese drugs and economic plants. Thus, P. Smith's scientific denominations of Chinese plants, being drawn without any critical discernment from trustworthy and untrustworthy sources, have little value and render his book unreliable for any scientific purpose. It cannot however be denied that there are in it many interesting accounts, translated from Chinese works, relating to the medical virtues ascribed by the Chinese to their drugs.\n\nThree years after P. Smith's book on Chinese Materia medica was published, a compilation of the same character appeared in French, with the title: *La Mati\u00e8re m\u00e9dicale chez les Chinois*, par le Dr. J. L. Soubeiran et M. Dabry de Thiersant, Consul de France en Chine, 1874. Although professing to be an original work, it is nothing but a compilation from P. Smith and Debeaux, made without criticism and without the Chinese characters of the native names. The best portion of the book is the able preface by Prof. Gubler.4\n\nSuch are the sources from which in Anglo-Chinese Dictionaries of later date, and also in the Reports on Trade at the Chinese\n\n---\n\n47 In a letter addressed to me by my late friend Dan. Hanbury, in Dec. 1873, I find the following passage:\n\n\"I recently forwarded to you Soubeiran and Dabry's work on Chin. Materia medica\u2014not on account of its scientific value, which is small indeed, but because it is proper that you should have at hand all such books, good or bad. What can we say of such statements as that the Dragon's Blood of the Chinese is derived from *Pterocarpus Draco*, a tree only known to grow in Tropical America? Or that the *Valeriana colchica* of the Styrian Alps grows in Szechuen and Shensi? or that *Santalum Frey-cinestansum*, a native of the Sandwich Islands, is found in Cochinchina? (p. 278, 160, 157), and many, many similar assertions for which no 'pi\u00e8ces justificatives' are offered. It is impossible to speak with commendation of this work. It is largely copied from P. Smith, whose errors it adopts and repeats.\"\nTreaty Ports, the scientific names for Chinese plants have been derived. The authors of these dictionaries generally rely upon P. Smith, and it is to be regretted that such names as for instance *Corchorus pyriformis*, *Cucumis longa*, given by him as scientific denominations, but unintelligible to botanists, have found their way from his Chinese Materia medica even into Dr. Williams' valuable dictionary (p. 861, 466). The latter gives generally, as far as Chinese Botany is concerned, the best information obtainable.\n\nI should not close these remarks without cautioning the student of Chinese Botany against a French essay towards identifying Chinese names of plants, which was published ten years ago, and is the worst of its kind we have had the misfortune to notice. It is from the untrustworthy pen of P. Perny, and appeared as an appendix to his *Dictionnaire Fran\u00e7ais-Latin-Chinois*, 1872, a pretentious work beautifully printed, but which, I am sorry to say, puts sinologues to blush. As to the botanical part, the author says (General Preface and Preface to the Appendix on Natural History): \"La synonymie que nous donnons ici est probablement la plus compl\u00e8te qui ait parue jusqu'\u00e0 ce jour\" (he should have added \"et la plus erron\u00e9e\"). Indeed Perny identifies 2375 names of Chinese plants. He reproduces occasionally previously-made identifications (Hoffmann and Schultes, Williams), but the bulk of the \"synonymie\" is peculiar to the author's \"researches.\" We may ask how he succeeded in bringing together such a mass of erroneous notions on the most common and generally known subjects, for it is not too much to say that it is difficult to meet with one correct statement in this essay. Even a student of Chinese unacquainted with Chinese Botany knows that \u7a3b\u5b50 *ku tsz* is not *Rice*, as Perny asserts (1993), but *Millet* (*Setaria italica*); that \u5c0f\u9ea6 *siao mai* is not *Rye* (2136), but *Wheat*; that \u67cf *po* is not *Stillingia arbifera* (2201), but *Thuja*, or sometimes the *Cypress*; that \u767d\u67cf *po yang* is not the *Cypress* (852), but the *Poplar*; and that the Water-melon is not \u846b\u82a6\u74dc *kua* (which is a *Luffa*), and also not \u897f\u74dc *si kua* (1744), but \u846b\u82a6\u74dc *kua*.\nCHAPTER III.\n\nALPHABETICAL LIST OF CHINESE WORKS AND AUTHORS.\n\nHaving given in a previous chapter a sketch of the principal Chinese treatises on Materia medica, Botany, Agriculture, etc., I now venture to offer a more complete enumeration, not only of such Chinese works as relate to that branch of literature, but of many other writings on Medicine, History, Geography, Philosophy, etc., which are frequently quoted in the Pen ts'ao kang mu and other works of the same class.\n\nAttention has already been drawn in a previous chapter to the great difficulty which a student of Chinese botanical writings has to contend with in ascertaining the time when the numerous works quoted in these writings were composed. We have to seek information about them in numerous Chinese bibliographical works not always readily accessible. It is therefore not surprising that European sinologues, in translating Chinese botanical articles, generally confine themselves to the expression \"a Chinese author says,\" without attempting to give the date of the publications they quote. Even in the translations made from Chinese works on Natural History and Agriculture by the great sinologue Stan. Julien (see for instance his \"Culture des Muriers en Chine\") we seldom find any indication of time with respect to the quotations he translates.\n\nI have endeavoured to elucidate this question as far as possible, and to ascertain from various sources the time to which the authors and works quoted in the Pen ts'ao kang mu belong. My list will also be found to contain many other titles of Chinese works mentioned in the Kuang k\u00fcn fang pu, the Chi wu ming shi t'u k'ao, the T'u shu ts'ai ch'eng, etc. It is hoped that it will afford some assistance to those who wish to study Chinese books on Natural History, and that it will prepare the reader for the better comprehension and appreciation of these writings.\n\nLi Shi chen, the author of the Pen ts'ao kang mu, assumes on the part of his readers a most extensive knowledge of Chinese\nliterature, as in quoting works and authors he never deems it necessary to give the full title, or the full names, of the authors whose patronymic appellation he frequently omits, giving only the cognomen. Thus, for instance, by \u5f9e\u6b63 he means \u5f35\u5f9e\u6b63 Chang Ts'ung cheng (an author of the Kin dynasty); by \u6a29 he means \u6c6a\u6a29 Wang Ki (Ming dynasty). It is known that every author, besides his patronymic (\u59d3) and his cognomen (\u540d), possesses also a literary appellation (\u5b57) and one or more pseudonyms (\u865f). By all these names he is promiscuously designated, and their identity can only be proved by referring to his biography. Sometimes the name of an author is ambiguous.\n\n\u5927\u660e Ta Ming is an author's name as well as that of the Great Ming dynasty. \u5510 T'ang and \u5b8b Sung are patronymic denominations as well as names applied to Chinese dynasties. Thus the authors' names \u5510\u614e\u5fae T'ang Shen wei and \u5b8b\u738b\u5fae Sung Wang wei may either refer to Shen wei, an author of the T'ang dynasty, or to Wang wei, an author of the Sung.\u2014There were two Sung dynasties in China; one in the 5th century, the other from the 10th to the 13th century. There was also a state called Sung in China 500 or 600 years B.C. The Chinese, when indicating the time of an author, are accustomed to give the name of the dynasty, but in the case of the character Sung we are often left in doubt what time is meant.\u2014It sometimes occurs also that authors of different dates bear the same name. There was a celebrated author \u5468\u5bc6 Chou Mi in the 13th century. Authors of the same name wrote in the 4th and 10th centuries. \u5f35\u83ef Chang Hua was an author of the 3rd century. We find the same name among the authors of the Sung.\n\nBefore giving the results of my researches into Chinese literature, I may be allowed to notice briefly the general works from which information has been derived in order to ascertain the date of publication and other particulars regarding works and authors frequently quoted in Chinese writings on Natural History and Medicine.\n\nLi Shi chen, in the first chapter of his Pen ts'ao kang mu, puts at the head of his work a list of nearly 1000 works and authors from which he made extracts for the compilation of his Materia\nmedica. They are enumerated under three heads and several subdivisions, viz.:\n\nI. History of Chinese Materia medica. Review of 42 Chinese standard works of this class (already dealt with in the first chapter of these notes).\n\nII. Medical Treatises.\n   a. Titles of 84 works quoted in the ancient Pen ts'ao (or Treatises on Materia medica) previous to Li Shi chen.\n   b. Additional list of 276 works first quoted by Li Shi chen.\n\nIII. Classical, historical, geographical, philosophical and other works.\n   a. Titles of 150 works quoted in the ancient Pen ts'ao.\n   b. Additional list of 440 works first quoted by Li Shi chen.\n\nUnder the second and third heads are comprised dry lists, arranged in no intelligible order, without any indication of period, giving nothing but the name of the author together with the title of the book. Sometimes the author's name is omitted. As there is no break between the name of the author and that of the work, it is in many cases difficult, even for a Chinese scholar, to separate them, or to decide whether the name of a book or an author is meant. There is no doubt that a large number of the works quoted in the Pen ts'ao kang mu were already lost when it was compiled, and that Li Shi chen's quotations were merely taken from previous works on Materia medica, especially, as he himself intimates, from the Pen ts'ao compiled in the 12th century by T'ang Shen wei. (See above Hist. Chin. Mat. med. No. 26.)\n\nAs regards the sources of my information on Chinese Bibliography, I would in the first place mention A. Wylie's admirable Notes on Chinese Literature, which without doubt occupies one of the most prominent places among European scientific publications on China. It is a matter of regret that the eminent author has generally confined himself in his investigations to such works as he knew from actual examination. Thus the greater part of the works and authors met with in the Pen ts'ao do not appear in Wylie's book. Besides this some biographical notices referring to Chinese authors have occasionally been derived from the late W. F. Mayers' well-known Chinese Reader's Manual. But for the bulk of Chinese\nauthors and works appearing in the subsequent list, information has been drawn from Chinese bibliographical works, catalogues, collections of reprints, etc.\n\nIn the first place I consulted the \u56db\u5eab\u5168\u66f8\u7e3d\u76ee S\u00e8' k'\u00f9 ts'\u00ecan shu tsung mu (abbrev. S. K.), the great descriptive catalogue of the Imperial library, in 200 books, completed in 1790; and the abridgment of it, the \u56db\u5eab\u5168\u66f8\u7c21\u660e\u76ee\u9304 S\u00e8' k'\u00f9 ts'\u00ecan shu kien ming mu hs (abbrev. S. K. K.), in 20 books. I quote the latter, which is more accessible, in preference, and refer to the larger catalogue only for the works omitted in the abridged edition.\u2014There is yet another abridgment of the larger catalogue, published at the same time, with the title \u56db\u5eab\u5168\u66f8\u76ee\u7565 S\u00e8' k'\u00f9 ts'\u00ecan shu mu l\u00f2. It gives only the titles, the authors' names, and the date of publication of the works, but enumerates all works found in the large catalogue.\n\nThe well-known Encyclopaedia \u6587\u737b\u901a\u8003 Wen kien t'ung k'ao (abbrev. W. H.), compiled in the beginning of the 14th century by Ma Tuan lin, contains 75 books (174\u2014249), dealing with Bibliography, \u7d93\u7c4d king tsi. It furnishes interesting details on many ancient Chinese works now lost.\n\nA supplement to it was published in 1586 under the title S\u00e8 (\u7e8c) Wen kien t'ung k'ao. It includes 16 chapters (172\u2014188) on Bibliography.\n\nSome of the Dynastic Histories give in a separate section on Bibliography lists of works existing during the respective dynasties, but generally without explanatory details or indication of date of publication.\n\nThe earliest catalogue of this kind is found in the \u524d\u6f22\u66f8 Ti\u00ean Han shu, or History of the Former Han, book 30 \u85dd\u6587\u5fd7 i wen chi (abbrev. HAN LIT.). It refers to the close of the first century B. C.\n\nThe next bibliographical compilation is found in the \u968b\u66f8 Sui shu, History of the Sui (A.D. 589\u2014618), books 32\u201435, \u7d93\u7c4d. It enumerates the works published during this and the preceding dynasties (abbrev. SUI LIT.).\n\nThe \u5510\u66f8 T'ang shu, or History of the T'ang (A.D. 618\u2014907). There are several works of this name, the Kiu (old), and the Sia (new) T'ang shu, dating from the 9th and 11th centuries. I\nalways refer to the \u5510\u66f8\u5408\u7de8 T'ang shu ho ch'ao, a combination of both, published in 1783. The section on literature, king tsi, is comprised in books 72\u201475 (abbrev. T'ANG LIT.).\n\nThe \u5b8b\u53f2 Sung shi, or History of the Sung (A.D. 960\u20141280). Section on literature, i wen, books 202-209). (Abbrev. SUNG LIT.).\n\nThe \u660e\u53f2 Ming shi, or History of the Ming (A.D. 1368\u20141644). Section on literature, i wen, books 96\u201499. (Abbrev. MING LIT.).\n\nThe Great Encyclopaedia \u592a\u5e73\u5fa1\u89bd T'ai p'ing yu lan, in 1000 books, published in 983, gives at the beginning a list of 1690 works from which quotations have been borrowed; but the time of publication is not indicated, nor are the titles arranged chronologically. (Abbrev. T. P.)\n\nThere is another Encyclopaedia, \u5947\u66f8\u8981\u5143 Shi yen yao yuan, published in 1618, in which a very interesting bibliographical compilation is found. Between 2000 and 3000 works are noticed there. The list is chronologically arranged according to the dynastic periods. The names of the authors and occasionally other particulars are given. This list has been of great assistance to me in my investigations. (Abbrev. S. Y.)\n\nMany of the minor treatises and articles quoted in the Pen ts'ao keng mu are found in the numerous \u8ad6\u53e2 Ts'ung shu, or Collections of Reprints. A catalogue of a part of these repositories was drawn up in 1799 with the title \u8ad6\u523b\u66f8\u76ee\u5408\u7de8 Hui k'o shu mu ho pien, in 10 books, enumerating all the reprinted treatises contained in each ts'ung shu. Sometimes the author's name and date of publication are given, but generally we find only the dry titles of the treatises. (Abbrev. H. K.)\n\nMuch important bibliographical information has been drawn from the following four ts'ung shu:\n\nThe \u6f22\u9b4f\u53e2\u66f8 Han Wei ts'ung shu, a collection of works written during the Han, Wei, Tsin, Liang, and Sui dynasties. The last edition reproduces nearly a hundred ancient literary works. See Wylie l. c. p. 209. (Abbrev. H. W.)\n\nThe \u4e94\u767e\u5bb6\u5c0f\u8aaa Wu po kia siao shuo, published during the Ming dynasty and reproducing 480 minor treatises by authors of the Han, Tsin, Liang, Wei, T'ang, Sung, and Ming dynasties. 48 books. (Abbrev. W. P.)\nThe \u662d\u4ee3\u53e2\u66f8 Chao tai ts'ung shu. The first edition was published in 1697; the last much enlarged edition which I have consulted bears the date of 1834. It contains 560 more or less comprehensive articles by authors of the present dynasty. (Abbrev. C. T.)\n\nThe \u56fd\u6d77 Han hai, a collection of literary productions of various times, 160 in all, published in 1783. See H. K. V. 56. (Abbrev. H. H.)\n\nWith respect to medical authors and treatises some information, not found elsewhere, has been derived from the \u6771\u91ab\u5bf6\u9451 Tung i pao k'un, a general work on Medicine of Corean origin, already mentioned. The author places at the head of his work some short bibliographical notices. (Abbrev. T. l.)\n\nTo determine the time of the authors I also consulted several Chinese biographical dictionaries, especially the \u8cde\u53cb\u9304 Shang yu lu,\u2014see Mayers' Chin. Read. Man. Pref. XVII. (abbrev. SH. Y.) \u2014and the \u53f2\u59d3\u8b5c\u7de8 Shi sing yan pien (abbrev. SH. S.), published in 1784, in 64 books, a phonetically arranged list of the names of all persons whose biographies are found in the 24 histories, giving also the patronymics and surnames, literary appellations, etc.\n\nBesides the abbreviations already given the following have been introduced into the subsequent bibliographical notes.\n\nP. = Pen ts'ao hang mu (see p. 54). The figure indicates the page of the first book of the Pen ts'ao where the title of the respective work is found.\n\nP. MAT. MED. = list of works on Materia medica in the same Pen ts'ao.\n\nK. = Huang K'un fang p'u (see p. 70).\n\nT. = T'u shu tai ch'eng (see p. 71).\n\nCH. = Chi wu ming shi t'u k'ao (see p. 72).\n\nThese are the sources from which the short bibliographical details furnished in the subsequent list of Chinese works and authors have been derived. The general works quoted above necessarily form the basis of all future investigation into Chinese literature and bibliography; but, as is generally the case with\nChinese books, reference to them is not easy. The reader will hardly imagine the trouble involved in bringing together the fragmentary information presented in the following pages. The bibliographical notices given there have no claim to completeness. The author's sole aim in compiling these notes was to ascertain the time when the works quoted in the Pen ts'ao kang mu and other Chinese books on Natural History, Materia medica and Medicine were published, without entering into details regarding the subjects dealt with in these treatises. It is generally impossible to say, from the mere title of a Chinese book, to what branch of literature it belongs; and even after an examination of the work itself it is often difficult to indicate in a few words its contents. This is especially the case with the writings classed in Chinese catalogues among the \u96dc\u5bb6 and the \u5c0f\u8aaa\u5bb6 (miscellaneous writings and essayists in Wylie's Notes on Chin. literature), and frequently quoted in the Pen ts'ao. In many cases merely the title of the work and the date of publication are given in the following list. The authors are generally quoted only if their names appear in the quotations of the Pen ts'ao. The reader who would desire more information about these works and their authors is referred to the general works on Chinese literature which are invariably quoted.\n\nAlthough I have apparently exhausted all the Chinese sources of information regarding Chinese literature obtainable in our days, I have not been able to ascertain the date of publication of all the treatises appearing in the list of the Pen ts'ao. As there are many misprints and inaccuracies in the editions of this work now extant, the titles and authors' names are occasionally misspelt. Some errors of this kind have been corrected; others may have escaped my attention. On the other hand, Li Shi chen, in quoting authors or works in his Materia medica, frequently abbreviates the title, or gives the author's pseudonym instead of his true name appearing in the list. I may be allowed to quote a few instances.\n\nThe treatise \u98f2\u81b3\u6b63\u8981 Yin shan cheng yao of the P. list med. 16 (No. 1096 of my list) is generally quoted in the text as \u6b63\u8981.\n\nP. list 26 we read \u6c88\u62ec\u4e8b\u8ac7\u7e8c\u7de8 Ch'en Kua's Meng ki pi t'an (see my list No. 510); but in the text of the Pen ts'ao the\ntitle of the same work often reads \u5b58\u4e2d\u96c6\u7fa9 (the literary name of the author was \u5b58\u4e2d).\n\nThus again the work \u738b\u683c\u6f22\u96c6 (P. list 38; my list No. 1015), writings of Wang Mei ki, is identical with the \u738b\u683c\u6f22\u96c6, quoted P. XIV. (sub mo li kua). The same author is also styled \u738b\u5341\u3002\n\nThe Pen ts'ao list of medical works gives the titles of a host of collections of medical prescriptions (\u65b9), and alchemical receipts of various periods. The origin of many of these I have not been able to ascertain. But I think that no important Chinese treatise quoted in the Pen ts'ao has been omitted in my list, where the reader who in future may investigate the History of Chinese Medicine (a field of inquiry still untrodden by European scholars), will also find a considerable amount of information on the subject.\n\n1. \u8336\u8449\u50b3 Ai ye ch'uan.

readers. I have therefore thought it serviceable to subjoin a list of about 70 of the more conspicuous hills and mountains of China proper, adding some particulars about their position, etc. My information has principally been derived from the Kuang yu ki and from the Tu Ts'ing I t'ung chi (see p. 69 and 87). I have also consulted the Tao ts'ang, or Great Repository of Taoist literature, in which a list of the mountains venerated by Taoists and of the haunted grottoes situated on them is given. This compilation dates from the 3rd cent. B.C. The Taoists distinguish first the \u5927\u6d1e\u5929 shi ta tung t'ien, the 10 Great haunted Grottoes, and besides these enumerate 36 other haunted Grottoes, \u5341\u516d\u6d1e\u5929 san shi liu tung t'ien, situated on various mountains of the Empire.\n\nFrom early times the Chinese have revered the \u4e94\u5cb3 wu yo, or five sacred mountains: one in the middle, the others in the Northern, Southern, Eastern and Western parts of the ancient Empire. Annual sacrifices were made on them by the ancient Emperors, and on a rock of the Southern mountain the Emperor Yu is believed to have engraved an inscription (see Legge's Shu king).\n\nChinese literature abounds in descriptions of these various mountains. Many of these accounts are of very early date. Several works have been published collecting the greater part of the records relating to famous mountains, or giving extracts of them. See Alphabet. List of Works, Nos. 510 and 1101a.\n1. \u8336\u5c71 Ch'a shan. Y\u00fcn nan. Tsu hiung fu, 7 li south of Nan an chou. Tea is produced on this hill.\n\n2. \u9577\u767d\u5c71 Ch'ang po shan. Shan tung.

FATHER M. DECHEVRENS, S.J.\nDirector of the Zi-ka-wei Observatory.\n\nThe ever growing importance of the study of climates cannot be called in question nowadays, and all serious minds, though sometimes apprehensive of the difficulties of such a study, are led to admit that the modifications brought about in the human organism under the influence of climate are as important as those we seek for in the practice of public and private hygiene.\n\nPrevention is better than cure: the knowledge of the various climates will effect that object, and it has been said with reason that whenever the science of hygiene shall have advanced so far as to point out to every one what country he must prefer, the power of medicine may be said to be doubled. Ages of observation go to prove that for any disease recovery is difficult in the medium where it originated; whereas it is possible to prevent the formation, or at least to stop the progress of chronic diseases by keeping off the external causes on which they depend, or by sparing to patients the impressions they would receive from such causes. But to that end one must needs be well acquainted with the characteristics of the various climates that divide the\n\n| Latitude | 31\u00b0 14' 57\" North |\n|----------|------------------|\n| Longitude| 121\u00b0 29' 8\" East of Greenwich |\n| Height   | 0 ft.            |\n\n* Read before the Society on the 28th October, 1881.\nimmense surface of our globe; otherwise the remedy sought for in a change of air or in emigration might be worse than the evil.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why Meteorology has lately assumed so great an importance.\n\nWhat is the true meaning of the word Climate and what is understood by Climatology?\n\nAncient astronomers employed the word \u03ba\u03bb\u03af\u03bc\u03b1 or region to designate the space comprised between two circles parallel to the earth's equator; such belts or climates were used to indicate the duration of days and nights from the equator to the pole. That ill-defined division of the earth into thirty climates of unequal breadth has been superseded by the system of latitudes. Hence the word Climate, in its most natural acceptation, designates a certain extent of the surface of the globe offering all over the same conditions of existence. In a word, climate is the positive influence of air, water and places on man as a unit and on men congregated in numbers and dwelling on a limited spot of the globe. Such was already the conception of climate in Hippocrates' mind, when he treated of the influence of places (\u03c4\u03cc\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd), of water (\u1f55\u03b4\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2), and of air (\u1f00\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2) for maintaining health and generating disease.\n\nClimatology is a science devoted to the study of climates; it borrows largely from Physical Geography, Geology, Hydrology, Meteorology, Medicine, and Statistics.\n\nThese then are the various sciences we must have recourse to for a complete study of the Climate of Shanghai. The importance acquired by this great mart, the trade of which has taken such a wonderful increase, would call for a serious and complete inquiry. But unable to grasp all sides of the question, I shall only bring in my share of the work and limit myself to the meteorological point of view, which after all is the most important as meteorological phenomena are those that most affect public health.\n\nI.\u2014TEMPERATURE.\n\nOf all the elements that go to make up a climate, temperature is by far the most important. Its variations are the cause of\nnearly all the other meteorological phenomena by which climates differ. It therefore always ranks first in the study of a climate.\n\nThe increase of temperature with the depth within the crust of the globe, the existence of hot springs and volcanic eruptions, all concur to prove that the heat stored up in the earth does not all proceed from the Sun. Yet, strictly speaking, it can be said that the variations of temperature at the surface are solely due to solar heat.\n\nThe mean temperature of a place, as observed by means of thermometers placed in more or less favourable situations, is dependent, more than is generally supposed, upon the nature of the soil and of everything that happens to be in the vicinity of the instruments. Generally speaking, the better all external influence be warded off, the more precautions be taken to get the thermometer in equilibrium of temperature with the air that freely scours over the country, the nearer to the truth will the results be.\n\nThe annual mean temperature of the Shanghai district, as given by eight years' uninterrupted observations made under favourable conditions at the Zi-ka-wei Observatory\u00b2 is:\n\n59.\u00b02 Fahr.\n\nAccording to Arago the isothermal line of 59\u00b0, or the line all the points of which enjoy this mean temperature, passes 0.\u00b030' North of Chapel-Hill (U.S.), through Montpellier (France), 0.\u00b020' North of Florence (Italy), 0.\u00b040' North of Athens (Greece), 1\u00b0 South of Baku (Caspian Sea), 1.\u00b05' North of Nagasaki (Japan). This line is far from corresponding to the parallel of Shanghai (31\u00b0), which crosses Texas, passes through Morocco, Alexandria and Lahore, countries and towns which all have a much higher mean temperature than Shanghai. The isothermal line of 59\u00b0 is considerably deflected to the South on reaching the Eastern coast of Asia.\n\nAll the points of an isothermal line do not enjoy the same climate, since a climate with regard to temperature may either be extreme or temperate according as the mean temperatures of\n\n\u00b2 The Zi-ka-wei Observatory (French Jesuit missionaries), 3.5 miles S.W. of Shanghai.\nWinter and Summer differ more or less. Thus at Yakutsk (Siberia) the annual range of mean monthly temperature, or the difference between the mean temperatures of January and of July, is $104.7^\\circ$, an enormous variation if compared with Bangkok (Siam) where it does not exceed $5.4^\\circ$. At Shanghai the annual variation of monthly temperature is $45.8^\\circ$, indicating a rather severe climate.\n\nThe mean temperatures of the four seasons, from eight years' observations, are:\n\n- Winter $89.1^\\circ$\n- Spring $56.9^\\circ$\n- Summer $78.2^\\circ$\n- Autumn $62.6^\\circ$\n\nThe mean temperature for each month is as follows:\n\n- January $35.8^\\circ$\n- February $39.6^\\circ$\n- March $46.8^\\circ$\n- April $57.2^\\circ$\n- May $66.9^\\circ$\n- June $73.4^\\circ$\n- July $81.1^\\circ$\n- August $80.1^\\circ$\n- September $73.4^\\circ$\n- October $63.8^\\circ$\n- November $51.3^\\circ$\n- December $41.9^\\circ$\n\nIt may be both interesting and useful to know the mean temperature of all the days of the year to be enabled to foretell changes of weather with some degree of probability. The following table gives the mean temperatures of each five days, as deduced from all the observations of the last 8 years (1873-1880). One may notice the coldest day on January 5th ($30.6^\\circ$) and the hottest on July 6th ($83.7^\\circ$), giving a range of $53.1^\\circ$.\n\n**Mean temperature at Shanghai for each five days.**\n\n| From 1 to 5 January | 33.8 |\n|---------------------|------|\n| 6 - 10              | 36.0 |\n| 11 - 15             | 36.0 |\n| 16 - 20             | 36.4 |\n| 21 - 25             | 36.6 |\n| 26 - 30             | 36.1 |\n| 31 - 4 February     | 37.8 |\n| 5 - 9               | 58.1 |\n| 10 - 14             | 37.6 |\n| 15 - 19             | 39.2 |\n| 20 - 24             | 42.4 |\n| 25 - 1 March        | 42.0 |\n\n| From 2 - 6 March    | 41.9 |\n|---------------------|------|\n| 7 - 11              | 48.6 |\n| 12 - 16             | 46.3 |\n| 17 - 21             | 47.8 |\n| 22 - 26             | 49.4 |\n| 27 - 31             | 51.2 |\n| 1 - 5 April         | 54.1 |\n| 6 - 10              | 55.0 |\n| 11 - 15             | 54.0 |\n| 16 - 20             | 56.6 |\n| 21 - 25             | 60.4 |\n| 26 - 30             | 62.9 |\nTo give a fair idea of the variations of temperature at Shanghai, I subjoin the means of the maxima and minima for the same 8 years:\n\n| Month     | Minima | Maxima |\n|-----------|--------|--------|\n| January   | 17.\u00b0 8 | 57.\u00b0 2 |\n| February  | 24. 3  | 61. 0  |\n| March     | 30. 2  | 75. 9  |\n| April     | 36. 7  | 84. 2  |\n| May       | 46. 9  | 89. 2  |\n| June      | 57. 7  | 92. 8  |\n| July      | 67. 8  | 97. 2  |\n| August    | 65. 3  | 95. 5  |\n| September | 55. 8  | 90. 7  |\n| October   | 40. 1  | 82. 6  |\n| November  | 28. 9  | 72. 7  |\n| December  | 21. 2  | 65. 8  |\n\nMean of the absolute minima: 16.\u00b0 5  \nMean of the absolute maxima: 97. 7\n\nAbsolute minimum: 12.\u00b0 2 January 1876  \nAbsolute maximum: 102.\u00b0 6 July 1875\nIn this period of 8 years (1873-1880) there were on an average 14 days, each year, whose mean temperature was lower than freezing point, or $32^\\circ$ Fahr. ($0^\\circ$ centigrade). In 1878, from the 3rd to the 22nd of January, there were 17 days on which the temperature kept under $32^\\circ$. For the sake of comparison, let us mention that in Paris, from 1820 to 1872, there were no more than 21 days on which the temperature kept below $32^\\circ$, the annual average being only 0.4 day.\n\n**Mean temperature of a few towns as a term for comparison:**\n\n| Year | Winter (D.J.F.) | Summer (J.J.A.) |\n|------|-----------------|----------------|\n| Shanghai | $59^\\circ$ 2 | $39^\\circ$ 1 | $78^\\circ$ 2 |\n| London   | $49^\\circ$ 6 | $39^\\circ$ 2 | $61^\\circ$ 0 |\n| Paris    | $51^\\circ$ 3 | $37^\\circ$ 9 | $64^\\circ$ 9 |\n| Peking   | $53^\\circ$ 2 | $27^\\circ$ 0 | $77^\\circ$ 0 |\n| New York | $53^\\circ$ 8 | $29^\\circ$ 8 | $79^\\circ$ 2 |\n| Madrid   | $57^\\circ$ 7 | $42^\\circ$ 1 | $74^\\circ$ 1 |\n| Rome     | $59^\\circ$ 7 | $46^\\circ$ 6 | $73^\\circ$ 2 |\n| Hongkong | $72^\\circ$ 5 | $60^\\circ$ 1 | $82^\\circ$ 3 |\n\nWe will see, when treating of moisture, how such variations of temperature can influence public health. For the manner in which the human body is affected is quite different with dry or moist air, whether warm or cold; and on such actions the salubrity of a country depends for a great part, together with the advantages or inconveniences it may offer with regard to public and private hygiene.\n\nThe variation of the temperature of the air in the course of a day is mostly dependent upon the relative length of days and nights and the clearness of the atmosphere, especially at night. The following table shows this variation at Shanghai for the four seasons of the year: it will be seen that the daily range is not invariable, being smallest in summer and greatest in spring. The greater length of days and the less obliquity of the sun\u2019s rays, in summer, are amply compensated by the mantle of vapour in the air which covers the country and prevents the cooling through radiation at night.\nTHE CLIMATE OF SHANGHAI\n\nDaily variation of temperature for the four seasons at Shanghai (5 years, 1876-1880):\n\n| Hours | Winter | Spring | Summer | Autumn | Year |\n|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|------|\n| 1 a.m.| 36\u00b0 0  | 52\u00b0 4  | 73\u00b0 6  | 58\u00b0 5  | 55\u00b0 1 |\n| 4     | 35\u00b0 2  | 51\u00b0 2  | 72\u00b0 9  | 57\u00b0 7  | 54\u00b0 3 |\n| 7     | 34\u00b0 7  | 53\u00b0 4  | 75\u00b0 9  | 59\u00b0 2  | 55\u00b0 8 |\n| 10    | 41\u00b0 2  | 60\u00b0 4  | 81\u00b0 7  | 67\u00b0 8  | 61\u00b0 8 |\n| 1 p.m.| 44\u00b0 2  | 63\u00b0 3  | 83\u00b0 7  | 69\u00b0 6  | 65\u00b0 2 |\n| 4     | 48\u00b0 1  | 62\u00b0 0  | 82\u00b0 0  | 67\u00b0 7  | 63\u00b0 7 |\n| 7     | 38\u00b0 7  | 56\u00b0 4  | 77\u00b0 0  | 61\u00b0 7  | 58\u00b0 5 |\n| 10    | 36\u00b0 9  | 53\u00b0 9  | 74\u00b0 7  | 59\u00b0 7  | 56\u00b0 3 |\n\nII.\u2014SOLAR RADIATION.\n\nThough light and heat are intimately connected as radiated by the Sun, yet the causes of diminution for each are not the same. The interposition of a cloud between the Sun and the soil suffices to extinguish a great part of the solar light without materially diminishing the amount of heat absorbed by the air in a short interval. However exceptional a year may be in regard to variations of temperature, never will January or February be found warmer than July or August; but the amount of light received by the surface of the soil can easily be greater in Winter than in Summer. Let the Winter be very cold and dry with a very clear sky and the Summer be warm and wet with a great deal of rain and clouds, and there will be a similar contrast in the general lighting of the air. Thus, in July 1880, we did not receive, at Zi-ka-wei, more than .33 of the light which the Sun can send us under the most favourable conditions, whilst in January 1881, we were exceptionally favoured and received .49 of that light. Thus again, January and July 1880 both received the same proportion of light.\n\nNow it is well known that every living being requires, not only the Sun's heat, but also and almost in the same degree his light. Valuable information about the Climate of a place may thus be supplied by Actinometry, or that department of Meteorology which deals with solar radiation comprising the heat and light available at the surface of the soil.\nHerewith are the results of the last 6 years, calculated from only the three principal observations of 10h. a.m., 1h. p.m. and 4h. p.m.\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | March | April | May  | June | July | August | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|-------|-------|------|------|------|--------|-------|------|------|------|------|\n|      |      |       |       |      |      |      |        |       |      |      |      |      |\n\nThese results, which I have purposely given in full, may be greatly useful to Shanghai physicians if compared with the sanitary state of the Settlements. For comparison's sake, I may add that, at Paris, the mean proportion of light for the period 1872-1878, observed in the same manner as at Zi-ka-wei, was .28 in December (minimum) and .66 in July (maximum), the annual mean being under .49. It must be remarked however that in the calculations the observations of 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. were taken into account.\n\nIII.\u2014MOISTURE.\n\nThe determination of this element is of great importance. Moisture has been considered by climatologists as one of the physical properties of the air most injurious to human life. A moist atmosphere checks the spontaneous evaporation of the surface of the skin and exercises a debilitating action on all organic functions; a dry air, on the contrary, favours evaporation; it is vivifying and bracing. Whoever has resided at Shanghai for a few years knows by experience how in Summer the strongest man feels oppressed and sluggish, whilst in Winter he has a sense of exalted vitality and excessive muscular energy. It is because in the hottest months, June, July, and August, the air is loaded with moisture, whilst in the cold season, December, January, and February, it is very dry. I shall hereafter, when speaking of the winds, give the reason of this remarkable difference between Summer and Winter in this country.\n\nBut first, what is properly moisture? It is easier to feel it than to give a definition of it. One often hears of the air being more or less moist, more or less saturated with humidity: what is the precise meaning of these expressions?\n\n---\n\n8 Annuaire de l'Observatoire de Montseuris, 1878.\nPhysicists easily prove that a volume of air cannot, at a given temperature, contain more than a certain quantity of vapour: it is then said to be saturated; any water in excess of that quantity will remain in the liquid state. Thus a cubic foot of dry air, at a pressure of 30 inches and at 32\u00b0 Fahrenheit, weighs 563 grains; under these conditions it cannot take up more than 2.11 gr. of water as vapour; at 90\u00b0 it could hold 13.47 gr.\n\nKnowing the maximum weight for each temperature and degree of atmospheric pressure, and possessing instruments whose indications give the means to calculate the actual weight of vapour in a cubic foot of air, it will be easy to ascertain the exact degree of moisture of that air and consequently of the mass of air to which it belongs; for the degree of moisture is nothing else than the ratio of the actual weight of vapour contained in the air to the maximum weight it could hold at the same temperature and pressure. The instruments most in use for that purpose are the Psychrometer or better still Regnault's condensation hygrometer.\n\nThe following tables will help to form an idea of the hygrometric conditions of this place.\n\n**Weight of vapour in a cubic foot of air at Shanghai (8 years).**\n\n| January | February | March | April | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year. |\n|---------|----------|-------|-------|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|\n| 2.00    | 2.15     | 2.25  | 4.11  | 5.00 | 7.40 | 9.00 | 9.00 | 9.00  | 7.57 | 6.41 | 5.75 | 5.10 |\n\n**Degree of moisture of air for each month (8 years).**\n\n| January | February | March | April | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year. |\n|---------|----------|-------|-------|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|\n| 8       | 9        | 7     | 6     | 5   | 4    | 3    | 2    | 1     | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5     |\n\n**Degree of moisture of air at different periods of the day for the four seasons (5 years).**\n\n| Hours | Winter | Spring | Summer | Autumn | Year. |\n|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|\n| 1 a.m.| 88.7   | 89.4   | 93.6   | 91.1   | 90.7  |\n| 4     | 89.7   | 90.8   | 94.8   | 91.9   | 91.8  |\n| 7     | 90.8   | 87.6   | 89.0   | 89.9   | 88.2  |\n| 10    | 74.6   | 69.9   | 78.4   | 67.8   | 71.3  |\n| 1 p.m.| 65.8   | 63.4   | 70.6   | 60.6   | 65.1  |\n| 4     | 68.1   | 64.4   | 72.9   | 64.6   | 68.2  |\n| 7     | 81.0   | 80.5   | 86.5   | 83.4   | 82.6  |\n| 10    | 94.4   | 86.6   | 92.0   | 88.3   | 86.3  |\n| Mean  | 80.6   | 79.8   | 84.2   | 79.5   | 80.9  |\nContinents naturally supply less vapour to the atmosphere than the sea; the degree of moisture is therefore generally lower in the interior than on the coast. If then we have a coast where the wind in the course of the year blows alternately from the interior of the continent and from the open sea, the moisture will increase or diminish as the wind blows from the sea or from the land. The absolute quantity of water in the air will generally reach its maximum during the warm season, but the relative moisture will mostly depend upon the prevailing winds. At Shanghai, E. and S. E. winds from the sea are the prevailing winds during the six months of the warm season, N. E. and N. W. winds being the most common during the cold months. There is then a double reason for Summer being the moist season, as the capacity of air for vapour rapidly rises with the temperature; and the air blown from the sea is always near its point of saturation. In winter, on the contrary, the vapour in the air is far from saturating it, notwithstanding the low temperature; and the winter at Shanghai is often very dry.\n\nThe passage from one system to the other is slow as it appears from the foregoing tables, and this gradual transition is far better for the body than the rapid change that generally takes place in the interior of the continent, at Peking for instance.\n\nWe will review in a few words the advantages and drawbacks of those two mediums in which residents in this country live by turns in the course of the year.\n\n**Winter\u2014Cold and dry air:**\n\nContraction of the capillary vessels of the skin\u2014Diminution of perspiration\u2014Increase of the quantity of urine\u2014Greater consumption of oxygen\u2014Quicker breathing\u2014More regular appetite\u2014Muscular activity and strength\u2014Exuberance of animal spirits.\n\n**Summer\u2014Warm and moist air (containing, for the same volume, less oxygen):**\n\nQuick and laborious breathing: hence incomplete hematosis.\u2014The peripheral vessels receive an abundance of liquids, but capillary circulation is sluggish\u2014Moisture checks the evaporation of the perspiration\u2014Appetite blunted, digestion laberious\u2014The relaxation of tissues by warmth and moisture creates a predisposition\nto congestions\u2014Increase in the weight of the body\u2014Weakness of the muscular system.\n\nIt is evident that, were it not for the benefit of its cold and dry winter, the climate of Shanghai would be most detestable.\n\nIV.\u2014ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE.\n\nThis element is of no great importance for a station situated, as Shanghai, at the level of the sea. It would be otherwise at a great altitude, as is the case with numbers of towns in mountainous countries or on high plateaux: the conditions of life are quite different and the phenomena of organic life are intimately connected with the density and pressure of the air.\n\nI shall therefore confine myself to giving the daily variation of the barometer at Shanghai and its monthly variation, since it is the cause of the opposite regular winds (monsoons) which blow by turns through the course of the year.\n\nDaily variation of atmospheric pressure at Shanghai (1876-1880).\n\n| Time   | Pressure |\n|--------|----------|\n| 1 a.m. | 30.034   |\n| 4      | 30.017   |\n|        | 1st minimum. |\n| 7      | 30.043   |\n| 10     | 30.062   |\n|        | 1st maximum. |\n| 1 p.m. | 30.018   |\n| 4      | 30.001   |\n|        | 2nd minimum. |\n| 7      | 30.024   |\n| 10     | 30.047   |\n|        | 2nd maximum. |\n| Mean   | 30.031   |\n\nMonthly mean atmospheric pressure at Shanghai (1873-1880).\n\n| Month    | Pressure |\n|----------|----------|\n| January  | 30.388   |\n| February | 30.296   |\n| March    | 30.198   |\n| April    | 30.037   |\n| May      | 29.876   |\n| June     | 29.778   |\n| July     | 29.711   |\n| August   | 29.766   |\n| September| 29.920   |\n| October  | 30.144   |\n| November | 30.265   |\n| December | 30.315   |\n\nAnnual mean 30.058.\nMean atmospheric pressure for each period of 5 days (1873-1880).\n\n| Period       | Pressure |\n|--------------|----------|\n| from 1 to 5 Jan. | .341     |\n| \" 6 \u2014 10\"    | .391     |\n| \" 11 \u2014 15\"   | .443     |\n| \" 16 \u2014 20\"   | .414     |\n| \" 21 \u2014 25\"   | .376     |\n| \" 26 \u2014 30\"   | .379     |\n| \" 31 \u2014 4 Feb.\" | .323    |\n| \" 5 \u2014 9\"     | .321     |\n| \" 10 \u2014 14\"   | .261     |\n| \" 15 \u2014 19\"   | .330     |\n| \" 20 \u2014 24\"   | .241     |\n| \" 25 \u2014 1 March\" | .275   |\n| \" 2 \u2014 6\"     | .278     |\n| \" 7 \u2014 11\"    | .231     |\n| \" 12 \u2014 16\"   | .201     |\n| \" 17 \u2014 21\"   | .192     |\n| \" 22 \u2014 26\"   | .162     |\n| \" 27 \u2014 31\"   | .119     |\n| \" 1 \u2014 5 April\" | .116    |\n| \" 6 \u2014 10\"    | .043     |\n| \" 11 \u2014 15\"   | .110     |\n| \" 16 \u2014 20\"   | .084     |\n| \" 21 \u2014 25\"   | .947     |\n| \" 26 \u2014 30\"   | .956     |\n| \" 1 \u2014 5 May\"  | .974     |\n| \" 6 \u2014 10\"    | .898     |\n| \" 11 \u2014 15\"   | .888     |\n| \" 16 \u2014 20\"   | .884     |\n| \" 21 \u2014 25\"   | .844     |\n| \" 26 \u2014 30\"   | .792     |\n| \" 31 \u2014 4 June\" | .858    |\n| \" 5 \u2014 9\"     | .839     |\n| \" 10 \u2014 14\"   | .771     |\n| \" 15 \u2014 19\"   | .736     |\n| \" 20 \u2014 24\"   | .758     |\n| \" 25 \u2014 29\"   | .779     |\n\n| Period       | Pressure |\n|--------------|----------|\n| from 80 to 4 July | .742    |\n| \" 5 \u2014 9\"     | .687     |\n| \" 10 \u2014 14\"   | .713     |\n| \" 15 \u2014 19\"   | .709     |\n| \" 20 \u2014 24\"   | .717     |\n| \" 25 \u2014 29\"   | .735     |\n| \" 30 \u2014 3 Aug.\" | .720    |\n| \" 4 \u2014 8\"     | .728     |\n| \" 9 \u2014 13\"    | .709     |\n| \" 14 \u2014 18\"   | .755     |\n| \" 19 \u2014 23\"   | .800     |\n| \" 24 \u2014 28\"   | .815     |\n| \" 29 \u2014 2 Sept.\" | .901   |\n| \" 3 \u2014 7\"     | .863     |\n| \" 8 \u2014 12\"    | .866     |\n| \" 13 \u2014 17\"   | .953     |\n| \" 18 \u2014 22\"   | .917     |\n| \" 23 \u2014 27\"   | .90 .001 |\n| \" 28 \u2014 2 Oct.\" | .996    |\n| \" 3 \u2014 7\"     | .108     |\n| \" 8 \u2014 12\"    | .145     |\n| \" 13 \u2014 17\"   | .179     |\n| \" 18 \u2014 22\"   | .103     |\n| \" 23 \u2014 27\"   | .171     |\n| \" 28 \u2014 1 Nov.\" | .226    |\n| \" 2 \u2014 6\"     | .216     |\n| \" 7 \u2014 11\"    | .260     |\n| \" 12 \u2014 16\"   | .311     |\n| \" 17 \u2014 21\"   | .263     |\n| \" 22 \u2014 26\"   | .270     |\n| \" 27 \u2014 1 Dec.\" | .275    |\n| \" 2 \u2014 6\"     | .293     |\n| \" 7 \u2014 11\"    | .307     |\n| \" 12 \u2014 16\"   | .286     |\n| \" 17 \u2014 21\"   | .320     |\n| \" 22 \u2014 26\"   | .348     |\n| \" 27 \u2014 31\"   | .344     |\n\nThe two last tables show that atmospheric pressure, at Shanghai, undergoes a perfectly perceptible oscillation during the\ncourse of the year; at its maximum in January (the 13th: 30.\u00b0N 476), it sinks gradually till July (the 6th: 20.\u00b0N 674) to rise again. This variation is not peculiar to our station; it is observed all over Asia: its cause and consequences we must briefly explain.\n\nV.\u2014WINDS\u2014MONSOONS.\n\nOn the whole Southern and Eastern slope of Asia we see a mutual reaction of continental and oceanic influences, the great Monsoons. In our Winter the continental regions of Asia are cooler than the surrounding seas and pressure is higher; the air consequently, actuated by gravity, flows from the continent towards the ocean: hence we have steady Northerly (N. E., N. and N. W.) winds which blow through the Winter and are naturally cold and dry. This is the Winter Monsoon and the dry Season on the Eastern coast of China. In our Summer, pressure is very low over a great part of the Asiatic continent, owing to the heat and the ascending current produced by it: therefore the air of the ocean will flow towards Asia. Hence the winds from E., S. E. and S. which prevail at Shanghai and bring the well-known excess of moisture. This is the Summer Monsoon and the wet Season.\n\nHerewith we give the mean direction of the wind at Shanghai, determined from hourly observations made during eight years at Zi-ka-wei by means of self-registering anemometers giving each moment the direction and velocity of the wind.\n\nMean direction of the wind at Shanghai (1873-1880) and mean velocity per hour (1875-1880).\n\n| Month | Direction | Speed |\n|-------|-----------|-------|\n| Jan.  | N. 4\u00b0 W.  | 8.2 miles |\n| Feb.  | N. 11 E.  | 8.7 \"    |\n| March | N. 51 E.  | 8.8 \"    |\n| April | S. 79 E.  | 8.8 \"    |\n| May   | S. 54 E.  | 9.0 \"    |\n| June  | S. 66 E.  | 8.5 \"    |\n| July  | S. 41\u00b0 E. | 8.8 miles |\n| Aug.  | S. 70 E.  | 7.2 \"    |\n| Sept. | N. 54 E.  | 6.4 \"    |\n| Oct.  | N. 33 E.  | 6.1 \"    |\n| Nov.  | N. 6 W.   | 6.4 \"    |\n| Dec.  | N. 11 W.  | 8.1 \"    |\n\nAnnual Mean: N. 62\u00b0 E.\u20147.9 miles.\nThus the wind which blows from N. in January, veers to N. E. between February and March, to E., between March and April, to S. E. in May; it turns a little to E. again in June, whilst July enjoys the most Southerly wind. From that month to the end of the year it turns to E. and N., getting in December as far as N. 11\u00b0 W. The oscillation is then perfectly definite. The alternation of the two Monsoons is equally a constant fact not subject to any exception.\n\nSqualls or gales, though not violent, are frequent enough at Shanghai, as this port is about equally distant from the most common track of two kinds of storms that come now and then to break the sameness of the settled Monsoons. In Winter, there are frequent atmospheric depressions issuing from Central Asia; they run from West to East, crossing with great velocity Siberia, Mongolia and Japan; they rush towards the area of minimum pressure that exists in the middle of the North-Pacific Ocean. In Summer, there are Typhoons in the South, between 15\u00b0 and 25\u00b0 latitude North, following the opposite direction, from East to West, and proceeding from the Equatorial Pacific towards the Philippines and Southern China or Tonquin; sometimes, chiefly in July and August, they take a run northward, approach Shanghai and carry havoc over Japan.\n\nDuring the passage of those Northerly storms that usually rage with violence along their path, the winds at Shanghai are convergent to the centre of the depression: they consequently begin by blowing feebly from E. or E. S. E., then they turn slowly as the depression approaches, as shown by the progressive sinking of the barometer. While the storm is raging North of Shanghai, the barometer is at its lowest point; the wind comes from S. or S. W., bringing a high temperature and a great amount of moisture; when at last the depression moves, there is generally a strong gale from N. W. which, in Winter, brings very cold weather.\n\nThe Typhoons are much smaller in diameter than the Northern atmospheric depressions, and whenever they keep in Southern regions, they are not perceived at Shanghai except by a slight fall of the barometer, the winds being E. or N. E.\nThese two kinds of storms, with regard to the amount of rain they bring on, both partake of the nature of the seasons during which they usually form: the Winter depressions, coming from the interior of the continent with the great dry air current that issues from it, raise enormous masses of dust which they carry far and wide, increasing the barrenness of the countries they pass over. The Typhoons, on the contrary, originating in the warm and moist maritime regions of the Equator, are invariably characterized by diluvial rains.\n\nVI.\u2014RAIN.\n\nThis peculiar system of rain in the Monsoon regions appears clearly from the following tables calculated from the observations taken at Zi-ka-wei.\n\nFrequency and amount of rain fallen at Shanghai (1873-1880).\n\n| Month   | days. inches |\n|---------|--------------|\n| January | 9.4 .2.269   |\n| February| 11.7 2.887   |\n| March   | 12.0 2.871   |\n| April   | 12.5 3.888   |\n| May     | 11.1 2.871   |\n| June    | 13.0 7.857   |\n| July    | 11.2 3.560   |\n| August  | 10.5 4.665   |\n| September| 10.9 5.714 |\n| October | 8.7 2.840   |\n| November| 6.9 1.902   |\n| December| 6.1 1.390   |\n\nAnnual Sum: 124 days. 42.464 inches.\n\nOf these 124 rainy days we have:\n\nin Winter 54.8 days giving 14.219\"m of water.\nin Summer 69.2 ,, ,, 28.245 ,,,\n\nThe heaviest shower was that of October 24th 1875, during which there fell 7.088\"m of water in 3\u00bd hours, equal to 2.024\"m per hour.\n\nSnow is frequent in Winter, particularly in January, the coldest but not the driest month of the year.\n\nVII.\u2014NEBULOSITY, OR CLOUDS.\n\nThe state of the sky, its clearness or nebulosity, is evidently closely connected with the moisture of the air. Yet, with the exception of November and December, usually the finest months\nof the year, the mean co-efficient of nebulosity varies little from one season to another: the reason is that the upper regions of the atmosphere are swept by a huge current which for 9 or 10 months always runs from West to East, carrying along clouds (cirri) that have nothing to do with the moisture or dryness of the lower strata of air. Those clouds (alto-cumuli, cirri, cirro-strati), of a thousand shapes and varieties, are always of a graceful aspect; they may truly be said to make up two-thirds of the nebulosity of our sky.\n\nThese indications with regard to the meteorological conditions of the Climate of Shanghai, though brief, are yet sufficient to enable physicians to form an opinion upon the salubrity of the port. To complete the study of this climate, the water and soil should be inquired into, and the knowledge thus acquired would throw light on the causes of the prevailing diseases, and would also explain how residence in Shanghai might be beneficial to some patients. I must however leave this to others more versed in these questions.\nMiscellaneous.\n\nList of Ferns found in the Valley of the River Min, Foochow.*\n\nADIANIUM cuneatum.

Stripling, Esq.,\n\nVice-Presidents.\nCouncillors.\n\nSix General Meetings of the Society were held during the year.\n\nOwing to the departure of Mr. G. H. J. Kleinw\u00e4chter from Shanghai the post of Treasurer became vacant and Mr. T. S.\nSouthev at the request of the Council consented to act. Mr. T. W. Kingsmill on his return from Europe being unable to undertake the duties of Curator, Mr. D. C. Jansen kindly consented to remain in office.\n\nThe following papers were read at the Meetings of the Society:\n\n1.\u201416th March, \"Fresh Water in the Sand Banks of the Formosa Channel.\" By F. W. Schulze, Esq.\n\n2.\u2014\"Notes of a Trip to the Island of Saghalin.\" By Geo. C. Anderson, Esq.\n\n3.\u201426th April, \"On the Rapids of the Upper Yangtsze.\" By E. H. Parker, Esq., of H. B.

M.'s Consular Service.\n\n9.\u201415th December, \"The Minor Currency of Annam.\" By E. Toda, Esq., Consul for Spain.\n\nThe Society was represented at the Third International Geographical Congress at Venice, in September, 1881, by Lieut. G. Kreitner; who has furnished a valuable and interesting report on the work of the Congress referring to Central and Eastern Asia.\n\nTwo Corresponding Members, Dr. H. Fritsche of Peking and Lieut. G. Kreitner of the I. R. Austrian Army, and fifteen Ordinary Members were elected during the year.\nThree Ordinary Members resigned. There were on the list of the Society on the 31st December, 1881, fourteen Honorary, twenty-six Corresponding, and one hundred and twenty-three Ordinary Members.\n\nThe Society has to deplore the death of one Honorary Member, Mr. A. F. Marques Pereira, who died at Bombay on September 11th, 1881.*\n\nThe Meetings have continued to be fairly well attended, and the Public generally taken a greater interest in the work of the Society. Probably from want of knowledge of the facilities now afforded to readers the Library of the Society is not so largely availed of as might be expected. It is now placed in communication with the Shanghai Library, and permission to make use of it can be obtained on application to the Librarian of that institution.\n\nThe first part of the Society's Journal for 1881 was issued in March, 1882.\n\nSome of the older volumes of the Society's Proceedings being out of print the Council propose to issue a new edition, should a sufficient number of subscribers to justify the venture be forthcoming. Some of these volumes at present command a high price.\n\nThe usual reports of the Treasurer, Librarian, and Curator of the Museum are appended.\n\n* Mr. A. F. Marques Pereira had been an Honorary Member of our Society since 1865. He was born at Lisbon, and entered, while young, the Consular Service of his country. After having received his preliminary training in Portugal, he was sent out to China, and ultimately served for eight or nine years at Bangkok, whence, early in the past year, he was transferred as Consul-General to Bombay. He was a man of considerable literary attainments and the author of several works on the history of the Portuguese Colony at Macao and the relations of the Portuguese with China since their arrival in the 16th century. During his residence in the East he was always a true and earnest friend to our Society, taking great interest in Oriental matters, and more particularly in Numismatics. While in Bangkok, he made a fine collection of Siamese coins, a portion of which was presented to the King of Portugal; and his pamphlet: *Moedas de Siam. Lisboa: 1879*, contains much valuable information on the little-known subject of Siamese Coinage. Mr. Marques Pereira was an Honorary Member of several learned Societies of Europe and Asia.\nLIST OF MEMBERS.\n\nAPRIL, 1882.\n\nHONORARY.\n\nHis Majesty LEOPOLD II., King of the Belgians.\n\nAlcock, Sir Rutherford, K.C.B., London.\nHart, Robert, Esq., C.M.G., Peking.\nLegge, Rev.

Journal.\nCurator's Report.\n\nTo the President, Council, and Members of the North-China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nThe additions to our Museum during the past year are enumerated in the annexed list.\n\nThe falling off in the number of specimens presented, as compared with the previous year, must not be attributed to any decrease of interest in the institution on the part of its hitherto liberal supporters. Formerly contributions consisted mostly of the fauna of this neighbourhood, or such as were brought here from the coast ports, requiring no further trouble from the person presenting them than sending to the curator or taxidermist to mount and place on the shelves of the Museum; but now that it is generally known that such specimens are, to a large extent, well represented in our collection, and as few persons possess sufficient knowledge of taxidermy, or care to perform the tedious labour of preparing the specimens themselves, contributions come in much slower than when they were to be obtained with so little trouble.\n\nOf the 800 species of birds found in China our Museum contains but 313 specimens, 214 of which belong to this province or are common throughout China; and to give an idea how slowly this number has been increased, it may be mentioned that not more than twenty species have been added during the last four years.\n\nFrom this it will be seen that we can no longer rely on voluntary contributions to increase our collections. If we wish to obtain specimens of the natural history of the southern, interior, or\nmore remote localities we must either purchase where best we can, or employ some one to collect for us. In the meantime however let us hope that former contributors and others will not withhold their contributions under the mistaken impression that they will not be acceptable.\n\nWe want everything\u2014mammals, birds, reptiles, fishes, in fact every description of the Natural History of this country, and more especially those descriptions most commonly met with; as a good collection of these once made would help to fill our shelves and present such an interesting exhibit that the rarer or more expensive kinds would soon follow.\n\nIn exchange for a number of duplicate specimens of birds, Dr. Dale, U.S.N.\u2014collecting for the National Museum, Washington\u2014sent us 66 kinds of fishes found in the Hongkong waters; to these have been added, mostly by purchase, some 40 or 50 more inhabiting the waters about Shanghai and the Chusan Archipelago. Duplicates of this small collection are being packed for transhipment to England to have them identified and classed, and thus form a nucleus which no doubt will soon develop into a valuable, and it is to be hoped, comprehensive collection of the fishes inhabiting the waters of China,\u2014a section of ichthyology presenting a most interesting field of research, as it has been hitherto but little studied.\n\nAs making a collection of fishes calls forth no special knowledge of taxidermy and requires but little labour beyond gathering the specimens, small tanks are being constructed to be filled with suitable preserving liquid and supplied to persons at the coast and riverine ports with the view of obtaining specimens of the fishes peculiar to such places.\n\nA list of the articles in the Museum has been made, and will be sent in for publication as soon as the scientific names of the fishes and other specimens sent home for identification arrive.\n\nA communication from Dr. Guppy, R.N., adds the following\ncorrections and additions to his valuable contributions of geological specimens as given in the Curator's report of last year.\n\nD.

During the year no less than 363 volumes have been entered in the Register of Accessions, not including Chinese works and publications on Natural History, a Catalogue of which is in preparation.\n\nAs the purchasing power of the Library is necessarily limited, it has been the chief aim of the Librarian to extend the relations of exchange with kindred Societies and Public Departments, and he is glad to announce that his applications in this direction have been very liberally responded to. The appended list shows the names of 66 Societies, Public Institutions, etc., which now regularly forward their publications to the Library, and a number of other Societies have since been addressed with a view to obtaining their transactions.\n\nThe Library is especially indebted for valuable support to the Superintendent of the Geological Survey of India, to the Director of the Imperial Botanical Garden at St. Petersburg, and to the Imperial Academy of Sciences at Vienna, the number of volumes presented by these three Institutions alone amounting to 162. Among the more important accessions may also be mentioned a complete set of the Journal of the Bombay Asiatic Society, the numerous publications of the Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen, and the Bulletin and Memoirs of the Zi-ka-wei Observatory.\n\nOn the other hand, it is a matter of regret that the Library receives but scanty support from authors and private indivi-\nduals in the East and elsewhere. Although our list of members includes not a few whose names are familiar to readers of Tr\u00fcbner's Literary Record, their publications will in most cases be looked for in vain on the shelves of the only special Library at Shanghai. Of individual contributors Dr. Legge, M. C. Imbault-Huart, and Mr. K. I. Streich, who presented a Chinese mapemonde, published in 1674 by Father Verbiest, deserve especial thanks for their donations.\n\nBy kind permission of the Shanghai Library arrangements have been made with the London Agent of that Institution, the latter undertaking to forward all publications addressed to the Society with the monthly parcels sent out to the Shanghai Library. The various transactions of Learned Societies are thus received with as little delay as possible, an arrangement which cannot fail to enhance the value of the Library as a repository of periodical scientific literature.\n\nThe number of readers has slightly increased since the circulation of the books has been placed under the efficient control of the Committee of the Shanghai Library, but it can hardly be said that the capabilities of the Library are utilised in proportion to its development. It is true that the collection will be found deficient in works of light literature, but considering the number of residents who are led by profession, if not by predilection, to take a more than cursory interest in the land they live in, it seems strange that no greater demands are made upon the splendid resources of the Library.\n\nIn conclusion I have to thank the Librarians of the Shanghai Library, Mr. and Mrs. Gale, for the able assistance they have given me throughout the year.\n\nShanghai, March, 1882.\n\nM.
