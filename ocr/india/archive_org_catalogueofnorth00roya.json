C. B. Royal Asiatic Society was prepared by Mr. Henri Cordier, and in the preface he referred to Mr. Wylie's library of 718 volumes and pamphlets which, added to the other volumes already in the possession of the Society, formed a collection of standard works on the East numbering about 1,300 volumes.\n\nSince, in 1894, Mr. Joseph Haas completed the third edition of the library catalogue there has been but one issue of a list of additions thereto, namely that compiled in 1899, by Herr Emil Fischer and published in Vol. XXX of the Journal. Members of the Society and the reading public generally, have, therefore, since then, been in ignorance of much that the library contains.\n\nIn 1907 after careful deliberation, the Council decided that a new catalogue be prepared\u2014that all the books in the library, instead of being kept, as heretofore apart as a \"Museum Section,\" China Section, etc. should be included in the same Catalogue, and finally, that one of the most modern systems of classification should be adopted.\n\nUpon the strong recommendation of Mr. Bolton of the Athen\u00e6um, Boston, U.S.A., who rendered invaluable aid, it was decided to make a \"dictionary catalogue\" on cards, classifying according to the Dewey Decimal Classification and Index, used in conjunction with the Cutter Author Numbers. It may be well to give in the words of the author a short explanation of this classification.\n\n\"The field of knowledge is divided into nine main classes, and these are numbered by the digits 1 to 9\u2014Encyclopaedias, etc., so general in character as to belong to no one of these classes are marked nought and form a tenth class. Each class is similarly separated into 9 divisions, divisions are similarly divided into 9 sections, and the process is repeated as often as is necessary. The books on the shelves are arranged in simple numerical order, and since each subject has a definite number it follows that all books on any subject must stand together.\"\n\nThe Cutter Numbers for their part provide each book with a Shelf Number in addition to its Class Number.\n### Main Divisions of Classification\n\n#### 000 General Works\n\n| Code | Description                      |\n|------|----------------------------------|\n| 010  | Bibliography                     |\n| 020  | Library Economy                  |\n| 030  | General Cyclopedias              |\n| 040  | General Collections              |\n| 050  | General Periodicals              |\n| 060  | General Societies                |\n| 070  | Newspapers                       |\n| 080  | Special Libraries.

Therein works appear, not only under their author's name, their title, but also under the subject, or subjects, to which they refer. For instance, M. Cordier's Edition of Yule's Marco Polo will be found under Cordier, Yule, Polo, Travel, Asia (travels in). The student, desirous of knowing what books on any particular subject the library can place at his disposal has but to turn that subject up. \"Inscriptions\" \"Birds\" \"Language\" \"Geology\" \"History\" etc., as the case may be. Under each heading he will find a list of the works thereon.\n\nIn 1908 this catalogue was completed and the books were re-shelved. During this work the old catalogue was in continual use and but few changes were found necessary, in the actual classification,\u2014while the ample and studious notes, of my predecessors, were carefully preserved. Copies of the old catalogue being dissected and the note on each work, being pasted on to the title and reference cards of the new Catalogue.\n\nWhile the advantages of this card system, its possibility of infinite expansion, its comprehensiveness, etc., are obvious, the disadvantages are no less so. To those members of the Society who do not live in Shanghai the complete contents of the library were as unknown as ever, and even for those on the spot, a journey to the library itself, was necessary, to discover these same contents.\nIt was therefore decided to print, and issue in book form, a classified catalogue arranged according to subjects. This of necessity, has been done in a manner as abbreviated as possible. Each work is mentioned, it is true, but only once, and then in the class to which it belongs. Its title is where possible condensed\u2014its author is shorn of all titles and degrees\u2014in fact the printed catalogue is but a skeleton of the card catalogue which may be consulted in the library itself.\n\nSuch as it is however it will serve to bring to the notice of all our friends not only what the library contains, but what it lacks. Many of the remarks of M. Cordier and M. Haas apply to-day as they did 15 years ago; but judging by the generous and immediate response that has met all my requests for assistance during this period of re-organization, I feel that it is only through forgetfulness that the library is ever neglected\u2014and can but hope that this booklet may serve as a silent reminder, to those who have aught to give, that an honoured place for the fruit of their labours is prepared on the library shelves of the N.C.B.R.A.S.\n\nFlorence Wheelock Ayscough.\nHon. Librarian.\n\nJuly 24th, 1909.\nPREFACE TO FIFTH EDITION.\n\nSince the last edition of the Catalogue was printed in 1909 the growth of the library has been slow but steady, and the number of people using it not only in Shanghai but also in the interior of China have greatly increased.\n\nIt still suffers from the forgetfulness,\u2014not the willing neglect\u2014of authors. Refusals to requests for books are rare, but unfortunately unsolicited presentations are not as numerous as might be wished.\n\nMay the hope be treasured that in the preface to the sixth edition no such remark need be made.\n\nFlorence Wheelock Ayscough.\n\nMarch, 1921.\nLIBRARY RULES\n\nI.\u2014The Library is open daily.\n\nII.\u2014The circulation of the books is under the control of the Council of the Society.\n\nIII.\u2014Members of the Society not resident in Shanghai may have books sent to their address by making arrangements for delivery satisfactory to the Hon.
