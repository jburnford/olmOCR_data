Burkill.\n\nBy the kindness of Dr. F. W. Foxworthy, I have been able to examine seedlings of *Balanocarpus maximus, King*. He was so good as to get the fruits for me in the Bikam forest reserve, Lower Perak, on February 1st, 1919, from an old tree which, alone among the trees there, was bearing. The seedlings were raised in the Botanic Gardens, Singapore.\n\nIn the germination of *Balanocarpus maximus* the fruit-wall splits into three equal parts, one of which carries the placenta attached to it medially. The expanding cotyledons force the segments apart, and immediately increase their gaping if the wall be removed. The equality of these three segments of the fruit-wall suggests *Dryobalanops*.\n\nThe radicle may evert itself from the fruit through the crack which is opposite the placenta: in figure 1 it is shewn emerging from it.\n\n![Figure 1. A germinating fruit of *Balanocarpus maximus*, \u00bd nat. size.]\n\nThe embryo, removed from the fruit-wall and seed-coats, is drawn in figures 2 and 3. It is shown in them how the cotyledons are placed so that the outer occupies the apex of the ovary-cavity, and the placentar the base. If these two figures be compared with figures of other species of the Dipterocarpaceae, it will be realised that the condition is an extreme one,\u2014a specialisation not attained in any other of the species so far brought under study: and the thought occurs that if, the parental stock of the order possessed an embryo with equal and parallel cotyledons, then this species is most remote from the stock, far more remote than either *Balanocarpus penangianus*, King, or *Balanocarpus Curtisi*, King, which have been illustrated on pages\u2014and\u2014of this Journal, 1919, No. 81.\nFigure 2. The embryo of *Balanocarpus maximus* seen from the outer side; and figure 3 from the placentar side, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) nat. size.\n\nThe surface of the cotyledons is very faintly lined by pressing upon obscure ridges on the inner surface of the ovary wall. The cotyledons are reddish: they contain starch with some oil.\n\nWhen the cotyledons have expanded, they are as in figures 4 and 5. The outer cotyledon now distinctly suggests the outer cotyledon of *Anisoptera costata*, Korth., (see in this Journal, 1917, p. 44); but the placentar cotyledon is quite different.\n\nFigure 4. The outer cotyledon of *Balanocarpus maximus* from outside (above) and from inside (below), \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) nat. size.\n\nFigure 5. The Placentar cotyledon of *Balanocarpus maximus* from the side towards the outer cotyledon (above) and from the other side (below).\n\nThe seedling produces two pairs of leaves above the cotyledons, which almost make a whorl. After that alternate leaves are produced.\n\nThe fruit of *Balanocarpus maximus* is not wind distributed having no wings; but it floats, though the germinating embryo sinks. It may be that the fruits gets distributed by being washed short distances along the ground when rain is heavy.\nThe Early Muhammadan Missionaries.\n\nBy R. O. Winstedt.\n\nSince I wrote my paper on the \"Advent of Muhammadanism in the Malay Peninsula and Archipelago\" in Journal 77, I have come across a lecture by that greatest of authorities on things Muhammadan, Dr. Snouck Hurgronje, entitled Arabie en Oost-Indie (Leyden). From this lecture it is quite clear that while a few stray Arabs visited the Malay world (\"Merveilles de l'Inde,\" Leyden, 1883\u201486, pages 255-264), the bulk of Muhammadan missionaries came from India, and were natives of Gujerat and Malabar.\n\nThe points may be briefly summarized:\u2014I add local corroborative evidence.\n\n(1) The 3 Pasai grave-stones of 1407, 1408, and 1428 A.D. are of Cambay workmanship (J. P. Moquette's paper in Tijd. Bat. Gen. LIX, 1912, pages 208 and 536). So is the Grisek tomb. And two points unknown to Dr. Hurgronje: the Bruas tomb, in Perak, like the Pasai and Grisek tombs is of Indian type; and the Pengkalan Kempas tomb of 1467 A.D. has an inscription in some undeciphered Indian alphabet as well as an inscription in Malay:\u2014here I must correct a suggestion in my previous paper; geology shows that the 'Sword' is of local stone.\n\n(2) The 1407 Pasai tomb is that of Abdullah ibn Muhammad ibn Abdu'l-Kadir ibn Abdu'l-Aziz ibn al-Mansur Abu Ja'far al-Abbas al-Muntasir. Abdullah was thus of the house of Abbas, which provided Baghdad with its Khalifs from the time of the Prophet till it was destroyed by the Turks in 1258 and the last of the Abbaside Khalifs, al-Musta'sim, was killed. Al-Musta'sim had succeeded in the Khalifate al-Muntasir, who is mentioned on this tomb: and the father of Abdullah whose tomb it is was closely related to him. Now Muhammad, the father of Abdullah, emigrated from Baghdad to India and lived in Delhi; and it must have been from Delhi that his son, the Pasai saint, went to Sumatra. So, too, probably the missionaries to Java and Bruas and the saint buried at Pengkalan Kempas came from India.\n\n(3) The list of missionaries given in the Bustanu's-Salatin (Neumann's Ht. Aceh) contains mostly Indians, with some Syrians and Egyptians.\n\n(4) Evidently the Arabs and Malays knew little of one another. Between 1600-1650 A.D. the Rajas of Banten and Mata-ram sent envoys to the Sharif of Mecca asking him to bestow on them Sultanates, although for centuries then Mecca had been under the Usmanli Sultans of Istambul! In 1688 envoys from\nthe Sharif of Mecca went to India to remind the Great Mogul of tithes due to the Holy City: and they learnt for the first time from Indian friends that Acheen was a Muhammadan kingdom and it was likely they could collect funds in Sumatra! [One may add as another instance of Malay ignorance lines like S\u00e9rban Kashmiri warna hijau, Buatan Arab di-n\u00e9g\u00e9ri Makkah.]\n\n(5) The Malay alphabet is not Arabic but Perso-Hindustani.\n\n(6) Many early books were translated from the Persian or oftener from Indian versions of Persian originals. [E.g. the Ht. Iskandar Dzu'l-Karnain, the Bustanu's-Salatin, the Taju's-Salatin, Ht. Muhammad Hanafiah, Ht. Amir Hamza, the Ht. Bayan Budiman. Shaikh Nuruddin of Gujerat translated the first two (Journal 77, page 174 and Bustanu's-Salatin Vol. II, page 26 Singapore 1900); and Brandes and van Ronkel have discussed the origin of the two last. But there is much more to be done in this line of research. There is no evidence of direct Persian influence on the Malays: it came through Indian channels.]\n\n(7) Malay religious literature, discussed in Vol. II of Snouck Hurgronje's 'The Achinese,' is often repulsive to Arab ideas, and is infected with that popular pantheism which India borrowed from Persia. [The charms collected by Skeat in his \"Malay Magic\" often exhibit this popular pantheism.]\n\n(8) The first Arabs proper came from the Hadthramaut (vide Journal 77, page 174 and Journal 79, page 49). And the Hadthramaut family of Sayids got the throne of Pontianak in Borneo as well as that of Siak.\n\nDirect Arab influence made itself felt strongly only after the invention of steam-ships had made voyages easy.\nSIDI, SIAMANG, ADUNADA\n\nBy R. O. Winstedt.\n\nOn page 605 of Skeat's \"Malay Magic,\" under LXX occur the lines:\n\nBukan-nya aku yang b\u0113rburu,\nPawang Sidi yang b\u0113rburu;\nBukan-nya aku yang punya anjing,\nPawang Sakti yang punya anjing;\n\non page 640, under CXCIX\n\nMaalim Saidi yang punya tawar\nMaalim Karimun\u00b9 yang m\u0113nawar\n\n\u2014in a Perak MS. Charm-book, Maalim Karimum is found: on page 607 (LXXIII)\n\nBukan aku yang b\u0113rburu,\nTo patek Sang Sidi yang b\u0113rburu:\n\non page 589, XV\n\nAku-lah yang b\u0113rnama Dato M\u0113ntala Guru\nSakti di-rumah:\nS\u0113dang Sidi nama-nya aku:\n\non page 607, LXXVI\n\nO s\u0113rba Saidi\nTuan patek yang punya rusa:\n\non page 590, XVIII\n\nB\u0113rkat Sidi t\u0113rjali s\u0113ndiri,\nM\u0113njadikan sakalian alam.\n\nNow in all the above quotations Sidi is taken to be the name of a person; and in some cases is confused with the Arabic saidi 'lord,' either by the Malay pawang or by his European transcriber. But clearly s\u0113rba Saidi is a very doubtful phrase in the context, if it is to be rendered \"all sorts of Lords;\" and b\u0113rkat Sidi t\u0113rjali s\u0113ndiri, if it referred to a pawang, would ascribe to him preposterous powers. However in the first of the quotations, sidi\n\n\u00b9 A pawang philologist glibly explains yang b\u0113rdiam di-Pulau Karimum (Skeat p. 581). Is it perhaps the Skt. Gariman (= guru + iman.)\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 81, 1920.\nbalances sakti \"gifted with supernatural attributes:\" and that this is apposite and leads us to its true meaning is confirmed by a phrase very common in various forms in Malay charms, e.g. Skeat, page 617 (CIX) and 627 (CXLVII) and 643 (CCVIII):\n\nSidik Guru, sidik-lah aku\nDengan b\u00e9rkat, 'La ilaha illa'llah,\nMuhammad Rasul'llah.'\n\nor to quote from MS. charm-books in my possession, which I hope some day to print and edit,\n\nSah sidi pengajaran guru,\nSidi mustajab ka-pada aku,\nB\u00e9rkat, 'La ilaha,' etc.\n\nThe first line occurs in three different charms: for the second a variant is Sah sidi mustajab, etc. All my charms read sidi. Now a common variant of these the concluding lines of a charm is (Skeat, page 627, CXLI)\n\nKabul Guru, kabul aku\nDengan b\u00e9rkat, 'La ilaha'\n\nor page 603, LX\n\nKabul-lah doa guru aku\nKabul ka-pada aku.\n\nClearly sah, mustajab and kabul are synonyms for sidi. In a line in the \"Ht. Anggun Che Tunggal\" page 1, it balances b\u00e9rkat:\u2014B\u00e9rkat daulat, bersidi sakti. (I remember asking Pawang Ana if he did not mean saidi and his denying it but being unable to explain sidi.) Sidi must be the Sanskrit siddhi (sidh-ti) \"accomplishment, fulfilment, success, the fruit of ascetic austerities, the acquisition of supernatural power by magic:\" with compounds maha-siddhi \"magic power,\" and sadhya-siddhi \"completion, establishing what is to be proved.\" (Benfey's Sanskrit-English Dictionary.) We can then turn from the phrase\n\nB\u00e9rkat sidi t\u00earjali s\u00ebndiri\n\nto the Sanskrit\n\nNavastuno vastusiddhih\n\n'From nothing nothing is derived.'\n\n\"Every Tantra,\" wrote Monier\u2014Williams in his book on Hinduism, \"ought, like a Purana, to treat of five subjects,\u20141. The Creation; 2. The Destruction of the World; 3. The worship of the gods; 4. The attainment of all subjects, especially of 8 superhuman powers (siddhi); 5. The four modes of union with the Supreme Spirit. Very few conform even partially to this rule. Most of them are mere hand-books for the use of practisers of witchcraft....Whole Tantras teach nothing but what may be called the science of employing unmeaning sounds for acquiring magical powers over friends and for destroying enemies and rivals. Some give collections of spells suitable for making people enamoured, for destroying sight, for producing and preventing diseases, for injuring crops, for alchemy.\"\nIndia was the home of Malay magical lore. Before and after the days of Muhammad, India has been until comparatively recent times, the source of nearly all Malay learning, science and art.\n\nSIAMANG.\n\nIn a previous paper I drew attention to the fact that siamang (Hylobates syndactylus) may be derived from the Sanskrit siamanga \u2018black\u2013bodied,\u2019 which by the bye is an epithet descriptive of Budha i.e. the planet Mercury, son of Soma the moon. Now on page 617 (CXI) of Skeat\u2019s \u201cMalay Magic\u201d I find the line\n\nPergi-lah engkau ka-bukit siamang biru\n\nand on page 672 (CCLXXV)\n\nNior manis, siamang bulan.\n\nIs this last a pawang\u2019s cryptic equivalent for gelap bulan?\n\nIn Sanskrit siama means \u2018black, a cloud, shade, shadow, night:\u2019\n\nSo that the pawang\u2019s metaphorical use of siamang would be an extraordinary coincidence or survival.\n\nADUNADA.\n\nOn page 593 (XXVIII) of Skeat\u2019s \u201cMalay Magic\u201d the charm against the Spectre Huntsman mentions a\n\nHantu bota Si Adunada\nMenyandang pedang terbongkok-bongkok.\n\nIs Adunada perhaps a corruption of the Sanskrit anunaaa \u2018echo\u2019? An echo-spirit would be a not inappropriate follower of the Spectre Huntsman.\nPUAKA.\n\nBy Ivor H. N. Evans.\n\nIn Tregear's \"Maori Comparative Dictionary\" is to be found a word poaka, meaning a pig, a hog, and it is stated that the term, generally supposed to be a corruption of the English word \"porker,\" is genuinely Polynesian.\n\nPoaka is found, in varying forms, in many Polynesian dialects and languages. Thus, according to Tregear, we have Samoan\u2014pu'a; Tahitian\u2014puaa; Hawaiian\u2014puaa; Tongan\u2014buaka; Rarotongan\u2014puaka; Marquesan\u2014puaa; Mangarevan\u2014puaka.\n\nOutside Polynesia proper, too, but not outside the bounds of Polynesian linguistic, and other influences, we have such examples as vuaka (Fiji); puaka (Rotuma).\n\nNow to any one who knows Malay the word puaka (or puwaka) is, of course quite familiar. It is not at all uncommon to come across places, often where there is some big tree, which are said to be ber-puaka, i.e., haunted by a puaka. The Malay has however, as far as I have been able to find out, absolutely no idea that puaka has anything to do with \"pig,\" a puaka being apparently, according to Malay belief, a spirit, either a tree spirit or a genius loci.(1)\n\nAmong the Dusuns of British North Borneo(2) the puaka(3) is said to be a spirit which has the form of a pig. The puaka go in companies, hunt human beings, and have the peculiarity\u2014like many spirits\u2014that they cannot cross water with impunity. If they do so, they die, through licking all the flesh from their bones with their sharp tongues.\n\nIn Hawaii, besides being commonly used as the ordinary word for pig, puaka, either by itself, or in combination with some other word, may mean a spirit of some kind, often a spirit in the form of a pig; thus we find in Tregear's dictionary the statement that \"puaa,\" seems to have been originally the name of any large quadruped, but (was?) afterwards restricted to hogs. The word occurs frequently in old legends and myths as descriptive of monsters,\n\n(1) \"The locally presiding earth-demon (puaka),\u2014\u2014\" \"Malay Magic,\" p. 144.\n\nAyer berputar jangan chebok,\nPuwaka besar dudok menunggu\ndon't take your water from an eddy, a mighty demon dwells there to guard it.\" Wilkinson's Malay Dictionary.\n\n(2) Those of Piasau in the Tempasuk District.\n\n(3) The word was, by mistake, written pukou in a folk-story which I collected in Borneo. I am nearly certain, however, that the spelling puaka is correct. For the folk-story vide J. R. A. I., 1913, p. 452.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 81, 1920.\netc. Kama-puaa was a goblin, worshipped as a god, half man and half hog. Poo-puaa was one of the gods in a temple; his head resembled a hog. Kane-puaa was the god of husbandry: *He akua kowaa o Kanepuaa*\u2014\u201ca furrow making god was Tane-poaka.\u201d\n\nNow the pig, as is well known, played, and plays, an important part in agricultural rites in Europe,(1) and, to gain some idea of this, it is only necessary to glance through that part of \u201cThe Golden Bough\u201d which is named \u201cSpirits of the Corn and of the Wild.\u201d Furthermore there is a close connection between tree or vegetation spirits, *genii locorum*, and those of agriculture.\n\nTo return, however, to the word *puaka*, I have shewn that in Polynesia and in Borneo(2) the word can mean a pig-bodied or pig-faced spirit, and that in Polynesia it can mean pig only.\n\nNow there can be no doubt that the word is of identical origin in Polynesia, in Borneo, and in the Malay Peninsula, seeing that the languages of Polynesia and Indonesia all belong to one group.\n\nThe Malays have no idea that *puaka* in any way refers to the pig, but consider a *puaka* to be a tree spirit or a *genius loci*. It seems probable, however, that *puaka* actually did mean pig in Malay at one time, or, if not, a pig-like tree spirit, vegetation spirit, or *genius loci*;(1) but that now-a-days\u2014very likely owing to the introduction of the religion of Mohamed\u2014the connection of pig with *puaka* has been forgotten (suppressed) and there merely remains the belief that the *puaka* is a tree spirit or *genius loci*.\n\n(1) Possibly the fact that wild pig often rout up large pieces of ground in search of worms or roots, so that they almost look as if they had been ploughed, may have had something to do with the respect in which the pig is held in connection with agriculture; *vide supra* the epithet \u201cfurrow-making.\u201d Furthermore the wild pig takes a great interest\u2014an inimical interest\u2014in agriculture. The Sakai tribesmen of some parts of the Malay States believe that the earth spirits, if offended, will appear as wild pigs, and come in droves to devastate the crops. The Dusuns of the Tempasuk District of North Borneo, too, tell how the people (spirits?) from certain villages far away become pigs in order to plunder the ripe padi.\n\n(2) *Puaka* is not the Dusun word for either the domestic or the wild pig.\n\n(1) The *genii locorum* in a jungle-covered country like the Malay Peninsula would probably be those of the jungle, i.e. of trees, especially of those which were large, or in any way remarkable.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nOBITUARY\n\nMR. ABRAHAM HALE. (Dec. 7, 1854\u2014April 8, 1919).\n\nMr. Hale, who retired from the F. M. S. Civil Service in 1911 after twenty-seven years' service, died on April 8th in his sixty-fifth year. He was one of the earliest surviving members of the Society and contributed several notes and papers to early numbers, his principal contribution being on \"Folk-lore and the Menang-kabau Code in the Negri Sembilan\" Journal XXXI. He always lamented with that delightful candour which characterized him, that his literary talent was untrained; but for all that it was a very genuine talent. Had \"The Adventures of John Smith in Malaya\" been written two centuries ago, its author would have ranked with Defoe. Hale had an extraordinary faculty for vivid detail.\n\nLess than a fortnight before he died, he wrote me a letter full of his usual enthusiasm for Malaya and his abundant interest in life; and enclosing a photograph of himself as a private in the Kent Volunteer 'Fencibles. For me as for many others it was a pleasure to have known him and served under him.\n\nR. O. W.\nHikayat Abu Nawas.\n\nBy R. O. Winstedt.\n\nApparently there are no MSS. of this story in England or Holland. There is a MS. in Raffles\u2019 Library, Singapore, in the colophon of which it is stated that the MS. was transcribed at Sungai Kalang, but no date is given: obviously it is not old. Another version has been lithographed in Singapore quite lately, A.H. 1336. The two Singapore texts are identical in subject-matter, and differ little even verbally.\n\nThree MSS. of the Hikayat are in the library of the Batavia-asch Genootschap (Vide van Ronkel\u2019s Catalogus in Deel LVII of the Verhandelingen of that Society: pp. 125-127). The first two of these MSS., Nos. CXXVII and CXXVIII in the Catalogus, give a version different from the Singapore recension. They make Abu Nawas the son not of a Kathi but of a Penghulu. The manteri is given a name, that of the famous Luqman (vide Hughes\u2019 \u201cDictionary of Islam\u201d). On p. 22 of the first MS. there is the story of how Harun a-r-Rashid bade Abu Nawas sew up a broken stone mortar. That MS. is dated 1865 and contains 21 tales. It would appear to be identical with Tjerita Aboe Nawas printed by Albrecht and Rusche in Batavia (3rd edition 1894), of which I give an outline below. MS. No. CXXVIII is described as \u201cinferior, indecent and incomplete,\u201d in all of which respects perhaps it resembles the Singapore texts. The third MS., No. CXXIX, was collected by von der Wall; like the Singapore versions, it makes Abu Nawas the son of a Kathi and omits mention of Luqman.\n\nVan Ophuijsen has printed four tales, (which I have numbered (9), (3), (6) and (7) in my summary below of the Singapore version), on pages 25-6, 115-121 and 152-164 of his Romanized Maleisch Leesboek (Leiden 1912). Ophuijsen does not give the source of his text: slightly better in style and here and there fuller in phrase, it resembles otherwise the Singapore versions very closely both in wording and in matter.\n\n(Here I should like to call the attention of English students to the value of the Readers and Bloemlezing edited by so many Dutch scholars as store-houses of fragments selected from unpublished Malay MSS.).\n\nI have printed two tales, numbered (5) and (13) in my summary of the Singapore version, in P\u00e9lampas Akal, (pp. 36-37, and 63-67) a Romanized Malay Reader for Standard III of the Government Malay Schools: Kelly and Walsh, Singapore, 1919. As it is a school-book, I have emended a few difficulties in the text.\nSo, from the Singapore recension of the *Hikayat Abu Nawas* there will remain only a few unimportant tales (Nos. 1, 2, 4 and 8) fit for publication, that will not be accessible in Romanized Malay.\n\nSnouck Hurgronje\u2019s description of the AChinese recension of the *Hikayat* leaves no doubt that it is more or less identical with the Malay version. \u201cThis Malay work consists not so much of anecdotes from the life of the Arab poet Abu Nawas as a collection of popular tales respecting an imaginary court-fool who has much in common with the German Eulenspiegel and to whom the name of this poet has been given. Compare also the *Contes Kabyles* of A. Moulieras, Introduction: *les Fourberies de Si Jeh'a*, p. 12 (*Bou Na'as*) and M. Hartmann\u2019s *Schwanen und Schnurren*, S. 55 and 61 (*Zeitschrift fur Volkskunde*, 1895\u201d)\u2014\u201cThe AChinese,\u201d vol. II p. 157.\n\nAbu Nawas, (*obiit* A.D. 806-813) one of the greatest Arabian poets was half Persian by birth. His discreditable adventures, quick wit and resource are recorded also in the \u201cArabian Nights.\u201d (*Vide* Abu Nawas, p, 102 \u201cEncyclopaedia of Islam\u201d).\n\nMy summary gives the pages of the Singapore MS. in Raffles\u2019 Library:\n\n(1) Page 1. A Kathi the father of Abu Nawas, lay dying. He bade his son kiss him. Abu Nawas noticed that one of his father\u2019s ears smelt foul, the other sweet. His father related how once he had inclined his ear to one party in a suit but not to the other.\n\n(2) p. 2. Abu Nawas pretends to be mad to avoid succeeding his father as Kathi under Sultan Harun a-r-Rashid.\n\n(3) p. 4. An Egyptian merchant, a sojourner in Baghdad, dreams he has married the new Kathi\u2019s daughter, paying a huge dowry. Hearing of the dream the Kathi demands the dowry and seizes the merchant\u2019s goods in payment for a marriage existing only in a dream. An old woman advises that Abu Nawas be consulted. Abu Nawas orders his pupils to break into the Kathi\u2019s house at night. The Kathi complains to Sultan Harun a-r-Rashid. Abu Nawas declares he dreamt it was done and so he had it done; following the example of the Kathi who had exacted the dowry only dreamt of by the merchant! The Kathi is punished and his goods restored to the Egyptian.\n\nA Malay Mouse-deer story with a similar plot is printed in *Journal* No. 46, 1906, pp. 85-88.\n(4) p. 10. Sultan Harun a\u2019r-Rashid gives Abu Nawas two goats. They are each to be fed with the same quantity of the same food for 40 days. At the end of that time one is to be fat and the other lean. Abu Nawas puts a cat in the pen of one of the goats and the cat\u2019s restless movements keep the goat lean.\n\n(5) p. 12. Harun a\u2019r-Rashid orders Abu Nawas to find six head of cattle, bearded and gifted with speech. Abu Nawas brings bearded louts who cannot say what is the day of the week!\n\n(6) p. 14. Abu Nawas wants money. He invites Harun a\u2019r-Rashid to accompany him to a Bedouin house to hear wonderful music. He induces the Sultan to sit under a tree, while he goes up to a Bedouin agriculturist and sells him Harun a\u2019r-Rashid as a slave.\n\n(7) p. 21. Harun a\u2019r-Rashid wants to kill Abu Nawas for his treachery. Abu Nawas pretends to be dead, having first instructed his wife to ask the Sultan in the presence of all the mourners to forgive all the deceased\u2019s sins towards him in this world and the next. The Sultan does so, whereupon Abu Nawas comes to life.\n\n(8) p. 26. Abu Nawas declines to present himself to court on the plea that he is pregnant; as it appears later, in a metaphorical sense.\n\n(9) p. 30. Harun a\u2019r-Rashid knowing that the mother of Abu Nawas is dead orders him to bring her to court. Promising to divide the reward, 100 dinars, with her, Abu Nawas persuades an old cake-seller to adopt him and brings her. When the Sultan decrees him 100 stripes, Abu Nawas represents that he should get only 50 and the old woman 50, as they had agreed to share alike. The Sultan pardons both.\n\n(10) p. 35. Harun a\u2019r-Rashid, having secretly given a number of divers an egg apiece, calls Abu Nawas and orders them all to dive into a pond: whoever fails to bring up an egg is to be punished. Abu Nawas fails but escapes punishment by protesting that all the others are hens but he a cock!\n\n(11) p. 37. At a maulud gathering, the court attendants sprinkle the company with rose-water but Abu Nawas with ayer s\u00e9ni! Abu Nawas pretends to be ill and when the Sultan\nvisits him recovers and ascribes his recovery to certain pills. The Sultan insists on trying the pills and Abu Nawas administers three in which he had mixed tahi! When the Sultan discovers the trick, Abu Nawas demands hush-money.\n\n(12) p. 41. Abu Nawas, accused of impropriety with a girl in the palace, is put in a tigress' cage but escapes being devoured by an indecent trick.\n\n(13) p. 53. By relating how he had worsted the tigress, Abu Nawas makes the Sultan laugh. The laughter causes an intestinal ulcer, from which the Sultan suffered, to burst.\n\n(14) p. 55. Abu Nawas is captured by Bedouins who would slay and eat him. He offers to find a stout friend to take his place and fetches Harun a'r-Rashid. The Sultan persuades the Bedouins it will be more profitable to let him live and make caps. After six months' captivity he embroiders on a cap a message to his Vizier and is rescued. Abu Nawas saves himself, by pleading that he only wished the Sultan to see the state of his country.\n\n(15 & 16) p. 62. The concluding two connected stories are too indecent even to summarize. Siti Zubaidah, consort of Harun a'r-Rashid, asks to rule for a day in order to punish Abu Nawas, but his Rabelaisian behaviour scares her into her chamber.\n\nThe Tj\u00e8rita Aboe Nawas (Albrecht and Rusche, Batavia) is in poor Batavian Malay. Of three of the tales (Nos. II, IV and XI) I have given versions in Peninsular Malay in Tangga P\u00eang\u00eatahuan, a Jawi Reader for Standard III of the Government Malay Schools (Kelly and Walsh). The following is a summary of the contents of the Tj\u00e8rita:\n\nI. The first section contains substantially tales 1, 2 and 4 of the Singapore recension. Abu Nawas is the son of a penghulu and Luqman is mentioned.\n\nII. The tale of sewing the broken mortar. Cf. the tale of the king of Egypt requiring a broken millstone to be sewn up\u2014\"The story of Ahikar in Syriac, Arabic, etc.,\" Conybeare, Harris and Lewis Smith; Cambridge.\n\nIII. Tale 9 of the Singapore recension.\n\nIV. Harun a'r-Rashid orders Abu Nawas to tell him the number of the stars of heaven and to determine the centre of the world.\n\nV. Harun a'r-Rashid sends Abu Nawas to visit His Highness' sick mother and says, \"I'll slay you whether you report her dead or...\"\nalive. She dies. Abu Nawas returns and sits in silence before the Sultan. Harun asks, \"Is she dead or alive?\" Says Abu Nawas, \"Your Highness has uttered the words, not I.\"\n\nThe original of this story would seem to be that of the Persian king Khusraw Parwiz and the poet Bahlabad (or Barbad) retold a century later by the Arab poet Khalid bin Fayyad (Browne's \"A Literary History of Persia,\" vol. I, p. 17).\n\nVI. Tales 15 and 16 of the Singapore recension.\n\nVII. A coarse indecent tale of how Siti Zubaidah orders the defiling of the house of Abu Nawas who stipulates that the defilement shall be only the one kind ordered.\n\nThis tale occurs in the Arabic Nafhatu'l-Yaman (\"J. and P., A. S. Bengal,\" vol. III, No. 7, July 1907 where the editors suggest it is an oriental version of the story of the pound of flesh.)\n\nVIII. A merchant vows to sacrifice a goat with horns 1 j\u011bngkal wide, if his wife bears him an heir. She bears a child, but the merchant cannot find a goat with horns of the requisite width. The priests tell him that no other kind of goat will serve. He presents himself before Harun a'r-Rashid who consults Abu Nawas. Abu Nawas bids the merchant bring the biggest goat he has got together with the new-born infant. The goat horns are found to measure 1 span (j\u011bngkal) of the infant's hand!\n\nIX. A wealthy man offers 10 d\u011brham to any one who can endure to remain in the chill water of his pond one whole night. A poor old man with the help of Allah endures but the wealthy man refuses to pay, because the poor man's son had lit a fire on the edge of the tank and so, he declares, kept his father warm. Abu Nawas invites the Sultan, the unjust judge who had refused the poor man redress, and the wealthy man to his house where he lights a fire under a tree above which he had hung a pot. Harun points out that he'll never cook his rice because the fire is so far away from the pot. Abu Nawas pleads that the same remark applies to the fire lit on the bank of the pond when the poor man stood in the water. Harun sentences the rich man to pay the poor fellow 100 d\u011brham and imprisons him and the unjust judge.\n\nX. Abu Nawas is bidden to teach a cow (sampi) to recite the Koran. He tries to beat her to death to escape an impossible task.\n\nXI. Abu Nawas undertakes to remove a mosque on his back.\n\nXII. Nakhiebah is an unjust and libertine mant\u011bri. Abu Nawas embroils a young man with him over the sale of a cow; persuades the youth to get admission into the mant\u011bri's house disguised as a girl, and there beat him to death. Nakhiebah is not quite killed. So Abu Nawas disguises the youth as a doctor (dukun) and tells him really to kill the mant\u011bri this time on pretence of treating him. The youth again fails. The mant\u011bri tells his wife to pretend he is dead and bury a banana stem in his stead. He will be hidden\non the bier. Abu Nawas hires a horseman to scatter the mourners, while the young man really kills the mant\u00e9ri, who is actually buried.\n\nXIII. Abu Nawas has a poor relation who wants to trade. To get him capital, Abu Nawas sends his wife Maria to the Sultana, Siti Zubaidah, to say that she wants alms to bury her husband, Abu Nawas, who has just died. Meanwhile he himself goes to Sultan Harun and asks for alms to bury his wife! They both get money and start their kinsman in trade. Maria however keeps back 250 of the 350 d\u0113rham given to her.\n\nXIV. The poor relation loses all his money in trade and enters the service of a Jew, with the stipulation that whoever of them gives the other notice shall forfeit a pound of flesh. The poor trader cannot endure the hard work, and forfeits his pound of flesh. Abu Nawas enters the Jew\u2019s service to avenge his relative. He works well but continually eats his master\u2019s food. The Jew anxious to get rid of him but fearful of forfeiting a pound of flesh determines to kill him. Abu Nawas puts the Jew\u2019s wife in his bed. The Jew kills her and has to flee the country, leaving half his property behind. Abu Nawas asks for one nail out of the property and before the Raja and merchants come to the auction of the Jew\u2019s property hangs stinking meat on it. They pay him 8000 perak in all to remove the meat. He gives the poor relation 1000 perak and the man trades and grows rich.\n\nXV. Harun orders Abu Nawas to get a bearded tiger (machen). Abu Nawas puts up a trap in his house, and after arranging with his wife, goes to an elder of the mosque and tells him that his wife has quarrelled with him. The elder goes off to talk to the lady and finding her fair draws very near to her. Abu Nawas returns and knocks at the door. His wife puts the elder in the cage to hide. Abu Nawas takes the trap with its human victim before the Sultan and the elder is disgraced for ever.\n\nThis forms one incident in the tale of Musang B\u0113rjanggut (J. R. A. S., S. B. No. 52) which is mostly derived from the Suka-saptati (or Sanskrit original of \u201cThe Enchanted Parrot\u201d Wortham\u2019s translation, Tale XXXIII).\n\nXVI. The story how Muhammad Khali by a filthy trick cured his wife of her guilty passion for a bilal.\n\nXVII. Harun a\u2019r-Rashid calls all his advisers except Abu Nawas to choose a name for his son. They select Abdul-Rahman. Abu Nawas annoyed presents himself before the Sultan and declares it is a name fit only for fools. To prove it he goes to the house of a Penghulu Abdul-Rahman, hides money under his mat, pretends to listen to the chirping of birds outside the house and declares the birds are saying there is money under the mat. Abdul-Rahman finds it is so. Abu Nawas repeats the trick for several days. On the seventh day Abu Nawas weeps and says the birds declare that Abdul-Rahman is about to die. To avoid this tragedy, Abdul-\nRahman is persuaded by Abu Nawas to follow his advice, be shrouded and put on a bier; whereupon Abu Nawas takes him before the Sultan as proof that all people of that name are fools.\n\nXVIII. An unsavoury tale of how Abu Nawas gets into disgrace for fouling a stream.\n\nXIX. Harun asks his vizier Ja'far Barmaki (the Barmecide) what the water bubbling in a hookah is saying. He cannot tell. Abu Nawas avers it is asking the news from the burning tobacco.\n\nXX. Harun stipulates that Abu Nawas shall travel neither on the ground, nor in a carriage neither in the sun nor in the shade. Abu Nawas fixes a broken umbrella on a pony's back, puts one foot in a stirrup and ties one to the umbrella and so rides.\n\nXXI. Abu Nawas repays a nasty trick to Harun in kind: tale (11) of the Singapore recension.\n\nXXII. A hump-back has a beautiful wife. A lover impersonates the husband and the wife cannot distinguish between them. Abu Nawas makes a big gendi with two spouts and bids both the fellows scramble through the spouts. The man who sticks is declared to be the real hump-back and the other is punished.\n\nTwo short tales of Abu Nawas, that do not appear in either of the above recensions, are printed in P\u00e9nimbau Akal my Jawi Reader for Standard II of the Government Malay Schools.\n\nIn the large (unpublished) version of the Hikayat Bakhtiar (Raffles' MS. 63, Library of Royal Asiatic Society, London; vide van der Tuuk's \"Account\" in \"Essays relating to Indo-China,\" Second Series, vol. II) among many other tales occur two of Abu Nawas, which Dr. Brandes in his paper on the Hikayat Bakhtiar (\"Tijdschrift voor Ind. T. L. & Vk. v. N., I. Deel XXXVIII\") summarizes as follows:\n\n\"Tale 53. Sleepless, Sultan Harun a-r-Rashid visits a mistress Kamar a-z-zaman. He bids Abu Nawas compose a poem on the incident. It is so lifelike that the Sultan thinks Abu Nawas must have spied on him. But Abu Nawas denies this and gets a reward.\n\nTale 54. Harun a-r-Rashid visits \u0628\u062f\u0631\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0645 a mistress he has neglected. He keeps her standing but she excuses herself from his presence. In vain he awaits her return. He seeks her next day and tells her promises are made to be kept. She replies that one does not do by day what one promises at night. Abu Nawas \u0631\u0642\u0633\u064a and \u0639\u062f\u062f\u064a are bidden to write poems on the incident. Again Abu Nawas is accused of having played eaves-dropper, so lifelike is his poem.\"\nThe Empire of the Maharaja, King of the Mountains and Lord of the Isles.\n\nBy C. O. Blagden.\n\nIn the autumn of the year 671 the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim I Tsing\\(^1\\) sailed from Canton in a Persian ship with the North-East monsoon and in less than twenty days arrived at the country of Fo-she, where he stayed for six months before proceeding to India. Fourteen years later, on his return from India, he stayed there again, this time for four years. All the available evidence points to the conclusion that this Fo-she or Shi-li-fo-she country was Palembang, in Southern Sumatra, and from the 7th century to its conquest by the Javanese of Majapahit about 1377 we get many glimpses of it as a flourishing kingdom of Hindu (and particularly Buddhist) civilization. That much has been common knowledge for a good many years past. Gerini in his *Researches on Ptolemy's Geography of Eastern Asia*, pp. 619-30, has compiled a useful list of dates forming an outline sketch of Palembang history during the period above mentioned, and Wilkinson in *Papers on Malay Subjects: History*, Pt. I, pp. 11-4, has also given a brief account of it (omitting, however, any reference to I Tsing and relying on the very doubtfully identified kingdom of Kandali).\n\nQuite recently, however, the importance of Palembang in relation to the whole course of the local history of the Straits before the 14th century has had fresh light thrown upon it. It is no longer as a single kingdom localized in Southern Sumatra that we must regard it, but as an empire which for several centuries had outstations on both sides of the Straits, by means of which it controlled and took toll of the international trade that passed through them. Viewed in that light, the matter becomes vastly more interesting, for it is linked up with the history of Eastern trade-routes in general and in particular with the sea-route between China and the West. In Ptolemy's time (2nd Century A.D.) trade already went through the Straits, though on occasion it availed itself of various land crossings on the isthmus between Indo-China and the Malay Peninsula, in places where that isthmus narrows and there are convenient gaps in the mountain ridge. No doubt, as navigation progressed, the continuous sea-route through the Straits, in spite of the delays involved by its weak and variable winds, became more and more firmly established as the normal one. And so it remained until Vasco da Gama discovered the new route round the Cape of Good Hope, whereupon for a few centuries the trade was diverted to some extent, only to return again into its old channels by reason of the cutting of the Suez Canal.\n\n\\(^1\\) \"I-Tsing translated by J. Takakusu,\" (1896, Clarendon Press, Oxford).\nIn I Tsing's time Palembang annexed the Malayu country, probably in Central Sumatra somewhere about Kampar or Siak, with a port at which the pilgrim also stayed a while. A century later, there is evidence that Vieng Sa, an inland place south of the Bay of Bandon in what is now Lower Siam and situated about $9^\\circ$ N. lat., was in some way under the control of the \"Mah\u0101r\u0101ja,\" for that was the dynastic style of the King of Palembang. A Sanskrit inscription set up at Vieng Sa\\(^1\\) records the erection in the year 775 of certain Buddhist buildings by order of the King of Srivijaya. This reflects back a ray of light on the kadatuan Srivijaya, the kingdom of Srivijaya mentioned in the Kota Kapur (Western Bangka) inscription\\(^2\\) which is nearly a century older and commemorates an attack on Java. It now seems highly probable that Srivijaya was not the name of the king who set up that inscription but rather of his kingdom. In the middle of the 9th century begins the series of Arabic writers who make much of the empire of the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, which according to them included all the region of the Straits. For the early Arab traders the great emporium was Kalah or Kilah, where there were tin-mines which localize it definitely in the tin-bearing tract of country extending from Southern Tenasserim through the greater part of the Malay Peninsula. Its identification with Kedah is at least highly probable, for Kedah is the port which a traveller from the West would first reach and call at. Ibn Khordadzbeh, the earliest Arab authority who goes into these matters, says that Kilah was six days' journey from the island of Langkabulus (one of the Nicobars, probably Great Nicobar). It is mentioned about the beginning of the 10th century as a dependency of the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, and probably stood in that relation a century or two earlier. It is probably identical with Kie-ch'a (old pronunciation Kada), where I Tsing called on his way to India and whence he sailed in a ship belonging to the king (of Palembang).\n\nBut what throws the strongest light on the extent and importance of the empire of Palembang is the record of its relations with the Tamil dynasty of the Cholas in the 11th century. First, in 1005, there is a grant of a village to a Buddhist temple at Neganpatam built by two Palembang kings, father and son. This grant is in Sanskrit and Tamil; in the Sanskrit portion the names of the two kings are given and the second one is styled \"king of Kat\u0101ha and king of Sr\u012bvishaya.\" Their identity as kings of Palembang is clinched by two entries in the Chinese annals of the Sung dynasty which also give their names and mention embassies from them in 1003 and 1008 respectively. In the Tamil text Kat\u0101ha is called Kid\u0101ram. It is almost certainly Kedah. Some twenty years later the Chola king of that day boasts in his inscriptions of his conquests overseas, resulting in the capture of the king of Kad\u0101ram and the taking of a number of places in his empire, including inter alia the Nicobars, Lambri (near Achin), Kad\u0101ram, Langkasuka (the old\n\n---\n\n1 'Inscriptions du Siam et de la P\u00e9ninsule Malaise,' by M. L. Finot in the 'Bulletin de la Commission arch\u00e9ologique de l'Indochine, 1910.'\n2 J. R. A. S., S. B., No. 64.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 81, 1920.\nsite in Southern Kedah), and Srivishaya itself. Again in 1068 another Chola king claims to have captured Kedah but restored it to its ruler, and a few years later we find that Palembang has persuaded the Chinese Court that the Maharaja is the overlord and the Chola his vassal! From this period of conflict ending thus we may perhaps infer that honours were divided, though it does not appear that Palembang retaliated by a genuine strategical offensive in the 11th century, at any rate.\n\nIt is not unlikely that the attacks on Ceylon in 1250 and between 1270 and 1275 attributed by the Ceylon chronicles to the \"Javaku\" emanated from Palembang. Chao Ju Kua, writing about 1225, represents Palembang as having fifteen provinces or dependencies, including Pahang, Trengganu, Kelantan, Langkasuka, half a dozen more places less easily identified but of which two have been definitely located in Lower Siam, and five others, namely Palembang, Sunda, Kompai, Lambri, and Ceylon, the last named (like some of the others) sending a yearly tribute.\n\nBut before the end of the 13th century the Palembang empire seems to have broken up. Even in 1285 it showed signs of internal decay, for the Chinese author just cited, after enumerating Kompai among the dependencies, devotes a separate chapter to it in which he expressly says: \"Formerly it was a dependency of San-fo-tsi, but after a fight it set up a king of its own.\" Then there was serious pressure from without. Perhaps we may include herein the Javanese expedition of 1275 to \"Malayu,\" though we do not know precisely which part of Sumatra it was aimed at. There was worse trouble in the extreme North of the Peninsula, where the Malay forces were falling back before the growing Siamese kingdom whose capital was then at Sukhodaya, far away to the North, near the Lao country. The Mon chronicles speak of these conflicts at some date not long before 1280, and the Chinese records say that they had been going on for many years before 1295. The upshot was that the northern outstations of Palembang in the Peninsula were included in Lower Siam. About the same time Islam was making its first and as yet peaceful conquests in Northern Sumatra, and little places like Perlak, Pasai, and Samudra set up as independent states and made a bid for a share in the trade of the Straits.\n\nSomewhere about the same period, possibly a little earlier, Singapore must also have become independent and begun to take advantage of its unique position. For plainly the command of the Straits so long exercised by Palembang rested not on nature but on force: it was quite off the direct trade-route. So long as by threats of what we should call piracy it could compel trading ships to come into its ports and there pay toll, it did so, even as late as the early part of the 13th century, as Chao Ju Kua tells us. But already in his time it would seem that about a third of the merchants from China put in at Ling-ya-m\u00f4n (Straits of Linggi, or I think more probably Singapore) before going on to\nPalembang. Probably this Ling-ya-m\u00f6n, wherever it was, was only a dependency and so Palembang got the tolls anyhow. But when the outstations began to drop away, the old monopoly was gone and the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja lost his hold on the trade which he had controlled and taxed for some six centuries. For why should traders go out of their way, when the short cut lay by Singapore?\n\nComparing these somewhat scanty historical facts with the legends handed down by tradition and embodied in Malay literature, one is tempted to see in the mythical expedition of Raja Suran down the Malay Peninsula (S\u0113jarah M\u0113layu, chapt. I) a vague reflection of the Chola raids of the 11th century, while the tales of friendly correspondence between Malay and Indian kings may well be based on half forgotten memories of a state of things that really existed for several centuries. There is evidence enough in Malay titles, place-names, and many other words, of the strong influence which Indian civilization had on Western Indonesia. Knowing something now of the course of history, even if it is merely in rough outline, one can understand why the S\u0113jarah M\u0113layu makes the kings of Singapore descend from the royal family of Palembang, the great state which played such a leading part for such a long time; and an epithet in the dynastic style of that family throws light on the myth of the origin of the Singapore house.\n\nBoth in the Vieng Sa inscription and in the earliest of the Chola records above referred to, the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja is said to be \u201cof the family of the king of the mountains.\u201d This, with all the other evidence, establishes the fact that the same dynasty is referred to in both inscriptions and also accounts for what puzzled Mr. Wilkinson (op. cit., p. 11), namely the legend of the appearance of the three princes on Mount Siguntang Mahameru. That is not a national Malay legend but an echo of the dynastic tradition of the Palembang family which claimed to spring from \u201cthe king of the mountains.\u201d What mountain or mountains the Hindu or Hinduized dynasty of Palembang conceived itself to have come from, we do not know. Possibly it may have been a mountain in India, though the later Malay legend locates it in Southern Sumatra. Nor does it very much matter. But the epithet definitely proves that the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja of Srivijaya who set up the inscription at Vieng Sa in what is now lower Siam was head of the state which more than two centuries later was ruled by the kings who built the temple at Negapatam. And that state was I Tsing\u2019s Shi-li-fo-she, the Sarbaza or Sribuza of the Arabs, no longer to be read as Sri Bhoja but Srivijaya, and certainly Palembang.\n\nFor these important additions to our knowledge of Malay history we are indebted to an excellent paper by M. G. C\u0153d\u00e8s in the Bulletin de l\u2019Ecole Fran\u00e7aise d\u2019Extr\u00eame-Orient (1918), Tome XVIII, No. 6, entitled \u201cLe Royaume de Crivijaya,\u201d to which the reader should refer for the details of the evidence and many further particulars. The conclusions arrived at seem irresistible. At the very least, they point to the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja of Palembang having held\nfor several centuries a number of \"Straits Settlements,\" the northernmost of which made him for some time a near neighbour of the great Indo-Chinese power of Camboja. In fact a relatively late (probably 12th century) inscription referring to him and apparently executed by his order is in the Cambojan language, but in a script which in those days was common in Western Indonesia and is almost identical with the contemporary script of Burma.\n\nWhat bearing has all this on the date when the Malays first really colonized the Peninsula? Apart from the few northern settlements actually mentioned, it is hard to say. But it seems reasonable to assume that the Mah\u0101r\u0101ja garrisoned these with his own people. K\u0113dah, therefore, may have been the first really Malay (or at any rate Sumatran) settlement in the Peninsula, and there were others beyond it, in the country that is now Siamese. But we hear nothing of settlements in the South of the Peninsula, except Singapore and that at no very early date. This seems to fit in pretty well with the evidence that the North contained fairly civilized Buddhist states, while there is comparatively little trace of civilization in the South in pre-Muhammadan days.\n\nTo what period then must we refer the Mon-Khmer influence which is incontestably evidenced by the linguistic characteristics of the \"aborigines\" of the Peninsula, for instance by the unquestionably Mon numerals of the Southern Sakai (B\u0113sisi, etc.)? Are we compelled to push it further back than the 7th or 8th century A.D.? Or must some other explanation be invented to account for it? Did the so-called aborigines drift into the Peninsula from Indo-China after the Malay colonization had actually begun? That seems very improbable, but it is difficult to feel positive about the matter; there are still too many unknowns in the history of the Peninsula. It seems certain now that some portions of it, at any rate, fell under Sumatran political influence as early as the 7th or at latest the 8th century. But at first they were merely trading stations, and it does not follow that Malay colonization on a large scale set in immediately. Perhaps some day the veil which shrouds the early history of the Peninsula will be still further lifted. In the meantime we have to thank M. G. C\u0153d\u00e8s for the new light he has thrown on a very obscure matter. He has focussed upon it evidence derived from many sources and has added to the subject a new interest.\n\nPostcript.\n\nSince the above was written, Dr. N. J. Krom, formerly head of the Archaeological Survey in the Dutch East Indies and now Professor of the Archaeology and Ancient History of the Dutch East Indies in the University of Leyden, has contributed some very important and interesting additional facts to the discussion. In his inaugural address of the 3rd December, 1919, he pointed out that the evidence of Javanese inscriptions shows that as early as 778 A.D. the dynasty of \"the king of the mountains\" was ruling Central Java, and it seems to have continued to do so for about a century, during which period it erected important monu-\nments there. Meanwhile Eastern Java was under another dynasty, which claimed South Indian origin. It would appear that in those early days the Sumatran house was the more powerful. It continued to maintain, or at any rate claim, supremacy over Western Java (Sunda) till about 1200 A.D. There is much reason to believe that its influence on the development of Indian civilization in Java was very great, and that amongst other things it was the means of introducing the Mahayana form of Buddhism (which we know prevailed at Palembang) into Java.\n\nIt seems, therefore, that we have to conceive the existence, during the period in question, of two great rival powers in the Archipelago, the one centred in Southern Sumatra, the other in Eastern Java. Until well into the 13th century, the former was the stronger. Then, by degrees, the Javanese power, soon to be centred at Majapahit, gained upon it, and eventually completed its ruin by conquering its capital and many of its outlying possessions and dependencies somewhere about 1377 A.D.\n\nC. O B.\nHISTORY OF KEDAH.\n\nBy R. O. WINSTEKT.\n\nAn Arab voyager Ibn Khordadzbeh (846 A.D.) wrote in his *Kitab al-masalik wa-l mamalik* of an island called \"Kilah\" which contained tin mines and bamboo forests. Another Arab voyager Sulaiman (851 A.D.), edited about 920 A.D. by one Abu Zaid of Siraf, wrote of \"Kalah-bar,\" as \"a dependency of Zabej,\" which is probably Srivijaya i.e. Palembang:\u2014Chao Ju Kua in 1250 A.D. recorded that Langkasuka (i.e. Kedah), Trengganu, Pahang and Kelantan were all subject to Palembang. (\"Encyclopaedie van Nederlandsch-Indie\" sub \"Tochten,\" \"Livres du Merveilles de l'Inde, Leyden 1883-6, pp. 255-264 and Reinaud's \"Relations des voyages faits par les Arabes et les Persans,\" pp. LXII, LXXXV, 17, 93, 94.) Ibn Muhalhal, who flourished about 941 A.D. (but whose account is of doubtful authenticity), describes \"Kalah\" as the last place visited by ships going eastward, a great city with high walls and gardens and canals, \"where are the mines of lead\" or tin \"called kala'i, which is found in no part of the world except Kalah;\" a place famous for the best \"swords\" in India; its inhabitants were Buddhists. \"Kilah\" or \"Kalah\" is generally identified as Kedah: the mention of tin-mines places it certainly in the Malay Peninsula, as Bangka was discovered much later. And probably this \"Kalah\" is identical with \"Kora\" or \"Kala\" of the Chinese chronicles of the T'ang Dynasty (618-916):\u2014pp. 241-3, Vol. I, Series II, \"Essays relating to Indo-China\"; \"Kora\" had a king whose family-name was Sri Pura and his personal name Misi Pura; \"the dead were buried and their ashes put into a jar and sunk in the sea; the customs of the people were about the same as in Siam.\"\n\nThe history of the Liang dynasty (502-665 A.D.) (ib. pp. 135-7) gives an account of a country called Langgasu or Langga, whose people said that their country had been established 400 years earlier: its inhabitants were ardent Buddhists. This, it is sometimes said, is a reference to Langkasuka, the old name of Kedah recorded in the *Hikayat Marong Mahawangsa* and in popular folktales\u2014\"Fasciculi Malayenses,\" pt. II (a), pp. 25-6; Skeat's \"Fables from an Eastern Forest,\" pp. 49-51 and 81) \"Kedah may very well be the old native name of the country and Langkasuka its literary name. Many places in Further India and the Islands bear two names: thus, Pegu was styled Hamsawati, Tumasik was called Singapura: similarly Siak (in Sumatra) is known as Seri Indrapura, and many other such instances could be given. All this merely illustrates the varnish of Indian culture, which spread over these regions during the first dozen centuries or so of our era.\"\nOne may add to these instances Indrapura the old court name for Pahang. The term Langkasuka now survives only as the name of a small tributary to the upper reaches of the Perak river. The *Ht. Marong Mahawangsa* relates how Sri Mahawangsa, the third ruler of Kedah, removed (to Serokam) from Langkasuka, because it was too far from the sea. (J. R. A. S., S. B. 72, p. 64): \"it lay near Gunong Jerai\" (ib. No. 53, p. 148). The Javanese poem, the *Nagara-kretagama* composed in 1365 A.D., mentions both Kedah and Langkasuka among a list of Peninsular settlements tributary to Majapahit (ib. pp. 145-9). But though Langkasuka was an old name for Kedah, the Chinese Langa-ya-hsiu is more likely to have been Tenasserim.\n\nOf the prevalence of the Buddhist religion evidence exists in certain inscriptions found in Kedah and Province Wellesley, going back according to Kern to 400 A.D. (ib. No. 49, pp. 95-101) and having a Southern Indian Sanskrit alphabet; and again in inscribed clay tablets found in Kedah in a cave, nine feet above the floor, written according to Kern in Nagari of the 10th century and therefore from Northern India. (ib. No. 39, p. 205 and cf. J. and P., A. S. Bengal, Vol. III, No. 7, July 1907, where Rakshaldas Banerji has identified five votive tablets from Trang as relics of Mahayana Buddhism belonging to the western group of the Northern Indian Nagari characters of the 11th century A.D., resembling the characters of the Benares grant of Karnadeva and the grants of the Rathors of Kanauj.) Chula (Coromandel) records claim that Kedah was conquered by a Chula king in the 11th century.\n\nAccordingly we know of Kedah till the end of 14th century that it was famous as a mart for tin; its people were Buddhists, and the predominant influence was Indian. Besides this we know that first Palembang and the Chula kings and then the great Javanese kingdom of Majapahit claimed suzerainty over it.\n\nThe *Hikayat Marong Mahawangsa* or \"Kedah Annals,\" as the work is termed, records seven pre-Muhammadan rulers of Kedah bearing the Sanskrit-Siamese titles of Marong Mahawangsa, Marong Mahapodisat, Sri Mahawangsa, Sri Indrawangsa, Maha Parita Baria (Raja Bersiong), Phra Ong Maha Podisat, and of Phra Ong Mahawangsa who became its first Muhammadan ruler under the style of Mudzaffal Shah. Some of these titles are not Indian but Indo-Chinese; 'Podisat' for example is 'Bodisat' and the change of sound from sonants to surds is neither Indian nor Malay but characteristically Indo-Chinese occurring in Mon, Khmer, Siamese and Burmese. This is evidence that Kedah fell, after the fall of Palembang and the decay of Majapahit, under the influence of its Northern neighbours, the Siamese.\n\nAn Achinese account gives 1474 A.D. as the date of the conversion of the first king of Kedah to Islam (Journal of the Indian Archipelago Vol. III, p. 480 and J. R. A. S., April 1909, p. 527).\nAnd the likelihood of that date is confirmed by the story in the *S\u00e9jarah Melayu* of a Raja of Kedah coming to Malacca to ask for the *nobat* (or royal insignia) from Sultan Mahmud Shah, the last Malay ruler of Malacca, who was driven out by the Portuguese conquest in 1511 A.D. and died in 1513 A.D. (*Leyden\u2019s \u201cMalay Annals,\u201d* pp. 321-3). It is reasonable to suppose that the ruler of Kedah was then a Malay. Here, one may observe that in popular tales the Kedah dynasty begins with a tusked cannibal king, the son of an ogress; Blagden has shown that the legend is borrowed from India and is copied from the Buddhist Jataka tales (*J. R. A. S., S. B. No. 79*): it is possible, however, that the story was adapted to symbolize that the ancestry of the dynasty is not purely Malay.\n\nThe Portuguese Barbosa, whose manuscript is dated Lisbon 1516, describes Kedah \u201cas a place of the kingdom of Siam;\u201d to the port \u201can infinite number of ships resort, trading in all kinds of merchandise. Here come many Moorish ships from all quarters. Here, too, is grown much pepper, very good and fine which is conveyed to Malacca, and thence to China.\u201d (\u201cRemusio,\u201d Vol. 1, p. 318). The influence of Siam cannot have been great to allow a Raja of Kedah to go to Malacca at the beginning of the 16th century to get regalia from a Malay suzerain! Nor was it great enough to save Kedah from attack by the Portuguese. In 1611 according to De Faria, Dioge de Medoca Furtado sailing down from Tenasserim to Malacca destroyed the towns of \u201cQuedah and Parles\u201d with fire and sword (*Danvers\u2019 \u201cPortuguese in India,\u201d* Vol. 11, p. 164).\n\nAgain Siamese influence did not baulk Acheen. In 1619 Sultan Iskandar Muda, or Mahkota Alam as he was styled, led the rulers of Kedah and Perak into captivity. The Kedah prince was Sultan Sulaiman Shah (*J. R. A. S., S. B. 72*, p. 123). Achinese influence lasted some years. (*J. I. A. III,* p. 480). The \u201cKedah Annals\u201d have a curious jumbled story that on the conversion of Sultan Mudzaffal Shah to Islam, the king of Acheen and one Shaikh Nuru\u2019d-din sent him two religious treatises the *Siratu'l-mustakim* and the *Babu'n-Vikah*. Now the *Siratu'l-mustakim* was done into Malay by the said Shaikh Nurud-din Muhammad Jilani ibn Ali ibn Hasanyi ibn Muhammad Hamid a'r-Raniri in the year 1634 A.D. (*Juynboll\u2019s \u201cCatalogue of Malay MSS. in Leiden University Library,\u201d* p. 257). That detail helps us to fix a date for the composition (or more probably a late recension) of the *Ht. Marong Mahawangsa*. But considering not only that the Achinese annals and the *S\u00e9jarah Melayu* point to the close of the XVth century as the time of Kedah\u2019s conversion to Islam but also that Sultan Mudzaffal Shah the first convert is always regarded as the great-great-great-grandfather of Sultan Sulaiman Shah who was taken to Acheen in 1619 A.D., it is a detail which discredits entirely the chronology of the \u201cKedah Annals.\u201d From the confusion of rulers it must have been interpolated long after 1634.\n\n*R. A. Soc., No. 81, 1920.*\nThe list of the early Muhammadan kings given in those \"Annals\" is as follows:\n\nMudzaffal Shah (Phraong Mahawangsa)\n\nMuazzam Shah Raja Muhamad Shah Sulaiman Shah\n(reigned at Kota Palas) (ruled Langkapuri)\n\nMuhammad Shah\n\n(? Mansur Shah)\n\nMahmud Shah\n\nSulaiman Shah\n(carried to Acheen 1619 A.D.)\n\nIt was in the reign of Sultan Muazzam Shah, the second Muhammadan ruler of Kedah, that the \"Kedah Annals\" profess in their preface to have been composed (J. R. A. S., S. B. 72, p. 37). If that statement is true at any rate of the nucleus of the book, it would be for Malay histories of a very respectable age indeed. But that there have been many recensions is clear not only from the incident of Shaikh Nuru'd-din's Siratu'l-mustakim, but also, as we shall see, from the completion of the list of rulers down to very recent times (ib. p. 123). Another anachronism may be the mention of Kuala Changgong, if that name means Rangoon, which latter name dates from 1755 A.D. only.\n\nJust as Siamese influence had not saved Kedah from the Portuguese and the Achinese, so too it did not save it from the Dutch. Having trade routes not only from Singapore but from Patani it was a very important centre. \"On the 11th July 1642, the king of Kedah, whom Matelief had visited in 1606, agreed with the (Dutch East India) Compagnie to let her have half of the tin-production of his country at a fixed price and not to admit ships without the Compagnie's permit. An attempt was made to obtain a similar contract from Perak which was richest in tin. But that country refused, giving as a reason its vassalage to Acheen. On Kedah a tight hold was kept. The instructions to 'break up the office there' (1686) also contained orders 'for the blockade of its port.' This command was repeated three years later: the Governor was told to 'blockade the river of Kedah as closely as possible;' in 1663 the 'Dagregister' mentions that 'the river of Queda is still being blockaded' and in 1664 the Netherlands Indian Government resolves, in spite of the king's wish for peace, 'to continue the blockade of Queda on the old footing.' Kedah did not bear this meekly; in 1676 Governor Bort writes to Batavia that 'the Compagnie's cruising sloops had been assailed many times about Pera and Queda by Malay pirates.' And shortly afterwards he reports that 'about Dinghdingh another sloop with a crew of six had been rushed by the Quedaze pirates owing to the crew's own\ncarelessness. All of the crew were severely wounded and the scoundrels could not be overtaken.' Gold came from Kedah and elephants. In the first quarter of the 18th century Valentijn writes that 'several offices, to wit Peirah, Kedah, Ujang Salang and Indragiri are subordinate to the Government of Malacca' (J. R. A. S., S. B. 67, pp. 57-84).\n\nIn spite of having done nothing to ward off the aggression of Portuguese, Chinese and Dutch, Siam still claimed suzerainty over Kedah. \"Reference might\" be \"had to the works of Abbe Choisy in 1686 and to M. de la Loubere's History of Siam in 1678; by both of whom Kedah is described as being, at least, tributary to Siam. It rebelled according to these authors in 1720 (!)\u2014a fact implying subjection\u2014but was speedily reduced by Siam to obedience\" (J. I. A. III, p. 601, Col. Low).\n\nTrouble of a milder kind was impending from another quarter. Thomas Bowrey says that there was a British factory in Kedah from 1669 till 1675 but that it was a complete failure.\n\nIn 1770 affliction came from yet another side. The Bugis, having established themselves in Selangor, attacked Kedah and burnt the town. Is the invasion of Kedah by Kelana Hitam (J. R. A. S., S. B. 72, p. 83) an interpolation in the Ht. Marong Mahawangsa perhaps reminiscent of this attack?\n\nAccounts of the events leading up to and consequent on the acquisition of Penang and Province Wellesley by the British appear in J. R. A. S., S. B. No. 67 pp. 76-7, and in Swettenham's \"British Malaya,\" pp. 42-53. A version more favourable to the British and more closely based on the treaties and correspondence (\"Treaties and engagements entered into or effecting the Native States of the Peninsula:\" Singapore 1889, pp. 61-71) may be read in Wright and Reid's \"The Malay Peninsula,\" pp. 49-87.\n\nJust before the Siamese invasion, Kedah acting on instructions from Siam had attacked Perak and in 1819 claimed to have conquered it.\n\nTreated in 1786 as an independent state, Kedah was recognized by England in 1826 as tributary to Siam. There were two reasons for this recognition. The immediate object was to prevent the Siamese from co-operating with the Burmese during the first Burmese war; and there was the further object of defining the position of Siam in the north of the Malay Peninsula. The Treaty recognized Penang and Province Wellesley as English countries. It laid down that Perak was independent and should not be attacked: the Raja could send the gold and silver flowers to Siam if he liked. The Siamese were to remain in Kedah; and the English were not to allow the exiled Raja of Kedah to settle in Penang, Province Wellesley, Perak, Selangor or Burma. (Aitchison's \"Treaties, Engagements and Sanads;\" vol. II, pp. 351, 369-71).\n\nThe MSS. of the Ht. Marong Mahawangsa, that used by Low (J. I. A. Vol. III), that in the Maxwell collection at the Library of the Royal Asiatic Society (London). Wilkinson's edition re-\nprinted in J. R. A. S., S. B. 72, and von de Wall's MS. now in the library of the Batavia Society (van Ronkel's \"Catalogus,\" Verhandelingen van het Bataviaasch Genootschap Deel LVII, pp. 290-294) all give the same list of the Muhammadan rulers of Kedah down to Ahmad Taju'd-din who ascended in 1820 A.D. After Sulaiman Shah, who died at Acheen the list continues:\n\nSulaiman Shah  \n(d. 1620 A.D.)\n\nRijalu'd-din Shah  \n(Marhum Naga)\n\nMuhiyyu'd-din Mansur Shah  \n(Marhum Sena)\n\nDziy\u00e4u'd-din Mukarram Shah  \n(Marhum hilir atau Marhum ka-balai)\n\nAta'u'llah Muhammad Shah  \n(Marhum Bukit Pinang)\n\nMuhammad Jiwa Zainal-abidin Muazzam Shah  \n(Marhum K\u00ebyangan. Moved to Alor Star. 1741*-1778)\n\nAbdullah al-Mukarram Shah  \n(Marhum Muda, Bukit Pinang; d. 1798)\n\nDzi\u00e4u'd-din Muzzam Shah  \n(Marhum K\u00ebyangan; 1799; abdicated after 2 years; d. 1818)\n\nAhmad Taju'd-din Halim Shah  \n(Marhum Malacca; 1801-; d. ?1844)\n\nZainu'l-Rashid Shah  \n(d. circa 1854)\n\nAhmad Taju'd-din Mukarram Shah  \n(d. 1879)\n\nZainu'l-Rashid  \nAbdu'l-Hamid  \nAbdu'l-Aziz,  \nMuazzam Shah.  \nHalim Shah.  \nRaja Muda.  \n(d. 1881)  \n(d. 1907)\n\nNewbold gives the dates for Muhammad Jiwa Zainal-abidin and Abdullah but seems to have got the family relationships wrong. For the names and dates after Ahmad Taju'd-din, who died about 1844 A.D., I am indebted to a list compiled for Mr. E. A. G. Stuart\n\n* There is a coin of this ruler dated 1154 A.H. = 1741-2 (Millies)\" 'Recherches sur les Monnaies des Indig\u00e8nes de l'Archipel Indien et de la Peninsula Malaise' (1871), p. 133 and plate. Cf. J. R. A. S., S. B., No. 27, p. 132).\nby Wan Yahaya Haji and also to the account in the \"Straits Directory.\" Ahmad Tajuddin Halim Shah began his reign at Kuala Kedah. In 1821 the Siamese invaded Kedah and he fled to Province Wellesley and Klawai. The Siamese ruled Kedah for 23 years, dividing it into four parts: (1) Kedah, (2) Setul ruled by Tunku Bisun, (3) Perlis ruled by Sayid Husain Jamalu'd-din, (4) Kubang Pasu ruled by Tunku Anum. In six years the population was reduced from 180,000 to 6,000. In 1831 Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin was removed to Malacca; in 1836 having got permission to leave Malacca for a visit to Deli he went to Bruas and prepared to attack Kedah, when a British gun-boat captured and took him to Penang. In 1843 Kedah, the division, was restored to him under Siamese protection and he returned to reign at Kota Kuala Muda, as Alor Star was overgrown with forest. He was buried at Langgar. Later Kubang Rusa was restored to Kedah, but Perlis remains independent and Setul is still a part of Siamese territory.\n\nIn 1909 suzerainty over Kedah and Perlis was transferred by Siam to Great Britain.\n\nThere are two interesting points in the \"Kedah Annals\" which deserve remark. Allusion is made to the fact that Gunong Geriang, Gunong Jerai and Gunong Jambul were once islands (J. R. A. S., S. B. 72, p. 69). Now geologists tell us this is true, but it was thousands of years ago, too far back for tradition to have come down; so that presumably Malays must have observed the evidence of sea-shells inland and drawn haphazard the correct conclusion.\n\nAgain, the \"Annals\" record a Kedah legend (which I shall show in the next Journal to be of foreign origin) as to the founding of Perak (ib., p. 62 and No. 9, pp. 85-86 and J. R. A. S., April 1905) and say that the palace of the Kedah Raja who became the first ruler of Perak was erected at Pulau Indra Sakti. But according to Perak history recorded in the Misa Melayu, an XVIIIth century history of that state, Sultan Iskandar who came to the throne in 1765 A.D. was the first ruler of Perak to build a palace on an island down the Perak River, called Chempaka Sari, till he changed its name into Indra Sakti. The legend of the \"Annals\" is a late interpolation. But does it refer to an earlier Pulau Indra Sakti? Did Kedah ever hold continuous sway over the northern part of Perak, before the present Perak dynasty was founded? On these points there is no evidence.\n\nI am indebted to Mr. C. O. Blagden for much valuable information towards the preparation of this paper: and in connection with it should be read his article in this number of the Journal on \"The Empire of the Maharaja.\"\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 81, 1920.\nTAJU'S-SALATIN.\n\n\"The Crown of Kings.\"\n\nBy R. O. Winstedt.\n\nDutch scholars have done much towards preparing a history of Malay literature, but as Dr. Ph. S. van Ronkel, the successor of van Ophuijsen in the chair of Malay at Leiden, points out in the paper (Tijdschrift Ind. T. L. en Vk., deel XVI) which I here summarize, a great deal remains to be studied not only as to the spread of tales in the Archipelago itself but as to the source and date of borrowings from Arab, Persian and Indian literature. Brandes has studied the sources of the Hikayat Bayan Budiman, the Hikayat Kalila dan Damina, the Hikayat Gholam and the Hikayat Bakhtiar; van Ronkel has written a book on the Ht. Amir Hamza and papers on the Taju's-Salatin, the Ht. Gul Bakawali (Le Roman de la Rose dans la literature malaise), the Ht. Tamim ad-dari and the Ht. Sama'un and above all an exhaustive catalogue of the great collection of Malay MSS. in the possession of the Batavian Society, of which it suffices to say that it is a worthy counterpart of Juynboll's catalogue of the Malay MSS. at Leiden. Gradually material for a history is being accumulated. But the field is dreary and the labourers are few.\n\nEarly scholars supposed that Malay borrowings were from the Arabic. Now we know that not even all Malay theological works were translated from the Arabic. India has been the source of much Malay literature and of popular mysticism:\u2014vide Snouck Hurgronje's book on \"The Achehnese.\" For a long time Persian was the official language of India, especially of northern India. To the Persian language, but not therefore to direct Persian influence, Malay is indebted for its script, the name of its vowel points, certain loan-words and many legends and romances. Sometimes the borrowing has been direct, sometimes by way of some Indian translation. The comparison of Malay romances with Hindustani and Tamil literature might well engage the interest of our local students of those languages.\n\nFor the Taju's-Salatin, van Ronkel alludes to the eulogies unduly bestowed on this work by Roorda van Eysinga, its first editor, and by the grammarian Werndly. That sound scholar van der Tuuk gave a note of warning and criticized the poorness of van Eysinga's text: a criticism repeated by Blagden and myself on p. 189 of our \"Malay Reader\" (Clarendon Press).\n\nWerndly and van Eysinga call the author Bokhari of Johore. The true explanation is that he was \"a Bokhari,\" a native of Bokhara, practising the trade of a jauhari \"a jeweller.\"\n\nEth\u00e9 in his account of modern Persian literature speaks of a Bokhari Jauhari mentioned in the literary biography of Suhuf\nIbrahim as a court panegyrist under the Seljukian princes, Malik-shah (1152), Muhammad (1153-1160), Sulaiman Shah and Arslan Shah bin Tughrul (1161-1176), who wrote an epic called *Hikayat-i Amir Ahmad u Mahisti*. But to judge from references to books in the *Taju's-Salatin*, this man lived too early to be our author.\n\nThe introduction to the *Taju's-Salatin* acknowledges indebtedness to many sources. These sources have Arabic titles, but some are well-known Persian works found also in Arabic, and some Persian translations from the Arabic. One of the sources given is the *Akhlag-i-Muhsini*, written in 1494 by Husain bin Ali alwaiz al Kashifi.\n\nOn page 43 (van Eysinga\u2019s text) the author quotes from the *Tanhibu'l-Ghafilin*; probably an Arabic religious tract translated into Persian\u2014there are several works of that name, Persian, one Hindustani and at least one in Malay (van Ronkel\u2019s \u201cCatalogus\u201d of MSS. at Batavia, p. 412; and a Malay version has been printed at Mecca and is on sale in Singapore). The *Sijar u'l Muluk*, a well-known Persian work composed by the famous Vizier Nizam u'l Mulk, born in 1017, is referred to on pp. 65 and 203. A Persian ethical treatise (*Eth\u00e9* p. 347) is cited on p. 116. A Persian verse is quoted on p. 117 out of the \u2018Secrets of Attar,\u2019 a Persian work by the famous mystic and poet, Abu Hamid Muhammad bin Abibakr Ibrahim Farid u'd Din Attar, a dealer in perfumery who died 114 years old in 1230. On p. 151 is mentioned the famous Persian romance of Mahmud and Ayaz: the oldest version is by Fashru\u2019d Din Ali Safi (died 1532), but there are others by Anisi (died 1605), Zulali (composed 1593-1615), Mirza Muhammad Ali Saib (d. 1677) and later by Mir Abu Talib. On the same page are mentioned the \u201cArab story\u201d of Laila wa Majnun and the \u201cPersian stories\u201d of Khusrau wa Shirin, and of Yusof and Zulaikha. The story of Khusrau and Shirin is told in verse by Fashru\u2019d Din Asad Nizami and by many later writers. Firdausi and earlier authors have told the story of Yusof and Zulaikha.\n\nThe introduction to the *Taju's-Salatin*, the type of book, the names of princes and ministers are all Persian. In Persian more than in Arabic ethical treatises one finds verses, stories and texts from the Koran introduced. The verses in the book are all in forms of Persian prosody, the *mathnavi*, *rubai*, *ghazal*: they are mostly didactic or sing the praises of the first four khalifs or of the merits of the author\u2019s work. On p. 47 Kayomarz the first of the old kings of Persia is mentioned as a son of Adam. Cf. also p. 102.\n\nSometimes a Persian word is explained, *e.g.* on p. 134, by a later hand. The Persian word for the New Year is used. There are Persian forms of the genitive: *e.g.* Omari-Abdul-Aziz.\n\nThe chronogram in the introduction gives 1012 A.H. (1603 A.D.) as the date of composition.\n\nThough no Persian original has been discovered, clearly the book is of Persian origin and, considering there was no direct Persian influence on the Malays, probably was derived from India.\nThe Genealogy of Malacca's Kings from a copy of the Bustanu's-Salatin.\n\nBy R. O. Winstedt.\n\nThis interesting and important passage was copied for the late Mr. W. Barnes from a copy of the Bustanu's-Salatin belonging, it is said, to H. H. the late Sultan of Pahang, when H. H. was still Tengku Besar. Apparently it had been the intention of Mr. Barnes to offer it to the Society, but death frustrated him.\n\nThe interest of the passage lies in the light it throws on Malay history. Firstly, it gives the variant list of the kings of Singapore and Malacca, to which Wilkinson drew attention on pp. 15 and 21 of his History, Part I, Papers on Malay Subjects Kuala Lumpur, F.M.S. 1908. It gives the orthodox list of the Malacca royal house down to the date of the Portuguese conquest and then continuing their history down to the birth of Sultan Iskandar Ala'u'd-din Mughayat Shah II of Acheen (1636-1641) it throws light on the earlier history of Pahang and Johor.\n\nIt had been the intention of Mr. Barnes to compare this version with the version of the Bustanu's-Salatin at Leyden, but it is hard for Europeans in the East to find time and opportunity for such comparative work. Print our local manuscripts, when obtainable, and once in print passages can easily be compared. Mr. Barnes had got one variant version, the source of which I have been unable to trace: its variants I have cited in foot-notes.\n\nThe Bustanu's-Salatin was composed at Acheh by Shaikh Nuru'd-din Muhammad Jilani ibni Hasanji ibni Muhammad Hamid a'r-Raniri, who also composed an Ht. Iskandar Dzu'l-Karnain in Malay as he tells us on p. 14, vol. II of Wilkinson's edition of the Bustanu's-Salatin: in 1634, he had translated the Siratu'l-mustakim into Malay. (Vide also Snouck Hurgronje's \"The Acehnese,\" vol. I, p. 12). After the fall of Pasai, Malacca, and after the conquest of Malacca, Acheen became the centre of Muhammadan religion and learning. It was Sultan Iskandar the second of Acheen and Shaikh Nuru'd-din who sent the Babu'n-Nikah, the Siratu'l-mustakim and a complimentary letter to the Raja of Kedah on the establishment of Islam in that country: so the \"Kedah Annals\" tell us.\n\nPossibly some of the historical detail given in this passage has been added by a later hand.\n\nMr. R. J. Wilkinson printed 2 vols. of the Bustanu's-Salatin (American Mission Press, Singapore, 1900), but most unfortunately his MS. was lost before the rest, which contains the chapters on\npeninsular Malay history, could be printed. Another MS. of the work, complete or incomplete I cannot say, No. 207 in the Logan Library, I have failed to trace. Codex 1971 and Codex 5303 of Leyden University Library (CCXVII in Juynboll's 'Catalogue' p. 216) and a MS. in the Library of the Royal Asiatic Society apparently contain the passage here printed. It is greatly to be hoped that Mr. Wilkinson's MS. or the Logan MS. or some other complete copy of this most scholarly book may yet be unearthed in the Peninsula and the remainder printed. That here and there a rare MS. copy of the book does exist is certain. Of Mr. Barnes' texts I have found only this Romanized extract: the original MSS. he used I have been unable to trace.\n\nStudents of history should consult in studying this extract the brilliant paper by Dr. Raden Husain Jayadiningrat on the \"Soel-tanaat van Atjeh\" in Bijd.

On the Embryo, Seedling and Position of the Flowers in various Species.\n\nBy I. H. Burkill.\n\nThis note deals, with the shape of the mature embryo, and with the characters of the seedling in a small number of species of the order Dipterocarpaceae: it deals also in a lesser measure with the position which the flowers assume when open. The observations were made and are recorded because it is believed that by a full knowledge of the morphology of the young plant, light will be cast upon the tangle which the genera of the order now present. In a lesser measure the position of the flower may possibly assist; and at any rate information concerning it is worth collecting.\n\nMost of the facts in this note were got together by visits to Penang in the months of July, October and December, 1918: such as were not, are enumerated in the footnote* below. It happened that the year, 1918, was unusually favourable to the Dipterocarps in Penang, where almost every local species flowered: and there Mr. Mohamed Haniff, of the Waterfall Gardens, observed and collected for me between my visits. To him for very much assistance, I tender my best thanks. I tender my best thanks, also, to Dr. F. W. Foxworthy, Mr. W. E. Kinsey and other Forest Officers for supplies of fresh seed from several parts of the Peninsula, which seed was put into cultivation in the Botanic Gardens, Singapore. No cultivation, however, returned the equivalent of days spent in the forests when the seeds were falling and germinating under natural conditions; for the seedling is so exacting in its demands that without experimenting on a very large scale cultivation often fails to supply adequate material.\n\nThe forest is undoubtedly the place in which to study the Dipterocarps. The earlier investigators were not able to realise that fully, not even collectively, and have left much to be done. The first of the workers worked, perforce, in European institutions remote from tropical nature, with material preserved by drying and chiefly collected by others. They constructed such classifi-\n\nThe following list gives the names of the plants which were not studied in Penang, but in Singapore:\n\nShorea gratissima Dyer, S. leprosula Miq., Balanocarpus Zcilanjbus Thw., and Pachynocarpus Wallichii, King species wild or long established in the Botanic Gardens, Singapore.

Soc., No. 81, 1920.\ncations as they could with what they had. Bentham for instance in Bentham and Hooker's *Genera Plantarum*, i, (1862) p. 190, after saying that the calyx in fruit gives the best key, presented an alternative on the structure of the flower; and Alphonse de Candolle in his *Prodromus*, xvi, part 2, (1868) p. 604 took a different line in classifying by the number of stamens. Heim, much later (*Recherches sur les Dipterocarpac\u00e9es, Introduction \u00e0 la Monographie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la Famille*, Paris, 1892, p. 14), when essaying to throw light upon the order by means of the microscopic structure, wrote \"the shape of the embryo is very variable, according to the genera,\u2014and this shape, wrongly neglected by writers, may furnish generic characters of the highest importance:\" But Brandis in the *Journal of the Linnear Society, Botany*, xxxi, 1895, p. 15, refused to allow importance to it, stating that the variability is great even among species otherwise closely allied. I am with Heim in thinking that there is a promise of utility in the study of the embryo.\n\nBrandis' effort is the last that has been made at classifying comprehensively the Dipterocarps of the World. He had long been an Indian Forest Officer: but he did it as herbarium work, his field knowledge of the order remaining limited to the relatively small number of species found in India. Few will regard the result as satisfying our need.\n\nUpon the botanists who live where Dipterocarps grow, now rests the duty of collecting such details regarding them as the Herbarium botanists have not had in full measure, and among the details, as Heim has pointed out, are the structure of the embryo and appearance of the seedling. Trimen, indeed, made some observations on the structure of the embryo of the Ceylon Dipterocarps (*Handbook of the Flora of Ceylon*, i, 1893, pp. 112-138 and his plates 13-15), but not comparatively between the species; and Pierre in his beautiful *Flore Foresti\u00e8re de la Cochin-Chine*, Paris, 1888, plates 212-259, figured many embryos, but unfortunately nearly always in a slightly immature state. I find consequently in his plates indications rather than facts, and trust that some day soon there may appear a botanist in Indo-China who will delineate the seedlings and mature embryos of the Dipterocarps which make so large a part of the forests there.\n\nSix ovules occupy in pairs the three chambers of the ovary of any one of the Dipterocarps. Out of the six except in cases which are rare, and of which a few have been recorded, one only develops into a seed. Brandis who in 1895 drew together the observations of earlier writers on the order, was able to cite but three species in which twin seeds had been found, namely *Dipterocarpus condorensis*, Pierre, *Dipterocarpus alatus*, Roxb., and *Dryobalanops aromatica*, Gaertn. f. (Engler's *Pflanzenfamilien*, iii, part 6, p. 251). To these Mr. B. Sen-Gupta (*Indian Forester*, xliv, 1918, p. 373) adds *Shorea robusta*, Roxb., with the remark that twin seeds are not infrequent.\nI have now to add several more; and it seems as if any few thousand seeds of a species may be expected to give an instance or two. The species which I have to add are:\u2014Dipterocarpus cor-nutus, Dyer, Dipterocarpus alatus of Penang (? Roxb.), Anisoptera Curtisi, King, Shorea macroptera, Dyer, Shorea pauciflora, Dyer, Shorea gratissima, Dyer, Shorea parviflora, Dyer, Retinodendron pallidum, King, and Pachynocarpus Wallichii, King.\n\nWhen two seeds are formed in the limited space of the one ovary, they interfere with each other in a way which will be described.\n\nThe single normal seed is produced with its radicle towards the apex of the ovary cavity, and with one cotyledon against the placenta. The placenta with the sterile loculi behind it persists, in most genera distinctly, as a chord to the curve of the ovary wall, while the embryo in growth laps round it. Thus the placentar cotyledon becomes doubled on itself backward over the placenta, and acquires a groove which, because the placenta remains firmly attached to the middle of the base of the ovary, in most genera leads to the embryo appearing with a seam down one side ending in an umbilicus. The other cotyledon becomes doubled ventrally onto the placentar cotyledon, and may shut the placentar cotyledon from the apex of the fruit-chamber. The embryo consequently acquires an obliquity which varies in the different species studied, and will be described with figures to indicate its degree.\n\nBut occasionally the embryo comes through its development without folding itself over the placenta. Instances have been found in the genera Dipterocarpus, Shorea and Retinodendron, which will be described. In them there is some indication of a spiral growth which throws the cotyledons into an S. The causes of it have not been ascertained; but Dipterocarpus where the placenta is least in evidence in the mature fruit, is the genus yielding instances most readily.\n\n**Dipterocarpus.**\n\nThe flower of *Dipterocarpus* usually, it seems, faces earthwards; and after flowering is done, the growing fruit maintains the position: it is as in figures 1 and 2.\n\n---\n\n**Figure 1.** Fruit of *Dipterocarpus alatus*, and figure 2, fruit of *D. fagineus*; both in vertical section with the embryo shaded. The arrow on figure 1, indicates the position at which a very common weevil emerges when its grub has completed the devouring of the seed and has passed through a period of pupation.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 81, 1920.\nWhen the fruit is ripe it falls as a shuttle-cock to the floor of the forest and there without delay germinates. The embryo, at fruit-fall, and if normal, is as in figures 3 and 4, the placentar cotyledon being enwrapped more or less completely by the other, the radicle extruding slightly from the basal lobes that the cotyledons possess, or just covered by them.\n\nFigures 3, an embryo of *Dipterocarpus cornutus* from the placentar side and 4, from the back. In figure 3 the edges of both the cotyledons are seen; in figure 4 a fold is seen in the upper part of the outer cotyledon.

Figure 14 is of a commoner condition. In it the placentar cotyledon (at the level of the section, which is at one third from the apices of the cotyledons) comes to the surface over about one fifth of the circumference. Figure 15, which is of a different species, shows it on the surface over one-third of the circumference.\n\nFigure 14, section of the embryo of *Dipterocarpus cornutus* showing the placentar cotyledon at the surface over one-fifth of the circumference, and the outer cotyledon with three folds at the back; figure 15, section of the embryo of *Dipterocarpus alatus*, of Penang with the placentar cotyledon at the surface over one-third of the circumference.\n\nFigures 16, 17 and 18 represent sections through the embryo of a new *Dipterocarpus* from Selangor, with rather small fruits. The placentar cotyledon is folded inside as described above. But figures 19, 20 and 21 show in the same species, the different folding mentioned above as resulting in the cotyledons being curved into an S., where neither is inside the other.\n\nS.-folding was observed in *Dipterocarpus fagineus*, Vesque, *D. alatus* of Penang, *D. cornutus*, Dyer, and this new species.\n\nFigures 16\u201421, section through two embryos of *Dipterocarpus*, n.sp.\n\nFigs.19\u201421, showing on the right the usual folding, Figs. 16\u201418, on the left a folding into the letter S.\n\nThe embryo of *Dipterocarpus fagineus* was found folded as in figures 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, and 27, and the embryo of *Dipterocarpus cornutus* as in figures 28, 29 and 30, a very similar arrangement to that seen in figures 19, 20 and 21.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 81, 1920.\nIt seems worthy of notice that in the folding of the cotyledons in the largest fruited of these three an extra curve is called into being (figure 28) indicated only just in the smaller embryo of *Dipterocarpus fagineus* (figure 22).\n\nTwin seeds in *Dipterocarpus cornutus* exhibited an S-folding. Did it result from the intensified and abnormal pressure from competition within the ovary? It became complicated by extra folds.\n\nThe apices of the cotyledons in the genus *Dipterocarpus* not uncommonly abut against a small lump of resin which acts as ballast when the fruits fall.\nAfter reaching the ground the radicle is extruded from the apex of the fruit without any well defined cracks spreading down the fruit wall; it is thrust out by the elongation of the petioles of the cotyledons as figures 34, 35, 36 and 37 indicate, and growing, exhausts the cotyledons of the nutriment stored in them, without the development in them of any visible change. They do not part in any way nor develop chlorophyll. Why has the genus *Dipterocarpus* thin cotyledons, so much broader and more leaf-like than is usual in the order, without any function attached that belongs to the thinness of leaves? Their elaborate folding is a consequence of their size. Their surfaces which are morphologically upper surfaces are very uneven. Why? They fit so tightly together, that slipping over each other would seem impossible; but the morphologically lower surfaces are smooth, as the drawings indicate, and obviously one part slides over another in growth.\n\n**Figures 34-37, Seedlings of:\u2014**\n\n(34) *Dipterocarpus Scorutchinii*\n\n(35) *D. crinitus*\n\n(36) *D.

Then again Correa de Serra in the *M\u00e9moires du Mus\u00e9um d'Histoire Naturelle*, i, 1815, p. 159 and Colebrooke in the *Asiatick Researches*, iii, 1816, figured it; later others. But apparently the actual germination has not been described, though the dehiscence of the fruit has been recorded as along three defined lines, and abundantly commented on.\n\nFigure 38 is of the young seedling seen from the side, and figure 39 of its cotyledons seen from above. The larger of these cotyledons is slightly cup-shaped when expanded, the other slightly humped; and they come to stand horizontally. Their upper surface is as rough as that of a *Dipterocarpus*, but their cells are full of chlorophyll.\n\nFigures 38 and 39, the seedling of *Dryobalanops aromatica* from the side and from above, showing how the cotyledons expand, how unequal they are, and how uneven is their surface; nat size.\n\nFigure 40 is a section down the germinating fruit showing the radicle extruding and curving earthwards. It shows also the extraordinary invagination of the placenta, of which the genesis is unstudied, and the function if any, quite obscure. This invagination is like an apron in shape; round its edges at either side curves the dorsal cotyledon embracing with it the inner or placentar cotyledon.\nFigure 42, the germinating fruit of *Dryobalanops aromatica* in vertical median section, showing cal. = a calyx lobe; f. w. = fruit wall; pl. = placenta; i. cot. inner or placentar cotyledon; o. cot. = outer cotylepon, cut in three places.

This section shows that the cotyledons are rather thin and that the outer goes far towards enveloping the inner.

It is a common small tree of some parts of Penang island.\n\nAs in the genus *Dipterocarpus*, the flowers face earthwards; but they are small, and illustrate the statement that greater size and downward direction in anthesis do not accompany each other through the order. They are claret in colour, with petals but little twisted.\n\nFigure 56, a flower of *Balanocarpus Curtisi* in vertical section, \u00d7 4.\n\nFigure 57, a flower seen from below, \u00d7 4.\n\nFigure 58, a young fruit in vertical section, \u00d7 4.\n\nFrom the nearly globose fruit a wiry seedling arises, with a pair of leaves and with alternate leaves following them approximat-\ned to the pair, the first of the approximated alternate leaves being almost in a false whorl with the pair.\n\nThe cotyledons are very like those of *Hopea micrantha*\u2014rather thin and nearly vertical in position; but the margin of the outer has a rather characteristic rim surrounding plano-convex areas. Red pigment is present in them and in the leaves which follow them.\n\n**Figure 59**, the seedling of *Balanocarpus Curtisi*, showing the approximation of the third (3) and fourth (4) leaves to the paired leaves, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) nat. size.\n\n**Figure 60**, the outer cotyledon of *Balanocarpus Curtisi* seen from the outside; figure 61, from the inside. figure 62, the placentar cotyledon seen from the side against the outer cotyledon, figure 63, from the other side nat., size; figures 64 and 65, the position taken by the cotyledons with regard to each other.\n\n*Balanocarpus zeylanicus*, Trim., a species cultivated in the Botanic Gardens, Singapore, has flowers directed earthwards, from ascending branchlets as in figure 66.

In it the placentar cotyledon is rolled rather than folded, and the outer cotyledon embraces it (vide figure 75). The placentar cotyledon is horned as figures 76, 79 and 80 show. The revolution of the placentar cotyledon suggests *Dipterocarpus*.\n\nFigure 75, the embryo of *Vatica nitens* with the radicle away from the observer.\n\nFigure 76, the young seedling of *Vatica nitens* with the placentar cotyledon towards the observer; figure 77, the outer cotyledon from the outside; figure 78, from the inside; figure 79, the placentar cotyledon from the side toward the outer cotyledon and figure 80, from the other side, \u00bd nat. size.\n\nRed pigment is plentifully present in the cotyledons.

That change is of course immaterial to the structure under examination. Figure 82 is an embryo viewed with the radicle away from the observer. The placentar cotyledon is folded rather than revolute. When the seedling develops, the placentar cotyledon is seen to possess one marked horn, and one scarcely defined. So far these horns have been found in *Vatica* and *Retinodendron* alone.\n\nFigure 81, the fruit of *Retinodendron pallidum* germinating; \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) nat. size; fig. 82, the embryo seen with the radicle away from the observer; fig. 83, a section of the embryo through the lobes of the cotyledons and the radicle; figure 84, twin embryos seen with the radicles away from the observer; figure 85, the smaller of these.\n\nFigure 86, seedling of *Retinodendron pallidum*; figure 87, its outer cotyledon from outside; figure 88, from inside; figure 89, the inner cotyledon from the side towards the outer cotyledon; figure 90, from the other side; all \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) nat. size.\n\nFigure 91, Seedling of *Retinodendron pallidum* showing the ultimate position of the cotyledons: rather more than \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) nat. size.\n\nFigure 92, the outer cotyledon of *Retinodendron pallidum* from outside; figure 93, from inside; figure 94, the placentar cotyledon from the side towards the outer cotyledon; figure 95, from the other side. \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) nat. size.\n\nJour. Straits Branch\nRetinodendron cotyledons an claret in colour. Figures 84 and 85 present a case of twin seeds. Apparently they arose from the ovules of one loculus for the placentar cotyledon of the seed represented above is turned away from the seed represented below; this cotyledon is folded normally; but under the unusual pressure the outer cotyledon has taken on an S-curvature such as has been recorded for the genus Dipterocarpus. The cotyledons of the lesser seed are packed in an X-form each partly above and partly below. The better to show this they have been drawn in figure 85 slightly apart. Figure 96 shows the cotyledons of another abnormal seed wherein there had been a similar packing of the lobes: two such cases were observed.\n\nFigure 96, cotyledons of an abnormal seedling of Retinodendron pallidum in which each had been packed partly above and partly below the other, \u00bd nat. size.\n\nAnisoptera.\n\nThe embryo and seedling of Anisoptera costata were described in this Journal No. 75, 1917, pp. 43-48. The observations here to be recorded were made upon another species, A. Curtisii, King, frequent in Penang island. Figure 97 is its embryo seen with the radicle away from the observer. Figures 98, 99 and 100 are successive stages in its germination. Figure 101 is a seedling with its false whorl of four leaves. These four leaves obviously represent a pair with two others drawn into a whorl with them; the condition is the limit of approximation of the leaves which follow the pair as in Dryobalanops aromatica and the Hopeas of the section Dryobalanoides. But so thoroughly have these following leaves been incorporated into a whorl with the pair that they are not recognisable constantly by size and one of them quite commonly exceeds in its length one of the leaves of the pair. To this state I called attention in describing the seedling of Anisoptera costata, without then having the key to the origin as given by the examination of the germination of Dryobalanops and Hopea.\n\nR.

The genesis of the ridges of the placentar cotyledon will be observed also, the grooves which separate them being creases arising in the curling of the thick cotyledon. The outer cotyledon through life remains the smaller (vide figure 102), and its petiole is about 1 mm. shorter.\n\nFigure 103 and 104, the embryos of two fruits with twin seeds; the placentar cotyledon is the inner in both cases and is not curved. The ovules which gave rise to the seeds were of different loculi.\n\nFigure 105, a vertical section through a fruit of *Anisoptera Curtisii* with twin seeds in separate loculi, with the placenta between them and showing its curious process into the seeds, nat. size.\n\nIn *Anisoptera Curtisii* I found twin seeds to be frequent; figures 103, 104 and 105 illustrate them. When twins were present they were as far as seen in different loculi. Then the placentar cotyledon would be unfolded as the drawings show. Into it a process of placentar tissue runs, which gelatinises at the maturity of the seed, and seems to be homologous with the apron like process described above as found in *Dryobalanops*.\n\nThe seedlings of *Anisoptera costata* and *A. Curtisii* do not develop in their tissues red pigment.\n\n**Balanocarpus section Richetia.**\n\n*Balanocarpus penangianus*, King, is a very common tree on the hills of the Island of Penang; and in 1918 it fruited very freely. The fruit is as drawn in figure 106. Its radicle commences to protrude before any distinct cracks spread down the fruit wall. Figure 110 is the embryo, seen with the radicle remote from the observer, and figures 107, 108 and 109 are sections through it at different levels.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 81, 1920.\nFigure 106, fruit of *Balanocarpus penangianus*, germinating, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) nat. size; figure 107, section through the embryo showing the radicle central between the equal lobes of the cotyledons; figure 108, section at the middle showing the lobes of the placentar cotyledon at this level rather smaller than those of the outer cotyledon; figure 109, section through the plumule showing the placentar cotyledon here the smaller.\n\nThe cotyledons are of a deep red, nearly equal, and stand parallel on short petioles as drawn (figure 111). A pair of bright green leaves follow them having remarkably long acuminations: so long are these acuminations that when the leaf is just expanding they make one-half of its length, and at maturity one-third. The stem is wiry.\n\nNo Malayan Dipterocarp has been observed with a more easily recognised seedling than has *Balanocarpus penangianus*.\n\n**Hopea**, section **Euhopea**.\n\n*Hopea Curtisi*, King, has a seedling in many respects like that of some species in the genus *Shorea*. The fruit is globose as figure 113 indicates. The naked embryo seen with the radicle remote from the observer is as in figure 114, or germinating with the placentar cotyledon towards the observer as in figure 115.\n\nFigure 113, A fruit of *Hopea Curtisi*, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) Nat. size; figure 114, an embryo with the radicle away from the observer, and figure 115, germinating, with the placentar cotyledon, towards the observer, \\( \\times 1 \\).\n\nThe outer cotyledon is considerably larger than the placentar cotyledon and alone reaches the apex of the ovary; figures 117, 118-119 and 120 show by how much it is the larger. The cotyledons are of an orange-claret colour. They become horizontal in the seedling: and a pair of leaves follow them.\nTwice cotyledons, folded into an S, were found.\n\nFigure 116, a seedling of Hopea Curtisi, \u00bd nat. size; figure 117, its outer cotyledon from outside; figure 118, from inside; figure 119, the placentar cotyledon from the side towards the outer cotyledon; and figure 120, from the other side, all \u00bd nat. size.\n\nThe attention of the reader may be called to faint grooves on the surface of the cotyledons, which are due to raised lines in the fruit wall. The splitting of the fruit wall as the seed germinates is between these raised lines, or may rarely cross one or two of them, not being along any definite line of dehiscence, but apparently along any weak line upon which the cotyledons in their effort to flatten themselves press most. Therefore that the fruit of such Dipterocarps as Vatica, should usually free its seedling by splits along three lines is not to be assumed as connected with the trilocular nature of the ovary in the order, unless and until microscopic examination of successive stages in the development of the fruit has shown it to be so. Retinodendron frequently splits into two only; and in Shorea sericea, two and four splittings were found not infrequently.\n\nShorea.\n\nShorea in several species exhibits grooves on the embryo such as those to which attention has just been called under Hopea Curtisi. They are particularly obvious in Shorea costata, King.\n\nFigure 121 is its embryo with the radicle remote from the observer, and 122 is the same from the side with the placentar cotyledon towards the observer. As in Hopea Curtisi the outer cotyledon is the larger and shuts the placentar cotyledon out from the apex of the ovary.\n\nFigure 121, the embryo of Shorea costata with the radicle away from the observer; figure 122, the same with the placentar cotyledon towards the observer, \u00bd nat. size.\n\nR.

The placental cotyledon does not attain the apex of the fruit cavity, but approaches it more nearly that in *S. costata* and *S. materialis*. Both cotyledons are grooved by ridges of the fruit-wall. A pair of leaves follows the cotyledons, and these, as well as those which follow, possess a peculiar blue green tint which has not been seen in any other species of the order.\n\nThere was no chlorophyll in the cotyledons at seed-fall: all other *Shorea* examined possess it.\n\nFigure 128, embryo of *Shorea gratissima* with the placental cotyledon towards the observer; figure 129, the same with the radicle away from the observer, and also in section through the bodies of the cotyledons above the plumule, showing the folds of the placental cotyledon.

All \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) nat. size.\nShorea pauciflora, Dyer, has a large fruit very like that of S. costata, but a trifle greater in length. The embryo seen with the radicle away from the observer is drawn in figure 135. The seedling produced is relatively large, so that with practise it can be detected by eye among the seedlings of other species. The cotyledons are as figured below (figures 136, 137, 138 and 139). The groove in which the placenta lies is not quite so narrow as in some other Shoreas.\n\nFigure 135, embryo of Shorea pauciflora with the radicle away from the observer; figure 136, the cotyledons of Shorea pauciflora; figure 137, the outer cotyledon from the outside; figure 138, from the inside; figure 139, the placentar cotyledon from the side toward the outer cotyledon; figure 140, from the other side.

The fruit is rather short (figure 143) and the embryo has its placentar cotyledon only just shut off from the apex of the fruit cavity.\nFigure 142, the fruit of *Shorea utilis* with its wings; \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) nat. size; and figure 143 without; figure 144, the embryo with the radicle away from the observer; figure 145, the outer cotyledon from the outside; figure 146, from the inside; figure 147, the placentar cotyledon from the side towards the outer; and figure 148, from the other side.

The seedling is small in comparison with that of other Shoreas.\n\nTwin seeds were found.\n\nShorea scutulata, King, has a capsule slightly elongated, the outer cotyledon just shutting the placental cotyledon out from the apex of the fruit-cavity: these cotyledons appear almost equal after germination.\n\nFigure 155, seedling of Shorea sentilata, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) nat. size.\n\nIllustrations of Shorea Curtisi, King, follow. It is a species very common on the hills of Penang and rather variable in the shape and size of the fruit as well as in the length and breadth of the calyx-wings, so much so that ultimately several varieties are likely to be distinguished, the fruits of two of which are figured here (figures 165 and 170). Both are represented among the specimens cited by Sir George King in describing the species, so that both are his Shorea Curtisi.\n\nFigure 165, fruit of a variety of Shorea Curtisi, with long wings: figure 166, normal embryo of the same with the placental cotyledon, x-x, towards the observer; figures 167 and 168, abnormal embryos in which the placenta (dotted line) did not occupy the cleft between the lobes of the placental cotyledon in a normal way; figure 169, an abnormal embryo with one lobe of the placental cotyledon small.

Soc., No. 81. 1920.\nThe normal cotyledons are not markedly unequal: the outer occupies rather more than one half of the circumference of the embryo as seen with the radicle away from the observer, and just shuts out the placentar cotyledon from the apex of the fruit: but occasionally it may much outgrow it. For cases of nearly equal cotyledons see figures 171-179.\n\nFigure 171, an embryo of the variety of *Shorea Curtisi* figured above as 165, viewed with the radicle away from the observer; figure 172, the outer cotyledon from outside; and figure 173, the inner cotyledon from the face away from the outer cotyledon; figure 174, the naked embryo of the variety drawn above as figure 170, viewed with the radicle away from the observer; and figure 175, the outer cotyledon of the same from outside; and figure 176, the inner cotyledon from the side away from the outer cotyledon; figure 177, a naked embryo of the same variety as figure 170 viewed with the radicle away from the observer; and figure 178, the outer cotyledon from outside; and figure 179, the inner cotyledon from the side away from the outer cotyledon. All \u00bd nat. size.\n\nFigures 180 to 185, outlines of the cotyledons of three seedlings of *Shorea Curtisi* showing varying degrees of disparity between the cotyledons, the outer cotyledon is the upper of each pair. All \u00bd nat. size.\n\nFour cases are shown in figures 167 and 168 in which the placentar cotyledon failed to lie against the placenta in a normal way but had, as it were, got across it, so that the placenta had left a shallow impression upon the face of the cotyledon,\u2014a slight groove like the grooves seen in *Shorea costata*, and the result of pressure. These abnormalities were not accompanied by the presence of any twin seed. Again an abnormality is figured in figure 169 in which the lobes of the cotyledons had grown unequally.\n\nPerhaps because I have found so many more thousands of its seeds and seedlings on the hills of Penang than of other Shoreas, I have found such abnormalities in it only.\nThe next Shorea to be illustrated is *Shorea sericea*, Dyer. Like *Shorea rigida*, Brandis, from which as a species it is doubtfully distinct, it has nearly equal cotyledons, the outer only just the larger, of the same shape as those of *Shorea rigida* (vide this Journal No. 76, 1917, p. 164). One case of a seedling with three nearly equal cotyledons was found in Penang.\n\n![Figure 186](image)\n\n**Figure 186**, the fruit of *Shorea sericea* germinating, \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\) nat. size; figure 187 a seedling with its cotyledons in the position that they assume, slightly reduced\n\n![Figure 188](image)\n\n**Figure 188**, an embryo of *Shorea sericea* seen with the radicle away from the observer; figure 189, the outer cotyledon seen from the outer side; and figure 190, the inner cotyledon seen from the side away from the outer cotyledon.

Other species illustrated above have thick cotyledons: they have been arranged into a series commencing with those having cotyledons markedly unequal, and ending with those having cotyledons equal. *S. bracteolata* does not fit into the series, but like *S. leprosula* has flat cotyledons. Attention was called to them in this Journal No. 76, 1917, p. 164, where the cotyledons of *S. leprosula* were described. Unlike *S. leprosula* it has a large flower directed earthwards.\n\nR. A.

Figure 12 on p. 165 of this Journal No. 76, 1917, suggests this, but is not good for its purpose.\n\nFigure 193, a seedling of *Shorea bracteolata*, showing the position taken by the cotyledons; figure 194, the outer cotyledon from the outside; figure 195; the same from the inner side; figure 196, the placentar cotyledon from the side toward the outer cotyledon; and figure 197, the same from the other side, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) nat. size.\n\nFigures 198 to 201, the cotyledon of an abnormal seed of *Shorea bracteolata*; figure 198, the outer cotyledon from the outside; figure 199, the same from inside; figure 200, the placentar cotyledon from the side toward the outer cotyledon; and figure 201, the same from the other side, Nat. size.\n\nJour.

Curtisii* possess it also in the leaves which follow while they are quite young.\n\n**Pachynocarpus.**\n\nIn many points the genus *Pachynocarpus* is unlike the other Dipterocarps here under discussion, and in none more so than that the fruits appear fitted for distribution by water. They, in *Pachynocarpus Wallichii*, are nearly globose, and the calyx is no larger than it was in the flower. The flower is drawn in figures 204 and 205 and the fruit just germinating in figure 206. Thirty-four fruits of the species were collected in the Botanic Garden, Singapore, in November, 1918 and kept in water with the intention of ascertaining how long they would float. The first to sink had floated only five days, the second ten days, but the rest floated various periods from ten to forty-six days; and the average of the thirty-four was twenty-two days. They germinated as they sank, the stalks of\nthe cotyledons pushing out a stout plantlet, which rather slowly produced its first foliage leaves. The cotyledons do not escape from the seed: for the purpose of drawing them they were freed as in figure 209: they are thick and approximately equal, dull yellow in colour, packed with starch, and without chlorophyll. The seedling does not look like that of a Dipterocarp. The fruit dehisces along three well defined lines obviously connected with the tri-locular nature of the ovary. The placenta leaves but a shallow impression down the placentar cotyledon.\n\nFigure 206, the flower of *Pachynocarpus Wallichii* from the side; figure 207, the same in section.\n\nFigure 208, the germinating fruit of *Pachynocarpus Wallichii*, the radicle just extruded.\n\nFigure 209, a! seedling of *Pachynocarpus Wallichii*, the fruit wall has been removed, on doing which the cotyledons part a little in consequence of stresses in their petioles, \u00bd nat.size; figure 210, the embryo of *Pachynocarpus Wallichii* with the radicle away from the observer; figure 211, the cotyledon which is the outer in *Dipterocarpus* from the outside; figure 212, the placentar cotyledon with the side away from the other cotyledon toward the observer.\nAddenda et Corrigenda.\n\nWe were unable to correct the proofs of the first part of this paper, published in Journal, No. 80, May 1919, and the following additions and alterations are necessary:\n\nMap for Heloetia read Helvetia\n,, ,, Toerra ,, Toewa\np. 76 line 22 ,, capellei ,, capelli\n78 ,, 6 ,, Talaman ,, Talamau\n85 ,, 24 ,, Mentinting ,, Meninting\n86 ,, 34-5 insert between \"from the Malay Peninsula and as the above wing measure.\"\n,, ,, 36 delete whole line.\n90 ,, 34 for Macropteryae read Macropteryx\n,, ,, 41 ,, longipennis ,, comata\n92 ,, 27 ,, pravaata ,, pravata\n95 ,, 4 delete whole line.\n97 ,, 29 for Talaman ,, Talamau\n103 ,, 21 ,, Nomenclature\n,, ,, 26 insert in blank spaces: > >\n107 footnote for 1919 read 1909\n110 line 42 delete whole line.\n111 ,, 34 Though A. p. phaeocephalus (Harll) is recorded from Borneo, birds with yellow-tipped tails A. p. diardi (Temm. in Finsch) seem prevalent there and it is possible that this form entirely replaces the typical one.\n\np. 112 line 26 for portea read postea\n,, ,, ,, 61 ,, 133\n113 ,, 8 delete parentheses.\n116 footnote for H.

BODEN KLOSS, F.Z.S., M.B.O.U.\n\nPART II.\n\nSince the publication of the first part of this paper (antea pp. 74-133), we have been favoured with a further series of birds by Heer A. C. F. A. van Heyst which, containing as it does, a considerable number of species not included in his former consignments, merits description in detail. In addition we have received a copy of a paper by Dr. L. F. de Beaufort and Dr. L. P. de Bussy \"Vogels van de Oostkust van Sumatra\" (Bijdragen tot de Dierkunde uitgegeven door het Koninglijk Zoologisch Genootschap \"Naturis Artis Magistra\" te Amsterdam, xxi, pp. 229 to 276 (1918?) which deals with a large collection of birds made in precisely the same localities as that of Heer van Heyst. We have quoted this article throughout as \"de Beaufort and de Bussy p.\u2014.\"\n\nAs the area covered by the political division known as the Sumatran East Coast Residency has now been explored in some detail, at least as regards its ornithology, we have indicated briefly the total number of species definitely known to occur in the area to which no great additions, except Limicoline, coastal and migrant forms are now to be expected, with the possible exception of such species as thrushes, warblers and white-eyes which may perhaps be found on the summits of the highest mountains above 5,000 feet which have not yet been dealt with.\n\nWe have throughout, where necessary, quoted the first part of this paper as \"antea p. .\"\n\nTwo new forms Pycnonotus bimaculatus barat, inhabiting West Java and the whole of the upland areas of Sumatra and Cryptolopha montis inornata, known as yet only from the Battak Highlands are here described and a new name Tephrodornis pelvica fretensis given to the Wood Shrike inhabiting Eastern Sumatra and the Southern Malay Peninsula, while the additions listed raise the number of definitely recorded Sumatran species to 548.\n\nHeer van Heyst has forwarded us the following additional account of the type of country collected over.\n\n\"The district of Deli can be subdivided into\n\n(i). Low land up to about 100 m. (225 feet), once covered with sea.\n\n(ii). Hill land from 100-400 m. (325-1,300 feet).\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 81, 1920.\n(iii). Mountain land from 450-2,000 m. (1,460-6,500 feet).\n\n(iv). The Karo Tableland.\n\nUnder (i) which is bordered on its seaward face by bakau (mangrove) forests fall the collecting stations Polonia, Mabar and Tanjong Morawa. They are tobacco estates, mainly fallow land, covered with young scrub and lalang grass. One eighth of an estate is planted per annum and after that lies fallow for seven years. Along the Batang Koewis (Tanjong Morawa), the boundary river between Deli and Serdang, is a strip of old jungle, where a number of birds were collected as also in the kampongs (villages) along the river. In various places are swamps. Characteristic of the district are tall tualang trees (*Koompassia* sp.).\n\n(ii). Hill land up to about 200 m. (650 feet) which is almost the limit of tobacco cultivation, is mostly without forest. Above that level the terrain has been largely felled by Battaks but there are still patches of big forest; the country is also characterised by steep ravines and slopes. In this region are the collecting stations, Deli Toewa, Toentoengan and Gambir.\n\n(iii). On the south side at about 700 m. (2,275 feet) begins old forest which stretches across the chain of the Karo Mts. (2,000 mm, 6,500 feet) to the Karo Tableland. On the north side lies Bandar Baroe, on the Medan-Toba road at the foot of Mt. Sibajak, at the entrance to the Tengkeh Pass. Birds collected there come from the north slopes of Mt. Sibajak, at a height of 1,000-1,400 m. (3,250-4,550 feet). At the highest point of the pass is Tengkeh (1,430 m.) (4,650) with magnificent high old forest.\n\n(iv). Karo Tableland is covered with lalang grass and surrounded by mountains often 1500 m. (4875 feet) in height. Trees are to be found in deep ravines and in the native villages. On the tableland is also occasional Battak cultivation. On the north side lies Brastagi. Birds from that locality were collected on the southern slopes of the Karo Mts., on the tableland itself, and in the villages.\u201d\n\nIn addition to those obtained by Heer van Heyst the following species appear in the list published by Messrs. de Beaufort and de Bussy regarding which the following notes may be of interest. The numbers prefixed are those of the authors, appended ones are from our own list. (Journ. Fed. Malay States Mus.

To these must be added 22 species from Dr. Hartert\u2019s list, 6 from Salvadori\u2019s list, 7 from Parrot\u2019s list and Pitta schneideri, making a total of 379 species definitely recorded from the administrative division of Sumatra\u2019s East Coast.\n\nAnalysis of the collection which covers a range in altitude of from sea level to about 1500 m. (= 5,000 feet approximately) indicates that as regards the montane fauna that of Sumatra is very homogeneous, the only group missing in the present collection being the Javanese element which occurs at higher levels in the mountains of the West Coast comprising species such as Turdus indrapurae, Cettia sumatrana, Notodela diana sumatrana, Zosterops montana, Pericrocotus miniatus and the forms of Cryptolopha allied to grammiceps, etc. We attach no importance to the absence of such genera as Rimator, and Turdinulus which are easily overlooked, the more so as an equally skulking form, Pnoepyga, is represented. Among the lowland forms certain essentially continental species occur, such as Geocichla citrina citrina, Otocompsa emeria, Chrysocolaptes guttacristatus and Upupa epops indica; while other races show a tendency to vary in the directions of Northern forms rather than towards the Javanese which, in view of the great length of the island, is not in the least surprising.\n\nPHASIANIDAE.\n\n1.

The former author also records Pyrotrogon vidua, hitherto only known from Borneo, also from the Deli District (Ornith. Monatsb. 16, 1908, p. 190). As these birds are merely representative forms of one species it is extremely improbable that they will both be found to occur in the same area though without seeing the latter specimen also it is impossible to say definitely that P. vidua does not occur in Sumatra.\n\n42.

Though Vieillot\u2019s original description had no locality attached (we have not ourselves been able to verify the reference) Kloss has already fixed the type locality as Java (Ibis, 1918, p. 105) and Mr. Stuart Baker is not at liberty to transfer it to Malacca.\n\n52. **Brachylophus puniceus observandus** (Hartert).

For the present it is sufficient to state that the Sumatran bird appears to be readily separable from all Malay Peninsula birds by its much darker colour throughout especially on the sides of the head and foreneck and by the much duller crown. In the Bornean bird the head is dark grey throughout. Such evidence as is on record goes to show that the species does not occur at all in Java, and that the type which is not apparently in existence is just as likely to have come from Malacca as from Singapore.\n\n103.

Belanger, 1834, p. 253 and is actually a synonym of Tephrodornis pondiceriana (Gm.), we used this name for the Malayan and East Sumatran birds which are intermediate between T. gularis of West Sumatra and T. p. annectens R. and K., of Peninsular Siam. We now propose that this race should be known as above.\n\nIt is a trifle smaller than T. p. annectens and greyer, the mantle being like the head, not earthy brown distinct from the cap. It differs from T. gularis in larger size, less blue-grey colour, earthy brown tail and wings, more ashy throat, breast and flanks, and in the absence of white on the forehead.\n\nType.

His name for the race is in any event a nomen nudum as a reference to the Museum Heineanum will show. The true origin of platurus Vieillot, is admittedly uncertain but we consider that the locality is fixed as Malacca and Sumatra by Tweeddale (Ibis 1877, p. 314) and we now further restrict it to Malacca sensu stricto. We possess considerable series of the Javan bird to which if distinct the name D. formosus, Cab. (Mus. Hein., i, p. 111, 1850) applies.\n\n123.

Sumatra, 28th November, 1918 [No. 1326].\n   Wing, \u2642, 67 mm.\n\nIt is with regret we must record that hypogrammica as the name of this species of sunbird must give way to macularia Blyth. Anthreptes macularia was founded on a female from Malacca and although Blyth a year later regarded this name as a nomen nudum and described a male from Singapore as Anthreptes nuchalis (Journ. Asiat. Soc. Bengal XII (1843) p. 980) yet the diagnosis attached \"allied in plumage to the Arachnotherae\" is perfectly adequate and his earlier name\nmust stand. Dr. Hartert was apparently ignorant of this when quite recently he restricted *hypogrammica* of Mueller to Sumatra and gave the name *intensor* to Bornean birds.\n\nThus the birds in each of the large Malaysian land masses have got names of their own:\n\n1. *Anthreptes macularia*. Blyth, Journ. Asiat. Soc. Bengal, XI (1842) p. 107. Malay Peninsula. [Settlement of Malacca].\n\n2. *Nectarinia hypogrammica*. Mueller, Naturl. Gesch. Land-en Volkenk (1843) p. 173. Sumatra.\n\n3. *Anthreptes hypogrammica intensor*. Hartert, Bull. Brit. Orn. Club, XXXVIII (1917) p. 27. Borneo [Balingean, Sarawak].\n\nWe, however, after comparison of the above specimen with a pair from Borneo, can find no difference between the birds of the two islands and must therefore regard *A. h. intensor* as not fully established.\n\nDifferences between the island birds and those of the Malay Peninsula are, in our opinion on the material available (and it should be noted that at present we have only four examples of the former though many of the latter) lacking, or so slight that we are not inclined to accept any distinction.

We find, however, that a series of seven Sumatran males which we have before us can be exactly matched out of a series of forty Malayan birds: and that the character of lightness or darkness of the throat is useless as each series exhibits a considerable amount of variation: neither does a single Bornean male differ from the darker-throated Malayan and Sumatran examples.\n\n142.

D. Gimlette.\n\nLast year Chief Inspector Jackson gave me a rudely fashioned belt which had been found by the Kelantan Police on the body of a Malay robber, stabbed to death in 1917, in the district of Bacho'. It was tied round the dead man's waist concealed in the folds of his sarong. I am indebted to Captain H. A., Anderson, the Chief Police Officer of Kelantan, for access to the case file. The history is briefly as follows. Enche' Mah binti Enche' Mun heard a noise about 1:30 a.m., on 26.5.1917, as if a robber was breaking through the wall of her house (orang buka buchu dinding). She was frightened and roused her husband Awang Tanda bin Salleh. He seized a spear and stabbed a man who was about to enter their bed room. The robber ran a short distance and fell dead; he was a Kelantan Malay unknown to anyone in the seaside district of Bacho' or to anyone in the village of Pauh where the tragedy occurred. Awang Tanda had stabbed him between the ribs.\n\nPhotograph (A), recently taken in Kota Baharu, shows the general appearance of the robber's belt before it was taken to pieces. It was a girdle made of two stout cords about four feet long, twisted together and knitted in the centre, to make a small pouch which seems to have originally contained a white stone. The pouch had been cut open before the belt came into my possession and was empty; the cord on either side of it was strengthened by an extra strand of twisted cord, to the extent of about five inches on each side. This part of the girdle was worn behind and a strip of orange coloured calico, such as that worn by Siamese priests, dyed by means of a decoction of the heart of the Jack-tree (Artocarpus integrifolia, Linn., Urticaceae), was twisted round this central part of the belt making a kind of bundle.\n\nInside this yellow bundle were a wild boar's tusk; a smooth, round, slate-coloured stone, about as large as a small coin (pitis); a tuft of hair (ch\u00e9mara babi) said to have come from the neck of a wild boar, and one small oval-shaped, dark-speckled stone. The pig's tusk was originally wrapped in the cloth, not projecting as shown in the photograph: both it and the other talismans were made secure by means of twine bound round the cloth wherever necessary. An outer covering of dirty white calico about five feet in length and half a foot in breadth, strengthened at regular intervals by means of bindings of string, was wrapped round the whole belt except for a length of cord, free on either side, to tie in front.\n\nA small fragment of bright metal, not heavy enough to be of value, and closely resembling on fracture a spur of copper pyrites, was found carefully wrapped in a scrap of plain white cloth, as\nPhotograph A.\nwell as a rough, oval, grey-coloured stone, which was protected in the same way. Both of these were found in the folds of the long strip of white cloth, the inner surface of which was covered from top to bottom with Siamese drawings, letters, and numerals. A reproduction, taken from a tracing of the original design, is shown in photograph (B). Although the belt (pakian) is described above as being rudely fashioned, both the inside yellow covering and the outside covering of white cloth were really very neatly twisted and strongly bound; the various talismans being secured by means of twine in the folds of the cloth, so implying that they must have been of value to the owner. Unfortunately two other stones or talismans had been cut out and stolen after the exhibit had been produced in Court and Awang Tanda acquitted.\n\nAt the time of the trial in 1917, the charm was described by the Kelantan Malay Police as an amulet connected with thieves, (azimat lazim di-pakai oleh penchuri-penchuri) and it is stated by them, to contain both batu guliga and batu ular as well as the tuft of hair from the pig. The mention of batu ular is of interest because batu ular is the stone that is supposed to be vomited by the snake and to possess luminous qualities. None of the stones that were found in the belt correspond however, in weight or size or colour with the usual conception of the bezoar stone, a calculus found sometimes inside small land animals, trees and more rarely in arachnida, (sic); they seem, by common consent, to be merely polished pebbles from a river bed. None of them give a yellow reaction to the native test for guliga by rubbing with lime (kapur).\n\nThe Police Magistrate, Tengku Hassan, (son-in-law to H. H. the Sultan of Kelantan), remarks in his notes that Kelantan yokels describe the charm as buntat, (petrified stones found in the bodies of animals supposed to contain, but not always, talismanic properties). One witness said that such a charm would protect the skin of the wearer from hurt or harm by any sort of weapon; that some think ch\u00e9mara babi to be very useful to burglars because it keeps people in a sound sleep, (sekot); while others say that ch\u00e9mara babi is invaluable because, if the wild pig should attempt to gore the wearer, it would not be able to wound him. The Magistrate ends his notes by remarking that many old men surmise that a charm of this nature will protect our skins; it will make people afraid of us and make us daring. Tengku Hassan writes in conclusion that he himself has never seen any information about a charm of this kind in any of the original Malay books on charms and medicines for charms.\n\nThe chief interest of this curious belt seems to centre on the hair of the wild pig (ch\u00e9mara babi). Superstitions about the wild boar (Sus cristatus), mentioned by Skeat in \"Malay Magic,\" p. 188, are fully believed in by the Kelantan people; they do not seem however to recognize the fable of the \"wild boar's chain\", but pin their faith on a kind of hair necklace which they say the boar is very particular about keeping clean. A lucky man may find it\nnear a jungle pig's wallow, when the beast has taken it off for the purpose of bathing. It is not necessarily searched for by bad people and worn only by criminals. I have recently had an opportunity of examining two of the ch\u00e9mara babi charms in Kota Baharu; they are identical in appearance and consist of small bundles of stiff, dark fibres, apparently obtained from a palm such as the palmyra or perhaps the coco-nut tree. About thirty fibres were tied together with cotton in one instance, forming a bundle about fifteen inches in length; this was enclosed in a small red bag made of cloth and valued at more than fifty dollars. It is essential that the ch\u00e9mara babi be obtained from a live boar and kept alive. It is kept alive by first washing it with b\u00e9luru, the stem of a very large, local liane used by Kelantan men and women for washing their hair, (Entada scandens, Linn., Leguminosae), and the juice of the lime fruit, (Citrus acida, Roxb., Rutaceae); then oiling with coco-nut oil and smoking for a few minutes with k\u00e9m\u00e9nnyan or benzoin, (Styrax benzoin). This is to be done every Thursday evening about the time of the hour of prayer; it should have the effect of making the ch\u00e9mara elastic and curly.\n\nThe tuft of hair hidden in the robber's belt and described by the police at the time as ch\u00e9mara babi is of quite a different character to the fibres described above. Even on casual inspection it appears from its black colour with reddish tinge, its fineness and lustre to be human hair. On dissection it was found to be a ball of hair, about two inches in diameter, very tightly rolled and sewn round a small circle of cord by means of twine passed through a piece of scalp. Further examination shows that the microscopical structure is identical with that of human hair with a similar breadth of 75 microns; this measurement is three and four times smaller than the breadth of the coarse vegetable fibres of the two true ch\u00e9mara babi which are 300 and 225 microns respectively. Various suggestions have been offered by Kelantan Malays as to the source of this tuft of hair. It is said that it may have come from the corpse of the first born child of first born parents, dug up by night from the grave; that it is rambut di-jalin hantu, or hair that has been tangled by ghosts on the head of a dying woman, or perhaps a trophy from some woman who had been scalped.\n\nChow Kiew, the high priest of the Siamese community in Kelantan (To' Cha), has given me some information about the Siamese letters and drawings. With good humoured contempt he said the design was not a reliable amulet such as an old man like he himself could have made, but a spurious charm made by a Siamese \"witch doctor\" for a few dollars. He explained that the central figure of Buddha is surrounded by an ornamental frame, and that the numerals and letters are taken from the sacred books of Siam apparently at haphazard. All the other figures are supposed to represent a child in various stages of uterine development as well as at birth. He drew particular attention to the wild boar's tusk which he declared to be solid throughout and that another like it could not be found among a thousand pigs.\nREDI.\n\nBy R. H. Adams.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Winstedt's paper on \"Some more Malay Words\" (Journal 80, 1919, p. 136) may I suggest that redi \"a sort of hammock-litter\" is probably from the Portuguese rede (pronounced raidy) \"a net\"? It is the word always used in Brazil for the sleeping-hammock.\n\nThe Indian Origin of Malay Folk-Tales.\n\nR. O. Winstedt.\n\nIn my paper on the \"Folk-Tales of Indonesia and Indo-China\" (Journal 76, 1917) I gave several parallels between Indian and Malay folk-tales. The more one studies the subject, the more one realizes the immense debt Malaya owes to India for folk-tales as well as for language, religion, custom, literature and general culture. I have not space here to discuss the two Malay versions of that store-house of folk-lore, the Panchatantra: the earlier version, mentioned by Werndly in 1736 A.D., and derived ultimately from the Persian, has been the subject of two of Brandes' invaluable papers (Tijdschrift voor Indische Taal-Landen Volkenkunde, Bat. Genoot., Deel XXXVIII p. 191 and Goeje's Feest-Bundel): of the Malay version translated by Munshi Abdullah from the Tamil I have given an outline elsewhere (Papers on Malay Subjects, \"Literature of Malay Folklore\", K. Lumpur, 1907.) So I shall advert only to such tales from the Panchatantra as appear outside those two Malay recensions of the Ht. Galila wa Damina, to use its Arabic name.\n\n'PA B\u0113LALANG.\n\nAn outline of this Malay folk-tale is given in my \"Literature of Malay Folk-Lore\" (pp. 62-63) together with a full translation of two of the tales (pp. 25-27). An outline together with the whole folk-tale in Malay is printed in Ch\u0113rita J\u0113naka (Winstedt and Sturrock, 2nd ed., Singapore, pp. 57-84). For every episode but two I shall here trace sources in Indian folk-lore.\n\n(1) 'Pa B\u0113lalang bids his son hide buffaloes and then gets a reward for divining their whereabouts.\n\nThis episode occurs in the Katha Sarit Sagara, (Tawney vol. I, p. 272) and in a Sinhalese story (Parker's \"Village Folk-Tales of Ceylon,\" vol. I, Tale 23, pp. 179-181).\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 82, 1920.\n(2) 'Pa B\u0113lalang discovers the thieves who stole seven chests of royal treasure, because he uttered the word *chur* \"Frizzle\" over the frying of seven cakes just as the seven thieves (*p\u0113nchuri*) came up.\n\nThis story follows the first both in the *Katha Sarit Sagara* and in the Sinhalese tale. A variant is found in Bodding's \"Folklore of the Santal Parganas,\" p. 207.\n\n(3) 'Pa B\u0113lalang tells the top from the bottom of a log by putting it into water, whereupon the heavy root end sinks first.\n\nThis tale occurs in *Jataka* 546, in a Tibetan Folk-Tale (Ralston's \"Tibetan Tales\" VII and VIII) and in a Laos tale (\"Bulletin de l'Ecole Francaise d'Extreme-Orient.\" Tome XVII, p. 114).\n\nThe incident of telling the sex of ducks recalls the Rabbinical story of how Solomon solved the puzzle set him by the Queen of Sheba to distinguish the sex of boys and girls similarly appalled. He ordered them to wash their hands. The girls alone washed up to the elbows!\n\n(4) The Raja catching a grass-hopper (*b\u0113lalang*) threatens death to 'Pa B\u0113lalang unless he can divine what is in his hand. 'Pa B\u0113lalang thinking of his son left fatherless blubbered his name \"B\u0113lalang! B\u0113lalang!\" and the king imagined he had divined right!\n\nIn the *Katha Sarit Sagara* it is a frog and in the Sinhalese tale (*op. cit.*, vol. I, pp. 184-5) a fire-fly and a bird on which the plot of this story turns.\n\nThe story is current in Persia (Sir J. Malcolm's 'Sketches of Persia', chap. XX) and is found in Grimm and in Dasent's \"Tales from the Fjeld\":\u2014vide Clouston's \"Popular Tales and Fictions\", vol. II, pp. 413-431.\n\nMAT JANIN.\n\nThis tale is given in Malay and English in *Journal* 48, (pp. 67-71). An outline will be found in my \"Literature of Malay Folk-Lore\" (p. 62).\n\nIn the *Panchatantra* (Dubois) a Brahman fancies he will sell his pots of provisions, buy a she-goat, which will bear kids, and so acquire a herd; then selling the goats, buy a cow and a mare, get rich, marry and have children. He would beat his wife for neglect of her household duty. Lashing out with a stick, he breaks the pot containing his provisions. Close variants may be read in the *Hitopadesa*, in Stokes' \"Indian Fairy Tales\", p. 31, and Swynnerton's \"Indian Nights' Entertainment\", p. 23, in Subramaniah Pantulu's \"Folk-Lore of the Telugus\", p. 48, in O'Connor's \"Folk-Tales from Tibet\", p. 31 in Bodding's \"Folklore of the Santal Parganas\", p. 146, and also in the Arabian Nights\"\n(Lady Burton's ed., vol. 5, p. 388), whose subject-matter is for the most part of Indian origin, and in a Turkish version of the \"Forty Viziers.\" The tale had reached Europe in the XIVth century. Clouston has a chapter on its wanderings in his \"Popular Tales and Fictions,\" vol. II, pp. 432-443. He quotes Max M\u00fcller:\u2014\"It seems a startling case of longevity, that while languages have changed, while works of art have perished, while empires have risen and vanished again, this simple children's tale should have lived on and maintained its place of honour and its undisputed sway in every schoolroom of the East and every nursery of the West.\"\n\nSI LUNCHAI.\n\nThis tale with an outline is printed in the Ch\u00e9rita J\u00e9naka (pp. 85-102). An outline is also given in my \"Literature of Malay Folk-Lore\" (pp. 63-65).\n\n(1) Si Lunchai is put in a sack to be drowned. He induces a Tamil merchant to take his place by declaring that he is about to be drowned for refusing to marry the king's daughter.\n\nNumerous variants of this episode occur\u2014a Sinhalese (Parker op. cit., vol. III, p. 435; vol. I, p. 110), a South Indian story by Pandita Natesa Sastu (\"The Indian Antiquary,\" vol. IV, p. 257), a Burmese (Mrs. Chan Toon's \"Triumph of Love and other stories\"), a tale in the \"Arabian Nights\" (vol. 4, p. 367). Cf. also C. Monteil's \"Contes Soudanais,\" (p. 67) and a Sierra Leone tale in Cromise and Ward's \"Cunnie Rabbit\" (p. 254).\n\n(2) Si Lunchai dresses as a Haji, goes before the king who had ordered his execution, and says that an angel had saved him from death and taken him to heaven where he had met the king's parents. \"If you would see their state in heaven, build a scaffolding; by virtue of a charm I will teach all who are not bastards can see thence into heaven.\" King and ministers lie and declare they can see!\n\nIn Swynnerton's \"Indian Nights' Entertainment\" (p. 60) a girl, who had vowed to prove that the king sometimes lied, invited him to visit a palace she had built and to see God thence; adding that he was visible only to one person at a time and only to those of legitimate birth. The ministers and the king all declare in turn they can see God, and are convicted of lying. The king marries the girl.\n\n(3) Si Lunchai tells the king that the way to heaven is down a deep pit, where a dragon devours him! Si Lunchai succeeds to the throne.\nThere are South Indian parallels to this episode viz. Natesa Sastr\u012b\u2019s \u201cThe Story of Madana Kama Raja\u201d, p. 97 foll. and \u201cThe Indian Antiquary\u201d, (vol. XVIII, p. 120.)\n\nMUSANG B\u0112RJANGGUT.\n\nIn J. R. A. S. S. B. No. 52 I printed with an English outline the farcical tale of Musang B\u0113rjanggut. Apparently the first part of that tale, where the hero does foolish things which the clever peasant girl so delights him by interpreting that he marries her, finds a parallel in the Laos folk-tale Sieu Sarat (op. cit., p. 114) but M. Finot\u2019s outline is too short for one to be certain. The clever peasant-girl whose wit brings her a royal or wealthy husband is common in Oriental folk-lore:\u2014Parker\u2019s \u201cVillage Folk-Tales of Ceylon,\u201d vol. III, pp. 112-114; Knowles\u2019 \u201cFolk-Tales of Kashmir,\u201d 2nd ed., pp. 484 foll., Swynnerton\u2019s \u201cIndian Nights\u2019 Entertainment\u201d p. 315, \u201cArabian Nights,\u201d vol. III, p. 202. The separating of mixed grain is common in folklore (Clouston, op. cit., vol. I, pp. 240-241). The story proper of the wife and her lovers collected together to their confusion comes in the Sanskrit Suka-saptati (Wortham\u2019s \u201cThe Enchanted Parrot\u201d, London, Tale XXXIII, p. 77) and in the tale of the virtuous Upakosa in the Katha Sarit Sagara; a shorter version occurs in the Hitopadesa (Wortham\u2019s translation, London, pp. 97-8). Neither of these versions contain (a) the incident of the lover playing the part of a pedestal lamp, or (b) that of the king-lover playing hobby-house for his exacting mistress or (c) the entrapping of the bearded man. There is a Sinhalese tale (Parker, op. cit., vol. I, pp. 222-3) containing the episode of a woman entertaining with cakes lovers, who in turn are hidden one in a loft, one on a shelf; one of the secreted lovers breaks a coconut on the bald round pate of the other as in the Malay tale. Perhaps the addition in the Malay tale that the bald pate represented the top of a human pedestal lamp is connected with the fable of the cat and the candle, which occurs in the originally Hindi tale, Ht. Gul. Bakawali (vide van Ronkel\u2019s \u201cLe Roman de la Rose dans la litterature malaise\u201d Tijd, L. T. L. Vk., Deel LIV): with that tale is associated the search for a rose to cure the king\u2019s malady, a plot very common in Malay literature derived from Indian models and apparently parodied in the quest for a bearded civet-cat as a sovereign cure! The hobby-horse episode occurs in the Panchatantra (Benfey, Leipzig 1859, IV, 6) where a minister\u2019s wife makes her husband shave his head and a king\u2019s wife drives her consort with a bridle. In the longer version of the Hikayat Bakhtiar, (Brandes\u2019 Tijd. T. L. Vk., Deel XXXVIII, p. 230 foll.) Tale 51, an Arabian vizier bids his king not devote himself to women but he himself becomes so infatuated with a girl that he plays hobby-horse for her; when the king sneers, the vizier protests that his advice was intended to save from any such ignominious infatuation:\u2014Brandes compares a passage in the Bustanu\u2019s-Salatin, (van der Tuuk\u2019s \u201cMaleisch Leesboek\u201d 1863,\np. 34). The entrapping of the bearded lover and producing him before a prince as a captive beast is not found in the Sanskrit originals to which I here have access: it is the plot of Tale XV of the Batavian recension of the *Ht. Abu Nawas* (*J. R. A. S.*, *S. B.* No. 81, p. 20.) Many other versions of the *Musang Berjanggut* occur in addition to those mentioned: one in the Arabic text of the book of *Sindibad*, one in the \u2018Arabian Nights\u2019, one in the Persian tale of the \u2018Thousand and One Days\u2019, one in the \u2018Bahar-i-Danush\u2019, one in Mary Stokes\u2019 \u201cIndian Fairy Tales\u201d, one from Bengal (G. A. Damant\u2019s \u201cFolklore of Bengal\u201d Indian Antiquary, 1873). Clouston gives an outline of these versions in his chapter on \u201cThe Lady and Her Suitors\u201d in his \u201cPopular Tales and Fictions\u201d, vol. II, pp. 289-316. It would be interesting to know from what immediate source the composite Malay tale was derived.\n\n**A SOUND FOR A SMELL.**\n\nIn *J. R. A. S.*, *S. B.* No. 48, 1907, p. 91 Mr. Laidlaw printed the Malay story of how mouse-deer settled the claim of a rich man on a poor fellow who grew fat on the appetite got from the smell of roasting in the rich man\u2019s kitchen. He was paid by the chink of 1,000 dollars counted out behind a curtain: \u201ca sound for a smell\u201d was mouse-deer\u2019s decree. Exactly the same tale is found among the Laos (*Bulletin de L\u2019Ecole Francaise d\u2019Extreme-Orient Tome XVII*, 1917, p. 114). A tale by Rabelais (III ch. 37) is identical. Liebrecht (*Zur Volkskunde* 503) gives a Japanese recension. Many Indian variants of the same central theme exist:\u2014vide \u201cOld Deccan Days\u201d (Frere) p. 118, \u201cFolk-Tales of the Telugus\u201d (Pantalu) p. 17, \u201cTibetan Tales\u201d (Ralston) p. 163, all of which give tales that are a mixture of this Malay tale and the tale in *J. R. A. S.*, *S. B.* No. 46, 1906, pp. 85-88.\n\nIn the \u201cKatha Sarit Sagara or Ocean of the Streams of Somadeva\u201d, tr. from the Sanskrit by C. H. Tawney (Calcutta 2 vols. 1880-84), a rich man promises to pay a musician for singing but later protests, \u201cYou gave a short-lived pleasure to my ears and I gave a short-lived pleasure to yours by promising you money\u201d. Cf. Julien\u2019s \u201cContes et apologues indiens\u201d, Paris 1860, 25, La Promesse vain et le vain Son). In the *Bhisapuppha-Jataka* 392 (Francis and Thomas, \u2018Jataka Tales\u2019 p. 263) the Bhodisatta smells a lotus but is told by a goddess that it is larceny thus to steal perfume.\n\n**MOUSEDEER TALES.**\n\nA synopsis of Peninsular Mouse-deer Tales will be found on pp. 44-48 of my \u201cLiterature of Malay Folk-Lore\u201d. A great number of the tales occur in Indian folk-lore.\n\n(1) Buffaloes release Crocodile whose tail has been pinned by the fall of a tree: Crocodile repays this kindness by seizing one of them by the hind-leg till Mousedeer com-\ning up pretends to disbelieve the story of the release, gets Crocodile to show his original position and shouts to the Buffaloes to drop the log on him again. (J. R. A. S., S. B. No. 45, 1905 and cf. Skeat\u2019s \u201cFables and Folk-Tales from an Eastern Forest\u201d p. 20).\n\nI have already referred to two Indian, a Tibetan (O\u2019Connor\u2019s \u201cFolk-Tales from Tibet\u201d, p. 12) and a Mon version of this tale (J. R. A. S., S. B. No. 76, pp. 122-3). The closest parallel is to be found in the Panchatantra (Dubois) and other Indian versions are Frere\u2019s \u201cOld Deccan Days\u201d, p. 198 foll., Steel and Temple\u2019s \u201cWide-Awake Stories\u201d, p. 116, \u201cTales of the Punjab\u201d, p. 107, Stokes\u2019 \u201cIndian Fairy Tales\u201d, p. 16, Parker (op. cit., vol. III, p. 446 and 447). Hottentot and Soudanese versions also occur\u2014vide Clouston op. cit., vol. I, pp. 262-265.\n\n(2) Mousedeer is caught by a crocodile but escape by saying it is not his leg but a withered branch which has been nipped.\n\nIn Frere\u2019s \u201cOld Deccan Days\u201d, p. 310 and Gordon\u2019s \u201cIndian Folk-Tales\u201d (p. 63) and in Boddington\u2019s \u201cFolklore of the Santal Parganas\u201d (p. 341) a Jackal so escapes from a Crocodile; in two Sinhalese tales (Parker, op. cit., vol. I, p. 235 and 381) a turtle from a Jackal and a Jackal from a Crocodile; in Theal\u2019s \u201cKaffir Folk-Lore\u201d (p. 187) a Jackal from a Lion.\n\n(3) Mouse-deer is caught fast in a \u2018Tar-Baby\u2019, pretends to be dead, is thrown aside as a corpse and leaps away.\n\n\u201cThe wonderful Tar-Baby\u201d (J. C. Harris\u2019 \u201cUncle Remus\u201d) is perhaps the most remarkable instance of the insidious spread of buddhistic tales\u201d. (Jacobs\u2019 \u201cIndian Fairy Tales\u201d p. 251) Vide A. Werner\u2019s paper in \u201cFolk-Lore\u201d X 282, and Mrs. Rhys Davids\u2019 \u201cBuddhist Psychology\u201d p. 35. In Pancavudha-Jataka 55 the story of a young prince hitting and sticking to an adhesive goblin gives the germ of the tale. In Sam. Nik a monkey\u2019s limbs and head are caught in an adhesive snare.\n\n(4) Mouse-deer is worsted in a race with King-Snail who ranging his subjects along the shore bids each in station pop up ahead of the running Mouse-deer. (Skeat op. cit., p. 33 gives the story of the King-Crow and the Water-Snail and cf. Bezemer\u2019s \u201cVolksdichtung aus Indonesien.\u201d p. 20).\n\nIn a Laos version of the Panchatantra (Part I Nandapakarana) an identical tale is told of how Garuda was worsted by a tortoise: in a Siamese version (\u201cThe Orientalist\u201d, vol. I, pp. 87, 88) a Turtle worsts Garuda; in\na Sinhalese tale a Turtle worsts a Lion (Parker, op. cit., vol. I, pp. 244-245); in \"Folk-Lore of the Santal Parganas\" (p. 329) ants worst an elephant; and in Milligan's \"The Fetish Folk of West Africa\" a chameleon beats an elephant. See also Clouston, op. cit., vol. I, pp. 266-273.\n\n(5) In Laidlaw's \"A Mouse-deer Tale\" (J. R. A. S., S. B. No. 46) mouse-deer wanting to eat a sleek sambur-deer gets tiger to pretend he is dead and while being carried a corpse for burial he jumps up and catches the deer who is one of the bearers. In Putimamsa-Jataka 437 (Francis and Thomas \"Jataka Tales\", p. 306) the jackal has a mock-funeral in order to capture a goat.\n\n(6) Mouse-deer eats Tiger's share of the meat and puts bitter bark in its place.\n\nCf. a Sinhalese tale (Parker, vol. I, p. 211) and \"Folk-tales of the Santal Parganas\" (p. 338).\n\n(7) The borrower of an axe declares he cannot return it, as it has been eaten by weevils. Mouse-deer, black with ashes, says he has been singed putting out the sea which is on fire. \"An unlikely tale,\" says King Solomon. \"Not more so than that of an axe eaten by weevils.\"\n\nA parallel story occurs in the Tamil version of the Panchatantra (Winstedt's \"Literature of Malay Folk-Lore\" p. 50). In a South Indian story (Ramaswami Raju's \"Indian Fables\" p. 45) a horse-thief declares the missing horse was eaten by a tree to which it was tethered. The Jackal said he was tired from throwing hay into the sea to quench its flames and postponed the case. When questioned how hay could quench flames, he enquired how a tree could eat a horse.\n\n(8) In Skeat's \"Fables and Folk-Tales\" p. 30 a mouse-deer induces two bulls to fight and, when one is killed, the mouse-deer feasts on the flesh after frightening away a tiger who wants to share it.\n\nParker (op. cit., vol. III, p. 23) compares a Jataka tale (No. 349, vol. III, p. 100) and gives a Sinhalese version. Variants occur in Dubois' \"Le Pantcha Tantra\" p. 30, Tawney's Katha Sarit Sagara, vol. II, p. 27 and in the Hitopadesa.\n\n(9) Skeat (op. cit. p. 45) gives a story relating how, in order to save an elephant, a mouse-deer frightened a tiger. An ape went back with the tiger, but mouse-deer shouted that he would not accept one tiger only when two had been promised, and tiger fled.\nVariants occur in Wortham\u2019s \u201cThe Enchanted Parrot\u201d (Suka-Saptati) Tales XLII and XLIII, in Dubois (op. cit.), in Small\u2019s Tota Kahani (p. 98), in Sinhalese (Parker, vol. I, p. 214), in a Kashmiri tale (Steel and Temple\u2019s \u2018Wide-Awake Stories\u2019), in Chinese, in Tibetan (O\u2019Connor\u2019s \u201cFolk-Tales from Tibet\u201d p. 76), in Baudes-son\u2019s \u201cThe Mois\u201d and there are Hottentot versions. See also Clouston op. cit., vol. I, pp. 146-150.\n\nSeveral of the variants include the incident of two frightened animals having their tails tied and of one of the tails breaking, as they start back in terror. The Malay version of this variation is given by Laidlaw (J. R. A. S., S. B. No. 48, pp. 87-89).\n\n(10) In Klinkert\u2019s Hikayat Pelandoek Djinaka is the tale of how mouse-deer challenges the beasts to drink up a river. In Kaka-Jataka 146 (Francis and Thomas p. 126) crows try to drink up the sea: Jacobs\u2019 \u201cIndian Fairy Tales\u201d 71 has a fable of dogs trying to drink a river dry.\n\n(11) Klinkert\u2019s Hikayat also gives the tale of an Ogre haunting the River T\u00ebnom:\u2014cf. the story of Badang worsting the ogre that stole his fish (S\u00ebjarah M\u00eblayu, ch. 6). Stories of water-ogres guarding lakes and molesting all comers till worsted by hero prince or wily monkey occur in Jatakas 6, 20 and 58; in the Mahabharata (Dutt\u2019s tr., Calcutta, III, chs. 311-313) and in Benfey\u2019s Pantschatantra. The device of pretending that bonds are a cure for lumbago and so getting one\u2019s enemy to suffer himself to be bound occurs in a Sinhalese folk-tale.\n\nWhat folk-tales came to the Malays early along with Sanskrit and Buddhism and Shivaism from India? and what later from India after the coming of Islam? Much comparative study will be required definitely to solve these questions.\nThe Founder of Old Singapore.\n\nBy R. O. Winstedt.\n\nAccording to the *S\u0113jarah M\u0113layu*, (Leyden\u2019s \u201cMalay Annals,\u201d pp. 20-44) the founder of old Singapore was Sang Nila Utama. He was the grandson of Raja Suran and the son of Sang Sapurba, ruler of Minangkabau, and he had a brother Sang Maniaka. The more scholarly author of the *Bustanu\u2019s-Nalatin* made Sang Sapurba, Sang Baniaka and Sang Nila Utama, three brothers, the children of Raja Suran.\n\nIt is very probable, as Blagden has suggested (J. R. A. S., S. B. No. 81), that Raja Suran represents a Chula king who was at enmity with Palembang and ravaged Palembang\u2019s subject state Kedah.\n\nIt is hardly perhaps known to English students that van der Tuuk, in his *Bataksch Leesboek*, IV, pp. 115, has robbed Singapore of its legendary founder by identifying Sang Sapurba, Sang Maniaka and Nila Utama with Suprabta, Tilottama and Menaka, three well-known nymphs (*apsaras*) of Indra\u2019s heaven, who on his orders were sent down to try the weakness of the flesh of religious ascetics. They are mentioned in a Kawi work, called *Wiwaha* (*Kawi-Studien. Arjuna-Wiwaha*, Kern, The Hague 1871). van der Tuuk thinks that the *Hikayat Nila Datia Kuacha*, included in Werndly\u2019s list of Malay works, or *Ht. Datia Nila Kuacha* as it should be called, was based on the *Wiwaha*; the Titan (*daitya*) Nilakawacha being the hero of the *Wiwaha*, against whom Indra appealed to Arjuna for help. Cf. Wilkinson\u2019s \u201cEnglish-Malay Dictionary\u201d *sub Ranjuna*.\n\n\u2018Mena\u2019 or \u2018Menaka\u2019 and \u2018Tilottama\u2019 may be found in Dowson\u2019s \u201cClassical Dictionary of Hindu Mythology\u201d.\nThe Malay Peninsula in the XVIIth & XVIIIth Centuries.\n\nBy A. Caldecott.\n\nThe following extracts from books not easily obtainable for reference out here may interest students of local history.\n\nIt is generally said that Singapore was deserted except by a few Malay fishermen from the date of its destruction in 1377 A.D. by the great Javanese kingdom of Majapahit down to the date of its second founding by Raffles in 1819. References in these extracts go to disprove quite such a sweeping statement.

The originarie or first inhabitants of this place report, that the beginning came of six or seven fishermen of Siam, Pegu and Bengola, who built a towne, and framed a particular language, taking all the best kind of speech from other nations. They named their towne Malacca, which is growne so rich and mightie in a short time by reason of her situation, as she contends for precedence with the greatest townes, yea with some realmes thereabouts.\n\nThe Qualitie of the Countrie.\n\nThe ayre is so troublesome, as not only strangers, but even they that are borne there are many times troubled with divers infirmities, which fasten chiefly to the skinne and haire: so as it is\nalmost a miracle if any one escape with life: which makes many forbear to goe thither: yet the desire of gaine doth incite many to hazard their healths by this voyage. The countrie yeelds not any fruit, but some little corne in certain places. Finally, all the realme of Malacca, which runs two hundred and seventie miles in length, is in a manner nothing but a desert, if you except that which is neere unto the towne. The Countrie people sleepe upon trees for feare of Tygers, whereof there are so many as they will come into the towne for a prey. The Portugals who tooke this towne from a King of the Moores, found the situation so commodious, as they have made it in a manner the center of all the merchandise and trafficke of the East, and the head of a kingdome, which extends from Sineapura to Pullo, and Cambilan; yet, as I have said, the aire is unwholesome, by reason that it lies so neere the Equinoctiall, and is hot and moist.\n\nThe Manner of the People.\n\nThere are in this place about a hundred families of Portugals, which live after the manner of their countrie, with a Bishop, and a College of Jesuits, besides the Castell. They that are borne in this place weare long haire, they have malitious spirits, and take delight to commit murders in the night, to the end the authors may not be knowne. Both men and women make love alike, and thinke that there is not any Nation can manage it so well: they make amorous songs and rimes, and doe wonderfully commend the power of love in their verses, which are wittie, well composed, and of a good grace. They have the neatest and most elegant language of all the East: and therefore many of the Indies doe use it: as in England, Germanie, and the Low Countries they use the French tongue.\n\nThe Riches.\n\nThere is a staple in this towne or a Market place, with the trafficke of all the Indies, of China, and of the Islands that are called Molucques, and other neighbour islands: and there you may see many vessels from China, the Molucques, Banda, Java, Sumatra, Siam, Pegu, Bengola, Choromandel, and other places, which returne laden with merchandise. This place yeelds great profit unto the Governor, and more than any other, except Mozambique and Ormus. Euerie yeare there parts a ship from Portugal for Malacca, a month before all the rest, and goes not to any other part of the Indies without constraint. They receive their lading only at Malaca, and have the best of all them, that come thither. There are six hundred Portugals continually in the fort of Malaca.\n\nThe Government.\n\nThere was sometimes a Mahometan king at Malaca, but hee was dispossest by Alphonso of Albuquerque, for that he sought to annoy Lopes of Sequiera a Portugal all he could: so as both the towne and realme are now under the dominion of the king of\nSpaine, and this realme is now governed like unto the rest which obeys this prince. They coyne money both of gold and silver there, whereof the inhabitants before had not any use, for that they did use certaine money of Tinne, which did weigh much, and was worth little.\n\nThe Religion.\n\nThe Portugals which remaine at Malaca doe all hold the Romish religion, and they that are borne in the country, whom they call Mallayes, are for the most part Christians: but there are many merchants whose aboade is sometimes long, which are of divers religions, and live at libertie. There is (as I have said) in the towne of Malaca a Bishop as at Cochin, but he is under the Archbishop of Goa.\n\nOf the Estate of the King of Brama or of Pegu, pp. 754, 755.\n\nThe realme of Siam which they also call of Sorneo is very great, and extends as well upon the East part as West, unto the sea. It lies between the Country of Couchin China and the realme of Jerme, in regard of that which lies within the land; and as for the coast, it extends from the towne of Campae unto that of Tauay, and this makes about five hundred leagues. It is true, that the Moores and Arabians have usurped almost two hundred, and hold the townes of Patane, Paam, Jor, and Pere; and the Portugals have seised upon the townes of Malaca.\n\nThis realme comprehends certaine particular kingdomes, that is to say, that of Siam, first called Chaumua, then that of Muantay (in which is the towne of Odie) and those of Brame, Caiprimo, Chaneram, Camboye, and Campae; and moreover Iangome, Cuctay, and Lancaam, which three realmes are inhabited by the Layes. The chief townes of all this realme are Siam, Odie, Cambaye, Campae, Sincapure, Malaca and Quedoe.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nThe towne of Sincapure lies in the remotest Southerne part of this countrie upon a cape, which some take for the great Promontorie whereas Ptolemee sets the towne of Zabe: but Magni thinkes it is rather Ptolemees Palure, from whence they go that will pass by sea into Chryse or Japon. As for the towne of Malaca, I have described it in the discourse of the king of Spaine\u2014Quedoe is a famous towne by reason of the pepper that grows in that territorie.\n\nTHE THEATRE of the Empire of Great Britain ............and a prospect of the most famous Parts of the World .............. By John Speed.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 82, 1920.\nIndia extra Gangem contains several Territories which are either large kingdoms of themselves or are divided into divers lesser kingdoms: the first are six, namely 1. Brama or Barma, 2. Couchinchina, 3. Camboia, 4. Jangoma, 5. Siam, 6. Pegu, 5. Siam, a peninsula, the same which of olde was termed Aurea Chersonesus, or the Golden Chersonese; and supposed by some to be Solomon\u2019s land of Ophir; as the other tract of this part of India was called the Silver Region. This Peninsula contains within it the Kingdom of Malaca, Patane, Jor, Muantay, and Siam peculiarly so called. Malaca, denominated from its emporium, or city of greatest trade, belongs to the Portugueses who have also Sinicapura and Pulo Zambilan. Patane, or as some say, Pathane, to distinguish it from that Patane already mentioned, (i.e. Patanau and Patane in Indostan), taking name also from its greatest city; where, by the Queen\u2019s leave (for it hath of late been governed by Queens) the English and Hollanders save their several factories.\n\n* * * * *\n\nQuedoe, a towne of great trade for pepper, of which the best sort is there to be had.

When it was in possession of the Crown of Portugal it was a place of great trade, and frequented more than any other town in India, except Goa, here being the rendezvous of their shipping from China, Japan, the Spice Islands, etc.\n\nThey built the castle and fortified the town with a wall, and it had five parochial Churches, a College of Jesuits, and was a Bishop's see, but the Dutch have let all the Churches run to ruin, except one; and the trade is removed to Batavia: it is now only inhabited by two or three hundred families of Dutch, Moors, Portuguese and Chinese, with some Malays who live in the suburbs, and has a garrison of two or three hundred soldiers. This place is naturally very strong, and by its situation commands the Streights of Malacca: The Dutch, who are masters of it, overawe all the little princes on those Coasts, and compel them to deal with them on their own terms; they look upon themselves to be lords of that part of the world, and almost exclude all other Europeans from any share of the trade.\n\n15. Sincapura is situate in the first degree of North latitude, and gives its name to the Eastern part of the Streights of Malacca.\n\n16.

This town, and the province it gives its name to, have thrown off their allegiance to the King of Siam; but the Dutch are in a position to give laws to them when they please, and it is only because they do not think it worth their while that they have not a garrison there.\n\nP. 71. The principal trade of the English in this country is driven at the port of Malacca, in the possession of the Dutch: hither the English send two or three country ships yearly from the Coast of Coromandel and the Bay of Bengal, with Callicoes, slight silks, opium, etc., and make profitable returns in canes, rattans, benjamin, long pepper, sugar, sugarcandy, sapan wood, and sometimes gold may be had at a reasonable rate; but this is a trade prohibited by the Dutch, and carried on by connivance of the Governor, council and fiscal.\n\n* * * * *\n\nMr. Lockyer has given us the following account of their weights and prices goods bore there in the year 1704.\nThe weights, he says, are 16 mace to 1 buncal of 1 ounce 9 pennyweight 12 grains Troy; 100 catty are a pecul of $137\\frac{1}{2}$ lbs., is $5\\frac{1}{2}$ lbs. larger than the common China pecul; and 3 pecul are a bahar.\n\n(Selections) Price Current July 1704.\n\n| Item                  | Rixdoll. | Sk. |\n|-----------------------|----------|-----|\n| Aquila wood per pecul | 50 to 150| 00  |\n| Canes per mille       | 60       | 00  |\n| Copper per pecul      | 24       | 00  |\n| Gold Acheen per buncal| 24       | 00  |\n| Gold China ditto. 93\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) touch | 24 | 06 |\n| Opium per chest       | 312      | 00  |\n| Quicksilver           | 80       | 00  |\n| Rattans per 100 bundles 14 foot long | 16 | 00 |\n| Sugar per pecul       | 03       | 00  |\n| Tyn per behar         | 40       | 00  |\n\nTo this account of the trade of Malacca I shall subjoin a farther description of the place and inhabitants, extracted chiefly from Mr. Dampier and Mr. Lockyer, who were both upon the place.\n\nThe town of Malacca stands on a low level ground, close to the sea-side: on the East side of the town there is a river, which at spring-tide will admit of small vessels, and on the East side of the river stands a strong fort, between which and the town there is communication by a drawbridge: this fort is built at the foot of a little steep hill, and is of semicircular form, like the adjacent hill: the walls are founded on rock, very thick, and carried up to a considerable height; and the lower part of them is washed by the sea at every tide: on the other side of the hill, there is a large moat cut from the sea to the abovesaid river, which makes it an island: and that part next the land is stocked with great trees: on the hill stands one little Church which serves the Dutch inhabitants; and it is to be presumed, the Portuguese, who are pretty numerous, may have a chapel in the town: but travellers do not mention any temple for the rest of the inhabitants.\n\nIn the town are between two and three hundred families of Dutch, Portuguese, Chinese, and Moors, and two or three great Armenian merchants. The Chinese have the best shops; the houses are generally built with stone and the streets are wide and strait but not paved: The native Malayans who inhabit the suburbs, live in poor mean cottages, and are kept in great subjection by their haughty Dutch masters: but it is observed, they still retain a desperate sullenness in their looks: and the Malayans of the neighbouring provinces have frequently revenged themselves on the Dutch for the tyranny and oppression exercised on them and that restraint the Hollanders put upon their trade all along the Malayan Coast by their guardships, insomuch that it is very difficult for their people to trade with any but the Dutch.\nThe town of Malacca is healthful, considering the climate, and is neither subject to the hot winds of the Coast of Coromandel, or those chilling ones in Sumatra. It is not a place of any great trade at this day; but as the Dutch are masters of the Streights of Sunda to the South of Sumatra, and this town gives them the command of the Streights which bear the name of Malacca to the North, while they are in possession of this place they have in a manner the trade of China and Japon in their hands, and can exclude any other nation from it they happen to be at war with. Indeed ships may pass the Streights of Malacca without coming within reach of the guns from their fort; but then they have guardships ready to intercept their enemies; and they continually make the Portuguese pay toll for every ship that passes by at this day, as the Portuguese formerly served them. And it is observed, this town is naturally so strong, that the Dutch could never have taken it, if the Portuguese had not been frightened out of it.\n\nCollier's Dictionary.\n\nSecond Edition 1688.\n\nMalacca. A town of Asia, in the Peninsula of the Indus on the other side of the Ganges, called formerly the Golden Chersonese. It has the kingdom of Siam to the North and is everywhere else surrounded with the ocean. Heylin says it is 270 English miles in length, of a disproportionate breadth, extreme hot, and, though neither populous nor fruitful, yet very rich by its commerce with all nations. In 1500 the King of Siam, from whom Malacca revolted, endeavoured to reduce it with 200 ships, 3000 men, and 400 elephants, but in vain. The Aire of it is unwholesome, but the conveniency of the Harbour, and the great trade makes it famous, not only in the Indies but even in Europe.\n\nThe country and town of Malacca belonged to the king of Ihor. The duke of Albuquerque conquered it for the Portuguese, who built a fort there and made it an episcopal see; but the Hollanders took it after 6 months seige in 1640. The town of Malacca is situate upon the Streights which separate the firm land from the Isle Sumatra. It rains twice or thrice a week here, all the year over, except in the months of January, February, and March. The air is very good and agrees very well with strangers, though the Portuguese published the contrary, to hinder other nations from settling there.\n\nMandesto, Olearius, Linchot\u2019s voyage to the Indies. Maginen. Geogr.\n\nMalaises. A people in the kingdom of Malacca, in the Peninsula of Indus, beyond the Gulf of Bengala. A great number have settled themselves in the kingdom of Siam. They are Mahometans; but there is some difference between their religion and that of the Turks and Persians. They are good soldiers and great robbers.\nSiam is commonly divided into eleven provinces, which formerly had each of them the name of kingdom, viz. Siam, Martavan, Siara, Tanasserim, Keda, Pera, Thor, Juncalaon, Paarn, Patana and Ligor; some of them still retain the name of principalities, but they who possess them pay tribute to the King of Siam whose subjects they are. There are also other countries which have the name of kingdoms and are tributary to the King of Siam, as the kingdom of Camboja, Gehor, Patane, Queda, Singgora, etc., the most part of which do every year present a nosegay of golden flowers as a tribute.\n\nIhor. A citie and kingdom of the Indies, within the peninsula on the other side the Ganges. It is situated on the most Southerly part of the Indies, near Malacca, which King Ihor often attacked. The city which gives its name to the kingdom is built upon piles, near unto a river which runs unto the sea near the promontory of Syncapura. There is a good Port; and the greater part of the city is named Batusaber, and the least Cotasalran.\n\nPatana. A country unto Malacca, in the Peninsula of Indus, beyond the Gulf of Bengala, tributary to the king of Siam. The town Patana stands upon the seashore. The king and palace and that part of it where the Grandees of the Court live is fortified with pallisadoes. The air is very good, though they have a great deal of heat there. Their summer begins in February and lasts until the end of October; and during the months of November, December and January it rains continually with the wind at North East. They have one sort of fruit or other every month and their hens lays eggs twice a day: great plenty of cattle and fowl, and a vast number of tigers, elephants, and monkeys in the woods. The inhabitants are of the Mahometan religion and are stately and conceited in their gate, but their conversation is civil enough. The Chinese and Siamese who have settled here are very intelligent and understand sea affairs but the Malaccese apply themselves only to Husbandry and fishing.\n\nSalmon's Geographical Grammar 11th edition 1769.\n\nThe Malayan Pater-noster.

Amen.\nPerak the Arrow-Chosen.\n\nBy R. O. Winstedt.\n\nIn *J. R. A. S., S. B.* 1, p. 85, Sir William Maxwell translates an extract from the *Marong Mahawangsa* or \"Kedah Annals,\" of which the original may be read on p. 62 of *Journal* 72 (1916). It relates a Kedah claim that Raja Marong Mahapodisat founded Perak, selecting the site of its capital by loosing a silver (*perak*) arrow called Indra Sakti and building a town on the island where it fell. As related in my \"History of Kedah,\" the only island in Perak known to have borne that name was named and settled by Sultan Iskandar who ascended the Perak throne in 1765 A.D. (Vide *Misa Melayu*, published in the \"Malay Literature Series,\" Singapore 1919). But admitting the absurdity of the legend, whence did a Malay chronicler get the non-Malayan idea of choosing a site by loosing an arrow, a weapon seldom or never employed by people of his race, into trackless forests?\n\nIn 2 Kings, chapter 13, verses 14-17 there is the story of how Elisha bade Joash the king of Israel shoot an arrow eastward out of the window, \"the arrow of the lord's deliverance from Syria.\" The shooting of an arrow to determine a site was practised by the Persians in Sassanian times. The Haji-abad inscription (Martin Haug's \"Introductory Essay on the Pahlavi Language\" prefixed to Dastur Hoshangji Jamaspji Asa's \"Old Pahlavi\u2014Pazand Glossary,\" Bombay and London 1870) gives one instance. Again Tabari the famous Persian historian (b. A.D. 839-d. A.D. 923) tells us that when the Persian general Wahriz, the conqueror and governor of Yemen, felt his death approaching, he called for his bow and arrows, bade his retainers raise him up and shot an arrow into the air, commanding those who stood by to mark where it fell and to build a mausoleum for his body there. (N\u00f6ldeke's \"Geschichte der Perser und Araber zur Zeit der Sasaniden,\" Leyden, 1879, pp. 263-264). This story is also related by the Arabian historian Dinawari (ed. Guirgass 1888, p. 66). The practice continued into Muhammadan times and was used by the Arabs as well as the Persians as is shown by a passage in al-Baladhuri's *Kitabu futuhil-buldan* (ed. de Goeje, p. 276.)\n\nEvidently in this Kedah legend we meet another instance of Malay indebtedness to Persian models, such as is seen in the introduction to the *S\u0113jarah Melayu* (Wilkinson's \"Malay Literature\" I, p. 18) and in the introduction of the same type to the \"Kedah Annals.\"\nThe Boria.\n\nBy A. W. Hamilton.\n\nPenang is the home of the Boria and this annual feast of fun is looked forward to by old and young Malays and Chinese alike with the greatest excitement and curiosity.\n\nThe name Boria is applied to the performances of a troupe of strolling minstrels who appear during the first ten days of the Muharram and at no other time of the year. Each troupe consists of twenty to forty youths, usually friends or inhabitants of the same locality, who band together for the purpose of enjoyment and emulation with the prospect of earning enough money for a bean feast on the completion of their labours. Being as penurious as the majority of their fellow countrymen they have first to find a manager who will finance the whole concern and reimburse himself with interest from the profits.\n\nThis matter being arranged, a tukang karang or composer and leading tenor is chosen and it devolves on him to determine the key-tune or chorus of the troupe and the words to be sung to it, which should contain allusion to the locality from which the troupe spring and if possible a reference to what they represented last year. It is necessary next to divide the party into the two divisions of musicians and players, the latter being subdivided into star-turns and chorus.\n\nHaving decided what the troupe is going to represent such as a band of European or Arab soldiery or a group of Chinese or Javanese or any other class of people, the manager proceeds to purchase outfits suitable for the part and hires or borrows the musical instruments.\n\nThe band usually consists of half a dozen instruments varying in nature with the representation, and it approximates both in tune and structure to the national instruments of the country represented. A cavalcade of Bedouins would give prominence to the maruas and a group of Indians to the dol whilst Chinese or Europeans would be incomplete without the addition of cymbals (che\u207f che\u207f) and a drum (tambor) respectively.\n\nThe one essential instrument is the violin as it is the accompaniment to the recitation of the tukang karang or composer.\n\nThe two or three star turns are now arranged with regard to the capabilities of the actors to mimic the dancing of the nationality represented, or some trait in their character or well known feature of their daily life. The field is wide and full advantage is taken of it to portray chetties and sensen, blustering officers and coy dancing girls, together with a host of other well known characters.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 82, 1920.\nIt only remains to marshal the chorus of twenty or so under a leader and to supply them with walking sticks, staves or wooden guns as occasion demands and a large flag or insignia to be carried at their head.\n\nThe preliminaries complete, undress rehearsals take place nightly for an hour or two in some secluded spot, and last for a week, the performers being regaled with light refreshments at the manager's expense.\n\nAll being ready, on or about the 5th of Muharram the troupe will set forth in full war paint soon after dark in search of any householder willing to receive (sambut) and reward them. There is no difficulty attached to this search. It is customary for any well-to-do Malays or Chinese and even for clubs, who wish to see the performances, to light up their compounds, clear an arena and sit down with their guests invited and uninvited to await the coming of the Boria.\n\nThe troupe is not long in making its appearance, its advent heralded by the blowing of a horn or similar instrument. The whole band defiles into the arena, to the accompaniment of music and shouting combined with the waving of sticks, and takes up its position facing the principal guests, the chorus forming a background and the band to one side.\n\nThe tukang karang or composer dressed in resplendent uniform comes to the fore and sings the chorus of his troupe, so that all may know what they are and which district they hail from. This is followed by the whole troupe singing the same refrain in chorus to the loudest music of the band and accompanied by a rhythmic swaying of bodies and brandishing of sticks. The composer then proceeds to sing several verses each punctuated by the chorus of the troupe as before. The quality of these verses depends on the ability of the composer and varies from the set and stilted phraseology of welcome and thanks to the donor of the entertainment, to complimentary and jocose remarks about the various notabilities present, made in the hope of extracting a small present in return. Occasionally the composer dispenses with this procedure and recites a mirthful tale of the arrest of a nyonyah's gambling party or the story of a cock-fight or of some notorious local event of the past year. Whatever the narration, as soon as it is finished the musicians strike up another tune and the star performers go through their turn of dances or acts acrobatic or otherwise.\n\nThe performance having lasted about half an hour and other troupes being impatient to enter, the close of the piece is announced in a short verse or two of farewell and the troupe marches out to find fresh fields to conquer.\n\nSo the evening wears on with troupe after troupe until the early hours warn both performers and onlookers that it is time they seek rest. These nightly revels continue until the evening of\nthe 10th of Muharram when they are continued all night until the following morning. Then the jaded troupe wends its way to some previously selected pleasure ground near a stream where after a short mandi-mandi or cleansing they devote themselves to the enjoyment of a well-spread table often with a ronggeng in accompaniment, until they disperse homewards soon after noon tired but supremely happy. This feast and in fact all the refreshments supplied during the performances as well as the incidental expenses of riksha fares, etc. are supplied by the manager who also presents each member of the troupe with the customary 25 cents when dispersing homewards after each night's performance; in addition to this, the tukang karang, the star turns and the band are paid a definite salary of two or three dollars a night, apart from any present that they may receive from the audience.\n\nThe financial aspect from the manager's point of view is often none too bright, the only assets being the takings from each house of from $5 to $10 or say $80 for an evening, and at the outside $400 for the season. Against this are to be set the cost of outfit $100, fares and salaries $150, expenses in connection with the feast $100 or a final profit of $50.\n\nIn Penang the Borias are often a day late in their reckoning of the Muhammadan month so that their mandi-mandi falls on the 11th and not on the 10th of Muharram, which is the real Ashura or Tenth i.e. the date of the death of Hussain at Kerbela.\n\nIn Singapore and Malacca Boria performances in imitation of those in Penang are held during the month of Saafar from the 20th onwards so as to terminate on Mandi Saafar with the usual bathe and feast, but though popular at one time, only one Boria troupe exists now in Singapore as against forty to fifty in Penang.\n\nOnce upon a time the advent of the Boria season was rather dreaded by the more peaceful Muhammadans in Penang on account of the frequent collisions which took place between the two factions of the red and white flags, the followers of two noted Sayids of Acheen Street and Jelutong respectively, who had formed secret societies in imitation of and in conjunction with the Chinese. But of recent years this unruly element has died and only an echo remains in an occasional piece of red or white cloth tied to a stick or some challenging allusion in the chorus of one of the troupes concerned.\n\nIt would be a thousand pities if the Borias were ever allowed to die out if only for the sake of the opportunity they offer to budding composers, to say nothing of the fun provided free for masses whose lives are dull enough God wot.\n\nThe following is a typical chorus intimating that the troupe come from Hutton Lane (Jalan Hatin) towards Kedah Road (Kampung Melaka) and that they are playing the story of Laila Majnun this year in place of Panji Sumerang which was last year's performance.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 82, 1920.\n1. Laila Majnun orang yang muda,\nBersama adzab bersama sangsara,\nPanji Sumerang ubah cerita,\nDi-Jalan Hatin Kampong Melaka.\n\n2.

O. Winstedt.\n\nMany MSS. of this romance exist. References and descriptions will be found in van der Tuuk\u2019s catalogue of Malay MSS. belonging to the Royal Asiatic Society (\"Essays relating to Indo-China,\" vol. II, p. 10); in Juynboll\u2019s catalogue of the Leiden MSS. (p. 121); in van Ronkel\u2019s catalogue of the Batavian MSS. (p. 97) and in Snouck Hurgronje\u2019s \"The Achehnese,\" vol. II, p. 148. There are also MSS. of it at Brussels and the Hague. The late Mr. D. F. A Hervey owned a copy (300 pp., dated 1307 Malacca). An edition has been lithographed in Singapore (A.H. 1321); the text of which judged beside the selections given by van der Tuuk and Juynboll is corrupt. A poem, the Shair Indrapura, founded on the prose work has been printed in Singapore.\n\nMany quotations from the romance are given in Werndly\u2019s \"Maleische Spraakkunst\" (1736), and the book is mentioned by Valentijn (ed. 1726), III, p. 26. Nowhere have I found any reference which puts back the date of its composition earlier than 1726 A.D.\n\nThere is a well-known religious work the Sirat ul-mustakim composed by Shaikh Nuru\u2019d-din the author of the Bustanu\u2019s-salatin in A.H. 1044 (1634 A.D.)\u2014Juynboll\u2019s \"Catalogus,\" p. 257 wrongly gives the equivalent of the Muhammadan date as 1628 A.D. Of this work there are several MSS. at Leiden and Batavia; one edition lithographed in Singapore in 1330 A.H. (giving the date of the original composition 1044 A.H. on the cover); one printed in Masir (Egypt) in the margin of the Sabil al-muhtadin, which is founded on the Sirat ul-mustakim. Now on p. 32 of the lithographed edition and on p. 39 of the printed marginal edition occurs the sentence: tiada harus bersuchii dengen suatu benda yang di-hormati pada shara\u2019 saperti tulang dan kulit yang belum disamak atau barang sa-bagai-nya, tetapi harus istinja\u2019 dengen kitab Taurat dan Injil yang sudah berubah dari-pada asal-nya dan demikian-lah harus istinja\u2019 dengen kitab yang tiada berguna pada shara\u2019 saperti Hikayat S\u00ebri Rama dan Indraput\u00ebra, dan barang sa-bagai-nya, jika tiada di-dalam-nya nama Allah.\n\nProfessor Dr. Ph. van Ronkel has been good enough to examine the two Leiden MSS. and informs me that the passage occurs in both of them. He agrees with me that the passage may be accepted as occurring in Shaikh Nuru\u2019d-din\u2019s original work, so that clearly the reference proves the Hikayat Ind\u00e9raput\u00e9ra to be old enough to have been quoted as a profane classic in 1634. That\nthe Malay *Hikayat S\u0113ri Rama* (derived from a Tamil version) goes back to that period we know, because Archbishop Laud had acquired the Bodleian copy in 1633. Perhaps the fact that of the *Hikayat Ind\u0113raput\u0113ra* there are Bugis Macassar and Achehnese redactions is contributory evidence of its age.\n\nIn the Singapore edition and in some of the MSS. of the *Hikayat* there are a large number of *pantun*.\n\nIt is to be hoped that from the many MSS. a critical and scholarly edition of this romance may some day be prepared. Meanwhile it would help towards that end if the \"Commissie voor de Volkslectuur\" of Netherlands India were to print in its excellent series a text or texts from the two MSS. in Batavia.\nHikayat Jaya Langkara.\n\nBy R. O. Winstedt.\n\nThis romance is included by Werndly in the list of Malay books known to him in 1736 the date of the publication of his \"Maleische Spraakkunst.\" No MSS. of it exist in London, Leiden, Brussels or the Hague; I cannot say if copies are to be found at Paris or Berlin. One MS. was presented by Mr. R. J. Wilkinson to the Cambridge University Library. G. K. Niemann read a borrowed MS. of 97 pp., written in 1847 and containing some Javanese words like ingsun, kelir, gringsing wayang which do not occur in the MS. I shall describe (Bij. T. L. en Vk. No. 4, deel 3, 1879). There is a fragment of it in the Library of the \"Bataviaasch Genootschap,\" Bat. Gen. 53, summarized in van Ronkel's \"Catalogue,\" p. 162. Among the Hervey MSS. is a Hikayat Makdam Makdum which may be a version of it. In Raffles' Library Singapore there is a MS. of it (Logan Library No. 302) copied on the 15th of Rabi u'l-awal A.H. 1279 (A.D. 1863) and formerly the property of one Muhaidin of Kampong Melaka. A gloss on page 43 mentions the name of one Jaafar of Kampong Penyengat, Riau. Another gloss on the cover mentions the name of a Muhammad Idris of Kampong Rochoh. The size of the pages is $8\\frac{1}{2} + 6\\frac{1}{2}$ inches and the number of pages 102. At page 28 there is a lacuna and a space of $1\\frac{3}{4}$ pages left empty. There are several corrupt sentences and a few doubtful words: umu is found for ungu.\n\nThere is a Macassar version of the Malay romance from which an extract is given in Matthes' \"Makassaarsche Chrestomathie.\" The Malay romance differs entirely from the Javanese Jaya Langkara described by Cohen Stuart (Bij. T. L. en Vk. Dl. I bl. 44, and II bl. 150).\n\nBelow I give a summary of the contents of the Singapore MS. As van Ronkel has pointed out (\"Le Roman de la Rose dans la litterature malaise,\" Tijd. v. Ind., T. L. en Vk., deel LIV, afd. 5 and 6) the quest for a flower or some other rare object to be used as medicine is common in Malay romances. It is a motive borrowed from Indian folk-lore (Parker's \"Village Folk-Tales of Ceylon,\" vol II, p. 329). Possibly the Malay love-charm made of the petals of the chenduai, a flower to be found rarely in the mountains, is associated with this motive in romantic literature. In the Ht. Raja Kerang (van Ronke's Catalogue of the Batavian MSS. p. 180) the quest is for a manggo which brings offspring to a childless prince; in the Ht. Langlang Buana for jasmine which gives the prince a son; in the Ht. Pekar Madi (ib. pp. 167-171) for a fish whereof a sick prince had dreamed; in the Ht. Laksana (ib.\np. 190-2) and in the *Ht. Indra K\u0115yangan* (\"Essays on Indo-China,\" 2nd ser., vol. II, p. 36) for a musical instrument; in the folk-tale *Raja Budiman* (*R. A. S., S. B.*) for a bird, a remedy for sickness: in the *Ht. Indra Bangsawan* there are two quests one for a bamboo musical instrument the subject of the king's dream and one for the tigress' milk the only salve for a princess's eye (cf. Snouck Hurgronje's \"The Acehnhese\" vol. II, pp. 145-147 and pp. 143-5 and Parker op. cit., pp. 357-9). The *Ht. Indra Bangsawan* resembles closely in plot the *Ht. Gul Bakawali*, a modern Malay translation from the Hindustani of Nipal Chand. But the *Gul Bakawali* includes episodes which make it nearly identical so far as the broad plot goes with the *Ht. Jaya Langkara*. In both we have the son whose birth will bring his father disaster; the favouring of that son by supernatural powers; the wicked brothers who fall into duress; the quest for a magic flower.\n\nThe episode of the astrologer prophesying fortune for Jaya Langkara and the wicked half-brothers reporting that the astrologer has prophesied disaster from him for his father's kingdom is parallelled in the stories of the lying astrologers in the folk-tale *Raja Budiman* and in the folk-tale *Raja Donan* (*J. R. A. S., S. B.*). The prediction that, if a father sees his son, disaster will follow is common in Indian folk-tales (e.g. Steel and Temple's \"Wide-Awake Stories,\" p. 250): a kindred superstition underlies the Malay rule that after installation a Raja Muda (or Crown Prince) must cross a river and not for seven days meet the ruler who has installed him.\n\nThe *Ht. Raja Ta'bir* (van Ronkel's \"Catalogus\" pp. 161-2) is merely a variant version of the *Ht. Jaya Langkara* with an added episode. In it the hero Panji Mas Merang is the son of Raja Ta'bir Mukif of Hamasfati and princess Suganda Iram. His half-brothers, the sons of Suganda Bayang-Bayang of Chuchali, are named Jongkar and Jongkir. A seer Indra Wamaki takes the place of the *kadzi* astrologer. The flower grows on Mt. Undara. The prince of Madain falls sick and the name of his daughter who dreams of the flower in the possession of the princess and the two half-brothers is Firi Mangg\u00e9ri. She and Jongkar and Jangkir are imprisoned in Tumanggaturi.\n\nIn the Batavian fragment of our romance the father of Jaya Langkara is \u062c\u064a\u0646 \u0633\u064a\u0641\u062a and his wives Sukanda Chahaya \u0628\u064a\u0631\u0645\u0631 and Sukanda Chahaya Belambing whose sons are Mukdim and Makdum. The name of the princess is Ratna Kasihan as in Niemann's MS.\n\nThe following is a summary of the Singapore MS.:\u2014Saifu'l-Muluk, king of 'Ajam Saukat (\u0633\u0648\u0642\u0629 or \u0633\u0626\u0629 or \u0634\u062f\u062f\u0629) married princess Sukanda Rum and got no child; married Sukanda Bayang-\nBayang and got two sons Makdam (\u0645\u064e\u0643\u0652\u062f\u064e\u0645\u0652) and Makdim (\u0645\u064e\u0643\u0652\u062f\u0650\u064a\u0645\u0652). Allah grants Sukanda Rum\u2019s prayer for a son and she bears Jaya Langkara, with radiance as of a lamp about his head, (cf. *Katha Sarit Sagara*, Towney, vol. II, p. 133 and 145, *Cinq Cents Contes et Apologues*, Chavannes, vol. I, p. 301, II, p. 17, III, p. 172) and the harvest prospered on account of his birth. Astrologers prophesy luck for the young prince. Then the king sends Makdam and Makdim to consult a kadzi and they bring back a lying report that the kadzi prophesies disaster will come from their half-brothers.\n\nJaya Langkara and his mother are driven into the wilds, and live with wild beasts in a cave. Jaya Langkara strikes his hand on a rock and his finger gives forth water:\u2014an incident common in Indian folk-lore (*Maha Bharata*, Drona Parva LXII, where Indra so feeds Prince Mandhatri; Chavannes\u2019 *op. cit.*, vol. III, p. 216; Parker *op. cit.*, vol. II, p. 365.)\n\nHis royal father falls sick and astrologers say that the only remedy is a flower (*kembang kumkuma puteh*) which grows on a mountain in Egypt (*Masir*).\n\nNow the king of Madinah falls sick. His daughter Ratna Kasina dreams that only that same flower can cure him. She goes in search of it and on the way passes Jaya Langkara. Then Makdam and Makdim come. All three go on the quest, and come to the haunt of a dragon, Naga Guna, where Ratna Kasina has already somehow arrived:\u2014dahi-nya bagai bintang timor, hidong-nya bagai m\u00e9lor jantan, pipi-nya saperti pauh di-layang, t\u00e9lina-nya saperti t\u00e9lepk laboh, rambut-nya saperti mayang m\u00e9ngrurai, kening saperti taji di-b\u00e9ntok dan gigi-nya saperti saga m\u00e9rekah, dagu-nya saperti t\u00e9lor burong, pinggang-nya saperti pinggang-nya k\u00e9r\u00e9ngga, kaki-nya saperti kaldai dan tumit-nya saperti pauh di-larek, lengan-nya buntaran, dan b\u00e9ris-nya bagai bunting padi:\u2014the stock Persian similes for female beauty. (Winstedt and Blagden\u2019s \u201cMalay Reader,\u201d p. 193.) The dragon sends a black and a white cat to guard her.\n\nThe dragon lifts them all on his head to the crest of the mountain in Egypt. The dragon sleeps till the incoming tide shall bring the magic flower to this hill which is the navel of the seas. Impatient at this prolonged sleep (40 days) they get Ratna Kasina to pluck the flower which roots itself in her hand. Makdam and Makdim fail to take it from her hand. When Jaya Langkara succeeds in getting a leaf of the flower they push him, the leaf in his hand, into the sea:\u2014pushing a person off a cliff is a common episode in Indian folk-tales (*The Jataka*, No. 193, vol. II, p. 82, and No. 419, vol. III, p. 261; Chavannes *op. cit.*, vol. I, p. 50 and 112; Parker *op. cit.*, vol. III, p. 370.) The dragon waking sends two cats to trace his whereabouts.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 82, 1920.\nNow Ratna G\u0113mala, daughter of the king of Egypt, dreamt of this same magic flower which turned seven colours at once, and swore she would not eat or sleep till she got it.\n\nRatna Dewi, daughter of the king of Franks (F\u0113ringgi), also dreams of the magic blossom. Her father sends Bangbang S\u0113nama, (\u0628\u06a0\u06a0 \u0633\u0646\u0645), Langlang Laut and Langlang Samudra (a name occurring also in Ht. Indra Jaya), his three viziers, on the quest. Langlang Laut takes rich presents to deceive the king of Egypt, while Bangbang S\u0113nama sets out for the mountain and meets Makdam and Makdim and princess Ratna Kasina. The wicked brothers had made overtures to the princess, who reproved them with a quotation from the Hadith! Bangbang S\u0113nama captures the trio and imprisons the two brothers in the \u062c\u064a\u062f.\n\nThe two cats hiding under the house of the mangkubumi of Egypt hear of Jaya Langkara\u2019s capture and report to Naga Guna. The cat put in his ear, the dragon swims into the sea and finds Jaya Langkara still supported by a petal of the magic flower: he is revived by licking the bezoar in the dragon\u2019s palate. They reach a reef (ujong karang)\u2014Pulau Biram Dewa in Niemann\u2019s MS.\u2014on the shore of the land of the Franks and Jaya Langkara fights an ascetic Perputeh Undang-Undang (\u0641\u0631\u0641\u0648\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u0646\u062f\u063a) and compels him to become a Muslim. With the help of genies he releases his half-brothers from prison. Ratna Kasina and Ratna Dewi come out and the former tells them he is Jaya Langkara. They feast, get intoxicated with wine and exchange verses. Makdam marries Ratna Dewi. Jaya Langkara gets the magic flower.\n\nThe mangkubumi comes from Egypt to get the flower. Jaya Langkara fights and worsts him, but hearing of Ratna G\u0113mala\u2019s case goes to Egypt on Naga Guna\u2019s back and marries Makdim to Ratna Gemala. He tells how the magic flower has rooted in Ratna Kasina\u2019s hand. Then he and Ratna Kasina return to \u2018Ajam Saukat and the king\u2019s ill is cured.\n\nMakdam and Makdim come to \u2018Ajam Saukat and resolve to kill Jaya Langkara, as each of them lusts after Ratna Kasina. Ratna Kasina flees to avoid them and comes to Jaya Langkara in the dragon\u2019s cave. The two half-brothers stop the entrance to the cave and think they have slain their rival. But the dragon releases him, and takes him and the princess to Madinah, where they are married and bathed on a pancha-p\u0113rsada. The dragon fetches everyone including the astounded half-brothers to see the wedding. Jaya Langkara\u2019s mother weds the king of Madinah. Jaya Langkara is made king of Madinah.\nBustanu\u2019s-Salatin.\n\nIts date and author\n\nBy R. O. Winstedt.\n\nIn his account of the Malay manuscripts belonging to the Royal Asiatic Society London, that great scholar van der Tuuk, following the interlinear Malay version instead of the Arabic in the manuscript before him, stated that the *Bustanu\u2019s-Salatin fi dzikr al-awwalin wa\u2019l-akhirin*, \u201cThe Garden of Kings, showing forth the origin of all creation and the end thereof,\u201d was composed at Aceh by Shaikh Nuru\u2019d-din ibn \u2018Ali ibn Hasanji ibn Muhammad ar-Raniri of Gujerat in 1040 A.H., (1630-1631 A.D.) by order of Sultan Iskandar Thani \u2018Ala\u2019ud-din Mughayat Shah who reigned from 1636 till 1641 A.D.! This error was copied by most, if not all, scholars until Dr. Raden Husein Javadiningrat wrote his critical study of the Sultanate of Aceh (*Bij. T. L. en Vk. van N. I., Kon. Inst. Deel LXV*, p. 136 foll., 1910.) By this Javanese scholar it was at last pointed out that the Arabic in the text records that Shaikh Nuru\u2019d-din came to Aceh on Sunday the 6th of Muharram 1047 A.H. (May 31, 1637) and got instructions to compose this book from the Sultan on the 17th day of Shawwal in the same Muhammadan year (March 4, 1638). These dates I may add are given not only in the Arabic but also in the interlinear Malay text of Mr. R. J. Wilkinson\u2019s edition of two books of the *Bustanu\u2019s-Salatin* (Singapore, 2 vols., 1899-1900). Again in the margin of the *Taju\u2019l-Mulk*, (printed at Mecca in 1311 A.H. and in Egypt,\u2014editions on sale in Singapore) is published a treatise by Shaikh Nurud-din, called the *Bad\u2019 khalk as-samawat wa\u2019l ard* \u201cThe origin of the creation of heaven and earth,\u201d wherein in the Arabic of the preface it is stated that the author came first to Aceh on Sunday the 6th of Rajab 1047, but in the interlinear Malay translation of the Mecca edition Sunday the 6th of Muharram 1040 and in that of the Egyptian edition Sunday the 6th of Rajab 1040 is given as the date! That the treatise repeats the error of some of the MSS. of the *Bustan* is not surprising seeing that it is really the first book of the *Bustan* under another name. This fact, which unless I am mistaken has not hitherto been noted, would make the treatise useful for the preparation of a critical text of the *Bustan* (*cf.* for example Wilkinson\u2019s ed., p. 38, *Fasal pada m\u00e9nyatakan k\u0113jadian shurga* and the Egyptian ed., p. 62.)\n\nThat the correct date for the arrival of Shaikh Nuru\u2019d-din in Aceh was the 6th of Muharram 1047 A.H. is almost certain as our Javanese scholar finds only that date (May 31, 1637) of all the dates given fell on a Sunday. And the date when Shaikh Nuru\u2019d-din began to write the *Bustanu\u2019s-Salatin* will be March\n1638. At the same time, just as in the *S\u0113jarah M\u0113layu*, there are interpolations, and, though at the beginning of Book II the author expresses the intention of writing of the kings of Acheh down to Sultan Iskandar Thani (1636-1641 A.D.), there has been added the history of Sultan Inayat Shah who reigned from 1678 to 1688 A.D.\n\nBesides the *Bustanu\u2019s-Salatin*, Shaikh Nuru\u2019d-din ibn \u2018Ali ibn Hasanji ibn Muhammad a\u2019r-Raniri translated and wrote various other works: in 1044 A.H. the *Siratu'l-mustakim* (still reprinted and on sale in Singapore), in 1045 A.H. the *Kitab Hadith Nabi*, a Malay version of the Arabic \u062f\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u0622\u064a\u062f \u0628\u0634\u0631\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0642\u0627\u064a\u062f, in the reign of Iskandar Thani the *Tabyan fi ma'rifat al-adiyan* and the *Asrar al-insan fi ma'rifat ar-roh wa'r-rahman*, in 1052 A.H. (1642 A.D.) the *Akhbaru'l-akhirat fi ahwali'l-kiamat* and the *Jawahir al-'ulum fi kashf al-ma'lam*, and in addition several works directed against the heretical pantheism of Shamsu'd-din of Pasai and Hamzah of Barus (*Vide* van der Tuuk, \u201cEssays on Indo-China,\u201d Second Series, vol. II pp. 15-16, 49-50 and the \u201cCatalogi\u201d of Juynboll and van Ronkel.)\n\nThere has been some confusion (*vide* Snouck Hurgronje\u2019s \u201cThe Acehnese\u201d Vol. II, p. 12) of our author, who often styles himself Shaikh Nuru\u2019d-din Muhammad Jailani, with one Shaikh Muhammad Jailani ibn Hasan ibn Muhammad Hamid a\u2019r-Raniri, who came first from Gujerat to Acheh as a teacher of logic, rhetoric and jurisprudence in the reign (1577-1586) of Sultan \u2018Ala\u2019ud-din of Perak (or Mansur Shah, son of Sultan Ahmad of Perak), went to Mecca to study mysticism and returned to Acheh in 1588, Dr. Raden Husein Jayadinigrat combats their identity by several arguments. Our author in all his works describes himself as the son of \u2018Ali. In the *Bustanu\u2019s-Salatin* he actually mentions the time of the coming of his copatriot and describes him as the son of Hassan. Furthermore the dates of the two men differ by half a century. The Javanese scholar surmises that the earlier missionary was an older relative of the author of the *Bustan*.\nMALAY MANUSCRIPTS.\n\nin the libraries of London, Brussels and The Hague,\n\nBy R. O. Winstedt.\n\n\"Miscellaneous Papers relating to Indo-China,\" Second Series, Vol. II, pp. 1-56 contain a \"Short account of the Malay Manuscripts belonging to the Royal Asiatic Society\" by H. N. van der Tuuk. In the \"Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society\" 1899 Mr. C. O. Blagden printed a list of Malay MSS. subsequently bequeathed to that Society by Sir William Maxwell. We have Greentree and Nicholson's \"Catalogue of the Malay MSS. in the Bodleian Library\" (Oxford, 1910):\u2014to which Library I have since presented a MS. of the Ht. Shamshu'l-bahrain and one of the Ht. Raja Budak. Dr. Ph. S. van Ronkel has given us in English an \"Account of Six Malay Manuscripts of the Cambridge University Library.\" (Bij. T. L. en Vk. N. I. 6\u00b0, II, pp. 1-53). Appendix VII to Wilkinson's \"Malay-English Dictionary\" records a list of Malay MSS. presented by him to the same library. To complete these lists of Malay MSS. in English libraries, I translate below van der Tuuk's short account of Malay MSS. in the Library of the India Office and G. K. Niemann's paper on those in the British Museum. Fuller or up-to-date catalogues of the Maxwell collection, the Wilkinson collection and of the collections in the Indian Office Library and in the British Museum are badly needed. In a later number I hope to catalogue the few Malay MSS. in Raffles Library, Singapore, to which I here give reference numbers.\n\nJuynboll's \"Catalogus van de Maleische en Sundaneesche Handschriften der Leidsche Universiteits-Bibliotheek\" (Leiden 1899) and Professor van Ronkel's \"Catalogus der Maleische Handschriften in het Museum van het Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen\" ('s Hage 1909)\u2014these great works worthily carry on the tradition of van der Tuuk and should be in the hand of every serious student of Malay literature. To English students it is not so well known perhaps that Professor van Ronkel has also published catalogues of the Malay MSS. in the Biblioth\u00e8que Royale at Brussels and of those in the library of the Koninklijk Instituut. From these two last works I give a bare list of MSS.\n\nThere are other Malay MSS. in the Universiteits-bibliotheek of Amsterdam, in the possession of the Nederlandsch Bijbelgenootschap and in the Sch\u00f6mann collection at Berlin, which have not yet, so far as I know, been catalogued; and for those in the National Library at Paris we have at present only Professor Cabaton's \"Catalogue sommaire des MSS. indiens, indochinois et malayo-polynesiens\" (Paris 1912). The School of Oriental Studies, London, also possesses a few Malay MSS.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 82, 1920.\nVan der Tuuk's words are worth repeating here:\u2014\"it is only by a careful comparison of many manuscripts that a text can be furnished which may be depended upon by persons desirous of obtaining an adequate idea of the grammatical structure of the Malay language, and reluctant to trust the assertions of those who pretend that Malay is devoid of grammar.\"\n\n*Kort Verslag van de Maleische Handschriften in het East-India House te Londen* (Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch Indie,\" 1849, Eerste Deel, bl. 385-400.) Under this title van der Tuuk gives a catalogue, not yet superseded, of the Malay MSS. now in the Library of the India Office, London. The following is a summary.\n\nNo. 50, small folio and No. 51, large quarto, *Hikayat Chekel Waneng Pati.* The readings differ little.

The old king returned to heaven and his four sons ruled respectively over Kuripan, Daha, Gagalang and Wirabumi.\n\nNo. 87. *Ht. Pandawa Jaya.*\n\nNo. 89 and 90, fol. *Ht. Isma Yatim.* MSS. almost identical and agreeing in the episode of the singing peacocks with\na MS. in the Library of the Koninkl. Academie at Delft; but differing from Roorda van Eysinga\u2019s edition. (Singapore L. L. 297.)\n\nNo. 96, 8vo.\n\n(a) Ht. Pelandok Jenaka (vide No. 67.)\n\n(b) Five tales\u2014(1) Ht. Fakir, the story of a poor man who suddenly became a court favourite but losing favour lost his life. (2) Ht. orang miskin yang bernama Isahak who in place of reward for loyalty nearly lost his life but later won the king\u2019s favour. (3) Ht. Raja Jumjumah dengan anak isteri baginda, which agrees with the Leyden Codex No. 1401 (vide Meursinghe\u2019s \u201cLeesboek\u201d 1st part) but has nothing in common with the Ht. Raja Jumjumah translated in the \u201cAsiatic Journal,\u201d March 1823. (4) Ht. anak saudagar bersahabat dengan orang kaya dan miskin. The adventures of a merchant\u2019s son who tests his friends (Is this Tale 21 of the Ht. Bayan Budiman? R. O. W.) (5) Ht. anak saudagar menjadi raja. Following the instructions of his dying father a merchant\u2019s son marries his three sisters to three beggars, really three powerful spirits, and becomes a raja.\n\nNo. 98, small 4vo. Ht. Indra Jaya Pati. The hero, son of Kalawandu king of a realm in the west called Langkam Jaya is carried off in his seventh year by a spirit in the shape of a tiger to the mountain Mahabiru where the tiger vanishes after handing him over to Narada to learn magic. When Narada turns himself into a giant and a Garuda, Indra Jaya Pati alone of his pupils faces him. Finally the hero marries princess Chindra Nur Lela and is made heir apparent by his father under the title of Maharaja Bikrama Indra.\n\nNo. 151, 12vo. Ht. Ular Nangkawang: incomplete. (Vide MS. i British Museum infra.)\n\nNo. 210. Ht. Dewa Mandu or Ht. Kangsa Indra Pikrama Raja: incomplete.\n\nNo. 227. Ht. Raja Dewa Maharupa.

He gives him a bezoar-stone by whose magic virtue Darma Dewa gets his son. The magic stone brings the child whatever his heart desires. He succeeds his father with the title Maharaja Mahadewa. According to the colophon the story is called also Ht. Maharaja Mahadewa.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 82, 1920.\nNo. 228. *Ht. Parang Puting.* In a King's College MS. it is named the *Ht. Budak Miskin bergelar Raja Mambang Dewa Keinderaan.* The 2 MSS. differ little. The *Budak Miskin* is the son of the prince of Langkam Jaya and is brought into the world by the magic of Mambang Sagara Indra. He is born in the forest where his mother had been banished on account of her pregnancy. One of his feats is a fight with a sea-dragon, the oppressor of a princess.\n\nNo. 285, small 4vo. *Cherita Khoja Mubarak* or *Ht. Khoja Maimun* i.e. the *Ht. Bayan Budiman*: containing 22 tales. (See Winstedt's edition of this Malay version of the \"Tales of a Parrot.\")\n\nNo. 292, small 4vo. *Ht. Salindang Dalima,* a prose version of the well-known poem. Dewa Pri, prince of Bandan Pirus, lost life and kingdom owing to a Garuda. He left two children, the elder a daughter Sri Benian, the younger a son Bangsakara. Sri Benian bears a child, son of Dewa Laksana who had transformed himself into a pomegranate: hence the child is called Si Dang Dalima. Before she dies she puts the child in a chest and gives it to her brother with a request not to open it. Bangsakara travels and comes to a kingdom whose ruler has just died. He is chosen by a sagacious elephant to succeed to the throne. He marries the seven daughters of the dead ruler. To the youngest and dearest he entrusts the chest telling her not to open it. The elder sisters break the injunction and find in it a beautiful girl. Fearful she will win the king's heart by her beauty, they smear her with charcoal, set her to menial tasks and beat her when she lets the chicken eat the *padi.* Her only amusement is to sing. At last one day when the king was setting out for Tanjong Puri, Salindang Dalima besought him to visit the island of Bandu on his return to fetch her a certain rattan, predicting storm and contrary winds if he forgets. The king forgets and is driven out of his course. Then remembering he gets the rattan, whereof the girl made a swing. The king discovers who she is and hands the six cruel princesses over to her to punish. She punishes but forgives. One day her father Dewa Laksana, son of Mengindra and princess Chahaya Sinar, descends from Kumala Ratna, discovers and embraces his daughter, then fights and conquers the Garuda and reigns over Bandan Pirus. He gives his daughter in marriage to Raja Udara, son of Raja Diwangsa, prince of Tanjong Puri.\n\nNo. 295, small fol., 70 pp. *Ht. Nabi Yusuf.* Shorter but resembling the MS. translated in the \"Indo-Chinese Gleaner\" April 1821.\nNo. 327, small 4to. *Charita Taifa*, containing the first 10 tales of MS. No. 285. The introduction about the parrot and his master is omitted; and in place there is a discourse on the solace the romance brings. Resembling No. 285 closely in style and language, it differs in substituting Malay for Persian names.\n\nNo. 373 fol:\u2014\n\n(a) *Ht. Muhammad Hanafiah* (Singapore R. L. 372.)\n(b) *Ht. Shah-i Mardan* (or *Ht. Indra Jaya.*)\n(c) *Ht. Pelandok Jenaka* (*Vide* No. 67 supra.)\n(d) *Ht. Nabi Muhammad salla\u2019llahu alaihi wa-sallama b\u0113rperang dengan Raja Khaibar.* (= *Ht.

T. L. en Vk. 3,\u00b0 Vol. 6, 1871 pp. 96-101). Under this title G. K. Niemann gave a catalogue of 24 Malay MSS. in the British Museum (Nos. 12376-98) acquired from John Crawfurd\u2019s collection: he added that the Museum owns Malay MSS. obtained from other sources which are not included in his list.

N. Ridley, C.M.G., F.R.S.\n\nSERIES II.\n\nThis paper contains an account of some novelties collected of recent years together with various corrections and emendations based on the examination of types in the Kew and British Museum herbaria. Among the new species will be found one of the most conspicuous and striking Fig trees in the lowland country and probably the commonest species. Having been confused in herbaria with a rather less common species, *Ficus Miquelii*, King, a very distinct plant, this abundant tree had no specific name, and there are scarcely any specimens of it in the British herbaria. It forms another example of the overlooking of the common species due to the botanist's idea that what is very common all round him, must be very common in the European herbaria, which is frequently not the case. There is still a great deal to be learnt about the commonest plants in the tropics.\n\nANONACEAE.\n\n*Ellipeia*. This genus was founded by Hooker for plants with the characters of *Uvaria*, but with an oblong style, and a solitary ventral or subbasal ovule in the ovary and a one-seeded carpel. The original type was *E. cuneifolia*, to which he added in the \"Flora of British India\" *E. ferruginea*, *E. glabra* and *E. nervosa*, while King added *E. leptopoda*, *E. costata* and *E. pumila*. Of these *E. ferruginea*, *E. costata*, King, *E. leptopoda*, and *E. cherrevensis*, Pierre, certainly resemble Uvarias, with wide expanded axillary flowers, the petals subequal and lanceolate, and no style. All appear to be climbers.\n\n*Ellipeia cuneifolia*, Hook. fil. A lofty climber, has the flowers chiefly in terminal racemes, the petals do not expand, they are short and broad, rounded with a depression at the base and extremely unequal, the inner circle being very small. The anther has a broad, round appendage, and there is a distinct style. In the one-seeded carpel the stigma is lateral. I am more inclined to put this plant in the neighbourhood of *Orophea* though I know nothing else like it.\n\n*E. pumila*, King, is an erect shrub with small unisexual lateral flowers, cylindric carpels and terminal style. It seems to me extremely near *Popowia Hookeri*, King, and *Polyalthia argentea*, Hook. fil. I think it should be referred to the genus *Popowia*.\n\nJour. Straits Branch R. A. Soc., No. 82, 1920.\nE. nervosa, Hook. fil., is a big tree with extra axillary flowers, the petals all similar, not excavate at the base, the one-seeded carpel with a terminal stigma. The foliage much resembles that of Popowia nervifolia and I should be inclined to refer it to that genus.\n\nEllipeia glabra, Hook. fil. I cannot separate from Polyalthia. It will be seen that there are three distinct forms of plants included under the genus Ellipeia. The original one is very distinct from anything else known to me. The Uvaria-like species, E. leptopoda, E. ferruginea, etc. might be kept as a distinct genus under the name of Uvariella distinguished from Uvaria by the one-ovuled pistil and one-seeded carpels.\n\nPolyalthia purpurea, Ridl. n. sp. P. lateriflora var. Kallak Boerl. Ic. Pt. I.\n\nSmall tree about 15 ft. tall, glabrous branches, slender longitudinally wrinkled pale. Leaves narrow, lanceolate acuminate, base cuneate, coriaceous, nerves fine 12 pairs; midrib channelled above, reticulations fine, visible on both sides when dry, 8 inches long 2-2.25 in. wide, petiole thick, black, grooved .25 in. long. Flowers in clusters of about 4 on the branches; pedicels rather stout 1 in. long. Sepals ovate, round, pubescent .15 in. long. Petals outer elliptic, lanceolate, 1 in. long .25 in. wide, subacute, purple, inner petals shorter and narrower, acute, all glabrous. Stamens very numerous with flat round appendage. Ovaries very numerous with no style and small stigma, tips pubescent. Torus pubescent. Fruit oblong, blunt, .75 in. long, one-seeded, stalk 1 in. long.\n\nThis has long been cultivated in the Singapore Botanic Gardens with no clue to its history, but there is a specimen in Herb. Kew from the Buitenzorg Gardens named thence, Polyalthia lateriflora var. Kallak Boerl. In Boerlage\u2019s diagnosis it is given as Sumatran. Polyalthia lateriflora, King, is different from this in flower and foliage and is based on Guatteria lateriflora, Bl. Fl. Jav. t. 50. Polyalthia lateriflora, Kurz is P. simiarum, Hook. fil.\n\nPolyalthia hirta, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nSmall tree. Branchlets slender, hairy. Leaves lanceolate acuminate base rounded, narrowed glabrous except midrib beneath, nerves hardly visible above, beneath 7 pairs slender elevate as are the nervules inarching .1 in. from edge, 4.5 in. long, 1.25 in. wide, edges undulate, petioles hairy .05 in. Flowers 1-2 nearly sessile extra axillary .5 in. wide, pedicels very short,\nhairy, sepals lanceolate, hairy. Petals triangular lanceolate acute hairy outside, glabrous inside. Stamens rather broad with a round flat crest. Pistils about 6, hairy, style short, distinct; stigmas rather large suborbicular, hairy.\n\nPenang, Pulau Butong Reserve (Curtis 2745).\n\nThis species is allied to *P. dumosa*, King.\n\n**Polyalthia asteriella**, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nTree. Branchlets puberulous. Leaves thin, coriaceous lanceolate acuminate, base cuneate, nerves elevate beneath 10 pairs, 6 inches long, 3 inches wide, petiole thick .2 in. Flowers extra-axillary on a short pubescent peduncle .05 in. with a few small oblong ovate bracts, pedicels .5 in. long, appressed hairy. Sepals 3, short, ovate .05 in. Petals linear, fleshy, very narrow from a broader base .2 in. long, nearly glabrous. Stamens numerous, oblong, appendage flat. Pistils few, about 6, hairy ellipsoid, narrowed into a small style with a large ovoid stigma.\n\nPerak, Taiping Hills (Ridley 2986).\n\nThis very small flowered species is allied only to *P. longifolia* in its small narrow petals, but the petals are even smaller and narrower than in that species.\n\n**GUTTIFERAE.**\n\n**Garcinia Murdochii**, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nBranches yellow, angled, internodes .75 in., slender. Leaves coriaceous, elliptic, rather abruptly shortly cuspidate, blunt base cuneate, nerves very fine almost invisible on both sides, 3 in. long, 1.5 in. wide. Petiole slender .35 in. Flowers solitary, sessile terminal .5 in. wide. Sepals 4, ovate. Petals 4, obovate oblong, much larger and apparently red. Stamens in a round head 30 or more, anthers peltate, cells 2, crescent-shaped. Female no staminodes. Petals and sepals as in male; pistil subcylindric, stigma very large, cushion-shaped covering the pistil.\n\nPerak, Bikum reserve (Burn-Murdoch 371) male. Borneo, Kuching (Haviland 2339) female.\n\nThe Kuching plant has thicker smooth shining leaves with a prominent midrib, but otherwise so far as I can see the two plants agree. The solitary sessile terminal flower is unusual.\n\n**Garcinia minutiflora**, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nTree with rough-barked brown terete branches. Leaves coriaceous drying light green, elliptic blunt, almost truncate at top, base cuneate, edge thickened, nerves faint, about 7 pairs, more conspicuous above than beneath, inarching within the\nedge, nervules and reticulations nearly as conspicuous, midrib prominent beneath, 2 in. long 1.1 in. wide, petiole .15 in. Cymes on tubercles at the nodes less than .25 in. long, 3 branched branches, yellowish, angled. Flowers .15 in. long. Sepals 4, ovate yellowish. Petals 4, oblong ovate larger tip round white. Stamens minute in a globose head, anthers oblong, connective moderately wide, cells linear 2.\n\nLankawi Islands, Goa Chinta (Curtis 2802) March 1892. Not really like any species known to me in its small light green leaves and very small flowers.\n\n**Calophyllum lanceola**, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nSmall tree. Leaves lanceolate, narrowed nearly equally to both ends, tip acuminate blunt, base acuminate 2 in. long .75 in. wide, petiole .25 in. Flowers axillary solitary or in pairs. Drupe small globose apiculate .25 in. long on slender pedicel .5-1.75 in. long.\n\nKedah Peak. About 4000 ft. (Ridley 5751).\n\nAllied to *C. parvifolium*, Vesque (*C. microphyllum*, Anderson Fl. Brit. Ind.) but the leaves are quite different in shape. The flowers were all fallen when I found it and no one seems to have got it again on Kedah Peak.\n\n**Calophyllum oblongifolium**, Ridl. *C. pulcherrimum* var. *oblongifolium*, T. Anders. Fl. Brit. Ind. i. p. 271.\n\nThis is quite distinct from any form of *C. pulcherrimum* in its hairy buds, peduncles and petioles and the form of the leaf, the much longer racemes and the flowers nearly twice as large. It occurs in Malacca, Perak, Ulu Bubong and Ulu Slim (Kunstler 10929 and 1885).\n\n**Calophyllum neriifolium**, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nTree. Leaves stiff coriaceous, linear lanceolate to narrow lanceolate, blunt, base cuneate, midrib prominent on both sides, nerves very fine and inconspicuous slightly ascending, edge thickened 3.5 in. long .5 in. wide, petiole .15 in. Buds scurfy. Flowers not known. Fruit globose or oblong .6 in. long on a pedicel .6 in. apparently solitary.\n\nMalacca, Mt. Ophir (Ridley 3223).\n\n**Kayea parviflora**, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nBranches rather slender. Leaves coriaceous lanceolate narrowed to a blunt point, edge thickened, midrib elevate, nerves very faint about 10 pairs, nervules nearly as conspicuous 2 in. long, .5 in. wide, petiole .15 in. thick rugose. Flowers 5-6 in terminal fascicles, very small about .1 in. across, pedicels slender .25 in. Sepals orbicular, petals 4, oblong. Stamens very short.\nPerak, Tapah (Burn-Murdoch 382).\n\nThe leaves of this somewhat resemble those of a *Calophyllum* but the terminal flowers and stipules are those of *Kayea*.\n\n**TERNSTROEMIACEAE.**\n\n*Ternstroemia penangiana*, Choisy.\n\nThere has been a little confusion as to this plant owing originally to mixture in Flor. Brit. Ind. of two distinct species. Choisy based his species on Wallich\u2019s 4456, *Fagraea dubia*, a plant with broad obovate very stiff leaves. It has since been discovered on Penang Hill by Maingay and Curtis and has not been found anywhere else. With it has been confused *Erythrochiton Wallichianum* of Griffith obtained in Mergui, a totally different plant with thin lanceolate leaves and much larger fruit. This is the *P. penangiana*, Pierre, Fl. For. Cochin China t. 123 (though he figures the flowers far too small) and the *Garcinia acuminata*, Wal. Cat. 4871 A. King\u2019s description of *T. coriacea*, Scheff., applies very well to this, but he refers specimens of it collected in the Andamans and Nicobars by Kurz to *T. penangiana*. I have seen no specimens of *T. coriacea*, Scheff., but the description does not quite suit. The plant more resembles the Javanese *T. microcarpa*, Scheff., which has nothing to do with *T. penangiana* to which King refers it. I therefore retain the name *Wallichianum* for it from Griffith\u2019s *Erythrochiton Wallichianum*. The plant ranges over the Malay Peninsula from Singapore northwards to Mergui and occurs in the Andamans and Cambodia.\n\n**DIPTEROCARPEAE.**\n\n*Dipterocarpus rigidus*, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nBranchlets stout, densely softly hairy. Leaves coriaceous, ovate, subacute; base sharply narrowed, blunt, above glabrous, beneath minutely velvety; nerves 10-11 pairs, sunk above, strongly elevate beneath, hairy, 6 in. long, 4 in. wide. Petiole hairy stout 2 in. long. Panicle 4 in. long, few flowered, glabrous except at base. Flowers large. Calyx narrowly winged, 1 in. long, lobes velvety inside, glabrous outside, 3 lobes oblong, blunt .12 in. long, 2 blunt linear oblong .75 in. long. Petals linear, oblong, grey velvety on both sides, .2 in. long.\n\nJohor, Penyabong (Foxworthy).\n\n*Shorea alba*, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nTree. 100 feet tall, 4 feet through, glabrous except inflorescence. Leaves lanceolate caudate acuminate, blunt, base shortly narrowed thin coriaceous, above smooth, beneath nerves 6-7 pairs, elevate 3.25 in. long, 1.5 in. wide, petiole .5 in. transversely wrinkled. Panicles 2-5 in. long white mealy branches\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 82, 1920.\n.5 in. Bracts small. Flowers shortly pedicelled, white .25 in. wide. Sepals ovate acute, white tomentose. Petals ovate blunt, woolly all over, not oblique. Stamens 30, inner whorl with short broad filaments shorter than the oblong bifid anther. Appendage longer, densely ciliate ovary conic tomentose to style base. Style rather short, glabrous.\n\nPenang, Batu Ferenghi by the streams near the iceworks (Curtis 3651).\n\nNear S. barbata, but the leaves not glaucous beneath and the anthers not bearded.\n\n**Synaptea cuspidata**, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nTree. Branches scurfy. Leaves elliptic, lanceolate, long cuspidate, base narrowed, coriaceous, finely reticulate, nerves elevate beneath, 11 pairs, 5 in. long, 1.75 in. wide, petiole 1.5. Flowers not seen. Fruit ellipsoid, scurfy .5 in. long. Sepals larger pair linear oblong, 3 in. long, .36 in. wide, 5-nerved. Smaller ones .75 in. long ovate long acute cuspidate.\n\nDindings (Coll. Forest Rangers No. 413).\n\nPerhaps nearest to S. Perakensis, but the leaves are more coriaceous and finely reticulate, the inner sepals remarkably long acuminate cuspidate.\n\n**Vatica? stipulata**, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nGlabrous tree? Leaves thin, stiff, coriaceous elliptic lanceolate, base shortly narrowed, tip acuminate, edge thickened, nerves slender, about 6 pairs, reticulations visible; midrib prominent, 4 in. long 1.5 in. wide; petiole slender 1 in. long, thickened and black in upper third. Stipules large persistent, ovate cordate, round 3-nerved 1 in. long, .75 in. wide. Panicles axillary and terminal, very lax, branches slender about 1.5 in. long. Flowers .25 in. long, pedicels slender .15 in. Sepals small ovate, connate for half their length, scurfy puberulous outside and sparingly inside. Petals 4 times as long, linear, oblong scurfy on the back, not twisted. Stamens 10 filaments very short, ovary conic pubescent, grooved. Style columnar. Stigma clavate.\n\nMount Ophir (Hullett, 781) April 1888.\n\nThe fruits of this curious species not having been seen, the plant remains dubious. In the thin slender lax panicles it resembles V. pallida.\n\n**Balanocarpus Hemsleyanus**, King.\n\nNeither in flowers, leaves nor fruit, resembles the typical Balanocarpus. It is quite clearly a Pachychlamys, a genus allied to Shorea, but which I think advisable to keep separate.\nSTERCULIACEAE.\n\nTarrietia unifoliolata, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nBig tree. Leaves unifoliolate, glabrous, coriaceous, petiole 1 in. slender, thickened at tip, petiolule jointed on top .25 in., blade elliptic, subacute, base blunt, slightly inaequilateral and narrowed; nerves slender about 18 pairs, 2.25 to 3.5 in. long, 1-1.5 in. wide. Panicle about 4 in. long, pubescent. Flowers numerous .08 in. long. Calyx tube longer than the 5 short ovate lobes pubescent. Stamens column short, thick, andraecium globose, much shorter than calyx lobes. Carpels in female flowers 5.\n\nMalacca (R. Derry).\n\nNative name \"Kamuning hutan.\" Used as timber for construction while the plant is also used medicinally. This species is very near T. javanica, Bl. but the leaves are all unifoliolate with slender pedicels. It is possibly a form of that species but I think it will prove, when the fruit is known, to be a distinct plant.\n\nPeniculifera, Ridl. n. gen.\n\nTree. Leaves alternate distant oblong, lanceolate. Flowers in short axillary fascicles. Petals free to base, oblong, pubescent 5. Petals 5 linear, spatulate, hairy on inner surface. Stamens in a tube, hairy, anthers at the top very small 5, alternating with cylindric processes, 5 large anthers sessile at base of tube. Species one.\n\nPeniculifera penangensis, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nApparently a tree. Leaves oblong lanceolate, cuspidate acuminate, base round, chartaceous, nerves slender 8 pairs inarching 4-6 in. long .5 in. wide. Flowers about 12 in axillary fascicles, on short .05 in. peduncles, pedicels shorter all pubescent. Sepals .1 in. imbricate pubescent. Petals as long, hairy on inner face, spatulate, round rather thick. Staminal tube as long, funnel-shaped, very hairy.\n\nPenang, Government Hill at 1200 feet (Curtis 3745).\n\nThe specimens resemble in appearance Leptonychia glabra, Turez.\n\nLeptonychiopsis, Ridl. n. gen.\n\nTree? branches puberulous. Leaves oblong elliptic cuspidate base blunt, chartaceous alternate stipulate. Flowers small in axillary very short racemes. Sepals 3, valvate. Petals 3. Stamens 6, connate at the base in a ring, filaments filiform, anthers subhastate, blunt alternating with 4 linear staminodes. Ovary hairy 3-celled, ovules anatropous at least 2 superposed. Style filiform, stigma minute. Species one.\nLeptonychiopsis parviflora, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nLeaves abruptly cuspidate, nerves 8 pairs prominent beneath; nervules transverse undulate horizontal, midrib and nerves slightly puberulous, 4-6.75 in. long, 2-3 in. wide; petiole puberulous 2 in. Raceme hairy .1 in. Pedicels very short. Flower .25 in. Sepals puberulous outside, linear narrow, blunt. Petals similar in shape. Stamens as long.\n\nJohore, Gunong Pulai (Ridley 3743) brought by native collector in 1892.\n\nThis plant has much the habit of Leptonychia but has only 3 sepals, and 6 stamens with some staminodes, the ovary 3-celled.\n\nTILIACEAE.\n\nGrewia erythrocarpa, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nSmall tree, 12-14 ft. tall. Branches hairy. Leaves lanceolate, acute or acuminate, base round, slightly cordate and inaequilateral, edges sinuate, beneath hairy, midrib sometimes hairy above, nerves 10 pairs, the basal pair often halfway up the leaf, reticulations and nervules prominent beneath 8-10 in. long, 2.1-4 in. wide, petiole .25 in. long, thickly hairy. Panicles 3-5 in., rather compact hanging from below the branches, densely tomentose, hairy, pedicels short. Bracts lanceolate acuminate, green tomentose .2 in. long; sepals linear oblong, white, tomentose. Petals white, reflexed. Disc lobed, yellow. Ovary tomentose. Fruit 1 in. long, pear-shaped, scarlet.\n\nMountain Forests. Selangor, Sempang Mines (Ridley 15908); Perak, Waterfall Hill (Wray 599).\n\nMr. Drummond suggests perhaps G. perakensis, Drum., but I think it is very distinct, not only in the very long narrow leaves but in the pear-shaped scarlet fruits.\n\nRUTACEAE.\n\nAtalantia cuspidata, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nA spiny bush, branchlets pubescent, spines short, blunt straight. Leaves thin-textured, not coriaceous; ovate elliptic, cuspidate blunt, base round, pubescent on the back, midrib sunk above, elevate beneath the nerves about 6 pairs, very fine, forked at tip 2-3 in. long, .5 in. wide, petiole .2 in. long, pubescent jointed in the middle. Flowers solitary, pedicels .25 in. long. Sepals round, pubescent. Petals 5, linear, oblong .4 in. long, white. Stamens linear, oblong. Ovary cylindric, hairy. Style stout, glabrous. Stigma orbicular. Fruit ovoid, blunt 8 in. long, rind thin, pulp scanty; seeds 2 large, flattened.\n\nMalacca, Sungei Hudang; Dindings, Lumut (Ridley 8391, 9944).\nBALSAMINEAE.\n\nImpatiens Klossii, Ridl. Journ. Fed. Mal. States Museums, viii, part 4, p. 24. From the Korinchi Valley, Sumatra. The name is preoccupied by Impatiens Klossii, Ridl. Trans. Linn. Soc. Botany xi, p. 23, from New Guinea. The Sumatran species may therefore be known as Impatiens Bodenii, after Mr. C. Boden Kloss.\n\nBURSERACEAE.\n\nSantiria minutiflora, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nTree. Leaves 7 inches long; leaflets 5, coriaceous elliptic to ovate, cuspidate, acuminate, blunt; base broad or shortly narrowed; nerves about 6 pairs, elevate beneath slender, secondary nervules fine and conspicuous 3-5 in. long, 1.5-2 in. wide, petiole .1 in. Panicle lax, axillary 2-3 in. long. Flowers very small, cymose and racemose on the branch ends. Sepals broad, ovate, rather thick, blunt 3. Petals larger, ovate, blunt. Stamens 5, anthers sessile on a shallow cup-like disk. Pistil-lode round, grooved, style short, thick.\n\nFemale flower and fruit not seen.\n\nJohor, Tempayan River (Ridley 13250, 13260).\n\nDistinct in its stiff, rather small leaflets and very minute flowers, about .025 in. long.\n\nCanarium subcordatum, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nBark whitish grey. Leaves large, leaflets many crowded and overlapping, ovate lanceolate, long acute acuminate base round subcordate, stiffly coriaceous, glabrous, nerves about 30 pairs, slender subparallel, 10 in. long, 4 in. wide, petiole thick .25 in. long. Drupe oblong, triquetrous 1 in. long and 16 in. across the face.\n\nPahang, Pulau Tinggi (Burkill No. 906).\n\nThe specimen I have seen is very poor, only a portion of a leaf and 2 drupes, but I cannot find any species like it anywhere. The foliage is somewhat like that of C. hispidum, Bl., but quite glabrous and thickly coriaceous, the fruits somewhat resemble those of C. Radlikoferi, Perkins.\n\nMELIACEAE.\n\nAglaia Kingiana, Ridl. n. sp. A. Ganggo, King. Materials p. 65, not of Miquel.\n\nTree. 30 to 40 feet tall, 10-15 in. through. Leaves imparipinnate, leaflets glabrous, coriaceous, opposite, lanceolate acuminate, base very shortly cuneate 6 or more pairs, nerves 12 pairs, very faint on both sides, 3 to 4 inches long, 1.5 in.\nwide, petiole slender .4 to .5 in. Panicle 9 in. long, glabrous, branches spreading 3 in. or less long, branchlets short .5 in. long. Flowers light yellow .05 in. long. Calyx narrowed into a thick pedicel, lobes ovate, round, scurfy. Petals elliptic, blunt edge thinner, glabrous. Stamen-tube shorter open at the mouth. Anthers 5 large exsert, ovary small, hairy. Fruit unknown.\n\nDense jungle near limestone rocks. Perak, Goping (Kunstler).\n\nThis resembles *A. Ganggo*, Miq. in general appearance but the petals are shorter, and not scaly. Typical *Ganggo*, Miq. has narrow leaves, very oblique at the base and an ovoid stamen tube with a small mouth and small not exsert anthers. There is a plant resembling the Goping one named *Ganggo!* from the Buitenzorg herbarium at Kew, but it is not Miquel\u2019s plant.\n\n**OLACINEAE.**\n\n*Gomphandra salicifolia*, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nSmall tree with wiry branches, glabrous except the cymes. Leaves narrow, linear acuminate, base very shortly narrowed, midrib very prominent beneath, nerves invisible above, beneath 4-5 pairs; very short and inconspicuous forming conspicuous loops 3 in. long .3 in. wide, petiole .15 in. Cymes terminal compact, branches very short, peduncle .2 in., puberulous. Flowers crowded, glabrous. Calyx very small. Petals 4, oblong .15 in. Stamens 4, filaments broad, long, hairy below anther, a tuft of hair at the top.\n\nPenang West Hill (Curtis 739 and 1265) at 2,500 ft. alt. Very distinct in its willow-like rather coriaceous leaves.\n\n*Gomphandra pubescens*, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nShrub. Branches wiry, pubescent. Leaves lanceolate caudate blunt, base shortly cuneate, subcoriaceous, nerves basal pair running from near the base along the edge, nerves from midrib 6 pairs, midrib pubescent 3-5 in. long, 1 in. wide, petiole .15 in. pubescent. Cymes extra axillary compact .5 in. long, peduncle .25 in. pubescent. Flowers very small. Calyx-lobes large ovate, cuspidate gibbous at base. Petals 4, very short, filaments obtuse, very short, anther small with a short process at back.\n\nSelangor, Weld\u2019s Hill, Kuala Lumpur (Ridley).\n\nRemarkable for its very small flowers, and its pubescence.\nILICINEAE.\n\nIlex pauciflora, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nTree. Branchlets slender, whitish. Leaves coriaceous, rather thinly lanceolate, acuminate, base cuneate; nerves 7 pairs conspicuous beneath, inarching .15 in. from the margin, midrib bold, sunk above, 4.75 to 7 in. long, 1.25-2 in. wide; petiole .25 in. long. Panicles pseudo-terminal and axillary 3-4 in. long with 5 or 6 remote branches of which the peduncle is .5 in. long, slender and bifurcates with a pair of branchlets .26 in. long bearing 3 or 4 small pubescent cymes of 2 or 3 shortly pedicelled flowers .06 in. across. Sepals triangular acute, pubescent. Petals 4, round, twice as long, free nearly to base. Stamens as long, anthers short elliptic. Pistil conic; style short.\n\nPenang Waterfall (Foxworthy 10454).\n\nThe long few branched panicle with short few flowered dichotomous branches is not like anything I have seen.\n\nIlex illustris, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nBark blackish, longitudinally ribbed when dry, branches stout. Leaves very coriaceous, elliptic, blunt or minutely apiculate, base narrowed, shining, bright green above, light brown beneath when dry, edge crenate, midrib channelled on upper surface, very prominent below and sharply keeled, nerves about 8 pairs, prominent beneath, widely inarching .12 in. from the edge, secondary nerves nearly as prominent, reticulations wide, prominent, whole under surface minutely areolate 7 in. long, 3 in. wide, petiole stout .75 in. long. Flowers not seen. Fruit on a short .10 in. stout peduncle axillary with 5 or 6 flowers, pedicels .4 in. long, ovary .4 in. long, oblong, globose. Calyx connate, shortly triangular, blunt, 4-lobed. Stigma flat, 4-lobed. Pyrenes 4, backs rounded not grooved .25 in. long, .15 in. through.\n\nPahang, Gunong Tahan (Ridley 16172).\n\nThis fine holly is allied most clearly to *I. purpurea*, Hassk., a Japanese and Chinese species, from which it differs in its large stiff, coriaceous leaves, and much larger fruit with broad thick pyrenes. The crenulations of the leaf are most marked toward the top, and are shallow and distant. The main and secondary nerves are decurrent on the midrib.\n\nSAPINDACEAE.\n\nTurpinia.\n\nIn the Materials for a Flora of the Malay Peninsula King gives one species of *Turpinia*, *T. pomifera*, DC. (by misprint *pomiferes*) and a variety *sphaerocarpa*. De Candolle\u2019s species\nwas based on a Nepalese tree which is quite different from the Malay Peninsula one to which Wallich, evidently seeing the difference, had given in his catalogue the name *latifolia*. Wallich's No. 4939 is given for *T. pomifera* and the variety *sphaerocarpa* by King. The variety *sphaerocarpa*, King, is based on *T. sphaerocarpa* of Hasskarl, a Javanese plant which again is different from any plant we have in the Malay Peninsula, and it is clear that King's *T. pomifera* var. *sphaerocarpa* was intended for the commonest of the Malay Peninsula species, but the only specimens named by King in the herbarium I have seen are distinctly different from the common plant. *T. pomifera*, King, (not De Candolle), is only recorded by him from Perak (King's collector 4243), of which there is no specimen here in England and I have no clue as to what it was, but it is improbable that it was the true Nepal plant of De Candolle, *Dalrymplea pomifera*, Roxb.\n\nWe have also another very distinct trifoliate plant with large flowers which I propose to describe under the name of *T. trifoliata*.\n\n**Turpinia trifoliata**, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nA tree. Leaflets 3 distant, elliptic, blunt or cuspidate, serrate subequal, nerves 6 pairs fine, elevate beneath, curved upwards and branching at the top or before reticulations, netted and conspicuous when dry, rather thin in texture, drying light-greenish 6 in. long, 3 in. wide; central petiolule 2-3 in. long, laterals .5 in. long, petiole .2 in. long. Panicle 2-3 in. long, peduncle 1.5 in. long; branches short, dense flowered. Flowers white 3 in. across. Sepals ovate lanceolate narrowed small, lanceolate acuminate, persistent. Pedicels .05 in. Flowers white 3 in. across. Sepals ovate lanceolate narrowed to the round tip .15 in. long. Petals a little longer. Filaments short terete; anthers large, oblong, ovary large conic grooved deeply, narrowed upwards to the style. Stigma distinctly 3-lobed, lobes acute. Fruit ovoid, eventually globose .25 in. through when dry, the three styles as conic processes with grooves between.\n\nMalacca, Nyalas (Goodenough 1771); Selangor, Sempang Mines, Semangkok (Ridley 15906).\n\n**Turpinia latifolia**, Wall. Cat. 4939.\n\nTree 30-40 feet tall. Leaves over a foot long of 5 stiff dark green shining coriaceous leaflets, ovate elliptic shortly cuspidate or blunt, base short, cuneate or round or minutely serrate, drying dark fuscous green; nerves very faint above, 4 pairs, elevate beneath, ascending; petioles terminal 2 in. long, laterals .25-.5 in. wide, petiole 3 in. long. Panicles terminal and in upper axils, 3 or 4 terminal, with long 4 in.\nsecondary peduncles, 8 in. long with spreading branches and numerous small flowers in small cymes of two or three flowers or solitary racemes at the top of the branches.

Leaves 9-10 in. long, leaflets 5, ovate elliptic, blunt or acuminate entire or minutely crenulate, base round, coriaceous dark green, drying dark brown; nerves fine, 4 pairs ascending as in latifolia but fainter 4 in. long, 3 in. wide, petiole (terminal) .75 in., laterals .15-2 in. long. Panicles very lax, slender, spreading 15 in. long, minutely puberulous. Bracts minute, lanceolate acuminate. Pedicels .1 in. longer than the flower. Flowers white 12 in. across, in lax racemes solitary or 2-3 in a cyme. Sepals ovate, round ciliate. Petals much longer, triangular oblong, blunt, minutely denticulate. Stamens short, filaments slender, filiform. Pistil as in T. latifolia but smaller.\n\nSingapore Botanic Gardens on the rockery. Perak, Larut (Kunstler No. 2824).\n\nThe tree which has white bark sheds its leaves at certain times and flowers when the young leaves develop, but the panicles persist when the leaves are full grown. The young leaves when they first appear are narrow elliptic lanceolate, much longer than broad.\n\nNapeodendron, Ridl. n. gen.\n\nA very big tree entirely glabrous except the flowers. Leaves alternate pinnate with 2\u20143 pairs of leaflets; leaflets coriaceous. Panicles large, erect, flowers small, white. Sepals 4, ovate. Petals longer 4. Stamens 8, filaments short, thick, hairy, anthers ovoid shortly apiculate, ovary sunk partly in disc 2-celled, one ovule in each cell. Style short, stout. Stigma large, discoid. Fruit unknown. Species one.\n\nNapeodendron altissimum, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nVery lofty tree. Leaves, petiole 2.5 in. long, leaflets alternate or subopposite, coriaceous, glaucescient beneath, elliptic acute, base blunt, nerves elevate beneath 12 pairs, 3.5 to 5 in.\nlong, 1.75-2.5 in. wide, petiolules thickened at the top .2 in. Panicle axillary and terminal 8 in. long, basal half nude, branches 1.5 in. long. Flowers in short cymes at top .1 in. long, shortly pedicelled. Sepals 4, ovate puberulous. Petals 4, longer oblong puberulous. Stamens 8, outside the disc, filaments broad, thick, oblong, hairy; anther ovoid terminal apiculate. Disc deep annular edge thick; ovary partly free from disc 2-celled 2-ovuled. Style short, thick. Stigma large discoid.\n\nIn mountain woods, Ulu Gombak, Selangor.\n\nThis tree puzzled me much as I am unable to find any genus described at all distinctly resembling it. I have however, referred it to Sapindaceae, although the stamens and style are very different from those of any other genus. It was a handsome tree of the habit of Nephelium but taller than most.\n\nCurtisina, Ridl. n. gen.\n\nTree. Leaves imparipinnate. Leaves 4 pairs, coriaceous oblong. Panicle terminal. Calyx 3-lobed. Petals 3 oblong coriaceous, no scales. Stamens 6 outside disc, filaments short, thick, anthers oblong dehiscing along edge. Disc thick annular. Ovary 2-celled, sunk in disc but free, ovules one in a cell. Style conic, short. Stigma small subcapitate. Fruit bilobed or simple, fleshy, red 1-2 seeded.\n\nCurtisina penangensis, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nTall tree. Leaf 12 in. long. Leaflets oblong with a broad base and narrow to tip, lower ones oblique at base, nerves 8 pairs, elevate beneath, reticulations wide 4.5 in. long, 2 in. wide; petioles .5 in., terminal one 1 in. long. Panicle 4 in. long, branches 1.5 in. or shorter, distant. Flowers numerous, pedicels very short or 0. Calyx cup-shaped with three ovate lobes. Petals 3, oblong, coriaceous, valvate .1 in. long. Stamens shorter. Disc thick, elevate. Fruit pulpy bilobed, lobes rounded, .5 in. wide, red.\n\nPenang Hill at 2,200 ft. (Curtis 3648).\n\nI conclude this to be Sapindaceous from its ovary and fruit and can find nothing at all resembling it in that Order. It has somewhat the appearance of Dacryodes (Burseraceae) except in the fruit and ovary.\n\nNephelium Herveyi, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nTree. Leaves coriaceous, narrow, lanceolate, blunt acuminate base shortly acute, glabrous; nerves about 18 pairs, shining above subglaucous beneath 3-3.5 in. long 1.5 in. wide, petiole .18 in. Panicle 4-6 in. long tomentose. Sepals ap-\npressed, tomentose, acute ovate. Petals 5, very small linear, glabrous. Stamens glabrous. Fruit 1.25 in. long, red, covered with flat blunt spines .12 in. long, wide triangular at base.\n\nMalacca, Alor Gajah (Griffith) (Hervey, Maingay 3311 and 1630). Dindings, Pangkor, Boundary of the Dindings (Curtis 1389).\n\nThis plant at first closely resembles *N. rubescens*, Hiern, and indeed Hiern included these specimens under it. It differs however, entirely from that plant in the fruit, which instead of having very short scattered processes, is thickly covered with flat triangular based blunt spines after the manner of a Pulassan but broad at the base. The leaves are narrower and more coriaceous.\n\n**Tristira penangensis**, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nLarge tree. Leaves equipinnate 7 in. long. Leaflets 2-3 pairs, opposite oblong, blunt; base cuneate shortly chartaceous, pale glabrous, nerves 7 pairs, ascending elevate beneath, midrib prominent beneath, channelled above 3-5 in. long, 2-2.5 in. wide; petiolules .25 in., petiole 3 in. Panicle terminal, lax 8 in. long. Branches distant lower ones 2 in. long, spreading; upper part of panicles and branch tips pubescent. Flowers numerous fascicled on branches of panicle. Pedicels .1 in. dense, pubescent. Bracts lanceolate, minute, pubescent. Sepals 4, ovate, very woolly, pubescent outside .06 in. long. Petals 0. Stamens short, not exsert 5-7, anthers long, blunt, filaments short, filiform glabrous. Disc irregularly lobed and wrinkled, large, not oblique nor unilateral. Pistil conic 3-angled densely hairy. Stigmas 3, sessile on the narrowed tip, ovules solitary in cells.\n\nPenang, Government Hill 1,200 ft. (Curtis 1086).\n\nI am dubious as to the genus of this plant. It has the general appearance of *Erioglossum*, but it is more closely allied to *Lepisanthes* from which the terminal panicled inflorescence separates it. It seems to be quite apetalous and the fruit is probably triangular and hairy, but ripe fruit has not been seen. It is to be hoped that additional specimens may be obtained from Penang Hill.\n\n**LEGUMINOSAE.**\n\n**Vigna parviflora**, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nStems slender; leaflets lanceolate to ovate, tip narrowed, bases of lateral ones oblique membranous, glabrous, 2 in. long, .5-1 in. wide, petiolules .1 in. or less; hairy, petiole slender 1.5-2 in. long. Peduncles 1 in. long, slender. Flowers few, crowded at tips, yellow, .25 in. long, keel beaked. Pod sword-shaped, acuminate 2.25 in. long, .26 in. wide. Seed oblong, black, truncate at both ends .2 in. long, hilum long.\nSandy places. Negri Sembilan at Seremban; Perak, Tanjong Malim, Kuala Kangsar, Kuala Temengoh.\n\nI cannot identify this plant with any other species. Prain named it *V. vexillata*, Benth., but that has large purple flowers, this very small yellow ones.\n\n**Bauhinia flammifera**, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nThe common *Bauhinia* which forms such a conspicuous mass of colour in the woods of the low country in Selangor and Perak, has been identified by Baker, Prain and others as *Bauhinia integrifolia*, Roxb. In an expedition to Temengoh in Perak I found a very beautiful and distinct species of this group which I later named *B. holosericea*, but on critically examining the plants described as *B. integrifolia* in the Kew herbarium, I find that the original *integrifolia* of Roxburgh (of which there are specimens at Kew with his writing attached) is *holosericea* from Penang Hill, nor can I find any name for the common lowland plant to which I therefore give the name of *flammifera*.\n\n*Bauhinia flammifera*, Ridl. is a very lofty climber with obscurely angled twigs, scurfy red, pubescent when young. The leaves are thin in texture, ovate cordate, very rarely entire and usually shortly bifid or retuse at the tip, about 4-nerved and 3 in. long and up to 5 in. wide; petiole slender, 2 in. long and pubescent, the red pubescence running on to the nerves in old leaves. The terminal panicles are as much as 8 in. long and as wide; red, pubescent pedicels .6 in. long. Calyx-tube distinctly shorter than the sepals which are nearly glabrous. The petals are oblong crisped narrowing into the claw .3 in. long, hairy outside; rich yellow turning bright red. The ovary is hairy.\n\nOccurs in the southern half of the Malay Peninsula.\n\nDistrib. Malacca (Griffith); Selangor, common; Perak, Kinta River (814) and Sungei Raya (Kunstler 964), Taiping Hills.\n\n**Bauhinia integrifolia**, Roxburgh.\n\nHas much smaller leaves especially the ones in the flowering sprays and they are never bifid at the top. Branches and leaves beneath hairy, but sometimes nearly glabrous. The flowers are considerably smaller and the pedicels .8 in.; the rachis is black, hairy with shorter red hairs and the flowers fall off after flowering so as to leave a long bare rachis, very unlike the corymbose-like inflorescence of *flammifera*. The calyx is more hairy, the petals almost bristly. Roxburgh\u2019s drawing and description give them as light yellow, but I have seen them turning bright red.\nThis plant occurs chiefly in the north of the Peninsula: Pahang, Sungei Jelai (Machado); Perak, Kinta (Morton) Temengoh (Ridley 4674); Prov. Wellesley (Kunstler) and Penang (Roxburgh, Wallich, etc.) and Patalung in South Siam.\n\nThe whole of this group of Bauhinias seems to be almost confined to the Malay Peninsula with one or two outliers in the Malay islands, and it is a very critical group.\n\n**Crudia brevipes**, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nTree 16 feet tall. Bark of branchlets white. Leaves rather thin; leaflets three, elliptic lanceolate, cuspidate, base shortly narrowed, glaucous beneath; nerves 5-6 pairs, anastomosing within edge, reticulations netted, conspicuous, fine 2.5-5 in. long, 1-1.75 in. wide, petiolule .25 in. or less. Raceme slender, 5 in. long, base shortly nude .5 in. Flowers numerous, dense; pedicels very short, under .05 in. Sepals 4, oblong, blunt .08 in. long. Petals 0. Stamens 6, filaments much longer than the sepals, filiform, anther cordate. Ovary woolly. Style glabrous, filiform. Stigma small, cup-shaped.\n\nProvince Wellesley, Tasek Gelugur (Ridley 12653).\n\nNative name, Poko Bebaru.\n\nThe pedicels of the flowers are very short for this genus, and the flowers themselves very small. I find no more than 6 stamens in the flower and in one bud only 5. This is fewer than usual in the genus.\n\n**ROSACEAE.**\n\n**Coccomelia**, Ridl. n. gen.\n\nThe small tree *Parinarium? nitidum*, Hook. f., common in the South of the Peninsula and in Sarawak, was referred tentatively to *Parinarium* by Hooker and by King from insufficient specimens, though they pointed out it was not typically *Parinarium* differing in having a cushion-like process at the base of the calyx-tube which in other parts is lined by the swollen bases of the stamens. This hairy process or lining is apparently the disc, and lies on the front part of the tube. The fruit is a small, red pulpy drupe, with a one-celled stone. The stamens are 8-10 in number. This is very different from the typical *Parinarium* in which the carpels are usually 2, the stamens more numerous and the hairy disc seems to be absent, while in no species is the drupe really pulpy or red. In most *Parinariums* the \"drupe\" consists of a hard brown woody stone without any pulpy pericarp at all. Only *P. Griffithianum* of our species has a thinly fleshy pericarp.\n\nWhile this plant somewhat resembles *Parastemon* in appearance it is distinguished from that by its possessing 8-10\nstamens instead of only 2. It is therefore necessary to found a genus for it and I name it *Coccomelia* (the Greek for a Plum tree), the species thus being *Coccomelia nitida*, Ridl. The southern form from Singapore, Malacca, etc. and from Santubong in Sarawak, has rather narrow lanceolate leaves, the northern form from Penang Hill and Setul heaths has broader leaves, more rounded and larger fruit. Perak specimens seem to be intermediate. I call the northern one *Coccomelia nitida* var. *latifolia*.\n\n**LEGNOTIDAE.**\n\n**Carallia spinulosa**, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nTree or shrub. Leaves thin, elliptic abruptly acuminate, base cuneate edge spinulose, nerves fine and faint 14 pairs, secondaries as prominent reticulations, conspicuous, 4-5 in. long, 1.75-2 in. wide, petiole .2 in. Cymes .4 in. long on a peduncle .2 in., with 2 ovate acute bracts at base of the two branches, cyme branches short with numerous imbricating, round bracts at the top. Flowers sessile .2 in. long. Sepals 6 or 7, triangular, acute. Petals shorter, obovate reniform edges undulate, slightly toothed, with a very short claw, white, as broad as long. Stamens in two rows shorter than petals, one row adnate to the sepals, one from the disc enclosed in the petals. Style columnar, stigma capitate. Disc a thick fleshy ring obscurely lobed. Fruit ellipsoid with persistent sepals .2 in. long (dry) 2-seeded.\n\nPerak. Tanjong Malim (Ridley 11858) Cambodia, Tonkin Dong-Dong (Balansa 1506).\n\nThis has been referred to *C. lucida*, Roxb., a plant of south India, collected by himself and never apparently seen again by anyone (King erroneously makes it a form of *C. integerrimum*). This species is very distinct in its thin spinulose leaves, in which one row of the short stamens is adnate to the sepals and the 2-seeded fruit. The foliage resembles that of *C. suffruticosa*, Ridl., but the inflorescence is totally different. Balansa describes it as \"Arbrissea\" but as far as I remember the Tanjong Malim plant which grew near the railway station, was a low, bushy tree.\n\n**MYRTACEAE.**\n\n**Tristania spathulata**, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nShrub 12 feet tall. Leaves crowded at tips of branches, oblanceolate spathulate rounded at tip or shortly blunt, acuminate base long acuminate, very narrowly decurrent on petiole, coriaceous nerves 13 pairs, faint midrib elevate beneath, 2.5 to 2.75 in. long, .75-1 in. wide, petiole slender .25 in.\nFlowers not seen. Cymes in fruit 1.5 in. long, peduncle slender. Fruit calyx cupular with short points, .1 in.; valves of capsule broad oblong .25 in. long, tips broad, rounded.\n\nPulau Battam island (Ridley 5886).\n\nThis plant was recorded in King's Materials as *T. obovata*, Bennett, a Bornean plant, a big tree with much thinner and larger leaves and much smaller fruit, the leaves quite a different shape. The only plant I have seen at all resembling *T. spathulata* is a Borneo plant collected by Motley and Haviland with small flowers, but as I have not seen fruit of these specimens and the leaves are thinner, more lanceolate and with more nerves, I refrain from considering it as the same thing.\n\n**Eugenia clypeolata**, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nA bush. Branchlets angled. Leaves ovate-cordate, blunt imbricating, stiffly coriaceous, nerves very faint about 8 pairs 1 in. long .6 in. wide, petiole .05 in. Flowers in a dense terminal head, hardly appearing above the leaves, about 20. Calyx-tube .18 in. gradually dilating from base, ribbed, lobes rounded 5, persistent. Petals small, calyptrate white. Stamens numerous, short. Style rather long and stout.\n\nPahang, Gunong Tahan on the slopes beyond the Teku river (Ridley 16022).\n\nI took this for a form of *E. Stapfiana*, but it has larger leaves quite round and cordate at the base and the flowers smaller and the calyx ribbed not pustular.\n\n**RUBIACEAE.**\n\n**Canthium congestiflorum**, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nSmall tree. Glabrous. Leaves elliptic lanceolate, rather long, acuminate, base shortly cuneate; nerves elevate beneath 5 pairs, slightly sunk above, 5 in. long, 2 in. wide, petiole .25 in. Stipules triangular, cuspidate. Flowers numerous in dense umbels .4 in. through, peduncle .1 in., pedicels as long; bracts ovate lanceolate. Calyx saucer-shaped, hardly lobed, small. Corolla coriaceous, urceolate dilate at base .12 in. long; lobes 5, thick edged valvate triangular, ovate, tube woolly, hairy below stamens. Stamens 5 in the mouth, anthers large, oblong. Style cylindric, rather stout, as long as the tube. Stigma subglobose, grooved, large. Disc low but rather thick, ovary very short.\n\nJohor, Sedenah (Ridley 13468).\n\nThe buds of this plant are resinous and the stipules very caducous. The flowers are practically umbellate with two or three ovate, lanceolate bracts, about half as long as the pedicel. It does not at all closely resemble any species known to me.\nSAPOTACEAE.\n\nChrysophyllum Curtisii, King and Gamble.\n\nThe flowers of this plant collected on Penang Hill both by Wallich and Curtis have never been described; I find, however, a specimen in flower collected by Curtis just above Grace-Dieu Bungalow on Penang Hill at 2,000 ft. altitude, \"a small tree\" in Herb. Kew. The flowers are in axillary fascicles of 3-5 on pedicels .2 in. long entirely covered, as are the sepals, with coppery hairs. Two outer sepals ovate, blunt, .1 in. long, hairy, 3 inner sepals much smaller, oblong. Corolla very short, white, lobes rounded 5, with brown streaks in centre, tube very short. Stamens minute, filaments much shorter than the ovate anthers. Ovary red, hairy. Style thick, as long as petals.\n\nThe tree seems to be peculiar to the top of Penang Hill.\n\nGESNERACEAE.\n\nDidymocarpus modesta, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nCreeping and ascending, a foot tall, pubescent, hairy all over. Leaves in subdistant pairs, oblong, shortly narrowed at both ends, blunt, .3 in. long, 1 in. wide, petiole .25 in. Flowers in the uppermost axils on slender peduncles .25 in. long or less. Calyx lobes narrow, acuminate, hairy, free nearly to base, Corolla .25 in. long, pubescent, tube cylindric, limb hardly 2-lipped; lobes short, rounded ciliate and almost minutely denticulate on the edge, white. Pistil hairy.\n\nSelangor, Ulu Gombak (Ridley) and Rantau Panjang.\n\nThis is near D. reptans var. violascens but has leaves hairy all over. Violascens too has the flowers as large as and with the projecting lower lip of D. reptans of Penang Hill, the true form, and the pedicels though not as long are longer than in D. modesta. The corolla of D. modesta however, is quite small only half as long as that of true reptans and nearly regular, the lower three lobes are indeed longer than the upper ones, but are quite similar to them, short and round. The true D. reptans of Jack, seems to be confined to Penang. The plants on the main land are the varieties monticola and violascens, which more or less run into the type of plant.\n\nACANTHACEAE.\n\nJusticia vegeta, var.\n\nThe original type of this from Gunong Mengkuang (Robinson) had large leaves and all the inflorescences axillary and .5 in. long. The plants collected by Kloss on Menuuang Gasing had a terminal spike 2-2.5 in. long. This class of Justicia usually has terminal spikes and probably this latter is more normal.\nJusticia odontites, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nSlender, erect simple herb, 2 feet tall, puberulous. Leaves in pairs 2 in. apart, lanceolate acuminate, base narrowed, nerves slender elevate beneath, 7 pairs pubescent beneath, raphides very abundant on both sides, 31.25 in. long, 1-1.25 in. wide, petiole .75 in. long, pubescent. Spike 2.35 in. long, hairy. Bracts lanceolate acute, narrowed to base, upper ones ovate or nearly rhomboid, green, hairy, .25 in. long. Flowers solitary in axils of bracts, secund. Sepals lanceolate long, acuminate, narrow, green, hairy, longer than the corolla tube. Corolla .5 in. long, hairy outside, lower limb 3-lobed, lobes rounded, apparently pink; anther cells narrow, linear, oblong one half way below the other, tailed. Pistil glabrous.\n\nJohor, Kota Tinggi (Ridley 15423). Allied to J. secundiflora, Ridl. but taller, laxer and hairy.\n\nRungia laxiflora, Clarke in the Materials, does not seem to bear any relationship to R. minutiflora or R. pectinata, Nees, but is a Justicia closely allied to the preceding.\n\nJusticia flaccida, Ridl. Journ. Roy. As. Soc. Str. Br. 57, p. 82. The name flaccida has been anticipated by Kurz. The name is therefore altered to breviflos under which name it was distributed.\n\nEranthemum crenulatum, Nees.\n\nIt is quite obvious from Nees' description in Plantae Asiaticae Rariores and Wallich's specimens that the plant intended by him under this name was what Clark named later as E. porphyranthos, and there is a good picture of the Penang Hill plant under the name crenulatum in the Botanical Register t. 279. Nees added some Indian plants to his species as varieties, and indeed they appear to be very nearly allied. Wallich's types were the fully grown form, called by Clarke var. evolutior.\n\nEranthemum graciliflorum, Nees Wall, Pl. As. Rar. 107.\n\nThis plant has been passed over by Clarke and others as unidentifiable. The specimen in Wallich's Herbarium No. 2427 was collected by George Porter by the Kosea River in Penang (I do not know where this is), but the plant though in bad condition is I think undoubtedly E. malaccensis, Clarke, with rather broader leaves than usual.\n\nEranthemum album, Nees.\n\nGiven by Clarke as from Malacca (Griffith) may be excluded from our flora. The specimens are certainly not the Indian E. album, but apparently bad specimens of E. crenulatum (porphyranthos, Clarke).\n\nR. A.

The other three species known are from Manipur and Tenasserim. This is nearest allied to *P. compressa*, Benth., from Moulmein, differing in the less pubescent bigger branches and much bigger flowers. The specimens collected by Parish, however, are young and in poor condition. The fruit of no species has been hitherto described. It resembles that of *Henslowia* in its having the seed grooved with 5 grooves which correspond to as many shortly intruded plates, but the seed is flat and rather thin, and the spaces between the grooves are rounded and not much elevated.\nMYRICACEAE.\n\nMyrica aesculenta, Buch. Ham. Gamble in the Materials for the Flora of the Malay Peninsula identifies our common Myrica with this Nepalese species, but aesculenta is described as having a fruit as big as a cherry, whereas our species has a fruit no larger than a small pea. Wallich long ago, in the Tentamen Flor. Nepal, notices the differences between the two species and describes the Singapore plant under the name of Myrica Farquhariana which is the oldest name for it. It occurs also in Banca and some plants from Sarawak seem to be identical. Gamble also makes a species from Gunong Tahan a variety under the name of var. auriculata. This is a bush with oblanceolate blunt shortly acuminate leaves, truncate and auricled at the base with strongly elevated nerves beneath, 3 in. long and 1.15 in. wide. The inflorescence and young parts are quite glabrous instead of being closely pubescent as they are in the lowland Farquhariana, and the catkins of the male flowers are on the rachis of a simple spike while the bracts are acute and longer than in that species. It seems obviously specifically distinct and I can find nothing quite like it in the herbarium at Kew. I propose to call it M. auriculata, Ridl.\n\nURTICACEAE.\n\nGironniera hirta, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nTree.

Miquelii*, as he has named specimens of it with that name, but *Miquelii* is a much smaller tree with the figs smaller and in long racemes from the lower part of the trunk. In this species the figs are borne in tubercles on the branches and on the stem and when at times completely covering and concealing the bark it forms a most striking specimen of a cauliflorous fig. The figs are largely eaten by fruit bats, chiefly *Cynopterus*, which disperse the seeds so that the plant which is never epiphytic comes up commonly in hedges, culverts, etc. It appears to be absent from Sumatra and Java.\nFicus oreophilus, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nYoung parts, petioles, midrib and nerves beneath, peduncle and figs hairy with short white hairs.

Pollinia 2, connate at top, broad semiorbicular, disc semilinar.\n\nNegri Sembilan, Siliau near Seremban (Genyns-Wil- liams).\n\nI had this plant many years ago, believed to have been found in the Taiping Hills and brought down to Singapore where it flourished and spread in the Botanic Gardens, and was known under the name of C. erectum, but Wight had utilised this name for a South Indian species or form of C. aloifolium. I appear however, to have never described it being doubtful as to its locality. Mr. Williams found it near Seremban and there was a good drawing of it among his collections of Orchid drawings. It is very distinct in its erect spike and very narrow erect leaves.\nARUNDINAS.\n\nThe genus *Arundina* is a very troublesome one as regards species as the forms seem to run into each other and though easy to distinguish in the wild state, herbarium specimens on which much has been based are very unsatisfactory as a rule, and even Lindley got the species very much mixed up.\n\n**Arundina bambusifolia**, Lindl. Bot. Reg. xxvii. Misc. 2, based on the *Cymbidium bambusifolium* of Roxburgh., is the common Indian species of which I have seen numerous specimens and Roxburgh's drawings. It is a very tall and stout species about 5-7 feet tall with large pink flowers 2-3 in. across, with the sepals and petals rather narrow, the latter not much wider than the sepals. This plant is well figured in Bot. Mag. t. 7284 and William's Orchid Album t. 139.\n\n**Arundina densa**, Lindl. Bot. Reg. xxviii. t. 38, was based on a plant sent to Loddiges by Cuming and has been accredited to Singapore as its place of origin. The specimens in Herb. Kew in Cuming's herbarium are numbered 2058, Island of Bohol in the Philippines. I have seen nothing like it from the Philippines at all and it is exactly like the superb plant from Mt. Ophir where Cuming also collected. The Mt. Ophir plant which also grows on Gunong Kerbau and other Perak hills is remarkable for the large size of the flowers, very broad ovate petals, large lip and very rich colour. It is the finest cultural species of the genus, the flowers resembling those of a *Laelia*.\n\nIt used to be much persecuted on Mt. Ophir, every one who ascended that mountain brought down bundles of it and all the best of the *Spathoglottis aurea* too till there was but little left. Besides this very fine form, we also get a smaller paler but very attractive plant on all our higher hills in the Peninsula. It specially thrives on gravelly islets in the mountain streams where it is often very plentiful. In this form the petals are much narrower than in the Ophir plant and colouring paler and the plant usually only about 3 feet tall with narrower leaves. This more resembles the Indian *bambusifolia*. It is impossible however, to separate it specifically from the Ophir form which I take to be the plant intended by Lindley as *densa*, though the figure in the Botanical Register does not do it justice. Both forms of this plant were in common cultivation in Singapore, but were not as easy to propagate as the next species, and were apt to die out after a time.\n\n**Arundina speciosa**, Bl. Bijdr. p. 401, t. 73.\n\nI was misled at one time into thinking that this was the same plant as *bambusifolia* and as I knew that a small flowered *Arundina* was very common and conspicuous in Java, and\nwas not the *A. chinensis*, Bl., I was puzzled to know how it was that Blume had not noticed this common species, but rather to my surprise I found that the big pink *bambusifolia* is entirely absent from the Malay islands, and that the common plant in Java and Borneo is the *A. speciosa* of Bl. Blume's descriptions of his two species *A. speciosa* and *A. chinensis* are too incomplete to be of much use in identification. *A. speciosa*, Bl. is a short plant usually about 2 feet tall sometimes more, with white sepals and petals and a white lip with a distinct yellow centre patch and a pink tip to the lip. The flowers are much smaller than in *A. bambusifolia*. The colouring varies a little, in the plants in Java the tip of the lip is very pale mauve, and the plants I had from Setul in the north of the Malay Peninsula, and from Sarawak are identical. The plant which grows on precipices of Kedah Peak differed in having the side lobes streaked with brown, the 2 keels on the disc were sometimes connate and the tip of the lip crimson. Very closely allied are *A. philippii* and *Megeniana* of Rchb. f. and I suppose these are the *A. chinensis*, Bl. which has puzzled everyone by Blume's statement that it has 5 keels on the lip, a thing I have seen in no *Arundina* flower. In dried specimens however, it is quite possible to mistake the outer nerves which are then visible for real keels. Blume's plant *chinensis* was, he thought, introduced from China. The Hong-Kong plant has a remarkably deep crimson broad tip to the lip, and the petals and sepals a purer white, and another difference between it and *speciosa*, Bl. is that it, like *bambusifolia*, does not produce bulbils. In *A. speciosa*, bulbils are borne on the sides of the stem especially after the flowers have been cut; these lateral buds have a swollen base about .35 in. through and a stem with leaves like the main stem. They are easily detached and pushed into the ground soon become good sized plants; so easy is the propagation of this plant that it is much the commonest in gardens in the Straits. The plants also often bear more than one raceme at the top.\n\n*A. speciosa* is not common in the Malay Peninsula. It has been obtained at Setul, and used to be abundant as a garden escape or planted on the railway banks near Kuala Lumpur. On Kedah Peak, it grows on the northern precipices, and I shall never forget my collecting it there. Just between me and it was a large patch of grassy turf, on which I was just about to step when an old Sakai or half-bred wild tribe man who accompanied me pulled me back and gave a kick to the turf which immediately slid off completely and fell about 3,000 ft. into the forest at the foot of the mountain. Had I stepped on it I should certainly have gone with it.\nArundina affinis, Griff. of the Himalayas is a small form with narrow leaves and a deep coloured lip edge, very like the Hong-Kong plant. It runs very near speciosa, Bl., and may be made a variety of that. Quite distinct and good species are A. minor, Lindl., of Ceylon, with narrow stiff erect leaves quite coriaceous and small flowers, A. revoluta, with very narrow grassy leaves and very small pink flowers, which grows by the Taiping Waterfall, and A. subsessilis, Rolfe, with small flowers in a compact head.\n\nSCITAMINEAE.\n\nGeostachys densiflora, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nRhizome stout, woody with strong woody roots; stem over 12 inches tall. Leaves narrow linear lanceolate acuminate long narrowed to the base 16-18 in. long, 1.5 in. wide, petiole .5-1 in. long, slender, ligule narrow lanceolate blunt .5 in. Scape 4 in. long, rachis and pedicels sparsely hairy. Spikes numerous crowded, .75 in. long two-flowered, peduncles .4 in. long. Bracts oblong, cuspidate. Calyx spathaceous, long cuspidate pink. Corolla lobes linear oblong, pink. Lip oblong, obovate .75 in. long, buff. Anther linear oblong crest rounded, large. Capsule (young) subglobose crowned with the calyx, ribbed red.\n\nPerak, Gunong Kerbau, 4,000 ft. (H. C. Robinson).\n\nThe dense short panicle of spikes resembles that of G. secunda but the narrow leaves, hairy rachis, and conspicuous anther crest separate it clearly.\n\nGeostachys primulina, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nLeaf stems tall. Leaves oblong lanceolate, abruptly long cuspidate, base narrowed, 12-13 in. long, 2.5 in. wide, petiole 1.5 in. long, ligule oblong .25 in., sheaths narrow 7 in. long. Scapes 3 in. long, rachis stout densely whitish hairy. Spikes numerous close set, secund 1.5 in. long. Bracts at base ovate ribbed, upper ones larger imbricating. Peduncles very short .1 in. densely hairy. Flowers 2 in a spike, outer bracts oblong cuspidate. Calyx .5 in. long, spathaceous, cuspidate. Corolla .75 in. long, primrose yellow. Anther crestless.\n\nSelangor, Semangkok Pass (Ridley 12029). A much more succulent plant than the other species with broader leaves, and hairy rachis and peduncles.\n\nPALMAE.\n\nLicuala Wrayi, Becc. MS.\n\nPalm 5 feet tall. Leaf 7-lobed, central lobe obtuse 14 in. long, + in. wide at top, teeth short and blunt, .25 in. long, side lobes narrower, the lowest .75 in. wide linear, hard-\nly narrowed to base, petiole rather slender triquetrous 3 ft. 6 in. long thorny half-way, thorns short, hooked. Spadix, peduncle 22 in. long, slender with a long 10 in. papery sheath at base and 2 shorter above with lanceolate acute limb. Inflorescence and free part of peduncle 3 in. long, woolly. Spikes terminal, rachis thick, woolly, the spikes 5, crowded towards top 3 in. long. Flowers white, sessile, on small tubercles, calyx .12 in. long, cylindric, base dilate, slightly dilate upwards, globes irregular pubescent. Petals lanceolate acuminate nearly as long, glabrous. Staminal ring free from corolla, lobes acute.\n\nPerak, Gunong Bubu (Wray) at 4,500 ft. No. 3918.\n\nBeccari named this in Herb. Kew but did not publish it. It is remarkable for the long papery spathes and long peduncled velvety tomentose inflorescence, the spikes crowded at the top. It is closely allied to L. modesta.\n\nLicuala patens, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nStem up to 10 feet tall, 3-5 in. through. Leaves 2-3 feet across; leaflets obcuneate, linear, numerous, 21 in. long, 1.5 in. wide, subequal, teeth 4, broad acuminate .75 in. long, petiole 6-8 feet long, sparsely thorny at base, back rounded, edges sharp .5 in. through. Spadix 3-4 feet long, spathes flattened 12 in. long (the lowest) .75 in. wide, lacerate. Panicles of about 16 spikes, base wide spreading 6-8 in. long, rather slender puberulous with distant flowers. Calyx small, campanulate .05 in. quite entire at first, later with short ovate lobes, all hairy. Corolla very short, glabrous. Fruit \"white,\" oblong globose, peduncled by the persistent calyx and corolla.\n\nPerak, Gunong Bubu (Kunstler 7339) (Wray 3928) 2,500-4,000 ft.\n\nBeccari refers this to L. paludosa, and it certainly resembles that species, but the large spreading panicles 18 in. across, and the hairy flowers distinguish it at once. L. paludosa is a plant of lowland watery woods, growing in water. This plant is a mountain species.\n\nCYPERACEAE.\n\nCarex breviglumis, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nLeaves long, very slender acuminate ending in a long narrow point, 2 feet long, .25 in. wide, edges scabrid. Culm as long slender, partial panicles narrow, remote 3-4, about 1 in. long on slender peduncles. Male portion narrow short. Female glumes ovate truncate embracing utricle at base, awned, awn scabrid, keeled to base hardly half as long as the utricle, pale greenish. Utricle ellipsoid lanceolate narrow\nstrong and several less conspicuous ribs on each face, scabrid, and short hairy on edges, .2 in. long. Style short, red trifid nut dark brown, narrow lanceolate triquetrous, narrowed abruptly at both ends.\n\nPahang, Telom Forests at 4,000 feet (Ridley 12865).\n\nGRAMINEAE.\n\nIsachne Kunthiana, var. denticulata, Ridl. n. var.\n\nStiff plant with stout woody stems 2-5 in. tall. Leaves crowded coriaceous lanceolate acuminate ribbed 1.10 in. long, .24 in. wide, edges and back when young ciliate, after the fall of the hairs minutely denticulate, sheaths ciliate, culm 4 in. long, glabrous, branches of panicle 5 or 6, the lowest 1 in. long. Spikelets about 9 on the lower ones shortly or not pedicelled. Glumes i. and ii., lanceolate ribbed purple. Glumes iii. and iv. shorter pubescent.\n\nGunong Kerbau at 6,600 feet (Robinson); also Borneo, Mt. Kinabalu 8,000 feet (Haviland); Ceylon, (Thwaites 3754).\n\nThe ordinary form of I. Kunthiana here is a weak slender plant with thin stems soft leaves and short slender panicle of very short branches, the lowest half an inch, the outer glumes pubescent. This variety I take to be a mountain form of it. The Kinabalu plant is intermediate in its thin elongate stems.\n\nIsachne javanica var. saxicola, Ridl., Fed. Mal. States Mus. Journ. vi. p. 196, must I think be considered a form of Kunthiana. It has the stiff leaves of the preceding variety but almost glabrous and not toothed, the panicle is that of I. Kunthiana, typical but glabrous.\n\nChrysopogon collinum, Ridl. n. sp.\n\n3-4 feet tall. Stem fairly stout nodes glabrous, branched. Leaves linear acuminate 9 in. long, .25 in. wide, glabrous minutely thorny on nerves and edge at tip. Panicle shortly protruding from uppermost leaf 3 in. long; rachis slender, minutely hairy. Pedicels hairy in edge. Callus with a short tuft of brownish hairs. Spikelets .25 in. long. Glume i., lanceolate, narrow shortly hairy on nerves and edge, awn slender about as long. Glume ii., similar, awned edges with long white hairs. Glume iii., shorter very thin sparse hairy, acuminate. Awn on glume iv., slender .75 in. long base dark brown above, pale minutely sparsely pubescent.\n\nSetul Bukit Wang (Haniff 649).\n\nAllied to C. Wightianus, Nees, but the spikelets smaller and altogether less hairy, the awns are under an inch long and nearly glabrous, while those of C. Wightianus are 2 inches long, stout and conspicuously hairy.\nSchizostachyum grande, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nCulms 60 feet tall, 3 inches through, internodes 2-3 feet long, walls thin. Sheaths over 12 inches long covered with white hairs in fascicles between the nerves; leaves very stiff almost coriaceous, oblong with a somewhat abrupt point; base round, narrowed very shortly to the broad petiole, blades smooth, midrib very prominent edge very minutely serrulate or smooth, nerves 28, petiole .5 in. long, .15 in. wide, sheaths flattened; ligule rather large, not bristly. Panicle 12 inches long. Spikelets crowded in tufts .5\u20141 in. apart. Bracts short, ovate; spikelets very slender .5 in. long, glumes lanceolate mucronate strongly ribbed, glabrous. Palea lanceolate acuminate. Lodicules two oblong, lanceolate tip white, ciliate. Stamen anthers shortly apiculate.\n\nSelangor, Semangkok Pass (Ridley 8457, 12043); (Machado 11591); (Curtis 3475) Ginting Bidai (Ridley 7787).\n\nThis very fine bamboo forms the greater part of the bamboo forest at the Semangkok Pass. Gamble in Herb. Kew suggested it was his S. latifolium based on a plant from Kota Glanggi, a much smaller plant with ciliate glumes. Another plant which he has also written up in Herb. Kew as S. latifolia is certainly S. longispiculata, Kurz, a Javanese Bamboo with very slender stems and much smaller softer leaves. It occurs at Pahang, Kuala Lipis (Machado 11592 and 11593); Selangor, Ginting Bidai (Ridley 7788); Dindings (Ridley 10322 and 8389).\n\nSchizostachyum subcordatum, Ridl. n. sp.\n\nBranches slender. Leaves lanceolate acuminate; base broad subcordate 5-6 in. long, .75 in. wide, midrib slender; petiole very short; ligule very short, no bristles. Panicles simple, numerous in whorls or terminal on leafy branches 3-4 in. long of 7 or 8 clusters of spikelets crowded towards the tip. Bracts ovate mucronate with three ribs from the tip, polished; spikelets very short .15 in. long. Glumes lanceolate smooth. Palea thin, lanceolate acute. Lodicules 0.\n\nSelangor, Semangkok Pass (Ridley 8482). Allied to S. chilianthum but differing notably in the narrow lanceolate nearly cordate auricled leaves, and the very small crowded spikelets, which on one spike are crowded into a dense mass 1 in. long. The whole plant appears to be perfectly glabrous.\nNew Records and Species of Malayan Membracidae.\n\nW. D. Funkhouser.\n\n(Contribution from the Zoological Laboratory of the University of Kentucky).\n\nIn a previous paper record was made of an interesting collection of Membracidae taken by Professor C. F. Baker of Los Banos, P. I., at Singapore and on the Island of Penang during the Summer of 1917.\n\nMore recent collecting by Professor Baker has yielded additional new records and species from the Peninsula and from Borneo which are of particular value in adding to our knowledge of the distribution of the species of this family of insects. A comparison of the list of genera and species here recorded with those described from the more distant parts of the mainland and with those inhabiting the Philippine Islands and Ceylon brings out some very suggestive data regarding the extents of faunal areas throughout the East Indies which will be of interest to the zoogeographer.\n\nAll of the species here listed were collected by Professor Baker to whom I am indebted for the opportunity of studying the material.\n\n1. Centrochares borneensis Distant.\n\n1916. Centrochares borneensis Dist. Rhynchotal Notes p. 314.\n\nOne male and two females from Sandakan, Borneo. This species is very close to C. horrificus Westwood but differs in size, slightly in color, and in the shorter and differently shaped pronotal horns.

Centrotypus brunneus sp. nov. (Figs. 1 and 2).\n\nA large robust species, entirely brown; roughly punctate; sparingly pubescent; suprahumeral horns very sharp, extending outward and curving upward; posterior process long, slender, sharply carinate above and extending to a point about midway between internal angle and tip of tegmen; tegmina entirely brown, wrinkled, sparsely pilose, coarsely punctate at base; legs and undersurface of body brown.\n\nHead subquadrangular, wider than long, entirely and uniformly brown, roughly sculptured, coarsely punctate, sparingly pubescent with grayish hairs; base of head convex above, highest above ocelli; eyes very large, very prominent, grayish-brown, extending beyond lateral margins of adjoining pronotum; ocelli very large, grayish-brown, farther from each other than from the eyes and situated somewhat above a line passing through centres of eyes; clypeus heavy, brown, roughly sculptured, punctate, sparsely pubescent with grayish hairs twice as long as wide, extending for more than two-thirds its length below the inferior margins of the genae, the tip subtruncate and almost as wide as the base, lateral margins slightly expanded just below inferior line of head.\n\nPronotum entirely brown, roughly punctate, sparingly pubescent with grayish hairs; metopidium nearly perpendicular, very slightly convex above, three irregular smooth callosities on each side above lateral margins of head; humeral angles large, prominent, auriculate; suprahumeral horns sharp, curved, projecting at first nearly horizontally as seen from the front and then distinctly curving upward, about as long as the distance between their bases, flattened dorso-ventrally, irregularly rugose above, bicarinate below, tips slightly bent backwards, distinct depression on each side between base of horn and base of humeral angle; median carina percurrent, sharply ridged behind suprahumeral horns; dorsum sloping, only slightly gibbous before base of posterior process; scutellum distinctly exposed on each side, brown; posterior process long, slender, nearly straight, very slightly sinuate above, somewhat decurved at tip, dorsal carina high and sharp, a strong lateral carina on each side at base extending from behind base of suprahumeral horn to lateral margin of process about one-third the distance from the tip, tip acuminate, extending beyond the tip of the abdomen and to a point about half-way between the internal angle and the apex of the tegmen.\n\nTegmina entirely brown, wrinkled, semi-translucent; veins more or less curved in central area; basal half coarsely punctured and sparingly pilose with grayish hairs; five apical and three discoidal areas. Hind wings hyaline, veins blackish, four apical areas.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 82, 1920.\nUndersurface of body brown, sides of mesothorax covered with dense golden pubescence, abdomen darker. Legs brown, tips of tarsi and claws darker, nearly black on the posterior pair.\n\nLength 8 mm.; width between tips of suprathumeral horns 6 mm.\n\nType: female.\nLocality: Sandakan, Borneo.\nUnique type in Professor Baker's collection.\n\n9. Micreune macularum Buckton.\n\n1903. Micreune macularum Buckt. Mon. Memb. p. 213, Pl. 47, Figs. 7, 7a, 7b.\n\nOne female (Baker's duplicate No. 9507) taken at Sandakan, Borneo. This specimen agrees in all respects with Buckton's description and figures. Since the type was described from Borneo I have no doubt but that Professor Baker has here discovered for the species the first new record since its original description.\n\n10.

The unique type of the species came from Singapore and it is most gratifying to find additional specimens as well as a new locality recorded.\n\n13. **Anchonoides serpentinus** sp. nov. (Figs. 3 and 4).\n\nEntirely black with meagre white pubescence; posterior process very strongly sinuate, apex suddenly acute; suprathumeral horns horizontal, very thin and sharp; scutellum entirely exposed; tegmina hyaline with brown veins on apical three-fourths, basal fourth black, coriaceous and punctate, second costal cell from the base black, coriaceous, punctate and pubescent; undersurface of body black; legs black with yellowish bands on second and third tibiae and tarsi.\n\nHead subquadrangular, about as long as wide, black, roughly sculptured, finely punctate, densely pubescent with whitish hairs; base sinuously convex; eyes large, prominent, brown; ocelli large, dark brown, farther from each other than from the eyes and situated slightly above an imaginary line drawn through centres of eyes; clypeus twice as long as wide, projecting for two-thirds its length below the inferior margins of the genae, black, finely punctate, densely pubescent with sordid-white hairs, tip truncate, lateral margins sinuate; inferior margins of genae having a slight angle on each side about one-third the distance from the clypeus.\n\nPronotum black, finely punctate, longitudinally striate with grayish-white pubescence; metopidium sloping, punctate, with five longitudinal stripes of whitish pubescence, one extending down median line, one on each side just above suprathumeral horn and another on each side between bases of suprathumeral horns and humeral angles, smooth callosity above each eye; humeral angles prominent and blunt; suprathumeral horns very thin and sharp, arising from a point about midway between the crest of the dorsum and the humeral angles and extending directly outward; median carina weakly percurrent; posterior process very strongly sinuate, one high loop just above the scutellum, another just above internal angle of tegmen, both loops high and bearing lateral carinae, the posterior loop much swollen, tip suddenly acuminate, slender, sharp, extending far beyond the abdomen and almost reaching apex of tegmen; scutellum entirely exposed black, punctate, sparingly pubescent, the base upraised and swollen, the tip strongly bidentate.\n\nTegmina hyaline for apical three-fourths; base black, coriaceous and punctured; internal angle and apical margin brown; veins distinctly nodulate in central area and strongly brown in apical area; second cell from the base on the costal margin very strongly and sharply black, coriaceous, punctate and pubescent.\n\nR. A. Soc., No. 82, 1920.\nUndersurface of thorax uniformly black, irregularly pubescent with white hairs. Abdomen ringed with white and black; the two apical segments black, the next four segments white, the next segment black, the next segment white and the basal segments black, the white segments irregularly but strongly punctate with black dots; the colors of the abdomen easily described through the hyaline portions of the wings.\n\nLegs black with the exception of the basal joints of the tarsi which are white or yellowish and a broad luteous band near the apices of the tibiae of the last two pairs of legs. Tibiae minutely spined and nodulate. Claws strong and black.\n\nLength 6 mm.; width between tips of suprahumeral horns 4 mm.; length of each suprahumeral horn 1 mm.\n\nType: female (Baker's duplicate No. 9825).\n\nLocality: Sandakan, Borneo.\n\nType in author's collection.\n\nThis is a very striking and distinct species and should be at once recognized by the strongly bisinuate posterior process, the slender suprahumeral horns and the black cell of the tegmen.\n\n14. Tricentrus pronus Distant.\n\n1916. *Tricentrus pronus* Dist. Fauna Brit. Ind. App. p. 166, No. 3368.\n\nTwo specimens, both females, from the Island of Penang. This species is close to *T. gibbosulus* Walk., but differs in the shape and direction of the suprahumeral horns.\n\n15. Tricentrus allabens Distant.\n\n1916. *Tricentrus allabens* Dist. Fauna Brit. Ind. App. p. 166, No. 3367.\n\nTwo females, one from the Island of Penang and one (Baker's duplicate No. 9826) from Sandakan, Borneo. In the Borneo specimen the horns are sharper and slightly more recurved than in the specimen from Penang; it agrees more closely with Distant's original description and figure. The Penang specimen may be a variety but I should not like to separate it on the basis of a single specimen. Both specimens have the characteristic white transverse fascia following the black basal area of the tegmen.\n\n16. Tricentrus truncaticornis Funkhouser.\n\nAdd\u2014Locality: Sandakan, Borneo.\n\nOne male specimen. This is without doubt the male of *T. truncaticornis* and is the first record for the sex. The species was described from a female from Singapore with which type specimen the Borneo insect has been compared.\n17. **Tricentrus albomaculatus** Distant.\n\nThree females, one from the Island of Penang (Baker's duplicate No. 9388) and two (one bearing Baker's duplicate No. 9406) from Singapore. This species has been previously reported from both these localities\\(^1\\) as well as from other parts of South India\\(^2\\) and is apparently common throughout the Peninsula.\n\n18. **Tricentrus brunneus** Funkhouser.\n\n*Add\u2014Localities: Sandakan, Borneo; Island of Penang.*\n\nTwo specimens, both females. It is interesting to note that this species was described from a female from Singapore\\(^3\\) and that the male has never been recorded. The suprakumeral horns in the Borneo specimen are slightly longer than in the type specimen but I can find no specific differences.\n\n19. **Tricentrus assamensis** Distant.\n\nOne male (Baker's duplicate No. 9403) from Singapore. The species which I am determining as *assamensis* is apparently subject to considerable variation and has a wide range. It has previously been reported from Singapore\\(^4\\); Distant records it from Assam\\(^5\\) and I have a series from Teppakulam collected by the Rev. L. V. Newton in 1915. The variation shown in the specimens from different districts is chiefly in size and I can find no characters which would warrant the splitting of the species in the material at my disposal.\n\n20. **Tricentrus repandus** Distant.\n\n1916. *Tricentrus repandus* Dist. Fauna Brit. Ind. App. p. 163, No. 3362.\n\nTwo females, one from Sandakan, Borneo, and one from the Island of Penang.

Since this species was originally described from Hindustan\\(^1\\) and has since been recorded from Darjeeling (Mann), Calcutta and Tenasserim (Doherty)\\(^2\\), it apparently has a wide range. The specimens from the Singapore region seem to answer fully the original description by Walker and the more recent description by Distant and if they are not *congestus* they are so near it that it would be unwise to consider them as new and they must accordingly be placed temporarily at least under this species.\n\n**22.

(Figs. 7 and 8).\n\nSmall, black; suprathumeral horns very small; posterior process heavy, short, extending just to interior angle of tegmen; tegmina dark brown with white spot at apical angle and with the base black, coriaceous and punctate; trochanters, femora and proximal ends of tibiae black; distal ends of tibiae ferruginous; tarsi and claws flavous.\n\nHead wider than long, entirely black, finely punctate, sparsely pubescent; base sinuate; eyes large, prominent, brown; ocelli very conspicuous, shining, translucent, luteous, somewhat farther from each other than from the eyes and situated slightly above a line drawn through centres of eyes; inferior margins of genae sinuate; clypeus longer than wide, much reflexed, extending for about half its length below inferior margins of genae, black, punctate, tip slightly pilose.\n\nPronotum entirely black, coarsely punctate, very sparingly pubescent with weak short hairs; metopidium convex, broader than high, coarsely punctate; median carina strongly percurrent over both metopidium and posterior process; humeral angles large, prominent, extending laterad farther than the suprathumeral horns; suprathumeral horns very small and short, wider than high, flattened dorso-ventrally, hardly more conspicuous than a large carina would be and resembling more a fold than a horn, extending outward and upward but not reaching as far laterad as the humeral angles below them, about as far, in fact, as the lateral margins of the eyes and not extending much higher than the crest of the dorsum; scutellum plainly exposed on each side, black, punctate, sparingly pubescent; posterior process short, heavy, entirely black, coarsely punctate, not pubescent, strongly ridged above, tip slightly upraised and extending just to the internal angle of the tegmen.\n\nTegmina dark brown, wrinkled; base black, coriaceous and punctate; small area around internal angle white and subhyaline; veins prominent and black; five apical and two discoidal areas.\n\nUndersurface of body entirely black; ventral segments of thorax finely punctate; sides of mesothorax and metathorax sparingly pubescent.\n\nLegs black with the distal extremities of the tibiae ferruginous and the tarsi and claws luteous or flavous.

The genus Centrotoscelus is separated from Tricentrus chiefly by the fact that in the former genus the suprhumeral horns are absent. The species of Tricentrus here described as brevicornis has the smallest and least conspicuous suprhumerals of any species of that genus hitherto reported.\n\n27. Sipylus dilatatus Walker.\n\nAdd\u2014Locality: Sandakan, Borneo.\n\nTwo males and one female from Borneo, the males bearing respectively Baker's duplicate Nos. 9401 and 9531.\n\nThis species is apparently widely distributed throughout the East Indies. Specimens in my collection from the Philippines have been compared by Mr. W. L. Distant with Walker's type in the British Museum and pronounced identical. The Borneo material agrees in every respect with the Philippine forms, as do also specimens previously collected by Professor Baker at Singapore. The species is easily recognized by the triangular pronotum, the absence of spines on the trochanters and the very nodulate veins of the tegmina.\n\n28. Centrotoscelus borneensis sp. nov. (Figs. 9 and 10).\n\nPronotum rich ferruginous-brown, finely punctate, closely pubescent with silvery hairs; tegmina ferruginous-hyaline, base dark brown and punctate, tip brown; no suprhumeral horns; posterior process extending just beyond internal angles of tegmina; undersurface of body dark brown; legs ferruginous; hind trochanters armed on internal surface with strong teeth.\n\nHead about as long as wide, dark brown, the fine punctuation almost entirely hidden by the dense silvery pubescence; base of head convex, very weakly sinuate; eyes large, prominent, light brown; ocelli large, prominent, glassy, about twice as far from each other as from the eyes and situated well above a line drawn through centres of eyes; inferior margins of genae weakly sinuate, reflexed, sloping downward from eyes to margins of clypeus; clypeus longer than wide, much deflexed, brown, punctate, pubescent, tip-rounded and flanged.\n\nPronotum uniform ferruginous-brown, finely punctate, pubescent with silvery hairs; metopidium broader than high, rich brown punctate, pubescent, slight callosity over inner angle of each eye, not carinate in centre; humeral angles large, prominent, blunt, dorsum convex over humeral angles, depressed over scutellum, straight on posterior process; median carina not percurrent, plainly indicated on\nposterior process but obsolete over anterior half of pronotum; scutellum exposed on each side, brown, punctate, sparingly pubescent; posterior process straight, heavy, blunt, carinate above, tip extending barely beyond internal angle of tegmen.\n\nTegmina ferruginous, subtranslucent, wrinkled, iridescent; base dark brown, coriaceous, punctate, pubescent; apical margin and about one-fourth of apical cells marked with brown, region of internal angle lighter in color than the rest of the tegmen; veins heavy, dark brown; five apical and two discoidal cells, the venation agreeing with that of the genus Tricentrus.\n\nUndersurface of body very dark brown; sides of thorax finely punctate and closely pubescent; trochanters and femora dark brown, tibiae and tarsi ferruginous; hind trochanters strongly armed with teeth on internal surface.\n\nLength 4.8 mm.; width between extremities of humeral angles 2.6 mm.\n\nType: female (Baker's duplicate No. 9520).\n\nLocality: Sandakan, Borneo.\n\nType in author's collection: paratype in Professor Baker's collection.\n\n29. Centrotoscelus brevispinis sp. nov. (Figs. 11 and 12).\n\nNear the preceding but larger and differing in the shape and length of the posterior process and in the maculations of the tegmina.\n\nLarge and robust; head black; pronotum brown, punctate, pubescent; no suprahumeral horns; posterior process short, sharp, tricarinate, tip acute and extending just to the internal angles of the tegmina; tegmina smoky hyaline, base black, veins of central area black and upraised; undersurface of body dark brown; tibiae and tarsi ferruginous.\n\nHead black, coarsely punctate, sparingly pubescent, wider than long, roughly sculptured; base sinuate; eyes large, prominent, dark brown; ocelli prominent, somewhat elevated, yellowish, somewhat farther from each other than from the eyes and situated slightly above a line drawn through centres of eyes; inferior margins of genae weakly sinuate, slightly protruding; clypeus black, punctate, pilose with yellowish hairs, longer than wide, extending for more than half its length below inferior margins of genae, tip truncate and densely pilose.\n\nPronotum dark ferruginous-brown except just above the head where the color is much darker, finely punctate, rather densely pubescent; metopidium sloping, a little wider than high, black on lower third and brown above, an irregular callosity above internal angle of each eye, no central carina; humeral angles large, prominent, triangular, blunt; dorsum convex above humeral angles, sloping before posterior process; scutellum largely exposed on\nboth sides, very densely pubescent with yellowish or golden hairs; posterior process short, nearly straight, strongly tricarinate with a median ridge above and a lateral ridge on each side just above lateral margin, extreme tip very sharp, black, extending just to internal angle of tegmen.\n\nTegmina smoky-hyaline tinged with ferruginous; somewhat wrinkled, especially on the rather broad apical margin; base black, coriaceous, coarsely punctate, sparingly pubescent; costal margin of apex very narrowly and faintly marked with light brown; veins in central area of tegmina very heavy, upraised and black; a rather narrow transverse area just following coriaceous base lighter than other parts of tegmen; five apical and two discoidal cells.\n\nUndersurface of body very dark brown, rather closely pubescent with silvery hairs; coxae, trochanters and femora dark brown; tibiae and tarsi ferruginous; tibiae minutely spined and pilose; hind trochanters strongly armed with teeth on the inner surface.\n\nLength 5.7 mm.; width between extremities of humeral angles 2.8 mm.\n\nType: female.\nLocality: Sandakan, Borneo.\nType (Baker's duplicate No. 9512) in author's collection; allotype and paratype in Professor Baker's collection.\n\nOne tegmen of the type specimen shows three discoidal cells instead of two, a variation not unusual in the tegmina of the subfamily Centrotinae and an evidence of the fact that the number of discoidal cells is not a reliable character for specific diagnosis.\n\n30. Centrotoscelus pseudocornis sp. nov. (Figs. 13 and 14).\n\nSmall, black, with slight protuberances which resemble horns above the humeral angles; posterior process just reaching internal angles of tegmina; tegmina smoky-hyaline except base which is black and punctate; tibiae and tarsi ferruginous.\n\nHead wider than long, black, roughly sculptured, densely pubescent with silvery hairs; base strongly sinuate; eyes large, prominent, brown; ocelli small, brown, glassy somewhat farther from each other than from the eyes and situated slightly above a line drawn through centres of eyes; inferior margins of genae sloping, weakly sinuate, flanged; antennae very fine but visible; clypeus about twice as long as wide, black, densely pubescent, projecting for half its length below inferior margins of genae, tip rounded and pilose.\n\nPronotum black, finely punctate, closely pubescent with silvery hairs; metopidium convex, broader than high, a black callosity over the internal angle of each eye, barely carinate on inferior half; humeral angles large, prominent, triangular, blunt; a strong ridge suggesting an undeveloped horn above each humeral angle; median carina strong on posterior half of pronotum, weak over humeral angles and almost obsolete on metopidium; scutellum plainly ex-\nposed on each side; posterior process short, heavy, tectiform, median dorsal ridge high, tip blunt and just reaching internal angles of tegmina.\n\nTegmina smoky-hyaline, tinged with ferruginous; smooth in central region but wrinkled in apical region; base black, coriaceous, finely punctate, sparingly pubescent; veins of central costal area heavy and brown; five apical and two discoidal cells.\n\nUndersurface of body black, punctate and pubescent; sides of abdominal segments grayish with sharp black punctures; coxae, trochanters and basal half of femora black; distal half of femora lighter; tibiae and tarsi ferruginous; hind trochanters armed on inner surface with strong teeth.\n\nLength 4.3 mm.; width between tips of humeral angles 2.3 mm.\n\nType: male (Baker's duplicate No. 9384).\n\nLocality: Island of Penang.\n\nType in author's collection.\n\nThis species is most interesting in that it shows a tendency to a transition towards the genus Tricentrus. It very closely approaches Tricentrus brevicornis described above (No. 26) and might be placed in the same genus as the latter species if the suprahuneral ridges were somewhat more prominent. In general facies, however, Centrotoscelus pseudocornis has more affinities towards Centrotoscelus than towards Tricentrus and must be placed for the present in the former genus. It may be that additional forms from these two genera will show that the presence or absence of suprahuneral horns will not constitute a sufficient generic character as has hitherto been supposed.\n\nOne male from the Island of Penang.\n\n32. Gargara projecta Funkhouser.\n\nOne male and two females from the Island of Penang. As in the type material from Singapore, the male is somewhat smaller and darker than the female but is easily identified by the projecting head and clypeus. One female bears Baker's duplicate No. 9393 and the male the duplicate No. 9396. The species has already been reported from the Island of Penang.1\n\n33. Gargara attenuata Funkhouser.\n\n1914.

One female from the Island of Penang bears Baker's duplicate No. 9392. The male from Borneo is numbered 9832 and the female 9831. This species was described from Banguey; the specimens here recorded agree in all respects with the type material with which they have been compared.\n\n---\n\n1. Journ Straits Branch R. A.

I have never recognized Distant's variety *nandidrugana* which he states may be a distinct species.\n\n48. *Gargara pilinervosa* sp. nov.\n\nSmall, dark brown, finely punctate, densely pubescent; posterior process not reaching internal angles of tegmina; tegmina hyaline, base black, transverse brown fascia across central area, veins very strongly pilose and somewhat nodulate; undersurface of body brown; femora brown, tibiae and tarsi luteous.\n\nHead wider than long, the black color and fine punctuation almost entirely hidden by the very dense silvery pubescence; base strongly sinuate; eyes large, prominent, grayish-brown; ocelli small, pearly, at least twice as far from each other as from the eyes and situated well above a line drawn through centres of eyes; inferior margins of genae sloping, sinuate; antennae long, prominent; clypeus longer than wide, black, punctate, very densely pubescent, extending for about half its length below inferior margins of genae, tip rounded, flanged and sparingly pilose.\n\nPronotum dark brown, punctate, very densely pubescent with silvery hairs especially over anterior half; metopidium wider than high, sloping, slightly convex along median line; humeral angles large, prominent, triangular, auriculate, blunt; median carina faintly percurrent, strong on posterior process but almost obsolete on metopidium; dorsum weakly convex, slightly depressed above scutellum; scutellum plainly exposed on both sides, punctate, pubescent; posterior process short, heavy, blunt, strongly ridged above, somewhat lighter in color than the rest of the pronotum, extending only a short distance beyond scutellum and not nearly reaching the internal angles of the tegmina.\n\nTegmina hyaline except at base which is black, coriaceous, punctate and pubescent; across the central area is a transverse brown fascia extending from the internal angle and becoming grad-\nually wider until it reaches the costal margin; veins very strongly pilose throughout and slightly nodulate near base; five apical and two discoidal cells.\n\nUndersurface of body dark brown or black.

(Fig. 15).\n\nShining black; tegmina with three long and one very short white fasciae and four large apical cells; posterior process strongly sinuate and not nearly reaching to internal angles of tegmina; ocelli very much farther from each other than from the eyes; undersurface of body black; legs dark brown.\n\nHead very convex, about as long as broad, black, shining, punctate, very sparingly pubescent at lateral basal angles; eyes large, prominent, yellowish-white with brown markings near inner margins; ocelli small but very prominent, yellowish, glassy, glistening, very much farther from each other than from the eyes and situated near the lateral margins of the head somewhat above a line drawn through centres of eyes; inferior margins of genae short and nearly straight; clypeus much deflexed, convex, black, shining, finely punctate, extending for two-thirds its length below the inferior margins of the genae, tip rounded, somewhat swollen, sparingly pubescent.\n\nPronotum entirely black, finely punctate, shining, very faintly pubescent; metopidium sloping, broader than high, slightly depressed above eyes, black, shining, finely punctate; humeral angles very broad, prominent, auriculate, blunt; dorsum strongly sinuate, a depression just behind humeral angles and another in centre of posterior process, between these depressions much swollen; median dorsal carina very faintly percurrent; posterior process short, heavy, blunt, a swollen elevation at base and at tip, faintly carinate along median dorsal line, tip rounded and not nearly reaching internal angles of tegmina; scutellum not exposed when tegmina are closed.\n\nTegmina black, opaque, shining; base coriaceous and punctate; veins noticeably pilose; four shining white linear fasciae extending across the tegmen at various angles as follows: one very short white line extending from centre of margin of posterior process across the clavus caudo-ventrad to the fold of the corium; another white line extending entirely across the tegmen diagonally from the tip of the posterior process cephalo-ventrad to the costal margin near the edge of the basal punctuation; another wider white line beginning on the costal margin about two-thirds of the distance from the base and extending cephalo-dorsad about half-way across the tegmen; another broad white fascia extending across the tip of the tegmen just inside the apical veins. The tegmen has four large apical cells and two discoidal.\nUndersurface of body entirely black; sides of metathorax thickly white tomentose; legs uniformly dark brown.\n\nLength 3.4 mm.; width between tips of humeral angles 1.7 mm.\n\nType: female.\n\nLocality: Sandakan, Borneo.\n\nUnique type in Professor Baker's collection.\n\nIn erecting the genus *Parayasa*, Distant gives as one of the generic characters the position of the ocelli as about equidistant from each other and from the eyes. This is certainly not the case in the species here described, although I believe it unquestionably belongs to the genus as designated. I think, also, that the fact that the scutellum is not exposed in the insects of this genus should be stated as an aid to identification.\n\nEXPLANATION OF PLATE.\n\nFig. 1.
