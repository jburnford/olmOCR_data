Brandreth, Esq.\n\nIn the Address delivered by him at the Second International Congress of Orientalists, in 1874, Prof. Max M\u00fcller remarks, \"No real advance has been made in the classification of the Non-Aryan Indian dialects since the time when I endeavoured, some twenty years ago, to sum up what was then known on that subject in my letter to Bunsen, 'On the Turanian Languages.'\" A table of the Indian languages is given by Max M\u00fcller in that most popular work of his, eight editions of which have already been published, the Lectures on the Science of Language. A very few lines are devoted to these languages in the Lectures: for further particulars we are referred to the above-mentioned letter on the Turanian languages. Some important materials, however, for the study of the Indian languages, have been collected since that letter was published; and it is evident that, if Max M\u00fcller had had those materials before him, he would have written about the languages of India in some respects very differently. He would not, for instance, have remarked, regarding that enormous number of languages on our northern and eastern frontiers which he calls Sub-Himalayan and Lohitic, that, \"with the exception of the Naga dialects, none distinguishes the persons of the verb by either affixes or prefixes;\" because many other languages besides the Naga do thus distinguish the persons of the verb, and in some of them the structure of the verb is of the most com-\nand, further, though we have not, as yet, materials for making anything but a provisional classification of these languages, yet one or two of what appear to me to be errors in Max M\u00fcller's classification may be corrected. Sarpa, for instance, is a mere dialect of Tibetan, and Changlo is very closely related; and yet Tibetan, Sarpa, and Changlo are all three placed in separate subdivisions. Burmese again, which is not classed with Tibetan, is certainly more like Tibetan than it is to some of the languages, such as Dhimal and Kachari, with which it is classed. Further, I think a more detailed classification than Max M\u00fcller's may with advantage be adopted, by dividing these languages into subclasses based upon differences of verbal structure or other characteristics.\n\nMy object in this paper is to give a brief sketch of the different groups into which the non-Aryan languages of India may be formed, derived from more recent materials than those which were available to Max M\u00fcller. These materials are described by Mr. Cust in certain communications made by him to the Philological Society, and published in the two last Annual Reports of that Society. Some of the books referred to he procured from India, as they were not to be had in this country. Another object I have in view is, to call attention to the very little that, after all, is known of most of these Indian languages, in the hope that, if the necessity for further investigation is prominently noticed by such a Society as the Asiatic, scholars in India may be moved to do something to that end. It is not to our credit that so little on the whole should be known of the languages spoken by our non-Aryan fellow-subjects in India, or by those non-Aryans on the immediate frontiers of British India with whom our officers are frequently brought in contact. The Dravidian group, as was to be expected from its importance, has received the most attention; yet, even here, much remains to be done. It is supposed that this group extends almost continuously from Cape Comorin to the Ganges. The most northerly member of the group is supposed to be the Rajmahali; but we have only a very meagre vocabulary of the language, and\nthough it is spoken within a few hours' rail of Calcutta, we know nothing whatever of its grammar. Much less attention has been paid to the other South-Indian group, the Kolarian. Of the Savara, for instance,\u2014the Sabaree of Ptolemy, a language which was considered of sufficient importance to be marked by a separate colour on the language map which accompanies the Madras Census Report,\u2014we have only a very imperfect vocabulary. From this vocabulary it appears probable, but by no means certain, that the Savara belongs to the Kolarian group; but no sketch has been vouchsafed of its grammar. Of most of the other languages also of this group it is very little that we know. Of the numerous languages, again, on our northern and eastern frontiers, there is not one in twenty of the grammar of which we know anything at all.\n\nThe language map which accompanies this paper has been prepared from the best information I could get up to the present time, though doubtless the boundaries and positions of the languages are not in all cases exactly described. At the end of the paper I have given a table of all the languages and dialects of which (so far as I know) vocabularies have been published.\n\nI will commence with the Dravidian group. The Dravidian are the principal languages of the South of India, and are spoken by about 46 millions of people. Twelve languages are distinguished by Caldwell, viz. Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu, Canarese, Tulu, Kudagu, Toda, Kota, Gond, Khond, Oraon, Rajmahal. In the Dravidian group there is a rational and an irrational gender of the nouns, which is distinguished, in the plural of the nouns, and sometimes in the singular also, by affixes which appear to be fragmentary pronouns; by corresponding pronouns, and by the agreement of the verb with the noun, the gender of the verb being expressed by the pronominal suffixes. To give an instance of verbal gender, we have in Tamil from root *sey* 'to do,' *sey-an* 'he (rational) did'; *sey-il-at* 'she (rational) did'; *sey-adu* 'it (irrational) did'; *seyd-ar* 'they (the rationals) did'; *seyd-a* 'they (the irrationals) did'; the full pronouns being *an* 'he,' *at* 'she,' *adu* 'it,' *ar* 'they,' *aai* 'they.'\nThis distinction of gender, though it exists in most of the languages, is not always carried out to the extent that it is in Tamil. In Telugu, Gond, and Khond it is preserved in the plural, but in the singular the feminine rational is merged in the irrational gender. In Gond the gender is further marked by the noun in the genitive relation taking a different suffix, according to the number and gender of the noun on which it depends. In Oraon the feminine rational is entirely merged in the irrational gender, with the exception of the pronoun, which preserves the distinction between rationals and irrationals in the plural; as, *as* \u2018he,\u2019 referring to a god or a man; *\u00e1d* \u2018she,\u2019 or \u2018it,\u2019 referring to a woman or an irrational object; but *\u00e1r* \u2018they,\u2019 applies to both men and women; *abr\u00e1* \u2018they,\u2019 to irrationals only. The rational gender, besides human beings, includes the celestial and infernal deities; and it is further subdivided, in some of the languages, but in the singular only, into masculine and feminine. An instance of this subdivision in the Tamil verb was given above.\n\nThe grammatical relations in the Dravidian, as in most, but by no means in all, the non-Aryan languages, are generally expressed by suffixes. Many nouns have an oblique form, which is a remarkable characteristic of the Dravidian group; still, with the majority of nouns the postpositions are added directly to the nominative form. Other features of this group are the frequent use of formatives to specialize the meaning of the root; the absence of relative pronouns and the use instead of a relative participle, which is usually formed from the ordinary participle by the same suffix as that which Dr. Caldwell considers as the oldest sign of the genitive relation; the adjective preceding the substantive; of two substantives the determining preceding the determined; and the verb being the last member of the sentence. There is no true dual in the Dravidian languages, and the instance quoted by Caldwell of *n\u00e1m* in Oraon as meaning \u2018we two,\u2019 does not seem correct, as, according to Flex\u2019s grammar, it is the inclusive plural of the pronoun. In the Dravidian languages there are two forms\nof the plural of the pronoun of the first person, one including, the other excluding, the person addressed. As regards the verbs, there is a negative voice, but no passive voice, and there is a causal form. Grammatical categories and relations are sometimes expressed by a modification of the root, instead of by affixes; for instance, in Tamil, as pointed out by Caldwell, the final sonant is changed into a surd, and doubled, to convert an intransitive into a transitive verb, to form the preterite tense, to form derivative nouns from verbal themes, and to change a substantive into an adjective. Similar changes also take place in the other languages, though not quite to the same extent. Then there are changes of the initial consonant of the second of two nouns in juxtaposition, showing their relations, some of which resemble the mutation of consonants in Keltic grammar. Thus, in Canarese and Telugu, as in Welsh, an initial surd is changed into a sonant to show that the preceding noun is in the genitive relation; as in Telugu poetry, *puli doka* 'a tiger's tail,' which translated literally into Welsh would be *teigr-gyffon*; the radical forms being *toku* and *gyffon*, both signifying 'a tail.' Nor are root-vowels unchangeable. There are instances of the lengthening of the root-vowel to convert a verb into a noun, without any extraneous addition; of the shortening of the root-vowels of the pronouns of the first and second person in the oblique form; and there is the Tamil and Canarese shortening of the root-vowel in the preterite tense.\n\nNext to the Dravidian, and also south of the Vindhya, we have the Kolarian, a much smaller group, which probably does not include more than two millions of people, though ethnologically the group is very much larger. The principal members of this group appear to be the Santali, Mundari, Ha, Bhumij, Korwa, Kharria, Juang, Kurku, and probably Savara; some of these are not distinguished from each other by more than dialectal differences. The Juangs are isolated amidst an Oriya-speaking Aryan population; they disclaim all connexion with the Hos or other Kolarians; and yet they have preserved a remarkable number of common words. The Kurkus of the Central Provinces are separated by a distance\nof 300 or 400 miles from the main body of the Kolarians; and yet the Kurku is hardly more than a dialect of the Sant\u00e1li, showing, as will also be seen to be the case as regards several dialects in other groups, that there is, by no means of necessity, a rapid divergence of Turanian dialects, as has been generally supposed, in consequence of their isolation. The Kolarian group has both the cerebral and dental row, and also aspirated forms, which last, according to Caldwell, did not belong to early Dravidian. There is also a set of four sounds, which are perhaps peculiar to Sant\u00e1li, called by Skrefsrud semi-consonants, and which, when followed by a vowel, are changed respectively into \\( g \\), \\( j \\), \\( d \\) and \\( b \\). Gender of nouns is animate and inanimate, and is distinguished by difference of pronouns, by difference of suffix of a qualifying noun in the genitive relation, and by the gender being denoted by the verb. As instances of the genitive suffix, we have in Sant\u00e1li *in-ren hopon* 'my son,' but *in-ak orak* 'my house.' With this may be compared the signs of the genitive relation in Gond, as before alluded to, in the Modern Aryan languages of India, and in the Zulu of South Africa, in all of which a noun in the genitive relation has a different sign according to the gender of the noun on which it depends.\n\nThere is no distinction of sex in the pronouns, but of the animate and inanimate gender. Of the demonstrative pronouns in Sant\u00e1li, seven end in *i* for the animate, and seven in *a* for the inanimate gender. The dialects generally agree in using a short form of the third personal pronoun suffixed to denote the number, dual and plural, of the noun, and short forms of all the personal pronouns are added to the verb in certain positions to express both number and person, both as regards the subject and object, if of the animate gender; the inanimate gender being indicated by the omission of these suffixes. No other group of languages, apparently, has such a logical classification of its nouns, as that shown by the genders of both the South Indian groups. The genitive in the Kolarian group of the full personal pronouns is used for the possessive pronoun, which again takes all the postpositions, the genitive relation being thus indicated by the\ngenitive suffix twice repeated. The Kolarian languages generally express grammatical relations by suffixes, and add the postpositions directly to the root, without the intervention of an oblique form or genitive or other suffix. They agree with the Dravidian in having inclusive and exclusive forms for the plural of the first personal pronoun, in using a relative participle instead of a relative pronoun, in the position of the governing word, and in the possession of a true causal form of the verb. They have a dual which the Dravidians have not, but they have no negative voice. Counting is by twenties, instead of by tens, as in the Dravidian.\n\nThe Santali verb, according to Skrefsrud, has 23 tenses, and for every tense two forms of the participle and a gerund. The root is the future, and the various tense signs are suffixed thereto. The verb, by incorporating the short forms of the pronouns, expresses number and person of both an animate subject and object; thus Th\u0101k\u016br kakai-ko e-dandom-ko-a 'God sinners will punish.' The pronominal form denoting the subject may be either prefixed or made the last suffixed syllable; that denoting the object is inserted between the tense sign and the following n, which is a sort of verbal base, by means of which any part of speech may be used as a verb. In the above instance dandom is the root, which signifies 'will punish'; e is the pronominal denoting that the subject is animate and singular; ko that the object is animate and plural. For the dual the pronominal form is kin. If the subject and object in the above example had been inanimate, then both the e and ko would have been omitted. In Ho and Mundari, the pronominal form which points to the animate subject of the verb often comes both before and after the verb; thus, if a pronoun is the subject, it may be repeated three times: at the beginning of the sentence and before and after the verb. It is very good Mundari to say Ain ka-in jomtana-in\u2014'I not\u2014I am eating\u2014I,' that is, 'I am not eating.'\n\nA peculiar characteristic of the Kolarian group is that there are two forms for each tense. In Santali these two forms represent the different relations of the objects to the verb\u2014thus we have ti e-tiar-ad-in-a 'he stretched the hand\ntowards me'; *tanga e-rech-ked-in-a* 'he took the axe from me.' In these instances *ad* and *ked* are two different forms of the recent past tense, and the pronoun *in* 'me' of the remoter object is incorporated with the verb. In Ho and Mundari, however, the two sets of tense forms are explained in a different way, namely, as serving to distinguish a transitive from an intransitive verb, which is a distinction not made in Sant\u00e1li. Kolarian grammar apparently recognizes none of the root-changes of the Dravidian, but derivative forms are not always indicated by affixed particles only, but occasionally by infixes\u2014thus in Sant\u00e1li a noun may be formed by infixing *t*, *p*, or *n* with the same vowel as that of the root, for instance, *ra-pa-j* 'a collection of kings,' from *raj* 'a king'; *u-nu-m* 'immersion,' from *um* 'to bathe.' The reciprocal active voice is formed in a similar manner by the insertion of *p*; thus, *da-pa-l* 'strike together,' from *dal* 'to strike.' Besides its numerous tenses and participles, the Sant\u00e1li verb has four voices and several moods, and every voice has four forms. The other dialects have not apparently nearly so many verbal forms as the Sant\u00e1li, but most of them are alike in regard to the most characteristic features of their grammars. Kharria would seem, from Col. Dalton's specimen, to have lost its dual and plural forms; and perhaps the same is the case with Juang, which most resembles Kharria, and of which we have only a bare vocabulary of a few words.\n\nThe two groups of which I have spoken, the Dravidian and Kolarian, are the principal, and probably the only groups of languages south of or included within the limits of the Vindhya mountains. There are, however, many other aboriginal tribes, such as Bhils, Baig\u00e1s, Boyars, Kaurs, Rautias, and others, that have lost their language, but are generally ethnologically said to belong either to the Dravidian or Kolarian group.\n\nThe non-Aryan languages south of the Vindhya are separated by a very broad belt of Aryan tongues from the non-Aryan languages of our northern and eastern frontiers. The chief group we then come to is what has been called the Tibeto-Burman, from the two principal languages included in\nit\u2014an immense group\u2014the boundaries of which in the present state of our knowledge are very doubtful. It is impossible to give even an approximate number of the speakers included in this group, as many of the languages are either across the frontier or only project a short distance into our own territory. The languages included in this group have not, with perhaps one or two exceptions, both a cerebral and dental row, like the South-Indian languages; some of them have aspirated forms of the surds, but not of the sonants; others have aspirated forms of both. In the languages on the Burmese side there are also sounds like the Persian bhe and ghain, and Burmese has our English th. Both the Tibetan and Burmese have characters of considerable antiquity derived from the Sanskrit. The pronunciation of both these languages has greatly changed since these characters were first introduced. In Tibetan, as spoken in Lhasa and Tibet proper, the first member of a compound of consonants is generally not pronounced at all, while many compounds take altogether different sounds; sonants are for the most part pronounced as surds, final s is not pronounced, and some other final consonants are hardly heard. In Western Tibet, however, most of the consonants are pronounced as written. In Burmese, on the other hand, the surds are frequently pronounced as sonants; an r is pronounced as if it were y; some final consonants are mute, or they are often changed into different sounds; the vowel a is also pronounced as if it were e or i before certain final consonants. In Arakan, however, the original pronunciation is more frequently preserved.\n\nThe languages of this group, even those which most diverge from each other, have several words in common, and especially numerals and pronouns, and also some resemblances of grammar. In comparing the resembling words, the differences between them consist often less in any modification of the root-syllable, than in the various additions to the root; thus in Burmese we have na 'ear,' Tibetan rna-ba, Magar na-kep, Newar ni-pong, Dhimal na-hathong, Kiranti dialects na-pro, ni-rek, ni-phuk, Naga languages te-na-ro, te-na-rang, Manipuri na-kong, Kupui ka-na, Sak aka-na, Karen na-khu,\nand so on. It can hardly be doubted that such additions as these to monosyllabic roots are principally determinative syllables for the purpose of distinguishing between what would otherwise have been monosyllabic words having the same sound. These determinatives are generally affixed in the languages of Nepal and in the Dhimal language; prefixed in the Lepcha language, and in the languages of Asam, of Manipur, and of the Chittagong and Arakan hills. Words are also distinguished by difference of tone. The tones are generally of two kinds, described as the abrupt or short, and the pausing or heavy; and it has been remarked that those languages which are most given to adding other syllables to the root make the least use of the tones; and vice versa, where the tones most prevail, the least recourse is had to determinative syllables.\n\nIt is not, however, in words only, but to some extent in grammar also, so far as we have any materials to judge from, that even the most remotely apart languages of the group resemble each other. One of the most prominent points in which such resemblance is found is the use of the formatives \\(pa\\) and \\(ma\\), or modifications of them, as \\(po mo\\), etc., to distinguish sex, and also to form nouns of agency and gentile and other nouns, with distinction of sex; \\(na\\), \\(nu\\) or \\(ne\\), is, however, a common substitute for the feminine \\(ma\\). Thus we have in Tibetan \\(mi-bo\\) \u2018man,\u2019 \\(mi-mo\\) \u2018woman\u2019; \\(rta-pho\\) \u2018horse,\u2019 \\(rta-mo\\) \u2018mare\u2019; Bod-\\(pa\\) \u2018a man of Tibet,\u2019 Bod-\\(mo\\) \u2018a woman of Tibet\u2019; tshong-\\(pa\\) \u2018a trader (male),\u2019 tshong-\\(ma\\) \u2018a trader (female),\u2019 from tshong \u2018trade\u2019; smraba-\\(pa\\) \u2018speaker (male),\u2019 smraba-\\(mo\\) \u2018speaker (female)\u2019; bazang-\\(po\\) \u2018a good man,\u2019 bazang-\\(mo\\) \u2018a good woman,\u2019 from bazang \u2018good.\u2019 In Bahing ta-\\(wa\\) \u2018a son,\u2019 ta-\\(mi\\) \u2018a daughter\u2019; apo khlicha \u2018dog,\u2019 amo-khlicha \u2018bitch\u2019; ryamni-\\(po\\) \u2018adulterer,\u2019 ryamni-\\(mo\\) \u2018adultress\u2019; gna-\\(wa\\) \u2018old man,\u2019 gna-\\(mi\\) \u2018old woman.\u2019 In Burmese krak-\\(pha\\) \u2018cock,\u2019 krak-\\(ma\\) \u2018hen\u2019; nw\u0101-\\(la\\) \u2018bull,\u2019 nc\u0101-\\(ma\\) \u2018cow\u2019; mutsho-\\(pho\\) \u2018widower,\u2019 mutsho-\\(ma\\) \u2018widow\u2019; ashing \u2018master,\u2019 ashing-\\(ma\\) \u2018mistress\u2019; Mramma \u2018a Burmese man,\u2019 Mramma-\\(ma\\) \u2018a Burmese woman\u2019 In Lepcha, hik-\\(bu\\) \u2018cock,\u2019 hik-\\(mot\\) \u2018hen.\u2019 Again, in Garo \u00e1ch\u00e1k-bipha \u2018a dog,\u2019 \u00e1ch\u00e1k-bima \u2018a bitch.\nIn Khyeng khlaung-pa-hlo 'man'; khlaung-na-hlo 'woman.' In Mru kornga 'a horse,' kornga-ma 'a mare.' These formations are found more or less in almost all the languages, and even where sex is not distinguished, or we are not told of such distinction, in the short grammatical sketches we possess, pa appears to be often extensively used as a formative, as, for instance, in Lepcha mat-lo 'a doer,' from mat 'to do'; in Mikir kuchhang-po 'a beggar,' from kuchhang 'to beg'; in the Tando dialect of Kuki kelchingpa 'a herdsman.' In Karen some nouns are formed by prefixing pa, as pyha 'old,' papgha 'an elder,' gentile and such-like, by affixing pho, as kasupho 'mountaineers,' from kasu 'a mountain.' In Dhimal ka, in Magar chu, and in the Abor class dak or do, correspond to the adjectival pa or bo of Tibetan and other languages; thus Dhimal minka 'ripe,' Magar minchu, Abor mindo, Tibetan smingpo. In some languages a prefixed a is much used as a formative, as in Burmese atsa 'food,' from tsa 'to eat'; in Lepcha achor 'sour' from chor 'to be sour.' In Khyeng antik 'love,' from mlak 'to love'; in Manipuri asaba 'hot,' from saba 'heat.'\n\nThere is a good deal of resemblance between the postpositions in several languages, and in some of them the same form for the third personal pronoun is used to denote the genitive relation; thus in Bihing waina a ming 'the man his wife'; in Lushai tiu a wi 'the friend his dog'; in Karen phahknyau a htiwe 'the man his dog.' The postpositions in this group are of two kinds, simple and compound, the first member of the compound being generally the sign of the genitive or dative relation, as in Kachari ni 'of,' ni phra 'from.' The two South-Indian groups have only generally simple postpositions. In the present group, as the rule, adjectives follow their substantives, and then the postpositions are affixed to the adjectives, and not to the substantives; but, in nearly all the languages, the demonstrative pronouns precede the substantives. In the two South-Indian groups, and also in all the Aryan languages of India, both the adjective and the demonstrative invariably precede the substantive. In the\npresent group the verb comes at the end of the sentence. In general the relative clause is denoted by a relative participle, and the construction of the sentence is, according to our notions, of an inverted character. In these respects the Tibeto-Burman agrees with the two preceding groups. Some of the languages have a negative voice, but in most of them the same separate particle of negation, m\u00e1, is used. Interrogative sentences are also denoted by what is probably in its origin the same particle, but appears under a greater variety of forms, such as na, ma, am, mo, mon, man. But though the different members of the group resemble each other in some respects, in their grammar as well as in their vocabularies, yet the differences in other respects are very astonishing, and not easily to be accounted for on the supposition of the languages having all had a common origin. While, in many of the languages, the verb has no form to indicate any recognition of the number or person of the noun, in others, again, numerous complicated forms are employed to express the agreement of the verb with both subject and object, and these viewed in every variety of aspect, as singular, dual and plural, and in the case of dual and plural of the first person as including or excluding the persons addressed. Some of these points of difference will be referred to presently.\n\nAn interesting part of the inquiry into the non-Aryan languages always is the extent to which change of root is had recourse to for grammatical expression. Such a change will always be an exception to the general rule of fixed roots; but, in the present group, in regard to many of the languages of which we have only very meagre, if any, specimens of grammar, we must not conclude that they are wanting in exceptions to the general rule, because such exceptions are not mentioned. In many of the languages of the group of which we have anything like adequate details, we meet with such exceptions. Tibetan in particular abounds with them. The formation of the tenses in Tibetan depends, to a great extent, on certain prefixed letters; but, besides these, we have commonly, in transitive verbs, both vowel and consonant\nchanges of the root. For instance, in the past tense, we have generally, with the exception of the labial consonants, for the first consonant a surd; in the present, the corresponding aspirate or sonant; and, in the imperative, the corresponding aspirate. If, further, the past tense has the vowel \\(a\\), then we have frequently \\(e\\) for the vowel of the present, and \\(o\\) for that of the imperative; thus perf. \\(b\\)-kas, pres. \\(h\\)-gos, imperat. \\(khos\\) v.t. 'to split.' If, however, the root-vowel is \\(i\\) or \\(u\\), then it remains unchanged in all the tenses, as, for instance, past \\(b\\)-kum, pres. \\(h\\)-gam, imperat. \\(khum\\) v.t. 'to kill.' Again, intransitive verbs are usually distinguished from transitive by the aspiration or weakening of the surd of the perf. tense of the transitive verb, as the above-mentioned perf. \\(b\\)-kas v.t. 'to split'; but perf. \\(gos\\), pres. \\(h\\)-gos v.i. 'to split'; there being no change of the initial consonant or vowel change in the intransitive form. If, however, a verb commences with a labial consonant, we have an unspirated surd for the transitive, and an unaspirated sonant for the intransitive form, as perf. \\(phral\\) v.t. 'to separate'; perf. \\(bral\\), pres. \\(h\\)-bral v.i. 'to separate.' Burmese, on the other hand, not only in regard to labials, but throughout, forms transitives from intransitives by aspirating the initial consonant, as \\(kya\\) 'to fall down,' \\(khyo\\) 'to throw down,' and so on with many others. In Baling, again, the intransitive form has a sonant for the initial consonant, the transitive a surd, as \\(gikko\\) 'be born,' \\(kokko\\) 'beget'; \\(kokko\\) 'get up,' \\(pokko\\) 'raise up.'\n\nIn some languages a modification of the pronominal suffix of the verb takes place in order to change it from the subject into the object. Thus, in Baling, \\(khi-ka-mi\\) 'we quarrel with them,' \\(khi-ki-mi\\) 'they quarrel with us.' In Khyeng, to form the negative voice, besides the insertion of a letter, an initial surd is changed into a sonant, \\(sit-pha-u\\) 'may go,' \\(sit-pha-mlu\\) 'may not go.' But, as I have said, the few sketches of grammar we have are in general so short that we cannot expect to find in them any account of root-changes when they are merely exceptions to the ordinary rules.\n\nBut though the group itself is a very vague one, many of the languages may easily be subdivided into classes on\naccount of a clear resemblance in most respects; while other languages it will be convenient to consider under classes, on account of special points of resemblance. As Class I. I will distinguish the Kachari, Garo, Pani-Koch, Deori-Chutia and Tipura. It is more decidedly Indian\u2014being well within our frontier\u2014than most of the other classes, which are rather on and over the frontier. The languages composing this class are hardly separated from each other by more than dialectal differences. They are spread over a considerable tract of country from the Kachari in the north of Assam to the Tipura in the south part of the Chittagong district; and yet the Tipura in the south, though so far away from the Kachari, and completely isolated from it, bears the closest resemblance to it. The Kacharis form the principal part of the aboriginal population of Assam. The Garos are also an important tribe. The Pani-Koch are few in number; but if, as has been supposed, this was the original language of the great Koch tribe, then we have here the remnant of the language formerly spoken by a great part of the population of Northern Bengal. The Deori-Chutia is also spoken by a very small number; but it appears highly probable that this is the original language of the Chutias, a very important tribe in Assam. This class is of the simple type as regards the verb, which has no number or person; thus, in Kachari, \u00e1ng thango 'I go,' nang thango 'thou goest,' bi thango 'he goes,' jang thango 'we go,' etc. The principal postpositions are identical in all the languages. There is a peculiarity about the comparison of adjectives which is hardly found in the other languages, either Aryan or non-Aryan, of India, namely, that a particle of comparison follows the adjective, as in Kachari bi-ni gedet chin 'greater than him,' where the particle chin comes after the adjective gedet 'great.' What are called generic particles are extensively used in these languages, that is to say, nothing is numbered without some particle being added to classify the thing numbered, and such classes are very numerous, as in Kachari m\u00e1ns\u00e9 s\u00e1 b\u00e1 'man genus five,' phitai thai b\u00e1 'fruit genus five.' The first personal pronoun has a different form for the plural, as in Kachari \u00e1ng 'I,' jang\nwe'; in Garo ang\u00e1 'I,' ching\u00e1 'we.' The plural of the other pronouns is formed by plural affixes.\n\nAs Class II. I take the Tibetan, including such dialects as Sarpa, Lhopa and Changlo. Some account of the Tibetan verb has already been given. In Tibetan, not only the adjective, but the demonstrative pronoun also, follows the substantive; a distinction may be made between 'he' and 'she,' namely, kha-pa 'he,' kho-ma 'she,' and, with a transitive verb, the agent is required to be in the instrumental case, so to call it.\n\nClass III., Gurung, Murmi, Thakya, Newar, Pahri, Magar, in fact, all those languages of Nepal, which, like the Tibetan, are said to be of the simple type, the verb having no suffixes of number or person. Murmi, however, is but a dialect of Gurung, and Newar and Pahri are also very closely related to each other. The languages of Nepal generally have all a considerable proportion of Tibetan words, but they differ from the Tibetan, and agree with the Arakan hill languages, and, in fact, with most of the other languages of the group, in regard to other words, showing a special connexion with those distant languages, independently of the Tibetan. To give an instance or two, \u00fa, or with prefixes ph\u00fa, moh, etc., is the numeral 'four' in most of the other languages, but it is b-zhe in Tibetan; or, again, lung 'a stone' in the other languages, but z-do in Tibetan. In Magar, the adjective precedes the substantive, which is an exception to the general rule, but this perhaps is owing to the influence of the Hindi, this language being full of Hindi words. Class IV. the Lepcha only. This agrees with the preceding class in having the simple structure of the verb, and differs in its use of determinative prefixes instead of affixes. In Lepcha, also, not only the adjective, but the demonstrative pronoun, as in Tibetan, follows the substantive. It has also for its nouns a dual affix nyum, and two plural affixes, sang used chiefly for human beings, pang for irrational objects only. It has a definite article rr which comes after the noun, and takes m as the sign of the accusative relation; thus pano rr 'the king,' acc. pano rem. The same suffix marks the accusative relation of the personal pronouns. There is some agreement as regards the\nClass V. is still in use, with the new class. As Class V., but to which no language, like, and other three languages will have nothing in common. They are of the simple type. A characteristic of this class is that the accusative and genitive forms of nouns are expressed by suffixing a single vowel. Thus, *no* 'thou,' nom. *nom* 'of the,' gen. *ong,* acc. *ong.* The dual of the plural has the same base as the singular; and a letter *v* is added plural sign. The plural of *no* is *no-bu.*\n\nThese languages have often a prefixed vowel, which is not found in the corresponding words of the other languages; e.g., Burmese *khae* 'dog,' Burmese *khae,* but Dophla *khae* 'dog,' *khae* 'dog,' and in many other words. Class VI., as Aka, is an independent member of the group. The vocabulary of this language, given by the Rev. N. Brown, as written by missionary in 1837, makes the Aka have 47 or more distinct words; but this is not the case; he has omitted several Aka for Dophla. The Aka proper, as given in other recent lists of words, has but the faintest, if any, resemblance to that class, notwithstanding that the Aka are said to be neighbours of the Dophlas. The connection of Aka is richer with the languages south of the Himalayas, though it cannot be classed with any of them.\n\nClass VII., the usual suffix denoting the female sex, as *sami* 'daughter'; *sami* 'daughter'; *sami* 'daughter.' Class VII., the Mishmi.\n\nThere are also principal tribes, the Chalikota, the Taying, etc., which are not languages, though clearly enough belonging to some class far more further apart than mere languages. These languages are especially remarkable for the peculiar character of the beginning of words, many of them being of such compounds that are no longer pronounceable as separate words. Examples such as in Taying *milo* 'copper,' *khro* 'cry,' or *glok* 'back,' *bli* 'raise,' however, appear to be Tibetan.\n\nThe languages of these peoples have all the simple structure of nouns, and no signs added for number or person.\nClass VIII. I will call the Dhimal alone. Here we meet with apparently the first step towards the complex structure. We have the pronoun coming after the verb; lekhi ka 'come I'; lekhi na 'comest thou'; lekhi ra 'comes he,' lekhi kyel 'come we,' etc. Here kha is the sign of the present tense.\n\nThe first and second personal pronouns, generally, but not always, come before as well as after the verb, as ku lekhi ka, na lekhi na, etc. Here, therefore, the last is a sort of person ending of the verb. The pronoun of the third person may come either before or after, but not both. Dhimal is further characterized by a sort of inflexion in the declension of the pronouns; thus ku 'I' has for dat. and acc. keing, gen. kiing, nom. plur. kyel. Another characteristic of Dhimal is that the demonstrative pronouns have different forms according as they refer to an animate or inanimate object; adong 'this' and adong 'that,' referring to animate, ili and uti to inanimate objects.\n\nClass IX., Kanawari and Bunun. Here we have the person endings with little resemblance to any existing form of the pronoun; thus, in the Milchhan dialect of Kanawari, the present tense of bi 'go' is sing. 1. bitu-k, 2. bitu-n, 3. bitu-o; plur. 1. bit-e, 2. bit-en, 3. bit-e, pronominal endings which bear little resemblance to the pronouns goa 'I,' kis 'thou,' nos 'he,' kishang 'we,' kinat 'ye,' negowla 'they.' Bunun is spoken in part of Lahaul, and is the same language as the Tibarskad, one of the Kanawari dialects. The same language thus exists in two provinces separated from each other by a considerable extent of country, in part of which pure Tibetan, and in the other part Hindi, is spoken. This is another of several instances we have in India of languages which do not alter, or alter very slightly, though spoken in different and distant parts of the country. This class has a very large percentage of Tibetan words, and yet, as we have seen, an entirely different structure of the verb. The original pronunciation of many Tibetan words, which has been lost in Tibet proper, is often preserved more completely in Kanawari; thus Milchhan shura, Tibetan skarma pronounced karma, 'a star.' Milchhan kra, Tibetan skra pronounced sha, 'hair.' Milchhan pya, Tibetan bya pronounced cha, 'a bird.' Or in\nTibarek\u0101d *brao*, Tibetan *brabo* pronounced *tavo*, 'buckwheat.'\nTibarek\u0101d *brul*, Tibetan *brul* pronounced *dul*, 'a snake.'\n\nWe now come to several languages which I will place together as Class X., not because it is warranted by any close resemblance of their vocabularies, but because they are all said to have a similarly complex structure of the verb. These are Kiranti, Limbu, Sunwar, Br\u00e1mu, Chepang, Vayu, Kusunda. Limbu, however, is but a dialect of Kiranti, and Vayu and Chepang have several words in common. We have outline grammars of only two of the languages. To give some idea of the complex structure of a verb of this class, expressing agreement with both subject and object, I take the following specimen of the conjugation of part of the present tense of a verb in the Baling dialect of the Kiranti:\n\nAfter No. I. in the subjoined table there should come nine more forms for the second personal pronoun as subject, and nine others for the pronoun of the third person as subject. Then reversing this arrangement, we have a corresponding set of forms, the first portion of which is shown in No. II. of the table, for the pronoun of the third person as subject, and all the pronouns as objects. Then, again, there are eighteen forms for the relation of the first and second personal pronouns as subjects and objects, making in all what ought to be eighty-four forms for the number and person endings of each tense,\nbut they are not all complete, and they occasionally run into each other, as when the same pronoun is both subject and object. It will be observed from the examples above given that the pronominal of the third person, when expressed, is always the last member of the compound, whether it represents the subject or object of the verb, and that it is unchanged in form; and whether it is to be regarded as expressing the subject or object, depends upon the form of the preceding suffix. These pronominal suffixes are in most cases evidently abridgments of the full forms of the pronouns.\n\nThere are eleven conjugations, but all the changes are limited to the singular of the indicative. The participles incorporate the pronominals, just like the other parts of the verb, and are for the most part constituted by adding a formative to the tense forms; thus the present verbal participle is *taganu* 'I finding him,' the relative *taganu* 'the one that I find.' The dual and plural suffixes of the first and second pronouns are different from those of the third pronoun and of the noun; thus, *ga* 'thou,' *gasi* 'you two,' *ganu* 'you'; *waisa* 'man,' *waisadai* 'two men,' *waisada* 'men.' In the Vayu language the structure of the verb differs from that of the Bahing in this respect, that it can express the dual and plural of either the subject or the object, but not of both. If it is the case that all the languages referred to in this group have a common origin, including both those which have the elaborate conjugational arrangement of the class just mentioned, and those which have the simple structure, the mere juxtaposition of pronoun or noun and verb, we can hardly suppose that the complex system was once common to all, and that while some languages have retained it, others have so completely thrown it off as to leave not a trace behind. It seems more probable that the wild tribes who speak the languages of Class X. should have developed this system in the seclusion of the valleys or hills to which they betook themselves when they separated from the common stock. There are several other non-Aryan tribes in Nepal who speak, for the most part, dialects of Hindi which I shall not mention, with one exception, the Kuswar, which has preserved\ntraces of a grammar unlike that of any of the languages before mentioned in that it suffixes a possessive pronominal to the noun. In this respect, therefore, the Kuswar resembles the Altaic languages; for instance, *baba-im* 'my father,' *baba-tr* 'thy father,' *baba-ik* 'his father.' The same pronominal forms are also incorporated with the verb to express both subject and object, as *thatha-im-ik-an* 'I strike him or it.' The detached forms of the pronouns, on the other hand, are almost pure Hindi. This language, however, can hardly be classed as non-Aryan without further particulars.\n\nThe languages so far mentioned, with the exception of Class I., have been all along our northern frontier. South of the valley of Asam we meet with a number of tribes called Naga; but as this is a foreign name, it does not necessarily mean that they are allied either in race or languages; indeed, it is impossible to include them all in the same class. The Ang\u00e1-mi, for instance, is very far removed from most of the other Naga languages. I propose to divide them into three classes. Class XI., the Namsang, etc. The Namsang is remarkable for having person endings of the verb, but no number endings, person endings being the same both for the sing. and the plural. The sign for the past tense *t* is affixed for the future *i* prefixed; for instance, for the past tense of the verb *thien* 'to put,' 1. *thien-t-ak* 'I or we did put,' 2. *thien-t-o*, 3. *thien-t-\u00e1*; for the future, 1. *i-thien-ang*, 2. *i-thien-o*, 3. *i-thien-\u00e1*. The Namsang, again, has possessive pronouns which differ both from the full personal pronouns and the verbal suffixes. In this class may also be included the Banpar\u00e1 and the Tablung; at least, they all three resemble each other in their vocabularies more than they do any of the other Nagas, but we have no grammars by which to judge them any further. All three, however, distinguish the sex of animals by modifications of the same affixes, the names for male and female being *pong* and *nyong*, *pang* and *hunu*, *apang* and *anyuk*, for the three languages respectively. Again, *sikau* and *sikah* are the words for 'woman' in Banpar\u00e1 and Tablung, and are further applied to distinguish sex, as Banpar\u00e1 *sikau hosa* 'daughter,' Tablung *sikah nahah* 'daughter.' Again, in Namsang and Banpar\u00e1,\npa and ma are frequently affixed to nouns as determinatives. All three languages have modified forms, namely ma, m, and man respectively, of the same plural termination for the pronouns.\n\nClass XII., the Khari, Nougong, Tengsa, and Lhota Nagas. Nougong and Tengsa are related as dialects, Khari further away, and Lhota still further. The verb in these languages is apparently of the simple type. The Nagas of this and the preceding class are all to the east of the Doyang River. Class XIII., the Angami, etc. There is a wide difference between the Angami and the before-mentioned Nagas. Very few words correspond. To the same class also may perhaps be referred the Arung and the Rengma. These languages are more like the Angami than they are to the other Nagas, though the likeness is not strong, nor are they very like each other. The Angami and the Arung have the simple structure of the verb. Of the Rengma verb I have not found any specimen. The Kuteha Naga is nearly the same as the Arung. The Nagas of this class are west of the Doyang. Most of the Naga languages have as many names given them as there are lists of words; thus the Banpur\u00e1 is called also Seebesangor, Abhay Puryn, and Joboka, in different lists. The Namsang is called also Jaipuria and Luckimpore, and so on with others. To this same class must also be referred at least two of what are called the hill tribes of Manipur, namely, Liyang and Mar\u00e1m, which are more nearly allied to the Arung Naga than to the Manipuri language. Class XIV., the Mikir, is a neighbour of the Nagas, and has many words in common with some of them, especially with the Namsang, and, like the Namsang, it has no sign for the genitive relation, which is signified solely by position, the noun in that relation coming first. The Mikir verb, however, differs entirely from the Namsang; it has no person ending, but the simple structure, as ne cho 'I eat,' ali cho 'we eat.'\n\nTo the east of the Nagas we have Class XV., the Singpho, who are comparatively recent settlers in Assam. Other settlements of them are on the hills to the east of Bhamo, and in\nthe western part of Yunan, where they are called Kakhyens, the Kakhyen and Singpho languages being nearly the same thing. The Singpho verb is of the simple type. The negative verb is formed by prefixing \\( n \\) to the initial consonant; \\( n \\) is also prefixed to some words as a determinative; for instance, \\( nlung \\) \u2018a stone,\u2019 \\( lung \\) and \\( long \\) in other languages; \\( ntsin \\) \u2018water,\u2019 Manipuri \\( ishing \\). Singpho has many words in common with both Burmese and Manipuri.\n\nThe principal language of our eastern frontier is Class XVI., Burmese, as Tibetan is of our northern. It can hardly be doubted that they both belong to the same group. Many of the combinations of initial consonants are the same in both languages; but the pronunciation has not altered so much in Burmese as in Tibetan. An initial \\( s \\) in Tibetan followed by another consonant often corresponds to the aspirated form of the consonant in Burmese, as Tibetan \\( stong \\) \u2018a thousand,\u2019 Burmese \\( htaung \\); Tibetan \\( sna \\) \u2018nose,\u2019 Burmese \\( hna \\). Tones are much used in Burmese, whereas they are but little heard in Tibetan, and only, I believe, in part of Tibet; but then Burmese has not the determinative syllables or letters of the Tibetan, for which the tones are the substitutes. The Burmese verb has no person endings, but it has a plural suffix \\( kra \\), thus \\( gna thura-thi \\) \u2018I go,\u2019 \\( gnado thua-kra-thi \\) \u2018we go.\u2019 With the numerals in Burmese a great many generic particles are used.\n\nThe principal languages of Class XVII. are the Manipuri, Kuki, and Khyeng. Manipuri has many words in common, both with Burmese and Singpho, and with some of the Nagas; but, both in grammar and vocabulary, it seems to belong more decidedly to the present class. No language of this class has the sound of the Burmese \\( th \\). Manipuri with some words, and Kuki always, show the genitive relation by the use of the abridged form of the pronoun. In Manipuri this makes a sort of double genitive, as a genitive suffix is also used. Thus Manipuri \\( ai-gi i-p\u00e1 \\) \u2018of me my father,\u2019 \\( mi-gi ma-kok \\) \u2018of the man his head\u2019; Lushai Kuki \\( koyma ka p\u00e1 \\) \u2018I my father,\u2019 \\( mi a lu \\) \u2018the man his head.\u2019 In Kuki and Khyeng the verb has the signs of number and person\nprefixed; thus, in Lushai, perfect of pe 'give,' sing. 1. ka-p\u00e9-ta 'I gave,' 2. i-p\u00e9-ta, 3. a-p\u00e9-ta; plural 1. ka-n-p\u00e9-ta, 2. m-p\u00e9-ta, 3. nu-p\u00e9-ta; the full forms of the pronouns being koyma 'I,' nungma 'thou,' ana 'he,' kopmani 'we,' etc. In Thado Kuki there is no difference between the singular and plural forms; these are: 1. ka-p\u00e9-ta 'I (or we) gave,' 2. na-p\u00e9-ta, 3. a-p\u00e9-ta. In Khyeng, again, sing. 1. ku-p\u00e9k-niu 'I gave,' 2. na-p\u00e9k-niu, 3. na-p\u00e9k-niu; plural 1. nu-p\u00e9k-niu, etc., the full forms of the pronouns being kie 'I,' nawn 'thou,' ayat 'he,' kie-me 'we,' etc. The Khyeng has a different suffix for the dual and plural of the noun and pronoun, but the tense forms are the same for the dual as for the plural. All three languages have a negative voice formed by inserting da or d in Manipuri, hi in Kuki, and n, m, or mb in Khyeng. They all use a prefixed a extensively as a formative of adjectives or substantives. Manipuri is said to change the adjectival formative affix ha into hi for the feminine, but I do not find this to be the case in all the examples, nor is it clear that it ever takes place except for the purpose of harmonizing the adjectival termination with the ending of a noun in i. Several other languages in the neighbourhood of Manipur may also be included in this class, of which we have no grammars, from the close connexion of their vocabularies with Manipuri, such as Maring, Kupui, Tangkbul, Lahupa, Khungui, Phadang, Champhung, Kupome, and some others.\n\nAs Class XVIII. I take the Kumi, Mru, Banjogi, Shendu, Sak, and Kyan languages of the Arakan hills. They are, no doubt, very like the languages of the preceding class and the Burmese; but, on the whole, they are more like each other. They agree to a considerable extent in the non-Burmese words of their vocabularies, and in regard to words which they have in common with the Burmese; they differ principally in this respect from the Burmese, that they prefix a determinative syllable to the root, whereas the Burmese has generally the bare root only; as Burmese le 'air,' Kumi a-l, Mru ru-li, Banjogi k-li, Shendu t-li, etc. Kumi and Mru are the only languages of which we have any\nspecimens which show the conjugation of the verb, and they have the simple type of verb, and differ, therefore, in this respect from the Kuki and Khyeng. Kumi has the typical sex-affix, as in *tchi-po* 'a son,' distinguished from *tchi-nu* 'a daughter.' In Mru we have *ungcha* 'a son,' and *ungcha-ma* 'a daughter.'\n\nThe last class to be mentioned is the Karen, Class XIX. There are eight dialects, namely, Sgau, Bghai, Red Karen, Pwo, Taru, Mopgha, Kay or Gaikho, and Toungthu. The Karen differs in some important respects from all the other classes; in fact, it is one of the most doubtful members of the group. The structure of the sentence is different, the accusative comes after the verb instead of preceding it, as in the other classes. The most remarkable distinctions of the Karen, however, are its numerous tones, five in number, which are constantly employed, and turn speaking into chanting. Yet Karen is certainly Tibeto-Burman in its vocabulary, and also in the position it assigns to the qualifying noun before the qualified. Besides its use of tones, Karen distinguishes the meaning of words by adding significant determinative words instead of unmeaning determinative syllables; thus in the Sgau dialect, it says *htwie hto* 'dog-hog' for 'dog,' *hto hoan* 'hog-fowl' for 'hog.' The verb is of the simple type, but while the pronoun of the first and second persons precedes the verb, that of the third person follows; thus *ya au* 'I eat,' *na au* 'thou eatest,' *au we* 'eats he,' *p\u00e1 au* 'we eat,' *thu au,* 'ye eat,' *au we* 'eat they.' In the passive voice, besides a special suffix *tha*, the first and second pronouns are repeated after the verb, as *ya au ya tha* 'I am eaten'; *ma* prefixed makes an intransitive verb transitive. In the perfect tense *li* is affixed, for the future *ka* prefixed. Other relations of the verb are expressed by a great number of prefixed and affixed particles, and these describe with excessive minuteness all the circumstances of the action: *a*, a form of the third personal pronoun, as before stated, expresses the genitive relation: *au* 'with' or 'from,' and *leu* 'with' or 'by,' are prepositions. Other relations are expressed by *leu* preceding and another\nON THE NON-ARYAN LANGUAGES OF INDIA.\n\nparticle following; as leu\u2014aphu 'in,' leu\u2014apho la 'below.' Generic particles are very numerous.\n\nThere are some other languages which do not properly come within the subject of this paper, being neither Indian nor border-languages, but which certainly belong to the present group. This is the case as regards five of the trans-Himalayan languages, specimens of which were collected by Hodgson, namely Takpa, Gyarung, Manyak, Horpa, and Thochu, which have many words in common with the Tibetan. Another distant language is the Lisaw, spoken in parts of Yunnan, which appears to be most like the Burmese; most of the numerals are almost identical with the Burmese.\n\nThe next group to be mentioned is the Khasi, which belongs to the hills between the valley of Assam and Sylhet. The Khasia, according to the last census, number only 92,070. Five dialects are given in Sir George Campbell's specimens, one of them being distinguished as the 'Khasi' proper. The dialects of the Jynteah hills are almost unintelligible to the residents of the Khasi; still all the members of the group are so much alike in construction that they must be spoken of as dialects rather than as languages with reference to each other. Tones similar to those of the last group play a very important part in distinguishing between words. The group has several important characteristics, which serve to distinguish it from all the languages hitherto mentioned. All grammatical relations are denoted by prefixes, which are often significant, and can be used as separate words. Nong 'an inhabitant,' 'a fellow,' forms most nouns of agency; jing 'a thing,' abstract nouns; as, u-nongbam 'an eater,' ka-jingbam 'food'; from bim 'to eat.' Again la, an adverb signifying 'since,' is the prefix for the past tense. The genitive relation of a noun is frequently signified by position only, when the noun in that relation comes after the noun on which it depends; as: ka-sem massi, the order being 'house cow,' but the meaning 'cow house'; but the sign of the genitive relation is frequently omitted where it cannot be omitted in English and other Aryan languages: as ka-rong u-blang 'horn goat,' but meaning 'goat's horn.' In this respect the Khasi group\ndiffers not only from the non-Aryan languages before mentioned, but also from the Aryan and from the Chinese. Not only animate but inanimate and abstract nouns are distinguished as masculine or feminine, and both the adjective expresses agreement with its substantive and the verb with its subject in this respect. In the plural, gender is not distinguished. The personal pronouns in the Khasi dialect are: nga 'I,' ngi 'we'; me (m.), pha (f.) 'thou,' phi 'you'; u (m.) 'he,' ka (f.) 'she,' ki 'they.' The third personal pronoun plays an important part in denoting when prefixed both the gender of the substantive and the agreement of the adjective and verb therewith. It will be remembered that, in the two Southern Indian groups, the gender of the verb was signified by suffixed pronominals.\n\nIn animate objects the distinction of sex is made by the prefixed pronoun, as u-briw 'a man,' ka-briw 'a woman'; u-h\u00e1n 'a drake,' ka-h\u00e1n 'a duck.' Of inanimate objects the great majority no doubt are feminine; still several of the great objects of nature are masculine, as the names for 'tree,' 'mountain,' 'rock,' 'star,' and also u-byuai 'the moon' is masculine, while ka-sngi 'the sun' is feminine; also many words for smaller objects, such as for rice, sulphur, chain, bread, fruit, etc., are masculine. Abstract nouns, however, are all feminine. The following is an example of the way in which the agreement of the verb and the adjective with the substantive is expressed: u-kynna u-babha u-la-wan 'the good boy came.' La is the prefix denoting the past tense, and babha is the adjective 'good.' Most adjectives are formed from some other part of speech by the prefix ba, as in the above instance; babha 'good,' from the adverb bha 'well'; or again, as bahok 'just,' from hok 'justice.' The plural prefix ki is common to both genders, as ki-sim ki-her 'birds fly.' The usual order of words in a sentence is subject, verb, object; as u-briw u-punih ia ka-ing 'the man shows the house,' where ia is the preposition denoting the accusative relation. Another characteristic of the Khasi is that vowels are sometimes dropped to avoid a hiatus; as nga'n shim 'I will take,' for nga yn shim; nga'm shim 'I do\nnot take,' for *nga ym shim*. The Khasi again differs from the groups before mentioned, in having a relative pronoun which expresses the relative clause as completely as any Aryan language. This relative is *ba*, which takes the usual gender prefixes; thus: *ka-kynthei ka-bo shong ha ka-la ka-ing* 'the woman who lives in that house,' where *ka-bo* is the relative agreeing in number and gender with *ka-kynthei* 'the woman,' and the order of the words is exactly as in the English. Thus the construction of the sentence is direct, quite different from the inverted order, as it seems to us, found in all the preceding groups. No other language, I believe, outside the Aryan and Semitic families, personifies every object as masculine or feminine. The Hottentot, indeed, is said to be something like the Khasi in this respect, but it does not make the same exhaustive division of all objects into masculine and feminine. There are other genders or classes besides the masculine and feminine.\n\nAnother group is the Tai, which includes the Ahom, Khamti, Shan, Lao, Siamese, and Tai Mow. Most of these languages are not separated by more than dialectal differences, though the group extends from the Gulf of Siam to Western Assam, over more than fifteen degrees of latitude. The Tai Mow or Chinese Shan language, however, differs a good deal from the others. This group agrees with the Khasi in regard to the position of the noun in the genitive relation; but it has no such resemblances of vocables or otherwise as will justify our placing it in the same group with the Khasi; nor has the Tai any grammatical gender like the Khasi. In Tai, also, the demonstrative pronoun follows, whereas in Khasi it precedes the noun. All the members of the Tai group are literary dialects, and their alphabets are derived from the Burmese, with the exception of the Siamese alphabet, which is more remotely connected, though doubtless, also, of Indian origin. The pronunciation, in some at least of the dialects, seems to have changed a good deal since the introduction of writing; the sound of a preceding vowel in Shan is often changed with reference to the final consonant, while in Siamese several final consonants\nare pronounced in the same manner. There are some letter-\nchanges between the different dialects; for instance, a Khamti\nand Shan m frequently corresponds to a b in the other dialects,\na Khamti and Shan h to r in the others, and a Khamti n to a\nShan l and to d in the others. Again, in some dialects we\nfind the same word with the aspirated, in others with the\nunaspirated form of the consonant. There are five tones\nwhich play an important part in all the dialects, but, except in\nthe Siamese, they are not expressed in writing. The relations\nof nouns are expressed by prepositions, with the exception of\nthe genitive relation, for which, however, there is a preposi-\ntion in Siamese; but in the other dialects it is expressed solely\nby the position of the noun in that relation after the noun on\nwhich it depends. The nominative and accusative also are\nordinarily distinguished by collocation only, the one before,\nthe other after the verb. There are several compounds con-\nsisting of two nouns, the latter of course being the qualifying\nnoun, which, when literally translated into English, have a\nsort of poetry about them; as in Siamese luk-mai \u2018son of the\ntree\u2019 = fruit; me-n\u00e1m \u2018mother of waters\u2019 = river; n\u00e1m-n\u00e1m\n\u2018water of udders\u2019 = milk. Generic particles are extensively\nused in all the dialects; adjectives follow their substantives,\nand there are relative pronouns. The structure of the verb\nis of the simple type; the signs of some tenses are prefixed,\nof others affixed; and the dialects do not all agree in this\nrespect.\n\nI now come to the last group, the Mon, etc., of which,\nhowever, Mon is the only representative among the Indian\nlanguages. Mon is also called Taleing and Peguan. Pegu\nwas the original habitation of the Mons, but they were driven\nout of a great part of it by the Burmese about 100 years\nago, and many of them have settled in Siam. Some affinity\nhas been supposed to exist between the Mon and the Kolarian\ngroup, on account of the evident likeness between the first\nnumerals and some few other words; but it is not upon such\nslight evidence that the groups hitherto mentioned have been\nformed. These have been established, not only upon the\nresemblances of a much greater number of words, but of\ngrammar also, while nothing can well be more different than Mon and Kolarian grammar. It is apparently with Kambojan and Anamese that the Mon has the nearest affinities, and considering the distance at which Mon is separated from these two languages by the intervening Tai, the resemblance between them is very remarkable, and with the Kambojan the resemblance is not confined to root-words only, but extends also to the prefixes.\n\nAnother language, apparently, on the whole, from its vocabularies, though we have no grammar, belonging to this group, is the Paloung. The pronunciation of words ending with h in Mon is said to be very fatiguing, at least to foreigners, and the Kambojan also has many words with final h. Not only is there a considerable resemblance of vocabularies, but the grammatical structure of Mon, Kambojan and Anamese is much the same. The most common relations of nouns are expressed by position only, the nominative before, the accusative after the verb, the genitive by following the noun on which it depends. Other relations are expressed by prepositions. Again, sex is distinguished by affixes, which are different for human beings and for animals. Kon in all three languages means a child or the young of any animal; thus Mon kon treu 'son,' kon prau 'daughter'; Kambojan kon prau 'son,' kon srey 'daughter'; Anamese kon treu 'son,' kon gai 'daughter.' In Mon, again, chek kmok 'horse,' chek bnh 'mare'; Kambojan seh chhmul 'horse,' seh uhi 'mare.' Adjectives follow their substantives, and they are compared by a particle of comparison placed after the adjective. The verb in all three languages has the simple structure. Some particles may occasionally be used to characterize the tenses; but more frequently there is nothing but the connexion to show the tense or mood.\" There is this remarkable difference, however, between the Mon and Kambojan on the one hand, and the Anamese on the other hand, that whereas the two former apparently have but little if any recourse to tones, the Anamese has six tones, which are very extensively used. The two former, however, make up for the want or little use of tones in the same way as that spoken\nof with regard to several members of the Tibeto-Burman group, namely, by the use of a greater number of determinative prefixes, and especially is this the case with regard to the Mon; for instance, Mon and Kambojan *th-ngay* 'the sun or the day,' compared with Anamese *ngay*; Mon *k-dau* 'the head,' Anamese *dau*; Mon *k-to* 'the ear,' Anamese *tai*. In Kambojan, also, there are very great varieties of vowel-sounds, which serve to distinguish between many monosyllabic words, the meanings of which might otherwise have been confounded. Again, there are few derivative words in Anamese; but in Mon, at least, they are often formed by prefixes. In Mon, also, substantives are sometimes formed from verbal roots by some infix or modification of the root; as *tmlu* 'darkness,' from *klu* 'to be dark'; *kmiaut* 'a thief,' from *klaut* 'to steal.' As regards the characters in which these languages are written, those of the Mon are nearly the same as the Burmese. Anamese employs the Chinese characters, adapted to a phonetic syllabary; and the Kambojan has also a syllabary, but with characters of its own, which primarily represent consonants followed by *a* and consonants followed by *o*; signs being added to denote the numerous modifications of these two vowel-sounds.\n\n**Table of the Non-Aryan Languages of India.**\n\n*Note.*\u2014Brackets refer to dialects that are very closely related; * refers to languages not distinguished on the map; \u2020 to languages beyond the circle of the Indian languages.\n\n**Dravidian.**\n\n- Tamil\n- Malayalam\n- Telugu\n- Canarese\n- Badaga\n- Tulu\n- Kudagu or Coorg\n- Tuda\n- Kota\n- Gond dialects\n\n**Mahadeo**\n- Raj\n- Maria\n- Khond or Ku\n- Orson or Dhangar\n- Rajmahal or Maler\n- Miscellaneous Dialects.\n  - Naikude\n  - Kolami\n  - Krikidi\n  - Yerukala\n  - Gadaba\n\n1 Also ancient Tamil, a very important study; and two dialects, Irula and Kuruba.\n2 Other dialects in Hunter's Dictionary, Gayeti, Rutluk, Madi.

II.\u2014A Dialogue on the Vedantic Conception of Brahma.\n\nBy Pramad\u00e1 D\u00e1sa Mittra, late Officiating Professor of Anglo-Sanskrit, Government College, Benares.\n\nEuropean Scholar.\u2014Is the God of the Ved\u00e1ntin a conscious or an unconscious being?\n\nPandit.\u2014Your question rendered into Sanskrit \u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0928\u093e\u092e\u094d \u0935\u093e \u091a\u0947\u0924\u0928\u093e\u092e\u094d \u0935\u093e would indeed startle a Ved\u00e1ntin, who would consider it an insult offered to his philosophy of pure spiritualism.\n\nS. But, is not the charge of unconsciousness or virtual nihilism brought against the Vedantic notion of the Deity not only by modern European scholars, but by old Indian thinkers of an antagonistic school? These have called the Ved\u00e1ntins \u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0935\u0948\u0926\u093f\u0915\u0903 'disguised nihilists.'\n\nP. Yes, the charge has arisen from a serious error in their own way of thinking, thus leading to a misunderstanding of the very scope of the Ved\u00e1nta. But there is a mixture of truth in it, and so the mistake has been shared by ancient as well as modern thinkers.\n\nS. A profound living philosopher of our country, Herbert Spencer, has remarked that there is often a bone of truth in the grossest falsehood. Will you decompose this charge into its truth and falsehood?\n\nP. In the first place we must consider well the meaning we attach to consciousness in general. Our sensations and the consequent mental impressions taking the form of memory and imagination, along with a comparison\\(^1\\) of their similitude and dissimilitude, are the elements that enter into the composition of what we call our consciousness (buddhi).\n\n\\(^1\\) The function of what is called by Hamilton the Elaborative Faculty or Understanding Proper.\nWestern philosophers all admit that our consciousness is not possible except in relation to the so-called external objects. It is a continual flux, having for its necessary condition the objective world, that is to say, we cannot be conscious, without being cognizant of some external object or internal impression originally induced thereby.\n\nS. Indeed, according to the Berkelian theory followed by some of the profoundest modern philosophers, our consciousness is composed of what are called external objects, but what in fact are sensations conveyed through our sensitive organism and the consequent purely mental impressions.\n\nP. The representative notion\\(^1\\) of the subjective self (ahank\u0101ra) may sometimes be absent from consciousness; for, I believe, everybody, especially in his dreams, has felt himself in a state, however transient, in which he forgot himself. Some of your Western thinkers have laid it down as an established fact that Sensation is in an inverse ratio to Perception.\\(^2\\) The same might be held of the relation of these two phases of Consciousness to Reflection, by which I mean that state which refers the sensation or perception to ourselves, and is weak in proportion to the strength of the latter. An intensely vivid sensation brings us into a state of consciousness in which we are scarcely conscious of ourselves. Now it being settled that some object or other, whether sun or moon, hill or dale, jar or picture, or the mental impression induced thereby, is necessary to our consciousness, such a consciousness cannot be attributed to God contemplated apart from his relation to the world which he created, and before the creation of which he abode in his absolute self, named by the Ved\u00e1ntin Brahma. God contemplated in relation to the world is designated \u012a\u015bvara\u2014the Lord\u2014to whom \u015aankarach\u0101rya almost invariably gives the epithet sarvaj\u00f1a, or universally conscious. \u012a\u015bvara is conscious simultaneously of the whole universe as existing in past, present, and future time, and omniscience can mean nothing but universal consciousness.\n\n\\(^1\\) See Mansel's Metaphysics, p. 364.\n\\(^2\\) Mansel's Metaphysics, p. 70.\nS. But what is this Brahma, then?\n\nP. Brahma is the Absolute God, not conscious of the universe, for he existed before it existed, and abides perfectly independent of all relation to it. His is not the consciousness we have discussed, since it is not determined by objects; it does not, so to speak, depend upon them for its nourishment. Brahma, therefore, is not conscious in the usual limited sense of the term. He is represented in the Upanishads as \u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0928\u093f \u0926\u094d\u0935\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0924\u092e\u0903: \u092f\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u0903: \"Without life, without mind, pure.\" Thus have we come to the truth we sought for in the false charge.\n\nS. If he is not conscious in the sense we understand by that word, is it not but fair to admit that Brahma is an unconscious being?\n\nP. Certainly not; for while the Ved\u00e1ntin denies this mundane transitory consciousness to the Deity, he declares unmistakeably and emphatically His (or rather that He is) Consciousness Absolute. Mark that He and His consciousness are not distinct. To distinguish them would be to postulate two deities.\n\nS. Pardon me, Sir, when I tell you frankly that you seem to me to speak very strangely. If to distinguish between God and His consciousness would amount to the holding of two deities, might you not with equal reason say that I hold two individuals in me, by distinguishing myself and my consciousness? And certainly I am not identical with my consciousness, but it is only an attribute of mine.\n\nP. O! you have chanced to hit upon one of the most important tenets of the Ved\u00e1nta, by thus accidentally marking this difference between your permanent self and the varying modes of your consciousness (buddhi). It is this permanent self partially manifested in you, but pervading all conscious beings, that is the Omnipresent Spirit. \u0924\u0924\u094d \u0938\u0935\u093f\u0924\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0947\u0926\u094d\u092f\u094b\u093d\u0939\u093f \"O \u015aveta-ketu, thou art That.\"\n\nS. But you have overlooked my objection to your phraseology. You identify God with His consciousness, whilst I consider it His attribute, just as my consciousness is an attribute of myself.\nP. You may call your consciousness (buddhi) an attribute of your soul, because it varies, whilst the consciousness (chaitanya) of God is one and unchangeable, hence no such distinction of substance and attribute holds with him.\n\nS. I thank you for having removed a great confusion in my thoughts. I now comprehend clearly the doctrine of Spinoza, Fichte, Hegel, and several other great philosophers of the West who maintain but One Substance, and that substance God.\n\nP. European theologians believe the world to have been created of nothing; in other words, to be nothing in its germ. The Ved\u00e1ntin believes that it was nothing and is nothing apart from the only absolute Being\u2014God. The moment that he withdraws his sustaining energy, the universe ceases to exist.\n\nS. But what fallacy is there in holding that the Deity formed a new being in the world which, since its creation, continues, without his continuous energy, according to certain laws originally established by him?\n\nP. Such a tenet, if it has any meaning, implies the independent existence of the world, though originally it was formed by his will. Now, independent being and absolute being are identical, and a belief that can ascribe to Omnipotence a power to communicate to not-being a being absolute like himself, might as easily ascribe to Him a power to reduce himself into not-being. We thus see that the infinite attributes of God must not be believed to surpass the limits of mutual compatibility. Omnipotence cannot be supposed to include power to annihilate itself, and thus oppose itself to infinite existence. Similarly we see the absurdity of supposing Omnipotence capable of calling forth another omnipotence, or an Absolute Being calling forth another absolute being. The Ved\u00e1ntin saw that the very conception of absolute being excludes duality. According to him, therefore, the being that is not God is not being. What is real in the phenomenal universe is the One God, and as to the multiplicity and change that are visible all around, the Ved\u00e1ntin is compelled to look upon them as an illusion\u2014m\u00e1y\u00e1. But while\nthe Vedanta declares that the phenomenal\u2014the many and the changing\u2014are not real, he confesses his perplexity in ascertaining what this seeming reality is. Whilst he feels certain that God and God alone exists, he in fervent devotion flies to that mysterious and inscrutable power, by which the Deity invests himself with these wondrous environments which at once manifest and hide his presence. In silent adoration he mutters 'Om' (the divine affirmative), 'Yes, Thou Art, but thy ways are beyond my ken.'\n\nS. Let us return to the main subject of our conversation\u2014the Consciousness of Brahma, now that we have sufficiently considered the question of absolute being which is indeed intimately connected therewith.\n\nP. Well, Brahma is that absolute, immutable and everlasting Intelligence which sustains this ever-varying consciousness of ours. It is described as transcending the relation of subject and object, not being dependent on or determined by, the object world. What the rays and the manifold colours which they exhibit are to the sun, what the multitudinous and ever-changing waves are to the ocean, our conscious minds along with the phenomenal world exhibited therein are to that Fountain of Intelligence. It transcends our conception indeed, but on that account is not a nonentity. For the anthropomorphist, unable to realize the conception of an unembodied intelligence, might with equal reason declare that a God destitute of a material body is nothing. As the elemental deity is above the fetish; as the God of infinite wisdom, power, and holiness, with an imperishable form of infinite loveliness, is above the former; as to this embodied deity the personal God of Western theology is superior; as the Vedantic conception of Isvara is perhaps still more philosophical and refined: so above even Isvara is the Supreme Brahma, above all conditions and relations, Pure Intelligence, Pure Bliss, Everlasting.\n\n1 \u092f\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u0928\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0947\u091a\u094d\u091b\u0940\u092f\u092e\u094d\u0964\n2 \u0926\u0947\u0935\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u092f\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093f \u0935\u0930\u0941\u0923\u0940\u0935\u093f\u0928\u094d\u092f\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u092e\u094d\u0964 \u015avet\u0101\u015bvatara Upanishad.\n3 Beloved in by the R\u0101m\u0101nujas.\nmystery by which the absolute Brahma brings himself into relation to the universe as I\u015bvara, or the Personal Deity, is variously designated m\u0101y\u0101 (illusion), \u015bakti (power), and prak\u1e5biti (nature). This inscrutable principle, when contemplated in connexion with the Deity, takes the name of Power and loses its separate identity, for God and his power cannot be conceived as distinct. But when it is thought of in connexion with the universe, it becomes distinct from God and is termed Illusion. For the universe, or the aggregate of the phenomenal being nothing but the evanescent modes of the consciousnesses of living beings, has no permanent existence or substantiality. It should never, however, be forgotten, as is often done even by Pandits, that the doctrine of illusion is a confession rather than a solution of the mystery of creation. It is an interpretation only so far as it explains the fallacies of false interpretations. As Professor Ferrier says, the light of every truth is its contrasting error. So it was itself in opposition to the Pradh\u0101na-v\u0101da, or theory of blind nature, held by the S\u0101\u1e45khya; to the Param\u0101\u1e47a-v\u0101da, the atomic theory, of the Naiy\u0101yikas; to the Vi\u00f1\u0101na-v\u0101da and Sa\u1e45ga-v\u0101da, Absolute Idealism and Nihilism, of the respective Baudh\u0101ya\u1e47a sects.\n\n---\n\n**N\u0101ma and R\u016bpa:** the soul of the phenomenal world, seeming to be one with itself in connection with, but having their origin in the absence of true knowledge, are distinguished by identification (with God) or differentiation (from Him), are named in the Veda and Supra the Illusion, Power, or Nature of the universally conscious God.

I see that in Brahma the Ved\u00e1ntin has attempted to form a conception of the Deity freed from the slightest tincture of material ideas, but at the same time I find it difficult to believe in a Being which transcends my conception.\n\nP. I understand your difficulty, but let me try to remove it. Just consider whether you can realize in conception the conscious souls of other men. You can not. Your belief in other souls than yourself is founded on an inference, and not on an immediate cognition; you are only cognizant of their material forms and words. Further, I ask, can you realize in conception your own self, that continues one and the same through all its varying modes of consciousness, that seeming to be changed in pleasure and pain still preserves its mysterious identity? Were you to conceive yourself, you would make yourself a mode of your consciousness, and thus make the whole a part of itself, or rather the support itself, the supported. You still, however, believe in yourself as the permanent one underlying or supporting the varied succession of sensations and impressions. Thus God, though not conceivable, must be believed in as the Absolute Intelligence, supporting through our conscious souls the whole universe. As the material universe merges into our conscious souls, so do our conscious souls merge into that One, eternal and unfathomable Flood of Consciousness\u2014Brahma. The relation of the external world to the animal soul, and that of the animal soul to the Lord, are remarkably summed up in the following couplet, quoted from the \u015ar\u012bva-dr\u0131\u1e63\u1e6di, in the Philosophy of Divine Recognition, a noble specimen of Indian philosophical analysis:\n\nThe Pandit, vol. ii. p. 241.\n\n1 \"How could one know the knower!\"\u2014Brihadaranyaka Upanishad.\n\n2 The Pratyabhijn\u0101 Darsana, which bears a close affinity to the Ved\u0101nta. Both systems are at one in their main doctrines, but whilst the latter reaps princ-\n\"The jar is conscious through myself, and I am conscious through the self of the jar. I am conscious through the self of Sadyasaiva, and He is conscious through myself.\" That is to say, as the existence of so-called external objects depends upon the consciousness of living creatures, which in its turn is determined by the former, so the conscious existence of living creatures depends upon the Divine consciousness, which is determined by the totality of intelligences in the conscious universe. God is the spirit conscious of the universe. Whilst an extremely limited portion, and that only of the material universe, enters into my consciousness, the whole of the conscious universe, together, of course, with the material one that hangs upon it, enters into the consciousness of God. Perhaps it would not be too bold to say that the doctrine enunciated above embodies the highest possible human attempt to form a conception of the transcendently immeasurable Divine intelligence.\n\nAccording to this view then, we are to God what matter is to us. As matter analysed into sensations rests in ourselves, so do ourselves rest in the One Universal Self. This harmonises with St. Paul's teaching, \"In Him, we live, move, and have our being.\" But this Universal Self is (surely) the himself rests in Brahma\u2014the Absolute, the Infinite.\n\nIs it not?\n\nYes.\n\nBut does not the doctrine that holds God to be the soul of the universe subvert His personality?\n\nTo hold that the Divine consciousness in its objective aspect, that is to say, as far as it is related to objects, is the reality of the consciousness of living beings, no more detracts from His personality (unless finite intelligence or magnified humanity is what is meant by the term), than to hold that\n\n---\n\n*Note:* The above text discusses and analyzes our consciousness.\nmy own outer consciousness is composed of what is called matter takes away my personality. No more again is the Divine Person affected by the cognitions, feelings and volitions and acts of living souls, than my own self is affected by the actions and changes of matter, excepting only that part which is more intimately connected with me, viz. my organic frame.\n\nS. According to this showing, myself, though an element in the external consciousness of God, is distinct from His absolute self. But does not the Brahma-vadu, or Vedantic Absolutist, hold my soul identical with God?\n\nP. You must always remember that there are two ways of thinking and speaking of the soul, answering to the two distinct names Paramatma (Supreme or Transcendental Soul), and Jivatma (Animal or Conscious Soul). The soul has been defined by some to be one that knows, feels, and wills. Nor is it denied that, whether happy or miserable, one feels himself one and the same. How can you reconcile the contradiction that the miserable is the same with the happy self? Either call pain and pleasure an illusion, or call yourself, i.e. the unchanging self, an illusion, and so they have actually done, and thus have arisen the two principal classes of thinkers, the Positivists or Phenomenalists and the Absolutists.\n\nS. I will try to remove, by a material analogy, the queer contradiction you have made out. As my eyes and ears, though differently affected by agreeable and disagreeable sights and sounds, are not materially changed, so myself, though distinctly affected by pain and pleasure, am not changed in my real nature.\n\nP. Well, then, these two distinct circumstances respectively point to two distinct selves. As the matter of my optic nerves is not changed under their varied affections, so the spiritual substance of my soul is not changed in spite of the modifications my outer consciousness undergoes. And it is this unchanged self (call it transcendental if you like) that is the manifestation of God. We are not indeed directly\n\n1 Called also Prj\u00f1\u0101natma.\nconscious of it, for being the subject, we cannot make it the object of consciousness. Nevertheless, its existence is implied in the very fact of consciousness. I know it so far (and indeed that is sufficient knowledge) that I, the mutably conscious self, cannot exist but in and through that Immutable Self. Thus, according to the Ved\u00e1nta, the Unchanging Soul is Param\u00e1tm\u00e1 (supreme soul); and the unchanging soul seeming to be changed is Jiv\u00e1tm\u00e1 (animal soul). Inasmuch as the unchanging self seems to be changed, and the changing outer consciousness (buddhi) seems to be the self; these two are often confounded together. The varying modes which my existence passes through are called modes of my consciousness. Entirely different as they are mutually, they all go by the name of consciousness. There must then be some common element in all these modes which leads to the application of the common name of consciousness. This element can be no other than myself. Abstracted from their differentiating features, the differing modes of consciousness are unified in Me. I, the subject, am one with pure undifferenced consciousness, purged from the ever-varying matter which lends its colour to it (as the red hybiscus flower does to the colourless crystal), and which, therefore, is not I the unchanged. It is true that consciousness in its human form cannot be realized, except in relation to the subject and the object, yet it is admitted by all to be much more intimately connected with the former than the latter, unless indeed both of them are absolutely identified with it.\n\nS.

Nay, more: not only is every special experience which constitutes the matter of consciousness alien to and separable from the personality of the subject; but, etc.\"\n\nP. Well, then, the I, free from \"every special experience alien to and separable from the personality of the subject,\" free from all earthly feelings of joy and sorrow is the Paramatma\u2014Pure and 'Essential' Consciousness\u2014\u0935\u093f\u0937\u092f\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u093e: \u092a\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0937\u0903 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0923\u092e\u094d.\n\nS. But what right have you to call this pure consciousness I or Self, when I am never conscious of myself, except in relation to an object?\n\nP. I do not call this pure consciousness self because I ever feel (which I do not) my mutably conscious self identified with it, but because I feel clearly enough that I, the subject, am never separable from consciousness, whilst every particular object is successively separated from it. And he who feels himself unable to believe in a pure consciousness has no right to believe in a God whose consciousness, as I have already said, must be believed to be independent of the object world, which He created. It has been declared that consciousness is not possible except in relation to the subject and the object. Avoiding the term 'relation,' which is somewhat vague as used in respect of consciousness, the same fact may be enun-\n\n1 Mansel's Metaphysics, p. 359.\nstated thus: consciousness in its human form almost invariably manifests itself in two phases\u2014the self and the not-self. The self-phase, which is essential to and inseparable from it, is characterized by unity and permanency. The not-self-phase, which is accidental and separable, is characterized by diversity and succession. This latter has distinctive and exclusive names in Sanskrit, viz. buddhi, antakarana, manah. It cannot, without ambiguity, be represented in English by a single word, but the phrase 'outer consciousness' may tolerably answer to it. As consciousness, in its essential form, is identical with self, the unmodified, it is buddhi that is said to undergo modifications, and not consciousness proper. It (buddhi) is defined to be the internal sense successively assuming the forms of external objects.\n\nN. In the beginning of our conversation, I remember you did not lay much stress upon the notion of the subject as an element of consciousness, and now, driving the object altogether to the background, you make the subject the very essence thereof. Is it not a palpable self-contradiction?\n\nP. When I have made this remark, I have done so with reference to the 'outer consciousness,' buddhi, in which sense I have at the outset generally used the term consciousness. Although I have remarked that the 'representative notion' of self (aha\u1e45k\u0101ra) is stronger or weaker inversely as the objective element is stronger or weaker, it must be distinctly remembered that what Dr. Mansel calls the 'presented self,' pratyangatma, must always continue to underlie consciousness. The mysterious something which is not-self, yet depends upon self, and, in its turn, makes self seem to depend upon it, is God's illusive power, his indirect manifestation. This consciousness again, which with far greater distinctness presents itself as self, though tinged by the mysterious not-self, is His direct manifestation. The buddhi, being more intimately connected with external objects than with the internal subject, is declared to be jad\u00e1 or unconscious, and derives its semblance of consciousness from the conscious soul. It is\n\n1 Metaphysics, p. 364.\nthe medium between the internal subject and the external object, partaking of the character of both. The Paramatma may be compared to white unreflected light pervading space, and the Jivatma to the same light reflected upon various objects and presenting various hues. As the former, though visible indeed, nay the cause of universal vision, yet seems to be less clearly manifested than the latter reflected, for instance, upon a broad white wall; so the Paramatma, though the manifest source of universal consciousness, yet seems manifested only when reflected upon buddhi, the internal material of external objects. Nay, more; as material objects, though they reflect but the colours contained in light, seem to present their own colours, so the phenomenal world, though reflecting what are mysteriously contained in the white light of pure consciousness reflected therein, seems to present its own shapes. As the many colours are inexplicably contained in the white light, without, in the least, affecting its whiteness, so the many phenomena of the world are mysteriously contained in Pure Consciousness, without, in the least, affecting its purity.\n\nS. It seems indeed as if the visible material light were created to furnish in its marvellous phenomena exact parallels to the all-wonderful manifestations of that invisible yet universally visible Spiritual Light\u2014Brahma. But I cannot by any means reconcile this Pure and Passive Consciousness, though self-luminous and illuminating Nature, with active Omnipotence and Mercy ruling the universe.\n\nP. I have already declared that God in relation to the universe is not pure consciousness, but is named kabala Brahma, varisha Brahma (conditioned or personal God), or I'becarn (the Lord). Whilst the field of our consciousness is extremely limited, that of I'scara is infinite. Whilst our will has but a semblance of freedom, being determined by motives, which again are determined by an intricate tissue of moral and physical causes; the will of the Lord is deter-\n\n*Called also skahin (witness), from being presented yet unaffected.*\n\nBhuma.\nmined, in the dispensation of rewards and punishments only, by the respective actions of rational creatures in their successive states of existence. Whilst our will cannot surpass the laws of nature (or can counteract, on an extremely meagre scale, i.e. in our bodily movements, that of gravitation only), those laws are nothing but the determinate operation of His will or power. Thus whilst we are subject to M\u0101y\u0101 or Nature, she is subject to Him. Whilst we are controlled by the many and changing and are scarcely conscious of our essential selves, He projects them, as it were, out of himself, and is yet unaffected in his absolute consciousness. How Nature is contained in Him, and yet is not essentially one with Him, I have repeatedly declared to be a mystery.\n\nS. But does not the Vedantic doctrine of non-duality destroy man's moral and religious obligations?\u00b9\n\nP. There is not a more pernicious mistake than such a supposition. The doctrine can scarcely have any practical bearing, pointing, as it does, to a state which transcends all relations and conditions, and is therefore above the sphere of practice. The Ved\u0101ntin may earnestly labour to release himself from duality, but in the course of his endeavours, up to the last moment that he is conscious of this duality, he is but a mortal,\u00b2 and, as such, subject to the ordinances of religion and morality. Nay, devotion to God, the Lord and\n\n\u00b9 The question itself is possible only under the conditions of duality, and so the answer too must be one that relates to a state of duality alone. For a man to consider whether he should act in this or that particular manner, it is necessary that he should perceive difference, and if he does perceive difference, he has no right to act in any other manner than that prescribed by the moral and religious laws ordained under the conditions of duality. If, however, through stupidity he argues himself into the commission of sin, in mistaken conformity with Vedantic non-duality, in spite of his actual consciousness of duality, purgatorial fires would be the inevitable consequence of such an act, and he would feel them neither more nor less really than he was conscious of the act itself. Thus all objections to the doctrine on the ground of morality are utterly untenable.\n\n\u00b2 \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0935\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093e\u092f\u093e\u092e\u0947\u0935 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0915\u094d \u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0935\u093f\u091a\u094d\u091b\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0924\u094d \u0938\u0916\u0932\u094b\u092a\u092a\u0924\u093f: \u0938\u092e\u0935-\u0935\u0939\u093e\u0930\u0902 \u0915\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0935 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0915\u094d \u092c\u094b\u0927\u093e\u0924\u094d\n\n\"As before waking, all the perceptions and acts of a dream are felt as true, so before the recognition of the identity of the Divine and human soul, all perceptions and acts are properly regarded as true.\"\u2014Sankara's Brahma\u015b\u016btra-bh\u0101sya, p. 449.\nFather of all, with a heart free from every stain of impurity, along with the practice of the virtues of forgiveness and charity, contentment and truth, and an entire control of the senses and passions, are distinctly and emphatically declared to be the only means towards the attainment of the very right or capacity (adhik\u0101ra) to seek the highest truth\u2014that God is the only truth.

Since, as God, the sole truth, there exists the subjective consciousness underlying the (phenomenally) false Veda\u2014which teaches the absolute unity of God\u2014That is to say the objectivity of the Veda along with that of every thing else is false, but the subjective consciousness that God is the only reality is true. This indeed might have been said, if consciousness itself had been belied, apart from its objective multiplicity. And this is far from being done, consciousness being held to be the residuum of truth. As the objectivity of waking consciousness is founded in the waking, but not its subjectivity, so the objectivity of waking consciousness itself is founded in the Divine objectless Intelligence.\nthemselves are falsified by being represented by false words composed of written letters. Nay the black written letters of a book, though themselves but falsely visible, inform men of things perceptible to all the senses. As, in the ordinary sense, the substance of the ink is not unreal, but its attribute of visibility; so, in the Vedantic view, the pure existence which underlies phenomena is not unreal, but the attribute of change and variety. The ink seems to be visible, while it is the white paper that is really so. Similarly the world seems to present different appearances to the senses, whilst the real manifestation belongs to Him.\n\n\"Om sahasrakshara varahamahesvaraya deva vajra varaha pratishtaye.\"\n\nSvetasvatara Upanishad.\n\n\"Him only shining, all this shines after: this universe shines through His light!\"\nART. III.\u2014An Account of the Island of Bali.\n\nBy R. FRIEDERICH.\n\n[Continued from Vol. IX, n.s. p. 120.]\n\nTHE PRINCELY FAMILIES.\n\nWe have already referred briefly to the fact that all the Xatriyan princes, and all the present Xatriyas, trace their descent to the Deva Agung. The princes and Gustis of Tabanan and Badong are descended from Arya Damar; and, finally, the princes and Gustis of Mengwi, Karang-Assem, Buleleng and Lombok derive their pedigree from Patih Gaja Madda. This carries us back to the time of the conquest of Bali by the Javanese of Majapahit.\n\nAn ancient connexion between Java and Bali is indicated in the Usana Bali. Bali was in the possession of evil spirits or giants, that is, the Balinese were not yet Hindus (comp. Abdullah, in the Tijdsch. voor Neerlands Indi\u00eb, 7, 2, p. 160, sqq.). A few Hindus from Majapahit had settled in Bali, and had a temple in Bazuki (so called after the Indian serpent-king Wasuki, who, in the Indian and Balinese mythology, accompanies Siva and plays an important part). They were oppressed, however, by the infidel princes and people. The account of the descent of the gods and the defeat of the Maya Danawa and the demons indicates the triumph of Hinduism. The Usana Bali does not tell us by what earthly means this religion was established, and the reason of this seems to be, (1) that, in order to attain its full sanctity, the religion must be introduced by the gods themselves, (2) that it was desirable or necessary to spare the feelings of the conquered people (the original Balinese), by representing them as conquered not by men but by gods. The Usana Bali is intended only for the people.\n\nIn the Usana Java, however, we find traces of the true conquest. It is represented, here, as taking place immediately before the crossing over of the Deva Agung, the chief of Majapahit; but at that time Bali (according to the same Usana Java) had already become a province of the kingdom\nof Majapahit, and is merely subdued a second time after a revolt of the governor. The institution of castes and the Hindu religion evidently existed in Bali previously to this, as is clear also from the narrative of Abdullah; but the revolt and the defeat of the Governor of Bali afforded an opportunity of dividing the land among the nobles of Majapahit, and the prince of Majapahit, or his son, came to reside in this island after the fall of the kingdom of Majapahit. This destruction of Majapahit was effected, according to the Javanese accounts, by Muhammadans; according to the Balinese, the kingdom and city were deserted in consequence of a disease caused by a buta (demon).\n\nAccording to the Usana Java, Arya Damar and Patih Gaja Madda were sent from Majapahit in the capacity of generals against the rebellious Bali. Arya Damar conquers the north, while Patih Gaja Madda remains inactive in the south; but, on the approach of Arya Damar, the latter portion also submits to this victorious general. The crossing over of the prince of Majapahit is caused, according to the Usana Java, by the appearance in Bali of a demoniacal king, Mraja Danawa (another infidel, therefore!); the latter is of the family of Maya Danawa in the Usana Bali, and refers to the event that forms the subject of that writing. At that time Arya Damar was in Majapahit, and on the receipt of the intelligence that this Raksasa Mraja Danawa is exercising his power in Bali, the prince of Majapahit himself sets out against Bali with Arya Damar and his whole army; after defeating the Raksasa prince, who, when he can resist no longer, flies away through the air, the prince of Majapahit establishes himself in Gelgel. This account is obviously improbable, and was perhaps invented to conceal from the original Balinese the manner in which, and the reasons for which, the prince of Majapahit, or his son, left his kingdom to settle in Bali.\n\nWhat would seem nearest the truth in these accounts is\n\n1 The Usana Java does not give the name of the prince who became the first Deva Agung in Bali. According to other accounts, his name was Deva Agung K'tut, and this is given by Raffles and confirmed by the Balinese.\nthis: Arya Damar had subdued rebellious Bali, and again compelled respect for the prince of Majapahit, a short time afterwards the kingdom of Majapahit fell to the ground (through war or other disasters), and the surviving prince, or one of his sons, came over to peaceful Bali. The Balinese naturally regard this arrival as an honour, and look upon the loss of Majapahit as of little moment, for they say that place (and all Java) became infested with evil spirits. The princes do not seem to have so easily forgotten the loss of their great kingdom in Java; hence their continual wars with Blambangan, and even in Pasuruan (Raffles, vol. ii. p. 200, sqq., History of Java), whence, however, they finally had to withdraw. Blambangan (the country near Banjucang) for a long time still belonged to Bali. The wilderness of this country is partly owing to the wars with the Balinese, who were unable to hold it. It is remarkable that the opposite side of Bali, Jembrana, is also, to a great extent, desolate; here, as in Majapahit, the reason of this desolation is said to be that the dwelling of a king of demoniacal form made the land unsafe. But both Jembrana and Blambangan were really laid waste by the long wars between Java and Bali, and, even now, are little cultivated, more for security's sake than from fear of the demoniacal king. The longing of the Balinese to regain their lost country has shown itself in the expedition of the Boelelangers against Banjucang under the English rule. They have also attempted to gain in the East what they have lost in the West\u2014hence the conquest of Lombok and the attack on Sembawa, where they were stopped by the Dutch Government.\n\nAfter the settlement of the Deva Agung in Bali at Gelgel, the land is divided among the chief men in the army and the court. Arya Damar received the great land of Tabanan, and became a Patih, first minister of the Deva Agung. The prince could not undertake anything without consulting him, and this privilege descends to his offspring, and forms the ground of the present grievances of the princes of Tabanan and Badung, who never forget this ancient privilege, and, as the Deva Agung does not keep the old promise.\nno longer consider themselves bound to him. Badong, however, preserves, for political reasons, the appearance of subjection. Arya Damar also obtains the title of Arya K\u00eanc\u00eang (K\u00eanj\u00eang or K\u00eangj\u00eang is the title for princely Javanese invested with authority, and is also given to the Resident, the Government, etc.). The number of his men is said to have been 40,000. Smaller governorships were also given to Arya Damar's brothers; to Arya Sento, the countries of Pachung, the present Marga, belonging formerly to Mengui, but now to Tabanan; to Arya Beleteng, the country of Pinatih, since conquered by the princes of Badong, but still a separate kingdom; to Arya Warringin, that of Kapal in the present Mengui; to Arya Blog, that of Kabakaba in Mengui; to Arya Kapakisan, that of Habiansmal in Mengui; to Arya Binchaluku, that of Tangkas in Klongkong. Besides these brothers of Arya Damar, Arya Manguri is mentioned as governor in Dawuh in Karang-Assem, and the three principal Wesyas, Tan Kuber, Tan Kawur and Tan Mundur (names, really, symbolical), also receive a domain. In the Pamendanga, a sort of history of the princes and priests, however of little value, the governorships allotted to these nobles are somewhat different, but, at any rate, this work mentions Patih Gaja Madda as governor of Mengui, a fact confirmed by all Balinese, but omitted from the Usana Java.\u00b9 We thus see Bali, at the very outset, divided among governors; these could soon change from governors into independent princes, such as we now find. In the year 1633, according to the Dutch Envoys, the Deva Agung seems still to have been the only prince in Bali, and it is probable that he was regarded as such and had influence over the whole of Bali until about 100 years ago, when Gelgel, his ancient seat, was destroyed. The countries adjoining Klongkong, Bangli, Gianyar, and also Boleleng, seem to have been immediately under the Deva Agung, and were then, in course of time, given as governorships to members of his family. Here also, after the degradation of the race of the Arya Damar, were the\n\n\u00b9 The Usana Bali betrays partiality for the race of Arya Damar.\nonly remaining Xatriyas, but even these were partly expelled by the Wesyas. The history of Arya Damar's descendants is remarkable only on account of the conquest of Badong and the founding of this kingdom. The race of Pathi Gaja Madda has much more influence upon the history of the whole of Bali. This chief, the second general of the princes of Majapahit, had his seat in Mengui. The palace of Mengui is one of the oldest. Abdullah (p. 163) even makes the Deva Agung reside in Mengui from the first; the information I have obtained as to this point, however, agrees with the Usana Java, where the Deva Agung has his first seat in Gelgel; proceeding subsequently to Klongkong. To Mengui belonged, besides the present country of that name, the greater portion of Badong (the smaller, eastern portion of Badong, formed the kingdom of Pinatih, which in later times was subject to Mengui); and, further, a portion of the present Gianyar, Kramar, and the land of Marga, which now belongs to Tabanan. It was thus a considerable domain, and as large, if not larger, than Tabanan. Arya Damar's brothers had, it is true, various portions of the present Mengui, but they all appear to have been speedily subjected to the power of Gaja Madda and his successors; the kingdom of Pinatih alone remained under the descendants of Arya Damar, but it became tributary to Mengui. The position of Bali at this period (about 250 years ago) may therefore be thus described: Klongkong, Gianyar (with the exception of Krmaas), Bangli, and Buleleng, belonged to the Deva Agung and to punggawas (governors) of his family; Tabanan to the descendants of Arya Dama; Mengui with Badong and parts of Gianyar and Tabanan (Kramar and Marga) to the descendants of Gaja Madda. Karang-Assem was probably still under the descendants of Arya Manguri (at least partially). A change in this state of affairs was caused by the princes of Mengui conquering Karang-Assem, and a Gusti of Tabanan establishing himself and his descendants in Badong, and forming a separate independent kingdom, after being for a time subject to Mengui.\n\nAnother and a more important change began about 100\nyears ago, in consequence of the war of Karang-Assem against Klongkong. The cause of this war was the putting to death of a prince of Karang-Assem, by command of the Deva Agung. The prince in question did penance after the manner of the Indian yogis; he gave himself up entirely to contemplation, and, thereby, neglected all outward worldly things so much that he grossly transgressed decorum, e.g. he allowed his excrement to fall where he happened to be sitting. When he was in Klongkong, he conducted himself in the same manner, and thus offended the Deva Agung and the nobles of the court of Gelgel. On his return journey, he was killed from an ambush by command of the Deva Agung. He left three sons, who immediately resolved to avenge his death. The penance performed by their murdered father rendered their power irresistible in the eyes of the Balinese; the real fact is, however, that the race of Gaja Madda, which then possessed all the extensive country of Mengui and Karang-Assem, was the most powerful in Bali. They defeated the Deva Agung and destroyed his royal seat in Gelgel. The Deva Agung retained his territory, however, and seems, from this time forward, to have fallen into the state of dependence under the Karang-Assem family in which we now find him. Peace was restored by marriages, and Klongkong was held in subjection. The wife of the Deva Agung last-deceased was a princess of Karang-Assem, and governed the whole land for him so completely that she even dared to murder another wife of her husband, a princess of Badong. From this time the decline of the power of the Deva Agung is principally to be dated. He was a conquered prince, and, although he retained his territory, and the conqueror remained in outward appearance his inferior, yet his prestige among his own people was seriously lowered. In addition to this, the princes of Kareng-Assem no longer performed feudal service in Klongkong, but simply conceded to the Deva Agung the title of first ruler of Bali, without paying him tribute.\n\nThis victory had yet other important consequences for the family of Karang-Assem. The conquerors of Klongkong\ncould without much difficulty also attack Boleleng, where dynasties had already changed several times, and which at that time was certainly in a weak state. They took this country also, and one of the brothers became king of Boleleng. At that time the most ancient dynasty of the Xatriyas had already ceased to exist in Boleleng;\u00b9 the statements of the people of Badong asserting, that it was driven from the throne seven generations ago, retiring to Badong, where it still lives, subordinate to the ruling Wesyas, but yet of some distinction. (Its head is the Deva Made Rahi in Kutta, who has obtained the chief command of that place from the rajas of Badong.) One of the succeeding princes of Boleleng, also of Wesyan blood (being descended from Arya Beleteng in Pinatih), was Panji; he, however, did not hold the kingdom long. Whether he expelled the Xatriyas is not certain, nor is it known whether the family of Karang-Assam immediately succeeded him.\n\nThe last exploit of the victorious brothers of Karang-Assam was the conquest of Lombok. Here, also, one of the brothers remained as prince, keeping 5000 Balinese families with him, from whom the present Balinese population of Lombok have sprung.\n\nIn the south, the Gusti family from Tabanan had, in the mean time, subdued the whole of the western portion of Badong, namely, Pinatih: the eastern portion was conquered somewhat later.\n\nAbout the same time (three generations ago) the family of the Deva Agung was also robbed of its possessions in Gianyar, and an inferior Deva (Pungkun), named Deva Mangis, founded the present kingdom of Gianyar.\n\nA hundred years later, therefore, we have the following state of affairs in Bali: (1) The Deva Agung in Klongkong, only in name still prince of all Bali, and with his territory reduced to Bangli and Klongkong. Bangli, however, had its own princes, who were also Xatriyas and descended from the Deva Agung, but of lower birth than the Xatriyas in\n\n\u00b9 This is open to doubt. In that case how can Xatriyas have ruled in Boleleng in Crawford's time (1812)?\nKlongkong. In Gianyar the relations of the Deva Agung were conquered by a Deva of insignificant rank. (2) The family of Gaja Madda ruling in Mengui, Karang-Assem, Boleleng, and Lombok. Mengui, their original country, had, however, already lost a large piece of territory to the newly-arisen Badong. (3) The family of Arya Damar in Tabanan and in the newly-founded Badong.\n\nSince that time there have still been quarrels without end among the eight states which we have mentioned. We say eight, for Pahyangan was not a separate state, but belonged formerly to Bangli, and now to Mengui, and Jembrana has also, always, or for a very long time, been subject to Boleleng\u2014it was conquered twenty years ago by Badong, but retaken by Boleleng.\n\nThe most frequent wars have been between Badong and Mengui, with its allies Karang-Assem and Boleleng; and between Gianyar and Mengui, allied with Bangli. The new kingdoms of Badong and Gianyar soon became allies, although they have had a few small wars with each other, when one has been for and the other against the party of the Deva Agung. In general, they maintain friendly relations with the Deva Agung, pay him homage, and send him a few presents. To show the present condition of Bali, we will now speak of each state in particular.\n\n1. Klongkong, governed by the Deva Agung, is the smallest, and is not a rich country. His men are said to number 6000. Formerly there were members of his family in Nagara, Sukawati, and Pejeng (all in the present Gianyar); the family also had Boleleng, but it was driven out thence and went to Badong. In Bangli, also, the Xatriyan family is no longer related to the Deva Agung, but down to the most recent period, the Xatriyas of Bangli were always true followers of, and paid homage to, those of Klongkong. At present, Bangli and Klongkong are bitter enemies. Gianyar, Badong, and Mengui acknowledge the authority of the Deva Agung by presents and envoys. Karang-Assem and Boleleng acknowledge him as supreme prince, but pay him no homage, and, although they act in full harmony with Klong-\nkong, they do so as an entirely independent state. Towards the Dutch Government, however, they make use of the pretended power of the Deva Agung, in order to represent their acts as controlled by the Deva Agung, and to take refuge behind him. Tabanan, Bangli, and Lombok do not even acknowledge the superior rank of the Deva Agung, much less give him presents.\n\nThe name of the present Deva Agung is G'de Putra; his sister, the daughter of the above-mentioned princess of Karang-Assem, is named Deva Agung Istri. The Deva Agung's mother was a Sudra-woman, but the deceased Deva Agung had no male children by noble wives, and thus the son of a Sudra-woman was obliged to succeed him.\n\n2. Gianyar. This state is governed by Deca Pahan, a son of Deva Mangis, who died in October, 1847. The family is Xatriyan, but of low descent (on account of too much inter-mixture with Sudra blood), and is called punggawan (punggawan means fallen). Deva Pahan's great-grandfather, named Deva Mangis, was the founder of this state. He was commander of 200 men in the desa of Gianyar, and was under the Punggawans of the Deva Agung, who were governors in Nagara, Sukawati, and Pejeng, and relations of the ruling Deva Agung. By deceit, violence, and poison he gained the mastery over these punggawans, and conquered from Mengwi the country of Kramas. On account of his infamous deeds, his poisoning, etc., he is said to have changed after death into a serpent, which was kept for a long time in the palace at Gianyar, but disappeared in the last few years. His success in all his undertakings was probably owing to the fact that he began in a time when Klungkong was defeated by Karang-Assem, and deprived of all power. Gianyar, however, has\n\n---\n\nG'de means the oldest son or daughter of the same mother, among other than royal persons, and namesake of the father. Thus the Wayahban (old) Manu is the second, really the middle one, Sansarii made a Syam, the third; if there be a fourth, A'tut, the third or fourth; really the youngest; if there are more children, the same expressions are used, but are placed before the name instead of after it. Thus we have in Leon Piasar a raja Nyuruh A'tut, and a K'tut Nyuruh, both sons of the deceased prince, the brother of Kassaman. Pia's a prince, but ought properly to be applied only to those of purely noble birth; in this case, however, the Deva Agung is the son of a Sudra woman, but, as the only one who could succeed to the throne, he was enthroned.\nsubmitted to the Deva Agung as the supreme ruler, and sends him numerous presents, which cause him to forget that his nearest relatives are disgracefully oppressed\u2014for the former punggawas are still living in Gianyar, but they are under the command of a Pungakan. It thus appears that, all over Bali, noble birth is not sufficient to protect a family. Here, too, the stronger conquers, even though he be of the lowest extraction. Such a victorious family is then again elevated by noble marriages. Gianyar is stated to contain 35,000 men, but not more than half this return can be taken as true. It is one of the most fertile and best-cultivated districts of Bali.\n\nGianyar is allied with Badong, and acts as mediator in the disputes between this state and Klongkong. Its attitude towards Karang-Assem is neither friendly nor hostile. In the last Dutch expedition against Buleleng, Gianyar, by command of the Deva Agung, sent 5000 men to assist; they arrived too late, however, and were not the best soldiers; but, on the contrary, the refuse of the kingdom.\n\nGianyar has had many quarrels under the three princes bearing the name of Deva Mangis, chiefly with Bangli and Mengui, but also with other states. At the conquest of Mengui by Badong, Gianyar was allied with the latter, and received a piece of territory on the frontier, Kadewatan. Gianyar\u2019s friendship towards Badong is not to be relied on; hence the new campongs built by the raja Kassiman on the frontier of Badong.\n\n3. Bangli. The reigning prince is Deva G\u2019d\u00e9 Putu Tangkeban.\\(^1\\) His family also is descended from the first Deva Agung in Klongkong, but in rank it stands lower than the line of the Deva Agungs. Formerly this family ruled over two states\u2014Bangli and Taman-Bali. This close relationship was not sufficient to prevent the prince of the former state from seizing the latter and extirpating its princes. The same thing has, however, occurred to the families of Karang-Assem and of Lombok. Until about ten years ago, Bangli was\n\n\\(^1\\) *Putu* is applied to a person at whose birth the grandfather or grandmother is still living. The word *w\u2019ka*, etc.\nattached to Klongkong; the prince of Bangli, the most warlike in Bali, was commander-in-chief (Sempati). Its enmity with Klongkong was brought about by the influence of the princess of Karang-Assem, who was married to the deceased Deva Agung. In its many wars with Karang-Assem, Buleleng and Gianyar, however, it lost part of its territory in the north, and lately also Pahyangan, which lies south of Bangli, and is now divided from Bangli itself by a strip of territory acquired by Gianyar. Pahyangan has been won by Buleleng and ceded by this state to the Deva Agung, who again has handed it over to the government of the prince of Mengwi, his Pungrawa.\n\nBangli no longer acknowledges the Deva Agung, and has entered into friendly relations with Tabanan and Badong, which, however, the surrounding hostile states render of little account. The war with Gianyar has recently been stopped through the influence of Badong. The country has also suffered nothing from Karang-Assem and Buleleng since the first Dutch expedition; now, however, it is in great danger from the union of these two states and of Klongkong and Mengwi. The men of Bangli are the bravest in Bali, and it is only by virtue of this quality that they have been able to hold their own against so many powerful enemies. Women also bear arms in this country. There are only fifty firearms in Bangli.1\n\n1 The above, like all the rest of this Account, was written in 1848. The third expedition despatched by the Dutch Government against the hostile states in Bali at that time very much assisted in the execution of several plans etc. The author has thought it desirable, however, not to alter his work after the accounts, but to describe them in the state in which it was when he left it. Now that Buleleng, Karang-Assem, and Bangli are better known, the public will of course have fresh information regarding them, hitherto however, but little that is authentic has come to the author's ears, and he therefore gives the information which he has gathered, to serve as far as possible as historical data. It is well known that the prince of Bangli, the faithful ally of the Dutch Government, has now, in addition to his own possessions, those of Gianyar, and that the latter state has been raised under the sovereignty of Holland, also that Karang-Assem has been given to the prince of Mataram-Lombok, who believed he had a well-founded claim to it. The aid, etc., of the Deva Agung has also been still further lessened, both because he has been compelled to acknowledge the sovereignty of Holland, and because the princes, who previously did not recognize his authority, have now been made powerful and dreaded neighbours, who will always be ready and able to help themselves. To avoid repetition, we may here only allude to the fact that the princes Gunung, Karang-Assem, Buleleng, and Karang-Assem, and the still better-known Gianyar Jlaneg, have fallen in the struggle.\n4. Mengui. The reigning prince is Anak Agung K'tut Agung. He murdered his elder brother, who was the first prince; the widow of the latter, Byang Agung, however, still has much influence. The families of Karang-Assem, Boleleng, and Lombok, are of Menguian extraction. Patih Gaja Madda was governor of Mengui. According to some accounts, this Patih Gaja Madda was an incarnation of Wishnu, who has thus also assumed the body of a Wesya. The story probably originated when the family had subdued nearly the whole of Bali and Lombok. Another account says that Patih Gaja Madda vanished from the earth and left no children, the house of Mengui being descended from Ki Yasak, who married the granddaughter of Arya Damar against the will of her father Arya Yasan. In ancient times Mengui included the whole of western Badong, while the eastern portion, the state of Pinatih, also acknowledged the supremacy of Mengui among the descendants of Arya Beleteng. Besides this, Kramas and Kadevatan of Gianyar and Marga, in the mountain range of Tabanan, formerly belonged to Mengui. Kramas was conquered by Gianyar, as we have seen; we shall speak of the rest in connexion with Badong. Mengui was for some time, about twelve years, under the dominion of Badong, but is now again free from that kingdom and stands as a separate governorship under Klongkong. The house of Mengui is not only of the same origin as that of Karang-Assem, but is also allied to it by a very recent marriage between the prince of Karang-Assem and a princess of Mengui. Mengui must obey blindly the orders of the Deva Agung; it is, however, hostile to Badong and Tabanan, and is nearly neutralized by its position between these two states. The small piece of territory belonging to Mengui on the sea-coast is very much coveted by Badong, which, by obtaining it, would touch the frontier of its ally Tabanan. This piece of territory, however, is strongly defended by its rocky coast, which only leaves open a small path.\n\nThe hostility which exists among the Balinese is shown by, among other things, the diversion of water; Mengui,\nfor instance, has dug a new bed on its territory for a river which formerly flowed into the sea in Badong, and by this means has left dry the rice-fields of Grobokkan on the borders of Badong.\n\n5. Karang-Assem. The reigning prince is Ngrurah\u00b9 G'de Karang-Assem. The family is that of Guja Madada, and the country was conquered by Mengui more than two hundred years ago. A list of the names of the princes of Karang-Assem is given in the Pamendanga, a work which we have mentioned above, but nothing is stated as to their acts. In the Usana Java, the governorship of Dawuh in Karang-Assem is held by Arya Manguri; it is not certain whether that family had the whole of Karang-Assem\u2014possibly part of it was in the possession of the Deva Agung. By the conquest of Karang-Assem by the house of Mengui, Klungkong was cut off from Buleleng, and the powerful royal family in the conquered state afterwards found it an easy matter to subdue Buleleng by itself.\n\nNo state has waged so many wars as Karang-Assem. We have spoken above of the victory over the Deva Agung and the destruction of Gelgel. The consequence of this was the subjugation of Buleleng and Lombok, and the family would perhaps have ended by making itself master of all Bali, Lombok, and Sembawa (Sembawa was actually attacked, but was spared through the intervention of the Dutch Government), but for its numerous civil wars. Many of the princes of Karang-Assem and of the conquered Buleleng were expelled by members of their own family. In Lombok, also, the two princes of the house of Karang-Assem were at war with each other nine years ago, with the result that the chief prince, that of Karang-Assem-Lombok, was defeated by the prince of Mataram, and committed suicide. Of the Karang-Assem-Lombok family two children were saved, a son and a\n\n\u00b9 Ngrurah means something that overshadows, palindongan, a pavong, and also the vault of heaven. The princes of the Wesyan race nearly all bear this title, they overshadow and protect the land. The prince of Mengui has not this title, for his country belongs to Klungkong, and is merely entrusted to the present prince as a fief of Klungkong. Ngrurah, Anggrurah, Anglarah, is in Java Lorah, a chief of the fourth rank.\ndaughter of the last prince, and they are now living in Karang-Assem-Bali.\\(^1\\) The rest of the family, including the women, murdered each other in true Indian fashion, in order not to survive the shame of defeat. They even wished to murder also a European who had sided with them, in order to go to heaven (Svarga) all together. This method \"of quitting life by the members of the family murdering each other,\" is also regarded in Bali as a Bela, and here also the Indian meaning of the word wela (\"sudden and easy death,\" see above) is applicable. Since the fall of Karang-Assem-Lombok, the princes of Karang-Assem-Bali, of Boleleng, and the Deva Agung, who is independent of them, have been enemies of Lombok, and do not acknowledge each other as lawful rulers. The prince of Lombok, which is also called Selaparang, is Ngrurah K'tut Karang-Assem.\n\nKarang-Assem is the most mountainous country of Bali, and grows little rice, but the dense population is very skilful in manual work, especially in wood-carving, whereby they gain their livelihood. According to the statements of the Balinese it contains 50,000 men able to bear arms.\n\n6. Boleleng. The prince is Ngruruh Made Karang-Assem. The family comes from Karang-Assem, and thus is originally descended from Mengui and Patih Gaja Madda. The present prince is a brother of the prince of Karang-Assem. Many dynasties have ruled in Boleleng. Seven generations ago the Xatriyan princes of Boleleng, relations of the Deva Agung, were expelled by a Wesayan family; to the latter belonged Ngrurah Panji, a descendant of Arya Beleteng. The surviving Xatriyas of Boleleng now live in Badong. Boleleng was finally conquered four or five generations ago by Karang-Assem, but this did not put a stop to the wars, for the members of the Karang-Assem family could not agree together. The most profound peace reigns now, since two brothers have filled the thrones of Karang-Assem and Boleleng. According to Balinese statements, Boleleng has but\n\n\\(^1\\) Perhaps these sole descendants have now been killed by the prince of Mataram-Lombok; at all events he was formerly in constant dread of these lawful heirs of Lombok.\n12,000 men capable of bearing arms; perhaps so few are returned in order to represent its conquest by the Government as of little importance.\n\nThe well-known *Gusti Jelanteg* is a cousin of the prince; his father was murdered by the late prince; yet the son now reigns, whilst the lawful king is but a shadow.\n\n7. Tabanan. Prince\u00b9 *Ratu Ngrurah Agung*. The family is that of *Arya Damar*, which is said to have remained pure, although here this is at any rate improbable, and in Badong is untrue. Tabanan does not engage in many wars; it has suffered defeat a few times from Boleleng, but has never been entirely conquered. In the war with Mengui, in which the whole of that state was conquered by Badong and its allies Gianyar and Tabanan, Tabanan received the mountain-district of Marga. The more recent quarrels with Mengui are of no importance and never result in anything. The men of Tabanan understand the art of war much less than the other Balinese. Two men of Tabanan are calculated to be no more than a match for one of Mengui, and the people of Badong add to this that one man of Badong is equal to two of Mengui.\u00b2 The men able to bear arms are stated to be 100,000 in number(?). Under the prince of Tabanan stands that of *Kediri*, a relation of the former, ruling over a tolerably large territory.\n\nAnother Punggawa of Tabanan is the prince of the Marga already mentioned; the latter is not a Wesya, but a Sudra. His ancestor was a seller of palm-wine (tuak), who managed to gain the favour of the prince of Mengui, and by him was made Punggawa. When the territory was transferred from Mengui to Tabanan, the prince of Marga retained his position. (His district grows most of the coffee in Bali.) This instance is the only one which has come to my knowledge of a Sudra prince, but it indicates the decay of the institution of caste. One often hears the nobles\n\n\u00b9 The title of *ratu* is always used in addressing princes, but it is only used before the name in speaking of especially distinguished princes. The raja of Tabanan has lately adopted it, and also *Sagung-Adi* in Pamchuttan.\n\n\u00b2 Recent experience during the third Dutch expedition does not confirm this assertion, Badong having, as is well known, been defeated.\nBali must go to the bad, now that the Sudras or children of Sudra mothers become kings. Compare Dera Lepung, etc., Pan'chuttan.\n\n1. Kedong. The three princes who together rule this State are: (1) Ngrurah G'de Pan'chuttan, (2) Made Ngrurah in Den Puyun, and (3) Ngrurah G'de (Kassiman). This State has been formed gradually. The western portion formerly belonged to Mengui and the eastern, the state of Pinatih, to the descendants of Arya Beleteng, who acknowledged the supremacy of Mengui. Pinatih lies to the eastward of Kassiman, from the frontier of Gianyar to Tanjang, opposite Serangan at the place where the roadstead is on the eastern side. It comprises Gunung Rata, Sanor, Taman Intaran, Sanga, and the island of Serangan, and is a very fertile district. The poorer western portion with Grobokkan, Legian Kereta Tuban, Jembaran, and the southern corner of Bali, the peak of the table-land called by the Balinese bukit, the mountain-range), were immediately under Mengui, to which state also belonged the P'kon Badong, a much-frequented place of trade. The founder of the state of Badong was a son of the royal house of Tabanan. In a manuscript which was lent to me, and in which a brief enumeration of the names and marriages of the princes of Badong was given at the end of another work, he was called Gusti Nyoman P'kon. He had settled in Tabanan in the campong of Kuta (Kuta and Jambe mean the betel-nut, pinang), and was therefore called Anak agung ring Buahan bumi Tabanan (as prince in or of Buahan in the land of Tabanan); he was the younger son, and sought for a place. From him to the Ga Kasuman, who now has the supreme government, there are ten generations, but until we come to the great-grandfather of this man, their history is little more than a list of names. He went from Tabanan to the P'kon Badong, and\n\n---\n\n*The date of a war with Sul\u00e9man (1682, corresponding with 1660 A.D.) is found in the manuscript of the Wriga Garga, which was lent to me; in that year the men of Kuning Assam (Sul\u00e9man) with their allies, Mengui, etc., had attacked and conquered Baleng, but had not conquered it. This is the only historical fact chronologically determined which came to my knowledge in Bali. It appears to have occurred in the time of Gusti Nyoman T'geh.*\nlived there in the house of Hi Sedahan, a Sudra (the name S'dah means sirih; this name renders the matter somewhat open to suspicion; was it necessary exactly that the pinang (bush) should come to the sirih?). He thus had no palace, nor does he seem to have had a governorship, nor a fixed residence in Badong, for his son or grandson again comes from Buahan to Badong. His sister married the Gusti Agung, the prince of Mengwi, but left no children. The reason of his departure is said to be that he went to seek a governorship in Mengwi, an object which his son or grandson seems for the first time to have attained.\n\n2. Anak Agung K'tut Mandean. This prince, the son or grandson of Ngrurah Bola, went from Buahan, in Tabanan, to the Gunung Batur, the mountain which vomits fire, on which Dewi Danu or Gangga is worshipped. This was evidently a pilgrimage; he did penance on the sacred mountain, in order to obtain earthly power. Thence he came to Badong and lived in the house of the M'kel (H'kel) Tinggi, to the south of the place of cremation of the present Pan\u00e9chutan, in the desa of T'gal. His surname, Mandean, is said to have been given him because he resided at first in the house of a mandesa (it is possible that he himself was nothing more than a mandesa, a campong-chief). With the aid of the M'kel Tinggi he soon managed to gain a large number of followers, the result of his penances, and became a Punggawa of Mengwi.\n\n3. Anak Agung Peledekun, son of the last mentioned; he also appears to have been a Punggawa.\n\n4. The three sons of the last are Gusti Wayahan T'geh, Gusti Nyoman T'yeh and Gusti K'tut K'di. The second, Gusti Nyoman T'yeh, is the ancestor of the succeeding princes, and increased the power of the house. He married a woman of noble family (prami), of Buahan. He was brave and cunning, and had a body of picked troops. One of his wife's sisters was married at Khlongkong to the Dalem (Deva Agung), and died as a Satia; and the other married in Mengwi the Gusti Agung, and became the ancestress of all the Gusti Agungs (princes) of Mengwi. These noble alliances\nand his personal qualities added to his influence, and he seems to have possessed the whole of ancient Badong from Amin-Gindai to Glogor, Pam'chuttan, and Kassiman. It is not certain when the wars with Mengui began, but probably he and his son, and grandson after him, were Punggawas of Pam'chuttan.\n\nA Giusti Ngrurah Jambe Mihik (he is named Jambe, because his mother was from Buahan or Jambe, in Tabanan).\n\n6. The two sons of the last mentioned, by one mother, are Anak Agung G'de Galogor and Anak Agung T'las ring batu Krotok. Their mother was from Panataran, a place in the present Pam'chuttan; the Aryas Panataran were at that time still Wesyas, but afterwards they were degraded to Sudras. His wife was also from Panataran, and he seems to have founded Pam'chuttan, or to have made it his residence. Pam'chuttan is derived from p'chut, an ox-whip; the descent of the race of Pam'chuttan from an ox-driver is found in Abdullah (Tijdschrift, 7, 2, p. 166 sqq.). It is admitted in Badong that the wife of one of the ancestors was of humble origin, the daughter of an ox-driver, but it does not appear that the wife of Anak Agung T'las ring batu Krotok was of such low birth; had she been so, her son Ngrurah Sakti Pam'chuttan would not have attained such great distinction and power.\n\nAt this time there were princes' capitals in T'gal; this is the most ancient, and was founded by the second prince. T'gal lies to the south of Pam'chuttan\u2014the principal family, of course, resided here; thence was descended the family in P'ken Badong, which had palaces both here and in Xatriya, north of Den Passar. Galogor, to the north of Pam'chuttan, was also a capital, founded by the elder brother of Anak Agung T'las ring batu Krotok; the family still exists, and has probably been spared on account of its near relationship with the line of Pam'chuttan. The descendants became Punggawas of Pam'chuttan, and afterwards of Den Passar.\n\nPam'chuttan, finally, the capital of Anak Agung T'las ring\nbatu Krotok, was at that time the seat of the younger line, which, however, was soon to unite the whole of Badong.\n\n7. The sons of Anak Agung T'las ring batu Krotok are called putras, princes. They are: (a) Anak Agung ring Pam'chuttan, also called Nguruh Sakti Pam'chuttan, (b) Gusti Made T'gal, (c) Gusti K'tut T'labah. Of the last two nothing is known. The first is he who founded the power of Pam'chuttan. He had obtained that great power by means of a creese pusaka, called singha\u2014thence his name Sakti (supernatural power). He subjugated the most ancient capital of the princes of Badong in T'gal, and waged successful wars against Mengui, from which he wrested the territory from the present frontier of Mengui to the point of the table-land. He appears to have been the first who was regarded in Badong as an independent prince. He had five hundred wives; the principal ones (pramii) were from Tungkeban (Bangli, thus an intermixture with Xatriyas), Galogor, and Mengui. From this prince are descended eight hundred Gusti Pam'chuttan, who, on account of their near relationship, are regarded as the support and strength of the land. But where brother is ready to fight against brother, such a strength is imaginary. These eight hundred Gustis have a common sanctuary in Pam'chuttan, where they must appear once a month, and in case of absence have to pay a penalty.\n\nBesides Pam'chuttan, the kingdom of the Jambes also existed at that time in P'ken Badong and Xatriya (the last being merely a country residence of the prince). They also gained distinction by subduing the kingdom of Pinath, the eastern portion of Badong. They were still of importance at that period, and really of nobler birth than the princes of Pam'chuttan. Galogor had transferred itself to Pam'chuttan as Punggawa.\n\nNguruh Sakti's principal sons were:\n\n8. (a.) Nguruh G'de Pam'chuttan, devata di Ukiran (who died in Ukiran); from him are descended the present princes of Pam'chuttan, of whom we shall speak hereafter. (b.)\nNgrurah Mayun, in the palace of Mayun\\(^1\\) on the opposite side of the river to the east of Kassiman. This palace no longer exists; all the materials of which it was built have been taken to Den Passar. (c.) Ngrurah Kaleran, in the palace of Kaleran; to the north of Pam'chuttan, which position is also indicated by the name kaleran (northern). Little is recorded of these princes; of course they, too, had wars with Mengui and other states, but they have done no prominent acts, and are overshadowed by the fame of their father and their descendants. Pam'chuttan remained and still remains the chief seat of the family; the prince of Pam'chuttan alone can obtain the Abis'eka, that is, can be anointed as prince of the whole realm.\n\n9. The most remarkable of the descendants of the three sons of Ngrurah Sakti was Ngrurah Made Pam'chuttan, the son of Ngrurah Kaleran. This chief married the daughter of Ngrurah Mayun, thereby uniting two portions of the possessions of the Pam'chuttan family, and founded the palace of Kassiman. Not content with this, he attacked the Jambes in P'ken Badong and Xatriya, and conquered their territory after a severe struggle. He was supported by Pam'chuttan and Gianyar, whilst the Jambes received aid from Mengui. Great must have been the slaughter in the palace of P'ken Badong\u2014it is spoken of with terror to this day. The fate is also lamented of the murdered Raja Jambe, who, the people say, was entirely blameless, and had given no cause for the war. He had his revenge, however, upon his conqueror, according to the belief of the Balinese, for he was born again in the family of his foe, as his grandson, and the one of noblest birth, a circumstance which was an omen of great misfortune to that family. The conqueror began to build the great palace of Den Passar, but died before it was half finished; he had already taken up his residence, however, in the new palace, and in him began the line of the princes of Den Passar: the palace in Kassiman was still inhabited after-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Mayun is the same as Made, \"the middle or second son (or daughter).\" This name now no longer exists in Badong; the second prince in the family of Pam'chuttan is called Made.\nwards by his wife from Mayun, and was finally given up to his second son (according to birth), the still living Raja Kassiman. This prince, for the sake of distinction, is called devata di made, \"died in the middle\" (made\u2014the middle\u2014is here Den Passar, which, both from the rank of its prince and from its situation, comes between Pam'chuttan and Kassiman). His numerous quarrels with Mengwi and nearly all Bali have been without result. Even Tabanan has once fought against him, at the desire of the Deva Agung, and, to save appearances, burnt a single campong; in reality, however, Tabanan and Gianyar have always remained friendly to Badung, but they were obliged for political reasons to assume the appearance of hostility against their ally. Badung has neither gained nor lost territory under his rule, while it has become an independent state. The quarrels with the other states were caused chiefly by the aggressions of the Jambes.\n\n10. The sons of this prince, besides many of lower birth, were: (a) Ngrurah Made Pam'chuttan in Den Passar, (b) Ngrurah Kassiman in Kassiman, (c) Ngrurah Jambe, who lives near Den Passar. All three are by different mothers; the first is by a mother from Pam'chuttan, daughter of the Devata di Ubud (Nyr. G'de Pam'chuttan), and a princess of Tabanan. This prince was younger than the prince of Kassiman, but as he was born of a Raja-woman he took the highest rank among the sons. Kassiman, the old prince who still lives, is the son of a Gusti-woman of Pam'chuttan. Ngrurah Jambe is the son of the daughter of the last prince of Xatriya, who was forced to marry the conqueror and murderer of her father. By birth he would be more noble than Kassiman, and equal to Pam'chuttan, but the descendants of a conquered prince can never again acquire rank in Bali. His noble birth is acknowledged, but he can make no claim to the throne.\n\nThe prince of Den Passar, called after his death devata di\n\nDen Passar means north of the Passar, or, still better, on the further side of the Passar, thus we have also Den Bahu, \"on the further side of the mountains,\" as another name for Bedeleng.\nXatriya, was an ally of Gianyar and Tabanan. These three began a fresh war against Mengui, which was carried on more by artifice than by force of arms; the Punggawa of Marga, for instance, who at that time was subject to Mengui, being induced to surrender to Tabanan. For fear that he would lose all his territory in this way, the prince of Mengui gave his land in fief to the prince of Den Passar, and remained in possession of Mengui as Punggawa of Badong; he only lost Marga to Tabanan, and Kadewatan, a small piece of territory on the frontier, to Gianyar. After this arrangement, the four southern states were allied together against Karang-Assem and Boleleng, the old enemies of Badong and Tabanan, whilst Klongkong remained neutral. This state of affairs continued until shortly after the death of the prince of Den Passar, which took place in 1829.\n\nThe prince of Den Passar continued the building of the palace at that place, but did not finish it; we see it now in the state in which he left it. Most of the building materials had to be found by the conquered state of Mengui, where timber was obtained from the mountains, this article being very scarce in Badong. He had several noble wives, but his only son of noble birth, Ngrurah G\u2019de Putra, died a short time before his father. This was the one already mentioned, who was considered to be the last r\u00e2ja Jambe born again, which belief his own father shared. He was regarded as certain to bring misfortune upon the family, and it would seem that he did not die a natural death. In the compact with Mengui, the prince of that land had declared himself a vassal of Ngrurah Made Pam\u2019chuttan and his son Ngrurah G\u2019de Putra. The death of both without a previous renewal of the compact, enabled Mengui to regard itself as discharged from its obligations towards Badong, and it soon, in fact, withdrew from them.\n\nAfter the death of Ngrurah Made Pam\u2019chuttan, Kassiman was the only prince of importance of the family of Den Passar, and he thus gained the supremacy in Den Passar and Kassiman. During his brother\u2019s lifetime these two nearly came to blows; Kassiman had already placed his\ncountry in a state of defence, but this civil war was prevented by the intervention of Ngrurah G'de Pam'chuttan, the then prince of Pam'chuttan.\n\nThe eldest surviving son of Ngrurah Made Pam'chuttan was Ngrurah G'de Oka. He would have become prince of Den Passar, but he would not acknowledge the supremacy of Kassiman. Kassiman, in conjunction with the prince of Pam'chuttan, compelled him, however, to leave the country, and banished him to Tabanan. This did not prevent him from acting against Kassiman. From Tabanan he went to Mengui, and, both here and in Bangli, gained friends who were willing to support him. To strengthen his party still further, he released Mengui from its vassalage to Badong, under the pretext of being his father's heir, and gave it to the Deva Agung. The latter hastened to make use of this gift, and was able to do so without scruple, because the prince of Mengui had only sworn allegiance in the contract with Badong to the deceased princes Ngrurah Made Pam'chuttan and his son Ngrurah G'de Putra. The Deva Agung then commanded that Ngrurah G'de Oka should be received again in Badong, and this command was obeyed, for this prince had made his appearance with a numerous army from Mengui and Bangli. Ngrurah G'de Oka afterwards carried off Kassiman's only daughter, and took her to wife. Old Kassiman again made use of this to confirm his power over Den Passar; he was now in fact the prince's father. Not long after this marriage, however, Ngrurah G'de Oka died also. The sudden death of this prince, his brother, and his father leads us to suspect unnatural means, but I cannot assert, nor would I willingly believe, that they were applied by Kassiman. This old man, it is true, took the best advantage of circumstances, not only in Den Passar, but also in Pam'chuttan, of which we are about to speak. The present prince of Den Passar is Ngrurah Made, who, against his will, acknowledges old prince Kassiman as supreme prince in Badong, but, nevertheless, is independent and endeavouring to increase his power.\n\nPam'chuttan, since the time of Ngrurah Sakti, has been\nThe family of Den Passar, however, was in wars, acquired greater fame, and the prince and brother has, in fact, held the highest authority notwithstanding the nominally higher position of Pam'chuttan. We have seen above, that Ngrurah Sakti Pam'chuttan took up the name of Pam'chuttan. His name was (8) Ngrurah Sakti Pam'chuttan di Ukiran (Ukiran is a place in Den Passar). He was succeeded by his son (9) Ngrurah G'de Pam'chuttan di Munchuk; both were always more famous relations in Den Passar, and their supremacy was maintained by marriages. The last noble birth was (10) Ngrurah G'de Pam'chuttan di Agung: he was anointed,\u00b9 and played an important role in the wars of Kassiman's father and brother. By comparison, his prince and Kassiman's brother, his cousin Anak Agung Lanang crossed the sea with an army to Jembrana, conquered this country, which belonged to Buleleng. Anak Agung Lanang went thither because the prince of Den Passar wished to banish him from Badong. This fact shows the supremacy of Den Passar at that time. Jembrana was soon lost again, however, and subsequently Anak Agung Lanang (about 1830), after the death of Ngrurah G'de Pam'chuttan, who left no sons, became prince of Pam'chuttan. He was not anointed, but yet enjoyed greater renown than his son, the present prince. He had no sons of noble birth; he only had by a Gundik (concubine) the two sons now called (12) Ngrurah G'de Pam'chuttan and Ngrurah Made Pam'chuttan. These, during their father's lifetime, were his Parakans, who carried after him his sirih-box, etc. After the death of Anak Agung Lanang, a great portion of the Punggawas of Pam'chuttan would not acknowledge his son as prince, on account of his low birth. Kassiman, however, who in the mean time had also ob-\n\n\u00b9 The anointing of a prince, abis'eka (Sans.), is performed by the priests (the Guru lokes). In Badong it only takes place at Pam'chuttan. In order to be anointed, the prince must be both of noble birth and instructed in all religious duties. The prince of Pam'chuttan referred to in the text was a Resi; he had attained the position of a saint by penances (maveda).\ntained the supreme power in Den Passar, supported the new prince. Some Punggawas (e.g., Deva Made Rahi, in Kutta) submitted, and a Gusti of Legian fled the country and took refuge in Gianyar. Kassiman then established the new prince in the ancestral palace of Pam'chuttan, and his authority, by marrying him to the daughters of Ngrurah G'de Pam'chuttan, the cousin and predecessor of his father. These women are the principal surviving members of the family, and their illustrious birth enhances that of the prince, who is himself, as it were, his wife's inferior. His principal wife's name is Sagung Adi, another is called Sagung Mule, and a third Sagung Oka. Sagung Adi has now assumed the name of Ratu, which we have also seen was done by the prince of Tabanan.\n\nKassiman's intervention in the affairs of Pam'chuttan gave him the supreme authority in this part of Badong also. He is regarded as the father of the princes of Den Passar and Pam'chuttan, and uses circumstances very cleverly to keep those princes in dependence.\n\nThe prince of Den Passar, Made Ngrurah, and his brothers K'tut Ngrurah and Ngrurah K'tut, were all born of mothers of low extraction, and had they a brother of higher birth, would not have the least claim to rule. Besides this, K'tut Ngrurah is in opposition to Made Ngrurah, and asserts that he has a better claim than the latter. He has several of the Punggawas on his side, and Made Ngrurah is therefore obliged to invoke the aid of his uncle Kassiman to maintain his position. Kassiman, however, it would seem, does not trust Made Ngrurah, who has inherited much of his father's ambitious character; he, therefore, does all he can to uphold the power of Pam'chuttan, and has enriched the prince of that country and invested him with a certain renown. The prince of Pam'chuttan, therefore, dares not dispute Kassiman's authority; he is of low birth and a peaceful disposition, and\n\n---\n\n1 Sagung means a princess, born of a princely father and mother Sagun, one whose mother was only a Gusti-woman. Saguna is derived from sagung, great; Saguna from sana, good, which we have also found to be a name for the female Brahman. (Idem).\nwould also have to fear the house of Den Passar, which considers itself raised above so low a birth by the deeds of its father and grandfather. The prince of Pam'chuttan has not the abis'eka; although he is a man of about forty-five, he is not yet sufficiently instructed in his duties and in religion; he has performed his duties to the Pitaras, having, with all due ceremony, burnt his father, and built a new domestic temple, which was finished a year ago; yet it appears that he will not receive the abis'eka during Kassiman's lifetime, and, in the event of his death, this would also, perhaps, be prevented by the opposition of Den Passar. The prince of Den Passar has not fulfilled his duties towards his ancestors; his father and brother as well as other chief members of his family are still unburnt, and are preserved in the palace of Den Passar. On this account Made Ngrurah does not reside in the palace.\n\nThis cremation must from the rank of the deceased be very splendid; the prince of Den Passar, however, has not the means to do it, and, although apparently, the whole population of Badong works for him, this produces very little visible result. He has to complete the palace which his father left unfinished, and in which much work has still to be done, and further to improve the roads of his country, which have fallen into a very bad state of repair since the death of his father, the last prince of Pam'chuttan who had the abis'eka. And, finally, he cannot easily raise the funds for a great cremation, and is opposed in his undertakings by K'tut Ngrurah, and, in secret, by Kassiman. In Den Passar also, therefore, it is probable that the position of affairs will remain unchanged till Kassiman's death. Yet another reason against the cremation of the late prince of Den Passar and his son G'de Putra appears to be the above-mentioned superstition, that prince Jambe has been born again in the family of Den Passar in the person of G'de Putra. This second birth indicates misfortune for the family, which fears either that that prince will be born a third time, or that the curse which seems to attach to the family prevents it from performing works pleasing to the gods.\n**Genealogical Table of the Princes of Badong.**\n\n1. **Gusti Ngururah Bola.**\n2. **Anak Agung K'tut Mandesa.**\n3. **Anak Agung Pad\u00e8d\u00e8kan.**\n\n| Gusti Wayahan T\u00e9g\u00e9h. | (4) Gusti Nyoman T\u00e9g\u00e9h. called Anak Agung di Pule. | Gusti K'tut K'di. |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n|                      | (5) Gusti Ngururah Jambe Mihik.                  |                 |\n\n| Anak Agung G'de Galogor. | (6) Anak Agung t'las ring batu Krotok, in Pam'chuttan |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n\nThe princely family of Galogor.\n\n| (7) Anak Agung ring Pam'chuttan, called Ngururah Sakti Pam chuttan, with 500 wives. | Gusti Made T'gal | Gusti K'tut T'laba. |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------|\n\n(8) **Ngr.

Alit Raka.\n\nAll these are by mothers of low caste; the family of Belaluan has again raised itself in rank by means of noble marriages. The others, after one more intermixture with Sudran blood, will sink into the position of ordinary Gostis.\n\nFurther Remarks on the Castes.\n\nThe Dewas, Gostis, and Idas are much too numerous in Bali to maintain their dignity; they, and especially the first two classes, are too proud to gain their livelihood by work,\nand prefer unjust privileges. They rob the people without limit; they are the cause of the plundering of ships, and of the extortions to which foreign traders are often exposed. The high-caste princes are seldom guilty of such misdeeds, but they wink at the robberies of their relations, and it is difficult to obtain justice from the princes against these pests of the land. The Gustis in the countries ruled by Wesya princes, and the Devas in those where Xatriyas reign, have properly all the official posts about the prince, but although they derive much honour from these, they get little pay.\n\nFeudal System.\n\nAs Raffles has observed, the condition of Bali very much resembles that of Europe in the middle ages; there is a feudal system throughout the land. The Dera Agung must be regarded as the supreme feudal lord; in ancient times he was so in reality (see Usana Java, above). How this is modified now, we have already seen. He still calls the other seven princes, and also the prince of Lombok, his Punggawas, which in Bali conveys the idea of vassal. The rest of the princes (Xatriyas and Wesyas) have subdivided their land among the members of their families, and so we find in Badong the princes of Kaleran Kowon, Kaleran Kanginan, Ngurah Tyas, the prince of Galagor, and Kassiman's brother with their children as Punggawas of Den Passar (formerly most of them were under Pam'chuttan, but they have preferred to acknowledge as their lords the two warlike princes of Den Passar, Kassiman's father and brother; unless Kassiman had interfered, even the sovereignty over Badong itself would have been transferred from Pam'chuttan to Den Passar). Now they are all under Kassiman, but only in so far as Den Passar also is under his sovereignty. The real Punggawas of Kassiman, in his small original territory, are few in number, and, for the most part, merely the descendants of his brothers, who were entirely without means.\n\n1 Punggawas, \"bull\" and \"excellent\" in the Sanskrit.\nUnder these princes, who are Punggawas of the highest princes and mostly closely related to the royal families, stand the rest of the Gustis, also as Punggawas; these also have an undefined authority over the men whom they rule, and have even the power to punish with death; the prince above them and the prince of the whole kingdom do not trouble themselves about their subjects further than their feudal duties are concerned. The Diaksa\\(^2\\) have merely to pronounce judgment between the Sudras and sometimes between Gustis of equal rank; in all cases concerning the distinctions of caste and feudal duties the princes and Punggawas are judges; in spiritual matters, however, the Padandas act in this capacity.\n\nThe primary feudal duty, as in the middle ages, is service in war; and further, the Punggawas and their subordinates have to furnish assistance in all public works and festivals of the prince, and the lower orders also have to carry out all the works of the Punggawas. The people, under the guidance of the Punggawas, have to build the princes\u2019 palaces and places of cremation, to repair the roads, and besides this to contribute, mostly in kind, towards the expenses of all offerings, family feasts, and cremations. The direct taxes are very unimportant; the common man pays a small tax on garden land, and a little more on sawahs. The princes, therefore, cannot be rich, unless they possess considerable private means; they are powerful, however, so long as their names hold the Punggawas in subjection, and they can therefore celebrate their splendid feasts and cremations without cost to themselves, and sometimes even with advantage to their private treasuries, their faithful vassals zealously contributing to these ceremonies. (One of the reasons why the great cremation in Den Passar does not take place is, that the\n\n---\n\n1 We do not find many exceptions to this rule; in Tabanan the prince is descended from Marga; in Klongkong, e.g. Nguruh Pinatih, from Arya Bleteng. In Gianyar Sukawati.\n\n2 I write Diaksa instead of Yaka (as the judges are usually called in Bali and Java), on the authority of a manuscript, where the writing with the second d reveals the origin of the word. Diaksa, which is also found as Adiaksa in the MSS., is Skt.\u2014adhi and ak\u1e63a, an inspector, protector (see Wilson). Yaka, on the contrary, is a sort of demon, allied to the R\u0101ksasa.\npresent prince is not in very high esteem with the Punggawas, and that not enough is contributed towards it. Besides this, Kassiman retains the revenue.) To the revenues of the princes and the Punggawas belong also the duties on commerce, the customs-duties, and the bridge or road-tolls. Trade especially produces a considerable revenue for the prince, and has made the princes of Badong comparatively rich, above all Pamchutan and Kassiman. Karang-Assem also makes a great deal by it. These imposts affect only the lower orders, and the Chinese, Buginese, and Europeans. The Gustis, Devas, and Idas who carry on trade pay no duty upon it. The feudal lords, princes, and Punggawas still do something for the people\u2014they give them water, and the making of canals and the effective irrigation of the rice-fields is their duty; in return for this, however, they draw a small revenue from the rice-growers.\n\nSudras.\n\nThe fourth caste, the Sudras, have many duties and hardly any rights, at any rate as regards the higher castes. Their subjection goes so far that the prince or Punggawa can take out of their houses whatever he likes; when the prince goes from one place to another, the victuals, fowls, ducks, geese, etc., are usually taken by the Parakans (followers of the prince) from the houses of the Sudras in the desus through which the route lies, and the persons thus robbed may not even complain. The prince or Punggawa can even take away the wives of a Sudra, but religious feeling is opposed to this, and still more to the murder of a Sudra, who has committed no fault, by a noble. Both acts are done, however, although they are of rare occurrence, in Badong. The wanton young Gustis and Devas think that they prove their valour and noble birth by the abduction of women and the murder of innocent beasts of burden, such as the Sudras are.\n\nI am only acquainted, however, with two bridges in Bali excepting these over small streams in any way worthy of the name\u2014one at Kertha, built by Europeans with European aid, and one, very dangerous for want of planks, over a rocky stream in Tabanan.\nIn Badong, old Kassiman suppressed such deeds, and the fear of punishment after death also has a deterrent effect.\\(^1\\) Nevertheless the position of the Sudras is most miserable, and only rendered supportable by their courage and industry, and by the belief that they are born to it. An exception to the rest of the Sudras is formed by the Parakans (the followers of the princes, etc.); these lead as idle a life as the princes and Punggawas to whom they belong, and plunder the rest of the people. These and the nobles are the chief cock-fighters and opium-smokers, for the inhabitants of the dessas take little part in these dissipations. Another exception to the lot of the ordinary Sudras is formed by the Mandesas, Prab\u2019k\u00eals, and others, who occupy official posts.\n\nMandesas are the dessa-chiefs; they have been degraded to Sudras by the Deva Agung, having been Wesyas by birth. Under them are the Kabayan, Nguhukin, and Talikup, Sudras by birth, who carry out the orders of the Mandesas.\n\nGadoeh are the Mandurs in the dessas; they are Sudras by birth. Dangka and Batu-Aji are under these.\n\nPasek are also Wesyas who have been degraded to Sudras, and still retain a certain superiority of rank above the rest of the populace.\n\nWe find all these names in the Usana Bali (see p. 262), where their special religion is mentioned (the Usana Bali, as we have seen, is only of importance to the Sudras and their chiefs of the same caste).\n\nThe names are not heard in ordinary life, with the exception of Mandesa. For all the rest the collective name Prab\u2019k\u00eal (the collective B\u2019k\u00eals) is used. These have a certain number of common Sudras under them at the prince\u2019s disposal, to serve in war or on public works, and also to exercise handicrafts (as smiths, etc.). They are responsible for the presence and the work of their subordinates, just as the Mandesa is responsible for his dessa. Prab\u2019k\u00eal or Pam\u2019k\u00eal,\n\n\\(^1\\) Balinese superstition regards the fate of the first Deva Mangis, the founder of Gianyar, and that of the wife of the last Deva Agung, the much-feared princess of Karang Assem, as examples of such punishments; the former was changed into a serpent (ndga), and the latter into a frog (dongkang). Both had murdered many victims.\nalso M'kel, has become a title for every superior among the Sudras\u2014the owner is the M'kel of the slave, the husband the M'kel of the wife. This exalted rank is also accorded to Europeans, but they stand below the three principal castes; they have not been born twice (drija).\n\nThe Balinese Sudras are partly of Javan and partly of Balinese origin. The former celebrate the new year (Sugian) six days before the Balinese new year (Galungan). The latter, however, is taken as the beginning of the calendar by the whole people.\n\nIn addition to the above, degraded Brahmans, Xatriyas, and Wesyas also belong to the Sudras. The original Wesyas, those who came from Majapahit, have all become Sudras, and this at the same time that the descendants of Arya Damar were degraded to Wesyas. The reason given for this does not agree with that of the degradation of the Xatriyas. All castes, namely, are said to have descended a step, excepting the original Brahmans. The descendants of Batu Henggong, the Deva Agungs, who, on account of their procreation by the Padanda Dung hyang Kupakisan, were also regarded as Brahmans, sank luck, through the curse or the anger of the Padanda who produced the Naga from the well (see as to the NagaPadanda, under Cremations), to true Xatriyas, and the consequence of this was the degradation of the other Xatriyas to Wesyas, and of the Wesyas to Sudras. This explanation is open to great doubt. Most of the descendants of the Aryas, the brothers of Arya Damar, have been degraded to Sudras. They were degraded, as we have seen, to Wesyas, but when they had also lost their governorships and their authority, oppressed by the descendants of Patih Gaja Maja (the royal race of Mengwi-Karang-Assem), they gradually sank to the rank of Sudras. Many of them are still called Gusitis by the people, but they have to give their services as vassals to the princes in whose territory they live, and no longer enjoy any honour. The conquered are always despised and degraded in Bali. Brahmans are also degraded to Sudras, if, on account of frequent intermixture with Sudra\n\n1 Anth. Vol. IX. p. 90.\nblood, they are no longer considered capable of retaining their dignity. An instance of a Padanda being thus degraded is actually mentioned. Brahmans do, indeed, become Sudras, but the people hold the caste in such great respect, that they are still regarded and honoured as Brahmans. Brahmana chute are mentioned in the Usana Java; the Balinese explain these to be lying and thieving Brahmans, who, on account of their conduct, have sunk to the rank of Sudras. Chute is, indeed, in Sanskrit, chyuta, \"fallen.\"\n\nSangguhu is a subdivision of the Sudras, who are acquainted with the Vedas, and perform the ceremony of domestic worship, as well as the priests. If they have, indeed, the Vedas (they may be only Mantras, formulas), it would seem that they were originally Brahmans. Now we find in the Usana Java a statement that the Sangguhus are, in fact, descended from Brahmana-Brahmani, and thus are pure Brahmans, and that they were degraded on account of the worship of the Dalem mur, that is, the god of death (perhaps as indicating an exclusive K\u0101la-worship, which no longer exists in Bali). We have therefore had in Bali departures from the worship of the gods, not to say sects. The present Brahmans, who have suppressed the sect referred to, now tell us, to conceal the existence of any other worship but their own, that the Sangguhus are descended from a parakan (follower) of a learned Padanda, who was hidden under the Bale whenever the Padanda performed his domestic worship, and so came to understand the Vedas. When he was discovered, the Padanda set him at liberty, that he might perform the Veda-worship for himself and his descendants. From him are descended the Sangguh or Sangguhu, which word is explained by means of kira: having the appearance of being Brahmans. There is some number of them in Bali.\n\nByagaha are also mentioned in the Usana Java as a distinct class, and these appear to be of the same rank as the Sangguhu. The name, however, is almost unknown, even to the Panditas. Thus in the three classes of Sudras last mentioned, we find also no mixture of caste; but they all three point to\nthe former existence of sects, or at least to some departures from the orthodox religion.\n\nIt would be a fortunate thing for the Sudras to be freed from the oppression of the princes and Punggawas. The number of noble idlers increases every day, and presses more and more heavily upon the poor Sudra populace. One means of escaping from the oppression of a prince is to flee to another state, but even this avails them little, for the prince of the state in which the fugitive seeks refuge immediately imposes upon him the very burdens from which he has fled. Besides this, a fugitive who arrives without his family is sold by the prince, in order to make some profit out of him, and to prevent his escaping again to another country. The best asylum is generally afforded by the Padandas; the prince has no right to fugitives who seek refuge with them, and there are several kind-hearted really pious men among these Padandas, who consider it shameful to sell a person seeking an asylum, or even to require much work from him. Many Padandas, however, are also genuine natives, and avail themselves of these cases to enrich themselves. The chief curb upon the despotism of the noble castes over the Sudras is, in fact, the fear lest they should run away, and the power and revenues of the nobles should thereby be diminished. The Balinese, however, are unusually attached to their country and their dusa; ordinary extortion does not drive them to flight; it is generally only some glaring cruelty or the fear of being sold out of Bali that induces them to escape. Still, the fact that there are always many fugitives in Bali shows the injustice and cruelty of most of the princes, and the degeneration of the system of caste. In Badong there are very many fugitives from Gianyar, Mengui, Klengkong, and Karang-Assem; on the other hand, scarcely any fugitives from Badong are to be found in the other states. The reason of this is, that the government in this state is comparatively mild and humane, and this is attributable to Kusiman's higher intelligence and his contact with Europeans. For the sake of humanity it is desirable that intercourse between Europeans and the Balinese should increase,\nand that the position of the Sudras should thus be improved, at any rate a little, if they could not be entirely freed from their oppressors. The character of the Balinese as a people, irrespectively of their castes, has been very accurately perceived by Raffles: *they are a manly nation*, both in body and mind, far superior to the Javanese (although outwardly less civilized), and endowed with many virtues which in Java have disappeared beneath the mire of immorality and fickleness. The Balinese (excepting those who carry on trade and are corrupted by undue gains) are *faithful* and *honest* and *can work hard*; it is only for their prince that they work reluctantly, for they receive from him neither payment nor food; and, finally, they are *braver* than all other natives, but against the European they are as incapable of resistance as all the descendants of the black Adam, and the defiant language employed to Europeans comes from a timid heart. The European is as a tiger to all natives, and they know him by instinct.\n\n**Caste in Java.**\n\nThe existence of caste in Java has hitherto been denied, but what we now know of Bali appears to have placed it beyond doubt. That all the institutions of the Balinese are of Javan origin is affirmed by the manuscripts and the oral tradition of the people. The Usana Java enumerates *Xatriyas* of Koripan (where Panji lived), of Gaglang or Singhasari, of Kediri or Daha, and of Janggala. In all the great kingdoms of Java, therefore, Xatriyas existed. The descent of the Xatriyas of Daha is traced in the Brahmanda-purana to the Muni Pulaha. In the same work the Brahmans are divided into Siva-Brahmans, Buddha-Brahmans, and Bujangga-Brahmans (thus the Brahmans in Java were exactly like those now in Bali); these are sons of Brahmana Haji, that is to say, the various forms of worship are derived from Haji Saka, the founder of the Indo-Javanese calendar. Bujangga seems in ancient times to have been a distinct sect. We have spoken of the present meaning of this word; it seems\nCASTE IN JAVA.\n\nformerly to have meant a particular kind of worship, in contradistinction to Siva and Buddha. The Wesyas are also mentioned in the Usana Java as existing in Java; to these belong the Patike, D'manga, and Tumenggungs. The names Wesya and Gusti (see Tijdsch. v. N. I. 7, 2, 185) still exist in Java, although their meaning has become obscure. The Sudras are expressly mentioned, and their name also is still heard in Java.\n\nIn the Usana Java (which really only relates to Java) the Brahmins spring from Brahma's Simadara, the opening in the head which in children does not close for some years, the Xatriyas from his breast, the Wesyas from his abdomen, and the Sadras from his knee.\n\nThe nobles of the courts of Daha and Majapahit, according to express testimony, were Xatriyas and Wesyas. To the Xatriyas belong all those who bear the title of Arya, K'bo, or Mahesa and Rangga. The titles of the Wesyas have just been given.\n\nThe appearance of caste and the existence of the Vedas in Bali afford the strongest evidence for the existence of both in ancient Java, because all that we find in Bali was derived from Java alone, not a single fact discovered in Bali proving, or even indicating, direct communication between this island and India, and because the Siva Brahmins, who, after having established themselves for a short time at Majapahit, crossed over to Bali, came, according to the Balinese, not direct from India, but from the interior of Java (Kediri). The real origin of all the Balinese institutions is also shown by the fact that we find nothing to remind us directly of India, and no ancient writing, Sanskrit, Kawi, or Javanese: we may well ask how could emigrants from India have so neglected and forgotten their own writing and language, and have merely preserved the modern Javanese writing and the Kawi tongue?\n\nThe word Bunyaga means a serpent; in India the serpent-worship has been adopted in the Brahmanical doctrine, we find it especially in Cusmara, serpent-worship is still found in Java and Bali (Yasuki), and the Bunyagas appear to have originally been serpent-worshippers, who afterwards joined the Sivalic sect.\nThe Calculation of Time in Bali.\n\nThe calculation of time is of two kinds: the Indian and the Balinese. All that we know of it is contained in a work called *Wriga Garga*.\u00b9 This work is composed of Indian and Polynesian elements, and, like the rest of the literature, must be of Javanese origin, as in that island alone do we find an almost identical calendar.\n\nWe have an Indian division of time, according to the lunar months. These months, however, are transformed by interpolation, into the solar year, and the solar years are calculated from the time of *Salivahana* or *Saka*, as is also the practice in the greater part of Hindustan and of the Dekkan. This calendar begins on the 14th of March, 78 B.C. This calculation, however, is but little used by the Balinese, and their scanty astronomical knowledge renders it extremely difficult, although, for the sake of agriculture and a few feasts, it must be preserved. The interpolation is irregular; in India two months are introduced in five years, but in Bali, on the one hand, the month of *Kartika* may comprise two months, and, on the other, the month of *Asada* may last till the constellation of the Pleiades (*Kr\u00ebttika*) is visible at sunset. The only constellations used by the Balinese in such calculations are the Pleiades and Orion. The latter is called *Waluku*, the plough, and also by the Indian name *l\u00e4nggala* (in Malay *tengala*). They understand by this, however, only the three centre stars of Orion. To supplement this defective means of calculating the year, the Balinese observe certain natural phenomena occurring regularly every year at the same time, such as the blossoming of certain flowers and plants and the appearance of wings on the white ant, and also the phenomena of the sea. A man of rank informed me that the interpolation of a month had only happened three times in his life. This would give an interval of about twelve years.\n\n\u00b9 *Garga*, according to Wilson, is one of the ten Munis or saints; one Garga is author of astronomical works in India; see Bentley, \"Hindu Astronomy,\" its book is named *Sanhita*; he lived 550 years B.C. The Balinese it is, however, cannot be derived from him, because it contains not known in India.\nbetween each interpolation; it is more probable that an interpolation is made every ten years, hence the name tenggek for such a division. At present the Balinese lunar months are rather more than thirty days in advance of the Indian, as fixed by Wilson. The year begins with the month of Kasanga; the Indian name for this is Chetra, and commences, according to Wilson, in March. This, then, proves that the Balinese years do indeed start from the exact date of Saka (14th of March), and Raffles' and Crawfurd's conjectures as to the difference of the calendar in Java and Bali can be solved by assuming that the Balinese have retained the ancient and true calendar, whilst the Javanese, through Muhammadan influence, have forgotten how to calculate the solar year, and have, therefore, got seven or eight years further from Saka than they should be.\n\nAll the months but two (Jyes'ta and As'ada) have both Sanskrit and Balinese names.\n\nThe Sanskrit names are:\n\n1. Sr\u0101vana.\n2. B\u0101dra or B\u0101dravada (Sanskrit Badrapada).\n3. As'ad\u012b or As'ado (derived from As'ayu).\n4. K\u0101rttika.\n5. M\u0101rgas'ira or M\u0101rgas'irya.\n\nThe Balinese names for the first ten are the ordinal numbers from 1 to 10:\n\n1. Kas.\n2. Karu.\n3. Sanga.\n4. Kapat.\n5. K\u0101tima.\n6. Kasana.\n7. Kapita.\n8. Kabula.\n9. Kasanga.\n10. Kadasa.\n\nWe have no Balinese names for Jyes'ta and As'ada (vulgo Sodha), and this leads us to suspect that the original Balinese-Javanese year, like that of the ancient Romans, had only 10 months. Now we find in the purely Balinese calendar, of which we shall speak shortly, divisions of 35 days or 5 weeks, which, it is true, do not now possess a special name, but no doubt originally corresponded with the 10 months; 10 times 35 gives about the duration of the year of lunar months, 354 days. The addition of Jyes'ta and As'ada, then, occurred at a later period, when Indian influence had led to\nthe division of the year into 12 months, each of 29 or 30 days.\n\nIn the year 1847 the first day of the month Kasanga or Chetra was on the 16th of February; in 1848 on the 5th of February; in 1849 it will fall on the 24th of January. In 1844, on the contrary, it was on the 24th of March, almost on the day on which, according to Wilson, the Indian month Chetra should begin. Although in Bali, from ignorance of the calculations, the method of fixing the solar year is obscure, and is known but imperfectly to a few learned priests (who themselves cannot properly explain the reasons for it), yet we learn from the tables called Pengalihan wulan (the searching of the moon) how the time of the Balinese calculation is brought into accordance with that of the lunar months: 64 lunar months, of which 30 are of 29 and 34 of 30 days, give us 1890 days, which agree with 9 Balinese years of 210 days.\n\nAccording to the Indian calculation, there should be one or two intercalary months next year (1849), because then the difference between the solar and the lunar year will be from the 24th of January to the 20th of March, and will thus amount to 55 days; nothing, however, has yet been said to me of any such intention. In India, as we have already pointed out, there are 2 intercalary months every 5 years called Malimlucha; this name is unknown in Bali, nor have I heard any name which could correspond to it.\n\nThe six Indian seasons do not exist in Bali. The lunar months are chiefly important for fixing certain feasts. For all other dates use is made solely of\n\n**The Balinese Calendar.**\n\nThis is formed by a combination of the Polynesian week of 5 days (pahing, puan, wage, kaliwon, manis) with the Indian week of 7 days (Rediti, Soma, Anggara, Budd'a, Wr\u00e9haspati,\n\n---\n\n1 The name Rediti can only be explained by Aditia, \"sun.\" The substitution of r\u00e9 for d may well have arisen by the uncommon initial s having been taken for the sign rd, which is very well known. Wr\u00e9haspati is found in good MSS. for Respati, which is the ordinary pronunciation.\nSukra, Sanes'chara); this combination gives us 35 days, which form the basis of the Balinese calendar; we write them thus:\n\n| Budda kaliwon, | Soma pahing, | Sanes'chara wage, |\n|----------------|--------------|------------------|\n| Wr\u0113haspati manis, | Anggara puan, | Rediti kaliwon, |\n| Sukra pahing, | Budda wage, | Soma manis, |\n| Sanes'chara puan, | Wr\u0113haspati kaliwon, | Anggara pahing, |\n| Rediti wage, | Sukra manis, | Budda puan, |\n| Soma kaliwon, | Sanes'chara pahing, | Wr\u0113haspati wage, |\n| Anggara manis, | Rediti puan, | Sukra kaliwon, |\n| Budda pahing, | Soma wage, | Sanes'chara manis, |\n| Wr\u0113haspati puan, | Anggara kaliwon, | Rediti pahing, |\n| Sukra wage, | Budda manis, | Soma puan, |\n| Sanes'chara kaliwon, | Wr\u0113haspati pahing, | Anggara wage. |\n| Rediti manis, | Sukra puan, | |\n\nWe find these combinations of 35 days six times in each Balinese year of 210 days, but they are not called months. On the other hand, each of the 30 weeks has its own name. We find these names in Raffles, vol. i. p. 476. The order of sequence is the same in Bali, but some names must be corrected. Each division begins with Budda kaliwon, the day on which Galungan, the Balinese new year, falls, and not on Rediti (or Diti) Pahing, as Raffles asserts. The week in which the year begins is Dunghulan; Sinta, however, is always named as the first week in Bali, as in Java; the names are:\n\n1. Sinta\n2. Land\u0113p\n3. Wukir\n4. Kurantil\n5. Tolu\n6. G\u016bmr\u0113g\n7. Wariga\n8. Warigadian, or Wariganing Wariga\n9. Julung Wangi,\n10. Julung Sungasang\n11. Dunghulan (in Raffles Galungan)\n12. Kuningan\n13. Langkir\n14. Madang Siha\n15. Julung Pujut\n16. Pahang\n17. Kurw'lut\n18. Marakih\n19. Tambir\n20. Madangkungang\n21. Mahatal\n22. Huje\n23. M\u0113nahil\n24. Prang Bakat\n25. Bula Muki\n26. Hugu\n27. Wayang\n28. Kulawu\n29. Dukut\n30. Watu gunung.\n\nRaffles, vol. i. p. 376 sqq., gives the fable respecting the origin of these names of the weeks. I have not yet heard anything of it in Bali. In Bali this division, like the rest of the calendar, is said to be derived from India. Its introduc-\ntion was no doubt made by the priests at an early period, in order to add to the sanctity of the religious feasts and institutions, which are regulated according to this calendar.\\(^1\\)\n\nOf the 35 days the first, eleventh, and twenty-first (Budda kaliwon, Sane'schara kaliwon and Anggara kaliwon) are sacred. Here again, therefore, the decimal system prevails. In the first five weeks, the feast of Galungan, the new year, falls on Budda kaliwon, the feast of Kuningan (in Crawfurd Galunan and Kuninan) on Sane'schara kaliwon, and finally the feast in the principal temple of Uluwatu in Badong on Anggara kaliwon.\n\nSome Balinese only call this year of 210 days a half-year. It is indeed, however, their civil year, and they are only disposed to regard it as a half-year to make it agree with the Muhammadan, Chinese, and European year.\n\nEach of these 35 days has a constellation, which indicates its good or evil qualities, and is of special importance for nativities; these constellations are not the same, however, as our own, or even as the Indian, for, with the exception of the Waluku (Orion) and the Krettika (the Pleiades), the signs are somewhat arbitrary.\n\n**Astrological Calendar.**\n\nThese constellations, which decide the good or evil fortune of the day, are called lintangan (lintang=bintang, \"star\"). They are supposed to pass into the body of people born on that day.\n\n*Rediti manis* has the Ancha-ancha, a human figure standing on its head and hands. People born on that day have weak bodies and weak voices, but are impertinent to their parents.\n\n*Rediti pahing*, the Gaja, elephant. This signifies sorrow caused by other people.\n\n*Rediti puan.*\u2014Patr\u00eam, the creese. This signifies a predisposition to suicide.\n\n\\(^1\\) *Sapta Resi* (the seven ancient saints, sages) are said to have prepared it.

Much misfortune. Repeated illness.\n\nThere is not much astronomical science in all this, and many of the ideas are really ridiculous, yet the Balinese attach value to them, and those who are born on a day with a good constellation often boast of it.\n\nIn addition to these astrological meanings of the 35 days, there are for each of the seven days of the week: (1) a god, who presides over it; (2) a human figure, indicating the character of the person; (3) a tree; (4) a bird; (5) a buta (demon); (6) a satwa (beast). The nature of these is supposed to indicate what the character of the person born on that day will be.\nThe seven gods are given, following the order of the days of the week, beginning with Sunday, as follows: Indra, Uma, Brahma, Vishnu, Guru, Sri, Yama; or, according to another account, Indra, Pratilai, Visnun, Brahma, Guru, Uma, Durga.\n\nThe seven Butas are: Hulu asu (dog's head), Hulu k'bo (buffalo's head), Hulu kuda (horse's head), Hulu lembu (cow's head), Hulu singha (lion's head), Hulu gajia (elephant's head), Hulu gagak (crow's head). From these the man obtains his passions, and from the beasts his lower qualities.\n\nAccording to the astrological notions of the Balinese, the day is divided into five parts, each of which has a separate name, although they occur in different order on different days. Raffles also mentions a division of the day into five parts in Java; but in Bali we have different names and rules for this division. The principal part is called Mreta (Amr\u0113ta); he who is born at this time of day is certain to have good fortune. The five parts of the days undergo twelve changes, and to know their order on a particular day, the number of the day of the Indian week is added to that of the day of the Polynesian week, and the result is one of the twelve combinations of the five parts of the day (and also of the night). The rest of the divisions (besides Mreta) are sumpa (empty, poor), kala (passionate; after the god Kala), pati (must die), layok (will become bad and thievish). The day is further divided, in a civil aspect, into eight hours, dadauhun, calculated from sunrise to sunset (their names are, dauh pisan, stroke one, dauh ro, dauh tiga or tetu, etc.). The night is also divided into eight parts in the same manner. To find the hour, a sort of water-clock (clepsydra) is used, consisting of a clapper with a little hole in its bottom, which rests on the water. As soon as the clapper is filled, it is emptied by an attendant, and the number of strokes are given at the same time upon a drum. Contrivances of this kind are to be found in the principal palaces\u2014e.g. in Den Passar (in Badong), Mengwi, etc.\n\nThe lunar month is divided into the white and the black half, s'ukla-pok'sa and kres'na-pok'sa (literally, the white and black wing), as is the case in India. The days of the white half are called tunggal, and are reckoned from new to full moon;\nthose of the black half are called pangluang. To describe a date, the Balinese give the day of the week (of the Indian week of seven days as well as of the Polynesian of five), the name of the week (according to the Balinese division of 30 weeks), the name and the half of the lunar month (white or black), the day of that half, and finally the year, calculated from Saka. Instead of the year of Saka, they also give simply the year of the century, the century itself being understood. The century is divided into 10 divisions, each of 10 years; each such division is called tenggek, each single year rah. Thus we have, for instance, on the 26th of June, 1847, Saneschara (Saturday) kalivon (according to the Polynesian week) wara Landap (in the week of Landap) masa kasa (in the month of Kasa) sukla pak\u2019sa (in the white half; also simply tanggal, with a waxing moon) ping 13 (on the thirteenth day) rah 9, tenggek 6 (thus 69). Adding to this the century (1700), we get the year of Saka 1769, to which 78 must be added to arrive at the year of our Lord (1847).\n\nBesides the Wriga garga, which, as we have said, is entirely of Indian origin, there are two other works upon the calendar, which, however, are no longer used; their titles are Sundari\\(^1\\) trus and Sundari bungka. As I have not yet been able to get a sight of them, I cannot say much about them. The Pandita in Taman said that these works are more recent than the Wriga Garga, and were composed in Java, whereas the Wriga Garga was composed in India (Kling). They were used formerly, but the Balinese priests have given the preference to the older Wriga Garga. This also is an instance of their adherence to all that is ancient and, in their opinion, of Indian origin. The Wriga Garga appears to date from the time of the kingdom of Daha (Kediri), whence our priests are descended, and which kingdom, as we have seen, they often confound with India and call Baratawarea.\n\nWe have enumerated in the Tijdsch. van N. I. 8, 4, 211, still further divisions of time, namely a dvivara, trivara, cha-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The name Sundari is Sanskrit, and means \u201cthe fair one.\u201d Trus and bungka are Polynesian additions; the former seems to indicate that it contains a continuous calendar.\ntavara, sadvara, astavara, sangavara, and dasavara, besides\nthe septavara and panchavara; all these are less prominent\nin ordinary life. The trivara serves to indicate the market-\ndays, as the Panchavara does in Java; there is a market\nevery third day (Dvaraj).\n\nThe s'udvara is often found in dates added to the septavara\nand panchavara. The names of the sadvara are Polynesian:\nTunggleh, Haryang, Warukung, Paniron, Was, Mahalu. Thus\nthe first day of the week Sinta is Tunggleh Pahing Redili,\nthe second Haryang Puan Soma, the third Warukung Wage\nanggara, the fourth Paniron Kaluon Budha, the fifth Was\nMans Wrehaspatt, the sixth Mahalu Pahing Sukra, the\nseventh Tunggleh Pauin Sanechaha. The remaining divisions\nare chiefly used for astrological definitions. I have not yet\ndiscovered clearly how the astavara are brought into accord-\nance with the tutelar deities attributed to each of the seven\ndays of the week (see above). The names of the gods of the\nAstavara are: Sri, Indra, Guru, Yama, Rudra, Brahma,\nKala, Uma; the tutelar gods of the seven week-days are:\nIndra, Uma, Brahma, Wisnu, Guru, Sri, Yama, or, accor-\nding to the other account, Indra, Pretwi, Wisnu, Brahma,\nGuru, Uma, Durga.\n\nThe zodiac (rasil) is also used for astrological purposes. We\nhave given the names in the Tijds. v. N. i. 8, 4, 211. In\ngood MSS. we find them written still better according to the\nSanskrit. The signs of the zodiac, which I found drawn in\na manuscript, are the Indian ones; there is no aquarius, but\nonly the water-pitcher (kumba), and instead of the ram there\nis a shrimp (udang=makara). Mrchika is Skrt. Wrischiku,\nthe scorpion. Rakata should be Karkata. What is most re-\nmarkable is, however, the absence of the tula (scales) in the\nmanuscript referred to. This could not be an accidental\nomission, for the claws of the scorpion stretch over the\nplace where the tula ought to have been, and the scorpion\nthus took up the room of two signs. Now it is well known\nthat the Greeks in ancient times had only eleven signs of the\nzodiac, and that it was precisely the scales which were absent,\nand also that it is supposed that the scales originated out of\nthe claws of the scorpion; although it is not certain whether a sign was lost in the course of transmission from the East (or from Egypt), or whether there were only eleven originally. The discovery of a zodiac with eleven signs in India now renders this question still more intricate. This zodiac cannot have come from the West, for the entirely Indian character of our zodiac excludes this theory; we must therefore suppose that in India also the zodiac once had but eleven signs, and that it was not till later times that the scales were added both in India and in Greece. In Bali all twelve signs are given by name, and thus here also a twelfth has been added; but the fact that we found in Bali the drawing referred to proves that at the time of the first intercourse between India and Java the zodiac still had but eleven signs in the former country. It is not known whether a similar zodiac has been found in India, but it would be of the highest importance to obtain further information from there on this point, and if possible to determine the age of such representations, which would furnish a date of the utmost importance both for the history of astronomy and for that of civilization in Java.\n\nThe eclipses of the sun and moon are explained in Bali, as in India, as the devouring of these bodies by a demon (Rahu); the eclipses of the sun are called graha and those of the moon rahu, which in India, however, is no distinction, as the former means the act of devouring and the latter the devouring demon. To help the moon on these occasions, the Balinese make a terrible noise with their rice-blocks and other instruments, as they do on the eve of Galungan and of the fast-days (ny\u00e9pi), when the evil spirits are driven away by noise. The Panditas know that Europeans predict the eclipses of the sun and moon, and questioned me about it; they themselves, however, are ignorant of the method of calculation. They also keep this knowledge secret from the people, as the following instance will show. A European, Mr. M., lived some time in Tabanan, and was very intimate with the young prince. On the approach of an eclipse of the moon, he predicted its occurrence to the prince, who was very pleased thereat, but was compelled by his priests to banish\nthe European from his country, for since the European knew more than the priests, it necessarily followed that he was possessed of an evil spirit from which he obtained his knowledge. Had the European first told it to the priests, they would not have driven him from the country, but would have displayed their knowledge to the people.\n\nAs I do not possess a MS. of the Wriga Garga, I cannot give here any further information as to the astronomical and astrological science of the Balinese, although it is most worthy of attention. The greater portion of the people are still utterly ignorant of the calendar. Even among the priests this science is only retained mechanically; but what knowledge they have they use especially to make the people dependent upon them. Every important undertaking requires the help of the priest as the mediator with the deity, and as astronomer and astrologer.\nART. IV.\u2014Unpublished Glass Weights and Measures. By Edward Thomas Rogers.\n\nIn a paper published in the Numismatic Chronicle (1873, Part I. page 60), I enumerated and described all the glass discs with Kufic inscriptions which had till then come under my notice; comprising those in my own cabinet, M. Sauvaire's collection, and others in the possession of the Rev. Greville Chester. I then advanced my reasons for believing that these discs were standard coin-weights. The theory that they were tokens, or equivalents of coins, had been supported by several learned writers; but all those students and collectors with whom I have since been in communication now recognize them as weights.\n\nA short time ago I had the privilege of visiting the Slade collection in the British Museum, under the guidance of its learned Curator, Mr. A. W. Franks, who kindly allowed me to examine those specimens of Oriental glass in which I take special interest; and who has since furnished me with casts of three glass discs, to which it is one of my objects in the present paper to draw special attention.\n\nTwo of these discs are undoubtedly weights; but the third belongs to a different category, specimens of which are so rare that I have only met with three examples, and I am not aware that any one of them has been published.\n\nIt is in fact a stamp, broken from a vessel manufactured by authority, and issued for use as a measure of capacity. It thus possesses a new and special interest, in that it shows the application of glass by the Arabs to a use of which modern students were not aware.\n\nI have to express my thanks to Lord Talbot de Malahide for having, by the intervention of Mr. R. S. Poole, kindly allowed me the privilege of examining a collection of glass weights acquired by his Lordship during a visit to Egypt last\nGLASS WEIGHTS AND MEASURES OF CAPACITY. PL.

Dark bluish green, transparent; diameter 1\u00b77 inch. Slade Collection, B.M. Fig. 1.\n\nThe reverse, instead of being flat, has in the centre a convex projection, surrounded by a concave depression with irregularly broken and jagged edges, suggesting the idea that this plaque had formed part of a vessel, a bottle or a vase. On the obverse there is an inscription in seven lines, surrounded and partially covered by a raised rim. It is evident that the inscription and the marginal rim were produced from two different moulds, and I am inclined to believe that the former was first impressed, and that before the glass had had time to cool, the mould of the latter was pressed over it, thus obliterating portions of some of the words.\n\n\u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 | \u0627\u0645\u0631 \u0639\u0628\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 | \u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062c\u0627\u0628 \u0631\u0628\u0639 | \u0642\u0633\u0637 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u064a\u062f\u064a \u062d\u0627 | \u0645\n\u0628\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u0631\u0645 \u0633\u0646\u0629 | \u0627\u062d\u062f\u0647 \u0639\u0634\u0631\u0629 \u0648 | \u0633\u0646\u0647\n\nIn the name of God, by order of 'Ubaid-allah-ibn-al-Habbab, the quarter of a Kist, by the hands of . . . . . . -ibn- . . . . . . in the year one hundred and eleven.\n\nThis disc, then, as I have intimated above, is not a weight, but the official stamp on a measure of capacity. The \u0642 of the word \u0642\u0633\u0637 is obliterated, as indeed are several other letters, by the super-posing of the marginal rim, but there seems no reason for doubting that \u0642\u0633\u0637 is the measure intended; that reading being confirmed by another somewhat similar stamp more recently discovered, on which this word occurs and is perfectly preserved.\n\nThe Kist, which is not to my knowledge in use, either in Egypt or Syria, is described in the dictionaries as a measure equal to half a sa'a (\u0635\u0627\u0639); and Don V. Vazquez-Queipo, in his *Essai sur les syst\u00e8mes m\u00e9triques et mon\u00e9taires*,\u00b9 describes the\n\n\u00b9 vol. ii. p. 249.\nKist as the equivalent of half a sa'a, and he reduces it to its French equivalent of 1\u00b7377 litre; consequently its quarter, to which this stamp belonged, would be 0\u00b7344 litre, or a little over half a pint English measure.\n\nThe functionary by whose order this stamp was issued, 'Ubaid-allah-ibn-al-Habhab, was appointed Minister of Finance in Egypt, under the Governorship of Al-Hurr-ibn-Y\u00fasuf, in A.H. 106. He retained that office under several successive Governors; the last under whom he served being Al-Wal\u00edd-ibn-Raff\u00e1'ah, in whose time, A.H. 111, this authorized measure was used.\n\nThis name appears on a glass weight, No. 373, published by the learned, but not always careful, Pietraszewski in his \"Numi Mohammedani,\" under the heading of \"Assignationes \u2014alio modo: signata argentea;\" but he has not attempted to identify this \"Emir Chabchab,\" limiting himself, as many other numismatic writers have done, to a bare description of the coin or so-called \"token,\" without attempting to deduce, from the name or date, any proof or illustration of historical facts; an omission much to be regretted in such works. I have not succeeded in deciphering the name of the officer or artificer \"by whose hands\" this stamp was made or issued.\n\nNo. 2. Green, transparent; diameter 1\u00b725 inch. Lord Talbot.\n\nFig. 2.\n\nThe reverse presents a similar appearance to that of No. 1, showing that it also formed part of a glass measure of capacity.\n\nThe inscription on the obverse is in four lines.\n\nBy order of . . . . . son of . . . . . quarter of a Kist . . . .\n\nThe officer by whose authority it was issued is the same \u062d\u0645\u0627\u0631 \u0628\u0646 \u0633\u0631\u062d, whose name appears on a weight, No. 371, erroneously described by Pietraszewski, who reads \u0628\u0627\u0645\u0631 \u062d\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0646 \u0634\u0631\u064a\u0641 \u0645\u062b\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u064a\u0646\u0627\u0631 \u0648\u0627\u0641\u0631.\n\n1 The weight here referred to has happily passed into our National Collection, and I have had the satisfaction of examining it in the Medal room at the British Museum. I can thus testify to the accuracy of the engraving in Pietraszewski's \"Tabulae Numorum,\" and to the inaccuracy of his reading and description.\nHimma? filius Scherifi? pretium dynari abundantis.\" On comparing this reading with the engraving in the \"Tabulae Numerum,\" we find a great discrepancy. In the engraving we find \u0633\u0631\u0686 just as on the disc before us, but the Professor reads \u0634\u0631\u0641. The word which in the engraving is \u062c\u0632\u0621 weight, is translated \"pretium,\" for the Professor, believing that he had a token or glass bank-note in his hand, was induced to convert \u062c\u0632\u0621 into \u0645\u0633\u062c. The word he read \u0648\u0627\u0641\u0631 should of course be \u0648\u0627\u0641\u0631.\n\nThis disc is interesting in that it represents the same measure as No. 1, namely the quarter of a Kisq, a measure I believe to be obsolete. I have not yet identified the officer by whose authority it was issued, nor can I give any satisfactory explanation of the words \u0633\u0631 \u062d\u0631\u0627\u0645 at the end of the inscription.\n\nNo. 3. Green, transparent; shown to me by a gentleman travelling in the East a few years ago, who kindly allowed me to take a copy of it. I think it was Mr. Henry Moore.\n\nInscription in five lines:\n\n\u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0627\u0645\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0626\u062f | \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 | \u0645\u0643\u062d\u0644\u0629 \u0634\u0631\u0642 | \u0646\u062f\u0648\u0627\u0641\u0646\n\nIn the name of God, by order of Al-Kaid Ubaid-allah, measure (to the brim) . . . . full measure.\n\nThe word \u0645\u0643\u062d\u0644\u0629 from \u0643\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u064a\u0643\u0644\u0645 to measure, may possibly be here used in its generic sense, followed by the specific \u0633\u0631\u0686 or \u0633\u0631\u0686, the meaning of which is doubtful; or it may be that the word is used as a conventionally specific measure, followed by the word which I read with some diffidence as \u0634\u0631\u0642 brim or edge. Derivations of the verb \u0643\u0644\u0627\u0644 are used in parts of Egypt and Syria for various specific measures, notably the \u0643\u0644\u0627\u0644, which is Europeanized by Levantine merchants in the word Kilo de Constantinople.\n\nI have not yet identified the functionary by whose authority this stamp was issued.\n\nI feel confident that the discovery of these stamps of measures of capacity will prove of great interest to all Orientalists, and especially to Archaeologists and Numismatists; and I must\napologize for the several lacunae which will be observed in this description of them, and which must be attributed to my deficient information. I hope that other specimens of these stamps will be found, and that thereby further light may be thrown on this interesting subject.\n\nI will now submit a few unpublished glass weights, from which further evidence of their intended use may be deduced. I will begin with those denoting the weights of the fils, the copper coinage of the Eastern Khalifahs.\n\nGlass Fils-Weight.\n\nNo. 4.

But in another respect it is of special interest.\n\nThe few weights of filsas hitherto published, and to which but little attention has been paid, are all of thirty Khar\u00fabahs, and are in some instances described as fils al Kabir, \u0641\u0644\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631 \"the large fils.\" The weight now under consideration is described as that of a fils, and is then declared to be of only\n\n---\n\n1 I am desirous of correcting an error, into which I was not unnaturally led by an imperfection in the die, in my reading of the inscription on a glass weight, No. 37, in my paper published in the Num. Chron., 1873, p. 67. I diffidently read on the imperfect die \u0641\u0634 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0631, but this, from subsequent comparison and analogy, I am glad now to be able to interpret as \u0641\u0644\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631 the large fils.\n\nThe Numismatic Department of the British Museum possesses two duplicates of this weight. The functionary, Al-K\u0101sim-ibn-'Ubaid-Allah, by whose authority it was issued, was probably the minister of that name who was appointed on his father's death in A.H. 288 as his successor in the post of Wazir by the Khalifah Al-Mu'tadid, and who died in A.H. 295.\ntwenty Kharubaha, thus showing a reason why another weight is described as that of the large filo, and proving that there was a second recognized and authorized weight for a filo.\n\nAnother disc in my own collection, which I shall next describe, shows that there was a third, and\u2014if I am not mistaken in my reading of a rather imperfect weight in the British Museum\u2014even a fourth recognized standard weight for the filo.\n\nAll collectors of Kufic coins know that amongst filos there is a great variety in their diameter, thickness and weight, but no importance has hitherto been attached by collectors to these varieties. None of the descriptive catalogues of public or private collections of Oriental coins give the weights of the copper coins, not even the careful Maresden; though he describes one piece as a \"double obolus,\" thus proving that he had observed a great difference in the weights of the copper coins in his collection.\n\nNo. 6.

But a variation of from 37 to 100 is far too great to be accounted for in that way, and I had been induced to attribute great carelessness to the mint-masters when I found filses weighing 100 grains, 90\u00b79 being the recognized weight. But now that a glass standard of 99\u00b79 grains has been found, we must rather pay tribute to their general accuracy, and attribute each extant fils to the category to which it is nearest in weight, allowing for the difference by corrosion or abrasion.\n\nNo. 6.

The word, however, when read as thulthain, 'two-thirds,' is at once suggestive; and if we regard this weight as representing that of a dirham, afterwards, for greater accuracy, described in the same inscription as two-thirds (of a din\u00e1r in ellipse), we find that it perfectly agrees with the weight of a dirham of that period, and also with two-thirds of that of a din\u00e1r of the same period.\nYaz\u00edd-ibn-H\u00e1tim, who authorized the issue of this weight, was appointed by the \u2019Abb\u00e1si Khal\u00edfah Al-Mans\u00far, to the governorship of Egypt in A.H. 144, which post he retained till A.H. 152. This weight was therefore probably issued in the interval.\n\nWe find many d\u00edn\u00e1rs of the Khal\u00edfah Al-Mans\u00far weighing 66 grains or a fraction less; of which 44 grains, the weight of this disc, would represent two-thirds.\n\nThe word \u0645\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0644\u064e is written without the l; but whether we regard this omission as effected by the licence adopted by early Arabic writers, e.g. \u062f\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e\u0627\u0631 for \u062f\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e\u0627\u0631, etc., or look upon the word without the l as another part of the same verb, the meaning would be virtually the same: thus, \u0645\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0644\u064e that which equals a weight, and \u0645\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0644\u064e a weight.\n\nThus we have three recognized weights for the dirham. Firstly the seven-tenths of a d\u00edn\u00e1r, as given by historical records, and proved by extant specimens, as well as by glass weight No. 11, to be 45 or 45\u00b75 grains; secondly, the glass weight No. 12, described as a dirham, two-thirds of a d\u00edn\u00e1r, or 44 grains; and thirdly, glass weight No. 10 (and No. 38 in my former paper, Num. Chron. 1873, page 68; see fig. 12), described as thirteen Khar\u00fabahs=42\u00b74 grains.\n\nGlass D\u00edn\u00e1r-Weights.\n\nNo. 13. Brown, transparent; diameter 1 inch; weight 65\u00b73 grains.

This is, therefore, my justification for supplying the\nword din\u00e1r as the ellipse in the dirham-weight No. 12, which is described as two-thirds.\n\nThe above din\u00e1r-weights, extending over a period of more than two centuries, show very slight variations, proving that the din\u00e1r or gold coin was the standard of currency and of monetary weights. The silver currency represented by the dirham varied slightly from time to time; and the copper represented by the f\u012bs varied to the extent of a hundred per cent., but the din\u00e1r retained very nearly, and probably exactly, the same weight throughout that period, excepting during the reign of Al-Mans\u016br, when it was increased by half a grain.\n\nLarger Weights.\n\nNo. 19.

This word ratl is a generic term for a heavy weight, but it has always been used also for a specific weight, though varying from time to time and contemporaneously, in different places. Thus in Egypt, at the present day, the ratl is about equal to an English pound avoirdupois; while in Syria it is equal to about six pounds and a half. Kazimirsky correctly describes its second meaning as \"un poids qui varie selon les pays.\"\n\nThe Uk\u00edyah or ounce of the present day in Egypt is the twelfth part of a ratl, and weighs, according to Mr. Lane's calculation (Modern Egyptians), from 571\u00bd to 576 English\ngrains. This disc weighs exactly twice 571\u00bd grains, or two ukiyahs. May we not, therefore, accept it as the equivalent of two ukiyahs, and infer that at the period of its issue the ratl contained only eight ukiyahs, instead of twelve as at present?\n\nNo. 20.

Immediately on my arrival in Cairo last week, I was visited by several dealers in coins and other antiquities, from whom I have, from time to time, made purchases for many years past. One of them had in his possession a glass disc, which I at once recognized as belonging to the category of stamps on measures of capacity above described. I purchased it and added it to my collection. It is of green glass, transparent, and bears the following inscription in five lines:\n\n\u0628\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 | \u0627\u0645\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0631 | \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 (\u0628\u0634\u0631\u061f) | \u0646\u0635\u0641 \u0642\u0633\u0637 | \u0648\u0627\u0641\n\nIn the name of God, by order of the Amir Muhammad, son of (Bashr?), half a Kist, full measure.\nI afterwards paid a visit to my friend, Yacoub Artin Bey, and was much pleased to find in his possession another stamp of the same description. It is also of green transparent glass, with the following inscription in five lines:\n\n\u0633\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0645\u0631\u064b\u0627 \u0628\u0647 \u0639\u0628\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 | \u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062c\u0627\u0628 | \u0642\u0633\u0637 \u0648\u0627 | \u0641\n\nOf those ordered by 'Ubaid-Allah, son of Al-Habbhab, a Kist, full measure.\n\nThese two discs added to those above described form a complete series of quarter, half, and whole kist. That belonging to Yacoub Artin Bey bears the name of the same functionary, by whose authority was issued the quarter-kist in the Slade collection; but the latter is the only one yet discovered bearing the date of its emission.\n\nI have made inquiries here as to the present use of the word kist as applied to a measure of capacity; and find that the vessel used for dipping into the oil-jars is called \u0642\u0633\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u0632\u064a\u062a the oil-kist, or the cruise of oil, but it is of no specified size; and the word is obsolete as applied to any fixed measure of capacity.\n\nE. T. R.\n\nCAIRO, June 8, 1877.\nART. V.\u2014China via Tibet. By S. C. Boulger.\n\nOne of the stipulations contained in the Convention recently signed at Che-foo by Sir Thomas Wade, and the Chinese statesman Li-Hung-Chang, sets forth that a mission is to be sanctioned between China and India through Tibet; or, to state this fact more comprehensively, that intercourse between India and Tibet has at last received the Imperial consent of Pekin. To those persons who are sceptical as to the amount of faith to be reposed in written agreements between nations, there can be no more potent confirmation for their disbelief than the perusal of those made hitherto between this country and China. Yet it must be confessed that, in this, our own lethargy has been quite as much to blame as the Chinese diplomatic craft in neglecting to fulfil promises, which we have seemed content to let remain empty words. The treaty just signed as the consummation of the long-pending negotiations arising from the murder of Mr. Margary supplements that of Tientsin made some seventeen years ago. In its phrasing it may not be more liberal, but, as it has been obtained by peaceful means, it has claims, so far, to be considered the greater success. A few more ports have been added to those to which the foreigner is already admitted, but some of its fiscal details have, for some reason or other, excited considerable disapproval among those interested in that part of the question. It is not my intention here to dilate upon the justice or injustice of these dissentients. It is my opinion that we have now very seriously to consider, whether it would not be a wiser course for us to regard the vital clauses of this agreement as worth an effort to enforce, than by a temporarily self-deluding, but culpable indifference, to continue to hand down a legacy of convention-framing, with the possibility of\nan ever-present war as the result of a failure in diplomacy, to succeeding decades. On this occasion, we have one pre-eminently favourable concession made to us; but, if it is not to become, practically, a dead letter, like so many of its predecessors, there must be no delay in putting it into execution. The abrogation of this clause must not be condoned by too lenient custom, and its observance may, at all events, be made to serve as a useful precedent in the future. I do not think, therefore, that I shall be endeavouring to draw public attention to an unimportant topic, if I venture to state, at some length, the reasons for which it is wise and politic to realize the advantages our diplomatist has secured for us with reference to Tibet. I do not hesitate to assert, in the commencement, that this can be made the most valuable concession we have ever obtained at the hands of the Chinese.\n\nIt is not necessary here to waste time and space on any details of the lonely journey of Mr. Margary, or of the fruitless expedition intended to promote land communication with China through Burma. The actors in that unhappy catastrophe may exclaim, \"quae regio in terris nostri non plena laboris.\" The motives that gave rise to that enterprise were most laudable, but the narratives of Dr. Anderson, and of Mr. Margary himself, setting forth the difficulties of the enterprise and the poverty of the part of China immediately concerned, the accuracy of which has been more than confirmed by the Grosvenor mission, must certainly damp the expectations of those who were most sanguine as to success. Perhaps also the chief objection has not yet been stated to this route. The country through which the caravans would have to pass is in many parts unsettled, and infested with bands of robber clans, unamenable to any authority, and outrages would repeatedly take place for which we should be compelled to exact redress. The punishment of such acts would entail so much expense and worry on our Government that the only remedy would eventually be found, either in giving up our own operations, a course which would be found practically impossible, or in\nannexing the intermediate territory, an alternative as objectionable as it well could be. If no other way of securing direct land communication with China can be found, then the end in view may justify the risk attendant on an adoption of this route; but as we have ready to our hands another mode of securing this most desirable advantage, and offering at the same time great recommendations of its own, there can be no question of our wisdom in putting its efficacy to the test. A trade with Tibet, and with China afterwards through Tibet, would not be accompanied by any of the dangers incurred on the route through Birm\u00e1. The Tibetans are a peace-loving, honest people; they possess great virtues, and, so far as we know, few vices. Their country is settled, has been well governed for ages, and in it there are good roads and important river highways. Beyond our frontier there are no robber clans, who would cause us continual trouble until extirpated, and exact the same part as the Afr\u00e9edees are performing, much to our annoyance, at the present time on our north-western borders, and which the Kakhyns would also perform in the event of traffic beyond Mandalay. Consequently, one of the chief arguments in favour of the Tibet route to China is, that, in its essence, it would be a peaceful measure, and that it would require less direct interference on the part of the Government than any of its rivals. It would exist, I submit, having once been fairly started, on the true principle of reciprocity of interests. At any time a war with China is a pitiable calamity, and none are better aware of the truth of this than those, who know how close we have, at several moments lately, been to one. One of the sure results of such an occurrence would be the occupation by us of more territory, and, however advantageous in a strategical point of view the possession of an island or another strip of land might be, this would be an unmitigated catastrophe for the true interests of both countries. Not only does each acquisition leave a permanent object to remind every loyal and patriotic Chinaman\u2014and, be it remembered, loyalty and patriotism are quite as great virtues among Chinamen as among Englishmen\u2014that we\nare on his soil as much as conquerors as merchants and representatives of the most enlightened ideas of civilization; but it also adds, indefinitely, to our own responsibility, without making our power one iota more real. Regarded from this point of view the possession of Hong Kong and Shanghai is an evil, however necessary in the past it may have been, and however salutary in the future the turn of events may make it. To explain my meaning more clearly, let us take an illustration. The Americans and Germans have great interests in China; and it is quite possible, perhaps probable, therefore, that some day or other a cause of dispute may arise between those powers and the Chinese. A war might ensue, and part of the terms of peace dictated by the conquerors would, almost certainly, be the cession of some permanent foot-hold on the country. This event, to which we have ourselves unfortunately furnished the precedent, would not only displease, it would also seriously alarm us. And why? In all probability it will occur some day, and what have we logically to advance against it?\n\nTo avoid war with China, and at the same time to maintain our dignity in the eyes of the Chinese, requires no ordinary amount of tact and firmness on the part of our resident minister in Pekin; but this object can only be permanently secured by an increase in friendly feeling between the two peoples, and friendly feeling cannot arise without mutual knowledge. As the time has passed by in the present phase of Anglo-Chinese affairs for those who argue for an addition to our hold upon China, so must every effort be made to take the greatest possible advantage of the present settlement to promote good feeling, and to increase the ties of friendship and of reciprocal utility between the English and the Chinese. The greatest incentive to war will have been removed when ignorance shall have given place to greater knowledge, and when the inhabitants of the innermost provinces of that great empire shall recognize the white man, whom they contemptuously designate \"foreign devil,\" and who they have heard is tolerated in some of their seaports, as their most powerful and immediate neighbour.\nWhen the people of Szechuen and Shensi wear Manchester goods and use Sheffield cutlery, when they are forced to acknowledge that honesty is the guiding principle of English merchants, and when, on the other hand, the caravans bearing the silk and tea of China come pouring, in half the time and at half the expense that they do at present, through the passes of Sikhim and Bhutan, to enrich the markets of India, then we may well feel confident that the Chinese people, who are, even at this moment, progressing so rapidly towards more enlightened ideas, and whose virtues we have hitherto to a great extent shut our eyes to, will be more eager to recognize our position with regard to themselves, for this perception will have been brought home to them by the most forcible of all arguments, benefit to themselves. Our object is not, therefore, to rest content with having obtained the removal of trade restrictions from a few additional ports; it must be our ambition to make China take her place as one of the great free countries of the world. The greatest step in this direction being, undoubtedly, the inauguration of intercourse by land between India and China, we have to discover how this can best be effected. The route through Birm\u0101 having been tried, and resulted in seeming failure, we have to consider the alternative one through Tibet. As the Chinese have removed their veto, which was the fundamental objection to its being essayed, it behoves us to test its practicability without any unnecessary delay. The clause expressing this concession is not only a most important diplomatic success, but it may also be made to serve, as I have endeavoured to show, the beneficial purpose of bringing the two nations into more harmonious accord.\n\nBefore describing, so far as our limited knowledge will permit, Tibet and the country lying beyond towards China, it will be advisable to give some account of our relations with the semi-independent states which are on our side of the Himalaya. First among these, both in right of its power and extent, is Nepaul, the kingdom ruled by the gallant Ghurkas, the bravest and most warlike of all the mountaineers of\nHindostan. In the question, however, under our consideration, its geographical position, lying as it does much out of the direct road for us to Tibet, makes it of less importance than the smaller territories of Sikkim and Bhutan. Nepaul stretches along the southern slopes of the Himalayas from the borders of Sikkim on the east, to the River Kalee and the neighbourhood of Kumaon on the west, or about 500 miles in all; at its greatest breadth it is only 100 miles. The greater part of the country is covered with forests, which abound with wild game, and are well known to those sportsmen who can obtain the requisite permission to shoot in them. The country is extremely mountainous, and within its confines the Himalayas attain their greatest altitude. But, on the other hand, the low lands are fertile, and the two chief towns, Khatmandoo and Ghoorka, are fine, well-populated cities. Impartial observers estimate the total population at about 2,000,000, but the native accounts place it at a much larger figure. In trade the greater portion of the energy of the community is devoted to transactions with Tibet, and intercourse, although not yet heartily cultivated, with Bengal, is now gradually being freed from restrictions of various kinds. In the earlier years of our rule in India our relations with Nepaul were not free from trouble; but latterly, owing chiefly to the friendly policy, not incompatible with the maintenance, however, of an isolated position, of the late Jung Bahadoor, the prime minister and most powerful individual in the country, our friendship has been uninterrupted. We may learn from the events that have occurred between Nepaul and China an instructive lesson, if we will. Nepaul is nominally a tributary of China, and, if we turn to history, we discover that this suzerainty has been in fact maintained down almost to the present day. If we go back to the year 1791, we find that the Ghoorkas, not content with having formed a great and powerful State on the slopes of the Himalayas, had carried their victorious arms into Tibet, and, after ravaging the intermediate country, had entered Lhasa in triumph. After imposing an indemnity of three lacs of rupees, they\nreturned with much booty besides to their own country. But a Chinese army was despatched after these invaders, and on coming up with them, overthrew them in several engagements, recovered the indemnity and much of the spoil, and successfully reasserted the right of the Pekin Emperor to homage from the rulers of Khatmandoo. The hitherto successful Ghoorkas were compelled to entreat our Government to intercede for them with the conqueror, but although Lord Cornwallis's compliance was the chief cause of their escaping without further loss, all his efforts failed to promote a friendly feeling in the breasts of the Nepalese.\n\nOnce more, so late as 1856, on the occasion of a war between Nepaul and Tibet, did the Chinese compel the former to acknowledge their suzerainty, and, at the present time, the connecting link is still maintained. After the return of the Ghoorkas from the former of these expeditions, they resumed their aggressive operations on Cis-Himalayan territory, and with such success that our own susceptibilities were aroused. On the Nepalese declining to accede to our terms, the wars of 1814-15 ensued, during which we suffered some slight reverses at the commencement; but Sir David Ochterlony, by a series of brilliant movements, compelled the enemy to sue for peace, and to restore much of his recent conquests. By the cession of Kumaon, Nepaul was reduced to its present limits. The treaty ratified in 1816 still subsists between the two countries, and the friendly spirit shown towards us by Jung Bahadur was more unequivocally demonstrated than in verbal protestations by the despatch of a Ghoorka contingent to our assistance during the Mutiny of 1857. This aid received the reward from our Government of the cession of the Terai. On his visit to this country at the time of the Great Exhibition, this sagacious ruler had doubtless formed accurate notions as to our true strength, while his personal feelings had been flattered by the f\u00eates of the great and by the cordial reception of the people. No mention of Nepaul would be adequate if nothing were said of those gallant mountaineers, who, leaving their native mountains, take service in our army, and are known as the best speci-\nmens for activity, courage and endurance of the Anglo-Indian native forces.\n\nTo the east of Nepaul is Sikhim, a narrow strip of territory, ruled nominally by a Rajah, but under British protection, and forming practically part of our dominions. Prior to the year 1814 its independence was precarious in the extreme, wedged in between its two more powerful and warlike neighbours of Nepaul and Bhutan. At the time that the aggrandization of Nepaul seemed to us menacing, we took this little State under our protection, and in 1836, in return for an annual grant of \u00a3600, the Rajah ceded to us the district round Darjeeling, where are now the pleasant settlement and tea plantations so well known to every resident in India. But the grant was declared to be forfeited in 1850, on account of some outrages perpetrated on British subjects, for which no sufficient reparation could be obtained. Besides possessing a conterminous frontier with Tibet in Sikhim, which is to all intents and purposes British territory, we have also come into direct contact with Tibet in the Chumbi Valley, recently ceded to us, and of which mention will be made further on. On this question Sikhim is, by its position, of far more importance to us than Nepaul; and among its chief recommendations, the possession of the three good passes, Kongra Lama, Donkia, and Parijong, may be mentioned. The last of these was the one used by Mr. Bogle, Captain Turner, and Mr. Manning, in their respective journeys.\n\nBhutan, or Bootan, the country of the Deb Rajah, the independent State lying still further to the east, shares with Sikhim the place of the most importance in considering our road to China through Tibet. As with Nepaul and Tibet, so with Bhutan, have our trade and general intercourse been insignificant in the extreme, and our political relations have been even more troublesome than they have been with Nepaul. In fact, to a war with Bhutan may be traced our first acquaintance with Tibet. In 1772 the mountaineers of Bhutan had been pillaging the plains of Cooch Behar, and some alarm had been caused by their\nirruption in the contiguous parts of Bengal. A small expedition was, in consequence, despatched against them by Warren Hastings. The Bhutanese were driven back to their fastnesses, routed in the battle of Chichakotta, and compelled to beg the Teshu Lama of Tibet, whose influence extended into the regions of these mountaineers, to come to their assistance. This potentate, an enlightened and kind-hearted man, so far listened to their entreaties as to send an embassy to Calcutta asking Warren Hastings to grant terms to the defeated Bhutanese. The Governor-General, anxious to conciliate his interesting neighbour, and perhaps struck by the simple-minded dignity manifested in the tone of the Teshu's letter, readily granted his request, and, at the same time, seized the favourable opportunity of sending a return mission, which he placed under the charge of Mr. George Bogle. That gentleman reached the town of Shigatze in safety, and resided some time at the great Lamasery of Teshu Lumbo; but, notwithstanding the great friendship he contracted with the Teshu Lama, all his efforts proved abortive to obtain the permission necessary for his entrance into the capital Lhasa, although that city was but a few miles distant. Possibly through apprehension of sinister intentions on the part of the English Government, possibly through jealousy of the Teshu, on the part of the all-powerful minister the Gesub Rimboche, Mr. Bogle, after many fruitless overtures to remove the official objections raised to his further progress, was compelled to return to Calcutta without attaining his chief object. He had not succeeded in reaching Lhasa, he had not seen the Dalai Lama, or his potent minister, and therefore he had not been in any way able to pave the path for future negotiation. It must not be supposed that Mr. Bogle was in any sense blameworthy for this unsatisfactory result. Like many before him, and since, he was baffled by the phlegm and stolidity of the Chinese Mandarins. I simply make this statement as showing the exact result of his\u2014the only\u2014mission to Tibet.\n\nBut to return to Bhutan, we were again compelled in 1837 to have recourse to violent measures, and as some com-\npensation for the non-payment of its tribute, we took pos-\nsession of several tracts of their low country. Once more,\nin 1865, an expedition had to be despatched against them,\nand, although the first engagements were disastrous for our\nforces, these were soon retrieved, and the war concluded with\nthe cession of the Chumbi Valley. This acquisition was most\nimportant, for it gave us a direct approach to Tibet, and\nplaced in our hands one of the first essentials towards effect-\ning intercourse with that country. It must be borne in\nmind that the Bhutanese are averse to us personally. They\nare shepherds, hunters, and warriors, and they have the\ngreat virtues of honesty and courage; but they fail to per-\nceive the advantages of commerce. Their virtues, in them-\nselves so worthy of approval, cause them to be to us a source\nof never-ending trouble. If they were less warlike, and\nmore reconciled to sedentary occupations, time might ac-\ncustom them to our habits and our empire; but as they are\ntoo brave to be cowed by threats alone, and too wedded to\na life of independence to brook without murmur its loss, we\nfind the solution of the difficulty with them not easy to be\ndiscovered. The opinion of those who are well informed\nin the matter that Bhutan must share the fate of its neigh-\nbour Assam, seems to express the course that will eventually\nhave to be adopted.\n\nHaving now discussed our relations at the present moment\nand in the past with those border states through which\ncaravans would have to pass en route for Lhasa and Western\nChina, it may be as well to say something about the passes\nthrough the great northern barrier of India. The town of\nTassisudon, the capital of Bhutan, is about 7000 feet above\nthe sea, and Parijong, on the other side of the frontier, is\nabout the same. The Parijong pass, of which we know\nmost, is available for traffic throughout the year, and pre-\nsents no serious obstacle at any period. Besides this, there\nare the Donkia and the Kongra Lama passes, which, so far\nas we know, are equally passable at all times. There are\nnumerous others along the whole border. It is beyond dis-\npute that there is no such formidable country in this direc-\ntion as that passed through by the Yarkand Embassy north of Kashmir. Both Mr. Bogle and Mr. Manning travelled late in the year, but the inconvenience they suffered seems trivial to those accustomed to journeys in elevated regions. The pundits, who have recently been employed by the geographical department of the India Office in making explorations, have thrown considerable light on the topography of Tibet and Nepal, but it cannot be disputed that much still remains to be done in this direction. It is safe to assert, however, that the roads to Tibet present no insuperable difficulties. Our best road to Tibet lies undoubtedly through Sikkim and Bhutan; but it is quite possible that greater experience may prove that the most advantageous route of all to China lies through Assam, and across the extreme edge of the Himalayas. This route, if found to be practicable, offers the shortest and most direct highway to China. While the distance from Lhasa to Singan-foo is 1100 miles, Rungpoor is only 800 from Mahou-foo, on the Yangtze, whence that river is navigable to its mouth.\n\nThe following table of the chief passes may prove useful. In Bhutan we have no definite information as to any practicable passes. Pemberton says that those by the Monass River are probably the least difficult. In considering these altitudes we must remember that the snow-line is exceptionally high, being about 14000 feet south and 16000 feet north of the range. A striking instance of the mildness of the atmosphere is seen in the fact that Sir Joseph Hooker found roses growing in the valleys at almost 13000 feet above the sea; and in the Tibetan table-land corn is sown at still loftier altitudes.\n\n| Pass | Altitude |\n|------|----------|\n| Jelup | Nearly 16000 ft. |\n| Parjung | Between Sikkim and Bhutan |\n| Kongru Lama | \" 16000 ft. |\n| Dangola | \" 15700 ft. |\n| Dangola | \" 17500 ft. |\n| Sikkim | \" 17000 ft. |\n| Tunkra | \" 17500 ft. |\n| Tankrula | \" 16000 ft. |\n| Jelpa | \" 10200 ft. |\n| Jelpa | Leading to |\n| Takla | \" 13000 ft. |\n| Chum | \" 14000 ft. |\n| Chum | Chumbi Valley |\n| Laguwaingla | Nepal |\n| Laguwaingla | \" 15000 ft. |\n| Laguwaingla | \" 16000 ft. |\nThe last-named place is the most important of all the Nepalese towns, and a very considerable amount of merchandise passes through it throughout the year.\n\nSince the late Mr. Joseph Warren, Tibet was left unvisited by English enterprise for a number of years, and the region might have been mistakenly pronounced but for the energy and daring of Thomas Manning. Mr. Clements Markham has in a recent work recounted the names of these two almost forgotten explorers, and has, besides, given us a most instructive and interesting account of the country, a work at least that we wish for accurate information about Tibet.\n\nWhile Warren's journeys and Mr. Bogle simply aimed at obtaining friendship with Tibet, Mr. Manning only turned his eyes to the hitherto in order to obtain admission into the interior of China. During several years' residence at Lhasa he had kept his face prominently before him, but in his attempts to induce the local mandarins to accede to his wishes, and at his stratagems to elude their vigilance, he varied unavailing. Despairing at last of success from Lhasa, he resolved nothing thwarted in his purpose, to secure information from a totally different quarter. He came unexpectedly to Calcutta, and, crossing the Himalaya in a private mission, without any Government mission, and as his personal chaplain, entered Tibet in the year 1811. Manning owed to his acquaintance with the Chinese language and customs, he visited alone, and without any safeguard, the mysterious regions of Tibet. That he succeeded in reaching Lhasa; that he was also permitted to reside there for a considerable time, during which he acquired a great reputation among the people by his skill as a physician; that he was received in audience by the Dalai Lama, of\nwhom he has left, in the fragments of his journal, a most vivid description; are facts which best show the merit of this most courageous gentleman. Had his papers not been lost at sea some years later, he would undoubtedly have left us the most important information on this interesting country. But even he was unable to accomplish his chief object, that of entering China, and, after much useless negotiation, he was obliged to give up his design and return to India. Since then the French missionaries, Hue and Gabet, have seen the Dalai Lama and have resided in Lhasa. They share with Mr. Manning the honour of being the only Europeans who have beheld that distinguished and saint-like personage.\n\nTibet is called Tsang by the Chinese, and is said to be extremely rich in minerals, although it is certainly poor as a vegetable-producing country. Among its chief recommendations Mr. Manning mentions that \"excellent mutton can be obtained daily.\" To the intelligent observer the people present many features of interest. They are a simple-minded, honest, quiet people; yet they possess a fairer share of courage than most Asiatics. With a decided preference for an uneventful, safe, monotonous sort of existence, they are still not afraid to fight in defence of their belongings. Like most civilized people, they are grateful if the occasion does not arise. They are far from being cruel in their disposition, they are clean, for Asiatics, in their person, and they live one among the other in a homely way without unnecessary quarrelling. They obey the edicts issued from Pekin, they contribute their quota to the Imperial expenditure, and they respect the mandarin at the head of the military stationed in each town. This official, as a rule, does not abuse his power, and confines himself to his own province, leaving the people to jog along in their own quiet fashion in accordance with the precepts and examples of their lamas. It has been computed that there are 60,000 Chinese troops stationed in Tibet, but I confess that this seems to me an exaggerated figure; indeed, it is most probable that not more than 10,000 are required as a permanent guard for the frontier. A large trade is carried on\nwith China, and, while most of the merchants only go as far as Sining-fu, there are some who proceed to Hankow and Pekin. There is a good main road along the Tibetan table-land to the first of these places, whence the network of roads, for which China is justly famous, branches out in all directions. But during the winter months the weather here is terribly severe, and the roads are simply impassable. The Yeshu Lama of Mr. Bagie's time, some years after the departure of our representative, received an invitation from the Emperor to proceed to Pekin, and being caught by winter in the exposed plateau north of Lhasa, was compelled to halt for three months on his journey until the return of spring once more made the roads in a fit state for travelling. There is, therefore, no easy road even in this direction to China, and it must clearly be understood, that although good roads and security to life and property exist in Northern Tibet, during the winter months all intercourse will have to cease. This route must therefore be labelled \"during fine weather only.\" There is fortunately good reason for supposing that trade and intercourse with Southern Tibet are not affected by the same objection. The direct access that, even by this way, would be obtained with some of the least known and reputedly richest of Chinese provinces during many months of the year, could not fail to produce great results, and quite apart from the question of commercial success that should be attained, the commencement of political and general relations with Tibet might with some justice be termed the most interesting event that had taken place in Asia for some time. In Tibet may not only be found the key of Chinese history and institutions, but also evidence of many kinds throwing light on matters that have been puzzling to the antiquaries and historical students of our own Eastern possessions. I may be permitted to call attention to the description of Tibet from the pen of Father John Francis, given in an Appendix to Mr. Clements Markham's work. For, taken as a whole, it is one of the most instructive volumes of that country. It is possible that it may have suffered the fate that usually befalls all matter\nconsigned to an Appendix, and been overlooked. No one can arise from a perusal of any of the works mentioned, or indeed from any other on Tibet, without experiencing an increase of respect for the Chinese. We cannot help acknowledging that their political system must be based on a foundation of true justice, since they have been able to govern Tibet for centuries with lenience and without difficulty. If they have been strict in maintaining order, they have at the same time tolerated the prejudices and customs of their subjects. They have indeed included them in the Chinese empire, but they have made the connecting link one of affection and mutual respect. We have a not less striking instance of the immense prestige of the Chinese Government in the fact that it has, in recent years, been able to assert its suzerainty over such far-distant tributaries as Nepaul and Bhutan. If we contrast with its weight and influence in these states our own, which are so near to them, and under whose direct influence they exist, we shall find not only food for cogitation, but real cause for admiration of the Chinese. The country that can exercise so wide a charm and fascination must needs possess some merits of a supreme degree. If the assertion of this will impress on some of us a greater respect for the Chinese, and if the study of their rule in Tibet will make us appreciate the fact that the Chinese are not to be set down as mere Asiatics, we shall have done something on our side, it might be said something of our duty, towards effecting a permanent reconciliation between the two peoples. Those who care to devote some of their leisure to the study of Tibet will find even in the meagre literature at their disposal much to interest, instruct, and improve them.\n\nIt is impossible to consider this question without taking into consideration another power besides the two directly concerned; it is impossible to follow out this proposition of an embassy to Lhasa to its logical conclusion, intercourse by land with China, without having the Russian empire brought into the argument. Russia's intercourse by land with China dates back to the days of Peter the Great. She has always been\ntreated as the footing of the most friendly nation; but, during the last ten or fifteen years, her efforts to force merchandise and friendship on the Chinese have been more persistent. While our trade has taken the roundabout line of the Straits of Malacca, Russia's has passed through the rising town of Urga to Pekin. Alarmists may be frightened at the idea of our crossing our natural frontier in pursuit of a trade stimulus, and entering upon an undertaking which might create fresh rivalry between Russia and this country. It may be sufficient answer to such persons to point out that however our routes lie the vast and impassable desert of Sinkiang. While our road would bring us into some of the richest of the provinces of the Chinese Empire, hers enters the same empire under less favourable circumstances, many hundreds of miles to the north. The encounter must take place, therefore, if anywhere, in the heart of China, in the streets of Pekin or the bazaars of Hankow; just as at the present day Europeans and Americans keenly dispute with us, and assert our right to precedence, in Shanghai and Foochow. There is not much risk, therefore, from our seeming to enter into a fresh contest by opening up land communication with Tibet and China, with a nation with which we have already sufficiently numerous points in dispute, like Russia. Undoubtedly our merchandise will be placed on a more equal footing with that of Russia, and the consequence will be that, if our goods are cheaper and better, Russian merchants will suffer from the competition, and perhaps the Government will be compelled by sheer necessity, to give up the restrictive commercial policy followed with such rigour throughout the whole of Asia. This may all occur, but, under any circumstances it must take place some day or other, and the chief person benefited by it will be the Chinaman. We must regard in this case simply our own interests and our mission with China. We of course wish naturally to promote the former, and we are now desirous of cementing the latter. The chief purport of this paper is to show that the utmost precaution against misunderstanding is to be sought in an increase of mutual knowledge, brought to pass\nby legitimate means. We have obtained from China a concession, of which it will cost but little to test the practical value. Even if the result should prove disappointing, which would be very surprising, a mission to Lhasa would not occasion much outlay. If we could obtain the right to have a resident agent there, it would be additionally advantageous. Judiciously selected presents for the Dalai Lama and his minister might produce great results, and with tact on the part of our representative, who should, above all things, possess intimate acquaintance with Chinese etiquette, all would probably proceed satisfactorily. It might be wise not to arouse susceptibilities, which we know are tender, by attempting too much, and therefore it would be preferable to remain contented with intercourse with Tibet alone, for some time, until the more extended arrangement with China might at length take place, imperceptibly and as a natural sequence. Whatever our Indian and Foreign Offices may determine on, whether they confine their decision to a mission of amity to Lhasa, or to a fresh embassy to Pekin, via Tibet, the evils of delay must be impressed upon them both. If we are really to attempt to resume negotiations with Tibet, if we are to make some provision for perpetuating good feelings in the future between China and England, we must not refuse to avail ourselves of the advantages of our position, or of those secured for us so recently by Sir Thomas Wade. We must, if we are not to sink once more in the estimation of the Celestials, by a little well-timed action, keep the fact prominently before them of our presence in Asia as a great power. In Asia we must speak and act as the Emperors of India.\n\nTo sum up briefly on the question. The difficulty in reaching Tibet is no insuperable obstacle; the route beyond is safe, and, probably, also, easy during nine certain months; the prospects of commercial success seem satisfactory; there is little danger of political complications arising; and there is no risk whatever of our being induced to add to our dominions. If successful, it will not only serve to form amicable relations with a new and highly-interesting country.\nbut it may also tend to increase those at present existing between England and China. In a political point of view it will also strengthen our hands immeasurably, for on the sea-coast we must always meet rivals in other civilized nations, here we should be alone. The prospect, I think, must be admitted to be very promising, and only requires a little vigour, to be put out of the realms of possibility into those of fact. Our rulers must, indeed, first show the way, but the conclusion of the matter rests only with ourselves.\nART. VI.\u2014Notes and Recollections on Tea Cultivation in Kumaon and Garhwal. By J. H. Batten, F.R.G.S., Bengal Civil Service Retired, formerly Commissioner of Kumaon.\n\nThe cultivation of Tea in Kumaon has become so important and profitable, that it is interesting to trace the early history of this industry; and the duty of placing on record as true an account as possible of its introduction, rise and progress, is one which ought not to be neglected by those who are acquainted with the real facts; yet, after all, there is not very much to be told, even by those in full possession of all the data, when they show that, in this case\u2014belonging, as it does, in an especial manner, to the best interests of British India\u2014the seed of the sower \"fell upon good ground, and yielded fruit, some an hundred-fold, some sixty, some thirty.\"\n\nIts history, however, may be conveniently and naturally divided into periods, comprising the seasons, first, of ignorance and indifference; secondly, of guessing and conjecture; thirdly, of the first actual official experiment; fourthly, of regular government exploitation; fifthly, of the commencement and progress of private enterprise; sixthly, of the abandonment of the official experiment; and lastly, of the commercially successful result. My own recollections more particularly belong to the first four periods.\n\nWith regard to the first period, I am not surprised that the Tea plant, as a source of future wealth to the British Himalayan provinces, did not enter into the anticipations of the early administrators of these districts, when I find even the climate, now their chief attraction, was treated with indifference. It is a fact that when Mr. G. W. Traill, then an Assistant under the Resident of Delhi, was first offered the appointment of Commissioner of Kumaon in succession\n\n* The substance of this paper was read at the Meeting of the British Association at Plymouth, August, 1877.\nSince the annexation of Garhwal in 1815, the British Resident afterwards our Resident in Garhwal has been engaged on the score of the hills which he might have the option of purchasing or selling. In case the hills should be purchased by the Government, if I may not lay too much stress on this particular circumstance, I am unwilling to make any but those in his statistical report. Mr. Macdonald's \"Asiatic Journal\" shows the same experience of the hills as far as they belong generally, to the diversities of climate, which result in various degrees of healthfulness, and for public information, such as the range (as indicated) of observations made in the hills, as well as below the sea. Almorah, which is said to be the highest of the hills, is considered as the only Sanatorium in the D\u00fcn of that region. The north-western mountains, which are sub-tropical climates, are the headquarters of the hills, and not as yet the importance of their \"Sanatorium\" at Mussoorie, or \"Sanatorium\" at Simla.\n\nCan I be accused of what might perhaps be thought to the following summer seat of the British Provinces, was only discovered as a Sanatorium Station in 1843-44;\nthat R\u00e1nikhet, now a large European Military Cantonment, reached by a carriage road from the plains, was only known, until very recently, as forming part of the Choumoka Devi range, visited by Bishop Heber in December, 1824, and especially admired by him on account of its magnificent prospects of the Snowy Peaks; that the much-dreaded malarious Bh\u00e1bar and Terai, at the foot of the Kumaon mountains, formed a real and actual barrier to all intercourse, except by letter post, from April to November, while they are now constantly traversed, in comparative safety, by European travellers, and afford a principal source of revenue to the Kumaon exchequer, under the able management of Sir Henry Ramsay, the present Commissioner; that the resort of English men, women and children to the mountains, formerly feared as somewhat of an invasion and visitation, has become a constantly increasing source of wealth and civilization to the \"poor Pah\u00e1ris\"; and, lastly, that, at the present date, the price of borax from Hundes, in the Almorah Bazaar, has almost ceased to be mentioned as a trade speculation, while the price of Almorah Tea has become an important topic of conversation among the merchants of K\u00e1b\u00fal!\n\nAs these notes are specially devoted to the subject of Tea in Kumaon and Garhw\u00e1l, I need not concern myself with the general speculations as to the growth of the Tea plant throughout the Himalayan districts, or elsewhere, which the valuable paper on Tea culture read before the Society of Arts, by Mr. A. Burrell, on February 2nd, 1877, has fairly exhausted. But I may be permitted to remark that, looking to botanical facts, which show no true Thea or Camellia growing wild in the mountains west of Sikkim, it is highly probable that the specimens of Thea sent from Nip\u00e1l in 1818 to Dr. Wallich, then the Superintendent of the Botanical Garden at Calcutta, by the Hon. Edward Gardner, belonged to Chinese plants, flourishing in the residency or other gardens at Khatmandu\u2014an introduction nowise extraordinary, considering the political relations existing between China and Nip\u00e1l. I may also observe that the traveller\nMoorcroft, whose deputation to Kashmir and Tibet took place in 1819, and whose special business was to look after horses and wool, when mentioning the \"Tea of Bissahir\" and comparing it with the \"coarser Teas of China,\" fell into the mistake of supposing that the Tea plant grew naturally on the banks of the Sutlej.\n\nBishop Heber, who visited Almorah in December, 1824, and, as previously glanced at, on his return tour to the plains, passed the site of the present cantonment of Ranikhet by the route of the Ri\u00fani, K\u00famhp\u00far and Chaum\u00faka D\u00e9v\u00ed range, wrote the following words in his journal: \"The Tea plant grows wild all through Kumaon, but cannot be made use of, from an emetic quality which it possesses. This perhaps might be remedied by cultivation, but the experiment has never been tried. For the cultivation of Tea I should apprehend both the soil, hilly surface and climate of Kumaon, in all which it resembles the Tea provinces of China, extremely favourable.\"\n\nThis latter remark shows the observant eye, and prophetical wisdom of the good Bishop, and fully entitles him to an honourable place, perhaps the first, on the list of Tea pioneers of Kumaon, but the former statement was founded on a \"vulgar error.\" It is now well known that the plant alluded to is a species of Osyris, belonging to the natural order Santalaceae, and it is as well to record, in this place, that, in the Transactions of the Committee of Commerce and Agriculture of the Royal Asiatic Society of London for 1838, Dr. Royle states that \"some specimens of the Tea Bishop Heber referred to had been obtained by the Hon. Mr. Shore, from Mr. Traill, then Commissioner in Kumaon, and were found to be the dried leaves of Osyris Nepalensis, and produced a very disagreeably tasted nauseous infusion when used as Tea.\"\n\nThe indigenous Tea, therefore, of Kumaon must,\n\n---\n\n1 As bearing on my present subject, it is somewhat singular that the principal site, originally selected for this military station, was a Tea-garden belonging to the Troup family, the members of which have been, from the first, conspicuous private Tea-growers in Kumaon.\n\n2 The late Captain Edward Madden, Bengal Artillery, subsequently better known, under the name of Major Madden, as the author of numerous highly interesting botanical and other notes of his tours in the Himalayan districts, and\nI fear, take its place, in spite of episcopal authority, among the rosemary and nettle and other teas of our rural English housewives. Before closing this subject, I may add that the nearest ally to Thea in Kumaon is a species of *Eurya*, belonging to the same natural family, the \"Ternstr\u00f6miaeae,\" but undoubtedly not the Tea-plant.\n\nAmidst all these guesses and conjectures, the first real land which we descry in the history of Kumaon Tea is the appointment, on 24th January, 1834, of Lord William Bentinck's \"Committee for the purpose of submitting a plan for the accomplishment of the introduction of Tea culture in India, and for the superintendence of its execution.\" This Committee circulated important queries, and, among the botanists and scientific men aroused by the inquiry, there happily appeared Dr. Hugh Falconer, Civil Surgeon of Saharanpur, in the North-West Provinces, then in charge of the Government Botanical Gardens at that station, and, eventually, the successor of Dr. Royle in that appointment. His ardent mind was at once aroused to the great importance of the subject as affecting the Himalayan districts which overhung the scene of his official labours.\n\nmore particularly in Kumaon, published in the Journal of the Bengal Asiatic Society, in the years 1847-48-49, written thus in his \"Brief Observations on some of the Finer and Conspicuous Trees of the Himalaya,\" printed in vol. iv of the Journal of the Agricultural and Horticultural Society of India at Calcutta (1846). Dr. Royle mentions that in Kumaon Tea is made from the leaves of the shrub *Oxalis nepalensis*, and this is probably the Green Tea of Bishar which Moncros (Travels, i. 35, 2) describes as being imported into Lahoul under the name of *Mann or Bishar Tea*, the produce of an evergreen shrub, 4 ft high, growing on a dry soil in Kumaon, and Bishar on the banks of the Sutlej, and especially about Shajul and near Rampur. The leaves are gathered in June and July, to November, and after infusion in hot water are rubbed and dried in the sun. They sell at the rate of three seers per rupee and are not much in request. The first infusion is reddish and is reckoned leastly, the second, which is used, is yellowish green. The *Oxalis nepalensis* grows to be a large shrub ten or twelve feet high in the Kolar Hills above Subathoo and between Kausawar and Kalika, where it is called Kromontes, Koomotes, and Kumerotes, and also Loomot. The fruit is known by the name of Popot or Pupu, its applied to the root of *Murraya koenigii* and is said to use the same properties as the root and is called Tea. The Black Tea of Bishar, Moncros describes as the produce of a deciduous shrub found near Pising and Lechlen in Kumaon, of which the leaves are picked in July and August. Pising is very elevated, for a species of *Rhabdanthus* flourishes in the neighbourhood.\n\n1 In Major Munro's Kumaon Botany *Eurya seminata* is mentioned more than once. In a recent work \"The Karens of the Golden Chersonese,\" by Lieut.-Col. A. E. Macdonald, the Burmese species of *Eurya* is frequently mentioned as \"wild tea.\"\nThe mantle of Royle had indeed fallen on worthy shoulders. If to that eminent naturalist at Sah\u00e1ranp\u00far and to Wallich at Calcutta, who were ever presenting reports and urging arguments in the proper quarter between 1827 and 1834, we owe that formation of the Tea Committee in the latter year I have just named as the era from which to count our Indian Tea chronology, it is to Falconer that the Kumaon and Garhw\u00e1l Tea growers may undoubtedly look back as the founder of their history. I well remember, on arriving at Sah\u00e1ranp\u00far in January, 1835, my own delight at my first introduction to this eager and enthusiastic votary of science. At that time, of course, the treasures of the Sew\u00e1lik fossil ground were for the first time displayed to my admiring eyes, and Cautley, Durand and Baker, officers belonging to the Jumna Canals, were joined with Falconer in the enlightened circle\\(^1\\) belonging to that small, but interesting station, and its neighbour D\u00e1d\u00fap\u00far; geology, however, was far from being the sole topic of animated discussion, and Falconer was full of his recent visit to the mountain country between the heads of the Jumna and Ganges, and of his hopes of permanently introducing the true Tea plant not only there and in the Dehra D\u00fan, but, also, in the district between the Ganges and Gogra, forming the British Province of Kumaon. My own earliest lessons in Him\u00e1layan Botany and Geology were there taught me in Falconer's happiest manner, and the sight again of his MS. Journal, then shown to me, with which I have been recently favoured, brings my thoughts vividly back to those instructive days, and sadly reminds me that, in 1834, as in following times, and alas! to the very end, frequent attacks of illness cut short, or diminished the extent and usefulness of, his most important tours of scientific inquiry. Much of the ground traversed and described in that Journal of 1834 was gone over by me in 1835; and,\n\n\\(^1\\) The future world-wide distinction of this circle was not confined to Canal Officers and men of natural science; for, the late Commander-in-Chief in India, Lord Napier of Magdala, then a young Lieutenant, was Civil Executive Engineer at Sah\u00e1ranp\u00far. Dr. John Muir, the well-known Oriental scholar, soon after the period of which I am speaking, joined this circle as one of the Revenue functionaries of the district.\nknowing the anxiety of my friend in the subject, I well recollect my disappointment in finding that, at one garden\u2014R\u0101ma Surai,1 in the heart of the T\u012brhi Rajah's territory\u2014the Tea seeds sown by the Sah\u0101ranp\u016br gardener had not yet successfully germinated.\n\nTo return to the Tea Committee. The Report2 received by that body in 1834, from Dr. Falconer, is acknowledged as having led them to adopt the Sub-Himalayan regions3 as entirely suitable for the projected culture; and so rapidly was this followed up by action, that their deputies secretary, Mr. Gordon, was able to send to them from China a large supply of seeds of the true Bohea tea, which, early in 1835, besides being despatched to Madras, Mysore, the Nilgherries, and Assam, were distributed, also, in foreign Garhw\u0101l (T\u012brhi), the Dehra D\u016bn, Sirm\u016br, and Kumaon.\n\nIt was extremely fortunate for the cause of which I am treating that the Commissioner of Kumaon, in 1834, was Mr. George William Traill. This gentleman, as shown by his published statistical reports on Kumaon and the Bho\u1e6de Mehals, and by his great reputation as a Local Administrator, was eminently qualified to appreciate the economical importance of the Tea question; and to give effect to any suggestions of the Tea Committee. It was also fortunate that he possessed on the spot an able coadjutor in Mr. Robert Blinkworth,4 who held, at Almorah, under Dr. Wallisch, as he had previously held in Nipal, the appointment of Plant Collector for the Botanical Garden of Calcutta. On receiving the report of the Tea Committee, Mr. Traill at once understood the conditions under which the Chinese Tea plant would be most likely to flourish in his province; and he selected two most appropriate sites for sowing the Tea Committee's seeds. All subsequent experience has shown that, as a general rule, he was quite right in the grounds of his selections\u2014climatic and\n\n---\n\n1 Subsequently one of the most favourable, though small, sites of Tea, as reported by Dr. Johnson, in July, 1847.\n2 22nd February, 1834.\n3 That is, \"the lower hills and valleys of the Himalayan range.\"\n4 A name not unknown to the nomenclature of the Himalayan flora.\notherwise.\u2014while any serious departure from those grounds has been subsequently found to be unfavourable to the success of the tea experiment. These sites he selected were Lachinawar, near Almora, and Bhartpur, near Bhimtal, the former occupying three acres of old and easily acquired crown garden land on the north-west slope of the hill below the capital town, at 4,100 feet above the sea, the latter occupying four acres at 4,500 feet above the sea, in the near neighbourhood of the Bhimtal Lake, which is situated on the first step of the mountains above the Bhamauri Pass. In these two sites the Kumaon official experiment was continued during the six quiet years following the eventful period of 1834-35. The close of 1835 witnessed the departure to Europe of Mr. G. W. Traill, the Commissioner to whom the province of Kumaon owes so much. \"His name will live for ever among the posterities,\" the descendants of those grateful Paharias, in whose memory their earliest British ruler has been associated with the blessings of peace, kind dealing and good government; blessings unknown under the hard rule of the Gurkhas, if not with that increase of wealth and civilization, moral and material, which, with the advance of the times, has marked the administration of his successors.\n\nIt is proper to confess that, at Lachinawar and Bhartpur, the growth of the tea plants was left very much to Providence and Mr. Hindworth; and that no very sanguine anticipations or serious inspections disturbed the tranquillity of the Kumaon authorities with regard to tea. It was seen, in course of time, evidence that the plants flourished in these new situations; and perhaps, the first favourable cir-\n\nBy Mr.\u2014\n\nMr. Hind was a member of the well-known Orkney family, and possessed both energy of mind and body, but he preferred to lead a quiet life among old friends in London, and died suddenly at the Oriental Club in November,\n\nMr. J. H. Batten, B.C.S., formerly Assistant Commissioner, 1839 to 1848, Mr. J. H. Batten, B.C.S., formerly Assistant Commissioner, 1839 to 1848, the present Major-General the Honourable Mr. J. H. Batten, B.C.S., formerly Assistant Commissioner.\ncircumstance connected with them and their produce was, that many travellers through the Province had opportunities of observing the tall, flower-covered, and seed-laden tea trees growing in Mr. George Lushington's garden, at his beautiful country residence of Ritea Sen, at Soniana, in Lohba, 50 miles to the north-west of Almorah, on the borders of Kumaon and Garhw\u0101l. Similarly, visitors to the Saharanpur Botanical Garden were shown live tea tree plants, the offspring of seeds from the small patch of nursery ground at Koth, in foreign Garhw\u0101l.\n\nAt Paori, too, the official residence\u2014it can hardly be called the \"civil station\"\u2014of the Senior Assistant Commissioner in charge of the British portion of Garhw\u0101l, situated on the north side of the range overhanging the old capital Srinagpur\u2014very fine tea plants were growing in considerable numbers. At length, in the spring of 1841, Dr. Falconer himself paid a visit to Kumaon, and the regular formation of the Kapina nursery at Almorah, which Mr. Blinkworth had selected, in the immediate vicinity of Latchmewar, and, like that plantation, having its nucleus in an old Crown-plot of garden, was the first result of his personal inspection of the country. I well remember his hearty approval of the wisdom which had led Mr. Traill and Mr. Blinkworth to select the original tea sites; but it is right to state that Falconer, quite as much as his successor, Dr. W. Jameson, at first strongly desiderated tea sites in more flat, and more easily and plentifully irrigated and irrigatable land.\n\nThe extension of the official experiment to the rich slopes adjacent to Naukurchin Tal, the sister lake of Bhimtal, not far from the Bharatpur plantation, followed in rapid course; and early in 1842 the Government was able to send to the Calcutta Agricultural and Horticultural Society the following cheering notices, supplied by Falconer, respecting the progress already made in the cultivation of the Tea plant in the Provinces of Kumaon and Garhw\u0101l.\n\n\"The first place in which the plant may be seen is Paori,\n\n1 Now a tea plantation belonging to Mr. J. Richards.\nnear Sreenuggur, at the elevation of about 6,000 feet,\\(^1\\) where there are some hundred strong and healthy-looking plants and seedlings. The next place is in a garden at Lobah; here, at a height of about 5,000 feet, are about as many plants as at Paori, and all of the same healthy appearance. At Almorah there are two gardens belonging to Government; the first covers three acres, and contains 1,500 full-grown trees yielding seed, and 20,000 growing seedlings. The second stands on eleven and a half acres, and has 700 layers and 500 seedlings. The most eligible site nearest the plains is at Bheemtal, where there are two gardens; Bhartpoor, of three acres, contains 300 trees yielding seed, 700 layers, and 200 seedlings; the other, Russeah, on the Nowkoorcha Lake, of six acres, has 5,846 thriving seedlings, and 20,000 seeds sown. In the vicinity of this last garden, in the semi-circular slope of the mountain to the north and east of the Nowkoorcha Lake, a great extent of irrigatable land, proved to be favourable to the growth of the tea-plant, is to be had at the distance of only one march from the plains, and at an average elevation of about 4,000 feet. In the several gardens, not of too recent formation to have trees yielding seed, there are calculated to be not less than 50,000 seeds nearly ready to be gathered, and that nearly all of these will germinate may be concluded from the produce of what have last year been sown, and are now coming up. On the whole, the experiment, in as far as the possibility of rearing the tea-plant in the provinces of Gurhwal and Kumaon is in question, may be safely pronounced to have completely succeeded.\\(^2\\)\n\nThis quotation brings us naturally to the close of our period of *first official experiment*, and we now enter upon the period of *regular Government exploitation*\\(^2\\)\u2014and, at this point\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This elevation is not correct. The height of Paori itself is not quite 5,250 ft. The tea nurseries at Chopra and Gudolee, in its neighbourhood, were subsequently established at elevations extending from 5,000 to near 6,000 feet above the sea.\n\n\\(^2\\) Dr. Falconer, on 2nd May, 1836, forwarded to the Secretary of the Tea Committee, at Calcutta, a *very full* Report on the sites of the Five Experimental Tea Nurseries which he had established in Gurhwal (Protected State) and Sirmur\nof time, the figure of Hugh Falconer begins to recede from our view. But before ill-health compelled him to leave Saharanpur, in December, 1842, he had accomplished the main object which he had always in view, and proved the success of the experiment which had been initiated under his auspices, by the production of actual manufactured Himalayan Tea. He had concluded his Report on the state of affairs in Kumaon, at the close of 1841, by the following recommendation:\n\n\"I beg, therefore, strongly to recommend this to the favourable consideration of Government, that two complete sets of Chinese Tea manufacturers be supplied for the nurseries at Kumaon and Garhwal, especial care being taken, in the selection, that these workmen be of the best description.\"\n\nIn consequence of that application,\u00b9 \"The Indian Government determined upon sending him a small manufacturing establishment. The black and green tea manufacturers however, who were engaged for this purpose by the Commissioner of Assam, subsequently declined, together with their Superintendent, to proceed to Kumaon. Dr. Wallich was fortunately enabled to procure other men in Calcutta out of a party of Chinese artisans returned from Assam. A set of manufacturing implements were also procured from Assam. These were forwarded to Kumaon in charge of Mr. Milner, the gardener, who was on his way to the Botanic Garden at Saharanpur. The Chinamen (nine in number) arrived at their destination\u00b2 in April, 1842.\"\n\nThese men made some tea from the Kumaon plants in the autumn of that year, and Dr. Falconer, who had been detained in the South of Europe by ill-health, brought a specimen of the manufacture to England in June, 1843. As shown in Dr. Royle's report just quoted, it was submitted\n\n\u00b9 Protected State, and on the condition of the Tea seeds which he had received from Calcutta. I am especially indebted to Mr. Burwell for the use of Dr. Falconer's original Diary and other MSS., and of this first Tea Report, never published, which Mr. Burwell found in the Records of the India Office, and has permission to print.\n\n\u00b2 Memoir on the Progress of the China Tea Plant in the Himalayas, from 1835 to 1847, by J. Forbes Royle, M.D., F.R.S., London, April, 1849. Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Vol. XII. Part I.\n\n\u00b3 Hawalibagh, near Amorah.\nfor examination to the eminent tea-brokers, Messrs. Ewart, MacCaughy, and Delafosse, and their report of 8th September, 1843, is thus worded:\u2014\"The tea brought by Dr. Falconer as a specimen of the growth of the China plant in the Himalayan Mountains resembles most nearly the description occasionally imported from China under the name of Oolong. This resemblance is observable in the appearance of the leaf before and after infusion. The colour of the liquor is also similar, being paler, and more of the straw colour than the general description of black tea. It is not so high flavoured as the fine Oolong tea with which we have compared it, and has been too highly burnt in the preparation; but it is of a delicate, fine flavour, and would command a ready sale here.\" I myself well remember the arrival of the Chinamen; and in my printed account of Almorah, in June, 1843, where I described the beauty of the scenery at Hawalbagh, and recorded the fact that Major Corbett's large estate at that place had been purchased by Government, with my hopes that, under the superintendence of Dr. Jameson, the horticultural garden would yield large supplies of fruit, such as apples, pears, and plums, of better quality than then existed, I added, \"Thousands of Tea plants are thriving very well in the Almorah and Hawulbagh nurseries, and ten Chinese Tea-bakers amuse the puharree population by their strange figures, and still stranger propensities.\"\n\nIt is no disparagement of Falconer's merit that it was subsequently discovered that these first imported artizans were not all of the right sort from the best Tea districts of China, or that Dr. Jameson, who had relieved Falconer during the serious illness of the latter, had, as it would appear, also sent specimens of manufactured Tea to Calcutta and London, and received a favourable report thereon in September, 1843, from Messrs. Thomson, of Mincing Lane.\n\nWe now come to the great central name which will always most justly be associated with the immense success which has attended the progress of Tea culture in the mountain\n\n1 Among them their love of pork.\ndistricts of India. William Jameson had not to make a name for himself. He came to India with all the prestige derived from the reputation in science of his celebrated uncle, and right nobly did he sustain and extend from Edinburgh and Europe to the Himalaya and Asia, the honours of his family.\n\nHaving assumed full management everywhere as Superintendent, Dr. Jameson paid his first visit to Kumaon, in April, 1843; and made his first official Report on the Tea Nurseries of that Province, on the 28th February, 1844. From that date until the final abandonment of the Government exploitation, and the successful establishment of private enterprizes, the progress of the whole cultivation of the Tea plant, and of the production and disposal of the manufactured Tea, formed the subject of the most complete and exhaustive reports, furnished regularly by the Superintendent, and published at first in the \"Transactions of the Calcutta Agricultural and Horticultural Society,\" and, after the introduction of the system of Annual Administration Reports by the several Governments of British India, in the official records of the N.W. Provinces. It is not necessary for me to transfer the statistical details thus furnished to the pages of these Notes and Recollections. I trust that they will be collected and embodied in one general history, either by Dr. Jameson himself, or by some other competent authority. But the following observations, founded on personal experience connected with the earlier reports, will not, I humbly think, be out of place.\n\nWith the exception of the garden at Huwalbagh, which, with its fine house and offices, were purchased by Government at a most convenient and critical period in the history of the experiment of which we are treating, and which became the head-quarters of Dr. Jameson in Kumaon, and the site of the principal factory\u2014the new ground taken up for the first great extension of the Tea nurseries was not all\n\n---\n\n1 Communicated by Government N.W. Provinces to the Agricultural and Horticultural Society, Calcutta, and published in their Journal, vol. ii. no. iii.\nhappily chosen. At that time, a copious supply of water for irrigation of the Tea plants was considered essential to their welfare, and Dr. Jameson, in his additions to the original plantations in the Bhimt\u00e1l district, only carried out the selections and intentions of his predecessor. Russeah, Kooa Sar, and Anoo Sar, especially these last, as their names imply, were situated in essentially valley land. The natives of Kumaon divide all land into ooperaon, or high, and tulaon, or low, which last division also includes seera, or actually wet or irrigated soil; and the original recommendations of the Tea Committee certainly did not point to the latter. But these nurseries also had another defect. They for the most part occupied land which the villagers of the Chukh\u00e1ta district preferred to keep in their own occupation, and official pressure was undoubtedly used, before the landowners agreed to take what was considered a compensating rate of rent.\n\nI, myself, at that time, filled a subordinate position, and, in handing over wheat and rice lands for the planting of Tea, only acted under the orders of superior authority. But nevertheless, in my civil executive capacity, my hands, as duly recorded by Dr. Jameson, dealt the fatal blow, and I do not now wish to deny my responsibility; but the whole thing was a mistake, and some time before I resigned the Commissionership to its present philanthropic incumbent, having been instant, in season and out of season, in personally representing to the head of the local Government the claims and wishes of the Zemindars, I had the great satisfaction of restoring them their lands, and receiving their thanks. On this matter Mr. Robert Fortune, the celebrated gardener-traveller, to whom English florists owe so much, in his first report on the condition and prospects of Tea cultivation in the North-West Provinces, dated September 6th, 1851, after objecting to the \"low flat land\" as unsuitable for Tea, remarked, \"Besides, such lands are valuable for other purposes. They are excellent rice lands, and, as such, of considerable value to the natives.\" And in his second report, in 1856, he made the following observation:\u2014\"In my former report to Government, it was necessary to express an opinion on\nsome other plantations in this district, where the land which had been chosen was not suitable for Tea. Since that time these plantations have very properly been abandoned, and the land returned to the natives for the cultivation of rice and other crops, for which it is well adapted.\" I have no wish to revive the controversies raised by what may be called the \"Fortune Episode\" in the general history of Himalayan Tea; but in recounting my own experiences on the subject of Kumaon Tea in particular, it would have been almost dishonest to have maintained a complete silence on the vexata quaestio of moist and dry sites, or to have omitted some mention of the only remarkable official mistake committed in the course of a Government exploitation which at last culminated in such brilliantly successful results.\n\nPutting aside the point of controversy, which, after all, chiefly referred to a temporary state of the Kaolagiri plantation in Dehra Dun, the earlier deputation of Mr. Fortune to the Tea plantations\u2014a most important and beneficial event in the history of Indian Tea, being made by one thoroughly acquainted with China\u2014brought to proof quite as much as did his second, the very great impetus which had been given to the spread of the plant by the energetical efforts of Jameson.\n\nAfter the lapse of twenty-six years I still remember with the liveliest pleasure the visit of Fortune to Kumaon in 1851, and the enjoyment and profit I received from his interesting and instructive conversations at Naini Tal and its vicinity; while, of course, it was additionally satisfactory, as I then filled the principal official post in the province, to find that he sympathized with my views as to the future sites of the Tea plants.\n\n1 Formed by Dr. Jameson in 1844, and sold to the Rajah of Sirmur (Nehru) in 1867.\n\n2 Among other remarks in his first report occurs the following\u2014\"There is no such scarcity of Tea land (i.e., the hilly land, such as the tea plant delights in) in these mountains, more particularly in Eastern Garhwal and Kumaon. It abounds in the districts of Paurice, Kanpur, Lohia, Almora, Kuttan, and Bhowal, and I was informed by Mr. Batten that there are large tracts about Gomaraj and other places equally suitable. Most of this land is out of cultivation, while the cultivated portions yield on an average only two or three annas per acre of revenue.\nI had been a little disappointed by the result of a visit paid by Dr. Jameson in the autumn of 1846 to my pet tract, Kutyoor, concerning which he reported in July, 1847:\u2014\"I accompanied Mr. Commissioner Lushington to Byznath, being informed by him and Mr. Batten that in its neighbourhood a large tract of country well adapted to Tea cultivation was lying waste. Such, however, no doubt was the case prior to the last settlement; now all the irrigable land is covered with rich cultivation. I must, therefore, extend the plantations in the Chukhata district.\" It was with corresponding satisfaction that I found Mr. Fortune, in 1851, fully alive to the great importance of Kutyoor as a Tea district, and I cannot refrain from quoting at length his recorded opinions on the same subject:\u2014\"Kutoor is the name of a large district thirty or forty miles northward from Almorah, in the centre of which the old town or village of Byznath stands. It is a fine undulating country, consisting of wide valleys, gentle slopes and little hills, while the whole is intersected by numerous streams and surrounded by high mountains. The soil of this extensive district is most fertile, and is capable of producing large crops of rice on the low irrigable lands, and the dry grains and tea on the sides of the hills. From some cause, however, either the thinness of population or the want of a remunerative crop, large tracts of this fertile district have been allowed to go out of cultivation. Everywhere I observed ruinous and jungle-covered terraces, which told of the more extended cultivation of former years. Among some hills near the upper portion of this district, two small Tea plantations have been formed, under the patronage and superintendence of Captain Ramsay, Senior Assistant Commissioner. . . . . I never saw, even in the most favoured districts of China, any plantations looking better than these.\"\n\nIn my own Settlement Report, written in 1846, and printed in the Kumaon Official Reports, published by the Government of the N. W. Provinces, Agra, 1851, I had stated as follows: \"At one time, from the citadel of Runchoola above their capital Kuttoor, the ancient rulers of the hills must have\nlooked down and around on an almost unbroken picture of agricultural wealth, for, not only in the valleys, but up three-fourths of the mountain sides, now covered with enormous forests of pine, . . . . . . . . . . the well-built walls of fields remain in multitudinous array, terrace upon terrace, a monument of former industry and populousness, and only requiring the axe to prepare an immediate way for the plough. The valley of Byzanth, being situated on the frontier of Kumaon with Garhwal, and in the neighbourhood of Budhan Fort, was often, in all probability, the scene of border conflicts and military exactions, and, the desertion of villages having once commenced, the deterioration of climate, originating in the spread of rank vegetation, and the neglect of drainage, etc., may be supposed to have gone on from worse to worse, till finally the heat and moisture were left to perform all their natural ill-office, unchecked by the industry of man. Viewing, however, the present slight improvement in a hopeful light, and remembering the less favourable situations in which nurseries are thriving, I am of opinion that the district of Kuttoo (Byzanth) would be found the one most deserving of selection for the future spread of the Kumaon Tea cultivation. Irrigable unoccupied lands, at between 3,000 and 5,000 feet above the sea, abound on the lower slopes of the hills, while much of the good land in actual possession is occupied by migratory tenants at will, unattached to the soil, in whose place the Pudhans of villages could have no reasonable objection to see profit-paying, wealth-planting Gardeners.\u201d\n\nIn another place, after describing the desolation caused by tigers in the neighbouring Pergunnah of Gungolee, and after showing the small amount and precarious character of its revenue, and the facilities for obtaining waste lands, I added, \u201cI have named this Pergunnah as one of those most favourable for the Tea-growing experiment. I do not fear the expulsion of well-armed, and, what is better, well-paid Malkees from their fenced nurseries by the combined efforts of all the force nature of Gungolee.\u201d I may, I trust, be permitted to look back with pride to these, and\nother similar vaticinations with regard to Kumaon Tea, when, in 1877, I am able, in recording my recollections of my \"antiquae sedes,\" to point to the long list of flourishing Tea Plantations in Kutyoor, and now, on the earliest possible occasion, publicly to thank those of the existing Kumaon Planters who have given or sent to me their thanks for having been the first to declare the suitability of the sites now occupied by their estates, and to prophesy their future wealth. But my chief triumph, as it is, also, the main cause of the existing prosperity, may be seen in the fact\u2014one most kindly and hospitably brought before my own eyes in 1865, when I took leave of Kumaon during a final visit from my last Indian station, Agra,\u2014that Dr. Jameson himself established\\(^1\\) a principal nursery and factory at Ayar Toli, near Byznath, of more than 2,000 acres, which became the centre of the best and richest Tea district in Kumaon.\n\nI cannot conclude this paper without adding to the names, which, in these notes, have been mentioned in connexion with the introduction and progress of Tea in Kumaon and Garhw\u00e1l, the distinguished one of Sir John Strachey, the present Financial Minister of India, lately Lieut.-Governor of the N.W. Provinces, and, for more than ten years of his younger life, a most important member of the Kumaon Civil Commission. To him, I am bound to add, that the Hill Provinces owe an immense debt of gratitude. If Science owes to his well-known and able elder brothers, Colonel Henry Strachey, and General Richard Strachey, the pioneer development and elucidation of all that is most interesting in the geography and geology of the Himalayan regions, belonging to, or adjacent to, Kumaon,\u2014with no less distinction will the words Progress and Light be always associated with the name of John Strachey, in the civil, moral, intellectual, sanitary, and material history of Kumaon and Garhw\u00e1l.\\(^2\\)\n\n\\(^1\\) Under orders of Lieut.-Governor N.W. Provinces, dated 31st July 1854.\n\n\\(^2\\) As bearing on my own particular subject, the \"Notes on the Cultivation of Tea in Kumaon and Garhw\u00e1l,\" written by J. Strachey, Esq., Senior Assistant Commissioner, Garhwal, dated 30th May, 1854, and printed by the Government N.W. Provinces, among other papers of that year, at their Agra Press, may be referred to as a communication of the highest value. While deprecating any\nAs the very best commentary on what I have been stating, I append the list of private plantations in the Dehra D\u00fcn, which accompanied the admirable official memoir on that district in 1874 by Mr. G. R. C. Williams, Bengal Civil Service, and a similar list for Kumaon and Garhwal in 1877, which I have recently received from Almorah. Verily, the few seeds sown in those early diminutive plots in 1835, under the auspices of Traill and Falconer, have produced abundant fruit!\n\nThe very names of some of the gardens and of their proprietors are highly suggestive of that part of the history of Tea in the Hill Provinces, which has been omitted from this sketch, as not belonging to my own personal recollections, and as being likely to become the subject of future notice by competent authorities. Although the completion of the Government exploitation, the commencement and progress of private enterprise, the abandonment of the official experiments, and the several stages by which the present commercially successful result has been reached, have been left for description by others, I am not travelling beyond my own appointed record when, before closing this paper, I recur to the period which preceded the full working of his large factories at Hawalb\u0101gh, Bhimt\u0101l, Ay\u0101r Toli, Paori, and Kaolagir, by Dr. Jameson.\n\nThis period includes the decade of years from 1845 to 1855, during which the reins of government in the North-West Provinces were held by the hands of those highly distinguished and deeply lamented Lieutenant-Governors, the Honble. James Thomason and the Honble. John Russell Colvin, whose able Secretaries happily still survive, and could testify to the anxious interest taken by their chiefs in Tea culture. That interest led to a great amount of personal inquiry, and of consultation with the local officers, and to\n\nartificial forcing of tea cultivation. Mr. Strachey distinctly anticipated the fact of tea becoming a staple produce under the influence of European capital, and he urgently recommended the formation of good lines of road communication throughout the Hill Provinces.\n\n1 Mr. John Thomson, B.C.S., Retired, and Sir William Muir, K.C.S.I., late Lieutenant-Governor N.W.P.; and now, on the Council for India.\nmuch official correspondence, all which had reference and pointed to, the future popular establishment of the new industry, after the exploiting work of the State should have been accomplished. In those days, the increased prosperity of the Hill people as earners of wages was clearly prophesied, together with the creation in a new field of a staple produce, calculated to benefit our own countrymen, who might embark their capital in the tea-growing enterprise. But, undoubtedly, there was also mixed up with the discussions which then took place, a somewhat vague notion that the Pah\u00e1ri agriculturists would themselves engage in tea planting, and (to use a phrase which I find in one of my own Settlement reports) that the \"jealous occupants of rice and wheat fields would become humble applicants for tea seeds.\" Under this notion, various plans were proposed, and in some few cases adopted, for the introduction of the plant into villages, such as the free or conditional distribution of seeds, the granting advances (tucc\u00e1vee) to intending tea planters among the Zemindars, the promise to buy tea-leaves brought in by the peasants to the several factories, the establishment of petty tea farms under native managers, with assistance from Government in the way of small local manufactories for the skilful preparation of tea, and similar measures of encouragement; while, equally to Natives as to Europeans, the promise was held out that, at any re-settlement of revenue liabilities, no higher rate of assessment should be levied on tea lands than the average rate usual for lands yielding the best ordinary products; and last, not least, that good roads to markets should be opened.\n\nThe lists of existing planters show that the anticipations of that period have not been fulfilled with regard to the Native agriculturists, who have for the most part been content to supply in their own persons the well-paid and carefully supervised labour which has been, on experience, found to be necessary for the successful cultivation of tea by their European employers. Again, the records of the period to which I am referring show that, during the re-action occurring in favour of taking up for tea every available waste site, which\nsucceeded the time of selecting for that purpose only a few supposed appropriate localities, there were vast over-estimates put forward of the extent of territory suitable for the introduction of the plant; and the zeal, even of the prudent and wise Director of the Tea experiment, Dr. Jamieson, led him into language on this point which, doubtless, he would himself now allow to have been far too sanguine. On reverting to the correspondence of the year 1852, I find that, notwithstanding Mr. Fortune's and my own statement on the subject of land available for tea (which have been previously quoted in this paper), I myself (fortunately for my reputation at the present time) informed the Government\u00b9 that if 50 ready terraced waste sites in Garhw\u00e1l, and 150 similar sites in Kumaon, at absolute disposal of the State, could be found fit for survey, and for offer to tea speculators, that quantity would be as much as might fairly be expected. I am now credibly informed that my estimate was too high, and that unless a change of system should occur, and unless uncleared mountain slopes, covered with oaks and pines, should be thought suitable for the planting of future nurseries, instead of, as now, being only used for the supply of fuel and timber, the Kumaon and Garhw\u00e1l tea growers must give up the idea of occupying old abandoned sites, and must purchase from the Hill Zemindars whatever land they may require, within the area of existing occupied villages.\n\nWhether this state of affairs is matter for congratulation or for regret, is a topic on which I cannot now enter; though, however anxious I may be for the spread of tea cultivation, I, as a philanthropist, am inclined to rejoice in the absence of \"waste villages.\" But this sketch would have been manifestly incomplete if I had introduced, at its close, a statistical proof of the existing prosperity of the Tea industry, without some allusion to the early period, within my own memory, of preparation and hope which preceded it.\n\n\u00b9 Letter of Commissioner of Kumaon to Secretary of Government N.W.P., 10 Feb. 1852.\n### LIST OF PLANTATIONS IN KUMAON AND GARHWAL, 1877.\n\nFurnished by H.

VII.\u2014Note on Pliny's Geography of the East Coast of Arabia. By Major-General S. B. Miles, Bombay Staff Corps.\n\nAt the period Pliny wrote his Natural History, the whole coast of Arabia appears to have become tolerably well known to the Greeks and Romans. With the western and southern portions of the peninsula they had perhaps long been acquainted; but their knowledge of the eastern and more remote parts was of much more recent date. Regarding the history of their gradual acquisition of this knowledge, the light afforded us is very faint. Arrian mentions that the first attempt to sail round the Arabian Chersonese was made from the Red Sea in the hope of reaching the Persian and Susian shores, but that the expedition, after having coasted along the greatest part of Arabia, was compelled by want of water to sail back again. Who these navigators were, and by whose command they undertook the journey, he does not say, but it seems probable they came from Egypt.\n\nThe next attempts at the exploration of the eastern Arabian coast were due to the genius and ambition of Alexander the Great, but the information acquired by him was unfortunately to a great extent lost at his death, and, for a century and a half afterwards, those shores remained almost wholly unknown to Europeans, until, as we learn from Pliny, an exploration was ordered to be made by King Antiochus Epiphanes.\nDuring the voyage of Nearchus from the Indus he had, in passing through the Straits of Hormuz, sighted from a distance the great promontory of Maketa, but he did not visit it, nor does he seem to have learned the name of a single town on the Arab coast. His report to Alexander, however, doubtless served to stimulate the desire for conquest, and was partly the cause of the determination of that monarch to attempt an invasion of Arabia. It was with this view, and while preparations were being made for the enterprise, that Alexander, after his arrival at Babylon, sent out three successive expeditions to explore the coast, and obtain as much information as possible. The first of these expeditions was entrusted to the command of Archias, who had sailed with Nearchus, and had already distinguished himself. He, however, only sailed as far as the islands of El Bahrein, and then returned. The voyage of Androsthenes, who was next sent out, is described by Strabo from Eratosthenes. This expedition does not appear to have reached much further than the former one, as Tylos is the last place mentioned, and the distance Androsthenes gives from it to Cape Mussendom, viz. one day's sail (about sixty miles), is far too short: a mistake he could not have made had he actually navigated the intermediate space. The third vessel despatched was under Hiero, who sailed as far as a great promontory, beyond which he dared not go, and whence he returned to Alexander. Arrian states distinctly that none of these navigators succeeded in getting beyond Cape Mussendom, but it is possible he may have been mistaken, and that Hiero reached as far as Ras el Had. Presuming such to be the case, his voyage must be looked on as a considerable achievement, and second only in importance to that of Nearchus himself. No record, however, of the journey has been preserved, and the results of it, so far as the advancement of geography is concerned, were practically nil. Alexander alone seems to have been capable of appreciating the value and importance of these attempts; and when the master-mind was removed by death, the stores of geographical knowledge collected by him for the prosecution of his ambitious schemes were in great part lost.\nPliny himself, indeed, does not vouchsafe any further information regarding the expedition sent out by Antiochus, but it must have been a successful one and followed by others, as the relations of several navigators were extant in Pliny's day, from which he compiled his account. After this time the acquisition of knowledge continued to be rapid enough, as we may see from Ptolemy, whose systematic investigation gave him a pretty extensive acquaintance with the geography of the country; but it is much to be regretted that he contented himself with mentioning a few only of the most salient points on the Oman coast, and did not condescend to work up and embody in his own account all the material he undoubtedly had at his disposal. Pliny's list of localities is sufficiently copious, but the state of confusion it is in is almost chaotic. This is due to his own want of method, and partly to ignorance of the configuration of Arabia; for, notwithstanding his indefatigable industry, he copied down too indiscriminately, and, perhaps, too hastily, to admit of the names being arranged in proper order, and it is not surprising that his account should be not only full of repetitions, but also of misplacements of whole passages.\n\nThe state of Pliny's Arabia being thus obscure, does not render it very inviting to commentators, and not much, consequently, appears to have been effected towards its elucidation; the recent work, however, of Dr. A. Sprenger, on the ancient geography of Arabia, in which he has taken Ptolemy for his text, and made use of the old Arab geographers, has thrown so much light on the subject that there can be less hesitation now in venturing to follow it up.\n\nIn the twenty-sixth chapter, book vi., on the voyage to India, which is full of interest, Pliny makes mention incidentally of certain places on the southern coast of Arabia; and in the twenty-eighth chapter he discourses on the Arabian and Persian Gulfs; but it is in the thirty-second chapter that he more particularly describes the peninsula, and in this, after giving an account of the northern portion, he proceeds thus (I follow Riley's translation): \"We will now proceed to describe the coast after leaving Charax, which was first\nexplored by order of King Epiphanes. We first come to the place where the mouth of the Euphrates formerly existed, the river Salsus and the promontory of Chaldone, from which spot the sea along the coast for an extent of fifty miles bears more the aspect of a series of whirlpools than of ordinary sea; the river Achenus, and then a desert tract for a space of one hundred miles, until we come to the island of Ichara; the Gulf of Capeus, on the shores of which dwell the Gaulopes and the Chateni, and then the Gulf of Gerra. Here we find the city of Gerra, five miles in circumference, with towers built of square blocks of salt.\" The names in this passage are, with one or two exceptions, unrecognizable at the present day; but the natural features of the land are sufficiently marked to enable us to identify them with tolerable certainty. It shows, however, that Pliny's knowledge of the coast so far was greatly inferior to Ptolemy's. The river Salsus is most probably the same as the Coromanis of Ptolemy, and identical with Khor Subeyeh, between Bubiyan and the mainland. The prefix Cor in this and similar instances is equivalent to Khor, the Arabic word for a creek or inlet. Pliny has just before mentioned the Omani as a tribe extending from Petra to Charax, and I take Coromanis therefore to be Khor Omani, the creek of the Omani. Chaldone is the southern point of the Gulf of Koweyt, viz., Ras el Ard or Ras el Loor. The description of the sea off this part of the coast is somewhat exaggerated, and would be more applicable to Ras Tanooreh, about 200 miles lower down, which obtains its name from the confused and dangerous sea off it caused by the meeting of the tides there. Fifty miles below Chaldone is Achenus Fluvius, which, in consideration of the distance, I believe to be Khor el Zowar, a salt creek extending some distance, and used by coasting and fishing craft as a place of shelter. Ichara Insulae, 100 miles further, would appear to be the same as the Ichara of Ptolemy, and the island to which Alexander gave the name of Ikaros. The similarity of name would point to the island of Karak, opposite Bushire, but it is far more probably identical with Jezeeret Boo 'Ali, the only large island on the Bar el 'Adan. The Gulf of\nKapeus is Kateef Bay; Pliny's word being obviously a corruption of its present name, which we know from Arab writers to be an ancient one. The Gaulopes, who are said to dwell on these shores, I imagine to be some tribe that has since become extinct or absorbed, but there is a nomadic tribe lower down, the Ghafal\u00e9h (\u0627\u0644\u063a\u0627\u0641\u0644\u0629), to which the name may possibly refer. Sprenger's derivation is very ingenious and probable. The Chatteni are the same as the Attene and people of Attana mentioned immediately after by Pliny, and have been identified with the people of El Khatt, or the coast-line opposite to El Bahrain, and the subject will be found fully elucidated in Sprenger's work. There may possibly have been a town El Khatt there once, but it is no longer known, and the only village of that name I have heard of is on the pirate coast. The next position requiring to be determined, viz. the town of Gerra, is the most important on the whole coast, and its exact site has not even yet, I believe, been satisfactorily ascertained. The Gulf of Gerra is well known to be the same as the Gulf of El Bahrain, and Gerra itself, the grandest emporium of ancient times in the Persian Gulf, was situated some miles from the sea, probably at or near the present town of El Ahsa, its seaport being at El Ojeir. Strabo's account of Gerra is very similar to that of Pliny, and it is also mentioned by Arab geographers. The commerce and site of this emporium have formed the text of many writers.\n\nPliny continues: \"Fifty miles from the coast, lying in the interior, is the region of Attene, and opposite to Gerra is the island of Tylos, as many miles distant from the shore; it is famous for the vast number of its pearls, and has a town of the same name; in its vicinity there is a smaller island distant from a promontory on the larger one twelve miles and a half. They say that beyond this, large islands may be seen upon which no one has ever landed: the circumference of the smaller island is 112\u00bd miles, and it is more than that distance from the Persian coast, being accessible by only one narrow channel.\" The region of Attene, as already observed, is El Khatt, and the two islands, Tylos\nand the smaller one, which Strabo calls Aradus, have long since been satisfactorily identified with the Bahrein Islands; viz. 'Men\u00e2meh, formerly called Awal, and Maharrak. The name Tylos (\u015eoor) has quite disappeared from Men\u00e2meh, but a portion of Maharrak still bears the name Arad. Strabo tells us that these islands had temples resembling those of the Ph\u0153nicians, and that, according to the inhabitants, the islands and cities, bearing the same name as those of the Ph\u0153nicians, are their own colonies. The Ph\u0153nicians, there is no question, must have had several colonies or trading stations in the Persian and Oman Gulfs for the furtherance of their commercial operations, the real extent of which has perhaps not yet been fully appreciated. Besides Gerra and El Bahrein, they appear to have had one on the Persian coast at Sidodone, the village touched at by Nearchus, and possibly the same as Taw\u00e2nah near Charak. Another station was near Mussendom, as Arrian states Nearchus was informed there was a spice mart at Maketa, and there can be little hesitation in ascribing its establishment to the Ph\u0153nicians. Where it was situated we have no clue to guide us, but the most probable sites are Khasab and Ras el Kheimah. The present \u015eoor, 15 miles west of Ras el \u1e24ad, was another colony, and possibly also the town of Karyat, 30 miles S.E. of Muscat. The Tur of Niebuhr on Cape Julfar and the \u015eoor of Palgrave on the Beni Yas coast have, however, no real existence. It is certainly strange that \u015eoor near Ras el \u1e24ad is not mentioned either by the Hebrew writers or by the classical geographers, but the information afforded by them about the Ph\u0153nicians is so extremely meagre that the omission is the less significant. There can, I think, be no hesitation in looking upon \u015eoor as a Ph\u0153nician colony. The name alone is sufficient evidence, and its position as being the nearest port in Arabia to India, and the excellent security and suitability of its creek for native craft of the largest size, point it out as a spot which a keen-sighted commercial race like the Ph\u0153nicians could not have overlooked or disregarded. It has no harbour properly so called, but its extensive creek, which runs up in a serpentine\ndirection for nearly two miles, is more adapted for building and hauling up baghles than Muscat cove, and it has the advantage of free and open communication with the interior. It is in short a most advantageous place for such a settlement. The drawback at Soor is the want of good drinking water, which has to be obtained from a considerable distance. It was probably to some extent in connexion with this circumstance that led to the prosperity of the neighbouring town of El Kellat, only nine miles distant, where there was also a creek, but smaller and now filled up, and an abundant supply of pure fresh water. The other large island referred to by Pliny in the above-quoted passage is the arid and inhospitable peninsula of Qatar, which is but thinly peopled, and the inhabitants of which are to this day not particularly civil to strangers. The circumference of Men\u00e2neh is not more than 80 miles; it is about 140 miles distant from the Persian main, and it is separated from Maharrak by a channel of less than 1\u00bd miles. Off this coast the pearl fishery is still, I believe, the most extensive in the world; the average production at the present day being about \u00a3200,000 per annum. \"We then come to the island of Aelie and the nations of the Nocheti, the Zurazi, the Borgodi, the Catharrei, the Nomades, and then the river Cynos. Beyond this the navigation is impracticable on that side, according to Juba, on account of the rocks; and he has omitted all mention of Batrasse, a town of the Omani, and of the city of Omana, which former writers have made out to be a famous port of Carmania; as also of Homna and Attana, towns which, at the present day, our merchants say are by far the most famous ones in the Persian sea. Passing the river Cynos there is a mountain, Juba says, that bears marks of the action of fire; also the nation of the Epimaranites, then a nation of Ichthyophagi, and then a desert island, and the nation of the Bathymii.\" There is no other island about here to which Pliny's names can be referred with any probability, but, on the east side of Men\u00e2neh island, there is a village called 'Asker, which Pliny, or perhaps the traveller he copied from, may have\nmistaken for another island. The Nocheti are unknown to me. The Zurazi (var. Zurachi) and Borgodi are found by Blau at Zurak and Borgod, two towns in El Ahsa.\n\nThe Catharrei are of course the people of Ka\u1e6dar, and the Nomades refer to the numerous Bedouin tribes on this coast. The river Cynos I believe to be identical with the Lar of Ptolemy, which can be no other than the great watercourse that receives the drainage of south-east Nejd, and finds its outlet at Khor el Dhoan, and is now known by the name of Wady So\u1e25beh. Ptolemy says the source of the Lar is in Nejran, by which he only means, I suppose, that it comes from a long distance in the interior, and in this he is right. The Wady So\u1e25beh is the only river-bed on this coast at all answering to this description, and though the position laid down by Ptolemy does not quite suit, the natural feature is too marked to be mistaken. The statement of Juba about the impracticable nature of the coast for navigation to the eastward is perfectly true and applicable, as, so far as Abuthabee, it is full of rocks and shoals, and unapproachable by any but the smallest craft, and is a further corroboration of the identity of Cynos with So\u1e25beh. Pliny here censures Juba for not mentioning Batrasave and Omana, but though he has the merit of supplying the omission, it is clear he does not know where to locate them himself. The former is most likely Seeb, a commercial town on the shore, thirty miles from Muscat, at the embouchure of the Semail Valley, and a place of considerable trade. Ba\u1e6dha means a river-bed or watercourse in a sandy country, and Ba\u1e6dha Seeb is a name retained to this day, though its more frequent appellation is Ba\u1e6dha Fanja. The city of Omana is So\u1e25ar, the ancient capital of Oman, which name, as is well known, it then bore, and Pliny seems to be quite right in correcting former writers, who had placed it in Carmania, on which coast there is no good evidence that there ever was a place of this name. Nearchus does not mention it, and though the author of the Periplus of the Erythr\u00e6an sea does locate it in Persis, it is pretty evident he never visited the place himself, and he must have mistaken the information he obtained from others.\nIt was this city of Sohar most probably that bore the appellation of Emporium Persarum, and in which, as Philostorgius relates, permission was given to Theophilus, the Ambassador of Constantine, to erect a Christian church. Homna and Attana are, I believe, simply repetitions through ignorance of Omana or Sohar, and Atene or El Khatj, which he has already mentioned. After, that is to the eastward of Khor el Dhoan, there lies, though Pliny does not notice it, the Sabkha or Sabkha Matihi, a strip of marshy ground extending many miles westward toward El Jabrin. This Sabkha is recognized by the Arabs as the natural boundary between El Nejd and Oman, and hence consequently the description of the Oman coast may properly be said to commence. Ptolemy has a place called Surkoe (\u03a3\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03cc\u03b7), and Sprenger takes this for Sabkoe (\u03a3\u03b1\u03b2\u03ba\u03ce\u03b7) or Sabkha, which seems to me a highly probable, and at the same time a very important identification. The Epimaranite may be the Al Murra or Abu Murra, a very widely scattered tribe on the borders of the Great Desert, but Sprenger takes them to be the Abu Neyr, the Naritun of Ptolemy, a tribe that gave their name to the island Sir Abu Neyr, but now extinct. The Bathymi are, I have no doubt, the people of Buthabee or Abuthabee, the head-quarters at present of the Beni Yas tribe. This is by far the largest town on the whole pirate coast, having a population of 20,000 inhabitants, but the drawback here, as at Soor, is the scarcity of sweet water. The mountain showing the action of fire is not improbably Jebel Barakbeh, but the low hills on that treacherous shore are all of plutonic origin, as I am informed by a gentleman who has visited it. The term Ichthyophagi does not require much explanation, as it is well known the inhabitants of Abuthabee and the settlements on that coast are entirely dependent on the sea for support, and the appellation could not be more appropriately applied than to them. There is very little intercourse between these nomads of the sea and the still wilder nomads of the desert, but there is a little mart called Redeym, where the latter come at certain seasons to barter their small requirements; there are, however, no\nThe desert island is Jezeeret ala al-Masirah. The region is the height, and quite uninhabited, except they are all except Dalmah.\n\nWe then came to the Shatran mountains, the island of Muzzaqin, the coast of Musandam, the islands of Etaxalos and Musandam, and the mouth of the Khasi. There are many islands, and not more in number, but the better known ones are Sana, Humma, and another still nearer the shore, upon which there are some stone pillars with an inscription in ancient characters.\n\nWe are now advancing along the pirate coast towards Ras Musandam, and the account before us will be found to distinctly show a very extensive communication with the Oman coast. Amongst the most noted among Pliny's notes first the Eblisian mountains. The promontory, the most remarkable geographical feature at the western coast of Arabia, was called Aswad by Nearchus, who observed it while coasting along the opposite shores. The sight of it led to a discussion between him and Demetrius, who wished him to change his course and follow the land mass, but he fortunately decided against it. Pliny calls this cape \"\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03ba\u03c1\u03c5\u03bd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2\" (apomakrynsis). However, he also says it is \"\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03ba\u03c1\u03c5\u03bd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2\" (apomakrynsis), and Marrian Passabo Mons. However, \"\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03ba\u03c1\u03c5\u03bd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2\" (apomakrynsis) and Sprenger considers it as a corruption of the Arabic word Aswad, black.\n\nThis cape also makes refers to this cape; once in chapter describing the voyage of Nearchus, he says \"\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03ba\u03c1\u03c5\u03bd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2\" (apomakrynsis), a name of Arabia, dwell; and again, \"\u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03ba\u03c1\u03c5\u03bd\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2\" (apomakrynsis), he calls it the promontory of the Arabian sea. It is therefore reasonable that the names are of two kinds, one derived from the character or colour of the rock, and the other from the name of the tribe inhabiting it. There is no tribe in Oman bearing this name today, but there is a village in the valley and village of El 'Akk near Musandam and Suraili. In Malcolm Inlet there is a village named Musandam village, and in Elphinstone Inlet there is another village, but I do not venture to assert that these\nhave any connexion with the former name, as the orthography is radically different, and I merely note it as a coincidence. The rocky promontory of Mussendom is at present inhabited by the Shihiyin tribe, with a few Persian and other settlers. The Shihiyin are a very curious and primitive race, and were probably driven into this corner by the influx of more powerful tribes; they do not appear to have attracted the attention they deserve. They hold themselves aloof as much as possible from the Arabs, and do not intermarry with them, I believe, if they can avoid it. The whole tribe is divided into two sections, the Beni Hedeya (\u0628\u0646\u064a \u0647\u062f\u064a\u0629) and El Koomazareh (\u0627\u0644\u0643\u0645\u0627\u0632\u0631\u0629), and a part of the latter, settled at Koomz\u00e4r and on the island of Larek, retain a peculiar dialect, which is unintelligible to Arabs, and is probably one of the several dialects spoken in the peninsula before Islam.\n\nOmoenus is Umm el Kowein, a flourishing little town of the Al Ali tribe, situated on a low sandy island formed by the intersection of two creeks, Khor Umm el Kowein and Khor el Beitheh. The old town was destroyed by the British force in 1819, and was at some little distance from the present settlement. The port of Mochorbe is unknown to me, and I can make no suggestion at all satisfactory to myself. On this coast Bochart and many of the best authorities have located the Raamah of Ezekiel and the Regama of Ptolemy, and the name has been recognized in the present village of Rams, a few miles to the north of Ras el Kheimah. The identity of Raamah and Regama will be acknowledged without hesitation, but the identity of both with Rams will perhaps not be so easily admitted, from the radical difference of the orthography, which appears to me a considerable difficulty. The gens Kad\u00e6i I look upon as the people of Kad\u00e6h, a village with a date-plantation close to Khasab, or the name may remain in the Mak\u00e4d\u00f6eh, one of the subtribes of the Shihiyin. On this coast lies the \u1f08\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78\u03c1 of Ptolemy, or the promontory of the sanctuary of the Sun. Allowing Ptolemy\u2019s longitudes to be not always quite accurate, I think this can be no other than the triangular peninsula formed by Khor el Sham and Khor Gh\u00fcb Ali, and\non which is a high hill called Jebel Sham. If this conjecture be well founded, it is a singular coincidence that the name of the inlet is again changing to Khor el Seem, or Telegraph Inlet, from the fact of the Persian Gulf cable having been landed there, and a station established a few years back.\n\nWe have now five islands to dispose of, viz.: Etaxalos, Inchobrice, Isura, and Rhinnea, with one having no name given to it, but remarkable as having an undecipherable inscription on stone pillars. Having regard to the confused state of Pliny's account, we cannot expect to find these islands quite in the order he has given them, and as he has added no description, we have nothing to guide us but the similarity of name and the supposition that he alludes to the more important ones in that sea. Etaxalos I take, therefore, to be the same as Et Tawakkal, an island off Cape Mussendom, and Inchobrice an inversion of Ras Kabr Hindi (Hindi Kabr Ras), the latter probably being a corruption of some ancient name. This is, in fact, only a peninsula, but it is joined by so narrow an isthmus, hardly 100 yards broad, that it was very likely mistaken for an island. Isura and Rhinnea are Sel\u00e2mah wa Ben\u00e2tha, the two quoins called also by the Arabs Koseyr and Qweyr. The island still nearer the shore is Mussendom, which still bears the remains of Titanic masonry attributed as usual to the Adites. The stones in this are squared and smoothed similarly to those at Nakab el Hajar, which is not the case, so far as I know, in any other ruins in Oman. The remark about the other islands is fairly correct, as there are numerous rocky islets off the Cape, though probably few of them are nameless. The straits between the island of Mussendom and the mainland are called El Bab, and this is the origin of the name of the Papi\u00e6 Islands mentioned in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. The Mons Pulcher of the same is Jebel Lahreem or Sh'uam, the loftiest and most conspicuous peak on the whole cape, being nearly 7000 feet high. The next following passage of Pliny I omit, as it should unmistakably have been included in his account of the Red Sea, though he gives no indication here of having\nleft the Oman coast. \"We then come,\" he continues, \"to the Sabaei, a nation of Skenites, with numerous islands, and the city of Akilla, which is their mart, and from which persons embark for India. We next come to the region of Amithoecuta, Damnia, the greater and the lesser Mizi, and the Drimati. The promontory of the Naumachaei over against Carmania is distant from it fifty miles. A wonderful circumstance is said to have happened here. Numenius, who was made Governor of Mesene by King Antiochus, while fighting against the Persians, defeated them at sea, and at low water by land, with an army of cavalry on the same day; in memory of which event he erected a twofold trophy on the same spot, in honour of Jupiter and Neptune. Opposite to this place, in the main sea, lies the island of Ogyris, famous for being the burial-place of King Erythros; it is distant from the mainland one hundred and twenty miles, being one hundred and twelve in circumference.\" The dire confusion in Pliny's mind regarding the configuration of this part of Arabia is well exemplified in this curious passage. Notwithstanding the repetitions and derangement of the proper order, there is but little obscurity; the names and places are as easily recognizable in most cases as if he had correctly defined their positions. Pliny is fond of islands, and he has here indulged himself freely, but he might easily have avoided again mentioning the promontory over against Carmania. Most geographers appear to place Akilla in the Red Sea, identifying it with Okelis, and it is quite evident that both Pliny and Strabo have confounded two places under this name. As I have elsewhere endeavoured to show, this name refers to El Kilhat, a very ancient town close to Soor, and the numerous islands are the three groups off the Batinah coast, which are called in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, the islands of Kalaina. Amithoecuta is Muscat, as is also the Cryptus Portus of Ptolemy, an identification too generally admitted to require demonstration. It is impossible to conceive a more felicitous and apposite appellation for it than that given by Ptolemy, and many are the instances I could adduce in illustration of the difficulty vessels\nbound for Muscat from an easterly direction have in finding the entrance. Damnia has generally been considered a town, and searched for on the coast, but I take it to be more likely meant for the Deym\u00e2niyeh islands, the centre of the three groups lying off the Bat\u00eenah coast, and consisting of seven islands nearly opposite to Barka; they have been already mentioned as the islands of Akilla. It would appear at first view as if Pliny had omitted to mention the promontory of Ras el \u1e24ad, from which point the coast falls to the south and west. It is true he does not notice the existence here of a promontory at all, and the omission is certainly a remarkable one, but it happens curiously enough that he does mention the very same and much more peculiar natural feature, the name of which has been transferred by Ptolemy to the headland. By the eminent geographer D\u2019Anville, the promontory of Syagros was assigned to Ras el \u1e24ad, and though this error has been rectified by Dr. Vincent in favour of Korodamon, the latter name has always remained a puzzle which will, I venture to hope, be considered removed by the recognition of Korodamon in Khor Jer\u00e2mah. Further, it is easy to discern the identity of the region of the Drimati or (stripped of its Latin termination) Derima with Jer\u00e2mah and Odamon, and I therefore look on them all as one and the same name and place. The Cape Ras el \u1e24ad is in itself a low sandy point, with nothing remarkable about it to attract attention. The feature noticed by Pliny and Ptolemy, on the contrary, viz. Khor Jer\u00e2mah, is a capacious and invaluable natural basin and harbour of refuge, and is exactly what would necessarily have fixed itself in the minds of the navigators of that age, who were compelled to creep carefully along the coast and take advantage of every available shelter. At the commencement and end of the monsoons crowds of baghlas may be seen collected together in this lagoon, lying as safe as if in dock, filling up cargo and stores from \u0160oor, preparatory to starting on their voyage for the season. Khor Jer\u00e2mah is at present in possession of the M\u00e1lkhi tribe, and at the bottom of it are the ruins of an ancient town called\nLebede. The greater and lesser Mizi are obscure; the former is perhaps meant for the island of Maseera, and the latter may be the largest island of the Kuria Muria group, or they may both refer to this group. The first syllable of Naumach\u00e6orum Promontorium is evidently due to corruption, and certainly does not properly form part of the name. Sprenger ingeniously suggests that Nau is for Ras Nus in Kuria Muria Bay, which seems a very happy and probable identification. The wonderful circumstance that happened here to Numenius derives more wonder from the locality at which it took place, that is, if Pliny really means that the battle was fought at Cape Makar, but it seems to me more probable that Carmania was the field of it. If it was Mussendom, it must have occurred somewhere in the vicinity of Ras el Kheima, but even here the country is quite unsuited for cavalry, as there is no grass or forage for horses along the whole of the pirate coast, and how Numenius' army of cavalry managed to support itself is not easy to conceive. The island of Ogyris is Maseera, the Serapis of the Periplus, which is, however, only nine miles from the mainland, but it is creditable to Pliny that he gives it the same circumference as the island of Tylos, which is quite correct; they correspond in size almost exactly. Pliny now passes on to Hadramaut, whither I have no intention of following him at present. In another passage further on, however, he appears to return again to the Persian Gulf, as some of the names undoubtedly belong there, but there is so much doubt and confusion that it seems hopeless to unravel it satisfactorily. He says: \"Next to these are the Chaculatae, then the town of Sibi, by the Greeks called Apate, the Arsi, the Codani, the Vadei, who dwell in a large town; the Barasamai, the Lechieni, and the island of Sygaros, into the interior of which no dogs are admitted, and so being exposed on the sea-shore, they wander about there and are left to die.\n\n* It has been surmised that the Ras el Gaid of the Portuguese is a corruption of Ras el Had. But the Ras el Gaid (\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u062c\u064e\u0627\u062f\u0650) of the Arabs is at Soor, just fifteen miles from Ras el Had, and there can be little doubt, I think, that the Portuguese pilots confounded the names of two neighbouring headlands.\nWe then come to a gulf which runs far into the interior, upon which are situate the L\u00e6anit\u00e6, who have given to it their name; also their royal city of Agra, and upon the gulf that of L\u00e6ana, or, as some call it, \u00c6lana; indeed, by some of our writers this has been called the \u00c6lanitic Gulf, and by others again the \u00c6lenitic; Artemidorus calls it the Alemitic, and Juba the L\u00e6nitic.\" Who the Chaculat\u00e6 are I cannot guess even. The town of Sibi is probably Seeb, which he mentioned above as Batrasave, the word Apate being the equivalent of El Batha. The Arsi are perhaps the Harth, a powerful tribe in Oman; the Codani, the Beni Kodha. The Vadei I take to be the inhabitants of Wady Semail, the most populous valley in Oman, and in which is the large town of Semail. The Barasasei seem to be the people of a place in Maseera Island, called Abu Rasas, the island itself being called just after Sygaros, a variation, doubtless, of Ogyris. The Lechieni are identified by Sprenger with the Lihyan tribe in the Persian Gulf, and are the same as the L\u00e6anit\u00e6; but Pliny has made terrible confusion here by confounding the name with that of the Elenitic Gulf in the Red Sea.\nART. VIII.\u2014The Maldives Islands: with a Vocabulary taken from Fran\u00e7ois Pyrard de Laval, 1602\u20131607. By A. Gray, late of the Ceylon Civil Service.\n\nIt is one of several disadvantages which the island of Ceylon has had to endure in its political separation from the Anglo-Indian empire, that its language has until lately been left out of the category of Indian tongues, and has received but little attention, except from the few scholars whom so small a country has been able to produce. There has also been an unfortunate wrangling among those who have touched the subject as to whether Sinhalese is a Turanian or an Aryan tongue. This dispute has now for some time been settled in favour of the Aryan origin; and we can but repeat the surprise of Professor Childers that Mr. Beames should omit the Sinhalese in his \"Comparative Grammar of Modern Aryan Languages of India.\" The mere mention of the name of Childers recalls the immense loss occasioned to Ceylon literature by his death\u2014a loss which has been sadly crowned by the death of Dr. Paul Goldschmidt, at a time when his two years' labours in the island were about to bear fruit. It will not be long, we trust, ere others equally competent will be induced to devote themselves to the work which these eminent scholars pursued.\n\nIt was Dr. Goldschmidt's task to investigate the history of the Sinhalese language back to its Indian sources, to define as accurately as might be the influences of Sanskrit and Pali, and to note its correspondence and kinship with the other descendants of those ancient tongues, and finally to mark its history through the period when it was known as Elu down to the Sinhalese of to-day. A study of Sinhalese and of the\n\n1 See Childers, J.R.A.S. n.s. Vol. VII, p. 40.\nSinhalese inscriptions was of course the first and principal stage; but the work would not have been complete without an examination of the dialect of the Maldives Islands, where, as has long been known, a race of Sinhalese origin resides, and a language of Sinhalese descent is spoken. And it was during Dr. Goldschmidt's first year in Ceylon, while I was in almost daily intercourse with him, that a visit to the Maldives was suggested, which was fated never to be performed. On my return to this country in 1876, it struck me that the vocabulary which I now offer might be of some use to Dr. Goldschmidt, before he could visit the islands himself, and it was chiefly with this view that I compiled it. I was also aware that the late Governor of Ceylon, Sir W. Gregory, had long entertained hopes of being able to visit these islands during his term of office; but he has returned to Europe without effecting a journey which would have had results as important and beneficial to those concerned as have accrued to Ceylon from his aesthetic tastes and kindly interest in things native.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Pyrard of Laval in Bas-Maine was one of a company of French adventurers, who, incited by the reports of great discoveries made and vast wealth gained by the mariners of other countries in the sixteenth century, equipped two vessels, which left St. Malo in Normandy in the year 1601. Pyrard was on board the Corbin. Both vessels rounded the Cape, and left Madagascar in safety; but the Corbin, piloted by an Englishman who had lost his bearings in the Indian Ocean, was wrecked on the Malosmadou Atoll of the Maldives on the 2nd July, 1602. The crew were taken captive, and all the property recovered from the wreck became by Maldivian law the property of the king. The subsequent history of the captives bears a strong resemblance to that of Knox's crew in Ceylon. They were dispersed to various islands, to prevent conspiracy to escape. Some were executed, many died from sickness. Pyrard, by learning the language and conducting himself discreetly, won, as Knox did, the favour of his guardians, and, finally, of the king; and in the same way was allowed to go from island to island for\npurposes of trade. His captivity was shorter than that of Knox. In 1607, when he had been five years at the islands, the King of Bengal made a descent with a powerful fleet manned by Mukwas, ravaged the islands, slew the king, and conveyed Pyrard to India. Here he underwent many further adventures and more captivity, and it was not till 1611 that he once more set foot on the beloved soil of France. His adventures, and his evident honesty in their narration, created so warm an interest in the publication of his book, that it went through no less than four editions in the seventeenth century.\n\nRegarding these editions it is necessary to make the following remarks.\n\n1st, of 1611, 8vo., published the year of Pyrard's return. It is hardly one-fifth the size of the third or fourth edition, and was evidently a hasty sketch of a story which was creating interest at the time. It is said to have been written not by Pyrard himself, but, at his dictation, by Pierre Bergeron. Querard, in his \"Supercheries Litteraires Devoil\u00e9es,\" remarks: \"Une premi\u00e8re r\u00e9daction bien moins d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e avait \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9e avec le nom de Pyrard... Huet a mentionn\u00e9 sur son exemplaire poss\u00e9d\u00e9 par la Biblioth\u00e8que imp\u00e9riale que Pyrard n'avait fait que fournir les m\u00e9moires sur lesquels Bergeron \u00e9crivit cette relation; ce fait est confirm\u00e9 par le t\u00e9moignage de Sorbi\u00e8re qui d\u00e9clare 'ce Pyrard chirurgien assez idiot et qui n'\u00e9tait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de former un discours de langue haleine' (Sorberiana, p. 115).\"\n\n2nd, of 1615\u201316, 8vo. I have not seen this edition. It is not in the British Museum. I find, however, from the French Catalogue of Voyages, that it is in all probability the same as the third. It contains the Maldive vocabulary.\n\n3rd, of 1619, 8vo. This is the edition I have used, preferring it to the fourth, as it was published under the supervision of the author, and contains the vocabulary.\n\n4th, of 1679, 4to. This edition was edited by Duval, after the death of Pyrard. It seems to be a careful reprint of the third, but for some reason the vocabulary has been omitted.\n\nBesides these French editions, the work has been translated\nTHE MALDIVIAN ISLANDS.\n\nnot French and Portuguese. Abridgments of it will be found in more French collections of voyages: I may instance \"Histoire des Voyages de la Haye, 1753,\" vol. 10; Charton, \"Voyages Anciens et Modernes\" (Paris, 1856), vol. 4. Also in \"Purchas's Pilgrims,\" and \"The World Discover'd,\" etc., vol. ii. A few pages have been translated by Capt. Colvin, in the Ceylon Geog. Journ. vol. ii. The book has not yet received the attention it deserves in England, and I am surprised that it possesses a single copy of it. It does not appear in the Catalogue of the Ceylon Asiatic Society's Library, and although I have not a list to refer to, it is unlikely that such a little known should be in the Colombo Library. Even if it be there, I presume that some advance in the knowledge of the Maldivian language may be made by publishing the interesting vocabulary of Pyrard. The only vocabulary with which I am acquainted is that given by Mr. Christopher, R.N., in the J.R.A.S. Vol. VI. Mr. Christopher was engaged under the Indian Government in the survey of the Atolls, and during his residence there he seems to have obtained a considerable acquaintance with the language. As it will be of great importance to scholars to compare the language of the beginning of the seventeenth century with that of the nineteenth, I have placed side by side with Pyrard's the words given wherever given by Christopher to express the same idea. I have not thought it necessary to copy the whole of Christopher's vocabulary, for two reasons: (i.) the J.R.A.S. is accessible to all scholars; (ii.) the language as given by him is that of to-day, and any one who visits the Atolls will find living dictionaries of more than the thousand words or so given by Christopher.\n\n1 Mr. Christopher obtained leave from the Bombay Government to remain until the Survey was completed for the purpose of studying the people and language. His stay extended from June, 1854, to September, 1855.\u2014Trans. Bom. Geog. Soc., vol. i., p. 55.\n\n2 No attempt can yet be made to discuss the question of Maldivian grammar; though, if my information is correct, Mr. L. de Coze Mudaliyar is collecting materials for the purpose. The Ceylon Government would do well to hint to the Maldivian Sultan that a few manuscripts would be a more acceptable offering than the countless lumps fish and cakes brought by the last annual Ambassador.\nFrom a comparison of Pyrard's Maldivan with Sinhalese, philologists may be able to hazard an opinion as to the date of the separation of the races. I will translate here Pyrard's remarks on the origin of the Maldivans:\n\n\"The natives hold that the Maldives were formerly peopled by the Cingala (so the inhabitants of Ceylan are named), but I find that the Maldivans do not at all resemble the Cingala, who are black and ill shapen. The former are well shaped and proportioned, and differ but little from ourselves, except in their colour, which is olive. Yet it may be believed that the climate and lapse of time have rendered them more fair than were those who first colonized the islands.\"\n\nAgain, \"They say that the Maldives began to be inhabited about 400 years ago [circa A.D. 1200], and that the first who came and peopled them were (as I have already said in passing) the Cingalles of the island of Ceylan, which is not far distant, and were idolaters, but have since changed their religion, it being about 150 or 200 years at most since they received Mahometanism through the Moors and Arabs, who, while trading over all the continent and islands of India, brought there also their law, which has since remained in most of those parts.\" It also appears that it was then that the Tartars, who extended their dominion throughout the East, and even to these islands, became infected with this accursed and false doctrine of Mahomet. The Maldivans have ever since retained this faith even to the present time.\"\n\nIn the second part of his book Pyrard has a chapter on Ceylon, which commences thus:\n\n\"While I was at Goa with the Portuguese, I was a soldier in most of the armies which they equipped while I sojourned among them, chiefly on the coast where Goa is, in the island of Ceylan, in Malacca, Sumatra, Java, and other\n\n---\n\n1 Ibn Batuta, while residing at the Maldives, married, about 1340 A.D., the daughter of a viceroy who was grandson of the Sultan Daoud, who was the grandson of Chomorazah, the first king who embraced the Muhammadan faith \u2014 Ibn Bat., Paris, 1868, vol. iv., p. 194. The probable date of the conversion is therefore 1200 A.D. Ibn Batuta saw the record engraven in wood in the chief mosque, f.n. p. 181.\nislands of the Sound, and the Moluccas, and was paid as the others.\"\n\nHe did not apparently serve long in Ceylon, and perhaps did not go beyond the Portuguese fortresses of Colombo and Galle. His knowledge of the Kandyan kingdom amounts to this: \"The principal and greatest king of the island is called Rashil; there are many other kings.\" He mentions that the Sinhalese \"wear their hair long, as do the Maldivans.\" When he says that the Maldivans are olive and the Sinhalese black, one is tempted to think that he served only in a Tamil district of Ceylon, and never saw the fair-skinned Kandyans. I shall point out hereafter that Pyrard knew of Tamil only as the language of Ceylon.\n\nThe date given by Pyrard of the colonization of the Maldives (A.D. 1200) must be put back several centuries. Pappus of Alexandria (end of the fourth century A.D.) reckoned 1370 islands as dependencies of Ceylon.\u00b9 Fah-Hian (beginning of fifth century A.D.) says: \"On every side (of Ceylon) are small islands, perhaps amounting to one hundred in number. They are distant from one another ten or twenty li, and as much as two hundred li. All of them depend on the great island. Most of them produce precious stones and pearls\" (Beal's Buddhist Pilgrims, p. 148). We hear also of these islands from Ptolemy and Cosmas. Both lead us to suppose that they were inhabited in their day. Cosmas (sixth century) says: \"Around the island (Taprobane) are a great number of small islands; all possess fresh water, and are planted with coco-nut. They are situate very close to each other.\" He gives them no name.\n\nSuleyman, the Persian traveller of the ninth century (see Reinaud, Relation des Voyages faits par les Arabes, et les Persans dans l'Inde et \u00e0 la Chine dans le ix\u1d49 si\u00e8cle), calls them Dybadjat,\u00b2 and mentions that \"they are governed by a queen, that they are all inhabited, and that a brisk trade\n\n\u00b9 Moses Chorenensis, by Whiston, 1736, p. 367.\n\u00b2 Afterwards corrupted by Arab writers to Rybah\u00e2t, and by the French to Roibah\u00e2t.\nwas carried on in cowries, amber, and coir.\" A notice of the Maldives will also be found in the travels of the two Muhammadans (ninth century), a translation of which is given in the seventh volume of Pinkerton's Voyages.\n\nAlbyrouny (eleventh century) calls them all Dyvah, dividing them into Dyvah Kenzah, i.e. Cowrie Islands, and Dyvah Kaubar, the Coir Islands, from their chief products.\u00b9\n\nI find no mention in Pyrard of any other race who may have yielded to Sinhalese conquerors, and if the Sinhalese were the first colonists, they were probably there as far back as the Christian era, when Ceylon was a powerful monarchy. There are probably many passages in the various unpublished Sinhalese books bearing upon the relations of the Maldives with Ceylon prior to the Portuguese advent, and the Sinhalese pandits would do a service by extracting such information. Of demon worship, bali worship, and Sinhalese superstitions generally, abundant illustration is afforded by both Pyrard and Christopher, in descriptions which have their counterpart in Knox's 'Ceylon.' On the other hand, there are but few traces of Buddhism.\u00b2 The principal festival, that of poyacan, celebrated at the full moon of April or May, at once recalls the 'dep\u014dya' (full moon) of Wesak (May), when the Sinhalese commemorate the attainment of Nirvana by Gautama. But the Maldivans attribute the origin of the festival to the first introduction of rice to the islands, which would connect it rather with the 'Alut S\u0101l,' or new rice, festival of Ceylon (held in January), than with the thoroughly Buddhistic holiday of May (v. mfrd., p. 261, s.v. Poyacan). It can hardly be that the Maldivans, living in close proximity, if not subject,\u00b3 to the Sinhalese,\n\n\u00b9 Journ. Asiatique, 1844, p. 265\n\u00b2 Lieut. Christopher remarks (Trans. Birm. Geog. Soc. vol. i. p. 313), that he had been informed by a Buddhist pandit that two Buddhist tombs were removed in one of the Atolls, the names of which he could not forget. The name of one of the islands of Male' Atoll is 'P\u0113k\u0113ra maha p\u014dya,' the delightful cry of children. It is also said that the Maldivan dead are buried in the posture of the statues of the recumbent Buddha, i.e. with the right hand under the right ear, and the left on the left thigh, the body being laid on the right side. Christopher also says that the bo-tree is still grown at the mosques, and held in veneration.\n\u00b3 Tennent's Ceylon, vid. n. p. 178. Beal's Buddhist Pilgrims, p. 148. Morse Observations, 1798, p. 267.\nescaped conversion during those centuries when the missionary spirit was still in Buddhism, and they themselves had only a barbarous faith; yet the traces of an intervening Buddhism are curiously faint. Whatever further inquiry in that direction may prove, the picture presented by the modern religious state of the two branches of the Sinhalese family is curious indeed. The one has held to the cosmopolitan principles, the atheistic creed, and the simple worship of the Buddhist faith; the other has adopted the exclusive, monotheistic, and ceremonious faith of Muhammad. These religions have not, however, altered to any extent the characteristics of the race, and both have suffered the co-existence of the older worship of demons and of the elements,\u2014a common inheritance of both branches of the family, but an alien to both their creeds. It may be that during long centuries no life was imparted to Maldive Buddhism from Ceylon, and that the religion of 'the Blessed One' at last flickered to extinction, while the barbarous rites and superstitions of the dewales and the groves remained connected in the native mind with those purely temporal ills from which in their daily life men sought deliverance. Such must have been the religious state of the Maldives when the Arabs began to frequent the Atolls\u2014a worship of devils who brought sickness, and of the wind and stars who ruled the sea\u2014and it must have been without real resistance that another realm was added to the vast spiritual empire of Islam.\n\n1 The modern Maldive for 'image' is budu (J.R.A.S. Vol. VI. p. 57). Ibn Batuta (Paris ed. 1868, vol. iv. p. 126) mentions boudkh\u0101nah 'an idol temple'; see next note. The word bodd, however, was a general term for an idol temple with the Arab Oriental travellers, and seems only to indicate that the Buddhist parts of India were the first visited by the Arabs.\u2014Journ. Asiat. 1845, p. 167.\n\n2 The story of the Muhammadan conversion, as given by Ibn Batuta, containing so curious a record of the superstitious worship mentioned by Pyrard (v.i. sub v. Stare), and existing at the present day, should not be omitted in this connexion:\u2014\"When the people of the islands were idolaters, there appeared to them every month an evil spirit, who came from the sea, resembling a ship filled with lamps. It was the custom of the natives when they beheld him to adorn a young virgin, and to conduct her to a boudkh\u0101nah, or temple of idols, built on the shore, and having a window by which she could be seen. They left her for the night, and when they returned in the morning they found her violated and dead. So every month they cast lots, and he on whom the lot fell gave up his daughter. In course of time arrived a Maghr\u00e9bin, named Abou'l Berec\u00e4t, the\nI have collected the remarks of Pyrard concerning the Maldive language, and will now give a translation of them. The reference before each passage is to the page of the third edition of Pyrard's Voyage.\n\nP. 138. \"There are two languages in use. The first is that peculiar to the Maldives, which is a very full one. In the five years and more which I spent there I had mastered it as though it were my mother-tongue, and was quite familiar with it. The second is the Arabic, which is much cultivated, and is learnt by them as Latin is with us. It is also used in their daily prayers. Besides these, there are other languages, such as those of Cambaye, Guzerati, of Malacca, and the Berber, who knew by heart the glorious Koran. He lodged in the house of an old woman at Mahal. One day he found her family assembled, and the women weeping as at a funeral. He asked but could not be made to understand the cause, until an interpreter came who told him that the lot had fallen upon the old woman, and that she had one only daughter. Aboul Bererat then said to the old woman, 'I will go to-night in thy daughter's stead.' She was then entirely heartless. So at night, after his ablutions, he was let into the temple. There he sat down and recited the Koran, as is written in the book. He continued his recitation, and the demon, as soon as he came within hearing of the Koran, plunged into the sea. So when it was dawn, the people, who came as was their custom to remove and burn the corpse, found the Maghr\u00e9bin still reciting the Koran. He was conducted to the King, named Chenourazin, who was astonished to hear what had happened. The Maghr\u00e9bin then proposed to him to embrace the true faith, and promised him to receive it. But Chenourazin said, 'Stay with me till next month, and I shall do again as you have now done, and see how the demon will be affected.' The Maghr\u00e9bin refused, and God then sent the heart of the King to receive the true faith. He became Muslim before the end of the month, with his wives, children, and court. At the beginning of the following month the Maghr\u00e9bin was conducted to the idol temple; but the demon came not, and he recited the Koran till the morning, when the Sultan and his subjects arrived, and found him so employed. They then broke the idols and raised the temple to the ground. The people of the island embraced the faith; and such men as who embraced it were called believers also. The Maghr\u00e9bin remained among them, and enjoyed their high esteem; and it was the doctrine of his sect, viz., that of the Imam Malik, which the natives professed. Even at present they respect the Maghr\u00e9bin for his sake. He built a mosque which is known by his name. I have read the following inscription graven in wood on the enclosed pulpit of the grand mosque: 'The Sultan Ahmed Chenourazin has received the true faith at the hands of Aboul Bererat, the Berber, the Maghr\u00e9bin. One night before I knew of these things, when I was free of any occupations, I heard at a sudden pitch crying with loud voice the formula: \"There is no God but God, and God is very great.\" I saw children carrying Korans on their heads, and women rapping the insides of basins and vessels of copper. I was astonished and said, \"What is happening?\" and they replied, \"Do you not see the sea?\" Upon which I looked and saw a kind of large vessel, seemingly, full of lamps and shining-lashes. Thus said to me, \"It is the demon: he shows himself once a month; but when once we have done as you have seen, he returns and does us no harm.\"'\"\u2014(Ibn Batl, Turm ed., vol. IV.)\nPortuguese,\\(^1\\) which some learn for the sake of trade, and by reason of the communication they have with those peoples. In the Atoll of Souadou and towards the south they speak a language hard to understand, rough and barbarous, but still it is the common (Maldiver) language.\"\n\nAppendix. Introduction to Vocabulary. \"I have remarked in many places in my book on the diversity of languages which are current throughout the East Indies; and I shall content myself here with merely repeating that at Goa and its environs, besides the Portuguese, which is the chief one in vogue, there is a native language called Canarine (Canarese); then there is the Malabar, which prevails along the whole length of the Malabar coast, then in Zeilan\\(^2\\) and Cape Comory as far as Goa; for on the coast towards the east they speak generally the Guzerate language, which extends over the continent and the country of the Great Mogul, and is spoken also in Cambaye, Bengale, Bisanagat, and elsewhere, differing only in its dialects and idioms. And in Malacca there is the Malay language, which prevails over a wide extent, even to the isles of the Sound, Sumatra, the Javas, Moluccas, and others. As for the Maldives, they have a language apart, which is spoken only in these islands, and the best is spoken in the northern islands more immediately under the king. For towards the south they speak barbarously, being further from the coast, and from traffic with other nations. Besides this vulgar tongue there is also the Arabic, for the affairs of religion and the sciences, as Latin is with us, and is only spoken and understood by the priests and the learned. I could have made a complete dictionary of the vulgar tongue, as my long residence had given me a sufficiently large and exact acquaintance with it, but, not to weary my readers, I will content myself with giving some of the principal and more necessary words, which will satisfy even the most curious.\"\n\n\\(^1\\) The Portuguese overran the Maldives in the sixteenth century, having discovered them in 1506, the same year in which they first visited Ceylon. The Maldivans afterwards rebelled, and obtained a treaty according them the same independence which they at present enjoy under the British Government.\n\n\\(^2\\) Here again is a proof that Pyrard was acquainted only with Tamil Ceylon.\n### THE MALDIVE ALPHABET (1) COMPARED WITH THE ANCIENT SINHALESE (2)\n\n| Name   | Value | Maldive modern | Maldive ancient | Sinhalese 12th cent |\n|--------|-------|----------------|-----------------|--------------------|\n| 1      | m     |                |                 |                    |\n| 2      | f     |                |                 |                    |\n| 3      | d     |                |                 |                    |\n| 4      | t     |                |                 |                    |\n| 5      | l     |                |                 |                    |\n| 6      | g     |                |                 |                    |\n| 7      | n     |                |                 |                    |\n| 8      | s     |                |                 |                    |\n| 9      | q     |                |                 |                    |\n| 10     | h     |                |                 |                    |\n| 11     | rh    |                |                 |                    |\n| 12     | n     |                |                 |                    |\n| 13     | r     |                |                 |                    |\n| 14     | b     |                |                 |                    |\n| 15     | l     |                |                 |                    |\n| 16     | k     |                |                 |                    |\n| 17     | a     |                |                 |                    |\n| 18     | w     |                |                 |                    |\n\n**Note.** (1) The Maldive alphabet is taken from Christopher's list, carefully compared with his facsimile of a Maldive letter. ([J R. A. S. Vol. VI.](#))\n\n**Note.** (2) The Sinhalese letters are taken from a photograph of the inscription of Nissanka Malla (A.D. 1191.) discovered at Anuradhapura in 1874.\n\n**Note.** (3) The vowel signs are called *fil\u012b*, or severally, *aba*, *\u0101ba*, *iti*, *\u012bti*, *\u0113be*, *\u0113be*, *ul\u016b*, *\u016bl\u016b*, *obo* and *\u014dbo*, *fil\u012b*:\n\n\"Only six consonants can take the sokun (-) over them, and consequently these only can terminate a syllable; they are *a*, *n*, *n*, *rh*, *s*, & *t*. and in this case with the exception of *s*, their sounds receive some modification: *a* becomes *g*; *n* or *n* sometimes take the sound of *ng*; *t* is sounded like a very short *i*; and *rh* merely takes the sound of the following consonant, giving an emphasis to the syllable it terminates: but when *rh* terminates the word it is silent, and appears wholly unnecessary, except for the division it causes, but the natives cannot understand writing without it.\" [Christopher in J. R. A. S. VI. 45.]\n\nThere is no inherent vowel 'a'; accordingly every consonant has either a vowel sign or the sokun: in the latter case, if the consonant cannot take the sokun, it is changed to one which can. The initial vowels are formed by the quasi consonant 'a' with the appropriate vowel sign, and the second of two vowels following a consonant is expressed in the same way, thus 'gai' is written 'g' with the vowel sign 'a' followed by the quasi-consonant 'a' with the sign 'i'.\nP. 142. \"The priests teach the children to read and write the language of the country and the Arabic.\"\n\nP. 205. \"Their studies are to learn to read and write, and to learn their Alcoran, for they are all obliged to have a knowledge of that. The letters are of three kinds: (i.) the Arabic, with some letters and points, which they have added to express their own language; (ii.) another whose characters are peculiar to the Maldive language; (iii.) a third, which is common to Ceylon and a great part of India.\"\n\nIt may be concluded with confidence that the third alphabet here mentioned is not the Sinhalese, but the Tamil. Had Pyrard known the Sinhalese, he could not have said that it was common to a great part of India. Tamil was probably at that time, as it is now in the bazars of Ceylon, the language of trade. We have here another proof that Pyrard knew little of Sinhalese Ceylon. The second alphabet mentioned was doubtless that derived from the Sinhalese, part of which is in use in the Maldives at the present day. Mr. Christopher, in the paper above quoted, has given a list of the Maldive characters ancient and modern, and Mr. Prinsep has given another (J.R.A.S. Beng. vol. v. p. 784), obtained from the captain of a Maldive vessel at Calcutta.\n\nI am enabled to give, on the plate opposite this page, lists of the Sinhalese and Maldivan letters in parallel columns, from which the resemblance between the Old Maldivan and Old Sinhalese will be apparent. The last nine of the old letters have been abandoned in favour of the first nine Arabic numerals. Formerly the Maldivan language was written from left to right, but since the supremacy of Muhammadan literature it has been written from right to left. It will be\n\n1 And so thinks the Portuguese editor, Viagem de P. Pyrard, Nova Goa, 1868, vol. i. p. 169.\n\n2 Mr. Prinsep (J.R.A.S. Beng. vol. v. p. 784) states that modern Maldivan is written from left to right, but with all respect to so great a name, I fear he was mistaken. I will here quote what Christopher (Hom. Geog. Soc. vol. i. p. 64) says in the subjet. \"The different written characters found on tombstones on the Maldives islands are of three kinds. The most ancient are called by the natives Dhokha (letters of the gods) which in all likelihood were used by the first inhabitants, but now the knowledge of them is nearly lost, being confined to a few individuals. In the Southern Atolls a knowledge of this writing appears to have been retained longest, for it is not remembered in the Northern...\"\nhard to find another historical instance of so radical a change.\n\nI am not aware whether the Ceylon Asiatic Society or the Ceylon Government possess any of the Maldive charts, specimens of which would certainly be interesting objects in the New Museum at Colombo. Pyrard (p. 112) says: \"I have seen many Maldive charts with the dangerous reefs accurately described.\" Emerson Tennent mentions that he too saw them.\u00b9\n\nIt is also stated in Mr. Christopher's paper\u00b2 that Sir A. Johnston, late Chief Justice of Ceylon, presented two such charts to the Asiatic Society, as well as a \"copy in the Maldive language of the book of astrology, according to which the navigators decided upon the days of departure from, and the arrival at different places, and the probable success of their voyage.\"\u00b3\n\nones at all, whereas orders are now written at Mal\u00e9 in this character for the inhabitants of the South Atolls. No old manuscripts with this character are preserved. One peculiarity in the alphabet is that some of the consonants change their form according to the various vowel-sounds with which they are united, the construction of the letter being altogether different. This character is written from the left hand. 2. Arabic (most inscriptions are in it). 3. Modern Maldive, called Gabali Tana, written from the right hand, was introduced when the Portuguese garrison was overcome, and Muhammadanism re-established by a chief and men from the Northern Atolls, and is now used throughout the islands. The language spoken is substantially the same in all the Atolls, though the Southern ones have a dialect of their own, and as they possessed a knowledge of the ancient writing longest, it is very probable that their dialect will have the most resemblance to the language of the aborigines, for, in consequence of the intercourse with Bengal and other parts, the language now spoken at Mal\u00e9 is intermixed with many foreign words. There are several kinds of Tana writing; and we are inclined to think that the one at present used was not generally adopted until within the last fifty years, as many tombstones are evidently inscribed in a character differing from the Gabali Tana: the letters at least have a different sound, and the signs for vowels are different.\" The mariners who conversed with Prinsep could not have been some of the few individuals who knew the \"Dewchi Hakura,\" for the letters used by them are clearly the Gabali Tana, containing the nine Arabic numerals. I cannot account for the fact that the few words in Maldive character given in Prinsep's plate are written from left to right, except on the inference drawn from Christopher's assertion of the present use of the Dewchi Hakura. The orders issued to the Southern Atolls may be not only written in the ancient character, but also in the ancient direction, i.e. left to right. If Prinsep's informant was a Government officer, or a man from the Southern Atolls, he may have been able to use both methods. As to the ordinary method there is no doubt. (See the facsimile of a Maldive letter in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Vol. VI.)\n\n\u00b9 Ceylon, vol. i. p. 612, note.\n\u00b2 J.R.A.S. Vol. VI.\n\u00b3 I regret that neither charts nor book can be found at present in the Library of the Royal Asiatic Society. Mr. Vaux, however, entertains hopes of coming upon them in the course of his labours upon the new catalogue.\nBefore proceeding to give Pyrard's vocabulary, I must remind those who peruse it\u2014\n\n(i.) That Pyrard was a Frenchman: the Maldive words must therefore be pronounced as if they were French, in order to sound as Pyrard intended them to sound.\n\n(ii.) That in old French printing \\( r \\) is used only as an initial; elsewhere in a word \\( n \\) is invariably used.\n\nIn my transliteration of the Sinhalese words I have not attempted to keep pace with the most modern philologists. Their rules change so often, that I may be pardoned when I confess that I do not know exactly what they are at present. To take the word \"Sinhalese\" as an instance; first we had Singhalese; Mr. Childers introduced Sinhalese, then Sinha-lese; and lastly Dr. Goldschmidt wrote Sinhalese.\n\nTo show the resemblance better to the words given by Pyrard, who (being French) uses \\( r \\), I have written the Sinhalese \\( r-w \\) in some cases \\( r \\), though in my opinion, if we wish to give an equivalent which shall represent the Sinhalese letter \\( c-u \\) in English speech, we should use the letter \\( w \\). Take as an instance the word for \"to become\": does \\( venac \\) represent the Sinhalese pronunciation? or does \\( wenac \\)? or the word for \"a tank,\" does \\( vera \\) so well as \\( weva \\)? It seems to me that the great object is to transliterate according to the correct sound of the language in question, and that we should avoid the use of letters which not only fail to give that sound, but often give quite another.\n\nIt will be observed that Christopher invariably writes \\( f \\) in place of Pyrard's \\( p \\), when they give the same words, in fact that there is no Maldivan \\( p \\) in the alphabet given by Christopher; the Persian letter being borrowed when required. The \\( ph \\), however, of the ancient writing, is clearly the Sinhalese \\( p \\), which has degenerated not only into \\( f \\), but also in many cases, according to Christopher, to the mere aspirate.\\(^1\\)\n\n\\(^1\\) See plate opposite p. 183.\nI.

On the other hand, those which are not compounds of dolos are altered values of the ordinary Sinhalese\n| English       | Maldive | Sinhalese |\n|---------------|---------|-----------|\n| twenty-four   | passe   | vissa (20)|\n| thirty-six    | tindolos| tun, dolos|\n| forty-eight   | panas   | panas (50)|\n| sixty         | passedolos| pas, dolos|\n| seventy-two   | (omitted)| \u2014         |\n| eighty-four   | addolos | hata, dolos|\n| ninety-six    | ya\u00b9     | siya (100)|\n| thousand, or  | assa    | d\u0101ha, d\u0101sa(1000)|\n| 10 times 96   | lacqua  | lanka     |\n| million, or\u00b2  |         | lakshaya  |\n| times 1000    |         |           |\n\n| house        | gu\u00e9     | g\u0113        |\n| temple       | mesquite\u00b3| miski     |\n| kitchen      | vadique | \u2014         |\n| door         | dore    | doru      |\n| house-fence  | gouety  | \u2014         |\n| wall         | paore   | fauru     |\n| guest        | nasile\u2074 | \u2014         |\n\n| precious stones | es\u2075     | \u2014         |\n| diamond       | alimas\u2076 | \u2014         |\n| ruby          | yacouth\u2077| \u2014         |\n| emerald       | akika\u2078  | \u2014         |\n\ndecimal numbers. Yet it is strange that Pyrrard could make mistakes with numbers so low as twenty-four and forty-eight, which by analogy ought to be dedolos and h\u0101radolos. From the letter given by Christopher, and from the Sultan's title (v.i.), it seems that the Maldivans count much by dozens; indeed, Christopher (Trans. Bom. Geog. Soc. vol. i. p. 54, etc.) says, \"they reckon by dozens as we do by tens;\" but they have not abandoned altogether the decimal system. If, however, passe and panas really stand for twenty-four and forty-eight, it will be interesting to know the Maldive for twenty and fifty. Christopher (Maldive letter in J.R.A.S. Vol. VI.) has salis, forty = Sin. hatalis. Salis is, I believe, also used in Elu.\n\n\u00b9 Ibn Batuta (Paris ed. vol. iv. p. 121) has sy\u0101h 100, f\u0101l 700, cotta 12,000, and bostan 100,000. He uses these numbers in speaking of packages of cowries.\n\n\u00b2 Milion ou diz fois mil. Perhaps he means that the Maldive lacqua corresponds to milion, as a vast and not very definite number.\n\n\u00b3 Ar. masjid, Pers. maski. The use of the more Persian form tends to confirm the Maldive tradition, according to which the islanders were converted to Mohammedanism by Persians from Tabriz (see Trans. Bom. Geog.

Maldive Words and Expressions used in the Course of Pyrard's Narrative.\n\n(i.) The Atolls.\n\nAtollons (p. 107), Atolls, the Maldive name, Chr. atolu.\n\nThe thirteen Atolls in order from the North are:\n\n1. Tilla dou matis (p. 111), the northernmost Atoll, called by the Portuguese \"Cabexa des las ilhas,\" the Maldive name having the same signification.\n\n2. Mille doue madoue.\n3. Padypolo.\n4. Malosmadou.\n5. Ariatollen. Comp. the Ari islands.\n6. Male atollon, the Atoll containing Male, the royal island.\n7. Poulisdous, now Ph\u0101lidu.\n8. Molucques. Comp. Molucca.\n9. Nillandous.\n10. Collomadous, now Collomandu.\n11. Adoumatis.\n12. Souadou. Also called Ouadou.\n13. Addou and Poua Molucque. Two Atolls, but counted politically as one, and generally called Addou.\n\n(ii.) Islands.\n\nPouladou (p. 60), at the N. of the atoll Ph\u0101lidu.\n\n1 This division into thirteen Atolls is political rather than physical; thus Tilla dou matis includes what is really the northernmost atoll, Heawandu Pholo, and does not include Mille doue madoue, though both form one long straggling atoll intersected by no deep soundings. Malcolm Atoll (so called by the English surveyors) is taken to belong to Mille doue Madoue: Horsburgh Atoll to Malosmadou. Male has three atolls; Ari and Addou each two. Ibn Batuta gives the following as the names of some of the provinces: 1. P\u0101lipur, 2. Cannalous, 3. Mahal, 'which gives its name to all the islands,' 4. Tel\u0101dib, 5. Caraidou, 6. Teim, 7. T\u00e9l\u00e9dommety, 8. H\u00e9ledommety, 9. Bereidou, 10. Candacal, 11. Molouc, 12. Souweid. These do not seem to be given in any order, but Mahal (Male), Caraidou (Cardiva, the island N. of Male atoll which gives its name to the Channel), T\u00e9l\u00e9dommety (Tilladamati), Molouc (Moluk) and Souweid (Suadiva) are easily recognizable. The Maldives generally are called Dh\u012bbat Al Mahal by Ibn Batuta [see Ibn Batoutah by Defremery and Sanguinetti, Paris, 1868, vol. iv.]. The Maldivans at the present day write Mahalidib [J.A.S. Beng. vol. v. plate 49, at p. 794].\n\n2 The word 'dou,' 'dous,' or 'doue,' which occurs so often in the following names, = island, 'dues' or 'duar' = islanders. Sans. duipa, Sin. duwa.\n\n3 These atolls with Suadiva were sometimes considered as a sub-kingdom, apart from the other atolls. The deposed king who lived at Cochin entitled himself 'King of the Maldive Islands and of the three atolls of Cuaydu' (see pp. 199, 200).\n\n4 The number of the islands has been variously stated. The Maldive king claimed to rule 12,000 isles: the two Muhammadans of the 9th century give the number 1900; Ibn Batuta says 'about 2000': while Juan de Barros derives the\nPandio or Pandou\u00e9 (p. 71), probably Fa\u00efnu, the chief island of the northern division of Malcomadou (see Adm. Chart, 1868).\nTouladou (p. 83), small island ten leagues from Pandio.\nMacnemadou (p. 86), small island belonging to the High Admiral, between Pandio and Male.\nBandos (p. 97), near Male.\nMidou\u00e9 (p. 263), in the Atoll Nilandoune.\nGuaradou (p. 268), ten leagues N. of Male.\nGama (p. 261), in the Atoll Sonadou; a fortress was built here against the Portuguese. (Cf. Sin. gama 'a village.'\nMuspillapayou (p. 291), an island belonging to the Queen, forty leagues N. of Male; cf. Sin. Palus-is para, the correct name of the ruined city known as Pollonarouwe.\nPollonouye (p. 316), an island 120 leagues S. of the Maldives, known only traditionally. The story goes that some Maldivian sailors once landed there, but were obliged to leave it, owing to the devils who visibly tormented them. The king sent several times to rediscover it, the expeditionary force being assisted by the presence of a number of magicians, who were to sign a treaty with the devils for colonization, but it was not sighted again, owing to the difficulty of sailing due south against monsoon and current. One of the Peros Banhos group of the Chagos Archipelago, situated Lat. 5\u00b0 20' S., is named Poule in the charts. The most southern Maldivian atoll (Addu) is in lat. 0\u00b0 40' S.\nCardoue (p. 116), an island which gives its name to the chief passage of the Atolls between Ariatollen and the Male Atoll.\nBy later geographers spelt Cordoue. One of the islands at the N. of Ceylon is also called Karatiru (named Amsterdam by the Dutch).\nHedou (p. 318), an island of the Atoll Adoumatie.\nOutoume (p. 343), the northernmost isle. (Sin. antume, Sans. uittama.)\n\nname from Mal, the Malabar (?) for 1000, and dua, islands. Capt. Owen believed the total number was three or four times 12,000 (J.R.G.S. vol. ii. p. 84). It would be a difficult and unnecessary labour to attempt to count them even with our complete surveys. The Admiralty charts, however, corrected up to 1866 enable us to fix the total number of inhabited islands, spread over the atolls shown on the latter, at nine. There is no question of assessing even the total population; it has been estimated at 150,000 to 200,000 (Chapton, etc., p. 165); but 20,000 would, I imagine, be nearer the mark. That of Male, as I am informed by a sailor, who was shipwrecked there last year, on the authority of the present Sultan's brother, is 2000. Lieut. Powell found 766 people in the seven inhabited islands of Huvadu atoll (J.A.S. Beng. vol. iv. p. 319).\n\n| Atoll | Inhabited Islands |\n|-------|-------------------|\n| 1     | Thilafushi        |\n| 2     | Malhulamady       |\n| 3     | Paddiphalo        |\n| 4     | Malcomadou        |\n| 5     | Ari               |\n| 6     | Ma\u00ef\u00e9             |\n| 7     | Phaldu            |\n\n| Atoll | Inhabited Islands |\n|-------|-------------------|\n| 8     | Male              |\n| 9     | Nilandou          |\n| 10    | Collemadou        |\n| 11    | Adurati           |\n| 12    | Sundiva           |\n| 13    | Addu              |\n\nTotal ... ... 175\nMalicut (p. 345), a small island thirty-five leagues N. of the Maldives, inhabited by people of Maldive race and language; it was formerly under the Maldive raj, but was given to a relative by a former king.

Chr. says, 'After the Sultan's name all communications in writing have the following expressions, I suppose denoting the dignity and importance of the monarch, but unexplainable at the present day\u2014Kulasing dura kutiri bowana maha radung.' The last two words, I apprehend, are maha raja. The Portuguese editor of Pyrard has this note, 'The Christian king of these islands who lived at Cochin (being dethroned) was entitled thus: Dom Manoel por gra\u00e7a de Deus rei das ilhas de\nMaldiva e de tres Patanas de Cuaydu e de sete ilhas de Pullobay, da conquista e naviga\u00e7\u00e3o de toda a costa brava de Sumatra e do Estreito de Manacuma, etc.'\u2014Documento de 1560.\" Patana is another word for Atoll according to this editor.\n\nRascan et Sultan (p. 257), \"Rascan is the ordinary term for the king, but Sultan is used as his signature after Mohammedan usage.\"\n\nMoucouris (p. 221), 'Docteurs et savants' without office, except that they assist the Pandiar in deciding appeals from the Naybe's court.

The political connexion, which has been incidentally alluded to, is slight and undefined. On the occasion of the annual embassy from the Sultan to the Governor of Ceylon, the former claims the protection and favour of the British Government; the Governor on the other hand stipulates for succour to Europeans shipwrecked at the Atolls. It is well understood by the islanders that their independence rests upon compliance in this respect. In Pyrard\u2019s day a wreck became the property of the Sultan; similar law applied to a ship whose captain died at the islands, and nefarious means were occasionally adopted to expedite that event. Such acts are attributable to the cupidity of the rulers, the natives themselves being reputed in all ages peaceable and humane. In modern times the wholesome dread of English power has induced the Sultan to render all necessary protection to the lives of those shipwrecked on his coasts. It seems, however, to be still thought that, after the occurrence of a wreck, the captain has lost all right to his goods and cargo. When the \u201cLiffey\u201d was wrecked on the Nillandu Atoll in August last year, the people would in no way assist the master to recover any of the cargo, \u201cthey could not do so without express leave of the Sultan,\u201d though they provided boats, pilots, and provisions for the conveyance of the crew to Mal\u00e9. This is hardly a satisfactory state of things.\n\nAnother subject to which the attention of the Ceylon Government should be turned is that of Maldive trade, which all accounts describe as being in a state of decline. In the days of Ibn Batuta and Pyrard, the islands enjoyed great prosperity of traffic and productiveness. But, as is too often the case, peace and plenty have given place to listlessness and scarcity. The cultivation of fruit and vegetables is generally disregarded; and the supply of grain, nearly all of which is imported, is precarious and insufficient. Even at Mal\u00e9 last year, rice was not procurable by the sailors of the \u201cLiffey,\u201d who had to subsist for three weeks on cocoanuts and fish. The islands used to produce, and could now\nproduce in abundance most kinds of tropical fruit and vegetables, while the trade in coconuts, coir and oil, in fish and tortoise-shell, arising from 175 inhabited islands, might be vastly increased.\n\nLastly, attention should be directed to Maldive literature and archaeology. There are said to be but few old MSS. in existence; but the islands abound with inscriptions on walls and gravestones of many ages, in Persian and Arabic, in the Dewehi Hakura, and in two kinds of the Gabali Tana.\n\nMeasures should be taken by the Ceylon Government without delay to render more intimate the connexion with its only dependency, and, overcoming the jealousy of the Maldive ruler, if any still exist, to extend to his subjects some of the benefits of Ceylon civilization. Lord Londonderry, when Secretary of State for the Colonies, is said to have consented to the establishment of a permanent British Resident at Mal\u00e9, but the promise has never been carried out. Considering the present condition of the islands, and their reputed unhealthy climate, no European need be subjected to so severe a banishment; but it may be suggested that a civilian of tact and experience, accompanied by a competent Sinhalese secretary, should be sent for three or four months in successive years to report upon the government, trade, and archaeology of the Maldives. The Government steamer might also make perhaps two visits a year to the Atolls, without seriously interfering with its Ceylon duties. If some such measures are taken, much advantage may be predicted both for Ceylon and for its dependency, the innumerable Maldives.\nART. IX.\u2014On Tibeto-Burman Languages. By Capt. C. J. F. S. Forbes, of the Burmese Civil Commission.\n\nThe term 'Tibeto-Burman' has latterly crept into use as a convenient designation of a very large family of languages which appear more or less to approximate to each other. They are those which Max M\u00fcller classes as Gangetic and Lohitic, names which, with all due reference to the learned Professor, really have little relevant meaning in this case.\n\nUnder no other head perhaps is so vast a number of dialects included. Max M\u00fcller gives forty-five, and this only includes the dialects known and recorded; whereas it is stated that, among the N\u00e1ga tribes, different dialects exist in almost every separate village, which would increase the number ad infinitum. It may be as well to state, while referring to Prof. Max M\u00fcller's list,\u00b9 that he has erroneously entered under the class 'Lohitic' a language called 'Tunglhu' in Tenasserim. By this is evidently meant the 'Toungthoo,' which however is a dialect of the Karen, which the Professor does not, and rightly so, class as Lohitic. Whether it is really necessary to preserve this long nomenclature is a question. Logan has concisely described the process of the manufacture of these multifarious dialects.\n\n\"Perpetual aggressions and frequent conquests, extirpations of villages, and migrations, mark the modern history of nearly all these Tibeto-Burman tribes, and of the different clans of the same tribe. Their normal condition and relations, while extremely favourable to the maintenance of a minute division of communities and dialects, are opposed to any long preservation of their peculiarities. We find the\n\n\u00b9 Science of Language, vol. i. p. 452.\nsame tribe separating into clans and villages permanently at war with each other. Kuki fleeing from Kuki, Singpho from Singpho, Abor from Abor. We can thus understand how, in such a country, and before the Aryans filled the plains, the lapse of a few centuries would transform a colony from a barbarous Sifan clan, descending the Himalaya by a single pass, into a dozen scattered tribes, speaking as many dialects, and no longer recognizing their common descent.\"\n\n\"Within the mountainous parts of the limits of the modern kingdom of N\u00e9pal there are thirteen distinct and strongly marked dialects spoken. They are extremely rude, owing to the people who speak them having crossed the snows before learning dawned on Tibet, and the physical features of their new home having tended to break up and enfeeble the common speech they brought with them. At present the several tribes or clans can hardly speak intelligibly to each other.\"\n\nWe shall have to contemplate a similar state of things in the country lying east of the Brahmapootra river, and along the chain of mountains that hem in the independent kingdom of Burma on the north and west.\n\nThe affinity between the Burman and Tibetan races has been sufficiently recognized not to require detailed proof. The connexion and relation of the minor tribes to the Burmese has been in some cases allowed, in others left an open question requiring farther investigation.\n\nDr. Mason enumerates eleven Burmese tribes \"of unquestionably common origin,\" and adds several others whom he considers as doubtful. They are as under:\n\n| Burmese | Doyungweel |\n|---------|------------|\n| 1. Burmese | Rakhynse or Kukoon. |\n| 2. Arakanese | Kumis or Komes. |\n| 3. Mru. | Kyuns. |\n| 4. Kanaus. | Koons. |\n| 5. Toungooza. | Sak. |\n| 6. Tunjerry. | Mru. |\n| 7. Yaus or Yos. | Shendoom (or Kukis). |\n| 8. Yebams or Zebains. | |\n| 9. Pyus. | |\n| 10. Kauos. | |\n| 11. Danus. | |\n\n* Journ. Ind. Arch. vol. ii. p. 62. * Asiatic Researches, vol. xvi. p. 409.\nWe may very shortly dispose of several in this list. The term 'Mugs' is simply an epithet applied to the Arracanese by the people of Bengal, unknown to the Burmese language; the meaning of the word cannot even be ascertained, and to enter it as a tribal name in a scientific list is like including the 'Yankees' as one of the nations of America, distinct from the Americans. It is rendered still more absurd when Phayre derives it \"probably from a tribe of Brahmins termed 'Magas,' said to have emigrated eastward from Bengal;\" to which Mason adds, \"Magas looks very much like Magos, the priest of the Medes.\" Was this meant in earnest? Next we have the 'Kanyans,' who are traditionally said to have been one of the tribes that were incorporated to form the 'Burman' nation; where they now exist, or what is their language, it would be a puzzle to ascertain. The same applies to the 'Pyus,' said to have been the tribe inhabiting the present district of Prome, but now as unknown there as the Trinobantes are in Middlesex. Toungoo or Toungnoo was one of the petty kingdoms founded by younger branches of the Burman royal family, as the head of the race grew weak, and though the main body of the population was Burmese, it was very mixed, and has no more claim to rank as a separate tribe than has that of any other Burman town.\n\nThe 'Tavoyers,' or people of Tavoy, might, in virtue of a very peculiar dialect, claim tribal rank; but they are only a colony of the Arracanese, as is stated in their traditions and confirmed by their language, which has since become corrupted by Shan or Siamese influence. But there is no reason for separating them either ethnologically or linguistically from their parent stock.\n\nThe Yaus, Yebaings, Kados, and Danus, are recognized by the Burmans proper as being the wilder and more primitive branches of their race; but, unfortunately, we have no trustworthy specimens of their dialects from which to form conclusions. The dialects of the Yaus and Yebaings are certainly unintelligible to any Burmans, and the numerals of\nthe latter show no affinity to any of their neighbours. They are:\n\n1. taomak.\n2. taon-toung.\n3. baloungma.\n4. lah bee.\n5. hgya hook.\n\n6. look-kay.\n7. tha khan.\n8. toung moo.\n9. ngna loung.\n10. loong-teek.\n\nMason says the Danus \"speak the Burmese language in a rude nasal and guttural dialect.\"\n\nIn the absence of further information we can only conclude that these are some of the many petty clans of kindred race which the force of circumstances amalgamated into a political unit as the Burman nation, these retaining in a greater degree their primitive characteristics.\n\nWe are now reduced to the two great branches of the Myanma or Burmese race; the Burmans proper, and the Arracanese. Should these be so clearly and absolutely divided?\n\nThe traditions or histories of both nations give us the same account, that, on the death of the founder of the first Burman kingdom, his two sons disputed the succession to the throne, and one of them led a part of the people to the westward across the mountains, and established a separate kingdom in Arracan, driving out the savage occupants of the country. According to this there is no ethnological distinction originally between the Arracanese and the Burmans proper. What is the divergence in language?\n\nThe Burmans acknowledge that the oldest and purest form of their language has been preserved in Arracan. This is borne out by the evidence of the dialect itself, which retains the original pronunciation of words which are subject to permutation of the letters in Burmese, and which also uses many words in a sense now obsolete in Burma proper. The structure of the two dialects is however precisely the same, and their divergence is not more than exists between the English of Somersetshire and Middlesex.\n\nThe Arracanese and Burmese differ in two essential points; namely, that, in the former, words are pronounced phonetic-\n\n1 Collected by Capt. Forbes in the Shwegyesh District.\nally or nearly so, while, in the latter, several letters acquire in certain combinations entirely different values. Thus in all the Indo-Chinese languages the vowel 'a' being inherent in every consonant where no other form vowel is expressed, the combination 'k'k' would be pronounced truly in Arracanese 'k\u0101k,' but in Burmese both the sound of the inherent vowel and of the final consonant would be entirely changed, and the above combination would be pronounced 'ket.' In the same way 'ap' is pronounced 'at';\u2014'am,' 'an';\u2014'et' 'eik';\u2014and so in several other forms, whereas in Arracanese these retain their natural phonetic values.\n\nSecondly the Arracanese uses many words and forms of expression which have either become obsolete in Burmese, or have acquired another meaning. To instance one striking case. The Arracanese and several of the Hill tribes use the word 'l\u00e1' for 'go,' while this in Burmese means 'to come,' and could not possibly signify 'go,' but we find that in Burmese this same root 'la,' with the heavy accent, means (to use Judson's definition), \"to proceed from a starting place to some boundary,\" although it is never found in actual use in this sense. The Arracanese has thus retained the root in both its forms and senses as 'to come' and 'to go,' while the Burmese has rejected its application in the latter sense. The Arracanese dialect is also much more guttural and harsher in sound than the Burmese, which delights in softening and smoothing over any difficulties of pronunciation. This is especially remarkable in the letter \u1e5b, which is really an r, and so pronounced by the Arracanese, but is softened into a y by the Burmans. The following examples will afford the means of contrasting, by a few simple sentences, the peculiar features of the two dialects, and will show how little real difference there is between them. The upper line gives the Burmese, the middle the English translation, and the lower the Arracanese.\n\n1. kyunop-do, or kyun-do.\n   we    we\n   akynanop-ro,   akyuan-ro.\n\nThe Burmese omits the inherent 'a' in 'kyu'n' which the\nArracanese fully gives. The plural affix is 'do' in the first and 'ro' in the second.\n\n2. nga-do.\n   we\n   nga-ro.\n\n3. nga-do nepan thwa leim mee\n   we to-morrow go will.\n   nga-ro manet-ka ta mee lo.\n\n4. ming bey go thwa mee lai,\n   you where go will? (Where are you going?)\n   mang zago la hpo lai.\n\nThe Arracanese here gives the true sound of the inherent vowel in the form 'm'ng' which the Burmese converts into an 'i' 'mung.' Instead of the Burmese 'bey' 'what,' 'where,' the Arracanese has an old form 'za,' now obsolete in Burma. We find 'hi' 'go' for the Burmese 'thwa,' as mentioned above, and in place of the verbal affix 'mee' the Arracanese uses 'hpo.'\n\n5. Ning nga yeik leim mee,\n   Tom I beat will.\n   Nang go nga that leim mee.\n\nHere the word 'that' is employed by the Arracanese in the sense merely of 'to beat,' 'to strike,' but in Burmese it would mean only 'to kill,' used in such an expression as the above; yet in one case it is still retained in Burmese in the sense of 'to strike,' namely, with respect to the act of striking in boxing.\n\nThese examples display the chief points of divergence between the two dialects, and show that the Arracanese has preserved the older and purer form of the language, while the Burmese has been greatly subject to phonetic decay or corruption. This is, doubtless, in some degree owing to the different social and political history of the two countries. Arracan has been much more isolated, and the people have preserved their race purity to a greater extent. Their intercourse has chiefly been with the distinct and alien Hindu race, whose influence, though in some things great, has little affected their language or their blood. Burma, on the con-\ntrary, has been subject to long and frequent periods of domination by nations of kindred origin, the Shans, and the Mons, and to close intercourse with them and also with the Chinese, throughout her history. The Burmans have received a vast amount of foreign and yet kindred element into their nation, which has amalgamated with and been insensibly affected by it; while the Arracanese and their Hindu neighbours have remained in contact, but, like oil and water, without fusion.\n\nWe have thus reduced Mason's list of eleven Burmese tribes to six ascertained varieties of dialect, and it is probable that for a general classification of languages, which does not deal with mere provincialisms, the term 'Burmese' should be made to include the Arracanese, Kados, and Danoos. The Yau and Yebaing, as far as we know of them, must still be kept distinct.\n\nThere remain the 'doubtful' tribes, all of whom, except the Kakhyens, inhabit the mountainous country lying between Bengal and Burma, generally known as the Arracan range, whence these tribes are known as the 'Arracan Hill Tribes.' Logan often terms them 'Yoma tribes,' but 'Yoma' is simply a Burmese word meaning any mountain range, and therefore a misnomer if applied thus specifically. Of late years our knowledge of these tribes, and others in similar positions in the North-East part of Bengal, has much increased, and their mutual relationship and connexion with the Tibeto-Burman family more clearly established. Of all these tribes the Burmese (including their Arracanese brethren) alone have any literature, or possess any probable traditions of their origin and early history. According to Burmese traditions, the founders of their race and nation came from the West, from the valley of the Ganges, into their present seats, which they found occupied previously by the wilder tribes who are now confined to the mountain tracts. They even claim a Rajpoot origin for the people, while the royal family pretend to trace their descent from the sacred Solar and Lunar dynasties of Hindustan. This myth has generally been ascribed to national vanity and arrogance, and com-\npletely ignored. Sir A. Phayre is quite opposed to the theory, and says: \"The supposed immigration of any of the royal races of Gangetic India to the Irrawaddy in the sixth century B.C., or even later, will appear very improbable. I see no reason for doubting that they (the Burman tribes) found their way into the valley of the Irrawaddy by what is now the track of the Chinese caravans from Yunnan, which track debouches at Bamo on the river.\" That is to say, Sir A. Phayre places the original domicile of the Burman race in the South-Western provinces of China. Whether he would now deliberately uphold this opinion is doubtful, and, with all respect for so great an authority, it appears utterly without foundation. There seems no reason why we should peremptorily reject the Burman tradition in so far as it traces their migratory route from the Gangetic valley. Their Rajput origin is of course an invention of courtly historians of a date after the introduction of Buddhism; but, in the absence of any clear evidence to the contrary, it appears more reasonable to follow the lines of ancient tradition as far as they agree with probabilities. What little evidence on the subject we can collect seems also to support this idea.\n\nThe Burmans represent themselves as the last comers in the country, and state that when they penetrated into Arracan, they found the country occupied by savage monsters termed by them Beloos, whom they expelled; an evidently figurative account of the wilder tribes whom they found in prior possession of the soil. Sir A. Phayre and other authorities consider it as most probable that such actually was the case. We should then have, after the first wave of the Mon-Annam immigration, an irruption of a number of petty savage tribes, whose representatives and descendants at the present day occupy the Hill tracts, in much the same state as their forefathers were.\n\nThe Hill tribes of Arracan are, according to the Administration Reports, the Khyengs, the Kamis or Kunis, the\n\n1 History of the Burman Race, Journ. Asiat. Soc. Bengal.\nMrus, the Sak, the Kyaus or Chyaus, the Anoos, the Toungthas, the Shendoos or Kukis, and two or three other petty tribes, of which only a few families exist; but it is probable that a better acquaintance with them would show that these are only clannish divisions of some other tribe.\n\nThese tribes, if we allow the evidence of language, of manners, and of physical characteristics, are closely allied to the N\u00e1ga tribes of Eastern Bengal, and to the Abors and Mishmis of Ass\u00e1m. It is generally believed that these or kindred races of Turanian origin occupied the valley of Gangetic India before the advancing Aryan invaders drove them from the plains to their present mountain fastnesses. All these tribes doubtless formed the first wave of the later Turanian emigration from the Central Asian plateau, the Bhotian and Burman races being their successors. To them also would seem to belong those whom Hodgson calls the \"broken tribes\" of Nep\u00e1l, the Chepang, Vayu and Kusunda. These latter tribes afford an important and curious link in the chain of evidence, which thus stretches from the Arracan Hills far away to the westward, to the Kali and Gunduk rivers in West Nep\u00e1l.\n\nHodgson has clearly shown the connexion of the Chepangs with the Tibetan and Lhopa races, and has traced the affinities in these dialects in a pretty full vocabulary of the Chepang language. But by far the greater number of coincident words are derived from roots common to all or nearly all the cognate dialects of Tibet, Nep\u00e1l and High Asia. Thus variations of the simple roots for such words as eye, fire, day, moon, dog, fish, sun, road, and several others which he gives, are common to a dozen other dialects besides the Chepang and Tibetan or Lh\u00f3pa, and are found in Nep\u00e1l, in Sifan, in Burma, in Siam, and do not prove a closer affinity between the Chepangs and the Lhopas, than between the former and the N\u00e9wars, the Manyak or the Burmans.\n\nBut when we compare the widely sundered languages of the Chepangs and of the Hill Tribes of Arracan, we are at\nonce struck by the identity sometimes of roots, often of actual words, which are not to be found in any of the cognate Tibeto-Himalayan or Sifanese dialects. In some cases the root is common to others of these languages, but the particular form in the Chepang is only found in the Khyeng, the Kumi, or the Karen.\n\nSome examples are given below for comparison, there are many other words in which a common root may be found in other dialects:\n\n| Chepang | Arracan Tribes |\n|---------|---------------|\n| 1.

In 9 \u2018ku\u2019 in Sak means \u2018head,\u2019 \u2018ku-mi\u2019 is therefore \u2018head-hair.\u2019 In 11 the first root in each dialect signifies \u2018breast,\u2019 the second \u2018water,\u2019 milk is therefore literally \u2018breast-water.\u2019\n\nThis resemblance between dialects separated by so great a\ndistance geographically, and by centuries of time, is surely in itself sufficient to prove the affinity of the tribes speaking them. Hodgson has conjectured that these 'broken tribes' between the Kali and Gunduk rivers may have been separated from their kindred and driven westward. We may also suppose that at an early period the whole sub-Himalayan region was occupied by tribes allied to the Chepangs and Arracan mountaineers, who were cut asunder and driven out of central Nep\u00e1l by the incursion of the Newar races at present possessing the country, some 1000 to 1300 years ago, which is the date Hodgson assigns to this event.\n\nMany years have elapsed since Mr. Hodgson, by his researches, indicated \"that the sub-Him\u00e1layan races are all closely affiliated, and are all of northern origin;\" it would only be quoting from his well-known papers to enter further on this subject. We have linked the Western Hill Tribes of Burma with the widely sundered Chepangs and Kusundas of Nep\u00e1l, but a vast gap exists between the Gunduk river in Nep\u00e1l and the eastern bank of the Brahmap\u00fatra, where we meet the next representatives of this race.\n\nHere, in the vast tract of mountainous country stretching from the G\u00e1ro Hills along the southern part of As\u00e1m, and bordering on Munipur and Burma, is the home of those multifold tribes and clans, of which the greater proportion is classed together under the term 'N\u00e1g\u00e1.' Here also are the G\u00e1ros, Kh\u00e1sias, Kacharis, Kukis, Singphos, and several other tribes whose mutual relation to each other does not yet seem quite determined. When we compare their vocabularies with each other, they exhibit singular affinities, and all that we know of them confirms the supposition that they form but one great race, of which the tribes in the Arracan Mountains of Burma are but the branches. One of the best authorities on the N\u00e1g\u00e1 races, Captain J. Butler, affirms: \"Our late explorations have clearly ascertained that the great N\u00e1g\u00e1 race does undoubtedly cross over the main watershed dividing the waters which flow north into the Brahmap\u00fatra, from those flowing south into the Ir\u00e1wad\u00ed; and they have also\nfurnished very strong grounds for believing that in all probability it extends as far as the banks of the Kaiendwen (N\u00e1mton\u00e1i or Ningthi) river, the great western tributary of the Ir\u00e1w\u00e1di. Indeed, there is room to believe that further explorations may, ere long, lead us to discover that the Kakhyan and Khyen (often pronounced Kashin and Chin) tribes, spoken of by former writers (Pemberton, Yule, Hannay, etc.), are but offshoots of this one great race.\"\n\nIn 1835 Captain Hannay, with the little knowledge then possessed of these people, identified \"the Khyens with the N\u00e1g\u00e1s of the As\u00e1m mountains.\" In comparing the vocabularies of these races, and drawing conclusions from them, we must remember that the peculiar character of these dialects, and the social conditions of the people speaking them, constitute an important element in the comparison. Max M\u00fcller truly says: \"No doubt the evidence on which the relationship of French and Italian, of Greek and Latin, of Lithuanian and Sanskrit, of Hebrew and Arabic, has been established, is the most satisfactory; (but) to call for the same evidence in support of the homogeneousness of the Turanian languages, is to call for evidence which, from the nature of the case, it is impossible to supply. . . . The Turanian languages allow of no grammatical petrifications like those on which the relationship of the Aryan and Semitic families is chiefly founded. If they did, they would cease to be what they are; they would be inflectional, not agglutinative. If languages were all of one and the same texture, they might be unravelled, no doubt, with the same tools.\"\n\nIn the case of the languages and dialects about to be mentioned their greatest peculiarity is their mutability. We are told of offshoot villages from a clan being formed across two or three mountain ranges distant from the parent valley, and in three generations the language of their grandfathers has become unintelligible to the colonists. Among civilized tribes, before we assumed any racial connexion on the mere evidence of affinities discovered in their languages, we\n\n1 Journ. Asiat. Soc. Bengal, 1875, vol. xiv. p. 393.\n2 Science of Language, vol. ii. p. 25.\nshould naturally seek to ascertain in the first place whether any historic connexion or intercourse had ever existed between them, by which they might have mutually influenced each other's speech. But among these rude and savage tribes, to be separate is to be hostile; each village, or at least each clan, is too isolated, and too jealous of its neighbours, to borrow from them any appreciable portion of their language. Where then we find an unmistakable affinity of speech, we may safely suppose an affinity of race and a common origin. But when we find a number of tribes differing from each other in dialect, preserving amongst them a large number of words or roots, which we discover again among certain other tribes separated by a great distance, and with whom they have had no intercourse for ages, and these words not common to all of them, but some here and some there, the evidence of their mutual relationship is rendered much stronger. Such is the case with the two groups of languages or dialects we shall now compare. The first consists of the Hill Tribes of Arracan, viz. the Khyeng, the Kami, the Kumi, the Mru and the Sak. The second consists of the Garo, the Kachari, the various N\u00e1g\u00e1 tribes, the tribes of the Munip\u00fari valley, the Abor and Mishmi of As\u00e1m, and the Singpho. The words are taken for the sake of easy reference entirely from Hunter's Dictionary and the Rev. N. Brown's Tables. It will be seen that the corresponding roots are not found in all the dialects alike, but some in one, some in another, and it is singular that a large number of them are found to correspond with the Mru and Sak tribes that have been long under Burmese influence, and are said to be of the \"same lineage as the Burmese.\"\u00b9\n\nOnly a sufficient number of words to serve as a fair example are quoted, and all words which are common to the Burmese and other Tibetan dialects are omitted. Such are, boat, day, fire, fish, hog, moon, road and many others which belong to the mother-language of all the Tibeto-Burman dialects.\n\n\u00b9 Mason.\nThe first three numerals are either peculiar to each dialect by itself, or are founded on Tibetan roots, then follow:\n\n| Arracan | Naga, etc. | Burmese |\n|---------|------------|---------|\n| Four.   | ma-li      | me-li   | lay     |\n|         | ta-li      | a-li    |         |\n|         | pa-lu      | pha-li  |         |\n| Five.   | pang-gn\u00e1   | pha-ng\u00e1 | ng\u00e1     |\n|         | ta-ng\u00e1     | ba-ng\u00e1  |         |\n| Six.    | ta-ru      | ta-ruk  | khyouk  |\n| Seven.  | tha-ni     | the-ne  | koh-hnit|\n| Eight.  | sat        | i-sat   | shit    |\n| Nine.   | ta-ku      | ta-ku   | k\u00f3      |\n| Ten.    | si-su      | si      | ts\u00e9     |\n| Twenty. | h\u00fan        | kh\u00fan    | nhit-ts\u00e9|\n| Arrow.  | to-li-mal\u00e1 | mal\u00e1    | hmy\u00e1    |\n|         | li         | l\u00e1      |         |\n| Bird.   | ta-v\u00e1      | v\u00e1      | hnget   |\n|         | ta-wu      | wu      |         |\n| Blood.  | a-thi      | a-thi   | thway   |\n| Cow.    | tha-muk    | sa-muk  | nua     |\n| Ear.    | ka-nhan    | kha-na  | na      |\n|         | a-ka-na    | akhana  |         |\n| Earth.  | ka-la\u00ed     | klai, thalai | myay |\n| Elephant.| ka-sai    | kasai   | tsin    |\n| Hand.   | kuth       | kut-pak | let     |\n| Head.   | l\u00ed         | lu      | goung   |\n| Horn.   | a-rung     | a-reng, rung | gyo   |\n|         | ta-ki      | ta-ki   |         |\n| Horse.  | sapu       | sapuk   | myen    |\n| Mother. | anu, nu    | an-nu, onu | amay |\n| Night.  | ay\u00e1n       | ayan    | nya     |\n| Star.   | kirek      | merik   | kyay    |\n| Tree.   | tsindung   | sundong | apin    |\n|         | thin       | thing   |         |\n| Village.| nam, thing | nam, ting | yua   |\n| Water.  | tui        | tui, tui | yay     |\n\nWe have thus a large number of common words in which the Arracan dialects agree closely with the various dialects spread over the country extending north and west to the Brahmap\u00fatra River, and in which they differ from the Burman. The extent of the coincidence is too great to be fortuitous, and the past history and social condition of these tribes forbid our ascribing it to mutual intercourse and influence, such as has caused the adoption of several\nHindustani words for domestic objects, in some of the Brahmap\u00fatra dialects.\n\nWe have thus collected into one group, more or less closely allied, the Chepang and other 'broken tribes' of West Nep\u00e1l, the Arracan Hill tribes, and those various races to the east and south of the Brahmap\u00fatra. The next step will be to show the connexion between these last and the Burman. That they belong to the Tibeto-Burman stock is generally conceded, it will only therefore need to take a few examples from three representative dialects, the Mikir, the Kuki, and N\u00e1g\u00e1:\n\n| Burmese | Mikir | Kuki | N\u00e1g\u00e1 |\n|---------|-------|------|------|\n| Bitter  | Kha   | ak\u00e9-ho | akhai | K\u00e9khu |\n| Blood   | Thway | m\u00e9k   | Thi   | Th\u00e9-za |\n| Eye     | Myet(k) | m\u00e9kum | Mit   | Mhi   |\n| Eyebrow | Myet-kon | m\u00e9kum | kemit-kho |      |\n| Fire    | Mee   | m\u00e9    | mei   | m\u00ed    |\n| Fish    | Nga   | ng\u00e1   | n\u00e1    |       |\n| Fruit   | a-th\u00eb\u00eb | ath\u00eb |       |       |\n| Great   | kyee-thee | k\u00e9-th\u00eb |       | k\u00e9-di |\n| House   | Eim   | h\u00e9m   | in    |       |\n| Kill    | that  |       | that tan |       |\n| Listen  | na-toung |       | ngai-tan |       |\n| Little  | a-nay |       | a-n\u00e9o  |       |\n| Long    | a-shay |       | a-shao |       |\n| Moon    | la    |       | lh\u00e1   |       |\n| Nose    | na-koung | no-kan | nakdi |       |\n| Rice    | tsau  | sang  | chang-chang |       |\n| Road    | lam   |       | lampi | lam\u00e1  |\n| Sick    | na    |       | ana   |       |\n| Tail    | a-myee | arm\u00e9  | amei  | mi    |\n| Water   | yay   | lang  | tui   | dzu   |\n\n(Kachari di)\n\nThe word 'water' is singular in having preserved in each dialect a separate root, and all differing from the Burmese. Thus the Kuki has the 'tui' of the Arracan Hill Tribes, from the Chinese 'sui'; the N\u00e1g\u00e1 has 'dzu,' derived, like the Tibetan and Serpa 'chu,' from the Chinese 'chui'; the Kachari preserves the 'ti' root of the Karen dialects in the form of 'di' (d=t); while the Mikir 'lang' seems to be derived from the Newar 'la,' or more probably is a form of an archaic root preserved in the Kusunda 'tang.' Thus\nthese kindred and neighbouring dialects possess in this word 'water' distinctive roots belonging to four widely sundered separate branches of Turanian speech. This can hardly be chance, still less probable is it that each deliberately borrowed its peculiar term; we must believe that each dialect in its earliest growth adopted and kept one of the many synonymous roots of the common mother Turanian language.\n\nThe first five numerals are given below, and it may be noted that they afford an instance of what Max Muller and other philologists have remarked of the tendency of these savage dialects to find separate expressions for the first and often the second numerals, while deriving the others from common roots.\n\n| Burmese | Mikir | Kuki | Naga |\n|---------|-------|------|------|\n| One     | Ta, tit | Isi | Khat | A-khaz |\n| Two     | Nit   | Hi-ni | Ni, uk | A-ne |\n| Three   | Thong | K\u00e9-thom | Tham | A-sam |\n| Four    | Lay   | Phi-li | Li, li | Phu-li |\n| Five    | Nga   | Pha-nga | Ka-nga | Pha-nga |\n\nIt will be seen that there is less resemblance to the Burmese forms than to some of the Himalayan dialects, especially to the Magar numerals, 1. kat, 2. ni, 3. song, 4. bu-li, 5. ba-nga. The country of the N\u00e1g\u00e1 tribes has been already described; the Kukis extend over the hilly tracts from the valley of the Koladan in Arracan, where they border on the Kumbis, to Northern Cachar, where they march with the Mikir tribe on the Kopilee river. This latter clan (the Mikir) occupy the hills of the Nowgong District east of the Brahmaputra River. They are the furthest removed of all these tribes from possible Burman influence, and still they exhibit the closest affinity in language to them. It must, however, be said that these tribes, having probably the same origin as those of the Arracan Hills, seem to have formerly occupied the whole mountainous country around the head-waters of the Kyendwen River, until in comparatively recent times they were driven westward by the Singpho, Ahor, and Khamti races.\n\nWe have hitherto dealt with the wilder tribes on the western side of Burma, but there remains one great and\nimportant race which extends itself along the whole northern frontier of Burma Proper from Yunnan, where it is designated 'Kakhyen,' into Assam, where the tribes style themselves 'Singpho,' that is, 'men' par excellence. It has been alleged that they are allied to the Karen race, and this by so late a writer as Anderson in his \"Mandelay to Momein,\" published in 1876, but except in their state of savage rudeness, and certain customs that are common to almost all the primitive tribes of these regions, there is really nothing to warrant this idea. On the contrary, the comparison of their vocabularies shows that, outside the common Indo-Chinese roots, all their lingual affinities are with the Burmo-Naga languages, as shown below:\n\n| Burmese | Naga Dialects | Singpho | Karen |\n|---------|---------------|---------|-------|\n| One     | ta, tit       | Ama     | Ai-m\u00e1 | hta, la |\n| Two     | nhit          |         | nkhong | 'kie, nie |\n| Three   | thong         | A-sam   | ma-sum | thou |\n| Four    | l\u00e9            | a-li, be-li | me-li | lwie, lie |\n| Five    | nga           | m\u00e4nga   | ma-nga | yai |\n| Six     | krouk         | { ta-ruk | kru   | khu, khoo |\n|         |               | krk (Chepang) } |       |       |\n| Seven   | koo-nit       | nith, i-ngnit | si-nith | nwi, nwai |\n| I       | nga           | ngai    | ngai  | ya, yer |\n| Thou    | nang, nin     | nang    | nang, ni | nah, ner |\n| He      | thoo          | mih, kho (Tibet) | khi | awai, ur |\n| Air     | l\u00e9            | ma-bung | m'bung | kli, li |\n| Bird    | nghet         | ta-wu (Kumi) | wu | to, tu |\n| Blood   | thway         | ai-chui | sai   | thwi |\n| Bone    | aro           | rha, kereng (Garo) | nrang | khi, kwi |\n| Cow     | nua           | masu    | kan-su | po, k'lan |\n| Dog     | kway          | kui     | gui   | htwi |\n| Fire    | mee           | van     | wan   | may, mi |\n| Flower  | pan           | taben   | sibam | paw |\n| Hair    | san           | { kra (Murmi) | kara | kho-thoo |\n|         |               | skra (Tibet) } |       |       |\n| Hand    | let           | lappa (Bhutan) | lett\u00e1 | tsu, su |\n| Head    | khoung        | gu-bong | bong  | hko |\n| Hog     | wak           | vak, vah (Horpa) | wa | to, htn |\n| Horse   | mrang         | se rang (Chepang) | ka-mrang | ka-thi, thi |\n| Moon    | l\u00e1            | yita, lita | sita | lah |\n| Mother  | may           | annu, nu (Khyen) | nu | mo |\n| River   | mrach         | kharr   | kh\u00e1   | klo |\n| Road    | lam           | lam     | lam   | klay |\n| Salt    | tsa           | hum, sum | jum   | itha, htula |\n| Sun     | nay           | san, sanh | jan   | mu, muh |\nIn these examples some of the Burmese words are written as spelt, and not as pronounced, to show the true root. There is surely enough to warrant our affiliating the Singpho to the Nag\u00e1, and not to the Karen race, until the latter theory is proved by some incontestable evidence.\n\nThe Singpho or Kakhyens now fringe the whole northern frontier of Burma, extending from the Chinese province of Yunnan into the valley of Assam. Their irruption into Assam took place about 1783, and is a comparatively modern instance of the flux and reflux which characterized the early movements of all these races. Cut off for centuries from their Nag\u00e1 brethren, who at one time joined them in the Upper Valley of the Khyeen-dwen River, as their tribes increased in numbers, they have had no room to expand eastward, owing to the barrier opposed by Chinese civilization; the Burman power checked them on the south: they have thus been forced to use the only outlet afforded them, and partly retrace westward the route of their original migrations.\nART. X.\u2014Burmese Transliteration. By H. L. St. Barbe, Esq., Resident at Mandalay.\n\nIn 1872 the Local Government of the province arranged to become purchaser of Dr. Mason\u2019s work on \u201cBurma.\u201d The author was an American missionary, who had spent nearly all his life in the country, and whose name is well known amongst Oriental scholars as having been the first to discover and bring to light Kaccay\u0101no\u2019s Pali Grammar, which is to this day the handbook here in every village school. The last edition of \u201cBurma\u201d had been published in 1860. Since that date the writer had been amassing new collectanea, and it was agreed that he should personally supervise a fresh publication, which was intended, in his hands, to become a kind of encyclop\u00e6dia of all scientific subjects connected with the province. But Dr. Mason was never destined to see the consummation of the work he had laboured at so long. For some time his missionary duties interfered with all active literary endeavour, and his death in 1874 finally prevented the execution of the original design. His notes and MSS., after remaining for three years in the possession of his widow, have been consigned by Government to one who is fully conscious how incompetent he is single-handed for the task.\n\nBefore his decease, Dr. Mason had consulted with the Secretariat on the question of an uniform scheme of Burmese transliteration to be employed in the forthcoming work. He pointed out that no recognized system was at present in force: every Government servant was at liberty to follow his own method; the result being that the English equivalents\nfor even the commonest vernacular names were very rarely alike in two publications.\\(^1\\)\n\nNo definite plan, however, was adopted, either by the Local Government or by Dr. Mason, and the same initial difficulty still remains in the way of his successor.\n\nThere have been a variety of systems suggested. Captain Latter, Dr. Judson, Colonel Horace Browne, and Dr. Hunter have all attempted a solution of the problem. Their efforts have been entirely confined to a more or less exact reproduction of the language as it is spoken. This is no doubt a difficult matter, but the difficulty in their case has been intensified by their reluctance to diverge too widely from the written Burmese character. There is probably no language in the world where the letters offer so little clue to the pronunciation, where there are so many modifications of vocal sounds, and so much change, confusion, and euphonic variation of consonantal sounds, without any corresponding variation in the writing. If you want to represent the speech, you must altogether neglect the spelling, and vice versa. No compromise is possible between the two.\n\nBut in a book with any scientific pretensions, due regard must be had to both the spoken and written character. Few languages can be of any real philological value until we know the symbols of which they are composed. Moreover, all the more civilized peoples of the province have borrowed their alphabet, their literature, and a considerable portion of their vocabulary, from the adjacent continent. They have generally altered the use and appearance of their acquisitions, so that, to enable us to trace their origin, these must be reattired in their original garb. On the other hand, for ordinary every-day purposes, the written or antique form of a language is practically worthless. What is wanted is some arrangement of letters which articulation renders intelligible with more or less completeness.\n\nI have tried to secure both these ends by developing a\n\n\\(^1\\) I have seen the name of a large district in the Tonassery Division transliterated in the following ways: Shwegeen, Shwaygeen, Shwaygyen, Shwayghen, Shwegyen, Shwegyen, and Shwegyuen.\nmethod which Dr. Hunter has made use of in his \"Non-Aryan Languages,\" i.e. by giving two versions of every word, the one as it is written, the other as it is pronounced. The Burmese alphabet is simply one of the numerous modifications of the old Pali or Nagari type. In representing its individual characters I have accordingly used the English symbols which are now employed in every attempt at Indian transliteration. As a fact, they do not accurately give the present sound of the consonants of the second varga, and one or two other letters. But apart from the advantage of uniformity with the continental system, I am of opinion that this change in pronunciation has occurred within a comparatively recent date. In Father Sangermano's time, \u1e63 was certainly pronounced as 's' (as it is still by the Shans and Talaings), and \u1e0d probably as the 'ch' in church. Thus he talks of 'sw\u0101' (to go), 'hansa,' 'mahasamata,' and 'Che-pang' and 'Chittaun,' for 'Sagain' and 'Sittoung'; while Captain Latter mentions \u1e63 as the only sibilant in the language approaching to the sound of 's.' I have therefore made no change in the English equivalent so far as the written character is concerned, but in representing this or any other sound, the nearest English letter will always be employed.\n\nThe Burmese alphabet consists of 11 vowels and 32 consonants. They are as follows:\n\n| Consonants | Vowels |\n|------------|--------|\n| k kh g gh \u1e45 | a \u0101 |\n| c ch j jh \u014b | i \u012b |\n| \u1e6d \u1e6dh \u1e0d dh \u1e47 | u \u016b |\n| t th d dh n | e ai |\n| p ph b bh m | o au |\n| y r l w s | ui |\n| h \u1e25 | |\n\nI may remark that the vowel 'ui' (or 'o' as it has hitherto been written) is generally described as a diphthong. It is no more of a diphthong, of course, than 'ai' or 'au.'\nI have transliterated it 'ui' to represent its apparent components. It must be clearly understood that the above letters are no guide whatever to the pronunciation. They are simply intended to indicate the corresponding characters in our Indian alphabet, while, at the same time, they will enable any Burmese scholar to reproduce the exact vernacular combination they express. They represent in short the written language.\n\nThe spoken language may be roughly analyzed as follows:\n\nFirst, the vowel sounds as above, a, \u0101, i, \u012b, u, \u016b, e, ai, o, au, which are all to be pronounced according to the Hunterian method. Here again it is necessary to note that these symbols (especially the last three) afford no clue to the written character. The Burmese, in adopting the letters 'ai' and 'o' and 'au,' changed the first from the sound of the 'ai' in 'aisle' to nearly the sound of the 'ai' in 'hair,' and both the second and third from the vowel sounds in 'toll' and 'haus' to the vowel sound in 'aught,' pronounced more or less broadly. These new vocables will require fresh English symbols. I propose expressing the first by '\u0113' and the second by 'oa' (as in 'ear'). The appropriate English combination is manifestly 'au,' and it is a pity that, ordinarily, this is used to indicate a sound which 'au' more clearly represents. There is another vowel which I shall have to denote. It is a short 'e,' like the 'e' in 'met,' and will be, I think, best designated by the letter '\u0113' with a diacritical mark. It may be objected that I have now got the letter 'e' to represent three different vowel sounds. But as a fact these sounds are not very divergent in Burmese. Most English students find it hard to discriminate between '\u0113' and '\u0113,' and the latter vowel with an acute accent can scarcely be distinguished from '\u0113.' 'Ai' is the prevalent method of expressing '\u0113,' but these characters, as I have just shown, are already employed in the Hunterian system. There is one more vocable in the Burmese which may be thought to require a distinguishing symbol. The letter 'w' before certain final consonants modifies the inherent vowel into a sound about midway between 'o' and 'u.' It is\nusually transliterated 'oo' and 'u,' but both these forms are clearly exceptionable. The modification differs in no appreciable degree from 'u,' and this letter may be used accordingly.\n\nTurning to the consonants we find the following sounds:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\nk & hk & g & ng \\\\\ns & hs & z & ny \\\\\nt & ht & d & n \\\\\np & hp & b & m \\\\\ny & l & w & th, h \\text{ and the compound } ch \\text{ and } sh.\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nWhen the reader compares this with the foregoing table of the written characters, he will gather correctly enough that the Burmese make no distinction (1) between an aspirated and an unaspirated soft consonant, (2) between cerebrals and dentals, and (3) between 'y' and 'r.' He will notice also that I have had to prefix instead of affix the aspirate, to avoid confusion between 'hs' and 'sh,' 'ht' and 'th.'\n\nI can now give a full alphabetical table of the spoken language.\n\n**Vowels.**\n\n|   |   |\n|---|---|\n| a | as in woman |\n| \u0101 | ,, father |\n| i | ,, pin |\n| \u012b | ,, pique |\n| u | ,, full |\n| \u016b | ,, mute |\n| e | ,, met |\n\n|   |   |\n|---|---|\n| \u00ea | as in rate |\n| \u0113 | ,, hair |\n| o | ,, note |\n| oa | ,, soar |\n| ai | ,, aisle |\n| au | ,, sound |\n\nThe consonants require but little explanation. 'ng' is a sound that cannot be exemplified; 's' and 'hs' are generally pronounced as if they were 'ts' and 'hts'; 'w' is occasionally slurred altogether, when its sequent vowel is modified into 'u'; 'ch' and 'sh' approximate to the sound in the English words 'church' and 'shame.'\n\nI have made this paper as brief and clear as possible, in the hopes of provoking some criticism and discussion. The chief advantage of the method I suggest is its entire con-\nformity with the Hunterian system, on the ground which the latter covers. To obtain this result some sacrifices have to be made when we pass beyond these limits; but the changes are few and not especially uncouth, and very little practice would make them natural and familiar.\n\nThe whole design differs in a very slight degree from that which has been adopted and uniformly practised by Sir Arthur Phayre, than whom no better authority could be cited on any subject connected with Indo-Chinese philology.\nART. XI.\u2014On the Connexion of the M\u00f4ns of Pegu with the Koles of Central India. By Capt. C. J. F. S. Forbes, of the Burmese Civil Commission.\n\nAmong the races now occupying the Indo-Chinese Peninsula, the oldest, the M\u00f4n, has been little studied, and is generally passed over as an insignificant tribe of little interest in any way. Yet the facts which point them out as being the occupiers of the Delta of the Irrawaddy before the arrival of the Tibeto-Burman tribes, from whom they are quite distinct, seem worthy of consideration.\n\nAlthough the M\u00f4ns are the oldest race now existing in the Peninsula, there is reason to believe that they had their predecessors. The earliest M\u00f4n traditions state that when the Buddhist missionaries arrived on the coast, they were welcomed near Thatone, but were opposed and stoned by the Beloos when they attempted to land near Martaban. Close opposite Martaban is the large island called to this day Beloo-gyun\u00b9 (Beloo Island). We know that Beloos (Monsters) was the name given to an aboriginal people whom the M\u00f4n and Burman races found occupying the sea-coast. It may reasonably be conjectured that these aborigines belonged to some of the tribes now found on the Andaman or Nicobar groups. These last have been conjectured to be descended from refugees of the M\u00f4n race themselves. F. A. de Roepstorff, the latest authority we have on these islanders, in his interesting monograph and vocabulary, and also in his remarks in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, July, 1876, thinks they \"are possibly the remains of a race of Mongolians, who were peaceably settled on the Nicobar Islands, cultivating the land, and perhaps in a higher state of civili-\n\n\u00b9 In the M\u00f4n language, T'kaw 'k'ming.\nThey were perhaps attacked by the Malay race that is now living on the Nanowry group.\" This may be so; but, from the little known of them and their language, though there may be sufficient to connect them with the great family of Mongoloids, their affinity with the M\u00f4ns of Pegu is at present merely a conjecture unsupported by evidence. That the M\u00f4ns found an aboriginal race in the country, and drove them out, is probable. Whence came the M\u00f4ns themselves? That they do not belong to the Tibeto-Burman family is clear and acknowledged. Two authorities, to whom great deference on this point is due, the late Dr. Mason and Sir A. Phayre, have adopted a theory which, as it appears to be gaining ground, demands examination.\n\nDr. Mason, in 1860, was the first to propound it. In his work on Burma, page 130, he writes: \"In its vocables the Talaing (M\u00f4n) is the most isolated language of Farther India. Its roots are not allied to Tai, Burman, Karen, Toungthu, Kyen, Kemu, Singpu, Naga, Manipuri, nor any other known language spoken by the Indo-Chinese nations. Nor is it cognate with the Chinese or Tibetan, or any of the Tatar tongues, of which specimens have been published. It is not related to the Sanskrit or Hindu families of Northern Hindustan; nor to the cultivated tongues of Southern India and Ceylon, the Telugu, Carnataka, Tuluva, Tamil, Malayalam, Malabar, and Sinhalese. I have compared the Talaing with vocabularies of all these and others, and find it radically different; though, here and there, words of apparently common origin may be discovered. Whence then has it been derived? In Central Hindustan there are several wild tribes inhabiting the mountainous regions, which are called Koles, Orans, and Gonds, whose languages seem to have had a common origin. The first notice of these people which I have seen was published by Major Tickell in 1840, in a paper on the Koles, whom he denominates Hos. This paper affords the most complete view of the people and their language that has yet been made public; and from this it is\n\nThere is, nevertheless, a certain amount of resemblance to the Mon in the vocabulary of the Nanowry dialect.\napparent, singular as it may seem, that the Talaing language has a radical affinity with the Kole. The first six numerals, the personal pronouns, the words for several members of the body and many objects of nature, with a few verbs, are unquestionably of common origin, while many other words bearing a more remote resemblance are probably derived from the same roots.\" (Then follows a list of words.)\n\n\"The Chinese, the Tai, the Burman, the Karen, and all the known languages of Farther India, including the Assamese, are known to use numeral affixes; while the Talaing language stands alone, and, like Occidental tongues, unites the numeral to the noun. Thus a Talaing says: '\u00e0k\u00e0baing b\u00e0' two passages, 'tnom pi' three stones, and 'agni paun' four houses. While in Chinese, and in all the other Indo-Chinese languages, the numeral is united to an affix. The Kole has the same idiom as the Talaing. A singular noun in Kole is made plural by affixing ko, and, in Talaing, there is a plural affix tau. But what confirms still more the common origin for the Talaings and Koles is their name. One tribe among the Koles are called Oraons, who, at an unknown period, were driven by the Brahmanical Hindus from the neighbourhood of the Ganges. 'It is these Oraons,' writes Major Tickell, 'who first give us accounts of a people called Moondas, whom they found in possession of Chootia Nagpoor.' These Moondas now call themselves Hos, but are more generally known as Koles. Moond, their ancient name, is almost identical with moan, the name by which the Talaings now call themselves, and it would be difficult to find any two nations of a different origin with names so nearly the same.\"\n\nSir A. Phayre, in his \"History of Pegu,\" follows Dr. Mason. He says: \"That learned man has, in his work on Burma, pointed out the remarkable similarity between the language of the Mun of Pegu, and that of the Horo or Mund\u00e1 people of Chuti\u00e1 N\u00e1gp\u00far, called the Kols. The first syllable of the word Mund\u00e1, which is used, as I understand,\n\n1 Journal Asiatic Society Bengal, 1873, p. 35.\nto designate the language of several tribes in the western highlands of Bengal, rather than as a tribal name, is identical in sound with the race name of the people of Pegu. The connexion of the two peoples, as shown by the similarity of their languages in a series of test words, has been commented on by the Honourable Mr. Campbell, in a paper on the Races of India, in the Journal of the Ethnological Society. We appear, then, to be forced to the conclusion, that the Mun or Talising people of Pegu are of the same stock as the Kols and other aboriginal tribes of India who may have occupied that country before even the Dravidians entered it.\"\n\nIn the Journal of the same Society for 1876, Sir. A. Phayre repeats, and finds a confirmation of, this theory, in the resemblance between the stone implements found in Pegu and in Chutia Nagpur, which will be considered separately.\n\nNow let us examine the philological arguments adduced.\n\nThe coincidence of words in the two languages we shall leave for the present, merely remarking that the comparative tables given at the end will show equal, if not greater affinities to several other languages. With regard to any argument founded on the resemblance between the tribal names Mun and Munda, we may observe that we find the tribal names M\u00fcndu used by the Man and Kamba, and Muntu by the Pokomo tribes in South Africa, according to Prichard, but we surely would not thence conclude any connexion between these latter and the Kolarians.\n\nMax Muller truly says, \"Grammar is the most essential element, and therefore the ground of classification in all languages which have produced a definite grammatical articulation.\" Again, \"Languages, though mixed in their dictionary, can never be mixed in their grammar.\" Let us then compare the grammatical structure of the Mon or M\u00fcn, and the Kol or Ho languages.\n\nThe M\u00fcn is exceedingly rough and guttural, abounding in a rolling sound of the letter r, and sudden abrupt checks in the pronunciation of words ending in a silent h.\n\nThe Ho language of Chutia Nagpur is described thus: \"The sounds are exceedingly pure and liquid, without strong\napplies to nouns; and in some words the inflexions of the noun are conterminous with adjectives.\n\nIt may serve here to state preliminarily interesting features of its constitution, and the distinctness from the other languages of the Latin family, by which it differs. In its case there is no numerical affixes, as in such cases, which many suppose there should be. The nouns, for instance, have singular, dual, and plural forms. But in the Celtiberian word does occur, it appears, as in the same, but in that word, not as an inflectional phenomenon, but as a substantive, so that the noun was there also the substantive. It seems therefore to be a substantive and substantive form, without the oblique cases being attached to it, as in the Indian languages, or like manner, in which the case suffixes were attached to them, as in Sanskrit.\n\nIt would thus appear that these two cases are unnecessary, or do not exist, in the former case, and that the oblique cases are not necessary in the second. In M\u00f4n the nominative case affects the nouns in all cases, whether masculine or feminine, excepting those nouns whose terminations are though or direct. These nouns must therefore be treated differently, according to their quality. The nominative affix is always \\(-s\\), regardless of the termination of the noun, and is added before the grammatical finals.\n\nThe nouns, however, have not a wide range of variation, being more limited than in other languages, especially in the oblique cases. The nouns take the case affixes, but there are no particular case affixes for these nouns. They are distinguished only by the grammatical finals, although there is an exception where the nouns take the case affixes. In M\u00f4n nouns take case affixes only where they belong to a particular category, and it is generally used in the same way as in other languages.\n\nIn the Celtic languages there is a great variety of nouns and adjectives in moods and cases. The nouns have no inflexions for number, and there are distinguished only by their quality.\nand plural; to which the pronouns add a fourth, the plural comprehensive. The M\u00f4n has not the slightest trace of the peculiar dual number.\n\nIt seems almost impossible to consider two languages so widely apart in their structural character as capable of being brought into affinity with each other on the strength of a resemblance in a certain number of words in their vocabularies. A similar coincidence between words in Chinese and Anglo-Saxon English has been traced, but we must seek the explanation of this elsewhere than in affinity of race.\n\nNevertheless, Sir A. Phayre finds strong confirmation of this theory in the resemblance between the peculiar stone implements originally found in Burma and the Mahayan Peninsula, but, lately also, discovered in Chuti\u00e2 N\u00e2gp\u00fbr. He remarks in the Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal for January, 1876: \"I observe in the Proceedings of the Asiatic Society for June, 1875, a paper by Mr. V. Ball, on Stone Implements of the Burmese type found in the district of Singhabhum. I beg to bring to your notice that the stone weapons hitherto sent from Burma have, I believe, all been found within the limits of the territory, in the delta and valley of the lower Er\u00e2wati, occupied from time immemorial by the Tal\u00e2ing or Mun people. The language of the Mun race of Pegu is connected with that of the Ho or Mund\u00e2 people of Chuti\u00e2 N\u00e2gp\u00fbr, called Kol. I beg, on this subject, to refer to my paper on the History of Pegu, in the Society's Journal, vol. xii. of 1873.\n\n\"The form of the stone implements remarked on by Mr. Ball tends to indicate a connexion of race, or intercourse in prehistoric time, between the Ko\u00efs and the Mun of Pegu. The supposed origin of these weapons, as thrown to earth in the lightning flash, is, as remarked by Mr. Theobald, the same among both peoples.\"\n\nThis argument is again referred to by Mr. Ball in the same Society's Proceedings for June, 1876, where he says: \"Sir A. Phayre shows that the part of Burma in which the stone implements occur\u2014the valley and delta of the lower Er\u00e2wati\u2014is inhabited by a race called M\u00fbn, whose language\npresents affinities with that of the M\u00fand\u00e1s of Singbh\u00fam. Hence the probability of an early intercourse having existed, and possibly of an identity of origin, between these now widely-separated peoples, becomes very great.\"\n\nNow to carry out Sir A. Phayre's argument, we must allow the premiss, either that the M\u00fans and Mund\u00e1s are the autochthones of Pegu and Singbh\u00fam, or that there is reason to believe that the ancestors of these peoples used stone implements when they migrated into their present localities.\n\nWith regard to the Mund\u00e1s of Singbh\u00fam, we know that they are not autochthonous, for the Bhooyas or Bhooians occupied the country before them. We have certainly no proof of who were the predecessors of the M\u00fans in Pegu, but there is every reason to believe that they found an aboriginal race before them.\n\nThere is little, if any, cause to suppose, according to the second premiss, that the ancestors of the M\u00fans, or of the Mund\u00e1s, were among the races who employed stone implements, at the period when they arrived in their present localities. The probability is to the contrary. Both races possess words for iron original to their languages, and not borrowed from their neighbours, and with our knowledge of the constant waves of migration that swept over Eastern lands in the prehistoric times, it appears far too arbitrary an assumption that neolithic implements belong necessarily to the variety of the human species now occupying the locality in which they are found.\n\nThe remark respecting the similar origin ascribed to these implements by both peoples is not of much value as an argument in point, for we find the same idea prevailing in England, in Brittany, in Finnland, in Japan, and other countries.\u00b9\n\nThere really, then, is no proof that the stone implements found in Pegu and Singbh\u00fam were fashioned or ever used by the early M\u00fans and Kols inhabiting those districts, and not by some still earlier prim\u00e6val races, perhaps of the Negrito family.\n\n\u00b9 Tytler, Early History of Man, p. 226.\nBut although there is no ground for believing in a race connexion between the M\u00f4ns of Pegu and the Kolarian races, it does not follow that there may not have been a prehistoric intercourse between them. The former idea has been carried to its fullest development in the Official Report on the Imperial Census of British Burma in 1872, where it is stated that \"the Talaiing nation appears to have been formed from two distinct stocks, both starting from India, and uniting into one people at Burma. The name Talaiing is supposed to be merely a reproduction of Telenga or Telengana, and the people to whom the name was primarily applied are taken to have been Dravidian colonists who came over by sea and settled at Thatun... The other, and probably more numerous stock, are believed to be identical with the pre-Aryan Kols of Central India, and call themselves M\u00f4ns.\"\n\nDr. Logan appears to present the most reasonable view of the subject. \"The first migration from the northern side of the Himalaya is now best represented by the Anam, Kambojan, M\u00f4n, and Lau tribes. Their languages have structural and glossarial characters which distinguish them from the Tibetan, and, in the first era of their southern dispersion, they must have occupied a part of Bengal, and had a close intercourse with aboriginal Indian tribes of the north-east Dravidian or Kol family. At a later period they were intimately connected with the succeeding great migration from Tibet, that of the proper Tibeto-Burman tribes, but appear to have been gradually pressed by them to the eastward and southward... Two thousand years ago the Chinese found the Anamese in possession of the basin of the Sang-koi.\" \"The M\u00f4ns long preceded the Siamese in the Tenasserim provinces, and the languages of the Simang and Binna of the Malay Peninsula retain deep traces of their ancient influence to the south. Before the great southern movement of the Lau, the M\u00f4n appear to have occupied the basin of the Menam also, and to have marched and intermixed with the closely-allied Kambojans of the Lower Mekong.\"\n\n1 Journ. Ind. Arch. vol. ii. pp. 70, 76.\nThe actual routes of the successive migrations of branches of the human race in the earliest times must ever be a matter, more or less, of mere speculation. At the same time, physical geography points out to us prominently three great lines eastward along which the masses must have moved; viz., one over the passes of the Thian Shan, along the great highway of Chinese Tatary, across the Desert of Gobi, into China Proper: the second, over the Karakorum range into the Valley of Kashmir, and thence into Tibet: the third, through the Khyber Pass into the Valley of the Indus.\n\nThe Chinese, and probably the Karens, seem to have followed the first, but, according to the earliest Chinese annals and traditions, they found aboriginal tribes, the Miau, Lo Lo, and others before them.\n\nThe M\u00f4n-Anam races, to use Logan\u2019s term, appear to have taken the second route, through Tibet, debouching into the Upper Valley of the Brahmaputra, and, thence, spreading at an unknown date eastwards into Farther India as far as the Gulf of Tonquin, probably pressed on by their cousins, the Tibeto-Burman tribes, following the same course. This, of course, must remain a mere conjecture, but, if we allow a sojourn more or less extended in the valley of the Brahmaputra to the early progenitors of the M\u00f4n-Anam races, the intercourse between them and those Kolarian tribes who once occupied Bengal is accounted for.\n\nThe relation of the M\u00f4n-Anam languages to each other, and their divergence from their neighbours, is shown in their structure even more than in their vocabulary.\n\n1. The M\u00f4n, Siamese, and Annamitic are agreed in the use of prefixed case particles (prepositions), while all the Tibetan dialects adopt suffixes (postpositions). The Chinese employs suffixes to mark the locative case, but prefixes in the others. The Karen also employs prepositions throughout.\n\n2. The M\u00f4n, Siamese, and Annamitic are distinguished by the inverted form of the genitive, that is, the thing possessed precedes the possessor, as house man; in Chinese, Karen and Tibeto-Burman, the natural order, man\u2019s house, is followed.\n3. The Mon, Siamese, Annamitic, and Karen agree in the postposition of the demonstrative, while the Chinese and Tibeto-Burman place the pronoun before the substantive.\n\n4. The Tibetan languages are, above all, distinguished from the Chinese and East Himalayan, or Mon-Anam, by the great inversion of the sentence in which the verb comes after its object.\n\nIt is thus seen that while the Mon, Siamese, and Annamitic dialects all accord with each other on these important structural points, they differ with the Tibeto-Burman in all, and with the Chinese and Karen in some, while they agree in others. We are, therefore, apparently warranted in classing the former languages under a separate head, and, from their structure, awarding them a date anterior to any of their present neighbours.\n\nWhen, however, we come to compare the vocabularies of all these races, we find affinities that can be accounted for only on the ground of intimate connexion and intercourse at some period of their history in their present localities, or by the theory that they formed, in a prehistoric time while still settled in their original Western home, one family speaking a common tongue, before each in its turn quitted the primaeval hive on its Eastern migration. There is no doubt the Mon, the Burmese, the Siamese, the Karen, have, to a certain extent, mutually influenced each other by contact and intercourse in their present abodes; but we cannot conclude the same of the Mon with the Chinese and pure Tibetan dialects, and must therefore refer the coincidences between these to a common radical origin\u2014calling this Turanian, Mongolian, or what you will.\nART. XII.\u2014Studies on the Comparative Grammar of the Semitic Languages, with Special Reference to Assyrian.\n\nBy Paul Haupt.\n\nThe Oldest Semitic Verb-Form.\n\nWhen we consider the progress made by comparative Indo-European philology, we can only wonder that even after the discovery of Assyrian, which undoubtedly represents the Sanskrit of the Semitic languages, no attempt has been made to form a comparative Semitic grammar. Assyrian has hitherto been regarded as at most useful for the explanation of certain questions of Hebrew lexicography; as for the morphology of the Semitic tongues, scholars have been content with simply stating the analogies which exist between Assyrian and the allied languages. The cause of this lies mainly in the fact that Assyrian is regarded as a corrupt branch of the Semitic family of speech; and much that is peculiar in its structure, the preservation of which really implies the highest antiquity, is treated as so many new formations, so that the possibility of properly utilizing Assyrian grammatical forms for the explanation of Semitic grammar is at the outset taken away. Hence, as long as such thoroughly perverse views are not given up, a scientific philology of the Semitic languages can never take its place by the side of that of the Indo-European languages.\n\nBefore all else it is needful distinctly to state and demonstrate that Assyrian is in truth the Sanskrit of the Semitic family of speech, as E. Hincks and A. H. Sayce have already clearly recognized.\n\nThis fact ought of itself to indicate that Assyrian is the oldest Semitic language of which we know. In spite of this high antiquity; in spite, too, of its being specially character-\nized by the fixity that distinguishes the Semitic languages; it is just of Assyrian that such a linguistic decay\u2014such a loss of the original features of Semitic speech\u2014has been asserted, that an Indo-European scholar would look suspiciously on a statement like the above when made by the Semitic philologist, and ask doubtfully: \"How can this fit together?\" The Assyrian language, we are told, is an old one, in fact the oldest Semitic dialect with which we are acquainted; and yet the Perfect, which has been so richly developed in all the sister-idioms, has already disappeared, without leaving a trace behind, in the earliest monuments of Assyrian literature!\"\n\n\"The Passive forms, again, with internal vowel-change, have been completely lost, with one exception which is itself extremely uncertain, and replaced by Reflexive forms\u2014Reflexive forms, be it observed, which are always older and more original than Passive forms, as a glance at the development of the Passive in the Indo-European languages will inform us.\"\n\n\"Asyrian, moreover, it is said, agrees in a very remarkable manner with Ethiopic, which, though separated from it at so early a period, has accidentally lighted upon the creation of exactly the same Imperfect form (gen\u00e4ger, q\u00e4tul); in Ethiopic, according to the usual view, in order to compensate for the modal forms with final vowels preserved in Arabic (yaqtulu, yaqtula, yagtl, or rather yagltul);\n\n1 Passages like W.

With equal justice we could also claim the correspondence of a form q\u00e4tul with the Hebrew pass. part. \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03b1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f01\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd, or rather yagltul;\n\n\"over doors and bolts (of the underworld)\" \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03b1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f01\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd, is spread the dust.\" Both forms, however, are very uncertain, since the length of the vowel of the second syllable has not yet been proved by scriptio plena, at all events, I am unacquainted with any passage in which \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03b1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f01\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd is written. On the contrary, the reading \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03b1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f01\u03c1\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bd makes it more probable that we should transcribe, not q\u00e4tul and q\u00e4tul, but q\u00e4tul and q\u00e4tul. In dealing with the Assyrian conjugation in a future publication, I hope to point out that in Assyrian the participial passive and the partipial active are not yet sharply distinguished from one another.\nin Assyrian, in order to compensate for the loss of the Perfect.\"\n\nUnfortunately, however, this so-called new formation, the Imperfect, occurs by no means rarely with final vowels in Assyrian, forms like *iq\u00e1tala* being common enough; while in Ethiopic, unhappily for the ordinary explanation, the Perfect, whose loss in Assyrian would have occasioned this so-called new formation, is found richly developed.\n\nHence it follows plainly that both views are false, and the assumption of a new formation can be justified upon no satisfactory ground.\n\nInstead of assuming that two languages, so far removed from one another, the one in the extreme north, the other in the extreme south of the Semitic region, should yet have both hit upon one and the self-same new formation in the earliest period known to us, and with a most remarkable, though accidental, uniformity of action, it is certainly much more natural to believe that where the Assyrian and Ethiopic agree in forms (and words), we are dealing not with new formations which have accidentally assumed the same appearance, but with the primitive possessions of the Semitic family of speech. We therefore maintain:\n\n1. The Assyrian Present (*iq\u00e1tal*) and the Ethiopic Imperfect (*y\u0119q\u00e4t\u0113l*) are no new formations, but the oldest verbal forms of the Semitic family of speech.\n\n2. The common Semitic Perfect is a new formation from the participle, which has not yet been developed in Assyrian into a stereotyped tense. The Assyrian has not lost it, a few traces of it excepted; on the contrary, these apparent vestiges of its former existence are really the fresh nucleus of a form the growth of which we can watch.\n\n3. Similarly the Passives with internal vowel-change have not been lost in Assyrian, but are not yet developed. Here, too, we may clearly discover the first beginnings of a new form which owes its origin to an arbitrary differentiation.\n\n4. Assyrian is the Sanskrit of the Semitic idioms, Ethiopic ranking next to it in point of antiquity.\n\nIf these four axioms can be satisfactorily established, the\nwhole structure of Semitic morphology, constructed, as it has been, with so much pains, will be simply overthrown, and a thorough revision of Semitic philology, and therewith of all Semitic grammars, will have to follow. Here, again, Assyrian, to which we owe our recognition of these facts, introduces a new epoch in the study of Semitic speech.\n\nBut even without the help of Assyrian, scholars ought long ago to have seen that the Ethiopic Imperfect (\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03b5\u03c1, \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03b5\u03c1) is no new formation from the Subjunctive (\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c1). The mere comparison of the two forms (\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03b5\u03c1 and \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c1) ought of itself to have convinced every scientifically trained philologist that here, as generally elsewhere, the fuller formation is the oldest, and that the shorter form \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c1 must have been derived from the longer \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03b5\u03c1. Not a single difficulty stands in the way of such a conclusion, since \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03b5\u03c1, or rather \u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03b5\u03c1 (as it was originally pronounced), easily becomes \u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03b5\u03c1, \u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03ad\u03c1; and later\u2014when the fine instinct of language came to set apart the fuller form for the expression of the Present, the weaker for that of the Preterite\u2014\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03b5\u03c1 would have been preserved in order to mark distinctly the difference of meaning which had come to be felt.\n\nIf, on the contrary, \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03b5\u03c1 is explained according to the current view, as derived from \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c1, we must assume, with Dillmann, that the differentiation of moods, carried out with such consistency in the literary Arabic dialect (\u03b3\u03b1\u03b3\u03c4\u03cd\u03bb\u03b1, \u03b3\u03b1\u03b3\u03c4\u03cd\u03bb\u03b1, \u03b3\u03b1\u03b3\u03c4\u03cd\u03bb or rather \u03b3\u03b1\u03b3\u03c4\u03cd\u03bb), was once found in Ethiopic also, where, however, all three forms subsequently coalesced in one (\u03b3\u03b1\u03b3\u03c4\u03cd\u03bb = \u03b3\u03b1\u03b3\u03c4\u03cd\u03bb, \u03b3\u03b1\u03b3\u03c4\u03cd\u03bb). But this hypothesis, even apart from any other consideration, is at once made highly improbable by the following fact. Had Ethiopic created a new form, and that, too, a form of a very definite character, there must have been a need of it, and therefore also a living consciousness of the difference between the moods. But if the language felt it necessary to express such modal differences, it could never have come about that the phonetic characteristics and the symbols of the moods would have disappeared entirely instead of being still more distinctly\nmarked,\u00b9 and that afterwards, just as if the language had capriciously determined that the old forms no longer suited it, a new form have been created, which distinguished the moods one from the other far less clearly than the forms which had been allowed to perish.\n\nThe only possible alternative would be to assume that Ethiopic originally possessed a keen sense of the distinction between the moods, then lost it some time afterwards, but eventually recovered it. Such an alternative, however, though the only possible one, is as good as none; at all events it cannot claim to be regarded as a scientific hypothesis.\n\nThese considerations, even without the aid of Assyrian, must have led us to recognize that the Ethiopic Imperfect (y\u0113n\u0101g\u0113r) is no new formation from the Subjunctive (y\u0113ng\u0113r), but rather the form out of which the Subjunctive has grown.\n\nIf, however, y\u0113ng\u0113r, or rather yaqtul, already belongs to the parent Semitic speech, y\u0113n\u0101g\u0113r, or rather the Assyrian iq\u0101tal, must have belonged to it in a yet higher degree. This conclusion finds its most complete confirmation in the fact that Assyrian and Ethiopic agree in having the form with an accented a after the first radical, and, I repeat, cannot be based on a mere accident, but must go back to primitive Semitic influence.\n\nIn this way the theory that the Perfect in Assyrian has disappeared in the oldest literary monuments, without leaving a trace behind it, is still further shaken, or rather utterly upset; for, as we have already seen, from the point of view of scientific philology, it can only be called monstrous. In retaining iq\u0101tal among its verbal forms, Assyrian shows signs of the greatest archaism; how then could we explain the entire loss of the Perfect qatala, which occupies so prominent a place in the allied languages, and has hitherto been regarded as the starting-point of the conjugation, although Assyrian presents such a fixity of type that we cannot point to the slightest change which the language has undergone in\n\n\u00b9 Yengeru, yengera, yengeri, would perhaps have become yenger\u00fa, yengera, yengeri, as labaska, labaski, labasku, have become labaska, labaski, labasku.\nthe course of centuries? The supposition is simply impossible.\n\nIf, now, Assyrian can never have lost the Perfect, and yet does not possess one, it is clear that the common Semitic Perfect of the cognate dialects must be of later formation, and indeed later than the verbal forms found in Assyrian,\u2014later, that is, than the Imperative, Infinitive, and Participle, and, above all, later than the Present and Imperfect.\n\nSince, further, as we have seen, y\u0113n\u0101ger cannot have grown out of y\u0113nger, but, conversely, y\u0113nger is shortened from y\u0113n\u0101ger, y\u0113n\u0101ger or iy\u0101tal must be the oldest real form of the primitive Semitic verb.\n\nThese conclusions, necessarily following, as they do, one upon the other, are of themselves quite sufficient to show the facts of the case. They can, however, be supported by three important arguments.\n\n(1). The identity of the vowels in the forms of the Arabic Perfect, when contrasted with their variety in the forms of the Imperfect, indicate clearly the greater antiquity of the latter. All forms of the Perfect in Arabic, which is decidedly most primitive in the matter of vocalization, have the same vowel a: qatala, qattala, agtala, tugattala, etc. Here, then, we have a thorough-going regularity which points to the secondary action of analogy. When, however, we come to contrast the manifold variety of the forms of the Imperfect (yagtilu, yugatilu, yugtil, yutaytata) with this monotonous uniformity of the forms of the Perfect, every scholar who has the smallest tincture of the spirit of scientific philology must at once adjudge the palm of antiquity to the Imperfect.\n\n(2). In Arabic we have ingatala as Perfect of the seventh conjugation, with Imperfect yunqatila, iyatatala in the eighth conjugation with yagtilu, and iyagtila in the tenth conjugation with iyagtilu. Now if the Perfect went back to the Parent-Semitic, these three forms ought plainly to have been nayqatala, qat-tala (more clearly khatbala \u062d\u064e\u0637\u064e\u0628\u064e; cp. the forms with inserted i in Assyrian), and satugatala, which could\n\n---\n\n1 The only exception that could be quoted would be the older form epain, which once occurs in an inscription of Tiglat-Pileser, instead of the usual epain.\n\n2 A fuller statement of the points briefly noted here is given, which is quite sufficient for all who are acquainted with the questions discussed, will be given in three monographs, one on The Inner Fraction, a second on The Growth of the Semitic Conjugations, and a third on The Assyrian Terminologies.\nbecome either sataqtala or satqatala. But how then are we to explain the forms of the Perfect above quoted, how could inqatala, etc., originate from naqatala, naqtala (cf. \u0646\u0627\u0642\u0644\u0629)? All this only becomes clear, when we regard the Perfect as younger than the Imperfect. From y\u00e1nagatala we could easily get y\u00e1ngatala, and then anqatala; from yaqatabala, yaqtabala and iqtabala; from sataqatala, yasataqatala, yastaqatala, astaqatala, istaqatala.\n\nStill more convincing are Arabic forms of the Perfect like ittabbata (\u064a\u062a\u062b\u0628\u062a), instead of ta\u1e6dabbata. How ittabbata can come from ta\u1e6dabbata is utterly unintelligible. Quite clear and simple, on the other hand, is the following series of phonetic changes: ta\u1e6dabbata, yatatabbata, yatiabbata (\u064a\u062b\u0628\u062a), yattabbata, ittabbata.\n\n(3). The so-called Permansive forms in Assyrian, hitherto held to be the remains of the common Semitic Perfect, furnish the third argument. These \"remains,\" however, show a greater originality and power of creating new forms than does the common Semitic Perfect of the allied languages, whose relics they are supposed to be; while the common Semitic Perfect is a narrowly defined and stereotyped agglutination of participle and suffixed personal pronoun, the Assyrian has the power not only of creating the so-called Permansive by agglutinating participle and pronoun together, but of using any noun, be it substantive or adjective, for the purpose, by simply attaching to it the pronouns. The Assyrian could not merely say kabdaku 'I am glorious,' i\u0161\u0101ku 'I possess' (formed from the participle of the verbs \u05db\u05d1\u05e8 and \u05d9\u05e9\u05e2 by suffixing the personal pronoun), but also saraku 'I am king,' gisraku 'I am bold,' from the adjective gisru 'bold.'\n\nIf these formations, however, surpass the common Semitic Perfect in capacity of development, they cannot be merely its relics. The Permansive forms are no decaying formations, but formations just growing up, one of which afterwards displaced the others, so that only the stereotyped agglutination of participle and personal pronoun remained, out of which the common Semitic Perfect developed itself.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Others have indeed maintained that this form, first established by E. Hincks and A. H. Sayce, has nothing to do with the Semitic Perfect. Fr. Lenormant, in his \u00c9tudes sur quelques parties des Syllabaires cun\u00e9iformes, p. 20, note 4, says: \"Je reviendrai ailleurs sur le temps particulier du verbe assyrien, form\u00e9 du participe, auquel Hincks a donn\u00e9 le nom de permansif; ce temps existe tr\u00e8s-r\u00e9elle-\nAll this teaches us that the Perfect is a secondary formation, and that the Ethiopic Imperfect, or rather the Assyrian Present, represents the oldest form of the Semitic verb. This fact, like so many other new discoveries, has been made known to us by Assyrian, which casts fresh light on all the spheres of research on which it touches, extends the limits of grammatical investigation in the Semitic languages, and like Sanskrit in the Indo-European family of speech, is destined to become in a few years the indispensable preliminary and necessary foundation of all really scientific study of the Semitic group of tongues.\n\nNote on the Tenses of the Semitic Verb. By A. H. Sayce.\n\nThere is one point in Mr. Haupt's striking article with which I am unable to agree, and that is the statement that *y\u0101n\u0101g\u0101r*, with the accent on the first syllable, was the original pronunciation of the form which afterwards developed into the Assyrian Present. My investigations into Semitic accentuation have led me to the conclusion that the regular throwing back of the accent in Arabic is as much a departure from the primitive rule of accentuation as it is in Latin or the Aeolic dialect in Greece. The primitive Semitic accent was on the penultima; possibly, at a still earlier time, on the ultima. Assyrian and Ethiopic agree most remarkably in their rules of accentuation; and as the accent in a large proportion of cases is preserved in both on the penultima, we should have a further confirmation of Mr. Haupt's opinion that these two languages are the most conservative and archaic of the Semitic tongues. But there are traces even in our present Old Testament text that the position of the\n\nment, mais c'est \u00e0 tort, que les savants de l'\u00e9cole anglaise ont voulu le comparer au pr\u00e9t\u00e9rit des autres langues s\u00e9mitiques. Il trouve son \u00e9l\u00e9ment de comparaison et son explication dans certains emplois du pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 la expressive du pr\u00e9sent dans les deux langues. Si Lenormant ne nous a pas fait voir que sa th\u00e9orie est fausse, il faut admettre que son argumentation est fausse. Le paradigme Permansky correspond exactement au Paradigme Perfect, sp\u00e9cialement celui de l'intransitive verbe. Si Lenormant est correct, notre argumentation aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 une perte de temps, mais un simple examen des paradigmes suivants suffirait \u00e0 montrer qu'il est faux:\n\n| ASYRIAN | ETHIOPIQUE |\n|---------|-----------|\n| 3 m. *\u0161aknu* | labasa |\n| 3 f. *\u0161aknat* | labasa |\n| 2 c. *\u0161aknat* | Heb. \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05e1\u05b7\u05e2, Eth. labasa |\n| 1 c. *\u0161akna\u0161u* | labas\u016b |\n| 3 m. *\u0161aknul* | labasa |\n| 3 f. *\u0161akn\u0101* | labasa |\n\nHow Lenormant will explain *\u0161akad* from his Mishnaic forms is to me incomprehensible. The \"savants de l'\u00e9cole anglaise\" are decidedly right.\naccent in Hebrew also was once the same. Several reasons make me believe that the case-endings (-u, -i, -a) were still pronounced in Hebrew at the time when the majority of the books of the Old Testament were written down, but although final were not expressed in writing in consequence of their short quantity. Thus on Egyptian monuments as late as the period of Shishak names of places in Palestine, which end in a consonant in the Masoretic text, have u final, e.g. \u05e0\u05b0\u05d1\u05d5\u05bc\u05df = Negeb, \u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05e2\u05b5\u05dc = Baal. Even in Nehemiah (vi. 6), we find Gashmu, which is elsewhere written Geshem (ii. 19). The first part of a compound proper name, again, sometimes preserves in writing the final vowel-ending, as \u05e4\u05b6\u05bc\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5, \u05d7\u05b7\u05de\u05b0\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05d0\u05b8\u05dc (I. Chr. iv. 26). Hence the Masoretic accentuation of Hebrew words will not have its origin in the necessities of monotone, but be a survival of the primitive accent which fell upon the penultima, when the case-terminations were still pronounced.\n\nMr. Pinches has pointed out to me two new passages which complete our knowledge of the forms of the Assyrian Permansive. One is to be found in K. 575, line 27(?), where we read r\u00e2 a-na-cu ina eli la sa-as-lu-dha-cu \u2018and I moreover do not cause to rule,\u2019 sasluhdacu being the first person Sing. Permansive Shaphel of \u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05dc\u05b5\u05dd. The other occurs in K. 186, where, after the proper names S\u2019a-pi-cu, A-ka-na, La-ba-si, Za-kin-ta, and S\u2019in (sam-ma khansa \u2018five in all\u2019), we have D. P. Da-ra-ta-ai ma-a a-ni-ni \u2018natives of Dara, as aforesaid, (are) we,\u2019 and then in the next two lines na-tsa-ni \u2018we are gone forth,\u2019 and ni-ic-\u0161a-a-ni \u2018we are cut off,\u2019 where nats\u0101ni and nic\u0161\u0101ni are first persons plural of the Permansive, agreeing in form with the hypothetical forms I have proposed elsewhere. The discovery of the plural of the first personal pronoun is important, as the second character is unfortunately obliterated in the only passage in which it has hitherto been met with (Beh. i. 3). It will be noticed that Assyrian has lost the guttural aspirate (\u1e25) in the word, as is so frequently the case, and has weakened a to i according to the usual rule.\n\n1 Up to the time of Assur-bani-pal, Hebrew proper names are written on the Assyrian monuments with the final vowel attached. Thus, Hezekiah is Khaza-k\u00eey\u00e2hu, Ahab is Akhabnu (i.e. Akhabu), Jerusalem is Ursalimma (i.e. Ursalime), where the position of the accent must be noted. Conversely, Assyrian proper names, which have a final vowel in the inscriptions, are written defectively in our present Hebrew text. Thus Sinu-akhi-erba appears as \u05e1\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05d5\u05b8\u05d9\u05b0\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05b0\u05d1\u05b8\u05d4, Babilu as \u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05d1\u05b4\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5\u05bc, the Turtanu as \u05ea\u05bb\u05e8\u05b0\u05ea\u05b8\u05e0\u05b0\u05d5.\nART. XIII.\u2014Arab Metrology. II. El-Djabarty.\n\nBy M. H. Sauvaire.\n\nA year ago I had the honour of introducing to the Society M. Sauvaire's translation of Mar Eliya's treatise on weights and measures, which appeared in Vol. IX. pp. 241-313 of the Journal. In the notes to that work reference was frequently made to the treatise on the Balance by Hasan El-Jabarti. Since then M. Sauvaire has completed a translation of a portion of the treatise, and has entrusted to me the agreeable office of presenting this new contribution to the Society.\n\nThe present translation consists entirely of that part of El-Jabarti's work which treats of the various values of the measures of weight employed in Muslim countries, and the modes of converting weights expressed in the terms of one place into those of another. The extract occupies fol. 34-45 of the MS., which is preserved in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale at Paris; the rest of the MS., which in all contains only 48 folios, is concerned with a distinct subject\u2014\"L'auteur y \u00e9tudie,\" M. Sauvaire writes, \"la composition de la romaine (\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0629), \u00e9num\u00e8re les divers \u00e9l\u00e9ments dont est instrument se compose en en donnant la description, et indique m\u00eame les moyens d'en corriger au besoin les d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9s.\" I am happy to say that M. Sauvaire hopes at a future time to accomplish the translation of this other portion of the work, and thus to present El-Jabarti's El-'Ikl ath-them\u00edn, or \"High-priced Necklace,\" in its entirety. In the meantime the portion now offered to the Society is sufficient, both in importance and in length, for one article in the Journal.\n\nBelgravia Mansions, S.W.\n\nStanley Lane Poole.\n\nJun. 23, 1878.\n\nLe Collier de prix touchant ce qui concerne les balances.

Maqr\u00eez\u00ee, Monast\u00e8re, p. 10 de la trad. de Sacy.\nce moyen qu'on obtient les \u00e9talons (sandj) dont on se sert, au nombre de quinze, savoir :\n\nCinq \u00e9talons pour les fractions, c'est-\u00e0-dire l'\u00e9talon de la habbah, celui des deux habbah, celui d'un demi-sixi\u00e8me (de metq\u00e2l), celui d'un sixi\u00e8me et celui de la moiti\u00e9 ;\u2014\n\nTrois pour les unit\u00e9s des metq\u00e2ls ; ce sont : l'\u00e9talon du metq\u00e2l, celui de deux metq\u00e2ls et celui de cinq ;\u2014\n\nTrois pour les dizaines, de m\u00eame ;\u2014\n\nTrois pour les centaines, de m\u00eame ; et un seul \u00e9taion pour les mille metq\u00e2ls.\n\nOn proc\u00e8de de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re \u00e0 la composition des derhams. Ils sont en effet r\u00e9gl\u00e9s sur ce pied, que chaque sept metq\u00e2ls forment dix derhams. Chaque derham se composant de soixante habbah (graines), il s'en suit n\u00e9cessairement que chacune des habbah du derham \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 soixante-dix graines de moutarde. Quand on a fait exactement l'\u00e9talon de poids d'une habbah, on obtient, avec celui-ci et les (soixante-dix) graines de moutarde, un \u00e9taion de deux habbah, puis un autre encore pour les deux habbah. On fait alors, au moyen des trois \u00e9talons, un seul \u00e9taion qui sera celui du g\u00eer\u00e2t ou du demi-sixi\u00e8me du derham. Avec le tout, on obtient l'\u00e9talon du sixi\u00e8me (du derham), qui est l'\u00e9talon du d\u00e2neg.\n\n[fo. 36r.] En suite, avec tout ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, on fait l'\u00e9talon du tiers, puis de la moiti\u00e9, puis du derham. Apr\u00e8s quoi on compose les \u00e9talons qui suivent jusqu'\u00e0 mille (derhams), dans l'ordre ci-devant indiqu\u00e9 pour les metq\u00e2ls.\n\nPuisque le derham est \u00e9gal aux sept-dixi\u00e8mes du metq\u00e2l, et le metq\u00e2l \u00e0 un derham et trois septi\u00e8mes de derham, les dix derhams p\u00e8seront sept metq\u00e2ls et les dix metq\u00e2ls, quatorze derhams et deux septi\u00e8mes de derham.\n\nDu derham et du metq\u00e2l d\u00e9coule, entre autres, la contenance (megd\u00e2r) de la mesure de capacit\u00e9 (meyy\u00e2l).

Cette valeur du ratl nous est \u00e9galement fournie par celui du meud\u00e2l. En effet 2 x 130 (ratl de Bagdad) = 260, et de m\u00eame 195 - 1/4 (ratl de M\u00e9dine et tiers) = 260.\n\n5 Le Moghr\u00e8b fit l'ogiyah (Hadj), Kh\u00e2lid ibn Zayd, p. 648, No. 12469, grand ouvrage de lexiconologie, \u00e0 partir aussi d'Abou'l faith Nasr el 'Abd es-Sayyed el Mottarcey, qui mourut en l'ann\u00e9e 619 (comm. 23 mai 1213).\nLe tassou\u00e9dj \u00e9gale deux habbah.\\(^1\\)\n\nLa habbah est [fo. 36v.] un sixi\u00e8me de dixi\u00e8me\\(^2\\) du derham.\n\nTelles sont les \u00e9valuations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9es (\u00e0 ces poids).\n\nIl y a \u00e0 observer que ce que nous avons dit ci-dessus, d\u2019apr\u00e8s Eliy\u00e1, \u00e0 savoir que le q\u00eer\u00e2t est \u00e9gal \u00e0 un demi-sixi\u00e8me de derham, donne n\u00e9cessairement pour le (poids du) tassou\u00e9dj une habbah et demie, et non deux habbah. Mais d\u2019apr\u00e8s ce qu\u2019on va voir, il r\u00e9sulte que le q\u00eer\u00e2t du ratl en est le demi-sixi\u00e8me, ce qui le fait \u00e9gal \u00e0 une demi-once; et que le q\u00eer\u00e2t du derham est le demi-huiti\u00e8me de celui-ci. Toutefois c\u2019est l\u00e0 une pratique particuli\u00e8re \u00e0 la perception de la capitation;\\(^3\\) car on est convenu, dans ce cas, de regarder le derham comme compos\u00e9 de seize q\u00eer\u00e2ts et le metq\u00e2l de vingt-quatre; mais nous trouvons dans la Sunnah\\(^4\\) qu\u2019il n\u2019y a que vingt q\u00eer\u00e2ts dans le metq\u00e2l, et quatorze dans le derham.\\(^5\\) Qu\u2019on fasse donc bien attention \u00e0 cela.\n\nLe qadh p\u00e8se quatre cent quarante-deux derhams et six septi\u00e8mes de derham.\n\nLe rub\\(^6\\) \u00e9gale quatre qadh (aqd\u00e2h); son poids est donc de mille sept cent soixante et onze derhams et trois septi\u00e8mes.\\(^6\\)\n\nSache encore que la diversit\u00e9 des ratls, qui se composent d\u2019un plus ou moins grand nombre de derhams, provient de la vari\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u2019offrent les objets \u00e0 peser, plus pr\u00e9cieux ou plus vils les uns que les autres. Ainsi l\u2019huile ne saurait \u00eatre soumise \u00e0 la m\u00eame r\u00e8gle que l\u2019extrait royal, bien que l\u2019un et l\u2019autre soient des substances huileuses, pas plus qu\u2019on n\u2019assimilera l\u2019alo\u00e8s au bois \u00e0 br\u00fbler, quoiqu\u2019ils soient du bois l\u2019un et l\u2019autre.

Ainsi ce qui a beaucoup de prix se p\u00e8se avec le derham et le metq\u00e2l, et ce qui est \u00e0 bas prix est pes\u00e9 en quintaux et en rats. Tel \u00e9tant l'\u00e9tat des choses, il nous faut savoir convertir les rats les uns dans les autres, suivant le besoin. C'est pourquoi [fo. 37r.] nous dirons :\n\nLa m\u00e9thode de conversion est celle-ci :\nTu multiplies le nombre des rats \u00e0 convertir par les derhams de leur rat ; puis tu divises le produit par les derhams du rat en lequel tu veux convertir : les unit\u00e9s du quotient de la division, avec leur marf\u00fb\u00fbt, repr\u00e9sentent des rats. Multiplie ensuite le reste de la division (monh\u00e2tt\u00ee) par douze, (nombre des) onces du rat : les unit\u00e9s du produit seront des onces, et le reste sera une fraction d'once. Multiplie cette fraction par douze, par exemple, (nombre des) derhams qui composent l'once \u00e9gyptienne, les unit\u00e9s du produit expriment des derhams, et le reste sera une fraction de derham. Multiplie-la par seize, (nombre des) q\u00eer\u00e2ts du derham, les unit\u00e9s du produit repr\u00e9senteront des q\u00eer\u00e2ts du derham, et le reste une fraction de q\u00eer\u00e2t. Prends alors le rapport de cette fraction au q\u00eer\u00e2t ; puis aligne ensemble les unit\u00e9s, d'apr\u00e8s l'ordre qu'elles doivent occuper : ce sera la r\u00e9ponse et l'on aura ce qu'on cherchait.\n\nExemple. Nous voulons convertir le qent\u00e2r Syrien en Mersy (de Mers).\n\nNous multiplions le qent\u00e2r du premier par le nombre de derhams d'un seul de ses rats, \u00e9gal \u00e0 $9^2 \\cdot 52^2 \\cdot 30^2$. Le produit de la multiplication est $16^2 \\cdot 27^2 \\cdot 30^2$. Ensuite nous\n\n1. Litt. \"le premier des ordres de . . . \"\n2.

Litt. \"Ce qui vient apr\u00e8s.\"\n6. Le verbe est \u00e0 la IIe forme.\n7. L'exemple qui suit fera comprendre parfaitement la marche de l'op\u00e9ration.\n8. L'auteur se sert du syst\u00e8me sexag\u00e9simal.

Nous le multiplions [fo. 37v.] par douze, (nombre des) derhams de l'once (\u00e9gyptienne), le produit est $6\u00b0$ ; ce chiffre repr\u00e9sente des derhams. Si, apr\u00e8s cela, il y avait encore un reste, nous le multiplierions par seize, c'est-\u00e0-dire par les q\u00eer\u00e2ts du derham : les unit\u00e9s obtenues seraient des q\u00eer\u00e2ts, et le (nouveau) reste, s'il y en avait un, serait une fraction de q\u00eer\u00e2t. Nous alignons ensuite les unit\u00e9s de chaque ordre de ces produits : elles constituent la r\u00e9ponse qui, dans notre exemple, est $6\u00b0 51'$ (ratls) $5\u00b0 6^d$ ; cette expression num\u00e9rale d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e donne $411' 5\u00b0 6^d$.

Ce rapport s\u2019obtient en divisant cinq par douze.\n\nSache aussi que le qent\u00e2r Syrien, bien que son ratl soit de six cents derhams, se compose cependant, par rapport aux ratls mesryls, de quatre cent onze ratls (mesryls) et cinq onces et demie. Il s\u2019ensuit que relativement aux poids mesryls, le ratl Syrien contient cinq cent quatre-vingt-douze derhams et demi ;\u2075 c\u2019est pourquoi nous avons multipli\u00e9 par $9\u00b0 52\u00b0 30'$. S\u2019il n\u2019en \u00e9tait pas ainsi, les r\u00e8gles fondamentales auraient exig\u00e9 qu\u2019on multipli\u00e2t par $10\u00b0$, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire dix complets,\u2076\n\n\u00b9 Voir la table ci-apr\u00e8s, page 275.\n\u00b2 Je lis: \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u062d\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0630\u0644\u0643.\n\u00b3 \u0648\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062e\u0641\u0649 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0643.\n\u2074 Nous ferons observer ici une fois pour toutes qu\u2019El Djabarty n\u2019accompagne ses lettres num\u00e9rales d\u2019aucune signe qui indique quelle valeur sexag\u00e9simale il leur attribue.\n\u2075 C\u2019est sans doute une anomalie consacr\u00e9e par l\u2019usage.\n\u2076 \u0643\u0627\u0645\u0644\u0629, par opposition \u00e0 $9\u00b0 52\u00b0 30'$.\ncomme cela a lieu quand on convertit le (gentar) Syrien en tout autre (gentar) que l'Egyptien. Fais donc attention.\n\nTu ne dois pas ignorer non plus que le qirat de tout ratl est toujours une demi-once. Si donc tu divises les derhams de quelque ratl que ce soit par vingt-quatre, le quotient sera le qirat de ce ratl. Quand, apr\u00e8s avoir bien grav\u00e9 cette r\u00e8gle dans ton esprit, tu multiplieras le qirat du (ratl) \u00e0 convertir par son gentar, c'est-\u00e0-dire par cent ratsls, et que tu diviseras ensuite le produit [fo. 38r.] par le qirat du (ratl) en lequel tu convertis, tu auras la solution cherch\u00e9e, comme (tu l'as obtenu) en premier (lieu).\n\nExemple. Nous divisons 9\u00b0 52\u00b0 30', qui sont les derhams du ratl syrien, relativement \u00e0 l'Egyptien, par 24\u00b0; le quotient est 24\u00b0 41' 15\"; c'est le qirat de ce ratl. Ensuite nous multiplions ce quotient par 1\u00b0 40\", c'est-\u00e0-dire cent: le produit est 41\u00b0 8' 45\". Nous divisons maintenant ce produit par 6\u00b0, c'est-\u00e0-dire six, chiffre repr\u00e9sentant le qirat du ratl mesry en lequel on convertit : le quotient de la division est 6\u00b0 51' 27\" 30\" ou, avec le d\u00e9veloppement, quatre cent onze (ratsls) et cinq onces et demie, comme pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment : ce qui est la solution cherch\u00e9e.\n\nAutre exemple. Nous voulons convertir cinquante ratls mesry en ratls de Fatwah.\n\nNous multiplions cinquante par six: le produit est trois cent. Ensuite nous divisons ce produit par le qirat du (ratl) de Fatwah, qui est quinze : le quotient est vingt, en ratsls Fatwah.\n\nDe m\u00eame si tu divises le qirat du (ratl) \u00e0 convertir, c'est-\u00e0-dire 24\u00b0 41' 15\" par le qirat de celui en lequel tu convertis, c'est-\u00e0-dire six ; qu'ensuite tu multiplies le quotient\n\n1 Nous traduisons quelquefois mesry par \"Egyptien.\" Cependant nous devons faire observer que cet adjectif signifie exactement \"de Misr,\" appellation qui s'applique tant \u00e0 l'Egypte qu'\u00e0 sa capitale. C'est d'ailleurs qu'il n'y avait pas une livre commune \u00e0 toute l'Egypte, mais que bien des localit\u00e9s avaient la leur. Il faut donc entendre par poids mesry celui en usage dans la capitale Misr.\n\n2 Qirat (ou 24me) du ratl mesry. 144 = 6 derhams.\n\n3 Nous aurions \u00e9galement, par la premi\u00e8re m\u00e9thode, 50 x 144 = 20.\n4\u00b0 6' 52'' 30''' par le qent\u00e2r du (ratl) \u00e0 convertir, \u00e9gal \u00e0 1\u00b0 40', c'est-\u00e0-dire cent, le produit sera 6\u00b0 51' 27'' 30''. Op\u00e8re \u00e0 son \u00e9gard comme pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, tu auras ce que tu cherches.\n\nDe m\u00eame encore, si tu multiplies le q\u00eer\u00e2t du (ratl) \u00e0 convertir par 1\u00b0 40', et qu'ensuite tu divises le produit par le q\u00eer\u00e2t du (ratl) en lequel tu convertis, le quotient donnera la solution cherch\u00e9e.\u00b9\n\nSi nous voulons convertir le mesry en Syrien, nous ferons l'op\u00e9ration inverse : nous multiplierons cent ratls par les derhams du ratl \u00e9gyptien ; puis nous diviserons le produit par les derhams du ratl syrien. Nous aurons en quotient les ratls et leur fraction. Nous multiplierons ensuite la fraction par douze, nombre des onces du ratl syrien : le \"premier des ordres\" du produit sera des onces et ce qui le suit, une fraction d'once. [fo. 39r.] Op\u00e8re \u00e0 son \u00e9gard comme pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, tu auras ce que tu cherches.\n\nAutre mani\u00e8re. Tu divises la fraction par le rapport de l'once au ratl ; ce rapport est un demi-sixi\u00e8me. Tu obtiendras les onces et leur fraction. Puis tu multiplies la fraction de l'once par les derhams de l'once du ratl en lequel tu convertis : le \"premier des ordres\" du produit sera des derhams, et ce qui vient apr\u00e8s, une fraction de derham. Multiplie cette fraction par les seize q\u00eer\u00e2ts du derham : les \"unit\u00e9s du premier ordre\"\u00b2 du produit seront des q\u00eer\u00e2ts entiers, et ce qui vient apr\u00e8s exprimera une fraction de q\u00eer\u00e2t. Tu prends le rapport de cette fraction au q\u00eer\u00e2t. Enfin tu alignes ensemble toutes les unit\u00e9s de ces divers ordres,\u00b3 comme pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment. Tu auras la r\u00e9ponse.\n\nExemple. Nous multiplions 1\u00b0 40' par 2\u00b0 24' : le produit est 4\u00b0. Nous divisons ensuite ce produit par 9\u00b0 52' 30' : nous avons comme quotient 24\u00b0 18' 13'' 5''' 15''', c'est-\u00e0-dire vingt-quatre ratls et une fraction. Puis nous divisons cette fraction par le rapport de l'once au ratl, soit un demi-sixi\u00e8me, ou 5':\n\n\u00b9 En effet $\\frac{41\u00b0 8' 46''}{6} = 41\u00b0 21' 27'' 30''$.\n\u00b2 Litt. \"le premier des ordres.\"\n\u00b3 \u062b\u0645 \u062a\u0648\u0642\u0641 \u0628\u064a\u0646 \u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u0626\u0644.\nle quotient est trois onces et une fraction d'once, ainsi : $3\u00b0\\ \\frac{38'}{44''}\\ 3''$, c'est-\u00e0-dire trois onces et une fraction. Nous multiplions cette fraction par les derhams de l'once, que nous obtenons de la division de son rati, \u00e9gal \u00e0 $9\u00b0\\ \\frac{52'}{30''}$, par $12'$, et qui sont $49\u00b0\\ \\frac{22'}{30''}$ ; le produit est $31\u00b0\\ \\frac{52'}{29''}\\ \\frac{58''}{7''\\ 30''}$. Les \u201cunit\u00e9s du premier ordre\u201d sont trente-un derhams; et ce qui vient apr\u00e8s, si nous le multiplions par le nombre (meqddar) des qir\u00e2ts du derham, c'est-\u00e0-dire seize, donne comme produit $13\u00b0\\ \\frac{59'}{59''}$ $30''$. Les \u201cunit\u00e9s du premier ordre\u201d sont treize, c'est-\u00e0-dire les qir\u00e2ts. En for\u00e7ant ce qui vient apr\u00e8s (c'est-\u00e0-dire la fraction) pour (parfaire) un qir\u00e2t, nous aurons quatorze qir\u00e2ts, et la r\u00e9ponse sera alors $24\u00b0\\ \\frac{3'}{31''}\\ \\frac{14''}{14''}$, c'est-\u00e0-dire vingt-quatre rats, trois onces, trente-un derhams et quatorze qir\u00e2ts.\n\nL'emploi de la multiplication par douze, au lieu de la division [fo., 39v.] par cinq, convient mieux pour obtenir la solution cherch\u00e9e. Toute l'op\u00e9ration se fait alors par le m\u00e9thode de la multiplication. Fais donc attention.\n\nEn somme, la r\u00e8gle fondamentale est celle-ci : Tu multiplies les derhams du rat \u00e0 convertir par ses rats, et tu divises le produit par les derhams du rat en lequel tu convertis ; les \u201cunit\u00e9s du premier ordre\u201d du quotient de la division, avec leur fraction (marfioud), s'il y en a une, expriment des rats. Puis tu multiplies la fraction qui vient apr\u00e8s par douze, nombre des onces du rati ; les \u201cunit\u00e9s du premier ordre\u201d du produit expriment des onces. Tu multiplies ensuite ce qui vient apr\u00e8s par les derhams dont se compose l'once, suivant son rati ; les \u201cunit\u00e9s du premier ordre\u201d du produit sont des derhams. Ensuite tu multiplies par les seize qir\u00e2ts du derham ; les \u201cunit\u00e9s du premier ordre\u201d du produit repr\u00e9sentent des qir\u00e2ts, et ce qui vient apr\u00e8s, une fraction de qir\u00e2t. Prends le rapport de cette fraction au qir\u00e2t. Enfin rassemble ces diff\u00e9rentes unit\u00e9s dans leur ordre ; elles constitueront la r\u00e9ponse.\n\n1 L'auteur a successivement employ\u00e9 pour signifier \"nombre,\" les mots \u0629\u064e\u0627\u064e\u062f\u060c \u0639\u064e\u0631\"\u060c \u0648\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0651\u0646\".\n2 C'est-\u00e0-dire, par le nombre de rats contenus dans un qir\u00e2t.\nSache encore que les derhams du ratl d\u2019une ville quelconque, multipli\u00e9s par cent, donnent son qent\u00e2r, et, divis\u00e9s par douze, les derhams des onces de ce ratl. En divisant l\u2019once en deux moiti\u00e9s, on obtient le q\u00eer\u00e2t du ratl, de m\u00eame que si on divise le ratl par vingt-quatre. Et si tu multiplies\u00b9 le derham par seize, le produit te donne le (nombre de) q\u00eer\u00e2ts contenus dans le derham. D\u2019apr\u00e8s cela, le q\u00eer\u00e2t du ratl est le quart du sixi\u00e8me de celui-ci, et le q\u00eer\u00e2t du derham est le demi-huiti\u00e8me de ce dernier.\u00b2\n\nSi tu r\u00e9fl\u00e9chis \u00e0 ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, tu sauras que cela revient \u00e0 dire que le rapport d\u2019une once \u00e0 une autre est comme le rapport du qent\u00e2r \u00e0 l\u2019autre qent\u00e2r.\n\nD\u00e9monstration. L\u2019once \u00e9gyptienne se compose de douze derhams, et l\u2019once syrienne contient cinquante derhams : le rapport de douze \u00e0 cinquante \u00e9tant un cinqui\u00e8me et un cinqui\u00e8me de cinqui\u00e8me, le rapport du qent\u00e2r mesry au qent\u00e2r syrien sera de m\u00eame un cinqui\u00e8me et un cinqui\u00e8me de cinqui\u00e8me. Le qent\u00e2r mesry sera donc \u00e9gal \u00e0 vingt-quatre ratls [fo. 40r.] syriens.\n\nEn abr\u00e9g\u00e9ant, je dirai : le rapport d\u2019un qent\u00e2r \u00e0 un autre qent\u00e2r est \u00e9gal au rapport du q\u00eer\u00e2t (du ratl du premier) au q\u00eer\u00e2t (du ratl du second). Le q\u00eer\u00e2t mesry est de six derhams, et le syrien de vingt-cinq derhams : le rapport de six \u00e0 vingt-cinq est un cinqui\u00e8me et un cinqui\u00e8me de cinqui\u00e8me ; il en sera donc de m\u00eame du qent\u00e2r mesry par rapport au syrien.\n\nLe rapport du q\u00eer\u00e2t mesry au q\u00eer\u00e2t Fo\u00fbwy,\u2014lequel contient quinze derhams,\u2014est deux cinqui\u00e8mes : le qent\u00e2r mesry compar\u00e9 au qent\u00e2r de Fo\u00fbwah, sera donc \u00e9gal \u00e0 quarante ratls de Fo\u00fbwah.\u2074 Il n\u2019est pas douteux en effet que : quarante ne soient les deux cinqui\u00e8mes de cent.\n\nLe rapport du q\u00eer\u00e2t (du ratl) de Fo\u00fbwah au q\u00eer\u00e2t (du ratl) syrien est trois cinqui\u00e8mes ; il en sera donc de m\u00eame du rapport du qent\u00e2r de Fo\u00fbwah au qent\u00e2r de Syrie, et con-\n\n\u00b9 Le texte porte : \u201cSi tu divises :\u201d mais c\u2019est une erreur \u00e9vidente du copiste.\n\u00b2 En d\u2019autres termes, le ratl se divise en 24 q\u00eer\u00e2ts (de ratl), et le derham en 16 q\u00eer\u00e2ts (de derham).\n\u00b3 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0648\u064e\u0642\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0629\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0645\u0650\u0635\u0652\u0631\u0650\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0629\u064f.\n\u2074 En effet $100 M = 100 F \\times \\frac{3}{8} = 40 F$.\ns\u00e9quemment le qent\u00e2r de Fouwah \u00e9galera soixante ratls syriens.\\(^1\\)\n\nLe moyen le plus commode pour r\u00e9soudre ce probl\u00e8me est celui que nous venons d\u2019indiquer, savoir : multiplier le q\u00eer\u00e2t du (ratl) \u00e0 convertir par son qent\u00e2r et diviser le produit par le q\u00eer\u00e2t du (ratl) en lequel on convertit.\n\nJ\u2019ai vu, \u00e0 propos de ces ing\u00e9nieux probl\u00e8mes \\(^2\\) des tables \\(^3\\) dont toutefois le contenu avait \u00e9t\u00e9 tellement d\u00e9figur\u00e9 par les copistes que personne ne les consultait plus, \u00e0 cause de leur peu d\u2019exactitude.\\(^4\\) Force m\u2019a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 de la refaire, afin qu\u2019elles pussent de nouveau \u00eatre consult\u00e9es.\\(^5\\) Les voici figur\u00e9es :\n\n\\(^1\\) On a en effet \\( \\frac{360}{600} = \\frac{3}{5} \\), et \\( 100 F = 100 S \\times \\frac{3}{5} = 60 S \\).\n\n\\(^2\\) El Djabarty r\u00e9pand ici quelques fleurs de rh\u00e9torique orientale.

Lors donc qu'on consid\u00e8re le rapport du ratl \u00e0 soixante, l'once est cinq, vu que ce nombre est le demi-sixi\u00e8me de soixante, car il est le quotient de la division de soixante par douze. Si tu divises les cinq par douze, le derham mesry de l'once sera 25 : c'est ce qu'on appelle la part\u00b2 du derham. Si tu divises ensuite la part du derham, c'est-\u00e0-dire 25', par seize, qui sont le nombre des q\u00eer\u00e2ts du derham, le quotient sera 1' 38\" 45\"' : ce nombre est la part du q\u00eer\u00e2t. L\u00e0 s'arr\u00eate la division du ratl et de ses parties.\n\nC'est d'apr\u00e8s ces principes que j'ai dress\u00e9 les tables qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent. Lorsque la division des ratls \u00e0 convertir donne un reste et que tu veux savoir combien d'onces il repr\u00e9sente, cherche-le dans la table\u00b3 du rapport de l'once au ratl : tu trouveras le chiffre auquel il correspond. Puis si apr\u00e8s cela, il y a encore un reste, cherche celui-ci dans la table du rapport du derham \u00e0 l'once : tu trouveras la quantit\u00e9 de derhams entiers (qu'il repr\u00e9sente). Si, apr\u00e8s cette op\u00e9ration, il y a encore un reste, cherche-le dans la table du rapport du q\u00eer\u00e2t au derham, tu trouveras les q\u00eer\u00e2ts entiers. Enfin s'il se pr\u00e9sente encore un reste, apr\u00e8s cette derni\u00e8re op\u00e9ration, prends-en le rapport au q\u00eer\u00e2t.

XIV.\u2014The Migrations and Early History of the White Huns; principally from Chinese Sources. By THOS. W. KINGS MILL.\n\nOne of the most interesting migrations on record is that of the Yueh-ti from their old seats in the north-west of China to the site of the Greek kingdom of Bactria. Its interest is increased rather than diminished by the fact that we can trace its origin by the aid of authentic records, as well as from the knowledge that it was but one in a series, the original exciting cause of which still remains veiled in an obscurity apparently only to be pierced, on the one hand, by the geologist who shall work out the changes in the physical geology of Asia, within the human period, or, on the other, by the comparative mythologist, who, placing side by side the myths and traditions of its ancient inhabitants, sees, though dimly, some sort of order rising out of what, at first sight, is a veritable chaos.\n\nThe march of the Yueh-ti from Kansuh to Bactria was, perhaps, one of the latest of these remarkable changes, though accomplished in a much shorter time than any of those which inundated Western Asia and Europe. The causes which induced it had been long at work, and it is the more noteworthy that it took place in a direction contrary to all previous movements of a similar kind, viz. east of the Pamir. It cannot, therefore, be considered independently of the two events, which more immediately led to the relinquishment of their ancient seats by the inhabitants of Kansuh, viz., the establishment of the Chinese power, and the continued pressure of the Turkish tribes.\n\nWhen the original founders of the Chinese polity, the Chow (or rather the Djows), after having been driven out of their territory at Ban, had crossed the Liang-shan (or Pamir),\n\n1. Liang-shan or Tsung-shan are two names identical in origin and vary only dialectically. The original root was Dar, which probably survives to the present day in Bardistan, etc.\nand had found a temporary relief from the attacks of their relentless foes, the Diks, at the foot of the present Tien shan, they transferred to their new seats many traditions and myths, the common property of the old Aryans of Central Asia. On the southern slopes of the mountains they founded the settlement of Ki-djow, and, in it, there sprang up a new crop of myths and legends; and, again, the daylight legends of the ever-present Twine (the Dioskuri of the Greeks), which, in Chinese, by the ordinary phonetic changes, reappear in the stories of the Djow Kung\\(^1\\) and Wu-wang, leap into fresh life. Here, too, we find the equally persistent tales of the original founder of the Aryans\u2014Manu, Minos, Mannus, or, as in Chinese, Man or Wan.\n\nIt is in connexion with the last that we first meet with traces of the Viddhals, as I shall, for reasons below stated, call the original tribe of the White Huns or Ephthalitae of the later Greek writers.\n\nThe third part of the Shi King, or Book of Poetry, is mainly occupied with the old traditions of the Djows. The seventh ode of the first book describes the foundation of the new settlement. The immigrants clear away the woods which they find upon the southern slopes of the Tien shan, and prepare the land for cultivation; the savage hordes, the Ch\u00fbn-i\\(^2\\) (or D\u00e2navas) fly before the new-comers, who establish a kingdom in the plains of Ki. Man comes to the throne and organizes the rising state. He is not, however, unmolested; the people of Mat appear on the scene and refuse to recognize him.\n\nThe men of Mat did not submit:\nThey dared to oppose the great state;\nThey plundered the entire of Yuen.\nThe king was majestic in his wrath.\nHe set in order his troops,\nTo stop the advancing enemy;\nTo ensure the prosperity of Djow;\nTo bring into harmony the kingdom.\n\n\\(^1\\) Djow from root Dyo; Kung = Cur, Gr. \u03ba\u1fe6\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2.\n\\(^2\\) Erroneously translated by Dr. Legge, Chinese Classics, vol. iv., as the Kwan hordes.\nThey resolved to attack us in our capital.\nInvading us from the borders of Yuen,\nTo scale our lofty heights.\nThey shot no arrows on our hills,\nOur hills nor ridges.\nThey drank not of our wells,\nOur wells nor fountains.\n(Our king) then marched into the plains,\nWe fixed our dwellings south of Mount Ki,\nAlong the banks of the Wei;\nA site for a myriad states,\nA king for a glorious people!\n\nIt is difficult here to define where myth ends or legend begins. The character made use of for Mat, with a variation not affecting its pronunciation, stands also for 'honey.' The word is, in fact, the equivalent of a series running through nearly all the Aryan languages from the east of Asia to the west of Europe. Thus we have Sans. madhu; Gr. \u03bc\u03ad\u03b4\u03c9\u03bd; Zend. madhu; English mead, etc. We may, therefore, assume that the ancient final in Chinese was dh, and that the word was pronounced by the Djowas as Madhu. This at once brings it into connexion with the Indian legend, in which Vishnu, or Krishna, kills the demon Madhu\u2014the Danava, or one of the Rakshassas, who was plotting to kill Brahma. The legend of Krishna and the Rakshassas has, generally, been assumed to preserve the recollection of some primeval contest of the Aryans with the aboriginal tribes.\n\nHowever this may be, the word clung to Chinese tradition, hence, we find, when the tales of Djow are becoming hardened into authentic history, a kingdom of Mat or Mat-s\u016b. S\u016b, the beard, the cirri of fish, the stamens of plants, etc., is connected with the root dal, findi; so that, in the modern Mats\u016b, we have to read Madbdal, or the more pronounceable Maddhal. The country of Madh or Maddhal comprised mainly the eastern part of the present province of Kanseub, extending as far as the river King, a tributary of the Wei, a river flowing past Singhan-fu, the capital of the northern province of Shensi.\n\nAccording to the generally received chronology, the contest of Man with the Madhs must have taken place in the\ntwelfth century B.C. The Djows were not long to enjoy their new settlement, for, in the next generation, still apparently pressed from the west, we find them encroaching on the tribes, which had preceded them in China proper: Wu-wang and his brother Djow-gung overthrow the Yins, and establish the seat of government at Fung near the present Singhan-fu in Shensi. Even here they find little rest. The defeated scions of the Yins incite the people from the west to attack the new state; the Djows are not strong enough to hold their own, and have, therefore, once more, to move eastward and fix their capital at Lok, near the site of the present Honan-fu in Honan province.\n\nWith varying success in their new home, the Djows succeed in the main in establishing a sort of pre-eminence amongst the other States, most of whom claim a descent from the elder house of Djow. Their last movement has separated them for a time from their old enemies the Madhs; of whom we hear no more till the time of King Kung, whose reign is assigned to the middle of the tenth century B.C.\n\nOur authority for these statements is the Kuoh-yu, or Conversations of the Kingdoms, a book full of quaint stories, but respectable withal in its aim, the promotion of good government, and of undeniable antiquity. The Kuoh-yu tells how the King Kung, stopping one time with the Duke of Madh, west of the river King, above mentioned as the boundary of the two kingdoms, he took a fancy to three of the Duke's concubines. The Duke's mother advised her son to let the King have the ladies; but, he refusing, a coldness sprung up. The result was that in the following year the King invaded Madh, and, according to the record, extinguished the country. I have not been able to discover any later trace of the tribe under the name of Madh.\n\nSo far we have had little more than the dim light of comparative mythology to guide us, for even King Kung can scarcely be considered to have lived within the period of authentic history. Though Indian legend, in its later development, carries the fable of Madhu as far as Lanka, the coincidences with the Chinese are too close to permit us to assign independent origins to the two. Both the Indian\nand Chinese Aryans may be traced back by their traditions to the table-land of Central Asia. According to the unanimous tradition of the Chinese, the tribe of the Djows was driven from its original seat in the land of Ban (? Varend of Iranian lore) by the irruptions of barbarous tribes. They are usually called by the general name of Diks, but in the Book of Poetry this name is particularized under the title of Hinyuk or Hundjuk, standing apparently for Hundik. Allied with these tribes are the Himwans (Hien-yun of modern Chinese). Both of these tribes are by the early Han writers connected with the Jung of the Djow authors; a name, which, by the time of the Hans, had become changed to N\u00fc in the title of the Hiung-nu, or Kara-Nurs. These latter were by De Guignes identified with the Huns, an erroneous opinion which has led to much confusion, and which, notwithstanding that Klapproth pointed out the true affinities of the Hiung-nu, as being the original stock of the Turks, continues to the present day to confuse the pages of ancient history.\n\nThe Jung are frequently by the old writers called the Dik jung or Jung dik, and the character for Dik itself \u72d7 'dog' placed by the side of 'fine,' seems to point to some connexion with the old Aryan myth of the Azhi Dahaka. In the 6th century A.D., when the Turks again make their appearance in history, the Chinese have found a new name for them, as Duh-kueh. The persistence of the phonetic element as dik, duk, or Turk; as well as the direct statements of the Chinese writers that the tribes were identified; seem to point out that the pressure of the Turkish tribes on the Aryans began at an early period in the history of the latter.\n\n1 Mencius, book i. 2. xiv., says, \"Formerly when King Tao dwelt in Pin (Ban), the barbarians of the north were continually making encroachments upon it. He therefore left it, went to the foot of Mount Ka, and there took up his residence. He did not take that situation as having selected it. It was a matter of necessity with him.\" Legge's Chinese Classics, vol. ii. p. 50, cf also pp. 437, 438, 439, and Shih King (Book of Poetry), iii. I. vii., Legge's Classics, vol. iv. p. 437.\n\n2 Shih-Ku, chap. 119. Cf. also Tsoch Han Shuo, translated by Mr. A. Wylie, Journal of Anthropological Institute, vol. ii. no. iii.\n\n3 J, the weakest of semi-vowels, is, in Chinese, constantly interchanged with n. Ny n\u00fcml was anciently, in most cases, pronounced r.\nAs above stated, the tribe of the Himwans was connected with the other Turkish tribes. They pressed more or less pertinaciously on the Djows in the early portion of their career in China: their name points to a relationship with the Komans, an acknowledged Turkish tribe, who, after the dispersal of their nation by the Han emperors of China, seem to have moved westerly round the south of the Caspian Sea, as traces of them are still to be found in Southern Russia and the Caucasus.\n\nAccording to the above view, the Mats, Madhs, or Maddhals, and the Madhu of the Indian legends, would seem to have been a tribe of non-Aryana, originally settled near the early seats of the Aryan tribes, in Central Asia. Pressed upon by the restless Turkish tribes, the two races came into hostile conflict before the setting out of the great Aryan migration to the South and East. Hence their name has been preserved in both Chinese and Indian legends.\n\nAs we have seen from the Chinese ode, they attacked the Aryan Djows in their settlements at the foot of the Tien shun. They, however, do not at any time seem to have been sufficiently powerful to make any lasting impression on the Djows, whose hard struggle for existence was with the Turkish tribes of the Himwans (Komans) and the Jung, Kiang jung or Yam jung (Kara-n\u00fbrs).\n\nAccordingly, when the Djows were finally forced to fix their capital in Honan, we find that the Madhs, also, had to make a corresponding march, and that the river King, about east longitude 108\u00b0, was at the dawn of true history the boundary between the two peoples. Tradition says that the Madhs were extinguished, but as the Djows were, at the time, falling into a state of helpless dependence on their neighbours, it is far more likely that they were separated from the Madhs by the intrusion of the Tsins, the Seres of the Romans, who, about this time, begin to appear in history, taking up their abodes in the former residences of the Djows in Shensi and Kansuh.\n\n1 Shi King (Book of Poetry), ii. 1. vii. kc. Legge's Chinese Classics, vol. iv. p. 259. Dr. Legge, in a note to the above work, gives the Chinese authorities for the connexion of the Himwans with the tribes subsequently known as the Duh-Kiueh.\nWhen the curtain of authentic history at last rises, we find the districts assigned to the kingdom of the Madha occupied by a race which, under the modern Chinese pronunciation of their name Yu\u00e8t\u00ec, has been one of the standing enigmas of ethnology. I have elsewhere explained the philological reasons which led me to restore Viddhal as the ancient pronunciation of the name. Vivien de St.-Martin was the first to point out the probable connexion of the Yu\u00e8t\u00ec with the Ephtalite, \u1f18\u03c6\u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 of Procopius; a clue which was followed up by Reinaud in his \"Relations politiques et commerciales de l'empire Romaine avec l'Asie Orientale.\" As my own identification of the name was independent of the historical reasons which had\n\n1 When engaged last year (early part of 1874) in preparing some notes on the probably recent elevation of Central Asia, I had occasion to insert some remarks with regard to the tribe handed down in Chinese history as the \u6708\u5ead (in modern Chinese Yu\u00e8t\u00ec). None of the identifications usually accepted for Greek \u1f18\u03c6\u03b8\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 tally with this characterisation of the case, and having myself without external evidence, I suspected from philological grounds alone that the word Viddhal would be found an approximation to the actual name of the tribes. I was unaware at the time that M. Vivien de St.-Martin had, in a review of the destruction of the Greco-Bactrian kingdom, from historic grounds identified the so-called Yu\u00e8t\u00ec with the White Huns, the Hauthnah, the Ephtalitae of the Greek writers, who, about the year 134 B.C., overrun that country, and finally destroyed the Greco-Bactrian dynasty which from the time of Alexander's death had been paramount. Viddhal rather than Vidal should have been the rendering of this old Chinese name, and as this name is considered an identical with the Greek name for the tribe, the Ephtalitae, as well as its Arabic form Hauthnah, it may be interesting to review the grounds on which this reconstruction of the ancient sound of the characters was founded. The characters made use of to express the name of the tribe have in their present form no meaning, they were at first only used as phonetic elements. To arrive at their archaic sounds it will be necessary, however, to analyse their separate meanings, and endeavour if possible to find an analogue in some language making use of an alphabet such as we find in Sanskrit\u2014a language having many relations with primitive Chinese. Taking then the Chinese characters separately, we find the first \u6708 \"the moon,\" in Cantonese, the nearest existing dialect, to that spoken at the beginning of Chinese history, \u6708 or Yu\u00e8t\u00ec, the second \u5ead ti, in Cantonese ten, meaning \"fundamental,\" \"radical,\" \"reaching to the ground.\" Comparing these words with Sanskrit, we find the first represented by a word siddha, with the same meaning, stop or ground, and does not mean any word analogous among Aryan languages. It may therefore be taken as a non-Aryan term for the moon which found acceptance in Sanskrit. The form ten for the second syllable seems to point to a lab. liquid vibration, l or r, more probably the former. Ten will thus agree in its original sound with the Sanskrit lat \"cloud,\" \"fondus,\" in Latin celum, in Chinese \u5929 ti \"the earth,\" \u5929 ten \"fundamental,\" etc. In analogy therefore the combination of the two characters would have been pronounced Tiddhal, Viddhal, or Vidal, thus corresponding with the actual name of the tribes as handed down from other sources. See Trans North China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, new series, no. x, Shanghai, 1876.\nled the above author to believe in the connexion of the two peoples, it is entitled to some little respect.\n\nI am further disposed to look upon the Viddhals as the Madhs or Maddhals under another title.\n\nAs is well known, the Chinese written characters are generally divided into two portions, a primitive or phonetic, more or less intended to indicate the sound, and a radical defining the class and modifying the meaning. Of such a nature is the character for Madh. Its primitive in one or two cases shows an affinity for an initial \\( f \\), as well as for \\( m \\). The two sounds were apparently not readily distinguishable. Between the time of the early Djows and the completed empire under the Hans, the language underwent such changes that, in the characters made use of for the designations of neighbouring tribes, we meet with constant substitutions. That of the modification of Jung with N\u00fc is a case in point.\n\nBefore entering on the historical narrative, it may not be out of place to refer to the origin of the Huns as related in their own traditions. Mr. H. H. Howorth,\\(^1\\) in his paper on the \"Westerly Drifting of Nomades,\" refers to the myth of the origin of the Khazars, a tribe closely allied to the Bazeleens; wherein Bizal is made the brother of Khazar, their eponymous ancestor. The Khazars themselves, prior to their western migration, are said to have come from the land of Bezelia. From Maddhal or Viddhal to Bezel is but a step, and a by no means long one. On the assumption that the Ephthalit\u00e6 really were Huns, which has been a generally received opinion, we have apparently sufficient evidence to connect the two.\n\nWe have thus, by the dim light of tradition, traced the Viddhals from their original seats in Central Asia, across the Pamir to the slopes of the Tienshun, and thence to the province of Kansuh in China. Our next step will be on the more solid ground of history.\n\nMr. Wylie, in his translation of the records of the Hiung-nu from the T'sien Han shu,\\(^2\\) describes the locality of the\n\n\\(^1\\) Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, vol. ii. no. iii.\n\n\\(^2\\) Journal of Anthropological Institute, vol. ii. no. iii.\nViddhals at the time of the accession of Shi Hwang-ti, B.C. 221. \"At that time,\" says the record, \"the Tung-hu, \u8463\u80e1, had become a formidable power, and the Yueh-ti (Viddhals), \u6708\u6c0f, were in a flourishing condition. The Shen Yu (? Dinkul or Darkul) of the Hiung-nu was named T'ou man. The latter meeting with a reverse in his contest with T'sin moved northward.\"\n\nThe previous period had been an age of internecine conflict between the various states which formed the loose aggregate of the Djow dominion; and ample opportunity had been afforded to the neighbouring tribes to consolidate their power. Tsin (Sir) had at last gained the pre-eminence, and founded the modern empire of China; and its ruler's first care was to turn his arms against the Turkish tribes, still pressing on the northern and north-western frontiers; and whose presence he saw was a real and tangible danger to the new empire. To enable his troops to keep the Turks the more effectually from encroaching, he completed a series of defensive works, already partially existing, and which extended from the extreme west of China to the gulf of Pechili. The death of his ablest general, Mungtien, however, rendered these works of little practical value, and the Turks advanced across the Yellow River to the old stockades which marked their previous limits.\n\nThe T'sien Han-shu, above quoted, describes the relative position of Chinese and Turks during the latter portion of the short-lived Tsin dynasty. Maoudun, the Shen-yu, about 206 B.C., engaged in hostilities with the Viddhals, whom he defeated.\n\nWithin the next quarter of a century the final attack on the Viddhals seems to have taken place, consequent on the success of the Chinese arms against the Turks during the early days of the Han dynasty. In the year 176 B.C. we find the Shen-yu addressing a letter to the Emperor of China requesting a renewal of the pacts already existing between the two nations. He remarks that in consequence of a raid into Chinese territory of the Right Sage prince, the Chinese generals retaliated and drove the Turkish forces into the territory of the Viddhals; while Lowlan, Wusun, Huki and\nthe adjacent kingdoms to the number of twenty-six, all submitted to the Hiung-n\u00fb. These events seem to have occurred in the previous year, 177 B.C., which may therefore be considered as the commencement of the south-westerly movement of the Viddhals.\n\nAt the time of its greatest prosperity the Viddhal dominion extended from about 95\u00b0 to 109\u00b0 east longitude, and from 36\u00b0 to 40\u00b0 north latitude; comprising, therefore, the greater part of the present province of Kansuh east of the desert of Gobi. Its population could never have been great, as it appears to have existed in a great measure on sufferance: both Chinese and Turks, however divergent in other respects, agreeing in considering the Viddhals an alien race.\n\nWhen next we meet with the Viddhals, we find them settled in Bactria. We are indebted to the Shi ki, or Historical Record, for our information on this point, and I shall follow the writer Szema Tsien in his description of the geography and ethnology of the districts lying adjacent to the table-land of Central Asia. Szema Tsien has not inaptly been styled the Father of Chinese history, and his work has deservedly served as a model for the succeeding dynastic records. Szema devoted the 123rd chapter of his work to a description of Dawan and the adjoining countries. This description is founded in the official reports of Djang-kien, a native of Han-chung, and an official under the Emperor Wu-ti of the Hans.\n\nThe story was told to the Emperor how the Hiung-n\u00fb had utterly defeated the Viddhals and had made a drinking vessel out of the skull of their king; and how, in consequence, the Viddhals had fled from their country, inspired with a lasting hatred of their oppressors, and still maintaining the hope of one day revenging themselves. He determined on sending an embassy, and, as the route to the Viddhals lay through Hiung-n\u00fb territory, asked for capable men. Djang-kien and Tang-yip were accordingly sent, and started from Lung-si (Kansuh) B.C. 138. Passing through the Hiung-n\u00fb, they were captured and taken before the Shen-yu, who detained them, saying: \"The Viddhals lie beyond us, what is the object in sending an ambassador? If\nwe wished to send a mission across China, would you consent to hear of it?\" He detained him more than ten years. Kien married and had children, but preserved his fidelity. Living in the midst of the Hiung-nu, their vigilance relaxed. With the aid of his connexions he made good his escape. Traveling westward for ten days, he arrived at Du-wan.\u00b9 Du-wan had heard of the riches and wealth of China, and was desirous of intercourse, but could not communicate. Kien was gladly received, and was asked the object of his visit. He told them that he was an envoy from China to the Viddhals, and in consequence had been detained by the Hiung-nu, but had managed to escape. If the King would send an embassy offering to submit to China, he would conduct it back, promising at the same time presents and subsidies. His words did not prevail; negotiations were closed, and Kien was sent on by the high road to Gang-gu.\u00b2\n\nGang-gu adjoined the country occupied by the great Viddhals. The King of the Viddhals, Sze \u5df2, had been killed by the Turks, and they had set up his heir in his stead. They had overcome Ta-hia \u5927\u590f\u00b3 and taken up their residence in that country, which was rich and fertile. Robbers were few; the people liked peace and comfort; they were at a distance from China, but they had rather be exterminated than submit to the Turks.\n\nFrom the Viddhals Kien went on to Ta-hia, not being able to induce the Viddhals to agree to his proposals. He was detained another year at Bing-nan-shan. He was desirous of returning by Thibet, but was again captured by the Hiung-nu, and detained a year longer till the death of the Shen-yu, B.C. 126. The Left Guk-li prince contested the succession with the heir, and the country was thrown into a state of confusion. Kien, through his Turkish wife, along with Tang-yip, escaped back to China, where they were honourably received, and promoted to high office. Of more\n\n\u00b9 Du-wan, as will appear below, seems to represent the district adjoining Kashgar and Yarkand.\n\u00b2 Gang-gu apparently the country about Karakul, possibly the Riangkul Pamir.\n\u00b3 Ta-hia, Bactria, lately overrun by the Toch\u0101ri, and subsequently known as Tocharistan.\nthan a hundred individuals who had gone out with Kien thirteen years previously, but two succeeded in getting back.\n\nDa-wan\u00b9 \u5927\u5b9b lies to the south-west of the Hiung-n\u00fb territory, and due west from China about 10,000 li. Generally speaking, the country is settled, and the fields cultivated. It produces rice and wheat; the people make use of distilled liquors. Horses are good and plenty, they sweat blood, they are descended from the Ti\u00ean-ma-dsz\u00e8. It has cities with walls, and large and small houses. Its dependent towns are more than seventy in number. The population is about 100,000. The soldiers use the bow and spear, and shoot from horseback. To the north lies Gang-gu; west, the country of the Viddhals \u5927\u6708\u6c0f; southwest, that of the Toch\u00e2ri \u5927\u590f; north-east, W\u00fb-sun \u9ce5\u5b6b; east, Han-mow\u00b2 \u626f\u67d0 and Yu-tien\u00b3 \u5343\u8cc7.\n\nTo the west of Yu-tien all the rivers have a westerly flow to the West Sea \u897f\u6d77; east of it the waters flow easterly to the Salt Marsh \u9e7d\u6fa4. The Salt Marsh flows underground, and communicates in the south with the head waters of the Ho.\u2074 There is much jade stone along the course of the Ho towards China. Lau-lan\u2075 \u6a13\u862d and Gu-sze\u2076 \u59d1\u5e2b have walled cities adjacent to the Salt Marsh. From the Salt\n\n\u00b9 I have been compelled, on a careful consideration of the map of Central Asia, to place most of the localities named in Djang-kien's report considerably eastward of their usually accepted positions. Da-wan has usually been identified with Ferghana, but its position between Gang-gu, Da-hia, the Viddhals, and bounded eastwardly by Khoten and Hanmow, compels me to fix it on the site of the modern Kashgar and Yarkand. I am unable to offer any satisfactory clue to the name.\n\n\u00b2 Hanmow or Hanmi, a state not marked on the maps. It must have lain N.E. of Khoten.\n\n\u00b3 Yu-tien, the present Khoten. A. Remusat was the first to point out the Aryan origin of the name as Koustana, 'the breast of the world;' more correctly, perhaps, Kulstana, 'the apex,' from the root kul, in collis, Greek \u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03c9\u03b2\u03cc\u03c2, Chinese \u9ad8, etc., and stana, 'mamma,' as Kulagiri from Kul and giri 'mountain.'\n\n\u2074 Ho, the Yellow River.\n\n\u2075 Lou-l\u00e2n, apparently the Charchan of Marco Polo; l representing the d or ch. It does not appear on the maps. Vide Yule's Marco Polo, 1st ed. p. 178. In the later Chinese works it appears as Shen shen. Yuen-chwang (Hiouen Thsang), after leaving Khoten, travelled east 300 li to Pimo, thence 200 li to Nijang, then 400 li of desert to Tonholo; from whence 600 li took him to Chemotona in the kingdom of Tsiemo. Thence 1000 li N.E. lay Nafopo belonging to Lau-lan, from which he went on to Shachow. Fah-hian likewise went from Shachow to Khoten by the same tract. Lau-lan and Shen shen, as well as Polo's Charchan, point to the original name as Dardana.\n\n\u2076 Kushi, called also Kiushi by the commentator, apparently stands for Aksu. This is so common in names that identification seems impossible.\nMarsh to Chang-an is about 5000 li. The Hiung-nu live to the right, east of the Salt Marsh. There is a road leading south from Chang-ching in Lung-si to Thibet.\n\nWu sun \u6211\u5b6b lies north-east of Da-wan about 2000 li. Its people are herdsmen and of similar manners to the Hiung-nu. Its bowmen are about 10,000 in number; they are daring and quarrelsome. Formerly they were subject to the Hiung-nu. They are in a prosperous condition. They marry their near relations, and refuse to pay homage at Court.\n\nGang-gu \u5eb7\u5c45 lies to the north-west of Da-wan. It is as large as the country of the Viddhals, and the manners and customs of the people are similar. It can muster 80,000 or 90,000 bowmen. It is not so large as its neighbour Da-wan. On the south it has relations with the Viddhals; on the east with the Hiung-nu.\n\nIm-tai \u5370\u8521 lies to the north-west of Gang-gu some 2000 li; it is as large and its customs are alike. It can muster upwards of 100,000 bowmen. It overlooks the great Shoreless Marsh \u5927\u6fa4\u7121\u5d16, reaching to the Northern Sea.\n\nDa-yue-ti \u5927\u6708\u6c0f (the country of the Great Viddhals) lies west of Da-wan 2000 or 3000 li. The Viddhals dwell north of the Gwei-shui \u6eaa\u6c34. To their south is Da-hia \u5927\u590f (Tocharistan); west, An-sih \u5b89\u606f (Arsac or Parthia); north, Gang-gu. They are herdsmen and nomades, with customs similar to those of the Hiung-nu. They can muster 100,000 to 200,000 bowmen. In former times they were rash, and underrated the power of the Hiung-nu, and\n\n1 Wu sun, the upper valley of the Naryn and possibly Hs\n2 Gang-gu would by analogy represent Kara-kul, but this would pre-suppose the presence of Turkish names on the Pamir before the Christian era, of which I have found no other traces. Sartakol \"the yellow lake,\" it may be true interpretation of the name, would, however, seem to point to a similar antiquity, especially if, as suggested below, we are to identify the Sakarouah of Strabo with the Sarakholes of to-day.\n3 Im-tai, Samarkand. Lower down the name is given more fully as \u5370\u8521\u9ece\u8ed2\n4 Im-tai ar-gan, the first two syllables are probably inverted, so that originally it appeared as Sal-ma-ar-gan.

The Greek writers called them the White Huns, according to Procopius, from their light complexions.\nrejected all accommodation. The Hiung-nu attacked and routed them; the Shen-yu Lao-shang killing their king and making a drinking cup out of his skull.\n\nFormerly the Viddhals dwelt between Dun-hwang and Ki-lin. When they were invaded by the Hiung-nu, they were compelled to emigrate to a distance. They passed Da-wan, invaded Da-hia on the west, and overcame it. Following the course of the D\u016b-gwai-shui, they fixed their royal residence on its north bank.\n\nA smaller portion of the tribe, which was unable to accompany them, sought the protection of the Giangs (Thibetans) of Nan-shan; this branch is known as the Smaller Viddhals.\n\nAn-sik (Arsak) lies west of the Viddhals about 1000 li. The country is open, the land tilled. It produces both rice and wheat. Distilled liquors are used. Its cities are like those of Da-wan; those dependent on it, large and small, are about one hundred in number. The extent of the country is about 1000 li square. It is a very powerful state. It overlooks the Gwai (Oxus). There are marts where the people and merchants meet to buy and sell. Carriages and ships are used for the transport of merchandize to neighbouring countries, perhaps 1000 li off. Silver is used in coins, the coins bear the likeness of their kings. When the king dies, the image is immediately changed for that of the new ruler. They write on skins of parchment, and make books of it.\n\nTo the west of Ansik is Tiaou-chi (Sarangia); north, Im-tsa\u00ef-ar-gan (Samarkand).\n\nTiaou-chi lies to the west of Ansik, about 1000 li. It overlooks the western sea (Persian Gulf or Sea of Oman). It is an agricultural country, producing rice. There are great birds there with eggs like water jars. The inhabitants\n\n---\n\n1 Lao-shang, perhaps Oldar or Ildar.\n2 Now Sha-chow in Kansuh.\n3 The D\u016b-gwai-shui seems to be the Surkh-ab, though that name would more regularly have been represented by the syllables T\u016b-kwai.\n4 An-sik or Ngan-sak. Ngan is the representation of Greek \u1f08\u03c1\u03c3\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2, hence we may assume Arsak as the original pronunciation. The country is probably so called from its line of kings, the Arsacidae.\n5 Tiaou-chi, Sarangia. Tiaou is the analogue of Greek \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2, chi represents the ngia.\nare very numerous. They are continually electing petty sovereigns. In consequence Aneik has taken it under its protection, but treats it as a foreign country. The country is good but disorderly. In Ansik the old men have a story that in Timou-chi is situated a Yok-shui (Dead or Weak Water),\u00b9 the Si Wang-mu\u00b2 and the Wei-tang-gin.\n\nDa-hia\u00b3 \u5927\u590f lies upwards of 2600 li south-west of Dauan, to the south of the Gwai-shui (the Oxus). Generally speaking the country is open. It has cities and dwellings similar to Da-wan. It has no supreme sovereign; each city and town elects its own petty ruler. Its soldiers are weak, and cowards in fight. The people are good as merchants. The Viddhals attacked it from the west, and completely routed it, establishing a sovereignty over it. The population is numerous, probably over a million. Its capital is called Lam-shi-ching.\u2074 There are marts for the purchase and sale of merchandize. To its south-east lies Shin-duh \u8eab\u6bd2 (India). Djang-kien said that when he was in Da-hia he saw Kiung bamboo staves and Sze-ebuen clothes. He asked whence they were obtained. The people of Da-hia said their traders went to the Indian markets. India is distant from Da-hia to the south-east about 1000 li. Generally speaking the country is settled, and resembles Da-hia. Its climate is damp and hot. Its people use elephants in war.\n\nThus far Szema Tsien, whose work of the century immediately preceding the Christian era is the most trustworthy record of these events we possess. We may compare with his account the scanty records handed down in the classical writers.\n\nStrabo (lib. xi.) mentions, but only incidentally, the over-\n\n\u00b9 Yok-shui. The Dead Water (Yok, Greek \u03bd\u03b5\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2, \u03bd\u03b5\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd) here spoken of is evidently the Hamun or lake of Seistan. The original Yok-shui of Chinese legend referred apparently to an ancient lake in Eastern Turkestan, of which lake Lob is now the representative.\n\u00b2 Si Wang-mu. See Mayer's Chinese Reader's Manual, s.v.\n\u00b3 Da-hia, the country of the Tochiri.

The phonetic of Lam points to a root \u03bb\u03ac\u03bc\u03b2\u03c9. Darampsa was probably the original name.\nthrow of the Bactrian power by tribes of Nomades from the north. He says, speaking of those of Central Asia, \"The best known of the Nomades are those who conquered Bactria from the Greeks, the Asii, Pasiani, Toch\u00e2ri, and Sakarauli, etc.\" The works of the later Greek authors are, unfortunately, not accessible in Shanghai, so that I can only quote at secondhand. Trogus Pompeius mentions the Asii and Saranci. If my suggestion that Sakarauli is an error of transcription for Sarakauli, be correct, we may identify these latter with the Saranci of Trogus, and possibly the Sarikoolies of the present day.\n\nBoth Trogus and Justin, according to Colonel Yule,\u00b9 mention the Toch\u00e2ri in a manner which connects them with the fall of the Bactrian kingdom. By the time of Procopius, the Toch\u00e2ri seem for a time to have escaped from memory; hence he speaks of the Ephthalit\u00e6 or White Huns apparently without mentioning the Toch\u00e2ri. The Ephthalit\u00e6 were called white (\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4), from the colour of their bodies, they were not ugly (\u1f00\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03cc\u03c4) in countenance, in this matter agreeing with the Chinese author, who speaks of their pink and white complexions.\n\nThough subjugated by the Ephthalit\u00e6, the Toch\u00e2ri would seem, in some degree, to have maintained their national name. In the Chinese report, we find the Oxus dividing the districts occupied by the two peoples. The Ephthalit\u00e6 were, however, the ruling caste. The Toch\u00e2ri, more numerous, though less energetic, seem, however, to have gradually superseded the newer race, so that in medi\u00e6val times we again find them giving their name to the country of Toch\u00e2ristan.\n\nDjang Kien's account of the occupation of Bactria throws considerable light on one or two points, which have up to this time been matters of difficulty with those who have approached the subject with knowledge drawn only from Western sources, or from information taken, mainly at second-hand, from the later Chinese historians. The conquest of the country by the Toch\u00e2ri and allied tribes was probably\n\n\u00b9 Essay on the Geography of the Valley of the Oxus, prefixed to the new edition of Wood's \"Journey to the Source of the Oxus.\"\ngradual rather than sudden. The disunion of the Greeks, and the want of a strong central government, of which we have evidence in the number of petty sovereigns whose names are to be found on their coins, left the country open to be invaded in detail. The Tochari would seem to have superseded the Greeks in one city after another, and to have in a great measure adopted their ways and customs. Hence the Chinese writer expresses his surprise at the number of petty sovereigns, each city or town constantly setting up its own. The consequence was that the Tochari in turn fell an easy prey to their more warlike and energetic neighbours, the Ephthalite, who had learned, by dire necessity, in their utter defeat by the Hsiung-nu, the need of a strong organization.\n\nThe Greeks themselves were never very numerous. Cut off by the Parthians from free intercourse with the mother kingdom, the purity of their blood was not renewed from time to time, and they in consequence degenerated into the soldiers, weak and cowardly in fight, of whom Djang Kien speaks. When the Ephthalite, therefore, flying from their relentless enemies, the Hsiung-nu, appeared on their frontiers, the rich valley of the Oxus afforded an easy prey. Still, even by them it does not seem to have been at once overcome, but, for a time, a distinction, in name at least, was kept up between the districts occupied by the two peoples.\n\nAPPENDIX.\n\nComparison of the Ancient and Modern Sounds of Chinese.\n\nThere is little reason to doubt that the Djows, when they settled in China, spoke an Aryan dialect, akin in vocabulary at least, if not in inflexion, to Sanskrit. A great proportion, if not the greater number, of words made use of in the old language can be referred to Aryan roots, and as the tendency of the language has been, within historical times, to slough off, as it were, terminus and inflexions, we may imagine how much stronger was that tendency when the empire was still\nin an unsettled state, and the Djows and kindred Aryan tribes were striving, partly by force of arms and partly by alliance with the original inhabitants, to maintain their existence.\n\nSome of these old terminations still survive in the provincial dialects, and some may have lived on within historic times, but have left little or no trace in the modern language. There are, however, two methods by which we can gauge the fact of their existence and, thus, be enabled to make a comparison of the bald monosyllabic akin to that of the Vedas; viz., the study of the ancient geography, and of the ethnology of Central and Eastern Asia, where unlooked-for coincidences spring up on every side.\n\nProbably up to this time the greatest obstacle in the way of the comparison of Chinese and Aryan roots has stood in a false nomenclature. Chinese mutes, unlike those in other languages, have been supposed to be divided into two classes, ordinary mutes and aspirates; and these so-called aspirates, differing in outward appearance from sounds ordinarily found in European languages, have been supposed to mark a totally distinct class of vocables.\n\nIt is only of late years that the true nature of the supposed Chinese aspirate has been pointed out, and shown to be nothing more than an ultra-surd. Thus, if we write in parallel columns the ordinary European pronunciation of the mute sounds as compared with Chinese, we shall have:\n\n| Eng. | Ch. | Eng. | Ch. | Eng. | Ch. | Eng. | Ch. |\n|------|-----|------|-----|------|-----|------|-----|\n| k'   | t'  | p'   | ch' | Ultra-surd |\n| k    | t   | p    | ch  | Medial |\n| g    | d   | b    | j   |\n\nIn other words, the Chinese, in pronouncing their mutes of both classes, cut off the sound more sharply than we should do; a peculiarity which in Europe we may notice\namongst Celtic-speaking races, as the Scotch Highlanders, the Irish, and in a manner the French.\n\nIn transliterating Chinese I have, therefore, dropped the apostrophe usually adopted to mark the ultra-surd, and have substituted for it the ordinary surd of its class, and for the medial have made use of the sonant letter. Compared with Sanskrit and Greek, the surds and sonants will be found in inverted order:\n\nSanskrit k, g, gh, kh t d, dh, th p b, bh, ph.\nChinese g k or h d or df t, ch or sh b p or f.\n\nThe aspirated sounds of Sanskrit being usually found in Chinese as ultra-surds, the language having no true aspirates except f, and partially h.\n\nBesides the simple consonants, Chinese has a class of sounds which we may represent in English by ch, dj; ts, dz; and sh. These usually are interchangeable in each class, and represent for the most part the sounds of d and t in Sanskrit, confounding, however, with the former Sanskrit s, and frequently g; the latter of which more regularly behaves as k.\n\nThe sounds for ch and j in Sanskrit are found to vary much in Chinese, though they are generally represented by the corresponding gutturals, according to the rule above of the interchange of surd and sonant.\n\nCerebral sounds perhaps once existed; they are not now to be found.\n\nLike j or ch, Sanskrit v varies much in passing into Chinese; it is found as y, w, f, u, w.\n\nR often gives place to r; sometimes it survives as ng.\n\nM, e, and n usually preserve their original form.\n\nSo much for initial consonants.\n\nThe Cantonese and a few other dialects preserve as finals m, k, t, and p. All distinction of surd, sonant, and aspirate has been lost.\n\nR final usually appears as ng, but sometimes follows the rule for e.\n\nL final seems to have remained in the spoken language for a long period. Its echoes have scarcely yet died out, and\nmay be detected by an English ear in the common final _ow_; as _daou te-laim_, _paou pu-lam_. Frequently it is only indicated by the lengthening of the vowel, as _di_ or _dai_, Sanskrit _tala_, _fundus_, etc.\n\nThus we have, according to the orthography adopted:\n\n| Chinese | Sanskrit or Greek | Chinese | Sanskrit or Greek |\n|---------|------------------|---------|------------------|\n| \u8001\u5b50     | kar              | \u6c5f\u5357     | dri              |\n| \u77e5       | giri             | \u6d1b\u9633     | dul              |\n| \u516c\u4e3b     | giri-ma          | \u5510\u671d     | jaceru           |\n| \u5927\u4eba     | tan              | \u5357\u671d     | oschip           |\n| \u592a\u5e73     | ding             | \u968b\u671d     | caput            |\n| \u5927\u4e8b     | pri              | \u65b0\u671d     | tegere           |\n| \u5927\u4e8b     | pri              | \u65b0\u671d     | arceru           |\n| \u5927\u4e8b     | pri              | \u65b0\u671d     | mel              |\n| \u5927\u4e8b     | pri              | \u65b0\u671d     | lavare           |\n| \u5927\u4e8b     | pri              | \u65b0\u671d     | ungantum         |\n| \u5927\u4e8b     | pri              | \u65b0\u671d     | ar-are           |\n| \u5927\u4e8b     | pri              | \u65b0\u671d     | Aryam men        |\n\nThe above illustrations are only taken at random, from among hundreds of others, to illustrate the more usual permutations. The laws of change will, however, be found to be constant; and, with the aid of this table, any one conversant with the rule known as Grimm's law, and possessing an adequate knowledge of Chinese and of the principal Aryan languages, can easily for himself trace out the further inter-dependence of the two.\n\nI have not space to enter into vowel-sounds, nor into the question of tones; nor, again, of possible lost inflexions. For the purpose of the preceding paper, and to show the possibility, to a greater extent than has been hitherto done, of utilising the Chinese authors for the illustration of the ancient names of localities, I trust the above examples will be sufficient.\n\nIt is to be understood that in transliterating foreign names, the above system did not prevail beyond the time of the early Hans. By the time of Yuen chwang (Hiouen Thsang) the pronunciation of Chinese had come in a great measure to approach the modern speech. In the Yuen dynasty we may find the modern system of alliteration fully adopted.\nJOURNAL\nOF\nTHE ROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY\n\nART. XV.\u2014On the Hill Canton of Salar\u2014the most Easterly Settlement of the Turk Race. By Robert B. Shaw.\n\nAlthough the Chinese are now rolling back the tide of Musulm\u00e1n rebellion which had invaded their North-Western Provinces (exercising frightful barbarities on the towns they have successively retaken), yet some interest still attaches to the little Hill Canton of Salar, which appears to have formed the nucleus of the rebellion and the chief stronghold of Islam in Western China. Dim rumours of its existence had reached Europe, but it had been supposed to be one of the towns of the Tunganis, or Chinese Musulmans, who were then in insurrection against the Imperial Government. Col. Prschewalsky, the Russian traveller, who passed through Western China during the last throes of the rebellion, just mentions Salar, which, however, he did not visit. I was able to learn something about the district and its inhabitants from some Salar men who were living in Yarkand during my last stay there, and it seems to be a curious country with a curious people.\n\nTo begin with the latter, the Salars form the most easterly settlement of the Turk race of which we have any knowledge. Isolated among Chinese and Mongolians, they have a tradition that their ancestors came from Rum or Turkey. The story is as follows. Their spiritual guide or religious teacher, some 700 years ago, sent them forth on a pilgrimage, giving them a sample of earth, with instructions to wander until they\nshould reach some country whose soil should weigh the same, measure for measure, as the sample which they bore with them. From land to land they roamed, weighing the earth from place to place, till they came by way of Tibet to S\u00e1l\u00e1r-n\u00e9s (Lower S\u00e1l\u00e1r). Here the earth was found to come nearer in weight to their sample than it had been anywhere else. Still it differed somewhat. They were preparing to march further when it was discovered that some of their camels, laden with religious books, had strayed. In search of them they penetrated into the hill country which lay at the side of their road. Here their task received its accomplishment. They weighed the soil and found it exactly balanced an equal measure of that which had been given to them by their spiritual teacher. Here, therefore, they rested from their travel, and finding the hills uninhabited, they formed a settlement, to which they gave the name of S\u00e1l\u00e1r-g\u00e9s or Upper S\u00e1l\u00e1r, though to what language the affix belongs I do not know.\n\nWhatever may be their real history, they are a people of Turki race from their appearance, and speak a language differing but slightly from the Turki of K\u00e1shghar. They have but little hair on their faces, but are ruddy and comparatively fair in countenance, differing much in this respect from the yellow-skinned Mongol K\u00e1lm\u00e1ks and from the Chinese. It is true I only saw two or three of their number, but this is the judgment which I formed from them.\n\nThe climate of their country differs from its surroundings as much as the people. As the latter are a Turki tribe alone amongst Mongolians and Chinese, so the district inhabited by them forms part of a moist Alpine region covered with forest, projecting out into the midst of the most barren wildernesses in the world. With the great desert of Mongolia on the North stretching far up to Siberia, and the equally rainless but elevated region of Tibet on the South-West, the district we are treating of forms the completest contrast. It is here that the great Hoang-Ho or Yellow River, coming from its sources in Tibet, enters China through a vast portal of mountains which, leaving on one side the\nupper course of the river, stretch out their parallel ranges to the Westward; as one may sometimes see, in the approach to some old hall, the grand avenue deserted and grassgrown, and the road curving round from outside it come in between the trees. So also the Yellow River enters sideways from the South-West, while the great plain between the mountain ranges extends westward, covered with rich grazing grounds, and occupied in part by the great Lake of Koko-N\u00f6r, the so-called Blue Sea of the Chinese and Mongols.\n\nJust within the portal, where the river runs in a deep valley between its mountain walls, high up on the right or southern bank, is the district of S\u00e1l\u00e1r. It is watered by mountain streams, from which canals are diverted for irrigation, although the cultivation chiefly depends upon the periodical rains. The S\u00e1l\u00e1ris reckon their rainy season to last for six months, viz. from June to November inclusive, during part of which time the rain is intermittent, being broken by intervals of fine weather. The rainfall is said to be very severe and heavy, so as to be injurious to the fields and crops, though, owing to the declivities, the soil dries up at once on its ceasing. On the skirts of the mountains, however, where there is no irrigation available, and where probably the rain is less heavy, it is of great benefit to the crops which thus depend on it.\n\nThere are heavy falls of snow in December, January and February, which melts away in March from the neighbourhood of the villages, but remains on the tops of the mountains till April, after which no snow is visible excepting on the mountains north of the river, in the district of Suining, on which the snow remains throughout the year. Thus about S\u00e1l\u00e1r the southern range would seem to have sunk to the level of some eight or ten thousand feet above the sea.\n\nThe temperature of S\u00e1l\u00e1r is said to be about the same in winter as that of Yarkand, while the summers are somewhat cooler. Its productions will give an idea of the climate. The crops chiefly grown are wheat, barley, peas, millet, linseed, etc. There is no Indian-corn grown (or very little) nor rice. The latter is imported from the low countries. Wheat and\nbarley are sown in April and reaped in August. By October, everything is out of the ground. The principal trees are poplar, willow, elm, walnut, apple, pear, apricot and peach. The mountains above S\u00e1l\u00e1r are covered with forests of fir-trees; at least so I understand from the description of my informant (there being no word in Turki for the *fir* genus). He describes the trees as being straight and tall, with leaves rough, thin and wiry, which are always green throughout the year. The people of the mountains take these trees by means of the river down to the lower countries, where they are used for building purposes. When they cut this tree, a pleasant smell comes from it.\n\nOne might perhaps be inclined to feel doubts regarding the existence of such a forest region, with periodical rains, in the midst of a part of Asia noted for its rainless character and barrenness, if Col. Prschewalsky, the Russian traveller who lately visited the Koko-N\u00f3r (Lake) to the west of it, had not recorded this phenomenon with regard to the mountainous tract on the north of the Yellow River in Western Kansuh, which is a part of the same region. It is possible that the rain-clouds from the China Seas are here led along to the westward by the mountain chains running in that direction into the desert, and precipitated in rain on their flanks by the cold atmosphere of the highlands, while the heated air rising from the plains in summer (the season of the rains) opposes an obstacle to this precipitation over the tracts to the northward, and the vast belt of mountains which surrounds Tibet acts as a protection in that quarter. The name of the desert of Mongolia, *Gobi*, i.e. the Empty, shows sufficiently its character.\n\nIt would seem that, before the rebellion, the Chinese administration of the district of S\u00e1l\u00e1r was similar to that of their other foreign possessions; that is, was left entirely in the hands of native chiefs as to details, while a general supervision was exercised by an Amb\u00e1n or Resident supported by troops. Under him were two native Musulm\u00e1n chiefs ruling the two divisions of the canton. The title of the one was Kh\u00e1nt\u00fas and of the other M\u00e1lt\u00fas, and, on the death of the\nincumbent, the dignity was handed on to some member of his family or to some other native Musulm\u00e1n. In the trial of cases, the K\u00e1z\u00eds, or religious magistrates, sat as assessors with these native Governors, who alone had the power of inflicting punishment. The chief crimes of the country seem to have been caused by village quarrels followed by vendetta, as among the Afghans. Many lives are thus lost, for which, if the injured side could not obtain revenge in kind, they appealed to the native Governors or even finally to the Chinese Amb\u00e1n. These endeavoured to make up the quarrels by soft words or by adjudging a money compensation to the aggrieved party, failing which, life for life was taken. It was only on such occasions, or when specially appealed to, that the Chinese Resident interfered in the administration of the canton. This seems to have been universally the character of Chinese rule over foreign dependencies. Both in Tibet and in the formerly dependent provinces of Eastern Turkestan and Zungaria, the internal government was left entirely in the hands of natives, who were supported, even in misrule, by the power of the Chinese arms.\n\nThe taxation of S\u00e1l\u00e1r was very light. Each petty landholder paid a charak (about 16 lbs.) of grain yearly. This grain was consumed by the Government troops on the spot, and no other taxes were imposed on the natives.\n\nI speak in the past tense because my information refers to the state of affairs before the late rebellion, of which S\u00e1l\u00e1r was one of the head-quarters, though it embraced also the large Muhammadan Chinese population of the neighbouring provinces. Regarding the present state of affairs I have no exact information; for, though it is known that the active rebellion has been stamped out by massacres of whole towns and by the migration westward of large numbers of Tung\u00fas or Chinese Musulm\u00e1ns, yet it is not ascertained that even up to this day the Imperial army has succeeded in storming the mountain fastnesses of S\u00e1l\u00e1r or subjecting its inhabitants to Chinese rule again.\n\nTheir numbers are said to be about 40,000, and they live in villages consisting of scattered farmhouses each on its own\nland. Groups of four or five villages each are administered by local chiefs called \"Im\u00e1k,\" who again are subordinate to the two Governors, above mentioned, respectively. The Chinese call the canton S\u00e1-Ho\u00edza and its people S\u00e1l\u00e1-Ho\u00edza. The second word of the two compounds seems to be that applied by the Chinese to Muhammadans generally, which is stated to be \"Hoei-Hoei\" or \"Hoei-ze.\" The S\u00e1l\u00e1ris know themselves as Mumin or \"the Faithful,\" an Arabic word.\n\nSuch are the people who formed one of the nuclei of the great Musulm\u00e1n rebellion. I will now say a few words regarding their local position in relation to the other tribes of that region. Locally they are situated in the Chinese North-Western Province of Kansuh, which, during the former period of extension of the Chinese rule, is stated by my informants to have comprised within its jurisdiction all the foreign dependencies in the west as far as K\u00e1shghar and Y\u00e1rkand. For this purpose the Province was divided into two parts, one inside the Great Wall of China, viz. Kansuh proper, the other beyond the Wall, where all the inhabitants were considered outer barbarians.\n\nThe city of Lan-chu, the capital of this great province, lies some distance to the East of S\u00e1l\u00e1r. Between the two lies the Chinese town of Ho-chau (pronounced by my informant Kho-du or Kho-chu).\u00b9 This town has sometimes been identified with S\u00e1l\u00e1r, and in point of position they are in fact very near to one another. If from the city of Lan-chu, as a centre, two radii be drawn, one westward and the other north-westward, these will roughly represent, one, the upper course of the Yellow River (on whose south bank is S\u00e1l\u00e1r); the other, the great western road which connects China with the provinces of Turkist\u00e1n. At a certain distance along this road it is crossed by the celebrated Great Wall (called Wan-li Ch\u00fcan (Chang) Chin (Chang) or \"the Wall of Ten-thousand li\"), as by the circumference of a great wheel. The road goes through the Wall by a guarded gateway called in the local Chinese dialect J\u00e4yi-Gwan (Kia y\u00fc kwan). All the\n\n\u00b9 The name of the Yellow River, or Hoang-ho, is pronounced by him Khwang-kho, and Pekin B\u00e9jin.\nregion outside this Gate, as far as the Altai Mountains, the Pamir and the back of the Himalaya Mountains, is called by the Chinese Sh\u00e9-k'hoi (Si-kou-wei), which is said to mean \"Western (region) outside of mouth,\" by mouth meaning the gateway above mentioned, and is divided by them into a northern and a southern circuit (P\u00e9-lu and N\u00e1n-lu).\n\nInside the triangle formed by the Great Wall, the western road, and the Yellow River, lay the chief scene of the Musulm\u00e1n rebellion, though the rebels carried their ravages at times into other regions. They have since been put down with the utmost severity, and the massacre of 30,000 Musulm\u00e1ns, men, women and children, at Suchau, near the Great Gate, and of large numbers in other towns, recall the barbarities of Chingiz Khan. All the associations of these places, however, are not those of blood and massacre, for Sining, a town nearly opposite S\u00e1l\u00e1r on the north of the Yellow River, has always enjoyed a considerable commercial celebrity. Under the name of Seling or Zelin, it is well known in the markets of Western Tibet, and my informant gave me a detailed list of the trade carried on through it.\n\nSining seems to be the entrep\u00f4t of trade between Mongolia and China on the north-east and the various tribes of Tibet on the south-west. A considerable trade is carried on with Lh\u00e1sa, the capital of the Grand Lama of Tibet, by means of official or Government caravans (as is also the case between Lh\u00e1sa and Lad\u00e1k), and traders from Kashmir, even, come via Lh\u00e1sa to Sining and reside there. The nearer neighbours of Sining and S\u00e1l\u00e1r, occupying the country north of Tibet, are various partly independent tribes, among whom my informant mentioned the Kirghiz, though their presence so far to the south-east is very doubtful.\n\nOne of the other tribes, named D\u00e1s\u00e1 (Ta-tze), seem to be Mongols, probably forming the most southerly extension of that race. They are nomads and Buddhist by religion, and wear long pig-tails.\n\nThe next race is called Si-fan. They are pastoral nomads and robbers, which two professions often go together. They are called by the local Chinese Chuan Rung or \"Dog-men.\"\nThese are the people whom Col. Prschewalsky calls Tangutans (on what local authority does not appear). From the specimens of their language recorded by him, as well as those given by my informant, it would seem that they belong to the Tibetan race. He conversed in my presence in the Si-fan tongue with a Tibetan of Lad\u00e1k, who understood him, though with some difficulty.\n\nMy informant mentioned three other tribes who speak the same language and are therefore Tibetans, and who are settled people living by agriculture. One of them, called Khun-mo, practise polyandry, and wear their hair long but cut across the forehead, while the other two, named respectively Kopa and Turun, wear pig-tails. These latter are subject to the authority of the Dalai L\u00e1ma, and carry us up to the borders of Lh\u00e1sa or Great Tibet.\n\nThe trade of all these people and of the countries beyond them concentrates at Sining, whence it is dispersed again. From Tibet come annual caravans, sent by the Grand L\u00e1ma, which take about two months on the journey. Almost all the trade between the two places is carried on by these trade-agents of the L\u00e1ma. It is not usual for Sining merchants to go to Tibet, as this would be at variance with the system of the L\u00e1ma Government in its intercourse with the West. Save the official agents, few people engage in the trade between Lh\u00e1sa and Lad\u00e1k; whether it be that they are discouraged from doing so except in a few favoured instances, or else that the length and costliness of the journey make it hard for private individuals to compete with the Government caravans from both sides which obtain their carriage free. This matter is settled by treaty as well as by old custom; and the Maharaja of Kashmir, our feudatory, as successor to the rights of the old Kings of Lad\u00e1k, is entitled to send a caravan every third year to Lh\u00e1sa, the goods being transported by unpaid labour, in return for similar privileges conferred on the yearly Lh\u00e1sa caravan.\n\nTo return to Sining, the relations between the townspeople and their nomad neighbours, the Si-fan, present an example of what has been called \"dumb-trading,\" but which\nmight more correctly be styled \"blind-bargaining.\" The Si-fans bring the goods they have for sale, chiefly skins and furs of animals, done up in sacks, of which they do not exhibit the contents till a bargain is struck. The townspersons go out to meet them, and show them what they will give in exchange. If this is considered sufficient, the exchange is effected; but if not, the Si-fans hold off till more is offered by the same or by another trader. It is only when he has given up his own goods that the purchaser is able to see what it is that he has bought.\n\nIt is said to be impossible for the Sining people to go into the Si-fan country to trade, as the nomads would plunder them as soon as they set foot in it. The only people with whom the latter are on terms of reciprocal friendship are the Musulmans of Salar, first described, and who are the only merchants who can visit the Si-fans in their own tents. This friendship has perhaps given rise to Col. Prschewalsky's apparent identification of the two people in the nomenclature which he applies to them. The Si-fan nomads he calls Tangutans, and the Salaris Black Tangutans. But, as from their language it would appear that the former are Tibetans, and the latter Turks, there must be some mistake in this.\n\nFrom the Ladak side we obtain information regarding these regions from another aspect. The Lhasa merchants state that their traders go to the Chinese town of Sining, which they call Selung or Zilin (thus confirming the identification suggested by Col. Yule). The caravans, they say, are accompanied by a guard to protect them en route from the attacks of the Sok-po nomads. These must be the same as the Si-fans or Tangutans of Col. Prschewalsky. Besides these there are said to be other Sok-po of the tribes called Kalka and Torgud. These names are well known as those of Mongol tribes, and therefore the name Sok-po is shown not to be an ethnic distinction. The invasion of Tibet by Galdan Tsining, King of the Zungar Kalmyks (Mongo-\n\n---\n\nMy lamented friend, Col. T. G. Montgomery, pointed out the identity of Selung or Jiling (as Pundit Nain Singh called it) with Sinung-fu, in his Report on Trans-Himalayan explorations during 1858.\u2014H. Y.\nlians), is ascribed to the Sok-po in the Tibetan annals of the Kings of Lad\u00e1k in my possession.\n\nWhile considering the tribes which occupy the Eastern part of the great unknown land that stretches along the north of Tibet, it is not perhaps out of place to give a few items of information regarding its more Western tracts, which I obtained from some Lad\u00e1ki Tibetans who go on trading expeditions each year.\n\nFrom the gold-producing district of Thok-Jalung north of the Upper Indus, now well known through the labours of Col. Montgomerie's Pandits, my informants state that they travel northwards for four days of fast travelling to get to a place called Jing-Chen Jing-Chun, where a tribe of so-called Kergi\u00e9s live in fifty or sixty tents, under their chief, Skarma-Angdu. The name of the tribe is interesting in connexion with the statement mentioned above of the Kirghis being one of the tribes haunting the deserts west of Sining. These Ker-gi\u00e9s, however, are Buddhists. They own many sheep (of the Tibetan breed) and yaks; they dress like the Lh\u00e1sa people, and wear their hair loose but cut across the forehead, as was mentioned by my S\u00e1l\u00e1ri informants in the case of the Khun-mo tribe. The women wear their hair also loose, with rough turquoises in it, and my informants imitated the motion with which they continually toss their heads to shake the hair aside from their faces. These people are robbers of travellers, excepting such as make arrangements for protection with their chief. They pay a small tribute to the district Governor of Gartok, as rent for the pastures which they occupy. In winter they migrate further to the north. In their summer quarters there is a salt lake with no outlet, fed by streams of sweet water.\n\nFrom this tribe's summer quarters a two or three days' journey north by east leads to Kirth\u00e9, the abode of a tribe more barbarous than the Kergi\u00e9s. Each man wears two swords and carries a lance and a gun. They are very murderous. No traders go to them without first obtaining security and a pass from their Chief, Makhpon N\u00e1mgyal. They number some 200 tents.\nIn another direction to the north of the Kergi\u00e9s, but slightly more to the westward than the last, three days' fast riding takes one to Hordum, where are some thirty tents. Here there are better people under a chief named Hor-pal\u00e9. They dress like Yarkandis and own dumba sheep (the broad-tailed kind bred in Turkist\u00e1n). They wear no pig-tails, but their hair is cut across the forehead. Their northernmost grazing grounds adjoin those of the people of Khoten in Eastern Turkist\u00e1n. To these more northern grounds they go in winter, and find them warmer than their southern haunts. This would indicate that they must be beyond the axis of greatest elevation, and that the ground gets lower to the northward. Their summer quarters are on the high plateau, for they have lakes without outlets fed by streams of fresh water. They pay tribute to no one. They profess to be Buddhists, but they have no lamas and their religion is very doubtful. They eat no vegetable food, being unable to obtain any, and they feed their horses in winter on meat. This is a custom mentioned by Mirza Ha\u00efdar in the sixteenth century as prevailing in Tibet generally. Their horses are large compared with the ponies of Tibet, and very active. They gallop up and down the steepest mountain sides, and are reported to attack travellers by charging down on them from all sides at a given signal, with lances couched, and with these they are said to lift and carry off the property of their victims without alighting, if no resistance is offered. If the travellers show fight, they are overpowered, tied up hands and feet, and left thus in the desert. All these tribes are said to talk the Tibetan language but with slight differences.\n\nThe Tibetan traders only visit them in their summer or more southern quarters. They are said to be sometimes attacked themselves by the Chokchu Kaba, a more powerful tribe living further north but regarding whom I could obtain no information.\n\n1 The Kirghiz of Saryu gave me the name \"Kordam K\u00e1k\" as that of the district where the Yarkand River loses itself. Can there be any connexion between this name and \"Hordum,\" here above?\n\n2 K\u00f6pa is the name of a gold-field east of Khoten.\nIt is a curious circumstance, showing the insecurity of the country beyond the borders of Lad\u00e1k, that the traders who go thence to the T\u2019hok-Jalung gold-fields and beyond, leave any ponies they may have, at the last Lad\u00e1k village, and proceed with the hardy donkeys of the country only. This they do in order to avoid tempting the robbers (who are known under the general name of Chak-pa). These people would steal their horses, but donkeys are not sufficiently swift to enable them to go off rapidly, and they will not be troubled to rob the traders of their goods unless they can at the same time supply themselves with beasts to carry them away on.\n\nIn conclusion, I may mention that I have compared the specimens of the so-called Sok-po language of Northern Tibet, by Mr. Brian Hodgson, with the list of K\u00e1lm\u00e1k words, given by Dr. Bellew in the Report of the Mission to Yarkand under Sir T. D. Forsyth, K.C.S.I. Allowing for the slight differences in the way in which different inquirers catch the sounds of an unknown dialect, and represent it in Roman characters, and also for the probability of the same thing having more than one word to express it, the general agreement is, I think, quite sufficient to show that they are both the same language. This confirms the identification of the Sok-po (proper) of Tibetan informants, with the K\u00e1lm\u00e1ks of Musulm\u00e1n (Turk) writers. But the former term seems to be extended, as mentioned above, to the Si-fan nomads, who are Tibetans by language. Probably the term is used, like that of Scythian by classical writers, to include many nomad tribes of different races.\nART. XVI.\u2014Geological Notes on the River Indus. By Griffin W. Vyse, B.A., M.R.A.S., etc., Executive Engineer, P.W.D., Panjab.\n\nOf all the treacherous streams in the world, perhaps none can surpass the River Indus. Its extraordinary changes, mutations, and wanderings, are proverbial, and the terror of all who live on its banks, as life and property are never safe, particularly when the river is in flood, when it seems to run rampant, and is altogether uncontrollable in its onward rush. Nowhere is it more erratic in its mutations than in the section I intend to deal with here.\n\nIt has, from the earliest of times in which we have any record of its eccentric changes, defied alike all the native and British engineering skill at hand, to keep it within its restricted channels. From a short distance below the range of mountains of Kohistan, where it receives the additional waters of Kabul and Gomal, and, further south, the hill torrents on the east side of the great Suleiman Range, on our Belooch frontier, it passes through a low flatish country; its fall along this section of its course varying from five feet per mile, higher up, to about one foot per mile at its junction of the Punjab\u2014or united streams of the Punjab rivers. Along this reach it is intercepted here and there by belts of high impenetrable jungle, broken occasionally by rich fertile tracts, which it, again, leaves for barren sandy deserts and uncultivated waste lands.\n\nFor half the year it is, above the Punjab, a comparatively small stream, with a minimum discharge of 20,000 cubic feet per second, but, during the fierce heat of the Punjab hot weather, it swells into a river of enormous magnitude, overflowing its banks and inundating miles of the surrounding country, through which it passes. It varies its discharge from 20,000 cubic feet per second to the almost incalculable volume of 500,000 cubic feet per second at the height of its flood. This enormous swelling is not so much due to the\nrainfall, as the area of its catchment-basin lies almost wholly beyond the influence of the monsoon or equinoctial current, as to the melting of the snows of the far-off Himalayas during the summer months\u2014a fact clearly shown by the discolouration of its waters. The fine impalpable mud held in suspension which is brought down by the River Indus deposits itself, on the velocity decreasing to 1\u00b785 feet per second. The substance of this silt is generally composed of minute particles of clay, slate, and sand, charged with a vast amount of decayed vegetable matter, of micaceous, talcose, and chloritic schists, and of the aggregation of water-worn particles derived from pre-existing rocks, from the lofty ranges to the North; occasionally gold grains, chloritic, and argillaceous slates in minute particles, quartzitic compounds, gneiss-rock, granitoid schists and other mineral substances are also to be observed.\n\nAfter the first freshet, a large proportion of Sirkandar grass seed is brought down\u2014a grass which grows fifteen feet in height, possesses extraordinary powers of vitality, and from its nature will grow anywhere. Thus, it is a most useful servant, but a bad master. The final flood of the season brings down a vast quantity of lei and tolah seed, and d\u00e9bris mingled with the silt. This deposit of silt forms the richest possible manure, and, if it were not for the covering the lands thus receive, after the season\u2019s floods have subsided, the rabbi (or winter) crops would be poor indeed. I have made certain experiments in order to find the turbidity of the water, at certain seasons and months of the year, when the changes are most marked, and the proportion of silt to water in running currents of the Indus, with the following result:\n\n| Months observed | Water being 1\u00b70 | Velocity of current | Remarks | Wind, etc. |\n|-----------------|----------------|---------------------|---------|-----------|\n| Cold weather (Nov. to February), minimum clearness | 0\u00b703 | 4\u00b722 per sec. | Taken in Mid-channel | Weather calm |\n| March (first freshet) | 0\u00b707 | 5\u00b717 | \" | \" | Light wind |\n| April | 0\u00b708 | 5\u00b739 | \" | \" | Wind South |\n| May | 0\u00b711 | 7\u00b788 | \" | Side channel | \" |\n| June and July, maximum turbidity | 0\u00b716 | 10\u00b735 | \" | \" | \" |\nThere is no single reach of the main stream which is straight for a thousand feet. That is to say, if its banks do not curve and twist every three or four hundred feet, its stream will rebound from left bank to right in the most persistent manner possible; and it follows this law for many hundreds of miles through Sind. What is very noteworthy, when the river is thus acting, is the variable way in which it discards the silt on the side on which it regurgitates; erosion and retrogression of level going on where it impinges.\n\nThe low valleys and dips along the Belooch Hills are undoubtedly due to the erosive action of the Indus, which at some time or other has been here; for whatever inequalities of surface may have originally directed the waters into their channels, all the subsequent deepening, scooping out, and widening, of ravines and glens, or filling up the same, have been owing to the erosive action of running water, laden with sand, gravel, silt, and other triturating debris. This opinion I have formed after careful study, and from observations made along the catchment-basin of the Indus flanking the Belooch hills, and the same idea has been borne out by the testimony of some of the most reliable authorities. The substratum of the vast sandy tracts and boundless arid plains in the Rajanpur vicinity, and again of that great waste beyond Dera-Ghazi-Khan, in the direction of Harrund to Dera-Ismail-Khan, all tend to prove this theory. The borings which have at various times been made along this reach are almost identical, and the different layers of deposit year after year, or flood after flood, are clearly distinguishable. Some of the Lagari chiefs have carried their wells down 60 and 70 feet near the Belooch Hills, and the various strata through which these wells pass are precisely the same: (i) the depth of the surface covering, (ii) the layer of sand, (iii) the seam of fine clay, then (iv) a stratum of coarser sand, below which is (v) a band of clay, which, on exposure to the atmosphere, becomes as hard as earthenware, and makes most excellent pottery. The State Railway Engineers have carried their wells down 107 feet below the lowest part of the existing bed, at a site about 90 miles, as the crow flies, to the nearest point\nof the Belooch Hills. At 68 feet below the bed, they came across branches of trees and logs of wood, of the Himalayan pine; at 75 feet boulders of huge dimensions, and pieces of quartz, granite, etc. At 82 feet the formation was entirely different, and from the minute organic remains which were met with at this depth the scour could never have reached this point.\n\nThe bays so common along the soft shores of the Indus are due to the action of whirlpools, which eat terribly into banks, scour the bed, and change the course of the river far more than the high floods. Where the river impinges, and the channel is at all confined, the danger is considerably increased, particularly where the banks are baked, and broken up in sections, and caked from the fierce heat; when great masses fall over, with a loud report, into the river. Whirlpools are caused by retrogression of level, backward or underground flow, cross or double currents meeting sometimes by a sharp spur jutting out into the stream, and bringing about an increased velocity at the point of contact with the main stream. The sand along some of the worst reaches of the Indus, is of a very friable nature, but in certain sections of the higher sand embankments, on the Sher\u016b and Mozuffergurh Ghat side for instance, where the whirlpools were continually showing themselves, and where the erosion had been most actively at work, the accumulated deposit of last year, where it was some feet in depth, was unlike the other sand of the opposite shore, being firm, hard, and compact. Each freshet or flood seemed to have brought down an entirely different stratum of deposit; here and there were intercepted veins of clay, varying in depth, colour and solidity, not always lying parallel, but twisting, curving, and bending, occasionally showing sharp dips and angles from the other lines, but all finally meeting towards a centre. I attribute such formation to the action of whirlpools which have gradually spent themselves out.\n\nThe observations which have been made by certain engineers have finally established, in the best-authenticated manner, facts which prove that the bed of the Indus (like many other\nof the Punjab rivers) is undergoing great changes; that it is becoming higher in the Punjab, and falling or scouring out lower down in the Sind country and towards its junction with the sea. Viviani, the well-known hydraulic engineer, says, in speaking of the elevation of beds of rivers: \"But the bottom of the new river, being composed of fresh and tenacious earth, can never be perceptibly subverted by the impetuosity of the waters, which in high floods will flow over it in parallel directions;\" and, hence, there would remain no hope that, by means of a great fall, the coarse sands, thrown into the new bed by the tributaries, might be more readily triturated and detached from the bottom, thus causing great obstruction of the canals and irrigation cuts of the country, and to the constantly increasing risk of the embankments.\n\nManfredi lays down as a proposition, \"That the greater the ordinary body of water in a river, the less will be the slope of its bed;\" and Guglielmini has left us the following more precise rules: \"The greater the 'quantity' of water that a river carries, the less will be its fall; and the greater the force (or velocity) of the stream, the less will be the slope of the bed.\" The second rule must be resolved as follows: The greater the velocity of the stream, the less will be the declivity of the bed. These rules, then, will finally resolve themselves into this single one, namely: That the slope of the bottom of the Indus will diminish in the same proportion in which the body of water is increased.\n\nOne may venture, then, to assert, that the bottom of the recipient will be equally established, above and below its junction (i.e. point of rise and fall, or change now going on), if the sines of the slopes are reciprocally in proportion to the volume of its discharge. It is evident that this scouring out and retrogression of level is not confined to any local section, but actively at work from the point of such junction. Zanotti, Manfredi, and lastly M. de la Condamine, have each repeated this doctrine, \"So long as rivers could of themselves keep their mouths open on a flat shore, the regurgitations of the tides would prevent any shoals from forming in the trunk lying above the mouth.\"\nFrisi demands two conditions to insure such an issue: \"A superabundant fall, and a considerable elevation in the general level of the country,\"\u2014conditions not to be obtained in Sind, and therefore not possible for the lower reach of the Indus. It appears, however, that the whole may be reduced to the following principles, which are in themselves simple and clear. If a river having a permanent bed flows alone over a given slope; and if, after the junction of a sudden change, the bottom of the common bed is found to be composed of substances equally removable; its bed may remain equally excavated, even with a less slope than it had before, when the force which the stream employs to tear up the bottom, added to the force with which the matter torn up runs on the inclined gradient, forms, before and after the junction, an equal sum. Now, as the relative gravity, which determines the particles of the bottom to descend, is in proportion to the sine of the inclination of the plane; and as this gravity is very little different in two planes whose inclination is nearly equal (whenever the question is of inclination at such a point as near the sea it is so small, the relative force of gravity may be neglected); therefore, in lessening the sine of the slope, on which the bottom of the solitary recipient is established, in proportion to the bulk or volume of water by which it is increased, there would be obtained a slope greater than is necessary for the body of the discharge. Cutting away and demolition of the shore at the mouth is ever going on, and the millions and millions of cubic feet of silt and d\u00e9bris brought down by the river when in flood is forming additions to the bottom where its force ends, and that the accumulations being washed back by the tide, clear of the thread of the stream, have no fixed place, until borne beyond the influence of such action, they sink to a deeper bottom. Retrogression of level here is but local, and cannot affect the bed higher up in its trunk; still less, the level of the water when once it falls. A glance at the map of the Punjab will show the tendency of the five rivers, after leaving the Himalayas, to follow a south-westerly course, and how they are all drawn towards the Indus. From the numerous dry\nchannels and beds of old abandoned rivers, to be found in the Montgomery, Mooltan, Mozaffergurh, and Bhawalpur districts, there cannot be the smallest doubt that their courses were once more southerly and of greater length than they are at present, and joined the Indus many miles lower down. That they are still obeying this law cannot be doubted; an evident indication that it is the wish of Nature to send them to a junction yet higher up, which points to some spot about one hundred miles to the north of Mooltan, where they may all unite. The Punjnad is eating its way gradually up the Indus, and must, in time, reach Dera Ghazi Khan, where possibly the slope of the country, the play, reach, and discharge, will resist its united waters from pursuing a higher point.\n\nIt has been clearly proved that the Narra, or Hakra, was not the old bed of the Indus. The course of the lost river may be traced from the Himalayas to the sea. Evidence has been adduced to show that the Hakra did not dry up in consequence of any diminution of rainfall or failure of its course; but that its waters, having ceased to flow in their ancient bed, still find their way by another channel to the ocean. It has been demonstrated that the missing river was not the Indus nor the Gaggar, nor the sacred Saraswati, nor yet a mythic stream; but was no other than the well-known Sutlaj. The Dhora Pur\u00e1n may be traced, under different names, from above Halla to the Rann of Kach. There can be no doubt that, as observed by Pottinger (see Journal Royal Asiatic Society), this was the eastern branch of the Indus, down which Alexander the Great sailed to the great lake and to the sea. This also was evidently the eastern or greater arm of the Mikran, described by Rashid-ud-deen as branching off from above Mansura to the east, to the borders of Kach, and known by the name of Sindh Sagara (Elliot, vol. i. p. 49). This ancient river bed is also identical with the Sankra Nala, which was constituted by Nadir Shah the boundary between his dominions and those of the Emperor of Delhi.\n\nFinally, in alluding to the former greater moisture of the\nLower part of the Doabs, I do not consider that the existence of former great cities in such parts, with a country well populated, with a fertile, rich and prolific soil, capable of producing the best crops, and with vegetation in abundance, proves that the rainfall was greater than now; but rather that the lands were watered by inundation canals, and that the people understood and mastered a higher system of irrigation which produced these results. The change of the river-courses higher up, however, laid waste enormous tracts of country, and the terrific sand storms from Lower Sind, passing over the parched-up soil, soon swept away cultivation, laid bare the cities, and brought desolation to half the province, changing the former bright picture of life, plenty, and beauty, into one of nothing, but a fiery sandy desert, a howling, blank wilderness.\nART. XVII.\u2014Educational Literature for Japanese Women.\n\nBy Basil Hall Chamberlain, Esq., M.R.A.S.\n\nOf all the revolutions of modern times, none has more astonished the world by its suddenness, none has met with less opposition in its rapid advance, and none has more completely and more scornfully broken through every tradition of former days, than that which, within the last few years, has launched the Empire of Japan on the path of imitation of an alien civilization brought to its shores by the natives of countries little better than barbarous at a time when Japan had already entered upon the middle age of her national existence. An appreciation of the changes introduced (even within the limited sphere of female education) does not, however, fall within the scope of this paper: for it would be difficult to prevent such an appreciation from degenerating either into a hymn of praise on the coming time of progress or into an elegy on the faded glories of the age of the quaint, the beautiful and the picturesque,\u2014productions neither of which would greatly interest the members of a Society whose object is, not the eliciting individual and often mistaken opinion, but the collecting and collating of facts, figures, and documents.\n\nSeeing then, that, whatever views may be held as to the comparative value and the fitness to an Asiatic population of the former and the present types of civilization in Japan, that of bygone days must, from its unlikeness to European models, present most interest to the Antiquary and the Oriental scholar; I propose, therefore, with as little comment as is necessary, to explain a few unfamiliar terms, and, without too often referring to the Chinese authorities on which the teaching of the Japanese moralists avowedly rests, to give some specimens of the style of writings on which, for centuries, the mind of the female youth of Japan has been fed,\npremising that, of all the divisions of the native literature, that devoted to the instruction of girls is the only one which still continues to exert any considerable influence. While the reign of the Chinese Classics has passed away never to return, and the chronicles of national glory are all but a sealed book to the rising generation; while, too, the study of the inimitable ancient models of poetry and romance is replaced by the conning over translations of Mill, Buckle, and Herbert Spencer, the far inferior literature composed for the benefit of women still retains a certain popularity among that conservative sex. Still may the \"Greater Learning for Women,\" the \"Lesser Learning for Women,\" and other similar moral disquisitions, be found in their hands, as, also, among them, many odd, but orthodox, superstitions, at which, even in the olden days, the men smiled, still count by thousands their professed or secret votaries.\n\nThe form in which the class of literature at present under consideration most frequently appears is in that of miscellanies, the popularity of many of which reaches back many generations. Such are the *Tai-h\u014d Hiyaku-nin Is-shu Momiji no Nishiki*, the *Wonna Yu-shoku Mibaye Bun-ko*, the *Jo-kun Tama Bun-ko*, the *Niyo-kun K\u014d-kiy\u014d Woshihe Kotobuki*, and the *Wonna Tei-kin \u014c-rai Yamato-ye Sh\u014d*. Occasionally, a treatise on some of the duties of women may be found printed, in smaller type, at the top of the pages of some favourite national classic, and even in the avowed miscellanies it is usual for the page to be divided into two unequal parts, the lower and larger [often a fac-simile of the running hand of some master of the art of penmanship] being devoted to the graver, and the smaller upper portion to the lighter, briefer, and more varied portions of the contents, while illustrations invariably adorn both parts. Thus, in the gracefully got up \"*Tai-h\u014d Hiyaku-nin Is-shu Momiji no Nishiki*,\"\u2014the *Hiyaku-nin Is-shu*, or \"A Hundred Odes by a Hundred Poets,\" the *Wonna Imagaica* (a set of moral maxims for women), and models of caligraphy and epistolary correspondence, occupy the place of honour, while a multitude of rules concerning dress and etiquette, poems less univer-\nsally known and admired than the \"Hundred Odes,\" short tales of filial piety, a classification of lucky and unlucky dreams, various useful and superstitious applications of the calendar, tables for ascertaining the time of high and low water, advice to women approaching their confinement, etc., crowd the top of the page.\n\nThe \"Hundred Odes,\" though, probably, the work which has, next to the Chinese Classics, had the most lasting influence on the national taste, need detain us but for a few moments. The odes are all written in the short thirty-one syllable measure which has, for nearly a thousand years, been the favourite metre of the poets of Japan, and were collected from various sources by the celebrated Teika (himself no mean versifier) in the year A.D. 1213, since which time their popularity has never waned, causing them to be household words even at the present day, when everything ancient is losing its hold upon the native mind. They are on the most varied themes, having been classed together for no other reason than that of their lyric gracefulness, and have not, any of them, a peculiar applicability to the requirements of the youthful female mind. Here are a few specimens, with regard to the rendering of which I would only beg those who may have the originals in their mind to excuse the want of literal translation,\u2014a fault hard to avoid, when taking up such delicate Oriental exotics, and transplanting them into our alien and uncongenial tongue:\n\nA thousand thoughts of tender, vague regret\nCrowd on my soul, what time I stand and gaze\nOn the soft-shining autumn moon;\u2014and yet,\nNot to me only speaks her silv'ry haze.\u00b9\n\nI gaz'd around me to behold what place\nMight hold the snookoo, that with liquid cry\nHad pierc'd the gloom\u2014but nought could I descry,\nSave, in the dawn, the moon's pale, sinking face.\u00b2\n\nThe following was the answer given by a court lady of the olden times to one of the ministers, who offered her his arm as a pillow when she complained of drowsiness at an enter-\n\n\u00b9 No. 23. \u00b2 No. 81.\ntainment, and it may serve as an example of the Japanese taste for seasoning their poetry with plays upon words:\n\nFor one short dream of love's Elysian land\nTo give a handle to foul calumny\nBy resting on the pillow of thy hand?\nNo! my fair name is far too dear to me!\u00b9\n\nSimilar to the above in form and spirit are the thousands of other stanzas crowding the pages of the women's miscellanies; for the longer and more varied poetry of pre-classical days finds in them no place.\n\nMore solid, but, we may suppose, less palatable, reading is offered by the \"Greater Learning for Women,\" the \"Lesser Learning for Women,\" the \"Woman's Imagawa,\" and other moral treatises on the peculiar duties of females, without at least one of which none of the miscellanies would be complete. In all essentials these works agree, the only difference being a slight one in regard to the degree to which the female intellect is trodden upon and insulted. All equally derive their inspiration from the Chinese Classics, though it would be a mistake to suppose that the \"Greater Learning for Women\" bears any analogy either in style or treatment to the \"Great Learning\"\u2014that grand and inimitable monument of Chinese genius. All are written in plain Japanese, comprehensible to the feeblest female capacity, and offer neither complication of matter nor ambiguity of language. The \"Imagawa for Women\" and the \"Greater Learning for Women\" may serve as types of this class of productions. The former is founded on a set of maxims composed in the year A.D. 1429 for the benefit of his son by the Daimiy\u014d Imagawa, who might be termed the Chesterfield of Japan. It may be cited as characteristic of Eastern ways of thought, that the boy, whose attention is directed to the administration of his estates, receives no advice whatever as to those conjugal relations which form the burden of the girl's instructions. The author and the date of the original composition of the \"Imagawa for Women\" are alike unknown.\n\n\u00b9 No. 67.\nThe Imagawa for Women.\n\nThings a woman should guard against:\n\n1. An obstinate frame of mind, and the (consequent) misapprehension of the \"way\" in which a woman should walk.\n\n2. Uselessly frequenting temples, when young, for the sake of amusement.\n\n3. Omitting to correct any faults on the plea of their being venial, and then venting her displeasure on others when detected.\n\n4. Indirectly publishing to strangers matters even of grave importance.\n\n5. Forgetfulness of the immense benefits received from parents, and neglect of filial piety.\n\n6. Transgressing the divinely established order by thinking lightly of her husband, and being puffed up with individual pride.\n\n7. Envy others who, though prosperous, are wicked.\n\n8. Despising others who, though poor, are honest.\n\n9. Giving herself up to pleasure, and constantly calling in blind musicians, or being addicted to sight-seeing.\n\n10. Irritability, and the nursing of a jealous disposition, all unabashed at the thought of the ridicule that will ensue.\n\n11. Allowing herself to be led astray by superficial (lit. ape-like) feminine cleverness into the habit of constantly satirizing others.\n\n12. Gossiping interference in other people's affairs, and taking pleasure in the discomfort thus caused.\n\n13. Extreme splendour in her own dress and other articles, while her attendants are left in ugliness.\n\n14. Disregard of the proper distinctions of rank, and a blind attachment to her own caprice.\n\n15. Magnifying the shortcomings of others, and being filled with the thought of her own wisdom.\n\n16. Drawing near to the persons of priests and monks, if she should ever have occasion to receive them.\n\n---\n\n1 Till about the beginning of the present century, music was almost entirely in the hands of the blind. The custom then gradually changed.\n\n2 Priests and monks, on account of their sacred character, had the right of entry to the women's apartments, which were barred against all others of their sex, excepting the nearest relations. Many were the scandals to which this custom gave rise, even within the very walls of the Palace.\n17.\u2014Ignorance of what becomes her position, manifested either by excess of ostentation or excess of simplicity.\n\n18.\u2014Failing to discriminate the good and the bad points in her subordinates, and treating them in a wrong manner.\n\n19.\u2014Laying herself open to blame by being neglectful of her father-in-law or of her mother-in-law.\n\n20.\u2014Neglecting her step-children, all unabashed at the thought of the derision such conduct excites.\n\n21.\u2014Undue familiarity with any man, even if he be a near kinsman.\n\n22.\u2014Hating those that walk in the \"way,\" and loving the companions who flatter her.\n\n23.\u2014Rudeness to guests by passing on to them the displeasure (caused by some private grievance).\n\nThe foregoing warnings are to be made the object of constant meditation; for, though neither new nor startling, they are none the less worthy of regard. With respect, then, to her household duties, a woman should apply herself in all sincerity to the task of subordinating herself in every particular to her husband, whose will is law. For know that Heaven, the Active Principle, is strong: this is the \"way\" of man. Earth, the Passive Principle, is weak: this is the \"way\" of woman. Seeing that the subjection of the Passive to the Active element is the natural law of Heaven and Earth, it is clear that if the \"way\" of husbands and wives is to be formed after the pattern of Heaven and Earth, a wife who would walk in this \"way\" must reverence her husband as if he were Heaven itself. Let her, therefore, from her earliest years, cultivate the friendship of such as are of a gentle and sincere disposition; and let her never, even for an instant, associate with vicious or low-bred companions. How faithful is the saying that, \"as water takes the shape of the vessel in which it is placed, so is a man's disposition determined by the character of his associates!\" Therefore it has been handed down from of old that she who would govern her household must begin by loving what is right; and she must be ever on her guard, mindful of the saying that \"if thou wouldst know whether a man be virtuous or wicked, ask who are his\nIt has been said that she who follows only her own will and her own caprice will bring trouble into her household; therefore (the virtuous woman) must, night and morning, turn her glance inward, that she may flee the evil, and yield herself up to the good. Human beings are born perfect in all the five cardinal virtues, and the distinction that afterwards arises between the virtuous and the wicked proceeds solely from the influences to which they respectively lay themselves open. For this reason, boys are put under the care of a teacher, from whom they may learn how to conduct themselves with propriety. But among women education is so rare that ignorance of the very existence of a moral code which they should obey, as well as obstinacy and perversity, are, alas! but too common.\n\nSeeing that a woman's destiny soon leads her to another home, where she passes under her husband's control, and has to minister to her father-in-law and to her mother-in-law, the greatest of all her duties is to be unwearingly in the practice of filial piety towards the father and mother with whom she is to dwell for so brief a space. Few are they, who, instead of spending all their time in powdering their faces and adorning their hair and persons, devote themselves to correcting the crookednesses of their hearts. She that possesses a sincere and contented spirit need never be ashamed, even though she be fallen from her high estate. She that is perverse will encounter the disdain of all thoughtful persons, even though she be possessed of countless wealth. Here is the general rule whereby a woman may know whether she be good or whether she be evil: if her husband is pleased, she may rest assured that she is virtuous; if he be unquiet and irritable, she may be certain that it is she herself who is at fault. As for the ruling of her servants, she must, by inquiring into every detail, imitate the sun and moon, that shine alike on all plants and trees, on all lands and countries,\n\n1 Cf. the Spanish: Dime con quien andas, y te dir\u00e9 qui\u00e9n eres.\n2 Viz. Humanity, Uprightness, Propriety, Wisdom, and Sincerity.\n3 This passage of itself suffices to show how completely Chinese ideas formerly ruled the Japanese mind.\nand she must treat her attendants each according to her particular disposition.\n\nSuch is the teaching of the \"Imagawa for Women.\" I next transcribe the \"Greater Learning for Women,\" one of the productions of that voluminous writer Kahibara Tokushin, who flourished during the latter part of the seventeenth and the earlier part of the eighteenth centuries:\n\nThe Greater Learning for Women.\n\nSeeing that it is a girl's destiny, on reaching womanhood, to go to a new home, and live in submission to her father-in-law and mother-in-law, it is even more incumbent upon her than it is on a boy to receive with all reverence her parents' instructions. Should her parents, through excess of tenderness, allow her to grow up self-willed, she will infallibly show herself capricious in her husband's house, and thus alienate his affection, while, if her father-in-law be a man of correct principles, the girl will find the yoke of these principles intolerable: she will hate and decry her father-in-law; and the end of these domestic dissensions will be her dismissal from her husband's house, and the covering of herself with ignominy. The parents, forgetting the faulty education they gave her, may, indeed, lay all the blame on the father-in-law. But they will be in error; for the whole disaster should rightly be attributed to the faulty education the girl received from her parents.\n\nMore precious in a woman is a virtuous heart than a face of beauty. The vicious woman's heart is ever excited; she glares wildly around her, she vents her anger on others, her words are harsh and her accent vulgar; when she speaks it is to set herself before others, to upbraid others, to envy others, to be puffed up with individual pride, to jeer at others, to outdo others,\u2014all things at variance with the \"way\" in which a woman should walk. The only qualities that befit a woman are gentle obedience, chastity, mercy, and quietness.\nFrom her earliest youth, a girl should observe the line of demarcation separating women from men; and never, even for an instant, should she be allowed to see or hear the least impropriety. The customs of antiquity did not allow men and women to sit in the same apartment,\u00b9 to keep their wearing apparel in the same place,\u00b2 to bathe in the same place,\u00b3 or to pass to each other anything directly from hand to hand.\u2074 A woman going abroad at night must in all cases carry a lighted lamp;\u2075 and (not to speak of strangers) she must observe a certain distance in her relations even with her husband and with her brethren. In our days, the women of the lower classes, ignoring all rules of this nature, behave themselves disorderly; they contaminate their reputation, and bring down reproach upon the heads of their parents and their brethren, and spend their whole lives in an unprofitable manner. Is not this truly lamentable? It is written, likewise, in the \"Lesser Learning,\" that a woman must form no friendship and no intimacy except when ordered to do so by her parents or by the \"middleman.\"\u2076 Even at the peril of her life, must she harden her heart like rock or metal, and observe the rules of propriety.\n\nIn China,\u2077 marriage is called returning, for the reason that a woman must consider her husband's home as her own, and that, when she marries, she is therefore returning to her own home. However low and needy may be her husband's position, she must find no fault with him, but consider the poverty of the household which it has pleased Heaven to give her as the ordering of an unpropitious fate. The Sage of old taught that, once married, she must never leave her husband's house.\u2078 Should she forsake the \"way,\" and be\n\n\u00b9 See the \"Record of Rites\" (\u79ae\u8a18), 12th book, 37th chapter.\n\u00b2 See ditto, 30th chap.\n\u00b3 See ditto, 12th chap., wherein it is set forth that, when a woman (except on some ceremonial occasions) has to present anything to a man, she must either put it into a box, or else place it on the ground for him to take up.\n\u2074 See ditto, same chap.\n\u2075 See the \"Record of Rites,\" 1st book, 42nd chap. In Manchuria, a similar precept may be found. All marriages in Japan being arranged by correspondence, the \"middleman,\" who acts as go-between the two families, plays a great part.\n\u2076 See the Book of Odes (\u8a69\u7d93), part I, 1st book, 7th ode, 2nd stanza.\n\u2077 See the \"Record of Rites,\" 17th book, 24th chapter.\ndivorced, shame shall cover her till her latest hour. With regard to this point, there are seven faults, which are termed \"the Seven Reasons for Divorce\": (i) a woman shall be divorced for disobedience to her father-in-law or mother-in-law; (ii) a woman shall be divorced if she fail to bear children, the reason for this rule being, that women are sought in marriage for the purpose of giving men posterity; a barren woman should, however, be retained if her heart is virtuous and her conduct correct and free from jealousy, in which case a child of the same blood must be adopted; neither is there any just cause for a man to divorce a barren wife, if he have children by a concubine; (iii) lewdness is a reason for divorce; (iv) jealousy is a reason for divorce; (v) leprosy, or any like foul disease, is a reason for divorce; (vi) a woman shall be divorced, who, by talking overmuch, and prattling disrespectfully, disturbs the harmony of relations, and brings trouble on her household; (vii) a woman shall be divorced who is addicted to stealing. All the \"Seven Reasons for Divorce\" were taught by the Sage. A woman, once married, and then divorced, has wandered from the \"way,\" and is covered with the greatest shame, even if she should enter into a second union with a man of wealth and position.\n\nIt is the chief duty of a girl living in the parental house to practise filial piety towards her father and mother. But, after marriage, her chief duty is to honour her father-in-law and mother-in-law,\u2014to honour them beyond her own father and mother,\u2014to love and reverence them with all ardour, and to tend them with every practice of filial piety. While thou honourest thine own parents, think not lightly of thy father-in-law! Never should a woman fail, night and morning, to pay her respects to her father-in-law and mother-in-law. Never should she be remiss in performing any duties they may require. With all reverence must she carry out, and never rebel against, her father-in-law's commands. On every point she must inquire of her father-in-law and\n\n1 All this passage is amplified from the \u5927\u6234\u79ae.\n2 See the \"Record of Rites,\" 12th book, 11th chap.\nmother-in-law, and abandon herself to their direction. Even if thy father-in-law and mother-in-law be pleased to hate and vilify thee, be not angry with them, and murmur not! If thou carry piety towards them to its utmost limits, and minister to them in all sincerity, it cannot be but that they will end by being friendly to thee.\n\nA woman has no particular lord. She must look on her husband as her lord, and must serve him with all worship and reverence, not despising or thinking lightly of him. The great life-long duty of a woman is obedience. In her dealings with her husband, both the expression of her countenance and the style of her address should be courteous, humble, and conciliatory, never peevish and intractable, never rude and arrogant: that should be a woman's first and chiefest care. When the husband issues his instructions, the wife must never disobey them. In doubtful cases, she should inquire of her husband, and obediently follow his commands. If ever her husband should inquire of her, she should answer to the point:\u2014to answer in a careless fashion were a mark of rudeness. Should her husband be roused at any time to anger, she must obey him with fear and trembling, and not set herself up against him in anger and disputatiousness. A woman should look on her husband as if he were Heaven itself, and never weary of thinking how she may yield to her husband, and thus escape the celestial chastisement.\n\nAs brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law are the brothers and sisters of a woman's husband, they deserve all her reverence. Should she lay herself open to the ridicule and dislike of her husband's kindred, she would offend her parents-in-law, and do harm even to herself,\u2014whereas, if she live on good terms with them, she will likewise rejoice the hearts of her parents-\n\n1 See ditto.\n2 I.e., no feudal lord.\n3 See the \u5927\u7fa9\u8a18, where Confucius sets forth the three heads under which a woman's duty may be summed up: while a girl, obedience to her parents; when married, to her husband, and when a widow, to her son. The author of the \u5112\u5bb6\u6559\u8a13 says, \"If thy father-in-law says that wrong is right, thou must unhesitatingly give in to his opinion; if thy mother-in-law says that right is wrong, then, likewise, must thou give in to her opinion. Dispute not, but commune not between right and wrong, between what is crooked and what is straight.\"\nin-law. Again, she should cherish, and be intimate with, the wife of her husband's elder brother; yes, with special warmth of affection should she reverence her husband's elder brother and her husband's elder brother's wife, esteeming them as she does her own elder brother and elder sister.\n\nLet her never even dream of jealousy. If her husband be dissolute, she must expostulate with him, but never either nurse or vent her anger. If her jealousy be extreme, it will render her countenance frightful and her accents repulsive, and can only result in completely alienating her husband from her and making her undesirable in his eyes. Should her husband act ill and unreasonably, she must compose her countenance and soften her voice to remonstrate with him; and if he be angry and refuse not to the remonstrance, she must wait over a season, and then expostulate with him again when his heart is softened. Never set thyself up against thy husband with harsh features and a boisterous voice.\n\nA woman should be circumspect and sparing in her use of words; and never, even for a passing moment, should she slander others or be guilty of uncharitableness. Should she ever hear calumny, she should keep it to herself and repeat it to none; for it is the repeating of calumny that destroys the harmony of relations and destroys the peace of a house.\n\nA woman must ever be on the alert and keep a strict watch over her own conduct. In the morning she must rise early, and at night go late to bed. Instead of sleeping in the middle of the day, she must be active in the duties of her household and must not weary of weaving, sewing, and spinning. If she had work she must not think overmuch, but must she feel her eyes and ears with charitable performances, duties, and kindness. To remedy whether Shizai or children, and other like places where there is a great concourse of people, she should go but sparingly till she reaches the age of forty.\n\nShe must not let herself be led astray by matrons and housewives and enter into an unnatural familiarity with the gods neither should she be excessively occupied in praying.\nIf only she satisfactorily perform her duties as a human being, she may let prayer alone without ceasing to enjoy the divine protection.\n\nIn her capacity of wife, she must keep her husband's household in proper order. If the wife be evil and prodigal, the house is ruined. In everything she must avoid extravagance, and both with regard to food and raiment must act according to her station in life, and never give way to luxury and pride.\n\nWhile young, she must avoid the intimacy and familiarity of her husband's kinsmen, comrades, and retainers, ever strictly adhering to the rule of separation between the sexes; and, on no account whatever, should she enter into a correspondence with a young man. Her personal ornaments and the colour and pattern of her garments should be unobtrusive. It suffices for her to be neat and cleanly in her person and in her wearing apparel. It is wrong in her, by an excess of care, to obtrude herself on other people's notice: only that which is suitable should be practised.\n\nShe must not selfishly think first of her own parents, and only secondly of her husband's relations. At New Year, on the Sekku festivals, and other like occasions, she should first pay her respects to those of her husband's house, and then to her own parents. Without her husband's permission, she must go nowhere, and she must make no presents on her own responsibility.\n\nAs a woman rears up posterity,\u2014not to her own parents,\u2014but to her father-in-law and mother-in-law, she must value the latter even more than the former, and tend them with all filial piety. Her visits, also, to the paternal house should be rare after marriage. Much more then, with regard to other friends, should it generally suffice her to send a message to inquire after their health. Again, she must not be filled with pride at the (recollection of the) splendour of her parental house, and must not make it the subject of her conversations.\n\n1 Certain festivals viz. the 7th day of the 1st month, the 3rd of the 3rd month, the 5th of the 5th month, the 7th of the 7th, and the 9th of the 9th.\nHowever many servants she may have in her employ, it is a woman's duty not to shirk the trouble of attending to everything herself. She must sew her father-in-law's and mother-in-law's garments, and make ready their food. Ever watchful on the requirements of her husband, she must fold his clothes and dust his rug, rear his children, wash what is dirty, be constantly in the midst of her household, and never go abroad but of necessity.\n\nHer treatment of her handmaidens will require circumspection. These low and aggravating girls have had no proper education; they are stupid, obstinate, and vulgar in their speech. When anything in the conduct of their mistress's husband or parents-in-law crosses their wishes, they fill her ears with their invectives, thinking thereby to render her a service. But any woman who should listen to this gossip must beware of the heartburnings it will be sure to breed. Easy is it by reproaches and disobedience to lose the love of those, who, like a woman's marriage connexions, were all originally strangers; and it were surely folly, by believing the prattle of a servant-girl, to diminish the affection of a precious father-in-law and mother-in-law. If a servant-girl be altogether too loquacious and bad, she should be speedily dismissed; for it is by the gossip of such persons that occasion is given for the troubling of the harmony of relations and the disordering of a household. Again, in her dealings with these low people, a woman will find many things to disapprove of. But if she be perpetually reproving and scolding, and spend her time in bustle and anger, her household will be in a continual state of disturbance. When there is real wrong-doing, she should occasionally notice it, and point out the path of amendment, while lesser faults should be quietly endured without anger. While in her heart she compassionates her subordinates' weaknesses, she must outwardly admonish them with all strictness to walk in the paths of propriety, and never allow them to fall into idleness. If any is to be succoured, let her not be grudging of her money; but she must not foolishly shower down her gifts on such as merely please her individual caprice, but are unprofitable servants.\nThe five worst maladies that afflict the female mind are: indocility, discontent, slander, jealousy, and silliness. Without any doubt, these five maladies infest seven or eight out of every ten women; and it is from these that arises the inferiority of women to men. A woman should cure them by self-inspection and self-reproach. The worst of them all, and the parent of the other four, is silliness. Woman's nature is passive (lit. shade \u96a0). This passiveness, being of the nature of the night, is dark. Hence, as viewed from the standard of man's nature, the foolishness of woman, fails to understand the duties that lie before her very eyes, perceives not the actions that will bring down blame upon her own head, and comprehends not even the things that will bring down calamities upon the heads of her husband and children. Neither when she blames and accuses and curses innocent persons, nor when, in her jealousy of others, she thinks to set up herself alone, does she see that she is her own enemy, estranging others and incurring their hatred. Lamentable errors! Again, in the education of her children, her blind affection induces an erroneous system. Such is the stupidity of her character, that it is incumbent on her, in every particular, to distrust herself and to obey her husband. We are told that it was the custom of the ancients, on the birth of a female child, to let it lie on the floor for the space of three days. Even in this may be seen the likening of the man to Heaven and of the woman to Earth; and the custom should teach a woman how necessary it is for her in everything to yield to her husband the first, and to be herself content with the second, place; to avoid pride, even if there be in her actions something deserving praise; and, on the other hand, if she transgress in ought and incur blame, to wend her way through the difficulty, and amend the fault, and so conduct herself as not again to lay herself open to censure; to endure without anger and indignation the jeers of others,\n\n1 See the Book of Odes, part ii. 4th book, 6th ode, 9th stanza. At birth \"the boy\" (to quote Dr. Layte's Commentary) \"is placed on a couch, to do him honour; the daughter on the ground, to show her meanness.\"\nsuffering such things with patience and humility. If a woman act thus, her conjugal relations cannot but be harmonious and enduring, and her household a scene of peace and concord.\u2014Parents! teach the foregoing maxims to your daughters from their tenderest years! copy them out from time to time, that they may read and never forget them! Better than the garments and other vessels which the fathers of the present day so lavishly bestow upon their daughters when giving them away in marriage, were it to teach them thoroughly these precepts, which would guard them as a precious jewel throughout their lives. How true is that ancient saying: \u201cA man knoweth how to spend a million pieces of money in marrying off his daughter, but knoweth not how to spend an hundred thousand in bringing up his child\u201d! Such as have daughters must lay this well to heart.\n\nAdhering to the plan announced in my prefatory remarks, I make no comment on the moral lessons inculcated in the two treatises above translated. They, indeed, speak for themselves; and any one having the least acquaintance with the doctrines of the Chinese philosophers will see how directly the moral and social ideas current in Japan flow from those in vogue in the Middle Kingdom. To the latter, among other peculiarities, must be traced the habit of ignoring all those sanctions of right conduct that other nations have borrowed from the unseen spiritual world. As will have been noticed, the practices of religion are mentioned merely to be discouraged.\n\nThe minor contents of the women\u2019s miscellanies need not detain us so long as the graver ones have done. They are, as already mentioned, extremely various. Among them, a number of short tales of filial piety occupy the chief place, and are divided into two sets of twenty-four tales each,\u2014one set being translated from the Chinese, and the other, though suggested by the Chinese stories, being of native composition. I subjoin a specimen of each.\nR\u014d-rai-shi\u00b9 (a Chinese tale of filial piety).\n\nR\u014d-rai-shi had practised filial piety from his youth upwards, and had reached the age of seventy without losing either his father or his mother. Fearful lest, if he should let them see how old and decrepit he had himself become, they might be led into sad thoughts by the contemplation of their own condition, he used to dress in baby's clothes and play pranks before them as if he had been a little child. Once, when handing them food, he purposely fell down, and then pretended to cry, all with the intention of diverting the spirits of his aged parents.\n\nThe Parsley Queen (a Japanese tale of filial piety).\n\nThe Princess was the daughter of a peasant dwelling in an obscure country village near Asuka, in the province of Yamato. Her father died whilst she was yet in her infancy, and the girl applied herself to the tending of her mother with all filial piety. One day, when she had gone out into the fields to gather some parsley (of which her mother was very fond), it chanced that Prince Sh\u014d-toku Tai-shi was making a progress to his palace at Ikaruga, and all the inhabitants of the country-side flocked to the highway along which the procession was passing, in order to behold the gorgeous spectacle and to show their respect for the Mikado's son. The girl alone, paying no heed to what was going on around her, simply continued picking her parsley, and was observed from his carriage by the Prince, who, astonished at the circumstance, sent one of his retainers to inquire into its cause. The girl replied: \"My mother bade me pick parsley, and I am following her instructions: that is the reason why I have not turned round to pay my respects to the Prince.\" The latter, being informed of her answer, was filled with admiration at the strictness of her filial piety; and, alighting at her mother's cottage on his way back, told her of the occurrence, and placing the girl in the next carriage\n\n\u00b9 The above is, of course, the Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese characters.\nto his own, took her home with him to the Imperial Palace, and ended by making her his consort, upon which the people knowing her story, gave her the name of the \"Parsley Queen.\"\n\nAs an account of the peculiarities of the epistolary style adopted by the women of Japan could interest none but the Japanese specialist and would, indeed, be fully understood by him only, nothing need be said in this place on the subject of the numerous model letters to be found in the pages of the women's miscellanies; and other reasons of equal weight forbid the introduction into this paper of translations of the numerous rules concerning etiquette and household economy, or of the biographical notices of native heroes and heroines, so plentifully met with therein. All that remains, therefore, are the superstitious applications of the calendar and other superstitious beliefs, from which, as typical of the rest, I select two for notice, viz. the Interpretation of Dreams, and the Lucky Years for Marriage.\n\nThe list of lucky and unlucky dreams to be found in some of the miscellanies is said to have been drawn up by the celebrated priest K\u00f4-b\u00f4 Dai-shi, a pioneer of Buddhism who flourished early in the ninth century of our era, and, among other inventions, is said to have invented, also, the native syllabic writing. His interpretation of dreams cannot be called a system; but, on the contrary, seems altogether arbitrary, reposing as it does, sometimes on the idea, common in Western countries, that dreams should be interpreted by the rule of contraries, and sometimes on the simpler opposite method. Thus we find that:\n\nIf one dream of ascending to Heaven, he shall rise to high rank.\nIf one dream of swallowing the Sun and Moon, he shall have good children.\nTo dream of being struck by a thunderbolt is extremely lucky.\nTo dream of worshipping the gods is extremely lucky.\nTo dream of being bitten by a snake is extremely lucky. If one dream of the Sun and Moon falling down, he shall be separated from his parents.\n\nTo dream of sweating is extremely lucky. It is unlucky to dream of eating fruit of any description. If one dream of his teeth falling out, some great misfortune will happen to him.\n\nThe system of discriminating between the lucky and unlucky years for marriage rests on the well-known ten-year cycle, with its five subdivisions of two years each,\u2014every subdivision being supposed to be under the influence of one of the five elements of Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal and Water, though the reason for attributing luck to some of the possible combinations of these elements and the contrary to others seems uncertain. Here are one or two samples of this species of fortune-telling:\n\nFor the husband to be born in a \"Wood\" year and the wife in a \"Fire\" year is extremely lucky. They will have a family of either three or five children, and any misunderstandings that may trouble the earlier years of their union are sure to be replaced by conjugal harmony, to which will be added length of days and an abundance of worldly goods. The imprecations of enemies are, however, to be redoubled; but the worship of the Shinto and Buddhist divinities will make their married life resemble the budding forth of the trees and plants in spring.\n\nFor the husband and wife to be both born in a \"Fire\" year is extremely unlucky. They may indeed, have children, but their children will be unfilial, while they themselves will be perpetually wrangling. Their circumstances will be needy, and, in every way, uncomfortable. They will do well to worship the god of the Kitchen.\n\nFor the husband to be born in a \"Fire\" year and the wife in a \"Water\" year is unlucky. They will have three children, one of whom will be a cripple. They will also be short-lived, poor, and given to squabbling. But if they be well-intentioned, their luck will improve.\nART. XVIII.\u2014On the Natural Phenomenon known in the East by the names Sub-hi-K\u0101z\u012bb, etc., etc. By J. W. Redhouse, M.R.A.S., Hon. Memb. R.S.L.\n\nThere are creations of superstitious fear or fancy, things with names in various languages, but entirely void of external entity. Such are the Jinn, the G\u00fcl, the D\u012bv, the Pari, the Ox that bears the earth, and the Fish that supports the Ox. All these have been used by Eastern poets and prose-writers to furnish endless similes, tropes, and metaphors, to the great embellishment of language.\n\nAgain, there are many natural phenomena that, ignorantly and superstitiously explained, have given rise to dread, awe, astonishment, or admiration; and, clothed with these popular explanations, have become the fertile sources of many a tale, many an allusion, many an exemplification. Such are paralysis and epilepsy, attributed sometimes to the touch of a demon, sometimes to witchcraft, and sometimes to the \"evil eye,\" as are many other diseases, corporeal or mental. Such is the rainbow, as explained in the Book of Genesis; such is Caucasus when magnified into a mountain boundary of the inhabited surface of the earth. Such, also, may we reckon the phenomenon, the subject of the present disquisition, which is known in Arabic by the names of 'Al Fajru 'l K\u0101dhib, the False Dawn, and Dhanabu's Sirh\u0101n, the Wolf's Tail. In Persian it is denominated Sub-hi Awwal, the First Dawn, Sub-hi Dur\u016bg, the False Dawn, Sub-hi K\u0101zib, the False Dawn, Sub-hi Mulamma'-Niq\u0101b, the Dawn with Variegated Veil, Sub-hi Nukhust and Sub-hi Nukhustin, the First Dawn, Sub-hi Yakum, the Primary Dawn, and Dumi Gurg, the Wolf's Tail. In Turkish it is styled Qurt Quyrugu, the Wolf's Tail. It is doubtless known in Hind\u016bst\u0101n\u012b, also, by a special name.\nThis phenomenon has been turned to account by poets and prose-writers in those various languages, as it is opposed to another natural phenomenon, the True Dawn, which shortly follows it, and which is the real daybreak, being itself followed by sunrise. This True Dawn is designated in Arabic 'Al Fajru's Sadiq; and in Persian, by Subhi Sadiq, Subhi Rast, Subhi Duwum, and seven other synonymous names. In Turkish, the Arabic and the first Persian names are applied to it.\n\nFrom these series of names it is seen that the two phenomena, the False Dawn and the True Dawn, are placed in antithesis, and are contrasted with one another. The two are supposed to be so well known, that the lexicons give no satisfactory account of either.\n\nThe Qami\u016bs explains the Wolf's Tail, by its synonym the False Dawn, but, in fact, as in gives no explanation of either False or True Dawn.\n\nThe Turkish translation of the Qami\u016bs, however, is somewhat more explicit. It adds to the gloss the longish or tallish twilight. Under it imitates the silence of its original. But, under it explains: \"There are two dawns, one, the False Dawn, makes its appearance under a longish or tallish form, and is what is termed the Wolf's Tail. The other shows itself later, and is spread along the horizon. When this takes place, he who is about to fast may no longer eat or drink lawfully. This is the True Dawn.\"\n\nThe older Persian lexicons, and their Turkish translations, give no more explanation than does the Qami\u016bs. But the Bah\u0101r\u012b-'Ajam explains by saying: \"It is a surname of the False Dawn; for they have compared the False Dawn to the tail of a wolf, by reason of its length and slenderness. In Arabic, too, it is termed identical in meaning with.\"\nSince the authorities, thus, in a great measure desert us, we are forced to have recourse to inference, as follows, in deducing the real meaning of these terms. The *True Dawn* \"spreads along the horizon, and is followed by sunrise.\" There can be no mistake as to what this really is. It is the daybreak, the morning twilight, the *crepusculum* that precedes sunrise. The *False Dawn*, on the contrary, \"is of a longish or tallish figure, resembling a *wolf's tail* in length and in slenderness.\" In contradistinction to the \"spreading along the horizon\" of the *true dawn*, I would add that the *false dawn*, like a *wolf's tail* as he runs, is of a more or less erect figure, \"tall and slender.\" It precedes the appearance of the *true dawn*. What can this be? Is it not the *Zodiacal Light*, described as follows in Brande's \"Dictionary of Science,\" London, 1867:\n\n\"*Zodiacal Light, in Astronomy, a faint nebuluous aurora which surrounds the sun in the plane of its equator; first observed by Kepler, who supposed it to be the solar atmosphere; first accurately described by Dominic Cassini, who gave it the name by which it is now known. It is visible immediately before sunrise or after sunset, in the place where the Sun is about to appear or has just quitted in the horizon. It has a flat, lenticular form, as represented in the annexed figure, extending from the horizon obliquely upwards, and following the course of the ecliptic, or rather of the sun's equator. For this reason it is scarcely visible in our latitudes, except in those seasons when the plane of the Sun's equator is most nearly perpendicular to the horizon. The most favourable times for observing it are in the months of April or May in the evening, or at the opposite season of the year (October, November) before sunrise. At other times, the plane of the solar equator being more oblique, and the luminous pyramid in the same degree, it rises so little above the horizon that its light is effaced by the atmosphere of the earth.*\n\nEastern authors make no mention of a *wolf's tail* as seen\nat night after the evening twilight. This circumstance constitutes a difficulty in theoretically identifying the *False Dawn* with the *Zodiacal Light*; but it may be partly explained by the fact that there is no obligatory service of divine worship imposed on the Muslim world after that of the end of twilight. As day approaches, however, matters are different. The first obligatory service is performable from the appearance of the \"Second Dawn,\" which is \"the brightness that spreads along the horizon,\" until the time of sunrise. A fast begins also, obligatorily, with the (true) dawn.\n\nHere, then, is a necessity for accurately observing the commencement of the dawn, and for distinguishing between it and any other phenomenon that may be mistaken for it. Again, the year and month of Islam being lunar, the month of obligatory fasting, Ramadhan, is advanced every year, in comparison with the seasons and equinoxes, about eleven days, so as to traverse the whole solar year once in about thirty-three years. The Zodiacal Light will therefore be visible before dawn, before the true dawn, whenever the Mu'edhdhin (Mu'ezzin) prepares to call the faithful to early matins towards the latter part of autumn and beginning of winter; and more especially will his attention be called to it when the month of fasting, during four or five years in every cycle of thirty-three, corresponds with the latter part of autumn or beginning of winter. And, as the fast is repeated daily for a whole month, the visibility of the Zodiacal Light before dawn will begin when Ramadhan commences towards the beginning of winter; and will not cease until Ramadhan ends towards the latter part of autumn. It will be observable, therefore, more or less, in Ramadhan, during perhaps eight or ten years in each cycle of thirty-three, and yearly in some one month or other; perhaps in some two months.\n\nThe Mu'edhdhin will, therefore, frequently be called upon to distinguish between the dawn\u2014the True Dawn\u2014and any appearance that resembles it. He will learn that there is a frequently recurring luminosity visible before the True Dawn, mocking this and himself, as it were. Having learnt\nthis from experience, he will naturally distinguish the two appearances by special names, and the legist will assist him to do so. Hence will arise the terms First or False Dawn (when the service of worship must not be performed, under pain of invalidity; and when fasting is not yet obligatory) and the Second or True Dawn, the harbinger of coming day, when worship and fasting become obligatory.\n\nA short time ago, possibly at present still, European science had not satisfactorily determined the nature of the Zodiacial Light, though it was seen to be evidently dependent on the Sun, never being visible but in his proximity. We need not, then, be surprised if Eastern astronomers and philosophers have failed to explain it, but have simply recorded their knowledge of its existence, if their False Dawn be our Zodiacial Light. Europeans have put forward more than one theory to account for its occurrence; and Eastern poets or fictionists, those who imagine the Bull and the Fish that support the world, have also explained, in their imaginative way, the appearance of the False Dawn.\n\nEvery one knows, in the East, that the level plain of the Earth is surrounded by the impassable barrier of Caucasus, \u062c\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0644\u0652 \u0623\u064e\u0644\u0652\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0641\u0650, from behind which the sun rises in the east, and behind which he sets in the west. The True Dawn is caused by the incidence of the sun\u2019s rays on the higher strata of the atmosphere, at first visible in a point or limited space of the horizon just above the distant summits of Caucasus, and gradually increasing in breadth \u201calong the horizon,\u201d in height above it, and in brightness, until the sun himself emerges from behind the barrier, and fills the whole earth with the light of day.\n\nWhat then is, according to Easterns, the False Dawn, the Wolf\u2019s Tail?\n\nThere is in Caucasus, in Eastern Caucasus, some distance below its summit, a chink, a hole, a tunnel. When the Sun, then, approaching the skirts of Caucasus beyond that barrier to our abode, begins to shoot his rays upwards, these oblique rays, before they can reach the upper strata of the atmosphere on this side of Caucasus, by passing over its summits, strike\nthrough that chink, hole, or tunnel, and send a long, slender beam of feeble light, obliquely, into the atmospheric strata adjacent to the mountain; and hence the shape of the phenomenon,\u2014hence, also, its small luminous power. Furthermore, as the Sun continues to rise, his rays cease to be projected in a direction fitted to pass through that chink; the feeble light of the False Dawn fades away; darkness again sets in for a short space, until the True Dawn begins to make its appearance. Such is the mythical explanation current among Easterns in elucidation of the phenomenon they term the First or False Dawn, and the Wolf's Tail.\n\nThe following are specimens from Persian poets of the use of some of the epithets by which they vary the distinction between the First or False, and the Second or True, Dawns:\n\nHe (the Emperor Jihangir) is a ray from the forehead of the Lord of the Conjunction (Timur); the Second Dawn is a witness to the First Dawn.\u2014Julalayi-Tabataba.\n\nOne party were like the First Dawn; their faces all fire; their hair being their smoke.\u2014Bagiri-Kashi.\n\nOne night his eyes went not in the direction of the place of daybreak: he kept not watch and ward at the gate of the First Dawn.\u2014Wahhi-Harawi.\n\nThe awakened-hearted man is jealous of the First Dawn; for, on the carpet of life, he hath hope of another dawn.\u2014Sa'di.\nThe splendour of the *False Dawn* exists at a time when no ray of the *True Dawn* is in existence.\u2014*H\u0101t\u012bf\u012b.*\n\nTake away the cotton-wool out of thy ears; for the white ear is the rise of a dawn, the *Second Dawn* of which is the shroud.\u2014*S\u0101'ib.*\n\nIn the world, (honest) beamingness of countenance is needful unto thee; like the *Second Dawn*, practise thou truth-speakingness.\u2014*Mir Khusr\u0101w.*\n\nTogether with impecuniosity, why is it necessary for me, like the evening primrose (*Mirabilis jalapa*), to blossom at thy banquet at the time of the *Latter Dawn*?\u2014*Asar.*\n\nUnto the darwish there accrues no profit from purity of heart; the *True Dawn* hath its loaf (*the Sun*) moistened with blood (*red with vapour*).\u2014*S\u0101'ib.*\n\nWho hath ever breathed of love for thee, in opposition to the truth? Remorse for that breath has not profited like the *Latter Dawn.*\u2014*Jam\u0101lu-'d-D\u012bn Salm\u0101n.*\n\nExamples of the \"Wolf's Tail.\"\n\nWhen the (*true*) dawn shot up a beam of light from out\nof the Wolf's Tail, the dog and the shepherd took to lying down.\u2014Nizami.\n\nIs it the Wolf's Tail, or is it a gazelle's tail? For the dawn binds on (to the zephyr), everywhere, loads of musk.\u2014Kh\u0101q\u0101n\u012b.\n\nA doubtful allusion to the \"true dawn,\" and, by implication, to the \"false dawn,\" in Arabic, that I have quite recently met with, is differently explained by Jawhari in the S\u012bhah, voce \u064a\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0637\u0650\u0642\u064f, and is as follows. It is the only Arabic instance I can offer in illustration.\n\nVerily the two-skirted night hath passed away, and the dawn hath become a reality.\n\nThe word \u064a\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0637\u0650\u0642\u064f means a skirt or flap of a tent, a strip of stuff added on to the bottom of the tent wall, to close the interval between the tent wall and the ground, in cold weather. The dual \u064a\u064e\u0646\u0652\u0637\u0650\u0642\u064e\u0627\u062a\u064c may mean the two flaps on the two opposite sides of a tent, or two flaps added one below the other when the interval is wide. I take the latter view, in order to explain the above-given saying, as follows:\n\nBearing in mind the \"chink in Caucasus\" as producing the false dawn, and remembering that the sky is commonly compared to a tent, I imagine that here the idea has been used of a tent with two flaps, one below the other. \"The double-flapped night has passed away\"; i.e., the false dawn has already shown itself through the interval of the two flaps of the sky at the horizon, the night has therefore come to an end, and daybreak has really appeared. Jawhari explains the passage by supposing that evening and morning are the two edges of the night; that the two-edged night has passed away, and that dawn has become a reality. But if the evening and morning have passed away, as edges of the night, the dawn must have passed away also.\n\nHaving thus endeavoured to show an analogy between the\nFalse Dawn or Wolf's Tail and the Zodiacal Light, it may be hoped that opportunities will arise for an authoritative solution of this interesting question at the various observatories existing in India, or at some of the naval stations dotted along the coasts where Arabic or Persian is spoken, or by an independent astronomical orientalist who may have occasion to trace out and compare the phenomena with their names. If the False Dawn prove to be other than the Zodiacal Light, meteorologists, astronomers, and orientalists will feel deeply indebted to any one who will fully investigate and explain the true nature of the luminosity thus distinguished in the East from the dawn that is followed by sunrise.\n\nWhen we are informed in our scientific guide-books that the Zodiacal Light was first observed by Kepler, who flourished from about A.D. 1595 to A.D. 1635, and that its name was given to it by the elder Cassini in A.D. 1683, those guides naturally mean to say that the first observation and naming of the luminosity by modern European astronomers was the work of those two eminent men. But, if the \"False Dawn\" be our Zodiacal Light, it has been observed and named in the East from the early days of Isl\u0101m, if we can trace it no farther back. The Q\u0101m\u016bs, in which it is mentioned, as we have already seen, by its two Eastern names, was written before the year A.H. 816 (A.D. 1413), when its author died. But Lane quotes the Mugrib as also giving both names; and this work was compiled before A.H. 610 (A.D. 1213), the date of its author's decease, four hundred years before Kepler's time.\n\nIt is certainly singular that Ptolemy, the great astronomical writer of the Greeks, who lived in Egypt in the second century of our era, a country where the Zodiacal Light is naturally a conspicuous phenomenon, and who was a great celestial observer, appears to have overlooked this remarkable appearance. Had he mentioned it under any name whatever, it could hardly have remained unknown to modern Europe till the days of Kepler and Cassini.\n\nI find that in the Hebrew original of the Pentateuch, the word \u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05d7\u05b7\u05e8, Arabic \u0634\u064e\u0651\u0647\u0652\u0631, is used to express \"the morning,\"\n\"the dawn,\" \"the daybreak;\" and, in one passage, it is rendered in the Septuagint by the word \u1f48\u03c6\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2. According to Liddell and Scott, this word \u1f48\u03c6\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 is also the name of a mythical dog, son of Typhon and Echidna, that kept the herds of Geryon in the island Erytheia, and was there killed by Hercules in his tenth labour. \u1f48\u03c6\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 is elsewhere styled \"the two-headed dog of Geryon,\" killed by Hercules when he captured the oxen of Geryon in Erytheia, the fabulous island under the rays of the setting sun.\n\nA question here arises: Is there any connexion between the \"dog\" of Geryon, and the \"wolf\" of the \"wolf's tail\" of the Arabs? The two heads of \u1f48\u03c6\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 may refer to the two apices of the Zodiacal Light, one visible before daydawn, the other after nightfall, and both yielding a glimmer of light to assist in the watch kept by night over their flocks and herds by pastors. Furthermore, \u0633\u0631\u062e\u0627\u0646 is explained in the Qamus as being also the name of a certain dog. So that, although the Persian \u0633\u0631\u062e\u0627\u0646 points to the wolf alone, the Arabic \u0633\u0631\u062e\u0627\u0646 may well be rendered by \"Sirh\u0101n's Tail;\" and \"Sirh\u0101n,\" the dog, may possibly be a descendant, mythically, of \u1f48\u03c6\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2. If so, one more ancient myth becomes resolved into a natural phenomenon. Do the Vedic hymns throw any light on this subject?\n\nIt is said that the identity of the \"False Dawn\" with the \"Zodiacal Light\" has been long ago established by scientific travellers, and that this fact is well known. I have not yet succeeded in ascertaining a passage in any author where this interesting discovery is recorded and buried; for neither Golius, Meninski, Freytag, Bianchi, Mandj\u00e9ri, Johnson, nor Lane have been aware of the circumstance, and all content themselves by translating the Oriental expressions by the term \"the False Dawn.\" It is four or five years that I have gradually acquired a feeling that this \"False Dawn\" can be no other than our \"Zodiacal Light,\" and I shall be most gratified if any authoritative identification shall enable future lexicographers to treat the terms as synonymous, so that coming generations of Oriental students and scholars\nmay be as well aware of the fact as they are that \nmeans \"a tail,\" and \"a wolf.\"\n\nPalgrave (Journey through Central and Eastern Arabia; \nfifth edition, 1859, p. 186, l. 31) says: \"The Zodiacal Light, \nalways discernible in these transparent skies, but now at its \nfull equinoctial display, would linger cone-like in the west \nfor full three hours after sunset, perfectly distinct in colour, \nshape, and direction from the last horizontal glimmer of \ndaylight; while its re-appearance in the east long before \nmorning could only be confounded by inexperience with the \nearly dawn.\" Had he but mentioned the \"false dawn,\" or \nthe \"wolf's tail,\" the question would have been settled. \nAlas! he is silent on this point.\nART. XIX.\u2014On a Chinese Version of the S\u0101\u1e45khya K\u0101rik\u0101, etc., found among the Buddhist Books comprising the Tripi\u1e6daka, and two other works. By the Rev. Samuel Beal, M.A.\n\nAmong many valuable works found in the Buddhist Tripi\u1e6daka recently presented to the India Office by the Japanese Government, there are three I will briefly notice, with a view to awaken some interest in this large collection now at the disposal of the student.\n\nThe first is an early life of Buddha, translated by Ta-lin (Mah\u0101\u015b\u0101la) and Kong-meng-tsiang during the later Han dynasty. This dynasty ruled over China from A.D. 25 to A.D. 190. So that the date of the work under notice can be fixed between these limits. The translators probably lived towards the end of the dynasty\u2014at any rate Dr. Edkins places Kong-meng-tsiang about 190 A.D. This date, however, must have reference to his death rather than to the time of his translations, if we are to place him during the later Han. I think we may safely date the work before us about 150 A.D., if not earlier. The book is a small one consisting of two parts comprising seven sections. The first chapter begins with the election of Dipa\u1e45kara for the Supreme Buddhahood, and the book ends with the conquest of M\u0101ra and his host. This alone proves its primitive character. It is, perhaps, a second and separate translation of the earliest version of the Lalita Vistara. It is known that the first translation of this book into Chinese was made by Chu-fa-lan and another, about the year 70 A.D. This work is lost. It is true that M. Stanislas Julien states that he had seen the Fo-pen-hing-king, and that it was in verse. But this work, which was composed by \u0100\u015bvagho\u1e63a, is the one translated into Chinese by\n\nIt is hoped that the original Texta will appear in a future number of the Journal of the Society.\u2014Ed.\nRatnamegha of the Sung dynasty, and is identical with the Buddha-tcharita mentioned by Burnouf, and of a much later date than the Fo-pen-hing-king of Chu-fa-lan. Another name for this primitive work we are told was the Fang-teng-pen-ki-king. Now the translation before us is called the Sew-hing-pen-ke-king, which is only another form of the first title. This, taken in connexion with the brevity and completeness of the work, justifies us in supposing that the original, from which the translation was made, was the copy from which the expanded version known in Tibet and China under the title Lalita-Vistara, or Ta-Chwong-yan-king, was afterwards prepared. I do not intend to offer any lengthened remarks on this book, but will simply state that it contains forty double pages, and the headings of chapters as follows:\n\n1. In-pin. Exhibiting changes.\n2. Pu-sa-kong-shin.\n\nBodhisatwa descends into the world spiritually or as a Spirit or God. [In this chapter the conception is spoken of as the result of the descent of the Holy Spirit into the womb.]\n\n3. Athletic contests.\n4. Excursions for observation.\n5. Leaving his home, or, as it has been well called, the Grand Renunciation.\n6. The six years fast.\n7. The conquest of M\u00e2ra.\n\nThere is another life of Buddha bound up in the same volume with the former, and translated during the Wu dynasty, i.e. between 222 A.D. and 264 A.D., by a lay Buddhist called Chi-kian. This writer, whom Edkins describes as belonging to the Massagetae, flourished in China about 250 A.D. His work is entitled \u201cThe Felicitous Advent of the Royal Prince\u201d (Ta-tsen-suy-ying-pen-k\u2019i-king). It is in two parts, comprising 36 pages, and ends with the conversion of the Kasy\u00e1pas. It is curious to notice how the legends after Buddha\u2019s conquest of M\u00e2ra are gradually added in the course of years, until we get to the expanded and verbose type represented by the Lalita Vistara.\nAnother work I may name as found among the books of the Tripitaka is a Chinese copy of Dhammapada. This work is known in Chinese as Fa-khen-king or Fa-khon-pi-u-king, that is, Parables illustrating Scriptural Extracts or Verses. The Preface states that these extracts were made from the Buddhist Canon at an early date, and were arranged in their present form by Dharmatrata, the uncle of Vasumitra. Vasumitra presided over the last council held by Kanishka; hence we may suppose that Dharmatrata lived somewhere in the early part of the first century B.C. The Chinese copy agrees with the Pali, except that there are eight sections prefixed to the work. The ninth section agrees with the first of the Pali, the subject being \"Twin Verses.\"\n\nAs I am about to publish a translation of this work, I need not, here, add any more to these remarks.\n\nA third work I shall name is a Chinese translation of the S\u0101\u1e45khya K\u0101rik\u0101 of Kapila Rishi. This book is called the \"Golden Seventy Shaster,\" and in a note the Chinese editor states that this is a work composed by the \"Heretical Teacher Kapila Rishi illustrating the twenty-five principles (Tutwas), and does not belong to the Dharma of Buddha.\"\n\nIt was translated into Chinese during the Ch'\u00ean dynasty, which ruled from 557 to 583 A.D. The translator's name is Chin-te, which may be perhaps the same as the Sanskrit Vijn\u0101na, but we can hardly suppose him to be the same as the Vijn\u0101na Bhikshu referred to by Mr. Wilson as the author of the S\u0101\u1e45khya S\u0101ra, and also of the S\u0101\u1e45khya Pravachana Bh\u0101sya. At any rate the date of the Chinese version is satisfactory, as it proves that the S\u0101\u1e45khya K\u0101rik\u0101 and the Bh\u0101sya of Gaurap\u0101da, which I find embodied in the work, were known in China so early as the middle of the sixth century A.D. Mr. Colebrooke considered Gaurap\u0101da, the Scholiast or the K\u0101rik\u0101, to be the same as the preceptor of the celebrated teacher S\u0101\u1e45kara \u0100ch\u0101rya, whom Mr. Wilson adds there is reason to place in the eighth century, and then, he continues, \"how long before this the K\u0101rik\u0101s existed in their present form we have no means of knowing.\" It is satisfactory to be able to produce a Chinese version made in the sixth century.\nI have carefully compared the Aphorisms of the Chinese version with the translation of Mr. Colebrooke, and I find that they agree in a marked manner. The numbers, indeed, are different, for there are altogether 82 verses or K\u0101rik\u0101s in the Chinese, but the redundant Aphorisms are nearly all extracted from the Bh\u0101shya. Where the two versions of the text are compared, the Chinese translation is shown to be most accurate; and the comments, which are plain and voluminous, leave nothing to be desired by way of elucidation.\n\nThe following is the result of a comparison of the order of the Aphorisms in the two translations:\n\n| Aph. | Sanskrit | Chinese |\n|------|----------|---------|\n| 1    |          |         |\n| 2    |          |         |\n| 3    |          |         |\n| 4    |          |         |\n| 5    |          |         |\n| 6    |          |         |\n| 7    |          |         |\n| 8    |          |         |\n| 9    |          |         |\n| 10   |          |         |\n| 11   |          |         |\n| 12   |          |         |\n| 13   |          |         |\n| 14   |          |         |\n| 15   |          |         |\n| 16   |          |         |\n| 17   |          |         |\n| 18   |          |         |\n| 19   |          |         |\n| 20   |          |         |\n| 21   |          |         |\n| 22   |          |         |\n| 23   |          |         |\n| 24   |          |         |\n| 25   |          |         |\n| 26   |          |         |\n| 27   |          |         |\n| 28   |          |         |\n| 29   |          |         |\n| 30   |          |         |\n| 31   |          |         |\n| 32   |          |         |\n| 33   |          |         |\n\nAphorisms 3, 4, 5, 6, of the Sc. are embodied in the Ch.

XX.\u2014The Rock-cut Phrygian Inscriptions at Doganlu.\n\nBy Edward Thomas, F.R.S.\n\nAt the Meeting of the Royal Asiatic Society on the 18th March our Secretary adverted to the progress I had been able to make in the interpretation of the Phrygian Inscriptions at Doganlu. I am, therefore, unwilling to let the current Number of the Journal go forth without some notice of the present state of this investigation, though the time and the space conceded to me admit only of a general outline. Besides which, the available facsimiles, on which any decipherment must be based, are faulty and conflicting in themselves, though we may hope before long to be in a condition to obtain direct photographs of the monuments themselves, which will set at rest many of the disputed readings. The bulk of these epigraphs have been before the public for many years, and have exercised the ingenuity of several distinguished scholars. The main obstacle to the success of Colonel Leake's and of other contemporary investigations was the expectation of a higher standard of Greek than the language of the legends authorized, and which was, therefore, pronounced to be barbarous and unintelligible. But the admission that the leading word designating the rock-cut faces themselves was nothing but the Latin *Eides* led me to inquire whether there might not be a larger proportion of Latin forms in the rest of the inscriptions. That this would appear to be the case is demonstrated by the use among others of the words *Aforeep Acuser* (1), *Marrepes*.\n\n1 List of modern authorities on the subject: W. Hamilton, *Egyptian*, London, 1809. Jablonsky, *Lingua Lycaonica*, Leyden, 1806; iii. Chandlier's *Asia Minor*, 1817, 272 et seq.; Leake, *Asia Minor*, 1824.

I ventured to propound a theory in the pages of our Journal, during the incomplete stages of the scientific development of Eastern Pal\u00e6ography, to the effect, that the Aryan races in their various ascertained migrations, whether forced or voluntary, never originated or perfected an alphabet proper or exclusively applicable to their own form of speech,\\(^1\\) but invariably, as far as extant documents went to show, simply adopted and adapted the literal signs, however diversified, they found current in the lands of their advanced progress. This theory by no means implies that the dwellers in the ancient Aryan nidus could not write, but it singularly tallies with Grote's idea that, like the Archaic Greeks, they did not care to write.\\(^2\\) The more settled commercial civilization of the old countries into which they intruded had necessitated a class of professional scribes, without whose aid ordinary business could not have been carried on.\n\nPrior to the discovery of the Moabite Stone, of its now admitted context and of the positive impressions of the letters of the original st\u00e8le, no pal\u00e6ographer could have ventured to say that these Archaic Gr\u00e6co-Latin records were expressed in, pro tanto, the same letters as the coincident Biblical text of the Aramaean Stone; and yet it is so, letter for letter identities follow on, and there is no break in the continuity, even to the exclusion of the redundant \u0398=\u0398, till we reach the inevitable Aryan \u03a5, which, in this case, stands as the concluding (or 22nd) letter of the alphabet, and, in this sense, recalls the traditional primitive Greek alphabet of 16 letters, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b4, \u03b5, \u03b9, \u03ba, \u03bb, \u03bc, \u03bd, \u03bf, \u03c0, \u03c1, \u03c3, \u03c4, and \u03c5.\\(^3\\)\n\nThe alphabet of the Moabite Stone\u2014of the date of 896 B.C.\u2014at present the earliest example of its class we are able\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Meeting of the R.A.S. 9th April, 1866.

The Royal road from Susa to Sardis of Herodotus (v. 52) must have constituted a well-beaten track and trade route from old-world times, and letters travelled lightly in accompanying invoices and lists of beasts of burden. One of the most interesting points in the general comparison of these alphabets is the number of similar identities of configuration to be found in the Phrygian Palaeography as compared with that which the Etruscans and other nationalities carried with them to the lands of their adoption; including the dominance of the F [digamma] in Italy, a letter discarded by the later Greeks, which is in itself a striking incident. These, and many other questions of a similar character, I can merely allude to in this place, but trust to examine more at large in a future paper.\n\nThe next imperfect Greek epigraph, in serial order, of any extent, is found in the Carian record at Abu-Simbel (of the 7th cent. B.C.), containing the name of Peammeticus.\n\nThis inscription presents us with a closer relation to Phoenician teachings, in contradistinction to the Aramaisms of the Phrygian writings, as well as a far more decisive preponderance of Greek, whose alphabet rejects the F, but retains the Semitic \u0398, and is enlarged by the new letters X and \u03a8, though it still remains deficient in the eventually incorporated Z, \u039e, and \u03a9.\n\n1 M. Lenormant, who has made Ancient Palaeography his special study, observes: \"La grande inscription de M\u00e9sa, roi de Moab, grav\u00e9e sur la st\u00e8le de Dhib\u00e1n... c'est \u00e0 la fois le plus ancien et le plus pr\u00e9cieux monument parmi ceux qui nous sont parvenus de l'\u00c9pigraphie ph\u00e9nicienne, tant de l'\u00e9criture qu'elle pr\u00e9sente avec des caract\u00e8res form\u00e9s et une dans la forme de certains caract\u00e8res, qui r\u00e9v\u00e8le plusieurs si\u00e8cles d'usage ant\u00e9rieur de ce type graphique.\"\u2014M. Lenormant, L'Alphabet Ph\u00e9nicien, Paris, 1874, vol. i. p. 128.\n\n2 It is a question if this is not the mere Semitic \u0398.\n\n3 Boeckh, iii. 507; Lepsius, vi. Bl. 99, 631; Herodotus, ii. 164.\nThe Carians, who were \u03b4\u03b9\u03b3\u03bb\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u03b9, seem to have had no digamma in their second vernacular\u2014though their neighbours, the Lycians, rejoiced in a superabundance of these letters. The \u0396, however, seems to have been a very common letter in the Carian dialect, to judge from the bilingual inscriptions at Cadyanda,\u00b9 where we find it duplicated thus in the word ZZ\u039b\u039b\u039b, in the Greek version \u03a3\u0391\u039b\u039b\u0391\u03a3\u03a3, \u201ca tomb.\u201d\u00b2 The Lycians appear, also, to have combined the double \u0396 into \u039e, another form of the proper \u039e.\n\n**THE INSCRIPTIONS.**\n\nThese inscriptions are cut on the surface of the rock on or around the central architectural representation of the front of a temple, Doric in character, but having more the appearance of prototypes than of adaptations of that order,\u00b3 and, as far as the obvious imitation of wooden structures permits us to judge, are surmounted by the crude outlines of a caput bovis.\u2074 They are designated in the legends by the term \u1f08\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2, which may imply a house, a quasi-temple, a tomb, or a cenotaph. It is probably under the latter aspect we must view them, for no chambers and no deposits have been discovered in the rock to the rear of the front face. The boustroph\u00e9don inscriptions are inserted, somewhat at hazard, in regard to their position or proximity to the leading device, the details of which will be found in the following summary. It is a matter of importance to remark the similarity of the temple fronts with those of Lycia, and the contrast presented in the Tombs and Tumuli of Alyattes\u2075 and\n\n\u00b9 Fellows, Lycia, p. 116, and woodcut of tomb, p. 117.

But the local races, in borrowing Oriental alphabets, probably learnt the associate use of the letters in serial order as numerical signs.\n\nThe age definition of 29 (No. 4) will scarcely be contested, but the more important epoch date of 301 (No. 5) may form a subject of controversy both as to the corresponding numbers and as to their interpretation by any appropriate era of which we have cognizance. As for the date itself, I can make no use of it for the purposes of fixing the period of any given Phrygian king. It is apparently only the record of the date, when a certain Chersonesian affixed his name, in independent action, but possibly with some authority, to the leading epigraphy of the central sculpture.\n\nThough \u1f28\u03b4\u03b1 confessedly meant in ancient Greek, 301, yet the question has already been raised, in an adverse sense\u2014as to how it can be proved that \u1f28 stood for 300 at so primitive a stage of alphabetical writing? It is clear, however, that if this Oriental method of dating, alphabetically, was in existence at the time, the 21st letter of the Aramaean alphabet of Mesha's st\u00e8le could stand for nothing but 300. The determination of the era to which the 301 refers, is, therefore, of less importance than it promised to prove on its first discovery.\n\nThe only era that suggests itself as at all suitable is that of the Eastern Heraclide, whom Herodotus tells us could count 22 generations or 500 years, before Gyges, whose\n\n---\n\n1 \"The government, which formerly belonged to the Heraclids, passed in the following manner to the family of Croesus, who were called Mermnad\u00e6. Cambyses, whom the Greeks call Myrsilus, was tyrant of Sardis and a descendant...\"\naccession is now conclusively assigned to 716 B.C. The initial date, therefore, from which we should have to reckon would be 1221 B.C., and the entry of TA on the Phrygian rocks would fall-in with 920 B.C.\n\n**Names.**\n\nThe group of royal names recorded on these rocks, when critically examined, ought to supply important data towards determining the dynastic family to whom they refer.\n\nThe leading name of the common ancestor is unfortunately undetermined, appearing as it does under the conflicting palaeographic outlines supplied by the only two authorities who have visited the site. Texier, who transcribed the legends mechanically, in facsimile, states that he took unusual care in the process, because the characters were new to him. His transcript runs, in distinct letters, EPEKYN. Whereas Steuart, who prided himself\n\nof Alceus, son of Hercules. For Agron, son of Ninus, grandson of Belus, great-grandson of Alceus, was the first of the Heraclidae who became king of Sardis; and Candaules, son of Myrsus, was the last. They who ruled over this country before Agron were descendants of Lydus, son of Atys, from whom this whole people, anciently called Maeonians, derived the name of Lydians. The Heraclidae, . . . having been entrusted with the government by these princes, retained the supreme power in obedience to the declaration of an oracle: they reigned for 22 generations, a space of 505 years, the son succeeding to the father to the time of Candaules.\"\u2014Herodotus, i. 7.\n\n1 This is no new proposition for the application of this scheme of testing ancient dates, as may be seen by M.

If this is the correct form, an attempt might be made to render the opening letters \u03a0\u0395 for \u03c6\u03b5\u03c1, as the Phrygians were said to be unable to pronounce the \u03c6. For the rest, we can quote with some confidence the names of Menes, Atya, and Midas. The two former represent some of the earliest reminiscences of the Phrygian kings. The name of Menes is directly or indirectly associated with Egyptian traditions, and that of Atya is connected with the most primitive myths of the home soil. Midas, though so distinctively Phrygian, carries with it less evidence of remote antiquity.\n\nBut the Menes or Manes, with its special prefix of Baba, obviously points to very old-world stories, and the name of Atya equally secured among the local races the now too common title of \u03c0\u03b1\u03c0\u03ac\u03c2.

It has been copied evidently with great care by Texier, and is reproduced on two occasions, in the MS. facsimile p. 157, and, in the lithograph of the Rock front, in Plate 92. Unfortunately, the two copies do not agree; in the former he gives the legend as \\( \\text{\u0393\u0395\u0399\u03a1\u03a0\u03a4\u039f\u03a1} \\), while in the latter, where he was tied down to the filling-in of the space afforded by the two square compartments which occupy the base of the ornamental pilaster to the right, his copy runs as \\( \\text{\u03a3\u0395\u03a1\u03a1\u039f\u03a1} \\). The increased height and greater length of the tablet above of this case may be readily visible, but they may be due to the mere demands of space, which could not admit the top line on the general level of the head lines, within the green area of the square. I may add that the facsimile Plate shows that the lower compartments on each side, immediately above the position of this entry, are filled-in with a pattern in the form of a cross, unlike the design of the ordinary four wooden diamonds, which supply the rest of the ornamentation, and moreover the corresponding pair of foot squares, to the left, are retained as blank surfaces, unornamented and unscratched. If we call this upon Mr. Steward's attention, he would probably say that it would also seem that the Tablet itself has had an addition made to its height by the cut and extending the cutting at the base, as the entrance now varies considerably from the equal proportions of the two associate Rock-cut faces in the same locality. Stewart has also reproduced this graphic addition to the design of the rock front no less than three times, twice in his Plates, where he gives the legend at full length, but at the foot of the general design, free from all involvement with the pattern of the rock-cut frontages, which might have complicated him in its execution, and once in his plates. From all these inscriptions it is determined as to the reading \\( \\text{\u03a3\u0395\u03a1\u03a1\u039f\u03a1} \\), and in no case does he discriminate the enlarged height of the T, which is palpable in both Texier's copies. His final s may have been an anticipated finish to a presumed Greek word, but Texier seems to be quite clear as to the r, though it must be admitted that a very slight slope of the upper limb and a scarcely perceptible backward continuation at the foot would convert it into a z or s. The figures \\( \\text{T\u03c3f} \\), assuming them to be such, would stand for \\( \\text{378} \\), or, omitting the \\( \\text{f} \\) from the reading alphabet, for \\( \\text{368} \\)\u2014which would bring the whole date down to the period of the reign of the last king of the dynasty, better with the period of a retouching of the Tablet rather than with the epoch of its primary erection. On the other hand, the word \\( \\text{\u03a3\u0395\u03a1\u03a1\u039f\u03a1} \\), with the avowed uncertainties of \\( \\gamma \\varepsilon \\) and \\( \\kappa \\varepsilon \\), is too near an approach to an appropriate term, at the foot of a quasi-tomb\u2014emanating from \\( \\text{\u039d\u0395\u039a} \\) \\( \\text{\u03a3\u0395\u03a1\u03a1\u039f\u03a1} \\), Sanskrit \\( \\text{\u039d\u0391\u039a} \\), Latin \\( \\text{\u039d\u0395\u039e} \\), \\( \\text{\u039d\u0395\u03a1\u03a1\u039f\u03a1} \\), to admit of our receiving the three last letters as a definitive date; especially in the absence, or possibly obscured entry, of the divisional three dots, which in the parallel cases so palpably mark the isolation of the literal figures.

Carr Woods, Esq.\n\nThe Society therefore has elected eight Resident Members against a loss of four Resident, and seven Non-Resident against a loss of one Non-Resident.\n\nOn the personal history of some of those we have lost a few words will now be said.\n\n(1). The late Sir John Kaye, F.R.S., the son of John Kaye, Esq., at one time Solicitor to the Bank of England, was born in 1814, and, after some time spent at Eton, entered the Bengal Artillery, in which corps he served for several years. Having returned to England in 1845, Mr. Kaye devoted himself for the rest of his life assiduously to literature, some zeal for which he had already shown in early life, while still in the East, having been a zealous contributor to different newspapers, and the founder of the Calcutta Review, of which he was for some time the Editor. In 1856, he entered the Home Civil Service of the East India Company, just one year before the Mutiny, and, not long after, succeeded Mr. John Stuart Mill as the head of the Political and Secret Department of the India Office Secretariat, a post he held till failing health compelled him to retire from it in 1874. Sir John Kaye\nwas the author of many works, which will long survive him, distinguished as they may be all said to be by the desire for careful research, and for arriving at a true and honest conclusion from the premisses before him.\n\nHis chief published works were: A History of the War in Afghanistan. 2 vols. 8vo. 1851.\u2014The Administration of the East India Company; a history of progress. 8vo. 1853.\u2014The Life and Correspondence of Lord Metcalfe, late Governor-General of India, Governor of Jamaica, and Governor-General of Canada. 2 vols. 8vo. 1854.\u2014The Life and Correspondence of Henry St. George Tucker, late Accountant-General of Bengal and Chairman of the East India Company. 1854.\u2014Life and Correspondence of General Sir John Malcolm. 2 vols. 1856.\u2014Christianity in India; an historical narrative. 1859; and a History of the Sepoy War of India in 1857-8; the second volume of which appeared in 1871. As this work was naturally\u2014indeed, in some places, severely\u2014criticized, it is unfortunate the writer did not live to complete his third and final volume. Writing to an old friend, about three months before his death in last July, in allusion to a criticism in the Times on this work, he says: \"I feel with you that it is a great evil so great an authority as the Times should be led so grievously astray in the path of error. I have often stated that I reserved my summing up for its proper place, in the last volume of the history; . . . . . and if God gives me life and my present clearness of brain, I will do my best to smash it. . . . Carlyle says, 'All lies have the sentence of death recorded against them from the hour of their birth,' and this must be one of our dying consolations if we do not live to see the day.\"\n\n(2). Mr. Edward W. Lane was born at Hereford in the year 1801, being the son of the Rev. Theophilus Lane, who, after serving for some time in the American War, quitted the army, and, entering holy orders, became, ultimately, a Prebendary of the Cathedral Church of Hereford.\nHaving shown at school a remarkable aptitude for mathematics, Mr. Lane was sent to Cambridge; but, after a short residence there, removed to London, to study engraving with his late brother, Mr. R. J. Lane, A.R.A. Finding, however, the confinement of this occupation injurious to his health, which was never strong, he sailed for Alexandria in 1825, some inducement to this course having, no doubt, been, the knowledge he had acquired of Arabic during the three preceding years, combined with the interest, everywhere aroused, by the then fresh discoveries of Young and Champollion. It was a fortunate thing for him that he had, already, become an adept in the use of the camera lucida, under the personal instruction of its inventor, Dr. Wollaston, as he was thus able to secure copies of the ancient monuments of Nubia and Egypt, almost as faithful as photographs, and far more pleasant to the eye. The result of Mr. Lane's three years' sojourn in Egypt on this occasion, was the acquirement of a perfect knowledge of the local dialects and the habits of the people, of many valuable maps, and of a portfolio of drawings from the Egyptian monuments exquisitely traced in sepia. These drawings have, unfortunately, never been published; but they led, indirectly, to the public recognition of his abilities as an artist; for, having been seen by some of the members of the Committee of the then young Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, Lord Brougham induced its Committee to recommend the publication of a portion of Mr. Lane's \"Notes,\" a second journey to Egypt being the first step to this, and his admirable work on the \"Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians,\" the result. During the year and a half (1833-5), which he spent, chiefly in Cairo, in perfecting a work (the popularity of which was so great that the whole of the first impression was sold off in a fortnight), Mr. Lane made the acquaintance of M. Fresnel, the greatest Arabic scholar in France since De Sacy, and discussed with him the scheme he had already meditated over, of a future Dictionary of the\nArabic Language. M. Fresnel, to his honour, joined heart and soul in Mr. Lane's plans.\n\nThe \"Manners and Customs of the Egyptians\" was published shortly after Mr. Lane's return to England, in 1836, and, since then, there have been five subsequent editions, together with a translation into German, and a reprint by Mr. Charles Knight, in 1846, in 3 vols. 12mo.\n\nMr. Lane remained in England for the following five years, chiefly engaged in the preparation of the translation of a work whereby he is probably better remembered by the English public than even by his \"Manners and Customs.\" Many of us can recollect what \"The Thousand and One Nights,\" or, as the book was more usually called, the \"Arabian Nights Entertainments,\" was like, before the year 1840. It was amusing enough, it is true; and, as such, was eagerly read by all classes; but, assuredly, it did not adequately represent the original of which it professed to be a translation. To Mr. Lane belongs the credit of enabling unlearned English people to read these quaint pictures of Eastern life in an Eastern dress. Mr. Lane, during the same period, laboured assiduously to promote the views of the Oriental Translation and Text Societies, then warmly supported by Prof. H. H. Wilson, Mr. Bland, and other English scholars.\n\nThe object of Mr. Lane's third and last visit to Egypt was the carrying out of the plan he had so long and so carefully considered,\u2014the construction of a complete Arabic-English Lexicon of the Classical Language, drawn, to use his own words, \"chiefly from the most copious Eastern sources.\" To enable him to do this, he had the active and willing aid of Algernon, Duke of Northumberland, to whose munificence, while he lived, and to that of his widow, subsequently, the payment of all costs required, not only for its publication, but for the collecting of the essential materials and for the transcriptions of the necessary MSS. at Cairo, is, in a great measure, due. To what a length these transcriptions extended will be\nbest understood when it is stated that the copy of one dictionary alone, the \"T\u00e1j-el-Aroos,\" fills twenty thick quarto volumes, and occupied more than thirteen years in its transcription and collation.\n\nAfter seven years of unremitting labour in Cairo, Mr. Lane returned to England, and, about a year subsequently, took up his abode at Worthing, where he continued to work on steadily at the Lexicon, till at length, in the year 1863, he had the satisfaction of bringing out the first volume, after twenty years of unwearied application. Since then, four other volumes have been issued from the press, at intervals of two or three years, the sixth being now nearly ready; two more volumes, it is believed, will bring this great work to a final conclusion.\n\nAn objection has been raised to the plan Mr. Lane found it compulsory on him to adopt, in that he has excluded all words formed since the classical times of the Arabic language. But a simple answer to this is, that no one book could have been made large enough to contain them all; while many, especially those of the latter class, are already incorporated in other dictionaries, or have been explained in the numerous translations and commentaries published by various editors of Arabic texts.\n\nMr. Lane was a Corresponding Member of the Institute of France, an Honorary Member of the Royal Society of Literature and of the German Oriental Society, and an Honorary Doctor in Literature of the University of Leiden.\n\n(3). Besides Mr. Lane, Orientalists have, also, to mourn the loss of another great scholar, whose influence over a large number of Sanskrit pupils and scholars was very widely felt. Prof. H. Brockhaus, who died at the close of last year, at the age of 71, was born at Amsterdam in 1806, and the son of F. A. Brockhaus, the founder of the eminent publishing house of that name at Leipzig. Early in life he devoted himself to the pursuit of Oriental literature, studying in the Universities of Leipzig, G\u00f6ttingen, and Bonn, and, subsequently, spending\nsome time in the thorough examination of the Oriental libraries of Copenhagen, Paris, London, and Oxford. As a Professor of Oriental Languages, he commenced his career at Jena in 1839, as \"Professor Extraordinarius;\" settling, however, two years later, at Leipzig, where, in 1848, he was appointed \"Professor Ordinarius\" of Indian Languages and Literature. Prof. Brockhaus lectured chiefly upon Sanskrit; but there were scarcely any Eastern tongues of which he had not acquired considerable knowledge. Thus he is known to have studied Hebrew, Arabic, and Persian, and, though, in after days, Sanskrit may fairly be considered to have been his specialit\u00e9, he occasionally lectured on Pali, Zend, and even on Chinese.\n\nThe principal work Professor Brockhaus published was the \"editio princeps\" of the Katha-sarit-sagara (with a translation in German)\u2014Leipzig, 1839\u20131866\u2014being the large collection of stories in Sanskrit, collected together by Soma Deva in the twelfth century, a work which gave the first scientific impulse to the study and investigation of the origin of Popular Tales, and thus enabled Prof Benfey and others to trace back a large proportion of Eastern and Western stories to an original Indian source. Some of the episodes of this great work have been, from time to time, published separately. Prof. Brockhaus also edited the Prabodha-chandrodaya, a comedy by Krishna Mitra (1834\u201345), and issued a treatise, \"Uber der druck der Sanskritischen werke mit Lateinischen Buchstaben\" (1841), in which form the Ghakurpara, the Mahamadgara, and other pieces were printed. Besides these purely Sanskrit works, Prof. Brockhaus gave to the world an edition, the first generally accessible, of the Vendidad Sade, in Roman characters, with a valuable Index and Glossary (1850); a critical edition of Haft, with Sadi's commentary (1854\u201361); and of Nachshebi's Persian recension of the \"Seven Wise Masters\" (1845).\n\nProf. Brockhaus was one of the founders of the \"Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl\u00e4ndischen Gesellschaft,\" and its chief\neditor since 1852. He also started, in 1857, the \"Abhandlungen\" to this valuable periodical, of which five volumes have already been printed. In this Journal, as well as in the \"Berichte der Sachsischen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften,\" many original communications from him have been preserved. It may be fairly said that it has been mainly owing to the energy and judgment of Professors Brockhaus and Curtius, that Leipzig has become the first Philological School in Germany.\n\n(4). Prof. Childers, who, to the irreparable loss of one great branch of Oriental learning, died last July, at the premature age of thirty-eight years, was the son of the Rev. Charles Childers, for many years the English Chaplain at Nice. After having passed a short time at Wadham College, Oxford, where he obtained a Hebrew Scholarship, he proceeded to Ceylon in 1860, before he had taken his degree; but, after acting, for three years, as private secretary to Sir Charles McCarthy, the Governor of that Island, was compelled by ill health to return to England in 1864. The same weakness of constitution, for some years, compelled him to relinquish his studies in Pali, in which he had already made great progress under the able guidance of Y\u0101tr\u0101mulle Unnanse, a Buddhist scholar of the highest character. By the advice and encouragement of Dr. Rost he was, however, induced to take up again, in 1868, the earnest study of that language\u2014so that he was able, in November, 1869, to publish in the Journal of this Society his first contribution to Pali literature, the text of Khaddaka P\u0101tha, with an English translation and notes. This paper was read before this Society on February 15th, 1869.\n\nWith the exception of Mr. Fausb\u00f6ll's Dhammapada, the collection of Buddhist hymns thus published by Mr. Childers was the only portion of the Buddhist pi\u1e6dakas, up to this period, actually printed in Europe\u2014the great obstacle to a real knowledge of Pali being the want of an adequate dictionary: this\nwant Prof. Childers at once set to work to remedy, his first volume being published in 1872, and the work itself finally completed in 1873, scarcely a year before death closed his career of usefulness. In the interval, however, he published his views on Nirvana, first in Tr\u00fcbner's Literary Record in 1870, and afterwards in the Journal of this Society in May, 1871, under the title of Notes on the Dhammapada, completing and summing up the discussion in the long article on Nibbana at the close of vol. i. of his Dictionary. In the autumn of 1872 Prof. Childers was appointed Sub-Librarian at the India Office.\n\nIn 1873, Mr. Childers contributed a paper \"On Buddhist Metaphysics\" to Prof. Cowell's edition of H. T. Colebrooke's Essays, and commenced a series of papers in the Journal of this Society \"On the Sinhalese Language.\" In the same year, he accepted the appointment of Professor of Pali and Buddhist Literature at University College, London, being the first Professor appointed specially for this subject.\n\nIn 1874, was published the first part of his edition of the Mah\u0101-parinibb\u0101na Sutta, that portion of the Sutta Pitaka which gives an account of the last few days of the life of Gautama Buddha; and, in 1875, appeared his second paper on Sinhalese, in which this language is conclusively proved to be of Sanskritic and not of Dravidian origin.\n\nEarly in 1876, soon after the completion of his Dictionary, Prof. Childers issued the second part of the Mah\u0101-parinibb\u0101na Sutta; having, at the same time, undertaken, with Mr. Faussboll, of Copenhagen, a complete edition of the Buddhist Jataka stories, together with translations from the Pitaka, for Prof. Max Muller's projected series of Translations from the Sacred Literature of the East. He was also working, assiduously, towards the completion of his previously announced Pali Grammar, when rapid consumption, following upon an attack of cold, in the earlier part of the year, carried him off on July 26th, 1876. It should be added, that just before his death,\nhe received the gratifying intelligence that the French Institute had awarded to him the Volney Prize for 1876.\n\n(5). Dr. Martin Haug, one of the most eminent of recent Oriental scholars, was born on January 30, 1827, at Balingen, in Wurtemberg, and died, from the effect of sleeping in a damp cold room, at Raga, on June 5, 1876, having not quite completed his fiftieth year. The child of humble parents, it was long before Dr. Haug's intellectual powers had fair chance, although, at more than one small school in which he was a pupil, the masters had detected the germ of the abilities he subsequently exhibited. He was, in his earliest youth, employed on his father's farm. In 1843, he took the place of a sick master of the school at Balingen, whereby he acquired a further knowledge of the Classical languages, and was, at the same time, able to purchase some books. Somewhat later, in the same year, he became an assistant in another school, with 100 children to teach, and the moderate payment of 120 thalers (about \u00a318) as his annual salary. In 1844, he commenced the study of Sanskrit, but under considerable difficulties, as he could not, for some time, obtain a Sanskrit grammar; he had, therefore, to teach himself the alphabet by the laborious comparison with the original Sanskrit of the proper names he found in Bopp's Latin translation of the Nalas and Damajanti. Still he went on, steadily, having clearly in view the then main object of his life, University distinction. In the end, by the aid of a friend, he obtained the free use of the University Library at Stuttgart, about the same time acquiring from Creuzer's \"Symbolik\" his first glimpses of the Vedas and of the Zend-Avesta. In 1848, he entered the University of Stuttgart, where he soon took a leading place among the students; going, however, not long after, to Tubingen, where he obtained a sound knowledge of the Classical languages, and obtained the prize for an essay (subsequently published), the subject being the authorities whence Plutarch gathered materials for\nhis \"Lives.\" Not long after, we find him studying the connexion of the Classical languages of Antiquity with those of the East, and working with the greatest energy at Sanskrit, Zend and modern Persian, under Prof. Rudolph Roth, who had succeeded Prof. Ewald. He suffered, however, at this period, much from privation, as his father could not or would not give him any help; he had, therefore, during the winter of 1849-50, to eke out a precarious existence by the private teaching of Hebrew. In 1851, he took the degree of Doctor in Philosophy, and shortly afterwards attended, at G\u00f6ttingen, the lectures of Professors K. F. Hermann, Benfey and Ewald. To the last named, indeed, he was especially indebted, for private lessons in Arabic, Persian, Turkish and Armenian. From G\u00f6ttingen he went to Bonn, where he was warmly welcomed by Lassen, and, while there, gave himself up to the study of Zend, six years' subsequent continuous study serving to place him in the very first rank of Zend and Iranian scholars.\n\nIn 1858, Baron Bunsen offered him the post of his private secretary and fellow-worker at Heidelberg, in the \"Bibelwerke,\" and, through his instrumentality, he was enabled to visit Paris, London and Oxford, and, in the summer of the following year, he secured (mainly through the recommendation of his friends in Oxford) the appointment of Professor of Sanskrit and Superintendent of Sanskrit studies at Poona. How laboriously he worked, and what good work he did in the furtherance of Oriental learning during the seven years he remained in India, is well enough known. Shortly after his return to Europe, he accepted the post of Professor of Sanskrit and Comparative Languages at Munich, where his lectures had a great success and were attended by a large number of students. At the second Congress of Orientalists in London, in September, 1874, Prof. Haug occupied a prominent place. Few, who then rejoiced in seeing him again, anticipated the early death which has so suddenly terminated his career of usefulness.\nProf. Haug, during his residence in the East, made good use of the unrivalled opportunities he enjoyed of making a collection of Oriental MSS. connected with those branches of study to which he had paid the chief attention. On his return to Europe he kept these by him, declining to part with them except as a whole. From the Catalogue published since his death it appears that they consist of 34 in Zend, Pehlevi, Pazend and Persian, and 304 in Sanskrit, these latter being almost exclusively Vedic. Among these is a very fine copy of the Brihad-devat\u0101. This noble collection has been now secured for the Royal Library at Munich.\n\nDr. Haug was a volumineous writer, as the following list, probably by no means an exhaustive one, sufficiently indicates:\n\n\u00dcber die Pehlewi-sprache und den Bundehesch.

That the copy presented by Sir Walter Elliot to the Madras Literary Society is now in the hands of M. Oppert, at Madras, who has expressed his willingness to return it, when required.\n\n2. That Sir Walter Elliot's own copy of these Inscriptions was taken out to Bombay, during last autumn (1875), by Mr. Burgess, and entrusted by him to Mr. Fleet, of the Bombay Civil Service, the person, in India, most competent to make a good use of it.\n\nThey considered, therefore, that, as there were already two copies in India, available for the purposes alluded to in this letter, it was not advisable to send thither, also, the only remaining copy of such valuable records.\n\nA second letter was, subsequently, sent to the Secretary of State for India in Council, wherein his attention was drawn to the existence of a large number of fac-similes of copper-plate grants\u2014obtained by rubbings or impressions in paper\u2014many of which, being in private hands, it might be difficult to obtain again\u2014and, at the same time, asking him to reconsider the conclusion he had arrived at on a former occasion, and to\nsanction the expenditure of a sum, not exceeding \u00a3200, for the publication in fac-simile of a selection from the volume of Canarese Inscriptions in the possession of the Society, as, if this were not done, the editing of the rubbings, now in India, would be altogether incomplete. This request was not directly acceded to, but an arrangement was subsequently made with Mr. Burgess, who undertook to publish the whole of them in the Indian Antiquary, in consideration of the Government grant to that publication being continued for two years beyond the time originally agreed upon, and on a slightly extended scale.\n\nAt a subsequent meeting, a letter was addressed by the Council to the Secretary of State for India, calling his attention to the proposed new and complete edition of Tabari, which has been undertaken in Germany under the general editorship of Prof. de Goeje of Leiden. In this letter the Council expressed their hope that he would give Prof. de Goeje some assistance in an undertaking, which they considered specially entitled to the recognition of the Government of India. To this request the Council have great pleasure in stating that the Secretary of State for India has assented, by granting the sum of \u00a3100 towards this edition of Tabari.\n\nIt having come under the knowledge of the Council, that there was a proposition for the erecting a Joint Colonial and Indian Museum on the Thames Embankment, a sub-committee of your Council attended a Meeting at the Cannon Street Hotel, and heard this proposition duly and fully advocated by Dr. Forbes Watson. The conclusion, however, at which your Council arrived, after some correspondence on both sides, was, that it was not expedient, at present, to take any steps towards promoting a subscription for the purchase of the proposed site.\n\nThe Council had, also, received information through a letter from the Secretary of the Metropolitan Board of Works, addressed to their President, Sir Edward Colebrooke, that the\nMetropolitan Board held themselves unable, under the provisions of the Thames Embankment Land Act of 1873, to relinquish their right to the roadway or terrace garden which is to be maintained between the buildings to be erected on the Crown land and the public garden.\n\nA considerable addition to the number of the Honorary Members of the Society having been suggested, a sub-committee, with Sir Rutherford Alcock, K.C.B., as Chairman, was appointed to consider the whole question. This sub-committee met, and came to the following conclusions:\n\n1. That the number of Honorary Members should, in future, be limited; and\n2. That the whole number of Honorary Members should not exceed thirty.\n\nAnd, as it was observed that, at the present time, the number of Honorary Members amounted to thirty-one, it became clear that no further addition could now be made to this list.\n\nThe Council further determined, that, in future, Members of the Bengal Asiatic Society and of other Branches of this Society, should be admitted as Members, without ballot, on paying an Annual Subscription of Two Guineas.\n\nThe following Papers have been read at different General Meetings of the Society during the last year:\n\n1.

As the balance at the bankers is practically the same as when they made their last Report, and as there are no outstanding liabilities, the financial position of the Society remains unaltered. They have, also, formed a careful estimate of the probable receipts and expenditure for the current year, and see no reason for doubting that the income will suffice for all the ordinary expenses of the Society, even after allowing a slight increase in the expenditure on the Journal which they consider most desirable.\n## Abstract of Receipts and Expenditure for the Year 1876\n\n### Receipts\n\n| Description                                                                 | Amount |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Balance at Bankers', January 1, 1876                                       | \u00a324 5 s 1 d |\n| 105 Resident Members                                                        | \u00a324 0 s 0 d |\n| 40 Non-Resident Members                                                    | \u00a32 0 s 0 d |\n| Arrived April 1st                                                          | \u00a33 0 s 0 d |\n| Resident                                                                  | \u00a318 16 s 0 d |\n| Non-Resident                                                               | \u00a318 16 s 0 d |\n| Composition Fee                                                            | \u00a31 10 s 0 d |\n| Non-Resident                                                               | \u00a319 19 s 0 d |\n| Donation from Council for India                                            | \u00a3210 0 s 0 d |\n| Dividend on Consols, \u00a3700                                                  | \u00a330 15 s 0 d |\n| Rent                                                                         | \u00a37 15 s 0 d |\n| Total Receipts                                                             | \u00a3968 15 s 0 d |\n| Balance in Treasurer's hands, Jan. 1, 1876                                  | \u00a320 0 s 0 d |\n\n### Expenditure\n\n| Description                                                                 | Amount |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| House Rent for the Year                                                     | \u00a320 0 s 0 d |\n| Water Rate for the Half-year                                                | \u00a310 10 s 10 d |\n| Fire Insurance (ditto)                                                      | \u00a36 0 s 0 d |\n| Salaries\u2014Secretary                                                         | \u00a318 0 s 0 d |\n| Clerk (ditto)                                                               | \u00a36 0 s 0 d |\n| Bedford (pension)                                                           | \u00a32 0 s 0 d |\n| Alliances\u2014Royal Asiatic Society                                             | \u00a320 0 s 0 d |\n| University of Cambridge (3 quarters)                                        | \u00a312 10 s 0 d |\n| University of London (3 quarters)                                           | \u00a32 10 s 0 d |\n| Journal\u2014Trimmer (Vol. VIII.

E. BAILLIE, Auditors for the Society,\nE. L. BRANDRETH, JAS. FERGUSON, Auditor for the Council.\nProceedings of Asiatic Societies.\u2014Royal Asiatic Society.\u2014The Journal of the Society, Vol. IX. Part I. contains papers by Mr. Thomas, F.R.S., \"On Bactrian Coins and Indian Dates\"; by Mr. Sayce, on \"The Tenses of the Assyrian Verb\"; by the late R. Friederich, \"An Account of the Island of Bali,\" continued from the previous volume; by Major Mockler, on \"On Ruins in Makr\u00e1n\"; by Mr. Stanley L. Poole, on \"Inedited Arabic Coins,\" Part 3; by Prof. Dowson, \"On a Bactrian Pali Inscription and the Samvat Era\"; and by Mr. A. H. Schindler, \"Notes on Persian Beluchist\u00e1n, being a Report to the Government of Persia, drawn up by Mirza Mehdy Kh\u00e1n.\" In his paper Mr. Thomas examines very fully the question of the dates recognizable on some of the Bactrian coins, and shows that the rulers of that country were in the habit of recognizing and of employing curtailed dates, by the omission (at will) of the figures for the hundreds; and further, that this seems to have been an immemorial custom in many parts of India. An Inscription of the ninth century, from Kashmir, shows clearly the provincial use of a cycle of one hundred years, while Dr. B\u00fchler has proved that the same practice is followed even now. In his paper on \"The Tenses of the Assyrian Verb,\" Mr. Sayce points out the value of the knowledge of Assyrian to the Semitic student, in that we have records in it ascending far beyond those of any other Semitic dialect, the conclusion being that, owing to its early development as a literary dialect, Assyrian changed very slightly during a period of fully 2000 years; and, further, that while the syllabic character of the writing has preserved the vowels exactly as they were pronounced, the monuments, themselves, were also inscribed, while the speech of the people was still a living one, and not, as might otherwise have been the case, handed down to us through the doubtful channels of tradition and copyists. Major Mockler, in his paper \"On Ruins in Makr\u00e1n,\" has given a careful narrative of his examination of ancient dwellings and tombs at two places, respectively,\nnamed Sutkagen Dor and Dambakoh, near Guadar, in Beluchist\u00e1n. These places are not far from the coast of Makr\u00e1n, and the first exhibits remains of many ancient works, and, especially, of two dykes of large stones joining adjacent hills with the local name of \"Bahrami.\" Here were found a number of oblong stone inclosures, with a quantity of pottery, charcoal, fish-bones, and flint knives. At the second place, Dambakoh, \"the hill of Dambs or cairns,\" are a great number of little inclosures, eight or nine feet square at the base, and having a single door; pottery, beads, etc., and a Parthian coin were found during the excavations. Major Mockler's paper was accompanied with numerous drawings, from which it has been only possible to select those on the single plate accompanying the impression of his paper in the Journal of the Society.\n\nIn a note \"On a Bactrian Pali Inscription and the Samvat Era,\" Prof. Dowson maintains his previous reading of the contested word \"Samvatsarasa,\" and holds that it must be understood as meaning the \"Samvatsara\" of Vikramaditya, till the contrary is shown. Mr. A. H. Schindler gives some interesting notes (read at one of the General Meetings of last year) \"On Persian Beluchist\u00e1n,\" drawn up by a native Persian Officer, Mirza Mehdy Kh\u00e1n.\n\nVol. IX. Part II. contains papers by Mr. Thomas, F.R.S., \"On the Early Faith of Asoka;\" by Mr. H. H. Howorth, \"On the Northern Frontagers of China. Part II. The Manchus (Supplementary Notice);\" and \"On the Kin or Golden Tatars,\" being a continuation of the series of his papers \"On the Northern Frontagers of China;\" by M. Sauvaire, on a discovery by the Baron McGuckin De Slane, among the Oriental MSS. of the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale at Paris, of a Treatise on Weights and Measures, by Eliya, Archbishop of Nisibin, who died A.D. 1049; by Sir E. T. Colebrooke, \"On Imperial and other Titles;\" by Capt. C. J. F. Forbes, \"On the Affinities of the Dialects of the Chepang and\nKusundah Tribes of Nip\u00e1l with the Hill Tribes of Arracan;\" and by Mr. A. H. Schindler, \"On Antiquities found at Tepeh-i Hissar, near Damghan in Persia.\"\n\nIn his paper \"On the Early Faith of A\u1e63oka,\" Mr. Thomas reviews at some length, and with a full examination of the various authorities connected with this subject, the opinions that have, from time to time, been held by the most eminent Oriental scholars; at the same time, expressing his final judgment, that there had been too great haste in assuming A\u1e63oka to have been a Buddhist, as he could hardly have been considered an energetic advocate of Buddhism till a comparatively late period of his life. In the course of his argument, Mr. Thomas urged that many distinguished students of Indian Antiquities, as Mr. J. W. Traill, Captain Low, and Dr. Stevenson\u2014nay, even Mr. Brian H. Hodgson, and the late Professor H. H. Wilson\u2014had, practically, admitted, that much usually called Buddhism, was, in real truth, a remnant of the probably earlier system of the Jainas: Mr. Colebrooke, indeed, he thought, had gone even further than this, when he suggested that Buddhism might perhaps be an emanation of Jainism. Mr. Thomas then stated his opinion that the inscribed and still existing edicts of A\u1e63oka clearly exhibit three distinct phases of belief: (1) When he was a follower of the Jaina system; (2) When his views were becoming modified; and (3) When, towards the close of his life, he had clearly become an out-spoken Buddhist. Mr. Thomas, further, pointed out that, in his judgment, evidence could be adduced for the antiquity of the Jaina faith, even from Brahmanical sources, and quoted the words of the recent traveller, M. Rousselet, with reference to documents still in the possession of the Jainas, and of which he was, personally, cognizant. Mr. Thomas added some curious evidence as to the concurrent state and retarded progress of Brahmanism, from the Numismatic evidence of a race whose rulers governed a considerable portion of Central Asia, from about B.C. 100 to 200 A.D., viz. the\nIndo-Scythians. On the gold coins of this people, we find no less than six sets of Gods, in contemporary use, with the additional evidence afforded by their very curious and remarkable types, that, at that period, Brahmanism had not, as yet, emerged from Saivism.\n\nMr. Howorth, in his paper, \"On the Kin or Golden Tatars,\" gave a valuable notice of the gradual rise and progress of the Yuchis, and of the circumstances that led to their successful conquest and occupation of Northern China, during the eleventh century A.D., then under the feeble dynasty of the Khitan or Liau Dynasty. Sketches of the lives of many of the Yuchi chiefs were given, with a somewhat more enlarged biography of Aguta, who raised his people from the position of a petty principality in Manchuria, to great importance among the Northern Asiatic powers. Aguta died in A.D. 1123, at the age of fifty-five years, leaving, as the result of his prowess, an empire of short duration, indeed, but having for its capital the present Pekin.\n\nM. Sauvaire, in his account of Archbishop Eliy\u00e1's Essay, shows clearly that, though imperfect, it contains much matter of interest to those who pursue Numismatic studies, and that it would be worth while to compare his statements with those of Makrizi.\n\nCapt. C. J. F. Forbes, in his paper on the \"Affinities of the Dialects of the Chepang and Kusundah Tribes of Nip\u00e1l with those of the Hill Tribes of Arracan,\" supported and confirmed the views advanced forty years ago by Mr. B. H. Hodgson.\n\nThe sketch of the history of \"Imperial and other Titles,\" which forms the subject of the last paper but two in the forthcoming number of our Journal, arose out of the late discussions in Parliament, on the proposed assumption by Her Majesty of a new title, to be borne in India only.\n\nMuch was said at the time of the inappropriateness, or the contrary, of the title of Emperor, as the equivalent of those usually borne by the sovereigns of extensive dominions in\nthe East, especially in India; and is seemed of interest, independently of the political questions involved in this measure, to trace the history of the titles, which have been current in the East, at different times and in different States, and to compare their political significance with those of Europe. In following out this idea, Sir Edward Colebrooke has traced the History of Imperial titles from the time of the Roman Republic, through the various changes it underwent in the Lower Empire and in modern Europe, and, after this preliminary review, it has been his aim to apply a similar process to the various Royal and other titles, which have been in general use among Eastern dynasties. In this way the titles Mahr, Sultan, Khan, Shah and Padshah, as well as those of Khaliq and Amir, and the Hindu title Raja and its compounds, were passed in review, the paper concluding with some remarks on the fluctuating and ephemeral character of such designations, with the view of impressing on the translators of Eastern narratives, the expediency of letting the reader know the exact designation borne by Eastern Princes, at particular epochs, and the significance which attached to them at the time.\n\nAt the Society of Arts.\u2014Asiatic Society of Bengal.\u2014The Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal has published two valuable memoirs. The first, by Capt. C. H. Marsh, being \"A Description of a Trip to the Gilgit Valley, a dependency of the Maharaja of Kashmir;\" and the second, by R. B. Shaw, Esq., \"On the Gujratian Languages\u2014Wakh and Sarikoli.\" In the first Capt. Marsh gives an interesting account of a journey he made from Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir, through a district which has been scarcely at all visited, passing through a little-known path in the mountains 15,000 feet high, and called by the natives \"Sheo shan,\" or \"Bone-shining.\" This pass, called also \"Mareena,\" is only open in September and October, and is little used.\nIn the second, Mr. R. B. Shaw gives a valuable contribution to the linguistic knowledge of the tribes to the north and north-west of the Himalayas, the dialects described and discussed being those of the populations who live in the valleys descending, respectively, to the east and the west of the great Pamir plateau.\n\nThese dialects, which are all clearly akin one with the other, are classed by their Turki neighbours under the generic name of Ghalehah, the majority of the population being Shiah Muslims, speaking a more or less pure Persian. The Tajiks of the plain, Mr. Shaw adds, speak their own form of Persian, differing, as this does, merely in pronunciation and in a few other peculiarities. In the more secluded valleys are certain other tribes, especially to the south and east of Badakhshan, who are, unquestionably, Aryan by race, and of the Persic branch. It is certain, however, that these dialects are not mere offshoots or corruptions of modern Persian, though there may be plenty of modern Persian words in their usual vocabulary; history, however, tells us nothing either of their arrival in their present seats, or whence they came.\n\nBombay Branch.\u2014The Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society has continued its useful labours, and has published many papers equally valuable and interesting. Among these we may specify Dr. B\u00fchl\u00e9r\u2019s \u201cAdditional Remarks on the Age of the Naishadhiya\u201d; Mr. Gerson da Cunha\u2019s \u201cHistorical and Archaeological Sketch of the Island of Angediva\u201d; Rao Saheb Mandlik\u2019s transcript and explanation of three Walabhi Copper Plates, with many ingenious and able remarks on them; Mr. Fleet\u2019s \u201cSanskrit and Old Canarese Inscriptions relating to the Yadava Kings of Devagiri\u201d; Mr. Da Cunha\u2019s \u201cNotes on the History and Antiquities of Chaul\u201d; and Dr. Marchesetti\u2019s paper \u201cOn a Pre-historic Monument on the Western Coast of India.\u201d\nIn the first, Dr. B\u00fchler points out that there is no doubt that Sriharsha, the author of the Naishadhya Mah\u00e1 K\u00e1rya, lived at the Court of a King, Jayantachandra, who ruled Benares; that this King is really Jayachandra, the last of the R\u00e1htor princes of Kanoj, who, after ruling at Benares, was dethroned by the Musulmans in 1195 A.D.; that Sriharsha himself states, that he was highly honoured by a King of K\u00e1nyakubja, or K\u00e1noj; and, further, that Rajasekhara affirms that the first copy of his work was brought to Gujarat about 1235 A.D., by Harihara, during the reign of R\u00e1n\u00e1 Viradha\u00faala. Dr. B\u00fchler then notices the objections which had been urged against his view by Mr. Fitz-Edward Hall and his friend Mr. Telang, together with the support he had received from other scholars.\n\nIn Mr. Da Cunha\u2019s historical account of Angediva we have an interesting memoir of a place, which, besides its ancient interest, has the more modern one of being the scene of Camoens\u2019 \u201cfloating Island of Venus,\u201d where Vasco da Gama, on his first homeward voyage, re-fitted his ships and supplied them with wood and water; and where, too, Don Francisco d\u2019Almeida built a fortress, the ruins of which are still to be seen. There has been much doubt as to the meaning and derivation of the name Angediva, but Mr. Da Cunha thinks it is probably derived from Aj\u00e1deipa, the \u201cIsland of the Goddess Aj\u00e1.\u201d It seems, also, probable that it is at or near the Louk of the Greeks, the place, in fact, where their merchant ships used to meet before proceeding along the more fertile shores of Limar\u00edki (Canara and Malabar). In a second paper, entitled \u201cNotes on the History and Antiquities of Chaul,\u201d Mr. Da Cunha has traced, with equal skill, the remarkable story of this ancient site, on the mainland of North Konk\u00e1n, about thirty miles south-east of Bombay. It is well known that Chaul was, for some centuries, one of the chief commercial estreps of Western India, having been noticed so early as the Peripius, under the name of Simylla according to Colonel\nYule, the *Chin\u00e1do* of Hiuen Tsang), and subsequently by Masudi, Ibn Haukal, Al-Biruni, Zakariya Al-Kazwini, and most of the best known early European travellers from Cosmas Indicopleustes to Varthema, Da Gama, and Niebuhr. No doubt, to ordinary readers, the most interesting portion of the History of China was during the period it was the chief stronghold of the Portuguese; but the details of the deeds of Vasco da Gama, Don Francisco D\u2019Almeida, and of his son Don Louren\u00e7o, are already sufficiently well known. Mr. Da Cunha gives a clear and impartial account of them.\n\n*Asiatic Society of Japan.*\u2014The Transactions of this Society are, perhaps, not unnaturally, restricted almost entirely to matters of immediate interest to those who live in Japan, and are, therefore, of less general interest to the general body of Oriental scholars. There is, however, in them an excellent antiquarian paper by a native Japanese writer, \u201cOn some ancient Copper Bells,\u201d from which, it appears, curiously enough, that these objects have been invariably dug up, and have never as we might, otherwise, have expected, been handed down in families. There is also a pleasant account of a visit by Mr. R. H. Brunton to \u201cOkinawa Shiba and the Loochoo Islands,\u201d with a notice of \u201cThe Bonin Islands,\u201d by Russell Robertson, Esq., and a \u201cNote of a Trip from Yedo to Kioto,\u201d by Prof. D. H. Marshall. Each of these papers will well repay general perusal.\n\nIn the *China Review*, vol. v. part ii., Mr. Watters continues his valuable essays on the Chinese language, the present portion of his work being intended to show to how great an extent \u201csuggestive or imitative gestures and other purely facial expressions act for or assist articulate speech among the Chinese.\u201d All classes, Mr. Watters states, use such gestures, and not merely the lower ones: he has, however, space to mention only a few of the more remarkable among them.\n\nIn vol. v. part iv., for the present year, the article above\nalluded to by Mr. Watters is continued, and many other interesting subjects are treated of with skill and knowledge. *Inter alia* there is a curious notice of a \"Chinese Horn-book,\" showing how young people receive their first education in China, and an excellent review of Dr. Eitel's Dictionary of the Cantonese Dialect, which has at present reached from A to K, which proves, satisfactorily, how great have been the advances in Chinese lexicography in recent times, and especially during the last seven years.\n\nIn the same part Mr. Dennys concludes his useful series of papers on the \"Folk-lore of China,\" comprehending in this section of his work \"Fables and Proverbial Lore,\" it being, however, a curious fact that Chinese literature hardly possesses any collections of Fables properly so called, though they have a great abundance of isolated tales. The only known collections of fables are translations from Sanskrit and Buddhistic sources, and, therefore, exotic to pure Chinese thought. The fact seems to be that the Government is afraid of stories in which its faults appear to be lashed; hence, the speedy suppression by the Mandarins of a translation of \u00c6sop's fables by Mr. Thorn in 1837-8, though a work, generally, accepted with favour by the populace.\n\nDr. Bretschneider continues his valuable articles \"On the Chinese Intercourse with the Countries of Central and Western Asia in the Fifteenth Century,\" the details of which, however, it is not possible to follow out here; and the part concludes with a brief but useful notice of the works most recently published bearing on the general history of China, and of the nations more or less connected with her.\n\n*Journal Asiatique.*\u2014Tome viii. part i. July, 1876, is entirely occupied by a report on the progress of Oriental matters during the years 1875\u20136, drawn up by M. Renan, the worthy successor, in this respect, of the late Jules Mohl; and a considerable portion, parts ii. and iii., is devoted to\nM. Guyard's able and ingenious paper, entitled \"Th\u00e9orie nouvelle de la Metrique Arabe,\" which has since been published separately. M. Philip Berger contributes a notice \"Sur les pierres sacr\u00e9es appel\u00e9es en Ph\u00e9nicien Ne\u00e7ib Mal\u00e6 Baal,\" somewhat differing views about which have been published by Gesenius, Euting, Derenbourg, and other Phoenician scholars; and M. Renan gives a photograph and a description of an early Hebrew inscription found by M. Gu\u00e9rin in the village of Alma, in Upper Galilee. M. Huart, in the third part, contributes a paper in which he reviews the later period of the Il-Khanian or Jelairide Dynasty, who reigned in Irak-Arabi between A.H. 737 and 835, and sketches the strange and varied adventures of Prince Ahmed, who, having been dispossessed of his dominions by Timur, fell, subsequently, in battle with the Turkomans of the Black Sheep. M. Clermont Ganneau adds a short notice, in which he points out the falseness of a Phoenician gem in the Imperial Cabinet at Vienna.\n\nPart iv. contains a valuable historical paper by M. Belin on the diplomatic relations between the Republic of Venice and Turkey, commencing from A.D. 1406; one by M. Zotenberg, \"Sur les sentences symboliques de Theodore Patriarche d'Antioch,\" with the Syriac text and translation; a short note by M. Senart, \"Sur quelques termes Bouddhiques;\" and one by M. C. de Harlez on the meaning of the words \"Avesta-Zend.\"\n\nGerman Oriental Society.\u2014The Journal of the German Oriental Society contains in the first two numbers of its thirtieth volume many valuable papers bearing upon Asiatic studies, such as (1) a short one on the language of the ancient Medes by M. Oppert; (2) by Hubschmann, on the pronunciation of the ancient Armenian language; (3) by Gardthausen, on the Greek origin of the Armenian alphabet; (4) by J. A. J\u00e4schke, an explanation of Tibetan words and\nnames in the work published by the Abb\u00e9 Des Godins entitled, \"La Mission de Thibet, 1855-70\"; (5) by Hubschmann, on the Iran-Armenian names ending in Karta, Kart, and Gird; and (6) by H. Jacobi, \"On some points of Indian Chronology.\" There are, also, excellent papers \"On the Himyaritic Inscriptions\" by Mordtmann and David H. M\u00fcller, and on Phoenician inscriptions by Julius Euting.\n\nIn the third part there is a notice of the translation of the Vendidad into Gujarati, by C. de Harlez, and of a syllabic dictionary of the Chinese language by Mr. Williams Wells, together with a notice of Japanese Astrology by M. Severini. In the fourth part we find an able and learned paper by Dr. Ernest Haas \"On the origin of Indian medicine, especially in connexion with Susruta.\"\n\nSome of the more important of these papers will be noticed under the subjects to which they more especially refer.\n\nArchaeology.\u2014There is comparatively little to record this year under this head, the more so that no official advices have been received from Gen. Cunningham since the appearance of his fifth volume of Reports in 1875. The public have, in consequence, no means of knowing how he has been employed during the last two years, nor what may have been the result of his researches. It is understood, however, that, during the last cold weather, he revisited Sanchi and various localities in that neighbourhood, for the purpose of investigating a large group of temples which were photographed by Lieut. Waterhouse in 1862-65. These he has found so interesting, and so complete, that he proposes to publish a folio volume of photographs of them under the title of the \"Gupta Style of Architecture,\" as he has ascertained from inscriptions on them that the principal examples belong to that dynasty. If we may assume Mr. Fergusson's dates for that dynasty to be correct, these temples would belong to the fifth century of our era, a date fully confirmed by their style of architecture, if the pro-\ngressive development of forms and details advocated by that writer can be sustained. The Council also learn with satisfaction that General Cunningham has completed his description of his great discovery of the Bharhut Tope, and that his volume of the Asoka inscriptions is nearly ready for publication.\n\nSeveral Archaeological works have been, however, published, of some of which a brief notice must be given here. In the first place, Mr. Burgess has completed the second yearly report of the Archaeological Survey and Exploration of Western India, and his work, describing these results, was published by the India Office, towards the close of the last year. It will be remembered that Mr. Burgess's previous researches were chiefly devoted to the Kanarese districts, to the caves of Badami and Aihole, and to the Jaina temples of Belgaum and Pattadkal; the means placed at his disposal being, however, unfortunately, wholly inadequate to the work expected from him. Still the result of those researches has been the opening out of a new phase of the architectural history of India from the sixth to the eighth or ninth century A.D. His present volume is chiefly devoted to \"Ahmadabad and the antiquities of Kathiawad and Kachh (Cutch),\" but contains, also, a mass of miscellaneous matter collected, more or less, during his Archaeological Survey of Western India, between Oct. 1874 and April 1875. Mr. Burgess is, thus, able to include the description of many caves in the neighbourhood of Junagadh, at Sana, Dhank, Siddhasar, etc., and to give, also, the inscriptions from the gate of the Jaina temple at Girnar, with some notices of the five temples at Gunti and at Jhinjuwada in Gujarat. The most important portion of the volume is devoted to a new and very complete description of the fourteen Edicts of Asoka, on the rock near Junagadh, which seem to have been first noticed by Major Tod in 1822, deciphered partially by J. Prinsep in 1837, and far more carefully copied by M. Westergaard and Captain, now Lieut.-Gen. Sir G. Le\nGrand Jacob in 1842. Mr. Burgess has, at length, succeeded in making perfect facsimiles of these edicts by means of paper impressions, the originals of which are now deposited in the India Office Library, and available, therefore, for scientific study and comparison. Mr. Burgess commences his new volume with a valuable monograph by Mr. Thomas \"On the S\u0101h Dynasty,\" including, as this does, a notice of the coins of the Guptas, some ingenious speculations as to the influence of the Greek language in India, a notice of some curious Indo-Parthian coins preserved at St. Petersburg, together with others of the Arabs in Sind. Besides the A\u1e63oka Inscriptions, Mr. Burgess gives copies from photographs of a S\u0101h Inscription, and of one of a Skanda Gupta, who is believed to have reigned between A.D. 450-470, both of which are inscribed on the same rock with those of A\u1e63oka. This second volume of the Archaeological Survey of Western India is admirably got up, as regards the printing, the photographs, and the copies of the impressed paper inscriptions; the map, however, of Kathiawad, Kachh, etc., is scarcely worthy of the volume to which it is attached.\n\nDuring the following season, 1875-6, Mr. Burgess visited the caves of Dara S\u016br or Sinha, in the Nizam's territory, and explored several sites in their neighbourhood hitherto undescribed. He also visited and made drawings of the caves in the neighbourhood of Aurungabad, which are of great interest, but, hitherto, little known to the antiquarian world. The results of these explorations are embodied in a report now in the press, which, it is expected, will shortly be published. Mr. Burgess also visited and measured the caves at Junir and others in the neighbourhood of Bombay, an account of which will be embodied in this Report.\n\nDuring the past year, 1876-7, Mr. Burgess has been principally employed in a thorough examination of the caves of Ellora, which were cleared out, at considerable expense, by\norder of Sir Salar Jung, in expectation of the Prince of Wales' visit to them. He has also superintended the re-examination of those at Ajunta by Mr. Griffiths.\n\nIf Mr. Burgess's plan of operations be successfully carried out, he will, personally, have visited and explored nearly all the caves of the Western side of India, at the same time obtaining plans and details of all the most interesting examples. Under these circumstances, an application has been made to the India Office to allow him to remain in England during next cold weather, in order that he may pass through the press a work on the Rock-cut Temples of Western India, which he undertook to prepare, in conjunction with Mr. Fergusson, before his appointment as Archaeological Surveyor of Western India. As this project received the approval and sanction of Her Majesty's Secretary of State for India in 1871, it is probable the leave asked for will be granted. As, moreover, all the materials requisite for its completion have now been collected, it appears to the Council desirable that it should be published with as little delay as is compatible with its proper execution.\n\nIn Ceylon satisfactory work continues to be done, and Dr. Goldschmidt's \"Report on the Inscriptions found by him in the North Central Province, and in the Hambantota District\" gives hope that his antiquarian exertions may lead to the recovery of many monuments of even greater value than those he has as yet described. What he has met with up to the present time may be conveniently divided, as in the Report, into\u2014\n\n1. Inscriptions of the earliest period \"from the introduction of Buddhism to the beginning of the Christian era,\" consisting as these do, generally, when not merely indicative of the ownership of the cave, of brief dedications to the priesthood. These are written in the Southern Alphabet of the Indian king Dharmigoka, with slight modifications, and, occasionally, in more recent forms not greatly differing from those of King\nGangab\u00e1hu's time (second century A.D.). The proper names of the donors or proprietors are often interesting, and there are a few ancient words, as parumaka or barumaka (Brahman); jet\u00e1 (daughter), and some others, which will be interesting to students of the Sinhalese language. There are also some important and unexpected grammatical forms.\n\n2. \"From the beginning of the Christian era to the fourth century A.D.\" In this period are many inscriptions of King Gajab\u00e1hu G\u00e1mani (A.D. 113-125). One on the Habaran\u00e9 Rock records the construction of a vast tank of more than 16,000 acres, and its being handed over to the priests of Buddha for preservation; two others mention the construction of Chaityas, with various grants to the priesthood, the district of Hambantota, in the Southern province of the island, being rich in such dedications. There is also an inscription on a rock at Kirind\u00e9, showing a transitional state of the language, as it contains many Pali words, in a form, too, which throws some doubt on the alleged antiquity of the Pali language, at least, in its present form.\n\n3. \"From the fifth to the eleventh century A.D.\" Of this period, probably between the ninth and eleventh century, Dr. Goldschmidt notices one inscription that has proved of considerable value to him, in that it fixes the dates of many others. The donor is the son of a King Abh\u00e1 Salamewan, of whom inscriptions also exist. As the language of these inscriptions, though not devoid of adopted Sanskrit and Pali words, is still in a Sinhalese shape\u2014and as, soon afterwards, Sanskrit words are found abundantly in the speech of Ceylon, it may be presumed that the modern mixed speech came into existence in the eleventh and twelfth centuries A.D. Sinhalese literature must also have commenced about the same period, as its language carries with it the spoils of many foregoing centuries.\n\n4. \"Inscriptions at Polonaruwa, Mineri, Dambulla.\" Polonaruwa, having become the capital of Ceylon on the decay of\nAnur\u0101dhapura, has few inscriptions of antiquity; indeed its most extensive ruins belong to the reigns of Par\u0101kramab\u0101hu the Great, and of Nissanka Malla: of the first, one inscription only has been met with, but this is a very long one. On the other hand, Nissanka's inscriptions, giving minute details of his life, abound. One piece of evidence may be drawn from these inscriptions, that the Princes of Kalinga (from whom the people of Ceylon are often admonished to select their kings) were Buddhists, and, therefore, that so late as the close of the twelfth century there was a Buddhistic dynasty reigning in the South of India. In conclusion, Dr. Goldschmidt states that, as yet, the jungle covering the ancient streets of Polonnaruwa has been only partially cleared away; and, therefore, that there is reason to expect that many more inscriptions, though probably of a somewhat modern period, will be discovered. We regret extremely to hear that Dr. Goldschmidt died, a few weeks since, before having brought to a conclusion his valuable researches.\n\nThe Society has recently received from the Secretary of State for India the late Mr. J. W. Breeds' \"Account of the Primitive Tribes and Monuments of the Nilagiris,\" a work of the highest interest and value to the student of Ethnology, and, especially, of the descendants of early races who were, probably, in the same parts of Southern India, where they are still found, before the advent of the Aryans. Nor will the archaeologist fail to recognize the importance of the illustrations of the ancient cairns, cromlechs, and miscellaneous antiquities recorded in this book, together with the remarkable relics discovered at Sholur, Melur, Achenna and other places. The volume is illustrated by eighty-three photographs. Two more volumes have also been added, to the six previously in the Library of the Society, of \"The People of India,\" edited by Dr. Forbes Watson and the late Sir John W. Kaye. The first of these (vol. vii.) treats of the districts of Rajpootana, Central India, and Berar, respectively, and is illustrated by sixty-five\nphotographs; second (vol. viii.), of Mysore, Coorg, the N\u00edlagiris, Madras, Travancore, the Malay Peninsula, Burma, and Arracan. This volume is illustrated by sixty-three photographs.\n\nIndian Antiquary.\u2014In the \"Indian Antiquary\" a few papers have been given bearing on recent researches among the caves and sculptured monuments of India, a brief notice of which may be given here. Thus Sir Walter Elliot contributes a paper \"On some remains of Antiquity at H\u00e1nagal in the Southern Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 country,\" with a plate showing the position of some ancient lines of earthwork surrounding an old fortification, the central structure being from seven hundred to eight hundred yards in diameter, while the circuit of the whole area connected with these works, is not less than four miles and a half. It has not as yet been possible to identify these works with any known ancient site; but its position, on the frontier between the Ch\u00e1lukya and Ch\u00e9ra kingdoms, shows that it must have been a military post of value, when these two powerful states were in the ascendant. Sir Walter Elliot is, however, inclined to think that it may have been only the location of a pre-historic pastoral tribe, who made it their principal station, requiring, as they would, a large adjacent area for the protection of their cattle.\n\nTo that indefatigable antiquary, Mr. M. J. Walhouse, we are indebted for two papers entitled \"Arch\u00e6ological Notes,\" in the first of which he gives a curious account of the provenance of the beryl (or Aqua Marina), which has been chiefly procured at a village called Padiar (or Patt\u00ed\u00e1li) near Koimb\u00e1t\u00far, on the edge of the N\u00edlagiris. Mr. Walhouse adds a description of many remarkable gems in Aqua Marina, still preserved in European cabinets. In his second paper, Mr. Walhouse notices several \"curious tombs and entombments,\" and discusses the question of the dates of the circles called by the Tudas \"Azarams,\" illustrating his views by an account of\nthe recent funeral of the (Syrian) Metropolitan of Malabar, in 1874, when many traditionally ancient customs were observed.\n\nMr. Walhouse adds some remarks on \"Dolmens and extinct races\" (with a plate), in which he points out the remarkable connexion between the terra-cotta tombs found by Mr. Garstin in South Arkot, and those of Babylonia and Etruria. Mr. Walhouse has, also, exhibited before the Anthropological Institute a curious collection of iron arrow-heads from Southern India, many of the larger and broader of which are still used by the Jungle Tribes in the Nilagiri Hills and Western Ghats. Their bows are of bamboo, with cords of raffia. Though small and meagre men, the force with which the arrows strike would satisfy one of Robin Hood's men, the shafts going almost through the bodies of the animals. The same remarkable power is well indicated on many of the Assyrian sculptures.\n\nMr. G. H. Johns notices \"Some little known Buddha Excavations in the Purna Collectorate,\" the most important being at a place called Bhanchandra; and Mr. Garstin gives an interesting note on the Dolmens, near Tirakovilar, on the east bank of the Punnar: these resemble those found by Captain Cole in Coorg and Mysore.\n\nMr. W. F. Sinclair gives a report \"On some Caves in the Karjat Taluka of the Thana Collectorate,\" which have been long known, and partially noticed by Dr. Wilson in his \"Remains of Western India,\" but, only, superficially. Mr. Sinclair gives reasons for supposing that these caves are of remote antiquity, much older, anyhow, than those at Salsette. They are situate at the northern end of the Bhor Gh\u00e1t Ravine. The fa\u00e7ade of one of the caves resembles that at K\u00e1li. Lastly, Mr. Burgess contributes an important memoir \"On the Buddhist Caves of Junnar,\" remarkable, as these are, for the absence of figure ornamentation, so invariable at Ajunta, Ellora, K\u00e1li, and other places. Some of these caves are now occupied by Brahmans, who worship, as a Saiva\nGoddess, the mutilated images of Buddha. Mr. Burgess's memoir is much increased in value by the addition of the translations, by Professor Kern of Leiden, of the Inscriptions found at Junnar. Dr. Kern considers them to be from 200 to 300 years later than those of A\u1e63oka, though the character in which they are written is quite the same.\n\nDr. (now Bishop) Caldwell adds some very interesting remarks on \"Explorations\" conducted by him \"at Korkei and Kayal\"\u2014the former of which names he thinks may be identified with the \u039a\u03cc\u03bb\u03c7\u03bf\u03b9 of the Greeks, in those days the chief emporium of the Pearl Trade, and, according to native tradition, the cradle of South Indian civilization. Kayal he thinks, with Colonel Yule, is, most likely, the Cael of Marco Polo.\n\nBesides the papers already alluded to, as bearing more directly upon antiquarian research, a considerable number of valuable memoirs have been published during the last year, in the pages of the Indian Antiquary. Thus Mr. Beal has given us a Buddhist Jataka from the Chinese: Mr. Rehatsek a paper \"On the Twelve Im\u00e1ms:\" Mr. McCrindle some useful and valuable notes to Arrian's Indica, which, as stated in the Report of last year, he has recently translated; together with fragments of the \"Indika\" of Megasthenes, preserved in quotations from it by Diodorus, Arrian, Strabo, \u00c6lian, Pliny, and others: Mr. Kearns a curious paper on Right-hand and Left-hand Castes: Major Watson a very interesting historical sketch of the principal Charada settlements in Gujarat. The papers more especially relating to languages, or inscriptions, have, as a rule, been referred to, under their several heads.\n\nThe Statistical Survey of India has proceeded rapidly during the past year. This work comprises, as the Society is already aware, a complete examination of each British district or native state of India, and thus extends over an area nearly equal to that of all Europe, except Russia, with a population, too,\nexceeding that of Europe, less Russia, by about ten million of souls.\n\nAfter a series of unsuccessful efforts, the Indian Government, in 1869, requested Dr. W. W. Hunter to draw up a scheme for the execution of this work. In 1871 the Statistical Department of India was created with a special view to this survey, and Dr. Hunter was appointed Director-General of the whole of the necessary operations. During the last six years the 233 British districts of India have been surveyed, and materials have been now obtained for the statistical account of each of them. Of these surveys about three-fourths are in print, making seventy volumes of 23,000 pages.\n\nThe account of the largest Province, Bengal, representing one-third of the whole population of British India, has been completed. This province, together with Assam, was retained by Dr. Hunter in his own hands; the other ten provinces or governorships being allotted by him to provincial compilers working under his superintendence. The first five volumes of this branch were issued last year, and some months since, Government issued its final orders for the completion of the whole in twenty volumes. The remaining fifteen volumes have not, however, as yet, been issued, owing to the unavoidable delays caused in the preparation of the vast number of maps. An idea of the magnitude of the operations may be formed from the letter of thanks, etc., recently forwarded to the Director-General from the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, and which has been published in his Official Gazette. From these documents we gather, that the statistical account of Bengal alone deals with a population of sixty-two millions and three-quarters, \"comprising races more varied in character and more numerous than the populations of England, Scotland, Ireland, Norway, Holland, Greece, Turkey in Europe, Roumania, Servia, and all the non-Indian colonies and dependencies of the British Crown put together.\"\nThe collection of local materials, and the perambulation of the Bengal districts by Dr. Hunter, occupied five years; the compilation and the printing of the work about two years and a half more. The finished work, in twenty volumes, contains from 7000 to 8000 pages of close type; and every proof-sheet, after having been revised by Dr. Hunter, has been sent out to Bengal, and revised again, first by the Government in Calcutta, and secondly in the particular district to which the individual sheet referred. The delay, however, incurred by this somewhat tedious process has been counteracted by the command of an enormous amount of type. Five of the largest printing firms in Great Britain were simultaneously employed, and the Government Gazette states that the matter kept standing in type for the work, at times, exceeded 3500 pages.\n\n\"The account of Bengal,\" says the official report, \"furnishes a complete hand-book for the administration of each district or province under that Government.\" It has, also, been rendered, so far as the opportunities permitted, \"a great national record such as modern inquirers might have wished the English Domesday to have been, or such as the Oriental student would fain have found in the Ain-i-Akbari.\"\n\nUnder recently issued orders from the Indian Government, Dr. Hunter, having finished the account of Bengal, is now pressing forward the similar works for the other parts of India. The whole will make about one hundred volumes, and these are to be condensed by the Director-General into five, alphabetically arranged for popular use, under the name of the \"Imperial Gazetteer of India.\" This work will be issued under the revision and by the authority of the Government, and its completion may be expected in four years.\n\nGeneral Progress of Oriental Studies\u2014Aryan Languages of India\u2014Sanskrit.\u2014In the field of Sanskrit studies, the unremitting zeal of scholars has manifested itself by labours in various branches, the more important being those on Vedic\nand grammatical literature, on inscriptions, and arch\u00e6ological matters. The Rig-Veda continues to be carefully studied, and its difficulties have been further elucidated by the two contemporaneous translations of it by Profs. Grassmann and Ludwig (alluded to in our last Report), the latter of which is now completely finished. The Rev. K. M. Banerjea, to whom we owe so many valuable researches into the different phases of Hindu religious thought, has continued his labours in the Vedic field; and an interesting work has been commenced at Bombay by an anonymous scholar, and has made some progress, viz. \"An Attempt to Interpret the Vedas,\" with a commentary in Marathi.\n\nThe literature of the S\u0101maveda has received a most exhaustive treatment in Dr. Burnell's Preface to his edition of the \u0100ruheya Br\u0101hma\u1e47a, in which he has thoroughly sifted the chaff from the wheat, and, thereby, saved much dreary labour to those who would feel encouraged to work in the same direction, after him. The \u0100ranyakasamhita of the same Veda has been published with a Russian translation by Fortunatoff, at Moscow. Even the White Yajurveda has been republished with a Hindi commentary by a landholder and proprietor of a lithographic press at Fort Biswan, ambitious of literary fame, but his edition does not, of course, possess any scholarly value. Professor Delbr\u00fcck has given, as the result of his linguistic studies in this direction, his \"Alt-Indische Tempus-Lehre.\"\n\nOur knowledge of the history of Sanskrit grammarians has been greatly enlarged by the important work of Dr. Kielhorn's edition of \"K\u0101ty\u0101yana and Patanjali in their relation to each other and to P\u0101nini;\" a work which might be usefully studied in connexion with Mr. Burnell's \"Aindra School of Sanskrit Grammarians.\"\n\nThe activity displayed in the deciphering of ancient inscriptions, as shown by the admirable papers published in the \"Indian Antiquary\" by Messrs. Fleet, B\u00fchler, Kern, Kittel,\nNilkantha, and others, bears testimony to the recognized importance of such records for the establishment of a solid historical basis in the place of a confused chaos of chronological guesswork. The advance made in this and in similar matters of archaeology, as shown by the many able papers published in the Journals of the Asiatic Societies of Bengal and Bombay, and in Dr. P. Goldschmidt's Report from Ceylon, to some of which allusion has already been made, is already considerable, and will, by-and-by, form a most essential help in the reconstruction of our knowledge of Indian antiquities.\n\nThe subject of Law and Customs has had its share of attention in the publications of Professors Stenzler of Breslau, and Jolly of Wurtzburg; the first of whom has published the text of the Gautama-dharma\u015b\u0101stra, and of P\u0101raskara's Grihya-s\u016btra; the second, a translation of the N\u0101rad\u012bya Dharma\u015b\u0101stra (to be followed by the original text), and a paper on the legal status of women gathered from the old Indian law-books.\n\nThe search for MSS. instituted by the Indian Government has brought us further continuations of Rajendral\u0101la Mitra's valuable notices, of Dr. B\u00fchler's reports, with additional lists of MSS. existing in various parts of India.\n\nA very intricate subject, which seems to have almost dropped out of notice, since Sir William Jones's days, has lately received renewed attention from several English-writing Hindus\u2014viz. the \"Theory of Music.\" It may, however, well be doubted whether, in spite of their laudable desire to clear up this obscure matter, they have been able to make their views intelligible to European musicians. The essential differences existing between the Eastern and the Western theories render it almost hopeless that any intimate connexion should be established between them. In this attempt, Sourindro Mohun Tagore and Loke Nath Gose have taken a prominent part. Besides these, a large number of other works or papers bearing on Sanskrit or kindred subjects have recently ap-\npeared, some of which must be noticed here. The Rev. F. Foulkes has recently published at Madras a curious volume, translated from the Sanskrit, entitled \"The legends of the shrine of Hari-Hara,\" one of the numerous Hindu writings of the Mahatmya, or Temple-legend class. The spirit of the teaching conveyed in it is, that the Deity assumed the form of the God Hari-Hara to prove to mankind that the supposed difference between Shiva and Vishnu is deceptive and unreal.\n\n\"I worship Thee,\" says one of the Hymns, \"far away in the sky; who, in the form of Brahma, art the Creator; in the form of Vishnu, art the Preserver; in the form of Rudra, art the Destroyer.\"\n\nTo Mr. F. S. Growse, we owe an edition of the Ramayana of Tulsi Das, the especial value of which is, that it represents what is still the most trustworthy guide to the popular and living faith of the Hindi race. Though the colloquial idiom of Tulsi Das is not comparable with the classical Sanskrit of Valmiki, it is useful as bridging over the chasm between the modern style and the medieval. Three different editions of the Sakuntala have appeared during the last year; thus Prof. Monier Williams has given us a second edition, marked with the same learning and good sense as was his first; Prof. Pischel has published its Bengali recension; and Prof. L. Fritz, a metrical version, which has received just commendation. Prof. Benfey has given a short paper \"On Rig-Veda, x. 10, 7; Ath. xviii. 1, 8,\" in Bezzemberger's Beitrage z. Kunde d. Indo-Germ. Sprache; Prof. Pischel has also published Hemachandra's Grammatik der Prakrit Sprache. Mr. Avery, of Iowa, contributes, also, to the history of the Verb-inflection in Sanskrit;\u2014M. Regnaud, Le Chariot de Terre Ouite attribu\u00e9 au Roi Sudraka;\u2014Prof. Aufrecht, Die Hymnen des Rig Veda (vol. i. Mandala i.-vi.);\u2014M. Grimblot, Sept Suttas P\u00e2lis tir\u00e9s du Digha Nik\u00e2ya et Par\u00eeta;\u2014M. Hillebrandt, \u00dcber die Gotthe Aditi, an excellent Vedic study;\u2014Ram Das Sen, a second volume of\nthe *Aitih\u00e1sika Rahasya* (or Historical Essays), which would be useful in an English translation; F. A. Grube, *Suparn\u00e1-dhy\u00e1yah* (the Fable of *Suparna*), part of which has already been published in Weber's *Indische Studien*; Prof. Weber, the second edition of his *Akademische Vorlesungen \u00fcber Indische Literatur-Geschichte*, a most valuable work, in which he has incorporated all the most important new matter relating to the Vedas, etc., which has been brought to light, since, twenty-three years ago, he first published this book. He has, also, given in the Monatsb. der Berl. Acad., a curious paper, entitled \"Ein synonymisches Sanskrit Glossar aus dem Nachlass des Demetrius Galanos,\" and proposes to publish a third volume of his \"Indische Streifen.\"\n\nMore than forty years ago Mr. Brian Hodgson presented to this Society, and to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Asiatique at Paris, a large number of Sanskrit and Tibetan MSS., which he had collected in Tibet, and which were catalogued by Professors Cowell and Eggeling a short time since. We rejoice to learn that the University of Cambridge has recently acquired a still more valuable collection of similar MSS., illustrative of the history and doctrines of Northern Buddhism. This collection, the especial feature of which is the high antiquity of many of the individual MSS., has been made by Dr. Daniel Wright, the brother of the well-known Professor of Arabic, Dr. W. Wright, who lived for some years in Nip\u00e1l as the medical officer attached to the Residency. All the older MSS. are on palm-leaves, and many of them are dated in the Nip\u00e1lese era or Samvat, which commences A.D. 880. The three chief treasures of the collection are two copies of the *Ashtas\u00e1hasrik\u00e1*, dated, respectively, in the 3rd and 5th years of the Nip\u00e1lese era, A.D. 883 and 885; and a copy of the *K\u00e1sya K\u00e1\u1e47\u1e0da-Kram\u00e1rali*, dated in the 10th year, or A.D. 890. Besides these, there is another copy of the *Ashtas\u00e1hasrik\u00e1* dated A.D. 1008, and, from this date forwards, there is a continuous series of MSS., illustrating the\nwriting of each successive century down to the present time. These MSS. will be of the highest value for future editors or translators of the Northern Buddhist texts. The Tantra literature is especially well represented; and, among other names, we may mention the \u0100rya-Manju\u1e63r\u012b-m\u0101la-tantra, the historical importance of which has been fully pointed out by Burnouf. One of the greatest treasures of the collection is a fine copy, dated A.D. 1551, of Ya\u015bomitra's commentary on Vasubandhu's Abhidharma-k\u014dsa. There is a MS. of it at Paris as well as in Calcutta, but both are far too incorrect to serve as the basis of an edition. Dr. Wright has himself given a rough list of all the MSS. in his work just published, at the Cambridge University Press, \"History of Nipal, translated from the Parbutiya by Munshi Shew Shanker Singh and Pandit Shri Gunanand.\"\n\nDr. E. M\u00fcller has also published Beitr\u00e4ge zur Grammatik des Jaina-Prakrit\u2014a work containing an able comparison between the Jain Prakrit on the one hand, and the Sanskrit and the other Prakrits, especially Pali, on the other. Of miscellaneous papers, of value and interest, may be mentioned (in the Indian Antiquary), Mr. J. F. Kearns's translation of the Atma-Buddha Prakritika;\u2014Prof. Kielhorn's \"Remarks on the Sikkhas\";\u2014Indraj\u012b's \"Indian Numerals\";\u2014Dr. J. Muir's \"Maxims from the Mahabharata\";\u2014and Mr. Telang's Sankara Vijaya; and Rajendralal Mitra has commenced the publication, in the Bibliotheca Indica, of the Kitareya Aranyakas and of the Vidy\u0101-bhishana.\u2014In the Bibliotheca Indica, also, are many further continuations to works in progress, and the commencement of V\u0101chaspati Mi\u015bra's Bh\u0101nat\u012b, a gloss to Br\u0101hma-s\u016btras. The \"Pandit,\" now in an 8vo. form, prints the Sarva-dar\u015bana-samgraha, the Pratyabhijn\u0101 Dar\u015bana, the \u015aulva S\u016btra of Baudh\u0101yana, with stories, aphorisms, etc., illustrative of the S\u0101\u1e45khya Doctrine.\u2014The Baillie Collection of MSS., amounting to 125 vols., has been catalogued, including a copy of the Mah\u0101-\nbh\u00e1rata, on a roll, 228 ft. long, and 5\u00bd in. broad.\u2014In Italy, M. Angelo de Gubernatis has done good work, by instituting an examination into the various stores of Indian MSS. in the Borgian and Florence Libraries, in those of the King of Italy at Turin and Rome, and by an able paper from his own pen, entitled \"Materiaux pour servir \u00e0 l'histoire des Etudes Orientales en Italie.\"\u2014In Pali, Mr. Fausb\u00f6ll has published a Grammar in Sinhalese; and M. Feer, Etude sur les Jatakas; in Hindi, Mr. Kellogg has issued a valuable Grammar; M. M. Bhatt, the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata translated from the Sanskrit into Hindi; and Mr. Bate, a new and enlarged form of Thompson's Dictionary; and, in Hindustani, M. de Tassy has given his annual and comprehensive report. Mr. Fallon's Dictionary has reached its seventh part.\n\nAfghanistan and W. India.\u2014To Major Mockler we are indebted for a grammar of the Baluchi language, of much interest to the philologist as showing clearly that this dialect is an offshoot of the great Aryan family of languages, and most likely derived from the old Persian.\u2014The Rev. Mr. Hughes has published the Khalid-i-Afgh\u00e1n\u00ed, and Mr. T. C. Plowden a translation of the same work, as the text-book for examination in Pushto.\u2014Prof. Trumpp has also issued a translation of the Adi Granth.\n\nNon-Aryan Languages of India.\u2014Mr. Burnell has printed at Tranquebar, the exact text of the famous Tamil Grammar by Father Beschi; and Mr. Kearns a translation of the Silpa S\u00e1stra. Dr. Bower has also recently published at Madras, in a short and convenient form, the \"Nannul\" of Pavananti, the Tamil Grammar, as the Kural of Tiruvalluvar is the Tamil Classic. A Canarese and English School Dictionary has also been published anonymously. To the pages of the Indian Antiquary Dr. Pope has contributed two papers \"On the South Indian and Dravidian Languages,\" in the first of\nwhich he maintains, contrary to the more usually accepted views, that there are deeply seated radical affinities between the Aryan and Dravidian; that the differences are not so great as between the Celtic and the Sanskrit; and, therefore, that the Dravidian tongues ought to be classed with the Aryan. He even thinks, and has, to some extent, demonstrated, the existence of a law of the interchange of consonants bearing some analogy to that proposed by Grimm for the Indo-European languages. In his second paper he remarks that words, undoubtedly of Sanskrit origin, are often so changed in the Dravidian languages by the operation of well-known phonetic laws as to be hardly recognizable again: thus the equivalents of the Sanskrit sarpa (serpens\u2014\u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2) in Tamil, are, charppam, charudam, araeom, aravu, ara, ara, and ari. Many Dravidian words are supposed by the native grammarians to be of Sanskrit origin; they are, however, probably older.\n\nFurther Indian and Malayo-Polynesian.\u2014Occasional but scanty notices have appeared in the Reports of this Society of some of the works published by Dutch scholars, in illustration or description of the languages spoken in their colonial possessions; but these have hitherto been altogether inadequate to the importance of the subject they professed to treat of, and did but scant justice to the industry and learning of the Orientalists of Holland, who, in their comparatively limited field of research, have to deal with no less than ten distinct languages, with large numbers, also, of local dialects, which, scarcely deserving the name of languages, are intelligible within certain narrow limits. The two leading languages are the Malay, the lingua franca everywhere, and the Javanese, with a host of subordinate dialects, such as Madurese, Balinese, and Sundanese, the Bugi and Macassar of the Island of Celebes, and the Battah, Lampung, and Rejang of Sumatra, with no less than six distinct written characters. All these\nare living languages; but, in addition to them, the Kawi or old Javanese must not be forgotten, with its abundant literature.\n\nIn 1875, a general Catalogue was published at Leiden, including all the books issued by Dutch scholars from the beginning of the present century to 1874, and a noble memorial it is of good work done, little as it may be known or appreciated beyond Dutch circles. The names of Van der Tuuk, Kern, Matthes, Hardenson, Van Eck, Vreede, Cohen-Stuart, Pijnappel, and Niemann, some of them Protestant Missionaries, and others, Professors in the Universities of Leiden or Utrecht, are sufficient evidence of the work to which they have applied their minds; though, possibly, owing to the Dutch language being but little studied, except for commercial purposes, the real learning to be found in their works has been in some degree overshadowed by the more popular, or more generally intelligible, researches of German and French scholars. Since 1874, we have to record the publication of a Balinese Dictionary and Grammar by Van Eck; a study of the five local dialects of Amboyna in the Moluccas, by Van Hoevel, junior; the second part of the Handbook of Madura, by Vreede; a Malay Dictionary by the late M. Van der Wall\u2014to be continued by Van der Tuuk; a vocabulary of the Malay Languages of the Moluccas, by Le Clercq; and the Folklore of Celebes by Matthes. To the Abb\u00e9 Favre we also owe a Grammaire de la langue Malaise, published at Vienna in 1876.\n\nM. Van der Lilt, Professor of Law at Leiden, has published a work on the Administration of British India, and another on the Eastern Colonies of Holland. M. Vett, Professor of History in the same University, has continued his great work on Java; while, to the Bible Society of Amsterdam, to the two Missionary Societies of Rotterdam and Utrecht, to the Royal Society of Batavia and to the Asiatic Society of the Hague, we are indebted for the active\nencouragement of the above researches. Professorial chairs for the chief Oriental languages have been established at the State Universities, and provision has been made for testing the qualifications of the members of the Civil Service. In the pages of the Transactions and Journal of the Royal Society of Batavia, and in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of the Hague, are the following important papers:\n\nVan Eck, R.\u2014Bagoes Hoemlar\u00e0 of Manto\u00ef Koripan, Balinesech Gediet, Bali and Dutch. Bat. Taal. xi. i.\n\nTekst en Verlating van de Megar-tak\u00e0 Bali-nesech, Gagoeritan. Deel xxiii.\n\nMiklucho-Maclay, N. V.\u2014Sprach-rudimente der Orang-Utan von Johore.

A.\u2014Bijdrage tot de kennis der Alfoeren van het Eiland Boeroe. Tidschr. voor Ind. Taal.\n\nLe Clercq, F. S., has published separately \"Het Maleisch d. Molukken,\" containing words from Manado, Ternate, Ambon, Bonda, Timor and Koepang. Batav., 4to., 1876; as has also M. van der Tuuk, his \"Maleisch Leesboek.\" Gravenhage. In connexion with this branch of the subject we may mention a work by M. Bronson, a Dictionary in Assamese and English, 8vo.; and A. M. H., A \"Grammaire Birmane,\" traduit de l'Anglais.\n\nMr. Burnell has given an interesting account of \"Literary work in Java\" in the Academy of Sept. 2, 1876; and Colonel Yule has written an able article on Cambodia in the Encyclop. Britann. ix. ed. vol. iv. M. Philastre has received the Stanislas-Julien Prize for his learned work, entitled Le Codo Annamite.\nIt has been announced that that well-known Japanese scholar, the Count de Montblanc, is about to publish three works of considerable linguistic interest\u2014a \"Grammaire nouvelle de la langue Tagala;\" \"Analogie de la langue Visaya;\" and \"Liaison intime des idiomes Philippins antiques.\"\n\nIn the neighbouring kingdom of Belgium, Prof. N\u00e9ve, of the University of Louvain, a Corresponding Member of this Society, represents in his own person, the Oriental knowledge of the country. Count Goblet d'Alviella, of the staff of the Ind\u00e9pendance Belge, who accompanied H.R.H. the Prince of Wales to India, and made good use of his time, has since published a work on the Administrative system of British India.\n\nThe occupation of Cochin-China by the French has let light into very dark places. Thus Aubaret has published an excellent Grammar of the Annamite Language, and the veil is gradually being lifted which shrouded the ancient Cambodian tongue, and obscured our knowledge of the modern dialect of the people of that district. With this view, M. Aymonier has published in Paris a Dictionary of French and Cambodian and other elementary works, and we may look forward to the publication of a Grammar, and to the translation of the hitherto undeciphered inscriptions in the old temples of Angeour. Some insight into the language of the Indigenous Malayan Hill Races in the Island of Formosa has been supplied by Mr. Tainter, in the Journal of the North China Branch of the R.A.S., and by the Abb\u00e9 Favre in the Bulletin Geographique of Paris. In connexion with these may be noted J. L. van Hasselt's Hollandsch Noefoorsche woordenboek (Utrecht, 1876), and Beknopte Spraak-kunst der Noefoorsche Taal; Mr. Cushing's Grammar of the Sh\u00e2n Language; and M. L. de Backer's L'Extr\u00eame Orient au Moyen Age (Paris, 1877). In the Revue de Philologie, conducted by M. Ujfalvy, in Paris, is a Memoir by M. Castelnau on the\nMantias, one of the savage Negrito races in the interior of the Peninsula of Malacca.\n\nChinese.\u2014In China, the last year has been fruitful in the production of many valuable works, among which we may specify\u2014\n\nA Catalogue of Chinese Printed Books, MSS., and Drawings in the Library of the British Museum. By Prof. R. K. Douglas, M.R.A.S. 1877. And, \"China,\" Encyclop. Brit., ninth edition.\n\nA Manual of Chinese Bibliography\u2014a list of works and essays relating to China. By O. von Moellendorff. Shanghai, 1876.\n\nA Chinese Dictionary in the Cantonese Dialect. Part 1. A to K. By Ernest John Eitel. 1877.\n\nThai-kih-thu, with Tschu-hi's commentary\u2014Chinese, Manchu, and German. By George v. Gabelentz, a worthy son of an illustrious father. Dresden. 1876.\n\nAn Introduction to the Study of the Chinese Characters. By J. Edkins, D.D. Lond. 1876.\n\nTo these we may add:\n\nRichthofen, F. v.\u2014Erlebnisse eigener Reisen und darauf gegrundeter Studien. Vol. i. 1876.\n\nKleczowski, J.\u2014Cours graduel et complet de Chinois parl\u00e9 et \u00e9crit, tir\u00e9e de \"L'Arte China\" du P. Gonsalves.\n\nDennys, N. B.\u2014Folklore of China, and its Affinities with that of the Aryan and Semitic Races.\n\nSchereschewsky.\u2014Paper on Versions of the Chinese Language in the proposed Mongolian Version. (In American Or. Soc. Nov. 1875, May, 1876.)\n\nDouglas, Prof.\u2014Chinesische Sprache und Literatur. (A transl. by Dr. W. Henkel.)\n\nPfizmaier, Dr. A.\u2014History of the Court of Tsin. Sitz. ber. d. Acad. Wien.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 History of the Period of Yuen Khang of Tsin, A.D. 291-299. Ibid.\nPfizmaier, Dr. A.\u2014Complement to the Essay on the Trees of China. Ibid.\n\nLegge, J., D.D.\u2014Inaugural Lecture on the constituting a Chinese Chair at Oxford, October, 1876.\n\nIt is right further to state that M. Moellendorff\u2019s work, noticed above, contains, practically, a full catalogue of every work relating to China. It is of some interest that this and other works on kindred subjects are now printed in English. Not long since, in concluding a treaty with China and Japan, the Peruvian Envoy insisted on a tripartite text for both agreements, and that, in case of any difference of opinion, the English text should be accepted as final. We may further add, that Mr. A. van Name (of Newhaven) has recently published a History of the Corean Language, in connexion with Dallet\u2019s Histoire de l\u2019Eglise de Cor\u00e9e; that Mr. W. T. Mayers has recently compiled a Grammar and Vocabulary of the Corean Language; and that the Rev. Canon McClatchie, who, twenty-seven years ago, contributed to the Journal of this Society (Vol. XVI. 1856) a very interesting paper on \u201cChinese Theology,\u201d has printed the first translation of the Confucian Cosmogony (China Review, vol. iv. p. 2), as well as a translation into English of the Yih King of Confucius. Mr. McClatchie is now occupied on a translation of Confucius\u2019s Le ke or Book of Rites. A remarkable work has been recently printed in China with the title \u201cCatalogus Patrum ac Fratrum e Societate Jesu qui \u00e0 morte S. Fr. Xavierii ad annum MDCCCLXII. Evangelio Xti Propagando in Sinis adlaboraverunt.\u201d This work, which bears the \u201cimprimatur\u201d of Adrian, Bp. of Nankin in 1873, will no doubt be of some value for history and of still greater local usefulness; as it is well known that many works were compiled in Chinese during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, under the influence of the Jesuits, but with the names of their authors so disguised in their Chinese forms, as to be, practically, unrecognizable.\nIn Japanese we note a continuous and steady progress. Thus we may call attention to Hoffmann's Japanese Sprachlehre, Leiden, 1877; to Mr. E. M. Satow's Revival of Pure Shinto, the creed of Japan previously to Buddhism; and to Satow, E. M., and Ishibashi Masakata, an English and Japanese Dictionary; to two able papers by M. Pfitzmaier in the Sitz. ber. of the Academy of Vienna, \"On Japanese Geographical Names,\" and \"Notices of the Japanese Poet, Sei Sa\u00f4-na-gon,\" a writer of the tenth century A.D., and \"Der Nebel der Klage, ein Japanisches Zeitbild,\" 4to. Wien, 1876; there are, also, various interesting Notices in the Bolletino Italiano, showing that the study of this language is pursued energetically by the scholars of Italy, as, for instance, the \"Repertorio Sinico-Giapponese,\" a catalogue of Japanese books in the \"Biblioteca Vittorio-Emmanuele\" at Rome. Mr. Basil Hall Chamberlain has also printed an excellent Essay on those curiosities of Philology, the \"Pillow-words\" of the Japanese language.\n\nThe Society for the Study of Japanese, under the presidency of the Count Charles de Montblanc, has just completed its valuable work, \"Extraits des histoires du Japon.\" This work is contained in three fasciculi, and is preceded by an analytical introduction drawn up by M. Imamura Warau, who has also contributed articles to the Mem. de la Soc. d'Ethnogr., vol. xiii. These \"extracts\" will prove of the greatest value to the student.\n\nAltaic and Ugro-Finnish and Turkish.\u2014In the pages of the Journal of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Linguistique de Paris is a remarkable paper by Dr. Donner of Helsingfors, \"On Ugro-Finnic Studies,\" and the same scholar has recently completed the second volume of his Finnic Dictionary: and, in the Revue de Philologie, conducted at Paris by M. Ujfalvy, are, a translation into French of M. Schott's Essay on the Tschouwaches, a tribe of the Turkish branch of the Altaic family; on the\nlanguage of the Ugro-Finnish branch of the Altaic family by M. Ujfalvy; some very important remarks on the classification of the Uralic or agglutinating languages of Northern Asia by Prince Louis Lucien Bonaparte; an Essay on the Volga; and an Essay on the grammar of the Vepsa or Tchudish Mordvin, one of the Altaic family, by Vladimir de Mainof. To these may be added, M. Schott, \"Zur Uiguren Frages,\" in the Abh. d. Kon. Acad. z. Berlin; M. Balint, Kazani Tatar, Buda-Pest, 1876; Hunfalvy, Magarorsz\u00e1g Ethnographiaja, Buda-Pest, 1876; and Col. Prejevalsky's \"Mongolia, the Tangut country and the solitudes of Northern Tibet,\" recently translated from the Russ by E. Delmar Morgan, with notes by Colonel Yule, C.B.\n\nIn Turkish, may be noticed Ahmed Vefyq Efendi's Lehdj\u00e8-J-Osmani Dictionnaire Ottoman, 2 vols. 8vo.; R. D. Shaw's Sketch of the Turkish language of Eastern Turkestan; Lorenz Diefenbach's Die V\u00f6lkst\u00e4mme d. Europ\u00e4ische Turkie; Mr. E. Arnold's \"Simple Transliteration of the Turkish Language;\" and F. L. Hopkins' \"Elementary Grammar of the Turkish Language.\"\n\nCypriote.\u2014The interpretation of the Cypriote inscriptions is advancing, and several books have been published and papers written about them during the last eighteen months. Of these we may mention Mr. Hall's Essay on the Cypriote Inscriptions of the Cesnola Collection in New York; papers by Mr. Sayce in the Boll. Italiano, and by Messrs. Birch, Fox Talbot, and Pierides in the Journal of Biblical Arch\u00e6ology; the Atti della R. Acad. d. Scienze di Torino, vol. xi. 1871; and a paper by M. Clermont Ganneau, \"Sur le Tresor le Curium.\" Dr. Moritz Schmidt of Jena has made a collection of these Inscriptions; M. Leon Rodet has contributed to the Revue de Philologie, an \"Essai sur le d\u00e9chiffrement des Inscriptions pretendues Anariennes de l'Ile de Chypre;\" and General Palma di Cesnola has published a paper entitled\n\"Scavi nell' Isola di Cipro,\" which was originally read before the \"Classe di Scienze morali,\" etc., at Turin.\n\nSemitic Literature.\u2014Hebrew.\u2014The first part of the Catalogue of the University Library at Cambridge has been published by Dr. Schiller Szinessy; and Prof. Graetz has now completed with his second volume the History of the Jews up to 1848; and the Rabbi Weiss has brought out (in Hebrew) his second volume of the History of Rabbinical Literature, comprising the period from the destruction of the Second Temple to the close of the Mishna, A.D. 189; his second volume being, however, a compilation, and, therefore, less original than his preceding one.\n\nThe publication of a collection of the late Dr. Geiger's minor articles, as well as of Dr. Zunz's scattered papers, is progressing.\n\nDr. Gudemann has contributed from Talmudical sources an essay on St. Matthew's Logia; and an important book on Hebrew mythology, which will be shortly published in an English dress, has been issued by Dr. Goldziher, a young professor at Buda-Pesth. Dr. Levy's Talmudical Lexicon has reached the letter Pi, and to Mr. Reginald Lane Poole we are indebted for a translation of Dr. Land's Hebrew grammar, which will prove of much value to philologists.\n\nTo Dr. Ginsburg we owe an able paper \"On the Babylonian Codex of Hosea and Job\" of the tenth century, now at St. Petersburg (Bibl. Arch\u00e6ol. v.), and to Dr. A. Lowy a very curious paper \"On a unique Specimen of the Lishman Shal Ivani, the modern Syriac or Targum Dialect of the Jews of Kurdistan and adjacent countries; with some account of the people by whom it is spoken\" (Bibl. Arch\u00e6ol. iv. 1). This paper contains the first chapter of Genesis, and three verses of the second, with the Institution of the Sabbath, as written down for him by a Jew of Salmao near Urmish, and represents the dialect still in use among the Jews of that\npart of Asia. Lishana Shal Imrani, or Lishanah Imrani, means \"the language of the inhabitants.\"\n\nM. Jellenek has also published a work entitled Jedidjah Salomo; being a preface to the Masoretic Commentary on the Bible by Norzi; a work originally completed so early as 1626, but not published till 1742.\n\nIn Palaeography much more has been done. Thus M. Renan has published in the Journal Asiatique for August-September, a Hebrew Inscription found by M. Guerin at the village of Alma in Galilee; and M. Philippe Berger has given an account in the same Journal of certain sacred stones, called by the Ph\u0153nicians Necib-Malak-Baal. M. Renan compares his inscription with one discovered at the Synagogue of Kefr Bereim, which was published by him in 1864, and thinks its date may be of the third or fourth century. The squareness of the characters, however, suggests a date considerably later.\n\nThe memoirs of the Academy of St. Petersburg for this year contain an elaborate essay by Dr. Harkavy on the colophons of the Pentateuch rolls in the Library of St. Petersburg, and on the tomb inscriptions found in the Crimea. That the former are genuine, can hardly now be maintained; but it required some labour and acumen to prove M. Firkovich, the collector of these documents, a Karaite Simonides. Dr. Harkavy has, however, completely shown this, detecting, as he has done, step by step, the various additions and corrections made in these Inscriptions. Thus the early Inscription presumed to be of 6 B.C. is now brought down to the eleventh or twelfth century; and the history of an early Jewish (or rather Karaitic, according to M. Firkovich's theory) settlement in the Crimea is shown to have existed only in the imagination of that ingenious collector.\n\nM. Neubauer, Sub-Librarian of the Bodleian, who visited the Russian capital last autumn for this purpose, has, in a letter to the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford, given a brief but clear account of the Hebrew-Arabic and Hebrew MSS.\nprocured from M. Firkovich, and now in the Imperial Library at St. Petersburg. The second collection\u2014the earlier one was secured in 1863\u2014consists of more than 1000 separate volumes, collected apparently from the Karaites synagogues in Egypt and at Hit in Mesopotamia. Among these are a large number of Pentateuch Rolls and of Biblical MSS., the oldest of the latter being dated A.D. 913-933.\n\nOther works completed or in progress are the following:\n\nMakkoth, Fr.\u2014Migdal Chananai. Ueber Leben und Schriften R. Chananels in Kairvan.\n\nMoritz, E.\u2014Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Judischen Philosophen des Mittel Alters. 1 Abth.\n\nFrensdorff, Prof.\u2014Die Massora Magna, nach den \u00e4ltesten drucken mit zu zieheng \u00e4lte MSS.\n\nLuzzato, S.

Frankfort.\n\nKohn, S.\u2014Zur Sprache, Literatur und dogmatik der Samariter. Leipzig.\n\nArabic.\u2014France has been particularly active in this branch of Eastern learning during the past year. Thus, M. Leclerc has completed his history of medicine among the Arabs: while the translation by M. Sauvaire of the fragments of \"Mujir-ed-din,\" relating to the history of Hebron and Jeru-\nsalem, is an important contribution to the geography of Palestine. Written in A.D. 1494, it naturally tells us nothing new of the early history of those places, but, with exception of what has been quite recently discovered, it is the real and only authority for all we know about the Tomb of Hebron. At the same time it should be remembered, that M. Sauvaire does not pretend that his work is a complete edition of his author; his object having been, chiefly, to offer to the many visitors to the Holy Land a book of instruction, and one, at the same time, pleasant to read.\n\nWe may add, also, here, M. de Saulcy's most recent and useful book \"Dictionnaire topographique de la Terre Sainte;\" and M. Clermont Ganneau's \"Palestine inconnu,\" in which he has for the first time applied, for the illustration of Old Palestine, data acquired from Musalman sources, oral traditions, and the manners and customs of the present Fellahin; M. Machuel's \"Une premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e d'Arabe \u00e0 l'usage des classes \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires d'Algerie;\" and M. Marc's \"Abd-Nameh d'Omar:\" M. Lavoix has, also, published a small pamphlet entitled \"Les peintures Arabes,\" in which he has shown that the world has formed a somewhat exaggerated notion of the extent of the Muhammadan aversion to the Plastic arts; and M. Boucher has far advanced with his publication of Ferazdak, one of the oldest Arabic poets. The value of this work is that it places before us a complete mirror of Arab life, so early as the times of the Ommiades. Lastly, M. Guyard has handled, at great length, in two numbers of the Journal Asiatique, the whole of the metrical system of the Arabs, a labour, essentially scientific, and of the highest value for those who are desirous of sounding the innermost depths of Arabian Philology.\n\nIn Germany we may notice some grammatical notes by Prof. Fleischer\u2014a paper for the most part engaged in pointing out certain errors and defects in Prof. Trumpp's Ajr\u00famiyyah\n(see Deuts. Morg. Ges. xxx. 3, pp. 487-513); Dr. Jahn's edition of Ibn Yaish's Commentary on the Mufassil of Zamakhshari; and Prof. Sachau's publication of the first part of Albiruni's treatise on the Chronology of Oriental Nations for our own Oriental Translation Fund. M. A. Muller has edited the fourth edition of Caspari's Arabische Grammatik, incorporating, at the same time, many of the additions and rectifications of Prof. W. Wright; and M. D. H. M\u00fcller the Kitab-al-Fark by 'Alagm\u0101l, from a MS. at Vienna.\n\nIn England we have an issue of a new edition of Mr. Rodwell's accurate translation of the Kor\u00e1n, and Prof. E. H. Palmer has completed his excellent work the Beha-ed-din, by an elegant translation in English verse. To Capt. Pridoux we are indebted for a valuable \"Sketch of Sabean Grammar\" (Bibl. Arch. v.).\n\nThe following would seem to be among the more important works or papers bearing on Arabic subjects published during the last year:\n\nSedillot.\u2014Hist. G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Arabes.

Ital.\n\nTwo Arabic newspapers have been published in London during the last six months, the Maratu'l Ahw\u00e1l by Mr. Hassoun, and An-N\u00e1hlah by Mr. Sabunji.\n\nIn connexion with Arabic, though not, of course, because they are cognate languages, this will, perhaps, be the best place to notice two remarkable works that have appeared from the French press with reference to the Berber tribes of North Africa. The first, by M. Mercier, is entitled \"Histoire de l'Etablissement des Arabes en l'Afrique Septentrionale\"; the second, by M. Fournel, \"Les Berbers; Etude sur la Conqu\u00eate d'Afrique par les Arabes, d'apr\u00e8s les textes Arabes imprim\u00e9s,\" tome i. The value of these works is that they enable us to see that the Arabic of the northern provinces of Algiers, Tunis, and Morocco, is a deposit simply overlying the surface of the previous and really original Berber. It is quite certain now, thanks to the able researches of these two French scholars,\nthat the Arabization of Africa falls under two distinct phases; the first, the conquest of the seventh century, followed, as this was, by an occupation of the country alike difficult and precarious, a period when the population remained essentially Berber, and adopted scarcely anything from their conquerors but the elements of the Musulman religion; the second, the invasion by the tribes of Hilal and Soleym in the eleventh century, which introduced into Africa an Arab race as a distinct element of the population of that continent. To this invasion, which gradually insinuated a purely Arab population into the valleys of the north, combined with a continual advance to the west, is mainly due the imposition on the indigenous Berbers of the manners and language of the Khalifa. No doubt that result was greatly aided by the direct action of the Khalif Mostanser, who, in A.D. 1049, cleared the neighbourhood of Barka, Ifrikiya, etc., of some 200,000 families, driving them, with their wives, children and flocks, into the western and southern highlands of Atlas. The two works of M. Mercier and of M. Fournel may be considered supplementary, the one to the other. It should be added that the latter clearly demonstrates that the industrious, hardworking Kabyles are the genuine descendants of the original Berbers. As bearing on this subject, it may be noted, that M. Reboud has published a collection of Latin and Berber Inscriptions (under the title of Recueil des Inscr. Libyco-Berb\u00e8res), and that General Faidherbe has shown much skill in their interpretation, proving satisfactorily that the Berber race of old had much real cultivation. It will be remembered that Mr. Francis Newman, twenty-nine years ago, in the pages of the Journal of this Society, first called attention to the value of the study of the Berber dialects.\n\nSyria.\u2014The most curious work that has been published is a German translation, by Prof. Bickell, of \"Kalilag und Damnag,\" an old Syrian version of this ancient Indian\ntale. As Prof. Benfey has pointed out, the original is an almost literal translation from the Pehlevi, which is itself translated from the Sanskrit Pantshatantra, the originals of both of which are now lost. The Arabic translation from the Pehlevi has many interpolations. Prof. Bickell has also published a second volume of the works of Isaac of Antiochia; and Prof. Noldeke has given a notice of this book in the D. M. G., vol. xxx. p. 3. Besides these, we may notice an article by Dr. Nesle on the punctuation of Syriac, D. M. G., vol. xxx. p. 3.\n\nHimyaritic and \u00c6thiopic.\u2014In Himyaritic, M. D. M\u00fcller has written a paper on Four Unedited Himyaritic Inscriptions in the British Museum, with reference, also, to eight others obtained from Capt. Miles, and eleven from Mr. Rehatsek (D. M. G. vol. xxx. p. 4). Dr. M\u00fcller adds some remarks on two Inscriptions published by M. Mordtmann, and has further attempted the decipherment of the Harran (i.e. Haur\u00e1n) Inscription procured by M. Wetzstein.\n\nIn \u00c6thiopic, Mr. G. H. Schodde has published Herma Nabi, an \u00c6thiopic version of the \"Pastor Hermas,\" and M. Antoine D'Abbadie has read a paper in the Acad. des Inscr., on an Inscription originally published by Ruppell.\n\nInscriptions.\u2014Much has been done in the interpretation of old and in the acquisition of new inscriptions during the past year. In Germany, Messrs. Kautsch and Socin have conclusively shown that the so-called Moabite Inscriptions on the pottery acquired for the Museum at Berlin are, without exception, gross forgeries; these conclusions having, indeed, been already fully borne out by the personal researches of M. Clermont Ganneau, whose practical knowledge prevented him from the first from being a dupe of the designing forgers of Jerusalem. Mr. Euting has also published a useful little work entitled \"Semitische Schrift-tafel,\" Strassburg, 8vo. 1877.\nIn France, great success has attended the search for Punic inscriptions, chiefly, as might have been anticipated, in the towns of the interior of Africa. Thus, from a necropolis near Constantine, M. Costa has sent not less than one hundred paper impressions; and the vast collections of M. Ste. Marie from Carthage, amounting to no less than two thousand six hundred individual inscriptions, are now available for publication, and will ere long see the day under the auspices of the \"Commission des Inscriptions S\u00e9mitiques.\" M. de Ste. Marie has lately offered to the Institute twelve volumes of such impressions, and as these are all in duplicate, many in triplicate, the loss of some of the originals by the blowing up of the Magenta, in Toulon roads, will not prove as serious to Science as was at one time feared.\n\nAssyria.\u2014The loss of Mr. George Smith, whose untimely death took place at Aleppo, during the last summer, has thrown a temporary gloom over Assyrian pursuits; but, though actual authoritative excavations have been for a time suspended, chiefly by the refusal of a firman to M. Hormuzd Rassam, and there might thus have been some fear that these studies would be arrested by the want of a fresh supply of original documents, it must, on the other hand, be recollected that a great mass of material already collected still remains untranslated. Besides this, many \"sporadic\" excavations continue to be made from time to time, leading, as these have led, to the discovery of several thousand inscribed tablets, many of which will, probably, prove to be contributions to Babylonian literature, a branch of Cuneiform for which we have fewer documents than in the case of Assyria. Moreover, in no previous year, has so much been done for the publication of translations into English of new texts, or for the revision of others partially made known previously.\n\nThus, \"The Eleventh Tablet of the Izdubar Legends relating to the Deluge\" (Records of the Past, vol. vii.), by the\nlate Mr. Smith, has been printed, being the first of a series of papers he had hoped to write on this subject, and which was, in fact, being printed in England, at the very time he was dying. Nor has that veteran interpreter, Mr. Fox Talbot, been idle; as he has contributed to the Transactions of the Biblical Archaeological Society, a \"Commentary on the Deluge Tablets\" (iv. 1); a paper on \"A Tablet in the British Museum relating apparently to the Deluge\" (iv. 1); a notice of \"The Fight between Bell and the Dragon\" (v. 1); \"The Revolt in Heaven\" (Records of the Past, vii.); \"The Inscription of Nebuchadnezzar at Sen'kereh\" (ibid); \"A Prayer and a Vision\" (ibid); \"Inscription of Nebuchadnezzar at the Birs-i-Nimrud\" (ibid); and \"The Standard Inscription of Ashur-akh-bal\" (ibid).\n\nM. Jules Oppert has given four papers to \"Records of the Past,\" vol. vii.: \"The Annals of Sargon,\" \"On Three Assyrian Deeds,\" \"The Median Version of the Inscription at Behistun,\" and \"Susian Texts:\" he has, also, written a paper in the Monatschr. of Berlin, Feb. 1877, entitled \"Inscription en langue Sumerienne,\" and published a separate tract called \"Sumerien ou Accadien.\" 8vo. Paris. To the Revd. W. Houghton we are indebted for two curious papers \"On the Mammalia of the Assyrian Sculptures\" in the Trans. Bibl. Arch\u00e6ol. v. and vi.; and to the Revd. J. M. Rodwell for a translation of the Bull Inscription of Nebuchadnezzar (Records, vol. vii.).\n\nMr. W. St. Chad Boscawen has shown his ability as a translator in several texts recently published, one of the most curious of which is \"An early Chaldaean Inscription\" (Bibl. Arch\u00e6ol. iv. 1.), written in Assyrian, but a translation of an early Accadian text, the colophon stating that it was copied for Ashurbanipal, and placed in his palace. This inscription gives the names of five new Chaldaean kings, and throws much light on the religious feeling and ritual of the early Babylonians. With this notice, Mr. Boscawen comprehends several\ninteresting texts relating to the Temple of Bit Sagmatu at Babylon. Mr. Boscawen has, also, printed papers \"On the Legend of the Tower of Babel\" (the text and translation in Bibl. Arch\u00e6ol. vol. v., and the translation alone in \"Records,\" vol. vii.); a \"Historical Inscription of Esarhaddon (Bibl. Arch\u00e6ol., vol. v.)\"; and \"The Inscription of Aga-kak-rimi\" in the \"Records,\" vol. vii.\n\nMr. Sayce has contributed to the Trans. Bibl. Arch\u00e6ol. (vol. iv.) a remarkable paper \"On Human Sacrifices among the Babylonians,\" derived in part from an Accadian poem, to which an Assyrian translation has been affixed, and which, therefore, ascends to pre-Semitic times; and partly, from a tablet belonging to the Library of Sargon at Agane, of a date between B.C. 2000 and 1700\u2014together with a \"Revised translation of a passage in the great Astronomical work of the Babylonians\" (ibid.). He has, also, given three papers to \"Records of the Past,\" vol. vii.: the first, \"On Babylonian Moral and Political Precepts;\" the second, \"On an Accadian Penitential Psalm;\" the third, \"A Babylonian Saints' Calendar.\" To these may be added an able paper by Dr. Ginsburg, \"On a Babylonian Codex\" (Bibl. Arch. v. 2); an article by Mr. Sayce on Gutschmidt's \"Neue Beitr\u00e4ge zur Geschichte des alten Orients\" in Boll. Ital. p. 102; and a letter, also, by Mr. Sayce, \"On the Geography of N. Syria,\" Acad., 1876, p. 454; M. Halevy's \"Recherches critiques sur l'origine de la civilisation Babyloniennne,\" Paris, 8vo. 1877; a valuable work by M. Lenormant, intitled \"Etude sur quelques parties des syllabaires Cun\u00e9iformes\"; and M. Delitzsch's \"Chald\u00e4ische Genesis\"\u2014a translation of Mr. George Smith's work, with abundant corrections and some additional matter.\n\nMr. Sayce has given three very interesting Lectures in the theatre of the Royal Institution in April and May of the present year \"On Babylonian Literature.\" In the first of these, he gave a sketch of the history of the decipherment of the Cuneiform inscriptions\u2014of the discovery of Ashurbanipal's library\nat Nineveh\u2014of the libraries founded in Babylonia by the pre-Semitic Accadians\u2014and by Sargon, the great early monarch of Agane. He then showed that the library of Nineveh consisted very largely of translations into Assyrian of Accadian tablets brought from S. Babylonia and Chald\u00e6a, and noticed the arrangement of the Ninevite Library. Mr. Sayce then showed that the historical life of Assyria rested on a basis of Chronology, which was really sure, and, in principle, not unlike that of the Archon-system at Athens, each year being marked by, the name of an Eponymus, the earliest yet traced being that of B.C. 909: with regard to the distinction to be drawn between Accad and Sumir (or Shinar), Mr. Sayce held that the former were the people of the highlands, the latter of the plains\u2014Izdubar and Zisuthrus being, at least provisionally, identifiable with Nimrod and Noah.\n\nIn his second lecture, Mr. Sayce pointed out certain marked features of distinction between the Assyrians and Babylonians, the first being a people in all things essentially practical, the second naturally fond of the dreams and fancies of poetry; and discussed, at some length, the \"Legends of the Flood,\" and their remarkable resemblance, even in matters of detail, to the Bible-story. Mr. Sayce then alluded to the Tower of Babel, and the local legend that what was built up by day was blown down at night; to the Accadian account of the Creation, and to the remarkable similarity between the earliest Greek legends, and the still more remote Chald\u00e6an stories; together with the curious story of the descent of Ishtar into Hades. It was clear, he added, that the early myths of Southern Babylonia had largely influenced the mythology of later nations, and had, in fact, been handed on through Ph\u0153nician, Jew and Greek, even to the North of Europe. With regard to the date of the earliest writings, Mr. Sayce considered the hymns the eldest, though much of what has come down to us was evidently of a period when many, if not most of these had been forgotten. The Accadian religion he showed was originally Shamanism,\nwith an abundant use of sorcery and of charms; the powers of evil being looked upon in the light of inferior deities. Bloody Moloch was not, as had been supposed, of Semitic origin, but derived from the Accadians. Hence, too, the Gnostic charms and symbols, the belief in witches, ancient and modern, and in the Evil Eye.\n\nIn his third lecture, Mr. Sayce entered very fully into the history of Babylonian Science, showing that though much elementary work had been previously accomplished by the Accadians, Babylon may be fairly considered the true inventress of Mathematics and Astronomy. To the Accadians we owe the earliest unit, 60; the invention of an almanac; the signs of the Zodiac, from which the months were named; and the arrangement and number of the days of the week, 7 being with them, as long subsequently, a Sacred Number. The Accadian system was, however, astrological rather than astronomical, the wish of the people being rather to discern the future than to describe the present. On the other hand, the Babylonians looked to practical work and knowledge; hence celestial observatories in all their chief cities, with formal reports sent in every two months. Comets, the conjunction of the Sun and Moon, and the true position of the Pole Star were recognized; the Milky Way detected; and an attempt, even, made to form a planisphere, the Equator being divided into 240 parts. The Babylonians, Mr. Sayce added, were clearly law-lovers. Royal judges were appointed, no bribes permitted, while the State looked after the slave and his children, slaves being recognized as having some rights. The mother ranked first; the denial of a mother's request involving heavy punishment, while, in the case of the father, this could be condoned for by a simple penalty. Both father and mother were punishable for neglecting their children.\n\nTaxes were levied from burgheers and strangers. Under the late Assyrian Empire, large sums were obtained from the dependent Satrapies; while the country at large paid a regular\nfixed tax. Thus Nineveh paid 30 talents; Carchemish, 100; Megiddo, 15. The manah was, after the capture of Carchemish, the accepted standard. A great banking firm existed at Babylon, and was carried on from father to son for five successive generations\u2014indeed, out-lived the capture of Babylon. Bank holidays were regularly kept. In conclusion, Mr. Sayce stated that a work on Agriculture had been met with, fixing three seasons for the farmer, and stating that the tenant was entitled to two-thirds of the produce, one-third being reserved for the owner. And further, that the state of education in those ancient days was quite comparable with that of much more modern times. The young Assyrian was compelled to study his own language, and, in some cases, Accadian also. The schools were, generally, open, and libraries abundant.\n\nPh\u0153nician.\u2014Dr. Euting has advanced the study of Ph\u0153nician by more than one article in the Trans. of the Germ. Orient. Society; and Dr. O. Blau has given a paper in the same Transactions, called \"Ph\u00f6nikische Analecten;\" a paper has also been read before the \"Acad. d. Inscriptions\" by M. Renan, on fragments of vases found in Cyprus bearing on them archaic Ph\u0153nician letters.\n\nArmenian.\u2014M. Gutschmid has published a valuable essay, Ueber die glaubw\u00fcrdigkeit d. Armenische geschichte d. Moses von Khoren; Dr. Dervischjan, a Journal on matters Armenian, entitled Armeniaca I.; and M. Patkavoda, \"Investigations into the Armenian Language,\" in Russ.\n\nMaltese.\u2014M. Sandreeski has given in the D. M. G. vol. xxx. p. 4, an excellent paper, \"Die Maltesische Mundart,\" in which he shows how curiously the Maltese spoken dialect is made up from the languages of neighbouring nations, its base being Semitic.\n\nEgyptology.\u2014The last year has been a busy one with the\nEgyptologists, the number of valuable papers read and printed affording good evidence as to the number of scholars now devoting themselves to this branch of Oriental study, and to the activity with which they have worked. To Dr. Birch we owe three papers in the Trans. Bibl. Arch. One on \"The Tablet of Antepas II.\", with a curious disquisition on the dogs of ancient Egypt, and on the pack belonging to that ruler (iv.) ; on the \"Unrolling of a Mummy at Stafford House\" (v.) ; and \"On an Inscription of a Darius in the Temple at El-Khargeh\" (v.), together with five articles in \"Records of the Past,\"\u2014as \"The Praise of Learning\" (viii.) ; a \"Decree from Canopus\" (ibid.) ; \"Inscription from the gold mines of Rhedesieh and Kuban\" (ibid.) ; \"The great Harris Papyruses\" in conjunction with M. Eisenlohr (ibid.) ; and the translation of the \"Inscription of Darius from El-Khargeh\" before alluded to.\n\nM. Lefebure has contributed a paper to the Trans. Bibl. Archaeol. (iv.) \"On the four races at the last Judgment,\" taken from the Sarcophagus of Seti I., and published by Messrs. Sharpe and Bonomi, with emendations by M. Pierrat; the chief object of the paper being to show the remarkable analogy that exists between Egyptian and Christian views on that subject. And M. Naville has given a paper to the same Journal\u2014which is published in the same volume as the last\u2014on \"The Distinction of Men by the Gods,\" from a mythological inscription on the tomb of the same monarch at Thebes, and also one \"On the Litany of Ra\" in \"Records of the Past\" (viii.). M. Elers in the Trans. of the German Oriental Society (xxx. 3), and M. Chabas in the Acad. des Inscriptions, have given many interesting details with reference to the remarkable hieroglyphical inscriptions, discovered by the former at Abd-al-Kurneh, a well-known portion of the Necropolis at Thebes. M. Chabas has also described \"An Egyptian Stele in the Museum at Turin.\" Prof. Lushington has contributed two papers to \"Records of the Past\" (viii.), one entitled \"Hymn to Ra-Harmachis;\" the other, \"Fragment of\nthe first Sallier Papyrus\"; while Mr. Le Page Renouf has contributed to the same work \"Abstracts of a case of Conspiracy;\" M. Brugsch Bey, \"The great Mendes St\u00e8le;\" and M. Deveria, \"The Papyrus of Moral Precepts\" (all in vol. viii.).\n\nM. Eug\u00e8ne Revilhout has made a very important discovery, and one likely to lead to others. Two years ago the National Library at Paris purchased a MS. in the Demotic character with five columns on the first page and several more on the back in a different hand. M. Revilhout found out that it really commences with the sixth chapter of a Chronicle, similar to that of Manetho, and goes down to the thirteenth chapter. It treats of the period between the years B.C. 410 and B.C. 345, comprises three dynasties and about ten princes, and throws some light on the period when the Greeks were the allies of the Egyptians against the Persians. M. Revilhout has read a paper on this discovery before the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions, entitled \"Une Chronique Egyptienne contemporaine de Manethon.\" M. Maspero has also written a paper \"On the Name of an Egyptian Dog\" (Bibl. Arch\u00e6ol. v.).\n\nM. Lauth has contributed to the Sitzungs-berichte of the Academy of Munich a notice of Horapollo, in which he reconsiders the nature of this work, and highly praises an early work by Prof. Leemans, \"Hieropollinis Niloi Hieroglyphica, Amstel., 1835.\" He adds much interesting matter, and many corrections, due to the widely increased knowledge of Hieroglyphics during the last forty years. M.

Lepsius and Brugsch, in which are many able articles by Dr. Birch, Prof. Noldeke, M. Kabis, MM. Goodwin, Naville, Golenischeff, and the Rev. D. H.

Mus.) \u00fcbersetzt und erkl\u00e4rt.\n\nOf the Societies, which devote more or less of their time\nand resources to the development of Oriental literature, we must notice, first, that of Biblical Archaeology.\n\nThis Society has continued its active and successful labours during the last year, and has published two parts, making up vol. v., the value and cost of which may be estimated from the variety of texts published, and the number of special types required for this purpose. The principal papers contained in this volume have been noticed under their respective heads. At the same time, it can hardly be denied that the Assyrian researches of Messrs. Talbot, Sayce, Oppert and others would be more appropriately given to the Meetings or the Journal of this Society.\n\nUnder the patronage of the Society of Biblical Archeology, the elementary classes for the study of the Assyrian and Egyptian languages have been continued, during this, the third Session, by the kind and gratuitous labours of Mr. St. Chad Boscawen, and of Mr. Le Page Renouf. These classes have been well attended, and many promising students have been successfully carried over the threshold of the study of these recondite languages. It is but reasonable to hope, that one result of the Commission appointed by Parliament to consider the advisability of a partial redistribution of the revenues of Oxford and Cambridge, will be the creation of new Professorial chairs for branches of Oriental learning, which can hardly be said to have hitherto received any adequate recognition or support. Oxford and Cambridge will, in this respect, wisely follow the good example set by many of the small and poorly endowed Universities on the Continent.\n\nThe path of students in the pursuit of these ancient and still obscure languages has been, of late, considerably smoothed, and to an extent fully intelligible by those who had originally to decipher mutilated tablets of stone or clay without the aid of Grammar, Dictionary or Syllabary, by the continued publication of these useful little volumes\u2014\"The Records of the\nPast\u201d\u2014two of which, the 7th and 8th, have been recently issued. In these, excellent English translations (to which allusion has already been made) will be found of many or most of the more important texts.\n\nPersian.\u2014There have been several works or papers recently published, of great interest and value, relating to this language. Of these the following may be specified:\n\nA small edition in 12mo., vols. 1 and 2, of Firdusi\u2019s \u201cLivre des Rois,\u201d by Madame Mohl.\n\nMir Abd\u2019ul Kerim Boukhary\u2019s \u201cHistoire de l\u2019Asie centrale,\u201d A.D. 1740\u20131818, translated and edited by M. Schefer.\n\nParthaen und Pehlav, Mada und Mah, by J. Olshausen.\n\nAllegories, recits populaires traduits de l\u2019Arabe, du Persan, de l\u2019Hindoustani et du Turc, par M. Gar\u00e7in de Tassy.\n\nConcise Dictionary of the Persian Language, by Prof. E. H. Palmer.\n\nAnvar-i Sohaili, by Mr. A. N. Wollaston.\n\nAvesta, Livre Sacr\u00e9 des Sectateurs de Zoroastre, the first translation in French. By M. C. de Harlez.\n\nRaccolti Epici del libro dei Re di Firdusi, by Prof. Pizzi.\n\nM. A. O. Mordtmann has, also, contributed to the Sitzungsber. of the Academy of Munich, a valuable paper \u201cOn the Comparative Geography of Persia,\u201d in which he discusses very fully what is now known of Ancient Media.\n\nIn the same Sitzungsberichte, M. Chodzko has replied to Prof. Trumpp\u2019s views \u201cOn the Accentuation of Persian.\u201d\n\nSociety for Promoting Christian Knowledge.\u2014During the last year this Society has issued several works, which, though not all, strictly, Oriental, are deserving of record here, as showing the zeal with which the study of languages is promoted by Societies whose chief business is the furthering of Missionary exertions. Thus in Turkish, a tract \u201cOn the Death of Christ\u201d has been published, and the translation of the\nEnglish Prayer Book is in preparation. In Chinese, a primer in the Hangkow dialect, with a key, and a translation of Bishop Russell's sermons into the Ningpo dialect have also been issued. Many other works, of use to others as well as missionaries, have been prepared and are now ready; as, for instance, a portion of the Prayer Book in Russ, a Grammar and several minor works in the Cree language, and parts of the Prayer Book in Chippewa, a key to the Gospels in Maori, and several books in dialects of the African tongues, as Zulu, Swahili, Motu, etc., together with \"Family Prayers\" in Armenian. In connexion with this subject, we may add, that, though, at present, there has been no adequate successor to Dr. Bleek, to whom the credit is justly due of having been among the first to systematize the African languages, Bishop Steere has had much success with the Swahili, and has published a handbook, the accuracy of which practice has confirmed. The dialects of which he has printed something are the Rjas, the Nyanwegi, the Shambula, and the Makonde, all curiously different from one another, though preserving the same general lines of formation. Thus the Rjas has four forms of the future, while the Mukonde, its close neighbour, has none at all. Bishop Steere has promised to send copies of all his books to our Library.\n\nWe may add that it is now nearly an accepted fact that Malagasi (of which a grammar has recently been published by M. Marr\u00e9 de Marin, with the title \"Grammaire Malgache fond\u00e9e sur les principes de la grammaire Javanaise\") is a Malay language from Sumatra, and that its connexion with the African Swahili is only that of loan-words, just as Persian has borrowed largely from Arabic. The Rev. Mr. Cousins, an excellent Malagasi scholar, who is at present occupied in translating the Bible, read a paper on this subject during last autumn before the Philological Society.\n\nThe British and Foreign Bible Society.\u2014This Society, as in former years, so in the last, has increased its magnificent\nrepertorium of translations into the languages of Asia. We can hardly sufficiently appreciate the advantage to unsettled language, of such operations. Recently, the attention of the Society has been chiefly given to the languages of Azaral-Armenian, Osmanli and Trans-Caucasian Turkish, Georgian, Persian, Pushtu, Sindhi, Santhali, and Mendari, on the Continent of Asia; and to Balinese and Batta, in the Islands of the Archipelago. Up to the present time this Society can exhibit the whole Bible, or parts of it, in no less than 212 independent idioms.\n\nPhilological Society.\u2014This Society has continued the promise of good linguistic work shadowed forth in last year's report; and has issued three papers directly bearing upon Oriental subjects. These are, that by M. Pavet de Courteille, \"On the existing state of our knowledge of the Turkish Language;\" that by M. L\u00e9on de Rosny, \"On the Japanese Language;\" and that by Mr. Robert Cust, \"On the Languages of the Indo-Chinese Peninsula and the Indian Archipelago.\" During the past year, also, papers have been read by Dr. Rieu, the Keeper of the Oriental MSS. at the British Museum, \"On Persian Phonetics;\" by Mr. E. L. Brandreth, \"On the Classification of the Non-Aryan Languages of India;\" by Mr. R. B. Swinton, \"On Common Tamil,\" and by the Rev. A. H. Sayce, \"On Accadian Phonology.\"\n\nGeneral Philology.\u2014A valuable new work was commenced in the summer of last year, entitled Bolletino Italiano, under the able editorship of M. A. de Gubernatis. It has been since issued twice in the month, and has been the medium for the publication of many important notices of Oriental works.\n\nAnother useful and recent work, of which three parts only have as yet been issued, is M. A. Bezzenberger's \"Beitr\u00e4ge zur kunde der Indo-Germanischen Sprachen.\" Besides this,\nit may be stated that M. Fleck has completed his Vergleichendes W\u00f6rterbuch der Indo-Germanischen Sprachen; that M. Br\u00e9al has given an interesting essay in the Journal des Savants, \"Examen critique de quelques th\u00e9ories relatives \u00e0 la langue m\u00e8re Indo-Europ\u00e9enne;\" that Prof. Rhys has published a letter in the Academy \"On Aryan Palatal Consonants in Teutonic Languages;\" and that the second part of Schleicher's \"Compendium,\" translated by Mr. Bendall, has been published.\n\nOriental Congress of 1876.\u2014The most important event of the last year was the Meeting at St. Petersburg of the Third Oriental Congress, which took place in the early part of September, and was a complete success. It was not, on the whole, thought advisable that this Society should send to it any special delegates, the more so, as neither our President, or Director, or Sir Walter Elliot, were able to go there, but our Honorary Secretary and Librarian took some part in its proceedings, having been elected Vice-Presidents of the sections of Religious Sects and of the Caucasus, respectively.\n\nThe advantage of such meetings can, indeed, hardly be over-estimated, consisting as this does, not only in the interest of the subjects discussed, but in the opportunities offered of personal intercourse between the representatives of different countries. It is true that, in St. Petersburg, the difficulty of the local language diminished considerably the advantages derivable from the public readings and discussions; and that, though Russ, French, German, English, and Latin, were used indiscriminately, there was, naturally, a considerable preponderance of the first, so that it may be doubted whether, even up to this date, in spite of the able r\u00e9sum\u00e9s in French published daily, any member of the Congress is fully aware of what was said in his hearing; nor, indeed, will this knowledge be obtained till the French report, now in course of publication by Mr. Brill, at Leiden, is issued from the press.\nThe next Congress is to be held at Florence in the September of 1878, under the presidency of Signor Amari. At this Congress it has been formally announced that a prize of 5000 lire will be given by the Minister of Public Instruction \"al miglior lavoro sulle vicende della Civilt\u00e0 Aria nell' India.\" The Director and Honorary Secretary of this Society have been requested to act as its agents in England.\n\nNumismatics.\u2014There is comparatively little to record under this head; but it may be stated that the valuable collection of the late Colonel Guthrie, R.E., has been finally purchased en blocque by the Imperial Government of Germany, and that there is some hope that a catalogue of it will be soon published by that able scholar, Prof. Pertsch, to whom its acquisition by Germany is largely due.\n\nIn the Journal of the Germ. Orient. Soc. Dr. Mordtmann has published an interesting memoir, entitled \"Die Dynastie der Danischmende,\" a small Muhammadan dynasty in the Eastern part of Asia Minor during the twelfth century, some of the coins of which are curious, as having double Inscriptions in Greek and Arabic. Mr. S. L. Poole has, also, issued \"Unpublished Coins of the K\u0101kweyhis;\" and \"Inedited Arabic Coins\" (second and third notices). The publication of what is called \"The International Numismata Orientalia,\" or the \"New Marsden,\" is proceeding satisfactorily. The portions undertaken by Mr. Barclay V. Head and Mr. E. T. Rogers are finished; and those by Mr. Percy Gardner and Mr. Rhys Davids are in type.\n\nM. Tiesenhausen has published in a Boll. Italiano two letters; the first giving a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of numismatic work for the last year, and the second an account of the numismatic studies of Don Francisco Codera y Zaidin, who has published some able numismatic essays on Arabic coins in different Spanish journals; and Sir E. Clive Bayley, in the Indian Antiquary, No. 65, some excellent Notes on Gupta Coins, in which he\nshows that Dr. B\u00fchler has now been able to elucidate several points heretofore doubtful. He has, also, added some useful remarks on the eras to be adopted for coins of this class.\n\nLastly, in the Numismatic Chronicle, Mr. B. V. Head has printed an exhaustive memoir \"On the Coinage of Lydia and of Persia.\"\n\nAt the conclusion of the reading of the Report, the President of the Society, Sir Edward Colebrooke, called on Professor Monier Williams to move the adoption of the Report, asking him at the same time to give some account of his recent visit to India.\n\nProfessor Monier Williams said,\u2014At our anniversary meeting last year, I stated some of the reasons for my first visit to India and some of the results of my travels. Surprise has been expressed that I should have made a second journey to India so soon after my first. I may, perhaps, be allowed to explain that, on the first occasion, I had only leave of absence for six months, and, on my return to Oxford, I soon discovered that the task I had set myself had not been completely accomplished. I found, in fact, that I only knew half of India; for the south is quite a different country from the north. I had been at Bombay and Calcutta during the Prince of Wales' visit, and had witnessed such sights as had never before been seen in India, and met such an assemblage of native princes as had never before been gathered together in one place; but I knew nothing of the other great capital city where our power was first established\u2014Madras.\n\nI had seen many celebrated temples, including those of Benares and Amritsar, but had never beheld a really typical Hindu temple either of Vishnu or \u015aiva\u2014I mean a temple of any real magnitude and imposing proportions, and complete in all its paraphernalia\u2014any specimen, in fact, of grand Indian Architecture, such as is only afforded by the Pagodas of the South.\npeople crowded through this strait and narrow passage for hours, following the idol borne in front amid deafening shouts and the sounds of all kinds of music. The passage of the earthly heaven's gate is supposed to be a passport to beatitude in Vish\u1e47u's heaven above.\n\nLet me next say a few words about Tanjore. Its temple has no interior encircling walls, but has an immense paved quadrangle\u2014far larger than that of Christ Church or Trinity College\u2014kept scrupulously clean, with a grove of palm-trees on one side. The central lingam-shrine has a colossal stone bull looking into it, and is surrounded by other detached temples of Ga\u1e47e\u015ba, Subrahma\u1e47ya and P\u0101rvat\u012b, all of them beautiful as specimens of Indian architecture. I should mention that Ga\u1e47e\u015ba and Subrahma\u1e47ya (the latter called Skanda or K\u0101rttikeya in Northern India) are both very favourite gods in the South. Ga\u1e47e\u015ba, however, is popular all over India. They are both sons of \u015aiva, and, in my opinion, the real reason for their popularity is their supposed power over the devils, who obstruct all undertakings. Ga\u1e47e\u015ba is usually called the god of Wisdom, but he is really the lord of the troops of devils, and Subrahma\u1e47ya is the martial god who defeats the demon armies. All round the quadrangle of the Tanjore temple is a kind of double cloister containing a row of 108 lingams of different sizes set up at regular intervals, and behind them frescoes representing \u015aiva's exploits.\n\nThe next temple I visited was that of Madura. It is a wonderful pile. There are two shrines in this temple, at the end of long corridors, presenting beautiful vistas of columns, one to \u015aiva, called Sundaresvara, and the other to a local goddess called M\u00edn\u00e1ch\u00ed (M\u00edn\u00e1ksh\u00ed), probably adopted by the \u0100ryans, and converted into \u015aiva's wife. She is said to have been the daughter of one of the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dya R\u0101jas, afterwards deified. She is the popular deity of this district, more popular than her husband, and Madura itself is often called M\u00edn\u00e1ch\u00edpur.\nPerhaps R\u0101me\u015bvaram is the most interesting temple of all. It is the Benares of Southern India. A longing to visit this place first took possession of me on reading, many years ago, Mr. Cusin's article, in the Calcutta Review, on the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a. I ought also to mention that Mr. Fergusson's last work on Indian Architecture was my constant companion during all my Indian journeys.\n\nWe had great difficulty in making our way in bullock bandies, through a sandy waste, first to R\u0101mn\u0101d, and thence to the island, at the further end of which the R\u0101me\u015bvaram temple stands surrounded by a small town.\n\nThe island is separated from the mainland by the P\u0101mben Channel, about a mile wide. The temple\u2014chiefly built by the Zamindars of R\u0101mn\u0101d\u2014is a splendid structure, with immense galleries or corridors surrounding the lingam-shrine. It is close to the sea-shore, overlooking the coral-reefs, called R\u0101ma-setu, R\u0101ma's bridge, separating India from Ceylon, and extending twenty-one miles to Manasar island.\n\nThe temple is not dedicated to R\u0101ma, but to \u015aiva, R\u0101ma himself having set up a lingam there and worshipped it on his return from Ceylon. A pilgrimage to Benares is not complete, unless followed by one to R\u0101me\u015bvaram. Pilgrims first journey to Vi\u015be\u015bvara (the \u015aiva-temple at Benares), fill jars with holy water from the Ganges, and then toil on foot, through dust and sand, 1200 miles, to R\u0101me\u015bvaram, where the Ganges water is poured over the lingam with the supposed certainty of securing beatitude hereafter.\n\nIt is remarkable that while our system of education is undermining the belief of a certain class of people in these miserable superstitions, our civilization, railways, and good government, by facilitating communication, order, and sanitary regulations at large religious gatherings, is increasing the number of pilgrims, and filling the pockets of the priests at places like R\u0101me\u015bvaram.\n\nThrough the kindness of Sir Richard Meade and Sir Salar\nJung, I visited Hyderabad and Ellora under most advantageous circumstances. Mr. Burgess was hard at work at Ellora, and I had the advantage of his guidance in examining the caves. For a comparison of Br\u00e1hmanism with Buddhism and Jainism, they are most instructive.\n\nI consider the Kail\u00e1sa temple, cut out of the solid rock, externally and internally, one of the wonders of the world\u2014perhaps the third sight of India, the Him\u00e1layas coming first, and the T\u00e1j at Agra second.\n\nWith regard to the sects, these, of course, received a large share of my attention. A large number of Br\u00e1hmans in the South say they belong to no sect at all, but call themselves Sm\u00e1rtas or followers of Smr\u00edt\u00ed, strict Br\u00e1hmanical tradition. They acknowledge \u0160ankar\u00e1c\u00e1rya as their leader, and are Advait\u00eds, that is, pure pantheists.\n\nThe great \u0160aiva sect of the South is that of the Lingaits\u2014a very important and increasing body of men. They were founded by Basava (=Vrishabha) in the twelfth century. He was a native of the Deccan. They reject caste and Br\u00e1hmanical authority and all idolatry except adoration of the Lingam, carried in a silver casket slung round their necks. They are also opposed to many Hind\u00fa usages, such as burning the dead.\n\nThe followers of R\u00e1m\u00e1nuja and Madhv\u00e1, the former of whom lived in the twelfth, and the latter in the thirteenth century, constitute the great Vaish\u1e47ava sects of Southern India. The R\u00e1m\u00e1nujas are split into two parties\u2014the Northern men called Vadagalais, and the Southern men called Tengalais. They differ very much as Arminians and Calvinists. The doctrine of the one is called the Monkey-hold system; that of the other, the Cat-hold system. In philosophy the R\u00e1m\u00e1nujas are Visi\u1e63\u1e6d\u00e1dvait\u00eds, half dualistic and half pantheistic. The M\u00e1dhvas are Dvait\u00eds, dualists.\n\nIt is evident that Vaish\u1e47avism and \u0160aivism are the very heart and soul of modern Hind\u00faism, and that they are to be found in their most pronounced and unmitigated form in\nSouthern India. In the North Hinduism has become more or less diluted by Muhammadanism and other influences. Nowhere in the north, not even at Benares, can be seen anything equal to the pagodas of Southern India.\n\nOne of my objects in my second journey was to inquire into the devil-worship prevalent in Southern India. All India labours more or less under what may be called Demonophobia, but the South is particularly so afflicted.\n\nSouthern India and Ceylon constitute the great devil region. Every village has its own devils (bh\u016bta, pishcha, preta), who inflict blight, drought, diseases, and evils of all kinds, to which afflictions every village is liable unless defended by its own tutelary deities (gr\u0101ma-devat\u0101h). All devils are thought to delight in dancing, especially if accompanied with violent gesticulations and wild cries. Hence, in popular belief, the devils of small-pox, cholera, or fever, will leave the persons of their victims and occupy those of the dancers, without inflicting harm on them. I witnessed such a dance one night in Ceylon. There were three dancers who personated the demons of three forms of typhus fever, carried flaring torches, and were dressed in grotesque costumes with hideous masks. Their wild shrieks and horrible antics will remain indelibly fixed on my memory. Devil-dancing, however, is not properly part of Buddhism.\n\nThe cold, negative, and sleepy character of the Buddhism of Ceylon struck me very forcibly as contrasted with the noisy demonstrative Hinduism of Southern India. Buddhism may be described as a kind of fine-weather religion suited only for summer days. In times of trouble the Sinhalese have recourse to the Hindu gods. At other times their only form of worship consists in bringing scented flowers and offering them before the images of Buddha.\n\nAnother object of my second visit to India was to investigate the comparative importance of the Dravidian languages. I was much impressed with the superiority of Tamil to Telugu.\nthough its written characters are defective. It is a vigorous language spoken by fifteen millions, and has a considerable literature independent of Sanskrit. Tamil and Telugu will probably in time swallow up Malayalam and Kanarese respectively. It is to be hoped that the Civil Service Commissioners will no longer make Telugu the only language compulsory on the selected candidates destined for Madras. I may mention that I found Sanskrit spoken as commonly and with as much fluency by Pandits in the South of India as in the North.\n\nAt Tanjore there is the finest Oriental library in all India, perhaps in all the world. There are about 1800 Sanskrit MSS., many of them written in the Telugu and Grantham characters, and many brought there by learned Pandits from the Marathi country, after the Marathis had conquered this part of India. It was here that I first made the personal acquaintance of Dr. Burnell, the well-known Sanskrit scholar, now judge of Tanjore, who is cataloguing the MSS. He has himself a valuable Sanskrit library, including a copy of all the Apastamba Sutras, probably the only complete collection that exists in one library.\n\nI may mention, in conclusion, that while in India I gained several new supporters of my Oxford Indian Institute scheme; among others, the Maharajas of Travancore and Darbhanga. I had a great accession in Mr. T. Brassey, M.P., who wrote to me from his yacht at Penang, during his voyage round the world, and promised me a munificent contribution. Also I received many additional petitions from natives and others for the founding of an Indian school for granting degrees in the University of Oxford. I am happy to notify that the Hebdomadal Council is likely to bring forward a proposal for the founding of such a school in the course of next term.\n\nLet me apologize for the unconscionable manner in which I have taken up your time.\nAt the conclusion of his speech, Prof. Williams formally moved, and Mr. L. Bowring seconded, the adoption of the Report.\n\nSir Edward Colebrooke then said\u2014Before putting the motion, I wish to express the satisfaction of myself and the Council that the Report has received the stamp of approbation which has been set upon it by Prof. Monier Williams, and I hope the statement which he has made will be printed with our publications, that it may have a wider circulation and be read by a larger number of persons than are now assembled, containing, as it does, so many interesting facts concerning the religious condition of the South of India, to which Prof. Williams' remarks chiefly refer. I wish also to remark that we have listened with satisfaction to the announcement that the University of Oxford has now matured the scheme, in which Prof. Williams takes so much interest, for the foundation of a school for special studies connected with India. The subject is, no doubt, attended with some difficulty, as it is mixed up with other considerations connected with the training of young men for the public service\u2014the age at which they should proceed to India, and the possibility of supplying at our universities a special training which may compete with professional tutors. Jealousy has already been excited by the recent changes, and it would be premature to give an opinion on a question which is likely to be discussed in Parliament. I will, however, express my hope that these difficulties may be overcome, and that the efforts now being made to make the University of Oxford a school of study for the East as well as the West, may be rendered available not only to the youths of these islands, but also to our native fellow-subjects.\n\nI am happy to state that our position as a society is, on the whole, satisfactory. The Report itself affords evidence of our literary activity, and the financial position of the Society is sound, though it can hardly be said\nto be prosperous; and we cannot afford to omit using every effort to add to our numbers, and to invite the co-operation of all who take an interest in the literature and antiquities of the East. It has not been possible, in the short time allotted to the reading of the Report, to give, in detail, the vast amount of work that is proceeding in all parts of the world, and which is very fully set forth. It is, undoubtedly, a matter of congratulation that we should find on all sides these signs of activity, accompanied, as it is, by something of regret that the work should be diffused through so many channels, that it loses much of its interest from the want of concentration. If the labours of the English-speaking societies only were embodied in a single publication, and their discussions carried on at one and the same meeting, the interest would be vastly increased, and a force would be given to our efforts which it would be difficult to calculate. This, however, cannot be. The republic of letters is too widely spread to admit of that, but, failing this, there may be such interchange of views through their works and correspondence as may make us feel that we are members of one great union, with common interests and pursuits; and further, that occasional opportunities should be afforded of meetings which admit of personal exchange of views. The latter object has been attained by those Oriental Congresses which have now been held in three of the principal Capitals of Europe, and promise to make the tour of the West. One thing seems to be wanting to the success of such gatherings, viz. that they should admit of some organization like that of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, and similar institutions, so as to insure a complete record of their proceedings, and some method in their work, so as to invite and encourage special investigations. I will not affirm that the proposal can assume an active shape, but it appears to me to deserve consideration.\n\nI feel more than ever convinced that there is a vast amount of work before us and that there was never a time\nwhen it was of more importance that accurate knowledge should prevail, not merely with regard to India, but to Asia generally. There is no lack of interest in these matters. Anything which throws a light on the ancient religion and literature of India, the political condition and the manners of the people in remote times, must have an abiding interest, and the public are fully impressed with the importance of these studies as illustrating the growth of opinion and progress of mankind in the West as well as the East. Papers devoted to Eastern questions constantly find a place in publications of other societies or in works which have a more special bearing on the history of the West. This arises from causes which have long been in operation. Researches, whether in science or literature, are classified, not according to geography, but according to subjects. Special branches are cultivated leading to division of labour and of interest. This may sometimes be carried too far, but we cannot doubt that both literature and science have benefited by it. I met, only a few days since, a curious illustration of this in a Dictionary of Christian Biography recently published. There will be found an elaborate article on the Life and Doctrines of Buddha, and its bearing on the modes of thought which prevailed in the early ages of Christianity, by a distinguished Oriental scholar and a Member of our Society. This is encouraging to those who are working in fields unconnected with matters of popular interest, and with no immediate prospect of reward beyond the interest they derive from their studies, or the good opinion of the few who can appreciate their endeavours; they may be really laying the foundation of knowledge which may benefit mankind and spread through the world. I have said there never was a time when it was of more importance that accurate information should prevail with regard to the East. We are now, perhaps, on the eve of events which will affect materially the political condition of Asia. Admitting fully the great interest which the public take in questions bearing on the\nEast, I have been constantly struck by the imperfect and inaccurate notions which are put forward. Indeed, in carrying out a recent inquiry, the result of which will appear in the next number of our journal, I have been thoroughly impressed with my own imperfections, and the more so when I consider how large are the materials which are available for an accurate history of Asia from the rise of the Muhammadan power, and how important it is that they should be within the reach of Western readers. The Oriental Translation Fund rendered good service in its time, and it is very much to be regretted that its labours have now ceased. Good work has also been rendered by the Government of France. Valuable light has been thrown on the life and career of Muhammad by the works of Sir W. Muir and by Dr. Sprenger. The exertions of the late Sir H. Elliot, to promote the study of Indian history during the Muhammadan period from original sources, has been followed up by a most valuable publication, which has now reached its seventh volume. The importance of studying the vast material which India possesses in this respect was indeed pressed upon the Society a few years ago in a paper by Colonel Nassau Lees. We have further the prospect of a complete edition of one of the most valuable Arabic historical works\u2014the Tabari. This good work may, I hope, be followed up. The public is no longer satisfied with the historical compendiums which suited the wants of former generations. There is a desire to refer to original authorities and to read history in special chapters or in the lives of great men. The aim is to know thoroughly not merely the course of events, but the springs of action which have directed men and nations. Much of this is within our reach, and I hope it may be arrived at by the revival of the work of the Oriental Translation Fund, with such aid as we are entitled to expect from the Government of India. In these remarks I am to be understood as expressing my own opinion only; as they are not matters which have been under the consideration of the Council.\nOn one other matter only I desire to make a remark. Your Council have reported both last year and in the present report, that they have not thought it their duty to take any action in promoting the establishment of the Indian Museum on the Thames Embankment, although, for many years past, they have supported proposals for the erection of a museum on a permanent site. It was hoped that this might be combined with some advantage to this Society. When, however, they were invited to consider the question last year, it was combined with a much larger and more costly proposal, in connexion, not merely with India, but the Colonies, which would have involved an appeal to Parliament for funds, or to private contributions. I wish to do every justice to the indomitable exertions of Dr. Forbes Watson in promoting this scheme, and will not say a word to discourage the exertions of those who desire to promote it; but it seemed to me, as I think it did to the Council, too large a question for us to take up. I should have hesitated to press it in this form on Parliament, and we could not undertake a canvass for subscriptions. At the same time, the Council do not abate in any way in their hope that a building for the Indian Museum may be ultimately erected. I have now, on the part of the Council and myself, to say that we feel very grateful to the Members of the Society for the support accorded by them, and that to merit this we will always do our best.\n\nSir Edward Colebrooke then announced the following Members to serve as the Council and Officers of the ensuing year, 1877-8:\n\nPresident.\u2014Sir T.

Shirt.\n\nThe Society has therefore elected twenty-four new Resident Members, and sixteen Non-Resident Members, or in all forty new members.\n\nOn the personal history of some of these whom we have lost, a few words will now be said.\n\n(1). Henry Thoby Princep.\u2014Among those who were for many years among the warmest supporters of this Society (indeed, who has only retired from it quite recently), there is no one who has been better known than Mr. Henry Thoby\nPrinsep, who died at Freshwater, Isle of Wight, on February 11 last, from an attack of bronchitis, at the advanced age of eighty-five.\n\nMr. Prinsep, the third son of Mr. John Prinsep, some time an Alderman of the City of London, and Member of Parliament in 1802 for Queensborough, was born in 1792 at Thoby Priory, Essex.\n\nIn July, 1807, he entered the College at Haileybury, whence, after keeping only three terms, and obtaining prizes for his proficiency in mathematics, political economy, history and law, and being also at the head of his form, the East India Company allowed him to proceed to India before he had quite completed the usual course. On his arrival at Calcutta, on July 20, 1809, he took up his residence in the College of Fort William, then recently founded, and passed as soon as was possible in Persian, Hindustani, and Bengali, respectively; thereby showing himself thus early a proficient in the studies most likely to be of value to him in his future career. When, subsequently, he entered on his professional duties, as a servant of the East India Company, he at once distinguished himself still further, by obtaining the first degree of honour for his knowledge of Arabic and of Muhammadan law, for the encouragement of which studies, the Government of the day had offered a prize of 5000 rupees. From this period to the spring of 1843, with the exception of a visit to England between May, 1824, and October, 1826,\u2014during which he was mainly instrumental in procuring the boon of the furlough for the Civil Service,\u2014Mr. Prinsep was constantly in India, and, rising gradually in the service, and, in all cases, exhibiting remarkable ability and attention to the duties he had to perform, filled, in succession, almost every post of importance, under the Government or Governors of India. Thus, from the official Registers at the India Office, we learn that, in 1810, he obtained his first appointment as Assistant to the Registrar of the Sudder Dewany and Nizamut Adaulat, and,\nhaving shown in this post remarkable aptitude for business, with great knowledge of details, was selected by the then Governor-General, the Marquess of Hastings, to accompany him in his tour through the N.W. Provinces, on which occasion he succeeded in bringing the Allied Native States to a sense of the duty they owed to the British Government by aiding it in its suppression of the Pindari bands. In a second and similar tour, in 1817, he did even more important work, by settling, with honour to himself and advantage to his country, political differences in Burdwan and the adjacent districts which had long existed.\n\nIn 1820 he became Secretary to Government in the Persian and a little later in the Judicial Department; and, in 1823, carried out successfully the important work of completing the new Code of the Customs Law: about the same time, also, he acted, for a time, as a Member of the Council of the Governor-General, in the place of Mr. Butterworth Bayley. In 1830 he made a tour of the North-Western Provinces with the Governor-General, Lord William Bentinck, and, from this period till 1840, held, in succession, the highest offices to which a civilian can attain, including that of Officiating Secretary to Government in the Secret and Political Departments.\n\nIn February, 1840, he took his seat as a Member of the Supreme Council, retaining this rank till he sailed for England in 1843.\n\nPreviously to leaving India, the Asiatic Society of Bengal had hung his portrait in their Museum; and so greatly was he respected by the native population, that the leading Hindus and Muhammadans presented an address to him, with the request that a bust of him might be executed and placed in the Town Hall of Calcutta.\n\nIn July, 1850, Mr. Prinsep was elected a Director of the East India Company by a majority of 900 votes; and, on the assumption by the Crown of the charge of Indian Affairs, in\n1858, he was one of those chosen, under the Act for the Better Administration of Indian Affairs, to serve on the Council of the Secretary of State for India, an office he held for the following sixteen years, till his final retirement in 1874, after the long service of 64 years.\n\nMr. Prinsep, on his return to England, was very anxious to obtain a seat in Parliament, and, with that object, contested, in the Conservative cause, though unsuccessfully, the boroughs of Kilmarnock, Dartmouth and Dover: he carried his election however, at Harwich, in 1851, and took his seat in the House of Commons; but was subsequently unseated on petition.\n\nIn 1835, he married Sara, one of the daughters of Mr. Pattle, of the Bengal Civil Service, and leaves issue, a daughter married, and three sons, one Acting Judge of the High Court of Calcutta, another, the well-known artist, Mr. Valentine Prinsep, who has been recently in India, collecting materials for his picture of the Imperial Durbar of January 1, 1877.\n\nMr. Prinsep was the type of the old Civil servant of the East India Company. With ability that would have raised him to the foremost rank of any profession, and an energy and perseverance remarkable even in India, he was content to devote his whole strength to the administration of the Government, laying aside all thought of self or personal aggrandizement. It is a proof of his single-mindedness, that, after an unusually long service, during more than half of which he held prominent Civilian appointments\u2014with the full recognition of his worth and talents, he has passed away, without having received any of the honours, so frequently lavished on much less able men.\n\nMr. Prinsep was the author of several useful works, of which may be mentioned, \"The History of the Political and Military Transactions in India during the Administration of the Marquess of Hastings, 1813 to 1823. 2 vols. Lond. 1825.\"\u2014\"Memoirs of a Pathan Soldier of Fortune, the Nawab Muhammed Ameer Khan, Cale., 1832.\"\u2014\"Origin of the\nSikh Power in the Panjab and Political Life of Maharajah Bunjit Singh, 1835.\"\u2014\"Note on the Historical Results deducible from Recent Discoveries in Afghanistan, London, 1844,\"\u2014and \"Tibet, Tartary and Mongolia\u2014their Social and Political Condition, and the Religion of Boodh, as there existing, London, 1861.\" He also published several pamphlets on the local questions of the day, contributing also to the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, the following papers: (1). \"Estimate of the Risk of Life to the Civil Servants of the Bengal Presidency, in each year of their Residence in India, vol. i., 1833.\" (2). \"On the Adaptation of the Roman Alphabet to the Orthography of Oriental Languages, vol. iii., 1834.\"\n\n(9). Mr. Henry Fox Talbot, the eldest son of W. Dawesgust Talbot and Lady Elizabeth Theresa Fox Strangways, the eldest daughter of the Earl of Ilchester, was born February 11, 1800; and was therefore, at his death on September 17, 1877, in his seventy-eighth year.\n\nAt an early age Mr. Talbot was sent to Harrow (whence, in 1812, Dr. Butler, the then Head Master, wrote of him to Lord Winchelsea as a boy of much promise), and soon showed a taste for physical and chemical experiments not common among school-boys. Shortly after leaving Harrow he proceeded to Cambridge, obtained a scholarship at Trinity, and, subsequently, in 1820, the Porson Prize, and, on passing his final examination, he appeared as twelfth Wrangler, securing also, at the same time, the second Chancellor's Medal. From Cambridge he went abroad, and spent a considerable time on the Continent, following out those branches of scientific inquiry to which his mathematical attainments naturally prompted him. The list of papers contributed by him to English and Foreign Journals, recently published in the Royal Society's catalogue, amounting to no less than forty-five, between 1822 and 1861, show how early and how late, as well as how zealously, he pursued his favourite studies. The first paper\nin this list was printed, in 1822, in Gergonne's Ann. Math., and is entitled \"On the Properties of a certain Curve drawn from the Equilateral Hyperbola.\" At the commencement, too, of his scientific career, indeed so early as 1826, we find him paying especial attention to the Phenomena of Light, a study which enabled him in later years to make the brilliant discoveries in Photography with which his name has been so long and so justly connected.\n\nIn January, 1839, Daguerre published an account of his Method, and, on the 31st of the same month, Mr. Talbot gave to the Royal Society an account of his own process in a paper entitled \"Some Account of the Art of Photogenic Drawings, or of the process by which Natural Objects may be made to delineate themselves without the aid of the Artist's Pencil\" (Roy. Soc. Proc. and Phil. Mag. 1839). Early in 1840 a new process, due also to Mr. Talbot's ingenuity, the Calotype (or, as it was often called at the time, the Talbotype), created a sensation in scientific circles. The main feature of this method being the production of a photographic picture on sensitised silver iodide held in suspension, as it were, in the pores of the paper.\n\nIt would be out of place, in a memoir prepared for a literary society, to dwell at greater length on Mr. Talbot's purely scientific attainments: we pass on, therefore, to that phase of his intellectual development, which brought him into close contact with the studies it has been the province of this Society to carry out with remarkable success. Towards the decipherment of the Cuneiform Inscriptions, in which Mr. Talbot has had a considerable share, he brought thirty years of miscellaneous philological study, and a special acquaintance with the Hebrew language and the Hieroglyphics of Egypt. So long ago as 1826, we find the then keeper of the Museum at Turin, M. de St. Quintin, writing of him as, with the exception of Champollion, the best Hieroglyphic scholar whom he had met with. It is not, however, known that Mr.\nTalbot ever himself published anything on Egyptian literature. Thus armed, it was natural that Mr. Talbot should turn his attention to the new literary work then being unfolded in the East, his first paper being one drawn up for the meeting of the British Association at Glasgow in 1855. From this period to within a short time of his death Mr. Talbot showed his attachment to the second main line of his studies (without, however, at all relaxing his grasp on his earlier and more abstruse mathematical researches), as a list of more than fifty-five articles or papers contributed to this Society, to the Royal Society of Literature\u2014to the Journal of Sacred Literature\u2014to the Transactions of the Biblical Archaeological Society\u2014and to \"Records of the Past\"\u2014sufficiently attest. To him, also, is mainly, if not altogether, due, the happy idea of a committee, who should examine and report on translations of the same Inscription, made, respectively, by Sir H. C. Rawlinson, Dr. Hincks, M. Oppert, and himself; the result of which, published in Vol. XVIII. of the Journal of this Society, contributed more than anything else, to allay the doubts which had been circulated with regard to the truth of the translations of the Assyrian Inscriptions, by some, who, like the late Sir G. Cornwall Lewis, ought to have known better.\n\n(3) Mr. James Whatman Bosanquet, the second son of Samuel Bosanquet, of Forest House, Essex, and the descendant of an ancestor who came to England on the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, was born January 26, 1804, and died December 22, 1877. He was educated at Westminster School, and entered the banking house of Bosanquet & Co. in 1822.\n\nMr. Bosanquet was well known for the zeal with which he prosecuted Chronological inquiries; and, though his views have not been, generally, accepted, no one will doubt that he has shown remarkable perseverance as well as ability in these researches.\n\nHis main topic was the connexion of Sacred and Profane-\nChronology; and his leading principle was the taking about 25 years from what may be called the accepted Chronology\u2014a view he mainly based on the discovery, that the Eclipse of Thebes ought to be placed in B.C. 685, instead of, as had been usually supposed, in B.C. 610. To support this conclusion, he eagerly grasped the various historical and chronological records, recently brought to light in Egypt, Assyria, and Persia, such as the historical tables of the Apis-Bulls, in which are inserted the names of the kings; the four several tables of the Eponymous Archons of Assyria, in which are found the first years of the reigns of Tiglath-Pileser, Sargon and Sennacherib; the Behistun Inscription, with its records of Darius the son of Hystaspes; and the Egibi tablets (lately procured by Mr. George Smith), which give the years and the months of the Kings of Babylonia from Nebuchadnezzar II. to Darius.\n\nBy these means, he held that he had firmly established his second chief point, viz. that there was but one Darius (the son of Hystaspes), who, reigning first in Media, was hence called \"the Mede,\" and, subsequently, in his 62nd year, becoming King of Persia also. Mr. Bosanquet, also, availed himself of various other authorities, such as that of Demetrius, the Jewish Historian and Chronologist of the third century B.C.; the recently discovered Armenian copy of Eusebius; and the Jewish tombstones in the Crimea, with dates counting from the first, and not the second, Captivity: and was thus led to analyze and to re-arrange the several histories and chronologies of the Hebrews, Tyrians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Egyptians and Lydians. He was thus led to believe that Ptolemy's Canon and Usher's Chronology were incorrect, and founded rather on conjecture and compromise.\n\nAnother point, on which Mr. Bosanquet laboured assiduously, was an attempt to show that there were two Cyrus\u2014ones, the father and the other the son, of Cambyses;\u2014the latter view being, he considered, completely established by the Egibi Tablets.\nSome of the principal dates he thought he had fully made out were, that of the Earthquake, June 15, B.C. 763, mentioned in Amos i. 1; the same year, in which the Eclipse took place, of which Sir H. C. Rawlinson first discovered the record.\n\nThe next important date he held he had established, was that of the 14th year of Hezekiah, as beginning March, B.C. 690; marked, as this was, by the Eclipse of the Sun of January 11, B.C. 689, at noonday; when the shadow of the dial of Ahaz went back ten degrees (Isaiah xxxviii. 8)\u2014a date apparently confirmed by Demetrius, Josephus, and Taylor's Cylinder. Other dates were those of B.C. 583 for the Fall of Nineveh and the expulsion of the Scythians after their twenty-eight years' rule: of B.C. 582, for the beginning of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, after the death of his father Nabopolassar or Nebuchodonosor: of B.C. 563, for the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar and the beginning of the Captivity.\n\nAmong the principal writings of Mr. Bosanquet may be mentioned: a work on the Currency, 1830;\u2014The Chronology of the Seventy Weeks, 1836;\u2014The Chronology of the Times of Daniel, Ezra, and Nehemiah, 1848;\u2014Messiah the Prince, 1866\u2014with a second and enlarged edition in 1869\u2014in which, he controverted Dr. Pusey's Chronology and explanation of the Seventy Weeks;\u2014and the Appendix to the History of Ashurbanipal by G. Smith, 1871. He, also, wrote a series of papers published in the Chronological Institute between the years 1856\u20141864.\n\nMr. Bosanquet contributed as many as seventeen papers to the Journal of Sacred Literature, and nine to the Journal of the Biblical Archaeological Society, of which, with Mr. Fox Talbot, he was an energetic supporter.\n\nTo the Journal of this Society Mr. Bosanquet contributed four papers:\n\n1. Chronology of the reigns of Tiglath-Pileser, Sargon, Shalmanezer and Sennacherib, in connexion with the pheno-\nmenon seen on the Dial of Ahaz.\u2014J. R. A. S. Vol. XV. p. 277, 1855.\n\n2. Corrections of the Canon of Ptolemy, required in order to place it in harmony with the Solar Eclipses of January 11, B.C. 689, and May 28, B.C. 585.\u2014J. R. A. S. Vol. XV. p. 416.\n\n3. Chronology of the Medes from the reign of Deioces to the reign of Darius, the son of Hystaspes, or Darius the Mede.\u2014J. R. A. S. Vol. XVI. p. 39, 1860.\n\n4. Assyrian and Hebrew Chronology compared, with a view of showing the extent to which the Hebrew Chronology of Ussher must be modified, in conformity with the Assyrian Canon.\u2014J. R. A. S. New Series, Vol. I. p. 7.\n\nIn Mr. Rosanquet, Sacred Archaeology has lost a zealous student and a generous patron. The Society of Biblical Archaeology is especially indebted to him, not only for literary but for pecuniary contributions, and, as is well known, Mr. George Smith's History of Ashurbanipal (an expensive work from the quantity of Cuneiform type required for it, and the handsome manner in which it was got up) was mainly published at the personal cost of Mr. Rosanquet and Mr. Fox Talbot.\n\n(4). Mr. John Clark Marshman, the son of the well-known Baptist Missionary of Serampore, Dr. Marshman, was born in August, 1794, and, from an early period of life, took, like his father, an active part in the promotion of Christianity in the East, and in the religious and educational movements in India. He was, also, the first to found a newspaper in Bengali, the Samachar Darpan, and, also, to establish the first English newspaper, the Friend of India. He was, at the same time, actively engaged on various philological works connected with the native languages of India. Thus, as a Bengali scholar and a student of Indian history, he found time, in the midst of other important duties, to do scholar's work, at a period when such work was peculiarly valuable;\nand, together with Dr. Carey, to publish the first Bengali Dictionary, which has, since, gone through more than one edition, and is still, in many respects, the most important book of its class. Besides this, he contributed, for the general history of India, several books of much use for the purposes for which he intended them. His lives of Carey, Marshman, and Ward, will always have an interest for those who love to recall the past successes of missionary adventure, while the Memoirs of Sir Henry Havelock describe well the career of that distinguished soldier. Mr. Marshman's \"Guide to the Civil Law of the Presidency of Fort William\" (1st edition, Serampore, 1842) was a valuable compendium of Indian Law as it then existed; and his \"Darogah\" Manual (Serampore, 1850) did, on a smaller scale, for the laws relating to the Police, what his previous work had done for the Administration of Justice in the Courts. Mr. Marshman was for ten years official translator to the Government of Bengal, a post for which he was admirably fitted by his legal and linguistic attainments: he was also for many years editor of the \"Calcutta Review,\" and contributed numerous papers to that periodical: while for the Journal of this Society he wrote the following three papers:\n\n1. Notes on the Production of Tea in Assam and in India, generally.\u2014J. R. A. S. Vol. XIX. p. 315, 1862.\n\n2. Notes on the Cultivation of Cotton in the District of Dharwar; past, present and future.\u2014J. R. A. S. Vol. XIX. p. 351, 1862.\n\n3. On the Cost and Construction of Railways in India.\u2014J. R. A. S. Vol. XX. p. 397, 1868.\n\n(5). By the death of Mr. W. S. F. Mayers, at Shanghai, on the 24th of March, Chinese scholarship no less than Chinese diplomacy has incurred a severe loss. Appointed in 1859, as a Student Interpreter in China, Mr. Mayers rose so rapidly in his profession that, within one year of his landing in China, he was appointed Interpreter to the Allied Commission, which was charged with the Government of Canton.\nAt this time, Sir Harry Parkes was engaged in arranging with the Chinese for the acquisition of a new Factory in that city, and the services of Mr. Mayers proved of great value, in the long and arduous negotiations this important undertaking entailed. On the evacuation of that city by the Allies, in 1861, Mr. Mayers was appointed Interpreter to the Consulate at Canton, a post rarely, if ever, given to one who had so recently entered the service. In 1863, he was transferred to Shanghai, but soon afterwards returned to Canton, as Acting Vice-Consul. In 1870, he was again sent northwards, and, after performing the duties of Consul at Chefoo for two years, received the appointment of Secretary of Legation at Peking. The period was one, when the relations between the English and the Imperial Government of China were more than usually strained, and the duties of the Secretary were, thus, of the most arduous kind. Indeed, the negotiations on the \"Audience question\" were sufficiently onerous, without the addition of those entailed by the murder of Mr. Margery. Mr. Mayers was not a mere official: on the contrary, at various periods of his career, he found time to publish most valuable contributions on the Literature of China and the Chinese. The admirable Manual of Chinese Bibliography by the Messrs. von Mollendorff records no less than fifty-nine papers contributed by him to different periodicals at home, and abroad; and, it is likely, that this list, to the middle of 1875, might now be considerably increased. Among these we find one paper contributed to the J.R.A.S. n.s. Vol. IV. entitled \"Illustrations of the Lamaist System in Tibet drawn from Chinese Sources,\" which was subsequently published separately in a short pamphlet of 24 pp. in 1869. Mr. Mayers also published more than one independent work, the result of which will not be ephemeral. Thus his \"Chinese Reader's Manual\" will, for years, hold the first place, as a work of reference for instruction in Chinese, to which may be added, \"The Treaty Ports of China,\" which he edited with Mr. Denny, \"The Anglo-\nChinese Calendar Manual,\" his recent volume \"On the Foreign Treaties with China.\" Another work by him, \"On the Government of China,\" is in the press. At the time of his death, it is known that he had made much progress towards a grammar of the Corean Language, while it must not be forgotten, that to him mainly is due, the recent acquisition by the British Museum of one of the few existing copies of the celebrated \"Imperial Compendium of Chinese Literature,\" in 5020 volumes.\n\n(6). The Revd. G. C. Geldart,\\(^1\\) who died at Croydon on July 15 in his fifty-eighth year, was a philologist of considerable ability, though long-continued ill-health had prevented him from accomplishing the amount of solid work of which he was capable. He was a friend and pupil of the late Professor Goldst\u00fccker and a profound Gaelic and Gothic scholar. In a paper read before the British Association in 1858, entitled, \"Language no test of Race,\" Mr. Geldart advanced a view not then, if now, popularly accepted; and in another paper, presented to the Oriental Congress in 1874, \"On the Assyrian Permansive in Acu,\" he threw considerable light on an obscure branch of Assyrian grammar, which he had approached rather from the side of general philology, than from the Assyrian itself.\n\n(7). By the death of Professor Grassmann, philology and pure science have alike sustained a great loss. For many years Professor of Mathematics in the High School of Stettin, it was comparatively late in life that he took up those studies which have for ever connected him with the great Sanskrit scholars of the Continent. Thus, so early as 1854, long before Helmholtz had published his \"Tonempfindungen,\" so admirably translated by Mr. A. J. Ellis, Prof. Grassmann had propounded his own theory of the true nature of vowels.\n\n\\(^1\\) The obituary sketches of Mr. Geldart, and Drs. Grassmann and Hoffmann are those of gentlemen not members of this Society; they are given here as those of men eminent for their Oriental or linguistic knowledge.\nIt is a remarkable fact, that when he first, at the age of 53, in 1861, appeared as a scholar with an article in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, \"On Consonants followed by J,\" he was practically an unknown man. His first article was soon followed by others, each one containing some new discovery, and proving him to be a perfect master of the subject he had taken up. All through his writings, he shows his early and severe mathematical training, never using one word more than was required to prove his point, and never displaying knowledge for mere sake of display. But by far his most important work was what he did for the Rig-Veda\u2014and his mode of working was unique. So to speak, he took the Rig-Veda to pieces, and, by comparing hundreds and hundreds of passages in which the same word or the same form occurred, was able to prove, with almost mathematical certainty, what such a word must mean, and, also, that it could have no other meaning. He worked his way, much as have done the decipherers of Cuneiform or Hieroglyphic characters, first analytically, and then synthetically. Hence it is, that his translation of the Vedas is a decided step in advance, and shows how much has been done since Langlois made his translations in 1848. Indeed, Dr. Grassmann's translation of the Hymns of the Rig-Veda may be fairly considered the first really critical rendering of them; and his reputation will still endure, indeed, will probably be yet more highly appreciated, as, what his work has really been, becomes more fully and more widely known.\n\n(8). Dr. J. J. Hoffmann, the most distinguished of Japanese scholars, was born at Wurtzburg, in Bavaria, in February, 1805, and died at Leyden on Jan. 19, 1878. In 1830, he chanced to meet Dr. S. v. Siebold, who had recently returned from Japan, and, from him, he learned as much Japanese as the great naturalist was able to teach him; while, from a native Chinaman, who had come to Europe with Siebold, he picked up, also, the elements of the Chinese language. In December, 1846, by the exertions of M. Leemans, the well-\nknown Curator of the Egyptian Museum at Leyden, Dr. Hoffmann was appointed Interpreter for the Japanese and Chinese Languages; and, at once, set himself to compile a Japanese Dictionary and Grammar, his first work being the publication of \"An Attempt at a Japanese Grammar,\" compiled by M. Donker Curtius. Ten years later, he published his own Japanese Grammar, simultaneously in Dutch and English, but, only last year, was able to commence the printing of his great Japanese Dictionary, of which six sheets and a half were completed before his death. One great difficulty Dr. Hoffmann had to contend with was the fact, that he had no fount of type, hence was compelled himself to turn letter-cutter, and to engrave the punches as he required them. Nor was this all; as there were no available compositors, he had to take upon himself this work too, so that the whole of the Chinese and Japanese types in the first edition of his Grammar were composed by himself. Besides all this work, it was his duty, also, to train all the young men, who had to go out to the Dutch Colonies as Interpreters. A short time before his death, he published a little work on Japanese Poetry, entitled \"Japanische Studien, erster nachtrag zur Japanischen Sprachlehre.\" It is satisfactory to know that his death will not prevent the completion of the printing of his Dictionary, as the whole of the MS. has been copied out by him, in preparation for the press.\n\nCouncil.\u2014The Council have to report to the Society that in the autumn of the last year, a sub-committee met, consisting of Sir H. C. Rawlinson, K.C.B., Director, in the Chair, Arthur Grote, Esq., V.P., James Fergusson, Esq., F.R.S., V.P., Edward Thomas, Esq., F.R.S., Treasurer, and R. N. Cust, Esq., Hon. Librarian, to consider the present terms of the arrangement with Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner & Co. for the publication of the Society's Journal. The sense of the majority of the sub-committee being in favour of retaining the existing agreement with Messrs. Tr\u00fcbner, it was recommended that it\nshould be continued, with the following modification, viz., that, in future, the Journal should consist of Three Parts, annually, instead of Two, and that these should be published in January, April, and July, respectively; the third part, to contain the Annual Report and the Index to the Volume.\n\nAt a subsequent meeting of the same sub-committee it was determined:\u20141. That no Paper for the Journal shall, in future, be sent to the Printer, except through the Secretary, and that he be directed previously to ascertain from the Printer the probable expenses of setting up and printing the Paper, before ordering it to be printed. 2. That the Secretary, as Editor of the Journal, shall act as intermediary between the Author and the Printer, in all stages of its progress through the Press. 3. That he be authorized to sanction all ordinary corrections up to 10 per cent. on the printing expenses, any excess beyond these limits to be referred by him to the Council. 4. That no illustrations be ordered, except by the Editor, with the sanction of the Council.\n\nThe Council have further to report that Art. LVIII. of the \"Regulations\" of the Society has been slightly modified by the omission of the words \"twelve months,\" and will, therefore, run, in future, thus: \"Every original communication presented to the Society becomes its property, but the author or contributor may republish it after its publication by the Society.\"\n\nThe Council has sanctioned the incorporation with it of the newly-formed \"Straits Asiatic Society,\" under the title of \"The Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society.\" A memorial has been addressed by the Council to the Commissioners of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge requesting them to take into their favourable consideration, the propriety of founding Professorial chairs for the more recondite Dead languages of the East, the Egyptian and the Cuneiform, and to provide for them the material support of some allowance, whether by the aid of scholarships or in some other way, for one or more students.\nThe following Papers have been read at different Meetings of the Society, since the last anniversary:\n\n1.

Part I. contains papers by E. L. Brandreth, Esq.; by Pramada Dass Mittra; by the late R. Friedrich; by E. T. Rogers, Esq.; by D. C. Boulger, Esq.; and J. H. Batten, Esq.; and Vol. X. Part II. by Major-General S. B. Miles; by A. Gray, Esq.; by Captain C. J. F. S. Forbes; by H. L. St. Barbe, Esq.; by Dr. P. Haupt; by M. H. Sauvaire; and by T. W. Kingsmill, Esq.\n\nIn his paper, \"On the Non-Aryan Languages of India,\" Mr. Brandreth called attention to the fact, that a large quantity of new materials had been collected, since, in August 1853, Prof. Max M\u00fcller wrote his famous letter to the Chevalier Bunsen, \"On the Last Results of Turanian Researches,\" which was subsequently published by Bunsen in vol. i. of his \"Outlines of the Philosophy of Universal History, 1854.\" Mr. Brandreth stated, generally, that the Non-Aryan languages may be considered as comprehended under six principal heads: the Dravidian, Kolarian, Tibeto-Burman, Khasi, Tai, and Mon-Anam\u2014each group being distinguished by well-marked differences in grammar. Mr. Brandreth, at the same time, laid before the Society a language map of British India, now appended to his paper in the Journal.\nMr. Mittra's paper was an ingenious attempt to expound the idea of a Supreme Being as conceived by the Vedanta Philosophy. According to this view, Brahma would seem to be the absolute God, and not conscious of the Universe, because existing before it existed.\u2014Mr. Friederich's paper \"On the Island of Bali\" was a continuation of previous papers by the same writer published in the Journal, and treated of \"The Princely Families,\" \"The Feudal System,\" \"Caste,\" and of \"The Calculation of Time in Bali.\"\u2014Mr. Rogers, in his paper \"On Unpublished Glass Weights and Measures,\" stated that he had already advanced the opinion that the glass disks, bearing Cufic inscriptions, of which a large number are preserved in the British Museum, were really coin-weights. In this paper he was able to show from the inscriptions themselves that this view was no longer hypothetical, but a certainty; as the words Kist, Kharubah, and Kirat (names of known weights) occur on some of the pieces he has described and engraved.\n\nIn his paper \"On China via Tibet,\" Mr. Boulger pointed out the value of one of the stipulations in the Convention signed at Chefoo by Sir Thomas Wade and Li-Hung-Chang, as granting, on the part of the Chinese Emperor, intercourse between India and China through Tibet. It may be doubted, however, whether the nominal assent of the remote government of Peking will overcome the resistance to foreigners, so characteristic of the rule of the Dalai Lama in Tibet; nor is there at present any evidence of the relaxation of the rigid system of protection the rulers of Tibet have hitherto uniformly enforced.\n\nMr. J. H. Batten contributed, in his \"Notes and Recollections on Tea Cultivation in Kumaon and Garhwal,\" a pleasant sketch of the history of the Tea plant in India, in the early nurturing of which he had much experience; adding the remarkable fact that, so long ago as Dec. 1824, Bishop Heber had remarked, in his Tour in Upper India, that \"for the\ncultivation of tea, I should apprehend that both the hilly and the hilly surface of Kumaon, in all of which is contained the Tea provinces of China, are extremely favourable.\n\nThe first real step in the history of Kumaon-Tai was the appointment by the then Governor-General Lord William Bentinck of a \"Committee for the purpose of submitting a plan for the accomplishment of the introduction of Tea Culture into India, and for the superintendence of its execution.\"\n\nIn the first paper of Part II, General Miller discussed carefully the views of the Roman Geographer, especially those of Pliny, who wrote at a period when the coast of Adelia was fairly known to both Greeks and Romans; much more had, however, been learnt by the time of Ptolemy; hence, Dr. Spengler's recent work, in which he has taken Ptolemy for his text, at the same time making use of the early Arab Geographers, has thrown great light on this subject. General Miles, from his personal experience, has been able to propose many further identifications, and to give many valuable suggestions.\u2014Mr. Gray, in his paper, deals first with the question of the Sinhalese language, whether it be of Aryan or Turanian origin, deciding in favour of the former view\u2014and, then, discusses the remarkable story of M. Pyrard, who, after having been wrecked on the Maldives Islands, remained there, for many years, practically, a prisoner; though, as he had made friends with some of the chief men, he was permitted to go about trading from island to island. In 1607, the King of Bengal made a descent on these islands, and Pyrard was carried off to India, whence, in 1611, he was able to return to France. To the curious story of his adventures, he had added a Maldivian vocabulary, which Mr. Gray has carefully studied and annotated.\u2014Captain Forbes, \"On Tibeto-Burman Languages,\" discusses the question of the two great branches of the Myanma or Burmese race, the Burmans proper and the Arakanese, with the further question whether these should be so absolutely divided. The Burmese, he states, admit that the\noldest and purest form of their language has been preserved in Arrakan\u2014and adds, from his own knowledge, that the structure of the two dialects is precisely the same, their divergence not being greater than between the English of Somersetshire and of Middlesex. Indeed, this much might have been naturally expected from the political history of the two countries, especially as the Burmans represent themselves as the last comers, a view accepted by Sir Arthur Phayre and other authorities.\u2014Mr. St. Barbe, in his paper \"On Burmese Transliteration,\" points out the curious fact that there is probably no language in the world where the letters offer so little clue to the pronunciation, or where there are so many modifications of the vocal sounds. Mr. St. Barbe had, however, tried what could be done by giving two versions of every word, the one as it is written, the other as it is pronounced; representing its individual characters by the English symbols now employed in all transliterations of Indian words; a plan not greatly differing from that adopted and uniformly practised by Sir Arthur Phayre.\u2014Capt. Forbes, in a second paper \"On the Connexion of the Mons of Pegu with the Koles of Central India,\" showed that the Mons have been but too little studied, though there can be little doubt that they are, really, the oldest population now existing in that peninsula, and further that they do not belong to the Tibeto-Burman family. The two scholars who have chiefly investigated their History are Dr. Mason and Sir Arthur Phayre.\u2014Dr. Haupt, in a remarkable paper \"On the Comparative Grammar of the Semitic Languages,\" points out that Assyrian is in truth the Sanskrit of the Semitic family of speech (as, indeed, Dr. Hincks and Mr. Sayce have already clearly recognized), and that this fact goes far to prove that Assyrian is really the oldest Semitic language of which we know anything.\u2014M. Sauvaire, \"On Arab Metrology,\" translates a MS. in the National Library at Paris, containing a \"Treatise on the Balance,\" which gives the various values of the measures of\nweight used in Muslim countries and the method used for converting weights, expressed in the terms of one place, into those of another.\u2014Mr. T. W. Kingsmill, the President of the North China Asiatic Society, \"On the Migrations of the White Huns,\" traced the curious history of the wanderings of the Yueti (the Ephthalites of the Greek and the Haiathalaha of the Arab writers), who, in the second century B.C., overran and destroyed the Greco-Indian kingdom of Bactria; at the same time suggesting, on philological grounds, the word Vidal or Viddhal, as the old Chinese name, Graecized by Procopius into Ephthalita.\n\nAsiatic Societies.\u2014Asiatic Society of Bengal.\u2014The Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal contains many interesting articles, of which we may specify (in vol. xiv. pt. 3) Mr. V. A. Smith's \"Popular Songs of the Hamirpur District in Bundelkhand,\" in a local form of Hindi of which little has, at present, been published. They are chiefly Caste songs, and are, usually, only sung at meetings of the same caste.\u2014A paper by Mr. Carnegie, of much research, on the \"Bhars of Audh and Banaras,\" in which he considers that Sanskrit-speaking races were dominant in Ayodhya and Audh from the days of Rama and the Ramayana down till after the commencement of our era; and, further, that long before the Muhammadan conquest, the distinctions of caste had altogether disappeared, the soil of N.E. Audh and Banaras being occupied by a single God-neglecting race, whom the natives of the present day, for the most part their descendants, speak of with the utmost disdain. This race, he thinks, were the Bhars.\u2014There are, also, good papers, by Mr. F. S. Growse, \"On Sri Swami Hari Das of Brindaban,\" with an excellent drawing of a temple recently erected there, and dedicated to Krishna under his title of Bihari Ji;\u2014by Pramnath Pandit, M.A., \"On the Morals of Kalidasa\";\u2014and by Rajendralala Mitra, \"On the Rajasuya\u2014an Imperial assemblage at Delhi three thousand years ago.\"\nIn vol. xlvii. pt. 1, are papers by Chandra Sekhara Banurji; by G. H. Damant, Esq.; by G. A. Grierson, Esq.; by Lieutenant-Colonel (now Major-General) S. B. Miles; and by C. J. Lyall, Esq. Chandra Sekhara Banurji, \"On the Kaimur Range,\" has given a pleasant and well-written account of a mountain range little visited (though, owing to the Great Indian Railway, accessible enough), on the Eastern spurs of the Vindhya chain, and now occupied by a population who are remarkably peaceable in their dispositions.\u2014Mr. G. Damant's note, \"On the old Manipuri Character,\" is of value as showing how recently letters have been introduced into that district. The alphabet, which is very ill adapted for the language, Mr. Damant considers to be a form of Devanagari, probably brought into the country by some wandering Sanyasi about 1700 A.D. The literature of Manipur is very restricted\u2014indeed, Mr. Damant is unable to enumerate more than five MSS., and scarcely any of the people can read the older writings, and the original characters are now nearly superseded by Bengali. The Manipuris themselves are, probably, a conglomeration of several, originally distinct, tribes.\u2014Mr. Grierson's paper, \"Are Kalidasa's heroes Monogamists?\" is a reply to one by Pramnath Pandit. General Miller's \"Route between Sohar and El Bereyni\" is a clear narrative of a week's journeying through a portion of Arabia little known and rarely traversed, and is, therefore, a valuable addition to our geographical knowledge.\u2014In pt. 2 are valuable papers by R. B. Shaw \"On the Signi (Ghalchah) Dialect\"; by G. S. Leonard \"On the Mythic History of the God Viraj\"; and, \"On further Proofs of the Polygamy of Kalidasa's Heroes\"; by P. Whalley on \"Metrical Translations from the Quatrains of Omar Khayyam\"; and, by Gour Das Bysack \"On Khanja Khan Garh, in the District of Burdwan, Bengal.\" In pt. 3 are papers by W. King, \"On a Prehistoric Monument with Cruciform Monoliths near Mung-pat, in the Nizam's dominions\"; by G. A. Grierson \"On the Rangpur Dialect\";\nby Vincent A. Smith, Esq., \"On the Bhars and Early Inhabitants of Bundelkhund\"; by H. Blochmann \"On an unpublished Ghazal of Hafiz\"; and by R. B. Shaw \"On a Grammar of the Language of Eastern Turkestan.\"\u2014Mr. Grierson's \"Notes on the Rangpur Dialect\" is a valuable contribution to a portion of Indian philology which requires far more study than it has hitherto received\u2014the dialect of Rangpur\u2014itself essentially a border-country\u2014being naturally very much mixed. The alphabet is, nominally, Bengali, but it contains some sounds, apparently not usual in that language; the main scheme of the Rangpuri conjugation, however, is founded on the classical Bengali. Mr. Grierson then gives some curious specimens of Rangpuri folk-songs, using, for them, the Devanagari alphabet as intelligible to a larger number of readers.\u2014Mr. Vincent Smith's paper \"On the Bhars of Bundelkhund\" will be of much interest to students of Ethnology; the present Bhars, as shown by the census of 1872, being almost exclusively confined to the district east of Banaras. Mr. Smith considers them a Non-Aryan race, and congeners with the Gonds, Kols, and Bhils. The people of this district are mentioned in the Travels of Hiouen Thsang in the sixth century A.D.\u2014In the \"Proceedings\" of the Society for January, 1877, is a reprint from the Annual Report of the Philological Society of Mr. R. N. Cust's paper \"On the Non-Aryan Languages of India.\"\n\nBombay Asiatic Society.\u2014Papers have been printed in the Journal of this Society, vol. xii. No. 34, by Mr. E. Rehatsek, \"On the Contact of the Jews with the Assyrians, Babylonians and Persians from the division of the Hebrew Monarchy into two Kingdoms, b.c. 975, till the Entrance of Alexander the Great into Jerusalem, b.c. 333, and a View of Jewish Civilization\": and \"On the B\u00e1w and G\u00e1ob\u00e1rah Sephabuds along the Southern Caspian Shores.\" In his first paper, Mr. Rehatsek traced the connexion of the Jews with\nthe nations adjoining them, especially with the Assyrians, and, at the same time, compared the religious systems of the Assyrians, Medes and Persians; the Jewish faith, though by degrees it became Monotheistic, he held to have been, for a long period, largely mixed with Polytheism. Its purification from this system did not commence till after the Babylonish Captivity. In his second paper, Mr. Rehatschek sketches the history of several small princes or kings, who managed to subsist, for centuries after the complete establishment of Islam, partly as independent rulers, partly as rebels against the power of the Khalifs, in the mountain districts south of the Caspian, in Gilan, Mazanderan and Tabaristan. This number of the Journal is, especially, valuable for the many able papers it contains by Messrs. Telang, Bhagvandal Indraji and J. F. Fleet on Copper-Plate Inscriptions, etc., recently recovered, which will be noticed in their proper place. The Society has published an Extra Number giving a \"Detailed Report of Dr. B\u00fchler's Tour in search of Sanskrit MSS. in Kashmir, etc., with lists of those he met with.\n\nNorth China Branch of the Asiatic Society.\u2014In the Journal of this Society, No. X. New Series, are several excellent papers. Thus the Archimandrite Palladius gives one on \"Elucidations of Marco Polo's Travels drawn from Chinese Sources,\" especially with reference to Marco Polo's statement regarding his route from Lobnor to Shangtu in the northern part of China. Mr. T. W. Kingsmill contributes \"Short Notes for the Identification of the Yu\u00e8ti and Kiang Tribes of Ancient Chinese History,\" and Dr. Bretschneider a very valuable paper entitled \"Notices of the Medieval Geography of Central and Western Asia,\" in which the writer has carefully examined the Chinese and Mongol writings, and compared them with the observations of Western authors in the Middle Ages. In the Appendices are, a list of the Principal Tea-Districts in China, and a long Report from the \"Observatoire\nM\u00e9t\u00e9orologique et Magnetique des P\u00e8res de la Compagnie de J\u00e9sus \u00e0 Zi-ka-wei,\u201d extending from Sept. 1874, to Dec. 1875. New Series, No. XI. contains the Address of the President, T. W. Kingsmill, Esq., \u201cOn the Border Lands of Geology and History,\u201d and papers by H. E. Hobson \u201cOn Fort Zeelandia and the Dutch occupation of Formosa\u201d;\u2014by O. v. M\u00f6llendorff, \u201cOn the Vertebrata of the Province of Chihli, with Notes on Chinese Zoological Nomenclature\u201d;\u2014by the Rev. W. A. P. Martin \u201cOn the Style of Epistolary Composition\u201d;\u2014by Dr. Edkins, \u201cOn Chinese Names for Boats and Boat-gear, with Remarks on the Chinese Use of the Mariner\u2019s Compass\u201d;\u2014and by Mr. O. C. Stent, \u201cOn Chinese Eunuchs.\u201d That by Dr. Edkins is very interesting, as he seems inclined to believe that the Chinese were acquainted with the use of the loadstone, at a period considerably earlier than Klapproth admitted in his letter to Humboldt.\n\nChina Review.\u2014In the China Review of this year are many valuable articles, among which may be noticed, those by the Rev. Mr. Chalmers, \u201cOn Chinese Natural Theology,\u201d \u201cOn a Chinese MS. of the New Testament,\u201d \u201cOn the Rhymes of the Shi-king,\u201d and \u201cOn Chinese Etymology.\u201d In the first of these Mr. Chalmers traces out the Chinese ideas on Theology, and accepts, generally, the matured views of Prof. Legge. In the second, he states the origin of this MS., which proves to be a copy of one in the British Museum, written by Mr. Morrison and a native Chinese named Yong Sam-tak in the years 1804\u20136. The version is from the Vulgate, and is, therefore, only a literary curiosity. Mr. Chalmers\u2019s third paper \u201cThe Book of Poetry of the Shi-king,\u201d will be of value to the philologist as enabling him to ascertain with accuracy the earliest sounds of Chinese words, and to the historian, as affording a clue to the antiquity of many Chinese works. In his fourth paper Mr. Chalmers points out the value of the Shohuc\u00e2n composed by Hu-Sh\u00e2n A.D. 100, and\nreviews, Dr. Edkins's Introduction to the Study of the Chinese Characters.\n\nN. N. contributes three papers \"On Chinese Grammar,\" with especial reference to the documentary style,\u2014that is, the modern prose of China, as, for instance, that of the Peking Gazette, the only really indigenous periodical published in the Empire. These will be found very useful to students commencing Chinese, from the clearness of the views expressed in them.\n\nDr. Edkins prints a learned paper \"On the Twenty-eight Constellations\"; and Mr. Kingsmill one entitled, \"Ethnological Sketches from the Dawn of History,\" in which he shows that the Tsins or Seres are first recognizable in history, as extending along the river King on the frontier of the present provinces of Shensi and Kansuh. Other papers of interest, are\u2014by O. F. v. Mollendorff, \"Addenda et Corrigenda to Dr. Bretschneider's pamphlet inscribed Archaeological and Historical Researches on Peking and its Environs\";\u2014by Dr. Eitel, \"On Chinese Studies and Official Interpretation in the Colony of Hong Kong\";\u2014by C. F. Preston, \"On the Constitutional Law of the Chinese Empire\";\u2014by C. Alabaster, \"Law of Inheritance (continued)\";\u2014by A. A. Faivel, \"On the Wild Silkworms of the Province of Shantung\";\u2014by W. F. Mayers, \"Bibliography of the Chinese Imperial Collections of Literature, with special reference to the great Compendium of Chinese Literature, lately acquired for the British Museum\";\u2014by Dr. Legge, \"Four Lectures on Imperial Confucianism, delivered at Oxford in the Trinity and Michaelmas Terms of 1877\";\u2014by G. M. H. Playfair, \"On Chinese Official Titles\";\u2014and by H. Kopseh, \"Geographical Notes on the Province of Kiang-si.\"\n\nMr. Beal, the Professor of Chinese in University College, London, has given two lectures during April, 1878, \"On the Chinese Version of the Buddhist Tripitaka.\" In the first of these, he named, in succession, the translators who had\ntravelled from India to China, and the works they had rendered into the Chinese language during the first and second centuries A.D., showing, from the number (more than 400) of these books, how zealous and earnest these missionaries must have been, at the same time drawing some important conclusions from the character of the books themselves, as to the development, at that date, in India itself, from the Primitive to the Scholastic period of Buddhist History. In his second lecture Mr. Beal began to analyze the version of the \"Lotus of the Good Law,\" as known in China, and to compare it with the Sanskrit copy from which M. Burnouf prepared his translation; and pointed out the light the Chinese copy throws on many obscure phrases of the original. He commented, also, on the meaning of the title of the book itself, and showed this to be a metaphorical one, used to signify the infinite and unmeasurable field of Creation or Cosmical Phenomena as conceived by the later schools of Buddhist literature.\n\nThe British Museum has secured a work, unique in the literature of the world, the Kin Ting koo kin too shoo teek ching, or Complete Imperial Compendium of Ancient and Modern Literature, in 5020 volumes. This wonderful collection was compiled by order of the Emperor Kanghe, who reigned from 1662 to 1722, and was printed from moveable types, cast under the direction of the Jesuit missionaries. A commission was occupied for forty years in collecting the materials for it, and the printing was not finished till 1726. This copy belonged to a descendant of one of the men of rank, who had originally received it as a gift from the reigning Emperor Yung-ching, the son of the Emperor who devised, and, in his lifetime, nearly saw the completion of, this vast work of printing.\n\nAsiatic Society of Japan.\u2014The Transactions of this Society (vol. v. parts 1 and 2), contains papers by T. R. McClatchie \"On Japanese Heraldry\";\u2014by B. H. Chamberlain \"On the Use\nof Pillow words and Plays upon Words in Japanese Poetry\";\u2014by Russell Robertson, Esq., \"On the Caroline Islands,\" a group in the North Pacific rarely visited;\u2014by K. Mitsukuri \"On the Early Study of Dutch in Japan.\" The second part of vol. v. is entirely occupied with \"A Summary of the Japanese Penal Codes,\" by Joseph H. Longford, Esq.\n\nJournal Asiatique.\u2014Tome ix. part 1, is wholly occupied by a paper by M. Barbier de Meynard (since published separately) called \"Traduction Nouvelle du Trait\u00e9 de Ghazzali\u2014intitul\u00e9e Le Preservatif de l'Erreur,\" a much more complete work than the edition of Schmudlers in 1842. In part 2, are, a continuation of M. de Harlez's papers \"Etudes Avestiques: 2, Des Controverses relatives au Zend-Avesta\";\u2014by M. Belin, \"Bibliographie Ottomane,\" a list of Turkish works printed at Constantinople A.H. 1290-3, A.D. 1876-7, with other papers by MM. Berger, Feer and Lenormant. In part 3, M. de Harlez continues his researches on the Zend-Avesta, No. 3, and there are, also, papers by M. Stanislas Guyard, \"Un grand Ma\u00eetre des Assassins au temps de Saladin,\" in which he has thrown new light on an important period of Syrian history. He gives, also, the text and translation of Abu Firas, a MS. presented to the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale by M. Catafago: M. Clermont-Ganneau also contributes \"Notes sur la Palestine.\" Tome x. part 1, is wholly occupied by the Annual Report of the Society, which has been drawn up with its usual fullness of reference and ability by M. Renan. In part 2 are papers\u2014by M. Stanislas Guyard, \"Note sur la Metricque Arabe,\" with additional confirmation of the views held by him, derived from other Arabic scholars;\u2014by M. Clermont-Ganneau, \"Sur le Dieu Satrape et les Ph\u00e9niciens dans le P\u00e9loponn\u00e8se\"\u2014a paper (since published separately) full of research and of archaeological as well as Oriental interest;\u2014and by MM. Maspero and Revillout on Egyptian subjects. In part 3, is a paper by M. Zotenberg, entitled \"Memoire\nsur la Chronique Byzantine de Jean, Ev\u00eaque de Nikion,\" with essays on various Inscriptions by MM. Halevy and Ganneau, which will be found under \"Epigraphy.\"\n\nGerman Oriental Society.\u2014The Journal of this Society, vol. xxxi. part 1, is as usual full of valuable contributions for the languages and literature of the East. Of these, may be specified, papers by Dr. A. v. Gutschmid \"Agathangelos,\" a curious inquiry, carefully worked out;\u2014by W. Deecke, \"On the Descent of the Ancient Semitic Alphabet from the later Assyrian Cuneiform,\" a theory which will scarcely be accepted by palaeographers;\u2014and by Dr. Jolly, \"On the Smriti Texts in Dr. Haug's Collection of MSS.\"\n\nParts 2 and 3 contain papers by Dr. Gr\u00fcnbaum, \"On the Comparative Mythology of the Hagada\";\u2014by Dr. R. Schr\u00f6ter, \"Letters from Jacob of Sarug to the Himyarite Christians\";\u2014and by Dr. Blan, \"On Karta and Kerita, occurring in Names of Places.\"\n\nIn Part 4 are papers by W. Deecke, \"On the Connexion between the Indian and the South Semitic Alphabets\";\u2014by E. Haas, \"On Hippocrates and Indian Medi\u00e6val Medicine,\" a continuation of the paper noticed in our last Report \"On the Susruta\";\u2014by E. Meyer, \"On certain Semitic Gods,\" showing the connexion between the Canaanite Anat and the Assyrian Anatu, Anaitis, and Tanit;\u2014and by Dr. Aufrecht, \"A List of Rajmahal Words\" preserved at Cambridge among the papers of Mr. John Bentley.\n\nArch\u00e6ology.\u2014Within the last few days a very interesting report has been received from General Cunningham dated Camp Goonser on the Ganges, February 2, 1878\u2014giving a sketch of the proceedings of the Arch\u00e6ological Survey under his command since the publication of his fifth volume containing his Report on the Punjab for 1872\u20133, and comprehending under separate heads the work done by himself.\nGeneral Cunningham, further, states, that, in addition to these general accounts of his annual Archaeological tours, he proposes to publish separately from time to time such subjects as can be only partially treated on, in the yearly reports: and that much progress has been made by him under the following six headings: 1. Indian Inscriptions. 2. Ancient Indian Architecture. 3. Early Indian Sculpture. 4. Medi\u00e6val\nsur la Chronique Byzantine de Jean, Ev\u00eaque de Nikion,\" with essays on various Inscriptions by MM. Halevy and Gannean, which will be found under \"Epigraphy.\"\n\nGerman Oriental Society.\u2014The Journal of this Society, vol. xxxi. part 1, is as usual full of valuable contributions for the languages and literature of the East. Of these, may be specified, papers by Dr. A. v. Gutschmid \"Agathangelos,\" a curious inquiry, carefully worked out;\u2014by W. Deecke, \"On the Descent of the Ancient Semitic Alphabet from the later Assyrian Cuneiform,\" a theory which will scarcely be accepted by pal\u00e6ographers;\u2014and by Dr. Jolly, \"On the Smriti Texts in Dr. Haug's Collection of MSS.\"\n\nParts 2 and 3 contain papers by Dr. Gr\u00fcnbaum, \"On the Comparative Mythology of the Hagada\";\u2014by Dr. R. Schr\u00f6ter, \"Letters from Jacob of Sarug to the Himyarite Christians\";\u2014and by Dr. Blau, \"On Karta and Keru, occurring in Names of Places.\"\n\nIn Part 4 are papers by W. Deecke, \"On the Connexion between the Indian and the South Semitic Alphabets\";\u2014by E. Haas, \"On Hippocrates and Indian Medi\u00e6val Medicine,\" a continuation of the paper noticed in our last Report \"On the Susruta\";\u2014by E. Meyer, \"On certain Semitic Gods,\" showing the connexion between the Canaanite Anat and the Assyrian Anatu, Anaitis, and Tanit;\u2014and by Dr. Aufrecht, \"A List of Rajmahal Words\" preserved at Cambridge among the papers of Mr. John Bentley.\n\nArch\u00e6ology.\u2014Within the last few days a very interesting report has been received from General Cunningham dated Camp Gooneer on the Ganges, February 2, 1878\u2014giving a sketch of the proceedings of the Arch\u00e6ological Survey under his command since the publication of his fifth volume containing his Report on the Punjab for 1872\u20133, and comprehending under separate heads the work done by himself,\nMr. Beglar, and Mr. Carlisle from that period to the end of 1877. A brief outline only of it can be given here.\n\nWith reference to his publications, General Cunningham states that vol. vi. is now ready\u2014containing 24 plates and Mr. Carlisle's Report on Rajputana for the seasons 1871-2, and 1872-3;\u2014that vol. vii. has been already submitted to Government, with Mr. Beglar's Report on Bundelkhand for 1871-2, and on the Central Provinces for 1873-4;\u2014that vol. viii. has, also, been submitted to Government, with Mr. Beglar's Report on the Bengal Provinces for 1872-3;\u2014that of vol. ix. the text is ready, and the plates nearly so, with Mr. Carlisle's Report on the Doab, Rohilcund and Bhiula Tal (the ancient Kapilavastu), for 1873-4 and 1874-5;\u2014that vol. x. is in preparation and the plates mostly ready, with General Cunningham's Report on the Central Provinces and Malwa for 1873-4, 1874-5, and 1876-7;\u2014that of vol. xi. a portion has been written, with Mr. Beglar's Report on the S. E. Provinces for 1874-5 and 1875-6;\u2014and so, also, with vol. xii., containing Mr. Carlisle's Report on Kasin (the ancient Kasinagara) for 1875-6;\u2014vol. xiii. is also in a state of preparation, with General Cunningham's Reports on the Doab and Oudh for 1875-6 and 1876-7; and also vol. xiv., with Mr. Beglar's Report on Bundelkhand, Malwa and Rajputana for 1876-7. We may add, that, from a letter addressed by the Governor-General in Council to the Secretary of State for India, dated Fort William, March 1, 1878, it may be gathered that all these volumes will be ready for publication by the end of the present year.\n\nGeneral Cunningham, further, states, that, in addition to these general accounts of his annual Archaeological tours, he proposes to publish separately from time to time such subjects as can be only partially treated on, in the yearly reports: and that much progress has been made by him under the following six headings: 1. Indian Inscriptions. 2. Ancient Indian Architecture. 3. Early Indian Sculpture. 4. Medieval\nIndian Architectural Ornament. 5. Medieval Indian Architecture. 6. Muhammadan Architecture.\n\nThe first volume of the \"Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum\" with the \"Inscriptions of Asoka\" has just arrived from Calcutta. It contains thirty plates in 4to. and 141 pages of text. General Cunningham adds that two more are to follow, the second to comprehend the Inscriptions of the Indo-Scythians, of which all the plates are ready; and the third to contain the Gupta Inscriptions, of which about 20 plates have been already reduced. For the second and third subjects a large mass of materials have been accumulated, as is, also, the case with the fifth and sixth\u2014while the fourth has been so far advanced, that a volume of Indian Mosaics illustrated by coloured plates has already been submitted to Government. A second volume, with about 20 to 25 plates of Indian trellis work from the simple chequers of the old temples to the elaborate and delicate tracery of the marble screen of the Tajmahal, is, also, nearly ready.\n\nIn conclusion, General Cunningham mentions that, at the present time, about two-thirds of the whole extent of Northern India from the Indus to the mouth of the Ganges have been surveyed; while many of the places already visited will, in all probability, yield fresh discoveries when excavated. \"I am myself,\" he states, \"now engaged in exploring Southern Oudh; while my assistant Mr. Carlyle is at Lauriya, to the north of Beltiah, excavating the great mounds near Asoka's pillar, and my assistant Mr. Beglar is exploring Eastern Magadha, whence he will proceed, through Southern Tirhut, into Kach Bihar.\"\n\nGeneral Cunningham further hopes that the details of the great Stupa of Bharhat, originally discovered by him in the end of November, 1873, and, since, fully excavated by Mr. Beglar, the discoverer of the valuable Prasenajit Pillar, etc., will soon be published, as the plates are now ready. We are glad to be able to add that the whole of the valuable\nsculptures from Bharhut, having been presented to Government by the R\u00e1ja of Nagod, in whose territory it stands, are now safe in Calcutta. The Inscriptions on the Railing of the Bharhut Stupa are of the same character as those of the great Sanchi Stupa near Bhilsa, but of higher interest; for, besides the names and occupations of donors, etc., common to both places, there are, at Bharhut, many inscriptions serving as labels or titles of the actual sculptured scenes over which they are placed, as \"Bhagavato S\u00e1ka Munino Bodhi, the Bodhi Tree of Buddha Sakya Muni.\" The special value of these short labels is that they enable us to identify the various scenes over which they are placed.\n\nWe may, further, record the publication of the \"Archaeological Survey of Western India, No. 6,\" which has been chiefly executed by Mr. Sinclair under the superintendence of Mr. Burgess. In this paper, are \"Notes\" of some of the Antiquities of the \"Talukas of P\u00e1rner, Sungamner, Ankole and Kopargaum,\" with revised lists of remains in the Ahmadnagar, Nasik, Puna, Thana, and Kaladgi Zillas. Mr. Sinclair gives an interesting account of the \"Brahmanical and Jaina Cave Temples\" at Harichandragarh Hill Fort, Wadhgaum Dary\u00e1, and Dhok\u00e9swara. Of these, the first would seem to be the most important. Mr. Sinclair considers it dates from the end of the eighth century A.D. The funereal monuments show a nearly unbroken succession from an unknown but early period to the present day. Occasionally, monolithic square pillars are met with. There are, also, some monuments resembling Kist-vaens. Mr. Sinclair, also, gives a brief description of a number of small temples at P\u00e1rner, Kasb\u00e1, Ankole, Kopargaum, Kumbhari, and other places; and Mr. W. H. Probert furnishes an account of the various antiquities and architectural remains in eleven Talukas in the Province of Khandesh, many of which it would seem, from his description, are well worthy of further study.\n\nThe third volume of Mr. Burgess's Report of the Survey of\nWestern India is, also, in type, and would have been published before this, but for some delay in revising the texts of the Inscriptions and of their translations, which has been undertaken by Dr. B\u00fchler. It will contain accounts of the Caves of Dhara-sinha, Karosa, and other places in the Nizam's Territory, hitherto almost entirely unknown to Archaeologists, with a full description of those at Aurangabad, which, though better known, have never yet been completely described.\n\nMr. Burgess did not return to India last season, being engaged on a general work on the \"Rock-cut Temples of Western India,\" which, as mentioned in the Report for 1877, p. xxxi, he undertook, in conjunction with Mr. Fergusson. This work is well advanced, and will, it is expected, be published before our next \"Anniversary Meeting.\"\u2014Further researches, in Ceylon, have been delayed by the untimely death of Dr. Goldschmidt, but will, we hope, be, again, soon revived, as, by the last mail, we learn, that his successor, Dr. M\u00fcller, had reached Aden on his way to Colombo.\n\nIn the Journal of the Bengal Asiatic Society Mr. King describes some remarkable Megalithic Monuments, lying a few miles from the Godaverry, on the road to Hemamconda, one peculiarity of which is the presence of some stone crosses, apparently unique among the burial-places of the South of India. The tombs are all built of worked stones, and furnished with coffin-like cavities, in the place of the more usual urns or earthenware chatties; they consist, generally, of four upright toolled slabs placed rectangularly, covered by another flat slab, the whole being generally encircled by a ring of rudely dressed oblong stones, meeting together at their ends. They are probably monuments of some Kolarian family.\n\nIndian Antiquary.\u2014In the Indian Antiquary are many papers bearing on recent researches into the Antiquities, Architectural or Linguistic, of Ancient or Medi\u00e6val India, to the former of which we may briefly call attention here.\nThus Sir Walter Elliot supplies a notice of a remarkable hypethral Temple, in the Hill Tracts of Orissa, from notes supplied to him some years since by Colonel (now Sir John) Campbell, K.C.S.I., which would seem to be well worthy further investigation.\n\nMr. Walhouse contributes three papers: the first, \"On a Gold Treasure-Trove in Madras;\" the second, \"On Chivalry in Lower India;\" the third, \"On Some Hindu Snake Notions.\"\n\nIn his first paper, he gives an account of a very remarkable \"find\" of gold coins, on the site of the once famous port of Kail in Tinnevelly. Unfortunately nearly the whole were melted down, and, of the thirty that were preserved, all were Muhammadan, with the exception of one of Johanna of Naples A.D. 1343-83. It may be inferred that this hoard was collected not long after this last date, and that it was part of the produce of the long-continued traffic between Venice and the East, for, \"at this city,\" says Marco Polo, \"touch all ships that come from the West, from Hormos, Aden, and Arabia.\" The discovery of Roman Gold Coins on the Southern Coast of Hindostan is by no means uncommon.\n\nIn his paper \"On some Hindu Snake Notions,\" Mr. Walhouse gives some details relative to Hindu ideas on this subject\u2014noticing, also, some of their sepulchral customs, existing or prehistoric.\u2014Mr. A. C. Burnell contributes a paper on the inquiry, \"Where was the Southern Charitrapsura mentioned by Hiwen Tsang?\" and arrives at the conclusion that this place must be identified with Kaveripattanam, a once celebrated harbour at the mouth of the Kaveri noticed in the second century A.D. by Ptolemy as Chabereis emporium.\u2014Bishop Caldwell speaks of the discovery of some \"Sepulchral Urns in Southern India,\" many of which, especially those found at Korkei, are of a very unusual size. It is hard to understand how the bodies were forced into them, as \"the mouth is generally so narrow that it would admit only the skull.\" Who the people were so buried has not been ascertained, but that\nthey were, comparatively speaking, a civilized people, is clear from the excellence of their pottery, and, also, from the occasional occurrence, in these jars, of implements of iron. Bishop Caldwell states that they are found on both sides of the Southern Gh\u00e2ts, and a subsequent writer, H.R.H. Rama Varma of Travancore, adds that great quantities of vases similarly employed are found in the neighbourhood of Coimbatore. These are, however, generally inclosed within a massive stone chest; and spear and arrow-heads are often found in them.\n\nThe Rev. Thomas Ffoulkes and Major J. W. Watson contribute papers \"On Fah Hian's Kingdom of the Dakshina,\" and \"On Amandapura in Saurashtra,\" respectively; and Col. Yule examines the origin of the title \"Champa,\" which has been long applied to a portion of the region we call Cochim China. Colonel Yule thinks there is good reason to believe that both the Zaba of Ptolemy, and the Canf or Tsanf of the early Arab mariners, represent the same district.\u2014Mr. Burnell has published in the \"Academy\" a memoir on the Great Temple of Siva at Tanjore, which he considers the oldest structure of the kind in the South of India, with the exception of some caves and monoliths at the \"Seven Pagodas.\" It has, however, several modern additions. Most of the Inscriptions on it belong to the last half of the eleventh century A.D. and record gifts and endowments of the most miscellaneous kind\u2014land, produce, gold in large quantities, silver (hardly mentioned), and copper, chiefly in the form of utensils. Many historical facts are recorded; also, as the conquest of Bengal by a Kola (or Tanjore) king in the eleventh century A.D., as, also, that of Ceylon. Much geographical information may be obtained from these inscriptions; and a flood of light is thrown by them on the social state of the people of this part of India, and, especially, on the history of the village communities and of their constitution. Mr. Burnell adds, \"I have taught a Tamil man, who is a good scholar so far as his own language is concerned, to read the\ncharacters of these Inscriptions, and he has already transcribed most in modern Tamil letters. I shall get them printed when done, and, though a critical edition will still be necessary, this transcript may help students meanwhile.\"\n\nIn the \"Journal of the Bengal Asiatic Society,\" vol. xlvii, part 1, is a paper by H. Rivett Carnac, C.S., entitled \"Rough Notes on some Ancient Sculpturings on Rocks in Kum\u00e1n, similar to those found on Monoliths and Rocks in Europe,\" with six plates. In this paper Mr. Carnac points out the resemblance between these old Indian markings, and those published in 1867 by Sir James Simpson in his \"Archaic Sculpturings.\" They are chiefly found on a rock called Chandeshwar. Mr. Carnac noticed in a temple dedicated to Mahadeo close by, that many of its shrines have also a resemblance to these rock markings. They consist for the most part of a rough pedestal formed of loose stones and surmounted by a Mahadeo and Yoni.\n\nThe Statistical Survey of India has proceeded steadily during the last year. Of the 234 Districts of India, with their population of more than 200 millions of souls, the whole have now been surveyed, and the statistical accounts for nearly 190 of them have been compiled and printed. These accounts make 77 volumes, with an aggregate of 25,000 closely printed pages. The whole series remains, as before, under Dr. W. W. Hunter, LL.D., the Director General of Statistics. The Statistical Account of Bengal\u2014commencing with the Parganas and Sundarbans, and ending with the Fisheries and Botany of Bengal and General Index, making in all twenty volumes\u2014was published last autumn. The volumes for Assam will be published shortly. It is understood that Dr. Hunter is now revising the whole Survey, and condensing its voluminous records into a compendious alphabetical form, to be called \"The Imperial Gazetteer of India\";\u2014this will require about four volumes. It is to be hoped that the uniform system for\nthe transliteration of Indian names, long since applied by this Society, and, officially, introduced into India by Dr. Hunter for this purpose, will be steadily adhered to. The Government of India has authoritatively accepted it, but some of the local Governments still fail to give effect to it; yet any laxity in this matter will greatly impair the value of an alphabetical work intended for general reference.\n\nVery good work has been done during the last year\u2014in continuation, it is true, of that of former years, in the Reports, from every local centre, and on almost every subject, which have been issued by the Supreme Government or from the separate Presidencies in India. In these can be readily discerned how fully the Government of this Imperial Dependency is prepared to carry out efficiently the duties entrusted to them. The Reports, thus furnished from year to year, exhibit better than anything else could, the material progress of India under her new masters; while many of the individual monographs, such as those of Mr. Morris, Mr. M. G. Ramgade, etc., are worthy of separate perusal and study. In special science, India has well maintained her place: no student of physical science can find better work anywhere than what Colonel Thuillier has done for Indian Topography\u2014and other men of the highest scientific acquirements for the Geological Survey, the Palaeontology Indica, the Natural History of every part, together with the Census of all the Districts over which English influence prevails; and the same may be said of the Forest Administration of British India; the General Reports on Trade; and, above all, of the ample details furnished from nearly every Province, of the Progress of Public Instruction, with the lists of the works printed in each place.\n\nGeneral Progress of Oriental Studies.\u2014Aryan Languages of India.\u2014Sanskrit.\u2014In the field of Sanskrit Studies, there has been no falling off, as compared with last year, though so much\nattention has not been paid to the special class of Vedic Literature as during 1876-7. One of the most important works published is \"A Practical English-Sanskrit Dictionary,\" by Anundaram Borooah, B.A., Calcutta, which, considering the great difficulties of his task, has been well executed, though his book would have been of greater value had he given more fully the references, etc., he must have brought together when compiling his Dictionary. To Mr. Fitz-Edward Hall we owe a valuable Index to the \"Vishnu Purana,\" included in the second half of the tenth volume of the Works of the late Prof. H. H. Wilson. Drs. Boehtlingk and Burnell have continued their valuable labours in the cause of Sanskrit scholarship, the former by the publication of a new edition of his Sanskrit Chrestomathia, which is, indeed, almost a new work; the latter, by printing the Sambhita-panishad Brahmana, and the Jaiminiya text of the Arsheya Brahmana (Mangalore, 1877). There remains now but one more work of this class to print; and, this done, we shall then have accessible all the Brahmanas of the Sama Veda. The object of the Pratisakhya, also discovered by Dr. Burnell, is to show that the Samhita text really rests on the Pada text. The Pratisakhya consists of about 280 sutras with a Commentary, and is attributed to Saktaayana. Dr. Boehtlingk, also, announces a new Sanskrit Dictionary framed on his larger one, with all the words in the former but without the references. References will, however, he states, be added in the case of new words.\n\nRam das Sen, whose valuable work (Aitikasikarahasya, Historical Essays) was noticed in last year's Report, has issued, in conjunction with Vedantesvagisa, \"Sri Kailvara Sarman,\" a new edition of Hemachandra's Sanskrit Dictionary, of which there have been two earlier editions, one at Calcutta in 1807, and the other at St. Petersburg in 1847. In the preface, Ram Das Sen gives some curious extracts from Tanganatha and other Jain writers, who state that Hemachandra lived under Kumaraapala, and dedicated his Dictionary to him. It\nwould seem, also, that another Dictionary, also containing homonyms, is due to him. The Ved\u0101rtha-Yaina, or attempt to interpret the Vedas (now known to be the work of Shankar Pundit), noticed last year, has been continued, and is interesting as showing how much this special study has advanced since the days of Rammohun Roy.\n\nDr. Uday Chand Dutt has published a curious work entitled \"The Materia Medica of the Hindus,\" Calcutta, 1877, following up, successfully, the previous labours of Drs. Royle, Wise, M. Moodeen Sherif, of Madras, and of Dr. Saccaram Arjun, of Bombay.\u2014Dr. King, the Superintendent of the Royal Botanic Gardens, at Calcutta, had added to it a valuable glossary of Indian Plants.\n\nIn the Bibliotheca Indica Mr. Blochmann has issued two more fasciculi of the Ain-i-Akbari, Nos. xx. and xxi.: and Maulawi Abdur-rahim, two more of the Akbar-Namah, vol. ii. parts 1, 2. Of Hem\u0101dri's Chaturvarga Chint\u0101ma\u1e47i, fasc. x. xi. and xii., of vol. ii., have been published: of the \u015a\u0101ma Veda Sanhita with the Commentary of \u015a\u0101yana \u0100ch\u0101rya, vol. iv. pts. 1, 2; and of the Gobilya Grihya Sutra, fasc. vii. Dr. Rajendralal Mitra has also brought to a conclusion his edition of the Aitareya \u0100ranyaka of the Rig-Veda; at the same time procuring, during his tour in the N.W. Provinces, a complete and correct copy of the Nitis\u0101ra of K\u0101mandaki. In the Jain-S\u0101ha-Sangraha, intended as a serial publication, we welcome an enterprise of considerable merit; as, of the Sacred Literature of the Jains, little more is still known than what Prof. H. H. Wilson and Weber and the Rev. J. Stevenson have divulged. Quite recently, some younger scholars, such as S. Goldschmidt, B. Pischel, E. M\u00fcller and H. Jacobi, have entered into this field with great zeal; yet of the texts, little has as yet appeared in print. Mr. John Muir has printed, for private circulation, a third series of \"Miscellaneous Extracts, metrically and freely translated or paraphrased from the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\":\u2014and Prof. Cowell has\ncompleted the *Jaimintya-Ny\u0101ya-M\u0101la-Vistara* of *Madhavacch\u0101rya*, for the Sanskrit Text Society, for which a commencement was made by the late T. Goldst\u00fccker. *Inter alia* we may mention that Dr. Rajendralala Mitra, who has recently published an Introduction to the \"Lalita Vistara,\" has presented to the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions, ninety-three Sanskrit MSS., and that chairs for Sanskrit have been founded at Madrid and Lisbon. At the former city, M. Rivero has been appointed Professor; at the latter, M. de Vasconcellos-Abreu, the author of a work \"Sobre originaria de gente Arica,\" the first publication in Portugal of anything Sanskritical. At Paris, also, M. Bergaigne has been appointed by Mr. Waddington to a chair of Sanskrit; M. Georgian, also, a pupil of Prof. Weber at Berlin, has returned to his native country, Bucharest, and commenced a course of lectures on Sanskrit there in November last.\n\nBy an extract from the Proceedings of the Governor-General in Council, dated Feb. 9, 1878, just to hand, a complete view is given of all that has been done in India, in each of the Presidencies, respectively, since Nov., 1868, with the view of collecting Sanskrit MSS., or, at all events, of ascertaining where they are at present, the chief officers employed for this purpose having been, in Bengal, Rajendralala Mitra; in Madras, Dr. Burnell; and, in Bombay, Dr. B\u00fchler. In Bengal, Rajendralala Mitra has, already, published twelve Reports on the Sanskrit MSS. still in Bengal; while the results from Bombay have been equally satisfactory. In the N.W. Provinces, too, similar good work has been done by Mr. Griffiths, of Delhi, who has printed Part I. of a Catalogue of those obtained by him. A suggestion, made by General Cunningham, has also been adopted, and the MSS. at Jezailmir and Bikanir have been examined by either Dr. B\u00fchler or Dr. Kielhorn. Subsequently, this search has been extended, chiefly by Dr. B\u00fchler, to Gujarat, Rajputana, Lahore, Delhi and other towns of Northern and Western India.\u2014In the case of\nDr. Burnell's Catalogue of the Tanjore MSS., much delay has been caused by the difficulty of procuring types for eleven different alphabets; he hopes, however, to be able shortly to issue the first part of this Catalogue. In Oudh, Mr. Nesfield reports on the progress made, but it would seem that libraries of importance are rare in this part of India, and that Sanskrit literature is fast dying out there.\u2014From Rajputana, Dr. B\u00fchler reported that he had examined the Catalogue of Sanskrit MSS., about 1400 in number, in the Library of the Maharajah of Bikanir, compiled (with the exception of 200) by the late Hurish Chunder Shashtri; a catalogue he considered would serve very well as the basis for a future publication. The Report concludes by stating that \"the general results obtained are, in the opinion of the Government of India, such as warrant the prosecution of the search.\"\n\nAs separate works may be mentioned:\n\nHildebrand.\u2014Varuna und Mitra.

F. Deloncle;\u2014the publication by Dr. Leitner of the second volume of his History of Muhammedanism written in Urdu; and that the Quran has been printed in Roman-Urdu, with an Introd. by the Rev.

H., Two Centuries of Bhartrihari (Ind. Ant.). The first vol. of Tulsi Das's Ramayana has, also, been translated by G. Browse, Bengal O.S.\n\nNon-Aryan Languages of India.\u2014The most important work on this subject during the last year has been the paper by Mr. Brandreth in the Journal of this Society (Vol. X. Part I.), to which allusion has already been made.\u2014To M. Vinson, we also owe \"Le Verbe dans les Langues Dravidiennes,\" and a paper in the Revue de Linguistique, vol. x., entitled, \"La Conjugaison dans les Langues Dravidiennes.\"\u2014Mr. G. B. Mahuwarang has, also, published a valuable sketch of the Grammar of the Rong or Lepcha language.\u2014The Government of Bengal has, also, requested the Rev. Mr. Skrefsrud to prepare a Comparative Grammar of the Kolarian languages, of which the Santhali and Moonda are the most conspicuous\u2014and Major J. M. D. Smith, of the Madras Staff Corps, has published a Practical Handbook of the Khond language.\n\nFour thousand songs in Tamil have been presented by a native to the Library at Strasbourg: and, Mr. Fleet's careful decipherment of the Old Canarese Inscriptions will be noticed under \"Epigraphy.\"\u2014We may add, here, that the publication of two maps of the Non-Aryan Languages of India by Messrs. Brandreth and Cust, in the January and February numbers of the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, is an attempt to prepare correct language\nANNUAL REPORT OF THE\n\nmaps, as a first contribution to a Language Atlas. It is proposed to deal in the same way with Africa, S. America, and with the Non-Slavonic territories of Russia in Europe.\n\nTibet and Central Asia.\u2014The following books or papers may be cited as bearing on this subject:\u2014Tomaschek, W., Central-Asiatische Studien : Sogdiana, with 3 maps.

Feer has printed in the Journal Asiatique, vol. ix. pt. 2, under the title of \"Etudes Cambodgiens,\" a very full description of the \"Collection Hennecart,\" now in the \"Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale\" at Paris. M. Hennecart was, for some years, attached, as medical officer, to the French Mission in Cambodia, and devoted himself, inter alia, to the collecting MSS. and other matters connected with that country. The collection thus made by him consists of two principal classes: 1. Palm-leaf MSS. procured by him in the country; and 2. MSS. copied for him from time to time. M. Hennecart has, also, left a list of Cambodian plants, the more valuable, that they have their native as well as European botanical names.\u2014M. Alex. Lubavsky has printed an useful work for Cochin China called \"Rapport sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 pour les Fran\u00e7ais d'\u00e9tudier la Cochin Chine, Siam et Annam.\"\u2014The Rev. R. E. Neighbor, also, has published a Vocabulary of the Mikri language, one of the dialects of the tribes bordering on the Assam valley;\u2014M. Miklucho-Maklay, \"Notes on the Papuas and their Language\";\u2014\nand the Count de Montblanc, \"Les Iles Philippines,\" with a brief grammar of Tagalog, which he considers to be the original type of Malay. Prof. Van der Tuuk has been employed by the Dutch Government in preparing a Dictionary of Kawi, the archaic language of Java, and of Balinese, the modern language of the islands of Bali and Lampung. For this purpose, he has already resided in Bali for several years.\n\nOther works on this head that may be noted are:\u2014Des Michels, Chu nom Annam; Dictionnaire Pratique de la Langue Annamite, texte et translation:\u2014M.

Mr. Whitmee is preparing, at the expense of Government, a complete Polynesian Dictionary, some portion of which will probably be published soon;\u2014Mr. Houlden has published at\nANNUAL REPORT OF THE\n\narrivo (Madagascar), an interesting missionary tour:\u2014\ntens of myths or folk-lore have been translated from the\nJagasy by Miss Cameron.\u2014The Rev. W. Wyatt Gill,\nving returned to his former duties, is now exploring the\nvery Islands, we may hope with valuable results, linguistic\nas well as other;\u2014and, in the \"Annales de l'Extr\u00eame\nOrient,\" is a useful paper by Count Meyners d'Estrey,\n\"On Dutch Colonies and Polynesia\";\u2014M. A. Fornander\nhas published, also, \"Origin and Migrations of the Poly-\nnesian Race,\" vol. i.;\u2014and Ridley, W., \"Kamilaroi\" and\nother Australian Languages. It may be added that the\n\"Bataviasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen,\"\nwhich was started in 1778, six years before Sir W. Jones\nfounded the Asiatic Society of Bengal (and is, therefore, the\noldest Society, the object of which is the study of Eastern\nLiterature and Antiquities, especially for the Eastern Archi-\npelago), celebrated the Centenary of its foundation on the 24th\nof April last. It is a matter of regret that Batavia, being so\nfar off, it was not possible for the sister societies in Europe to\ndo more than to send congratulatory letters.\n\nChinese.\u2014The following may be noticed as among the more\nimportant works or papers published in connexion with Chinese\nliterature during the last year\u2014\n\nStock, E.\u2014The Story of the Fah-hien Mission of the\nChurch Missionary Society.

Gr\u00fcnwald has recently published \"Etudes Alta\u00efques, Classification de langages en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral,\" in \"L'Extr\u00eame Orient,\" and a \"Grammar Samoiede\" in the \"Revue de Philologie\"; and in the same periodical M. Rodet has published \"Le Touran et les Toumaniens, suivant la tradition Persane,\" and Capt. Raverty two articles on \"Mughals versus Mongols\" and on \"Jingis Khan and Mongols Proper\" in the Athen\u00e6um. In Turkish we may notice the late M. Belin's \"Bibliographie Ottomane\" in Journ. Asiatique; \u2014 a new edition of Mr. Redhouse's Turkish Vade-Mecum; \u2014 by Nur-Bey, \"Dictionnaire de poche Fran\u00e7ais et Turc\"; \u2014 Mad. Dora d'Istria, \"La Poesie des Ottomans,\" 2de ed.; \u2014 and two very important works by Mr. Shaw, both published first in the J. Beng. As. Soc., and, since, separately, the first \"On the Shigni or Ghalehah Dialect,\" the second \"A Grammar of the Language of Eastern Turkestan.\" Mr. Shaw justly remarks on the curious linguistic fact that these rude nomads of Central Asia who, in their own home, have never known how to reduce\nit to rule, or to distinguish the laws through which they had unconsciously formed it, should present a language which is an example of symmetry in complexity which few, if any, of the more cultivated forms of speech exhibit. The study of Eastern Turki has an interest not to be measured by the amount of the commercial or other intercourse likely to be facilitated by it.\n\nM. Bianconi has published a useful work with the title of \"Ethnographie et Statistique de la Turquie d'Europe et de la Gr\u00e8ce.\" Other works are,\n\nVambery, H.\u2014Aus Ost-Turkestan (Mon. f. Orient. Sept., 1877).\n\nRitter von Helle, A.\u2014V\u00f6lker des Osmanischen Reiches, Beitr\u00e4ge zur F\u00f6rderung Orientalischen Studien. Ibid.\n\nSemitic Literature.\u2014The work of the last year has been quite satisfactory, and we have again to report steady progress.\n\nHebrew.\u2014The Rev. Mr. Ball, of Merchant Taylors' School, has brought out a grammar for beginners, which is, on the whole, well done\u2014though perhaps, considering for what class of students it is intended, the many comparisons in it are scarcely needed and may mislead. To Mr. Curtiss, the author of an Essay on the name of Maccabee, we owe a translation of Prof. Bickell's Grammar, to which Dr. Euting, of Strassbourg, has added an elaborate Table of all the Semitic alphabets in their various forms. Dr. Bacher has published a learned article on Ibn Ezra's Commentary on the Pentateuch, in the Transactions of the Academy of Vienna; and a critical text from MSS. and old editions of the same celebrated author's Commentary on Isaiah has been brought out by Dr. Friedl\u00e4nder, together with a volume of Essays on the writings of the same author, for the Society of Hebrew Literature in London. In the Miscellany of Hebrew Literature, published by the same Society, under the careful editing of the\nRev. A. L\u00f6wy, are papers by the Rev. F. de Sola Mendes, \"On the Life and Labours of Manasseh ben Israel, being a contribution to the History of the Jews in England from Original Sources\";\u2014by Dr. A. Benisch, \"On the Sons of the Prophets and the Prophetic Schools\";\u2014by Thomas Chenery, M.A., \"Legends from the Midrash\";\u2014by A. Neubauer, \"On the Hebrew Translations of L'Image du Monde\";\u2014and by H. J. Matthews, M.A., \"On Abraham Ibn Ezra's Short Commentary on Daniel, now edited for the first time from MSS.\" The late Dr. Luzzatto's Grammar of the Biblical-Chaldaic Language has been translated and published in America; together with the posthumous notes, in Hebrew, on the Prophets, by the same eminent Paduan Professor.\n\nIn the Bolletino degli Studi Orientali, Prof. Guidi, of Rome, has many good remarks on Grammar and Massorah; and, in the same Journal, are extracts and descriptions of Rabbinical MSS, by Dr. Steinschneider.\n\nM. Rabinowicz has carried on his \"Variae Lectiones\" to the eighth part; Dr. Levy's Talmudical Lexicon has reached to the end of the letter Yod; and the Rev. C. Taylor's critical ed. of the \"Sayings of the Jewish Fathers\" (Aboth) with Translation and Notes, especially with reference to the New Testament, has recently appeared. In Dr. Brill's Annual for Hebrew Literature is an interesting Essay by him on the Apocryphal Book of Susanna: and the Chaldee Text of the Book of Tobit has been lately discovered by Mr. Neubauer in the Bodleian Library. In the twenty-seventh volume of the Histoire Litteraire de la France, under the editorship of M. Renan, more than 300 pages are devoted to the French Rabbis of the fourteenth century. This Essay has since been published separately with the title, \"Les Rabbins Fran\u00e7ais du Commencement du Quatorzi\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle\"\u2014a very considerable portion of the materials for it having been collected by the indefatigable diligence of Mr. Neubauer, and transmitted by him to the French Commission.\nNotices of other Rabbinical MSS. may be found in different Continental periodicals;\u2014in the pages of Dr. Berliner's Magazine;\u2014by Dr. Kohn, of Buda-Pesth, in the Hungarian Bibliographical periodical, from MSS. in the Library of the Museum of that town;\u2014by Dr. Lagarde, in his Summicta, from MSS. at Erfurt;\u2014by Dr. Landauer and others, in the Letterbode, a Dutch periodical for Hebrew literature, wherein are also some curious, and hitherto unedited, poems by Samuel Prince of Cordova.\n\nThe Monatschrift, edited by Dr. Graetz, has some remarkable notes by the editor on some of the Psalms;\u2014on the Queen of Adiabene and St. Paul; and on some historical documents of the last century B.C., as well as on the geography of Palestine, such as the position of Bezetha at Jerusalem. With the last may be noticed the late Dr. Lebrecht's Essay on Bethar, the last stronghold of Bar-chokbaas, which he identifies with Sepphoris in Galilee; and M. Clermont-Ganneau's observations on the town of Yeshanah, and on other places on the Dead Sea. Dr. Kauffmann has published a learned work on the Theory of the Attributes of God from Saadiya Gaon (tenth cent.) to Maimonides; and M. Schloesberg has edited the second part of Hariri's Hebrew Translation of Maimonides' \"Guide to the Perplexed.\" From the Monatschrift we may add, a detailed account by Dr. Gutmann of the Philosophy of Abraham ben Dior of Toledo; and, also, an exhaustive Essay on Mordecai ben Hillel by Dr. Kohn.\n\nDr. Berliner has published the Targum Onkelos, and proposes hereafter to issue a critical edition of it;\u2014Dr. L. Munk has given a new critical edition of the Second Targum on Esther;\u2014the Rab. Jehudah Berkowitz has published a pamphlet in Hebrew, called \"Abne Ziyyon,\" with criticisms on the Chief Rabbi's Commentary on the Targum of Onkelos. Dr. Davidson has edited a fourth edition of Furst's Hebrew Lexicon; and Mr. J. Muir has printed his translation of Dr. Kuemen's work, \"On the Five Books of Moses.\"\nIt may be mentioned here that, at the Meeting for the Fourth Centenary of the University of Tubingen, a photolithographic reproduction of the work of Conrad Pellican, \"De Modo Legendi et Intelligendi Hebraeum,\" was exhibited. This is the first Hebrew Grammar written by a Christian and also the first book printed with Hebrew type in Germany. It had been long supposed to be hopelessly lost, but was found in 1875, in the Library of the British Museum, by Dr. E. Nesle.\n\nThe following books or papers may also be noted:\n\nBuddensieg, R.\u2014Zur charakteric der Hebr\u00e4ischen Poetie nach ihrer materiellen seite (Allg. Augsb. Zeitung, p. 105, II).\n\nGratz, H.\u2014Ein \u00fcberschneites Verbun in Alt-Hebr\u00e4ischen Sprach-gut (Monats, f. Gesch. d.

M\u00fchlau and Volck.\n\nDr. A. Kohat is printing a critical edition of the Talmudic and Midrashic Texts (of the eleventh century) called Aruch:\u2014M. Baron de Ville Fosse has completed \"Notice sur les Monuments provenant de la Palestine et conserv\u00e9e au Mus\u00e9e du Louvre.\"\u2014Mr. Neubauer has published the Chaldee Text of the Book of Tobit, with Rabbinical texts, translations, etc.\u2014M. Darmesteter has issued \"Glosses ou Glossaires Hebreux-Fran\u00e7ais,\" and M. Hollanderske \"Dictionnaire Univers. Fran\u00e7.-Hebreu.\"\u2014M. Bickell has written (in the Zeitschr. fur\nKathol. Theologie) a paper in which he discusses \"the Chaldee text of Tobit with reference to Mr. Neubauer's discovery of the Chaldee Text used by St. Jerome.\" A very interesting work has been published by Mr. J. Cohen entitled, \"Les Pharisiens,\" which has been well noticed in the \"Jewish Chronicle.\"\u2014In connexion with Jewish studies it must be added that Mr. L\u00f6wy has quite recently given (under the title of \"Kurdish Folk-Lore in the Kurdo-Jewish Dialect\") at a Meeting of the Bibl. Arch. Society, a very curious and valuable account of the Lishanat Imr\u00e1ni or Djabai,\u2014the Imr\u00e1ni or Highland language to which allusion was made in last year's Report.\n\nArabic.\u2014We hail with pleasure the completion of another part (the sixth of vol. i.) of the late Mr. Lane's great Arabic Dictionary, which is now edited by his great-nephew, Mr. Stanley Lane Poole; and the publication by M. Dozy of the two first fasciculi of his \"Supplement aux Dictionnaires Arabes,\" a work that cannot be too highly appreciated, based as it is on the latest publications of the Arabico-Spanish vocabularies as well as on a mass of matter yet in MS.\u2014M. Davie has brought out a useful and valuable work entitled, \"Dictionnaire Etymologique des Mots Fran\u00e7ais d'Origine Orientale.\"\u2014Prof. Dieterici has given in the D. M. Ges. a preliminary article on the Pseudo-theology of Aristotle, and promises to publish the Arabic text from a MS. at Berlin, with a German translation. Another MS. of this work is in the Paris Library, and has been noticed by M. Munk in his \"Philosophie Juive et Arabe.\"\n\nM. Lucien Gautier of Lausanne has devoted much learning to a careful edition of Ghazzali's Treatise on Eschatology, and has greatly increased the value of his work by an excellent translation into French; and M. Barbier de Meynard has published in the Journal Asiatique another treatise by the same writer, called the \"Preservative against Error.\" Of this work M. Renan says, \"Il n'y a pas dans toute la\nphilosophie d'Arabe de livre plus digne d'\u00eatre lu.\" In the same Journal, as already noticed, M. Guyard, whose work, \"Sur la Metrique Arabe,\" was alluded to in a former Report, has published an able Essay, entitled, \"Un Grand Ma\u00eetre des Assassins,\" which has much interest as elucidating some obscure points in the history of the sect of the Ansairi or Ismaelians, and also for the Historians of the Crusades. Other papers more or less connected with Arabic literature have appeared in the D. M. Ges. from MM. Kremer, A. M\u00fcller, Steinschneider, Noldeke and Sprenger.\n\nA good deal has been done in the way of Bibliography. Thus, Dr. Euting has published the Catalogue of the Arabic Books in the University Library at Strasbourg:\u2014the India Office, a Catalogue of the Arabic MSS., compiled by Dr. Loth of Leipzig:\u2014Prof. de Goeje, the third part of his Bibl. Geograph. Arab., containing an account of the Empire of the Moslems of Al-Magadassi:\u2014Dr. Pertzsch, Die Arab. MSS. der Herz. Bibliothek zu Gotha:\u2014The Baron v. Rosen, The Arabic MSS. at St. Petersburg in \"Collections Scientifiques de l'Institut des Langues Orientales,\" part i.:\u2014Prof. Barack, A Catalogue of the University Library at Strasbourg, Arabische Literatur:\u2014M. Steinschneider has given a Bibliography of Jewish, Christian, and Muhammadan Controversy in Arabic, a work of much value, though not so useful as it might be, had the arrangement been more simple, and a general and exhaustive index supplied.\u2014The Fourth Book of Ezra has been republished by Prof. Gildemeister from a MS. in the Vatican; the previous edition of the late Prof. Ewald having been made from one in the Bodleian.\u2014Prof. Guidi has contributed to the Transactions of the Societ\u00e0 Romana di Storia Patria, a description of Rome by Arabic Geographers:\u2014and M. l'Abb\u00e9 Barg\u00e9s has published, with a French translation, an Arabic Translation from the Coptic of a Homily for the Feast of St. Mark, composed by Severus, Bishop of Nesteraweh, in Lower Egypt. Severus professes to have learnt some particu-\nlars about St. Mark through the agency of a vision by night, but as this author lived so late as the ninth century, M. Barg\u00e9s considers the document as unhistorical. The editor has added some other pretended historical pieces concerning St. Mark by Severus. M. Catafago has published a Romance in popular Arabic, called, \"The Autobiography of the Constantinopolitan Story-Teller,\" a useful reading-book for exercise in the spoken language.\n\nThe following works may also be mentioned:\u2014Dr. Van der Harn, Disputatio pro Religione Muhammedanorum adversus Christianos, Text Arab.;\u2014Girgas, W.

Wien.\nWe have the pleasure, also, of announcing that the translation, by Prof. Sachau, of Albiruni's As\u00e1r-al-B\u00e1kyd, or Book of Eras, is now in the press, and will, shortly, be published; and that his T\u00e1rikh-i-Hind, or History of India, with which this Society is more immediately interested, is completed to the extent of about one-half, and will follow the other treatise.\n\nSyriac.\u2014The most important work of the year is the continuation of Prof. Payne Smith's \"Thesaurus Syriacus,\" which has now reached the letter Teth. Abroad, Messrs. Abelooos and Lamy have brought out the third and last part of the Ecclesiastical Chronicle of Bar-Hebraeus, with an accurate translation (from MSS. at Oxford, Cambridge, and the British Museum respectively) and a good Index.\u2014The Maronite Father, August Scebah, of Aleppo, has also made public, at Rome, the poems of Bar-Hebraeus, with an Arabic and Latin Glossary.\u2014In the Transactions of the German Oriental Society, Dr. Imm. L\u00f6w has given some valuable notes to Bickell's Kalilag ve Dimnag; and Prof. N\u00f6ldeke has written on the same subject. Drs. Bernstein and Kirsch have, also, brought out a Syrian Chrestomathy. In France, M. Zotenberg has edited the symbolical sentences of Theodosius, Patriarch of Antioch, towards the end of the ninth century, the originals of which were probably Greek. M. l'Abb\u00e9 Martin has not been idle, but has continued to study his favourite subject, Syriac Punctuation; and has, also, published a treatise on it, by Bar-Zugbi. Besides the Treatise of the Maronite Priest, Petrus Aldensis, M. l'Abb\u00e9 Martin has given a sketch of Syriac Studies in the second volume of the \"Congr\u00e8s International des Orientalistes\" at Paris. In the same volume, also, are valuable notes by Prof. Albert Socin, on Syriac dialects still in use. Dr. Nestle is editing a \"Psalterium Tetraglosson,\" in which the Targum and the Syriac version appear side by side. The first fasciculus contains the first fifty Psalms.\nEthiopic and Himyaritic.\u2014We owe to the exertions of an English scholar, again, the most important work that has been achieved in this branch of Semitic studies, viz. the Catalogue of the Ethiopic MSS. in the British Museum, by Prof. W. Wright. Dr. Wright has also assisted Dr. Hommel in the edition he has brought out of the Ethiopic translation of the \"Physiologus\"\u2014a book of natural science quoted by Clemens and Origen\u2014with a German translation and notes. Prof. Dillmann, of Berlin, with the use of the MSS. in the British Museum, has given to the world a critical edition, with a Latin translation, of the apocryphal book, called the \"Ascensio Isaiae,\" published, originally, many years since by Archbishop Lawrence. M. Halevy has edited, as no one better than he could edit, with an excellent Hebrew translation, some prayers of the Falashas, in Gheez; this copy, M. Halevy brought with him from Abyssinia, whither he went on a mission for the Alliance Isra\u00e9lite in 1868. It is clear from these prayers that the Falashas believe in the Unity of God, exactly as the Jews do. To M. Halevy we are also indebted for a very interesting account of his travels in Abyssinia, which have been translated from the French into English by James Pieriotto, and published by the Society of Hebrew Literature. It may be here, also, added, that at p. 178 of the \"Miscellany of Jewish Literature\" will be found a complete list of M. Halevy's works.\u2014Dr. Schr\u00f6ter publishes in the Trans. Germ. Or. Society, Trotzschrieben Jacobe von Sarug und die Himyaritischen Christen\u2014and J. H. Mordtmann, Misceller zur Himyarische Alterthumskunde.\u2014Before the Soc. Kh\u00e9diviale de Geogr. M. Brugsch Bay has recently read a paper \"On the Language of the Barabora or ancient Ethiopians, in its relation to the language of the Egyptian Hieroglyphs and to Coptic, Arabic and Greek.\"\n\nAssyriaca.\u2014The studies of all matters appertaining to the Cuneiform inscriptions, whether in the languages of Nineveh, of\nVan, of Babylon, or of Accad, have made satisfactory progress during the last year, though it is likely that the deaths of Messrs. Fox Talbot and Rosanquet may for a while delay, in England, the publication of some valuable texts with the accompanying translations. On the whole, however, there has been no falling off in the number or the value of the papers printed on this subject. Thus the Society of Biblical Archaeology, in vol. v. part 2, of their Transactions, have printed papers by the Rev. W. Houghton, \"On the Mammalia of the Assyrian Sculptures, part 2\";\u2014by the late Mr. Fox Talbot, \"The Chaldean Account of the Creation\";\u2014and by the Rev. A. Sayce, \"On the Babylonian Cylinders found by General di Cesnola in the Treasury of the Temple of Kurium.\" At various meetings of the Society the following papers have also been read:\u2014By Mr. Boscawen, \"On a Collection of Babylonian dated Contract Tablets,\" referring to a great Banking Firm at Babylon, of which, in the reign of Sennacherib, Egibi was the head. The tablets, about 2,500 in number, were procured by Mr. Smith at Baghdad in 1876. They had been found, during the winter of 1875\u20136 in the neighbourhood of Hillah on the Euphrates, preserved in some common earthenware jars. Mr. Sayce alluded to the contents of the inscriptions on these \"Egibi\" tablets in his third lecture at the Royal Institution (see Report, 1877, p. lxvi).\u2014By the late Mr. Fox Tablet, \"The Defence of a Magistrate falsely accused, from a tablet in the British Museum.\"\u2014By the Rev. W. Houghton, M.A., F.R.S., \"On some further desired Aids to the Study of Assyrian.\"\u2014By M. Fran\u00e7ois Lenormant, \"On the reading and signification of the Accadian Ideogram AS, and, incidentally, on certain Names of Diseases in Akkadian and Assyrian.\"\u2014By Mr. Boscawen, \"On some Early Babylonian and Akkadian Antiquities,\" referring chiefly to a series of early Babylonian monuments which have been found in the mounds of Zerghoul in Southern Babylonia. A Notice was also given of a Monarch named Gudea who built a temple\nANNUAL REPORT OF THE [May,\n\nand of whom there exists at the British Museum inscribed statue in black marble.\u2014By T. G. Pinches, \"On Assyrian Dispatch and Report Tablets,\" a class of documents which have not been hitherto very fully examined, but which are of much interest from the insight they give into the language of the common people, as they are not the productions of the Court-scribes, though probably written from dictation.\n\n\u2014By Dr. Jules Oppert, \"A Revised Chronology of the latest Babylonian Kings,\" with a Canon from B.C. 561 to B.C. 485, that is, from the accession of Evil-Merodach to the death of Darius.\u2014By Fran\u00e7ois Lenormant, \"On the Names of Brass and Copper in the Cuneiform Languages of Chaldea and Assyria.\" If M. Lenormant be right in supposing id-kasdu\u0161u to mean \"tin,\" an interesting connexion would seem to be established with the Sanskrit kastira and the Greek \u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, the original root of the word being probably of Aryan origin.\n\nIn the \"Records of the Past,\" vol. ix, we find papers by M. Jules Oppert \"On the great Inscription of the Palace of Khorsabad\";\u2014by the same scholar, \"Inscriptions of the Persian monarchs\";\u2014by MM. Oppert and Menant, conjointly, \"Babylonian Public Documents\";\u2014by T. G. Pinches, \"The Bavian Inscription of Sennacherib\";\u2014by the Rev. J. M. Rodwell, \"Inscription of Merodach Baladan\";\u2014by the late G. Smith, \"Annals of Ashur-banipal\";\u2014by the Rev. A. Sayce, \"Accadian Poem on the Seven Evil Spirits\";\u2014by the same scholar, \"Fragment of an Assyrian Prayer after a Bad Dream\";\u2014by W. St. Chad Boscawen, \"The Twelfth Indubar Legend\";\u2014and by the late H. Fox Talbot, \"Chaldean Account of the Creation\"; \"Ishtar and Indubar\"; and \"The Fight between Bel and the Dragon.\"\n\nMr. Sayce has published his \"Lectures on the Assyrian Language and Syllabary,\" together with a revised edition of his Assyrian Grammar;\u2014the lectures \"On Babylonian Literature\" he delivered last year at the Royal Institution;\n\"Accadian Phonology,\" in Trans. Philol. Soc.; \u2014 an interesting paper \"On Babylonian Chronology,\" in Academy, Aug. 4, 1877; \u2014 he has also edited and completed, for the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, Mr. George Smith's \"History of Babylonia,\" which was left unfinished at Mr. Smith's untimely death. \u2014 Abroad: Mr. Hommel has published in the D. Morgl. Ges. vol. xxxii. 2, \"Die Neueren Resultate der Sumerischen Forschung\"; \u2014 M. Lenormant, two vols., \"On Assyrian Syllabaries\"; \u2014 in the Revue Arch\u00e9ologique, a magical Accadian text, under the title \"La Magie chez les Chald\u00e9ens,\" and \"Les Dieux de Babylone et de l'Assyrie.\" \u2014 M. Oppert has issued \"Die Daten von Genesis,\" Gotting, May, 1877; \u2014 \"Solomon et ses Successeurs\" (Annal. d. Philol. Chr\u00e9t.); \u2014 \"Origine de la Chronologie Cosmogonique des Chald\u00e9ens,\" etc., ibid. We notice that M. Oppert still insists on the incorrectness of the views of other Assyrian scholars, who call the oldest Inscriptions Accadian rather than Sumerian. \u2014 Prof. Lepsius, in the Berlin Transactions, contributes a valuable paper \"On the Babylonico-Assyrian Measurements of Length\" \u2014 and Prof. Schrader in the same Transactions, one, \"On Sibilants in Assyrian.\"\n\nThe British Museum has, during the last few months, become possessed of two invaluable collections of Assyrian and Babylonian Antiquities, the first, that mainly obtained by Mr. George Smith or through his instrumentality; among which is a bilingual inscription (Accadian and Babylonian) of an early monarch named Hammuragas, B.C. 1650, and among the new \"Contract Tablets,\" one said to bear the name of Barziya or Bardes (Gomates the Magian), from Van, secured by the zeal of Mr. Layard. These monuments are chiefly in bronze, and the more valuable for this reason \u2014 that from the inscription found on one of them they may be presumed to date from about B.C. 703. \u2014 It is satisfactory also to be able to report that Mr. Hormazd Rassam, having been furnished with a new firman through the energetic instrumentality of Mr.\nLayard, is now again actively employed in excavating the mounds of Assyria. His attention has been hitherto chiefly directed to a mound named Balavat (Bel-abad or \"abode of Bel\" of the Gwyruphus), near Karamlis, where there seems to have been a Palace or Temple of Asshur-nasir-pal, the builder of the great Palace at Nimrud or Calah. It is most satisfactory to be able to add that news of Mr. Rassam's complete success has just reached England, and that the discoveries he has made are of the most interesting kind. They consist chiefly of two monuments in copper, on which are embossed battle scenes, domestic amusements, and religious ceremonies. The larger of the two monuments must have been 20 ft. high originally. Mr. Rassam has, also, procured from Koyunjik a very fine Cylinder, containing 1300 lines of Assyrian writing.\n\nIt is further to be noted that the Trustees of the British Museum have appointed Mr. Pinches, a promising young Assyriologist, to fill the place of the late Mr. George Smith in the Department of Antiquities at our National Collection, and have, at the same time, decided to employ him, under Sir H. Rawlinson's supervision, in preparing the plates for a fifth volume of the Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia, which may accordingly be expected to appear in the course of the next year, to the great advantage of those engaged in Assyrian studies.\n\nThe following works or papers are worthy of record:\u2014Delitsch, F., Inaugural Lecture \"On Cuneiform Researches and the Bible,\" Leipzig, March 2;\u2014Friederici, \"Die Assyriologie und ihre Ergebnisse f\u00fcr vergleichende Religionsgeschichte\";\u2014Prof. Tiele, \"Inaugural Address on the Contributions of Assyrian Research to the Science of Religion\";\u2014Oppert, J., \"Die Maase von Senkereh und Khorsabad,\" Monatsb. d. Kon. Akad. zu Berlin, Dec. 1877.\n\nThe Archaic Classes for the Study of Egyptian and Assyrian have been held this year for the fourth season in the house of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, and lectures,\nwhich have been well attended, have been given by Mr. Le Page Renouf and Mr. Roscawen.\n\nUnder Miscellaneous Semitic, we may notice a paper by M. Deecke in the Trans. of the Germ. Or. Soc. on the origin or derivation of the Phoenician Alphabet, which has led to a good deal of controversy, and has been, by no means, generally accepted; and a second paper by the same writer, \"On the Origin of the Semitic Alphabet and on the Connexion between the Indian and the South Semitic Alphabets,\" which opens a very wide field for discussion. To these may be added, Lagarde, P. de, Semitica, part 1; \u2014 M\u00fcller, A., Semitische Leluh-worter in \u00e4lteren Griechisch (Bezz. Indo-Germ. 1, 4); \u2014 and T. W. M. Philippi, Das zahlwort zwei in Semetisch (D. Morg. Gee. xxii. 1).\n\nEgyptology.\u2014The Egyptologists have not been less active this year than on former occasions, and we have therefore to record the publication of several works of value and of many able papers. Thus in the Trans. of the Soc. Bibl. Arch. vol. v. part 2, is a paper by M. Maspero, \"On the St\u00e8le C. in the Museum of the Louvre;\" while, at the Meetings of the Society, papers on subjects connected with Egypt have been read by Mr. Hyde Clarke, by M. Revillout, and by Miss Gertrude Austin. In the Transactions of the German Oriental Society, xxx. 2, 3, is a valuable paper by M. Ebers entitled, \"Das Grab und die Biographie des Feld-Hauptmanns Amen-em-heb,\" and in xxxi. 4 (continued in xxxii. 1), by Wiedemann, \"Geschichte d. xviii. Egypt. Dynastie bis zum tote Tutmes III.\": also, in the Journal Asiatique, x. 2, by Maspero, \"Le Prince predestin\u00e9,\" from the Harris Papyrus. To Dr. Birch we owe an interesting notice of an Ostrakon or tile preserved in the Museum at Liverpool, and containing a portion of Egyptian history in Greek (Athen. No. 2595): and a translation of the Inscription on the so-called Cleopatra's Needle (ibid. No. 2609). In the first and fifth vols. of the\nHay Collection of Illustrations of Egyptian Antiquities, now in the British Museum, are excellent drawings of this and other obelisks, before their removal from their native home. None of these drawings have been published, and they are the more interesting as they show the state of the monuments fifty years since. In connexion with this obelisk it may be added that Mr. Dixon discovered recently on one of the copper cramps at the base of the Needle a bilingual Inscription in Greek and Latin, showing that it had been erected in the eighth year of the reign of Augustus (A.D. 22), by an architect named Pontius, and during the prefecture of P. Babrius Barbarus.\n\nM. Lenormant has reprinted from the Bolletino della Commissione Archeol. Communale di Roma, an interesting article, entitled, Frammento di uno dei Pastori in Egitto, the upper portion of an Egyptian statue, discovered in the grounds of the Villa Ludovisi. It is not unlikely that it may have originally been brought from Egypt to ornament the gardens of Sallust. M. Lenormant shows, by a comparison with the monuments found by Mariette-Bey, that this statuette must have been erected by one of the Shepherd or Hyksos Princes. As there is much difference of physiognomy from those which characterize the Semitic race, M. Lenormant suggests that the Hyksos chiefs may have been really Turanian Akkadians from Babylonia, driven westward by the Semitic invasion of their country.\n\nM. de Harrack has edited for the first time the Shai en Sensen, or \"Livre des Respirations,\" from the Louvre Papyrus, No. 3,284, with a translation into French and an analysis. Denon gave a facsimile of this MS. in his \"Voyage dans la Basse et la Haute Egypte,\" and M. Brugsch again edited it in 1851, but the MS. in the Berlin Museum is incomplete. The composition of the book is not earlier than the twenty-sixth Dynasty, and the contents differ considerably from the earlier Book of the Dead.\nThe British Museum has acquired an interesting fragment of papyrus, containing the fifty-fourth and fifty-fifth years of Rameses the Great.\n\nThe following books may also be noticed as referring to Egyptian matters:\n\nBergmann, Dr. E. v.\u2014Das Buch von durchwandeln der Ewigkeit nach dem Papyrus 29 der K.

Asiat. his \"\u00c9tudes Avestiques.\"\u2014M. Olshausen has given \"Beitr\u00e4ge zur erkl\u00e4rung und berichtigung d. Pahlavi glossaire\" (Monats.d. Kais. Akad. Berlin), and M. Darmesteter, who has been lately appointed the first Zend Professor in Paris, has undertaken the translation of the Zend-Avesta for Prof. Max M\u00fcller's proposed Translation of Sacred Works.\u2014Dr. Eth\u00e9's Catalogue is in the press.\n\nArmenian.\u2014In Armenian may be mentioned F. M\u00fcller, Ueber die Stellung d. Armenischen im Kreise d. Indo-Germanisch. Sprachen (S. d. Kais. Akad. Wien, lxxxiv.);\u2014F. Schweiger-Lerchenfeld, Zur V\u00f6lker-stellung d. Armenier (Mon. f. d. Orient. Dec. 1877);\u2014Hubschmann, Report on Armenian, Phil. Soc. 1877-9, Part 1.\n\nNumismatics.\u2014Several valuable works or papers have been published during the last year on this subject. Thus, in the Proc. Beng. As. Journ., there are three papers by Sir E. Clive Bayley, K.C.S.I., and one by Mr. Delmerick \"On Rare Coins of Dehli, Malwah, Kalbarga,\" etc., with more than usually good lithographic plates; Mr. Blochmann also comments on coins from the Cabinet of the same gentleman.\u2014In the Journ. Bomb. As. Society are papers by Bhagavanlal Indraji \"On Gadhia Coins of Gujarat,\" and by Dr. Codrington \"On Silver Coins from the Wai.\"\u2014Mr. Thomas publishes in the Indian Antiquary a letter \"On Early Coins of Western India\"; M. Tiesenhausen, in the Bolletino Italiano, a letter on the second volume of \"Fraehn's Opuscula,\" edited by Dr. Dorn; and Mr. Bushell, in the China Review, vol. vi., a short note\n\"On a Rare Manchu Coin,\" with a plate.\u2014In the Journ. of the Germ. Or. Soc. are three papers by Stiebel, \"Numismatisches beim Orientalisten Congress zu St. Petersburg\";\u2014by Noldeke, \"Zu Erkl\u00e4rung d. Sassaniden Manzen\"; and by Karabacek, \"Dynastie d. Danischmande,\" which was treated of by Dr. Mordtmann in a previous number.\u2014The \"International Marsden\" has gone on steadily, and papers have been published in it by Mr. Percy Gardner \"On the Coinage of the Parthians,\" by Mr. Rhys Davids \"On the Ancient Coins of Ceylon,\" and by Mr. E. T. Rogers, \"Coins of the Tuluni Dynasty.\"\u2014In the Numismatic Chronicle is a paper by M. J. P. Six, called \"Observations sur les Monnaies Ph\u00e9niciennes.\"\n\nAs separate works or papers may be mentioned\u2014\n\nLavoix, \"Monnaies \u00e0 Legendes Arabes des Temps des Croisades\";\u2014Vissering, \"On Chinese Currency,\" with a plate;\u2014Holmboe, \"On a Gold Indo-Sassanian Medal,\" and a third volume of the Oriental Coins in the British Museum, including the Turkomana, by Stanley L. Poole, Esq.\n\nIn the Bull. de l'Acad. d. Sciences de St. Petersb., xxiii., M. Dorn prints a paper entitled, \"Sechs und achtzig Silberm\u00fcnzen mit Pelleyew Inschriften,\" and \"Einige bemerkungen zur Sassaniden-M\u00fcnz-kunde.\"\u2014In the Journal also (vol. 24) is a paper by A. H. Mehren, \"Description d'une M\u00e9daille Mongol d'Abou-Said Khan, a.h. 716-32\u2014a.d. 1316-36,\" remarkable for its size, being more than three inches in diameter. It is now preserved in the Imperial Cabinet of St. Petersburg.\u2014M. A. de Markoff has also published \"Les Monnaies des Rois Parthes; Suppl. \u00e0 l'Ouvrage de M. le Comte Prokesch-D'Osten,\" fasc. 2, 4to.; and O. Blau, \"Die Herren von Sophene und deren Munzen\" (Nom. Zeit, ix, 1). The veteran scholar, B. Dorn, has also just published for the \"Collect. Scient. de l'Institut d. Lang. Orientales,\" \"Inventaire d. Mon. d. Khalifes Orientaux et des plusieurs autres Dynasties; Classes I.-IX.\"\nInscriptions Miscellaneous.\u2014The study and interpretation of Inscriptions has been carried on vigorously this last year, especially in Germany, France, and India. Thus, in the Trans. Germ. Or. Soc. vol. xxxi. are able papers by M. A. D. Mordtmann, On engraved stones bearing Pehlevi Legends;\u2014by J. Karabacek, On an Arabic Inscription of the twelfth century from Bosra;\u2014by J. H. Mordtmann, On Himyaritic Inscriptions; and two subsequent papers on the same subject in vol. xxxii.\u2014In the Journal des Savants, M. Renan, also, has paid much attention to this subject. At the Meetings of the Acad. d. Inscriptions, M. Halevy has given \"Notes Compl\u00e9mentaires sur l'Inscription de Byblos\";\u2014M. Renan an account of the remarkable bilingual inscription (Ph\u0153nician and Greek) from Delos,\u2014with a further notice that M. de Ste. Marie has sent, from Africa, the impressions of 200, and M. Guenot of 18, Punic Inscriptions.\u2014In the Journal Asiatique, M. Ganneau has shown that the Ph\u0153nician legend on a stone at Vienna is not, as Dr. Levy of Breslau had thought, genuine.\u2014M. Halevy has also communicated to the Comtes Rendus of the Acad. d. Insc. a careful translation by him of a Jud\u00e6o-Babylonian Inscription on a terra-cotta at the British Museum, the text of which, with a translation in English, was first given by the Rev. Mr. Rodwell in the Trans. Bibl. Arch\u00e6ol. vol. ii. In the Journal Asiatique, also, will be found a notice by M. Antoine D'Abbadie of two \u00c6thiopic Inscriptions found at Axum, containing, if he be right in his interpretation, a record of victories by King Halen, and an elaborate investigation by M. Halevy of the curious graffiti procured some time since at Safa by the Count de Vogu\u00e9. Some account of these has also been given by M. Halevy in the D. M. Ges. vol. xxxii. 1.\u2014M. Berger has studied the meaning of the title \"Tanit Pene Baal,\" so common on the Inscriptions from Carthage; and M. Clermont Ganneau gives a further study of the Inscription from Bozrah, which M. Karabacek had published in the Trans. Germ. Or. Soc.\u2014In the last number of the D. M. Ges. (xxxii. 1) M.\nNoldeke has given a notice \"On a Christian (Syriac) Inscription from Palestine\";\u2014M. Schlottman a paper called, \"Zur Semitisch Epigraphik, Metrum und Reim auf eines \u00c4gyptisch-Aram\u00e4ischen Inschrift\"; and M. Halle, a letter to M. Fleischer on the \"Texte Aram\u00e9en de Carpentras.\"\u2014The second part of M. de Vog\u00fc\u00e9's Inscriptions Semitiques is also announced.\u2014In the Mon. ber. d. Kais. Akad. Wien, March 18, M. Olshausen has contributed a memoir \"\u00dcber das zeitalter einigen inschriften auf Arsacidischen und Sasanidischen Monumenten,\" important for reference to the Greek Inscriptions of Gotarzes at Behistun.\n\nIn the Indian Antiquary are an unusual number of Inscriptions (chiefly if not wholly of Aryan dialects) preserved on stone or copper. Thus Mr. Fleet contributes copies and translations of Nos. xxxiv. v. vi. vii. viii. of his \"Sanskrit and old Canarese Inscriptions,\" of which Nos. xxxv.-vi. comprehend the three remaining Kadamba copper-plate grants;\u2014Dr. B\u00fchler, three new Edicts of Asoka;\u2014eleven land-grants to the Chalukyas of Anuvad, a valuable contribution to the History of Gujarat;\u2014and the Umite Grant of Dadda II., being No. 2 of the Gurjura grants;\u2014and six additional Valabhi grants.\u2014Sir Walter Elliot adds some notes \"On Sanskrit and Canarese Inscriptions\";\u2014Mr. F. S. Growse, a paper \"On Mathura Inscriptions\";\u2014and Mr. Burgess, a notice \"On the Rock-cut Temples of Badami in the Dekhan.\"\n\nIn the Journal of the Bengal Asiatic Society (vol. xlvii. pt. 2) is a notice by Babu Rangalala Banerjea of a \"Copper-plate grant, now in the Record Office of the Cuttack Collectorate;\" with an account by Pratapa Chandra Gosha of three copperplates from Sambulpur:\u2014and, in the Proceedings for March, is a notice by Rajendralala Mitra of a copper-plate grant, sent to him for examination by Mr. E. I. Atkinson of Allahabad; the letters of this Inscription being in the Kutila type, but the language is Sanskrit.\n\nIn the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bombay, vol. xlii,\nare papers by K. Trimbaek Telang, \"On three Kadamba copper-plate Inscriptions\"; by J. F. Fleet, \"On three Copper-plate grants of Kings of Vijayanagara\";\u2014by Bhagavanlal Indraji, \"On ancient Nagari Numerals from an Inscription at Nasaghat\";\u2014\"On the Inscription of a new Andhrabhritya King from Kankari\";\u2014with a \"Revised Facsimile and Translation\" of previous inscriptions;\u2014and, in the Proceedings for May, a notice by Mr. Blochmann of some Persian and Arabic Inscriptions procured by Mr. Delmerick, of Dehli, at H\u00e2ns\u00e2i.\n\nIn the Bolletino Italiano, Sign. Mois\u00e8 Soave has completed and corrected a Hebrew Tomb Inscription at Leon in Spain dated [4]861 A.M. = A.D. 1102. The inscription had been published by Se\u00f1or A. de los Rios in his \"History of the Jews in Spain,\" and translated by Se\u00f1or Garcia Bianco. M. Cherbonneau has noted (Journ. Asiat. ix. 3) a Libyan inscription not unlike the famous one from Thugga (Gesen., Mon. Phoen., now in Brit. Mus.), and General Faidherbe, in ibid. x. 3, has explained two signs not understood by M. Cherbonneau. M. Cherbonneau has also announced that the municipality of Constantine have bought the Punic Inscriptions collected by M. Coste, and have forwarded to Paris impressions of others. An excellent engraving from a photograph of the famous Trilingual Ph\u0153nician Inscription from Sardinia, which was first deciphered by the late E. Deutsch to the Royal Soc. of Literature, has just been published. The study of the Cypriote Inscriptions has not languished. One of the latest papers by Mr. Fox Talbot in the Trans. Bibl. Arch\u00e6ol., v. 2, is devoted to this subject; and papers have been read at meetings of the Bibl. Arch\u00e6ol. Soc. by Mr. Isaac Hall and by Dr. P. Schroeder. To M. Br\u00e9al we owe two papers on Cypriote Inscriptions in the Journ. d. Savants and R\u00e9cue Arch\u00e9ologique respectively; and M. Deecke has also published \"Der Ursprung d. Cyprischen Sylbenschrift, eine Pal\u00e6ographische Untersuchung.\" \u2014 The Pal\u00e6ographical Society has issued a second part, which is not at all inferior to the first they published.\nMr. E. Thomas has suggested that the well-known inscriptions at Doganlu in Phrygia, which have been copied with more or less accuracy by Messrs. Steuart, Hamilton, and Texier, seem to have preserved the names of the founder of the Heraclide Dynasty, at the head of a votive tablet dedicated apparently to EPEKYN or, as Steuart makes it, FPEKYN, together with records on the Tombs of Baba Memes (the Latin form of Meues), of Atye, son of Midas, and of other members of the family. But the most important contribution to the history of the dynasty is the insertion of one, if not more than one, clearly epochal dates. The earliest apparent entry consists of an age-date, viz. the letters \u0393\u0391=33 or 23, according as you use or not the ordinary numeral letters; together with the dynastic date of \u0391\u03a4=301. Now, reckoning these figures by Herodotus's 505 years of the Heraclide rule previously to the usurpation of Gyges in 716 B.C., the Heraclide era must be B.C. 1221, and the date, therefore, outside the chief rock Tomb, will be B.C. 920. There is a second entry on the ornamental compartment at the base of the right column consisting of the letters \u0393\u03b1\u0393 = 373 or 363, but the context is not sufficiently legible to admit of its quotation as a positive record, especially owing to the absence of the dividing dots before the \u0393\u03b1\u0393, or, here again, as Steuart reproduces it, &c\u0393. The language of the Inscriptions is primarily Aryan, being a curious mixture of Greek and Latin, either indicative of a stage prior to the elaboration of their separate grammars, or possibly representing the speech of a border-land between the two families, and the advancing influence of the Greek. The alphabet is likewise in a transition state, consisting of twenty-one letters nearly identical in form with those on the Stele of Mesa of Moab (B.C. 896), with the single addition of the indispensable Aryan Y.\n\nAfrica.\u2014The importance of Africa, from a scientific point of view, has been yearly increasing, and, as there is no special\nsociety in England devoted to that great continent, it seems but a fair extension of the sphere of this Society to embrace these new interests. The Chapter on the Languages of Africa, from the pen of Mr. A. H. Hearne, is a most valuable one. Through the kind assistance of our late President, Sir Bartle Frere, now Governor of the Cape, Miss Lloyd, the sister-in-law of the late Dr. Bleek, has been collecting volumes on the languages of South Africa, to be forwarded to this Society, and if copies of the numerous volumes published from time to time by the Church Missionary Society could be obtained, we should have a good beginning to a collection which promises to be extended indefinitely, as Dr. Hoelle's Polyglotta Africana, which obtained the Volney Prize, comprises one hundred well-marked languages. The following works and papers may be mentioned as bearing upon this subject: F. M\u00fcller, Die Sprachen Bassa, Grebor und Kru in Westlichen Afrika (S. ber. Kais. Akad. Wien, lxxxvi.);\u2014Adler, N., Ueber die Kaffirn und deren jetzige stellung zu den Sud-Afrikanischen Colonien (Mon. f. d. Orient. Wien);\u2014F. von Osterreicher, Das Som\u00e1li-land (Mon. f. d. Orient. Jan. 1878).\n\nOriental Congress of 1878.\u2014The Fourth Oriental Congress is to assemble this year on Sept. 12-18 at Florence, under the presidency of M. Amari. Mr. John Muir, Professor W. Wright, and Prof. A. H. Sayce, will represent Edinburgh, Cambridge, and Oxford, respectively; and Messrs. Chenery and Brandreth this Society. As stated in last year's Report, a prize of 5000 lire has been offered by the Minister of Public Instruction, \"al miglior lavoro sulle vicende delle Civilt\u00e0 Aria nell' India.\"\n\nAt the conclusion of the Report, Sir Edward Colebrooke (the President) said\u2014\"I have to offer you my congratulations on the evidence afforded by this Report of the continued\ninterest taken in Oriental studies, and of the active work done by societies affiliated to our own or by kindred societies throughout Europe and the East. I may also congratulate you on the state of our finances. It is a small matter, perhaps, to speak of, but as money is 'the sinews of war,' so is it the support of any society such as our own. This improvement of our finances is an outward and visible sign of what we are doing and still hope to do, and an earnest of the progress that awaits us in the future. We have a considerable increase of members, representing also a considerable increase of revenue, and thus it is that our balance compares favourably with that of the preceding year. Our finances have been considerably improved by the activity of our Secretary in calling up arrears, and in having secured much more steady payments on the part of members. Encouraged by this accession of funds and by the increase in the number of papers offered for publication, the Council have come to the resolution which has been announced to you to-day, to bring out our Journal at stated intervals\u2014three Parts appearing in each year. For many years past we have been under great disadvantages in that our Journal came out very slowly and very irregularly. Looking to the past, I find that we have never counted on more than two volumes in every three years. That was the rate of publication at first, and the twenty volumes of the first Series represent the work of thirty years; while during the last two or three years, the progress has been in the same proportion. We may hope, however, for an improvement. The papers that have come in lead us to hope so. With that promise, and the means that we have at our disposal, we hope to be able to fulfil this engagement. This, I trust, may afford matter for future congratulation, for there can hardly be a doubt that the irregularity with which the Journal has lately appeared has discouraged many persons from giving papers to our Society; and they have offered their contributions to other societies on whom they could rely for more punctual publication.\n\"With this promise of support from those who take an interest in Oriental studies, and from those who, from their past career, feel a deep concern in the progress of India, we are warranted in the belief that it is only necessary to make an appeal to them to cause them to come forward and give us that support and assistance which we may justly expect. We owe this improvement of our position to the exertions of our Council, and especially to the untiring energy of our Secretary. If we can secure regularity in the publication of our Journal, this, of itself, will, in all probability, bring us larger literary contributions, and better pecuniary support, and the Society may be enabled to resume something of the pristine energy and renown it enjoyed when its labours embraced the literature and antiquities of Asia. If we fail in this respect, I may say that it will not be owing to any want of interest on the part of the public in all questions on which we profess to take an active concern, for, as I have stated on former occasions, we see that Indian literature is acquiring in the present day a popularity it never before enjoyed. By popularity I do not mean that it will gain the support of the millions, but that there is an increasing interest on the part of all well-educated and well-informed men, in the literature, the antiquities, and the social life of the East. These are matters of abiding interest; and there is evidence that it will not be allowed to flag, in the desire of eminent men to encourage it by the publication of works that will satisfy the tastes and wants of the public. I think that, in this career, we have a wide field open to us, and trust that this country will never fail in the work that belongs specially to us, to labour in common with the rest of the world in illustrating the literature, the antiquities, the sciences, and the arts of the East. I have said this much of the state and prospects of our Society, and I have now\u2014I will not say a more pleasing, but\u2014a different duty to discharge. This is the third time in which, owing to the\nindulgence of the Society, I have occupied the honourable position in which you have placed me. I have felt, throughout, my own deficiency in filling the position adequately, partly owing to other and public duties, but still more to the want of scholarship which you must look for, and expect, in one who occupies such an office. I have, however, derived much support from the assistance of the Council, numbering among them gentlemen of the greatest learning\u2014who take a deep interest in the East; and, above all, I have had the assistance of your able Secretary. Emboldened by this, I have undertaken the duties of this office; and it is with the utmost satisfaction that I now hand it over to a gentleman of distinguished abilities, and who has taken the deepest interest in Oriental research. I have no doubt of the career of activity and usefulness which is before him. I will only say for myself, in conclusion, that I shall continue to feel the same interest in the prosperity and progress of the Society, as an humble member thereof, that I have felt since you did me the honour of placing me in the chair.\"\n\nProfessor Monier Williams then moved the formal adoption of the Report, adding\u2014\"Although we have not heard the whole of the Report, I may be allowed, in common with other Oriental scholars, to express my grief for the personal losses we have sustained during the past year. Permit me also to say that I have been much interested in the Archaeological part of the Report read by the Secretary; I must also thank our President for his speech, which I have heard with the greatest interest. We are all under great obligations to him for his attention to the interests of our Society; and I have to express my sorrow, in which I am sure you all participate, that he is about to retire. Our sorrow is tempered by satisfaction on hearing that he is to have so able and well-tried a successor. If you wish me to tell you about the progress of Oriental studies at Oxford, I am sorry to say I\ncannot give you a very cheerful view of the present situation of affairs. Of course most of us were examined before the Oxford Commissioners. I was examined among the number, and pleaded as earnestly as I could in favour of the Oriental requirements of the University. I argued that the increasing tendency to govern India from the Houses of Parliament, whose members are often educated at Oxford, made it incumbent on us to do more than we had hitherto done for Eastern studies.\" Professor Williams then entered into a statement of the position of Eastern studies at Oxford enumerating the suggestions he made to the Commission for the better cultivation of those studies. Professor Williams sought, first, formal university recognition; secondly, an increase of staff; thirdly, encouragement of learners; and, lastly, centralization by the founding of an Indian Institute. He urged the establishment of a school of Indian studies in which degrees could be obtained and honours also. At present such studies were under a ban at Oxford. How, he asked, were Oriental requirements dealt with in the long statement issued by the Oxford Commissioners? He was very sorry to say that they were\u2014if not quite ignored\u2014certainly slighted in a manner that, instead of cooling his ardour for India, almost made his Indian blood boil. The manner in which Indian subjects had been dealt with roused his wrath, as it ought to rouse the wrath of all Orientalists. Any one who waded through that lengthy document would find that the only allusion to Oriental requirements was a suggestion that the two existing Arabic Chairs should be amalgamated into one, and that one Chair for both Persian and Zend should be founded. Both these chairs were to be classed under the second order of professorships, in which the stipends were not to exceed 500l. per annum\u2014a sum not calculated to attract first-class men. Not one word was contained in the statement bearing on the cultivation of Indian literature; and this was a specimen\nof the interest a number of picked Englishmen felt in the furtherance of Oriental learning! He hoped every one present was prepared to protest against such a slight. He trusted that the Royal Asiatic Society would co-operate in protesting against it. If it were asked what was Oxford herself doing to satisfy the needs of Orientalists, he could only reply by reading the resolutions passed by the committee appointed to consider the question. These resolutions were to the effect that a school of Indian studies should be founded; that the three classical languages of India should be substituted for Greek and Latin during the whole of a student's course; and that Indian Civil Service probationers should be allowed to take their degrees after two years' residence.\n\nA long discussion took place in the Oxford Council, and the resolutions were rejected. It was held that the scheme was not large enough\u2014not comprehensive enough\u2014for a great University, so the whole matter was referred back to a committee. However, notwithstanding these delays and discouragements, and in spite of all the difficulties which had been placed in the way, he did not despair, nor did he feel disheartened. Every man had to fight his way through all sorts of obstacles if he wished to do any good work; and he was ready to go on fighting as long as strength and health remained, until victory was achieved. In conclusion, he would say that the sum of \u00a35,000 had been promised him, and the India Office had made him a large grant of books for the proposed Oxford Indian Institute, and had promised contributions towards the Museum. He intended, as soon as possible, to have collections established in temporary rooms, so as to form the nucleus of an Indian Library and Museum.\n\nMr. E. B. Eastwick, in seconding the motion, said he felt there was no one in the room so unfit as he to make any proposition with regard to the Report. He had been compelled to be absent in India during the greater part of the year, and had not therefore been able to follow the\nproceedings of the Society, or to know the advances they had made. With regard to the Archaeological portion of it, alluded to by Professor Williams, he would found this remark upon it, viz. the fact that there was no Archaeological Inspector for the Madras Presidency. He considered it was a great mistake on the part of the Government to have no such officer. Dr. Burnell had been mentioned as a proper person for such a post, and it was only justice to one of the greatest living Oriental scholars to acknowledge his thorough fitness for it. He (Mr. Eastwick) had seen the first portion of the catalogue of the Tanjore MSS. made by Dr. Burnell, amounting to nearly 12,000; which alone might well be considered the work of an entire lifetime, yet was only one of many things Dr. Burnell had on hand. His judgeship at Tanjore was very laborious work; and, although for years a very early riser, he was still unable to get through half he purposed to do. With regard to the Indians themselves and the progress they had made, he would mention that he stayed some days at the house of a Brahmin, who, with his wife, lived like Europeans. But a stronger proof still lay in the fact that an Indian gentleman intended coming to England to seek the suffrages of one of the English constituencies. Mr. Eastwick concluded by expressing a hope that the Royal Asiatic Society would press upon the Government the expediency of appointing an Archaeological Inspector for Madras.\n\nMajor-General Sir H. C. Rawlinson, K.C.B., F.R.S. (President-elect), said\u2014\"It is with some diffidence I have accepted the high office which the Society have done me the honour of conferring upon me. I say it is with diffidence, because, in the first place, I am not as active in mind or body as I was some years ago, while, with increasing years, comes, also, an indisposition to work. But at the same time I have a great interest in the success of the Society, with which I have been connected for the last forty years. In 1837-8, I first came into connection with it, and ever since that time I have felt a\ndeep interest in its prosperity. When the Council pressed upon me their desire that I should take office again, I could not resist the appeal. I feel, naturally, great diffidence in taking office, not only on account of my own shortcomings, but more especially in having to succeed such a President as Sir Edward Colebrooke, who has, during the period of his administration, showed such devoted care to the interests of the Society. Coming after him I must needs feel under considerable embarrassment. There is another impediment also to my efficiency as President, that, during the summer, I reside out of London, and must thus come up to town for every meeting of the Society. However, I am only too happy to place my services, such as they are, at the disposal of the Society. And I may add, that I enter upon office also with certain advantages\u2014namely, an increased number of members, enlarged revenues, and a highly-efficient Council. I think I may say that we are showing increased signs of power and usefulness in the quality of the papers that have been submitted to us. The last number of the Journal is certainly as good as ever it was in bye-gone years. For some time there appeared to be a falling off in the quality of the papers; but, if we can depend upon a succession of papers of the same character and scholarship as those contained in the last number of the Journal, we are entering upon a second career of high reputation and Oriental usefulness. No doubt there is a large amount of Oriental knowledge, experience, and fitness in our Council and members; and if we only put our shoulders to the wheel and work in common, we shall rival the old days when Mr. H. T. Colebrooke led the Society to the pinnacle of fame. We were then the leading Oriental Society in Europe\u2014in the world,\u2014and it is quite within our means to reach that highly-distinguished position again. Having placed my services, then, at the disposal of the Society, and taking heart from the success of my predecessor, I will only add that I shall endeavour to emulate\nhim in the care and attention he has bestowed on the Society's affairs during his period of office.\"\n\nSir Edward Colebrooke then announced the following Members to serve as the Council and Officers of the ensuing year 1878-9.\n\nPresident and Director.\u2014Major-General Sir H.
