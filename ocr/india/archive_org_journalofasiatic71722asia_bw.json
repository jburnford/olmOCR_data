For instance, Linn\u00e6us and Fabricius described many species from \"China,\" many of these and a few others were figured by Drury, Cramer, Herbst and Donovan at the end of the eighteenth century. In 1861 Wallengren described two new species and mentioned a third obtained during the voyage of the frigate \"Fug\u00e9nie\" which touched at Hongkong; in 1862 Felder described four species and mentioned a fifth captured by the officers of the frigate \"Novara\" which visited the island; in 1886 R\u00f6ber described two new species of Lycaenid\u00e6 from Hongkong; while in 1899 Kirby recorded five species from thence. The first list of the butterflies known to occur in Hongkong was compiled by Messrs. Sydney B. J. Skertchly and James J. Walker, and is published in a little book entitled \"Our Island. A Naturalist's Description of Hongkong\" by Mr. Sydney B. J. Skertchly, F.G.S., M.A.I. (1893). This list embraces 116 species. Of these I have omitted from the present list Ideopsis daos, Boisduval, Amathusia phidippus, Doubleday, and Pandita\nsp., all of which are species found in the Malay Peninsula and are not likely to occur in Hongkong. But a much more important list is that by Mr. James J. Walker, R.N., F.L.S., entitled \"A Preliminary List of the Butterflies of Hongkong; based on Observations and Captures made during the Winter and Spring months of 1892 and 1893,\" published in the Transactions of the Entomological Society of London for 1895, pp. 433-477. In this list 125 species are noted. In the present list I have omitted Ideopsis daos and Amathusia phidippus for the reason noted above. Moreover, Mr. Walker records what I consider to be five species under two names each, these being 8. Euploea (Isamia) superba, Herbst, and 9. Euploea (Trepsichrois) midamus, Linnaeus. 16. Ypthima h\u00fcbneri, Kirby, and 17. Ypthima argus, Butler. 78. Catopsilia catilla, Cramer, and 79. Catopsilia crocale, Cramer. 80. Terias hecate, Linnaeus, and 81. Terias mandarina, de l'Orza. 85. Pieris (Huphina) nereisa, Fabricius, and 86. Pieris (Huphina) pallida, Swinhoe. This reduces Walker's list to 118 species. In the present list 140 species are given, of which 22 marked with an asterisk (*) have not been seen by me. The gain in number of species observed in Hongkong in the six years since Walker wrote is therefore twenty-two. Walker also mentions a specimen of Hestia lynceus, Drury, which he had seen \"taken more than twenty years ago on the wharf at Kowloon\u2014an obvious importation.\" This species is omitted from his list and also the present one.\n\nMy friend, Mr. E. F. Skertchly, son of Mr. Sydney B. J. Skertchly in collaboration with Mr. Kershaw, proposes to bring out an elaborate work illustrated with coloured plates on the Rhopalocera of Hongkong. A specimen of these plates I have seen chromo-lithographed in Japan, and it is an excellent production. To help in the good work of publishing this volume I have written this paper, as entomological books are scarce in Hongkong, and my assistance has been asked as regards identification of the various species and the necessary synonymy. My share of this work appears in the list below; the particulars given of the food-plants of the same are closely-allied species occurring in India and elsewhere is a help to the discovery of the transformations of the various species of butterflies in Hongkong itself. A knowledge of the food-plant of any particular butterfly is more than half the battle in discovering its larva. I may note that Messrs. Skertchly and Kershaw have for the last few years sent me consignments from time to time of Hongkong butterflies for identification; moreover, I have a superficial knowledge of them from having twice visited the colony for short periods. The butterflies of Hongkong are on the whole remarkably similar to those of India, not a single genus being found in the\nisland or on the adjoining mainland, which does not occur in India, while about ninety per cent. of the species are identical or extremely closely allied, the \"local variation\" being remarkably slight. This is perhaps not so much to be wondered at, as there is continuous land connection between India and Hongkong save the narrow strait about a mile wide which separates Kowloon or the mainland from the island. Moreover, Hongkong is on the same parallel of latitude as Calcutta, and has a very similar climate, though it is on the whole slightly cooler. The most interesting butterfly mentioned is, I think, Danais (Anosia) erippus menippe, H\u00fcbner, the well-known \"Wanderer,\" a pair of which was taken in Hongkong in August last. This butterfly continues to extend its range, but has not as far as I know been yet obtained on the mainland of Asia, though it has spread from its original home in North America to Europe on the east, and right round through the Pacific Islands, Australia, and the Malayan Archipelago to the Straits of Malacca.*\n\nFamily NYMPHALID\u00c6.\n\nSub-family DANAIN\u00c6.\n\n1.

Ind., vol. i, p. 44 (1890).\n\nDr. F. Moore in 1893 recorded L. chrysippus from South China, but described L. bowringi as a new species from Hongkong, which also is in South China. In 1890, he says that it is \"doubtfully of racial value.\" The larva of Limnas has three pairs of fleshy filaments; in Hongkong it has been reported to feed on Asclepias curassavica, Linn., and in India it feeds on plants of the Natural Order Asclepiad\u00e6, such as Calotropis and Asclepias.\n\n6. Danais (Salatura) plexippus, Linnaeus.\n\nPapilio plexippus, Linnaeus, Syst. Nat. Ins., ed. x, vol. i, pt. 2, p. 471, n. 80 (1758); Papilio genutia, Cramer, Pap. Ex., vol. iii, p. 23, pl. ccvi, figs.

Lond., 1895, p. 445, n. 6.\n\nThe larva of Salatura has three pairs of fleshy filaments, and in India feeds on plants of the Natural Order Asclepiad\u00e6, such as Cynanchum, Ceropoea and Pussularia, in Ceylon on Raphis, Ceropoea and Raphanus.\n\n7. * Danais (Parantica) melanoides, Moore.\n\nParantica melanoides, Moore, Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1883, p. 847, n. 1; Danais (Parantica) melanoides, Walker, Trans. Ent. Soc. Lond., 1895, p. 445, n. 4.\nThe larva of *Parantica* has two pairs only of fleshy filaments. The larva has never been discovered, but that of the allied species, *P. aglea*, Cramer, has been recorded to feed on plants of the natural order *Asclepiadex*, such as *Cryptolepis*, *Calotropis*, *Tylophora*, in South India and Ceylon.\n\n8. **Danais (Caduga) sita**, Kollar.\n\n*Danais sita*, Kollar, Hugel's Kaschmir, vol. iv, pt. 5, p. 424, n. 1, pl. vi, figs. 1, 2, male (1844); *Danais (Caduga) sita* Mackinnon and de Nic\u00e9ville, Journ.

Lond., 1895, p. 444, n. 2.\n\nThe larva of *Caduga* has two pairs only of fleshy filaments, and feeds in India on *Marsdenia*, natural order *Asclepiadex*. Hongkong specimens of *D. sita* agree absolutely with Indian ones.\n\n9. **Eupl\u0153a (Crastia) godartii**, Lucas.\n\n*Eupl\u0153a godartii*, Lucas, Rev. et Mag.

Major (now Colonel) C. H. E. Adamson, c.i.e., in \"Notes on the Danain\u00e6 of Burmah,\" p. 12 (1889), records that he has \"bred *E. godartii* from caterpillars found feeding on orange trees,\" *Citrus* sp., natural order *Rutace\u00e6*. More probable plants would, I think, be species of *Holarrhena*, *Nerium* and *Ichnocarpus* of the natural order *Apocynace\u00e6*, or *Streblus* and *Ficus* of the *Urticace\u00e6*.\n\n10. **Eupl\u0153a (Crastia) kinbergi**, Wallengren.\n\n*Eupl\u0153a kinbergi*, Wallengren, Wien, Ent.

Ind., vol. i, p. 87, pl. xxviii, figs. 1, 1a, male (1890).\n\nThis very variable and common butterfly is restricted to Southern China, and has been bred on *Strophanthus divergens*, Grah.\u2014natural order *Apocynace\u00e6*. The larva will probably be found to feed on *Nerium*, natural order *Apocynace\u00e6*, or on *Ficus*, natural order *Urticace\u00e6*.\n11. **Euploea (Isamia) midamus**, Linn\u00e6us.\n\n*Papilio midamus*, Linn\u00e6us, Syst.

Herbst calls his fig. 3 on pl. cxix a \u2642, while it is a \u2640, and his figs. 1 and 2 on pl. cxx a \u2640, while it is a \u2642. Dr. F. Moore sets this right in Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1883, page 311, n. 3, as regards the \u2640; but on page 313, n. 6, erroneously calls figs. 1 and 2 \u2640 instead of \u2642. He also uses *superba* instead of *superbus* as originally written, and refers to plate 102 instead of plate 122. He makes two species out of Herbst\u2019s figures, while they represent one species only.\n\nDr. F. Moore in 1883 and again in 1891 records and keeps distinct four species of *Isamia* from South China. These four species are in my opinion one and the same species, which at Hongkong, and doubtless wherever it occurs in Southern China, is a most variable one. In Hongkong the larva has been reported to feed on *Strophanthus divergens*, Grah., Natural Order *Apocynace\u00e6*.\n\n**Subfamily SATYRIN\u00c6.**\n\n12. **Mycalesis (Calysisme) mineus**, Linn\u00e6us.\n\n*Papilio mineus* Linn\u00e6us, Syst.

Lond., 1895, p. 447, n. 13; *Mycalesis mineus*, var. *confucius*, Leech, Butt. China, Japan and Corea, p. 12, pl. ii, fig. 7, male (1892); Kirby, The Entomologist, vol. xxxii, p. 31 (1899).\n\nThe var. *confucius* is the dry-season form of *M. mineus* found in China. The larva in India feeds on grasses.\n\n13. **Mycalesis (Calysisme) horsfieldii**, Moore.\n\n*Calysisme horsfieldii*, Moore, Lep. Ind., vol., i, p. 197, pl. lxvi, figs. 2, 2a, 2b,\nmale, wet-season form; 2c, male, dry-season form (1892);? Mycalesis perseus, Wallace (nec Fabricius), Trans. Ent. Soc. Lond., 1895, p. 447, n. 12.\n\nOnly two species of Mycalesis have hitherto been found in Hongkong. Walker gives mineus and perseus. The latter is stated by Dr. F. Moore in Lep. Ind., vol. i, pp. 177, 178, to have a very wide range, being found almost throughout India, Ceylon, Burma, the Malay Peninsula and many of the islands of the Malay Archipelago, and in Hainan and Formosa. It may, as Walker states, be found in Hongkong, but it is more probable, I think, that what he identified as M. perseus is the comparatively common M. horsfieldii, which has been described since Mr. Walker wrote his paper. It has never been bred, but its larva will almost certainly be found on grasses.\n\n14. LETHE EUROPA, Fabricius.\n\nPapilio europa, Fabricius, Syst.

Lond., 1895, p. 448, n. 15; Lethe rohria, Kirby (nec Fabricius), The Entomologist, vol. xxxii, p. 31 (1899).\n\nMr. James J. Walker records Lethe verma, Kollar, from a single specimen taken in the Happy Valley, Hongkong, in March. This is, I think, probably an incorrect identification, the present species being meant. L. verma is a common species in the hills of Northern India, and is found in the hills of Western China, but not I believe in Western China. As the name implies, there has been much confusion regarding this species. Until recently it has been always known as L. rohria Fabricius, until Dr. Aurivillius pointed out that the true rohria is an older name for the Lethe dyrta of Felder. The larva will almost certainly be found to feed on the leaves of bamboo.\n\n16. YPTHIMA AVANTA, Moore.\n\nYpthima avanta, Moore, Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond., 1874, p. 567; Elwes and Edwards, Trans. Ent.

I have ventured to put Walker's two species *h\u00fcbneri* [recte *huebneri*] and *argus* under *avanta*, as I do not believe that either of them are found in Hongkong, and that they have been wrongly identified. *T. avanta* is found in the Western Himalayas, in the plains of the North-Western Provinces, at Ranchi and Bholahat in Maldah, both in the plains of Bengal, in the Eastern Himalayas, in the Ganjam district of Eastern India, throughout Burma, and on the West River in Southern China. It has not been bred, but the larva will be found on grasses.\n\n17. **Melanitis ismene**, Cramer.\n\n*Papilio ismene*, Cramer, Pap. Ex., vol. i, p. 40, pl. xxvi, figs.

I have not seen it from thence, but do not doubt the correctness of the record. It occurs in Western China, and as far westwards again as Kashmir.

The larva will almost certainly be found to feed on Bambusa sp., Natural Order Gramineae.\n\nIt is remarkable that no species of the subfamily Elymiin\u00e6 has been recorded from Hongkong. As the importation of ornamental palms on which the larvae feed is probably considerable from countries where species of the group are common, it is more than probable that species of Elymiin\u00e6 will become naturalised in the island and on the adjoining mainland.\n\nSubfamily NYMPHALIN\u00c6.\n\n21.* Charaxes (Eulepis) athamas, Drury.\n\nPapilio Eques achivus athamas, Drury, Ill.

II. 2\nMy material from Hongkong can superficially be broken up into two distinct groups, one with pale tawny bands on the upper side of both wings, of which I have four males and one female, the males are dated 17th and 26th April, and 5th December, while one has no date; the female also bears no date: the other with white bands, of which I have two pairs, one male is dated 14th July, the other is undated; one female is dated 21st July, the other bears no date. *P. polyxena* was originally described from China, and my single tawny banded example of that sex agrees very well with Cramer's figure, but that the \"tail\" to the binding from the third median nervule is much longer (in Cramer's specimen it was probably broken off), and the dark and light markings of both wings on the underside are more strongly contrasted in Cramer's figure than in my specimen. The tawny banded males are extremely constant, and differ but little from my female; the \"tail\" to the hindwing is of course much shorter, and the submarginal series of black spots on the upperside of that wing instead of being each centred with a white spot has the anteriormost spot in one instance and the two anteriormost spots in three instances so marked. Of the white banded group in one male the band consists of four portions divided by the veins, the anterior the smallest, the posterior the largest, with a minute white spot anterior to the first of these with no spots beyond it whatever; in my other male the band consists of eight spots, there being two (instead of one as in the first-described specimen) in the upper discoidal interspace, and another in the subcortical interspace, as well as the one on the sutural area. The markings of the hindwing on the upperside also differ in my two male specimens, in the first described of these the discal band is fulvous, in the latter it is anteriorly white. My two white banded females also differ the one from the other, and neither of them agree with Donovan's figure, as that figure shows no discal band on the upperside of the hindwing, while in my specimens this band is prominent. In my two examples one has on the upperside of the forewing three fulvous-white spots anterior to the third median nervule, which are absent in the other. My specimens agree fairly well with Dr. Moore's description of that sex under the name of *H. bernardus*. Mr. J. O. Westwood remarked on Donovan's figures that \"This uncommonly rare Chinese butterfly has not been figured in any other work. Fabricius described it only from the drawings of Jones. I possess a specimen in which the central\nfascia is nearly white, and is continued half way across the posterior wings, and the black spots in the latter are very broad and confluent, without white in the centre.\" Dr. Moore separated *H. bernardus* from *H. polyxena*, and noted that \"This species [*bernardus*] is distinct from *H. polyxena*, Cramer, and is allied to the Indian *H. jalinder*, Butler, and *H. hippanax*, Felder.\" Fabricius described the medial band across the forewing on the upperside in *P. bernardus* as \"flava,\" which is yellow, while Dr. Moore calls it \"bluish-white.\" Donovan's figure of *P. bernardus* shows this band white just tinged with yellow. Fabricius' description of *P. bernardus* evidently applies to Cramer's figure of *P. polyxena*. In describing the male of *H. bernardus* Dr. Moore says that the white band on the upperside of the forewing ends \"At the lower [first] median veinlet.\" This is probably a slip for submedian nervure. Messrs. Rothschild and Jordon give seven local races of *Charaxes polyxena*, of which the Chinese form \"*G. polyxena polyxena*\" is the last. They consider the white and yellow banded forms to be one and the same species, the species being dichromatic. It has never been bred.\n\n23. **Apatura (Rohana) parysatis**, Westwood.\n\n*Apatura parisatis*, Westwood, Gen. Diurn. Lep., vol. ii, p. 305, n. 20, note (1850); *A. parisatis*, Standinger, Ex.

Lond., 1895, p. 452, n. 29; *Diadema*\nMr. Leech has himself sunk *H. viridis* to the rank of a variety of *H. mena*. From his figure of it (l.c., fig. 3) the underside of the hindwing has \"the costa above the costal nervure and the abdominal fold yellow.\" Mr. Leech notes, however, that male specimens of var. *viridis* received subsequent to the description of the species have none of this yellow coloration. I am a little doubtful if this character is not sufficient to separate *H. viridis*, Leech, and *H. nicevillei*, Moore, from *P. assimilis*, Linn\u00e6us, and *P. mena*, Moore. *H. mena* was originally described from \"North India,\" in 1895 Mr. Walker recorded it from Hongkong, but Dr. Moore in 1896 said the habitat is unknown. I have seen but a single pair from Hongkong, the female of which agrees very closely with Dr. Moore's figure of that sex (not a male as stated). I would draw especial attention to a series of four or five submarginal pink spots on both surfaces of the hindwing which are visible in my specimens, in Messrs. Grose-Smith and Kirby's figures and in Mr. Leech's figure No. 4 of var. *nigrivena*. These spots occupy the same position exactly as the crimson spots in *P. assimilis*, which has led me to suspect that *P. mena* is not improbably a dimorphic form of that species. The genus *Parhestina* is evidently in a very plastic state, and it appears to me that the process of mimicry to species of *Dana\u00efs* is now actively going on. Typical *P. assimilis* with its brilliant crimson spots is a conspicuous species, and it is evident that it would be advantageous to it to become less gaudily coloured and to be able to pass itself off as a nauseous *Dana\u00efs*. Mr. James J. Walker records the breeding of a specimen in Hongkong, but does not mention the food-plant of the larva, which still remains unknown.\n\n26. **Euthalia phemius**, Doubleday and Hewitson.\n\n*Adolias phemius*, Doubleday and Hewitson, Gen.

Walker having taken a pair coupled of this butterfly in Hongkong finally settles the question as to the opposite sexes of the\ninsect. He also obtained a pupa attached to a twig under some litchi trees (Nephelium Lit-chi, Camb., Natural Order Sapindaceae), but that cannot be the food-plant of the larva in India, as it grows wild nowhere in this country, while the butterfly is common in the Eastern Himalayas, Assam, Upper Burma, and Indo-China. Its food-plant still remains unknown.\n\n27. **Limenitis** (Ladaga) **camilla**, Linn\u00e6us.\n\n*Papilio camilla*, Linn\u00e6us, Mus.

Ind. Linn\u00e6us\u2019 Syst. Nat. Ins., tenth edition, is not available, so I am\nunable to check the first entry; though apparently the name given therein on p. 486, n. 173, is *hylas* and not *eurynome*. If this be so, *eurynome* cannot be ascribed to Linnaeus, but should be credited to Westwood, as was done by Dr. Moore in 1874. Donovan's fig. 4 of pl. xxxv applies to this insect: he called it *leucotho\u00eb*, mistaking the insect for the *Athyma leucotho\u00eb* described by Linnaeus as *Papilio leucotho\u00eb*, which itself is a synonym of the older *Papilio [Athyma] perius*, Linnaeus. As there is an older *Neptis* named *leucotho\u00eb* of Cramer the species under consideration cannot be called *Neptis leucotho\u00eb*, Donovan. Mr. Kirby records *Neptis hainana*, Moore, originally described from Hainan Island, China, from Hongkong, but Dr. Moore considers that species to be distinct from the Hongkong one, so as I have no Hainan specimens I have followed him in this. This group of the genus occurs almost everywhere in the East, and in my opinion has received far too many names. Wherever the seasons are markedly wet and dry, seasonal dimorphism is very strongly marked, particularly so in Hongkong. The insect in Hongkong has not been bred, but the transformations of its Indian allies are well known, *N. varmana*, Moore, in South India being found in the larval state on peas of various kinds, Natural Order *Leguminosae*.\n\n35.* **Precis atlites**, Linnaeus.\n\n*Papilio atlites*, Linnaeus, Cent.

Mr. Fruhstorfer doubts Cramer's locality and records Z. \"phlegyas\" from East and West Java only. He names the North Indian form Z. phlegyas indicus, but Indian specimens are identical with those from China. Mr. Kirby records Z. confucius, Moore, from Hongkong, a species originally described from the Island of Hainan off the coast of China.

Duthie, B.A., F.L.S., Director, Botanical Department, North India.\n\n[Received 25th November, 1901. Read 4th December, 1901.]\n\nSince the publication in 1898 of the four volumes on the Sikkim orchids by Sir George King and Mr. R. Pantling, I have been engaged during my spare time in the preparation of a similar work on the orchids of North-West and Central India. As, owing to more pressing work, there may be some delay in its completion, I have decided to publish at once the descriptions of some new species, which have been discovered within the period during which I have been able to make a special study of the subject.\n\nFor the greater portion of the material, on which the following descriptions are based I am indebted to my friend, Mr. P. W. Mackinnon, who for many years has taken a keen interest in the botany, and especially the orchids, of the Mussoorie district. Also, by his having carefully trained some intelligent hillmen in his service to work as collectors, some very interesting results have been obtained. I wish to express also my appreciation of Sir William Thiselton-Dyer's kindness in allowing me to consult Mr. R. A. Rolfe, the eminent orchidologist at the Royal Herbarium at Kew, from whom I have received great assistance.\n\n1. Microstylis Mackinnoni Duthie, n. sp.\n\nWhole plant 1-1\u00b77 dm. high. Stem 3-4 cm., swollen below and rising from the base of the previous year's pseudo-bulb; lower portion enclosed within the leaf-sheaths. Leaves 2 or 3, horizontal, unequal in size, the larger one about 6 cm. long and 4 cm. broad, ovate, obtuse, 3-7-nerved, cordate and amplexicaul at the base, fleshy; upper surface dark brownish-green; main nerves 3-7, prominent beneath and purple-coloured, the interspaces raised above, and giving the whole leaf a bullate appearance. Scape reddish-purple, sharply 4-angular. Raceme shorter than the scape; bracts subulate, persistent, reflexed, longer than the ovary. Flowers sessile, very small, reddish-purple, resupinate. Dorsal sepal ovate-lanceolate, subacute; lateral shorter, subfalcate, edges of all reflexed. Petals linear, shorter than the sepals, much reflexed. Basal and apical portions of lip divided by a raised rim, basal lobes falcately ovate-lanceolate, contiguous, or overlapping at the tips; apical portion of lip deeply bifid and protruded, deep crimson-purple. Column with fleshy rounded arms. Anther with a truncate or emarginate lip. Ovary clavate, curved, not twisted.\nWestern Him\u0101laya, near Mussoorie, on the southern face of the Park Hill, up to 6,000 feet, P. W. Mackinnon; also on the Kalanga Hill in Dehra Dun, 2-3,000 feet, Mackinnon's collector.\n\nAlthough most nearly related to M. Wallichii, the very different leaves at once distinguish this plant from any of the many forms of that species. It has also much smaller flowers and a very differently shaped lip.\n\n2. Oreorchis Rolfei Duthie, n. sp.\n\nPseudo-bulb globose. Leaves two or three, about 2 dm. long by 1 to 1\u00b75 cm. broad, deflexed at the tips. 3-5-nerved, plicate. Scape about as long as the leaves, rising from near the top of the pseudo-bulb. Peduncle firm, with 3 or 4 close-fitting tubular sheaths. Raceme many-flowered, about 6\u00b77 cm. long. Flowers sessile, rather crowded, about 1\u00b74 cm. across. Floral bract minute, less than half the length of the ovary. Sepals about equal, 1\u00b74 cm. long, lanceolate, subacute, pale yellowish-green, slightly spreading. Petals as long as the sepals, but narrower, oblanceolate, subacute, pure white with a few purple blotches. Lip obovate-oblong (when spread out), narrowed at the base into a short sac-like claw, side-lobes linear, fleshy, white, half the length of the mid-lobe; mid-lobe deflexed, white, and like the petals blotched with purple, apex with a shallow sinus, base of disc with a prominent fleshy oval channelled callus. Column curved, dilated at the base, concave in front. Pollinia globular, united to a short thick conical caudicle.\n\nWestern Him\u0101laya, on N\u0101g T\u012bba in Tehri-Garhwal, at an elevation of about 8,000 feet. Mackinnon's collector. Flowers in June.\n\nThis species is most nearly allied to O. micrantha, but the spike is shorter and the flowers are more crowded; it differs also by having a saccate base to the lip, and both the lip and petals are pure white spotted with purple. The callus at the base of the lip is oval and not linear. I have much pleasure in naming this orchid after Mr. R. A. Rolfe, of the Royal Herbarium at Kew.\n\n3. Cirrhopetalum Hookeri Duthie, n. sp.\n\nCespitose. Pseudo-bulbs crowded, ovoid or nearly round, 1\u00b75-1\u00b77 cm. long. Leaves solitary on each pseudo-bulb, 3-4 cm. long and 1-1\u00b72 cm. broad, linear-lanceolate or falcately so, tapering to the base, hardly petioled, notched at the obliquely obtuse or acute apex, coriaceous, dark green above, paler beneath, margin narrowly hyaline. Scape equalling or exceeding the leaves, issuing from near the base of the pseudo-bulb, lower portion enclosed within sheaths. Flowers 3-4, umbellate. Floral bracts 5 m. long, lanceolate, acuminate, membranous, shorter than the long-stalked ovary, margins incurved. Dorsal sepal 5 m. long, quite\nfree at its base from the lateral pair, ovate, emarginate, concave and embracing the column, pale yellow with three broad reddish-purple veins; lateral sepals 2\u00b71 m., cohering at their base and adnate to the foot of the column, twisted and constricted above their auricled base, linear-lanceolate and with acuminate cucullate tips, yellow with three to four bright red veins, which become indistinct upwards. Petals a little shorter than the dorsal sepal, broadly and obliquely ovate, rounded at the apex, yellow tinged with reddish-purple at the base. Lip deflexed from about the middle, oblong, with the margins incurved and forming a deep furrow on the upper surface, very thick and fleshy, yellow with reddish-purple blotches on the basal portion of the raised margins. Column thick, with a long incurved foot; apical processes 2, triangular, setaceous.\n\nWestern Himalaya: in Tehri-Garhwal, east of Tehri, epiphytic on Rhododendron arboreum, at elevations between 5 and 6,000 feet, Mackinnon's collector.\n\nThis species is most nearly related to C. caespitosum of Wallich. It differs by having almost globular pseudo-bulbs and much longer scapes, the lateral sepals cohere at the base only; the petals are obtuse and quite entire; the shape of the lip is different, as is also the colouring of the flower. I have dedicated the species to my friend and benefactor, Sir Joseph D. Hooker, G.C.S.I., F.R.S.\n\n4. EULOPHIA CAMpanulata Duthie, n. sp.\n\nHeight of plant 9-15 dm., the leaves and scape rising from a horizontal, oblong tuber. Pseudo-stem formed by the sheaths enclosing the bases of the leaves and scape. Leaves few, linear, acuminate, 3-4\u00b75 dm. long, and about 3 cm. broad; veins sharply prominent. Scape exceeding the leaves, with a few long tight-fitting acuminate sheaths towards the base. Flowers 6-10, in a lax raceme, appearing with the leaves, about 2\u00b75 cm. in diam., erect in bud, drooping and campanulate when open. Floral bracts lanceolate, acuminate, less than half the length of the ovary. Sepals and petals prominently veined on the back, bright yellow outside and pale lemon-coloured within. Dorsal sepal obovate, cuspidate, 2 cm. long; lateral, rather shorter, falcately oblong, obtuse, or mucronate, adnate to the base of the column. Petals obovate, obtuse, about as long as the lateral sepals. Lip 3-lobed, longer than the sepals, with a short subacute conical sac at the base; side-lobes erect, large, rounded, pale yellow tinged with purple; mid-lobe bent upwards, and with reflexed undulate margin, suborbicular when flattened out; the disc with 5-8 prominent ridges terminating within the apex of the apical lobe in an oblong grooved callus, and prolonged at the base into two sets of finger-\nlike projections. *Column* about 1 cm. long, oblong, narrowly winged, curving into a short foot at the base. *Pollinia* 2, globose, attached by a cylindric caudicle to a triangular gland.\n\n**North-West India:** Dehra Dun, at Karwap\u00e1ni, *W. Bell*, and *P. W. Mackinnon\u2019s collector*; N. Oudh, at Chandanpur in the Gonda district, *Duthie\u2019s collector*.\n\nAmongst the Indian species this very handsome orchid appears to be most nearly related to *E. Mannii*, Hk. f., which is found in Sikkim and in Upper Assam. It was originally discovered in Dehra Dun in 1879 by Mr. W. Bell, formerly Head Gardener at the Saharanpur Botanical Garden, after whom I have named it.\n\n5. **EuLOPHIA MACKINNONI** Duthie, n. sp.\n\n*Rhizome* composed of a series of triangular flattened tubers. *Leaves* few, plicate, 5 to 6\u00b75 dm. long and 5 to 8 cm. broad, appearing with the flowers, broadly lanceolate, acuminate, tapering into long sheaths, and with a few leafless sheaths below; nerves prominent. *Scape* 6\u00b74 dm., arising from the swollen base of the pseudo-stem. *Flowers*, rather large, arranged in a lax raceme, spreading and afterwards deflexed. *Bracts* as long as, or shorter than, the ovary, linear, acuminate, persistent. *Sepals* and *petals* fleshy, yellow, tinged with reddish-brown, veins prominent outside. *Dorsal sepal* 1\u00b77 cm. long, ovate, obtuse, subcordate at the base, 9-veined, margin inflexed at the apex; *lateral*, a little longer than the dorsal, unequal at the base. *Petals* shorter than the sepals, oblong-obovate, obtuse, overlapping and with their margins reflexed at the apex. *Lip* 3-lobed, with long erect rather shallow side-lobes, its body with 5-7 parallel purple-coloured ridges which extend into a carunculate area within the apical lobe; apical lobe rounded, its margin undulate. *Spur* short, geniculate. *Column* rather broad, winged, with no foot. *Anther* bicornute at the apex, its lip 2-toothed. *Stigma* transverse, placed immediately under the anther. *Pollinia*, tranversely oval, attached by a broad caudicle to a shallow crescent-shaped gland.\n\n**North-West India:** Dehra Dun, *Mackinnon*; Siwalik range, *Vicary* (in Herb. Calc.); Bahraich district in N. Oudh, *Duthie\u2019s collector*; Raipur district in Cent. Provinces, *J. Marten*. In the Saharanpur herbarium there is an old specimen named \u201c*E. bicolor*\u201d which is said to have been collected near Mussoorie in October 1842.\n\nThis species is evidently allied to *E. geniculata*, King and Pantling, an extremely rare Sikkim orchid. It differs chiefly in the shape of the rhizome, the very much broader leaves, the colour of the flowers, and in the shape of the lip.\n6. **Cymbidium Mackinnoni** Duthie, n. sp.\n\nTerrestrial, caespitose. *Pseudo-stem* short, emitting many thick spongy roots. *Leaves* linear, acuminate, 3-4 dm. long and about 1.3 cm. broad; margins not serrulate, the lowest ones sheath-like and membranous. *Scape* 1-flowered, much shorter than the leaves, clothed to the base with loose lanceolate acuminate cymbiform hyaline sheaths. *Floral bract* longer than the much curved ovary, pale yellow with purple veins. *Flowers* about 5 cm. across, nodding. *Sepals and petals* spreading, green. *Sepals* lanceolate, obtuse, a little longer than the petals. *Petals* elliptic-lanceolate, obtuse, 5-nerved. *Lip* about as long as the petals, obovate-oblong (when spread out), 3-lobed, saccate at the base, very pale yellow blotched with purple; lateral lobes narrow, erect; the terminal one abruptly deflexed, rounded at the apex and nearly entire; the disk with two raised smooth lamell\u00e6 extending from the base to a little beyond the side-lobes. *Column* short, stout, curved, concave in front, marked with purple blotches like the lip. *Pollinia* 4, obliquely obovoid, plano-convex, the segments of each pair unequal, attached to a hemispherical gland. *Ripe capsule* 1.5 dm. long (including the long pedicel), ellipsoid-clavate, prominently ribbed.\n\n**Western Himalaya**: near Mussoorie, at an elevation of about 5,500 feet, growing under trees; in flower during February, *P. W. Mackinnon*.\n\nMr. Rolfe informs me that its nearest ally is *C. virescens*, Lindl., a native of Japan. Of Indian species it most nearly resembles *C. cyperifolium* in habit. It is, however, a much smaller plant, the scape is always 1-flowered, and the colouring of the lip and the shape of the pollinia and gland are very different; also the margins of the leaves are entire and not serrulate as in *C. cyperifolium*. The latter is also found in similar localities near Mussoorie, but always at a slightly higher elevation, and it comes into flower several weeks later.\n\n7. **Listera Inayati** Duthie, n. sp.\n\nWhole plant 1.5 to 2 dm. high. *Roots* fibrous. *Stem* stout, about as long as the raceme, and bearing 3-6 loosely-fitting, blunt sheaths, the two upper ones sometimes opposite and leaflike. *Flowers* in dense racemes, 4 m. long; rachis glandular-pubescent. *Floral bract* ovate or lanceolate-acuminate, a little longer than the stalk of the ovary. *Sepals and petals* connivent; *dorsal sepal* oval, concave, about 2 m. long; *lateral sepals* a little longer than the dorsal, obliquely ovate, tapering to an obtuse apex. *Petals* about as long as the dorsal sepal, spatulate, subacute.\nLip twice as long as the lateral sepals, narrowly oblong, deeply cleft at the apex, with two slightly spreading obtuse lobes, midrib thickened. Column short, stout, dilated at the base and apex. Anther suborbicular, bifid at the apex. Pollinia narrowly obovoid. Ovary oval or subglobose, about as long as its stalk, glandular-pubescent.\n\nWestern Himalaya; in the Kag\u00e1n valley of the Haz\u0101ra district. Discovered in July 1897 by Inayat Kh\u00e1n, head plant-collector of the Botanical Department of N. India (No. 22,596).\n\nA shorter and much stouter plant than L. Lindleyana, and with shorter and more densely-flowered racemes. The shape of the sepals, petals, anther and pollinia are altogether different.\n\n8. Listera microglottis Duthie, n. sp.\n\nA leafless parasite, 2-3 dm. in height. Root-fibres cylindrical, brittle, pale yellowish-brown. Stem about as long as the raceme, nearly white, bearing 2-4 loose-fitting obtuse pale sheaths. Rachis of raceme, pedicels and bracts glandular-pubescent. Flowers crowded, about 7 m. in diameter, pale green; pedicel a little longer than the ovary; floral bract equalling or exceeding the pedicel, oblong, obtuse or subacute. Sepals ovate, subacute, about 4 m. long; the lateral ones somewhat oblique. Petals as long as the sepals, linear, margins reflexed. Lip linear-spathulate, equalling the petals in length, entire at the apex, margins reflexed. Column erect, a little shorter than the petals, dilated towards its base and apex. Pollinia 2, globose, without caudicles, extremely deliquescent. Ovary with pedicel 8 m. long. Capsule turgid, its ridges thick and often bearing short, broad-based, tooth-like projections.\n\nWestern Himalaya: in Tehri-Garhw\u00e1l, east of Tehri, growing under oaks and rhododendrons at elevations between 5,000 and 6,000 feet, P. W. Mackinnon's collector; also on the wooded hillsides below Mussoorie at similar elevations. Flowers during August and September. This plant, although resembling L. Lindleyana in general habit, differs from any known species of Listera (including Neottia) by its very remarkably restricted petal-like lip.\n\n9. Aphyllorchis Gollani Duthie, n. sp.\n\nA tall leafless terrestrial herb, from 4 to 5 dm. in height. Rhizome with numerous far-extending fleshy roots, not scaly. Stem erect, stout, bearing several unequal tubular blunt sheaths. Raceme about 1 dm. long, Flowers several, 2 cm. long. Floral bract a little longer than the ovary, elliptic-lanceolate, acuminate, 5-7-nerved, at first deflexed, ultimately erect. Sepals 2 cm. long, erect, ovate-lanceolate, acuminate, with spreading tips; their nerves, as also the ridges of the clavate ovary, dark\nreddish-brown on a pale green ground. *Petals* shorter than the sepals, lanceolate, acuminate, pale green with purple veins, midrib thickened on the back. *Lip* shorter than the petals, somewhat deflexed from a concave winged claw attached to the base of the column; apical portion ovate-acuminate, its sides towards the base erect and with a reflexed erose margin, with no convexity near the apex. *Column* 1\u00b72 cm. long, stout, curved, narrowed towards the base. *Anther* 2-celled, cells parallel. *Pollinia* ovate-oblong, mealy. *Ovary* (in flower) 1\u00b77 cm. long, its apex with conspicuous granular projections between the ribs; *stigma* with an overlapping irregularly lobulate border.\n\n**Western Himalaya:** Tehri-Garhw\u00e1l, on N\u00e1g Tiba, at elevations between 8,000 and 10,000 feet, *Gollan* (No. 2,062) and *Mackinnon's collector* (No. 23,000). The original specimens, discovered in 1881 by Mr. W. Gollan, after whom I have named this plant, were in too young a condition even for determining the genus. Its nearest ally is *A. alpina*, King and Pantling, a high-elevation Sikkim species. From the above it differs chiefly in the rhizome not being scaly, the bracts become erect as the flowers open, it has much shorter racemes, the lip is attached to the base of the column and does not form a pouch, the epichyle has no concavity at its apex, the colouring of the flowers is also very different.\n\n10. **Pogonia Mackinnoni** Duthie, n. sp.\n\n*Tuber* globose, annular and warted, about 1\u00b72 cm. in diameter. *Leaf* and *scape* frequently from the same tuber, but not contemporaneous. *Leaf* about 5 cm. long and broad, cordate at the base, 7-lobed, terminal lobe acute, the others rounded, principal veins terminating at the end of each lobe, with many less conspicuous intermediate ones; *petiole*, 2\u00b75 cm. long. Leaves from the flowering tubers much smaller. *Scape* 1-flowered, about 10 cm. long when in flower, elongating till fruiting, enclosed by two or three rather loose tubular sheaths. *Flower* shortly pedicelled, spreading; *bract* erect, shorter than the cylindrical truncate ovary. *Sepals* spreading, linear-lanceolate, acuminate, 1\u00b76 to 1\u00b77 cm. long, light green blotched with reddish-brown outside. *Petals* very similar to the sepals, but a little shorter and not so acute at the apex. *Lip* shorter than the petals, oblong when spread out, strongly 3-nerved, white tinged with green towards the base; side-lobes erect, acute; terminal-lobe blotched with purple. *Column* slender, 7\u00b78 m. long. *Pollinia* 2, narrowly clavate, connate below and without a gland.\n\n**Western Himalaya:** near Mussoorie, at elevations between 4,500 and 6,000 feet, *P. W. Mackinnon*. Flowers during May and June.\n\nVery similar in habit to *P. macroglossa*, King and Pantling, but the\nleaves are more distinctly lobed; the flowers are much smaller, and are spreading, not drooping. Leaves and fruiting scapes are sometimes found on the same tuber.\n\n11. **Herminium Mackinnoni** Duthie, n. sp.\n\nWhole plant upwards of 2\u00b72 dm. high. *Tubers* narrowly oblong. Lower portion of the stem clothed with a few close-fitting tubular subacute sheaths. *Leaves* two, 12-14 cm. long by 1-2 cm. broad, oblong or linear-lanceolate, acuminate, with loosely amplexicaul tubular bases, 3-5-veined. *Spike* cylindric, rather broad, about 11 cm. long, many-flowered. *Flowers*, spreading, crowded, about 10 m. across. *Floral bract*, 5 m. long, broadly lanceolate, acuminate, a little shorter than the ovary. *Sepals* 3-4 m., ovate-oblong, acute, subterete, green. *Petals* as long as the sepals, linear-lanceolate, divergent, white. *Lip* trifid, a little longer than the petals, deflexed from near its base, white with a slight tinge of green, margins inflexed, lower portion very thick and with a small concavity at the base; side-lobes filiform, curved inwards; midlobe about half as long as the side-lobes, lanceolate, obtuse. *Anther-cells*, diverging below; *pollinia* obovate; *caudicles*, very short, the glands discoid, naked; *staminodes* large, spreading. *Stigmas* 2, transversely oblong and lying between the pollinia-glands and the concavity of the lip. *Ovary* about 6 m. long, ovate-oblong, beaked.\n\n*Western Himalaya*: near Mussoorie, at about 6,500 feet, on oak trees, *P. W. Mackinnon*. Flowers in August.\n\nA very distinct species, its nearest ally being *H. angustifolium*. It differs from the latter by its fewer much shorter and broader leaves, its shorter and broader flowering spike, white petals and lip, and with the mid-lobe of the latter much longer; the shape of the ovary is also very different.\n\n12. **Habenaria Elisabethae** Duthie, n. sp.\n\nHeight of plant up to 4\u00b75 dm. *Bulbs* ovoid. *Leaves* 2-3, approximate towards the base of the stem, with a few lanceolate finely acuminate sheaths above and a few loose ones below them, 6\u00b712 cm. long and 1 to 2 cm. broad, lanceolate, the upper acuminate, the lowest one acute or obtuse, amplexicaul at the base, midrib prominent beneath. *Spike* long and slender, sometimes up to 2\u00b75 dm. *Flowers* sessiles, small, green, rather crowded, horizontal or deflexed. *Bracts* lanceolate, acuminate, about half as long as the ovary. *Sepals* erect, the dorsal one ovate, concave, the lateral ones obliquely ovate. *Petals* a little longer than the sepals, obliquely ovate, obtuse. *Lip* 3-cleft, fleshy, longer than the sepals, with a long concave claw; lateral lobes linear, spreading, gibbons\nat their basal edges; midlobe oblong, obtuse, not exceeding the lateral ones. Spur a short obovate sac, \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\) the length of the ovary. Anther-cells parallel. Pollinia obovate, curved, attached by a short caudicle to an oval gland. Stigmatic processes clavate. Ovary tapering upwards and curved.\n\n**Western Himalaya:** Song, at 8,000 ft. Brandis; near Simla, Edgeworth, Lady E. Babington-Smith; near Naini Tal, up to 8,000 feet, Colonel Davidson; Tehri-Garhwal, 7,000 to 10,000 feet., Duthie (524 and 22,990), P. W. Mackinnon; also at Mussoorie, between 6,000 and 7,000 feet, frequently as an epiphyte on oak trees.\n\nOf the Himalayan species of *Habenaria* this plant appears to be most nearly related to *H. goodyeroides*. It differs principally in having much narrower and thinner leaves, and they are placed much lower down on the stem. The flowering spikes are longer and narrower; the flowers are much smaller and altogether green; the floral bracts are shorter, and the shape of the lip is very different. I have much pleasure in dedicating this species to Lady Elizabeth Babington-Smith, whose keen and practical interest in the botany of Simla during the Viceroyalty of her father, Lord Elgin, resulted in several interesting discoveries.\nIII.\u2014Materials for a Flora of the Malayan Peninsula.\u2014By Sir George King, K.C.I.E., M.B., LL.D., F.R.S., &c., late Superintendent of the Royal Botanic Garden, Calcutta.\n\nNo. 13.\n\nThe present contribution carries these Materials to the end of the Calyciflor\u00e6. The orders included in it are Datiscace\u00e6, Droserace\u00e6, Passiflorace\u00e6, Begoniace\u00e6, Ficoid\u00e6, Umbellifer\u00e6, and Cornace\u00e6. It has not been possible for me to prepare my account of the Calycifloral orders in the exact sequence followed in Hooker's Flora of British India; each order, however, bears the ordinal number given to it in that work. The species described in the present paper are 47 in number, and of these fourteen belonging to the genus Begonia, and two belonging to Mastixia, are new to science. I hope in future contributions to take up the orders belonging to the groups Corolliflor\u00e6 and Incomplet\u00e6.\n\nOrder LXVII. DATISCACE\u00c6.\n\nTrees or herbs.

Cambodia, Khasia Hills and Eastern Bengal, tropical Eastern Himalaya.\n\nA species well marked by its deeply cordate leaves much reticulate on the lower surface, widely-spreading cymes and sub-rotund cancellate pitted seeds. Some confusion in nomenclature has arisen from the fact that Kurz, without having seen authentic specimens of Blume's two species *Modecca cordifolia* and *M. heterophylla* referred this plant to both of them. Dr. Masters perpetuated part of Kurz's mistake by accepting his view as to the identity of this Andaman and Nicobar plant with *M. cordifolia*, Blume, whereas the whole of the Andaman material (greatly increased in bulk since he wrote) really belongs to his own species *M. cardiophylla*. This view was first expressed by Dr. D. Prain, Superintendent of the Calcutta Garden in a note on one of the specimens in the Herbarium there.\n\n4. *Adenia populifolia*, Engl. in Jahrb.

Java.\n\nA species badly represented in collections and misunderstood. It is based on the plant collected by Wallich at Singapore and issued by him under his Cat. No. 1232 and named Passiflora singaporeana. With this agree absolutely a plant collected by Mr. Hullett and myself at Jaffaria (in Johore) also some specimens collected by Mr. H. O. Forbes in the Preanger in Java (Herb. Forbes 565). Maingay collected at Malacca six specimens of a Modecca all of which in Herb. Kew. are named M. singaporeana. In my opinion five of these belong to M. acuminata, Bl. I have seen no flowers of M. singapoeana and the account of them given above is copied verbatim from Masters. The leaves are very opaque and of a dull pale colour beneath, and the nerves are very faint. The fruit is slightly shorter than that of M. acuminata, Bl. of which species this is I fear little more than a form.\n\nOrder LII.

Actual specimens of the two look more different than written descriptions lead one to suppose; I therefore retain this as a species.\n\n6. Begonia debilis, King n. sp. A slender weak herb, about 6 to 8 inches high, caulescent. Leaves thin, narrowly reniform, blunt or sub-acute; the base unequal, rounded at both sides but one auriculate and\nmuch longer; edges sub-entire or slightly remotely and obscurely crenate; breadth 1\u00b75 to 3 in.; length (from base of largest lobe to apex) 3\u00b75 to 7 in.; upper surface glabrous, the lower minutely scaly; main-nerves 7, radiating from the base, some of them branching, rather prominent below; petioles 1 to 3 in. long. Inflorescence axillary or terminal, slender, longer than the leaves, with a few lax filiform dichotomous spreading few-flowered branches, bracts in pairs, ovate-lanceolate, '1 to '15 in. long. Flowers pure white, the stamens yellow. Male '35 in. across; sepals 2, oblong-ovate, blunt; petals 2, similar but smaller; stamens in a globular mass; anthers obovate, short with broad emarginate inappendiculate apices. Female perianth of 5 unequal obliquely oblong pieces; styles united into a short column, above divided into numerous crowded awns. Capsule '75 in. broad (to the end of the wings), and '4 in. from base to apex, glabrous, 2-celled: the 2 lateral wings triangular, acute, the posterior wing oblong, tapering a little to the blunt apex, more than twice as long as the lateral.\n\nPerak; King's Collector 8289.\n\nA species allied to B. varians, A. DC., but with more entire leaves.\n\n7. Begonia thaipingensis, King n. sp. Rhizome long, creeping, rooting at intervals, wire-like, rusty-villous. Leaves rotund-reniform, the edges minutely and rather remotely dentate, the basal sinus mostly obliterated by the overlapping of the auricles; both surfaces scaly the lower more distinctly so and rusty tomentose on the 6 or 7 radiating sub-prominent nerves; length 1\u00b725 to 2 in.; breadth 1\u00b75 to 2\u00b725 in.; petioles unequal, 1 to 4 in. long, densely rusty-tomentose. Peduncles 4 to 9 in. long, slender, sparsely rusty-villous, bearing one or two remote pairs of small lanceolate bracts and near the apex 3 to 5 slenderly pedicellate pink flowers on slender branches. Male flowers; sepals 2, sub-rotund, '15 in. long; petals 2, smaller, oblong; stamens numerous; anthers obovate, the apex blunt and emarginate, the filaments short. Female perianth of 5 unequal pieces, the largest most external; style short, thick, with 2 stout arms and short thick twisted stigmas. Capsule 2-celled, '5 in. broad (to the ends of the wings); all the wings triangular, sub-equal.\n\nPerak; Scortechini 1479; Wray 1774; King's Collector 2523, 8511.\n\nA species allied to B. sinuata, Wall., but differing by the creeping rhizome, non-apiculate leaves, rusty-tomentose petioles and peduncles.\n\n8. Begonia guttata, Wall. Cat. 3671 A. Stem succulent, short, weak, bearing about two thin obliquely ovate-reniform glabrous nearly entire leaves with oblique cordate bases, and subacute apices; the nerves about 5, radiating from the base, prominent, sparsely hairy;\n4 to 7 in. long and 2 to 4.5 in. broad; petioles 1.5 to 4 in. Peduncles varying in length from 1 to 2 in., slender, glabrous, bearing a few flowers near the apex. Male flower; sepals 2, rotund; petals 2, narrowly oblong; stamens about 50, monadelphous; anthers obovoid. Female; perianth-segments 5, gradually smaller inwards: styles 2, with two twisted branches.

All parts glabrous. Stem a creeping rhizome. Leaves rotund-ovate, shortly and abruptly caudate-acuminate, peltate, the edges wavy but entire; both surfaces glabrous, the upper pitted when dry, the lower with sub-rotund scales; main-nerves about ten, radiating from the insertion of the petiole, not very prominent; length 3.5 to 5.5 in.; breadth 2.25 to 3.75 in.; petiole attached to the leaf about .75 to 1.25 in. from its lower edge; stipules short, lanceolate. Peduncle usually longer than the leaves (often twice as long), about as thick as the petioles, bearing a few slender branches near the apex, ebracteate. Flowers small, white tipped with red. Male 2 in. broad; sepals 2, reniform, the margins thick. Stamens numerous, cuneiform-oblong, their apices emarginate; filaments very short, free. Female, sepals 2, with vertical veins, reniform; style short, thick, with 4 short branches; stigmas 4, much lobulate. Capsule 4-celled, 6 in. long, the lateral wings very narrow; the posterior broad slightly narrowed to the blunt apex, 5 in. long: seeds minute, ovoid, tapering to one end, brown, shining, pitted.

Java, Zollinger 1613.\n\nThis is one of three species to which the specific name peltata has been given. That name must however be reserved for the Brazilian species to which it was first applied by Otto & Dietr. (Allg. Gartenz. IX (1841) 58). The MSS. name B. Hasskarliana was given by Miquel to a species near B. coespitosa which he confused with Zollinger's No. 1613 (the type of the species above described), and this inaccuracy was perpetuated by Miquel on p. 1091 of his Fl. Ind. Bat. I, Pt. I, where he describes Diploclinium Hasskarlianum.\n\n10. Begonia Scortechinii, King, n. sp. Rhizome creeping, short, scaly.\nLeaves on very long glabrous petioles, narrowly lanceolate, attenuate to the acuminate apex, and to the rounded or acute nearly equal-sided base; the edges dentate-ciliate; both surfaces with numerous scattered coarse subulate spreading hairs compressed at their bases, the lower also minutely scaly; main-nerves pinnate, 3 or 4 pairs, then ascending; length 2\u00b775 to 4 in.; breadth '5 to 1 in.; petioles 5 to 7 in. Peduncles axillary, somewhat shorter than the leaves, glabrous, bearing at the apex 2 few-flowered branches and a few rather long bracts. Flowers white, tinged with pink and green. Male: sepals ovate, obtuse, '75 in. long; petals narrower but nearly as long. Stamens numerous, in a short column; anthers linear-oblong, the apical appendage obtuse; filaments short. Female with perianth-segments similar to the male (fide Scortechini) but 5. Ovary glabrous, 2-celled; styles free, 2 to 4-fid. Capsule '75 in. broad (including the wings) the lateral wings narrow, oblong, the posterior much larger (fide Scortechini).\n\nPerak; Scortechini 1845; King's Collector 7227.\n\nI have seen no ripe capsules, and the above description of them is taken from Scortechini's field-note. The species is readily distinguishable by its very narrow equal-sided coarsely hairy leaves. A drawing of this, sent to Herb. Kew from Penang by Mr. C. Curtis, represents the leaf-petioles as not more than one inch long.\n\n11. Begonia Kunstleriana, King n. sp. Rhizome creeping, very scaly. Leaves ovate-lanceolate to lanceolate, often but not always unequal-sided, much acuminate; the base cuneate usually oblique; edges ciliate-serrate, the teeth slightly unequal; both surfaces with coarse spreading hairs with dilated flattened bases; the lower with minute white scales also; main-nerves about 3 pairs, pinnate, densely rufescent villous like the petioles; length 5 to 7\u00b75 in.; breadth 1\u00b775 to 2\u00b75 in.; petiole from half as long to nearly as long as the blade. Peduncles longer than the petioles and more slender, glabrous, 2- to 4-flowered at the apex. Flowers large, white, tinged with red. Male; sepals 2, elliptic, obtuse, 1 in. long and '5 in. broad, vertically veined; petals similar but not half so large. Stamens numerous, linear-oblong, bluntly apiculate. Female perianth of 5 oblong blunt segments; styles 2, each with two short twisted branches. Capsule (to the end of the posterior wing) 1 in. broad: the lateral wings short, narrow; the posterior elongate not tapered to the apex, 2-celled. Seeds ellipsoid, shining, brown, pitted.\n\nPerak; King's Collector 7194; Scortechini; Ridley 9651.\n\nThis resembles B. Scortechinii, but has larger leaves and shorter petioles which are densely villous.\n\n12. Begonia Herveyana, King n. sp. Glabrous except for a few\nhairs on the nerves on the lower surface of the leaves: rhizome creeping, thin. Leaves broadly elliptic-ovate, shortly acuminate, slightly narrowed to the rounded almost equal-sided base; the edges slightly undulate, very indistinctly serrate; upper surface glabrous, lower very minutely scaly; nerves pinnate, about 6 pairs, ascending, branching; length 5 to 9 in.; breadth 3 to 4\u00b75 in.; petioles much longer than the leaves, glabrous; stipules lanceolate, inconspicuous.

Female perianth of 5 subrotund pieces. Capsule 1 in. broad and about half as much from base to apex, imperfectly 4-celled: lateral wings narrow oblong; the posterior wing ovate, blunt, about \u00b765 in. long.\n\nMalacca; Hervey; Derry.\n\nThis is a very distinct species resembling in the shape of its leaves no Asiatic Begonia that I have seen, except an unnamed species from Tonkin (No. 3763 of Herb. Balansa).\n\n13. Begonia Perakensis, King n. sp. Rhizome slender, creeping. Leaves ovate-lanceolate, slightly unequal-sided, acuminate; the base broad, rounded or very slightly emarginate or oblique, the edges obscurely and remotely dentate, or sub-entire; both surfaces glabrous, the lower minutely scaly; main-nerves pinnate, 4 or 5 pairs, ascending; length 3\u00b75 to 5\u00b75 in.; breadth 1\u00b75 to 2\u00b725 in.; petiole 2\u00b75 to 5 in.; slender, glabrous. Peduncles usually longer than the leaves (at least when in fruit), 4-angled, glabrous, few-flowered. Flowers whitish tinged with pink, or pink. Male; sepals rotund-ovate, \u00b74 in. long. Petals 2, oblong and much smaller. Stamens numerous, linear with short blunt apical appendages and short filaments. Female perianth of 5 (?) segments. Capsule (ripe) 1\u00b72 in. broad (to end of posterior wing), and \u00b75 in. from base to apex, 2-celled; the lateral wings oblong, narrow; the posterior oblong, blunt, slightly oblique, \u00b735 in. broad; seeds small, ellipsoid, pitted, shining.\n\nPerak; King's Collector 10338, 10506, 10951.\n\nSpecimens of a species closely resembling this, but insufficient for accurate determination, have been collected in Selangor by Mr. Ridley (Herb. Ridley 8590).\n\n14. Begonia Paupercula, King n. sp. Rhizome creeping, acaulescent, everywhere glabrous. Leaves ovate, very unequal-sided and very oblique at the base, or ovate-lanceolate, slightly unequal-sided and little oblique at the base; the apex always acuminate, the edges slightly sinuate-lobed, obscurely dentate; both surfaces glabrous; main-nerves 5 to 7, radiating from the base, prominent below, midrib with a few\nlateral nerves, length 3\u00b75 to 5 in.; breadth 1\u00b725 to 3\u00b75 in.; petioles varying in length from 2\u00b75 to 7 in., slender, 2-to 3-flowered. Flowers white, tinged with red. MALES; sepals 2, elliptic-oblong, '4 in. long; petals 0. Stamens linear-oblong, shortly and bluntly apiculate: filaments short. FEMALE; the perianth of 5 very unequal lobes, the outermost larger than the sepals of the male. Capsules '6 in. long and 1 in. broad, 2-celled; the lateral wings sub-elliptic, oblique, '3 in. broad; the posterior wing oblong, blunt, '6 to '7 in long and '35 in. broad.\n\nPerak; King's Collector 5952.\n\nThis has leaves resembling those of B. borneensis, but the flowers are fewer and larger. Beccari's Sumatra specimens (P.S. 857), in fruit only, appear to belong to this species.\n\n15. Begonia venusta, King n. sp. Rhizome slender, creeping; whole plant glabrous. Leaves reniformly ovate, shortly acuminate, the basal sinus deep; the edges sub-entire or remotely and minutely denticulate; both surfaces smooth, shining: main-nerves 7, radiating from the base, slender; length 3 to 5\u00b75 in.; breadth 2 to 3\u00b75 in.; petioles unequal, slender, from 6 to 12 in. in length. Peduncles 3\u00b75 to 6 in. long, bearing about 3 pedunculate pinkish-white flowers near the apex. MALE; sepals 2, ovate-rotund, blunt, '75 in. long. Petals 2, somewhat larger. Stamens narrowly oblong, with a large apiculus; filaments unequal, the inner ones long, the outer short. FEMALE smaller than the male, the perianth of 5 unequal broad blunt segments; styles very short, with numerous broad depressed lobules. Capsule '3 in. long and 1\u00b715 in. broad (to the ends of the wings); lateral wings more than half as long as the posterior, broadly triangular, blunt; posterior wing oblong, blunt, '7 in. long.\n\nPerak; at an elevation of about 6,000 ft., Wray 1598.\n\nThe leaves are not unlike those of B. paupercula and B. borneensis but the flowers are large and handsome.\n\n16. Begonia megapteroidea, King n. sp. Rhizome as thick as a swan-quill, creeping on rocks. Leaves broadly and very obliquely ovate, acuminate; both sides of the base rounded but very unequal, the sinus between them wide, the edges remotely and minutely dentate, upper surface glabrous; the lower also glabrous except the rusty-pubescent nerves which are also scaly near the base: main-nerves about 8, radiating from the base, the larger branched and all rather prominent; length (from apex of petiole to apex of blade) 4 to 5 in.; breadth 4 to 5 in.; petiole 12 to 16 in. long, glabrous. Peduncles from half as long to nearly as long as the leaves, glabrous, ebracteate below the flowers. MALE flowers: sepals rotund-ovate, very obtuse, 1 in. long and '6 to '7 in. broad; petals much smaller, elliptic: stamens numerous, in a conical\nmass on a short thick anthophore; anthers oblong, bluntly apiculate, filaments varying in length (the inner the longest). Female perianth of 5 unequal pieces: styles 2, rather long, combined at the base. Capsule not seen.\n\nPerak; collected at an elevation of 5,000 ft., Wray 1450, 1573.\n\nSpecimens of this plant are rather scanty. They resemble B. megaptera, but are not caulescent like that species. In the Calcutta Herbarium there is, under the name Diploclinium tuberosum, Miq., a specimen collected by Kurz in Western Java which apparently belongs to this species. There are also two plants from Sumatra collected by Forbes (Herb. Forbes 2333a and 2255) which appear to belong to this. The genus Diploclinium is inseparable from Begonia and the specific name tuberosa is pre-occupied in the latter by a species described by Lamack from the Moluccas which has a rounded tuberous root.\n\n17. Begonia Maxwelliana, King n. sp. Rhizome as thick as a swan-quill, bearing many broadly lanceolate scales. Leaves broadly and obliquely ovate to ovate-rotund, more or less acuminate, the edges minutely ciliate-denticulate, the base very oblique, one side of it rounded the other rounded-auriculate, the sinus wide; both surfaces with a few coarse compressed rusty hairs, most numerous on the nerves near the base; the lower surface with minute white scales; main-nerves 7 to 9, radiating from the base, prominent; length 5 to 6 in.; breadth 4 to 7 in.; petioles 4 to 10 in. long, compressed (when dry) like the peduncles and like them rusty-pubescent. Peduncles unequal, those bearing only male flowers often shorter than the petioles; those bearing female and male, or females only often longer than the petioles; all ebracteate below the inflorescence, dichotomously branched and few-flowered at the apex; the bracts short, broad. Male flowers densely clustered; sepals 2, oblong-ovate, blunt, '4 in. long, puberulous outside; petals 2, similar, but much smaller. Stamens numerous, without anthophore; anthers linear, bluntly apiculate, slightly shorter than the filaments. Female perianth of 5 unequal pieces diminishing in size inwards; styles 2, short, much lobulate. Capsule 2-celled, 1\u00b74 in. broad (to the ends of the wings) and '6 in from base to apex; the 2 lateral wings sub-quadrate, obtuse; the posterior oblong, blunt, more than three times as long as the lateral.\n\nPerak; Maxwell's Hill, at elevation of 3,000 feet, Wray 119, 2199; Scortechini 1607, 1798; King's Collector 2038.\u2014Distrib. Sumatra, Forbes 3119a.\n\nThe flowers of this are white tinged with pink and the leaves green, the nerves beneath being red. This resembles B. megapteroidea, King, but the flowers are smaller, and the leaves and inflorescence are not glabrous as in that species.\n\n18. Begonia praecara, King n. sp. Rhizome creeping, very scaly. Leaves obliquely ovate, acuminate, the base rounded on one side of the\npetiole and on the other expanding into a broad rounded auricle, the edges minutely dentate, rarely with small lobes besides: upper surface with numerous conical papillae each bearing a coarse curved hair flattened at the base; under surface with a few scattered flattened hairs especially on the nerves; main-nerves 7, radiating from the base, prominent beneath; length 3\u00b75 to 5\u00b75 in.; breadth 2\u00b75 to 3\u00b75 in.; petioles unequal 3 to 6 in. long, with a few flexuose hairs near the apex. Peduncles longer than the petioles, slender, glabrous, 1- to 3-flowered. Flowers on rather long slender pedicels, pink. MALES; sepals 2, narrowly oblong-ovate, obtuse, \u00b78 in. long; petals 2, narrowly oblong, blunt, \u00b75 in. long; stamens linear-oblong, apiculate, the filaments unequal the central the largest. FEMALE perianth unknown; styles 2, short, 2-branched, branches divided into many flat twisted lobes. Capsule \u00b75 in. long and about 1\u00b75 in. broad (to the ends of the wings); the lateral wings quadrate-ovate, obtuse, about \u00b74 in. long; the posterior oblong, blunt, 1 in. long and \u00b74 in. broad.\n\nPerak; at elevations of from 3,000 to 6,700 feet, Wray 318, 349, 427; King's Collector 8077.\n\nThe upper surface of the leaves is dark green, the nerves being coloured; the under surface is red of various tints and the flower-stalks are pale crimson.\n\n19. Begonia Lowiana, King n. sp. Caulescent; 3 feet high; stems and branches covered with coarse flexuose glandular hairs. Leaves mostly very obliquely reniform; but some of the cauline ovate and nearly equal-sided acute, the basal sinus deep, the edges with a few very shallow lobes closely and rather minutely dentate-serrate and shortly ciliate; both surfaces coarsely rusty-pubescent, the hairs flexuose compressed and with dilated bases, the lower also with small white scales; main-nerves about 9, radiating from the base, prominent and densely villous; length 3 to 4\u00b75 in.; breadth 4 to 7 in.; petioles unequal, stout, villous like the under surface of the ribs and midrib, from \u00b74 in. long in the upper leaves, to 4 in. long in the lower. Cymes few-flowered, leaf-opposed and terminal, shorter than the leaves when in flower, much larger when in fruit; bracts ovate-lanceolate, opposite, ciliate. Flowers pink or white, pedicellate. Male about \u00b775 in. across; sepals 2, ovate-oblong, sub-acute, \u00b75 in. long; petals 2, oblong, much smaller. Stamens numerous, oblong, blunt, without apical appendages; filaments short. Female, the perianth of 5 pieces decreasing in size inwards; styles 2, deeply bifid and spiral. Capsules \u00b765 in. long and twice as broad to the end of the wings; lateral wings very narrow (about \u00b715 in. broad), the posterior oblique, broadly ovate, blunt, \u00b79 in. long and \u00b78 in. broad.\nPerak; at an elevation of 7,000 feet on Gunong Brumber Pahang, Wray 1567; also on Gunong Batu Puleh, Wray 316.\n\nThis resembles the Indian species *B. Thomsonii*, DC., but differs in being caulescent, in having shorter hairs on leaves and petioles, and in the posterior wing of the capsule being much larger.

Cal. specimens belonging to four distinct species of Mastixia which are too imperfect to be named, and which I have been unable to match with any already described species. These are as follows:\n\n(a). Two gatherings (Wray 1234 and King\u2019s Collector 2907) of a plant collected at an elevation of from 3000 to 3400 feet in Perak which is evidently a Mastixia. In their leaves these resemble M. Maingayi, Clarke, var. sub-tomentosa, King; but the under surfaces are more glabrous and the main-nerves are rather more oblique than in that plant; the young branches are moreover of a dark colour and almost glabrous, while those of M. Maingayi are pale and rufescently tomentose. These specimens are in fruit, and none of them has a single flower. The fruit is narrowly ellipsoid, attenuate gradually to the apex, smooth, 1\u00b72 in. long, and \u00bc in. in diam. While the leaves suggest a relationship to M. Maingayi, the remains of the calyx-lobes at the apex of the fruit, which are 4-lobed, suggest perhaps a still closer affinity to the tetramerous species M. Clarkeana, King.\n\n(b). A specimen from Penang (Herb. Curtis 919) which is in fruit only.\n\n(c). Specimens of a tetramerous species (in fruit only) from the Andamans with leaves otherwise like those of M. pentandra, Bl., but obscurely serrate.\n(d). Two specimens collected by Mr. Wray at an elevation of 6,700 feet in Perak. These are in fruit; their leaves resemble those of *M. gracilis*, King, but have the main-nerves fewer but bolder.\n\n2. **ALANGIUM**, Lamk.\n\nShrubs or trees. *Leaves* alternate, petiolate, entire, persistent. *Flowers* in axillary fascicles or short cymes, hermaphrodite, hairy, jointed on their pedicels; bracts small or 0. *Calyx*-tube adnate to the ovary, the limb toothed or truncate. *Petals* 5 or 6 (rarely more), linear-oblong, valvate, sometimes becoming reflexed. *Stamens* equal in number to or twice as many as the petals or more; the anthers, long, linear; the filaments short compressed, often hairy. *Ovary* inferior, 1- to 3-celled, or 1-celled at the apex and 2- to 3-celled at the base, surmounted by a fleshy disc: *style* very long often clavate; *stigma* large, capitate or pyramidal; *ovule* pendulous. *Fruit* a berry, often with very scanty pulp, crowned by the slightly enlarged calyx. *Seed* oblong, compressed; albumen fleshy, sometimes ruminant; cotyledons leafy, flat or crumpled: radicle long or short.\u2014DISTRIB.

Prain.\n\n[Received February 26th; Read March 6th, 1902.]\n\nAmong the Orchids that flowered in the Royal Botanic Garden, Calcutta, during 1901, one of the most beautiful was a Dendrobium that differs from any of the Indian species hitherto described. To be assured that the plant is in reality a previously unknown species a drawing from life has been compared with the material and drawings preserved in the great national collection at Kew. The following description of the plant is now therefore offered.\n\nDENDROBIUM REGIUM Prain; caulibus erectis parum compressis; foliis oblongo-lanceolatis versus apicem oblique retusum vel incisum augustatis; floribus 2-3 pedunculo brevi subracemosis, pedunculis e caulis aphylli nodis orientibus; sepalis lineari-oblongis obtusis roseo-purpureis lineis rubro-purpureis notatis; petulis ellipticis roseo-purpureis lineis rubro-purpureis reticulatis; mento brevi lato; labio lituiformi aliquantum angustato, limbo roseo-purpureo lineis rubro-purpureis reticulato, glabro; tubo pallide flavo.\n\nHAB. In provinciis Hindustaniae inferioribus.\n\nStems 8-12 cm. long, 1\u00b73 cm. thick; nodes 3 cm. apart. Leaves 8-40 cm. long, 1\u00b75 cm. wide, tips distinctly obliquely notched. Peduncles 2 cm. and pedicels 4 cm. long; bracteoles adpressed, lanceolate, under 1 cm. long. Flowers 8 cm. across, magenta with darker lines and transverse markings; mentum 1\u00b725 cm. long; sepals 1 cm. and petals 2\u00b775 cm. wide; lip 4 cm. long.\n\nThis species is very nearly related to D. nobile Lindl. but is quite distinct from any of the known varieties of that somewhat variable species. In the nearly uniform coloration of the sepals and petals (though not in the colour itself) it approaches most closely the form of D. nobile distinguished and figured by Lindley, Sertum t. 18, as D. coeruleascens. That plant, however, has a lip with purple throat and yellow margin; the present species has a cream-coloured tube and throat with a magenta limb coloured and marked like the petals and sepals. The lip of D. regium s, moreover, narrower than in any form of D. nobile and is not pubescent.\nV.\u2014On some cases of Abrupt Variation in Indian Birds.\u2014By F. Finn, B.A., F.Z.S., Deputy Superintendent of the Indian Museum.\n\n[Received February 26th; Read March 5th, 1902.]\n\nI. Albinistic variation in Dissemurus paradiseus, Aethiopsar fuscus, Acridotheres tristis, and Pavoncella pugnax.\n\nThe albinistic and other varieties which so frequently occur everywhere among birds are too frequently passed over by ornithologists as mere \"freaks\" unworthy of careful consideration; yet every now and then occurs an instance of sudden and abrupt variation, of a type which when found constantly is unhesitatingly allowed the rank of a species.\n\nIt is true that the majority of albinistic specimens belong to a form which appears no more capable of maintaining itself in nature than is the perfect pink-eyed albino; at any rate, just as no pink-eyed species of bird exists in the wild state, so we also find that no species is splashed, pied, or mottled in the irregular manner characteristic of many domestic birds and of the usual pied variety which occurs in wild ones.\n\nSuch a specimen is the pied Bhimraj (Dissemurus paradiseus) figured on Plate I., in contrast with the type of the species named by me (J.A.S.B. LXVIII, Pt. II. p. 119) Dissemurus alcockii; I have been induced to refigure the latter in order to show that it is no mere albinism. The pied bird had the base of the bill partly whitish, and even some of the rictal bristles white; it is the only pied specimen of this species I have ever seen, and I have examined many, both alive and dead.\n\nA more interesting and much rarer type of variety, however, is that in which the markings are similar to those occurring in a natural species. Such an one is the specimen of the Jungle Mynah (Aethiopsar fuscus) figured on plate II; and catalogued by Anderson (Cat. Birds, Mus. As. Soc. interleaved Museum copy) as \"577, one, albino, Moulmein, Major Tickell.\"* In this bird the general plumage is white, with the quills, both primary and secondary, and the tail feathers normally coloured. The greater coverts are partly white and partly normal, and thus I am inclined to suspect that this is a similar case to one which I have recently observed in the Common Mynah (Acridotheres tristis). In this bird the plumage was originally all white, with the eyes, bill and feet normal. Mr. Rutledge kept it for some time, and it began to change\n\n* This colouration of white body and dark quills and tail is normal in the Javan Graculipica melanoptera, a bird which I was able to study in life in the London Zoological Gardens in 1901. Since writing this paper I have seen another grizzled specimen of Dissemurus paradiseus.\n\nJ. ii. 11\ninto the normal plumage, remaining for some time white with normal wings and tail, like the present bird. It is now in a very peculiar condition, being only scantily covered with feathers, some white and some normal. It has for a companion a normally-coloured bird, which, as I can personally testify, was once white, though not so completely so.\n\nAnother case of albinism of unusual interest is furnished by the white-headed form of the Ruff (Pavoncella pugnax), which is apparently not uncommon, at all events in Eastern specimens of this bird. Though the male is so well known to be exceedingly variable when in summer plumage, it is as constant in colour during the winter as other birds. Yet every now and then there appears a specimen in winter plumage with the head and neck more or less white, varying from complete whiteness of these parts to merely a white nape and unusually white fore-neck. All of the birds thus characterized are adults, as is shown by their orange or flesh-coloured feet (these being olive in the young); and the females or Reeves are thus affected as well as the Ruffs, but far more rarely and to a less extent.\n\nIn the stuffed pair figured in Plate III., which are part of the Asiatic Society's collection, and were procured by Blyth during the years 1842-1846, the whole head and neck are white with the exception of the crown, which is mostly normal, and of some scattered brown feathers on the neck. They are numbered 1601B (the female) and 1601K (the male).\n\nIn a skin (2340 in the Museum Register) procured on in the Calcutta Bazaar, February 19th, 1875 evidently a male from the dimensions, the whole head, neck and upper breast are white, there are a few white feathers on the upper back, and the coverts along the fore-arm and carpus are partly white. This is figured in the plate, together with another male (Reg. No. 24005) obtained this winter (January 30th, 1902), which is even whiter, having more white feathers on the back and fore-arm, and one tertiary white. In this the feet and base of bill were flesh-coloured; the eyes normal.\n\nSix more specimens of the variation have been obtained by me in the Calcutta Bazaar during the present winter, all being adult males. One (Reg. No. 24006) is whiter than either of those figured, having the upper back largely white, as well as all the head and breast, but no abnormal amount on the wings.\n\nThe second whitest specimen, (Reg. No. 24007) procured on February 2nd, has a white head and neck, with normally coloured feathers round the face; it had the feet and base of bill orange.\n\nOf the others, one, procured on February 16th (Reg. No. 24018) closely resembles Blyth's male figured; another, procured on February\n3rd (Reg. No. 24024) is also similar, but has the back of the neck normal; one, procured on February 22nd (Reg. No. 24019) has the head normal and the neck white all round; and a rather small specimen, obtained on February 11th (Reg. No. 24008) has the neck all white in front and the head and back of the neck merely mottled with white.\n\nThis nearly approaches the normal form, in which the fore-neck shows a varying amount of white; but any white on the crown or nape may fairly be called an abrupt variation.\n\nI have not this year been able to procure any specimens of this variety in good enough condition to keep alive, but early last year I was more fortunate, and got two pairs, most of which are still living in the Alipore Zoological Garden. Both males much resemble the mounted male figured, but one has some tertaries white in both wings at the present time, though when obtained it only showed white in one wing. The one female which remains alive merely has the neck white all round.\n\nDuring last winter I remember seeing one male largely white-necked, which was dead, and I therefore did not buy it, not then attaching so much importance to the variety, as I had seen so few.\n\nIt is only during the last two winters that I have taken special notice of this species, but I could not very well have overlooked the conspicuous white-headed form had it occurred commonly before; and it is to be noted that these last two winters have been noteworthy for unusually numerous occurrences of the Bronze-capped Teal (*Eunetta falcata*) in the Bazaar, a bird usually decidedly rare in India. It is possible, therefore, that these white-headed Ruffs are an Eastern strain, which, like the duck above-mentioned, only occasionally migrate in a westerly direction. It will be noticed also that during the years 1842-46 that Blyth procured his specimens, he also got the Clucking Teal (*Nettium formosum*) and Eastern White-eyed Pochard (*Nyroca baeri*), also eastern irregular visitants to our empire.\n\nAs out of so many specimens of this variety seen by me only three were females, we may conclude that the variation is largely limited to the male, Reeves here at all events being much more numerous than Ruffs. I have above shown that it only occurs in old birds, and thus I am inclined to look on it as a species of senile albinism analogous to what occurs in black varieties of the domestic fowl and duck. I have also seen an ageing green Canary turn largely yellow about the head.\n\nAt the same time, these white-marked individuals are not at all wanting in vigour; the two white-headed males at the Calcutta Zoological Gardens have survived while all the normally coloured Ruffs procured that winter (1900-01) have died, though kept under similar\nconditions; and one now, although crippled to a great extent in one wing, is master of most if not all the normally coloured Ruffs again placed with him in another aviary. Yet a Reeve, which was at first his sole companion of the species, seems to have deserted him for a normally coloured bird.\n\nThe only-slightly-mottled specimen alluded to above also, though undersized and slightly lame, often attacked and beat a larger, though younger, normally-coloured male confined with it, which was sound.\n\nIn conclusion, it seems to me, that whether the unusual number of this variety which have appeared of late is due to an abnormal westerly migration or not, it seems to be a well-marked and definable form, liable to recur again and again, and very probably hereditary; thus it would be likely to increase, unless checked by natural or sexual selection.\n\nThe Ruff could probably afford to run a greater risk than most birds, as it is evidently a vigorous species, more hardy of constitution, courageous, and indiscriminate in its diet than most Limicolae; this is shown by its readiness to eat vegetable as well as animal food, its habit of constantly fighting, in which both sexes indulge as well in winter as in summer, and its power of recovering from injuries and enduring so unnatural a climate as that of Bengal.\n\nAs it is desirable to distinguish a well-marked and recurrent aberration like this by a subspecific name, I venture to suggest that it be known as *Pavoncella pugnax leucoprora.*\n\nII. Note on the *Gallus pseudhermaphroditus* of Blyth.\n\nWith the attention that is now being paid to the variation of animals under domestication, it may not be mal \u00e0 propos to recall to the memory of naturalists the curious variety of the fowl described many years ago, though doubtfully, by Blyth, under the name of *Gallus pseudhermaphroditus*. The specimen is alluded to in his catalogue of the birds in the collection of the Asiatic Society under No. 1463 as \"P. Singular individual (?) variety, from Mergui, described as *G. pseudhermaphroditus*, J.A.S.X, 925. Rev. J. Barbe (1841).\"\n\nThe specimen still exists, and, unlike too many of Blyth's birds, has suffered little deterioration, and hence I have thought it advisable to give a figure of it here (Plate II), as I have never seen or heard of a similar variation myself. I also reproduce below the original description from page 925 of the tenth volume of our Society's Journal, since this is not very readily accessible now-a-days:\n\n---\n\n*Diagnosis\u2014Exemplis hibernis P. pugnacis similis, sed capite et nuch\u00e2 aut omnino albis aut albo variegatis distinguenda.*\n\"Gallus pseudhermaphroditus, Nobis, N.S.? \u2014\u2014 A very singular bird, which, if I was not positively assured, was a male in normal plumage, I should have suspected to be either an individual of mingled sex, or possibly an aged male; for that it is not a female in partially masculine attire is evident from the size of its comb and wattles, and especially of its spurs. Size of an English game cock, or larger than the male *G. Bankivus*, having much stouter legs, the spurs of which are $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inches long; comb and wattles as in the *G. Bankivus*, but the former more entire towards the front (possibly a mere individual diversity): the tail is that of a cock bird of this genus, but scarcely more developed than in the *Euplocomi* (as *Eu. albocristatus*); in other respects the plumage is altogether that of an ordinary brown hen, having a redder cast than in the female *G. Bankivus*, especially on the wings; tail coloured as in an ordinary male. Length about 2 feet, of which the middle tail feathers occupy 10 inches, wing from bend 9 inches, and tarse behind, to back toe, $2\\frac{3}{4}$ inches. I am informed that this species is never clad in the usual bright plumage of other male birds of its genus.\"\n\nThe specimen now only shows one long central tail-feather or \"sickle,\" the other having apparently been broken, since there is a large broken feather on the opposite side of the tail. From the look of the comb and the coarse legs with abnormally enlarged anterior scales, there can be little doubt that the bird was really a domestic one; and if its peculiarities were as a matter of fact racial, it would seem that there has existed in the east, a breed of which the cocks bore more or less feminine plumage, comparable to the \"Henny\" game still existing in England; which, however, are altogether hen-feathered.\n\nI have never seen any hen-feathered cocks among the very variable domestic poultry which occupy the coops in the Calcutta Bazaar; and I should like here to draw attention to the fact that the operation of caponizing, so frequently performed in India, results in more finely-developed male plumage in the cockerels operated on, although their combs and wattles do not develop fully, but remain like those of hens.\nJOURNAL\nOF THE\nASIATIC SOCIETY OF BENGAL,\n\nVol. LXXI.

On a specimen of the Moorhen from Mauritius.\n\nIn Blyth\u2019s catalogue of the Birds in the Museum of the Asiatic Society, p. 286, one of the specimens of *Gallinula chloropus* is noted as follows:\u2014G. Var. ? From the Mauritius. Presented by Willis Earle, Esq.\n\nThis specimen is still in existence, but as it is in poor condition, having lost many feathers, and the remainder being loose in places, I have deemed it well to have it figured, as it presents certain points of interest which make its appearance worthy of record. (See Plate IV).\n\nBeing a stuffed specimen it is not easy to measure exactly with regard to length, but with a tape I make it out to be 1 ft. \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) inches from tip of bill to end of tail, a fair average length judging from the measurements given by Dr. Sharpe in the British Museum Catalogue of Birds. The wing, however, is only about 6'1 inches, and although its feathers are much abraded, it could never have been more than about 6\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inches long, whereas Dr. Sharpe gives 7'3 inches as the length of wing for a bird measuring only a foot and half an inch in length, i.e., about the size of this one. The tail of the Mauritius birds is 2'5 inches in length, whereas the British Museum specimen alluded to has the tail 2'9.\n\nThe most remarkable point about the present bird however is its powerful bill and feet. The beak, with frontal shield, measures 1'65 inches; in thickness, at the proximal end of the nostril, it is .45 of an inch, whereas the biggest-billed Old World bird in the Indian Museum\nCollection, a Kashmir specimen, has a bill and frontal shield of 1\u00b76 inches, with the depth of bill measured in the same place, of '4 only. The wing of this bird measures 6\u00b73.\n\nThe left shank of the Mauritius bird, measured from the upper end of the tarso-metatarsae to the setting-on of the front-toes, is 2\u00b72 inches, as against the 1\u00b78 of the Kashmir bird; but the thickness of the shank across the front, midway down its length, is '2 in the former as against '15 in the latter. I have not measured the shanks from front to back, so as to avoid any error from the insertion of wires into the legs of the Asiatic Society's specimen. The middle toe and claw of the Mauritius bird only exceed those of the Kashmir specimen by about '1 of an inch, so that in the insular specimen the toes have decreased in relative length. Another remarkable point about the Mauritius bird is that it has the frontal shield, which is very large, truncate behind even more markedly than in the American Gallinula galeata; that is to say, judging from our two specimens of the latter, which show so much variation in this character as to suggest that those authors who only allow the New World birds the rank of a subspecies are correct. The differences in the frontal shields will be easily be apparent from the full-sized figures given in Plate V. It will be seen that the Mauritius bird has as long a bill as the Lake St. Clair example of G. galeata, whose wing measures 7\u00b74 inches.\n\nTo sum up, the present specimen of G. chloropus from Mauritius, when compared with normal specimens, exhibits an increase of the size of the bill and feet, and a shortening of the wings, tail, and toes, which show that it has progressed some way in the direction of the flightless forms of Gallinula separated in the British Museum Catalogue as Porphyriornis. In colouration it does not differ from G. chloropus; it is true that the under-tail coverts are cream-colour instead of white, but this is probably due to the age of the specimen. Professor A. Newton's G. pyrrhorhoa, described from Mauritius, has these ochreous under-tail-coverts; but the tinge has been shown by Dr. R. B. Sharpe (Cat. Birds, B.M., Vol. XIII, p. 173), to exist in English specimens, and one in the Indian Museum collected by Colonel C. T. Bingham in the Shan States also exhibits it. Another character given by Professor Newton is the yellowness of the legs of G. pyrrhorhoa; but from an old specimen like the present one it is quite impossible now to say of what colour the legs originally were.\n\nIt seems to me, therefore, that the Moorhens of Mauritius need re-examination; if they normally present the stoutness of build and brevity of wing and tail characteristic of the present specimen, they certainly constitute a recognizable race, which might well bear the name\nbestowed by Professor Newton, since that ornithologist expressly mentions a large frontal shield as one of the characteristics of *G. pyrrhorhoa*.\n\nII. **On two specimens of a Tropic-bird from Mauritius.**\n\nIn Blyth's Catalogue, under the number 1736, we find the entry, \"A.B., Adults, from the Mauritius. Willis Earle, Esq.,\" in reference to two specimens of a Tropic-bird which he there designates *Ph. candidus*. This is the *P. lepturus* of the British Museum Catalogue, Vol. XXVI, p. 454.\n\nI find, however, that while specimen A of Blyth's Catalogue agrees with the British Museum Catalogue description in most particulars, specimen B is distinct, and resembles *Pha\u00ebthon americanus* in having shorter white tips to the first four primaries, and in having the outer web of the fifth entirely black to within a short distance of the extremity. Both birds also have evidently had the bill almost entirely yellow, unlike that of *P. lepturus* as described. *(See figures below).*\nExcept for this bill and for the slightly shorter white tips to the quills, 1736A is true *P. lepturus*, which, from the British Museum Catalogue list of specimens, occurs at Mauritius, and it may therefore, I think, be referred to that species, although not entirely agreeing therewith.\n\nThe other specimen, B, however, is not so nearly in agreement with *P. americanus*, for while it has a nearly completely yellow bill, the white tips of the first four primaries are never so little as half an inch long, and the third quill is not nearly all black, but marked like the rest, although the fifth has a good deal of black along the outer web as in *P. americanus*.\n\nThus these two specimens do not agree with the description of any species of *Pha\u00ebthon*; and yet they differ far too much from each other to be referred to a separate form. I am therefore disposed to think that they are both *Pha\u00ebthon lepturus*; and this must be a variable species, since it can produce, in the Old World, one individual showing a considerable approximation to the American *P. americanus*, in the\ncolouration of the bill and quills; and another which approaches the American form in the colouration of the bill only. It is, of course, just conceivable that a specimen of *P. americanus* strayed at one time to Mauritius and interbred with the local birds; but the distribution of the form renders this unlikely, and I should be rather inclined to put down the peculiarities of these birds to simple variation.\n\nVII.\u2014On hybrids between the Guinea-fowl and Common fowl.\u2014By F. Finn, B.A., F.Z.S., Deputy Superintendent of the Indian Museum.\n\n[Received March 26th; Read April 2nd, 1902.]\n\nA good account of this cross, which is not by any means common, has been given by Dr. Juan Vilaro, in the Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History, Vol. IX. (1897), p. 225.\n\nThe hybrid, as represented in the plates accompanying Dr. Vilaro's papers has a very characteristic appearance, its general form and carriage being intermediate between the Fowl and Guinea-fowl, and its head devoid of the comb and gular wattles of the one and rictal wattles and casque of the other. I was thus easily enabled to recognize as Guinea-fowl hybrids three curious fowls received by the Calcutta Zoological Garden from Mr. A. T. Blewitt, of Kalka, early in 1899.\n\nThey had been caught in a wild state, but this is not surprising as the tame-bred hybrid between the domestic Muscovy Duck and Common Duck is known to become feral at times.\n\nThese birds all resembled Common fowls in colour, the largest being splashed with white and red-brown, and the other two (one of which is figured on Plate VI) being red-brown with black necks and fine black pencilling on many of the feathers. The characteristic spotting of the Guinea-fowl was altogether absent. All had bare flesh-coloured faces, and a pendulous dewlap, most marked in the large white-spotted specimen. There was no comb, although a bare median area at the base of the bill above seemed to indicate a rudiment; and the rictal wattles of the Guinea-fowl were just indicated at the gape; of the horn of the Guinea-fowl and gular wattles of the fowl there was no trace at all. The specimen figured was a male, the testes being about the size of haricot beans; of the others, which have also died and been transferred to the Museum, the brown specimen has been preserved entire in spirits, and the other made into a skeleton. The taxidermist who prepared it states that it was a female, which I should certainly not have suspected from seeing the three birds alive. All were larger than a Guinea-fowl or ordinary Indian fowl, and had particularly strong\nbills and legs, the latter of a black colour. Their behaviour was quiet; but they were never placed with other birds, so I do not know how they would have treated these. Like Dr. Vilaro's specimens, they seemed to be very sensible to heat, panting more than other birds, and their only cry was a piping, chirping sound, very different from the harsh note of the birds which came under Dr. Vilaro's observation.\n\nVIII.\u2014Notes on Animals kept in the Alipore Zoological Garden. No. I.\u2014\nBy Rai K. B. Sanyal Bahadur, Superintendent of the Garden.\n\n[Received March 26th; Read April 2nd, 1902.]\n\nObservations on the habits of Orang Outang in captivity.\n\nOrang Outang thinks and acts with a view to accomplishing an object. An Orang Outang and a Proboscis Monkey (Semnopithecus [Nasalis] larvatus), lived in two contiguous cages separated by iron gratings. Although of different temperaments\u2014the Orang Outang lively, vivacious and prone to mischief, and the monkey phlegmatic and indolent\u2014they were best of friends; and enjoyed each other's company as much as the intervening partition would allow. The Orang's friendship for the monkey was, however, not altogether disinterested. They were usually fed about the same time upon the same kind of food, and as the Orang Outang was blessed with a keen appetite, he had no scruple to help himself, to as much of his friend's share as chance brought within his reach. One morning he was found making desperate attempts to annex the remnants of the monkey's breakfast by repeatedly thrusting his arms through the gratings. But all his tricks and trouble availed him not, as the light tin vessel containing the tempting morsel lay beyond the reach of his long arms. Having failed in his attempt to get at the food, he sat still for a few seconds as if to collect his thoughts, and to devise means for the accomplishment of his object, and presently made a rush into his sleeping apartment, fetched a quantity of straw, and twisted it into a sort of rough rope, and with it began striking the tin vessel containing the food, and ultimately succeeded in bringing it within the reach of his arms.\n\nOrang Outang imitating human action. It is well known that in their wild state Orang Outangs indulge in the habit of building platforms of twigs and branches on large trees. Given opportunities they would do the same in captivity also.\n\nThe Orang Outang whose habits are here chronicled, was a remarkably docile animal, and was, therefore, allowed to enjoy as much free-\ndom as it was deemed safe. The first use that he made of his liberty was to build himself a platform on one of the trees that stood close to his habitation. One cloudy August morning, while seated on his arboreal perch, he noticed some early visitors open out their umbrellas to protect themselves from a passing shower of rain, and straightway he broke off a leafy branch and held it umbrella-fashion over his own head in imitation of the human folks!\n\nIt was amusing to see him following visitors who happened to have anything tied in their cloth, or who carried a bundle on their head. Quick to observe, he had noticed some of them untying a bundle to give him a feed, and by a simple process of ratiocination he came to connect all bundles with food and feeding!\n\nPHYSIOLOGICAL ECONOMY OF ANIMALS AFFECTED BY ACCIDENTS.\n\nA Large White Egret (Herodias alba) having lived happily in the Garden for many years managed to break one of its legs by sustaining a fracture of its left tarsus. The fracture was set up and the wound healed nicely, but the shock of the accident must have materially affected the physiological economy of the bird's system; as during the next two years it did not assume the full breeding plumage, or the bright green of the facial skin which it usually did in summer and which was such a characteristic feature of the bird. Although in about three years after the accident it began putting on the summer dress again, there was a marked deterioration in the character of the plumes and the colour of the facial skin. This might have been due to old age also.\n\nIX.\u2014On the Variation of the Flower of Ranunculus arvensis.\u2014By I. H. Burkill, M.A.\n\nThere is a regular sequence of organs in the Phanerogamic flower,\u2014sepals, petals, stamens, carpels,\u2014which is never departed from, and which may be said to be due to the passing of moods over the axis,\u2014a mood for the formation of sepals, a mood for the formation of petals, a mood for the formation of stamens, and a mood for the formation of carpels. Each mood is preclusive in its time of the others and definite; and the flower axis runs through them as a matter of course.\n\nIn the flower, mood follows mood very closely; yet the tendency so widely manifest, for the floral organs to be formed in whorls is a separating of the moods each from its neighbours by concentrating on itself.\nThe symmetry of the flower depends firstly on this regular sequence and separation of the moods; it depends secondly on the way in which successive rings of organs,\u2014sepals, petals, etc.\u2014are commonly isomerous.\n\nI have been driven to a conviction that the separation of these moods has not yet obtained the attention it deserves. We need to know much about them; chiefly as to the conditions which lead to their separation: for the whole Phanerogamic subkingdom shows us that the more specialised a flower is the more distinctly are its moods separated; and the isolation of the moods is undeniably of far-reaching importance in the growth of perfect floral symmetry.\n\nIt may be said that there are questions of four kinds to be asked regarding the moods, (i) why the moods exist, (ii) as to the reason of their sequence, (iii) as to the requirements which have made them as distinct as they are, and (iv) as to the causes leading to a determination of the number of lateral organs which belong to each of them severally.\n\nThey are questions in organography, as Goebel terms the causative morphology of the new school, in order to distinguish it from the descriptive morphology which is subservient to the systematist. The foundation of organography is in the Darwinian theory of evolution.\n\nThe present paper concerns questions of the fourth kind; but in preface I wish to make some brief remarks regarding the second and the third kind of question. Regarding the second: the sepals are formed outermost to protect; the petals are formed second to attract; and we have these reasons for the position of both; but why the mood for the formation of stamens should invariably precede that for the formation of carpels is a question which must remain a subject for speculation almost as long as the origin of the Phanerogams is unsolved. This only can be said, that somehow the formation of female organs puts a period to the forward growth of the axis, whereas the forming stamens have divided with the axis the available nutrition passing beyond the growing sepals and petals. -This perhaps means some advantage in the matter of food to one or the other. I do not say which: but it is to be confessed that there are strong reasons for assuming that, in nature generally, conditions of good nourishment tend more to the formation of female than of male organs: for experiments on the lower plants\u2014Alg\u00e6, Fungi and Vascular Cryptogams\u2014have shown that there is a tendency for female reproductive organs to be formed when the plants are well nourished, male organs when they are starved: and extensive observations on animals indicate the same thing. A condition so widely true may well be true also of the Phanerogams; but at the present time can we produce any convincing evidence that the developing bud\ngets better nourished as it progresses from the formation of sterile protective or showy organs, through male organs to female organs, or that the female organs appropriate two shares of nutriment because there is by them that which might belong to an elongating axis?\n\nRegarding the third kind of question, let it be remarked that intermediate organs are apt to be useless organs and that therefore we see one reason for the distinctness of the moods; secondly, it is to be stated that if we let ourselves believe that sepals, petals, stamens and carpels are formed under conditions of nutrition which change as the axis gives rise to them, we still cannot easily assume that the conditions of nourishment change as abruptly as do the moods.\n\nLastly, with regard to the fourth kind of question we are bound to suppose that a certain relationship between the number of the stamens and carpels exists which is at least not prejudicial to the maintenance of the race; i.e., that enough stamens must be produced to enable a sufficiency of seed to be set by the carpels; and it is reasonable to believe that the petals and the sepals are required by their biological functions to bear a more or less definite proportion to the organs they protect or make conspicuous: but it will be acknowledged that this supposition implies a force too loose in its action to produce isomerism as we see it, too loose to regulate the not uncommon orderly change of a normally tetramerous flower to pentamerism, or of a normally pentamerous flower to hexamerism, and impossible to accept as the sole factor when we glance at the general absence of intermediate conditions between isostemony and diplostemony. The view to which Schwendener's and Karl Schumann's work leads, can carry us a step beyond this supposition; for, as they have shown, we have strong reasons for believing that the symmetry of a flower is largely influenced by the mutual pressure in the bud of part on part, and that this pressure to a considerable degree compels new organs to appear in the niches between those recently formed. Thus do the sepals\u2014the outermost members of the flower\u2014as it were set the step and, e.g., if they are in rings of five (I use the word ring because I require a term less definite than whorl) the petals and stamens frequently follow in fives.\n\nThe carpels too may follow the step, but their position is unique in that the axis is no longer growing forward when they form and new conditions of pressure, as perhaps of nutrition, are possibly existing.\n\nThe individual and the race are always in slight antagonism: the race asks for reproduction, and some writers such as Axell have thought that they could see in the flower the most perfect adaptation or subservience to reproduction. But our flower, above conceived,\nasserts the individual distinctly if we allow the possible formation of sexual organs by order according to nutrition available, and the fixing of the number by the need of packing. I shall show later, at least in *Ranunculus arvensis*, another assertion of the individual\u2014a setting aside of the claims of the race by allowing a kind of right of primogeniture to the moods in the flower. This right of primogeniture is the more interesting when we consider it in connection with the view that sepals and petals are sterilised stamens; for it gives preference to the mood which by origin is then supposed secondary.\n\nThe above remarks are to be taken as embodying some notion of the foundations of the Phanerogamic flower. Working upon them we may make a study of a particular species of plant in order to seek how far the fixed and definite relationships of the organs in number to one another, which we can observe in most Phanerogams, may be due to the compelling influence of pressure in the bud acting inwards from the outermost organs (sepals), or to the way in which nutrition becomes available in the developing axis, or to nutrition and the influence of pressure combined, or to the attempt of the plant to produce an effective and economical assemblage of reproductive members. I have proposed to approach the question by comparing the variation in adjacent sets of floral organs, and seeing how far in different types of flower any one set is free to deviate from pattern.\n\nThere are flowers where the jointing of set on set may be considered to be loose, where adjacent rings of organs are not isomerous and such flowers seemed best for my purpose. One such is *Parnassia palustris* where a 4-merous ovary tops an otherwise 5-merous flower; another is the garden Gloxinia where 2 carpels top a similarly 5-merous (potentially in stamens) flower. It is to be asked if, as a rule, variation from normal is more easily accomplished on the upper side of the badly fitting joint than elsewhere. If so, then the inference is obvious that pressure is playing a large part in keeping to type the moods of that flower which are well jointed.\n\nThis I found to be the case with *Parnassia palustris*. In 1894 and 1895 I examined over 5,000 flowers and I recorded my observations in the Journal of Botany, 1896, pp. 12\u201315.\n\nI had approximately 5,152 flowers normal in the number of sepals and in only two of them did the petals, stamens and staminodes fail to keep true to symmetry; but the carpels diverged from the normal four in 450 cases. I had 36 flowers abnormal in the number of sepals, 15 with only four, 21 with six, and in all but three of those flowers petals, stamens and staminodes followed the lead and varied with the sepals; but in them eleven flowers had three carpels, nine had the usual\nfour, fourteen had five and two had six. So much for the free variation above the badly fitting line in Parnassia. In the garden Gloxinia on which I have made, when at Kew, some unpublished observations, it is the same. Gardeners have selected and raised beautiful races with more than the normal number of petals; the selection was never for the sepals or stamens, but these two sets of organs have varied hand in hand with the petals while the ovary which normally has two carpels hesitates in the improved race between two and three.\n\nA table which I gave in my note on Parnassia shewed that when the sepals were 4, the carpels were generally 3; and when the sepals were 6, the carpels were generally 5. Herein we see a correlative increase or decrease in both. Now it is easier by $\\frac{1}{30}$ of the unit to squeeze five than to expand three into the space of four and it happened in Parnassia, as I showed in a table on page 13 of the Journal, that five carpels were more common in 6-merous than three in the 4-merous flowers,\u2014an observation in accord with ideas of pressure but of a ring on a confined area; and not of organs compelling others to fall into the niches between them. Towards satisfying myself in this matter, I devised a little machine for measuring divergences and succeeded in demonstrating (see Annals of Botany, XV, 1901, pp. 187-192) that, at least when near fruit-ripening, the carpels in Parnassia have no very exact relationship in position to the sepals.\n\nAfter examining Parnassia I sought for a flower with worse fitting joints or better with no joints at all and took Ranunculus arvensis for my purpose.\n\nRanunculus arvensis is a little cornfield weed of Europe and Temperate Asia, an annual and easily grown. It is very variable in the flower and in all parts of it; it has not got that concentration of the moods for the formation of the various floral organs which occurs in all regularly whorled flowers, its moods for the formation of petals and stamens being particularly ill-defined. These irregularities seemed to me qualifications suiting it particularly to my purpose. The sepals are commonly 5 with a divergence of $\\frac{2}{5}$, the petals are 5 or fewer alternating with the sepals and repeating their divergence; but the stamens and carpels have a completely different arrangement; the former are very variable in number and the latter generally 4\u20137.\n\nI grew my plants in 1895 in the University Botanic Garden, Cambridge, from seed which had ripened in the Botanic Gardens of Bonn and Hiedelberg, Paris, Stockholm and Bordeaux, and in 1898 in a window box at Kew from seed which had ripened in the years 1896 and 1897 in the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. I made a point of examining every flower produced, counting and recording the\nnumber of its sepals, petals, stamens and carpels, and noting any obvious abnormalities in it. For the purpose the flowers were picked when just open, and this picking, done daily, caused the plants to continue long in blossom.\n\nIn this way I examined in 1895, 1,383 flowers from Heidelberg seed and 1,203 from Bonn seed; in 1898, 2,298 from Kew 1896 seed (157 plants) and 1,589 from Kew 1897 seed (73 plants); and also in 1895 lesser numbers of flowers from Paris, Stockholm, and Bordeaux seed\u2014numbers too small to be of real service. I give the results of the examination of the Paris, Stockholm and Bordeaux plants here before proceeding. I shall not mention them again.\n\n|                | No. of flowers | Average No. of Sepals | Average No. of Petals | Average No. of Stamens | Average No. of Carpels |\n|----------------|---------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Stockholm      | 135           | 4\u00b794                  | 4\u00b749                  | 8\u00b727                   | 5\u00b787                  |\n| Paris          | 382           | 4\u00b791                  | 3\u00b750                  | 5\u00b750                   | 5\u00b725                  |\n| Bordeaux       | 167           | 4\u00b795                  | 4\u00b710                  | 6\u00b774                   | 5\u00b737                  |\n\nAs to the more profitable experiments I found the different sowings to vary as follows:\n\n**Table I.\u2014Variation in Sepals.**\n\n| No. of Sepals | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |\n|--------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Heidelberg   |   |   |   | 1 | 85| 1,287| 8 | 1 | 0 | 1 |\n| Bonn         |   |   |   | 1 | 0 | 9 | 69 | 1,121| 2 | 0 | 1 |\n| Kew, Old     |   |   |   | 2 | 13| 63 | 2,217| 3 |   |   |\n| Kew, New     |   |   |   | 1 | 3 | 4 | 18 | 1,516| 1 |   |   |\n\n**Table II.\u2014Variation in Petals.**\n\n| No. of Petals | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |\n|--------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Heidelberg   |   |   |   | 5 | 126| 486| 417| 345| 3 | 1 |\n| Bonn         |   |   |   | 4 | 82 | 349| 438| 327| 1 | 1 |\n| Kew, Old     |   |   |   | 2 | 26 | 237| 430| 1592| 9 |   |\n| Kew, New     |   |   |   | 3 | 2 | 19 | 182| 289| 1091| 3 |   |\nTable III.\u2014Variation in Stamens.\n\n| No. of Stamens | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 |\n|---------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|\n| Heidelberg    |   | 1 | 2 | 1 | 6 | 5 | 1 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 8  | 4  | 3  | 3  | 1  | 1  |   |   |   |\n| Bonn          |   | 1 | 4 | 9 | 2 | 1 | 5 | 1 | 4 | 2 | 4  | 2  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  |   |   |   |\n| Kew, Old      |   | 1 | 5 | 6 | 2 | 2 | 9 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 4  | 2 | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  |   |   |   |\n| Kew, New      |   | 3 | 6 | 3 | 0 | 1 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 9 | 2 | 6 | 4 | 1  | 1  | 1  |   |   |   |\n\nTable IV.\u2014Variation in Carpels.\n\n| No. of Carpels | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 |\n|---------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|\n| Heidelberg    | 3 | 3 | 1 | 3 | 9 | 5 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  |   |   |   |\n| Bonn          | 5 | 1 | 0 | 4 | 3 | 5 | 1 | 5 | 4 | 2 | 2  | 2  | 2  | 2  | 2  | 2  |   |   |   |\n| Kew, Old      | 3 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 7 | 5 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 2  | 2  | 2  | 2  | 2  | 2  |   |   |   |\n| Kew, New      | 1 | 2 | 1 | 6 | 6 | 8 | 1 | 9 | 8 | 3 | 3  | 3  | 3  | 3  | 3  | 3  |   |   |   |\n\nThere is an obvious difference between the two German races and the Kew race and some difference between the Kew plants from 1896 seed and those from 1897 seed although they belonged to the same stock. The variation curves which may be plotted from these figures are irregular, and those for no one set of organs exactly correspond with those for neighbouring sets: the curves of the sepals are half-Galton curves; and the curves of the petals in the Kew race are also half-Galton curves, but not quite as those for the sepals; while the curves of the petals in the German races are intermediate between half-Galton and symmetric Quetelet binomial curves: the curves for the stamens are equally asymmetric, but in a different way; while the curves for the carpels are the most nearly bi-symmetric of all but are not quite so. It is evident from a comparison of them that the flower does not vary as an unit as for instance a Tulip flower may, every ring of organs changing from 3-merism to 4-merism; but each mood varies in its own manner. We shall learn more of this independence of the moods in variation by studying their association. I cannot give tables of the combinations observed in the different races for all the four sets of organs taken two together, without occupying a great amount of space; I therefore give tables for the \"Kew Old\" plants alone. They will serve as an illustration for all, as the tables which could be given for the German races and \"Kew New\" are not unlike them.\nTable V.\u2014Kew, Old\u2014Correlation of Sepals and

calculated are as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccccccccccccccc}\n3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 & 18 \\\\\n1 & 3 & 6 & 10 & 15 & 21 & 28 & 36 & 36 & 28 & 21 & 15 & 10 & 6 & 3 & 1\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nIf we take another three dice of distinguishing colour absolutely symmetrical, and throwing them with the others record the association of numbers, the resulting table will be as symmetric as the binomial curve just given, but in two dimensions, and out of 14,400 throws there is one chance of \\(3+3\\) being the score of the two sets of dice and one of \\(18+18\\), one of \\(3+18\\) and one of \\(18+3\\); there are three chances of the score being \\(4+3\\), and three of its being \\(17+3\\), i.e., equal chances as far as the extremes are concerned of there being a close similarity between the figures and a wide dissimilarity. A glance at the tables just given will satisfy that this is not the case in them and that the tendency to similarity is evident; that in the mutual relationship of mood to mood the adjustment is not a question of chance but, as is indicated by the averages in the last column and lowest line of each table, is due to some loosely coercing force which will be discussed.\n\nAs I have foregone the publishing of tables to give for the Kew New plants and the Bonn and Heidelberg races my exact observations on adjustment of moods, I place below the averages found omitting those derived from fewer flowers than ten.\n\nI will briefly call attention to the chief points in the averages. Table XI shows that fewer sepals mean fewer of all other organs and it is to be noted that the reduction is greatest in the organs furthest away from the sepals. Table XII shows for the Kew race a considerable reduction of both stamens and carpels when the petals are reduced; it shows for the German races a much slighter reduction of carpels and an insignificant reduction of stamens. It shows further that reduction in the number of petals does not act as a reflex on the number of sepals in anything like the way in which reduction of sepals may be said to promote reduction of petals. Table XIII shows that with a reduction or increase of stamens the reduction or increase of the carpels is much greater than the reduction or increase of the organs which preceded them. Table XIV shows that reduction or increase of carpels is accompanied by a more nearly corresponding reduction or increase in the organs closest to them. Consequently, admitting that there is an exception in the relation of petals to stamens in the German races, we may broadly state that the influence producing correlative increase or decrease chiefly acts forwards from the preceding mood to the moods which follow and that correlative increase and decrease is closest in neighbouring moods.\n\nJ. ii. 14\nTable XI.\u2014Average No. of other organs in

petal less, two stamens less and \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) carpel less; when two sepals are wanting then we lose further \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) petal, \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) stamen and \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) carpel.\n\nIn the German races one sepal less than the complete five means roughly \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\) petal less, \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) stamen and \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) carpel; when two sepals are wanting we lose a further \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) petal, \\( 3\\frac{1}{2} \\) stamens, \\( 2\\frac{1}{2} \\) carpels; i.e., in the German races 4 sepaled flowers are more nearly otherwise normal than in the Kew race: and what is true for the sepals is true for the petals, i.e., that the first reduction in them from normal is much more closely accompanied by a reduction in other organs than is the case in the two German races.\n\nApportionment of organs in the Kew race.\u2014The least flower of the Kew race had 8 organs in all, the largest 36. The largest flowers were richest in stamens, the least richest in sepals. I give in table XV the average number of sepals, petals, stamens and carpels in flowers with varying numbers of total organs, and over leaf are curves expressing the result graphically. The result may be briefly stated thus:\u2014if there is power to produce more than 15 organs the sepals claim their full compliment; if there is power to produce more than 20 organs, the petals also claim their full compliment; if there is power to produce more than 28 organs the carpels begin to show signs of\nGraphic representation of the apportionment of sepals, petals, stamens and carpels in flowers of *Ranunculus arvensis* (Kew race) with the number of organs varying from 13 to 33.\nsatiety; extra power beyond this goes chiefly to the stamens. At 20 the flower is not far from having the formula K5 C5 A5 G5, i.e., from being regularly 5-merous. The staminal curve shows slight irregularities at 15 and 18 the curves for petals and carpels practically touch at 15. The correspondence in the two sets of curves is most interesting.\n\nTable XV.\u2014Apportionment in flowers of the Kew race with the number of total organs varying from 8 to 36.\n\n| No. of organs |

As in the Kew race so here, in poor flowers the sepals are most numerous and in rich flowers the stamens are most numerous. But in these German races the petals do not claim their full number until the flower is rich enough to have 29 or 30 organs and on the part of the carpels no tendency to be satisfied can be detected.\nMathematical expression of the curves in formul\u00e6 seems to be by no means impossible although they are complicated.\n\nThere is no fiat which says \"this will be a flower of Ranunculus arvensis, the organs may vary in number a little from the ideal.\" But the fiat says \"this will be a flower and must run throughout all its moods. So long as all are present let them jostle for their compliment.\" So they jostle and the older win as far as they may by being already established at the time when the younger begin to compete; the sepals take what they want only being forbidden from getting the whole five when that would leave too little for the other moods; and the petals following claim their portion in the same way but a little less strongly. There is left a residue for the stamens and carpels, and the larger it is, the more organs do the moods of both sets, but especially the stamens, obtain.\n\nNutrition.\u2014If seeding be prevented, Ranunculus arvensis dies flowering in utter depletion. Therefore I could get from this little proletarian flowers formed under the best conditions and under the worst possible conditions of nutrition, and so seek the effect of starvation on the moods spoken of. My earlier paper (Journ. Linn. Soc., Botany, Vol. XXXI, p. 235) contained a note on this plant to show that in it, as in several other plants, the first formed flowers are richest in stamens and carpels; I can now give fuller statistics, and shall show distinctly that the flower is pauperised with the ageing of the plant. I have divided the flowering period of the plants grown in 1895 into three periods and of those grown in 1898 into four periods. The decrease with age in the number of parts in the flower is shown by the following averages:\n\n| Table XVII.\u2014Kew, Old.

The following table shows this excess of masculinity, which occurs at the beginning of the flowering period and is soon done away with after flowering has commenced.\n\nTable XXV.\u2014The percentage which the Stamens (fertile and infertile) make out the total of organs in the flowers, at different periods; periods as before.\n\n|                | First period | 2nd period | 3rd period | last period |\n|----------------|--------------|------------|------------|-------------|\n| **Kew, Old**   | 68\u00b752        | 56\u00b768      | 53\u00b789      | 54\u00b729       |\n| **Kew, New**   | 61\u00b716        | 54\u00b798      | 51\u00b768      | 53\u00b777       |\n| **Bonn**       | 60\u00b768        | 58\u00b711      |            | 53\u00b776       |\n| **Heidelberg** | 61\u00b713        | 60\u00b793      |            | 58\u00b755       |\nIt is impossible to dissociate the lack of nutrition felt, it must be believed, by the flowers of the worn out plants and the right of primogeniture spoken of. The power to satisfy the sepaline mood and the petaline mood and to form abundant stamens and carpels is in the nutrition of the flower.\n\nOn page 110, it was said that the moods jostle for their compliment of organs and that the older win by being already established when the younger begin to compete. There is a reservation to make in regard to this statement, to demonstrate which table XV has been recast in table XXVI. The latter table shows that in well and fairly well fed flowers\u2014say with 20 organs and more\u2014the proportion falling to the carpellary mood is nearly constant, and that, as already made more or less evident, the staminal mood is residuary legatee for the extra vigour. Therefore for the richer flowers the vigour may be said to be roughly apportioned between on the one hand the sepaline, petaline and staminal moods which three jostle each other, and on the other hand the carpellary mood. In flowers poorer in organs than 20, the carpellary mood seems less prepared for and is subject in like degree to the staminal mood to the jostling for space.\n\nThus do the richer flowers appear more pre-apportioned than the poorer ones and therefore more knit together into an unit in the direction in which the flowers of most Phanerogams are knit together. We may easily believe that, given a flower with its moods so knit together that they vary together, the force of pressure of organ on organ in the bud may finish the shaping of the whole.\n\nWe can see that the flowers of the Kew race are a little more knitted into an unit than those of the German races. Thus the petals and sepals are much more often equal in number, and (as is shown on p. 103) when we get a flower of the Kew race departing in the sepals from normal by losing one, then the other organs are more likely to lose in proportion than in the German races. In short there is more see-sawing of mood on mood in the German races than in the Kew race.\n\nHowever there are irregularities in the curves with which I have been dealing which cannot clearly be attributed to the struggling of the moods for satiety and their relative advantages from primogeniture. These are made obvious in the recast table XV which we now have in XXVI.\n\nThe chief irregularities of the Kew race are:\n\n(i)\u2014Between 15 and 20 the stamens are above what would seem reasonable, rather more so at 15, 16, 18 and 19 than at 17 and 20.\n(ii)\u2014At 23 the stamens are a little above what would seem reasonable, the carpels below.\n\nI do not intend to attempt any explanation of these facts, but I must observe that if we cut out of our figures all flowers which have both their sepals and their petals other than five in number, the irregularities just noted almost disappear: and they do not disappear if we cut out only those flowers with sepals other than five: and this indicates that between 15 and 20 the stamens are able to add to their number from the petals. This is done in table XXVII.\n\nTable XXVI.\u2014Percentages of organs in the Kew race falling to the different moods in flowers of various numbers of parts.\n\n| No. of Organs | KEW, OLD. | KEW, NEW.

about from this tendency of stamens to gain below 20 in percentage at the expense of the petals, and from the tendency of the carpels above 20 to show satiety, that the excess of stamens over carpels is likely to be least at 20 and greater both above and below that number. Thus is the sex-proportion continually shifting along our curves.\n\nHalf staminodal petals were found in flowers of the Kew race as follows; it will be noticed that towards the end of the flowering period they appeared but one at a time in the flowers.\n\nTable XXVIII.\u2014Half Staminodal petals.\n\n|                | Period 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |\n|----------------|----------|---|---|---|\n| **Kew, Old**   |          |   |   |   |\n| Number         | 7        | 30| 20| 19|\n| In flowers     | 3        | 23| 18| 19|\n| Percentage     | .47      | .76| .79| .75|\n| **Kew, New**   |          |   |   |   |\n| Number         | 9        | 16| 11| 14|\n| In flowers     | 5        | .63| 11| 14|\n| Percentage     | .72      | .63| .61| .85|\n\nLastly I have an abnormality to notice; it consists of a lobing of the petals, one lobe being larger than the other. I found this abnormality in the Kew race to be fairly frequent and further I found it to be most abundant when the number of staminodes was highest.\n\nTable XXIX.\u2014Lobed petals.\n\n|                | Period 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |\n|----------------|----------|---|---|---|\n| **Kew, Old**   |          |   |   |   |\n| Number         | 10       | 30| 21| 19|\n| In flowers     | 2        | 17| 16| 9 |\n| Percentage     | .605     | .756| .839| .753|\n| **Kew, New**   |          |   |   |   |\n| Number         | 5        | 17| 13| 7 |\n| In flowers     | 3        | 16| 12| 6 |\n| Percentage     | .399     | .674| .721| .427|\nSummary.\n\nI have shown first of all (Tables I-IV) how the flowers of *Ranunculus arvensis* in the races studied, vary; and how each set of organs varies in a different way; so that the curves which may be plotted for sepals, for petals, for stamens, and for carpels are unlike, most of them neither perfect Quetelet-Galton nor perfect half Galton curves.\n\nI have shown secondly (Tables V-XIV) that a correlative increase and decrease occurs between the different sets of organs; so that when the stamens or any other set of organs depart from normal, it is probable that all other sets of organs will depart from normal, but chiefly those which follow. This is important as it indicates a division of vigour among the various sets, to be distinguished from an increase of the one at the expense of another.\n\nIn Tables XV-XVI and in the graphic representation of them on page 106 I have followed this up by showing how if we take the total number of organs in the flower as a measure of the vigour in the bud, we find that the ring of sepals, being the first-formed of the sets of organs, has the first pull on the vigour and is most likely to get a full complement, the ring of the petals being the next in order, is the next to be satisfied, and that stamens and carpels obtain the surplus the stamens chiefly so. I consider that the curves might with some little trouble be translated into formulae by a mathematician.\n\nIn Tables XVII-XX, I show that the power to produce organs diminishes as the plant grows weaker towards its death. Sometimes a slight recovery occurred at the very end: I do not feel justified in suggesting a cause for it. In Tables XXI and XXII, I show that sterility of the stameus increases towards the death of the plant.\n\nIn Tables XXIII-XXV, I show that the stamens\u2014the organs which profit chiefly as we have seen by the extreme of vigour\u2014lose by its loss; and consequently the flowers are most male when blossoming begins.\n\nIn Table XXVI, I have represented Table XV in a different way, so as to bring out sharply the division of vigour (*i.e.*, number of organs) between the different sets (moods). I can show by it that the flowers with more than 20 organs, there apparently is a setting aside *ab initio* of so much vigour for the carpellary mood, the staminal mood becoming residuary legatee; while in flowers with fewer than 20 organs the carpellary mood has to jostle with the preceding ones for its place. I show also by it and by the Table which follows it (XXVII), that there are certain irregularities which seem to be due to a borrowing of organs by the staminal set from the petals, which\nborrowing as may be noticed in Table XII, (see p. 102) probably is a more common occurrence in the German races than in the Kew race.\n\nThe last two Tables (Nos. XXVIII and XXIX) show the relative abundance of abnormal petals and staminodal petals at different times in the plants flowering.\n\nThe net result of the investigation is that we have in *Ranunculus arvensis* just a little of what (for want of a better term) may be called foresight in the formation of the flower. We find the flower completed however scanty the nutrition for it may be; and, when the nutrition is adequate, provision is, it seems, made in good time for the carpellary mood. The next problem will be to show how far in such a flower as that of Parnassia or of any Phanerogam, the constancy of the carpels is due to provision made for them when the bud first begins to be formed. Can the sepaline mood lead the carpellary by the nose, or is the carpellary not too important to the race to be without an assertiveness of its own?\n\nIt is interesting to observe that the staminal mood forms a sort of residuary legatee to the three early moods of the flower; interesting because we not uncommonly find that mood to disappear under conditions which have generally been ascribed to something disadvantageous to the plant (see Willis, On Gynodioecism, 3rd paper, *Proc. Cambridge Phil. Soc.*, viii., 1893, p. 129).\n\nWe have sought in passing for any indication in the flower which might suggest that pressure of organ on organ exercises an influence in shaping the flower; and we found that flowers of 20 organs did come near to having the formula $K_5C_5A_5G_5$; and in Table V we saw $K_4C_4$ and $K_3C_3$ to be commoner combinations than $K_4C_3$ or $K_3C_4$ (especially 5) and indeed any other number, and in Tables VI and VIII ten stamens to be commoner than nine or eleven in association with five sepals or with five petals. These observations do not suffice for building up any very definite statement.\n\nIt is equally advisable at present from these tabulations to make no statement regarding the possibility of female organs demanding per unit for their inception more nutriment than male organs.\n\nOne notices in regard to the variation of the flower of *Ranunculus arvensis* that it is always hungry, i.e., always capable to taking in more organs; the hungriest of its moods is that for the formation of stamens, next that for the formation of carpels, thirdly that for petals and least hungry that for sepals.\n\nJust as we find sepals to tend to be constant in number throughout our larger groups such as the Dicotyledons and Monocotyledons; petals to be constant in number in lesser groups; carpels to serve by their\nconstancy for the defining of orders, and stamens to be by number the least serviceable in the making of a classification of Phanerogams, so do we find sepals to have the greatest tendency to be constant in *Ranunculus arvensis*, petals next so, carpels in the third place and stamens last, *i.e.*, what we see in a broad view of the whole Phanerogamic Sub-Kingdom, we see again in the variation of the flower of this little weed.\n\nI had intended to deal with variation in *Nigella sativa* and *Delphinium Ajacis*, when writing on *Ranunculus arvensis* but my facts, are insufficient. They may, however, be said to be indicative of a reduction in number of all parts with age.

H. Wood, R.E., and F. Finn, B.A., F.Z.S., Deputy Superintendent of the Indian Museum.\n\n(With Plate VII.)\n\n[Received 30th April. Read 7th May, 1902.]\n\nIn the following paper Lieut. Wood is responsible for the general introduction and remarks on localities where the birds were collected; while the birds have been identified and annotated at the Indian Museum by the Deputy Superintendent. Almost all of the specimens have been generously presented to that institution by Lieut. Wood, and the accession is a particularly welcome one, as several rare species are represented, such as Trochalopterum erythrolaema.\n\nThe collection is also noteworthy as containing examples of two species new to the Indian fauna, P\u00e8re David's Babbler (Babax lanceolatus) and the Marsh Tit (Parus palustris). It has been deemed worth while to have these figured, on account of their interest from a distributional point of view. (See Plate VII).\n\nThe collection was made in that part of Burmah which is bounded on the west by the high range which divides the Pakokku and Minbu districts from the Chin Hills, and on the east by a parallel range which runs more or less due north and south, distant about 30 miles, and known locally under different names as the Pontaung\nNwamataung, Dudwataung, &c. Latitude $22^\\circ$ formed approximately the northern boundary and $20^\\circ15'$ the southern. A few specimens were however procured outside this tract while marching from Pakokku, the headquarters of the district of that name and situated on the River Irrawaddy.\n\nThe country within the boundaries described above is hilly, the average height of the eastern range being about 1,500 feet while some of the peaks are higher.\n\nFrom this range the country is broken up by a number of smaller ranges, each slightly lower till the foot of the western range is reached. Along the foot of the eastern slopes of this range there is nearly always a large river which breaks through the range and then turns immediately due north or south and flows in this direction for some distance till it finds a low place in the eastern range through which it can pass. The Maw, Man, Salin and Mon Rivers are all met in this way. The western range is much higher than those to the east. The average height being about 5,000 to 6,000 feet, while Mount Victoria (the highest peak in Burmah, 10,300 feet) is one of the peaks on the range within the limits. The country is heavily forested except in the valleys of the main streams, where rice is principally grown.\n\nPakokku, Long. $95^\\circ10'$, Lat. $21^\\circ18'$, height 300 feet. The headquarters of the district of that name. It is situated on the west bank of the Irrawaddy River and is in the dry zone of Upper Burmah. Outside the cultivation which surrounds the town, the country is covered with scrub jungle.\n\nKanhla, Long. $95^\\circ2'$, Lat. $21^\\circ17'$, height 400 feet. A small village on the Pakokku-Pauk Road; surrounding country scrub jungle.\n\nPauk, Long. $94^\\circ30'$, Lat. $21^\\circ29'$, height about 900 feet. A large village on the Pakokku-Tilin cart-road, situated just to the east of the first high range met with while marching west from the Irrawaddy River. The Yaw River flows about a mile to the east of the village. Outside the cultivation there is scrub jungle which gradually changes to forest as the hills are approached. It is on the west edge of the \"dry zone.\"\n\nKyin, Long. $94^\\circ18'$, Lat. $21^\\circ37'$, height about 2,000 feet. A small village on the Pauk-Tilin cart-road, situated to the westward of the first high range which is met with while marching westward from the Irrawaddy River. A small area of cultivation surrounds the village; beyond this is dense forest.\n\nTa-hnyin-taung, Long. $94^\\circ15'$, Lat. $21^\\circ37'$, height about 2,500 feet. A spur running westwards from the first high range met with while going west from the Irrawaddy. This high range is known locally\nunder a number of different names but it runs more or less along meridian of $94^\\circ20'$. It is covered with dense forest.\n\n*Tilin*, Long. $94^\\circ8'$, Lat. $20^\\circ13'$, height about 1,500 feet. A large village at the foot of the Chin Hills on the right bank of the Maw River. The cart-road to Gangaw from Pakokku passes through the village. Outside the cultivation the country is covered with dense jungle.\n\n*Man*, Long. $94^\\circ17'$, Lat. $21^\\circ18'$, height about 1,500 feet. A small village on the Pauk-Pasok cart-road, situated to the west of the first high range met with while going west from the Irrawaddy. The village is surrounded by dense jungle outside the small patch of cultivation.\n\n*Pontaung*, Long. $94^\\circ18'$, Lat. $21^\\circ20'$, height 1,900 feet. The first high range met with while going west from the Irrawaddy; on the lower slopes the forest is principally bamboo, which gradually changes into timber trees (teak, etc.), as the range rises in height.\n\n*Laungsh\u00e9*, Long. $94^\\circ10'$, Lat. $21^\\circ0'$, height about 1,000 feet. A large village situated at the foot of the Chin Hills just where the Salin River breaks through. A good deal of rice is cultivated in the valley and it was on the cultivation that most of the birds were shot here.\n\n*Kanpetlet*, Long. $94^\\circ0'$, Lat. $21^\\circ14'$, height 7,000 feet. At this place on the slopes of Mount Victoria the headquarters of the Pakokku Chin Hills are being built. It at present consists of two or three houses, while barracks for about 60 sepoys are being built. Mount Victoria, the summit of which is 10,300 feet, is the highest hill in Burmah and is the culminating point of the high range which runs from Manipur southwards more or less along the meridian of $94^\\circ$. A long spur emanates from the summit running in an easterly direction, and it is on this spur that Kanpetlet is situated. In the valleys the forest is very dense, while on the spurs there are large open spots covered with grass alternating with tracts of fairly open fir forest. Birds labelled Mount Victoria were shot on the way up to Kanpetlet from Saw, the village at the foot of the spur.\n\n*Dudawtaung*, Long. $94^\\circ18'$, Lat. $21^\\circ5'$, height about 2,000 feet. A range of hills about 2,000 feet high running north and south, the first high one that is met while marching west from the Irrawaddy River. It is covered with fairly dense forest.\n\n*Yinkwetaung*, Long. $93^\\circ58'$, Lat. $20^\\circ44'$, height 5,500 feet. The local name of one of the spurs which run eastward from the high range which forms the boundary between Pakokku district and the Chin Hills. Near the summit the spurs are bare of trees and covered with grass. In the valleys and on spurs below about 5,000 feet there is dense jungle.\nNwamataung, Long. 94\u00b018', Lat. 20\u00b04', height about 2,500 feet. A local name of the same range which to the north is known as Dudawtaung.\n\nSalin, Long. 94\u00b044', Lat. 20\u00b035', height 250 feet. A large village on the Salin River about 10 miles on the west of the Irrawaddy River. It is in the dry zone and outside the cultivation is scrub jungle.\n\nSid\u00f4ktaya, Long. 94\u00b015', Lat. 20\u00b025', height 2,000 feet. A large village situated at the foot of the Chin Hills on the bank of the river Mon. A large area of cultivation lies to the east of the village, while to the westward dense jungle comes very close.\n\nDalet Choung, Long. 94\u00b00', Lat. 20\u00b010', height 300 feet. A river which rises in the Arakan Yomas and flows due south reaching the sea between Akyab and Kyaukpyu. The surrounding hills are all densely covered with bamboo jungle.\n\nFamily Corvid\u00e6.\n\nUrocissa occipitalis. Red-billed Blue Magpie.\nTwo, Laungsh\u00e9, January 11th, 1902; one, Kyin Village, November 30th, 1901.\n\nDendrocitta rufa. Indian Tree-pie.\nOne, Laungsh\u00e9, January 12th, 1902; one, Man, December 25th, 1901.\n\nCrypsirhina cucullata. Hooded Racket-tailed Magpie.\nOne, Sid\u00f4ktaya, February 14th, 1902.\n\nGarrulus oatesi. Indo-Chinese Jay.\nOne, Kanpetlet, January 3rd, 1902.\n\nParus palustris. Marsh-Tit.\nOne, Kanpetlet, January 14th, 1902.\n\nThis specimen undoubtedly belongs to one of the races of P. palustris. The dimensions are rather large, the length being 4\u00b79 inches, wing 2\u00b75, tail 2\u00b71, bill from gape 4, and shank nearly 6. The colour above is olive grey, or drab; below a dirty drab-white. The cap and nape are glossy black, and the sides of head and neck pure white; the throat black with white tips to the feathers. The bill and feet are greyish black in the skin.\n\n[The specimen agrees perfectly with some Chinese specimens of P. palustris, recently procured by Captain Walton, I.M.S.]\n\nFamily Crateropodid\u00e6.\n\nGarrulax leucocephalus, Himalayan White-Crested Laughing-Thrush.\nTwo, Laungsh\u00e9, January 12th, 1902.\n\nGarrulax pectoralis. Black-gorgeted Laughing-Thrush.\nOne, Dudawtaung, December 26th, 1901; one, Laungsh\u00e9, January 11th, 1902. The latter has the under-surface buff throughout up to the chin. Both have the light tips to the tail-feathers pure white.\n\n**Garrulax moniliger.** *Necklaced Laughing-Thrush.*\n\nOne, Ta-hnyin-taung, December 10th, 1901.\n\nThe ear-coverts of this bird are entirely black; tips of tail pure white.\n\n**Babax lanceolatus.** *P\u00e8re David\u2019s Streaked Babbler.*\n\nOne, Kanpetlet, January 4th, 1902.\n\nAs this bird does not seem to be well known, I give a description of the specimen. Length about $11\\frac{1}{4}$ inches; wing $3\\cdot8$; tail $5$; bill from gape $1\\cdot1$; shank at front $1\\cdot2$.\n\nPlumage striated, with the exception of the visible parts of the wings and tail, which are plain olive, as also the upper tail-coverts. Centres of the feathers above blackish, shading into chestnut on each side, with the outsides edged on the neck with creamy white and on the back with olive. Lores, ear-coverts, and eye-brow, white slightly mixed with black; a strong black moustache running into a mottled black-and-white patch behind the ear-coverts. Under-surface creamy white streaked with black, the black streaks getting finer upwards and fading out on the throat, and becoming bordered with chestnut on the flanks; lower tail-coverts plain buff.\n\nFrom the descriptions and figures of David and Oustalet (Oiseaux de Chine) J. Verreaux (Nouv. Arch. du Museum, Bull. VII, 1871) and Dr. R. B. Sharpe (B.M. Cat. Birds, Vol. VII.), *Babax lanceolatus* would appear to have a uniformly chestnut head, the dorsal plumage edged with grey, not olive, and the ventral surface less striated than in our bird, in which also the tarsi seem considerably shorter.\n\nAt the same time, without specimens for comparison, I do not like to regard the present bird as deserving of specific distinction; if it be so I would propose the name of *Babax woodi* for it.\n\n**Trochalopterum erythrolema.** *Hume\u2019s Laughing-Thrush.*\n\nTwo, Yinkwetaung, January 19th, 1902; one, same locality, January 20th, 1902.\n\n**Trochalopterum virgatum.** *Manipur Striated Laughing-Thrush.*\n\nOne, Kanpetlet, January 3rd, 1902; one, Kanpetlet, January 4th, 1902.\n\n**Argya gularis.** *White-throated Babbler.*\n\nTwo, Pakokku, November 19th, 1901.\n\n**Myiophonus temminckii.** *Himalayan Whistling-Thrush.*\n\nOne, Yuikwetaung, January 27th, 1902.\n\n**Lioptila gracilis.** *Grey Sibia.*\nOne, Yinkw\u00e8taung, January 18th, 1902; two, January 27th, 1902; one without date or locality.\n\n**Aegithina tipha.** *Common Iora.*\n\nOne, Pakokku, November 21st, 1901; one, Pauk, November 27th, 1901; one no date or locality.\n\n**Chloropsis aurifrons.** *Gold-fronted Chloropsis.*\n\nOne, Ta-hnyin-taung, November 8th, 1901; one, same locality, December 2nd, 1901; one, same locality, December 10th; one, Man, December 14th; one, same locality, December 20th; one, same locality, December 24th; one, Dudawtaung, January 7th, 1902.\n\n**Chloropsis chlorocephala.** *Burmese Chloropsis.*\n\nOne, Ta-hnyin-taung, no date; one, same locality, December 3rd, 1901.\n\n**Hypsipetes psaroides.** *Himalayan Black Bulbul.*\n\nOne, Yiukw\u00e8taung, January 29th, 1902.\n\n**Hemixus maclellandi.** *Rufous-bellied Bulbul.*\n\nOne, Yinkw\u00e8taung, November 2nd, 1901; two, same locality, January 18th, 1902; one, same locality, January 19th; one, same locality, January 27th; one, same locality, no date available.\n\n**Alcurus striatus.** *Striated Green Bulbul.*\n\nOne, Yinkw\u00e8taung, January 20th, 1902.\n\n**Molpastes burmanicus.** *Burmese Red-crested Bulbul.*\n\nOne, Tilin, December 12th, 1901.\n\n**Xanthixus flavescens.** *Blyth\u2019s Bulbul.*\n\nOne Kanpetlet, January 4th, 1901.\n\n**Otocompsa flaviventris.** *Black-crested Yellow Bulbul.*\n\nOne, no data; one, Ta-hnyin-taung, December 3rd, 1901; one, same locality, December 6th.\n\n**Family Sittidae.**\n\n**Sitta himalayensis.** *White-tailed Nuthatch.*\n\nOne, Yinkw\u00e8taung, January 20th, 1902.\n\n**Sitta nagaensis.** *Austen\u2019s Nuthatch.*\n\nOne, Kanpetlet, January 4th, 1902.\n\n**Sitta frontalis.** *Velvet-fronted Blue Nuthatch.*\n\nTwo, Ta-hnyin-taung, December 7th, 1901; one, Man, December 25th.\n\n**Family Dicruridae.**\n\n**Dicrurus ater.** *Black Drongo.*\n\nOne, Pakokku, November 23rd, 1901; a decidedly small specimen.\n\n**Dicrurus cineraceus.** *Grey Drongo.*\nOne, Ta-hnyin-taung, December 8th, 1901.\n\n**Bhringa remifer.** Lesser Racket-tailed Drongo.\n\nOne, Ta-hnyin-taung, December 8th; one, same locality, December 10th.\n\n**Dissemurus paradiseus.** Larger Racket-tailed Drongo.\n\nOne, Ta-hnyin-taung, December 5th, 1901; one, no locality.\n\n---\n\n**Family Laniidae.**\n\n**Lanius collurioides.** Burmese Shrike.\n\nOne, Pakokku, November 19th, 1901; one, Yinkwetaung, February 2nd, 1902. The first specimen has the two outer pairs of tail-feathers white with black shafts, and the next pair white with a long black patch on the inner web, the rest being black tipped with white; the underparts are also very pale, creamy white in fact. The dimensions are also smaller than those given in the *Fauna of British India*, Vol. I, p. 463. The crown and nape are dark ashy, and the forehead and lores black. The second has the tail normally coloured, and pale fulvous underparts.\n\n**Tephrodornis pelvicus.** Nepal Wood-shrike.\n\nOne, Ta-hnyin-taung, December, 1901.\n\n**Pericrocotus fraterculus.** Burmese Scarlet Minivet.\n\nOne, Ta-hnyin-taung, November 4th, 1901; two, same locality December 4th; one, Pauk, November 27th, 1901; one, Mt.

B. Sanyal, Bahadur, Superintendent.\n\n[Received April 29th. Read May 7th, 1902.]\n\nThe doctrine of telegony as it is understood in Europe and Australia is practically unknown in India.\n\nThere is a vague notion among some of the cattle-breeders, especially in parts of Bengal and Behar, that when first covered, a heifer ought to have a high-class bull for its mate.\n\nBe that as it may, no scientific experiments, as far as I am aware have ever been undertaken in India to test the correctness or otherwise of the doctrine to which I have alluded.\n\nI have ventured to bring the following facts to the notice of the Society, not so much for the sake of throwing any light on the subject, especially as Professor Cossar Ewart has already, after a series of careful experiments, proved that there is no equine telegony, but as they were the results of experiments in which a most interesting species of wild cattle was concerned.\n\nIn 1898 the Zoological Gardens, Calcutta, came in possession of a small herd of Bantengs (Bos sondaicus M\u00fcller and Schleg.) a species of wild cattle which mostly inhabit the plains of Burma and the Malay Peninsula and the islands of Borneo, Java, and Bali. One of the heifers was covered by an ordinary country male, which, though not a Brahmin bull as it is ordinarily understood in India, was a sturdy young bull of a very superior character. The offspring of this pairing was a healthy brindled male calf, which already promises to be a fine bull. The opportunity which this occurrence presented of examining the theory of telegony by further experiments was duly taken advantage of, and the dam of the brindled calf was mated, in proper time, with a healthy bull of its own species. The offspring of this union was a pure bred Banteng calf without any traces of the previous strain. The same cow has had a second pure-bred calf lately.\nXII.\u2014Note on a disputed point in the Life-History of Helopeltis theivora.\n\n\u2014By Harold H. Mann, B.Sc.\n\n[Received April 30th; Read May 7th, 1902.]\n\nAs is well known, Helopeltis theivora,\u2014the \"Tea Bug of Assam\" as it was called by Mr. Wood-Mason, the \"Mosquito Blight\" as it is generally termed\u2014is the most alarming pest which has yet appeared on tea cultivated in India. It causes the more disquietude as it tends to increase as years go by,\u2014fluctuating according to season, but generally increasing, and invading new areas. During 1901, which was a particularly bad year in almost all districts subject to the pest, a very moderate estimate gives seven lakhs of rupees as the nett loss to the Indian Tea Industry from this cause alone.\n\nThough we have a knowledge, thanks to Peal,* Wood-Mason,\u2020 Dudgeon,\u2021 Watt\u00a7 and Green,\u00b6 of the general life-history of the insect from the egg to the adult stage, yet there remain several points which have been very obscure. Of these the most important is the question as to what becomes of the insect during the time when it apparently disappears from the tea bush. So complete is this disappearance, as a rule, that most planters living in affected districts in North-East India have hardly ever seen a single insect during January, February and March. Mr. Dudgeon has suggested that it hibernates in the ground, but offers no evidence for his position, and declares frankly that he had not been able to verify his conjecture. It has also been supposed that hibernation takes place in water and swamps, but again, not a scrap of evidence in favour of the view exists, and the same may be said of the very general idea among tea planters that in the cold weather the Helopeltis goes on to various jungle trees.\n\nWith a view of acquiring information on this point, I have spent a considerable time in January, February and March of the present year in two of the districts most affected by the pest\u2014the Darjeeling-Terai, and Cachar\u2014at a period when the insect was supposed to be hibernating. As a result I have come to conclusions of which the following is a summary.\n\nThe Helopeltis theivora can be found on the tea bush in every stage of development during every period of the year. The cold weather\n\n* Tea Cyclopaedia, 1881.\n\u2020 The Tea Bug of Assam, 1884.\n\u2021 Indian Museum Notes. Vol. III pp. 33-38.\n\u00a7 The Pests and Blights of the Tea Plant 1898.\n\u00b6 Royal Botanic Gardens, Ceylon. Circular, No. 21 (1st Series), 1901.\nkills off the bulk of the mature insects and practically all the larvae, but at all times sufficient remain to carry on the pest to the next season, and in addition the bushes are full of eggs. These latter were found not only in the usual position on the young shoot, but also at a much lower part of the bush than has previously been noticed, embedded in the usual fashion in the midrib of the large mature leaves. The larvae were found on 11th January in small numbers on unpruned and sheltered bushes, then forming about $2\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent. of the total number of insects caught. By 12th February, however, a very different proportion of adults and larvae were obtained, and now instead of $2\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent. the larvae formed 80 per cent. of the total catch. This proportion was approximately kept up during several weeks from that date. The difficulty in obtaining evidence of their presence at this time is due to their attacking almost entirely the slightly shaded young leaves, the surface growth being rarely injured in the early part of the year.\n\nThe insect could, further, not be found on any jungle plant at this time. Though jungle of very miscellaneous character was systematically searched both by myself and by the children who are regularly catching the insect, and who are extremely expert at the work, not a single one was discovered in any form.\n\nIt appears, therefore, evident that there is, from present knowledge, no need to assume a hibernating stage at all for *Helopeltis theivora*, and that the insects remain and can be found in every stage of growth from the egg to the mature female full of eggs, in the tea-bush, at all times of the year. Whether the egg found low down in the bush, as described above, can be considered as a special hibernating egg, I can hardly say, but there certainly was no difference in structure or in method of deposition from that usual during the regular season. Inasmuch, then, as there is absolutely no evidence of the cold weather being passed by the insect in the soil, in water, or on other trees, and furthermore, as careful observation can always detect the insects and their eggs on tea bushes in affected districts, there is no need to imagine any hibernation stage at all in India, and beyond a certain retardation in development due to the reduced temperature, the reproduction of the insect may be considered to take place in a similar manner throughout the year, and to be carried out on the tea bush itself during the whole period.\n\nThese observations have a practical interest, and may lead to a sound method of attempting to deal with the pest, and experiments in this direction are now in progress.\nI am indebted to His Highness the Maharajah of Cooch Behar, and to Mr. David Ezra (who procured me the loan of them) for the opportunity of exhibiting the very remarkable pair of antlers figured below.\n\nAs will be seen they resemble those of the Sambhar (*Cervus unicolor*) in general appearance and in their rough and deeply furrowed surface; but the terminations are much more branched than is usual in this species, which has only two terminal tines. In the present specimen there are no less than five terminal points, and the two horns are not at all alike, the branch representing the longer terminal tine in the normal horn being palmate or flattened in the left horn of this pair. (See figure on page 135.)\n\nThe number of points in this specimen no doubt accounts for the statement that was made to me by Mr. Ezra, that the animal which bore the horns was a hybrid between the Sambhar and the Barasingh (*Cervus duvauceli*). But in the absence of any information as to the appearance of the rest of this stag\u2019s body, I am inclined to put the specimen down as an abnormal Sambhar, some Sambhar horns in the collection exhibited in the Mammal Gallery also showing supernumerary points, though not to this extent. A very fine head in the Asiatic Society\u2019s collection, alluded to by Mr. W. L. Sclater in his pamphlet \u201cNotes on Indian Horned Game,\u201d has nine points, both terminal tines of the right horn and the anterior or outer terminal tine of the left, being bifurcated.\n\nAnother has a third terminal tine on the right horn, directed downwards and backwards.\n\nA third has a snag to the brow tine of the right horn, the terminal tines of the beam of which are very small.\n\nA fourth has three small snags at the base of the beam of the right horn, and a small accessory snag on the large outer terminal tine of the left.\n\nIt is noteworthy that in all these cases the excess of points affects the right horn; but in one specimen, the single extra point, a very small one, is on the inner terminal tine of the left.\nMr. Ezra informs me that the present animal was killed in the Maharajah's territories six years ago.\n\nXIV.\u2014Notes on Animals observed at the Alipore Zoological Garden, No. III.\nMelanic specimens of Common Palm Squirrel (Sciurus palmarum, Linn.)\u2014By Rai R. B. Sanyal Bahadur, Superintendent, Alipore Zoological Garden.\n\n[Read June 4th, 1902.]\n\nSquirrels, it is well known, are subject to great diversity in size, form and colour. The upper surface of the body of the large Indian Squirrel (Sciurus indicus, Erxl.) is usually of a maroon red colour, but darker, almost black individuals with thicker coats are not uncommon. Apart from their seasonal dimorphism, no two specimens of the Sciurus bicolor of Sparrmann are alike; and it is no wonder that the species proved a puzzle to Desmarest, Horsfield, Is. Geoff. St. Hilaire, and other naturalists of classic repute, each of whom described it under a different name. Palm Squirrels (Sciurus palmarum, Linn.) so common and abundant in Bengal, North-Western Provinces, the Punjab, and Central India, are also remarkable for great diversity of form and colour, and this tendency to variation in colour, which is so characteristic of the genus, has led, in the case of the Palm squirrels, to an increase in the deposition of pigment, resulting in the production of a definite melanic form.\n\nMelanism as a common colour phenomenon is well known to naturalists, but as far as I remember, I have seen no case of complete melanism in squirrels recorded in the literature of the genus, and I have therefore ventured to exhibit to the Society a melanic specimen of a Palm squirrel which lately came under my observation. The following notes sent to me by Haji Mahammud Mustapha Khan of Aligarh, the donor of the animals, will, I hope, be found interesting:\n\n\"Some time in December last [1901], so far as I can recollect, my bearer came to me in Aligarh and said he had seen four or five black squirrels in the jungle at Burhegaon. Burhegaon is the headquarter village of my estate, in Tahsil Atrauli in this district, and lies about 25 miles east from Aligarh. I told him to try and catch them, and explained to him how best to do it by the usual basket snare. About a fortnight later, when I had gone to stay for a time at Burhegaon, he brought one of the squirrels to me. A couple of weeks after that he brought a second one. So far as I can judge they seem to be\na male and a female. There was a third, he told me, which eluded capture on the second occasion. They seemed to me uncommon, and remembering to have heard, at a District Board Meeting, that the Secretary of the Zoological Gardens at Alipur would be glad of help in procuring interesting additions to his family, I mentioned the matter to Mr. Brownrigg, then Collector of the District. I have always taken an interest in animals, but had never seen any black squirrels like these before. I am told that there are still, perhaps, three or four more at large in the jungle where this pair came from, but they are now very wild, and do not allow any one to approach them. I am also informed, by those who have seen them, that these black squirrels live apart by themselves on separate trees, and do not associate with their less distinguished grey-mantled brethren. The boycott is probably mutual. I have no reason to think that they came to Burhegaon from any outside source. So far as I can see they are a freak of nature.\"\n\nIt would be interesting to observe other forms of animal life in the jungle in which these melanic squirrels were found, and to note whether there is any preponderance of black in them also. The fact, if proved in the affirmative, will give additional support to the theory of colour change induced by environmental causes.\n\nThis is, however, not the first time that melanic squirrels are exhibited in the Calcutta Zoological Garden. In 1877, a couple of them were obtained from Assam, and lived for about a year.\nOn Tidal Periodicity in the Earthquakes of Assam.\u2014By R. D. Oldham, Superintendent, Geological Survey of India.\n\n(Communicated by permission of the Director of the Geological Survey of India). [Received July 21st, Read August 6th, 1902.]\n\nI.\u2014Introductory.\n\nEver since earthquakes were first studied there have been repeated and persistent attempts to trace the action of the sun, the moon, and the planets in producing them, or at the least in influencing their relative frequency. Mallet, from the discussion of his great earthquake catalogue\\(^1\\), found that there was a marked periodicity, which caused earthquakes to have a maximum frequency towards the end of each century, with a minor, but nearly as great, maximum a little before the middle; and, more recently, Dr. A. Cancani has remarked a similar peculiarity in the earthquakes of Italy.\\(^2\\) Periods of this length, however, have no direct and obvious connection with the movements of the heavenly bodies, and more interest attaches to variations of shorter periods. Perrey, and following him Mallet,\\(^3\\) believed that they had detected such variations, and that the frequency of earthquakes showed a relation to the distance of the sun and the moon from the earth, and to their relative positions in the heavens, at the syzygies and quadratures. As a result of this careful investigation it had been generally accepted that earthquakes were more frequent during winter than in summer and during the night than during the day.\n\nIn 1889 the subject was again attacked by M. F. de Montessus de Ballore,\\(^4\\) who started by preparing a catalogue of 45,000 earthquakes. From this he proceeded to discuss the diurnal periodicity, and found that though each individual list and record showed a distinct periodicity, there was no agreement among them and that the larger the number of shocks taken the more uniform became the resulting distribution of earthquakes throughout the day and night. In a subsequent paper\\(^5\\) he applied the same treatment to the seasonal periodicity with a similar result and came to the conclusion that there was no real variation in the frequency of earthquakes, which he regarded as a purely geological phenomenon, unaffected by either astronomical or meteorological influences.\n\nAbout the same time Dr. Davison began his investigation of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Rep.

The discussion of these records is not complete but in the case of one of them it has been completed, so far as one particular phase of the frequency is concerned, and the results obtained appear to be of sufficient interest to justify some notice of them.\n\nIn July of 1897, Mr. T. D. LaTouche, who was then in Shillong reporting on the results of the earthquake, constructed a seismograph on the duplex pendulum system, which was set up by the Executive Engineer, and from which continuous records have been taken ever since. The instrument, like all seismographs, is far from a perfect one, it does not record many shocks which can be distinctly felt, and it does not record the time, yet the records are of great value. In the first place we know that every shock recorded attained a certain standard of range of motion of the wave particle and of violence, if such a word may be applied to what in many cases are merely slight shocks, and that all the shocks exceeding this standard are recorded. The absence of automatic time record is more serious, but as the time of the shock was, in every case, recorded by the observer we may take it that there is no very serious error or omission in this respect. Every shock recorded represents one at approximately the time given, and the only cause likely to affect the periodicity is a possible error in the case of the night shocks: it is possible that the instrument may at times have registered a shock while the observer was asleep, and the record afterwards referred to one, felt when he was awake, which did not affect the instrument. The uncertainty due to this cause is, however, slight, as the gentlest shock registered by the instrument is sufficiently strong to usually awake a sleeper.\n\nFrom this instrument we have received records from August 1897, but those discussed as yet only extend to the end of 1901; so far they have only been examined with a view to the hourly variation in\n\n\\(^1\\) Phil. Trans. clxxiv, A, 1107 (1893).\nfrequency, and instead of contenting myself with a mere record of the relative frequency of the earthquakes, as has usually been done in the past, I have made an attempt to see whether there is any trace of extraterrestrial influence in this frequency.\n\nAs pointed out by me in a short note published in 1901\\(^1\\) any effect which the attraction of the sun and the moon may have, will be most effectively, if not solely, exerted by the Tide-producing forces they set up, and that, to trace the effect of these, it is not sufficient to merely tabulate earthquakes by the hours in which they occur. The time at which the tide-producing forces reach their maximum depends on the declination of the sun and the moon, that is to say it is subject to seasonal variations, and to determine whether these forces have any influence it is necessary to classify the records, according to the position of the sun or moon with reference to the equator, and then examine the frequency to see whether there is any variation which can be correlated with the tidal forces.\n\nII.\u2014Statement of the Problem.\n\nThere is neither space nor occasion to recapitulate what is known of the theory of the tides, but a brief account of the form of the tide-producing influence of the attraction of the sun and the moon is desirable, that the nature of the effect to be looked for may be clearly understood, and the review will be simplified by the fact that we need not consider the theory of the tides themselves, but merely of the stresses to which they owe their origin. Omitting all reference to the why, it will be sufficient to point out that the effect of the attraction of a satellite\u2014and in this connection the sun is regarded as a satellite equally with the moon\u2014is to produce a stress equivalent to an upward force at the spot which is at any moment directly under the satellite, and at the antipodes of that spot. Along the great circle half way between these two spots, separated from each by \\(90^\\circ\\) of arc, there is a force acting downwards towards the centre of the earth, and equal in amount to one half of the upward force. At spots between these two points and the great circle just referred to, the stresses produced are equivalent to forces acting in directions away from the vertical, and along a circle which is distant about \\(54^\\circ 44' 14''\\) from the spots where the satellite is in the zenith or nadir the force acts horizontally.\n\nNow if we suppose the force exerted at any point to be resolved into two separate forces, one acting vertically and the other horizontally, then the vertical force attains its upward maximum where the satellite is in the zenith or nadir, and its downward maximum along the great circle intersecting the line joining these two points and lying at right\n\n\\(^1\\) Geol. Mag. 4. Decade, viii, 449, (1901).\nangles to it. The horizontal force attains its maximum along two circles distant about $54^\\circ 44'$ from the zenith and nadir respectively, the direction being towards the satellite in the former case and away from it in the latter. If then the tidal stresses have any influence in determining the time of origin of earthquakes we should look for the effect in connection with these circles.\n\nBoth sun and moon, as is well known, vary their position in the heavens, travelling alternately north and south of the equator, the sun moving to about $23^\\circ$, and the moon to about $26^\\circ$, from it. From this it follows that neither can ever be in the zenith of any spot distant more than $26^\\circ$ from the earth's equator, that is in more than $26^\\circ$ of latitude either north or south, and no spot situated outside those limits can ever experience the maximum upward force. Within those limits, at either one or two periods in each year, when the declination of the sun and the latitude of any given place are the same in amount and sign, the maximum upward force, due to the sun, will be experienced at midday and midnight; and similarly in each lunar month there will be either one or two periods at which the maximum upward force will be experienced, when the moon is either overhead, mid-moon-day, or underfoot, mid-moon-night. Outside the limits of the two $26^\\circ$ parallels, and within them at all times when the declination of the sun or moon is different in amount or sign from the latitude, the maximum upward force will not be experienced, but, as the earth revolves on its axis, the circles of maximum horizontal and downward force sweep over its surface, and pass any given place at an interval, before and after the meridian passage of the satellite, which depends on the declination of the satellite at the time and the latitude of the place.\n\nFrom these considerations it will be seen that, before discussing the frequency of earthquakes with reference to the tidal stresses, it is necessary to group them according to their place of origin, and then see whether, for any one district, there is a connection between the relative frequency of earthquakes and the times of passage, over the epicentre, of the circles of maximum tidal force.\n\nOne method of discovering whether there is any such connection would be to calculate for each earthquake the exact time which separated the time of its origin from that of the passage of each of the circles of maximum tidal force, and then to classify the records according to these intervals, and see whether there was any preponderance of earthquakes at or about these times. The process would be a laborious one, and, in view of the want of exact accuracy in the times, did not seem worth going through, as a result within the limits of accuracy of the records can be obtained in a simpler manner.\nWe may assume that the epicentres of the earthquakes now under consideration all lie in 26\u00b0 N. Lat., without introducing any material error, and, calculating for that latitude the time intervals, which elapse between the meridian passage of the satellite and the passage of the tidal circles, we obtain, for extreme and mean values of declination the intervals given in the tabular statement below, where 0 h represents the lower, and 12 h. the upper, meridian passage, or midnight and midday in the case of the sun.\n\nI.\u2014Table showing the times of passage of circles of maximum horizontal and vertical Tide-producing force; calculated for Lat. 26\u00b0 N.\n\n| Decl. | Hor. force, Direct. | Vert. force, Downward. | Hor. force, Indirect. |\n|-------|---------------------|------------------------|----------------------|\n|       | 12 h. \u00b1 h. m.       | 0 h. \u00b1 h. m.           | 0 h. \u00b1 h. m.         |\n| 26\u00b0 N.| 4\u00b715                | 4\u00b738                   |                      |\n| 9\u00b0 N. | 3\u00b731                | 5\u00b734                   | 2\u00b714                 |\n| 0\u00b0    | 2\u00b759                | 6\u00b70                    | 2\u00b759                 |\n| 9\u00b0 S. | 2\u00b714                | 6\u00b726                   | 3\u00b731                 |\n| 26\u00b0 S.|                    | 7\u00b722                   | 4\u00b715                 |\n\nFrom this table it is obvious that, if the total number of shocks is divided into three groups, according to the position of the sun, the first comprising those which occurred when the sun was more than 9\u00b0 N., the second when its declination did not exceed 9\u00b0 N. or S. and the third when the declination was more than 9\u00b0 S., then in the first group the effect of the horizontal force must be looked for between $3\\frac{1}{2}$ and 4 hours before and after midday, and within two hours on each side of midnight; in the second group the effect is to be looked for between 3 and $3\\frac{1}{2}$ hours on either side of midnight and midday; while in the third the condition will be the same as in the first, with the substitution of midnight and midday. Moreover, as the effect may be due rather to the rapidity of changes in the amount, than to the actual amount, of the force exerted, the horizontal force may have but small influence when the passage of the circles takes place at less than two hours on either side of the meridian passage, that is to say, when the intersection of the circles is oblique, and the rate and range of change in the amount of force is less than when the passage takes place at a greater time-interval than 2 hours from the meridian passage. This, combined with the much greater length of time during\n\n---\n\n1 The intervals are not exactly the same on either side of the meridian passage on account of the motion of the sun and moon in the heavens, but the inequality is not sufficient to be of importance in this connection.\nwhich the interval exceeds three hours, shows that in a general list of all the shocks the effect must be looked for between 3 and 4 hours on either side of midday and midnight. Further, as it is a common phenomenon in nature that the maximum of effect lags behind the maximum of cause, it may be that the effect will not be found between 3 and 4 hours on either side of the meridian passages, but at some time after that epoch. Another effect which may be looked for, which follows from the consideration of the greater efficiency of the force when its rate of variation is greater, is that we may expect the number of shocks recorded during the day to be proportionately greater when the sun is more than 9\u00b0 N., that is during the summer, and the night shocks to be proportionately more numerous during the winter, when the sun is more than 9\u00b0 South of the equator.\n\nThere is another supposition which must also be tested, that the effect, if any, of the tidal forces is not to be looked for in connection with the times when they attain their maximum, but with the times at which the rate of change, of amount and direction of the forces, is at its maximum. For any particular place the rate of change always reaches its maximum at 3 hours before and after the meridian passage, but along a great circle, passing through the place of observation and the place where the satellite is in the zenith, the maximum rate of change is at 45\u00b0 from the latter, and it will be useful to see what is the time interval for different declinations at which a circle 45\u00b0 distant from this spot passes the place of observation. The result is given in the following table.\n\nII.\u2014Times of passage of circles of maximum rate of change of the Tide-producing forces calculated for Lat. 26\u00b0 N.\n\n| Decl. | Direct. | Indirect. |\n|-------|---------|-----------|\n|       | 12h \u00b1   | 0h \u00b1      |\n| 26\u00b0N. | 3-22    |           |\n| 9\u00b0N.  | 2-56    | 1-56      |\n| 0\u00b0    | 2-33    | 2-33      |\n| 9\u00b0S.  | 1-56    | 2-56      |\n| 26\u00b0S. |         | 3-22      |\n\nIt must be distinctly understood that the times given in this table are not those at which the rate of change is actually greatest, but those at which the rate is greatest, as measured along a different circle to the east and west one, along which the place of observation travels. In the solitary case where this place and the satellite are both on the equator the two agree, and in no other; but the table is useful, for the closer the\nvalue in the table approximates to 3 hours the greater is that rate of change, and the closer it lies to 0 h. or 12 h. the less is the rate of variation of the tide-producing forces.\n\nThe passage of the circles of maximum vertical force is not subject to the same changes as that of the other circles, and never varies more than 1 h. 22 m. from six o'clock; the effect of this force must therefore be looked for about that time in the morning and evening or somewhat later.\n\nFinally, it is necessary to notice one objection, which might be raised to the preceding passages, that the effect is not necessarily to be looked for at any fixed time before or after the meridian passage of the satellite, but that, for each place, there will be something equivalent to what is known as the \"establishment\" of a port in the case of marine tides. The objection, however, is not valid, for in this case we have not to do with free travelling waves, like that of the tides, which take a greater or less time to travel from the place where they originate to the place where they are felt, but with the direct effect of the stresses which produce the waves. These depend solely on the latitude of the place and the declination of the satellite, and for them there is nothing in any way analogous to the \"establishment\" to be considered.\n\nIII. DISCUSSION OF THE DATA.\n\nAfter this preliminary exposition of what is to be looked for, we may pass on to a consideration of the results obtained. In the record discussed there are contained 1274 distinct shocks, and, on counting these, it was found that, in each hour of the twenty-four, the number of shocks recorded was as given in the tabular statement No. III, where all shocks recorded from 0 h. to 0 h. 59 m. are placed under 0, those between 1 h. and 1 h. 59 m. under 1 and so on.\n\nThe most casual inspection of this table shows that the shocks are not at all uniformly distributed during the twenty-four hours, and that there is a great preponderance during the hours preceding midnight, with a lesser increase towards 6 A.M. It may also be noted that the night shocks seem more numerous when the sun is more that 9\u00b0 S and the day shocks when it is more than 9\u00b0 N, but no proper comparison is possible on account of the difference in the total number of shocks in each line. For comparison they must be brought all to the same ratio, and this may be done, either by calculating the percentage of the total number of shocks recorded in each hour, or more simply by dividing each figure by the mean value for the line; this gives a result showing the proportion of the number of shocks recorded in each hour to the average number for one hour. In this way we get the result shown in the next tabular statement.\n\nJ. ii. 19\n### III.\u2014Hourly distribution of Shocks.\n\n| Sun's Declination | Hours | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | Total |\n|-------------------|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|\n| >9\u00b0N              | ...   | 11| 15| 16| 12| 13| 24| 24| 8 | 22| 12| 22| 21| 16| 13| 22| 12| 27| 16| 14| 17| 21| 30| 28| 20| 436|\n| 9\u00b0N-9\u00b0S           | ...   | 5 | 8 | 14| 14| 26| 14| 16| 9 | 15| 13| 14| 11| 18| 9 | 22| 22| 11| 12| 13| 19| 17| 21| 19| 358|\n| >9\u00b0S              | ...   | 17| 21| 29| 29| 22| 19| 30| 16| 10| 15| 8 | 19| 16| 12| 17| 13| 22| 19| 22| 20| 20| 24| 41| 19| 480|\n| **Total**         | ...   | 33| 44| 59| 55| 61| 57| 70| 40| 41| 42| 43| 54| 43| 43| 48| 47| 71| 46| 48| 50| 60| 71| 90| 58| 1274|\n\n### IV.\u2014Proportionate distribution of Shocks by hours.\n\n| Sun's Declination | Hours | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 |\n|-------------------|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|\n| >9\u00b0N              | ...   | .61| .83| .88| .66| .71| 1.32| 1.32| .44| 1.21| .66| 1.21| 1.16| .88| .72| 1.21| .66| 1.49| .88| .77| .93| 1.16| 1.65| 1.54| 1.10|\n| 9\u00b0N-9\u00b0S           | ...   | .33| .54| .94| 1.74| .94| 1.07| 1.07| .60| 1.01| .87| .94| .74| 1.21| .60| 1.47| 1.47| .74| .81| .87| 1.27| 1.14| 1.41| 1.27|\n| >9\u00b0S              | ...   | .85| 1.05| 1.45| 1.45| 1.10| .95| 1.50| .80| .50| .75| .40| .95| .80| .60| .85| .65| 1.10| .95| 1.10| 1.00| 1.00| 1.20| 2.05| .95|\n| **All shocks**    | ...   | .60| .80| 1.09| 1.02| 1.19| 1.07| 1.30| .77| .77| .80| .83| 1.02| .80| .84| .89| .93| 1.35| .86| .89| .94| 1.14| 1.32| 1.67| 1.11|\nFig. 1. Curves of diurnal distribution of earthquakes. The continuous line is the general curve obtained from all shocks. The broken line represents the distribution of shocks occurring when the sun's declination was more than $9^\\circ$N. The dotted line is the curve for shocks occurring when the declination was more than $9^\\circ$S.\nHere we again see that the day shocks are proportionately more numerous when the sun has declination of more than $9^\\circ N.$ than when the sun is more than $9^\\circ S.$ of the equator, and that in the latter case the night shocks are proportionately more numerous than in the former. It is also evident, from the irregularity of distribution from hour to hour, that the number of shocks is not enough to give a near approach to the true curve, when plotted directly, and a process of smoothing has to be adopted. This has been done by adding together the number of shocks recorded during each group of three successive hours and, by regarding them as grouped round the centre of the middle hour, obtaining a fresh series of hourly means, from which a great deal of the irregularity of the curve has disappeared. The result is represented graphically in Fig. 1, so far as the shocks which occurred when the sun was more than $9^\\circ$ north and south of the equator respectively.\n\nFrom this curve it will be seen that as regards the shocks occurring about two hours before midnight there is little difference, but that for the rest of the twenty-four hours the curve for south declination is steadily above that for north declination throughout the twelve hours of the night, and below it for the day. Moreover there is a distinct maximum in the earthquakes recorded round three hours after and two hours before midnight, while the earthquakes recorded near midnight are much more frequent than when the sun was more than $9^\\circ$ north of the equator. Turning to the shocks recorded when the sun was north of the equator, not only are they proportionately more numerous, than when it was south but there is again a distinct pair of maxima, shortly before and three hours after midday. Among the shocks recorded when the sun was within $9^\\circ$ of the equator we have maxima distinctly marked at about 5 hours after midnight and midday, another at about 2 hours before midnight and a less marked one at about 2 hours before midday.\n\nThere is consequently an approach to what might be expected if the tide-producing forces caused by the attraction of the sun had their effect in determining the time of origin of earthquakes, but it is also evident that, if these forces have any effect, it is so small and so complicated by other causes, giving rise to a greater variation in frequency than they do, that it is necessary to adopt some method of discussion, which will more or less completely eliminate the effects of variation, other than those due to the tide-producing forces.\n\nThe most obvious of these would be the conversion of the solar into lunar times. The moon moves through the heavens at a rate which brings it on the average about 50 minutes in advance of the sun for each day. If, then, we consider the interval between the two\nsuccessive similar meridian passages of the moon as representing 24 lunar hours, and convert the recorded times into lunar times, it is obvious that, in a long series of observations, any irregularity of frequency, at any particular hour of solar time, will get spread over the whole of the lunar day, and in its place will be introduced any fresh irregularity due to the position of the moon. Now as the moon has twice the efficiency of the sun, as a tide producer, any irregularities due to the tide producing forces should be double as great as in the case of the sun.\n\nUnfortunately the test cannot be applied in this case as, on trial, it was found that the series of observations was not sufficiently long to eliminate the effect of the diurnal irregularities.\n\nThis method of elimination failing, we must fall back on the recorded times, to see whether there is no other method of eliminating the non-tidal diurnal variation, and a method appears which depends on the fact that, taking the year as a whole, the tidal effect is on the average the same all through, since the times of passage of the tidal circles during the six hours on either side of midnight are the same for a south declination as the times on either side of midday in the case of the same amount of north declination.\n\nIf, then, we take the recorded frequency of shocks for each hour, write them down in two lines, placing those for the hour after midday under those for the hour after midnight and so on, and then add the two lines, we obtain a series of numbers representing the semi-diurnal curve of frequency. In this curve any diurnal periodicity, which is of a harmonic nature, is completely eliminated, and any non-harmonic periodicity largely reduced in amount. On the other hand any semi-diurnal periodicity which is harmonic in character, or which, if not harmonic, has its irregularities similarly distributed with regard to midnight and midday, will be exaggerated; that is to say the effect we are looking for will be increased, while that which we wish to eliminate will be reduced, in amount.\n\nIn the next tabular statement the process is illustrated as regards the total number of shocks, and four more lines given, showing the results obtained in the case of certain combinations of shocks, which will be referred to further on.\nV.\u2014Semidiurnal distribution of Shocks.\n\n| Hours | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   | 10  | 11  |\n|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n|       | 12  | 13  | 14  | 15  | 16  | 17  | 18  | 19  | 20  | 21  | 22  | 23  |\n| All shocks 0 h. to 11 h. | 33  | 44  | 59  | 55  | 61  | 57  | 70  | 40  | 41  | 42  | 43  | 54  |\n| Do. 12 h. to 23 h. | 43  | 43  | 48  | 47  | 71  | 46  | 48  | 50  | 60  | 71  | 90  | 58  |\n| Sum | 76  | 87  | 107 | 102 | 132 | 103 | 118 | 90  | 101 | 113 | 133 | 112 |\n\nSum \u00f7 Mean | .72 | .81 | 1.01 | .96 | 1.26 | .97 | 1.11 | .85 | .95 | 1.06 | 1.25 | 1.05 |\n\nDay shocks >9\u00b0 N. | .80 | .82 | 1.23 | .99 | 1.18 | .84 | 1.11 | .67 | 1.01 | .87 | 1.52 | .96 |\n\nNight shocks >9\u00b0 S. | .53 | .87 | .77 | 1.20 | 1.61 | .84 | .94 | .97 | .94 | 1.08 | 1.14 | 1.11 |\n\nAll shocks 9\u00b0 N. to 9\u00b0 S. | .69 | .84 | 1.04 | 1.08 | 1.36 | .84 | 1.04 | .80 | .98 | .95 | 1.36 | 1.02 |\n\nDay shocks >9\u00b0 N. | .77 | .77 | .94 | .71 | 1.00 | 1.23 | 1.26 | .94 | .94 | 1.29 | 1.03 | 1.12 |\n\nNight shocks >9\u00b0 N. | .77 | .77 | .94 | .71 | 1.00 | 1.23 | 1.26 | .94 | .94 | 1.29 | 1.03 | 1.12 |\n\nHere we see two very marked maxima, in the distribution of the shocks, one during the fifth hour after, the other during the second hour before, the meridian passage, and these maxima may be taken as grouped around $4\\frac{1}{2}$ hours and $10\\frac{1}{2}$ hours of the morning and afternoon. That is to say they both follow by $1\\frac{1}{2}$ hours the epoch corresponding to three hours before and after the meridian passage, a time which corresponds more closely to the passage of the maximum rate of change of tidal force, than to that of the circle of maximum horizontal stress.\n\nIf we turn to the next line in the table, representing the distribution when the tide producing forces may be expected to be most effective, we find the same features, except that the maximum following the meridian passage is less marked than that which precedes it, and that though the latter is proportionately greater than in the case of the whole number of shocks the former is less.\n\nThe next line shows the distribution when the sun is within 9\u00b0 of the Equator, when on the average the conditions\u2014so far as the tide generating forces are concerned\u2014are the same during the day as the night. Here we find the two maxima again, but it is that following the meridian passage which is most conspicuous, the other being small and ill defined.\nThe fact is that in both these cases the total number of shocks considered is too small to get an approach to a true average, and, in this small number of shocks, accidental variations of distribution may produce an irregularity of the curve which exceeds its normal variation.\n\nTo some extent this difficulty may be overcome. If we refer to the tables I and II, we will see that when the sun is within 9\u00b0 of the equator, there is not a very great variation in the times of passage of the tidal circles as compared with the times of passage during the day when the sun is north, and during the night when it is south, of the equator. On the other hand the night when the sun is north, and the day when the sun is south, of the equator, show a much greater range of time in the passage of the circles and not only is the range of time greater and the effect consequently less conspicuous, but during part of the time the maximum of horizontal force is not felt at all, and during the rest of the time the passage is so oblique that the rate of change is slow and the tidal forces probably less effective.\n\nExcluding these shocks we may add together the two groups of shocks already considered and so obtain a larger one, in which the tidal effect is tolerably uniform. The result is given in the table, and shown graphically in Fig. 2. Here it will be seen that the two maxima preceding and following the meridian passage are both distinct, and exceed those obtained from the total number of shocks.\n\n**Shillong Seismograph 1897-1901. Semidiurnal curve of frequency.**\n\n![Graph](image)\n\n**Fig. 2. Semidiurnal curves of frequency.**\nWe have consequently the effect which was to be looked for if the frequency of earthquakes is influenced, either by the amount of the horizontal tide generating force, or by the rate of change of the tide generating forces, and the fact that this effect becomes more marked the larger the number of shocks\u2014suitably distributed as regards time of occurrence\u2014which are taken into consideration, lends support to the supposition that the apparent relation between cause and effect is a real one.\n\nPassing on to the last line, representing the night shocks when the declination is north and the day shocks when it is south, that is to say a time when the rate of variation of the tidal stresses is at its lowest and less effect to be looked for, we find that the marked maxima have disappeared, and that there is an almost equally distinct increase in frequency about six o'clock, that is at a time corresponding to the passage of the circles of maximum vertical force. This has the appearance of indicating that the purely vertical stresses have less influence than those which have a large element of horizontal stress, and that the effect of the former only becomes apparent when that of the latter becomes small. Too much stress must not, however, be attached to this conjecture, as the number of shocks dealt with is smaller than in any of the other combinations, and the possibility of fortuitous irregularities in the curve more probable in a corresponding degree, and besides this the effect here only lags half an hour behind the presumed cause, while in the case of the $4\\frac{1}{2}$ and $10\\frac{1}{2}$ hour maxima it lags $1\\frac{1}{2}$ hours behind the presumed cause.\n\nIt appears then that the tidal stresses have a distinct effect in determining the time of origin of earthquakes, though their influence is small in proportion to other causes, but at the same time it is necessary to enter a caution that, though the facts in this case seem to support the conclusion, they are far from proving it. For proof a more extended series of observations are required, not only from Assam, but from other stations also, and even in the record discussed in this paper there is reason to doubt the correctness of the conclusion, inasmuch as the effect found appears to be out of proportion to the cause invoked.\n\nWhen we consider that the maximum upward tidal force exerted by the moon is only $1/8, 450,000$ of gravity, that this corresponds very closely to the difference in downward strain which would be produced by the removal or replacement of half a grain on a one-ton weight, that the maximum horizontal tide generating force is only three quarters of this, and finally that the tide generating forces set up by the sun are a little less than half of those set up by the moon, it is surprising that they should have any effect at all. On the other hand when we consider that these\nforces are sufficient to give rise to the tides, and that the difference between the spring tides and the neaps is due to the forces whose effect has been searched for in this paper, it is quite conceivable that they should not be without effect in determining the moment at which a gradually increasing strain becomes too great for the resistance, and the fracture is produced which gives rise to an earthquake.\n\nIV.\u2014Conclusions.\n\nFrom what has gone before we may draw the following conclusions.\n\n1. That there was a very large variation in the diurnal distribution of earthquakes in Assam during the years 1897-1901, shocks being most frequent between 10 and 11 p.m., and again between 6 and 7 a.m. This greater frequency is a real one and not merely due to a larger number of shocks happening to be recorded at those times.\n\nNo satisfactory cause can be assigned for this irregularity of distribution, which must for the present be accepted as a fact true for a limited period and area.\n\n2. Superimposed on this large and unexplained variation in frequency, there is a smaller variation which has the appearance of being due to the tidal stresses set up by the attraction of the sun.\n\n3. If this smaller variation is really due to tidal stress, then the horizontal stress is much more efficient than the vertical stress, and the effect is less due to the amount of the stress than to the rate and range of its variation.\n\n4. That these conclusions must be taken as purely provisional and require verification from a more extended series of observations. For their verification we require an instrumental record from some station within or near the tropics, where earthquakes are fairly frequent, and extending over 19 or 20 years.\nA. Some Striking Cases of Variation in Structural Characters.\n\nI have occasionally been able to note marked deviations in structure, which might conceivably have been useful in some cases.\n\nThus I saw at a Pigeon show in Oxford, on October 23rd, 1891, a white Fantail Pigeon with the two inner front toes on each foot webbed. The abnormality is not common, but has been recorded by Darwin. (Animals and Plants under Domestication, Vol. I. p., 160).\n\nI obtained in Port Said in 1894 the feet of a common fowl with a long hallux like a Curassow's but not apparently capable of flexion at the terminal joint, being more like the supernumerary hallux so often present in these birds\u2014especially in Port Said specimens, where every gradation between this and the normal hallux may be seen.\n\nIn Zanzibar, where the fowls are usually of the long-legged Malay type, I occasionally saw a very short-legged specimen with the usual long neck. As there are some breeds of fowls, e.g., the Japanese Bantam, wherein the legs are always very short, this is probably an easily perpetuated and abrupt variation.\n\nAt a meeting of the British Ornithologists' Club last year, Mr. W. B. Tegetmeier showed the head of a wild Rook (Corvus frugilegus) with a remarkably elongated beak approaching in form that of a Chough.\n\nThe Chough itself (Graculus graculus) in confinement is liable to an elongation of the bill which is often very regular, and makes the beak resemble that of an Ibis. This might well occur in the wild state\u2014as overgrowth of the upper chap is known to do in some birds\u2014and be of service. The subjacent tissues may also penetrate the overgrowth of horn, for Mr. Rutledge found on attempting to cut back the overgrown bills of some Choughs that this could not be done, as blood was drawn in cutting off the first half inch.\n\nRecently I procured in the Calcutta Bazaar a common Quail (Coturnix communis), possessing on each foot five toes like a Dorking fowl. In each case, as so often happens in five-toed fowls, the true hallux was higher up the shank than usual. The upper supernumerary hallux was quite distinct, but shorter than the normal one, whereas in five-toed fowls it is usually longer. One only of these extra toes had a claw, but as it was loose on the other, and ultimately came off, it had\nevidently become accidentally detached from one toe. An enlarged drawing of these feet is given below.\n\n![Five-toed Feet of Common Quail]\n\nAs five-toed birds do not occur as natural species, this instance may seem off the point, but it has its interest from the point of view of Analogous Variation.\n\nIn the London Zoological Garden last year there was a male Curassow with the yellow nasal knob on the bill double, the extra part being somewhat out of line with the normal lump, and extending behind it.\n\nB. Some Colour-Variations in Wild Birds.\n\nThe Garganey or Blue-winged Teal (*Querquedula circaea*) is very liable to produce a pallid variation, in which the usual brown markings are reproduced in a pale dun shade. These pale forms vary in pallor, but do not grade into the normal type. Males and females are about equally affected. The irides of such birds are normal, but their bills and feet are flesh-coloured instead of slaty. A white Garganey I once saw as a skin seemed, however to have had dark bill and feet. Mr. E. C. S. Baker records (*J.B.N.H.S.*, Vol. XII., p. 446), a Garganey with orange\nfeet, with, I presume (as he says nothing to the contrary) normal plumage. After examining hundreds of both this species and the Common Teal (*Nettium crecca*), I have never seen any variation in the latter.\n\nSnipe (*Gallinago celestis* and *G. stenura*) frequently present pallid forms, which, as in the Garganey, vary *inter se* but do not grade into the type. I was fortunate last winter in procuring, in addition to a pallid specimen of the Fantailed species, a Pintail Snipe, which was a pied bird of remarkable aspect. The general plumage was normal, but the dark-streaked buff plumage of the fore-neck and breast was interrupted by a longitudinal white patch, and there was a great deal of white in both wings. The right wing had the first three primaries white, together with nearly all the wing-coverts of the outer part of the wing, forming a conspicuous patch. On the left wing all the primaries were white, and a still greater extent of the wing-coverts. The irides, bill and feet were normal, except that the toes were fleshy orange instead of olive-green like the shanks. (Ind. Mus. Reg. 24155, \u00a7.)\n\nI have thought it worthwhile to have this specimen figured (Plate VIII, fig. A), together with two pallid specimens of this species (*G. stenura*) (Plate VIII, figs. B, C) of different shades.\n\nPallid forms of the Indian House-Crow (*Corvus splendens*) are not rare; one of a pale fawn, with the face and wings darker, lived 15 years in the Calcutta Zoological Garden; this had fleshy white bill and feet. Some rather similar specimens in the Indian Museum have, however, evidently had dark bills and feet. The white specimens we have have had fleshy white bills and feet, and this has been the case with all the white Jackdaws (*Corvus monedula*) I have seen in England; about half-a-dozen in all. (I believe, however, these white Jackdaws are a domesticated race).\n\nI have thrice in seven years secured pallid varieties of the Rain-Quail (*Coturnix coromandelica*), once only of the common Quail (*C. communis*), though this is more abundant in the Calcutta Market. These birds have always been hens. I have now got another hen Rain-Quail with all the primaries and their coverts, with the two outer feathers of bastard-wing, pure white in the left wing; on the right side, all the primaries but the fourth, ninth and tenth, with the distal primary coverts, were white, but bastard-wing normal. The centre of the throat and a patch on the fore-neck, were also white. (Reg. No. 24229). The irides, bill, and feet were normal.\n\nGrey or slate-coloured varieties are not common, but I have seen two such in the Jackdaw (*Corvus monedula*), one in the King-crow or Black Drongo (*Dicrurus ater*) and one in the Bengal Bulbul (*Molpastes bengalensis*). In the last-named bird the red under-tail-coverts persisted.\nRecently Mr. Rutledge obtained a pale ash-coloured House-crow (*Corvus splendens*), a young bird, with dark-lead-coloured bill and feet, and wings and tail faintly barred with darker grey than the ground-colour.\n\nWhite varieties are so well known as to need little comment; they are seldom pink-eyed like albino mammals. Red often persists in such; I have seen an albino red-whiskered Bulbul (*Otocompsa emeria*) retaining the red \"whiskers\" and under-tail-coverts, and an albino Goldfinch (*Carduelis carduelis*) retaining the red face and yellow wing-bars.\n\nIn India I have seen two pale varieties of the crimson-breasted Barbet or Coppersmith (*Xantholema h\u00e6matocephala*), one in the Indian Museum, and one now alive at the Alipore Zoological Garden. In the former (Reg. No. B5031) the plumage is yellowish white except the primary-coverts and several quills from the sixth onwards, which are normal. The stiff glossy frontal feathers and breast patch are pale yellow instead of scarlet. The beak is yellowish white in the skin. In the latter, captured adult, the red of forehead, breast, and feet persists. The bill is flesh-coloured instead of black. The plumage is pale yellow, irregularly marked with green. It has not changed in moulting.\n\nThe common Ring-Parroquet (*Pal\u00e6ornis torquatus*) frequently produces a yellow variety, in which the red bill in both sexes and red collar of the male persists. I have also seen, besides numerous green birds splashed with yellow, a bird of an even intermediate tint between yellow and green. Specimens shaded with green on a yellow ground are not uncommon. Mr. W. Rutledge knows of a case where two normally coloured wild birds constantly produced a yellow brood.\n\nThe large Ring-Parroquet and its races (*Pal\u00e6ornis nepalensis*, &c.), is very rarely lutinistic; we have, however, in the Indian Museum a green-tinted lutino of the large-billed Andaman race still showing the red wing-patch. (Reg. No. 22071).\n\nThe Rose-headed Parroquet (*P. cyanocephala*) is not infrequently yellow, when the head is pink (as in specimen 23981, Ind. Mus. Reg.).\n\nIn the Indian Museum there is a specimen of the Blue-crowned Hanging Parroquet (*Loriculus galgulus*) with primaries nearly all yellow and many other yellow feathers. The bill is black as in the normal birds, but the blue patch on the head is replaced by a faint red one. (Reg. No. B. 342).\n\nI once, in England, saw a wild Song-Thrush (*Turdus musicus*) with the tip of the tail regularly white; but it had an abnormal-looking patch of white on one wing also.\n\nThe Calcutta Zoological Garden once possessed a Coucal or Crow-Pheasant (*Centropus sinensis*) with bill and feet normally black, normal\nred irides and chestnut wings, and all the rest of the plumage white, where it should have been black. In the Museum is a pale dun bird of this species with pale chestnut wings, and the two central tail feathers decidedly fibrous and loose in texture. (Reg. No. B. 7220 procured in Purneah 1871). Mr. Rutledge recently had a dun-coloured male Ko\u00ebl (Eudynamis honorata) with fleshy-white bill and feet, but normal eyes. Its plumage faded before moulting, to cream-colour, like a dun pigeon's, the new feathers being strikingly darker.\n\nI have discussed the question of the white-headed form of the Ruff (Pavoncella pugnax leucoprora) in J.A.S.B., Pt. II, 1902, p. 82. Both the living Ruffs mentioned there assumed pure white ruffs and ear-tufts this year; but one had a rufous-marked back, and the other\u2014with the white tertaries\u2014a grizzled one.\n\nC. Reversion to Normal Colour in Abnormal Varieties.\n\nA much-prized albino or lutino specimen, taken in that condition, often disappoints its owner by moulting out into the normal colour. Mr. W. Rutledge tells me that this is always liable to happen unless the individual has pink eyes or an abnormally white bill or feet. I have seen entire or partial resumption of the normal colour in two House-Mynahs (Acridotheres tristis), and a Babbler (Crateropus canorus) in his possession. (See paper on Variation above quoted, J.A.S.B. 1902, also Bateson, Materials for the Study of Variation, p. 43, foot note 2).\n\nPallid specimens are also liable to revert in this way. A male cream-coloured sparrow I recently obtained put out new feathers of a nearly normal colour, and I have seen a skin of the House-Mynah in the same condition. The grey Bengal Bulbul above alluded to, however, has never reverted; its bill and feet are normally black, as were those of the two grey Jackdaws mentioned with it.\n\nThe same phenomenon has occurred in the case of melanism. A Bullfinch (Pyrrhula pyrrhula) found as a black nestling in an otherwise normal brood, attained on moulting ordinary female plumage (Howard Saunders, Manual of British Birds, p. 188, ed. 1889).\n\nIt seems to me that such facts as these furnish a simple explanation of the case of those Herons which are white only in youth.\n\nVariations in Relation of Immature to Adult Plumage.\n\nDarwin gives several cases of this on Blyth's authority, and I can add a few myself.\n\nThe skin of a young Crow-Pheasant (Centropus sinensis) in the Indian Museum (Reg. No. 11265 from Bhowra) already shows in per-\nfection the rich blue-black body and chestnut wings of the adult, instead of the usual barred plumage of immaturity. Birds resembling the adult in everything except in being duller are quite common.\n\nThe young of the King-crow (*Dicrurus ater*) and the small Indian Cormorant (*Phalacrocorax javanicus*) are supposed to be mottled with white beneath, but all the nestlings I have seen in Calcutta have been black like adults. Yet the *Dicrurus* does undoubtedly have a white-spotted immature plumage, and some young Cormorants I reared afterwards moulted out mottled below, so that apparently a reversion may take place at the moult.\n\nSimilarly, the young Pied Hornbills (*Anthracoceros albirostris*) frequently sold here are always coloured like the adult; but one I knew of moulted out in confinement with white tips and bars to the feathers; a white-barred feathering being given as the young plumage of the closely-allied *A. coronatus* by Parker (Blanford, *F.B.I. Birds*, Vol. III., p. 145).\n\nThe young of the common Mynah (*Acridotheres tristis*), normally resemble the adult except in being duller, but I have seen two with brown heads instead of black; this is much more common in the young of the allied Bank Mynah (*A. ginginianus*).\n\nThe young females of the Golden-backed Woodpecker (*Brachypternus aurantius*), are described as having a black forehead, whereas that of the old bird is spotted with white. Often, however, young hens occur in which the forehead is spotted, sometimes as clearly as an adult's.\n\n**D. Variation in Prepotency.**\n\nThe silver-grey gander mentioned in the note on the variations of the Gray Goose was an example of spontaneous prepotency. Such a variation in the wild state might easily have produced the white and partially white males in the sexually dimorphic species of the genus *Chloephaga*; *C. hybrida*\u2014the Rock-Goose of Darwin\u2014and *C. magellanica*, the familiar Magellan Goose of waterfowl fanciers, the Upland Goose of the *Origin of Species*, and a third species barely distinct specifically from *C. magellanica*\u2014*C. dispar*, in which the male is barred beneath like the female.\n\nThe species *C. rubidiceps*, which is extremely like a small female of *C magellanica*, may be taken as one in which no variation in the direction of gray-and-white ganders has appeared, or if it did occur, has not been perpetuated by natural or sexual selection.\n\nI have come upon some curious instances of the opposite attribute to prepotency in pigeons. In 1894 I crossed a well-developed and fully-adult Black Fantail Cock with a young and hitherto unmated Homer\nhen. The Fantail had 33 tail-feathers, the Homer of course only the usual twelve. Yet the pair of mongrel squabs which resulted from their union had only 14 and 15 tail-feathers respectively. I may mention that the Homer hen's subsequent offspring by a cock of her own breed showed no trace of the Fantail; indeed, were telegony better established than it is, so weak a sire could hardly be expected to produce any telegonic phenomena.\n\nA similar case was the failure of the Silver chequer Homer hen, paired to a Blue chequer, to reproduce any offspring of her own colour, either directly or in the second generation, as recorded in *Nature*, June 12th, 1902, p. 157.\n\n**E. PROGRESSIVE VARIATION.**\n\nCases of a variation carrying on the line of development of a species are probably much commoner than is supposed, the attention of naturalists having hitherto been fixed rather on reversionary types than progressive ones. (*Cf.* Bateson; *Materials for the Study of Variation*, p. 307).\n\nSuch a case is the tendency to extension of the green ocellated spots in a skin of a male *Polyplectron bicalcaratum* (Malay Peacock-Pheasant) described by me recently from a skin (unfortunately a poor specimen) in the Indian Museum. (Reg. No. 21344). In this the black speckling on the upper back is in groups of spots in certain feathers, richly glossed with green, forming rudimentary ocelli in a non-ocellated region; and the black patches of the outer webs of the lower tail coverts are green-glossed to some extent, thus approaching ocelli in quite another way. (*Nature*, Vol. LXV., p. 367).\n\nAnother example is afforded by the Gold-backed Woodpecker (*Brachypternus aurantius*), whose orange-yellow back frequently shows a strong admixture of red, as I have often observed in young birds at all events. (See also Blanford, *F.B.I. Birds*, Vol. III, p. 50).\n\nThe Bronze-Cap Teal (*Eunetta falcata*), which has of late years been invading India in unusual numbers, was so common last winter 1901-1902 in the Bazaar that I secured no less than a dozen specimens, most of them females. Among these I noticed one with a strong green gloss on the head; one with a tail as purely grey as a male's, and one with a tail as distinctly barred as a female Gadwall's, there being thus two cases of progressive as against one of reversionary variation.\n\nThe dull male of the Gadwall (*Chaulelasmus streperus*) closely allied to this species, sometimes shows a green gloss on the head (see Hume; *Game-birds of India*, Vol. III, p. 186): I have never seen this myself, but have seen one with a plum-coloured gloss.\nThe peculiar Teal of the Andamans (*Nettium albigulare*) is now frequently white all over the face, whereas in Hume's time it was exceptional for the white eye-ring and white loral patch to join, and nothing is said by Count Salvadori in the *British Museum Catalogue* (Vol. XXVII., p. 257) about any extension of the white. The heads of a normal (Reg. No. 18671) and a white-faced (Reg. No. 18671) bird are figured, from a photograph, in Plate IX. The white-faced specimen was one procured as many as twelve years ago, so that the variety existed then; but it is now quite frequent, though not always so white in face as the bird figured; this specimen is a male, as also is the normal bird shown with it.\n\n**F. Variation directly induced by Confinement.**\n\nThis is not nearly so common as currently believed among ornithologists, and most of the variations which do occur among birds kept in captivity are well-known and recorded.\n\nIn male birds of the Finch family which have a carmine or pink colour in their plumage, this hue is not stable, but usually disappears after the first moult in a cage, as I have often seen.\n\nIn the Linnet (*Acanthis cannabina*) the red on head and breast leaves no trace at all; the same is the case with the Eastern race when kept in India (*A. cannabina fringillirostris*).\n\nThe Redpoll (*A. rufescens*) loses the red on the breast and rump entirely; that on the crown changes to greenish-gold.\n\nThe Rose-finch (*Carpodacus erythrinus*) changes the general carmine hue of its plumage to dull ochreous yellow.\n\nThe Sepoy-finch (*Haematospiza sipahi*) offers a curious case; it is allied to the Rose-finch, but is a brilliant scarlet, not carmine at all; yet a bird which died half through the moult in Calcutta, had changed, where the feathers had come out newly, to bright yellow.\n\nThe Bull-finch (*Pyrrhula pyrrhula*) is very liable to become dull in the red colour; and sometimes turns completely black, usually owing to a too free use of hemp-seed. But this may occur without the bird having tasted any, and also in a wild bird *(see above p. 158)*.\n\nMelanism is also common in captive Bulbuls; I have seen it in the Bengal Red-vented species (*Molpastes bengalensis*) the white-cheeked (*Otocompsa leucogenys*) and the white-eared (*Molpastes leucotis*) in which last I have seen it combined with albinism in the same individual.\n\nThe Gold-finch (*Carduelis carduelis*) kept under unfavourable conditions, is liable to have its red face become dull orange.\n\nThe Red Cardinal (*Cardinalis cardinalis*) becomes dull red if not kept out of doors in a good light; this has happened in Calcutta.\nThe common Troupial (*Icterus vulgaris*) becomes yellow from amber in confinement if the conditions are unfavourable.\n\nThe Pekin Robin (*Liothrix luteus*) is apt to fade as to its orange, yellow, and green tones in confinement; it is also liable, in the plains of India at all events, to melanism, becoming either irregularly splashed with jet-black, or regularly washed or clouded with a dark smoky hue, as if it had bathed in ink. Both these variations occurred in two birds out of about a couple of dozen kept under exactly the same conditions in Calcutta. Their companions manifested no dislike to them.\n\nThe Rosy Starling (*Pastor roseus*) in confinement in Europe fades to a dirty cream-colour; in India it gets clouded with black, black edgings appearing on the feathers. A bird of mine, deposited at the Calcutta Zoological Gardens, and treated in the same way as about a dozen others, became almost completely black. The bird was in good condition, with the plumage glossy and sleek, and the colour looked quite natural. As these birds are always quarrelling, it was not easy to make out how its companions regarded it.\n\nA pair of Striated Finches (*Uroloncha striata*) kept by a friend of mine in England in an out-door aviary many years ago became during one season heavily mottled with black all over the white belly; but they afterwards reverted to the normal colour.\n\nConversely, a Black-backed Porphyrio (*Porphyrio calvus*) at present in the Calcutta Zoological Garden has on one occasion moulted out with all the black parts mottled with white; but it has since become, and remained, black again.\n\nA male Red Dove (*Turtur tranquebaricus*) in the same garden, living under the same conditions as many others of the same species and sex, became nearly all white over the normally vinous red part of the plumage.\n\nOne of many specimens of *Turtur damarensis* brought by me to the London Zoological Garden in 1892, had last year (1901) when I saw them become very largely white in big patches.*\n\nThe male Golden Oriole (*Oriolus galbula*) of Europe, according to Bechstein, never retains its full yellow hue in confinement, but reverts to the streaky green plumage of the female.\n\nThe red summer plumage of the barred-tailed Godwit (*Limosa lapponica*) is not always assumed in confinement, for of a pair in the London Zoological Gardens last year (1901) the male was in red colour, but the female showed no sign of it.\n\n* By some accident these birds have never been registered in the Zoological Society's list, but I am quite certain about the species; I took specimens of the live Pigeons I brought home, to Count T. Salvadori who kindly identified them, being then at work on the group for the British Museum Catalogue of Birds.\nSimilarly, the adult female Scarlet Ibis (Eudocimus ruber) in the Calcutta Zoological Gardens always remain of a rich salmon-pink, while the male shows stains of scarlet in places in the spring.\n\nA young female bred in these gardens moulted out white feathers at first from her brown immature dress, whereas a young male's first adult plumage came out pink.\n\nSome of the hens kept in Calcutta, on the other hand, assume in the breeding season a goitre-like enlargement of the throat; this never occurs in the cock. The fact that the species here remains red at all is noteworthy, as in Europe it becomes very pale, getting more so at each moult, whereas our adult birds here have remained equally bright for years.\n\nThe legs of Finches which in the wild state are black, become usually fleshy white after moulting in confinement, as is well known to fanciers in the common Goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis). I find the same thing happens with the Himalayan Goldfinch (C. caniceps) when kept in Calcutta, also with the Eastern race of the Linnet (Acanthis linaria fringillirostris). The toes are first affected.\n\nG. Pathological Variation.\n\nIn the cases above-mentioned, the birds seem to be healthy, but when a bird is in poor health, certain variations present themselves which are more or less constant and definable. They may occur under domestication or in the wild state, but are naturally more frequently observed in the former case, since a sickly bird cannot survive long in nature.\n\nBaldness in certain places is very common; the lores, and in bad cases the whole space round the eye, are apt to become bald in the domestic Duck and its ancestor the Mallard, in unhealthy surroundings, as when confined in a coop. The nearly allied Spotted-bill (Anas p\u00e6cilorhyncha) does not suffer in this way, nor does any other Duck so far as I know.\n\nBaldness round the eyes also occurs in the Starling (Sturnus vulgaris) and sometimes in the Rosy Starling (Pastor roseus). In the latter species I have seen one or two birds affected while the rest, treated in exactly the same way, were exempt. The head of a tamed specimen of the Jungle Mynah (\u00c6thiopsar fuscus), which has become bald-faced while living at perfect liberty, is figured below. The resemblance to the normal state of affairs in the adult Rook (Corvus frugilegus), is obvious, and suggests a hereditary incapacity to retain the facial plumage in that species.\nHEAD OF JUNGLE MYNAH, ABNORMALLY BARE IN FACE.\n\nThe rump becomes bald in many birds, and the tail-coverts and lesser wing-coverts drop out.\n\nBaldness over the whole head frequently occurs in caged birds; and I have seen it in a wild House Mynah (Acridotheres tristis) more than once. In this case the whole bare skin of the head was bright yellow like the skin round the eye, which is normally bare in this species.\n\nIn caged House-Mynahs in England (but not in India) I have seen this circum-ocular skin faded to white, while the bill and feet remained yellow. The white facial skin characterizes the young bird naturally.\n\nA Cassowary (Casuarius galeatus) at the London Zoological Gardens last year (1901) showed a large amount of irregular naked skin on the back, which was coloured pink and blue, in faint imitation of the hues of the bare head and neck. In a Cassowary which recently died at the Calcutta Zoological Garden I found to my surprise that the skin on the body was dull white like human skin.\n\nThe overgrowth of the bill, claws, and scales of the shank is pathological; and is not necessarily due to old age or absence of wear, which cannot affect the scales of the shank. I have seen a Canary become very scaly-legged in its second year, while another, ten years old, had feet and legs as smooth as a bird of the year.\n\nThe feathers frequently become more or less reverted, as in frizzled fowls, in wild gallinaceous birds kept entirely under cover; this I have seen in India in several species of Pheasants and Quails. In one case a single hen Pheasant (the species was Phasianus torquatus) was affected, while a cock and several other hens, kept under the same conditions, were not.\n\nH. SPONTANEOUS VARIATION UNDER DOMESTICATION.\n\nWhile Darwin has very fully and completely gone into the question of the extent of the modifications which can be effected by selective breeding, little attention seems to have been paid to the range of spontaneous variation in birds under domestication, the material, in fact, on\nwhich breeders have had to work. I shall therefore take a number of domestic or protected species in detail, and discuss the colour-variations to which each appears to be subject without the intervention of selection.\n\nThe Canary (Serinus serinus canaria). Dr. Bowdler Sharpe in The British Museum Catalogue of Birds, treats the Wild Canary of the Atlantic islands as an insular form of the European Serin Finch (Serinus serinus); it differs from this continental bird in darker colouration and longer tail. It varies much when not bred systematically.\n\nBirds of the wild colour, called green in the fancy, are common; they are often mistaken by people not well-acquainted with Canaries for Mules or hybrids. They are the strongest in constitution. Yellow birds or lutinos are, as is well known, the commonest. They may be either \"buff,\" i.e., pale whitish yellow, or \"yellow,\" which is bright yellow. If \"yellow\" birds are continually paired, the offspring is scanty in feather.\n\nA pallid form is not rare, in which the plumage is pale brown with slightly darker streaks; this is the \"cinnamon\" of the fancy. Once I have seen specimens of a dark brown form among common singing Canaries in England. These birds, although undoubtedly pure-bred Canaries, showed in one or two instances no trace of green or yellow, being simply warm brown with dark streaks, and looking rather like hen linnets. White canaries have recently been bred. (Feathered World, June 13th, 1902, p. 1039.)\n\nI have read of grey forms, but have never seen any such. Pied birds are very common; the marking is commonly asymmetrical. The parts most prone to exhibit dark feathers in light-pied birds are the secondary quills, feathers round the eye, and two outer tail-feathers. Dark-pied birds run to white in the tail. Cinnamons may be pied, but no gradation seems to occur between cinnamon and green.\n\nI have once or twice seen green birds among Chinese specimens with the central part of the quills and tail marked with yellow as in the Greenfinch. A male Green Canary I once knew for several years began to show yellow about the head with advancing age.\n\nThe bills and feet of Canaries are horny in the green, and fleshy-white in the light-coloured types. The retention of the dark colour in the legs is noteworthy, considering the evanescence of this in wild-caught captive Finches of other species.\n\nIn view of the variability of the tame Canary, the following opposite instances in allied Finches are interesting:\n\nMr. G. C. Swailes (Avicultural Magazine, Vol. I., 1894-95, p. 118) gives his experience with the Twite in confinement (Acanthis flavirostris). A pied cock, about half-white, and a pure white hen, being paired, produced five young; the only two reared were both normally coloured.\n\"This\" says Mr. Swailes, \"I expected, as I have reared a large number during the past few years from both white, pied, and cinnamon Lesser Red-polls, and have in-bred them, but have never had one vary in the least from the normal colour.\"\n\nThe Java Sparrow (Munia oryzivora) of the East-Indian Archipelago has long been domesticated in Japan, and tame and wild specimens are now both commonly kept as cage-birds. It is not a variable bird in its wild state; I have never seen any variation in wild birds of the species, nor has Mr. W. Rutledge in his very large experience.\n\nThe tame-bred Japanese birds may either be pure white or pied with the normal colour. The dark colouring in this case is confined to the upper plumage as a rule, but is not very regular. The head is almost always pure white, and the tail also. The bill, feet, and eyelids are normal. Dr. A. G. Butler, who has bred the white variety, found that a young bird he reared was grey above till its first moult; paired with a normally coloured cock (which it did not desert for white ones) it produced two young like its own first plumage, one like a young wild bird, and two intermediate, all in the same brood. (Foreign Finches in Captivity, p. 262).\n\nMr. F. Groser, who has also bred both forms in Calcutta, tells me that they kept distinct whenever they could find mates of their own colour.\n\nThe tame white birds are larger and stronger than the wild type. They are more phlegmatic, but also more spiteful; the small sexual distinction, in the stouter and larger head and bill of the male, is more marked. The song of the white birds is quite different, according to Dr. Butler.\n\nThe Sharp-tailed Finch (Uroloncha acuticauda) of Eastern Asia has also long been domesticated in Japan, and its tame forms are the \"Bengalee\" of English fanciers. Dr. A. G. Butler, who in his Foreign Finches in Captivity beautifully figures the three tame varieties, considers with the late J. Abrahams that this little domestic Finch originated in a cross between the Striated Finch (Uroloncha striata) and the Indian Silver-bill (Aidemosyne malaharica). I cannot agree with this, as my observation of these birds leads me to conclude they are simply derivatives of the Sharp-tailed Finch (Uroloncha acuticauda); I have never seen one resembling the Silver-bill or the Striated Finch, and all three species are well known to me in life as well as in the skin. The late Dr. K. Russ, the greatest authority on small birds in captivity, gave Uroloncha acuticauda as the ancestor of the domestic bird. Some tame forms resemble the type, but they are generally pied with white, the amount of this colour varying from a few white feathers to complete\nwhiteness. The pied markings are irregular and unnatural-looking. There is a cinnamon form, showing the markings of the dark-brown type on a fawn-coloured ground. This is generally pied with white, grading, as the dark-pied birds do, into complete whiteness, and pied irregularly like them.\n\nPure white birds are less common than pied ones, but more so than dark-brown typical or pure cinnamon birds.\n\nThere is no intergradation between the brown and cinnamon forms.\n\nThe bill and legs vary as in the Canary; they are normally coloured in normal or nearly normal types, fleshy white in cinnamon, white, and light-pied forms. The upper chap may be black and the lower fleshy white, in correspondence with the head-marking.\n\nThe cinnamon and white forms are smaller than the dark-brown ones.\n\n**The Collared Dove (Turtur risorius).** The exact origin of the domestic Turtle-dove is unknown; its varieties are of three types. The ordinary form is creamy-fawn with drab primaries and white tips to the tail-feathers except the central pair; a half-collar on the nape and the proximal half of all the tail-feathers below are black. The bill is black, the iris red, the feet purple-red, and the eyelids creamy-white. The sexes are similar, though the cocks are almost imperceptibly lighter about the head. The young have no distinct collar, have fleshy-coloured bills and paler red feet. This form does not vary more than a wild bird, and English- and Indian-bred specimens are alike.\n\nThere is also a white form with a flesh-coloured bill and paler red eyes; the pupil is often red (non-pigmented) in these. This may have a dark collar, but is generally without it.\n\nThere is an intermediate form, coloured generally as in the common type, but with the primaries white, collar drab, all tail feathers white but the two central, which are buff, and grey at base of tail below instead of black. The bill in this form is flesh-coloured and the irides light red as in the white birds. I have only seen this in India.\n\nMr. D. Ezra, to whom I showed birds of this intermediate form tells me he got somewhat similar birds by crossing the white and black-collared fawn types. He is sure they were not pied or splashed as Pigeons often are.\n\nI have seen in cages of these Doves specimens of a drab colour with dark ring, identical in plumage with the wild *T. douraca* of India, but in the absence of opportunities of studying these individuals I cannot say whether they were tame or wild specimens; I think the latter.\n\n**The Rock-Pigeon (Columba livia and intermedia)** has been so long bred selectively that it is not a good species on which to study\nspontaneous variation, since it is hard to find it in a really unselected state. Both the Western and Eastern forms produce chequered individuals when wild.\n\nBy studying Pigeons not selected for colour, or living in a semi-feral state, as in towns where they pick up their living in the streets, the following leading types are evident:\n\n(a) As in wild type; common, but not the most numerous.\n\n(b) Silver, a pallid form, greyish cream-colour with the wing-bars and tail-tip dark drab; bill flesh-colour. Not uncommon. Correct for many breeds.\n\n(c) Blue-chequer, with the back and wing-coverts mottled with black; very common, in fact the most numerous in semi-feral pigeons, and also occurring frequently among birds in a perfectly wild state.\n\n(d) Silver-chequer, the corresponding marking in cream and drab.\n\n(e) A sandy-red form with grayish white primaries, rump and tail; very common. Often the wings are chequered with whitish, when the bird is a red chequer.\n\n(f) Silver-dun; a sort of ashy-grey, with dark-reddish-brown neck and wing-bars; no tail-bar; very common.\n\n(g) Black, of a dull slaty shade, very common.\n\n(h) Pure white; rare.\n\nIntermediate pied and splashed forms are numerous, generally asymmetrical; the quills and tail are often more or less white, or again may be markedly darker than the body when this is or white. In this case the marking is symmetrical, but ill-defined. Blue and black, blue and blue chequer, and blue chequer and black, grade into each other commonly; but not, as a rule at all events, any of the blue shades with red or silver; nor do these last grade into black as a rule.\n\nThe beak is fleshy-white in light forms, the feet and eyes remaining normal, except in whites, where the eyes are dark (\"bull\" of the fancy).\n\nThe pigeon certainly shows convincingly what can be done by careful selection of structural variations, for in its feral state it is not by any means a structurally variable bird. In form a lot of feral pigeons are as uniform as most wild birds, and much more so than some species.\n\n**The Budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus).** This little Australian Parrakeet, known in books as the Undulated Grass-Parrakeet, has been exported only during the last half-century, and many are still brought over; but it is largely bred in captivity.\n\nIn domestication the usual colour is the typical one, but three varietal forms occur.\nOne is a pallid form, of a general greenish-yellow tint with the dark markings faintly indicated; the blue cheek spots are present in full development. I have seen at least five of this form.\n\nAnother is a pure lutino, clear uniform yellow throughout, with pink eyes. I have seen two of this type.\n\nTwo blue specimens, in each case the offspring of yellow birds, have been known. (J. Abrahams, vide Mr. R. Phillipps, Avicultural Magazine, Vol. VIII., 1902, p. 75.)\n\nOne or other of the first two is being fixed by breeders, but I cannot say to which form the \"Yellow Budgerigars\" so often advertised belong. I have seen no pied, splashed, or otherwise intermediate forms.\n\nThe Blue Mountain Lorikeet (Trichoglossus swainsoni) was bred yearly for about four years previous to 1890, at the Blackpool Aquarium and Menagerie, according to Mr. W. Osbaldeston (Avicultural Magazine, Vol. VIII., p. 167, 1902). Mr. Osbaldeston, after giving an account of the conditions under which the birds were kept, says \"One year a very curious, handsome, 'sportively' plumaged bird was reared. The head was red with lacings of white, and the shoulders were tinted with green. The greater portions of all other parts of wings, body, and tail were of a bright chrome yellow, intermixed with green feathers here and there; and the tail feathers were tipped with red; making a really handsome, showy, and rare bird. It was a young bird in May 1891, and was alive some three years afterwards to my knowledge. I went many times to look at and admire this rare-feathered Lorikeet. . . On one occasion, I noticed that its claws had grown very long. It was always kept in the same cage with the others.\"\n\nThe Pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) has been more or less artificially cared for ever since the time of the Romans, and so may be fairly reckoned a protected bird. Its variations fall into two main types:\n\nThe pallid \"Bohemian\" form, in which the cock's ground-colour is a lustreless buff, with the usual dark edgings to the feathers and dark neck almost devoid of gloss. I can find no account of the hen.\n\nThe white form, which is found in both sexes.\n\nIntermediates between Bohemian and normal seem not to occur. White-pied birds are common; the white marking is irregular and mostly confined to the upper surface. Pied birds will produce their like if paired, and will give some pied offspring with normal birds; but a white and a normal bird will not usually produce pieds, though some whites may be bred from such a mating. (Tegetmeier, Pheasants for Coverts and Aviaries, 3rd edition, 1897, p. 150).\n\nWhite specimens are weaker than normal.\nThe Golden Pheasant (Chrysolophus pictus) of China has been bred in confinement over a century.\n\nIt is generally true to the type, but a variety, the Black-throated Gold Pheasant, is known (C. pictus obscurus of Schlegel) in which the cock's cheeks and throat are dark brown instead of buff, and the scapulars blackish instead of bright red, while all the tail-feathers are barred, the central ones with the rest. The hen of this form is darker than that of the type, as also are the chicks. It is believed to be a variation which has arisen in captivity, as it is only known in that state.\n\nAs the Amherst Pheasant (C. amherstiae) the only near relative of the Golden species, has a dark throat and barred central tail-feathers, the peculiarities of this form seem to be more probably due to a reversion to the ancestral type of the genus than to an approach to melanism.\n\nMr. P. Castang, the well-known wild-fowl dealer of Leadenhall market, tells me that this variety used to be more common, but was not liked, on account of its dull appearance.\n\nThe Silver Pheasant (Gennaeus nycthemerus) has given no variations in captivity.\n\nThe Fowl (Gallus gallus) is obviously excessively variable in colouration. As I showed some time ago (Nature, Jan. 30, 1902, p. 297) the characteristic colours of all except the highly specialized pencilled, laced and spangled breeds occur in common Indian Bazaar fowls.\n\nI stated on this occasion that the colouration of rufous with a black tail was not recognized as correct for any breed in hens, but in making this statement I overlooked the Nankeen Bantam breed, in which both sexes are thus coloured. This colouration is perhaps the commonest met with in domestic poultry allowed to interbreed freely.\n\nA few more details may here be added:\n\nThe colour of the legs and feet in unselected fowls varies much, being fleshy-white, blue-grey, black, yellow, or olive-green (\"willow\" of the fancy). The only intermediate form which occurs is the black-mottled white or yellow accepted for Houdans and Anconas respectively.\n\nThe ear-lobe, as in the wild bird, varies from red to white; it may present a combination of the two colours. Creamy-yellow ear-lobes also occur. The ear-lobe is blue in the dark-skinned \"Silky\" breed.\n\nThe bill is dark as in the wild bird except in birds which have white or yellow legs, in which case the bill is of the same colour, sometimes marked along the ridge with black.\n\nThe naked skin of the comb and face, &c., is uniformly red as a rule, whereas the wild-bird's face is flesh-coloured. A dark purple face may occur, as in the Brown-Red Game, which is hence called\n\"gipsy-faced.\" The whole skin, as is well-known, is dark in the Silky breed, as is also in this case the periosteum of the bones. This breed has white plumage, but usually dark-faced fowls are dark-feathered also. I have never seen a dark-faced cock in India except, of course, a \"Silky.\"\n\nThe comb in mongrel fowls is usually single; but rose-combs often occur, and pea-combs less commonly. The single comb is always larger than in the Jungle-fowl, and higher and more arched in outline in the cocks. The wattles are also larger, and are developed in the hens, which is not usually the case in the wild bird. Small crests and a muff of feathers on the throat occur in mongrel fowls of both sexes, but not together as a rule. Tame hens are also often spurred, which is rarely the case in the Jungle-fowl, though Blyth obtained such a specimen. The legs and feet are always larger and coarser in tame fowls than in wild, and the tail is carried more erect.\n\nThe wattles may be occasionally aborted, and a median dewlap take their place. This tends to be the case in the Indian Aseel or fighting-cock; and in two fighting-cocks of a larger breed, from Saigon, I saw at Mr. Rutledge's establishment some time back, not only were the wattles absent and replaced by a dewlap, but there were no earlobes either. Their combs were small and non-serrated, and as the neck and head were all bare and red, the general appearance strikingly recalled that of a Condor (Sarcorhamphus gryphus).\n\nThe Peacock (Pavo cristatus) varies at times in its wild state in India. Mr. Hume (Game-birds and Wild-fowl of India, Vol. I., p. 89) records, on Sanderson's authority, two hens of a dirty yellow. Mr. W. Rutledge once received a cock of the colour of a new copper coin, as he described it.\n\nMost tame Peafowl conform to the ordinary wild type.\n\nWhite specimens are not rare, with fleshy-white bills and feet. Pied specimens are also not uncommon; the colouration, though not quite regular, and unlike a natural marking, follows certain rules, the neck, primary quills and belly being white, and the rest of the plumage coloured.\n\nMost important of all is the Japan or Black-winged form (Pavo nigripennis of Sclater) in which the male has all the wing, except the primaries, black, glossed at the edges with blue and green; the primaries are chestnut with clouding of black along the shaft and edge. The thighs are also black in this form, and the train more glossed with copper than in the type. The hen in this variety is white with the upper surface grizzled with black, and longitudinal central black splashes on the rump-feathers; the tail is black, and the primaries chestnut as in the male.\n\nThe feet are fleshy-white in both sexes.\nThe young are all white in the down and first feather, with a pink flush on the wings; but the young cocks soon become dark. The variety has been abundantly shown by Darwin to arise in either sex as a sport from the type in domestication; it seems in one instance to have occurred wild. It is smaller and weaker than typical birds, and not a match for them; yet when they are allowed to interbreed indiscriminately the black-winged form swamps the other. Mr. Castang tells me that black-winged birds will throw back to the type, but generally speaking the variety breeds true.\n\nThe Guinea-fowl (*Numida meleagris*), although so recently domesticated, varies a great deal. I have discussed the colour-variations in *Nature* (June 5th, 1902, p. 126). Since then I have seen two or three of a type I had only previously seen in one pied bird, i.e., lavender without spots. I find self-coloured birds of this type have barred primaries like the dark-purplish self-coloured birds.\n\nMr. L. Wright (*loc. cit. infra*) says that pied birds are the result of crossing white and coloured specimens.\n\nThere is also a form with white ground-colour and dark spots, but this I have never seen. (*L. Wright's Illustrated Book of Poultry*, Cassell & Co., 1890, p. 511). In all the forms the white of the lower cheeks invades most of the sides of the head and neck; and in most birds, even the normally coloured ones, the toes and more or less of the shanks are orange yellow. The white of the face also often invades the wattles, and both these and the face may be stained with blue.\n\nThe loose naked skin of the throat is much more developed in Indian than in English Guinea-fowls, often forming a dewlap an inch deep, and frequently coloured a bright sky-blue instead of dull purple.\n\nI procured some time ago a normally-coloured male specimen with a pendulous throat-tuft of feathers coloured like the adjacent feathered part of the neck, of a plain purplish-slate.\n\nThe Turkey (*Meleagris gallopavo*) of Mexico was found domesticated when the Spaniards invaded America, and very soon was kept in Europe. It has not been bred selectively till lately.\n\nThe colour-variations in domestication are few and well-defined. The typical bronze form is not very common in Europe; and in India I have only seen it once in seven years' residence. This bird in colour exactly resembled the plate of this species in Elliot's *Monograph of the Phasianid\u00e6*. The commonest type is one in which the bronze part of the plumage is replaced by black, bronze only in certain lights, the brown and white markings being retained.\n\nThe pure black form is also not uncommon.\nA white form with the body and tail-feathers subterminally barred with black in a very regular manner is not infrequent; the primaries in this are smoky-black on the inner and white on the outer web, not barred as one would expect. Pure white, fawn, and grey varieties occur in Europe, but apparently not in India.\n\nThe legs of dark forms of domestic birds are horn-colour, not pink as in the wild bird; in light forms they are pinky-white.\n\nThe occurrence of a downy crest in tame Turkeys has been discussed by Darwin; I have never come across an instance.\n\nThe tame Turkey shows a distinct increase in the size of the naked head processes and carunculations as compared with the wild bird; and the tame Turkeys of India, as Blyth long ago remarked, similarly show a marked increase of development of these parts as compared with European domestic specimens.\n\nThe feet are also coarser than in the wild bird.\n\nThe Mute Swan (Cygnus olor) of Central Europe and Asia has been tame for many centuries in Europe, but has practically lived the life of a wild bird, largely shifting for itself, and often, when left unpinioned, reverting to the wild state, so that its exact natural range is doubtful.\n\nThe species has continued true to type except for the production of one well-marked variety:\n\nThe Polish Swan (Cygnus immutabilis of Yarrell). In this the plumage is white at all ages; and the nestling-down is white. The feet are flesh- or clay-coloured instead of black, and the frontal knob is smaller. Sometimes the cygnets are fawn-coloured in this form.\n\nThe variety is known to be propagated truly for at least one generation. It has occurred in a wild or feral condition, and has been bred from the ordinary type both in England and of late years on the continent.\n\nIntermediate forms occur, for the characters are not sufficiently constant to allow of this type ranking as a species, to say nothing of its origin. Those few specimens which I have seen were, however, all readily recognizable and typical. The variation is not recorded to be at all sexually limited.\n\nThe Muscovy Duck (Cairina moschata) of Tropical America, was, like the Turkey, found in a domesticated state by the Spaniards, but it also exists wild.\n\nDomestic birds are often nearly true to the wild type, but seldom completely so, as they usually show a few white feathers about the head. The head and upper neck are often grizzled throughout with black and white, ending very definitely, while the rest of the body remains normal.\n\nPied birds are common, the black being usually mostly restricted to the crest, back, and tail, but the marking is not very regular. The\nprimaries are always white in pied birds. A variety with white body and black crest occurs, and has been fixed as the \"Peruvian\" breed.\n\nA slate-grey variety occurs, but is rare.\n\nPure black and pure white specimens are not uncommon.\n\nThe bill and feet in the latter are pale sickly yellow, and the irides light blue, instead of the usual orange-brown.\n\nThe bill and feet remain normal in most birds, but the terminal portion of the toes and webs are often pale yellow in pied birds, the rest of the limb remaining normal. The bare face of the drake varies much in extent and development, being either moderate and smooth, or excessively carunculated. It is sometimes nearly all black instead of red, even in white birds. The duck has the bare face and carunculations like the drake, but on a smaller scale, and the development varies similarly.\n\nThe form is often heavy and clumsy, but the birds can generally fly, and often display a strong perching instinct.\n\nThe Grey-Lag Goose (Anser ferus) of the temperate parts of the Old World is the oldest of all domesticated birds, a white tame variety having been known in the days of Homer. It is unusually variable in the wild state, according to Mr. Hume (Game Birds of India, Vol. III., pp. 63, 64). I have not noticed the variations he mentions, the comparatively few birds I have seen having been very uniform, but I have several times seen a slight difference of colour which he does not appear to have found, viz., the nail of the bill being horn-coloured instead of white. Mr. J. G. Millais (Wild-fowler in Scotland, p. 31) records a white Grey-lag which for four winters frequented the Tay Valley with others of its species\u2014thison the authority of a Mr. C. M. Innes, who ultimately wounded but lost it.\n\nThis goose has varied very little in colour, presenting only the following types:\n\n(a) Resembling the wild form; correct for Toulouse breed.\n\n(b) Silver-grey; only known as a sport in Toulouse ganders. The case, as reported by a well-known water-fowl breeder, Mr. J. K. Fowler, in Mr. L. Wright's Illustrated Book of Poultry (Cassell & Co., 1890), p. 559, is so important that it may be given in full:\u2014\"Some time ago I bought for a change of blood a fine gander from a celebrated fancier, which differed from my own strain in colour, being of a beautiful silver-grey instead of dark like my own, though otherwise the markings were exactly similar. I bred from him that year some splendid stock, which all took after their maternal relatives in colour with one exception, consisting of a gander, which came of exactly the same hue as his sire. Since that time, in each succeeding year, I find one or two\u2014seldom\nmore\u2014come silver-grey; and strange to say, they are always ganders, and generally remarkably fine, and superior to their brothers. I have never yet bred a single goose of this lighter shade.\"\n\n(c) Pure white, correct for Embden and Sebastopol breeds.\n\n(d) Sandy-coloured; never seen by me. \"Sandy-coloured (common) geese are not infrequent in some parts.\" (Rev. Dr. Goodacre on The Question of the Identity of Species of the Common Domestic and the Chinese Goose, P.Z.S., 1879, p. 711.)\n\nThe bill and feet in all tame birds are usually orange, but still a good many have flesh-coloured feet. The irides are dark except in white or light-pied birds, wherein they are blue.\n\nPied intermediates are common, ranging from white-quilled birds to the more common type of white body with grey neck and head, patch on back, and one on each flank. Ganders are almost always white in rough-bred geese; seldom grey, and still more seldom pied.\n\nMr. Hewitt found that in crossing the Embden and Toulouse, for which he preferred females of the latter and a male of the former, that the goslings came \"saddle-backed\" in the feather, with the head and upper portion of the neck grey, and a patch of the same colour on the thighs, the whole of the remainder of the plumage being white. Singularly enough, the majority of the young ganders and a fair proportion of the geese thus bred are slightly crested, though this peculiarity is not possessed by either parent.\" (Cassell's Illustrated Book of Poultry, p. 562.) Tame geese are much heavier in build than wild, but can fly.\n\nThe Pink-footed Goose (Anser brachyrhynchos) produces a variety with the feet and band across the bill orange instead of pink in the wild state (see Sir R. Payne-Gallwey, Letters to Young Shooters, p. 69, foot-note). The same variation occurs in semi-domestication.\n\nMr. Cecil Smith, in Mr. H. E. Dresser's Birds of Europe (pp. 71, 72, published 1878), writes:\n\n\"My original pair were perfectly true Pink-footed Geese, there being no suspicion of orange about the bill or legs and feet of either; the colour on these parts, however, became very pale and faded after the breeding-season, and continued so long into the autumn, but towards the end of autumn it got much brighter, the colour being most intense at the beginning of the breeding-season; it is the same with those of their young which have orange legs and bills. This pair hatched three young in 1872; of these only one reached maturity. The legs and bills of the young were all alike, very dark olive-green, showing no trace of pink as long as they were in the down; but soon after they began to assume their feathers the colour on the legs and bills began to disclose itself, and those parts in the only survivor of this brood were\nand still are orange. Since then the old ones have bred every year, some of the young having orange legs and bills, and some pink like their parents. This year the first orange-legged one, a female, had a brood, some of which had orange and some pink bills and legs. I have never seen any mixture of the colours, the legs and bill being either bright orange or bright pink; there seems to be no gradation between the two. As to the bills, the dark portion (that is, the nail and the base) remains the same whether the other part is orange or pink; in fact, the only part of the bill that shows any change is the part which in the Pink-footed Goose is usually pink.\"\n\nThe Chinese Goose (*Cygnopsis cygnoides*) of Eastern Asia has long been domesticated in China and has been known as a tame bird in Europe for more than a century.\n\nThis Goose as usually seen in England shows two varieties. One in which the colour of the wild type is preserved throughout, and a pure white type, with bill as well as feet orange. I do not remember seeing intermediate pied forms, which no doubt occur.\n\nThe bill is shorter than in the wild type, and at the base there is a fleshy knob, level with the forehead above, and noticeably better-developed in the male. The form is of course heavier than would be the case in a wild bird.\n\nThe species can be modified to a greater extent, for the large Swallow breed, while typical in colour, has a very large knob, a pendulous feathered dewlap and abdominal fold.\n\nA smaller lighter breed is imported to India from China, inferior in size to the type and much darker and greyer in colour, with the feet as well as the bill black, only just tinged with orange. There is no gular or abdominal flap, but the frontal knob is well developed, and the beak short.\n\nThe geese kept in India were considered by Blyth to be hybrids between the Chinese and the common goose, but so far as I have seen they show, in colour at all events, no trace of the latter. Their colour is not very often completely normal, as they frequently show some orange at the base of the beak, a white band of feathers round the base of the upper mandible, and a more or less perfect white belt across the breast. White birds are as described above. Pied birds are common, and usually have the dark colour on the back, flanks, and head. They are just as often ganders as geese, so that white is not sexually limited in this race.\n\nThe nasal knob is never very large, and grades into complete absence. Two young specimens imported direct from China, and normally coloured, had each a small round tuft at the back of the head.\nThe Mallard (*Anas boschas*) of the Northern Hemisphere has been domesticated since the beginning of the Christian era, and has given rise to several distinct breeds. It varies to some extent when wild, and a great deal in an unselected condition, as when kept in India; the varieties are best considered separately as to sex.\n\nThe leading variations in drakes are as follows:\n\n(a) As in wild type; rare; correct for Rouen breed.\n\n(b) As above, but no bay breast or white collar, the pencilled-grey of the under-surface running up to the green neck; common; said to supervene with old age in domesticated birds of recent wild stock.\n\n(c) As in wild type, but bay of breast running cloudily along flanks; common.\n\n(d) Black with a white patch on breast.\n\n(e) Blue grey but with the usual markings; breast warm brown.\n\n(f) Pure white; correct for Aylesbury, White Call, and Pekin breeds, the last-named being tinged with yellow.\n\nIntermediate types are very common, generally irregularly marked; the breast is the first part to show abnormal white feathering, then the wings. I have never seen a pure black duck among mongrel Indian birds.\n\nOne pied type recurs so frequently, in various colours, that it deserves special mention. In this the head, breast and shoulders, and hinder part of body are coloured, the rest white. This is the correct marking for the new Indian Runner breed, in which the coloured part of the plumage must be fawn in tint.\n\nAs in the fowl, the female varies more than the male:\n\n(a) As in wild type; rare.\n\n(b) As above, but light and dark head-markings obsolete, all head being uniformly speckled; speculum often whitish or brown like rest of wing.\n\n(c) As in wild type, but lighter; throat and eyebrows white, belly shading into white; speculum normal; common.\n\n(d) As in wild type, but ground-colour much darker, rich warm brown, correct for female of Rouen breed; common.\n\n(e) Black with white patch on breast; speculum often whitish; common.\n\n(f) Blue-grey, often with dark edgings to the feather; not uncommon.\n\n(g) Pure white; correct for Aylesbury and other white breeds.\n\n(h) White, with coloured speculum and some dark colour on rest of wings. Drakes are never marked like this.\n\nThe intermediate types are very numerous; the markings in pied\nducks are the same as in pied drakes, which is remarkable when the great natural difference between the sexes is considered. For instance, the type with white neck, wings, and belly, and coloured head, breast and stern, corresponds closely with the drake so marked, and is correct for the female of Indian Runners.\n\nThe colour of the bill varies much; the iris, however, is not noticeably variable, being always dark as in the wild form. The legs and feet are always orange except in black and dark black-pied birds, where they are black or black with orange toes respectively; I have also seen some light brown types with dark olive feet, in females. The female's beak is extremely variable, usually a mixture of orange and black in varying proportions; but it may be black-and-slate in the darker and some of the lighter types. In white birds it is generally orange, but should be fleshy white in the Aylesbury, a colour not seen in Indian mongrels.\n\nThe drake's bill varies much as the duck's, being most commonly yellow or orange, often pied with black at the ridge and base. I never saw dark olive legs in a drake; except in black or black-pied birds they are always orange. The legs and general form are always coarse.\n\nThe Ostrich (Struthio camelus) has been domesticated for thirty years in Cape Colony (Mr. C. Schreiner, Zoologist, 4th series, Vol. I., 1897, pp. 99, 100).\n\nAn abrupt variation occurs in the colour of the naked skin, which is fleshy in some individuals, and grey of a dark or light shade in others. This difference of skin colouration is the main point relied upon to distinguish the various wild races now ranked as species. The plumage of the cocks varies from jet-black to rusty brown, the latter hue predominating in the moister coast districts. They may be more or less spotted with white, and in some the body feathers are curled. The hens vary from dark rich brown to light brown, grey, or ash; they may have wing and tail-plumes white, or be barred with white; and a male-plumaged specimen was in Mr. Schreiner's possession.\n\nI. MORAL VARIABILITY.\n\nVariation in disposition is very familiar to bird fanciers, and as examples I may perhaps be allowed to detail some observations I made recently on two members of the Babbler group (Timeliidae or Crateropodidae) the Red-billed Liothrix (Liothrix luteus) and the striated Reed-Babbler (Argya earlii).\n\nI had a couple of dozen of the former and one of the latter in a large cage together. Before the Babbler had been many days in the cage I began to notice the Liothrix often tickling and scratching its head, as\nthey habitually do to each other, but the recipient of this kind attention did not try to return it.\n\nAfter a little time I introduced eight more Reed-Babblers into the cage, six adults and two young birds. They fraternized with each other and the other member of their species, but before long I had to remove one bird, a young one, for bullying the Liothrix. Twice I caught it holding a Liothrix by the nape and keeping it suspended in the air as it perched, in one case the victim losing many of its feathers on escaping. It also drove the Liothrix from the food in sheer wantonness, whereas the other Babblers displayed no such selfish spirit. The bird was amicable enough with members of its own species. The Liothrix bore no grudge against these for the bad behaviour of their compatriot, for after its removal I saw one of them caressing one of the remaining Reed-Babblers in the usual way. But I never saw these take any trouble to return the compliment, any more than did the solitary individual. However, I did not long keep them in the company of smaller birds.\n\nThe Liothrix itself varies in temperament, although usually to be described as tame though nervous, harmless and good-natured; of the two dozen birds alluded to, one, a fine male with a large stout bill and somewhat clouded with black below (A) was inquisitive, always coming near me when I approach the cage; but he would not usually take food from my fingers. He was fonder of seed than any of the rest, and was not mischievous, though well able to hold his own. The others did not dislike him on account of his colour variation, unsightly as it was. Very likely his fondness for seed was responsible for the change.\n\nAnother bird (B) also a male, with a very short bill, was tame, would feed from the fingers, and was slightly inclined to be mischievous. When I put in an unfledged Paradise Flycatcher (Terpsiphone paradisi), this specimen made several attempts to pull it off the perch by the tail. B was not spiteful, but A, in spite of his bigger beak, was afraid of him.\n\nA third male (C) normally coloured, with largish bill, was very tame, alighted on a food tray while I had it in my hand, and would peck from my fingers. It pecked several times at the head of the young Flycatcher above alluded to, and also bullied a young Tailorbird (Orthotomus sutorius) I put in experimentally. The second bird mentioned made no attempt to molest this little creature, in spite of his inhospitable behaviour towards the Flycatcher a few days previously. Nor did most of the other specimens touch either young bird, so that the interference was unusual in this species. On one occasion I saw C mischievously jerking and pulling B by the tail, while another was combing B's feathers.\nHere, then, we have in two species of the same natural group considerable variation in disposition, both individual and specific.\n\nJ. Variation in Mental Powers.\n\nIt is familiar to bird-fanciers that some individuals of a species learn to speak or sing with greater facility than others.\n\nIn talking Hill-Mynahs (*Eulabes intermedia*) and Parrots of various species everyone must have noticed how few specimens can clearly enunciate words. I have only seen two of the above Mynahs which I should call good talkers, and one of these was more perfect than the other.\n\nSex may be supposed to make some difference, but two out of the only three clearly-speaking Parrots I have known were females; these were a red-and-yellow Macaw (*Ara macao*) and a common Ring-necked Indian Parrakeet (*Psittornis torquatus*). The other was an African grey Parrot (*Psittacus erithacus*) whose sex I do not know.\n\nI also noticed in a brood of young Cormorants (*Phalacrocorax javanicus*) I reared some years ago, that one was so tame that I could carry it about on my hand, while another was so wild and vicious that it was difficult to handle it at all.\n\nTwo young Bayas or Weavers (*Ploceus atrigula*) which I recently reared varied exceedingly in intellectual powers. Both were confiding, but one was also nervous and stupid, dashing off in aimless flights, and when coming to me settling sometimes on my nose; while the other's excursions were much more purposeful, and it would freely alight on my head or shoulder, or on those of others, hardly ever trying to settle on the face.\n\nK. Variation in Taste.\n\nA few instances of special preferences or the reverse in diet seem worth recording.\n\nMr. Meldrum of this city tells me that a Bhimraj (*Dissemurus paradiseus*) in his possession will not eat cockroaches; the specimens I have kept have usually done so readily, although supplied, as his bird is, with other insects.\n\nI have noted above (p. 179) in one Liothrix (*L. luteus*) out of two dozen kept under the same conditions, a strong appetite for canary-seed. I have heard of a pair which ultimately killed themselves by too much indulgence in this article of food, although they had a choice.\n\nSexual variations in taste have been fully dealt with by Darwin, and it is plain that individual inclination to breed outside the species frequently occurs. (*Descent of Man*, 2nd edition, 1899, pp. 414, 415).\n\nThe aversion to particular males, however, often alluded to, is very\nprobably due in many cases to the male in question not being strong enough to coerce a refractory female. Darwin mentions this (Descent of Man, second edition, 1899, p. 417) with regard to the fowl; and in the case of the Pigeon and Canary, the more frequent occurrence of the phenomenon seems to be connected with the greater equality of the sexes.\n\nI once witnessed a case in which a male domestic collared dove (Turtur risorius) confined in a hutch with a recently wild caught Turtle-dove (T. auritus) female, bullied the unfortunate bird till she was nearly scalped, with the result that ultimately she laid, although no young were hatched from the eggs.\n\nHad she been the stronger bird, this would certainly not have happened; I have seen a female Muscovy duck repulse ignominiously a male common drake which tried to pair with her.\n\nThe converse case, of a cock strongly objecting to a particular hen, has been recently recorded with the fowl by (Bateson, Royal Society Reports to the Evolution Committee, I., 1902, p. 100).\n\nL. Variation in Habits.\n\nSome habits of birds, such as the method of showing off to the female, of manipulating food\u2014with or without the use of the feet\u2014seem remarkably constant, but the ordinary way of living is subject to considerable variation. Darwin and Wallace have given a good deal of evidence on this head, and perhaps it will not be considered out of place if a little more be added.\n\nThe Pariah-kite of India (Milvus govinda), habitually takes cooked vegetable food in default of meat, such as boiled rice, bread, &c.\n\nThe White-breasted Kingfisher (Halcyon smyrnensis), a bird of varied general feeding-habits, as it takes both fish and land-animals such as earthworms, occasionally practises piracy; one which haunts the tank in the Museum grounds has taken to robbing the Dabchicks (Podicipes albibennis) living there of their fish; I have seen it make several attempts, one at least successfully.\n\nThe King-crow (Diorurus ater) of India, although usually preying for itself, also practises piracy at times; and though normally insectivorous, it will also attack small birds and fish.\n\nThe Indian House-crow (Corvus splendens), though usually carrying objects with its beak like Passerine birds generally, may be occasionally seen carrying something in its feet like a bird of prey. As the object is always according to my experience, valueless, a leaf, bit of dry cow-dung, or a stick, it would seem that the prudence of the crow prevents the bird from experimenting on articles of food in this way, lest they be lost.\nThis crow certainly does learn new habits; those at the Museum are afraid to fish things out of the tank, but down by the Hooghly they take objects off water readily. At the Grand Hotel in Calcutta they have learnt to catch food on the wing, owing to being fed by residents in this way.\n\nMr. A. L. Butler observed in the Andamans one individual of the Chestnut-headed Bee-eater (*Melittophagus swinhoii*) capturing small beetles while clinging to a bank, while others of the species were hawking insects on the wing in the ordinary way. (*Journ. B.N.H.S.*, Vol. XII., p. 561).\n\nI had a common domestic drake which learned to fly up and perch on a seat in company with two Muscovy ducks kept with him. His general power of flight also improved much by his association with these birds, which, as usual with the species, were much more powerful and ready with their wings than common ducks.\n\nRai R. B. Sanyal Bahadur records that some Wigeons (*Mareca penelope*) and White-eyed Pochards (*Nyroca africana*) kept in an aviary with many other birds learned in this way to fly up to the perches and sit there. (*Hand-book to the Management of Animals in Captivity in Lower Bengal*, p. 309, Calcutta, 1892).*\n\nI observed that some common Teal (*Nettium crecca*) confined in another aviary at the same garden (Calcutta) used to perch on the narrow ridges of nest-boxes. This was also in all probability an acquired habit, as this Teal seems never to perch when wild. No other non-perching ducks in the same aviary acquired the habit, not even the Garganeys (*Querquedula circia*), nor the Wigeons or White-eyed Pochards, though perching ducks were confined with them.\n\n**Conclusions.**\n\nIn most of this paper I have merely tried to record some facts which may be useful to students of variation, but with regard to the facts concerning the range of variation in domesticated birds given in Section H. (p. 164), the following conclusions seem justifiable:\n\nDomestication seems not to induce variation directly; it merely gives varietal individuals a better chance of surviving and multiplying, and of producing secondary varieties by crossing with each other or with the type. The frequent occurrence of varieties in the wild state shows that the tendency to produce them is there just as strongly.\n\nWere domestication to act in inducing variability by the change of conditions, we should expect to find our protected species varying more\n\n* The writer includes the Mandarin Duck (*A. galericulata*) as one of the species that acquired the perching habit; but this bird is naturally a percher.\nin proportion as they were more unnaturally treated. But this is not the case; the Java Sparrow and Collared Dove, bred for generations in small cages, do not vary more than wild birds; whereas the Pheasant, which lives almost a completely natural life, is more variable than these.\n\nClimate does not directly induce colour-variation. The same colours constantly recur in domestic birds in Europe and in India, without variation in intensity. But some types of colouration may be absent altogether in one or the other country. Here an indirect action of climate, weeding out colours which are correlated with an unsuitable constitution, may be reasonably suspected.\n\nFor so soon as a correlation between colour and some constitutional quality is detected, it will probably be found that selection steps in even in domesticated birds not bred for colour. Fighting cocks are very variable in colour, being judged solely by courage and prowess in the pit, and hence not selected deliberately for colour-points. Yet the quasi-natural selection to which they are exposed seems to act in suppressing some few colours; cuckoo-coloured (barred-grey) birds\u2014so common among unselected fowls\u2014were rare in English fighting game, and I have never seen a cuckoo-coloured Aseel or Indian game-cock. In this breed, which is even more courageous than the English game, and has to fight under more trying conditions, the range of colour is altogether more limited than among English birds; the hen, for instance, is never of the wild \"partridge\" colour, and very rarely shows any approach to it, though the cock usually has some likeness to the male of Gallus gallus, the Red-Jungle Cock, his ancestor.\n\nOn the other hand, the duck, domesticated in so unnatural a climate as that of India, shows much the same variations as it does in England.\n\nEvery species we have taken under our protection varies in its own way; the two tame geese, Grey and Chinese, so nearly allied that they produce a fertile hybrid, have not an identical range of variation.\n\nThe variations of domestic birds have mostly an abnormal and unnatural appearance, like casual variations among wild forms; this may in some cases be explained. For instance, most domestic species produce a white variety, and albinoes are common among wild birds; yet these are usually unfitted for the struggle for existence on account of their colour, and accordingly we find few white species. Those we do find may reasonably be supposed to have originated as albinistic sports; in the family where white species are commonest\u2014the Herons\u2014we still find yet other species which commonly produce temporary or permanent albinoes. A bird with the primary quills only white at once looks unnatural, and yet it is an extremely common variation among both tame and wild birds. Examination of the white quills, either in\npied or pure white varieties, will very commonly show them soft and abraded at the tips, a serious matter for a wild bird. Accordingly we find that white-quilled species, like white ones, are almost always large and strong, and well able to defend themselves.\n\nWhy no species is mottled or splashed or irregularly pied, as tame forms and varieties commonly are, is less easy to understand. But the fact that constitutional disturbance seems to cause a bird to become temporarily so marked, may afford a clue. Such birds may be weak in constitution, and unfitted to live in a wild state. The hens do not appear to object to them, witness the case given by Darwin of Sir R. Heron's pied Peacock, and that of the pied Black bird recorded by Mr. Bucknill in his Birds of Surrey. This latter was evidently weakly; his whiteness increased with age, and he died from natural causes.\n\nAt the same time, some species seem incapable of producing mottled or irregularly pied varieties; I have never seen such in the Turkey or Collared Dove, and the Guinea-fowl is never mottled or splashed, although its pied markings are not quite as regular as a wild bird's. The Canary, on the other hand, is particularly prone to be asymmetrical and irregular in its markings, as also is the Pigeon.\n\nThe tendency of so many domestic birds to become coarse and heavy-looking, especially marked in the Water-fowl, is probably due to the adding up of small variations in that direction; these would, especially on birds performing long and perilous migrations, be weeded out in each generation; but if allowed to breed, would, in accordance with a tendency well-known to fanciers, produce offspring coarser and heavier even than themselves, till a conspicuous difference in appearance resulted.\n\nIt is possible that the tendency to the increased production of fleshy out-growths, like the combs and wattles of poultry, is connected with this assumption of a coarse habit of body; but it must be remembered that such processes are peculiarly susceptible to external influences and constitutional changes, and, hence, if the environment is ever proved to produce an inherited effect on any bird, might be expected to show this effect early and conspicuously.\nVariations of Pintail Snipe (Gallinago stenura).\nNettium Albigulare.\n\nA.

R\u00e2y, D.Sc.\n\n[Read 3rd December 1902.]\n\nA solution of mercuric chloride with ammonia yields what is commonly known as the infusible white precipitate for which two different formul\u00e6 have been proposed from time to time, according as it is regarded as the amido-derivative of the sublimate: $\\text{NH}_2\\cdot\\text{HgCl}$ or as the mono-substitution product of sal-ammoniac: $\\text{Hg}\\cdot\\text{NH}_2\\text{Cl}$. Rammelsberg and Pesci even go a step further; they propose to double the formula of the compound and look upon it as a double salt of ammonium chloride and di-mercurammonium chloride: $\\text{NH}_4\\text{Cl} + \\text{NHg}_2\\text{Cl}$.\n\nHofmann and Marburg, who have recently repeated the experiments of Rammelsberg and Pesci, have come to the conclusion that through the researches of the last named chemists the formul\u00e6 of the mercurammonium compounds have been unnecessarily complicated, and they further maintain that the infusible white precipitate may be regarded as amido mercuric chloride, and as the salts of Millon\u2019s base contain \u201cwater of constitution,\u201d they should be looked upon as oxyidmercurammonium salts of the type $\\text{OHg}_2 = \\text{NH}_2\\text{X}$.\n\n1 Zur Kenntniss der Stickstoffquecksilber-verbindungen Annalen: Bd. 305, p. 191.\nIt is somewhat surprising that Hofmann and Marburg should have overlooked the valuable contributions of Andr\u00e9, which throw considerable light on the constitution of the compounds in question. The French chemist has carefully studied the interaction of corrosive sublimate and ammonia under varying conditions and degrees of dilution,\\(^1\\) and finds, moreover, that a solution of the sublimate and ammonium chloride when treated with potash (l.c. p. 1110) yields a compound which may be viewed as made up of equal molecules of dimercurammonium and mercuroxy ammonium chlorides: \\(NHg_2Cl + NH_2OHg_2Cl\\). It should be noted, however, that this rather complex formula admits of being simplified as \\(2NHg_2Cl + H_2O\\).\n\nJudging from analogy, I was naturally led to expect that mercuric nitrite solution with ammonia would yield a compound of the formula \\(NH_2-Hg-NO_2\\). The expectation was in a way realised, only in place of the mono-, a di-substitution product was invariably obtained, viz., \\(N.Hg.Hg.NO_2\\) or dimercurammonium nitrite with a semi-molecule of water. When this nitrite is treated with hydrochloric acid and gently warmed, it dissolves to a clear solution, evolving nitrous fumes. On evaporation a crystalline double chloride of the formula \\(2HgCl_2 + NH_4Cl\\) is obtained; hydrobromic acid also yields a compound of analogous constitution. The aqueous solutions of these double salts again, when treated with an excess of alkali, throw down precipitates of the type \\(NHg_2X\\): where \\(X\\) represents a halogen atom.\\(^2\\)\n\nThe haloids as obtained by me, however, seem to conform to the general formula \\(2NHg_2X.H_2O\\). The water is obstinately held by these salts\u2014even at 160\u00b0 C.; and hence this water may be regarded as \"water of constitution.\"\n\nIt may be urged that the hydrated compounds, in view of their high molecular weights, may all be taken to have one instead of a semi-molecule of water, and the percentages of mercury and nitrogen, &c., may still fall fairly within the range of \"errors of experiment;\" but the concurring testimonies of the analyses of the different compounds under the respective heads speak in favour of a semi-molecule.\n\nAs regards the question whether these salts should be regarded as of the type mercuroxy\u2014or mercurammonium derivatives, my answer is in favour of the latter. On treating the double salt \\(2HgBr_2.NH_4Br\\), with an alkali I have succeeded in preparing not only the hydrated bromide \\(2NHg_2Br.H_2O\\), but also a salt of the formula \\(2NHg_2Br.HgBr_2\\) which is absolutely non-hydrated. A corresponding chloride has been described by Kane, though prepared under different conditions. \\([Ann. Chem. Phys.\\)\n\n\\(^1\\) Compt. Rend. T. 108, pp. 235, 290, 1108, 1164.\n\\(^2\\) Trans. Chem. Soc. (1902), Vol. 81, p. 644.\nJOURNAL\nOF THE\nASIATIC SOCIETY OF BENGAL.\nPART II.\nTITLE PAGE AND INDEX\nFOR\n1902.\nAgain, the meruroxy-ammonium chloride, if it exists at all, when heated, decomposes into ammonia, nitrogen, water, and calomel (Kane). But both the chloride and the bromide as obtained by me decompose according to the equation: $2 \\text{NHg}_2\\text{X.H}_2\\text{O} = \\text{N}_2 + 2 \\text{HgX} + \\text{Hg}_2 + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}$\u2014a reaction which has been established quantitatively, as will be shown in a subsequent communication. Scarcely a trace of ammonia could be detected even by Nessler\u2019s reagent; I thus find myself in agreement with Weyl\u2019s observations, though his salt is non-hydrated. Andr\u00e9, as has been already noted, goes halfway between Kane and Weyl and believes in the existence of two distinct compounds: $\\text{NHg}_2\\text{Cl}$ and $\\text{OHg}_2 = \\text{NH}_2\\text{Cl}$, often formed side by side.\n\nIn the case of infusible white precipitate, as we have already seen, Kane attributes to it the formula, $\\text{NH}_2\\text{HgCl}$. Rammelsberg, on the other hand, looks upon it as a \u201cdouble salt,\u201d having the composition, $\\text{NHg}_2\\text{Cl} + \\text{NH}_4\\text{Cl}$. He is supported in his contention by the compound \u201cdissociating\u201d into $\\text{NHg}_2\\text{Cl}$ and $\\text{NH}_4\\text{Cl}$ on treatment with H.OH, or better K.OH. A study of the decomposition of the compound under the action of heat, on the other hand, corroborates the other view of its constitution. For, if Rammelsberg\u2019s formula be accepted, the decomposition might be expected on the following lines (cf. decomposition under heat of ammonio-magnesium chloride):\n\n$$\\text{NHg}_2\\text{Cl} \\rightarrow \\text{NH}_4\\text{Cl}.$$  \n\n$$\\text{NHg}_2\\text{Cl} + \\text{NH}_4\\text{Cl},$$  \n\n$$\\text{N} + \\text{Hg} + \\text{HgCl} + \\text{NH}_4\\text{Cl}.$$  \n\nBut the amount of ammonium chloride was relatively insufficient, nor was there any free mercury found. The slight amount of ammonium chloride may well be due to a secondary reaction between calomel and ammonia. Here the decomposition is found rather to agree with Kane\u2019s view of the constitution.\n\nWe thus find that both these views about the constitution of the infusible white precipitate are supported by experimental data, which can well be explained by having recourse to considerations of \u201ctautomerism.\u201d Although we know little or next to nothing about the molecular configuration of the so-called \u201cdouble salts,\u201d it would be interesting to note that such instances of \u201ctautomerism\u201d are given in inorganic chemistry. (cf. in this respect, Hantzsch, on the tautomerism of hyponitrous acid and its salts, Annalen, Bd. 292, 340).\n\nThe so-called meruroxy-ammonium chloride, $\\text{NH}_2(\\text{Hg.OHg})\\text{Cl}$,\nwhich we have regarded as $\\text{NHg}_2\\text{Cl} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}$, breaks up, according to Kane, into nitrogen, ammonia, water, mercury, and calomel. The anhydrous salt, $\\text{NHg}_2\\text{Cl}$, according to Weyl, breaks up into $\\text{HgCl} + \\text{Hg} + \\text{N}$. Our results with the hydrated variety conform to Weyl's result with the anhydrous salt. It would thus appear that there is no necessity for setting up two distinct types of compounds, viz., (1) mercuroxy-ammonium, and (2) dimercurammonium, for the salts supposed to belong to the former class do not yield any appreciable ammonia as they are stated, by Kane, to do. Therefore the salts regarded as mercuroxy-ammonium compounds may very reasonably be looked upon as (hydrated) dimercurammonium salts. [cf. Trans. Chem. Soc., Vol. 81, (1902), pp. 645-46].\n\nThis conclusion is further corroborated by the corresponding bromine compound, which behaves exactly like the chloride. But a stronger argument in favour of the non-oxylic constitution of this class of compounds seems to be based upon a study of the dimercurammonium nitrate, which I have prepared according to two distinct methods (see below).\n\n---\n\n**Dimercurammonium Nitrate.\u2014By P. C. R\u00e2y, D.Sc.**\n\n**Preliminary.**\u2014When dimercurammonium nitrite is treated with halogen acid, nitrous fumes are evolved and a clear solution is obtained, which on concentration yields the double salt, $2\\text{HgCl}_2\\cdot\\text{NH}_4\\text{Cl}$, or $2\\text{HgBr}_2\\cdot\\text{NH}_4\\text{Br}$, as the case may be. [Vide Journ. Chem. Soc., Trans., Vol. 81 (1902), p. 648]. The behaviour of nitric acid towards the nitrite, however, affords a marked contrast, giving rise to the formation of a practically insoluble compound. Here, the nitrite molecule evidently does not undergo a complete \"break-up\" and the reaction seems to consist in the replacement of the radical $\\text{NO}_2$ by $\\text{NO}_3$, just as silver nitrite under similar conditions is converted into silver nitrate.\n\nFor making a comparative study, the so-called mercuroxy-ammonium nitrate was also prepared and its properties studied.\n\n**Preparation.**\u2014To the pale yellow dimercurammonium nitrite strong nitric acid is added from a pipette, till the evolution of nitrous fumes ceases. After a time the clear supernatant acid liquid is decanted off and the substance dried over sulphuric acid till the weight is constant. The mother liquor on testing indicates the presence of traces of mercury, showing that the compound is only very slightly soluble in nitric acid.\n\n---\n\n1 The nomenclature adopted is as given in the new Edition of Watts' Dictionary of Chemistry.\nThe nitrate thus obtained is a white amorphous powder; it retains moisture, which is not driven off even when the salt is dried in the steam-oven. It approaches closely to the formula $2\\text{NHg}_2\\text{NO}_3 + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}$.\n\n**Analysis.**\u2014The analyses given below are of distinct preparations:\n\n| Table of Analyses. |\n|---------------------|\n| % Mercury | % Nitrogen | % Water |\n| 2\\text{NHg}_2\\text{NO}_3 + \\text{H}_2\\text{O} requires | ... | 82\u00b747 | 5\u00b777 | 1\u00b786 |\n| Found | ... | 83\u00b713 | 6\u00b702 |\n| | | 82\u00b771 | 5\u00b792 |\n| | | 82\u00b748 | |\n| \\text{NHg}_2\\text{NO}_3 requires | ... | 84\u00b703 | 5\u00b788 |\n\n**Behaviour.**\u2014When heated in a bulb tube the salt decomposes, without fusion, with a sudden puff, giving off nitrous fumes, mercury, and water, and leaving a reddish yellow residue, consisting mainly of mercuric oxide.\n\n**\"Mercuroxy\"-ammonium Nitrate.**\n\n**Preparation.**\u2014To a moderately strong solution of mercuric nitrate containing the minimum amount of the free acid dilute ammonia solution was added with constant shaking till there was a persistent smell of ammonia. A bulky, flocculent, very pale yellow precipitate was obtained, which was thrown on the filter-paper, washed and dried in the steam-oven. The filtrate, though smelling distinctly of ammonia, gave on testing indications of the presence of notable quantities of mercury.\n\n**Analysis.**\u2014Prep. I. In this, the preparation was washed with cold water:\u2014$\\text{Hg}=83.20\\%$.\n\nPrep. II. In this case, the preparation was washed with hot water. $\\text{Hg}=82.99\\%\\,(a), 83.03\\%\\,(b); \\text{N}=5.6\\%$.\n\nPrep. III. The dry substance was digested with nitric acid, the acid decanted off, and the substance dried once more as above. The colour was found to change from pale yellow to perfectly white. $\\text{Hg}=83.2\\%; \\text{N}=5.9\\%$.\n\nThe identity of all the above preparations, as far as analysis goes, seems to be established.\n\n**Behaviour.**\u2014All the above samples when heated in a bulb-tube decomposed with a sudden puff, giving off nitrous fumes, and yielding a mirror of mercury, the residue mostly of mercuric oxide. It was, however, distinctly noticed that moisture was on the stem of the tube.\nConclusion.\n\nThe identity of the so-called mercuroxy-ammonium nitrate with dimercurammonium nitrate is at once apparent.\\(^1\\) The formation of the \"mercuroxy\" compound in the presence of strong nitric acid would seem to favour the view already put forward, namely, that the dimercurammonium compounds are non-oxylic in constitution. Pesci found that when the preparation was washed with hot water, the anhydrous salt, \\(NHg_2NO_3\\) was obtained. This, as will be seen, is not, however, borne out by my own experiments.\n\n\\(^1\\) There is, however, this difference that when the compound is obtained by precipitation of mercuric nitrate with ammonia, the colour is faintly yellow.\n\n---\n\nThe Function of the Vasiform Orifice of the Aleurodidae.\u2014\nBy H. W. Peal, F.E.S.\n\nThe vasiform orifice of the Aleurodidae is a small oval organ always present on the posterior surface of the dorsum of both the larval and adult insects. This organ consists of three parts: The vasiform orifice, which is a more or less oval pit or depression. The operculum, which is a flat shield-like organ which covers the vasiform orifice to a greater or less extent. It is hinged on to the anterior margin of the orifice. The lingula and a narrow tube-like organ, which lies beneath, and sometimes projects beyond the operculum. The lingula is usually two jointed. It is continued within the body as a transparent tube, which expands and opens into the body cavity of the insect.\n\nSo far the exact function of the vasiform orifice has received little or no attention and the exact use to which it is put has up to the present been a matter of conjecture. While observers like Maskell have surmised that this organ is concerned in the secretion of honey dew, no one as yet has been able to definitely state that such is really the case.\n\nSome time back, while I was examining an aleurodid which in its earlier stages is remarkably flat and transparent, I was fortunate enough to observe the lingula in motion. This organ was shot out beyond the vasiform orifice with extreme rapidity, it being protruded some four or five times a second.\n\nWhen the lingula was shot out the vasiform orifice moved in unison, the upper edge being bent inwards while the whole organ moved caddad. The internal opening of the lingula lies directly in the path\nof the rudimentary circulatory system, and when the organ is in motion it throws the circulatory fluid into a pulsating motion for some distance within the body cavity. I have been unable so far to detect the actual formation of the globules of honey dew, but as soon as the lingula comes to rest after a series of protrusions a small globule may be seen just within the lower end of the lingula. This globule advances slowly, being apparently forced forward by the movement of the lingula, and after awhile reaches the tip of that organ. I have never observed these globules within the lingula of an adult insect, but once on examining an adult male of *Aleurodes simula*, I perceived a globule of honey dew emerging from the lingula.\n\nThere is no doubt that the function of the organ is the secretion of honey dew and the operculum may be regarded as a protective covering to this organ.\n\nIt would appear that but little honey dew is formed by these insects compared with the majority of the coccids, aphids, or psyllids.\n\n---\n\n*The \"Green Bug\" and other Jassids as food for Birds.*\n\nBy H. W. Peal, F.E.S.\n\nIn 1897, a very interesting paper by Mr. F. Finn, the Deputy Superintendent of the Indian Museum, appeared on this subject in *Indian Museum Notes*.\n\nMr. Finn, however, confined his attention to the \"green bug\" (*Nezara viridula*, Linn.), which periodically at the beginning of every cold weather appears in swarms in Calcutta. Fortunately this little intruder contents itself with a merely temporary visit, as during the period of its stay it is a source of no little discomfort. This, on the other hand, is the true reason why the suggestion put forward by Mr. Finn has not up to now, at any rate to my knowledge, received the notice it really deserves. The period of its stay is far too short to make its collection profitable.\n\nSome time back, while investigating the operations of the mango jassid (*Ideocerus niveosparsus*, Leitherry), it struck me that it would be an excellent addition to the \"green bug\" as a bird food. This jassid may in most years be found in swarms in mango topes in February, March, and April. It subsists by sucking out the juices from the young flower shoots of the mango. This insect is one of the most serious of our mango pests. Still later in June and July I found another jassid\nexceedingly plentiful in the various plots around Calcutta devoted to the cultivation of the Bhindi (*Hibiscus esculentus*). This insect is clothed in a uniform coat of green, is far softer than the two jassids just referred to, and would, if anything, prove an even more palatable addition to the above two species as a bird food. These three species taken together would, I am sure, make it worth one's while to take the matter up. (There are in addition several other species of jassids occurring in abundance on various plants which could also be systematically collected).\n\nIt will be seen from Mr. Finn's paper that 'ants' eggs' sell from about 1s. to 1s. 6d. per lb. retail in the English market. Presumably about 4 to 6d. would be about the correct wholesale rate it could be sold at. I have no data to hand which would give one an idea as to how much each lantern trap could be counted on to catch in a night during the season. As a matter of fact, it must be admitted that it would vary enormously with the state of the weather, the wind, and to a certain degree the type of lantern used. I have myself gathered considerably over a pound of the green fly from off an ordinary lamp in about two hours' time.\n\nA suitable lantern trap would consume about an anna's worth of oil per night and it would require to catch some two or three pounds of insects per night to make it pay.\n\nLast year the insects were plentiful from the 27th October to the 5th November. Giving an estimate of two pounds of dried insects off each lantern trap, the total catch for a hundred lamps would be nearly 2 cwt. per night or a ton for the ten days' work.\n\nAs for the mango jassid I did not know at first if it would prefer immolation in a lantern trap to the allurements of the mango shoots. I find, however, that like the rest of its family it has a strong fascination for light.\n\nOne can count on ten days or a fortnight for the \"green bug,\" a period of nearly three months for the mango jassid, and two months on the \"bhindi\" jassid. This would mean at least 150 working days for each lamp and the total catch for each lamp would be almost 3 cwt. of insects. This on 200 lamps would represent an outturn of about 30 tons. On a basis of 4d. a pound, this would mean some \u00a31,120.\n\nFor drying the insects Mr. Finn's idea of cheap coarse cloth stretched on frames is both inexpensive and efficient. The frames should be double to prevent the insects while drying being eaten up by other birds, like the crows. If, however, the work was taken up on an extensive scale, it would pay to use a dryer, such as is used for drying fruit in the United States or tea in India.\n\nI could never understand before where the insect hid itself during\nthe day. This year while searching for insects on peepul seedlings, I found this jassid packed away in large numbers under the leaves. Possibly the peepul is its food plant. Peepul seedlings spring up in enormous numbers during the rains in all sorts of likely and unlikely places. For various causes most of these seedlings die out about the beginning of the cold season, but during the time of their growth they would afford an unlimited supply of food for the bug.\n\n---\n\nNote on the occurrence of Motacilla taivana (Swinhoe) near Calcutta.\u2014\nBy Capt. H. J. Walton, I.M.S.\n\nIn the Fauna of British India, Birds, Vol. II, p. 296, under the heading of Motacilla flava, Mr. Oates remarks: \"An allied species, M. taivana, Swinhoe, from China and the Malay Peninsula, is extremely likely to be found in Burma.............A specimen of a wagtail in the Hume collection killed at Howrah, Calcutta, would appear to belong to this species, but unless supported by other specimens, it would be premature to pronounce it such.\"\n\nWith the exception of the specimen mentioned above, I can find no reference to the occurrence of M. taivana in India.\n\nOn January 7th, 1900, amongst a number of live small birds in a coop in the New Market, Calcutta, I noticed a wagtail that I was unfamiliar with. I bought the bird and skinned it. I labelled it at the time \"? M. taivana.\" For various reasons, I have only lately been able to re-examine the skin and to compare it with the wagtails in the Indian Museum. In doing this, I had the great advantage of the assistance of Mr. Frank Finn. My bird differs from all the Indian wagtails in the Museum collection, and except that it is of a slightly duller yellow on the under parts, agrees perfectly with a specimen of M. taivana, from Foochow. Mr. Finn agrees with me that my bird is undoubtedly M. taivana.\n\nThe distribution of this species, given by Mr. Bowdler Sharpe, in the Catalogue of Birds in the British Museum, Vol. X, is \"Kurile Islands, Eastern Siberia, Dauria, Amoorland, throughout China and Formosa, wintering in the Malayan Peninsula.\"\n\nThe fact of my specimen being exposed for sale in the market in the same coop as a miscellaneous lot of common small birds, \"ortolans\" in the language of the market\u2014completely negatives the idea that it may have been imported.

Read 1st April 1903.]\n\nHaving had occasion to assort the material of the natural order Scrophularine\u00e6, preserved in the Herbarium attached to the Royal Botanic Garden at Shibpur, the writer finds, as is usually the case, that there are a number of species belonging to the order which are new to India in the sense that they are not included in the account of the family published by Sir J. D. Hooker in the Flora of British India, vol. iv. (1884). In almost every case the new record is the result of the extension of the territories of the Indian Empire along its north-western and its north-eastern frontiers. Following the practice, commenced now fifteen years ago, of providing diagnoses of species thus found to be new to the Indian flora, arranged according to the method of the Flora of British India, for the benefit of members of the Society who may be botanising near the Indian frontiers, the writer now presents the necessary supplement to this particular natural family. Having regard, however, to the needs of those who may be working in the field elsewhere than on the frontiers, new localities for species already accounted for in the Flora of British India are duly noted.\n\nJ. ii. 3\n1.

This is the species with softly hirsute leaves and echinate or, as Bentham expresses it \"muricate-tubercular\" seeds, exactly like those of L. ramosissima.\n\n3. LINARIA CABULICA Bent., DC.

LINDENBERGIA MACROSACHYA Benth.\nDelete synonyms of the F. B. I.:\u2014L. siamensis Miq. in Herb. Adenosma cuspidatum Benth. in Wall. Cat. 3852.\n\nDelete the localities:\u2014Martaban, Siam, China.\nSome confusion has grown up regarding the identity and the distribution as well as the synonymy of *Lindenbergia philippinensis* and *Lindenbergia macrostachya*; this requires to be definitely settled, if for no other reason than that, as the *Flora of British India* truly says, the one may prove only a variety of the other.\n\nThe species *Lindenbergia philippinensis* was first described as such in *DC. Prodr.* x. 377 (1846), the basis of the species being *Stemodia philippinensis* Cham. & Schlecht. *Linnea* iii. 5. (1828), and the Philippines being then its only known locality. Hooker in *Flor. Brit. Ind.* iv. 261, also describes the species but gives it as occurring in Chittagong, Burma, Pegu, Tenasserim, and as extending to China and the Philippines.\n\nThe species *Lindenbergia macrostachya*, which is admitted by Bentham, as well as by Hooker, to be very nearly related to *L. philippinensis*, was first described by Bentham in *Scroph. Ind.* 22 (1835), and is again described in the *Prodromus* x. 376. It is thus, as a *Lindenbergia* at all events, older than *L. philippinensis*. But, since the basis of *L. macrostachya* is Bentham's own *Stemodia macrostachya* in *Wall. Cat.* 3925 (1829), the epithet *philippinensis* has priority over the epithet *macrostachya*. Bentham gives the distribution of *L. macrostachya* as from the N.-W. Himalaya as far as to Martaban and Moulmein. This, however, he only manages to do by including in the species his own *Adenosma cuspidatum* in *Wall. Cat.* 3852 (1829) which is a Burmese plant. Hooker does not put the distribution in this way. He says that *L. macrostachya* occurs in the N.-W. Himalaya and in Martaban; a somewhat different statement from Bentham's. But it seems clear, from the way in which the citations are made, that the species is considered Burmese solely on the strength of *Wall. Cat.* 3852. The further distribution Siam is clearly on the strength of *Lindenbergia siamensis* Miq. in Herb.; that of China is probably on the strength of specimens from China named *Lindenbergia macrostachya* by Hance and by Maximowicz.\n\nThe only tangible character in the various diagnoses of these two species is that the style in *Lindenbergia macrostachya* is glabrous, whereas in *L. philippinensis* it is hirsute at the base. The character of glabrous and pubescent leaves is unreliable; Hance's \"*L. macrostachya,*\" for example, is undoubtedly *L. philippinensis* with nearly glabrous leaves; on the other hand Griffith and King have both collected in North-West India examples of undoubted *L. macrostachya* with leaves as pubescent as those of *L. philippinensis*.\n\nAs a rule the calyx is distinctive but even at best the difference does not amount to much and there are some Burmese examples of *L. philippinensis*, i.e., of the plant with a very hairy base to the style, that have calyx-teeth quite like those of *L. macrostachya* which always has a glabrous style. The corolla of *L. macrostachya* is smaller than that of *L. philippinensis*, but the character, being a relative one, is hardly sufficient for absolute diagnosis, and the corolla of *L. philippinensis* itself varies too much in size to make the character of more than subsidiary value.\n\nBy the only crucial character, \"style hairy at the base,\" *Adenosma cuspidatum* Benth. is certainly *Lindenbergia philippinensis*! So also is \"*L. siamensis* Miq.\" which is only *L. siamensis* Teijsm. & Binn., of which I have seen an authentic example and of which there is a drawing made from the living plant in the Calcutta Herbarium. By this test too the *Lindenbergia macrostachya*, from China, of Hance and Maximowicz, is *L. philippinensis*.\n\nIn short *Lindenbergia macrostachya* is a species strictly confined to Northern India; *L. philippinensis* is a species that extends from Central China, throughout the whole of Indo-China from the Brahmaputra river eastward to Upper Tenasserim.\nand to the Philippines. It has not, however, as stated in the Index Kewensis, been yet collected in any part of Malaya.\n\nWhether the two plants deserve to be considered specifically distinct is rather an open question. They are easily distinguished in most cases and in any case are certainly very distinct varieties.\n\n15. ADENOSMA R. Br.\n\n1.* ADENOSMA INOPINATUM Prain; hirsute, leaves ovate-acute, serrate; flowers axillary sessile, 3 outer sepals in fruit very large, rounded at base, about twice as long as broad, 2 inner very small lanceolate. A. ovatum Flor. Brit. Ind. iv. 263 as to the Malay Peninsula locality, not of Benth.\n\nMALAY PENINSULA; Malacca, Griffith! Singapore, Anderson! Kunstler!\n\nBranching from the base, black when dry; branches 2-3 ft long, often rooting below, prostrate or ascending. Leaves 1\u00b75-1\u00b775 in., base cuneate, tapering to a very short petiole. Fruiting sepals nearly \u00b75 in. long, membranous reticulate pubescent outer twice as long as broad. Flowers blue.\n\nThis is very near A. ovatum from which it differs by its narrower fruiting sepals and still nearer A. subrepens from which it differs by its rather larger, serrate not crenate and acute not obtuse leaves.\n\n9.

Suppl. 562 (1860) not of Benth.; stout, erect, densely tawny-tomentose, leaves very short-petioled, ovate ovate-lanceolate or lanceolate, acute or subobtuse, crenate-serrate, flowers in dense cylindric villous bracteate spikes, corolla blue; capsule ovate abruptly beaked.\n\nNICOBARS: Kamorta, Kurz! MALAY PENINSULA, Prov. Wellesley, at Kuleang Ulu, Curtis 2238! DISTRIBUT. Sumatra, at Rau (Teijsmann 1157)! Bangka, near Djebus (Teijsmann 3429)!\n\nStems 2-4 ft., and leaves on both sides densely villous with tawny hairs, as are the leafy bracts \u00b775 in. long at base of spikes, but gradually decreasing upwards. Spikes 2-3\u00b75 in. long, very dense. Calyx-teeth lanceolate, the uppermost largest. Capsule straw-coloured.\n\nThe bracts of the Nicobar specimens are rather larger than these of the original Sumatra plant but the leaves are identical. The leaves of the Malayan Peninsula plant are rather narrower, but the bracts are exactly as in the Sumatra plant. The Bangka plant is rather more slender, but has the same compact heads with leafy bracts and tawny pubescence, and is very different from Pterostigma villosum Benth. (Adenosma caeruleum) to which Miquel has referred it. The nearest ally of the species is Adenosma capitatum from which, however, it is very distinct.\n\n8. ADENOSMA MACROPHYLLUM Benth.\n\nThis plant, founded on Wall. Cat. 3853, as represented in Herb. Calcutta, is only Lindenbergia philippinensis.\n17. **LIMNOPHILA** R.

Andamans; Port Blair, King's Collector!\n\nThe Burmese localities are very far north; the species may however occur elsewhere but have been overlooked. At Port Blair it is to be suspected that the species has been accidentally introduced with seed of rice from India.\n\n21. **Limnophila gratioloides** R. Br.\nAdd to localities of *F. B. I.*:\u2014Chittagong; Puttea, Clarke! Burma; Rangoon, Kurz! Tenasserim, Helfer!\n\nThe great rarity of this species to the east of India Proper leads to the suspicion of introduction.\n\n22. **Limnophila griffithii** Hook. f.\nThis interesting little species has also been collected in Perak by Kunstler, who reports the flowers as pure white, so that the plant from Nigeria referred to by Hooker may be actually the same.\n\n18. **Herpestis** G\u00e6rtn.\n\n4. **Herpestis cham\u00e6dryoides** H. B. & K., *Nov. Gen. & Sp.* ii. 369; Benth., *DC.

Leaves 5\u00b775 in. long, narrowed to the distinct petiole. Pedicels as long as or longer than the leaves. Fruiting calyx 3 in. long. Corolla yellow, rather longer than calyx.\nThis small American weed has, of late years, become quite naturalized on paths and in waste corners in the neighbourhood of Calcutta.\n\n22.

I., and may, as Hooker suggests, be but a form of that species. The two are, however, very easily distinguished in the Herbarium by the smaller, often minute, teeth on the longer filaments of T. rubens. They are still more easily distinguished in the field by the colour of the flowers: T. vagans has a fairly uniform blueish-purple or dull-violet corolla; T. rubens has a corolla with a pale lilac or nearly white tube with three bright violet-purple spots.\n\n10. TORENIA FLAVA Ham.\nAdd to localities of F. B. I.:\u2014Malay Peninsula: Perak, Kunstler!\nKunstler describes the corolla of this as bright yellow.\n\n11. TORENIA CILIATA Sm.\nAdd to synonyms of F.

Sumatra (Teijsmann 1182)!\n\nTeijsmann\u2019s original specimens of \u201cT. flava Miq. non Ham.\u201d are marked corolla caerulea. Two species of Torenia collected by Teijsmann and described by Miquel I have not seen. One of these is T. lamponga which from Miquel\u2019s description ought certainly to be T. peduncularis; the other is T. caerulea and it ought equally certainly to be T. ciliata.\n\n12. TORENIA BENTHAMIANA Hance, Ann. Sc. Nat. Ser. 4. xviii. 226 (1862); decumbent diffuse rooting at the nodes, finely tawny-tomentose; leaves petioled deltoid-ovate acute, serrate; pedicels axillary larger than the calyx or the leaves; fruiting calyx oblong, subclavate, 5-angled, keeled and chanelled, not winged; lower filaments with a very long slender tooth.\nMalay Peninsula: Johore, Ridley 4160! Distrib. China (Hance 5901)! Cochin-China.\n\nStems slender, up to a foot long; leaves '75-1 in. long including the petiole '2-'25 in. long, base rounded truncate. Calyx in fruit '5 in. long, peduncle '75-'5 in. long. Corolla '6 in. long, yellow with purple eye.\n\nThis seems to be the T. flava Bot. Mag. t. 6,700 not of Ham.\n\n24. Vandellia Linn.\n\n3.

Add to Distrib.:\u2014Sumatra, (Forbes 1981)! Java, (Kurz 555)!\n\n8*. Vandellia punctata Prain; procumbent, quite glabrous; leaves shortly petioled orbicular-ovate, succulent, crenate-serrate, distinctly punctate; pedicels in axillary and terminal racemes much longer than the calyx; sepals lanceolate glabrous not quite so long as the ovate capsule.\n\nShan Hills: Fort Stedman and Taungyi, King's Collectors!\n\nStem creeping below 12-18 in. long, somewhat succulent. Leaves '5-'75 in. long, quite glabrous. Racemes up to 2'5 in. long, distantly 10-12-flowered; pedicels very slender '4 in. long. Sepals '15 in. long, lanceolate glabrous except for the finely ciliate-serrate margins. Corolla '3 in. long, pale purple. Filaments glabrous. Capsule '2 in. long.\n\nThis species is most nearly related to V. scabra and V. mollis, the flowers and capsules much resembling those of the former, the influence being exactly that of the latter. From both it differs in its quite glabrous leaves which are thicker than in either and are very distinctly punctuate.\n\n12. Vandellia pedunculata Benth.\n\nAdd to synonyms of F. B.

Singapore, Hullett! Ridley! Pahang, Ridley!\n\nThis species appears to be common in the Eastern Peninsula, B. brachiata, on the other hand, being rare. The latter was collected at Singapore by Wallich in 1822, but had been recorded by no one else till recently when it was collected by Ridley in Pahang. The two are very similar and perhaps B. brachiata may have been overlooked.\n\n4. Bonnaya peduncularis Benth.\nThis species is based on Wall.

Little.\n\n[Received 18th March 1903. Read 1st April 1903.]\n\nPART I.\n\nThe south-west monsoon is a subject of enduring interest to many, not only to those who are continuous residents in the plains of India, or to those who are interested in raw products, but to all professional meteorologists, and to many other scientific men, whose work dovetails in with meteorological investigations. I make no claim to belong to any of these classes except the first, but my official duty as storm-warning officer for ports in the Bay of Bengal, has made it necessary for me to try and follow others in their advances in the direction of explaining complicated atmospheric changes. Any attempt by me to go beyond the r\u00f4le of follower has been either with the purpose of educating myself or merely as a pastime, and in either case it is not likely that it will be much, or any advantage to others to know what I have been studying, or what conclusions I have come to.\n\nIn my position of follower I have one strong belief which is, of course, a not uncommon belief, and it is that much of the weather in Northern India during the monsoon season depends on storms, which develop in the Bay of Bengal, or to be on the safe side, which enter India from the Bay. I have another belief which may not be so common, viz., that, in one important respect intimately connected with the character of the monsoon, the behaviour of these storms is as yet a mystery. My main object in offering this brief paper for publication is that, by showing my ignorance others may be induced to supply the necessary information, or that if that information is not available, the collection of meteorological statistics may be more specially directed so as to meet a most important demand.\n\nThe difficulty I have felt is, how to account for the line of advance of storms (the word here meaning any cyclonic disturbance, slight or severe), while moving over the Bay, or the part of the country, which they may devastate or enrich. The past few years appear to me to have cast into strong relief the importance of having this matter placed, if possible, beyond question, so that the direction of advance may not only be accountable for after the event, but may be capable of exact forecast several days before. The importance of what is called the recurving of cyclonic storms was shown in 1899, when not a single depression entered India from the Bay but recurved over Central India, and as\nevery one will remember the general distribution of rainfall in that year was great scarcity in the west and abundance in the east. The past monsoon season has been even more rich in evidence, in favour of the enquiry, which I here suggest, being one of first class importance.\n\nThe recurving of cyclonic disturbances, is not the only important matter of enquiry which a discussion of the past monsoon season brings to the surface. The disturbed weather which extended along the Himalayas on two occasions appears to me to indicate the direction in which the enquiry as to recurving should be made. These disturbances were the immediate cause of the two rain-bursts in Bengal, and I have on that account used them as a title for this paper. In what follows I have given small tables containing the more important meteorological statistics collected at the time of their occurrence and I have endeavoured to show how they serve to divide the monsoon season into periods which have important characteristics as regards the recurving of storms from the Bay and of the rainfall distribution in Northern India. No one who gives any consideration to such matters can have forgotten the famine cloud that was hanging over North-Western and Central India, in the early part of August, and the rapidity with which that foreboding vanished, when the storms from the Bay moved towards the area of drought.\n\nSome Calcutta people may remember the change that occurred in the weather here on the 30th June. On that date a very trying period of hot muggy weather came to an end, and there began, at last, what had all the appearance of the south-west monsoon.\n\nIf there should be any doubt in the minds of my Calcutta friends as to what happened here on that date, I am sure residents of Benares will remember the relief they must have experienced, not on the 30th June, but on the 2nd July, that is, two days later, when their excessive temperature gave place to the comparative coolness of the south-west monsoon. The interval of two days between these occurrences shows one of the points which I wish to make out, viz., that the change progressed from east to west. No one, I think will be likely to challenge that statement because it is accepted by everyone that south-west monsoon conditions gradually extend from the head of the Bay north-westward into Northern India. The other point which I wish to make, and which may not be readily accepted, is that the disturbance to which that change of weather was due, began in the north-east of India, and while progressing westward also extended southward over Bengal Proper in the first instance, then over Orissa and on to the Circars. It was even felt in Arakan and Madras though not very noticeably.\n\nOf the occurrences accompanying this wave of change, which\npassed over Bengal, one of the most noticeable on the meteorological record of the time is the heavy rainfall in Bengal Proper, between 8 A.M. on the 29th, and 8 A.M. on the 30th June. It appears in the record as rainfall of the 30th June.\n\nI may, perhaps, be allowed to digress here for a moment to point out the difficulty, which I shall refer to later on, in establishing the sequence of events in atmospheric matters. The only record of such events is what the observers note at certain fixed hours\u2014mostly 8 A.M., supplemented at a few places by observations at 4 P.M. If any change passes so rapidly over the land that it is completed within the 24 hours, between 8 A.M. of one day, and 8 A.M. of the next, it appears, as a simultaneous change and at times, an important part of the change is lost altogether. For instance, when a cyclone of small extent passes over an observatory the rapid fall of pressure during the approach of the central area and the rapid rise, after its passage, may occur in a few hours, and neither will be shown by the 8 A.M. record of that station, unless the passage occurs about that hour. For that reason, the pressure record of a disturbance, with a high rate of progress, is of less value in a historical survey than are those for temperature and rainfall. It would be a very awkward circumstance if the rain which falls, say in the afternoon, were to evaporate before it could be measured next morning. But the rainfall remains and though some rise of temperature occurs after the passage of a disturbance the recovery is slower than that of pressure, more especially if there should be a good deal of cloud at the time. Because of this difficulty as regards the record of pressure changes I rely more on the rainfall and temperature changes to prove the progressive motion from north to south for the disturbance which accompanied and no doubt caused the rainfall of the 30th June.\n\nThe second disturbance with which the rain-burst of the 11th August was associated was no less remarkable than the first, but it was less striking to the ordinary observer because there was not the same reversal of temperature. In one respect it was even more noticeable and that was as regards the pressure changes which in this case, strongly support the view that the disturbance entered India from Thibet. A reference to the Indian Daily Weather Report, will show that the fall of pressure preceding the June rainfall, occurred almost simultaneously over the whole of India so that pressure changes alone would not be sufficient to prove that the disturbance did not come from some other direction, from the Bay of Bengal for example, but the pressure changes preceding the August rainfall leave no room for doubt that that disturbance did not originate over the Bay. The fall of pressure began in the north-eastern Himalayas and from there, extended\nwestward and southward. The southerly element in this progressive movement was less marked in the second than in the first disturbance, as shown by both pressure and temperature changes.\n\nThe explanation of the weather changes for the periods represented for the purpose of this paper by the 30th June and the 11th August appears to be that just previous to these dates, depressions were crossing Thibet towards the Himalayan range, the first moving in a south-westerly, and the second in an almost due westerly direction. These depressions on reaching the Himalayas became to a certain extent broken up, more especially the former whose direction of motion had been almost perpendicular to the range of high hills. Owing to the comparatively small height of the hills to the north of Assam, a disturbance of some intensity entered that province and moving south-westward caused the rainfall in Assam and Bengal. The higher hills in Nepal, formed a more serious obstacle to the progress of the general disturbance, and that may be the reason why on both occasions the changes appear to have been delayed in Bihar and the United Provinces. The fact that the depressions had to pass over a range of hills extending in places to between twenty and thirty thousand feet, adds greatly to the difficulty of establishing continuity in the changes that occurred. What adds still further to the difficulty is that when a cyclonic storm encounters a range of hills of height sufficient to cause disintegration of the cyclonic system of air motion, local storms with large irregular changes of pressure and temperature and with irregular rainfall generally occur. In almost every case where a cyclonic storm moves northwards from the Bay of Bengal towards the Himalayas the storm breaks up very suddenly on reaching the hills, and instead of a well defined depression with cyclonic winds we find in a few hours a uniform distribution of pressure with numerous thunderstorms, it may be along the whole line of the Himalayas. Judging by what one observes of these storms, from the southern side of the range of hills it is very improbable that weather becomes disturbed in Thibet after a storm from the Bay of Bengal disappears amongst the hills. But that is not a sufficient reason for arguing that a cyclonic storm may not cross the Himalayas from Thibet into India. In the first place the Thibetan storm is at a high altitude, because of the Central Asian plateau, and a second reason is that the obstacle which the hills present, to the progress of a storm, from the Thibetan side is not nearly so serious as to storms from the south. There would be more or less isolated peaks to pass, instead of the solid wall, formed by the lower ranges up to 10,000 feet, surmounted by the peaks.\n\nAmong the general conclusions given in the Monthly Weather\nReview for June, 1902, issued by the Meteorological Reporter to the Government of India, and Director-General of Indian Observatories, and suggested by the discussion of the atmospheric conditions in June in Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and the adjoining seas, the following occur:\n\n(1) \"That conditions in India may be sometimes largely conditioned by actions taking place in the Central Asian areas, and that occasionally these actions extend over the greater part of Europe and Asia.\"\n\n(3) \"That these actions are largely modified by the barrier of the Himalayas and seem to spread more readily southwards through the gaps in the range.\"\n\nThese conclusions may I think be interpreted, as giving general support to my assumption that it is possible for a storm to cross the Himalayas into India from Thibet; but as regards my statement, that the depression moved towards India from a north-easterly direction, the Monthly Weather Review takes up an entirely different position. Discussing the changes of the 28th June it is there stated that \"Large and important changes occurred on this day\" and subsequently \"It hence seems probable that the main centre of the action was near Gilgit, and that it extended almost up to Lake Balkash on the north, to Chitral on the west (where pressure was steady) and on the south over the greater part of India. It is impossible to further define the scope of the action for no data are available for the regions to the east of Gilgit. The fact, however, that the fall in Upper Assam was only moderate seems to indicate that the action did not extend far eastwards into Thibet.\"\n\nWhat the comparatively small readings on that date in Assam appear to me to indicate is, that the wave of change had passed rapidly over Thibet, that the 8 A.M. pressure readings on the 28th in the north-east included some part of the recovery which had, by that time, commenced in the east; and that it had not reached the neighbourhood of Gilgit, etc. The great rapidity with which that change of pressure occurred is shown by the almost uniform fall over India, as given by the pressure readings at 8 A.M. of the 28th. The main result is that the pressure changes on that occasion give little or no indication of the direction of advance of the disturbance and that if there were no confirmatory evidence in favour of a westerly movement from other sources reliance would have to be placed on temperature and rainfall only. But the storm of the 11th August and adjoining days shows beyond all question, that that depression moved from east to west, and as in all other respects there was a striking resemblance between the two storms\nit appears to me to be an established fact that the depression accompanying the rainfall of the 11th June passed over Thibet in a westerly or south-westerly direction, and that at 8 A.M. on the morning of the 28th, the region of Gilgit was near the front of the advancing wave.\n\nBefore commenting separately on the information regarding these storms preserved in the meteorological records, I will again point out that from whatever direction the storms entered Northern India, it was not from the Bay of Bengal. For several days before and after the two dates, mentioned above, weather was unusually quiet over the Bay, and in one respect was in striking contrast to what is usual in disturbed weather. At Diamond Island the most exposed of the observatories on the sea coast easterly winds of greater or less strength are an invariable accompaniment of disturbance. During the two periods of disturbance the direction was westerly day after day, which would indicate that weather was more probably disturbed over the south of Burma, than over the Bay, that is, if there were any disturbance in that region. The unusually low wind velocity at Diamond Island is sufficient in itself to prove that there was disturbance, neither over the Bay nor in Burma, until some days after the events under discussion.\n\n**Part II.**\n\nThe following tables give in the form which appears to me most convenient for purposes of comparison, the data for the storms in succession. When weather is unsettled changes at different observatories are often very irregular more especially when local storms are frequent as appears to have been the case on both of these occasions. I have therefore given the average change for divisions containing four to six observatories or even more. The number of stations for each province or division is given in the rainfall tables.\n\n*Storm of June 30th.*\n\nThe following tables I (a) and II (a) give the pressure changes from June 27th to July 5th, and the variation from the normal in Assam, Bengal Proper, and on the northern coasts of the Bay, arranged with the view of showing the southerly movement of the disturbance. As I have already stated the pressure change is practically useless for this purpose in the case of the June storm because it extended over India with great rapidity. The fall on the 28th was general and it continued in the north on the 29th. The recovery began on the 30th and extended from Assam and Bengal Proper to Orissa on the 1st July, practically the only evidence of south-westerly movement, afforded by the table. Table II (a) shows that pressure was relatively high on the 27th June, and that\nthere was continued excess, over the area represented, throughout the period except in Bengal Proper and Assam on the 29th June, and the Burma coast on the 2nd July. If the smallest excess or largest defect be selected for these divisions it will be found in the column of the 29th for Assam and Bengal Proper, of the 30th for Orissa, and of later dates for the Circars, Akyab, and Diamond Island. The relatively small excess on the 5th in the Circars and at Diamond Island is due to a cyclonic storm which began in the south of the Bay about that time.\n\n**Table I (a).**\n\n_Giving the pressure change daily from June 27th to July 5th, arranged to show the southward movement of the disturbance._\n\n|                | June 27 | June 28 | June 29 | June 30 | July 1 | July 2 | July 3 | July 4 | July 5 |\n|----------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Assam          | -0.012\" | -0.080\" | -0.026\" | +0.041\" | +0.006\" | -0.013\" | +0.038\" | +0.053\" | +0.024\" |\n| North Bengal   | -0.009\" | -0.073\" | -0.083\" | +0.096\" | -0.006\" | -0.009\" | +0.027\" | +0.040\" | +0.029\" |\n| East Bengal    | +0.003\" | -0.075\" | -0.032\" | +0.060\" | -0.025\" | -0.021\" | +0.005\" | +0.087\" | +0.018\" |\n| South-West Bengal | +0.002\" | -0.081\" | -0.042\" | +0.037\" | +0.027\" | -0.024\" | +0.012\" | +0.075\" | +0.004\" |\n| Orissa         | +0.014\" | -0.045\" | -0.032\" | -0.006\" | +0.027\" | -0.028\" | +0.005\" | +0.032\" | +0.028\" |\n| Circars        | +0.031\" | -0.028\" | -0.008\" | +0.002\" | -0.019\" | +0.002\" | -0.024\" | +0.003\" | -0.004\" |\n| Akyab          | -0.001\" | -0.043\" | 0.000\"  | +0.005\" | -0.023\" | -0.012\" | +0.017\" | +0.073\" | -0.019\" |\n| Diamond Island | +0.038\" | -0.025\" | -0.012\" | -0.015\" | +0.011\" | -0.044\" | +0.024\" | +0.008\" | +0.004\" |\n\n**Table II (a).**\n\n_Giving the pressure variation from the normal from June 27th to July 5th, arranged to show the southward movement of the disturbance._\n\n|                | June 27 | June 28 | June 29 | June 30 | July 1 | July 2 | July 3 | July 4 | July 5 |\n|----------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Assam          | +1.11\"  | +0.34\"  | -0.002\" | +0.045\" | +0.047\" | +0.029\" | +0.055\" | +1.12\"  | +1.39\"  |\n| N.

To assist the eye I have had the larger changes and the larger variations printed in bolder type. It will be readily seen that the rapid fall of temperature began in Assam and North Bengal on the 29th June, in East Bengal on the 30th, in South-West Bengal and Orissa on July 1st, and in the Circars on the 2nd. There is here clear evidence that a wave of falling temperature proceeded from North-East India in a southerly direction beginning about the 29th June, and reaching the more southern districts three days later. Akyab and Diamond Island felt the change later and not to the same extent, as might be expected from there being a westerly element in the movement indicated by subsequent tables.\n\nFrom Table IV (a) it will be seen that mean defect in Assam was 5\u00b0\u00b77 on June 30th, about 5\u00b0 over the whole of Bengal Proper on July 1st, 4\u00b0\u00b73 in Orissa on the 2nd, 3\u00b0\u00b71 in the Circars on the 3rd, and 4\u00b0 6 at Akyab on the 4th, while at Diamond Island there was a moderate to large excess throughout the period.\n\nIt is impossible to say whether the fall of 1\u00b0\u00b75 at Diamond Island on the 5th is connected with the wave of falling temperature so clearly indicated as proceeding from the north-east or with the cyclonic disturbance which began over the south of the Bay about that date.\n### Table III (a).\n\nGiving the temperature change daily from June 27th to July 5th, arranged to show the southward movement of the disturbance.\n\n|                | June 27 | June 28 | June 29 | June 30 | July 1 | July 2 | July 3 | July 4 | July 5 |\n|----------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Assam          | +2\u00b74\u00b0   | -0\u00b72\u00b0   | -2\u00b77\u00b0   | -3\u00b72\u00b0   | +3\u00b73\u00b0  | +1\u00b73\u00b0  | +0\u00b78\u00b0  | +0\u00b75\u00b0  | -1\u00b76\u00b0  |\n| North Bengal   | +2\u00b75    | -1\u00b72    | -1\u00b78    | -2\u00b73    | -1\u00b76   | +4\u00b74   | -0\u00b72   | -1\u00b75   | +1\u00b78   |\n| East Bengal    | +0\u00b72    | +1\u00b70    | -0\u00b77    | -4\u00b72    | -2\u00b72   | +4\u00b71   | +0\u00b73   | -1\u00b76   | +0\u00b78   |\n| South-West Bengal | -1\u00b71  | +1\u00b75    | +0\u00b76    | -1\u00b73    | -7\u00b73   | +3\u00b76   | +1\u00b78   | -2\u00b70   | -2\u00b76   |\n| Orissa         | +2\u00b72    | -0\u00b77    | +0\u00b79    | +0\u00b73    | -5\u00b76   | -3\u00b75   | +6\u00b76   | +0\u00b76   | -3\u00b76   |\n| Circars        | -0\u00b75    | -3\u00b72    | +1\u00b72    | -1\u00b70    | +1\u00b70   | -4\u00b74   | -0\u00b74   | +4\u00b71   | +0\u00b71   |\n| Akyab          | -0\u00b78    | +1\u00b70    | -0\u00b72    | -2\u00b73    | 0\u00b70    | +0\u00b78   | -2\u00b73   | -2\u00b73   | +3\u00b78   |\n| Diamond Island | +1\u00b78    | +0\u00b75    | +0\u00b75    | +0\u00b72    | +0\u00b75   | 0\u00b70    | -0\u00b71   | +0\u00b77   | -1\u00b75   |\n\n### Table IV (a).\n\nGiving the temperature variation from the normal from June 27th to July 5th, arranged to show the southward movement of the disturbance.\n\n|                | June 27 | June 28 | June 29 | June 30 | July 1 | July 2 | July 3 | July 4 | July 5 |\n|----------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Assam          | +0\u00b78\u00b0   | +0\u00b73\u00b0   | -2\u00b70\u00b0   | -5\u00b77\u00b0   | -2\u00b79\u00b0  | -0\u00b75\u00b0  | +0\u00b77\u00b0  | +0\u00b74\u00b0  | -0\u00b79\u00b0  |\n| North Bengal   | +2\u00b72    | +1\u00b72    | -0\u00b78    | -3\u00b71    | -5\u00b75   | -0\u00b77   | -1\u00b73   | -2\u00b77   | -0\u00b74   |\n| East Bengal    | +1\u00b72    | +2\u00b72    | +1\u00b75    | -2\u00b77    | -5\u00b70   | -0\u00b79   | -0\u00b75   | -2\u00b71   | -1\u00b72   |\n| South-West Bengal | +2\u00b72  | +3\u00b78    | +4\u00b75    | +3\u00b73    | -4\u00b70   | -0\u00b72   | +1\u00b77   | -0\u00b72   | -2\u00b77   |\n| Orissa         | +4\u00b73    | +3\u00b73    | +4\u00b77    | +5\u00b71    | -0\u00b74   | -4\u00b73   | +2\u00b76   | +2\u00b77   | -1\u00b73   |\n| Circars        | +3\u00b78    | +0\u00b76    | +1\u00b77    | +0\u00b76    | +1\u00b76   | -2\u00b78   | -3\u00b71   | +1\u00b72   | +1\u00b75   |\n| Akyab          | +0\u00b78    | +1\u00b79    | +1\u00b76    | -0\u00b78    | -0\u00b78   | 0\u00b70    | -2\u00b73   | -4\u00b76   | -0\u00b78   |\n| Diamond Island | +1\u00b76    | +2\u00b71    | +2\u00b76    | +2\u00b79    | +3\u00b74   | +3\u00b72   | +4\u00b70   | +2\u00b75   |\n\nTables V (a) to VIII (a) are arranged to show the westerly movement of the disturbance and give the pressure and temperature changes and variations for Northern India from Assam on the east to the Punjab and Kashmir on the west.\nTable V (a) shows that the fall of pressure was general over Northern India on the 28th and on the 29th, and that the changes on those days give no indication of progressive movement; but on the 30th the recovery is shown as almost complete in Assam and North Bengal; partly complete in Bihar, beginning in the United Provinces and not yet begun in the Punjab.

Leh which is the highest of all the hill stations given in the Indian Daily Weather Report was the only station on the 4th and 5th July, for which pressure was not in moderate to large excess.\n\nThe westward progress of the temperature change is clearly shown by tables VII (a) and VIII (a). The rapid fall of temperature, which began on June 29th in Assam is most marked in North Bengal on the 30th, in Bihar on July 1st, in the United Provinces on the 2nd and 3rd, in the Punjab on the 2nd to 4th, and in Kashmir on the 5th.\n\n**Table VII (a).**\n\nGiving the temperature change daily from June 27th to July 5th, arranged to show the westward movement of the disturbance.\n\n|                | June 27 | June 28 | June 29 | June 30 | July 1 | July 2 | July 3 | July 4 | July 5 |\n|----------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Assam          | +2\u00b74\u00b0   | -0\u00b72\u00b0   | -2\u00b77\u00b0   | -3\u00b72\u00b0   | +3\u00b73\u00b0  | +1\u00b73\u00b0  | +0\u00b78\u00b0  | +0\u00b75\u00b0  | -1\u00b76\u00b0  |\n| North Bengal   | +2\u00b75    | -1\u00b72    | -1\u00b78    | -2\u00b73    | -1\u00b76   | +4\u00b74   | -0\u00b72   | -1\u00b75   | +1\u00b78   |\n| Bihar          | -0\u00b76    | +0\u00b76    | -0\u00b73    | -0\u00b75    | -5\u00b72   | -1\u00b73   | -2\u00b76   | +1\u00b77   | -0\u00b73   |\n| United Provinces| +1\u00b72    | +1\u00b79    | +0\u00b76    | +2\u00b74    | -1\u00b77   | -4\u00b70   | -5\u00b73   | +0\u00b76   | -0\u00b78   |\n| Punjab         | +2\u00b75    | +3\u00b73    | +2\u00b72    | +3\u00b72    | +1\u00b70   | -6\u00b74   | -3\u00b71   | -4\u00b79   | +2\u00b79   |\n| Srinagar, etc. | +0\u00b75    | +4\u00b75    | +3\u00b70    | +0\u00b77    | +0\u00b74   | 0\u00b70    | -1\u00b76   | -1\u00b75   | -4\u00b77   |\n\n**Table VIII (a).**\n\nGiving the temperature variation from the normal from June 27th to July 5th, arranged to show the westward movement of the disturbance.\n\n|                | June 27 | June 28 | June 29 | June 30 | July 1 | July 2 | July 3 | July 4 | July 5 |\n|----------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Assam          | +0\u00b78\u00b0   | +0\u00b73\u00b0   | -2\u00b70\u00b0   | -5\u00b77\u00b0   | -2\u00b79\u00b0  | -0\u00b75\u00b0  | +0\u00b77\u00b0  | +0\u00b74\u00b0  | -0\u00b79\u00b0  |\n| North Bengal   | +2\u00b72    | +1\u00b72    | -0\u00b78    | -3\u00b71    | -5\u00b75   | -0\u00b77   | -1\u00b73   | -2\u00b77   | -0\u00b74   |\n| Bihar          | +6\u00b79    | +7\u00b78    | +7\u00b78    | +7\u00b73    | +2\u00b76   | +1\u00b74   | -1\u00b72   | +0\u00b75   | +0\u00b74   |\n| United Provinces| +4\u00b76    | +6\u00b79    | +7\u00b78    | +10\u00b74   | +8\u00b78   | +4\u00b79   | -0\u00b72   | +0\u00b75   | -0\u00b73   |\n| Punjab         | -2\u00b79    | +0\u00b77    | +3\u00b72    | +6\u00b77    | +8\u00b70   | +1\u00b78   | -1\u00b72   | -5\u00b79   | -3\u00b71   |\n| Srinagar       | -6\u00b75    | -1\u00b79    | +2\u00b71    | +1\u00b72    | +1\u00b79   | -1\u00b73   | -4\u00b74   | -2\u00b70   | -5\u00b71   |\n| Leh            | -11\u00b70   | -3\u00b76    | -0\u00b76    | -0\u00b70    | -1\u00b70   | -1\u00b74   | +1\u00b71   | -2\u00b71   | -5\u00b77   |\nFrom Table VIII (a) it can be seen that the lowest temperature in Assam was on June 30th, in North Bengal on July 1st, in Bihar and the United Provinces on the 3rd, in the Punjab on the 4th, and in Kashmir on the 5th. The very low temperatures which are shown at Srinagar and Leh on the 27th were connected with conditions, then prevailing in Western India, and have no connection with the disturbance or series of disturbances which I have been discussing.\n\nA very striking feature of Table VIII (a) is the large fall of temperature in Northern India between June 30th and July 4th. In the United Provinces the change was from an excess of $10^\\circ$ on the 30th to a small defect on the 3rd, and in the Punjab from excess of $8^\\circ$ on July 1st to defect of $5^\\circ$ on the 4th.\n\n**Table IX (a).**\n\n**Rainfall.

They are similar, to those which precede as to divisions of the country. The figures I have obtained by merely adding up the rainfall recorded at the various stations in each division and the stations which I have taken, are those given in the *Indian Daily Weather Report*. In the first column of each of these Tables the number of stations is given so that the average rainfall for each day or for a group of days so far as it depends on the records of the stations selected can be obtained by dividing by that number. The heavy rainfall in East Bengal on the 27th June, has no connection, so far as I can see with the general disturbance which culminated in the down-pour in East and North Bengal on the 30th. Setting that item aside it will be seen that in Assam and North Bengal, the rainfall steadily increased between the 27th and the 30th, and that the dates of heaviest rainfall were the 29th and 30th. Proceeding southward from North Bengal the dates of heaviest rainfall are East Bengal June 30th, South-West Bengal June 30th and July 1st, Orissa July 1st, and the\nCircars July 2nd. Going westward we see that before June 30th, Bihar was practically rainless, and that there was no rain in the United Provinces, Punjab, and the Simla Hills, until July 1st. The dates of heaviest falls are July 2nd in Bihar, the 2nd and 3rd in the United Provinces, the 3rd in the Punjab, and the 3rd and 4th in the Simla Hills.\n\nIn Table X (a) I have merely added together the columns for the days 27th, 28th, and 29th, with the heading \"before 30th June\" and the columns for the days July 1st to 4th with the heading \"after 30th June.\" It will be seen that the heaviest falls occurred before the 30th June in Assam and Bengal, and after the 30th June in Lower Bengal, Orissa, the Circars and over the whole of North-Western India.\n\nIn addition to the provinces and divisions in the Table, I have given the rainfall at Darjeeling and Cherrapoonjee. The rainfall at these two stations agrees only partially with what is given for the plains of Bengal and Assam; and there is a striking difference between the falls at these places for the two disturbances. With the June storm, rainfall was comparatively light at both Darjeeling and Cherrapoonjee, while in August it was very heavy at both.\n\nThere appears to me to be no want of evidence, in the above Tables, in favour of the view that an atmospheric disturbance invaded India from the north-east, at the end of June. I may, however, give one or two further items of information showing the south-westward direction of progress over Bengal. They are only stray items, but they will indicate to some extent how the meteorological record might be improved, if there were some fore-knowledge of coming events and of the direction from which change should be looked for.\n\nAs the disturbance advanced over Bengal, thunderstorms probably occurred at places in succession. If so the fact has not been recorded. But I saw in the newspapers that a local storm of great severity had occurred between Nalhati and Rampur H\u00e2t, on June 29th, and I have ascertained that the hour when it overturned a train on that part of the E.I. Railway was between 3 and 4 o'clock in the afternoon. I personally observed the changes, as the wave passed over Calcutta, on the morning of the 30th and the traces of the self-recording apparatus, at the Alipore Observatory, show that it began about 4 A.M. on that date and was practically over by 10 A.M. When the weather was becoming more settled at Calcutta, that is about 10 A.M. I received a telegram from the observer at Saugor Island that weather was very unsettled there, that the barometer had fallen two-tenths of an inch, and that the wind was blowing 44 miles an hour. The following day I heard from a Calcutta resident who had just arrived from Madras that while the train on the East Coast Railway was passing through Orissa on the\nnight of the 30th, they had experienced very severe thunderstorms, with most vivid lightning. Though these are only stray facts, they indicate very clearly how the disturbance was advancing.\n\n**Table.**\n\n| Place          | Hour and date of local storm |\n|----------------|------------------------------|\n| Rampur H\u00e2t     | 3-30 P.M., June 29th         |\n| Calcutta       | 6-0 A.M. to 8 A.M., June 30th |\n| Sangor Island  | About 10 A.M., June 30th     |\n| Orissa         | About midnight, June 30th    |\n\nThe following Table gives the hourly changes of pressure from the barograph at Alipore Observatory, on June 30th.

(a rise followed by a fall) and that at noon the difference from the normal was the same as it had been at 4 A.M. The general appearance of the part of the trace from which the above measurements were taken is irregular and jagged without any marked sign of a depression, that is, the trace is of the kind characteristic of the passage of nor\u2019westers in the hot season.\n\nThe temperature changes show a steady decline from 4 A.M. until noon. The change, though not quite regular, is not of the sudden cha-\nracter of the fall accompanying thunderstorms. It was continuously falling throughout the period and that at a time, it may be observed, when in ordinary weather temperature is rising with the advancing day.\n\nTable giving temperature changes at Alipore observatory in degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n| On June 30th | Approximate normal | Difference |\n|--------------|--------------------|------------|\n| 4 A.M.       | 85\u00b02               | 80\u00b07       | +4\u00b05        |\n| 6 ,,         | 83\u00b00               | 81\u00b01       | +1\u00b09        |\n| 8 ,,         | 82\u00b08               | 83\u00b05       | -0\u00b07        |\n| 10 ,,        | 79\u00b05               | 86\u00b02       | -6\u00b07        |\n| 12 ,,        | 78\u00b05               | 87\u00b05       | -9\u00b00        |\n\nThe last column of the Table shows the large change of temperature which occurred between 4 A.M. and noon on the 30th June at Calcutta. It also shows indirectly how scanty, comparatively, would have been the information if the record had been limited to what is usually noted at 8 A.M. The temperature at that hour was practically normal.\n\nStorm of August 11th.\n\nThe Tables containing the information for the August disturbance have been prepared in the same way as those for the preceding storm and are given below in the same serial order for purposes of comparison. I stated in discussing the earlier storm that the pressure changes give an imperfect indication of the line of advance of the wave of change. From Tables I (b), II (b), V (b) and VI (b) it will be seen that the fall of pressure began in North Bengal on August 9th, that it extended southward over Bengal Proper and Orissa and westward as far as the Punjab on the 10th; and that while pressure was beginning to recover in North-East India on the 11th it was still falling in the United Provinces, the Punjab and Kashmir. The fall on the 11th, was very rapid at Teheran ('175\") and Ispahan ('150\"), showing that the centre of the wave had passed westward beyond the Indian region. The rapidity of this westerly movement is very little less than that of the earlier disturbance, and would probably have eluded observation if it had not been for the larger fall. The fall is first shown on the 9th in the north-east, and within 48 hours has passed far beyond the western boundary of India. The movement is also shown by the recovery\nwhich began on the 11th in Assam, and North Bengal, was rapid in North-Western India on the 12th and at Jask, Quetta, etc., on the 13th.\n\n**Table I (b).**\n\nGiving the pressure changes daily from August 8th to 14th, arranged to show the southward movement of the disturbance.\n\n|                | August 8 | August 9 | August 10 | August 11 | August 12 | August 13 | August 14 |\n|----------------|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Assam          | + '040\"  | + '004\"  | -

What I have attempted is to establish the general progress of the disturbance, pointing out that the part of India first affected was the north or north-east and that from the place of first contact the line of advance was southward and westward. The Tables for the second disturbance are very similar to those of the earlier one.\nand I propose commenting very briefly on the figures they contain. Tables III (b) and IV (b) give the temperature changes, and variation indicating the southward movement, and VII (b) and VIII (b) are similar Tables for the westward movement.\n\n**Table VII (b).**\n\n*Giving the temperature changes daily from August 8th to 14th, arranged to show the westward movement of the disturbance.*\n\n|                | August 8 | August 9 | August 10 | August 11 | August 12 | August 13 | August 14 |\n|----------------|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Assam          | -3\u00b0      | -0\u00b07     | -2\u00b08      | -2\u00b09      | -0\u00b06      | +3\u00b05      | +2\u00b08      |\n| North Bengal   | -0\u00b06     | -1\u00b09     | -0\u00b04      | -3\u00b04      | -1\u00b01      | +3\u00b03      | +1\u00b05      |\n| Bihar          | +0\u00b07     | -1\u00b00     | -0\u00b07      | -2\u00b08      | -0\u00b02      | +3\u00b00      | +0\u00b01      |\n| United Provinces| +1\u00b08    | -2\u00b05     | -0\u00b04      | +2\u00b00      | -1\u00b04      | +1\u00b00      | +1\u00b05      |\n| Punjab         | +3\u00b01     | +0\u00b02     | -1\u00b09      | -0\u00b09      | -5\u00b06      | -2\u00b06      | +3\u00b03      |\n| Srinagar, etc. | +2\u00b05     | +1\u00b01     | +0\u00b03      | -3\u00b00      | -7\u00b08      | -5\u00b04      | -0\u00b02      |\n\n**Table VIII (b).**\n\n*Giving the temperature variation from the normal from August 8th to 14th, arranged to show the westward movement of the disturbance.*\n\n|                | August 8 | August 9 | August 10 | August 11 | August 12 | August 13 | August 14 |\n|----------------|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Assam          | -0\u00b07     | -0\u00b08     | -3\u00b07      | -6\u00b04      | -6\u00b08      | -3\u00b04      | -1\u00b03      |\n| North Bengal   | +2\u00b01     | +0\u00b04     | +0\u00b01      | -3\u00b02      | -4\u00b00      | -0\u00b09      | +0\u00b02      |\n| Bihar          | +2\u00b09     | +1\u00b09     | +1\u00b03      | -1\u00b04      | -1\u00b02      | +1\u00b08      | +1\u00b08      |\n| United Provinces| +2\u00b04   | -0\u00b01     | -0\u00b06      | +1\u00b05      | +0\u00b02      | +1\u00b02      | +2\u00b08      |\n| Punjab         | +7\u00b00     | +7\u00b02     | +5\u00b05      | +4\u00b09      | -1\u00b00      | -3\u00b05      | -0\u00b01      |\n| Srinagar       | +4\u00b01     | +4\u00b09     | +4\u00b09      | +5\u00b02      | -3\u00b04      | -10\u00b05     | -10\u00b07     |\n| Leh            | +0\u00b09     | +2\u00b03     | +2\u00b00      | -1\u00b04      | -7\u00b05      | -14\u00b09     | -9\u00b07      |\nThe southerly movement is less marked than was the case in June. The fall of temperature began in Assam on the 10th, it extended to Bengal Proper on the 11th, and there was a slight fall in Orissa also on that date. But unlike the earlier disturbance, mean temperature did not fall below the normal in Orissa, and in the Circars temperature continued high throughout the period.\n\nFrom Tables VII (b) and VIII (b) it may be seen that the fall of temperature which began in Assam on the 10th, and North Bengal on the 11th, occurred in Bihar on the 11th, and in the United Provinces, Punjab, and Kashmir on the 12th. From Table VIII (b) in which the variation from the normal is given it may be seen that there was a very large defect in Assam on the 11th and 12th, and at Srinagar and Leh on the 13th and 14th.\n\nThe rainfall Tables IX (b) and X (b) show as before the heavy rainfall in Bengal Proper on the 11th, the heavy rain in Assam on the previous day the 10th, and that the days of heavy rainfall in the west of India were the 12th and 13th.\n\n**Table IX (b).**\n\n*Rainfall (August 8th to 14th).*\n### Table X (b)\n\n**Rainfall**\n\n| No. of Stations | Before 11th August | 11th August | After 11th August |\n|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|------------------|\n| Assam           | 5                 | 29\u00b708       | 12\u00b740            | 16\u00b705            |\n| North Bengal    | 7                 | 20\u00b786       | 29\u00b743            | 15\u00b783            |\n| East Bengal     | 7                 | 11\u00b704       | 28\u00b771            | 14\u00b722            |\n| South-west Bengal | 9               | 5\u00b705        | 15\u00b711            | 3\u00b746             |\n| Bihar           | 13                | 13\u00b754       | 12\u00b794            | 8\u00b746             |\n| United Provinces| 12                | 14\u00b739       | 1\u00b732             | 0\u00b733             |\n| Punjab          | 6                 | 0\u00b705        | 1\u00b731             | 2\u00b713             |\n| Simla Hills     | 5                 | 8\u00b746        | 2\u00b706             | 12\u00b737            |\n| Kashmir         | 6                 | 0\u00b746        | 1\u00b705             | 4\u00b703             |\n| Darjeeling      |                   | 1\u00b792        | 7\u00b791             | 1\u00b763             |\n| Cherrapoonjee   |                   | 34\u00b786       | 22\u00b771            | 6\u00b712             |\n| Orissa          | 4                 |             |                  |                  |\n| Circars         | 4                 |             |                  |                  |\n\nIt may also be seen that the rainfall was much more heavy at Darjeeling and Shillong than in June. At Darjeeling on the 11th nearly 8 inches fell, more than double the total fall for the three preceding and the three following days put together. At Cherrapoonjee 50 inches fell on the 10th and 11th taken together.\n\nThe only sensational incidents I have heard of in connection with this later storm were landslips in the Hills and heavy flooding of the rivers as the rainfall extended westward along the Himalayas.\n\nIf a comparison be made of the two sets of Tables, it will be seen that in many important respects the resemblance is as striking as two sets of meteorological Tables could almost be expected to be. The wave of pressure change in each case passed very rapidly, so much so that it is difficult to show the line of advance by the sequence of changes. The fall and the recovery were much greater in Western India in the latter than in the former. In each case the fall of temperature can be traced from East to West, but in the June storm the sequence is more complete.\nbecause of the change from intense hot weather in Bihar, the United Provinces and the Punjab, to the cooler weather of the monsoon season. Though the intermediate changes of temperature are less marked in August, there is abundant evidence of the line of advance of the wave of change; and the low temperature in Assam on the 11th and 12th, followed after an interval of two days by what may be called wintry weather in Kashmir, affords a succession of events which it would be difficult to account for, except on the supposition of a westward-moving atmospheric disturbance. But in my opinion the most striking similarity in connection with these two disturbances is afforded by the heavy general rainfall in Bengal Proper on the 30th June and the 11th August. In the latter case particularly, it is obvious that no disturbance entered Bengal from the Bay, which had been singularly calm throughout the week from the 8th to the 14th August. The wind direction at Diamond Island was westerly throughout the period, and velocity day by day was below the average for the season. In both cases, as shown by the following Table, there was considerable increase of wind force at Saugor Island; but the direction continued south-westerly, showing that the change was due to some influence to the north, and the record of the Pilot Brig shows that the strong winds extended to no great distance southward from the Bengal coast.\n\nTable giving the wind force and direction at Saugor Island during the two periods of disturbed weather.\n\n| June | Daily velocity in miles | Wind direction at 8 a.m. | August | Daily velocity in miles | Wind direction at 8 a.m. |\n|------|------------------------|--------------------------|--------|------------------------|--------------------------|\n| 27   | 312                    | S.S.W.                   | 8      | 360                    | S.W.                     |\n| 28   | 408                    | S.S.W.                   | 9      | 504                    | S.S.W.                   |\n| 29   | 576                    | S.S.W.                   | 10     | 768                    | S.                       |\n| 30   | 840                    | S.S.W.                   | 1      | 394                    | W.S.W.                   |\n| July |                        |                          |        |                        |                          |\n| 1    | 360                    | W.S.W.                   | 12     | 288                    | S.W.                     |\n| 2    | 456                    | S.W.                     | 13     | 384                    | W.S.W.                   |\n| 3    | 384                    | S.W.                     | 14     | 120                    | W.N.W.                   |\n\nOne difference which may be noted, as shown by the above Table, is that the highest velocity in the earlier disturbance occurred at Saugor\nIsland between the 10th and 11th, that is along with the heavy rainfall in Bengal Proper, whereas in the later disturbance it was between the 9th and 10th, or before the heavy rainfall. In other respects the resemblance is very striking, and the Table shows that with the fall of pressure in the north, the south-westerly wind increased and continued to increase until the recovery of pressure was complete. There is no sign with either disturbance of the northerly winds which invariably accompany a disturbance over the Bay.\n\nMr. C. C. Collingwood who was in command of the P.V. \"Alice\" at the Sandheads informs me that, from the 29th June to the 1st July, the brig was under way all the time, and that work went on as usual; also that there was very little sea-set. The weather was bright and clear, except from 8 A.M. of the 30th June to 10 A.M. of the 1st July. The following extract from the log for June 30th is given in full, because it shows the time at which the disturbance which passed over Bengal south-westward commenced at the Pilot Brig.\n\nExtract from the log of the P.V. \"Alice\" stationed at the Sandheads June 30th.\n\n| Hour | Pressure | Temperature | Wind direction | Wind force | Weather |\n|------|----------|-------------|----------------|------------|---------|\n| 2    | 29\u00b766''  | 88\u00b0         | S.W.           | 3          | bc      |\n| 4    | '63      | 88          | S.W. x W.      | 4          | bc      |\n| 6    | '67      | 88          | S.W.           | 3\u00b74        | bc      |\n| 8    | '73      | 89          | S.W.           | 3          | oc      |\n| 10   | '78      | 82          | S.W.           | 1\u00b72        | ocqlt   |\n| 12   | '76      | 80          | W.N.W.         | 3\u00b74        | oc      |\n| 14   | '74      | 81          | E.S.E.         | 1          | o       |\n| 16   | '66      | 84          | S.S.E.         | 1          | o       |\n| 18   | '66      | 84          | S.             | 3          | ocqlt   |\n| 20   | '68      | 83          | W.             | 3\u00b75        | ocl     |\n| 22   | '72      | 83          | S.W.           | 2\u00b73        | ocl     |\n| 24   | '68      | 83          | S.W. x W.      | 1\u00b72        | ocl     |\nThe change of temperature shows that the disturbance which had begun at 4 A.M. in Calcutta, reached the Pilot Brig between 8 and 10 A.M., and the column giving wind force shows that nothing more than a moderate breeze was experienced. The increase of cloud began about 8 A.M., and the sky was more or less overcast during the day.\n\nPART III.\n\nIn the preceding, which I have called Part II, I have considered only the weather changes, as they are indicated chiefly by the 8 A.M. observations from day to day during the period of disturbance. These are of sufficient interest to justify their separate consideration. But the two storms, which in what follows I shall represent by the dates June 30th and August 11th, appear to me to have caused a change so striking in the atmospheric conditions over Northern India, that those dates become punctuation marks in the monsoon season of 1902. The expression \"punctuation marks\" inadequately conveys my full meaning, and I would perhaps indicate more clearly the importance of the changes which then took place if I say that new chapters begin with those dates. It is impossible in the space which I now have at my disposal to go fully into the wider question which I am attempting to open out, even if I had the material ready. But I will indicate briefly the general run of the argument in order to form a line of connection with some future effort in this direction.\n\nA study of the monsoon season of 1902 falls naturally into four periods:\n\nA\u2014From the beginning up to the end of June, that is until the first Himalayan storm occurred.\n\nB\u2014From the 30th June to the 11th August, that is, from the first Himalayan storm up to the beginning of the second.\n\nC\u2014The three to four weeks which follow the 11th August, and during which the 'remarkable series of storms' moved from the Bay of Bengal north-westward to the extreme west of India.\n\nD\u2014The remaining part of the season, which I consider began with the storm which early in September broke up over the south-west of the Province instead of moving westward as the various members of the 'remarkable series' did.\n\nDuring each of these periods we have a well-defined behaviour of the cyclonic storms, and a well-defined distribution of rainfall. Also the connection between the line of advance of the storms and the prevalence of monsoon conditions is so striking that the study of the\nmonsoon is reduced to an enquiry why a cyclonic storm should move from the Bay of Bengal in one direction at one time of the year, and in another direction a week or two later; why it may be for several weeks at a time the prominent features of these storms are, more especially as regards the line of advance, repeated with but little variation; and why there should come without warning by ground level instruments a marked change in the line of advance.\n\nIn ordinary years cyclonic storms move westward, or slightly to the north of west\\(^1\\) from the beginning of the monsoon season, and while they follow the usual direction there is no want of rain in any part of Northern India. During the past five years cyclonic storms have been very far from following the usual course, that is the course which the previous fifteen or twenty years' experience had shown to be the usual course. For instance, in 1899 the recurving was very marked, especially in August and September; and there being no 'remarkable series of storms' such as occurred during the past year, the crops failed over wide areas in Western and Central India. Several storms developed in 1899 over the Bay at the most critical time, that is August, and began to move westward; but in every case their advance was checked over the Central Provinces, and they recurved towards Bengal, where in consequence rain fell in abundance. Contrast the past year with 1899, and the main difference will be found in the behaviour of the cyclonic storms in the latter part of August and the early part of September. No one who is interested in crops and rainfall can have forgotten how critical the condition had become in the west of India in August 1902; and how it was a question of days whether or not there would be a repetition of the disasters of 1899; and that just when it was not too late the change came, and came with the first of that 'remarkable series of storms' which was in the west of the Bay on the 19th of August and over the north-west dry area and Guzerat on the 22nd. Two more storms followed the same course at intervals of about a week, crossing the area of drought and giving plentiful rainfall where it was most needed.\n\nThe difference between the years 1899 and 1902 is that the storms of the second-half of August and first part of September in former\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In page 173 of the Hand-Book of Cyclonic Storms in the Bay of Bengal, Second Edition, Sir John Eliot says regarding cyclonic storms in July:\u2014\u201cThe charts shew that all the 89 storms which formed in the Bay during this month, in the period 1877-99, marched in west or west-north-west directions across the north-west angle of the Bay; and the centres of all with about six exceptions crossed the coast between Saugor Island and Gopalpur. In the great majority of cases they afterwards advanced across the head of the Peninsula into Sind, Guzerat or Rajputana.\u201d\nyear recurved over Central India and in the latter year they did not.\n\nAnd so it appears to me that this matter of the motion of cyclonic storms over Northern India is one urgently requiring explanation, and that so long as it is unknown in what direction a storm will move in the immediate future so long will the distribution of rainfall be a subject of speculation only. So great a difference as we find between the directions of motion of storms in the four periods of the past monsoon season must be due to well-defined causes which it must be possible to determine. The only point on which I feel any certainty is that these causes will not be determined by ground level observations. To me it appears much more likely that they are connected with overhead conditions, and the past season indicates that the cause may be found in an overhead current from the west, that is in its height and strength. This current is the main current over Northern India during the cold season and the early part of the hot season. It retreats upwards with the approach of the monsoon season and my opinion is that monsoon conditions cannot be established in Northern India so long as its strength is unimpaired.\n\nThe only effects which I am aware of as giving some indication of the strength of that current late in the season are the occurrence of late snowfall in the hills, and of late nor'westers in Bengal such as were experienced in June of last year. It is well known that for some years late snowfall in the hills has been put forward as indicating the late arrival of the monsoon, but I am not aware that there has been any connection established between the snowfall and the strength of the westerly overhead current. The reason for this doubtless is the great difficulty always experienced in any attempt to investigate the higher levels of the atmosphere\u2014a difficulty which is not to any extent removed by the establishment of observatories on ranges of high hills. It has come to be recognised by meteorologists that a high level observatory must be placed on the top of an isolated peak; otherwise the local irregularities of the ground, such as the spurs and valleys of the Himalayas, cause deviations in the record and the result is misleading.\n\nI have divided the monsoon season of 1902 into four periods\u2014June 30th being the division between the first and second and August 11th between the second and third of these periods\u2014and I will now state generally the line of advance of depressions from the Bay of Bengal during these periods.\n\nPeriod A.\n\nIn May a depression entered Burma, moving in a north-easterly direction, the usual one at that time of the year. In June there was at\ntimes a tendency to the formation of depressions over the north of the Bay, but it was temporary except about the 11th June, when the slight depression which then formed moved northwards into Bengal proper. The usual direction in which depressions advance in the middle of June is north-westward, and it is a fact worth noting that last year the depression which in ordinary years would have been followed by monsoon conditions over north-western India, moved into North Bengal instead, and that the monsoon weather was confined to Bengal Proper and Assam.\n\nPeriod B.\n\nTwo storms occurred during this period. They followed an almost identical course into Central India and then recurved towards the Kumaon Hills.\n\nThe following extracts from the Indian Daily Weather Report give the opinions recorded at the time regarding the change of motion and the place where it occurred.\n\n1st storm of Period B.\n\n- July 17th. \"The cyclonic storm will probably continue to advance in a west-north-westerly direction.\"\n- July 18th. \"The cyclonic storm from the Bay instead of continuing a westerly course has been almost stationary, and is apparently recurving to the north.\"\n- July 19th. \"The storm is apparently advancing towards the Kumaon Himalayas.\"\n\nIt may be noted that the change of direction which occurred between the 17th and 18th was not anticipated, showing that the information supplied by the ground level observations was not sufficient to settle the direction beforehand.\n\n2nd storm of Period B.\n\n- July 30th. \"The cyclonic storm has continued to advance slowly in a west-north-westerly direction and is now apparently central near Nowgong.\"\n- July 31st. \"The cyclonic storm in the Central India Plateau has been almost stationary during the past day, which may be an indication that it is about to change its direction of advance.\"\n- Aug. 1st. \"The cyclonic storm is apparently advancing to the Kumaon Himalayas.\"\n\nThe course is shown by the above extracts to be the same as in the preceding storm and it is also seen that the experience gained from the\nearlier storm made it possible on July 31st to anticipate to some extent the change of direction.\n\n**Period C.**\n\nA single extract from the *Indian Daily Weather Report*, of September 4th, will give the necessary information regarding the storms of this period.\n\n\"The present storm is the third of a remarkable series of storms which have formed in the Bay since the 19th August and have followed an almost identical course.\"\n\nThe first storm was over Guzerat or the north-west dry area, on August 22nd, the second on August 28th, and the third on September 3rd.\n\n**Period D.**\n\nWhat appeared to be a fourth in the above series was over the north-west of the Bay, on September 5th, and was expected to advance into the east of the Central Provinces during the next thirty-six hours, but it moved northwards, and on September 8th and 9th became diffused over West Bengal and the adjacent part of Central India. The following extracts are taken from the *Indian Daily Weather Report* because they support my contention already expressed, that recurving or in fact the direction of motion at any time is not directly indicated by the ground level observations of the day.\n\n*September 6th.*\u2014\"The storm at the head of the Bay is likely to advance into the east of the Central Provinces during the next thirty-six hours and will probably give moderate to heavy rain to Orissa, Chota Nagpur, West Bengal, and the east of the Central Provinces. Weather may become feebly unsettled in Kashmir within the next day or two.\"\n\n(Sd.) J. Murray,\n\nOffg. Meteorological Reporter to the Govt. of India and Director-General of Indian Observatories.\n\n*September 7th.*\u2014\"The storm at the head of the Bay has hardly changed in position during the past twenty-four hours and now shows a tendency to advance northwards into Bengal in which case rainfall will increase in Lower Bengal.\"\n\n*September 8th.*\u2014\"The cyclonic storm in Bengal will probably continue to advance in the same general northerly direction and give moderate to heavy rain in East and North Bengal and Assam.\"\n\nThe next storm in the Bay began towards the end of the third week of September and was well defined over the north-west angle on the 24th. From there it moved north-westward into Chota Nagpur, then northwards, and on the morning of the 26th was recurving towards\nthe Darjeeling Hills. It broke up on reaching the Himalayas, causing heavy rainfall in the eastern part of the range. A slight residual depression moved eastward into Assam.\n\nIt will be seen from the above extracts and remarks that the storms from the Bay during the monsoon season fall clearly into the four classes I have formed. Two in period (A) moved northwards; two in period (B) moved in the usual west-north-westerly course, but recurved over Central India towards the Kumaon Himalayas; three in period (C) moved west-north-westward, and without recurving passed over Guzerat and other parts of Western India where rain was much needed; and that the two storms in period (D) moved into Bengal; thus showing that, whatever the determining cause of the line of advance of these storms may be, it was in September becoming similar to what obtained in period (A) that is at the beginning of the season.\n\nThe question therefore is what cause would be sufficient to account for the change of motion in its various degrees shown by these storms of the past monsoon season. I know of only one, and that is the westerly wind overhead which is believed to cease before the monsoon commences, but which may continue in the higher levels after it has ceased near the ground. I was watching this wind very carefully last year, and believe it still existed over Lower Bengal as late as the last week of June, because typical nor\u2019westers occurred about that time. I believe also that the north-westerly wind returned earlier than usual at the end of the season, and was stronger than usual or in some other way differed from what it is in ordinary years, and my reason for thinking so is that nor\u2019westers occurred in October in Western Bengal, a most unusual event.\n\nAnother question is, why should the two storms from Central Asia, which I have discussed in the second part of this paper, influence that westerly current. I am unable to say why it should be so, but I think there can be no doubt, but that seasonal currents are often materially altered by what for want of a better word I will call the shock of a storm. The Rangoon cyclone early in May supplies an example of such a change. An examination of weather charts for April and May last year will show that the wind directions on the Burma coast were northerly up to the occurrence of that storm and that afterwards they had generally the south-westerly direction usual in the monsoon season.\n\nThe permanent change in the wind system on the Burma coast then produced is none the less instructive, because the north-westerly winds in April and May are believed to be a continuation of the very current which appears to me to have so much to do with the advent of the monsoon in different parts of Northern India, and in reasoning that the\nstorms from Thibet influence the overhead current so as to render the advent of the monsoon possible in the first case as far west as Central India and the Kumaon Himalayas, and in the second case to the extreme west of the empire I am making an assumption in support of which I believe numerous examples such as the Rangoon cyclone of 1902 can be cited. The influence of these storms from Thibet was in all probability greater in the upper reaches of the atmosphere than is shown by the ground level observations, because in the first place the storms were at a high level to begin with, owing to the Central Asian plateau, and in the second place the Himalayan range was an obstacle to their progress so serious that none but disturbances extending to a great height could have passed over them without complete disintegration.\n\nBefore closing I will refer very briefly to the storms which occurred in the Arabian Sea during 1902. They were only three in number. Two occurred in period (A), viz., the two Karachi cyclones and they moved in much the same direction as the two storms in that period from the Bay, that is, northward or north-eastward. The third occurred in July and was therefore in period (B). That storm appears to me to be very suggestive as to the circumstances in which monsoon conditions may be produced by a cyclonic storm. It entered Guzerat and the part of India which was most in need of rainfall. It, however, ceased to be a well-defined cyclonic disturbance, while still over Guzerat and though, a steep pressure gradient developed shortly afterwards over the whole of North-Western India and there were all the appearances which would suggest a strong inrush of monsoon winds with general rainfall, only a few showers fell and those near the coast. The weather produced by that depression, which was quite as deep as any one of the \"remarkable series\" in the third period, was dry hot weather, rather than monsoon weather.\n\nThe following extracts from the Indian Daily Weather Report, during the time of that disturbance will show that what I have stated above is borne out by the daily observations and also that it was difficult if not impossible to forecast the behaviour of the depression as regards the line of advance.\n\nJuly 6th.\u2014\"The low pressure area in the Arabian Sea is apparently still an ill-defined disturbance, and has not yet developed into a cyclonic storm.\"\n\nJuly 7th.\u2014\"The cyclonic storm in the Arabian Sea is apparently advancing towards the Kathiawar Coast.\"\n\nJuly 8th.\u2014\"The cyclonic storm in the Arabian Sea crossed the Kathiawar Coast yesterday afternoon and has apparently been almost stationary during the past eighteen hours. Its future course is un-\ncertain, but the character of the isobars and of the pressure changes, would appear to indicate the possibility of its advancing in a north-westerly direction.\"\n\n*July 9th.*\u2014\u201cThe cyclonic storm in Guzerat has been almost stationary during the past twenty-four hours.\u201d\n\n*July 10th.*\u2014\u201cThe storm in Kathiawar is filling up but will probably continue to give rain in Guzerat, during the next twenty-four hours.\u201d\n\n*On July 11th* no reference is made to the storm which was no longer shown by the ground observations and rainfall in India was confined to restricted areas.\n\nThe following Table, gives the rainfall in Guzerat, between the 6th and 11th July, and the amount which from the normal Tables was likely to fall during those days:\n\n|                | Actual rainfall between 6th and 11th July | Normal rainfall between 6th and 11th July |\n|----------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Surat          | ...                                      | 2\u00b717                                   | 3\u00b711                                   |\n| Ahmednagar     | ...                                      | 0\u00b770                                   | 1\u00b791                                   |\n| Bhavnagar      | ...                                      | 0\u00b765                                   | 0\u00b771                                   |\n| Veraval        | ...                                      | 6\u00b705                                   | 0\u00b776                                   |\n| Rajkot         | ...                                      | 0\u00b770                                   | 2\u00b728                                   |\n| Bhuj           | ...                                      | 1\u00b700                                   | 1\u00b718                                   |\n| Deesa          | ...                                      | 0\u00b732                                   | 1\u00b735                                   |\n\nIt will be seen that Veraval alone received excess rainfall, and that at three other stations, Ahmednagar, Rajkot, and Deesa, rainfall was much in defect.\n\nI have pointed out that the two storms from the Bay in period (B) recurved towards the Kumaon Hills, and that the storm from the Arabian Sea filled up in Guzerat after causing rainfall near the coast. In fact, that storm was very similar in its behaviour, to the first storm in period (D), which filled up in south-west Bengal, and it is not unlikely, that the filling up was due to similar causes, if these were only known. It may, therefore, be assumed that throughout period (B) there was some influence which prevented the advance of cyclonic storms, whether from the Bay of Bengal or from the Arabian Sea, into the north-west\ndry area. What change took place, before period (C), with its \"remarkable series\" of storms began, can be matter of surmise only, but I think it is fair to assume that it was not shown by the ground level observations, and that it may have been caused by the disturbance of August 11th, which entered India from Thibet, and which was so clearly shown in its advance along the Himalayan Range.\n\nI may be allowed to explain that I make no claim to have thrown, by this discussion, any light upon the complicated problem of the distribution of monsoon rainfall in Northern India. The connection between cyclonic storms and rainfall has for years been a matter of enquiry. I shall be satisfied if I have even partially succeeded in making out a *prima facie* case for an extension of meteorological observations to the upper atmosphere, feeling sure as I do that further information in that direction will meet requirements which ground level observations have hitherto failed to satisfy.\nOn the acquisition of alar appendages by the Spruce form of Chermes abietis-piceae MS. in the N.-W.

Stebbing, F.L.S., F.E.S.\n\n[Received 27th March 1903\u2014Read 1st April 1903.]\n\nIn July 1893, Mr. Smythies, late Conservator of Forests, Central Provinces discovered the winged form of a species of Chermes issuing from galls or pseudo-cones (see fig. d) on spruce (Picea Morinda) trees at Deoban in the Jaunsar Forests of the N.-W. Himalayas (elevation 9,200 ft.) Mr. Smythies stated that only immature forms were to be found in the galls in May and June, the first winged individuals observed issuing on July 21st. These insects were identified by Mr. E. B. Buckton, F.R.S., as the species Chermes abietis of Linn\u00e6us and Kaltenbach.\n\nThe above facts are recorded in Indian Museum Notes, Vol. III, No. 5, the species being noted as new to the fauna of India. I can find no further mention or data about this insect.\n\nIn May, June, and a portion of July, in 1901, and the latter part of May, all June, and half of July, in 1902, the writer toured through the Jaunsar and Simla Hill Forests, and whilst observations were noted on the habits of other insects, many quite new to science, a careful study was made of the Chermes. The notes then recorded are still far from complete, but the important and interesting discovery was made that whereas, as in Europe, the insect spends one generation of its life in pseudo-cones upon the spruce (Picea Morinda), the individuals of the alternative generation of the parallel series live, not upon the larch as in Europe, since the tree is not to be found in the N.-W. Himalayan Forests, but upon the silver fir (Abies Webbiana). Owing to this habit I call the insect Chermes abietis-piceae, MS., to distinguish it from the Chermes abietis-laricis of Europe. We shall here only concern ourselves with the acquisition of alar appendages and method of escape of the winged individuals from the galls found on the Spruce, leaving for a future paper full descriptions of the forms and habits of the other individuals of the parallel series of this most interesting insect.\n\nAs noted by Mr. Smythies, throughout June only small immature larvae are to be found within the false cones. In the first week of May I have found the eggs, laid in patches on the bark of the twigs and main stem of the tree by the winter female, to be abundant. Little purple larvae (see plate, fig. a) hatch out from these and slowly increase in size throughout the rest of May, June, and early days of July, by which date they become full-grown. An examination of the cone shows that even whilst still quite small it is partitioned off into chambers, figs. e, f, each con-\ntaining a number of the immature aphids. It differs, however, from the European one in the fact that it never has long portions of needles growing out of the centre of the diamond-shaped external portion of the covering of each chamber. It would appear as if the gall arising from the attacks of the larv\u00e6 of the *Chermes abietis-picea* was almost a stem growth and not a leaf one. And yet this is in all probability not the case. In the European form the formation of the gall is attributed to the young larv\u00e6 feeding at the bases of the young needles causing them to swell up at this point and coalesce, the upper part of the needle still continuing its growth. Thus the external covering of each chamber has the upper portion of a spruce needle, perhaps half an inch or more in length, growing out of its centre. No such long upper growth of needle is found in the Himalaya gall; but at times the centre of each diamond-shaped cover bears a tiny green spike which appears undoubtedly to be the upper extremity of the needle and thus proves that the gall arises in a similar manner to the European one. This point will be dealt with more fully in a subsequent paper. In fig. d a branch is shown bearing a typical set of the pseudo-cones containing nearly mature larv\u00e6 as they are invariably found in the N.-W. Himalayas. Fig. f shows an old last year's cone from which all the insects have escaped.\n\nThe year 1902 was a dry warm one up in the Himalayan region and therefore favourable to insect growth and development. Galls in sunny warm spots were found to be opening on the 10th July. The gall or false cone, in the process of what may perhaps be termed 'ripening,' changes from green to pale crimson; this takes place first on one side, after the manner of a ripening apple, and then all over, the cone often becoming bright crimson for a time, finally turning, when the insects are ready to emerge, a dull purple with the exception of a small patch or point in the centre of each of the diamond-shaped covers (where the needle would arise from in the European Spruce gall) which remains bright green.\n\nThe cone does not necessarily commence opening at the top: the small chambers may open anywhere all over it. The portions more exposed to the sun and in direct contact with warm air currents ripen first. An examination of the insects within the galls, just before the latter begin to open, will show them to be little thickish, puffy, wingless aphids, dull purple in colour and much ridged dorsally with greatly enlarged globose anterior coxae. Beneath the skin at each side of the mesothorax a small dull yellow excrescence can be seen and posterior to this, on the metathorax, also at either side, a dark longish, flatter protuberance. Legs and antenn\u00e6 are yellowish-green. Antenn\u00e6 are six-jointed. Length 2\u00b735 mm. Fig. b shows this fully grown larva.\nThis is the last stage of development of the insect within the gall, no functional alar appendages being present.\n\nIn opening the upper two edges or sides of the diamond-shaped outer covering of the chamber become detached at their points of juncture with the two lower sides of the cover of the chamber next above, thus forming a kind of lip, which can be forced open with forceps. The external surfaces of the diamond-shaped coverings then contract slightly, thus causing the aperture to permanently gape, the opening becoming wider and wider as the surface dries and consequently contracts (fig. f). The slit is at first quite narrow, but as soon as it appears the insects commence to crawl out. On reaching the outside of the false cone the fat purple larva at once undergoes its last moult. In doing this, the skin splits down a median line, both dorsally and ventrally; as far as the mesothorax dorsally, and the first or second pair of coxae ventrally; the insect then slowly crawls out leaving the white papery cast skin, to which are attached the dark-coloured leg and antennal cases, behind it.\n\nAfter this last moult it will be seen that the Chermes has undergone a great change.\n\nIt now appears as a small gorgeously-coloured aphid, with black shining head and prothorax, dark orange-brown shining meso- and meta-thorax, both dorsally and ventrally, and with a shining black abdomen. Legs and antennae bright canary yellow. On either side of the thorax two little bright-coloured bundles are visible, a bright naples yellow anteriorly and vivid apple-green posteriorly. The whole insect, in fact, is very highly coloured and looks at this stage as if it had just been freshly painted with the very brightest tints in Nature's colour box and then given a coating of varnish. As soon as the Chermes has freed itself from the last attachment of its last skin it begins to crawl actively about on the exterior surface of the gall and the little yellow and green bundles unfold and disclose the fact that they are the rolled-up alar appendages. As far as I could perceive, the insects themselves take no active part in unfolding these wings. They do not hang themselves up to get them unrolled as is the case with Lepidoptera, but simply walk about and under the influence of the sun and heat, the wings rapidly spread out, stiffen, and become functional. I noted that in many cases, even before the insect has entirely freed itself from the last larval skin, the little bundles had so far unrolled as to be quite distinct from one another. Within half an hour from the time of leaving the cone, the wings are fully unrolled, being held at an angle on the side of, but not meeting in a roof-shaped manner over, the abdomen. These wings are pale apple-green in colour with yellow nervures except at their juncture with the thorax where they are chrome-yellow.\n\nJ. ii. 9\nTotal length of insect with wings is 4\u00b768 mm. The wings project beyond the posterior end of the body about $1\\frac{1}{4}$ times the total length of the aphid. The *Chermes* is short, thickish, almost squarish in build and appears somewhat flatter after its final moult. The head is small; antenn\u00e6 six-jointed, the first joint very small, second and third small, fourth longest; prothorax broad and much channelled; the rest of thorax also broad the metathorax being sessile upon the abdomen. Fig. e, shows a dorsal and side view of the winged form.\n\nWithin one and a half hours of shedding the last skin, patches of white set\u00e6 begin to appear upon the aphid, and the meso- and meta-thorax turn from orange to shining black. These hirsute white patches appear on the head, upon each division of the thorax, and two little tufts, set side by side on each segment, run medianly down the dorsal surface of the abdomen. On the prothorax these white set\u00e6 are in a transverse ridge; on the meso- and meta-thorax they are in two large patches as on the abdomen. The wings become a paler green, the costal and median nervures being strongly marked and orange in colour, the transverse intersecting ones being silvery.\n\nThe insect by now, i.e., within three hours of its last moult, has lost all its brilliant colouring and has become dull and inconspicuous. It only differs from the winged form to be found at this period on the needles of the silver fir in having a green tinge in the wings, those of the silver fir fly being colourless but iridescent in certain lights.\nJOURNAL\nOF THE\nASIATIC SOCIETY OF BENGAL,\n\nVol. LXXII.

W. Peal, F.E.S.\n\n[Received 28th January, 1903. Read 4th February, 1903.]\n\nCHAPTER I.\nIntroductory.\n\nThe Aleurodidae are a family of the Homoptera which are allied to the well-known Coccidae or Scale Insects. Owing to their similarity to this family they are usually mistaken for such by Agriculturists and such mistakes can easily be excused owing to this family being so little known.\n\nThe Aleurodidae, like all the bugs, are sucking insects and derive their nourishment from plants by pumping up the sap by means of a proboscis formed of three fine setae. In the Coccidae the winged males (the females are unwinged) are destitute of mouth parts, but in the Aleurodidae the males and females both possess wings and the mouth parts and digestive organs are present. It is however in the immature and stationary stages that the greatest damage is done by these insects. In a country like India where there is practically a perpetual summer, these insects are present in great abundance and they are more destructive than in colder climates. This is due to there being a continuous succession of\ngenerations uninterrupted by winter, which in colder latitudes not only puts an end to their depredations for a season, but also seriously thins their numbers, thus acting as a very efficient check on an abnormal increase. Fortunately however for us the members of this family have not proved so prominently destructive as some of the Scale Insects, and probably this is the reason why hitherto they have been but little studied. Although not of pressing importance it must be admitted that their potential power for expansion and destruction is possibly even greater than that of the Coccidae. Although not possessing limbs in the early and more destructive stages\\(^1\\) as in some Coccids (like the Monophlebin\u00e6) still their power of dissemination is greater as, owing to the females being winged and capable of prolonged flight, they can be more easily spread. Thus in a plantation their spread would take place quicker than Scale Insects. As a matter of fact it is rare, when several plants of the same species are grouped together, to find only one or two showing traces of this pest; as a rule the entire clump is affected.\n\nSo far only six species belonging to the family Aleurodidae have been described from India. This it must be admitted is a poor record. When we turn to the Coccidae we see however that even this important family had been till only recently entirely neglected. Now, thanks to the admirable work of Mr. E. E. Green, the number of our recorded Indian Species of the Coccidae has risen from seven in 1886 to fifty-two in 1901, and this even is only a tithe of those which will be discovered in time and worked up. The case of the Aleurodidae is similar or even worse; as latterly, after the death of Mr. Maskell of New Zealand, no one has done any work on the Indian forms. India in reality is exceedingly rich in members belonging to this family. In the short space of time that I have been working up the Aleurodidae I have examined nearly fifty species. Mr. Green has sent me twenty-eight species from Ceylon, one species from Java and two species from Victoria for determination.\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nCollection and Preparation.\n\nAs the habits of members of this family are so similar to those in the Scale Insects the method of collection and preparation is identical or almost so in the case of both. The only disappointment one may meet in collecting is the far larger number of scale insects one is inveigled into examining. It is impossible to give any definite instructions as to the method of searching for these insects, but the few following notes as to\n\n\\(^1\\) Except the very first stage and then their power of movement is not very great, the larvae usually moving but a short distance from the egg.\nmy method of collecting may be of use. I carry a large number, a dozen suffices, of fairly long and narrow envelopes. These envelopes are all that is required for the collection of larv\u00e6 and pup\u00e6.\n\nOne soon gets quite expert in noticing the signs which betray the presence of these insects. A spotted yellow leaf, a black deposit of fungus on the upper surface of the leaf, a procession of ants, these and many other little signs are soon picked up. Always search the older and more mature leaves rather than the young foliage, nor should one overlook the dead and withered leaves which lie on the ground. The insects are almost invariably attached to the under-surface of the leaves.\n\nFor collecting the adults use small phials. The insects themselves must be picked up with a fine camel hair brush the tip of which has been previously moistened.\n\nAfter collecting as many larv\u00e6 and pup\u00e6 as are required, make what notes you wish on the envelope itself. The following at least should be entered. Name of tree, colour of insect, character of fluff if any, the comparative abundance of the insect, locality and date. If the tree cannot be recognised carry away some of the leaves and if possible flowers for identification by a botanist.\n\nAs soon as possible after reaching home the insects should be examined and sorted, and if possible mounted. When the insects are dry it is impossible to examine the first larval stage satisfactorily as the legs and antenn\u00e6 shrivel up.\n\nFor examination one will find that powers of $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{1}{4}$, and $\\frac{1}{6}$ are usually sufficient. A camera-lucida for making the drawings is almost indispensable. After cleaning a microscope slide, drop some dilute Canada balsam on it; examine the leaves with a hand lens, and with a fine pin moistened if necessary with turpentine, pick up a few eggs and transfer them to the slide. Next search for larv\u00e6 of the first stage. This is somewhat difficult as they are usually only about 2 mm. in length. Do not be content with one or two specimens, mount several. Pick up the other larval stages present and also some of the pup\u00e6. If the insects are very dark one will have to boil them in caustic potash before mounting. The following is the method. Half fill a fairly long test-tube or watch glass with an almost saturated solution of caustic potash, drop in one insect and boil over a spirit lamp or gas jet. When sufficiently transparent remove the specimen with a piece of wire or a hair spring into a small dish of water. After soaking out the caustic potash mount the specimen in a drop of glycerine. I however find that with black species, if one mounts specimens in dilute Canada balsam, and the slide is put away for some time, the insects as a rule become transparent enough to be\nexamined for fine details. Those species which have the dorsum covered with spines should be mounted under a cover glass raised above the slide by a cork or metal ring. The cover glass is thus kept some distance from the insect itself. It is impossible however in this case to examine with very high powers. The winged insect should be mounted as soon as possible, as it is impossible to make out the details in a shrivelled specimen. I find Canada balsam excellent for mounting them, but it is advisable to stain some of the insects first. It will be found somewhat difficult to mount the adult so as to show the wings to advantage. I find that by placing the insect on the slide, when the balsam is somewhat hardened, gentle pressure on the head with a fine pin will cause the body to slip backwards and leave the wings spread out evenly. If this is found difficult, an alternative method is to carefully cut off the wings with a fine scalpel, the operation meanwhile being watched with a hand lens. As a rule it will be found that Canada balsam is not suited for those species in which the wings are banded, as the bands show but faintly. In this case mount dry by making a ring of balsam and after placing the wing in the centre, pressing on a small cover glass. Keep a fairly large number of the insects in situ on the dry leaves and also some of the winged insects in empty phials or if preferred in spirit.\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nPREVENTIVE MEASURES.\n\nI do not think it will be out of place to describe shortly such preventive measures as are useful in eradicating or at any rate keeping down these pests. These insects cannot be killed by means of any of the poisons ordinarily used against mandibulate insects, as they exist by pumping up sap from within the leaves by means of their set\u00e6. The most convenient all-round remedy is the well-known kerosine emulsion which when sprayed on the plants kills the insect by closing up the spiracles. It is true that these insects are extensively parasitized by chalcids and their numbers thus kept down; but despite this check these pests often get out of hand and do extensive damage. The causes which lead to this result are varied. It may be that as in the case of most cultivated plants, their natural food-plant may be largely increased and thus sufficient pabulum be provided; or seasons may be favourable. In this case the pests' increase would be short-lived, as the parasite being provided with plenty of food, would soon increase and reduce the pest to something like its old numbers. If, however, the pest is unwittingly imported with its food-plant into a new country and its natural parasite or parasites be left behind at home, it is possible\nthat the pest may increase amazingly and do extensive damage. In this case its natural parasite being absent, the most suitable remedial measure would naturally be a search for and importation of the parasite. Care would have to be taken of course that no hyperparasites were imported as well. In my opinion I think it may be taken for granted that in its native habitat and under the check of its parasites, a pest cannot ordinarily, without other assistance, be eradicated by means of these natural parasites, as the balance has been adjusted after many generations of struggle between the parasite and its victim.\\(^1\\) In the case however of an imported parasite the case is quite different; the environment, climatic conditions, abundance of food and the like will be different from that in its native habitat and the pest will take some time to settle down in its new home. While in this as it were transitory stage the parasite (imported without its own parasites) will probably have a far greater power to check the pest.\n\nI have never observed lady birds feeding on any of these insects but it is possible that they do so.\n\n**CHAPTER IV.**\n\n**Characters and Classification.**\n\nThe Aleurodidae are a family of insects belonging to the Order Hemiptera, Suborder Homoptera.\n\nCharacteristics of the family:\n\n**Adult.** Furnished with four wings in both sexes. Sucking and digestive organs present. Eyes usually constricted or reniform, sometimes completely divided. An ocellus above each eye. Antennae seven jointed. Tarsi dimerous and furnished with three claws. Fore wings with one median and one basal vein (in the genus *Aleurodicus* there is also a terminal vein). The wings usually white, sometimes spotted or banded with red or grey. The surface of the wings mealy.\n\n**Puparium.** Scale-like. Brown, black or yellow in colour. The dorsum sometimes covered with a waxy secretion. The most important characteristic is the vasiform orifice described below.\n\n**Larva.** 1st stage. Shape elliptical. Furnished with short stout legs and antennae. The other larval stages similar to the puparium or last quiescent stage.\n\n**Egg.** The eggs are bean shaped, curved and are attached to the leaf by a short peduncle or stalk.\n\nIn the adult stage these insects can be distinguished from the\n\n\\(^1\\) It cannot, we think, be said that there is ever a 'struggle' between the parasite and its host; the lessened food supply available for the former is entirely brought about by its own actions. Hon, Edit.\nCoccids by their possessing four wings to the latter's two, and from the Psyllids by the venation of the wings. The fore wings of the latter family are supplied with several veins while in the Aleurodidae there are only two (or in some cases three). In the larval and pupal stages they can be distinguished from both the Coccidae and Psyllidae by the presence on the dorsal surface of the last segment of the abdomen of a triangular or subelliptical opening (also present in the adult) known as the vasiform orifice. This orifice has hinged to it anteriorly a plate or flap known as the operculum. This operculum projects and covers to some extent the opening of the vasiform orifice. There is besides in nearly every case a narrow tongue-like organ which lies within the vasiform orifice and which projects caudad more or less into or beyond the vasiform orifice. This is the organ which produces the honey-dew.\n\nThe family is divided into two genera: *Aleurodes* and *Aleurodicus*. The species belonging to the genus *Aleurodicus* have with one exception been all described from the warmer parts of America.\n\n**Genus Aleurodes.**\n\nAdults with only one branch (basal) from vein of forewing. Hind wing with a single vein.\n\n**Genus Aleurodicus.**\n\nAdults having the vein in both wings with a distal and basal branch.\n\nIn a recent work by Mr. T. D. A. Cockerell (Proc. Acad. Philadelphia, May 1902, p. 279), these two genera are divided into several subgenera. I will deal with these subgenera later on when classifying our Indian species. As regards the bibliography, the principal works dealing with this family are Dr. V. Signoret's papers in the Journal of the Entomological Society of France, 1867 and 1883; Mr. W. M. Maskell's papers in the Transactions of the New Zealand Institute 1889, 1890, and 1895; and Mr. A. L. Quaintance's \"Contributions toward a study of the American Aleurodidae,\" (U.S. Dept. Agri. Technical Series No. 8). From these works the complete bibliography can be obtained.\n\nBoth Mr. Maskell and Mr. Quaintance have put forward a plea for describing species belonging to the family, not only from the adult insect, but also from the larva and pupa. However objectionable such a practice is in the case of other insects it is perfectly valid in the case of the Aleurodidae. Though in some cases it is true that the perfect insects do differ in some small particulars, such as the occasional presence of spots and bands on the wings, it is practically impossible in most cases to differentiate species from this stage alone. In the larval and pupal stages on the other hand there is a considerable diversity of\nform and colour and in the character of the waxy secretion. It also happens that generally when these insects are collected, only the larvae and pupae are sent for examination, as these are the stages in which damage is done to plants. If however the adult \"flies\" are obtained, they should always be described, particularly the colour of the wings, as although in most cases they are white some species have the wings more or less spotted with brown or red.\n\nI have gone somewhat into detail in describing the different larval stages. It is difficult except in some few cases to be absolutely sure as to the number of moults. I have however but little doubt that the normal number is four excluding the pupal stage. This I have made certain of in some species but it is of course impossible to find out the number in many cases as material sent usually consists of only one or two of the stages.\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF 7 NEW SPECIES OF Aleurodes.\n\nAleurodes religiosa n. sp. Plate V, figs. 6-9.\n\nSignoret in his \"Essai Monographique sur les Aleurodes\" (Ann. Soc. Ent. France Ser. 4, VIII, 1868), describes and figures an Aleurodid he obtained from Rubus fruticosus and which he named A. rubi. This species is distinguished from A. longicerae, Walk. by minute differences in the adult insect, the larval (really pupal) state, which he figures being identical except that as he says \"sur la ligne mediane on observe sur chaque segment abdominal une impression plus visible a la base qu'au sommet.\" In allied species the differences in the adult stage are extremely minute and it is hardly safe to rely on these differences alone in defining a species.\n\nA. religiosa is undoubtedly closely allied to these two species possessing as it does the same series of spines on the dorsum. It however differs in having in addition another pair of spines placed fairly close together on the cephalic region, caudad of the outer and longer pair on cephalic region. It also has two yellow ridges one on each side of the vasiform orifice. The caudal half of the dorsum is narrower than the cephalic half and the margin caudad is slightly incurved. The cephalothoracic margins are also incurved the surrounding area being suffused with yellow. The indentures also bear a short fragmentary fringe of wax.\n\nI have described this species in detail as Signoret gives no detailed description of the vasiform orifice. His drawing shows that it is probably identical or almost identical (but smaller in proportion) to that in A. religiosa; he does not deal with the earlier stages at all, nor does he give\nany measurement. I have found *A. religiosa* fairly common on some pepul and banyan plants in Calcutta. So far however I have been able to obtain it from only one locality. The larvae and pupae are usually to be found on the same leaves as *A. quaintancei*.\n\nAll stages can be obtained at the same time and from off the same leaf, but one or two stages always largely predominate. In the middle of November pupae, adults and eggs can be obtained in abundance but the larval stages are scarce.\n\n**Egg.** Size '16 mm. \u00d7 '06 mm.\n\nLight yellow when first laid turning light-brown afterwards. Peduncle short about '025 mm. in length; surface minutely sculptured with hexagons. The adult female when laying eggs moves in the segment of a circle, the leaf being whitened by the white meal from the undersurface of the abdomen.\n\n**Larva 1st stage.** Size '18 mm. \u00d7 '1 mm.\n\nElliptical, narrow for its length. Colour light yellow, eyes maroon. Legs and antennae present. One long seta on centre of each tibia of second and third pair of legs. One long seta on tarsi of all legs. Antennae apparently six-jointed the last joint short and slender. Two long caudal setae and two short setae caudo-laterally on margin. There is a narrow fringe of wax around the margin.\n\n**Larva 2nd stage.** Size '16 mm. \u00d7 '09. mm.\n\nElliptical, narrow for its length. Colour light yellow. Two darker yellow pigment patches on abdominal region. Eyes maroon, fairly broad waxy fringe right around margin. Dorsum slightly elevated especially along centre of abdominal region. Abdominal segments distinct along dorsum. Two long setae on second segment of abdomen. Two long setae caudad on margin. Length of latter pair '1 mm. Two shorter setae on caudo-lateral margin. Region round vasiform orifice slightly tinged with yellow. Vasiform orifice relatively large in this stage, shape conical, apex pointing caudad. Anterior edge flat, posterior edge slightly flattened; lateral margins upper edge convex lower edge concave. Operculum brown: anterior and posterior margins flat, lateral margins convex. Length not quite half that of the vasiform orifice. Colour brown, surface covered with fine hairs. Lingula two jointed the first joint short and broad, the second joint narrow broadening out to a conical tip: the surface covered with fine hairs. The lingula projects almost half its length beyond the operculum, the tip extending almost to the lower edge of the vasiform orifice. Legs present but short and rudimentary; antennae obsolete. The marginal fringe of wax rises from a series of pores just above and within the dorsum. At each segment of the abdomen and about the same distances apart on the cephalo-\nthoracic region there are two larger pores which produce larger filaments of wax and so more or less break up the otherwise uniform stretch of fringe.\n\nLarva 3rd stage. Size '35 mm. \u00d7 '21 mm.\n\nShape elliptical, broadest cephalad tapering gradually caudad. Cephalothoracic margins incurved. Colour light yellow: two yellow pigment patches on abdomen. Area around indentures on cephalothoracic margins and around vasiform orifice suffused with yellow. Eyes maroon. Dorsum slightly elevated, especially along the abdominal region. Segments of abdomen very distinct along centre of dorsum; they cannot be distinguished near margin. A short fringe of wax all around margin. It is relatively narrower than that in the preceding stage. There are two set\u00e6 on the second segment of the abdomen: two extremely fine long set\u00e6 '2 mm. in length, just within the margin at incurved cephalothoracic areas and two sightly shorter set\u00e6 caudad on margin. All these set\u00e6 spring from small tubercles. Vasiform orifice and its appendages similar to that in the preceding stage. There are, however, two fairly long set\u00e6 near end of lingula.\n\nLarva 4th stage. Size '44 mm. \u00d7 '3 mm.\n\nCaudal extremity of vasiform orifice flat. There is a narrow marginal fringe of wax. The rest substantially as in puparium. The lateral margins of the operculum in this stage and in the pupa are flat, angled inwards to meet posterior margin: upper edges curved to meet anterior margin: they are not convex as in the other stages of the larva. There is a series of small pores along ventral surface of margin. These produce a small quantity of wax. The margin is fairly broad.\n\nPuparium. Size '56 mm. \u00d7 '35 mm.\n\nShape elliptical, broadest cephalad. Lateral cephalothoracic and caudal margins incurved. Colour yellowish, semi-transparent under the microscope. Two yellow pigment patches on abdomen: light yellow-brown areas around cephalothoracic and caudal indentures. There is an extremely short scanty fringe of wax at indentures; no trace of a fringe elsewhere on margin. Dorsum elevated, surface granular, abdominal segments fairly distinct. Dorsum covered with several long set\u00e6 which spring from small tubercles. They are situated one pair cephalad some distance from the margin; slightly caudad of these a second shorter pair in which the set\u00e6 are placed rather close together; one pair on prothorax at inner edge of yellow-brown areas running from the incurved thoracic margins; a pair on metathorax; a pair fairly close together on first segment of abdomen; a pair on fourth segment of abdomen; a pair one on each side of the vasiform orifice, and a pair caudad just within the margin.\n\nJ. ii. 11\nVasiform orifice long, in the shape of a narrow cone; apex pointing caudad. Cephalic margin flat, corners rounded. Connecting the vasiform orifice to the incurved area on caudal margin is a narrow groove or channel. This channel and the sides of the vasiform orifice are bounded by two yellow, rounded fleshy ridges which run from the upper corners of vasiform orifice caudad to margin. On the end of these ridges are the two tubercles from which the caudal set\u00e6 spring. Edge of vasiform orifice light brown. Operculum similar to that in previous stages but lateral margins flatter; but little more than \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\)rd. length of vasiform orifice. Colour light-brown, caudal margin darkest; surface covered with fine hairs. There are near the tip two fairly long hairs which project caudad.\n\nParasited pup\u00e6 become very convex, dark coloured and in some cases turn quite black.\n\nAdult female. Length '8 mm. Wing '85 mm. \\( \\times \\) '31 mm.\n\nColour light-yellow; dorsal surface of thorax tinged with brown. Legs light-yellow; eyes maroon, almost divided, lower half larger. Wing immaculate powdered with white meal. Length of antenn\u00e6 '22 mm. Formula 3, 2, 7, 5, 6, 1, 4. Joint 1 short, broad for its length; joint 2 subpyriform, nearly twice the length of joint 1; joint 3 twice the length of joint 2; joint 4 one-fourth length of joint 3; joint 5 one-and-a-half times the length of joint 4; joint 6 slightly shorter than joint 5; joint 7 nearly one-and-a-half times the length of joint 6. Vasiform orifice cordate, anterior edge flat. Rim of vasiform orifice tinged with yellow. Operculum in the form of a narrow neck which broadens out into a wide bilobed tip. The posterior margin incurved. Operculum faintly tinged with yellow. Lingula long, fairly stout, conical at tip; setose, the end extends almost to the inferior edge of the vasiform orifice; colour yellow.\n\nAdult male. Length '72 mm. Wing '74 mm. \\( \\times \\) '25 mm. Antenn\u00e6 '2 mm. Formula of antenn\u00e6, shape of vasiform orifice, etc., as in female.\n\n*Aleurodes bengalensis* n. sp. Plate II, Figs. 10\u201316.\n\nEgg. '2 mm. \\( \\times \\) '1 mm.\n\nColour reddish-brown under the microscope, dark claret colour under a hand lens. Surface covered with meal. The eggs are usually laid in a more or less perfect ring.\n\nFor want of material the first, second, and third larval stages have been described from empty skins and in some cases dead and dried individuals. I will describe them later on in detail when these stages can be obtained. Just now, Nov. 20th, pup\u00e6 and adults are fairly plentiful and larvae 4th stage scarce, no living examples of any of the other\nlarval stages being obtainable. Large quantities of the cast off skins can however be obtained, which is rather unusual amongst these insects.\n\nThe insects are present on the leaves in colonies of from half a dozen to several hundred individuals. The location of a colony can be easily ascertained owing to the peculiarly whitened appearance of the leaf wherever a colony has planted itself. This white is the meal from off the adults. I observed no parasited pup\u00e6.\n\nLarva 1st stage. Size '2 mm. \u00d7 '1 mm.\n\nShape elliptical. Yellow pigment patch on centre of abdomen. A fairly broad marginal fringe of wax. There are 26 spines on dorsum, all around and some distance from the margin. Two series of pores around the margin; difficult to make out but apparently as in later stages. Two long set\u00e6 caudad on margin. Two short set\u00e6 caudolaterally on margin. The vasiform orifice opens directly on the surface of the dorsum. Shape cordate; anterior edge flattish; edge tinged with yellow. Operculum yellow, similar in shape to the vasiform orifice only narrower being broader than long. Anterior and posterior margins flattish. The operculum extends only a little further than centre of vasiform orifice. Lingula short, broad, constricted in the middle to form a flat broad basal end and a spatulate tip. About half the lingula projects beyond the operculum. Colour of lingula brownish yellow. There appear to be no pores placed centrally on the abdominal segments as in later stages.\n\nLarva 2nd stage. Size '65 mm. \u00d7 '43 mm.\n\nShape elliptical. A large brown patch on abdomen extending from the first to the sixth segment. Area around vasiform orifice tinged with brown. There are 26 set\u00e6 around and slightly within the margin. Caudad on margin 2 set\u00e6. Two shorter set\u00e6 caudolaterally on margin. These 4 set\u00e6 are placed on a lower plane than the marginal ring of set\u00e6. There is a fairly broad marginal fringe of wax. There are two marginal series of pores situated apparently as in pupa. Of the central double row of abdominal pores present in the pupa only the pair on the first and second segments present. There are rows of extremely minute pores on each segment of the abdomen placed centrally and extending about one-third the width of the dorsum. These pores tend to be disposed in rows but are very irregularly placed. The fourth, fifth, and sixth segments have the largest number.\n\nVasiform orifice placed in a depressed pit. The pit proportionately far smaller than that in the pupa, the vasiform orifice nearly filling it. Anterior and posterior edges of pit flat, sides convex. The lateral and posterior edges slope inwards. The vasiform orifice situated in a clear\nspace, the edges of the space being demarcated by a dark line; rest of pit yellowish brown. Vasiform orifice similar in shape to pit, edges dark brown. Operculum broader than long, anterior edge flat, posterior edge concave, sides convex; colour brown. It extends to a little beyond centre of vasiform orifice. Lingula broad for its length, dumb-bell-shaped, being constricted in centre, tip spatulate. It projects for about half its length beyond operculum; colour brown.\n\nLarva 3rd stage. Size '76 mm. \u00d7 '46 mm.\n\nApparently similar to the 4th stage.\n\nLarva 4th stage. Size '85 mm. \u00d7 '5 mm.\n\nShape as in pupa. A short marginal fringe of wax. Vertical fringe short. Dorsum much blotched with black. Rest apparently as in pupa.\n\nPuparium. Size 1'1 mm. \u00d7 '68 mm.\n\nShape elliptical, narrower cephalad, the margin being rather abruptly incurved at thorax. Margin caudad flattish. Cephalothoracic area lemon yellow, later turning to orange. Last three segments of the abdomen up to vasiform orifice orange. There is a clear space between these two patches. Two irregular longitudinal grey bands on anterior segments of the abdomen just without the central double row of pores. A broad edging of black around cephalothoracic margin. This is in some cases interrupted so as to form three separate patches, one cephalic and two thoracic. The cephalic patch is divided into two by a narrow yellow band which connects the cephalic margin to central yellow area. A black edging on margin caudad. Caudolateral margins more or less blotched with black. Rest of body of a cream white colour. The grey edging on margin is not at all constant, it varying a good deal. As the insect within develops the markings gradually disappear. They disappear very irregularly, in many cases blotches disappearing from one side before the other. The caudolateral marginal blotches disappear first. The suture between thorax and abdomen sometimes apparent as a fairly broad transparent band. There are 26 set\u00e6 right around dorsum; they are set just within the margin. The upper end of each seta for about one-third of its length surrounded with a quantity of fluffy wax. Of these set\u00e6 14 are situated on the abdominal and 12 on the cephalothoracic region. The spines are comparatively short; colour light brown. Two long set\u00e6 caudad on margin on a slightly lower plane than the marginal fringe of spines. Mesad of the marginal spines there are present on the dorsum two series of large pores an inner and an outer series. There are in all 28 pores in the outer series, 12 on the abdominal and 16 on the cephalothoracic region. The pores on the abdominal segments are situated,\none on each side near margin of 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th segments and two on 7th. There are 26 pores in the inner series, 14 on the abdominal and 12 on the cephalothoracic region. The abdominal pores are situated two on each side near margin of the 3rd segment, one on each side near margin of 4th, 5th, and 6th segments and two similarly placed on the 7th segment. There are also two rows of similar pores down centre of dorsum on the abdominal segments. The rows are placed fairly close together. There are in all 6 pores in each row, 1 pore of each row being placed on abdominal segments 1 to 6. The pores are large, rims slightly elevated above dorsum. All the pores secrete globules of liquid. Ventrally on margin a series of fine pores which secrete a quantity of wax. This fringe of wax is vertical and about 1.5 mm. in length. It elevates the pupa off the leaf. The vasiform orifice is prominent and is extremely characteristic. It is situated in a large depressed pit. The pit is conical apex pointing caudad. Apical and basal margins flat, the apical margin being if anything a trifle incurved. Lateral margins rounded, basal ends being curved to meet basal margin. Sides from centre to near apical margin flat, then sharply incurved to meet apical margin. Edges dark brown, an outer edge of light brown. The sides slope inwards. Apical end of pit shallow, the floor sloping down to the anterior end at which point the pit is deepest. Floor of pit highly rugose, with seven dark wavy brown lines forming the demarcations of the ridges. These ridges vary in different individuals. A clear light yellow area around vasiform orifice. Vasiform orifice oval, posterior margin slightly incurved. Anteriorly the margin projects beyond and can be seen below basal edge of pit, showing that the pit's basal edge overhangs at the top. Edge of vasiform orifice tinged with brown. Operculum two-thirds the length of the vasiform orifice. Anterior margin flat, posterior margin slightly concave, sides convex, the curve being somewhat angular. Colour light brown. Lingula spatulate at tip. Only the tip projects beyond the operculum, it is the only part which can be distinguished. Colour brown. Legs of adult can be distinguished through ventral surface. Appearance much the same as that shown in the description of *A. citri*. When the adult is emerging from the pupal case its thorax is of a bright deep orange colour.\n\nAdult female. Length 1 mm. Wing 1.15 mm. \u00d7 0.42 mm.\n\nColour light orange; surface of the body dusted with a large quantity of white meal. Eyes maroon, almost divided. Wings immaculate, covered with white meal. Legs and antenn\u00e6 white, tinged with yellow, dusted with white meal. Antenn\u00e6 3 mm. in length. Formula 4, (2, 3,) 5, 7 (1, 6). Joint 1 short, flat; joint 2 stout, subpyriform; joint 3 thin, cylindrical, equal in length to joint 2; joint 4 slightly longer than\njoint 3, joint 5 short, only two-thirds length of joint 4: joint 6 short, little more than one-third length of joint 5: joint 7 twice the length of joint six. Vasiform orifice somewhat square, broader than long, posterior edge widest, anterior edge flattish, posterior edge slightly convex: lateral edges flat and angled outwards. Margin of vasiform orifice slightly tinged with brown: inner area semitransparent. Operculum flattish, broader than long: only about one-third length of vasiform orifice. Anterior and posterior margins concave, lateral margins convex. The upper corners are the only parts of the operculum which touch the vasiform orifice. Colour brown. Lingula long, cylindrical, two jointed, first joint shortest. The lingula projects nearly half its length beyond the vasiform orifice.\n\nAdult male. Length '9 mm. Wing '85 mm. \u00d7 '31 mm. Antenn\u00e6 '25 mm.\n\nLong silky fluff on abdomen as in A. citri. This is only present in recently emerged individuals.\n\nAleurodes alcocki n. sp. Plate II, Figs. 1-9.\n\nEgg. Size '2 mm. \u00d7 '1 mm.\n\nColour light yellow brown. It stands upright on leaf to which it is attached by a peduncle about '04 mm. in length. The egg is curved, surface sculptured with minute hexagons.\n\nLarva 1st stage. Size '27 mm. \u00d7 '16 mm.\n\nShape elliptical, extremely narrow for its length. Provided with antenn\u00e6 and legs. Colour whitish, semitransparent under the microscope. Margin minutely crenulated. There is a series of closely apposed marginal pores which secrete a short regular fringe of wax. Four fairly long set\u00e6 caudad on margin. Caudolaterally on margin eight extremely short set\u00e6 (four a side) placed equidistant and forming a regular continuation of the four long caudal set\u00e6. Cephalad there are marginally twelve (six a side) set\u00e6 which extend around the cephalothoracic margin. Vasiform orifice slightly elevated, conical, apex pointing caudad. Operculum semicircular, flat anteriorly, almost filling up vasiform orifice. Colour brown, surface covered with fine hairs. Lingula extremely short, cylindrical, about half the length of the operculum beneath which it is hidden. Legs stout; tibiae of second and third pair of legs furnished each with a long curved hair placed about the centre of the joint. The tarsi of all the legs provided with a long hair just above claw (or claws). Tarsi with apparently only one claw each. Antenn\u00e6 '06 mm. (Formula 5, 6, 3, (1, 2, 4,) 7), long, seven jointed, covered with fine hairs. 1st joint short: 2nd joint short, stout, about the same length as the first joint: 3rd joint thin, cylindrical, slightly longer than joint two: 4th joint shorter than joint three, about the same length as joint\ntwo: 5th joint extremely long, four times the length of joint four; 6th joint short, one and a half times length of joint four; 7th joint extremely thin and short, about one-fourth the length of joint six. It is extremely difficult to make out the different joints distinctly, but there is no doubt that joint 5 consists of only a single joint. Eyes maroon coloured. There are several rows of minute pores on the abdomen there being two rows on each abdominal segment. In the figure the artist has represented the vasiform orifice as seen ventrally by him through the transparent body.\n\nLarva 2nd stage. Size '7 mm. \u00d7 '37 mm.\n\nMargin slightly incurved on sides of cephalothorax and at caudal margin. Colour yellow, almost transparent when seen under the microscope. Yellow, pigment patch in centre of anterior abdominal segments. Eyes maroon coloured. Dorsum slightly elevated. The margin is unusually broad. The abdominal segments clearly discernible on elevated portion of dorsum. There is a narrow ridge running from thorax cephalid to the margin where it sometimes projects to a slight point. A series of closely apposed marginal wax tubes which secrete a very fragmentary fringe. Crenulations of marginal pores distinct right up to edge of elevated portion of dorsum. Edge of margin thickened somewhat, brown in colour. Marginal pores on incurved thoracic and caudal margins slightly larger than the rest. Two fairly long set\u00e6 on caudal margin, and a pair placed caudolaterally, slightly anterior to these and in line with the lower edge of the vasiform orifice. Vasiform orifice oval, anterior margin flattish. Edge of orifice tinged with brown. Operculum broader than long, of the same shape as the vasiform orifice. The anterior margin flat so that it only touches the rim of the vasiform orifice at the outer edges. Its lower edge extends some distance beyond centre of vasiform orifice. The free (lower) margin slightly elevated. Surface of operculum covered with fine hairs. Lingula short, cylindrical, difficult to make out as it is shorter than the operculum beneath which it lies.\n\nLarva 3rd stage. Size '85 mm. \u00d7 '5 mm.\n\nShape elliptical, narrower cephalad. Colour yellow: a bright yellow pigment spot on centre of anterior abdominal segments. Brown medio-dorsal ridge running from the thorax cephalad to margin. At thorax a dark brown bar crosses the median dorsal ridge at right angles. Posterior to this is another line which is angled caudolaterally, then back again cephalolaterally. Thorax suffused with light brown, with a deeply trilobed brown line on each side of mediiodorsal ridge demarcating the outlines of the developing insect within. Abdominal segments distinct. Edge of margin set with closely apposed pores.\nwhich produce a very fragmentary fringe. These pores are situated on a slightly higher plane than the margin. Margin incurved at sides of cephalothorax and at caudal margin. There are eight large and distinct wax tubes on each of these areas. Region around these indentures tinged with brown, which, in the case of the caudal indenture, reaches to the vasiform orifice. Eyes reddish. Two small set\u00e6 on the cephalic margin. Two small set\u00e6 caudad just within the margin and placed one on each side of the incurved area. They point upwards and outwards. Vasiform orifice similar to that in the larva 2nd stage. In some specimens the orifice is almost circular. In others the anterior margin and the sides are flattened somewhat, giving the vasiform orifice a conical appearance, the apex pointing caudad. The edges of the orifice tinged with brown. The orifice appears to project slightly beyond surface of the dorsum. The operculum similar in shape to that in the larva 2nd stage but is smaller in proportion and does not extend so far caudad. Lingula as in larva 2nd stage. There is but little difference except in size between this stage and the pupa, except that the insect is more transparent, has the median keel on cephalothorax less prominent and the operculum is larger, being intermediate in size between that of the pupa and the larva 2nd stage.\n\nPuparium. Size 1 mm. \u00d7 .78 mm.\n\nShape elliptical, narrower cephalad. Margin at thorax and caudal extremity incurved. Colour yellow. Dorsum elevated. A dark brown elevated median keel running from thorax to cephalic margin beyond which it slightly projects. At thorax a dark brown bar crosses the median dorsal ridge at right angles. Slightly posterior to this is another line which is angled caudolaterally and then back again cephalolaterally. Thorax suffused with brown; centre of abdomen suffused with lighter brown. Segments of abdomen fairly distinct along medio-dorsal line. Vasiform orifice oval: anterior margin slightly flattened. Rim round vasiform orifice dark brown. The lower portion of the orifice covered with fine short hairs. Operculum small, similar in outline to vasiform orifice. The lower edge extends to about the centre of the orifice. Surface covered with fine hairs. Lingula short, cylindrical, difficult to observe as it is shorter than the operculum and does not extend beyond that organ. Incurved areas at thoracic and caudal margins tinged with brown. At these places the marginal pores are eight in number, larger than the other marginal pores and differ in producing fairly long filaments of white wax. A distinct series of pores right around on margin. They secrete a quantity of gelatinous looking wax. Each individual filament is distinct for a certain distance beyond the margin then coalesces to form a gelatinous mass with the others. Dorsum cover-\ned with a similar gelatinous secretion. This is secreted from a large number of very minute pores which appear to lie all over the dorsum without any definite grouping. Colour of secretion yellow. Two set\u00e6, one on each side of incurved caudal area. Parasited pup\u00e6 are smaller than nonparasited pup\u00e6, are darker in colour and have the dorsum much arched. The developing parasite can be easily distinguished within the body.\n\nAdult female. Length 1 mm. Wing 1\u00b705 mm. \u00d7 0\u00b745 mm.\n\nColour yellow: thorax tinged with brown, body and legs dusted with white meal. Eyes reniform, almost divided. Upper half cherry-red lower half maroon. There is a large rectangular brown patch on last segment of abdomen: within it and at the upper end is the vasi-form orifice. Vasiform orifice oval. Operculum small; extending only to centre of orifice. Lingula long, cylindrical, extending a short distance beyond vasiform orifice. Forewing patched with bluish grey. These patches lie in the form of three bars which run across the wing being more or less interrupted at median vein. A longitudinal bar connects all the transverse patches. This bar is situated below the median vein but is prolonged above the vein to apical margin of wing. Apex of hindwing tinged with grey. Antenn\u00e6 yellow; Formula 3, 2, (5, 6, 7,) 1, 4. 1st joint short, stout: 2nd joint subpyriform, almost globular: 3rd joint thin, cylindrical, two-and-a-half times the length of joint two: 4th joint extremely short, half the length of joint two: joints 5, 6, and 7 one-and-a-half times the length of joint four. There is a dark line on each side of the under-surface of the second and third segments of the abdomen. The under-surface of the last segment of the abdomen with a patch of grey.\n\nAdult male. Size 0\u00b795 mm. Wing 0\u00b79 mm. \u00d7 0\u00b733 mm.\n\nColour yellow: dorsally segments of abdomen and thorax tinged with grey. Last segment of abdomen and genitalia uniform grey. Rest as in female.\n\nI first found this Aleurodid on the leaves of a seedling banyan (Ficus indica) lodged on the trunk of a mango tree in the vicinity of Calcutta. I was only able to obtain some half a dozen pup\u00e6 at the time. I was much struck by the gelatinous looking secretion of the insect. It is the only Aleurodid which I have obtained which produces such a secretion. It is possibly allied to A. gelatinosus, Ckll., although when the two insects are compared they appear to be very dissimilar. A. gelatinosus is elevated off the surface of the leaf by its lateral fringe, not so in this species. The margin of A. gelatinosus is deeply crenulated, while in this species the crenulations are quite difficult to detect. It differs in colour, A. gelatinosus being black: but the two\nspecies agree in producing an apparently similar substance, and the distinctive feature, the indentures on the cephalo-lateral and caudal margins with the pencils of wax issuing therefrom, are common to both. I have, within the last two years, frequently come across this species; at first only on banyan (Ficus indica) seedlings, where I searched for it; but later on also on pepul (Ficus religiosa) seedlings as well. I find that especially after the rainy season (about October) the insect simply swarms on the young banyan and pepul plants, which spring up during the rains on buildings, rubbish heaps and the like. In the case of the pepul seedlings it is frequently associated with A. quaintancei. One peculiarity, however, is that I have only found this species on young plants, and when the two species are both present on the same plant this aleurodid is always to be found on the lower and older leaves. I have failed so far to find the insect on banyan or pepul trees, though I have frequently searched for it. So far, I have only obtained this species from two localities; at Turkaulia, Champaran district, Behar, and in and around Calcutta. The insect is heavily parasited by a minute yellow chalcid. When parasited the dorsum becomes very convex and when the parasite pupates it can be seen quite easily within the body. Although it is to be often found associated with A. quaintancei the chalcid parasiting A. quaintancei never to my knowledge attacks this species. It is a pity that the insect should suffer so severely from this parasite, as it undoubtedly does some indirect good by killing off the enormous numbers of pepul and banyan plants which take root on old buildings and the like, and which would otherwise in many cases grow up and do future injury. The aleurodid is usually present in large numbers, several hundred being frequently attached to a single leaf, in the greater number of cases eventually killing off the plant. Most of my material has been obtained from the Museum terrace. I may note that I have failed so far to obtain specimens of the 2nd stage; the stages marked 2nd and 3rd being probably the 3rd and 4th. I have much pleasure in naming this species after Major A. Alcock, F.R.S., C.I.E., Superintendent, Indian Museum, to whom I am much indebted for encouragement in my entomological studies.\n\n4. Aleurodes quaintancei n. sp. Plate V, Figs. 10-14.\n\nEgg. Size '18 mm. x '09 mm.\n\nCream coloured when recently laid, changing later to light brown. Peduncle about one-third length of egg. The eggs are usually laid four or five abreast in a curved line.\n\nI take this opportunity of naming this species after Mr. A. L. Quaintance, to whom I am indebted for much valuable assistance in my study of this family.\nLarva 1st stage. Size '28 mm. \u00d7 '9 mm.\n\nShape elliptical, narrow for its length. Colour light yellow. Dorsum flat: segments of abdomen fairly distinct. Four long set\u00e6 caudad on margin. They rise from small tubercles. Between each pair is a short seta. Four pairs of short set\u00e6 (four a side) placed caudo-laterally on margin and forming a continuation of the caudal set\u00e6. Laterally on margin six pairs of short set\u00e6 (six a side) the pair furthest cephalad longest. Six long set\u00e6 cephalad on margin (three a side), of these the second pair is longest. The caudo-lateral, lateral and cephalic set\u00e6 do not form a continuous line, there being a space between each set of set\u00e6. Legs and antenn\u00e6 present. Vasiform orifice as in the pupa only larger in proportion, and the operculum only extends to about the centre of the vasiform orifice.\n\nLarva 2nd stage. Size '42 mm. \u00d7 '3 mm.\n\nShape elliptical, broader in proportion than the first stage. Dorsum flat: abdominal segments fairly distinct. Eyes maroon. Two short set\u00e6 on cephalic margin, two fairly long set\u00e6 caudad on margin and two short set\u00e6 caudo-laterally on margin. The set\u00e6 caudad on margin spring from small tubercles. Vasiform orifice as in pupa but larger in proportion.\n\nLarva 3rd stage. Size '7 mm. \u00d7 '53 mm.\n\nShape elliptical, broad for its length. Colour light yellow. Dorsum flat, sometimes slightly rounded. Thoracic and abdominal segments clearly discernible. With the exception of the central area, the surface of the dorsum is covered with coarse granular striations which extend to the margin. Vasiform orifice essentially the same as in later stages. Set\u00e6 as in previous stage. In some cases there is a slight line running from thorax cephalad to margin and faint indications of the two radial yellow bands running from thorax to cephalo-lateral margins. The channelled passage running from the posterior extremity of the vasiform orifice caudad to margin and the two ridges situated one on each side of the vasiform orifice and the channelled passage which are present in the pupa, first appear in this stage.\n\nLarva 4th stage. Size 1'05 mm. \u00d7 '76 mm.\n\nCharacters essentially as in pupa.\n\nPuparium. Size 1'55 mm. \u00d7 1'23 mm.\n\nShape oval. Colour translucent white, with in most cases a tinge of yellow, two yellow pigment spots usually present on the first two segments of the abdomen. As the insect develops within the entire thorax and abdomen become yellow and opaque. Dorsum slightly convex, the surface, with the exception of the central area, covered with granular striations which radiate to the margin. Abdomen and abdom-\ninal segments clearly defined. Sides and divisions of thorax apparent, the sides being bounded by a three-lobed line. Three faint lines running from suture between pro and mesothorax, one cephalad and two cephalo-laterally to margin. The cephalo-lateral lines are really more or less clearly defined yellow bands. In some specimens a fairly broad distinct margin can be observed, but in others the margin gradually merges into the central dorsal area, there being no well defined inner edge. In some the margin is extremely pronounced but this is apparently only the case when the insect is parasitized. As in the larvae of the three preceding stages there are two small setae cephalad on margin and four (the two inner long and placed on tubercles) on the caudal margin. Vasiform orifice conical, apex pointing caudad; corners rounded. Anterior margin flat. Edge of orifice tinged with brown. Caudad there is a channelled passage extending to margin. Operculum broader than long, nearly filling aperture of vasiform orifice. Anterior margin flat, posterior margin concave, lateral margins convex and angled inwards to posterior margin. Corners rounded. Colour brown, posterior edge darkest. Lingula long, cylindrical, spatulate at tip. It projects about one-third its length beyond the operculum. Colour brown. There are two rounded yellow ridges which lie one on each side of the vasiform orifice. They are prolonged caudad to margin. The channelled passage is situated between them. The two long caudal setae are situated on the end of these ridges. Small tufts of brown wax are secreted at margin at end of these ridges and also where the cephalo-lateral bands touch the margin. There is an extremely light and narrow marginal fringe of wax. Normally the pupa is semitransparent, flat, and its lower surface adheres closely to the surface of the leaf. The longitudinal cephalic, and radial cephalo-lateral lines are then fairly distinct. As the pupa matures the dorsum becomes convex, the central area becomes yellow and the margin turns an opaque white. The cephalic and cephalo-lateral radial lines are then very distinct. Parasitized pupae however have an entirely different appearance. The insect is then more or less opaque, the colour ranging from a uniform yellow through shades of brown and red brown to black. Usually however the parasitized pupa has two dark brown blotches one on the thoracic and one on the abdominal region, the rest of the dorsum being of a yellow or cream colour. When the parasite pupates it shows up as a brown and black patch within the central area of the dorsum. The dorsum of a parasitized pupa is invariably highly convex, almost globular in fact. Pupae from which the parasite has emerged are of a dark yellow or brown colour, while those which develop normally and from which the insects have emerged in due course are of a dull semitrans-\nparent white colour. The chalcid parasitising this insect has its head and thorax black, abdomen brown.\n\nAdult female. Size 1\u00b71 mm.

Legs semitransparent, tinged with grey, joints yellow. Eyes reniform, maroon. Wings white with three faint bands of grey running diagonally across wing. Nervure dark grey where the bands cross it. Hind wing immaculate. Body and legs powdered with white meal. Antenn\u00e6 0\u00b732 mm. in length. Formula 3, 2, 7, (4, 5, 6) 1. The first joint is short and flat; the second joint stout, pyriform, about three times the length of joint one; the third joint long, thin, cylindrical, about two-and-a-half times the length of joint two; the fourth, fifth, and sixth joints equal, the three together about equalling joint three in length; the seventh joint thin, slightly longer than joint six.\n\nVasiform orifice oval, anterior edge flattened. Operculum similar in shape but slightly smaller being only about two-thirds the size of the vasiform orifice. The posterior edge is concave. Lingula long, cylindrical, projecting about one-third of its length beyond operculum.\n\nAdult male. Length 0\u00b795 mm. Wing 1\u00b705 mm. \u00d7 0\u00b748 mm. Antenn\u00e6 0\u00b725 mm.\n\nMarkings of wing similar to that in female. Entire body yellow, legs as in female. Two small tubercles on last segment of abdomen just above forcipate process. I have found this species on pepul (Ficus religiosa) in and around Calcutta. It is extremely abundant after the rains (October-November).\n\n5. *Aleurodes simula* n. sp. Plate III, Figs. 1\u201314.\n\nEgg. Size 0\u00b72 mm. \u00d7 0\u00b709 mm.\n\nColour light yellow when first laid, afterwards turning brown. Peduncle about one-fourth length of egg. Examined while still within the body of the female the eggs are light yellow. The peduncle is curved inwards and pressed against the egg. Colour of peduncle pink, basal end of egg fairly dark yellow.\n\nLarva 1st stage. Size 0\u00b725 mm. \u00d7 0\u00b715 mm.\n\nShape elliptical. Colour semitransparent yellow; two yellow pigment patches in centre of abdominal region. There are a series of 34 long hairs right around margin. The four hairs furthest cephalad are grouped in two pairs placed some distance apart. Of the six hairs on caudal margin the inner pair long, the second pair short, and the third pair long. The 24 other set\u00e6 are shorter than the long caudal set\u00e6, they are situated at equal distances apart on the lateral margins. Vasiform orifice as in the pupa-case, but the operculum is larger proportion-\nately, and the lateral margins of the orifice are somewhat incurved posteriorly beyond the operculum. Eyes maroon. Abdominal segments distinct. Antenn\u00e6 and legs present. The artist has drawn the vasi-form orifice as seen by him through the transparent body.\n\nLarva 2nd stage. Size '45 mm. \u00d7 '32 mm.\n\nShape elliptical; colour yellow. Two yellow pigment patches in centre of abdominal region. Two curved hairs caudad on margin. Vasiform orifice as in the pupa-case, but the orifice is situated quite close to the margin. Abdominal segments distinct. Eyes maroon. A marginal fringe of stout, cylindrical, waxy filaments which are placed quite close together.\n\nLarva 3rd stage. Size '7 mm. \u00d7 '5 mm.\n\nShape elliptical, margin at thorax angled slightly outwards. Dorsum almost flat. Colour yellow. Two set\u00e6 caudad, and two set\u00e6 placed caudolaterally on margin. A marginal fringe of stout, cylindrical wax filaments. Eyes maroon. Abdominal segments distinct. Dorsum granular near margin. Margin broad, faintly demarcated mesad, and deeply striated radially. There is a distinct yellow band extending from the posterior extremity of the vasiform orifice caudad to margin. There are faint indications of the two radial thoracic bands so conspicuous in the pupa. They end, as also does the band extending caudad to margin, in five separate brown horizontal pores which secrete a small quantity of brown wax. Dorsum covered with a large number of extremely minute circular pores.\n\nLarva 4th stage. Size 1\u00b725 mm. \u00d7 1 mm.\n\nSimilar to pupa-case except in size, it is also flatter.\n\nPuparium. Size. 1\u00b786 mm. \u00d7 1\u00b752 mm.\n\nShape oval, anteriorly the thoracic margins angled outwards, giving the anterior end a somewhat square appearance. Colour bright yellow. Dorsum at first somewhat flat, later turning fairly convex. Three ridges on dorsum, two radiating from thorax to cephalo-thoracic margins, and one from the posterior end of the vasiform orifice caudad to margin. These ridges are dark yellow, blotched with grey. They end marginally in five stout distinct brown pores which produce a small quantity of brown fluffy wax. Margin broad, demarcated mesad by a fairly broad distinct white band the inner edge of which is dark brown. Margin with strongly marked radial striations, the dorsum also marked around the central area, but the markings are more granular than striated. A small quantity of short stout waxy filaments produced from marginal pores spaced some distance apart. There are also a series of submarginal pores which produce finer and longer wax filaments. They are also spaced some distance apart. There are two small slender set\u00e6 on cephalic, and two\nsimilar but smaller set\u00e6 on lateral margins. Surface of dorsum and especially of the margin covered with a very great number of extremely minute circular pores which tend to form detached groups. These pores are also present over the radial patches, but the grouping does not differ from the rest of the margin, the pores not being arranged in any sort of pattern.\n\nThe margin of the pupa-case turns quite white a short time before the adult emerges. Vasiform orifice conical, apex pointing caudad. Anterior margin flat. Lateral margins sloping inwards; the sloping surface with six ridges on each side. Operculum rhomboidal; the posterior margin somewhat incurved. The operculum extends to about or a little beyond the centre of the vasiform orifice. Surface setose, colour light brown. Lingula two-jointed, lower joint short, stout. Upper joint club-shaped. The lingula extends for one-third its length beyond operculum; the surface setose, colour brown. Two long hairs spring from near the tip of the lingula and extend some distance beyond the vasiform orifice.\n\nPupa extracted from puparium.\n\nHead fairly broad, colour yellow, the ocelli lighter in colour. Thorax rather dark yellow, abdomen light yellow. Eyes dark maroon. Unfolded wings dark grey. Legs almost transparent, well formed, setose. Sides of abdomen flattened and spread out. Abdominal segments fairly distinct but the vasiform orifice cannot be made out. Antenn\u00e6 not noticeable in the specimen examined. When the adult emerges from the pupa-case the dorsum splits up not only from the cephalic margin to thorax, and across the thorax, but also right round the inner edge of the margin so that in empty pupal cases the anterior portion of the dorsum is usually missing. I have observed no parasites on this species.\n\nAdult female. Length 1\u00b79 mm. Wing. Size 1\u00b79 mm. \u00d7 \u201885 mm.\n\nBody light yellow; antenn\u00e6 and legs semi-transparent white. Tip of mentum grey. A lateral grey stripe on each side of the first segment of the abdomen, and dorsally a rather broad diagonal grey patch on each side of the same segment. Dorsally each abdominal segment dark grey nearly the entire width of the body. An oval grey plate situated on the dorsal surface of the last segment of the abdomen. It encloses the vasiform orifice. Ventrally the abdomen covered with fine short hairs. Body and legs covered with white meal. Eyes reniform almost divided; colour dark maroon. Wings immaculate. Vasiform orifice broadly conical, the anterior edge somewhat produced and with a flat indenture in the centre. Operculum cordate, apex pointing cephalad. Posterior margin incurved; lateral margins dark and wavy. The operculum extends nearly the whole length of the orifice, but is somewhat narrower. Colour dark\ngrey. Lingula cylindrical; it projects to the posterior edge of the vasi-\nform orifice. End almost flat. Only the part which projects beyond the\noperculum can be made out. Colour grey. Antenn\u00e6 length '5 mm.\nFormula (3, 6,) (2, 4, 5,) 7, 1. Joint one short, flat; joint two subpyriform,\nabout twice length of joint one; joints three and six equal in length, each\nabout twice the length of joint two; joints four and five each equal in\nlength to joint two; joint seven short, thin, and tapering to a point, about\none-third length of joint six.\n\nAdult male. Length 1\u00b77 mm. Wing. 1\u00b75 mm. \u00d7 '77 mm.\n\nColour, etc., much as in the female. The antenn\u00e6 however are\nenormously developed, being proportionately about twice as long as those\nin the female. Length '9 mm. Formula 5, 3, (6, 7,) 2, 4, 1. Joint five is\nvery long, being nearly equal to all the others together. Joint one short\nflat; joint two subpyriform, twice length of joint one; joint three fairly\nlong, one-and-a-half times length of joint two; joint four short, less than\nhalf the length of joint three; joint five long almost equal to all the other\njoints together; joints six and seven equal, together about equal to\njoints three and four. The antenn\u00e6 are heavily ringed and it is extreme-\nly difficult to make out the joints. The under surface of the abdomen\ncovered with a large quantity of white fluff.\n\nThis species occurs in great abundance on the Simul tree (Bombyx\nmalabaricum) in Calcutta. The leaves are thickly covered with the\ninsect; they become yellow and spotted wherever an insect is attached\nand are ultimately killed. Superficially the insect somewhat resembles\nA. eugeni\u00e6, Mask. There are the same radiating dorsal patches and the\ndorsum is similarly striated. They differ however in the shape of the\npupa-case, and the shape of the vasi-form orifice. A. simula has a slight\nmarginal fringe and there are four set\u00e6 on the margin. The radiating\ndorsal patches are quite different in the two insects. In A. simula\nthese patches are not formed by closely apposed pores but are yellow\nbands striated with grey. The thoracic radial patches are also true\nridges, being elevated above the surface of the dorsum. All three pat-\nches in this species end not in a single aperture or pore opening dorsally,\nbut in five stout brown horizontal pores which secrete a small quantity of\nfluffy brown wax. The dorsum in this species is covered with a large\nnumber of extremely minute circular pores; the margin is also broad\nand clearly defined.\n\nMr. Maskell was mistaken in assuming that the three radial patches\nwere sufficient evidence to prove the close relationship of A. eugeni\u00e6 and\nA. eugeni\u00e6 var. aurantii. As a matter of fact many of the Indian Aleu-\nrodidae possess this characteristic, however widely different they may\notherwise be.\nAleurodes bambusae n. sp. Plate IV, Figs. 1\u20139.\n\nEgg. Length '25 mm. \u00d7 '11 mm.\nColour light brown. Surface sculptured with hexagons. Attached in an upright position to leaf by a short peduncle.\n\nLarva 1st stage. Size '35 mm. \u00d7 '2 mm.\nShape elliptical; narrow for its length. Colour deep black; dark brown under the microscope. The dorsum is completely hidden by a quantity of white fluff which is produced by a series of submarginal pores. There is an elevated mesio-dorsal ridge extending anteriorly almost to the margin and posteriorly to the vasiform orifice. Segments of abdomen fairly distinct. Margin crenulated, bearing a series of closely apposed pores which produce a regular but somewhat short horizontal fringe. Ventrally just within the margin a series of pores which produce a scanty white secretion. There are four long set\u00e6 on cephalic and four on caudal margins. On the dorsum there are four long stout curved spines which are situated a pair on the cephalic and a pair on the anterior edge of the abdominal region. They are placed on the sides of the medio dorsal ridge. The spines point backwards. Each spine is about half the length of the body, the anterior pair being slightly longer. Two short stout curved spines are situated one on each side of the vasiform orifice. Vasiform orifice large elevated on a tubercle. It is apparently similar to that in the puparium but owing to the colour is difficult to make out.\n\nLarva 2nd stage. Size '55 mm. \u00d7 '3 mm.\nSimilar except in size to larva 3rd stage.\n\nLarva 3rd stage. Size 1 mm. \u00d7 '55 mm.\nShape elliptical, somewhat broader proportionately than in the first stage. Colour dense black. There is a distinct mesio dorsal ridge which is somewhat slighter than in the preceding stage. Abdominal segments distinct. Area surrounding vasiform orifice darker than the rest of the abdomen. Margin broad crenulated. Mesad the margin ends at a broad ridge which separates it from the rest of the dorsum. Along its edge are a series of large closely apposed pores which produce a short but abundant horizontal fringe of wax. The upper surface of the margin bears a large number of extremely minute pores. These pores produce a quantity of white fluffy wax filaments which curve inwards and cover the dorsum. Ventrally a little within the margin there are a series of pores which produce a small quantity of wax. The dorsum is covered with a number of stout spines. There are: a pair on the cephalic region at end of mesio dorsal ridge and nearly on the margin; two pairs placed fairly close together on the cephalic region; a pair placed widely apart on the thoracic region; immediately behind this pair there\nare two pairs placed fairly close together on the lower edge of the mesio dorsal ridge; a pair of spines on each of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th abdominal segments; and two stout curved spines, one on each side of the vasiform orifice. There are two short setae, one on each side of the vasiform orifice and two fairly long setae caudad on margin. The vasiform orifice as in preceding stages, but in some specimens the lingula appears large and dumb-bell shaped.\n\nLarva 4th stage. Size 1\u00b74 mm. \u00d7 9 mm.\n\nShape elliptical, anterior edge abruptly conical. Colour dense black. Mesio dorsal ridge as in preceding stages. A broad crenulated margin which ends mesad in an elevated ridge which separates it from the rest of the dorsum. The margin ends in a series of large closely apposed pores which produce a short thick marginal fringe of white wax. The upper surface of the margin is covered with a large number of minute pores which produce a quantity of white fluff, which curving inwards covers the dorsum. Segments of abdomen distinct. The dorsum is covered with a large number of stout spines which lie: five pairs on the cephalic region; four pairs on the thoracic region, and five pairs on the abdominal segments. There is also a stout curved pair situated one on each side of the vasiform orifice. There are two short setae, one on each side of the vasiform orifice and a slightly longer pair caudad on margin. Vasiform orifice large in proportion to its size as compared to the vasiform orifice in the puparium.\n\nPuparium. Size 2\u00b71 mm. \u00d7 1\u00b74 mm.\n\nShape elliptical, broadest caudad. Colour dense black. Distinct mesio dorsal ridge which is narrow and sharp anteriorly, and broad and rounded posteriorly. From this ridge there are a series of five ridges which mark out the abdominal segments. Margin broad, crenulated; bearing on its upper surface a large number of minute pores which produce a quantity of white wax filaments which curling inwards conceal the dorsum. There are a series of closely apposed marginal pores which produce a short but abundant horizontal secretion of wax. There are ventrally on margin a series of pores which produce a small quantity of wax. The dorsum is covered with a large number of short but stout spines. These spines are grouped as follows. There are thirty hooked spines forming a ring around the dorsum just within the margin. The other spines are shorter and are situated as follows. A double row of eight spines across the cephalic region; four spines on the thoracic region; sixteen spines in a row down the mesio dorsal ridge on the abdominal region; two rows of three spines, one row on each side of the mesio dorsal ridge on 1st and 2nd abdominal segments; two rows of two spines placed similarly on third and fourth segments and one spine on each\nside of the mesio dorsal ridge on the 5th segment. A pair of short stout spines placed, one on each side of the vasiform orifice. Two long set\u00e6 caudad and two cephalad on margin. The vasiform orifice is situated on a short tubercle at the posterior end of the mesio dorsal ridge. Shape oval. Operculum similar in shape but somewhat smaller, the lower half apparently slightly ridged. Lingula indistinct, shape rectangular, broader than long. It is completely covered by the operculum.\n\nAdult form unknown.\n\nThis Aleurodid occurs plentifully on various species of bamboo in the vicinity of Calcutta. As a rule only a few leaves in a bamboo clump are attacked by the insect. I have, however, sometimes found it occurring in very large numbers in some bamboo clumps. It then undoubtedly is a rather serious pest as frequently most of the leaves are then killed. The insect is kept in check by a parasite, presumably a chalcid, as large numbers of dead insects can always be found which have the minute hole on the dorsum made by the parasite for its exit. I have so far obtained no specimens of the parasite. When this aleurodid is detached from the leaf it will be observed that the portion of the leaf beneath the insect is yellow and discoloured. As a rule the exuviae of the preceding stages remains attached to the spines on the dorsum.\n\n*Aleurodes leakii* n. sp. Plate V, Figs. 4-5.\n\nI obtained specimens of this insect off both Natal (*I. arrecta*) and ordinary indigo (*Indigofera tinctoria*) at Dalsing Serai, Behar, in the month of May 1902. As seen with the naked eye the pup\u00e6 and larv\u00e6 are yellowish in colour. I noticed one peculiarity with regard to this species; the scales invariably occur on the upper surface of the leaves. This is rather an unusual feature. The insect itself was not common enough to constitute a pest. It may possibly however at other times of the year be present in larger numbers and so prove a factor amongst the numerous insect pests indigo has to contend with. I have found it to be far commoner on Natal than on ordinary indigo. Considering that in the future the Natal plant will almost certainly be grown to a large extent owing to its superiority over the ordinary indigo the suppression of this pest may at some time have to be taken in hand. The scales themselves as a rule occur rather sparsely, two or three on each leaflet. I have however occasionally found them in fairly large numbers on single leaflets.\n\nEgg. Size '2 mm. \u00d7 '1 mm.\n\nColour yellowish brown. The egg is attached to the leaf in an upright position by a short peduncle or stalk.\n\nLarva probably 2nd stage. Size 1\u00b705 mm. \u00d7 '76 mm.\n\nShape elliptical; colour whitish-yellow, a few yellowish-brown\nmarks along the centre of dorsum: dorsum covered with coarse granulations. Segments of body more or less distinct along dorsum. Margin of case broad, crenulated; there is no wax fringe. Dorsum flattish, sometimes slightly convex. Vasiform orifice conical, very much elongated, anterior edge concave, sides emarginate. Abdomen distinctly cleft from the vasiform orifice to the posterior margin, the edge of which is slightly incurved to meet the cleft; the vasiform orifice is over one-half the length of the cleft. Operculum attached anteriorly to vasiform orifice, sub-elliptical, broader than long, Lingula narrow, broadest at tip, narrowest a little above the middle. Tip conical, projecting beyond operculum about one-and-a-half times the length of the operculum. It is slightly shorter than the vasiform orifice within which it lies.\n\nLarva. Last stage. Size 1\u00b71 mm. \u00d7 \u00b776 mm.\n\nShape elliptical. Dorsum almost transparent. Segments more or less distinct along dorsum. Insect itself more or less distinct beneath the dorsum. Colour of maturing insect orange to yellow, eyes maroon. Margin of dorsum broad and transparent, the rest of the body faint greenish-yellow. Vasiform orifice lemon-yellow the operculum slightly darker in shade. Lingula similar in colour. Vasiform orifice operculum and lingula as in preceding stage. No trace of set\u00e6 or hairs, either on dorsum or on margin of body. Margin extremely flat, the dorsum rises with a slight curve from margin.\n\nPuparium. Size 1\u00b715 mm. \u00d7 \u00b784 mm.\n\nColour translucent, faintly tinged with yellow. Insect itself clearly discernable beneath the dorsum; colour yellow, eyes dark red. The rest as in larval stages.\n\nAdult female. Length \u00b785 mm. Wing 1\u00b705 mm. \u00d7 \u00b735 mm.\n\nColour of body brownish-yellow; legs and antenn\u00e6 yellow. Length of antenn\u00e6 \u00b722 mm., seven jointed: joint one short, subpyriform: joint two stout, slightly longer than joint one: joint three two and a half times length of joint two: joint four short, less than one-third joint three in length: joints five and six equal, slightly shorter than joint two: joint seven long and tapering, half the length of joint three. Wings immaculate. Eyes reniform, undivided.\n\nI have been unable to obtain specimens of the adult male.\n\nI have much pleasure in naming this species after Mr. H. M. Leake, who assisted me in collecting specimens and was kind enough to mount examples for the microscope.\n\nAleurodes hoy\u00e6 n. sp. Plate V, Figs. 1\u20133.\n\nThis species is fairly common in and around Calcutta on Hoya sp. I have observed it in the years 1900, 1901, and 1902. Although it is\ncomparatively easy to obtain larv\u00e6 and pup\u00e6 I had the greatest difficulty in rearing adults as nearly every one of the many hundred pup\u00e6 I have examined was parasited; the parasite, a minute hymenopteron (a chalcid) cutting a neat circular hole on the dorsal surface of the puparium when escaping. This species is I believe unique in having the wings of the adult of a uniform plum-blue colour. Owing to this peculiarity it has a remarkably moth-like appearance.\n\nEgg. Size 25 mm. \u00d7 1 mm.\n\nLight brown, curved, surface sculptured with lines forming irregular hexagons. Peduncle one-sixth length of egg.\n\nLarva first stage. Size 9 mm. \u00d7 68 mm.\n\nShape elongate elliptical. Colour light yellowish-brown. At this stage the larva is somewhat dissimilar in appearance to more advanced larvae, the larva being in some cases comparatively narrow and long. Dorsum flat and minutely granulated. There is a slight dorsal ridge.\n\nLarva 2nd stage. Size 1\u00b74 mm. \u00d7 1\u00b72 mm.\n\nShape elliptical. Colour light-brown. Dorsum flat and granular. There is a delicate series of marginal wax tubes from which a small quantity of wax filaments extrude; filaments short. Vasiform orifice similar in shape to that in the third stage. Operculum darker in colour than the rest of the body. Caudal margin slightly incurved, with two wax tubes which are larger than those on the margin, situated one on each side of the curve. They produce two fairly long wax filaments.\n\nLarva 3rd stage. Size 1\u00b76 mm. \u00d7 1\u00b74 mm.\n\nColour from light to dark-brown; centre of dorsum darkest, there being a wide band lighter than the centre along edge of dorsum. Shape elliptical, flattish. Broad medio dorsal ridge on which the abdominal and thoracic segments are clearly discernible. Dorsum granular in appearance. The centre of dorsum has small circular granulations, those on the outer edge being coarser and oval in shape. A series of minute closely apposed wax tubes along margin. There are sometimes traces of a waxy fringe. Vasiform orifice cordate; anterior margin flattish or slightly incurved. Operculum similar in shape and extending almost to the caudal extremity of the vasiform orifice. Edge of vasiform orifice tinged with brown as also the operculum.\n\nPuparium. Size 1\u00b762 mm. \u00d7 1\u00b743 mm.\n\nColour black. Shape elliptical. Some specimens, however, are almost circular. The dorsum is granular and rounded. The medio-dorsal ridge so conspicuous in the larva is far less prominent though still discernible. Margin flat and extremely narrow. Vasiform orifice cordate, anterior margin flattish. Owing to the extremely dense black colour of the dorsum it is difficult to make out the details of the vasiform orifice\neven after boiling in caustic potash. It however appears to be similar to that in the larva.\n\nAdult female. Size 1\u00b785 mm. Wing 1\u00b755 mm. \u00d7 0\u00b767 mm.\n\nBody brown. Legs and antenn\u00e6 yellowish-brown.

Joint one short subpyriform; joint two stout, one and a half times the length of joint one; joint three long, cylindrical, about twice the length of joint two; joint four short, slightly shorter than joint two; joints five, six, seven equal, each about half the length of joint three. Vasiform orifice obovate, operculum small; anterior and posterior margins flat, lateral margins curving outwards from anterior margin and incurving to meet posterior margin. Lingula V shaped, upper extremity broadest, narrowing in centre and broadening out slightly at tip. The tip itself is conical. It projects slightly beyond vasiform orifice; wing purplish-blue in colour, having a bloom on it like that seen on a plum. Edges of the wing reddish along margin. A series of closely apposed globular projections each bearing two delicate set\u00e6.\n\nI only succeeded in rearing three adult females. I have never obtained the male.\n\nChapter VI.\n\nDescription of Aleurodidae previously described from the Indian Region.\n\nOnly a few species of this family have been described so far from India and Ceylon. For the sake of convenience I have thought it advisable to include the full descriptions.\n\nThe following species have so far been described.\n\nAleurodes eugeni\u00e6 Mask.\nAleurodes eugeni\u00e6 Mask. var. aurantii Mask.\nAleurodes barodensis Mask.\nAleurodes cotesii Mask.\nAleurodes piperis Mask.\nAleurodes nubilans Buckton.\n\nThree other species in all have been described from the Oriental Region. A. gossypii Fitch, A. lactea Zehnt. and A. longicornis Zehnt. Their descriptions will be given in Part II.\n\nAleurodes eugeni\u00e6 Mask.\n\nTrans., N.Z. Inst., Vol. XXVIII, 1895, p. 430, Indian Museum Notes, Vol. IV, No. 2, p. 52.\n\nLarva dull white or grey, or slightly yellowish; form roundly elliptical, the anterior edge very slightly compressed; dorsum scarcely convex; length about \u00bc inch. Dorsum marked with very delicate radiating stri\u00e6. Margin without either fringe or hairs, and not at all thick-\nened, but finely fluted and minutely crenulated. Three marginal de-\npressions and radiating dorsal patches as described below in the pupa.\n\nPupa-case very pale yellow, or greyish; dorsum very slightly con-\nvex; form roundly elliptical or subcircular; length about one-twentieth\nin. as a rule, but reaching one-fifteenth in. The enclosed pupa is con-\nspicuous dorsally, dark brown, the segments fairly distinct; on turning\nover the case the rudimentary feet may be made out rather confusedly,\nand the antenn\u00e6 more faintly. Dorsum of the case marked with radiat-\ning stri\u00e6, more clear than those of the larva: these stri\u00e6 are most con-\nspicuous near the margin, which is not at all thickened, but marked with\nnarrow but deep channels dividing it into broad segments. At three\npoints in the margin there are small concave depressions, one on each side\nopposite the rostrum, and one at the abdominal extremity. Correspon-\nding with these, on the dorsum, are three very faint radiating dotted\npatches: when viewed by transmitted light, these patches are seen to be\nformed of a lace-like pattern, with small, irregular cells, and at their\nextremity they end in a circular orifice deeply crenulated; the anterior\npair extend from the rostrum to the margin, the posterior one from the\nvasiform orifice to the margin. Vasiform orifice with straight anterior\nedge, sides and end regularly convex; operculum nearly covering the\norifice, and of similar form; lingula short, almost regularly cylindrical,\nscarcely extending beyond the operculum. There is no marginal fringe,\nnor are there any dorsal or marginal hairs.\n\nAdult form unknown.\n\nHab. In India, on Eugenia jambolana. My specimens were sent\nby Dr. Alcock, Superintendent of the Indian Museum, Calcutta. From\nthe great numbers on the leaves it would seem that the insect is injuri-\nous. They came from Poona.\n\nA short description of this insect was sent by me to Dr. Alcock for\ninsertion in \"Indian Museum Notes;\" but I have included it again here\nin order to note the distinctions which separate it, firstly, from A. euge-\nni\u00e6, var. aurantii, next described, and secondly, from A. citri (Ashmead),\nRiley and Howard, Insect Life, 1893, p. 219. As to the first my descrip-\ntions and figures will suffice. From A. citri the species differs in the\nentire absence of marginal and dorsal hairs in the larva and in the three\nradiating lace-work patches, of which no mention is made by Riley and\nHoward, but which are conspicuous characters of A. eugeni\u00e6.\n\nThis insect and its variety, with A. citri, A. melicyti, and others, may\nbe placed in a series of which A. proletella, Linn., may be taken as the\ntype.\n\nAleurodes eugeni\u00e6, Maskell, var. Aurantii, Maskell.\nTrans., N.Z. Inst., Vol. XXVIII, 1895, p. 431, Ind. Mus. Notes,\nLarva very pale-yellow, sometimes almost white; form roundly elliptical, flattish; length about one-fortieth in. Dorsum striated, but the striations are very faint, except near the margin. Margin not at all thickened, finely fluted and crenulated, bearing no hairs or fringe. There are three small marginal depressions and three dorsal patches as in the pupa.\n\nPupa-case very pale yellow, roundly elliptical or subcircular, flat-tish and thin; length about one-twenty-fourth in., reaching sometimes as much as one-sixteenth in. The enclosed pupa is only faintly discernible dorsally, rather darker than the case, the abdominal segments moderately distinct; on turning over the case the rudimentary organs are less confused than in *A. eugeni\u00e6*. Dorsum of the case very finely marked with radiating striae, which are a little more conspicuous near the margin. Margin not thickened, almost entire, divided by deep narrow channels into segments narrower than those of *A. eugeni\u00e6*. There are three marginal depressions, two opposite the rostrum and one at the abdominal extremity, and three radiating patches terminating at these depressions; the patches end (as in the type) in crenulated circular orifices, but are composed of great numbers of very minute circular pores or dots, which do not form a lace-work pattern. Vasiform orifice subtrapezoidal or subelliptical, broader than long; operculum nearly fitting the orifice; lingula very short, cylindrical with a dilated end, sometimes obsolete.\n\nAdult form unknown.\n\n*Hab.* In India, on *Citrus aurantium*. Mr. Cotes, late of the Indian Museum, Calcutta, sent me some orange leaves from \"North-West Himalayas,\" thickly covered with this insect.\n\nI attach this as a variety to *A. eugeni\u00e6* on account of the similarity in several respects, notably in the dorsal radiating patches, though it differs in some others. It has none of the marginal or dorsal characters of *A. citri*, Riley and Howard.\n\n*Aleurodes barodensis*, Maskell.\n\nTrans., N.Z. Inst., Vol. XXVIII, 1895, p. 424, Ind. Mus.

The eggs and empty shells are found in large numbers on the leaf.\n\nLarva dark-brown, becoming later almost black; elongated elliptical; slightly convex; abdominal segments fairly distinct, length about one-forty-fifth in. Margin minutely crenulated and bearing a short white waxy fringe, which is frequently very fragmentary or absent. Dorsum bearing, within the margin, a row of about thirty-two small simple circular pores; within these is a transverse row of four on the\nanterior thoracic region, another transverse row of four on the anterior abdominal region, a longitudinal row of four on each side of the abdomen, and one on each side of the vasiform orifice. Vasiform orifice subconical, the posterior extremity slightly produced; operculum short, rounded, subconical; lingula cylindrical at the base, afterwards widened, finally tapering, not quite reaching the edge of the orifice.\n\nPupa-case very dark-brown or glossy-black; very elongated, elliptical, with sides nearly straight, the width only about one-third of the length. Dorsum sometimes slightly convex, sometimes flat, sometimes slightly concave; abdominal segments indistinct. Vasiform orifice apparently as in the larva, but difficult to make out on account of the very dark colour of the case. Margin crenulated and bearing a very elegant, long, snowy-white fringe of slender waxy cylindrical tubes. There is frequently some white powdery meal on the dorsum, which probably bears pores as in the larva, but it is most difficult to detect them. The ventral surface is flat, brown; the rudimentary organs are not distinct, owing to the dark colour.\n\nAdult form unknown.\n\nHab. In India, on Saccharum officinale.

In the earliest state only very faint indications of the insect itself appear, and the whole is very thin and flat; later on the enclosed future pupa begins to be visible, and the ventral surface becomes more convex; the eyes also appear. The larval integument becomes too small for the growing insect, and splits longitudinally; and in the early pupal state it may be seen attached along the dorsal edges of the pupa-case. Margins somewhat thickened, the adjacent tubes forming minute crenulations, and within it the dorsum bears numbers of very small circular pores; from these and from the marginal tubes is produced a quantity of white waxy matter, some of which covers the dorsum in scattered patches, and the rest spreads round the larva in a very long fringe of delicate threads, frequently much longer than the insect itself! This waxy matter is very brittle, and, as a rule, the whole surface of a leaf is powdered over with the fragments, making the leaf look as if mildewed.\n\nJ. II. 14\nThe pupa-case, in the earliest stage, scarcely distinguishable from the late larva; afterwards as the insect grows, it becomes much thicker. The form remains elliptical; the length reaches about one-thirtieth in. The dorsal disk is slightly convex, flattened towards the margin; it is larger than the ventral disk, and slightly overlaps the sides, which are vertical. The hollow thus formed is covered by a ring of thin white wax, and there is also a plate of wax beneath the ventral surface; portions of this ring and of the plate are frequently seen amongst the long threads of the larva. The pupal margin is crenulated, but bears no fringe, and the dorsum has no pores or wax. The outline of the enclosed pupa may be made out indistinctly on the dorsum, and the rudimentary organs ventrally on turning over the case. Vasiform orifice subconical, with regularly convex sides, the anterior edge concave; operculum sub-elliptical; lingula very short, not extending beyond the operculum.\n\nAdult form unknown.\n\nHab.

There seems to be no fringe.\n\nPupa-case intense glossy black, slightly convex, with a median longitudinal ridge; abdominal segments indistinct. Form elliptical; length about one-twenty-fifth in. Dorsum bearing many long black spines, of which one series of from twenty to twenty-four are submarginal, the others scattered (seemingly about twenty, but very difficult to make out on account of the intense black colour); two of the spines, at the posterior extremity, are longer than the others. Margin with very small crenulations; there is a very short fringe of white wax, which in many specimens is not noticeable. Vasiform orifice broadly rhomboidal with rounded angles, anterior edge slightly concave; operculum semi-elliptical, covering about half the orifice; lingula short, roundly clavate. The larval exuviae are commonly seen attached by the dorsal spines to the pupa-case.\nThe pupa extracted from its case is reddish-yellow, the rudimentary feet and antenn\u00e6 yellow, the rudimentary wings yellow with bands of dark brown, the eyes dark-brown.\n\nAdult form with the thorax red, banded with brown; the abdomen red; genitalia brown; feet and antenn\u00e6 darkish-yellow, tipped with brown.

Read May 6th 1903.]\n\nOne of the most peculiar medicinal substances of the East is that called Silajit or Shilajatu. It is known by the former name in Hindi and Persian, and by the latter in Bengali and Sanskrit. The meaning of the term is derived from *Sila*\u2014a stone, and *jatu*\u2014produce or essence. It may therefore be regarded as a substance born of the rock, essence of stone, or, more literally, \"rock sweat.\"\n\nThe localities in which this article is reported to be found are confined to Northern India. It is obtained from the lower, central and upper ranges of the Himalayas and the Vindhyan hills, and is procurable in Simla, Mussoorie, and Katmandu. In Vadarikasvan, near Hardwar, a sacred retreat at the foot of the Himalayas, it is fairly abundant. It is brought down by Bhuteas and other hill tribes, and sold with such commodities as brick tea, incense, gums and precious stones.\n\nThe occurrence and formation of silajit is at present somewhat obscure. It appears as an exudation upon rocks, and, according to report, is contained in the substance of the rock. Silajit is collected during the hot weather in May and June, the heat of the sun is said to be necessary in drawing out the extract from the rocks. In Sanskrit works it is stated that silajatu imbibes the therapeutic properties of the metals with which it remains associated. The black variety, which is the most commonly available, is said to possess the properties of iron, and the white variety is said to exert the peculiar action of silver. The manner in which this exudation occurs, and the kinds of rocks which afford it, are matters requiring investigation. The collection is in the hands of shepherds and nomadic tribes, who can, of course, furnish no intelligent\naccount of its nature, or explain its origin with any degree of satisfaction.\n\nBefore describing what is at present recognised as medicinal silajit, it will be convenient to allude to the varieties of substances under this name which have been mentioned in Indian works or met with in the bazars.\n\nIn the first place, there is a kind of silajit which is of a mineral nature, and is a more or less pure native aluminium sulphate. This was described in 1833, by Mr. J. Stevenson, Superintendent of the Behar Saltpetre Factory (Jour. As. Soc. Beng. II. 321). It was found in Nepal, and was widely used as a medicine to cure green wounds and bruises. It occurred in small brownish-white lumps with a semi-crystalline structure internally. It consisted of 95 per cent. of aluminium sulphate with 3 per cent. of iron. It sold for the high price of two rupees for a rupee weight. In the same year Dr. A. Campbell, in a letter to the Asiatic Society, (Jour. As. Soc. Beng. II. 482) confirmed the existence and use of the alum earth, and stated that the average qualities contained only 66 per cent. of aluminium sulphate. The price of the product at Katmandu was from Rs. 11 to Rs. 15 a maund, but sold as a drug in the bazar, its price was purely fanciful. The rocks, it was suggested, might be lixiviated and be made to yield a larger supply, but it is very improbable that it could be obtained in sufficient quantities to be of commercial importance.\n\nMineral silajit was again referred to in 1846, by Capt. Sherwell in his account of Behar (Journ. As. Soc. Beng. XV. 58). This officer reported that a small quantity of alum was manufactured from shales in the Shahabad District; these rocks probably belonged to the pyritous shales of the Kaimur group of the Vindhyan series. The alum was sold at the high price of one rupee a tola. It was identical with the silajit of Nepal and was much esteemed as a drug.\n\nThat the mineral silajit does not all come from Nepal is confirmed by Dr. Hamilton in his account of Nepal, where he says: \"I have collected Salajit in Behar with my own hands.\"\n\nIn the \"Economic Geology of India,\" it is recorded that alum exudations or silajit are sometimes collected by the natives of Assam.\n\nMore recent geological investigations in India have not brought to light any fresh information regarding this aluminous mineral under the name of silajit, and although fresh deposits have been discovered, such as those in Baluchistan where it is called \"Phul-Mak,\" they have not been regarded as medicinal.\n\nThe second variety of this substance, called Black Silajit, is quite a different article to that just described. It is sold in the bazars of Calcutta,\nin Dehra Dun and Hardwar. The Kabirajis are aware of the distinction between the two products, and hold out a warning that the Nepal alum earth is not the silajit of Sanskrit writers; they state that the former is an article of Yun\u0101ni medicine, while the latter, or black kind, is only suitable for Hindu practitioners.\n\nDr. Campbell appears to be the first to discriminate between the two drugs. He says (Jour. As. Soc. Beng. II. 483): \"There is a dark bituminous substance used in Nepal, said to exude from rocks, and is called 'Black Salajit.' It resembles bituminous alum ore, but there is much vegetable matter in it, and it is probably a vegetable production, notwithstanding the belief by the Nepal physicians of its mineral nature.\"\n\nBlack silajit is sold in the form of brown or black cakes, tough or pasty in consistence, and having an odour of rancidity which has been stated in Sanskrit works to resemble that of cow's urine. The usual odour is that of leather. Its taste is bitter, saline, pungent and astrigent. The partially purified specimens of this black substance, as brought down by the Bhuteas, are in the form of rounded flattened cakes about $2\\frac{1}{2}$ inches in diameter and half an inch thick, or in sticks resembling liquorice juice. Silajat is hygroscopic, and when exposed to a damp atmosphere becomes unctuous and sticky. In a dry state it is quite hard, and breaks with a shining black fracture, and in course of time some samples assume a brownish crystalline efflorescence on the surface.\n\nBlack silajit is soluble for the most part in distilled water, yielding a dark reddish-brown extract with an alkaline reaction. Ether, alcohol and other volatile liquids have little or no solvent action upon it. In one case ether extracted a small amount of a fatty compound having an odour of Russian leather. The aqueous solution is precipitated by mineral acids, plumbic acetate and ferric chloride, but not by acetic acid or alkalis. The aqueous solution is not precipitated by four volumes of alcohol. The organic matter is of the nature of an organic acid, and, in the specimens I examined, not one was of a bituminous nature.\n\nThere is a large quantity of mineral matter or ash left on incinerating the samples, and as this consists mainly of carbonated alkalis, it is indicative of the presence of one or more organic acids combined with bases in the original extract. In Dr. U. C. Dutt's \"Materia Medica of the Hindus,\" p. 95, it is stated that the ashes left after burning silajatu on platinum foil, consist chiefly of lime, magnesia, silica, and iron in a mixed state of proto- and per oxide.\" It is said by the native doctors that the mineral constituents are regarded as impurities, and that the active principle is a cream-like body which rises to the surface of the liquid when the solid silajit is dissolved in hot water. The solution is placed in the\nsun until it thickens, the surface is removed, and this *sut-silajit* is allowed to dry.\n\nThat there is no uniform combination between the organic and mineral constituents is shown in the analysis of two specimens of black silajit supplied by two Kabirajis of Calcutta.\n\n|                | No. 1   | No. 2   |\n|----------------|---------|---------|\n| Water          | 7\u00b795    | 9\u00b734    |\n| Organic matter | 35\u00b705   | 55\u00b736   |\n| Mineral matter | 57\u00b700   | 35\u00b730   |\n|                | 100\u00b700  | 100\u00b700  |\n\nAsh soluble in water\n\n|                |         |\n|----------------|---------|\n| soluble in acid| 15\u00b755   |\n| insoluble      | 30\u00b755   |\n\nA more complete examination was made last year of four additional samples: No. 1, round cakes from Calcutta; No. 2, long flattened cakes from Calcutta; No. 3, from Jaunsar, through the Director Imperial Forest School, Dehra Dun; No. 4 from Bashahr Forest, Punjab, through the Curator, Imperial Forest Museum.\n\n|                | 1       | 2       | 3       | 4       |\n|----------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Water          | 9\u00b785    | 15\u00b790   | 11\u00b715   | 10\u00b799   |\n| *Organic matter| 56\u00b720   | 49\u00b786   | 51\u00b755   | 56\u00b786   |\n| \u2020Ash           | 34\u00b795   | 34\u00b724   | 37\u00b730   | 32\u00b715   |\n|                | 100\u00b700  | 100\u00b700  | 100\u00b700  | 100\u00b700  |\n\n*Including nitrogen*\n\n|                |         |\n|----------------|---------|\n| 1\u00b703           | .82     |\n| 3\u00b725           | 1\u00b726    |\n\n\u2020Containing\n\n|                |         |\n|----------------|---------|\n| Iron and alumina| 2\u00b724   |\n| Lime            | 4\u00b736    |\n| Magnesia        | 1\u00b750    |\n| Potash          | 9\u00b707    |\n| Soda            | 4\u00b711    |\n| Phosphoric acid | .16     |\n| Sulphuric acid  | .58     |\n| Chlorine        | .07     |\n| Carbonic acid, &c.| 11\u00b751 |\n| Silica          | 1\u00b735    |\n\nThe chief ingredients of the ash are the bases lime, magnesia, potash and soda, combined as carbonates. The absence of a large iron and alumina precipitate indicates the non-identity of this substance with the mineral silajit of Nepal and Behar.\n\nJ. ii. 15\nThe bulk of the organic material consists of an acid which is related to humic acid, a principle which by the way is not usually administered by the general practitioner. When the aqueous solution is precipitated by hydrochloric acid, and the precipitate washed and pressed, it readily dissolves in warm alcohol. The lead salt of the organic acid separated from the filtered solution, washed and dried, afforded 54\u00b791 per cent. of lead oxide. Heated in a dry test tube, the silajit evolved white alkaline fumes with a strong empyreumatic odour.\n\nThe crystals formed on the surface of cakes of black silajit are those of potassium and sodium carbonate.\n\nThere are a few points of resemblance between this article and the minerals belonging to the oxydised hydro-carbons. Dopplerite, for instance, (Ber. Akad. Wien. 2.287, 1899; 52.281, 1865) is an acid substance or mixture of different acids related to humic acid. It is insoluble in alcohol and ether. The ash ranges from 3 to 14 per cent. It is found in peaty beds, and shows the transition from peat to coal.\n\nIt will be necessary in a few words to refer to the third kind or white variety of silajit. Alum earth is sometimes supplied for this substance, but only as a fraudulent substitute. The original white silajatu is said to be obtained from crevices of rocks in the vicinity of Mount Abu, and this variety is used largely in Rajputana. A sample of white silajatu from Jeypur was shown to me two years ago. It was a cream-coloured crystalline compound with a strong nauseous odour. It was apparently of animal origin, and evolved gaseous ammonia when mixed with slaked lime. It yielded 64 per cent. of pure urea when determined from the amount of nitrogen given off by means of hypobromate of sodium. It was, therefore, crude urea or inspissated urine in a solid state. A reference to Taleef Shereef or Indian Materia Medica, edited in 1833 by Dr. George Playfair, throws some light upon this source of the drug. Art. 577. \"Silajeet is the urine of the wild hill-goat, which, when the animal is rutting, is discharged on the stones and evaporated by the sun's heat. It is found in small quantities. Some have said it is the urine of the wild ass, found as above.\"\n\nIn the Makhzan-ul-adwiyah, a Persian work on Materia Medica of great antiquity, it is said that silajit is generally found among the haunts of monkeys, and that the drug is the alvine discharge of a certain species with a black face and long tail. It distinguishes between the salajit-i-asli, a black gummy inodourous substance, and salajit-i-nagli, the evacuated substance with a nauseous odour and hard consistence. The medicinal virtues of silajit are set forth in the Makhzan-ul-adwiyah. Charaka, Susruta, Bhabaprokasha, and Bagbhata's Rasartna samuchchaya.\nIt has heating properties, and is used in piles, leprosy, pleurisy, worms, asthma, gonorrhoea, and it is a specific for debility and for kidney and bladder diseases. Dr. Hem Chandra Sen, in a recent paper on \"Shilajatu\" in the Indian Medical Record, for 14th and 21st May, 1902, recommends it as digestive and laxative, suitable for dyspepsia, diabetes, diseases of the liver and spleen, to regulate the action of the heart, and as a good respiratory stimulant and expectorant. And finally, it is said to be a sheet anchor in diseases of the genito-urinary organs and of the nervous system. The Taleef Shereef says: \"It is one of the most powerful remedies, and is stronger than any other ingredient in whatever formul\u00e6 it may form a part. It is the favourite medicine of all Hindu physicians.\" The author of Charaka says that there is no curable disease which will not yield to shilajatu in judicious combination with other drugs.\n\nThe medicinal uses of silajit are hence most varied, and it is difficult to realise what active therapeutic principles can affect this long list of ailments. Before European physicians can prescribe white, black, or brown silajit for any disorder, we must ascertain more exactly the nature of the chief ingredient, and be able to procure a regular supply of a uniformly prepared medicine. It is open to reason that no drug will become popular if no guarantee be given as to whether it belongs to the animal, vegetable or mineral kingdom.\n\nSilajit is allied to another ancient drug named moniyia which has long been employed in the East. The original drug is said to have been made from Egyptian mummies, and subsequently to have been prepared by boiling down and extracting the essence of Abyssinian boys. Since the last source of supply has become scarce, several bituminous exudations are reported to have been substituted. There is little doubt that some forms of silajit may be entered in this category.\n\nIn conclusion, it will be necessary to alter the definition of this substance given in Indian glossaries. In a geological work it is called \"Alum,\" and in more than one medical work it is termed \"Bitumen;\" but, from the evidence collated in the above notes, it is also an extractive matter containing an organic acid combined with alkalis, and almost completely soluble in water.\nA note on the discovery of Thanasimus sp.\\textsuperscript{1} \\textit{prox. nigricollis} in the N.-W. Himalayas with some remarks on its life-history.\u2014By E. P. Stebbing.\n\n[Received May 27th, 1903\u2014Read June 3rd, 1903.]\n\nIn June 1902, whilst touring in the Tehri Garhwal forests in the N.-W. Himalayas, the writer discovered and took a number of specimens of both larv\u00e6 and beetle of a species of \\textit{Thanasimus prox. nigricollis} Lewis, a beetle belonging to the family \\textit{Cleridae}. The insect was submitted to the well-known specialist, the Rev. H. S. Gorham, who has reported that, with the exception of a few minute differences which will require comparison with the types to settle, the insect is identical with G. Lewis\u2019 \\textit{T. nigricollis}, taken by the latter in Japan and described in the Ann. Soc. Nat. Hist., Vol. X (1892), p. 187. It is owing partly to these minute differences to its greater size and perhaps to a certain extent to the fact that there appears to be a curious close relationship between the insects found in parts of Japan and some of those of the N.-W. Himalayas, that I at present put the species as \\textit{prox. nigricollis}. In the case of another predaceous insect a \\textit{Niponius} (the first species of which genus were found by Lewis in Japan) the N.-W. Himalayan one has proved to be a different species to Lewis\u2019 Japanese ones.\n\nI think it may be shown that the discovery of this Thanasimus is one of very considerable importance, since it is predaceous upon several bark and wood boring \\textit{Scolytidae} which have been recently discovered to commit serious damage in the coniferous forests of the N.-W. Himalayan area. My observations tend to prove that it takes the place in this region of the well-known \\textit{Thanasimus formicarius} of the European coniferous forests. This latter clerid preys upon (to mention but two) the larv\u00e6 and adults of \\textit{Myelophilus piniperda} and \\textit{M. minor} which are amongst the principal scolytid enemies of the European pine forests, and is in consequence very rightly looked upon as an insect ally of the greatest value to the forester in those regions. So great, in fact, is the value attached to its predaceous habits that it was imported into some of the coniferous forests of North America in 1892. The initiation of this experiment, the first of its kind to be undertaken on a larger scale (in forest areas), came about in the following manner:\u2014Between 1900 and 1902 the pine trees in portions of Hampshire, Hardy, Grant, Pendleton, and Mineral counties, West Virginia; Bath, Highland, Augusta, and Rockingham counties, Virginia and also in portions of Maryville, died off in large numbers, the destruction being widespread and in some places universal. This wholesale mortality was soon traced to its origin, as countless numbers of small bark-beetles were found\n\n\\textsuperscript{1} \\textit{Clerus} sp. Steb. Dept. Notes Ins. aff. For. No. 2, p. 213 (1903).\nbreeding in the bark of the trees, the depredator being *Dendroctonus frontalis*. So greatly had the insect increased that healthy trees were attacked equally with sickly ones. Dr. D. A. Hopkins, Entomologist to the West Virginia Agricultural Experiment station, made several tours of examination of the infected areas, and his observations showing him that there were no predaceous or parasitic insects of sufficient importance in the forests to cope with the attack, he suggested the importation of some European ones. A study of the question narrowed this suggestion down to the experimental introduction of *T. formicarius*, and with assistance of some of the great Lumber Companies, who were being seriously affected by the widespread deaths of the trees in large areas of forest owned by them, funds were made available to enable Dr. Hopkins to visit some of the European coniferous forests with a view to the collection of the clerid and its importation to the other side of the Atlantic. This experiment was conducted to a satisfactory conclusion. I think the above short note will prove that the discovery of the presence of a similar insect in the great and important coniferous forests of North Western India is not without a considerable economic as well as scientific value.\n\nI give the following descriptions of the adult and larva:\n\n**Beetle.** Elongate stout and robust. Head and antenn\u00e6 black. Antenn\u00e6 11 jointed with joints slightly increasing in width upwards, the last three forming a small club, the last joint of which is largest. Prothorax black and hirsute dorsally. Elytra under the prothorax broad, and rounded at their apices; red on the basal quarter of their length, then black, the black being twice crossed by white wavy bands, the first a narrow one just above the juncture of the black with the red colour, this band being reflexed backwards towards the apex and not upwards as in *formicarius* and in other species, and the other a broad one placed about \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of their length up from the base. There is also a small white patch at the extreme apex. Legs black. Abdomen a bright vermilion red, its segments very mobile. Body somewhat short, flattened, pubescent. Long \\( \\sigma \\) 7\u00b75\u20139 millim. \\( \\sigma \\) 9\u201311 millim.\n\nI would suggest, with Mr. Gorham\u2019s permission, that the species, should it prove new (at this distance from the types I am unable to speak with any certainty upon this point) should be named *himalayensis* since it would be useful to mark the locality where so important an insect to foresters was discovered.\n\n**Larva.** General colour a bright pink. Head brown, flat, mandibles black. A brown dorsal patch on 1st thoracic segment and pair of brown spots situated dorsally on each of the two succeeding segments. These thoracic segments a paler pink than the following abdominal ones. Latter nine in number, bright pink to reddish pink\nexcept last which is narrower and brown posteriorly and terminates in two small black processes. The larv\u00e6 tapers anteriorly and has three pairs of legs on the thoracic segments and no others. It is slightly lighter in colour beneath. Long. 15-18 millim. (varies). A single specimen of the beetle was first taken on the 16th June at Kathian, in the Jaunsar Hills, but it was not until the 24th of the month that the insect was secured in any numbers; this was in the forests round Pajidhar in Tehri Garhwal. Some deodar fellings were being carried out in these forests, and trees, cut at the end of April and still lying unbarked upon the ground, were found to be full of the larv\u00e6 and adults of two recently discovered bark-boring Scolytidae, *Scotylus major* and *S. minor*, Steb. MS. The *Thanasimus* was discovered in some abundance, flying about over the trees or running about on the bark, whilst in the beetle and larval galleries beneath the latter its pink-coloured larv\u00e6 were numerous.\n\nBefore describing the life-history of the clerid, it will perhaps be advisable to describe the state of affairs at Pajidhar. It has been mentioned that deodar fellings had commenced towards the end of April, and were still being carried on at the time of the writer's visit. The trees cut were not barked, or in any way touched, until converted into timber\u2014chiefly sleepers. They therefore lay several months in the forest. The scolytid beetles above referred to commence laying the eggs of the first generation of the year towards the end of April or beginning of May. For this purpose they require the fresh bast layer of the deodar, preferring sickly trees and, more especially, newly felled ones in which the upward flow of sap has ceased. Failing such they will attack young, green, healthy trees. At Pajidhar the fellings had commenced at a most opportune time for the bark-borers and large numbers of females were attracted to the newly felled trees and at once burrowed into them and oviposited. Towards the end of June the larv\u00e6 from these eggs were full grown, and in many cases had changed to the pupal state. The larv\u00e6 were being attacked by the predaceous clerid grubs. A curious point about the life-history of these scolytid beetles, is that the female does not die as soon as she has finished laying her eggs, but remains in the long egg-gallery she bores in the bast layer and sap wood parallel to the long axis of the tree, or in the entrance gallery in the bark, and lives here until the larv\u00e6 are full grown, at times going up to the outside. When she finally dies she does so near the entrance hole, thus effectually blocking it up and preventing predaceous enemies from entering and feeding upon the pup\u00e6 at the end of the larval burrows. It would appear probable that this prolongation of life after oviposition is in some way connected with the protection of the young larv\u00e6. It was upon these female scolytid beetles that the adult clerid was feeding.\nLife History. It is possible that the *Thanasimus* is to be found on the wing more or less continuously from spring to the end of autumn in the localities which it affects. The eggs have not yet been discovered, but they are probably laid on the bark of the trees near or in the entrance holes of the bark beetles, and the young larv\u00e6, or hatching out, make their way down these tunnels into the egg galleries in the bast and sap wood and from thence into the larval galleries. My observations up to the present have shown that larv\u00e6 of all sizes are generally to be found in these situations between May and October. The length of time spent in the larval stage is at present unknown, but it is unlikely to be more than a month in the case of the summer generations. On becoming full grown the grubs go into the thick outer bark of the tree to pupate. This is to facilitate the beetle when mature leaving the tree. The adult never enters the tree. It is a brightly-coloured, very active insect, running and flying well even in hot sunshine, and it spends its life flying round or running about on the bark of the trees. Its food consisting of bark and wood boring *Scolytidae*, it searches for these on the bark, since it is much too bulky to enter their tunnels, and seizes them whilst they are engaged in either boring into or tunneling their way out of the tree. In the case of the *Scolytus major* and *minor* beetles, upon which it was preying when discovered, it would appear that they form its food for some weeks or months during the year, since they remain alive after egg-laying and until the larv\u00e6 are full grown. The mother beetles spend their time walking up or down the egg-gallery, or going up the entrance hole to the outside and the *Thanasimus* watches at the mouth of these holes and seizes and devours the beetles when they appear at the mouth of the tunnel. They only feed upon living beetles, and will not touch dead ones, and they catch their prey by sight only and not by scent: unless the bark beetle is right in front of them they will pass it by unnoticed. I was able to definitely ascertain this point by a number of experiments. Beetles kept for twenty-four hours without food passed close to their prey without noticing it although they were in a ravenous condition. It would appear that they only see directly in front, and this is borne out by the position of the eyes which are placed rather forwardly upon the head. When, however, the scolytid comes within their range of vision they pounce upon it, just as a tiger does, with one rush and if out of its hole the bark beetle has not the remotest chance of escape. I have not been able as yet to observe whether they ever take their prey upon the wing. The clerid seizes the bark-borer with its anterior legs and mandibles, picks it up off the ground, turns it round so as have the ventral surface facing it with the head uppermost, sits well back on its hind legs and commences to feed upon its\nprey, whose struggles are quite ineffectual in that deadly grip. In commencing to devour the scolytid it invariably begins with the head; it fastens its mandibles round the junction of the head and prothorax, following the parallel of the tiger, and chews and sucks at the head until it has finished this completely. It next goes to work on the prothorax, piercing with ease through the hard chitinous shell with its powerful mandibles and breaking it to pieces, the contents being entirely cleaned out and consumed, for the beetle is a neat feeder, and entirely clears the meat off the chitinous bone before rejecting it. Having finished the prothorax, it throws away the mangled shell and turns its attention to the body consisting of the meso- and meta-thorax and abdomen. In a bark beetle this is often in the shape of a blunt elliptical cylinder with a flattish top where it joins the prothorax. The beetle holds this between its front legs, the meso-thoracic end upwards, and proceeds to first pull off the elytra which are rejected: the under wings being consequently released open out to their full extent but remain attached to the trunk. The clerid then entirely cleans out this bottle-shaped cylinder, as neatly as one could clean out a jar with a spoon. When quite empty, it is thrown away and the insect starts off in search of another bark-beetle. A mangled prothoracic shell and the empty chitinous body cylinder with the outspread lower wings attached to it are all that are left of a S. major beetle six minutes from the moment it was captured alive. I have seen three such eaten consecutively, and of 20 beetles put in with four clerids only the above mentioned portions remained when the box was inspected $3\\frac{1}{2}$ hours afterwards. As has been already mentioned the resemblance between this insect and the tiger in its methods of rushing upon, seizing, and commencing to feed upon its prey is remarkable, the difference being that the insect is more cruel than the mammal since it makes no pretence of killing the bark-beetle, but commences on it whilst it is alive and kicking, often bringing forward its middle pair of legs to assist in holding its struggling prey. As an instance of its tenacity and rapacity I may quote the following. In common with most insects the clerid dislikes being upon its back and when so placed makes violent efforts to right itself. A beetle had been placed in a tube with two Platypus (Platypod\u00e6) beetles. It at once seized one and, though shaken violently about, clung to its victim and, falling on its back and finding it impossible to right itself at once, gave up the attempt and consumed its prey in this position, before restarting its struggles to resume the normal position. It then made an effort to seize the second Diapus but was removed as the writer wished to preserve the latter. The insect is polygamous. A \u2642 kept in a box with three \u2640 and fed with bark borers for four days, paired with one or other of the three whenever it was not\nfeeding or searching for its prey. In pairing the \u2642 rushes at the \u2640 from behind with the same impetuosity with which it pounces upon its prey, mounts on her back and thrusts the tip of his very flexible abdomen downwards, curling it round till it reaches the tip of the abdomen of the \u2640. The latter is at times larger than the \u2642 though it may be of the same size. She walks about carrying the male whilst pairing lasts. I have not yet ascertained how long the beetles spend in the adult stage of their life-history. It is evidently several days and may extend to a week or two. We have seen that larv\u00e6 of all sizes (and consequently probably ages) are to be found in the scolytid larval tunnels during the spring and summer months (they have been so found in May, June, July, August, and September) and therefore with the long life of the beetle it is probable that the generations overlap, this meaning a continuous supply of larv\u00e6 and beetles throughout the spring, summer, and autumn. It will be shown later on how excessively important this fact is.\n\nTo sum up my observations on the habits of the \u2642, I may say that when not eating or searching for bark-beetles it is pairing or vice versa and the \u2640, at any rate up to the time she commences egg-laying, appears to be an equally large and voracious feeder. Since the insect is fully twice as large as its European confr\u00e8re, being from 8 to 10 millim. and more in length, whilst the bark-beetles are much of the same size as the European ones, from 2\u00b75 to 5\u00b75 millim., it is naturally capable of consuming in its lifetime a far larger number of beetles and it will therefore be readily understood that the beetle is a valuable ally to have in forests where bark-boring insects may assume the form of serious pests in seasons favourable to themselves.\n\nFood. With the exception of one specimen taken on the wing in the middle of June, which was probably feeding upon Diapus impressus Jans., the insect may be said to have been first discovered feeding upon Scolytus major and minor in Deodar on the 24th June. From the study of the life-histories\\(^1\\) of these latter beetles, which I have been able to make, it is certain that they are to be found in the adult state from the end of April (the beginning of spring when insect life commences to re-awake in the N.-W. Himalayas after its winter hibernation) to the end of June, or perhaps as late as the end of the first week in July. The beetles from the eggs laid at the end of April and beginning of May, begin to appear on the wing at the end of July or early in August and are to be found throughout that month and on into September. It is thus evident that with but a short interval of three weeks or so this form of food-supply is available for the clerid from its resumption of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Vide Steb., Depart. Notes on Ins. aff. For., No. 1, p. 45. Id., No. 2, pp. 203-212.\nactivity in the spring until the autumn. That the insect has an adequate food-supply will be evident from the following facts:\n\nFrom calculations made from measurements and countings taken in the forest I estimated that in a deodar tree of a hundred feet length of bole and three feet diameter at base which had been felled at the end of April and in which the scolytids had deposited their eggs in the bast layer from top to base, a first generation of some 56,300 adults was produced in July-August. Taking but 50 per cent. of the eggs (S. major lays about 60 and S. minor 40 per brood) laid (these being those of the second generation of the year) by these 56,300 beetles as arriving at maturity, we have the enormous total of 1,550,000 beetles at the end of the year, the result of the eggs laid in but one tree in the spring. I may say that in this calculation large deductions have been made to allow for over-estimation, &c., the large number of beetles which oviposited in the giant crown of the tree and their resultant offspring being left out of account altogether. Experiment has shown, however, that the Thanasimus is by no means dependent upon the Scolytus beetles for its food-supply as it will devour with almost, if not quite, equal avidity, various other scolytid pests found in the region of its known activity. I have fed it with the following beetles:\n\n1. Bark-boring species (i.e., those species which confine their attacks to the bast layer of the trees attacked).\n\n   * Scolytus major Steb. MS.\n   * S. minor Steb. MS.\n   * Polygraphus major Steb. MS.\n   * P. minor Steb. MS.\n   * Pityogenes conifer\u00e6 Steb. MS. (Blue pine, Deodar and Pinus Gerardiana).\n   * Tomicus sp. (Blue pine and Spruce).\n\n2. Wood-boring species (i.e., those species which bore right into the wood of the tree and oviposit in it).\n\n   * Rhyncholus sp. (Blue pine, Spruce, and perhaps Deodar)\n   * Hylastes sp. (Blue pine and Spruce).\n   * Diapus impressus Jans. (Quercus incana).\n   * Platypus? sp. (Deodar).\n\nAll the above are coniferous insects, with the exception of the Diapus impressus which bores into the wood of the oak Quercus incana.\n\nThis Thanasimus would therefore appear to be fairly omnivorous where bark-beetles are concerned, attacking freely many different species and in this resembling its European confr\u00e8re T. formicarius.\n\nI think the above short note on its habits will support and confirm the opinion held by the writer, as to the great value and importance of the presence of such an insect in the N.-W.

But the larger part of it is occupied by a joint account by the authors of the species of the Order Rubiace\u00e6, which are characterised by having more ovules than one in each cell of the ovary. The key which precedes the text is only for these genera. In a paper which the authors hope soon to submit to the Society they will deal with the species of the genera which have only a single ovule in each ovarian cell; and that paper will, in like manner, be preceded by a key to these uniovular genera.\n\nWith the exception of the important family of Leguminos\u00e6, which was elaborated entirely by Major D. Prain, of the Botanic Garden, Calcutta, and of one genus of Melastomace\u00e6, which was done in conjunction with Dr. O. Stapf, chief assistant in the Kew Herbarium, the whole of the orders dealt with in the preceding thirteen parts of these Materials have been worked out by Sir George King. With the view of expedit-\ning the completion of the series, and in consideration of the liberality of the Government of the Straits Settlements which has made feasible a more rapid rate of publication, it has been arranged that Mr. J. S. Gamble will henceforth, in the majority of the orders belonging to Corolliflorae and Incomplet\u00e6, work in collaboration with Sir George King; while certain orders will be worked out independently by botanical friends, who have kindly promised their aid.\n\nOrder LVIII.

The single sheet bearing the No. 6112 in the Wallichian Herbarium at Burlington House has two things glued down on it, viz., two twigs of U. Gambier, Roxb., and a third twig which must, by exclusion, be this. Unfortunately a specimen exactly resembling this third twig, collected by Finlayson and probably, like so many of his plants, in Siam, was issued by Wallich under the number 6103 D. and the name U. Gambier, while another also exactly like it, but collected in Sylhet, was issued by him under the number 6107 and the name U. sessilifolia. I have seen no Malayan specimens which resemble these two except the one attributed by Wallich to Singapore, which I, therefore, believe must have been so attributed as the result of some confusion of specimens at the time of issue.\n\n7.

Probably about 15 species; tropical Asiatic.\n\nThe above definition is limited so as to include only the pentamerous many-seeded species which in Hooker's Flora of British India are included in the genus Webera of Schreber (founded in 1791). Some recent authors refer these species to Tarenna a genus established by Gaertner in 1788 for T. Zeylanica (Gaertner, Fruct.\nGaertner however, defines and figures *Tarenna* as tetramerous. We therefore for these pentamerous species revive the genus *Stylocoryna* (established in 1797 by Cavanilles; Cav. Ic. IV. 46, t. 368) which that author describes as pentamerous and many-seeded. For the genus *Webera* of Schreber we reserve in the present work certain tetramerous uni-ovulate plants which in external characters resemble *Ivora* and *Pavetta*. In Engler's *Pflanzen-familien* Webera, Schreb., is reduced to *Chomelia*, a genus founded by Linn\u00e6us in 1737.

The only differences are that the leaves of the former are depicted as ovate-lanceolate and 2-25 to 3 in. long; the limb of the corolla as yellow, its tube as '75 in. long and white; the calyx under '2 in. long with teeth one quarter of its length; while Randia rigida is shown as having ovate leaves only 1-5 in. long; corolla-limb white and the tube 1 in. long, also white; the calyx '3 in. long with filiform teeth half as long as the tube. The former he attributes to Nepal, the latter to Singapore. The two are evidently forms of the same widely distributed species.\n\n12. RANDIA LONGIFLORA, Lam. Dict. II. 227; Ill. t. 156, f. 3. A glabrous shrub, sometimes scandent, usually armed; young branches twice as thick as a crow-quill, or thicker, pale-brown, shining, usually bearing stout curved axillary spines '3 in. or more in length.

It differs from the other sheets which belong to *Randia longiflora* in its greatly longer calyx and also larger more coriaceous corolla, which has a wider tube, glabrous in the throat as elsewhere, included anthers, and a much shorter stigma which opens out into 2 short broad lobes. The leaves of this are also larger and thicker than those of *R. longiflora*.\n\n14. **Randia Penangiana**, King & Gamble n. sp. A large glabrous armed climber; young branches twice as thick as a crow-quill, dark coloured when dry, armed with stout axillary recurved spines 3 in. long. *Leaves* thickly membranous, elliptic, sometimes slightly obovate, shortly and bluntly acuminate, the base cuneate, both surfaces brown when dry, the lower somewhat the paler and tinged olivaceous; main-nerves 5 to 7 pairs, rather straight, oblique, faint on both surfaces;\nlength 3 to 4\u00b75 in.; breadth 1\u00b75 to 2\u00b75 in. petiole 2 to 3 in. slender; stipules shorter than the petioles, broadly triangular at the base, much acuminate upwards. Cymes terminal or from the axils of fallen leaves, on pedicels about 2 in. long; the branches short and bearing persistent ovate-acute bracteoles. Flowers few, about 2 in. long, on pedicels about 2 in. long. Calyx 4 in. long, tubular, tapering to the base, the mouth with 5 triangular acute short teeth. Corolla salver-shaped; the tube 1 in. long and about 1 in. in diam.; the limb about 1 to 1\u00b725 in. across, deeply divided into 5 broadly elliptic subacute lobes. Anthers linear, with a black apical process from the connective, included in the slightly pubescent throat, sessile, dorsifixed, about 2 in. long. Style filiform; stigma somewhat exserted, thick, clavate, opening out into 2 thick spatulate reflexed fleshy lobes. Fruit depressed-globular, glabrous, 5 to 6\u00b75 in. in diam. when dry.\n\nPenang: Curtis 927. Singapore: Hullett, 114.\n\nThe following, of which we have seen no specimens in flower, also probably belong to this species; viz: Malacca: Derry 1056. Perak: Scortechini 1538; King's Collector 10171. One of Mr. Curtis's specimens is described as a tree, another as a climber. The leaves are thinner and broader than those of R. floribunda, Lam., and the flowers are (especially as regards the limb of the corolla) larger. The calyx although of the same shape is also larger. This species still more nearly resembles R. Clarkei, King & Gamble (of which the type is Wall. Cat. 8284 D,) but it has smaller, much less coriaceous leaves, which are broader in proportion to their width. This has also smaller flowers with a very much smaller calyx. From both it differs by its conspicuously apiculate anthers.\n\n15. Randia exaltata, Griff. Notul. IV. 262. A tree 30 to 50 feet high, unarmed; young branches deciduously pubescent, ultimately glabrous, dark-coloured and striate when dry, thinner than a goose-quill.

Cymes in the axils of leaves or of fallen leaves, when in flower half as long as the leaves, adpressed rusty-pubescent; branches few, bearing small persistent acute bracts and 4 to 6 large shortly pedicellate flowers. Calyx 1\u00b75 in. long, funnel-shaped; densely adpressed-pubescent outside, the mouth truncate but minutely 5-toothed. Corolla white, somewhat purplish, 2 in. or more long, rather sparsely adpressed-pubescent outside; the tube narrowly cylindric, only about 3 in. long, villous at the throat; the limb widely funnel-shaped, scurfily hairy inside; the mouth with 5 broad subacute lobes 3 or 3\u00b75\nin. long.

Stebbing.\n\n[Received 21st June, 1903\u2014Read 1st July, 1903.]\n\nIn a paper read before the Members of this Society in April last I gave an account of the mode of development of the alar appendages of the Spruce form of Chermes abietis pice\u00e6, Steb. MS.* I propose to describe here in detail the further observations I have been able to make up to the present on the life-history of this exceedingly interesting insect. In order to make the somewhat complicated stages of life passed through understood, and the subsequent parts of this paper intelligible, it will be first necessary to give some short description of the various forms this insect assumes in its different generations.\n\n* Vide No. 2, p. 57 of this Volume.\nC. abietis-piceae closely resembles its European confr\u00e8re C. abietis-laricis in the fact that the individuals of one generation may assume different habits at different stages of their existence, and so set up the phenomenon known as parallel series. Further different stages in the life-history may be passed on plants of a different species, the host plants in India being the Spruce and Silver fir instead of the Spruce and Larch as in Europe. Blochmann, Dr\u00e9fus, and Cholokovsky have made a series of the most important and interesting observations into these habits in the case of the European species within the last two decades or so, but the fact that a closely allied species lives in a somewhat similar manner on conifers in the N.-W. Himalayas seems to have remained unknown until discovered by the writer in 1901.\n\nBefore proceeding to describe in detail the stages as yet observed in this complex life-history, I may briefly run over the points which give rise to the phenomenon known as 'parallel series.'\n\nIn the early spring wingless \u2640 of the Chermes are to be found upon the Spruce trees, they probably having hibernated upon them through the winter. These \u2640 lay eggs from which shortly hatch out young larv\u00e6 which feed at the base of the young developing needles, causing them to swell up and coalesce into a pseudo-gall within which the aphids become enclosed. When fully grown about July the galls open, the larv\u00e6 crawl out, moult, and become fully developed winged insects. Some of them remain on the Spruce and lay eggs on it. A portion however of this winged gall generation leaves the Spruce and flies to the silver fir and lays eggs on it on the bark of the twigs or stem. The parthenogenetic \u2640 which arise from these eggs either hibernate upon the trees and lay their eggs in the early spring of the ensuing year, or lay the eggs in the autumn. These eggs are covered with a white cottony substance which can be seen in the form of white specks all over the branches, and often all over the whole of the stems of young saplings. Each little white cottony mass contains a large number of eggs. From these eggs hatch out in the spring small larv\u00e6 which crawl up on to the newly-developed young silver fir needles and feed by sucking out the sap from them. It would appear that whilst some of this generation go on to the winged form, others remain on the needles and mature and lay eggs on them without ever acquiring wings or leaving the tree. A part of this generation, however, always acquires wings about the beginning of July, and these winged insects then fly to the Spruce tree and lay their eggs on the bark of the stem (in young trees) or branches.\n\nMy observations in the case of the Indian species seem to prove that either form in the two series can remain for a prolonged period on the one host tree before producing the winged generation which enables it to\nreturn to the alternative host plant. This is evidently the case with the silver fir series, since eggs have been found on needles which only opened from the bud in May, and therefore could not have been those of the autumn or winter stem mothers of the previous season. These eggs hatched out, and quite young larv\u00e6 were found on the fully-developed silver fir needles six weeks after the spring larv\u00e6 had first appeared. There also appear to be other forms of the Chermes, and their feeding causes the silver fir needles of the year to become distorted and to curl and twist up, the individual needles being stuck together by the copious sticky excretions of the Aphid\u00e6. This is especially noticeable on young plants, at times 70 % to 80 % of the terminal portions of the branches being treated in this way.\n\nI will now proceed to consider these life-cycles separately, first dealing with the stages on the Spruce, and subsequently with those upon the silver fir.\n\n**The Chermes on the Spruce.**\n\nAt the beginning of May, 1901, an examination of the Spruce at elevations of between 8,000 and 9,500 ft. in Jaunsar Barwar, in the N.-W. Himalayas showed small pinkish-white cone-shaped masses appearing here and there on the side branches. At the base of these in the axil between the branch and the cone (which was an unopened bud) masses of elliptical reddish eggs were to be observed, the mass being partially covered by the dried skin of the stem mother who died as soon as she had laid them. I have not as yet definitely ascertained whether these eggs were laid in the previous autumn or in the April of the year in which they were found. If at the latter period the stem mother evidently lays very early in the season, as snow was still lying in shady spots that year at the beginning of May at elevations of 9,000 ft. In the first week of the month a careful inspection showed young larv\u00e6 emerging from these eggs, and on cutting a section vertically through the small cone, young larv\u00e6 were visible in numbers between the bases of the young needles. Under the microscope these larv\u00e6 were seen to be minute red aphids furnished with a pair of antenn\u00e6 consisting of two large basal joints followed by a narrower longer one which is surmounted by a hair. The beak was long and coiled, and three pairs of short legs were present. These minute larv\u00e6 were engaged in feeding upon the juices of the young undeveloped needles of which the pink gall consisted. Other patches of eggs examined were seen to be in a less advanced state, the bud above them having only just commenced to increase in size. The irritation set up by the young larv\u00e6 feeding at the bases of the needles soon causes the bud to swell, but instead of opening out into a short stiff brush of needles it develops into a gall or pseudo-\ncone shaped green mass. When quite young there is no partitioning off into distinct cells to be observed within the cone, but as the swelling under this constant irritation continues, the interior gradually becomes divided off into distinct compartments, in each of which numbers of the young larv\u00e6 are to be found engaged in sucking up the juices of the walls of the compartment. In the third week of May this partitioning is already distinct, and a section of the small gall, which is by then bright green externally, and pyramidal in shape, will show a number of chambers situated on either side of a central axis. The young aphids are still bright crimson in colour, with legs and antenn\u00e6 light yellow. No indications of wings are apparent at this period. As the gall becomes partitioned off inside the outside presents distinct diamond-shaped surfaces, each of which is the cover to a chamber below. A centre spot in each of these surfaces is lighter-coloured than the rest, and may form a minute projection. This would appear to represent the tip of the swollen up needle. It is nevermore than a minute projection, and in this differs from the European Spruce Chermes gall in which the spine or leaf top projects to some distance beyond the cone surface and can be seen to be the true upper portion of the needle. The false cone continues to steadily increase in size throughout June, and the young larv\u00e6 turns to a dark purple colour. They moult several times whilst in the chamber, and the white papery cast skins can be found in the cavities. From 6 to 8, or at times an even greater number of larv\u00e6 inhabit each chamber.\n\nSeveral cones may often be found upon the same branch, and the writer has seen young trees absolutely loaded with these pseudo-galls. I have already described to the members of this Society* the manner in which the larv\u00e6 leave the false cone and develop their wings. A certain number of them on acquiring these fly off to the Silver Fir where they may be found in the first half of July clinging to the new year's needles.\n\nThe subsequent history of these winged forms from the Spruce has not as yet been traced.\n\n**The Chermes on the Silver Fir.**\n\nThe presence of the spring eggs on the silver fir is easily discernible, since they are invariably covered or partially covered with a white cottony material. At times this substance is so abundant as to clothe the bark of young trees more or less thickly from top to bottom, either entirely encircling the stem or occupying one or two sides only. At other times it is to be found only upon the upper portion of the stem of\n\n* Vide No. 2, p. 57 of this Volume.\nold trees and saplings or on portions of some of the side branches. Tops, leading shoots and branches, covered in this way with what look to be white fungous filaments, are often seen to be dying or dead and dried up. Round Deoban (elev. 9,300 ft.) in the Jaunsar Barwar Forests a number of both young and old trees have these dead tops. I have, however, up to date been quite unable to discover any cause for this dying off of the tops. It does not take place in patches but here and there in the forest. It will, of course, require very careful investigations carried out over a series of years before we are in a position to say whether the Chermes is in any way accountable for this state of affairs.\n\nOn examining the cottony patches with a lens, one sees that this white wool-like material forms a covering to a blackish skin. This skin is that of the dried-up stem mother Chermes. At her anal end a portion of a bunch of yellowish brown elliptical glossy eggs is visible, the rest of them being hidden beneath the dried-up skin. The eggs are superficially very similar to those to be found upon the Spruce at this period (the beginning of May). These eggs were present in millions on infested silver firs at the beginning of May 1901. Little larv\u00e6 were observed hatching out from the eggs about the first week in the month, and these at once crawl up on to the young newly-developed or developing silver fir needles, at that period just bursting through the bud scales, where they appear as minute black specks covering the young bright green tassels of needles. Seen beneath the microscope the young larv\u00e6 are apparently identical with those to be found at the same time on the Spruce.\n\nYoung Larva.\u2014Red to crimson in colour, with two large basal antennal joints followed by a longer narrower one, this latter being surmounted by a bristle. Three pairs of short legs with two jointed tarsi, nine abdominal segments and a long curved proboscis.\n\nWithin a few days the young larv\u00e6 develop a white cottony covering. To the naked eye the young grubs appear to be surrounded by a white fungus. The microscope shows this however to be a white wooly substance which grows or is excreted all over the dorsal surface of the body. Towards the end of the third week in May these small aphids appear to become fullgrown, and they then lay the grape-bunch like masses of eggs of a new generation. They then die, the dead body skin remaining as a cover or partial cover to the eggs as in the case of the winter stem mother.\n\nSince the whole of this first series of larv\u00e6 spend their lives upon the newly developed needles of the year, it becomes evident that this first generation of the year, or a portion of it, is a short-lived one; only stem females arising from the eggs, a winged generation being entirely\nThe eggs so laid hatch within a week of being laid, and the young larv\u00e6 spread out over the undersurfaces of the still young green needles and remain feeding on them. At times these undersurfaces are quite black with the numbers of dark crimson-coloured larv\u00e6 attached to them. The production of these apterous forms continues until the first week in July, i.e., up to the period when the monsoon rains burst over the Himalayas.\n\nTowards the end of May, however, or beginning of June, the apterous crimson larv\u00e6 collect at the base of the needles and on the needle-bearing shoots. The irritation set up by their sucking operations causes the needles to draw together into a kind of corkscrew-shaped bud, the needles being twisted round one another and stuck together by the sugary excretion from the aphids. This excretion is also added to by an exudation of turpentine from the plant and round nodules of resin are to be found in the axils of the needles. A new and larger form of larv\u00e6 now begins to appear, yellowish in colour. These yellow aphids are to be found in the axil at the base of each needle, each having its proboscis firmly fixed in the tissue of the stem or leaf base. In addition to these yellow apterous forms a winged generation began to appear on the trees at the beginning of June. The winged insects found at this stage were on the twisted-up silver fir needles.\n\nApterous yellow larva.\u2014Bright canary yellow with two curled, white, cottony, whisp-like tails at the posterior extremity of its body. Patches of the white cottony material are also present elsewhere on body. The proboscis is short; antenn\u00e6 six-jointed.\n\nWinged form.\u2014Dark orange-yellow in colour. Four wings large and black.\n\nThe crimson-coloured larv\u00e6 in the cotton developed stage of their existence are also numerous within the corkscrew-twisted needles.\n\nThe action of the insects at this stage is to contort and dwarf all the new shoots attacked. Some young trees were found with 90% of the new leaves treated in this way, whilst the branches below and the stem shewed numerous patches of eggs covered by the white cottony substance.\n\nA few days later I was able to note that the yellow larv\u00e6 are also to be found in the open on needles which are not twisted-up in the corkscrew manner. Later on I found a winged form of the apterous yellow larva.\n\nWinged form of apterous yellow larva\u2014Yellow green, with light silvery wings, one and three-quarters to twice the length of body; proboscis yellow as are the legs.\n\nObservations were continued up to the first week in July upon these\nvarious forms of the Chermes upon the silver fir, and the following summary of conclusions arrived at is given here:\n\nAs already seen, eggs placed in branches at the base of the leaf buds hatch out in May, as the young needles unfold, and the minute larv\u00e6 crawl up on to the leaves. After a time these young larv\u00e6 apparently develop the white cottony substance and then die and lay fresh eggs on the needles. Later on a generation from these eggs (or a portion of the first generation) collect down towards the base of the needles, and feeding here set up an irritation which results in an exudation of turpentine, and also causes the needles to curl up in a corkscrew manner, the sticky excretions binding them together into a large twisted bud. Within or near the corkscrew bud the following are to be found:\n\n(a) Ordinary crimson-coloured larval form.\n(b) Yellow apterous form.\n(c) The yellow-green, silvery winged forms.\n(d) A few dark orange-coloured black-winged forms.\n\nBy the end of the first week in July the twisted-up leaves are found to contain numerous eggs covered by the usual dead mother skin and white cottony substance. These are also to be found on the twig and stem of the tree and are very visible. The apterous yellow larv\u00e6 will now have mostly left the corkscrew buds, and the numerous white papery skins on the twigs and the untwisted needles in the neighbourhood showed that they moulted after quitting the deformed shoots. This moult, I am of opinion, is the last one gone through, the Chermes after shedding this last skin appearing as the light green and yellow silvery-winged insect described above. Although the writer has not absolutely watched the change in colour, he is of opinion that the orange-yellow dark-winged forms are but a later stage of the bright coloured silvery forms, the bright tints assumed after the last change of skin darkening in a similar manner to that of the Spruce gall form described in the previous paper read before this Society. This winged form will probably fly off to the Spruce and lay eggs on it in a similar manner to that of the Spruce gall form which flies to the silver fir on leaving the pseudo-cone and acquiring its wings. I am not prepared as yet, however, to say exactly what happens to these winged forms. I found many dead upon the trees, and this would point to their lives being short in this stage. It is probable that during the heaviest of the monsoon rains the Chermes would not be active, and it is possible that this season is passed in the egg stage. I have not yet had an opportunity of observing whether the aphid resumes its activity during the brilliant warm autumn months which succeed the monsoon season in the Himalayan Region.\nThe occurrence of Melanterite in Baluchistan.\u2014By David Hooper, F.C.S.\n\n[Received 27th May, 1903. Read 3rd June, 1903.]\n\nDuring the last cold weather, Mr. R. Hughes-Buller, C.S., Superintendent, Imperial Gazetteer, Baluchistan, forwarded several samples of economic products to the Indian Museum for identification. Among these were two specimens of minerals called Khaghal and Pulmadk which were employed in the Brahui method of dyeing in conjunction with pomegranate husk in producing black or deep green colours.\n\nA special interest attaches to the production of Khaghal, otherwise known as Zagh, on account of a note drawn up by Mirza Sher Mahomed, describing one of the mines in the Jalawan district. It appears that the collection of Khaghal is a regular industry in two or three localities in Baluchistan. One of the mines is about forty miles from Nargana, and at Tango, about a mile distant, is another mine, situated at the foot of the hill and on the bank of a river. The entrance to the mine is an opening about a yard wide leading into a gallery of unknown length. The Zagh has been collected from these mines for several years, and although large quantities of mineral have been taken away, only a small area of about two yards has been worked. It is always mixed with a slate-like stone. The narrow gallery forming the mine is called \"Ragh,\" a vein of the hill. The inhabitants say that after a rainfall pure white Zagh \"bursts out\" in the mine which in the dry weather is dug out together with the decomposed slate. The mine has a disagreeable corrosive smell \"like iron rust,\" and this causes the workmen to vomit in the course of half an hour. Further samples were sent by Mr. Hughes-Buller, one from Ladon Pass, said to be of superior quality, and another from Bhapar which was very inferior. It has also been discovered at Chotok on the Kil river, Mula Pass, and at two places at Khuzdar.\n\nThe mine at Chotok is in a gorge, at a distance of six miles west of Janh. Here a cave is formed in the hill with a pool of warm water, noted for its mineral properties, and overhead is a rock from which water drops from innumerable stalactites of fantastic shape. The length of the pool is 150 yards, through which guides conduct visitors after they have undressed. At about ten yards from the entrance of the gorge is a large cave on the bed of which the mineral incrustation known\nas Khaghal forms. This is of a yellow colour and is said to be in an excellent condition for dyeing purposes.\n\nUpon examining the samples of Khaghal it was soon discovered that they were impure forms of ferrous sulphate or green copperas. The sample from Ladon Pass contained 30\u00b71 per cent., of anhydrous ferrous sulphate, and that from Kil Chotok 27\u00b736 per cent. Analyses of the water-soluble portions of the minerals revealed the fact that in addition to the iron salt sulphates were present of other available metals peculiar to the rock. The following tables indicate the composition:\n\n|                | Ladon Pass | Kil Chotok |\n|----------------|------------|------------|\n| FeSO\u2084          | ...        | 30\u00b710      |\n| Al\u2082\u2083SO\u2084        | ...        | 4\u00b750       |\n| CaSO\u2084          | ...        | 3\u00b712       |\n| MgSO\u2084          | ...        | 1\u00b720       |\n| K\u2082SO\u2084          | ...        | .74        |\n| Na\u2082SO\u2084         | ...        | 2\u00b706       |\n|                | 41\u00b772      | 39\u00b779      |\n\nThe minerals contained about 40 per cent. of matter insoluble in water consisting of silica, iron, alumina and lime. These estimations leave a balance of about 20 per cent. which might be referred to water of crystallisation.\n\nThe specimen of Khaghal from Bhapar yielded to hot water only a small quantity of sulphate of alumina with traces of calcium sulphate, and was therefore almost valueless as a dye or mordant.\n\nMelanterite or native ferrous sulphate is usually the product of the decomposition of pyrites and occurs as an efflorescence on the out-crop of rocks containing a considerable quantity of this mineral. But in volcanic regions it appears to be formed by the chemical action of sulphurous vapours upon siliceous and oxidised ores of iron. There are volcanic regions in Baluchistan where sulphur is obtainable and where sulphurous fumes are constantly acting upon the surrounding rocks converting the metals into sulphates. The Khaghal mines of Nargana and Chotok provide the conditions of warmth, air, and moisture necessary to promote the combination of sulphurous acid and iron and the ultimate conversion into crystallised sulphate.\n\nIron sulphate has already been found in India in the following places: Shekawati, Rajputana; hills of the Kakur district, Afghanis-\n\n---\n\n1 J. C. Brooke, *J. As. Soc. Beng.*, Vol. xxiii., 529.\ntan;\u00b9 in the Ramganga and Garja Valleys, in Kumaon;\u00b2 on shales of the Kaimur tableland, Central Provinces;\u00b3 in the Langyin Valley, Central Assam; and at the headwaters of the Attaran River, Tenasserim.\u2074 That the green copperas as used as a dye is often very impure, is shown by an analysis of a sample made by J. Stevenson in Bihar\u2075 who found 39 per cent. of anhydrous ferrous sulphate; the pure crystallised sulphate should yield, according to the formula FeSO\u2084, 7 H\u2082O, about 54 per cent. of the anhydrous salt.\n\nA note might be added regarding the mineral Phulm\u0101k, sent by Mr. Hughes-Buller as a mordant in dyeing employed by the Brahuis, or inhabitants of the highlands of Baluchistan. Phulm\u0101k is found in the Koh-i-Sultan, a hill in the Western Sanjrani district. At Kundi, south of the Koh-i-Sultan, some of this \"mak\" was found in the course of sinking a well. The water was consequently very saline and unfit for drinking purposes. The average price paid by the Nashki Banias for Phulm\u0101k varies from Rs. 5 to Rs. 6 per maund. It is said to be used as a mordant while Zagh is used as a dye.\n\nThis mineral has recently been described by Mr. E. Vredenburg in his \"Geological Sketch of the Baluchistan Desert\" (Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India. Vol. xxxi., Pt. 2 (1901), pp. 278-279.) Describing the region of the solfataric volcano, Koh-i-Sultan, Mr. Vredenburg states\u2014\"The clays are impregnated with sulphate of alumina, which is extracted and used as a mordant under the name of \"Koh-mak.\" The efflorescent salt is known as \"Phul-mak.\"\n\nMak is a term given to the soft ferruginous lithomarge, occurring in the hills south of Saindak and in the Koh-i-Sultan, and is collected and carried to Kandahar for dyeing purposes by Kakars and Babars. (T. H. Holland, Records of Geological Survey of India, Vol. xxx., 129) Mak or Lak was also collected by Major G. W. Brazier Creagh, I.M.S., from the Cheltan Range and was reported to give a black dye called Lak-i-Siah with leaves of the Kangak shrub. Specimens examined in the Laboratory of the Geological Survey were pronounced to be yellow marl containing large quantities of sulphate of iron. (Ib., Vol. xxx., 253).\n\nAlthough the substance termed Mak appears to differ in appearance and properties, the identity of the Phulm\u0101k has been set at rest by an examination of two samples sent by Mr. Hughes-Buller.

Little, M.A.\n\nIn a paper which I read at the April meeting of this Society I pointed out that the monsoon season of 1902 could be divided into four periods, in each of which the character of the season as regards the distribution of rainfall and the movement of cyclonic storms which entered India from the Bay of Bengal were noticeably different. I gave a number of tabular statements showing that important changes appeared in the Himalayan region about the 30th of June and the 11th of August, that these changes did not begin over India, and that there was abundant reason for the belief that they approached India from Central Asia, that is, from an easterly or north-easterly direction. I gave the paper the title of \"Two remarkable rainbursts in Bengal,\" because the unexpected occurrence of heavy rainfall in north-eastern India attracted my attention and led to the subsequent investigation.\n\nAlthough the present monsoon season is not yet half over, there have, in my opinion, been already no fewer than three occasions on which the weather in Northern India has been influenced by similar disturbances, that is, by disturbances which have made their first appearance in the region of the Himalayas. I have called them Himalayan storms because they come within our range of observation when they reach the hills; but the probability is that they are due to depressions moving across Central Asia. Their appearance begins with an irregular fall of the barometer at stations in Northern India, and an indraught of winds in that direction: after a longer or shorter period pressure begins to rise, and this rise of pressure is accompanied by the commencement of rainfall, not I believe rainfall of the monsoon type, but the irregularly distributed, and often heavy rainfall caused by numerous thunderstorms.\n\nJ. ii. 33\nThe two storms of 1902 regarding which I gave details in the paper read on April 1st were rapid in their advance and widespread, so that within a few days their influence was felt along almost the whole length of the Himalayas.\n\nThe storms of the present season have been slower in their movement and of limited extent, so that their influence has been confined to sections of Northern India, the latest occurring only a few days ago when the unexpected rainburst in the United Provinces produced so important a change on the agricultural outlook in that region.\n\nIt is not my intention to give details of all these three disturbances, but the middle one of the three is so important, in my opinion, inasmuch as it confirms a conclusion I came to last year after the disturbance of August 11th. That conclusion was that these Himalayan disturbances not only have an influence on the motion of cyclonic storms which cross Northern India from the Bay of Bengal, but they directly contribute to their commencement. The Himalayan storm which entered north-east India on July 8th or 9th, 1903, is in its main features so similar to the storm of June 30th, 1902, and it resembled the storm of August 11th, 1902, in that it was followed by a remarkable series of cyclonic storms over the north of the Bay. Because of these similarities I think it desirable to give tabular statements for it, similar for purposes of comparison with the tables I gave in my previous paper. It will be seen from these tables that pressure began to fall on the 7th in the extreme north-east of Assam, that this fall was general along the Himalayan range on the 8th and 9th and was followed by a rise on the 10th. As these changes extended south-westward over Bengal, rainfall with a rapid fall of temperature became more general\u2014between the 9th and 10th in North and East Bengal and between the 10th and 11th in the western districts. The small charts which are given in the Indian Daily Weather Report, one for the \"variation of 8 A.M. pressure of day from normal,\" and the other \"variation of mean temperature of day from normal,\" show more clearly than the tables the succession of changes which passed over Northern India with that Himalayan storm. The dates for which reference to these charts is suggested are from July 7th to 14th. An examination of the pressure charts will show that pressure was normal along the Himalayas on the 7th and practically over the whole of India. Two days later it was low over Northern India, but still practically normal over the continent. This low pressure area was displaced southward, and by the 13th we have pressure again normal over Northern India and low over the continent; while one depression has formed over the north of the Bay and another in the north-east of the Arabian Sea.\n### Table I.\n\nGiving the pressure change daily from July 7th to July 13th, 1903, arranged to show the southward movement of the disturbance.\n\n|                | July 7th | July 8th | July 9th | July 10th | July 11th | July 12th | July 13th |\n|----------------|----------|----------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Assam          | +\u00b7010''  | \u2212\u00b7026''  | \u2212\u00b7055''  | +\u00b7068''   | +\u00b7001''   | \u2212\u00b7071''   | \u2212\u00b7014''   |\n| North Bengal   | +\u00b7014    | \u2212\u00b7027    | \u2212\u00b7082    | +\u00b7062     | +\u00b7015     | \u2212\u00b7043     | \u2212\u00b7046     |\n| East Bengal    | +\u00b7020    | \u2212\u00b7004    | \u2212\u00b7066    | +\u00b7041     | \u2212\u00b7050     | \u2212\u00b7045     | \u2212\u00b7025     |\n| S.-W.

The figures give the total fall in each division or Province, and the number of stations is given in the first column. The average fall may be obtained by division. It may be seen that rainfall was increasing in Assam and North Bengal from about the 7th, that it was most heavy in those parts on the 9th and 10th, and that\nthe increase in the west and south-west of Bengal is shown on the 11th. No rain fell on the Simla Hills until the 12th and the increase in Kashmir began on the same date.\n\nAs in the storms in 1902, strong southerly or south-westerly winds developed at Saugor Island, and generally over Northern India, showing a strong indraught towards a low pressure area in the north. The contention that no disturbance had formed over India or the adjacent seas previous to these changes in the Himalayan region is supported by the following quotation from the Indian Daily Weather Report of date July 9th, 1903. \"An important change has taken place in the distribution of pressure and very steep gradients favouring strong south-westerly or westerly winds prevail over the greater part of Northern India. These winds are, however, up to the present, dry winds and are not an extension of monsoon winds from the Arabian Sea; hence no rain of any importance may be expected during the next 24 hours in North-West India, though local dust storms may occur in that area.\"\n\nIn the following table I have given the wind direction and strength at Saugor Island for the two periods of disturbed weather in 1902 and for the one under discussion, placed side by side for purpose of comparison. During the advance of these disturbances from the north there was almost the same wind direction and strength at Saugor Island on the three occasions. The direction was south-south-west almost continuously and there was a steady increase of velocity.\n\n| Year | Date | Daily velocity in miles | Wind direction at 8 A.M. |\n|------|------|------------------------|-------------------------|\n| 1902 | June 27 | 312 | S.S.W. |\n|      | August 8 | 360 | S.W. |\n|      | July 7 | 432 | S. |\n|      | August 9 | 504 | S.S.W. |\n|      | July 8 | 552 | S.S.W. |\n|      | August 10 | 768 | S. |\n|      | July 9 | 696 | S.S.W. |\n|      | August 11 | 394 | W.S.W. |\n|      | July 10 | 624 | S.S.W. |\n|      | August 12 | 283 | S.W. |\n|      | July 11 | 408 | S.S.E. |\n|      | August 13 | 384 | W.S.W. |\n|      | July 12 | 168 | E. |\n|      | August 14 | 120 | W.N.W. |\n|      | July 13 | 216 | E.N.E. |\n\nA point of interest which may be noticed in the table is in the wind changes during the days 12th to 14th August, 1902, and 11th to 13th\nJuly, 1903. In the former case the wind turned to northerly through west and in the latter through east. The reason appears to be that the cyclonic storm which developed subsequently over the north of the Bay last year was a little more eastward than this year.\n\nIn the previous paper I gave some facts showing the passage of the disturbance on June 30th, 1902, over Bengal, and more detailed information for Calcutta partly from personal observation. On that occasion the disturbance began to affect weather at Calcutta about 5 A.M., and its progress was shown by the continued fall of temperature. The disturbance this year began about 5 P.M. and came on as last year with a rush of wind from the north accompanied by light rainfall, some thunder and a rapid fall of temperature. The fall of temperature was more rapid than last year, and was in the course of an hour from 92\u00b0 at 5 P.M. to 78\u00b0 at 6 P.M. This greater rapidity was partly due to the disturbance occurring at the end instead of the beginning of the day.\n\nThe barometer at Calcutta was only slightly affected and in much the same way as last year. The small irregularities began about 1 P.M. and a slightly more rapid rise than usual began about 5 P.M., followed by a fall which was completed about 7 P.M.\n\nI have mentioned that since the commencement of the monsoon season there have been several of these disturbances. There were, I believe, between June 13th and July 23rd, no fewer than four, although, with the exception of the one for which tables have been given above, they were not of so well marked a character as to make them useful for establishing the occurrence of such disturbances. They possessed, however, more or less distinctly the characters of the storms which have been more fully described. These characters are\u2014\n\n(1) A fall of pressure along the Himalayan range, followed by a rise, both the fall and the subsequent rise being apparently unconnected with the pressure changes in progress on the plains of India, and having a southward progressive motion.\n\n(2) An indraught from the plains towards the hills shown by strongish south-westerly winds in Northern India.\n\n(3) Unsettled weather in the Himalayas and adjacent plains, with numerous thunderstorms and a rapid fall of temperature.\n\nThe last of these appears to be due to a strong northerly or northeasterly wind from Thibet, across the Himalayas into the upper atmosphere of the Indian plains.\n\nIt is not my intention to prove the existence of the smaller disturbances. It will be sufficient for my purpose if I mention approximately the dates of their occurrence, and these dates can be readily found from J. ii. 34\nthe rainfall at Cherrapoonjee. Owing, probably, to the indraught which these Central Asian storms cause up the Brahmaputra valley, there has been in all cases which I have examined, an increase, at times a very great increase of rainfall at Cherrapoonjee. I do not wish it to be understood that in the occurrence of such heavy rainfall there is proof of a disturbance in Central Asia, but when the rainfall cannot be accounted for by any changes proceeding over India, and the other characters of Himalayan storms can be traced, the rainfall affords a valuable item of evidence. I give in a table below the rainfall for June and July, from which it can be easily seen that there were, during that period, six occasions of increased rainfall, the most noticeable being the falls of 24 and 21 inches on the 9th and 10th July, with the storm I have described above. The other dates approximately were June 10th, June 16th, June 22nd, June 29th, and July 20th.\n\n**Rainfall at Cherrapoonjee.**\n\n| June | Inches | June | Inches | July | Inches | July | Inches |\n|------|--------|------|--------|------|--------|------|--------|\n| 1    | 2      | 17   | 10     | 1    | 2      | 17   | 0      |\n| 2    | 0      | 18   | 6      | 2    | 1      | 18   | 0      |\n| 3    | 0      | 19   | 2      | 3    | 4      | 19   | 2      |\n| 4    | 1      | 20   | 2      | 4    | 3      | 20   | 4      |\n| 5    | 0      | 21   | 3      | 5    | 2      | 21   | 2      |\n| 6    | 0      | 22   | 8      | 6    | 1      | 22   | 2      |\n| 7    | 0      | 23   | 1      | 7    | 3      | 23   | 0      |\n| 8    | 0      | 24   | 0      | 8    | 11     | 24   | 3      |\n| 9    | 7      | 25   | 0      | 9    | 24     | 25   | 2      |\n| 10   | 4      | 26   | 1      | 10   | 21     | 26   | 0      |\n| 11   | 5      | 27   | 8      | 11   | 0      | 27   | 1      |\n| 12   | 0      | 28   | 8      | 12   | 0      | 28   | 0      |\n| 13   | 3      | 29   | 19     | 13   | 0      | 29   | 1      |\n| 14   | 5      | 30   | 0      | 14   | 1      | 30   | 3      |\n| 15   | 8      |      |        | 15   | 0      | 31   | 0      |\n| 16   | 7      |      |        | 16   | 0      |      |        |\nThe occasions on which pressure fell along the Himalayan range were June 9th, June 17th, July 8th, July 18th.\n\nThe disturbances which passed along the Himalayas about the 9th and 17th June appear to have commenced in the north-west and advanced eastward, and they were probably followed by a north-westerly wind in the upper atmosphere. My reason for thinking that the upper wind was north-westerly during the latter part of June is based on the direction in which thunderstorms moved over Bengal during that period. In a paper read by me at the last meeting of the Society I stated that thunderstorms during the past hot season had been abnormal in several respects, the most noticeable being that instead of approaching from the usual north-westerly direction they had without exception come from the west. After the middle of June, thunderstorms continued but they no longer moved from the west. Instead they had become, so far as direction went, typical nor'westers.\n\nA storm of a very exceptional kind began over Orissa in the early morning of the 11th June. It was of the thunderstorm type and moved southward along the coast, causing squally weather in the north of the Circars on the forenoon of that date and in the south in the afternoon. I mention it in this connection as showing the existence of a northerly wind in the upper atmosphere in that region.\n\nAfter a period of continuous low pressure over Northern India from the 17th to the 22nd June, a general rise began along the hills and extended southward. This rise was probably accompanied by an increase of velocity in the upper northerly wind, as a depression which was beginning to form over the Bay, developed over the north-west angle, moved into Chota Nagpur, and then recurved into Bihar and north Bengal. The heavy rainfall at Cherrapoonjee between the 27th and 29th June was caused by this storm, and the recurving was probably due to the north-westerly wind aloft.\n\nThe next occasion of disturbed weather in the Himalayan region was between the 7th and 13th July, and that has been already discussed. The last disturbance began about the 17th July and was very little felt at the eastern end of the Himalayan range. The only indication is the falling pressure in Assam on the 17th and the indraught up the Brahmaputra valley. But in the centre and west of the range there were important developments. Thunderstorms with heavy rainfall and large changes of pressure occurred. This rainfall is very similar to the rainbursts which occurred in Bengal last year, and it is difficult to account for its occurrence by any series of changes then in progress in India. A cyclonic storm was shown in the Indian Daily Weather Report of the 18th, but, as stated under the heading of pressure in that report\nthe depression moved westward. The slight to moderate deficiency of pressure in the United Provinces was not, as was quite natural under the circumstances, recognised as the commencement of the disturbance which was to cause the first heavy rain of the season in the United Provinces, or, as the disturbance developed, the floods in Kashmir. I note these matters to show how unsuspected the rainfall was, and that forms the strongest argument, in my opinion, in favour of the disturbance not being connected directly with the weather changes in progress at that time over India.\n\nThere only remains to point out a few of the more important features of the weather of the past few months as regards storms in the Bay of Bengal and monsoon conditions in Northern India. Throughout the hot season the northerly element in the upper wind was conspicuously absent in Lower Bengal, and whether or not by reason of that abnormal wind direction, not a single depression formed over the Bay up to the middle of June. Then a disturbance appeared over the Himalayas, weather became disturbed over Bengal, and when the final rise of pressure followed, a depression formed over the north-west of the Bay. That storm recurved to the north-east over the western districts of Bengal. Throughout June, rainfall was abundant in Bengal Proper and Assam, but not in the western districts.\n\nThe second stage began with the Himalayan storm of the 10th July. It may be remembered that in 1902 the Himalayan storm of August 11th was followed by a \"remarkable series\" of cyclonic storms which formed at intervals of a week. The first three of these moved westward and saved part of Western India from impending famine. The fourth moved northwards into Chota Nagpur and filled up there. Now this year, since the storm of July 10th, there has been an even more remarkable series of cyclonic storms. At regular intervals of five days four depressions of greater or less intensity have formed in the north-west angle. The dates of commencement of these depressions are July 12th, 17th, 22nd, and 27th. The first was the most severe, and although conditions appeared to be exceptionally favourable for its advance towards Western India it broke up and disappeared about the 15th. The second depression disappeared over Chota Nagpur and the adjacent part of Central India. The third which began in the north-west angle of the Bay on the 22nd moved rapidly westward, was a well-defined depression over the Central Provinces on the 24th, in the Central Indian Plateau on the 25th, and in the north-west dry area on the 26th.\n\nThe behaviour, therefore, of the third depression, was quite different from that of the second which filled up in the Chota Nagpur region. The cause of this change was probably the Himalayan storm of the 19th\nwhich was probably followed by a stronger north-easterly wind overhead. This upper north-easterly wind probably extended southwards over North-Western India and was, I believe, an important factor in maintaining the vitality of the disturbance during its passage westward. The fourth depression has been doubtful. Part of it appears to have moved westward, and part northward into Bengal.\n\nThe rainfall distribution in Northern India has been well-defined, and as in 1902 there has been an evident connection with the Himalayan storms. During June and the first week of July, that is up to the occurrence of the more decided Himalayan storm of July 10th, rainfall was almost entirely confined to Bengal and Assam. After that disturbance passed over Bengal and cyclonic storms began at the head of the Bay the character of the rainfall changed in Bengal. Only light scattered showers fell. On the other hand, rainfall became more general in Central India, and, after the Himalayan storm which began in the western half of the range about the 19th, rainfall became general in the extreme west.\n\nThe behaviour of the last depression of the series shows that the change produced by these Himalayan storms in Bengal is coming to an end, and while I write cloud is increasing and ordinary monsoon weather is becoming general over this Province.\n\nIt should be noticed how the west of Bihar appears to have been very little affected by either of the more important of the Himalayan storms. The one of the 10th July was probably confined more, as regards after-effects, to Bengal, and that of the 19th July to the north-west. The result has been that the west of Bihar and the adjacent part of the United Provinces have, during the three months ending with July, received less rain than they usually receive during June alone.\nOn the life-history of Arbela tetraonis, Moore, a destructive Insect pest in Casuarina Plantations in Madras.\u2014By E. P. Stebbing.\n\n[Received July 25th. Read August 5th, 1903.]\n\nHow little is really known about our Insect foes in India is becoming increasingly evident day by day. An insect suddenly swarms over an area in numbers owing to some particularly favourable conditions in its surroundings, it commits serious depredations in the fields, orchards, or forests of the tract it is invading, and owing to its being so very much en \u00e9vidence or owing to the great damage it is committing specimens are collected and sent for identification to specialists. The odds are greatly in favour of its being new to science. Instances of this state of affairs are numerous, and it may be said that leaving out of account the butterflies and one or two other groups which have received attention it is easier to pick up a new species in many parts of the country than to collect one that is known. The insect about whose life-history, as far as it is at present known, I wish here to put on record a few notes furnishes an illustration of the aptness of the above remarks, since although rare in Collections and new to those of the Indian Museum its larva has been known for some years as a destructive bark eater in Casuarina plantations on the eastern seaboard of Madras. There may, however, be said to be some excuse for its having remained so long undiscovered since it belongs to a family of moths, closely allied to the Cossid\u00e6, which have been little studied and the life histories of whose members are little known, the larv\u00e6 living mostly in the wood of trees. The moths are rarely seen and owing to the habits of the larva are difficult to find. The pupal stage and pupa of the English Goat-moth is known, and has been described; but very little is known as to other pup\u00e6 of the family. The description of the pupal stage of this insect given below is therefore of some interest.\n\nIn the Indian Museum we have but 4 genera and 11 species of the family Cossid\u00e6 from the Indian Region, the insects being Cossus cadambe, Duomitus ceramicus, D. strix, D. lenconotus, D. mineus, Azygophleps asylas (said to be S. African by Hampson in the Fauna), A. pusilla, Zeuzera indica, Z. pyrina, Z. multistrigata, and Z. Coffe\u00e6. There are also two unnamed specimens one of which is an Arbela and closely allied to the insect under description. This latter specimen was obtained by the late\nMr. De Nic\u00e9ville and is labelled Calcutta 1891. It is the only representative of the *Arbelidae* in the Museum Collections. The genus *Arbela* has a fairly wide range, inhabiting, according to Hampson, Peninsular India, Ceylon, and Burma.\n\nThe species here described appears to infest most of the Casuarina plantations on the Madras Eastern Seaboard. Hampson records it only from Poona, Bombay, and Raipur.\n\nHampson gives the description of the genus as follows: Palpi minute, antenna bipectinated to tips in male, the branches short, simple in female. Mid and hind tibiae slightly hairy with terminal pairs of spurs. Forewing with veins 7, 8, 9 stalked together. Hindwing with cell of normal length; vein 6 given off below the angle; vein connected with the subcostal nervure by an oblique bar near centre of cell.\n\n*Arbela tetraonis*, Moore, P.Z.S., 1879, p. 411, pl. 34, fig. 3; C. & S., No. 1605; Hampson. F. Br. Ind. Moths I. 315, No. 675, (\u2640).\n\n\u2642 Head and thorax covered with long silky brown hairs. Abdomen with long greyish hairs. Forewing greyish, thickly irrorated with dull-brown spots which tend to form transverse bands; three large velvety-brown patches, one centrally, placed a little below the costa, a second near the base of the wing, and the third, the largest, a little beyond it.\n\nHindwing grey irrorated with a few ashy-coloured spots and a dark marginal band. Exp. 43 millim.\n\n\u2640 Already described by Hampson.\n\n*Larva.* Head black with a few longish yellowish-white hairs on it. Following three segments, which each bear a pair of long legs, yellowish, this colour merging into pink on the third. These three segments are swollen and larger than the head. The following segments are flesh-coloured except the last which is yellowish. Five pairs of short sucker legs are present, one pair each on the 6th to 9th and a pair on the last segment. A few long scattered whitish hairs on each of the segments. These nine segments are narrower than the first three and taper off slightly behind so that the 12th segment has only about the diameter of the 4th. Length \u00bd\". Width of thoracic segments 3-16ths inch.\n\n*Pupa.* Very shining, yellowish-brown merging into black at anterior end. Circular in section and of uniform thickness throughout except for a slight swelling at thoracic end, which is furnished at the top with two small spiny spikes; the last segment tapers bluntly. Wing covers short, shining yellowish-brown posteriorly merging into black above. Abdominal segments visible, 7 to 8 dorsally, 5 ventrally. The last 5 bear transverse circular rows of fine saw-like closely set black teeth upon them, the first three segments having a double row placed\nslightly apart near the centre whilst the last two have but one encircling band situated near the centre. The last segment is blunt at its posterior extremity where it is furnished with a circle of irregularly sized black spines. The two segments visible dorsally immediately anterior to the first of those bearing the double encircling girdle of teeth have each a single row of closely set curved teeth placed near their anterior margins which end on either side at the wing covers Long. 21 to 28 millim.\n\nAs we shall see later the presence of these spines is absolutely essential to the pupa since by their means it is able to make its way from the heart of the tree where the larva pupates to the outside in order to provide for the escape of the moth.\n\nThe appearance of the moth on the wing is evidently very variable. In the Godaveri district a report states that the insect issued as early as March. A specimen taken in 1901 and preserved for transmission to me got damaged and so was not sent, but I have little doubt from the descriptions given that the insect was the *Arbela*. In Ganjam on the other hand a specimen was bred from a pupa by Mr. C. E. C. Fischer, of the Imperial Forest Service, as late as the 3rd July of the present year. The specimen so bred is the only one that has been yet recorded from the Casuarina Plantations of Madras, and should the one in the Indian Museum taken by Mr. De Nic\u00e9ville in 1891 prove a different species, it forms the only record of the species that I am aware of in India. When I state that I have seen probably several dozen empty pupal cases upon the trunks of the trees in one small plantation alone, it will be obvious that although in its particular locality so plentiful it is not often taken.\n\nFrom Cuddalore nearly mature pupae were sent to me on June 1st. It would thus appear that the moth is to be found on the wing between March and beginning of July. I could find none in a plantation at Chatrapur (Ganjam) between the 9th and 13th July, 1903, although I noted numbers of the empty pupal cases on the Casuarina trees.\n\nSince the moths of this family are unprovided with a proboscis and consequently take no food at this stage of their lives they probably lay eggs soon after emerging. The eggs are deposited upon the bark of the trees. We do not yet know what period elapses before they hatch out. Ganjam being situated in the N.-E. corner of the Presidency gets the S.-W. Monsoon which bursts about the middle of July and consequently the eggs would probably not hatch out until September or October, after the worst of the rains are over. Further south, however, where this monsoon is not felt and the rain is not received until October and November they may hatch out earlier. The at present recorded months in which larvae have been obtained are January and March in Chatrapur (with pupa\nin June and a moth on 3rd July); December in North Arcot (with pupa in June); the same month in Godaveri (with pupa and moth in March); full-grown caterpillars and almost mature pupae in Cuddalore on June 1st and what appear to be nearly mature larvae in Nellore also in June.\n\nWe have yet to ascertain the period spent by the larvae in this stage of its existence. In some instances in the case of allied families two to three years are passed in this stage. So little is known about the larvae of this and the Cossidae that only the caterpillars of Duomitus niger (the 'black borer' of coffee planters) and Zeuzera coffeae (the white borer of coffee planters), are described in the Fauna and no larvae of the Arbelidae. They are considered to spend nearly, if not over, a year in the larval stage. In the case under consideration I am of opinion that the larva spends less than a year in the grub stage, and the difference may be due to the fact that whilst the former two feed on wood the latter confines itself until full-grown to a bark diet. Whatever the period may be however which the larvae passes in its grub stage the greater portion of it is spent upon the bark of the tree and not inside the wood.\n\nI have said that the eggs are laid upon the bark, and they may be so deposited in patches, and if so the young larvae may be gregarious for a time after hatching out. This is to some extent borne out by the fact that the thinner bark of the trees is seen to be eaten off in patches. If they are however gregarious at first this condition would not appear to last long since the greater part of the larval life is spent in a solitary state, and at this period the grub constructs for itself a covered-way gallery resembling a glorified termite gallery running up the outside of the bark. This covered way is formed of particles of its excreta bound together with a fine silk. Externally the appearance is simply that of a mass of excrementous particles. These covered ways curl round or run up or down the stem of the tree and are very conspicuous, being from one-third to one-half inch in breadth externally and from nine inches to as much as eighteen inches in length. They are reddish-brown to, in parts, black in colour and form raised galleries on the surface. Sometimes the gallery completely encircles the stem, the tree being then ringed; at others it is taken in a spiral manner up or down the tree. The covered ways have a more or less uniform width throughout their length and from their appearance the larva would seem to add to them at the sides so that the internal chamber remains uniform in width throughout its length. Generally only two to three of these galleries are to be found upon any one tree and then generally far apart, and it would therefore appear probable that if a considerable number of eggs are laid together in a patch there must be a high mortal-\nity amongst the young larv\u00e6. The foliage of the Casuarina is very thin and open and a caterpillar feeding in the open on the bark would be very visible to bird and other depredators. It is, therefore, within the bounds of probability that the caterpillars suffer heavily in this manner in early life and that the grub has developed the habit of living in a protective tunnel to safeguard itself from these attacks. During the whole period it spends upon the trunk of the tree the larva feeds upon the bark eating this latter away either in thin irregular-shaped patches in places adjacent to its covered gallery or gnawing it right through down to the wood below under the shelter given it by the covered way itself. In this way the tree is at times very nearly girdled, and if a number of larv\u00e6 are working close together the result is probably the death of the tree. Some trees seemed to be more preferred than others, several moths resorting to them to oviposit. In such cases it often happens that one or more of the covered ways made by the larv\u00e6 developing from the eggs meet at a kind of junction and a large mass of excrement and silk forms a great bulge on the tree from which, if the moths have flown, several empty pupal cases may be seen protruding quite close to one another. When full fed the larv\u00e6 returns down its covered way until it has reached to about the centre and then bores horizontally into the tree, going deep to the centre of the heart wood. This tunnel is kept quite clean all the wood particles being ejected from it. When it has arrived there after making a tunnel which may be as long as six or more inches though in smaller trees it is considerably less, it slightly enlarges the chamber, turns round in it and pupates. This tunnel in the wood is only bored by the larva for pupating purposes. It does not ramify about in the wood as would be the case if the grub were feeding in the wood.\n\nFrom the periods at which both larv\u00e6 pup\u00e6 and moths have been found it is probable that the time passed as a pupa is short, probably a month at most. When the moth is nearly ready to emerge the pupa projects itself along the tunnel by wriggling forward with the help of the rows of spines with which its outer covering is garnished. On reaching the end of the tunnel it forces its way through the covered way from the outer surface of which it projects for about one-fourth of its length. The case then splits down anteriorly and the moth crawls out. These empty pupal cases found projecting in this manner from the covered ways enable a period to be roughly fixed for the term of pupation. Under the action of the monsoon rain they soon get soaked and sodden and fall off the tree, and it is thus certain that but a few weeks are passed by the insect in this quiescent stage of its existence.\n\nThe points which still remain uncertain are the exact length of\ntime spent as a feeding larv\u00e6, the number of eggs laid, and the time spent before they hatch out.\n\nIn addition to the scientific instinct which attaches to the taking of this insect and to the study of its life-history both, owing to the little known about the habits of the family, of some importance there is another aspect, the economic one, which is equally deserving of attention. The Casuarina has been planted, and is being planted, in Madras with two objects in view; the one, to protect the cultivated lands or towns and villages, roads, &c., from the encroachments of moving sand dunes, and secondly, to provide timber and fuel for the inhabitants in areas where the only other tree growth is palm trees. The action of the larv\u00e6 of this moth by which trees are often killed off and plantations or portion of them ruined is therefore of some importance.\nINDEX.\n\nNames of New Genera and Species have an asterisk (*) prefixed.\n\nAbies Webbiana, 57\nAcranthera Maingayi, 182\n  mutabilis, 182\nAdenosacme, 117, 196\n  longifolia, 196\n  Malayana, 197\n*  Scortechinii, 196, 197\nAdenosma, 16\n  caeruleum, 16\n  capitatum, 16\n  cuspidatum, 14, 15\n  hirsutum, 16\n  inopinatum, 16\n  macrophyllum, 14, 16\n  ovatum, 16\n  subrepens, 16\nAdina, 115, 126\n  aralioides, 127\n  polycephala, 126, 127\n  var. macrophylla, 127\n  rubescens, 126\nAlectra 20\n  Thomsoni, 20\nAleurodes, 66\n*  alcocki, 74\n*  bambusa, 85\n  barodensis, 90, 92\n  bengalensis, 70\n  citri, 91, 92\n  cotesii, 90, 93, 94\n  eugeniae, 84, 90, 91, 91\n  var. aurantii, 84, 90, 91\n  fugi, 94\n  gelatinosus, 77\n  gossypii, 90\n*  hoyei, 88\n  lactea, 90\n*  leakii, 87\n  longicera, 67\n  longicornis, 90\n  melicyti, 91\n  nubilans, 90, 95\n  piperis, 90, 94\n*  proletella, 91\n*  guianancei, 68, 78\n*  religiosa, 67, 68\n  rubi, 67\n  sacchari, 95\n\n*Aleurodes simula, 7, 81, 84\nAleurodicus, 65, 66\nALEURODID\u00c6, 6, 61, 62, 65, 66, 90\nAnomanthodia auriculata, 207\n?

From 1894 an additional volume, Part III has been issued.\n\nThe Proceedings up to the year 1864 were bound up with the Journal, but since that date have been separately issued every year.\n\nThe following is a list of the Asiatic Society's publications relating to Physical Science, still in print, which can be obtained at the Society's House, No. 57, Park Street, Calcutta, or from the Society's Agents in London, Messrs. Luzac & Co., 46, Great Russell Street, W. C.; and from Mr. Otto Harrassowitz, Leipzig, Germany:\n\n**Asiatic Researches.** Vols. VII, Vols. XI and XVII, and Vols. XIX and XX @ 10/ each ...
